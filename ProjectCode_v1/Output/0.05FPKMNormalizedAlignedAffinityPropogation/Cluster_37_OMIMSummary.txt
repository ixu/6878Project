DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using differential display analysis, Pettersson et al. (2000) identified
mouse myeloid-associated differentiation marker (Myadm) based upon its
varied expression during differentiation of an Il3 (147740)-dependent
myeloid progenitor cell line established from mouse bone marrow. The
deduced protein contains 8 potential transmembrane domains and several
potential phosphorylation sites. Northern blot analysis on hematopoietic
cell lines revealed restricted expression of Myadm to cells belonging to
the myeloid lineage. Expression was also seen in mature granulocytes and
macrophages. Tissue analysis showed high expression of Myadm in lung and
more moderate expression in bone marrow and brain. RT-PCR experiments
demonstrated expression of Myadm in multipotent cells
(c-kit+Sca-1+Lin-), erythroid progenitors, and early lymphoid
progenitors.

By database searching with mouse Myadm as query, Cui et al. (2002)
identified human MYADM and cloned a full-length MYADM sequence from a
human bone marrow cDNA library. The deduced 298-amino acid protein has a
predicted molecular mass of 32 kD. It contains 7 predicted transmembrane
domains and shows sequence homology with the T-cell differentiation
protein MAL (188860) and plasmolipin (PLMP; 600340). MYADM shares 75.8%
overall sequence identity with mouse Myadm, with highest levels of
conservation seen in the predicted transmembrane regions. Northern blot
analysis detected 3.3- and 2.2-kb MYADM transcripts. Expression of the
longer transcript was seen in all tissues tested except thymus;
expression of the shorter transcript was seen in heart, placenta, lung,
pancreas, testis, and peripheral blood leukocytes and was undetectable
in all other tissues. Semiquantitative PCR assays showed that expression
of MYADM was not only significantly higher in peripheral blood
leukocytes than in bone marrow cells, but was also upregulated in NB4
cells (derived from a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia) that
were treated with the differentiation inducer all-trans retinoic acid
(ATRA).

GENE FUNCTION

Using antisense Myadm oligonucleotides, Pettersson et al. (2000) showed
that downregulation of mouse Myadm expression in pluripotent
hematopoietic progenitor cells inhibited colony formation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Cui et al. (2002) determined that the MYADM gene contains 3 exons and
spans 7.1 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Cui et al. (2002) mapped the MYADM gene to
chromosome 19q13.33-q13.4.

601693	TITLE *601693 UNCOUPLING PROTEIN 2; UCP2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The mitochondrial protein called uncoupling protein (UCP1; 113730) plays
an important role in generating heat and burning calories by creating a
pathway that allows dissipation of the proton electrochemical gradient
across the inner mitochondrial membrane in brown adipose tissue, without
coupling to any other energy-consuming process. Fleury et al. (1997)
noted that this pathway has been implicated in the regulation of body
temperature, body composition, and glucose metabolism. However,
UCP1-containing brown adipose tissue is unlikely to be involved in
weight regulation in adult large-size animals and in humans living in a
thermoneutral environment, i.e., one in which an animal does not have to
increase oxygen consumption or energy expenditure to lose or gain heat
to maintain body temperature, as there is little brown adipose tissue
present in the adults. Fleury et al. (1997) discovered a gene that codes
for a novel uncoupling protein they designated UCP2, which has 59% amino
acid identity to UCP1. It was found to have properties consistent with a
role in diabetes and obesity (see 601665). In comparison with UCP1, UCP2
had a greater effect on the mitochondrial membrane potential when
expressed in yeast. Compared to UCP1, UCP2 is widely expressed in adult
human tissues, including tissue rich in macrophages, and it is
upregulated in white fat in response to fat feeding.

Flier and Lowell (1997) characterized the work reported by Fleury et al.
(1997) as a 'major breakthrough towards understanding the molecular
basis for energy expenditure.' They considered these findings likely to
have important implications for the causes and treatment of human
obesity.

GENE FUNCTION

Bouchard et al. (1997) studied the linkage relationships between 3
microsatellite markers that encompass the UCP2 gene location on 11q13
with resting metabolic rate (RMR), body mass index, percentage body fat,
and fat mass in 640 individuals from 155 pedigrees in the Quebec family
study. Suggestive evidence of linkage led them to conclude that the 3
markers encompassing the UCP2 locus and spanning a 5-cM region on 11q13
are linked to resting energy expenditure in adult humans. The evidence
was strong enough, in their opinion, to warrant a search for DNA
sequence variation in the gene itself.

Millet et al. (1997) observed an increase in the levels of UCP2 and UCP3
(602044) mRNA in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue from both lean and
obese individuals undergoing fasting. They suggested that the increase
indicates a role for these proteins in the metabolic adaptation to
fasting. The similar induction of gene expression observed during
fasting in lean and obese subjects show that there is no major
alteration of UCP2 and UCP3 gene regulation in adipose tissue and
skeletal muscle of obese subjects. UCP2 is widely expressed in human
tissues, whereas UCP3 expression seems to be restricted to skeletal
muscle, an important site of thermogenesis in humans.

Hepatic hematopoiesis is prominent during fetal life and ceases around
birth. Brauner et al. (2001) characterized hepatic hematopoiesis in
humans around birth and identified cells expressing UCP2. Hematopoiesis
was evaluated histologically in the liver of 22 newborns (mostly very
premature neonates), who died between 45 minutes and 140 days after
birth, and 1 fetus. UCP2 expression was characterized by Northern blots,
immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, and by in situ hybridization. The
number of hematopoietic cells started to decrease rapidly at birth,
irrespective of gestational age (23 to 40 weeks) of neonates. A similar
decline was observed for UCP2 expression, which was relatively high in
fetal liver. UCP2 was detected only in myeloid cells (mainly in Kupffer
cells), but not in hepatocytes, although sepsis or other pathologies
occurred in the critically ill newborns. Kupffer cells represent the
major site of mitochondrial UCP2 expression in the human newborn. UCP2
may be essential for the differentiation and function of macrophages and
serve as a marker for these cells in human liver during the perinatal
period.

UCP1 diverts energy from ATP synthesis to thermogenesis in the
mitochondria of brown adipose by catalyzing a regulated leak of protons
across the inner membrane. UCP2 and UCP3 are present at much lower
abundance than UCP1, and the uncoupling with which they are associated
is not significantly thermogenic. Mild uncoupling would, however,
decrease the mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS),
which are important mediators of oxidative damage. Echtay et al. (2002)
demonstrated that superoxide increases mitochondrial proton conductance
through effects on UCP1, UCP2, and UCP3. Superoxide-induced uncoupling
requires fatty acids and is inhibited by purine nucleotides.
Superoxide-induced uncoupling correlates with the tissue expression of
UCPs and appears in mitochondria from yeast expressing UCP1. Skeletal
muscle mitochondria express only UCP3h; therefore superoxide-induced
uncoupling is absent in the skeletal muscle of UCP3 knockout mice.
Echtay et al. (2002) concluded that the interaction of superoxide with
UCPs may be a mechanism for decreasing the concentrations of ROS inside
mitochondria.

Neuronal cell death usually occurs after a certain period of ischemia,
suggesting that neurons are able to sustain sublethal damage up to a
threshold level, presumably through endogenous protective pathways.
Using subtractive cDNA libraries and cDNA array analysis of CA1 fields
of rat hippocampi at multiple times after ischemic preconditioning,
Mattiasson et al. (2003) identified UCP2 as an inducible neuroprotective
protein. In mice overexpressing human UCP2, brain damage was diminished
after experimental stroke and traumatic brain injury, and neurologic
recovery was enhanced. In cultured cortical neurons, UCP2 reduced cell
death and inhibited caspase-3 (600636) activation induced by oxygen and
glucose deprivation. In isolated mitochondria, UCP2 shifted the release
of ROS from the mitochondrial matrix to the extramitochondrial space.
Mattiasson et al. (2003) suggested that UCP2 is neuroprotective by
activating cellular redox signaling or by inducing mild mitochondrial
uncoupling that prevents the release of apoptogenic proteins.

Sullivan et al. (2003) noted that, in rats, the immature brain is
remarkably resistant to seizure-induced excitotoxic cell death compared
to adults. They found that seizures did not increase the formation of
ROS in neonatal brain because of the presence of high levels of UCP2,
which mediates uncoupling in mitochondria (see also Echtay et al.,
2002). UCP2 expression and function were increased in neonatal brain by
the fat-rich diet of maternal milk, and Sullivan et al. (2003) found
that dietary restriction of free fatty acids rendered immature rat
limbic neurons vulnerable to seizure-induced neuronal injury.

Wisloff et al. (2005) hypothesized that artificial selection of rats
based on low and high intrinsic exercise capacity would yield models
that also contrast for cardiovascular disease risk. After 11
generations, rats with low aerobic capacity scored higher on
cardiovascular risk factors that constitute the metabolic syndrome. The
decrease in aerobic capacity was associated with decreases in the
amounts of transcription factors required for mitochondrial biogenesis
and in the amounts of oxidative enzymes in skeletal muscle. Wisloff et
al. (2005) found that the amount of PPARG (601487), PPARG
coactivator-1-alpha (PPARGC1A; 604517), ubiquinol-cytochrome c
oxidoreductase core 2 subunit (UQCRC2; 191329), cytochrome c oxidase
subunit I (MTCO1; 516030), uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2), and ATP synthase
H(+)-transporting mitochondrial F1 complex (F1-ATP synthase; see 108729)
were markedly reduced in the low capacity runner rats in comparison with
the high capacity runners. The uniform decline in these proteins was
consistent with the hypothesis that reduced aerobic metabolism plays a
causal role in the development of the differences between the low
capacity runner and high capacity runner rats. Wisloff et al. (2005)
concluded that impairment of mitochondrial function may link reduced
fitness to cardiovascular and metabolic disease.

Parton et al. (2007) disrupted glucose sensing in glucose-excited
proopiomelanocortin (POMC; 176830) neurons via transgenic expression of
a mutant Kir6.2 subunit (encoded by the Kcnj11 gene, 600937) that
prevents ATP-mediated closure of potassium-ATP channels. They showed
that this genetic manipulation impaired the whole body response to a
systemic glucose load, demonstrating a role for glucose sensing by POMC
neurons in the overall physiologic control of blood glucose. Parton et
al. (2007) also found that glucose sensing by POMC neurons became
defective in obese mice on a high-fat diet, suggesting that loss of
glucose sensing by neurons has a role in the development of type 2
diabetes. The mechanism for obesity-induced loss of glucose sensing in
POMC neurons involves UCP2, a mitochondrial protein that impairs
glucose-stimulated production. UCP2 negatively regulates glucose sensing
in POMC neurons. Parton et al. (2007) found that genetic deletion of
UCP2 prevented obesity-induced loss of glucose sensing, and that acute
pharmacologic inhibition of UCP2 reverses loss of glucose sensing.
Parton et al. (2007) concluded that obesity-induced, UCP2-mediated loss
of glucose sensing in glucose-excited neurons might have a pathogenic
role in the development of type 2 diabetes.

Andrews et al. (2008) showed that ghrelin (605353) initiates robust
changes in hypothalamic mitochondrial respiration in mice that are
dependent on UCP2. Activation of this mitochondrial mechanism is
critical for ghrelin-induced mitochondrial proliferation and electric
activation of NPY (162640)/AgRP (602311) neurons, for ghrelin-triggered
synaptic plasticity of POMC neurons, and for ghrelin-induced food
intake. The UCP2-dependent action of ghrelin on NPY/AgRP neurons is
driven by a hypothalamic fatty acid oxidation pathway involving AMPK
(see 602739), CPT1 (600528), and free radicals that are scavenged by
UCP2. Andrews et al. (2008) concluded that their results revealed a
signaling modality connecting mitochondria-mediated effects of G
protein-coupled receptors on neuronal function and associated behavior.

By immunohistochemical analysis of dispersed and intact mouse pancreatic
islets and mouse pancreatic cell lines, Diao et al. (2008) found that
alpha cells expressed significantly higher levels of Ucp2 than did beta
cells. Alpha cells also showed greater Ucp2-dependent mitochondrial
uncoupling compared with beta cells, which was accompanied by a lower
oxidative phosphorylation efficiency. Conversely, reducing Ucp2 activity
in alpha cells was associated with higher mitochondrial membrane
potential generated by glucose oxidation and with increased ATP
synthesis, indicating more efficient metabolic coupling. In vitro,
suppression of Ucp2 activity led to reduced glucagon secretion in
response to low glucose; however, in vivo, fasting glucagon levels were
normal in Ucp2-knockout mice. Ucp2 also appeared to be cytoprotective of
islet cells, with Ucpp2-knockout alpha cells being more sensitive than
wildtype cells to toxic stimuli.

Park et al. (2011) showed that the mitochondrial membrane potential of
the phagocyte critically controls engulfment capacity, with lower
potential enhancing engulfment and vice versa. The mitochondrial
membrane protein Ucp2, which acts to lower the mitochondrial membrane
potential, was upregulated in phagocytes engulfing apoptotic cells. Loss
of Ucp2 reduced phagocytic capacity, whereas Ucp2 overexpression
enhanced engulfment. Mutational and pharmacologic studies indicated a
direct role for Ucp2-mediated mitochondrial function in phagocytosis.
Macrophages from Ucp2-deficient mice were impaired in phagocytosis in
vitro, and Ucp2-deficient mice showed profound in vivo defects in
clearing dying cells in the thymus and testes. Park et al. (2011)
concluded that the mitochondrial membrane potential and Ucp2 are key
molecular determinants of apoptotic cell clearance.

GENE STRUCTURE

Pecqueur et al. (1999) determined that the UCP2 gene contains 8 exons
and spans 8 kb. Exons 1 and 2 are not translated. The promoter region
does not contain a TATA box or a CAAT box, but it is GC rich, unlike
UCP1.

MAPPING

Fleury et al. (1997) mapped the UCP2 gene to human 11q13 by using 2
independent sequence tagged sites derived from human UCP2 clones. They
also mapped the mouse homolog Ucp2 to murine chromosome 7, tightly
linked to the 'tubby' mutation (601197), in an area of homology of
synteny to 11q13. Furthermore, the chromosomal mapping of UCP2 was
coincident with quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for obesity in at least 3
independent mouse models, one congenic strain, and human
insulin-dependent diabetes locus-4 (600319).

Pecqueur et al. (1999) determined that the UCP2 gene is located 7 kb
downstream of the UCP3 gene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The UCP2-UCP3 gene cluster maps to 11q13 in humans. Walder et al. (1998)
explored the possibility that polymorphisms in these genes may
contribute to obesity through effects on energy metabolism. DNA
sequencing showed 3 polymorphisms informative for association studies:
an ala-to-val substitution in exon 4 of UCP2, a 45-bp insertion/deletion
in the 3-prime untranslated region of exon 8 of UCP2, and a C-to-T
silent polymorphism in exon 3 of UCP3. Initially, 82 young (mean age =
30 +/- 7 years), unrelated, full-blooded, nondiabetic Pima Indians were
typed for these polymorphisms by direct sequencing. The 3 sites were in
linkage disequilibrium with each other (P = less than 0.00001). The UCP2
variants were associated with metabolic rate during sleep. Heterozygotes
for UCP2 variants had higher metabolic rates than homozygotes. The UCP3
variant was not significantly associated with metabolic rate or obesity.
In a further 790 full-blooded Pima Indians, there was no significant
association between the insertion/deletion polymorphism and body mass
index (BMI). However, when only individuals more than 45 years of age
were considered, heterozygotes (subjects with the highest sleeping
metabolic rate) had the lowest BMI (P = 0.04). Walder et al. (1998)
concluded that UCP2 (or UCP3) contributes to variation in metabolic rate
in young Pima Indians which may contribute to overall body fat content
later in life.

Esterbauer et al. (2001) showed that a common G/A polymorphism in the
UCP2 promoter region is associated with enhanced adipose tissue mRNA
expression in vivo and results in increased transcription of a reporter
gene in the human adipocyte cell line PAZ-6. In analyzing 340 obese and
256 never-obese middle-aged subjects, they found a modest but
significant reduction in obesity prevalence associated with the
less-common allele. They confirmed this association in a
population-based sample of 791 middle-aged subjects from the same
geographic area (Salzburg, Austria). Despite its modest effect, but
because of its high frequency (approximately 63%), the more-common risk
allele conferred a relatively large population-attributable risk
accounting for 15% of the obesity in the population studied.

ANIMAL MODEL

Enerback et al. (1997) determined the role of UCP in the regulation of
body mass by targeted inactivation of the UCP gene in mice. They found
that UCP-deficient mice consumed less oxygen after treatment with a
beta-3-adrenergic receptor agonist and that they were sensitive to cold,
indicating that thermoregulation was defective. However, this deficiency
caused neither hyperphagia nor obesity in mice fed on either a standard
or a high-fat diet. Enerback et al. (1997) proposed that the loss of UCP
may be compensated by UCP2, a homolog of UCP that is ubiquitously
expressed and is induced in the brown fat of UCP-deficient mice.

As Ucp2 is widely expressed in mammalian tissues, uncouples respiration,
and resides within a region of genetic linkage to obesity, a role in
energy dissipation had been proposed. Arsenijevic et al. (2000)
demonstrated, however, that mice lacking Ucp2 following targeted gene
disruption were not obese and had a normal response to cold exposure or
high-fat diet. Expression of Ucp2 is normally robust in spleen, lung,
and isolated macrophages, suggesting a role for Ucp2 in immunity or
inflammatory responsiveness. In this connection, Arsenijevic et al.
(2000) found that Ucp2 -/- mice were completely resistant to infection
with Toxoplasma gondii, in contrast with the lethality observed in
wildtype littermates. Macrophages from the Ucp2-null mice generated more
ROS than wildtype mice in response to T. gondii, and had a 5-fold
greater toxoplasmacidal activity in vitro compared with wildtype mice,
which was absent in the presence of a quencher of ROS. Their results
indicated a role for Ucp2 in the limitation of ROS and
macrophage-mediated immunity.

Zhang et al. (2001) assessed the role of UCP2 in regulating insulin
secretion. Ucp2-deficient mice had higher islet ATP levels and increased
glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, establishing that UCP2 negatively
regulates insulin secretion. Of pathophysiologic significance, Ucp2 was
markedly upregulated in islets of ob/ob mice, a model of obesity-induced
diabetes. Ob/ob mice lacking Ucp2 had restored first-phase insulin
secretion, increased serum insulin levels, and greatly decreased levels
of glycemia. These results established UCP2 as a key component of
beta-cell glucose sensing and as a critical link between obesity,
beta-cell dysfunction, and type II diabetes.

Failure to secrete adequate amounts of insulin in response to increasing
concentrations of glucose is an important feature of type II diabetes.
UCP2, by virtue of its mitochondrial proton leak activity and consequent
negative effect on ATP production, impairs glucose-stimulated insulin
secretion. Superoxide, when added to isolated mitochondria, activates
UCP2-mediated proton leak (Echtay et al., 2002). Because obesity and
chronic hyperglycemia increase mitochondrial superoxide production, as
well as UCP2 expression in pancreatic beta cells, Krauss et al. (2003)
hypothesized that a superoxide-UCP2 pathway could contribute importantly
to obesity- and hyperglycemia-induced beta cell dysfunction. They
demonstrated that in mice, endogenously produced mitochondrial
superoxide activated Ucp2-mediated proton leak, thus lowering ATP levels
and impairing glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Furthermore,
hyperglycemia- and obesity-induced loss of glucose responsiveness was
prevented by reduction of mitochondrial superoxide production or gene
knockout of Ucp2. Importantly, reduction of superoxide had no beneficial
effect in the absence of Ucp2, and superoxide levels were increased
further in the absence of Ucp2, demonstrating that the adverse effects
of superoxide on beta cell glucose sensing are caused by activation of
UCP2. Krauss et al. (2003) concluded that superoxide-mediated activation
of UCP2 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of beta cell
dysfunction and type II diabetes.

Conti et al. (2006) engineered transgenic mice to overexpress Ucp2 in
hypocretin neurons (Hcrt-Ucp2) and reported that these mice had elevated
hypothalamic temperature. The effects of local temperature elevation on
the central thermostat resulted in a 0.3- to 0.5-degree Celsius
reduction of the core body temperature. Fed ad libitum, Hcrt-UCP2
transgenic mice had the same caloric intake as their wildtype
littermates but had increased energy efficiency and a greater median
life span (12% increase in males; 20% increase in females). Thus, Conti
et al. (2006) concluded that modest sustained reduction of core body
temperature prolonged life span independent of altered diet or calorie
restriction.

Emre et al. (2007) showed that streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes was
strongly accelerated in Ucp2-knockout mice compared with wildtype mice.
STZ-treated Ucp2-knockout mice showed increased intraislet lymphocyte
and macrophage infiltration, increased Il1b (147720) and nitric oxide
production from macrophages, and increased nitric oxide/ROS-induced
damage compared with STZ-treated wildtype mice.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
OBESITY, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
UCP2, -866G-A

Esterbauer et al. (2001) found an association between obesity (see
BMIQ4, 607447) and a common G/A polymorphism (dbSNP rs659366) in the
UCP2 promoter region at position -866. The G/G and G/A genotypes were
more frequent in the obese group than in the never-obese group.

Bulotta et al. (2005) studied the distribution of the -866G/A UCP2 SNP
in 746 type 2 diabetes patients and 327 healthy unrelated Caucasians
from Italy. Compared with -866G/G carriers, a progressively reduced (P =
0.01) risk of type 2 diabetes was observed in -866G/A and -866A/A
subjects, with the latter showing an approximately 50% risk reduction
(OR = 0.51; 95% CI 0.3-0.8; P = 0.003). Conversely, the -866G/G genotype
was associated with increased risk (OR = 1.31; 95% CI, 1.01-1.71).
Overall, the population risk attributable to the UCP2 -866G/G genotype
was about 12%. Bulotta et al. (2005) also tested for an effect of the
P12A variant of the PPARG2 gene (601487.0002) on diabetes risk given by
the UCP2 SNP. After stratifying for the PPARG2 polymorphism, the
increased risk conferred by the UCP2 G/G genotype was still evident
among P12/P12 homozygous subjects (n = 801; OR = 1.38 ; 95% CI,
1.04-1.83), but seemed to disappear among carriers of the A12 allele (n
= 137; OR = 0.87; 95% CI, 0.40-1.91).

612352	TITLE *612352 STAM-BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE 1; STAMBPL1
;;AMSH-LIKE PROTEIN; AMSHLP;;
AMSH-FAMILY PROTEIN; AMSHFP;;
KIAA1373
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned STAMBPL1, which they designated
KIAA1373. The cDNA contains several repetitive elements in its 3-prime
end, and the deduced 463-amino acid protein shares significant
similarity with AMSH (STAMBP; 606247). RT-PCR ELISA revealed highest
STAMBPL1 expression in testis and ovary, with much lower expression in
whole adult brain. Among specific adult brain regions, STAMBPL1 was
detected in cerebellum only.

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to AMSH, followed by
screening an activated peripheral blood leukocyte cDNA library, Kikuchi
et al. (2003) cloned STAMBPL1, which they called AMSHLP. The deduced
436-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 49.8 kD.
AMSHLP contains a putative nuclear localization signal, a sequence
similar to an SH3-binding motif, and an MPN (MPR, see 154540; PAD1,
607173; N-terminal) domain that includes a JAMM (JAB1, 604850/MPN domain
metalloenzyme) motif. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.5-kb AMSHLP
transcript in all human tissues examined, with highest expression in
testis. Minor transcripts of 5.3 and 5.5 kb were expressed in spleen and
weakly in thymus and heart. Western blot analysis detected a 50-kD
protein in all mouse and human cell lines examined. In transfected COS-7
cells, fluorescence-tagged AMSHLP was expressed diffusely in the
cytoplasm and in a punctate pattern surrounding the nuclear membrane.

Kitajima et al. (2003) cloned 2 splice variants of mouse Stambpl1, which
they called Amshfp-alpha and Amshfp-beta. Full-length Amshfp-alpha
contains 437 amino acids, while Amshfp-beta lacks the 166 N-terminal
amino acids present in Amshfp-alpha. Northern blot analysis detected
highest Amshfp-alpha expression in thymus, weaker expression in brain,
lung, spleen, stomach, intestine, colon, and ovary, and none in other
mouse tissues examined. Amshfp-beta was detected in testis only. In situ
hybridization showed that Amshfp-beta expression in adult mouse testis
was restricted to the haploid stage of testicular germ cells. No
Amshfp-beta expression was detected in juvenile or infertile mouse
testis.

GENE FUNCTION

Kikuchi et al. (2003) found that both the nuclear localization signal
and the MPN domain of AMSHLP are required for its nuclear localization.
Like AMSH, AMSHLP enhanced the activity of a MYC (190080) reporter gene
in response to IL2 (147680) stimulation in transfected mouse pre-B
cells. However, unlike AMSH, AMSHLP was unable to bind STAM family (see
601899) proteins.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Sato et al. (2008) reported the crystal structure of human AMSHLP DUB
(deubiquitinating enzyme) domain alone and in complex with a
lys63-linked diubiquitin at 1.2-angstrom and 1.6-angstrom resolutions,
respectively. The AMSHLP DUB domain consists of a zinc ion-coordinating
catalytic core and 2 characteristic insertions, Ins1 and Ins2. The
distal ubiquitin interacts with Ins1 and the core, whereas the proximal
ubiquitin interacts with Ins2 and the core. The core and Ins1 form a
catalytic groove that accommodates the lys63 side chain of the proximal
ubiquitin and the isopeptide-linked carboxy-terminal tail of the distal
ubiquitin.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the STAMBPL1
gene to chromosome 10. Kikuchi et al. (2003) mapped the STAMBPL1 gene to
chromosome 10q23 by genomic sequence analysis.

Kitajima et al. (2003) mapped the mouse Stambpl1 gene to chromosome
19C1.

614760	TITLE *614760 PQ LOOP REPEAT-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; PQLC2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching a human database for sequences similar to the C. elegans
lysosomal amino acid transporter Laat1, followed by PCR of a HEK293 cDNA
library, Liu et al. (2012) cloned PQLC2. The deduced protein contains
291 amino acids. Both PQLC2 and Laat1 contain 7 transmembrane domains, 2
PQ loop repeats characteristic of lysosomal cystine transporters, and a
putative lysosomal sorting motif near the C terminus. PQLC2 localized to
lysosomes in transfected COS-7 cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Cystinosis (219800) is caused by intralysosomal accumulation of free
cystine due to a mutation in the lysosomal cystine transporter (CTNS;
606272). The aminothiol cysteamine, used to treat cystinosis, converts
lysosomal cystine to cysteine and the mixed disulfide of
cysteine-cysteamine, which is believed to be exported from lysosomes by
a lysine-cationic amino acid transporter. Using transfected human cell
lines and mutant worms, Liu et al. (2012) found that human PQLC2 and C.
elegans Laat1 functioned as the necessary lysine-cationic amino acid
transporter. Knockout of Laat1 in worms caused elevated lysosomal lysine
and arginine content, although cystine content was normal. Laat1-Ctns
double mutation resulted in additional cystine accumulation that was
resistant to cysteamine treatment. In transfection experiments with
COS-7 cells, deletion of the lysosomal sorting motif of PQLC2 or Laat1
resulted in proteins that were redirected to the plasma membrane. The
deletion also increased cellular lysine and arginine uptake, which was
abolished when the invariant pro in the first PQ loop was mutated to leu
in PQLC2 or Laat1.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the PQLC2 gene to chromosome 1p36.13 based on an
alignment of the PQLC2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK000327) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

601572	TITLE *601572 CAPPING PROTEIN, BETA; CAPZB
;;CAP PROTEIN, ACTIN, BETA; CAPPB
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

CapZ was identified in chicken as an actin-binding protein composed of
alpha (see 601580) and beta subunits. From a human retina cDNA library,
Barron-Casella et al. (1995) isolated cDNAs homologous for the beta
subunit of chicken CapZ.

MAPPING

Barron-Casella et al. (1995) mapped the CAPZB gene to chromosome 1p36.1
by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

HISTORY

In the course of mapping 39 ESTs on chromosome 6p24-p23, Olavesen et al.
(1997) concluded that CAPZB is located in that region flanked by EDN1
(131240) on the centromeric side and TFAP2 (107580) on the telomeric
side. However, Cooper (1999) stated that a 'simple clerical error'
occurred at the outset of this project; the EST in question does not
share sequence similarity with the CAPZB gene and, therefore, the
mapping of the CAPZB gene to chromosome 6p24-p23 is incorrect.

606855	TITLE *606855 RELAXIN 3; RLN3
;;H3;;
RXN3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database searching for sequences showing homology to relaxins (see
RLN1, 179370), Bathgate et al. (2002) identified RLN3, which they
designated H3, and assembled a complete coding sequence from multiple
genomic fragments. They also identified the mouse Rln3 gene by database
analysis through its homology with the human sequence. The human and
mouse genes encode deduced proteins of 142 and 141 amino acids,
respectively. Both proteins contain a putative prohormone sequence
incorporating the classic 2-chain, 3-cysteine-bonded structure of the
relaxin/insulin family, and the RXXXRXX(I/V) motif in the B chain
essential for relaxin receptor binding. Both have a predicted 27-amino
acid B chain, a 66-amino acid C-peptide, and a 24-amino acid A chain.
Northern blot analysis of human tissues detected weak signals in spleen,
thymus, peripheral blood leukocytes, lymph node, and testis. Northern
blot analysis of mouse tissues detected a 1.2-kb transcript only in
brain. RT-PCR revealed high expression of relaxin in mouse brain, ovary,
and testis, moderate expression in thymus, lung, and spleen, very low
expression in heart and liver, and no expression in kidney, skin, and
gut. In situ hybridization of mouse brain showed expression localized to
the pons/medulla, with highest levels in the pars ventromedialis of the
dorsal tegmental nucleus. Rln3 was also expressed at far lower levels in
the hippocampus and olfactory regions.

Using RT-PCR, Liu et al. (2003) detected RLN3 expression only in brain
and testis. In situ hybridization revealed limited Rln3 expression in
rat brain, with highest levels in periaqueductal gray, nucleus incertus,
and central gray regions in the brainstem.

GENE FUNCTION

Bathgate et al. (2002) found that synthetic RLN3 produced a
dose-dependent increase in cAMP production in a relaxin
receptor-expressing human monocytic cell line.

Liu et al. (2003) found that endogenous rat or porcine brain Rln3
stimulated GPCR135 (RLN3R1; 609445)-transfected Chinese hamster ovary
cell membranes to bind a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog. Using FLAG-tagged
human RLN3 secreted from transfected COS-7 cells, they confirmed that
RLN3 is a ligand for GPCR135. Radiolabeled RLN3 saturably bound GPCR135
in a monophasic manner with high affinity. Labeled RLN3 was displaced
from GPCR135 by unlabeled RLN3 or by the RLN3 beta chain, but not by any
other insulin/relaxin family members. RLN3 did not stimulate cAMP
accumulation, but it inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in
GPCR135-expressing cells in a dose-dependent manner. Liu et al. (2003)
concluded that RLN3 is a ligand for GPCR135.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bathgate et al. (2002) determined that the RLN3 gene contains 2 exons.

MAPPING

Bathgate et al. (2002) stated that the human RLN3 gene maps to
chromosome 19p13.3 and the mouse homolog to chromosome 8C2.

;;LECTIN, C-TYPE, SUPERFAMILY MEMBER 6; CLECSF6;;
DENDRITIC CELL IMMUNORECEPTOR; DCIR;;
LECTIN-LIKE IMMUNORECEPTOR; LLIR
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Dendritic cells (DCs) are sentinel leukocytes that take up and present
carbohydrate-bearing antigens by means of specialized surface receptors.
Type I calcium-dependent (C-type) lectin receptors, including macrophage
mannose receptor (MMR, or MRC1; 153618) and DEC205 (LY75; 604524),
possess multiple calcium-dependent extracellular carbohydrate
recognition domains (CRDs) in their N termini. A second family of C-type
lectins are type II proteins that have only 1 CRD at the C-terminal end,
such as the asialoglycoprotein receptors (ASPGRs; see 108360). By
searching an EST database for sequences in DC libraries with a motif
shared by the ASPGRs as the probe, Bates et al. (1999) identified a cDNA
encoding CLEC4A, which they called DCIR. The deduced 237-amino acid DCIR
transmembrane protein, which is 54% identical and 65% homologous to the
mouse sequence, lacks a signal sequence but contains a single CRD, a
double-cysteine motif at the start of the lectin domain, a potential
N-glycosylation site, and a 49-amino acid intracellular immunoreceptor
tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM). Northern blot analysis detected
strongest expression of 1.3- and 1.5-kb DCIR transcripts in peripheral
blood leukocytes, with moderate expression in spleen, lymph node, and
bone marrow, and lower expression in thymus, spinal cord, and trachea;
expression was not detected in any other tissues tested. RT-PCR analysis
showed that expression of DCIR was restricted to myelomonocytic cells
and nonactivated B cells, but not other circulating lymphocytes.
Immunohistologic analysis demonstrated that DCIR was expressed in tonsil
between the epithelium and around B-cell follicles, but not in germinal
centers.

Using subtractive cloning of a dendritic cell cDNA library and RACE,
Huang et al. (2001) obtained a cDNA encoding CLEC4A, which they termed
LLIR. RT-PCR analysis identified 2 splice variants, both of which lack
the transmembrane domain but retain the CRD. Western blot analysis
showed expression of a 60-kD protein in dendritic cells, B-cell lines,
and monocytoid lines.

GENE FUNCTION

Using immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analyses, Huang et al. (2001)
showed that the ITIM of CLEC4A could recruit SHP1 (PTPN6; 176883).

Using DCIR-specific small interfering RNA and a polyclonal antibody for
the carbohydrate recognition domain of DCIR, Lambert et al. (2008)
showed that DCIR, like other C-type lectin receptors, was a ligand for
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 (see 609423) and participated in
viral capture and transmission. DCIR-mediated transmission of HIV-1 was
due to intracellular storage of intact virions and also de novo virus
production by dendritic cells.

MAPPING

Using Southern blot and radiation hybrid panel analysis, Bates et al.
(1999) mapped the single-copy DCIR gene to chromosome 12p13, near the
natural killer cell gene complex.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Hewitt et al. (1991) isolated a human gastric intrinsic factor cDNA
clone using a rat cDNA clone as a probe. Comparison of the predicted
amino acid sequences showed 80% identity between human and rat GIF.

MAPPING

By analysis of a panel of human/mouse somatic cell hybrids, Hewitt et
al. (1991) mapped the GIF gene to human chromosome 11. Southern analysis
of genomic DNA indicated the presence of a single human IF gene.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization and mouse/hamster somatic cell
hybrid analysis, Fernandes et al. (1998) mapped the Gif gene to mouse
chromosome 19. The high degree of homology of synteny between human
11q13 and mouse chromosome 19 suggests that the human GIF gene is
located at 11q13.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Andersen et al. (2010) presented the crystal structure of the complex
between GIF-cobalamin and the cubilin (CUBN; 602997)-GIF-cubilin-binding
region determined at 3.3-angstrom resolution. The structure provided
insight into how several CUB (complement C1r/C1s, Uegf, Bmp1) domains
collectively function as modular ligand-binding regions, and how 2
distant CUB domains embrace the cubilin molecule by binding the 2 GIF
domains in a calcium-dependent manner. This dual-point model provides a
probable explanation of how cubilin indirectly induces ligand-receptor
coupling. Finally, the comparison of calcium-binding CUB domains and the
low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR; 606945)-type A modules suggested
that the electrostatic pairing of a basic ligand arginine/lysine residue
with calcium-coordinating acidic aspartates/glutamates is a common theme
of calcium-dependent ligand-receptor interactions.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Gordon et al. (2004) sequenced all the exons of the GIF gene in 5
patients with intrinsic factor deficiency (IFD; 261000) and in the
parents of 4 of the patients. A single-nucleotide substitution at
position 2 of codon 5 (68A-G) in 1 or both copies of the GIF gene was
identified in all of the subjects, with additional changes observed in 2
patients. When COS-7 cells were transfected with plasmids containing
either the normal or the mutant cDNA, the secreted GIF proteins had a
similar rate of secretion and sensitivity to pepsin degradation. Three
subjects were homozygous for the missense mutation, changing codon 5
from CAG (glutamine) to CGG (arginine) (Q5R; 609342.0001). Three
subjects were homozygous for the mutation and 2 subjects were
heterozygous, 1 of whom was apparently a compound heterozygote at
positions 1 and 2 of the fifth codon. The other patient heterozygous for
position 2 had 1 heterozygous unaffected parent. Most parents were
heterozygous for this base exchange, confirming the pattern of autosomal
recessive inheritance for congenital IF deficiency. cDNA encoding GIF
was mutated at basepair g.68A-G. The apparent size, secretion rate, and
sensitivity to pepsin hydrolysis of the expressed IF were similar to
native intrinsic factor. The allelic frequency of 68A-G was 0.067 and
0.038 in 2 control populations from Germany and Spain, respectively.
Gordon et al. (2004) concluded that the Q5R variant was not the cause of
the phenotype but was associated with congenital IF deficiency in such a
way as to serve as a marker for inheritance of this disorder.

In an 11-year-old girl with severe anemia and cobalamin (Cbl)
deficiency, Yassin et al. (2004) identified a 4-base deletion in the
coding region of the GIF gene (609342.0002). The bone marrow showed
frank megaloblastic morphology, and the Schilling test indicated a
failure to absorb Cbl that was corrected by coadministration of
intrinsic factor. Pentagastrin administration induced acid secretion,
but the gastric juice lacked intrinsic factor as determined by Cbl
binding and other tests.

In 7 families previously diagnosed with Imerslund-Grasbeck syndrome
(261100) due to inconclusive results on radiocobalamin absorption tests,
but who were negative for mutations in the cubilin (CUBN; 602997) or the
AMN (605799) gene, Tanner et al. (2005) identified homozygosity for 6
different mutations in the GIF gene (609342.0002-609342.0007). Tanner et
al. (2005) proposed that rather than radiocobalamin absorption tests,
mutation analysis of the CUBN, AMN, and GIF genes may be the diagnostic
method of choice for cobalamin absorption disorders.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
INTRINSIC FACTOR DEFICIENCY, CONGENITAL, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
GIF, GLN5ARG

Gordon et al. (2004) studied 5 patients with congenital intrinsic factor
deficiency (261000) and in all found the identical variant, 68A-G, in
codon 5 of the GIF gene, changing the mature protein from glutamine to
arginine at residue 5. Three subjects were homozygous for this base
exchange and 2 were heterozygous. Since the apparent size, secretion
rate, and sensitivity to pepsin hydrolysis of the intrinsic factor
produced by mutation of the GIF gene and transfection into COS-7 cells
were similar to native GIF, Gordon et al. (2004) concluded that the
sequence aberration was not the cause of the phenotype but could serve
as a marker for inheritance of the disorder. In 2 control populations,
German and Spanish, the frequency of the change from A to G at
nucleotide 68 was 0.067 and 0.038, respectively.

Tanner et al. (2005) analyzed exon 1 of the GIF gene in a set of 176
unrelated controls and found 140 homozygotes for the 68A allele, 6
homozygotes for the 68G allele, and 30 heterozygotes, resulting in an
observed allele frequency of 0.119 for the 68G allele. They suggested
that homozygosity for the 68G polymorphism has no clinical significance
in IFD.

.0002
INTRINSIC FACTOR DEFICIENCY
GIF, 4-BP DEL, 183GAAT

In an 11-year-old girl with severe anemia and cobalamin deficiency
(261000), Yassin et al. (2004) identified a 4-bp deletion
(c183_186delGAAT) spanning positions 104 to 107 in exon 2 of the GIF
gene as the basis of inherited intrinsic factor deficiency.

In an affected member of an African (Guinea-Bissau) family with
hereditary intrinsic factor deficiency, Tanner et al. (2005) identified
homozygosity for the 183delGAAT mutation, resulting in a frameshift at
codon 61 predicted to lead to loss of function. The parents were
heterozygous for the mutation.

.0003
INTRINSIC FACTOR DEFICIENCY
GIF, IVS1DS, G-A, +1

In 2 affected members of a French family with hereditary intrinsic
factor deficiency (261000), Tanner et al. (2005) identified homozygosity
for a G-to-A transition at +1 in the donor splice site of intron 1 of
the GIF gene, predicted to lead to a loss of function. The parents were
heterozygous for the mutation.

.0004
INTRINSIC FACTOR DEFICIENCY
GIF, IVS1AS, G-A, -1

In 7 affected members of 2 Kuwaiti families with hereditary intrinsic
factor deficiency (261000), Tanner et al. (2005) identified homozygosity
for a G-A transition at -1 in the acceptor splice site of intron 1 of
the GIF gene that destroyed the consensus sequence and was predicted to
lead to loss of function. The parents were heterozygous for the
mutation.

.0005
INTRINSIC FACTOR DEFICIENCY
GIF, SER46LEU

In 4 affected members of a Turkish family with hereditary intrinsic
factor deficiency (261000), Tanner et al. (2005) identified homozygosity
for a 137C-T transition in exon 2 of the GIF gene, replacing the
conserved serine residue 46 with a leucine (S46L). The parents were
heterozygous for the mutation.

.0006
INTRINSIC FACTOR DEFICIENCY
GIF, 1-BP DEL 161A

In an affected member of a Turkish family with hereditary intrinsic
factor deficiency (261000), Tanner et al. (2005) identified homozygosity
for a 1-bp deletion (161delA) in exon 2 of the GIF gene, resulting in a
frameshift at codon 54 predicted to lead to loss of function. The
parents were heterozygous for the mutation.

.0007
INTRINSIC FACTOR DEFICIENCY
GIF, 1-BP INS, 1175T

In an affected member of a Turkish family with hereditary intrinsic
factor deficiency (261000), Tanner et al. (2005) identified homozygosity
for a 1-bp insertion (1175insT) in exon 8 of the GIF gene, resulting in
a frameshift at codon 393 predicted to lead to loss of function. The
parents were heterozygous for the mutation.

607199	TITLE *607199 INTERFERON REGULATORY FACTOR 6; IRF6
DESCRIPTION 
GENE FAMILY

Interferon regulatory factor-6 (IRF6) belongs to a family of 9
transcription factors that share a highly-conserved helix-turn-helix
DNA-binding domain and a less conserved protein-binding domain. This
domain, called SMIR (for SMAD (see 601366)-IRF-binding domain), is also
found in IRF3 (603734) and IRF7 (605047). Other interferon regulatory
factors include IRF1 (147575) on 5q, IRF2 (147576) on 4q, IRF3 on 19q,
and IRF4 (601900) on 6p. Most IRFs regulate the expression of
interferon-alpha (see 147660) and -beta (see 147640) after viral
infection.

CLONING

Kondo et al. (2002) cloned human IRF6. The deduced protein contains an
N-terminal winged-helix DNA-binding domain and a C-terminal SMIR
(Smad-interferon regulatory factor-binding) domain. RT-PCR analysis
showed that Irf6 is broadly expressed in embryonic and adult mouse
tissues. A similar expression pattern was seen in human fetal and adult
tissues. In situ hybridization of mouse embryos demonstrated that Irf6
is highly expressed in the medial edges of the paired palatal shelves
immediately before, and during, their fusion. High Irf6 expression was
also detected in hair follicles, palatal rugae, tooth germ and
thyroglossal duct, external genitalia, and in skin throughout the body.

Ben et al. (2005) determined that the human IRF6 protein contains 517
amino acids.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kondo et al. (2002) determined that the IRF6 gene contains 10 exons.
Exons 1, 2, and 10 are noncoding.

Ben et al. (2005) found strong structural conservation among human,
mouse, zebrafish and Fugu Irf6 orthologs, especially in the 7 coding
exons.

MAPPING

Kondo et al. (2002) identified the IRF6 gene within the VWS critical
region at 1q32-q41.

GENE FUNCTION

Mutation in the IRF6 gene can cause van der Woude syndrome (VWS1;
119300) and popliteal pterygium syndrome (PPS; 119500). VWS is an
autosomal dominant form of cleft lip and palate associated with lip
pits, and is the most common syndromic form of cleft lip or palate. PPS
is a disorder with a similar orofacial phenotype that also includes skin
and genital anomalies. Phenotypic overlap and linkage data had suggested
that these 2 disorders are allelic. To correlate the expression of IRF6
with the phenotypes of VWS and PPS, Kondo et al. (2002) conducted
expression analyses in mice. Studies showed high levels of Irf6 mRNA
along the medial edge of the fusing palate, tooth buds, hair follicles,
genitalia, and skin. Their observations demonstrated that
haploinsufficiency of IRF6 disrupts orofacial development and were
consistent with dominant-negative mutations disturbing development of
the skin and genitalia.

Little et al. (2009) determined the DNA sequence to which IRF6 binds and
used this sequence to analyze the effect of VWS- and PPS-associated
missense mutations (see, e.g., 607199.0004) in the DNA-binding domain of
IRF6. They showed that IRF6 functions as a cooperative transcriptional
activator and that mutations in the protein interaction domain (residues
226 to 467) of IRF6 disrupt this activity.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Van der Woude Syndrome

To identify the locus associated with van der Woude syndrome (119300),
Kondo et al. (2002) did a direct sequence analysis of genes and
presumptive transcripts in the 350-kb critical region on 1q identified
by linkage mapping. This approach was confounded by SNPs that occurred
about once every 1,900 basepairs. To distinguish between putative
disease-causing mutations and SNPs, they studied a pair of monozygotic
twins who were discordant for the VWS phenotype and had unaffected
parents. Monozygotic status was confirmed by showing complete
concordance of genotype at 20 microsatellite loci. The authors concluded
that the only sequence difference between the twins resulted from a
somatic mutation in the affected twin. Kondo et al. (2002) found a
nonsense mutation in IRF6 in the affected twin (607199.0001).
Subsequently, they identified mutations in IRF6 in 45 additional
unrelated families affected with VWS.

Ghassibe et al. (2004) screened the IRF6 gene in 6 families with VWS and
identified 6 heterozygous missense mutations, respectively, all
affecting either the DNA-binding or the protein-binding domain. In a
4-generation VWS family in which affected individuals carried an L22P
mutation (607199.0014), 2 of the patients displayed additional features:
1 had finger syndactyly, and the other had toe syndactyly and oral
synechiae. Ghassibe et al. (2004) stated that because syndactyly and
synechiae are major signs for PPS, these 2 patients were considered to
have PPS, whereas the 6 other affected family members were classified as
VWS, thus demonstrating that a single mutation could be responsible for
both syndromes.

In a 16-year-old girl with a heart-shaped mass on her inner lower lip
but no pits, Yeetong et al. (2009) identified heterozygosity for a
nonsense mutation in the IRF6 gene (Q49X; 607199.0017).

- Popliteal Pterygium Syndrome

In affected members of 5 unrelated families with popliteal pterygium
syndrome (PPS; 119500), Kondo et al. (2002) identified heterozygosity
for an arg84-to-cys (R84C; 607199.0004) mutation in the IRF6 gene. In 2
other PPS families, they identified an arg84-to-his (R84H; 607199.0005)
substitution.

Matsuzawa et al. (2010) identified a heterozygous R84L mutation
(607199.0015) in a Japanese family with variable expression of
popliteal-pterygium syndrome. Mutations in the same codon, R84C and
R84H, have been reported in other patients with PPS (Kondo et al.,
2002), suggesting a hotspot for recurrent mutations.

- Van der Woude Syndrome-Popliteal Pterygium Syndrome Spectrum

De Medeiros et al. (2008) described a patient, conceived by in vitro
fertilization, with unilateral cleft lip and palate, ankyloblepharon,
paramedian lip pits, unilateral renal aplasia, and a coronal
hypospadias, with a novel heterozygous mutation (607199.0013) in the
IRF6 gene. The authors considered the patient to have a VWS-PPS spectrum
disorder. They were uncertain whether renal aplasia was related to the
mutation or the method of fertilization.

- Orofacial Cleft 6

Zucchero et al. (2004) found overtransmission of the ancestral allele of
the V274I polymorphism (dbSNP rs2235371), originally identified by Kondo
et al. (2002), to patients with nonsyndromic cleft lip and palate (OFC6;
608864) who were Asian but did not find it in groups of European
descent. Zucchero et al. (2004) noted that their findings suggested that
the V allele itself was not causal.

Rahimov et al. (2008) used multispecies sequence comparison to identify
a common SNP (dbSNP rs642961, G-A) in an IRF6 enhancer located in the
intergenic region between the start sites of the oppositely transcribed
IRF6 and C1ORF107 genes (genome coordinate 208,055,893; build 36.3) They
found that the A allele was significantly overtransmitted (p = 1 x
10(-11)) in families with nonsyndromic cleft lip/palate (OFC6; 608864),
particularly in those with cleft lip only. EMSA and CHIP assays
demonstrated that the risk allele disrupts the binding site of
transcription factor AP-2-alpha (TFAP2A; 107580), and expression
analysis in the mouse localized the enhancer activity to craniofacial
and limb structures. In luciferase reported assays in a human foreskin
keratinocyte cell line, the risk haplotype consistently increased the
luciferase expression more than the nonassociated haplotypes did, but
the difference did not reach statistical significance. Rahimov et al.
(2008) concluded that IRF6 and TFAP2A are in the same developmental
pathway and that this high frequency variant in a regulatory element
contributes substantially to a common, complex disorder.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Clefts of the lip with or without cleft palate and isolated cleft palate
are developmentally and genetically distinct (see 119520 and 119540,
respectively), yet VWS is a single-gene disorder that encompasses both
clefting phenotypes. To verify this point, Kondo et al. (2002) analyzed
22 pedigrees that had a single mutation in IRF6 and individuals with
both phenotypes. Genotype analysis of 1 family demonstrated that
affected individuals, regardless of their phenotype, shared the 18-bp
deletion (607199.0002) that occurred in the proband. They observed
similar results in the other families and concluded that a single
mutation in IRF6 can cause both types of clefting. Protein-truncation
mutations were significantly more common in VWS than in PPS (P = 0.004).
The lone exception was a nonsense mutation present in 1 family, glu393
to ter (607199.0003), which may be a dominant-negative mutation.

Kondo et al. (2002) found that missense mutations that cause VWS were
almost evenly divided between the DNA-binding domain and the
protein-binding domain, whereas most missense mutations that cause PPS
were found in the DNA-binding domain. Comparison of the positions of PPS
mutations with the crystal structure of the IRF1 DNA-binding domain
showed that every amino acid residue that was mutant in individuals with
PPS directly contacts the DNA, whereas only 1 of 7 of the residues
mutant in individuals with VWS contacts the DNA. Most notably, Kondo et
al. (2002) observed missense mutations involving the arg84 codon in 7
unrelated PPS families. The arg84 residue is comparable to the arg82
residue of IRF1. Variation in the phenotypic effects of mutations in the
IRF6 gene causing VWS and PPS suggested the operation of stochastic
factors or modifier genes influencing IRF6 function. Three sorts of
variation were observed. Thirty-two families had multiple combinations
of orofacial anomalies, 22 families had mixed clefting phenotypes
(individuals with cleft lip and individuals with cleft palate only in
the same family), and 4 families affected with PPS included individuals
who exhibited orofacial (VWS) features exclusively. Kondo et al. (2002)
identified a sequence variant, val274 to ile, occurring within an
absolutely conserved residue within the SMIR domain. This variant is
common in unaffected populations (3% in European-descended and 22% in
Asian populations) and was considered by them an attractive candidate
for a modifier of VWS, PPS, and other orofacial clefting disorders.

ANIMAL MODEL

The epidermis is a highly organized structure, the integrity of which is
central to the protection of an organism. Development and subsequent
maintenance of this tissue depends critically on the intricate balance
between proliferation and differentiation of a resident stem cell
population. Richardson et al. (2006) undertook a study of the signals
controlling the proliferation-differentiation switch in vivo. They
showed that mice carrying a homozygous missense mutation in Irf6, the
homolog of the gene mutated in the human congenital disorders van der
Woude syndrome and popliteal pterygium syndrome, have a
hyperproliferative epidermis that fails to undergo terminal
differentiation, resulting in soft tissue fusions. They further
demonstrated that mice compound heterozygous for mutations in Irf6 and
the gene encoding the cell cycle regulator protein stratifin (SFN;
601290) show similar defects of keratinizing epithelia. The results
indicated that Irf6 is a key determinant of the keratinocyte
proliferation-differentiation switch and that Irf6 and Sfn interact
genetically in this process.

Ingraham et al. (2006) obtained Irf6-null mice at the expected mendelian
ratio. At embryonic day 17.5, Irf6-null mice had taut, shiny skin,
lacked external ears, and had snouts and jaws shorter and more rounded
than their wildtype littermates. Irf6-null embryos also had short
forelimbs that lacked visible digits and a single caudal projection that
lacked visible hindlimbs and tail. Histologic and gene expression
analyses showed that the primary defect was in keratinocyte
differentiation and proliferation. Ingraham et al. (2006) found that
abnormalities of epithelial differentiation that resulted in cleft
palate were a consequence of adhesion between the palatal shelves and
the tongue in both Irf6-null and homozygous missense mice.

Richardson et al. (2009) showed that Irf6/Jag2 (602570) doubly
heterozygous mice displayed a fully penetrant intraoral epithelial
adhesions, resulting in cleft palate. There was no evidence of direct
interaction between Irf6 and Jag2, suggesting that the mechanism
underlying the genetic interaction between Irf6 and Jag2 is the
consequence of their combined effects on periderm formation,
maintenance, and function. Notch1 (190198) and p63 (603273) expression
patterns in Irf6/Jag2 doubly heterozygous mouse embryos suggested that
Irf6 affects Jag2-Notch1 signaling during periderm maintenance.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
VAN DER WOUDE SYNDROME 1
IRF6, GLU92TER

In the affected twin of a pair of monozygotic twins who were discordant
for van der Woude syndrome (VWS1; 119300), Kondo et al. (2002) found a
nonsense mutation in exon 4 of the IRF6 gene that was absent in both
parents and the unaffected twin: glu92 to ter (E92X).

.0002
VAN DER WOUDE SYNDROME 1
IRF6, 18-BP DEL/1-BP INS

In affected members of a family with van der Woude syndrome (119300),
Kondo et al. (2002) identified heterozygosity for an 18-bp deletion and
insertion of a single adenine occurring after nucleotide 870 of the IRF6
gene. Some affected members had cleft of the lip with cleft palate,
others had cleft of the lip without cleft palate, and yet others had
isolated cleft plate; regardless of the phenotype, all shared the 18-bp
deletion found in the proband.

.0003
POPLITEAL PTERYGIUM SYNDROME
IRF6, GLN393TER

Kondo et al. (2002) found that protein-truncation mutations of the IRF6
gene were significantly more common in van der Woude syndrome (VWS;
119300) than in popliteal pterygium syndrome (PPS; 119500) (P = 0.004).
The lone exception to this relationship was a nonsense mutation
introducing a stop codon in place of a glutamine codon at position 393
(Q393X), which may be a dominant-negative mutation, found in affected
members of a PPS family.

.0004
POPLITEAL PTERYGIUM SYNDROME
IRF6, ARG84CYS

In affected members of 5 unrelated families with popliteal pterygium
syndrome (119500), Kondo et al. (2002) identified heterozygosity for a
250C-T transition in the IRF6 gene resulting in an arg84-to-cys (R84C)
change in the protein. In affected members of 2 other PPS families,
arg84 was changed to a different amino acid (607199.0005).

.0005
POPLITEAL PTERYGIUM SYNDROME
IRF6, ARG84HIS

In affected members of 2 unrelated families with PPS (119500), Kondo et
al. (2002) found an arg84-to-his (R84H) missense mutation in the IRF6
gene. The arg84 residue, affected in the arg84-to-cys (607199.0004) and
arg84-to-his missense mutations, is 1 of 4 residues that make critical
contacts with the core sequence, GAAA, and is essential for the DNA
binding function of IRF6.

.0006
VAN DER WOUDE SYNDROME 1
IRF6, ALA2VAL

Wang et al. (2003) screened 4 Chinese families with van der Woude
syndrome (119300) in 9 exons and their flanking splice junctions of the
IRF6 gene by direct sequencing. They identified 3 missense mutations,
including ala2-to-val (A2V), resulting from a 268C-T nucleotide change.
The A2V mutation had been reported previously in an American family by
Kondo et al. (2002).

.0007
VAN DER WOUDE SYNDROME 1
IRF6, ARG6CYS

An arg6-to-cys (R6C) substitution in the IRF6 gene (279C-T in exon 3)
was found by Wang et al. (2003) in a Chinese family with van der Woude
syndrome (119300).

.0008
VAN DER WOUDE SYNDROME 1
IRF6, TRP379TER

In a Chinese family with van der Woude syndrome (119300), Wang et al.
(2003) found a nonsense mutation in the IRF6 gene: a TGG-to-TGA
(1400G-A) transition at codon 379 of exon 8, introducing a premature
stop codon in place of a tryptophan residue (W379X).

.0009
VAN DER WOUDE SYNDROME 1
IRF6, ARG400TRP

In a Chinese family with van der Woude syndrome (119300), Wang et al.
(2003) found that affected members were carrying a missense mutation in
the IRF6 gene: a 1461C-T transition in exon 9, predicting a tryptophan
substitution for a highly conserved arginine at codon 400 (R400W).

.0010
VAN DER WOUDE SYNDROME 1
IRF6, 17-BP DEL

In a Japanese family with van der Woude syndrome (119300), Kayano et al.
(2003) found a 17-kb deletion in the IRF6 gene. On initial sequencing no
base change was found, but a deletion involving exons 4-9 was suggested
by multiplex PCR analysis. Further analyses revealed a heterozygous
17,162-bp deletion involving exons 4-9. Kayano et al. (2003) suggested
that since IRF6 mutations in a significant portion of VWS patients
remain undetected by conventional sequencing analysis, it may be
important to search for a large deletion in such patients.

.0011
VAN DER WOUDE SYNDROME 1
IRF6, ARG45GLN

In a Japanese family with van der Woude syndrome (119300), Kayano et al.
(2003) found a G-to-A substitution at nucleotide 134 in exon 3 of the
IRF6 gene that resulted in an arg45-to-gln (R45Q) amino acid change.

.0012
VAN DER WOUDE SYNDROME 1
IRF6, PRO396SER

In a Japanese family with van der Woude syndrome (119300), Kayano et al.
(2003) found a C-to-T substitution at nucleotide 1186 in exon 9 of the
IRF6 gene that resulted in a pro396-to-ser (P396S) amino acid change.

VAN DER WOUDE SYNDROME 1
POPLITEAL PTERYGIUM SYNDROME, INCLUDED
IRF6, ARG339ILE

In a patient with overlapping features of van der Woude syndrome
(119300) and popliteal pterygium syndrome (119500) (unilateral cleft lip
and palate, ankyloblepharon, paramedian lip pits) as well as unilateral
renal aplasia and coronal hypospadias, de Medeiros et al. (2008)
identified heterozygosity for a 1016G-T transversion in the IRF6 gene,
resulting in an arg339-to-ile (R339I) substitution. The mutation was not
found in 60 unrelated control individuals. The patient and his brother,
who had hypospadias and nephrocalcinosis but no IRF6 mutation, were both
conceived by in vitro fertilization. De Medeiros et al. (2008) suggested
that the hypospadias and renal aplasia may have been due to the method
of fertilization rather than the IRF6 mutation. They noted that a lethal
PPS syndrome (263650) has renal aplasia as a feature.

VAN DER WOUDE SYNDROME 1
POPLITEAL PTERYGIUM SYNDROME, INCLUDED
IRF6, LEU22PRO

In affected individuals from a 4-generation family with van der Woude
syndrome (VWS1; 119300), Ghassibe et al. (2004) identified
heterozygosity for a 65T-C transition in exon 3 of the IRF6 gene,
resulting in a leu22-to-pro (L22P) substitution in the DNA-binding
domain. In addition to lip pits and clefting, 2 of the patients also had
syndactyly and synechiae, major signs for popliteal-pterygium syndrome
(PPS; 119500). Ghassibe et al. (2004) stated that these 2 patients were
considered to have PPS, whereas the 6 other affected family members were
classified as VWS, thus demonstrating that a single mutation could be
responsible for both syndromes.

.0015
POPLITEAL PTERYGIUM SYNDROME
IRF6, ARG84LEU

In a Japanese boy with popliteal-pterygium syndrome (119500), Matsuzawa
et al. (2010) identified a heterozygous 251G-T transversion in exon 4 of
the IRF6 gene, resulting in an arg84-to-leu (R84L) substitution in a
critical site for DNA binding. The boy had lip pits, bilateral cleft lip
and palate, syngnathia, syndactyly, popliteal webbing, and atrophic
testes. His father, who also carried the mutation, had bilateral cleft
lip and palate only. Family history revealed a paternal grandfather and
aunt with bifid uvula and cleft palate. Thus, variable expressivity was
clinically evident in this family. The mutation was not detected in the
mother or in 90 healthy Japanese controls. The R84C (607199.0004) and
R84H (607199.0005) mutations in the same codon were previously reported
by Kondo et al. (2002) in other patients with PPS, suggesting a hotspot
for recurrent mutations.

.0016
POPLITEAL PTERYGIUM SYNDROME
IRF6, SER424LEU

In a Japanese boy and his mother with PPS (119500), Matsuzawa et al.
(2010) identified a heterozygous 1271C-T transition in exon 9 of the
IRF6 gene, resulting in a ser424-to-leu (S424L) substitution. The
mutation was not found in 200 Japanese controls. In vitro functional
expression studies showed that the mutant protein had 6% residual
activity, consistent with a loss of function. The boy had cleft palate,
syngnathia, unclear scrotum, syndactyly, and mild popliteal webbing,
whereas his mother had cleft lip and palate, syngnathia, syndactyly, and
hypoplasia of the labia majora.

.0017
VAN DER WOUDE SYNDROME 1
IRF6, GLN49TER

In a 16-year-old girl with a heart-shaped mass on her inner lower lip
(VWS1; 119300) but no pits, oral clefts, or hypodontia, Yeetong et al.
(2009) identified heterozygosity for a 145C-T transition in exon 3 of
the IRF6 gene, resulting in a gln49-to-ter (Q49X) substitution in the
highly conserved DNA-binding domain. Her mother and other relatives were
reported to have similar findings, but were unavailable for evaluation.

;;BRAIN AND MUSCLE ARNT-LIKE PROTEIN 2; BMAL2;;
CYCLE-LIKE FACTOR; CLIF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ARNTL2 is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)/PAS domain transcription
factor (Maemura et al., 2000).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to BMAL1 (ARNTL;
602550), followed by PCR of a fetal brain cDNA library and RACE of an
adult brain cDNA library, Ikeda et al. (2000) cloned ARNTL2, which they
called BMAL2. The deduced 551-amino acid protein has an N-terminal bHLH
domain, followed by PASA and PASB domains and a long C-terminal
sequence. It has 2 putative nuclear localization signals near its N
terminus. BMAL2 shares 52% amino acid identity with zebrafish Bmal2 and
49% identity with human BMAL1. Northern blot analysis detected BMAL2
transcripts of 7.0 and 8.0 kb in adult liver and fetal brain. A 2.2-kb
BMAL2 transcript was also detected in adult liver. No expression was
detected in adult heart, brain, pancreas, placenta, and lung and fetal
lung, liver, and kidney. Fluorescence-tagged BMAL2 was expressed
predominantly in the nucleus of transfected HEK293 cells.

Using EPAS1 (603349) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human
umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) cDNA library, Maemura et al.
(2000) cloned ARNTL2, which they called CLIF. The deduced 602-amino acid
protein contains a bHLH/PAS domain and shares 44.1% identity with
Drosophila Cycle and 44.9% identity with human BMAL1. It differs from
the BMAL2 protein reported by Ikeda et al. (2000) at its N terminus.
Northern blot analysis detected widespread and variable expression of
CLIF transcripts of 8, 6, 2.4, and 2.2 kb. Highest CLIF expression was
detected in brain and placenta. In situ hybridization revealed
expression of CLIF transcripts in endothelial cells of human heart,
lung, and kidney and in endothelial cells and neurons of brain.

GENE FUNCTION

By deletion analysis, Ikeda et al. (2000) found that the N-terminal
basic region of BMAL2 was required for nuclear localization.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of HUVEC cDNA, Maemura et al. (2000) found
that CLIF interacted with EPAS1 and CLOCK (601851), the major regulator
of circadian rhythm. Mobility shift assays and mutation analysis showed
that CLIF formed a heterodimer with CLOCK and bound to the E-box of the
PER1 (602260) promoter. Coexpression of CLIF with CLOCK in HUVECs
resulted in elevated CLOCK-dependent PAI1 (SERPINE1; 173360) expression,
and mutation of the E-boxes within the PAI1 promoter abrogated binding
by CLIF/CLOCK. PER2 (603426) and CRY1 (601933) inhibited
CLIF/CLOCK-dependent transactivation of the PAI1 promoter.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ikeda et al. (2000) determined that the ARNTL2 gene contains 14 coding
exons.

MAPPING

Using FISH, Ikeda et al. (2000) mapped the ARNTL2 gene to chromosome
12p12.2-p11.2.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The PTEN gene encodes a ubiquitously expressed tumor suppressor
dual-specificity phosphatase that antagonizes the PI3K signaling pathway
through its lipid phosphatase activity and negatively regulates the MAPK
pathway through its protein phosphatase activity (summary by Pezzolesi
et al., 2007).

CLONING

As tumors progress to more advanced stages, they acquire an increasing
number of genetic alterations. Li et al. (1997) noted that one
alteration that occurs at high frequency in a variety of human tumors is
loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 10q23. Although rarely seen in low-grade
glial tumors and early-stage prostate cancers, LOH at 10q23 occurs in
approximately 70% of glioblastomas (the most advanced form of glial
tumor) and approximately 60% of advanced prostate cancers. This pattern
of LOH and the finding that wildtype chromosome 10 suppresses the
tumorigenicity of glioblastoma cells in mice suggested to Li et al.
(1997) that 10q23 encodes a tumor suppressor gene. By mapping of
homozygous deletions on 10q23, they isolated a candidate tumor
suppressor gene that they called PTEN for 'phosphatase and tensin
homolog deleted on chromosome ten.' Sequence analysis of the predicted
403-amino acid open reading frame (ORF) revealed a protein tyrosine
phosphatase domain and a large region of homology (approximately 175
amino acids) to chicken tensin (600076; a protein that interacts with
actin filaments at focal adhesions) and bovine auxilin. In preliminary
screens, Li et al. (1997) detected mutations of PTEN in 31% (13 of 42)
of glioblastoma cell lines and xenografts, 100% (4 of 4) of prostate
cancer cell lines, 6% (4 of 65) of breast cancer cell lines and
xenografts, and 17% (3 of 18) of primary glioblastomas. The homologies
displayed by the structure of PTEN suggested to the investigators that
it may suppress tumor cell growth by antagonizing protein tyrosine
kinases and may regulate tumor cell invasion and metastasis through
interactions at focal adhesions.

By exon trapping, the same gene was independently isolated by Steck et
al. (1997), who designated it MMAC1 (mutated in multiple advanced
cancers-1). They began their search for the gene from deletions
involving 10q23-q24, which occur in the majority of cases of human
glioblastoma multiformes. Homozygous deletions in 4 glioma cells lines
further refined the location. The MMAC1 gene spans these deletions and
encodes a widely expressed 5.5-kb mRNA with a 403-amino acid ORF. The
predicted MMAC1 protein contains sequence motifs with significant
homology to the catalytic domain of protein phosphatases and to the
cytoskeletal proteins tensin and auxilin. MMAC1 coding-region mutations
were observed in a number of glioma, prostate, kidney, and breast
carcinoma cell lines or tumor specimens. Steck et al. (1997) also cloned
mouse and dog homologs of MMAC1.

Using RT-PCR, Sharrard and Maitland (2000) cloned full-length PTEN and 2
transcripts encoding C-terminally truncated proteins of 345 and 171
amino acids, respectively. All 3 transcripts were expressed in normal
lymphocytes and in normal prostatic epithelium cell lines. Glioblastoma
and prostate cancer cell lines showed lower and more variable
expression.

By comparative genomic analysis in human, mouse, and rat, Pezzolesi et
al. (2007) identified a highly conserved sequence upstream of the PTEN
promoter with 80% sequence identity. This region contained a canonic
E-box sequence (CACGTG) located at position -2181 to -2176,
approximately 800 bp upstream of the PTEN core promoter and more than
1.1 kb upstream of its minimal promoter region (located at -958 to
-821). In vitro assays suggested that this motif is recognized by
members of the basic region-helix-loop-helix-leucine-zipper (bHLH-LZ)
transcription factor family, USF1 (191523) and USF2 (600390). Reporter
assays showed that the E-box sequence is involved in mediating PTEN
transcriptional activation. Germline deletions involving this region
were found in 4 of 30 patients with Cowden syndrome, suggesting that
alterations at cis-regulatory elements can contribute to disease
pathogenesis.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Lee et al. (1999) described the 2.1-angstrom crystal structure of human
PTEN bound to L(+)-tartrate. The PTEN structure reveals a phosphatase
domain that is similar to protein phosphatases but also has an enlarged
active site important for the accommodation of the phosphoinositide
substrate. The structure also reveals that PTEN has a C2 domain. The
PTEN C2 domain bound phospholipid membranes in vitro, and mutation of
basic residues that could mediate this reduced the membrane affinity of
PTEN and its ability to suppress the growth of glioblastoma tumor cells.
The phosphatase and C2 domains associate across an extensive interface,
suggesting that the C2 domain may serve to productively position the
catalytic domain on the membrane.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sharrard and Maitland (2000) showed the PTEN gene contains 9 exons plus
a variable exon 5b that is skipped in the major PTEN transcript. The
3-prime end of exon 8 is subject to alternative splicing.

MAPPING

Steck et al. (1997) mapped the PTEN gene to chromosome 10q23.3. Hansen
and Justice (1998) mapped the Pten gene to mouse chromosome 19.

- Pseudogene

For information of a processed pseudogene of PTEN located on chromosome
9p13.3, see 613531.

GENE FUNCTION

In S. cerevisiae, the cdc14 gene is essential for cell cycle
progression. Analysis of the cdc14 point of action suggests that the
protein acts in late nuclear division, and may play a role in
preparation for DNA replication during the subsequent cell cycle. Li et
al. (1997) identified PTEN, CDC14A (603504), and CDC14B (603505) as
human cdc14 homologs. However, sequence analysis revealed that PTEN is
more closely related to a different yeast open reading frame, YNL128W.
Plasmids expressing PTEN failed to complement a cdc14 mutant yeast
strain. Recombinant PTEN exhibited the kinetic properties of
dual-specific phosphatases (see 602038) in vitro.

Li and Sun (1998) showed that PTEN expression potently suppressed the
growth and tumorigenicity of human glioblastoma cells. The growth
suppression activity of PTEN was mediated by its ability to block cell
cycle progression in the G1 phase. The studies suggested that the PTEN
tumor suppressor modulates G1 cell cycle progression through negatively
regulating the PI3K (see 171834)/Akt (164730) signaling pathway, and
that 1 critical target of this signaling process is the cyclin-dependent
kinase inhibitor p27(KIP1) (600778).

Hypoxia and growth factors are critical modulators of angiogenesis. By
immunoblot analysis, Zundel et al. (2000) determined that expression of
wildtype PTEN in a glioblastoma cell line with mutant PTEN blocked
hypoxia- and IGF1 (147440)-induced AKT1 phosphorylation and kinase
activity. PTEN expression, unlike serum deprivation and hypoxia, failed
to completely inhibit DNA synthesis as measured by tritiated-thymidine
incorporation. Glioblastoma cell lines were highly resistant to
induction of apoptosis by hypoxia, serum deprivation, and irradiation
with or without PTEN expression, suggesting the presence of additional
antiapoptotic mutations in these tumors. Northern blot analysis showed
that PTEN expression blocked the expression of endogenous VEGF (192240),
COX1 (176805), PGK1 (311800), and PFK (see, e.g., 610681),
hypoxia-inducible genes implicated in angiogenesis. In contrast to AKT,
PTEN expression also completely suppressed the stabilization of HIF1A
(603348) by hypoxia. Zundel et al. (2000) proposed that loss of PTEN
contributes to tumor expansion through the deregulation of AKT activity
and HIF1-regulated gene expression.

Dahia et al. (1999) analyzed PTEN in a series of primary acute leukemias
and non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) as well as in cell lines. The majority
of cell lines studied carried PTEN abnormalities: 40% carried mutations
or hemizygous deletions. One-third of cell lines had low PTEN transcript
levels, and 60% of these had low or absent PTEN protein. A smaller
number of primary hematologic malignancies, in particular NHLs, carried
PTEN mutations. PTEN and phosphorylated Akt levels were inversely
correlated in the large majority of examined samples, suggesting that
PTEN regulates phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphates and may play a
role in apoptosis.

Tamura et al. (1998) found that overexpression of PTEN inhibited cell
migration, whereas antisense PTEN enhanced migration. Integrin-mediated
cell spreading and the formation of focal adhesions were downregulated
by wildtype PTEN but not by PTEN with an inactive phosphatase domain.
PTEN interacted with the focal adhesion kinase FAK (600758) and reduced
its tyrosine phosphorylation. Overexpression of FAK partially
antagonized the effects of PTEN. Thus, PTEN phosphatase may function as
a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating cell interactions with the
extracellular matrix.

Cantley and Neel (1999) reviewed the reports indicating that PTEN
negatively controls the PI3K signaling pathway for regulation of cell
growth and survival by dephosphorylating the 3 position of
phosphoinositides.

Gimm et al. (2000) studied the temporal and spatial pattern of PTEN
expression during human development using a specific monoclonal
antibody. They observed mainly high-level PTEN expression in tissues
(e.g., skin, thyroid, and central nervous system) known to be involved
in Cowden syndrome (CS; 158350) and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome
(BRRS; 153480). In addition, expression was noted in peripheral nervous
system, autonomic nervous system, and upper gastrointestinal tract.

Mutter et al. (2000) examined PTEN expression in normal human
endometrium during response to changing physiologic levels of steroid
hormones. PTEN RNA levels, assessed by RT-PCR, increased several fold in
secretory compared to proliferative endometrium. Early in the menstrual
cycle under the dominant influence of estrogens, the proliferative
endometrium showed ubiquitous cytoplasmic and nuclear PTEN expression.
By the midsecretory phase, epithelial PTEN was exhausted, but increased
dramatically in the cytoplasm of stromal cells undergoing decidual
change. The authors concluded that stromal and epithelial compartments
contribute to the hormone-driven changes in endometrial PTEN expression
and that abnormal hormonal conditions may, in turn, disrupt normal
patterns of PTEN expression in this tissue.

Stambolic et al. (2001) investigated the human genomic PTEN locus and
identified a p53 (191170)-binding element directly upstream of the PTEN
gene. Deletion and mutation analyses showed that this element is
necessary for inducible transactivation of PTEN by p53. A
p53-independent element controlling constitutive expression of PTEN was
also identified. In contrast to p53 mutant cell lines, induction of p53
in primary and tumor cell lines with wildtype p53 increased PTEN mRNA
levels. PTEN was required for p53-mediated apoptosis in immortalized
mouse embryonic fibroblasts.

Di Cristofano and Pandolfi (2000) reviewed the multiple roles of PTEN in
tumor suppression.

Weng et al. (1999) demonstrated that overexpression of PTEN in MCF-7
breast cancer cells causes G1 arrest followed by cell death. Weng et al.
(2001) demonstrated increased PTEN-mediated cell death of MCF-7 breast
cancer cells cultured in low levels of growth factors. The caspase-9
(602234)-specific inhibitor ZVAD blocked PTEN-induced cell death without
altering the effect of PTEN on cell cycle distribution. Overexpression
of dominant-negative Akt (164730), a downstream protein kinase, induced
more cell death but had less effect on the cell cycle than
overexpression of PTEN. The authors suggested that in MCF-7 breast
cancer cells, the apoptotic cells induced by the overexpression of PTEN
are not derived from the G1-arrested cells. Further, they hypothesized
that the effect of PTEN on cell death is mediated through the PI3K/Akt
pathway, whereas PTEN-mediated cell cycle arrests depend on both
PI3K/Akt-dependent and -independent pathways.

Among 10 thyroid cancer cell lines, Weng et al. (2001) found a single
follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC; 188470) line with a hemizygous PTEN
deletion and a splice variant in the remaining allele. Four lines,
including the FTC line, expressed PTEN mRNA at low levels. Transient
expression of PTEN in 7 thyroid cancer cell lines resulted in G1 arrest
in 2 well-differentiated papillary thyroid cancer lines (PTCs), and both
G1 arrest and cell death in the remaining 5 lines, consisting of 3 FTCs,
1 poorly differentiated PTC, and 1 undifferentiated thyroid cancer. The
level of phosphorylated Akt was inversely correlated with the endogenous
level of PTEN protein, and overexpression of PTEN blocked Akt
phosphorylation in all cells analyzed. The authors suggested that
downregulation of PTEN expression at the mRNA level may play a role in
PTEN inactivation in thyroid cancer, and that PTEN may exert its
tumor-suppressive effect on thyroid cancer through the inhibition of
cell cycle progression alone, or both cell cycle progression and cell
death.

Weng et al. (2001) further demonstrated that overexpression of wildtype
PTEN leads to the suppression of cell growth through the blockade of
cell cycle progression, an increase in the abundance of p27 (600778), a
decrease in the protein levels of cyclin D1 (168461), and the inhibition
of Akt phosphorylation. In contrast, expression of the phosphatase-dead
mutation cys124 to ser (C124S; 601728.0023) promoted cell growth and had
the opposite effect on the abundance of p27, cyclin D1 levels, and the
phosphorylation of Akt. The gly129-to-glu mutation (G129E; 601728.0001),
which retains only protein phosphatase activity, behaved like C124S
except that the former caused decreased cyclin D1 levels similar to
wildtype PTEN. The authors concluded that PTEN exerts its growth
suppression through lipid phosphatase-dependent and -independent
activities and, most likely, via the coordinate effect of both protein
phosphatase and lipid phosphatase activities.

In another study, Weng et al. (2001) showed that PTEN appears to play a
unique role in the insulin signaling pathway in a breast cancer model.
Ectopic expression of wildtype PTEN in epithelial breast cancer cells
resulted in universal inhibition of Akt phosphorylation in response to
stimulation by diverse growth factors and selective inhibition of MEK
(600982)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK; 600997)
phosphorylation stimulated by insulin (176730) or insulin-like growth
factor 1 (IGF1; 147440). The latter was accompanied by a decrease in the
phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1; 147545) and the
association of IRS1 with Grb2 (108355)/Sos (182530), without affecting
the phosphorylation status of the insulin receptor and Shc (600560), nor
Shc/Grb2 complex formation. The MEK inhibitor PD980059, but not the PI3K
inhibitor wortmannin, abolished the effect of PTEN on insulin-stimulated
cell growth. The authors hypothesized that PTEN may block MAPK
phosphorylation in response to insulin stimulation by inhibiting the
phosphorylation of IRS1 and IRS1/Grb2/Sos complex formation, which may
lead to downregulation of cyclin D1, inhibition of cell cycle
progression, and suppression of cell growth.

Mutation in the PTEN gene accompanies progression of brain tumors from
benign to the most malignant forms. Tumor progression, particularly in
aggressive and malignant tumors, is associated with the induction of
angiogenesis, a process termed the angiogenic switch. Wen et al. (2001)
reported data indicating that PTEN regulates tumor-induced angiogenesis
and the progression of gliomas to a malignant phenotype via the
regulation of phosphoinositide-dependent signals.

Wishart et al. (2001) reviewed PTEN and myotubularin (300415)
phosphoinositide phosphatases. Phosphoinositides play an integral role
in a diverse array of cellular signaling processes. Although
considerable effort has been directed toward characterizing the kinases
that produce inositol lipid second messengers, the study of phosphatases
that oppose these kinases had been limited. Research has been focused on
the identification of novel lipid phosphatases such as PTEN and
myotubularin, their physiologic substrates, signaling pathways, and
links to human diseases. Wishart et al. (2001) pointed out the
usefulness of bioinformatics in conjunction with genetic analyses in
model organisms in the elucidation of roles of these enzymes in
regulating phosphoinositide-mediated cellular signaling.

Shallow gradients of chemoattractants, sensed by G protein-linked
signaling pathways, elicit localized binding of PH domains specific for
PI(3,4,5)P3 at sites on the membrane where rearrangements of the
cytoskeleton and pseudopod extension occur. Iijima and Devreotes (2002)
showed that disruption of PTEN in Dictyostelium discoideum dramatically
prolonged and broadened the PH domain relocation and actin
polymerization responses, causing the cells lacking PTEN to follow a
circuitous route toward the attractant. Exogenously expressed PTEN-GFP
localized to the surface membrane at the rear of the cell. Membrane
localization required a putative PI(4,5)P2-binding motif and was
required for chemotaxis. These results suggested that specific
phosphoinositides direct actin polymerization to the leading edge of the
cell and that regulation of PTEN plays a critical role in gradient
sensing and directional migration.

Funamoto et al. (2002) investigated the mechanisms of leading edge
formation in chemotaxing Dictyostelium cells. They demonstrated that
while PI3K transiently translocated to the plasma membrane in response
to chemoattractant stimulation and to the leading edge in chemotaxing
cells, PTEN, a negative regulator of PI3K pathways, exhibited a
reciprocal pattern of localization. By uniformly localizing PI3K along
the plasma membrane, Funamoto et al. (2002) showed that chemotaxis
pathways were activated along the lateral sides of cells and that PI3K
could initiate pseudopod formation, providing evidence for a direct
instructional role of PI3K in leading edge formation. These findings
provided evidence that differential subcellular localization and
activation of PI3K and PTEN is required for proper chemotaxis.

Vaults are large cytoplasmic ribonucleoproteins composed largely of MVP
(605088) and vault RNA (VTRNA1-1; 612695). Using a yeast 2-hybrid
screen, Yu et al. (2002) showed that PTEN interacted with MPV.
Endogenous PTEN associated with vault particles isolated from HeLa
cells. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis confirmed the interaction between
PTEN and MVP. Deletion analysis mapped the interacting regions to the C2
domain of PTEN and the EF-hand motifs of MVP. The interaction was
independent of tyrosine phosphorylation, but required calcium,
consistent with a calcium-induced conformational change in the MVP
EF-hand motifs.

Waite and Eng (2002) provided a comprehensive review of PTEN and
discussed the concept of the PTEN hamartoma-tumor syndrome (PHTS). They
reviewed data that led them to conclude that juvenile polyposis syndrome
(174900) is not a PHTS.

By analyzing PTEN-deficient tumor cell lines, Nakamura et al. (2000)
determined that PTEN deficiency leads to aberrant localization of FKHR
(136533) to the cytoplasm. Restoration of PTEN expression restored FKHR
to the nucleus and restored transcriptional activation. The authors
found evidence that FKHR is an effector of PTEN-associated functions, in
that FKHR induced apoptosis in cells that undergo PTEN-mediated
apoptosis, and FKHR mediated G1 arrest in cells that undergo
PTEN-mediated cell cycle arrest.

Modur et al. (2002) found that both FKHR and FKHRL1 (602681) were highly
expressed in normal prostate. They also noted that, in a PTEN-deficient
prostate carcinoma cell line, FKHR and FKHRL1 were cytoplasmically
sequestered and inactive, and expression of TRAIL (603598), a
proapoptotic effector, was decreased. Modur et al. (2002) determined
that TRAIL is a direct target of FKHRL1, and they hypothesized that the
loss of PTEN contributes to increased tumor cell survival through
decreased transcriptional activity of FKHR and FKHRL1 followed by
decreased TRAIL expression and apoptosis.

Weng et al. (2002) demonstrated that overexpression of wildtype PTEN in
the MCF-7 breast cancer line resulted in a phosphatase
activity-dependent decrease in the phosphorylation of ETS2 (164740), a
transcription factor whose DNA-binding ability is controlled by
phosphorylation. Exposure of MCF-7 cells to insulin, IGF1, epidermal
growth factor (EGF; 131530) can lead to the phosphorylation of ETS2. The
MEK (MAP2K1; 176872) inhibitor PD590089 abrogated insulin-stimulated
phosphorylation of ETS2. In contrast, the PI3K inhibitor LY492002 had no
effect on insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of ETS2. Overexpression of
PTEN abrogated activation of the uPA Ras-responsive enhancer (PLAU1;
191840), a target of ETS2 action, in a phosphatase-dependent manner,
irrespective of the presence or absence of insulin. The authors
suggested that PTEN may block insulin-stimulated ETS2 phosphorylation
through inhibition of the ERK members of the MAP kinase family
independently of PI3K, and that the PTEN effect on the phosphorylation
status of ETS2 may be mediated through PTEN's protein phosphatase
activity.

Germline mutations in BMPR1A (601299), the gene encoding the type 1A
receptor of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP), have been found in rare
families with Cowden syndrome, or Cowden-like syndrome (601299.0005),
suggesting that there may be a link between BMP signaling and PTEN.
Waite and Eng (2003) found that exposure to BMP2 (112261) increased PTEN
protein levels in the breast cancer cell line MCF-7. The increase in
PTEN protein was rapid and was not due to an increase in new protein
synthesis, suggesting that BMP2 stimulation inhibited PTEN protein
degradation. BMP2 treatment of MCF-7 cells decreased the association of
PTEN with 2 proteins in the degradative pathway, UBE2L3 (603721) and
UBE2E3 (604151). The authors suggested that BMP2 exposure may regulate
PTEN protein levels by decreasing PTEN's association with the
degradative pathway, which may explain how BMPR1A may act as a minor
susceptibility gene for PTEN-mutation-negative Cowden syndrome.

Goberdhan and Wilson (2003) reviewed the functions of PTEN.

Inactivation of PTEN and overexpression of VEGF are 2 of the most common
events observed in high-grade malignant gliomas (see 137800).
Gomez-Manzano et al. (2003) showed that transfer of PTEN to glioma cells
under normoxic conditions decreased the level of secreted VEGF protein
by 42 to 70% at the transcriptional level. Assays suggested that PTEN
acts on VEGF most likely via downregulation of the transcription factor
HIF1-alpha and by inhibition of PI3K. Increased PTEN expression also
inhibited the growth and migration of glioma-activated endothelial cells
in culture.

Raftopoulou et al. (2004) demonstrated that PTEN inhibits cell migration
through its C2 domain, independent of its lipid phosphatase activity.
This activity depends on the protein phosphatase activity of PTEN and on
the dephosphorylation at a single residue, threonine-383. Raftopoulou et
al. (2004) suggested that the ability of PTEN to control cell migration
through its C2 domain is likely to be an important feature of its tumor
suppressor activity.

Nagata et al. (2004) showed that PTEN not only antagonizes tumorigenesis
but also sensitizes breast cancers to targeted therapy with trastuzumab
(Herceptin), a humanized monoclonal antibody against ERBB2 (164870). The
authors provided data that clarified the antitumoral mechanism of
trastuzumab and helped clarify the mechanism underlying resistance. They
showed that, on binding to the ERBB2 receptor, trastuzumab stabilizes
and activates the PTEN tumor suppressor and consequently downregulates
the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. When the expression of PTEN is reduced
or abrogated, this chain of events is interrupted and the antitumoral
effects of trastuzumab are impaired. Nagata et al. (2004) confirmed, in
a small group of patients, that the presence of low levels of PTEN
correlated with unresponsiveness to trastuzumab treatment. Pandolfi
(2004) discussed ways to make use of this information with drugs that
augment PTEN levels and other strategies.

By yeast 2-hybrid screening, in vitro protein binding assays with
recombinant proteins, and coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins,
Okahara et al. (2004) demonstrated a direct interaction between the
C-terminal domain of PTEN and GLTSCR2 (605691). The interaction required
amino acids 338 through 348 of GLTSCR2 and a C-terminal segment of PTEN
that did not include the PDZ domain. Downregulation of GLTSCR2 in breast
carcinoma cells by RNA interference enhanced the degradation of PTEN
with concomitant decrease in PTEN phosphorylation. PTEN C-terminal
tumor-associated mutants, which are highly susceptible to protein
degradation, were unable to bind GLTSCR2 and showed reduced
phosphorylation. Okahara et al. (2004) concluded that GTSCR2 interacts
directly with PTEN and promotes its phosphorylation and stability.

Sanchez et al. (2005) found that the inhibitory effect of sphingosine
1-phosphate (S1P) on mammalian cell migration required PTEN as a
signaling intermediate downstream of EDG5 (605111) and Rho GTPase
activation. S1P activation of EDG5 stimulated complex formation between
EDG5 and PTEN in the membrane compartment, and EDG5 signaling increased
PTEN phosphorylation and its phosphatase activity in membrane fractions.
Sanchez et al. (2005) concluded that EDG5 regulates PTEN by a Rho
GTPase-dependent pathway to inhibit cell migration.

Chen et al. (2005) showed that conditional inactivation of Trp53
(191170) in the mouse prostate failed to produce a tumor phenotype,
whereas complete Pten inactivation in the prostate triggered nonlethal
invasive prostate cancer after long latency. Strikingly, combined
inactivation of Pten and Trp53 elicited invasive prostate cancer as
early as 2 weeks after puberty and was invariably lethal by 7 months of
age. Importantly, acute Pten inactivation induced growth arrest through
the p53-dependent cellular senescence pathway both in vitro and in vivo,
which could be fully rescued by combined loss of Trp53. In addition,
Chen et al. (2005) detected evidence of cellular senescence in specimens
from early-stage human prostate cancer. Chen et al. (2005) concluded
that their results demonstrated the relevance of cellular senescence in
restricting tumorigenesis in vivo and supported a model for cooperative
tumor suppression in which p53 is an essential failsafe protein of
Pten-deficient tumors.

In MCF7 human breast cancer cells, Waite et al. (2005) showed that
stimulation with phytoestrogens, such as resveratrol, quercetin and
genistein, resulted in an increase in PTEN protein levels. Phytoestrogen
stimulation also resulted in decreased Akt1 (164730) phosphorylation and
an increase in p27 (CDKN1B; 600778) protein levels, indicating active
PTEN lipid phosphatase activity. In contrast, MAPK1 (176948)
phosphorylation and cyclin D1 (CCND1; 168461) levels, which are
regulated by PTEN activity, were not altered. PTEN mRNA levels were
slightly increased in cells stimulated by phytoestrogens, suggesting
that the mechanism for increased PTEN protein expression may be
dependent upon transcription. Waite et al. (2005) hypothesized that a
mechanism for the protective effect of phytoestrogens against breast
cancer may be partially through increased PTEN expression.

Valiente et al. (2005) showed that the C-terminal tail of human PTEN
bound to the PDZ domains of rat Magi2 (606382), Magi3, and Dlg (DLG1;
601014), mouse Sast (MAST1; 612256) and Mast205 (MAST2; 612257), and
human MAST3 (612258). Interaction of PTEN with Magi2 increased PTEN
protein stability, and interaction of PTEN with the MAST kinases
facilitated phosphorylation of PTEN by these kinases.

Mehenni et al. (2005) identified PTEN as an LKB1 (STK11;
602216)-interacting protein. Several LKB1 point mutations associated
with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS; 175200) disrupted the interaction with
PTEN, suggesting that loss of this interaction might contribute to PJS.
Although PTEN and LKB1 are predominantly cytoplasmic and nuclear,
respectively, their interaction led to a cytoplasmic relocalization of
LKB1. PTEN was found to be a substrate of the kinase LKB1 in vitro. As
PTEN is a dual phosphatase mutated in autosomal inherited disorders with
phenotypes similar to those of PJS, such as Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba
syndrome (BRRS; 153480) and Cowden disease (158350), Mehenni et al.
(2005) suggested a functional link between the proteins involved in
different hamartomatous polyposis syndromes and emphasized the central
role played by LKB1 as a tumor suppressor in the small intestine.

Agrawal et al. (2005) characterized the transcriptional and biochemical
outcomes of 5 distinct splice site mutations in the PTEN gene, leading
to the skipping of exon 3, 4, or 6, among patients with classic CS,
BRRS, and CS- or BRRS-like features. The splice site mutations leading
to the deletion of exon 3, 4, or 6 resulted in reduced dual phosphatase
activities of PTEN. Deletion of exon 4 was associated with severely
reduced lipid phosphatase activity, whereas exon 3 skipping resulted in
markedly reduced protein phosphatase activity. In addition, exon 3
deleted transcript and protein were stable and localized to the nucleus
more efficiently than the wildtype PTEN. In contrast, exon 4 skipping
resulted in unstable transcripts and severely truncated unstable PTEN
protein lacking its phosphatase domain.

Yilmaz et al. (2006) conditionally deleted the Pten tumor suppressor
gene in adult hematopoietic cells. This led to myeloproliferative
disease within days and transplantable leukemias within weeks. Pten
deletion also promoted hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) proliferation.
However, this led to HSC depletion via a cell-autonomous mechanism,
preventing these cells from stably reconstituting irradiated mice. In
contrast to leukemia-initiating cells, HSCs were therefore unable to
maintain themselves without Pten. These effects were mostly mediated by
mTOR (601231) as they were inhibited by rapamycin. Rapamycin not only
depleted leukemia-initiating cells but also restored normal HSC
function. Yilmaz et al. (2006) concluded that mechanistic differences
between normal stem cells and cancer stem cells can thus be targeted to
deplete cancer stem cells without damaging normal stem cells.

Zhang et al. (2006) showed that inactivation of Pten in bone marrow HSCs
causes their short-term expansion but long-term decline, primarily owing
to an enhanced level of HSC activation. Pten-deficient HSCs engrafted
normally in recipient mice, but had an impaired ability to sustain
hematopoietic reconstitution, reflecting the dysregulation of their cell
cycle and decreased retention in the bone marrow niche. Mice with
Pten-mutant bone marrow also had an increased representation of myeloid
and T-lymphoid lineages and developed myeloproliferative disorder.
Notably, the cell populations that expanded in PTEN mutants matched
those that become dominant in the acute myeloid/lymphoid leukemia that
develops in later stages of myeloproliferative disorder (MPD). Thus,
Zhang et al. (2006) concluded that PTEN has essential roles in
restricting the activation of HSCs, in lineage fate determination, and
in the prevention of leukemogenesis.

Zhao et al. (2006) showed that electric fields, of a strength equal to
those detected endogenously, direct cell migration during wound healing
as a prime directional cue. Manipulation of endogenous wound electric
fields affects wound healing in vivo. Electric stimulation triggers
activation of Src and inositol-phospholipid signaling, which polarizes
in the direction of cell migration. Notably, genetic disruption of
phosphatidylinositol-3-hydroxykinase gamma (PIK3CG; 601232) decreased
electric field-induced signaling and abolished directed movements of
healing epithelium in response to electric signals. Deletion of PTEN
enhanced signaling and electrotactic responses. Zhao et al. (2006)
concluded that their data identified genes essential for electrical
signal-induced wound healing and showed that PIK3CG and PTEN control
electrotaxis.

Okumura et al. (2006) showed that PCAF (602303), a histone
acetyltransferase that regulates gene transcription, interacted
physically and functionally with PTEN. PCAF acetylated PTEN on lys125
and lys128 within the catalytic cleft essential for phosphoinositol
phosphate specificity, and this acetylation depended on the presence of
growth factors. Reduction of endogenous PCAF in human embryonic kidney
cells using short hairpin RNA resulted in loss of PTEN acetylation in
response to growth factors, and restored PTEN- mediated downregulation
of PI3K signaling and induction of G1 cell cycle arrest.
Acetylation-resistant PTEN mutants retained the ability to regulate PI3K
and induce cell cycle arrest following PCAF overexpression.

Takahashi et al. (2006) found that PTEN interacted with NHERF1
(SLC9A3R1; 604990) and NHERF2 (SLC9A3R2; 606553) adaptor proteins. A
ternary complex was formed between PTEN, NHERF proteins and PDGFR (see
PDGFRA; 173490), resulting in activation of the PI3K pathway upon PDGF
(see PDGFA; 173430) binding. In Nherf1 -/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts,
activation of the PI3K pathway by Pdgfr was prolonged in comparison with
wildtype cells, consistent with defective Pten recruitment to Pdgfr in
the absence of Nherf1. Depletion of Nherf2 by small interfering RNA
similarly increased PI3K signaling. Loss of Nherf1 enhanced Pdgf-induced
cytoskeletal rearrangements and chemotactic migration. Takahashi et al.
(2006) concluded that NHERF proteins recruit PTEN to PDGFR to restrict
PI3K activation.

In studies in human astrocytes engineered to contain alterations
functionally equivalent to those seen in human malignant glioma, Parsa
et al. (2007) demonstrated that expression of the PDCD1LG1 gene (605402)
increased posttranscriptionally after loss of PTEN and activation of the
PI3K pathway. Levels of B7H1, the PDCD1LG1 gene product, correlated with
PTEN loss in glioblastoma specimens, and tumor-specific T cells lysed
human glioma targets expressing wildtype PTEN more effectively than
those expressing mutant PTEN. Parsa et al. (2007) concluded that
immunoresistance in glioma is related to loss of the tumor suppressor
PTEN and is mediated in part by B7H1.

Some T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL) show resistance to
gamma-secretase inhibitors, which act by blocking NOTCH1 (190198)
activation. Using microarray analysis, Palomero et al. (2007) identified
PTEN as the gene most consistently downregulated in gamma-secretase
inhibitor-resistant T-cell lines. Further analysis showed that these
resistant cell lines had truncating mutations in the PTEN gene. Loss of
PTEN function resulted in aberrant activation of the PI3-kinase-AKT
signaling pathway, which induced resistance to gamma-secretase
inhibitors. Studies in normal mouse thymocytes indicated that Notch1
regulated Pten expression downstream. Notch signaling and the
PI3-kinase-AKT pathway acted synergistically in a Drosophila model of
Notch-induced tumorigenesis. The findings demonstrated that NOTCH1
controls a transcriptional network that regulates PTEN expression and
PI3-kinase-AKT signaling activity in normal thymocytes and leukemic T
cells.

Mazurek et al. (2007) showed that introduction of phosphorylated GAL3
(LGALS3; 153619) into a GAL3-null human breast cancer cell line promoted
apoptotic cell death through TRAIL (TNFSF10; 603598), a member of the
tumor necrosis factor family that transmits death signals through death
domain-containing receptors. Downstream, TRAIL sensitivity depended upon
induction of PTEN expression and inactivation of the PI3K/AKT survival
pathway.

Using protein pull-down assays, Wang et al. (2007) showed that PTEN
interacted directly with endogenous NEDD4 (602278) in human embryonic
kidney cells. NEDD4, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, polyubiquitinated PTEN and
negatively regulated its stability.

Trotman et al. (2007) found that monoubiquitination of PTEN permitted
its shuttling to nuclei, while polyubiquitination led to cytoplasmic
retention and degradation. They further found that lys289 and lys13 were
targets for ubiquitination, and their mutation led to a constitutive
shuttling defect that was overcome by forced monoubiquitination.
Knockdown of NEDD4 in human or mouse cells led to cytoplasmic and/or
perinuclear accumulation of PTEN, suggesting that NEDD4 is required for
PTEN monoubiquitination. Nuclear PTEN retained its ability to antagonize
AKT and cause apoptosis. Trotman et al. (2007) concluded that retention
of nuclear import capability of PTEN is critical for its
tumor-suppressive effects.

Drinjakovic et al. (2010) showed that Pten opposed arborization of
retinal ganglion cell axonal projections to the tectum in developing
Xenopus embryos. Proteasomal degradation of Pten via Nedd4, and possibly
netrin-1 (NTN1; 601614), was required to permit arborization.

Using wildtype and Pten-defective mouse embryonic fibroblasts, Shen et
al. (2007) showed that nuclear Pten was essential to maintain chromosome
integrity. Pten localized at centromeres and associated directly with
Cenpc (117140), an integral component of kinetochores. Loss of Pten led
to extensive centromere breakage and defects in DNA double-strand break
repair. Pten regulated Rad51 (179617) at the transcriptional level, thus
contributing to chromosome stability.

Alvarez-Breckenridge et al. (2007) found that overexpression of PTEN in
a human breast cancer cell line increased phospholipase D (see 602382)
activity, resulting in increased phosphatidic acid and decreased
phosphatidylcholine. They hypothesized that PTEN modulates PLC (see
PLCG1; 172420)-PLD activation pathways, in addition to activating the
AKT pathway.

Guo et al. (2008) showed that Pten deletion in mouse hematopoietic stem
cells leads to a myeloproliferative disorder, followed by acute T
lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Self-renewable leukemia stem cells are
enriched in the c-Kit(mid)CD3+Lin- compartment, where unphosphorylated
beta-catenin is significantly increased. Conditional ablation of one
allele of the beta-catenin gene (CTNNB1; 116806) substantially decreased
the incidence and delayed the occurrence of T-ALL caused by Pten loss,
indicating that activation of the beta-catenin pathway may contribute to
the formation or expansion of the leukemia stem cell population.
Moreover, a recurring chromosomal translocation, t(14;15), results in
aberrant overexpression of the c-myc oncogene in c-Kit(mid)CD3+Lin-
leukemic stem cells and CD3+ leukemic blasts, recapitulating a subset of
human T-ALL. No alterations in Notch1 signaling were detected in this
model, suggesting that Pten inactivation and c-myc overexpression may
substitute functionally for Notch1 abnormalities, leading to T-ALL
development. Guo et al. (2008) concluded that genetic or molecular
alterations contribute cooperatively to leukemia stem cell
transformation.

Mao et al. (2008) demonstrated that mTOR (601231) is targeted for
ubiquitination and consequent degradation by binding to the tumor
suppressor protein FBXW7 (606278). Human breast cancer cell lines and
primary tumors showed a reciprocal relation between loss of FBXW7 and
deletion or mutation of PTEN, which also activates mTOR. Tumor cell
lines harboring deletions or mutations in FBXW7 are particularly
sensitive to rapamycin treatment, suggesting to Mao et al. (2008) that
loss of FBXW7 may be a biomarker for human cancers susceptible to
treatment with inhibitors of the mTOR pathway.

Song et al. (2008) found that PTEN was aberrantly localized in acute
promyelocytic leukemia (APL; 612376) in which PML (102578) function was
disrupted by the PML-RARA (180240) fusion oncoprotein. Treatment with
drugs that triggered PML-RARA degradation restored nuclear PTEN. PML
opposed the activity of HAUSP (USP7; 602519) towards PTEN through a
mechanism involving DAXX (603186). Confocal microscopy and
immunohistochemistry demonstrated that HAUSP was overexpressed in
prostate cancer and that levels of HAUSP directly correlated with tumor
aggressiveness and with PTEN nuclear exclusion. Song et al. (2008)
concluded that a PML-HAUSP network controls PTEN deubiquitinylation and
subcellular localization, which is perturbed in human cancers.

Zheng et al. (2008) showed that concomitant central nervous
system-specific deletion of p53 (191170) and Pten in the mouse central
nervous system generates a penetrant acute-onset high grade malignant
glioma phenotype with notable clinical, pathologic, and molecular
resemblance to primary glioblastoma in humans. This genetic observation
prompted TP53 and PTEN mutation analysis in human primary glioblastoma,
demonstrating unexpectedly frequent inactivating mutations of TP53 as
well as the expected PTEN mutations. Integrated transcriptomic
profiling, in silico promoter analysis, and functional studies of murine
neural stem cells established that dual, but not singular, inactivation
of p53 and Pten promotes an undifferentiated state with high renewal
potential and drives increased Myc (190080) protein levels and its
associated signature. Functional studies validated increased Myc
activity as a potent contributor to the impaired differentiation and
enhanced renewal of neural stem cells doubly null for p53 and Pten
(p53-/-Pten-/-) as well as tumor neurospheres derived from this model.
Myc also serves to maintain robust tumorigenic potential of
p53-/-Pten-/- tumor neurospheres. These murine modeling studies,
together with confirmatory transcriptomic/promoter studies in human
primary glioblastoma, validated a pathogenetic role of a common tumor
suppressor mutation profile in human primary glioblastoma and
established Myc as an important target for cooperative actions of p53
and Pten in the regulation of normal and malignant stem/progenitor cell
differentiation, self-renewal, and tumorigenic potential.

To test for the role of intrinsic impediments to axon regrowth, Park et
al. (2008) analyzed cell growth control genes using a virus-assisted in
vivo conditional knockout approach. Deletion of PTEN, a negative
regulator of the mTOR pathway, in adult retinal ganglion cells promoted
robust axon regeneration after optic nerve injury. In wildtype adult
mice, the mTOR activity was suppressed and new protein synthesis was
impaired in axotomized retinal ganglion cells, which may have
contributed to the regeneration failure. Reactivating this pathway by
conditional knockout of tuberous sclerosis complex-1 (TSC1; 605284),
another negative regulator of the mTOR pathway, also led to axon
regeneration.

Using immunohistochemical analysis, Kim et al. (2008) found that Pten
was highly expressed in mouse retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and in
retinal ganglion cell axons. RPE-specific deletion of Pten resulted in
RPE cells that failed to maintain basolateral adhesions, underwent
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and subsequently migrated
out of the retina entirely, leading to progressive death of
photoreceptors. Mutation analysis showed that the C-terminal PDZ-binding
domain of Pten was essential for maintenance of RPE cell junctional
integrity. Inactivation of Pten, and loss of its interaction with
junctional proteins, were also evident in RPE cells isolated from Ccr2
(601267) -/- mice and from mice subjected to oxidative damage, both of
which displayed age-related macular degeneration. Kim et al. (2008)
concluded that PTEN has an essential role in normal RPE cell function
and in the response of these cells to oxidative stress.

Kalaany and Sabatini (2009) showed that certain human cancer cell lines,
when grown as tumor xenografts in mice, are highly sensitive to the
antigrowth effects of dietary restriction, whereas others are resistant.
Cancer cell lines that form dietary restriction-resistant tumors carry
mutations that cause constitutive activation of the
phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K; see PIK3CA, 171834) pathway and in
culture proliferate in the absence of insulin (176730) or insulin-like
growth factor-1 (IGF1; 147440). Substitution of an activated mutant
allele of PIK3CA with wildtype PIK3CA in otherwise isogenic cancer
cells, or the restoration of PTEN expression in a PTEN-null cancer cell
line, was sufficient to convert a dietary restriction-resistant tumor
into one that was dietary restriction-sensitive. Dietary restriction did
not affect a PTEN-null mouse model of prostate cancer, but it
significantly decreased tumor burden in a mouse model of lung cancer
lacking constitutive PI3K signaling. Kalaany and Sabatini (2009)
concluded that the PI3K pathway is an important determinant of the
sensitivity of tumors to dietary restriction, and activating mutations
in the pathway may influence the response of cancers to dietary
restriction-mimetic therapies. Kalaany and Sabatini (2009) also found
that overexpression of FOXO1 (136533) sensitizes tumors to dietary
restriction.

Huse et al. (2009) showed that MIR26A (see MIR26A2; 613057) is a direct
regulator of PTEN expression. MIR26A was overexpressed in a subset of
high-grade gliomas, primarily due to amplification of the MIR26A2 locus,
a genomic event strongly associated with monoallelic PTEN loss. In a
mouse glioma model Mir26a reduced Pten levels, facilitating glioma
formation. Mir26a overexpression functionally substituted for loss of
heterozygosity at the Pten locus.

Fine et al. (2009) identified phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate
RAC exchanger 2a (PREX2a, 612139) as a PTEN-interacting protein. PREX2a
mRNA was more abundant in human cancer cells and significantly increased
in tumors with wildtype PTEN that expressed an activated mutant of
PIK3CA encoding the p110 subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase subunit
alpha (PI3K-alpha). PREX2a inhibited PTEN lipid phosphatase activity and
stimulated the PI3K pathway only in the presence of PTEN. PREX2a
stimulated cell growth and cooperated with a PIK3CA mutant to promote
growth factor-independent proliferation and transformation. Depletion of
PREX2a reduced amounts of phosphorylated AKT and growth in human cell
lines with intact PTEN. Thus, Fine et al. (2009) concluded that PREX2a
is a component of the PI3K pathway that can antagonize PTEN in cancer
cells.

Teresi et al. (2008) showed that SREBP (see 184756) induced PTEN protein
expression in MCF-7 cells via upregulation of PPAR-gamma (PPARG;
601487). Several statins also induced both PTEN mRNA and protein and
PPARG activity. However, while SREBP used PPARG transcriptional activity
to upregulate PTEN expression, the statins appeared to regulate PPARG
protein activity, resulting in upregulation of PTEN expression.

Sathaliyawala et al. (2010) found that the Mtor inhibitor rapamycin
impaired mouse Flt3l (FLT3LG; 600007)-driven dendritic cell (DC)
development in vitro, with plasmacytoid DCs and classical DCs most
profoundly affected. Depletion of the Pi3k-Mtor negative regulator Pten
facilitated Flt3l-driven DC development in culture. Targeting Pten in
DCs in vivo caused expansion of Cd8 (see 186910)-positive and Cd103
(ITGAE; 604682)-positive classical DCs, which could be reversed by
rapamycin. Increased Cd8-positive classical DC numbers caused by Pten
deletion correlated with increased susceptibility to Listeria infection.
Sathaliyawala et al. (2010) concluded that PI3K-MTOR signaling
downstream of FLT3L controls DC development, and that restriction by
PTEN ensures optimal DC numbers and subset composition.

Deletion of either PTEN or SOCS3 (604176) in adult retinal ganglion
cells (RGCs) individually promotes significant optic nerve regeneration,
but regrowth tapers off around 2 weeks after crush injury (Park et al.,
2008; Smith et al., 2009). Sun et al. (2011) showed that, remarkably,
simultaneous deletion of both PTEN and SOCS3 enables robust and
sustained axon regeneration. Sun et al. (2011) further showed that PTEN
and SOCS3 regulate 2 independent pathways that act synergistically to
promote enhanced axon regeneration. Gene expression analyses suggested
that double deletion not only results in the induction of many
growth-related genes, but also allows RGCs to maintain the expression of
a repertoire of genes at the physiologic level after injury. Sun et al.
(2011) concluded that their results revealed concurrent activation of
mTOR (601231) and STAT3 (102582) pathways as key for sustaining
long-distance axon regeneration in adult central nervous system, a
crucial step towards functional recovery.

- Regulation of PTEN Expression by PTENP1 Transcript Levels

Poliseno et al. (2010) described the functional relationship between the
mRNAs produced by the PTEN tumor suppressor gene and its pseudogene
PTENP1 (613531) and the critical consequences of this interaction.
Poliseno et al. (2010) found that PTENP1 is biologically active as it
can regulate cellular levels of PTEN and exert a growth-suppressive
role. They also found that the PTENP1 locus is selectively lost in human
cancer. Poliseno et al. (2010) extended their analysis to other
cancer-related genes that possess pseudogenes, such as the oncogene KRAS
(190070), and its pseudogene KRAS1P. Poliseno et al. (2010) also
demonstrated that the transcripts of protein-coding genes such as PTEN
are biologically active, and concluded that their findings attribute a
novel biological role to expressed pseudogenes, as they can regulate
coding gene expression, and reveal a noncoding function for mRNAs.

Pal et al. (2012) measured insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function as
well as anthropometric indices in 15 patients diagnosed with Cowden
disease who carried mutations in the PTEN gene as well as 15 age-, sex-,
and body mass index (BMI)-matched controls. Measures of insulin
resistance were lower in patients with PTEN mutations than in controls
(p = 0.001), which was confirmed by hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamping
studies. Increased AKT phosphorylation was observed in patients versus
controls, suggesting that the patients' increased insulin sensitivity
might be explained by enhanced insulin signaling through the PI3K/AKT
pathway (see 164730). In addition, PTEN mutation carriers were obese
compared to population-based controls (p less than 0.001); the increased
body mass was due to augmented adiposity without corresponding changes
in fat distribution. Pal et al. (2012) concluded that PTEN
haploinsufficiency appears to result in an increased risk of obesity and
cancer but a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes (125853), owing to
enhanced insulin sensitivity.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Blumenthal and Dennis (2008) provided a detailed review of PTEN
hamartoma syndromes.

- Cowden Disease

Liaw et al. (1997) identified germline mutations in 4 of 5 families with
Cowden disease (CD). They found missense (601728.0001) and nonsense
(601728.0002; 601728.0003) mutations predicted to disrupt the protein
tyrosine/dual-specificity phosphatase domain of the protein. Nelen et
al. (1997) confirmed the PTEN gene as the Cowden disease gene in 8
unrelated families and reported germline missense mutations in CD
families (e.g., 601728.0005).

Genetic heterogeneity of Cowden disease was suggested by the fact that
Tsou et al. (1997) found no coding sequence mutations in 23 CD families
for whom linkage to the PTEN locus had never been established. They
reported 3 novel PTEN mutations in Cowden disease and demonstrated that
these mutations were associated with Cowden disease and breast cancer.
They found no PTEN mutations in a group of individuals with early-onset
breast cancer, suggesting that germline mutations in the PTEN gene are
not common in this group.

Tsou et al. (1998) found 3 mutations in the PTEN gene in unrelated
individuals with Cowden disease. These included a missense mutation in
exon 5, a splice site mutation in intron 7 causing exon skipping, and a
missense mutation in exon 3. Tsou et al. (1998) also reported a rare
polymorphism in exon 7 of the PTEN coding sequence.

Marsh et al. (1998) identified PTEN mutations in 30 of 37 (81%) Cowden
disease families, including missense and nonsense point mutations,
deletions, insertions, a deletion/insertion, and splice site mutations.
These mutations were scattered over the entire length of PTEN, with the
exception of the first, fourth, and last exons. A 'hotspot' for PTEN
mutation in Cowden disease was identified in exon 5, which contains the
PTPase core motif, with 13 of 30 (43%) Cowden disease mutations
identified in that exon. Thus, 7 of 30 (23%) were within the core motif,
the majority (5 of 7) of which were missense mutations, possibly
pointing to the functional significance of this region.

Kurose et al. (1999) examined a 35-year-old Japanese man who had been
followed clinically for juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS; 174900)
because of numerous hamartomatous polypoid lesions throughout the
digestive tract, from esophagus to rectum. Although he had none of the
pathognomonic skin lesions of Cowden disease, mutations in the PTEN gene
were sought. He was found to be heterozygous for a G-to-A transition at
the second nucleotide of codon 130, resulting in an arg130-to-gln
(R130Q; 601728.0017) substitution. The patient's mother and sister did
not carry this mutation; the father had died of brainstem infarction, a
condition thought to be unrelated to Cowden disease. On closer
examination of the patient, Kurose et al. (1999) found a small thyroid
adenoma, a few papillomatous papules on his right hand, and a lung
tumor, which was being examined for possible malignancy. Waite and Eng
(2002) classified this patient as a case of Cowden disease and referred
to the patient's 'classic cutaneous features.'

Cowden syndrome and Bannayan-Ruvalcaba-Riley syndrome share clinical
characteristics such as hamartomatous polyps of the gastrointestinal
tract, mucocutaneous lesions, and increased risk of developing
neoplasms. Furthermore, both conditions and several other distinctive
phenotypes are caused by mutations in the PTEN gene. For this reason
Marsh et al. (1999) suggested that the spectrum of disorders be referred
to as PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS).

Trotman et al. (2007) identified lys13 and lys289 as major
monoubiquitination sites essential for PTEN import. They showed that a
K289E mutant protein showed normal activity and membrane association but
lacked monoubiquitination at the mutated site and was excluded from
nuclei. Immunohistochemical staining of intestinal polyps from a Cowden
patient with the mutation revealed both nuclear and cytoplasmic PTEN
staining in normal-appearing mucosa that retained wildtype PTEN;
however, PTEN was excluded from the nuclei of epithelial cells that had
lost the wildtype PTEN allele.

Pezzolesi et al. (2007) identified germline deletions involving the
5-prime promoter region of the PTEN gene in 4 of 30 patients with Cowden
syndrome who did not have point mutation in the coding regions of the
gene. The deletions were associated with a decrease in PTEN activity and
upregulation of downstream targets. The findings indicated that
alterations at cis-regulatory elements can contribute to disease
pathogenesis.

Lobo et al. (2009) reported that somatic colorectal carcinoma-derived
PTEN missense mutations were associated with nuclear mislocalization.
These mutations altered cellular proliferation, apoptosis, and
anchorage-dependent growth and were found to reside in previously
undescribed ATP-binding motifs (residues 60 to 73 and residues 122 to
136) in the N-terminal phosphatase domain. In contrast to wildtype PTEN,
both cancer-associated somatic and germline-derived PTEN missense
mutations (see, e.g., R130Q, 601728.0017) within the ATP-binding motifs
resulted in mutant PTEN that did not bind ATP efficiently. The Cowden
syndrome patients with germline ATP-binding motif-mutations had nuclear
PTEN mislocalization. Of 4 unrelated patients with functional germline
ATP-binding domain mutations, all 3 female patients had breast cancers.
Lobo et al. (2009) concluded that germline and somatic mutations within
PTEN ATP-binding domains may play important pathogenic roles in both
heritable and sporadic carcinogenesis by PTEN nuclear mislocalization,
resulting in altered signaling and growth.

- Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba Syndrome

In a patient referred with a diagnosis of Bannayan-Zonana syndrome
(153480), also known as Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba Syndrome (BRRS), or
macrocephaly, multiple lipomas, and hemangiomata, Arch et al. (1997)
demonstrated an interstitial deletion of 10q23.2-q24.1. They
demonstrated that the PTEN gene was missing from the deleted chromosome.
Because of phenotypic overlap between the BRRS and Cowden disease and
because of the apparent mapping to the same chromosomal area, Arch et
al. (1997) proposed that Cowden disease and BRRS are allelic.

Balciuniene et al. (2007) described this patient and 2 others who shared
deletion of 10q22-q23 with cognitive and behavioral abnormalities. They
suggested that the 10q22.3-q23.32 region should be added to the list of
genomic regions affected by recurring rearrangements (612242). They
related the breakpoint in each family to the organization of complex
low-copy repeats (LCRs) located in the proximity of the deletions. The
breakpoints in 2 of the families mapped within these LCRs, whereas the
deletion in the family of Arch et al. (1997) removed the telomeric LCR
and had a complex noncontiguous structure. Balciuniene et al. (2007)
proposed that the LCRs in this region increased susceptibility to
chromosomal rearrangements.

Marsh et al. (1997) identified germline mutations in PTEN in the
hamartomatous polyposis syndrome, which they referred to as
Bannayan-Zonana syndrome (BZS), but which goes by a number of other
designations, including Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome. Hamartomas
are benign, hyperplastic, disorganized growths. Characteristic features
of BZS include macrocephaly, lipomas, intestinal hamartomatous polyps,
vascular malformations, Hashimoto thyroiditis, and speckled pigmentation
of the penis. Many patients present at birth with macrocephaly and
failure to thrive. The disorder has been described particularly in young
patients. Cowden disease has been described mainly in older individuals
and is characterized by hamartomas in multiple organs and a risk of
breast and thyroid cancer. Breast tumors are said to occur in 75% of
females with Cowden disease and thyroid disease in 50 to 75%;
macrocephaly (38%) and lipomas (less than 5%) are less common, and
speckled penis apparently does not occur. Hamartomatous polyps occur in
the Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (175200), which is associated with melanin
spots of the lips, buccal mucosa, and digits. The Peutz-Jeghers syndrome
maps to 19p, without genetic heterogeneity, and juvenile polyposis
(174900) to 10q22. Cowden syndrome maps to a region of 10q thought to be
telomeric to the juvenile polyposis region. In studies of 2 unrelated
well-characterized BZS families, Marsh et al. (1997) found that affected
individuals demonstrated haplotype sharing for the 10q22-q23 region.
Therefore, PTEN mutations were sought, with the demonstration of
germline mutations, arg233ter (R233X; exon 7; 601728.0002) in one family
and ser170arg (S170R; exon 6; 601728.0004) in the second family. The
R233X mutation had been found in a family with classic Cowden disease by
Liaw et al. (1997). The identical mutation occurred in these 2 families
with 2 distinct syndromes on 2 different 10q22-q23 haplotypes, arguing
against a common ancestor or founder effect. The only common clinical
features in the CD family and the BZS family with R233X were
macrocephaly and thyroid disease.

Marsh et al. (1998) identified germline PTEN mutations in 4 of 7 (57%)
Bannayan-Zonana syndrome families studied. None of these mutations was
observed in the PTPase core motif.

Longy et al. (1998) identified germline PTEN mutations in 6 subjects
from 4 unrelated European families with the Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba
phenotype. They noted that 4 of the 7 mutations described thus far in
BRRS patients result in a truncated protein, and they concluded that the
defect responsible for BRRS corresponds to an inactivating mutation.
Longy et al. (1998) also noted that 4 mutations associated with the BRRS
phenotype occur in exon 6 of PTEN, whereas 2 mutations associated with
this phenotype occur in exon 7. They contrasted this with mutations
associated with Cowden syndrome, where mutations in PTEN are spread over
the entire gene with the exceptions of exons 1, 4, and 9.

- 'Proteus-like' Syndrome

Zhou et al. (2000) reported a boy with congenital hemihypertrophy,
epidermoid nevi, macrocephaly, lipomas, arteriovenous malformations, and
normal intellect. He was given the clinical diagnosis of 'Proteus-like'
syndrome because of phenotypic similarities to Proteus syndrome
(176920). Molecular analysis identified a heterozygous germline R335X
mutation, and a somatic R130X (601728.0007) mutation in a nevus, lipoma,
and arteriovenous malformation from the patient. The authors postulated
that the second hit, R130X, occurred early in embryonic development and
may even represent germline mosaicism. Thus, PTEN may be involved in
'Proteus-like' syndrome with its implications for cancer development in
the future. Cohen et al. (2003) disputed the diagnosis of Proteus
syndrome in the patient reported by Zhou et al. (2000). Cohen et al.
(2003) stated that some of the clinical features were not consistent
with classic Proteus syndrome and noted that the term 'Proteus-like
syndrome' is unhelpful and confounding.

Loffeld et al. (2006) reported a 3-year-old boy with a germline PTEN
missense mutation inherited from his mother who had Cowden syndrome. The
boy showed extensive epidermal nevus, macrocephaly, vascular
malformations, asymmetric hypertrophy of 1 leg, localized macrodactyly,
and abdominal lipoma. They identified loss of heterozygosity for the
PTEN mutation in an epidermal nevus from the boy, suggesting wildtype
PTEN allele loss.

Caux et al. (2007) reported 2 unrelated families in which multiple
members had typical Cowden syndrome confirmed by genetic analysis. The
female proband of 1 family had an atypical phenotype of segmental
overgrowth, lipomas, vascular malformations, and epidermal nevi, and
molecular analysis revealed loss of the wildtype allele in several
atypical lesions, including a cutaneous fibroma, an epidermal nevus, and
a lipoma. The female proband of the other family also had an atypical
presentation but lacked epidermal nevus, and molecular analysis of a
single biopsy of her affected skin did not show loss of the wildtype
PTEN allele. The findings suggested that heterozygous germline PTEN
mutations associated with a mosaic inactivation of the wildtype allele
may underlie multiple atypical dysmorphisms suggestive of other
diseases, including 'Proteus-like' syndrome, previously reported by Zhou
et al. (2000) and Loffeld et al. (2006). These atypical lesions could be
explained by biallelic inactivation and complete loss of PTEN function,
resulting in segmental exacerbations of the disease. To clinically
distinguish between Proteus syndrome and segmental exacerbation of
Cowden disease, Caux et al. (2007) suggested 'SOLAMEN syndrome' as an
acronym for segmental overgrowth, lipomatosis, arteriovenous
malformation, and epidermal nevus.

- Macrocephaly/Autism Syndrome

Butler et al. (2005) performed PTEN gene mutation analysis in 18
subjects with autism spectrum disorders and macrocephaly (605309). They
identified germline PTEN mutations in 3 young boys: H93R (601728.0037),
D252G (601728.0038), and F241S (601728.0039), respectively. There were
no features suggestive of Cowden syndrome or Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba
syndrome except for pigmented macules on the glans penis of 1
mutation-positive boy.

Herman et al. (2007) reported 2 unrelated patients with
macrocephaly/autism syndrome who had each had a heterozygous mutation in
the PTEN gene (601728.0007 and 601728.0040).

O'Roak et al. (2012) identified 3 heterozygous de novo mutations in the
PTEN gene while sequencing 44 candidate genes among 2,446 autism
spectrum disorder probands. There were 2 missense and 1 frameshift
mutation identified (601728.0042-601728.0044). All 3 patients were
macrocephalic.

- Prostate Cancer

Deletion mapping studies based on loss of heterozygosity on 10q
identified the region 10q23 to be the minimal area of loss in cases of
sporadic prostate cancer. As noted earlier, the PTEN tumor suppressor
gene, which was found to be inactivated by mutation in 3 prostate cancer
cell lines, was isolated from this region. Cairns et al. (1997) screened
80 prostate tumors by microsatellite analysis and found chromosome 10q23
to be deleted in 23 cases. They performed a sequence analysis of the
entire PTEN coding region and tested for homozygous deletion with new
intragenic markers in these 23 cases with 10q23 loss of heterozygosity.
In 10 of the tumors (43%) they identified the second mutation, thus
establishing PTEN as a main inactivation target of 10q loss in sporadic
prostate cancer.

Forrest et al. (2000) studied 188 subjects from 50 prostate cancer
families in which 3 or more individuals or a sib pair with 1 diagnosed
before age 67 had prostate cancer. Pairwise and multipoint linkage
analysis showed no evidence of linkage to the PTEN region.

In a study of 188 probands with hereditary prostate cancer (176807), Xie
et al. (2011) identified 15 different germline variants in the PTEN
gene, none of which was located in an exon. However, there was no
segregation of these variants with prostate cancer. There were no
significant differences in the allele frequencies of 33 SNPs spanning
the PTEN gene in 1,527 sporadic cases and 482 controls or in aggressive
and non-aggressive cancer. Finally, an association between copy number
variation involving the PTEN gene and prostate cancer was not found. Xie
et al. (2011) concluded that germline variants in the PTEN gene do not
have an important role in susceptibility to prostate cancer.

- Breast Cancer

Shugart et al. (1999) reported linkage analysis, using markers flanking
the PTEN locus, of 56 families that had 3 or more individuals with
breast cancer and in whom a BRCA1 (113705) or BRCA2 (600185) mutation
had not been found. Parametric and nonparametric analysis did not
support linkage to the PTEN locus in these families; an overall
multipoint lod score of -8.25 was obtained. Shugart et al. (1999)
concluded that PTEN is not a major contributor to familial breast
cancer.

Because of the association of CD with breast cancer, Figer et al. (2002)
screened the 9 coding exons of the PTEN gene in 2 subsets of Israeli
patients: 12 patients clinically diagnosed with BRRS, and 89 women with
an apparently inherited predisposition to breast cancer, some with
salient features of CD. Two of 3 familial BRRS patients exhibited novel
germline mutations in PTEN and, among the 89 high-risk women, 2
mutations were detected in exon 4. The study suggested that PTEN does
not play a major role in predisposing to hereditary breast cancer in
Israeli women, and that detection of PTEN mutations in BRRS patients is
more likely in familial cases.

Kurose et al. (2002) demonstrated high frequencies of somatic mutations
in TP53 (191170) and PTEN in breast neoplastic epithelium and stroma.
Mutations in TP53 and PTEN were mutually exclusive in either
compartment. In contrast, mutations in WFDC1 (605322) occurred at low
frequency in the stroma.

Basal-like breast cancer is a subtype of breast cancer that is highly
proliferative, poorly differentiated, and has a poor prognosis. These
tumor cells express cytokeratin markers typical of basally oriented
epithelial cells of the normal mammary gland. Saal et al. (2008) found
that loss of PTEN protein expression was significantly associated with
the basal-like cancer subtype in both nonhereditary breast cancer and
hereditary BRCA1-deficient breast cancer. Loss of PTEN in the
BRCA1-deficient basal-like breast cancer tumors was associated with
frequent gross PTEN mutations, including intragenic chromosome breaks,
inversions, deletions, and micro copy number alterations, consistent
with a mechanism involving inappropriate repair of double-strand DNA
breaks. The findings indicated a specific and recurrent oncogenic
consequence of BRCA1-dependent dysfunction in DNA repair and implied
that the PTEN pathway is directly involved in transformation of
basal-like progenitor cells.

- Malignant Melanoma

Birck et al. (2000) analyzed the coding region of the PTEN/MMAC1 gene in
uncultured specimens of malignant melanoma (155600) from 16 primary and
61 metastatic tumors from 67 patients. They found mutations in 4 of the
metastatic samples (7%), and analysis of 2 intragenic polymorphisms
showed allelic loss in 3 of 8 informative primary tumors (38%) and in 18
of 31 metastatic tumors (58%). One of the mutant cases showed allelic
loss, suggesting that both PTEN/MMAC1 alleles were inactivated in this
tumor. Birck et al. (2000) proposed that mutation and deletion of
PTEN/MMAC1 may contribute to the development and progression of
malignant melanoma. Celebi et al. (2000) examined 21 metastatic melanoma
samples and found LOH at 10q23 in 7 of 21 samples and identified
sequence alterations in the PTEN gene in 4 of the samples and sequence
alterations in the p16 gene (CDKN2A; 600160) in 2 of the samples. One
case showed mutations in both genes.

Wang et al. (2009) studied samples from 59 melanomas, 47 in situ and 12
invasive, from 8 patients with xeroderma pigmentosum. PTEN mutations
were found in 56% of the melanomas, and 91% of the melanomas with
mutations had 1 to 4 UV-type base substitutions, i.e., occurring at
adjacent pyrimidines (p less than 0.0001 compared to random mutations).
Almost 70% were mutations that altered amino acids, and transfection
studies demonstrated that the mutations impaired PTEN function. Wang et
al. (2009) stated that these data provide direct molecular evidence of
UV involvement in melanoma induction in humans.

- Cervical Cancer

Cervical cancer (603956) is not a known component of either Cowden
syndrome or Bannayan-Zonana syndrome; however, LOH of markers on
chromosome 10q is frequently observed in cervical cancers. To determine
the potential role that PTEN mutation may play in cervical
tumorigenesis, Kurose et al. (2000) screened 20 primary cervical cancers
for LOH of polymorphic markers within and flanking the PTEN gene, and
for intragenic mutations in the entire coding region and exon-intron
boundaries of the PTEN gene. LOH was observed in 7 of 19 (36.8%) cases.
Further, 1 sample may have had a homozygous deletion. Three (15%)
intragenic mutations were found: 2 were somatic missense mutations in
exon 5, which encodes the phosphatase motif, and the third was an occult
germline intronic sequence variant in intron 7 that was shown to be
associated with aberrant splicing. All 3 samples with the mutations also
had LOH of the wildtype allele. The data indicated that disruption of
PTEN by allelic loss or mutation may contribute to tumorigenesis in
cervical cancers. In cervical cancer, however, unlike some other human
primary carcinomas, e.g., those of the breast and thyroid, biallelic
structural PTEN defects seem necessary for carcinogenesis.

- Endometrial Carcinoma

Somatic genetic and epigenetic inactivation of PTEN is involved in as
high as 93% of sporadic endometrial carcinomas, irrespective of
microsatellite status, and can occur in the earliest precancers.
Endometrial carcinoma is the most frequent extracolonic cancer in
patients with hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer syndrome (HNPCC; see
120435), characterized by germline mutations in the mismatch repair
(MMR) genes and by microsatellite instability in component tumors. Zhou
et al. (2002) obtained 41 endometrial carcinomas from 29 MLH1 (see
120436) or MSH2 (609309) mutation-positive HNPCC families and subjected
them to PTEN expression and mutation analysis. Immunohistochemical
analysis revealed 68% (28 of 41) of the HNPCC-related endometrial
carcinomas with absent or weak PTEN expression. Mutation analysis of 20
aberrant PTEN-expressing tumors revealed that 17 (85%) harbored 18
somatic PTEN mutations. All mutations were frameshift, 10 (56%) of which
involved the 6(A) tracts in exon 7 or 8. The authors suggested that PTEN
may play a significant pathogenic role in both HNPCC and sporadic
endometrial carcinogenesis, unlike the scenarios for colorectal cancer.
They further concluded that somatic PTEN mutations, especially
frameshift, may be a consequence of profound MMR deficiency in
HNPCC-related endometrial carcinomas.

- Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Head and Neck

Poetsch et al. (2002) studied the role of PTEN in head and neck squamous
cell carcinomas (HNSCC; 275355) in correlation to mutation and
methylation of the p16 gene and to previous studies concerning loss of
chromosomes 9 and 10. They screened for alterations in PTEN and p16 in
52 HNSCC of different sites and found mutations in 12 (23%) tumor
samples; PTEN missense mutations were found in 7 carcinomas (13%), and a
loss of chromosome 10 was detected in 5 (71%) of these.

- Multiple Cancers

De Vivo et al. (2000) reported mutation analysis of the PTEN gene in 103
women drawn from 32,826 members of the prospective Nurses' Health Study
cohort who had more than 1 primary tumor at different anatomic sites.
They observed 2 novel germline heterozygous missense mutations in exon 5
in 5 of the cases. Neither mutation was observed in 115 controls free of
diagnosed cancer. Both mutants showed partial tumor suppressor activity
when compared to wildtype PTEN when transfected into a PTEN-null breast
cancer cell line. The phenotype was cell-line-specific, suggesting that
genetic background affects growth suppression activity of the mutants.

- Reviews

Bonneau and Longy (2000) reported that 110 germline PTEN mutations had
been reported in patients with 2 tumor-predisposing syndromes, with
overlapping clinical features: Cowden disease and
Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome. A mutation hotspot is found in exon
5, which encodes the phosphatase catalytic core motif, and recurrent
mutations had been found at CpG dinucleotides suggesting
deamination-induced mutations. In addition to these germline mutations,
they found reports of 332 somatic point mutations of PTEN, occurring in
primary tumors or metastasis. These occurred particularly in endometrial
carcinomas and glioblastomas. In most cases, these somatic mutations
resulted in protein inactivation and, as with germline mutations,
recurrent somatic mutations were found in CpG dinucleotides. A
mutagenesis by insertion-deletion in repetitive elements was
specifically observed in endometrial carcinomas.

Orloff and Eng (2008) provided a review of PTEN mutations and their
various phenotypic effects, with emphasis on the importance of
understanding PTEN-related pathways in the study of cancer genetics.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Marsh et al. (1999) screened for PTEN mutations in constitutive DNA
samples from 43 Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba individuals comprising 16
sporadic and 27 familial cases, 11 of which were families with both
Cowden disease and BRRS. Mutations were identified in 26 of 43 (60%)
BRRS cases. Genotype-phenotype analyses within the BRRS group suggested
a number of correlations, including the association of PTEN mutations
and cancer or breast fibroadenoma in any given CD, BRRS, or BRRS/CD
overlap family (P = 0.014), and, in particular, truncating mutations
were associated with the presence of cancer and breast fibroadenoma in a
given family (P = 0.024). Additionally, the presence of lipomas was
correlated with the presence of PTEN mutation in BRRS patients (P =
0.028). In contrast to the report of Carethers et al. (1998), in which
no PTEN mutations or deletions were identified in sporadic cases of
BRRS, Marsh et al. (1999) found that identification of germline PTEN
mutations was equally likely in sporadic and familial BRRS (P = 0.113).
Comparisons between BRRS and a previously studied group of 37 CD
families suggested an increased likelihood of identifying a germline
PTEN mutation in families with either CD alone or both CD and BRRS when
compared with BRRS alone (P = 0.002). Among CD, BRRS, and BRRS/CD
overlap families that were PTEN mutation positive, the mutation spectra
appeared similar. Thus, PTEN mutation-positive CD and BRRS may be
different presentations of a single syndrome and, hence, both should
receive equal attention with respect to cancer surveillance.

Zhou et al. (2003) stated that germline intragenic mutations in PTEN are
associated with 80% of patients with CS and 60% of patients with BRRS;
the underlying genetic causes in classic cases without a PCR-detectable
PTEN mutation had not been determined. They hypothesized that gross gene
deletions and mutations in the PTEN promoter might alternatively account
for a subset of apparently mutation-negative patients with these 2
disorders. Using real-time and multiplex PCR techniques in 122
apparently mutation-negative patients, 95 with classic CS and 27 with
BRRS, they identified 3 (11%) of 27 patients with BRRS or BBRS/CS
overlap who had germline hemizygous PTEN deletions; fine mapping
suggested that one deletion encompassed the whole gene (601728.0035),
one included exon 1, and one encompassed exons 1-5. Analysis of the PTEN
promoter revealed 9 cases (7.4%) harboring heterozygous germline
mutations. All 9 had classic CS, representing almost 10% of all patients
with CS studied. Eight had breast cancers and/or benign breast tumors
but, otherwise, involvement of fewer than 4 organs. PTEN protein
analysis, from 1 deletion-positive and 5 promoter mutation-positive
samples, showed a 50% reduction in protein and multiple bands of
immunoreactive protein, respectively. In contrast, control samples
showed only the expected band. Furthermore, an elevated level of
phosphorylated AKT was detected in the 5 promoter mutation-positive
samples, compared with controls, indicating an absence of or marked
reduction in functional PTEN. Zhou et al. (2003) concluded that patients
with BRRS and CS without PCR-detected intragenic PTEN mutations can be
offered clinical deletion analysis and promoter mutation analysis,
respectively.

Eng (2003) reviewed the many syndromes related to mutation in the PTEN
gene. Germline PTEN mutations had been found to occur in 80% of classic
CS, 60% of BRRS, up to 20% of Proteus syndrome (176920), and
approximately 50% of a 'Proteus-like' syndrome. Pooled analysis of PTEN
mutation series of CS and BRRS showed that 65% of CS-associated
mutations occur in the first 5 exons encoding the phosphatase domain and
the promoter region, while 60% of BRRS-associated mutations occur in the
3-prime 4 exons encoding mainly the C2 domain. Somatic PTEN mutations
occur with a wide distribution of frequencies in sporadic primary
tumors, with the highest frequencies in endometrial carcinomas and
glioblastoma multiforme.

To investigate whether all cases of Lhermitte-Duclos syndrome (LDD; see
158350), even without features of Cowden syndrome, are caused by
germline PTEN mutation and whether somatic PTEN mutation occurs in
sporadic LDD, Zhou et al. (2003) obtained paraffin-imbedded LDD lesions
from 18 unselected, unrelated patients and performed mutational analysis
of PTEN. All 15 (83%) of 18 samples were found to carry a PTEN mutation.
All individuals with mutations were adult-onset patients but the 3
without mutations were diagnosed at the ages of 1, 3, and 11 years.
Germline DNA was available from 6 adult-onset cases, and all germline
PTEN mutations. Of these 6, 2 had Cowden syndrome features, 1 did not
have Cowden syndrome features, and 3 were of unknown Cowden syndrome
status. Immunohistochemistry revealed that 75% of the LDD samples had
complete or partial loss of PTEN expression accompanied by elevated
phosphorylated Akt, specifically in the dysplastic gangliocytoma cells.
The high frequency and spectrum of germline PTEN mutations in patients
ascertained by LDD alone confirmed that LDD is an important defining
feature for Cowden syndrome. Individuals with LDD, even without apparent
Cowden features, should be counseled as in Cowden syndrome.

Although germline PTEN mutations have been identified in a significant
proportion of patients with the group of disorders referred to jointly
as the 'PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome' (PHTS), there are still many
individuals with classic diagnostic features for whom mutations have not
been identified. To address this, Pezzolesi et al. (2006) took a
haplotype-based approach and investigated the association of specific
genomic regions of the PTEN locus with PHTS. They found this locus to be
characterized by 3 distinct haplotype blocks of 33 kb, 65 kb, and 43 kb.
Comparisons of the haplotype distributions of all 3 blocks differed
significantly among patients with PHTS and controls. 'Rare' haplotype
blocks and extended haplotypes accounted for 2- to 3-fold more PHTS
chromosomes than control chromosomes. PTEN mutation-negative patients
were strongly associated with a haplotype block spanning a region
upstream of PTEN and the gene's first intron. Furthermore, allelic
combinations contributed to the phenotypic complexity of this syndrome.
Taken together, these data suggested that specific haplotypes and rare
alleles underlie the disease etiology in these sample populations;
constitute low-penetrance, modifying loci; and, specifically in the case
of patients with PHTS for whom traditional mutations have yet to be
identified, may harbor pathogenic variant(s) that have escaped detection
by standard PTEN mutation-scanning methods.

In a discussion of the genetics of health and the role of modifier genes
in modulating the penetrance, dominance, expressivity, and pleiotropy of
disease genes, Nadeau and Topol (2006) commented on the remarkable fact
that the same PTEN germline mutation may result in different syndromes
(see, for example, 601728.0002), suggesting that modifier genes dictate
the specific cancers and developmental anomalies that occur in
particular individuals, families, and populations.

Patients with Cowden syndrome with germline PTEN promoter mutations have
aberrant PTEN protein expression and an increased frequency of breast
cancer (Zhou et al., 2003). Teresi et al. (2007) examined the downstream
effect of 5 PTEN promoter variants, including -861G/T (601728.0034) and
-764G/A (601728.0033), that are not within any known cis-acting
regulatory elements. Clinically, the patients with these variants had
been given diagnoses of breast, thyroid, and/or endometrial cancer.
Teresi et al. (2007) found that protein binding to the PTEN promoter
(-893 to -755) was not altered in these variants when compared with
wildtype. However, reporter assays indicated that 3 of the variants,
including -861G/T and -764G/A, demonstrated a decrease of approximately
50% in luciferase activity compared with the wildtype construct. PTEN
mRNA levels were not altered in these variants, whereas secondary
structure predictions indicated that different PTEN 5-prime untranslated
region transcript-folding patterns existed in 3 variants, suggesting an
inhibition of protein translation. This was confirmed by PTEN protein
analysis. These data indicated that variants causing large mRNA
secondary structure alterations result in an inhibition of protein
translation and a decrease in PTEN protein expression. The data
emphasized the importance of PTEN promoter nucleotide variations and
their ability to lead to Cowden syndrome progression by a novel
regulatory mechanism. Importantly, these patients have a high prevalence
of breast, thyroid, and endometrial malignancies.

Lachlan et al. (2007) were unable to find a genotype/phenotype
correlation among 42 patients from 26 families with PTEN mutations and
clinical features of either Cowden syndrome or BRRS. The earliest
features of the PTEN-related phenotype were macrocephaly and hamartomas,
with mucocutaneous features and sometimes malignancies developing over
time in the same patients.

Pezzolesi et al. (2008) presented evidence that the microRNAs MIRN19A
(609418) and MIRN21 (611020) may act as genetic modifiers in Cowden
syndrome and its related phenotypes. MIRN19A and MIRN21 specifically
target and downregulate PTEN. Among 28 PTEN mutation-positive patients
carrying 1 of 3 truncating PTEN mutations (R130X, 601728.0007; R233X,
601728.0002; or R335X, 601728.0021), the authors found that variable
PTEN protein levels were inversely correlated with MIRN19A and MIRN21
expression levels in patients with the R130X and/or R233X mutations.
This association was not observed in those with the R335X mutation.
MIR19A and MIRN21 were also differentially expressed in a series of 130
PTEN-mutation-negative patients with variable clinical phenotypes and
decreased full-length PTEN protein expression. The findings indicated
that differential expression of these 2 miRNAs could modulate PTEN
protein levels and the Cowden syndrome and Cowden syndrome-like
phenotypes, irrespective of the patient's mutation status, thus
supporting their roles as genetic modifiers.

ANIMAL MODEL

To examine the role of the dual-specificity phosphatase PTEN in
ontogenesis and tumor suppression, Di Cristofano et al. (1998) disrupted
mouse Pten by homologous recombination. Pten inactivation resulted in
early embryonic lethality. Homozygous deficient ES (embryonic stem)
cells formed aberrant embryoid bodies and displayed an altered ability
to differentiate into endodermal, ectodermal, and mesodermal
derivatives. Heterozygous knockout mice and chimeric mice derived from
heterozygous ES cells showed hyperplastic/dysplastic changes in the
prostate, skin, and colon, which are characteristic of Cowden disease,
Lhermitte-Duclos disease, and Bannayan-Zonana syndrome. They also
spontaneously developed germ cell, gonadostromal, thyroid, and colon
tumors. In addition, Pten inactivation enhanced the ability of ES cells
to generate tumors in nude and syngeneic mice, due to increased
anchorage-independent growth and aberrant differentiation. These results
supported the notion that PTEN haploinsufficiency plays a causal role in
the 3 disorders in which mutations had been found, and demonstrated that
Pten is a tumor suppressor essential for embryonic development.

Stambolic et al. (1998) found that Pten-mutant mouse embryos displayed
regions of increased proliferation. In contrast, Pten-deficient
immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts exhibited decreased sensitivity
to cell death in response to a number of apoptotic stimuli, accompanied
by constitutively elevated activity and phosphorylation of protein
kinase B (PKB)/Akt, a crucial regulator of cell survival. Expression of
exogenous Pten in mutant cells restored both their sensitivity to
agonist-induced apoptosis and normal pattern of PKB/Akt phosphorylation.
Furthermore, Pten negatively regulated intracellular levels of
phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate in cells and dephosphorylated
it in vitro. These results showed that PTEN may exert its role as a
tumor suppressor by negatively regulating the PI3K/PKB/Akt signaling
pathway.

Di Cristofano et al. (1999) demonstrated that Pten heterozygous mutant
mice develop a lethal polyclonal autoimmune disorder with features
reminiscent of those observed in Fas (134637)-deficient mutants.
Fas-mediated apoptosis was impaired in Pten +/- mice, and T lymphocytes
from these mice showed reduced activation-induced cell death and
increased proliferation upon activation. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
inhibitors restored Fas responsiveness in Pten +/- mice. Di Cristofano
et al. (1999) concluded that Pten is an essential mediator of the Fas
response and a repressor of autoimmunity, and that their results
implicated the PI3 kinase/Akt pathway in Fas-mediated apoptosis.

Inactivation of the PTEN gene and lack of p27(KIP1) expression (600778)
have been detected in most advanced prostate cancers. But mice deficient
for Cdkn1b, which encodes p27(Kip1), do not develop prostate cancer.
PTEN activity leads to the induction of p27(KIP1) expression, which in
turn can negatively regulate the transition through the cell cycle.
Thus, the inactivation of p27(KIP1) may be epistatic to PTEN in the
control of the cell cycle. Di Cristofano et al. (2001) showed that the
concomitant inactivation of 1 Pten allele and 1 or both Cdkn1b alleles
accelerates spontaneous neoplastic transformation and incidence of
tumors of various histologic origins. Cell proliferation, but not cell
survival, is increased in mice that are heterozygous for knockout of the
Pten gene and homozygous for knockout of the Cdkn1b gene. Moreover,
these heterozygous/homozygous mice developed prostate carcinoma at
complete penetrance within 3 months from birth. These cancers
recapitulated the natural history and pathologic features of human
prostate cancers. The findings reveal the crucial relevance of the
combined tumor-suppressive activity of Pten and p27(Kip1) through the
control of cell cycle progression.

In prostate cancer and other human malignancies, high rates of LOH are
observed at the 10q23.3 region containing the human PTEN gene, but the
demonstrated rate of biallelic inactivation of the PTEN gene by mutation
or homozygous deletion is significantly lower than the rate of LOH.
Kwabi-Addo et al. (2001) studied the transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse
prostate model and found that when these mice were bred to Pten +/-
mice, haploinsufficiency of the Pten gene promoted the progression of
prostate cancer. This observation may explain the discordance in rates
of LOH at 10q23 and biallelic PTEN inactivation observed in prostate
cancer and many other human malignancies.

Backman et al. (2001) generated a tissue-specific deletion of the mouse
homolog Pten to address its role in brain function. Mouse homozygous for
this deletion developed seizures and ataxia by 9 weeks and died by 29
weeks. Histologic analysis showed brain enlargement as a consequence of
primary granule-cell dysplasia in the cerebellum and dentate gyrus. Pten
mutant cells showed a cell-autonomous increase in soma size and elevated
phosphorylation of Akt (164730). These data represented the first
evidence for the role of Pten and Akt in cell size regulation in mammals
and provided an animal model for a human phakomatosis condition,
Lhermitte-Duclos disease.

Kwon et al. (2001) likewise investigated the function of PTEN in the
brain by selective inactivation of Pten in specific mouse neuronal
populations. Loss of Pten resulted in progressive macrocephaly and
seizures. Neurons lacking Pten expressed high levels of phosphorylated
Akt and showed a progressive increase in soma size without evidence of
abnormal proliferation. Cerebellar abnormalities closely resembled the
histopathology of human LDD. The results indicated that Pten regulates
neuronal size in vivo in a cell-autonomous manner.

Groszer et al. (2001) used conditional gene targeting to mutate the
mouse Pten gene only in embryonic neural stem cells. They noted
enlarged, abnormal brains resulting from increased cell proliferation,
decreased cell death, and enlarged cell size. The mice died shortly
after birth with no signs of hydrocephalus. Analysis of isolated
aggregates of neuronal progenitors (neurospheres) from these mice showed
that they contained more and larger cells per sphere and that the cells
displayed an increased number of cell divisions. Groszer et al. (2001)
concluded that PTEN deficiency results in increased proliferation and
self renewal of neural stem cells without a major disturbance of cell
fate commitments. In a commentary, Penninger and Woodgett (2001)
suggested that PTEN may be important for maintaining the
pluripotentiality of neural and other types of stem cells and may allow
for enhanced production of neuronal stem cells.

Using a high-throughput screen, Schwartzbauer and Robbins (2001) found
that mouse Pten was actively translated in experimentally induced
cardiac hypertrophy and that the protein level increased in the absence
of increased mRNA expression. Overexpression of Pten caused apoptosis in
neonatal rat primary cardiomyocytes and blocked growth factor signaling
through the phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate pathway. Expression
of a catalytically inactive Pten mutant led to cardiomyocyte
hypertrophy, with increased protein synthesis, cell surface area, and
atrial natriuretic factor (108780) expression. Hypertrophy was also
accompanied by increased Akt activity and improved cell viability in
culture.

Crackower et al. (2002) showed that cardiomyocyte-specific inactivation
of Pten in mice resulted in hypertrophy and, unexpectedly, a dramatic
decrease in cardiac contractility. Analysis of Pten/Pi3k-gamma
double-mutant mice revealed that the cardiac hypertrophy and
contractility defects could be genetically uncoupled. Pi3k-alpha
(171834) was found to mediate the alteration in cell size, while
Pi3k-gamma was found to act as a negative regulator of cardiac
contractility. Mechanistically, Pi3k-gamma inhibited cAMP production,
and hypercontractility could be reverted by blocking cAMP function.
These data showed that PTEN has an important in vivo role in
cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and G protein-coupled receptor signaling and
identified a function for the PTEN-PI3K-gamma pathway in the modulation
of heart muscle contractility.

By selective inactivation of Pten in mouse B lymphocytes and
immunohistochemical analysis, Anzelon et al. (2003) detected a selective
expansion of marginal zone (MZ) B and B1 cells. Pten-deficient B cells
were hyperproliferative in response to mitogenic stimuli and had a lower
threshold for activation through the B lymphocyte antigen receptor.
Inactivation of Pten rescued germinal center, MZ B, and B1 cell
formation in Cd19 (107265) -/- mice, which exhibit reduced activation of
PI3K . Anzelon et al. (2003) concluded that intracellular
phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate has a central role in the
regulation of differentiation of peripheral B-cell subsets.

Kwak et al. (2003) found that intratracheal administration of PI3K
inhibitors or adenoviruses carrying PTEN cDNA reduced bronchial
inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness in a mouse model of asthma
(600807). Pi3k activity increased after allergen (ovalbumin) challenge,
while Pten protein expression and activity decreased after allergen
challenge. Immunoreactive Pten localized in epithelial layers around the
bronchioles in control mice, but Pten staining disappeared in asthmatic
lungs. PI3K inhibitors or adenovirus PTEN administration reduced the Il4
(147780), Il5 (147850), and eosinophil cationic protein (RNASE3; 131398)
levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids. Kwak et al. (2003) concluded
that PTEN may play a role in the pathogenesis of asthma.

Kwon et al. (2003) found that inhibition of Mtor (FRAP1; 601231)
decreased the seizure frequency and death rate in mice with conditional
Pten deficiency, prevented the increase in Pten-deficient neuronal soma
size in young mice, and reversed neuronal soma enlargement in adult
mice. Mtor inhibition did not decrease the size of wildtype adult
neurons. Kwon et al. (2003) concluded that MTOR is required for neuronal
hypertrophy downstream of PTEN deficiency, but it is not required for
maintenance of normal neuronal soma size. They proposed that MTOR
inhibitors may be useful therapeutic agents for the treatment of brain
diseases resulting from PTEN deficiency, such as Lhermitte-Duclos
disease or glioblastoma multiforme.

Backman et al. (2004) selectively inactivated Pten in murine tissues in
which the MMTV-LTR (mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat)
promoter is active, resulting in hyperproliferation and neoplastic
changes in Pten null skin and prostate. These phenotypes had early onset
and were completely penetrant. Abnormalities in Pten mutant skin
consisted of mild epidermal hyperplasia, whereas prostates from these
mice exhibited high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia that
frequently progressed to focally invasive cancer. These data
demonstrated that Pten is an important physiologic regulator of growth
in the skin and prostate. Further, the early onset of prostatic
intraepithelial neoplasia in Pten mutant males was unique to this animal
model and implicated PTEN mutations in the initiation of prostate
cancer. Consistent with high PTEN mutation rates in human prostate
tumors, these data indicated that PTEN is a critical tumor suppressor in
this organ.

Horie et al. (2004) generated mice with a conditional
hepatocyte-specific null mutation of the Pten gene. Mutant mice
developed massive hepatomegaly and steatohepatitis with triglyceride
accumulation, a phenotype similar to human nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.
Adipocyte-specific genes were induced in mutant hepatocytes, and genes
involved in lipogenesis and beta-oxidation were also induced. Almost
half of the mutant mice developed liver cell adenomas by 44 weeks of
age; by 74 to 78 weeks of age, 100% of the livers of mutant mice showed
adenomas and 66% had hepatocellular carcinomas. The mutant mice also
showed insulin hypersensitivity. Horie et al. (2004) concluded that PTEN
is an important regulator of lipogenesis, glucose metabolism, hepatocyte
homeostasis, and tumorigenesis in the liver.

By delivering a recombinant adenoviral vector expressing Cre recombinase
to the bursal cavity that encloses the ovary, Dinulescu et al. (2005)
expressed an oncogenic Kras (190070) allele within the ovarian surface
epithelium and observed benign epithelial lesions with a typical
endometrioid glandular morphology that did not progress to ovarian
carcinoma (167000); 7 of 15 mice (47%) also developed peritoneal
endometriosis (131200). When the Kras mutation was combined with
conditional deletion of Pten, all mice developed invasive endometrioid
ovarian adenocarcinomas. Dinulescu et al. (2005) stated that these were
the first mouse models of endometriosis and endometrioid adenocarcinoma
of the ovary.

Hamada et al. (2005) generated mice with endothelial cell-specific Pten
deletion. Mutant embryos died before embryonic day 11.5 due to bleeding
and cardiac failure. The phenotype was caused by impaired recruitment of
pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells to blood vessels and of
cardiomyocytes to the endocardium. They showed that enhanced
angiogenesis depended on both PI3K subunits p110-gamma (PIK3CG; 601232)
and p85-alpha (PIK3R1; 171833), but that the defect in cardiovascular
morphogenesis was more dependent on p110-gamma than p85-alpha. Hamada et
al. (2005) concluded that interaction of PI3Ks and PTEN is essential for
regulation of cardiovascular morphogenesis and postnatal
neovascularization, including tumor angiogenesis.

Chen et al. (2006) demonstrated that Akt1 deficiency attenuated tumor
development in Pten +/- mice.

Kwon et al. (2006) found that mice with targeted inactivation of the
Pten gene in differentiated neurons of the cerebral cortex and
hippocampus demonstrated abnormal social interaction and exaggerated
responses to sensory stimuli. The mice also showed macrocephaly and
neuronal hypertrophy, including hypertrophic and ectopic dendrites and
axon tracts with increased synapses. The findings suggested that Pten
defects in mice can result in macrocephaly and autistic-like behavior.

Intestinal polyposis, a precancerous neoplasia, results primarily from
an abnormal increase in the number of crypts, which contain intestinal
stem cells (ISCs). In mice, widespread deletion of the tumor suppressor
Pten generates hamartomatous intestinal polyps with epithelial and
stromal involvement. Using this model, He et al. (2007) established the
relationship between stem cells and polyp and tumor formation. PTEN
helps govern the proliferation rate and number of ISCs and loss of PTEN
results in an excess of ISCs. In Pten-deficient mice, excess ISCs
initiate de novo crypt formation and crypt fission, recapitulating crypt
production in fetal and neonatal intestine. The PTEN-AKT (164730)
pathway probably governs stem cell activation by helping control nuclear
localization of the Wnt pathway effector beta-catenin (CTNNB1; 116806).
AKT phosphorylates beta-catenin at ser552, resulting in a
nuclear-localized form in ISCs. The observations showed that intestinal
polyposis is initiated by PTEN-deficient ISCs that undergo excessive
proliferation driven by Akt activation and nuclear localization of
beta-catenin.

Liu et al. (2007) showed that mice with osteoblast-specific Pten
deficiency were of normal size but demonstrated dramatic and
progressively increasing bone mineral density throughout life. In vitro,
osteoblasts lacking Pten differentiated more rapidly than controls and
exhibited greatly reduced apoptosis associated with increased levels of
phosphorylated Akt and activation of Akt signaling.

To assess the usefulness of mouse models in cancer gene discovery and
the extent of cross-species overlap in cancer-associated copy number
aberrations, Maser et al. (2007) engineered lymphoma-prone mice with
chromosomal instability. Along with targeted resequencing, their
comparative oncogenomic studies identified FBXW7 (606278) and PTEN to be
commonly deleted both in murine lymphomas and in human T-cell acute
lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL). The murine cancers acquired
widespread recurrent amplifications and deletions targeting loci
syntenic to those not only in human T-ALL but also in diverse human
hematopoietic, mesenchymal, and epithelial tumors. These results
indicated that murine and human tumors experience common biologic
processes driven by orthologous genetic events in their malignant
evolution. Maser et al. (2007) concluded that the highly concordant
nature of genomic events encourages the use of genomically unstable
murine cancer models in the discovery of biologic driver events in the
human oncogenome.

Reddy et al. (2008) provided genetic evidence that in mice lacking Pten
in oocytes, the entire primordial follicle pool becomes activated. All
primordial follicles become depleted in early adulthood, causing
premature ovarian failure. Reddy et al. (2008) concluded that the
mammalian oocyte serves as the headquarters of programming of follicle
activation and that the oocyte PTEN-PI3K pathway governs follicle
activation through control of initiation of oocyte growth.

Page et al. (2009) showed that haploinsufficient Pten +/- mice were
macrocephalic and that female Pten +/- mice were impaired in social
approach behavior but not male Pten +/- mice. This phenotype was
exacerbated in Pten and Slc6a4 (182138) double haploinsufficient mice.
While increased brain size correlated with decreased sociability across
these genotypes in females, within each genotype, increased brain size
correlated with increased sociability, suggesting that epigenetic
influences interact with genetic factors in influencing the phenotype.
The findings suggested an interaction between 2 autism spectrum disorder
candidate genes during brain development.

Alimonti et al. (2010) generated transgenic hypomorphic (hy) mice with
decreasing levels of Pten expression: Pten (+/+), Pten (hy/+), Pten
(+/-), and Pten (hy/-). Reduction of Pten dose in mice resulted in
decreased survival, with Pten (+/-) mice showing a mean survival of 12
months and Pten (hy/-) mice showing a mean survival of about 8.5 months.
Pten (hy/+) also showed decreased survival compared to wildtype. Similar
to Pten (+/-) mutants, Pten (hy/+) mice had autoimmune disorders with
lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly, although the onset was delayed in the
Pten (hy/+) mice. Pten (hy/+), which expressed 80% of normal levels of
Pten, showed increased susceptibility to tumor development compared to
wildtype, with breast tumors occurring at the highest penetrance.
However, tumorigenesis was not as high as in Pten (+/-) mice. Tumor size
and proliferation increased with the reduction of Pten dosage. All
breast tumors analyzed from Pten (hy/+) mice retained 2 intact copies of
Pten and maintained Pten levels above the heterozygous levels,
indicating protein expression. Cellular studies showed that subtle
downregulation of Pten altered the steady-state biology of mammary
tissues and the expression profiles of genes involved in cancer cell
proliferation, such a cyclin B2 (CCNB2; 602755), cyclin D1 (CCND1;
168461), and Bub1 (602452). A proportion of human breast cancer tissue
showed similar changes with decreased PTEN expression. Alimonti et al.
(2010) proposed a continuum working model of tumorigenesis in which
subtle reductions in the dose of some tumor suppressor genes may
predispose to cancer development in a tissue-specific manner.

Cotter et al. (2010) showed that, in Schwann cells, mammalian disks
large homolog-1 (DLG1; 601014) interacts with Pten to inhibit axonal
stimulation of myelination. This mechanism limits myelin sheath
thickness and prevents overmyelination in mouse sciatic nerves. Removing
this brake results in myelin outfoldings and demyelination,
characteristics of some peripheral neuropathies. Indeed, the Dlg1 brake
is no longer functional in a mouse model of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease
(CMT4B1; 601382). Cotter et al. (2010) concluded that negative
regulation of myelination appears to be essential for optimization of
nerve conduction velocity and myelin maintenance.

Harrington et al. (2010) found that mice with conditional inactivation
of Pten in oligodendrocytes showed hypermyelination and increased myelin
sheath thickness in the corpus callosum and spinal cord during
development. Older mice showed progressive axonal myelin sheath
abnormalities associated with neurologic features, such as ataxia.
However, there was no improvement in myelination after white matter
injury in conditional Pten-knockout mice compared to control mice. The
findings indicated that Pten functions to regulate myelin thickness and
preserve axonal integrity in oligodendrocytes, but appears to be
dispensable during myelin repair.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
COWDEN DISEASE 1
PTEN, GLY129GLU

In a family with 2 males with Cowden disease (158350) manifested by
melanoma and trichilemmomas of the skin, adenocarcinoma of the breast,
and glioblastoma, Liaw et al. (1997) found that the PTEN gene carried a
transition of nucleotide 386, changing codon 129 from GGA (gly) to GAA
(glu). In a second family in which 2 males had Cowden disease manifested
by trichilemmoma and follicular adenoma of the thyroid, Liaw et al.
(1997) observed the same mutation.

Ramaswamy et al. (1999) showed that PTEN protein induces a G1 block when
reconstituted in PTEN-null cells. The G129E PTEN mutant, which is
associated with Cowden disease, was found to have protein phosphatase
activity yet was defective in dephosphorylating inositol
1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate in vitro and failed to arrest cells in G1.
These data suggested a link between induction of cell cycle block by
PTEN and its ability to dephosphorylate, in vivo, phosphatidylinositol
3,4,5-triphosphate. Tumor cells lacking PTEN contained high levels of
activated AKT1, suggesting that PTEN is necessary for the appropriate
regulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT1 pathway.

.0002
COWDEN DISEASE 1
BANNAYAN-RILEY-RUVALCABA SYNDROME, INCLUDED
PTEN, ARG233TER

In a family with 3 females with Cowden disease (158350) manifested by
trichilemmomas, multinodular goiter, and macrocephaly, Liaw et al.
(1997) observed a transition in nucleotide 697, changing codon 233 from
CGA (arg) to TGA (stop) (R233X).

In a family with Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome (153480), reported by
Gorlin et al. (1992), Marsh et al. (1997) identified this same R233X
mutation. The identical mutation, occurring in 2 unrelated families with
2 distinct syndromes, arose on 2 different 10q22-q23 haplotypes, arguing
against a common ancestor or founder effect. The only common clinical
features in both the Cowden disease family and the family reported by
Gorlin et al. (1992) with R233X were macrocephaly and thyroid disease.

.0003
LHERMITTE-DUCLOS DISEASE
PTEN, GLU157TER

In a family with 2 males and 2 females affected with Lhermitte-Duclos
disease (see 158350) manifested by trichilemmomas,
fibroadenoma/hamartoma of the breast, macrocephaly, and cerebellar
ataxia, Liaw et al. (1997) found in the PTEN gene a transversion at
nucleotide 697, converting codon 157 from GAA (glu) to TAA (stop).

.0004
BANNAYAN-RILEY-RUVALCABA SYNDROME
PTEN, SER170ARG

In affected members of a family with Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome
(153480), Marsh et al. (1997) identified a mutation in exon 6 of the
PTEN gene, resulting in a ser170-to-arg (S170R) substitution. Affected
members of the family showed macrocephaly and speckled penis with soft
tissue tumors (lipomas, hemangiomas, and leiomyomas).

.0005
COWDEN DISEASE 1
PTEN, HIS123ARG

In patients with Cowden disease (158350), Nelen et al. (1997) identified
3 different mutations in the active site sequence motif HCxxGxxRS/T
characteristic of protein tyrosine phosphatases and dual specificity
phosphatases. Two of these mutations were missense mutations, his123arg
and cys124arg (601728.0006), and 1 was a nonsense mutation, R130X
(601728.0007), which occurred twice. All 3 could be predicted to lead to
a complete or severe loss of phosphatase activity.

.0007
COWDEN DISEASE 1
BANNAYAN-RILEY-RUVALCABA SYNDROME, INCLUDED;;
MACROCEPHALY/AUTISM SYNDROME, INCLUDED
PTEN, ARG130TER

In a study of Cowden disease (158350), Nelen et al. (1997) found 2
independent occurrences of an arg130-to-ter (R130X) mutation in the PTEN
gene. The mutation involved a CpG dinucleotide.

Zori et al. (1998) described a family in which a mother had Cowden
disease and the son had macrocephaly, multiple lipomas, and
hemangiomata, also known as Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome (153480).
Both were heterozygous for the R130X mutation. The son had been seen at
the age of 11 years for severe developmental delay and autistic
behavior. In early childhood, rectal bleeding led to removal of a few
rectal polyps; the pathology showed benign pseudopolyp with
telangiectatic vessels in an inflamed myxoid stroma. His verbal and
performance IQs were 40 at 11 years. He developed a goiter at 18 years
for which left hemithyroidectomy was performed, and a tumor was also
excised from the right side of the thyroid. The left lobe contained in
insular (follicular) carcinoma while the right showed nodular
hyperplasia with a focus of papillary microcarcinoma. At the age of 11
years, the son had multiple pigmented macules on the glands and shaft of
the penis. He lacked the second toes. The mother of the patient reported
by Zori et al. (1998) had a large head (59.5 cm) and multiple small
papules on her tongue and oral mucosa. She had polyposis of the entire
gastrointestinal tract. Mammogram showed bilateral fibroglandular tissue
with single well-defined benign nodules in each breast with mild
dysplasia.

In a 4-year-old boy with macrocephaly/autism syndrome (605309), Herman
et al. (2007) identified a heterozygous R130X substitution. The
substitution occurs in exon 5 of the PTEN gene within the core
phosphatase domain of the protein. The child inherited the mutation from
his unaffected father. Herman et al. (2007) noted that the boy may
develop further clinical manifestations of other PTEN-associated
syndromes and emphasized that the family was counseled on the
possibility of increased tumor risk in the boy and the mutation-carrying
father.

.0008
ENDOMETRIAL CARCINOMA
PTEN, IVS4, G-A, +1

A high rate of loss of heterozygosity is observed at 10q23-q26 in
endometrial carcinomas (Peiffer et al., 1995; Nagase et al., 1996;
Safara et al., 1997; Peiffer-Schneider et al., 1998). Kong et al. (1997)
observed 38 endometrial-cancer DNAs for LOH at loci on chromosomes 2, 9,
and 10. Among 23 informative endometrial cancer samples, they found LOH
in 11 (48%). PCR-SSCP analysis or direct DNA sequencing was then
performed for all exons and intron-exon boundaries of the PTEN gene in
38 cancers. Whereas no mutation was found in PTEN in colorectal and
pancreatic tumors, mutations were identified in 21 of the 38 endometrial
carcinomas (55%). In each of 5 endometrial tumors without LOH, 2
mutations were seen. A variety of mutations were identified, including
frameshifts, splice site mutations, and point mutations. Two tumors had
an identical base substitution (a G-to-A transition) at the first base
of intron 4. Mutations were found more often in tumors with
microsatellite instability (MI+), implying that PTEN may constitute a
target for microsatellite instability. Furthermore, Kong et al. (1997)
suggested that the MI+ phenotype may predispose these tumors to simple
base-substitution mutations, as well as to the frameshift mutations that
are typical of microsatellite instability.

.0009
COWDEN DISEASE 1
PTEN, IVS6, T-G, +2

Olschwang et al. (1998) screened all 9 exons of PTEN by heteroduplex
analysis of leukocyte genomic DNA from patients considered to have
juvenile polyposis coli. In 1 patient, a T-to-G transversion at the
second position of the consensus splicing donor site of exon 6 was
found. This change was predicted to lead to a skipping of at least exon
6 in the processed mRNA, resulting in a shift of the translation reading
frame starting at codon 164 and leading to a stop codon at position 172.
The patient was a 14-year-old male who underwent colonoscopy that
revealed juvenile polyposis. He had no previous personal or family
history that could be related to either Cowden disease or
Bannayan-Zonana syndrome.

Eng and Peacocke (1998) suggested that this patient may have had Cowden
syndrome (158350) that had not yet 'declared itself' because of reduced
penetrance under 15 years of age. Waite and Eng (2002) reiterated the
conclusion of Eng and Peacocke (1998) that the individuals studied by
Olschwang et al. (1998) (see also 601728.0010 and 601728.0011) had
Cowden syndrome or Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome, and stated that
juvenile intestinal polyposis is not a so-called PTEN hamartoma-tumor
syndrome (PHTS). They suggested that the discovery of the germline PTEN
mutation in an individual considered to have JPS should raise a
suspicion that the clinical diagnosis is incorrect and that such an
individual should be managed medically in the same manner as all
patients with PHTS.

.0010
COWDEN DISEASE 1
PTEN, 1-BP DEL, 696A

In a patient considered to have juvenile polyposis coli, Olschwang et
al. (1998) identified a 1-bp deletion (A) at nucleotide 696, causing a
frameshift in exon 7 and leading to a stop codon at position 255. The
patient was 74 years old when he presented with severe anemia and
hypoalbuminemia. Gastroscopy and colonoscopy showed polyps throughout
the digestive tract, which were classified as juvenile by histology,
leading to the diagnosis of juvenile polyposis coli. Two years earlier,
this patient had developed laryngeal cancer that was treated by
radiotherapy only. This was thought to be related to heavy tobacco use
and alcohol consumption. The deletion in this patient involved
proline-232.

Eng and Peacocke (1998) interpreted features of this patient as highly
suggestive of Cowden syndrome (158350). Waite and Eng (2002) supported
this conclusion and stated that juvenile intestinal polyposis is not a
so-called PTEN hamartoma-tumor syndrome (PHTS). They suggested that the
discovery of the germline PTEN mutation in an individual considered to
have JPS should raise a suspicion that the clinical diagnosis is
incorrect and that such an individual should be managed medically in the
same manner as all patients with PHTS.

.0011
COWDEN DISEASE 1
PTEN, MET35ARG

In a patient considered to have juvenile polyposis coli, Olschwang et
al. (1998) identified a T-to-G transversion in exon 2 predicted to
substitute an arginine for the methionine at codon 35. The PTEN protein
demonstrates exceedingly high phylogenic conservation, with the human
protein identical to that of dog and differing from that of mouse by a
single amino acid change at codon 398. Codon 35 occurs in the region of
PTEN that presents significant homology with tensin (600076) and
auxilin. Taken together, these observations suggested that the DNA
variation in this patient was deleterious. The patient underwent
gastroscopy and colonoscopy at 7 years of age, after a 3-year history of
intermittent rectal bleeding. Juvenile polyps were found throughout the
stomach, duodenum, and colon. At the age of 10 years, clinical
evaluations had not revealed any extra-digestive manifestations that
could be associated with Cowden disease. Both parents underwent
colonoscopy that showed normal digestive tracts. The genotypes at 8
highly polymorphic microsatellite loci in the parents and patient
confirmed mendelian inheritance. Sequencing of exon 2 amplified from the
DNAs of both parents revealed only codon 35 for methionine,
demonstrating that codon 35 of arginine was a new mutation.

Eng and Peacocke (1998) pointed out that the penetrance of Cowden
syndrome (158350) is well under 10% below 15 years of age (Nelen et al.,
1996); thus children with JPS, according to diagnostic criteria, may
develop other features of Cowden syndrome as they age. Waite and Eng
(2002) supported this conclusion and stated that juvenile intestinal
polyposis is not a so-called PTEN hamartoma-tumor syndrome (PHTS). They
suggested that the discovery of the germline PTEN mutation in an
individual considered to have JPS should raise a suspicion that the
clinical diagnosis is incorrect and that such an individual should be
managed medically in the same manner as all patients with PHTS.

.0012
COWDEN DISEASE 1
PTEN, LEU70PRO

Marsh et al. (1998) studied 64 families with a Cowden syndrome-like
phenotype insufficient to make the diagnosis of Cowden syndrome
(158350). They found only 1 mutation, in a male with follicular
carcinoma. The mutation was a T-to-C transition at codon 209 of the PTEN
gene, resulting in a leu70-to-pro substitution predicted to affect
splicing.

.0013
BANNAYAN-RILEY-RUVALCABA SYNDROME
PTEN, 1-BP DEL, 1390C

In 3 affected members of a family with macrocephaly, multiple lipomas,
and hemangiomata (153480), Longy et al. (1998) identified a 1-bp
deletion (1390delC) in exon 6 of the PTEN gene, resulting in a
frameshift and premature truncation of the protein at codon 198. One
member of the family had features more suggestive of Cowden disease
(158350).

.0014
BANNAYAN-RILEY-RUVALCABA SYNDROME
PTEN, TYR178TER

Longy et al. (1998) reported a heterozygous pattern T/A for nucleotides
1338 and 1339 in exon 6 of the PTEN gene in affected members of a family
with macrocephaly, multiple lipomas, and hemangiomata (153480). They
interpreted this mutation as being due to a small inversion of these
nucleotides, resulting in a termination signal at codon 178 (Y178X).

.0015
BANNAYAN-RILEY-RUVALCABA SYNDROME
PTEN, GLN214TER

In a patient with macrocephaly, multiple lipomas, and hemangiomata
(153480), Longy et al. (1998) identified a heterozygous 144C-T
transition in exon 7 of the PTEN gene, resulting in a gln214-to-ter
(Q214X) substitution. Neither parent of the proband had evidence of the
mutation, suggesting that it was de novo.

.0016
BANNAYAN-RILEY-RUVALCABA SYNDROME
PTEN, GLU256TER

In a 2-year-old child with macrocephaly, multiple lipomas, and
hemangiomata (153480), Longy et al. (1998) identified a de novo 1570G-T
transversion in exon 7 of the PTEN gene, resulting in a glu256-to-ter
(E256X) substitution. The patient also had mild psychomotor retardation.

.0017
COWDEN DISEASE 1
PTEN, ARG130GLN

Kurose et al. (1999) described a heterozygous G-to-A transition at the
second nucleotide of codon 130 of the PTEN gene, predicted to result in
an arg130-to-gln (R130Q) substitution, in a 35-year-old Japanese man who
had been followed clinically for presumed JPS (174900) because of
numerous hamartomatous polypoid lesions throughout the digestive tract,
from esophagus to rectum. On further examination, he was found to have a
small thyroid adenoma and a few papillomatous papules on his right hand,
as well as a lung tumor which had not been fully characterized at the
time of report. Waite and Eng (2002) classified this patient as a case
of Cowden disease (158350) and referred to the patient's 'classic
cutaneous features.'

.0018
PROSTATE CANCER, SOMATIC
PTEN, 5-BP DEL, NT761

Cairns et al. (1997) found deletion of 10q23 in 23 of 80 prostate tumors
(176807). Homozygous deletion of the PTEN gene was implicated in 6 cases
by testing with new intragenic markers. Repeat sequence analysis of the
coding region of the PTEN and the intron/exon boundaries in the
remaining 17 prostate tumors with 10q LOH demonstrated 4 tumors with
somatic mutations. One of the mutations was a 5-bp deletion involving
nucleotides 761-765 in exon 7 and resulting in a frameshift. The
identification of the second 'hit' in 10 (43%) of 23 tumors with LOH at
10q23 established PTEN as a main inactivation target of 10q loss in
sporadic prostate cancer.

.0019
PROSTATE CANCER, SOMATIC
PTEN, 564T-A

In a sporadic prostate cancer, Cairns et al. (1997) found a T-to-A
transversion at nucleotide 564 in exon 6, predicted to result in a
change from TAT (tyr) to TAA (stop).

.0020
LHERMITTE-DUCLOS DISEASE
PTEN, LEU112PRO

In a patient with a severe form of Lhermitte-Duclos disease (158350),
Sutphen et al. (1999) identified a T-to-C transition at nucleotide 335
in the PTEN gene, resulting in a leu112-to-pro substitution. The
mutation occurred in exon 5, which has been proposed to be a hotspot for
PTEN germline mutations.

.0021
BANNAYAN-RILEY-RUVALCABA SYNDROME
COWDEN DISEASE 1, INCLUDED;;
PROTEUS-LIKE SYNDROME, INCLUDED
PTEN, ARG335TER

In affected members of a family with 2 females with phenotypic findings
of Cowden syndrome (158350) and 2 males with phenotypic findings of
Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome (153480), Celebi et al. (1999)
identified a heterozygous 1003C-T transition in the PTEN gene, resulting
in an arg335-to-ter (R335X) substitution. The mutation was not
identified in 30 alleles from unaffected, unrelated subjects.

Zhou et al. (2000) reported a boy with congenital hemihypertrophy,
epidermoid nevi, macrocephaly, lipomas, arteriovenous malformations, and
normal intellect. He was given the clinical diagnosis of 'Proteus-like'
syndrome because of phenotypic similarities to Proteus syndrome
(176920). Molecular analysis identified a heterozygous germline R335X
mutation, and a somatic R130X (601728.0007) mutation in a nevus, lipoma,
and arteriovenous malformation from the patient. The authors postulated
that the second hit, R130X, occurred early in embryonic development and
may even represent germline mosaicism. Thus, PTEN may be involved in
'Proteus-like' syndrome with its implications for cancer development in
the future. Five unrelated patients with classic Proteus syndrome had no
demonstrable mutations in PTEN. Cohen et al. (2003) disputed the
diagnosis of Proteus syndrome in the patient reported by Zhou et al.
(2000). Cohen et al. (2003) stated that some of the clinical features
were not consistent with classic Proteus syndrome and noted that the
term 'Proteus-like' syndrome is unhelpful and confounding.

Caux et al. (2007) suggested that the patient reported by Zhou et al.
(2000) had segmental exacerbation of Cowden syndrome due to somatic
mosaicism for a second PTEN mutation, and they suggested 'SOLAMEN
syndrome' as an acronym for segmental overgrowth, lipomatosis,
arteriovenous malformation, and epidermal nevus.

.0022
COWDEN DISEASE 1
PTEN, 1-BP INS, A

In a patient with numerous manifestations of Cowden disease (158350)
including fibroepithelial polyps and acanthosis nigricans, Raizis et al.
(2000) found a single adenine insertion in exon 1 of the PTEN gene
between position 40 and 41. The mutation results in a frameshift in
codon 14 with protein truncation 29 amino acids later. This mutation,
resulting in total disruption of the PTEN gene including the phosphatase
and 5-prime tensin domain, was reported to be the most 5-prime mutation
in the PTEN gene reported so far.

.0023
COWDEN DISEASE 1
PTEN, CYS124SER

Marsh et al. (1998) described germline mutations in Cowden syndrome
(158350) at the cys124 position and the gly129-to-glu (601728.0001)
mutation. Families with cys124 mutations appear to have multiorgan
involvement and a paucity of malignant breast disease.

Weng et al. (2001) stated that the cys124-to-ser (C124S) mutation
results in a phosphatase-dead protein, with neither lipid nor protein
phosphatase activity.

.0024
MALIGNANT MELANOMA, SOMATIC
PTEN, CYS211TER

Celebi et al. (2000) examined 21 metastatic melanoma samples and
identified a C-to-A transversion at nucleotide 633 in exon 6 of the PTEN
gene, resulting in a cys211-to-ter mutation.

.0025
MALIGNANT MELANOMA, SOMATIC
PTEN, ASP19ASN

Celebi et al. (2000) examined 21 metastatic melanoma samples and
identified a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 55 in exon 1 of the PTEN
gene, resulting in an asp19-to-asn mutation.

.0026
MALIGNANT MELANOMA, SOMATIC
PTEN, VAL217ILE

Celebi et al. (2000) examined 21 metastatic melanoma samples and
identified a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 649 in exon 7 of the PTEN
gene, resulting in a val217-to-ile mutation.

.0027
COWDEN DISEASE 1
PTEN, 1-BP DEL, 802G

Fackenthal et al. (2001) identified a 1-bp deletion in PTEN cDNA in a
male with Cowden syndrome (158350) who developed breast cancer at the
age of 41 years.

.0028
COWDEN DISEASE 1
PTEN, 5-BP DEL, NT347

Fackenthal et al. (2001) identified a 5-bp deletion in PTEN cDNA in a
family with Cowden syndrome (158350). One male member of this family
developed breast cancer at the age of 43 years and died at the age of 57
years.

.0029
GLIOMA SUSCEPTIBILITY 2
MENINGIOMA, INCLUDED
PTEN, ARG234GLN

Staal et al. (2002) described a 38-year-old male who presented with
focal seizures of the right arm and dysphasia in 1981. In 1985, he was
found to have a meningioma (607174), which was removed completely. A
low-grade glioma of the left frontal lobe was detected in 1990 and
operated on in 1993 with subsequent radiotherapy. The tumor was
classified as an anaplastic oligodendroglioma (GLM2; 613028). By 1998,
regrowth of the tumor had occurred and the diagnosis was again
anaplastic oligodendroglioma. In the patient, Staal et al. (2002)
identified a heterozygous germline G-to-A transition at nucleotide 701
in exon 7 of the PTEN gene, resulting in an arg234-to-gln (R234Q)
substitution, without loss of heterozygosity in tumor DNA. The mutant
PTEN protein was not capable of inducing apoptosis, induced increased
cell proliferation, and led to high constitutive protein kinase B (PKB,
or AKT1; 164730) activation, which could not be increased further by
stimulation with insulin. The patient did not show any of the clinical
signs of Cowden disease (CD; 158350) or other hereditary diseases
typically associated with PTEN germline mutations.

.0030
VATER ASSOCIATION WITH MACROCEPHALY AND VENTRICULOMEGALY
PTEN, HIS861ASP

Reardon et al. (2001) identified a de novo his61-to-asp (H61D) mutation
in a child with macrocephaly and features of VATER association (see
276950).

.0031
SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA, HEAD AND NECK, SOMATIC
PTEN, ALA121GLY

In a study of 52 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma tumor samples
(HNSCC; 275355), Poetsch et al. (2002) found a 362C-A transition in exon
5 of the PTEN gene, resulting in an ala121-to-gly (A121G) mutation, in 1
oropharyngeal and 1 laryngeal carcinoma.

.0032
PROTEUS-LIKE SYNDROME
PTEN HAMARTOMA TUMOR SYNDROME, INCLUDED
PTEN, 1-BP DEL, 507C

Smith et al. (2002) identified a de novo 1-bp deletion in exon 6 of the
PTEN gene, 507delC, resulting in a premature stop codon (TAA) 38
nucleotides downstream within exon 6, in a 16-month-old male with
features suggestive of a 'Proteus-like' syndrome (see 158350), including
a left-sided epidermal nevus following the lines of Blaschko, widespread
capillary venous malformation on his chest and abdomen, multiple
lipoblastomata, disproportionate overgrowth of the right leg, and a
progressive course. Smith et al. (2002) stated that there was clear
evidence of mosaicism in this patient, although a somatic PTEN mutation
was not identified in a biopsy of a skin lesion.

Cohen et al. (2003) disputed the diagnosis of Smith et al. (2002) and
stated that several features in the patient had never been observed in
Proteus syndrome, such as lipoblastomatosis, polypoid lesions of the
jejunum and colon, and true hemangioma. Cohen et al. (2003) proposed
that the patient reported by Smith et al. (2002) actually had a PTEN
hamartoma tumor syndrome.

.0033
COWDEN DISEASE 1
PTEN, -764A-G

In 9 of 97 Cowden syndrome (158350) patients without a PCR-detectable
PTEN mutation, Zhou et al. (2003) identified 10 heterozygous sequence
variants within the PTEN promoter region, none of which was found among
186 normal white control subjects (372 chromosomes). One of the 10
variants was a -764A-G transition, present in a patient who had breast
cancer but no thyroid cancer or uterine cancer. See also Teresi et al.
(2007).

.0034
COWDEN DISEASE 1
PTEN, -861G-T

Zhou et al. (2003) identified a -861G-T transversion in the promoter
region of the PTEN gene in a patient with Cowden syndrome (158350) who
had breast cancer and thyroid cancer, but not uterine cancer, and showed
multiorgan involvement, defined as at least 5 organs affected (Marsh et
al., 1998). See also Teresi et al. (2007).

.0035
BANNAYAN-RILEY-RUVALCABA SYNDROME
PTEN, DEL

In a patient with macrocephaly, multiple lipomas, and hemangiomata, also
known as Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome (153480), in whom no PTEN
mutation had been detectable by PCR, Zhou et al. (2003) identified
deletion of the entire PTEN gene.

.0036
PTEN HAMARTOMA TUMOR SYNDROME WITH GRANULAR CELL TUMOR
PTEN, 1-BP DEL, 179G

Marchese et al. (2003) described a patient with multiple granular cell
tumors and phenotypic findings of PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS)
in whom they identified a 1-bp deletion (179delG) in exon3 of the PTEN
gene, resulting in a termination sequence at codon 98. The mutation was
not found in the parents, and DNA from 2 granular cell tumors and from
peripheral blood of the patient showed no loss of heterozygosity. The
38-year-old Caucasian male patient, born of nonconsanguineous healthy
parents, was well until the age of 16 years when blurred vision led to
the diagnosis of choreoretinitis. At age 21, he underwent partial
resection of the thyroid gland for microfollicular and trabecular
adenoma. At the age of 22, a fibrous lesion was removed from the left
turbinate sinus, as well as 3 'cystic' lesions from the left hand, which
were shown to be granular cell tumors. At age 26, a parasellar
angiofibroma, which was thought to have caused an arteriovenous fistula
of the cavernous sinus, was removed. Cataract in the left eye was
removed at the age of 28 and in the right eye at the age of 34. Diffuse
gastroesophageal polyposis and multiple polyps in the rectum and sigmoid
were discovered at the age of 29 years. Colonoscopy revealed multiple
hyperplastic polyps (less than 100) in the descending colon sigmoid and
rectum, 1 of which was, however, a schwannoma of the intestinal mucosa.
A large polyp in the transverse colon was histologically interpreted as
a juvenile polyp. The patient had several facial papular lesions,
increased head circumference (63 cm), a left-convex scoliosis, and
penile lentigines. Marchese et al. (2003) noted that although many
features seen in this patient have been associated with PHTS (thyroid
lesions, GI hamartomas, macrocephaly, facial papules, penile lentigines,
bilateral juvenile cataracts), multiple granular cell tumors had not
been described previously in patients with PHTS.

MACROCEPHALY/AUTISM SYNDROME
PTEN, HIS93ARG

In a 4-year-old boy with macrocephaly and autistic behaviors (605309),
Butler et al. (2005) identified a heterozygous A-to-G transition in exon
4 of the PTEN gene, resulting in a his93-to-arg (H93R) substitution.
Preliminary protein analysis predicted an increase in the surface
accessibility of the protein. Neither parent carried the mutation, and
nonpaternity was excluded by microsatellite genotyping.

.0038
MACROCEPHALY/AUTISM SYNDROME
PTEN, ASP252GLY

In a 3.5-year-old boy with macrocephaly and pervasive developmental
disorder (605309), Butler et al. (2005) identified a heterozygous A-to-G
transition in exon 7 of the PTEN gene, resulting in an asp252-to-gly
(D252G) substitution. Preliminary protein analysis predicted an increase
in the surface accessibility of the protein. The mother did not have the
mutation, but the father was unavailable for mutation testing.

.0039
MACROCEPHALY/AUTISM SYNDROME
PTEN, PHE241SER

In a 2.5-year-old boy with macrocephaly and autistic behavior (605309),
Butler et al. (2005) identified a heterozygous T-to-C transition in exon
7 of the PTEN gene, resulting in a phe241-to-ser (F241S) substitution.
Preliminary protein analysis predicted a decrease in the surface
accessibility of the protein. The patient, who was adopted, had freckles
on his glans penis but no other cutaneous pigmentary or vascular
abnormalities, and there was no known family history of Cowden syndrome
(158350) or Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome (153480). The parents were
unavailable for mutation testing.

.0040
MACROCEPHALY/AUTISM SYNDROME
PTEN, 1-BP INS, 519T

In a 27-month-old girl with macrocephaly/autism syndrome (605309),
Herman et al. (2007) identified a de novo heterozygous 1-bp insertion
(519insT) in exon 6 of the PTEN gene, resulting in a frameshift and
premature truncation at codon 179.

.0041
PTEN HAMARTOMA TUMOR SYNDROME
PTEN, GLY132VAL

In a 4.5-year-old Turkish boy with verrucous epidermal nevus,
macrocephaly, progressive lipomatosis, and intestinal polyposis,
suggestive of PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome, Tekin et al. (2006)
identified heterozygosity for a germline 395G-T transversion in the PTEN
gene, resulting in a gly132-to-val (G132V) substitution. The mutation
was not found in either parent. Loss of heterozygosity for chromosome
10q23 markers in the PTEN region was shown in tissue from a lipoma. The
authors noted that the clinical presentation of this patient was similar
to that of a 16-month-old boy with congenital left-sided verrucoid
epidermal nevus, multiple lipoblastomas, and vascular anomalies in whom
Smith et al. (2002) identified a deletion in the PTEN gene
(601728.0032), but that limb overgrowth and asymmetry were absent in
their patient.

.0042
MACROCEPHALY/AUTISM SYNDROME
PTEN, THR167ASN

In an 8-year-old non-Hispanic white female diagnosed with autism
(605309), O'Roak et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous de novo
thr167-to-asn (T167N) mutation in the PTEN gene. The patient had very
low verbal IQ of 57, low nonverbal IQ of 77, and low adaptive score of
79. There was a history of speech delay with loss of words during
development. Head circumference was 56 cm (z score = 2.8).

.0043
MACROCEPHALY/AUTISM SYNDROME
PTEN, THR131ILE

In a 49-month-old non-Hispanic white male diagnosed with autism
(605309), O'Roak et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous de novo
thr131-to-ile (T131I) mutation in the PTEN gene. The patient had very
low verbal and nonverbal IQ scores of 55 and 50, respectively, with a
low adaptive score of 73. There was a history of speech delay and
possible non-febrile seizures; EEG was normal. Head circumference was
57.8 cm (z score = 4.7).

.0044
MACROCEPHALY/AUTISM SYNDROME
PTEN, 1-BP INS, A

In a 9-year-old non-Hispanic white male diagnosed with autism (605309),
O'Roak et al. (2012) identified heterozygous de novo insertion of 1
basepair (A) in the PTEN gene resulting in frameshift and premature
termination of the protein (Cys136MetfsX44). The patient had extremely
low verbal IQ (19), nonverbal IQ (33), and adaptive score (57). There
was a history of speech delay and loss of words during development; the
patient was nonverbal at the time of the report. Head circumference was
56 cm (z score = 2.0).

112262	TITLE *112262 BONE MORPHOGENETIC PROTEIN 4; BMP4
;;BONE MORPHOGENETIC PROTEIN 2B; BMP2B;;
BMP2B1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

BMP4 is a vital regulatory molecule that functions throughout
development in mesoderm induction, tooth development, limb formation,
bone induction, and fracture repair. BMP4 is a member of the BMP family
and transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFB1; 190180) superfamily of
secretory signaling molecules that play essential roles in embryonic
development (summary by Bakrania et al., 2008).

CLONING

Bakrania et al. (2008) stated that the BMP4 protein is 408 amino acids
long and consists of a TGFB1 propeptide domain and a TGFB domain that
forms an active dimer.

GENE STRUCTURE

The transcriptional unit of the human BMP4 gene is encoded by 5 exons
and spans approximately 7 kb (van den Wijngaard et al., 1996). The human
BMP4 gene has at least 2 functional promoters, which are used in a cell
type-specific manner.

Shore et al. (1998) determined that alternate first exons may be used
and that the first 2 exons are untranslated. The promoter region is
GC-rich and contains no obvious TATA or CAAT consensus sequences. Both
positive and negative transcriptional regulatory elements are contained
within the 5-prime flanking region.

Bakrania et al. (2008) stated that the BMP4 gene contains 4 exons. The
first 2 exons are noncoding.

MAPPING

Dickinson et al. (1990) demonstrated that in the mouse the Bmp2b1 gene
is located on chromosome 14 and maps to the same area as 'pug nose'
(pn). The mutation in that disorder may reside in the Bmp2b1 gene.
Arguing from homology of synteny, Dickinson et al. (1990) suggested that
the human BMP2B1 gene may be located on chromosome 14. Furthermore, they
suggested that a human homolog of the murine Bmp2b2 gene resides on the
X chromosome, as it does in the mouse. There is, however, no direct
evidence of a second BMP2B gene in the human (McAlpine, 1992).

By analysis of human/rodent somatic cell hybrids, Tabas et al. (1993)
assigned the BMP4 gene to human chromosome 14. Using fluorescence in
situ hybridization, van den Wijngaard et al. (1995) localized the BMP4
gene to 14q22-q23. By FISH, Shore et al. (1998) mapped the BMP4 gene to
chromosome 14q21, a region more centromeric than previously reported.

GENE FUNCTION

Shafritz et al. (1996) found overexpression of BMP4 in lymphoblastoid
cell lines from 26 of 32 patients with FOP (135100), but from only 1 of
12 normal subjects (P less than 0.001). Furthermore, BMP4 and its mRNA
were detected in the lymphoblastoid cell lines from a man with FOP and
his 3 affected children, but not from the children's unaffected mother.
Cosegregation of DNA markers for the BMP4 locus on chromosome 14 in the
rare families in which FOP is inherited would strengthen the candidacy
of BMP4, and the demonstration of mutations in the BMP4 gene, especially
in the promoter sequences, would be confirmatory.

In a series of expression studies in mouse, Tucker et al. (1998)
demonstrated that BMP4 activates the expression of Msx1 (142983),
leading to incisor tooth development. BMP4 inhibited expression of Barx1
(603260), which marks presumptive molar teeth, and limits expression to
the proximal, presumptive molar mesenchyme at embryonic day 10.
Fibroblast growth factor-8 (FGF8; 600483) stimulated Barx1 expression.
When BMP4 signaling in early development was inhibited by application of
exogenous noggin (NOG; 602991) protein, ectopic Barx1 expression
resulted in transformation of tooth identity from incisor to molar.

Dlx1 (600029) and Dlx2 (126255) are involved in the patterning of murine
dentition, since loss of these transcription factors results in early
developmental failure in upper molar teeth. Thomas et al. (2000) found
that Bmp4 was coexpressed with Dlx2 in distal oral epithelium and that
it regulated Dlx2 expression by planar signaling. They presented
evidence that Bmp4 and Fgf8 cooperate and regulate the strict expression
of Dlx2 in the epithelium and the mesenchyme in the first branchial arch
in developing mice.

Dooley et al. (2000) investigated the effect of BMP4 on androgen
production in a human ovarian theca-like tumor (HOTT) cell culture
model. BMP4 decreased forskolin-stimulated HOTT cell secretion of
androstenedione and 17-alphahydroxyprogesterone (17OHP) by 50% but
increased progesterone production 3-fold above forskolin treatment
alone. BMP4 markedly inhibited forskolin stimulation of CYP17 (609300)
expression but had little effect on 3-beta-HSD (see 109715), CYP11A1
(118485), or STAR (600617) protein levels. The authors identified the
presence of mRNA for 3 BMP receptors in the HOTT cells model: BMPR1A
(601299), BMPR1B (603248), and BMPR2 (600799). The authors concluded
that BMP4 inhibits HOTT cell expression of CYP17, leading to an
alteration of the steroidogenic pathway resulting in reduced
androstenedione accumulation and increased progesterone production. They
also noted that the effects of BMP4 seem similar to those caused by
activin (see 147290), another member of the transforming growth
factor-beta (TGFB; see 190180) superfamily of proteins.

In chick embryos, the first signs of left-right asymmetry are detected
in Hensen's node, essentially by left-sided Sonic hedgehog (SHH; 600725)
expression. After a gap of several hours, Shh induces polarized gene
activities in the left paraxial mesoderm. Monsoro-Burq and Le Douarin
(2001) showed that during this time period, Bmp4 signaling is necessary
and sufficient to maintain Shh asymmetry within the node. Shh and Bmp4
proteins negatively regulate each other's transcription, resulting in a
strict complementarity between these 2 gene patterns on each side of the
node. Noggin, which is present in the midline at this stage, limits Bmp4
spreading. Moreover, Bmp4 is downstream to activin signals and controls
Fgf8. Thus, the authors concluded that early Bmp4 signaling coordinates
left and right pathways in Hensen's node.

Chen et al. (2002) studied BMP4 gene transfer and osteoinduction by BMP4
using an adenoviral vector to transduce mouse myoblast cells. BMP4
expressed by transduced myoblasts was located in the cytoplasm, and the
differentiation pathway utilized by these cells was converted from a
myogenic to an osteogenic pathway. Injection of the adenoviral vector
carrying BMP4 into the hindlimb muscles of male athymic nude rats
resulted in new bone formation that could be visualized on x-ray films
as early as 3 weeks post injection. Histologic staining of bone tissue
revealed a typical remodeled bone structure.

Cheng et al. (2003) measured the ability of 14 human BMPs to induce
osteogenic transformation in a mouse pluripotential stem cell line, a
mouse mesenchymal stem cell line, and a mature human osteoblastic cell
line. Osteogenic activity was determined by measuring induction of
alkaline phosphatase (see 171760), osteocalcin (112260), and matrix
mineralization upon BMP stimulation. All BMPs except BMP3 (112263) and
BMP12 (604651) were able to stimulate alkaline phosphatase activity in
the mature osteoblasts. BMP4 was able to induce all markers of
osteoblast differentiation in pluripotential and mesenchymal stem cells;
however, BMP4 was a weaker inducer than BMP2 (112261), BMP6 (112266),
and BMP9 (GDF2; 605120).

Paez-Pereda et al. (2003) stated that there is little doubt that
estrogens and growth factors are involved in the control of lactotroph
cell proliferation in the pituitary and that the tumorigenic action of
estrogen in prolactinomas had been demonstrated by in vitro and clinical
evidence. Thus, the number of lactotroph cells increases during
pregnancy. Prolactinomas occur more frequently in women and increase in
size during pregnancy or estrogen treatment, and, at least in human
prolactinomas, estrogen receptor expression is positively related to
size. Paez-Pereda et al. (2003) reported a previously undescribed
mechanism for prolactinoma growth that involved BMP4, SMAD4 (600993),
and estrogens.

By in situ hybridization, Zhu et al. (2004) found overlapping expression
of Bmp4 and Nkx2.1 (600635) in embryonic mouse lung. They presented
evidence that Nkx2.1 activated Bmp4 transcription through 2 Nkx2.1
elements in each of the 2 Bmp4 promoters.

Haramis et al. (2004) used mouse models to demonstrate that BMP4
expression occurs exclusively in the intravillus mesenchyme of the
intestine. Villus epithelial cells respond to the BMP signal. Inhibition
of BMP signaling by transgenic expression of noggin results in the
formation of numerous ectopic crypt units perpendicular to the
crypt-villus axis. These changes phenocopy the intestinal histopathology
of patients with the cancer predisposition syndrome juvenile polyposis
(174900), including the frequent occurrence of intraepithelial
neoplasia. Many juvenile polyposis cases are known to harbor mutations
in BMP pathway genes. Haramis et al. (2004) concluded that their data
indicated that intestinal BMP signaling represses de novo crypt
formation and polyp growth.

The mouse C3H10T1/2 stem cell line can be induced to differentiate into
adipocytes by exposing proliferating cells to BMP4 during a specific
time window prior to induction of differentiation (Tang et al., 2004).
Bowers et al. (2006) identified a subclone of these cells, the A33 cell
line, that was committed to the adipocyte lineage. A33 cells expressed
and secreted Bmp4 during the critical time point in the proliferative
stage. Inhibition of Bmp4 activity by the addition of noggin at the
critical time blocked the ability of A33 cells to differentiate into
adipocytes.

Piccirillo et al. (2006) reported that bone morphogenetic proteins,
among which BMP4 elicits the strongest effect, trigger a significant
reduction in the stem-like, tumor-initiating precursors of human
glioblastomas. Transient in vitro exposure to BMP4 abolished the
capacity of transplanted glioblastoma cells to establish intracerebral
glioblastomas. Most importantly, in vivo delivery of BMP4 effectively
blocked the tumor growth and associated mortality that occurred in 100%
of mice after intracerebral grafting of human glioblastoma cells.
Piccirillo et al. (2006) demonstrated that BMPs activate their cognate
receptor BMPRs and trigger the SMAD signaling cascade in cells isolated
from human glioblastomas. This is followed by a reduction in
proliferation, and increased expression of markers of neural
differentiation, with no effect on cell viability. The concomitant
reduction in clonogenic ability, in the size of the CD133
(604365)-positive population, and in the growth kinetics of glioblastoma
cells indicated that BMP4 reduces the tumor-initiating cell pool of
glioblastomas. These findings showed that the BMP-BMPR signaling
system--which controls the activity of normal brainstem cells--may also
act as a key inhibitory regulator of tumor-initiating, stem-like cells
from glioblastomas and the results also identified BMP4 as a novel,
noncytotoxic therapeutic effector, which may be used to prevent growth
and recurrence of glioblastomas in humans.

Wordinger et al. (2007) studied the effects of altered BMP signaling on
intraocular pressure (IOP) in primary open angle glaucoma (POAG; see
137760). They found that the human trabecular meshwork (TM) synthesized
and secreted BMP4 as well as expressed the BMP receptor subtypes BMPR1
(see BMPR1A; 601299) and BMPR2 (600799). TM cells responded to exogenous
BMP4 by phosphorylating SMAD signaling proteins. Cultured human TM cells
treated with TGFB2 significantly increased fibronectin (FN; 135600)
levels, and BMP4 blocked this FN induction. There was significant
elevation of mRNA and protein levels of the BMP antagonist Gremlin
(GREM1; 603054) in glaucomatous TM cells. In addition, Gremlin was
present in human aqueous humor. Gremlin blocked the negative effect of
BMP4 on TGFB2 induction of FN. Addition of recombinant Gremlin to the
medium of ex vivo perfusion-cultured human eye anterior segments caused
the glaucoma phenotype of elevated IOP. Wordinger et al. (2007)
concluded that these results were consistent with the hypothesis that,
in POAG, elevated expression of Gremlin by TM cells inhibited BMP4
antagonism of TGFB2 and led to increased extracellular matrix deposition
and elevated IOP.

Using RT-PCR, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometric analyses, Cejalvo
et al. (2007) demonstrated that human thymus and cortical epithelial
cells produced BMP2 and BMP4 and that both thymocytes and thymic
epithelium expressed the molecular machinery to respond to these
proteins. The receptors BMPR1A and BMPR2 were mainly expressed by
cortical thymocytes, whereas BMPR1B was expressed in the majority of
thymocytes. BMP4 treatment of chimeric human-mouse fetal thymic organ
cultures seeded with CD34 (142230)-positive human thymic progenitors
resulted in reduced cell recovery and inhibition of differentiation of
CD4 (186940)/CD8 (see 186910) double-negative to double-positive stages.
Cejalvo et al. (2007) concluded that BMP2 and BMP4 have a role in human
T-cell differentiation.

A hair follicle cycles through anagen (growth), catagen (involution),
and telogen (resting) phases and then reenters the anagen phase. Plikus
et al. (2008) demonstrated that unexpected periodic expression of BMP2
and BMP4 in the dermis regulates the process of hair follicle
regeneration. This BMP cycle is out of phase with the WNT/beta catenin
cycle (see 116806), thus dividing the conventional telogen into new
functional phases: one refractory and the other competent for hair
regeneration, characterized by high and low BMP signaling, respectively.
Overexpression of noggin (602991), a BMP antagonist, in mouse skin
resulted in a markedly shortened refractory phase and faster propagation
of the regenerative wave. Transplantation of skin from this mutant onto
a wildtype host showed that follicles and donor and host can affect
their cycling behaviors mutually, with the outcome depending on the
equilibrium of BMP activity in the dermis. Administration of BMP4
protein caused the competent region to become refractory. The existence
of a substance termed 'chalone' had been proposed to explain the
phenomenon of telogen refractivity, which can inhibit anagen
development. Plikus et al. (2008) suggested that BMPs may be the
long-sought chalone postulated by classical experiments. Plikus et al.
(2008) concluded that, taken together, the results presented in this
study provided an example of hierarchical regulation of local organ stem
cell homeostasis by the interorgan macroenvironment. The expression of
Bmp2 in subcutaneous adipocytes indicates physiologic integration
between the 2 thermoregulatory organs.

Using in situ hybridization in human embryos, Bakrania et al. (2008)
authors demonstrated expression of BMP4 in optic vesicle, developing
lens, the diencephalic floor, consistent with a role in pituitary
development, and in the interdigital mesenchyme and the joint primordium
at the stage at which limb buds have formed and are starting to
differentiate into fingers. Because BMP4 interacts with hedgehog
signaling genes in animals, Bakrania et al. (2008) evaluated gene
expression in embryos and demonstrated cotemporal and cospatial
expression of BMP4 and hedgehog signaling genes.

Wang et al. (2008) demonstrated binding between human full-length
triple-helical type IV collagen (see 120130) and BMP4. Based on
experiments in Drosophila, Wang et al. (2008) predicted that a conserved
sequence in type IV collagen functions as a BMP-binding module, and that
type IV collagens affect BMP signaling during vertebrate development.

Limb development is regulated by epithelial-mesenchymal feedback loops
between sonic hedgehog (SHH; 600725) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)
signaling involving the bone morphogenetic protein antagonist Grem1. By
combining mouse molecular genetics with mathematical modeling, Benazet
et al. (2009) showed that BMP4 first initiates and SHH then propagates
epithelial-mesenchymal feedback signaling through differential
transcriptional regulation of Grem1 to control digit specification. This
switch occurs by linking a fast BMP4/GREM1 module to the slower
SHH/GREM1/FGF epithelial-mesenchymal feedback loop. This self-regulatory
signaling network results in robust regulation of distal limb
development that is able to compensate for variations by
interconnectivity among the 3 signaling pathways.

Wandzioch and Zaret (2009) investigated how BMP4, transforming growth
factor-beta (TGF-beta; 190180), and fibroblast growth factor signaling
pathways converge on the earliest genes that elicit pancreas and liver
induction in mouse embryos. These genes include ALB1 (103600), PROX1
(601546), HNF6 (604164), HNF1B (189907), and PDX1 (600733). The
inductive network was found to be dynamic; it changed within hours.
Different signals functioned in parallel to induce different early
genes, and 2 permutations of signals induced liver progenitor domains,
which revealed flexibility in cell programming. Also, the specification
of pancreas and liver progenitors was restricted by the TGF-beta
pathway.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Bakrania et al. (2008) considered BMP4 as a candidate gene for ocular
malformation and digit anomalies (MCOPS6; 607932) and screened 215
individuals with ocular defects, mainly microphthalmia, for cytogenetic
defects by chromosomal analysis, for gene deletions by multiplex
ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), and for mutations in the
BMP4 gene by direct sequencing. They identified 2 individuals with a
14q22-q23 deletion associated with anophthalmia-microphthalmia, 1 with
associated pituitary anomaly. Sequence analysis of the BMP4 gene
identified 2 mutations: a frameshift mutation (112262.0001) in a family
with anophthalmia-microphthalmia, retinal dystrophy, myopia, poly-
and/or syndactyly, and brain anomalies, and a missense mutation
(112262.0002) in an individual with anophthalmia-microphthalmia and
brain anomalies. The finding of expression of BMP4 in developing human
optic vesicle, retina and lens, pituitary region, and digits strongly
supported BMP4 as a causative gene for anophthalmia-microphthalmia with
pituitary abnormalities and digit anomalies. Bakrania et al. (2008) also
identified 4 cases, some of which had retinal dystrophy, with 'low
penetrant' mutations in both BMP4 and hedgehog signaling genes, namely,
Sonic hedgehog (SHH; 600725) or Patched (PTCH1; 601309). Bakrania et al.
(2008) concluded that BMP4 is a major gene for
anophthalmia-microphthalmia and/or retinal dystrophy and brain anomalies
and may be a candidate for myopia and poly/syndactyly. The finding of
low-penetrant variants of BMP4 and hedgehog signaling partners suggested
an interaction between the 2 pathways in humans.

Suzuki et al. (2009) identified mutations in the BMP4 gene (see, e.g.,
112262.0003-112262.0005 and 112262.0007) in patients with cleft lip and
cleft palate (OFC11; 600625). The parents, who also carried the
mutation, had subtle defects in the orbicularis oris muscle on
ultrasound. Overall, BMP4 mutations were identified in 1 of 30 patients
with microform clefts, 2 of 87 patients with subepithelial defects in
the orbicularis oris muscle, and 5 of 968 patients with overt cleft
lip/palate (CL/P). These results indicated that microforms and
subepithelial defects in the orbicularis oris muscle are part of the
spectrum of CL/P and should be considered during the clinical evaluation
of families with clefts.

Reis et al. (2011) analyzed the BMP4 coding region in 133 patients with
various ocular conditions, including 60 with clinical
anophthalmia/microphthalmia (34 syndromic), 38 with anterior segment
anomalies (including 3 patients with SHORT syndrome, 269880), 16 with
cataract, 4 with coloboma, 5 with high myopia, and 10 with other
disorders. In 1 patient with SHORT syndrome, they identified a
heterozygous 2.263-Mb deletion encompassing BMP4 and 13 other genes. In
3 probands with syndromic microphthalmia, they identified heterozygosity
for a 158-kb deletion involving only the BMP4 gene (112262.0006), a
nonsense mutation (R198X; 122262.0007), and a frameshift mutation
(112262.0008), respectively; the affected sister of the proband with the
frameshift mutation carried both the frameshift and a missense mutation
(H121R; 112262.0009).

ANIMAL MODEL

Connor (1996) speculated that transgenic mice with selective
overexpression of Bmp4 may serve as animal models of fibrodysplasia
ossificans progressiva (FOP; 135100) and may make it possible to
evaluate potential therapies directed at influencing the expression of
BMP4 or its 2 types of cell-surface receptors. Not only may this
knowledge provide a rational basis for therapy for FOP, but possibly
also measures for the control of local ectopic bone development, which
occurs in 10 to 20% of patients who have undergone surgical hip
replacement. According to Connor (1996), there appears to be an
individual propensity to the phenomenon of secondary ectopic
ossification of soft tissue. In the 10 to 20% of patients who develop
local ectopic bone formation after hip replacement, if surgical removal
of that bone is attempted or the opposite hip is replaced, ectopic bone
almost invariably recurs or occurs.

Furuta and Hogan, (1998) showed that Bmp4, which is expressed strongly
in the mouse optic vesicle and weakly in surrounding mesenchyme and
surface ectoderm, plays a crucial role in lens induction. In Bmp4-null
mouse embryos, lens induction was absent but could be rescued by
exogenous BMP4 protein applied into the optic vesicle in explant
cultures. In Bmp4-null embryos, Msx2 (123101) expression was absent, and
expression mutant eye explants was rescued by BMP4-carrying beads,
suggesting that BMP4 functions to regulate specific gene expression in
the optic vesicle. No change in Pax6 (607108) was detected in Bmp4-null
eyes.

Using a hypomorphic Bmp4 allele and conditional gene inactivation, Jiao
et al. (2003) circumvented the early lethality of Bmp4 null mouse
embryos and manipulated Bmp4 expression specifically in developing
cardiomyocytes. They found that Bmp4 was dispensable for cushion
formation but was required for proper atrioventricular septation after
cushions had formed. Defects in septation caused atrioventricular canal
defects (AVCD; 600309) that recapitulated the range of AVCDs diagnosed
in patients.

Kan et al. (2004) generated mice overexpressing BMP4 under the control
of the neuron-specific enolase promoter (ENO2; 131360) and observed the
development of progressive postnatal heterotopic endochondral
ossification, a phenotype that matches the anatomic, spatial, and
temporal characteristics of human FOP. The phenotype was completely
rescued in double-transgenic mice that also overexpressed the BMP4
inhibitor noggin, confirming the role of BMP4 in the pathogenesis of the
disease.

Liu et al. (2005) demonstrated that mice with conditional inactivation
of the Bmpr1a gene in the facial primordia developed completely
penetrant, bilateral cleft lip/palate (119530) with arrested tooth
formation. The cleft secondary palate of Bmpr1a-mutant embryos was
associated with diminished cell proliferation in maxillary process
mesenchyme and defective anterior posterior patterning. In contrast, the
mutant mice showed elevated apoptosis in the fusing lip region of the
medial nasal process. Conditional inactivation of the Bmp4 gene resulted
in delayed fusion of the medial nasal process to form the lip, resulting
in isolated cleft lip in all mouse embryos at 12 days after conception.
However, cleft lip was only present in 22% of mouse embryos at 14.5 days
after conception, indicating spontaneous repair of cleft lip in utero
(see 600625). The findings implicated a BMP4-BMPR1A genetic pathway that
functions in lip fusion, and revealed that BMP signaling has distinct
roles in lip and palate fusion.

Fuller et al. (2007) found that Bmp4 and Bmp7 (112267) increased rapidly
at the site of chemically-induced demyelinating lesions in adult rat
spinal cord. The Bmp proteins stimulated Smad (see, e.g., SMAD1; 601595)
activation in mature astrocytes, resulting in increased expression of
chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans and glial scar formation.

Goldman et al. (2009) used Bmp4-hypomorphic mice to investigate the
regulation of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function and the maintenance
of steady-state hematopoiesis in adults. Reporter gene analysis showed
that Bmp4 was expressed in osteoblasts, endothelial cells, and
megakaryocytes. Resting hematopoiesis was normal in Bmp4-deficient mice,
but cells expressing Kit (164920) and Sca1 (also known as Ly6a, a
mouse-specific gene) were significantly reduced. Serial transplantation
revealed that Bmp4-deficient recipients had a microenvironmental defect
that reduced the repopulating activity of wildtype HSCs. When wildtype
HSCs did engraft in Bmp4-deficient bone marrow, they showed a marked
decrease in functional stem cell activity. Goldman et al. (2009)
concluded that BMP4 is a critical component of the hematopoietic
microenvironment and is involved in regulating HSC number and function.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MICROPHTHALMIA, SYNDROMIC 6
BMP4, 2-BP DEL, 226AG

Bakrania et al. (2008) described a kindred in which members of 3
generations had eye, brain, and digit developmental anomalies (MCOPS6;
607932) related to a frameshift mutation in the BMP4 gene (222del2AG,
S76fs104X). The proband had clinical anophthalmia with no light
perception on the right; the left eye showed microcornea, coloboma,
retinal dystrophy, and tilted optic disc. He had mild learning
difficulties and polydactyly. Cranial MRI showed enlarged trigones,
hypoplastic corpus callosum, and sulcal widening. The maternal
grandmother, who carried the same mutation, showed on MRI enlarged
ventricles, hypoplastic corpus callosum, and marked sulcal widening
associated with diffuse brain atrophy; additionally, she had polydactyly
and finger webbing.

.0002
MICROPHTHALMIA, SYNDROMIC 6
BMP4, GLU93GLY

In a patient with eye, brain, and digit developmental anomalies (MCOPS6;
607932), Bakrania et al. (2008) identified a 278A-G transition in the
BMP4 gene that resulted in a glu93-to-gly substitution (E93G). The right
eye of the patient showed microphthalmia, sclerocornea, and orbital
cyst; the left eye showed microphthalmia, coloboma, and microcornea.
Cranial MRI showed delayed myelination and mild reduction in white
matter. The proband had developmental delay, seizures, undescended
testes, simple prominent ears, broad hands, low-placed thumbs, and
dysplastic nails.

.0003
OROFACIAL CLEFT 11
BMP4, ALA346VAL

In a child with a microform cleft lip and cleft palate (OFC11; 600625),
Suzuki et al. (2009) identified a heterozygous 1037C-T transition in the
BMP4 gene, resulting in an ala346-to-val (A346V) substitution. His
father, who also carried the mutation, had subtle right microform cleft
lip and a bifid uvula. The microform cleft lip was confirmed by
ultrasound, which detected defects in the orbicularis oris muscle in
both patients.

.0004
OROFACIAL CLEFT 11
BMP4, SER91CYS

In a child with a cleft lip and cleft palate (OFC11; 600625), Suzuki et
al. (2009) identified a heterozygous 271A-T transversion in the BMP4
gene, resulting in a ser91-to-cys (S91C) substitution. The child's
parent, who also carried the mutation, had defects of the orbicularis
oris muscle on ultrasonography.

.0005
OROFACIAL CLEFT 11
BMP4, ARG287HIS

In a child with a cleft lip and cleft palate (OFC11; 600625), Suzuki et
al. (2009) identified a heterozygous 860G-A transition in the BMP4 gene,
resulting in an arg287-to-his (R287H) substitution. The child's parent,
who also carried the mutation, had defects of the orbicularis oris
muscle on ultrasonography.

.0006
MICROPHTHALMIA, SYNDROMIC 6
BMP4, DEL

In a 12-year-old Caucasian girl with bilateral microphthalmia and other
eye anomalies, facial dysmorphism, cognitive impairment, and a history
of hypotonia (MCOPS6; 607932), Reis et al. (2011) identified
heterozygosity for a 158-kb deletion on chromosome 14q22.2, with a
minimum interval chr14:53,361,728-53,520,165 and a maximum interval
chr14:53,352,059-53,520,859 (NCBI36), deleting only the BMP4 gene. In
addition to bilateral microphthalmia, the patient had bilateral
persistence of the pupillary membrane, high myopia, strabismus, and
nystagmus. Her dysmorphic facial features included maxillary hypoplasia
with midface flattening, thin upper lip, broad nasal bridge and tip, and
telecanthus, with a preauricular ear tag on the right. She had normal
growth, head circumference, umbilicus, hands, and feet. The patient was
adopted, and no family members were available for study.

.0007
OROFACIAL CLEFT 11
MICROPHTHALMIA, SYNDROMIC 6, INCLUDED
BMP4, ARG198TER

In a Mongolian patient with cleft lip and palate (OFC11; 600625), Suzuki
et al. (2009) identified heterozygosity for a 592C-T transition in exon
4 of the BMP4 gene, resulting in an arg198-to-ter (R198X) substitution.
The parents were unavailable for testing.

In a 19-month-old boy with right clinical anophthalmia and left
microphthalmia, sclerocornea, facial asymmetry, and right-sided
diaphragmatic hernia (MCOPS6; 607932), Reis et al. (2011) identified
heterozygosity for the R198X mutation in BMP4. The boy also had mild to
moderate laryngomalacia, with indentation from the innominate artery,
and bilateral inguinal hernias. He was macrocephalic with a large
anterior fontanel, and had hydrocephalus that was treated with a large
subdural-peritoneal shunt. Brain MRI at 4 months of age confirmed the
ocular findings and showed macrocrania with very prominent subarachnoid
spaces, superimposed overlying subdural collections, as well as diffuse
cerebral atrophy with ventricular prominence. The mutation was not found
in 179 Caucasian, 89 African American, 91 Asian, and 93 Hispanic
controls.

.0008
MICROPHTHALMIA, SYNDROMIC 6
BMP4, 1-BP DUP, 171C

In a 3.5-year-old Caucasian girl with bilateral clinical anophthalmia,
small ears, and small left renal cyst (MCOPS6; 607932), Reis et al.
(2011) identified heterozygosity for a 1-bp duplication (171dupC) in
exon 2 of the BMP4 gene, predicted to cause a frameshift and premature
termination. The proband had normal development, without craniofacial
dysmorphism or anomalies of the hands or feet. Head CT in the neonatal
period showed significantly small globes, minimal ocular tissue, and
absent optic nerves, but otherwise normal brain structures. Her affected
9-year-old maternal half sister was found to be compound heterozygous
for 171dupC and a 362A-G transition in exon 2 of BMP4, resulting in a
his121-to-arg (H121R; 112262.0009) substitution at a conserved residue.
The sister had unilateral clinical anophthalmia, blepharophimosis,
telecanthus, and bilateral postaxial polydactyly of the hands. She had
poor growth, with height and weight less than the third centile, and
relative macrocephaly with frontal bossing. Head CT showed atrophic left
globe and small left orbit. Their asymptomatic mother was heterozygous
for the frameshift mutation, with no evidence of mosaicism; the mutation
was apparently de novo, as the maternal grandparents carried wildtype
BMP4 alleles. The mother was unavailable for examination, so mild ocular
anomalies could not be ruled out, and the father was also unavailable
for study. Neither mutation was found in 179 Caucasian, 89 African
American, 91 Asian, and 93 Hispanic controls.

600172	TITLE *600172 METAL-REGULATORY TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 1; MTF1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The metallothioneins are small cysteine-rich proteins that bind heavy
metal ions such as zinc, cadmium, and copper with high affinity, and
have been functionally implicated in heavy metal detoxification and
radical scavenging. Transcription of metallothionein genes is induced by
exposure of cells to heavy metals. This induction is mediated by
metal-responsive promoter elements (MREs). Westin and Schaffner (1988)
and Radtke et al. (1993) cloned a mouse transcription factor, designated
Mtf-1, that binds to these metal-responsive promoter elements. Brugnera
et al. (1994) cloned the human counterpart of the mouse gene. The human
protein has 753 amino acids with 93% amino acid sequence identity to the
mouse protein and has an extension of 78 amino acids at the C terminus
without counterpart in the mouse. In the 2 species the factor has the
same overall structure, including 6 zinc fingers in the DNA binding
domain.

GENE FUNCTION

Brugnera et al. (1994) found that, in transfected cells, the human MTF1
gene mediated a more pronounced metal response of a reporter gene than
did the mouse factor, indicating that it is critically involved in zinc
induction of metallothionein genes.

Selvaraj et al. (2005) found that copper depletion in Drosophila
resulted in Mtf1-mediated activation of Ctr1b, which encodes a copper
importer. Activation depended on the same type of upstream MRE motifs as
are normally required for metal induction during copper toxicity.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Brugnera et al. (1994) mapped the
MTF1 gene to 1p34-p32, with 1p33 as the most likely location.

ANIMAL MODEL

Gunes et al. (1998) generated mice deficient in MTF1 by targeted
disruption. Embryos lacking MTF1 died in utero at approximately day 14
of gestation. They showed impaired development of hepatocytes and, at
later stages, liver decay and generalized edema. Mtf1 -/- embryos failed
to transcribe metallothionein I and II genes, and also showed diminished
transcripts of the gene which encodes the heavy-chain subunit of the
gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase, a key enzyme for glutathione
biosynthesis. Metallothionein and glutathione are involved in heavy
metal homeostasis and detoxification processes, such as scavenging
reactive oxygen intermediates. Accordingly, primary mouse embryo
fibroblasts lacking MTF1 show increased susceptibility to the cytotoxic
effects of cadmium or hydrogen peroxide. Thus, Gunes et al. (1998)
concluded that MTF1 may help to control metal homeostasis and probably
cellular redox state, especially during liver development. They also
noted that the Mtf1-null mutant phenotype bears some similarity to those
of 2 other regulators of cellular stress response, namely c-jun and
NF-kappa-B (NFKB3; 164014).

606625	TITLE *606625 SLAM FAMILY, MEMBER 7; SLAMF7
;;CD2-LIKE RECEPTOR ACTIVATING CYTOTOXIC CELLS; CRACC;;
CS1
DESCRIPTION Natural killer (NK)-cell function is regulated by a balance between
signaling through inhibitory (e.g., KIR2DL1; 604936) and activating
receptors. Some members of the CD2 (186990) family of activating
receptors (e.g., CD244; 605554) stimulate cytotoxicity through the SLAM
(603492)-associated protein (SAP; 300490). Mutations in the SH2 domain
of SAP cause deficiencies in other CD2 family proteins that transduce
signals through SAP, and these deficiencies lead to uncontrolled
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infections and, ultimately, to X-linked
lymphoproliferative disease (XLPD; 308240).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences encoding the TxYxxI/V/A
tyrosine motif found in CD244 and SLAM, followed by PCR on an NK-cell
cDNA library and library screening, Boles and Mathew (2001) isolated a
cDNA encoding CS1 (CD2 subset 1). Sequence analysis predicted that the
335-amino acid transmembrane protein has a 225-residue extracellular
domain, which has 7 putative N-linked glycosylation sites, and an
85-amino acid cytoplasmic domain, which contains 2 of the consensus
tyrosine motifs and a third C-terminal tyrosine motif that has phe
instead of thr. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a 3.0-kb
CS1 transcript that was highest in spleen, lymph node, and peripheral
blood leukocytes and lowest in bone marrow. Expression was detected in
an NK-cell line but not in promyelocytic, B-, or T-cell lines.

Bouchon et al. (2001) also cloned CS1, which they termed CRACC. They
noted the presence of 2 CD2-like Ig folds in the extracellular domain of
CRACC. RT-PCR analysis detected CRACC expression in NK and CD8 (see
186910)-positive cytotoxic cells. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated
expression of CRACC on nearly all NK cells, a large subset of CD8 cells,
and few CD4 (186940) cells and B cells. Expression on B cells was
upregulated upon CD40 (109535) activation, and expression on dendritic
cells was upregulated by influenza virus, lipopolysaccharide, and CD40L
(300386). Immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE analyses showed expression of
a 66-kD protein and, after deglycosylation, a 37-kD protein. Functional
analysis indicated that CRACC mediates lysis that is in addition to that
mediated by NKP46 (604530) or CD16 (146740). Further analysis determined
that, unlike CD244, cytotoxicity mediated by CRACC or NKP46 is
SAP-independent and that CRACC triggers ERK (see 601335) activation.
Immunoblot analysis showed that CRACC is tyrosine phosphorylated in
activated NK cells and is associated with 19- and 39-kD proteins.
Bouchon et al. (2001) proposed that CRACC may be particularly important
in controlling pathogens other than EBV.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Boles and Mathew (2001) determined that
the CS1 gene spans 13 kb, with a relatively small (8.7 kb) intron 1
compared with the 17-kb intron 1 of the CD244 gene.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Boles and Mathew (2001) and Bouchon et al.
(2001) mapped the CS1 gene to chromosome 1q23-q24, between the CD48
(109530) and CD229 (LY9; 600684) genes.

605240	TITLE *605240 CHEMOKINE, CC MOTIF, LIGAND 28; CCL28
DESCRIPTION For background information on chemokines, see CCL27 (SCYA27; 604833).

CLONING

By searching an EST database using a consensus chemokine sequence, Wang
et al. (2000) identified ESTs encoding CCL28. Sequence analysis
predicted that the 127-amino acid CCL28 protein contains a 22-amino acid
N-terminal signal peptide. Northern blot analysis detected 0.8-, 1.3-,
and 6.0-kb CCL28 transcripts predominantly in prostate, colon, spleen,
and to a lesser degree in peripheral blood leukocytes.
Immunohistochemical analysis detected CCL28 expression in epithelial
cells of normal colon. Quantitative PCR analysis demonstrated high
expression of CCL28 in cDNA libraries derived from organs where
epithelial cells are localized, including samples from ulcerative
colitis (see 266600) tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Functional analysis by Wang et al. (2000) showed that CCL28 is
chemotactic for resting CD4 (186940) and CD8 (see 186910) T cells and
fails to mobilize calcium in cells expressing known CC chemokine
receptors (CCRs, e.g., CCR9; 604738) or CXC chemokine receptors (CXCRs,
e.g., BLR1; 601613). Wang et al. (2000) determined that CCL28 does
mobilize calcium in cells expressing CCR10 (GPR2; 600240), which it
shares with the skin chemokine, CCL27.

Wilson and Butcher (2004) found that Ccl28 was upregulated in mouse
mammary gland during lactation and that IgA antibody-secreting cells
(ASCs) in the gland expressed Ccr10 and migrated to Ccl28. Antibody to
Ccl28 blocked IgA ASC accumulation in mammary gland, inhibiting
secretion of IgA into milk and the appearance of antibody in the
gastrointestinal tract of nursing neonatal mice. Wilson and Butcher
(2004) proposed that CCL28 is a key regulator of IgA ASC accumulation in
the mammary gland and thereby controls passive transfer of IgA
antibodies from mother to infant.

Facciabene et al. (2011) showed that tumor hypoxia promotes the
recruitment of regulatory T (Treg) cells through induction of expression
of the chemokine CCL28, which in turn promotes tumor tolerance and
angiogenesis. Facciabene et al. (2011) concluded that peripheral immune
tolerance and angiogenesis programs are closely connected and cooperate
to sustain tumor growth.

MAPPING

Wang et al. (2000) mapped the mouse Ccl28 gene to the distal region of
chromosome 13, which shows homology of synteny to human 5q. The authors
noted that this localization would place CCL28 outside the CCL cluster
in chromosome 17. Scott (2000) mapped the CCL28 gene to chromosome 5
based on sequence similarity between the CCL28 sequence (GenBank GENBANK
AF220210) and the chromosome 5 clones CTD-2202K16 (GenBank GENBANK
AC025457), CTD-2282F8 (GenBank GENBANK AC010465), and CTD-2201J22
(GenBank GENBANK AC022132).

602170	TITLE *602170 MYELOID DIFFERENTIATION PRIMARY RESPONSE GENE 88; MYD88
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MyD88 is a key downstream adapter for most Toll-like receptors (TLRs)
and interleukin-1 receptors (IL1Rs) (summary by Von Bernuth et al.,
2008).

CLONING

The myeloid differentiation (MyD) marker MyD88 was first characterized
during a study of the early genetic responses of murine myeloid cells to
various differentiation and growth inhibitory stimuli (Lord et al.,
1990). Myeloid differentiation primary response genes are activated in
M1 myeloleukemic cells in response to interleukin-6 (IL6; 147620), which
induces both growth arrest and terminal differentiation. Hardiman et al.
(1997) described the cloning of the mouse MyD88 gene. The first exon
encodes a complete 'death domain' similar to the intracellular segment
of TNF receptor-1 (191190). Zoo-blot analysis demonstrated that it is an
evolutionarily conserved gene. Northern blot analysis revealed
widespread expression of the gene in many adult mouse tissues, and
RT-PCR detected MyD88 mRNA in T- and B-cell lines and differentiating
embryonic stem cells. The broad expression pattern demonstrated that
mouse Myd88 expression is not restricted to cells of myeloid lineage as
was originally believed.

Bonnert et al. (1997) cloned a human MYD88 cDNA that encodes a 296-amino
acid polypeptide with a predicted mass of 33 kD. MYD88 shares 81% amino
acid identity with murine MyD88. The 150-amino acid C-terminal region
has significant homology to the type I interleukin-1 receptor (147810)
cytoplasmic domain. Northern blot analysis revealed that human MYD88 is
expressed as 2 MYD88 hybridizing 1.6- and 3-kb mRNAs in a variety of
tissues and cell lines.

Using immunofluorescence analysis, Kagan and Medzhitov (2006) found that
human MYD88 localized to discrete foci scattered throughout the cytosol
of transfected mouse embryonic fibroblasts and macrophages.

GENE FUNCTION

Bonnert et al. (1997) found that overexpression of MYD88 caused an
increase in the level of transcription from the interleukin-8 (146930)
promoter.

Muzio et al. (1997) reported that the C-terminal domain of MYD88 has
significant sequence similarity to the cytoplasmic domain of IL1RAP
(602626). They showed that ectopic expression of MYD88 strongly induced
NFKB (e.g., 164011) activity in a concentration-dependent manner. In
addition, the C-terminal region of MYD88 acted as a dominant-negative
inhibitor of IL1R1 (147810)/IL1RAP-induced NFKB activity. MYD88 formed
an immunoprecipitable complex with IL1RAP and with IRAK2 (603304).

Medzhitov et al. (1998) demonstrated that signaling by the human TOLL
receptor (see TLR4; 603030) employs an adaptor protein, MyD88, and
induces activation of NFKB via the IRAK (IRAK1; 300283) kinase and the
TRAF6 (602355) protein. The Toll-mediated signaling cascade using the
NFKB pathway is essential for immune responses in adult Drosophila, and
a human homolog of the Drosophila Toll protein induces various immune
response genes via this pathway. These findings implicate MyD88 as a
general adaptor/regulator molecule for the Toll/IL1R family of receptors
for innate immunity.

Hayashi et al. (2001) showed that expression of TLR5 (603031) induces
NFKB (see 164011) activation and TNFA (191160) production.
Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) known to stimulate other
TLR family members failed to stimulate TLR5; however, luciferase
reporter assays indicated TLR5 activation in gram-positive and -negative
bacterial culture supernatants. By fractionation of Listeria culture
supernatants followed by SDS-PAGE, Hayashi et al. (2001) identified
flagellin as the TLR5 ligand. Flagellin, a principal component of
bacterial flagella, is a virulence factor recognized by the innate
immune system in plants, insects, and mammals. Expression of flagellin
in nonflagellated bacteria resulted in TLR5 activation, and deletion of
flagellin from flagellated bacteria abrogated TLR5 activation. Hayashi
et al. (2001) demonstrated that injection of flagellin induces the
production of IL6 (147620) in wildtype mice, but not in those lacking
the MyD88 adaptor protein, required for TLR signaling. Hayashi et al.
(2001) concluded that TLR5 is a pattern-recognition receptor and that
its PAMP is flagellin, a protein with conserved N and C termini in a
broad group of motile pathogens.

Burns et al. (2003) noted that a MYD88 splice variant encodes a protein,
MYD88s, lacking the 58-amino acid intermediary domain between the death
domain and the C-terminal TIR domain. MYD88s is detected only after
continuous stimulation with bacterial products, such as
lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or proinflammatory cytokines. Expression of
MYD88s blocks LPS- or IL1-induced NFKB activation, even though, like the
full-length protein, MYD88s binds both IL1R and IRAK1. By Western blot
analysis of a reconstituted MYD88 -/- cell line, Burns et al. (2003)
showed that MYD88, but not MYD88s, triggered IRAK1 phosphorylation and
NFKB activation in an IRAK4 (606883)-dependent manner. MYD88s did not
bind IRAK4 and blocked its recruitment to IL1Rs. Burns et al. (2003)
concluded that MYD88s acts as a negative regulator of IL1R/TLR/MYD88
signals, leading to a controlled negative regulation of innate immune
responses.

Diebold et al. (2004) confirmed that mouse plasmacytoid dendritic cells
(PDCs) expressing B220 (PTPRC; 151460) but not Cd11b (ITGAM; 120980)
were resistant to suppression of Ifna (147660) production mediated by
influenza virus NS1 protein, suggesting that PDCs use a
dsRNA-independent pathway for recognizing influenza. Chloroquine
inhibited influenza-induced Ifna production, indicating that recognition
of the virus occurs in the endosomal compartment. Ifna production in
response to live or inactivated influenza virus or to viral genomic or
host ssRNA required the presence of Myd88 and Tlr7 (300365), but not
other TLRs.

Kagan and Medzhitov (2006) found that human TIRAP (606252), a TLR
adaptor protein, recruited human MYD88 to the plasma membrane of
transfected mouse fibroblasts and macrophages. They proposed that TIRAP
functions primarily to recruit MYD88 to activated TLR4 to initiate
signal transduction.

Chen et al. (2007) found that the acute neutrophilic inflammatory
response to cell injury requires the signaling protein Myd88. Analysis
of the contribution of Myd88-dependent receptors to this response
revealed only a minor reduction in mice doubly deficient in Toll-like
receptor-2 (Tlr2; 603028) and Tlr4 (603030) and normal responses in mice
lacking Tlr1 (601194), Tlr3 (603029), Tlr6 (605403), Tlr7 (300365), Tlr9
(605474), or Tlr11 (606270) or the IL18 receptor (IL18R; 604494).
However, mice lacking IL1R (147810) showed a markedly reduced
neutrophilic inflammatory response to dead cells and tissue injury in
vivo as well as greatly decreased collateral damage from inflammation.
This inflammatory response required IL1-alpha (147760), and IL1R
function was required on non-bone-marrow-derived cells. Notably, the
acute monocyte response to cell death, which is thought to be important
for tissue repair, was much less dependent on the IL1R-Myd88 pathway.
Also, this pathway was not required for the neutrophil response to a
microbial stimulus. These findings suggested that inhibiting the
IL1R-MYD88 pathway in vivo could block the damage from acute
inflammation that occurs in response to sterile cell death, and do so in
a way that might not compromise tissue repair or host defense against
pathogens.

Cirl et al. (2008) showed that virulent bacteria, such as uropathogenic
E. coli and Brucella melitensis, secreted inhibitory homologs of TIR
domain-containing proteins (TCPs). These TCPs promoted intracellular
bacterial survival and kidney pathology after instillation of organisms
in mouse bladder. Bacterial TCPs impeded TLR signaling through MYD88 and
impaired innate host defense. Molecular epidemiologic analysis of
clinical isolates from patients with urinary tract infections further
supported the proposal that bacterial TCPs represent a class of
virulence factors.

Alu RNA accumulation due to DICER1 (606241) deficiency in retinal
pigmented epithelium (RPE) is implicated in geographic atrophy, an
advanced form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD; see 603075).
Using mouse and human RPE cells and mice lacking various genes, Tarallo
et al. (2012) showed that a DICER1 deficit or Alu RNA exposure activated
the NLRP3 (606416) inflammasome, triggering TLR-independent MYD88
signaling via IL18 (600953) in the RPE. Inhibition of inflammasome
components, MYD88, or IL18 prevented RPE degeneration induced by DICER1
loss or Alu RNA exposure. Because RPE in human geographic atrophy
contained elevated NLRP3, PYCARD, and IL18, Tarallo et al. (2012)
suggested targeting this pathway for prevention and/or treatment of
geographic atrophy.

Zhu et al. (2012) showed that the direct, immediate, and disruptive
effects of IL1-beta (IL1B; 147720) on endothelial stability in a human
in vitro cell model are NF-kappa-B (see 164011)-independent and are
instead the result of signaling through the small GTPase
ADP-ribosylation factor-6 (ARF6; 600464) and its activator ARF
nucleotide-binding site opener (ARNO; 602488). Moreover, Zhu et al.
(2012) showed that ARNO binds directly to the adaptor protein MYD88, and
thus proposed MYD88-ARNO-ARF6 as a proximal IL1-beta signaling pathway
distinct from that mediated by NF-kappa-B. Finally, Zhu et al. (2012)
showed that SecinH3 (182115), an inhibitor of ARF guanine nucleotide
exchange factors such as ARNO, enhances vascular stability and
significantly improves outcomes in animal models of inflammatory
arthritis and acute inflammation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hardiman et al. (1997) described the gene structure of the mouse MyD88
gene. The complete coding sequence spans 5 exons.

Bonnert et al. (1997) found that the human MYD88 gene is encoded by 5
exons.

MAPPING

By interspecific backcross mapping, Hardiman et al. (1997) localized the
mouse MyD88 gene to chromosome 9; the human homolog was mapped to
3p22-p21.3 by PCR analysis of a chromosome 3 somatic cell hybrid mapping
panel. Bonnert et al. (1997) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to
map the human MYD88 gene to 3p22-3p21.3.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Lin et al. (2010) reported the crystal structure of the MyD88-IRAK4
(606883)-IRAK2 (603304) death domain complex, which revealed a
left-handed helical oligomer that consists of 6 MyD88, 4 IRAK4, and 4
IRAK2 death domains. Assembly of this helical signaling tower is
hierarchical, in which MyD88 recruits IRAK4 and the MyD88-IRAK4 complex
recruits the IRAK4 substrates IRAK2 or the related IRAK1. Formation of
these myddosome complexes brings the kinase domains of IRAKs into
proximity for phosphorylation and activation. Composite binding sites
are required for recruitment of the individual death domains in the
complex, which are confirmed by mutagenesis and previously identified
signaling mutations. Specificities of myddosome formation are dictated
by both molecular complementation and correspondence of surface
electrostatics.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Von Bernuth et al. (2008) identified 3 different mutations in the MYD88
gene in children with MYD88 deficiency (612260) that resulted in
susceptibility to pyogenic bacterial infections. Four children from 3
kindreds were homozygous for in-frame deletion of glu52 (E52del;
602170.0001). Two sibs were homozygous for an arg196-to-cys (R196C;
602170.0002) mutation, and 1 child from another kindred was compound
heterozygous for the R196C mutation and a leu93-to-pro (L93P;
602170.0003) mutation. Two sibs who died in infancy were presumably
homozygous for the same E52del mutation found in their surviving
brother. The mutations were not found in healthy controls, and all
affected conserved residues. Fibroblast from patients representing the 3
combinations of mutant MYD88 alleles showed normal MYD88 mRNA levels.
Western blot analysis revealed low MYD88 protein levels with the
homozygous E52del mutation and the compound heterozygous L93P/R196C
mutation and normal MYD88 protein levels with the R196C homozygous
mutation. Functional analysis using patient fibroblasts and expression
of wildtype or mutant alleles in cell lines confirmed that all 3 MYD88
mutations resulted in loss of function and led to complete MYD88
deficiency. Von Bernuth et al. (2008) concluded that, like IRAK4
deficiency (607676), MYD88 deficiency abolishes most cytokine responses
to TLR stimulation. Von Bernuth et al. (2008) noted that the immunologic
phenotype of the 9 children they reported with MYD88 deficiency was
similar to that of Myd88-deficient mice, but the infectious phenotype
was different. The MYD88-deficient patients were susceptible to
Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus
pneumoniae, but were normally resistant to most other infectious agents.
In contrast, Myd88-deficient mice had been shown to be susceptible to
almost all pathogens tested.

For a discussion of somatic MYD88 mutation in IgM monoclonal gammopathy
of undetermined significance (MGUS) and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia,
see 602170.0004.

ANIMAL MODEL

Adachi et al. (1998) observed that mice with a targeted disruption of
the Myd88 gene were unable to respond to IL1 (e.g., 147760), as
determined by defective T-cell proliferation and the production of
cytokines. Likewise, Myd88-deficient mice were unable to produce
gamma-interferon (IFNG; 147570) and mediate natural killer cell activity
in response to IL18 (600953). NFKB activation in response to IL1 or IL18
was also impaired. These results indicated that MYD88 is a critical
component in the IL1R and IL18R (604494) signaling cascades. Kawai et
al. (1999) extended these studies to show that responses to
lipopolysaccharide, mediated by TLR4 and CD14 (158120), were lost or
delayed in Myd88-deficient mice, establishing that MYD88 is part of the
TLR signaling cascade as well, acting just upstream of IRAK.

Takeuchi et al. (2000) showed that Tlr2 (603028)- and, particularly,
Myd88-deficient mice are highly susceptible, in terms of growth in blood
and kidney and decreased survival, to infection with Staphylococcus
aureus compared to wildtype mice. In vitro, Tlr2-deficient macrophages
produced reduced TNF and interleukin-6 (IL6; 147620) in response to S.
aureus compared to wildtype or Tlr4-deficient macrophages, whereas
Myd88-deficient macrophages produced no detectable TNF or IL6. The
authors concluded that TLR2 and MYD88 are critical in the defense
against gram-positive bacteria.

Skerrett et al. (2004) found that Myd88-deficient mice were highly
susceptible to aerosol infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but not to
aerosol infection with S. aureus. They concluded that Myd88-dependent
signaling is essential for innate immunity to P. aeruginosa and is
dispensable for resistance to pulmonary S. aureus infection.

Using nonlethal microbial stimuli on Il12b (161561)-deficient mice,
Jankovic et al. (2002) showed that although Th1-type cytokine production
was diminished in the absence of Il12b, the pathogen-specific Cd4
(186940)-positive T cells that emerged nevertheless displayed an
Ifng-dominated lymphokine profile and failed to default to a Th2
phenotype. In mice lacking both Il12b and Il10 (124092), these Th1 cells
were protective. In contrast, in mice lacking Myd88, not only was a
normal Th2-type response to Schistosoma mansoni antigens developed, but,
in response to Toxoplasma gondii antigens, no Ifng was detected and the
mice defaulted to a Th2-type response. Jankovic et al. (2002) proposed
that microbial-induced Th1 polarization is determined during the initial
encounter of pathogens with pattern recognition receptors (e.g., TLRs)
on antigen-presenting cells. They concluded that IL12, however, does not
determine Th1 versus Th2 phenotype.

LaRosa et al. (2008) generated bone marrow chimeras in which T cells,
but not cells involved in innate immune responses, lacked Myd88. These
chimeric mice showed increased susceptibility to T. gondii disease,
developing fatal encephalitis within 30 days. They displayed reduced
Ifng production, and the increased susceptibility was independent of
Il1r and Il18r signaling. LaRosa et al. (2008) proposed that, in
addition to innate immunity, MYD88 expression is necessary in T cells
for prolonged resistance to pathogens.

Bjorkbacka et al. (2004) examined atherosclerotic lesion development in
uninfected Apoe (APOE; 107741) single-null mice and Apoe -/- Myd88 -/-
double-null mice, and found that the Myd88-deficient mice showed a
marked reduction in early atherosclerosis. Inactivation of the Myd88
pathway led to a reduction in atherosclerosis through a decrease in
macrophage recruitment to the artery wall that was associated with
reduced chemokine levels. The findings linked elevated serum lipid
levels to a proinflammatory signaling cascade that is also engaged by
microbial pathogens.

To examine whether Toll-like receptor signaling regulates phagocytosis,
Blander and Medzhitov (2004) compared macrophages from wildtype, Myd88
null, and Tlr2-Tlr4 (603030) double-null mice. Myd null and Tlr2-Tlr4
double-null macrophages were unresponsive to inactivated E. coli.
Blander and Medzhitov (2004) found that activation of the Toll-like
receptor signaling pathway by bacteria, but not apoptotic cells,
regulated phagocytosis at multiple steps including internalization and
phagosome maturation. Phagocytosis of bacteria was impaired in the
absence of Toll-like receptor signaling. Two modes of phagosome
maturation were observed, constitutive and inducible; their differential
engagement depended on the ability of the cargo to trigger Toll-like
receptor signaling.

Fremond et al. (2004) noted that previous investigations had suggested a
minor and redundant role for TLR2, TLR4, and TLR6 (605403) in the early
host response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, but a more
important role in control of chronic infection. Using Myd88 -/- mice,
Fremond et al. (2004) investigated the role of MYD88, which most TLRs,
except TLR3 (603029), use as an intracellular adaptor, in resistance to
Mtb. Macrophages from Myd88 -/- mice had normal upregulation of
costimulatory molecules but reduced cytokine production in response to
Mtb infection. Myd88 -/- mice succumbed to a low-dose aerosol Mtb
infection in approximately 4 weeks, whereas Tnf -/- mice died within 3
weeks, and wildtype mice survived. Death was accompanied by
significantly reduced body weight, increased lung weight, and 2 logs
higher bacillary burden. Like Tnf -/- mice, Myd88 -/- mice developed
massive necrosis and infiltration of inflammatory cells, primarily
neutrophils and macrophages, in lungs. Although BCG vaccination failed
to elicit a delayed-type hypersensitivity response in Myd88 -/- mice, it
did induce antigen-specific Ifng production in splenocytes and also
protected the mice from acute Mtb infection. The Myd88 -/- mice could
not, however, durably control the infection. Fremond et al. (2004)
concluded that the MYD88-mediated signaling pathway is critically
involved in the development of innate, but not adaptive, immunity in
response to Mtb infection.

Using mice lacking Myd88 or various members of the IL1R/TLR superfamily,
Bellocchio et al. (2004) found that the Myd88-dependent pathway was
required for resistance to Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus.
Myd88 signaling could occur through distinct TLRs depending on the
fungal pathogen and the route of infection, and individual TLRs
activated specialized antifungal effector functions on neutrophils.
Myd88-dependent signaling in dendritic cells was crucial for priming the
antifungal Th1 response. Bellocchio et al. (2004) concluded that innate
and adaptive immunity to C. albicans and A. fumigatus requires the
coordinated action of distinct members of the IL1R/TLR superfamily
acting through MYD88.

To evaluate the role of TLRs in B-cell activation and antibody
production, Pasare and Medzhitov (2005) transferred purified B cells
from wildtype, Myd88-deficient, Tlr4-deficient, and Cd40
(109535)-deficient mice into B cell-deficient mu-MT mice, which have a
mutation in the Ighm gene (147020). They found that primary B-cell
activation, including induction of IgM, IgG1, and IgG2 responses, but
not IgE or, probably, IgA responses, required TLRs in addition to helper
T cells. In contrast, Cd40 was required for isotype switching.

Hyaluronan, an extracellular matrix glycosaminoglycan with a repeating
disaccharide structure, is produced after tissue injury, and impaired
clearance results in unremitting inflammation. Jiang et al. (2005) noted
that CD44 (107269) is essential for regulating turnover of hyaluronan,
but it is not required for expression of chemokines by macrophages after
lung injury. Using Tlr-deficient mouse macrophages, they found that
hyaluronan fragments stimulated Mip2 (CXCL2; 139110), Mip1a (CCL3;
182283), and Kc (CXCL1; 155730) in a Tlr2- and Tlr4-dependent manner
that also required Myd88. Mice deficient in Tlr2, Tlr4, or Myd88 showed
impaired transepithelial migration of inflammatory cells, but decreased
survival and enhanced epithelial cell apoptosis after lung injury. Lung
epithelial cell overexpression of high molecular mass hyaluronan
protected against acute lung injury and apoptosis, in part, through
TLR-dependent basal activation of NFKB. Jiang et al. (2005) concluded
that interaction of TLR2 and TLR4 with hyaluronan provides signals that
initiate inflammatory responses, maintain epithelial cell integrity, and
promote recovery from acute lung injury.

Mice genetically deficient in both Myd88 and Trif (607601) have a
complete lack of known Toll-like receptor signaling, thus allowing
assessment of Toll-like receptor dependence of antibody responses. Gavin
et al. (2006) used these double knockouts to investigate the role of
Toll-like receptor signaling in antibody responses to immunization and
the augmenting roles of 4 typical adjuvants (alum, Freund complete
adjuvant, Freund incomplete adjuvant, and monophosphoryl-lipid
A/trehalose dicorynomycolate adjuvant) to that response. Regardless of
adjuvant, these mice exhibited robust antibody responses. Gavin et al.
(2006) concluded that Toll-like receptor signaling does not account for
the action of classical adjuvants and does not fully explain the action
of strong adjuvant containing a Toll-like receptor ligand.

Brown et al. (2007) found that Myd88 -/- mice and Ptgs2 -/- mice
exhibited a profound inhibition of endothelial proliferation and
cellular organization within rectal crypts after injury. The effects of
injury in both mutant mouse strains could be rescued by exogenous
prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), suggesting that Myd88 signaling is upstream of
Ptgs2 and PGE2. In wildtype mice, the combination of injury and Myd88
signaling led to repositioning of a subset of Ptgs2-expressing stromal
cells from the mesenchyme surrounding the middle and upper crypts to an
area surrounding the crypt base adjacent to colonic epithelial
progenitor cells. Brown et al. (2007) concluded that the MYD88 and
prostaglandin signaling pathways interact to preserve epithelial
proliferation during injury, and that proper cellular mobilization
within the crypt niche is critical to repair after injury.

Apc (611731) Min/+ mice spontaneously develop intestinal tumors and, on
average, die within 6 months of age. Rakoff-Nahoum and Medzhitov (2007)
showed that deletion of Myd88 in Min/+ mice reduced morbidity and
mortality, as well as the size and numbers of intestinal polyps,
compared with sex- and age-matched controls. They concluded that
MYD88-dependent signaling controls the expression of several key
modifier genes of intestinal tumorigenesis and that MYD88 has a critical
role in both spontaneous and carcinogen-induced tumor development.

Wen et al. (2008) showed that specific pathogen-free NOD mice lacking
Myd88, an adaptor for multiple innate immune receptors that recognize
microbial stimuli, do not develop type 1 diabetes (222100). The effect
is dependent on commensal microbes because germ-free Myd88-negative NOD
mice develop robust diabetes, whereas colonization of these germ-free
Myd88-negative NOD mice with a defined microbial consortium
(representing bacterial phyla normally present in human gut) attenuates
type 1 diabetes. Wen et al. (2008) also found that Myd88 deficiency
changes the composition of the distal gut microbiota, and that exposure
to the microbiota of specific pathogen-free Myd88-negative NOD donors
attenuates type 1 diabetes in germ-free NOD recipients. Wen et al.
(2008) concluded that, taken together, their findings indicated that
interaction of the intestinal microbes with the innate immune system is
a critical epigenetic factor modifying type 1 diabetes predisposition.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MYD88 DEFICIENCY
MYD88, 3-BP DEL, 160GAG

Von Bernuth et al. (2008) identified a homozygous in-frame 3-bp (GAG)
deletion in exon 1 of the MYD88 gene, resulting in deletion of glu52
(E52del), in 4 children with functional MYD88 deficiency (612260). A
French patient with the E52del mutation died in infancy. Two sibs of a
Spanish Gypsy patient with the mutation also died in infancy and were
presumed to have the mutation. The surviving patients were 3.5 to 7
years old. All patients shared a history of susceptibility to pyogenic
bacterial infections caused by S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, or S.
pneumoniae. Functional analysis confirmed that the E52del mutation
resulted in loss of function.

.0002
MYD88 DEFICIENCY
MYD88, ARG196CYS

Von Bernuth et al. (2008) identified a homozygous 586C-T transition in
exon 3 of the MYD88 gene, resulting in an arg196-to-cys (R196C)
substitution, in 2 sibs from Portugal with functional MYD88 deficiency
(612260). These patients were 9 and 16 years old. Von Bernuth et al.
(2008) also identified an unrelated, 3-year-old patient from Turkey who
was compound heterozygous for the R196C mutation and a 278T-C transition
in exon 1 that resulted in a leu93-to-pro (L93P; 602170.0003)
substitution. All 3 patients shared a history of susceptibility to
pyogenic bacterial infections caused by S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, or S.
pneumoniae. Functional analysis confirmed that both mutations resulted
in loss of function.

MYD88, LEU265PRO (dbSNP rs38182641)

Ngo et al. (2011) described the dependence of activated B cell-like
(ABC) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCLs) on MYD88 and the discovery
of highly recurrent oncogenic mutations affecting MYD88 in ABC DLBCL
tumors. RNA interference screening revealed that MYD88 and the
associated kinases IRAK1 (300283) and IRAK4 (606883) are essential for
ABC DLBCL survival. High-throughput RNA resequencing uncovered MYD88
mutations in ABC DLBCL lines. Notably, 29% of ABC DLBCL tumors harbored
the same amino acid substitution, L265P, in the MYD88 Toll/IL1 receptor
(TIR) domain at an evolutionarily invariant residue in its hydrophobic
core. This mutation was rare or absent in other DLBCL subtypes and
Burkitt lymphoma (113970), but was observed in 9% of mucosa-associated
lymphoid tissue lymphomas. At a lower frequency, additional mutations
were observed in the MYD88 TIR domain, occurring in both the ABC and
germinal center B cell-like (GCB) DLBCL subtypes. Survival of ABC DLBCL
cells bearing the L265P mutation was sustained by the mutant but not the
wildtype MYD88 isoform, demonstrating that L265P is a gain-of-function
driver mutation. The L265P mutant promoted cell survival by
spontaneously assembling a protein complex containing IRAK1 and IRAK4,
leading to IRAK4 kinase activity, IRAK1 phosphorylation, NF-kappa-B (see
164011) signaling, JAK kinase (see 147795) activation of STAT3 (102582),
and secretion of IL6 (147620), IL10 (124092), and interferon-beta
(147640). Hence, Ngo et al. (2011) concluded that the MYD88 signaling
pathway is integral to the pathogenesis of ABC DLBCL, supporting the
development of inhibitors of IRAK4 kinase and other components of this
pathway for the treatment of tumors bearing oncogenic MYD88 mutations.

Treon et al. (2012) performed whole-genome sequencing of bone marrow
lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) cells in 30 patients with Waldenstrom
macroglobulinemia (153600), with paired normal-tissue and tumor-tissue
sequencing in 10 patients. Sanger sequencing was used to validate the
findings from an expanded cohort of patients with LPL, those with other
B-cell disorders that have some of the same features as LPL, and healthy
donors. Among the patients with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, Treon et
al. (2012) identified a somatic mutation, L265P (dbSNP rs38182641), in
samples from all 10 patients with paired tissue samples and in 17 of 20
samples from patients with unpaired samples. This T-to-C transition
predicted an amino acid change that triggers IRAK-mediated NF-kappa-B
signaling. Sanger sequencing identified MYD88 L265P in tumor samples
from 49 of 54 patients with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia and in 3 of 3
patients with non-IgM-secreting lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) (91% of
all patients with LPL). MYD88 L265P was absent in paired normal-tissue
samples from patients with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia or non-IgM LPL
and in B cells from healthy donors and was absent or rarely expressed in
samples from patients with multiple myeloma, marginal-zone lymphoma, or
IgM monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance. Inhibition of MYD88
signaling reduced I-kappa-B-alpha (164008) and NF-kappa-B p65 (164014)
phosphorylation, as well as NF-kappa-B nuclear staining, in Waldenstrom
macroglobulinemia cells expressing MYD88 L265P. Similar results were
obtained when cells expressing MYD88 L265P were incubated with an
IRAK1/4 kinase inhibitor. Somatic variants in ARID1A (603024) in 5 of 30
patients (17%), leading to a premature stop or frameshift, were also
identified and were associated with an increased disease burden. In
addition, 2 of 3 patients with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia who had
wildtype MYD88 had somatic variants in MLL2 (602113). Treon et al.
(2012) concluded that MYD88 L265P is a commonly recurring mutation in
patients with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia that can be useful in
differentiating Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia and non-IgM LPL from
B-cell disorders that have phenotypic overlap.

Landgren and Staudt (2012) used Sanger sequencing to assess the status
of MYD88 L265P expression in patients with IgM monoclonal gammopathy of
undetermined significance (MGUS) and found expression of this variant in
5 of 9 patients. All of these patients had both clonal plasma cells and
clonal lymphocytes in bone marrow (lymphoplasmacytic precursor
neoplasm), suggesting to Landgren and Staudt (2012) that this mutation
is a precursor to Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia rather than
transformation from IgM MGUS to Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. Treon et
al. (2012) commented that, to overcome the limitations of Sanger
sequencing, they developed an allele-specific polymerase chain reaction
(AS-PCR) assay to detect the MYD88 L265P mutation with a threshold
detection limit of 0.1% (approximately 100-fold better than that of
Sanger sequencing). They found that 88 of 96 patients with Waldenstrom
macroglobulinemia (92%) and 5 of 11 patients with IgM MGUS (45%), as
defined by consensus criteria, were positive for MYD88 L265P expression
by either conventional or quantitative AS-PCR assays. Treon et al.
(2012) concluded that IgM MGUS is heterogeneous and that MYD88 L265P is
probably a driver mutation toward Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia.

602862	TITLE *602862 UDP-N-ACETYLGLUCOSAMINE PYROPHOSPHORYLASE 1; UAP1
;;SPERM-ASSOCIATED ANTIGEN 2; SPAG2;;
ANTIGEN X; AgX
DESCRIPTION The correlation of humoral antisperm antibodies with some cases of
unexplained infertility in male and female patients suggests a role for
these antibodies in blocking fertilization. Diekman and Goldberg (1994)
reported that antigen X (AgX) was originally identified by screening a
human testis cDNA expression library with a pool of sera from male and
female patients presenting at an infertility clinic. Several clinical
tests determined that the individual sera contained antisperm
antibodies. Diekman and Goldberg (1994) isolated cDNAs encoding 2
isoforms of AgX, designated AgX1 and AgX2, from human testis and
placenta cDNA libraries, respectively. Compared with the coding sequence
of AgX1, the AgX2 coding sequence contains a 48-bp insertion which
encodes 16 amino acids in the C-terminal region. The authors suggested
that the AgX1 and AgX2 cDNAs represent alternatively spliced AgX
transcripts. Northern blot analysis detected an abundant, approximately
2.3-kb AgX transcript in testis and a slightly higher molecular mass
transcript in placenta. Quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated that both AgX
mRNAs were expressed in all tissues examined but at varying relative
amounts. The predicted 505-amino acid AgX1 and 521-amino acid AgX2
proteins are globular and cytosolic, and contain motifs indicative of
nucleotide binding. Western blot analysis using antibodies against AgX
detected approximately 56- and 58-kD proteins in human testis and sperm
extracts; only the 58-kD protein was found in placenta, skeletal muscle,
and seminal plasma. These masses correlated well with the calculated
masses of 55.5 kD and 57.3 kD for AgX1 and AgX2, respectively.
Immunofluorescence analysis of human sperm localized AgX to the
principal piece of the tail, the neck region of the head, and, to a
lesser extent, the midpiece of the tail.

Mio et al. (1998) cloned a human UDP-N-acetylglucosamine
pyrophosphorylase-1 (UAP1) cDNA and found that it was identical to the
AgX1 cDNA isolated by Diekman and Goldberg (1994). UAP1 catalyzes the
final step of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) biosynthesis from
fructose-6-phosphate. In eukaryotes, UDP-GlcNAc is used in the GlcNAc
moiety of N-linked glycosylation and the glycosylphosphatidylinositol
(GPI)-anchor of cellular proteins.

608428	TITLE *608428 CYTOCHROME P450, SUBFAMILY XXVIC, POLYPEPTIDE 1; CYP26C1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Retinoids are potent regulators of cell proliferation, cell
differentiation, and morphogenesis. CYP26 family members, such as
CYP26C1, catabolize all-trans retinoic acid (RA) and contribute to the
control of RA levels in tissues and cells.

CLONING

By searching for genomic sequences similar to CYP26 family members,
followed by RT-PCR of adrenal mRNA, Taimi et al. (2004) cloned CYP26C1.
The deduced 522-amino acid protein contains a heme thiolate benchmark
motif characteristic of all cytochrome p450s. CYP26C1 shares 43% amino
acid identity with CYP26A1 (602239) and 51% amino acid identity with
CYP26B1 (605207). PCR analysis detected CYP26C1 expression in most
tissues at low levels.

GENE STRUCTURE

Taimi et al. (2004) determined that the CYP26C1 gene contains 6 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Taimi et al. (2004) mapped the CYP26C1
gene to chromosome 10, within 13 kb of the CYP26A1 gene.

GENE FUNCTION

Taimi et al. (2004) found that expression of CYP26C1 in a keratinocyte
cell line increased approximately 15- and 50-fold following induction
with all-trans RA and 9-cis RA, respectively. Transiently transfected
cells expressing CYP26C1 converted all-trans RA to polar water-soluble
metabolites similar to those generated by CYP26A1 and CYP26B1; however,
CYP26C1 also recognized and metabolized 9-cis RA. CYP26C1 was much less
sensitive than the other CYP26 enzymes to inhibition with ketoconazole.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a sister and brother with focal facial dermal dysplasia (FFDD4;
614974) who were negative for mutation in the TWIST2 gene (607556),
Slavotinek et al. (2013) identified compound heterozygosity for a
duplication and a missense mutation in the CYP26C1 gene (608428.0001 and
608428.0002, respectively). Sanger sequencing in 12 more FFDD patients
revealed 3 patients with FFDD4 who were homozygous for the CYP26C1
duplication. Both mutations were shown to cause CYP26C1 loss of function
by in vitro expression studies.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
FOCAL FACIAL DERMAL DYSPLASIA 4
CYP26C1, 7-BP DUP, NT844

In a sister and brother with focal facial dermal dysplasia-4 (FFDD4;
614974), Slavotinek et al. (2013) identified compound heterozygosity for
a 7-bp tandem duplication (844_851dupCCATGCA) in exon 4 of the CYP26C1
gene, causing a frameshift predicted to result in the incorporation of
128 different amino acids from wildtype residue 284 and then premature
termination before residue 412, and a 1433A-G transition in exon 6 that
results in an arg478-to-his (R478H; 608428.0002) substitution within the
L-helix domain. Their unaffected parents were each heterozygous for 1 of
the mutations, neither of which was found in 2 unaffected sibs.
Sequencing revealed homozygosity for the 7-bp duplication in 3
additional FFDD4 patients: a previously unreported Belgian girl, as well
as a Flemish girl and a Norwegian boy who were originally described by
Prescott et al. (2006). The R478H mutation was not found in the Exome
Variant Server containing data from more than 10,000 individuals.
However, the duplication, which was not present in the dbSNP or 1000
Genomes databases or in 200 control chromosomes of Hispanic ethnicity,
was detected in 1 (0.4%) of 318 Caucasian chromosomes and in 1 (0.3%) of
236 chromosomes from individuals with eye or diaphragmatic birth
defects, for an overall frequency of 2 (0.3%) in 754 chromosomes,
suggesting that the FFDD4 phenotype might be nonpenetrant or
underascertained. Transfection studies in COS-1 cells demonstrated that
both mutations caused loss of CYP26C1 function.

613368	TITLE *613368 CARNOSINE SYNTHASE 1; CARNS1
;;ATP-GRASP DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; ATPGD1;;
KIAA1394
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CARNS1 (EC 6.3.2.11), a member of the ATP-grasp family of ATPases,
catalyzes the formation of carnosine (beta-alanyl-L-histidine) and
homocarnosine (gamma-aminobutyryl-L-histidine), which are found mainly
in skeletal muscle and the central nervous system, respectively (Drozak
et al., 2010).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned CARNS1, which they designated
KIAA1394. RT-PCR ELISA detected very high CARNS1 expression in whole
adult and fetal brain and in all specific adult brain regions examined.
High expression was also detected in heart and skeletal muscle, with
much lower expression in other tissues examined.

By searching databases for orthologs of chicken Atpgd1, followed by PCR
of mouse muscle/brain and human brain cDNA libraries, Drozak et al.
(2010) cloned mouse and human CARNS1, which they called ATPGD1. The
deduced proteins contain 957 and 950 amino acids, respectively, and both
contain 2 ATP-grasp domains, with highest conservation in the C-terminal
catalytic domain. Gel filtration analysis showed that mouse Atpgd1, like
the chicken enzyme, was expressed as a homotetramer of about 430 kD in
transfected HEK293 cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Drozak et al. (2010) showed that, in the presence of L-histidine and
ATP, purified chicken Atpgd1 converted beta-alanine to carnosine plus
ADP and inorganic phosphate. Mouse and human ATPGD1 catalyzed the same
reaction following expression in HEK293 cells. All 3 enzymes were not
specific with respect to the amino acid serving as the acceptor,
although L-histidine was preferred, and all 3 were also more efficient
in synthesizing carnosine than homocarnosine and other dipeptides.
Drozak et al. (2010) suggested that the lower catalytic efficiency of
homocarnosine synthesis is compensated for by the high concentration of
gamma-aminobutyric acid substrate in brain.

GENE STRUCTURE

Drozak et al. (2010) determined that CARNS1 contains 9 coding exons.
Exon 1 encodes the initiator ATG only.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Drozak et al. (2010) mapped the CARNS1
gene to chromosome 11q13. They mapped the mouse Carns1 gene to
chromosome 19.

602572	TITLE *602572 ANNEXIN A11; ANXA11
;;ANNEXIN XI; ANX11;;
AUTOANTIGEN, 56-KD
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ANXA11 is a member of the annexin family of calcium-dependent
phospholipid-binding proteins. Annexins have unique N-terminal domains
and homologous C-terminal domains containing the calcium-dependent
phospholipid-binding sites.

CLONING

To identify a 56-kD antigen recognized by sera from patients with
autoimmune diseases, Misaki et al. (1994) screened a human
teratocarcinoma cDNA expression library with the anti-56-kD antigen
autoantibodies. They isolated a cDNA predicting a 505-amino acid protein
with 60% identity to other annexins in the conserved C-terminal domain
and 92.5% identity to bovine annexin XI over the entire protein. Misaki
et al. (1994) concluded that the 56-kD autoantigen is human annexin XI,
or ANXA11.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bances et al. (2000) determined that the mouse Anxa11 gene contains 15
exons and spans 40 kB. Exon 1 is untranslated, and intron 1 spans about
20 kb. The human ANXA11 gene has the same general structure as the mouse
gene; however, EST database analysis indicated that human ANXA11
transcripts also use variably spliced exons 1b and 1c, which can
lengthen the 5-prime UTR. The intronic sequences of the mouse and human
ANXA11 genes contain several types of repetitive elements, including
retroviral long terminal repeats. The mouse promoter region contains a
remnant LINE-1 insertion not found in the human gene. The 5-prime
flanking region of the ANXA11 gene contains a CpG island and MYOD
(159970), SP1 (189906), and glucocorticoid response elements, but no
proximal TATA or CAAT boxes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

For discussion of a possible association between variation in the ANXA11
gene and susceptibility to sarcoidosis, see SS3 (612388).

MAPPING

Morgan et al. (1998) mapped the ANXA11 gene to 10q22.3-q23.1 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

By genomic sequence analysis, Bances et al. (2000) mapped the mouse
Anxa11 gene to chromosome 14.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By positional cloning of a candidate region for autosomal recessive
deafness-63 (DFNB63; 611451) on chromosome 11q13, Ahmed et al. (2008)
identified the LRRC51 gene, which they termed LRTOMT. Analysis of
corresponding clones isolated from a human liver cDNA library showed 5
alternatively spliced transcripts of LRTOMT that were widely expressed.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ahmed et al. (2008) determined that the LRTOMT gene contains 10 exons.
Exons 5, 7, and 8 have dual reading frames. LRTOMT has 2 alternative
reading frames and encodes 2 different proteins, LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2,
that differ by translation start codons. When translation starts in exon
3, the encoded protein has a predicted transmembrane domain, 2
leucine-rich repeats, and is named LRTOMT1. Translation beginning in
exon 5 produces LRTOMT2, which is predicted to have a
catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT; 116790) domain. Depending on the use
of an alternative acceptor splice site in exon 8, LRTOMT2 may have a
predicted transmembrane helix.

EVOLUTION

Ahmed et al. (2008) noted that unlike humans, mice have 2 genes, Lrrc51
and Tomt, that correspond to human LRTOMT. These genes are not fused.
Mouse Lrrc51 has 6 exons and is predicted to encode a 253-residue
protein with 2 leucine-rich repeats. Mouse Tomt contains 4 exons and is
predicted to encode a 258-residue protein with 1 transmembrane helix and
a COMT domain. Mouse Lrrc51 and human LRTOMT1 share 85% amino acid
identity, whereas mouse Tomt and isoform D-prime (residues 34 to 291) of
human LRTOMT2 share 91% amino acid identity. In protein from human liver
and kidney, antisera against mouse Tomt recognized a 38-kD LRTOMT2
protein. The findings indicated that mouse Lrrc51 and Tomt are separate
genes encoding 2 different proteins, and that human LRTOMT is a larger
fusion gene with transcripts that are translated in 2 different reading
frames giving rise to LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2, which have no sequence
similarity to one another. Tomt expression was observed in mouse embryo
sensory cells of the cochlea, utricle, and saccule. Lrrc51 was detected
in inner and outer hair cells of the inner ear.

MAPPING

The LRTOMT gene maps to chromosome 11q13.3-q13.4 (Ahmed et al., 2008).
The mouse Lrrc51 and Tomt genes, which together are orthologous to human
LRTOMT, are located on chromosome 7qE3, which shows conserved synteny
with human 11q13.3-q13.4.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 4 unrelated families with autosomal recessive
deafness 63, Ahmed et al. (2008) identified 4 different homozygous
mutations in the LRTOMT gene (612414.0001-612414.0004). The families
were of Turkish, Tunisian, and Pakistani origin.

Du et al. (2008) directly sequenced the 5 exons of the LRTOMT gene in
192 unrelated congenitally deaf progeny of consanguineous Iranian
parentage and identified homozygosity for a nonsense mutation in 1
family (612414.0005). A homozygous missense mutation was identified in
another family, but the effect of the mutation on protein and
methyltransferase activity was unclear.

ANIMAL MODEL

In 'add' homozygous mice, which exhibit hyperkinetic behavior that
includes circling, head tossing, and repetitive, short-lasting arching
of the neck, Du et al. (2008) performed mapping studies that localized
the region of interest to a 1.1-Mb interval on distal chromosome 7 and
identified a missense mutation at a highly conserved residue in the
4-exon Tomt gene. Formal behavioral and electrophysiologic tests
revealed that 'add' mice have profound sensorineural deafness and
vestibular impairment. In situ hybridization studies showed strong
expression of Tomt in the outer and inner hair cells of the cochlea and
vestibule, with no expression in any other tissue, including the CNS.
Electron microscopy demonstrated progressive deterioration of the organ
of Corti in 'add' homozygous mice.

600921	TITLE *600921 FIBROBLAST GROWTH FACTOR 9; FGF9
;;GLIA-ACTIVATING FACTOR; GAF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) gene family, such as FGF9,
are peptide regulatory factors that act through distinct tyrosine kinase
receptors and are involved in various biologic processes during
embryogenesis and adult life, including implantation, morphogenesis,
angiogenesis, and possibly tumorigenesis (Miyamoto et al., 1993; Mattei
et al., 1995).

CLONING

Miyamoto et al. (1993) purified a 30-kD heparin-binding polypeptide in
the culture supernatant of a human glioma cell line. By PCR of the
isolated N-terminal sequence, followed by screening a human foreskin
cDNA library, Miyamoto et al. (1993) cloned FGF9. The deduced 208-amino
acid protein shares 94% sequence homology with rat Fgf9. Northern blot
analysis in human glioma cells detected a major 4.3-kb band and minor
3.4- and 2.7-kb bands. Northern blot analysis of rat tissues detected
strong expression in kidney and low expression in brain.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wu et al. (2009) stated that the FGF9 gene contains 3 exons.

MAPPING

By radioactive chromosomal in situ hybridization, Mattei et al. (1995)
mapped the FGF9 gene to chromosome 13q11-q12.

By genomic sequence analysis, Katoh and Katoh (2005) mapped the FGF9
gene to chromosome 13q12.11 in a head-to-head orientation with the EFHA1
gene (610632). They determined that the FGF9-EFHA1 locus and the FGF20
(605558)-EFHA2 (610633) locus on chromosome 8p22 are paralogous regions
within the human genome.

GENE FUNCTION

Using the Cre/loxP system, Sun et al. (2000) found that maintenance of
Fgf9 and Fgf17 (603725) expression is dependent on Shh (600725), whereas
Fgf8 (600483) expression is not. Sun et al. (2000) developed a model in
which no individual Fgf expressed in the apical ectodermal ridge is
solely necessary to maintain Shh expression, but instead the combined
activity of 2 or more apical ectodermal ridge Fgfs function in a
positive feedback loop with Shh to control limb development.

Mariani et al. (2008) demonstrated that mouse limbs lacking Fgf4
(164980), Fgf9, and Fgf17 have normal skeletal pattern, indicating that
Fgf8 is sufficient among apical ectodermal ridge fibroblast growth
factors (AER-FGFs) to sustain normal limb formation. Inactivation of
Fgf8 alone causes a mild skeletal phenotype; however, when Mariani et
al. (2008) also removed different combinations of the other AER-FGF
genes, they obtained unexpected skeletal phenotypes of increasing
severity, reflecting the contribution that each FGF can make to the
total AER-FGF signal. Analysis of the compound mutant limb buds revealed
that, in addition to sustaining cell survival, AER-FGFs regulate
proximal-distal patterning gene expression during early limb bud
development, providing genetic evidence that AER-FGFs function to
specify a distal domain and challenging the longstanding hypothesis that
AER-FGF signaling is permissive rather than instructive for limb
patterning. Mariani et al. (2008) also developed a 2-signal model for
proximal-distal patterning to explain early specification.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a 5-generation Chinese family with autosomal dominant multiple
synostoses syndrome mapping to chromosome 13q11-q12 (SYNS3; 612961), Wu
et al. (2009) identified a heterozygous missense mutation in the FGF9
gene (600921.0001) that segregated with disease and was not found in 250
unrelated ethnically matched controls.

ANIMAL MODEL

Colvin et al. (2001) reported male-to-female sex reversal in mice
lacking Fgf9, demonstrating a novel role for FGF signaling in testicular
embryogenesis. Fgf9 -/- mice also exhibited lung hypoplasia and died at
birth. Reproductive system phenotypes ranged from testicular hypoplasia
to complete sex reversal, with most Fgf9 -/- XY reproductive systems
appearing grossly female at birth. Fgf9 appeared to act downstream of
Sry (480000) to stimulate mesenchymal proliferation, mesonephric cell
migration, and Sertoli cell differentiation in the embryonic testis.
While Sry is found only in some mammals, Fgfs are highly conserved.
Thus, Fgfs may function in sex determination and reproductive system
development in many species.

The dominant mouse mutant 'elbow knee synostosis' (Eks) is characterized
by radiohumeral and tibiofemoral synostosis, craniosynostosis, and lung
hypoplasia. Harada et al. (2009) identified a mutation in the Fgf9 gene
that resulted in an asn143-to-thr substitution in Eks mice. The
Fgf9(Eks) mutation prevented homodimerization of Fgf9, consequently
decreasing the affinity of Fgf9 for heparin. As a result, Fgf9(Eks) was
more diffusible in developing tissues, leading to ectopic Fgf9 signaling
in prospective joints and sutures, where it repressed development. The
reduction in Fgf9 affinity for heparin appeared to be due to the
predominance of the monomeric form rather than to changes in its
intrinsic affinity for heparin. Harada et al. (2009) concluded that the
affinity of FGF9 for heparin sulfate proteoglycan, and therefore the
range of FGF9 signaling in developing tissue, is controlled, at least in
part, by FGF9 monomer-dimer equilibrium.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MULTIPLE SYNOSTOSES SYNDROME 3
FGF9, SER99ASN

In 12 affected members of a 5-generation Chinese family with autosomal
dominant multiple synostoses syndrome (SYNS3; 612961), Wu et al. (2009)
identified heterozygosity for a 296G-A transition in exon 2 of the FGF9
gene, resulting in a ser99-to-asn (S99N) substitution predicted to alter
binding to FGFR3 (134934). The mutation was not found in unaffected
family members or in 250 unrelated ethnically matched controls. In vitro
studies demonstrated that mutant FGF9 was expressed and secreted as
efficiently as wildtype in transfected cells; however, it induced
compromised chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation, accompanied
by enhanced osteogenic differentiation and matrix mineralization of bone
marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. Biochemical analysis revealed
that the S99N mutation caused significantly impaired FGF signaling, as
evidenced by diminished activity of the ERK1/2 pathway (see 176948) and
decreased beta-catenin (116806) and c-MYC (190080) expression when
compared with wildtype FGF9. Binding of mutant protein to the receptor
FGFR3 was severely impaired, although homodimerization of mutant FGF9 to
itself or wildtype was not detectably affected, providing a basis for
the observed defective FGF9 signaling.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Experimental evidence indicates that specific protein-tyrosine
phosphatases (PTPases) interact with members of cascades to modulate
biologic function differentiation and development. Experiments suggested
that the PTPases PTP-beta (176882) and PTP-epsilon (600926) are involved
in the early molecular events for in vitro differentiation of mouse
erythroleukemia (MEL) as well as embryonic carcinoma (F9) cells
(Watanabe et al., 1995).

CLONING

A human homolog of mouse Ptprj, encoding PTP-beta-2, was identified by
Ostman et al. (1994).

Honda et al. (1994) cloned and characterized the PTPRJ gene, which they
designated HPTP-eta. The predicted protein has a molecular mass of
approximately 220 to 250 kD and contains an extracellular region
homologous to fibronectin type III repeats, a transmembrane region, and
a cytoplasmic region containing a single PTPase-like domain.

MAPPING

Honda et al. (1994) mapped the PTPRJ gene to chromosome 11p11.2 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

Using mouse cDNA for PTP-beta-2 and PTP-epsilon, Watanabe et al. (1995)
assigned the genes, Ptprj and Ptpre, to chromosome 2 and chromosome 7,
respectively.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Nonfamilial, 'sporadic' cancers, which represent most cancer cases, have
a significant hereditary component, but the genes involved have low
penetrance and are extremely difficult to detect. Therefore, mapping and
cloning of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for cancer susceptibility in
animals may help identify homologous genes in humans. For example,
several cancer susceptibility QTLs were mapped in mouse and rat. One of
these, the mouse gene Scc1 (susceptibility to colon cancer-1), was
positionally cloned by Ruivenkamp et al. (2002) and identified as Ptprj,
which encodes a receptor-type protein-tyrosine phosphatase. Furthermore,
in human cancers of colon, lung, and breast, Ruivenkamp et al. (2002)
found frequent deletions, loss of heterozygosity, and missense mutations
in the PTPRJ gene (see, e.g., 600925.0001-600925.0002).

Lesueur et al. (2005) assessed common SNPs and haplotypes of the PTPRJ
gene in 4,512 breast cancer (114480) patients and 4,554 controls from
East Anglia, U.K. The authors observed a difference in the haplotype
frequency distributions between patients and controls (P = 0.0023; OR =
0.81; range 0.72-0.92). They concluded that carrying a specific PTPRJ
haplotype may confer a protective effect on the risk of breast cancer.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
COLON CANCER, SOMATIC
PTPRJ, ARG214CYS

Ruivenkamp et al. (2002) identified 5 somatic missense mutations in the
PTPRJ gene in colon cancer (see 114500). Sequence alignments, secondary
structure prediction, and homology modeling predicted with high
confidence levels that most of these in the extracellular portion of the
gene product occur in exposed regions available for interactions with
ligands or other proteins and could affect the signaling process. One of
these missense mutations was an arg214-to-cys mutation (R214C) that
resulted in loss of a positive charge.

.0002
COLON CANCER, SOMATIC
PTPRJ, GLN276PRO

In a colon cancer (see 114500), Ruivenkamp et al. (2002) found a
gln276-to-pro (Q276P) mutation in exon 5 of the PTPRJ gene. The change
was predicted to result in torsional stress.

612502	TITLE *612502 COLLECTIN 11; COLEC11
;;COLLECTIN, KIDNEY, 1; CLK1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

COLEC11 is a member of the collectin family of C-type lectins, which
contain a collagen-like domain and a carbohydrate recognition domain,
and play a role in host-defense (Keshi et al., 2006).

CLONING

By EST database screening using the carbohydrate recognition domain
(CRD) of human liver collectin, CLL1 (COLEC10; 607620), followed by
5-prime RACE of human kidney cDNA libraries, Keshi et al. (2006) cloned
COLEC11, which they called CLK1. The deduced 271-amino acid COLEC11
protein contains an N-terminal region with a cysteine residue, a
collagen-like sequence, a neck region, a CRD, and a predicted signal
peptide of 25-amino acids; the mature predicted protein consists of 246
amino acids. By RT-PCR analysis, Keshi et al. (2006) isolated putative
splice variants for transcripts lacking exon 2, exon 3, and both exons 2
and 3. RT-PCR analysis detected COLEC11 transcripts in most tissues
examined, with high expression in kidney, liver, fetal liver, small
intestine, thymus, spinal cord, placenta, adrenal gland, pancreas, and
several cell lines. No expression was detected in skeletal muscle, bone
marrow, or in the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293. Keshi et al.
(2006) localized COLEC11 to the Golgi-endoplasmic reticulum (ER).
Western analysis determined that COLEC11 is a secreted protein, and that
all COLEC11 isoforms have oligomeric structures created through
disulfide bonding. Keshi et al. (2006) detected native COLEC11 protein
in human serum.

Rooryck et al. (2011) observed broadly distributed expression of Clk1 in
mouse tissues at embryonic day (E) 13.5, including craniofacial
cartilage, (nasal septum, Meckel cartilage, and posterior palate),
heart, bronchi, kidney, and vertebral bodies. They also observed
expression in palatal structures at E13.5 and E15.5. Examination of
zebrafish embryos revealed colec11 expression in the pronephric duct,
lateral hindbrain, and liver.

GENE FUNCTION

Using recombinant COLEC11, Keshi et al. (2006) showed that COLEC11
displays Ca(2+)-dependent binding to fucose, weaker binding to mannose,
and does not bind N-acetyl-galactosamine, N-acetyl-glucosamine, or
glucose. COLEC11 binds a variety of microbial saccharides including LPS
from E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, as well as S. cerevisiae mannan.

Rooryck et al. (2011) evaluated cellular localization of Clk1 in a
murine chondrocyte cell line and observed specific localization in the
Golgi apparatus, consistent with a secreted peptide. Using antisense
morpholinos against the initiation site and the exon 2/intron 2 splice
site in zebrafish embryos, Rooryck et al. (2011) found that the effect
was dose-dependent, with higher doses producing heart edema, pronephric
cyst formation, curved body axis, disorganized pigment distribution, and
high mortality. Staining of cartilage in zebrafish morphants at 5 days
postfertilization revealed reduced mandibular length, malformation of
the anterior neurocranium with shortening of the trabeculae and ethmoid
plate, and shortening and abnormal angulation of the ceratohyal
cartilage compared to controls. Rooryck et al. (2011) tested for
epistasis between COLEC11 and MASP1 (600521) by injection of suboptimal
doses (below which no phenotype is seen when injected alone) of both
colec11 and masp1 morpholinos into single-cell-stage zebrafish embryos,
and found that approximately 73% developed severe craniofacial
abnormalities and some developed clefts in the ethmoid plate. These
results suggested that the COLEC11 and MASP1 gene products function in
the same pathway.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 4 consanguineous families with 3MC syndrome mapping to chromosome
2p25 (3MC2; 265050), Rooryck et al. (2011) analyzed candidate genes and
identified homozygosity for 1 nonsense and 2 missense mutations and 1
in-frame deletion in the COLEC11 gene (612502.0001-612502.0004,
respectively). Analysis of COLEC11 in additional 3MC patients revealed
homozygous mutations in 3 more probands (see, e.g., 612502.0005 and
612502.0006).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
3MC SYNDROME 2
COLEC11, SER169PRO

In a brother and sister from a consanguineous Tunisian family with 3MC
syndrome-2 (3MC2; 265050), Rooryck et al. (2011) identified homozygosity
for a 496T-C transition in exon 8 of the COLEC11 gene, resulting in a
ser169-to-pro (S169P) substitution at a conserved residue. The mutated
alleles segregated with the disorder in the family and the mutation was
not found in 60 Tunisian or 284 northern European control chromosomes.

.0002
3MC SYNDROME 2
COLEC11, 1-BP DEL, 45C

In a sister and brother from a consanguineous Bangladeshi family with
3MC syndrome-2 (3MC2; 265050), Rooryck et al. (2011) identified
homozygosity for a 1-bp deletion (45delC) in exon 2 of the COLEC11 gene,
causing a frameshift predicted to result in premature termination. The
mutated alleles segregated with the disorder in the family and the
mutation was not found in 94 Bangladeshi or 284 northern European
control chromosomes.

.0003
3MC SYNDROME 2
COLEC11, GLY204SER

In 2 brothers from a consanguineous Afghan family with 3MC syndrome-2
(3MC2; 265050), Rooryck et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for a
610G-A transition in exon 8 of the COLEC11 gene, resulting in a
gly204-to-ser (G204S) substitution at a highly conserved residue in the
carbohydrate recognition domain. The G204S mutation was also detected in
homozygosity in a Pakistani 3MC patient. The mutated alleles segregated
with the disorder in both families and the mutation was not found in 72
Bangladeshi or 284 northern European control chromosomes. Using protein
blotting, Rooryck et al. (2011) did not detect any secreted CLK1 in
serum from the 2 affected Afghan brothers, in contrast to control
samples, suggesting that the G204S substitution leads to cellular
retention of the protein.

.0004
3MC SYNDROME 2
COLEC11, 3-BP DEL, 648CTC

In a Saudi Arabian patient with 3MC syndrome-2 (265050), Rooryck et al.
(2011) identified homozygosity for a 3-bp in-frame deletion (648CTC) in
exon 8 of the COLEC11 gene, resulting in the deletion of a highly
conserved serine residue (ser217del) in the carbohydrate recognition
domain. The mutated alleles segregated with the disorder in the family,
and the mutation was not found in 192 Saudi control chromosomes.

.0005
3MC SYNDROME 2
COLEC11, 1-BP DEL, 300T

In a female patient with 3MC syndrome-2 (265050) from the Italian family
originally reported by Mingarelli et al. (1996), Rooryck et al. (2011)
identified homozygosity for a 1-bp deletion (300delT) in exon 6 of the
COLEC11 gene, causing a frameshift predicted to result in premature
termination within the neck domain. The mutated alleles segregated with
the disorder in the family, and the mutation was not found in 334
northern European control chromosomes.

.0006
3MC SYNDROME 2
COLEC11, EX1-3DEL

In a male patient with 3MC syndrome-2 (265050) from the Italian family
originally reported by Carnevale et al. (1989), Rooryck et al. (2011)
identified homozygosity for a 27-kb deletion encompassing exons 1 to 3
of the COLEC11 gene, predicted to result in complete loss of the N
terminus and partial loss of the collagen-like domains of the protein.
Sequence analysis of the proximal and distal breakpoints of the junction
fragment revealed low copy repeat sequences (LCRs) corresponding to long
interspersed nuclear elements, suggesting that nonallelic homologous
recombination between these LCRs is the most probable mechanism
mediating this microdeletion in COLEC11. The mutated alleles segregated
with the disorder in the family and the mutation was not found in 286
northern European control chromosomes.
