DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The PGK1 gene encodes phosphoglycerate kinase-1, also known as
ATP:3-phosphoglycerate 1-phosphotransferase (EC 2.7.2.3), which
catalyzes the reversible conversion of 1,3-diphosphoglycerate to
3-phosphoglycerate during glycolysis, generating one molecule of ATP.

PGK1 is distinguished from testicular PGK2 (172270), which maps to
chromosome 6p21.

CLONING

Michelson et al. (1983) isolated a full-length cDNA clone of PGK from a
human fetal liver cDNA library using synthetic oligonucleotide mixtures
as hybridization probes. The deduced protein contains 417 amino acid
residues. Southern blot analysis of human genomic DNAs showed a complex
pattern of hybridizing fragments, 2 of which were non-X in origin. The
results were interpreted as reflecting the existence of a small family
of dispersed PGK or PGK-like genes.

Using a mixture of synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Singer-Sam et
al. (1983) isolated a cDNA encoding amino acids 291-296 of PGK.

GENE STRUCTURE

The human PGK1 gene contains 11 exons and spans approximately 23
kilobases (Michelson et al., 1985).

GENE FUNCTION

Disulfide bonds in secreted proteins are considered to be inert because
of the oxidizing nature of the extracellular milieu. An exception to
this rule is a reductase secreted by tumor cells that reduces disulfide
bonds in the serine proteinase plasmin. Reduction of plasmin initiates
proteolytic cleavage in the kringle 5 domain and release of the tumor
blood vessel inhibitor angiostatin. New blood vessel formation or
angiogenesis is critical for tumor expansion and metastasis. Lay et al.
(2000) showed that the plasmin reductase isolated from conditioned
medium of fibrosarcoma cells is the glycolytic enzyme phosphoglycerate
kinase. Recombinant phosphoglycerate kinase had the same specific
activity as the fibrosarcoma-derived protein. Plasma of mice bearing
fibrosarcoma tumors contained several-fold more phosphoglycerate kinase,
as compared with mice without tumors. Administration of phosphoglycerate
kinase to tumor-bearing mice caused an increase in plasma levels of
angiostatin, and a decrease in tumor vascularity and rate of tumor
growth. Lay et al. (2000) concluded that phosphoglycerate kinase not
only functions in glycolysis but is secreted by tumor cells and
participates in the angiogenic process as a disulfide reductase.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybridization, Grzeschik et al. (1972) concluded that
the PGK locus was on the long arm of the X chromosome. From the study of
chromosomal aberrations in cell hybridization systems, Ricciuti and
Ruddle (1973) concluded that the order on the X chromosome was
centromere--PGK--HPRT (308000)--G6PD (305900). The conclusion was based
on their own work with the KOP 14-X translocation, and on Park Gerald's
with a 19-X translocation and Bootsma's with a 3-X translocation. All 3
had breaks involving the long arm of the X chromosome, each at a
different site. From study of radiation-induced segregants in which
irradiated human cells are rescued by fusion with hamster cells, Goss
and Harris (1977) showed that the order of the 4 loci is PGK: alpha-GAL
(300644): HPRT: G6PD and that the 3 intervals between these 4 loci are,
in relative terms, 0.33, 0.30, and 0.23.

Willard et al. (1985) used a cDNA for human PGK to map the functional
PGK1 gene to Xq13. Evidence reported by Verga et al. (1991) suggested
that PGK1, which is distal to the Menkes disease gene (309400), may be
located in Xq13.3.

PGK is X-linked in the kangaroo (Cooper et al., 1971). Alpha-GALA, HPRT,
PGK and G6PD are X-linked in the rabbit, according to mouse-rabbit
hybrid cell studies (Cianfriglia et al., 1979; Echard and Gillois,
1979). By comparable methods, Hors-Cayla et al. (1979) found them to be
X-linked also in cattle. According to cell hybridization studies, HPRT,
G6PD and PGK are X-linked in the pig (Gellin et al., 1979) and in sheep
(Saidi et al., 1979).

- Pseudogenes

One pseudogene of PGK1 (PGK1P1) is on Xq at Xq11-Xq13, proximal to the
expressed PGK1 gene at Xq13 (Michelson et al., 1985; Willard et al.,
1985). The pseudogene was mapped by somatic hybrid cell and in situ
hybridization methods using a cloned DNA probe in each case.

Willard et al. (1985) identified a 10-kb PGK-related DNA sequence on
human chromosome 19, which the authors suggested could represent a
pseudogene, the putative testes-specific PGK gene, or some other related
gene. Gartler et al. (1986) mapped a 1-kb PGK sequence to chromosome 19,
which represents the second pseudogene PGK1P2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Chen et al. (1971) described an electrophoretic variant of PGK with
enzyme activity in the normal range. Using a PGK cDNA probe, Hutz et al.
(1984) identified a common DNA polymorphism with the restriction enzyme
PstI. About 48% of females in all ethnic groups were found to be
heterozygous. Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants were
tabulated by Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

- Phosphoglycerate Kinase-1 Deficiency

In a patient with chronic hemolytic anemia associated with deficiency of
PGK1 activity (300653), Fujii and Yoshida (1980) used peptide mapping
analysis to identify an arg206-to-pro (R206P; 311800.0002) substitution
in the PGK1 protein. The PGK1 variant was referred to as 'Uppsala.'

Sugie et al. (1998) described an 837T-C mutation (311800.0009) in the
PGK gene of a patient with PGK Hamamatsu and the myopathic form of PGK1
deficiency.

In 2 unrelated boys of Spanish origin with severe lifelong chronic
hemolytic anemia and progressive neurologic impairment, Noel et al.
(2005) identified 2 different mutations in the PGK1 gene (311800.0011
and 311800.0012, respectively).

Spiegel et al. (2009) reported an 18-year-old man of Arab Bedouin
descent with PGK1 deficiency confirmed by genetic analysis (T378P;
311800.0015). He had a purely myopathic phenotype, with onset of muscle
cramps and exercise-induced pigmenturia at age 7 years. He had no
evidence of hemolytic anemia or neurologic involvement; serum creatine
kinase was increased. Biochemical studies showed decreased PGK1 activity
in muscle (0.9% of control values) and erythrocytes (1.6%). The
patient's unaffected mother and 2 sisters were heterozygous for the
mutation.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PHOSPHOGLYCERATE KINASE 1 DEFICIENCY, MUNCHEN
PGK1, ASP268ASN

By peptide mapping analysis, Fujii et al. (1980) found an asp268-to-asn
(D268N) substitution in the PGK1 enzyme that was associated with mild
enzymatic deficiency (21% of normal activity) and was heat-unstable.
There was no hemolytic anemia or accumulation of intermediate
metabolites. Krietsch et al. (1977, 1980) described a large German
kindred with PGK Munchen. Although the variant showed decreased
activity, none of the carriers had overt clinical symptoms.

.0002
PHOSPHOGLYCERATE KINASE 1 DEFICIENCY, UPPSALA
PGK1, ARG206PRO

In a patient with chronic hemolytic anemia associated with deficiency of
PGK activity (300653), Fujii and Yoshida (1980) used peptide mapping
analysis to identify an arg206-to-pro (R206P) substitution in the PGK1
protein.

.0003
PHOSPHOGLYCERATE KINASE 1 DEFICIENCY, TOKYO
PGK1, VAL266MET

In a patient with chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia and neurologic
disturbances due to PGK1 deficiency (300653), Fujii et al. (1981) used
peptide mapping analysis to identify a val266-to-met (V266M)
substitution in the PGK1 enzyme. The variant enzyme had 16% activity
compared to controls.

.0004
PHOSPHOGLYCERATE KINASE 1, PGK II
PGK1, THR352ASN

Chen et al. (1971) found an electrophoretic polymorphism of PGK in a New
Guinea population, where the frequency of a variant enzyme, termed 'PGK
II,' showed a gene frequency of about 0.014. In starch gel
electrophoresis, the variant enzyme moved toward the anode faster than
the normal enzyme. Yoshida et al. (1972) found that the PGK II variant
had a substitution of threonine to asparagine. The same substitution was
found in a Samoan male. Fujii et al. (1981) stated that the thr-to-asn
change was at position 352. The variant was not associated with enzyme
deficiency.

.0005
PHOSPHOGLYCERATE KINASE 1 DEFICIENCY, MATSUE
PGK1, LEU88PRO

PGK Matsue is an electrophoretic variant associated with severe enzyme
deficiency, congenital nonspherocytic anemia, and mental disorders
(300653) (Miwa et al., 1972). In a cell line from a patient who died at
age 9 from complications of pneumonia, Maeda and Yoshida (1991), who
found a T/A-to-C/G transition in exon 3 of the PGK gene, resulting in a
leu88-to-pro (L88P) substitution. The nucleotide change created an
additional NciI cleavage site. Because the substitution was expected to
induce serious perturbation and instability in the protein structure,
Maeda and Yoshida (1991) suspected that the severe enzyme deficiency was
caused mainly by more rapid in vivo denaturation and degradation of the
variant enzyme.

Tani et al. (1985) found that PGK Matsue enzyme activity was about 5% of
control values. PGK Matsue mRNA was present in normal amounts in
fibroblasts, suggesting the enzyme deficiency was due to a 7- to 10-fold
increase in degradation of the mutant enzyme.

.0006
PHOSPHOGLYCERATE KINASE 1 DEFICIENCY, SHIZUOKA
PGK1, GLY157VAL

In a 27-year-old Japanese male with PGK1 deficiency (300653), Fujii et
al. (1992) identified a 473G-T transversion in the PGK1 gene, resulting
in a gly157-to-val (G157V) substitution The mutation created a new BstXI
cleavage site in exon 5. The patient had chronic hemolytic anemia and
myoglobinuria, manifested by nausea, anorexia, and muscle weakness after
exercise, beginning at the age of 10. There was no family history of
anemia or neuromuscular disease.

.0007
PHOSPHOGLYCERATE KINASE 1 DEFICIENCY, MICHIGAN
PGK1, CYS315ARG

In a 14-year-old boy with mental retardation, a behavior disorder, and
episodic hemolytic anemia due to PGK1 deficiency (300653), Maeda et al.
(1992) identified a T-to-C transition in exon 9 of the PGK1 gene,
resulting in a cys315-to-arg (C315R) substitution. The nucleotide
substitution created an additional AvaII cleavage site in the variant
gene. Since the variant gene was not detected in the proband's mother
and sibs, it must have originated by de novo mutation during oogenesis.
Because the variant was found in Michigan, it was designated 'PGK
Michigan.'

.0008
PHOSPHOGLYCERATE KINASE 1 DEFICIENCY, ALABAMA
PGK1, 3-BP DEL, LYS191DEL

In a 37-year-old white male school teacher with PGK1 deficiency
(300653), Yoshida et al. (1995) identified a 3-bp deletion in exon 7 of
the PGK gene, resulting in a deletion of lys191 in a highly conserved
region within alpha-helix 7 of the protein. The patient had had
infrequent episodes of jaundice prompting a diagnosis of hepatitis. The
authors noted that deletion of lysine could cause molecular instability,
as suggested by the rapid in vitro inactivation of the variant PGK in
this patient.

.0009
PHOSPHOGLYCERATE KINASE 1 DEFICIENCY, HAMAMATSU
PGK1, ILE252THR

In an 11-year-old boy with PGK1 deficiency (300653), Sugie et al. (1998)
identified an 837T-C transition in the PGK1 gene, resulting in an
ile252-to-thr (I252T) substitution. The boy was mentally retarded and
had had recurrent episodes of convulsions followed by generalized
myalgia, muscle weakness, and pigmenturia.

Bischof et al. (2006) demonstrated that the I252T mutation originates by
gene conversion from a processed pseudogene. A PGK1 pseudogene (PGK1P1)
carries the 837T-C transition that produces the I252T substitution
associated with phosphoglycerate kinase deficiency.

.0010
PHOSPHOGLYCERATE KINASE 1 DEFICIENCY, HERLEV
PGK1, ASP285VAL

In a Danish patient with PGK1 deficiency (300653), Valentin et al.
(1998) identified an asp285-to-val (D285V) substitution in the PGK1
gene. The patient had isolated hemolytic anemia without neurologic or
muscular disorders. The mutated gene was expressed only partially; both
normal and substituted nucleotides were found at the same position in a
ratio of approximately 1:9. Valentin et al. (1998) presumed that somatic
mutation with mosaicism was the likely explanation for the relatively
mild phenotype.

.0011
PHOSPHOGLYCERATE KINASE 1 DEFICIENCY, BARCELONA
PGK1, ILE46ASN

In a Spanish boy with PGK1 deficiency (300653), Noel et al. (2005)
identified a 140T-A transversion in the PGK1 gene, resulting in an
ile46-to-asn (I46N) substitution. He had a long history of chronic
hemolytic anemia and progressive neurologic impairment leading to mental
deterioration. No muscular dystrophy could be demonstrated. The mutation
was present in heterozygous state in the patient's mother. Based on the
crystal structure of porcine PGK, the I46N mutation did not modify any
of the PGK binding sites for ATP or 3PG, so the consequences must be
related to a loss of the enzyme stability rather than a decrease of
enzyme catalytic function.

.0012
PHOSPHOGLYCERATE KINASE 1 DEFICIENCY, MURCIA
PGK1, SER319ASN

In a boy from Murcia with PGK1 deficiency (300653), Noel et al. (2005)
identified a 958G-A transition in the PGK1 gene, resulting in a
ser319-to-asn (S319N) substitution. He had severe hemolytic anemia,
encephalopathy, and seizures, and died at age 7 years. His mother and
sister were heterozygous for the mutation. Based on the crystal
structure of porcine PGK, the S319N mutation did not modify any of the
PGK binding sites for ATP or 3PG, so the consequences must be related to
a loss of the enzyme stability rather than a decrease of enzyme
catalytic function.

.0013
PHOSPHOGLYCERATE KINASE 1 DEFICIENCY, AMIENS
PGK1, ASP164VAL

In 2 affected boys of a white American family with PGK1 deficiency
(300653), Flanagan et al. (2006) identified a 491A-T transversion in
exon 5 of the PGK1 gene, resulting in an asp164-to-val (D164V)
substitution. The 2 boys presented with hemolytic anemia, seizures, and
developmental delay. The diagnosis of PGK deficiency was based on an
erythrocyte PGK enzyme activity level of less than 5% of normal and
identification of the D164V mutation. This mutation had previously been
designated PGK-Amiens and described in a French PGK patient (Cohen-Solal
et al., 1994) and in a large family of Chinese extraction living in New
York (Valentine et al., 1969; Turner et al., 1995). The proband in the
family reported by Flanagan et al. (2006) also had hemiplegic migraines,
retinal dystrophy, and muscle fatigue. The 3 families in which this
mutation had been described appeared to represent recurrent mutations.

This variant has also been referred to as PGK NEW YORK.

.0014
PHOSPHOGLYCERATE KINASE 1 DEFICIENCY, FUKUROI
PGK1, IVS7DS, G-A, +5

In a 33-year-old Japanese man with PGK1 deficiency (300653), Shirakawa
et al. (2006) identified a G-to-A transition in intron 7 of the PGK1
gene, resulting in aberrant splicing and a catalytically inactive
protein. The patient had mental retardation and exertional
myoglobinuria, but no evidence of hemolytic anemia. PGK1 enzyme activity
was 8.9% and 13.6% of control values in muscle and red blood cells,
respectively.

.0015
PHOSPHOGLYCERATE KINASE 1 DEFICIENCY, AFULA
PGK1, THR378PRO

In an 18-year-old man of Arab Bedouin descent with PGK1 deficiency
(300653), Spiegel et al. (2009) identified a 1132A-C transversion in
exon 10 of the PGK1 gene, resulting in a thr378-to-pro (T378P)
substitution in a highly conserved residue. The patient had a myopathic
phenotype, with onset of muscle cramps and exercise-induced pigmenturia
at age 7 years. He had no evidence of hemolytic anemia or neurologic
involvement; serum creatine kinase was increased. Protein structural
analysis predicted that the mutation would destabilize an alpha-helix
and interfere with the contact of domains responsible for proper
catalytic interactions with nucleotide phosphates. Biochemical studies
showed decreased PGK1 activity in muscle (0.9% of control values) and
erythrocytes (1.6%). The patient's unaffected mother and 2 sisters were
heterozygous for the mutation.

612256	TITLE *612256 MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED SERINE/THREONINE KINASE 1; MAST1
;;SYNTROPHIN-ASSOCIATED SERINE/THREONINE KINASE; SAST;;
KIAA0973
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned MAST1, which they designated
KIAA0973. The deduced 1,583-amino acid protein shares significant
similarity with mouse Mast205 (MAST2; 612257). RT-PCR ELISA detected
high expression in adult brain, spinal cord, and testis, in fetal brain,
and in all specific adult brain regions examined. Expression was
moderate in ovary, kidney, and fetal liver, low in pancreas, and very
low or undetectable in all other tissues examined.

Yano et al. (2003) cloned 2 splice variants of rat Sast that they
designated Sast170 and Sast124 after the calculated molecular masses of
the proteins. Both proteins contain a central serine/threonine kinase
domain, followed by a PDZ domain, but the smaller protein has a shorter
and unique C-terminal region. PCR analysis of rat tissues showed that,
like Sast170, Sast124 was expressed exclusively in brain.
Immunohistochemical analysis detected strong Sast124 staining in neurons
of the subventricular zone and granule cells of the olfactory bulb,
islands of Calleja, hippocampal dentate gyrus, and cerebellum. Sast124
localized in nuclei of neurons, in glia-like cell bodies in the corpus
callosum, and in fiber bundles in the spinal trigeminal and solitary
tracts.

GENE FUNCTION

Valiente et al. (2005) showed that the C-terminal tail of human PTEN
(601728) bound to the PDZ domains of rat Magi2 (606382), Magi3, and Dlg
(DLG1; 601014), mouse Sast and Mast205, and human MAST3 (612258).
Interaction of PTEN with Magi2 increased PTEN protein stability, and
interaction of PTEN with the MAST kinases facilitated phosphorylation of
PTEN by these kinases.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1999) mapped the MAST1 gene
to chromosome 19.

;;LOK
DESCRIPTION Kuramochi et al. (1997) cloned the mouse gene Stk10, coding for a new
serine/threonine kinase, designated LOK. Kuramochi et al. (1999)
described the cloning of a cDNA encoding the human homolog and the
detection of LOK proteins in human lymphoid cells. They deposited the
sequence of a human LOK cDNA in GenBank (GENBANK AB015718). They also
determined the chromosomal location of the gene by fluorescence in situ
hybridization: 5q35.1 in human, 11A4 in mouse, and 10q12.3 in rat. By
means of polymorphic CA repeats found in the 3-prime untranslated region
of the mouse Stk10 gene and an intersubspecific backcross mapping panel,
they mapped the Stk10 locus to a restricted region on chromosome 11
between D11Mit53 and D11Mit84. These results established STK10 as a new
marker of human chromosome 5 to define the syntenic boundary of human
chromosomes 5 and 16 on mouse chromosome 11.

602031	TITLE *602031 PROTEIN GERANYLGERANYLTRANSFERASE TYPE I, BETA SUBUNIT; PGGT1B
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Protein geranylgeranyltransferase type I (GGTase-I) transfers a
geranylgeranyl group to the cysteine residue of candidate proteins
containing a C-terminal CAAX motif in which 'A' is an aliphatic amino
acid and 'X' is leucine. The enzyme is composed of a 48-kD alpha subunit
(FNTA; 134635) and a 43-kD beta subunit, encoded by the PGGT1B gene. The
FNTA gene encodes the alpha subunit for both GGTase-I and the related
enzyme farnesyltransferase (summary by Zhang et al., 1994).

CLONING

Zhang et al. (1994) obtained overlapping cDNA clones containing the
complete coding sequences of the genes encoding the rat and human beta
subunits (PGGT1B). The sequences from both species encode a 377-amino
acid polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 42.4 kD (human) and
42.5 kD (rat). Amino acid sequence comparisons suggested that the
mammalian beta-subunit protein is the counterpart of the Saccharomyces
cerevisiae gene CDC43. Zhang et al. (1994) coexpressed the beta-subunit
cDNA and an FNTA cDNA in E. coli and produced recombinant GGTase-I with
electrophoretic and enzymatic properties indistinguishable from those of
native GGTase-I.

ANIMAL MODEL

Lee et al. (2010) used conditional knockout alleles for Fntb (134636),
which encodes the beta subunit of farnesyltransferase (FTase), Pggt1b,
and a keratin-14 (KRT14; 148066)-Cre transgene to create mice lacking
FTase or GGTase-I in skin keratinocytes. Keratinocyte-specific Fntb
knockout mice were viable but developed severe alopecia. The
interfollicular epidermis of Fntb-deficient mice appeared normal;
however, keratinocytes from these mice could not proliferate in culture.
As expected, nonfarnesylated prelamin A (LMNA; 150330) and
nonfarnesylated DNAJA1 (602837) accumulated in Fntb-deficient
keratinocytes. Keratinocyte-specific Pggt1b knockout mice survived
development but died shortly after birth. Like Fntb-deficient
keratinocytes, Pggt1b-deficient keratinocytes did not proliferate in
culture. Lee et al. (2010) concluded that both FTase and GGTase-I are
required for the homeostasis of skin keratinocytes.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mitochondria have their own translation system for production of 13
proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation. MRPL32 is 1 of more
than 70 protein components of mitochondrial ribosomes that are encoded
by the nuclear genome (Kenmochi et al., 2001).

CLONING

By searching databases using bovine Mrpl32 as query, followed by PCR of
human genomic DNA, Kenmochi et al. (2001) cloned MRPL32.

By radiation hybrid analysis and analysis of an integrated BAC-STS map,
Kenmochi et al. (2001) mapped the MRPL32 gene to chromosome 7p14.

603726	TITLE *603726 FIBROBLAST GROWTH FACTOR 18; FGF18
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The fibroblast growth factors (FGFs; e.g., FGF2; 134920) are a family of
growth factors and oncogenes that contain a conserved, approximately
120-amino acid core. Individual FGFs play important roles in embryonic
development, cell growth, morphogenesis, tissue repair, inflammation,
angiogenesis, and tumor growth and invasion.

CLONING

Ohbayashi et al. (1998) isolated human, mouse, and rat cDNAs encoding a
novel member of the FGF family, FGF18. The deduced 207-amino acid human
and rat FGF18 proteins are 99% identical. FGF18 contains a typical
hydrophobic signal sequence at its N terminus. Northern blot analysis of
rat adult tissues showed abundant expression of Fgf18 in lung but did
not detect Fgf18 expression in other tissues. In rat 14.5- and 19.5-day
embryos, in situ hybridization showed Fgf18 expression in several
discrete regions.

Independently, Hu et al. (1998) isolated human and mouse FGF18 cDNAs.
Among known FGF family members, the FGF18 protein is most similar to
FGF8 (600483) and FGF17 (603725), with human FGF18 showing 60% and 58%
identity with human FGF8 and FGF17, respectively. Northern blot analysis
of mouse adult tissues showed highest Fgf18 expression in the lung and
kidney, and in situ hybridization of mouse 15.5-day embryos detected
Fgf18 transcripts primarily in the lung.

GENE FUNCTION

Ohbayashi et al. (1998) demonstrated that recombinant rat Fgf18 can be
efficiently secreted by High Five insect cells. Recombinant rat Fgf18
induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells.

Hu et al. (1998) demonstrated that recombinant mouse Fgf18 is
glycosylated and can stimulate proliferation of NIH 3T3 cells in vitro
in a heparan sulfate-dependent manner. Injection of recombinant mouse
Fgf18 into normal mice induced proliferation in a wide variety of
tissues, with the liver and small intestine appearing to be the primary
targets. Hu et al. (1998) showed that transgenic mice overexpressing
Fgf18 in the liver exhibited an increase in liver weight and
hepatocellular proliferation.

Using primary cultures and established mouse cell lines, Shimoaka et al.
(2002) studied the effects of Fgf18 on growth and differentiation of
mouse osteoblasts and chondrocytes. Fgf18 stimulated proliferation and
inhibited differentiation and matrix synthesis in all cultures. Fgf18
also upregulated the phosphorylation of ERK (see MAPK3; 601795) in both
osteoblasts and chondrocytes, and it upregulated phosphorylation of p38
MAPK (600289) specifically in chondrocytes. The mitogenic action of
Fgf18 was blocked by inhibitors of ERK and p38 MAPK. Fgf18 induced
osteoclast formation through RANKL (602642) and cyclooxygenase-2
(600262) and stimulated osteoclasts to form resorbed pits on a cultured
mouse dentin slice. Shimoaka et al. (2002) noted that these effects were
similar to those of FGF2 and proposed that FGF18 and FGF2 may be
redundant in their effects on bone and cartilage.

By in situ hybridization of normal fetal mice, Whitsett et al. (2002)
found expression of Fgf18 in stromal cells surrounding proximal airway
cartilage and in peripheral lung mesenchyme. Conditional overexpression
of Fgf18 in lung epithelial cells during fetal development disrupted
branching morphogenesis of the lung. There was an increase in the length
and caliber of conducting airways and decreased branching of peripheral
airways with a marked reduction in peripheral saccules. Transgenic mice
also showed abnormal smooth muscle and cartilage in the walls of
expanded distal airways, which were accompanied by atypically large
pulmonary blood vessels. Expression of proteins normally expressed in
peripheral lung tubules, including SP-B (178640) and SP-C (178620), was
inhibited.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis and FISH, Whitmore et al. (2000) mapped the
FGF18 gene to chromosome 5q34.

ANIMAL MODEL

Ohbayashi et al. (2002) noted that Fgf18 is expressed in both osteogenic
mesenchymal cells and in differentiating osteoblasts during calvarial
bone development in mouse. By gene targeting, they developed
Fgf18-deficient mice. Mutant mice showed delayed suture closure of
calvarial bone. Proliferation of calvarial osteogenic mesenchymal cells
was decreased, and terminal differentiation to calvarial osteoblasts was
specifically delayed. Delay of osteogenic differentiation was also
observed in developing long bones of mutant mice. Conversely,
chondrocyte proliferation and the number of differentiated chondrocytes
were increased. Ohbayashi et al. (2002) concluded that Fgf18 has a
positive effect in osteogenesis and a negative effect in chondrogenesis
in mice.

613210	TITLE *613210 WD REPEAT-CONTAINING PROTEIN 85; WDR85
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

WDR85 is a WD repeat-containing protein that plays a role in the first
step of diphthamide biosynthesis (Carette et al., 2009).

CLONING

Using insertional mutagenesis to develop a screening method to generate
null alleles in a human cell line haploid for all chromosomes except
chromosome 8, Carette et al. (2009) identified the WDR85 gene as
implicated in resistance to both diphtheria and anthrax toxins. WDR85 is
a conserved protein with homology to yeast YBR246W, which is also
involved in diphthamide biosynthesis. WDR85 contains WD40 repeats, often
involved in protein-protein interactions. Carette et al. (2009)
suggested that WDR85 may serve as a scaffold to coordinate the
association (or dissociation) of enzymatic complexes required for the
stepwise biosynthesis of diphthamide. Diphtheria toxin and exotoxin A
inhibit host translation through ADP ribosylation of elongation factor-2
(EF2; 130610) and thus cause cell death (Collier, 2001). ADP
ribosylation occurs on diphthamide, a posttranslationally modified
histidine uniquely present in EF2 and conserved among all eukaryotes.
Carette et al. (2009) found that the absence of modified histidine-175
in EF2 in the presence of mutant WDR85 suggested that WDR85 plays a role
in the first step in diphthamide biosynthesis.

MAPPING

Hartz (2010) mapped the WDR85 gene to chromosome 9q34.3 based on an
alignment of the WDR85 sequence GenBank (GENBANK BC017335) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;ANKYRIN REPEAT-CONTAINING COFACTOR 1; ANCO1;;
NASOPHARYNGEAL CARCINOMA SUSCEPTIBILITY PROTEIN;;
T13;;
LZ16
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ANKRD11 is a member of a family of ankyrin repeat-containing cofactors
that interacts with p160 nuclear receptor coactivators (see NCOA1;
602691) and inhibits ligand-dependent transcriptional activation (Zhang
et al., 2004).

CLONING

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis with the conserved N-terminal basic
helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain of p160 nuclear receptor coactivator RAC3
(NCOA3; 601937) as bait, Zhang et al. (2004) cloned ANKRD11, which they
called ANCO1. The deduced 2,663-amino acid protein had a calculated
molecular mass of 298 kD and contained five 33-amino acid ankyrin
repeats, a highly charged central region, and many putative nuclear
localization signals. Zhang et al. (2004) found that ANCO1 is identical
to the previously isolated nasopharyngeal carcinoma susceptibility
protein LZ16. Northern blot analysis detected a 10-kb transcript in many
human tissues and cancer cell lines, with highest expression in skeletal
muscle and chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cells. Smaller transcripts of
3.5 and 7.5 kb were detected. Immunofluorescence studies localized ANCO1
to discrete nuclear foci that colocalized with histone deacetylaces
HDAC3 (605166), HDAC4 (605314), and HDAC5 (605315) specifically.

Using nonquantitative RT-PCR, Sirmaci et al. (2011) confirmed expression
of ANKRD11 in the human adult brain. Examination of transfected mouse
neonatal cerebral cortical primary cultures using fluorescence
microscopy revealed that ANKRD11 localized mainly to the nuclei of
neurons and glial cells and only a relatively small amount was localized
in the cytoplasm. Depolarization of the cells significantly induced
nuclear accumulation of ANKRD11 in discrete inclusions.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Zhang et al. (2004) mapped the ANKRD11
gene to chromosome 16q24.3.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid and GST pull-down studies, Zhang et al. (2004)
demonstrated that the C-terminal amino acids of ANCO1 (2597-2663) bound
p160 nuclear coactivators RAC3, TIF2 (NCOA2; 601993), and SRC1 (NCOA1;
602691). By GST pull-down assay and coimmunoprecipitation studies, the
authors showed that ANCO1 bound histone deacetylases HDAC3, HDAC4, and
HDAC5 via an HDAC binding domain distinct from the ANCO1 p160
coactivator binding domain. Overexpression of ANCO1 inhibited
transcriptional activation by nuclear receptors, including the
mineralocorticoid (NR3C2; 600983), androgen (AR; 313700), progesterone
(PGR; 607311), and glucocorticoid (GCCR; 138040) receptors. The results
of competition studies with ANCO1 and p160 coactivator TIF2 suggested to
Zhang et al. (2004) that ANCO1 inhibits ligand-dependent transactivation
by recruiting HDACs to the coactivator/nuclear receptor complex.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a Turkish family with macrodontia, mental retardation, characteristic
facies, short stature, and skeletal anomalies (KBG syndrome, KBGS;
148050), originally reported by Tekin et al. (2004), Sirmaci et al.
(2011) performed whole-exome capture followed by next-generation
sequencing and identified a heterozygous splice site variant in the
ANKRD11 gene (611192.0001) that segregated with disease and was not
found in ethnically matched controls. Analysis of ANKRD11 in 9
additional KBGS probands revealed heterozygosity for truncating
mutations in 4 of them (see, e.g., 611192.0002 and 611192.0003). All 5
mutations involved the highly conserved C-terminal repression domain of
ANKRD11.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
KBG SYNDROME
ANKRD11, IVS10, G-C, -1

In a father and 2 sons from a Turkish family with KBG syndrome (148050),
originally reported by Tekin et al. (2004), Sirmaci et al. (2011)
identified heterozygosity for a G-C transversion at the splice acceptor
site (7570-1G-C) in intron 10 of the ANKRD11 gene, resulting in the
deletion of 2 residues located in the highly conserved C-terminal
repression domain. The mutation was not found in the unaffected mother
or in 339 Turkish controls. The 46-year-old father, who was the oldest
affected individual studied by Sirmaci et al. (2011), had developed
moderate kyphosis and osteopenia with age.

In a 16-year-old Turkish boy with KBG syndrome (148050), Sirmaci et al.
(2011) identified heterozygosity for a de novo 1-bp deletion (2305delT)
in exon 9 of the ANKRD11 gene, causing a frameshift predicted to result
in a premature termination codon. The mutation was not found in his
unaffected parents or in 255 Turkish controls. Real-time PCR analysis of
peripheral blood RNA from the patient demonstrated reduction of ANKRD11
expression compared to his father.

In a 21-year-old Italian man with KBG syndrome (148050), originally

heterozygosity for a de novo 2-bp deletion (5953delCA) in exon 9 of the
ANKRD11 gene, causing a frameshift predicted to result in a premature
termination codon. The mutation was not found in his unaffected parents
or in 40 Italian controls.

610323	TITLE *610323 METADHERIN; MTDH
;;METASTASIS ADHESION PROTEIN;;
LYRIC;;
ASTROCYTE ELEVATED GENE 1; AEG1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Brown and Ruoslahti (2004) cloned mouse metadherin from phage expression
libraries of mammary tumor cell line cDNAs based on the ability of
metadherin to direct phage to the lung following injection into nude
mice. Metadherin has a transmembrane domain in its N-terminal half and a
lung-homing domain in its long C-terminal half. Flow cytometry showed
that endogenous metadherin was expressed on the surface of
nonpermeabilized mouse mammary tumor cells with the lung-homing domain
on the extracellular side. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed high
expression of metadherin in human breast cancer sections, but not in
normal human breast tissue. In normal mouse, staining was detected at
the apical surface of epithelial cells lining ducts of the mammary
gland, and a small amount was expressed in the mammary fat pad.
Metadherin was also highly expressed in Purkinje neurons in the early
postnatal and adult cerebellum. Minute amounts were detected in liver,
but metadherin was not detected in any other mouse tissue examined.

By searching BAC clones for sequences similar to rat Lyric, Britt et al.
(2004) identified human LYRIC. The deduced 582-amino acid protein has an
N-terminal transmembrane region, 2 nuclear localization sequences, a
potential ATP/GTP-binding site, and a number of putative phosphorylation
sites. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.5-kb LYRIC transcript in
human prostate and breast cell lines. Lyric was expressed in all rat
tissues examined, with highest expression in liver, kidney, prostate,
and small intestine. Western blot analysis detected human LYRIC proteins
of about 80 and 70 kD in a prostate cell line. Experiments in human and
rat tissues and cell lines showed colocalization of LYRIC with ZO1
(TJP1; 601009) and occludin (OCLN; 602876) at tight junctions in
polarized epithelial cells. In cells lacking tight junctions, LYRIC was
cytoplasmic.

Sutherland et al. (2004) cloned mouse and human MTDH, which they called
3D3/LYRIC. They identified 3 nuclear localization signals and putative
dileucine repeats, which are involved in protein trafficking. Northern
blot analysis detected multiple transcripts in mouse tissues. Western
blot analysis of mouse and human cell lines revealed several LYRIC
proteins, the largest of which was 80 kD. Cell fractionation and
immunostaining showed predominant LYRIC localization in the endoplasmic
reticulum of human and mouse cells, but it also localized to the nuclear
envelope and in the nucleolus.

Kang et al. (2005) cloned MTDH, which they called AEG1, from a primary
human fetal astrocyte cDNA library. Northern blot analysis detected 4-,
6-, and 9-kb transcripts in all tissues examined. Expression was highest
in muscular organs, such as skeletal muscle, heart, tongue, and small
intestine, and in endocrine glands, including thyroid and adrenal gland.
Northern blot analysis of human cancer cells revealed a transcripts of
1.5, 4, and 9 kb.

GENE FUNCTION

Brown and Ruoslahti (2004) found that, following injection in nude mice,
human embryonic kidney cells expressing mouse metadherin accumulated in
lung. Antibodies reactive to the lung-homing domain of metadherin
inhibited lung metastasis by about 40%. Treatment of metadherin-positive
mouse cells with small interfering RNA did not affect cell viability or
alter the rate of cell growth, but it reduced lung metastases by about
80%.

Britt et al. (2004) found that LYRIC did not colocalize to tight
junctions in human or rat cells or tissues in the absence of ZO1. LYRIC
dissociated from ZO1 when junctional complexes were disrupted, and as
tight junctions reformed, ZO1 relocalized before LYRIC. Britt et al.
(2004) concluded that LYRIC is not required for tight junction
formation, but it is recruited during maturation of the tight junction
complex.

Kang et al. (2005) found that infection of primary human fetal
astrocytes with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) or treatment with
the HIV-1 gp120 protein or TNF-alpha (TNF; 191160) resulted in elevated
AEG1 expression and decreased EAAT2 (SLC1A2; 600300) expression.
Reporter gene assays showed that AEG1 specifically inhibited EAAT2
promoter activity, but it did not affect EAAT1 (SLC1A3; 600111) promoter
activity. Ectopic expression of AEG1 in an immortalized human melanocyte
cell line promoted anchorage-independent growth.

Lee et al. (2006) found that overexpression of HRAS (190020) in cultured
human and rat cells increased AEG1 expression via the PIK3 signaling
pathway. Activation of 2 E-box elements in the AEG1 promoter by
increased MYC (190080) binding was critical for HRAS-mediated AEG1
induction. Lee et al. (2006) also showed that AEG1 knockdown by small
interfering RNA inhibited HRAS-mediated colony formation.

Kikuno et al. (2007) found that AEG1 was overexpressed in prostate
cancer tissue samples and in cultured prostate cancer cell lines
compared with normal controls. Knockdown of AEG1 induced apoptosis in
the prostate cancer cell lines and reduced their invasive properties.
Apoptosis was induced through upregulation of FOXO3A (602681) activity,
which was dependent on reduced AKT (see 164730) activity in cells with
high constitutive AKT activity, but not in cells with low constitutive
AKT activity. AEG1 knockdown also attenuated the constitutive activities
of NF-kappa-B (see 164011) and AP1 (165160), with corresponding
depletion in the expression of NF-kappa-B and AP1 target genes.

Yoo et al. (2009) found that expression of AEG1 was significantly
elevated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; see 114550) compared with
normal human hepatocytes. Stable expression of AEG1 increased the
aggressiveness of nontumorigenic human HCC cells, and inhibition of AEG1
abrogated tumorigenesis by aggressive HCC cells in a xenograft model of
nude mice. In humans, AEG1 overexpression was associated with elevated
copy number. Microarray analysis revealed that AEG1 modulated the
expression of genes associated with invasion, metastasis,
chemoresistance, angiogenesis, and senescence. AEG1 specifically
activated Wnt (see 164820)/beta-catenin (CTNNB1; 116806) signaling,
resulting in upregulation of LEF1 (153245), the ultimate executor of the
Wnt signaling pathway. AEG1 also activated the NF-kappa-B (see 164011)
pathway, which may play a role in the chronic inflammatory changes
preceding HCC development. Yoo et al. (2009) concluded that AEG1 plays a
central role in HCC pathogenesis.

By cDNA microarray, Western blot analysis, and luciferase reporter
assay, Yoo et al. (2009) found significant upregulation of the
transcription factor LSF (TFCP2; 189889) and increased LSF
transcriptional activity in the nuclei of hepatocellular carcinoma cells
expressing AEG1 compared to HCC cells without AEG1 expression. The
increase in LSF activity correlated with significant increases in the
downstream targets thymidylate synthetase (TYMS; 188350) during the
growth cycle and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPYD; 612779). The
AEG1-transfected HCC cells showed more resistance to 5-fluorouracil
(5-FU) treatment compared to those without AEG1 expression, which could
be explained by the upregulation of both TYMS and DPYD. Studies with
siRNA targeting AEG1, LSF, or DPYD abrogated the 5-FU resistance. In
nude xenograft mice transfected with an HCC cell line that expressed
AEG1 and showed resistance to 5-FU, inhibition of AEG1 resulted in
significant inhibition in tumor growth, and a combination of 5-FU and
AEG1 inhibition resulted in an additive effect on tumor growth
inhibition. The findings demonstrated that AEG1 confers resistance to
5-FU by inducing the expression of LSF and DPYD, and pointed to a
central role of AEG1 in HCC development and progression.

Lee et al. (2009) found that AEG1 was overexpressed in neuroblastoma
patient samples and cell lines compared with normal peripheral nerve
tissues, normal astrocytes, and normal immortalized melanocytes.
Overexpression of AEG1 converted nontumorigenic neuroblastoma cells into
highly proliferative and aggressive tumor cells. Conversely, knockdown
of AEG1 blocked tumorigenic properties of highly aggressive
neuroblastoma cells. Biochemical and inhibitor studies revealed that
AEG1 activated the PI3K (see 601232)-AKT signaling pathway, resulting in
induction of MYCN (164840) expression in neuroblastoma.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sutherland et al. (2004) determined that the MTDH gene contains 12 exons
and spans about 95 kb.

MAPPING

By FISH and genomic sequence analysis, Sutherland et al. (2004) mapped
the MTDH gene to chromosome 8q23. They mapped the mouse Mtdh gene to a
region of chromosome 15 that shares homology of synteny with human
chromosome 8q23. By genomic sequence analysis, Kang et al. (2005) mapped
the MTDH gene to chromosome 8q22.

604682	TITLE *604682 INTEGRIN, ALPHA-E; ITGAE
;;CD103 ANTIGEN;;
HUMAN MUCOSAL LYMPHOCYTE ANTIGEN 1, ALPHA SUBUNIT
DESCRIPTION Integrins are a family of cell surface adhesion molecules that play a
major role in diverse cellular and developmental processes including
morphogenesis, hemostasis, leukocyte activation, cellular adhesion, and
homing. Each integrin consists of a pair of noncovalently associated
alpha and beta chains. Integrin alpha-chain sequences are characterized
by a 7-fold repeated amino acid motif, of which the last 3 or 4 contain
divalent cation-binding sites. Immune responses at mucosal sites are
mediated by lymphocytes associated with mammary glands and the
gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and respiratory tracts. Among these
mucosal lymphocytes are intraepithelial T lymphocytes (IELs).
Cerf-Bensussan et al. (1987) determined that an integrin, termed HML-1
for human mucosal lymphocyte antigen-1, is found on more than 90% of
intestinal IELs (iIELs) and on 45 to 50% of lamina propria T cells but
on less than 2% of circulating peripheral blood T cells. Parker et al.
(1992) showed that the beta subunit of HML-1 is integrin beta-7 (ITGB7;
147559).

By immunoaffinity column chromatography and SDS-PAGE, Shaw et al. (1994)
purified the alpha chain of HML-1, which they designated alpha-E
integrin for 'epithelial-associated.' Using degenerate PCR primers to
screen an iIEL cDNA library treated with TGFB1 (190180), which is known
to induce CD103 (ITGAE), Shaw et al. (1994) isolated an ITGAE cDNA, a
1,160-amino acid protein. ITGAE shares overall homology with other alpha
integrins but has a unique 55-amino acid 'extra' region located just
N-terminal to the I domain that contains 18 consecutive charged residues
and a proteolytic cleavage site. The authors found that 14 of 25
cysteine residues are conserved between alpha-E and other alpha integrin
chains, as are all 7 repeat regions and the GFFKR (gly-phe-phe-lys-arg)
cytoplasmic sequence. There are 10 potential N-glycosylation sites.
Western blot analysis showed that ITGAE is expressed as a 150-kD
protein. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a single ITGAE
transcript of 4.5 kb in iIEL. Weak expression was detected in lung,
pancreas, spleen, thymus, prostate, testis, ovary, small intestine,
colon, and peripheral blood leukocytes. T-cell tumors expressed the
4.5-kb transcript as well as 2.3- and 1.3-kb transcripts.

Schon et al. (1999) showed that Itgae-deficient mice had an altered
distribution of T lymphocytes within epithelia and the intestinal lamina
propria, probably due to their loss of ability to bind to CDH1 (192090).

By SSCP analysis, Schon et al. (1999) mapped Itgae1 to mouse chromosome
11. Touchman et al. (2000) mapped the ITGAE gene to chromosome 17p13 by
inclusion within a BAC contig.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Phospholipases A2 (PLA2s) catalyze hydrolysis of the sn-2 acyl-ester
bonds in phospholipids, leading to the release of arachidonic acid and
other fatty acids. PLA2G6 is a calcium-independent PLA2 (Forsell et al.,
1999).

CLONING

Tang et al. (1997) purified an 85-kD cytosolic calcium-independent PLA2,
termed iPLA2, from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. They isolated a
partial human cDNA from a Burkitt lymphoma cDNA library by screening
with a CHO cDNA. Northern blot analysis revealed that iPLA2 is expressed
in a variety of rodent tissues.

Larsson et al. (1998) cloned human iPLA2 cDNAs and discovered multiple
mRNA isoforms resulting from alternative splicing. The full-length cDNA
encodes an 806-amino acid protein with a lipase motif and 8 ankyrin
repeats. Human and rodent iPLA2 share 90% overall amino acid sequence
identity, with the human sequence differing in containing a 54-residue
insertion that would interrupt the last putative ankyrin repeat. Two of
the alternatively spliced forms encode only the ankyrin repeat region of
the protein. Coexpression of these variants with the active iPLA2 enzyme
resulted in a decrease of the enzyme's activity.

By computational analysis, Forsell et al. (1999) identified several
human iPLA2 variants that were alternatively spliced at exons 3, 9, 9a,
and 10a, as well as part of exon 14. Northern blot analysis detected
iPLA2 transcripts of 1.8, 2.0, 3.2, and 4.2 kb. The 2.0-kb variant was
expressed at variable levels in all tissues examined, the 3.2-kb and
4.2-kb transcripts were expressed at variable levels in most tissues
examined, and the 1.8-kb transcript was expressed predominantly in heart
and skeletal muscle, with lower levels in bone marrow. Western blot
analysis of fractionated transfected COS-7 cells showed that full-length
human iPLA2 associated with membranes. Hydropathy plot and bioinformatic
analyses suggested that iPLA2 contains 2 hydrophobic regions that may be
transmembrane domains.

Using rat iPla2 to screen a human insulinoma cDNA library, followed by
RT-PCR of human islet RNA, Ma et al. (1999) cloned long and short iPLA2
splice variants. The short variant lacks an insert encoding a 54-amino
acid proline-rich region in the long variant. This insert interrupts the
last putative ankyrin repeat and is likely to function as a linker
region that separates the N-terminal protein-binding domain from the
C-terminal catalytic domain. RT-PCR detected these 2 transcripts in a
human promonocytic cell line and in normal islet cells. SDS-PAGE showed
that the recombinant short and long isoforms of human iPLA2 had apparent
molecular masses of 85 kD and 88 kD, respectively.

GENE STRUCTURE

Forsell et al. (1999) determined that the PLA2G6 gene contains 19 exons,
including the alternative exons 9a and 10a, and spans more than 69 kb.
The promoter region lacks a TATA box, but contains a CpG island and
several potential SP1 (189906)-binding sites. The 5-prime flanking
region also contains an inverted MER53 sequence and an Alu element.

MAPPING

Ma et al. (1999) mapped the PLA2G6 gene to chromosome 22q13.1 by FISH.

GENE FUNCTION

Tang et al. (1997) found that expression of the hamster iPla2 cDNA
generated an active 85-kD protein that selectively hydrolyzed sn-2 over
sn-1 fatty acids.

Forsell et al. (1999) found that COS-7 cells expressing full-length
human iPLA2 and rat vascular smooth muscle cells showed
Ca(2+)-independent release of arachidonic acid from radiolabeled
phospholipids, and that the activity was associated with the membrane
fractions.

Ma et al. (1999) found that both recombinant short and long isoforms of
human iPLA2 had Ca(2+)-independent PLA2 activity in cytosolic and
membrane fractions. Their activities were inhibited by bromoenol
lactone, an iPLA2 suicide substrate. The long iPLA2 isoform, but not the
short isoform, was activated by ATP.

Turk and Ramanadham (2004) stated that the shorter iPLA2 isoforms that
lack the C-terminal catalytic domain function as negative modulators of
iPLA2-beta, the full-length isoform. They also noted that iPLA2-beta can
be proteolytically processed to yield truncated products that are
constitutively active. Turk and Ramanadham (2004) reviewed the role of
iPLA2 in phospholipid remodeling, signal transduction, cell
proliferation, and endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated apoptosis. They
stated that, in pancreatic islets, beta cells, and insulinoma cells,
iPLA2-beta participates in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, but it
is not involved in membrane phospholipid remodeling.

Arachidonic acid and its metabolites are involved in regulation of
endothelial cell proliferation. Herbert and Walker (2006) showed that
bromoenol lactone-mediated inhibition of iPLA2-VIA activity in human
endothelial cells blocked endothelial cell growth and inhibited DNA
synthesis in a dose-dependent manner. These effects were reversed upon
the exogenous addition of arachidonic acid. iPLA2-VIA activity was
required for expression of the cyclin A (see CCNA1; 604036)/CDK2
(116953) complex, and thus inhibition of iPLA2-VIA blocked S phase
progression and resulted in exit from the cell cycle. Inhibition of
iPLA2-VIA-mediated endothelial cell proliferation was sufficient to
block angiogenic tubule formation by human endothelial cells cocultured
with human dermal fibroblasts. Herbert and Walker (2006) concluded that,
by generating arachidonic acid, iPLA2-VIA regulates endothelial cell S
phase progression, cell cycle residence, and angiogenesis. They noted
that iPLA2-VIA is involved in cell growth and division in other cell
types through arachidonic acid-independent regulation of
glycerophospholipid metabolism during the cell cycle.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Neurodegeneration with Brain Iron Accumulation 2A and 2B
and Karak Syndrome

In studies of 12 families with infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (INAD,
NBIA2A; 256600) and a large consanguineous Pakistani family with
neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA2B; 610217), Morgan
et al. (2006) mapped a novel INAD locus to 22q12.3-q13.2 (lod score
4.78), with evidence of locus heterogeneity. They also detected linkage
to 22q12-q13 in a family with NBIA (lod score 4.65) suggesting allelism.
After sequencing 70 of the approximately 100 positional candidate genes,
they detected mutations in PLA2G6 in 4 kindreds, including the Pakistani
family with NBIA2B and 3 INAD probands (603604.0001-603604.0005). They
also identified PLA2G6 mutations in 28 additional probands with INAD and
in the original family with Karak syndrome and high basal ganglia iron
(see 610217). In all, they identified 44 unique mutations (32 missense,
5 deletions leading to frameshift, 3 nonsense, 2 leading to amino acid
deletions without frameshift, 1 splice site, and 1 large deletion). Of
the missense mutations, 85% occurred at amino acid positions that are
conserved in vertebrates.

In an independent study, Khateeb et al. (2006) identified a homozygous
mutation in PLA2G6 in 2 consanguineous Israeli Bedouin kindreds with
infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (NBIA2A). The 3-bp deletion
(603604.0004) resulted in the deletion of valine-691.

Gregory et al. (2008) found PLA2G6 mutations in 45 (79%) of 56 patients
with INAD1 (NBIA2A) and in 6 (20%) of 23 patients with idiopathic NBIA2B
(see, e.g., 603604.0006-603604.0008). No PLA2G6 mutations were found in
11 patients with clinical evidence of INAD, including 5 in whom
spheroids were reported on peripheral nerve biopsy. All 28 patients with
2 null mutations or homozygous for any mutation had early onset and
rapidly progressive disease. Patients with the less severe phenotype of
NBIA tended to have compound heterozygous missense mutations, consistent
with residual protein function.

- Parkinson Disease 14

In 2 unrelated families with adult-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (PARK14;
612953), Paisan-Ruiz et al. (2009) identified 2 different homozygous
mutations in the PLA2G6 gene (R741Q; 603604.0009 and R747W; 603604.0010,
respectively). The disorder was characterized by rapidly progressive
cognitive decline, bradykinesia, rigidity, and dystonia. None of the 3
affected patients had evidence of brain iron accumulation. The authors
emphasized that PLA2G6 mutations should be considered in patients with
neurodegeneration even without brain iron on MRI scan.

ANIMAL MODEL

Bao et al. (2004) obtained Ipla2-beta-null mice at a mendelian ratio.
They found that spermatozoa from Ipla2-beta -/- mice had reduced
motility and impaired ability to fertilize mouse oocytes in vitro and in
vivo. Female Ipla2-beta -/- mice had nearly normal fertility.

Ramanadham et al. (2008) found that Ipla2-beta-null mice had cortical
bone size, trabecular bone volume, bone mineralizing surfaces, and bone
strength similar to wildtype mice at 3 months of age. Both groups showed
declines in these measures with age, but the decline was more pronounced
in Ipla2-beta-null mice. The lower bone mass in Ipla2-beta-null mice was
accompanied by an increase in bone marrow fat. Relative to wildtype
mice, undifferentiated bone marrow stromal cells from knockout mice
expressed higher levels of Pparg (601487) and lower levels of Runx2
(600211) mRNA, and these changes correlated with increased adipogenesis
and decreased osteogenesis in bone marrow stromal cells in knockout
mice.

Malik et al. (2008) found that Pla2g6-null mice developed age-dependent
neurologic impairment that was evident in rotarod, balance, and climbing
tests by 13 months of age. Neuropathologic analysis showed numerous
spheroids in the brain similar to those observed in human INAD.
Spheroids contained tubulovesicular membranes and stained strongly with
anti-ubiquitin antibodies. Onset of motor impairment correlated with
increased spheroids throughout the neuropil in nearly all brain regions.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
NEURODEGENERATION WITH BRAIN IRON ACCUMULATION 2A
PLA2G6, TYR790TER

In a proband with classic infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (256600),
Morgan et al. (2006) identified a 2370T-G transversion in exon 17 of the
PLA2G6 gene that was predicted to result in a premature termination in
the protein (tyr790 to stop; Y790X). The parents were known to be
consanguineous and the mutation was present in homozygous state. The
presence of spheroids had been demonstrated.

.0002
NEURODEGENERATION WITH BRAIN IRON ACCUMULATION 2B
PLA2G6, LYS545THR

In a large consanguineous Pakistani family with neurodegeneration with
brain iron accumulation-2B (NBIA2B; 610217), Morgan et al. (2006)
identified homozygosity for a missense mutation in exon 12 of the PLA2G6
gene, a 1634A-C transversion that resulted in a lys545-to-thr
substitution (K545T).

.0003
NEURODEGENERATION WITH BRAIN IRON ACCUMULATION 2A
PLA2G6, VAL310GLU

In a case of classic infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (256600), Morgan et
al. (2006) described a 929T-A transversion in exon 7 of the PLA2G6 gene,
predicted to result in a val310-to-glu (V310E) amino acid change in the
protein. The mutation was present in homozygous state.

.0004
NEURODEGENERATION WITH BRAIN IRON ACCUMULATION 2A
PLA2G6, 2-BP DEL, 2070TGT

In a case of classic infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (256600), Morgan et
al. (2006) found a 3-bp deletion in exon 15 of the PLA2G6 gene,
2070_2072delTGT, resulting in deletion of val691 from the protein
(V691del). The mutation was present in homozygous state, or possibly
hemizygous state because of deletion of 1 allele.

In a consanguineous Bedouin kindred with cases of infantile neuroaxonal
dystrophy in 3 separate sibships and in another kindred with a single
affected individual, Khateeb et al. (2006) found the same 3-nucleotide
deletion. The mutation was also found in heterozygosity in a single
individual among 300 unrelated Bedouin controls. Both affected families
and the unrelated carrier had the same haplotype surrounding the
mutation.

.0005
KARAK SYNDROME
PLA2G6, ARG632TRP

In the original family with Karak syndrome (see 610217), Morgan et al.
(2006) detected homozygosity for a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 1894
in exon 14 of the PLA2G6 gene that resulted in a substitution of trp for
arg at codon 632 (R632W).

.0006
NEURODEGENERATION WITH BRAIN IRON ACCUMULATION 2A
PLA2G6, TYR790TER

In 4 patients with infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (256600), Gregory et
al. (2008) identified a homozygous 2370T-G transversion in the PLA2G6
gene, resulting in a tyr790-to-ter (Y790X) substitution. The INAD1
phenotype was characterized by early onset of psychomotor regression
with truncal hypotonia and rapid progression to tetraparesis.

Neurodegeneration with Brain Iron Accumulation 2A

In a patient with infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (256600), Gregory et
al. (2008) identified a homozygous 2-bp deletion (2370delTG) in the
PLA2G6 gene, which resulted in premature termination at codon 790
similar to the Y790X mutation (603604.0006).

Neurodegeneration with Brain Iron Accumulation 2B

In a patient with NBIA2B (610217), Gregory et al. (2008) identified
compound heterozygosity for the 2370delTG mutation and a 238G-A
transition, resulting in an ala80-to-thr (A80T; 603604.0007)
substitution. The patient presented at 3 years of age with toe walking
and lower extremity spasticity. She developed optic atrophy and became
nonambulatory by 5 years of age with dystonia and dysarthria,
progressing to profound sensorimotor impairment by age 9 years. She died
at age 23 years. Postmortem examination showed neuronal loss, axonal
swelling, and Lewy bodies and neurofibrillary tangles.

PARKINSON DISEASE 14
PLA2G6, ARG741GLN

In 2 affected first cousins from a large consanguineous Indian kindred
segregating adult-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (PARK14; 612953),
Paisan-Ruiz et al. (2009) identified a homozygous 2222G-A transition in
the PLA2G6 gene, resulting in an arg741-to-gln (R741Q) substitution in a
conserved residue. Both had onset at age 26 years of a rapidly
progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by rapid cognitive
decline, bradykinesia, tremor and imbalance, eventually leading to loss
of mobility. Although Paisan-Ruiz et al. (2009) noted that brain MRI
showed no evidence of brain iron accumulation, Gregory et al. (2009)
stated that this disorder could be considered under the umbrella
designation of atypical neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation
(NBIA).

.0010
PARKINSON DISEASE 14
PLA2G6, ARG747TRP

In a Pakistani man, born of consanguineous parents, with adult-onset
dystonia-parkinsonism (612953), Paisan-Ruiz et al. (2009) identified a
homozygous 2239C-T transition in the PLA2G6 gene, resulting in an
arg747-to-trp (R747W) substitution in a conserved region. The patient
had onset at age 18 years of rapid cognitive decline with personality
changes, foot dystonia, parkinsonism, and spasticity. Although
Paisan-Ruiz et al. (2009) noted that brain MRI showed no evidence of
brain iron accumulation, Gregory et al. (2009) stated that this disorder
could be considered under the umbrella designation of atypical
neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA).

.0011
PARKINSON DISEASE 14
PLA2G6, ARG635GLN

In 3 Japanese patients, including 2 sibs, with early-onset Parkinson
disease-14 (612953), Yoshino et al. (2010) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the PLA2G6 gene. All 3 patients
carried a 1904G-A transition, resulting in an arg635-to-gln (R635Q)
substitution in the catalytic domain. The 2 sibs also had a heterozygous
1354C-T transition, resulting in a gln452-to-ter (Q452X; 603604.0012)
substitution, and the third unrelated patient had a heterozygous 216C-A
transversion, resulting in a phe72-to-leu (F72L; 603604.0013)
substitution. Haplotype analysis suggested a founder effect for the
R635Q mutation. All 3 patients had onset before age 30 years of
L-dopa-responsive parkinsonism with varying degrees of cognitive decline
and frontotemporal lobar atrophy. Brain MRI of 1 patient showed iron
accumulation in the substantia nigra and striatum. None of the parents
with heterozygous mutations had signs of the disorder.

PLA2G6, 6.6-KB DEL

In a patient with infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (256600), Tonelli et
al. (2010) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
PLA2G6 gene: a 6.6-kb deletion from intron 4 to 6, resulting in an
in-frame deletion and removal of exons 5 and 6 and a large portion of
the ankyrin repeats motif, and a 109C-T transition in exon 2 resulting
in an arg37-to-ter (R37X; 603604.0015) substitution. Analysis of the
deletion junction in the first mutation showed that both breakpoints
occurred within AluY sequences, suggesting that the deletion was likely
mediated by nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR). The mutations
were predicted to result in an almost complete lack of enzyme activity,
although a gain of function could not be excluded. The patient had a
severe and rapidly progressive disease course, with onset before age 12
months, hypotonia, severe developmental delay with mental retardation,
and no eye contact. Spastic tetraparesis developed by age 18 months.
Skin biopsy showed axonal spheroids. Although brain iron accumulation
was not present, MRI at age 20 months showed hyperintensities on
T2-weighted imaging in the caudate and putamen, suggesting an early
degeneration process. Brain MRI at age 3 years showed cerebellar
cortical atrophy.

PARKINSON DISEASE 14
PLA2G6, ASP331TYR

In a Chinese man, born of consanguineous parents, with early-onset
Parkinson disease (612953), Shi et al. (2011) identified a homozygous
991G-T transversion in the PLA2G6 gene, resulting in an asp331-to-tyr
(D331Y) substitution. The mutation was not found in 300 control
individuals. The patient developed foot dragging and difficulty walking
at age 37 years. Symptoms progressed to include masked facies,
bradykinesia, and rigidity, but no atypical features. He had initial
good response to L-dopa treatment, but developed dyskinesias. Brain MRI
excluded iron deposition. PET scan showed significant reduction in DAT
binding in the basal ganglia. In vitro functional expression studies in
HEK293 cells showed that the mutant PLA2G6 protein had about 30%
residual activity. The patient's clinically unaffected 34-year-old
sister was also homozygous for the mutation, and PET scan showed some
loss of binding. The patient was identified in a cohort of 12 Chinese
families with early-onset parkinsonism who were screened for PLA2G6
mutations; none of the other 11 families carried a PLA2G6 mutation.

614016	TITLE *614016 DIACYLGLYCEROL LIPASE, BETA; DAGLB
;;DAGL-BETA;;
DGL-BETA;;
DGLB
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DAGLB is a diacylglycerol (DAG) lipase (EC 3.1.1.34) that catalyzes the
hydrolysis of DAG to 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol, the most abundant
endocannabinoid in tissues. In brain, DAGL activity is required for
axonal growth during development and for retrograde synaptic signaling
at mature synapses (summary by Bisogno et al., 2003).

CLONING

By searching the human genome for sequences similar to Penicilium Dagl,
Bisogno et al. (2003) identified DAGLA (614015) and DAGLB. The deduced
full-length 672-amino acid DAGLB protein contains 4 transmembrane
domains near its N terminus, followed by a serine lipase motif, a
lipase-3 motif, and a C-terminal tail. The N terminus and catalytic
domain were predicted to reside inside the cell. Mouse and human DAGLB
share 79% amino acid identity. Dagla and Daglb were coexpressed in
axonal tracts of embryonic mouse at embryonic day 10, but were absent
from axonal tracts in adult mouse brain. In adult cerebellum, Dagla and
Daglb expression was restricted to deep cerebellar nuclei and synaptic
fields, including Purkinje cell dendrites.

GENE FUNCTION

Using sn-1-steroyl-2-arachidonoyl-glycerol as substrate, Bisogno et al.
(2003) showed that the membrane fraction of COS cells transfected with
mouse Daglb showed optimal activity at pH 7. Daglb showed a 3- to 8-fold
selectivity for the sn-1 over the sn-2 position of DAGs, and it appeared
to prefer sn-1-oleoyl-2 acyl-glycerols with linoleic acid more than
oleic, arachidonic, or stearic acids in the 2 position. Daglb was
sensitive to ser/cys-hydrolase inhibitors and to a drug that blocked
2-arachidonoyl-glycerol synthesis. Glutathione and calcium stimulated
Daglb activity.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the DAGLB gene to chromosome 7p22.1 based on an
alignment of the DAGLB sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF450090) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

ANIMAL MODEL

Tanimura et al. (2010) found that Dglb -/- mice were viable and appeared
normal. Histologic examination revealed no brain abnormalities, and
synaptic transmission, kinetics, and currents were no different from
wildtype. Endocannabinoid-mediated retrograde synaptic suppression was
intact in Dglb -/- brain.

CONNEXIN 32; CX32;;
LIVER CONNEXIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Connexins are membrane-spanning proteins that assemble to form gap
junction channels that facilitate the transfer of ions and small
molecules between cells (Bergoffen et al., 1993). For a general
discussion of connexin proteins, see GJB2 (121011).

CLONING

Kumar and Gilula (1986) isolated the human CX32 gene from a human liver
cDNA library. By Northern blot analysis, Bergoffen et al. (1993) showed
CX32 expression in liver and peripheral nerve.

Sohl et al. (2003) stated that mouse and human CX32 share 99% amino acid
identity and differ at only 4 residues. They also share significant
similarity in the 5-prime UTR and promoter region. Northern blot
analysis detected a 1.6-kb CX32 transcript in both mouse and human. In
both species, expression was highest in liver and moderate in pancreas,
kidney, and brain. No expression was detected in skeletal muscle, lung,
and heart.

MAPPING

Willecke et al. (1990) used a rat cDNA probe in Southern analysis of a
panel of human-mouse somatic cell hybrids to map CX32 to Xp11-q13.
Through analysis of somatic cell hybrids by PCR and hybridization,
Fishman et al. (1991) assigned the GJA1 gene (121014) to chromosome 6
and the GJB1 gene to Xp11-q22. Structural comparisons of these genes
indicated that they probably arose from a common progenitor gene.
Because of a critical function, the connexins may have evolved early and
have remained relatively conserved despite their disparate locations.

Using a series of somatic cell hybrid mapping panels and a rat GJB1
probe, Corcos et al. (1992) mapped the CX32 gene to proximal Xq13.1, in
interval 8, as described by Lafreniere et al. (1991). By somatic cell
hybrids, Hsieh et al. (1991) mapped GJB1 to Xcen-q22 and mapped the
corresponding gene to the X chromosome in the mouse. Raimondi et al.
(1992) refined the assignment to Xq13 by in situ hybridization.

GENE FUNCTION

Bergoffen et al. (1993) found CX32 expression in myelinated peripheral
nerve at the nodes of Ranvier and Schmidt-Lanterman incisures. CX32 may
form intracellular gap junctions that connect to the folds of Schwann
cell cytoplasm, allowing the transfer of nutrients, ions, and molecules
to the innermost myelin layers.

Scherer et al. (1995) demonstrated that CX32 is normally found in the
paranodal myelin loops and Schmidt-Lanterman incisures of myelinating
Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system, as well as in
oligodendrocytes and their processes, but not in compact myelin of the
central nervous system.

Kumar and Gilula (1996) gave a general review of the gap junction
communication channel. Beta-1 connexin is widely expressed in many
tissues, including liver.

Bondurand et al. (2001) showed that the transcription modulator SOX10
(602229), in synergy with EGR2 (129010), strongly activates CX32
expression in vitro by directly binding to its promoter. In agreement
with this finding, SOX10 and EGR2 mutants identified in patients with
peripheral myelin defects failed to transactivate the CX32 promoter.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By direct sequencing, Bergoffen et al. (1993) identified 7 different
mutations in the CX32 gene (see, e.g., 304040.0001-304040.0003) in
affected persons from 8 families with X-linked dominant
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTX1; 302800).

Bone et al. (1995) described sequence analysis from 19 unrelated
patients with X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, detecting 6 novel
mutations and 3 previously reported mutations (see, e.g.,
304040.0003-304040.0011). Analysis of the distribution of these
mutations as well as those previously reported suggested to the authors
that virtually all regions of connexin 32 are important in its function.

Ionasescu et al. (1996) studied 27 families with X-linked
Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy. Mutations in the coding region of the
CX32 gene were found in 22 families. These mutations included 4 nonsense
mutations, 8 missense mutations, 2 medium-sized deletions, and 1
insertion. Most missense mutations showed a mild clinical phenotype (5
of 8), whereas all nonsense mutations, the larger of the 2 deletions,
and the insertion that produced frameshifts showed severe phenotypes. No
point mutations in the CX32 gene coding region were found in 5 CMTX1
families with mild clinical phenotype. In 3 of these families, positive
genetic linkage with the markers of the Xq13.1 region were found; the
genetic linkage of the remaining 2 families could not be evaluated
because of their small size.

Omori et al. (1996) studied 4 known mutations in the connexin-32 gene:
lys60 to phe, a mutation in a highly conserved cysteine residue; val139
to met (304040.0003), located in the transmembrane region; arg215 to
trp, located in the cytoplasmic tail; and ala220 to ter (304040.0005),
also located in the cytoplasmic tail. Since HeLa cells do not show
detectable levels of gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) or
expression of any connexins, they tested the functional effects of
transfecting mutant genes in HeLa cultures. The first 3 mutations were
unable to restore GJIC in transfected HeLa cells (although their gene
products were detectable), in contrast to normal GJIC detected with the
last mutation. In addition, the dominant-negative effect was tested in
doubly transfected HeLa cells and the investigators found that low
expression of the mutant CX32 gene had a relatively significant effect
on diminishing GJIC. Omori et al. (1996) therefore concluded that
certain mutants form nonfunctional chimeric connexins with wildtype
connexins.

Nelis et al. (1997) described 5 new mutations in the CX32 gene. Janssen
et al. (1997) performed SSCP analysis of the CX32 gene in 121 patients
selected from the larger group of 443 patients on the basis of linkage
to Xq13.1, absence of the 17p12 duplication or deletion, and absence of
point mutations in PMP22 and P0. They found 5 new mutations and 3
mutations previously described in other unrelated families.

In 35 unrelated CMTX patients without the 17p11.2 duplication but with
median nerve conduction between 30 and 40 m/s, Rouger et al. (1997)
screened for a CX32 mutation. A total of 14 mutations were found, 5 of
which had not previously been reported. All but 1 of the mutations were
detected by SSCP. Mutations causing CMTX have been found mostly in exon
2 of the gene.

Latour et al. (1997) identified a total of 19 separate mutations in the
CX32 gene as the cause of CMTX in 21 French families.

Ainsworth et al. (1998) reported a family in which affected members with
CMTX had complete deletion of the GJB1 gene with complete absence of the
Cx32 gene product. The clinical phenotype in the affected individuals in
this kindred did not appear to differ greatly from the phenotype
observed in other individuals with missense, nonsense, or frameshift
mutations in the gene. This would appear to make a dominant-negative
effect of the mutation unlikely.

Ikegami et al. (1998) stated that more than 130 different mutations of
the GJB1 gene, including coding and noncoding regions, had been reported
in patients with X-linked CMT. In studies of 49 Japanese families with
CMT1 they found 5 mutations of the GJB1 gene; 4 of which had not
previously been reported.

Nelis et al. (1999) identified 163 distinct mutations in the coding
region of the CX32 gene in 268 unrelated patients with hereditary
peripheral neuropathy. Of these mutations, 125 were missense mutations,
1 a double missense mutation, 1 a missense mutation combined with a
1-amino acid deletion, 12 nonsense mutations, 17 frameshift mutations,
and 6 in-frame deletions and insertions. Further, in 1 case a complex
rearrangement in the coding region of CX32 was found. Most missense
mutations showed a mild clinical phenotype, whereas all nonsense
mutations and frameshift deletion/insertions showed severe phenotypes.
Forty-four percent of the codons were mutated in more than 1 patient. At
codon 22, 4 distinct mutations were identified in 20 unrelated patients.
In 2 X-linked families not showing mutations in the coding region of
CX32, mutations in the noncoding region were identified by Ionasescu et
al. (1996). In addition to the 163 mutations tabulated for the CX32 gene
in patients with hereditary peripheral neuropathy, Nelis et al. (1999)
identified 58 mutations in the MPZ gene (159440) and 27 mutations in the
PMP22 gene (601097).

GJB1 is expressed in both the peripheral and the central nervous system.
In consequence, it is not surprising that patients with CMTX1 and
specific GJB1 mutations have both peripheral neuropathy and a mild or
transient brain disorder (Paulson et al., 2002; Hanemann et al., 2003;
Takashima et al., 2003).

Kleopa et al. (2006) reported 2 novel mutations in the GJB1 gene that
segregated with CMTX1 in 2 unrelated families. In vitro expression
studies and immunohistochemistry showed that the mutant proteins were
retained within the Golgi apparatus and failed to reach the cell
membrane where gap junctions are normally formed.

Casasnovas et al. (2006) identified 34 GJB1 mutations, including 6 novel
mutations, in 59 patients from 34 CMT families of Spanish or Portuguese
descent. The extracellular loop domains were affected in 64.6% of
mutations.

resulting in a substitution of leucine for valine.

.0010
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, X-LINKED DOMINANT, 1
GJB1, 1-BP DEL

In a family with X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (302800), Bone et
al. (1995) found a deletion of thymidine residue in codon 137 of CX32,
resulting in a frameshift mutation which predicted a truncated 194-amino
acid protein with the last 58 amino acids starting at codon 137 altered
from wildtype.

.0011
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, X-LINKED DOMINANT, 1
GJB1, VAL95MET

In a family with X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (302800), Bone et
al. (1995) found a G-to-A transition in codon 95 of the CX32 gene,
resulting in the substitution of methionine for valine.

Montenegro et al. (2011) reported the use of exome sequencing to
identify the V95M mutation in affected members of a large family with
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and a questionable inheritance pattern.
Affected individuals had classic features of the disease, with onset
between ages 14 and 40 years of distal sensory impairment and muscle
weakness and atrophy affecting the upper and lower limbs. Nerve
conduction velocities were in the intermediate range.

.0012
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, X-LINKED DOMINANT, 1
GJB1, ASN205SER

Since CX32 is expressed not only in Schwann cells in the peripheral
nervous system but also in oligodendrocytes in the central nervous
system, Bahr et al. (1999) examined a CMTX1 (302800) family for evidence
of CNS involvement. The family had an asn205-to-ser mutation involving
the fourth transmembrane domain of CX32. The patients showed typical
clinical and electrophysiologic abnormalities in the peripheral nervous
system, but, in addition, visual, acoustic, and motor pathways of the
CNS were affected subclinically. This was indicated by pathologic
changes in visual evoked potentials, brainstem auditory evoked
potentials, and central motor evoked potentials. They suggested that
abnormal electrophysiologic findings in CNS pathway examinations should
raise the suspicion of CMTX and a search for mutations in the GJB1 gene.

.0013
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, X-LINKED DOMINANT, 1
GJB1, 367G-T

In a 71-year-old woman with X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease
(302800), Tabaraud et al. (1999) identified a truncating mutation, GAG
to TAG at nucleotide 367, in the GJB1 gene. The mutation led to
termination by a glutamic acid in codon position 102 instead of codon
283 for the normal protein.

.0014
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, X-LINKED DOMINANT, 1
GJB1, SER85CYS

Janssen et al. (1997) identified a C-to-G transversion in the GJB1 gene,
resulting in a ser85-to-cys (S85C) substitution, associated with
X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (302800).

Abrams et al. (2002) showed that expression of the S85C mutation
resulted in large, relatively nonselective, voltage-dependent currents
not seen in oocytes expressing wildtype Cx32. The findings suggested
that the S85C mutant has a much greater propensity to form conducting
hemichannels than does wildtype Cx32. The authors suggested that the
resulting increase in membrane permeability may prevent normal
functioning of the Schwann cells and peripheral nerves of patients
harboring this mutation.

.0015
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, X-LINKED DOMINANT, 1
GJB1, -528T-G

Ionasescu et al. (1996) described a family with X-linked CMT (302800)
that harbored a T-to-G transversion at position -528 with respect to the
ATG start codon. Bondurand et al. (2001) used gelshift experiments to
show that the mutation impaired the binding of SOX10 (602229) to the
CX32 promoter region.

.0016
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, X-LINKED DOMINANT, 1
GJB1, THR55ILE

In 2 sibs with X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (302800), Panas et
al. (2001) identified a C-to-T transition at position 164 in exon 2 of
the GJB1 gene, resulting in a thr55-to-ile (T55I) substitution. In
addition to extremity weakness and atrophy and polyneuropathy, the
patients had episodes of severe weakness lasting from hours to days,
dysarthria, dysphagia, and bilateral hyperintensities of the
periventricular white matter on MRI. Panas et al. (2001) noted that
connexin-32 is expressed in Schwann cells, oligodendrocytes, and some
neuronal populations, which may explain the CNS involvement.

.0017
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, X-LINKED DOMINANT, 1
GJB1, 21-BP DUP

In a patient with X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (302800),
Kawakami et al. (2002) identified a 21-bp duplication from residues 55
to 61 in exon 2 of the GJB1 gene, resulting in a 7-amino acid insertion
in the first extracellular loop of the protein. The patient showed
clinical cerebellar abnormalities with a normal MRI and prolonged
central somatosensory conduction times. His clinically asymptomatic
mother carried the mutation. The authors referred to the report by Panas
et al. (2001) (see 304040.0016), and suggested that mutation in this
area of the GJB1 gene, specifically residue 55, may lead to CNS
manifestations.

.0018
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, X-LINKED DOMINANT, 1
GJB1, 3-BP DEL, 304GAG

Hanemann et al. (2003) reported a family in which 3 members were
affected with X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (302800). Direct
sequencing of the GJB1 gene in 2 living patients identified a 3-bp
deletion (304delGAG), resulting in deletion of a glutamic acid at codon
102 (glu102). In addition to classic CMT clinical findings, all 3
patients had transient CNS symptoms correlating with transient and
reversible white matter lesions on MRI. CNS symptoms included
paraparesis, monoparesis, tetraparesis, dysarthria, aphasia, and cranial
nerve palsies.

.0019
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, X-LINKED DOMINANT, 1
GJB1, -526G-C

In affected members of a large family with X-linked CMT (302800),
Houlden et al. (2004) identified a -526G-C transversion in a highly
conserved region of the nerve-specific P2 promoter of the GJB1 gene. The
mutation occurs within a SOX10 (602229) S2 binding site, similar to the
-528T-G mutation (304040.0015). Functional expression studies showed
that the -526G-C mutation impaired SOX10 binding, resulting in a 65%
decrease in transcriptional activation.

.0020
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, X-LINKED DOMINANT, 1
GJB1, PHE235CYS

In a girl with a severe early-onset form of X-linked CMT (302800), Liang
et al. (2005) identified a 766T-G transversion in the GJB1 gene,
resulting in a phe235-to-cys (F235C) substitution in the carboxy tail
domain of the protein. The mutation was not identified in 50 control
chromosomes. The patient's asymptomatic mother also carried the
mutation, but Southern blot analysis showed preferential inactivation of
the mutant X-chromosome by a ratio of approximately 9 to 1. Functional
expression studies demonstrated that cells with the F235C mutant protein
had normal plasma membrane expression of the channel protein, but showed
a reduction of the resting membrane potential of more than 40 mV, with a
decrease in the threshold of activation. Cells expressing the mutant
protein also showed decreased viability compared to wildtype. Liang et
al. (2005) concluded that the propensity of the F235C hemichannels to be
open at resting membrane potential ('leaky channel') adversely affected
cell viability, thus resulting in a severe phenotype. Similar in vitro
findings had been reported for another GJB1 mutation (S85C;
304040.0014).

.0021
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, X-LINKED DOMINANT, 1
DEJERINE-SOTTAS NEUROPATHY, INCLUDED
GJB1, VAL136ALA

In Korean patients with X-linked CMT (302800), Choi et al. (2004)
identified a 407T-C transition in the GJB1 gene, resulting in a
val136-to-ala (V136A) substitution. (In the original publication, Choi
et al. (2004) erroneously designated the nucleotide change as 408T-C.)

In a Korean girl with Dejerine-Sottas syndrome (145900), Chung et al.
(2005) identified 2 mutations in 2 different genes: the V136A
substitution in the GJB1 gene and an R359W mutation in the EGR2 gene
(129010.0004). She inherited the EGR2 mutation from her father, who had
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease-1D (607678). The GJB1 gene was de novo. The
father had pes cavus and developed difficulty walking at age 8 years,
but had a milder phenotype than the daughter, who had experienced gait
difficulties since infancy and facial weakness. She also had bilateral
hand muscle weakness and atrophy and had sensory impairment of both
upper and lower extremities. Chung et al. (2005) concluded that the more
severe phenotype in the daughter was caused by an additive effect of the
2 mutations.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Human synovial sarcomas contain a recurrent and specific chromosomal
translocation t(X;18)(p11.2;q11.2). By screening a synovial sarcoma cDNA
library with a YAC spanning the X chromosome breakpoint, Clark et al.
(1994) identified a hybrid transcript that contained 5-prime sequences
mapping to chromosome 18 and 3-prime sequences mapping to the X
chromosome (see SSX1; 312820). The chromosome 18 gene was symbolized SYT
by Clark et al. (1994). Sequencing of cDNA clones showed that the normal
SYT gene encodes a protein rich in glutamine, proline, and glycine.

The SYT protein appears to act as a transcriptional coactivator and the
SSX proteins as corepressors. Thaete et al. (1999) found that the SYT
protein contains a novel 54-amino acid domain at its N terminus (the SNH
domain) that is conserved in proteins from a wide variety of species.
SYT also has a C-terminal domain, designated the QPGY domain because it
is rich in glutamine, proline, glycine, and tyrosine, that contains the
transcriptional activator sequences.

The mouse homolog of SS18 was isolated and sequenced in full by de
Bruijn et al. (1996), who referred to the gene as Syt. It was found to
have been conserved during evolution and to be part of a region of
synteny between human and mouse chromosomes 18. In early embryogenesis,
mouse Syt is ubiquitously expressed. In later stages, the expression
becomes confined to cartilage tissues, specific neuronal cells, and some
epithelium-derived tissues. In mature testis, expression was
specifically observed in primary spermatocytes.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence and BAC analyses, de Bruijn et al. (2001) determined
that the SS18 gene contains 11 exons spanning approximately 70 kb. The
promoter region lacks CAAT and TATA boxes but contains CpG islands,
suggesting that SS18 is a housekeeping gene.

MAPPING

The SS18 gene maps to chromosome 18p11.2 (Clark et al., 1994). De Bruijn
et al. (1996) found that the SS18 gene is part of a region of synteny
between human and mouse chromosomes 18.

GENE FUNCTION

Brett et al. (1997) showed that human fluorescence-tagged SYT localized
to discrete nuclear structures in several different transfected cell
lines. The speckled pattern did not colocalize with PML
(102578)-containing bodies or spliceosomes. The SYT-SSX2 (300192) fusion
protein also localized to nuclear speckles, and it retained the
transcriptional activating properties of SYT in reporter gene assays.
Brett et al. (1997) concluded that the addition of the C-terminal SSX
domain to SYT provides a new interacting domain that redirects the SYT
activation domain to different target promoters.

Thaete et al. (1999) found that deletion of the SNH domain of SYT
resulted in a more active transcriptional activator, suggesting that
this domain acts as an inhibitor of the activation domain. The
C-terminal SSX domain present in the SYT-SSX translocation protein
contributes a transcriptional repressor domain to the protein. Thus, the
fusion protein has transcriptional activating and repressing domains.
Thaete et al. (1999) demonstrated that the human homolog of the
SNF2/Brahma protein BRM (SMARCA2; 600014) colocalized with SYT and
SYT-SSX in nuclear speckles, and also interacted with SYT and SYT-SSX
proteins in vitro. They suggested that this interaction may provide an
explanation of how the SYT protein activates gene transcription.

Perani et al. (2005) found that the C-terminal YQ domain and the last 84
amino acids adjacent to the YQ domain of COAA (RBM14; 612409)
specifically bound to the QPGY domain of SYT. COAA also bound to the
SYT-SSX2 fusion protein. SYT acted together with COAA to stimulate
estrogen receptor (see 133430)- and glucocorticoid receptor (GCCR;
138040)-dependent transcriptional activation. Activation was hormone
dependent and required functional BRM and/or BRG1 (SMARCA4; 603254).

CYTOGENETICS

Human synovial sarcomas contain a recurrent and specific chromosomal
translocation t(X;18)(p11.2;q11.2). By screening a synovial sarcoma cDNA
library with a YAC spanning the X chromosome breakpoint, Clark et al.
(1994) identified a hybrid transcript containing 5-prime sequences
mapping to chromosome 18 and 3-prime sequences mapping to the X
chromosome (see SSX1; 312820). A probe from the chromosome 18 gene, SYT,
detected genomic rearrangements in 10 of 13 synovial sarcomas.
Sequencing of cDNA clones showed that rearrangement of the SYT gene
resulted in formation of a fusion protein.

Crew et al. (1995) demonstrated that the t(X;18)(p11.2;q11.2) found in
human synovial sarcoma results in the fusion of the chromosome 18 SS18
gene to either of 2 distinct genes, SSX1 or SSX2 (300192), at Xp11.2.
The SSX1 and SSX2 genes encode closely related proteins (81% identity)
of 188 amino acids that are rich in charged amino acids. The N-terminal
portion of each SSX protein exhibits homology to the Kruppel-associated
box (KRAB), a transcriptional repressor domain previously found only in
Kruppel-type zinc finger proteins, e.g., zinc finger protein-117
(ZNF117; 194624) and ZNF83 (194558). PCR analysis demonstrated the
presence of SYT-SSX1 or SYT-SSX2 fusion transcripts in 29 of 32 synovial
sarcomas examined, indicating that the detection of these hybrid
transcripts by PCR may represent a useful diagnostic method. Sequence
analysis demonstrated further heterogeneity in the fusion transcripts
with the formation of 2 distinct SYT-SSX1 fusion junctions and 2
distinct SYT-SSX2 fusion junctions. Both the SYT-SSX1 and the SYT-SSX2
hybrid transcripts encode fusion proteins in which the C-terminal 8
amino acids of the normal SYT protein have been replaced by 78 amino
acids encoded by an SSX gene. The SSX1 and SSX2 protein sequences
present in these 2 fusion products have 66 of 78 amino acids in common.

Gure et al. (1997) identified 5 variants of the SSX gene, SSX1, SSX2,
SSX3 (300325), SSX4 (300326), and SSX5 (300327), but only SSX1 and SSX2
had been shown to fuse with the SYT gene in the translocation t(X;18) in
synovial sarcoma. Skytting et al. (1999) analyzed the type of SYT-SSX
fusion mRNA in biopsy specimens from 3 synovial sarcomas by nested
RT-PCR amplification. Two of the tumors were positive with either the
SSX1 or the SSX2 primers, and 1 was positive with both RT-PCR assays.
The third specimen showed an 187-bp fragment with 100% homology to the
SYT gene linked to a 246-bp fragment with 100% homology to the long
splice variant of SSX4. The breakpoint on SSX4 was identical to that
observed for SSX1 and SSX2; all of the SSX genes involved in the SYT-SSX
fusion genes are split between the fourth and fifth exons. Since Kawai
et al. (1998) found a difference in prognosis of the 2 fusion gene
variants SYT-SSX1 and SYT-SSX2 in synovial sarcoma, Skytting et al.
(1999) suggested that the basepair differences between the SSX
transcripts may have biologic significance. They speculated that these
deviations may be localized to exon 5. In all 3 SYT-SSX fusion variants,
this domain contained several sites for phosphorylation. In SSX4, there
are 5 such residues (3 serines and 2 threonines); in SSX1 and SSX2,
there are 5 and 6 residues, respectively. Only 2 of these potential
phosphorylation sites are common for the 3 variants.

Yang et al. (2002) demonstrated that SYT-SSX1 and SYT-SSX2 coexisted in
12 of 121 (10%) SYT-SSX positive primary tumors. Characterization at the
RNA,DNA, and chromosomal level showed that in all 12 cases the SYT-SSX1
and SYT-SSX2 fusions resulted in identical SYT-SSX fusion transcripts.
However, at the genomic level, the translocations were different, and
most likely occurred between variable intronic sites in the target
genes. By interphase FISH analyses of 10 cases, Yang et al. (2002)
identified SYT-SSX2 translocations as the most abundant in all but 1, in
which SYT-SSX1 was predominating.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Hsu et al. (1994) identified and characterized the ALDH6 gene. The
existence of this unique ALDH isozyme in human saliva and its
polymorphism had previously been demonstrated. The ALDH6 cDNA is 3,457
bp long and contains an open reading frame encoding 512 amino acids. The
deduced amino acid sequence shows that the protein is larger than human
liver ALDH1 (100640) by 11 residues at the N terminus, and the degree of
identity between the 2 isozymes is 70% with an alignment of 500 amino
acid residues. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the ALDH6 gene
is expressed at low levels in many tissues and at higher levels in
salivary gland, stomach, and kidney.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hsu et al. (1994) determined that the ALDH6 gene spans about 37 kb and
contains 13 exons. Putative TATA and CCAAT boxes and Sp1 binding sites
were found in the 5-prime upstream region of the gene.

MAPPING

Hsu et al. (1994) mapped the ALDH6 gene to chromosome 15q26 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

GENE FUNCTION

By in situ hybridization of chick and mouse embryos, Grun et al. (2000)
demonstrated expression of Aldh1a3 in the developing sensory
neuroepithelia of the eye, nose, and ear, and in discrete sites within
the central nervous system. Expression of chick Aldh1a3 in a human
choriocarcinoma cell line conferred increased sensitivity to retinol in
a retinoic acid receptor (see 180240)-dependent reporter assay.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected individuals from 3 unrelated consanguineous families with
bilateral severe microphthalmia (MCOP8: 615113), Fares-Taie et al.
(2013) identified homozygous mutations in the ALDH1A3 gene
(600463.0001-600463.0003).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MICROPHTHALMIA, ISOLATED 8
ALDH1A3, ARG89CYS

In 3 affected individuals from a large, multiply consanguineous
Pakistani family with bilateral severe microphthalmia (MCOP8; 615113),
Fares-Taie et al. (2013) identified homozygosity for a 265C-T transition
in the ALDH1A3 gene, resulting in an arg89-to-cys (R89C) substitution at
a conserved residue. The mutation segregated with disease in the family
and was not found in 200 control chromosomes, SNP databases, or the
Exome Variant Server. Transfection studies in HEK293 cells showed no
significant difference in expression between the R89C mutant and
wildtype ALDH1A3, although immunoblot analysis showed that the mutant
protein was strongly reduced compared to wildtype, suggesting that the
R89C mutant might be unstable and subject to degradation. In addition to
their eye findings, the proband and her cousin were diagnosed with
autism and 'possible autism,' respectively, and the cousin also had
pulmonary stenosis and an atrial septal defect; Fares-Taie et al. (2013)
suggested that these features might not be related to the mutation in
ALDH1A3.

ALDH1A3, ALA493PRO

In an affected girl from a consanguineous Turkish family with bilateral
severe microphthalmia (MCOP8; 615113), Fares-Taie et al. (2013)
identified homozygosity for a 1477G-C transversion in the ALDH1A3 gene,
resulting in an ala493-to-pro (A493P) substitution at a conserved
residue. The mutation segregated with disease in the family and was not
found in 200 control chromosomes, SNP databases, or the Exome Variant
Server. Transfection studies in HEK293 cells showed no significant
difference in expression between the A493P mutant and wildtype ALDH1A3,
although immunoblot analysis showed that the mutant protein was strongly
reduced compared to wildtype, suggesting that the A493P mutant might be
unstable and subject to degradation.

ALDH1A3, IVSDS, G-T, +1

In an affected girl from a consanguineous Moroccan family with bilateral
severe microphthalmia (MCOP8; 615113), Fares-Taie et al. (2013)
identified homozygosity for a 475+1G-T splice site transversion in the
ALDH1A3 gene, predicted to abolish a splice donor site and cause
in-frame skipping of exon 5. Her unaffected parents and an unaffected
brother were heterozygous for the mutation.

612222	TITLE *612222 GALACTOSAMINE-6-SULFATE SULFATASE; GALNS
;;N-ACETYLGALACTOSAMINE-SULFATE SULFATASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The GALNS gene encodes N-acetylgalactosamine-sulfate sulfatase (EC
3.1.6.4), a lysosomal enzyme involved in the catabolism of keratan and
chondroitin sulfate.

CLONING

Gibson et al. (1987) purified and characterized the GALNS enzyme.

Tomatsu et al. (1991) cloned and sequenced a full-length cDNA of human
placental N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase. The deduced
522-residue protein is composed of a 26-amino acid N-terminal signal
peptide and a mature polypeptide of 496 amino acid residues, including 2
potential asparagine-linked glycosylation sites. Expression of the cDNA
in transfected deficient fibroblasts resulted in higher production of
the sulfatase activity compared to untransfected cells. The amino acid
sequence showed a high degree of homology with those of other
sulfatases, including human arylsulfatases A (607574), B (611542), and C
(300747), glucosamine-6-sulfatase (607664), and iduronate-2-sulfatase
(300823).

GENE STRUCTURE

Nakashima et al. (1994) determined that the human GALNS gene contains 14
exons and spans approximately 50 kb. By deletion analysis, they found
the region -98 to -1 upstream of the ATG codon to be a minimal promoter.

Morris et al. (1994) found that the GALNS gene contains 14 exons and
spans approximately 40 kb. The potential promoter for GALNS lacks a TATA
box but contains GC box consensus sequences, consistent with its role as
a housekeeping gene. The GALNS gene contains an Alu repeat in intron 5
and a VNTR-like sequence in intron 6.

MAPPING

Tomatsu et al. (1992) demonstrated that the GALNS gene is located on
chromosome 16q24 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Baker et al.
(1993), also using fluorescence in situ hybridization, mapped the gene
to 16q24.3. The authors also confirmed the localization to this band by
PCR analysis of the somatic cell hybrid panel used for fine mapping of
chromosome 16.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type IVA (253000), also known as
Morquio syndrome A, Tomatsu et al. (1992) identified 4 different
mutations in the GALNS gene (612222.0001-612222.0004).

In 5 unrelated Japanese patients with MPS IVA, Hori et al. (1995) found,
in heteroallelic state, 2 separate deletions of nearly 8.0 and 6.0 kb in
the GALNS gene. There were Alu repetitive elements near the breakpoints
of the 8.0-kb deletion; this deletion had clearly resulted from an
Alu-Alu recombination. The 6.0-kb deletion involved illegitimate
recombinational events between incomplete short direct repeats of 8 bp
at the deletion breakpoints. This was the first documentation of a
frequently occurring double deletion in a gene that is not a member of a
gene cluster. One of the patients was homozygous for the double
deletion, and the others were heterozygous. In the 4 who were
heterozygous, Tomatsu et al. (1996) identified novel mutations in the
GALNS gene on the other allele: 1 nonsense and 3 missense.

Wang et al. (2010) identified 27 GALNS mutations, including 16 novel
mutations, among 24 Chinese patients with MPS IVA. Approximately 63% of
the mutations found among the Chinese patients were not observed in
other countries, suggesting that a different mutational spectrum may
exist in the Chinese population. The most common mutation G340D
(612222.0018) was present in 8 (16.7%) of 48 mutant alleles and was
found only in 5 patients from central eastern China. Haplotype analysis
indicated a founder effect.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Sukegawa et al. (2000) studied 15 missense mutations and 2 newly
engineered active site mutations (C79S, C79T) in the GALNS gene by
transient expression analysis. Mutant proteins, except for C79S and
C79T, were destabilized and detected as insoluble precursor forms, while
the C79S and C79T mutants were of a soluble mature size. Mutations
identified in patients with the severe phenotype had no activity,
whereas mutations identified in patients with the mild phenotype had a
considerable residual activity (1.3-13.3% of wildtype GALNS activity).
Sukegawa et al. (2000) also constructed a tertiary structural model of
human GALNS from the x-ray crystal structure of homologous sulfatases
and investigated 32 missense mutations. The authors proposed 3 different
biochemical models for the severe phenotype: (i) destruction of the
hydrophobic core or modification of the packing; (ii) removal of a salt
bridge to destabilize the entire conformation; (iii) modification of the
active site. In contrast, mild mutations were mostly located on the
surface of the GALNS protein.

ANIMAL MODEL

Tomatsu et al. (2003) generated transgenic mice homozygous for a
disruption in exon 2 of the Galns gene. These mice had no detectable
GALNS enzyme activity, showed increased urinary glycosaminoglycan
levels, and accumulated glycosaminoglycans in multiple tissues including
liver, kidney, spleen, heart, brain, and bone marrow. At 2 months old,
lysosomal storage was present primarily within reticuloendothelial
cells. By 12 months old, vacuolar change was observed in glomeruli and
heart valves. In the brain, hippocampal and neocortical neurons and
meningeal cells had lysosomal storage, and keratan sulfate and
chondroitin-6-sulfate were more abundant in corneal epithelial cells of
Galns -/- mice. Surprisingly, radiographs revealed no change in the
skeletal bones of mice up to 12 months old.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE IVA
GALNS, ASN204LYS

In 2 brothers with a mild form of Morquio syndrome A (253000), Fukuda et
al. (1992) and Tomatsu et al. (1992) identified a homozygous 667C-G
transversion in the GALNS gene, resulting in an asn204-to-lys (N204K)
substitution. Both unaffected parents were heterozygous for the
mutation. Transient expression of the mutant allele in GALNS-deficient
fibroblasts showed markedly decreased enzyme activity.

.0002
MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE IVA
GALNS, ALA138VAL

In a patient with a severe form of Morquio syndrome A (253000), Tomatsu
et al. (1992) identified a homozygous 468T-C transition in the GALNS
gene, resulting in an ala138-to-val (A138V) substitution.

.0003
MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE IVA
GALNS, ARG386CYS

In a patient with severe Morquio syndrome A (253000), Tomatsu et al.
(1992) identified a 386C-T transition in the GALNS gene, resulting in an
arg386-to-cys (R386C) substitution. A PCR method was used for complete
cDNA sequencing.

In a study of 20 MPS IVA patients from Latin America, including 16 with
a severe phenotype and 4 with an attenuated phenotype, Tomatsu et al.
(2004) identified 12 different mutations in the GALNS gene, 9 of which
were previously unreported. The R386C mutation accounted for 32.5% of
the unrelated mutant alleles. It was identified in all the Latin
American populations studied and was associated with a severe form of
the disorder. MPS IVA patients had increased urine and plasma keratan
sulfate concentrations compared to normal controls. Keratan sulfate
concentrations were higher in patients with a severe phenotype than in
those with the attenuated form of the disorder.

.0004
MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE IVA
GALNS, 2-BP DEL, 1343CA

In a Japanese patient, born of consanguineous parents, with a severe
form of Morquio syndrome A (253000), Fukuda et al. (1992) and Tomatsu et
al. (1992) identified a homozygous 2-bp deletion in the GALNS gene
(1343delCA). Fukuda et al. (1992) referred to the mutation as 1342delCA.
This mutation was revealed by TaqI restriction analysis of a cDNA
fragment amplified by the polymerase chain reaction.

.0005
MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE IVA
GALNS, ILE113PHE

In Caucasian patients with Morquio syndrome A (253000), Tomatsu et al.
(1995) identified a 393A-T transversion in the GALNS gene, resulting in
an ile113-to-phe (I113F) substitution. Allele-specific oligonucleotide
(ASO) or SSCP analysis indicated that this mutation accounted for 9
(22.5%) of 40 unrelated mutant chromosomes from 23 Caucasian patients,
including 6 consanguineous cases. It was not found among 20 Japanese
patients. In addition to this common mutation, 10 different point
mutations and 2 small deletions were detected.

Among 23 Australian or Irish patients with Morquio syndrome A and
various clinical phenotypes, Yamada et al. (1998) found that the I113F
mutation was associated with a severe phenotype. The relative frequency
of the I113F mutation in Australia corresponded to that observed in
Northern Ireland, suggesting that both mutations were probably
introduced to Australia by Irish migrants during the 19th century.
Haplotype analysis provided additional data that the I113F mutation
originated from a common ancestor.

.0006
MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE IVA
GALNS, GLN473TER

In a patient with severe Morquio disease (253000), Tomatsu et al. (1995)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in exon 13 of the
GALNS gene: a C-to-T transition resulting in a gln473-to-ter (Q473X)
substitution, and an A-to-G transition resulting in an asn487-to-ser
substitution (N487S; 612222.0007).

MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE IVA
GALNS, ARG94GLY

In 2 Polish sibs with Morquio syndrome (253000), Bunge et al. (1997)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the GALNS gene: an
arg94-to-gly (R94G) substitution inherited from the father and an
arg259-to-gln (R259Q; 612222.0009) substitution inherited from the
mother. The sibs were diagnosed at 5 and 6 years of age, respectively.
At ages 13 and 14, they were still considered to be mildly affected,
with mild thoracolumbar kyphosis, slight prominence of the sternum,
hypermobility of ligaments, hip hypoplasia in the boy only, no corneal
clouding, and normal height. Their mother, who was homozygous for the
R259Q mutation, was found to have greatly reduced enzymatic activity,
but only limited manifestations of MPS IVA: short trunk with slight
prominence of sternum, and hoarse voice. She had no corneal clouding and
was 1.60 m tall.

.0009
MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE IVA
GALNS, ARG259GLN

See 612222.0008 and Bunge et al. (1997).

Tylki-Szymanska et al. (1998) described a 2-generation Morquio A
(253000) family with 2 distinct clinical phenotypes. The 2 probands from
the second generation showed intermediate signs of the disease, whereas
their affected mother, aunt, and 2 uncles had only very mild symptoms.
Galactose-6-sulfatase activity in leukocytes and fibroblasts of the
affected family members was clearly deficient. Molecular genetic
analysis of the GALNS gene showed that 2 different point mutations
segregated in the family and correlated well with the clinical
phenotype. The probands with intermediate severity of symptoms were
compound heterozygous for the R94G mutation (612222.0008), which was
inherited from the unaffected father, and for R259Q. The mother and her
affected sibs with the unusually mild phenotype were homozygous for the
R259Q mutation.

MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE IVA
GALNS, GLY301CYS

Kato et al. (1997) identified 3 novel missense mutations in 16 of 19
Colombian Morquio syndrome A unrelated alleles (84.2%). A gly301-to-cys
(G301C) mutation and a S162F (612222.0011) mutation accounted for 68.4%
and 10.5% of mutations, respectively, whereas the third mutation, F69V,
(612222.0012), was limited to a single allele. The skewed prevalence of
G301C in Colombian patients and haplotype analysis by restriction
fragment length polymorphisms in the GALNS gene suggested that G301C
originated from a common ancestor. Investigation of a genetic background
by means of mtDNA lineages indicated that all of the Colombian patients
were probably of Native American descent.

MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE IVA
GALNS, THR312SER

Studies of patients from the British-Irish population have shown that
the I113F (612222.0005) mutation in the GALNS gene is the most common
single mutation among Morquio syndrome A patients and produces a severe
clinical phenotype. Yamada et al. (1998) studied mutations in the GALNS
gene from 23 additional patients (15 from Australia, 8 from Northern
Ireland) with various clinical phenotypes (severe, 16 cases;
intermediate, 4 cases; mild, 3 cases). They found 2 common mutations
that together accounted for 32% of the 44 unrelated alleles in these
patients. One was a thr312-to-ser (T312S) substitution, found
exclusively in milder patients, and the other was I113F, which produced
a severe phenotype. Relatively high residual GALNS activity seen when
the T312S mutant cDNA was overexpressed in mutant cells provided an
explanation for the mild phenotype in patients with this mutation. The
disruption and relative frequency of the I113F and T312S mutations in
Australia corresponded to those observed in Northern Ireland and were
unique to these 2 populations, suggesting that both mutations were
probably introduced to Australia by Irish migrants during the 19th
century. Haplotype analysis provided additional data that the I113F
mutation originated from a common ancestor. The other 9 novel mutations
identified in these 23 patients were each limited to a single family.

.0014
MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE IVA
GALNS, ASP60ASN

Montano et al. (2003) described the clinical phenotype of 5 patients
from 3 unrelated Finnish families with Morquio A disease and
characterized the disease-causing mutations in GALNS. In all 3 families
the affected individuals were compound heterozygous for an asp60-to-asn
(D60N) mutation and a second mutation: A291T (612222.0015) and W230X
(612222.0016) in 2 of the families, and 1374delT (612222.0017) causing
premature termination in a third. W230X and A291T had no residual GALNS
activity when overexpressed in cultured cells, whereas D60N had 12.2%
residual activity compared with wildtype. The tertiary structural model
of the GALNS protein showed that asp60 is located on the surface of the
molecule, away from the active site. On the other hand, ala291 and
trp230 are localized near the active site. The molecular characteristics
of the D60N mutation explained the attenuated clinical phenotype of the
patients. The oldest patient was 9 years of age, and the youngest 3
years.

In 5 of 24 Chinese patients with MPS IVA (253000), Wang et al. (2010)
identified a 1019G-A transition in exon 10 of the GALNS gene, resulting
in a gly340-to-asp (G340D) substitution. Three patients were homozygous,
and 2 patients were compound heterozygous for G340D and another
mutation. G340D was the most common mutant allele, accounting for 16.7%
of the total number of mutant alleles. Haplotype analysis indicated a
founder effect, and all 5 patients were residents of or emigrants from
central eastern China.

609959	TITLE *609959 MYELOID-ASSOCIATED DIFFERENTIATION MARKER; MYADM
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using differential display analysis, Pettersson et al. (2000) identified
mouse myeloid-associated differentiation marker (Myadm) based upon its
varied expression during differentiation of an Il3 (147740)-dependent
myeloid progenitor cell line established from mouse bone marrow. The
deduced protein contains 8 potential transmembrane domains and several
potential phosphorylation sites. Northern blot analysis on hematopoietic
cell lines revealed restricted expression of Myadm to cells belonging to
the myeloid lineage. Expression was also seen in mature granulocytes and
macrophages. Tissue analysis showed high expression of Myadm in lung and
more moderate expression in bone marrow and brain. RT-PCR experiments
demonstrated expression of Myadm in multipotent cells
(c-kit+Sca-1+Lin-), erythroid progenitors, and early lymphoid
progenitors.

By database searching with mouse Myadm as query, Cui et al. (2002)
identified human MYADM and cloned a full-length MYADM sequence from a
human bone marrow cDNA library. The deduced 298-amino acid protein has a
predicted molecular mass of 32 kD. It contains 7 predicted transmembrane
domains and shows sequence homology with the T-cell differentiation
protein MAL (188860) and plasmolipin (PLMP; 600340). MYADM shares 75.8%
overall sequence identity with mouse Myadm, with highest levels of
conservation seen in the predicted transmembrane regions. Northern blot
analysis detected 3.3- and 2.2-kb MYADM transcripts. Expression of the
longer transcript was seen in all tissues tested except thymus;
expression of the shorter transcript was seen in heart, placenta, lung,
pancreas, testis, and peripheral blood leukocytes and was undetectable
in all other tissues. Semiquantitative PCR assays showed that expression
of MYADM was not only significantly higher in peripheral blood
leukocytes than in bone marrow cells, but was also upregulated in NB4
cells (derived from a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia) that
were treated with the differentiation inducer all-trans retinoic acid
(ATRA).

GENE FUNCTION

Using antisense Myadm oligonucleotides, Pettersson et al. (2000) showed
that downregulation of mouse Myadm expression in pluripotent
hematopoietic progenitor cells inhibited colony formation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Cui et al. (2002) determined that the MYADM gene contains 3 exons and
spans 7.1 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Cui et al. (2002) mapped the MYADM gene to
chromosome 19q13.33-q13.4.

;;THYROID HORMONE RECEPTOR-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 4; THRAP4;;
THYROID HORMONE RECEPTOR-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN, 100-KD; TRAP100;;
KIAA0130
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Nuclear hormone receptors regulate transcription in part by recruiting
distinct transcription coregulatory complexes to target gene promoters.
The thyroid hormone receptor-associated proteins (TRAPs) form a complex
with the thyroid hormone receptor (TR) (see THRA, 190120) and markedly
enhance TR-mediated transcription in vitro.

CLONING

Nagase et al. (1995) cloned TRAP100, which they designated KIAA0130,
from a myeloid cell line. TRAP100 encodes a deduced 989-amino acid
protein that contains a P-loop predicted to be an ATP/GTP-binding site.
Northern blot analysis revealed ubiquitous expression in all tissues
examined.

Yuan et al. (1998) immunopurified TRAP100 within TR/TRAP protein
complexes from thyroid hormone (T3)-treated HeLa cells. Peptide
sequencing followed by database searching indicated identity with the
protein encoded by KIAA0130. TRAP100 has a calculated molecular mass of
110 kD and contains a presumptive zinc finger in the N terminus, a
putative ATP/GTP-binding site in the central region, and 6 dispersed
LXXLL motifs, suggesting nuclear hormone receptor interaction. Northern
blot analysis revealed ubiquitous expression with relative abundance in
skeletal muscle, heart, and placenta.

Zhang and Fondell (1999) identified mouse Trap100 by screening a mouse
EST database with human sequences. The mouse protein shares 91% sequence
identity with human TRAP100, but lacks 50 amino acids in the N terminus
and contains 7 LXXLL motifs. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues
revealed abundant expression in testis, heart, and brain, and relatively
low expression in spleen, lung, and skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

By gel filtration of TR/TRAP complexes in the absence of T3 ligand, Yuan
et al. (1998) determined that the association of TRAP100 within the
complex was not dependent on ligand binding. In contrast to the in vitro
results obtained with TRAP220 (604311), they found no direct binding
between TRAP100 and the thyroid receptor. TRAP100 also showed only
marginal interaction with the estrogen receptor (see ESR1 133430),
retinoid X receptor-alpha (RXRA; 180245), PPAR-alpha (PPARA; 170998),
and PPAR-gamma (PPARG; 601487). Zhang and Fondell (1999) noted that
although mouse Trap100 contains 7 LXXLL repeats, it fails to interact
directly with TR and other nuclear hormone receptors in vitro. Instead,
they found that Trap100 interacts and coprecipitates with Trap220, which
directly binds TR, and the vitamin D receptor (VDR; 601769) in a
ligand-dependent manner. They found that transient overexpression of
Trap100 in mammalian cells further enhanced ligand-dependent
transcription by both TR and VDR, suggesting a functional role for
Trap100 in nuclear hormone receptor-mediated transactivation.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the MED24
gene to chromosome 17 (TMAP stSG38317).

605485	TITLE *605485 VACUOLAR PROTEIN SORTING 41, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF; VPS41
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Ferrous transport (Fet) proteins are involved in the uptake and
processing of iron in yeast. By analysis of Fet mutants, Radisky et al.
(1997) identified yeast Vps41 as a gene required for assembly and
targeting of the high-affinity iron transport system. By searching an
EST database and screening a human heart cDNA library, they obtained a
cDNA encoding human VPS41. The deduced 854-amino acid protein contains a
C-terminal sequence highly conserved among the VPS41 homologs and also
found in clathrin heavy chain (118955). The non-yeast VPS41 homologs
also have a RING-H2 motif. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.5-kb
transcript equally expressed in all tissues tested.

MAPPING

Radisky et al. (1997) stated that the EST corresponding to VPS41 maps to
chromosome 14q23. However, Hartz (2009) mapped the VPS41 gene to
chromosome 7p14.1 based on an alignment of the VPS41 sequence (GenBank
GENBANK AK026848) with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

610037	TITLE *610037 VACUOLAR PROTEIN SORTING 37, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF, B; VPS37B
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching a database for sequences homologous to yeast Vps37,
Stuchell et al. (2004) identified human VPS37B. The deduced 285-amino
acid protein has an N-terminal mod(r) (modifier of rudimentary) domain
that contains 2 coiled-coil motifs.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Stuchell et al. (2004) showed that VPS37B
bound TSG101 (601387), which functions in vacuolar protein sorting.
TSG101 bound to several different sites on VPS37B, including a putative
coiled-coil region and a PTAP motif. In transfected human embryonic
kidney cells, TSG101 and VPS28 (601387) coimmunoprecipitated with
VPS37B, and the 3 proteins comigrated in a size-exclusion gel as a
350-kD complex, the size expected for ESCRT-I (endosomal sorting complex
required for transport I). Like TSG101, VPS37B became trapped on
aberrant endosomal compartments in the presence of mutant VPS4A (609982)
lacking ATPase activity. VPS37B could recruit TSG101/ESCRT-I activity
and thereby rescue budding of mutant human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV)-1 Gag proteins or HIV-1 viruses lacking native late domains.
Stuchell et al. (2004) concluded that VPS37B is a component of the human
ESCRT-I complex required for HIV-1 budding and infectivity.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the VPS37B
gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP RH98647).

300840	TITLE *300840 PRA1 DOMAIN FAMILY, MEMBER 2; PRAF2
;;JM4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PRAF2 belongs to the prenylated RAB acceptor-1 (PRA1, or RABAC1; 604925)
domain family (PRAF). Members of this family have 4 transmembrane
domains, hydrophilic N and C termini, and a PRA1 domain. PRAF proteins
are involved in multiple cellular processes, including endo- and
exocytic vesicle trafficking and glutamate uptake (summary by Borsics et
al., 2010).

CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a B-cell cDNA library with the C
terminus of CCR5 (601373) as bait, followed by database analysis,
Schweneker et al. (2005) identified PRAF2, which they called JM4
(Jena-Muenchen-4). The predicted 178-amino acid protein contains 4
transmembrane-spanning domains and is evolutionarily conserved. It
shares 42% amino acid identity, as well as structural similarity, with
JWA (ARL6IP5; 605709). Northern blot analysis revealed near ubiquitous
expression of a 1.2-kb transcript in human tissues. Cell fractionation
and Western blot analysis showed association of JM4 with cellular
membranes in transfected canine thymocytes. Confocal microscopy
demonstrated colocalization of JM4 with JWA, as well as with calnexin
(CANX; 114217), an endoplasmic reticulum marker, and M6PR (154540), a
trans-Golgi network and endosome marker, in granular structures of
transfected HeLa and COS cells.

Fo et al. (2006) determined that the human PRAF2 protein contains an
N-terminal amphiphysin (AMPH; 600418) SH3 domain, 4 transmembrane
domains, intracellular N and C termini, and 2 putative phosphorylation
sites. Western blot analysis showed that PRAF2 was expressed as a 19-kD
protein, consistent with its calculated molecular mass, in all human
tissues examined except testis. Strongest expression was detected in
brain, small intestine, lung, spleen, and pancreas. Possible dimer
formation and/or posttranslational modifications were observed in
several tissues.

By immunohistochemical analysis, Koomoa et al. (2008) found strong PRAF2
expression in Purkinje cells in human cerebellum, with more moderate
expression in cells of the molecular and granular levels. Expression in
human cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and lateral ventricles was
restricted to neuronal cells. Immunoblot analysis showed expression of
Praf2 in synaptic vesicles of rat brain.

GENE FUNCTION

By coimmunoprecipitation analysis of transfected HEK293 cells,
Schweneker et al. (2005) confirmed that JM4 interacted with CCR5. JM4
formed dimers and trimers with itself and heteromultimers with human and
rat JWA in transfected cells. Schweneker et al. (2005) concluded that
JM4 is a CCR5-interacting protein that may function in trafficking and
membrane localization of CCR5 and other receptors.

Using immunohistochemical analysis, Fo et al. (2006) showed that PRAF2
was overexpressed in human breast, colon, lung, and ovary cancer tissues
compared with corresponding normal tissues.

Using microarray analysis, Geerts et al. (2007) detected PRAF2 mRNA in
most tumor types examined, with highest expression in pediatric
neuroblastic tumors (see 256700). In neuroblastoma patients, PRAF2
expression correlated with higher patient age (greater than 1 year),
poorer patient survival, higher stage tumors, and MYCN (164840)
amplification. Immunofluorescence microscopy of neuroblastoma cells
demonstrated localization of PRAF2 in cytoplasmic punctae, with weaker
expression in nuclei and perinuclear regions. Treatment of neuroblastoma
cells with cerulenin, a fungal metabolite, further increased PRAF2
expression, followed by loss of spindle-like morphology and the onset of
rounding and apoptosis. Geerts et al. (2007) concluded that increased
expression of PRAF2, which is associated with clinical features
predicting unfavorable disease outcome, is a candidate prognostic marker
in neuroblastoma.

Using microarray and immunoblot analyses and immunofluorescence
microscopy, Borsics et al. (2010) demonstrated elevated expression of
PRAF2 mRNA and protein in multiple cancer types, with highest expression
in malignant glioma. Subcellular expression was high in small,
cytoplasmic vesicle-like structures, as well as in and around nuclei, of
a malignant glioma cell line. Monomeric 19-kD PRAF2 was associated with
nuclear fractions and nuclear and cytoplasmic membranes, whereas 37-kD
dimeric forms of PRAF2 were found in cytosol. Knockdown of PRAF2 reduced
the viability of the glioblastoma cell line and inhibited migration and
invasion.

GENE STRUCTURE

Fo et al. (2006) determined that the PRAF2 gene contains 3 exons and
spans about 2.8 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Fo et al. (2006) mapped the PRAF2 gene to
chromosome Xp11.23.

613095	TITLE #613095 POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE 2; PKD2
;;POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE, ADULT, TYPE II; APKD2
DESCRIPTION A number sign (#) is used with this entry because polycystic kidney
disease-2 is caused by heterozygous mutation in the gene encoding
polycystin-2 (PKD2; 173910) on chromosome 4q.

For a phenotypic description and discussion of genetic heterogeneity of
polycystic kidney disease, see 173900.

CLINICAL FEATURES

A form of adult polycystic kidney disease that is inherited as an
autosomal dominant and is seemingly phenotypically identical to the
chromosome 16-linked PKD1 (601313) has been observed in several
kindreds. Kimberling et al. (1988) described a 5-generation kindred,
descendants of Sicilian immigrants to the United States, in which
autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease occurred without linkage to
the alpha-hemoglobin complex. The frequency of recombination exceeded
24%. Clinical findings in this family were indistinguishable from those
in other families with the linked disease. Kumar et al. (1990) presented
linkage studies in the large family reported by Kimberling et al.
(1988), which excluded the locus from about 61% of chromosome 1,
including segments of the long and short arms. Romeo et al. (1988)
described another Italian family with autosomal dominant polycystic
kidney disease unlinked to the alpha-hemoglobin complex. On the basis of
linkage studies, Pieke et al. (1989) concluded that all except 2 of 69
families had a posterior likelihood greater than 90% for linkage with
16p markers.

In a study of 24 families with adult-onset polycystic kidney disease,
Elles et al. (1990) found 2 families with unusual features consistent
with a form unlinked to PKD1. Bachner et al. (1990) described a large
3-generation family with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease of
clinically unusual form and no linkage to markers on the short arm of
chromosome 16. Ultrasonographic screening of 60 family members
identified 20 individuals, whose ages ranged from 10 to 80 years, with
one or several cysts in only one kidney and 7 individuals with cysts in
both kidneys. Others have pointed out that cysts may be unilateral in
the early stages of ordinary polycystic kidney disease.

Coto et al. (1992) found that 1 of 13 large Spanish families with
autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease did not show segregation
with chromosome 16p markers.

Bear et al. (1992) reported that in Newfoundland families in which the
polycystic kidney disease did not cosegregate with chromosome 16
markers, the age of onset of end-stage renal disease was later (68.7
years) than in persons with chromosome 16-related disease (56.3 years).
Ravine et al. (1992) analyzed 18 families (285 affected members) with
mutations at the PKD1 locus and 5 families (49 affected persons) in
which involvement at this locus was dismissed. Non-PKD1 patients lived
longer than PKD1 patients (median survival, 71.5 vs 56.0 years,
respectively), had a lower risk of progressing to renal failure, were
less likely to have hypertension, were diagnosed at an older age, and
had fewer renal cysts at the time of diagnosis. Although most of the
PKD1 families were ascertained through clinics treating patients with
renal impairment, no non-PKD1 family was identified through this source.
Ravine et al. (1992) suggested that, partly because of the milder
phenotype of APKD unlinked to chromosome 16, the reported prevalence of
this genotype is probably an underestimate. Jeffery et al. (1993) also
found milder progression of the disease ('less aggressive phenotype') in
a Sicilian family with the form unlinked to chromosome 16.

In 8 Spanish families with APKD, San Millan et al. (1995) confirmed
earlier findings of a milder phenotype with PKD2. While the mean age of
onset of end-stage renal disease was 54.2 +/- 8.1 years for PKD1, it was
66.2 +/- 3.3 years for PKD2.

Coto et al. (1995) studied 17 large Spanish families with adult dominant
polycystic kidney disease, 5 of which showed linkage to chromosome 4q
(PKD2). They found that renal cysts developed at an earlier age in PKD1
mutation carriers, and end-stage renal failure occurred at an older age
in people affected with PKD2.

Hateboer et al. (1999) reported the results of a multicenter study of
333 persons with PKD1 (in 31 families), 291 persons with PKD2 (in 31
families), and 398 geographically matched controls. Median age at death
or onset of end-stage renal disease was 53.0 years, 69.1 years, and 68.0
years for PKD1, PKD2, and controls, respectively. Women with PKD2 had a
significantly longer median survival than men: 71.0 years versus 67.3
years, but no sex influence was apparent in PKD1. Age at presentation
with kidney failure was later in PKD2 than in PKD1 (median age 74.0 vs.
54.3 years). PKD2 patients were less likely to have hypertension, a
history of urinary tract infection, or hematuria.

Deltas (2001) reviewed mutations in the PKD2 gene causing polycystic
kidney disease. He repeated the observation that patients with PKD2
mutations run a milder course compared to PKD1 carriers, with an average
10 to 20 years later age of onset and lower probability to reach
end-stage renal failure.

Bergmann et al. (2008) reported a 4-generation family carrying a
mutation in the PKD2 gene (173910.0009) with previously undetected
disease, in which 2 fourth-generation sibs died in the perinatal period.
The mother's first pregnancy resulted in a healthy girl; the second was
complicated by oligohydramnios and massively enlarged hyperechogenic
fetal kidneys, and the male infant born at 30 weeks' gestation died
shortly after birth from respiratory failure. The third pregnancy was
complicated from 20 weeks' gestation forward, and the infant girl born
at 34 weeks' gestation also died shortly after birth; renal biopsy
showed glomerulocystic kidney disease. Abdominal ultrasound examination
revealed no cysts in the mother, but the father had 2 cortical cysts in
the left kidney and 3 cysts in the right kidney, and the paternal
grandmother and great-grandmother both had bilateral renal cysts. None
of the adults had any clinical symptoms.

Bataille et al. (2011) reported 3 unrelated probands with PKD2 and
laterality defects, including situs inversus and dextrocardia; other
members of these families with PKD2 did not have laterality defects. The
findings suggested that laterality defects may occur in some patients
with PKD2 mutations, as has been demonstrated in animal models (see,
e.g., Pennekamp et al., 2002). Bataille et al. (2011) suggested that
laterality defects may represent a qualitative difference between the
PKD1 and PKD2 phenotypes.

OTHER FEATURES

Khonsari et al. (2013) found that mice with conditional deletion of the
Pkd2 gene in neural crest-derived cells showed many signs of mechanical
trauma to craniofacial structures, such as fractured molar roots,
distorted incisors, alveolar bone loss, and compressed temporomandibular
joints, as well as abnormal skull shapes. The phenotype was not apparent
during embryonic stages, suggesting that postnatal mechanical stress is
important for the development of these structures. Three-dimensional
photographic analysis of the craniofacial features of 19 human PKD2
patients showed some specific characteristics, including increased
facial asymmetry, vertical lengthening of the face and nose, and mild
mid-facial hypoplasia. The results suggested that the PKD2 gene plays a
role in craniofacial growth as a mechanoreceptor, and that patients with
PKD2 mutations may have subtle craniofacial features.

INHERITANCE

APKD2 is inherited in a autosomal dominant manner. Losekoot et al.
(2012) reported an unusual case in which a male infant presented with
neonatal onset of severe polycystic kidney disease. Molecular analysis
showed that he was homozygous for a PKD2 missense variant
(leu656-to-trp; L656W) resulting from maternal uniparental disomy. He
presented at birth with a distended abdomen, and renal biopsy showed
polycystic kidney disease. Renal function was abnormal in the first week
of life, but improved. He did not have proteinuria or hematuria at age
13 years and was treated for hypertension. Serial ultrasounds showed
that he continued to develop renal cysts, as well as cysts in the
prostate and epididymis. At age 18 years, he had no symptoms except for
occasional flank pain. Liver imaging and function were normal. Each
parent was unaffected and there was no family history of renal disease,
even though the mother carried the variant.

MAPPING

Kimberling et al. (1993) independently mapped the second autosomal
dominant polycystic kidney disease gene to 4q in a 9-cM segment flanked
by D4S231 and D4S414. The kindred was a large one previously described
by Kumar et al. (1990, 1991). The original ancestors immigrated to
America from Sicily and members of the kindred had been cared for in
Colorado for 20 years. Lod scores with the 2 flanking markers were 5.98
and 10.12, respectively, for a recombination fraction of 0.05.

On the basis of linkage findings in a large Danish kindred with the
'unlinked' form of APKD, Norby and Schwartz (1990) suggested that the
locus might be on chromosome 2. With the marker D2S44 on 2q, a maximum
lod score of 2.12 was obtained at theta = 0.10. Peters et al. (1993)
later showed that the disorder in this Danish kindred was linked to 4q.

In Iceland, Fossdal et al. (1993) found that 3 of 7 families were
'unlinked' to 16p13.3 and that in one of the 'unlinked' families, the
disease locus was excluded from a part of the long arm of chromosome 2.
Other evidence suggested conclusively that the gene for the 'unlinked'
form of the disease is located on chromosome 4. Using highly polymorphic
microsatellite DNA markers, Peters et al. (1993) found linkage with
markers D4S231 and D4S423, giving a multipoint lod score of 22.42. The 2
markers are located on 4q. It was suggested that the gene in this case
is located in the region 4q21-q23. Peters et al. (1993) stated that
roughly 86% of affected European families have their renal disorder on
the basis of a mutation on 16p.

By linkage analysis in 19 families with autosomal recessive polycystic
kidney disease (263200), Zerres et al. (1994) demonstrated that the gene
for that disorder is not at the PKD2 locus.

In 8 Spanish families with APKD unlinked to 16p13.3, San Millan et al.
(1995) determined that the gene was closely linked to the marker D4S423;
maximum lod score = 9.03 at theta = 0.00. Multipoint linkage analysis,
as well as a study of recombinant haplotypes, placed the PKD2 locus
between D4S1542 and D4S1563, which defines a genetic interval of
approximately 1 cM.

Also in Spain, Coto et al. (1995) arrived at similar conclusions. They
studied 17 large families with adult dominant polycystic kidney disease
using ultrasonography and DNA microsatellite markers in 17 large
families. Five of the 17 families showed negative linkage for 16p13.3
markers; in these families, significant linkage to 4q was observed. No
evidence of another locus was found.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Mochizuki et al. (1996) reported the isolation and characterization of a
candidate gene for PKD2 on chromosome 4. They analyzed the PKD2 gene in
affected individuals in 3 families with PKD2. Three nonsense mutations
in the PKD2 gene were identified in affected individuals; see
173910.0001, 173910.0002, and 173910.0003. These mutations were not
present in controls.

Viribay et al. (1997) used heteroduplex and SSCP analyses in a
systematic mutation screening of all 15 exons of the PKD2 gene in
chromosome 4-linked ADPKD families, They identified and characterized 7
novel mutations, with a detection rate of approximately 90% in the
populations studied. All of the mutations resulted in the premature stop
of translation (e.g., 173910.0005). All the mutations were unique and
were distributed throughout the gene without evidence of clustering.
Comparison of specific mutations with a clinical profile in these
families showed no clear correlation.

Veldhuisen et al. (1997) systematically screened the PKD2 gene for
mutations by SSCP analysis in 35 families with ADPKD and identified 20
mutations.

Pei et al. (1998) screened for PKD2 mutations in 11 Canadian families
with ADPKD. In 4 families, linkage to PKD2 had been documented; in the
remaining 7 smaller families, one or more affected members had
late-onset end-stage renal disease at age 70 or older, a feature
suggesting PKD2. Pei et al. (1998) found mutations in 8 of the 11
families, with no difference in the detection rate between the
PKD2-linked families and the families with late-onset ESRD. In 3
unrelated families, insertion or deletion of an adenosine in a
polyadenosine tract, (A)8 at nucleotides 2152-2159, was found in exon
11, suggesting that this mononucleotide repeat tract is prone to
mutations from 'slipped strand mispairing.' All the mutations, scattered
between exons 1 and 11, were predicted to result in a truncated
polycystin-2 that lacks both the calcium-binding EF-hand domain and the
2 cytoplasmic domains required for the interaction of polycystin-2 with
polycystin-1 and with itself. Furthermore, no correlation was found
between the location of the mutations in the PKD2 coding sequence and
disease severity.

In both kidneys of a patient with PKD2, Koptides et al. (1999)
identified, for the first time, multiple novel somatic mutations within
the PKD2 gene of epithelial cells. The family involved in this case had
previously been shown to possess a 1-bp insertion (173910.0004) as the
germline mutation. In 7 (33%) of 21 cysts examined, the authors
identified a different 1-bp insertion (173910.0007) within the inherited
wildtype allele. In 2 other cysts, a nonsense mutation and a splice site
deletion had occurred in a PKD2 allele that could not be identified as
the inherited wildtype or mutant. Koptides et al. (1999) suggested that
the autosomal dominant form of PKD2 occurs by a cellular recessive
mechanism, supporting a 2-hit model for cyst formation.

Koptides et al. (2000) provided the first direct genetic evidence that
polycystins 1 and 2 interact, perhaps as part of a larger complex. In
cystic DNA from a kidney of a patient with autosomal dominant PKD1, the
authors showed somatic mutations not only in the PKD1 gene of certain
cysts, but also in the PKD2 gene of others, generating a
transheterozygous state with mutations in both genes. The mutation in
PKD1 was of germinal nature and the mutation in PKD2 was of somatic
nature. The authors stated that to their knowledge there was no
precedent to the transheterozygous model as a mechanism for human
disease development.

Watnick et al. (2000) found somatic mutations of PKD2 in 71% of ADPKD2
cysts analyzed. They found clonal somatic mutations of PKD1 in a subset
of cysts that lacked PKD2 mutations. In 10 cysts, they demonstrated that
the wildtype PKD2 allele had acquired the mutation. They found 3 PKD2
cysts with somatic PKD1 mutations in each cyst; comprehensive screening
of the entire PKD2 coding sequence was negative. They referred to this
as a pathogenic effect of transheterozygous mutations.

Torra et al. (1999) sought to demonstrate that somatic mutations are
present in renal cysts from a PKD2 kidney. They studied 30 renal cysts
from a patient with PKD2 in whom the germline mutation was shown to be a
deletion that encompassed most of the gene. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH)
studies showed loss of a wildtype allele in 10% of cysts. Screening of 6
exons of the gene by SSCP detected 8 different somatic mutations, all of
which were expected to produce truncated proteins. Overall, more than
37% of the cysts studied represented somatic mutations. No LOH for the
PKD1 gene or locus D3S1478 on chromosome 3 was observed in those cysts,
which demonstrated that somatic alterations were specific.

Pei et al. (2001) reported studies of an extensively affected
Newfoundland family in which it appeared that there was bilineal disease
from independently segregating PKD1 and PKD2 mutations. A PKD2 mutation
(2152delA; L736X) was found in 12 affected pedigree members. In
addition, when the disease status of these individuals was coded as
unknown in linkage analysis, they found, with markers at the PKD1 locus,
significant lod scores, i.e., greater than 3.0. The findings strongly
supported the presence of a PKD1 mutation in 15 other affected pedigree
members, who lacked the PKD2 mutation. Two additional affected
individuals had transheterozygous mutations involving both genes, and
they had renal disease that was more severe than that in affected
individuals who had either mutation alone. This was said to be the first
demonstration of bilineal disease in ADPKD. In humans, transheterozygous
mutations involving both PKD1 and PKD2 are not necessarily embryonically
lethal. The authors concluded that the presence of bilineal disease as a
confounder needs to be considered in the search for the PKD3 locus.

In affected members of 2 unrelated families with polycystic kidney
disease, Bataille et al. (2011) identified 2 different heterozygous
mutations in the PKD2 gene (173910.0010 and 173910.0011, respectively).
In addition to kidney disease, the proband from each of the families
also showed laterality defects, including situs inversus and
dextrocardia, that were not seen in other affected family members. A
third proband with PKD2 and a large 80-kb deletion involving PKD2 and
ABCG2 (603756) also had laterality defects. The findings suggested that
laterality defects may occur in some patients with PKD2 mutations, as
has been demonstrated in animal models (see, e.g., Pennekamp et al.,
2002).

ANIMAL MODEL

Wu et al. (1998) introduced a mutant exon 1 in tandem with the wildtype
exon 1 at the mouse Pkd2 locus. This was an unstable allele that
underwent somatic inactivation by intragenic homologous recombination to
produce a true null Pkd2 allele. Mice heterozygous and homozygous for
this mutation develop polycystic kidney and liver lesions that are
indistinguishable from the human phenotype. In all cases, renal cysts
arise from renal tubular cells that lose the capacity to produce Pkd2
protein. Wu et al. (1998) concluded that somatic loss of Pkd2 expression
is both necessary and sufficient for renal cyst formation in ADPKD,
suggesting that PKD2 occurs by a cellular recessive mechanism.

Wu et al. (2000) induced 2 mutations in the mouse homolog Pkd2: an
unstable allele that can undergo homologous recombination-based somatic
rearrangement to form a null allele; and a true null allele. They
examined these mutations to understand the function of polycystin-2 and
to provide evidence that kidney and liver cyst formation associated with
Pkd2 deficiency occurs by a 2-hit mechanism. They found that Pkd2 -/-
mice die in utero between embryonic day (E) 13.5 and parturition. They
have structural defects in cardiac septation and cyst formation in
maturing nephrons and pancreatic ducts. Pancreatic ductal cysts also
occur in adult Pkd2 mice heterozygous for the unstable allele,
suggesting that this clinical manifestation of ADPKD also occurs by a
2-hit mechanism. As in human ADPKD, formation of kidney cysts in adult
mice heterozygous for the unstable allele is associated with renal
failure and early death (median survival, 65 weeks vs 94 weeks for
controls). Adult mice heterozygous for the null mutation have
intermediate survival despite absence of cystic disease or renal
failure, providing the first indication of a deleterious effect of
haploinsufficiency at Pkd2 on long-term survival.

610619	TITLE *610619 COAGULATION FACTOR XII; F12
;;HAGEMAN FACTOR
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Cool and MacGillivray (1987) isolated the entire F12 gene. The coding
sequence consists of multiple domains that are homologous to domains
found in fibronectin (135600) and tissue-type plasminogen activator
(173370). These regions are found as separate exons in the gene. The
5-prime end of the gene does not contain the typical TATA and CAAT
sequences found in other genes. This is consistent with the finding that
transcription of the gene is initiated at multiple sites.

GENE STRUCTURE

Using DNA sequence and restriction enzyme analysis, Cool and
MacGillivray (1987) determined that the F12 gene is approximately 12 kb
long and contains 14 exons. Separate exons encode the functional domains
of the gene. The intron/exon gene organization is similar to that of the
serine protease gene family of plasminogen activators and not the
clotting factor family.

MAPPING

Using a cDNA probe corresponding to amino acids 16 to 183 of the factor
XII protein, Citarella et al. (1987, 1988) mapped factor XII to
chromosome 5 by Southern analysis of DNA from hybrid cells. Using a
genomic sequence as the probe in analysis of somatic cell hybrids and
for in situ hybridization, Riddell et al. (1987) and Royle et al. (1988)
mapped factor XII to 5q33-qter.

GENE FUNCTION

Maas et al. (2008) found that factor XII was activated in vitro by
amorphous misfolded proteins, including amyloid (APP; 104760),
transthyretin (TTR; 176300), albumin, and hemoglobin, but not by amyloid
fibrils. Factor XII activated in this manner led to activation of the
kallikrein (see 147910)-kinin system without inducing coagulation.
Factor XII was activated, and kallikrein was formed in blood from
patients with systemic amyloidosis, which is marked by the accumulation
and deposition of misfolded plasma proteins. The results showed that the
kallikrein-kinin system can be activated by factor XII via a process
separate from the coagulation cascade. Maas et al. (2008) also
postulated a protective role for factor XII following activation by
misfolded protein aggregates by activation of the kallikrein-kinin
system that regulates inflammation and blood pressure.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Factor XII Deficiency

Bernardi et al. (1987) found that a factor XII gene alteration in the
Hageman trait (factor XII deficiency; 234000) was detected by the TaqI
restriction enzyme in 2 affected brothers and 11 members of the paternal
lineage. Gene deletion was excluded. The TaqI polymorphic site was
located within the 5-prime portion of the gene and the mutation in the
polymorphic site was judged to be the cause of the factor XII
deficiency. This may represent a CpG mutation of the sort that is found
in a number of other genes such as the F8 gene (300841) for hemophilia A
(306700).

Bernardi et al. (1988) found an additional TaqI restriction site in
intron 2 of the F12 gene. Since the site was limited to subjects with
total or partial factor XII deficiency, it may represent the true gene
lesion or at least a very tightly linked RFLP. The particular gene
alteration was found in 4 (3 heterozygotes and 1 homozygote) of 5
unrelated Hageman trait subjects from different regions of Italy. In the
homozygous state, the altered gene resulted in very marked reduction in
factor XII activity. No deletion was found in the deficient factor XII
genes.

- Hereditary Angioedema Type III

Dewald and Bork (2006) detected 2 missense mutations in the same codon
of the F12 gene as the cause of hereditary angioedema (HAE) type III
(610618) in 5 unrelated German families. In 4 families affected members
carried a heterozygous thr309-to-lys substitution (T309K; 610619.0007);
affected members of 1 family carried a thr309-to-arg change (T309R;
610619.0007).

In an HAE III-affected family of French origin Cichon et al. (2006)
reported the T309K mutation detected by Dewald and Bork (2006). They
referred to the mutation as T328K. Cichon et al. (2006) compared F12
activity and plasma levels in patients carrying the mutation with that
of healthy control individuals. The data strongly suggested that T328K
is a gain-of-function mutation that markedly increases F12 amadolytic
activity but that does not alter F12 plasma levels. The authors
concluded that enhanced F12 enzymatic plasma activity in female mutation
carriers leads to enhanced kinin production, which results in
angioedema. Transcription of the F12 gene is possibly regulated by
estrogens, which may explain why only women are affected with HAE III.

- Factor XII Quantitative Trait Locus

By genomewide linkage analysis, Calafell et al. (2010) demonstrated that
the F12 gene represents a quantitative trait locus (QTL) that influences
factor XII levels. Resequencing of F12 in 40 unrelated individuals
(selected from the tails of normal distribution of factor XII levels)
identified 26 polymorphisms, which were genotyped in 398 individuals
belonging to 21 Spanish families from the GAIT Project. Eight of 26 SNPs
showed significant association with factor XII levels (p less than
10(-5)). Bayesian quantitative trait nucleotide (BQTN) analysis provided
evidence that only the promoter 46C-T variant (dbSNP rs1801020)
accounted for the variance attributed to this QTL. Calafell et al.
(2010) concluded that the variation in F12 is evolutionarily neutral and
that the T allele of the dbSNP rs1801020 variant appeared approximately
100,000 years ago and spread to most human populations rising to high
frequencies by genetic drift.

ANIMAL MODEL

Renne et al. (2005) found that F12-deficient mice, like F12-deficient
humans, had normal bleeding times and no spontaneous bleeding. However,
in vivo fluorescence microscopy showed that, even though initial
adhesion of platelets at sites of injury was unaffected in F12-deficient
mice, subsequent formation and stabilization of 3-dimensional thrombi
was severely impaired. This defect was observed in several locations in
the vascular system in response to different types of injury and was
completely reversed by infusion of human F12. Renne et al. (2005)
concluded that F12-induced intrinsic coagulation is important for
clotting in vivo, suggesting that F12 may be a target for antithrombotic
therapy.

HISTORY

Roberts (2003) gave an account of the medical and scientific career of
Oscar Ratnoff (born in 1916), who discovered both Hageman factor (factor
XII) and Fitzgerald factor (612358). Ratnoff is credited with recruiting
Earl Davie to the field of blood coagulation, to which Davie introduced
modern biochemical and molecular biologic techniques. Ratnoff and Davie
(1964) and, independently and simultaneously, Macfarlane (1964) proposed
the waterfall hypothesis of blood coagulation. Ratnoff was long
resistant to the use of a system of Roman numerals for the various
clotting factors.

Assignment of the F12 gene based on dosage effect had been inconsistent,
with chromosome 6 and 7 proposed by different authors. Localization of
the F12 locus on chromosome 6 was suggested by Josso and de Grouchy
(1968) and de Grouchy et al. (1968). De Grouchy et al. (1974)
subsequently concluded that the F12 locus is on 7q, probably at the 7q35
band. The revised conclusion was based on the discovery by banding
techniques that the proband did not have a simple deletion of 6p, but
rather part of 6p was translocated to 7q which had a missing distal
segment. Francke (1978) described deletion of 7q35-qter and normal
levels of factor XII, suggesting that the factor XII locus is not on
this part of 7q if on 7q at all. Biederman and Bowen (1978) also
observed normal Hageman factor in a case of deleted 7q32-qter. Kawashima
and Taniguchi (1981) found normal Hageman factor in a boy with de novo
terminal deletion of 7q (7q35-qter). In all, 8 reports failed to
corroborate the de Grouchy-Turleau assignment. Probably the value in de
Grouchy's patient was within low normal range; Hageman factor shows wide
variability normally. The gene for Hageman factor was placed on
chromosome 6p (specifically, 6p23-p25) by Pearson et al. (1982), who
found a reduced level in a patient with 6p-. At the same time, Mattei et
al. (1982) excluded the gene from chromosome 7. Reid et al. (1983)
studied a child with deletion of 6p25-p24 and normal levels of Hageman
factor.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
FACTOR XII (WASHINGTON D.C.)
F12, CYS571SER

Miyata et al. (1989) demonstrated that the functional impairment of
factor XII (Washington D.C.) (234000) is due to replacement of cys571
with serine in the catalytic domain.

.0002
FACTOR XII (LOCARNO)
F12, ARG353PRO

Hovinga et al. (1994) identified the molecular defect in factor XII
(Locarno) (234000), which was found to differ in its dysfunctional
properties from factor XII (Washington D.C.). It lacked both amidolytic
and proteolytic activity. The amino acid sequence of peptides obtained
from factor XII (Locarno) on activation with either trypsin or plasma
kallikrein and dextran sulfate showed an amino acid substitution of
arg353 by pro. Thereby, the kallikrein cleavage site at arg353/val354
was lost.

.0003
FACTOR XII DEFICIENCY
F12, IVS13, 11396G-A, -1

In 5 of 12 unrelated patients with low factor XII activity (234000)
detected by chance during presurgery screening, Schloesser et al. (1995)
found heterozygosity for a G-to-A transition in nucleotide 11396,
resulting in a truncated transcript. The mutation was located in the
3-prime splice acceptor site of intron 13 (i.e., at the junction of
intron 13 and exon 14) where the consensus ag was converted to aa. The
mutation was not found in 74 healthy control subjects. Both compound
heterozygous patients and a homozygous patient lacked immunologic
reactive protein.

.0004
FACTOR XII POLYMORPHISM
F12, 46C-T (dbSNP rs1801020)

Kanaji et al. (1998) identified a nucleotide polymorphism in the F12
gene, a substitution of 46-cytosine by thymidine in untranslated exon 1,
in Japanese. The polymorphism, which was demonstrated by restriction
enzyme HgaI, was 4 bases upstream from the translation initiation ATG
codon. Hence, it was suspected that it might affect efficiency of
translation. Subsequent studies showed that the allele frequency of
46C-T was 0.27-0.73 in Japanese and 0.8-0.2 in Caucasians. Because it
had been reported that plasma levels of factor XII are lower in East
Asians than in Caucasians, Kanaji et al. (1998) investigated the
relationship between the polymorphism and plasma levels of factor XII.
They found that the 3 genotypes had different levels: C/C, 170; C/T,
141; and T/T, 82. As determined by RT/PCR, both alleles were equally
transcribed in hepatocytes of heterozygotes; however, in vitro
transcription/translation analysis showed that less factor XII was
produced in cDNA containing 46T than from that containing 46C.
Therefore, it was considered highly likely that the 46T polymorphism
decreases the efficiency of translation, probably due to the creation of
another ATG codon and/or impairment of the consensus sequence for the
translation initiation scanning model.

Endler et al. (2001) studied the impact of the 46 C-to-T polymorphism on
the development of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). They compared 303
patients with acute coronary syndrome and 227 patients with stable
coronary artery disease. The authors found a 2.5-fold lower prevalence
of the 46T genotype in patients with ACS, which they interpreted to
indicate a protective effect on the development of ACS in patients with
preexisting stable coronary artery disease.

Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is considered a global test
of thrombotic tendency. A shortened aPTT is associated with an increased
risk of thrombosis as well as several prothrombotic risk factors
including age, female sex, estrogen use, and obesity. Prolonged aPTT is
an indicator of coagulation disorders in patients with deficiencies of
factors in the intrinsic pathways of coagulation. Houlihan et al. (2010)
conducted a genomewide association study for activated partial
thromboplastin time (aPTT) in a total of 1,477 relatively healthy adults
from the Lothian Birth Cohorts of 1936 (LBC1936) and 1921 (LBC1921). The
strongest association obtained in their study was a SNP approximately
5.8 kb upstream of the F12 gene, dbSNP rs2731672 (combined p = 2.16 x
10(-30)). The effects of dbSNP rs2731672 were additive, with each A
allele increasing aPTT by 0.45 standard deviations. This SNP explained
9.6% and 6.6% of the variation in aPTT in LBC1936 and LBC1921,
respectively. The SNP dbSNP rs2731672 correlated highly (r(2) = 0.87)
with the F12 46C-T polymorphism dbSNP rs1801020, which has been
associated with variation in plasma levels of factor XII. The
association of the A allele of dbSNP rs2731672, corresponding to the T
allele of the 46C-T polymorphism, with prolonged aPTT was not the
expected biological direction of effect; Houlihan et al. (2010) noted
that other prothrombotic phenotypes and coagulation deficiencies, such
as lupus anticoagulants, are associated with prolongation, not
shortening, of the aPTT in vitro.

.0005
FACTOR XII (TENRI)
F12, TYR34CYS

Kondo et al. (1999) performed a mutation screen on a patient with
crossreacting material (CRM)-negative factor XII deficiency (234000) who
had 3% both of antigen and activity levels. They identified an A-to-G
substitution at nucleotide 7832 in exon 3 of the F12 gene, resulting in
a tyr34-to-cys substitution in the N-terminal type II domain of factor
XII. They designated this mutation factor XII Tenri. The proband was
homozygous; the parents and a sister were heterozygous. Based on their
studies, Kondo et al. (1999) speculated that the majority of factor XII
Tenri is degraded intracellularly through a quality-control mechanism in
the endoplasmic reticulum, and a small amount of factor XII Tenri that
forms a disulfide-linked heterodimer with alpha-1-microglobulin (176870)
is secreted into the bloodstream.

.0006
ANGIOEDEMA, HEREDITARY, TYPE III
F12, THR309LYS

In affected members of 5 German families with hereditary angioedema
(HAE) type III (610618), Dewald and Bork (2006) detected heterozygosity
for a 1032C-A transversion in exon 9 of the F12 gene that gave rise to a
substitution of lysine for threonine at codon 309 of the mature protein
(T309K).

Cichon et al. (2006) reported this mutation in an HAE III-affected
family of French origin, referring to the mutation as THR328LYS (T328K).
Haplotype analysis suggested that the 2 families shared a common
founder. Functional data demonstrated that T328K is an activating
mutation that most probably causes angioedema through a
bradykinin-driven pathomechanism.

.0007
ANGIOEDEMA, HEREDITARY, TYPE III
F12, THR309ARG

In a family of German origin with HAE type III (610618), Dewald and Bork
(2006) detected heterozygosity for a 1032C-G transversion in exon 9 of
the F12 gene that gave rise to a substitution of arginine for threonine
at codon 309 of the mature protein (T309K).

609412	TITLE *609412 EXCISION-REPAIR CROSS-COMPLEMENTING, GROUP 8; ERCC8
;;CSA GENE;;
CKN1 GENE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ERCC8 gene is part of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway,
a complex system that eliminates a broad spectrum of structural DNA
lesions, including ultraviolet (UV)-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine
dimers, bulky chemical adducts, and DNA cross-links. One of the NER
pathways preferentially repairs lesions on the transcribed strand of
active genes; this process occurs more rapidly than repairs on
nontranscribed strands that are part of overall genome repair (Troelstra
et al., 1992).

CLONING

Henning et al. (1995) cloned the human CKN1 gene, which they called CSA,
by functional complementation of cells derived from patients with
Cockayne syndrome A (CSA; 216400). They found that the CSA cDNA uniquely
and specifically corrected UV sensitivity in CSA cells. The predicted
396-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of approximately
44 kD and contains a WD repeat (WD40 repeat) domain as reviewed by Neer
et al. (1994). In vitro translated CSA protein specifically interacted
with the CSB (ERCC6; 609413) protein and p44 protein (GTF2H2; 601748), a
subunit of the RNA polymerase II basal transcription factor TFIIH (see
also 189972). These observations, coupled with the observation that the
amino acid sequence of the predicted CSB polypeptide is homologous with
a component of the yeast Swi/Snf transcriptional activation complex,
suggested that Cockayne syndrome cells are defective in RNA polymerase
II transcription.

MAPPING

By Southern blot hybridization in human/rodent hybrid cell DNA, Henning
et al. (1995) mapped the CSA gene to chromosome 5.

GENE FUNCTION

Damage to actively transcribed DNA is preferentially repaired by the
transcription-coupled repair (TCR) system, which requires RNA polymerase
II (pol II). Bregman et al. (1996) demonstrated that a fraction of the
large subunit of pol II (POL2R; 180660) was ubiquitinated after exposing
cells to UV-radiation or cisplatin but not several other DNA-damaging
agents. This novel covalent modification of POL2R occurred within 15
minutes of exposing cells to UV-radiation and persisted for about 8 to
12 hours. Ubiquitinated POL2R was also phosphorylated on the C-terminal
domain. UV-induced ubiquitination of POL2R was deficient in fibroblasts
from persons with either Cockayne syndrome A or B (133540). In both of
these disorders, transcription-coupled repair is disrupted. UV-induced
ubiquitination of POL2R could be restored by introducing cDNA constructs
encoding the CSA or CSB genes, respectively, into CSA or CSB
fibroblasts. These results suggested that ubiquitination of POL2R plays
a role in the recognition and/or repair of damage to actively
transcribed genes. Alternatively, these findings may reflect a role
played by the CSA and CSB gene products in transcription, a possibility
that had been suggested on other grounds.

Van Gool et al. (1997) noted that there is evidence that basic metabolic
processes within the cell are intimately linked and influenced by one
another. One such link is the close interplay between nucleotide
excision DNA repair and transcription, as illustrated both by the
preferential repair of the transcribed strand of active genes (TCR) and
by the distinct dual involvement of proteins in both processes. In E.
coli, 1 protein, the transcription repair-coupling factor, accomplishes
the dual function. On the basis of experimental observations, van Gool
et al. (1997) suggested that the situation in eukaryotes is more
complex, involving dual functionality of multiple proteins. They
suggested that Cockayne syndrome may represent a defect in TCR.

By immunoprecipitation analysis of HeLa cells, Groisman et al. (2003)
identified DDB2 (600811) and CSA as components of similar but distinct
protein complexes. Both DDB2 and CSA interacted with DDB1 (600045), a
component of both complexes. Cullin-4A (CUL4A; 603137), ROC1 (RBX1;
603814), and all the subunits of the COP9 signalosome (e.g., COPS2;
604508) were also present in both complexes. Following UV irradiation,
the DDB2 complex bound tightly to chromatin in a UV-dependent manner and
initiated global genome repair, whereas the CSA complex bound to RNA
polymerase II and initiated TCR. The COP9 signalosome in each complex
differentially regulated cullin-based ubiquitin ligase activity in
response to UV irradiation.

Using an in vivo crosslinking approach with chromatin
immunoprecipitation in UV-irradiated normal human fibroblasts, Fousteri
et al. (2006) found that lesion-stalled RNA polymerase II did not
dissociate from its template during assembly of the TCR complex, and
that CSB and CSA had different roles in TCR complex formation. CSB was a
prerequisite factor for the assembly of NER proteins and histone
acetyltransferase p300 (EP300; 602700) to stalled RNA pol II, whereas
functional CSA, in addition to CSB, was required to recruit the
nucleosomal binding proteins HMGN1 (163920), XAB2 (610850), and TFIIS
(see TCEA1, 601425).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Cockayne Syndrome A

Henning et al. (1995) identified mutations in the ERCC8 gene in CSA
cDNAs of all CSA cell lines examined, including an identical mutation in
2 CSA sibs (609412.0001).

In a cell line from an 11-year-old girl with CSA, Cao et al. (2004)
identified compound heterozygosity for a nonsense mutation (E13X;
609412.0003) and a missense mutation (A205P; 609412.0005) in the ERCC8
gene.

In a cell line from a patient with CSA, Ridley et al. (2005) identified
compound heterozygosity for an E13X mutation and a novel missense
mutation (A160V; 609412.0004) in the ERCC8 gene.

Bertola et al. (2006) analyzed the ERCC8 gene in 8 patients from 6
Brazilian families with typical CSA and identified homozygosity or
compound heterozygosity for ERCC8 mutations in all of them. The authors
stated that there was no obvious genotype/phenotype correlation across
the mutation spectrum.

- UV-Sensitive Syndrome 2

In a 15-year-old French girl with UV-sensitive syndrome-2 (UVSS2;
614621), Nardo et al. (2009) identified a homozygous mutation in the
ERCC8 gene (W361C; 609412.0006). She had sun sensitivity and freckling,
but no other abnormalities. Patient-derived fibroblasts showed a reduced
recovery of RNA synthesis after UV irradiation and a defective capacity
to repair UV-induced damage on the transcribed strand of active genes,
indicating a defect in transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair
(TC-NER). However, there was no hypersensitivity to reactive oxygen
species, and UV-induced DNA repair synthesis and global genome NER
(GG-NER) were normal. Nardo et al. (2009) hypothesized that the mild
phenotype in this patient was due to the lack of cellular sensitivity to
oxidative stress.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
COCKAYNE SYNDROME A
ERCC8, 279-BP DEL, 81-BP DEL

In 2 sibs, born of consanguineous parents, with Cockayne syndrome A
(216400), Henning et al. (1995) identified 2 deletions in the ERCC8
gene. One deletion removed 279 bp from the CKN1 coding region, starting
at nucleotide 880 of their sequence and ending at nucleotide 1158. A
second deletion of 81 bp in the CKN1 region started at nucleotide
position 1078 and also ended at nucleotide position 1158. The fact that
the deletions identified in both cDNAs from both sibs ended at the
identical nucleotide positions strongly suggested to the authors that
this nucleotide marks an exon/intron junction and the truncated cDNAs
represent abnormally spliced products missing either 1 (81 bp) or 2 (279
bp) upstream exons. These abnormal splice products presumably derived
from a homozygous mutation in a splice donor site. Neither deletion
created a frameshift. Hence, the 2 abnormal transcripts potentially
encode internally deleted proteins with predicted sizes of 303 and 369
amino acids.

.0002
COCKAYNE SYNDROME A
ERCC8, TYR322TER

In a cell line derived from a patient with Cockayne syndrome A (216400),
Henning et al. (1995) identified a C-to-A transversion in the ERCC8
gene, resulting in a tyr322-to-ter (Y322X) substitution.

McDaniel et al. (1997) demonstrated that the Y322X mutation was present
in homozygous state, using a strategy with general applicability.
Somatic cell hybrids were established by fusing patient cells with mouse
A9 cells. Screening with chromosome 5-specific polymorphic markers
facilitated identification of hybrid clones bearing only 1 of the
distinct CSA alleles. Sequencing a portion of the human CSA gene in a
subset of these hybrids permitted monoallelic mutation analysis and
confirmed the presence of the Y322X mutation in both alleles.

Khayat et al. (2010) analyzed the Y322X mutation in the Arab Christian
population of northern Israel and found a carrier frequency of 6.79.
Haplotype analysis as well as the high carrier frequency suggested that
Y322X is an ancient founder mutation that may have originated in the
Christian Lebanese community.

.0003
COCKAYNE SYNDROME A
ERCC8, GLU13TER

In a cell line from a patient with Cockayne syndrome A (216400), Cao et
al. (2004) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
ERCC8 gene: a G-to-T transversion, resulting in a glu13-to-ter (E13X)
substitution, and A205P (609412.0005). The patient was an 11-year-old
girl with photophobia, dwarfism, mental retardation, cataracts,
retinopathy, and optic atrophy.

.0004
COCKAYNE SYNDROME A
ERCC8, ALA160VAL

In a cell line from a patient with Cockayne syndrome A (216400), Ridley
et al. (2005) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
ERCC8 gene: a 479C-T transition, resulting in an ala160-to-val (A160V)
substitution between the second and third WD40 repeats, and E13X
(609412.0003). No CSA protein was detected in the cells.

.0005
COCKAYNE SYNDROME A
ERCC8, ALA205PRO

In a cell line from a patient with Cockayne syndrome A (216400), Cao et
al. (2004) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
ERCC8 gene: a 649G-C transversion, resulting in an ala205-to-pro (A205P)
substitution, and E13X (609412.0003).

.0006
UV-SENSITIVE SYNDROME 2
ERCC8, TRP361CYS

In a 15-year-old French girl with UV-sensitive syndrome-2 (UVSS2;
614621), Nardo et al. (2009) identified a homozygous 1083G-T
transversion in the ERCC8 gene, resulting in a trp361-to-cys (W361C)
substitution within the last putative WD domain. Her unaffected mother
was heterozygous for the mutation. Patient-derived fibroblasts showed a
reduced recovery of RNA synthesis after UV irradiation and a defective
capacity to repair UV-induced damage on the transcribed strand of active
genes, indicating a defect in transcription-coupled nucleotide excision
repair (TC-NER). However, there was no hypersensitivity to reactive
oxygen species, and UV-induced DNA repair synthesis and global genome
NER (GG-NER) were normal. Transfection of the construct expressing the
mutant protein into normal cells caused a defect in RNA synthesis after
UV irradiation. The patient presented at age 4 months with sun
sensitivity manifest as easy sun burning and erythema. She had numerous
freckles on her face and exposed areas of the neck, but no history or
evidence of cutaneous tumors. Psychomotor development was normal. Nardo
et al. (2009) hypothesized that the mild phenotype in this patient was
due to the lack of cellular sensitivity to oxidative stress.

611735	TITLE *611735 CUB DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; CDCP1
;;SIMA135
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using differential display to identify genes upregulated in lung and
colon carcinomas, followed by PCR of a nonsmall cell lung cancer cell
line cDNA library, Scherl-Mostageer et al. (2001) cloned CDCP1. The
deduced 836-amino acid protein has an N-terminal signal peptide,
followed by 3 extracellular CUB domains, a transmembrane region, and an
intracellular domain containing a hexalysine stretch and a proline-rich
region. The extracellular region contains 12 potential N-glycosylation
sites. Northern blot analysis detected a 6-kb transcript in several
human cell lines and tissues. RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis revealed
highest CDCP1 expression in colon and lung adenocarcinomas. Expression
was lower in normal colon, lung, testis, esophagus, stomach, rectum,
prostate, placenta, and peripheral blood lymphocytes, and no expression
was detected in pancreas.

By sequencing peptide fragments of a protein highly expressed in the
metastatic human epidermoid carcinoma cell line HEp3, followed by
database analysis, Hooper et al. (2003) identified CDCP1, which they
designated SIMA135. The deduced 836-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 92.9 kD. Cleavage of the signal sequence results in a
mature protein that begins at phe30 and has a calculated molecular mass
of 90.1 kD. The mature protein contains 2 putative CUB domains, a
consensus type-1 palmitoylation motif, and 5 PxxP motifs that mediate
binding to Src (190090) homology-3 domains. Northern blot analysis
detected highest expression of a 6.0-kb transcript in skeletal muscle
and colon, with lower expression in kidney, small intestine, placenta,
and lung, and weak expression in peripheral blood leukocytes. Expression
was not detected in brain, heart, thymus, spleen, and liver. A minor
3.3-kb transcript was detected in skeletal muscle, colon, placenta, and
lung. Western blot analysis showed a 135-kD CDCP1 protein in HEp3 cells,
and glycosidase treatment resulted in a broad band between 95 and 105
kD. Antiphosphotyrosine antibody revealed that CDCP1 was tyrosine
phosphorylated. A soluble 110-kD CDCP1 protein was secreted into
conditioned medium harvested from HEp3 cells. Immunohistochemical
analysis detected CDCP1 on the luminal and basal surfaces of cells
lining the colonic lumen and on the apical surfaces of cells lining
glandular crypts. Staining was also detected in the contents of goblet
cells of the crypts and in the mucus in the lumen of glands.

Using flow cytometry, Conze et al. (2003) showed that CDCP1 was
expressed on CD34 (142230)-positive hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells,
but not on other peripheral blood subsets.

Brown et al. (2004) identified 2 putative tyrosine phosphorylation
motifs and 2 type II Src homology-3 ligand-binding sites in the
C-terminal domain of CDCP1. Cdcp1 was expressed in cultured mouse
epithelial cells, but not in fibroblasts.

Perry et al. (2007) isolated a CDCP1 splice variant that encodes a
deduced 343-amino acid protein, which they called isoform-2. Isoform-2
is identical to isoform-1 for the first 341 amino acids, including the
N-terminal signal sequence and first CUB domain, but it terminates in 2
unique amino acids. Both transcripts were detected in several colorectal
carcinoma tissues and cell lines and in cervical and lung tumor cell
lines. Immunofluorescence microscopy detected isoform-1 on the cell
surface and isoform-2 in the cytoplasm of transfected Chinese hamster
ovary cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Brown et al. (2004) found that trypsinization of adherent cultured human
foreskin keratinocytes converted endogenous CDCP1 from a 140-kD
glycoprotein (gp140) to an 80-kD glycoprotein (p80) by removing
carbohydrates and the N-terminal sequence prior to a cleavage site
within the first CUB domain of gp140. De-adhesion was accompanied by
tyrosine phosphorylation of CDCP1 on intracellular tyr734 by Src family
kinases, and re-adhesion was associated with dephosphorylation of tyr734
by protein tyrosine phosphatases (see 176884). Plasmin (173350), but not
thrombin (F2; 176930), converted gp140 to p80, suggesting that this
processing may occur during wounding of epidermis. An endogenous
plasmin-like protease in mouse epidermis converted gp140 to p80,
suggesting that the level of gp140 may be decreased in epithelial wounds
in vivo.

Using reporter assays and small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown
experiments, Kimura et al. (2006) showed that ZFP67 (ZBTB7B; 607646)
enhanced CDCP1 transcription in the human hematopoietic cell line K562,
but not in Jurkat cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies showed
that ZFP67 bound to the CCP1 promoter in K562 cells, but not in Jurkat
cells. Kimura et al. (2006) found a correlation between methylation of
CpG sequences in the promoter region of CDCP1 and CDCP1 expression.
Demethylation of the CpG sequences in lymphocytes induced CDCP1
expression, and its expression was further increased with ZFP67
overexpression.

GENE STRUCTURE

Scherl-Mostageer et al. (2001) determined that the CDCP1 gene contains 8
exons. Perry et al. (2007) stated that the CDCP1 gene contains 9 exons.

MAPPING

Using FISH, Scherl-Mostageer et al. (2001) mapped the CDCP1 gene to
chromosome 3p23-p21.

603715	TITLE *603715 GLIAL CELLS MISSING, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 1; GCM1
;;GCMA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

In the Drosophila nervous system, the 'glial cells missing' (gcm) gene
is transiently expressed in glial precursors to switch their fate from
the neuronal default to glia. Akiyama et al. (1996) demonstrated that
the N-terminal region of gcm binds to DNA in a sequence-specific manner.
Eleven gcm-binding sites are found in the 5-prime region of the 'repo'
gene, whose expression is dependent on gcm.

CLONING

By searching an EST database and by using RACE, Akiyama et al. (1996)
identified cDNAs encoding GCMA, a human homolog of gcm. The predicted
GCMA protein contains 436 amino acids. They also isolated cDNAs encoding
2 mouse gcm homologs, Gcma and Gcmb. The mammalian proteins share a
conserved N-terminal region of approximately 150 amino acids that
corresponds to the DNA-binding domain of gcm. The gcm motif of GCMA
exhibited specific DNA-binding activity similar to that of gcm. Akiyama
et al. (1996) concluded that the gcm motif defines a family of novel
DNA-binding proteins, and may function in various aspects of cell fate
determination.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yamada et al. (2000) determined that the GCM1 gene contains 6 exons,
spans about 22 kb, and is similar in overall organization to the mouse
homolog. The gene contains several potential binding sites for
transcriptions factors, including GATA-binding proteins, OCT1 (POU2F1;
164175), and basic helix-loop-helix proteins. The 5-prime flanking
region includes a motif for GCM protein binding.

MAPPING

By FISH, Yamada et al. (2000) mapped the GCM1 gene to chromosome 6p.

ANIMAL MODEL

Trophoblast cells of the placenta are established at the blastocyst
stage and differentiate into specialized subtypes after implantation. In
mammals, the placenta is the major, if not exclusive, site of GCM1
expression. Anson-Cartwright et al. (2000) showed that mouse Gcm1 is
expressed in small clusters of chorionic trophoblast cells at the flat
chorionic plate stage and at sites of chorioallantoic folding and
extension when morphogenesis begins. Mutation of Gcm1 in mice causes a
complete block to branching of the chorioallantoic interface, resulting
in embryonic mortality by embryonic day 10 due to absence of the
placental labyrinth. In addition, chorionic trophoblast cells in
Gcm1-deficient placentas do not fuse to form syncytiotrophoblast.
Abnormal development of placental villi is frequently associated with
fetal death and intrauterine growth restriction in humans.

Schreiber et al. (2000) reported a similar study indicating that mice
lacking Gcm1 failed to form the labyrinthine layer and succumbed to
placental insufficiency. Rinkenberger and Werb (2000) pointed out that
fetal nutrition is dependent on the branching of a layer of placental
trophoblast cells that sits between the maternal blood and fetal blood
vessels. The discovery that expression of the transcription factor Gcm1
in trophoblast stem cells regulates branching of this specialized
epithelium offered new insights into a process of pivotal importance to
the function of the placenta.

Gunther et al. (2000) generated mice deficient in Gcm2 (603716) by
targeted disruption. These mice had no parathyroid glands; however, they

identified the thymus, where Gcm1 is expressed, as an additional,

;;AXL RECEPTOR TYROSINE KINASE LIGAND; AXLLG;;
AXL STIMULATORY FACTOR; AXSF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Manfioletti et al. (1993) described a growth arrest-specific gene whose
cDNA was isolated from NIH 3T3 cells starved for serum. The gene,
designated gas6 by the authors, is expressed as an abundant 2.6-kb mRNA
in starved cells but decreases significantly upon stimulation of cells
with serum or fibroblast growth factor. A human homolog was isolated
from HeLa cells and was predicted to encode a 678-amino acid protein
with 81% identity to the mouse protein and 44% identity to human protein
S (176880), a vitamin K-dependent negative coregulator in the blood
coagulation pathway. Regions of greatest similarity between Gas6 and
protein S occur in a gamma carboxylated glutamic acid-rich domain and in
4 EGF-like domains.

GENE FUNCTION

Studying the function of the AXL receptor tyrosine kinase (109135),
Varnum et al. (1995) postulated that AXL may be involved in the
stimulation of cell proliferation in response to an appropriate signal,
i.e., a ligand that activates the receptor. They purified an AXL
stimulatory factor and showed that it is identical to the product of the
GAS6 gene.

Stitt et al. (1995) likewise found that protein S and its relative GAS6
are ligands for the TYRO3 (600341) and AXL family of receptor tyrosine
kinases found in rodent and human. The function of GAS6 was unknown,
although its homology to protein S and its ability to bind AXL suggested
roles both in clotting and in other systems.

The product of the GAS6 gene, a ligand for the AXL, MER (604705), and
TYRO3 tyrosine kinase receptors, is a vitamin K-dependent protein,
structurally related to anticoagulant protein S but lacking its
anticoagulant activity. Gas6 deficient mice are protected against
thrombosis (Angelillo-Scherrer et al., 2001; Yanagita et al., 2002),
demonstrating the importance of this protein in the cardiovascular
system. Munoz et al. (2004) determined the intron-exon structure of GAS6
and analyzed the gene for the presence of allelic variants that could be
associated with atherothrombotic disease. Using in silico analyses, they
determined the sequence of the GAS6 gene, which spans 43.8 kb of DNA and
consists of 15 exons. They also identified 8 different variants that
were confirmed to be SNPs. A preliminary analysis of 5 of these SNPs in
a group of 110 healthy controls and 188 patients with atherothrombotic
disease suggested a statistically significant difference between
controls and stroke patients in the allelic distributions of one of
these variants, 834+7G-A.

Pseudotypes are viral particles that carry the genome of one virus and 1
or more proteins of another virus (Temperton and Wright, 2009). Morizono
et al. (2011) studied the infectivity of lentivirus pseudotypes lacking
envelope binding and observed residual high infectivity for some cell
types. The retained infectivity was conferred by soluble bovine protein
S in the culture medium. Morizono et al. (2011) showed that bovine
protein S and its human homolog, GAS6, mediated binding of the virus to
target cells by bridging virion envelope phosphatidylserine to AXL
present on target cells.

MAPPING

Saccone et al. (1995) mapped human GAS6 to chromosome 13q34 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. Colombo et al. (1992) mapped the
Gas6 gene to mouse chromosome 8.

ANIMAL MODEL

Angelillo-Scherrer et al. (2001) generated Gas6 -/- mice and found that
they were protected against venous and arterial thrombosis but did not
display spontaneous bleeding and had normal bleeding after tail
clipping. Gas6 antibodies inhibited platelet aggregation in vitro and
protected mice against fatal thromboembolism without causing bleeding in
vivo. Gas6 amplified platelet aggregation and secretion in response to
known agonists. The platelet dysfunction in Gas6 -/- mice resembled that
of patients with platelet signaling transduction defects.
Angelillo-Scherrer et al. (2001) concluded that although GAS6 appears to
be redundant for baseline hemostasis, it is a platelet response
amplifier that plays a significant role in pathologic thrombosis.

Angelillo-Scherrer et al. (2005) generated mice lacking 1 of the 3 Gas6
receptors: Tyro3, Axl, or Mertk. Loss of any 1 of the Gas6 receptors or
delivery of a soluble extracellular domain of Axl that traps Gas6
protected the mice against life-threatening thrombosis. Loss of a Gas6
receptor did not prevent initial platelet aggregation but impaired
subsequent stabilization of platelet aggregates, at least in part by
reducing outside-in signaling and platelet granule secretion. Gas6,
through its receptors, activated PI3K and Akt (see 164730) and
stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the beta-3 integrin (173470),
thereby amplifying outside-in signaling via alpha-IIb (607759)-beta-3.

;;NONMETASTATIC PROTEIN 23, HOMOLOG 5; NM23H5
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The nucleoside diphosphate (NDP) kinases (EC 2.7.4.6) are ubiquitous
enzymes that catalyze transfer of gamma-phosphates, via a
phosphohistidine intermediate, between nucleoside and dioxynucleoside
tri- and diphosphates. The enzymes are products of the NM23 (156490)
gene family. Munier et al. (1998) identified a novel homolog of NM23 in
the EST database. They used PCR to clone the full coding sequence from
several human cDNA libraries. The NME5 gene encodes a 212-amino acid
polypeptide with homology to the NDP kinases. Northern blot analysis
detected abundant expression of a 1.1-kb mRNA in testis. In situ
hybridization to testis revealed NME5 mRNA in the seminiferous tubules
in a pattern consistent with stage-specific expression in germinal cells
during spermatogenesis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lai et al. (2001) determined that the NME5 gene contains 6 exons and
spans more than 40 kb.

MAPPING

Munier et al. (1998) used radiation hybrid panels to map the NME5 gene
to human chromosome 5q23-q31.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Double-stranded RNA viruses are recognized in a cell type-dependent
manner by the transmembrane receptor TLR3 (603029) or by the cytoplasmic
RNA helicases MDA5 (606951) and RIGI (DDX58; 609631). These interactions
initiate signaling pathways that differ in their initial steps but
converge in the activation of the protein kinases IKKA (CHUK; 600664)
and IKKB (IKBKB; 603258), which activate NFKB (see 164011), or TBK1
(604834) and IKKE (IKBKE; 605048), which activate IRF3 (603734).
Activated IRF3 and NFKB induce transcription of IFNB (IFNB1; 147640).
For the TLR3 pathway, the intermediary molecule before the pathways
converge is the cytoplasmic protein TRIF (TICAM1; 607601). For RIGI, the
intermediary protein is mitochondria-bound IPS1 (Sen and Sarkar, 2005).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned KIAA1271. The transcript contains
several repetitive elements in its 3-prime UTR, and the deduced protein
contains 542 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA detected intermediate expression
in all tissues and specific brain regions examined except testis and
fetal brain, in which expression was low.

By screening for proteins that activated the NFKB and MAPK (see MAPK1;
176948) signaling pathways, followed by database analysis, Xu et al.
(2005) identified 2 VISA splice variants. Both transcripts encode a
deduced 540-amino acid protein with an N-terminal CARD module followed
by a TRAF2 (601895)-binding motif and 2 TRAF6 (602355)-binding motifs.
Northern blot analysis detected 9.5- and 3.4-kb VISA transcripts in all
tissues examined. Western blot analysis detected endogenous VISA at
about 62 kD in human cell lines.

Independently, Seth et al. (2005), Kawai et al. (2005), and Meylan et
al. (2005) also cloned and characterized VISA, which they called MAVS,
IPS1, and CARDIF, respectively. Seth et al. (2005) identified a
C-terminal transmembrane domain in MAVS that targets the protein to
mitochondria.

GENE FUNCTION

Xu et al. (2005) demonstrated that VISA is critical in the IFNB (147640)
signaling pathway and is required for both Sendai virus-triggered
TLR3-mediated and TLR3-independent signaling. In the TLR3-mediated
signaling pathway, VISA interacted with TRIF and TRAF6 and mediated
bifurcation of the NFKB and IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE)
activation pathways. In the TLR3-independent signaling pathway, VISA and
RIGI interacted via their respective CARD modules, and VISA functioned
as an adaptor to recruit downstream components, such as IRF3, to the
RIGI complex. Xu et al. (2005) concluded that VISA plays essential roles
in antiviral responses by participating in 2 virus-triggered IFN
signaling pathways.

Seth et al. (2005) showed that silencing of MAVS through RNA
interference abolished NFKB and IRF3 activation by viruses, leading to
increased viral replication. In contrast, MAVS overexpression induced
IFNB expression following NFKB and IRF3 activation. Additional
interference, knockdown, and mutation analyses indicated that MAVS
functions downstream of RIGI and that its CARD is essential for MAVS
signaling. Seth et al. (2005) confirmed by mutation analysis, confocal
microscopy, and subcellular fractionation that the C-terminal
transmembrane domain of MAVS is required for IFNB activation and for
localization to the outer mitochondrial membrane. When targeted to other
membrane locations, MAVS failed to activate IFNB. Seth et al. (2005)
concluded that MAVS function leads to stronger antiviral immunity and
proposed that mitochondria may have a role in innate immunity.

Kawai et al. (2005) also characterized IPS1 function and found that the
CARD of IPS1 interacted with the CARDs of RIGI and MDA5. Overexpression
of IPS1 resulted in activation of IFNB, IP10 (CXCL10; 147310), and
RANTES (CCL5; 187011). IPS1 overexpression also enhanced IFNA4 (147564)
and IFNA6 (147566) expression when coexpressed with IRF7 (605047).

In addition to the interactions documented by Seth et al. (2005) and
Kawai et al. (2005), Meylan et al. (2005) found that the NS3-4A serine
protease from hepatitis C virus (HCV; see 609532) targets and
inactivates CARDIF. They determined that NS3-4A cleaves CARDIF after
cys508, thereby blocking IRF3 activation and IFNB production.

Independently, Li et al. (2005) demonstrated that HCV NS3-4A cleaves
MAVS at cys508. Immunoprecipitation analysis and confocal microscopy
showed that NS3-4A bound to and colocalized with MAVS in mitochondria.
Li et al. (2005) proposed that sequence variation in MAVS might account
for the exposed individuals who mount a successful immune response
against HCV and other viruses that inhibit IFN production by attacking
MAVS or other mitochondrial proteins.

Moore et al. (2008) showed that NLRX1 (611947), a highly conserved
nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-containing
(NLR) family member, localizes to the mitochondrial outer membrane and
interacts with MAVS. Expression of NLRX1 resulted in the potent
inhibition of RIG (609631)-like helicase (RLH) family and MAVS-mediated
IFNB promoter activity and in the disruption of virus-induced RLH-MAVS
interactions. Depletion of NLRX1 with small interference RNA promoted
virus-induced type I interferon (see 147570) production and decreased
viral replication. Moore et al. (2008) concluded that their work
identified NLRX1 as a check against mitochondrial antiviral responses
and represented an intersection of 3 ancient cellular processes: NLR
signaling, intracellular virus detection, and the use of mitochondria as
a platform for antipathogen signaling. They also concluded that their
work represented a conceptual advance, in that NLRX1 is a modulator of
pathogen-associated molecular pattern receptors rather than a receptor,
and identified a key therapeutic target for enhancing antiviral
responses.

Using a cell-free system, Hou et al. (2011) showed that after viral
infection MAVS formed large aggregates that potently activated IRF3. The
aggregates formed self-perpetuating, fiber-like polymers that
efficiently converted endogenous MAVS into functional aggregates. These
properties closely resembled those of prions (see 176640), including
fibrous aggregates, detergent and protease resistance, and the ability
to 'infect' endogenous protein and convert the native conformation into
fibrous aggregates. The formation of MAVS aggregates resulted in a gain
of function, and the conformational change was tightly regulated by
viral infection. Incubation of endogenous MAVS with RIGI, mitochondria,
and lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains also converted MAVS into
functional aggregates. Hou et al. (2011) proposed that a prion-like
conformational switch of MAVS activates and propagates the antiviral
signaling cascade.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1999) mapped the KIAA1271
gene to chromosome 20.

ANIMAL MODEL

Sun et al. (2006) found that deletion of Mavs in mice abolished viral
induction of interferon and prevented activation of Nfkb and Irf3 in
multiple cell types, but not plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Interferon
expression in response to cytosolic DNA or Listeria monocytogenes was
not affected by Mavs deficiency, and viability and fertility were not
compromised. Mavs -/- mice challenged with vesicular stomatitis virus
had significantly higher viral titers than Mavs +/- or wildtype mice 12
to 48 hours after infection, but not 72 hours after infection. Mavs -/-
and Mavs +/- mice, but not most wildtype mice, succumbed to infection in
a dose- and Mavs-dependent manner. Sun et al. (2006) concluded that
cytosolic viral signaling through MAVS is required for innate immune
responses against viral infection.

Kumar et al. (2006) found that Ips1-deficient mice had defective
induction of type I Ifn and inflammatory cytokines after infection with
various RNA viruses and were susceptible to the RNA virus infection.
However, Ips1 was not essential for responses to DNA viruses. Kumar et
al. (2006) concluded that IPS1 is an essential component in RIGI- and
MDA5-dependent signaling that triggers the host response to infection
with various RNA viruses.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The LIM domain is a double zinc finger structure that promotes
protein-protein interactions. LIM domain proteins, such as ABLIM3, play
roles in embryonic development, cell lineage determination, and cancer
(Krupp et al., 2006).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned ABLIM3, which they designated
KIAA0843. The transcript contains a repetitive element at its 3-prime
end, and the deduced 683-amino acid protein shares significant
similarity with ABLIM1 (602330). RT-PCR ELISA detected highest
expression in adult liver, with moderate expression in all other adult
and fetal tissues examined except adult pancreas and testis, which
showed little to no expression. Expression was high in cerebellum and
moderate in all other adult brain regions examined.

By searching for genes similar to ABLIM1, Krupp et al. (2006) identified
ABLIM3. The deduced protein contains 4 LIM domains, a C-terminal VHD
domain, and a putative nuclear localization signal. Mouse and human
ABLIM3 share 98% amino acid identity. ABLIM3 is conserved in
vertebrates, but not in invertebrates.

GENE FUNCTION

Barrientos et al. (2007) showed that both ABLIM2 (612544) and ABLIM3
bound strongly to F-actin, localized to actin stress fibers in a mouse
myoblast cell line, and synergistically enhanced Stars (ABRA;
609747)-dependent activation of Srf (600589) in reporter gene assays.
Knockdown of endogenous Ablim1, Ablim2, and Ablim3 expression via small
interfering RNA blunted Srf-dependent transcription in mouse skeletal
muscle cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Krupp et al. (2006) determined that the ABLIM3 gene contains 24 exons
and spans 119 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the ABLIM3
gene to chromosome 5. Krupp et al. (2006) mapped the ABLIM3 gene to
chromosome 5q32 by genomic sequence analysis.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases, Roussigne et al. (2003) identified several
proteins containing an N-terminal THAP domain, including THAP5. The THAP
domain of the deduced 395-amino acid THAP5 protein includes a C2CH
signature, an AVPTIF box, and several other conserved amino acids.

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the THAP5 gene to chromosome 7q31.1 based on an
alignment of the THAP5 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC053634) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using mass spectrometry to identify proteins that coimmunoprecipitated
with maspardin (ACP33; 608181) from HeLa cell lysates, followed by
database analysis, Hanna and Blackstone (2009) identified ALDH16A1.
Immunohistochemical analysis detected a punctate cytoplasmic ALDH16A1
distribution in HeLa cells. Western blot analysis showed that the
protein had an apparent molecular mass of 85 kD. RT-PCR detected
Aldh16a1 in mouse brain. In situ hybridization of cultured mouse
cortical neurons revealed prominent punctate Aldh16a1 staining in cell
bodies and growth cones.

GENE FUNCTION

Using coimmunoprecipitation analysis and protein pull-down assays, Hanna
and Blackstone (2009) showed that endogenous maspardin and ALDH16A1
interacted directly.

MAPPING

Hartz (2010) mapped the ALDH16A1 gene to chromosome 19q13.33 based on an
alignment of the ALDH16A1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AY007096) with the

Hox-1.3, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION For background information on homeobox genes, see 142950.

GENE FUNCTION

Raman et al. (2000) showed that transfected HOXA5 upregulates both p53
(191170) promoter-reporter constructs and endogenous p53 synthesis,
leading to apoptosis. HOXA5 was detectable in only one-third of the
primary tumors, but in most of the remaining tumors, lack of HOXA5
expression strongly correlated with methylation of its promoter region,
suggesting a causal role for methylation in the silencing of HOXA5 gene
expression. These results suggested that HOXA5 expression is an
important step in tumorigenesis. Raman et al. (2000) concluded that loss
of expression of p53 in human breast cancer may be primarily due to lack
of expression of HOXA5.

Raman et al. (2000) investigated the possibility that the progesterone
receptor (PGR; 607311) could be a target of HOXA5 action. Sequence
analysis of PGR identified 7 putative upstream HOX-binding sites.
Cotransfection of a PGR+/ESR1+ (133430) or a PGR-/ESR1- breast cancer
cell line with HOXA5, but not with HOXB5 (142960) or HOXB7 (142962),
resulted in a 60-fold increase in PGR expression. Cotransfection with
HOXB4 (142965), an upstream effector of HOXA5, enhanced expression up to
10-fold only in the receptor-negative cell line. Stepwise promoter
analysis suggested that HOXA5 binds to a site at the 3-prime end of the
PGR promoter region. Western blot analysis demonstrated that HOXA5
upregulates the expression of the 116-kD PGRB isoform in breast cancer
cell lines. Raman et al. (2000) proposed that the loss of HOXA5 in
breast cancer might influence the expression of key genes important for
normal differentiation.

Stasinopoulos et al. (2005) found that HOXA5 bound to the antiapoptotic
protein TWIST (601622). Using a p53 promoter reporter system in a human
TWIST-expressing breast carcinoma cell line, they found that TWIST
suppressed p53 target sequences and that HOXA5 coexpression largely
reversed this suppression.

Chen and Gorski (2008) identified an miR130A (MIRN130A; 610175) target
site in the 3-prime UTR of the HOXA5 gene and showed that miR130A
inhibited HOXA5 expression and antiangiogenic activity in human
umbilical vein endothelial cells.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the HOXA5
gene to chromosome 7 (TMAP SGC33676).

300011	TITLE *300011 ATPase, Cu(2+)-TRANSPORTING, ALPHA POLYPEPTIDE; ATP7A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ATP7A gene encodes a transmembrane copper-transporting P-type ATPase
(summary by Vulpe et al., 1993).

CLONING

The ATP7A gene was cloned as a candidate for the site of mutations
causing Menkes disease (MNK; 309400) by 3 independent groups (Vulpe et
al., 1993; Chelly et al., 1993; Mercer et al., 1993). By a database
search of the predicted sequence, Vulpe et al. (1993) found strong
homology to P-type ATPases, a family of integral membrane proteins that
use an aspartylphosphate intermediate to transport cations across
membranes. The 1,500-residue protein was found to have the
characteristics of a copper-binding protein. It has 6 N-terminal copper
binding sites and a catalytic transduction core with several functional
domains. Northern blot analysis showed that the mRNA of the gene, which
was symbolized 'MNK' before its precise nature was known, is present in
a variety of cell types and tissues, except liver, in which expression
is reduced or absent. The findings were consistent with the clinical
observation that the liver is largely unaffected in Menkes disease and
fails to accumulate excess copper.

Levinson et al. (1994) and Mercer et al. (1994) isolated the mouse
homolog of the Menkes disease gene. The mouse protein shows 89% identity
to the human protein, and both proteins contain 8 transmembrane domains.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tumer et al. (1995) determined that the ATP7A gene spans about 150 kb of
genomic DNA and contains 23 exons. The ATG start codon is in the second
exon. The ATP7A and ATP7B (606882) genes showed strikingly similar
exonic structures, with almost identical structures starting from the
fifth metal-binding domain, suggesting the presence of a common ancestor
encoding 1, and possibly 2, metal-binding domains in addition to the
ATPase 'core.'

Dierick et al. (1995) showed that the ATP7A gene contains 23 exons
distributed over approximately 140 kb of genomic DNA. The authors showed
that exon 10 is alternatively spliced. They found that the structures of
the ATP7A and ATP7B genes are similar in the 3-prime two-thirds region,
consistent with their common evolutionary ancestry.

GENE FUNCTION

Kuo et al. (1997) determined the gene expression patterns during mouse
embryonic development for the Atp7a and Atp7b genes by RNA in situ
hybridization. Atp7a expression was widespread throughout development
whereas Atp7b expression was more delimited. Kuo et al. (1997) suggested
that Atp7a functions primarily in the homeostatic maintenance of cell
copper levels, whereas Atp7b may be involved specifically in the
biosynthesis of distinct cuproproteins in different tissues.

Studies in cultured cells localized the MNK protein to the final
compartment of the Golgi apparatus, the trans-Golgi network (TGN). At
this location, MNK is predicted to supply copper to the copper-dependent
enzymes as they migrate through the secretory pathway. However, under
conditions of elevated extracellular copper, the MNK protein undergoes a
rapid relocalization to the plasma membrane where it functions in the
efflux of copper from cells. By in vitro mutagenesis of the human ATP7A
cDNA and immunofluorescence detection of mutant forms of the MNK protein
expressed in cultured cells, Petris et al. (1998) demonstrated that the
dileucine, L1487L1488, was essential for localization of MNK within the
TGN, but not for copper efflux. They suggested that this dileucine motif
is a putative endocytic targeting motif necessary for the retrieval of
MNK from the plasma membrane to the TGN. Qian et al. (1998) and Francis
et al. (1998) demonstrated that the third transmembrane region of the
MNK protein functions as a TGN targeting signal; Petris et al. (1998)
suggested that MNK localization to the TGN may be a 2-step process
involving TGN retention by the transmembrane region, and recycling to
this compartment from the plasma membrane via the L1487L1488 motif.

Petris et al. (2000) investigated whether the ATP7A protein is required
for the activity of tyrosinase (606933), a copper-dependent enzyme
involved in melanogenesis that is synthesized within the secretory
pathway. Recombinant tyrosinase expressed in immortalized Menkes
fibroblast cell lines was inactive, whereas in normal fibroblasts known
to express ATP7A there was substantial tyrosinase activity. Coexpression
of ATP7A and tyrosinase from plasmid constructs in Menkes fibroblasts
led to the activation of tyrosinase and melanogenesis. This
ATP7A-dependent activation of tyrosinase was impaired by the chelation
of copper in the medium of cells and after mutation of the invariant
phosphorylation site at aspartic acid residue 1044 of ATP7A. The authors
proposed that ATP7A transports copper into the secretory pathway of
mammalian cells to activate copper-dependent enzymes.

Cobbold et al. (2002) showed that endogenous ATP7A in cultured cell
lines was localized to the distal Golgi apparatus and translocated to
the plasma membrane in response to exogenous copper ions. This transport
event was not blocked by expression of a dominant-negative mutant
protein kinase D (PRKCM; 605435), an enzyme implicated in regulating
constitutive trafficking from the TGN to the plasma membrane, whereas
constitutive transport of CD4 (186940) was inhibited. In contrast,
protein kinase A inhibitors blocked copper-stimulated ATP7A delivery to
the plasma membrane. Expression of constitutively active Rho GTPases
such as CDC42 (116952), RAC1 (602048), and RhoA (ARHA; 165390) revealed
a requirement for CDC42 in the trafficking of ATP7A to the cell surface.
Furthermore, overexpression of WASP (300392) inhibited anterograde
transport of ATP7A, further supporting regulation by the CDC42 GTPase.

Cobbold et al. (2003) showed that ATP7A is internalized by a novel
pathway that is independent of clathrin (see 118960)-mediated
endocytosis. Expression of dominant-negative mutants of the dynamin-1
(DNM1; 602377), dynamin-2 (DNM2; 602378), and EPS15 (600051) proteins
that block clathrin-dependent endocytosis of the transferrin receptor
did not inhibit internalization of endogenous ATP7A or an ATP7A reporter
molecule (CD8-MCF1). Similarly, inhibitors of caveolae (see
601047)-mediated uptake did not affect ATP7A internalization and
prevented uptake of BODIPY-ganglioside GM1, a caveolae marker. In
contrast, expression of a constitutively active mutant of the RAC1
GTPase inhibited plasma membrane internalization of both the ATP7A and
transferrin receptor transmembrane proteins. Cobbold et al. (2003)
concluded that their findings defined a novel route required for ATP7A
internalization and delivery to endosomes.

Schlief et al. (2006) stated that ATP7A is required for production of an
NMDA receptor (see GRIN1; 138249)-dependent releasable copper pool
within hippocampal neurons, suggesting a role for copper in
activity-dependent modulation of synaptic activity. In support of this
hypothesis, they found that copper chelation exacerbated NMDA-mediated
excitotoxic cell death in rat primary hippocampal neurons, whereas
addition of copper was protective and significantly decreased
cytoplasmic calcium levels after NMDA receptor activation. The
protective effect of copper in hippocampal neurons depended on
endogenous nitric oxide production, demonstrating an in vivo link
between neuroprotection, copper metabolism, and nitrosylation. Using
'brindled' mice, a model of Menkes disease (see ANIMAL MODEL), Schlief
et al. (2006) showed that ATP7A was required for these copper-dependent
effects. Hippocampal neurons isolated from newborn brindled mice showed
marked sensitivity to endogenous glutamate-mediated NMDA
receptor-dependent excitotoxicity in vitro, and mild hypoxic/ischemic
insult to these mice in vivo resulted in significantly increased
caspase-3 (CASP3; 600636) activation and neuronal injury.

Setty et al. (2008) showed that the pigment cell-specific cuproenzyme
tyrosinase acquires copper only transiently and inefficiently within the
trans-Golgi network of mouse melanocytes. To catalyze melanin synthesis,
tyrosinase is subsequently reloaded with copper within specialized
organelles called melanosomes. Copper is supplied to melanosomes by
ATP7A, a cohort of which localizes to melanosomes in a BLOC1 (biogenesis
of lysosome-related organelles complex-1)-dependent manner. Setty et al.
(2008) concluded that cell type-specific localization of a metal
transporter is required to sustain metallation of an endomembrane
cuproenzyme, providing a mechanism for exquisite spatial control of
metalloenzyme activity. Moreover, because BLOC1 subunits are mutated in
subtypes of the genetic disease Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (203300),
these results also show that defects in copper transporter localization
contribute to hypopigmentation, and hence perhaps other synaptic
defects, in Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Gourdon et al. (2011) presented the structure of a P-type class IB (PIB)
ATPase, a Legionella pneumophila CopA copper ATPase, in a copper-free
form, as determined by x-ray crystallography at 3.2-angstrom resolution.
The structure indicates a 3-stage copper transport pathway involving
several conserved residues. A PIB-specific transmembrane helix kinks at
a double-glycine motif displaying an amphipathic helix that lines a
putative copper entry point at the intracellular interface. Comparisons
to calcium ATPase suggested an ATPase-coupled copper release mechanism
from the binding sites in the membrane via an extracellular exit site.
Gourdon et al. (2011) suggested that their structure will provide a
framework for analysis of missense mutations in human ATP7A and ATP7B
(606882) proteins associated with Menkes and Wilson disease (277900),
respectively.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Menkes Disease

Kaler et al. (1994) identified mutations in the ATP7A gene in affected
members of a family with Menkes disease (300011.0001).

Tumer et al. (1997) examined genomic DNA of 41 unrelated patients
affected with the classic severe form of Menkes disease. Using SSCP
analysis and direct sequencing of the exons amplified by PCR, they
identified a different mutation in each of the 41 patients, including 19
insertion/deletions, 10 nonsense mutations, 4 missense mutations, and 8
splice site alterations. Approximately 90% of the mutations were
predicted to result in truncation of the ATP7A protein. In 20 patients
the mutations were within exons 7-10, and half of these mutations
affected exon 8. Furthermore, 5 alterations were observed within the
6-bp sequence at the splice donor site of intron 8, which would be
predicted to affect the efficiency of exon 8 splicing. Tumer et al.
(1997) speculated that the region encoded by exon 8 may serve as a
'stalk,' joining its metal-binding domains and its ATPase core.

Poulsen et al. (2002) stated that approximately 15% of mutations causing
Menkes disease are partial gene deletions. Poulsen et al. (2002)
demonstrated that intragenic polymorphic markers can be used for carrier
detection as well as for the identification of affected males.

Moller et al. (2005) identified 21 novel missense mutations in the ATP7A
gene in patients with Menkes disease. The mutations were located within
the conserved part of ATP7A between residues val842 and ser1404.
Molecular 3-dimensional modeling based on the structure of ATP2A1
(108730) showed that the mutations were more spatially clustered than
expected from the primary sequence. The authors suggested that some of
the mutations may interfere with copper binding.

Moizard et al. (2011) identified pathogenic mutations in the ATP7A gene
in 34 (85%) of 40 patients referred for either Menkes disease (n = 38)
or OHS (n = 2). There were 23 point mutations, including 9 missense
mutations, 7 splice site variants, 4 nonsense mutations, and 3 small
insertions or deletions, as well as 7 intragenic deletions. Twenty-one
of the mutations were novel, indicating that most mutations are private.
In addition, there were 4 whole exon duplications, which expanded the
mutational spectrum in the ATP7A gene. Large rearrangements, either
deletions or duplications, accounted for 32.4% of the mutations. Most
(66.6%) of the point mutations resulted in impaired ATP7A transcript
splicing.

- Occipital Horn Syndrome

Kaler et al. (1994) identified mutations in the ATP7A gene in a patient
with X-linked cutis laxa, also known as occipital horn syndrome (OHS;
304150) (see 300011.0002).

Levinson et al. (1996) detected a small deletion in a region 5-prime to
the MNK gene in a patient with occipital horn syndrome. Whereas a normal
control had 3 tandem 98-bp repeats upstream of the transcription start
site, the patient had a deletion of 1 of the repeats. Although cell
lines from the patient showed no reduction in MNK mRNA, there was a
decrease in activity of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT)
reporter gene, suggesting that the repeat sequences may regulate MNK
gene expression in the context of a larger region of genomic DNA.
Levinson et al. (1996) speculated that their studies of MNK mRNA levels
in the patient's cultured cells did not accurately reflect the in vivo
situation. The deletion was not identified in 110 control individuals.

- X-Linked Distal Spinal Muscular Atrophy 3

In affected members of 2 families with X-linked distal spinal muscular
atrophy-3 (SMAX3; 300489), previously reported by Takata et al. (2004)
and Kennerson et al. (2009), Kennerson et al. (2010) identified 2
different mutations in the ATP7A gene: T994I (300011.0015) and P1386S
(300011.0016), respectively. In vitro functional expression assays
indicated that the mutations resulted in impaired copper transport into
the secretory pathway for incorporation into nascent proproteins,
perhaps due to reduced conformational flexibility. Kennerson et al.
(2010) suggested that the late onset of distal muscular atrophy implies
that these mutations produced attenuated effects that required years to
provoke pathologic consequences. Motor neurons may be particularly
sensitive to perturbations in copper homeostasis or copper deficiency,
which may impair normal axonal growth and synaptogenesis.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

The clinical outcome of copper replacement therapy in Menkes disease in
the small number of cases reported has ranged from poor (Kaler et al.,
1995) to favorable (Christodoulou et al., 1998). Kim et al. (2003)
characterized the biochemical and cell biologic defect associated with
an MNK mutation (300011.0010) found in a successfully treated patient
(Kaler et al., 1996). The mutation involved the deletion of exon 8 of
the ATP7A gene, which encodes a small region between the sixth copper
binding site and the first membrane spanning domain of the MNK protein.
The mutant protein localized correctly to the TGN and was capable of
transporting copper to tyrosinase, a copper-dependent enzyme that is
synthesized within secretory compartments. However, in cells exposed to
increased copper, the MNK mutant protein failed to traffic to the plasma
membrane. This represented the first trafficking defective Menkes
disease mutation demonstrated to retain copper transport function,
thereby showing that trafficking and transport functions of MNK ATPase
can be uncoupled. Thus, certain Menkes disease mutations that inhibit
copper-induced trafficking of an otherwise functional copper transporter
may be particularly responsive to copper replacement therapy.

Moller et al. (2000) stated that more than 150 point mutations had been
identified in the ATP7A gene. Most of these mutations were found to lead
to the classic form of Menkes disease, and a few to the milder occipital
horn syndrome. They reported 2 Menkes patients and 1 OHS patient with
mutations in the splice donor site of intron 6. RT-PCR studies showed
that exon 6 was deleted in most ATP7A transcripts of all 3 patients, but
RT-PCR amplification with an exon 6-specific primer identified small
amounts of exon 6-containing mRNA products from all 3 patients. Direct
sequencing showed that only the patient with OHS had correctly spliced
exon 6-containing transcripts at levels of 2 to 5% of controls. These
findings indicated that the presence of barely detectable amounts of
correctly spliced ATP7A transcript is sufficient to permit the
development of the milder OHS phenotype, as opposed to classic Menkes
disease. The patient with OHS was found to have a mutation at a less
conserved position of the donor splice site (300011.0006) compared to 1
of the Menkes patients who had a mutation at a more conserved position
of the splice site (300011.0007).

Gu et al. (2001) searched for mutations in the ATP7A gene in 17
unrelated Japanese males with Menkes disease and 2 Japanese males with
occipital horn syndrome. In 16 of 17 males with Menkes disease, they
identified 16 mutations, including 4 deletions, 2 insertions, 6 nonsense
mutations, 2 missense mutations, and 2 splice site mutations. Of 2 males
with occipital horn syndrome, 1 had a splice site mutation in intron 6
that led to normal-size and smaller-size transcripts. The amount of the
normal-size transcripts in his cultured skin fibroblasts was 19% of the
normal level. Serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels were normal, whereas
his cultured skin fibroblasts contained increased levels of copper. This
patient, first seen at the age of 12 months, had developmental delay,
hypotonia, and cutis laxa. Bladder diverticula were detected at age 21
months, and occipital horns at age 6 years.

ANIMAL MODEL

The 'mottled' (Mo) mouse comprises several phenotypic variations
presumed to result from a single X-linked locus. Hemizygous 'pewter'
(pew) males have isolated coat color changes; 'blotchy' (blo) males have
connective tissue defects; 'brindled' (br) and 'macular' (ml) mice have
neurologic disease; and 'dappled' (dp) and 'tortoiseshell' (to) mice
have perinatal lethality. For a detailed description of the 'mottled'
mouse, a model for Menkes syndrome, see 309400. Levinson et al. (1994)
and Mercer et al. (1994) found that 2 variant forms of the mottled
mouse, dappled and blotchy, resulted from allelic mutations at the
mottled locus. The dappled mutant had no Atp7a mRNA, resulting from a
deletion or rearrangement of DNA in the Atp7a gene, and the blotchy
mouse mutant had abnormal mRNA expression, likely resulting from a
splice site mutation.

Reed and Boyd (1997) identified mutations in the Atp7a gene in the
'viable brindled' (vbr) and 'brindled' mottled mouse mutants. Cecchi et
al. (1997) identified mutations in mouse Atp7a that could explain the
mottled phenotype in 9 of 10 mutants analyzed. The authors commented
that the wide spectrum of mutations detected in the mouse Atp7a gene
provided an explanation for at least part of the wide phenotypic
variation observed in mottled mutant mice.

Grimes et al. (1997) showed that the 'brindled' mouse has a deletion of
2 amino acids in a highly conserved region of the Atp7a gene. They also
presented Western blot data for the normal gene product in tissues. In
the kidney, immunohistochemistry demonstrated the protein in proximal
and distal tubules, with a distribution identical in mutant and normal
mice. This distribution was considered consistent with the protein being
involved in copper resorption from the urine.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MENKES DISEASE, MILD
ATP7A, IVSXDS, A-T, +3

Family A, studied by Kaler et al. (1994), had 4 males with a Menkes
disease (309400) phenotype featuring comparatively enhanced longevity
and milder neurodevelopmental deficits compared with classic Menkes
disease. All 4 affected males were still living at ages 36, 26, 16, and
2 years. The 3 oldest had onset of seizures at ages 4, 8, and 3 years of
age, respectively. All 4 had pili torti, bladder diverticula, and
striking skin laxity. The 3 oldest had occipital exostoses and chronic
diarrhea. In family A, the affected males were found to have a mutation
in a splice donor site leading to deletion of 118 nucleotides
constituting so-called exon X. An A-to-T transversion at the +3 position
resulted in 3 consecutive thymine bases in this splice donor site.
Because the mutation did not alter a restriction site in the gene, Kaler
et al. (1994) developed a PCR-based assay to screen members of the
family for the mutation, using the amplification refractory mutation
system (ARMS).

.0002
OCCIPITAL HORN SYNDROME
ATP7A, IVSAS, 2642A-G, -2

In a 15-year-old male whose clinical and radiographic abnormalities
corresponded closely to those compiled in 20 patients with occipital
horn syndrome (304150) by Tsukahara et al. (1994), Kaler et al. (1994)
identified a 2462A-G transition at the 3-prime end (position -2) of a
92-bp exon in the ATP7A gene, resulting in exon skipping and activation
of a cryptic splice acceptor site. Maintenance of some normal splicing
was demonstrable by RT-PCR, cDNA sequencing, and ribonuclease
protection.

.0003
OCCIPITAL HORN SYNDROME
ATP7A, SER637LEU

Ronce et al. (1997) observed a family in which 6 males in 5 sibships in
3 generations connected through carrier females who had occipital horn
syndrome (304150). Studies of the proband's DNA revealed a 2055C-T
transition in exon 8 of the ATP7A gene, resulting in a ser637-to-leu
(S637L) substitution. This transition was associated with both normal
processing of ATP7A mRNA and exon skipping, with 2 alternatively spliced
abnormal products: 1 with only exon 8 skipped and the other with 3
consecutive exons--8, 9, and 10--skipped. Ronce et al. (1997) noted that
exon 8, the site of this mutation, appears to be particularly vulnerable
to mutations, and referred to a nonsense mutation in the same codon,
S637X, that had been reported by Tumer et al. (1997). The fact that the
OHS phenotype but not the Menkes (309400) phenotype was observed in this
patient could be explained by the presence of the normally processed
mRNA and by the likely production of functional ATP7A protein.

The patient reported by Ronce et al. (1997) was suggested to have
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome within the first week of birth because of the
combination of long length, pectus excavatum, loose skin, and joint
laxity. Right and left inguinal hernias were observed from 4 months of
age and required repeated surgical interventions. Recurrent urinary
bacterial infections revealed bladder diverticula at 15 months of age.
Skin biopsies at 5 years of age revealed fragmented collagen fibers and
a relative excess of elastic fibers. Normally elevated radiocopper
retention was demonstrated in the patient's fibroblasts. At the age of
25 years, the man was tall (181.5 cm), with narrow shoulders, marked
pectus excavatum, and dorsal kyphosis, flat feet, loose wrists and
finger joints, a weak abdominal wall, soft pinnae, and loose and
hyperelastic skin. The hair was kinky, with numerous, although moderate,
pili torti. All of the teeth had gray enamel, and the inferior incisors
had particular spicules. Skeletal x-rays showed mild occipital
exostoses, thickening of muscle insertion zones on the long bones, and
irregular shapes of the cubitus and radius, with distortion of the
proximal end of the radius and enlargement of the distal end of the
tibia. The proband died suddenly at 27 years of age; autopsy showed
perforated gastric ulcer and peritonitis. His mother had a long face,
large pinnae, and loose skin, which could be interpreted as symptoms of
the carrier state.

.0004
OCCIPITAL HORN SYNDROME
ATP7A, 8-BP DEL, NT1552

In a Mexican-American male infant who presented as a neonate with severe
congenital cutis laxa (304150), Packman et al. (1997) identified an 8-bp
deletion (1552del8) in exon 5 of the ATP7A gene, which encodes the fifth
metal-binding domain. The out-of-frame deletion resulted in a downstream
premature stop codon. At birth, the child had extremely loose skin, with
truncal folds and sagging facial skin, hyperextensible joints, pectus
excavatum, craniotabes, and stridor. His hair was sparse and coarse,
with frontal balding. Significant neurologic abnormalities were first
noted at age 2 months, after which time he showed progressive neurologic
deterioration until death at age 13 months. MRI at age 2.5 weeks showed
tortuosity and looping of intracranial vessels. Skin biopsy at that time
showed fragmented elastin fibers. Serum copper was normal on day 1, but
low at age 4 months.

.0005
MENKES DISEASE
ATP7A, ARG980TER

In a patient with lethal neonatal Menkes disease (309400) reported by
Jankov et al. (1998), Horn (1999) identified a C-to-T transition in the
ATP7A gene, resulting in an arg980-to-ter (R980X) substitution. The
child presented as a newborn with acute onset of severe intraabdominal
bleeding, hemorrhagic shock, and multiple fractures leading to death at
day 27. Menkes disease was diagnosed at autopsy and confirmed by copper
accumulation studies on cultured fibroblasts. Such an early onset of
fatal complications in Menkes disease had not previously been reported.
The R980X mutation was said to have been identical to the mutation found
in an unrelated male with Menkes disease who died at the age of 4 years
without severe connective tissue disease (Horn, 1999).

.0006
OCCIPITAL HORN SYNDROME
ATP7A, IVS6DS, T-A, +6

In a 24-year-old man with a clinical picture typical of occipital horn
syndrome (304150), Moller et al. (2000) identified a T-to-A transversion
at the donor splice site of intron 6 of the ATP7A gene. Cell culture
studies showed levels of ATP7A transcripts at 2 to 5% of controls. The
patient had a narrow thorax, joint deformities, right inguinal hernia,
bladder diverticula, vascular abnormalities, and chronic diarrhea.
Occipital horns of about 5 cm had been found when he was 18. The
patient's skin was dry, loose, and hypopigmented, and his hair was
coarse. Complications included aneurysms of abdominal vessels, hepatic
artery, and splenic artery which were treated surgically. The patient
showed psychomotor retardation, with psychotic characteristics
(manic-depressive behavior). He was able to walk without support at age
3 years and started talking at age 3.5 years. Serum copper and
ceruloplasmin levels were significantly below normal.
Copper-incorporation studies showed abnormal accumulation and retention,
confirming that the patient suffered from a variant of Menkes disease. A
brother who had similar connective tissue abnormalities and coarse hair,
but was more severely retarded, had died at age 8 years (Mentzel et al.,
1999).

.0007
MENKES DISEASE
ATP7A, IVS6DS, G-A, +1

Moller et al. (2000) described a splice site mutation involving the +1
position of intron 6 of the ATP7A gene in a patient with classic Menkes
disease (309400). The patient had shown hypoglycemia and repeated
episodes of hypothermia during the neonatal period. At the age of 8
weeks, he was hospitalized because of feeding difficulties that were
accompanied by therapy-resistant seizures. At 10 weeks of age, his hair
started to fall out and was replaced by hair with an abnormal texture,
raising suspicion of Menkes disease. Serum copper and ceruloplasmin
levels were very low. Over the next months he developed subdural
hematomas, high arched palate, and wormian bones in the lambdoid suture
of the occipital region. Bladder diverticula were diagnosed at age 1.5
years. Copper histidine therapy was initiated when he was 8 months old
and continued until his death at age 21 years.

.0008
OCCIPITAL HORN SYNDROME
ATP7A, 1-BP DEL, 4497G

In affected members of a family with occipital horn syndrome (304150),
Dagenais et al. (2001) identified a 1-bp deletion (4497delG) in exon 23
of the ATP7A gene, resulting in a frameshift at codon 1451 and premature
termination of the protein. Although abundant levels of mutant
transcript were present, there were substantially reduced levels of the
truncated protein, which lacked the key dileucine motif L1487L1488. This
dileucine motif functions as an endocytic signal for ATP7A cycling
between the trans-Golgi network and the plasma membrane. Steady-state
localization of ATP7A to the trans-Golgi network is necessary for proper
activity of lysyl oxidase (153455), which is the predominant cuproenzyme
whose activity is deficient in OHS and which is essential for
maintenance of connective-tissue integrity. The proband in the family
reported by Dagenais et al. (2001) sat without assistance at the age of
7 months and was able to crawl at the age of 7.5 months. On examination,
he exhibited multiple bladder diverticula, renal calculus,
vesicoureteral reflux, bilateral inguinal hernia repair, neurogenic
bladder, genu valgum, and pectus excavatum. He also had mildly
hyperelastic skin, especially over the abdomen, and required special
education. Skeletal survey showed bilateral occipital horns, mild
lower-thoracic and lumbar platyspondyly, marked pectus excavatum, broad
scapular necks, clavicular handlebar/hammer contour, humeral and femoral
diaphyseal wavy contour, bilateral coxa valga, and minimal dextroconvex
scoliosis. He had an affected brother, a maternal uncle, and a cousin
with slight variability in severity.

.0009
MENKES DISEASE
ATP7A, GLY1019ASP

In transfected cultured cells, Kim et al. (2002) characterized a
gly1019-to-asp (G1019D) mutation, located in the large cytoplasmic loop
of the MNK protein, that causes Menkes disease (309400). In
copper-limiting conditions, the G1019D mutant protein was retained in
the endoplasmic reticulum. This mislocalization was corrected by the
addition of copper to cells via a process that was dependent upon the
copper-binding sites at the N-terminal region of the MNK protein.
Reduced growth temperature and the chemical chaperone glycerol corrected
the mislocalization of the G1019D mutant, suggesting that this mutation
interferes with protein folding in the secretory pathway. These findings
identified G1019D as the first conditional mutation associated with
Menkes disease and demonstrated correction of the mislocalized protein
by copper supplementation. The findings provided a molecular framework
for understanding how mutations that affect the proper folding of the
MNK transporter in Menkes patients may be responsive to parenteral
copper therapy.

.0010
MENKES DISEASE, COPPER-REPLACEMENT RESPONSIVE
ATP7A, EX8 DEL

Kaler et al. (1996) described successful early copper therapy in Menkes
disease (309400) associated with a mutant transcript containing a small
in-frame deletion. This splice site mutation resulted in deletion of
exon 8, which encodes a small region between the sixth copper binding
site and the first membrane-spanning domain of MNK protein. Kim et al.
(2003) demonstrated that the mutant protein was defective in
copper-induced trafficking but its copper transport mutant function was
retained. The sequence of exon 8 was deleted from the mutant protein
extended between serine-624 and glutamine-649 that was deleted in the
in-frame transcript of the patient and replaced by 624 ile-arg.

.0011
MENKES DISEASE
ATP7A, 8-BP DEL, NT408

In a child with classic Menkes disease (309400) and an unusual finding
of early occipital horns, Gerard-Blanluet et al. (2004) identified an
8-bp deletion (408delCAATCAGA) in the ATP7A gene, resulting in a
frameshift starting at amino acid 136, addition of 21 aberrant amino
acids, and loss of the 1,363 amino acids of the C-terminal sequence.
They presented hypotheses concerning the occurrence of the rare feature
of occipital horn.

.0012
MENKES DISEASE
ATP7A, EX3-4 DEL

Tumer et al. (2003) reported 2 patients with Menkes disease (309400)
with unexpectedly mild symptoms and long survival. The proband was 27
years old and his affected maternal cousin 24 years at the time of the
report. The proband showed developmental delay at age 6 months and at
age 2 years began having seizures. At age 4 years, he developed head
control, and, at age 9 years, his motor and mental status was assumed to
be like that of a 3-month-old child. At age 17 years, he had no speech,
was hypotonic, and had brown, coarse hair. Both the proband and his
cousin with the same less-severe symptoms had a deletion in the ATP7A
gene encompassing exons 3 and 4.

Paulsen et al. (2006) investigated the functional effect of the large
frameshift deletion in ATP7A including exons 3 and 4 identified in a
patient with Menkes disease with unexpectedly mild symptoms and long
survival (Tumer et al., 2003). The mutated transcript contained a
premature termination codon after 46 codons. Although such transcripts
are generally degraded by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), it was
established by real-time PCR quantification that the transcript in this
instance was protected from degradation. A combination of in vitro
translation, recombinant expression, and immunocytochemical analysis
provided evidence that the mutant transcript was protected from
degradation because of reinitiation of protein translation. The findings
suggested that reinitiation takes place at 2 downstream internal codons.
The putative N terminally truncated proteins contained only
copper-binding site 5 (CBS5) and CBS6. Cellular localization and
copper-dependent trafficking of the major part of endogenous and
recombinant ATP7 mutant proteins were similar to the wildtype ATP7A
protein. Furthermore, the mutant cDNA was able to rescue a yeast strain
lacking the homologous gene, CCC2. In summary, Paulsen et al. (2006)
proposed that reinitiation of the NMD-resistant mutant transcript leads
to the synthesis of N terminally truncated and at least partially
functional Menkes proteins missing CBS1 through CBS4. Thus a mutation
that would have been assumed to be null is not.

.0013
OCCIPITAL HORN SYNDROME
ATP7A, ASN1304SER

In 2 brothers with occipital horn syndrome (304150) and their carrier
mother, Tang et al. (2006) identified an A-to-G transition at nucleotide
4056 in exon 20 of the ATP7A gene, resulting in an asparagine-to-serine
substitution at codon 1304 (N1304S). This mutation was not identified in
50 normal control chromosomes. Tang et al. (2006) showed evidence of 33%
residual copper transport by the N1304S mutant allele in a yeast
complementation assay.

.0014
MENKES DISEASE
ATP7A, ARG201TER

In a boy with Menkes disease (309400) and unusually favorable response
to early copper treatment, Kaler et al. (2009) identified a 746C-T
transition in exon 3 of the ATP7A gene, resulting in an arg201-to-ter
(R201X) substitution. Western blot analysis of patient fibroblasts
showed small amounts of the full-length 178-kD protein. In vitro studies
in yeast showed that the mutant protein retained functional copper
transport activity. Overall, the findings indicated a read-through of
the stop codon. Comparison with other yeast genes that show such
read-through mechanisms suggested that unique 5-prime sequences have a
role in nonsense suppression, and that mRNA structure may modulate
competition between eukaryotic release factors and suppressor tRNA. The
findings were consistent with the dramatic clinical response to
treatment in this patient, who was neurologically normal at age 11.5
years.

.0015
SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY, DISTAL, X-LINKED 3
ATP7A, THR994ILE

In 10 affected males from a large Brazilian family with X-linked distal
spinal muscular atrophy-3 (SMAX3; 300489), Kennerson et al. (2010)
identified a hemizygous 2981C-T transition in exon 15 of the ATP7A gene,
resulting in a thr994-to-ile (T994I) substitution in a highly conserved
residue in the C terminus of the protein that did not disrupt critical
functional domains. The mutation was not found in 800 ethnically matched
controls. The family had previously been reported by Takata et al.
(2004). Immunocytochemical studies showed that the T994I-mutant protein
had impaired intracellular trafficking compared to control, with some of
the mutant protein remaining in the Golgi apparatus after exposure to
copper. The findings suggested that the mutation resulted in impaired
copper transport into the secretory pathway for incorporation into
nascent proproteins, perhaps due to reduced conformational flexibility.
Kennerson et al. (2010) suggested that the late onset of distal muscular
atrophy implies that the T994I mutation produced attenuated effects that
required years to provoke pathologic consequences. Motor neurons may be
particularly sensitive to perturbations in copper homeostasis or copper
deficiency, which may impair normal axonal growth and synaptogenesis.

.0016
SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY, DISTAL, X-LINKED 3
ATP7A, PRO1386SER

In 9 affected males from a large North American family with X-linked
distal spinal muscular atrophy-3 (SMAX3; 300489), previously reported by
Kennerson et al. (2009), Kennerson et al. (2010) identified a hemizygous
4156C-T transition in exon 22 of the ATP7A gene, resulting in a
pro1386-to-ser (P1386S) substitution in a highly conserved residue in
the C terminus. The mutation was not found in 800 ethnically matched
controls. Immunocytochemical analyses showed that the P1386S-mutant
protein demonstrated impaired intracellular trafficking compared to
control, with some mutant protein remaining in the Golgi apparatus after
exposure to copper. Cultured fibroblasts carrying the P1386S mutation
had steady-state copper levels that were intermediate between normal
control and classic Menkes disease (309400). The growth of yeast
transformed with the P1386S allele was less than that of wildtype at all
temperatures. The findings suggested that the mutation resulted in
impaired copper transport into the secretory pathway for incorporation
into nascent proproteins, perhaps due to reduced conformational
flexibility. Kennerson et al. (2010) suggested that the late onset of
distal muscular atrophy implies that the P1386S mutation produced
attenuated effects that required years to provoke pathologic
consequences. Motor neurons may be particularly sensitive to
perturbations in copper homeostasis or copper deficiency, which may
impair normal axonal growth and synaptogenesis.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Chromosomal segregation during mitosis as well as meiosis is regulated
by kinases and phosphatases. The Aurora kinases associate with
microtubules during chromosome movement and segregation. Aurora kinase B
localizes to microtubules near kinetochores, specifically to the
specialized microtubules called K-fibers, and Aurora kinase A (603072)
localizes to centrosomes (Lampson et al., 2004).

CLONING

The Drosophila 'aurora' and S. cerevisiae Ipl1 serine/threonine protein
kinases (STKs) are involved in mitotic events such as centrosome
separation and chromosome segregation. Using a degenerate primer-based
PCR method to screen for novel STKs, Shindo et al. (1998) isolated mouse
and human cDNAs encoding STK12, which they termed ARK2 (aurora-related
kinase-2). Sequence analysis of human STK12 predicted a 344-amino acid
protein containing kinase domains that share high homology with the
catalytic domains of other STKs. Cell cycle and Northern blot analyses
showed that STK12 is expressed in the S phase and persistently
thereafter. Western blot analysis indicated that STK12 is localized in
the midbodies during anaphase.

By searching sequence databases for clones homologous to AIK (AURKA;
603072), Kimura et al. (1998) obtained a cDNA encoding STK12, which they
designated AIK2 (aurora/Ip11-like kinase-2). Northern blot analysis
detected strong expression of a 1.5-kb STK12 transcript in thymus, with
weaker expression in small intestine, testis, colon, spleen, and brain.
Western blot analysis demonstrated expression of a 39-kD STK12 protein.

By screening a HeLa cell cDNA library with a rat Aim1 (aurora- and
Ipl1-like midbody-associated protein) probe, Katayama et al. (1998)
isolated a cDNA encoding STK12. A kinase-negative STK12 mutant was shown
to induce a failure in cytokinesis during mitosis. The authors found
that during differentiation of megakaryocytes, there is no cytokinesis
and reduced expression of STK12. Tatsuka et al. (1998) found that STK12
is highly expressed as a 1.2-kb transcript in transformed cell lines but
not in normal fibroblasts. They also showed that STK12 is associated
with multinuclearity and polyploidy.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged proteins from transfected
HEK293 cells, Kunitoku et al. (2003) demonstrated direct interaction
between CENPA (117139) and AURKA. In vitro, AURKA phosphorylated CENPA
on ser7, a residue that is also phosphorylated by AURKB. Examination of
the role of both kinases in the phosphorylation of CENPA revealed that
the reaction is mediated sequentially by AURKA and AURKB in early
mitosis. Mitotic cells in which the phosphorylation of CENPA on ser7 was
prevented exhibited a substantial proportion of misaligned chromosomes
resulting from a defect in the ability of kinetochores to attach to
microtubules.

Lampson et al. (2004) examined the role of Aurora kinases during mitosis
in rat kangaroo kidney cells with use of small reversible inhibitors of
molecular motors and Aurora kinases. Maloriented chromosomes accumulated
in the presence of an Aurora kinase inhibitor following spindle
bipolarization. The inhibitor was removed to activate the kinase and the
orientation of the chromosomes was corrected. In the correction process,
the maloriented chromosomes first moved to the pole, then moved to the
opposite pole, resulting in alignment at the metaphase plate. The manner
of K-fiber shortening suggested that kinetochores remained attached to
the microtubule plus ends, and that Aurora B function had been
interrupted by the inhibitor. Lampson et al. (2004) concluded that
syntelic malorientations (both sister kinetocores attached to the same
pole) can be corrected by selective K-fiber disassembly, coupled with
movement to the pole.

Andrews et al. (2004) presented evidence that Aurora B inhibits the
microtubule depolymerizing activity of mitotic centromere-associated
kinesin (MCAK; 604538) by phosphorylating MCAK on ser92. This
phosphorylation also regulated MCAK translocalization from kinetochores
to the centromere, and disruption of Aurora B function prevented
centromeric MCAK targeting. Andrews et al. (2004) concluded that Aurora
B regulates MCAK activity and cellular localization.

Hirota et al. (2005) showed that antibodies against mitotic chromosome
antigens that are associated with human autoimmune diseases specifically
recognize histone H3 (see 602810) molecules that are modified by both
trimethylation of lys9 and phosphorylation of ser10 (H3K9me3S10ph). The
generation of H3K9me3S10ph depends on Suv39h (see 300254) and Aurora B,
and occurs at pericentric heterochromatin during mitosis in different
eukaryotes. Most heterochromatin protein-1 (HP1; 604478) typically
dissociates from chromosomes during mitosis, but if phosphorylation of
H3 ser10 is inhibited, HP1 remains chromosome-bound throughout mitosis.
H3 phosphorylation by Aurora B is therefore part of a 'methyl/phos
switch' mechanism that displaces HP1 and perhaps other proteins from
mitotic heterochromatin.

Ramadan et al. (2007) showed that p97 (601023) stimulates nucleus
reformation by inactivating the chromatin-associated kinase Aurora B.
During mitosis, Aurora B inhibits nucleus reformation by preventing
chromosome decondensation and formation of the nuclear envelope
membrane. During exit from mitosis, p97 binds to Aurora B after its
ubiquitylation and extracts it from chromatin. This leads to
inactivation of Aurora B on chromatin, thus allowing chromatin
decondensation and nuclear envelope formation. Ramadan et al. (2007)
concluded that their data revealed an essential pathway that regulates
reformation of the nucleus after mitosis and defined ubiquitin-dependent
protein extraction as a common mechanism of Cdc48/p97 activity also
during nucleus formation.

Rosasco-Nitcher et al. (2008) investigated the activation of Aurora B
and described 2 distinct activation mechanisms. First, Aurora B
activation in vitro requires 2 cofactors, telophase disc-60 kD, or TD60
(RCC2; 609587) and microtubules. TD60 is critical to localize both the
chromosome passenger complex (CPC) and haspin (609240) kinase activity
to centromeres and thus regulates Aurora B at several levels. Second,
Aurora B substrates can inhibit kinase activation, and this is relieved
by phosphorylation of these substrates by the centromeric kinases Plk1
(602098) and haspin. Rosasco-Nitcher et al. (2008) concluded that these
regulatory mechanisms suggested models for phosphorylation by Aurora B
of centromeric substrates at unaligned chromosomes and merotelic
attachments.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a HeLa cell cDNA library and pull-down
assays using recombinant proteins, Sun et al. (2008) showed that the
C-terminal tail of EB1 (MAPRE1; 603108) interacted specifically with the
catalytic domain of AURKB. The proteins colocalized on the central
spindle in anaphase and in the midbody during cytokinesis in simian
kidney cells, and endogenous EB1 and AURKB coimmunoprecipitated from
HeLa cells. EB1 overexpression enhanced AURKB kinase activity, and
knockdown of EB1 with small interfering RNA impaired AURKB activity. EB1
protected AURKB from dephosphorylation/inactivation by protein
phosphatase-2A (PP2A; see 176915) by blocking binding of PP2A to AURKB.
Sun et al. (2008) concluded that EB1 stimulates AURKB activity by
antagonizing its dephosphorylation/inactivation by PP2A.

Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based biosensors to measure
localized phosphorylation dynamics in living cells, Liu et al. (2009)
found that phosphorylation of an Aurora B substrate at the kinetochore
depended on its distance from the kinase at the inner centromere.
Furthermore, repositioning Aurora B closer to the kinetochore prevented
stabilization of bioriented attachments and activated the spindle
checkpoint. Thus, Liu et al. (2009) concluded that centromere tension
can be sensed by increased spatial separation of Aurora B from
kinetochore substrates, which reduces phosphorylation and stabilizes
kinetochore microtubules.

Wang et al. (2010) showed that phosphorylation of histone H3 threonine-3
(H3T3) by haspin is necessary for CPC accumulation at centromeres and
that the CPC subunit survivin (603352) binds directly to phosphorylated
H3T3 (H3T3ph). A nonbinding survivin-D70A/D71A mutant did not support
CPC complex concentration, and both haspin depletion and
survivin-D70A/D71A mutation diminished centromere localization of the
kinesin MCAK (604538) and the mitotic checkpoint response to taxol.
Survivin-D70A/D71A mutation and microinjection of H3T3ph-specific
antibody both compromised centromeric Aurora B functions but did not
prevent cytokinesis. Therefore, Wang et al. (2010) concluded that H3T3ph
generated by haspin positions the CPC at centromeres to regulate
selected targets of Aurora B during mitosis.

Kelly et al. (2010) demonstrated that H3T3ph is directly recognized by
an evolutionarily conserved binding pocket in the BIR domain of the CPC
subunit survivin. This binding mediates recruitment of the CPC to
chromosomes and the resulting activation of its kinase subunit Aurora B.
Consistently, modulation of the kinase activity of haspin, which
phosphorylates H3T3, leads to defects in the Aurora B-dependent
processes of spindle assembly and inhibition of nuclear reformation.
Kelly et al. (2010) concluded that their findings established a direct
cellular role for mitotic H3T3 phosphorylation, which is read and
translated by the CPC to ensure accurate cell division.

Yamagishi et al. (2010) showed that phosphorylation of H3T3 mediated by
haspin cooperates with bub1 (602452)-mediated histone 2A-serine-121
(H2A-S121) phosphorylation in targeting the CPC to the inner centromere
in fission yeast and human cells. Phosphorylated H3T3 promotes
nucleosome binding of survivin, whereas phosphorylated H2A-S121
facilitates the binding of shugoshin (609168), the centromeric CPC
adaptor. Haspin colocalizes with cohesin by associating with Pds5 (see
613200), whereas bub1 localizes at kinetochores. Thus, Yamagishi et al.
(2010) concluded that the inner centromere is defined by intersection of
2 histone kinases.

Campbell and Desai (2013) showed that an engineered truncation of the
Sli15 (INCENP; 604411) subunit of budding yeast CPC that eliminates
association with the inner centromere nevertheless supports proper
chromosome segregation during both mitosis and meiosis. Truncated Sli15
suppressed the deletion phenotypes of the inner centromere-targeting
proteins Bir1 (survivin), Nbl1 (borealin; 609977), Bub1, and Sgo1
(shugoshin). Unlike wildtype Sli15, truncated Sli15 localized to
preanaphase spindle microtubules. Premature targeting of full-length
Sli15 to microtubules by preventing Cdk1 (110940) phosphorylation also
suppressed the inviability of Bir1 deletion. Campbell and Desai (2013)
concluded that activation of Aurora B kinase by clustering either on
chromatin or on microtubules is sufficient for chromosome biorientation.

MAPPING

By FISH and radiation hybrid analysis, Kimura et al. (1998) mapped the
STK12 gene to 17p13.1. Tatsuka et al. (1998) noted that the STK12 gene
is localized in a region that is frequently deleted in tumors and that
contains tumor-related genes such as p53 (191170), CRK (164762), and ABR
(600365). Using interspecific backcross mapping, Shindo et al. (1998)
mapped the mouse Stk12 gene to chromosome 11 in a region showing
homology of synteny with human 17p.

186745	TITLE *186745 TALIN 1; TLN1
;;TALIN; TLN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Talin serves a function of linking vinculin (193065) to the integrins,
and, thus, the cytoskeleton to extracellular matrix (ECM) receptors. It
has a mass of 270 kD and shares 23% N-terminal identity with ezrin
(123900), which has similar functions.

GENE FUNCTION

DiPaolo et al. (2002) and Ling et al. (2002) presented evidence that
talin, through its FERM domain, interacts with the C-terminal tail of
the 90-kD PIP5K1C (606102) isoform. The authors showed that this
interaction induces clustering of PIP5D1C and talin at focal adhesions
and increases the local production of
phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate.

Mechanical forces on matrix-integrin-cytoskeleton linkages are crucial
for cell viability, morphology, and organ function. The production of
force depends on the molecular connections from ECM-integrin complexes
to the cytoskeleton. The minimal matrix complex causing
integrin-cytoskeleton connections is a trimer of fibronectin's (135600)
integrin-binding domain FNIII7-10. Jiang et al. (2003) reported a
specific molecular slip bond that was repeatedly broken by a force of 2
pN at the cellular loading rate of 60 nm/second; this occurred with
single trimer beads but not with the monomer. Talin-1, which binds to
integrins and actin filaments in vitro, is required for the 2-pN slip
bond and rapid cytoskeleton binding. Furthermore, Jiang et al. (2003)
showed that inhibition of fibronectin binding to alpha-v-beta-3 integrin
(193210 and 173470) and deletion of beta-3 markedly decreased the 2-pN
force peak. They suggested that talin-1 initially forms a molecular slip
bond between closely packed fibronectin-integrin complexes and the actin
cytoskeleton, which can apply a low level of force to fibronectin until
many bonds form or a signal is received to activate a force response.

Tadokoro et al. (2003) reported that specific binding of the
cytoskeletal protein talin to integrin beta subunit (135630) cytoplasmic
tails leads to the conformational rearrangements of integrin
extracellular domains that increase their affinity. They found that
regulated binding of talin to integrin beta tails is a final common
element of cellular signaling cascades that control integrin activation.

Hu et al. (2007) developed correlational fluorescent speckle microscopy
to measure the coupling of focal adhesion proteins to actin filaments
(see 102610). Different classes of focal adhesion structural and
regulatory molecules exhibited varying degrees of correlated motions
with actin filaments, indicating hierarchical transmission of actin
motion through focal adhesions. Interactions between vinculin (193065),
talin, and actin filaments appear to constitute a slippage interface
between the cytoskeleton and integrins, generating a molecular clutch
that is regulated during the morphodynamic transitions of cell
migration.

Kanchanawong et al. (2010) used 3-dimensional super-resolution
fluorescence microscopy to map nanoscale protein organization in focal
adhesions. Their results revealed that integrins and actin are
vertically separated by an approximately 40-nm focal adhesion core
region consisting of multiple protein-specific strata: a
membrane-apposed integrin signaling layer containing integrin
cytoplasmic tails (see 193210), focal adhesion kinase (600758), and
paxillin (602505); an intermediate force-transduction layer containing
talin and vinculin; and an uppermost actin-regulatory layer containing
zyxin (602002), vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (601703), and
alpha-actinin (102575). By localizing amino- and carboxy-terminally
tagged talins, Kanchanawong et al. (2010) revealed talin's polarized
orientation, indicative of a role in organizing the focal adhesion
strata. Kanchanawong et al. (2010) concluded that their composite
multilaminar protein architecture provided a molecular blueprint for
understanding focal adhesion functions.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Using magnetic tweezers, total internal reflection fluorescence, and
atomic force microscopy, del Rio et al. (2009) investigated the effect
of force on the interaction between talin, a protein that links liganded
membrane integrins to the cytoskeleton, and vinculin, a focal adhesion
protein that is activated by talin binding, leading to reorganization of
the cytoskeleton. Application of physiologically relevant forces caused
stretching of single talin rods that exposed cryptic binding sites for
vinculin. Thus in the talin-vinculin system, molecular
mechanotransduction can occur by protein binding after exposure of
buried binding sites in the talin-vinculin system.

MAPPING

Using PCR amplification and DNA from a panel of human/rodent somatic
cell hybrids, Gilmore et al. (1995) assigned the TLN gene to 9p.
Deletions in 9p have been implicated in a variety of cancers. That a
cytoskeletal protein associated with the cell adhesion apparatus, such
as talin, might behave as a tumor suppressor gene has been proposed. For
example, the APC tumor suppressor gene (APC; 611731) encodes a protein
that associates with beta-catenin (CTNNB1; 116806), a component of a
complex of proteins linked to the cytoplasmic face of the cadherin
family of cell-cell adhesion molecules. Similarly, talin is a component
of a complex of proteins linked to the cytoplasmic face of integrins in
cell-ECM junctions (Luna and Hitt, 1992).
