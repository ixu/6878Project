;;MELANOMA-DERIVED LEUCINE ZIPPER-CONTAINING EXTRANUCLEAR FACTOR; MLZE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for genes upregulated in metastatic mouse melanoma cells,
Watabe et al. (2001) cloned mouse Gsdmc, which they called Mlze. By
searching an EST database for sequences similar to mouse Mlze, followed
by screening a HeLa cell cDNA library, they cloned human GSDMC. The
deduced 508-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 57 kD.
MLZE contains an N-terminal region rich in basic amino acids, followed
by 2 potential nuclear localization signals and a C-terminal leucine
zipper structure. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.8-kb transcript
expressed predominantly in trachea and spleen. In vitro translation of
MLZE showed a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 60 kD.
Immunohistochemical staining of normal skin, nevus, and melanoma located
MLZE in the cytoplasm.

By database and sequence analysis, Tamura et al. (2007) identified
several members of the GSDM family, including GSDMC.

GENE FUNCTION

Watabe et al. (2001) found that mouse melanocytes did not express Mlze
and that expression of Mlze increased with the metastatic potential of
several mouse melanoma cell lines. In human melanomas, the number of
MLZE-positive cases was significantly larger in Clark levels III, IV,
and V melanomas (6 of 11; 55%) than in Clark levels I and II melanomas
(2 of 15; 13%). In 2 cases of MLZE-positive melanomas, the strength of
MLZE staining increased substantially in the deep component of the
tumor.

MAPPING

By FISH, Watabe et al. (2001) mapped the GSDMC gene to chromosome
8q24.1-q24.2.

By genomic sequence analysis, Tamura et al. (2007) mapped the GSDMC gene
to chromosome 8q24.2. Tamura et al. (2007) identified 4 GSDMC orthologs,
which they called Gsdmc1 through Gsdmc4, on mouse chromosome 15D1, which
shows homology of synteny to human chromosome 8q24.2.

161565	TITLE *161565 NATURAL KILLER TUMOR RECOGNITION SEQUENCE; NKTR
;;NATURAL KILLER TRIGGERING RECEPTOR
DESCRIPTION The natural killer triggering receptor (NKTR) is involved in the
recognition of tumor cells by large granular lymphocytes (LGLs) (Frey et
al., 1991; Anderson et al., 1993). LGLs are a subpopulation of white
blood cells that have the ability to kill target tumor cells by an
MHC-independent mechanism. The protein product of the NKTR gene is
present on the surface of LGLs and facilitates their binding to tumor
targets. The gene codes for a protein of 150,000 Da, with a unique amino
acid structure consisting of a 58-amino acid hydrophobic amino terminus
followed by a cyclophilin-related domain. No other known mammalian
receptor gene has been found to contain this strong identity to the
cyclophilin protein in an external domain. By somatic cell hybrid
analysis, Young et al. (1993) assigned the NKTR gene to 3p23-p21.
Interspecific backcross analysis demonstrated that the murine homolog
maps to the distal end of mouse chromosome 9 and is closely linked to
the locus coding for cholecystokinin (Cck). This region of mouse 9
shares a region of homology with human 3p. Hybridization to DNA from a
variety of species including the monkey, cat, and dog was observed,
indicating that this gene is highly conserved among mammalian species.

Rinfret and Anderson (1993) observed 2 alternative splicing events in
the 5-prime region of the NKTR mRNA in human and mouse. One uses an
alternative exon 6 that disrupts the NKTR coding region and produces an
mRNA encoding a truncated protein. The other splicing event generates a
deletion by use of an alternative splice acceptor within exon 9. Rinfret
and Anderson (1993) observed all 4 possible combinations of these events
in cDNAs. Activation of natural killer cells by IL2 (147680) changes the
pattern of splicing, resulting in increased production of full-length
protein. Simons-Evelyn et al. (1997) characterized the first 8 exons and
5-prime region of mouse Nktr. They found that mouse intron 5 also
contains the alternative exon that disrupts the open reading frame.

;;KIAA1226;;
NEUROTENSIN ENDOPEPTIDASE;;
ANGIOTENSIN-BINDING PROTEIN; AGTBP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Neurolysin (EC 3.4.24.16) is an enzyme involved in the metabolic
inactivation of bioactive peptides (Garrido et al., 1999).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned a partial NLN cDNA, which they
designated KIAA1226. RT-PCR ELISA detected strong expression in human
liver, brain, and kidney, moderate expression in heart, skeletal muscle,
ovary, spinal cord, fetal liver, and fetal brain, and low expression in
pancreas and lung. In specific brain regions examined, amygdala, corpus
callosum, and caudate nucleus showed strong expression, with moderate
expression in cerebellum, hippocampus, substantia nigra, and thalamus.

By immunocytochemical and Western blot analysis, Garrido et al. (1999)
observed a punctate distribution for Nln in mouse pituitary
corticotrophic cells. Nln colocalized with syntaxin-6 (STX6; 603944) in
the juxtanuclear region and was found in small vesicular organelles
throughout the cell body, colocalizing with ACTH in some organelles.

GENE FUNCTION

Norman et al. (2003) showed that NLN and thimet oligopeptidase (THOP1;
601117) have endopeptidase activity and demonstrated their presence in
ovine aortic and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Both membrane
and soluble NLN catalyzed cleavage of bradykinin at the phe5-ser6 bond,
although there were other kininases active at this peptide bond.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the NLN
gene to chromosome 5 (TMAP RH48357).

606704	TITLE *606704 G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR 75; GPR75
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

GPR75 is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family. GPRs are
cell surface receptors that activate guanine-nucleotide binding proteins
upon the binding of a ligand.

CLONING

During the construction of a physical map of the Doyne honeycomb retinal
dystrophy (126600) critical region on 2p16, Tarttelin et al. (1999)
identified GPR75 from an EST derived from a clone isolated from a
retinal cDNA library. The full-length GPR75 sequence predicts a
540-amino acid polypeptide. The protein contains 7 transmembrane
spanning regions characteristic of GPRs. Northern blot analysis of human
tissues detected an approximately 7-kb transcript at high levels in
brain and spinal cord and at detectable levels in retinal pigment
epithelium (RPE). In situ hybridization of adult eye sections localized
GPR75 transcripts only to the perivascular cells, surrounding retinal
arterioles, in the ganglion cell/nerve fiber layer.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tarttelin et al. (1999) found that the entire coding region of the GPR75
gene is contained within a single exon.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By direct sequencing of genomic DNA from individuals from 6 different
families with Doyne honeycomb retinal dystrophy, Tarttelin et al. (1999)
found no mutations associated with the disease phenotype.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Tarttelin et al. (1999) mapped the GPR75 gene to
chromosome 2p16.

607003	TITLE *607003 THYMIC STROMAL LYMPHOPOIETIN; TSLP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Several cytokines, including interleukin-7 (IL7; 146660), play a key
role in the development of B lymphocytes. TSLP is a member of this
family of B cell-stimulating factors.

CLONING

By EST and genomic database screening for sequences similar to IL7,
followed by screening a lung fibroblast sarcoma cDNA library, Reche et
al. (2001) obtained a cDNA encoding TSLP. The deduced 159-amino acid
protein, which is only 43% identical to mouse Tslp, contains a
28-residue signal sequence, 6 cysteines, and 2 N-glycosylation sites.
SDS-PAGE analysis showed expression of a 23-kD protein, larger than the
predicted 15 kD, suggesting that TSLP is glycosylated. PCR analysis of a
panel of cDNA libraries and cultured cell lines indicated that
expression of a 1.3-kb TSLP transcript may be restricted to a few lung
libraries. Reche et al. (2001) also identified TSLP receptor, which is
composed of TSLPR (CRLF2; 300357) and IL7R (146661) subunits. Dendritic
cells (DCs) and monocytes coexpress IL7R and TSLPR.

Quentmeier et al. (2001) also cloned and characterized TSLP. They noted
the presence of 7 basic C-terminal amino acids (KKRRKRK) in the protein
and that 6 of the 7 cysteines in the mouse protein (those involved in
disulfide bond formation) are conserved in human, whereas the sites for
N-glycosylation are distinct. Northern blot analysis revealed wide
expression of an approximately 1.1-kb transcript, with highest levels in
heart, liver, testis, and prostate.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Quentmeier et al. (2001) mapped the
TSLP gene to chromosome 5 in a region showing homology of synteny to
mouse chromosome 18, where the mouse Tslp gene is localized.

GENE FUNCTION

Reche et al. (2001) showed that incubation of DCs or monocytes with TSLP
enhanced the expression of CCL17 (601520), CCL18 (603757), CCL22
(602957), and CCL19 (602227). IL7, on the other hand, induced expression
of CCL17, CCL22, and CCL19, but also CXCL8 (146930), CXCL7 (121010),
CXCL5 (600324), CXCL1 (155730), CXCL2 (139110), and CXCL3 (139111).
Functional analysis indicated that TSLP enhances the DC maturation
process, as evidenced by upregulation of DC markers and costimulatory
molecules and stronger T-cell proliferation.

By screening myeloid cell lines, Quentmeier et al. (2001) established
that an acute myeloid leukemia line, MUTZ-3, responds by proliferating
in response to TSLP. TSLP also inhibited apoptosis in these cells.
Proliferation in response to TSLP could not be attributed to the
production of other growth factors tested and could be inhibited by
relatively high concentrations of anti-IL7R. TSLP, like IL7, stimulated
phosphorylation of STAT5 (601511), but unlike IL7, it did not activate
JAK3 (600173). TSLP did not phosphorylate mitogen-activated protein
kinases (e.g., ERK1; 601795).

By flow cytometric analysis, Soumelis et al. (2002) showed that
TSLP-activated DCs (TSLP-DCs) express higher levels of HLA-DR and DCLAMP
(605883) than do nonactivated or IL7-activated DCs, and that TSLP-DCs
induce marked proliferation and expansion of allogeneic naive CD4
(186940)-positive T cells. Quantitative mRNA screening and ELISA
analysis showed that TSLP-DCs do not produce detectable proinflammatory
cytokines, but do produce high levels of TARC (CCL17) and MDC (CCL22)
chemokines, which preferentially attract CCR4 (604836)-expressing Th2
lymphocytes. TSLP-DCs induced CD4 cells to produce high amounts of IL13
(147683), IL5 (147850), and the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis
factor (TNF; 191160), but only low amounts of IL10 (124092) and
gamma-interferon (IFNG; 147570). RT-PCR analysis did not detect TSLP in
most hemopoietic cells, the exception being mast cells. Keratinocytes,
epithelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and lung fibroblasts also
expressed high levels of TSLP. Within tonsils, highest levels were in
crypt epithelial cells. Soumelis et al. (2002) suggested that TSLP may
contribute to constitutive inflammation in this tissue and sporadic
inflammation in squamous epithelium. Immunohistochemical analysis of
allergic inflammatory tissue showed high expression of TSLP in
keratinocytes of acute and chronic atopic dermatitis lesions, but no
expression in normal skin. Strong TSLP expression in atopic dermatitis
was associated with the disappearance of langerin (604862)-positive
Langerhans cells within the epidermis and the concurrent appearance of
many DCLAMP-activated DCs within the dermis, many of which expressed
langerin. Soumelis et al. (2002) proposed that TSLP expression by
keratinocytes in atopic dermatitis lesions may contribute directly to
the activation of Langerhans cells, which may migrate into the dermis
and then the draining lymph nodes where they can prime allergen-specific
Th2 responses.

Watanabe et al. (2005) reported that human Hassall corpuscles express
TSLP. Human TSLP activates thymic CD11c+ (151510) dendritic cells to
express high levels of CD80 (112203) and CD86 (601020). These
TSLP-conditioned cells are then able to induce the proliferation and
differentiation of CD4+/CD8-(186910)/CD25-(147730) thymic T cells into
CD4+/CD25+/FOXP3+ (300292) regulatory T cells. This induction depends on
peptide-MHC class II interactions and the presence of CD80 and CD86 as
well as IL2 (147680). Immunohistochemistry studies revealed that
CD25+/CTLA4+(123890) regulatory T cells associate in the thymic medulla
with activated or mature dendritic cells and TSLP-expressing Hassall
corpuscles. Watanabe et al. (2005) concluded that Hassall corpuscles
have a critical role in dendritic cell-mediated secondary positive
selection of medium to high affinity self-reactive T cells, leading to
the generation of CD4+/CD25+ regulatory T cells within the thymus.

Siracusa et al. (2011) demonstrated that TSLP promotes systemic
basophilia, that disruption of TSLP-TSLPR interactions results in
defective basophil responses, and that TSLPR-sufficient basophils can
restore TH2-cell-dependent immunity in vivo. TSLP acted directly on bone
marrow-resident progenitors to promote basophil responses selectively.
Critically, TSLP could elicit basophil responses in both IL3
(147740)-IL3R (see 308385)-sufficient and -deficient environments, and
genomewide transcriptional profiling and functional analyses identified
heterogeneity between TSLP-elicited versus IL3-elicited basophils.
Furthermore, activated human basophils expressed TSLPR, and basophils
isolated from eosinophilic esophagitis (see 610247) patients were
distinct from classical basophils. Siracusa et al. (2011) concluded that
collectively, their studies identified previously unrecognized
heterogeneity within the basophil cell lineage and indicated that
expression of TSLP may influence susceptibility to multiple allergic
diseases by regulating basophil hematopoiesis and eliciting a population
of functionally distinct basophils that promote TH2 cytokine-mediated
inflammation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

For discussion of a possible association between variation in the TSLP
gene and eosinophilic esophagitis, see EOE2 (613412).

ANIMAL MODEL

Using mice deficient in Il7r and/or the common cytokine receptor gamma
chain, Il2rg (308380), Vobhenrich et al. (2003) determined the cytokines
responsible for fetal and perinatal lymphopoiesis in the absence of Il7.
Fetal and perinatal B-cell lymphopoiesis occurred in the bone marrow of
Il2rg -/- mice until 12 weeks of age, but it was absent in Il7r -/- mice
by 4 weeks of age. Lymphopoiesis in Il7r -/- mice was restricted to
fetal liver and was dependent on the presence of Tslp. The residual
lymphopoiesis that occurred in Il7r -/- mice was dependent on Flk2
(136351). Vobhenrich et al. (2003) concluded that TSLP is the main
factor driving IL7-independent fetal and perinatal lymphopoiesis,
although FLK2 is involved.

Using a mouse model of allergic skin inflammation elicited by repeated
epicutaneous (EC) sensitization with ovalbumin (OVA) to tape-stripped
skin, which mimics the scratching-inflicted injury associated with
atopic dermatitis (see 603165), He et al. (2008) found that Tslpr -/-
mice had reduced inflammation, with fewer eosinophils and local Th2
cytokine expression, but unchanged splenocyte secretion of these
cytokines. Addition of Tslp significantly enhanced Th2 cytokine
secretion in vitro by targeting Tlspr on antigen-specific T cells.
Intradermal injection of anti-Tlsp blocked the development of allergic
skin inflammation after EC antigen challenge of OVA-immunized wildtype
mice. He et al. (2008) proposed that TLSP is essential for
antigen-driven Th2 cytokine secretion by skin-infiltrating effector T
cells.

603615	TITLE *603615 RAD54, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG-LIKE; RAD54L
;;HR54;;
HRAD54
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Repair of double-stranded DNA breaks is essential for homologous
recombination in somatic cells to protect DNA from damage by ionizing
radiation and other genotoxins. The rad52 pathway is required for
homologous recombination in the yeast S. cerevisiae. Kanaar et al.
(1996) searched for mammalian homologs of yeast rad54, an essential
component of this pathway and a member of the rad52 group. Using RT-PCR
with degenerate primers, Kanaar et al. (1996) identified the mouse and
human homologs of S. cerevisiae rad54. The human homolog, HR54, is 48%
identical to the yeast protein and belongs to the SNF2/SWI2 family,
which is characterized by amino acid motifs found in DNA-dependent
ATPases. Proteins in the SNF2/SWI2 family are involved in many aspects
of DNA metabolism, including transcription, repair, and recombination.
HR54 protein is located in the nucleus, consistent with its nuclear
localization signal and a potential function in DNA metabolism.
Expression of HR54 increased approximately 3-fold in late G1 phase; this
pattern is similar to that in yeast. HR54 was able to partially
complement the DNA repair defect of S. cerevisiae rad54-deleted cells.
By Northern blot analysis, Kanaar et al. (1996) showed that expression
of the mouse homolog of HR54 is increased in organs of lymphoid and germ
cell development. Mouse expression was 3-fold higher in spermatocytes
than in spermatids, suggesting that HR54 plays a role in meiotic
recombination.

GENE FUNCTION

Solinger et al. (2002) showed that RAD54 protein dissociates RAD51
(179617) from nucleoprotein filaments formed on double-stranded DNA
(dsDNA). Addition of RAD54 protein overcame inhibition of DNA strand
exchange by RAD51 protein bound to substrate dsDNA. Species preference
in the RAD51 dissociation and DNA strand exchange assays underlined the
importance of specific RAD54-RAD51 protein interactions. RAD51 protein
was unable to release dsDNA upon ATP hydrolysis, leaving it stuck on the
heteroduplex DNA product after DNA strand exchange. The authors
suggested that RAD54 protein is involved in the turnover of RAD51-dsDNA
filaments.

Bugreev et al. (2006) showed that RAD54 binds Holliday junction-like
structures with high specificity and promotes their bidirectional branch
migration in an ATPase-dependent manner. The activity seemed to be
conserved in human and yeast Rad54 orthologs. In vitro, Rad54 had been
shown to stimulate DNA pairing of Rad51, a key homologous recombination
protein. However, genetic data indicated that Rad54 protein might also
act at later stages of homologous recombination, after Rad51. Bugreev et
al. (2006) concluded that novel DNA branch-migration activity is fully
consistent with this late homologous recombination function of Rad54
protein.

MAPPING

Kanaar et al. (1996) mapped the HR54 gene to chromosome 1p32 using
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Association of the recombinational repair protein RAD51 with tumor
suppressors BRCA1 (113705) and BRCA2 (600185) suggested that defects in
homologous recombination are responsible for tumor formation. This idea
was supported by the fact that the protein associated with the
MRE11/RAD50 repair complex (NBS1; 602667) is mutated in Nijmegen
breakage syndrome (251260), which is characterized by increased cancer
incidence and sensitivity to ionizing radiation. Since RAD51 forms a
complex with other members of the RAD52 (600392) epistasis group and
with BRCA proteins, it was reasonable to ask if alterations of members
of the RAD52 epistasis group lead to tumor development. Matsuda et al.
(1999) described missense mutations at functional regions of RAD54 and
the absence of the wildtype RAD54 expression resulting from aberrant
splicing in primary cancers. Since RAD54 is a recombination protein
associated with RAD51, this was the first genetic evidence that cancer
can arise from a defect in repair processes involving homologous
recombination. They observed a pro63-to-his mutation (603615.0001) of
the RAD54 gene in an adenocarcinoma of the colon and a val444-to-glu
mutation (603615.0002) in a non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Although pro at codon
63 and val at codon 444 are outside helicase motifs, Matsuda et al.
(1999) considered it likely that these amino acid substitutions affect
the function of RAD54. The mutations demonstrated by Matsuda et al.
(1999) were rare among the tumors studied: 95 breast cancers, 13
colorectal cancers, and 24 lymphomas.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ADENOCARCINOMA, COLONIC, SOMATIC
RAD54L, PRO63HIS

In an adenocarcinoma of the colon, Matsuda et al. (1999) found a C-to-A
transversion in the RAD54L gene converting pro to his at codon 63,
upstream of helicase domains. The corresponding normal tissue showed the
wildtype sequence, indicating that this was a somatic mutation.

.0002
LYMPHOMA, NON-HODGKIN, SOMATIC
RAD54L, VAL444GLU

In non-Hodgkin lymphoma tissue, Matsuda et al. (1999) found a T-to-A
transversion converting val to glu at codon 444 between helicase domains
III and IV of the RAD54L gene. Because they could not obtain the
corresponding normal tissue, they did not know whether this was a
germline mutation. The presence of wildtype alleles indicated that this
tumor, like the adenocarcinoma of the colon with pro63-to-his
(603615.0001) substitution, indicated that these tumors were
heterozygous for the mutations.

.0003
BREAST CANCER, INVASIVE DUCTAL
RAD54L, GLY325ARG

In one of 95 breast cancers studied, Matsuda et al. (1999) found a
G-to-A transition in the RAD54L gene converting gly to arg at codon 325
within helicase motif III. The absence of the wildtype allele indicated
that the tumor was homozygous (or hemizygous) for the mutation. The
corresponding normal tissue showed the same transition, indicating that
this was a germline mutation. A restriction-based screen, developed from
the fact that the gly325-to-arg mutation abolished an AccIII site,
revealed that this mutation was absent in 100 normal individuals. The
patient in this case was a 63-year-old woman with no obvious family
history of cancer.

611201	TITLE *611201 KELCH-LIKE 9; KLHL9
;;KIAA1354
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned KLHL9, which they designated
KIAA1354. The transcript contains a repetitive element in its 3-prime
end, and the deduced 632-amino acid protein shares significant
similarity with the actin-binding protein MAYVEN (KLHL2; 605774). RT-PCR
ELISA detected high KLHL9 expression in ovary and moderate expression in
all other tissues and specific brain regions examined.

Sumara et al. (2007) stated that KLHL9 contains a highly conserved BACK
(BTB and C-terminal Kelch) motif involved in spatially orienting
substrates in CUL3 (603136)-based ubiquitin E3 ligases.

GENE FUNCTION

Sumara et al. (2007) found that KLHL9, KLHL13 (300655), and CUL3
interacted directly in a 370-kD protein complex in HeLa cell lysates.
The CUL3/KLHL9/KLHL13 complex was the minimum unit required for correct
chromosome alignment in metaphase, proper midzone and midbody formation,
and completion of cytokinesis. CUL3/KLHL9/KLHL13 acted as an E3 ligase
and regulated dynamic localization of the chromosomal passenger protein
Aurora B (AURKB; 604970) on mitotic chromosomes and accumulation of
Aurora B on the central spindle after anaphase onset. Aurora B directly
bound the substrate-recognition domains of KLHL9 and KLHL13 in vitro and
coimmunoprecipitated with the CUL3/KLHL9/KLHL13 complex during mitosis.
Moreover, Aurora B was ubiquitylated in a CUL3-dependent manner in vivo
and by reconstituted CUL3/KLHL9/KLHL13 in vitro. Sumara et al. (2007)
concluded that CUL3/KLHL9/KLHL13 is an E3 ligase that controls the
dynamic behavior of Aurora B on mitotic chromosomes and thereby
coordinates faithful mitotic progression and completion of cytokinesis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hardy et al. (2004) determined that KLHL9 is an intronless gene that
spans 4.0 to 4.5 kb. It has a CpG island at its 5-prime end.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Hardy et al. (2004) mapped the KLHL9 gene
to chromosome 9p21, where it lies near a cluster of interferon genes.
They mapped the mouse Klhl9 gene to a region of chromosome 4C4 that
shares homology of synteny with human chromosome 9p21.

Hartz (2013) mapped the KLHL9 gene to chromosome 9p21.3 based on an
alignment of the KLHL9 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB037775) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;KIAA1378
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned KLHL8, which they designated
KIAA1378. The mRNA contains a repetitive element in its 3-prime UTR, and
the deduced 451-amino acid protein shares 36% identity with the
actin-binding protein MAYVEN (KLHL2; 605774). RT-PCR ELISA detected
highest expression in adult brain, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and
ovary, and in several specific brain regions, predominantly amygdala and
thalamus. Moderate expression was detected in all other adult and fetal
tissues examined.

MAPPING

Hartz (2008) mapped the KLHL8 gene to chromosome 4q22.1 based on an
alignment of the KLHL8 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB037799) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

605086	TITLE *605086 TRIGGERING RECEPTOR EXPRESSED ON MYELOID CELLS 2; TREM2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Monocyte/macrophage- and neutrophil-mediated inflammatory responses can
be stimulated through a variety of receptors, including G protein-linked
7-transmembrane receptors (e.g., FPR1; 136537), Fc receptors (see
146790), CD14 (158120) and Toll-like receptors (e.g., TLR4; 603030), and
cytokine receptors (e.g., IFNGR1; 107470). Engagement of these receptors
can also prime myeloid cells to respond to other stimuli. Myeloid cells
express receptors belonging to the Ig superfamily, such as TREM2, or to
the C-type lectin superfamily. Depending on their transmembrane and
cytoplasmic sequence structure, these receptors have either activating
(e.g., KIR2DS1; 604952) or inhibitory functions (e.g., KIR2DL1; 604936).

CLONING

By searching an EST database with TREM1 (605085) as the probe, Bouchon
et al. (2000) identified a cDNA encoding TREM2. The predicted 230-amino
acid TREM2 protein was expressed on macrophages and dendritic cells but
not on granulocytes or monocytes, suggesting a role for TREM2 in chronic
rather than acute inflammatory conditions.

GENE FUNCTION

TREM2 forms a receptor signaling complex with TYROBP (604142) (Campbell
and Colonna, 1999; Bouchon et al., 2001) and triggers activation of the
immune responses in macrophages and dendritic cells (Lanier and Bakker,
2000). Patients with polycystic lipomembranous osteodysplasia with
sclerosing leukoencephalopathy (PLOSL; 221770), in whom mutations in the
TYROBP and TREM2 genes have been identified (see later), have no defects
in cell-mediated immunity, suggesting a remarkable capacity of the human
immune system to compensate for the inactive TYROBP-mediated activation
pathway. The data of Paloneva et al. (2002) suggested that the
TYROBP-mediated signaling pathway plays a significant role in human
brain and bone tissue and provide an interesting example of how
mutations in 2 different subunits of a multisubunit receptor complex
result in an identical human disease phenotype.

Paloneva et al. (2003) analyzed differentiation of peripheral blood
mononuclear cells from DAP12 (TYROBP)- and TREM2-deficient Finnish or
German PLOSL patients into osteoclasts. They found that homozygous
loss-of-function mutations in DAP12 or TREM2 resulted in inefficient,
aberrant, and delayed differentiation into osteoclasts and significantly
diminished bone resorption capability in vitro. RT-PCR analysis detected
no differences between patient and control cells in the expression of
several genes, but expression of DAP12 and TREM2 increased in control
cells during osteoclastic differentiation. Paloneva et al. (2003)
concluded that the DAP12-TREM2 signaling complex is important in the
differentiation and function of osteoclasts. Independently, Cella et al.
(2003) also showed that TREM2-deficient patients have impaired
osteoclast differentiation and function.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Allcock et al. (2003) determined that all
genes in the TREM cluster have an exon encoding the 5-prime UTR and
leader peptide, a second exon encoding the IgV domain, and a variable
number of downstream exons encoding the stalk, transmembrane, and
cytoplasmic regions. TREM2 contains 5 exons. A soluble splice variant of
TREM2 lacks exon 4, which encodes the transmembrane region.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis, Bouchon et al. (2000) mapped the TREM1
and TREM2 genes to chromosome 6, where LY95 (604531) is located. By
genomic sequence analysis, Allcock et al. (2003) mapped the TREM2 gene
to chromosome 6p21.1, within a TREM gene cluster. The mouse Trem2 gene
maps to chromosome 17 in a region that shows homology of synteny to
human chromosome 6.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Polycystic lipomembranous osteodysplasia with sclerosing
leukoencephalopathy (221770) is a globally distributed recessively
inherited disorder leading to death during the fifth decade of life and
is characterized by early-onset progressive dementia and bone cysts.
Mutations in the TYROBP gene had been shown to cause the disorder, but
Paloneva et al. (2002) found that some patients did not have mutations
in the TYROBP gene. Paloneva et al. (2002) studied the segregation of
marker haplotypes flanking genes that encode polypeptides interacting
with TYROBP. The only chromosomal region showing complete segregation to
PLOSL was the 6p22-p21 region which includes the TREM2 gene. Mutations
in this gene were identified in each of 2 affected families, a Swedish
and a Norwegian family, and subsequently in 3 other families.

In 6 patients with PLOSL, including 2 sibs, Klunemann et al. (2005)
identified 4 different homozygous mutations in the TREM2 gene (see,
e.g., 605086.0006; 605086.0007).

For a discussion of an association between variation in the TREM2 gene
and late-onset Alzheimer disease, see AD17 (615080).

ANIMAL MODEL

Using flow cytometric analysis, Turnbull et al. (2006) demonstrated that
murine Trem2 was expressed on macrophages recruited to peripheral
tissues, but not on tissue-resident macrophages, circulating cells, or
myeloid progenitors. Il4 (147780) induced expression of Trem2 on
resident peritoneal cells. Mice lacking Trem2 were unable to inhibit
cytokine production in response to microbial products. There was no
difference in cytokine production by macrophages from Trem2-deficient
mice and Dap12-deficient mice, leading Turnbull et al. (2006) to
conclude that Trem2 is the receptor operative in the increased
macrophage cytokine production observed in Dap12-deficient cells. They
concluded that TREM2 expressed on newly differentiated and alternatively
activated macrophages functions to restrain macrophage activation.

Guerreiro et al. (2013) showed that expression of TREM2 rises in
parallel with a rise in cortical levels of beta-amyloid in the TgCRND8
mouse model of Alzheimer disease (104300). The dysregulation of
expression that is induced by beta-amyloid is relatively specific to
TREM2, as its partner TYROBP was not dysregulated.

615123	TITLE *615123 ANKYRIN REPEAT DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 13A; ANKRD13A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Some members of the ANKRD13 family, such as ANKRD13A, have a role in
regulating internalization of cell surface proteins (Tanno et al.,
2012).

CLONING

Tanno et al. (2012) cloned ANKRD13A from a human brain cDNA library. The
deduced 590-amino acid protein contains 3 N-terminal ankyrin repeats and
4 putative C-terminal ubiquitin-interacting motifs. Immunofluorescence
analysis of HeLa cells revealed that ANKRD13A localized to the plasma
membrane and late endosomes.

GENE FUNCTION

Monoubiquitination and/or lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains serve as
endocytosis signals that are tagged to a variety of cell surface
integral membrane proteins. Proteins of the endocytic machinery are also
regulated by their own ubiquitination. Using immunoprecipitation and
Western blot analysis of EGF (131530)-stimulated HeLa cells, Tanno et
al. (2012) showed that ANKRD13A, ANKRD13B (615124), and ANKRD13D
(615126), but not ANKRD13C (615125), bound to the ubiquitinated EGF
receptor (EGFR; 131550). Tanno et al. (2012) found that ANKRD13A was
itself monoubiquitinated, and this ubiquitination interfered with
interaction between ANKRD13A and ubiquitinated EGFR. Both ubiquitination
of ANKRD13A and binding of ANKRD13A to EGFR required the
ubiquitin-interacting motifs of ANKRD13A. Protein binding assays
revealed that ANKRD13A, ANKRD13B, and ANKRD13D bound to lys63-linked,
but not lys48-linked, polyubiquitin chains. Binding affinity was higher
with ubiquitin chain lengths between 4 and 7 units, with lower or no
affinity for shorter ubiquitin chain lengths. Overexpression of
ANKRD13A, ANKRD13B, and ANKRD13B delayed, but did not completely
inhibit, ligand-induced EGFR internalization. ANKRD13 proteins had no
effect on EGFR degradation. Overexpression of ANKRD13A also suppressed
uptake of nonubiquitinated cargo, such as transferrin receptor (TFRC;
190010).

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the ANKRD13A gene to chromosome 12q24.11 based on an
alignment of the ANKRD13A sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF064604) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;CARTILAGE-DERIVED MORPHOGENETIC PROTEIN 2; CDMP2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Growth/differentiation factor-6 is a member of the transforming growth
factor-beta (TGFB1; 190180) superfamily (Storm et al., 1994; Chang et
al., 1994).

CLONING

Using degenerate primers to amplify members of the TGF-beta/bone
morphogenic protein (BMP) family, Wolfman et al. (1997) obtained a
partial human GDF6 clone. The deduced mature protein contains 120 amino
acids and shares 99% identity with mouse Gdf6. GDF6 shares a high degree
of similarity with GDF5 (601146), GDF7 (604651), and several members of
the BMP family (e.g., BMP2; 112261).

By immunohistochemical analysis of mouse retina, Zhang et al. (2012)
detected Gdf6 in ganglion cell layer, inner plexiform layer, and retinal
pigment epithelia.

MAPPING

Hartz (2006) mapped the GDF6 gene to chromosome 8q22.1 based on an
alignment of the GDF6 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AJ537424, where the gene
is designated GDF16) with the genomic sequence (build 36.1).

GENE FUNCTION

Settle et al. (2003) found that mouse Gdf5 (601146), Gdf6, and Gdf7
(604651) are required for normal formation of bones and joints in the
limbs, skull, and axial skeleton. All were expressed in stripes across
developing skeletal condensations before the precursors had separated
into obviously distinct cartilage elements and joints. The expression of
Gdf5 and Gdf6 was much more restricted than that of Gdf7.

Zhang et al. (2012) found that knockout of Htra1 (602194) expression in
mice significantly upregulated expression of Gdf6 and downregulated
expression of Vegf (192240) in retinal pigment epithelia.

CYTOGENETICS

Colobomata (120200) represent visually impairing ocular closure defects
that are associated with a diverse range of developmental anomalies.
Asai-Coakwell et al. (2007) characterized a chromosome 8q21.2-q22.1
segmental deletion in a patient with chorioretinal coloboma, and found
elements of nonallelic homologous recombination and nonhomologous end
joining. The authors demonstrated that the segmental deletion
encompassed GDF6. The proband exhibited multiple developmental metabolic
defects, including neurodevelopmental impairment (performance IQ 74),
bilateral soft tissue syndactyly of the second and third toes, atrial
septal defect, and ocular malformations. The latter comprised bilateral
retinochoroidal colobomata with optic nerve involvement, plus a
unilateral iris coloboma, which reduced vision to counting fingers and
20/50 in the right and left eyes, respectively. Although the proband's
father was asymptomatic, ocular examination revealed features of much
milder developmental defects that included a minor degree of optic nerve
dysplasia, anomalous retinal vascular branching, and small
retinochoroidal colobomata. The karyotype of the proband was
46,XX,del(8)(q21.2-q22.1); this abnormality was found in neither parent.

Tassabehji et al. (2008) characterized the location of the inversion
inv(8)(q22.2q23.3) breakpoints originally reported by Clarke et al.
(1995) in the now expanded 5-generation family with autosomal dominant
Klippel-Feil syndrome. The 19.53-Mb inversion was flanked by a distal
breakpoint within an intergenic region 1.6 Mb 5-prime from CSMD3
(608399) and 400 kb 3-prime from TRPS1 (604386) and a proximal
breakpoint located 623 kb 3-prime of GDF6 within a region known to
harbor GDF6 long-range enhancer elements.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of a 3-generation family with autosomal dominant
Klippel-Feil syndrome (118100), Tassabehji et al. (2008) identified a
heterozygous mutation in the GDF6 gene (A249E; 601147.0001). A different
heterozygous mutation (L289P; 601147.0002) was identified in 2 unrelated
patients with sporadic Klippel-Feil syndrome.

Asai-Coakwell et al. (2009) screened DNA samples from 489 patients with
ocular anomalies (microphthalmia, clinical anophthalmia, and coloboma)
and 81 patients with vertebral segmentation anomalies for mutations in
the GDF6 gene. They identified heterozygosity for 7 different missense
mutations in 9 patients (see, e.g., 601147.0001 and
601147.0003-601147.0006), including 5 with isolated microphthalmia
(MCOP4; 613094), 1 with coloboma and postaxial polydactyly, and 3 with
Klippel-Feil syndrome, including 1 who was the proband of the family
previously reported by Tassabehji et al. (2008). Asai-Coakwell et al.
(2009) observed a spectrum of ocular and skeletal anomalies in morphant
zebrafish, the latter encompassing defective tail formation and altered
expression of somite markers noggin1 (NOG; 602991) and noggin2. Gdf6 +/-
mice exhibited variable ocular phenotypes compatible with phenotypes
observed in patients and zebrafish. Key differences evident between
patients and animal models included pleiotropic effects, variable
expressivity and incomplete penetrance.

Asai-Coakwell et al. (2013) analyzed the GDF6 gene in 279 DNA samples
from patients diagnosed with Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA17; 615360)
or juvenile retinitis pigmentosa (JRP) who were negative for mutation in
known causative genes, and identified compound heterozygosity for the
A249E substitution (601147.0001) and another missense mutations (D57H;
601147.0008) in 1 LCA proband. Three additional heterozygous GDF6
missense mutation were identified in the LCA/JRP cohort: A249E, A199T
(601147.0007), and E292D (601147.0009). Asai-Coakwell et al. (2013)
hypothesized that a second variant in the TGF-beta (see 190180) pathway
was present in the probands with a heterozygous GDF6 mutation, but exome
sequencing yielded incomplete coverage across open-reading frames of BMP
(see 112261) ligands, preventing identification of known heterozygous
mutations.

ANIMAL MODEL

Settle et al. (2003) found that Gdf5/Gdf6 double mutant mice survived to
birth in normal mendelian ratios, but only a small percentage survived
to adulthood. The double-mutant mice had skeletal defects not seen in
either Gdf5 or Gdf6 single mutants. Many limb bones were severely
reduced or absent, several limb joints failed to form, and the vertebral
column of 2 of 7 mice showed severe scoliosis.

Hanel and Hensey (2006) demonstrated in Xenopus that inhibition of gdf6
results in abnormalities in ocular development.

Asai-Coakwell et al. (2007) showed that inhibition of gdf6a in zebrafish
accurately recapitulated the phenotype of a proband with a chromosome
8q21.2-q22.1 segmental deletion and chorioretinal coloboma. The spectrum
of disorders generated by morpholino inhibition and the more severe
defects (microphthalmia and anophthalmia) observed at higher doses
illustrated the key role of GDF6 in ocular development. The results
underscored the usefulness of integrated clinical and molecular
investigation of patients with chromosomal anomalies.

Tassabehji et al. (2008) reported that knockdown of the Gdf6 gene in
Xenopus laevis resulted in axial and ocular defects. The most prevalent
phenotype of abnormal anterior axial alignments resulted in embryos with
head positions deviating in the vertical and lateral plane.

Asai-Coakwell et al. (2013) generated mice with a targeted deletion of
Gdf6 exon 2 and observed that heterozygotes exhibited abnormal
electroretinograms with up to 66% decreases in the bipolar cell-driven
b-wave and 54% decreases in the photoreceptor-mediated a-wave
amplitudes, as well as 3 to 27% reduced photopic flicker fusion,
findings compatible with a role for GDF6 in retinal function.
Examination of adult zebrafish homozygous for a Gdf6 S55X mutation
showed microphthalmia and misshapen irides. Histologic analysis of
homozygous mutants at 2 weeks of age demonstrated profound alterations
to the morphology of individual photoreceptor subtypes, including
red/green and UV cones. Actin and nuclear staining at later timepoints
revealed loss of normal retinal lamination, and immunohistochemistry
showed disorganization of Muller glial cells. Cone photoreceptors in
homozygous mutant adult zebrafish were consistently dysmorphic and
reduced in abundance. In addition, significantly increased retinal
apoptosis was observed in Gdf6 mutant mice and zebrafish compared to
wildtype animals; treatment of mutant zebrafish embryos with the
antiapoptotic compound P7C3 rescued the retinal apoptosis without
evidence of toxicity. Asai-Coakwell et al. (2013) stated that this was
the first evidence of perturbed TGF-beta (see 190180) signaling in
retinal disease.

GDF6, ALA249GLU

In affected members of a 3-generation family with autosomal dominant
Klippel-Feil syndrome (KFS1; 118100), Tassabehji et al. (2008)
identified a heterozygous 746C-A transversion in exon 2 of the GDF6
gene, resulting in an ala249-to-glu (A249E) substitution in the
prodomain. The mutation was not found in 708 control chromosomes. The
phenotype was characterized primarily by fusion of vertebral bodies C2
and C3. The authors suggested functional haploinsufficiency as the
pathogenetic mechanism.

Asai-Coakwell et al. (2009) screened the GDF6 gene in patients with
ocular and vertebral anomalies, and identified heterozygosity for the
A249E mutation in 2 probands, 1 of whom was a patient with isolated
microphthalmia (MCOP4; 613094). The other patient had coloboma and
postaxial polydactyly without vertebral defects, and her unaffected
mother also carried the mutation, demonstrating incomplete penetrance.
Functional studies showed significantly reduced reporter activity and
reduced levels of mature ligand with mutant GDF6 compared to wildtype,
indicating that A249E represents a hypomorphic mutation. The mutation
was not found in 366 controls.

In a female patient with Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA17; 615360),
Asai-Coakwell et al. (2013) identified compound heterozygosity for the
A249E mutation in the GDF6 gene and a c.169G-C transversion, resulting
in an asp57-to-his (D57H) substitution. The patient had vision limited
to detection of hand motions with an extinguished electroretinogram
(ERG) typical of the LCA phenotype; she did not have other ocular or
systemic phenotypes, but the authors noted that she had not undergone
radiologic imaging to detect milder GDF6-induced skeletal disease. Her
clinically unaffected mother, who was heterozygous for the A249E
mutation, exhibited a delayed rod b-wave implicit time on ERG;
similarly, her father, who was heterozygous for D57H, showed reduced
b-wave amplitude. The D57H mutation was absent from 1,500 control
chromosomes, whereas the A249E mutation was found in 4. Expression
analysis showed a 36% and 56% reduction in A249E mutant preproprotein
and mature ligand levels compared to wildtype, and reporter assays
showed that the A249E mutant has only 50% of wildtype activity. Levels
of D57H preproprotein and mature ligand were markedly reduced, with an
80% and 97% reduction in the cytosolic fraction, respectively, and a 97%
and 99% reduction in the media fraction; the D57H mutant had only 24% of
wildtype activity in reporter assays. Asai-Coakwell et al. (2013) also
identified heterozygosity for the A249E mutation in a female patient
from an LCA/juvenile retinitis pigmentosa cohort, who had inherited the
mutation from her unaffected father.

GDF6, LEU289PRO

In 2 unrelated patients with sporadic Klippel-Feil syndrome (KFS1;
118100), Tassabehji et al. (2008) identified a heterozygous 866T-C
transition in exon 2 of the GDF6 gene, resulting in a leu289-to-pro
(L289P) substitution in a conserved residue in the prodomain. The
mutation was not found in 708 control chromosomes. One patient was an
adult male with short neck, mirror movements, and left Sprengel anomaly.
The second patient was a fetus assessed following termination of
pregnancy for antenatal diagnosis of multiple segmentation abnormalities
affecting the entire spine and ribs, as well as multiple other
congenital anomalies.

GDF6, LYS242ARG

In a patient with hemivertebrae and rib malformations, or Klippel-Feil
syndrome (KFS1; 118100), Asai-Coakwell et al. (2009) identified
heterozygosity for a 1271A-G transition in exon 2 of the GDF6 gene,
predicted to result in a lys424-to-arg (K424R) substitution at a highly
conserved residue in the propeptide domain. Functional studies showed
significantly reduced reporter activity and reduced levels of mature
ligand with mutant GDF6 compared to wildtype, indicating that K424R
represents a hypomorphic mutation. The mutation was not found in 366
controls. The authors noted that in addition to skeletal anomalies, this
patient also had fused (horseshoe) kidney.

GDF6, GLY42VAL

In a patient with Klippel-Feil syndrome (KFS1; 118100), described as
spondylothoracic dysostosis, Asai-Coakwell et al. (2009) identified
heterozygosity for a 125G-T transversion in exon 1 of the GDF6 gene,
predicted to result in a gly42-to-val (G42V) substitution at a conserved
residue in the propeptide domain. The mutation was not found in 366
controls.

In a patient with isolated microphthalmia (613094), Asai-Coakwell et al.
(2009) identified heterozygosity for a 758A-T transversion in exon 1 of
the GDF6 gene, predicted to result in a gln253-to-leu (Q253L)
substitution at a conserved residue in the propeptide domain. The
mutation was found in the patient's unaffected mother, indicating
incomplete penetrance, but was not detected in 366 controls. The authors
noted that in addition to the eye findings, this patient had a single
testis.

In a patient with unilateral isolated microphthalmia (613094),
Asai-Coakwell et al. (2009) identified heterozygosity for a 980C-A
transversion in exon 2 of the GDF6 gene, predicted to result in a
pro327-to-his (P327H) substitution at a conserved residue in the
propeptide domain. The mutation was also found in the patient's father,
indicating incomplete penetrance, but was not detected in 366 controls.

Ye et al. (2010) described a European female with severe colobomatous
microphthalmia, bilateral iris coloboma, mixed horizontal and rotatory
nystagmus, bilateral foveal hypoplasia, and small optic discs with
reduced optic nerve diameter (MCOPCB6; 613703). They identified double
heterozygosity for an A199T mutation in the GDF6 gene and an R266C
mutation in the GDF3 gene (606522.0001). Her mildly affected mother was
heterozygous for the GDF3 mutation only. The authors suggested that
multiallelic inheritance of BMP variants may play a role in other
developmental disorders.

In a female proband diagnosed with Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA17;
615360), Asai-Coakwell et al. (2013) identified heterozygosity for the
A199T substitution in the GDF6 gene, inherited from her clinically
unaffected father. The mutation was not found in 650 control
chromosomes. Western blot showed a 47% and a 4% increase in expression
of the A199T mutant in the whole-cell lysate and media fractions,
respectively, compared to wildtype; however, reporter assays
demonstrated significantly reduced activation with the A199T mutant (56%
decrease) compared to wildtype.

also present in her clinically unaffected mother, but was not found in
1,500 control chromosomes. Western blot showed a 37% and a 56% increase
in expression of the E292D mutant in the whole-cell lysate and media

;;DENDRITIC CELL UBIQUITIN-LIKE PROTEIN; DCUBP;;
MGC30022
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

From large scale sequencing of a human dendritic cell cDNA library, Liu
et al. (2003) identified a novel ubiquitin-like protein, which they
designated dendritic cell-derived ubiquitin-like protein (DCUBP). The
deduced 106-amino acid DCUBP protein has a calculated molecular mass of
12.2 kD. Its UBQ domain shares 28.6% identity with that of ubiquitin
(see 191339); however, it does not possess the C-terminal Gly-Gly that
is required for ubiquitination, suggesting that it may not be involved
in protein degradation. Immunolocalization indicated that DCUBP
localizes to cytoplasm, especially in the mitochondrion. Using Northern
blot analysis and RT-PCR, Liu et al. (2003) observed no detectable DCUBP
bands in multiple human adult normal tissues. However, the DCUBP
transcript was enriched in multiple tumor cell lines, including A431,
MCF7, Lovo, HT29, PC-3, SMMC7721, and U251. Liu et al. (2003) found that
DCUBP expression was significantly decreased in tumor necrosis-related
apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)- and all-trans retinoid acid agonist
(ATRA)-stimulated HL60 cells. Liu et al. (2003) suggested that DCUBP may
be involved in TRAIL-induced apoptosis or retinoid acid receptor-alpha
signaling processes.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Liu et al. (2003) determined that the
UBTD2 gene maps to chromosome 5q35.

;;MANNOSIDASE, ALPHA B, LYSOSOMAL; MANB;;
LAMAN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Alpha-mannosidase (EC 3.2.1.24) is a lysosomal hydrolase that cleaves
alpha-linked mannose residues from the nonreducing end of N-linked
glycoproteins (Gotoda et al., 1998).

See also beta-mannosidase (MANBA; 609489).

CLONING

Nebes and Schmidt (1994) isolated and sequenced a cDNA for
alpha-mannosidase. Liao et al. (1996) used RT-PCR to clone 2 cDNAs
encoding human lysosomal alpha-mannosidase. The shorter of the 2 cDNAs
encodes a 3-kb open reading frame which, when expressed, produces a
functional alpha-mannosidase enzyme; the longer cDNA, encoding a 3.6-kb
open reading frame, produced no alpha-mannosidase activity when
expressed. Northern blot analysis identified a major 3-kb mRNA
transcript in all human tissues tested and a minor 3.6-kb mRNA
transcript in several adult tissues.

Nilssen et al. (1997) reported purification and characterization of
lysosomal alpha-mannosidase, which they symbolized LAMAN, from human
placenta. They found that the enzyme was synthesized as a single-chain
precursor which is processed into 3 glycopeptides of 70, 42, and 15 kD.
The 70-kD peptide is further partially proteolyzed into 3 more peptides
that are joined by disulfide bridges. The deduced amino acid sequence
contains a putative signal peptide of 48 amino acids followed by a
polypeptide sequence of 962 amino acids. Northern blot analysis revealed
a single transcript of approximately 3.5 kb present in all tissues
examined, but at varying levels.

Berg et al. (1997) reported the purification of feline liver lysosomal
alpha-mannosidase and determination of its cDNA sequence. The active
enzyme consists of 3 polypeptides, with molecular masses of 72, 41, and
12 kD, joined by noncovalent forces. They demonstrated that the enzyme
is synthesized as a single-chain precursor with a putative signal
peptide of 50 amino acids followed by a polypeptide chain of 957 amino
acids, which is cleaved into the 3 polypeptides of the mature enzyme.
The deduced amino acid sequence was 81.1% and 83.2% identical with the
human and bovine sequences, respectively. Tollersrud et al. (1997)
purified the bovine kidney enzyme to homogeneity and cloned the gene.

GENE STRUCTURE

Riise et al. (1997) determined that the MANB gene spans 21.5 kb and
contains 24 exons. By primer extension analysis, the major transcription
initiation sites were mapped to positions -309, -196, and -191 relative
to the first in-frame ATG. No CAAT or TATA sequences were identified
within the 134 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site, but the
5-prime flanking region contains several GC-rich regions with putative
binding sites for the transcription factors Sp1 (189906), AP-2 (107580),
and ETF.

MAPPING

By analysis of human-mouse hybrid cells, Kaneda et al. (1987) assigned
the MANB gene to chromosome 19p13.2-q12. By PCR analysis of DNA from 2
human/rodent somatic cell hybrid mapping panels, Nebes and Schmidt
(1994) mapped the MANB gene to the proximal portion of chromosome 19. In
combination with earlier findings, the gene could be mapped to
19cen-q12.

Beccari et al. (1996) mapped the mouse Man2b1 gene to chromosome 8 using
the Jackson Laboratory interspecific panel DNA.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 Palestinian sibs with alpha-mannosidosis (MANSA; 248500) originally
reported by Bach et al. (1978), Nilssen et al. (1997) identified a
homozygous mutation in the MAN2B1 gene (609458.0001).

In unrelated patients with alpha-mannosidosis, Gotoda et al. (1998)
identified 5 mutations in the MAN2B1 gene (609458.0001-609458.0005). All
mutations were either in the homozygous or compound heterozygous states.

In a screening of 43 patients with mannosidosis from 39 families, mainly
of European origin, Berg et al. (1999) identified 21 novel
disease-causing mutations in the MAN2B1 gene, and 4 polymorphic amino
acid variations. Disease-causing mutations were identified in 72% of the
patients' alleles and included 8 splicing, 6 missense, and 3 nonsense
mutations, as well as 2 small insertions and 2 small deletions. In
addition, Southern blot analysis indicated rearrangements in some
alleles. Most mutations were private or occurred in 2 or 3 families,
except for the R750W substitution (609458.0004), which was found in 13
patients from different European countries and accounted for 21% of the
disease alleles. No correlation between the types of mutations and the
clinical manifestations was evident.

Riise Stensland et al. (2012) identified 96 different pathogenic
mutations in the MAN2B1 gene, including 83 novel mutations, in 130
unrelated patients with alpha-mannosidosis from 30 countries. Most of
the mutations were private, but R750W was found in 50 patients from 16
countries and accounted for 27.3% of disease alleles. Haplotype analysis
indicated at least 4 independent events causing R750W, with 1 haplotype
accounting for 95% of the alleles. Population-based analysis suggested
that the mutant allele arose in eastern Europe. Other recurrent
mutations included a splice site mutation in intron 14 (609458.0006),
found in 13 disease alleles, and L809P (609458.0007), found in 8 disease
alleles. Twenty-nine novel missense mutations were identified. Most did
not show any residual enzyme activity when expressed in COS7 cells, but
10 showed some activity, including 5 with 30% or more residual activity.
There were no apparent genotype/phenotype correlations.

ANIMAL MODEL

Roces et al. (2004) reported correction of storage of neutral
oligosaccharides in a mouse model of alpha-mannosidosis after
intravenous administration of Man2b1 from bovine kidney and human and
mouse recombinant MAN2B1. The bovine and human enzymes were barely
phosphorylated, whereas the bulk of the mouse Man2b1 contained mannose
6-phosphate recognition markers. Clearance and apparent half-life of the
internalized enzyme was dependent on the enzyme source as well as tissue
type. The corrective effect was time-, tissue- and dose-dependent, and
the effects were observed to be transient. After a single dose injection
of MAN2B1, the maximum corrective effect was observed between 2 and 6
days. Injection of 250 microU of human MAN2B1 per gram of body weight
followed by a subsequent injection 3.5 days later was sufficient to
clear liver, kidney, and heart of neutral oligosaccharides. A decrease
in mannose-containing oligosaccharides was also observed in the brain,
with storage levels in treated mice less than 30% of levels found in
control mice.

Blanz et al. (2008) demonstrated that the neuropathology of a mouse
model for alpha-mannosidosis could be efficiently treated using
recombinant human alpha-mannosidase (rhLAMAN). After intravenous
administration of various doses (25-500 U/kg), rhLAMAN was widely
distributed among tissues, and immunohistochemistry revealed lysosomal
delivery of the injected enzyme. Whereas low doses (25 U/kg) led to a
greater than 70% clearance of stored substrates in visceral tissues and
doses of 250 U/kg were sufficient for clearance in peripheral neurons of
the trigeminal ganglion, repeated high-dose injections (500 U/kg) were
required to achieve a greater than 50% reduction of brain storage.
Successful transfer across the blood-brain barrier was evident as the
injected enzyme was found in hippocampal neurons, leading to nearly
complete disappearance of storage vacuoles. In addition, the decrease in
neuronal storage in the brain correlated with an improvement of the
neuromotor disabilities found in untreated alpha-mannosidosis mice.
Uptake of rhLAMAN seemed to be independent of mannose-6-phosphate
receptors, consistent with the low phosphorylation profile of the
enzyme.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ALPHA-MANNOSIDOSIS
MAN2B1, HIS71LEU

In 2 sibs with alpha-mannosidosis (MANSA; 248500), born of
consanguineous parents, Nilssen et al. (1997) identified a homozygous
212A-T transversion in exon 2 of the MANB gene, resulting in a
his71-to-leu (H71L) substitution. Residue his71 is conserved among
lysosomal alpha-mannosidases from several species. The sibs were thought
to be mildly affected and residual acidic alpha-mannosidase activity of
20% of normal was detected in the patient's fibroblasts, according to
the report of this family by Bach et al. (1978). Nevertheless, the
patients showed vacuolated leukocytes and fibroblasts consistent with
the disease phenotype. The authors suggested that mutant mannosidase
enzymes, even though containing residual activity upon testing at the
appropriate pH, may be mislocalized to nonlysosomal compartments and
therefore functionally inactive.

Gotoda et al. (1998) identified the same mutation, which they designated
HIS72LEU in keeping with the codon numbering system of Wakamatsu et al.
(1997). The patient, represented by cell line GM2051, was one of the
patients reported by Nilssen et al. (1997).

.0002
ALPHA-MANNOSIDOSIS
MAN2B1, ARG760TER

In a 47-year-old Japanese woman with mannosidosis (248500), born to
first-cousin parents, Gotoda et al. (1998) identified a homozygous
C-to-T transition in exon 19 of the MAN2B1 gene, resulting in an
arg760-to-ter (R760X) substitution. The lysosomal alpha-mannosidase
activity of the peripheral leukocytes was decreased to less than 1% of
control values.

.0003
ALPHA-MANNOSIDOSIS
MAN2B1, GLN639TER

In fibroblast cell lines from a 7-year-old Finnish boy with
alpha-mannosidosis (248500), who was originally described by Autio et
al. (1973), Gotoda et al. (1998) identified compound heterozygosity for
2 mutations in the MAN2B1 gene: a C-to-T transition in exon 15,
resulting in a gln639-to-ter (Q639X) substitution, and a C-to-T
transition in exon 18, resulting in an arg750-to-trp substitution
(R750W; 609458.0004). Alpha-mannosidase activity was reduced to
approximately 2% of normal.

.0004
ALPHA-MANNOSIDOSIS
MAN2B1, ARG750TRP

See 609458.0003 and Gotoda et al. (1998).

Berg et al. (1999) identified the arg750-to-trp (R750W) mutation in 13
patients with alpha-mannosidosis (248500) from different European
countries. R750W accounted for 21% of disease alleles.

Riise Stensland et al. (2012) identified the R750W mutation in 50 of 130
unrelated patients with alpha-mannosidosis from 30 countries. It was the
most common mutation, accounting for 27.3% of disease alleles. Haplotype
analysis indicated at least 4 independent events causing R750W, with 1
haplotype accounting for 95% of the alleles. Population-based analysis
suggested that the mutant allele arose in eastern Europe. The mutation
was found in patients with mild, moderate, and severe disease.

.0005
ALPHA-MANNOSIDOSIS
MAN2B1, PRO356ARG

In a fibroblast cell line from a 2-year-old girl with severe
alpha-mannosidosis (248500), Gotoda et al. (1998) identified a
homozygous C-to-T transversion in exon 8 of the MAN2B1 gene, resulting
in a pro356-to-arg (P356R) substitution. The patient showed severe
growth failure with hypotonia, psychomotor retardation, and
hepatosplenomegaly.

.0006
ALPHA-MANNOSIDOSIS
MAN2B1, IVS14DS, G-C, +1

In a study of 130 unrelated patients with alpha-mannosidosis (248500)
from 30 countries, Riise Stensland et al. (2012) found that a G-to-C
transversion in intron 14 (IVS14+1G-C) of the MAN2B1 gene (Berg et al.,
1999) was present on 13 disease alleles, making it the second most
common mutation after R750W (609458.0004).

.0007
ALPHA-MANNOSIDOSIS
MAN2B1, LEU809PRO

In a study of 130 unrelated patients with alpha-mannosidosis (248500)
from 30 countries, Riise Stensland et al. (2012) found that a 2426T-C
transition in exon 20 of the MAN2B1 gene (Berg et al., 1999) was present
on 8 disease alleles, making it the third most common mutation after
R750W (609458.0004) and a splice site mutation in intron 14
(609458.0006).

605466	TITLE *605466 SIGNAL REGULATORY PROTEIN, GAMMA; SIRPG
;;SIRP-GAMMA;;
SIGNAL REGULATORY PROTEIN, BETA-2; SIRPB2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Ichigotani et al. (2000) isolated from a human placenta cDNA library a
full-length cDNA encoding SIRPG, which they called SIRPB2. The 354-amino
acid protein shares approximately 75% sequence identity with SIRPB1
(603889). It possesses a putative signal sequence, a long extracellular
domain, a transmembrane region, a short intracellular domain, and no
catalytic domain. RT-PCR analysis detected expression of SIRPG at
varying levels in all tissues tested.

By EST database analysis, Brooke et al. (2004) identified 2 SIRPG
variants. Variant 1 contains all 6 exons and encodes a protein with an
N-terminal Ig-like V domain and 2 Ig-like C domains. Variant-2 lacks
exons 3 and 4, which encode the 2 Ig-like C domains.

GENE FUNCTION

Brooke et al. (2004) expressed the extracellular region of SIRPG as a
soluble protein. BIAcore analysis showed that SIRPG bound CD47 (601028),
but at a lower affinity than SIRPA (PTPNS1; 602461), and it induced
apoptosis. Binding was enhanced in activated peripheral blood
mononuclear cells compared with resting cells. ELISA, flow cytometric,
and immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated that SIRPG was expressed
on the surface of most T cells and some B cells. Surface expression of
SIRPG occurred in the presence or absence of DAP12 (TYROBP; 604142), in
contrast to SIRPB1, which requires coexpression of DAP12 for surface
expression. Brooke et al. (2004) stated that SIRPG lacks a lysine in its
transmembrane region required for DAP12 interaction.

GENE STRUCTURE

Brooke et al. (2004) determined that the SIRPG gene contains 6 exons.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid analysis, Ichigotani et al.
(2000) mapped the SIRPG gene to chromosome 20p13 near the marker
D20S906.

600713	TITLE *600713 11-@BETA-HYDROXYSTEROID DEHYDROGENASE, TYPE I; HSD11B1
;;HSD11L
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

There are at least 2 isoforms of 11-beta-HSD. The first discovered,
HSD11B1, was purified (Lakshmi and Monder, 1988) and cloned (Agarwal et
al., 1989) from rat liver. This glycoprotein enzyme (also called type I)
catalyzes both 11-beta-dehydrogenation and the reverse 11-oxoreduction
reaction. The enzyme and corresponding mRNA have been detected in a wide
range of rat and human tissues, including liver, lung, and testis. The
other isoform, type II, is expressed predominantly in the kidney and
placenta and catalyzes only the 11-beta-dehydrogenation reaction; see
HSD11B2 (614232).

Tannin et al. (1991) isolated human cDNA clones encoding
11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type I from a testis cDNA library
by hybridization with the previously isolated rat 11-HSD cDNA clone. The
cDNA contained an open reading frame of 876 nucleotides, which predicted
a protein of 292 amino acids. The sequence was 77% identical at the
amino acid level to the rat 11-HSD. The mRNA was widely expressed but
the level of expression was highest in the liver.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tannin et al. (1991) determined that the HSD11B1 gene consists of 6
exons and is at least 9 kb long.

MAPPING

By hybridization of the human cDNA to a human/hamster hybrid cell panel,
Tannin et al. (1991) localized the HSD11B1 gene to chromosome 1. The
localization was confirmed by isolating the gene from a chromosome
1-specific library using the cDNA as a probe. By genomic sequence
analysis, Schutte et al. (2000) mapped the HSD11B1 gene to 1q32-q41.

GENE FUNCTION

Ricketts et al. (1998) studied the localization of this isozyme, using
an antibody raised in sheep against amino acids 19-33 of human
11-beta-HSD1. 11-Beta-HSD1 immunoreactivity was observed more intensely
around the hepatic central vein, with no staining around the portal
vein, hepatic artery, or bile ducts. Whereas no staining for
11-beta-HSD1 was seen in the adrenal medulla, immunoreactive protein was
observed in all 3 zones of the adrenal cortex (greatest in the zona
reticularis, less in the zona glomerulosa, and least in the zona
fasciculata). In the human ovary, immunoreactivity was observed in the
developing oocyte and the luteinized granulosa cells of the corpus
luteum. No staining was observed in granulosa cells, thecal cells, or
ovarian stroma, which contrasted with the marked expression of
11-beta-HSD2 in the granulosa cell layer. Sections of human decidua
showed high expression of 11-beta-HSD1 in decidual cells. In omental
adipose tissue, 11-beta-HSD1 immunoreactivity was observed in both
stromal and adipocyte cells.

Work by Nikkila et al. (1993) indicated that the liver isozyme HSD11B1
is probably not the cause of apparent mineralocorticoid excess with
hypertension. Further studies by Mune et al. (1995) demonstrated that
this syndrome is due to mutations in the kidney/placental isozyme (type
II) of HSD11 (HSD11B2).

Draper et al. (2002) studied the microsatellites CA19 and CA15 from DNA
of 413 normal individuals enrolled in the MONICA study of cardiovascular
risk factors and 557 Danish men (ADIGEN study), of whom 234 were obese
(BMI greater than or equal to 31 kg/m2) at draft board exam and 323 were
randomly selected controls from the draftee population with BMI below 31
kg/m2. No association was observed between HSD11B1 genotype and BMI in
either population. These data suggested that 11-beta-HSD1 is not a major
factor in explaining genetic susceptibility to obesity per se. However,
weak associations between HSD11B1 genotype, increased 11-beta-HSD1
activity, and waist-to-hip ratio suggested that polymorphic variability
at the HSD11B1 locus may influence susceptibility to central obesity
through enhanced 11-beta-HSD1 activity (cortisone to cortisol
conversion) in visceral adipose tissue.

Individual susceptibility to glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis is
difficult to predict clinically. The findings of Cooper et al. (2003)
suggested that measures of HSD11B1 activity may predict individual
susceptibility to glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis.

To test the hypothesis that HSD11B1 expression would increase in fetal
membranes during pregnancy and at labor, creating the potential for
local increase in cortisol production at term, Alfaidy et al. (2003)
examined HSD11B1 expression in placenta and fetal membranes obtained
during normal pregnancy from 6 nonlaboring women from uncomplicated term
pregnancies after elective cesarean section. At term, immunoreactive
HSD11B1 expression was localized predominantly to the chorion
trophoblast cells, attached deciduas, and amnion epithelial cells.
HSD11B1 expression in fetal membranes increased with gestational age and
reflected increased enzyme reductase activity. No change in HSD11B1
expression was found in placental tissue from the same patients. There
was a significant increase in HSD11B1 expression in amnion but not in
chorion with the onset of labor. Alfaidy et al. (2003) suggested that
increases in HSD11B1 expression/activity by intrauterine membranes
during late gestation may result in increased potential for a local
increase in cortisol production and that fetal membranes should be
considered as an extraadrenal source of cortisol during late gestation.
This local cortisol production may be involved in different pathways
contributing to the regulation of parturition.

Sandeep et al. (2004) showed that 11-beta-HSD1, but not 11-beta-HSD2,
mRNA is expressed in the human hippocampus, frontal cortex, and
cerebellum.

GENE FAMILY

Agarwal et al. (1995) compared the genes encoding the liver and kidney
isozymes, which they symbolized HSD11L and HSD11K, respectively. HSD11K
has 5 exons; HSD11L has 6 exons. The coding sequences of these genes are
only 21% identical. In vitro, the NAD(+)-dependent kidney (type 2)
isozyme catalyzes 11-beta-dehydrogenase but not reductase reactions,
whereas the NADP(+)-dependent liver (type 1) isozyme catalyzes both
reactions.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Cortisone Reductase Deficiency 2

In cortisone reductase deficiency (614662), activation of cortisone to
cortisol does not occur, suggesting a defect in the HSD11B1 gene because
11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 is a primary regulator of
tissue-specific glucocorticoid bioavailability. In vivo, 11-beta-HSD1
catalyzes the reduction of cortisone to cortisol, whereas purified
enzyme acts as a dehydrogenase, converting cortisol to cortisone.
Oxoreductase activity can be regained via an NADPH-regeneration system
involving the cytosolic enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD;
305900); however, because the catalytic domain of 11-beta-HSD1 faces
into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Draper et al. (2003)
hypothesized that the endolumenal hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
(H6PD; 138090) regenerates NADPH in the ER, thereby influencing
directionality of 11-beta-HSD1 activity. Draper et al. (2003) identified
variation in the HSD11B1 gene that was later shown to be polymorphism
(see 600713.0001). The patients of Draper et al. (2003) carried
causative mutations in the H6PD gene (see CORTRD1, 604931).

In 2 young boys with a mild form of cortisone reductase deficiency, in
whom no mutations were detected in the H6PD gene (138090), Lawson et al.
(2011) identified heterozygosity for 2 different missense mutations in
the HSD11B1 gene (600713.0002 and 600713.0003). The mutations were
inherited from their mothers, who had similar biochemical profiles.
Expression of the mutants in bacterial and mammalian cells greatly
reduced or abolished HSD11B1 activity.

- Association with Alzheimer Disease Risk

Because glucocorticoid excess increases neuronal vulnerability, genetic
variations in the glucocorticoid system may be related to the risk for
Alzheimer disease (AD; 104300). De Quervain et al. (2004) analyzed SNPs
in 10 glucocorticoid-related genes in 351 AD patients and 463 unrelated
control subjects. Set-association analysis revealed that a rare
haplotype in the 5-prime regulatory region of the HSD11B1 gene was
associated with a 6-fold increased risk for sporadic AD. In a
reporter-gene assay, the rare risk-associated haplotype reduced HSD11B1
transcription by 20% compared with the common haplotype. De Quervain et
al. (2004) concluded that a functional variation in the glucocorticoid
system increases risk for AD.

OTHER FEATURES

In aging humans and rodents, interindividual differences in cognitive
function have been ascribed to variations in long-term glucocorticoid
exposure. In human populations, including those with Cushing disease
(see 219080), Alzheimer disease (see 104300), depression, and normal
aging, higher cortisol levels have been associated with poorer memory
and hippocampal shrinkage/neuronal loss. 11-Beta-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase type 1 regenerates the active glucocorticoid cortisol from
circulating inert cortisone, thus amplifying intracellular
glucocorticoid levels in some tissues. Sandeep et al. (2004) showed that
11-beta-HSD1, but not 11-beta-HSD2, mRNA is expressed in the human
hippocampus, frontal cortex, and cerebellum. In 2 randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover studies, administration of
the 11-beta-HSD inhibitor carbenoxolone improved verbal fluency after 4
weeks in 10 healthy elderly males and improved verbal memory after 6
weeks in 12 patients with type II diabetes (125853). Although
carbenoxolone had been reported to enhance hepatic insulin sensitivity
in short-term studies (Walker et al., 1995; Andrews et al., 2003), there
was no change in glycemic control or serum lipid profile, nor was plasma
cortisol altered. Sandeep et al. (2004) suggested that 11-beta-HSD1
inhibition may be an approach to prevent or ameliorate cognitive
decline.

11-Beta-HSD1 is a promising target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes
mellitus because of its role in the cortisone-to-cortisol conversion in
visceral adipose tissue. The nonselective 11-beta-HSD inhibitor
carbenoxolone had been found not clinically viable because of adverse
effects associated with inhibition of 11-beta-HSD2 (see 218030),
including cortisol-dependent mineralocorticoid excess and hypokalemic
alkalosis. Courtney et al. (2008) tested the safety, tolerability,
pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of PF-00915275, a selective
11-beta-HSD1 inhibitor, in 60 healthy adult volunteers. They reported
that PF-00915275 was well tolerated across all doses studied for up to 2
weeks, and that prednisolone generation tests and ratios of urinary
corticosteroid metabolites are useful markers of 11-beta-HSD1
inhibition.

ANIMAL MODEL

Masuzaki et al. (2001) created transgenic mice overexpressing
11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 selectively in adipose
tissue to an extent similar to that found in adipose tissue from obese
humans. These mice had increased adipose levels of corticosterone and
developed visceral obesity that was exaggerated by a high-fat diet. The
mice also exhibited pronounced insulin-resistant diabetes,
hyperlipidemia, and, surprisingly, hyperphagia despite hyperleptinemia.
Increased adipocyte 11-beta-hydroxysteroid type 1 activity may be a
common molecular etiology for visceral obesity and the metabolic
syndrome.

Kotelevtsev et al. (1997) generated mice carrying a targeted disruption
of 11-beta-HSD1. Homozygous null mice were unable to regenerate
corticosterone from inert 11-dehydrocorticosterone. They observed
attenuated gluconeogenic responses upon stress and resistance to
hyperglycemia induced by chronic high-fat feeding. The authors concluded
that 11-beta-HSD1 activity is an important amplifier of intrahepatic
glucocorticoid action in vivo.

Morton et al. (2001) investigated liver-dependent changes in lipid and
lipoprotein metabolism in Hsd11b1 knockout mice (Kotelevtsev et al.
(1997)). By measuring circulating levels of lipids and lipoproteins,
Morton et al. (2001) observed lower plasma triglyceride levels,
increased HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein AI levels in
Hsd11b1-deficient mice. Using Northern blot analysis, they detected
exaggerated induction of genes encoding lipogenic enzymes and a marked
suppression of genes for fat catabolism in Hsd11b1-null mice after
fasting and refeeding. By measuring plasma glucose levels after fasting
and refeeding, the authors determined that Hsd11b1-null mice have
improved glucose tolerance. Morton et al. (2001) concluded that HSD11B1
deficiency produces an improved metabolic profile characterized by
increased lipid catabolism, increased hepatic insulin sensitivity, and
reduced intracellular glucocorticoid concentrations.

Paterson et al. (2004) produced transgenic mice overexpressing Hsd11b1
selectively in liver. Transgenic animals with 2- and 5-fold elevated
liver Hsd11b1 activity exhibited mild insulin resistance without altered
fat depot mass. They showed fatty liver and dyslipidemia with increased
hepatic lipid synthesis/flux associated with elevated Lxra (602423) and
Ppara (170998) mRNA levels as well as impaired hepatic lipid clearance.
The transgenic mice also exhibited transgene dose-associated
hypertension and liver angiotensinogen expression.

In studies of angiogenesis in mice using an in vitro aortic ring model
and in vivo subcutaneously implanted polyurethane sponges, Small et al.
(2005) found that glucocorticoids administered at physiologic
concentrations inhibited angiogenesis. Blocking endogenous
glucocorticoid action with the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist
RU38486 enhanced angiogenesis in subcutaneous sponges, in healing
surgical wounds, and in the myocardium of mice 7 days after
ligation-induced myocardial infarction. Hsd11b1-null mice showed
enhanced angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo within sponges, wounds, and
infarcted myocardium. Small et al. (2005) concluded that HSD11B1
amplifies the angiostatic effect of glucocorticoids by regenerating
active glucocorticoids locally and thereby constrains the angiogenic
response after ischemia and injury.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RECLASSIFIED - VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
HSD11B1, 1-BP INS, 83557A AND 83597T-G (dbSNP rs45487298 AND dbSNP
rs12086634)

This variant, formerly titled CORTISONE REDUCTASE DEFICIENCY, has been
reclassified based on the findings of San Millan et al. (2005), White
(2005), Draper et al. (2006), and Smit et al. (2007).

In 3 unrelated individuals with cortisone reductase deficiency (CRD)
(see 614662), Draper et al. (2003) identified triallelic digenic
inheritance of mutations in the HSD11B1 and H6PD (138090) genes. All 3
patients were either homozygous or heterozygous with respect to 2
mutations in intron 3 of HSD11B1 that were in complete linkage
disequilibrium: an A insertion at position 83557 (83557insA) and a
T-to-G transversion 40 bp downstream at position 83597 (83597T-G). In
each kindred, at least 1 parent was heterozygous with respect to this
genotype. The allele frequency of the 83557insA/83597T-G haplotype was
14% in control populations. Luciferase reporter assays using mRNA from 1
of the patients demonstrated that transcriptional activity of mutant
constructs was 2.5 times lower than that of controls. In addition,
sequencing of H6PD identified mutations in exon 5 in all 3 patients (see
138090.0001 and 138090.0002). Draper et al. (2003) concluded that CRD
defines a new endoplasmic reticulum-specific redox potential and
establishes H6PD as a potential factor in the pathogenesis of polycystic
ovary syndrome (PCOS; 184700).

Because the phenotype of CRD resembles that of PCOS, San Millan et al.
(2005) investigated the R453Q variant of H6PD (138090.0002) and the
83557insA variant of HSD11B1 in 116 patients with PCOS and 76
nonhyperandrogenic controls. Four controls and 5 patients presented 3 of
4 mutant alleles of H6PD R453Q and HSD11B1 83557insA, which is the
genotype observed in some subjects with CRD. Estimates of 11-beta-HSD
oxoreductase activity were measured in 6 of these 9 women, ruling out
CRD. Patients homozygous for the R453 allele, which was more frequent in
PCOS patients, presented with increased cortisol and
17-hydroxyprogesterone levels compared with carriers of Q453 alleles;
these differences were not observed in controls. HSD11B1 83557insA
genotypes were not associated with PCOS and did not influence any
phenotypic variable. San Millan et al. (2005) concluded that digenic
triallelic genotypes of the H6PD R453Q variant and HSD11B1 83557insA
mutation do not always cause CRD.

In a population-based association study, White (2005) genotyped 3,551
individuals for the 83597T-G polymorphism in intron 3 of the HSD11B1
gene and the R453Q polymorphism in the H6PD gene. Both polymorphisms
occurred more frequently than previously reported, with the so-called
apparent CRD (ACRD) genotypes (at least 3 of 4 minor alleles present)
occurring in 7% of subjects. There were no associations between genotype
and body mass index; waist/hip ratio; visceral adiposity; measures of
insulin sensitivity; levels of testosterone, FSH, or LH (in females); or
risk of PCOS. In addition, there was no genotype effect on urinary free
cortisol/cortisone or corticosteroid metabolite ratios, which were
measured in 10 subjects, each carrying 0, 3, or 4 minor alleles. White
(2005) concluded that previously reported associations of ACRD with
HSD11B1 and H6PD alleles represented ascertainment bias, but noted that
rare severe mutations in these genes cannot be ruled out.

In a case-control study involving 256 nuclear families ascertained from
PCOS offspring, 213 singleton cases, and 549 controls, Draper et al.
(2006) analyzed CRD-related variants in the HSD11B1 (83597T-G; dbSNP
rs12086634) and H6PD (R453Q; dbSNP rs6688832) genes but found no
differences in genotype distribution between PCOS cases and controls.
Draper et al. (2006) concluded that the variants do not influence
susceptibility to PCOS and, noting that the genotype combination
previously implicated in the development of CRD had a similar prevalence
in PCOS patients and controls, they suggested that it was likely that
additional variants within these genes are required for the development
of CRD.

Smit et al. (2007) analyzed the 83557insA polymorphism in the HSD11B1
gene and the R453Q polymorphism in H6PD in 6,452 elderly Caucasian
individuals from 2 population-based cohorts and found no association
between genotype distribution or combined genotypes on body mass index,
adrenal androgen production, waist-to-hip ratio, systolic and diastolic
blood pressure, fasting glucose levels, glucose tolerance test, or
incidence of dementia (see 600274). Given the high frequency of the 2
polymorphisms in these 2 Caucasian populations, with 3.8% and 4.0%
carrying at least 3 affected alleles, respectively, Smit et al. (2007)
concluded that it was very unlikely that these SNPs interact to cause
CRD.

.0002
CORTISONE REDUCTASE DEFICIENCY 2
HSD11B1, ARG137CYS

In an 8-year-old boy with a mild form of cortisone reductase deficiency
(CORTRD2; 614662), Lawson et al. (2011) identified heterozygosity for a
409C-T transition in exon 4 of the HSD11B1 gene, resulting in an
arg137-to-cys (R137C) substitution. The mutation alters a highly
conserved residue on the edge of the dimer interface that forms a salt
bridge with another highly conserved residue on the other subunit. The
proband's mother, who had a biochemical profile similar to that of her
son, was also heterozygous for the R137C mutation, which was not found
in 120 control chromosomes. Transfection studies in HEK293 cells
demonstrated that the R137C mutant produced only 5% of wildtype
activity, and expression in a bacterial system yielded 6-fold less
soluble protein than wildtype, suggestive of interference with subunit
folding or dimer assembly. Simultaneous expression of the R137C mutant
and wildtype HSD11B1 in bacterial or mammalian cells, to simulate the
heterozygous condition, indicated a marked suppressive effect of the
mutant on the yield and activity of HSD11B1 dimers, consistent with a
dominant-negative effect.

.0003
CORTISONE REDUCTASE DEFICIENCY 2
HSD11B1, LYS187ASN

In a 13-year-old boy with a mild form of cortisone reductase deficiency
(CORTRD2; 614662), Lawson et al. (2011) identified heterozygosity for a
561G-T transversion in exon 5 of the HSD11B1 gene, resulting in a
lys187-to-asn (K187N) substitution at a highly conserved residue in the
core catalytic tetrad required for enzyme activity. The proband's
mother, who had a biochemical profile similar to that of her son, was
also heterozygous for the K187N mutation, which was not found in 120
control chromosomes. No enzyme activity could be detected when the K187N
mutant was expressed in either bacterial or mammalian cells, and in the
bacterial system, no soluble protein could be detected at all,
suggesting the importance of this residue to structural stability.
Simultaneous expression of the K187N mutant and wildtype HSD11B1 in
bacterial or mammalian cells, to simulate the heterozygous condition,
indicated a marked suppressive effect of the mutant on the yield and
activity of HSD11B1 dimers, consistent with a dominant-negative effect.

611297	TITLE *611297 ODD-SKIPPED-RELATED 2; OSR2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

OSR2 is a mammalian homolog of the Drosophila odd-skipped family of
transcription factors (Lan et al., 2004).

CLONING

By database searching with mouse Osr1 (608891) as query Lan et al (2001)
identified human OSR2. They subsequently cloned mouse Osr2, which
encodes a 276-amino acid protein. Northern blot analysis detected Osr2
in mouse embryonic RNA. In situ hybridization detected Osr2 expression
in a dynamic pattern during craniofacial, limb, and kidney development
with expression first detected at embryonic day (E) 9.5 in the
mesonephric vesicles, followed by expression in the mesenchyme adjacent
to the maxillary processes. In developing limb buds, Osr2 expression
follows a distinct dorsal to ventral developmental time sequence. Mouse
Osr2 was expressed at sites of epithelial-mesenchyme interaction during
tooth and kidney development. Osr2 shares 65% amino acid identity with
Osr1 and 98% identity over the zinc finger domains.

Kawai et al. (2005) cloned mouse splice variants Osr2a and Osr2b
containing 312 and 276 amino acids, respectively, and differing by an
additional C-terminal sequence in Osr2a. Osr2a contains 5 predicted zinc
finger domains, while Osr2b contains 3 zinc finger domains. Database
analysis confirmed the presence of 2 splice variants in rat and human.
PCR analysis of Osr2 splice variant expression in mouse tissues detected
both transcripts in kidney, muscle, testis, and mouse embryos with weak
expression in the lung. The ratio of Osr2a to Osr2b varied in the
tissues tested, with Osr2b predominantly transcribed.
Immunocytochemistry studies in COS-7 cells expressing Osr2a and Osr2b
localized both isoforms to the nucleus.

GENE FUNCTION

Using transcriptional activity studies with Gal4 fusions and luciferase
assay systems, Kawai et al. (2005) showed that both Osr2 variants affect
transcriptional activity, with the 2 variants expressing opposite
transcriptional activities. Osr2a repressed transcriptional activity,
and Osr2b activated transcription. In the luciferase assay, the opposite
results were obtained with Osr2a activating and Osr2b repressing
transcription.

MAPPING

Lan et al. (2004) stated that the OSR2 gene mapped to chromosome 8q23,
which Prescott et al. (2000) reported as a region associated with
nonsyndromic orofacial clefting.

Kawai et al. (2005) mapped the mouse Osr2 gene to mouse chromosome 15.

ANIMAL MODEL

Lan et al. (2004) generated mice with target disruption of Osr2.
Homozygous mutant mice displayed complete embryogenesis but died within
24 hours of birth. All homozygous mutant mice exhibited open eyelids,
bilateral cleft of the secondary palate, and thickened tympanic rings.
No abnormalities of kidney or limb development were detected. Histologic
analysis of mutant mice showed early normal palatal growth and initial
downward palatal outgrowth. However, between embryonic days 13.5 and
14.5, homozygous mutant mice displayed retarded palatal shelves that
remained vertically oriented rather than the normal rapid growth and
reorientation to a horizontal position detected in wildtype and
heterozygous mutant embryos. During continued normal development,
palatal shelves initiate fusion at the midline by embryonic day 15.5;
however, homozygous mutant mice showed no fusion of palatal shelves,
resulting in bilateral cleft of the secondary palate at birth.
Homozygous mutant mice exhibited a 26% reduction in palatal cell
proliferation at embryonic day 13.5. In situ hybridization showed that
the palatal mesenchyme proliferation defect in the homozygous mutant
mice was correlated with the spatiotemporal downregulation of Osr1
expression. Homozygous mutant mice displayed altered mRNA expression and
spatial distribution of Osr1, Tgfb3 (190230), and Pax9 (167416) during
palate development. Lan et al. (2004) concluded that Osr2 acts as a
regulator of palatal growth and patterning.

Zhang et al. (2009) observed that Osr2 -/- embryos exhibited
supernumerary tooth development lingual to their molar teeth. Because
Osr2 -/- mice die shortly after birth, Zhang et al. (2009) transplanted
embryonic day-13.5 mandibular molar tooth germs under renal capsules of
adult mice to allow complete tooth morphogenesis. After 21 days,
wildtype and Osr2 +/- molar tooth germs gave rise to 2 or 3 mineralized
molar teeth, whereas Osr2 -/- mutant molar tooth germs gave rise to 4 or
5 mineralized teeth. In the developing tooth mesenchyme of wildtype
embryos, Osr2 was expressed in a lingual-to-buccal gradient that was
complementary to the expression pattern of Bmp4 (112262), an essential
odontogenic signal. In Osr2 -/- embryos, expression of several ontogenic
factors, including Pitx2 (601542), Shh (600725), Msx1 (142983), and Lef1
(153245), was spatially expanded or upregulated compared with expression
in wildtype embryos. Msx1 -/- Osr2 -/- double-mutant embryos showed
largely normalized tooth development, suggesting that expansion of the
odontogenic field in Osr2 -/- embryos required Msx1, a feedback
activator of Bmp4. Zhang et al. (2009) concluded that MSX1 and OSR2 act
antagonistically to pattern the tooth morphogenic field by controlling
the expression and spatial distribution of mesenchymal odontogenic
signals along the buccolingual axis.

607233	TITLE *607233 MAS-RELATED G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR FAMILY, MEMBER F; MRGPRF
;;MRGF;;
RAT THORACIC ARTERY PROTEIN, HOMOLOG OF; RTA
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Ross et al. (1990) cloned rat Mrgprf, which they called Rta. The deduced
343-amino acid protein has 7 transmembrane domains and is most closely
related to the human MAS1 oncogene (165180), with which it shares 34%
amino acid identity.

Dong et al. (2001) identified, in the mouse and human genomes, a family
of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) related to the MAS1 oncogene,
including MRGPRF, which they called MRGF. Several pseudogenes were also
identified. The predicted MRG proteins contain transmembrane,
extracellular, and cytoplasmic domains. A subset of MRGs was expressed
in specific subpopulations of sensory neurons that detect painful
stimuli. The expression patterns of these genes thus revealed an
unexpected degree of molecular diversity among nociceptive neurons. Some
MRGs could be specifically activated in heterologous cells by RFamide
neuropeptides, such as NPFF and NPAF (see 604643), which are analgesic
in vivo. The authors concluded that MRGs may regulate nociceptor
function and/or development, including the sensation or modulation of
pain.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Dong et al. (2001) mapped the MRGF gene to
chromosome 11.

120070	TITLE *120070 COLLAGEN, TYPE IV, ALPHA-3; COL4A3
;;COLLAGEN OF BASEMENT MEMBRANE, ALPHA-3 CHAIN
TUMSTATIN, INCLUDED;;
GOODPASTURE ANTIGEN, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Type IV collagen is found only in basement membranes, where it is the
major structural component. COL4A3 is 1 of 6 alpha chains that form the
heterotrimeric type IV collagen molecules. Tumstatin, a peptide fragment
derived from the C-terminal noncollagenous (NC1) domain of COL4A3, has
antiangiogenic activity. The NC1 domain of COL4A3 has also been referred
to as the Goodpasture antigen, since it is the primary target of
autoantibodies produced in Goodpasture syndrome (233450) (Bernal et al.,
1993; Mariyama et al., 1994; Hamano and Kalluri, 2005).

CLONING

Butkowski et al. (1987) identified a third alpha chain of basement
membrane collagen, type IV. Studying in particular the noncollagenous
part of the alpha-3(IV) chain, Saus et al. (1988) concluded that
collagen IV is comprised of a third chain (alpha-3) together with the 2
classical ones, alpha-1 (120130) and alpha-2 (120090). They also
concluded that the epitope to which the major reactivity of
autoantibodies are targeted in the glomerular basement membrane in
patients with Goodpasture syndrome is localized to the NC1 domain of the
alpha-3(IV) chain. See also Butkowski et al. (1989). Morrison et al.
(1991) sequenced a partial cDNA encoding the COL4A3 gene.

By PCR of adult human kidney, followed by S1 nuclease mapping and primer
extension of kidney and testis total RNA, Mariyama et al. (1994)
obtained full-length COL4A3. The deduced 1,670-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 161.8 kD. It has a 28-amino acid
leucine-rich signal peptide, followed by a 1,410-amino acid collagenous
domain, and a 232-amino acid C-terminal NC1 domain. The collagenous
domain begins with a 14-amino acid noncollagenous sequence that includes
4 cysteines, and the collagenous repeat gly-X-Y is interrupted 23 times
by short noncollagenous sequences. Full-length COL4A3 has 5 arg-gly-asp
sequences that mediate binding to integrins. COL4A3 is most similar to
COL4A1 (120130) and COL4A5 (303630), indicating that it belongs to the
alpha-1-like class of type IV collagen chains. Northern blot analysis
detected strong expression of an approximately 8-kb COL4A3 transcript in
adult kidney, skeletal muscle, and lung and in fetal kidney and lung.
Expression of COL4A3 largely overlapped that of COL4A4 (120131),
suggesting that expression of the 2 transcripts may be coregulated.

The Goodpasture antigen corresponds to the C-terminal NC1 domain of
COL4A3, which is encoded by the last 5 exons of the COL4A3 gene. Using
RT-PCR, Bernal et al. (1993) identified COL4A3 splice variants lacking 1
or 2 exons in the NC1-coding region. These variants encode identical
proteins with C-terminal ends shorter than that of the full-length
protein due to the introduction of a frameshift. Since the NC1 domain of
COL4A3 is involved in alignment of individual alpha chains into a
triple-helical structure, Bernal et al. (1993) suggested that these
C-terminally truncated COL4A3 isoforms may be defective in triple-helix
formation. RT-PCR revealed significant expression of COL4A3 in kidney,
lung, suprarenal capsule, muscle, and spleen, with very low expression
in artery, fat, pericardium, and peripheral nerve. Although the COL4A3
splice variants were present in these tissues, the full-length form was
most abundant. PCR analysis of kidney cortex biopsied from a Goodpasture
patient revealed a small but reproducible decrease in the ratio of
full-length to variant transcripts compared with normal kidney.

Feng et al. (1994) also identified COL4A3 splice variants lacking
NC1-coding exons, resulting in proteins with alternative C termini.
Ribonuclease protection assays revealed changes in expression of
full-length and variant transcripts during fetal kidney development and
in adult human kidney.

By microarray analysis, Jun et al. (2001) demonstrated expression of the
COL4A3 gene in human donor corneas.

GENE STRUCTURE

Heidet et al. (2001) determined that the COL4A3 gene contains 52 exons
and spans over 88 kb.

Mariyama et al. (1994) determined that the COL4A3 gene has 2 closely
spaced major transcription start sites.

Momota et al. (1998) reported that the COL4A3 and COL4A4 genes are on
opposite strands of chromosome 2 and are transcribed in opposite
directions. The first exon of COL4A3, which contains the translation
start site, is separated from 2 alternative first exons of COL4A4 by 372
and 5 bp, respectively. The promoter region, which is shared by both
genes, is composed of dense CpG dinucleotides, GC boxes, CTC boxes, and
a CCAAT box, but not a TATA box.

MAPPING

Morrison et al. (1991) assigned a partial COL4A3 cDNA to chromosome
2q35-q37 by a combination of somatic cell hybrid studies and in situ
hybridization. Turner et al. (1992) localized the COL4A3 gene to
chromosome 2q36-q37 by analysis of somatic cell hybrids and by in situ
hybridization. Momota et al. (1998) reported that the COL4A3 and COL4A4
genes are arranged in a head-to-head fashion on chromosome 2.

GENE FUNCTION

Wieslander et al. (1984, 1985) presented immunochemical evidence that
the Goodpasture antibodies react with collagenase-resistant parts of the
type IV collagen molecule. About 5% of cases of glomerulonephritis are
mediated by autoantibodies to glomerular basement membrane (GBM). Most
of these patients present with Goodpasture syndrome (glomerulonephritis
and pulmonary hemorrhage). Butkowski et al. (1987) localized the
Goodpasture epitope to a novel chain of type IV collagen composed of 3
distinctive subunits--M1, M2*, and M3. The Goodpasture epitope was found
to be situated exclusively on M2*. Turner et al. (1992) demonstrated
that the Goodpasture antigen is the alpha-3 chain of type IV collagen
(COL4A3; 120070).

Although the primary defect in Alport syndrome (301050) involves the
COL4A5 gene (303630), the pathogenesis of the syndrome probably involves
type IV collagen molecules containing the alpha-3(IV) chain: Hudson et
al. (1992) demonstrated that the Goodpasture autoantigen is the target
alloantigen in posttransplant anti-GBM (glomerular basement membrane)
nephritis in patients with Alport syndrome. Kalluri et al. (1994)
further confirmed the unique capacity of alpha-3(IV)NC1 dimer from
bovine kidney to engage aberrantly the immune system of rabbits to
respond to self, mimicking the organ-specific form of the human disease,
whereas the other chains of type IV collagen were nonpathogenic. The
hexamer of alpha3-(IV) NC1 was nonpathogenic, suggesting the exposure of
a pathogenic epitope upon dissociation of hexamer into dimers. Exposure
of the pathogenic epitope by infection or organic solvents, events that
are thought often to precede Goodpasture syndrome, may be a principal
factor in the etiology of the disease.

Krafchak et al. (2005) detected a complex (core plus secondary) binding
site for TCF8 (189909) in the promoter of the COL4A3 gene, and presented
immunochemical evidence of ectopic expression of COL4A3 in corneal
endothelium of a proband of a family with posterior polymorphous corneal
dystrophy-3 (PPCD3; 609141). The authors suggested that the implication
of COL4A3 as a target of TCF8 regulation identifies a possible shared
molecular component of disease etiology for PPCD and Alport syndrome.

- Tumstatin

Maeshima et al. (2000) termed the noncollagenous I domain of the alpha-3
chain of type IV collagen (COL4A3) 'tumstatin.' This domain had been
discovered to possess a C-terminal peptide sequence (amino acids 185 to
203) that inhibits melanoma cell proliferation by Han et al. (1997).
Maeshima et al. (2000) identified the antiangiogenic capacity of this
domain using several in vitro and in vivo assays. Tumstatin inhibited in
vivo neovascularization in matrigel plug assays and suppressed tumor
growth of human renal cell carcinoma and prostate carcinoma in mouse
xenograft models associated with in vivo endothelial cell-specific
apoptosis. The antiangiogenic activity was localized to amino acids
54-132 using deletion mutagenesis. Shahan et al. (1999) identified amino
acids 185-203 of tumstatin as a ligand for the alpha-V-beta-3 integrin
(193210, 173470). Maeshima et al. (2000) found a distinct additional
RGD-independent alpha-V-beta-3 integrin binding site within amino acids
54 to 132 of tumstatin. Maeshima et al. (2001) demonstrated that
tumstatin peptides can inhibit proliferation of endothelial cells in the
presence of vitronectin (193190), fibronectin (135600), and collagen I
(see 120150). The antiangiogenic activity of tumstatin is localized to a
25-amino acid region (69-88) of tumstatin and is independent of
disulfide bond linkage. Maeshima et al. (2002) demonstrated that
tumstatin functions as an endothelial cell-specific inhibitor of protein
synthesis. Through a replicative interaction with alpha-V-beta-3
integrin, tumstatin inhibits activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK;
600758), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (see 171834), protein kinase-B
(164730), and mammalian target of rapamycin (601231). Maeshima et al.
(2002) further demonstrated that tumstatin prevents the dissociation of
eukaryotic initiation factor 4E protein (133440) from 4E-binding
protein-1 (602223). Maeshima et al. (2002) concluded that their results
establish a role for integrins in mediating cell-specific inhibition of
cap-dependent protein synthesis and suggest a potential mechanism for
tumstatin's selective effects on endothelial cells.

Tumstatin and endostatin, 2 inhibitors of angiogenesis, derive from the
precursor human collagen molecules COL4A3 and COL18A1 (120328),
respectively. Although both of these inhibitors are NC1 domain fragments
of collagens, they share only 14% amino acid homology. Sudhakar et al.
(2003) evaluated the functional receptors, mechanism of action, and
intracellular signaling induced by these 2 collagen-derived inhibitors.
Tumstatin prevents angiogenesis through inhibition of endothelial cell
proliferation and promotion of apoptosis with no effect on migration,
whereas endostatin prevents endothelial cell migration with no effect on
proliferation. Sudhakar et al. (2003) demonstrated that tumstatin binds
to alpha-V-beta-3 integrin in a vitronectin/fibronectin/RGD cyclic
peptide-independent manner, whereas endostatin competes with
fibronectin/RGD cyclic peptide to bind alpha-5-beta-1 integrin (135620,
135630). The activity of tumstatin is mediated by alpha-V-beta-3
integrin, whereas the activity of endostatin is mediated by
alpha-5-beta-1 integrin. Because of the distinct properties of tumstatin
and endostatin, indicating their diverse antiangiogenic actions, the
authors suggested the 2 be combined for targeting tumor angiogenesis.

Eikesdal et al. (2008) showed that leu78, val82, and asp84 of tumstatin
were essential for its antiangiogenic activity. However, mutation of all
3 of these residues had only a modest effect on binding to cell surface
alpha-V-beta-3 integrin.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Hellmark et al. (1999) provided, for the first time, the molecular
characterization of a single immunodominant conformational epitope
recognized by pathogenic autoantibodies in a human autoimmune disease.
Identified in Goodpasture disease, it represented the basis for the
development of new epitope-specific strategies in the treatment of that
disorder. Hellmark et al. (1999) identified the epitope by replacing
single residues of the COL4A3 chain with the corresponding amino acids
from the nonreactive COL4A1 gene. Replacement mutations were identified
that completely destroyed the Goodpasture epitope in the COL4A3 gene.
The substitution of 9 discontinuous positions in the COL4A1
noncollagenous domain with amino acid residues from the COL4A3 chain
resulted in the recombinant construct that was recognized by all
patients' sera but by none of the sera from healthy controls.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a patient with deletion of 2q35-q36, Pasteris et al. (1992)
demonstrated that the COL4A3 gene was deleted, as was also the PAX3
(606597) gene, which was situated proximally. The deletion was estimated
to be less than 12.5 megabases.

Lemmink et al. (1994) demonstrated mutation in the COL4A3 gene (see,
e.g., 120070.0002 and 120070.0003) as the basis of autosomal recessive
Alport syndrome (203780).

Lemmink et al. (1997) reviewed the clinical spectrum of type IV collagen
mutations associated with renal disease. They found reports of 6
mutations in the COL4A3 gene but commented that few patients and only a
small part of the gene had been studied. Patients were either
homozygotes or compound heterozygotes for the mutations, and parents
were asymptomatic carriers. All 6 COL4A3 mutations created a premature
stop codon.

In 2 unrelated families with benign familial hematuria (141200), Badenas
et al. (2002) identified 2 different heterozygous missense mutations in
the COL4A3 gene (120070.0007 and 120070.0008, respectively) affecting
the collagenous domain of the protein.

Hudson et al. (2003) reviewed the biology of type IV collagen and its
relationship to Alport syndrome and the autoimmune disorder Goodpasture
syndrome (233450). They diagrammed and reviewed the distribution and
switches of collagen IV networks in development of the renal glomerulus.

In affected members of a family with autosomal dominant Alport syndrome
(104200) reported by Jefferson et al. (1997), van der Loop et al. (2000)
identified a heterozygous mutation in the COL4A3 gene (120070.0009). The
mutation resulted in a splice site mutation and a mutant protein with a
deletion in the collagenous domain. The mutation was found in all 6
affected individuals and in none of 8 unaffected individuals. Since the
noncollagenous domain remained intact, this mutant chain may be
incorporated and distort the collagen triple helix, causing a dominant
effect. The finding of a COL4A3 mutation in autosomal dominant Alport
syndrome completed the broad spectrum of type IV collagen mutations,
ranging from no effect at all and familial benign hematuria to mild
autosomal dominant and severe autosomal recessive Alport syndrome.

- Associations Pending Confirmation

For discussion of a possible association between variation in the COL4A3
gene and keratoconus, see KTCN1 (148300).

EVOLUTION

MacDonald et al. (2006) showed that the alpha-3(IV) chain is not present
in C. elegans or Drosophila melanogaster, but is present in Danio rerio
(zebrafish). However, zebrafish alpha-3(IV)NC1 does not bind Goodpasture
autoantibodies. There also was complete absence of autoantibody binding
to recombinant zebrafish alpha-3(VI)NC1. It appeared that evolutionary
alteration of electrostatic charge and polarity due to the emergence of
critical serine, aspartic acid, and lysine residues, accompanied by the
loss of asparagine and glutamine, contributed to the emergence of the 2
major Goodpasture epitopes on the human alpha-3(IV)NC1 domain, as it
evolved from Danio rerio over 450 million years.

ANIMAL MODEL

Canine X-linked hereditary nephritis is an animal model for human
X-linked hereditary nephritis (Alport syndrome) (301050) characterized
by the presence of a premature stop codon in the alpha-5 chain of
collagen type IV. Thorner et al. (1996) examined expression of the
canine collagen type IV genes in the kidney. They detected alpha-3,
alpha-4 (120131), and alpha-5 chains in the noncollagenous domain of
type IV collagen isolated from normal dog glomeruli but not in affected
dog glomeruli. In addition to a significantly reduced level of COL4A5
gene expression (approximately 10% of normal), expression of the COL4A3
and COL4A4 genes was also decreased to 14-23% and 11-17%, respectively.
These findings suggested to Thorner et al. (1996) a mechanism which
coordinates the expression of these 3 basement membrane proteins.

Cosgrove et al. (1996) produced a mouse model for the autosomal form of
Alport syndrome by a COL4A3 knockout. The mice developed progressive
glomerulonephritis with microhematuria and proteinuria. End-stage renal
disease developed at about 14 weeks of age. Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) of glomerular basement membranes (GBM) during
development of renal pathology revealed focal multilaminated thickening
and thinning beginning in the external capillary loops at 4 weeks and
spreading throughout the GBM by 8 weeks. By 14 weeks, half of the
glomeruli were fibrotic with collapsed capillaries. Immunofluorescence
analysis of the GBM showed the absence of type IV collagen alpha-3,
alpha-4, and alpha-5 chains and a persistence of alpha-1 and alpha-2
chains, which are normally localized to the mesangial matrix. Northern
blot analysis using probes specific for the collagen chains demonstrated
the absence of COL4A3 in the knockout, whereas mRNAs for the remaining
chains were unchanged. The progression of Alport renal disease was
correlated in time and space with the accumulation of fibronectin,
heparan sulfate proteoglycan, laminin-1 (see 150320), and entactin
(131390) in the GBM of the affected animals.

Hamano et al. (2002) showed that Col4a3-deficient mice had normal
expression of podocyte- and slit diaphragm-associated proteins until 4
weeks after birth, despite significant structural defects in the
glomerular basement membrane. At week 5, there were alterations within
the slit diaphragm, podocyte effacement, and altered expression of
nephrin (602716), a slit diaphragm-associated protein. Hamano et al.
(2002) concluded that defects in glomerular basement membrane proteins
lead to an insidious plasma protein leak, while breakdown of the slit
diaphragms leads to precipitous plasma protein leak.

Lu et al. (1999) generated the transgenic mouse line OVE250 by
microinjection of the 4.1-kb tyrosinase minigene construct TyBS into
1-cell embryos of the inbred albino strain FVB/N. Mice homozygous for
the transgenic insertion exhibited severe progressive
glomerulonephritis, resembling the Alport syndrome in man. The injected
minigene construct created a mutation at the site of insertion on mouse
chromosome 1, leading to a deletion in the Col4a3 and Col4a4
head-to-head pair region, including exons 1 through 12 of the Col4a4
gene, exons 1 and 2 of the adjacent Col4a3 gene, and the intergenic
promoter region. Transcripts of Col4a3 and Col4a4 were undetectable in
the mutant kidney, and both proteins were missing from the glomerular
basement membrane. This animal model of human Alport syndrome,
designated Col4del3-4, lacks both alpha-3 and alpha-4 chains of collagen
IV.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ALPORT SYNDROME, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
COL4A3, 5-BP DEL, NT4414

Mochizuki et al. (1994) demonstrated that 1 patient with autosomal
recessive Alport syndrome (203780) was heterozygous and another
homozygous for a deletion of 5 nucleotides in exon 5 of the COL4A3 gene,
resulting in a markedly truncated protein. In a review of type IV
collagen mutations, Lemmink et al. (1997) stated that this mutation was
deletion of 5 bp after nucleotide 4414. The deletion caused a frameshift
after leu1474 with a stop 33 codons downstream. Renal failure developed
at age 9 years.

analysis followed by sequencing, Lemmink et al. (1994) demonstrated that
a patient with autosomal recessive Alport syndrome (203780) was a
compound heterozygote for an arg43-to-ter mutation in exon 5 and a
ser86-to-ter (120070.0003) mutation in exon 4 of the COL4A3 gene.
Lemmink et al. (1997) provided a catalog of COL4A3 mutations. Six had
been described to that date. The authors indicated that the mutation
previously designated arg43-to-ter was in fact arg1481-to-ter, due to a
C-to-T transition of nucleotide 4441. Mochizuki et al. (1994) described
a homozygote for the arg1481-to-ter mutation. Renal failure in this case
occurred at the age of 11 years.

ALPORT SYNDROME, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
COL4A3, SER1524TER

Lemmink et al. (1994) demonstrated that a patient with autosomal
recessive Alport syndrome (203780) was a compound heterozygote for
mutations which were initially defined as arg43-to-ter in exon 5 and
ser86-to-ter in exon 4 of the COL4A3 gene; with further information
concerning the COL4A3 gene, the mutations were defined as
arg1481-to-ter, due to a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 4441
(120070.0002), and ser1524-to-ter, due to a C-to-G transversion at
nucleotide 4559.

ALPORT SYNDROME, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
COL4A3, 5-BP DEL

In family VB with autosomal recessive Alport syndrome (203780),
Mochizuki et al. (1994) demonstrated homozygosity for a 5-bp CTTTT
deletion in the NC1 domain of the COL4A3 gene. There are 10 5-bp
deletions that would result in the observed sequence difference. All of
them produce a frameshift and have precisely the same effect on the
amino acid sequence: a missense sequence of 33 amino acids and premature
chain termination. The change occurred in exon 5. There are also 5
possible 5-prime bp tandem repeats. A 'replication slippage' at any of
the 10 points could cause the observed change. The female proband in
this family had sensorineural deafness, hematuria from 4 years of age,
and typical ultrastructural lesions of Alport syndrome on electron
microscopy of renal biopsy. Hemodialysis was started at age 9. Renal
allograft was received at age 10, following which she developed anti-GBM
nephritis. In a competitive ELISA, binding of the patient's serum was
inhibited by increasing concentrations of Goodpasture sera which
contains autoantibodies directed toward the NC1 domain of COL4A3. The
patient's brother had hematuria, deafness, and deteriorating renal
function. The parents were asymptomatic. They were not known to be
related, but their ancestors originated from the same small village in
the Netherlands.

.0005
ALPORT SYNDROME, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
COL4A3, EX5, C-T, ARG-TER

In a Belgian girl, born of consanguineous parents, with autosomal
recessive Alport syndrome (203780), Mochizuki et al. (1994) identified a
homozygous C-to-T transition in exon 5 of the COL4A3 gene, counting from
the 3-prime end (Quinones et al., 1992). This mutation replaced an
arginine codon with a stop codon in the NC1 domain, shortening the
alpha-3(IV) chain by 190 amino acids; it was expected to disrupt 11 of
the intermolecular disulfide bonds that stabilize the homodimerization
of NC1 domains. The patient was found to have proteinuria and
microhematuria at age 7, resulting in end-stage renal disease by age 11.
At age 11, the patient had renal transplant from her mother, and had not
developed rejection or anti-GMB nephritis by age 16. At age 13, an
audiogram showed bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Both unaffected
parents had normal renal function and urinalysis.

.0006
ALPORT SYNDROME, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
COL4A3, ALU INS, EX6

In the process of screening the illegitimate transcripts of COL4A3 in
lymphocytes from a patient with autosomal recessive Alport syndrome
(203780), Knebelmann et al. (1995) discovered an antisense Alu sequence
that had been spliced into the mature transcript after a G-to-T
transversion activated a cryptic splice site located in the Alu element
within intron V. The resultant 74-bp insertion was at the junction of
exons IV or V and VI in the final transcript. This was the first
observation of a splicing abnormality in the COL4A3 gene in autosomal
recessive Alport syndrome. The precise mutation involved the insertion
of an abnormally spliced intron 5 fragment (Finielz et al., 1998). This
intron 5 mutation was found in 4 families in Reunion Island. In 1
family, 3 patients, all male, were involved. Two were placed on
hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease at ages 28 and 26; the third,
aged 13, had normal serum creatinine concentration values. All 3
patients had hearing impairment but no ocular lesions. The 3 other
families from a different town had discovery of Alport syndrome at
earlier ages ranging from 3 to 13 years on the basis of macroscopic
hematuria and/or proteinuria, and in only 1 case was deafness evident.
Males and females seemed to be equally involved (3 boys, 3 girls).
End-stage renal failure occurred earlier (ages 14, 14, 18, and 15),
unrelated to sex. Auditory impairment was a constant feature; ocular
impairment involved 1 patient only. Undefined environmental factors or
phenotype-modulating genes (around the assay genes) were hypothesized.

.0007
HEMATURIA, BENIGN FAMILIAL
COL4A3, GLY1015GLU

In a family with benign familial hematuria (141200), Badenas et al.
(2002) identified a mutation in exon 36 of the COL4A3 gene that resulted
in a gly1015-to-glu (G1015E) amino acid substitution in the collagenous
domain of the protein.

.0008
HEMATURIA, BENIGN FAMILIAL
COL4A3, GLY985VAL

In a family with benign familial hematuria (141200), Badenas et al.
(2002) identified a mutation in exon 35 of the COL4A3 gene that resulted
in a gly985-to-val (G985V) amino acid substitution in the collagenous
domain of the protein.

.0009
ALPORT SYNDROME, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
COL4A3, IVS21DS, G-A, -1

In affected members of a family with autosomal dominant Alport syndrome
(104200) reported by Jefferson et al. (1997), van der Loop et al. (2000)
identified a heterozygous G-to-A transition in the last nucleotide of
exon 21 of the COL4A3 gene. Although the change would predict a
gly493-to-ser (G493S) substitution, mRNA analysis indicated that the
mutation causes a splice site mutation, resulting in the skipping of
exon 21 and a mutated chain that lacks 55 amino acids in the collagenous
domain. The mutation was found in all 6 affected individuals and in none
of 8 unaffected individuals. Since the noncollagenous domain is intact,
this mutant chain may be incorporated and distort the collagen triple
helix, causing a dominant effect. The finding of a COL4A3 mutation in
autosomal dominant Alport syndrome completed the broad spectrum of type
IV collagen mutations.

.0010
ALPORT SYNDROME, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
COL4A3, GLY1167ARG

In a mother and daughter with autosomal dominant Alport syndrome
(104200), Heidet et al. (2001) identified a heterozygous 3499G-A
transition in exon 40 of the COL4A3 gene, resulting in a gly1167-to-arg
(G1167R) substitution. The daughter developed end-stage renal failure at
age 23 years. Her mother had microscopic hematuria and proteinuria, but
still had normal renal function at age 52 years, although renal biopsy
showed thinning of and splitting of the glomerular basement membrane.

613360	TITLE *613360 DAMAGE-REGULATED AUTOPHAGY MODULATOR 2; DRAM2
;;TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN 77; TMEM77
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases for DRAM1 (610776)-related sequences, O'Prey et
al. (2009) identified DRAM2. The deduced 266-amino acid DRAM2 protein
shares 45% identity with DRAM1. Northern blot analysis detected variable
expression of DRAM2 in most tissues examined, with highest expression in
placenta and heart and little to no expression in brain and thymus.
Immunohistochemical analysis showed that DRAM2 colocalized with a
lysosomal marker.

Independently, Park et al. (2009) identified DRAM2 by database analysis.
The deduced 266-amino acid protein has 6 putative transmembrane domains
and a unique 21-amino acid C-terminal region not found in DRAM1. Western
blot analysis detected endogenous DRAM2 at an apparent molecular mass of
35 kD in HEK293 cells. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that DRAM1
and DRAM2 colocalized in lysosomes.

GENE FUNCTION

Using semiquantitative PCR and Western blot analysis, Park et al. (2009)
showed that expression of DRAM2 mRNA and protein was downregulated in a
majority of ovarian cancers compared with matched normal tissue.
Overexpression of either DRAM1 or DRAM2 in HEK293 cells did not alter
cell viability, but coexpression of both proteins increased apoptotic
cell death. Silencing of DRAM2 in a human colon carcinoma cell line
provided protection against p53 (TP53; 191170)-induced cell death,
suggesting that DRAM2 has a role in p53-mediated apoptosis.

MAPPING

Hartz (2010) mapped the DRAM2 gene to chromosome 1p13.3 based on an
alignment of the DRAM2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK075350) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

E1B55-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 5; E1BAP5
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Adenoviral DNA replication and nucleocytoplasmic RNA transport are
regulated by the early-1B 55-kD protein (E1B55). During late viral
infection, most cellular mRNAs fail to accumulate in the cytoplasm and
protein synthesis is shut off. In contrast, late viral mRNAs are
exported to the cytoplasm for efficient translation to protein. Using
radioactive E1B55 to screen a HeLa cell expression library, Gabler et
al. (1998) isolated cDNAs encoding E1B-associated proteins, including
E1BAP5. The predicted 856-amino acid protein, which is similar in part
to heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U (HNRPU; 602869), contains
centrally located phosphate- and magnesium-binding motifs required for
guanine nucleotide binding. The C terminus of E1BAP5 contains RGG
repeats and a region similar to the N terminus of HNRPG (see 300199),
and is rich in proline, glutamine, and tyrosine. On the basis of
sequence similarity, Gabler et al. (1998) proposed that E1BAP5 is a
member of the HNRP family. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of
3.2- and 3.8-kb E1BAP5 transcripts in all tissues tested. Immunoblot
analysis showed expression of a 120-kD protein, greater than the
predicted 96 kD, that associated with E1B55. Immunofluorescence
microscopy demonstrated expression in the nucleus, with exclusion from
the nucleolus, and weak cytosolic expression.

GENE FUNCTION

Binding analysis by Gabler et al. (1998) showed that E1B55 associated
with E1BAP5, but not with HNRPU. Like HNRPU, E1BAP5 bound poly(G) RNA
and single-stranded DNA. Stable expression of E1BAP5 stimulated late
viral transcript export and prevented shutdown of cellular mRNA
transport.

Barral et al. (2005) showed that E1BAP5 interacted directly with p53
(TP53; 191170) and inhibited induction of p53-regulated genes following
ultraviolet irradiation.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the
HNRNPUL1 gene to chromosome 19 (TMAP stSG9088).

602270	TITLE *602270 ANTIOXIDANT PROTEIN 1; ATOX1
;;ATX, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF, 1; HAH1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Copper is one of the most prevalent transition metals in living
organisms. Because free copper is toxic, copper homeostasis is tightly
controlled by molecular mechanisms in which the metal is sequestered by
protein carriers. ATOX1 is a copper chaperone that delivers copper to
the metal-binding domains of the ATPase proteins ATP7A (300011) and
ATP7B (606882). In an ATP-dependent process, ATP7A or ATP7B (depending
on the cell type) translocates copper from the cytoplasm into the Golgi
lumen for insertion into enzymes in the secretory pathway (summary by
Hussain et al. (2008)).

CLONING

Cells have highly specialized and complex systems for maintaining copper
homeostasis which have been conserved through evolution. Yeast Atx1
encodes a cytosolic copper-binding protein that is essential for
efficient high-affinity iron uptake and antioxidant defense. By
screening a liver cDNA library, Klomp et al. (1997) isolated a
full-length cDNA encoding ATOX1, the human homolog of Atx1, which they
called HAH1 for 'human atx homolog-1.' The deduced 68-amino acid ATOX1
protein shares 47% identity with yeast Atx1, including conservation of
the copper-binding domain and the lysine-rich C terminus. Northern blot
analysis showed that ATOX1 was abundantly and ubiquitously expressed as
a 0.5-kb transcript. Southern blot analysis showed that the ATOX1 gene
exists as a single copy in the haploid genome.

Moore et al. (2002) investigated the tissue-specific localization of
mouse Atox1. Immunohistochemical studies in liver localized the copper
chaperone to hepatocytes surrounding both hepatic and central veins. In
kidney, Atox1 localized to the cortex and the medulla. Cortex
immunostaining was specific to glomeruli in both the juxtamedullary and
cortical nephrons. Expression in the medulla appeared to be associated
with the loops of Henle. These data suggested that localized regions in
the liver and kidney express ATOX1 and have a role in copper homeostasis
and/or antioxidant protection.

GENE FUNCTION

Klomp et al. (1997) showed that human ATOX1 complemented Atx1-null yeast
strains. By analogy to yeast, they suggested that ATOX1 binds and
delivers cytosolic copper to ATP7A and ATP7B in the trans-Golgi network.
In addition to a role for ATOX1 in copper homeostasis, Klomp et al.
(1997) proposed that, analogous to yeast, copper proteins dependent upon
ATOX1 are important in cellular antioxidant defense.

By mutation analysis, Hussain et al. (2008) found that the highly
conserved residues met10 and lys60 in human ATOX1 were critical for
copper retention. Mutation of either of these residues to alanine
increased the rate and extent of copper transfer from ATOX1 to a copper
chelator.

MAPPING

Klomp et al. (1997) mapped the ATOX1 gene to chromosome 5q32-q33 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

Boultwood et al. (2000) mapped the ATOX1 gene to the 3-Mb critical
region of gene loss of the 5q- syndrome (153550) within 5q32, flanked by
the genes for ADRB2 (109690) and IL12B (161561), using gene dosage
analysis. Fine physical mapping studies by screening YAC and BAC contigs
spanning the critical region of the 5q- syndrome showed that ATOX1 maps
immediately adjacent to the SPARC gene (182120). Boultwood et al. (2000)
suggested that ATOX1 represents a candidate gene for the 5q- syndrome.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Alvarez et al. (2010) described how tetrathiomolybdate (TM) inhibits
proteins that regulate copper physiology. Crystallographic results
revealed that the surprising stability of the drug complex with the
metallochaperone Atx1 arises from formation of a sulfur-bridged
copper-molybdenum cluster reminiscent of those found in molybdenum and
iron sulfur proteins. Spectroscopic studies indicated that this cluster
is stable in solution and corresponds to physiologic clusters isolated
from TM-treated Wilson disease (277900) animal models. Finally,
mechanistic studies showed that the drug-metallochaperone inhibits metal
transfer functions between copper-trafficking proteins. Alvarez et al.
(2010) concluded that their results are consistent with a model wherein
TM can directly and reversibly downregulate copper delivery to secreted
metalloenzymes.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hamza et al. (2001) found that Atox1-null mice failed to thrive
immediately after birth, with 45% of pups dying before weaning.
Surviving animals exhibited growth failure, skin laxity,
hypopigmentation, and seizures because of perinatal copper deficiency.
Maternal Atox1 deficiency markedly increased the severity of the
phenotype in the null progeny, resulting in increased perinatal
mortality as well as severe growth retardation and congenital
malformations among surviving Atox1 -/- progeny. Furthermore,
Atox1-deficient cells accumulated high levels of intracellular copper,
and metabolic studies indicated that this defect was caused by impaired
cellular copper efflux. Taken together, these data revealed a direct
role for Atox1 in trafficking of intracellular copper to the secretory
pathway of mammalian cells and demonstrated that this metallochaperone
plays a critical role in perinatal copper homeostasis.

606609	TITLE *606609 3-PRIME @REPAIR EXONUCLEASE 1; TREX1
;;DNase III
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The multistep processes of DNA replication, repair, and recombination
require the excision of nucleotides from DNA 3-prime termini. Enzymes
containing 3-prime-to-5-prime exonuclease activity remove mismatched,
modified, fragmented, and normal nucleotides to generate the appropriate
3-prime termini for subsequent steps in the DNA metabolic pathways
(Mazur and Perrino, 1999).

CLONING

By micropeptide sequence analysis of the 30-kD bovine Trex1 protein, PCR
with degenerate primers, and EST database searching, Mazur and Perrino
(1999) obtained cDNAs encoding mouse and human TREX1 and TREX2 (300370).
Sequence analysis predicted that the 304-amino acid TREX1 protein is 44%
identical to TREX2 (Mazur and Perrino (2001) corrected the TREX1
sequence to 314 amino acids). TREX1 contains 3 conserved exonuclease
motifs, with an HxAxxD sequence in the third motif. Functional analysis
confirmed that the 3-prime-to-5-prime exonuclease activity of the
recombinant protein is comparable to that of the native protein and
prefers mismatched 3-prime termini. Mazur and Perrino (1999) concluded
that the TREX proteins are small, independent 3-prime excision enzymes,
whereas the multifunctional p53 (191170) and WRN (RECQL2; 604611)
proteins, which also have 3-prime-to-5-prime exonuclease activity, are
much larger.

Using rabbit Trex1 to search an EST database, Hoss et al. (1999) also
isolated human TREX1, which they termed DNase III. Northern blot
analysis revealed expression of a 1.15-kb TREX1 transcript in all
tissues tested.

Mazur and Perrino (2001) used 5-prime RACE to identify the flanking
region of TREX1. Genomic sequence analysis suggested that TREX1 open
reading frames are produced by a variety of mechanisms, including
alternate promoter usage, alternative splicing, and varied sites for
3-prime cleavage. RT-PCR analysis detected ubiquitous expression of
TREX1.

GENE STRUCTURE

The TREX1 gene contains a single exon (Hoss et al., 1999; Mazur and
Perrino, 2001).

MAPPING

Hoss et al. (1999) and Mazur and Perrino (2001) identified clones
containing the TREX1 gene that map to chromosome 3p21.3-p21.2.

GENE FUNCTION

SET (600960) and NM23H1 (NME1; 156490) reside in an endoplasmic
reticulum-associated complex, the SET complex, that translocates to the
nucleus in response to superoxide generation by granzyme A (GZMA;
140050). Chowdhury et al. (2006) identified TREX1 as a component of the
SET complex. TREX1 bound SET and colocalized and translocated with the
SET complex. On its own, TREX1 did not damage intact DNA, but it acted
in concert with NM23H1 to destroy DNA during granzyme A-mediated cell
death. After NM23H1 nicked 1 strand, TREX1 removed bases from the free
3-prime end to enhance the damage and prevent DNA end reannealing and
repair.

Using mass spectrometry and Western blot analysis, Stetson et al. (2008)
identified mouse Trex1 as a protein involved in recognition of
interferon stimulatory DNA (ISD) BrdU-labeled intracellular
oligonucleotides. Microarray analysis showed that Trex1 was upregulated
in response to ISD stimulation. However, Trex1 -/- cells retained an
intact ISD response, ruling out Trex1 as the ISD sensor. In contrast
with Trex1 -/- mice, which succumb to lethal autoimmunity (see ANIMAL
MODEL), Trex1 -/- mice lacking Irf3 (603734), Ifnar1 (107450), or Rag2
(179616) survived and regained normal body weight through amelioration
of disease at discrete phases, indicating that TREX1 substrates are
ligands of the ISD pathway. Single-stranded DNA derived from endogenous
retroelements accumulated in Trex1 -/- cells, and Trex1 metabolized
reverse-transcribed DNA. Stetson et al. (2008) concluded that TREX1 is
an essential negative regulator of the ISD response and represents a
mechanism to prevent autoimmunity caused by endogenous retroelements.

Using mutation analysis with recombinant human TREX1, Fye et al. (2011)
found that arg174 and lys175 within the flexible loop and arg128 in the
catalytic core contributed to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and
double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) degradation. TREX1 degraded
endonuclease-treated hamster liver nuclei, suggesting that TREX1
contributes to apoptosis-associated DNA degradation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Aicardi-Goutieres Syndrome 1

In affected members of 10 families with Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome
(AGS1; 225750), Crow et al. (2006) identified 5 different mutations in
the TREX1 gene in homozygous or compound heterozygous state (see, e.g.,
606609.0001-606609.0004). One of the mutations, R114H (606609.0001), was
identified in 7 European pedigrees. Crow et al. (2006) identified a
homozygous mutation in the TREX1 gene (606609.0002) in a patient
originally diagnosed with Cree encephalitis, indicating that Cree
encephalitis is essentially the same disorder as AGS1.

Rice et al. (2007) described a de novo heterozygous TREX1 mutation,
affecting a critical catalytic residue in TREX1 (D200N; 606609.0006),
that resulted in typical Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome, thus defining a
dominant form of the disorder.

Haaxma et al. (2010) reported a second patient with Aicardi-Goutieres
syndrome and a de novo heterozygous TREX1 mutation (D18N; 606609.0007).
The D18N mutation had previously been identified in heterozygosity by
Lee-Kirsch et al. (2007) in a family with chilblain lupus.

- Susceptibility to Systemic Lupus Erythematosus

Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome shows overlap with systemic erythematosus
(SLE; 152700) at both clinical and pathologic levels. Lee-Kirsch et al.
(2007) analyzed the TREX1 gene in 417 patients with SLE and 1,712
controls and identified heterozygosity for a 3-prime UTR variant and 11
nonsynonymous changes in 12 patients (see, e.g., 606609.0001). They
found only 2 nonsynonymous changes in 2 controls (p = 1.7 X 10(-7),
relative risk = 25.3). In vitro studies of 2 frameshift mutations
revealed that both caused altered subcellular distribution.

- Chilblain Lupus

Rice et al. (2007) reported a heterozygous TREX1 mutation (606609.0005)
causing familial chilblain lupus (CHBL; 610448), a rare cutaneous form
of SLE.

In affected members of the large 5-generation German family with
chilblain lupus in which the disease was mapped to chromosome 3p21-p14
by Lee-Kirsch et al. (2006), Lee-Kirsch et al. (2007) identified
heterozygosity for a missense mutation (D18N; 606609.0007) in the TREX1
gene.

- Retinal Vasculopathy with Cerebral Leukodystrophy

In 9 families with autosomal dominant retinal vasculopathy with cerebral
leukodystrophy (192315), Richards et al. (2007) identified 5 different
heterozygous frameshift mutations at the C terminus of the TREX1 gene
(see, e.g., 606609.0008 and 606609.0009). In expression studies, the
truncated proteins retained exonuclease activity but lost normal
perinuclear localization.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

The TREX1 D200N and D18N dominant heterozygous mutations are associated
with AGS1 and CHBL, respectively. Using exonuclease enzyme analysis,
Lehtinen et al. (2008) showed that TREX1 heterodimers containing
wildtype TREX1 and either D200N or D18N mutant proteins were completely
deficient in degrading dsDNA and degraded ssDNA at an approximately
2-fold lower rate than wildtype TREX1. In addition, D200N- and
D18N-containing homo- and heterodimers inhibited the dsDNA degradation
activity of wildtype TREX1, providing an explanation for the dominant
phenotype of the mutant alleles. In contrast, the R114H mutation, which
causes AGS1 when present as a homozygous mutation and SLE when present
as a heterozygous mutation, had dysfunctional dsDNA and ssDNA
degradation activities as a homodimer, but it was functional as a
heterodimer. The R114H homodimer lacked inhibitory activity against
wildtype TREX1, supporting the recessive genetics of the R114H mutation
in AGS1. Lehtinen et al. (2008) concluded that the dysfunctional dsDNA
activities of the disease-related TREX1 mutants could account for
persistent dsDNA from dying cells leading to an aberrant autoimmune
response in these disorders.

ANIMAL MODEL

Morita et al. (2004) found that Trex1 -/- mice developed inflammatory
myocarditis, suggesting a role for this enzyme in immune regulation.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
AICARDI-GOUTIERES SYNDROME 1
SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, INCLUDED
TREX1, ARG114HIS

In affected members of 7 families of European origin with
Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome-1 (225750), Crow et al. (2006) identified a
341G-A transition in the TREX1 gene, resulting in an arg114-to-his
(R114H) substitution at a residue predicted to be involved in protein
dimerization. Five of the families were homozygous for the mutation and
2 were compound heterozygous with another TREX1 mutation (606609.0003).
Patient-derived fibroblasts showed no detectable TREX1 3-prime
exonuclease activity.

Lee Kirsch et al. (2007) analyzed the TREX1 gene in 417 patients with
systemic lupus erythematosus (152700) and identified heterozygosity for
the R114H mutation in a European female patient who had nephritis,
arthritis, and antinuclear and anti-dsDNA antibodies.

In an extensive study of the clinical and molecular phenotypes of
Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome, Rice et al. (2007) found biallelic mutations
in TREX1 in 31 of 127 families with the clinical diagnosis of the
disorder. Eighteen families, 14 of which were of northern European
origin, were homozygous (15) or compound heterozygous (3) for the 341G-A
transition (R114H). Notably, all R114H homozygotes were also homozygous
for the T allele of a SNP at position 531. This allele exhibited highly
significant (P less than 0.001) overrepresentation in patients compared
with controls (with a T allele population frequency of 0.4), suggesting
that R114H might be an ancient founder mutation.

.0002
AICARDI-GOUTIERES SYNDROME 1
TREX1, ARG164TER

In a patient with Cree encephalitis, also known as AGS1 (225750), born
of consanguineous parents, Crow et al. (2006) identified a homozygous
490C-T transition in the TREX1 gene, resulting in an arg164-to-ter
(R164X) substitution. A lymphoblastoid cell line derived from the
patient showed no detectable 3-prime exonuclease activity. The findings
confirmed that Cree encephalitis and AGS1 are essentially the same
disorder.

.0003
AICARDI-GOUTIERES SYNDROME 1
TREX1, 3-BP INS, 600GAT

In affected members of 2 unrelated families with AGS1 (225750), Crow et
al. (2006) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
TREX1 gene: a 3-bp insertion (600insGAT), resulting in duplication of an
aspartate residue involved in divalent cation binding within the
catalytic site, and R114H (606609.0001).

.0004
AICARDI-GOUTIERES SYNDROME 1
TREX1, VAL201ASP

In a patient with AGS1 (225750), born of consanguineous Turkish parents,
Crow et al. (2006) identified a homozygous 602T-A transversion in the
TREX1 gene, resulting in a val201-to-asp (V201D) substitution in the
catalytic site of the protein. Patient-derived fibroblasts showed no
detectable TREX1 3-prime exonuclease activity.

.0005
CHILBLAIN LUPUS
TREX1, 1-BP DUP, 375T

In a nonconsanguineous Bangladeshi family, Rice et al. (2007) found
association between chilblain lupus (610448) and a heterozygous mutation
in the TREX1 gene, the duplication of a single base (375dupT) that
resulted in a truncated protein missing the last 188 amino acids. The
mutation was present in 3 affected sibs; it was found also in a fourth
sib with a subclinical phenotype.

.0006
AICARDI-GOUTIERES SYNDROME 1, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
TREX1, ASP200ASN

In a child with a classic history of Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome
(225750), born to nonconsanguineous Scottish parents, Rice et al. (2007)
found heterozygosity for a missense mutation in the TREX1 gene: a 598G-A
transition that resulted in a substitution of asparagine for aspartic
acid at codon 200 (D200N). Both parents had a homozygous wildtype
genotype at this position, suggesting a de novo occurrence.
Differentiation of the maternal and paternal alleles was possible
because of a frequently observed C-to-T SNP at position 531, which
allowed the authors to demonstrate that the mutation has arisen on the
maternal allele. A standard exonuclease assay indicated close-to-normal
TREX1 enzymatic activity. Rice et al. (2007) hypothesized that the
aspartic acid at position 200 of TREX1 represents one of 4 residues
essential for coordinating 2 magnesium ions involved in DNA binding and
catalysis, and that the D200N mutation represents a gain-of-function
mutation conferring altered substrate specificity, DNA binding, or
protein-protein interaction which would not be detected in a standard
TREX1 exonuclease assay.

Fye et al. (2011) stated that asp18 and asp200 are the 2 aspartates that
coordinate the divalent metal ion Mg(2+) at the TREX1 active site and
contribute to DNA binding and catalysis. They found that homodimers of
recombinant human TREX1 containing D200N or D18N (606609.0007) mutations
had negligible nuclease activity against ssDNA and dsDNA compared with
wildtype. Heterodimers of wildtype TREX1 with D18N or D200N TREX1
mutants had more modestly reduced ssDNA nuclease activity, but
profoundly reduced dsDNA nuclease activity, compared with wildtype
homodimers. Fye et al. (2011) concluded that the dominant phenotypes of
asp18 and asp200 mutations relate predominantly to impaired dsDNA
degradation and indicate that TREX1 dsDNA degradation activity is
fundamental to the prevention of autoimmunity.

.0007
CHILBLAIN LUPUS
AICARDI-GOUTIERES SYNDROME 1, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT, INCLUDED
TREX1, ASP18ASN

In affected members of the large 5-generation German family with
chilblain lupus (610448) previously described by Lee-Kirsch et al.
(2006), Lee-Kirsch et al. (2007) identified heterozygosity for a 52G-A
transversion in exon 1 of the TREX1 gene, resulting in an asp18-to-asn
(D18N) substitution at a highly conserved residue critical for catalytic
activity. The mutation was not found in unaffected family members or in
400 control chromosomes. Recombinant mutant TREX1 homodimers were
enzymatically inactive, whereas mutant/wildtype heterodimers had
approximately 40% of the activity of wildtype dimers, indicating that
D18N is a loss-of-function allele that does not exhibit a
dominant-negative effect. Compared to control cells, patient-derived
lymphoblastoid cells were substantially less sensitive to cell death
after treatment with granzyme A (GZMA; 140050) but not granzyme B (GZMB;
123910), indicating that D18N specifically interferes with GZMA-mediated
cell death in the caspase-independent form of apoptosis.

In a 16-year-old girl with relatively mild Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome
(AGS1; 225750), who was negative for mutation in other known AGS genes,
Haaxma et al. (2010) identified a de novo heterozygous D18N missense
mutation in the TREX1 gene. The mutation was not found in either parent
or in 200 control chromosomes. The patient also displayed features of
mitochondrial disease, with cytochrome oxidase-negative and ragged-red
fibers seen on histologic examination of the quadriceps muscle;
biochemical measurements showed decreased overall energy production (ATP
and CrP) in the presence of normal activities of individual respiratory
chain complexes, again compatible with mitochondrial dysfunction.
However, heteroduplex analysis of the entire mitochondrial DNA did not
show any mutations. This patient also had peripheral neuropathy with
prominent axonal loss and disturbances of myelination without strict
demyelination.

Fye et al. (2011) stated that asp18 and asp200 are the 2 aspartates that
coordinate the divalent metal ion Mg(2+) at the TREX1 active site and
contribute to DNA binding and catalysis. They found that homodimers of
recombinant human TREX1 containing D200N (60609.0006) or D18N mutations
had negligible nuclease activity against ssDNA and dsDNA compared with
wildtype. Heterodimers of wildtype TREX1 with D18N or D200N TREX1
mutants had more modestly reduced ssDNA nuclease activity, but
profoundly reduced dsDNA nuclease activity, compared with wildtype
homodimers. Fye et al. (2011) concluded that the dominant phenotypes of
asp18 and asp200 mutations relates predominantly to impaired dsDNA
degradation and indicates that TREX1 dsDNA degradation activity is
fundamental to the prevention of autoimmunity.

VASCULOPATHY, RETINAL, WITH CEREBRAL LEUKODYSTROPHY
TREX1, 1-BP INS, 3688G

In 5 families with autosomal dominant retinal vasculopathy with cerebral
leukodystrophy (192315), including 2 North American families previously
reported by Grand et al. (1988) and 1 Dutch pedigree originally
described by Storimans et al. (1991), Richards et al. (2007) identified
heterozygosity for a 1-bp insertion (3688G) at the C terminus of the
TREX1 gene, resulting in a frameshift at val235 (V235fs). Haplotype
analysis suggested that these families were not related. The mutation
was not found in 192 Caucasian, 192 Chinese, or 300 Dutch control
alleles. In expression studies, the truncated protein retained
exonuclease activity but lost normal perinuclear localization.

In a North American family of Chinese ancestry with autosomal dominant
retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukodystrophy (192315), previously
reported by Jen et al. (1997), Richards et al. (2007) identified
heterozygosity for a 4-bp duplication (3727dupGTCA) at the C terminus of
the TREX1 gene, resulting in a frameshift at thr249 (T249fs). The
mutation was not found in 192 Caucasian, 192 Chinese, or 300 Dutch
control alleles. In expression studies, the truncated protein retained
exonuclease activity but lost normal perinuclear localization.

601497	TITLE *601497 BCL2-ASSOCIATED ATHANOGENE 1; BAG1
;;RECEPTOR-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN, 46-KD; RAP46
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The oncogene BCL2 (151430) is a membrane protein that blocks a step in a
pathway leading to apoptosis. Takayama et al. (1995) used interaction
cloning to identify Bag1, a mouse protein that binds to Bcl2. The Bag1
protein is rich in glutamic acid residues.

By screening a human liver expression library with activated
glucocorticoid receptor (GCCR; 138040), Zeiner and Gehring (1995) cloned
BAG1, which they called RAP46. The deduced 274-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 31 kD. It had an apparent molecular mass of
46 kD by SDS-PAGE. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.4-kb Rap46
transcript in all mouse tissues examined.

Takayama et al. (1996) cloned human BAG1 cDNAs from a fetal brain cDNA
library using the mouse cDNA as a probe. The human cDNA encodes a
predicted 274-amino acid protein, 55 residues longer at the N-terminal
end than the mouse protein. The human BAG1 gene is 80% identical to the
mouse gene sequence. The human protein is also highly acidic, with a pI
of 5.3.

GENE FUNCTION

Takayama et al. (1995) found that overexpression of recombinant Bag1 in
3T3 fibroblasts prevented them from undergoing apoptosis when deprived
of serum.

Zeiner and Gehring (1995) found that recombinant RAP46 interacted with
activated glucocorticoid, androgen (AR; 313700), estrogen (see ESR1;
133430), and progesterone (PGR; 607311) receptors. Binding was dependent
on receptor activation (i.e., release from heat shock proteins), but did
not require the presence of receptor ligands. RAP46 showed a high
affinity for estrogen receptor.

Wang et al. (1996) stated that overproduction of BCL2 occurs frequently
in human cancers and contributes to tumor radio- and chemoresistance by
blocking apoptosis induced by genotoxic injury and other types of
damage. Conversely, reduced levels of BCL2 have been associated with
higher rates of spontaneous and inducible apoptosis in circulating
lymphocytes of persons infected with HIV and some other viruses. The
BCL2-interacting protein, BAG1, enhances the anti-apoptotic effects of
BCL2. Like BAG1, the serine/threonine protein kinase RAF1 (164760) also
cooperates with BCL2 in suppressing apoptosis. Wang et al. (1996) showed
that RAF1 and BAG1 specifically interact in vitro and in yeast 2-hybrid
assays. RAF1 and BAG1 proteins can also be coimmunoprecipitated from
mammalian cells and from insect cells infected with recombinant
baculoviruses encoding these proteins.

Bardelli et al. (1996) found that BAG1 represents a link between growth
factor receptors and anti-apoptotic mechanisms. They showed that BAG1
interacts with both the hepatocyte growth factor receptor (164860) and
the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (173410) and, in both cases,
enhances growth factor-mediated protection from apoptosis. The
C-terminal region of the BAG1 protein was found to be responsible for
binding to the receptors, but the entire BAG1 protein was required for
protection from apoptosis.

Kullmann et al. (1998) demonstrated that mammalian Rap46 bound the hinge
region of the glucocorticoid receptor and inhibited DNA binding and
transactivation by the receptor. Overexpression of Rap46 in mouse
thymoma cells inhibited glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis. Conversely,
treatment with rapamycin, a RAP46 downregulator, enhanced
glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis and transactivation.

Yang et al. (1999) cloned and characterized the human BAG1 gene
promoter. Functional characterization of the BAG1 promoter in vivo
demonstrated that gain-of-function p53 (191170) mutants derived from
human tumors upregulated the transcription of BAG1 RNA and the
expression of a reporter gene from the BAG1 promoter.

MAPPING

Takayama et al. (1996) assigned human BAG1 to chromosome 9 using a panel
of somatic cell hybrid DNAs and localized it to 9p12 by fluorescence in
situ hybridization.

ANIMAL MODEL

By targeted deletion of the Bag1 gene in mice, Gotz et al. (2005) showed
that Bag1 has an essential role in the survival of differentiating
neurons and hematopoietic cells. While Bag1 +/- mice were viable and
appeared normal, Bag1 -/- embryos were growth retarded by embryonic day
13.5 and died between embryonic days 12.5 and 13.5. Histologic analysis
detected abnormalities in the fetal liver and forebrain corresponding to
the onset of endogenous Bag1 expression. Fetal livers of Bag1 -/-
embryos were smaller than those of Bag1 +/- or wildtype littermates,
suggesting a defect in hematopoiesis. In the nervous system, formation
of the telencephalic vesicles was severely disturbed. TUNEL and
propidium-iodide staining indicated massive apoptosis in fetal liver and
increased apoptosis in fetal brains compared with wildtype controls.
Lack of Bag1 did not disturb the primary function of Akt (see AKT1;
164730) or Raf, but it was associated with absence of Bad (603167)
phosphorylation and disturbance of a tripartite complex formed by Akt,
Braf, and Bag1. Bag1 -/- embryos had reduced expression of members of
the inhibitor of apoptosis (see BIRC2; 601712) family.

Maeng et al. (2008) found that transgenic mice with selective
neuron-specific overexpression of Bag1 in the hippocampus did not have
obvious motor, sensory, or learning impairments, but showed less anxious
behavior and had higher spontaneous recovery rates from helplessness
behavior compared to wildtype mice. These transgenic mice also recovered
faster from tests designed to trigger hyperlocomotion or addictive
behaviors. In contrast, heterozygous Bag1 +/- mice showed enhanced
extreme behavioral responses and less recovery in similar tests. The
data suggested that BAG1 may play a role in affective resilience, and
perhaps regulates recovery from behavioral impairments observed in
patients with bipolar affective disorder (see 125480). Maeng et al.
(2008) postulated that the effects are mediated by BAG1 regulation of
glucocorticoid receptor function.

605032	TITLE *605032 COMPLEXIN 1; CPLX1
;;CPX1;;
SYNAPHIN 2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The highly specialized uptake and exocytosis system of synaptic vesicle
traffic has been studied extensively as a model of membrane fusion. The
fusion reaction begins with the assembly of a core complex consisting of
the plasma membrane proteins syntaxin (e.g., STX1A; 186590) and SNAP25
(600322) and the synaptic vesicle protein synaptobrevin (e.g., VAMP2;
185881). The core complex then serves as a soluble NSF attachment
protein (SNAP; see 603215) receptor, or SNARE. Binding of SNAP to SNARE
leads to ATP-dependent binding of NSF (601633), which subsequently
catalyzes disruption of the SNARE complex. Synaptotagmin (e.g., SYT1;
185605) triggers the final step in the fusion process, possibly via
Ca(2+)-dependent interaction with syntaxin. Complexins, such as CPLX1,
are soluble proteins that regulate SNARE function during membrane fusion
(McMahon et al., 1995).

CLONING

By immunoprecipitating the SNARE core complex from rat brain homogenates
using syntaxin antibodies, followed by SDS-PAGE analysis, McMahon et al.
(1995) identified 18- and 19-kD proteins distinct from synaptobrevin and
other members of the complex. The authors designated the 18- and 19-kD
proteins complexin-1 (CPLX1) and -2 (CPLX2; 605033), respectively. By
screening rat brain, human temporal cortex, and human hippocampus cDNA
libraries with degenerate oligonucleotides corresponding to complexin
peptide sequences, McMahon et al. (1995) isolated cDNAs encoding rat and
human CPLX1 and CPLX2. Sequence analysis determined that the rat Cplx1
and Cplx2 genes encode 134-amino acid, highly charged proteins that
share 84% amino acid identity. Asp, glu, lys, and arg account for 44 to
47% of the complexin protein residues. The amino acid sequences, but not
the nucleotide sequences, of mouse, rat, and human CPLX2 are 100%
identical. Northern blot and Western blot analyses detected abundant
expression of Cplx1 and Cplx2 in rat brain; low levels of Cplx1 were
also detected in testis, and Cplx2 was detected at low levels in all
tissues tested. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that
complexins are largely colocalized with syntaxin and SNAP25,
particularly at synapses.

Maximov et al. (2009) stated that the 134-amino acid CPX1 protein has an
N-terminal domain, followed by an accessory alpha helix (residues 27 to
46), a central alpha helix (residues 47 to 70) that binds the SNARE
complex, and a C-terminal domain.

GENE FUNCTION

Functional analysis by McMahon et al. (1995) showed that complexin
binding to syntaxin increased substantially in the presence of SNAP25
and synaptobrevin, and that it was calcium independent.

Complexins, also called synaphins, are cytosolic proteins that
preferentially bind to syntaxin within the SNARE complex. Studying squid
and rat synaphin, Tokumaru et al. (2001) found that synaphin promotes
SNAREs to form precomplexes that oligomerize into higher-order
structures. A peptide from the central, syntaxin-binding domain of
synaphin competitively inhibited these 2 proteins from interacting and
prevented SNARE complexes from oligomerizing. Injection of this peptide
into squid giant presynaptic terminals inhibited neurotransmitter
release at a late prefusion step of synaptic vesicle exocytosis.
Tokumaru et al. (2001) proposed that oligomerization of SNARE complexes
into a higher-order structure creates a SNARE scaffold for efficient,
regulated fusion of synaptic vesicles.

Reim et al. (2001) demonstrated that complexins are important regulators
of transmitter release at a step immediately preceding vesicle fusion.
Neurons from mice lacking complexins showed a dramatically reduced
transmitter release efficiency due to decreased calcium sensitivity of
the synaptic secretion process. Analyses of mutant mouse neurons
demonstrated that complexins acted at or following the
calcium-triggering step of fast synchronous transmitter release by
regulating the exocytotic calcium sensor, its interaction with the core
complex fusion machinery, or the efficiency of the fusion apparatus
itself.

Giraudo et al. (2006) described what may represent a basic principle of
the coupling mechanism between synaptic vesicle fusion and calcium: a
reversible clamping protein, complexin, that can freeze the SNAREpin, an
assembled fusion-competent intermediate, en route to fusion. When
calcium binds to the calcium sensor synaptotagmin, the clamp would be
released. SNARE proteins, and key regulators like synaptotagmin and
complexin, can be ectopically expressed on the cell surface. Cells
expressing such 'flipped' synaptic SNAREs fuse constitutively, but when
complexin was coexpressed, fusion was blocked. Adding back calcium
triggered fusion from this intermediate in the presence of
synaptotagmin.

Using biochemical approaches, Tang et al. (2006) showed that SYT1
competed with CPLX1 for SNARE complex binding in a Ca(2+)-dependent
manner. Excess CPLX1 blocked fast Ca(2+)-triggered release and
exocytosis, but not slow asynchronous release. Tang et al. (2006)
proposed that primed metastable vesicles form the substrate for SYT1,
which triggers fast synchronous release upon Ca(2+) influx by binding to
SNARE complexes, displacing CPLX1, and coupling the SNARE complex to
phospholipids.

Fusion between vesicle (v) and target (t) membrane SNAREs is favored
energetically and would occur spontaneously in the absence of inhibitory
clamping factors, such as CPX1. Giraudo et al. (2009) noted that in the
fused SNARE complex, the central helix of human CPX1 lies along the
interface between v- and t-SNAREs, making numerous contacts with both.
In contrast, the accessory helix of CPX1 lacks contacts with the SNARE
proteins in the fused complex. Using a reconstituted fusion system,
Giraudo et al. (2009) obtained evidence suggesting that the accessory
helix of CPX1 functions as an on-off switch for SNARE complex fusion. In
their model, the accessory helix assembles with the 3-helix t-SNARE as
an alternative to the v-SNARE VAMP2, preventing SNARE zippering and
membrane fusion. Activators, like synaptotagmin, would cause the
accessory helix to switch out, permitting membrane fusion.

Maximov et al. (2009) showed that complexin both suppressed spontaneous
fusion and activated fast Ca(2+)-evoked fusion in mouse neuronal
synapses. Deletion analysis showed that the N-terminal 27 amino acids of
complexin were required for fast Ca(2+)-activated fusion, and that the
accessory helix was required for clamping of spontaneous fusion. Maximov
et al. (2009) noted that the N-terminal complexin sequence lies near the
point where SNARE complexes insert into the 2 fusing membranes. They
proposed that complexin stabilizes SNARE complexes in a 'superprimed'
position, and that synaptotagmin subsequently triggers complexin
release, as well as initiating Ca(2+)-dependent phospholipid binding,
membrane fusion, and neurotransmitter release. Maximov et al. (2009)
concluded that synaptotagmin and complexin operate as interdependent
clamp-activators of SNARE-dependent fusion.

Reim et al. (2001) created deletion mutations in the murine Cplx1 and
Cplx2 genes and homozygous single and double mutants with their
respective controls. They found that mice lacking Cplx2 showed no
obvious phenotypic changes. In contrast, homozygous Cplx1 deletion
mutants developed a strong ataxia, suffered from sporadic seizures, were
unable to reproduce, and died within 2 to 4 months after birth. Although
loss of Cplx1 was ultimately fatal, the fact that mice lacking either
Cplx1 or Cplx2 lived for at least 2 months after birth indicated that
Cplx1 and Cplx2 are partially redundant. They therefore generated double
mutants lacking both Cplx isoforms. Homozygous Cplx1/2 double mutants
died within a few hours after birth. In order to detect possible
developmental changes or alterations in brain structure due to Cplx
deletion mutations, Reim et al. (2001) analyzed morphologic
characteristics of brains from homozygous adult Cplx1 and Cplx2 single
mutants as well as newborn Cplx1/2 double mutants.

Glynn et al. (2005) found that Cplx1 -/- mice showed pronounced deficits
in motor coordination and locomotion including abnormal gait, inability
to run or swim, impaired rotarod performance, reduced neuromuscular
strength, dystonia, and resting tremor. Although the abnormal motor
phenotype dominated their overt symptoms, Cplx1 -/- mice also showed
behavioral deficits in complex such as grooming, rearing on hindlimbs,
and reduced exploration in several different paradigms. They also showed
deficits in tasks reflecting emotional reactivity. They failed to
habituate to confinement and showed a 'panic' response when exposed to
water. Behavioral deficits of Cplx1 -/- mice reflected those predicted
from the distribution of complexin I in the brain. Glynn et al. (2005)
concluded that complexin I is essential not only for normal motor
function in mice, but also for normal performance of other complex
behaviors.

Drew et al. (2007) found that juvenile Cplx1-null mice showed no
evidence of cognitive impairment. However, Cplx1-null mice failed in the
social transmission of food preference task due to abnormal social
interactions rather than due to cognitive impairments or increased
anxiety. Cplx1-null mice also failed to demonstrate a preference for
social novelty, and male Cplx1-null failed to show the aggressive
behavior that is typical of wildtype males toward an intruder mouse. The
results showed that, in addition to the severe motor and exploratory
deficits already described, Cplx1-null mice have pronounced deficits in
social behaviors.

603485	TITLE *603485 NITROGEN FIXATION GENE 1; NFS1
;;NITROGEN-FIXING BACTERIA S, HOMOLOG OF; NIFS;;
CYSTEINE DESULFURASE;;
ISCS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters are prosthetic groups found in respiratory
chain complexes and numerous mitochondrial and cytosolic enzymes.
Assembly of Fe-S clusters requires cysteine desulfurases, such as NFS1,
as well as scaffold proteins, iron donors, and chaperones (Li et al.,
2006).

CLONING

Using sequence homology to bacterial NifS, Land and Rouault (1998)
cloned the human homolog of NifS, a cysteine desulfurase that is
proposed to supply the inorganic sulfur in iron-sulfur clusters. In
human cells, different forms of NIFS that localize either to
mitochondria or to the cytosol and nucleus are synthesized from a single
transcript through initiation at alternative in-frame AUGs, and
initiation site selection varies according to the pH of the medium or
cytosol. Thus, this form of translational regulation permits rapid
redistribution of NIFS proteins into different compartments of the cell
in response to changes in metabolic status.

GENE FUNCTION

Li et al. (2006) overexpressed the cytosolic isoform of human ISCS in
yeast and showed that it was an active cysteine desulfurase that
converted cysteine to alanine and covalently bound sulfur in a
persulfide. Cytosolic ISCS homodimerized and formed a complex in vitro
with overexpressed human cytosolic ISCU (611911). When incubated with
iron regulatory protein-1 (IRP1, or ACO1; 100880), cysteine, and iron,
the cytosolic isoforms of ISCS and ISCU facilitated efficient formation
of a 4Fe-4S cluster on IRP1.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the NFS1
gene to chromosome 20pter-p12.3 (TMAP SGC32196).

;;KIR2.4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Members of the inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channel family are
characterized by a channel structure with 2 transmembrane segments
surrounding putative pore loop. The Kir2 subfamily contains channels
characterized by their strong current rectification. By screening a rat
brain library with a bovine PCR fragment based on a human Kir-like EST
(GenBank GENBANK W25800), Topert et al. (1998) isolated a cDNA encoding
Kir2.4, a Kir2 subfamily member. In situ hybridization revealed that
Kir2.4 is expressed predominantly in motoneurons of cranial nerve motor
nuclei within the general somatic and special visceral motor cell
column. The unique Kir2.4 expression pattern and in situ measurements of
the functional characteristics of Kir2.4 in rat brainstem led the
authors to conclude that these channels serve an important function in
controlling the excitability of brainstem motoneurons. Northern blot
analysis revealed that Kir2.4 is expressed specifically in human brain.

610809	TITLE *610809 TBC1 DOMAIN FAMILY, MEMBER 3F; TBC1D3F
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By genomic sequence analysis, Hodzic et al. (2006) identified 8 paralogs
of the TBC1D3 gene (see 607741) on chromosome 17, including TBC1D3F,
which they called paralog E. All TBC1D3 paralogs encode a deduced
549-amino acid protein, but missense changes at 6 residues among the
paralogs result in 5 different TBC1D3 isoforms. The TBC1D3F and TBC1D3E
(610808) genes encode identical proteins. The TBC1D3 paralogs appeared
to be differentially expressed in human tissues.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Hodzic et al. (2006) identified 8 TBC1D3
paralogs, including the TBC1D3E gene, on chromosome 17q12. The paralogs
are clustered in 2 groups of 4 genes, and each cluster spans
approximately 400 kb.

;;GROWTH ARREST-SPECIFIC 11, FORMERLY; GAS11, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Loss of heterozygosity involving chromosome 16q24.3 is common in breast
and prostate cancer and suggests the presence of a tumor suppressor
gene. Whitmore et al. (1998) characterized a transcript located in the
smallest region of deletion. The authors used trapped exons homologous
to a mouse growth arrest-specific (gas) cDNA from the deleted region to
identify a human homolog. RT-PCR resulted in the assembly of a 1,434-bp
open reading frame encoding a 478-amino acid putative protein. The human
GAS11 amino acid sequence is 96% identical to that of the mouse homolog;
the 3- and 5-prime untranslated regions, however, differ completely
between the 2 species. Northern blot analysis detected 2 ubiquitously
expressed major bands of 3.4 and 1.8 kb, as well as a 7.3-kb band in
heart and skeletal muscle and a 1.4-kb band in skeletal muscle alone.

GENE FUNCTION

In protist, ciliary motility is controlled by the dynein regulatory
complex (DRC), which regulates axonemal dynein activity in response to
signals from the radial spokes and central pair apparatus (reviewed by
Colantonio et al., 2009). The DRC subunit trypanin is conserved across
diverse phyla; the human trypanin homolog, GAS8, is a
microtubule-binding protein localized to regions of dynein regulation in
mammalian cells. Colantonio et al. (2009) identified zebrafish gas8,
which encodes a protein that is 63.8% identical to human GAS8. Zebrafish
gas8 is expressed in ciliated tissues during organogenesis. Colantonio
et al. (2009) demonstrated that gas8 is required for normal motility of
cilia in the otic vesicle and that ciliary motility is essential for
normal ear development.

GENE STRUCTURE

Whitmore et al. (1998) found that the 25-kb GAS8 gene contains 11 exons
separated by 10 introns. Intron 2 contains another gene, C16ORF3
(chromosome 16 open reading frame 3; 605179), which is intronless,
transcribed in the opposite orientation, and expressed at low levels.

MAPPING

Whitmore et al. (1998) identified the GAS8 gene within a region of
chromosome 16q24.3 commonly deleted in human carcinomas.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Whitmore et al. (1998) performed mutational analysis by SSCA and found
no nucleotide base changes in either the GAS8 or the C16ORF3 gene
between 17 primary tumors and their corresponding matched normal DNA.

125255	TITLE *125255 DECORIN; DCN
;;PROTEOGLYCAN II;;
PG II;;
PG40
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Decorin and biglycan (301870) are related but distinct small
proteoglycans found in many connective tissues. Using Northern blot
analysis or RT-PCR, Danielson et al. (1993) detected the 2 alternatively
spliced leader exons of the DCN gene in a variety of mRNAs isolated from
human cell lines and tissues. Sequences highly homologous (74-87%) to
exons Ia and Ib were found in the 5-prime untranslated region of avian
and bovine decorin, respectively. This high degree of conservation among
species suggested regulatory functions for these leader exons. In situ
hybridization studies of developing mouse embryos suggested that decorin
may play a role in epithelial/mesenchymal interactions during organ
development and shaping (Scholzen et al., 1994).

GENE STRUCTURE

Danielson et al. (1993) found that the human decorin gene spans more
than 38 kb and contains 8 exons and very large introns, 2 of which are
5.4 and more than 13.2 kb. They discovered 2 alternatively spliced
leader exons, Ia and Ib, in the 5-prime untranslated region.

MAPPING

By Southern analysis of a panel of human-rodent somatic cell hybrid DNAs
with cDNA probes, McBride et al. (1990) assigned the DCN gene to
chromosome 12. Regionalization to 12p12.1-qter was obtained by examining
hybrids containing spontaneous breaks or well-characterized
translocations involving chromosome 12. Hybridization with subfragment
cDNA probes suggested the presence of 2 copies of the DCN gene, or
related sequences, at the locus on chromosome 12, although there was no
evidence for the function of more than one DCN gene. By in situ
hybridization, Pulkkinen et al. (1992) placed the DCN gene at 12q21-q22.
Vetter et al., (1993) mapped the human decorin gene by in situ
hybridization to 12q21.3. Using a genomic clone as the labeled probe and
in situ hybridization, Danielson et al. (1993) mapped the DCN gene to
12q23. They specifically noted that there were 4 times as many grains
centered on 12q23 as on 12q21, where Pulkkinen et al. (1992) had placed
the probable site. In a study of candidate genes for Noonan syndrome
(163950), Ion et al. (2000) reassigned the map position of DCN to
12q13.2 using FISH. Scholzen et al. (1994) assigned the homologous gene
in the mouse to chromosome 10, using interspecific backcrossing.

GENE FUNCTION

Vogel and Clark (1989) found little evidence that the metabolism of
either decorin or biglycan is altered by abnormalities in the structure
or secretion of types I and III collagen. In a presumably homozygous
case of the Marfan syndrome (154700) reported by Schollin et al. (1988),
Pulkkinen et al. (1990) found markedly decreased level of mRNA for
decorin, markedly decreased decorin polypeptide in the culture medium of
fibroblasts from the infant, and deficient effect of interleukin-1-beta
(147720) on the transcription of decorin as tested in these fibroblasts.
In 3 of 12 other unrelated Marfan patients, they also found deficient
decorin expression.

Dyne et al. (1996) studied 2 patients with osteogenesis imperfecta and
the same gly415-to-ser mutation of the COL1A1 gene (120150.0044), but a
different clinical expression. They speculated that these differences
could be the result of abnormalities in other connective tissue
proteins. Since decorin is a component of connective tissue, binds to
type I collagen fibrils, and plays a role in matrix assembly, they
studied decorin production in skin fibroblasts from these 2 patients.
Cultured fibroblasts from the patient with extremely severe osteogenesis
imperfecta (classified as type II/III) were found to secrete barely
detectable amounts of decorin into culture medium. Northern blot
analysis showed decorin mRNA levels below the limit of detection. The
patient with a less severe phenotype had fibroblasts that expressed
decorin normally. Dyne et al. (1996) suggested that the different
clinical phenotypes could be due to the differing genetic backgrounds of
the patients, such that in the more severely affected patient the
absence of decorin aggravated the clinical phenotype.

When expressed ectopically, decorin is capable of suppressing the growth
of various tumor cell lines. Moscatello et al. (1998) demonstrated that
it induced a marked growth suppression in A431 squamous carcinoma cells,
when either exogenously added or endogenously produced by a transgene.
Decorin caused rapid phosphorylation of the EGF receptor (131550) and a
concurrent activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signal
pathway. Thus, EGF and decorin converge functionally to regulate the
cell cycle through activation of a common pathway that ultimately leads
to growth suppression.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a family with congenital stromal corneal dystrophy (CSCD; 610048),
Bredrup et al. (2005) identified a heterozygous 1-bp deletion in the
last exon, which they erroneously labeled exon 10 (Rodahl, 2009), of the
DCN gene (125255.0001). The deletion was found in all affected family
members but not in any healthy family member or in 200 normal controls.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001

DCN, 1-BP DEL, 967T

In a Norwegian family originally reported by Odland (1968) with
congenital stromal corneal dystrophy (CSCD; 610048), Bredrup et al.
(2005) identified a heterozygous 1-bp deletion (967delT) in the last
exon, which they erroneously labeled exon 10 (Rodahl, 2009), of the DCN
gene. The mutation was predicted to lead to a frameshift, alteration of
4 amino acids, and loss of the C-terminal 33 amino acids (S323fsX5).
Bredrup et al. (2005) postulated that the defective interaction of
mutant decorin with collagen would disturb the regularity of corneal
collagen in affected heterozygotes.

613022	TITLE *613022 OXOGLUTARATE DEHYDROGENASE; OGDH
;;ALPHA-KETOGLUTARATE DEHYDROGENASE; AKGDH;;
E1K
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex is a multienzyme complex
consisting of 3 protein subunits, oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, also known
as alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase or E1k (EC 1.2.4.2.), dihydrolipoyl
succinyltransferase (DLST, or E2k; 126063), and dihydrolipoyl
dehydrogenase (DLD, or E3; 238331). The complex catalyzes a key reaction
in the Krebs tricarboxylic acid cycle (summary by Szabo et al., 1994).

CLONING

Koike et al. (1992) cloned a human OGDH cDNA from a fetal liver cDNA
library. The ORF encodes a presequence of 40 amino acids and a mature
protein of 963 amino acids with a molecular mass of 108,642 daltons. It
is located in mitochondria within the inner membrane/matrix compartment.

GENE STRUCTURE

Koike (1995) found that the human OGDH gene contains 22 exons spanning
approximately 85 kb. All exon/intron splice junctions follow the GT/AG
rule. Primary extension analysis showed that the OGDH transcription
start point is a thymine residue 55 bp upstream from the ATG start
codon. The 5-prime-flanking region lacked canonical TATA or CAAT boxes.

MAPPING

Using 2 human/rodent somatic cell hybrid panels, Szabo et al. (1994)
mapped the OGDH gene to 7p13-p11.2. A second related sequence, possibly
a pseudogene, was identified and mapped to chromosome 10.

Using DNAs from human/rodent somatic cell hybrids in conjunction with
fluorescence in situ hybridization, Koike (1995) assigned the OGDH gene
to the boundary between bands 7p13 and 7p14.

GENE FUNCTION

Oxoglutarate dehydrogenase is a component of the enzyme complex that
catalyzes the conversion of 2-oxoglutarate to succinyl coenzyme A (Koike
et al., 1992).

Szabo et al. (1994) pointed to a possible significance to the finding of
a reduction in the activity of this complex in Alzheimer disease brain
and cultured skin fibroblasts from Alzheimer disease patients.

See 203740 for a discussion of alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase
deficiency.

;;PUR-BETA
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By probing a HeLa cell cDNA library with a fragment of the PURA (600473)
sequence, Bergemann et al. (1992) identified a partial sequence of a
homologous cDNA, designated PURB, encoding a protein with a 23-amino
acid class I motif and an amphipathic helix similar to those found in
PURA.

Kelm et al. (1997) cloned mouse Purb (p44) and Pura (p46) and identified
them as the 2 components of the previously designated vascular actin
single-stranded DNA-binding factor-2, which specifically bound to
purine-rich regions within an enhancer and an exon of vascular actin
(Kelm et al., 1996). Like Pura, the deduced 324-amino acid Purb protein
contains class I and class II repeats and a 23-amino acid PSYC motif
that is homologous to the Rb-binding region of SV-40 large T antigen.
Purb differs from Pura in that the second class II repeat is interrupted
by a glycine-rich region, the N-terminal glycine-rich region is
interrupted by a 6-amino acid region, and there is no glutamine-rich
C-terminal region.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ATP2C1 is a Golgi-localized ATPase that mediates Golgi uptake of
cytosolic Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) and has a role in regulating Ca(2+) and
Mn(2+) cellular content (Ton et al., 2002).

CLONING

Hu et al. (2000) identified an EST corresponding to the ATP2C1 gene
within a 1.3-Mb YAC/BAC contig spanning the region of chromosome
3q21-q24 deleted in a family with Hailey-Hailey disease (HHD; 169600).
This EST had been annotated as homologous to a yeast gene encoding a
calcium ATPase with a function predicted to be related to that of SERCA2
(ATP2A2; 108740). Hu et al. (2000) isolated the full-length cDNA
corresponding to the human EST. Similar to other Ca(2+) ATPase genes,
the ATP2C1 gene encodes 2 alternatively spliced transcripts, ATP2C1a and
ATP2C1b. These transcripts differed in their C termini (encoding amino
acids 877 to the end), but had the same expression patterns in all
tissues examined. ATP2C1a was predicted to encode 919 amino acids, and
ATP2C1b was predicted to encode 888 amino acids. The protein encoded by
ATP2C1 was highly homologous (97% identity) to rat Pmr1, which in turn
is homologous to the yeast calcium pump Pmr1, but less homologous to
other calcium pumps. Northern blot analysis detected a 4.4-kb ATP2C1
transcript in keratinocytes and in all 12 whole tissues examined.
Highest expression was in kidney and heart, and lowest expression was in
colon, thymus, and leukocytes. Patients with HHD are not known to have
extracutaneous manifestations of the disease. Hu et al. (2000) found no
differences in ATP2C1 mRNA levels between skin taken from the axilla and
skin from the buttock (sites particularly prone vs resistant to
blistering, respectively, in HHD patients) of one normal individual and
little change in ATP2C1 mRNA levels in normal human epidermal
keratinocytes cultured with glucocorticoid.

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned ATP2C1 clone, which they designated
KIAA1347. The deduced 918-amino acid protein shares 97% identity with
its rat ortholog, a calcium-transporting ATPase. RT-PCR ELISA detected
variable ATP2C1 expression in all adult and fetal tissues examined, with
highest expression in ovary, followed by lung, testis, brain, liver, and
kidney. Within specific adult brain regions, highest expression was
detected in thalamus, followed by amygdala and substantia nigra.

Ton et al. (2002) showed that epitope-tagged human SPCA1 localized to
the Golgi compartment following expression in yeast and Chinese hamster
ovary cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hu et al. (2000) detected 27 exons in the ATP2C1 gene. Dobson-Stone et
al. (2002) detected 28 translated exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the ATP2C1
gene to chromosome 3. Hu et al. (2000) mapped the ATP2C1 gene to
chromosome 3q21-q24.

GENE FUNCTION

Pmr1, the yeast ortholog of SPCA1, is expressed in the Golgi compartment
and functions as a high-affinity Ca(2+)/Mn(2+) pump involved in Ca(2+)
and Mn(2+) secretion. Deletion of Pmr1 in yeast causes hypersensitivity
to Ca(2+) chelators and Mn(2+) toxicity, with defects in protein
glycosylation, processing, sorting, and endoplasmic reticulum
(ER)-related glycosylation. Ton et al. (2002) found that heterologous
expression of human SPCA1, but not SERCA-type Ca(2+)-transporting
ATPases, reduced Mn(2+) toxicity and complemented Ca(2+)-related
phenotypes in Pmr1-null yeast. Yeast Golgi vesicles expressing human
SPCA1 showed high-affinity Ca(2+) transport activity that was
inhibitable by Mn(2+), but not by thapsigargin, an inhibitor of
SERCA-type ATPases. Ton et al. (2002) proposed that SPCA1 plays a role
in maintaining Ca(2+) and Mn(2+) concentrations in Golgi and the
secretory pathway.

Using RNA interference with HeLa cells, Van Baelen et al. (2003) showed
that SPCA1 was completely responsible for thapsigargin-insensitive
Ca(2+) uptake into Golgi vesicles. Knockdown of SPCA1 did not alter
Ca(2+) handling in the ER and had only a small effect on baseline
histamine-induced Ca(2+) oscillations in whole cells.

Mukhopadhyay and Linstedt (2011) found that exposure of HeLa cells to
increased extracellular Mn(2+), but not Ca(2+), induced trafficking of
the Golgi phosphoprotein GPP130 (GOLIM4; 606805) from the Golgi to
multivesicular bodies and then to lysosomes, followed by GPP130
degradation. They showed that a gln747-to-ala (Q747A) point mutation in
SPCA1 increased Golgi uptake of cellular Mn(2+), leading to increased
GPP130 degradation and reduced Mn(2+) toxicity via secretion. In
contrast, SPCA1 containing either an asp350-to-ala (D350A) mutation,
which blocks autophosphorylation and transport of Mn(2+) and Ca(2+), or
a gly309-to-cys (G309C) mutation, which blocks transport of Mn(2+), but
not Ca(2+), reduced Golgi uptake of Mn(2+), resulting in reduced GPP130
degradation and increased Mn(2+) toxicity.

Kourtis et al. (2012) demonstrated that heat stroke triggers pervasive
necrotic cell death and neurodegeneration in C. elegans. Preconditioning
of animals at a mildly elevated temperature strongly protected from
heat-induced necrosis. The heat-shock transcription factor HSF1 (140580)
and the small heat-shock protein HSP-16.1 mediate cytoprotection by
preconditioning. HSP-16.1 localizes to the Golgi, where it functions
with the calcium- and magnesium-transporting ATPase PMR1 to maintain
calcium homeostasis under heat stroke. Preconditioning also suppresses
cell death inflicted by diverse insults, and protects mammalian neurons
from heat cytotoxicity. Kourtis et al. (2012) concluded that their
findings revealed an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that defends
against diverse necrotic stimuli. In mouse cortical neurons and striatal
cells, Kourtis et al. (2012) found that overexpression of crystallin
alpha-A (123580), which colocalizes with the Golgi marker
alpha-mannosidase-II (154582) and the PMR1 ATPase, was sufficient to
protect mammalian neurons from heat stroke-induced death, even in the
absence of preconditioning. Heat stroke caused massive necrotic death
and axonal degeneration in neurons expressing short hairpin RNAs against
Pmr1, even after preconditioning.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Hailey-Hailey disease (HHD; 169600) is an autosomal dominant disorder
characterized by persistent blisters and erosions of the skin. By family
linkage studies, the HHD region was localized to 3q21-q24. Study of a
family carrying a deletion helped narrow the location. To screen HHD
patients for ATP2C1 mutations, Hu et al. (2000) identified intron sites
by comparison of genomic and cDNA sequences, designed primers flanking
the 27 identified exons, and assessed PCR products from patients and
controls by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) or
conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE) analyses. Among 51
unrelated kindreds of European descent and 10 of Japanese descent, they
identified 21 abnormalities (16/51 and 5/10). Of the abnormal sequences,
6 predicted single amino acid substitutions, 2 predicted aberrant
splicing, and 13 predicted prematurely truncated products through
frameshifts or single-basepair substitution. A high frequency of the
last type of mutation supported a haploinsufficiency pathogenesis
consistent with the complete deletion of the gene in 1 kindred and
further suggested that calcium pumps of the PMR1 family function as
monomers. The mechanism by which mutant ATPC1 causes acantholysis is
unknown, but it may be through abnormally elevated cytoplasmic calcium
or abnormally low Golgi Ca(2+) levels. Elevated cytoplasmic calcium
might act by altering posttranslational modification of proteins or by
inducing changes in gene expression.

Sudbrak et al. (2000) identified 13 different mutations, including
nonsense, frameshift insertion and deletions, splice-site mutations, and
nonconservative missense mutations, in ATP2C1 in patients with
Hailey-Hailey disease. The identification of ATP2A2 as the gene
defective in Darier disease (124200) provided further evidence of the
critical role of Ca(2+) signaling in maintaining epidermal integrity.

Ikeda et al. (2001) reported ATP2C1 mutations in 11 Japanese patients
with Hailey-Hailey disease. Some affected individuals had unique
clinical features (generalization of Hailey-Hailey disease and
generalized skin eruption resembling keratotic papules in Darier
disease), but other affected individuals did not, suggesting the
presence of intrafamilial phenotypic variations. These findings
reinforced the conclusion that differences in clinical phenotypes in
Hailey-Hailey disease are probably related to factors other than the
type of causative mutation.

Chao et al. (2002) identified 7 different ATP2C1 mutations, 6 of them
novel, in 7 Taiwanese kindreds with Hailey-Hailey disease. They found 3
deletion mutations, 2 nonsense mutations, 1 missense mutation, and 1
splicing mutation.

Dobson-Stone et al. (2002) screened all 28 translated exons of ATP2C1 in
24 Hailey-Hailey disease families and 3 sporadic cases and identified 22
mutations (18 novel) in 25 probands. The novel mutations comprised 3
nonsense, 6 insertion/deletion, 3 splice site, and 6 missense mutations,
and were distributed throughout the ATP2C1 gene. They noted that 6 of
the mutations were found in multiple families in their study as well as
in the studies of Sudbrak et al. (2000) and Hu et al. (2000). Haplotype
analysis revealed that 2 of these were recurrent mutations. Comparison
between genotype and phenotype in 23 families failed to yield any clear
correlation between the nature of the mutation and clinical features of
Hailey-Hailey disease. The extensive inter- and intrafamilial phenotypic
variability suggested that modifying genes and/or environmental factors
may greatly influence the clinical features of this disease.

In a patient with unilateral segmental exacerbations of Hailey-Hailey
disease, Poblete-Gutierrez et al. (2004) identified heterozygosity for a
splice site mutation in exon 22 of the ATP2C1 gene (604384.0009).
Haplotype analysis of the more severely affected segmental skin regions
revealed consistent loss of the paternal wildtype allele, confirming the
authors' hypothesis that such segmental exacerbations represent a form
of mosaicism with hemizygosity for the mutation.

insertion resulted in a frameshift with a premature termination codon 42
amino acids downstream of the mutation.

In a family with Hailey-Hailey disease (169600), Hu et al. (2000)
identified a G-to-T transversion of nucleotide 910 of the ATP2C1 gene,
resulting in an ala304-to-thr amino acid substitution.

.0003
HAILEY-HAILEY DISEASE
ATP2C1, ARG468TER

In a family with Hailey-Hailey disease (169600), Hu et al. (2000) found
a 1402C-T transition in the ATP2C1 gene that altered codon 468 from
arginine to stop.

.0004
HAILEY-HAILEY DISEASE
ATP2C1, 4-BP DEL, 2374TTTG

In 2 unrelated families with Hailey-Hailey disease (169600), Hu et al.
(2000) found an identical 4-bp deletion of 2374delTTTG in the ATP2C1
gene. The 2 families had different alleles of the D3S1587 marker, a
locus less than 100 kb from the mutant gene, on the mutant chromosome.
This may indicate that these were independent mutations. The deletion
resulted in a premature termination codon 10 amino acids downstream of
the mutation.

HAILEY-HAILEY DISEASE
ATP2C1, IVS11, G-A, -1

Sudbrak et al. (2000) identified a G-to-A transition at the 3-prime end
of intron 11 (nucleotide position 852) of the ATP2C1 gene in a family
with Hailey-Hailey disease (169600). The effect on the cDNA was not
determined.

In a Japanese patient who represented a sporadic occurrence of
Hailey-Hailey disease (169600), Yokota et al. (2002) reported a

ATP2C1, LEU584PRO

In a Japanese patient who represented a sporadic occurrence of
Hailey-Hailey disease (169600), Yokota et al. (2002) reported a T-to-C
transition at nucleotide 1751 in exon 19 of the ATP2C1 gene, resulting
in a leu584-to-pro (L584P) amino acid substitution.

.0009
HAILEY-HAILEY DISEASE
ATP2C1, IVS22, G-A, +1

In a patient with unilateral segmental exacerbations of Hailey-Hailey
disease (169600), originally reported by Vakilzadeh and Kolde (1985),
Poblete-Gutierrez et al. (2004) identified heterozygosity for a G-to-A
transition at the first base of the consensus splice donor site of exon
22 of the ATP2C1 gene. The mutation, which they designated 2146+1G-A,
resulted in the skipping of the 69-bp exon 22. Haplotype analysis of the
more severely affected segmental skin regions revealed consistent loss
of the paternal wildtype allele, confirming the authors' hypothesis that
such segmental exacerbations represent a form of mosaicism with
hemizygosity for the mutation.

614072	TITLE #614072 HERMANSKY-PUDLAK SYNDROME 3; HPS3
DESCRIPTION A number sign (#) is used with this entry because this form of
Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, HPS3, is caused by homozygous or compound
heterozygous mutation in the HPS3 gene (606118) on chromosome 3q24.

For a phenotypic description and a discussion of genetic heterogeneity
of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, see HPS1, 203300.

CLINICAL FEATURES

Hazelwood et al. (1997) ascertained 2 individuals with Hermansky-Pudlak
syndrome from central Puerto Rico who lacked the 16-bp duplication
(604982.0001), exhibited significant amounts of normal-size HPS1 gene
mRNA by Northern blot analysis, and had haplotypes in the HPS1 region of
chromosome 10 that were different from the haplotype of every 16-bp
duplication patient. Moreover, these 2 individuals displayed no
mutations in their HPS1 cDNA sequences. Both patients exhibited pigment
dilution, impaired visual acuity, nystagmus, bleeding diathesis, and
absent platelet dense bodies, confirming the diagnosis of HPS. The
findings appear to indicate locus heterogeneity of this disorder in
Puerto Rico, consistent with the existence of several mouse strains
manifesting both pigment dilution and a platelet storage-pool
deficiency.

By examining 6 families from Aibonito, Naranjito, and Barranquitas,
rural towns south of San Juan, Anikster et al. (2001) identified a
second genetic isolate of HPS in central Puerto Rico. Thirteen affected
individuals had a bleeding diathesis, horizontal nystagmus, decreased
vision, and very mild pigment dilution of hair, skin, and irides. The
diagnosis of HPS was confirmed by demonstrating an absence of
platelet-dense bodies using wet-mount electron microscopy. All patients
lacked the 16-bp duplication in HPS1.

MAPPING

Anikster et al. (2001) used homozygosity mapping on pooled DNA of 6
families from central Puerto Rico to localize the HPS3 gene to a 1.6-cM
interval on chromosome 3q24.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Anikster et al. (2001) identified a homozygous mutation in the HPS3 gene
(606118.0001) on chromosome 3q24 in families within central Puerto Rico,
some members of which had been studied by Hazelwood et al. (1997). They
stated that this was the second example of a founder mutation causing
HPS in central Puerto Rico. They estimated that the large deletion in
the HPS3 gene arose between 1880 and 1890. At that time the ancestors of
3 of the 6 HPS3 families emigrated from the town of Ciales to the towns
of Aibonito, Barranquitas, and Naranjito. Each of the 3 families also
traced its ancestry to 1 individual, Calixto Rivera, who brought his
relatives to Aibonito and the surrounding area to deforest his land for
tobacco growing.

Ebersole et al. (1996) identified several splice variants of mouse Qki
that could be grouped into 2 classes based on size. The longer mRNAs (7,
6, and 5 kb) were abundant in mouse brain, whereas the shorter mRNAs
(1.5 to 1.9 kb) were less abundant. The longer variants encode deduced
proteins containing an N-terminal proline-rich domain, followed by 2 RG
boxes, a second proline-rich region, a central GSG/STAR domain, a third
proline-rich domain, and 5 tyrosines preceding alternative C-terminal
ends. The GSG domain consists of a KH domain flanked by evolutionarily
conserved quaking (QUA) domains 1 and 2. Qki also has 7 SH3-binding
sites dispersed throughout its sequence. Qki expression peaked in
16-day-old myelinating mouse brain. A splice variant was also detected
in newborn testis. In situ hybridization of normal mouse brain showed
Qki transcripts in myelinating tracts in the cerebellum. Ebersole et al.
(1996) identified multiple QKI transcripts in human, rodent, chicken,
and frog.

By Northern blot analysis, Hardy et al. (1996) found that the 5-, 6-,
and 7-kb Qki mRNAs, which they designated Qki-5, Qki-6, and Qki-7,
respectively, were variably expressed in developing and adult mouse
brain. Levels of Qki-5 declined dramatically after the second postnatal
week, whereas levels of Qki-6 and Qki-7 declined modestly thereafter.
Immunohistochemical analysis detected all 3 proteins in myelinating
cells of the central and peripheral nervous system and in astrocytes.
The isoforms showed distinct intracellular distributions, however, with
Qki-6 and Qki-7 localized to perikaryal cytoplasm and Qki-5 restricted
to nucleus.

Noveroske et al. (2002) found that Qki was expressed in the yolk sac
endoderm in mice, adjacent to developing blood islands.

Using quantitative RT-PCR, Lauriat et al. (2008) found that QKI-5 showed
no significant differences in expression across various age groups in
human prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus. However, QKI-5 was the
only QKI variant expressed at high levels in fetal PFC. QKI-6 expression
increased in PFC in a linear fashion with age, with a substantial
increase between 1 to 2 months and 1 to 2 years of age. In human
hippocampus, QKI-6 expression increased at 1 to 2 years of age, remained
high during childhood, and decreased in adulthood. QKI-7a generally
showed a linear trend toward increased expression in PFC with age, but
there was a peak at 1 to 2 years of age. QKI-7b expression in PFC did
not vary significantly with age due to greater variability between
individuals, but there was a trend toward an increase with age. In
hippocampus, QKI-7a and QKI-7b showed a trend toward decreased
expression in adulthood, similar to QKI-6, but there was greater
variability between individuals. Lauriat et al. (2008) noted that
expression of QKI-6 and QKI-7 in PFC increased during the period of
active myelination.

By sequencing mRNAs expressed in primary cultures of human astrocytes,
Radomska et al. (2013) identified QKI5, QKI6, QKI7, QKI7b, and a novel
variant that they called QKI6b. QKI6b differs from other QKI variants in
the 3-prime UTR and encodes a protein identical to that encoded by QKI6.
QKI6 and QKI6b were the most abundant QKI transcripts detected in human
astrocytes, and QKI5 was the least abundant. Immunohistochemical
analysis with isoform-specific antibodies revealed that QKI6 and QKI7
were uniformly distributed throughout the nucleus, cell body, and
processes, whereas QKI5 localized to nuclei and was excluded from
nucleoli. Western blot analysis detected QKI6 at an apparent molecular
mass of 38 kD. Both QKI5 and QKI7 had apparent molecular masses of about
40 kD.

GENE STRUCTURE

Backx et al. (2010) noted that the QKI gene contains 8 exons.

MAPPING

Backx et al. (2010) stated that the QKI gene maps to chromosome 6q26.

The mouse Qki gene maps to chromosome 17 (Ebersole et al., 1996).

GENE FUNCTION

Chen and Richard (1998) showed that the mouse Qk1 proteins homodimerized
in vivo, and they determined that the GSG domain mediated dimerization
and RNA binding. Self-association was mediated by a region of QUA1
predicted to form coiled coils.

Larocque et al. (2002) found that mouse Qk1 proteins bound a short
element in the 3-prime UTR of Mbp (159430). The balance between the
nuclear and cytoplasmic isoforms of Qk1 controlled the nuclear export of
Mbp mRNAs and the cellular localization of the 17- and 21.5-kD Mbp
isoforms. Overexpression of Qki-5 in cultured rodent oligodendrocytes
recreated the Mbp defects observed in qk(v) mice, with retention of Mbp
in the nucleus. Larocque et al. (2002) concluded that the QKI proteins
have a role in myelination.

In an mRNA analysis of 55 control human brains, Aberg et al. (2006)
found that QKI mRNA levels accounted for 47% of the coordinated
variation of mRNA levels of 6 oligodendrocyte-related genes, PLP1
(300401), MAG (159460), MBP, TF (190000), SOX10 (602229), and CDKN1B
(600778). In silico analysis identified potential QKI-binding sites in
all of the genes except TF. Variation in the relative expression of
splice variant QKI-7 explained a large fraction of additional mRNA
variation in 3 highly coexpressed genes, MAG, PLP1, and TF. Analysis of
55 brains from patients with schizophrenia (see 181500) showed
significantly decreased expression of MAG, PLP1, and TF compared to
control brains that was associated with decreased levels of QKI-7. Aberg
et al. (2006) concluded that QKI is a regulator of oligodendrocyte
differentiation and maturation in the human brain, and suggested that
splice variants of QKI may play a role in myelin and oligodendrocyte
dysfunction in schizophrenia.

Using yeast 2-hybrid screens, coaffinity purification analysis of
transfected HEK293 cells, and bioinformatic analysis, Lim et al. (2006)
developed an interaction network for 54 human proteins involved in 23
inherited ataxias. By database analysis, they expanded the core network
to include more distantly related interacting proteins that could
function as genetic modifiers. RBPMS (601558) was a main hub in the
network and interacted with many proteins, including the cerebellar
ataxia-associated proteins ATN1 (607462) and QK1.

Using a rat cell line and primary mixed glial cultures from neonatal rat
brain, Chen et al. (2007) showed that Qk1 was necessary and sufficient
for oligodendroglia progenitor cell differentiation. Qk1 isoforms 5, 6,
and 7 differed in their ability to promote oligodendroglia
differentiation, which was dependent on the RNA-binding ability of Qk1.
RNA interference-mediated Qk1 knockdown abrogated differentiation
without affecting proliferation capacity or cell cycle progression.

Using qualitative RT-PCR, Lauriat et al. (2008) examined expression of
putative QKI target mRNAs, including MAGI1 (602625), BCAS1 (602968),
CDKN1B, PLP1, and MAG, in human prefrontal cortex and hippocampus from
fetus to adulthood (up to 46 years of age). Most of the putative QKI
target mRNAs showed increased expression with increasing age in
prefrontal cortex. However, there was little evidence of developmental
regulation of these mRNAs in hippocampus.

Using small interfering RNA, Radomska et al. (2013) found that knockdown
of QKI7 in cultured human astrocytes reduced expression of an astrocyte
differentiation marker, GFAP (137780), but did not reduce cell
viability. The dominant GFAP variant expressed in the astrocytes,
GFAP-alpha, was the most highly downregulated. Radomska et al. (2013)
identified a core QKI regulatory element (QRE) in the 3-prime UTR of the
GFAP-alpha transcript and a potential upstream half-site. The QRE, but
not the half-site, was conserved in mouse Gfap. Exposure of astrocytes
to the antipsychotic drug haloperidol specifically increased expression
of QKI7 and GFAP transcripts.

CYTOGENETICS

Backx et al. (2010) reported a woman with borderline mental retardation
and dysmorphic features who had a de novo reciprocal balanced
translocation t(5;6)(q23.1;q26) disrupting the QKI gene. The 5q
breakpoint occurred in a gene desert. RNA studies showed a 50% reduction
in QKI expression, consistent with haploinsufficiency. She presented at
birth with hypotonia, short neck, genital hypoplasia with underdeveloped
labia majora, and facial dysmorphism including epicanthal folds, narrow
palpebral fissures, broad nasal bridge with small nose and bulbous tip,
small mouth with downturned corners, a long philtrum, and small
protruding cupped ears. She attended special education schools.
Evaluation at age 23 years showed relative microcephaly,
microretrognathia, small mouth with high-arched palate, myopia, and
nasal speech. She also had inverted nipples and irregular menses.
Seizures and brain anomalies were not present.

Backx et al. (2010) provided a literature review of 18 patients reported
with chromosome 6qter deletions and 2 patients reported with
interstitial 6q deletion. All deletions included the QKI gene. They
noted that while the deletion sizes varied a common recognizable
phenotype of intellectual disabilities, hypotonia, seizures, brain
anomalies, and specific dysmorphic facial features could be distilled
for the chromosome 6qter deletion syndrome.

ANIMAL MODEL

Recessive mutations in the mouse quaking gene affect myelination and
embryogenesis and can be embryonic lethal. A spontaneous, recessive
quaking mutation, qk(v), results in viable mice with a severe deficit in
myelin, leading to rapid tremor by postnatal day 10. By Northern blot
analysis, Ebersole et al. (1996) detected a truncated Qki message in
brains of qk(v) mice.

Hardy et al. (1996) found that Qki-6 and Qki-7 were absent from
myelin-forming cells in qk(v) mice. Qki-5 was absent only from
oligodendrocytes of tracts from severely affected qk(v) brain regions.

Wu et al. (2002) found misregulated alternative splicing of several
myelin genes in qk(v) mice.

Lu et al. (2003) presented evidence that the qk(v) mutation affects an
enhancer required for expression of Qki in myelinating cells but not in
other tissues.

Chen and Richard (1998) determined that a point mutation within the QUA1
region of Qk1 caused embryonic lethality in mice. The mutation abolished
Qk1 self-association but had no effect on RNA-binding activity.
Expression of wildtype Qk1 or a lethal mutant Qk1 deficient in
self-association but not RNA binding induced cell death by apoptosis in
a mouse fibroblast cell line. The lethal Qk1 mutant was more potent at
inducing apoptosis.

Noveroske et al. (2002) found that embryonic mice with a lethal point
mutation in Qki had defective yolk sac vascular remodeling and abnormal
vessels in the embryo proper at midgestation, coinciding with embryonic
death.

Noveroske et al. (2005) isolated qk(e5), an N-ethyl-N-nitrosurea-induced
viable allele of mouse Qki. Unlike qk(v)/qk(v) mice, qk(e5)/qk(e5) mice
had early-onset seizures, severe ataxia, and a dramatically reduced life
span. Ultrastructural analysis of qk(e5)/qk(e5) brains revealed severe
dysmyelination when compared with both wildtype and qk(v)/qk(v) brains.
Young adult qk(e5)/qk(e5) mice exhibited Purkinje cell axonal swellings
indicative of neurodegeneration, which is not seen in young adult
qk(v)/qk(v) mice. The molecular defect in the qk(e5) allele was not
evident, but protein expression studies showed that qk(e5)/qk(e5)
postnatal oligodendrocytes lacked Qki-6 and Qki-7 and had reduced Qki-5
levels. Several oligodendrocyte developmental markers were present in
qk(e5)/qk(e5) postnatal brain, but Cnp (123830) and Mbp levels were
considerably reduced. Noveroske et al. (2005) noted that qk(v) is a
large deletion that affects expression of Pacrg (608427) and Parkin
(PARK2; 602544) in addition to Qki, complicating interpretation of its
neuropathology. Thus, they suggested that qk(e5) may be useful in
studying QKI regulation in the developing central nervous system and its
role in myelination.

Wilson et al. (2010) noted that the qk(v) phenotype, which includes
dysmyelination of the central nervous system and male sterility, is due
to reduced expression of Qk and a complete lack of Pacrg expression,
respectively. Since Pacrg is required for correct development of the
spermatozoan flagella (a specialized type of motile cilia), Wilson et
al. (2010) analyzed qk(v) mutant mice for evidence of cilial
dysfunction. Histologic and magnetic resonance imaging analyses
demonstrated that qk(v) mutant mice were affected by acquired,
communicating hydrocephalus (HC). Structure of axonemal microtubules and
density of ciliated cells were normal, and cilia length was similar to
wildtype littermates. There was a reduction in ependymal cilial beat
frequency and cilial-mediated flow in qk(v) mutant mice compared with
wildtype littermate controls. Transgenic expression of Pacrg was
necessary and sufficient to correct this deficit and rescue the HC
phenotype in the qk(v) mutant. Wilson et al. (2010) concluded that Pacrg
is required for motile cilia function and may be involved in the
pathogenesis of human ciliopathies, such as HC, asthenospermia, and
primary ciliary dyskinesia.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Nuclear hormone receptors activate gene transcription through
ligand-dependent association with coactivators. Specific LXXLL sequence
motifs present in these cofactors are sufficient to mediate these
ligand-induced interactions. Using the ligand-binding domain of the
retinoid X receptor as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen to identify
potential transcriptional coactivators of nuclear receptors, Lee et al.
(1999) isolated a cDNA encoding a nuclear protein-activating signal
cointegrator, which they designated ASC2. Sequence analysis of the
2,063-amino acid protein predicted an N-terminal acidic domain, 2
glutamine-rich domains, and a C-terminal serine/threonine-rich domain,
as well as 2 separate basic potential nuclear localization signal
domains and 2 copies of LXXLL motifs that function in ligand-dependent
interaction with the AF2 domain of nuclear receptors.

Caira et al. (2000) isolated a cDNA encoding a protein identical to
ASC2, which they termed nuclear receptor-activating protein 250 kD
(RAP250) and nuclear receptor coregulator (NRC), respectively. Northern
blot analysis by Caira et al. (2000) revealed widespread expression of
an approximately 7.5-kb transcript, with a 4.5-kb splice variant
detected in testis. Analysis of the testis sequence indicated that it
encodes a 1,070 amino acid protein that lacks residues 972-1964 of the
full-length sequence. ASC2 was also found to be widely expressed during
ontogeny in rat embryos.

Mahajan and Samuels (2000) characterized KIAA0181 (Nagase et al., 1996),
which they called NRC. NRC encodes a deduced 1,986-amino acid protein
with a calculated molecular mass of 210 kD. They also cloned a
C-terminal splice variant of rat Nrc that encodes a protein with only 1
LXXLL motif. The human and rat proteins share more than 85% amino acid
identity within the overlapping sequences. Northern blot analysis
detected several splice variants in multiple human tissues, with an 8-kb
transcript expressed in most tissues examined. Transcripts of 6.8, 4.5,
and 3.6 kb were expressed at various abundance. The 3.6-kb transcript
was the major species detected in skeletal muscle.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid system with the THRB (190160) ligand-binding
domain as bait, Ko et al. (2000) cloned a thyroid hormone
receptor-binding protein (TRBP) identical to ASC2. They found that TRBP
associates with thyroid hormone receptor through an LXXLL motif and that
it is ubiquitously expressed as a 9-kb mRNA transcript.

Zhu et al. (2000) cloned and analyzed the mouse homolog of RAP250, Prip.

GENE FUNCTION

Analyzing tissue microarrays by FISH, Lee et al. (1999) found increased
ASC2 copy number in 10% of breast cancer specimens and in all breast
cancer cell lines tested. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that amino acids
586-860 of ASC2, which do not include the LXXLL motifs, are the minimum
interaction domain with the AF2 domain of numerous nuclear receptors.
N-terminal subregions of ASC2, either alone or in conjunction with CBP
(600140) and SRC1 (NCOA1; 602691), stimulated ligand-dependent
transactivation by wildtype nuclear receptors. Microinjection of
anti-ASC2 into cells demonstrated abrogation of the transactivation
function.

Using GST pull-down assays, Caira et al. (2000) determined that the
first LXXLL motif of ASC2 (LVNLL, contained in residues 819-1096) but
not the second (LSQLL, residues 1491-1495) interacted strongly with
nuclear receptors.

Mahajan and Samuels (2000) found that only the first LXXLL domain of NRC
is functional and that mutation of this sequence abolished
transcriptional enhancement. By deletion mapping, they determined that
NRC contains a potent N-terminal activation domain, a second activation
domain that overlaps with the receptor-interacting LXXLL region, and a
C-terminal inhibitory domain that influences the overall transcriptional
activity of the protein. They also found evidence that NRC binds to
liganded receptors as a dimer and that this association leads to
structural changes in NRC, resulting in activation.

Ko et al. (2000) showed that TRBP strongly transactivates through THRB
and estrogen receptor in a dose-related and ligand-dependent manner.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a human ovary cDNA library, Antonson et
al. (2008) showed that RAP250 interacted with SMAD2 (601366) and SMAD3
(603109), intracellular mediators of TGF-beta (TGFB1; 190180) signaling.
Expression of truncated proteins in a human hepatoma cell line showed
that the C-terminal Mad homology-2 (MH2) domain of SMAD2 interacted with
the second LxxLL motif of RAP250. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking
Rap250 had reduced expression of Tgf-beta target genes following
Tgf-beta stimulation compared with wildtype cells. Antonson et al.
(2008) also demonstrated crosstalk between the TGF-beta and liver X
receptor (see 602423) signaling pathways that appeared to be mediated by
Rap250.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhu et al. (2000) determined that the mouse Prip gene contains 13 exons
and spans about 47.5 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1996) mapped the TRBP gene,
which they called KIAA0181, to chromosome 20. Lee et al. (1999) stated
that ASC2 is identical to AIB3, which Guan et al. (1996) mapped to
chromosome 20q11, a region of genomic instability in breast cancer, by
FISH.

ANIMAL MODEL

By homologous recombination, Kuang et al. (2002) deleted Ncoa6 in mice.
Heterozygous mice were developmentally normal and fertile, but
homozygous embryos showed growth restriction and lethality 9.75 to 11.5
days postconception. Lethality was associated with defects in the
development of the placenta vascular network and cardiac hypoplasia. The
defects were similar to those found in mice lacking Ppar-gamma (601487)
or Ppar-gamma-binding protein (604311).

Antonson et al. (2003) also found obstructed placental blood circulation
following disruption of Ncoa6 in mice. The transcriptional activity of
Pparg was reduced in fibroblasts derived from Ncoa6-null embryos,
suggesting that Ncoa6 is an essential coactivator for Pparg in the
placenta.

Zhu et al. (2003) found that Prip deletion in mice resulted in embryonic
lethality between 11.5 and 12.5 days postcoitum, due mostly to growth
retardation and defects in development of placenta, heart, liver, and
nervous system. Fibroblasts from Prip -/- embryos showed decreased
capacity for ligand-dependent transcriptional activation of Rxra
(180245) and, to a lesser extent, Rar-alpha (RARA; 180240) and Pparg.

Qi et al. (2003) found that Prip-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts failed
to exhibit Pparg-stimulated adipogenesis. Furthermore, they did not
express fatty acid-binding protein-4 (FABP4; 600434), a Pparg-responsive
gene and adipogenic marker. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays
revealed the presence of endogenous Pparg on the Fabp4 promoter in
Prip-null cells, but recruitment of Pimt (606461) to the promoter in
response to exogenous Pparg was less robust compared with wildtype
cells. Binding of Pimt to Cbp (CREBBP; 600140)/p300 (EP300; 602700) was
weaker in Prip-null cells compared with wildtype cells. Qi et al. (2003)
concluded that PRIP is an essential downstream activator of
PPARG-mediated adipogenesis.

Mahajan et al. (2004) found that the effects of Nrc insufficiency on
growth, fertility, and neonatal and postnatal mortality depended on
genetic background in 2 strains of Nrc +/- mice. However, both strains
showed a defect in wound healing.

Qi et al. (2004) found that targeted deletion of Prip in mouse mammary
gland resulted in impaired ductal branching, decreased alveolar density,
and impaired estrogen response. The differentiated function of
Prip-deficient mammary epithelial cells was largely intact.

Kim et al. (2002) created transgenic mice carrying a dominant-negative
fragment of Asc2 that included the N-terminal LXXLL motif. This fragment
inhibited Asc2 recruitment to nuclear receptors, and expression of this
fragment in mice resulted in a plethora of developmental and phenotypic
abnormalities, including problems with eye, heart, motor activities, and
fat metabolism in liver. In particular, the ocular anomaly provided a
basis for posterior lenticonus with cataract.

614639	TITLE *614639 ZINC FINGER- AND BTB DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 46; ZBTB46
;;BTB-ZINC FINGER PROTEIN EXPRESSED IN EFFECTOR LYMPHOCYTES; BZEL
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Shin et al. (2012) cloned mouse Zbtb46, which they called Bzel. The
deduced protein contains an N-terminal BTB domain and 2 C-terminal
Kruppel-like C2H2 zinc finger domains.

GENE FUNCTION

Shin et al. (2012) reported that mouse Bzel bound the promoter region of
Blimp1 (PRDM1; 603423) and suppressed its transcription. They found that
Bzel was modified by sumoylation. Desi1 (614637) removed Sumo1 (601912)
from Bzel and reduced its repressive activity against Blimp1.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the ZBTB46 gene to chromosome 20q13.33 based on an
alignment of the ZBTB46 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK023564) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

606303	TITLE *606303 PROTOCADHERIN-GAMMA, SUBFAMILY B, MEMBER 6; PCDHGB6
;;PCDH-GAMMA-B6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cadherins are calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecules, and
protocadherins constitute a subfamily of nonclassic cadherins. PCDHGB6
is 1 of 22 tandemly arranged genes within the PCDHG gene cluster
(604968) on chromosome 5q31. The 22 PCDHG genes function as 'variable'
exons that are individually spliced to a downstream constant region to
form distinct PCDHG transcripts. The variable PCDHG exons encode the
extracellular and transmembrane domains of the protocadherin protein,
and the common region encodes the intracellular domain (Wu et al.,
2001). For further information on the PCDHG genes, see 604968.

CLONING

By PCR of a brain cDNA library, Wu and Maniatis (1999) cloned
full-length PCDHGB6.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Wu et al. (2001) mapped the PCDHGB6 gene
to chromosome 5q31, between the PCDHGA9 gene (606296) and the PCDHGA10
gene (606297). They localized the mouse PCDHG genes to chromosome 18c.

109091	TITLE *109091 CALRETICULIN; CALR
;;CRT;;
AUTOANTIGEN Ro; RO;;
COMPLEMENT COMPONENT C1q RECEPTOR; CC1QR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Calreticulin is a multifunctional protein that acts as a major
Ca(2+)-binding (storage) protein in the lumen of the endoplasmic
reticulum. It is also found in the nucleus, suggesting that it may have
a role in transcription regulation (Burns et al., 1994).

CLONING

Calreticulin binds to the synthetic peptide KLGFFKR, which is almost
identical to an amino acid sequence in the DNA-binding domain of the
superfamily of nuclear receptors. McCauliffe et al. (1990) showed that
calreticulin binds to antibodies in certain sera of systemic lupus and
Sjogren patients which contain anti-Ro/SSA antibodies, that it is highly
conserved among species, and that it is located in the endoplasmic and
sarcoplasmic reticulum where it may bind calcium. With synthetic
oligonucleotides corresponding to the amino acid sequence, McCauliffe et
al. (1990) isolated full-length CALR cDNA that encodes a human Ro
ribonucleoprotein autoantigen. The deduced 417-amino acid protein has a
predicted molecular mass of 48 kD. Southern filter hybridization
analysis showed that the CALR gene is not highly polymorphic and exists
in single copy in the human genome.

Frank (1994) pointed out that the CALR gene mapped to chromosome 19p
encodes the 48-kD calreticulin, a protein with Ro/SSA properties. Itoh
et al. (1991) showed that the 52-kD and the 60-kD forms of Ro/SSA
ribonucleoproteins are encoded by separate genes mapping to chromosome
11 (TRIM21; 109092) and chromosome 1 (TROVE2; 600063), respectively.

By Northern blot analysis of human tissues, Persson et al. (2002) found
ubiquitous expression of a 1.9-kb CALR transcript.

GENE FUNCTION

Burns et al. (1994) reported that the amino terminus of calreticulin
interacts with the DNA-binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor and
prevents the receptor from binding to its specific glucocorticoid
response element. Dedhar et al. (1994) showed that calreticulin can
inhibit the binding of androgen receptor to its hormone-responsive DNA
element and can inhibit androgen receptor and retinoic acid receptor
transcriptional activities in vivo, as well as retinoic acid-induced
neuronal differentiation. Thus, calreticulin can act as an important
modulator of the regulation of gene transcription by nuclear hormone
receptors.

Boehm et al. (1994) showed that SLE is associated with increased
autoantibody titers against calreticulin but that calreticulin is not a
Ro/SS-A antigen. Orth et al. (1996) found increased autoantibody titers
against human calreticulin in infants with complete congenital heart
block (234700) of both the IgG and IgM classes.

THBS1 (188060) or a peptide of the 19-amino acid active site in its
heparin-binding domain signals focal adhesion disassembly through
interaction with a cell surface form of CRT. Using bovine aortic
endothelial cells and wildtype and low density lipoprotein
receptor-related protein (LRP, or LRP1; 107770) -/- mouse fibroblasts,
Orr et al. (2003) showed that Lrp interacted with Crt and was required
to mediate focal adhesion disassembly and downstream signaling for
reorganization of focal adhesions. Binding of the LRP ligand RAP
(LRPAP1; 104225) to purified human LRP inhibited interaction between
recombinant human CRT and LRP.

Gardai et al. (2005) stated that calreticulin on the surface of
apoptotic cells serves as a recognition and clearance ligand by
activating the internalization receptor LRP1 (107770) on the responding
phagocyte cell surface. Using mouse and human cells, they found that the
surface expression of calreticulin increased and calreticulin was
redistributed during apoptosis, possibly enhancing stimulation of LRP1
on the phagocyte. In addition, CD47 (601028) on the apoptotic cell
surface was altered and/or lost, which reduced the activation of
SIRP-alpha (PTPNS1; 602461) on the phagocytic cell surface, resulting in
phagocytosis.

In CT26 mouse colon cancer cells, Obeid et al. (2007) demonstrated that
anthracyclins induced immunogenic cell death by way of a rapid,
preapoptotic translocation of calreticulin to the cell surface. Blockade
or knockdown of Calr suppressed phagocytosis of anthracyclin-treated
tumor cells by dendritic cells and abolished their immunogenicity in
mice. Anthracyclin-induced Calr translocation was mimicked by inhibition
of the protein phosphatase-1 (see PPP1CA; 176875)/Gadd34 (PPP1R15A;
611048) complex. Administration of recombinant Calr or inhibitors of
Pp1/Gadd34 restored immunogenicity of cell death elicited by etoposide
and mitomycin C and enhanced their antitumor effects in vivo. Obeid et
al. (2007) concluded that CALR plays a key role in determining
anticancer immune responses.

Using flow cytometric and confocal microscopy analyses, Zeng et al.
(2006) demonstrated that NYESO1 (CTAG1B; 300156) bound to immature
dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, and monocytes, but not to T cells or
B cells. Immunoprecipitation and tandem mass spectrometric analyses
showed that CALR was the only DC surface-specific protein that
interacted with NYESO1. Anti-CALR inhibited NYESO1 binding on immature
DCs and its cross-presentation to CD8 (see 186910)-positive T cells.
Surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that NYESO1 bound to CALR, but
not to other molecular chaperones. Zeng et al. (2006) proposed that
NYESO1 binding to CALR on macrophages and DCs provides a link between
NYESO1, the innate immune system, and possibly the adaptive immune
response against NYESO1.

GENE STRUCTURE

Persson et al. (2002) stated that the CALR gene contains 9 exons and
spans 4.2 kb.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids, McCauliffe et al. (1990) assigned
the CALR gene to chromosome 19p. There was perfect concordance with LDLR
(606945) but discordance with C3 (120700). Thus, the calreticulin, or
RO, locus may be located in the region of chromosome 19pter-p13.2,
distal to C3 and near LDLR.

Rooke et al. (1997) mapped the mouse Calr gene to chromosome 8.

138079	TITLE *138079 GLUCOKINASE; GCK
;;GK; GLK;;
HEXOKINASE 4; HK4;;
LIVER GLUCOKINASE; LGLK
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The phosphorylation of glucose at the sixth carbon position is the first
step in glycolysis. The reaction is catalyzed by a family of enzymes
called hexokinases, types I (142600) through IV (glucokinase).
Glucokinase (GCK; EC 2.7.1.1) is a structurally and functionally unique
member of this family. Glucokinase is expressed only in mammalian liver
and pancreatic islet beta cells. Because of its unique functional
characteristics, the enzyme plays an important regulatory role in
glucose metabolism. The rate of glucose metabolism in liver and pancreas
is a function of the activity of the enzyme (summary by Matsutani et
al., 1992).

CLONING

Using rat islet glucokinase cDNA to screen a human islet cDNA library,
followed by screening a human liver cDNA library and RT-PCR of liver
RNA, Tanizawa et al. (1991) cloned 2 GCK splice variants, which they
called LGLK1 and LGLK2. LGLK1 encodes a deduced 464-amino acid protein
with a calculated molecular mass of 52 kD. LGLK2 encodes a deduced
466-amino acid protein with 16 different N-terminal amino acids compared
with LGLK1. LGLK2 shares 98% identity with rat islet glucokinase.
Northern blot analysis detected a 2.8-kb transcript in liver total RNA.
In vitro translation of LGLK1 cDNA resulted in proteins with apparent
molecular masses of 52 and 48 kD by SDS-PAGE. Proteins of similar masses
were translated from LGLK2.

GENE STRUCTURE

Stoffel et al. (1992) determined that the GCK gene contains 12 exons.
Alternative promoters and alternative splicing encode different-sized
proteins.

MAPPING

Matsutani et al. (1992) identified a region of compound dinucleotide
repeats located approximately 10 kb 3-prime to the GCK gene and used
oligonucleotide primers and PCR amplification to demonstrate a number of
alleles created by this repeat region. The variable numbers of CT and CA
repeats represented altogether 6 alleles that range in length from +10
to -15 nucleotides compared to the most common (Z) allele. Two alleles,
Z+10 and Z-15, appeared to be unique to American blacks, while a Z+6
allele was observed only in the Caucasian population studied. Using the
PCR assay, they localized the human glucokinase gene to chromosome 7 in
a panel of rodent/human somatic cell lines. Genetic analysis in CEPH
pedigrees placed the dinucleotide repeat element, and thereby GCK, on 7p
between TCRG (see 186970) and the RFLP locus D7S57.

Mishra et al. (1992) placed GCK between D7S57 proximally and D7S65
distally. It was estimated to lie about 4.7 cM from D7S65; D7S65 was
found to be about 3.4 cM from TCRG, which is located at 7p15-p14.
(Mishra et al. (1992) gave the location of TCRG as 7p15 in their Figure
2.)

GENE FUNCTION

Byrne et al. (1994) studied pancreatic beta-cell function in 4 males and
2 females from kindreds with known GCK mutations and in 6 controls
pair-matched for age, weight, and sex. All of the GCK subjects with GCK
mutations were found to have elevated fasting and postprandial glucose
levels in comparison to the 6 controls. Insulin secretion rates (ISRs)
were estimated. The results supported a key role for GCK in determining
the in vivo glucose/ISR dose-response relationships and defined the
alterations in beta-cell responsiveness that occur in subjects with GCK
mutations.

Heimberg et al. (1996) reported the expression of glucokinase in rat
glucagon-producing islet alpha cells, which are negatively regulated by
glucose. Purified rat alpha cells expressed glucokinase mRNA and protein
with the same transcript length, nucleotide sequence, and
immunoreactivity as the beta-cell isoform. Glucokinase activity
accounted for more than 50% of glucose phosphorylation in extracts of
alpha cells and for more than 90% of glucose utilization in intact
cells. A glucagon-producing tumor also contained glucokinase mRNA,
protein, and enzymatic activity. The data indicated that glucokinase may
serve as a metabolic glucose sensor in pancreatic alpha cells and,
hence, mediate a mechanism for direct regulation of glucagon release by
extracellular glucose. Since the alpha cells do not express GLUT2
(138160), Heimberg et al. (1996) suggested that glucose sensing does not
necessarily require the coexpression of GLUT2 and glucokinase.

On the basis of studies in 7 glucokinase-deficient subjects with normal
glycosylated hemoglobin and 12 control subjects using (13)C nuclear
magnetic spectroscopy during a day in which 3 isocaloric mixed meals
were ingested, Velho et al. (1996) observed results suggesting that in
addition to the altered beta-cell function, abnormalities in liver
glycogen metabolism play an important role in the pathogenesis of
hypoglycemia in patients with maturity-onset diabetes of the young type
II (MODY2; 125851). Average fasting hepatic glycogen content was similar
in both groups and increased in both after the meals with a continuous
pattern throughout the day. However, the net increment in hepatic
glycogen content after each meal was 30 to 60% lower in
glucokinase-deficient than in control subjects. Glucokinase-deficient
subjects had decreased net accumulation of hepatic glycogen and
relatively augmented hepatic gluconeogenesis after meals.

Danial et al. (2003) undertook a proteomic analysis to assess whether
BAD (603167) might participate in mitochondrial physiology. In liver
mitochondria, BAD resides in a functional holoenzyme complex together
with protein kinase A (see 176911) and protein phosphatase-1 (PP1; see
176875) catalytic units, WAVE1 (605035) as an A kinase-anchoring
protein, and glucokinase. Using mitochondria from hepatocytes of
Bad-deficient mice, Danial et al. (2003) demonstrated that BAD is
required to assemble the complex, the lack of which results in
diminished mitochondria-based glucokinase activity and blunted
mitochondrial respiration in response to glucose. Glucose deprivation
results in dephosphorylation of BAD, and BAD-dependent cell death.
Moreover, Danial et al. (2003) demonstrated that the phosphorylation
status of BAD helps regulate glucokinase activity. Mice deficient in BAD
or bearing a nonphosphorylatable BAD (3SA) mutant (Datta et al., 2002)
display abnormal glucose homeostasis, including profound defects in
glucose tolerance. Danial et al. (2003) concluded that this combination
of proteomics, genetics, and physiology indicates an unanticipated role
for BAD in integrating pathways of glucose metabolism and apoptosis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young

In 16 French families with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY2;
125851), Froguel et al. (1992) found linkage of the disease with GCK.
There was statistically significant evidence of genetic heterogeneity,
with an estimated 45 to 95% of the 16 families showing linkage to
glucokinase. Because glucokinase is a key enzyme of blood glucose
homeostasis, the results suggested a pathogenetic connection. The
relationship was clinched by the demonstration by Vionnet et al. (1992)
of a nonsense mutation in the GCK gene (138079.0001).

Velho et al. (1992) studied pancreatic beta-cell secretory function in 9
patients from 4 GCK-linked MODY kindreds. They found that beta-cell
secretory response to continuous glucose stimulus during a hyperglycemic
glucose clamp was significantly reduced. This finding was different from
that for noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus with late age of onset
or MODY not linked to GCK. Fasting plasma insulin and C-peptide levels
in patients were inappropriately low in relation to concomitant plasma
glucose level. Furthermore, during a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp,
endogenous insulin secretion at euglycemia was suppressed in patients
but not in controls. Velho et al. (1992) interpreted these results as
suggesting that mutant GCK leads to chronic hyperglycemia by raising the
threshold of circulating glucose levels which induces insulin secretion.
This was the first demonstration of a primary pancreatic secretory
defect associated with a form of NIDDM.

Froguel et al. (1993) detected 16 mutations of the GCK gene in 18 of 32
families with MODY. An explanation for the way a mutation in glucokinase
might cause diabetes follows from the work of Matschinsky (1990), who
developed the concept that glucokinase acts as the glucose sensor of
beta cells. According to this concept, the rates of glucose metabolism
and insulin secretion are closely linked, with both being determined by
the plasma glucose concentration. In beta cells and hepatocytes, the
rate of glucose metabolism is determined by the rate of glucose
phosphorylation, which is catalyzed by glucokinase. Beta cells and
hepatocytes also contain glucose transporter-2 (GLUT2; 138160), an
insulin-independent cellular protein that mediates the transport of
glucose into cells. The capacity of GLUT2 to transport glucose is very
high, facilitating rapid equilibrium between extracellular and
intracellular glucose. Thus, in effect, the extracellular glucose
concentrations are sensed by glucokinase.

Randle (1993) provided a review of glucokinase and candidate genes for
type II MODY. Matschinsky et al. (1993) also reviewed glucokinase as the
pancreatic beta-cell glucose sensor and 'diabetes gene.' They tabulated
16 separate mutations in the GCK gene found in families with MODY.

Johansen et al. (2005) examined the prevalence and nature of mutations
in the 3 common MODY genes HNF4A (600281), GCK, and TCF1 (142410) in
Danish patients with a clinical diagnosis of MODY and determined
metabolic differences in probands with and without mutations in HNF4A,
GCK, and TCF1. They identified 29 different mutations in 38 MODY
families. Fifteen of the mutations were novel. The variants segregated
with diabetes within the families, and none of the variants were found
in 100 normal Danish chromosomes. Their findings suggested a relative
prevalence of 3% of MODY1 (125850) (2 different mutations in 2
families), 10% of MODY2 (7 in 8), and 36% of MODY3 (600496) (21 in 28)
among Danish kindred clinically diagnosed as MODY. No significant
differences in biochemical and anthropometric measurements were observed
at baseline examinations. Forty-nine percent of the families carried
mutations in the 3 examined MODY genes.

Vits et al. (2006) identified 19 different GCK mutations, including 11
novel mutations (see, e.g., 138079.0014), in 33 (26.6%) of 124 Belgian
probands with MODY.

Pinterova et al. (2007) screened the GCK gene in 92 Czech probands
fulfilling classic MODY criteria and identified 15 different missense
mutations in 27 (29%) patients; the mutations were not found in 50
unrelated healthy Czech individuals. Pinterova et al. (2007) concluded
that mutations in GCK are a common cause of MODY in the Czech
population.

In a mainland Chinese family with a clinical profile similar to that of
previously reported MODY2 families, Shen et al. (2011) analyzed the GCK
gene and identified a heterozygous missense mutation (E339K;
138079.0016) that segregated with the disease and was not found in 200
controls. Functional analysis indicated that the mutation inactivated
enzyme kinetics and severely impaired GCK protein stability.

- Gestational Diabetes

The variable phenotype observed with mutations in the GCK gene includes
gestational diabetes mellitus (see 125851). This fact prompted Stoffel
et al. (1993) to screen a group of women with gestational diabetes who
also had a first-degree relative with diabetes mellitus for the presence
of GCK mutations. Among 40 subjects, they identified 2 mutations
(138079.0007-138070.0008), suggesting a prevalence of approximately 5%.
Extrapolating from this result, the prevalence of glucokinase-deficient
NIDDM among Americans may be approximately 1 in 2,500.

Fetal insulin secretion in response to maternal glycemia plays a key
role in fetal growth, and adult insulin secretion is a primary
determinant of glucose tolerance. Hattersley et al. (1998) hypothesized
that a defect in the sensing of glucose by the pancreas, caused by a
heterozygous mutation in the glucokinase gene, could reduce fetal growth
and birth weight in addition to causing hyperglycemia after birth. In 58
offspring, where one parent had a glucokinase mutation, the inheritance
of a glucokinase mutation by the fetus resulted in a mean reduction of
birth weight of 533 g (P = 0.002). In 19 of 21 sib pairs discordant for
the presence of a glucokinase mutation, the child with the mutation had
a lower birth weight, with a mean difference of 521 g (P = 0.0002).
Maternal hyperglycemia due to a glucokinase mutation resulted in a mean
increase in birth weight of 601 g (P = 0.001). The effects of maternal
and fetal glucokinase mutations on birth weight were additive.
Hattersley et al. (1998) proposed that these changes in birth weight
reflect changes in fetal insulin secretion which are influenced directly
by the fetal genotype and indirectly, through maternal hyperglycemia, by
the maternal genotype.

Dunger et al. (1998) demonstrated an association between the insulin
VNTR (variable number tandem repeat) 'locus,' and specifically the VNTR
III genotype, and larger size at birth. McCarthy (1998) discussed the
significance of these observations in relation to the 'thrifty genotype'
hypothesis originally proposed by Neel (1962) and updated by Neel et al.
(1998).

- Permanent Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus

Rowe et al. (1995) evaluated 35 microsatellite marker loci on human
chromosome 7 for linkage to insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM)
in 339 affected sib-pair families. Increased sharing of parental
haplotypes in affected sib pairs was detected for 2 microsatellite
markers flanking GCK. Preferential transmission of alleles to affected
offspring was observed at one of these marker loci, GCK3, indicating
linkage disequilibrium between the marker and the disease susceptibility
locus. This combination of linkage and disease association suggested to
Rowe et al. (1995) that glucokinase, or a gene in the vicinity, plays an
important role in IDDM susceptibility. (Rowe et al. (1995) used the
designations GCK1, GCK2, and GCK3 for 3 modestly polymorphic
microsatellite markers near the GCK gene (Concannon, 1995). These are
not symbols for separate glucokinase genes; there is only a single GCK
gene on 7p, although as a result of alternative, tissue-specific
promoters, there are islet- and liver-specific forms that differ in
their amino-terminal sequences.)

Njolstad et al. (2001) described 2 patients in whom complete deficiency
of glucokinase caused permanent neonatal-onset diabetes (606176). One
patient was homozygous for an M210K mutation (138079.0010); the other
was homozygous for a T228M mutation (138079.0011). Both patients showed
total absence of basal insulin release.

- Hyperinsulinemic Hypoglycemia

In 'family 3' studied by Thornton et al. (1998), in which affected
members had hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (see HHF3, 602485), Glaser et
al. (1998) identified heterozygosity for an activating mutation
(138079.0009) in the GCK gene.

In a 14-year-old obese boy with a history of neonatal hypoglycemia
treated with diazoxide, who was experiencing hypoglycemic episodes
associated with seizures and unconsciousness, Christesen et al. (2002)
identified heterozygosity for an activating mutation in the GCK gene
(138079.0012). The boy's normal-weight mother, who had asymptomatic
fasting hypoglycemia, carried the same mutation. Christesen et al.
(2002) noted the striking contrast in clinical presentation between the
mother and son with the same mutation, and recalled a similar situation
in the family reported by Glaser et al. (1998), in which the proband was
obese and severely hyperinsulinemic, whereas his sister who carried the
same mutation was of normal weight, had relatively low insulin levels,
and milder clinical symptoms.

In a Finnish woman with severe hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia from birth,
who had severe mental retardation and died at age 29 still having
hypoglycemic seizures, Cuesta-Munoz et al. (2004) identified
heterozygosity for a de novo activating mutation in the GCK gene
(138079.0013).

Kassem et al. (2010) reported a young girl with severe neonatal
hypoglycemia due to a missense mutation in the GCK gene (138079.0015) in
whom mean islet cell areas in both the head and the tail of the pancreas
were significantly larger than those of 5 age-matched controls and those
of 2 age-matched patients with diffuse hypoglycemia due to ABCC8
mutations (600509; see HHF1, 256450). Noting a previously reported HHF3
patient in whom quantitative histologic analysis of pancreatic specimens
showed a similar increase in the mean islet profile (Cuesta-Munoz et al.
(2004)), Kassem et al. (2010) suggested that histologic findings in
infants with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia might differ according to the
genetic cause of the condition.

- Other Associations

Stone et al. (1996) used SSCP analysis to determine whether a G-to-A
variant at position -30 of the beta-cell promoter of the GCK gene is
associated with impaired beta-cell function. The variant was observed
more frequently in Japanese-American men with impaired glucose tolerance
than in Japanese-American men with normal glucose tolerance. Beta-cell
function was assessed using the ratio of the incremental response in
immunoreactive insulin to that of glucose during the first 30 minutes of
the oral glucose tolerance test. They concluded that the -30 promoter
variant is associated with reduced beta-cell function in middle-aged
Japanese-American men and may contribute to the high risk of abnormal
glucose tolerance in this population. They noted that the polymorphism
has been observed in other populations.

Marz et al. (2004) analyzed the GCK -30G-A variant in 2,567 patients
with and in 731 individuals without coronary artery disease (CAD; see
CHDS1, 607339) by angiography and found that the A allele of the
pancreatic GCK promoter increased the risk of CAD in individuals both
with and without type II diabetes mellitus (ORs, 1.92 and 1.27,
respectively). The A allele was also associated with an increased
prevalence of type II diabetes mellitus, particularly among CAD
patients.

For discussion of an association between variation in the GCK gene and
fasting plasma glucose levels, see FGQTL2 (613219).

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Gloyn (2003) stated that given the central role of glucokinase in the
regulation of insulin release, it is understandable that mutations in
the GCK gene can cause both hyper- and hypoglycemia. Heterozygous
inactivating mutations in GCK cause MODY, characterized by mild
hyperglycemia, which is present at birth, but is often only detected
later in life. Homozygous inactivating GCK mutations result in a more
severe phenotype, presenting at birth as permanent neonatal diabetes
mellitus. Several heterozygous activating GCK mutations causing
hypoglycemia had been reported as instances of familial hyperinsulinism
(see HHF3, 602485). Gloyn (2003) tabulated 195 mutations in the GCK
gene, found in 285 families. There were no common mutations and the
mutations were distributed throughout the gene. Mutations causing
hypoglycemia are located in various exons in a discrete region of the
protein termed the heterotropic allosteric activator site. Patients with
MODY type 2 (due to GCK mutations) rarely need pharmacologic treatment
and most are managed on diet alone. During pregnancy, some women with
GCK mutations are treated with insulin, which, due to its role in fetal
growth, can result in babies that are large for gestational age if they
do not also have the GCK mutation (Hattersley et al., 1998).
Microvascular complications are rare in MODY2. These patients do not
need to be followed in a diabetes clinic, but should have an HbA1c
checked annually. Some patients with hyperinsulinism due to GCK
mutations may not require pharmacologic intervention and may be able to
control their symptoms by eating regularly. Patients with
hyperinsulinism due to mutation in the ABCC8 gene (600509) or the KCNJ11
gene (600937) respond poorly or are totally refractory to the potassium
channel opener diazoxide, which is used to inhibit insulin secretion.
Conversely, patients with hyperinsulinism resulting from GCK mutations
respond well or tolerated diazoxide (Gloyn et al., 2003).

ANIMAL MODEL

Using homologous recombination in mouse embryonic stem cells to disrupt
the glucokinase gene, Bali et al. (1995) showed that heterozygous mice
showed a phenotype similar to MODY. Reduced islet glucokinase activity
caused mildly elevated fasting blood glucose levels. Hyperglycemic clamp
studies revealed decreased glucose tolerance and abnormal liver glucose
metabolism. These findings demonstrated a key role for glucokinase in
glucose homeostasis and implicated both islets and liver in the MODY
disease. Aizawa et al. (1996) made a detailed study of pancreatic
beta-cell function in the isolated pancreatic islets of heterozygous GCK
knockout mice. The beta cells of these mice displayed impaired glucose
sensitivity, poor discrimination of alpha- and beta-glucose anomers, and
normal activity of the ATP-sensitive K+ channel. The mice displayed
impaired insulin release after insulin treatment and age-related
worsening of glucose tolerance.

Understanding how the beta cells of the pancreatic islet sense an
alteration in glucose levels is critical to understanding how glucose
homeostasis is maintained. Grupe et al. (1995) noted that glucose
sensing is mediated through an increase in the rate of intracellular
catabolism of glucose rather than a ligand-receptor interaction.
However, it is likely that there is still a need for a rate-limiting
step in glucose catabolism to serve the role of glucose sensor. A
compelling case can be made for glucokinase fulfilling this role, since
phosphorylation by GLK appears to be the rate-limiting step for glucose
catabolism in beta cells. To test this possibility and to resolve the
relative roles of liver and beta-cell GLK in maintaining glucose levels,
Grupe et al. (1995) generated mice completely deficient in GLK and
transgenic mice in which GLK is expressed only in beta cells. In mice
with only 1 GLK allele, blood glucose levels were elevated and insulin
secretion was reduced. GLK-deficient mice died perinatally with severe
hyperglycemia. Expression of GLK in beta cells in the absence of
expression in the liver is sufficient for survival.

Grimsby et al. (2003) identified a class of antidiabetic agents that act
as nonessential, mixed-type glucokinase activators that increase the
glucose affinity and maximum velocity of glucokinase. Glucokinase
activators augmented both hepatic glucose metabolism and glucose-induced
insulin secretion from isolated rodent pancreatic islets, consistent
with the expression and function of glucokinase in both cell types. In
several rodent models of NIDDM, glucokinase activators lowered blood
glucose levels, improved the results of glucose tolerance tests, and
increased hepatic glucose uptake.

Using N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis, Inoue et al. (2004)
generated diabetic mice. The authors screened 9,375 animals and
identified 11 mutations in the glucokinase (Gk) gene that were
associated with hyperglycemia. Four had been found previously in human
MODY2 (125851) patients, and 1 was found previously in a patient with
permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM; 606176). Some of the Gk
mutant lines displayed impaired glucose-responsive insulin secretion,
and the mutations had different effects on Gk mRNA levels and/or the
stability of the GK protein.

Terauchi et al. (2007) generated mice with haploinsufficiency of beta
cell-specific Gck and observed that on a high-fat diet, Gck +/- mice had
decreased beta cell replication and insufficient beta cell hyperplasia
compared to wildtype mice despite a similar degree of insulin
resistance. On a high-fat diet, Gck +/- mouse islets showed decreased
insulin receptor substrate-2 (Irs2; 600797) expression compared with
wildtype islets. Overexpression of Irs2 in beta cells of Gck +/- mice
partially prevented diabetes by increasing beta cell mass. Terauchi et
al. (2007) suggested that both GCK and IRS2 are critical for beta cell
hyperplasia to occur in response to high-fat diet-induced insulin
resistance.

GCK, GLU279TER

In the process of single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP)
analysis of exon 7 in a French family with GCK-linked MODY (125851),
previously studied by Froguel et al. (1992), Vionnet et al. (1992)
demonstrated a G-to-T substitution in codon 279 which changed GAG
(glutamic acid) to TAG, an amber termination codon. An individual in
this family who had noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) did
not show linkage to GCK; moreover, she did not have the nonsense
mutation in codon 279. Thus, there were 2 forms of NIDDM in this
kindred. Hattersley et al. (1992) likewise found tight linkage of MODY
to a macrosatellite polymorphism associated with the GCK locus; peak lod
= 4.60 at theta = 0.0. In a second MODY pedigree, they excluded linkage;
lod = -7.36 at theta = 0.0.

.0002
DIABETES MELLITUS, NONINSULIN-DEPENDENT, LATE-ONSET
GCK, ARG186TER

In a Japanese family, Katagiri et al. (1992) found a correlation between
the presence of late-onset noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
(125853) or impaired glucose tolerance and a nonsense mutation in exon 5
of the glucokinase gene: a C-to-T transition changing codon 186 from CGA
(arginine) to TGA (an amber termination codon). The mutation was
predicted to delete 60% of the amino acid residues of the glucokinase
derived from the affected allele. The family was detected through a
59-year-old woman who was the twenty-third subject screened. Froguel and
Velho (1993) raised the question as to whether the Japanese family may
in fact have had MODY, because in their experience in French families
carrying mutations in GCK, hyperglycemia often went undiagnosed for a
long time. Chiu et al. (1993) likewise questioned whether the disorder
in the Japanese families should be termed NIDDM and pointed out that in
young patients with glucokinase mutations the degree of hyperglycemia is
so mild that values often do not exceed the renal threshold. Therefore,
absence of glycosuria cannot be used as a criterion for distinguishing
MODY from NIDDM. Using their criteria of NIDDM, (Permutt et al., 1992)
pointed out that structural mutations in the GCK gene are very rare
(less than 2%) in American black and Caucasian NIDDM patients.

.0003
MATURITY-ONSET DIABETES OF THE YOUNG, TYPE II
GCK, THR228MET

Stoffel et al. (1992) stated that DNA polymorphisms in the glucokinase
gene has been shown to be tightly linked to MODY (125851) in
approximately 80% of French families. They identified 2 further missense
mutations in exon 7 in families with MODY: thr228 to met and gly261 to
arg (138079.0004). A TGC-to-TAC change at codon 228 and a CCC-to-TCC
change at codon 261 were responsible. Using computer-assisted modeling
and the crystal structure of the related yeast hexokinase B as a simple
model for human beta-cell glucokinase, Stoffel et al. (1992) obtained
data which suggested to them that mutation of thr228 affects affinity
for ATP and mutation of gly261 alters glucose binding. The
identification of mutations in glucokinase, a protein that plays an
important role in hepatic and beta-cell glucose metabolism, indicates
that early-onset noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus may be primarily
a disorder of carbohydrate metabolism.

In a large British pedigree with many cases of MODY (125851) in 5
generations, Stoffel et al. (1992) demonstrated a G-to-C transversion
which converted codon 266 from glycine to arginine. The mutation also
created a HhaI site which allowed them to construct a rapid PCR test for
the mutation. Applying this to cases of classic late-onset type II
diabetes mellitus, they found the same mutation in 1 of 50 patients. All
9 relatives of this patient who had inherited the mutation had type II
diabetes, although 6 others without the mutation also had diabetes. MODY
had not previously been considered in this family.

Sun et al. (1993) analyzed the nucleotide sequence of exon 4 and its
flanking intronic regions of the GCK gene in 4 hyperglycemic members of
a MODY (125851) family and found a deletion of 15 bp, which removed the
T of the GT in the donor splice site of intron 4 and the following 14
basepairs. This deletion resulted in 2 aberrant transcripts: one with
exon 5 missing and the other with activation of a cryptic splice site
leading to the removal of the last 8 codons of exon 4. This intronic
deletion seemed to cause a more severe form of glucose intolerance than
did the missense and nonsense mutations previously reported.

In a 31-year-old man and his 36-year-old sister from the 3-generation
'family 3' with autosomal dominant hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia
(602485) previously studied by Thornton et al. (1998), Glaser et al.
(1998) identified a val455-to-met (V455M) mutation in the glucokinase
gene. When expressed in vitro, the V455M mutation increased the affinity
of glucokinase for glucose, resulting in higher rates of glycolysis at
low glucose concentrations and therefore a higher rate of insulin
secretion at any plasma glucose concentration. The finding confirmed the
importance of glucokinase as a primary regulator of glucose-controlled
insulin secretion in beta cells. This mutation was not found in 37
unrelated white families with hyperinsulinism, including 6 with an
apparently autosomal dominant form.

Njolstad et al. (2001) described an infant girl of Norwegian ancestry
with neonatal diabetes mellitus (606176) that persisted thereafter. The
parents were first cousins, and both had glucose intolerance. At 5 years
of age, epilepsy developed, probably as a sequela of a neonatal brain
abscess. A sister had typical type I diabetes developing at the age of 7
years. The mother had a diagnosis of gestational diabetes at the age of
25 years. The father had impaired fasting glycemia that was treated with
diet. After excluding other candidate genes, Njolstad et al. (2001)
found that the child was homozygous for a T-to-A transversion (ATG-AAG)
at nucleotide 629 in exon 6 of the GCK gene, resulting in a
met210-to-lys mutation (M210K). Her parents and sister were heterozygous
for the mutation, which cosegregated with diabetes or hyperglycemia in
other members of the family. Thus, in this family, heterozygosity caused
GCK-related MODY (125851) and homozygosity caused neonatal-onset
diabetes.

associated with seizures and unconsciousness (see HHF3, 602485),
Christesen et al. (2002) identified heterozygosity for an ala456-to-val
(A456V) substitution in exon 10 of the GCK gene. Kinetic analysis showed
this to be an activating mutation. The boy's normal-weight mother, who

(2004) identified heterozygosity for a de novo tyr214-to-cys (Y214C)
substitution in exon 6 of the GCK gene. Although paternity was
confirmed, the mutation was not found in her parents or her 2 healthy
sisters. Kinetic analysis revealed that this mutation had the highest
activity index (130-fold over wildtype) of all naturally occurring
activating GCK mutations described. Cuesta-Munoz et al. (2004) noted
that this phenotype was considerably more severe than that of previously

In 5 affected members over 3 generations of a mainland Chinese family

of the GCK gene, resulting in a glu339-to-lys (E339K) substitution. The
mutation was not found in unaffected family members or in 200 controls.
SDS-PAGE analysis of a bacterial expression system demonstrated that the
protein yield of mutant GCK was significantly lower than wildtype;
kinetic analysis showed that the E339K mutant had 1.4-fold and 9.9-fold
lower affinity for glucose and ATP, respectively, compared to wildtype.
The mutant GCK also exhibited thermal instability, with a dramatic
decrease in activity at 45 degrees centigrade compared to 55 degrees
centigrade for wildtype; in addition, wildtype GCK maintained 50%
activity at 55 degrees centigrade for 30 minutes, whereas wildtype lost
97% of activity within 30 minutes.

607184	TITLE *607184 SEC24-RELATED GENE FAMILY, MEMBER B; SEC24B
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

In yeast, the Sec23-Sec24 complex is a component of coat protein II
(COPII; see 601924)-coated vesicles that mediate protein transport from
the endoplasmic reticulum. SEC24B is 1 of several mammalian proteins
that show structural and functional homology to yeast Sec24.

CLONING

By searching an EST database for homologs of yeast Sec24 proteins and
screening a size-selected B-lymphocyte cDNA library, Pagano et al.
(1999) isolated a full-length cDNA encoding SEC24B. The deduced
1,268-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of about 137
kD. RNase protection assays demonstrated that SEC24A (607183), SEC24B,
and SEC24C (607185) were expressed simultaneously in several cell lines,
including lines originating from fibroblasts, hepatocytes, and
lymphocytes. The major difference in expression was a constant 2- to
3-fold lower level of expression of SEC24B compared with SEC24A and
SEC24C. Immunofluorescence localization indicated that endogenous SEC24B
is expressed in various human cell lines throughout the cytoplasm, with
more intense perinuclear staining.

Tang et al. (1999) determined that SEC24A and SEC24B share about 56%
sequence identity, while SEC24C and SEC24D (607186) share about 52%
identity. However, the identity shared between these 2 pairs is only
about 20%.

GENE FUNCTION

By gel filtration analysis, Pagano et al. (1999) determined that SEC24B
and SEC24C elute in the same fractions, corresponding to a molecular
mass of 400 kD. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed no evidence for
direct interaction between SEC24B and SEC24C, although both
coimmunoprecipitated with SEC23A. Yeast 2-hybrid assays confirmed the
interaction between SEC24C and SEC23A. The authors determined that the
interacting domain of SEC24C includes the conserved SEC24 family domain,
and the interacting domain SEC23A includes the N terminus up to amino
acid 543.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SEC24A
gene to chromosome 4 (TMAP RH33784).

150325	TITLE *150325 LAMININ, BETA-2; LAMB2
;;LAMININ S; LAMS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Laminin is a heterotrimeric extracellular matrix protein consisting of 3
chains: alpha, beta, and gamma (formerly A, B1, and B2). Several
isoforms of each chain have been identified. Laminin has been shown to
be important for cell differentiation, adhesion, migration, and neurite
outgrowth. The laminin beta-2 chain, formerly S-laminin or the B1s
chain, is a homolog of the laminin beta-1 (LAMB1; 150240) and beta-3
(LAMB3; 150310) chains and is located in synaptic basement membranes
(Vuolteenaho et al., 1993). A part of the S-laminin chain has been shown
to be selectively adhesive for motor neurons and inhibitory for neurite
outgrowth.

CLONING

Wewer et al. (1994) isolated overlapping cDNA clones that encode the
full-length laminin beta-2 chain, formerly called the S chain. A
5,391-nucleotide open reading frame encoded 1,797 amino acids. The human
beta-2 chain was predicted to have all of the 7 structural domains
typical of the beta chains of laminin, including the short cysteine-rich
alpha region. The amino acid sequence of human beta-2 chain showed 86.1%
sequence identity to the rat beta-2 chain, 50% identity to the human
beta-1 chain, and 36.3% identity to the human beta-3 chain.

GENE STRUCTURE

Durkin et al. (1996) determined the structural organization of the human
and mouse genes that encode the laminin beta-2 chain. The human LAMB2
gene on 3p21 and the mouse Lamb2 gene on the distal region of mouse
chromosome 9 show nearly identical organization. Both genes consist of
33 exons occupying approximately 12 kb of genomic DNA. Durkin et al.
(1996) stated that these laminin beta-2 chain genes are the smallest
laminin chain genes characterized to that time; the small size is due to
the unusually small size of their introns. The organization of the
laminin beta-2 chain gene is similar to that of the homologous human
genes for the laminin beta-1 and beta-3 chains. Durkin et al. (1996)
also identified an unusual nonconsensus 5-prime splice site in the first
exon of the human LAMB2 gene. They suggested that inefficient splicing
of this exon, which would not affect the primary sequence of the
protein, may be involved in posttranscriptional regulation of laminin
beta-2 chain gene expression.

MAPPING

Vuolteenaho et al. (1993) used a 2-kb cDNA clone of the S-laminin gene
for Southern blot analysis of a panel of human-mouse somatic cell
hybrids. The LAMS gene segregated concordantly with chromosome 3 and
localized to 3p21-q21 in cell hybrids with chromosome 3 translocations.

Wewer et al. (1994) used the LAMB2 cDNA to assign the gene to 3p21 by
isotopic in situ hybridization. Immunostaining showed that the beta-2
chain is localized to the smooth muscle basement membranes of arteries
while the homologous beta-1 chain is confined to the subendothelial
basement membranes.

GENE FUNCTION

Nishimune et al. (2004) showed that laminin beta-2, a component of the
synaptic cleft at the neuromuscular junction, binds directly to calcium
channels that are required for neurotransmitter release from motor nerve
terminals. This interaction leads to clustering of channels which in
turn recruit other presynaptic components. Perturbation of this
interaction in vivo results in disassembly of neurotransmitter release
sites, resembling defects previously observed in an autoimmune
neuromuscular disorder, Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (600003).
Nishimune et al. (2004) concluded that their results identify an
extracellular ligand of the voltage-gated calcium channel (see 601011)
as well as a new laminin receptor, suggest a model for the development
of nerve terminals, and provide clues to the pathogenesis of a synaptic
disease.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Pierson Syndrome

Zenker et al. (2004) described Pierson syndrome (609049), an autosomal
recessive entity comprising congenital nephrotic syndrome with diffuse
mesangial sclerosis and distinct ocular anomalies with microcoria as the
leading clinical feature. In patients from 5 unrelated families with
Pierson syndrome, Zenker et al. (2004) identified homozygous or compound
heterozygous mutations of the LAMB2 gene (see 150325.0001-150325.0003).
Most disease-associated alleles were truncating mutations. The
respective LAMB2 mutations led to loss of laminin beta-2 expression in
kidney and other tissues studied. In control samples, ocular laminin
beta-2 expression was strongest in the intraocular muscles,
corresponding well to the characteristic hypoplasia of ciliary and
pupillary muscles observed in Pierson syndrome patients.

- Nephrotic Syndrome, Type 5, With or Without Ocular Abnormalities

In affected members of 2 unrelated families with congenital nephrotic
syndrome (NPHS5; 614199), one of which also segregated minor ocular
abnormalities, Hasselbacher et al. (2006) identified homozygosity or
compound heterozygosity for missense mutations in the LAMB2 gene
(150325.0006-150325.0008). The authors speculated that complete
loss-of-function (e.g., truncating) mutations in the LAMB2 gene result
in Pierson syndrome, whereas missense LAMB2 mutations result in
congenital nephrotic syndrome with or without minor ocular
abnormalities.

Maselli et al. (2009) reported a 20-year-old woman with congenital
nephrotic syndrome and ocular abnormalities associated with compound
heterozygous mutations in the LAMB2 gene (150325.0009 and 150325.0010).
In the neonatal period, she had persistently constricted pupils and
massive proteinuria. She received a renal transplant at age 15 months,
which allowed unusually long survival. Motor milestones were delayed,
and she had severe proximal limb muscle weakness. Detailed neuromuscular
examination at age 7 years showed congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS)
with normal acetylcholinesterase (ACHE; 100740) activity. There was a
decremental response of muscle action potential amplitude and a profound
reduction of the quantal content of endplate potentials. Electron
microscopy of the neuromuscular junction showed small axon terminal size
and encasement of nerve endings by the Schwann cell, widening of the
primary synaptic clefts with invasion of the synaptic space by processes
of Schwann cells, moderate simplification of postsynaptic membranes, and
decreased number of synaptic vesicles. Other clinical features included
scoliosis, ptosis, impaired visual acuity, hypoplastic macular areas and
poor foveal reflex, reactive pinpoint pupils, and limited extraocular
movements. Cognition was normal. Maselli et al. (2009) noted that the
muscular phenotype was similar to that observed in Lamb2-null mice
(Noakes et al., 1995).

Mohney et al. (2011) described 11 (9 living) members of an extended
consanguineous Old Order Mennonite family in which 11 (9 living) of 52
members had chronic kidney disease and bilateral chorioretinal
pigmentary changes, with or without retinal detachment, but without
microcoria or neurodevelopmental deficits, segregating in an autosomal
recessive pattern. All affected members had a novel homozygous mutation
in the LAMB2 gene (H147R; 150325.0011).

ANIMAL MODEL

S-laminin/laminin beta-2, a homolog of the much more widely distributed
laminin B1/beta-1 chain (150240), is a major component of adult renal
glomerular basement membrane (GBM). Immature GBM carries beta-1, which
is replaced by beta-2 as development proceeds. Noakes et al. (1995) used
homologous recombination to generate mice that carry a null mutation in
the laminin beta-2 gene and documented defects in the maturation of
their neuromuscular junctions. Focusing on kidneys in a separate study,
Noakes et al. (1995) showed that the mice compensate for renal beta-2
deficiency by forming a GBM that contains laminin beta-1. The mutant GBM
is structurally intact, but glomerular ultrafiltration is impaired. The
defects resemble, in several respects, those seen in human minimal
change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS), a glomerular disorder of unknown
etiology that is most common in children. The mutant mice develop
massive proteinuria. The GBM contains normal complements of several
collagenous and noncollagenous glycoproteins. These results supported
the idea that laminin beta chains are functionally distinct although
they assemble to form similar structures. Laminin beta-2 deficient mice
may provide a model for human congenital or idiopathic nephrotic
syndromes and can be excluded as the cause of Finnish congenital
nephrotic syndrome (256300) because that disorder maps to chromosome 19.
No glomerular phenotype has been noted in animal or humans with
mutations in 2 other laminin genes: alpha-2 (dy/dy dystrophic mice) or
gamma-2 (human junctional epidermolysis bullosa); see 226700.

In Lamb2-null mice, a model of Pierson syndrome, Jarad et al. (2006)
observed ectopic deposition of several laminins and mislocalization of
anionic sites in the GBM, suggesting that the Lamb2 -/- GBM is severely
disorganized although ultrastructurally intact. Albuminuria was
detectable shortly after birth in Lamb2-null mice and preceded podocyte
foot process effacement and loss of slit diaphragms by at least 7 days.
GBM permeability to ferritin was markedly elevated in Lamb2-null mice,
even before widespread foot process effacement, and increased ferritin
permeability was not seen in nephrotic Cd2ap (604241)-null mice, which
have a primary podocyte defect. Jarad et al. (2006) concluded that the
GBM serves as a barrier to protein in vivo and that the glomerular slit
diaphragm alone is not sufficient to prevent the passage of albumin into
the urinary space.

NOMENCLATURE

Burgeson et al. (1994), a group of 14 leading researchers in the field
of connective tissue proteins, adopted a new nomenclature for the
laminins. They were numbered with arabic numerals in the order
discovered. The previous A, B1, and B2 chains, and their isoforms, are
alpha, beta, and gamma, respectively, followed by an arabic numeral to
identify the isoform. For example, the first laminin identified from the
Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumor (EHS) was designated laminin-1 with the
chain composition alpha-1/beta-1/gamma-1. The genes encoding these 3
chains are LAMA1 (150320), LAMB1 (150240), and LAMC1 (150290).

PIERSON SYNDROME
LAMB2, 1-BP DEL, 3015G

In affected members of a consanguineous Lebanese family with a perinatal
lethal form of Pierson syndrome (609049) described by Zenker et al.
(2004), Zenker et al. (2004) identified a homozygous 1-bp deletion in
the LAMB2 gene, 3015delG, resulting in a premature stop at codon 1150.

Zenker et al. (2005) provided evidence that the original sibs with
microcoria-congenital nephrosis syndrome (609049) reported by Pierson et
al. (1963) were compound heterozygous for mutations in the LAMB2 gene.
In the healthy mother and paternal aunt of the sibs, Zenker et al.
(2005) identified 2 different heterozygous mutations in the LAMB2 gene:
a 2067C-G transversion, resulting in a tyr689-to-ter (Y689X)
substitution, and a 1122T-A transversion, resulting in a cys374-to-ter
(C374X) substitution (150325.0005), respectively.

LAMB2, ARG246GLN

In 2 affected sibs in a consanguineous Turkish family who had isolated
congenital nephrotic syndrome with no ocular abnormalities (NPHS5;
614199), Hasselbacher et al. (2006) identified homozygosity for a 737G-A

In 2 affected sibs in a German Caucasian family who had isolated
congenital nephrotic syndrome with mild ocular abnormalities, including
myopia, fundus abnormality, and nystagmus (NPHS5; 614199), Hasselbacher
et al. (2006) identified compound heterozygosity for 3 mutations in the
LAMB2 gene: a 4140C-A transversion and a 4177C-T transition in exon 26
resulting in asn1380-to-lys (N1380K) and leu1393-to-phe (L1393F)
mutations, respectively, located on the same, maternally inherited
allele, and a 961T-C transition in exon 8 resulting in a cys321-to-arg

.0009
NEPHROTIC SYNDROME, TYPE 5, WITH OCULAR ABNORMALITIES
LAMB2, 1-BP DEL, 1478G

In a 20-year-old woman with congenital nephrotic syndrome and ocular
abnormalities (NPHS5; 614199), Maselli et al. (2009) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the LAMB2 gene: a 1-bp deletion
(1478delG) in exon 11 and a 1-bp deletion (4804delC; 150325.0010) in
exon 29. Both mutations resulted in premature termination with no
protein expression. Each mutation was inherited from an unaffected
parent. The clinical history of the patient was unusual for the long
survival due to successful kidney transplant at age 15 months. She had
delayed motor development and proximal muscle weakness that was
confirmed to be a congenital myasthenic syndrome later in childhood.
There was a decremental response of muscle action potential amplitude
and a profound reduction of the quantal content of endplate potentials.
Electron microscopy of the neuromuscular junction showed small axon
terminal size and encasement of nerve endings by the Schwann cell,
widening of the primary synaptic clefts with invasion of the synaptic
space by processes of Schwann cells, moderate simplification of
postsynaptic membranes, and decreased number of synaptic vesicles. Other
clinical features included scoliosis, ptosis, impaired visual acuity,
hypoplastic macular areas and poor foveal reflex, reactive pinpoint
pupils, and limited extraocular movements. Cognition was normal. Maselli
et al. (2009) noted that the muscular phenotype was similar to that

.0011
NEPHROTIC SYNDROME, TYPE 5, WITH OCULAR ABNORMALITIES
LAMB2, HIS147ARG

Mohney et al. (2011) described an extended consanguineous Old Order
Mennonite family with chronic kidney disease and bilateral chorioretinal
pigmentary changes, with or without retinal detachment, but without
microcoria or neurodevelopmental deficits (NPHS5; 614199). All affected
members were homozygous for a 440A-G transition in the LAMB2 gene,
resulting in a his145-to-arg (H147R) substitution. The mutation was
located in a highly conserved site in the N-terminal domain VI of LAMB2.
All obligate carriers in the family were heterozygous for the mutation,
and normal sibs were either heterozygous or wildtype. Screening of 91
non-Mennonite control subjects did not identify the mutation, whereas
screening of 96 Old Order Mennonite control samples revealed 2
heterozygotes, yielding a carrier frequency of 2.1%. The authors
considered it to be a variant of Pierson syndrome (see 609049).

612533	TITLE *612533 THAP DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 4; THAP4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases, Roussigne et al. (2003) identified several
proteins containing an N-terminal THAP domain, including THAP4. The THAP
domain of the deduced 577-amino acid THAP4 protein includes a C2CH
signature, an AVPTIF box, and several other conserved amino acids.

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the THAP4 gene to chromosome 2q37.3 based on an
alignment of the THAP4 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF132970) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

612901	TITLE *612901 TUBULIN, BETA-1; TUBB1
;;TUBULIN, BETA, CLASS VI
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Microtubules are involved in a wide variety of cellular processes,
including mitosis, morphogenesis, platelet formation, and mobility of
cilia and flagella. Circulating platelets carry a single marginal
microtubule coil that is wound in 8 to 12 turns and is responsible for
platelet shape. TUBB1 is the major beta-tubulin expressed in platelets
and megakaryocytes and is required for optimal platelet assembly (Wang
et al., 1986; Schulze et al., 2004).

CLONING

Wang et al. (1986) cloned mouse Tubb1 from a bone marrow cDNA library.
Northern blot analysis of several adult mouse tissues detected highest
Tubb1 expression in spleen, with much lower expression in lung. Weak
expression was detected in spleen, liver, and lung of young mice.

Using database analysis, Leandro-Garcia et al. (2010) identified 8 major
beta-tubulins, including TUBB1. Quantitative RT-PCR of 21 normal human
tissues detected high TUBB1 expression in hematopoietic tissues,
predominantly blood leukocytes, where it was the predominant
beta-tubulin, with lower expression in fetal liver and bone marrow.
Little to no expression was detected in other tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen, Schulze et al. (2004) found that the C
terminus of mouse Tubb1 interacted with the protease inhibitor Slpi
(107285). Association of Slpi with microtubules and its capacity to
inhibit neutrophil elastase (ELA2; 130130) was lost in Tubb1 -/-
platelets.

MAPPING

Freson et al. (2005) stated that the TUBB1 gene maps to chromosome
20q13.3.

Schulze et al. (2004) stated that the mouse Tubb1 gene maps to
chromosome 2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Freson et al. (2005) identified a heterozygous gln43-to-pro (Q43P) SNP
in the TUBB1 gene in 8 (24.2%) of 33 unrelated individuals with
macrothrombocytopenia (613112). However, since inheritance in these 8
families was more consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance and no
other TUBB1 variants were identified, it was unclear how much this SNP
contributed to the phenotype. Freson et al. (2005) found the
heterozygous Q43P change in 10.6% of 272 healthy control individuals.
Control individuals with the Q43P change had normal platelet counts, but
larger and rounder, more spherical platelets compared to those without
the change. The abnormally round platelets showed disturbed tubulin
organization and decreased TUBB1 protein levels. Functional studies
showed slightly decreased aggregation under certain conditions. A
case-control study identified the Q43P change in 5.2% of 573 patients
with cardiovascular disease, about half of the prevalence in controls.
Stratification by sex showed the effect only in men. The authors
suggested that this common SNP may protect against cardiovascular
disease in men.

In a Japanese boy and his mother with autosomal dominant
macrothrombocytopenia (613112), Kunishima et al. (2009) identified a
heterozygous mutation in the TUBB1 gene (R318W; 612901.0001).

ANIMAL MODEL

Schwer et al. (2001) obtained Tubb1 -/- mice at the expected mendelian
frequency. Tubb1 -/- mice appeared normal and showed no sign of
hemorrhage, but their average platelet counts were less than 50% of
wildtype. Tubb1 +/- heterozygotes had intermediate platelet levels.
About half of megakaryocytes cultured from wildtype fetal mouse livers
showed a rich network of proplatelets. A smaller fraction of Tubb1 +/-
cells showed these extensions, whereas Tubb1 -/- cells elaborated very
few proplatelets. Circulating platelets of Tubb1 -/- mice lacked the
characteristic discoid shape and had defective marginal bands with
reduced microtubule coilings. Tubb1 -/- mice had prolonged bleeding
time, and their platelets showed an attenuated response to thrombin (F2;
176930).

Cavalier King Charles Spaniel dogs have a high prevalence of inherited
macrothrombocytopenia. Davis et al. (2008) identified an asp249-to-asn
(D249N) mutation in the canine Tubb1 gene as causative of the disorder.
Electron microscopy and immunofluorescence studies suggested that
platelet microtubules were present, but were most likely unstable and
decreased in number.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MACROTHROMBOCYTOPENIA, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT, TUBB1-RELATED
TUBB1, ARG318TRP

In a Japanese boy and his mother with autosomal dominant
macrothrombocytopenia (613112), Kunishima et al. (2009) identified a
heterozygous 952C-T transition in the TUBB1 gene, resulting in an
arg318-to-trp (R318W) substitution. The mutation was not found in 108
healthy controls. The substitution was predicted to be buried inside the
3-dimension molecule near the alpha and beta intradimer interface and
may disrupt side chain interactions. Studies of resting patient
platelets showed normal TUBB1 localization in the marginal microtubule
band and normal electrophoretic mobility, but decreased expression
levels compared to controls. Cultured mature megakaryocytes from the
patient showed large and irregular bleb protrusions, suggesting impaired
megakaryocyte fragmentation and release of large platelets. Platelet
aggregation studies were normal. Further studies indicated that the
thrombocytopenia resulted from peripheral destruction, not platelet
underproduction. Overall, the results suggested that the TUBB1 R318W
mutation resulted in instability of the protein. Kunishima et al. (2009)
suggested that the mutation may dominantly affect microtubule assembly
in some manner. Alternatively, mutant TUBB1 was not transported properly
from megakaryocytes into platelets.

614463	TITLE *614463 NMYC DOWNSTREAM-REGULATED GENE 4; NDRG4
;;SMOOTH MUSCLE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 8; SMAP8;;
KIAA1180
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Hirosawa et al. (1999) cloned NDRG4. The deduced protein
contains 273 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA detected highest expression in
adult and fetal brain and adult heart, followed by lung and testis.
Lower expression was detected in other adult tissues examined, but
little to no expression was detected in fetal liver. High NDRG4
expression was detected in all specific adult brain regions examined,
with highest expression in amygdala, cerebellum, and thalamus.

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to NDRG1 (605262),
followed by 3-prime and 5-prime RACE of human brain and heart cDNA
libraries and cap-site hunting, Zhou et al. (2001) cloned 3 splice
variants of NDRG4. The variants NDRG4B and NDRG4B-var, which were
obtained from the brain library, encode deduced proteins of 339 and 352
amino acids with calculated molecular masses of 37.1 and 38.5 kD,
respectively. Compared with NDRG4B, NDRG4B-var has a 14-amino acid
insertion near the C terminus. The variant NDRG4H, which was obtained
from the heart library, encodes a deduced 371-amino acid protein with a
calculated molecular mass of 40.6 kD. NDRG4H differs from NDRG4B and
NDRG4B-var at its N-terminal end, and it lacks the 14-amino acid
insertion. Northern blot analysis detected NDRG4 transcripts of about
3.2 kb in brain and heart only. Variant-specific probes showed NDRG4B
expression in brain only, whereas NDRG4H was expressed in both brain and
heart, with higher expression in heart. RT-PCR confirmed expression of
all 3 variants in brain and of NDRG4H in heart. RNA dot-blot analysis
revealed NDRG4 expression in spinal cord, all specific brain regions
examined, and all specific heart regions examined except aorta.
Expression was also detected in spleen, lymph node, testis, adrenal
gland, and fetal brain and heart, but not in other tissues examined. In
situ hybridization of normal adult brain detected NDRG4 mRNA in
cytoplasm of neurons in cerebral cortex, cerebellum, mesencephalon,
pons, medulla oblongata, and spinal cord. No signal was detected in
peripheral nerves or other cell types, such as glial cells. Western blot
analysis of endogenous or exogenously expressed proteins showed that
NDRG4B, NDRG4B-var, and NDRG4H had apparent molecular masses of 37, 39,
and 41 kD, respectively.

Using expression profiling to identify genes expressed in aortic smooth
muscle, followed by screening a heart cDNA library, Nishimoto et al.
(2003) cloned NDRG4, which they called SMAP8. The deduced 371-amino acid
protein has a calculated molecular mass of 40.7 kD. Northern blot
analysis detected high expression of an approximately 3.3-kb transcript
in heart and brain, with little to no expression in other tissues
examined. PCR analysis showed moderate expression in aorta and vascular
smooth muscle cells. Western blot analysis of heart and brain detected
SMAP8 at an apparent molecular mass of about 45 kD. SMAP8 localized to
the cytoplasmic fraction of transfected A10 embryonic rat aortic smooth
muscle cells.

By in situ hybridization of adult mouse brain, Yamamoto et al. (2011)
detected wide distribution of Ndrg4 in neurons, but not in astrocytes.
Western blot analysis of adult mouse brain detected 3 Ndrg4 isoforms
representing orthologs of human NDRG4B, NDRG4B-var, and NDRG4H.

GENE FUNCTION

Nishimoto et al. (2003) showed that homocysteine upregulated SMAP8
expression in primary human aortic smooth muscle cells and rat A10
cells, but not in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Proliferation
and migration of A10 cells significantly decreased following expression
of human SMAP8. SMAP8 was phosphorylated by a serine/threonine kinase
via activation of a PDGF (see 173430) signaling pathway. In addition,
ERK1 (MAPK3; 601795)/ERK2 (MAPK1; 176948) and MEK1 (MAP2K1; 176872)/MEK2
(MAP2K2; 601263) were activated in SMAP8-transfected A10 cells.

Hongo et al. (2006) found that overexpression of 1 of the 6 isoforms of
rat Ndrg4, Ndrg4c2, in PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells reduced NGF (see
162030)-induced phosphorylation of Elk1 (311040), a nuclear target of
Erk. Reporter gene assays revealed that Ndrg4c2 suppressed Elk1-mediated
activation of a serum response element.

By RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analysis, Schilling et al. (2009)
found that NDRG4 expression was increased in glioblastoma multiforme
(GBM; see 137800) compared with normal human astrocytes. Knockdown of
NDRG4 via short hairpin RNA reduced the viability of GBM cells via G1
cell cycle arrest and subsequent apoptosis. Knockdown of NDRG4 also
reduced the viability of several GBM cell lines and primary astrocytes.
Knockdown of NDRG4 in GBM tumor xenografts reduced tumor growth
following intracranial injection in immunocompromised mice.
Overexpression of NDRG4B or NDRG4H did not affect cell viability.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhou et al. (2001) determined that the NDRG4 gene contains 17 exons and
spans 26 kb. Exons 1 and 2 are specific for NDRG4H, exon 3 is specific
for NDRG4B and NDGR4B-var, and exon 16 is specific for NDRG4B-var. The
region upstream of exon 1 contains a GGCG sequence that may represent a
TATA-less promoter for NDRG4H expression. The region upstream of exon 3
contains a consensus TATA box and 2 CCAAT sequences and may represent
the promoter for NDRG4B and NDRG4B-var expression.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Zhou et al. (2001) mapped the NDRG4 gene
to chromosome 16q21-q22.3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yamamoto et al. (2011) found that Ndrg4 -/- mice were born at the
expected mendelian ratio, appeared normal, and were fertile. However,
Ndrg4 -/- mice showed deficits in spatial learning and memory, and they
exhibited increased sensitivity to ischemic stress following middle
cerebral artery occlusion. Consistent with these findings, Ndrg4 -/-
mice had reduced expression of the neuroprotective factor Bdnf (113505).

;;ADP-RIBOSYLATION FACTOR 2, FORMERLY; ARF2, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Monaco et al. (1990) used degenerate PCR with genomic DNA to identify a
member of the human ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) gene family. The gene,
designated ARF4, encodes a predicted 180-amino acid protein that is
approximately 80% identical to the other human ARFs (see, for example,
103180) and 73% identical to yeast ARF. By DNA sequence analysis, the
authors stated that ARF4 is the most divergent member of the human ARFs.
A processed pseudogene that is 94% identical at the nucleotide level was
also identified. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.8-kb mRNA in IMR-32
neuroblastoma cells.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Vorobieva et al. (1995) mapped
the ARF4 gene, which they called ARF2, to chromosome 3p21.2-p21.1.

Kim (1998) mapped the ARF4 gene to 3p14.1 by PCR analysis of somatic
cell hybrid DNA and radiation hybrid analysis.

607038	TITLE *607038 OTOANCORIN; OTOA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The OTOA gene encodes otoancorin, which belongs to a group of
noncollagenous glycoproteins of the acellular gels of the inner ear that
have been described in mammals. Examples include alpha-tectorin
(602574), beta-tectorin (602653), and otogelin (OTOG; 604487), all of
which are unique to the inner ear (Zwaenepoel et al., 2002).

CLONING

Zwaenepoel et al. (2002) reported the first example of a protein,
otoancorin (OTOA), specifically located at the interface between the
apical surface of the sensory epithelia and their overlying acellular
gels, and also entirely specific for the inner ear. By searching a
subtracted cDNA library prepared from sensory epithelia of the mouse
vestibular apparatus, followed by searching sequence databases, they
obtained cDNAs encoding mouse and human OTOA. The predicted 1,153-amino
acid human protein is 77% identical to the mouse protein. Mouse Otoa has
a signal peptide, 11 potential N-glycosylation sites, and a C-terminal
sequence characteristic of GPI-linked membrane-bound proteins. RT-PCR
analysis detected expression of mouse Otoa only in the inner ear.

GENE STRUCTURE

By sequence analysis using a gene-prediction program, Zwaenepoel et al.
(2002) determined that the OTOA gene has 28 exons spanning approximately
82 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Zwaenepoel et al. (2002) mapped the OTOA
gene between markers D16S3046 and D16S412 on chromosome 16p12.2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Since the mouse Otoa gene is expressed only in the inner ear, Zwaenepoel
et al. (2002) considered the human gene to be an attractive candidate
gene for isolated deafness. They searched a collection of 200 large
affected families to determine whether the deafness locus in any mapped
to 16p12.2. In a consanguineous Palestinian family, the moderate to
severe prelingual sensorineural recessive deafness was shown to
segregate with a locus, termed DFNB22 (607039), on chromosome
16p13.1-q11.2. Zwaenepoel et al. (2002) identified a T-to-C transition
at the exon 12/intron 12 junction of the OTOA gene (607038.0001) in the
homozygous state in 1 affected child of this family. The mutation was
found to cosegregate with the hearing impairment in this kindred and was
not detected in 417 Jordanian, Lebanese, Palestinian, and Jewish (mainly
Sephardic and Yemenite) individuals with normal hearing.

In affected sibs from a consanguineous Palestinian family with autosomal
recessive prelingual deafness, Shahin et al. (2010) identified a
homozygous 500-kb deletion that resulted in complete deletion of the
OTOA gene (607038.0002). The deletion was flanked by segmental
duplications at chromosome 16q, suggesting nonallelic homologous
recombination as the mechanism. The deletion was observed in the
heterozygous state in 3 (1.0%) of 288 unrelated Palestinian controls.

In a large consanguineous Palestinian family, Zwaenepoel et al. (2002)
found that moderate to severe prelingual sensorineural recessive
deafness (DFNB22; 607039) segregated with a mutation in the OTOA gene, a
T-to-C transition at the exon 12/intron 12 junction in the homozygous
state. The IVS12+2T-C mutation affected the invariant T of the donor
splice site GT dinucleotide and was expected to lead to aberrant
splicing, such as exon 12 skipping, resulting in an in-frame deletion of
72 amino acids, or the use of a cryptic site.

In affected sibs from a consanguineous Palestinian family with autosomal

614757	TITLE *614757 INTERFERON-INDUCED TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN 5; IFITM5
;;FRAGILIS 4, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Lange et al. (2003) cloned mouse Ifitm5, which they called fragilis-4,
and they identified human IFITM5 by database analysis. The deduced human
protein contains 132 amino acids and is predicted to have 2
transmembrane domains. The mouse and human proteins share highest
conservation in a central region that includes the first transmembrane
domain and the beginning of the second transmembrane domain. This
central region also shares highest similarity among IFITM family
members. Lange et al. (2003) determined that IFITM5 is 1 of only 2 IFITM
genes conserved from mouse to human (see EVOLUTION).

GENE STRUCTURE

Lange et al. (2003) determined that the IFITM5 gene contains 2 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Lange et al. (2003) mapped the IFITM5 gene
to an IFITM gene cluster on chromosome 11p15.5. The order of the genes,
from telomere to centromere, is IFITM5, IFITM2 (605578), IFITM1
(604456), and IFITM3 (605579), and the cluster spans about 26.5 kb.
Lange et al. (2003) stated that IFITM2 maps to the plus strand and that
all other IFITM genes map to the minus strand. However, Gross (2012)
determined that, in addition to IFITM2, the IFITM1 gene maps to the plus
strand based on an alignment of the IFITM1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK
BC000897) with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

Lange et al. (2003) mapped the mouse Ifitm gene cluster to a region of
chromosome 7F5 that shares homology of synteny with human chromosome
11p15.5. The mouse Ifitm gene cluster contains 5 genes, whereas the
human cluster contains only 4 genes.

EVOLUTION

By phylogenetic analysis, Lange et al. (2003) found that only 2 mouse
fragilis genes, fragilis-4 (Ifitm5) and either fragilis (Ifitm3),
fragilis-2 (Ifitm1), or fragilis-3 (Ifitm2), have been conserved from
mouse to human. They suggested that subsequent gene duplications may
have occurred independently in both species.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

After mapping the locus for osteogenesis imperfecta type V (OI5; 610967)
in a Korean family to a region of chromosome 11 containing the IFITM5
gene, Cho et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous mutation in the
5-prime untranslated region of this gene (-14C-T; 614757.0001) in 19
affected Korean individuals (13 from 3 families and 6 simplex
individuals). The mutation was not found in unaffected family members or
in 200 unrelated control chromosomes from the same ethnic group.

Sempler et al. (2012) independently identified heterozygosity for the
-14C-T mutation in 2 unrelated patients with OI type V. The mutation
occurred de novo in both.

OSTEOGENESIS IMPERFECTA, TYPE V
IFITM5, -14C-T

In 19 Korean individuals (13 from 3 families and 6 simplex individuals)
with osteogenesis imperfecta type V (OI5; 610967), Cho et al. (2012)
identified a C-T transition 5-prime UTR of the IFITM5 gene (-14C-T).
Sempler et al. (2012) identified the same mutation in 2 unrelated
individuals with OI5. The mutation was predicted to generate an in-frame
translation start codon that would add 5 amino acids
(Met-Ala-Leu-Glu-Pro) to the N terminus of IFITM5, which was confirmed
in transfection experiments.

CLONING

Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS; 194050) is a developmental disorder
caused by haploinsufficiency of genes in 7q11.23. The deleted DNA
associated with WBS spans more than 1 Mb. Using an STS that maps close
to the common WBS centromeric deletion breakpoint, Meng et al. (1998)
isolated human testis cDNAs corresponding to a novel gene, FKBP6,
located within the WBS deletion region. The FKBP6 gene has 9 exons and
is oriented in a 5-prime to 3-prime direction from centromere to
telomere. FKBP6 is completely contained within a 35-kb cosmid; the DNA
corresponding to the insert of this cosmid was deleted in 40 of 40 WBS
individuals. The predicted 327-amino acid FKBP6 protein shows structural
homology to FKBP immunophilins, which are cellular receptors for the
immunosuppressive drugs FK506 and rapamycin. FKBP6 contains an
N-terminal FK506-binding peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (rotamase) domain and
3 imperfect C-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs. Northern
blot analysis detected an approximately 1.6-kb FKBP6 transcript in all
human tissues examined, with exceptionally high expression in testis and
high expression in heart, skeletal muscle, liver, and kidney.

Metcalfe et al. (2005) described a Bulgarian father and son with
Williams-Beuren syndrome who appeared to have a common heterozygous
deletion, confirming the expected dominant transmission and adding to
the few familial cases reported. The deletion included the FKBP6 gene
which has been shown to play a role in homologous chromosome pairing in
meiosis and male fertility in mouse models. Metcalfe et al. (2005)
suggested that haploinsufficiency for FKBP6 does not appear to preclude
male fertility in WBS, although male infertility involving this gene has
the potential to follow the mouse model as a human autosomal recessive
condition.

ANIMAL MODEL

Crackower et al. (2003) showed that Fkbp6 localizes to meiotic
chromosome cores and regions of homologous chromosome synapsis. Targeted
inactivation of Fkbp6 in mice resulted in aspermic males and the absence
of normal pachytene spermatocytes. Moreover, Crackower et al. (2003)
identified the deletion of Fkbp6 exon 8 as the causative mutation in
spontaneously sterile male 'aspermia' (as/as) mutant rats. Loss of Fkbp6
results in abnormal pairing and misalignments between homologous
chromosomes, nonhomologous partner switches, and autosynapsis of X
chromosome cores in meiotic spermatocytes. Fertility and meiosis are
normal in Fkbp6 mutant females. Thus, Crackower et al. (2003) concluded
that Fkbp6 is a component of the synaptonemal complex essential for
sex-specific fertility and for the fidelity of homologous chromosome
pairing in meiosis.

;;INTERLEUKIN 1 FAMILY, MEMBER 8; IL1F8;;
FAMILY OF INTERLEUKIN 1-ETA;;
FIL1-ETA;;
INTERLEUKIN 1 SUPERFAMILY E;;
IL1H2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the IL1 (see IL1A; 147760) family, such as IL1F8, are
structurally related cytokines and cell surface receptors that mediate
inflammation. IL1F8 is part of an IL1 signaling system in epithelia and
has proinflammatory properties (summary by Johnston et al., 2011).

CLONING

By PCR analysis of an osteoclastoma library, Smith et al. (2000)
identified a cDNA encoding a novel member of the IL1 family, which they
designated FIL1-eta. The deduced 157-amino acid protein, like FIL1-delta
(IL1F5; 605507), contains neither a signal peptide nor a prodomain. It
shares 46% sequence identity with FIL1-epsilon (IL1F6; 605509). PCR
analyses detected expression in tonsil, bone marrow, heart, placenta,
lung, testis, and colon but not in other tissues or in any hematopoietic
cell lines. Modeling indicated that FIL1-eta has a conserved 12-stranded
beta-trefoil structure.

By searching public and private EST databases for IL1 homologs, Kumar et
al. (2000) identified a cDNA encoding IL1H2, which is identical to
FIL1-eta. By Northern blot analysis, they detected no IL1H2 transcripts.

GENE FUNCTION

Using RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analysis, Johnston et al. (2011)
demonstrated increased expression of IL1F5, IL1F6, IL1F8, and IL1F9
(605542) in psoriasis (177900) plaque compared with uninvolved skin from
psoriasis patients. Analysis of 2 mouse psoriasis models produced
similar results. IL1A and TNF (191160) induced expression of the IL1F
transcripts in normal human keratinocytes. Microarray analysis showed
that IL1F cytokines, particularly IL1F8, increased mRNA expression of
human beta-defensins and secretion of HBD2 (DEFB4; 602215) and HBD3
(DEFB103A; 606611). Johnston et al. (2011) concluded that IL1F cytokines
have important roles in inflammatory skin diseases and may be targets
for antipsoriatic therapies.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Smith et al. (2000) mapped the FIL1-eta
gene to chromosome 2q between D2S121 and D2S110, where other members of
the IL1 gene family are located.

Nicklin et al. (2002) determined that the gene order within the IL1 gene
cluster on chromosome 2, from centromere to telomere, is IL1A-IL1B
(147720)-IL1F7 (IL37; 605510)-IL1F9-IL1F6-IL1F8-IL1F5-IL1F10
(615296)-IL1RN (147679). Of these, only IL1A, IL1B, and IL36B are
transcribed toward the centromere.

Gross (2011) mapped the IL1F8 gene to chromosome 2q13 based on an
alignment of the IL1F8 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC101831) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

188840	TITLE *188840 TITIN; TTN
;;CONNECTIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Titin, or connectin, is a giant muscle protein expressed in the cardiac
and skeletal muscles that spans half of the sarcomere from Z line to M
line. Titin plays a key role in muscle assembly, force transmission at
the Z line, and maintenance of resting tension in the I band region
(Itoh-Satoh et al., 2002).

CLONING

Labeit et al. (1990) showed that partial titin cDNAs encode a regular
pattern of 2 types of 100-residue motif, each of which probably folds
into a separate domain type. Such motifs are present in several
evolutionarily divergent proteins, all of which are likely to interact
with myosin.

Labeit and Kolmerer (1995) determined the cDNA sequence of human cardiac
titin. The 82-kb cDNA predicted a 26,926-amino acid protein with a
molecular mass of 2,993 kD. Ninety percent of the mass is contained in a
repetitive structure composed of 244 copies of 100-residue repeats that
encode 112 immunoglobulin-like and 132 fibronectin type III domains.
Alternative splicing accounts for tissue-specific titin isoforms. In the
central part of I band titin, cardiac and skeletal titins branch into
distinct isoforms; in heart, differential splicing includes about 3.5 kb
of cDNA within the I band region of titin, whereas in skeletal muscle,
22.5 kb of cDNA is included. In addition, a sequence element rich in
proline (P), glutamic acid (E), lysine (K), and valine (V) residues,
referred to as the PEVK domain, comprises 163 residues in cardiac titin
and 2,174 residues in skeletal titin.

Bang et al. (2001) determined that the complete sequence of human titin
encodes a 38,138-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 4,200 kD.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bang et al. (2001) determined that titin has 363 exons.

Titin contains 6 M band-encoding exons at the C terminus, exons 358 to
363, referred to as Mex1 to Mex6. These exons are constitutively
expressed in both skeletal and cardiac muscle (Carmignac et al., 2007).

GENE FUNCTION

Labeit et al. (1990) suggested that the I band of titin makes elastic
connections between the thick filament and the Z line within the
sarcomere. The A band of titin appears to bind to the thick filament,
where it may regulate filament length and assembly. The architecture of
sequences in the A band region of titin suggested to Labeit and Kolmerer
(1995) why thick filament structure is conserved among vertebrates. In
the I band region, comparison of titin sequences from muscles of
different passive tension identified 2 elements that correlate with
tissue stiffness, suggesting that titin may act as 2 springs in series.
The differential expression of the springs provides a molecular
explanation for the diversity of sarcomere length and resting tension in
vertebrate striated muscles.

Ma and Wang (2002) presented evidence that the PEVK segment of titin,
which contains numerous SH3-binding motifs, and the Z line protein
myopalladin (MYPN; 608517) may play signaling roles in targeting and
orienting nebulin (NEB; 161650) to the Z line during sarcomere assembly.

The I band region of titin contains tandem arrays of immunoglobulin
domains. Immunoglobulin domain-27 (I27) unfolds through an intermediate
under force in which the A-strand is detached. The lengthening of I27
without unfolding forms a stable intermediate that is believed to be an
important component of titin elasticity (Marszalek et al., 1999).
Williams et al. (2003) used mutant titins to study the role of the
partly unfolded intermediate of titin. Under physiologic forces, the
partly unfolded intermediate of immunoglobulin domain-27 does not
contribute to mechanical strength. Williams et al. (2003) also proposed
a unified forced unfolding model of all I27 analogs studied, and
concluded that I27 can withstand higher forces in muscle than had
previously been predicted.

Titin interacts with many sarcomeric proteins: telethonin (TCAP; 604488)
and alpha-actinin (e.g., 102575) at the Z line region; calpain-3 (CAPN3;
114240) and obscurin (OBSCN; 608616) at the I band region; and
myosin-binding protein C (MYBPC3; 600958), calmodulin (CALM1; 114180),
and CAPN3 at the M line region (Bang et al., 2001). In a review, Hackman
et al. (2003) noted that titin has at least 2 different CAPN3-binding
sites: one is in region N2A in I band titin and the other is in the Mex5
exon of M line titin. Obscurin (608616) interacts with both the
NH2-terminal of Z disc titin and the M line titin during different
phases of myofibrillogenesis, and MURF1 (606131) binds titin close to
the kinase domain at the periphery of the M line titin.

Lange et al. (2005) identified a signaling complex where the titin
protein kinase domain (TK) interacts with the zinc finger protein NBR1
(166945) through a mechanically inducible conformation. NBR1 targets the
ubiquitin-associated p62/SQSTM1 (601530) to sarcomeres, and p62 in turn
interacts with MURF2 (606469), a muscle-specific RING-B-box E3 ligase
and ligand of the transactivation domain of the serum response
transcription factor (SRF; 600589). Nuclear translocation of MURF2 was
induced by mechanical inactivity and caused reduction of nuclear SRF and
repression of transcription.

Sarparanta et al. (2010) observed that M-band-localized myospryn (CMYA5;
612193) was in close proximity (less than 40 nm) to the
M-band-associated titin C terminus in mouse muscle sections. Yeast
2-hybrid analysis of human fetal and adult skeletal muscle cDNA
libraries showed that C-terminal domains of titin interacted with a
C-terminal fragment of myospryn. Reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation
analysis confirmed the interaction between the titin and myospryn
fragments.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Li et al. (2002) used protein engineering and single-molecule atomic
force microscopy to examine the mechanical components that form the
elastic region of human cardiac titin. They showed that when these
mechanical elements are combined, they explain the macroscopic behavior
of titin in intact muscle.

Using x-ray crystallography, Zou et al. (2006) showed how the amino
terminus of the longest filament component in the Z disc of muscle, the
giant muscle protein titin, is assembled into an antiparallel (2:1)
sandwich complex by the Z disc ligand telethonin. The pseudosymmetric
structure of telethonin mediates a unique palindromic arrangement of 2
titin filaments, a type of molecular assembly previously found only in
protein-DNA complexes. Zou et al. (2006) confirmed its unique
architecture in vivo by protein complementation assays, and in vitro by
experiments using fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Zou et al.
(2006) proposed a model that provides a molecular paradigm of how major
sarcomeric filaments are crosslinked, anchored, and aligned within
complex cytoskeletal networks.

MAPPING

By studies of DNA from a panel of Chinese hamster/human hybrid cell
lines, Labeit et al. (1990) assigned the TTN locus to 2q13-q33. Another
myofibrillar protein, nebulin, maps to 2q31-q32. The fact that the 2
genes are close together suggests that their regulation may be
coordinated, possibly to control the ratio of the proteins. In the
mouse, the titin gene was also mapped to chromosome 2. Muller-Seitz et
al. (1993) showed that the murine equivalents of the human TTN, NEB, and
CHRNA1 (100690) genes are all on mouse chromosome 2.

Using radiation hybrid mapping, Pelin et al. (1997) reassigned the titin
gene to the vicinity of the markers D2S384 and D2S364 on 2q24.3. They
concluded that the TTN gene lies outside the candidate region for NEM2
(256030), the autosomal recessive form of nemaline myopathy.

Carmignac et al. (2007) noted that the TTN gene maps to chromosome
2q31.2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Cardiomyopathy

In 1 of 82 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (CMH) who had no
mutation in known disease genes, Satoh et al. (1999) identified a
mutation in the TTN gene (188840.0001) that was not found in more than
500 normal chromosomes and increased the binding affinity of titin to
alpha-actinin (see 102575) in the yeast 2-hybrid assay. The form of
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy due to mutation in the TTN gene has been
designated CMH9 (613765).

In 2 unrelated families with autosomal dominant dilated cardiomyopathy
(CMD) linked to 2q31 (CMD1G; 604145), Gerull et al. (2002) identified 2
different heterozygous mutations in the TTN gene (188840.0002;
188840.0003).

In 4 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, Itoh-Satoh et al. (2002)
identified 4 different mutations in the TTN gene
(188840.0007-188840.0010). Two of the cases were familial.

Herman et al. (2012) used next-generation sequencing to analyze the TTN
gene in 203 individuals with dilated cardiomyopathy, 231 with
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and 249 controls. The frequency of TTN
mutations was significantly higher among individuals with CMD (27%) than
among those with CMH (1%) or controls (3%). In the 3 patients with CMH
in whom TTN truncating or splicing mutations were identified, concurrent
analyses revealed a pathogenic mutation in the known CMH genes MYH7
(160760) or MYBPC3 (600958). In CMD families, TTN mutations cosegregated
with dilated cardiomyopathy, with highly observed penetrance after the
age of 40 years. Mutations associated with CMD were overrepresented in
the titin A-band but were absent from the Z-disc and M-band regions of
titin. Herman et al. (2012) concluded that TTN truncating mutations are
a common cause of dilated cardiomyopathy, occurring in approximately 25%
of familial CMD cases and in 18% of sporadic cases, and suggested that
TTN truncations rarely, if ever, cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Lopes et al. (2013) analyzed the coding, intronic, and regulatory
regions of 41 cardiovascular genes in 223 unrelated patients with CMH
using high-throughput sequencing technology. They found 219 rare
variants in 142 (63.6%) of the patients: 30 patients (13%) had titin
candidate variants in isolation, 22 (10%) had titin variants only in
association with desmosomal gene candidate variants or ion channel
disease-associated variants, and 171 (77%) carried a TTN candidate
variant in association with sarcomere, Z-disc, or calcium-handling gene
variants. Lopes et al. (2013) noted that titin has been difficult to
sequence and study due to its size, large number of isoforms, and
unsolved tertiary structure. All of the individual variants present in
this cohort occurred with a frequency of less than 0.5% in the 1000
Genomes Project, suggesting that a proportion of them might be, at the
very least, modulators of the phenotype. However, the overall frequency
of variants in the CMH cohort was actually lower than that seen in the
control exome population. Lopes et al. (2013) concluded that further
work on understanding the role of titin in CMH was necessary.

- Muscular Dystrophy

Tibial muscular dystrophy (TMD; 600334) is an autosomal dominant
late-onset distal myopathy characterized by weakness and atrophy usually
confined to the anterior compartment of the lower leg. Cardiomyopathy
has not been diagnosed in patients with TMD. In 81 Finnish patients with
TMD from 12 unrelated families, Hackman et al. (2002) identified an
11-bp deletion (188840.0004) in Mex6, the last exon (exon 363) of the
TTN gene. Mex6 encodes an Ig domain that, in situ, is localized at the
periphery of the M line lattice. Mex6 and Mex5 are in the region
determining the calpain-3 binding site of M line titin. Three patients
with a more severe phenotype, limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2J
(LGMD2J; 608807), were homozygous for the 11-bp deletion. In a French
family with TMD, a leu34315-to-pro mutation in Mex6 (188840.0005) was
discovered.

Lange et al. (2005) found a mutation in the titin protein kinase domain
that results in Edstrom myopathy (603689).

Carmignac et al. (2007) identified 2 different homozygous deletions in
the TTN gene (188840.0012; 188840.0013, respectively) in affected
members of 2 unrelated families with early-onset myopathy and fatal
cardiomyopathy (611705). The deletions occurred in Mex1 and Mex3,
truncating the C-terminal region of the protein; the kinase portion was
preserved.

ANIMAL MODEL

The zebrafish embryo is transparent and can tolerate absence of blood
flow because its oxygen is delivered by diffusion rather than by the
cardiovascular system. It is, therefore, possible to attribute cardiac
failure directly to particular genes by ruling out the possibility that
it is due to a secondary effect of hypoxia. Xu et al. (2002) studied a
recessive lethal mutation, called 'pickwick' (pik), discovered in a
large-scale genetic screen. The heart of the pik mutant develops
normally but is poorly contractile from the first beat. Aside from the
edema that inevitably accompanies cardiac dysfunction, development is
normal during the first 3 days. Xu et al. (2002) showed by positional
cloning that the 'causative' mutation is in an alternatively spliced
exon of the titin gene. Titin is the biggest known protein and spans the
half-sarcomere from the Z disc to M line in heart and skeletal muscle.
It appears to provide a scaffold for the assembly of thick and thin
filaments and to provide elastic recoil engendered by stretch during
diastole. Xu et al. (2002) found that nascent myofibrils form in pik
mutants, but normal sarcomeres are absent. Mutant cells transplanted to
wildtype hearts remained thin and bulged outwards as individual cell
aneurysms without affecting nearby wildtype cardiomyocytes, indicating
that the contractile deficiency is cell-autonomous. Absence of titin
function thus results in blockage of sarcomere assembly and causes a
functional disorder resembling human dilated cardiomyopathies, one form
of which was shown to be caused in the human by mutations in the TTN
gene (Gerull et al., 2002).

Muscular dystrophy with myositis (mdm) is a recessive mouse mutation
that causes severe and progressive muscular degeneration. Garvey et al.
(2002) identified the mdm mutation as a complex rearrangement that
includes a deletion and LINE insertion in the titin gene. Mutant
allele-specific splicing results in the deletion of 83 amino acids from
the N2A region of TTN, a domain thought to bind CAPN3. Western blot
analysis detected a 50 to 60% reduction in the amount of CAPN3 in
affected muscles. Garvey et al. (2002) concluded that the mdm mouse is a
model for tibial muscular dystrophy.

The giant protein titin serves a primary role as a scaffold for
sarcomere assembly; one potential mediator of this process is calpain-3
(CAPN3; 114240). To test the hypothesis that calpain-3 mediates
remodeling during myofibrillogenesis, Kramerova et al. (2004) generated
CAPN3 knockout (C3KO) mice. The mice were atrophic, with small foci of
muscular necrosis. Myogenic cells fused normally in vitro, but lacked
well-organized sarcomeres, as visualized by electron microscopy. Titin
distribution was normal in longitudinal sections from the C3KO mice;
however, electron microscopy of muscle fibers showed misaligned A bands.
In vitro studies revealed that calpain-3 can bind and cleave titin and
that some mutations that are pathogenic in human muscular dystrophy
result in reduced affinity of calpain-3 for titin. The authors suggested
a role for calpain-3 in myofibrillogenesis and sarcomere remodeling.

Huebsch et al. (2005) generated CAPN3 overexpressing transgenic (C3Tg)
and C3KO mice and showed that overexpression of CAPN3 exacerbated mdm
disease, leading to a shorter life span and more severe muscular
dystrophy. However, C3KO/mdm double-mutant mice showed no change in the
progression or severity of disease, indicating that aberrant CAPN3
activity is not a primary mechanism in this disease. The authors
examined the treadmill locomotion of heterozygous +/mdm mice and
detected a significant increase in stride time with a concomitant
increase in stance time. These altered gait parameters were completely
corrected by CAPN3 overexpression in C3Tg/+/mdm mice, suggesting a
CAPN3-dependent role for the N2A domain of TTN in the dynamics of muscle
contraction.

The N2B region of cardiac titin is thought to modulate elasticity of the
titin filament and may be important for hypertrophy signaling and
ischemic stress response through its binding to FHL2 (602633) and
alpha-B crystallin (CRYAB; 123590), respectively. Radke et al. (2007)
deleted the N2B-encoding exon 49 of the titin gene in mice, leaving the
remainder of the gene intact. Mutant mice survived to adulthood and were
fertile. Although mutant hearts were small, they produced normal
ejection volumes because of an increased ejection fraction. Mutant mice
has significantly reduced Fhl2 protein levels, consistent with the
reduced size of mutant hearts. Ultrastructural analysis revealed
increased extension of the remaining spring elements of titin (tandem Ig
segments and the PEVK region), resulting in reduced sarcomere length and
increased passive tension in skinned cardiomyocytes and diastolic
dysfunction. Radke et al. (2007) concluded that the titin N2B region is
dispensable for cardiac development and systolic properties, but it is
important to integrate trophic and elastic functions of the heart.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CARDIOMYOPATHY, FAMILIAL HYPERTROPHIC, 9
TTN, ARG740LEU

In a patient with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (CMH9; 613765) and no
mutations in any of the 8 genes associated with this disorder, Satoh et
al. (1999) identified a heterozygous 740G-T transversion in the TTN
gene, resulting in an arg740-to-leu (R740L) substitution. The parents
were deceased, and the few relatives available were unaffected.
Functional expression studies showed that the mutation resulted in
increased titin binding affinity for alpha-actinin (102575). See
188840.0007 for a nearby mutation (A743V) that causes decreased titin
binding affinity to alpha-actinin, resulting in dilated cardiomyopathy
(604145).

CARDIOMYOPATHY, DILATED, 1G
TTN, 2-BP INS, 43628AT

In a large family with autosomal dominant dilated cardiomyopathy and
linkage to 2q31 (604145), Gerull et al. (2002) found a 2-bp insertion
mutation (43628AT) in exon 326 of the TTN gene, causing a frameshift
that truncated A band titin. The premature stop codon occurred after the
addition of 4 novel amino acid residues. Puzzling was the absence of any
clinically detectable phenotype in skeletal muscle. The 2 exons found to
be affected in dilated cardiomyopathy by Gerull et al. (2002), namely
exons 18 and 326, are both expressed in cardiac and noncardiac muscle
isoforms. The truncated protein of approximately 2 mD was expressed in
skeletal muscle, but Western blot studies with epitope-specific
anti-titin antibodies suggested that the mutant protein was truncated to
a 1.14-mD subfragment by site-specific cleavage. Clinical
characteristics were described by Siu et al. (1999).

In a large family with autosomal dominant dilated cardiomyopathy mapping
to 2q31 (Siu et al., 1999; CMD1G, 604145), Gerull et al. (2002) found a
TTN missense mutation, trp930-to-arg (W930R), predicted to disrupt a
highly conserved hydrophobic core sequence of an immunoglobulin fold
located in the Z disc/I band transition zone. In this kindred, reduced
penetrance of the mutation was observed, as was the case also in the
family with the 2-bp insertion mutation (188840.0002).

TIBIAL MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, TARDIVE
MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, LIMB-GIRDLE, TYPE 2J, INCLUDED
TTN, 11-BP DEL/INS

In 81 Finnish patients with TMD (600334) from 12 unrelated families,
Hackman et al. (2002) found a heterozygous 11-bp deletion/insertion
mutation located at position 293269-293279 in the TTN sequence. The
mutation changed 4 amino acids close to the C-terminal end of the titin
protein but did not cause a frameshift or a stop codon. Each of the 4
amino acids was changed to an amino acid of another charge, and the
overall charge was changed from acidic to basic. The mutation was not
found in 216 Finnish control samples.

In 3 patients with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2J (608807) from
a large consanguineous Finnish family, Hackman et al. (2002) identified
homozygosity for the TTN 11-bp deletion. Other members in the same
family who were heterozygous for the 11-bp deletion manifested the less
severe TMD phenotype.

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Sarparanta et al. (2010) found that titin
containing this mutation failed to interact with myospryn (CMYA5;
612193).

.0005
TIBIAL MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, TARDIVE
TTN, LEU34315PRO

In a French family in which TMD (600334) was shown to be linked to 2q31,
Hackman et al. (2002) identified a 293357T-C transition in the TTN
sequence, resulting in a leu34315-to-pro change in the last exon.

.0006
TIBIAL MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, TARDIVE
TTN, 293329T-A

In affected members of a Belgian family with tibial muscular dystrophy
(600334), Van den Bergh et al. (2003) identified a heterozygous
293329T-A change in the Mex6 exon of the TTN gene, resulting in an
ile-to-asn substitution. The family showed incomplete disease
penetrance.

.0007
CARDIOMYOPATHY, DILATED, 1G
TTN, ALA743VAL

In a father and daughter with dilated cardiomyopathy (604145),
Itoh-Satoh et al. (2002) identified a heterozygous C-to-T transition in
the TTN gene, resulting in an ala743-to-val (A743V) substitution. Both
patients had a history of cardiac arrhythmias (premature atrial or
ventricular contraction and atrioventricular conduction block) before
they developed dilated cardiomyopathy or congestive heart failure. The
A743V mutation is located in the alpha-actinin (102575)-binding domain
of titin, and functional studies showed that the mutation decreased the
affinity of titin Z-repeats to alpha-actinin by about 40% compared to
normal. The authors noted that the A743V mutation is located near the
R740L (188840.0001) mutation, which was found in a patient with
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and results in increased titin-binding
affinity to alpha-actinin.

.0008
CARDIOMYOPATHY, DILATED, 1G
TTN, VAL54MET

In a 19-year-old woman with dilated cardiomyopathy (604145) whose father
had died from the same disorder, Itoh-Satoh et al. (2002) identified a
heterozygous G-to-A transition in the TTN gene, resulting in a
val54-to-met (V54M) substitution at a well-conserved residue in the Z1
domain. The V54M mutation is located in the telethonin (604488)-binding
domain of titin, and functional studies showed that the V54M mutation
decreased the affinity of titin for telethonin to about 60% of normal.

.0009
CARDIOMYOPATHY, DILATED, 1G
TTN, GLN4053TER

In a 45-year-old man with severe heart failure and cardiac dilatation
(604145) without signs of muscle disease, Itoh-Satoh et al. (2002)
identified a heterozygous C-to-T transition in the TTN gene, resulting
in a gln4053-to-ter (Q4053X) nonsense mutation. The mutation occurred in
the N2-B domain of the titin protein, which is known to be expressed
only in cardiac muscle.

.0010
CARDIOMYOPATHY, DILATED, 1G
TTN, SER4465ASN

In a 51-year-old man with dilated cardiomyopathy (604145), Itoh-Satoh et
al. (2002) identified a heterozygous G-to-A transition in the TTN gene,
resulting in a ser4465-to-asn (S4465N) substitution. The mutation
occurred in the N2-B domain of the titin protein, which is known to be
expressed only in cardiac muscle.

.0011
HEREDITARY MYOPATHY WITH EARLY RESPIRATORY FAILURE
TTN, ARG279TRP

In 2 large unrelated Swedish families described by Nicolao et al. (1999)
segregating Edstrom myopathy as an autosomal dominant, also known as
hereditary myopathy with early respiratory failure (HMERF; 603689),
Lange et al. (2005) identified a C-to-T transition in the TTN gene
resulting in an arg-to-trp substitution at codon 279 (R279W) in the
alpha-R1 region of the protein kinase regulatory tail of titin. This
mutation showed complete segregation with the disease in the 2 families.
The mutation was not reported in single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
databases and was not found in 200 normal Swedish controls. An
additional Swedish patient with an identical phenotype but without known
genealogic relation to anyone in the 2 original families was found to
have the same mutation on the same haplotype, indicating a common
ancestry. The R279W mutant protein kinase domain (TK) showed no
difference in calmodulin (114180)-stimulated catalytic activity when
compared with wildtype TK. However, the interaction of TK with NBR1
(166945) was dramatically reduced. In patient biopsies, NBR1 was
localized abnormally diffusely in diseased muscle instead of being M
band- and Z disc-associated, although in HMERF 50% of TK was expected to
be wildtype. This suggested a dominant-negative mechanism of action for
this mutation.

.0012
MYOPATHY, EARLY-ONSET, WITH FATAL CARDIOMYOPATHY
TTN, 1-BP DEL, 291394A

In 3 sibs with early-onset myopathy with fatal cardiomyopathy (611705),
born of consanguineous Moroccan parents, Carmignac et al. (2007)
analyzed genomic DNA and identified a homozygous 1-bp deletion
(291394delA) in exon 380 (Mex3) of the TTN gene, resulting in the loss
of 447 C-terminal residues and disruption of the sarcomeric M line
protein complex. Absence of this part of titin had been expected to be
lethal. The heterozygous parents were clinically unaffected. (The
original article erroneously labeled the mutation 291297delA.)

.0013
MYOPATHY, EARLY-ONSET, WITH FATAL CARDIOMYOPATHY
TTN, 8-BP DEL, NT289385

In 2 sibs, born of consanguineous Sudanese parents, with early-onset
myopathy with fatal cardiomyopathy (611705), Carmignac et al. (2007)
analyzed genomic DNA and identified a homozygous 8-bp deletion
(289385delACCAAGTG) in exon 358 (Mex1) of the TTN gene, resulting in the
loss of 808 C-terminal residues and disruption of the sarcomeric M line
protein complex. Absence of this part of titin had been expected to be
lethal. The heterozygous parents were clinically unaffected.

611289	TITLE *611289 LEUCINE-RICH ALPHA-2-GLYCOPROTEIN 1; LRG1
;;LRG
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The leucine-rich repeat (LRR) family of proteins, including LRG1, have
been shown to be involved in protein-protein interaction, signal
transduction, and cell adhesion and development. LRG1 is expressed
during granulocyte differentiation (O'Donnell et al., 2002).

CLONING

Human LRG1 was isolated from human serum by Haupt and Baudner, 1977. By
sequence analysis, Takahashi et al. (1985) determined that purified LRG1
protein has 312 amino acids and an experimentally determined molecular
mass of 45 kD. The LRG1 polypeptide contains 1 galactosamine and 4
glucosamine oligosaccharides attached and has 2 intrachain disulfide
bonds. Leucine comprises 66 of the 312 amino acids, and LRG1 contains at
least 8 24-amino acid leucine-rich repeats.

Using cDNA representational difference analysis (RDA) to identify genes
induced during neutrophilic differentiation of GCSF (CSF3;
138970)-responsive murine myeloid precursor 32DCL3G cells, followed by
database analysis, O'Donnell et al. (2002) identified mouse and human
LRG1. The deduced 347-amino acid human protein shares 66% amino acid
identity with its mouse homolog. LRG1 contains a predicted N-terminal
signal peptide, and the mature peptide is identical to the sequence
identified by Takahashi et al. (1985). Northern blot analysis of adult
mouse tissues detected high Lrg1 expression in liver, much lower levels
in heart, and barely detectable expression in lung and spleen. Lrg1 was
not detected in brain, skeletal muscle, kidney, or testis. Using human
bone marrow and peripheral blood samples, O'Donnell et al. (2002)
detected LRG1 expression in the neutrophil fraction of both bone marrow
and peripheral blood and in the bone marrow mononuclear cell fraction.

GENE FUNCTION

By Northern blot analysis of mouse Lrg1 expression during GCSF-induced
granulocytic differentiation of 32DCL3G cells, O'Donnell et al. (2002)
observed expression as early as 16 hours after GCSF induction, with
expression reaching an 80-fold increase in 5 days. Comparison of the
time course of Lrg1 induction to that of other genes upregulated during
neutrophilic granulocyte differentiation suggested that Lrg1 expression
is an early event in the process. DMSO-induced granulocytic
differentiation of human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells was
associated with upregulation of LRG1 expression. Increased LRG1
expression was also detected in GCSF-treated human cells derived from a
patient with myeloproliferative disorder. In contrast, decreased LRG1
expression was detected after PMA treatment and induction of monocytic
differentiation of HL-60 cells.

Wang et al. (2013) identified upregulation of Lrg1 in the transcriptome
of retinal microvessels isolated from mouse models of retinal disease
that exhibit vascular pathology. The authors showed that in the presence
of transforming growth factor-beta-1 (TGFB1; 190180), Lrg1 is mitogenic
to endothelial cells and promotes angiogenesis. Mice lacking Lrg1
developed a mild retinal vascular phenotype but exhibited a significant
reduction in pathologic ocular angiogenesis. Lrg1 bound directly to the
Tgf-beta accessory receptor endoglin (131195), which, in the presence of
TGF-beta-1, resulted in promotion of the proangiogenic Smad1/5/8
signaling pathway (see 603295). Lrg1 antibody blockade inhibited this
switch and attenuated angiogenesis. Wang et al. (2013) concluded that
these studies revealed that LRG1 is a regulator of angiogenesis that
mediates its effect by modulating TGF-beta signaling.

GENE STRUCTURE

O'Donnell et al. (2002) determined that the LRG1 gene contains 2 exons.

MAPPING

By database analysis, O'Donnell et al. (2002) mapped the LRG1 gene to
chromosome 19p13.3. They mapped the mouse Lrg1 gene to chromosome 11.

601398	TITLE *601398 VASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH FACTOR B; VEGFB
;;VASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH FACTOR-RELATED FACTOR; VRF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Vascular endothelial growth factor B (VEGFB) signals via the endothelial
receptor VEGFR1 (165070) and is a regulator of blood vessel physiology,
with a role in endothelial targeting of lipids to peripheral tissues
(summary by Hagberg et al., 2010).

CLONING

Grimmond et al. (1996) cloned and characterized a member of the vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF; 192240) gene family, which they
designated VRF for VEGF-related factor. By sequencing of cDNAs from a
human fetal brain library and RT-PCR products from normal and tumor
tissue cDNA pools, they identified 2 alternatively spliced messages with
open reading frames of 621 and 564 bp, respectively. The predicted 186-
and 167-amino acid polypeptides differ at their carboxyl ends, resulting
from a shift in the open reading frame. Both isoforms show strong
homology to VEGF at their amino termini, but only the shorter isoform
maintained homology to VEGF at its carboxyl terminus and conserved all
16 cysteine residues of the 165-amino acid form of VEGF. VRF was
predicted to contain a signal peptide, suggesting to Grimmond et al.
(1996) that it may be a secreted factor. The investigators found that
VRF is ubiquitously expressed as 2 transcripts of 2.0 and 5.5 kb and
that the level of expression is similar among normal and malignant
tissues.

Olofsson et al. (1996) showed that mouse and human VEGFB-167 share 88%
sequence identity. By Northern blot analysis of human tissues, they
identified a 1.4-kb VEGFB-167 transcript expressed in heart, skeletal
muscle, pancreas, and prostate.

Olofsson et al. (1996) showed that the C termini of VEGFB-167, VEGF, and
other related growth factors contain a strongly basic cysteine-rich
heparin binding domain, whereas the C terminus of VEGFB-186 has no
heparin binding domain, is less basic and more hydrophobic, and has no
similarity to any published sequence. Olofsson et al. (1996) performed
Northern blot analysis using a probe specific to VEGFB-186 and found a
1.4-kb transcript expressed in a pattern nearly identical to that
described by Olofsson et al. (1996) for VEGFB-167.

GENE STRUCTURE

Grimmond et al. (1996) found that the protein coding region of VRF,
which spans approximately 5 kb, is composed of 8 exons that range in
size from 36 to 431 bp. Exons 6 and 7 are contiguous and the 2 isoforms
of VRF arise through alternate splicing of exon 6.

GENE FUNCTION

In a large panel of tumors of endocrine and nonendocrine origin,
Grimmond et al. (1996) observed a reduction in expression of VRF only in
those endocrine tumors known to be hemizygous for 11q. The authors
pointed out that the putative role of VRF as a growth factor makes it an
unlikely candidate for the MEN1 tumor suppressor gene.

Olofsson et al. (1996) noted that VEGF and VEGFB-167 are coexpressed in
many tissues. In situ hybridization revealed that VEGFB-167 is expressed
predominantly in muscular tissues and that expression can be detected at
an early stage during embryonic development. Expression of VEGF and
VEGFB-167 in transfected human embryonic 293EBNA cells and subsequent
analysis by SDS/PAGE showed that VEGFB-167 forms cell-associated
disulfide-linked dimers and can form heterodimers with VEGF. Olofsson et
al. (1996) demonstrated that VEGFB-167 can act as an endothelial cell
growth factor.

Olofsson et al. (1996) reported the expression of VEGF and VEGFB-186 in
transfected human embryonic 293EBNA cells; subsequent analysis by
SDS/PAGE revealed that VEGFB-186 is secreted as a disulfide-linked
homodimer and that, like VEGFB-167, this isoform can form
disulfide-linked heterodimers with VEGF. Expression experiments using
COS cells and digestion with neuraminidase also revealed that VEGFB-186
undergoes O-linked glycosylation during its intracellular transport and
secretion.

Silvestre et al. (2003) analyzed the angiogenic effect of VEGFB in 2
different models of angiogenesis: an in vivo model of Matrigel and a
mouse model of surgically induced hindlimb ischemia. They demonstrated
that VEGFB, in part through its receptor VEGFR1 (165070), promotes
angiogenesis in association with activation of AKT (164730) and
endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS; 163729)-related pathways.

Hagberg et al. (2010) showed that VEGFB has a role in endothelial
targeting of lipids to peripheral tissues. Dietary lipids present in
circulation must be transported through the vascular endothelium to be
metabolized by tissue cells. Bioinformatic analysis showed that Vegfb
was tightly coexpressed with nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes across
a large variety of physiologic conditions in mice, pointing to a role
for VEGFB in metabolism. VEGFB specifically controlled endothelial
uptake of fatty acids via transcriptional regulation of vascular fatty
acid transport proteins. As a consequence, Vegfb -/- mice showed less
uptake and accumulation of lipids in muscle, heart, and brown adipose
tissue, and instead shunted lipids to white adipose tissue. This
regulation was mediated by VEGFR1 and neuropilin-1 (NRP1; 602069)
expressed by the endothelium. The coexpression of VEGFB and
mitochondrial proteins introduces a novel regulatory mechanism, whereby
endothelial lipid uptake and mitochondrial lipid use are tightly
coordinated.

MAPPING

Grimmond et al. (1996) showed that the VRF gene is located within a
cosmid (the D11S750 locus) which maps to 11q13 in the region of multiple
endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1; 131100). PCR-based mapping against a
human/hamster hybrid panel confirmed single gene copy number and
localization to 11q13.

By FISH, Gerace et al. (2001) mapped the Vegfb gene to mouse chromosome
19B.

ANIMAL MODEL

Bellomo et al. (2000) described the Vegfb -/- mouse. Unlike Vegfa -/-
mice, which die during embryogenesis, Vegfb -/- mice are healthy and
fertile. Although Vegfb -/- hearts appeared morphologically and
functionally normal in unstressed mice, Bellomo et al. (2000) found that
Vegfb -/- hearts were marginally smaller and displayed vascular
dysfunction after coronary occlusion and impaired recovery from
experimentally induced myocardial ischemia.

Mould et al. (2003) studied 2 mouse models of arthritis, antigen- and
collagen-induced arthritis, in Vegfb knockout mice. Knee joint swelling,
synovial inflammation, and inflammation-associated vessel density in
arthritic joints were reduced in Vegfb -/- mice compared to wildtype
mice. Mould et al. (2003) concluded that the reduction in
inflammation-associated synovial angiogenesis in Vegfb -/- mice
implicated VEGFB in pathologic vascular remodeling in inflammatory
arthritis.

Hagberg et al. (2012) showed that decreased Vegfb signaling in rodent
models of type 2 diabetes (see 125853) restores insulin sensitivity and
improves glucose tolerance. Genetic deletion of Vegfb in diabetic db/db
(leptin receptor-null; see 601007) mice prevented ectopic lipid
deposition, increased muscle glucose uptake, and maintained
normoglycemia. Pharmacologic inhibition of Vegfb signaling by antibody
administration to db/db mice enhanced glucose tolerance, preserved
pancreatic islet architecture, improved B-cell function, and ameliorated
dyslipidemia, key elements of type 2 diabetes and the metabolic
syndrome. The potential use of VEGFB neutralization in type 2 diabetes
was further elucidated in rats fed a high-fat diet, in which it
normalized insulin sensitivity and increased glucose uptake in skeletal
muscle and heart. Hagberg et al. (2012) concluded that the vascular
endothelium can function as an efficient barrier to excess muscle lipid
uptake even under conditions of severe obesity and type 2 diabetes, and
that this barrier can be maintained by inhibition of VEGFB signaling.
