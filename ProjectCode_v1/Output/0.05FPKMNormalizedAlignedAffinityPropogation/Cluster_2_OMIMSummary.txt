605416	TITLE *605416 DICKKOPF, XENOPUS, HOMOLOG OF, 3; DKK3
DESCRIPTION For background information on WNT and Dickkopf proteins, see WNT6
(604663) and DKK1 (605189).

CLONING

By searching EST databases with a partial DKK3 sequence, followed by
probing a fetal brain cDNA library, Krupnik et al. (1999) isolated a
cDNA encoding DKK3. The deduced 350-amino acid DKK3 protein, like DKK1,
DKK2 (605415), and DKK4 (605417), possesses an N-terminal signal peptide
and 2 conserved cysteine-rich domains, which are separated by a linker
region and contain 10 cys residues each. The second cys region has a
putative lipid-binding function that may facilitate WNT/DKK interactions
at the plasma membrane. The linker region contains 50 to 55 amino acids
in DKK1, DKK2, and DKK4, whereas in DKK3 it contains only 12 amino
acids. DKK3 has 4 potential N-glycosylation sites and possesses an
extended N-terminal domain preceding the first cys domain as well as an
extended C-terminal region following the second cys domain. All DKKs
have several potential sites for cleavage by furin-type proteases.
Northern blot analysis revealed wide expression of a 2.5-kb DKK3
transcript, with highest expression in heart, brain, and spinal cord. In
situ hybridization analysis demonstrated highest expression of Dkk3 in
mouse brain, eye, and heart. Western blot analysis showed that DKK3 is
secreted as a heterogeneous 45- to 65-kD protein; deglycosylation
reduced the protein to 40- and 45- to 55-kD proteins. Functional
analysis determined that DKK3 does not block Xenopus Wnt8 induction of a
secondary axis in frog embryos.

612257	TITLE *612257 MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED SERINE/THREONINE KINASE 2; MAST2
;;MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED SERINE/THREONINE KINASE, 205-KD; MAST205;;
KIAA0807
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned MAST2, which they designated
KIAA0807. The deduced 1,265-amino acid protein shares significant
similarity with mouse Mast205. RT-PCR ELISA detected variable MAST2
expression in all tissues examined.

Walden and Cowan (1993) cloned mouse Mast205 from a testis cDNA library.
The deduced 1,734-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of
190.5 kD. It had an apparent molecular mass of 205 kD by SDS-PAGE.
Mast205 contains a central serine/threonine kinase catalytic domain,
which includes an ATP-binding consensus sequence, and several potential
phosphorylation sites. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues detected
Mast205 expression only in testis. Mast205 expression increased during
postnatal testicular development coincident with meiosis/spermiogenesis.
Immunofluorescence microscopy showed Mast205 associated with mouse
spermatid manchette.

GENE FUNCTION

Walden and Cowan (1993) confirmed that mouse Mast205 had
serine/threonine kinase activity, but not tyrosine kinase activity.
Mouse Mast205 associated with bovine microtubules in vitro. Mutation
analysis revealed that the kinase domain and a more C-terminal domain of
Mast205 were required interaction with microtubules; however, the
interaction was indirect and required other microtubule-associated
proteins.

Valiente et al. (2005) showed that the C-terminal tail of human PTEN
(601728) bound to the PDZ domains of rat Magi2 (606382), Magi3, and Dlg
(DLG1; 601014), mouse Sast (MAST1; 612256) and Mast205, and human MAST3
(612258). Interaction of PTEN with Magi2 increased PTEN protein
stability, and interaction of PTEN with the MAST kinases facilitated
phosphorylation of PTEN by these kinases.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the MAST1 gene
to chromosome 1.

604602	TITLE *604602 RIBOSOME-RECYCLING FACTOR, MITOCHONDRIAL; MRRF
;;RRF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The termination of protein synthesis requires the action of several
auxiliary factors. In bacteria, ribosome-recycling factor (Rrf) is
essential for the release of ribosomes from the mRNA at the stop codon.
Mitochondria perform protein synthesis using a translation system that
has some features reminiscent of prokaryotic translation and other
features that are unique. By searching an EST database using the E. coli
Rrf protein sequence as the query, Zhang and Spremulli (1998) identified
human ESTs encoding mitochondrial ribosome-recycling factor (MRRF). They
assembled the complete MRRF coding sequence using ESTs. Sequence
analysis of the deduced 263-amino acid MRRF protein indicated that it is
likely localized in the mitochondria; however, MRRF does not have a
clear cleavage signal for removal of the signal peptide. Human MRRF
shares approximately 25 to 30% amino acid sequence identity with
bacterial RRFs.

GENE FUNCTION

Using in vitro assays with recombinant human proteins, Tsuboi et al.
(2009) showed that RRF interacted directly with EFG2 (GFM2; 606544) and
that both were required for ribosome dissociation from mRNA. GTP, but
not GTP hydrolysis, was also required. GTP hydrolysis by EFG2 appeared
to follow the ribosome splitting reaction and occurred on the ribosomal
large subunit. EFG2 and RRF remained on the large subunit until GTP was
hydrolyzed and prevented reassociation of subunits.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Hansen et al. (2000) assigned the MRRF
gene to chromosome 9q32-q34.1.

;;LIFEGUARD; LFG;;
NEUROMEMBRANE PROTEIN 35; NMP35
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is used in a number of biologic
processes from modeling the embryo and regulating the immune system to
tumor regression. Conversely, dysfunction of this system has been
implicated in oncogenesis, development of autoimmunity, and degenerative
diseases. Intense study of this process identified membrane-bound
receptors and their cognate ligands that together begin the program that
ultimately leads to cell death. The FAS receptor, also called CD95 or
Apo1, is one such receptor, of which the gene is designated TNFRSF6
(134637) to indicate that it is a member of the tumor necrosis factor
(TNF) receptor superfamily. The apoptotic signal must itself be tightly
controlled to avoid inappropriate cell death. Somia et al. (1999)
established a genetic screen to search for molecules that inhibit the
apoptotic signal from the FAS receptor. They isolated a gene, called LFG
('lifeguard'), and found that it is the human homolog of a rat protein,
neuromembrane protein-35 (NMP35), described by Schweitzer et al. (1998).
The LFG open reading frame encodes a 316-amino acid protein predicted by
hydropathy plots to contain 7 membrane-spanning domains. They found that
LFG protects cells uniquely from FAS but not from the mechanistically
related tumor necrosis factor-alpha (191160) death signal. LFG is widely
distributed, but remarkably is highly expressed in the hippocampus. LFG
can bind to the FAS receptor, but does not regulate FAS expression or
interfere with binding of an agonist antibody. Furthermore, LFG does not
inhibit binding of FADD (602457) to FAS.

MAPPING

Somia et al. (1999) used a human/rodent somatic hybrid panel to map the
LFG gene to chromosome 12. This localization was confirmed by
fluorescence in situ hybridization, with a subchromosomal location of
12q13.

608402	TITLE *608402 MEMBRANE-SPANNING 4-DOMAINS, SUBFAMILY A, MEMBER 6E; MS4A6E
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Most MS4A genes encode proteins with at least 4 potential transmembrane
domains and N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic domains encoded by distinct
exons. The exception is MS4A6E, which encodes a protein with only 2
transmembrane domains and no C-terminal cytoplasmic domain.

CLONING

By searching for additional genes in the MS4A complex on chromosome
11q12-q13, Liang et al. (2001) identified MS4A4E (608401), MS4A10
(608403), and MS4A6E. The putative MS4A6E gene encodes a 147-amino acid
protein that is 78% identical to MS4A6A (606548), with high homology in
the hydrophobic regions and the intracellular N-terminal domain. MS4A6E
lacks a C-terminal intracellular domain. RT-PCR analysis failed to
detect MS4A6E transcripts in any tissues or hemopoietic cell lines
tested. EST database searching identified sequences from pooled fetal
organ libraries. Liang et al. (2001) proposed that expression may occur
primarily during oncogenesis or embryogenesis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Liang et al. (2001) determined that the MS4A6E gene contains at least 4
exons and spans more than 5 kb. It lacks the exons encoding the first 2
transmembrane domains found in most MS4A genes.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Liang et al. (2001) mapped the MS4A6E gene
to chromosome 11q12-q13.1, between the MS4A4A (606547) and MS4A7
(606502) genes.

179514	TITLE *179514 RAS-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN RAB5B; RAB5B
DESCRIPTION A number of processes in eukaryotic cells are believed to be regulated
by small, monomeric GTPases belonging to the RAS superfamily. A subset
of these GTPases (the yeast YPTI/SEC4 gene products and their mammalian
counterparts, the RAB proteins) plays a central role in membrane
trafficking. Each of the several proteins of this subfamily that have
been identified is thought to regulate vesicular trafficking at a
specific subcellular compartment. The subcellular location of several
RAB proteins has been determined by immunohistochemical methods. For
example, RAB2 (179509) is found in the intermediate recycling pathway
between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex. RAB6 (179513)
is distributed in the medial and trans Golgi. RAB4 (179511) and RAB5A
(179512) are associated with the plasma membrane and early endosomes.
Wilson and Wilson (1992) cloned cDNA of a novel member of the RAB family
by screening a human umbilical vein endothelial cell cDNA library with
oligonucleotide probes corresponding to a region conserved in all RAB
proteins. The newly identified RAB protein was 81% identical to human
RAB5, the canine counterpart of which had been localized to the plasma
membrane and early endosomes. In light of this homology, Wilson and
Wilson (1992) called the new member of the GTPase superfamily RAB5B. It
is presumably involved in vesicular trafficking at the plasma membrane.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Korenberg et al. (1995) mapped
the RAB5B gene to 12q13.

;;REQUIEM, APOPTOSIS RESPONSE ZINC FINGER GENE; REQ;;
UBI-D4/REQUIEM HOMOLOG; UBID4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chestkov et al. (1996) described a conserved human gene homologous to
Neuro-d4 (DPF1; 601670) that they designated Ubi-d4. The human protein
is the apparent homolog of the mouse Ubi-d4 protein, also known as
Requiem (Gabig et al., 1994).

Apoptosis in murine myeloid cell lines requires expression of the
Requiem gene, which encodes a putative zinc finger protein. A large
consortium (Gabig et al., 1998) consisting of 3 groups detected the
protein in both cytoplasmic and nuclear subcellular fractions of murine
myeloid cells and human K562 leukemia cells, suggesting that the protein
may have a function distinct from that of a transcription factor. The
distribution did not alter upon apoptosis induction by IL3 deprivation.
The gene was expressed in various tissues in early gestational ages;
however, expression was confined to testis, spleen, thymus, and part of
the hippocampus in the adult mouse. The expression profile was
considered consistent with a functional role during rapid growth and
cell turnover, and again suggested a regulatory function for
hematopoietic cells. The nucleotide sequence of the human cDNA is 73%
identical overall to that of the murine cDNA. The human sequence encodes
a 391-amino acid protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Expression of Ubi-d4/requiem appeared to be required for apoptosis
(Chestkov et al., 1996; Gabig et al., 1994).

MAPPING

Chestkov et al. (1996) mapped the DPF2 gene to chromosome 11q13 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

By cohybridization fluorescence in situ hybridization on extended DNA
fibers, Gabig et al. (1998) mapped the REQ gene between MLK3 (600050)
and FAU (134690), which had been mapped to 11q13, telomeric to PYGM
(608455). The physical distance between MLK3 and REQ was estimated to be
150 kb.

610366	TITLE *610366 ADAPTOR-RELATED PROTEIN COMPLEX 3, MU-1 SUBUNIT; AP3M1
;;CLATHRIN ADAPTOR COMPLEX AP3, MU-3A SUBUNIT
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

AP3M1 is a subunit of the AP3 complex that functions in cargo-selective
transport of proteins from the Golgi to the lysosome. Other subunits of
this complex are beta-3 (see AP3B1; 603401), AP3D1 (607246), and sigma-3
(see AP3S1; 601507) (Odorizzi et al., 1998).

CLONING

Pevsner et al. (1994) cloned rat Ap3m1, which encodes a 47-kD protein
with about 80% amino acid identity to Ap3m2 (610469) and about 30% amino
acid identity to mouse mu-1 (see AP1M1; 603535) and rat mu-2 (AP2M1;
601024). Ap3m1 was expressed in all rat tissues examined, including
brain heart, kidney, liver, lung, muscle, and spinal cord.

GENE FUNCTION

Dell'Angelica et al. (1999) found that the mu-3A subunit of AP3
interacts with tyrosine-based lysosome targeting signals in cargo
proteins and thereby assists in their targeting from the Golgi to
lysosomes.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the AP3M1
gene to chromosome 10 (TMAP WI-11846).

609931	TITLE *609931 MYOSIN LIGHT CHAIN 6, ALKALI, SMOOTH MUSCLE AND NONMUSCLE; MYL6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Myosin is composed of heavy chain (MHC; see 160730) and light chain
(MLC) subunits. Alkaline MLCs, such as MYL6, dissociate from MHCs at
high pH. MYL6 encodes both smooth muscle and nonmuscle MLC isoforms
(Hailstones and Gunning, 1990).

CLONING

By screening a genomic library with a chicken Mlc and a partial clone of
MYL1 (160780), followed by screening lymphoblast and smooth muscle cDNA
libraries, Lenz et al. (1989) cloned 2 MYL6 variants generated by
alternative splicing of exon 6. They designated the nonmuscle variant
LYM4 and the smooth muscle variant GT6. Both deduced proteins contain
151 amino acids and differ at only 5 C-terminal amino acids. The GT6
transcript also has a longer 3-prime UTR. Northern blot analysis
detected a 0.7-kb LYM4 transcript in both HeLa cells and human uterus
smooth muscle, whereas a GT6 transcript of similar size was detected in
uterus smooth muscle only.

By screening a transformed human fibroblast cDNA library with MLC1SA
(609930), followed by RT-PCR of human colon RNA, Hailstones and Gunning
(1990) cloned the nonmuscle and smooth muscle variants of MYL6, which
they designated MLC3NM and MLC3SM, respectively. Both deduced proteins
contain 151 amino acids and differ from other MLCs in that they lack
highly basic amino aids in their N termini. MLC3NM has a calculated
molecular mass of 16.9 kD, whereas MLC3SM has a calculated molecular
mass of 17 kD. Expression of MYL6 was highest in fibroblasts and
myoblasts, lower in fetal muscle, and lowest in adult muscle.

Using glutathione S-transferase-3 (GSTP1; 134660) as probe of a retina
cDNA library, Bora et al. (1994) cloned an MYL6 splice variant that they
designated ESMLC. The deduced 157-amino acid ESMLC protein is identical
to GT6 (Lenz et al., 1989) except that it contains additional N-terminal
amino acids. The nucleotide sequence of GSTP1 and ESMLC are 54%
identical, but the deduced proteins are only 11% identical. PCR analysis
detected ESMLC expression in eye, aorta, and heart.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lenz et al. (1989) determined that the MYL6 gene contains 7 exons. Exon
1 encodes only the first methionine and the 5-prime UTR.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the MYL6
gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP WI-18807).

611806	TITLE *611806 ARSENIC (+3 OXIDATION STATE) METHYLTRANSFERASE; AS3MT
;;S-ADENOSYL-L-METHIONINE:ARSENIC(III) METHYLTRANSFERASE;;
CYT19
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

AS3MT catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from
S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) to trivalent arsenical and may play a
role in arsenic metabolism (Lin et al., 2002).

CLONING

By mass spectrometry of rat As3mt purified from rat liver cytosol,
followed by database analysis, Lin et al. (2002) identified human AS3MT.
By PCR of an adult rat liver cDNA library, they cloned rat As3mt. The
deduced 369-amino acid rat protein has a calculated molecular mass of
about 41 kD and contains 2 methyltransferase motifs. RT-PCR analysis of
adult rat tissues detected expression in heart, adrenal, urinary
bladder, brain, kidney, lung, and liver. Human AS3MT was expressed in a
hepatoma cell line but not in an immortalized human urothelial cell
line. Recombinant rat As3mt catalyzed the transfer of methyl groups from
AdoMet to trivalent arsenicals, resulting in methylated and dimethylated
arsenicals.

By 5-prime and 3-prime RACE PCR of a human liver cDNA library, Wood et
al. (2006) cloned AS3MT, which encodes a 375-amino acid protein with 76%
amino acid identity to rat As3mt.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wood et al. (2006) determined that the AS3MT gene contains 11 exons and
spans 32 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Wood et al. (2006) mapped the AS3MT gene
to chromosome 10q24.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By sequencing the AS3MT gene in 60 African American and 60 Caucasian
American samples, Wood et al. (2006) identified 26 SNPs, including 3
nonsynonymous SNPs and a VNTR in the 5-prime untranslated region. In
transfected COS-1 cells, a met287-to-thr (M287T)-containing allozyme
showed increased enzyme activity compared to wildtype.

Among 207 Chilean men working in the copper industry and exposed to
arsenic, Hernandez et al. (2008) observed an associated between urinary
arsenic metabolite levels and the M287T SNP in the AS3MT gene, The
thr287 variant occurred at a frequency of 0.09. Individuals carrying the
variant allele presented a 4.63% higher level of arsenic metabolites in
urine than carriers of the wildtype allele (p = 0.0007). When the
population was divided into 2 groups according to the level of arsenic
exposure, a significant increase was found only in the higher exposed
group, where individuals carrying the variant allele presented a 4.79%
higher level of urinary MMA compared to wildtype allele carriers (p =
0.0010). Hernandez et al. (2008) concluded that individuals with the
thr287 variant have increased arsenic methylation and thus may be at an
increased risk for the toxic and genotoxic effects of arsenic exposure,
if, as the classical arsenic metabolic pathway indicates, methylation
enhances toxicity.

114110	TITLE *114110 S100 CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEIN A6; S100A6
;;CALCYCLIN; CACY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

S100 proteins, such as S100A6, are small, acidic Ca(2+)-binding proteins
that transduce Ca(2+)-signals via interaction with intracellular target
proteins (Mandinova et al., 1998).

CLONING

Ferrari et al. (1987) noted that S100A6, which they called calcyclin,
was originally defined as a cDNA clone (2A9) whose cognate RNA was found
to be growth-regulated and whose sequence showed strong similarities to
that of the S100 protein (see S100A1; 176940) and to a subunit of the
major cellular substrate for tyrosine kinase.

Using Northern blot analysis, Engelkamp et al. (1992) found ubiquitous
expression of a CACY transcript of about 550 bp. Highest expression was
detected in kidney, lung, and thymus.

Using immunofluorescence analysis and confocal laser scanning
microscopy, Mandinova et al. (1998) showed that S100A1, S100A2 (176993),
S100A4 (114210), and S100A6 localized to distinct intracellular
compartments in cultured human vascular and intestinal smooth muscle
cells. S100A6 localized predominantly with the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

GENE FUNCTION

Mandinova et al. (1998) showed that elevated cytosolic Ca(2+) led to
relocalization of S100A1, S100A4, and S100A6 from sarcoplasmic reticulum
to vesicle-like structures around the nucleus in human vascular smooth
muscle cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Using a full-length cDNA, Ferrari et al. (1987) isolated the entire
calcyclin gene plus extensive flanking sequences. They found that the
calcyclin gene is present in single copy and has 3 exons. The 5-prime
flanking sequence contains a TATA box, GC boxes, and a sequence with a
strong homology to the enhancer core of the SV40 promoter. Other
enhancer-like elements are scattered in both the 5-prime and 3-prime
flanking regions.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, Ferrari et al. (1987) determined that the CACY
gene maps to chromosome 1q21-q25. Using cDNA probes for CACY, van
Heyningen et al. (1989) and Dorin et al. (1990) showed that the CACY
gene cosegregates with CAGA (S100A8; 123885) and CAGB (S100A9; 123886),
which are located on chromosome 1q12-q21. In the course of constructing
a physical map of human 1q21-q23, Oakey et al. (1992) determined that
the CACY gene is located at the centromeric end of that segment,
proximal to SPTA1 (182860).

Schafer et al. (1995) isolated a YAC from chromosome 1q21 on which 9
different genes coding for S100 calcium-binding proteins could be
localized. The clustered organization of S100 genes allowed introduction
of a new logical nomenclature based on their physical arrangement on the
chromosome with S100A1 being closest to the telomere and S100A9 being
closest to the centromere. In the new nomenclature, CACY became S100A6.

By linkage studies of interspecific backcrosses of Mus spretus and Mus
musculus domesticus, Seldin (1989) demonstrated that the Cacy gene is
located on mouse chromosome 3.

171490	TITLE *171490 PHOSDUCIN; PDC
DESCRIPTION Pinealocytes of the pineal gland and photoreceptors of the retina are
embryologically related. In lower vertebrates, the pinealocytes possess
the structure and light sensitivity of retinal photoreceptors; however,
in mammalian pineals, pinealocytes have become shielded from light by
the cranium and have developed an alternative neuroendocrine function
(Reiter, 1981). Rat pinealocytes, like those of other mammals, exhibit
circadian rhythms of activity that are entrained by light through a
circuitous neural pathway, extending from the retina to the hypothalamus
and returning to the pineal via sympathetic nerves of the peripheral
nervous system. The pineal gland contains a soluble phosphoprotein,
phosducin, which is homologous in solubility and primary amino acid
structure to retinal phosducin. Phosducin has been shown to bind the
beta and gamma subunits of the retinal G-protein transducin. Lee et al.
(1990) sequenced the bovine retinal phosducin. Craft et al. (1991) used
the bovine retinal phosducin mRNA to isolate cDNA for this gene from a
rat pineal library. The cDNA was used to map the phosducin gene in the
mouse. By the study of interspecific crosses, Craft et al. (1991) found
that the phosducin gene is located within a region of mouse chromosome 1
that shows homology of synteny with a region of human 1q. Ding et al.
(1993) proved the prediction by homology by mapping the human PDC gene
to chromosome 1 by somatic cell hybridization and by regionalizing the
assignment to 1q25-q31.1 by in situ hybridization. Using both
human/mouse somatic cell hybrids and in situ hybridization to metaphase
chromosomes, Sparkes et al. (1993) mapped the human PDC gene to
chromosome 1q25-q32.1. PDC is a potential candidate gene for retinitis
pigmentosa. Abe et al. (1994) showed that the PDC gene is 18 kb long and
has 4 exons. The sequences of the human and mouse phosducin genes were
highly homologous.

;;OTU DOMAIN-CONTAINING UBAL-BINDING PROTEIN 2;;
OTUBAIN 2; OTU2; OTB2;;
CHROMOSOME 14 OPEN READING FRAME 137; C14ORF137
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Otubains are deubiquitylating cysteine proteases (DUBs; see 602519) that
belong to the ovarian tumor (OTU) protein superfamily. Like other DUBs,
otubains cleave proteins precisely at the ubiquitin (UB; see
191339)-protein bond.

CLONING

By affinity purification of DUBs from HeLa cells using UB aldehyde
(UBAL), followed by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrophotometric analysis,
Balakirev et al. (2003) obtained cDNAs encoding OTB1 (608337) and OTB2.
The 234-amino acid, 27-kD OTB1 protein contains UB-interaction motifs
(UIMs) and UB-associated (UBA) domains, as well as putative nuclear
localization signals and a consensus LxxLL motif. RT-PCR and Western
blot analyses revealed wide expression of OTB2, with highest expression
in brain.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Balakirev et al. (2003) mapped the OTUB2
gene to chromosome 14q32.12.

611202	TITLE *611202 N-ACYLSPHINGOSINE AMIDOHYDROLASE 2; ASAH2
;;CERAMIDASE, NONLYSOSOMAL;;
NONLYSOSOMAL CERAMIDASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ceramidases (EC 3.5.1.23), such as ASAH2, catalyze hydrolysis of the
N-acyl linkage of ceramide, a second messenger in a variety of cellular
events, to produce sphingosine. Sphingosine exerts both mitogenic and
apoptosis-inducing activities, and its phosphorylated form functions as
an intra- and intercellular second messenger (see 603730) (Mitsutake et
al., 2001).

CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to rat brain ceramidase,
followed by PCR and RACE of a kidney cDNA library, El Bawab et al.
(2000) cloned ASAH2, which they called CDase. The deduced 761-amino acid
protein has a calculated molecular mass of 84 kD. It contains a signal
peptide, a mitochondrial targeting sequence, 4 transmembrane domains, a
myristoylation site, phosphorylation sites, and N-glycosylation sites.
Northern blot analysis detected ubiquitous expression of a major 3.5-kb
transcript, with highest levels in kidney, skeletal muscle, and heart.
Minor transcripts of 2.4, 3.1, and 7 kb were expressed in some tissues.
Fluorescence-tagged ASAH2 colocalized with a mitochondrial marker in
transfected human cell lines. Western blot analysis detected
fluorescence-tagged ASAH2 at 123 kD, suggesting that the mass of ASAH2
alone is 96 kD.

Avramopoulos et al. (2007) identified ASAH2L (ASAH2C; 610987), a partial
duplication of the ASAH2 gene inserted downstream from promoter
sequences on chromosome 10. Northern blot analysis using probes common
to both ASAH2 and ASAH2L and specific to ASAH2 suggested that ASAH2 was
expressed in colon only. The major ASAH2 transcript was 5.3 kb, and
minor transcripts of 1.5 and 2.5 kb were also detected. RT-PCR showed
highest ASAH2 expression in colon and small intestine, with weaker
expression in kidney and testis. Avramopoulos et al. (2007) concluded
that the ubiquitously expressed 3.5-kb transcript reported by El Bawab
et al. (2000) corresponded to ASAH2L, not ASAH2.

Mitsutake et al. (2001) cloned rat Asah2, which encodes a protein 76%
identical to human ASAH2. They noted that mouse and rat Asah2 lack the
mitochondrial localization signal found in human ASAH2, but they have an
endoplasmic reticulum transitional signal and a lysosome/late endosome
sorting signal not found in the human protein. The rat protein localized
at apical membranes of rat kidney tubules and was enriched in raft
microdomains with cholesterol and GM1 ganglioside. In rat liver, Asah2
distributed with endosome-like organelles in hepatocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

El Bawab et al. (2000) found that ASAH2 catalyzed hydrolysis of ceramide
with a pH optimum between pH 7.5 and 9.5 in transfected human embryonic
kidney cells. ASAH2 activity was independent of EDTA, Mg(2+), and
Ca(2+), but it was inhibited by the reducing agent dithiolthreitol.

GENE STRUCTURE

Avramopoulos et al. (2007) determined that the ASAH2 gene contains 20
exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Avramopoulos et al. (2007) mapped the
ASAH2 gene to chromosome 10q11.23.

605210	TITLE *605210 DISRUPTED IN SCHIZOPHRENIA 1; DISC1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DISC1 regulates multiple aspects of embryonic and adult neurogenesis
(Kim et al., 2009).

CLONING

Millar et al. (2000) isolated and sequenced a translocation breakpoint
region on chromosome 1q42 that had been identified by St. Clair et al.
(1990) in a large Scottish family with mental and/or behavioral
disorders, including schizophrenia (see 604906), schizoaffective
disorder, recurrent major depression, and adolescent conduct and
emotional disorders. Within the 1q42 chromosomal region, Millar et al.
(2000) identified 2 novel genes directly disrupted by the translocation,
which the authors termed 'disrupted in schizophrenia' 1 and 2 (DISC1 and
DISC2, 606271). The major DISC1 gene is predicted to encode an 854-amino
acid protein containing a globular N-terminal domain and a helical
C-terminal domain with the potential to form a coiled-coil by
interaction with another protein(s). Northern blot analysis identified a
7.5-kb mRNA transcript with ubiquitous expression. DISC2 apparently
specifies a single exon thought to be a noncoding RNA molecule that is
antisense to DISC1, an arrangement that has been observed at other loci
where the antisense RNA may regulate expression of the sense gene.
Millar et al. (2000) suggested that DISC1 and DISC2 may confer
susceptibility to psychiatric illnesses.

Ma et al. (2002) cloned and characterized mouse Disc1, which encodes an
851-amino acid protein that shares 56% sequence identity with the human
protein. Both the mouse and human genes show conservation of leucine
zipper and coiled-coil domains. In situ hybridization in adult mouse
brain showed a restricted expression pattern, with highest levels in the
dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and lower expression in CA1-CA3 of the
hippocampus, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and olfactory bulbs. Ozeki et
al. (2003) cloned and characterized mouse and rat Disc1.

Using Western blot analysis of human brain tissue and cultured human
cell lines, Sawamura et al. (2005) found that the DISC1 protein was
expressed as 2 distinct bands of 95 to 100 kD and 75 to 85 kD.
Subcellular fractionation showed that the 95- to 100-kD isoform was
enriched in the cytoplasm, whereas the 75- to 85-kD isoform was present
in both the nucleus and cytoplasm.

GENE FUNCTION

Ozeki et al. (2003) demonstrated that rodent Disc1 expression displayed
pronounced developmental regulation, with the highest levels in late
embryonic life during development of the cerebral cortex. In a yeast
2-hybrid assay of a human whole brain cDNA library, DISC1 interacted
with a variety of cytoskeletal proteins. One of these, NUDEL (NDEL1;
607538), is associated with cortical development and is linked to LIS1
(601545). A schizophrenia-associated DISC1 mutant with a C-terminal
257-residue truncation did not bind NUDEL. Expression of mutant DISC1,
but not wildtype DISC1, reduced neurite extension in rat adrenal
pheochromocytoma cells.

Using yeast 2-hybrid, mammalian 2-hybrid, and coimmunoprecipitation
assays, Morris et al. (2003) showed that DISC1 interacts with multiple
proteins of the centrosome and cytoskeletal system, including MIPT3
(607380), MAP1A (600178), and NUDEL; proteins that localize receptors to
membranes, including alpha-actinin-2 (ACTN2; 102573) and beta-4-spectrin
(SPTBN4; 606214); and proteins that transduce signals from membrane
receptors, including ATF4 (604064) and ATF5 (606398). Truncated mutant
DISC1 failed to interact with ATF4, ATF5, or NUDEL. Deletion mapping
demonstrated that DISC1 has distinct interaction domains: MAP1A
interacts via its LC2 domain with the N terminus of DISC1, whereas MIPT3
and NUDEL bind via their C-terminal domains to the central coiled-coil
domain of DISC1, and ATF4/5 bind via their C-terminal domains to the C
terminus of DISC1. In its full-length form, the DISC1 protein localized
to predominantly perinuclear punctate structures which extended into
neurites in some cells; mutant truncated DISC1, by contrast, was seen in
a diffuse pattern throughout the cytoplasm and abundantly in neurites.
Both forms colocalized with the centrosomal complex, although truncated
less abundantly than full-length DISC1. Although both full-length and
mutant DISC1 were found in microtubule fractions, neither form appeared
to bind directly to microtubules, but rather did so in a MIPT3-dependent
fashion that was stabilized by taxol. Morris et al. (2003) concluded
that DISC1 is a multifunctional protein whose truncation may contribute
to schizophrenia susceptibility by disrupting intracellular transport,
neurite architecture, and/or neuronal migration.

Millar et al. (2005) showed that DISC1 interacts with the UCR2 domain of
phosphodiesterase-4B (PDE4B; 600127), implicated in susceptibility to
schizophrenia, and that elevation of cellular cAMP leads to dissociation
of PDE4B from DISC1 and in increase in PDE4B activity. The
phosphodiesterases inactivate cAMP, a second messenger implicated in
learning, memory, and mood. Millar et al. (2005) proposed a mechanistic
model whereby DISC1 sequesters PDE4B in resting cells and releases it in
an activated state in response to elevated cAMP.

Kamiya et al. (2005) identified Disc1 as a component of the
microtubule-associated dynein motor complex in rat PC12 neural precursor
cells. Disc1 was essential for maintaining the motor complex at the
centrosome. A schizophrenia-associated C-terminally truncated Disc1
mutant functioned in a dominant-negative manner by interacting with and
redistributing wildtype Disc1 and by disassociating the Disc1-dynein
complex from the centrosome. Depletion of endogenous Disc1 by RNA
interference or expression of truncated Disc1 impaired neurite outgrowth
in PC12 cells in vitro. In embryonic mice, Disc1 RNA interference led to
impaired cerebral cortex development. Kamiya et al. (2005) concluded
that loss of normal DISC1 function during cerebral cortex development
may underlie neurodevelopmental dysfunction in schizophrenia.

Sawamura et al. (2005) analyzed the 75- to 85-kD isoform of DISC1 in
postmortem orbitofrontal cortex from 3 groups of 15 individuals with
schizophrenia, major depression, and bipolar disorder, respectively, and
15 controls. There was an increased P:S ratio (nuclear
pellet:postnuclear supernatant) in schizophrenia and major depression
compared to controls; the increase in bipolar disorder did not reach
statistical significance. The P:S ratio changes in major depression were
significantly influenced by substance/alcohol abuse and by postmortem
interval. The alteration in schizophrenic brains was not associated with
confounding factors, although an interaction with substance/alcohol
abuse could not be ruled out.

Burdick et al. (2008) noted that NDE1 (609449) is a homolog of NDEL1 and
also binds to DISC1. NDE1 was expressed at constant levels in the rat
cerebral cortex from embryonic day (E) 14 to adulthood, whereas NDEL1
expression showed a time-course increase peaking at postnatal day 7.
Further studies with a ser704-to-cys (S704C) polymorphism in the DISC1
gene showed that NDE1 bound stronger to ser704, while NDEL1 bound
stronger to cys704. The findings suggested an interaction of these 3
proteins, with possible competitive binding between NDEL1 and NDE1 for
DISC1.

Using knockdown studies, Mao et al. (2009) found that Disc1 was required
for neural progenitor cell proliferation in vitro, during embryonic
mouse brain development, and in adult mouse dentate gyrus. Disc1
interacted directly with Gsk3-beta (GSK3B; 605004) and inhibited
recombinant Gsk3-beta activity in a dose-dependent manner. This
inhibition of Gsk3-beta caused reduced phosphorylation and increased
stabilization of beta-catenin (CTNNB1; 116806). Knockdown of Disc1 in
adult mouse dentate gyrus resulted in hyperactivity and depression-like
behaviors. All effects of Disc1 knockdown were reversed by pharmacologic
inhibition of Gsk3-beta. Mao et al. (2009) concluded that DISC1
regulates neural progenitor proliferation by modulating GSK3-beta
activity and beta-catenin abundance.

By immunoprecipitation analysis of cotransfected HEK293 cells, Enomoto
et al. (2009) found that mouse Disc1 interacted with girdin (CCDC88A;
609736), a protein required for proper migration and positioning of
mouse dentate gyrus cells. Domain mapping revealed that the N-terminal
globular domain of Disc1 interacted with the N-terminal domain of
girdin. Girdin colocalized with Disc1 in cultured rat hippocampal
neurons, and knockdown of Disc1 via small interfering RNA impaired
girdin localization at growth cones.

Kim et al. (2009) found that adenovirus-mediated delivery of Kiaa1212
(CCDC88A) or a short hairpin RNA targeting Disc1 in adult mouse newborn
neurons caused elevated Akt (AKT1; 164730) signaling and resulted in a
migratory and positioning defect in the manipulated neurons. Disc1
knockdown or Kiaa1212 overexpression also caused an increase in neuronal
soma size and accelerated primary dendrite branching. Disc1 and Kiaa1212
coimmunoprecipitated from cultured mouse hippocampal neurons, dissected
adult mouse hippocampus, and transfected HEK293 cells. Direct
interaction of Disc1 with Kiaa1212 prevented Kiaa1212-dependent
activation of Akt signaling, and knockdown of Kiaa1212 abrogated
Disc1-dependent downregulation of Akt signaling. Pharmacologic blockage
of Mtor (FRAP1; 601231) also abrogated the effects of Disc1 knockdown or
Kiaa1212 overexpression, suggesting that Mtor is a major downstream
mediator of this signaling pathway.

Ishizuka et al. (2011) reported that phosphorylation of DISC1 acts as a
molecular switch from maintaining proliferation of mitotic progenitor
cells to activating migration of postmitotic neurons in mice.
Unphosphorylated DISC1 regulates canonical Wnt signaling via an
interaction with GSK3-beta, whereas specific phosphorylation at
serine-710 triggers the recruitment of Bardet-Biedl syndrome (see
209900) proteins to the centrosome. In support of this model, loss of
BBS1 (209901) leads to defects in migration, but not proliferation,
whereas DISC1 knockdown leads to deficits in both. A phospho-dead mutant
can only rescue proliferation, whereas a phospho-mimic mutant rescues
exclusively migration defects. Ishizuka et al. (2011) concluded that
their data highlight a dual role for DISC1 in corticogenesis and
indicate that phosphorylation of this protein at serine-710 activates a
key developmental switch.

By Western blot analysis of 60 fractionated postmortem brain samples
divided approximately evenly between individuals diagnosed with chronic
schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or depression, and normal controls,
Leliveld et al. (2008) found that DISC1 partitioned in the insoluble
pellet in a subset of cases with psychiatric disease. In transfected
human neuroblastoma cells, when DISC1 was expressed at low levels, it
interacted with endogenous NDEL1; in contrast, when DISC1 was expressed
at high levels, it became insoluble and did not interact with NDEL1.

Using transfected COS-7 cells and cultured rat neurons, Atkin et al.
(2012) found that overexpressed human DISC1 accumulated in perinuclear
aggregates. Insoluble DISC1 recruited endogenous DISC1 away from the
mobile pool of DISC1 puncta and disrupted mitochondrial movement.
Treatment of cultured rat neurons with hydrogen peroxide shifted the
distribution of endogenous Disc1 to an insoluble fraction. Inhibition of
the proteasome or lysosome acidification increased the number of
DISC1-containing aggregates, suggesting that overexpressed DISC1 was
recruited to the aggresome-autophagy pathway for protein removal. Atkin
et al. (2012) concluded that insoluble DISC1 associates with aggresomes
and negatively impacts neuronal function.

Eastwood et al. (2010) found that the DISC1 binding partner PCM1
(600299) was localized to the centrosome in glia of human superior
temporal gyrus, but not in neurons, which showed widespread
immunoreactivity. The authors quantified centrosomal PCM1
immunoreactivity in superior temporal gyrus glia of 81 controls and 67
subjects with schizophrenia, and genotyped the subjects for the 2 DISC1
polymorphisms leu607 to phe (dbSNP rs6675281) and ser704 to cys (dbSNP
rs821616). Centrosomal PCM1 immunoreactive area was smaller in cys704
carriers than in ser704 homozygotes, with a similar trend in phe607
homozygotes compared with leu607 carriers. No differences were seen
between controls and subjects with schizophrenia. The authors concluded
that DISC1 coding variants modulate centrosomal PCM1 localization, and
proposed a role for DISC1 in glial function that may be altered in
psychiatric disorders.

MAPPING

Ma et al. (2002) determined that the mouse Disc1 gene maps to chromosome
8 in a region with homology of synteny to human chromosome 1q42. Ma et
al. (2002) demonstrated that translin-associated factor X (TSNAX;
602964), which is situated 35 kb proximal to the DISC1 sequence on human
chromosome 1, is located approximately 20 kb proximal to Disc1 in the
mouse at 69.5 cM.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The family studied by St. Clair et al. (1990) and Millar et al. (2000)
was originally ascertained by Jacobs et al. (1970), who reported the
translocation in the propositus, who had adolescent conduct disorder,
and in members of 4 generations of the extended family. Blackwood et al.
(2001) provided a follow-up. Of the 87 members of the family who were
karyotyped, 37 carried the (1;11)(q42;q14.3) translocation. A
psychiatric diagnosis was reached in 29 carriers, 38 noncarriers, and
the 2 founders (who were not karyotyped). The range of symptoms in this
family crossed traditional diagnostic boundaries, and the locus
identified by the breakpoint on 1q42 appeared to be implicated in either
schizophrenia or bipolar disorder (125480). Furthermore, Blackwood
(2000) reported abnormalities in the auditory P300 event-related
potential, which showed prolonged latency and reduced amplitude in
affected members of the family.

Ekelund et al. (2001) used a large, population-based study sample (221
Finnish families, 557 affected individuals) to refine the localization
of schizophrenia loci on chromosome 1q. The results were analyzed
separately for families originating from an internal isolate of Finland
and for families from the rest of Finland, as well as for all families
jointly. Evidence for linkage was obtained for 1 locus in the combined
sample (maximum lod = 2.71, D1S2709) and in the nuclear families from
outside the internal isolate (maximum lod = 3.21, D1S2709). In the
families from the internal isolate the strongest evidence for linkage
was obtained with markers located 22 cM centromeric from this marker
(maximum lod = 2.30, D1S245). The strongest evidence for linkage in the
combined study sample was obtained for marker D1S2709, which is a marker
within DISC1. In a follow-up study to Ekelund et al. (2001), Ekelund et
al. (2004) genotyped 300 polymorphic markers on chromosome 1 using a
sample of 70 Finnish families with multiple individuals affected with
schizophrenia or related conditions. They again found linkage on
chromosome 1q42 maximizing within the DISC1 gene (dbSNP rs1000731, lod
of 2.70).

By analysis of SNPs and corresponding haplotypes across candidate genes
in the 1q42 region identified by Ekelund et al. (2001) as being linked
to schizophrenia in a Finnish sample, Hennah et al. (2003) identified a
significant region of interest within the DISC1 gene. They identified a
2-SNP haplotype spanning from intron 1 to exon 2 of the DISC1 gene,
designated HEP3 (605210.0001), and demonstrated that it was
undertransmitted to affected women in the general Finnish population.
The HEP3 haplotype also displayed sex differences in transmission
distortion, the undertransmission being significant only in affected
females. Hodgkinson et al. (2004) presented data from a case-control
study of a North American white population, confirming the
underrepresentation of the HEP3 haplotype in individuals with
schizoaffective disorder. Multiple haplotypes contained within 4
haplotype blocks extending between exon 1 and exon 9 were associated
with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar disorder.
Hodgkinson et al. (2004) also found overrepresentation of a missense
allele of the DISC1 gene, leu607 to pro (L607P; dbSNP rs6675281) in
schizoaffective disorder. These data supported the idea that these
apparently distinct disorders have at least a partially convergent
etiology and that variation at the DISC1 locus predisposes individuals
to a variety of psychiatric disorders.

Cannon et al. (2005) conducted a population-based twin cohort study in
Finland to examine the association of SNPs of DISC1 and TRAX (TSNAX;
602964) with schizophrenia and several endophenotypic traits thought to
be involved in the disease pathogenesis. Two hundred and thirty-six
subjects consisting of 7 pairs concordant for schizophrenia (6
monozygotic, 1 dizygotic), 52 pairs discordant for schizophrenia (20
monozygotic, 32 dizygotic), and 59 demographically balanced normal pairs
(28 monozygotic, 31 dizygotic) were drawn from a twin cohort consisting
of all same-sex twins born in Finland from 1940 through 1957. Diagnosis
was confirmed and performance on neurocognitive tests of short- and
long-term memory as well as gray matter volume measurements as assessed
on MRI images were recorded. A common haplotype incorporating 3 SNPs
near the translocation breakpoint of DISC1 (HEP1; odds ratio, 2.6; p =
0.02) and a rare haplotype incorporating 4 markers from the DISC1 and
TRAX genes (combined HEP2/HEP3; odds ratio, 13.0; p = 0.001) were
significantly overrepresented among individuals with schizophrenia.
These haplotypes were also associated with several quantitative and
endophenotypic traits including impairments in short- and long-term
memory, functioning, and reduced gray matter density in the prefrontal
cortex.

Song et al. (2008) analyzed the regions of likely functional
significance in the DISC1 gene in 288 patients with schizophrenia and
288 controls. Six patients with schizophrenia were heterozygous for
'ultra-rare' missense variants (R37W, S90L, T603I, G14A, and R418H) not
found in 288 controls (p = 0.015) and shown to be ultra-rare by their
absence in a pool of 10,000 control alleles. Song et al. (2008)
concluded that these variants in DISC1 are associated with an
attributable risk of about 2% for schizophrenia. In addition, they
replicated the finding that 2 common structural variants (Q264R and
S704C) slightly elevate the risk for schizophrenia (OR, 1.3, 95% CI,
1.0-1.7).

Schumacher et al. (2009) reported a circumscribed interval in intron 9
of DISC1, which was significantly associated with schizophrenia in
females (p = 4.0 x 10(-5)) and contributed most strongly to early-onset
cases (p = 9.0 x 10(-5)) in a central European population of 1,621
individuals. The SNP interplay effect between dbSNP rs1538979 and dbSNP
rs821633 significantly conferred disease risk in male patients with
schizophrenia (p = 0.016; OR, 1.57). In a metaanalysis of 9
schizophrenia samples from different European populations covering 50
SNPs, the authors found evidence for a common schizophrenia risk
interval within DISC1 introns 4 to 6 (p = 0.002; OR, 1.27). Schumacher
et al. (2009) proposed a complex association between schizophrenia and
DISC1, including the presence of different risk loci and SNP interplay
effects.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hikida et al. (2007) developed a transgenic mouse model expressing a
dominant-negative truncated form of human DISC1. In vivo brain MRI
showed enlarged lateral ventricles particularly on the left side in
juvenile mutant mice, similar to asymmetric brain changes observed in
patients with schizophrenia. There was also selective reduction of
immunoreactivity to parvalbumin (PVALB; 168890) in the cortex, marking a
possible interneuron deficit. Mutant mice displayed several behavioral
abnormalities, including hyperactivity, disturbances in sensorimotor
gating and olfactory-associated behavior, and an
anhedonia/depression-like deficit. Hikida et al. (2007) suggested that
the dominant-negative human DISC1 transgenic mouse could be an animal
model for schizophrenia.

Li et al. (2007) used an inducible and reversible transgenic system to
demonstrate that early postnatal, but not adult induction, of mutant
C-terminal DISC1 in mice resulted in a cluster of schizophrenia-related
phenotypes, including reduced hippocampal dendritic complexity,
decreased hippocampal synaptic transmission, depressive-like traits,
abnormal spatial working memory, and reduced sociability. Li et al.
(2007) postulated that alterations in DISC1 function during brain
development may contribute to pathogenesis of schizophrenia.

Clapcote et al. (2007) reported the behavioral phenotypes of 2
ENU-induced Disc1 mouse mutants: Q31L and L100P, both in exon 2. All
mutant mice were viable and grossly indistinguishable from their
wildtype littermates. L110P-mutant mice showed a schizophrenic-like
phenotype, with decreased prepulse inhibition and latent inhibition that
could be ameliorated by antipsychotic treatment. In contrast,
Q31L-mutant mice showed depressive-like behavior, with deficits in the
forced swim test and other measures that could be reversed by treatment
with the antidepressant buproprion, but not by rolipram, a PDE4
inhibitor. Brain MRI showed decreased brain volume in L100P-mutant mice
(decreased by 13%) and L31-mutant mice (decreased by 6%). Both mutant
Disc1 proteins showed decreased binding to PDE4B, and Q31L-mutant mice
had decreased PDE4B activity in the brain.

Kvajo et al. (2008) generated mice carrying a deletion in the mouse
Disc1 gene, resulting in premature termination, that modeled the
disease-associated translocation identified in humans and associated
with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder by Blackwood et al. (2001).
Mutant mice had alterations in the organization of newly born and mature
neurons of the dentate gyrus. Field recordings showed a deficit in
short-term plasticity in the hippocampus of mutant mice. Both homozygous
and heterozygous mutant mice showed a selective impairment in working
memory during a battery of cognitive tests. The results were consistent
with malfunction of neural circuits.

Wood et al. (2009) mapped the expression of zebrafish Disc1 and studied
its role in early embryonic development using morpholino antisense
methods. There was a critical requirement for Disc1 in oligodendrocyte
development by promoting specification of Olig2 (606386)-positive cells
in the hindbrain and other brain regions. Disruption of neuregulin
(Nrg1; 142445) and ErbB (EGFR; 131550) signaling in zebrafish brain
development yielded similar defects to those seen in disc1 morphant
embryos. Knockdown of Disc1 or Nrg1 caused near total loss of
Olig2-positive cerebellar neurons, but caused no apparent loss of spinal
motor neurons. Wood et al. (2009) suggested that Disc1 and Nrg1 function
in common or related pathways controlling development of
oligodendrocytes and neurons from Olig2-expressing precursor cells.

In developing mouse hippocampus, Meyer and Morris (2009) showed that in
utero electroporation of Disc1 short hairpin RNAs hindered the migration
of dentate gyrus granule cells. Disc1 knockdown did not affect the
migration of CA1 pyramidal neurons, suggesting that the role of Disc1 in
regulating neuronal migration may be spatially restricted within the
hippocampus. Meyer and Morris (2009) suggested that DISC1 abnormalities
that contribute to the onset of schizophrenia may do so through their
influences on hippocampal development.

Using in utero RNA interference transfer, Niwa et al. (2010) showed that
transient knockdown of Disc1 in prefrontal cortex in mice at embryonic
day 14 led to maturation-dependent deficits in mesocortical dopaminergic
projections and associated behavioral changes, including those in
information processing and cognition.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SCHIZOPHRENIA 9
DISC1, HAPLOTYPE, HEP3

Hennah et al. (2003) identified a common haplotype, HEP3, that was
undertransmitted in Finnish females with schizophrenia (SCZD9; 604906).
The HEP3 haplotype contains 2 SNPS in the DISC1 gene (dbSNP rs751229,
dbSNP rs3738401) that span 62 kb from intron 1 to exon 2. Hodgkinson et
al. (2004) confirmed underrepresentation of the HEP3 haplotype in
individuals with schizoaffective disorder.

Hennah et al. (2005) tested whether identified allelic haplotypes of
TRAX (602964)/DISC were associated with visual or verbal memory
dysfunction known to aggregate with schizophrenia in families. The HEP3
haplotype of DISC1 displayed association with poorer performance on
tests assessing short-term visual memory and attention. Analysis of
affected and unaffected offspring separately revealed that both samples
contributed to the observed association in visual working memory. The
results provided genetic support for the view that the DISC1 gene
contributes to sensitivity to schizophrenia and affects short-term
visual memory functions.

Among Finnish twin pairs discordant for the HEP3 haplotype, Li et al.
(2007) found a significant association between presence of the haplotype
and decreased sociability, suggesting that DISC1 has an effect on social
behavior.

186946	TITLE *186946 FK506-BINDING PROTEIN 2; FKBP2
;;FK506-BINDING PROTEIN, T-CELL, 13-KD; FKBP13
DESCRIPTION For background information on FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs), see FKBP1A
(186945).

CLONING

Jin et al. (1991) reported the cloning and subcellular localization of a
13-kD FK506-binding protein (FKBP13), which has a 21-amino acid signal
peptide and appears to be membrane-associated. The 120-amino acid mature
protein appears to lack a transmembrane domain but a potential
endoplasmic reticulum retention sequence (arg-thr-glu-leu) is found at
its C terminus. FKBP13 shares 51% nucleotide sequence identity and 43%
amino acid sequence identity with FKBP12 (FKBP1; 186945), the
predominant FK506- and rapamycin-binding protein in human T cells. Jin
et al. (1991) noted that conserved residues that comprise the drug
binding site and rotamase active site of FKBP12 are completely conserved
in FKBP13.

GENE STRUCTURE

DiLella et al. (1992) found that the FKBP2 gene is 3 kb long and
contains 6 exons.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, DiLella et al. (1992) mapped the
FKBP2 gene to 11q13.1-q13.3.

Courseaux et al. (1996) used a combination of methods to refine maps of
the approximately 5-Mb region of 11q13 that includes MEN1 (131100). They
proposed the following gene order:
cen--PGA--FTH1--UGB--AHNAK--ROM1--MDU1--CHRM1--COX8--EMK1--FKBP2--PLCB3--[PYGM,
ZFM1]--FAU--CAPN1--[MLK3, RELA]--FOSL1--SEA--CFL1--tel.

607991	TITLE *607991 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 8 (SODIUM-CALCIUM EXCHANGER), MEMBER 3; SLC8A3
;;SODIUM-CALCIUM EXCHANGER 3; NCX3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Plasma membrane sodium-calcium exchangers, such as SLC8A3, are
reversible transporters controlling Ca(2+) homeostasis. The forward
sodium-calcium exchange extrudes 1 Ca(2+) for 3 extracellular Na(+)
ions, using the Na(+) gradient and the electrical potential across the
plasma membrane as an energy source.

CLONING

Nicoll et al. (1996) cloned rat Slc8a3, which they designated Ncx3. The
deduced 927-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal signal peptide, 11
transmembrane segments, a long cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane
segments 5 and 6, and alpha and beta repeat sequences characteristic of
exchange proteins. The authors predicted that the N terminus is
extracellular and the C terminus is intracellular. Slc8a3 contains 5
N-glycosylation sites and 4 phosphorylation sites. Northern blot
analysis of rat tissues detected a 6.0-kb transcript only in brain and
skeletal muscle.

By searching databases for sequences similar to rat Slc8a3, followed by
RT-PCR of neuroblastoma cell line total RNA, Gabellini et al. (2002)
cloned SLC8A3, which they designated NCX3. The deduced 921-amino acid
protein contains an N-terminal cluster of 5 transmembrane domains and a
C-terminal cluster of 5 transmembrane domains. The clusters are
separated by a large hydrophilic intracellular loop. Gabellini et al.
(2002) identified complex alternative splicing in the exons encoding the
intracellular loop. The form expressed in brain and the neuroblastoma
cell line has 7 of 9 exons, lacking exons 3 and 5. In addition to this
isoform, 2 other isoforms were expressed in skeletal muscle: one lacking
only exon 3, and the other lacking exons 3, 4, and 5, resulting in a
terminating frameshift. The predicted proteins range in size from 68 to
100 kD. The coding region of SLC8A3 shares 68% and 71% amino acid
identity with SLC8A1 (182305) and SLC8A2 (601901), respectively, and 97%
identity with rat Slc8a3.

GENE FUNCTION

Nicoll et al. (1996) determined that transfection of rat Slc8a3 into
baby hamster kidney cells mediated a 12-fold increase in Na(+)
gradient-dependent Ca(2+) uptake relative to control cells.

Using promoter-reporter constructs, Gabellini et al. (2002) found that
expression of the SLC8A3 promoter in neuroblastoma cells was promoted by
retinoic acid, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (113505), and rising
cAMP levels. Ca(2+) was inhibitory, and inhibition was mediated by CAMK2
(see 114078)-directed phosphorylation of CREB (see 123810).

GENE STRUCTURE

Gabellini et al. (2002) determined that the SLC8A3 gene contains 9 exons
and spans about 150 kb. Exon 1 is untranslated.

Gabellini et al. (2002) determined that the promoter region of SLC8A3
contains a TATA box and several GC boxes, indicating constitutive
transcription. It also includes binding sites for brain-specific AP2
(107580) transcription factor and for muscle-specific MyoD (159970),
GATA2 (137295), and GATA3 (131320).

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Gabellini et al. (2002) mapped the SLC8A3
gene to chromosome 14q24.2. Nicoll et al. (1996) mapped the mouse Slc8a3
gene to chromosome 12.

ANIMAL MODEL

Sokolow et al. (2004) produced mice deficient in Ncx3. Ncx3-deficient
mice presented a skeletal muscle fiber necrosis and a defective
neuromuscular transmission, reflecting the absence of Ncx3 in the
sarcolemma of the muscle fibers and at the neuromuscular junction. The
defective neuromuscular transmission was characterized by the presence
of electromyographic abnormalities. The findings indicated that NCX3
plays an important role in vivo in the control of Ca(2+) concentrations
in skeletal muscle fibers and at the neuromuscular junction.

Molinaro et al. (2008) demonstrated that homozygous ablation of the Ncx3
gene in mice increased the extent of ischemic brain lesions after middle
cerebral artery occlusion, particularly in the temporoparietal cortex,
compared to controls. Cultured hippocampal cells from Ncx3-deficient
mice showed significantly increased cell death in response to oxygen
glucose deprivation compared to wildtype cells. Hypoxic conditions
increased the reverse mode of the transporter in wildtype cells, but
this reverse current was significantly decreased in Ncx3-deficient
cells. The findings indicated impaired Ca(2+) and Na(+) homeostasis
resulting from absence of Ncx3. Molinaro et al. (2008) noted that NCX3
activity is ATP-independent and can thus function normally even during
ischemic conditions, and suggested that wildtype Ncx3 may have
beneficial effects during hypoxic conditions by decreasing cellular
Na(+) content in the initial stages.

604409	TITLE *604409 GLUCOCORTICOID MODULATORY ELEMENT-BINDING PROTEIN 1; GMEB1
;;PARVOVIRUS INITIATION FACTOR, p96 SUBUNIT
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using heat-shock protein-27 (HSP27; 602195) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid
assay, Theriault et al. (1999) cloned a human cDNA encoding a deduced
573-amino acid protein that they called glucocorticoid modulatory
element-binding protein-1 (GMEB1). The GMEB1 protein has a KDWK domain,
contains sequences that are 95% identical to 3 tryptic peptides of rat
GMEB1, and shares 38% identity with rat GMEB2. A rabbit antibody raised
against a recombinant GMEB1 fusion protein detected an 85-kD polypeptide
in several human and mouse cell lines, in rat liver, and in different
mouse tissues. The authors suggested that the difference between the
apparent molecular mass of this polypeptide and the calculated molecular
mass of 62.5-kD derived from the protein sequence might reflect the high
content of acidic residues in GMEB1. By immunofluorescence of HeLa cells
expressing recombinant GMEB1, the authors localized the protein to the
nucleus. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the in vivo
interaction of HSP27 with GMEB1. GMEB1 translated in reticulocyte
lysates bound to 21-bp GME oligonucleotides in a gel-shift assay. The
resulting complex was similar in size to the complex obtained using rat
liver nucleotide extracts. Both complexes were supershifted with an
antibody specific to human GMEB1. The authors concluded that GMEB1 is a
trans-acting DNA-binding protein that may mediate the demonstrated
functions of GME as a positive modulator of the glucocorticoid response.

Christensen et al. (1999) copurified GMEB1 in a complex with GMEB2
(607451) from HeLa cell nuclear extracts. Using degenerate primers
designed from the amino acid sequence followed by 5-prime and 3-prime
RACE, they cloned the full-length cDNAs. The deduced GMEB1 protein,
which they called p96, contains 563 amino acids and has a calculated
molecular mass of 60.4 kD. By SDS/PAGE analysis, the apparent molecular
mass was 96 kD. GMEB1 contains an N-terminal KDWK domain, and a highly
acidic C terminus that likely forms a coiled-coil structure. Recombinant
and endogenous GMEB1 share identical mobilities when analyzed by
SDS/PAGE analysis, indicating a lack of posttranslational modification.
Within the N-terminal KDWK domain, GMEB1 shares about 80% identity with
GMEB2; overall, they share about 40% identity.

GENE FUNCTION

Christensen et al. (1999) noted that the complex of GMEB1 and GMEB2,
which they designated parvovirus initiation factor (PIF) subunits p96
and p79, respectively, was originally recognized as a site-specific
DNA-binding complex essential for parvovirus DNA replication.
Christensen et al. (1999) found that GMEB2 and GMEB1 self-associate when
expressed alone, and that they form heterodimers when expressed
together. Cross-linking experiments indicated that no higher-order
multimers were formed. Each protein was active in promoter activation
assays, and the complex bound regulatory elements within the promoter
regions of tyrosine animotransferase (613018) and the transferrin
receptor gene (190010). Within its recognition site, PIF coordinately
bound 2 copies of the tetranucleotide PuCGPy, and these could be spaced
from 1 to 15 nucleotides apart.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the GMEB1
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP stSG1681R).

602746	TITLE *602746 TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR RECEPTOR SUPERFAMILY, MEMBER 14; TNFRSF14
;;HERPESVIRUS ENTRY MEDIATOR; HVEM;;
HERPESVIRUS ENTRY MEDIATOR A; HVEA;;
TR2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TNFRSF14, or HVEM, activates NF-kappa-B (see 164011) through the
canonical TNF-related cytokine LIGHT (TNFSF14; 604520), serving as a
costimulatory pathway during activation of T cells. TNFRSF14 also
functions as a ligand for the immunoglobulin superfamily members BTLA
(607925) and CD160 (604463), both of which limit inflammatory responses
initiated by T cells (summary by Cheung et al., 2009).

CLONING

Members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family play a key
role in regulating the immune response to infection (see TNFR1, 191190).
By screening for genes that could mediate the entry of herpes simplex
virus (HSV) into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, Montgomery et al.
(1996) identified cDNAs encoding HVEM, a member of the TNFR family. The
predicted 283-amino acid protein has characteristics of a type I
membrane glycoprotein, with an N-terminal signal peptide, 2 potential
sites for addition of N-linked glycans, and a putative membrane-spanning
domain. HVEM contains a cysteine-rich repeat region characteristic of
TNFR family members and shares 17 to 25% amino acid identity with other
TNFRs.

Independently, Kwon et al. (1997) cloned cDNAs encoding HVEM, which they
designated TR2. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.7-kb mRNA in several
tissues, with the highest expression in lung, spleen, and thymus.
Several additional larger mRNAs were observed in some tissues, and
several of the cDNAs contained insertions in the coding region, leading
Kwon et al. (1997) to suggest that HVEM is regulated at the level of
mRNA maturation. These authors reported that the in vitro translation
product was 32 kD by SDS-PAGE.

Marsters et al. (1997) also identified HVEM as a novel member of the
TNFR family. They attributed differences between their predicted amino
acid sequence and that of Montgomery et al. (1996) to polymorphism.

Hsu et al. (1997) cloned cDNAs for the mouse HVEM homolog, which they
designated ATAR (another TRAF-associated receptor). The predicted
276-amino acid mouse protein shares only 45% protein sequence identity
with human HVEM.

GENE FUNCTION

Montgomery et al. (1996) suggested that HVEM plays an important role in
HSV pathogenesis because it enhanced the entry of several wildtype HSV
strains of both serotypes into CHO cells, and mediated HSV entry into
activated human T cells.

Using epitope-tagged HVEM, Marsters et al. (1997) found that HVEM
interacted in vivo with several TNFR-associated factor (TRAF) proteins,
including TRAF1 (601711), TRAF2 (601895), TRAF3 (601896), and TRAF5
(602356). Expression of HVEM activated JNK1 (601158), NF-kappa-B, and
AP1 (165160), which control expression of multiple genes in response to
infection or cellular stress. Marsters et al. (1997) concluded that HVEM
is linked via TRAFs to signal transduction pathways that activate the
immune response.

By flow cytometric and RT-PCR analysis, Morel et al. (2000) showed that
the expression of the HVEM ligand, LIGHT, is upregulated, whereas HVEM
expression is downregulated, after T-cell activation, particularly
CD8-positive T-cell activation.

Using tetramer analysis, Sedy et al. (2005) found that the extracellular
Ig domain of BTLA interacted with the most membrane-distal cysteine-rich
domain of HVEM. Flow cytometric and Western blot analyses showed that
HVEM induced BTLA tyrosine phosphorylation and inhibited T-cell
proliferation in a BTLA-dependent manner.

By surface plasmon resonance analysis of a secreted protein library,
Gonzalez et al. (2005) identified HVEM as a specific, high-affinity
coreceptor for BTLA. HVEM bound LIGHT at a site distinct from that bound
by BTLA, and the 3 proteins could form a ternary complex. The
BTLA-binding site in HVEM overlapped with that for HSV glycoprotein D,
indicating that BTLA likely interacts with the first cysteine-rich
domain of HVEM. Binding of HVEM to BTLA inhibited T-cell proliferation.
Gonzalez et al. (2005) concluded that HVEM and BTLA form an inhibitory
coreceptor pair.

Using flow cytometry, Western blot, and immunocytochemical analyses and
reporter assays, Cheung et al. (2009) demonstrated that
membrane-expressed or soluble herpes virus envelope glycoprotein D,
BTLA, and CD160 (604463) functioned as activating ligands of HVEM,
promoting NFKB activation and cell survival. BTLA and CD160 engagement
induced the recruitment of TRAF2, but not TRAF3, to HVEM, which
specifically activated the RELA (164014), but not the RELB (604758),
form of NFKB. Cheung et al. (2009) concluded that HVEM and BTLA form a
bidirectional signaling pathway regulating cell survival and inhibitory
responses between interacting cells.

Shui et al. (2012) reported an important role for epithelial HVEM in
innate mucosal defense against pathogenic bacteria. HVEM enhances immune
responses by NF-kappa-B-inducing kinase-dependent STAT3 (102582)
activation, which promotes the epithelial expression of genes important
for immunity. During intestinal Citrobacter rodentium infection, a mouse
model for enteropathogenic E. coli infection, Hvem-null mice showed
decreased Stat3 activation, impaired responses in the colon, higher
bacterial burdens, and increased mortality. Shui et al. (2012)
identified the immunoglobulin superfamily molecule CD160, expressed
predominantly by innate-like intraepithelial lymphocytes, as the ligand
engaging epithelial HVEM for host protection. Likewise, in pulmonary
Streptococcus pneumoniae infection, HVEM is also required for host
defense. Shui et al. (2012) concluded that their results pinpointed HVEM
as an important orchestrator of mucosal immunity, integrating signals
from innate lymphocytes to induce optimal epithelial Stat3 activation,
which indicated that targeting HVEM with agonists could improve host
defense.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

HSV infection requires binding of the viral envelope glycoprotein D (gD)
to cell surface receptors. Carfi et al. (2001) reported the x-ray
structures of a soluble, truncated ectodomain of gD both alone and in
complex with the ectodomain of its cellular receptor, TNFRSF14, which
they called HVEA. Two bound anions suggested possible binding sites for
another gD receptor, a 3-O-sulfonated heparan sulfate. The structures
revealed a V-like immunoglobulin fold at the core of gD that is closely
related to cellular adhesion molecules and flanked by large N- and
C-terminal extensions. The receptor-binding segment of gD, an N-terminal
hairpin, appeared conformationally flexible, suggesting that a
conformational change accompanying binding might be part of the viral
entry mechanism.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Kwon et al. (1997) mapped the
HVEM gene to 1p36.3-p36.2. This region also contains the TNFR genes CD30
(153243), ILA (602250), TXGP1L (600315), and TNFR2 (191191), suggesting
that HVEM evolved through a localized gene duplication event.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using a mouse model of acute hepatitis, Wahl et al. (2009) showed that
Hvem -/- mice had lower serum alanine transaminase (GPT; 138200) levels
and lower Ifng (147570), but higher protective Il22 (605330) levels.
Histologic analysis showed attenuated disease in Hvem -/- mice. Flow
cytometric analysis demonstrated reduced numbers of liver invariant NKT
cells, but these cells produced more Il22 and less Ifng than wildtype
liver invariant NKT cells. Neutralization of Il22 aggravated disease in
both wildtype and Hvem -/- mice. Wahl et al. (2009) concluded that Hvem
expression promotes pathogenic, proinflammatory Th1 responses and
diminishes protective Il22 responses in this hepatitis model.

Steinberg et al. (2008) transferred naive Cd4 (186940)-positive/Cd45rb
(151460)-high T cells, depleted of Cd25 (147730)-positive regulatory T
cells, from Hvem -/- or wildtype mice into Rag (see 179615) -/- mice.
They found that the naive wildtype T cells, and to a lesser extent the
Hvem -/- T cells, induced progressive disease and colitis. However, in
recipient mice that also lacked Hvem, there was a dramatic acceleration
of intestinal inflammation, accompanied by increased T-cell cytokine
production. Transfer of naive T cells into Hvem -/- Rag -/- recipients
treated with anti-Btla reduced both cytokine production in vitro and
colitis development in vivo. Steinberg et al. (2008) concluded that HVEM
can act as a receptor to enhance immune responses by binding LIGHT and
as a ligand to suppress immune responses by binding BTLA.

PROFILAGGRIN, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Profilaggrin is a major protein component of the keratohyalin granules
of mammalian epidermis. It is initially expressed as a large polyprotein
precursor which is subsequently proteolytically processed into
individual functional filaggrin molecules. The filaggrins show wide
species variations and their aberrant expression has been implicated in
a number of keratinizing disorders (Baden et al., 1974; Holbrook et al.,
1982; Sybert et al., 1985).

CLONING

McKinley-Grant et al. (1989) isolated a cDNA clone encoding human
filaggrin. They demonstrated that the human gene encodes a polyprotein
precursor containing numerous tandem filaggrin repeats. This structure
is similar to that of the mouse; however, the human filaggrin repeat is
much longer (972 basepairs; 324 amino acids) and shows little sequence
homology to the mouse protein. They found furthermore that the human
filaggrin repeats show considerable sequence variations; such
polymorphism is not found in the mouse. By peptide mapping, they defined
a short linker sequence within the human filaggrin repeat that is
excised by proteolysis to yield functional molecules. They showed by in
situ hybridization that the expression of the gene for the human
filaggrin precursor is tightly regulated at the transcriptional level in
terminally differentiating epidermis.

Gan et al. (1990) isolated genomic DNA and cDNA clones encoding the
5-prime and 3-prime ends of the human gene and mRNA. They found evidence
of likely CAT and TATA sequences, an intron in the 5-prime untranslated
region, and several potential regulatory sequences. The gene is made up
of repeats, all of the same length. Sequences showed considerable
variation, most attributable to single-base changes. Thus, human
filaggrin consists of a heterogeneous population of molecules of
different sizes, charges, and sequences. Amino acid sequences encoding
the amino and carboxyl termini were more conserved, as were the 5-prime
and 3-prime DNA sequences flanking the coding portions of the gene. The
presence of unique restriction enzyme sites in these conserved flanking
sequences enabled Gan et al. (1990) to calculate the size of the
full-length gene and the number of repeats in it; depending on the
source of genomic DNA, the gene contains 10, 11, or 12 filaggrin repeats
that segregate in families in a normal mendelian manner. Thus, the human
profilaggrin gene is polymorphic with respect to size due to simple
allelic differences between individuals.

GENE STRUCTURE

The FLG gene comprises 3 exons (Presland et al., 1992).

MAPPING

Using a cDNA clone as a probe in the study of a panel of mouse-human
somatic cell hybrids retaining overlapping subsets of human chromosomal
regions and for chromosomal in situ hybridization, McKinley-Grant et al.
(1989) demonstrated that the human filaggrin gene maps to 1q21.
Rothnagel et al. (1994) mapped the homologous gene to mouse chromosome 3
by PCR analyses of DNAs isolated from mouse/Chinese hamster somatic cell
hybrids.

Genes of 3 protein families that are specifically expressed in the
course of terminal differentiation of human epidermis have been mapped
to 1q21. Volz et al. (1993) showed that these genes are physically
linked within 2.05 Mb of DNA in the following order: calpactin I light
chain (CAL1L; 114085), trichohyalin (THL; 190370), profilaggrin,
involucrin (IVL; 147360), small proline-rich protein (SPRR1A; 182265),
loricrin (LOR; 152445), and calcyclin (CACY; 114110).

GENE FUNCTION

Smith et al. (2006) reviewed the function of filaggrin, also known as
filament-aggregating protein, in the formation of the stratum corneum.
Keratohyalin granules in the granular layer of interfollicular epidermis
are predominantly composed of the 400-kD protein profilaggrin. Following
a short, unique N-terminal domain, most of the profilaggrin molecule
consists of 10 to 12 repeats of the 324-residue filaggrin sequence (Gan
et al., 1990). Upon terminal differentiation of granular cells,
profilaggrin is proteolytically cleaved into filaggrin peptides of
approximately 37 kD and the N-terminal domain containing an S100-like
calcium-binding domain. Filaggrin rapidly aggregates the keratin
cytoskeleton, causing collapse of the granular cells into flattened
anuclear squames. This condensed cytoskeleton is crosslinked by
transglutaminases during formation of the cornified cell envelope (CCE).
The CCE is the outermost barrier layer of the skin which not only
prevents water loss but also impedes the entry of allergens and
infectious agents. Filaggrin is therefore a key protein in facilitating
epidermal differentiation and maintaining barrier function.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 15 kindreds with ichthyosis vulgaris (146700), Smith et al. (2006)
identified homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations R501X
(135940.0001) and 2282del4 (135940.0002) in the FLG gene in individuals
with a moderate or severe phenotype. They concluded that these mutations
are semidominant; heterozygotes show a very mild phenotype with
incomplete penetrance. The mutations showed a combined allele frequency
of approximately 4% in populations of European ancestry, explaining the
high incidence of ichthyosis vulgaris. Profilaggrin is the major protein
of keratohyalin granules in the epidermis. During terminal
differentiation, it is cleaved into multiple filaggrin peptides that
aggregate keratin filaments. The resultant matrix is crosslinked to form
a major component of the cornified cell envelope. Smith et al. (2006)
found that loss or reduction of this major structural protein leads to
varying degrees of impaired keratinization.

Twin and family studies have indicated a highly heritable predisposition
to atopic disease, including atopic dermatitis (see 603165), allergy,
and asthma (see 600807). Although genetic studies have focused on
immunologic mechanisms of atopic dermatitis, a primary epithelial
barrier defect has been anticipated (Cookson and Moffatt, 2002).
Filaggrin is a key protein that facilitates terminal differentiation of
the epidermis and formation of the skin barrier. Palmer et al. (2006)
showed that 2 independent loss-of-function genetic variants, R501X
(135940.0001) and 2282del4 (135940.0002), in the FLG gene are very
strong predisposing factors for atopic dermatitis (605803). These
mutations had been shown to be the cause of ichthyosis vulgaris in 15
families and isolated cases (Smith et al., 2006). The R501X and 2282del4
variants, carried by approximately 9% of people of European origin, also
showed highly significant association with asthma occurring in the
context of atopic dermatitis. This work established a key role for
impaired skin barrier function in the development of atopic disease.

Sandilands et al. (2007) showed that the 2 common filaggrin-null
mutations reported by Smith et al. (2006) and Palmer et al. (2006) are
ancestral European variants carried on conserved haplotypes. To
facilitate comprehensive analysis in other populations, they reported a
strategy for full sequencing of this large, highly repetitive gene, and
described 15 variants, including 7 that are prevalent. All the variants
were either nonsense or frameshift mutations that, in representative
cases, resulted in loss of filaggrin production in the epidermis. In an
Irish case-control study, the 5 most common European mutations showed a
strong association with moderate to severe childhood eczema. They found
3 additional rare null mutations in this case series, suggesting that
the genetic architecture of filaggrin-related atopic dermatitis consists
of both prevalent and rare risk alleles.

Using the transmission-disequilibrium test in 476 German
parent-offspring trios with atopic dermatitis, Weidinger et al. (2006)
found a significant association between the loss-of-function mutations
R501X and 2282del4 in the FLG gene and extrinsic atopic dermatitis,
allergic sensitization, total IgE level, asthma, and palmar
hyperlinearity; there was no significant association with intrinsic
atopic dermatitis.

Marenholz et al. (2006) genotyped 1092 children with eczema (atopic
dermatitis) from 2 large European populations for the R501X and 2282del4
mutations in the FLG gene and confirmed a highly significant association
between the null mutations and eczema and concomitant asthma. Moreover,
the authors found that these mutations predisposed to asthma, allergic
rhinitis, and allergic sensitization only in the presence of eczema,
highlighting the importance of the epidermal barrier in the pathogenesis
of these disorders (the so-called 'atopic march').

Nomura et al. (2007) sequenced the entire FLG gene in 7 Japanese
patients with ichthyosis vulgaris from 4 unrelated families who were
negative for the R501X and 2282del4 mutations, and identified
heterozygosity for 2 novel mutations, S2554X (135940.0003) and 3321delA
(135940.0004), respectively. The authors then screened 143 Japanese
patients with atopic dermatitis from 140 unrelated families for the
novel null mutations and identified S2554X in 6 patients and 3321delA in
2 patients; they were not found in 156 unrelated Japanese nonatopic and
nonichthyotic controls, yielding a chi-square p value of 0.0015. Noting
that the R501X and 2282del4 mutations were absent from a total of 253
Japanese individuals, including their patients with ichthyosis vulgaris
and atopic dermatitis, Nomura et al. (2007) concluded that FLG mutations
in Japan are different from those found in European-origin populations.

ANIMAL MODEL

Netherton syndrome (256500) is an autosomal recessive multisystemic
disorder characterized by congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma, hair
shaft defects and atopy, caused by mutation in the SPINK5 gene (605010).
Hewett et al. (2005) created mice with an R820X mutation in the Spink5
gene. Newborn homozygotes developed a severe ichthyosis with a loss of
skin barrier function and dehydration, resulting in death within a few
hours. Biochemical analysis of skin revealed a substantial increase in
the proteolytic processing of profilaggrin into its constituent
filaggrin monomers. The authors suggested that in the absence of SPINK5
there is an abnormal increase in the processing of profilaggrin, and
that this may play a direct role in the observed deficit in the adhesion
of the stratum corneum and the severely compromised epidermal barrier
function.

Fallon et al. (2009) reported a 1-bp deletion mutation, 5303delA,
analogous to common human FLG mutations, within the murine Flg gene in
the spontaneous mouse mutant 'flaky tail' (ft). Fallon et al. (2009)
demonstrated that topical application of allergen to mice homozygous for
this mutation resulted in cutaneous inflammatory infiltrates and
enhanced cutaneous allergen priming with development of
allergen-specific antibody responses. These data validated flaky tail as
a useful model of filaggrin deficiency and provided experimental
evidence for the hypothesis that antigen transfer through a defective
epidermal barrier is a key mechanism underlying elevated IgE
sensitization and initiation of cutaneous inflammation in humans with
filaggrin-related atopic disease.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ICHTHYOSIS VULGARIS
DERMATITIS, ATOPIC, 2, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, INCLUDED
FLG, ARG501TER

In 7 unrelated ichthyosis vulgaris (146700) families and 8 additional
'sporadic' cases from Ireland, Scotland, and the U.S., Smith et al.
(2006) found that ichthyosis vulgaris was associated with an
arg501-to-stop (R501X) mutation arising from a 1501C-to-T transition
near the start of repeat 1 in exon 3 of the FLG gene. In 3 families,
ichthyosis vulgaris patients with a very pronounced phenotype were
homozygous for R501X. In other families and isolated cases, they found
individuals with the marked ichthyosis vulgaris phenotype to be compound
heterozygous for R501X and a second mutation, 2282del4, in exon 3
(135940.0002).

Ichthyosis vulgaris is semidominant: that is, heterozygotes had either
no discernible phenotype or milder ichthyosis, whereas homozygotes or
compound heterozygotes had marked ichthyosis and an overt histologic
skin barrier defect. In an extension of the work of Smith et al. (2006),
Palmer et al. (2006) noted that in their families with ichthyosis
vulgaris, many individuals null or heterozygous for filaggrin also had
atopic dermatitis (605803) (eczema) and, in a few cases, also had asthma
(see 600807). Specifically, atopic dermatitis was prevalent in the
individuals with mild ichthyosis vulgaris, all of whom were heterozygous
for either the R501X or 2282del4 FLG-null allele (13/29; 44%). Atopic
dermatitis was particularly common in individuals with severe ichthyosis
vulgaris, all of whom were homozygous or compound heterozygous for
FLG-null alleles (16/21; 76%). None of the individuals in these families
who lacked an FLG-null allele had atopic dermatitis (n = 13). Thus,
atopic dermatitis is inherited as a semidominant trait in these
families, with high penetrance in FLG-null homozygotes or compound
heterozygotes and reduced penetrance in heterozygotes.

Using the transmission-disequilibrium test in 476 German
parent-offspring trios with atopic dermatitis, Weidinger et al. (2006)
found a significant association between the loss-of-function mutations
R501X and 2282del4 in the FLG gene and extrinsic atopic dermatitis,
allergic sensitization, total IgE level, asthma, and palmar
hyperlinearity; there was no significant association with intrinsic
atopic dermatitis.

Marenholz et al. (2006) genotyped 1092 children with eczema (atopic
dermatitis) from 2 large European populations for the R501X and 2282del4
mutations in the FLG gene and replicated the highly significant
association between the null mutations and eczema and concomitant
asthma. Moreover, the authors found that these mutations predisposed to
asthma, allergic rhinitis, and allergic sensitization only in the
presence of eczema, and that the mutations predisposed equally to atopic
(intrinsic) and nonatopic (extrinsic) forms of eczema. They demonstrated
that the presence of 2 null alleles is an independent risk factor for
asthma in children with eczema (OR, 11.76, p = 0.0085). Together, the 2
mutations accounted for approximately 11% of eczema cases in the German
population.

ICHTHYOSIS VULGARIS
DERMATITIS, ATOPIC, 2, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, INCLUDED
FLG, 4-BP DEL, 2282CAGT

See 135940.0001 and Smith et al. (2006). The 2282del4 mutation leads to
a premature termination codon 107 bp downstream and, like R501X, stops
protein translation within the first filaggrin repeat.

Palmer et al. (2006) found an association of the 2282del4 and R501X
genetic variants of the FLG gene with atopic dermatitis; see
135940.0001.

Weidinger et al. (2006) found a significant association between atopic
dermatitis, in particular the extrinsic type, and the R501X and 2282del4
mutations; Marenholz et al. (2006) replicated the association and also
found that the presence of 2 null alleles was an independent risk factor
for asthma in children with eczema. See 135940.0001.

ICHTHYOSIS VULGARIS
DERMATITIS, ATOPIC, 2, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, INCLUDED
FLG, SER2554TER

In affected members of 2 unrelated Japanese families with ichthyosis
vulgaris (146700) who were negative for previously identified null
mutations in the FLG gene, Nomura et al. (2007) identified
heterozygosity for a 7661C-G transversion in exon 3 of the FLG gene,
resulting in a ser2554-to-ter (S2554X) substitution, predicted to cause
premature termination of profilaggrin translation in the filaggrin
repeat domain 7. The older sister of 1 proband, who had a severe
presentation of the disease, was found to be homozygous for S2554X. The
authors then screened 143 Japanese patients with atopic dermatitis
(605803) from 140 unrelated families for this null mutation and
identified S2554X in 6 patients. The mutation was not found in 156
unrelated nonatopic and nonichthyotic Japanese controls.

ICHTHYOSIS VULGARIS

FLG, 1-BP DEL, 3321A

In 2 probands from 2 unrelated Japanese families with ichthyosis
vulgaris (146700), who were negative for previously identified null
mutations in the FLG gene, Nomura et al. (2007) identified
heterozygosity for a 1-bp deletion (3321delA) in exon 3 of the FLG gene,
resulting in a premature termination of profilaggrin translation in
filaggrin repeat domain 2. The authors then screened 143 Japanese
patients with atopic dermatitis (605803) from 140 unrelated families for
this deletion and identified 3321delA in 2 patients. The deletion was
not found in 156 unrelated nonatopic and nonichthyotic Japanese
controls.

610999	TITLE *610999 ENHANCER OF POLYCOMB, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 1; EPC1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using RFP (TRIM27; 602165) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a
testis cDNA library, followed by 3-prime and 5-prime RACE, Shimono et
al. (2000) cloned EPC1. The deduced 836-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 92 kD. It has EPcA, EPcB, and EPcC domains
and a Qx region, all of which are highly conserved from yeast to humans.
Endogenous EPC1 localized to nuclear domains and to the nuclear membrane
in a human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line.

The NuA4 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex is responsible for
acetylation of the N-terminal tails of histone H4 (see 602822) and H2A
(see 613499) in yeast. Its catalytic subunit, Esa1, is homologous to
human TIP60 (HTATIP; 601409). Using affinity purification, Western blot
analysis, cell fractionation, immunoprecipitation, and mass
spectrometry, Doyon et al. (2004) found that TIP60 and its splice
variant, TIP60B/PLIP, were part of a multisubunit NuA4 complex with HAT
activity in several human cell lines. They identified human homologs for
11 of the 12 yeast NuA4 subunits, including EPC1. Two isoforms of EPC1,
containing 813 and 836 amino acids, were detected in the NuA4 complex.

Using HOP (607275) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a heart cDNA
library, Kee et al. (2007) cloned EPC1. Northern blot analysis detected
ubiquitous expression of a 4-kb transcript, with highest levels in heart
and skeletal muscle. Immunohistochemical analysis of embryonic mice
detected decreasing Epc1 expression with age in heart, but increased
expression with age in skeletal muscle. Epc1 was also expressed in
endothelium, spinal ganglia, and cartilage, but not in brain.

GENE FUNCTION

Shimono et al. (2000) found that RFP interacted with EPC1 and that both
proteins repressed gene transcription. Yeast 2-hybrid assays revealed
that the coiled-coil domain of RFP associated with the EPcA domain and
the C-terminal region of EPC. Both proteins coprecipitated from lysates
of human cells and mostly colocalized in the nucleus. The coiled-coil
domain of RFP and the C-terminal region of EPC1 repressed
transcriptional activity in reporter gene assays, whereas the EPcA
domain of EPC1 activated transcriptional activity.

Doyon et al. (2004) found that a recombinant trimeric complex of TIP60,
EPC1, and ING3 (607493) was sufficient to reconstitute nucleasomal HAT
activity in vitro.

Kee et al. (2007) found upregulated expression of Epc1 during
differentiation of a rat myoblast cell line into skeletal myocytes.
Differentiation was induced by Epc1 overexpression and was severely
impaired in Epc1-knockdown cells. Cotransfection of Hop potentiated
Epc1-induced transactivation of myogenin (MYOG; 159980) and myotube
formation. Skeletal muscle of Hop-knockout mice showed decreased
expression of myosin heavy chain (see 160730) and myogenin, and
hamstring muscle of Hop-knockout mice showed delayed healing after
injury. Differentiation was impaired in skeletal myoblasts from
Hop-knockout mice. Kee et al. (2007) concluded that EPC1 plays a role in
initiation of skeletal muscle differentiation and that its interaction
with HOP is required for full activity.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Somatic Mutation in Pancreatic Cancer

Biankin et al. (2012) performed exome sequencing and copy number
analysis to define genomic aberrations in a prospectively accrued
clinical cohort of 142 patients with early (stage I and II) sporadic
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Detailed analysis of 99 informative
tumors identified substantial heterogeneity with 2,016 nonsilent
mutations and 1,628 copy number variations. Biankin et al. (2012)
defined 16 significantly mutated genes, reaffirming known mutations and
uncovering novel mutated genes including additional genes involved in
chromatin modification (EPC1 and ARID2, 609539), DNA damage repair (ATM;
607585), and other mechanisms (ZIM2 (see 601483); MAP2K4, 601335; NALCN,
611549; SLC16A4, 603878; and MAGEA6, 300176). Integrative analysis with
in vitro functional data and animal models provided supportive evidence
for potential roles for these genetic aberrations in carcinogenesis.
Pathway-based analysis of recurrently mutated genes recapitulated
clustering in core signaling pathways in pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma, and identified new mutated genes in each pathway.
Biankin et al. (2012) also identified frequent and diverse somatic
aberrations in genes described traditionally as embryonic regulators of
axon guidance, particularly SLIT/ROBO (see 603742) signaling, which was
also evident in murine Sleeping Beauty transposon-mediated somatic
mutagenesis models of pancreatic cancer, providing further supportive
evidence for the potential involvement of axon guidance genes in
pancreatic carcinogenesis.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Shimono et al. (2000) mapped the EPC1 gene
to chromosome 10p11.

;;ORGANIC ANION TRANSPORTER 6; OAT6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SLC22A20 belongs to a large family of transmembrane proteins that
function as uniporters, symporters, and antiporters to transport organic
ions across cell membranes (Jacobsson et al., 2007).

CLONING

By searching a human database for SLC22 family members, Jacobsson et al.
(2007) identified SLC22A20. The deduced 573-amino acid protein has 12
putative transmembrane domains. Quantitative real-time PCR detected high
expression of rat Slc22a20 in coronal sections taken through the
olfactory bulb and forebrain. Expression was much weaker in other
coronal sections and in liver and adipose tissue, and was not detected
in other brain regions or in peripheral tissues.

GENE STRUCTURE

Jacobsson et al. (2007) determined that the SLC22A20 gene contains 9
exons.

MAPPING

Jacobsson et al. (2007) stated that the SLC22A20 gene maps to chromosome
11q13.1; the mouse Slc22a20 gene maps to chromosome 19qA.

KIRSTEN-RAS-ASSOCIATED GENE;;
DYSTROPHIN-ASSOCIATED GLYCOPROTEIN, 25-KD;;
DAGA5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) is a multisubunit protein
complex that spans the sarcolemma and provides structural linkage
between the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix of
muscle cells. There are 3 main subcomplexes of the DGC: the cytoplasmic
proteins dystrophin (DMD; 300377) and syntrophin (SNTA1; 601017), the
alpha- and beta-dystroglycans (see 128239), and the sarcoglycans (see,
e.g., SGCA; 600119) (Crosbie et al., 2000). The SSPN gene encodes
sarcospan, another member of the DGC.

CLONING

Scott et al. (1994) reported the sequence of a murine gene that is
coamplified with Ki-ras (190070) in the Y1 murine adrenal carcinoma cell
line. The gene, which they designated Krag (Kirsten ras-associated
gene), encodes a predicted 216-amino acid protein with 4 potential
hydrophobic domains. Its hydropathy plot resembles certain of the
transmembrane-4 superfamily members such as CO-029 (600769) and ME491
(155740).

Heighway et al. (1996) isolated the human KRAG gene and showed that the
predicted amino acid sequence is 91% identical to the mouse sequence.
Northern blot analysis showed that KRAG is expressed in a variety of
tissues with highest levels in muscle, where alternative splice variants
were also observed. One end of the YAC contained a sequence that was
identical to that reported for inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor type
2 (ITPR2; 600144), which had previously been mapped to 12p11.

Crosbie et al. (1997) isolated a cDNA for the 25-kD
dystrophin-associated protein from a human skeletal muscle cDNA library.
The cDNA encodes a protein with 4 transmembrane spanning domains, which
the authors termed 'sarcospan.' Northern blot analysis detected a 6.5-kb
mRNA transcript exclusively in skeletal and cardiac muscle; a 4.5-kb
mRNA transcript was also identified in skeletal and cardiac muscle as
well as in thymus, prostate, testes, ovary, small intestine, colon, and
spleen. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that sarcospan complexes
with and is an integral component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein
complex.

GENE STRUCTURE

Heighway et al. (1996) determined that the human KRAG gene contains 3
exons.

Scott et al. (1994) determined that the murine Krag gene contains 3
exons and spans about 20 kb of genomic DNA.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Heighway et al. (1996) mapped the
human KRAG gene to chromosome 12p11.2.

Scott et al. (1994) found that a homologous EST to murine Krag mapped to
chromosome 12.

GENE FUNCTION

Heighway et al. (1996) showed that KRAS2, KRAG, and ITPR2 were all
coamplified in lung and ovarian carcinoma cells.

Several autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (see
253600) are caused by primary mutations in sarcoglycan genes. Crosbie et
al. (2000) showed that the sarcospan protein is lost in patients with
either a complete or partial loss of alpha-, beta-, or gamma-sarcoglycan
(SGCG; 608896). In particular, sarcospan was absent in a
gamma-sarcoglycanopathy (LGDM2C; 253700) patient with normal levels of
alpha-, beta- (600900), and delta-sarcoglycan (601411). The authors
hypothesized that assembly of the complete, tetrameric sarcoglycan
complex is a prerequisite for membrane targeting and localization of
sarcospan. The authors screened over 50 autosomal recessive muscular
dystrophy cases for mutations in sarcospan, but none was identified.

148060	TITLE *148060 KERATIN 8; KRT8
;;K8;;
CYTOKERATIN 8
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Keratin 8 is a type II keratin (Moll et al., 1982). Endo A is the mouse
equivalent. Endo B, which is the equivalent of human keratin 18
(148070), a type I keratin, is coexpressed with Endo A; the 2 appear to
be the first intermediate filament (IF) proteins expressed during murine
development (Jackson et al., 1980). Yamamoto et al. (1990) studied a
full-length cDNA for cytokeratin 8 from placenta. They determined the
distribution of cytokeratin 8 mRNA in various fetal tissues and in
placentae of different gestational ages.

Krauss and Franke (1990) cloned cytokeratin 8 from a genomic library.
The 485-amino acid protein deduced from the exon sequences has a
calculated molecular mass of about 53.5 kD. CK8 shows strong homology
with the corresponding bovine, mouse, and Xenopus proteins. The human
and mouse CK8 share about 82% identity in the N-terminal head domain,
95% identity in the alpha helical rod domain, and 67.5% identity in the
C-terminal tail.

GENE FUNCTION

He et al. (2002) presented evidence that soluble depolymerized K8
subunits were phosphorylated on ser73 by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK1;
601158) upon stimulation of the proapoptotic cytokine receptor Fas
(134637) in colon carcinoma cells. K8 was also phosphorylated following
exposure to ultraviolet light. Coimmunoprecipitation studies indicated
that JNK interacted directly with K8, and K8 was able to sequester a
substantial amount of the 54-kD isoform of JNK. The association of JNK
with K8 correlated with the decreased ability of JNK to phosphorylate
endogenous c-Jun (see 165160). He et al. (2002) hypothesized that K8
phosphorylation could regulate JNK signaling and/or keratin dynamics. Ku
et al. (2002) reported the phosphorylation of K8 ser73 by p38
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK14; 600289). p38 MAPK associated
with K8/K18 complexes in transfected baby hamster kidney cells,
phosphorylated K8 on ser73, and bound specifically to K8 in vitro. Ku et
al. (2002) noted that the leu160-to-pro mutation in K1 (139350.0002)
leads to epidermolytic hyperkeratosis (113800). The comparable mutation
in K8 resulted in hyperphosphorylation of K8 due to neophosphorylation
of ser70 in addition to phosphorylation of ser73, and keratin filament
collapse in the presence of okadaic acid, a phosphatase inhibitor.

GENE STRUCTURE

Krauss and Franke (1990) determined that the CK8 gene contains 8 exons
instead of 9 as is found in all other type II cytokeratins due to lack
of intron 5, and the gene spans over 8.8 kb. The 5-prime flanking region
contains a TATA box, 1 SP1 (189906) motif, and an Alu-like sequence in
an orientation opposite that of the CK8 gene. Intron 1 is long (about
2.5 kb) and contains 3 SP1 sites, 1 AP1 (see 165160) site, and another
Alu element in the same orientation as CK8.

MAPPING

Keratins 8 and 18 of simple epithelia differ from the keratins of
stratified epithelia in tissue expression and regulation. Using PCR to
study DNAs from somatic cell hybrids, Waseem et al. (1990) located a
single active gene for keratin 8 on chromosome 12. This chromosome
contains several genes for type II keratins and also the gene for
keratin 18, the type I keratin that is coexpressed with keratin 8. This
location of both members of a keratin pair on a single chromosome is
unique among keratin genes; it is consistent with the hypothesis that
keratins 8 and 18 may be closer to an ancestral gene than the keratins
of more highly differentiated epithelia.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

About 10% of patients who undergo liver transplantation have cryptogenic
liver disease. In animal models, the absence of heteropolymeric keratins
8 and 18 or the presence of mutant keratins in hepatocytes causes or
promotes liver disease. Ku et al. (1997) demonstrated a germline
mutation in keratin 18 (148070.0001) in 1 of 28 patients with
cryptogenic cirrhosis (see 215600). Of 55 patients with cryptogenic
liver disease screened by Ku et al. (2001), 5 unrelated patients had
mutations in the keratin 8 gene that appeared to have predisposed them
to the disease. Three patients had a gly61-to-cys mutation at a highly
conserved glycine (148060.0001), and the other 2 had a tyr53-to-his
mutation (148060.0002). These mutations were not detected in patients
with other forms of liver disease or in randomly selected patients. In
transfected cells, the gly61-to-cys mutation limited keratin filament
reorganization when the cells were exposed to oxidative stress. In
contrast, the tyr53-to-his mutation destabilized keratin filaments when
transfected cells were exposed to heat or okadaic acid stress.

Following up on the observation that KRT8 and KRT18 mutations are found
in patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis, Ku et al. (2003) investigated
the role of keratin mutations in noncryptogenic cirrhosis and the
incidence of keratin mutations in the general population. The results
suggested that K8 and K18 are likely susceptibility genes for developing
both cryptogenic and noncryptogenic forms of liver disease. They studied
314 liver explants of patients who primarily had noncryptogenic
cirrhosis and compared the results with 349 blood bank volunteers. Seven
unique K8/K18 mutations were found in 11 independent patients with
biliary atresia, hepatitis B/C, alcoholism, primary biliary cirrhosis,
and fulminant hepatitis. Seven of the 11 patients had mutations
previously described in patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis: gly61 to
cys (148060.0001), tyr53 to his (148060.0002), and his127 to leu
(148070.0001). Of the 349 blood bank control samples, only 1 contained
the tyr53-to-his mutation and 1 the gly61-to-cys mutation. Livers with
keratin mutations had cytoplasmic filamentous deposits that were less
frequent in livers without the mutations (P = 0.03).

ANIMAL MODEL

Casanova et al. (1999) generated mice expressing the human KRT8 gene,
leading to a moderate increase in the content of keratin in simple
epithelia. These mice displayed progressive exocrine pancreas
alterations, including dysplasia and loss of acinar architecture,
redifferentiation of acinar to ductal cells, inflammation, fibrosis, and
substitution of exocrine by adipose tissue, as well as increased cell
proliferation and apoptosis. The phenotype was very similar to that
reported for transgenic mice expressing a dominant-negative mutant
TGF-beta type II receptor (TGFBR2; 190182). Casanova et al. (1999)
showed that these Tgfbr2 mutant mice also had elevated KRT8/KRT18
levels. The results indicated that simple epithelial keratins play a
relevant role in the regulation of exocrine pancreas homeostasis and
supported the idea that disruption of mechanisms that normally regulate
keratin expression in vivo could be related to inflammatory and
neoplastic pancreatic disorders.

Jaquemar et al. (2003) determined that the lethality seen in genetically
sensitive K8-null mouse embryos is due to disruption of the trophoblast
giant cell layer that normally forms a barrier between the maternal and
embryonic compartments. Massive hemorrhages of maternal blood were found
between the decidua capsularis and the parietal yolk sac. Maternal tumor
necrosis factor (TNF; 191160) and TNF receptor (see 191190) contributed
to the lethality.

601541	TITLE *601541 BROMODOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 3; BRD3
;;RING3-LIKE GENE; RING3L;;
OPEN READING FRAME X; ORFX
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Nomura et al. (1994) identified ORFX as a non-linked copy of RING3
(BRD2; 601540), a gene in the human major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) class II region on 6p21.3.

MAPPING

Using a PCR probe derived from the ORFX cDNA sequence, Thorpe et al.
(1996) mapped the gene, symbolized here RING3L, by fluorescence in situ
hybridization analysis to 9q34. Several other MHC-related genes have
been found to map to the same region.

GENE FUNCTION

Dawson et al. (2011) demonstrated that I-BET151, a novel small molecule
inhibitor of the BET family, of which BRD3 is a member, has profound
efficacy against human and murine MLL-fusion leukemia cell lines through
the induction of early cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. I-BET151
treatment in 2 human leukemia cell lines with different MLL fusions
altered the expression of a common set of genes whose function may
account for these phenotypic changes. The mode of action of I-BET151 is,
at least in part, due to the inhibition of transcription at key genes
BCL2 (151430), C-MYC (190080), and CDK6 (603368) through the
displacement of BRD3/4, PAFc, and SEC components from chromatin. In vivo
studies indicated that I-BET151 has significant therapeutic value,
providing survival benefit in 2 distinct mouse models of murine

139380	TITLE *139380 GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE-BINDING PROTEIN, BETA-1; GNB1
;;TRANSDUCIN, BETA POLYPEPTIDE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins)
transduce extracellular signals received by transmembrane receptors to
effector proteins. Each subunit of the G protein complex is encoded by a
member of 1 of 3 corresponding gene families, alpha, beta, and gamma
(Hurowitz et al., 2000).

CLONING

Retinal transducin is a guanine nucleotide regulatory protein that
activates a cGMP phosphodiesterase in photoreceptor cells. Fong et al.
(1986) identified and analyzed cDNA clones of the bovine transducin beta
subunit and deduced the primary structure of a 340-amino acid protein.
Significant homology was found with the yeast CDC4 gene product. The
beta-subunit polypeptide, of relative molecular mass 37,375 Da, is
encoded by a 2.9-kb mRNA. All mammalian tissues and clonal cell lines
examined contained at least 2 beta-related mRNAs, usually 1.8 and 2.9 kb
long. The authors suggested that there may be a diversity of beta
subunit-related mRNAs that could encode different proteins.

Codina et al. (1986) cloned a full-length G protein beta-1 subunit
(GNB1) from a human liver cDNA library. They found that the deduced
340-amino acid protein is identical to that encoded by bovine retinal
rod cell cDNA of the beta subunit of transducin.

GENE FUNCTION

Using coprecipitation analysis, Rosskopf et al. (2003) showed that GNB1
formed dimers with all gamma subunits analyzed. The strength of the
interaction was variable and was strongest between GNB1 and GNG3
(608941), GNG10 (604389), GNG12, and GNG13 (607298).

GENE STRUCTURE

Rosskopf et al. (2003) determined that the GNB1 gene contains 12 exons.
The first 2 exons and the last exon are noncoding.

MAPPING

Using a cDNA probe against a mouse/human somatic cell hybrid panel,
Sparkes et al. (1987) mapped the human beta-1 polypeptide of G protein
to human chromosome 1. Levine et al. (1990) confirmed the assignment to
chromosome 1 by Southern analysis of somatic cell hybrids, and Levine et
al. (1990) and Modi et al. (1991) regionalized the assignment to
1pter-p31.2 by in situ hybridization. Although Sparkes et al. (1987) had
mapped the mouse Gnb1 gene to chromosome 19, later studies showed that
Gnb1 is located on distal mouse chromosome 4 (Danciger et al., 1990).

ANIMAL MODEL

In the Rd4/+ mouse, autosomal dominant retinal degeneration cosegregates
with a large inversion spanning nearly all of chromosome 4 (Roderick et
al., 1997). To identify the responsible gene for this phenotype,
Kitamura et al. (2006) focused on the distal breakpoint and found that
it lay in the second intron of the Gnb1 gene, coding for the
transducin-beta-1 protein, which is directly involved in
phototransduction and in the normal maintenance of photoreceptors.
Kitamura et al. (2006) determined that before the beginning of retinal
degeneration in the Rd4/+ retina, the levels of Gnb1 mRNA and
transducin-beta-1 were 50% of those in wildtype retina. Kitamura et al.
(2006) suggested that disruption of the Gnb1 gene is responsible for
Rd4/+ retinal disease.

3; TSSC3;;
TUMOR-SUPPRESSING STF cDNA 3;;
IMPRINTED IN PLACENTA AND LIVER; IPL;;
BECKWITH-WIEDEMANN REGION 1C; BWR1C
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

A region of 11p15.5 contains several genes with documented functional
imprinting, defined as a consistent allelic bias of RNA expression in
somatic tissues. Imprinted genes in this region include H19 (103280),
IGF2 (147470), CDKN1C (600856), and KVLQT1 (607542). The size of the
region that contains these genes is approximately 1 Mb, similar to the
Prader-Willi syndrome (176270)/Angelman syndrome (105830) region of
chromosome 15, which also contains multiple imprinted genes. Qian et al.
(1997) stated that a strong sex bias in the rates of meiotic
recombination in imprinted regions suggested an accessibility model for
genomic imprinting in which extended regions of 'open chromatin'
specific to one type of gamete are selectively modified epigenetically,
leading to allele-specific transcription of at least a subset of the
genes in these regions in the offspring. A prediction is that a
positional cloning approach, i.e., chromosome walking in the vicinity of
known imprinted genes, should be successful in isolating additional
imprinted genes. Qian et al. (1997) described the human and mouse
versions of a novel imprinted gene, symbolized IPL (for 'imprinted in
placenta and liver') by them, that they identified by this approach. IPL
is located between NAP2 (601651) on the centromeric side and KIP2
(CDKN1C; 600856) on the telomeric side. In many human and mouse tissues,
the gene showed tissue-specific expression and functional imprinting,
with the maternal allele active and the paternal allele relatively
inactive. The mouse and human genes showed sequence similarity to
TDAG51, a gene that had been shown to be essential for FAS (134637) gene
expression and susceptibility to apoptosis in a T lymphocyte cell line.
Qian et al. (1997) detected high expression in the placenta, with lower
expression in the chorioamniotic membrane and a very low expression in
fetal and adult liver, lung, and kidney and adult pancreas.

By genetic analysis of a 170-kb region at 11p15.5 between loci D11S601
and D11S679, Schwienbacher et al. (1998) identified 6 transcriptional
units. Three of these, NAP2, CDKN1C, and KVLQT1, had been well
characterized, whereas the other 3 genes were novel. These were
symbolized BWR1A (602631), BWR1B (603240), and BWR1C, with BWR
designating 'Beckwith-Wiedemann region.'

GENE FUNCTION

Muller et al. (2000) stated that TSSC3 is the first apoptosis-related
gene found to be imprinted in placenta, liver, and fetal tissues, where
it is expressed from the maternal allele during normal human
development. Since several embryonal tumors show loss of imprinting of
genes in the 11p15.5 region, Muller et al. (2000) investigated the
imprinting status of TSSC3 in normal human adult brain, neuroblastomas,
medulloblastomas, and glioblastomas. Using a polymorphism in exon 1,
they found that the TSSC3 gene is not imprinted in normal human adult
brain or blood. In contrast, strong allelic bias resembling imprinting
could be detected in most tumors examined. The authors concluded that
the tumors under investigation are associated with a retention of
imprinting of a potential growth inhibitory gene.

MAPPING

Qian et al. (1997) identified the PHLDA2 gene on chromosome 11p15.5, in
a region that contains many imprinted genes. Qian et al. (1997)
determined that the mouse Ipl gene maps to the region of chromosome 7
that is syntenic with human 11p15.5.

GENE STRUCTURE

Like several other imprinted genes, mouse and human IPL are small and
contain small introns; human IPL contains a single 223-bp intron (Qian
et al., 1997).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Ishida et al. (2012) identified a 15-bp tandem repeat (GGGGCGGGGAGGGGC)
located 48 bp upstream of the PHLDA2 transcription start site. The
tandem repeat is present in 87% of chromosomes. The minor allele is a
single copy and found in the remaining 13% of chromosomes.

For discussion of a possible association between variation in this
PHLDA2 promoter variant and birth weight, see 613219.

ANIMAL MODEL

The IPL gene lies in an extended imprinted region of distal mouse
chromosome 7, which also contains the IGF2 gene. Expression of Ipl is
highest in placenta and yolk sac, where its mRNA is derived almost
entirely from the maternal allele. Ipl encodes a small cytoplasmic
protein with a pleckstrin-homology (PH) domain (summary by Frank et al.,
1999). Frank et al. (2002) constructed 2 lines of mice with germline
deletions of this gene and another line deleted for the similar but
nonimprinted gene Tih1 (607054). All 3 lines were viable. There was
consistent overgrowth of the Ipl-null placentas, with expansion of the
spongiotrophoblast. These larger placentas did not confer a fetal growth
advantage; fetal size was normal or slightly decreased in Ipl nulls.
When bred into an Igf2 mutant background, the Ipl deletion partially
rescued the placental but not fetal growth deficiency. Neither fetal nor
placental growth was affected by deletion of Tih1. These results showed
a nonredundant function of Ipl in restraining placental growth. The data
further indicated that Ipl can act, at least in part, independently of
insulin-like growth factor 2 signaling. Thus, genomic imprinting
regulates multiple pathways to control placental size.

610022	TITLE *610022 MYOSIN VC; MYO5C
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using EST database analysis followed by PCR amplification of human
pancreas cDNA, Rodriguez and Cheney (2002) identified a new myosin V
family member that they named MYO5C. The MYO5C gene encodes a
1,742-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 203 kD that
shares approximately 50% identity with family members MYO5A (160777) and
MYO5B (606540). The MYO5C protein consists of a motor domain followed by
6 IQ motifs, a coiled-coil region, and a C-terminal globular domain.
MYO5C contains a serine residue conserved among all 3 class V myosins
whose phosphorylation in MYO5A regulates melanosome binding; however,
MYO5C does not contain the PEST region present in MYO5A and MYO5B.
Northern and dot blot analyses showed expression of an 8.7-kb MYO5C
transcript in salivary gland, stomach, colon, pancreas, lung, thyroid,
prostate, and mammary gland. Immunolocalization in mouse tissues
detected abundant Myo5c protein expression in pancreas, colon, and
stomach. Myo5c was found specifically in the apical regions of
intestinal epithelial cells and in exocrine pancreas.

GENE FUNCTION

Rodriguez and Cheney (2002) demonstrated, by overexpression of a
dominant-negative MYO5C tail construct in HeLa cells, that MYO5C
colocalizes with and perturbs a membrane compartment containing the
transferrin receptor (TFRC; 190010) and RAB8 (165040). Pulse-chase
experiments showed that overexpression of MYO5C also disrupts TFRC
trafficking.

GENE STRUCTURE

Using genomic sequence analysis, Rodriguez and Cheney (2002) determined
that the MYO5C gene consists of at least 39 exons and spans more than
100 kb.

MAPPING

Rodriguez and Cheney (2002) mapped the MYO5C gene to chromosome 15q21,
immediately adjacent to MYO5A, by genomic sequence analysis.

602201	TITLE *602201 EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX PROTEIN 1; ECM1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Mathieu et al. (1994) identified a novel 85-kD protein secreted by a
mouse osteogenic stromal cell line. Bhalerao et al. (1995) showed that
the full-length cDNA is 1.9 kb and contains an open reading frame of
1,677 bp that codes for a protein of 559 amino acids.

Smits et al. (1997) described a genomic clone containing the human
homolog, termed extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM1), from a chromosome
1 cosmid library. The ECM1 gene appeared to be expressed as a 1.8-kb
transcript predominantly in placenta and heart, while an additional
1.4-kb alternatively spliced message was detected in tonsils. The
full-length human ECM1 transcript contains 1,838 bp and has an overall
homology of 79.6% with the mouse Ecm1 cDNA. The transcript codes for a
protein of 540 amino acids that is 69.4% identical and 81.3% similar to
the corresponding mouse protein. The alternatively spliced variant,
1,450 bp long, encodes a protein of 415 amino acids.

GENE STRUCTURE

Smits et al. (1997) demonstrated that the coding region of the human
ECM1 gene comprises 10 exons.

GENE FUNCTION

Oyama et al. (2003) noted that HLA-subtype susceptibility and high rates
of other autoimmune disorders suggest that autoantibodies to specific
mucocutaneous antigens may be involved in the etiology of lichen
sclerosis (151590). The clinicopathologic similarities between lichen
sclerosis and lipoid proteinosis, which results from mutations in ECM1,
suggested that this protein may be an autoantigen in lichen sclerosis.
By immunoblotting, IgG autoantibodies to ECM1 were found in 20 of 30
lichen sclerosis serum samples. The highest titer was 1 in 20. These
samples, and those from 56 other patients with lichen sclerosis, showed
immunoreactivity to the recombinant ECM1 protein; 6 of 85 control serum
samples were positive. The findings suggested that specific humeral
immune response to ECM1 may be involved in the etiology of lichen
sclerosis and may offer help in disease diagnosis, monitoring, and
approaches to treatment.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Smits et al. (1997) mapped the
ECM1 gene to 1q21 outside the epidermal differentiation complex region
(see 152445). Bhalerao et al. (1995) mapped the gene to mouse chromosome
3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Lipoid proteinosis, also known as hyalinosis cutis et mucosae or
Urbach-Wiethe disease (247100), is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder
typified by generalized thickening of skin, mucosae, and certain
viscera. Classic features include beaded eyelid papules and laryngeal
infiltration leading to hoarseness. Histologically, there is widespread
deposition of hyaline (glycoprotein) material and
disruption/reduplication of basement membrane. Using DNA from 6
consanguineous families, Hamada et al. (2002) mapped the disorder to
chromosome 1q21 at marker D1S498 (lod = 21.85 at theta = 0), within a
2.3-cM critical region. Using a candidate gene approach, the authors
identified 6 different homozygous loss-of-function mutations in ECM1.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
LIPOID PROTEINOSIS OF URBACH AND WIETHE
ECM1, 1-BP DEL, 1019A

In affected individuals of a consanguineous Kuwaiti family with lipoid
proteinosis (247100), Hamada et al. (2002) identified homozygosity for a
single-basepair deletion (A1019) in exon 7 of the ECM1 gene. The
mutation resulted in a premature stop codon 108 bp downstream.

ECM1, GLN346TER

Hamada et al. (2002) identified a 14-year old Pakistani boy with lipoid
proteinosis (247100); he was the product of a consanguineous mating, and
was homozygous for a C-to-T transition at position 1036 in exon 7 of the
ECM1 gene. The mutation resulted in conversion of codon gln346 to a
premature stop codon (Q346X).

ECM1, 1163-BP DEL

Hamada et al. (2002) reported 4 sibs affected with lipoid proteinosis
(247100) within a consanguineous Saudi family. All affected individuals
were homozygous for an 1163-bp deletion in the ECM1 gene, which
eliminated part of intron 8 and all of exons 9 and 10.

In 2 unrelated subjects with lipoid proteinosis (247100) with different
ECM1 haplotypes, Hamada et al. (2003) identified a 507delT mutation in
exon 6 of the ECM1 gene. The authors suggested that the deletion, which
causes a frameshift and premature termination 23 bp downstream, may
represent a recurrent mutation in lipoid proteinosis.

609025	TITLE *609025 KERATIN 75; KRT75
;;KERATIN 6, HAIR FOLLICLE; K6HF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By 5-prime and 3-prime RACE of anagen hair follicle cDNA, Winter et al.
(1998) cloned K6HF. The deduced 551-amino acid protein shares about 80%
homology with cytokeratin KRT5 (148040). In situ hybridization and
indirect immunofluorescence localization showed that K6HF was expressed
exclusively in the companion layer of the hair follicle before KRT17
(148069) and KRT16 (148067).

Wojcik et al. (2001) cloned mouse K6hf. The deduced 551-amino acid
protein shares 84.8% identity with human K6HF.

GENE FUNCTION

Wojcik et al. (2001) found that K6hf assembled into a keratin network
following transfection of kangaroo rat kidney epithelial cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rogers et al. (2000) determined that the K6HF gene spans 17.4 kb.

MAPPING

By screening an arrayed PAC DNA library, Rogers et al. (2000) mapped the
K6HF gene to a region of chromosome 12q13 that flanks a series of hair
keratin genes and pseudogenes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Winter et al. (2004) identified a nonsynonymous SNP in the KRT75 gene
(A12T; 609025.0001) that was significantly associated with the
development of pseudofolliculitis barbae (612318).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PSEUDOFOLLICULITIS BARBAE, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
KRT75, ALA12THR

In 2 affected members of a Caucasian family with pseudofolliculitis
barbae (612318), Winter et al. (2004) identified a heterozygous G-to-A
transition in the KRT75 gene, resulting in an ala12-to-thr (A12T)
substitution in the 1A alpha-helical subdomain of KRT75. The mutation
was also present in an unaffected female relative who had straight hair
and did not shave regularly. In a larger group of 200 individuals,
Winter et al. (2004) found that the A12T SNP was present in 9% of
individuals without the disorder and 35% with the disorder, which was a
significant association (p less than 6 x 10(-6)). The incidence of the
A12T substitution in the investigated population was approximately 3
times higher in African Americans compared to Caucasians (36.7% vs
10.9%). Computer modeling showed that the A12T substitution occurred in
an external position on the surface of the coiled-coil domain and did
not affected the ability of alpha-helical structures to assemble in
parallel. However, in vitro expression studies showed that the variant
was disruptive at later stages, compromising the aggregation of keratin
molecules into intermediate filaments. Winter et al. (2004) postulated
that the A12T SNP destabilizes the mechanical integrity of companion
cells in the hair shaft, which may compromise the ability of the shaft
to move within the skin surface.

608420	TITLE *608420 PANNEXIN 1; PANX1
;;PX1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Bruzzone et al. (2003) cloned Panx1 from a rat hippocampus cDNA library.
The deduced 48-kD protein contains 4 transmembrane domains and
cytoplasmic N and C termini. Northern blot analysis detected Panx1
expression in rat eye, thyroid, prostate, kidney, liver, and central
nervous system. In situ hybridization showed Pnx1 expression in several
brain regions, including cortex, striatum, olfactory bulb, hippocampus,
thalamus, and cerebellum.

GENE FUNCTION

By functional expression in Xenopus oocytes, Bruzzone et al. (2003)
found that rat Pnx1 could support large, voltage-activated outward
currents. With coexpression of rat Panx2 (608421), the Panx1 currents
were reduced. In paired oocytes, Panx1 induced the formation of
intercellular channels with characteristics of gap junctions.

Erythrocytes do not form gap junctions, but Locovei et al. (2006) found
that human erythrocytes expressed pannexin-1. Pannexin-1 formed
mechanosensitive ATP-permeable channels in erythrocytes, and ATP release
by erythrocytes was attenuated by a gap junction blocker. Under
conditions of ATP release, erythrocytes took up tracer molecules
permeant to gap junction channels.

Thompson et al. (2008) noted that PANX1 is expressed at postsynaptic
sites in pyramidal neurons, suggesting that these hemichannels
contribute to dendritic signals associated with synaptic function. The
authors found that, in pyramidal neurons, NMDAR (138249) activation
induced a secondary prolonged current and dye efflux that were blocked
with a specific inhibitory peptide against PANX1 hemichannels. Knockdown
of PANX1 by RNA interference blocked the secondary current in cultured
neurons. Enhancing endogenous NMDAR activation in brain slices by
removing external magnesium ions triggered epileptiform activity, which
had decreased spike amplitude and prolonged interburst interval during
application of the PANX1-blocking peptide. Thompson et al. (2008)
concluded that PANX1 hemichannel opening is triggered by NMDAR
stimulation and can contribute to epileptiform seizure activity.

Apoptotic cells release 'find-me' signals at the earliest stages of
death to recruit phagocytes. Chekeni et al. (2010) identified the plasma
membrane channel PANX1 as a mediator of find-me signal/nucleotide
release from apoptotic cells. Pharmacologic inhibition and
siRNA-mediated knockdown of PANX1 led to decreased nucleotide release
and monocyte recruitment by apoptotic cells. Conversely, PANX1
overexpression enhanced nucleotide release from apoptotic cells and
phagocyte recruitment. Patch-clamp recordings showed that PANX1 was
basally inactive, and that induction of PANX1 currents occurred only
during apoptosis. Mechanistically, PANX1 itself was a target of the
effector caspases CASP3 (600636) and CASP7 (601761), and a specific
caspase cleavage site within PANX1 was essential for PANX1 function
during apoptosis. Expression of truncated PANX1 (at the putative caspase
cleavage site) resulted in a constitutively open channel. PANX1 was also
important for the 'selective' plasma membrane permeability of early
apoptotic cells to specific dyes. Collectively, Chekeni et al. (2010)
concluded that their data identified PANX1 as a plasma membrane channel
mediating the regulated release of find-me signals and selective plasma
membrane permeability during apoptosis, and a novel mechanism of PANX1
activation by caspases.

Karatas et al. (2013) described a signaling pathway between stressed
neurons and trigeminal afferents during cortical spreading depression
(CSD), the putative cause of migraine aura and headache (see 157300).
CSD caused neuronal PANX1 megachannel opening and CASP1 (147678)
activation followed by high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1; 163905) release
from neurons and nuclear factor kappa-B (NFKB; see 164011) activation in
astrocytes. Suppression of this cascade abolished CSD-induced
trigeminovascular activation, dural mast cell degranulation, and
headache. CSD-induced neuronal megachannel opening may promote sustained
activation of trigeminal afferents via parenchymal inflammatory cascades
reaching glia limitans. Karatas et al. (2013) suggested that this
pathway may function to alarm an organism with headache when neurons are
stressed.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PANX1
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP RH11012).

614601	TITLE *614601 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 326; ZNF326
;;ZINC FINGER PROTEIN INTERACTING WITH NUCLEAR MESSENGER RIBONUCLEOPROTEINS
AND DBC1; ZIRD
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ZNF326 is a subunit of a protein complex that regulates alternative mRNA
splicing (Close et al., 2012).

CLONING

By mass spectrometric analysis of proteins that copurified with
messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) particles from HEK293 cells, Close et
al. (2012) identified ZNF326, which they called ZIRD. By SDS-PAGE, ZIRD
had an apparent molecular mass of about 95 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Close et al. (2012) identified ZIRD and DBC1 (KIAA1967; 607359) as
subunits of an approximately 800-kD protein complex that they named the
ZIRD-DBC1 (DBIRD) complex. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis of transfected
HEK293 cells revealed that ZIRD and DBC1 interacted directly. The 2
proteins also interacted directly with RNA polymerase II (see POLR2A;
180660) and with mRNPs, although the interaction with mRNPs depended
upon the presence of RNA. Depletion of ZIRD via RNA interference led to
increased exon inclusion in more than 2,800 cases, whereas exon
exclusion was observed in only 390 cases. Depletion of DBC1 led to exon
inclusion in 796 cases, most of which were also observed following ZIRD
depletion. The effect of ZIRD or DBC1 depletion occurred at the level of
alternative splicing. RNA immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed that
the DBIRD complex bound to relevant exons in mRNAs from 7 tested genes.
The exons affected by DBIRD tended to be AT rich. Depletion of either
DBC1 or ZIRD slowed the rate of transcript elongation and RNA polymerase
II density. Close et al. (2012) concluded that the DBIRD complex affects
the efficiency of splicing, possibly by facilitating transcript
elongation across AT-rich regions and favoring exon inclusion.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the ZNF326 gene to chromosome 1p22.2 based on an
alignment of the ZNF326 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC014899) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

605117	TITLE *605117 SUPPRESSOR OF CYTOKINE SIGNALING 2; SOCS2
;;STAT-INDUCED STAT INHIBITOR 2; SSI2; STATI2;;
CYTOKINE-INDUCIBLE SH2 PROTEIN 2; CIS2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SOCS proteins, such as SOCS2, negatively regulate cytokine receptor
signaling via the Janus kinase (see 147795)/signal transducer and
activation of transcription (STAT; see 600555) pathway (the JAK/STAT
pathway) (Minamoto et al., 1997).

CLONING

By a computer-aided homology search of sequence databases, Minamoto et
al. (1997) identified a partial sequence of SSI2, a member of the SSI
(STAT-induced STAT inhibitor) gene family. They isolated an SSI2 cDNA
from a Jurkat cDNA library. SSI2 encodes a protein of 198 amino acids.
The deduced amino acid sequences of human SSI2 and SSI3 (604176) share
significant homology with human and mouse SSI1 (SOCS1; 603597) and mouse
Cis (602441) at the C-terminal region as well as in the SH2 domain.
Northern blot analysis revealed strong expression of SSI2 in heart,
placenta, lung, kidney, and prostate.

On the basis of an EST database search, Masuhara et al. (1997)
identified SOCS2, which they called CIS2. They found that a C-terminal
40-amino acid region, designated the CIS homology (CH) domain, and the
SH2 domain are highly conserved in the CIS genes, while the respective
N-terminal regions of these proteins share little similarity.

Dey et al. (1998) identified SOCS2 based on its interaction with the
cytoplasmic domain of insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF1R;
147370) in a yeast 2-hybrid screen. They cloned a full-length SOCS2 cDNA
by 5-prime RACE PCR of a human fetal brain cDNA library. Northern blot
analysis demonstrated expression of SOCS2 in many human fetal and adult
tissues, with particular abundance in fetal kidney and adult heart,
skeletal muscle, pancreas, and liver.

GENE FUNCTION

Minamoto et al. (1997) found that SSI2 expression was induced by
cytokine stimulation, and its forced expression in the mouse myeloid
leukemia cell line M1 suppressed the apoptotic affects of LIF (159540)
similarly to SSI1.

Dey et al. (1998) found that the human SOCS2 protein interacted strongly
with the activated IGF1R and not with a kinase-negative mutant receptor
in yeast 2-hybrid assays. Mutation of receptor tyrosines 950, 1250,
1251, and 1316 to phenylalanine or deletion of the C-terminal 93 amino
acids did not result in decreased interaction of the receptor with human
SOCS2 protein. SOCS2 interacted with IGF1R both in vitro and in vivo.
Dey et al. (1998) concluded that their results raised the possibility
that SOCS proteins may play a regulatory role in IGF1 receptor
signaling.

Machado et al. (2006) showed that lipoxin A4 (LXA4) activated 2
receptors in mouse splenic dendritic cells, Ahr (600253) and Lxar
(FPRL1; 136538), and that this activation triggered Socs2.
Socs2-deficient mouse dendritic cells were hyperresponsive to microbial
stimuli and were refractory to the inhibitory action of LXA4, but not
Il10 (124092). Upon infection with an intracellular pathogen,
Socs2-deficient mice had uncontrolled production of proinflammatory
cytokines, decreased microbial proliferation, aberrant leukocyte
infiltration, and elevated mortality. Machado et al. (2006) also showed
that Socs2 was a crucial intracellular mediator of the antiinflammatory
actions of aspirin-induced lipoxins in vivo.

GENE STRUCTURE

Metcalf et al. (2000) demonstrated that the mouse SOCS2 gene is composed
of 3 exons and 2 introns.

MAPPING

By cytogenetic and radiation hybrid mapping, Yandava et al. (1999)
mapped the SOCS2 gene to chromosome 12q21.3-q23.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Kato et al. (2006) performed a region-wide association analysis on
12q15-q22 using more than 500 SNPs in 1,492 unrelated Japanese
individuals and identified an association between type II diabetes
(125853) and a 13.6-kb haplotype block that includes the entire SOCS2
gene. Five SNPs in the 5-prime region of the SOCS2 gene were
significantly associated with type II diabetes. Kato et al. (2006)
concluded that SOCS2 may play a role in susceptibility to type II
diabetes in the Japanese.

ANIMAL MODEL

Metcalf et al. (2000) generated mice deficient in Socs2 by targeted
disruption. Socs2-deficient mice were indistinguishable from their
littermates until weaning at 3 weeks of age, but subsequently grew more
rapidly. Socs2 -/- adult males were on average 40% heavier than wildtype
littermates. Adult Socs2 +/- males exhibited an intermediate body
weight. Increased growth was also significant but less marked in female
Socs2 -/- mice. Adult Socs2 -/- females typically attained the weight of
wildtype male mice, but heterozygous Socs2 females were not
significantly heavier than sex-matched wildtype littermates. Neither
male nor female Socs2 -/- mice accumulated significantly more fatty
tissue than wildtype mice. Rather, increased body weight in these mice
resulted from an increase in the weight of most visceral organs.
Sexually dimorphic or male-specific organs were not disproportionately
enlarged. Carcass weight was also significantly increased, indicating
that muscle and bone may contribute significantly to the increased size
of Socs2-deficient mice. There was significant increase in long bone
length. Tail length was normal. The increase in size was due to elevated
cell numbers rather than increased cell size. Metcalf et al. (2000)
observed a marked thickening of the dermis associated with excessive
collagen accumulation in all of 7 males, and less prominently in 6 of 8
female Socs2 -/- mice. Collagen deposition was also increased around the
bronchi and vessels of the lungs of 6 of the 9 male, but only 3 of 10
female, Socs2-deficient mice. No hematologic abnormalities were
observed. The characteristics of Socs2 -/- mice were similar to those of
mice with growth hormone (GH; 139250) excess and IGF1 (147440) excess.
Characteristics of deregulated growth hormone and IGF1 signaling,
including decreased production of major urinary protein, increased local
IGF1 production, and collagen accumulation in the dermis were observed
in Socs2-deficient mice, indicating that Socs2 may have an essential
negative regulatory role in the growth hormone/IGF1 pathway.

Turnley et al. (2002) studied the role of Socs2 in mouse neural
development. They found that Socs2 was expressed by mouse progenitor
cells and neurons in response to LIF-like cytokines. Progenitor cells
lacking Socs2 produced fewer neurons and more astrocytes in vitro. Socs2
-/- mice had fewer neurons and neurogenin-1 (NGN1; 601726)-expressing
cells in the developing cortex, whereas overexpression of Socs2
increased neuronal differentiation. Turnley et al. (2002) found that GH
inhibited Ngn1 expression and neuronal production, and this action was
blocked by Socs2 overexpression. They speculated that Socs2 promotes
neuronal differentiation by blocking GH-mediated downregulation of Ngn1.

Using GH-deficient Socs2 -/- mice, Greenhalgh et al. (2005) demonstrated
that the Socs2 -/- phenotype is dependent upon the presence of
endogenous GH. Treatment with exogenous GH induced excessive growth in
terms of overall body weight, body and bone lengths, and the weight of
internal organs and tissues. Microarray analysis on liver RNA extracts
after exogenous GH administration revealed a heightened response to GH.
The conserved C-terminal SOCS-box motif was essential for all inhibitory
function. SOCS2 was found to bind 2 phosphorylated tyrosines on the GH
receptor (600946), and mutation analysis of these amino acids showed
that both were essential for SOCS2 function. Greenhalgh et al. (2005)
concluded that SOCS2 is a negative regulator of GH signaling.

610396	TITLE *610396 TRAFFICKING PROTEIN PARTICLE COMPLEX, SUBUNIT 6A; TRAPPC6A
;;TRAPP COMPLEX, SUBUNIT 6A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TRAPPC6A is a subunit of the TRAPPI and TRAPPII complexes (Gwynn et al.,
2006).

CLONING

Gwynn et al. (2006) cloned mouse Trappc6a, and they identified human
TRAPPC6A by database analysis. Mouse and human TRAPPC6A encode deduced
159-amino acid proteins that share 83% identity and have calculated
molecular masses of 17.4 kD. Both proteins contain 2 motifs conserved in
TRAPPC6B (610397) and several yeast TRAPP subunits, including Trs33, the
putative homolog of TRAPPC6A and TRAPPC6B. Northern blot analysis
detected Trappc6a expression in all mouse tissues examined, with highest
expression in kidney, liver, and testis. Expression of mouse Trappc6a
was higher in cultured melanocytes than in kidney.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gwynn et al. (2006) determined that the mouse Trappc6a gene contains 6
exons.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the
TRAPPC6A gene to chromosome 19 (TMAP RH98840). Gwynn et al. (2006)
mapped the mouse Trappc6a gene to chromosome 7.

ANIMAL MODEL

Gwynn et al. (2006) identified a recessive mutation in mice, designated
'mosaic hypopigmentation' (Mhyp), that caused mosaic loss of coat
pigmentation and patchy loss of pigmentation with abnormal melanosomes
in the retinal pigmented epithelial layer of the eye. They determined
that Mhyp resulted from integration of an 8.4-kb retrovirus into intron
1 of the Trappc6a gene.

120105	TITLE *120105 COLIPASE, PANCREATIC; CLPS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Pancreatic colipase is a 12-kD polypeptide cofactor for pancreatic
lipase (EC 3.1.1.3; 246600), an enzyme essential for the absorption of
dietary long-chain triglyceride fatty acids. Colipase is thought to
anchor lipase noncovalently to the surface of lipid micelles,
counteracting the destabilizing influence of intestinal bile salts
(summary by Davis et al., 1991).

CLONING

Using primers derived from the known amino acid sequence, Davis et al.
(1991) employed the PCR to produce a cDNA clone corresponding to the
complete coding region of the human procolipase mRNA.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sims and Lowe (1992) found that the CLPS gene has 3 exons and that the
5-prime-flanking region contains a TATA box, a GC box, and a 28-bp
region with homology to the rat pancreatic-specific enhancer.

MAPPING

By the study of mouse/human somatic cell hybrids, Davis et al. (1991)
determined that the CLPS gene is located in the region 6pter-p21.1.

Sims and Lowe (1992) confirmed the assignment of the CLPS gene to
chromosome 6 by blots of hamster-human somatic cell hybrid DNA using the
entire colipase cDNA.

ANIMAL MODEL

Zhang et al. (2006) reported a mechanism by which constant darkness
regulates the gene expression of fat catabolic enzymes in mice. Genes
for murine procolipase (Clps) and pancreatic lipase-related protein-2
(Plrp2; 604423) are activated in a circadian manner in peripheral organs
during 12-hour dark:12-hour dark (DD) but not light-dark (LD) cycles.
This mechanism is deregulated in circadian-deficient Per1/Per2 double
mutant mice. Zhang et al. (2006) identified circadian-regulated
5-prime-AMP, which is elevated in the blood of DD mice, as a key
mediator of this response. Synthetic 5-prime-AMP induced torpor (a
hibernation-like state) and murine Clps expression in LD mice. Torpor
induced by metabolic stress was associated with elevated 5-prime-AMP
levels in DD mice. Levels of glucose and nonesterified fatty acid in the
blood were reversed in DD and LD mice. Induction of murine Clps
expression by 5-prime-AMP in LD mice was reciprocally linked to blood
glucose levels. Zhang et al. (2006) concluded that their findings
uncovered a circadian metabolic rhythm in mammals.

610330	TITLE *610330 RIBONUCLEASE H2, SUBUNIT C; RNASEH2C
;;AYP1;;
FLJ20974
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The RNASEH2C gene encodes subunit C of the human ribonuclease H2 enzyme
complex which cleaves ribonucleotides from RNA:DNA duplexes. See also
RNASEH2A (606034) and RNASEH2B (610326).

CLONING

The RNASEH2C gene encodes a 164-amino acid protein (Crow et al., 2006).

GENE STRUCTURE

The RNASEH2C gene contains 4 exons (Crow et al., 2006).

MAPPING

The RNASEH2C gene maps to chromosome 11q13.2 (Crow et al., 2006).

GENE FUNCTION

By transient expression in HEK293T cells, Crow et al. (2006) showed that
the human RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, and RNASEH2C genes interact with each
other and form an enzymatic protein complex with RNase H2 activity. The
complex was able to recognize and cleave a single ribonucleotide
embedded in a DNA-DNA complex.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 5 Pakistani families with Aicardi-Goutieres
syndrome-3 (AGS3; 610329), Crow et al. (2006) identified a homozygous
mutation in the RNASH2C gene (610330.0001). Haplotype analysis suggested
a founder effect. Affected members of a Pakistani family carried another
homozygous mutation (610330.0002).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
AICARDI-GOUTIERES SYNDROME 3
RNASEH2C, ARG69TRP

In affected members of 5 consanguineous Pakistani families with
Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome-3 (610329), Crow et al. (2006) identified a
homozygous 205C-T transition in exon 2 of the RNASH2C gene, resulting in
an arg69-to-trp (R69W) substitution. Haplotype analysis suggested a
founder effect.

Rice et al. (2007) found this mutation on a common haplotype in 13
families of Pakistani origin.

.0002
AICARDI-GOUTIERES SYNDROME 3
RNASEH2C, LYS143ILE

In affected members of a consanguineous Bangladeshi family with AGS3
(610329), Crow et al. (2006) identified a homozygous 428A-T transition
in exon 3 of the RNASEH2C gene, resulting in a lys143-to-ile (K143I)
substitution.

610950	TITLE *610950 SYNAPTOTAGMIN 16; SYT16
;;SYNAPTOTAGMIN 14-RELATED PROTEIN; STREP14
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases for sequences encoding synaptotagmin-like C2
domains, Fukuda (2003) identified mouse and human SYT14 (610949) and
SYT16, which they called STREP14. The deduced mouse and human STREP14
proteins contain 639 and 625 amino acids, respectively. Both have
C-terminal C-type tandem C2 domains, but they lack the N-terminal
transmembrane domain found in other synaptotagmins. RT-PCR detected
highest Strep14 expression in mouse heart and testis, with weaker
expression in kidney and lung. In mouse embryos, expression was weak on
day 7 and strong on days 11, 15, and 17.

GENE FUNCTION

Fukuda (2003) found that mouse Strep14 showed relatively weak
homooligomerization and heterooligomerization with Syt14, irrespective
of the presence of Ca(2+). The C2 domains of Strep14 bound liposomes
made up of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Fukuda (2003) mapped the human SYT16 gene
to chromosome 14q23.1 and the mouse Syt16 gene to chromosome 12C3.

177070	TITLE *177070 PROTEIN 4.2, ERYTHROCYTIC; EPB42
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Korsgren et al. (1990) cloned and sequenced protein band 4.2 from a
human reticulocyte cDNA library. The deduced 691-amino acid band 4.2
protein has homology with 2 closely related calcium-dependent
crosslinking proteins, guinea pig liver transglutaminase and the alpha
subunit of human coagulation factor XIII (F13A1; 134570). Within the 5
contiguous consensus residues of the transglutaminase active site, band
4.2 has an amino acid substitution which leads to loss of
transglutaminase activity. Sung et al. (1990) also cloned protein 4.2
and likewise found homology to the 2 transglutaminases, as well as the
lack of the critical residue required for enzymatic crosslinking of
substrates.

Korsgren and Cohen (1991) showed that reticulocytes contain 2 different
sized EPB42 messages; the major, smaller, message is produced by
alternative splicing. They found that the human and murine proteins
share 72% sequence identity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Korsgren and Cohen (1991) showed that the band 4.2 gene is about 20 kb
long and contains 13 exons. Alignment of the band 4.2 amino acid
sequence with that of F13A2 and division of the sequences into exons
showed a remarkable correspondence, and in most cases identity, in the
sizes of the paired exons.

Korsgren and Cohen (1994) found that the organization and size of the
human and mouse EPB42 genes are identical.

MAPPING

Sung et al. (1991) mapped the EPB42 gene to 15q15-q21 by fluorescence in
situ hybridization. Najfeld et al. (1992) assigned the gene to 15q15 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. White et al. (1992) mapped the Epb42
gene to mouse chromosome 2, which shares an extensive segment of
syntenic homology with human chromosome 15.

By long-range genomic PCR, Grenard et al. (2001) mapped the EPB42 gene
to a 100-kb region of 15q15.2, arranged in tandem with 2 other
transglutaminase genes, TGM5 (603805) and TGM7 (606776). By radiation
hybrid analysis, Grenard et al. (2001) mapped the mouse Epb42, Tgm5, and
Tgm7 genes in close proximity on chromosome 2.

GENE FUNCTION

In the red cell membrane skeleton, protein 4.2 may regulate the
association of protein 3 (109270) with ankyrin (612641) (Davies and Lux,
1989).

Azim et al. (1996) demonstrated that both protein 4.2 and dematin
(125305) are ATP-binding proteins.

Bruce et al. (2002) observed that protein 4.2 and CD47 interact in the
human red cell membrane, which provided further evidence for an
association between the band 3 complex (which includes protein 4.2) and
the Rh complex, and defined a point of attachment between the Rh complex
and the red cell cytoskeleton.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 4 unrelated Japanese patients with autosomal recessive hereditary
spherocytosis (612690), Bouhassira et al. (1991, 1992) identified
homozygosity for a mutation in the EPB42 gene (177070.0001).

In a Portuguese woman with recessively transmitted hemolytic anemia,
Hayette et al. (1995) identified a mutation in the EPB42 gene
(177070.0002).

In Tunisian sibs with autosomal recessive hemolytic anemia reported by
Ghanem et al. (1990), Hayette et al. (1995) identified homozygosity for
a mutation in the EPB42 gene (177070.0003).

ANIMAL MODEL

The mouse 'pallid' mutation (see 604310) produces defects in at least 3
subcellular organelles: platelet-dense granules, melanosomes, and kidney
lysosomes. White et al. (1992) noted that the mouse Epb42 gene mapped to
the same region as the pallid mutation in the mouse. Prompted to examine
the Epb42 gene in the pallid mouse, they found changes on Southern blot
analysis suggesting a mutation; Northern blot analysis demonstrated
smaller than normal Epb42 transcripts in affected pallid tissues, such
as kidney and skin. However, Gwynn et al. (1997) and White et al. (1997)
excluded Epb42 as a candidate for the mouse pallid mutation. On Northern
blot analysis of normal and pallid mouse kidney, Gwynn et al. (1997)
observed that the truncated Epb42 protein comigrated with normal Epb42
protein. As the pallid mutation originally arose in a wild M. domesticus
mouse, they concluded that the Epb42 protein characteristic of pallid is
a normal polymorphism and that Epb42 and pallid are distinct loci.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPHEROCYTOSIS, TYPE 5, DUE TO PROTEIN 4.2-NIPPON
EPB42, ALA142THR

In 4 unrelated Japanese patients with spherocytosis (612690), Bouhassira
et al. (1991, 1992) identified homozygosity for a G-to-A transition in
the EPB42 gene, resulting in an ala142-to-thr (A142T) substitution. The
abnormality in protein 4.2 results in abnormally shaped and osmotically
fragile RBCs. The mutation occurred in an alternatively spliced exon
that is present in 2 of 4 EPB42 mRNA splicing isoforms. Thus this is a
recessive form of spherocytosis causing hereditary hemolytic anemia.

Iwamoto et al. (1993) identified the same mutation in a 27-year-old
Japanese female with acute hemolytic crisis and in her sister.

Perrotta et al. (1999) described the 4.2-Nippon mutation in a
30-year-old female born in a small mountain village in central Italy.
There was no Japanese ancestry. Splenomegaly and moderate hemolytic
anemia were present from birth.

.0002
SPHEROCYTOSIS, TYPE 5, DUE TO PROTEIN 4.2-LISBOA
EPB42, 1-BP DEL, 264G

Hayette et al. (1995) identified a defect in the EPB42 gene in a
26-year-old Portuguese woman with recessively transmitted hereditary
hemolytic anemia (612690). Protein 4.2 was absent from red cell ghosts
by Western blotting. Nucleotide sequencing disclosed deletion of a
single nucleotide at position 264 (or 265): AAG GTG was changed to AAG
TG in codon 88 (or 89) in exon 2. This change, defining allele 4.2
Lisboa, placed in frame the nonsense TGA triplet that normally overlaps
codons 136 and 137 (GTG ACC). In effect, codon 89 was changed from GTG
(val) to TGA (stop). The mutation was present in homozygous state in the
proband and in heterozygous state in the parents and a brother. Apart
from anemia, the patient was free of clinical manifestations. Hayette et
al. (1995) noted that in this case there were only a few spherocytes and
only a limited decrease in the osmotic resistance.

.0003
SPHEROCYTOSIS, TYPE 5, DUE TO PROTEIN 4.2-TOZEUR
EPB42, ARG310GLN

Using high-sensitivity Western blot analysis, Hayette et al. (1995)
found that the Tunisian sibs with autosomal recessive hemolytic anemia
(612690) originally reported by Ghanem et al. (1990) had trace amounts
of the EPB42 protein. They found that the sibs were homozygous for a
G-to-A transition in exon 7 of the EPB42 gene, resulting in an
arg310-to-gln (R310Q) substitution. The parents were heterozygous for
the mutation, which was absent in 48 control chromosomes of Tunisian
individuals.

.0004
SPHEROCYTOSIS, TYPE 5, DUE TO PROTEIN 4.2-NOTAME
EPB42, IVS6DS, G-A, +1

Protein 4.2 (Notame) was found in a 56-year-old Japanese man being
investigated for chronic hyperbilirubinemia (Matsuda et al., 1995). He
had mild splenomegaly and mild anemia with reticulocytosis as well as
microspherocytosis (612690). Erythrocyte osmotic fragility was
remarkably increased. SDS-PAGE showed complete deficiency of protein
4.2. Direct sequencing and dot-blot hybridization with allele-specific
oligonucleotide probes indicated that the man was a compound
heterozygote for the A142T mutation (177070.0001) and a single
nucleotide substitution (G to A) in the first nucleotide of intron 6 of
the EPB42 gene. RT-PCR analysis using total RNA isolated from
reticulocytes of the proband showed that the intron 6 donor site
mutation caused exon 6 to be spliced out with intron 6. The abnormal
mRNA had a premature termination codon as a result of a frameshift,
which precipitated instability of the protein that led to its
degradation.

.0005
SPHEROCYTOSIS, TYPE 5, DUE TO PROTEIN 4.2-HAMMERSMITH
EPB42, 41-BP DEL, NT1709

Bruce et al. (2002) presented data on a patient of Pakistani origin with
recessive spherocytosis due to absence of protein 4.2 (612690). EPB42
cDNA sequence analysis showed the presence of a 41-bp frameshift
deletion in the 5-prime end of exon 11 of the EPB42 gene that produced a
truncated peptide designated protein 4.2 Hammersmith. Quantitative
RT-PCR indicated that the mutant mRNA was unstable. Sequencing of
genomic DNA showed that the deletion stemmed from aberrant splicing. The
proband was homozygous for a G-to-T substitution at position 1747 that
activated a cryptic acceptor splice site within exon 11 of the EPB42
gene. The proband's mother was heterozygous for this substitution.
Unlike protein 4.2-null mice, the proband's red cells showed no evidence
of abnormal cation permeability. Quantitation of red cell membrane
proteins showed that CD47 (601028) was markedly reduced to about 1% (in
the proband) and 65% (in the mother) of that found in healthy controls.

600264	TITLE *600264 ARGININE VASOPRESSIN RECEPTOR 1B; AVPR1B
;;ANTIDIURETIC HORMONE, RECEPTOR FOR, V1B;;
VASOPRESSIN V1B RECEPTOR;;
PITUITARY VASOPRESSIN RECEPTOR 3; AVPR3
DESCRIPTION The neurohypophyseal hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) induces diverse
actions, including stimulation of hepatic glycogenolysis, contraction of
vascular smooth muscle cells and mesangial cells, antidiuresis in the
kidney, and aggregation of platelets. These actions of AVP are mediated
through specific G protein-coupled receptors. AVP receptors are
classified into at least 3 subtypes: V1a, V1b, and V2. The V1a receptor
(600821) has been localized in the liver, vascular smooth muscle, brain,
mesangial cells, and platelets. The V2 receptor (300538) is exclusively
expressed in the kidney, and defects in this receptor result in
nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Sugimoto et al. (1994) cloned the V1b
receptor from a cDNA library of human pituitary. (The gene is also
referred to as AVPR3.) AVP modulates the release of ACTH,
beta-endorphin, and prolactin from the anterior pituitary. Release is
mediated by the V1b receptor through the mobilization of intracellular
Ca(2+) by phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis. The deduced 424-amino acid
sequence of the V1b receptor had highest overall homology with the V1a,
V2, and oxytocin receptors, with homologies of 45, 39, and 45%,
respectively. Expressed in COS-1 cells, V1b had a single binding site
for AVP. It bound various agonists and antagonists of vasopressin with
affinities distinct from those of V1a and V2 receptors but consistent
with those anticipated for the V1b receptor on the basis of
pharmacologic studies.

The AVPR1B gene was also cloned by de Keyzer et al. (1994), who referred
to it as AVPR3. Rousseau-Merck et al. (1995) mapped the gene to 1q32 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

Birnbaumer (2000) noted that the biologic effects of AVP are mediated by
3 receptor subtypes: the V1A and V1B receptors that activate
phospholipases via Gq/11, and the V2 receptor that activates adenylyl
cyclase by interacting with GS. Isolation of the cDNAs encoding the V1A
and V1B receptor subtypes explained the tissue variability of V1
antagonist binding, whereas identification of the cDNA and gene encoding
the V2 receptor provided the information to identify the mutations
responsible for X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (304800).
Mutations that abrogate the production and/or release of AVP from the
pituitary have diabetes insipidus as their most dramatic manifestation,
indicating that the maintenance of water homeostasis is the most
important physiologic role of this neuropeptide.

The pituitary V3 vasopressin receptor was used by de Keyzer et al.
(1996) to analyze the corticotroph phenotype of secreting bronchial
carcinoids associated with the ectopic ACTH syndrome. Ectopic ACTH
secretion occurs in highly differentiated and rather indolent tumors
such as bronchial carcinoids or, in contrast, in various types of
aggressive and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine tumors. They found
that in 6 of 8 bronchial carcinoids responsible for the ectopic ACTH
syndrome, both proopiomelanocortin (176830) and the V3 receptor gene
were expressed at the same level as they are in ACTH-secreting pituitary
adenomas; in contrast, no POMC expression and only very faint V3
receptor expression were detected in 6 of 8 nonsecreting bronchial
carcinoids.

ANIMAL MODEL

Wersinger et al. (2002) found that mice with a targeted disruption of
the V1br gene, which is expressed in brain, exhibited marked reduction
in aggression and modest impairment in social recognition. The mice
performed normally in all other behaviors examined, including sexual
behavior, suggesting that reduced aggression and social memory are not
simply the results of a global deficit in sensorimotor function or
motivation. Wersinger et al. (2002) suggested that V1br antagonists may
be useful for the treatment of aggressive behaviors.

Tanoue et al. (2004) investigated the functional role of the V1b
receptor in vivo by using gene targeting to create a mouse model lacking
the V1br gene. Under resting conditions, circulating concentrations of
ACTH and corticosterone were lower in the null mice compared with
wildtype mice. The normal increase in circulating ACTH levels in
response to exogenous administration of AVP was impaired in the null
mice, whereas corticotropin-releasing hormone-stimulated ACTH release
was not impaired. The increase in ACTH after a forced swim stress was
significantly suppressed in the null mice. The results demonstrated that
the V1b receptor plays a crucial role in regulating
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity. It does this by
maintaining ACTH and corticosterone levels, not only under stress but
also under basal conditions.

609827	TITLE *609827 PELLINO, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 3; PELI3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Toll-like receptors (TLRs; see 603030) and IL1R (IL1R1; 147810) are part
of the innate immune response aimed at mobilizing defense mechanisms in
response in infection or injury. Pellino proteins, such as PELI3, are
intermediate components in the signaling cascades initiated by TLRs and
IL1R (Jensen and Whitehead, 2003).

CLONING

By searching for sequences similar to PELI1 (614797) and PELI2 (614798),
followed by 3-prime RACE, Jensen and Whitehead (2003) cloned 2 splice
variants of PELI3, which they called PELI3-alpha and PELI3-beta. The
deduced 469-amino acid PELI3-alpha protein contains 24 amino acids
encoded by exon 3 that are absent in the 445-amino acid PELI3-beta
protein. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.5-kb transcript expressed
at high levels in brain, heart, and testis, and at lower levels in
kidney, liver, lung, placenta, small intestine, spleen, and stomach.
RT-PCR, but not Northern blot analysis, also showed PELI3 expression in
muscle and colon.

GENE FUNCTION

Jensen and Whitehead (2003) found that PELI3 interacted directly with
IL1R-associated kinase-1 (IRAK1; 300283), TNF receptor-associated
factor-6 (TRAF6; 602355), TNF-beta-activated kinase-1 (TAK1, or MAP3K7;
602614), and NFKB-inducing kinase (NIK, or MAP3K14; 604655) in an IL1
(see IL1A; 147760)-dependent manner. In reporter gene assays, PELI3
activated JUN (165160) and ELK1 (311040), but not NFKB (see 164011).
Jensen and Whitehead (2003) concluded that PELI3 plays a role in the
innate immune response and may be a scaffolding protein.

Butler et al. (2005) found that both isoforms of PELI3 could induce
expression of a reporter gene dependent on p38 MAPK (MAPK14; 600289)
activation in human embryonic kidney cells. Activation of p38 MAPK by
PELI3 coincided with binding of PELI3 to IRAK1. TRAF6 and TAK1 were
identified as downstream mediators of p38 MAPK activation by PELI3.
PELI3 promoted translocation of the p38 MAPK substrate, MAPK-activated
protein kinase-2 (MAPKAPK2; 602006), from the nucleus to the cytoplasm
and activated the transcription factor CREB (123810) in a p38
MAPK-dependent manner.

GENE STRUCTURE

Jensen and Whitehead (2003) determined that the PELI3 gene contains 8
exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Jensen and Whitehead (2003) mapped the
PELI3 gene to chromosome 11.

603732	TITLE *603732 CRYPTOCHROME 2; CRY2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Hsu et al. (1996) identified a human gene, CRY2, whose product had 73%
amino acid identity to the human (6-4)photolyase (CRY1; 601933). The
CRY2 protein shares 51% amino acid sequence identity to Drosophila
(6-4)photolyase. Hsu et al. (1996) purified the human CRY1 and CRY2
proteins and characterized them as maltose-binding fusion proteins that
contain FAD and a pterin cofactor. Both CRY1 and CRY2 proteins lacked
photolyase activity. Hsu et al. (1996) concluded that these proteins are
not photolyases, but may function as blue-light photoreceptors in
humans.

As part of a search for human brain cDNA clones with the potential to
encode large proteins in vitro, Ishikawa et al. (1998) independently
identified CRY2. The CRY2 open reading frame encodes a protein of 589
amino acids with an apparent molecular mass of 67 kD.

Kobayashi et al. (1998) isolated and characterized mouse Cry1 and Cry2.
While Cry1 is localized to the mitochondria, Cry2 is found mainly in the
nucleus. The C termini of both mouse Cry2 and human CRY2 each contain a
nuclear localization signal, and the N terminus of mouse Cry1 contains a
mitochondrial transport signal. Cry1 protein bound tightly to DNA
Sepharose, while Cry2 protein did not.

GENE FUNCTION

Griffin et al. (1999) showed that human CRY1 and CRY2 act as
light-independent inhibitors of a heterodimeric activator consisting of
CLOCK (601851) and BMAL1 (602550), the activator driving Per1 (602260)
transcription, very likely by means of direct contacts between CRY1 and
BMAL1 and between CRY2 and CLOCK. They concluded that CRY1 and CRY2
occupy a central position within the mammalian circadian clock,
virtually at the interface between CLOCK-BMAL1 and PER1, PER2 (603426),
and TIM (603887). Griffin et al. (1999) suggested that Drosophila CRY
exemplifies the ancestral role of the photoreceptor acting as a
light-dependent regulator of the circadian feedback loop, whereas
mammalian CRYs have preserved the role within the circadian feedback
loop but have shed their direct photoreceptor function.

Kume et al. (1999) determined that the mouse Cry1 and Cry2 genes act in
the negative limb of the clock feedback loop. They stated that mouse
Cry1 and Cry2 are nuclear proteins that interact with each of the Per
proteins, translocate each Per protein from cytoplasm to nucleus, and
are rhythmically expressed in the suprachiasmatic circadian clock.
Luciferase reporter gene assays showed that Cry1 or Cry2 alone abrogates
Clock/Bmal1 (602550) E box-mediated transcription. The mouse Per and Cry
proteins appeared to inhibit the transcriptional complex differentially.

Etchegaray et al. (2003) demonstrated that transcriptional regulation of
the core clock mechanism in mouse liver is accompanied by rhythms in H3
histone (see 602810) acetylation, and that H3 acetylation is a potential
target of the inhibitory action of Cry. The promoter regions of the
Per1, Per2, and Cry1 genes exhibited circadian rhythms in H3 acetylation
and RNA polymerase II (see 180660) binding that were synchronous with
the corresponding steady-state mRNA rhythms. The histone
acetyltransferase p300 (602700) precipitated with Clock in vivo in a
time-dependent manner. Moreover, the Cry proteins inhibited a
p300-induced increase in Clock/Bmal1-mediated transcription. Etchegaray
et al. (2003) concluded that the delayed timing of the Cry1 mRNA rhythm,
relative to the Per rhythms, was due to the coordinated activities of
Rev-Erb-alpha (602408) and Clock/Bmal1, and defined a novel mechanism
for circadian phase control.

Lamia et al. (2011) showed that 2 circadian coregulators, Cry1 (601933)
and Cry2, interact with glucocorticoid receptor (138040) in a
ligand-dependent fashion and globally alter the transcriptional response
to glucocorticoids in mouse embryonic fibroblasts: cryptochrome
deficiency vastly decreases gene repression and approximately doubles
the number of dexamethasone-induced genes, suggesting that cryptochromes
broadly oppose glucocorticoid receptor activation and promote
repression. In mice, genetic loss of Cry1 and/or 2 results in glucose
intolerance and constitutively high levels of circulating
corticosterone, suggesting reduced suppression of the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis coupled with increased
glucocorticoid transactivation in the liver. Genomically, Cry1 and Cry2
associate with a glucocorticoid response element in the
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase-1 (PCK1; 614168) promoter in a
hormone-dependent manner, and dexamethasone-induced transcription of the
Pck1 gene was strikingly increased in cryptochrome-deficient livers.
Lamia et al. (2011) concluded that their results revealed a specific
mechanism through which cryptochromes couple the activity of clock and
receptor target genes to complex genomic circuits underpinning normal
metabolic homeostasis.

In mammals, PERIOD (PER1; 602260 and PER2; 603426) and CRYPTOCHROME
(CRY1 and CRY2) proteins accumulate, form a large nuclear complex (PER
complex), and repress their own transcription. Padmanabhan et al. (2012)
found that mouse PER complexes included RNA helicases DDX5 (180630) and
DHX9 (603115), active RNA polymerase II large subunit (180660), Per and
Cry pre-mRNAs, and SETX (608465), a helicase that promotes
transcriptional termination. During circadian negative feedback, RNA
polymerase II accumulated near termination sites on Per and Cry genes
but not on control genes. Recruitment of PER complexes to the elongating
polymerase at Per and Cry termination sites inhibited SETX action,
impeding RNA polymerase II release and thereby repressing
transcriptional reinitiation. Circadian clock negative feedback thus
includes direct control of transcriptional termination.

MAPPING

Kobayashi et al. (1998) mapped the mouse Cry1 and Cry2 genes to
chromosomes 10C and 2E, respectively. Using a GeneBridge 4 radiation
hybrid panel, Ishikawa et al. (1998) mapped the human CRY2 gene to
chromosome 11.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Xing et al. (2013) reported the crystal structures of mammalian CRY2 in
its apo, FAD-bound, and FBXL3 (605653)-SKP1 (601434)-complexed forms.
Distinct from other cryptochromes, mammalian CRY2 binds FAD dynamically
with an open cofactor pocket. Notably, the F-box protein FBXL3 captures
CRY2 by simultaneously occupying its FAD-binding pocket with a conserved
carboxy-terminal tail and burying its PER-binding interface.

ANIMAL MODEL

Van der Horst et al. (1999) disrupted the Cry1 and Cry2 genes in mice.
Homozygous Cry1 -/-, Cry2 -/-, and double-mutant mice had normal 24-hour
circadian rhythms when exposed to 12h/12h light/dark cycles. In total
darkness, Cry1 -/- mice had a faster running clock (22.51 +/- 0.06h, P =
0.00001) than wildtype mice, while Cry2 -/- mice had a slower clock
(24.63 +/- 0.06 hours, P = 0.00001). Double-mutant mice in total
darkness showed a striking instantaneous and complete arrhythmicity,
indicating the absence of an internal circadian clock. The 'clock'
mutant mouse differs in showing a more gradual onset of arrhythmicity.
Mice with only 1 copy of wildtype Cry2 displayed a free-running rhythm
even shorter than that of Cry1 knockouts, which gradually progressed
into arrhythmicity. Once returned to a light/dark cycle, the normal
24-hour period resumed. Mice with only one functional allele of Cry1
showed rhythmic activity with a period intermediate to those of Cry1 -/-
and Cry2 -/- mice. The authors concluded that their results demonstrated
that the Cry proteins are involved in maintaining period length and
circadian rhythmicity, and that a critical balance between Cry1 and Cry2
is required for proper clock functioning.

Thresher et al. (1998) disrupted the mouse Cry2 gene by homologous
recombination. The mutant mice had lowered sensitivity to acute light
induction of the Per1 gene in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), but
exhibited normal circadian oscillations of Per1 and Cry1 mRNA in the
SCN. Behaviorally, the mutants had an intrinsic circadian period about 1
hour longer than normal and exhibited high amplitude phase shifts in
response to light pulses administered at circadian time 17. The authors
considered these data consistent with the hypothesis that Cry2 protein
modulates circadian responses in mice and suggested that cryptochromes
have a role in circadian photoreception in mammals.

Freedman et al. (1999) studied circadian behavior in mice deficient in
both rods and cones. These mice maintained a light-entrained circadian
rhythm, which they lost with enucleation. Lucas et al. (1999) studied
pineal melatonin secretion in mice lacking both rods and cones. There
was normal suppression of pineal melatonin in response to monochromatic
light of wavelength 509 nm. These authors concluded that mammals have
additional ocular photoreceptors which they use in the regulation of
temporal physiology, and suggested CRY1 and CRY2 as candidates.

Okamura et al. (1999) demonstrated that, in mice lacking Cry1 and Cry2,
cyclic expression of the clock genes Per1 and Per2 is abolished in the
suprachiasmatic nucleus and peripheral tissues and that Per1 and Per2
mRNA levels are constitutively high. These findings indicated that the
biologic clock is eliminated in the absence of both Cry1 and Cry2 and
supported the idea that mammalian CRY proteins act in the negative limb
of the circadian feedback loop. The Cry double mutant mice retained the
ability to have Per1 and Per2 expression induced by a brief light
stimulus known to phase-shift the biologic clock in wildtype animals.
Thus, Cry1 and Cry2 are dispensable for light-induced phase shifting of
the biologic clock.

Shearman et al. (2000) demonstrated that in the mouse, the core
mechanism for the master circadian clock consists of interacting
positive and negative transcription and translation feedback loops.
Analysis of Clock/Clock mutant mice, homozygous Per2 mutants, and
Cry-deficient mice revealed substantially altered Bmal1 rhythms,
consistent with a dominant role of Per2 in the positive regulation of
the Bmal1 loop. In vitro analysis of Cry inhibition of
Clock:Bmal1-mediated transcription shows that the inhibition is through
direct protein-protein interactions, independent of the Per and Tim
proteins. Per2 is a positive regulator of the Bmal1 loop, and Cry1 and
Cry2 are the negative regulators of the Period and Cryptochrome cycles.

Yagita et al. (2001) used wildtype and Cry1 -/- and Cry2 -/- deficient
cell lines derived from Cry mutant mice to demonstrate that the
peripheral oscillator in cultured fibroblasts is identical to the
oscillator in the suprachiasmatic nucleus in (1) temporal expression
profiles of all known clock genes; (2) the phase of the various mRNA
rhythms (i.e., antiphase oscillation of Bmal1 (602550) and Per); (3) the
delay between maximum mRNA levels and appearance of nuclear Per1 and
Per2 protein; (4) the inability to produce oscillations in the absence
of functional Cry genes; and (5) the control of period length by Cry
proteins.

Van Gelder et al. (2003) tested pupillary light responses of
cryptochrome mutant mice (Cry1 -/-; Cry2 -/-), outer retinal degenerate
(rd/rd) mice, and mice mutant at all of these loci, as well littermate
controls. There was substantial loss of constriction in the rd/rd mice
compared with control mice. The double mutants for the cryptochromes
showed a pupillary response similar in magnitude to that in control
mice. Almost no pupillary constriction was observed in the triple
knockouts at a 470-nm light intensity. Pupillary responses of the triple
mutants were about 5% as sensitive to blue light as those of the rd/rd
mice. Some pupillary responses were retained in the triple mutant mice
under very bright light, although pupillary movement was somewhat
sluggish. The 50% constriction threshold of pupillary responses was
noted in Cry1 -/-;rd/rd and Cry2 -/-;rd/rd mice, and was comparable to
those of rd/rd mice, indicating that either Cry1 or Cry2 function is
sufficient for retention of pupillary responses in rd/rd animals. Since
all mice were of the same strain background, strain differences were
unlikely to account for the observed differences in pupillary light
responses. Van Gelder et al. (2003) suggested that murine cryptochromes
may function as inner retinal photopigments.

608110	TITLE *608110 p21 PROTEIN-ACTIVATED KINASE 6; PAK6
;;p21 CDC42/RAC1-ACTIVATED KINASE 6
DESCRIPTION For background information on p21-activated kinases (PAKs), see PAK1
(602590).

CLONING

Using androgen receptor (AR; 313700) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen,
followed by 5-prime RACE, Yang et al. (2001) cloned PAK6 from a prostate
cDNA library. The deduced 681-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of about 75 kD. In vitro translation confirmed that PAK6
is a 75-kD protein. Like other members of the PAK family, PAK6 has an
N-terminal CDC42 (116952)/RAC (602048) interactive binding (CRIB) domain
and a C-terminal kinase domain. The C-terminal kinase domain of PAK6
shares 78% similarity with the corresponding regions of PAK4 (605451)
and PAK7 (608038). Northern blot analysis detected a 4.5-kb PAK6
transcript expressed at a high level in testis and at a lower level in
prostate. No expression was detected in the other tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

In a yeast 2-hybrid assay, Yang et al. (2001) found a 170-fold increase
in the association between PAK6 and AR in the presence of
dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Coimmunoprecipitation experiments confirmed
that the interaction between PAK6 and AR required DHT. The isolated
kinase domain of PAK6 was active against a test substrate, while
full-length PAK6 showed lower kinase activity.

MAPPING

Gross (2011) mapped the PAK6 gene to chromosome 15q15.1 based on an
alignment of the PAK6 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC035596) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

610602	TITLE *610602 AlkB, E. COLI, HOMOLOG OF, 2; ALKBH2
;;ABH2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The Escherichia coli AlkB protein protects against the cytotoxicity of
methylating agents by repair of the specific DNA lesions generated in
single-stranded DNA. ALKBH2 and ALKBH3 (610603) are E. coli AlkB
homologs that catalyze the removal of 1-methyladenine and
3-methylcytosine (Duncan et al., 2002).

CLONING

By searching human genomic and cDNA databases with ALKBH1 (605345) as
query, Duncan et al. (2002) obtained a full-length cDNA of ALKBH2. The
deduced protein shares 30.8% amino acid identity over the core region
with E. coli AlkB and shares similarity to
alpha-ketoglutarate/Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenases in the C-terminal
region. Northern blot analysis detected ALKBH2 expression in all tissues
examined, as well as several carcinoma cell lines, with highest
expression in liver and bladder. Immunofluorescence studies localized
ALKBH2 to the nucleus with a diffuse pattern throughout the nucleoplasm
and accumulation in the nucleoli.

By PCR of a testis cDNA library, Tsujikawa et al. (2007) cloned
full-length ABH2 and an ABH2 splice variant. The deduced full-length
261-amino acid protein has a C-terminal AlkB homology domain that is
predicted to function as a 2-oxoglutarate- and Fe(II)-dependent
oxygenase domain. The ABH2 splice variant lacks exon 3 and encodes a
157-amino acid isoform lacking the AlkB homology domain due to a
frameshift. Quantitative real-time PCR detected variable ABH2 expression
in all 16 tissues examined, with highest expression in testis.
Fluorescence-tagged full-length ABH2 was expressed in nuclei of
transfected HeLa cells, with particularly bright nucleolar staining. The
ABH2 splice variant was more diffusely expressed in nuclei and
cytoplasm.

GENE FUNCTION

Using purified GST- and histidine-tagged ALKBH2 overexpressed in E.
coli, Duncan et al. (2002) showed that ALKBH2 catalyzed the removal of
both 1-methyladenine and 3-methylcytosine from methylated
polynucleotides with 4-fold greater activity on 1-methyladenine than on
3-methylcytosine. ALKBH2 partially reverted 3-methylcytosine to cytosine
and repaired ethylated DNA bases through a mechanism similar to E. coli
AlkB activity.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Yang et al. (2008) demonstrated the first crystal structures of
AlkB-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and ABH2-dsDNA complexes, stabilized by
a chemical crosslinking strategy. This study revealed that AlkB uses an
unprecedented base-flipping mechanism to access the damaged base: it
squeezes together the 2 bases flanking the flipped-out one to maintain
the base stack, explaining the preference of AlkB for repairing
single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) lesions over dsDNA ones. In addition, the
first crystal structure of ABH2 provided a structural basis for
designing inhibitors of this human DNA repair protein.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tsujikawa et al. (2007) determined that the ALKBH2 gene contains at
least 4 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Duncan et al. (2002) mapped the ALKBH2
gene to chromosome 12q23.3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Ringvoll et al. (2006) generated mice with targeted disruption of Abh2,
Abh3 (ALKBH3; 610603), and Abh2/Abh3 double-knockout mice. Both single-
and double-knockout mice were viable and appeared normal into adulthood.
Using genomic DNA isolated from liver samples, the authors showed that
Abh2-null mice displayed an increased accumulation of 1-methyladenine
compared to wildtype and Abh3-null mice. Embryonic fibroblasts derived
from Abh2-null mice exhibited a decreased ability to remove methyl
methane sulfate (MMS)-induced 1-methyladenine from genomic DNA compared
to fibroblasts derived from both wildtype and Abh3-null mice. Ringvoll
et al. (2006) concluded that Abh2 is the primary oxidative demethylase
for repair of 1-methyladenine and 3-methylcytosine in double-stranded
DNA, and that Abh2 and Abh3 have different roles in repair of DNA damage
caused by alkylating agents.

612992	TITLE *612992 NEUROBLASTOMA BREAKPOINT FAMILY, MEMBER 3; NBPF3
DESCRIPTION For background information on the NBPF gene family, see NBPF1 (610501).

CLONING

By searching EST databases for NBPF family members, Vandepoele et al.
(2005) identified NBPF3. EST database analysis suggested ubiquitous
NBPF3 expression.

GENE STRUCTURE

Vandepoele et al. (2005) determined that the NBPF3 gene contains 13
coding exons.

Vandepoele and van Roy (2007) found that, unlike other transcriptionally
active NBPF family members, NBPF3 lacks an insertion of a human
endogenous retrovirus K long-terminal repeat in its 5-prime UTR.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis and FISH, Vandepoele et al. (2005) mapped
the NBPF3 gene to chromosome 1p36, where it lies in a cluster with NBPF1
and a pseudogene, NBPF2P.

;;OVIDUCTAL GLYCOPROTEIN, 120-KD
DESCRIPTION A 120-kD oviductal glycoprotein is secreted into the oviductal lumen
during the estrogen-dominated follicular and periovulatory phases of the
menstrual cycle. Arias et al. (1994) cloned the cDNA encoding the
oviductal glycoprotein. The sequence predicts a 654-amino acid
polypeptide that contains 4 potential N-glycosylation sites, 2 potential
N-myristoylation sites, and several potential phosphorylation sites. The
sequence has approximately 50% similarity to those of a subfamily of
glycosyl hydrolases. Northern blot analysis revealed a 2.4-kb message in
oviduct, but none in endometrium, cervix, or a variety of other tissues.
Slot blot analysis revealed that the expression of OVGP1 is highest
during the late follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, suggesting that
estrogen may control its expression.

;;GLUTAMATE-CYSTEINE LIGASE, REGULATORY; GLCLR;;
GAMMA-GLUTAMYLCYSTEINE SYNTHETASE, REGULATORY SUBUNIT
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase, also known as glutamate-cysteine
ligase (EC 6.3.2.2), is the first rate-limiting enzyme in glutathione
biosynthesis.

CLONING

Human liver gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase consists of 2 subunits: a
heavy catalytic subunit (GCLC; 606857) and a light regulatory subunit.
Gipp et al. (1995) reported the cloning of a full-length cDNA for the
light subunit. The cDNA encodes a 274-amino acid protein of
approximately 30.7 kD that is 96% identical to the previously cloned rat
sequence (Huang et al., 1993). Northern blot analysis detected 1.4- and
4.1-kb transcripts in several tissue types. The smaller transcript was
detected in the colon, whereas both forms were found in skeletal muscle.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rozet et al. (1998) determined that the GLCLR gene encompasses 22 kb and
contains 7 exons.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), Tsuchiya et al. (1995)
mapped the human GLCLR gene to 1p22-p21 and the mouse gene to 3H1-3. By
Southern blot analysis of DNA from a panel of somatic cell hybrids,
Sierra-Rivera et al. (1996) assigned GLCLR to chromosome 1;
sublocalization to 1p21 was achieved by FISH.

Rozet et al. (1998) found an EST of GLCLR within a YAC contig
encompassing the critically deleted region of human malignant
mesothelioma, between loci D1S435 and D1S236. They refined the physical
mapping of GLCLR to 1p22.1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Nakamura et al. (2002) reported an association between a polymorphism in
the GCLM gene (601176.0001) and myocardial infarction (608446).

Schizophrenia (181500) is a major and frequent chronic psychiatric
disorder with a strong genetic component. Converging evidence points to
the involvement of oxidative stress and N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA)
receptor (138249) hypofunction in the pathophysiology of the disease. As
a main cellular nonprotein antioxidant and redox regulator, glutathione
(GSH) plays a major role in protecting nervous tissue against reactive
oxygen species and in modulating redox-sensitive sites, including NMDA
receptors (NMDA-R). Tosic et al. (2006) noted that studies had found GSH
levels to be decreased in patients' cerebrospinal fluid, in medial
prefrontal cortex in vivo, and in striatum postmortem tissue.
GSH-deficient models revealed morphologic, electrophysiologic, and
behavioral anomalies similar to those observed in patients. Tosic et al.
(2006) found an association between schizophrenia and the gene of the
key GSH-synthesizing enzyme, GCLM. A functional role of the GCLM gene
variance in schizophrenia was supported by its low expression in
patients' fibroblasts and by the decreased stimulation of the enzyme
activity when challenged by an oxidative stress. The findings were
considered consistent with the concept that an abnormal GSH metabolism
is a factor for schizophrenia. One of the case-control studies was
conducted in Switzerland and the other in Denmark. Two particular
combinations of variation at 3 SNPs related to the GCLM gene, TT/GG/TC
and CC/GG/TT, had odds ratios of 4.89 and 4.17, respectively. Tosic et
al. (2006) observed that the GCLM gene is localized on 1p21, a region
shown by previous linkage studies to be one of the several critical for
schizophrenia (Pulver et al., 2000, Arinami et al., 2005).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
GCLM, -588C-T

In Japanese patients with myocardial infarction (608446), Nakamura et
al. (2002) searched for common variants in the 5-prime flanking region
of the GCLM gene and identified a -588C-T polymorphism in which the T
allele showed lower promoter activity (40 to 50% of that of the C
allele) in response to oxidants. Analyzing 429 patients with MI and 428
controls, the authors found that the frequency of the T polymorphism was
significantly higher in the MI group than in the control group (p less
than 0.001). In multiple logistic regression analysis, the T
polymorphism was a risk factor for MI independent of traditional
coronary artery disease risk factors (OR = 1.98, 95% CI = 1.38-2.83, p
less than 0.001). Nakamura et al. (2002) suggested that the -588T
polymorphism may suppress oxidant induction of the GCLM gene and that it
is a risk factor for MI.

Nakamura et al. (2003) examined the effects of the -588C-T polymorphism
on coronary arterial diameter and blood flow responses to intracoronary
infusion of acetylcholine in 157 consecutive patients with normal
coronary angiograms. In multivariate linear regression analysis with
covariates including traditional risk factors, the minor -588T allele
had an independent association with impaired dilation of epicardial
coronary arteries in response to acetylcholine (p less than 0.001), and
it was independently associated with a blunted increase in coronary flow
response to acetylcholine (p less than 0.01). In a subgroup of 59
consecutive patients, constrictor responses to intracoronary infusion of
NG-monomethyl-L-arginine monoacetate, had an inverse and independent
association with the -558T allele in multivariate analysis (p less than
0.01). Nakamura et al. (2003) concluded that the -588T polymorphism
causes a decrease in endothelial nitric oxide bioactivity, leading to
impairment of endothelium-dependent vasomotor function in large and
resistance coronary arteries.

611017	TITLE *611017 TRYPSIN DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; TYSND1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

All peroxisomal proteins are synthesized in the cytosol, and 2 distinct
peroxisomal targeting signals (PTSs), the C-terminal PTS1 and N-terminal
PTS2, are used for transport of these proteins into peroxisomes.
Proteolytic cleavage of the N-terminal targeting sequence of PTS2
proteins accompanies import into peroxisomes, and many PTS1 proteins
undergo C-terminal processing once in the peroxisomal matrix. TYSND1
processes both PTS1 and PTS2 proteins involved in beta-oxidation of
fatty acids (Kurochkin et al., 2007).

CLONING

By database analysis, Kurochkin et al. (2005) identified mouse Tysnd1
and its rat and human homologs. The mouse Tysnd1 protein has a PTS1
motif and 2 protease-related domains.

Kurochkin et al. (2007) stated that mouse Tysnd1 contains 568 amino
acids and has 2 trypsin-like serine and cysteine peptidase domains.
Western blot analysis of transfected COS-7 cells revealed a 59-kD
protein corresponding to full-length recombinant Tysnd1 and a 49-kD
protein representing the processed form. Fractionation of rat liver
homogenate and Western blot analysis showed that endogenous Tysnd1 was
synthesized as a 59-kD protein and converted to 49- and 27-kD forms
following import into peroxisomes. Confocal microscopy localized Tysnd1
to peroxisomes of transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Kurochkin et al. (2007) showed that mouse Tysnd1 processed the
PTS2-containing peroxisomal precursor 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase
(prethiolase, or ACAA1; 604054) and several PTS1-containing peroxisomal
enzymes, including peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX1; 609751), to
their mature forms in transfected COS-7 cells. Small interfering
RNA-mediated downregulation of TYSND1 in human embryonic kidney cells
blocked processing of these peroxisomal enzymes. Additional studies
showed that Tysnd1 directly processed peroxisomal enzymes in vitro,
including prethiolase, which it cleaved between cys26 and ser27 to
produce the mature form observed in vivo. Tysnd1 processing activity was
abolished by N-ethylmaleimide, an inhibitor of cysteine proteinases.
Kurochkin et al. (2007) determined that Tysnd1 itself is cleaved between
cys110 and ala111, presumably removing an inhibitory N-terminal
fragment.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the TYSND1
gene to chromosome 10 (TMAP D10S1466).

607349	TITLE *607349 TALIN 2; TLN2
;;KIAA0320
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By randomly sequencing clones from a brain cDNA library, Nagase et al.
(1997) obtained a partial cDNA encoding TLN2, which they called
KIAA0320. RT-PCR detected expression in heart, brain, kidney, thymus,
testis, and small intestine.

Using genomic and cDNA/EST sequences, Monkley et al. (2001) assembled
the complete coding sequence for TLN2. The deduced 2,532-amino acid
protein contains a FERM domain. In TLN1 (186745), the FERM domain binds
the cytodomains of beta-1 (135630) and beta-3 (173470) integrins, as
well as to F-actin (see 102610) and other proteins. TLN2 shares 74%
identity with TLN1, and the N- and C-terminal regions of TLN2 are highly
conserved across species. Analysis of EST databases indicated that both
TLN1 and TLN2 are expressed in brain, lung, heart, eye, mammary gland,
colon, stomach, lymphocytes, germ cells, liver, spleen, bone, and many
tumors. Northern blot analysis of adult mouse tissues revealed multiple
Tln2 transcripts, with highest expression in heart and undetectable
expression in spleen.

GENE FUNCTION

DiPaolo et al. (2002) and Ling et al. (2002) presented evidence that
talin, through its FERM domain, interacts with the C-terminal tail of
the 90-kD PIP5K1C (606102) isoform. DiPaolo et al. (2002) determined
that, in rat brain, the predominant talin that interacts with PIP5K1C is
Tln2. The authors showed that this interaction induces clustering of
PIP5D1C and talin at focal adhesions and increases the local production
of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate.

GENE STRUCTURE

Monkley et al. (2001) determined that the TLN2 gene contains 55 exons
and spans about 190 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1997) mapped the TLN2 gene
to chromosome 15. By genomic sequence analysis, Monkley et al. (2001)
mapped the TLN2 gene to chromosome 15q15-q21.

603601	TITLE *603601 PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL 3-KINASE, CLASS 2, ALPHA; PIK3C2A
;;C2-CONTAINING PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL KINASE; CPK
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks) phosphorylate the 3-prime OH
position of the inositol ring of inositol lipids. See 602838.

CLONING

Molz et al. (1996) cloned Drosophila and mouse homologs of a novel PI3K
that they termed Cpk. Cpk contains a C-terminal calcium-binding and
phospholipid-binding module known as the C2 domain. Domin et al. (1997)
cloned human PI3KC2-alpha, the human ortholog of Cpk. The cDNA sequence
predicts a 1,686-amino acid protein that is 90% identical to mouse Cpk.
Northern blot analysis revealed that PIK3C2A is expressed as an 8-kb
mRNA in a wide variety of tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Domin et al. (1997) determined that the PIK3C2A enzyme can phosphorylate
phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate in vitro.

Posor et al. (2013) showed that formation of
phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P2) by PI3KC2A
spatiotemporally controls clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Depletion of
PI(3,4)P2 or PI3KC2A impairs the maturation of late-stage
clathrin-coated pits before fission. Timed formation of PI(3,4)P2 by
PI3KC2A is required for selective enrichment of the BAR domain protein
SNX9 (605952) at late-stage endocytic intermediates. Posor et al. (2013)
concluded that their findings provided a mechanistic framework for the
role of PI(3,4)P2 in endocytosis and unraveled a novel discrete function
of PI(3,4)P2 in the central cell physiologic process of
clatherin-mediated endocytosis.

GENE STRUCTURE

By sequence analysis, Caldwell et al. (2001) determined that the PIK3C2A
gene contains 32 exons and spans approximately 76 kb.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Caldwell et al. (2001) identified the PIK3C2A
sequence on chromosome 11p15.1-p14.

300885	TITLE *300885 CYTOCHROME c OXIDASE, SUBUNIT VIIb; COX7B
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cytochrome c oxidase (COX), the terminal component of the respiratory
chain complex of most aerobic organisms, is composed of 13 subunits in
mammals. Three COX subunits are encoded by mitochondrial DNA, and 10,
including COX7B, are encoded by nuclear DNA (summary by Sadlock et al.,
1993).

CLONING

By screening a human endothelial cell library with a partial bovine COX
VIIb cDNA, Sadlock et al. (1993) isolated a cDNA encoding human COX
VIIb. The predicted 80-amino acid human protein contains a 24-amino acid
leader sequence. The mature human and bovine COX VIIb polypeptides are
82% identical. Southern blot analysis indicated that the COX VIIb gene
is part of a large gene family in the human genome. In a review article,
Lenka et al. (1998) noted that the COX VIIb subunit is found in all
mammalian tissues.

MAPPING

Gross (2012) mapped the COX7B gene to chromosome Xq21.1 based on an
alignment of the COX7B sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK311879) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 4 female patients with reticulolinear aplasia cutis congenita
associated with microcephaly, facial dysmorphism, and other congenital
anomalies (APLCC; 300887), Indrieri et al. (2012) identified
heterozygosity for a 1-bp deletion, a splice site mutation, and a
nonsense mutation, respectively (300885.0001-300885.0003).

ANIMAL MODEL

Indrieri et al. (2012) performed morpholino knockdown of cox7b in medaka
fish (Oryzias latipes) and observed a dose-dependent phenotype
characterized by microcephaly and microphthalmia, as well as severe
cardiac defects including failure of heart loop formation and
pericardial edema.

COX7B, 1-BP DEL, 196C

In a female patient with reticulolinear congenital skin defects,
microcephaly, facial dysmorphism, and short stature (APLCC; 300887), who
was originally described by Zvulunov et al. (1998), Indrieri et al.
(2012) identified heterozygosity for a de novo 1-bp deletion (196delC)
in exon 3 of the COX7B gene, causing a frameshift predicted to result in
premature termination (Leu66CysfsTer48) and a mutant protein lacking the
domain that interacts with COX subunits COX4 (123864) and COX6C
(124090). The mutation was not found in her parents, in 200 ethnically
matched controls, or in the dbSNP or NHLBI Exome Variant Server
databases.

facial dysmorphism, short stature, atrial septal defect and ventricular
hypertrophy, right diaphragmatic hernia, and agenesis of the left kidney
with ureteral duplication of the right kidney (APLCC; 300887), Indrieri
et al. (2012) identified heterozygosity for a de novo A-G transition
(41-2A-G) in intron 1 of the COX7B gene, predicted to create a novel
splice acceptor site 1 base before the wildtype splice site
(Val14Glyfs*19). The mutation was not found in her parents or in the
dbSNP or NHLBI Exome Variant Server databases. In vitro analysis
demonstrated that 90% of mutant transcripts contained an additional
guanine at the start of exon 2, causing out-of-frame transcripts
predicted to result in premature termination.

intellectual disability (APLCC; 300887), Indrieri et al. (2012)
identified heterozygosity for a 55C-T transition in exon 2 of the COX7B
gene, resulting in a gln19-to-ter (Q19X) substitution. The nonsense
mutation was also present in heterozygosity in the proband's mother, who
was born with reticulolinear congenital skin defects of the face and
neck but had no other manifestations and normal cognitive function. The
proband's 3 healthy sisters and healthy brother all inherited the
wildtype allele from their mother, and the mutation was not found in the
dbSNP or NHLBI Exome Variant Server databases.

608853	TITLE *608853 BH3-LIKE MOTIF-CONTAINING CELL DEATH INDUCER; BLID
;;BREAST CANCER CELL 2; BRCC2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Broustas et al. (2004) amplified a BRCC2 cDNA from breast cancer cell
line mRNA. The deduced 108-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of about 12 kD. The N terminus contains a domain similar to the BH3
domain of proapoptotic proteins. Western blot analysis detected
endogenous BRCC2 in all human cell lines tested. In COS-1 and HeLa
cells, BRCC2 was predominantly a cytosolic protein, with lower abundance
in mitochondria.

GENE FUNCTION

Broustas et al. (2004) found that exogenous expression of BRCC2 caused
apoptotic cell death, as evidenced by enhanced chromatin condensation,
DNA fragmentation, or an enhanced number of cells in the sub-G1 phase.
In a human prostate cancer cell line, BRCC2-induced DNA fragmentation
was blocked by coexpression of the antiapoptotic molecule BCLXL (600039)
or by a broad-range caspase inhibitor. BRCC2 expression correlated with
activation of CASP3 (600636) and CASP9 (602234). BRCC2 with an
N-terminal deletion of the BH3-like domain failed to induce apoptosis.
Treatment of HeLa cells with doxorubicin or hydrogen peroxide led to an
increase in the mitochondrial level of endogenous BRCC2. Broustas et al.
(2004) concluded that BRCC2 functions as a proapoptotic molecule through
the caspase-dependent mitochondrial pathway of cell death.

GENE STRUCTURE

Broustas et al. (2004) determined that BRCC2 is an intronless gene.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Broustas et al. (2004) mapped the BLID
gene to chromosome 11q24.1.

Rogaeva et al. (2007) indicated that the BRCC2 gene is located just
distal to SORL1 (602005).

610716	TITLE *610716 TIMELESS-INTERACTING PROTEIN; TIPIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using mouse Timeless (TIM; 603887) in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a mouse
embryo cDNA library, Gotter (2003) cloned Tipin. By EST database
analysis and RT-PCR of brain mRNA, he cloned full-length human TIPIN.
The deduced 301-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of
34.5 kD. It shares 72% amino acid identity with mouse Tipin, with the
greatest divergence in the C termini. Northern blot analysis of mouse
embryos detected highest Tipin levels between embryonic days 11 and 15.
In situ hybridization showed coexpression of Tim and Tipin in early
embryonic and extraembryonic tissues, although Tipin was more widely
expressed. After embryonic day 14.5, both Tim and Tipin were abundantly
expressed in thymus, liver, gastrointestinal tract, and ventricular zone
of brain, and Tipin was also expressed in lung. In adult mouse brain,
Tipin was expressed in thalamic and cortical regions, with lower
expression in suprachiasmatic nuclei.

By Western blot analysis of HeLa cells, Chou and Elledge (2006) found
that TIPIN had an apparent molecular mass of 48 kD. Immunofluorescence
localization detected TIPIN in HeLa cell nuclei. TIPIN colocalized with
chromatin and was excluded from the nucleolus.

GENE FUNCTION

By coimmunoprecipitation analysis, Gotter (2003) showed that mouse Tipin
interacted with Tim in vitro and in cultured cells. In transiently
transfected cells, Tim promoted nuclear localization of Tipin.
Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that Tipin disrupted the ability
of Tim to form homomultimeric complexes, suggesting a mechanism through
which Tipin may modulate Tim function.

Chou and Elledge (2006) found that TIPIN associated with the components
of the replicative helicase (e.g., MCM7; 600592) in human cell lines and
protected cells against genotoxic agents. TIPIN was required for
efficient cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage, and depletion of
TIPIN rendered cells sensitive to ionizing radiation as well as
replication stress. Loss of TIPIN resulted in spontaneous gamma-H2AX
(601772) foci, a marker for DNA double-strand breaks. TIPIN and TIM
formed a complex that maintained the level of both proteins in cells,
and loss of either one led to loss of the other.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gotter (2003) determined that the TIPIN gene contains 8 exons and spans
20 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Gotter (2003) mapped the TIPIN gene to
chromosome 15q22.31. He mapped the mouse Tipin gene to a region of
chromosome 9 that shares homology of synteny with human chromosome
15q22.31.

612476	TITLE *612476 BASIC LEUCINE ZIPPER TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR, ATF-LIKE; BATF
;;B-CELL ACTIVATING TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR;;
BATF1;;
SFA2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

BATF is a transcription factor expressed in hematopoietic cells (Meyer
et al., 1998).

CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of a B-cell cDNA library using the N
terminus of v-myc (190080) as bait, Dorsey et al. (1995) isolated BATF.
The 125-amino acid protein has a serine-rich N terminus and a central
basic leucine zipper (bZIP) region. Northern blot analysis revealed a
1.0-kb transcript in human lung, placenta, liver, kidney, spleen, and
peripheral blood, but not in several other tissues examined. BATF
expression was detected in colorectal carcinoma and hematopoietic tumor
cell lines, but not in lung carcinoma, HeLa, or melanoma cell lines.
Immunohistochemical and fluorescence microscopy demonstrated expression
of a nuclear BATF protein in transfected COS-1 cells.

By differential screening of an adult T-cell leukemia cell line cDNA
library to identify human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV)-1-induced genes,
Hasegawa et al. (1996) cloned BATF, which they termed SFA2. In addition
to leucine-rich and bZIP regions, BATF contains a potential N-terminal
casein kinase II (see 115440) phosphorylation site. Northern blot
analysis detected strong expression of BATF in both mature B and T
lymphocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis and in vitro binding assays, Dorsey et al.
(1995) showed that BATF formed heterodimers with JUN (165160), JUNB
(165161), and JUND (165162). BATF did not form homodimers. EMSA analysis
showed that BATF-JUN heterodimers bound to activator protein-1 (AP1; see
165160) sites in vitro. Dorsey et al. (1995) proposed that BATF is a
tissue-specific regulator of the AP1 transcription complex.

By analyzing gene expression in sorted CD8 (see 186910)-positive T cells
specific for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 (see 609423) Gag
protein from HIV-positive individuals, Quigley et al. (2010) showed that
the PD1 (PDCD1; 600244) inhibitory receptor coordinately upregulated a
program of genes in 'exhausted' CD8-positive T cells. The program
included upregulation of BATF. Enforced expression of BATF was
sufficient to impair T-cell proliferation and cytokine secretion,
whereas BATF knockdown reduced PD1 inhibition. BATF silencing in T cells
from individuals with chronic viremia rescued HIV-specific T-cell
function. Quigley et al. (2010) concluded that inhibitory receptors can
cause T-cell exhaustion by upregulating genes, such as BATF, that
inhibit T-cell function and may be targets to improve T-cell immunity to
HIV.

BATF3 (612470) is required for homeostatic development of
CD8-alpha-positive classical dendritic cells that prime CD8 T-cell
responses against intracellular pathogens. Tussiwand et al. (2012)
identified an alternative, Batf3-independent pathway in mice for
CD8-alpha-positive dendritic cell development operating during infection
with intracellular pathogens and mediated by the cytokines interleukin
(IL)-12 (161560) and interferon-gamma (147570). This alternative pathway
results from molecular compensation for Batf3 provided by the related
AP1 factors Batf, which also functions in T and B cells, and Batf2
(614983) induced by cytokines in response to infection. Reciprocally,
physiologic compensation between Batf and Batf3 also occurs in T cells
for expression of IL10 (124092) and CTLA4 (123890). Compensation among
BATF factors is based on the shared capacity of their leucine zipper
domains to interact with non-AP1 factors such as IRF4 (601900) and IRF8
(601565) to mediate cooperative gene activation.

Li et al. (2012) showed that in mouse CD4+ T cells and B cells IRF4
unexpectedly can cooperate with AP1 complexes to bind to AP1-IRF4
composite (5-prime-TGAnTCA/GAAA-3-prime) motifs that they denoted as
AP1-IRF composite elements (AICEs). Moreover, BATF-JUN family protein
complexes cooperate with IRF4 in binding to AICEs in preactivated CD4+ T
cells stimulated with IL21 (605384) and in TH17 differentiated cells.
Importantly, BATF binding was diminished in Irf4-null T cells, and IRF4
binding was diminished in Batf-null T cells, consistent with functional
cooperation between these factors. Moreover, Li et al. (2012) showed
that AP1 and IRF complexes cooperatively promote transcription of the
Il10 gene, which is expressed in TH17 cells and potently regulated by
IL21. Li et al. (2012) concluded that their findings revealed that IRF4
can signal via complexes containing ETS or AP1 motifs depending on the
cellular context.

Using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and T-helper-17 (TH17)
cells, Glasmacher et al. (2012) found that IRF4 targets sequences
enriched for activated protein-1 (AP1; 165160)-IRF composite elements
(AICEs) that are cobound by BATF, an AP1 factor required for TH17, B,
and dendritic cell differentiation. IRF4 and BATF bind cooperatively to
structurally divergent AICEs to promote gene activation and TH17
differentiation. The AICE motif directs assembly of IRF4 or IRF8 with
BATF heterodimers and is also used in TH2, B, and dendritic cells.
Glasmacher et al. (2012) concluded that this genomic regulatory element
and cognate factors appear to have evolved to integrate diverse
immunomodulatory signals.

GENE STRUCTURE

Meyer et al. (1998) determined that the BATF gene contains 3 exons and
spans approximately 17 kb.

MAPPING

Using FISH, Meyer et al. (1998) mapped the BATF gene to chromosome
14q24.

ANIMAL MODEL

After a gene expression survey identified Batf as highly expressed in
Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells compared with naive T and B cells, Schraml et
al. (2009) generated mice lacking Batf. Batf -/- mice were fertile and
appeared healthy, with normal immune system organs and development of T
and B lymphocytes and dendritic cells. Although Batf -/- mice animals
showed normal Th1 and Th2 differentiation, Th17 conditions resulted in
reduced Il17 (see IL17A; 603149) production. Batf -/- T cells failed to
induce factors required for Th17 differentiation, such as Rorgt (RORC;
602943) and Il21 (605384), but addition of these factors did not fully
restore Il17 production. Batf -/- mice had a T-cell-intrinsic defect
preventing development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis that
was T-regulatory cell independent. Microarray and quantitative RT-PCR
analyses showed that the Th17 regulatory genes Rorc, Rora (600825), Ahr
(600253), Il22 (605330), and Il17 were Batf dependent. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation and EMSA analyses revealed that Batf bound to the
proximal Il17a, Il17f (606496), Il21, and Il22 promoters, and that Batf
preferentially formed heterodimers with Junb during Th17
differentiation. Schraml et al. (2009) concluded that BATF is
selectively required for Th17, but not Th2, differentiation.

602113	TITLE *602113 MYELOID/LYMPHOID OR MIXED LINEAGE LEUKEMIA 2; MLL2
;;ALL1-RELATED GENE; ALR
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The SET domain is a motif characteristic of proteins such as human ALL1
(159555) and Drosophila 'trithorax' (trx) and is found at the C terminus
of the 2 proteins. Using the ALL1 SET domain as a probe, Prasad et al.
(1997) cloned a novel gene, which they designated ALR (ALL1-related
gene). The gene encodes a 5,262-amino acid protein containing a SET
domain, 5 PHD fingers, potential zinc fingers, and a long run of
glutamines interrupted by hydrophobic residues (mostly leucine). They
also detected an alternatively spliced form encoding 4,957 amino acids
and lacking an N-terminal zinc finger and PHD finger. Analysis of ALR
expression showed that its approximately 18-kb transcript is expressed,
like ALL1, in most adult tissues, including a variety of hematopoietic
cells, but not in liver. Whole mount in situ hybridization of early
mouse embryos indicated expression of a similar mouse gene in multiple
tissues. Based on similarities in structure and expression pattern,
Prasad et al. (1997) concluded that ALR is likely to play a role similar
to those of ALL1 and trx.

OTHER FEATURES

By database searching, Karlin et al. (2002) identified 192 human protein
sequences that have multiple amino acid runs, many of which are
associated with disease, including cancer. Karlin et al. (2002) found
that a key aspect of 82 of these protein sequences is their role in
transcription, translation, and developmental regulation. MLL2 is a
striking example with 24 amino acid runs, all but 2 of which are
glutamine runs. Karlin et al. (2002) concluded that genes encoding a
significant number of long amino acid runs are potentially associated
with disease.

MAPPING

By analysis of rodent/human hybrid cells and analysis of the Genebridge
radiation hybrid panel, Prasad et al. (1997) mapped the ALR gene to the
12p13.1-qter region and within a 13-cR chromosome region corresponding
to a physical size of approximately 340 kb near D12S1401. Based on
information from 3 databases, they placed ALR between vitamin D receptor
(601769) at 12q12-q14 and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (138420),
which is located in the same region. Prasad et al. (1997) noted that the
12q12-q13 region is involved in duplications and translocations
associated with cancer.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Kabuki Syndrome 1

Ng et al. (2010) performed the exome sequencing of 10 unrelated patients
with Kabuki syndrome (KABUK1; 147920), 7 of European ancestry, 2 of
Hispanic ancestry and 1 of mixed European and Haitian ancestry, and
identified nonsense or frameshift mutations in the MLL2 gene in 7
patients. Follow-up Sanger sequencing detected MLL2 mutations in 2 of
the 3 remaining individuals with Kabuki syndrome and in 26 of 43
additional cases. In all, they identified 33 distinct MLL2 mutations in
35 of 53 families (66%) with Kabuki syndrome (see, e.g.,
602113.0001-602113.0004). In each of 12 cases for which DNA from both
parents was available, the MLL2 variant was found to have occurred de
novo. MLL2 mutations were also identified in each of 2 families in which
Kabuki syndrome was transmitted from parent to child. None of the
additional MLL2 mutations was found in 190 control chromosomes from
individuals of matched geographic ancestry. Ng et al. (2010) suggested
that mutations in MLL2 are a major cause of Kabuki syndrome.

Hannibal et al. (2011) identified 70 mutations in the MLL2 gene in 81
(74%) of 110 kindreds with Kabuki syndrome. In simplex cases for which
DNA was available from both parents, 25 mutations were confirmed to be
de novo, whereas a transmitted mutation was found in 2 of 3 familial
cases. Most of the variants were nonsense or frameshift mutations
predicted to result in haploinsufficiency. Mutations occurred throughout
the gene, but were particularly common in exons 39 and 48. The clinical
features of those with or without mutations were similar, except for
renal anomalies, which occurred in 47% of mutation carriers compared to
14% of those who did not have a mutation.

Li et al. (2011) sequenced all 54 coding exons of the MLL2 gene in 34
patients with Kabuki syndrome and identified 18 distinct mutations in 19
patients, 11 of 12 tested de novo. Mutations were located throughout the
gene and included 3 nonsense mutations, 2 splice site mutations, 6 small
deletions or insertions, and 7 missense mutations. Li et al. (2011)
compared frequencies of clinical symptoms in MLL2 mutation carriers
versus noncarriers. MLL2 mutation carriers more often presented with
short stature and renal anomalies (p = 0.026 and 0.031, respectively),
and in addition, MLL2 showed a more typical facial gestalt (17 of 19)
compared with noncarriers (9 of 15), although this result was not
statistically significant (p = 0.1). Mutation-negative patients were
subsequently tested for mutations in 10 functional candidate genes, but
no convincing causative mutations could be identified. Li et al. (2011)
concluded that MLL2 is the major gene for Kabuki syndrome with a wide
spectrum of de novo mutations but that there is further genetic
heterogeneity accounting for MLL2 mutation-negative patients.

Banka et al. (2012) analyzed the MLL2 gene in a cohort of 116 patients
with Kabuki syndrome, including 18 patients previously reported by
Hannibal et al. (2011), and identified MLL2 variants in 74 (63.8%).
Banka et al. (2012) stated that 170 (73.2%) of 232 published MLL2
mutation-positive kabuki syndrome patients had truncating mutations.
They also noted that pathogenic missense mutations were commonly located
in exon 48.

- Somatic Mutations

Parsons et al. (2011) identified inactivating mutations in the MLL2 gene
in approximately 10% of sequenced medulloblastomas from children.

Morin et al. (2011) found that somatic mutations in MLL2 were present in
32% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas and 89% of follicular lymphoma
cases.

609130	TITLE *609130 APOPTOSIS-INDUCING, TAF9-LIKE DOMAIN 1; APITD1
;;CENTROMERIC PROTEIN S; CENPS;;
FANCM-INTERACTING HISTONE-FOLD PROTEIN 1; MHF1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The Fanconi anemia (FA) nuclear core complex (see 607139) is required
for DNA damage response and repair. STRA13 (615128) and APITD1 form a
heterodimeric DNA-remodeling complex that interacts with the FA complex
component FANCM (609644) to facilitate repair of branched DNA (Yan et
al., 2010; Singh et al., 2010).

CLONING

Using in silico mapping methods, Krona et al. (2004) identified 2
alternatively spliced transcripts of a novel gene, designated APITD1,
within a 500-kb neuroblastoma tumor suppressor candidate region on
chromosome 1p36.22. Transcript A encodes a deduced 138-amino acid
protein with a calculated molecular mass of 16 kD, and transcript B
encodes a deduced 99-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass
of 11 kD. Both proteins contain a TAF9 (313650)-like domain. Northern
blot analysis of neuroblastoma cell lines detected ubiquitous expression
of a major, approximately 1.5 kb and a minor, less than 1 kb transcript.
Expression of transcript A was generally higher in fetal tissues,
whereas that of transcript B was higher in adult tissues. Expression of
both was significantly reduced in several primary neuroblastoma tumors
and in tumors of varied tissue origin.

GENE STRUCTURE

Krona et al. (2004) determined that the APITD1 gene contains 6 exons,
including alternative exons 1A and 1B, and spans about 13 kb. Both exons
1A and 1B are preceded by a CpG island.

MAPPING

By analysis of human/rodent somatic cell hybrids, Krona et al. (2004)
mapped the APITD1 gene to chromosome 1. By genomic sequence analysis,
they refined the location of the gene to 1p36.22, in a head-to-tail
orientation between the PGD (172200) and CORT (602784) genes.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoprecipitation of CENPA (117139)-containing complexes from HeLa
cells, followed by multiple tandem affinity purifications, Foltz et al.
(2006) identified CENPS associated with CENPM (610152) and CENPU
(MLF1IP; 611511) but not directly associated with the CENPA
nucleosome-associated complex.

By coimmunoprecipitation analysis of chicken DT40 cells, Amano et al.
(2009) found that Cenps interacted with Cenpx (STRA13), but not with
other centromeric proteins, in a centromeric protein subcomplex. Cenps
-/- and Cenpx -/- DT40 cells showed slow mitotic progression and
increased numbers of apoptotic cells. Knockdown of CENPS and CENPX in
HeLa cells via small interfering RNA caused more severe mitotic defects,
including misaligned chromosomes. Knockdown of CENPX in DT40 and HeLa
cells eliminated kinetochore localization of CENPS. Knockout of Cenps
and Cenpx reduced localization of the outer kinetochore proteins Ndc80
(607272) and Knl1 (CASC5; 609173) and increased intrakinetochore
distance in the absence of tension. Amano et al. (2009) proposed that
the CENPS-CENPX subcomplex is essential for stable assembly of outer
kinetochore proteins.

Yan et al. (2010) and Singh et al. (2010) independently found that
APITD1 and STRA13, which they called MHF1 and MHF2, were associated with
a high-molecular-mass complex containing FA complex components and Bloom
syndrome complex components (e.g., RECQL3; 604610). MHF1 and MHF2 also
associated in a much smaller complex distinct from the FA core complex.
Coimmunoprecipitation and yeast 2-hybrid analyses confirmed direct
interaction between MHF1 and MHF2. MHF1 and MHF2 appeared to associate
predominantly with FANCM and FAAP24 (C19ORF40; 610884), but not with
other FA complex components. MHF1 mediated interaction of the MHF1-MHF2
heterodimer with FANCM. The MHF1-MHF2 heterodimer, but not either
component alone, also bound several types of branched DNA and enhanced
FANCM binding to branched DNA. HeLa cells depleted of either MHF protein
displayed reduced monoubiquitination and foci formation by FANCD2
(613984) in response to DNA damage. Depletion of the MHF proteins also
resulted in hypersensitivity of cells to DNA-damaging agents. Yan et al.
(2010) found that FANCM and the MHF proteins were recruited to DNA
interstrand crosslinks during S phase, apparently stimulated by DNA
replication. Using a DNA branch migration assay, Singh et al. (2010)
found that the MHF1-MHF2 dimer itself was devoid of activity, but that
it enhanced FANCM-dependent DNA branch migration. Yan et al. (2010) and
Singh et al. (2010) concluded that the MHF1-MHF2 heterodimer is required
for normal activation of the FA pathway in response to DNA damage.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Krona et al. (2004) performed genomic sequence analysis of the APITD1
gene in 44 neuroblastoma tumors and identified no loss-of-function
mutations, indicating that the gene is not a common abnormality of such
tumors.

608172	TITLE *608172 DEHYDRODOLICHYL DIPHOSPHATE SYNTHASE; DHDDS
;;DEDOL-PP SYNTHASE;;
HDS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Dehydrodolichyl diphosphate (dedol-PP) synthase catalyzes cis-prenyl
chain elongation to produce the polyprenyl backbone of dolichol, a
glycosyl carrier lipid required for the biosynthesis of several classes
of glycoproteins (summary by Endo et al., 2003).

CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to E. coli undecaprenyl
diphosphate synthase (UPS) and S. cerevisiae dedol-PP synthase, followed
by RT-PCR of a testis cDNA library, Endo et al. (2003) cloned DHDDS,
which they designated HDS. The deduced 333-amino acid DHDDS protein
contains all 5 regions conserved among cis-prenyl chain-elongating
enzymes in several eukaryotic and prokaryotic species. DHDDS shares
41.8% homology with yeast dedol-PP synthase and 37.6% homology with E.
coli UPS. Northern blot analysis detected high DHDDS expression in
testis and kidney, with lower levels in heart, spleen, and thymus.

Zelinger et al. (2011) performed RT-PCR analysis in 21 human tissues and
observed ubiquitous expression of DHDDS, with a band of higher intensity
in the retinal sample compare to other tissues. The analysis confirmed
the expression of the full-length transcript in the retina as well as 3
alternatively spliced variants, 2 of which were in-frame and likely to
encode a protein.

GENE STRUCTURE

Endo et al. (2003) determined that the DHDDS gene contains 8 coding
exons and spans more than 37 kb. Zelinger et al. (2011) noted that the
DHDDS gene contains 9 exons and that exon 1 is noncoding.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Endo et al. (2003) mapped the DHDDS gene
to chromosome 1p35.

By genomic sequence analysis, Zelinger et al. (2011) mapped the DHDDS
gene to chromosome 1p36.11.

GENE FUNCTION

By in vitro assay, Endo et al. (2003) demonstrated cis-prenyltransferase
activity in DHDDS-transformed yeast membrane fractions incubated with
radiolabeled isopentenyl diphosphate and farnesyl diphosphate as
substrates. Thin-layer chromatography detected synthesis of high levels
of dolichols with major chain lengths of C90, C95, and C100, consistent
with dolichols isolated from human tissues.

Zelinger et al. (2011) performed immunohistochemical analysis of the
human retina with anti-DHDDS antibodies and observed intense labeling of
the cone and rod photoreceptor inner segments.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 affected sibs from an Ashkenazi Jewish family with retinitis
pigmentosa (RP59; 613861), in whom mutation in all known RP genes had
been excluded, Zuchner et al. (2011) performed whole-exome sequencing
and identified homozygosity for a missense mutation in the DDHS gene
(K42E; 608172.0001) that was not present in their unaffected sib. The
unaffected parents were heterozygous for the mutation, which was
detected in heterozygosity in 8 of 717 Ashkenazi Jewish controls but was
not found in 6,977 confirmed non-Ashkenazi white controls; the variant
was also found once in 5,893 additional white controls for whom
genomewide genotype data were not available. Zuchner et al. (2011)
stated that E42K likely arose from an ancestral founder.

In 15 (12%) of 123 Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) probands with RP, Zelinger et
al. (2011) identified homozygosity for the K42E founder mutation. The
K42E mutation was found in heterozygosity in 1 of 322 ethnically matched
controls, indicating a carrier frequency of 0.3% in the AJ population,
but was not detected in an additional set of 109 AJ patients with RP, in
20 AJ patients with other inherited retinal diseases, or in 70 patients
with retinal degeneration of other ethnic origins.

ANIMAL MODEL

By morpholino-knockdown of Dhdds in zebrafish, Zuchner et al. (2011)
observed failure to exhibit the typical escape response to light on-off
switches, and microscopic examination of the morphant retina revealed
that photoreceptor outer segments were very short or completely missing;
in addition, one-third of zebrafish morphants had smaller eyes and a
slight ventral flexion to the body axis.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 59
DHDDS, LYS42GLU

In 3 affected sibs from an Ashkenazi Jewish family with retinitis
pigmentosa (RP59; 613861), Zuchner et al. (2011) identified homozygosity
for a 124A-G transition in exon 3 of the DHDDS gene, resulting in a
lys42-to-glu (K42E) substitution at a highly conserved residue located
close to the catalytic center and the substrate binding site for
farnesyl phosphate. The unaffected parents were heterozygous for the
mutation, which was also detected in heterozygosity in 8 of 717
Ashkenazi Jewish controls but not found in 6,977 confirmed non-Ashkenazi
white controls; the variant was also found once in 5,893 additional
white controls for whom genomewide genotype data were not available.

In 20 Ashkenazi Jewish patients with RP from 15 families, Zelinger et
al. (2011) identified homozygosity for the E42K founder mutation in exon
3 of the DHDDS gene.

603320	TITLE *603320 MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASE 23A; MMP23A
;;MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASE 21, FORMERLY; MMP21, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The matrix metalloproteinases are secreted glycoproteins that are
involved in the remodeling of the extracellular matrix. By analysis of
the genomic region surrounding the duplicated genes CDC2L1 (176873) and
CDC2L2 (116951), Gururajan et al. (1998) identified 2 novel matrix
metalloproteinase genes, MMP23A, which they called MMP21, and MMP23B
(603321), which they called MMP22. The nucleotide sequences of MMP21 and
MMP22 are nearly identical. Using a combination of techniques, the
authors isolated cDNAs corresponding to alternatively spliced
transcripts that encode 3 protein isoforms, MMP21/22A, MMP21/22B, and
MMP21/22C. The MMP21 and MMP22 proteins contain prepro-, catalytic,
cysteine-rich, IL1R (147810)-related, and proline-rich domains. Northern
blot analysis revealed that a 1.4-kb MMP21/22 transcript was expressed
in heart, placenta, ovary, testis, and prostate. A 0.8-kb mRNA was
detected in heart and pancreas, and an additional 2.4-kb mRNA was
detected in ovary.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gururajan et al. (1998) determined that the MMP21 and MMP22 genes
contain 8 exons each, and the exons generally correspond to the
structural domains of the putative protein products.

MAPPING

Gururajan et al. (1998) reported that the MMP21 and MMP22 genes are
located within an approximately 140-kb region on chromosome 1p36.3. This
region consists of 2 identical genomic segments, each of which contains
a CDC2L gene linked to an MMP gene. The 3-prime end of the MMP gene is
500 to 800 bp from the 3-prime end of the adjacent CDC2L gene. The genes
are arranged in the order
telomere--MMP22--CDC2L2--CDC2L1--MMP21--centromere. The 2 CDC2L genes
are separated by approximately 50 kb. Gururajan et al. (1998) stated
that although the functional significance of the reiteration of selected
genes within the 1p36.3 region is not known, it might reflect
instability relevant to the observed deletion of 1p36 during
tumorigenesis.

602137	TITLE *602137 NADH-UBIQUINONE OXIDOREDUCTASE 1 ALPHA SUBCOMPLEX, 2; NDUFA2
;;B8 PROTEIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The NDUFA2 gene encodes one of the accessory subunits of complex I, the
first and largest complex of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (Hoefs
et al., 2008).

For a discussion of complex I, see 516000.

CLONING

Dunbar et al. (1997) reported the genomic cloning and fluorescence in
situ hybridization mapping of 5 nuclear-encoded human complex I genes.

Ton et al. (1997) isolated human heart cDNAs encoding the CI-B8, CI-SGDH
(603841), CI-B14 (602138), CI-B12 (603839), and CI-KFYI (603844)
subunits of the HP fraction. Human and bovine B8 protein shared 94%
sequence identity.

Loeffen et al. (1998) noted that complex I can be fragmented into 3
different fractions. The flavoprotein fraction contains the NDUFV1
(161015), NDUFV2 (600532), and NDUFV3 (602184) subunits and the
iron-sulfur protein (IP) fraction contains at least 7 subunits,
NDUFS1-NDUFS6 (see, e.g., 157655) and NDUFA5 (601677). The remaining
subunits, including NDUFA2, are part of the hydrophobic protein (HP)
fraction, which is involved in proton translocation. Loeffen et al.
(1998) reported cDNA sequences of 8 nuclear-encoded subunits located
within the hydrophobic protein fraction of NADH:ubiquinone
oxidoreductase.

MAPPING

Dunbar et al. (1997) mapped NDUFA2 to chromosome 5q31. Emahazion and
Brookes (1998) showed that of the 5 complex I genes mapped by Dunbar et
al. (1997), only the mapping of NDUFA2 was correct. (See NDUFA6
(602138), NDUFA7 (602139), NDUFB8 (602140), and NDUFS8 (602141).)

By intron-based radiation hybrid mapping, Emahazion and Brookes (1998)
mapped the NDUFA2 gene to chromosome 5q31.2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a boy with Leigh syndrome (256000) due to mitochondrial complex I
deficiency (252010), Hoefs et al. (2008) identified a homozygous splice
site mutation in the NDUFA2 gene (602137.0001).

NOMENCLATURE

Mammalian complex I has been studied extensively in Bos taurus. The
names of some the bovine complex I subunits designate the single-letter
code for the 4 N-terminal amino acids (e.g., SGDH). The names of
subunits B8-B22 designate their molecular weights (Walker et al., 1992).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
LEIGH SYNDROME DUE TO MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX I DEFICIENCY
NDUFA2, IVS2DS, G-A, +5

In a Turkish boy with Leigh syndrome (256000) due to mitochondrial
complex I deficiency (252010), born of first-cousin parents, Hoefs et
al. (2008) identified a homozygous G-to-A transition in intron 2 of the
NDUFA2 gene, resulting in the skipping of exon 2 and generation of a
prematurely truncated protein, which was confirmed by PCR analysis. He
had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and developmental delay from birth, and
brain MRI showed cerebral atrophy and hypoplasia of the corpus callosum.
After a varicella infection, he developed severe acidosis, seizures, and
coma, and died of cardiovascular arrest at age 11 months. MRI just
before death showed demyelinization of corticospinal tracts and subacute
necrotizing encephalomyelopathy consistent with Leigh syndrome. The
fibroblast and muscle complex I enzymatic activities were 36% and 20% of
control values, respectively. Further studies showed that the NDUFA2
mutation resulted in disturbed assembly and stability of complex I and
decreased complex I activity. In patient fibroblasts, the defect could
be corrected with a baculoviral vector.

600178	TITLE *600178 MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1A; MAP1A
;;MTAP1A
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The assembly of microtubules, an essential step in neurogenesis, is
modulated by a family of molecules called microtubule-associated
proteins (MAPs). These proteins have been divided into 2 main groups by
molecular mass, high molecular weight MAPs, which include MAP1A, MAP1B
(157129), and MAP2 (157130), and another group of intermediate-sized
proteins, which include the abundant tau MAPs. MAP1B, also named MAP5,
is a component of long cross-bridges between microtubules and is a
filamentous molecule with a small spherical segment at one end.

Langkopf et al. (1992) determined the deduced amino acid sequence for
the MAP1A heavy chain from a series of overlapping cDNA clones. The cDNA
encoding MAP1A also encodes one of the MAP1A heavy chain's associated
light chains, LC2.

Lien et al. (1994) completely cloned and sequenced the human MAP1B gene.
By comparison of human MAP1B with sequence databases, they identified a
MAP1B-related gene that is probably the human homolog of rat MAP1A. The
human MAP1A gene is expressed at high levels in brain and spinal cord
and at much lower levels in muscle.

GENE STRUCTURE

The MAP1A/LC2 gene is organized in a similar fashion to that of the gene
encoding both MAP1B and LC1 (Hammarback et al., 1991). The encoded
precursor polypeptide presumably undergoes proteolytic processing to
generate the final MAP1A heavy chain and LC2 polypeptides. Fink et al.
(1996) showed that the MAP1A gene contains 5 exons and spans about 10.5
kb. The predicted human and rat proteins are remarkably similar.

MAPPING

Lien et al. (1994) mapped the MAP1A gene to 15q by PCR amplification of
genomic DNA purified from somatic cell hybrid lines and further
sublocalized it using a deletion panel from chromosome 15, 15q13-qter.

GENE FUNCTION

Ikeda et al. (2002) identified the MAP1A gene as the 'modifier of tubby
hearing-1' (moth1) QTL associated with hearing loss in tubby mutants on
the C57BL/6J background. The Map1a cDNA derived from B6 contained 12
single-nucleotide differences which could lead to amino acid alterations
and a difference in the length of a repeat in the open reading frame
when compared with that found in the AKR strain. Ikeda et al. (2002)
used a transgenic rescue experiment to verify that sequence
polymorphisms were crucial for hearing loss phenotype and demonstrated
that the polymorphisms changed the binding efficiency of MAP1A to PSD95
(602887), a core component in the cytoarchitecture of synapses. This
indicates that at least some of the observed polymorphisms are
functionally important and that the hearing loss of C57BL/6J-tub/tub
mice may be caused by impaired protein interactions involving MTAP1A.

601783	TITLE *601783 MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 6; MAP6
;;MTAP6;;
STABLE TUBULE-ONLY POLYPEPTIDE; STOP;;
KIAA1878
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Mammalian cells often contain abundant subpopulations of microtubules
that are stable to both drug- and cold temperature-induced disassembly.
Such microtubules are apparently universal in the neurite extensions of
neuronal cells. Bosc et al. (1996) cloned and characterized the gene
encoding a rat protein that reconstitutes microtubule cold stability in
vitro. The protein, called stable tubule-only polypeptide (STOP) by
them, is a 100.5-kD polypeptide. The central region of the predicted
952-amino acid polypeptide contains 5 tandem repeats of 46 amino acids.
STOP also contains a putative SH3-binding motif near its N terminus.

Denarier et al. (1998) determined that the deduced mouse Map6 protein
contains 906 amino acids and has a calculated molecular mass of about
96.4 kD.

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult hippocampus
cDNA library, Nagase et al. (2001) cloned MAP6, which they designated
KIAA1878. The transcript contains a repetitive element in the 3-prime
UTR. RT-PCR ELISA detected highest MAP6 expression in fetal brain,
followed by spinal cord, adult brain, testis, kidney, lung, heart, and
ovary. Lower expression was detected in pancreas, spleen, and skeletal
muscle, and little to no expression was detected in adult and fetal
liver. All specific brain regions showed intermediate to high
expression, with highest expression in caudate nucleus, hippocampus, and
cerebellum.

GENE FUNCTION

Bosc et al. (1996) found that in vitro-translated STOP bound to
microtubules and calmodulin (114180). When STOP cDNA was expressed in
HeLa cells, which lack cold-stable microtubules, the protein product
associated with microtubules at 37 degrees C and stabilized microtubule
networks, which induced cold stability, nocodazole resistance, and
tubulin detyrosination.

GENE STRUCTURE

Denarier et al. (1998) determined that the mouse Map6 gene contains 4
exons and spans about 40 kb. The 5-prime flanking region lacks a TATA
box or an initiator element.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2001) mapped the MAP6 gene
to chromosome 11. Jolly et al. (1999) reported a conflicting assignment
of the human MAP6 gene to chromosome 6p12-p11 by FISH. However, Andrieux
et al. (2002) confirmed that the human MAP6 gene maps to chromosome
11q14.

Using FISH, Denarier et al. (1998) mapped the mouse Map6 gene to region
E2-F1 of chromosome 7, which shows homology of synteny to human
chromosome 11.

ANIMAL MODEL

Andrieux et al. (2002) found that Stop-null mice had no detectable
defects in brain anatomy, but they showed synaptic defects, with
depleted synaptic vesicle pools and impaired synaptic plasticity,
associated with severe behavioral disorders. A survey of the effects of
psychotropic drugs on the behavior of Stop-null mice showed a specific
effect of long-term administration of neuroleptics in alleviating these
disorders.

database searching, and screening a monocytoid cDNA library, Blencowe et
al. (1998) isolated cDNAs encoding SRM160 (SR-related matrix protein of
160 kD) and several isoforms. The deduced 820-amino acid protein is rich
in SR/RS repeats and proline residues. SRM160 also has multiple putative
phosphorylation sites and SH3-binding motifs but no RNA-recognition
domains. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a ubiquitous,
variably expressed 3.8-kb transcript and a more restricted 6.0-kb
transcript. Immunoblot analysis showed that the recombinant protein was
expressed as a 160-kD protein in nuclear extract and that it could be
reduced to a 120-kD protein by phosphatase treatment. Confocal
microscopy demonstrated expression of SRM160 in nuclear speckles.
Immunoprecipitation analysis detected interaction of SRM160 with SRM300
(606032), a nuclear matrix antigen, and 2 other SR proteins, SRp40
(600914) and SRp75 (601940). EMSA analysis indicated that SRM160/SRM300
associates with pre-mRNA and promotes splicing through interactions with
SR family proteins. The association between SRM160/SRM300 and pre-mRNA
is dependent on RNU1 (180680) and is stabilized by RNU2 (180690).

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SRM160
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP RH40469).

;;LDH, TESTICULAR FORM; LDHX
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Zinkham et al. (1964) found a distinctive LDH isozyme in mature testes
of many species including man. It is polymorphic in the pigeon, and one
can infer that a locus separate from LDHA (150000) and LDHB (150100)
controls it. The same is almost certainly true in the human. This is a
gene that functions only in one sex and only in one tissue.

Sakai et al. (1987) isolated and sequenced cDNA clones of LDHC from the
mouse. Northern blot analysis of poly(A)-containing RNAs from mouse
testes and liver indicated that the Ldhc gene was expressed in testes
but not in liver. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of mouse Ldhc
showed 73 and 72% homology, respectively, with those of mouse Ldha.
Southern blot analysis of genomic DNAs from mouse liver and human
placenta indicated the presence of multiple LDH-C gene-related
sequences. From the amino acid sequence deduced from cDNA, Millan et al.
(1987) found that human LDHC is as different from rodent Ldhc (73%
homology) as it is from human LDHA (76% homology) and porcine LDHB (68%
homology).

MAPPING

Zinkham et al. (1969) found that the LDHB and LDHC loci are closely
linked in pigeons. Edwards et al. (1987) used an LDHC cDNA to analyze
genomic DNA from rodent/human somatic cell hybrids. These showed that
LDHA and LDHC are syntenic on human chromosome 11. The assignment of
LDHC was confirmed by Kao et al. (1988), who localized the gene to
11p15.5-p14.3 by use of somatic cell hybrids and in situ chromosome
hybridization. Li et al. (1988) also assigned LDHC to chromosome 11 by
hybridization of DNA from flow-sorted chromosomes. The close physical
proximity of the LDHC and LDHA genes supports the evolutionary
relatedness of the 2 isozymes. Edwards et al. (1989) reported mapping of
LDHC to 11p15.5-p15.3 by combination of somatic cell hybrid studies and
in situ hybridization.

614235	TITLE *614235 PDZ DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 8; PDZD8
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PDZD8 is a cytoskeletal regulatory protein that interacts with moesin
(MSN; 309845) and regulates stable microtubule abundance. Both MSN and
PDZD8 suppress herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 infection, but PDZD8 also
promotes human immunodeficiency (HIV)-1 infection (see 609423) (Henning
et al., 2010, 2011).

CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of a human testis cDNA library with HIV-1
Gag as bait, Henning et al. (2010) cloned PDZD8. The predicted
1,154-amino acid protein contains a PDZ domain, a zinc finger domain,
and a coiled-coil motif.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid screening, Henning et al. (2010) showed that PDZD8
amino acids 932 to 1119, including the coiled-coil motif, interacted
with HIV-1 Gag amino acids 59 to 250. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis
confirmed the interaction. Overexpression of PDZD8 in human cells
promoted initiation of retroviral transcription and HIV-1 infection,
whereas knockdown of PDZD8 decreased HIV-1 infection. A PDZD8 mutant
lacking the coiled-coil domain failed to bind Gag and promote HIV-1
infection.

By yeast 2-hybrid screening and coimmunoprecipitation analysis, Henning
et al. (2011) found that amino acids 990 to 1155 of human PDZD8
interacted with amino acids 158 to 279 of moesin. Expression of PDZD8 or
moesin reduced the levels of stable microtubules in the human CHME3
microglial cell line. In addition, expression of PDZD8 or moesin reduced
the cytopathic effects of HSV-1, as well as HSV-1 replication and
spread, in CHME3 cells.

MAPPING

Gross (2011) mapped the PDZD8 gene to chromosome 10q25.3-q26.11 based on
an alignment of the PDZD8 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC028375) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

601546	TITLE *601546 PROSPERO-RELATED HOMEOBOX 1; PROX1
;;HOMEOBOX GENE PROX1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Zinovieva et al. (1996) described the isolation of a human gene that is
homologous to the mouse Prox1 homeotic gene. PCR probes corresponding to
the mouse Prox1 gene were used to screen human genomic DNA libraries.
PCR probes corresponding to human PROX1 cDNA were used to screen fetal
brain cDNA libraries. Comparison of the human and chicken PROX1
nucleotide sequence demonstrated that they are highly conserved, with
overall homology of 94%. In the region of the homeodomain and the
prospero domain, the genes were identical. The prospero domain coincides
with a domain in a Drosophila gene that is expressed in Drosophila
central nervous system and in the developing lens-secreting cone cells
of the eye. Exon 1 of the human sequence showed no clear similarity to
the 3 alternatively spliced variants of chicken PROX1 cDNA. Human PROX1
exon 1 was found to contain repetitive sequences. Analysis of mRNA
revealed that Prox mRNA was present in many different human tissues and
that lens demonstrated the highest level. In all tissues but lens, PROX1
cDNA hybridized to a single band of 8 kb. In the embryonic lens an
additional component of 2 kb was present which appears to be derived by
alternative splicing. Zinovieva et al. (1996) noted that since the cDNA
isolated by them was only 2,924 bp and the mRNA transcript was 8.0 kb,
significant portions of the 5-prime and 3-prime untranslated regions of
the cDNA remained uncloned.

GENE STRUCTURE

Using combined analysis of cDNA and genomic DNA clones, Zinovieva et al.
(1996) found that the PROX1 gene is composed of at least 5 exons and 4
introns.

MAPPING

Zinovieva et al. (1996) mapped the PROX1 gene to chromosome 1 by
analysis of somatic cell hybrids. They also reported that the PROX1 gene
maps within a YAC contig that maps to chromosome 1q32.2-q32.3. Zinovieva
et al. (1996) reported that Usher syndrome type II (276901) maps close
to this region on chromosome 1 and that PROX1 can be considered as a
candidate gene for this disorder.

GENE FUNCTION

Wigle and Oliver (1999) reported that the Prox1 gene is expressed in a
subpopulation of endothelial cells that by budding and sprouting give
rise to the lymphatic system. The initial localization of these cells in
the veins and their subsequent budding were both polarized, suggesting
that unidentified guidance signals regulate this process. In Prox1-null
mice, budding and sprouting were arrested, although vasculogenesis and
angiogenesis of the vascular system were unaffected. These findings
suggested that Prox1 is a specific and required regulator of the
development of the lymphatic system and that the vascular and lymphatic
systems develop independently.

Several genes are required during the early phases of liver
specification, proliferation, and differentiation. Sosa-Pineda et al.
(2000) reported that Prox1 is required for hepatocyte migration in the
mouse. Loss of Prox1 led to formation of a smaller liver with a reduced
population of clustered hepatocytes surrounded by a laminin-rich basal
membrane.

Retinal progenitor cells regulate their proliferation during development
so that the correct number of each cell type is made at the appropriate
time. Dyer et al. (2003) found that the homeodomain protein Prox1
regulates the exit of progenitor cells from the cell cycle in the
embryonic mouse retina. Cells lacking Prox1 are less likely to stop
dividing, and ectopic expression of Prox1 forces progenitor cells to
exit the cell cycle. Other observations indicated that Prox1 activity is
both necessary and sufficient for progenitor-cell proliferation and
cell-fate determination in the vertebrate retina.

Francois et al. (2008) demonstrated that Sox18 (601618) acts as a
molecular switch to induce differentiation of lymphatic endothelial
cells. Sox18 is expressed in a subset of cardinal vein cells that later
coexpress Prox1 and migrate to form lymphatic vessels. Sox18 directly
activates Prox1 transcription by binding to its proximal promoter.

Johnson et al. (2008) showed that differentiation of lymphatic
endothelial cells in mice is a plastic and reprogrammable process that
depends on constant Prox1 activity. Small interfering RNA-mediated
downregulation of Prox1 in cultured lymphatic endothelial cells or
conditional downregulation of Prox1 during embryonic, postnatal, or
adult stages was sufficient to reprogram lymphatic endothelial cells
into blood endothelial cells.

Kazenwadel et al. (2010) identified a microRNA-181 (MIR181; see
612742)-binding sequence that was 100% conserved in the 3-prime ends of
human, mouse, rat, and chicken PROX1 transcripts. Mouse Mir181a bound
the 3-prime sequence of Prox1, inhibited its translation, and caused its
degradation. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analysis
showed reciprocal expression of Mir181a and Prox1 in embryonic mouse
lens and retina and in adult and embryonic blood and lymphatic
endothelial cells. Overexpression of Mir181a in embryonic lymphatic
endothelial cells caused degradation of Prox1 mRNA, reducing Prox1
protein expression and causing reprogramming of lymphatic endothelial
cells toward a blood vascular phenotype. Conversely, treatment of
primary embryonic blood vascular endothelial cells with an Mir181a
antagomir increased Prox1 mRNA levels. Kazenwadel et al. (2010)
concluded that MIR181A has a role in embryonic vascular development by
controlling PROX1 gene expression.

ANIMAL MODEL

The expression pattern of the Prox1 homeobox gene suggests that it has a
role in a variety of embryonic tissues, including lens. To analyze the
requirement for Prox1 during mammalian development, Wigle et al. (1999)
inactivated the locus in mice. Homozygous Prox1-null mice died at
midgestation from multiple developmental defects. Wigle et al. (1999)
described a specific effect on lens development. Prox1 inactivation
caused abnormal cellular proliferation, downregulated expression of the
cell cycle inhibitors Cdkn1b (600778) and Cdkn1c (600856), misexpression
of E-cadherin (192090), and inappropriate apoptosis. Consequently,
mutant lens cells failed to polarize and elongate properly, resulting in
a hollow lens. The data provided evidence that the progression of
terminal fiber differentiation and elongation is dependent on Prox1
activity during lens development.

Multiple organs cooperate to regulate appetite, metabolism, and glucose
and fatty acid homeostasis. Harvey et al. (2005) identified and
characterized lymphatic vasculature dysfunction as a cause of
adult-onset obesity. They found that functional inactivation of a single
allele of the homeobox gene Prox1 in mice led to adult-onset obesity due
to abnormal lymph leakage from mispatterned and ruptured lymphatic
vessels. They proposed that Prox1 heterozygous mice are a model for
adult-onset obesity and lymphatic vascular disease. They proposed that
there is crosstalk between the lymphatic vasculature and adipose tissue.
They proposed a model in which lymph linkage promotes adipose tissue
accumulation in 2 phases: first, increased storage of leaking lipids in
existing adipocytes causes adipocyte hypertrophy; and second, once the
adipocytes reach maximum lipid storage capacity, the promotion of
preadipocyte differentiation results in adipocyte hyperplasia in older
and more obese mice. Harvey et al. (2005) suggested that in the human,
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes associated with
lymphatic development could predispose individuals to adult-onset
obesity.

602835	TITLE *602835 GROWTH ARREST-SPECIFIC 2; GAS2
DESCRIPTION Schneider et al. (1988) identified a group of genes that are highly
expressed during growth arrest in murine fibroblasts. Brancolini et al.
(1992) characterized one of those genes, Gas2. Using immunofluorescence,
they found that Gas2 is a component of the microfilament system. Gas2
colocalizes with actin fibers at the cell border and along the stress
fibers in growth-arrested mouse fibroblasts. On Western blots of both
human and mouse fibroblast extracts, antibodies against Gas2 recognized
a 36-kD protein. By screening a human kidney library with a fragment of
the mouse Gas2 cDNA, Collavin et al. (1998) isolated cDNAs encoding
human GAS2. The predicted 313-amino acid human protein differs in only 8
residues from mouse Gas2. When expressed in mammalian cells, human GAS2
localized at the actin cytoskeleton, along the stress fibers and at the
plasma membrane. Like the mouse protein, GAS2 is proteolytically cleaved
in apoptotic cells. Using RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, Collavin et
al. (1998) determined that GAS2 was expressed in most of the tissues
analyzed, with the highest levels of protein found in liver, lung, and
kidney.

Colombo et al. (1992) showed that the Gas2 gene is linked to markers on
mouse chromosome 7. By fluorescence in situ hybridization and by
analysis of a radiation hybrid panel, Collavin et al. (1998) mapped the
human GAS2 gene to 11p15.2-p14.3, a region that has homology of synteny
with mouse chromosomal band 7C.

611007	TITLE *611007 MEX3, C. ELEGANS, HOMOLOG OF, A; MEX3A
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

C. elegans Mex3 is a regulator of translation that specifies posterior
blastomere identity in the early embryo and contributes to the
maintenance of germline totipotency. By database analysis and RT-PCR,
Buchet-Poyau et al. (2007) cloned a family of 4 human genes homologous
to C. elegans Mex3, including MEX3A. Like the other human MEX3 proteins,
the deduced 520-amino acid MEX3A protein has an N-terminal nuclear
export signal (NES), 2 heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K
(HNRNPK; 600712) homology (KH) domains, and a C-terminal RING finger
domain. The KH domains are present in C. elegans Mex3, but not the RING
domain. RT-PCR detected variable expression of MEX3A in human tissues
and cell lines, with highest levels in fetal brain and testis.

GENE FUNCTION

Using Western blot analysis of transfected human embryonic kidney cells
and kinase assays, Buchet-Poyau et al. (2007) showed that MEX3A, MEX3B
(611008), and MEX3C (611005) were phosphoproteins. RNA
homopolymer-binding assays and immunoprecipitation analysis revealed
that MEX3A, MEX3B, and MEX3C bound RNA via their KH domains in vitro and
in vivo. Immunofluorescence analysis of transfected breast cancer cells
showed that MEX3A, MEX3B, and MEX3C shuttled between the nucleus and
cytoplasm in an NES-dependent manner. MEX3A and MEX3B colocalized with
DCP1A (607010) decapping factor and argonaute proteins (e.g., AGO1;
606228) in processing (P) bodies, which are centers for mRNA turnover.
Buchet-Poyau et al. (2007) proposed that MEX3 proteins may function in
maintenance of pluripotent cells, i.e., stem cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Buchet-Poyau et al. (2007) determined that the MEX3A gene contains 2
exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Buchet-Poyau et al. (2007) mapped the
MEX3A gene to chromosome 1q22.

;;CHORD DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; CHP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Shirasu et al. (1999) cloned the cDNA of a human gene, designated CHP1,
that encodes a 332-amino acid protein containing 2 CHORD domains. CHORD
was defined as a 60-amino acid, cysteine- and histidine-rich,
Zn(2+)-binding domain that is conserved in tandem organization in
protozoa, plants, and metazoa.

GENE FUNCTION

Shirasu et al. (1999) found that silencing of the C. elegans
CHORD-containing gene, chp, resulted in semisterility and embryo
lethality, suggesting an essential function of the wildtype gene in
nematode development.

613137	TITLE *613137 TETRASPANIN 9; TSPAN9
;;NEW EST TETRASPAN 5; NET5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the tetraspanin superfamily, such as TSPAN9, are
characterized by the presence of 4 transmembrane domains. Tetraspanins
associate in large membrane complexes with other molecules, particularly
integrins (see ITGB1; 135630), and function in cell adhesion, migration,
and signaling (summary by Serru et al., 2000).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for tetraspanin-like sequences, followed by
5-prime RACE of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Serru et al. (2000) cloned
TSPAN9, which they called NET5. The deduced 239-amino acid protein
contains 4 transmembrane segments and other characteristics of a
tetraspanin. RT-PCR detected TSPAN9 expression in all human cell lines
examined.

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the TSPAN9 gene to chromosome 12p13.32 based on an
alignment of the TSPAN9 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF217967) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

609951	TITLE *609951 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 384; ZNF384
;;CAS-INTERACTING ZINC FINGER PROTEIN; CIZ;;
CAGH1;;
NUCLEAR MATRIX PROTEIN 4; NMP4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ZNF384 is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein that localizes at
fibroblast focal adhesions, contains multiple zinc fingers, and
regulates expression of matrix metalloproteinases (e.g., MMP3; 185250)
(Thunyakitpisal et al., 2001).

CLONING

By screening adult and fetal human brain cDNA libraries for clones
containing CAG repeats, Margolis et al. (1997) isolated a partial cDNA
encoding ZNF384, which they called CAGH1.

By Far Western screening of a rat embryonic fibroblast cDNA library with
the SH3 domain of Cas (BCAR1; 602941) as probe, Nakamoto et al. (2000)
isolated several splice variants of Znf384, which they called Ciz. The
longest variant encodes a predicted 579-residue protein with an
N-terminal leucine zipper, multiple serine and proline residues, a
nuclear localization signal, 8 centrally located Kruppel-type C2H2 zinc
fingers, and C-terminal glutamine-alanine and glutamine repeat regions,
suggesting that Ciz may be a transcription factor. The shorter variants
encode proteins with only 5 or 6 zinc fingers. Northern blot analysis of
rat tissues revealed ubiquitous expression of a 3.0-kb transcript, with
highest levels in testis, heart, kidney, and brain. A 4.0-kb transcript
was also detected in brain, liver, and kidney. Immunofluorescence
microscopy showed that Ciz shuttled in and out of the nucleus and
localized at stably formed focal adhesions and in the nucleus.

Thunyakitpisal et al. (2001) independently cloned and characterized rat
Znf384, which they termed Nmp4, based on its interaction with type I
collagen alpha-1 (COL1A1; 120150). They identified several novel
variants, including one that lacks the C-terminal glutamine-alanine
repeat region.

GENE FUNCTION

Using precipitation analysis, Nakamoto et al. (2000) showed that rat Ciz
bound specifically and constitutively to the SH3 domain of Cas.
Immunoprecipitation and EMSA analysis demonstrated that Ciz bound to the
promoter of human MMP1 (120353) and upregulated transcription of human
MMP1 and MMP7 (178990) and rat Mmp3.

Thunyakitpisal et al. (2001) showed that rat Nmp4 interacted with Col1a1
and regulated its expression in osteoblasts. They concluded that NMP4
contributes to extracellular matrix turnover in bone and other tissues.

Shen et al. (2002) overexpressed Ciz in a mouse osteoblast cell line and
found that it inhibited Bmp2 (112261)-induced expression of alkaline
phosphatase (see ALPL; 171760), osteocalcin (BGLAP; 112260), type I
collagen, and Cbfa1 (RUNX2; 600211). They concluded that CIZ is an
inhibitory protein that modulates BMP2-induced differentiation of
osteoblastic cells.

MAPPING

Margolis et al. (1997) stated that the ZFN384 gene maps to chromosome
12p12. Alvarez et al. (2001) mapped the mouse Znf384 gene to chromosome
6F1, a region that shows homology of synteny to human chromosome 12p12.

ANIMAL MODEL

Morinobu et al. (2005) found that Ciz -/- mice had increased bone volume
and rates of bone formation, but no alteration in bone resorption. Ciz
-/- mice expressed higher levels of mRNA for proteins involved in
osteoblastic phenotypes, such as alkaline phosphatase and osterix (SP7;
606633). Ciz deficiency increased newly formed bone mass after femoral
bone marrow ablation, and it increased Bmp2-induced bone formation in
adult mouse calvariae. Morinobu et al. (2005) concluded that CIZ
suppresses the levels of adult bone mass through inhibition of
BMP-induced activation of osteoblasts.
