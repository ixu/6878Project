;;TPI
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Triosephosphate isomerase (TPI; EC 5.3.1.1) catalyzes the
interconversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (summary by Ationu et al., 1999).

CLONING

Electrophoretic variants of triosephosphate isomerase were identified by
the Galton Laboratory group (Hopkinson and Harris, 1971).

Brown et al. (1985) isolated the functional gene and 3 intronless
pseudogenes for human TPI from a recombinant DNA library. The
pseudogenes share a high degree of homology with the functional gene but
contain mutations that preclude synthesis of active TPI enzyme. Sequence
divergence indicated origin of the pseudogenes about 18 million years
ago. Brown et al. (1985) concluded that the human TPI gene family has
only 1 functional gene.

Yuan et al. (1979), on the basis of structural analysis, concluded that
the TPI-A and TPI-B isozymes are products of distinct structural loci.
Decker and Mohrenweiser (1981) presented evidence that triosephosphate
isomerase isozymes are the expression of a single structural locus. (The
existence of 2 TPI loci, both probably coded by chromosome 12, had been
suggested to explain the observed isozyme patterns.) They identified a
rare electrophoretic variant and found that the variant phenotype was
expressed in the TPI-B isozyme of both red cells and circulating
lymphocytes and was also expressed in the TPI-A isozyme of
mitogen-stimulated lymphoblasts.

GENE FUNCTION

TPI is a dimeric enzyme of identical subunits that is characterized by a
high constitutive level of activity in all tissues. It is involved in
both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, catalyzing the interconversion of
DHAP and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. TPI is one of the most efficient
enzymes known, enhancing proton transfer by a factor of 10(10), and is
the least rate-limiting step in glycolysis (summary by Watanabe et al.,
1996).

GENE STRUCTURE

Brown et al. (1985) found that the functional TPI1 gene spans 3.5 kb and
is split into 7 exons.

MAPPING

From study of 3 patients with different deletions of chromosome 12,
Rethore et al. (1976, 1977) concluded that the GAPD locus (138400) is on
the distal part of 12p, between 12p12.2 and 12pter, and that the LDHB
locus (150100) is on the middle third between 12p12.1 and 12p12.2. The
results for TPI were like those for GAPD, suggesting the same distal
localization.

Law and Kao (1978) summarized data suggesting the order
12pter--TPI--GAPD--SHMT (SHMT2; 138450) on chromosome 12. SHMT lies on
the proximal part of 12q between the centromere and PEPB (169900).

Brown et al. (1985) confirmed that the functional TPI gene is on
chromosome 12 whereas the pseudogenes are on other chromosomes.

Asakawa and Iida (1985) also found support for a single TPI locus. GPI
(172400) and PEPD (613230), which are on chromosome 19 in man, are on
chromosome 9 of the Chinese hamster, and TPI, which is on chromosome 12
of man, is on Chinese hamster chromosome 8 (Siciliano et al., 1983).

OTHER FEATURES

TPI was 1 of 4 representative 'ancient' proteins used by Stoltzfus et
al. (1994) to test the exon theory of genes. Spliceosomal introns are
present in the nuclear protein-coding genes of most eukaryotic
organisms, but they have not been detected in several eukaryotic protist
phyla or in eubacteria, archaebacteria, and organelles. Two major
theories had emerged in the continuing debate on the origin of these
introns. The exon theory of genes (sometimes called the introns-early
view) proposed that exons are the descendants of ancient mini-genes and
introns are the descendants of the spaces between them; genes large
enough to encode contemporary proteins were first assembled from sets of
exons; the machinery of splicing originated in an ancient RNA world; and
introns were lost completely from both kingdoms of bacteria as well as
several protist groups. In contrast, the insertional theory of intron
origin (also known as the introns-late view) holds that split genes
arise from uninterrupted genes by insertion of introns; genes large
enough to encode contemporary proteins first arose (presumably from
smaller genes) without the participation of introns; the machinery of
spliceosomal splicing arose from fragmented self-splicing introns; and
spliceosomal introns were never present in the ancestors of those
organisms that now lack them. The analysis performed by Stoltzfus et al.
(1994) on TPI, the globins, pyruvate kinase, and alcohol dehydrogenase
demonstrated no significant correspondence between exons and units of
protein structure, suggesting that the putative correspondence does not
exist and that the exon theory of genes is untenable.

The chicken-and-egg question of which came first--exons or introns--was
studied, using TPI as a model, also by Kwiatowski et al. (1995) and
Logsdon et al. (1995). Each group looked at the positions of introns in
homologous TPI genes from a number of phylogenetically diverse species.
Both groups concluded that introns were gained comparatively recently in
eukaryotic evolution by insertion into preexisting genes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Eber et al. (1979) identified 5 persons heterozygous for a TPI null
allele.

Maquat et al. (1985) concluded that the genetic basis of TPI deficiency
is heterogeneous: normal levels of TPI mRNA were found in 1 homozygote
and about 40% of normal in another. The rare homozygous deficient
persons usually have 3 to 10% of normal enzyme activity.

Daar et al. (1986) and Pekrun et al. (1995) identified homoygosity for a
glu104-to-asp (E104D; 190450.0001) mutation in the TPI1 gene in patients
with triosephosphate deficiency. Arya et al. (1997) found that among 7
unrelated Northern European kindreds with clinical TPI deficiency, the
glu104-to-asp mutation accounted for 11 of 14 (79%) mutant alleles.
Haplotype analysis supported a founder effect.

Studies by Boyer et al. (1989) and Boyer and Maquat (1990) identified
several sequences in the 5-prime region that appear to be required for
maintenance of normal levels of gene expression. These include a CAP
proximal element (CPE) spanning nucleotides -6 and -12. The -5A-G and
-8G-A substitutions identified by Watanabe et al. (1996) are located
within the CPE region. The observation that all 7 affected individuals
shared the same variant CPE allele, an allele that does not exist at
higher frequency in the general African American population, suggested
to the authors a common origin for this TPI-deficiency allele; how the
allele frequency is maintained at such a high level was unclear.

Watanabe et al. (1996) undertook the molecular characterization of the
variant alleles from 7 African American and 3 Caucasian individuals from
the unrelated group identified in the frequency studies. In Caucasians
they found 3 amino acid substitutions, all in residues that are not
directly involved in the enzyme's active site but are highly conserved
through evolutionary time, suggesting important roles for these residues
in maintenance of subunit structure and conformation. One of the amino
acid substitutions, glu104-to-asp (190450.0001), had been previously
identified in cases of hemolytic anemia due to TPI deficiency. The
variant allele in the 7 African American individuals had nucleotide
changes at positions -8 and -5 on the 5-prime side of the
transcription-initiation site.

In a study of 424 African American subjects and 75 white subjects,
Schneider et al. (1998) found that the -5 (592A-G), -8 (382G-A), and -24
(573T-G) variants in the triosephosphate isomerase gene occurred
frequently (41%) in the African American subjects but did not occur in
whites. These data suggested that this set of polymorphisms may be one
of the higher-incidence molecular markers of African lineage. Although
the variant substitutions (occurring in 3 haplotypes: -5 alone, -5 -8,
and -5 -8 -24) were associated with moderate reduction in enzyme
activity, severe deficiency heterozygotes could not be identified with
certainty, and none of the haplotypes was restricted to subjects with
marked reduction of enzyme activity. Three subjects were homozygous for
the -5 -8 haplotype, a finding inconsistent with the putative role of
this haplotype as the cause of a null variant incompatible with life in
homozygotes, as had been suggested in the past for the rarity of
homozygotes with TPI deficiency in African Americans. Despite these
findings, Schneider et al. (1998) admitted the possibility that the -5
-8 or -5 -8 -24 haplotypes may in some instances contribute to compound
heterozygosity and clinical TPI deficiency.

ANIMAL MODEL

Gnerer et al. (2006) identified a recessive hypomorphic mutation in
Drosophila, which they called 'wasted away' (wstd), that causes
progressive motor impairment, vacuolar neuropathology, and severely
reduced life span. They found that wstd was caused by a mutation in the
Tpi1 gene. The mutation did not result in a significant deficit in ATP,
and the authors suggested that the lack of TPI1 activity may cause the
accumulation of toxic metabolites upstream of the enzymatic block.

HISTORY

From studies in the cri-du-chat syndrome (123450), Sparkes et al. (1969)
suggested that the TPI locus is on the short arm of chromosome 5. Others
failed to confirm this (Brock and Singer, 1970). Cell hybridization
studies indicated that the TPI locus is on chromosome 12.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
TRIOSEPHOSPHATE ISOMERASE DEFICIENCY
TPI1, GLU104ASP

In 2 unrelated patients with TPI deficiency (615512), Daar et al. (1986)
found a guanine-to-cytosine transversion in the codon for amino acid
104, resulting in a structurally altered protein in which a glutamate
residue was replaced by an aspartate residue. The importance of
glutamate-104 to enzyme structure and function was indicated by its
conservation in the TPI protein of all species characterized to date.
The glutamate-to-aspartate substitution resulted in a thermolabile
enzyme. The same mutation was identified in an Australian family by
Chang et al. (1993). The alteration of codon 104 was from GAG to GAC.

Pekrun et al. (1995) found this same mutation in a family with severe
TPI deficiency. The 1-year-old index patient suffered from hemolytic
anemia, neuromuscular impairment, and recurrent pneumonia, with the
necessity of intermittent mechanical ventilation. TPI activity in red
cells was reduced to about 20% of normal. Heat stability of the enzyme
was strongly reduced; concentration of the physiologic substrate,
dihydroxyacetone phosphate, was increased 20-fold due to the metabolic
block. During a second pregnancy, examination of a cord blood sample
obtained in the nineteenth gestational week showed that the infant was
homozygous normal. An unaffected, healthy newborn was delivered. The
parents were consanguineous and of Turkish origin.

Arya et al. (1997) found that among 7 unrelated Northern European
kindreds with clinical TPI deficiency, the glu104-to-asp mutation
accounted for 11 (79%) of 14 mutant alleles. In 3 families, molecular
analysis revealed compound heterozygosity for glu104 to asp and novel
missense mutations (see 190450.0004 and 190450.0005). The origin of the
glu104-to-asp mutation was defined by haplotype analysis using a novel
G/A polymorphism at nucleotide 2898 of the TPI gene. Cosegregation of
the low frequency 2898A allele with the G-to-C base change at nucleotide
315, responsible for the glu104-to-asp amino acid substitution,
supported a single origin for that mutation, i.e., founder effect.

.0002
TRIOSEPHOSPHATE ISOMERASE MANCHESTER
TPI-MANCHESTER
TPI1, GLY122ARG

In a screening of more than 3,400 persons in an Ann Arbor, Michigan,
population, Perry and Mohrenweiser (1992) found only 1 example of a TPI
electromorph variant. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of
polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified DNA products and subsequent
direct sequencing identified a G-to-A transition causing a replacement
of gly122 with arg in this electrophoretic mobility variant of TPI which
was referred to as TPI-Manchester. The substitution was at the amino
terminus or solvent interaction end of the fifth beta sheet of the
alpha/beta barrel structure. TPI-Manchester was found to be thermolabile
but the stability of the variant enzyme was not sensitive to other
denaturants.

.0003
TRIOSEPHOSPHATE ISOMERASE DEFICIENCY
TPI-HUNGARY
TPI1, PHE240LEU

In a Hungarian family, Chang et al. (1993) found that the proband with
TPI deficiency (615512), who had chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia
but no neuromuscular disabilities, was a genetic compound. One of the
mutations was a missense mutation within codon 240 that changed TTC
(phe) to CTC (leu) and created a thermolabile protein. The substitution
occurred in a phylogenetically conserved amino acid and affected enzyme
activity by disrupting intersubunit contacts or substrate binding, as
deduced from enzyme structural studies. The nature of the other mutation
was not identified (see 190450.0006), but it had the effect of reducing
the abundance of TPI mRNA 10- to 20-fold. The same family was also
reported by Hollan et al. (1993) who gave clinical details on the
13-year-old boy with congenital hemolytic anemia and hyperkinetic
torsion dyskinesia associated with severe TPI deficiency, and on his
brother, a 23-year-old amateur wrestler, who also had congenital
hemolytic anemia but no neurologic symptoms. The latter was the proband
in the study of Chang et al. (1993), which demonstrated compound
heterozygosity. (Hollan et al. (1993) incorrectly referred to the
brothers as being double heterozygotes.) Both had less than 10% TPI
activity and a greatly increased dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) level
in their red blood cells. Their TPI had a slow electrophoretic mobility
and was heat unstable. Both parents and a third brother were healthy
heterozygotes. The older brother represented a unique phenotype since
all published homozygotes had severe neurologic alterations from infancy
or early childhood except 1 infant who died at 11 months, probably too
young for neurologic symptoms to be noted. Furthermore, in contrast to
the 2 affected Hungarian brothers, all but 1 homozygote had died before
the age of 6 years.

.0004
TRIOSEPHOSPHATE ISOMERASE DEFICIENCY
TPI1, CYS41TYR

In 2 families with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency (615512), Arya
et al. (1997) found compound heterozygosity for the common glu104-to-asp
mutation (190450.0001) and a previously unknown missense mutation, cys41
to tyr, due to a TGT-to-TAT transition.

.0005
TRIOSEPHOSPHATE ISOMERASE DEFICIENCY
TPI1, ILE170VAL

In a family with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency (615512), Arya et
al. (1997) found that affected individuals showed compound
heterozygosity for the common glu104-to-asp substitution (190450.0001)
and a novel ile170-to-val missense mutation.

.0006
TRIOSEPHOSPHATE ISOMERASE DEFICIENCY
TPI1, GLU145TER

In a Hungarian family with severe TPI deficiency (615512) originally
described by Chang et al. (1993), Orosz et al. (2001) analyzed 2
germline-identical but phenotypically different brothers who were
compound heterozygotes for the F240L mutation (190450.0003) and a
glu145-to-ter (E145X) mutation. The kinetic, thermodynamic, and
associative properties of the recombinant human wildtype and F240L
mutant enzymes were compared with those of TPIs in normal and deficient
erythrocyte hemolysates. The specific activity of the recombinant mutant
enzyme relative to the wildtype was much higher (30%) than expected from
the activity (3%) measured in hemolysates. Comparative studies of the
hemolysate from a British patient with glu104-to-asp (190450.0001)
homozygosity (Ationu et al., 1999) and the platelet lysates from the
Hungarian family suggested that the microcompartmentation of TPI is not
unique for the hemolysates from the Hungarian TPI-deficient brothers.

600367	TITLE *600367 CLEAVAGE STIMULATION FACTOR, 3-PRIME PRE-RNA, SUBUNIT 3, 77-KD; CSTF3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Polyadenylation of mRNA precursors is a complex process that requires
multiple protein factors, including cleavage stimulation factor (CSTF),
a cleavage-polyadenylation specificity factor (see 603052), 2 cleavage
factors, and poly(A)+ polymerase. CSTF is composed of 3 subunits: CSTF1
(600369), CSFT2 (300907), and CSTF3 (Takagaki and Manley, 1994).

CLONING

Takagaki and Manley (1994) cloned human CSTF3, which encodes a 77-kD
protein homologous to Drosophila 'suppressor of forked' (suf) and yeast
Rna14, both of which are involved in mRNA processing.

By searching for genes in a region of chromosome 11 associated with WAGR
syndrome (194072), Gawin et al. (1999) identified and cloned CSTF3.
Northern blot analysis of several human tissues detected a 3.2-kb
transcript predominantly in lung. In mouse, Cstf3 expression was strong
during embryonic development beginning at embryonic day 11 and much
weaker in adult tissues.

MAPPING

By analysis of a PAC contig covering chromosome 11p14.1-p13, Gawin et
al. (1999) mapped the CSTF3 gene to chromosome 11p13, centromeric to the
TR2 gene (DEPDC7; 612294) and telomeric to the G2 gene (C11ORF41;
612297).
