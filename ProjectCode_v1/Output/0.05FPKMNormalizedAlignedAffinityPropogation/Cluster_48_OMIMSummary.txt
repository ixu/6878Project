613357	TITLE *613357 FIBRINOGEN C DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; FIBCD1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

FIBCD1 is a conserved type II transmembrane endocytic receptor that
binds chitin and is located primarily in the intestinal brush border
(Schlosser et al., 2009).

CLONING

By searching databases for L-ficolin (FCN2; 601624) homologs that might
bind acetyl groups, Schlosser et al. (2009) identified human FIBCD1. The
predicted 461-amino acid protein has a 31-amino acid cytoplasmic tail at
its N terminus, followed by a 23-amino acid transmembrane helix and a
408-amino acid ectodomain. The cytoplasmic tail has 2 potential
phosphorylation sites. The ectodomain contains an acetyl group-binding
fibrinogen (see 134820)-related domain (FRED) and sequences with
homology to coiled-coil regions of myosins (see 601478) and
angiopoietins (see 601667). FIBCD1 shares significant homology with
FCN2, M-ficolin (FCN1; 601252), and horseshoe crab tachylectin-5A
(Tl5a). When expressed in HEK293 cells as a secreted protein, the FIBCD1
ectodomain had a molecular mass of 55 kD in the reduced state and 250 kD
in the unreduced state by SDS-PAGE, and chemical cross-linking
experiments showed that it formed disulfide-linked homotetramers. FACS
analysis and confocal microscopy of transfected Chinese hamster ovary
(CHO) cells showed cell surface localization of full-length FIBCD1.
RT-PCR detected FIBCD1 mRNA in nearly all human tissues examined.
Immunohistochemical analysis of human tissues demonstrated high
expression of FIBCD1 in small and large intestine epithelial cells on
the apical surface corresponding to the brush border and in salivary
gland ducts. Little to no expression was detected in stomach epithelial
cells, respiratory cells, and urogenital epithelial cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using ELISA and fluorescence microscopy analysis, Schlosser et al.
(2009) showed that human FIBCD1 could bind to and mediate uptake of
acetylated bovine serum albumin (BSA) in a manner that depended on
calcium or manganese, but not magnesium. Pull-down analysis revealed
that FIBCD1 bound chitin, but not other pathogen-associated molecular
patterns (PAMPs). Schlosser et al. (2009) concluded that FIBCD1 is a
membrane-bound FRED molecule that binds chitin.

By chemical cross-linking and electron microscopy analyses, Thomsen et
al. (2010) showed that FIBCD1 FREDs formed noncovalent tetramers
independent of the coiled-coil. Using surface plasmon resonance and
pull-down assays with mutation analysis, they found that the central
residues in the hydrophobic funnel were necessary for binding of FIBCD1
to acetylated BSA and chitin. Thomsen et al. (2010) concluded that
FIBCD1 FREDs form noncovalent tetramers with an acetyl-binding site
homologous to those of Tl5a and FCN1, but not to that of FCN2.

GENE STRUCTURE

Schlosser et al. (2009) determined that the FIBCD1 gene contains 7 exons
and spans 36 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Schlosser et al. (2009) mapped the FIBCD1
gene to chromosome 9q34.12-q34.13.

607819	TITLE *607819 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 30 (ZINC TRANSPORTER), MEMBER 5; SLC30A5
;;ZINC TRANSPORTER 5; ZNT5;;
ZNT1-LIKE 1; ZTL1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Cragg et al. (2002) identified an EST containing mouse Slc30a5, which
they designated Ztl1. Using this sequence to design primers, they cloned
human ZTL1 by 5-prime RACE of a small intestine cDNA library and by
RT-PCR of a CaCo2 (small intestine cell line) cDNA library. The deduced
523-amino acid protein contains 12 predicted membrane-spanning domains
with extracellular N and C termini. Between transmembrane domains 9 and
10, ZTL1 has a zinc-binding histidine-rich intracellular loop. ZTL1
shares 34% identity with ZNT1 (SLC30A1; 609521) over a 122-amino acid
stretch, and it shares significant homology with several rodent zinc
transporters. Northern blot analysis detected 2.0- and 5.0-kb
transcripts in CaCo2 cell line RNA. RT-PCR of mouse tissues detected
ubiquitous expression, with highest level in kidney and lowest level in
liver.

Using homology with an S. cerevisiae zinc transporter, Kambe et al.
(2002) identified ESTs containing mouse Znt5. Using the mouse ESTs, they
obtained a full-length human ZNT5 cDNA by a combination of rapid cDNA
PCR screening and primer extension technique. The deduced 765-amino acid
protein has 15 predicted membrane-spanning domains and a calculated
molecular mass of about 84 kD. Western blot analysis of the full-length
protein expressed in HeLa cells indicated an apparent molecular mass of
about 55 kD. Northern blot analysis detected ubiquitous expression of 3-
and 4-kb transcripts, with highest expression in pancreas, followed by
kidney and liver. Immunohistochemical examination of pancreas showed
colocalization of ZNT5 with insulin (176730) in beta cells, and electron
microscopy revealed association of ZNT5 with secretory granule
membranes. ZNT5 expressed by transfected HeLa cells localized in Golgi
membranes.

GENE FUNCTION

By heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes, Cragg et al. (2002)
confirmed zinc transport by ZTL1. Zn(2+) uptake across oocyte membranes
was saturable and pH dependent.

Kambe et al. (2002) determined that ZNT5 expressed in HeLa cell Golgi
membranes mediated Zn(2+) transport. Transport was temperature- and
concentration-dependent and was saturable. Yeast expressing ZNT5 showed
poor growth in medium containing 10 mM zinc compared with control cells.
Transfected yeast cells also showed cobalt sensitivity, suggesting that
cobalt may be a ZNT5 substrate.

Using chicken B cells lacking Znt5, Znt6 (611148), and Znt7 (611149),
followed by reexpression of the human transgenes, Suzuki et al. (2005)
showed that ZNT5 and ZNT6 had to be coexpressed to transport zinc for
activation of tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP, or ALPL;
171760) in the Golgi lumen, whereas ZNT7 acted alone to perform the same
function. Coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence analyses showed
that ZNT5 and ZNT6 formed heterooligomers and that ZNT7 formed
homooligomers.

GENE STRUCTURE

Cragg et al. (2002) determined that the SLC30A5 gene contains 11 exons
and spans about 21 kb. The promoter region contains a putative TATA box
and a core consensus metal response element.

Seve et al. (2004) stated that the human SLC30A5 gene contains 15 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Cragg et al. (2002) mapped the SLC30A5
gene to chromosome 5. Seve et al. (2004) stated that the SLC30A5 gene
maps to chromosome 5q11.2.

ANIMAL MODEL

Inoue et al. (2002) reported that mice deficient for SLC30A5 showed poor
growth and decreased bone density, due to impairment of osteoblast
maturation. More than 60% of male null mice died suddenly because of
bradyarrhythmias. Analysis of gene expression profiles in murine hearts
by means of an oligonucleotide microarray disclosed that a subset of
genes encoding immediate-early response factors (IEGs) and heat shock
proteins (HSPs) were downregulated in Znt5-null mice. The authors
concluded that SLC30A5 plays an important role in maturation of
osteoblasts and in maintenance of the cells involved in the cardiac
conduction system, perhaps through regulating expression of IEGs and
HSPs.

608472	TITLE *608472 ST6 BETA-GALACTOSAMIDE ALPHA-2,6-SIALYLTRANSFERASE 2; ST6GAL2
;;ST6GALII;;
KIAA1877
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Sialyltransferases, such as ST6GAL2 (EC 2.4.99.1), are type II
transmembrane proteins that catalyze the transfer of sialic acid from
CMP-sialic acid to an acceptor carbohydrate, usually to the terminal
ends of carbohydrate chains.

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult hippocampus
cDNA library, Nagase et al. (2001) cloned ST6GalII, which they
designated KIAA1877. The deduced protein contains 534 amino acids, and
the 3-prime untranslated region contains an Alu repetitive element.
ST6GalII shares 55% identity over 413 amino acids with chicken
CMP-N-acetylneuraminate beta-galactosamide-alpha-2. RT-PCR ELISA
detected intermediate expression in all tissues and specific brain
regions examined except skeletal muscle, pancreas, and spleen, where
little to no expression was detected.

By searching ESTs for sequences similar to ST6GalI (109675), followed by
RT-PCR of a colon cDNA library, Takashima et al. (2002) cloned ST6GalII.
The deduced 529-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of
60.2 kD. ST6GalII contains an N-terminal hydrophobic sequence
characteristic of type 2 transmembrane proteins followed by a stem
region, and sialyl motifs L (long), S (short), and VS (very short). The
VS motif contains the his and glu residues conserved among mammalian
sialyltransferases. The protein also contains 4 potential
N-glycosylation sites. The authors noted that the protein predicted by
their clone lacks 5 N-terminal amino acids predicted by KIAA1877. They
also found evidence for alternative splicing in some ST6GalII-related
clones. ST6GalII shares significant identity in sialyl motifs L and S
with other sialyltransferases, with highest sequence identity (48.9%)
shared with ST6GalI. Expression was below the level of detection by
Northern blot analysis; however, RT-PCR detected expression in small
intestine, colon, and fetal brain. Expression was very low in other
tissues.

By searching ESTs for sequences similar to ST6GalI, followed by RT-PCR
of neuroblastoma cell line tRNA, Krzewinski-Recchi et al. (2003) cloned
ST6GalII. Northern blot analysis detected an 8.0-kb transcript only in
brain. RNA dot blot analysis detected expression in lymph node, and to a
lesser extent in testis, thyroid gland, caudate nucleus, temporal lobe,
hippocampus, and fetal brain, kidney, thymus, and liver. Little to no
expression was detected in other tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Takashima et al. (2002) engineered recombinant ST6GalII that lacked the
transmembrane domain and was fused to protein A to ease purification.
This fusion protein, expressed by transfected COS-7 cells as a secreted
protein, exhibited alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase activity toward
oligosaccharides that have the Gal-beta-1,4-GlcNAc sequence at the
nonreducing end of their carbohydrate groups. It showed little activity
toward glycoproteins believed to contain the same carbohydrate group,
and no activity toward comparable glycolipids. Takashima et al. (2002)
concluded that ST6Gal1II is specific for oligosaccharide substrates.
Analysis of the products indicated that ST6GalII transfers sialic acid
on to galactose of Gal-beta-1,4-GlcNAc structure through an
alpha-2,6-linkage.

Krzewinski-Recchi et al. (2003) assayed ST6GalII lacking the first 33
N-terminal amino acids that was expressed in COS-7 cells as a soluble
secreted protein. They determined that the best acceptor substrates for
ST6GalII were the free disaccharide Gal-beta-1,4-GlcNAc and free
oligosaccharides lacto-N neotetraose and
Gal-beta-1,4-GlcNAc-beta-O-octyl.

GENE STRUCTURE

Takashima et al. (2002) determined that the ST6GalII gene contains at
least 8 exons and spans over 85 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis Nagase et al. (2001) mapped the ST6GalII
gene to chromosome 2. By genomic sequence analysis Takashima et al.
(2002) mapped the ST6GalII gene to chromosome 2q11.2-q12.1.

;;RAS-ASSOCIATING GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE EXCHANGE FACTOR 2; RAGEF2;;
PDZ DOMAIN-CONTAINING GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE EXCHANGE FACTOR 2; PDZGEF2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for sequences similar to RAGEF1 (RAPGEF2; 609530), followed
by screening a fetal brain cDNA library and 5-prime and 3-prime RACE,
Gao et al. (2001) cloned RAPGEF6, which they called RAGEF2. The deduced
1,509-amino acid protein contains several of the domains present in
RAPGEF2, including cNMP-binding, REM, PDZ, and RA domains as well as the
GEF catalytic domain. Northern blot analysis detected a RAPGEF6
transcript of about 8 kb which was abundantly expressed in heart, brain,
placenta, lung, and liver, but barely detectable in skeletal muscle,
kidney, and pancreas.

Kuiperij et al. (2003) cloned 2 splice variants of RAPGEF6, which they
called PDZGEF2A and PDZGEF2B, from human umbilical cord and Jurkat
T-cell cDNA libraries. The deduced proteins contain 1,601 and 1,391
amino acids, respectively, and they differ after amino acid 1,249. Like
RAPGEF2, PDZGEF2A contains a C-terminal proline-rich and a PDZ-binding
motif, whereas PDZGEF2B lacks these motifs. Unlike RAPGEF2, both PDZGEF2
isoforms contain a second, less conserved, N-terminal RCBD (related
cyclic nucleotide-binding domain) domain. Northern blot analysis
detected ubiquitous expression of an approximately 9.0-kb RAPGEF6
transcript.

GENE FUNCTION

Gao et al. (2001) found that human RAPGEF6 expressed in insect cells
showed GEF activity toward RAP1A (179520) and RAP2A (179540), but not
toward other RAS family members. RAPGEF6 colocalized with activated MRAS
(608435) in the plasma membrane of cotransfected COS-7 cells, leading to
an increase in the GTP-bound form of plasma membrane RAP1. Gao et al.
(2001) concluded that RAPGEF6 acts as the GEF for RAP1 and RAP2
downstream of MRAS in the plasma membrane. Kuiperij et al. (2003)
demonstrated that RAPGEF2 activated both RAP1 and RAP2.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Gao et al. (2001) and Kuiperij et al.
(2003) mapped the RAPGEF6 gene to chromosome 5.

MOUSE MAMMARY TUMOR VIRUS INTEGRATION SITE 3, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Notch proteins are single-pass transmembrane receptors that regulate
cell fate decisions during development. The Notch family includes 4
receptors, NOTCH1 (190198), NOTCH2 (600275), NOTCH3 (600276), and
NOTCH4, whose ligands include JAG1 (601920), JAG2 (602570), DLL1
(606582), DLL3 (602768), and DLL4 (605185). All of the receptors have an
extracellular domain containing multiple epidermal growth factor (EGF;
131530)-like repeats and an intracellular region containing the RAM
domain, ankyrin repeats, and a C-terminal PEST domain (Das et al.,
2004).

CLONING

Uyttendaele et al. (1996) cloned cDNAs corresponding to the complete
coding region of the mouse Int3 gene. They proposed renaming this gene
Notch4, and reserving Int3 for the truncated oncogene that contains only
the transmembrane and intracellular domains of Notch4. In situ
hybridization revealed that Notch4 transcripts are primarily restricted
to endothelial cells in embryonic and adult life, suggesting a specific
role for Notch4 during development of vertebrate endothelium.

Li et al. (1998) isolated cDNAs corresponding to 6.7-kb NOTCH4(S) and
9.3-kb NOTCH4(L) mRNA isoforms. The predicted protein encoded by
NOTCH4(S) is 2,003 amino acids long and contains the characteristic
Notch motifs: a signal peptide, 29 epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like
repeats, 3 Notch/lin-12 repeats, a transmembrane region, 6 cdc10
(603151)/ankyrin (see 600465) repeats, and the PEST conserved region at
the C terminus. The sequences of the mouse and human NOTCH4 proteins are
82% identical. The incompletely spliced NOTCH4(L) cDNA potentially
encodes 2 different proteins. One consists of the first 7 EGF repeats.
The second contains the transmembrane domain and intracellular region
and is similar to the mouse int3 protooncoprotein. Northern blot
analysis revealed that NOTCH4(S) is the major transcript and is
expressed in a wide variety of tissues.

GENE STRUCTURE

Li et al. (1998) reported that the NOTCH4 gene contains 30 exons and
spans approximately 30 kb.

MAPPING

Sugaya et al. (1994) identified the NOTCH4 gene while conducting a
chromosome walk in the class III region of the major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) near the junction with class II. Fluorescence in situ
hybridization confirmed the location of the NOTCH4 gene at chromosome
6p21.3.

Sugaya et al. (1997) noted that 10 genes mapped on 6p21.3, including
NOTCH4, had counterparts structurally and functionally similar to those
mapped on 9q33-q34, indicating segmental chromosome duplication during
the course of evolution.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In linkage disequilibrium mapping of the MHC region in 80 British
parent-offspring trios, Wei and Hemmings (2000) found that NOTCH4 was
highly associated with schizophrenia (181500). The A-to-G substitution
in the promoter region and the (CTG)n repeat in exon 1 of NOTCH4 were
considered possible candidate sites conferring susceptibility to
schizophrenia.

Using all markers of NOTCH4 previously shown to be associated with
schizophrenia, Sklar et al. (2001) found no evidence for an association
in 3 independent family-based samples totaling 519 parent-offspring
trios, and in a case-control sample derived from the same ethnic
background as the original observation. Similarly, McGinnis et al.
(2001) failed to replicate the reported association in a large sample of
unrelated Scottish schizophrenics and controls, finding instead that
each putative schizophrenia-associated allele in the study of Wei and
Hemmings (2000) had a somewhat lower frequency in schizophrenics than in
controls.

ANIMAL MODEL

The Notch gene family encodes large transmembrane receptors that are
components of an evolutionarily conserved intercellular signaling
mechanism. To assess the role of the NOTCH4 gene, Krebs et al. (2000)
generated Notch4-deficient mice by gene targeting. Embryos homozygous
for this mutation developed normally, and homozygous mutant adults were
viable and fertile. However, the Notch4 mutation displayed genetic
interactions with a targeted mutation of the related Notch1 gene.
Embryos homozygous for mutations of both the Notch4 and Notch1 genes
often displayed a more severe phenotype than Notch1 homozygous mutant
embryos. Both Notch1 mutant and Notch1/Notch4 double mutant embryos
displayed severe defects in angiogenic vascular remodeling. Analysis of
the expression patterns of genes encoding ligands for Notch family
receptors indicated that only the Dll4 (DLL4; 605185) gene is expressed
in a pattern consistent with that expected for a gene encoding a ligand
for the Notch1 and Notch4 receptors in the early embryonic vasculature.
Krebs et al. (2000) stated that these results reveal an essential role
for the Notch signaling pathway in regulating embryonic vascular
morphogenesis and remodeling, and indicate that whereas the Notch4 gene
is not essential during embryonic development, the Notch4 and Notch1
genes have partially overlapping roles during embryogenesis in mice.

Murphy et al. (2008) generated mice with constitutively active Notch4
expression in endothelial cells from birth by using a
tetracycline-regulatable system. By 3 weeks of age, all mutants
developed hallmarks of brain arteriovenous malformations (BAVM; 108010),
including cerebral arteriovenous shunting and vessel enlargement,
followed by death by 5 weeks of age. Approximately 25% of the mutant
mice showed signs of neurologic dysfunction, including ataxia and
seizures. Imaging studies detected cerebral arteriovenous malformations.
Repression of Notch4 resolved ataxia and reversed the disease
progression, demonstrating that Notch4 is not only sufficient to induce
but also required to sustain the disease. Postmortem examination showed
hemorrhage and neuronal cell death within the cerebral cortex and
cerebellum, as well as widespread enlargement of the cerebral
microvasculature, which coincided with a reduction in capillary density.
These findings suggested that vessel enlargement underlies the
development of BAVM and linked this pathology to the known function of
NOTCH pathway as an inhibitor of vessel sprouting.

612488	TITLE *612488 RING FINGER PROTEIN 38; RNF38
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using an exon-trapping system, followed by screening a human placenta
cDNA library and 5-prime RACE, Eisenberg et al. (2002) cloned RNF38. The
deduced 432-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 48.5
kD and shares high similarity with the putative rat, mouse, Drosophila,
and Arabidopsis homologs. RNF38 contains a predicted coiled-coil domain,
a KIL motif, and a RING-H2 domain. Northern blot analysis detected a
6.8-kb transcript in all tissues examined with higher expression in
testis and lower expression detected in liver. EST database analysis
confirmed widespread expression of RNF38 in numerous tissues.

GENE STRUCTURE

Eisenberg et al. (2002) determined that the RNF38 gene contains at least
13 exons spanning over 65 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Eisenberg et al. (2002) mapped the RNF38
gene to chromosome 9p13-p12, approximately 78 kb centromeric to the GNE
gene (603824).

;;RIBOSOMAL PHOSPHOPROTEIN, ACIDIC, P2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Acidic ribosomal proteins, called A-proteins or P-proteins, are
generally present in multiple copies on the ribosome and have
isoelectric points in the range of pH 3 to 5, in contrast to most
ribosomal proteins, which are single copy and basic. A-proteins have
hydrophobic amino acid compositions, notably about 20% alanine.

CLONING

Rich and Steitz (1987) described the isolation and analysis of 3 cDNA
molecules that encode the human P-proteins, P2, P1 (180520), and P0
(180510). The human P1 and P2 cDNA nucleotide sequences and deduced
amino acid sequences of the proteins are very similar to the sequences
that have been determined for the corresponding rat, shrimp, and yeast
proteins and cDNAs. P0 sequences had not previously been described. To
demonstrate that the coding sequences are full length, Rich and Steitz
(1987) transcribed the P0, P1, and P2 cDNAs in vitro. The P0, P1, and P2
proteins produced were serologically and electrophoretically identical
to P-proteins extracted from HeLa cells. The deduced P2 protein contains
115 amino acids. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a 0.60-kb
transcript in HeLa cells.

;;MADH2;;
SMA- AND MAD-RELATED PROTEIN 2 MAD, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF;;
MADR2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Riggins et al. (1996) identified a homolog of the Drosophila 'mothers
against decapentaplegic' (Mad) gene (also 'mothers against dpp'). The
predicted 467-amino acid polypeptide, referred to by them as JV18-1,
shows maximal homology to Mad genes at the amino and carboxy termini of
the protein, with 62% identity to Mad over 373 amino acids. Drosophila
Mad apparently acts downstream of the TGF-beta receptor (190181) to
transduce signals from the members of the TGF-beta gene family (190180).
The gene product shows 44% identity over 158 amino acids to another Mad
homolog, DPC4 (SMAD4; 600993).

Graff et al. (1996) described a family of Xenopus proteins homologous to
the Drosophila Mad and C. elegans CEM genes. MAD and MAD-related
proteins are important components of the serine/threonine kinase
receptor signal transduction pathways. Eppert et al. (1996) cloned and
characterized a member of this family, which they designated MADR2. The
gene encodes a 467-amino acid protein that contains no common structural
motifs known at that time. MADR2 shares high homology with MADR1
(601595) and significant homology with DPC4. They reported that MADR2 is
rapidly phosphorylated by activation of the TGF-beta signaling pathway.

By RT-PCR of human erythroleukemia cell mRNA using primers based on
conserved regions between the Drosophila Mad and C. elegans Sma genes,
Nakao et al. (1997) cloned a SMAD2 cDNA. Northern blot analysis of human
tissues detected ubiquitously expressed 3.4- and 2.9-kb SMAD2
transcripts. The encoded protein has a molecular mass of 58 kD by
SDS-PAGE.

Baker and Harland (1996) identified the mouse Madr2 gene using a
functional assay to clone mouse mesoderm inducers from Xenopus ectoderm.
The mouse amino acid sequence is 46% identical to the human tumor
suppressor DPC4. Madr2 was expressed widely in the mouse embryo (with
the exception of heart and the tail bud) from embryonic days 6.5 to
10.5. Madr2 was found to be confined to the nucleus in the deep anterior
cells of the second axis, whereas it was localized in the cytoplasm in
the epidermal and more posterior cells. Because Madr2 localized to the
nucleus in response to activin (see 147290) and because activin-like
phenotypes were induced by overexpression of Madr2, Baker and Harland
(1996) concluded that Madr2 is a signal transduction component that
mediates the activity of activin.

GENE FUNCTION

Macias-Silva et al. (1996) demonstrated that MADR2 and not the related
protein DPC4 transiently interacts with the TGF-beta receptor and is
directly phosphorylated by the complex on C-terminal serines.
Interaction of MADR2 with receptors and phosphorylation requires
activation of receptor I by receptor II and is mediated by the receptor
I kinase. Mutation of the phosphorylation sites generated a
dominant-negative MADR2 that blocks TGF-beta-dependent transcriptional
responses, stably associates with receptors, and fails to accumulate in
the nucleus in response to TGF-beta signaling. Thus, Macias-Silva et al.
(1996) concluded that transient association and phosphorylation of MADR2
by the TGF-beta receptor is necessary for nuclear accumulation and
initiation of signaling.

SMAD proteins mediate TGF-beta signaling to regulate cell growth and
differentiation. Stroschein et al. (1999) identified SnoN (165340) as a
component of the SMAD pathway. They proposed a model of regulation of
TGF-beta signaling by SnoN in which SnoN maintains the repressed state
of TGF-beta target genes in the absence of ligand and participates in
the negative feedback regulation of TGF-beta signaling. In the absence
of TGF-beta, SnoN binds to the nuclear SMAD4 (DPC4) and represses
TGF-beta-responsive promoter activity through recruitment of a nuclear
repressor complex. TGF-beta induces activation and nuclear translocation
of SMAD2, SMAD3 (603109), and SMAD4. SMAD3 causes degradation of SnoN,
allowing a SMAD2/SMAD4 complex to activate TGF-beta target genes. To
initiate a negative feedback mechanism that permits a precise and timely
regulation of TGF-beta signaling, TGF-beta also induces an increased
expression of SnoN at a later stage, which in turn binds to SMAD
heteromeric complexes and shuts off TGF-beta signaling.

SMADs mediate activin, TGF-beta, and BMP signaling from receptors to
nuclei. According to the current model, activated activin/TGF-beta
receptors phosphorylate the carboxyl-terminal serines of SMAD2 and SMAD3
(SSMS-COOH); phosphorylated SMAD2/SMAD3 oligomerizes with SMAD4,
translocates to the nucleus, and modulates transcription of defined
genes. To test key features of this model, Funaba and Mathews (2000)
explored the construction of constitutively active SMAD2 mutants. To
mimic phosphorylated SMAD2, they made 2 SMAD2 mutants with acidic amino
acid substitutions of carboxyl-terminal serines: SMAD2-2E and SMAD2-3E.
The mutants enhanced basal transcriptional activity in a mink lung
epithelial cell line, L17. In a SMAD4-deficient cell line, SMAD2-2E did
not affect basal signaling; suggesting that the constitutively active
SMAD2 mutant also requires SMAD4 for function. Funaba and Mathews (2000)
concluded that SMAD2 phosphorylation results in both tighter binding to
SMAD4 and increased nuclear concentration; those changes may be
responsible for transcriptional activation by SMAD2.

You and Kruse (2002) studied corneal myofibroblast differentiation and
signal transduction induced by the TGFB family members activin A
(147290) and bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP7; 112267). They found
that activin A induced phosphorylation of SMAD2, and BMP7 induced SMAD1
(601595), both of which were inhibited by follistatin (136470).
Transfection with antisense SMAD2/SMAD3 prevented activin-induced
expression and accumulation of alpha-smooth muscle actin. The authors
concluded that TGFB proteins have different functions in the cornea.
Activin A and TGFB1, but not BMP7, are regulators of keratocyte
differentiation and might play a role during myofibroblast
transdifferentiation. SMAD2/SMAD3 signal transduction appeared to be
important in the regulation of muscle-specific genes.

Oft et al. (2002) found that activation of Smad2 induced migration of
mouse squamous carcinoma cells, but that elevated levels of H-ras
(190020) were required for nuclear accumulation of Smad2. Elevated
levels of both were required for induction of spindle-cell
transformation and metastasis.

SMAD2 is released from cytoplasmic retention by TGFB receptor-mediated
phosphorylation and accumulates in the nucleus, where it associates with
cofactors to regulate transcription. Xu et al. (2002) uncovered direct
interactions of SMAD2 with the nucleoporins NUP214 (114350) and NUP153
(603948). These interactions mediate constitutive nucleocytoplasmic
shuttling of SMAD2. NUP214 and NUP153 compete with the cytoplasmic
retention factor SARA (603755) and the nuclear SMAD2 partner FAST1
(603621) for binding to a hydrophobic corridor on the MH2 surface of
SMAD2. TGFB receptor-mediated phosphorylation stimulates nuclear
accumulation of SMAD2 by modifying its affinity for SARA and SMAD4 but
not for NUP214 or NUP153. Thus, by directly contacting the nuclear pore
complex, SMAD2 undergoes constant shuttling, providing a dynamic pool
that is competitively drawn by cytoplasmic and nuclear signal
transduction partners.

TGFB stimulation leads to phosphorylation and activation of SMAD2 and
SMAD3, which form complexes with SMAD4 that accumulate in the nucleus
and regulate transcription of target genes. Inman et al. (2002)
demonstrated that following TGFB stimulation of epithelial cells,
receptors remain active for at least 3 to 4 hours, and continuous
receptor activity is required to maintain active SMADs in the nucleus
and for TGFB-induced transcription. Continuous nucleocytoplasmic
shuttling of the SMADs during active TGFB signaling provides the
mechanism whereby the intracellular transducers of the signal
continuously monitor receptor activity. These data explain how, at all
times, the concentration of active SMADs in the nucleus is directly
dictated by the levels of activated receptors in the cytoplasm.

Using Xenopus embryo explants, whole zebrafish embryos, and mammalian
cell lines, Batut et al. (2007) showed that phosphorylation and nuclear
accumulation of Smad2 required an intact microtubule network and the
ATPase activity of the kinesin motor. Smad2 interacted directly with the
kinesin-1 light chain subunit (KLC2), and interfering with kinesin
activity in Xenopus and zebrafish embryos phenocopied loss of Nodal
(601265) signaling.

Davis et al. (2008) demonstrated that induction of a contractile
phenotype in human vascular smooth muscle cells by TGF-beta (190180) and
BMPs is mediated by miR21 (611020). miR21 downregulates PDCD4 (608610),
which in turn acts as a negative regulator of smooth muscle contractile
genes. Surprisingly, TGF-beta and BMP signaling promoted a rapid
increase in expression of mature miR21 through a posttranscriptional
step, promoting the processing of primary transcripts of miR21
(pri-miR21) into precursor miR21 (pre-miR21) by the Drosha complex (see
608828). TGF-beta and BMP-specific SMAD signal transducers SMAD1, SMAD2,
SMAD3 (603109), and SMAD5 (603110) are recruited to pri-miR21 in a
complex with the RNA helicase p68 (DDX5; 180630), a component of the
Drosha microprocessor complex. The shared cofactor SMAD4 (600993) is not
required for this process. Thus, Davis et al. (2008) concluded that
regulation of microRNA biogenesis by ligand-specific SMAD proteins is
critical for control of the vascular smooth muscle cell phenotype and
potentially for SMAD4-independent responses mediated by the TGF-beta and
BMP signaling pathways.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Wu et al. (2000) determined the crystal structure of a SMAD2 MH2 domain
in complex with the SMAD-binding domain of SARA at 2.2-angstrom
resolution.

Wu et al. (2001) determined the crystal structure of a phosphorylated
SMAD2 at 1.8-angstrom resolution. The structure revealed the formation
of a homotrimer mediated by the C-terminal phosphoserine residues. The
phosphoserine-binding surface on the MH2 domain, which is frequently
targeted for inactivation in cancers, is highly conserved among the
comediator SMADs (Co-SMADs) and receptor-regulated SMADs (R-SMADs). This
finding, together with mutagenesis data, pinpointed a functional
interface between SMAD2 and SMAD4. In addition, the
phosphoserine-binding surface on the MH2 domain coincides with the
surface on R-SMADs that is required for docking interactions with the
serine-phosphorylated receptor kinases. These observations defined a
bifunctional role for the MH2 domain as a
phosphoserine-X-phosphoserine-binding module in receptor ser/thr kinase
signaling pathways.

GENE STRUCTURE

Takenoshita et al. (1998) determined the structure of the human MADH2
gene and characterized the 5-prime and 3-prime ends of MADH2 mRNAs. The
MADH2 gene contains 12 exons, the first 2 (1a and 1b) of which are
alternatively spliced such that they are used singly or in combination.
In addition, RT-PCR showed that the fourth exon (exon 3), which encodes
30 amino acids, is spliced out in about 10% of MADH2 transcripts. The
authors found that MADH2 mRNAs are transcribed from 2 different
promoters located in 1 CpG island. The 3-prime ends of MADH2 mRNAs are
heterogeneous, and Takenoshita et al. (1998) identified several
polyadenylation signals.

MAPPING

Eppert et al. (1996) mapped the MADR2 gene close to DPC4 at 18q21, a
region which is frequently deleted in colorectal cancers. Riggins et al.
(1996) mapped the human MADH2 gene to 18q21. Nakao et al. (1997) refined
the localization of the SMAD2 gene to 18q21.1, approximately 3 Mb
proximal to DPC4, by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Somatic Mutation in Colorectal Cancer

In a screen of 66 sporadic colorectal carcinomas, Eppert et al. (1996)
identified 4 missense mutations in MADR2, 2 of which were associated
with loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in 1 allele. These mutations were
associated with loss of protein expression or loss of TGF-beta-regulated
phosphorylation. Eppert et al. (1996) proposed that MADR2 is a tumor
suppressor gene and that mutations acquired in colorectal cancer may
function to disrupt TGF-beta signaling.

Riggins et al. (1996) evaluated JV18-1 in a panel of 18 colorectal
cancer cell lines, each containing allelic loss of the minimally lost
region on chromosome 18q. RT-PCR studies revealed JV18-1 expression in
normal colon, normal brain, and in 17 of 18 colorectal tumors. They
identified 1 tumor in which there was a homozygous deletion of JV18-1
sequences. The deletion in this tumor did not extend proximally to
include D18S535 or distally to DPC4. In another tumor, a smaller protein
encoded by JV18-1 was present. The protein was shorter because of a
deletion extending from codons 345 to 358. This deletion was somatic in
origin. Riggins et al. (1996) concluded that this gene family may be
important in the suppression of neoplasia, since its members transduce
growth inhibitory signals from TGF-beta.

By PCR-SSCP analysis of the entire coding region of the SMAD2 gene using
intron-based primers, Takenoshita et al. (1998) screened genomic DNA
sequences of colorectal cancers for mutations of the SMAD2 gene.
Although no mutations were found within any exon of SMAD2, 2 of 60
sporadic colorectal cancers displayed deletions in the polypyrimidine
tract preceding exon 4. Deletions of this region were also detected in
colon cancer cell lines, and were clustered within cells exhibiting
microsatellite instability. Deletions in the polypyrimidine tract had no
effect on the splicing of the SMAD2 gene in these cases; however, the
polypyrimidine tract in the splicing acceptor site may be a target for
mutations in mismatch repair-deficient tumors.

Takagi et al. (1998) carried out mutation analyses of the SMAD2 gene on
cDNA sampled from 36 primary colorectal cancer specimens. Only 1
missense mutation (2.8%), producing an amino acid substitution in the
highly conserved region, and 2 homozygous deletions (5.5%) of the total
coding region of SMAD2 gene were detected. They concluded that the SMAD2
gene may play a role as a candidate tumor suppressor gene in a small
fraction of colorectal cancers. Even in combination with changes in
SMAD4, the observed frequency was not sufficient to account for all
18q21 deletions in colorectal cancers. Thus, another tumor suppressor
gene, such as DCC (120470), discovered as the first tumor suppressor
candidate in the region, may exist in the 18q21 region where LOH is
often seen.

Using cDNA, Roth et al. (2000) conducted mutation analysis of the SMAD2,
SMAD3, and SMAD4 genes in 14 Finnish kindreds with hereditary
nonpolyposis colon cancer (see 120435). They found no mutations.

ANIMAL MODEL

Waldrip et al. (1998) studied the effect of Smad2 in mouse embryonic
development by targeted disruption of the mouse Smad2 gene using
embryonic stem cell technology. They found that Smad2 function was not
required for mesoderm production per se, but, rather unexpectedly, in
the absence of Smad2, the entire epiblast adopts a mesodermal fate
giving rise to a normal yolk sac and fetal blood cells. In contrast,
Smad2 mutant mouse embryos entirely lacked tissues of the embryonic germ
layers. Waldrip et al. (1998) concluded that Smad2 signals serve to
restrict the site of primitive streak formation and establish
anterior-posterior identity within the epiblast. Chimera experiments
demonstrated that these essential activities are contributed by the
extraembryonic tissues. Thus, the extraembryonic tissues play critical
roles in establishing the body plan during early mouse development.

NOMENCLATURE

Derynck et al. (1996) proposed a revised nomenclature for the
Mad-related products and genes that are implicated in signal
transduction by members of the TGF-beta family. As the root symbol they
proposed SMAD, which is a merger of Sma (the gene in C. elegans) and
Mad. SMAD serves to differentiate these proteins from unrelated gene
products previously called MAD (see 600021). JV18.1 became SMAD2 in
their nomenclature.

611990	TITLE *611990 MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN S28; MRPS28
;;MRPS35
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mitochondria have their own translation system for production of 13
proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation. MRPS28 is 1 of more
than 70 protein components of mitochondrial ribosomes that are encoded
by the nuclear genome (Kenmochi et al., 2001).

CLONING

By proteolytic digestion of whole bovine 28S subunits, followed by
peptide analysis and EST database analysis, O'Brien et al. (2000) and
Koc et al. (2001) independently identified full-length human MRPS28.
O'Brien et al. (2000) determined that the MRPS28 protein contains 188
amino acids. Koc et al. (2001) determined that the MRPS28 protein, which
they designated MRPS35, contains 187 amino acids and has a calculated
molecular mass of 20.8 kD. Removal of a predicted 28-amino acid
N-terminal mitochondrial localization signal results in a mature 17.6-kD
protein. O'Brien et al. (2000) and Koc et al. (2001) identified MRPS28
orthologs in mouse, rat, Drosophila, and C. elegans, but not in yeast or
E. coli. Koc et al. (2001) reported that mouse and human MRPS28 share
72.5% amino acid identity.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis and analysis of an integrated BAC-STS map,
Kenmochi et al. (2001) mapped the MRPS28 gene to chromosome
8q21.1-q21.2.

607990	TITLE *607990 UBIQUITIN-LIKE PROTEIN CONTAINING PHD AND RING FINGER DOMAINS 1; UHRF1
;;INVERTED CCAAT BOX-BINDING PROTEIN, 90-KD; ICBP90;;
NUCLEAR PHOSPHOPROTEIN, 95-KD; NP95
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

UHRF1 binds to an inverted CCAAT box in the promoter of topoisomerase
II-alpha (TOP2A; 126430). TOP2A introduces transient double-stranded
breaks in DNA, which are required during the cell cycle for DNA
replication, chromosome condensation, and segregation. UHRF1 is likely
involved in TOPO2A expression (Hopfner et al., 2000).

CLONING

By yeast 1-hybrid analysis of a Jurkat leukemia cell line cDNA library
using the second inverted CCAAT box (ICB2) of the TOP2A promoter as
bait, followed by screening an adult thymus cDNA library, Hopfner et al.
(2000) cloned UHRF1, which they called ICBP90. The deduced 793-amino
acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of about 90 kD. ICBP90
contains an N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain partially overlapped by a
leucine zipper domain, followed by a central zinc finger of the PHD
finger type and a C-terminal zinc finger of the ring finger type. It
also has 2 nuclear localization signals, phosphorylation sites for
several kinases, and a consensus Rb1 (614041)-binding sequence. RNA dot
blot analysis detected expression of ICBP90 at highest levels in adult
and fetal thymus, followed by fetal liver, adult bone marrow, testis,
lung, heart, and fetal kidney. Highly differentiated tissues, such as
central nervous system and peripheral blood leukocytes, showed no
detectable expression. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed nuclear
expression of both endogenous HeLa cell ICBP90 and ICBP90 ectopically
expressed in COS-1 cells. Western blot analysis detected ICBP90 at an
apparent molecular mass of 97 kD in confluent HeLa cells; a minor 50-kD
band was also detected. Other bands were observed in proliferating HeLa
cells. Histochemical analysis of appendix showed expression restricted
to areas of cell proliferation (germinal centers and glandular crypts),
where ICBP90 colocalized with TOP2A. Expression of both proteins was
elevated in high-grade breast carcinomas and slightly elevated in
low-grade breast carcinomas.

By Northern blot analysis, Hopfner et al. (2001) detected transcripts of
5.1 and 4.3 kb in several cancer cell lines. The relative amount of each
transcript depended upon the tissue of origin.

GENE FUNCTION

Hopfner et al. (2000) determined that ICBP90 bound the ICB2 of TOP2A in
vivo and in vitro, and that expression of ICBP90 was concomitant with
expression of TOP2A in human lung fibroblasts and several cell lines.
Transfection of ICBP90 into COS-1 cells resulted in enhanced expression
of both ICBP90 and TOP2A.

Bonapace et al. (2002) determined that mouse Np95 is an early target of
the oncogenic DNA virus, adenovirus E1A, during induced proliferation.
E1A induced Np95 expression in terminally differentiated mouse myotubes.
The concomitant expression of Np95 and of cyclin E (123837)-Cdk2
(116953) was sufficient to induce S phase in these cells. In mouse
fibroblasts, expression of Np95 was tightly regulated during the cell
cycle, and its functional ablation abrogated DNA synthesis. Bonapace et
al. (2002) concluded that Np95 is essential for S phase entry.

Bostick et al. (2007) showed that the protein UHRF1, also known as NP95
in mouse and ICBP90 in human, is required for maintaining DNA
methylation. UHRF1 colocalizes with the maintenance DNA
methyltransferase protein DNMT1 (126375) throughout S phase. UHRF1
appears to tether DNMT1 to chromatin through its direct interaction with
DNMT1. Furthermore, UHRF1 contains a methyl DNA binding domain, the SRA
(SET- and RING-associated) domain, that shows strong preferential
binding to hemimethylated CG sites, the physiologic substrate for DNMT1.
Bostick et al. (2007) concluded that UHRF1 may help recruit DNMT1 to
hemimethylated DNA to facilitate faithful maintenance of DNA
methylation.

Sharif et al. (2007) demonstrated that localization of mouse Np95 to
replicating heterochromatin is dependent on the presence of
hemimethylated DNA. Np95 forms complexes with Dnmt1 and mediates the
loading of Dnmt1 to replicating heterochromatic regions. By using
Np95-deficient embryonic stem cells and embryos, Sharif et al. (2007)
showed that Np95 is essential in vivo to maintain global and local DNA
methylation and to repress transcription of retrotransposons and
imprinted genes. Sharif et al. (2007) concluded that the link between
hemimethylated DNA, Np95, and Dnmt1 thus establishes key steps of the
mechanism for epigenetic inheritance of DNA methylation.

Sen et al. (2010) showed that DNMT1 (126375) is essential for epidermal
progenitor cell function. DNMT1 protein was found enriched in
undifferentiated cells, where it was required to retain proliferative
stamina and suppress differentiation. In tissue, DNMT1 depletion led to
exit from the progenitor cell compartment, premature differentiation,
and eventual tissue loss. Genomewide analysis showed that a significant
portion of epidermal differentiation gene promoters were methylated in
self-renewing conditions but were subsequently demethylated during
differentiation. Furthermore, UHRF1, a component of the DNA methylation
machinery that targets DNMT1 to hemimethylated DNA, is also necessary to
suppress premature differentiation and sustain proliferation. In
contrast, Gadd45A (126335) and B (604948), which promote active DNA
demethylation, are required for full epidermal differentiation gene
induction. Sen et al. (2010) concluded that proteins involved in the
dynamic regulation of DNA methylation patterns are required for
progenitor maintenance and self-renewal in mammalian somatic tissue.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Avvakumov et al. (2008) reported the 1.7-angstrom crystal structure of
the SRA domain of human UHRF1 and the 2.2-angstrom structure of the SRA
domain in complex with a 12-bp double-stranded DNA with a central
hemimethylated CpG. In the SRA-DNA complex, the 5-methylcytosine was
flipped out of the duplex DNA and interacted with a binding pocket of
the SRA domain. Two loops in the SRA domain reached through the
resulting gap in the DNA from both the major and minor grooves to read
the other 3 bases of the CpG duplex. The major groove loop appeared to
confer both specificity for the CpG dinucleotide and discrimination
against methylation of deoxycytidine of the complementary strand.

Arita et al. (2008) and Hashimoto et al. (2008) determined the crystal
structure of the SRA domain of mouse Uhrf1 in complex with
hemimethylated CpG and presented findings similar to those of Avvakumov
et al. (2008).

GENE STRUCTURE

Hopfner et al. (2001) determined that the ICBP90 gene contains 8 exons
and spans about 35 kD. Exons 1 and 2 are noncoding. The promoter region
contains 3 Sp1 (189906)-binding sites.

MAPPING

By FISH, Hopfner et al. (2001) mapped the UHRF1 gene to chromosome
19p13.3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Muto et al. (2002) determined that inactivation of mouse Np95 was lethal
to midgestation embryos. Using Np95 null embryonic stem cells, they
found that lack of Np95 expression increased cell sensitivity to
inhibition of DNA replication and to DNA damaging agents, including
x-rays, ultraviolet light, and alkylation.

194549	TITLE *194549 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 76; ZNF76
;;D6S229E
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Ragoussis et al. (1992) identified a novel testis-expressed zinc finger
gene, ZNF76, by screening cDNA libraries with cosmids derived from 6p21.
ZNF76 is a member of the GLI-Kruppel family of DNA binding proteins. It
is conserved in mouse where transcription in testis is initiated at day
20 after birth. The mouse tcp-11 gene is located in the distal inversion
of the t-complex and is developmentally regulated in the same manner as
ZNF76. They are expressed in testis at exactly the same time. Ragoussis
et al. (1992) isolated the human homolog of tcp-11 (186982) by use of a
combination of somatic cell hybrids, radiation hybrids, metaphase and
interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization, and pulsed field gel
electrophoresis.

Staf is a Xenopus transcriptional activator that enhances transcription
of small nuclear RNA (snRNA) and snRNA-type genes by RNA polymerases II
(pol II) and III (pol III), and can also stimulate expression from a pol
II mRNA promoter. See ZNF143 (603433). Myslinski et al. (1998) found
that both ZNF76 and ZNF143 had homology to Staf. The predicted 515-amino
acid ZNF76 protein shares 64% and 63% identity with Staf and ZNF143,
respectively. Like Staf, both ZNF76 and ZNF143 contain 7 zinc fingers
and an activation domain with the mRNA and snRNA activation regions.
Both proteins bound Staf-responsive elements in vitro. When expressed in
Drosophila cells, both activated transcription from an mRNA promoter
through the Staf binding site. Chimeric ZNF76 and ZNF143 proteins
activated a pol II mRNA promoter, as well as pol II and pol III snRNA
promoters, in Xenopus oocytes. Northern blot analysis revealed that the
2.9-kb ZNF76 mRNA was expressed in all tissues tested, with the
strongest expression in testis. Myslinski et al. (1998) concluded that
ZNF76 is a novel DNA-binding protein related to Staf and ZNF143.

MAPPING

Ragoussis et al. (1992) mapped the human ZNF76 and TCP11 genes to the
chromosome 6p21.3-p21.2 region and linked them to each other within 300
kb of DNA, approximately 2 Mb centromeric to the major
histocompatibility complex. (The D number assigned to ZNF76 was
D6S229E.)

601763	TITLE *601763 CASPASE 8, APOPTOSIS-RELATED CYSTEINE PROTEASE; CASP8
;;MORT1-ASSOCIATED CED3 HOMOLOG; MACH;;
FADD-HOMOLOGOUS ICE/CED3-LIKE PROTEASE;;
FADD-LIKE ICE; FLICE;;
MCH5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

A cascade of protease reactions is believed to be responsible for the
apoptotic changes observed in mammalian cells undergoing programmed cell
death. This cascade involves members of the aspartate-specific cysteine
proteases of the ICE/CED3 (147678) family, also known as the caspase
family.

CLONING

Fernandes-Alnemri et al. (1996) identified the novel gene MCH5 when they
found a human EST sequence with significant homology to the newly
identified cysteine protease MCH4 (601762). They used PCR to clone a
cDNA of the MCH5 gene from a Jurkat T-cell cDNA library. Sequence
analysis revealed that it encodes a polypeptide of 496 amino acids with
greatest homology to MCH4. The authors found that MCH4 and MCH5 both
contain the active site pentapeptide QACQG instead of the QACRG present
in all other known members of the family. Furthermore, the authors found
that the sequences of MCH4 and MCH5 contain Fas-associating protein with
death domain (FADD)-like domains, suggesting possible interaction with
FADD. Fernandes-Alnemri et al. (1996) stated that MCH5, like other
members of the ICE/CED3 family, forms an active protease only after
cleavage of its proenzyme into 2 subunits which dimerize to form the
active enzyme.

Using MORT1 (FADD; 602457) in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a B-cell cDNA
library, Boldin et al. (1996) cloned several splice variants of CASP8,
which they called MACH. The isoforms could be divided into 2 main
subgroups. All isoforms share a common 182-amino acid N-terminal region,
including 2 MORT modules (i.e., death effector domains, or DEDs), but
they have different C termini. Subgroup alpha isoforms have C termini
containing a CED3/ICE homology domain that contains the catalytic site
and the substrate-binding pocket, while subgroup beta isoforms are
truncated and lack the CED3/ICE homology domain. The longest isoform,
MACH-alpha-1, encodes a deduced 479-amino acid protein. The CED3/ICE
domain of MACH-alpha-1 shares 41% and 34% identity with the homologous
regions in CPP32 (CASP3; 600636) and C. elegans CED3, respectively.
Northern blot analysis detected MACH transcripts ranging in size between
2.85 and 3.5 kb in all tissues examined, with highest levels in resting
peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes and lowest levels in testis and
skeletal muscle.

Eckhart et al. (2001) identified several CASP8 splice variants that
preferentially use a distant splice donor site at the 3-prime end of
exon 8. Use of this distant site, which they called exon 8b, results in
mRNAs with truncated open reading frames. RT-PCR indicated equal
expression of both mRNA species in tonsil, spleen, bone marrow, thymus,
and lymph nodes. Peripheral blood leukocytes, heart, and epidermis
predominantly expressed mRNA containing exon 8b, as did a promyelocytic
cell line and a T-cell line. Liver and nearly all immortalized cell
lines, as well as primary endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and
keratinocytes, expressed mRNA lacking the 8b extension.

GENE FUNCTION

Using fluorogenic peptide substrates corresponding to a sequence within
the nuclear protein PARP (173870), Boldin et al. (1996) confirmed that
MACH-alpha-1 is a thiol protease. By site-directed mutagenesis, they
identified cys360 as the catalytic cysteine. Using mutation analysis,
Boldin et al. (1996) determined that MACH binds to the N terminus of
MORT1. They also found that it self-associates, but it does not interact
directly with FAS/APO1 (TNRFSF6; 134637). Transfection of human
embryonic kidney cells and breast carcinoma cells with MACH-alpha-1 or
MACH-alpha-2 resulted in massive cell death.

Muzio et al. (1996) determined that CASP8, which they called FLICE,
interacts with wildtype FADD but not with FADD lacking the DED. They
also determined that granzyme B (GZMB; 123910) can remove the prodomain
and generate the active p20/p10 dimeric cysteine protease. Cleavage of
PARP by CASP8 resulted in the appearance of signature apoptotic
fragments. Transfection and overexpression of CASP8 in transfected
breast cancer cells resulted in apoptosis.

Expression of cDNAs that encode truncated polypeptides containing mostly
expanded polyglutamine repeats, but not of those that encode the
corresponding full-length proteins, has been shown to induce cell death
by apoptosis. Such truncated proteins have been shown to form aggregates
or inclusions (Ikeda et al., 1996). Sanchez et al. (1999) studied the
role of caspases in polyglutamine-induced cell death in established
cultures of primary cortical, striatal, and cerebellar neurons from
embryonic day 17 rat embryos, transfected with an expression construct
encoding truncated ataxin-3 that contained 79 glutamine (Q79) residues.
The authors showed that the apoptosis inhibitors Bcl2, CrmA, and a
truncated Fas/APO1-associated death domain protein (FADD DN) inhibited
polyglutamine repeat-induced neuronal cell death. A mutant Jurkat cell
line specifically lacking caspase-8 was resistant to
polyglutamine-induced cell death. Cells transfected with Q79 showed
insoluble inclusions. Caspase-8 was recruited and activated by these Q79
inclusions. Western blot analysis revealed the presence of activated
caspase-8 in the insoluble fraction of affected brain regions from
Huntington disease (143100) patients but not in those from controls. The
authors suggested that caspase-8 has an essential role in
Huntington-related neurodegenerative diseases.

Eckhart et al. (2001) found that different CASP8 isoforms were expressed
in resting and activated lymphocytes. Activation of lymphocytes shifted
the expression from mRNA species containing an exon 8b extension to
mRNAs that lack it. Differentiation in a promyelocytic cell line was
associated with the opposite shift, from mRNAs containing the shorter
exon 8 to mRNAs that include the exon 8b extension.

Gervais et al. (2002) found that HIP1 (601767) binds to the HIP1 protein
interactor (HIPPI; 606621), which has partial sequence homology to HIP1
and similar tissue and subcellular distribution. The availability of
free HIP1 is modulated by polyglutamine length within huntingtin
(613004), with disease-associated polyglutamine expansion favoring the
formation of proapoptotic HIPPI-HIP1 heterodimers. This heterodimer can
recruit procaspase-8 into a complex of HIPPI, HIP1, and procaspase-8,
and launch apoptosis through components of the extrinsic cell death
pathway. Gervais et al. (2002) proposed that huntingtin polyglutamine
expansion liberates HIP1 so that it can form a caspase-8 recruitment
complex with HIPPI, possibly contributing to neuronal death in
Huntington disease.

Yu et al. (2004) defined a novel molecular pathway in which activation
of the receptor-interacting protein (RIP; 603453), a serine-threonine
kinase, and Jun amino-terminal kinase (601158) induced cell death with
the morphology of autophagy. Autophagic death required the genes ATG7
(GSA7; 608760) and beclin-1 (604378) and was induced by caspase-8
inhibition. Yu et al. (2004) cautioned that clinical therapies involving
caspase inhibitors may arrest apoptosis but also have the unanticipated
effect of promoting autophagic cell death.

Poulaki et al. (2005) found that human retinoblastoma (RB1; 614041) cell
lines were resistant to death receptor (see DR5; 603612)-mediated
apoptosis because of a deficiency of CASP8 expression secondary to
epigenetic gene silencing by overmethylation. Treatment with a
demethylating agent restored CASP8 expression and sensitivity to
apoptosis.

Su et al. (2005) showed that caspase-8 deficiency (607271) in humans and
mice specifically abolishes activation of the transcription factor NF
kappa-B (164011) after stimulation through antigen receptors, Fc
receptors, or Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4; 603030) in T, B, and natural
killer cells. Caspase-8 also causes the alpha-beta complex of the
inhibitor of NF-kappa-B kinase (IKK; 600644 and 300248, respectively) to
associate with the upstream BCL10 (603517)-MALT1 (604860) adaptor
complex. Recruitment of the IKK-alpha,beta complex, its activation, and
the nuclear translocation of NF-kappa-B require enzyme activity of
full-length caspase-8. Su et al. (2005) concluded that their findings
explained the paradoxical association of defective apoptosis and
combined immunodeficiency in human caspase-8 deficiency.

Stupack et al. (2006) showed that suppression of caspase-8 expression
occurs during the establishment of neuroblastoma (256700) metastases in
vivo, and that reconstitution of caspase-8 expression in deficient
neuroblastoma cells suppressed their metastases. Caspase-8 status was
not a predictor of primary tumor growth; rather, caspase-8 selectively
potentiated apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells invading the collagenous
stroma at the tumor margin. Apoptosis was initiated by unligated
integrins (see 605025) by means of a process known as integrin-mediated
death. Loss of caspase-8 or integrin rendered the cells refractory to
integrin-mediated death, allowed cellular survival in the stromal
microenvironment, and promoted metastases. Stupack et al. (2006)
concluded that these findings define caspase-8 as a metastasis
suppressor gene that, together with integrins, regulates the survival
and invasive capacity of neuroblastoma cells.

Oberst et al. (2011) showed that development of caspase-8-deficient mice
is completely rescued by ablation of receptor-interacting protein
kinase-3 (RIPK3; 605817). Adult animals lacking both caspase-8 and Ripk3
displayed a progressive lymphoaccumulative disease resembling that seen
with defects in Cd95 (FAS; 134637) or Cd95 ligand (FASL; 134638), and
resisted the lethal effects of Cd95 ligation in vivo. Oberst et al.
(2011) found that caspase-8 prevents RIPK3-dependent necrosis without
inducing apoptosis by functioning in a proteolytically active complex
with CFLAR (603599) and that this complex is required for the protective
function.

Kaiser et al. (2011) found that Ripk3 is responsible for the
midgestational death of Casp8-deficient embryos. Remarkably,
Casp8-null/Rip3-null-double mutant mice were viable and matured into
fertile adults with a full immune complement of myeloid and lymphoid
cell types. These mice seemed immunocompetent but developed
lymphadenopathy by 4 months of age marked by accumulation of abnormal T
cells in the periphery, a phenotype reminiscent of mice with Fas
deficiency. Thus, Kaiser et al. (2011) concluded that Casp8 contributes
to homeostatic control in the adult immune system; however, RIPK3 and
CASP8 are together completely dispensable for mammalian development.

Burguillos et al. (2011) showed that the orderly activation of caspase-8
and caspase-3/7 (600636/601761), known executioners of apoptotic cell
death, regulate microglia activation through a protein kinase C-delta
(PPKCD; 176977)-dependent pathway. Burguillos et al. (2011) found that
stimulation of microglia with various inflammogens activates caspase-8
and caspase-3/7 in microglia without triggering cell death in vitro and
in vivo. Knockdown or chemical inhibition of each of these caspases
hindered microglia activation and consequently reduced neurotoxicity.
The authors observed that these caspases are activated in microglia in
the ventral mesencephalon of Parkinson disease (168600) and the frontal
cortex of individuals with Alzheimer disease (104300). Burguillos et al.
(2011) concluded that caspase-8 and caspase-3/7 are involved in
regulating microglia activation, and suggested that inhibition of these
caspases could be neuroprotective by targeting the microglia rather than
the neurons themselves.

Gunther et al. (2011) demonstrated a critical role for caspase-8 in
regulating necroptosis of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and
terminal ileitis. Mice with a conditional deletion of caspase-8 in the
intestinal epithelium (Casp8-delta-IEC) spontaneously developed
inflammatory lesions in the terminal ileum were highly susceptible to
colitis. These mice lacked Paneth cells and showed reduced numbers of
goblet cells, indicating dysregulated antimicrobial immune cell
functions of the intestinal epithelium. Casp8-delta-IEC mice showed
increased cell death in the Paneth cell area of small intestinal crypts.
Epithelial cell death was induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFA;
191160), was associated with increased expression of
receptor-interacting protein-3 (RIP3; 605817) and could be inhibited on
blockade of necroptosis. Lastly, Gunther et al. (2011) identified high
levels of RIP3 in human Paneth cells and increased necroptosis in the
terminal ileum of patients with Crohn disease, suggesting a potential
role of necroptosis in the pathogenesis of this disease. Gunther et al.
(2011) concluded that their data demonstrated a critical function of
caspase-8 in regulating intestinal homeostasis and in protecting IECs
from TNFA-induced necroptotic cell death.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Varfolomeev et al. (1998) determined that
the CASP8 gene contains 8 exons. Hadano et al. (2001) determined that
the CASP8 gene contains 13 exons and spans 51.2 kb.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), Kischkel et al. (1998)
mapped the CASP8 gene to human chromosome 2q33-q34 and mouse chromosome
1B-proximal C. This mapping further extended the known homology of
synteny between these regions of human chromosome 2 and mouse chromosome
1. By FISH, Grenet et al. (1999) also mapped the CASP8 gene to 2q33-q34.
They noted that CASP10 (601762), whose product is closely related to
that of CASP8, has been mapped to the same location, indicating that the
2 genes have evolved by tandem duplication.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Liu et al. (2002) identified a naturally occurring deletion of leu62
within the first DED of CASP8 in A431 human vulva squamous carcinoma
cells. This deletion resulted in defective CASP8-dependent apoptosis.
Unlike wildtype CASP8, CASP8 lacking leu62 failed to form oligomers with
wildtype CASP8 and failed to interact with FADD. The mutation did not
effect proteolytic activation by granzyme B, nor did it effect catalytic
activity against PARP.

In 2 affected sibs from a consanguineous family with caspase-8
deficiency (607271), Chun et al. (2002) identified a homozygous mutation
in the CASP8 gene (601763.0001). The patients had defects in the
activation of T and B lymphocytes and natural killer cells, which led to
immunodeficiency.

Soung et al. (2005) analyzed the entire coding region of the CASP8 gene
in 69 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC; 114550), 2 with low-grade
dysplastic nodule (LGDN), 2 with high-grade dysplastic nodule (HGDN),
and 65 without dysplastic nodules, and detected a total of 9 somatic
mutations (13%). All 9 mutations were an identical 2-bp deletion
(nucleotides 1225-1226; 601763.0002), which was predicted to result in
frameshift and premature termination of amino acid synthesis in the p10
protease subunit. The change was detected both in HCC and in LGDN
lesions, suggesting that CASP8 mutation may be involved in the early
stage of HCC carcinogenesis. Soung et al. (2005) found that expression
of the tumor-derived caspase-8 mutant in cells abolished cell death
activity of caspase-8.

Cox et al. (2007) reported the findings of the Breast Cancer Association
Consortium (BCAC), which had been established to conduct combined
case-control analyses with augmented statistical power to try to confirm
putative genetic associations with breast cancer. They genotyped 9 SNPs
for which there was some prior evidence of an association with breast
cancer (114480). They included data from 9 to 15 studies, comprising
11,391 to 18,290 cases and 14,753 to 22,670 controls. They found
evidence of a protective association with breast cancer for a D302H
polymorphism in CASP8 (601763.0003), and weaker evidence for an L10P SNP
in the TGFB1 gene (190180.0007). These results demonstrated that common
breast cancer susceptibility alleles with small effects on risk can be
identified, given sufficiently powerful studies.

Caspases are important in the life and death of immune cells and
therefore influence immune surveillance of malignancies. Sun et al.
(2007) tested whether genetic variants in CASP8, CASP10, (601762), and
CFLAR (603599), 3 genes important for death receptor-induced cell
killing residing in tandem order on chromosome 2q33, are associated with
cancer susceptibility. Using a haplotype-tagging SNP approach, they
identified a 6-nucleotide deletion (-652 6N del) variant in the CASP8
promoter (601763.0004) associated with decreased risk of lung cancer.
The deletion destroyed a binding site for stimulatory protein-1 (SP1;
189906) and decreased transcription. Biochemical analyses showed that T
lymphocytes with the deletion variant had lower caspase-8 activity and
activation-induced cell death upon stimulation with cancer cell
antigens. Case-control analyses of 4,995 individuals with cancer and
4,972 controls in a Chinese population showed that this genetic variant
is associated with reduced susceptibility to multiple cancers, including
lung, esophageal, gastric, colorectal, cervical, and breast cancers,
acting in an allele dose-dependent manner. The results supported the
hypothesis that genetic variants influencing immune status modify cancer
susceptibility. Haiman et al. (2008) did not find an association between
this SNP and breast (114480), colorectal (114500), or prostate (176807)
cancer among 2,098, 1,139, and 2,825 patients, respectively. The study
included patients in Hawaii and California of various ethnic groups.

ANIMAL MODEL

Varfolomeev et al. (1998) generated mice deficient in Casp8 by
disrupting exons 1 and 2, which encode the N-terminal death effector
domains (DEDs) that interact with MORT1/FADD. Whereas wildtype and
heterozygous mice appeared normal, no homozygous mutant mice survived
beyond approximately embryonic day 13.5. Histopathologic analysis
revealed marked abdominal hyperemia with erythrocytosis in the liver,
major blood vessels, capillaries, and other organs. Cardiac ventricular
musculature was thin and similar to early mesenchyme. Colony forming
assays showed that hemopoietic precursor cells were markedly reduced in
the mutant mice. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis indicated
that fibroblasts from mutant mice responded normally to the noncytocidal
effects of tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR; 191190) and death
receptor-3 (DR3, or TNFRSF12; 603366) stimulation, whereas wildtype
fibroblasts were killed by TNF (191160) treatment or FAS cross-linking.
Agents such as ultraviolet irradiation and protein kinase inhibitors
were lethal for mutant and normal fibroblasts. Varfolomeev et al. (1998)
concluded that CASP8 is necessary for death induction by receptors of
the TNF/nerve growth factor (see NGFR; 162010) family and is vital in
embryonal development.

Zender et al. (2003) evaluated the efficacy of small interfering RNA
(siRNA) in vivo in different mouse models with acute liver failure. They
directed 21-nucleotide siRNAs against caspase-8, which is a key enzyme
in death receptor-mediated apoptosis. Systemic administration of
caspase-8 siRNA resulted in inhibition of caspase-8 gene expression in
the liver, therefore preventing CD95-mediated apoptosis. Protection of
hepatocytes by caspase-8 siRNA significantly attenuated acute liver
damage induced by CD95 antibody or by adenovirus expressing FAS ligand.
In a clinical situation, siRNAs would most likely be administered after
the onset of acute liver failure. Therefore, Zender et al. (2003)
injected caspase-8 siRNA at a time during experimentally-induced liver
failure with already elevated liver transaminases. Improvement of
survival due to RNA interference was significant even when caspase-8
siRNA was applied during ongoing acute liver failure.

Salmena and Hakem (2005) used the Cre/lox recombinase system to generate
mice lacking Casp8 only in T cells (Tcasp8 -/- mice). Tcasp8 -/- mice
developed an age-dependent lethal lymphoproliferative and
lymphoinfiltrative immune disorder characterized by lymphoadenopathy,
splenomegaly, and T-cell infiltrates in lung, liver, and kidney.
Although there was lymphopenia in young Tcasp8 -/- mice, peripheral T
cells in old Tcasp8 -/- mice proliferated in the absence of infection or
stimulation. Salmena and Hakem (2005) proposed that Tcasp8 -/- mice may
serve as a model of human CASP8 deficiency and that CASP8 in T cells is
required for lymphocyte homeostasis.

To define the contribution of reduced caspase-8 to a wound healing
response, Lee et al. (2009) generated an epidermal knockout of
caspase-8. By postnatal day 10 the conditional knockout mouse had flaky
skin throughout its body, was slightly runted, and its epidermis was
dramatically thickened. Lee et al. (2009) found that even though
caspase-8 is normally expressed in the granular layer, it was the basal
and spinous layers that were markedly expanded in the knockout
epidermis. Lee et al. (2009) demonstrated that the loss of epidermal
caspase-8, an important mediator of apoptosis, recapitulated several
phases of a wound healing response in the mouse. The epidermal
hyperplasia in the caspase-8 null skin is the culmination of signals
exchanged between epidermal keratinocytes, dermal fibroblasts, and
leukocytic cells. This reciprocal interaction is initiated by the
paracrine signaling of interleukin 1-alpha (IL1-alpha; 147760), which
activates both skin stem cell proliferation and cutaneous inflammation.
The noncanonical secretion of IL1-alpha is induced by a p38-MAPK
(600289)-mediated upregulation of NALP3 (606416), leading to
inflammasome assembly and caspase-1 activation. Notably, the increased
proliferation of basal keratinocytes is counterbalanced by the growth
arrest of suprabasal keratinocytes in the stratified epidermis by
IL1-alpha-dependent NF-kappa-B (see 164011) signaling. Lee et al. (2009)
concluded that their findings illustrated how the loss of caspase-8 can
affect more than programmed cell death to alter the local
microenvironment and elicit processes common to wound repair and many
neoplastic skin disorders.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CASPASE 8 DEFICIENCY
CASP8, ARG248TRP

In 2 affected sibs from a consanguineous family with caspase-8
deficiency (607271), Chun et al. (2002) identified a homozygous C-to-T
transition in the CASP8 gene, resulting in an arg248-to-trp (R248W)
substitution within the p18 protease subunit of the protein. The
asymptomatic mother, father, and sister were heterozygous carriers of
the mutation. In 13 extended family members, Chun et al. (2002)
identified 7 asymptomatic heterozygous carriers but found no additional
homozygous or immunodeficient individuals.

.0002
HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA, SOMATIC
CASP8, 2-BP DEL, 1225TG

In 9 unrelated patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (114550) and HBV
infection, Soung et al. (2005) identified the same somatic mutation, a
2-bp deletion (1225_1226delTG) in exon 7 that was predicted to result in
frameshift and premature termination of amino acid synthesis in the p10
protease subunit.

.0003
BREAST CANCER, PROTECTION AGAINST
CASP8, ASP302HIS

MacPherson et al. (2004) and Frank et al. (2005) found evidence that the
presence of a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the CASP8 gene
resulting in an asp302-to-his (D302H) substitution (dbSNP rs1045485)
could reduce susceptibility to breast cancer (114480) in British and
German cohorts, respectively. Cox et al. (2007) found evidence for a
protective effect of the D302H polymorphism in an allele dose-dependent
manner in 16,423 cases and 17,109 controls from 14 studies that
contributed data to the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC). The
study achieved odds ratios of 0.89 and 0.74 for heterozygotes and rare
homozygotes, respectively, compared with common homozygotes. This site
was not found to be polymorphic in Korean, Han Chinese, or Japanese
women. Cox et al. (2007) noted that the functional consequences of the
aspartic acid-to-histidine substitution were not known, and further
experiments were required to establish whether D302H itself or another
variant in strong linkage disequilibrium with it is causative.

.0004
LUNG CANCER, PROTECTION AGAINST
CASP8, 6-BP DEL, NT-652

Sun et al. (2007) identified a 6-nucleotide insertion/deletion
polymorphism in the CASP8 promoter, -652 AGTAAG ins/del (dbSNP
rs3834129), the deletion variant of which was associated with decreased
risk of developing lung cancer (211980) in a population of Han Chinese
subjects. The -652 6N deletion was also associated with decreased risk
of cancer of various other forms including esophageal, gastric,
colorectal, cervical, and breast, acting in an allele dose-dependent
manner. The frequency of the -652 6N deletion was significantly lower in
individuals with lung cancer (P = 4.1 x 10(-5)).

Haiman et al. (2008) did not find an association between this SNP and
breast (114480), colorectal (114500), or prostate (176807) cancer among
2,098, 1,139, and 2,825 patients, respectively. The study included
patients in Hawaii and California of various ethnic groups.

614423	TITLE *614423 TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN 237; TMEM237
;;ALS2 CHROMOSOME REGION GENE 4; ALS2CR4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TMEM237 is a tetraspanin protein localized to the ciliary transition
zone that is predicted to function with other transition zone proteins
in canonical and noncanonical Wnt (see 164820) signaling (Huang et al.,
2011).

CLONING

Huang et al. (2011) identified 2 TMEM237 splice variants that include
either exon 1 or exon 2 and are translated into 2 different protein
isoforms. Transcript-1 contains exon 1 and encodes a deduced 408-amino
acid protein, designated isoform A, that has a long N-terminal domain,
followed by 4 transmembrane domains and a short C-terminal tail. Both
the N- and C-terminal domains are intracellular. The N-terminal domain
and the intracellular loops between the transmembrane helices contain
short repetitive motifs of basic (arg and/or lys) and acidic (asp and/or
glu) residues that are highly conserved in metazoans. Immunocytochemical
staining of polarized ciliated mouse inner medullary collecting duct
(IMCD3) cells revealed that Tmem237 localized to the transition zone at
the proximal region of primary cilia.

Zuniga and Craft (2010) cloned mouse Tmem237, which they called Als2cr4,
and identified variants encoding 2 protein isoforms that differ only at
the extreme N terminus. The deduced 403-amino acid protein encoded by
Als2cr4 transcript-2 has a calculated molecular mass of about 45 kD and
shares 81% and 82% identity with isoforms A and B of human ALS2CR4,
respectively. Mouse Als2cr4 has a long N-terminal domain containing a
tetratricopeptide motif, followed by 4 transmembrane segments and a
short C-terminal tail. Zuniga and Craft (2010) noted that previous in
situ hybridization and gene expression profiles revealed high Als2cr4
expression in eye, hippocampus, cerebellum, and olfactory bulb. By
immunohistochemical analysis of retina, Zuniga and Craft (2010) found
Als2cr4 enriched in retina and localized to photoreceptor outer
segments, ciliary complex, and horizontal cells in the outer plexiform
layer. Immunoelectron microscopy verified Als2cr4 expression in the
discs of photoreceptor outer segments.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of mouse retina, Zuniga and Craft (2010)
found that Als2cr4 interacted with Arr4 (ARR3; 301770).
Immunoprecipitation analysis of light-adapted mouse retinas showed that
Als2cr4 associated with cytoskeletal components. Als2cr4 interacted
directly with myosin Va (MYO5A; 160777), myosin VI (MYO6; 600970), and
Arr3.

Huang et al. (2011) found that knockdown of Tmem237 in IMCD3 cells via
small interfering RNA impaired ciliogenesis and caused mislocalization
of RhoA (165390) to peripheral regions of the basal body and to
basolateral cell-cell contacts. Similarly, fibroblasts from a patient
with Joubert syndrome-14 (JBTS14; 614424) and a null mutation in TMEM237
(R18X; 614423.0001) showed deregulation of canonical and noncanonical
Wnt signaling and mislocalization of RHOA. Morpholino-mediated knockdown
of Tmem237 in zebrafish caused gastrulation defects consistent with
ciliary dysfunction that were similar to defects resulting from
knockdown of other transition zone proteins, including Mks3 (TMEM67;
609884) and Tmem216 (613277). These defects in zebrafish were partially
reversed by expression of human TMEM237, MKS3, or TMEM216. In both IMCD3
cells and C. elegans, transition zone localization of Tmem237 was
dependent upon other transition zone proteins. Huang et al. (2011)
hypothesized that TMEM237, TMEM216, and MKS3 function as a module to
regulate ciliogenesis and WNT signaling.

GENE STRUCTURE

Huang et al. (2011) determined that the TMEM237 gene contains 14 exons
and spans 23 kb.

MAPPING

Zuniga and Craft (2010) stated that the human TMEM237 gene maps to
chromosome 2q33.2 and that the mouse ortholog maps to chromosome 1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By homozygosity mapping followed by candidate gene analysis in 10
related Canadian Hutterite families with Joubert syndrome-14 (JBTS14;
614424), Huang et al. (2011) identified a homozygous truncating mutation
in the TMEM237 gene (R18X; 614423.0001). Homozygous or compound
heterozygous mutations were also found in 3 additional families with the
disorder (614423.0002-614423.0005). All the mutations were predicted to
result in a null allele. Protein extracts from patient cells showed
perturbation of the noncanonical WNT pathway, with constitutive
phosphorylation and hyperactivation of DVL1 (601365) and an increase in
CTNNB1 (116806) levels. There was also an increase in RHOA signaling.
The phenotype was characterized by severe mental retardation, abnormal
breathing pattern in infancy, molar tooth sign (MTS) on brain imaging,
renal cysts, abnormal eye movements, and early death in many patients.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
JOUBERT SYNDROME 14
TMEM237, ARG18TER (dbSNP rs199469707)

In affected members of 10 related Canadian Hutterite families with
Joubert syndrome-14 (JBTS14; 614424) (Boycott et al., 2007), Huang et
al. (2011) identified a homozygous 52C-T transition in the TMEM237 gene,
resulting in an arg18-to-ter (R18X) substitution. Screening of normal
Hutterite controls showed a carrier frequency of 6% for this mutation.
The mutation was not found in over 105 northern European controls.
TMEM237 transcript levels were reduced by 99.6% in patient fibroblasts,
and these cells showed defective ciliogenesis and pairing of centrioles
compared to control cells.

Chong et al. (2012) identified a carrier frequency for this mutation of
0.080 (1 in 12.5) among Schmiedeleut (S-leut) Hutterites in the United
States. This mutation is private to the Hutterite population.

.0002
JOUBERT SYNDROME 14
TMEM237, IVS9DS, G-T, +1

In affected members of a consanguineous Austrian family with Joubert
syndrome-14 (614424) (Janecke et al., 2004), Huang et al. (2011)
identified a homozygous G-to-T transversion in intron 9 of the TMEM237
gene (677+1G-T). RT-PCR analysis and sequencing of a patient's
fibroblasts showed 2 aberrant transcripts: one resulting in the deletion
of 65 amino acids and the insertion of a serine residue, and another
resulting in the skipping of exon 9 and premature termination. TMEM237
transcript levels were reduced by 98.4% in patient fibroblasts, and
these cells showed defective ciliogenesis and pairing of centrioles
compared to control cells.

.0003
JOUBERT SYNDROME 14
TMEM237, 1-BP DUP, 1066C

In a Jordanian child, born of consanguineous parents, with JBTS14
(614424), Huang et al. (2011) identified a homozygous 1-bp duplication
(1066dupC) in exon 13 of the TMEM237 gene, predicted to result in a
frameshift and premature termination. The mutation was not found in over
105 Jordanian controls.

.0004
JOUBERT SYNDROME 14
TMEM237, GLN26TER

In a child of European and Spanish descent with JBTS14 (614424), Huang
et al. (2011) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
TMEM237 gene: a maternally inherited 76C-T transition, resulting in a
gln26-to-ter (Q26X) substitution, and a paternally inherited G-to-T
transversion in intron 11 (943+1G-T; 614423.0005), resulting in an
in-frame deletion of 56 amino acids (exons 11 and 12). The mutations
were not found in over 105 controls.

165161	TITLE *165161 ONCOGENE JUN-B; JUNB
DESCRIPTION 
GENE FUNCTION

Jacobs-Helber et al. (2002) studied the role of JUNB in erythroid
differentiation in an erythropoietin (EPO; 133170)-dependent cell line
and in primary mouse and human erythroid cells. They identified an
initial EPO-dependent induction of JUNB expression that was insufficient
to induce differentiation. A second EPO-independent peak of JUNB
expression was associated with erythroid cell differentiation as
measured by increased expression of erythroid-specific proteins.

Mathas et al. (2002) found AP1 constitutively activated, with robust JUN
(165160) and JUNB overexpression, in all cell lines derived from
patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma (236000) and anaplastic large
cell lymphoma (ALCL), but not in other lymphoma types. AP1 supported
proliferation of Hodgkin cells, but suppressed apoptosis of ALCL cells.
Mathas et al. (2002) noted that, whereas JUN is upregulated by an
autoregulatory process, JUNB is under the control of nuclear factor
kappa-B (NFKB; 164011). They found that AP1 and NFKB cooperate and
stimulate expression of the cell cycle regulator cyclin D2 (123833), the
protooncogene MET (164860), and the lymphocyte homing receptor CCR7
(600242), which are all strongly expressed in primary
Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells.

Gao et al. (2004) found in the case of c-JUN and JUNB that extracellular
stimuli modulate protein turnover by regulating the activity of an E3
ligase by means of its phosphorylation. Activation of the Jun
amino-terminal kinase (JNK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
cascade after T cell stimulation accelerated degradation of c-JUN and
JUNB through phosphorylation-dependent activation of the E3 ligase ITCH
(606409). Gao et al. (2004) found that this pathway modulates cytokine
production by effector T cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

In comparisons of the murine and human junB loci, Phinney et al. (1995)
found 9 regions of distal 5-prime and 3-prime flanking DNA that
exhibited greater than 72% sequence identity. More than 50% of the JUNB
locus is contained in these flanking evolutionarily conserved sequences
(FECSs), which may be required for effecting the proper transcriptional
regulation of the gene. Comparative sequence analyses involving
kilobases of distal flanking DNAs for only a small number of vertebrate
genes suggested that FECSs may emerge as common yet important functional
components of genes. If they account for a large fraction of the
conserved sequence within a disease-related locus, then deleterious
mutations might frequently occur in these regions and go undetected with
current strategies.

Zenz et al. (2005) found reduced JunB expression in lesional skin of
severe psoriasis and intermediate expression in mild psoriasis.

MAPPING

Mattei et al. (1990) mapped 3 members of the JUN protooncogene family in
the mouse: JUN to mouse chromosome 4 and JUNB and JUND (165162) to the
same region of mouse chromosome 8. RFLP analysis of interspecific
hybrids confirmed the mapping of JUNB and JUND and showed that they are
situated about 7.3 cM apart. Using the same probes for in situ
hybridization, Mattei et al. (1990) showed that the human genes are
located on 19p13.2, a region that is involved in chromosome
translocations in cases of leukemia. By fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Trask et al. (1993) assigned the JUNB gene to 19p13.2.

ANIMAL MODEL

Passegue et al. (2001) created transgenic mice specifically lacking JunB
expression in the myeloid lineage. These mice developed a transplantable
myeloproliferative disease, eventually progressing to blast crisis, that
resembled human chronic myeloid leukemia. Similarly, mice reconstituted
with embryonic stem cell-derived JunB -/- fetal liver cells also
developed a myeloproliferative disease. In both cases, the absence of
JunB expression resulted in increased numbers of granulocyte progenitors
that displayed enhanced granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor
(GMCSF, or CSF2; 138960)-mediated proliferation and extended survival,
associated with changes in the expression levels of the GMCSF
receptor-alpha (CSF2RA; 306250), the antiapoptotic proteins BCL2
(151430) and BCLX (600039), and the cell cycle regulators p16INK4A
(CDKN2A; 600160) and JUN. Ectopic expression of JunB fully reverted the
immature and hyperproliferative phenotype of JunB-deficient myeloid
cells. These results identified JUNB as a key transcriptional regulator
of myelopoiesis and a potential tumor suppressor gene.

Passegue et al. (2004) investigated the function of JunB during normal
and leukemic hematopoiesis using a JunB transgenic mouse model
associated with myeloproliferative disorder (Passegue et al., 2001), as
well as several models of conditional inactivation and overexpression of
JunB in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). They showed that JunB regulates
the numbers of HSCs. JunB overexpression decreased the frequency of
long-term HSCs, while JunB inactivation specifically expanded the
numbers of long-term HSCs and granulocyte/macrophage progenitors,
resulting in chronic myeloproliferative disorder. Passegue et al. (2004)
demonstrated that JunB inactivation must have taken place in long-term
HSCs, and not at later stages of myelopoiesis, to induce
myeloproliferative disorder, and that only JunB-deficient long-term HSCs
were capable of transplanting the myeloproliferative disorder to
recipient mice. These results demonstrated a stem cell-specific role for
JunB in normal and leukemic hematopoiesis and provided experimental
evidence that leukemic stem cells can reside at the long-term HSC stage
of development in a mouse model of myeloproliferative disorder.

The JUN and JUNB components of the AP1 transcription factor are known to
have antagonistic functions. Passegue et al. (2002) showed, by a knockin
strategy and a transgenic complementation approach, that JunB can
substitute for absence of Jun during mouse development. JunB can rescue
both liver and cardiac defects in Jun-null mice in a manner dependent on
gene dosage. JunB restores the expression of genes regulated by Jun/Fos
(164810), but not those regulated by Jun/ATF (ATF1; 123803), thereby
rescuing Jun-dependent defects in vivo as well as in primary fibroblasts
and fetal hepatoblasts in vitro. Thus, the transcriptionally less active
JunB has the potential to substitute for Jun, indicating that the
spatial and temporal regulation of expression of the transcription
factor AP1 may be more important than the coding sequence of its
components.

Zenz et al. (2005) designed inducible, conditional, single- and
double-knockout mice for JunB and c-Jun. Mutant mice and littermate
controls were treated with tamoxifen at 8 weeks of age. Single-mutant
mice did not show any skin phenotype up to 2 months after deletion.
However, in JunB/c-Jun double-mutant mice, alterations to the hairless
skin appeared 8 to 10 days after tamoxifen induction. After 18 days of
tamoxifen treatment, 100% of the double-mutant mice showed a strong
phenotype with scaly plaques affecting primarily ears, paws, and tail,
and less frequently the hairy back skin. Histology of affected skin from
mutant mice showed the hallmarks of psoriasis, such as a strongly
thickened epidermis with prominent rete ridges, thickened keratinized
upper layers (hyperkeratosis) and parakeratosis (nucleated keratinocytes
in the cornified layer) and increased subepidermal vascularization.
Arthritic lesions strongly reminiscent of psoriatic arthritis were
observed with 100% penetrance.

604977	TITLE *604977 SERINE/THREONINE PROTEIN KINASE 19; STK19
;;HLA-RP1
DESCRIPTION Phosphorylation events are key to most nuclear and cytoplasmic
processes. Cellular protein kinases and phosphatases are involved in the
regulation of differentiation, cell division, transcription, and DNA
repair. Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation can either activate or
inactivate other proteins.

In addition to the class I, II, and III genes of the major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) in 6p21.3, other genes may be involved
in the susceptibility to autoimmune and immunodeficiency diseases
associated with various MHC types. By screening cDNA libraries using a
DNA fragment upstream of the C4A gene (120810), which is localized to
the class III region of the MHC, followed by RT-PCR, Shen et al. (1994)
isolated a cDNA encoding STK19, which they named RP in honor of the
Nobel laureate immunochemist Sir Rodney R. Porter. The predicted
364-amino acid STK19 protein has an extremely hydrophilic N-terminal
half and a C-terminal half with alternating hydrophilic and hydrophobic
regions. STK19 contains a positively charged putative nuclear
localization signal, multiple potential phosphorylation sites, 2
amidation sites, 9 potential N-myristoylation sites, and no
N-glycosylation sites. Northern blot analysis of various cell lines
revealed ubiquitous expression of a 1.6- to 1.8-kb STK19 transcript.
Shen et al. (1994) determined that the STK19 gene contains 9 exons and
is located 611 bp upstream of the C4A gene. The 5-prime region of the
STK19 gene is rich in CpG sequences, which is typical of a housekeeping
gene, and there are 8 Alu elements in intron 4.

By screening BamHI-digested DNA on a zoo blot using a CpG island-rich
probe derived from an MHC cosmid clone, followed by screening a phorbol
ester-stimulated monocytic cell line using a genomic DNA fragment
upstream of the C4A gene, Sargent et al. (1994) isolated a cDNA encoding
a 258-amino acid STK19 protein. The authors referred to the STK19 gene
as G11 and the 258-amino acid protein as G11-Y. They also identified an
inphase STK19 splice variant of 254 amino acids. Homology searches found
limited sequence similarity with a number of proteins; the most
significant similarity was with the tyrosine kinase transforming protein
of fujinami sarcoma virus. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.4-kb
STK19 transcript in multiple cell lines, suggesting ubiquitous
expression. Genomic sequence analysis using the G11-Y cDNA indicated
that the STK19 gene contains 7 exons and spans 9.1 kb.

Gomez-Escobar et al. (1998) showed that the 368-amino acid STK19 protein
(Shen et al., 1994), which they termed G11-Z, and the 258-amino acid
STK19 protein (G11-Y; Sargent et al., 1994), which lacks the N-terminal
110 amino acids present in G11-Z, are both intracellular proteins.
Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses determined that the STK19
gene is expressed as 41.5-kD (G11-Z) and 30-kD (G11-Y) proteins.
Functional analysis demonstrated that STK19 has a manganese-dependent
protein kinase activity that phosphorylates alpha-casein (CSN1; 115450)
at ser/thr residues and histone (see 142711) at ser residues.
Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that STK19 is localized primarily
in the nucleus.

602151	TITLE *602151 DISHEVELLED 2; DVL2
DESCRIPTION See DVL1 (601365) for a discussion of this gene family.

CLONING

Semenov and Snyder (1997) isolated 3 human genes encoding proteins
homologous to the Drosophila dishevelled (dsh) protein. The clones were
obtained by serendipity while screening a human placental expression
library. Additional clones were obtained by screening the same library
with a DVL2 probe and by PCR. The cDNA sequences for DVL1, DVL2, and
DVL3 (601368) were determined for the coding region of each gene and
predicts proteins of 670, 736, and 716 amino acids, respectively.
Comparison of the protein sequences revealed that they share 59 to 67%
amino acid sequence identity. More than 95% amino acid sequence identity
is shared between the corresponding human and mouse orthologs. The
vertebrate dishevelled proteins have approximately 40% amino acid
sequence identity with Drosophila dsh. Semenov and Snyder (1997)
demonstrated that DVL2 encodes a 90-kD protein that undergoes
posttranslational phosphorylation to form a 95-kD cytoplasmic protein in
a variety of cell lines and species. Their results suggested that the
mechanisms of dishevelled function in Wnt signaling (see 164820) are
likely to be conserved among metazoans.

Chen et al. (2003) found that endocytosis of frizzled-4 (FZD4; 604579)
in human embryonic kidney cells was dependent on added WNT5A (164975)
protein and was accomplished by the multifunctional adaptor protein
beta-arrestin-2 (107941), which was recruited to FZD4 by binding to
phosphorylated DVL2. The authors concluded that their findings provided
a previously unrecognized mechanism for receptor recruitment of
beta-arrestin and demonstrated that dishevelled plays an important role
in the endocytosis of frizzled, as well as in promoting signaling.

GENE FUNCTION

Capelluto et al. (2002) noted that DVL proteins contain a conserved
85-residue functional module called the DIX domain. Immunolocalization
of endogenous Dvl2 in CHO cells showed colocalization with actin stress
fibers. Dvl2 also showed a punctate pattern, suggesting distribution in
cytoplasmic vesicles. By mutation analysis of mouse Dvl2 expressed in
CHO cells, they identified an actin-binding motif within the DIX domain.
A lys58-to-ala mutation within this motif abolished the cytoskeletal
localization of Dvl2 in CHO cells but enhanced Wnt/beta-catenin (116806)
signaling and induced axis duplication upon injection into Xenopus
embryos. Capelluto et al. (2002) also identified a phospholipid
interaction site and found that mutation of this site (lys68 to ala and
glu69 to ala) disrupted vesicular association, Dvl2 phosphorylation, and
activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. They concluded that the DIX
domain partitions DVL proteins into cytoskeletal and vesicular pools,
committing them to distinct signaling pathways.

Huang et al. (2013) found that ectopic RIPK4 (605706), but not
catalytically inactive or Bartsocas-Papas (263650) RIPK4 mutants,
induced accumulation of cytosolic beta-catenin (116806) and a
transcription program similar to that caused by WNT3A (606359). In
Xenopus embryos, Ripk4 synergized with coexpressed Xenopus Wnt8, whereas
Ripk4 morpholinos or catalytic inactive Ripk4 antagonized Wnt signaling.
RIPK4 interacted constitutively with the adaptor protein DVL2 and, after
WNT3A stimulation, with the coreceptor LRP6 (603507). Phosphorylation of
DVL2 by RIPK4 favored canonical Wnt signaling. WNT-dependent growth of
xenografted human tumor cells was suppressed by RIPK4 knockdown,
suggesting that RIPK4 overexpression may contribute to the growth of
certain tumor types.

MAPPING

Greco et al. (1996) mapped the human homolog of Drosophila dishevelled-2
to chromosome 17 by analysis of somatic cell hybrid panels. The mouse
gene mapped to mouse chromosome 11, distal to Wnt3a and vestigial tail
(vt).

609618	TITLE *609618 NONCODING REPRESSOR OF NFAT; NRON
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), a remarkably sensitive
transcription factor responsive to local changes in calcium signals, is
essential for T cell receptor-mediated immune response and plays a
critical role in the development of heart and vasculature, musculature,
and nervous tissue. See 600489. Willingham et al. (2005) selected 512
mouse noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) with significant human homology and
designed short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) against the human orthologs of
these sequences. Using cell-based knockdown assays, they identified 1
ncRNA that, when targeted with shRNAs, resulted in a dramatic activation
of NFAT activity. Willingham et al. (2005) termed this ncRNA 'noncoding
repressor of NFAT' (NRON). The NRON gene has 2 large 300- to 400-bp
regions of near-perfect sequence conservation between rodents and
primates. NRON is a relatively rare transcript that is enriched in
placenta, muscle, and lymphoid tissues such as the thymus, spleen, and
lymph node. Northern blot analysis of mouse RNA showed significant NRON
expression in embryo and thymus. Willingham et al. (2005) demonstrated a
distinct tissue-specific distribution of NRON splice forms which,
particularly in its enrichment in lymphoid tissues, is consistent with
its role as a modulator of NFAT signaling.

GENE FUNCTION

Willingham et al. (2005) found that NRON specifically interacts with 11
proteins, including 3 members of the importin-beta superfamily, factors
which directly mediate the nucleocytoplasmic transport of cargoes such
as NFAT. Short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) directed against 4 of these 11
putative interactors, a calmodulin-binding protein (IQGAP1; 603379), a
nuclear transport factor (KPNB1; 602738), the structural subunit of a
phosphatase (PPP2R1A; 605983), and a component of the proteasome
(PSMD11; 604449), all activated NFAT activity. cDNA overexpression of
these 4 interactors had the opposite effect and repressed NFAT activity.
Therefore, these 4 proteins, together with NRON, have a repressive
effect on NFAT signaling. Willingham et al. (2005) demonstrated that
cell extracts containing overexpressed importin beta-1 (KPNB1) bound
significantly more NRON than did a nonspecific RNA control, suggesting
that importin beta-1 and NRON directly associate. These and other
findings suggested to Willingham et al. (2005) that NRON functions as an
RNA component of a protein complex that acts to repress NFAT activity.
The authors observed that NRON modulates the calcium-regulated
transcriptional activity of NFATC1 (600849), NFATC2 (600490), NFATC3
(602698), and NFATC4 (602699). Additional data suggested that rather
than directly modulating the transcriptional activity of NFAT itself,
NRON likely regulates NFAT's subcellular localization.

GENE STRUCTURE

Willingham et al. (2005) found that the NRON gene is composed of 3 exons
that can be alternatively spliced to yield transcripts ranging from 0.8
to 3.7 kb.

142310	TITLE *142310 HEMOGLOBIN--ZETA LOCUS; HBZ
;;HEMOGLOBIN ZETA;;
5-PRIME @ZETA LOCUS;;
HEMOGLOBIN ZETA-2, FORMERLY; HBZ2, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION Zeta is an early embryonic chain which is substituted for the alpha
chain in Hb Portland-1. This unique hemoglobin was found in a newborn
infant with multiple congenital anomalies and complex autosomal
chromosomal mosaicism (Capp et al., 1967). Its composition was found to
be gamma(2) X(2). It was originally thought that the X-chain might be
the epsilon chain whose synthesis persisted until after birth because of
the chromosomal anomaly; later work indicated that the X-chain is indeed
different from epsilon and therefore it is now called zeta. Hb
Portland-2 is the designation for zeta(2)-beta(2) found in stillborn
infants with homozygous alpha-thalassemia (Randhawa et al., 1984).

Melderis et al. (1974) presented evidence for the zeta chain being
homologous with the alpha chain. The zeta chains of mice, rabbits and
man showed close similarities to each other and significant similarities
to the alpha chains of these species. Kamuzora and Lehmann (1975) gave
sequence data on the human zeta chain and pointed out a close homology
to the alpha chain. Recombinant DNA experiments at Cambridge University
provided suggestions that the zeta locus may be linked to the alpha loci
(Housman, 1979).

Pressley et al. (1980) presented the findings in 2 infants with
hemoglobin Bart's hydrops fetalis syndrome (homozygous
alpha-thalassemia-1) as evidence that the 5-prime zeta locus is
functional. One of the infants had lost the 3-prime-zeta-1 gene but had
zeta-globin in the cord blood.

In the mouse, Whitney and Russell (1980) concluded that the embryonic
alpha-like gene is closely linked to the gene of adult alpha-globin. In
mouse embryos heterozygous for alpha-thalassemia, they found no decrease
in the proportion of hemoglobins containing the alpha chain as compared
to the hemoglobin containing the alpha-like embryonic globin chain.

Aschauer et al. (1981) found 57 amino acid differences between the zeta
chain and the alpha chain. This finding indicates 'a greater
phylogenetic distance' between alpha-type chains than between the
beta-type chains. Several of the zeta chain replacements are at
positions of structural and functional significance, particularly in
relation to the Bohr effect and high oxygen affinity which characterize
embryonic hemoglobins (Clegg and Gagnon, 1981). The gene order in the
HBAC (hemoglobin alpha cluster) is zeta--11.5
kb--pseudozeta--pseudoalpha--alpha-2--alpha-1. What was formerly called
zeta-2, the locus at the 5-prime end of the alpha-globin cluster, is the
functional gene.

Chung et al. (1984) concluded that deletion of 2 alpha-globin genes on
the same chromosome as in alpha-thalassemia is accompanied by the
continued expression of embryonic zeta-globin genes in adults. The
3-prime zeta-1 gene, a pseudogene, is highly homologous to the
functional 5-prime zeta-2 gene. By genomic mapping and oligonucleotide
analysis, Hill et al. (1985) found chromosomes with a zeta-2--zeta-1
rather than a zeta-2--psi-zeta-1 arrangement. Gene conversion of the
psi-zeta-1 by the psi-zeta-2 gene appears to have happened. In this
interchromosomal process the only identifiable inactivating mutation in
the psi-zeta-1 gene was removed. The zeta-2--zeta-1 arrangement was
common in all 8 populations studied representing a 'new' type of
polymorphism. Stable mRNA transcripts from the converted gene were
absent at 16 to 20 weeks of gestation when transcripts from the zeta-2
gene were readily detectable. Zeta-1 (HBZP), or pseudozeta, is very
similar to zeta-2 but has a premature termination codon.

Felice et al. (1986) found 4 types of chromosomes with a deletion
between the human embryonic zeta- and pseudo-zeta-globin genes among
2.8% of 321 black Americans. These deletions were found in combination
with alpha-globin gene deletions in trans but not in cis. No homozygotes
were identified. Hematologic data on carriers of the zeta-globin gene
deletions in association with hemoglobins AS, SS, and SC suggested that
these deletions have no effect on the function of the adult alpha-globin
genes. In eastern Polynesians, Hill et al. (1987) found a high frequency
of both triplicated zeta-gene chromosomes and a specific
alpha-thalassemia deletion. The deletion and a novel RFLP associated
with a zeta-zeta-zeta chromosome occur only in Melanesians and
Polynesians.

- PSEUDOGENES

The Hb zeta pseudogene is about 11.5 kb to the 3-prime side of the zeta
locus (Proudfoot et al., 1980). Actually there is a length polymorphism
in the segment of DNA that separates the zeta gene from its pseudogene
(Goodbourn et al., 1983). (The Hb zeta pseudogene, HBZP, was formerly
symbolized HBZ1 and referred to as the 3-prime zeta locus or the
psi-zeta locus.)

ANIMAL MODEL

Leder et al. (2005) reported that a Hbz-null mice displayed an
alpha-thalassemia-like syndrome. Embryonic survival of Hbz-null mice was
variable and strongly influenced by genetic background. The authors
identified 2 modifying loci on chromosomes 2 and 5 in the C57BL/6
background, which affected the penetrance of embryonic lethality. The
authors observed an interesting effect on somatic recombination events
in thalassemic embryos. These events occurred on multiple chromosomes in
very early embryonic cells, prior to their allocation to the germline.
Leder et al. (2005) concluded that somatic recombination events can be
transmitted to subsequent generations.

611159	TITLE *611159 KERATIN 78; KRT78
;;KERATIN 5B; K5B
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Keratins, such as KRT78, are filament proteins that make up one of the
major structural fibers of epithelial cells (Rogers et al., 2005).

CLONING

Using database analysis to identify keratin genes within the type II
keratin gene domain on chromosome 12, Rogers et al. (2005) identified
KRT78, which they called K5B. The deduced 520-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 56.8 kD. Like other type II keratins, K5B
has N- and C-terminal domains and a central rod domain consisting of 4
alpha-helical regions separated by 3 non-helical linker sequences.
Northern blot analysis detected expression of a 1.9-kb K5B transcript in
tongue, but not in skin or in any other tissues or organs examined.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Rogers et al. (2005) mapped the KRT78 gene
to chromosome 12q13.13.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Komaki et al. (2003) cloned mouse Pp2c-eta from a 13.5-day embryo cDNA
library. The deduced 406-amino acid protein contains 6 motifs conserved
in all PP2C family members, and it has a unique nuclear localization
signal between motifs III and IV. By database analysis, Komaki et al.
(2003) identified a cDNA encoding human PP2C-eta Northern blot analysis
detected expression of Pp2c-eta in all mouse tissues examined. Strongest
expression was in testis, followed by lung, kidney, brain, heart, and
liver. Pp2c-eta localized mainly to the nucleus of transfected cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Komaki et al. (2003) found that recombinant mouse Pp2c-eta expressed in
E. coli exhibited Mn(2+)-dependent protein phosphatase activity against
a test substrate.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the
PP2C-eta gene to chromosome 3 (TMAP A002C09).

;;ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 463; ZNF463;;
REARRANGED IN THYROID ADENOMAS; RITA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Zinc finger proteins have been shown to interact with nucleic acids and
to have diverse functions. The zinc finger domain is a conserved amino
acid sequence motif containing 2 specifically positioned cysteines and 2
histidines that are involved in coordinating zinc. Kruppel-related
proteins form one family of zinc finger proteins. See ZFP93 (604749) for
additional information on zinc finger proteins.

CLONING

Using a differential display/PCR method, Wu et al. (2001) identified a
novel Kruppel-related zinc finger gene, which they designated ZNF463,
encoding a 463-amino acid protein with an N-terminal KRAB domain and 12
C-terminal C2H2 zinc finger units. Northern blot analysis revealed
testis-restricted expression of a 1.9-kb ZNF463 transcript. RT-PCR
analysis demonstrated higher expression of ZNF463 in normal fertile
adults than in fetuses or patients with azoospermia, suggesting that
ZNF463 may play a role in spermatogenesis.

MAPPING

By FISH, Wu et al. (2001) mapped the ZNF463 gene to chromosome
19q13.3-q13.4. This localization is consistent with the finding of the
ZNF331 gene in the region of 19q13 breakpoints involved in follicular
adenomas of the thyroid gland (Rippe et al., 1999).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Translocations involving 19q13 are a frequent finding in follicular
adenomas of the thyroid and may represent the most frequent type of
structural aberration in human epithelial tumors (Belge et al., 1998).
By positional cloning of the 19q13 breakpoints found in follicular
adenomas of the thyroid gland, Rippe et al. (1999) identified a
candidate gene that they initially referred to as RITA (rearranged in
thyroid adenomas) and renamed ZNF331. Meiboom et al. (2003) reported
unique expression of a 3.4-kb ZNF331 transcript in thyroid adenoma cell
lines with 19q13 aberrations which was not detected either in normal
tissues or in thyroid carcinoma cell lines.

;;NOS3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Tsuda et al. (2003) cloned mouse Nanos3. The deduced protein contains a
zinc finger motif. Nanos3 was expressed in male mouse gonads, in
primordial germ cells (PGCs), in bipotential gonads at embryonic day (E)
11.5, and in female gonads at E12.5.

Using Northern blot analysis in adult human tissues, Kusz et al. (2009)
demonstrated that NANOS3 is testis-specific.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Possible Association with Male Infertility

Kusz et al. (2009) analyzed the NANOS3 gene in 214 Polish men with
nonobstructive infertility (see 258150) ranging from azoospermia to
oligospermia, who all had normal karyotypes and no apparent AZF region
microdeletions on the Y chromosome (415000). Of 6 variants detected,
only 1 was not present in fertile men: an intronic deletion near the
5-prime donor site (655delG) that was identified in 1 azoospermic
patient with a mixed phenotype of hypospermatogenesis and testis
atrophy.

ANIMAL MODEL

Tsuda et al. (2003) found that Nanos3-null mice were viable and showed
no apparent abnormalities, but the size of ovaries and testes in
Nanos3-null mice was greatly reduced. Morphologic examination revealed
only a few germ cells in the E12.5 genital ridge, and none were found in
adult gonads. The specification and derivation of PGCs appeared normal,
but PGCs were not subsequently maintained during migration. Apoptosis
did not appear to cause the depletion of PGCs in Nanos3-null embryos.

148065	TITLE *148065 KERATIN 13; KRT13
;;K13;;
CYTOKERATIN 13
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Keratin intermediate filaments (KIFs) are assembled from heterodimeric
subunits comprised of a type I and a type II protein. Keratin-13 (KRT13)
is a member of the type I (acidic) subfamily of genes characteristic of
the internal stratified epithelia (Romano et al., 1991).

MAPPING

By PCR amplification with cytokeratin 13-specific DNA antimers of a
human-hamster somatic cell hybrid DNA panel, Romano et al. (1991) mapped
the KRT13 gene to chromosome 17. By means of in situ hybridization, they
determined the subchromosomal localization to be 17q12-q22. They further
analyzed this region by pulsed field gel electrophoresis and
demonstrated that the KRT13 gene is in the same large DNA fragment as
the KRT10 (148080) and KRT15 (148030) genes. Further experiments
performed with conventional agarose gel electrophoresis showed that the
KRT10 and KRT13 genes are located in the same 14-kb fragment. A
correlation of assignments of the 3 genes makes 17q21-q22 the likely
location of the cluster. Romano et al. (1992) gave the location as
17q12-q21.2.

Ceratto et al. (1997) isolated and analyzed a YAC clone that mapped to
17q12-q21 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. By Southern analysis
and pulsed field gel electrophoresis they concluded that KRT13, KRT14
(148066), KRT15, KRT16, and the linked type I genes KRT17 (148069) and
KRT19 (148020), are contained in less than 150 kb of genomic DNA.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of a multigenerational Italian family segregating
white sponge nevus (193900), Richard et al. (1995) identified
heterozygosity for a missense mutation in the KRT13 gene (148065.0001).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
WHITE SPONGE NEVUS
KRT13, LEU15PRO

In a multigeneration Italian family with white sponge nevus (193900),
Richard et al. (1995) demonstrated a T-to-C transition changing codon 15
of the KRT13 gene from CTG (leu) to CCG (pro) (L15P). The mutation was
in the 1A subdomain of keratin 13. Substitution of C for T created a
unique MspI recognition site that resulted in cleavage of amplified DNA
on MspI digestion. Richard et al. (1995) mutations in the precise
corresponding residue have been described in keratin-9 (L15S;
607606.0008) in epidermolytic palmoplantar hyperkeratosis by Rothnagel
et al. (1995), in keratin 10 (L15S; 148080.0002) in epidermolytic
hyperkeratosis, and of keratin 16 (L15P; 148067.0001) in pachyonychia
congenita.

Richard et al. (1995) numbered this mutation starting with the first
residue in the 1A domain of KRT13. This mutation is also known as
LEU119PRO.

602102	TITLE *602102 SUPPRESSOR OF TY 5, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; SUPT5H
;;CHROMATIN STRUCTURE REGULATOR, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF; SPT5
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The yeast suppressor of Ty (SPT) genes were isolated based on their
ability to suppress insertion of the Ty transposable element. These
genes encode a variety of proteins that are involved in chromosome
activity, including histones and transcription factors. The SPT genes
are not necessarily homologs of one another. SPT4 (603555), SPT5, and
SPT6 (601333) are believed to be parts of a protein complex involved in
transcriptional repression by modulating chromatin structure. Chiang et
al. (1996) and Stachora et al. (1997) cloned and characterized cDNAs
encoding the human homolog of yeast SPT5. Chiang et al. (1996) reported
that the gene, symbolized SUPT5H, encodes a 1,087-amino acid polypeptide
with 50% similarity to yeast SPT5. The N terminus of SUPT5H is highly
acidic, while the C terminus contains 7 mitogen-activated protein (MAP)
kinase consensus sequences. Stachora et al. (1997) noted that the SUPT5H
sequence contains a putative nuclear localization signal. By Northern
blotting, Chiang et al. (1996) showed that SUPT5H was expressed as a
4-kb transcript at varying levels in every adult human tissue tested.

Chiang et al. (1998) isolated a cDNA encoding mouse Supt5h. The deduced
mouse and human SUPT5H proteins share 97% sequence identity.

GENE FUNCTION

Stachora et al. (1997) showed that levels of SUPT5H protein did not vary
during the cell cycle of HeLa cells. However, the protein was reversibly
phosphorylated during mitosis.

Yamada et al. (2006) showed that D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole
sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF), a heterodimer of SPT4 and SPT5,
repressed or activated transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II in
HeLa cells based on the phosphorylation status of SPT5.

MAPPIN Using somatic cell hybrids and radiation hybrids, {1:Chiang

et al. (1996) mapped the SUPT5H gene to human chromosome 19q13.
Screening of a cosmid contig localized the gene to about 250 kb
telomeric to the CLC locus (153310) and about 1 Mb centromeric to the
AKT2 oncogene (164731), placing it at 19q13.1. By analysis of an
interspecific backcross, Chiang et al. (1996) mapped the Supt5h gene to
mouse chromosome 7 in a region showing homology of synteny with human
19q13.1-q13.2.

ANIMAL MODEL

Guo et al. (2000) described a zebrafish mutant called 'foggy,' which was
identified in a genetic screen from mutations that affect neuronal
development. The foggy zebrafish displayed a reduction of
dopamine-containing neurons and a corresponding surplus of
serotonin-containing neurons in the hypothalamus. Positional cloning
disclosed that foggy is a brain-enriched nuclear protein that is
structurally related to the yeast transcription elongation factor SPT5
and to human SUPT5H. Foggy is a 1,084-amino acids protein, while SUPT5H
is 1,087 amino acids. In conserved regions, there is 88 to 96% amino
acid identity between zebrafish and human. Foggy is not part of the
basic transcription apparatus but is a phosphorylation-dependent dual
regulator of transcription elongation. The foggy mutation (val1012 to
asp) disrupts its repressive but not its stimulatory activity. Guo et
al. (2000) concluded that their results provide molecular, genetic, and
biochemical evidence that negative regulators of transcription
elongation control key aspects of neuronal development.

182205	TITLE *182205 SEX HORMONE-BINDING GLOBULIN; SHBG
;;ANDROGEN-BINDING PROTEIN; ABP;;
TESTOSTERONE-BINDING BETA-GLOBULIN; TEBG
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a previously characterized liver cDNA as a probe, Gershagen et al.
(1989) isolated a liver-secreted plasma glycoprotein that binds sex
steroids. Screening of a human testis cDNA library resulted in the
isolation of 2 distinct cDNA forms. One was identical to the previously
characterized liver SHBG cDNA, thus suggesting that human SHBG and the
androgen-binding protein (ABP) produced by Sertoli cells are encoded by
the same gene. The second cDNA differed from the first by having exon 1
exchanged with a completely different sequence and exon 7 deleted.
Primer extension experiments showed that the alternatively spliced
transcript corresponding to the second cDNA is present in both liver and
testis. From the primary structure of the putative SHBG-gene-related
protein, Gershagen et al. (1989) deduced that the protein is very
different from SHBG and probably without steroid-binding activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

By Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA, Gershagen et al. (1989) found
evidence indicating that only 1 SHBG is present in the human haploid
genome. The gene has 8 exons.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, Berube et al. (1990) localized the SHBG gene
to chromosome 17p13-p12. By the study of intersubspecies backcrosses,
Joseph et al. (1991) found that Shbg is located on mouse chromosome 11
in close linkage to several neurologic mutations, one of which, Tr, is
associated with male sterility. The fact that ABP-SHBG is found
throughout the rat brain suggested that these mutations may represent a
defect in Shbg.

GENE FUNCTION

Testosterone in plasma is present in both bound and unbound form; only
the unbound hormone is biologically active and available to tissues.
About 66% of testosterone is bound to testosterone-binding beta-globulin
(TEBG), 31% to albumin, and 1.5% to transcortin; 2% is unbound. The
regulatory function of TEBG is said to be well illustrated by female
hirsutism; although many hirsute women have normal levels of total
plasma testosterone, nearly all have depressed levels of TEBG, resulting
in increased levels of unbound testosterone (Wenn et al., 1977; Raj et
al., 1978).

In mice expressing an 11-kb human SHBG transgene and in HepG2
hepatoblastoma cells, Selva et al. (2007) demonstrated that the
monosaccharides glucose and fructose reduced human SHBG production by
hepatocytes, irrespective of the presence of insulin, by downregulation
of hepatocyte nuclear factor-4A (HNF4A; 600281) and replacement of HNF4A
by COUP-TFI (NR2F1; 132890) at a cis-element within the human SHBG
promoter, coincident with repression of its transcriptional activity.
Dose-dependent reduction of HNF4A in HepG2 cells occurred in concert
with parallel increases in cellular palmitate levels and could be
mimicked by treatment with palmitoyl-CoA; inhibition of lipogenesis
prevented monosaccharide-induced downregulation of HNF4A and reduced
SHBG expression in HepG2 cells. Selva et al. (2007) concluded that
monosaccharide-induced lipogenesis reduces hepatic HNF4A levels, which
in turn attenuates SHBG expression, and noted that this provides a
biologic explanation for the sensitivity of SHBG as a biomarker of the
metabolic syndrome.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Cavalli-Sforza et al. (1977) developed an ingenious method for detection
of genetic variation in plasma proteins, namely, electrophoretic
screening after treatment with radioactive ligands such as vitamins,
hormones, metal ions and drugs. This is essentially a method of
'staining' the protein comparable to the methods using dyes. With this
approach they identified polymorphism of testosterone-binding
beta-globulin, as well as a possible silent allele. By polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (PAGE), Luckock and Cavalli-Sforza (1983) identified
4 electrophoretic variants, which they suggested result from
combinations of 3 alleles, designated N ('normal'), S ('slow'), and O
('absent'). The first 2 are codominant and the third recessive. The
frequencies of the 3 alleles in white Americans were, respectively,
0.68, 0.11, 0.21; in black Americans, 0.65, 0.14, 0.22; in Japanese
Americans, 0.59, 0.09, 0.32. Phenotype frequencies and segregation from
various crosses supported simple mendelian inheritance of an autosomal
gene.

By investigating neuraminidase-treated serum samples using isoelectric
focusing (IEF) followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes and
immunostaining, van Baelen et al. (1992) distinguished 3 patterns
consistent with the expression of a biallelic autosomal system. They
published data on allele frequencies in many populations and found
frequencies of the common allele (SHBG*1) varying from 0.848 in Chinese
to 0.985 in Balinese; monomorphism was found only in Australian
Aborigines, all 47 of whom were SHBG*1 homozygotes. Van Baelen et al.
(1992) found no significant difference for allele frequencies among
hirsute Belgian women. They also presented evidence that the subunit
produced by the SHBG*2 allele has a higher molecular mass than the one
produced by the SHBG*1 allele and that the 3 SHBG genotypes have
identical binding characteristics for 5-alpha-dihydrotestosterone.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Power et al. (1992) demonstrated in a Belgian patient homozygous for a
variant isoelectric focusing pattern that a point mutation was present
in exon 8, creating an additional site for N-linked glycosylation.
Expression studies showed that steroid binding was not affected. Hardy
et al. (1995) found the same mutation in Mexican subjects who were
heterozygous for the variant IEF phenotype. Denaturing gradient gel
electrophoresis (DGGE) was used to localize the mutation in these
subjects and to purify the variant allele for DNA sequence analysis. A
GAC-to-AAC transition in codon 327 caused an asp-to-asn substitution in
the protein (D327N). The site of the mutation does not lie within the
predicted steroid-binding site of the molecule. The finding in these
widely separated populations suggested that the SHBG gene is biallelic
worldwide. The polymorphism was not associated with any pathologic
condition.

Xita et al. (2003) investigated the possible association of the
functional (TAAAA)n polymorphism in the promoter of the SHBG gene
(Hogeveen et al., 2001) with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS; 184700)
and SHBG levels. They studied 185 women with PCOS and 324 normal
controls. Genotyping revealed 6 (TAAAA)n alleles containing 6 to 11
repeats. The distribution of these alleles was different in the 2
groups. Women with PCOS had a significantly greater frequency of longer
(TAAAA)n alleles (more than 8 repeats) than normal women who had shorter
alleles (fewer than 8 repeats) in higher frequency (P = 0.001). In the
PCOS group, carriers of the longer allele genotypes had lower SHBG
levels than those with shorter alleles. The authors concluded that SHBG
may be a susceptibility gene for PCOS and may provide the genetic link
for the developmental origin hypothesis for PCOS that was proposed on
the basis of experimental observations in prenatally androgenized sheep
and primates (Abbott et al., 2002).

In a population of 303 women referred for hirsutism, Cousin et al.
(2004) investigated the relationship between the D327N mutation in SHBG
exon 8, the pentanucleotide repeat polymorphism (TAAAA)n in the SHBG
5-prime untranslated region, and SHBG levels. The D327N mutant allele
was associated with higher SHBG levels than was the wildtype.
Multivariate analysis showed that BMI, PCOS status, and D327N
polymorphism influenced plasma SHBG concentrations, each of these
parameters contributing independently of the others. A strong
disequilibrium linkage was found between the D327N variant allele and an
allele with 8 TAAAA repeats (P less than 0.0001). The authors suggested
that this linkage disequilibrium could mask the effect of the TAAAA
repeat polymorphism on SHBG concentration in vivo. Nevertheless, SHBG
levels in patients who were homozygous for 6 repeats were significantly
(P = 0.043) higher than in 9-repeat homozygous patients and lay between
the two for 8-repeat homozygous patients. Results supported the notion
that polymorphism within the coding sequence and, potentially, in the
regulatory sequence of the SHBG gene is associated with circulating SHBG
levels and may represent part of the genetic background of sex steroid
hormone activity in humans.

For discussion of a possible association between variation in the SHBG
gene and type 2 diabetes, see 125853.

- SHBG Circulating Level Quantitative Trait Locus

Eriksson et al. (2006) studied whether either of 2 polymorphisms in the
SHBG gene promoter, a (TAAAA)n microsatellite and the SNP dbSNP
rs1799941, are associated with serum levels of SHBG (613498), sex
steroids, or bone mineral density (BMD) in men. In both cohorts,
(TAAAA)n and dbSNP rs1799941 genotypes were associated with serum levels
of SHBG (P less than 0.001), dihydrotestosterone (P less than 0.05), and
5-alpha-androstane-3-alpha,17-beta-diol glucuronides (P less than 0.05).
In the elderly men, they were also associated with testosterone and BMD
at all hip bone sites. Eriksson et al. (2006) concluded that
polymorphisms in the SHBG promoter predict serum levels of SHBG,
androgens, and glucuronidated androgen metabolites, and hip BMD in men.

In the NCI-Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium using 874 SNPs
in 37 candidate genes in the sex steroid hormone pathway, Ahn et al.
(2009) identified a G-A variant (dbSNP rs1799941) located 67 bp upstream
from the transcription start site of the SHBG gene associated with
increased mean circulating levels of SHBG in 4,720 Caucasian men (p =
4.52 x 10(-21); 26.9% increase in AA homozygotes versus wildtype
homozygotes). The relationship between dbSNP rs1799941 was consistent
across the 5 cohorts in the study, age, BMI, and case-control status.
Additionally, dbSNP rs1799941 was also strongly associated with
increased mean circulating levels of testosterone in 4,678 Caucasian men
(p = 7.54 x 10(-15); 14.3% increase in AA homozygotes versus wildtype
homozygotes). Since clearance and bioavailability of testosterone are
related to SHBG levels, Ahn et al. (2009) used regression analysis to
show that also tended to predict SHBG adjusted-testosterone levels (p =
1.33 x 10(-3)).

HISTORY

Gross and Horton (1971) presented evidence indicating 'dominant'
segregation of the trait and low testosterone-binding protein, and
suggested Y-linkage. Hecht and Kimberling (1971) pointed out that since
the Y chromosome represents only about 2% of the human male haploid
genome, Bayesian correction of the estimate of Y-linkage reduces the
value to 1 in 3.

300713	TITLE *300713 OTU DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 5; OTUD5
;;DUBA
DESCRIPTION Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs; see 603478) are proteases that
specifically cleave ubiquitin (191339) linkages, negating the action of
ubiquitin ligases. DUBA belongs to a DUB subfamily characterized by an
ovarian tumor (OTU) domain.

CLONING

Kayagaki et al. (2007) identified deubiquitinating enzyme A (DUBA) in a
small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based screen as a regulator of type I
interferon (e.g., 147660) production. In addition to an OTU domain, DUBA
contains a ubiquitin action motif (UIM) at its carboxy terminus. The
2,759-basepair mRNA contains an open reading frame (ORF) predicting a
571-amino acid protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Kayagaki et al. (2007) demonstrated that reduction of DUBA augmented the
pattern recognition receptor (PRR)-induced type I interferon response in
transfected HEK293 cells, whereas ectopic expression of DUBA had the
converse effect. DUBA bound tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated
factor-3 (TRAF3; 601896), an adaptor protein essential for type I
interferon response. TRAF3 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that preferentially
assembled lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains in cotransfection assays.
DUBA selectively cleaved the lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains on TRAF3,
resulting in its dissociation from the downstream signaling complex
containing TANK-binding kinase-1 (604834). A discrete ubiquitin
interaction motif within DUBA was required for efficient
deubiquitination of TRAF3 and optimal suppression of type I interferon.
Kayagaki et al. (2007) concluded that their data identified DUBA as a
negative regulator of innate immune responses.

MAPPING

The OTUD5 gene maps to chromosome Xp11.23 (Kayagaki et al., 2007).

614471	TITLE *614471 UBIQUITIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE 19; USP19
;;KIAA0891
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

USP19 is a ubiquitin protein ligase (EC 3.4.19.12) with a role in
regulating cell cycle progression (Lu et al., 2009).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned USP19, which they designated
KIAA0891. The deduced 1,371-amino acid protein shares significant
similarity with the ubiquitin protease UNPH (USP4; 603486). RT-PCR ELISA
detected highest expression in fetal liver, followed by adult spinal
cord. All other tissues, including adult and fetal brain, showed much
lower expression, and no expression was detected in spleen.

GENE FUNCTION

p27(KIP1) (CDKN1B; 600778) is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that
regulates the G1/S transition. Using rat myoblast and fibroblast cell
lines, Lu et al. (2009) showed that Usp19 regulated p27(KIP1) levels by
deubiquitinating and stabilizing Kpc1 (RNF123; 614472), an E3 ubiquitin
ligase that ubiquitinates cytosolic p27(KIP1) and targets it for
proteasomal degradation at G1 phase. Immunoprecipitation analysis
revealed that Usp19 interacted directly with Kpc1. Knockdown of Usp19
resulted in loss of Kpc1, accumulation of p27(KIP1), inhibition of cell
proliferation, and slower progression from G0/G1 to S phase.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the USP19 gene
to chromosome 3.

Hartz (2011) mapped the USP19 gene to chromosome 3p21.31 based on an
alignment of the USP19 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB020698) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;FE65-LIKE 1; FE65L1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The cytoplasmic domain of the Alzheimer disease locus amyloid protein
precursor (APP; 104760) binds 4 human phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB)
proteins; see APBA1 (602414). By use of a yeast 2-hybrid screening of a
human brain cDNA library, McLoughlin and Miller (1996) identified 3 of
these proteins: the human homolog of Fe65 (APBB1; 602709), an Fe65-like
sequence (APBB2), and an X11-like sequence (APBA2; 602712). From a human
fetal brain cDNA library, Guenette et al. (1996) also cloned APBB2 based
on its interaction with the carboxy terminus of APP. They showed that
the APBB2 protein interacts with another amyloid protein precursor,
APLP2 (104776), but not with APLP1 (104775). The APBB2 gene encodes a
730-amino acid polypeptide that is 51% identical to rat Fe65. Northern
blot analysis revealed that APBB2 has widespread expression in human
tissues.

MAPPING

By use of a radiation hybrid panel, Blanco et al. (1998) mapped the
human APBB2 gene to chromosome 4, between the markers D4S405 (4.6 cR)
and D4S496 (10.1 cR).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Since the APBB2 gene encodes a protein that is capable of binding to
amyloid beta precursor protein (APP), which is central to the
pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (104300), Li et al. (2005) performed a
genetic association study of APBB2 and late-onset Alzheimer disease
(104310) in 3 independently collected case-control series totaling
approximately 2,000 samples. They found that one SNP (dbSNP rs13133980),
located in a region conserved between the human and mouse genomes,
showed a significant interaction with age of disease onset. For this
marker, Li et al. (2005) reported the association with late-onset
Alzheimer disease was most pronounced in subjects with disease onset
before 75 years of age; odds ratio for homozygotes = 2.43 and for
heterozygotes = 2.15.

603083	TITLE *603083 HETEROGENEOUS NUCLEAR RIBOPROTEIN L; HNRNPL
;;HNRPL
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) complexes contain hnRNAs
and their associated proteins and are directly involved in mRNA
synthesis and maturation. hnRNP complexes contain more than 20 major
proteins, including the group A, B, and C core proteins and a more
heterogeneous population of larger polypeptides, such as HNRNPL
(Pinol-Roma et al., 1989).

CLONING

Pinol-Roma et al. (1989) noted that among the major polypeptides
associated with hnRNA in HeLa cells is a set of 2 distinct,
approximately 68-kD proteins, designated HNRPL and HNRPM (HNRPNM;
160994). By UV crosslinking proteins to RNA and by sedimentation
analysis before and after RNase digestion, Pinol-Roma et al. (1989)
demonstrated with a monoclonal antibody against HNRPL that HNRPL is
stably associated with hnRNP complexes. They also showed that HNRPL is
present in the nucleoplasm, in 1 to 3 unidentified discrete nonnucleolar
structures, and outside hnRNP complexes. The authors detected HNRPL in
various vertebrates and found that HNRPL is associated with most nascent
transcripts on the lampbrush chromosomes of the newt N. viridescens.
Pinol-Roma et al. (1989) screened a HeLa cell cDNA expression library
with serum containing antibodies against hnRNPs and isolated a cDNA
encoding HNRPL. Northern blot analysis detected an approximately 2.3-kb
HNRPL transcript in HeLa cells. The predicted 558-amino acid protein is
glycine- and proline-rich and has a calculated molecular weight of
60,187 Da. HNRPL contains 2 segments of approximately 80 amino acids
each that are weakly related to each other and to the ribonucleoprotein
consensus sequence-type RNA-binding domains of other hnRNP and snRNP
proteins.

GENE FUNCTION

Translational repression of glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1, or SLC2A1;
138140) in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; 137800) is mediated by a
specific RNA-binding protein that interacts with an AU-rich response
element in the 3-prime UTR of the GLUT1 transcript. Hamilton et al.
(1999) showed that HNRNPA2 (600124) and HNRNPL bound the 3-prime UTR of
GLUT1 mRNA. Induction of brain ischemia in rats or hypoglycemic stress
in 293 cells increased GLUT1 expression via mRNA stability. Polysomes
isolated from ischemic rat brains or hypoglycemic 293 cells showed loss
of HNRNPA2 and HNRNPL, suggesting that reduced levels of these
RNA-binding proteins results in GLUT1 mRNA stability.
Immunoprecipitation of polysomes from activated human T lymphocytes
suggested that HNRNPA2 and HNRNPL form a complex in vivo.

Ray et al. (2009) reported an RNA switch in the human VEGFA (192240)
mRNA 3-prime untranslated region (UTR) that integrates signals from
IFN-gamma (107570) and hypoxia to regulate VEGFA translation in myeloid
cells. Analogous to riboswitches, the VEGFA 3-prime UTR undergoes a
binary conformational change in response to environmental signals.
However, the VEGFA 3-prime UTR switch is metabolite-independent, and the
conformational change is dictated by mutually exclusive,
stimulus-dependent binding of proteins, namely, the IFN-gamma-activated
inhibitor of translation complex and HNRNPL. Ray et al. (2009)
speculated that the VEGFA switch represents the founding member of a
family of signal-mediated, protein-dependent RNA switches that evolved
to regulate gene expression in multicellular animals in which the
precise integration of disparate inputs may be more important than the
rapidity of response.

604296	TITLE *604296 GLYOXYLATE REDUCTASE/HYDROXYPYRUVATE REDUCTASE; GRHPR
;;GLXR
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Cramer et al. (1999) and Rumsby and Cregeen (1999) independently
identified a glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase (GRHPR; EC
1.1.1.79) cDNA clone from a human liver EST library. The GRHPR gene
encodes a predicted 328-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular
mass of 35.5 kD. By transient transfection of the cDNA clone into COS
cells, Cramer et al. (1999) verified that GRHPR encodes an enzyme with
hydroxypyruvate reductase, glyoxylate reductase, and D-glycerate
dehydrogenase enzymatic activities. Database analysis of human ESTs
revealed widespread tissue expression, indicating that the enzyme may
have a role in metabolism.

GENE STRUCTURE

Cramer et al. (1999) determined that the GRHPR gene contains 9 exons
spanning approximately 9 kb.

MAPPING

Using ESTs, Cramer et al. (1999) found that the GRHPR gene maps
pericentromeric on chromosome 9. Webster et al. (2000) presented
haplotype data indicating that the GRHPR gene is located near the marker
D9S1874.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 pairs of sibs from 2 unrelated families with type II hyperoxaluria
(260000), Cramer et al. (1999) identified a 1-bp deletion in the GRHPR
gene (103delG; 604296.0001) by SSCP analysis. All 4 patients were
homozygous for the same mutation.

Webster et al. (2000) identified 5 other mutations in patients with type
II hyperoxaluria. Ten of 11 patients that they had genotyped were
homozygous for 1 of the 6 known mutations. In the case of two-thirds of
the patients, the parents were related. Genotyping also showed the
possible presence of a founder effect for the 2 most common mutations:
103delG and arg99 to ter (604296.0002).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPEROXALURIA, PRIMARY, TYPE II
GRHPR, 1-BP DEL, 103G

In 2 pairs of sibs from 2 unrelated families with type II primary
hyperoxaluria (260000), Cramer et al. (1999) identified deletion of the
first nucleotide (G) of codon 35 (103G) of the GRHPR gene, resulting in
a frameshift beginning at codon 35 and predicted to result in a

HYPEROXALURIA, PRIMARY, TYPE II
GRHPR, ARG99TER

In 4 of 18 alleles of the GRHPR gene in patients with type II primary
hyperoxaluria (260000), Webster et al. (2000) found a 295C-T transition
causing a nonsense arg99-to-ter amino acid substitution.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

SNAP (see 603215) receptors, or SNAREs, determine the specificity of the
docking and fusion of vesicles to the correct target membranes. The S.
cerevisiae Sec22, Bet1 (605456), and Bos1 SNAREs are interacting
proteins that play a role in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi transport.
See GOSR2 (604027). By searching EST databases for sequences related to
rat SEC22A (612442), Tang et al. (1998) identified human cDNAs encoding
a protein that they designated SEC22C. Northern blot analysis revealed
that SEC22C is expressed ubiquitously as 1- and 5-kb mRNAs. The
predicted 250-amino acid SEC22C protein shares 36% and 19% sequence
identity with rat SEC22A and mouse Sec22b (604029), respectively. By
immunofluorescence of mammalian cells expressing epitope-tagged SEC22C,
Tang et al. (1998) found that SEC22C accumulated primarily at the ER. As
with Sec22b, overexpression of recombinant SEC22C protein disrupted the
localization of SNAREs involved in ER-Golgi transport, indicating that
SEC22C protein plays a role in ER-Golgi protein trafficking.

GENE FUNCTION

To fuse transport vesicles with target membranes, proteins of the SNARE
complex must be located on both the vesicle and the target membrane. In
yeast, 4 integral membrane proteins, Sed5, Bos1, Sec22, and Bet1 each
are believed to contribute a single helix to form the SNARE complex that
is needed for transport from endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi. This
generates a 4-helix bundle, which ultimately mediates the actual fusion
event. Parlati et al. (2000) explored how the anchoring arrangement of
the 4 helices affects their ability to mediate fusion. Parlati et al.
(2000) reconstituted 2 populations of phospholipid bilayer vesicles,
with the individual SNARE proteins distributed in all possible
combinations between them. Of the 8 nonredundant permutations of 4
subunits distributed over 2 vesicle populations, only 1 resulted in
membrane fusion. Fusion occurred only when the v-SNARE Bet1 is on 1
membrane and the syntaxin heavy chain Sed5 and its 2 light chains, Bos1
and Sec22, are on the other membrane, where they form a functional
t-SNARE. Thus, each SNARE protein is topologically restricted by design
to function either as a v-SNARE or as part of a t-SNARE complex.
