604751	TITLE *604751 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 266; ZNF266
;;HZF1
DESCRIPTION Zinc finger proteins have been shown to interact with nucleic acids and
to have diverse functions. The zinc finger domain is a conserved amino
acid sequence motif containing 2 specifically positioned cysteines and 2
histidines that are involved in coordinating zinc. Kruppel-related
proteins form 1 family of zinc finger proteins. See ZFP93 (604749) for
additional information on zinc finger proteins.

CLONING

By screening a human monoblast cell line (U-937) cDNA library with a
degenerate oligonucleotide based on a conserved region of
Kruppel-related zinc finger proteins that encompasses the H/C link,
Abrink et al. (1995) isolated cDNAs encoding 42 distinct Kruppel-related
zinc finger proteins, including ZNF266, which they called HZF1. The
partial ZNF266 cDNA, which lacks 5-prime coding sequence, encodes 7
C-terminal zinc finger domains. Northern blot analysis detected a major
4.5-kb ZNF266 transcript in HeLa cells, U-937 cells, and PMA-induced
U-937 cells, with higher expression in the monocyte/macrophage lineages.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the ZNF266
gene to chromosome 19 (TMAP A008Z15).

611589	TITLE *611589 PATATIN-LIKE PHOSPHOLIPASE DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 5; PNPLA5
;;GS2-LIKE PROTEIN; GS2L
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Human patatin-like phospholipases, such as PNPLA5, have been implicated
in regulation of adipocyte differentiation and have been induced by
metabolic stimuli (Wilson et al., 2006).

CLONING

By database analysis, followed by screening of human EST databases,
Wilson et al. (2006) identified PNPLA5, which encodes a 429-amino acid
protein containing a patatin-like domain and 2 glycosaminoglycan sites.
Structural analysis determined that the patatin-like domain was composed
of a beta-sheet sandwiched by alpha-helices in approximately 3 layers.
Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that PNPLA5 was expressed at
moderate levels in brain and at very low levels in liver.

GENE FUNCTION

Gao and Simon (2007) measured retinol transacylation activity and found
that PNPLA5 appeared to inhibit transacylation catalyzed by endogenous
enzymes, but it had measurable retinylester hydrolysis activity.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PNPLA5
gene to chromosome 22 (TMAP G65439).
