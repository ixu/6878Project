CLONING

To identify protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) involved in the
oncogenic process leading to the development of pancreatic carcinoma,
Wang et al. (1996) performed PCR on pooled poly(A)+ RNA from 9 human
pancreatic carcinoma cell lines using PTPase consensus oligonucleotide
primers. One of the novel PCR products recovered was termed PCP2 and was
used to screen a human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cDNA library. The full
sequence of PCP2 predicts a 1,430 amino acid protein consisting of a
putative extracellular domain of 740 amino acids, a single transmembrane
domain, and an intracellular domain of 666 amino acids. The
intracellular region contains 2 tandemly repeated PTP catalytic domains
with a high degree of identity to the catalytic domains of mouse
PTP-kappa and PTP-mu. In addition to a signal peptide and 13 potential
N-linked glycosylation sites, the extracellular domain contains a MAM
(meprin/A5/PTP-mu) domain followed by 1 Ig-like repeat and 4 putative
fibronectin type III repeats. The MAM domain, found in Xenopus A5
glycoprotein, meprin A, and meprin B, as well as in PTP-kappa and
PTP-mu, may be involved in attachment to the cytoskeleton. PCP2,
PTP-kappa, and PTP-mu appear to form a subfamily of MAM-containing
receptor-like PTPs (RPTPs). PCP2 also contains the tripeptide HAV,
implicated in cell-cell contact in the cadherins. By Northern blot
analysis, Wang et al. (1996) demonstrated that the 5.5-kb PCP2
transcript is widely distributed at varying levels, with very high
expression in brain, skeletal muscle, and pancreas, but no expression in
placenta or spleen. Subcellular localization using laser scanning
immunofluorescence microscopy showed localization of PCP2 at
intercellular adhesions and colocalization with beta-catenin and
E-cadherin. Wang et al. (1996) hypothesized that PCP2 and other members
of this subfamily of RPTPases may function as cell contact receptors
that mediate and control cell-cell signals.

Wang et al. (1997) used degenerate PCR to clone PTPJ, a member of the
type II receptor PTPase family. The PTPJ cDNA encodes a 1,436-amino acid
polypeptide that includes a single transmembrane domain and a
cytoplasmic domain containing 2 tandemly repeated PTP catalytic domains.
The presence of 2 PTP domains indicates that this gene is a member of
the type II receptor PTPases. Northern blot analysis detected expression
in skeletal muscle, heart, prostate, pancreas, and placenta.

GENE FUNCTION

Wang et al. (1996) showed that PCP2 had tyrosine phosphatase activity
using an in vitro pNPP assay.

Wang et al. (1997) found that in lymphocytes or lymphoma cells,
expression of PTPJ was downregulated following stimulation by either
phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or calcium ionophore, suggesting that
PMA or calcium signaling pathways may be involved in regulating the
expression of PTPJ.

MAPPING

Gross (2011) mapped the PTPRU gene to chromosome 1p35.3 based on an
alignment of the PTPRU sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB208855) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;YY1-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; YAP;;
HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 2; HCCA2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By differential display PCR of normal hepatic tissue and hepatocellular
carcinomas, followed by screening a placenta cDNA library, Wang et al.
(2001) cloned YY1AP1, which they called HCCA2. The deduced 467-amino
acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 50.65 kD. HCCA2 contains
2 SH3-binding domains, 2 N-glycosylation sites, 6 N-myristoylation
sites, and numerous phosphorylation sites, but it does not have a
transmembrane domain, signal peptide, or targeting sequences. Northern
blot analysis detected 1.8- and 2.5-kb transcripts in all adult tissues
examined except liver. Expression was also detected in fetal liver,
lung, brain, and spleen. Western blot analysis of transfected embryonic
kidney fibroblasts detected HCCA2 at an apparent molecular mass of about
50 kD. Immunohistochemical staining showed that HCCA2 protein was
localized in the cytoplasm of liver cancer tissues, and it was not found
in surrounding nontumor hepatocytes.

Kuryshev et al. (2006) determined that YY1AP1 was formed by fusion of
the 5-prime region of the ASH1L gene (607999) and the 3-prime region of
the GON4L gene (610393) during a tandem segmental duplication on
chromosome 1. YY1AP1 contains the partial promoter and untranslated
first exon of ASH1L and coding exons 13 to 21 of GON4L. The 3-prime
region of YY1AP1 originated from a long terminal repeat of an endogenous
retrovirus, known as the MER51A repeat, that was inserted into exon 21
of GON4L after the duplication. The deduced YY1AP1 protein contains 750
amino acids, 748 of which correspond to amino acids 590 to 1,337 of the
GON4L protein. The last 2 C-terminal residues of YY1AP1 come from the
long terminal repeat of MER51A. RT-PCR detected ubiquitous expression of
YY1AP1, with highest levels in testis and skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Wang et al. (2001) determined that HCCA2 was not expressed in normal
adult liver tissue, but it was expressed in 79% of hepatocellular
carcinomas tested. HCCA2 expression was associated with invasion of the
tumor capsule.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Kuryshev et al. (2006) mapped the YY1AP1
gene to chromosome 1q22.
