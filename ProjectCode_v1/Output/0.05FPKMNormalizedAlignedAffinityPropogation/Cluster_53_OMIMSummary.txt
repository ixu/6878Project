DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By EST database searching for mammalian Crumbs family members (see CRB1,
604210), Makarova et al. (2003) identified and subsequently cloned CRB3
from human retina cDNA. The CRB3 cDNA encodes a deduced 120-amino acid
protein with a putative signal peptide in the first 20 amino acids, a
putative extracellular N-glycosylation site, and a transmembrane domain.
The intracellular domain contains a conserved band-4.1
superfamily-binding site and a Pals PDZ domain-binding site, as found in
Drosophila Crumbs and human CRB1. Makarova et al. (2003) also identified
mouse Crb3. The intracellular domains of the human and mouse proteins
are highly conserved. Using RT-PCR, Makarova et al. (2003) found high
levels of CRB3 mRNA in lung, kidney, retina, colon, and mammary gland,
and moderate levels in liver, spleen, pancreas, placenta, and prostate.
By Northern blot analysis of multiple human tissues, Lemmers et al.
(2004) demonstrated CRB3 expression in all epithelial tissues analyzed
and in skeletal muscle, with weak expression in brain.

GENE FUNCTION

From immunoprecipitation assays carried out with Madin Darby canine
kidney (MDCK) cell lysates, Makarova et al. (2003) showed that CRB3
binds with PALS1 (MMP5; 606958) and the PALS1-associated tight junction
protein, PATJ (see 603199). The PALS1 PDZ domain was found to be
necessary for CRB3 binding. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that
CRB3 is N-glycosylated. Makarova et al. (2003) demonstrated that CRB3 is
localized to the apical surface and tight junctions of MDCK cells and
that this localization is not dependent on glycosylation.

Lemmers et al. (2004) demonstrated that the apical localization of CRB3
is not dependent on the PDZ-binding domain (ERLI). Lemmers et al. (2004)
found that expression of CRB3 or of a chimera containing the
extracellular domain of the neurotrophin receptor p75NTR (NGFR; 162010)
and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of CRB3 led to a slower
development of functional tight junctions in MDCK cells. This phenotype
relied on the presence of the CRB3 PDZ-binding domain, which is involved
in a direct interaction with PAR6-alpha (PARD6A; 607484), a regulator of
epithelial polarity and tight junction formation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lemmers et al. (2004) determined that the CRB3 gene contains 4 exons,
with the last exon containing the 3-prime untranslated region.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the CRB3
gene to chromosome 19 (TMAP STS-N23258).

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Peshavaria and Day (1991) determined that the ENO3 gene encodes a
deduced 433-amino acid protein.

MAPPING

Chen and Giblett (1976) and Pearce et al. (1976) presented evidence for
3 enolase loci. By in situ hybridization studies using a probe for ENO2
(131360), Craig et al. (1989) found small aggregates of grains at
1pter-p36, the site of ENO1 (172430), and some at 17pter-p12.

Feo et al. (1990) mapped the muscle-specific beta-enolase (ENO3) to
chromosome 17pter-p11 by analysis of rodent-human somatic cell hybrids
and transfectant cell lines carrying different portions of chromosome
17. This muscle-specific enzyme maps to the region encoding the gene
cluster for the sarcomeric myosin heavy chains (MYH1; 160730).

GENE STRUCTURE

Peshavaria and Day (1991) determined that the ENO3 gene contains 12
exons and spans approximately 6 kb.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a man with glycogen storage disease XIII (GSD13; 612932), Comi et al.
(2001) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the ENO3
gene (G156D, 131370.0001; G374E, 131370.0002). Immunohistochemistry and
immunoblotting detected dramatically reduced beta-enolase protein in
this patient, while alpha-enolase was normally represented.

In a 47-year-old man with adult onset of exercise-induced myalgias,
generalized muscle weakness, and fatigability (612932), Comi et al.
(2001) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the ENO3
gene: a 467G-A transition resulting in a gly156-to-asp (G156D)
substitution and a 1121G-A transition resulting in a gly374-to-glu
(G374E; 131370.0002) substitution.
