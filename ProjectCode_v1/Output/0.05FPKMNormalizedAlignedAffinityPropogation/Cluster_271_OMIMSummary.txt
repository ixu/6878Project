;;K35
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

To identify human protein kinases with a role in cell cycle control,
Schultz and Nigg (1993) performed PCR with degenerate oligonucleotides
based on conserved motifs in the catalytic domain of the Aspergillus
nidulans NIMA protein kinase. They isolated 41 distinct promyelocytic
leukemia cell line cDNAs, including 1 partial cDNA designated K35.
Tassan et al. (1995) noted that K35 appears to be structurally related
to cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). By screening a human testis cDNA
library with K35, they isolated cDNAs corresponding to the entire coding
region of CDK8. The predicted 464-amino acid protein contains the
sequence motifs and 11 subdomains characteristic of a
serine/threonine-specific kinase. The protein sequence of CDK8 shares
48% identity over subdomains III to XI with the S. cerevisiae CDK SRB10,
and the 2 proteins have several common features. CDK8 migrated as a
53-kD protein on Western blots of HeLa cell extracts.

GENE FUNCTION

Cyclins are positive regulatory subunits of CDKs. In S. cerevisiae, the
CDK SRB10, a homolog of CDK8, interacts with SRB11, a cyclin related to
mammalian cyclin C (CCNC; 123838). The SRB10-SRB11 complex is part of
the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme and acts as a regulator of
transcription. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments by Tassan et al. (1995)
demonstrated that CDK8 interacted with cyclin C both in vitro and in
vivo. Tassan et al. (1995) proposed that CDK8-cyclin C might be
functionally associated with the mammalian transcription apparatus.

Mammalian CDK8 and cyclin C are components of the RNA polymerase II
holoenzyme complex, where they function as a protein kinase that
phosphorylates the C-terminal domain of the largest subunit of RNA
polymerase II. The CDK8/cyclin C protein complex is also found in a
number of mammalian Mediator-like protein complexes, which repress
activated transcription independently of the C-terminal domain in vitro.
Akoulitchev et al. (2000) demonstrated that CDK8/cyclin C can regulate
transcription by targeting the CDK7 (601955)/cyclin H (601953) subunits
of the general transcription initiation factor IIH (189972). CDK8
phosphorylates mammalian cyclin H at serine 5 and serine 304 both in
vitro and in vivo, in the vicinity of its functionally unique N- and
C-terminal alpha-helical domains. This phosphorylation represses both
the ability of TFIIH to activate transcription and its C-terminal kinase
activity. In addition, mimicking CDK8 phosphorylation of cyclin H in
vivo has a dominant-negative effect on cell growth. Akoulitchev et al.
(2000) concluded that their results linked the Mediator complex and the
basal transcription machinery by a regulatory pathway involving 2
cyclin-dependent kinases. This pathway appears to be unique to higher
organisms.

p21 (CDKN1A; 116899) is a key mediator of p53 (TP53; 191170)-dependent
cell cycle arrest. Donner et al. (2007) found that transcriptional
activity of the p21 promoter in human cell lines varied in response to
distinct p53-activating stimuli. Core Mediator subunits MED1 (PPARBP;
604311) and MED17 (603810) were recruited to the p21 gene regardless of
the p53-activating stimuli used. In contrast, 3 subunits of the CDK
module of Mediator, CDK8, MED12 (300188), and cyclin C, were recruited
following treatment with nutlin-3, a nongenotoxic drug that activates
p53, but not in response to DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light C.
CDK8 recruitment was also observed during p53-dependent activation of
the HDM2 gene (MDM2; 164785), and the levels of CDK8 occupancy at p53
target genes correlated positively with their transcriptional
activities. RNA interference experiments demonstrated that CDK8
functioned as a positive regulator of p21 and HDM2 transcription.

To identify genes that both modulate beta-catenin (see 116806) activity
and are essential for colon cancer cell proliferation, Firestein et al.
(2008) conducted 2 loss-of-function screens in human colon cancer cells
and compared genes identified in these screens with an analysis of copy
number alterations in colon cancer specimens. One of these genes, CDK8,
which encodes a member of the mediator complex, is located at 13q12.13,
a region of recurrent copy number gain in a substantial fraction of
colon cancers. Firestein et al. (2008) showed that suppression of CDK8
expression inhibits proliferation in colon cancer cells characterized by
high levels of CDK8 and beta-catenin hyperactivity. CDK8 kinase activity
was necessary for beta-catenin-driven transformation and for expression
of several beta-catenin transcriptional targets.

Morris et al. (2008) demonstrated that the transcription factor E2F1
(189971) is a potent and specific inhibitor of beta-catenin/T cell
factor (TCF)-dependent transcription and that this function contributes
to E2F1-induced apoptosis. E2F1 deregulation suppresses beta-catenin
activity in an adenomatous polyposis coli (APC; 611731)/glycogen
synthase kinase-3 (GSK3; see 606784)-independent manner, reducing the
expression of key beta-catenin targets including c-MYC (190080). This
interaction explains why colorectal tumors, which depend on beta-catenin
transcription for their abnormal proliferation, keep RB1 (614041)
intact. Remarkably, E2F1 activity is also repressed by CDK8, a
colorectal oncoprotein. Elevated levels of CDK8 protect
beta-catenin/TCF-dependent transcription from inhibition by E2F1. Morris
et al. (2008) concluded that thus, by retaining RB1 and amplifying CDK8,
colorectal tumor cells select conditions that collectively suppress E2F1
and enhance the activity of beta-catenin.

Kapoor et al. (2010) reported that the histone variant macroH2A (mH2A;
610054) suppresses tumor progression of malignant melanoma. Loss of mH2A
isoforms, histone variants generally associated with condensed chromatin
and fine-tuning of developmental gene expression programs, was
positively correlated with increasing malignant phenotype of melanoma
cells in culture and human tissue samples. Knockdown of mH2A isoforms in
melanoma cells of low malignancy resulted in significantly increased
proliferation and migration in vitro and growth and metastasis in vivo.
Restored expression of mH2A isoforms rescued these malignant phenotypes
in vitro and in vivo. Kapoor et al. (2010) demonstrated that the
tumor-promoting function of mH2A loss is mediated, at least in part,
through direct transcriptional upregulation of CDK8. Suppression of
CDK8, a colorectal cancer oncogene, inhibits proliferation of melanoma
cells, and knockdown of CDK8 in cells depleted of mH2A suppresses the
proliferative advantage induced by mH2A loss. Moreover, a significant
inverse correlation between mH2A and CDK8 expression levels exists in
melanoma patient samples. Kapoor et al. (2010) concluded that mH2A is a
critical component of chromatin that suppresses the development of
malignant melanoma.
