613746	TITLE *613746 BREAST CANCER ANTIESTROGEN RESISTANCE 4; BCAR4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for genes involved in antiestrogen resistance in breast
cancer, Godinho et al. (2010) identified BCAR4. The deduced BCAR4
protein contains 2 transmembrane domains.

GENE FUNCTION

Godinho et al. (2010) found that upregulation of BCAR4 mRNA in breast
cancer was associated with unfavorable response to tamoxifen treatment
and poor survival. Transfection of BCAR4 into ZR-75-1 breast cancer
cells increased the phosphorylation of ERBB2 (164870) and ERBB3
(190151), resulting in activation of AKT (see 164730) and ERK1 (MAPK3;
601795)/ERK2 (MAPK1; 176948). Knockdown of ERBB2, ERBB3, or ERBB4
(600543) via small interfering RNA inhibited proliferation in
BCAR4-overexpressing cells in the presence of 4-hydroxytamoxifen or
estradiol.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the BCAR4 gene to chromosome 16p13.13 based on an
alignment of the BCAR4 sequence (GenBank GENBANK CR606007) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).
