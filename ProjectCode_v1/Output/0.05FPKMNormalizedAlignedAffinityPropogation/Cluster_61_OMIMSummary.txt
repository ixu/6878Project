;;IRON-SULFUR PROTEIN REQUIRED FOR NADH DEHYDROGENASE; IND1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Respiratory complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase; EC 1.6.5.3) is a
large mitochondrial inner membrane enzyme consisting of 45 subunits and
8 iron-sulfur (Fe/S) clusters. NUBPL, or IND1, is an Fe/S protein that
plays a critical role in the assembly of respiratory complex I, likely
by transferring Fe/S into the Fe/S-containing complex I subunits
(Sheftel et al., 2009).

CLONING

By searching a human genome database for sequences similar to Ind1 of
lower organisms, Sheftel et al. (2009) identified NUBPL, which they
called IND1. They obtained a full-length clone by PCR. The deduced
protein contains an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence, a
highly conserved nucleotide-binding domain, and a putative Fe/S-binding
signature (CxxC). Western blot analysis of various human tissues
revealed highest IND1 expression in liver and kidney, with lower
expression in small intestine and brain. Fluorescence-tagged IND1
localized to the mitochondria of transfected HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Sheftel et al. (2009) showed that recombinant human IND1 could assemble
[4Fe-4S] clusters in vitro under anaerobic conditions. Immunoelectron
microscopy revealed that knockdown of IND1 in HeLa cells via short
hairpin RNA resulted in ultrastructural changes in mitochondria,
including loss of crista membranes, massive remodeling of the
respiratory supercomplexes, and increased lactate production, likely due
to defective respiratory chain activity. IND1 depletion resulted in
massive losses in several subunits of the peripheral arm of complex I,
with the concomitant appearance of a 450-kD subcomplex representing part
of the membrane arm. Mutation of the conserved cysteine residues at
position 244 and 247 resulted in an IND1 protein unable to function in
complex I assembly. Sheftel et al. (2009) concluded that IND1
participates in respiratory chain complex I assembly by providing Fe/S
clusters to complex I subunits.

GENE STRUCTURE

Calvo et al. (2010) detected 11 exons in the NUBPL gene.

MAPPING

Hartz (2010) mapped the NUBPL gene to chromosome 14q12 based on an
alignment of the NUBPL sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK022722) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a patient with mitochondrial complex I deficiency (252010), Calvo et
al. (2010) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
NUBPL gene (613621.0001 and 613621.0002).

In 6 patients from 5 unrelated families with complex I deficiency and a
characteristic leukoencephalopathic pattern on brain MRI, Kevelam et al.
(2013) identified biallelic mutations in the NUBPL gene (613621.0001;
613621.0003-613621.0006). All patients carried at least 1 copy of a
complex allele (G56R/c.815-27T-C; 613621.0001). The first mutations were
identified by whole-exome sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing.
All patients had a characteristic leukoencephalopathic pattern on brain
MRI. Initial studies showed confluent or multifocal cerebral white
matter lesions, predominantly affecting the deep white matter while
sparing the U-fibers and internal and external capsules. There were also
signal abnormalities and swelling of the corpus callosum. Signal
abnormalities were present in the cerebellar cortex, but not in the deep
white matter. Later imaging of most patients showed improvement of the
cerebral white matter and corpus callosum abnormalities, but worsening
of the cerebellar abnormalities and additional brainstem abnormalities.
All patients developed motor problems due to ataxia in the first years
of life, but other features were somewhat variable: some patients showed
continuous regression and others showed episodic regression. Five
patients had spasticity and only 2 achieved unsupported walking.
Cognitive capabilities varied between normal and significantly
deficient. Complex I deficiency ranged between 27 and 83% of normal, and
there was no correlation between residual complex I activity and
clinical severity.

MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX I DEFICIENCY
NUBPL, GLY56ARG AND 815-27T-C

In a patient with mitochondrial complex I deficiency (252010), Calvo et
al. (2010) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 alleles of the NUBPL
gene. One allele, inherited from the patient's father, carried a
c.166G-A transition in exon 2, resulting in a gly56-to-arg (G56R)
substitution, and a c.815-27T-C transition that was predicted to ablate
a consensus branch sequence and resulted in the skipping of exon 10. The
exon-skipping mutation was found in 2 of 232 control chromosomes from
persons of European ancestry. The second allele, inherited from the
patient's mother, carried a complex rearrangement interrupting NUBPL,
including a 240-kb deletion spanning exons 1 through 4 and a 130-kb
duplication involving exon 7 (613621.0002). The patient reported by
Calvo et al. (2010) presented at 2 years of age with developmental
delay, particularly of motor skills. He never achieved independent
walking. He developed myopathy, nystagmus, ataxia, upper motor neuron
signs, and absence seizures. Brain MRI showed leukodystrophy with
involvement of the cerebellar cortex and deep white matter. At age 8, he
had spasticity, ataxia, and speech problems. Patient fibroblasts had
only 19% residual complex I activity on spectrophometric enzyme assay
and 40% residual activity using dipstick assay. Transduction of patient
fibroblasts with wildtype NUBPL restored complex I activity.

By RT-PCR analysis, Tucker et al. (2012) demonstrated that the
c.815-27T-C mutation caused aberrant splicing and the generation of 3
NUBPL transcripts, 2 of which resulted in a frameshift: gly272valfsX11
and asp273glnfsX31; the former transcript was subject to
nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The third band represented some wildtype
transcript. Cells from the patient reported by Calvo et al. (2010) had
only 15% wildtype transcript and no detectable protein, whereas cells
from a control who carried a heterozygous c.815-27T-C mutation had 59%
protein expression. These findings indicated that the splice site
mutation results in reduced NUBPL mRNA and protein expression. In
addition, in vitro studies showed that the G56R protein had normal
mitochondrial import and processing, was stable, and restored complex I
activity in NUBPL-deficient cells. Tucker et al. (2012) concluded that
the splice site mutation, although present in controls, is likely
pathogenic, and that the G56R variant is unlikely to be pathogenic.
However, it remained possible that the 2 variants act together to impair
protein function when inherited on the same allele. The authors
emphasized the importance of functional studies to assess the
pathogenicity of identified variants.

Kevelam et al. (2013) identified the c.815-27T-C/R56G allele in 6
patients from 5 unrelated families with complex I deficiency and a
characteristic leukoencephalopathic pattern on brain MRI. One patient
from Argentina carried the complex allele in homozygous state, whereas
the other patients were compound heterozygous for this allele and
another presumably pathogenic variant in the NUBPL gene on the other
allele (613621.0003-613621.0006). The splice site variant was found in 1
of 60 controls.

Tucker et al. (2012) determined that the deletion/duplication identified
by Calvo et al. (2010) was a complex unbalanced inversion between
regions of repetitive elements that most likely occurred during
replication.

NUBPL, 10-BP INS, NT667

In a German patient with mitochondrial complex I deficiency (252010) and
a characteristic leukoencephalopathic pattern on brain MRI, Kevelam et
al. (2013) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
NUBPL gene: a 10-bp insertion (c.667_668insCCTTGTGCTG) in exon 8,
resulting in premature termination (Glu223AlafsTer4), and 613621.0001.
The insertion mutation was not found in several large control databases.

MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX I DEFICIENCY
NUBPL, ASP105TYR

In 2 Canadian sibs with mitochondrial complex I deficiency (252010) and
a characteristic leukoencephalopathic pattern on brain MRI, Kevelam et
al. (2013) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
NUBPL gene: a 313G-T transversion in exon 4, resulting in an
asp105-to-tyr (D105Y) substitution at a conserved residue, and
613621.0001. The D105Y mutation was not found in several large control
databases. Patient fibroblasts showed decreased NUBPL and decreased
amounts of assembled complex I associated with a 50 to 60% reduction in
complex I activity compared to controls.

NUBPL, IVS8DS, G-A, +1

In a patient from the United States with mitochondrial complex I
deficiency (252010) and a characteristic leukoencephalopathic pattern on
brain MRI, Kevelam et al. (2013) identified compound heterozygosity for
2 mutations in the NUBPL gene: a G-to-A transition in intron 8
(c.693+1G-A), predicted to result in the skipping of exon 8, and
613621.0001. The splice site mutation was not found in several large
control databases.

NUBPL, LEU193PHE

In a patient from the Netherlands with mitochondrial complex I
deficiency (252010) and a characteristic leukoencephalopathic pattern on
brain MRI, Kevelam et al. (2013) identified compound heterozygosity for
2 mutations in the NUBPL gene: a c.579A-C transversion in exon 7,
resulting in a leu193-to-phe (L193F) substitution, and 613621.0001. The
L193F mutation was not found in several large control databases.

604037	TITLE *604037 RAS-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN RAB5C; RAB5C
;;RAB-LIKE, FORMERLY; RABL, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the Rab protein family are small GTPases of the Ras
superfamily that are thought to ensure fidelity in the process of
docking and/or fusion of vesicles with their correct acceptor
compartment (Han et al., 1996).

CLONING

Han et al. (1996) isolated fetal lung cDNAs encoding a RAB protein that
they designated RABL (RAB5-like). The predicted 216-amino acid RABL
protein shares 86% identity with RAB5A (179512) and RAB5B (179514) and
contains the conserved GTP-binding site characteristic of RAS proteins.
RT-PCR analysis revealed that RABL is expressed ubiquitously.

MAPPING

By analysis of cloned segments, Albertsen et al. (1994) determined that
the RAB5C gene, which they called BC1-16, is located in the BRCA1
(113705) gene region on chromosome 17q12-q21. Han et al. (1996) refined
the map position to 17q21.2 using FISH.

120353	TITLE *120353 MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASE 1; MMP1
;;COLLAGENASE, FIBROBLAST; CLG; CLGN;;
COLLAGENASE, INTERSTITIAL
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Matrix metalloproteinases are zinc-dependent proteases that degrade
extracellular matrix proteins. MMP1 is also known as collagenase (EC
3.4.23.7) (Nagase et al., 1992).

CLONING

Brinckerhoff et al. (1987) identified a cDNA clone of human collagenase.
The clone identified a single collagenase gene of about 17 kb from blots
of human genomic DNA. Restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequence data
indicated that the cDNA clone was full length and that it was identical
to that described for human skin fibroblast collagenase. Collagenase is
the only enzyme able to initiate breakdown of the interstitial
collagens, types I, II, and III. The fact that the collagens are the
most abundant proteins in the body means that collagenase plays a key
role in the remodeling that occurs constantly in both normal and
diseased conditions. The identity of human skin and synovial cell
collagenase and the ubiquity of this enzyme and of its substrates,
collagens I, II, and III, imply that the common mechanism controlling
collagenolysis throughout the body may be operative in both normal and
disease states.

MAPPING

Gerhard et al. (1987) confirmed the assignment of the collagenase gene
to chromosome 11 by the use of a DNA probe for Southern analysis of
somatic cell hybrids. Analysis of cell lines with rearrangements
involving chromosome 11 indicated that the gene is in the region
11q11-q23. Church et al. (1983) had used somatic cell hybrids between
mouse cells and human normal skin and corneal fibroblasts and recessive
dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB; 226600) skin fibroblasts to
assign the human structural gene for collagenase to chromosome 11.
Production of collagenase was measured by a specific radioimmunoassay.
It appeared that both the normal and the RDEB collagenase gene mapped to
chromosome 11. This was earlier taken to indicate that the abnormal
collagenase produced by RDEB cells represented a mutation of the
structural gene. Later work indicated that both the autosomal dominant
(131750) and autosomal recessive forms of dystrophic epidermolysis
bullosa are due to mutations in the type VII collagen gene (COL7A1;
120120). The excessive formation of collagenase must represent a
secondary phenomenon, not the primary defect. It should be noted that
fibroblasts from patients with the Werner syndrome (277700) also express
high constitutive levels of collagenase in vitro (Bauer et al., 1986).

Pendas et al. (1996) isolated a 1.5-Mb YAC clone mapping to 11q22.
Detailed analysis of this nonchimeric YAC clone ordered 7 MMP genes as
follows: cen--MMP8 (120355)--MMP10 (185260)--MMP1--MMP3 (185250)--MMP12
(601046)--MMP7 (178990)--MMP13 (600108)--tel.

GENE FUNCTION

Maymon et al. (2000) measured levels of MMP1 in amniotic fluid from 353
women, including those with intact membranes, in term or preterm labor
or not in labor, and those with term and premature rupture of the
membranes (610504), with or without microbial invasion of the amniotic
cavity. MMP1 was detectable in 81.3% (287 of 353) amniotic fluid
samples, and the concentration increased with increasing gestational
age. Analysis of the matrix metalloproteinase profile of amniotic fluid
in term and preterm rupture of membranes showed that patterns were
similar for every enzyme except MMP1 and MMP8 (120355), suggesting
different molecular pathophysiologic mechanisms for extracellular matrix
degradation of rupture of membranes in term and preterm gestations.
Maymon et al. (2000) concluded that MMP1 is implicated in the mechanisms
of membrane rupture.

Lahmann et al. (2001) found significantly more MMP1 mRNA in the buttock
skin of smokers than nonsmokers and suggested that smoking-induced MMP1
might be important in the skin-aging effects of tobacco smoking.

Saffarian et al. (2004) showed that activated collagenase (MMP1) moves
processively on the collagen fibril. The mechanism of movement is a
biased diffusion with the bias component dependent on the proteolysis of
its substrate, not ATP hydrolysis. Inactivation of the enzyme by a
single amino acid residue substitution in the active center eliminated
the bias without noticeable effect on rate of diffusion. Monte Carlo
simulations using a model similar to a 'burnt bridge' Brownian ratchet
accurately described the experimental result and previous observations
on kinetics of collagen digestion. Saffarian et al. (2004) concluded
that the biologic implications of MMP1 acting as a molecular ratchet
tethered to the cell surface suggested novel mechanisms for its role in
tissue remodeling and cell-matrix interaction.

Boire et al. (2005) found that expression of PAR1 (F2R; 187930) was both
required and sufficient to promote growth and invasion of breast
carcinoma cells in a xenograft mouse model. MMP1 acted as a protease
agonist of PAR1, cleaving the receptor at the proper site to generate
PAR1-dependent Ca(2+) signals and migration. MMP1 activity was derived
from fibroblasts and was absent from the breast cancer cells. These
results demonstrated that MMP1 in the stromal-tumor microenvironment can
alter the behavior of cancer cells through PAR1 to promote cell
migration and invasion.

By in vivo selection, transcriptomic analysis, functional verification,
and clinical validation, Minn et al. (2005) identified a set of genes
that marks and mediates breast cancer metastasis to the lungs. Some of
these genes serve dual functions, providing growth advantages both in
the primary tumor and in the lung microenvironment. Others contribute to
aggressive growth selectivity in the lung. Among the lung metastasis
signature genes identified, several, including MMP1 (p less than
0.000001), were functionally validated. Two that were not functionally
validated but that achieved the highest statistical significance (p less
than 0.000001) were FSCN1 (602689) and angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4;
605910). Those subjects expressing the lung metastasis signature had a
significantly poorer lung metastasis-free survival, but not bone
metastasis-free survival, compared to subjects without the signature.

Metastasis entails numerous biologic functions that collectively enable
cancerous cells from a primary site to disseminate and overtake distant
organs. Using genetic and pharmacologic approaches, Gupta et al. (2007)
showed that the epidermal growth factor receptor ligand epiregulin
(602061), the cyclooxygenase COX2 (600262), and the matrix
metalloproteinases MMP1 and MMP2 (120360), when expressed in human
breast cancer cells, collectively facilitate the assembly of new tumor
blood vessels, the release of tumor cells into the circulation, and the
breaching of lung capillaries by circulating tumor cells to seed
pulmonary metastasis. Gupta et al. (2007) concluded that their findings
revealed how aggressive primary tumorigenic functions can be
mechanistically coupled to greater lung metastatic potential, and how
such biologic activities can be therapeutically targeted with specific
drug combinations.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Joos et al. (2002) found an association between a 1-bp insertion in the
MMP1 gene (G-1607GG; dbSNP rs1799750; 120353.0001) and the rate of
decline of lung function in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD;
606963).

Fujimoto et al. (2002) analyzed the G-1607GG promoter polymorphism in
the MMP1 gene in 75 African American infants who were born after preterm
premature rupture of the membranes (PPROM; 610504) and 235 controls, and
found a significant association between fetal carriage of a 2G allele
and PPROM (OR = 2.29; p = 0.028).

In studies in amnion fibroblasts, Wang et al. (2008) found that
inhibition of DNA methylation resulted in significantly increased MMP1
gene transcription and an associated significant increase in MMP1
production. These effects were correlated with reduced DNA methylation
at a specific site, -1538C, in the MMP1 promoter, and DNA methylation at
that site was reduced in a larger percentage of fetal membranes that
ruptured prematurely. The authors identified another SNP, 3447T-C
(numbering based on AF007878.1; dbSNP rs2075847), and observed that the
minor C allele was always methylated in vivo and that methylation
resulted in increased affinity for a nuclear protein in amnion
fibroblasts. Plasmid transfection studies and chromatin
immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated reduced promoter activity of the
minor C allele. In a case-control study involving 284 African American
neonates from pregnancies complicated by PPROM and 361 African American
neonates from normal term pregnancies, Wang et al. (2008) found the
minor C allele to be protective against PPROM (OR = 0.7451; p = 0.0326),
consistent with its reduced promoter function. Neonates homozygous for
the major T allele had 3.51-higher risk for PPROM compared to CC
homozygotes (p = 0.007). Wang et al. (2008) concluded that, in addition
to genetic variation, DNA methylation plays a role in controlling MMP1
expression and risk of PPROM.

Titeux et al. (2008) demonstrated that the G-1607GG polymorphism in MMP1
results in transcriptional upregulation. They found a significant
association between this SNP and disease severity among patients with
autosomal recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB; 226600).

Rutter et al. (1998) identified a SNP (dbSNP rs1799750) in the promoter
region of the MMP1 gene (position -1607) where an additional guanine
nucleotide creates a binding site for members of the Ets family of
transcription factors. The 2G SNP displayed significantly higher
transcription in normal fibroblasts and in melanoma cells compared to
the 1G SNP. The occurrence of 2G homozygotes was 30% in 100 CEPH
controls; in tumor cell lines it was 62.5%. Rutter et al. (1998)
suggested that increased MMP1 expression contributes to stromal
degradation involved in tumor invasion.

Rate of Decline of Lung Function in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
Disease

Joos et al. (2002) investigated the role of MMP polymorphisms (including
G-1607GG in MMP1 and N357S in MMP12) in the development of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (see 606963). The authors determined the
prevalence of these polymorphisms in 590 continuing smokers chosen from
the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Lung Health Study for
having the fastest (284 individuals) and slowest (306 individuals)
5-year rate of decline of lung function. Of 5 polymorphisms among 3 MMP
loci, only G-1607GG was associated with a rate of decline in lung
function. This allele was associated with a fast rate of decline (p =
0.02). However, haplotypes consisting of alleles from the G-1607GG and
N357S polymorphisms were associated with rate of decline of lung
function (p = 0.0007). Joos et al. (2002) concluded that polymorphisms
in the MMP1 and MMP12 genes, but not MMP9, are either causative factors
in smoking-related lung injury or are in linkage disequilibrium with
causative polymorphisms.

Preterm Premature Rupture of the Membranes

Fujimoto et al. (2002) studied the G-1607GG promoter polymorphism in
amnion-derived cells and found that the 2G promoter had more than 2-fold
greater activity than the 1G allele. Induction of MMP1 mRNA by phorbol
12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was significantly greater in cells with a
1G/2G or 2G/2G genotype compared to cells homozygous for the 1G allele.
Analysis in 75 African American infants who were born after preterm
premature rupture of the membranes (PPROM; 610504) and 235 controls
demonstrated a significant association between fetal carriage of a 2G
allele and PPROM (OR = 2.29; p = 0.028). The authors concluded that the
2G allele has stronger promoter activity in amnion cells, that it
confers increased responsiveness of amnion cells to stimuli that induce
MMP1, and that this polymorphism contributes to the risk of PPROM.

Modifier of Epidermolysis Bullosa Dystrophica

Titeux et al. (2008) demonstrated that the G-1607GG polymorphism (dbSNP
rs1799750) in MMP1 results in transcriptional upregulation. The authors
found a significant association between this SNP and disease severity
among patients with autosomal recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa
(RDEB; 226600). In 3 affected sibs and a follow-up cohort of 31
unrelated French patients, the functional SNP resulting in increased
collagenase activity was associated with a more severe phenotype (p =
6.27 x 10(-5)). Titeux et al. (2008) concluded that increased MMP1 leads
to increased collagen degradation and worsening disease severity,
suggesting that MMP1 is a modifier gene in RDEB.

109700	TITLE *109700 BETA-2-MICROGLOBULIN; B2M
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Beta-2-microglobulin is a serum protein found in association with the
major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I heavy chain on the
surface of nearly all nucleated cells (Gussow et al., 1987).

CLONING

Cunningham et al. (1973) reported the complete amino acid sequence of
the beta-2-microglobulin protein. It is a single polypeptide chain with
a molecular mass of 11.6 kD that shows homology to immunoglobulins and
HLA, suggesting a common evolutionary origin.

Suggs et al. (1981) isolated a partial cDNA clone corresponding to the
B2M gene. The mature protein is predicted to contain 99 amino acids.

Gussow et al. (1987) isolated a full-length clone corresponding to the
human B2M gene from a human lymphoblastoid cell cDNA library. The
deduced 99-residue protein shows 70% amino acid sequence similarity to
the mouse protein.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gussow et al. (1987) determined that the B2M gene contains 4 exons and
spans approximately 8 kb.

MAPPING

Goodfellow et al. (1975) and Smith et al. (1975) mapped the B2M gene to
chromosome 15 by somatic cell hybridization.

Manolov et al. (1979) reported that the Daudi lymphoblastoid cell line,
which is derived from Burkitt lymphoma (113970) and lacks both HLA
antigens and beta-2-microglobulin, has 1 normal chromosome 15 and 1 with
a deletion of 15q12-q21. Using high resolution banding techniques, Zhang
and Zech (1981) concluded that the abnormal chromosome 15 in the Daudi
cell line is del(15)(q13q15).

Cox et al. (1982) assigned the mouse B2m gene to mouse chromosome 2,
which is syntenic to human chromosome 15, and suggested that B2M is not
linked to major histocompatibility or immunoglobulin loci.

GENE FUNCTION

Arce-Gomez et al. (1978) made somatic cell hybrids between the Daudi
lymphoblastoid cell line and a human cell line derived from HeLa and
also showing no HLA antigens. The hybrid cells did express HLA antigens.
Since Daudi cells do not express B2M despite the presence of a
chromosome 15, reexpression in the hybrid cells was thought to be due to
provision of beta-2-microglobulin by the other parental cell line. The
experiment showed that beta-2-microglobulin is essential to expression
of HLA.

On the basis of molecular cloning studies, Margulies et al. (1983)
suggested that the Ly-m11 antigenic determinant demonstrated on
lymphocytes by a monoclonal antibody is on the B2M molecule.

The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) is a heterodimer of a nonclassical MHC
class I alpha chain (FCGRT; 601437) and B2M that binds the 2 most
abundant serum proteins, IgG and albumin (ALB; 103600), after their
constitutive cellular uptake. FcRn binds both proteins, thus acting as a
salvage pathway, protecting them from lysosomal degradation and
extending the catabolic half-lives of both proteins (Wani et al., 2006).

- Disease Associations

Like immunoglobulins, prealbumin, and the beta protein (APP; 104760)
found in the amyloid of Alzheimer disease (104300), beta-2-microglobulin
has a predominantly beta-pleated sheet structure that may adopt the
fibrillar configuration of amyloid in certain pathologic states
(Cunningham et al., 1973).

Beta-2-microglobulin had been found in the serum of normal individuals
and in the urine in elevated amounts in patients with Wilson disease
(277900), cadmium poisoning, and other conditions leading to renal
tubular dysfunction (Berggard and Bearn, 1968).

Hemodialysis-related amyloidosis (HRA) is a form of systemic amyloidosis
with a predilection for the synovium and bone that occurs with a
disturbingly high frequency among patients on long-term hemodialysis.
The clinical features include carpal tunnel syndrome, erosive
arthropathy, spondyloarthropathy, lytic bone lesions, and pathologic
fractures. Gejyo et al. (1985) found that protein that accumulates in
amyloid-laden tissue obtained from a chronic hemodialysis patient with
carpal tunnel syndrome was identical to B2M in several characteristics.
Connors et al. (1985) demonstrated the in vitro creation of amyloid
fibers from B2M. Gorevic et al. (1985, 1986) reported the amino acid
sequence of the HRA subunit protein and identified it as
beta-2-microglobulin. The occurrence of amyloidosis in these patients
can be prevented by periodic use of high-permeability membranes or
intermittent hemofiltration.

Charra et al. (1984) reported that 38 of 52 patients receiving
hemodialysis for more than 8 years for chronic renal failure not due to
amyloid nephropathy developed carpal tunnel syndrome. Tissues excised at
surgical decompression contained amyloid. In 95% of these patients,
shoulder pain, which was presumed to be due to amyloid deposits, was
present. McClure et al. (1986) demonstrated the beta-2-microglobulin
nature of the amyloid in 3 patients with carpal tunnel syndrome
requiring decompression surgery after long-term hemodialysis treatment
for chronic renal failure not due to amyloid nephropathy. Zingraff et
al. (1990) described a patient with severe renal insufficiency who had
beta-2-microglobulin amyloidosis despite the fact that dialysis had
never been performed. The authors suggested that some B2M variants are
more amyloidogenic than others.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Some tumors lack cell surface expression of HLA class I molecules and
this may be one mechanism by which tumor cells escape immune recognition
by cytotoxic T cells. In some cases, there is loss of the heavy chain
surface expression encoded by the HLA-A, -B, and -C genes which is
responsible; in other cases, expression of the B2M gene for the light
chain is responsible. The Daudi lymphoblastoid cell line, derived from a
patient with Burkitt lymphoma and lacking both HLA antigens and beta-2
microglobulin, fails to express HLA class I molecules because of a
specific defect in the B2M component. In the Daudi cell line, Rosa et
al. (1983) demonstrated a G-to-C transversion in the initiator ATG
sequence of the B2M gene, predicted to change the initiator methionine
residue to isoleucine.

In the human melanoma cell line FO-1, D'Urso et al. (1991) found that
the lack of expression of HLA class I antigens was the result of a
defect in the B2M gene: a deletion of the first exon of the 5-prime
flanking region and of a segment of the first intron.

Bicknell et al. (1994) used single-strand conformation polymorphism
(SSCP) analysis to screen a series of 37 established colorectal cell
lines, 22 fresh tumor samples, and 22 normal DNA samples for mutations
in the B2M gene. Exon 1 (including the leader peptide sequence) and exon
2 were screened separately. Mutations were found in 6 of 7 colorectal
cell lines and 1 of 22 fresh tumors, whereas no mutations were detected
in the normal DNA samples. Sequencing of these mutations showed that an
8-bp CT repeat in the leader peptide sequence was particularly variable,
since 3 of the cell lines and 1 fresh tumor sample had deletions in this
region. In 2 related colorectal cell lines, DLD-1 and HCT-15, 2 similar
mutations were identified, a C-to-A substitution in codon 10 and a
G-to-T mutation in the splice sequence of intron 1. Expression of
beta-2-microglobulin was examined using a series of monoclonal
antibodies in an ELISA system. Reduced expression correlated with a
mutation in 1 allele of the B2M gene, whereas loss of expression was
seen in instances where a line was homozygous for a mutation or
heterozygous for 2 mutations.

- Familial Hypercatabolic Hypoproteinemia

In 2 sibs with familial hypercatabolic hypoproteinemia (241600)
originally reported by Waldmann (1969), Wani et al. (2006) identified a
homozygous mutation in the B2M gene (109700.0001). The findings were
consistent with the hypothesis that FcRn, which contains B2M, binds IgG
and albumin and serves to salvage both proteins.

- Familial Visceral Amyloidosis

In 4 affected members of a family with autosomal dominant visceral
amyloidosis (105200), Valleix et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous
mutation in the B2M gene (D76N; 109700.0002). Studies on the recombinant
D76N protein showed reduced stability of the fully folded mutant protein
and significantly increased conversion of the mutant protein into
fibrils with amyloid-like properties under physiologic conditions,
whereas the wildtype protein did not aggregate at all. In mid-adult
life, the patients developed slowly progressive chronic diarrhea with
weight loss and sicca syndrome. One had sensorimotor axonal
polyneuropathy and orthostatic hypotension and 2 had severe autonomic
neuropathy. Valleix et al. (2012) noted that the amyloid deposition in
this family was different from that observed in dialysis-related
amyloidosis, in which B2M-amyloid accumulates around bones and joints.
In addition, serum B2M was not increased in the patients with familial
disease, whereas it is increased in those with dialysis-related
amyloidosis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Allelic variation in the B2m gene has been reported in the mouse
(Robinson et al., 1981).

Class I MHC molecules, known to be important for immune responses to
antigen, are expressed also by neurons that undergo activity-dependent,
long-term structural and synaptic modifications. Huh et al. (2000)
showed that in mice genetically deficient for cell surface class I MHC,
due to deletion of either TAP1 (170260) or beta-2-microglobulin, or for
a class I MHC receptor component, CD3-zeta (186780), refinement of
connections between retina and central targets during development is
incomplete. In the hippocampus of adult mutants, N-methyl-D-aspartate
receptor-dependent long-term potentiation is enhanced, and long-term
depression is absent. Specific class I MHC mRNAs are expressed by
distinct mosaics of neurons, reflecting a potential for diverse neuronal
functions. These results demonstrated an important role for these
molecules in the activity-dependent remodeling and plasticity of
connections in the developing and mature mammalian central nervous
system.

The defect in hereditary hemochromatosis (235200) resides in the HFE
gene (613609) in the class I MHC region. This fact lends significance to
the findings of de Sousa et al. (1994), who reported a comparative
histologic and quantitative analysis of iron distribution in the tissues
of mice homozygous and heterozygous for knockout of the
beta-2-microglobulin gene. Progressive hepatic iron overload,
indistinguishable from that observed in human hemochromatosis, was found
only in mice homozygous for the mutated B2M gene.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPOPROTEINEMIA, HYPERCATABOLIC
B2M, ALA11PRO

In 2 sibs with familial hypercatabolic hypoproteinemia (241600)
originally reported by Waldmann (1969), Wani et al. (2006) identified a
homozygous 913G-C transversion in exon 1 of the B2M gene, resulting in
an ala11-to-pro (A11P) substitution at the midpoint of the signal
sequence. Both sibs had B2M serum levels that were less than 1.0% of
normal as well as soluble HLA levels that were less than 0.2% of normal.
Transfection studies showed that the mutant B2M gene resulted in reduced
expression of the B2M, MHC class I, and FcRn proteins.

.0002
AMYLOIDOSIS, FAMILIAL VISCERAL
B2M, ASP76ASN

In 4 affected members of a family with autosomal dominant visceral
amyloidosis (105200), Valleix et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous
286G-A transition in the B2M gene, resulting in an asp76-to-asn (D76N)
substitution. Studies on the recombinant D76N protein showed reduced
stability of the fully folded mutant protein and significantly increased
conversion of the mutant protein into fibrils with amyloid-like
properties under physiologic conditions, whereas the wildtype protein
did not aggregate at all. Although the high-resolution crystal structure
of the mutant protein was similar to wildtype, the D76N substitution has
2 notable effects: establishment of new hydrogen bonds and increase of
the isoelectric point. In mid-adult life, the patients developed slowly
progressive chronic diarrhea with weight loss and sicca syndrome. One
had sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy and orthostatic hypotension and 2
had severe autonomic neuropathy. Postmortem examination of 1 patient,
who died at age 70 years, showed extensive B2M-containing amyloid
deposits in the spleen, liver, heart, salivary glands, and nerves.
Colonic biopsy from another affected individual also contained
B2M-containing amyloid deposits. Amyloid scinotography of 2 patients
showed a heavy visceral amyloid burden in the spleen and adrenal glands,
but not in heart. Valleix et al. (2012) noted that the amyloid
deposition in this family was different from that observed in
dialysis-related amyloidosis, in which B2M-amyloid accumulates around
bones and joints. In addition, serum B2M was not increased in the
patients with familial disease, whereas it is increased in those with
dialysis-related amyloidosis.

607860	TITLE *607860 YY1 ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1; YY1AP1
;;YY1-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; YAP;;
HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 2; HCCA2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By differential display PCR of normal hepatic tissue and hepatocellular
carcinomas, followed by screening a placenta cDNA library, Wang et al.
(2001) cloned YY1AP1, which they called HCCA2. The deduced 467-amino
acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 50.65 kD. HCCA2 contains
2 SH3-binding domains, 2 N-glycosylation sites, 6 N-myristoylation
sites, and numerous phosphorylation sites, but it does not have a
transmembrane domain, signal peptide, or targeting sequences. Northern
blot analysis detected 1.8- and 2.5-kb transcripts in all adult tissues
examined except liver. Expression was also detected in fetal liver,
lung, brain, and spleen. Western blot analysis of transfected embryonic
kidney fibroblasts detected HCCA2 at an apparent molecular mass of about
50 kD. Immunohistochemical staining showed that HCCA2 protein was
localized in the cytoplasm of liver cancer tissues, and it was not found
in surrounding nontumor hepatocytes.

Kuryshev et al. (2006) determined that YY1AP1 was formed by fusion of
the 5-prime region of the ASH1L gene (607999) and the 3-prime region of
the GON4L gene (610393) during a tandem segmental duplication on
chromosome 1. YY1AP1 contains the partial promoter and untranslated
first exon of ASH1L and coding exons 13 to 21 of GON4L. The 3-prime
region of YY1AP1 originated from a long terminal repeat of an endogenous
retrovirus, known as the MER51A repeat, that was inserted into exon 21
of GON4L after the duplication. The deduced YY1AP1 protein contains 750
amino acids, 748 of which correspond to amino acids 590 to 1,337 of the
GON4L protein. The last 2 C-terminal residues of YY1AP1 come from the
long terminal repeat of MER51A. RT-PCR detected ubiquitous expression of
YY1AP1, with highest levels in testis and skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Wang et al. (2001) determined that HCCA2 was not expressed in normal
adult liver tissue, but it was expressed in 79% of hepatocellular
carcinomas tested. HCCA2 expression was associated with invasion of the
tumor capsule.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Kuryshev et al. (2006) mapped the YY1AP1
gene to chromosome 1q22.

603819	TITLE *603819 STEROID RECEPTOR RNA ACTIVATOR 1; SRA1
;;SRA
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screening system, Lanz et al. (1999) isolated a
transcriptional coactivator of steroid nuclear receptors, termed steroid
receptor RNA activator (SRA). Northern blot analysis revealed that the
SRA gene was expressed in all human tissues tested as major transcripts
of approximately 0.7 to 0.85 kb and minor transcripts of approximately
1.3 to 1.5 kb; SRA was expressed at high levels in liver and skeletal
muscle and at a low level in brain.

GENE FUNCTION

Lanz et al. (1999) found that SRA was selective for steroid hormone
receptors and mediated transactivation via their N-terminal activation
function. The authors provided functional and mechanistic evidence that
SRA acts as an RNA transcript; transfected SRA, unlike other steroid
receptor coregulators, functioned in the presence of cycloheximide, and
SRA mutants containing multiple translational stop signals retained
their ability to activate steroid receptor-dependent gene expression.
Biochemical fractionation showed that SRA exists in distinct
ribonucleoprotein complexes, one of which contains steroid receptor
coactivator-1 (602691). Lanz et al. (1999) suggested that SRA may act to
confer functional specificity upon multiprotein complexes recruited by
liganded receptors during transcriptional activation.

By immunoprecipitation analysis, Caretti et al. (2006) found that p68
(DDX5; 180630), p72 (DDX17; 608469), and the noncoding RNA SRA
associated with MYOD (MYOD1; 159970) in MYOD-transfected HeLa cells. In
vitro and in vivo experiments identified p68, p72, and SRA as
coactivators of MYOD, and their knockdown in C2C12 mouse myoblast cells
prevented proper muscle gene expression and cell differentiation.

MAPPING

By sequence comparisons, Lanz et al. (1999) identified partial SRA
sequences isolated as HepG2 3-prime untranslated region (GenBank GENBANK
D16861), EST clones, and chromosome 5 BAC clone 319C17 (GenBank GENBANK
AC005214), providing a preliminary mapping of the SRA gene to chromosome
5.

611442	TITLE *611442 DOUBLE HOMEOBOX PROTEIN 2; DUX2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The human genome contains hundreds of repeats of the 3.3-kb family in
regions associated with heterochromatin. The DUX gene family, including
DUX2, resides within these 3.3-kb repeated elements (Beckers et al.,
2001). See DUX4 (606009).

CLONING

Using PCR amplification of genomic DNA with primers from HEFT1, a
genomic sequence identified as a DNA-binding target of HLTF (SMARCA3;
603257), Ding et al. (1998) cloned DUX2. The deduced 80-amino acid
protein shares 70% amino acid identity with DUX1 (611441), but the DUX2
sequence stops just after the first homeodomain.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ding et al. (1998) determined that the HEFT1 sequence, which presents a
consensus GC and TATAA box, and DUX1 sequences were not associated in
the genome; however, DUX2 was found carrying a promoter identical to
HEFT1.

MAPPING

By human-hamster somatic cell hybrid analysis, Ding et al. (1998)
determined that DUX2 sequences mapped to acrocentric chromosomes 13, 14,
15, 21, 22.

603011	TITLE *603011 SMALL EDRK-RICH FACTOR 1A; SERF1A
;;SMALL EDRK-RICH FACTOR 1; SERF1;;
SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY-RELATED GENE H4F5; H4F5;;
SMA MODIFIER 1; SMAM1
DESCRIPTION Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) has been classified into 3 types based on
age of onset and severity. SMA I-III all map to 5q13, and nearly all
patients display deletions or gene conversions of the SMN1 gene
(600354). Although some correlation has been established between SMN
protein levels and disease course, the genetic basis for SMA phenotypic
variability is mainly unexplained, and it had been postulated that the
loss of an additional modifying factor contributes to the severity of
type I SMA. Scharf et al. (1998) found that a multicopy microsatellite
marker deleted in more than 90% of type I SMA chromosomes was embedded
in an intron of H4F5, indicating that this gene is also highly deleted
in type I SMA chromosomes, and thus is a candidate phenotypic modifier
for SMA. The microsatellite marker, designated C212, is located in the
last intron of H4F5, 5 kb upstream of H4F5 exon 3b and 13 kb upstream of
SMN exon 1. In 58 type I SMA patients of varied European and Arabian
descent, Scharf et al. (1998) found a reduction or absence of C212/H4F5
alleles in 94% of chromosomes, implying a deletion of 1 or both copies
of the marker and therefore of H4F5 exon 3b in these individuals. In
comparison with the high rate of C212/H4F5 deletions in type I SMA, the
C212 deletion frequency in type II SMA chromosomes was between that of
type I and control chromosomes, whereas deletions in type III
chromosomes were only slightly more frequent than in controls.

Scharf et al. (1998) sequenced a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)
containing the mouse Smn gene to identify conserved elements between the
human SMA interval and its previously identified syntenic region on
mouse chromosome 13 (Scharf et al., 1996). The resulting sequence was
filtered for repetitive elements and used to screen the EST database.
ESTs corresponding to SMN and NAIP were identified as well as 2 ESTs
representing novel genes within the BAC. One of these ESTs, clone
368449, mapped to 10.6 kb upstream of mouse Smn; subsequent analysis of
surrounding genomic sequences using 4 exon-prediction programs
identified no additional transcripts between 368449 and Smn or between
Smn and Naip. The full-length 566-bp mouse 368449 cDNA and its human
ortholog were cloned from a mouse brain and human skeletal muscle cDNA
library, respectively. The human clone was 99% homologous to exon 4F5,
an exon previously trapped from an SMA cosmid known to contain SMN exon
1. The full-length human cDNA was named H4F5, and its mouse counterpart
M4f5, until an appropriate function can be assigned to the 2 genes. The
proteins displayed 97% amino acid similarity to one another and both
genes were ubiquitously expressed with highest RNA levels in testis. In
addition, H4F5 has a larger 1.8-kb isoform, H4F5L, with a predicted
110-amino acid open reading frame that results from alternative splicing
of exon 3. In contrast to the 0.6-kb mouse and 0.7-kb human 4F5S
isoforms, the 1.8-kb H4F5L transcript is predominantly expressed in
heart, brain, and skeletal muscle. Both isoforms are also expressed
throughout the central nervous system, including spinal cord, which is
the tissue primarily affected in SMA. H4F5 was found to lie closer to
SMN1 than any previously identified gene in the region.

INSULINOMA-GLUCAGONOMA PROTEIN 20; IG20;;
RAB3 GDP/GTP EXCHANGE PROTEIN; RAB3GEP;;
KIAA0358
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chow and Lee (1996) reported the cDNA sequence of DENN, a novel human
gene that is differentially expressed in normal and neoplastic cells
(hence, the symbol DENN). Northern blot analysis revealed differential
levels of expression of a 6.5-kb DENN transcript in malignant cell lines
compared to normal human tissues, where expression was highest in fetal
brain and kidney and in adult testis, ovary, brain, and heart. In fetal
liver and in several human cancer cell lines, the authors identified
cDNAs representing alternative transcripts of DENN that harbor a
deletion of 129 bp encoding 43 amino acids. Present within the serine-
and leucine-rich DENN gene product is an arginyl-glycyl-aspartic acid
(RGD) cellular adhesion motif and a leucine zipper-like motif.

Using the yeast interaction trap system to identify proteins that
interact with the death domain of the type-1 tumor necrosis factor
receptor (TNFR1; 191190), Schievella et al. (1997) isolated cDNAs
encoding 'MAP kinase-activating death domain' (MADD) protein.
Immunoblotting of immunoprecipitated proteins from various human cell
lines detected an approximately 200-kD MADD protein. The deduced
1,588-amino acid MADD protein contains a C-terminal death domain.

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1997) cloned KIAA0358. The deduced protein
contains 1,581 amino acids and is nearly identical to DENN.

Chow et al. (1998) stated that the DENN and MADD cDNAs and proteins are
virtually identical. From genomic studies, they traced the alternative
splicing of a 129-bp fragment to an alternative 5-prime donor site
involving exon 7. The deduced longer DENN isoform has 1,587 amino acids.
Western blot analysis of human MOLT-4 T-lymphoblastic leukemic cell
proteins detected a doublet consisting of 138- and 142-kD polypeptides.
The authors found the DENN protein concentrated predominantly in the
cytosolic compartment of MOLT-4 cells but was restricted to the nuclear
compartment of PLC/PRF/5 hepatoma cells.

Efimova et al. (2004) identified 7 putative splice variants of MADD:
IG20 full-length (IG20FL), IG20, KIAA0358, MADD (also referred to as
DENN), IG20 short variant-2 (IG20SV2), DENNSV (also referred to as
IG20SV3), and IG20SV4. These variants arise from alternative splicing of
exons 13L, 16, 21, 26, and 34. IG20FL, the longest variant, is encoded
by all 36 exons of the MADD gene. RT-PCR detected variable expression of
IG20, MADD, IG20SV, and DENNSV in all human tissues examined. Expression
of KIAA0358, IG20FL, and IG20SV4 was not observed.

GENE FUNCTION

Schievella et al. (1997) found that the MADD protein associated with
TNFR1 through a death domain-death domain interaction. Overexpression of
MADD activated the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase ERK2 (176948),
and expression of the MADD death domain stimulated both the ERK2 and
JNK1 (601158) MAP kinases and induced the phosphorylation of cytosolic
phospholipase A2 (600522). The authors suggested that MADD links TNFR1
with MAP kinase activation and arachidonic acid release.

Al-Zoubi et al. (2001) showed that HeLa cells permanently transfected
with IG20 or DENNSV were more susceptible or resistant to TNF-alpha
(TNFA; 191160)-induced apoptosis, respectively. All MADD variants tested
could interact with TNFR1 and activate ERK and NF-kappa-B (see 164011).
However, relative to control cells, only those expressing IG20 showed
enhanced TNF-alpha-induced activation of caspase-8 (CASP8; 601763) and
CASP3 (600636). Cowpox virus CrmA, an inhibitor of caspase-induced
apoptosis, inhibited apoptosis when transfected in IG20-expressing HeLa
cells.

Using specific small hairpin RNAs targeted to splice variants of the
MADD gene, Mulherkar et al. (2006) found that knockdown of the MADD
variant resulted in spontaneous apoptosis in HeLa cells and in a human
ovarian carcinoma cell line, and they demonstrated that the MADD variant
alone was necessary and sufficient for cancer cell survival. Mulherkar
et al. (2006) hypothesized that since the MADD variant can bind to death
receptors, it may prevent apoptotic signaling by interfering with death
receptor oligomerization.

Efimova et al. (2004) found that overexpression of DENNSV enhanced cell
replication and resistance to treatment with proapoptotic stimuli. In
contrast, IG20 expression suppressed cell replication and increased
susceptibility to proapoptotic stimuli. Moreover, cells that were
resistant or susceptible to TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis exclusively
expressed endogenous DENNSV and IG20, respectively. Transfection of IG20
in a DENNSV-expressing cell line overrode endogenous DENNSV function and
increased susceptibility to apoptotic stimuli. Dominant-negative
I-kappa-B (see NFKBIA; 164008) reversed the effects of DENNSV, but not
IG20, indicating that DENNSV functions through NF-kappa-B activation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chow et al. (1998) determined that the MADD gene spans at least 28 kb
and contains 15 exons, ranging in size from 73 to 1,230 bp.

Efimova et al. (2004) determined that the MADD gene contains 36 exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1997) mapped the MADD gene
to chromosome 11. Using FISH, Chow et al. (1998) mapped the MADD gene to
chromosome 11p11.2.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Vetter and Wurst (2001) cloned mouse Uqcc, which they called Bfzb, and
identified its human homolog by database analysis. The deduced human and
mouse proteins have a single transmembrane domain and share 94% amino
acid identity. In situ hybridization of mouse embryos detected Bfzb
predominantly in the developing nervous system, with highest expression
in proliferating neuroepithelia of brain and neural tube, ganglia of
cranial nerves V, VII, VIII, IX, and X, and dorsal root ganglia.
Transcripts were also detected in developing eye and brown fat. In adult
mouse brain, strong expression was restricted to olfactory bulb,
hippocampus, and piriform cortex and Purkinje cells of cerebellum. The
Bfzb protein localized to cytoplasmic vesicular structures.

MAPPING

Hartz (2008) mapped the UQCC gene to chromosome 20q11.22 based on an
alignment of the UQCC sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK001712) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

602013	TITLE *602013 POLYMERASE II, RNA, SUBUNIT G; POLR2G
;;RPB7, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION RNA polymerase II is the enzymatic complex responsible for transcription
of genes that result in mRNA production. For general information on the
structure and function of RNA polymerase II, see 180660.

CLONING

Schoen et al. (1997) stated that 7 of the RNA polymerase II complex
genes had been isolated and assigned to chromosomal sites. The complete
genomic sequence had been reported for only the 220-kD (POLR2A; 180660)
and 14.5-kD (POLR2I; 180662) subunits. Schoen et al. (1997) cloned,
sequenced, and mapped the seventh subunit of the RNA polymerase II
complex, which they designated hsRPB7. Southern blots of genomic and
cloned DNA suggested that it is encoded by a single gene. The sequence
of the 5-prime flanking region did not contain a TATA element, but did
contain several Sp1-binding sites, an AP-1 site, and a novel inverted
polymorphic GATA tandem repeat. Schoen et al. (1997) stated that this
novel GATA repeat should be useful for linkage analysis. The gene seemed
to be highly conserved among eukaryotic species, showing general
sequence conservation with yeast and Drosophila. Northern blot analysis
revealed a high degree of tissue-specific expression. Expression was
relatively high in adult retina, brain, and kidney.

GENE STRUCTURE

The POLR2G gene consists of 8 exons and spans approximately 5.1 kb
(Schoen et al., 1997).

GENE FUNCTION

Khazak et al. (1998) demonstrated that POLR2D (606017) associates
strongly and specifically with POLR2G in the nuclei of human cells. The
association appeared to require sequences spanning the N-terminal half
of the POLR2D protein, whereas no truncation of POLR2G was observed to
associate with POLR2D.

MAPPING

Using human radiation hybrids and YACs, Schoen et al. (1997) localized
the POLR2G gene to 11q13.1, within 70 kb of marker D11S1765.

EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 3A; EIF3A
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The integrin beta-4 subunit (ITGB4; 147557) is highly enriched in
hemidesmosomes, specialized structures providing firm mechanical links
between basal lamina and the intermediate filament cytoskeleton. A
303-amino acid segment of the ITGB4 cytoplasmic domain that encompasses
the first 2 N-terminal fibronectin type III (FNIII) domains and their
interconnecting sequence is necessary for mediating ITGB4 signaling
events and incorporation into hemidesmosomes. Using a yeast 2-hybrid
system to identify polypeptides that interact with this functional
region of the ITGB4 cytodomain, Biffo et al. (1997) isolated human
epithelial cell cDNAs encoding ITGB4-binding protein (ITGB4BP), which
they called p27BBP. Southern blot analysis showed that the human genome
contains a single copy of the ITGB4BP gene. Northern blot analysis and
in situ hybridization detected Itgb4bp mRNA in all mouse tissues
examined, with the highest levels mainly in proliferating epithelia and
in epithelial tissues containing Itgb4. The predicted human ITGB4BP
protein has 245 amino acids and lacks a signal sequence. Western blot
analysis using antibodies against ITGB4BP detected a 27-kD protein in
epithelial cell lysates, which is in agreement with the calculated
molecular mass of ITGB4BP. Both in yeast and in vitro, ITGB4BP
specifically bound to the first 2 FNIII domains of ITGB4. ITGB4BP is an
insoluble protein that is present in the nucleus and cytoplasm. It is
associated with the intermediate filament pool and is localized at the
submembrane level in close apposition with ITGB4. The authors suggested
that ITGB4BP links ITGB4 to the intermediate filament cytoskeleton.

Eukaryotic translation initiation factor-6 (EIF6) binds to the 60S
ribosomal subunit and prevents its association with the 40S ribosomal
subunit. Using antibodies against purified rabbit EIF6 protein to
immunoscreen a HeLa cell cDNA expression library, Si et al. (1997)
isolated a cDNA encoding EIF6. Northern blot analysis detected an
approximately 1.1-kb transcript in all human tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Ceci et al. (2003) demonstrated that the ribosomal 60S subunit is
activated by release of EIF6. In the cytoplasm, EIF6 is bound to free
60S but not to 80S subunits. Furthermore, EIF6 interacts in the
cytoplasm with RACK1 (176981), a receptor for activated protein kinase C
(PKC; see 176960). RACK1 is a major component of translating ribosomes,
which harbor significant amounts of PKC. Loading 60S subunits with EIF6
caused a dose-dependent translational block and impairment of 80S
formation, which were reversed by expression of RACK1 and stimulation of
PKC in vivo and in vitro. PKC stimulation led to EIF6 phosphorylation,
and mutation of a serine residue in the carboxy terminus of EIF6
impaired RACK1/PKC-mediated translational rescue. Ceci et al. (2003)
proposed that EIF6 release regulates subunit joining, and that RACK1
provides a physical and functional link between PKC signaling and
ribosome activation.

To elucidate how microRNAs mediate their repressive effects, Chendrimada
et al. (2007) performed biochemical and functional assays to identify
new factors in the microRNA pathway. Chendrimada et al. (2007) showed
that human RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex) associated with a
multiprotein complex containing MOV10 (610742), the homolog of
Drosophila translational repressor Armitage, and proteins of the 60S
ribosome subunit. Notably, this complex contains the antiassociation
factor EIF6, a ribosome inhibitory protein known to prevent productive
assembly of the 80S ribosome. Depletion of EIF6 in human cells
specifically abrogated miRNA-mediated regulation of target protein and
mRNA levels. Similarly, depletion of EIF6 in C. elegans diminished Lin4
microRNA-mediated repression of the endogenous Lin14 and Lin28 (611043)
target protein and mRNA levels. Chendrimada et al. (2007) concluded that
their results uncovered an evolutionarily conserved function of the
ribosome antiassociation factor EIF6 in microRNA-mediated
posttranscriptional silencing.

Gandin et al. (2008) demonstrated that mammalian eIF6 is required for
efficient initiation of translation in vivo. Eif6-null mouse embryos
were lethal at preimplantation. Heterozygous mice had 50% reduction of
eIF6 levels in all tissues, and showed reduced mass of hepatic and
adipose tissues due to a lower number of cells and to impaired G1/S cell
cycle progression. eIF6 heterozygous cells retained sufficient nucleolar
eIF6 and normal ribosome biogenesis. The liver of eIF6 heterozygous mice
displayed an increase of 80S in polysomal profiles, indicating a defect
in initiation of translation. Consistently, isolated hepatocytes had
impaired insulin-stimulated translation. Heterozygous mouse embryonic
fibroblasts recapitulated the organism phenotype and had normal ribosome
biogenesis, reduced insulin-stimulated translation, and delayed G1/S
phase progression. Furthermore, eIf6 heterozygous cells were resistant
to oncogene-induced transformation. Thus, Gandin et al. (2008) concluded
that eIF6 is the first eIF associated with the large 60S subunit that
regulates translation in response to extracellular signals.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Sanvito et al. (1998) mapped the
ITGB4BP gene to 20q11.2.

193065	TITLE *193065 VINCULIN; VCL
METAVINCULIN, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Vinculin is a cytoskeletal protein associated with the cytoplasmic face
of both cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix adherens-type junctions,
where it is thought to function as one of several interacting proteins
involved in anchoring F-actin to the membrane (Weller et al., 1990).

CLONING

Weller et al. (1990) determined the complete sequence of the human
vinculin gene. They found that both human and chicken embryo sequences
of vinculin contain 1,066 amino acids and, furthermore, that the 2
proteins exhibit a high level of sequence identity (greater than 95%).
Southern blots of human genomic DNA hybridized with short vinculin cDNA
fragments indicated that there is a single vinculin gene.

Koteliansky et al. (1992) determined that metavinculin is the result of
alternative splicing of the VCL gene and contains an additional exon.
Across species, the deduced protein differs from vinculin in having an
additional insert of 68 to 79 amino acids in the C-terminal half of the
molecule. By comparison of metavinculin sequences from pig, man,
chicken, and frog, Strasser et al. (1993) found a division of the insert
into 2 parts: the first variable and the second highly conserved. The
longest insert, 79 amino acids, was found in Xenopus laevis. Three
different C-terminal constructs of vinculin and metavinculin
overexpressed in E. coli could be purified by column chromatography.
Using amino acid sequencing methods on the intact molecules and their
proteolytic subfragments, together with a polyclonal antibody specific
only for metavinculin from porcine stomach, Gimona et al. (1988)
identified and sequenced the insert in the porcine metavinculin
molecule. By alignment with the complete sequence of chick fibroblast
vinculin, they determined the exact location of the insert. In porcine
metavinculin, this insert lies between the 90-kD protease-resistant
N-terminal core and the C terminus of the molecule. It contains 68 amino
acids and is flanked by KWSSK sequences, one of which is present in
vinculin. The identity of the mapped vinculin and metavinculin sequences
outside this different peptide is consistent with 2 proteins arising via
alternative splicing at the mRNA level.

GENE STRUCTURE

Moiseyeva et al. (1993) determined that the VCL gene contains 22 exons
spanning greater than 75 kb. Alternative splicing of exon 19 results in
the cardiac- and smooth muscle-specific metavinculin isoform, containing
an additional 68 amino acids.

MAPPING

By use of a panel of human-rodent somatic cell hybrids, Weller et al.
(1990) mapped the VCL gene to chromosome 10q11.2-qter. By linkage
studies in a 3-generation family, Mulligan et al. (1992) mapped the VCL
gene to chromosome 10q22.1-q23, distal to D10S22. They confirmed the
assignment by hybridization of the vinculin cDNA to flow-sorted
translocation derivative chromosomes containing that portion of
chromosome 10.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Bakolitsa et al. (2004) described the crystal structure of the
full-length vinculin molecule (1,066 amino acids), which shows a
5-domain autoinhibited conformation in which the carboxy-terminal tail
domain is held pincer-like by the vinculin head, and ligand binding is
regulated both sterically and allosterically. Bakolitsa et al. (2004)
showed that the conformational changes in the head, tail, and
proline-rich domains are linked structurally and thermodynamically, and
proposed a combinatorial pathway to activation that ensures that
vinculin is activated only at sites of cell adhesion when 2 or more of
its binding partners are brought into apposition.

Using magnetic tweezers, total internal reflection fluorescence, and
atomic force microscopy, del Rio et al. (2009) investigated the effect
of force on the interaction between talin (186745), a protein that links
liganded membrane integrins to the cytoskeleton, and vinculin, a focal
adhesion protein that is activated by talin binding, leading to
reorganization of the cytoskeleton. Application of physiologically
relevant forces caused stretching of single talin rods that exposed
cryptic binding sites for vinculin. Thus in the talin-vinculin system,
molecular mechanotransduction can occur by protein binding after
exposure of buried binding sites in the talin-vinculin system.

GENE FUNCTION

Turner and Burridge (1989) reported experiments indicating that vinculin
is the major talin-binding protein in platelets. However, in addition, a
less abundant protein of approximately 150 kD also interacted strongly
with the talin fragment. Turner and Burridge (1989) confirmed that this
protein is metavinculin, a protein previously believed to be confined to
cardiac and smooth muscle tissue.

Hu et al. (2007) developed correlational fluorescent speckle microscopy
to measure the coupling of focal adhesion proteins to actin filaments
(see 102610). Different classes of focal adhesion structural and
regulatory molecules exhibited varying degrees of correlated motions
with actin filaments, indicating hierarchical transmission of actin
motion through focal adhesions. Interactions between vinculin, talin,
and actin filaments appear to constitute a slippage interface between
the cytoskeleton and integrins, generating a molecular clutch that is
regulated during the morphodynamic transitions of cell migration.

Using immunohistochemistry, Vasile et al. (2006) examined the pattern of
vinculin/metavinculin expression in the intercalated- and Z discs of
cardiomyocytes from patients with various cardiovascular conditions
associated with hypertrophy. Tissue specimens derived from patients with
obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (CMH; see CMH15, 613255) and
aortic stenosis (see 109730) showed a universal defect of
vinculin/metavinculin expression in the intercalated disc but preserved
expression in the cardiac Z disc, whereas tissue specimens from patients
with dilated cardiomyopathy (CMD; see CMD1W, 611407), hypertensive heart
disease (see 145500), or pulmonary hypertension (see 178600) exhibited
normal expression of vinculin/metavinculin in both the Z and the
intercalated disc, despite being associated with hypertrophy. Vasile et
al. (2006) suggested that differential expression of
vinculin/metavinculin in cardiac hypertrophy might depend on the
underlying pathophysiology, with localization unaffected by hemodynamic
overload but expression in the intercalated disc substantially reduced
by obstructive disease.

Kanchanawong et al. (2010) used 3-dimensional super-resolution
fluorescence microscopy to map nanoscale protein organization in focal
adhesions. Their results revealed that integrins and actin are
vertically separated by an approximately 40-nm focal adhesion core
region consisting of multiple protein-specific strata: a
membrane-apposed integrin signaling layer containing integrin
cytoplasmic tails (see 193210), focal adhesion kinase (600758), and
paxillin (602505); an intermediate force-transduction layer containing
talin and vinculin; and an uppermost actin-regulatory layer containing
zyxin (602002), vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (601703), and
alpha-actinin (102575). By localizing amino- and carboxy-terminally
tagged talins, Kanchanawong et al. (2010) revealed talin's polarized
orientation, indicative of a role in organizing the focal adhesion
strata. Kanchanawong et al. (2010) concluded that their composite
multilaminar protein architecture provided a molecular blueprint for
understanding focal adhesion functions.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Olson et al. (2002) used SSCP to analyze the vinculin gene in 350
unrelated patients with sporadic or familial dilated cardiomyopathy
(611407) who were negative for mutations in the ACTC (102540) and TPM1
(191010) genes, and identified heterozygosity for a 3-bp in-frame
deletion (L954del; 193065.0001) and a missense mutation (R975W;
193065.0002) in 2 patients, respectively. Neither mutation was found in
500 controls. A potential risk-conferring polymorphism, A934V, was
identified in heterozygosity in a 30-year-old man with dilated
cardiomyopathy who died 2 years after diagnosis of progressive heart
failure; this variant was also found in 1 of 500 controls, a 67-year-old
woman in whom electrocardiography showed abnormal T waves but
echocardiogram was nondiagnostic for dilated cardiomyopathy. All
variants were located in exon 19, the metavinculin-specific exon of the
vinculin gene. Low-shear viscometry studies revealed variable reductions
in viscosity associated with the mutations, with greater reductions
caused by the L954del and R975W mutants. Fluorescence microscopy
confirmed the viscosity findings, with actin organization by the A934V
variant similar to wildtype, although the network appeared coarser; more
prominent bundles were observed for L954del, and R975W showed the
highest bundling activity. Electron microscopy of cardiac myocytes from
a patient with the R975W mutation showed irregular and fragmented
intercalated discs, with intact sarcomeric thin and thick filaments.

Vasile et al. (2006) analyzed the metavinculin-specific exon 19 of the
VCL gene in 389 unrelated patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
(CMH), who were negative for mutation in 8 known CMH-associated
sarcomere/myofilament-encoding genes, and identified heterozygosity for
the R975W mutation in a patient with CMH15 (613255).

In a cohort of 228 CMH patients who were negative for mutation in 12
known CMH-associated sarcomere/myofilament-encoding genes, Vasile et al.
(2006) performed comprehensive analysis of the 22 exons of the VCL gene
and identified a heterozygous mutation in 1 patient (L277M;
193065.0003). The authors noted that despite its ubiquitous expression,
the HCM-associated VCL mutation clinically yielded a cardiac-specific
phenotype.

ANIMAL MODEL

Xu et al. (1998) used a targeting vector to inactivate vinculin in
embryonic stem cells, which were then injected into mice. They found
that Vcl -/- embryos failed to develop beyond the tenth day of gestation
and at best were two-thirds of the normal size range. The most prominent
defect was lack of midline fusion of the rostral neural tube, producing
a cranial bilobular appearance and attenuation of cranial and spinal
nerve development. Heart development was curtailed at E9.5, with
severely reduced and akinetic myocardial and endocardial structures.
Somites and limbs were retarded, and ectodermal tissues were sparse and
fragile. Fibroblasts isolated from mutant embryos showed reduced
adhesion to fibronectin, vitronectin, laminin, and collagen compared to
wildtype. In addition, migration rates over these substrata were 2-fold
higher and the level of focal adhesion kinase (FAK; 600758) was 3-fold
higher. Xu et al. (1998) concluded that vinculin is necessary for normal
embryonic development, probably because of its role in the regulation of
cell adhesion and locomotion, although specific roles in neural and
cardiac development could not be ruled out.

Richards et al. (2005) analyzed hearts from Vcl +/- and wildtype mice
and found that although decreased vinculin expression enhanced
inducibility of ventricular arrhythmias, connexin-43 (GJA1; 121014)
content and distribution, and conduction velocities, were not
significantly different between mutant and wildtype mice. Richards et
al. (2005) suggested that other mechanisms, such as altered integrin
(see 192968) signaling, might contribute to arrhythmogenesis.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CARDIOMYOPATHY, DILATED, 1W
VCL, 3-BP DEL, 2862GTT

In a 39-year-old man with dilated cardiomyopathy (CMD1W; 611407), Olson
et al. (2002) identified heterozygosity for a 3-bp deletion (2862delGTT)
in exon 19 of the vinculin gene, resulting in the in-frame deletion of a
leucine residue (leu954del). The patient's father died of heart failure
at 59 years of age, and a 70-year-old paternal uncle had heart failure,
but the patient's relatives declined clinical and genetic evaluation.
The mutation was not found in 500 unrelated controls.

.0002
CARDIOMYOPATHY, DILATED, 1W
CARDIOMYOPATHY, FAMILIAL HYPERTROPHIC, 15
VCL, ARG975TRP

In a 57-year-old woman with dilated cardiomyopathy (CMD1W; 611407) who
had undergone cardiac transplantation, Olson et al. (2002) identified
heterozygosity for a 2923C-T transition in exon 19 of the vinculin gene,
resulting in an arg975-to-trp (R975W) substitution in the metavinculin
isoform. The mutation was also found in heterozygosity in 3 asymptomatic
relatives, 2 of whom were found to have disease on screening
echocardiogram: a 70-year-old maternal aunt had dilated cardiomyopathy,
and a 38-year-old daughter had mild left ventricular dilation. The
patient's 55-year-old sister carried the mutation but had normal left
ventricular dimensions and shortening/ejection fractions. The mutation
was not found in 500 unrelated controls.

In a 43-year-old woman with severe apical variant hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (CMH15; 613255), Vasile et al. (2006) identified
heterozygosity for the R975W substitution in the VCL gene, located in a
highly conserved residue in the tail region of metavinculin and
predicted to cause significant alterations in the secondary structure
and helical organization of the protein. The mutation was not found in
1,400 reference allele. Immunohistochemical analysis of the patient's
myocardium demonstrated a marked reduction of both vinculin and
metavinculin in the intercalated discs. Noting that the patient was
homozygous for wildtype vinculin and heterozygous for R975W
metavinculin, Vasile et al. (2006) suggested that the marked reduction
of proteins in the intercalated discs might be due to a
dominant-negative effect. However, after analyzing immunohistochemically
stained tissue specimens from patients with various cardiovascular
conditions associated with hypertrophy, Vasile et al. (2006) suggested
that differential expression of vinculin/metavinculin in cardiac
hypertrophy might depend on the underlying pathophysiology, with
localization unaffected by hemodynamic overload but expression in the
intercalated disc substantially reduced by obstructive disease (see GENE
FUNCTION).

.0003
CARDIOMYOPATHY, FAMILIAL HYPERTROPHIC, 15
VCL, LEU277MET

In a 76-year-old Caucasian woman with severely obstructive hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (CMH15; 613255), Vasile et al. (2006) identified a
heterozygous 829C-A transversion in exon 8 of the VCL gene, resulting in
a leu277-to-met (L277M) substitution at a conserved residue in a key
functional domain. The mutation was not detected in 400 reference
alleles. Immunostaining of myomectomy tissue from the patient showed
normal Z line staining but markedly reduced vinculin/metavinculin
staining in the intercalated discs.

608668	TITLE *608668 ZINC FINGER MYND DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 11; ZMYND11
;;BS69
BONE MORPHOGENETIC PROTEIN RECEPTOR-ASSOCIATED MOLECULE 1, INCLUDED;
BRAM1, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using adenovirus E1A as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a 16-day
whole mouse embryo cDNA library, followed by screening a human colon
carcinoma cDNA library, Hateboer et al. (1995) cloned ZMYND11, which
they called BS69. The deduced 562-amino acid protein had an apparent
molecular mass of about 69 kD following in vitro transcription and
translation. BS69 contains 2 N-terminal zinc finger motifs, followed by
a nuclear localization signal and a C-terminal E1A-binding domain.
Northern blot analysis detected a 4.7-kb transcript in all mouse tissues
examined, with highest expression in kidney.

Using the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of mouse Bmpr1a (601299)
as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human placenta cDNA library,
followed by screening a kidney cDNA library and 5-prime RACE, Kurozumi
et al. (1998) cloned a splice variant of BS69 that they designated
BRAM1. The deduced BRAM1 protein contains the C-terminal 186 amino acids
of BS69 preceded by 12 amino acids unique to BRAM1. Northern blot
analysis detected variable expression of 4.4-kb and 1.3-kb transcripts
in all tissues examined. Following transfection in mouse fibroblasts,
BRAM1 localized to the cytoplasm, whereas BS69 localized to the nucleus.

Masselink and Bernards (2000) noted that BS69 contains 3 motifs involved
in transcription regulation: a PHD finger and bromodomain in its
N-terminal half, and a MYND domain at its extreme C terminus. The MYND
domain, which is also present in the BRAM1 variant, is a 2-zinc finger
motif first identified in Drosophila Deaf1 (602635) and human MTG8
(133435).

GENE FUNCTION

By coimmunoprecipitation, Hateboer et al. (1995) confirmed direct
interaction between BS69 and the 289-amino acid isoform of E1A (289R)
following cotransfection in a human cell line; BS69 did not interact
with the shorter 243R E1A isoform. Endogenous BS69 complexed with E1A in
adenovirus-transformed human embryonic kidney cells. C-terminal deletion
mutants of BS69 failed to interact with E1A. BS69 inhibited
transactivation mediated by the 289R E1A protein, but not the 243R E1A
protein. BS69 also suppressed E1A-stimulated transcription of retinoic
acid receptor (see 180240) in COS cells.

Kurozumi et al. (1998) determined that BRAM1 interacts specifically with
the kinase domain of BMPR1A. BS69 did not interact with BMPR1A,
suggesting that the N terminus of BS69 interferes with this interaction.
Further investigation indicated that BRAM1 also interacts with TAB1
(602615). Kurozumi et al. (1998) hypothesized that a ternary complex of
MBPR1A, TAB1, and BRAM1 may be involved in BMP-TAB1-TAK1 (601426)
signaling.

Masselink and Bernards (2000) determined that full transcriptional
repression by BS69 requires the MYND domain. BS69 and BRAM1 interacted
with NCOR (600849) through the MYND domain, but BRAM1 was unable to
repress transcription, indicating that NCOR interaction is necessary but
not sufficient for BS69 repression. Expression of E1A inhibited
repression mediated by BS69.

Ansieau and Leutz (2002) showed that the MYND domain of BS69 interacts
with a conserved PxLxP motif in E1A, the Epstein-Barr virus oncoprotein
EBNA2, and a MYC (190080)-related cellular protein, MGA. The viral
proteins competed with MGA for BS69 binding in a PxLxP-dependent
fashion.

MAPPING

By FISH, Masselink and Bernards (2000) mapped the ZMYND11 gene to
chromosome 10p14.

;;HNRPC
NUCLEAR RIBONUCLEOPROTEIN PARTICLE C1 PROTEIN, INCLUDED;;
NUCLEAR RIBONUCLEOPROTEIN PARTICLE C2 PROTEIN, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The primary nuclear transcripts of RNA polymerase II, some of which are
precursors to cytoplasmic mRNA (pre-mRNA), are collectively referred to
as heterogeneous nuclear RNAs (hnRNAs). At least 20 of these proteins,
designated A1 (34 kD) through U (120 kD), are present in abundance. In
the nucleus they are found in association with a specific set of
proteins to form ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) particles. In vertebrates,
the C proteins, C1 and C2, are major constituents of these particles.
The 2 are antigenically closely related phosphoproteins, which bind
tightly to RNA in vitro (Nakagawa et al., 1986).

CLONING

Nakagawa et al. (1986) cloned cDNA for the hnRNA C proteins. Genomic
blot analysis showed homologous DNA sequences across eukaryotes from
human to yeast, indicating that the hnRNA C proteins are members of a
conserved gene family. Burd et al. (1989) reported the complete primary
structure of the hnRNP proteins A2, B1, and C2; A1, C1, and L had
previously been sequenced. They suggested that the C1 and C2 proteins
are produced by alternative splicing of a single gene transcript.
Merrill et al. (1989) found that C1 and C2 differ by the presence of a
13-amino acid insert in C2, after either glycine-106 or serine-107 of
C1. The additional 13 amino acids account for the molecular mass
difference of C2 on SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Otherwise C1
and C2 are identical; furthermore, the 3-prime and 5-prime untranslated
portions of the 2 mRNAs are identical (Swanson et al., 1987).

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the HNRNPC
gene to chromosome 14 (TMAP RH70234).

GENE FUNCTION

Locus control regions (LCRs) are regulatory DNA sequences located many
kilobases away from their cognate promoters. Mahajan et al. (2005) found
that an LCR-associated remodeling complex (LARC) purified from a human
erythroleukemia cell line exists as a single homogeneous complex of
hnRNP C1 and C2, the chromatin remodeling SWI/SNF complex (see 600014),
and the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylating (NURD; see 603526)/MECP1
(156535) complex.

Chen et al. (2006) purified the nuclear response element-binding protein
(REBiP) identified by Chen et al. (2003) in a patient with vitamin
D-dependent rickets type 2B (VDDR2B; 600785) and found a tryptic
fragment bearing 100% sequence identity with the human hnRNP C1 and C2
proteins (164020). Tryptic peptide sequencing followed by Western blot
analysis confirmed that cells from the VDDR2B patient overexpressed a
pair of anti-hnRNP C1/C2-reactive proteins of 39-40 kD, compatible with
the hnRNPC1 and the slightly larger hnRNPC2. When overexpressed in
vitamin D-responsive cells, cDNAs for both C1 and C2 inhibited VDR
(vitamin D receptor; 601769)-VDRE (vitamin D response element)-directed
transactivation by 23% and 42%, respectively (p less than 0.005 for
both). In contrast, transient expression of an hnRNP C1/C2 small
interfering RNA (siRNA) increased VDR transactivation by 39% (p less
than 0.005). Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies revealed the presence
of REBiP in vitamin D-responsive human cells and indicated that the
normal pattern of 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D-initiated cyclical movement
of the VDR on and off the VDRE is legislated by competitive, reciprocal
occupancy of the VDRE by hnRNP C1/C2. The temporal and reciprocal
pattern of VDR and hnRNP C1/C2 interaction with the VDRE was lost in
VDDR2B cells overexpressing the hnRNP C1/C2 REBiP. Chen et al. (2006)
stated that their work provided further evidence that hnRNPs are able to
influence gene transcription itself by acting as binding proteins for
hormone response elements and suggested that hnRNP C1/C2 may be a key
determinant of the temporal patterns of VDRE occupancy.

;;PURINOCEPTOR P2Y2; P2Y2; P2Y2R;;
P2U NUCLEOTIDE RECEPTOR; P2UR
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Parr et al. (1994) reported the sequence and functional expression of a
cDNA cloned from human airway epithelial cells that encodes P2RY2, a
protein with properties of a P2U nucleotide receptor. They also isolated
an identical cDNA from human colonic epithelial cells, indicating that
this is the same P2U receptor that had been functionally identified in
other human tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

The chloride ion secretory pathway that is defective in cystic fibrosis
(219700) can be bypassed by an alternative pathway for chloride ion
transport that is activated by extracellular nucleotides. Accordingly,
the P2 receptor that mediates this effect is a therapeutic target for
improving chloride secretion in CF patients. Using a retrovirus system,
Parr et al. (1994) stably expressed a human airway P2RY2 clone in 1321N1
astrocytoma cells, a human cell line unresponsive to extracellular
nucleotides. Studies of inositol phosphate accumulation and
intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization induced by extracellular nucleotides
in 1321N1 cells expressing the receptor identified this clone as the
target receptor in human airway epithelia. Expression of P2RY2 in 1321N1
cells revealed evidence for autocrine ATP release and stimulation of
transduced receptors. Thus, P2RY2 expression in the cell line was
proposed as a useful system for studying autocrine regulatory mechanisms
and for screening potential therapeutic drugs.

Katzur et al. (1999) reported that in single endometrial carcinoma
HEC-1A and Ishikawa cells, ATP induced a rapid and extracellular
Ca(2+)-independent rise in cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration in a
dose-dependent manner, with an ED50 of about 10 microg. This
ligand-selective profile indicated the expression of the P2RY2 subtype
in endometrial cells. Accordingly, RT-PCR using P2RY2 primers amplified
the expected transcript from both cell lines. The coupling of these
receptors to phospholipase C was confirmed. The authors concluded that
P2RY2 may participate in control of the cell cycle of endometrial
carcinoma cells.

Tai et al. (2000) studied the expression and regulation of the P2UR gene
in human granulosa-luteal cells (GLCs) by RT-PCR and Northern blot
analysis. Expression of P2UR mRNA was downregulated by human chorionic
gonadotropin (CG) in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Treatment with
8-bromo-cAMP and forskolin also attenuated P2UR mRNA levels. The authors
concluded that the P2UR mRNA is expressed in human GLCs and that P2UR
mRNA is regulated by human CG, cAMP, and forskolin. These findings
further supported a potential role of this neurotransmitter receptor in
the human ovary.

Adrian et al. (2000) analyzed the expression of several purinergic
receptors during differentiation in a promyelocytic leukemia cell line.
Granulocytic differentiation was induced by dimethylsulfoxide, and a
monocytic/macrophage phenotype was induced by phorbol esters. Basal
expression of P2Y2 was relatively high in undifferentiated cells, and
expression declined during granulocytic differentiation. P2Y2 expression
also decreased during monocytic differentiation and was nearly
undetectable after 48 hours.

Arthur et al. (2005) found that activation of P2ry2 by ATP-gamma-S, a
nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, in the presence of NGF (162030) led to
colocalization and association of Trka (NTRK1; 191315) and P2ry2 and was
required for enhanced neuronal differentiation in a rat neuronal
precursor cell line. Depletion of P2ry2 by genetic means or by small
interfering RNA abolished the ATP-gamma-S-mediated increase in neuronal
differentiation. Moreover, in vivo injection of ATP-gamma-S into the
sciatic nerve of wildtype mice, but not P2ry2-null mice, increased
expression of Gap43 (162060), a marker for axonal growth. Arthur et al.
(2005) concluded that P2RY2 is a morphogen receptor that potentiates
neurotrophin signaling in neuronal development and regeneration.

Chen et al. (2006) found that human neutrophils release ATP from the
leading edge of the cell surface to amplify chemotactic signals and
direct cell orientation by feedback through the P2Y2 nucleotide
receptors. Neutrophils rapidly hydrolyze released ATP to adenosine that
then acts via A3-type adenosine receptors, which are recruited to the
leading edge to promote cell migration. Thus, Chen et al. (2006) found
that ATP release and autocrine feedback through P2Y2 and A3 receptors
provide signal amplification, controlling gradient sensing and migration
of neutrophils.

Through several lines of evidence, Elliott et al. (2009) identified
extracellular nucleotides as a critical apoptotic cell 'find-me' signal.
Elliott et al. (2009) demonstrated the caspase (see 147678)-dependent
release of ATP and UTP in equimolar quantities during the early stages
of apoptosis by primary thymocytes and cell lines. Purified nucleotides
at these concentrations were sufficient to induce monocyte recruitment
comparable to that of apoptotic cell supernatants. Enzymatic removal of
ATP and UTP (by apyrase or the expression of ectopic CD39, 601752)
abrogated the ability of apoptotic cell supernatants to recruit
monocytes in vitro and in vivo. Elliott et al. (2009) then identified
the ATP/UTP receptor P2Y2 as a critical sensor of nucleotides released
by apoptotic cells using RNA interference-mediated depletion studies in
monocytes, and macrophages from P2Y2-null mice. The relevance of
nucleotides in apoptotic cell clearance in vivo was revealed by 2
approaches. First, in a murine air-pouch model, apoptotic cell
supernatants induced a 3-fold greater recruitment of monocytes and
macrophages than supernatants from healthy cells did; this recruitment
was abolished by depletion of nucleotides and was significantly
decreased in P2Y2-null mice. Second, clearance of apoptotic thymocytes
was significantly impaired by either depletion of nucleotides or
interference with P2Y receptor function (by pharmacologic inhibition or
in P2Y2-null mice). Elliott et al. (2009) concluded that their results
identified nucleotides as a critical find-me cue released by apoptotic
cells to promote P2Y2-dependent recruitment of phagocytes, and provided
evidence for a clear relationship between a find-me signal and efficient
corpse clearance in vivo.

MAPPING

Using PCR analysis of human-rodent hybrid cell line DNAs, Dasari et al.
(1996) mapped the human P2RY2 gene to chromosome 11q13.5-q14.1. The
authors noted that several G protein-coupled receptor genes, namely the
beta adrenergic receptor, the angiotensin receptor-like-1, and the
muscarinic cholinergic receptor-1, have been localized to the same
region of chromosome 11. By sequence tagged site (STS) mapping using the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database, Somers et
al. (1997) demonstrated that the P2RY2 gene maps within less than 4 cM
of the P2RY6 gene (602451), which they had mapped to 11q13.5 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization and STS mapping. This was the first
chromosomal clustering of this gene family to be described.

DESCRIPTION 
GENE FUNCTION

Using microarray and RT-PCR analyses, Zhong et al. (2007) found that the
NRIP3 gene was downregulated in all 9 nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
cell lines examined compared with normal controls. Semiquantitative
RT-PCR showed downregulation of NRIP3 in 4 of 8 lung tumor samples
compared with adjacent normal tissue. The promoter region of NRIP3 was
highly methylated in 1 NSCLC cell line and partially methylated in 4
others, and treatment of several NSCLC cell lines with a combination of
DNA methylation and histone deacetylase inhibitors restored NRIP3
expression.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhong et al. (2007) determined that the promoter region of the NRIP3
gene contains a CpG island.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Zhong et al. (2007) mapped the NRIP3 gene
to chromosome 11p15.3.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Conboy et al. (1986) reported the molecular cloning and characterization
of human erythrocyte protein 4.1 cDNA and the complete amino acid
sequence of the protein. Probes prepared from the cloned erythrocyte
protein 4.1 cDNA hybridized with distinct mRNA species from a wide
variety of nonerythroid tissues, including brain, liver, placenta,
pancreas, and intestine, implying substantial homology between erythroid
and nonerythroid protein 4.1. Brain protein 4.1, also known as synapsin
I (313440), is the best characterized of the nonerythroid forms.

Tang et al. (1988) compared nucleotide sequences of mRNA encoding
erythroid and lymphoid protein 4.1 isoforms. The lymphoid protein 4.1
isoforms exhibited several nucleotide sequence motifs that appeared
either to be inserted into or deleted from the mRNA by alternative
splicing of a common mRNA precursor. One of the motifs, located within
the spectrin-actin binding domain, was found only in erythroid cells and
was specifically produced during erythroid cell maturation. Conboy et
al. (1988) demonstrated that alternative splicing accounts for multiple
isoforms of protein 4.1 in red cells. In his Figure 2, Conboy (1993)
provided a map of the alternative splicing of protein 4.1 mRNA,
emphasizing the total chromosome relative to many combinatorial splicing
possibilities among the exons of the EPB41 gene. There are, furthermore,
2 AUG initiation codons, 1 of which accounts for an N-terminal extension
on the 80-kD gene product.

By tissue screening, Baklouti et al. (1997) examined the complex pattern
of alternative splicing variants of the protein 4.1 gene. They noted
that many splicing variations occur in the spectrin/actin binding (SAB)
domain. In particular, they found a 51-bp exon that was expressed almost
exclusively in muscle.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Baklouti et al. (1997) determined that 22
exons spanning approximately 200 kb contain the entire erythroid and
nonerythroid coding sequences of the human protein 4.1 gene.

MAPPING

The protein 4.1 gene was mapped to chromosome 1pter-p32 (Conboy et al.,
1985, 1986) by hybridization to chromosomes sorted onto nitrocellulose
filters using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Studies of
translocations also localized the gene to chromosome 1pter-p32, the
region of the Rh gene (Kan, 1986). Thus, it seemed certain that the
protein 4.1 gene is mutant in Rh-linked elliptocytosis-1 (EL1; 611804).

Tang and Tang (1991) concluded that the EL1 gene is located in band
1p34.2-p33 on the basis of the FLpter value (the fractional length of
the total chromosome relative to the terminus of the short arm).

Parra et al. (1998) stated that the EPB41 gene is located on chromosome
1p33-p32.

Bahary et al. (1991) assigned the mouse Epb41 gene to chromosome 4.

GENE FUNCTION

The red cell membrane cytoskeletal network consists of spectrin (bands 1
and 2; see 182860 and 182870), actin (band 5; see 102630), and protein
4.1. Actin and protein 4.1 interact with spectrin at the junction of
spectrin heterotetramers. The resulting complex plays a critical role in
erythrocyte shape and deformability. (The protein band nomenclature
given here is that of Fairbanks et al., 1971.) Correas et al. (1986)
determined the complete primary structure of the functional site of
protein 4.1 involved in spectrin-actin associations. Antibodies against
2 different synthetic peptides of this portion of the protein inhibited
association between protein 4.1, spectrin, and actin.

Ponthier et al. (2006) stated that the 4.1R protein in early erythroid
progenitors, derived from transcripts in which exon 16 is skipped,
exhibits low affinity for spectrin and actin. In contrast, late-stage
erythroblasts include exon 16 and express a high-affinity isoform. This
stage-specific repression of exon 16 inclusion is mediated in part by
the binding of HNRNPA/B (602688) proteins to exonic splicing silencer
elements located within the exon. Ponthier et al. (2006) also found that
FOX1 (A2BP1; 605104) and FOX2 (RBM9; 612149) stimulate exon 16 splicing
into a 4.1R pre-mRNA minigene via specific binding to UGCAUG splicing
enhancer motifs downstream of exon 16.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Conboy et al. (1986) showed by Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA
from an Algerian family that in affected members the mutant protein 4.1
gene had a DNA rearrangement upstream from the initiation codon for
translation. The mRNA from the mutant gene was aberrantly spliced.

Lambert et al. (1988) reported an elliptocytosis family in which an
apparent rearrangement of the coding region of the protein 4.1 gene led
to restriction fragment length polymorphism when DNA was tested using a
fragment of the cDNA that encompassed the coding region of the gene.

McGuire et al. (1988) described a distinct variant of protein 4.1 in
each of 3 families with elliptocytosis. Affected members of family C, of
Italian ancestry, had red cells with reduced content of protein 4.1 of
normal molecular mass (approximately 80 kD).

EVOLUTION

Tan et al. (2005) found that the EPB41 and EPB41L3 (605331) genes from
fish, bird, amphibian, and mammalian genomes exhibit shared features,
including alternative first exons and differential splicing acceptors in
exon 2. In all cases, the most 5-prime exon, exon 1A, splices
exclusively to a weaker internal acceptor site in exon 2, skipping a
fragment designated exon 2-prime. Conversely, alternative first exons 1B
and 1C always splice to the stronger first acceptor site, retaining exon
2-prime. These correlations were independent of cell type or species of
origin. Since exon 2-prime contains a translation initiation site,
splice variants generate protein isoforms with distinct N termini. Tan
et al. (2005) calculated that coupling between upstream promoters and
downstream splicing in EPB41 and EBP41L3 has been conserved for at least
500 million years.

ANIMAL MODEL

The complex EPB41 gene on human chromosome 1p encodes a diverse family
of protein 4.1R isoforms. The prototypic 80-kD 4.1R in mature
erythrocytes is a key component of the erythroid membrane skeleton that
regulates red cell morphology and mechanical stability. To study the
function of 4.1R in nucleated cells, Shi et al. (1999) generated mice
with complete deficiency of all 4.1R protein isoforms. These 4.1R-null
mice were viable, with moderate hemolytic anemia but no gross
abnormalities. Platelet morphology and function were essentially normal.
Nonerythroid 4.1R expression patterns revealed focal expression in
specific neurons in the brain and in select cells of other major organs,
challenging the view that 4.1R expression is widespread among
nonerythroid cells.

Epb41-knockout mice have fragmented red blood cells that lack
glycophorin C (GPC; see 110750). In Epb41-null murine erythroblasts,
Salomao et al. (2010) found that GPC distributed exclusively to the
nuclei, whereas in enucleating erythroblasts from wildtype bone marrow,
GPC partitioned almost exclusively to nascent reticulocytes, with little
or no GPC observed in plasma membranes of extruding nuclei. In contrast,
glycophorin A (GPA; see 111300) partitioning was not perturbed, and GPA
sorted to nascent reticulocytes in both Epb41-null and wildtype
enucleating erythroblasts. The findings indicated that GPC deficiency in
Epb41-null erythroblasts is attributable to markedly abnormal protein
partitioning during enucleation, and suggested that reticulocytes in
hereditary elliptocytosis may differ from normal reticulocytes in their
biophysical properties of membrane cohesion or membrane deformability.
The results also showed that cytoskeletal attachments are an important
factor in regulating transmembrane protein sorting to reticulocytes.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ELLIPTOCYTOSIS 1
EPB41, 318-BP DEL

This mutation was first reported by Feo et al. (1980) and Tchernia et
al. (1981) in homozygotes and heterozygotes and by Alloisio et al.
(1985) in heterozygotes. In this form of elliptocytosis (611804),
Takakuwa et al. (1986) demonstrated restitution of normal membrane
stability by incorporation of purified protein 4.1 into deficient red
cells by exchange hemolysis.

In an Algerian family with hereditary elliptocytosis caused by
deficiency of erythroid protein 4.1 (described by Tchernia et al., 1981;
defect partially characterized by Conboy et al., 1986), Conboy et al.
(1993) delineated the defect by study of erythroid and nonerythroid
cells in 1 of the homozygously affected sibs. The molecular lesion was
shown to involve deletion of the downstream AUG initiation codon in 4.1
mRNA, thus leading to the absence of protein 4.1 in red cells. In
contrast, isoforms that use the upstream AUG were detected in
nonerythroid cells, thus explaining the absence of manifestations in
other organ systems. The lesion consisted of a 318-nucleotide deletion
that encompassed the downstream AUG but left the upstream AUG intact.
Normally, multiple protein 4.1 isoforms are expressed in a variety of
tissues through complex alternative pre-mRNA splicing events, one
function of which is to regulate use of 2 alternative translation
initiation signals. Late erythroid cells express mainly the downstream
initiation site for synthesis of prototypic 80-kD isoforms; nonerythroid
cells in addition use an upstream site to encode higher molecular mass
isoform(s).

ELLIPTOCYTOSIS 1
PROTEIN 4.1(95)
EPB41, 369-BP DUP

In affected members of family N of Scottish-Irish descent, McGuire et
al. (1988) found heterozygosity for a high molecular weight form of
protein 4.1 at approximately 95 kD, referred to as protein 4.1(95).
Marchesi et al. (1990) described the site and nature of the insertion
resulting in protein 4.1(95) and the functional consequences of the
mutation. The elliptocytosis (611804) was mild without anemia. Protein
4.1(95) was found to contain an insertion of about 15 kD adjacent to the
spectrin/actin domain of the protein comprised, at least in part, of
repeated sequence. Conboy et al. (1990) used polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) techniques to clone and sequence mutant reticulocyte mRNAs and
correlate the duplication end points with exon boundaries of the gene.
Protein 4.1(95) mRNA was found to encode a protein with 2 spectrin/actin
binding domains by virtue of a 369-nucleotide duplication from the codon
for lys407 to that for gln529.

.0004
ELLIPTOCYTOSIS 1
PROTEIN 4.1(68/65)
EPB41, 240-BP DEL

In affected members of family G, of Italian descent, McGuire et al.
(1988) found heterozygosity for normal 4.1(80) and 2 low molecular
weight forms of protein 4.1 at about 68 and 65 kD, referred to as
protein 4.1(68/65). The mutation was associated with moderate
elliptocytosis (611804) and anemia. Protein 4.1(68/65) was found to lack
the entire spectrin/actin binding domain. Conboy et al. (1990)
demonstrated that protein 4.1(68/65) mRNA lacked sequences encoding the
functionally important spectrin-actin binding domain due to a
240-nucleotide deletion spanning the codons for lys407 to gly486.
Marchesi et al. (1990) described the site and nature of the deletions
resulting in protein 4.1(68/65) and the functional consequences of these
mutations.

ELLIPTOCYTOSIS 1
PROTEIN 4.1 MADRID
EPB41, MET1ARG

Dalla Venezia et al. (1992) studied homozygous hereditary elliptocytosis
(611804) in a Spanish patient whose parents were second cousins. He had
had intermittent jaundice and pallor since birth. During aplastic crisis
at the age of 31 years, the spleen was very large and was removed and
cholecystectomy for gallstones was also performed. Remarkable
hematologic improvement followed. The mother of the propositus was
healthy, although her blood smear showed elliptocytosis; the father was
deceased. Glycophorin C was sharply reduced. This finding, as in other
homozygous elliptocytosis cases, indicates that protein 4.1 stabilizes
glycophorin C (110750) in the membrane. Spectrin and actin were
slightly, yet significantly, diminished. Dalla Venezia et al. (1992)
demonstrated an abnormality in 4.1 cDNA, specifically an AUG-to-AGG
transversion in the downstream translation initiation codon, changing
methionine to arginine. No obvious disorders were noted in cell types
other than red cells or possibly sperm cells. The propositus, born in
1948, had infertility associated with azoospermia and a right
ureterocele. Whereas heterozygous 4.1(-) HE accounts for one-fourth to
one-third of all HE in Caucasians, the incidence of homozygous 4.1(-) HE
was, in the opinion of Dalla Venezia et al. (1992), lower than
anticipated. They suggested that some 4.1(-) HE alleles may not be
viable in the homozygous state by virtue of affecting all isoforms of
the protein and leaving all cells deficient in protein 4.1. This was the
first identification of a specific point mutation.

ELLIPTOCYTOSIS 1
PROTEIN 4.1 LILLE
EPB41, MET1THR

Like protein 4.1 Madrid (130500.0001), protein 4.1 Lille cause
elliptocytosis (611804) and results from a mutation in the downstream
translation start site (AUG-to-ACG). See Garbarz et al. (1995).

609977	TITLE *609977 CELL DIVISION CYCLE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 8; CDCA8
;;DASRA B;;
BOREALIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CDCA8 is a component of a chromosomal passenger complex required for
stability of the bipolar mitotic spindle (Gassmann et al., 2004).

CLONING

By database analysis, Sampath et al. (2004) identified human CDCA8 as a
homolog of Xenopus Dasra B. The deduced 280-amino acid human protein,
which the authors called Dasra B, shares 42% and 23% identity with
Xenopus Dasra B and Dasra A, respectively. Immunofluorescence on
metaphase HeLa cells revealed Dasra B in a punctate distribution on
chromosomes, coincident with Aurora B (AURKB; 604970) staining.

Using a proteomic screen to identify proteins associated with
histone-depleted mitotic chromosomes, Gassmann et al. (2004) identified
CDCA8, which they called borealin. The deduced 280-amino acid protein
contains 2 putative nuclear localization signals. Secondary structure
predictions suggested borealin forms an N-terminal domain of 6 core
helices and a C-terminal domain of at least 2 strands and 3 helices.
Northern and Western blot analyses showed that borealin mRNA and protein
levels were significantly increased in mitosis. Immunolocalization of
borealin and Aurora B in HeLa cells revealed that the proteins
colocalized in a dynamic pattern throughout mitosis. Western blot
analysis detected borealin at an apparent molecular mass of 31 kD in
HeLa cell lysates.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoprecipitation of HeLa cell lysates, Sampath et al. (2004) found
that Dasra B interacted with Aurora B and survivin (BIRC5; 603352).
Knockdown of Dasra B by small interfering RNA resulted in severe
chromosome misalignment at metaphase and accumulation of multiple
interphase nuclei. In Xenopus, Dasra B associated with survivin, Aurora
B, and Incenp (604411) in a chromosomal passenger complex required for
chromatin-induced microtubule stabilization and spindle formation.
Microtubule nucleation through the Dasra B-containing chromosomal
passenger complex was distinct from the Ran (601179)-GTP pathway of
chromatin-induced microtubule nucleation.

Using in vitro binding assays, Gassmann et al. (2004) showed that
recombinant human borealin interacted directly with in vitro translated
INCENP and survivin, but not with Aurora B or TD60 (RCC2; 609587).
Borealin also readily bound itself. Mutation analysis indicated that the
N-terminal domain of borealin, but not the C-terminal domain, interacted
with chromosomal passengers in vivo and could perturb their targeting to
centromeres but not to the spindle midzone. Knockdown of borealin in
HeLa cells by RNA interference resulted in delocalization of INCENP,
survivin, Aurora B, and TD60 and delayed mitotic progression.
Borealin-null cells showed kinetochore-spindle misattachments, increased
number of bipolar spindles associated with ectopic asters, and disrupted
chromosome partitioning at anaphase. Borealin did not increase the
kinase activity of Aurora B in the presence of INCENP and survivin, but
it was an Aurora B target protein.

Tsukahara et al. (2010) isolated a fission yeast cyclin B (123836)
mutant defective specifically in chromosome biorientation. Accordingly,
Tsukahara et al. (2010) identified Cdk1 (116940)-cyclin B-dependent
phosphorylation of survivin (603352). Preventing survivin
phosphorylation impaired centromere chromosomal passenger complex (CPC)
targeting as well as chromosome biorientation, whereas phosphomimetic
survivin suppressed the biorientation defect in the cyclin B mutant.
Survivin phosphorylation promoted direct binding with shugoshin (see
609168), which Tsukahara et al. (2010) defined as a conserved
centromeric adaptor of the CPC. In human cells, the phosphorylation of
borealin has a comparable role. Tsukahara et al. (2010) concluded that
this study resolved the conserved mechanisms of CPC targeting to
centromeres, highlighting a key role of Cdk1-cyclin B in chromosome
biorientation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gassmann et al. (2004) determined that the CDCA8 gene contains 10 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Gassmann et al. (2004) mapped the CDCA8

;;CANCER/TESTIS ANTIGEN 45, MEMBER 4; CT45.4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for genes upregulated in testis, followed by RT-PCR and
genomic sequence analysis, Chen et al. (2005) identified 6 nearly
identical copies of the CT45 gene, designated CT45A1 through CT45A6, on
chromosome X. The CT45 genes appeared to be products of a recent gene
duplication. RT-PCR and EST analysis revealed 3 CT45 transcript variants
that differ in their 3-prime ends and represent the accumulated
expression of the CT45 genes. All 3 transcripts encode a deduced
189-amino acid protein that shares significant similarity with DDX26B,
SAGE (300359), and DDX26 (604331). RT-PCR detected high CT45 expression
in testis and variable expression in several cell lines.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chen et al. (2005) determined that each CT45 gene contains 5 exons and
spans 8 to 9 kb. The first exon is untranslated.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Chen et al. (2005) mapped the CT45 gene
cluster to a 125-kb region on chromosome Xq26.3. The 3 centromeric genes
are transcribed in the centromeric-to-telomeric direction, and the 3
telomeric genes are transcribed in the opposite direction.

604665	TITLE *604665 COP9, SUBUNIT 3; COPS3
;;SGN3
DESCRIPTION To identify new components of the 26S proteasome, Seeger et al. (1998)
obtained peptide sequences from a 45-kD protein. By micropeptide
sequence analysis and probing of cDNA libraries, Seeger et al. (1998)
isolated a cDNA encoding COPS3, which they termed SGN3, for subunit 3 of
a novel 450-kD signalosome complex that also includes TRIP15 (604508),
COPS5 (604850), GPS1 (601934), and 4 other subunits. Sequence analysis
predicted that COPS3 is a 403-amino acid protein which contains regions
with homology to the 26S proteasome S3 regulatory subunit.
Autoradiographic analysis showed that the complex phosphorylates JUN
(165160), IKBA (164008), and the C-terminal part of the p105 precursor
of NFKB (164011). The 26S proteasome is not a phosphorylation target,
although immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that the 450-kD
complex has a cytosolic localization, concentrated around the nucleus.

Elsea et al. (1999) reported the localization and partial
characterization of SGN3. They mapped the SGN3 gene to 17p11.2 by
somatic cell hybrid analysis. By analysis of genomic clones, they
further localized the SGN3 gene to the distal end of the Smith-Magenis
syndrome (SMS) critical region (182290), near marker D17S71. Although
SMS patients were haploinsufficient for SGN3, analyses showed that the
SGN3 protein was present at equivalent levels in patient and parental
control cells, and that the COP9 signalosome complex was assembled and
in normal quantities in transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines from
patients. Elsea et al. (1999) concluded that SGN3 probably does not play
a significant role with respect to SMS, although its involvement could
not be ruled out since the importance of the COP9 signalosome in
embryogenesis or differentiation was not well understood.

;;T2R3
DESCRIPTION See also TAS2R10 (604791).

Adler et al. (2000) identified members of a family of 40 to 80 human and
rodent G protein-coupled receptors expressed in subsets of taste
receptor cells of the tongue and palate epithelia. These candidate taste
receptors, which the authors called T2Rs, are organized in the genome in
clusters and are genetically linked to loci that influence bitter
perception in mice and humans. Each T2R gene encodes a 7-transmembrane
receptor protein. The amino acid sequence identities between human and
mouse T2Rs range from 46 to 67%. The authors determined that a single
taste receptor cell expresses a large repertoire of T2Rs, suggesting
that each cell may be capable of recognizing multiple tastants. In situ
hybridization demonstrated that T2Rs are exclusively expressed in taste
receptor cells that contain the G protein subunit gustducin, implying
that they function as gustducin-linked receptors. Adler et al. (2000)
identified T2R3 in a PAC clone from 7q31.3-q32.

transduction.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

KLK8 belongs to the kallikrein subgroup of serine proteases, which have
diverse physiologic functions in many tissues. For background
information on kallikreins, see 147960.

CLONING

By searching an EST database, followed by PCR on hippocampus and
keratinocyte cDNA and RACE, Yoshida et al. (1998) isolated a cDNA
encoding KLK8, the human homolog of mouse neuropsin. The deduced
260-amino acid protein, 72% identical to the mouse sequence, has an
N-terminal signal peptide, conserved residues for protease activity, an
N-linked glycosylation site, and 13 cys residues. Northern blot analysis
detected a 0.9-kb transcript in keratinocytes.

Using a similar strategy, Mitsui et al. (1999) obtained cDNAs encoding
260- and 305-amino acid KLK8 isoforms, which they termed type-1 and
type-2 neuropsin, respectively. Sequence analysis determined that type 2
has a 45-residue leucine- and proline-rich insert at the C terminus of
the putative leader sequence of type 1. Mouse and human genomic sequence
analysis indicated that type 2 is a species-specific splice variant for
humans. Northern blot analysis revealed that type 1 is most intensely
expressed in pancreas, with lower expression in placenta, whereas type 2
is expressed in brain, suggesting organ-specific alternative splicing.
RT-PCR analysis detected type 2 expression in hippocampus. Dot blot
hybridization demonstrated expression of type 2 in all investigated
areas of the brain. Western blot analysis showed that type-1 and type-2
neuropsin are secreted as 35- and 38-kD proteins, respectively, from
insect cells.

By RT-PCR analysis using degenerate primers for serine proteases in
normal ovary and ovarian carcinoma, Underwood et al. (1999) identified a
cDNA encoding KLK8, which they called TADG14. Database searching showed
that TADG14 is identical to the 280-amino acid human neuropsin at the
protein but not the cDNA level. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.4-kb
transcript that was highly overexpressed in 20 of 30 ovarian carcinomas
studied. Western blot analysis detected a 30-kD protein in tumor cell
lines. Immunohistochemical analysis detected KLK8 in carcinoma but not
normal ovarian tissue. Underwood et al. (1999) suggested that
circulating KLK8 may be a useful marker for early detection of ovarian
carcinoma.

By RT-PCR of 35 adult and fetal tissues, Gan et al. (2000) detected
highest KLK8 expression in adult skin. Most other tissues showed weak
KLK8 expression.

Kishi et al. (2003) demonstrated K8 protein in ovarian cancer tissue
extracts, serum, and ascites fluid, suggesting that it may serve as a
new ovarian cancer marker.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Yoshida et al. (1998) determined that KLK8
is a single-copy gene that contains 6 exons and spans 5.4 kb. Promoter
analysis revealed atypical TATA and CCAAT box sequences.

GENE FUNCTION

Attwood et al. (2011) demonstrated in mice that the serine protease
neuropsin is critical for stress-related plasticity in the amygdala by
regulating the dynamics of the EphB2-NMDA receptor interaction, the
expression of Fkbp5 (602623), and anxiety-like behavior. Stress results
in neuropsin-dependent cleavage of EphB2 in the amygdala, causing
dissociation of EphB2 from the NR1 (138249) subunit of the NMDA receptor
and promoting membrane turnover of EphB2 receptors. Dynamic EphB2-NR1
interaction enhances NMDA receptor current, induces Fkpb5 gene
expression, and enhances behavioral signatures of anxiety. On stress,
neuropsin-deficient mice do not show EphB2 cleavage and its dissociation
from NR1, resulting in a static EphB2-NR1 interaction, attenuated
induction of the Fkbp5 gene, and low anxiety. The behavioral response to
stress can be restored by intraamygdala injection of neuropsin into
neuropsin-deficient mice and disrupted by the injection of either
anti-EphB2 antibodies or silencing the Fkbp5 gene in the amygdala of
wildtype mice. Attwood et al. (2011) concluded that their findings
established a novel neuronal pathway linking stress-induced proteolysis
of EphB2 in the amygdala to anxiety.

MAPPING

Harvey et al. (2000) mapped the KLK8 gene to chromosome 19q13.4 in the
KLK gene cluster between KLK7 (604438) and KLK9 (605504). They noted
that KLK5 (605643) to KLK14 are transcribed telomere to centromere.

EVOLUTION

Lu et al. (2007) demonstrated that type-2 KLK8 is absent from nonhuman
primates, indicating that it is human specific. In vitro splicing assays
revealed a human-specific mutation that triggers the change in splicing
pattern, and mutation assays showed that this mutation is necessary and
sufficient for type-2 KLK8 expression.
