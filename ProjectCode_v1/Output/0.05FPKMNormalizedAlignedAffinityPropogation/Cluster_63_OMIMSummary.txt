;;OCULAR DEVELOPMENT-ASSOCIATED GENE; ODAG
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Tsuruga et al. (2002) cloned mouse Gatad1, which they called Odag, and
they identified human GATAD1 by database analysis. The deduced mouse and
human proteins contain 266 and 269 amino acids, respectively. Both
proteins have an N-terminal zinc finger, and they share 92% identity.
Northern blot analysis detected expression of a 2.5-kb Gatad1 transcript
in all mouse tissues examined, with highest levels in testis and lung.
RT-PCR of developing mouse eye revealed high Gatad1 expression from
embryonic day 13, the earliest day examined, until postnatal day 6.
Expression was reduced at postnatal day 10 and absent by postnatal day
14. In situ hybridization of mouse eye revealed Gatad1 expression in
lens, ciliary body, retina, sclera, and conjunctiva at postnatal days 2
and 7. Postnatal day-7 retina showed Gatad1 expression in the inner
nuclear layer, outer plexiform layer, and outer nuclear layer. No
expression was observed in retina at postnatal day 14, suggesting that
GATAD1 functions specifically during development.

Using immunohistochemistry in healthy left ventricular tissue, Theis et
al. (2011) demonstrated localization of GATAD1 to the nucleus and
cytoplasm with a homogeneous striated staining pattern.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tsuruga et al. (2002) determined that the GATAD1 gene contains 5 coding
exons that span about 9 kb.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the GATAD1 gene to chromosome 7q21.2 based on an
alignment of the GATAD1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK26142) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 affected sibs from a consanguineous family of Norwegian ancestry
segregating autosomal recessive dilated cardiomyopathy mapping to
chromosome 7q21 (CMD2B; 614672), Theis et al. (2011) identified
homozygosity for a missense mutation in the GATAD1 gene (614518.0001).
Screening of GATAD1 in an additional 273 probands with CMD did not
reveal any mutations.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CARDIOMYOPATHY, DILATED, 2B
GATAD1, SER102PRO

In 3 affected sibs from a consanguineous family of Norwegian ancestry
segregating autosomal recessive dilated cardiomyopathy (CMD2B; 614672),
Theis et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for a 304T-C transition in
exon 2 of the GATAD1 gene, resulting in a ser102-to-pro (S102P)
substitution at a conserved residue. Their 6 unaffected sibs were either
heterozygous or homozygous for the wildtype GATAD1 allele, and the
mutation was not found in 474 controls of similar ancestry with normal
echocardiograms. Immunohistochemical analysis of cardiac biopsy tissue
from the proband revealed a marked disturbance in extranuclear
distribution of GATAD1 compared to controls. In addition, myocyte nuclei
in the proband had a unique globular morphology, contrasting with the
elongated spindle shape observed in controls.

;;MANNOSIDASE, ALPHA B, LYSOSOMAL; MANB;;
LAMAN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Alpha-mannosidase (EC 3.2.1.24) is a lysosomal hydrolase that cleaves
alpha-linked mannose residues from the nonreducing end of N-linked
glycoproteins (Gotoda et al., 1998).

See also beta-mannosidase (MANBA; 609489).

CLONING

Nebes and Schmidt (1994) isolated and sequenced a cDNA for
alpha-mannosidase. Liao et al. (1996) used RT-PCR to clone 2 cDNAs
encoding human lysosomal alpha-mannosidase. The shorter of the 2 cDNAs
encodes a 3-kb open reading frame which, when expressed, produces a
functional alpha-mannosidase enzyme; the longer cDNA, encoding a 3.6-kb
open reading frame, produced no alpha-mannosidase activity when
expressed. Northern blot analysis identified a major 3-kb mRNA
transcript in all human tissues tested and a minor 3.6-kb mRNA
transcript in several adult tissues.

Nilssen et al. (1997) reported purification and characterization of
lysosomal alpha-mannosidase, which they symbolized LAMAN, from human
placenta. They found that the enzyme was synthesized as a single-chain
precursor which is processed into 3 glycopeptides of 70, 42, and 15 kD.
The 70-kD peptide is further partially proteolyzed into 3 more peptides
that are joined by disulfide bridges. The deduced amino acid sequence
contains a putative signal peptide of 48 amino acids followed by a
polypeptide sequence of 962 amino acids. Northern blot analysis revealed
a single transcript of approximately 3.5 kb present in all tissues
examined, but at varying levels.

Berg et al. (1997) reported the purification of feline liver lysosomal
alpha-mannosidase and determination of its cDNA sequence. The active
enzyme consists of 3 polypeptides, with molecular masses of 72, 41, and
12 kD, joined by noncovalent forces. They demonstrated that the enzyme
is synthesized as a single-chain precursor with a putative signal
peptide of 50 amino acids followed by a polypeptide chain of 957 amino
acids, which is cleaved into the 3 polypeptides of the mature enzyme.
The deduced amino acid sequence was 81.1% and 83.2% identical with the
human and bovine sequences, respectively. Tollersrud et al. (1997)
purified the bovine kidney enzyme to homogeneity and cloned the gene.

GENE STRUCTURE

Riise et al. (1997) determined that the MANB gene spans 21.5 kb and
contains 24 exons. By primer extension analysis, the major transcription
initiation sites were mapped to positions -309, -196, and -191 relative
to the first in-frame ATG. No CAAT or TATA sequences were identified
within the 134 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site, but the
5-prime flanking region contains several GC-rich regions with putative
binding sites for the transcription factors Sp1 (189906), AP-2 (107580),
and ETF.

MAPPING

By analysis of human-mouse hybrid cells, Kaneda et al. (1987) assigned
the MANB gene to chromosome 19p13.2-q12. By PCR analysis of DNA from 2
human/rodent somatic cell hybrid mapping panels, Nebes and Schmidt
(1994) mapped the MANB gene to the proximal portion of chromosome 19. In
combination with earlier findings, the gene could be mapped to
19cen-q12.

Beccari et al. (1996) mapped the mouse Man2b1 gene to chromosome 8 using
the Jackson Laboratory interspecific panel DNA.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 Palestinian sibs with alpha-mannosidosis (MANSA; 248500) originally
reported by Bach et al. (1978), Nilssen et al. (1997) identified a
homozygous mutation in the MAN2B1 gene (609458.0001).

In unrelated patients with alpha-mannosidosis, Gotoda et al. (1998)
identified 5 mutations in the MAN2B1 gene (609458.0001-609458.0005). All
mutations were either in the homozygous or compound heterozygous states.

In a screening of 43 patients with mannosidosis from 39 families, mainly
of European origin, Berg et al. (1999) identified 21 novel
disease-causing mutations in the MAN2B1 gene, and 4 polymorphic amino
acid variations. Disease-causing mutations were identified in 72% of the
patients' alleles and included 8 splicing, 6 missense, and 3 nonsense
mutations, as well as 2 small insertions and 2 small deletions. In
addition, Southern blot analysis indicated rearrangements in some
alleles. Most mutations were private or occurred in 2 or 3 families,
except for the R750W substitution (609458.0004), which was found in 13
patients from different European countries and accounted for 21% of the
disease alleles. No correlation between the types of mutations and the
clinical manifestations was evident.

Riise Stensland et al. (2012) identified 96 different pathogenic
mutations in the MAN2B1 gene, including 83 novel mutations, in 130
unrelated patients with alpha-mannosidosis from 30 countries. Most of
the mutations were private, but R750W was found in 50 patients from 16
countries and accounted for 27.3% of disease alleles. Haplotype analysis
indicated at least 4 independent events causing R750W, with 1 haplotype
accounting for 95% of the alleles. Population-based analysis suggested
that the mutant allele arose in eastern Europe. Other recurrent
mutations included a splice site mutation in intron 14 (609458.0006),
found in 13 disease alleles, and L809P (609458.0007), found in 8 disease
alleles. Twenty-nine novel missense mutations were identified. Most did
not show any residual enzyme activity when expressed in COS7 cells, but
10 showed some activity, including 5 with 30% or more residual activity.
There were no apparent genotype/phenotype correlations.

ANIMAL MODEL

Roces et al. (2004) reported correction of storage of neutral
oligosaccharides in a mouse model of alpha-mannosidosis after
intravenous administration of Man2b1 from bovine kidney and human and
mouse recombinant MAN2B1. The bovine and human enzymes were barely
phosphorylated, whereas the bulk of the mouse Man2b1 contained mannose
6-phosphate recognition markers. Clearance and apparent half-life of the
internalized enzyme was dependent on the enzyme source as well as tissue
type. The corrective effect was time-, tissue- and dose-dependent, and
the effects were observed to be transient. After a single dose injection
of MAN2B1, the maximum corrective effect was observed between 2 and 6
days. Injection of 250 microU of human MAN2B1 per gram of body weight
followed by a subsequent injection 3.5 days later was sufficient to
clear liver, kidney, and heart of neutral oligosaccharides. A decrease
in mannose-containing oligosaccharides was also observed in the brain,
with storage levels in treated mice less than 30% of levels found in
control mice.

Blanz et al. (2008) demonstrated that the neuropathology of a mouse
model for alpha-mannosidosis could be efficiently treated using
recombinant human alpha-mannosidase (rhLAMAN). After intravenous
administration of various doses (25-500 U/kg), rhLAMAN was widely
distributed among tissues, and immunohistochemistry revealed lysosomal
delivery of the injected enzyme. Whereas low doses (25 U/kg) led to a
greater than 70% clearance of stored substrates in visceral tissues and
doses of 250 U/kg were sufficient for clearance in peripheral neurons of
the trigeminal ganglion, repeated high-dose injections (500 U/kg) were
required to achieve a greater than 50% reduction of brain storage.
Successful transfer across the blood-brain barrier was evident as the
injected enzyme was found in hippocampal neurons, leading to nearly
complete disappearance of storage vacuoles. In addition, the decrease in
neuronal storage in the brain correlated with an improvement of the
neuromotor disabilities found in untreated alpha-mannosidosis mice.
Uptake of rhLAMAN seemed to be independent of mannose-6-phosphate
receptors, consistent with the low phosphorylation profile of the
enzyme.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ALPHA-MANNOSIDOSIS
MAN2B1, HIS71LEU

In 2 sibs with alpha-mannosidosis (MANSA; 248500), born of
consanguineous parents, Nilssen et al. (1997) identified a homozygous
212A-T transversion in exon 2 of the MANB gene, resulting in a
his71-to-leu (H71L) substitution. Residue his71 is conserved among
lysosomal alpha-mannosidases from several species. The sibs were thought
to be mildly affected and residual acidic alpha-mannosidase activity of
20% of normal was detected in the patient's fibroblasts, according to
the report of this family by Bach et al. (1978). Nevertheless, the
patients showed vacuolated leukocytes and fibroblasts consistent with
the disease phenotype. The authors suggested that mutant mannosidase
enzymes, even though containing residual activity upon testing at the
appropriate pH, may be mislocalized to nonlysosomal compartments and
therefore functionally inactive.

Gotoda et al. (1998) identified the same mutation, which they designated
HIS72LEU in keeping with the codon numbering system of Wakamatsu et al.
(1997). The patient, represented by cell line GM2051, was one of the
patients reported by Nilssen et al. (1997).

.0002
ALPHA-MANNOSIDOSIS
MAN2B1, ARG760TER

In a 47-year-old Japanese woman with mannosidosis (248500), born to
first-cousin parents, Gotoda et al. (1998) identified a homozygous
C-to-T transition in exon 19 of the MAN2B1 gene, resulting in an
arg760-to-ter (R760X) substitution. The lysosomal alpha-mannosidase
activity of the peripheral leukocytes was decreased to less than 1% of
control values.

.0003
ALPHA-MANNOSIDOSIS
MAN2B1, GLN639TER

In fibroblast cell lines from a 7-year-old Finnish boy with
alpha-mannosidosis (248500), who was originally described by Autio et
al. (1973), Gotoda et al. (1998) identified compound heterozygosity for
2 mutations in the MAN2B1 gene: a C-to-T transition in exon 15,
resulting in a gln639-to-ter (Q639X) substitution, and a C-to-T
transition in exon 18, resulting in an arg750-to-trp substitution
(R750W; 609458.0004). Alpha-mannosidase activity was reduced to
approximately 2% of normal.

.0004
ALPHA-MANNOSIDOSIS
MAN2B1, ARG750TRP

See 609458.0003 and Gotoda et al. (1998).

Berg et al. (1999) identified the arg750-to-trp (R750W) mutation in 13
patients with alpha-mannosidosis (248500) from different European
countries. R750W accounted for 21% of disease alleles.

Riise Stensland et al. (2012) identified the R750W mutation in 50 of 130
unrelated patients with alpha-mannosidosis from 30 countries. It was the
most common mutation, accounting for 27.3% of disease alleles. Haplotype
analysis indicated at least 4 independent events causing R750W, with 1
haplotype accounting for 95% of the alleles. Population-based analysis
suggested that the mutant allele arose in eastern Europe. The mutation
was found in patients with mild, moderate, and severe disease.

.0005
ALPHA-MANNOSIDOSIS
MAN2B1, PRO356ARG

In a fibroblast cell line from a 2-year-old girl with severe
alpha-mannosidosis (248500), Gotoda et al. (1998) identified a
homozygous C-to-T transversion in exon 8 of the MAN2B1 gene, resulting
in a pro356-to-arg (P356R) substitution. The patient showed severe
growth failure with hypotonia, psychomotor retardation, and
hepatosplenomegaly.

.0006
ALPHA-MANNOSIDOSIS
MAN2B1, IVS14DS, G-C, +1

In a study of 130 unrelated patients with alpha-mannosidosis (248500)
from 30 countries, Riise Stensland et al. (2012) found that a G-to-C
transversion in intron 14 (IVS14+1G-C) of the MAN2B1 gene (Berg et al.,
1999) was present on 13 disease alleles, making it the second most
common mutation after R750W (609458.0004).

.0007
ALPHA-MANNOSIDOSIS
MAN2B1, LEU809PRO

In a study of 130 unrelated patients with alpha-mannosidosis (248500)
from 30 countries, Riise Stensland et al. (2012) found that a 2426T-C
transition in exon 20 of the MAN2B1 gene (Berg et al., 1999) was present
on 8 disease alleles, making it the third most common mutation after
R750W (609458.0004) and a splice site mutation in intron 14
(609458.0006).

606442	TITLE *606442 ABL INTERACTOR 2; ABI2
;;ABL-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1; AIP1
DESCRIPTION The ABL protein (ABL1; 189980) is the cellular homolog of the Abl
oncogene product of Abelson murine leukemia virus. ABL is a tyrosine
kinase that may regulate signal transduction events in the cytoplasm and
processes in the nucleus. The transforming Abl proteins are
constitutively active tyrosine kinases primarily localized in the
cytoplasm. They are repressed by SH3 domains and possibly by other
regions.

CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a lymphocyte cDNA library with the ABL1
SH3 domain as bait, Dai and Pendergast (1995) isolated a cDNA encoding
ABI2. Sequence analysis predicted that the 401-amino acid ABI2 protein
is 65% identical to the Abi1 mouse protein and 70% identical to the frog
Xlan4 protein. ABI2 possesses a basic N terminus with homology to a
homeodomain protein; a central serine-rich region; 3 PEST sequences,
which are implicated in susceptibility to protein degradation; several
proline-rich stretches; and an acidic C terminus with multiple
phosphorylation sites and an SH3 domain. Northern blot analysis revealed
ubiquitous but variable expression of 7.0- and 1.9-kb ABI2 transcripts.
Binding and mutational analyses showed that the interaction between the
N-terminal proline-rich stretch of ABI2 and the ABL1 SH3 domain is
highly specific, but that the ABI2 SH3 domain also binds to a
proline-rich stretch downstream of the nuclear localization signal in
the ABL1 C terminus. Immunoblot and autoradiographic analyses indicated
that ABI2 is phosphorylated by ABL1. ABI2 mutants lacking the N-terminal
proline-rich ABL1 SH3 domain-binding residues activated the transforming
capacity of ABL1. Dai and Pendergast (1995) suggested that the ABI
proteins may function to coordinate the cytoplasmic and nuclear
functions of the ABL1 tyrosine kinase.

MAPPING

By analysis of a YAC and a BAC, Machado et al. (2000) mapped the ABI2
gene to 2q31-q33.

A hypothetical protein encoded by C. elegans chromosome III contains a

(600322)-like domain flanking a central region. Seroussi et al. (1998)
stated that several lines of evidence suggest that these 3 domains are
encoded by a polycistronic operon rather than a single gene. They
designated the central domain NIPSNAP to reflect its position between
the NIP- and SNAP25-like regions. By sequence analysis of cloned genomic
DNA from 22q12 and of ESTs corresponding to that region, Seroussi et al.
(1998) identified a novel human gene encoding a protein with strong
sequence similarity to NIPSNAP. The predicted 284-amino acid protein,
which they called NIPSNAP1, shares 94% sequence identity with the mouse
ortholog, Nipsnap1. Northern blot analysis revealed that NIPSNAP1 is
expressed ubiquitously as a 2.1-kb mRNA, with the highest level in
liver. The authors determined that the NIPSNAP1 gene contains 10 exons
and spans 26 kb.

Using RT-PCR, Schoeber et al. (2008) detected variable Nipsnap1
expression in all mouse tissues examined except spleen.
Immunohistochemical analysis of kidney sections detected Nipsnap1 in the
inner medulla collecting ducts. Coprecipitation, protein pull-down, and
functional assays showed that Nipsnap1 interacted with Trpv6 (606680)
and regulated its channel activity. Electrophysiologic recordings
revealed that Nipsnap1 abolished Trpv6 currents, but it did not alter
the membrane localization of Trpv6.

MAPPING

Seroussi et al. (1998) found that the NIPSNAP1 gene is located between
the NF2 (607379) and PK1.3 (THOC5; 612733) genes on chromosome 22q12.

610735	TITLE *610735 MYOZENIN 3; MYOZ3
;;CALSARCIN 3;;
FATZ-RELATED PROTEIN 3; FRP3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database analysis, followed by PCR of a human skeletal muscle cDNA
library, Frey and Olson (2002) cloned MYOZ3, which they called
calsarcin-3. The predicted 251-amino acid protein exhibits highest
homology to MYOZ1 (605603) and MYOZ2 (605602) at its N and C termini and
shares 75% identity with mouse Myoz3. Northern blot analysis of adult
human tissues revealed expression of a major 3.4-kb transcript, as well
as 2 other transcripts, in skeletal muscle only,

GENE FUNCTION

Frey and Olson (2002) showed that calsarcin-3 coimmunoprecipitated with
calcineurin (see 114105) and the Z disc proteins telethonin (TCAP;
604488), alpha-actinin-2 (ACTN2; 102573), and gamma-filamin (FLNC;
102565). Analysis of deletion mutants revealed 2 independent domains
that are sufficient to bind ACTN2, an N-terminal and a C-terminal
domain, with the former domain also required for calcineurin and
telethonin binding. A second N-terminal domain mediated binding to
gamma-filamin. By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, they showed that ZASP (LDB3;
605906) interacted strongly with all 3 calsarcins. Immunolocalization
experiments revealed a strong Z disc staining pattern in cryosections of
mouse hindlimb skeletal muscle, as indicated by colocalization with
alpha-actinin. Preferential expression of calsarcin-3 in fast-twitch
myofibers was observed using immunofluorescence. Frey and Olson (2002)
proposed that calsarcins may serve to crosslink Z disc proteins,
contributing to the formation and maintenance of the Z disc.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Frey and Olson (2002) mapped the MYOZ3
gene to chromosome 5q31.

GENE STRUCTURE

Frey and Olson (2002) determined that the MYOZ3 gene contains 7 exons
and spans approximately 19 kb.

612895	TITLE *612895 NUCLEOREDOXIN; NXN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Kurooka et al. (1997) cloned mouse nucleoredoxin from a neonatal skin
cDNA library. The deduced 435-amino acid protein is rich in acidic amino
acids, has an internal long direct repeat, and shares significant
similarity with thioredoxin (TXN; 187700). Northern blot analysis
detected several nucleoredoxin splice variants in adult mouse tissues,
with highest expression in testis and skin and lowest expression in
liver. In situ hybridization showed that expression of nucleoredoxin
varied during mouse embryonic development. Expression was widespread in
embryos at days 9.5 and 10.5, with expression in limb buds, somites,
dorsal root ganglia, branchial bars, and parts of the brain, but
expression was marginal at day 12.5. Epitope-tagged nucleoredoxin
localized to nuclei of transfected COS-7 cells. Southern blot analysis
detected nucleoredoxin orthologs in human, rat, and rabbit, but not in
frog, fly, nematode, and yeast.

GENE FUNCTION

Kurooka et al. (1997) showed that the recombinant C-terminal domain of
mouse nucleoredoxin had oxidoreductase activity toward the disulfide
bonds of insulin (INS; 176730), with kinetics similar to that of
purified E. coli thioredoxin. Deletion of 55 N-terminal amino acids from
the construct, including the putative redox active site, resulted in a
protein that failed to reduce insulin.

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the NXN gene to chromosome 17p13.3 based on an
alignment of the NXN sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF086523) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

Kurooka et al. (1997) mapped the mouse Nxn gene to chromosome 11.

603332	TITLE *603332 DYNEIN, AXONEMAL, HEAVY CHAIN 1; DNAH1
;;HL11;;
DNAHC1;;
HDHC7
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Dyneins are microtubule-associated motor protein complexes composed of
several heavy, light, and intermediate chains. The axonemal dyneins,
found in cilia and flagella, are components of the outer and inner
dynein arms attached to the peripheral microtubule doublets. See 603297.
Chapelin et al. (1997), Neesen et al. (1997), and Vaughan et al. (1996)
isolated partial cDNAs encoding a human dynein heavy chain (DHC) that
they designated DNAHC1, HDHC7, and HL-11, respectively. By sequence
analysis, Chapelin et al. (1997) determined that DNAHC1 belongs to the
putative axonemal inner dynein arm DHC group and is homologous to rat
DLP1. RT-PCR assays indicated that DNAHC1 is expressed primarily in
trachea and testis, 2 tissues containing axonemal structures.

Neesen et al. (1997) cloned partial cDNAs encoding Mdhc7, the mouse
DNAH1 homolog.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids, Chapelin et al. (1997) mapped the
human DNAHC1 gene to chromosome 3. Using fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Neesen et al. (1997) localized the HDHC7 gene to human
chromosome 3p21.3 and mouse chromosome 14, region B-C. These regions
share homology of synteny. Vaughan et al. (1996) confirmed the map
position of the mouse homolog using an interspecific backcross.

ANIMAL MODEL

Neesen et al. (2001) generated mice lacking the dynein heavy chain-7
(Mdhc7) gene. Both Mdhc7 +/- and Mdhc7 -/- mice were viable and showed
no malformations; however, homozygous males produced no offspring. In
comparison to spermatozoa of Mdhc7 +/- and wildtype mice, those of Mdhc7
-/- mice revealed a dramatically reduced straight line velocity and
progressive movement, resulting in the inability of Mdhc7-deficient
sperm to move from the uterus into the oviduct. Additionally, a
decreased beat frequency in tracheal cilia of 50% was observed in Mdhc7
-/- mice. The reduction in both ciliary and flagellar motility was not
correlated with any gross defects in the axonemal structure. The
phenotype of Mdhc7 -/- mice is similar to that observed in some patients
suffering from primary ciliary dyskinesia (see 244400), and the authors
suggested that mutations in DNAH1 may be responsible for PCD in some
patients.

611005	TITLE *611005 MEX3, C. ELEGANS, HOMOLOG OF, C; MEX3C
;;RING FINGER- AND KH DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; RKHD2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for genes in a region of chromosome 18 linked to essential
hypertension (HYT8; 611014), Guzman et al. (2006) identified RKHD2
(MEX3C). The deduced protein contains a RING-type zinc finger domain and
a ribonucleoprotein K (HNRNPK; 600712) homology (KH) domain. Microarray
data showed that RKHD2 was expressed in most tissues and cell lines
analyzed.

C. elegans Mex3 is a regulator of translation that specifies posterior
blastomere identity in the early embryo and contributes to the
maintenance of germline totipotency. By database analysis and RT-PCR,
Buchet-Poyau et al. (2007) cloned a family of 4 human genes homologous
to C. elegans Mex3, including MEX3C. Like the other human MEX3 proteins,
the deduced 659-amino acid MEX3C protein has an N-terminal nuclear
export signal (NES), 2 KH domains, and a C-terminal RING finger domain.
The KH domains are present in C. elegans Mex3, but not the RING domain.
MEX3C also has a C-terminal nuclear localization signal. RT-PCR detected
variable expression of MEX3C in human tissues and cell lines, with
highest expression in testis.

Jiao et al. (2012) cloned mouse Mex3c, which encodes a deduced 464-amino
acid protein with 2 KH domains and a C-terminal zinc finger domain.
Database analysis revealed a splice variant of Mex3c that encodes a
deduced 653-amino acid protein with an N-terminal extension compared
with the shorter isoform. Mex3c was expressed in mouse testis, ovary,
brain, lung, and developing tibia, with lower expression in other
internal organs. It was also expressed in resting and proliferating
chondrocytes,

GENE FUNCTION

Using Western blot analysis of transfected human embryonic kidney cells
and kinase assays, Buchet-Poyau et al. (2007) showed that MEX3A
(611007), MEX3B (611008), and MEX3C were phosphoproteins. RNA
homopolymer-binding assays and immunoprecipitation analysis revealed
that MEX3A, MEX3B, and MEX3C bound RNA via their KH domains in vitro and
in vivo. Immunofluorescence analysis of transfected breast cancer cells
showed that MEX3A, MEX3B, and MEX3C shuttled between the nucleus and
cytoplasm in an NES-dependent manner.

Jiao et al. (2012) showed that mouse Mex3c bound multiple mRNA species.

Burrell et al. (2013) found evidence for impaired replication fork
progression and increased DNA replication stress in cancer chromosomal
instability (CIN)+ colorectal cancer cells relative to CIN- colorectal
cancer cells, with structural chromosome abnormalities precipitating
chromosome missegregation in mitosis. Burrell et al. (2013) identified 3
CIN suppressor genes (PIGN, 606097; MEX3C; and ZNF516, 615114) encoded
on chromosome 18q that are subject to frequent copy number loss in CIN+
colorectal cancer cells. Chromosome 18q loss was temporally associated
with aneuploidy onset at the adenoma-carcinoma transition. CIN
suppressor gene silencing led to DNA replication stress, structural
chromosome abnormalities, and chromosome missegregation. Supplementing
cells with nucleosides, to alleviate replication-associated damage,
reduced the frequency of chromosome segregation errors after CIN
suppressor gene silencing, and attenuated segregation errors and DNA
damage in CIN+ cells. Burrell et al. (2013) concluded that their data
implicated a central role for replication stress in the generation of
structural and numerical CIN.

GENE STRUCTURE

Guzman et al. (2006) determined that the MEX3C gene contains 2 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Guzman et al. (2006) mapped the MEX3C gene
to chromosome 18q21.1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

For discussion of an association between variation in the MEX3C gene and
susceptibility to hypertension, see HYT8 (611014).

ANIMAL MODEL

Using a gene trap approach, Jiao et al. (2012) created mutant mice with
significant reduction in Mex3c expression. Homozygous gene trap mice
(tr/tr) showed about 2% residual Mex3c expression compared with
wildtype. Mex3c tr/tr embryos developed normally, but they showed
variable perinatal lethality depending on the genetic background. The
more susceptible Mex3c tr/tr strains died shortly after birth due to
respiratory distress, with poor expansion of alveolar spaces. More
resistant Mex3c tr/tr strains had a lower rate of mortality and were
fertile, but they were growth retarded and had reduced fat deposit,
likely due to elevated energy expenditure. Mex3c tr/tr mice had reduced
serum and bone Igf1 (147440) protein concentrations. Tissue Igf1 mRNA
content was normal, suggesting a defect in Igf1 translation in Mex3c
tr/tr mice.
