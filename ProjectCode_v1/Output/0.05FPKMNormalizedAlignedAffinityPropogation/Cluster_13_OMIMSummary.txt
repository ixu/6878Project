608879	TITLE *608879 VACUOLAR PROTEIN SORTING 13, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF, C; VPS13C
;;KIAA1421
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned VPS13C, which they designated
KIAA1421. The deduced protein contains 1,463 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected VPS13C expression in all adult and fetal tissues and all
specific brain regions examined. Expression was intermediate in most
tissues, but it was lower in adult pancreas and lung and in fetal liver
and brain.

By searching databases for sequences similar to VPS13A (605978),
followed by RT-PCR of lymphoid cell line and brain RNA, Velayos-Baeza et
al. (2004) cloned VPS13C. They identified 2 main splice variants,
variant 1A and variant 2A, as well as 4 different 3-prime end splice
variants. Variant 1A encodes a deduced 3,710-amino acid protein, and
variant 2A encodes a deduced 3,753-amino acid protein. VPS13C shares
significant similarity with yeast Vps13 and other human VPS13 proteins,
mostly in the N and C termini. Northern blot analysis detected
expression of variant 1A in all tissues tested, whereas variant 2A was
expressed only in brain, although at a higher level than variant 1A.

GENE STRUCTURE

Velayos-Baeza et al. (2004) determined that the VPS13C gene contains 86
exons, including 1 alternative exon (exon 81b), and spans 208 kb.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the VPS13C
gene to chromosome 15. By genomic sequence analysis, Velayos-Baeza et
al. (2004) mapped the VPS13C gene to chromosome 15q21.3. They mapped the
mouse Vps13c gene to chromosome 9C.
