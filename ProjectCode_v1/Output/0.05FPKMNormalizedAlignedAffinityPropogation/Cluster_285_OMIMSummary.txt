DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Raab-Graham et al. (1994) used low stringency colony hybridization with
the complete coding region of the mouse IRK gene (Kubo et al., 1993) to
isolate cDNA from human heart that encodes an inwardly rectifying
potassium channel, KCNJ2. Raab-Graham et al. (1994) symbolized the gene
HHIRK1. The cDNA encodes a 427-amino acid protein with 2 putative
transmembrane domains and an H5 region. Expression of HHIRK1 in Xenopus
oocytes demonstrated strong inward rectification that was blocked by
both extracellular barium and cesium ions, and they measured a single
channel conductance of 30 pS. Northern blot analysis demonstrated a
single 5.5-kb transcript with high levels in heart, brain, placenta,
lung, and skeletal muscle. Lower levels were present in kidney. The
HHIRK1 message was found in all brain subregions tested, particularly in
the caudate nucleus, corpus callosum, and substantia nigra. In regions
of sequence overlap, HHIRK1 shares 66 to 67% identity with a small
conductance human potassium channel (KCNJ4; 600504). Because of
similarities in channel properties, Raab-Graham et al. (1994) suggested
that HHIRK1 was the prominent cardiac inward rectifier.

GENE STRUCTURE

Derst et al. (2001) determined that the KCNJ2 gene contains 2 exons and
spans approximately 10 kb.

MAPPING

Raab-Graham et al. (1994) mapped the HHIRK1 gene to human chromosome 17
by PCR amplification from a somatic cell hybrid panel. This location is
consistent with the mapping of mouse IRK1 to a distal region of mouse
chromosome 11 that shares homology with human chromosome 17. (See also
KCNJ1, 600359).

By radiation hybrid analysis, electronic PCR, and sequence similarity to
mapped BACs, Derst et al. (2001) mapped the KCNJ2 gene to chromosome
17q23.1-q24.2, separated by 34 kb from KCNJ16 (605722).

GENE FUNCTION

Inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channels are important regulators of
resting membrane potential and cell excitability. The activity of Kir
channels is critically dependent on the integrity of channel
interactions with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). Using
targeted mutations in KCNJ2 and KCNJ1 (600359), which the authors called
Kir2.1 and Kir1.1, Lopes et al. (2002) identified residues important for
PIP2 interaction. Mutations in residues associated with Andersen
syndrome (170390) and Bartter syndrome (241200) decreased the strength
of channel-PIP2 interactions. Lopes et al. (2002) concluded that a
decrease in channel-PIP2 interactions underlies the molecular mechanism
of Andersen and Bartter syndromes when these mutations are present in
patients.

To gain insight into the mechanism of arrhythmia susceptibility,
Tristani-Firouzi et al. (2002) used a ventricular myocyte model to
simulate the effects of reduced Kir2.1. A reduction in Kir2.1 prolonged
the terminal phase of the cardiac action potential, and in the setting
of reduced extracellular potassium ion, induced delayed
afterdepolarizations and spontaneous arrhythmias. These findings
suggested that the substrate for arrhythmia susceptibility in Andersen
syndrome is distinct from that in the other forms of inherited long QT
syndrome.

Although chloroquine is an important therapeutic agent for treatment of
malaria, its safety margin is narrow. Chloroquine inhibits the cardiac
inward rectifier K+ current and can induce lethal ventricular
arrhythmias. Rodriguez-Menchaca et al. (2008) found that chloroquine
blocked mouse Kir2.1 channels from the cytoplasmic surface in a voltage-
and K(+)-dependent manner. Mutagenesis and molecular modeling showed
that chloroquine did not penetrate deeply into the channel and was
stabilized within the binding pocket by negatively charged and aromatic
amino acids.

Epshtein et al. (2009) noted that K(+) channel activation is suppressed
by elevated membrane cholesterol. By mutating specific residues in mouse
Kir2.1, they found that cholesterol sensitivity was due to a subset of
channel-activating PIP2-sensitive residues within the CD loop in the
C-terminal cytosolic domain. PIP2-sensitive residues outside this loop
and lipid-facing residues of the outer helix transmembrane domain were
not involved in cholesterol sensitivity. Mutations of the critical
residues did not interfere with Kir2.1-PIP2 interaction and did not
alter the targeting of Kir2.1 to specific membrane domains. Epshtein et
al. (2009) hypothesized that these residues may contribute to the
docking of the Kir2.1 C terminus to the inner membrane leaflet,
facilitating its interaction with membrane cholesterol, and possibly
stabilizing the channel in the closed conformation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

-  Andersen Cardiodysrhythmic Periodic Paralysis

Andersen syndrome is characterized by periodic paralysis, cardiac
arrhythmias, and dysmorphic features. Using 400 polymorphic markers
across the entire genome in 15 individuals of a kindred with Andersen
syndrome, Plaster et al. (2001) mapped the disease locus to 17q23
(maximum lod of 3.23 at theta of 0 for D17S949) near the KCNJ2 gene.
They identified heterozygosity for a missense mutation in the KCNJ2 gene
in the linked family and 8 additional heterozygous mutations in
unrelated patients. Expression of 2 of these mutations (D71V,
600681.0001, and R218W, 600681.0002) in Xenopus oocytes revealed loss of
function and a dominant-negative effect in KCNJ2 current as assayed by
voltage-clamp. Plaster et al. (2001) concluded that mutations in the
KCNJ2 gene cause Andersen syndrome, and the findings suggested that
KCNJ2 plays an important role in developmental signaling in addition to
its function in controlling cell excitability in skeletal muscle and
heart.

Tristani-Firouzi et al. (2002) identified 3 novel Andersen
syndrome-associated mutations in the KCNJ2 gene
(600681.0007-600681.0009) and presented extensive clinical and in vitro
electrophysiologic studies on a total of 17 kindreds with 10 different
mutations. All these mutations in KCNJ2 caused dominant-negative
suppression of Kir2.1 channel function. There was significant overlap in
the extent of dominant-negative effect as well as overlap in clinical
phenotype. LQT and ventricular arrhythmias were common in mutation
carriers. Unlike other forms of inherited LQTS, sudden death had not
been reported in Andersen syndrome.

Among 17 unrelated probands with clinical symptoms of Andersen syndrome,
Donaldson et al. (2003) identified 8 different mutations, including 6
novel mutations, in the KCNJ2 gene in 9 probands. Six probands possessed
mutations of residues implicated in binding membrane-associated PIP2.
Including previous reports, the authors determined that mutations in
PIP2-related residues accounted for disease in 18 of 29 (62%) reported
families with KCNJ2-related ATS. Donaldson et al. (2003) found no
phenotypic differences between patients with mutations in the
PIP2-related residues and those with mutations elsewhere in the gene.
The authors suggested that genetic heterogeneity likely exists for this
disorder.

Davies et al. (2005) identified 9 different pathogenic mutations in the
KCNJ2 gene, including 6 novel mutations, in 22 affected individuals from
11 unrelated families with Andersen-Tawil syndrome. In vitro functional
expression studies of 5 of the mutant proteins showed a
dominant-negative effect on the wildtype allele.

In 3 affected members of a family with Andersen syndrome, Lu et al.
(2006) identified heterozygosity for a missense mutation in the KCNJ2
gene (T75R; 600681.0011), located in the highly conserved cytoplasmic
N-terminal domain. In vitro studies revealed that the mutant channel was
nonfunctional, and T75R transgenic mice had bidirectional ventricular
tachycardia after induction and longer QT intervals.

Choi et al. (2007) identified 2 different heterozygous missense
mutations in the KCNJ2 gene in affected members of 2 Korean families
with Andersen-Tawil syndrome. The authors stated that this was the first
report of causative mutations in KCNJ2 in Korean ATS patients.

In 2 unrelated probands with periodic paralysis and cardiac
dysrhythmias, who were known to be negative for common CACNA1S and SCN4A
mutations causing hypokalemic periodic paralysis, Bendahhou et al.
(2007) identified heterozygosity for 2 different missense mutations in
the KCNJ2 gene (600681.0012 and 600681.0013, respectively). Bendahhou et
al. (2007) noted that except for a small chin in 1 proband, there were
no dysmorphic features in these families, and suggested that KCNJ2
should be screened in patients with periodic paralysis even when the
classic dysmorphic features of Andersen syndrome are not present.

- Short QT Syndrome 3

In a 5-year-old girl and her father with short QT syndrome-3 (SQT3;
609622), Priori et al. (2005) identified a missense mutation in the
KCNJ2 gene (600681.0010). Functional studies revealed a significant
increase in the outward component of the I-V relation of I(K1).

- Familial Atrial Fibrillation 9

In affected members of a Chinese family segregating autosomal dominant
atrial fibrillation (ATFB9; 613980), Xia et al. (2005) identified
heterozygosity for a mutation in the KCNJ2 gene (V93I; 600681.0014).
Functional analysis revealed that the V93I mutation has a
gain-of-function effect on the Kir2.1 current, in contrast to the loss
of function observed with previously reported KCNJ2 mutations associated
with the Andersen periodic paralysis syndrome.

- Associations Pending Confirmation

KCNJ2 gene and susceptibility to thyrotoxic periodic paralysis, see
TTPP3 (614834).

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Doyle et al. (1998) determined the atomic structure of a bacterial
potassium channel pore by means of x-ray crystallography. However,
serious doubts were raised concerning whether the prokaryotic potassium
channel pore actually represents those of eukaryotes. Lu et al. (2001)
addressed this issue by substituting the prokaryotic potassium channel
pore into eukaryotic voltage-gated (see 176260) and inward-rectifier
potassium channels. The resulting chimeras retained the respective
functional hallmarks of the eukaryotic channels, which indicates that
the ion conduction pore is indeed conserved among potassium channels.

Preisig-Muller et al. (2002) demonstrated that heteromerization of
Kir2.1 channels with wildtype Kir2.2 and Kir2.3 channels contributes to
the phenotype of Andersen syndrome. Coexpression of Kir2.1 mutants
related to Andersen syndrome with wildtype Kir2.x channels showed a
dominant negative effect, the extent of which varied between different
mutants. The results suggested that differential tetramerization of the
mutant allele of Kir2.1 with wildtype Kir2.1, Kir2.2, and Kir2.3
channels represents the molecular basis of the extraordinary pleiotropy
and variability of Andersen syndrome. In addition to cardiac arrhythmias
and periodic paralysis, dysmorphic features include scoliosis, low-set
ears, wide-set eyes, small chin, and broad forehead, but expression of
these traits is highly variable.

Miake et al. (2002) replaced 3 amino acid residues in the pore structure
of Kir2.1 with alanine to create a dominant-negative construct that
suppresses current when expressed with wildtype Kir2.1. When this
construct was packaged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) into a
bicistronic adenoviral vector and injected into the left ventricular
cavity of guinea pigs during transient cross-clamping of the great
vessels, transduction was successful in about 20% of ventricular
myocytes, as determined by GFP fluorescence. This suppression of Kir2.1
converted quiescent heart muscle cells into pacemaker cells that
successfully generated a spontaneous rhythmic electrical activity in the
ventricle in vivo. Miake et al. (2002) concluded that genetically
engineered pacemakers could be developed as a possible alternative to
implantable electronic devices.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ANDERSEN CARDIODYSRHYTHMIC PERIODIC PARALYSIS
KCNJ2, ASP71VAL

In the affected individuals of a pedigree (K4415) with Andersen syndrome
(LQT7; 170390), Plaster et al. (2001) identified a heterozygous
(dominant) mutation in the KCNJ2 gene. The A-to-T transversion at
nucleotide 440 resulted in an asp71-to-val substitution in the N
terminus of the KCNJ2 protein. The mutation was not found in 100
unaffected and unrelated individuals. Expression of this mutation in
Xenopus oocytes revealed loss of function and a dominant-negative effect
in KCNJ2 current as assayed by voltage-clamp.

.0002
ANDERSEN CARDIODYSRHYTHMIC PERIODIC PARALYSIS
KCNJ2, ARG218TRP

In the affected individuals of 4 different pedigrees (K2679, K6515,
K2681, and K2401) with Andersen syndrome (LQT7; 170390), Plaster et al.
(2001) identified a heterozygous (dominant) mutation in the KCNJ2 gene.
The C-to-T transition at nucleotide 880 resulted in an arg218-to-trp
(R218W) substitution within the C-terminal interaction domain of the
KCNJ2 protein. The mutation occurred de novo in 3 pedigrees, and it was
not found in 100 unaffected and unrelated individuals. Expression of
this mutation in Xenopus oocytes revealed loss of function and a
dominant-negative effect in KCNJ2 current as assayed by voltage-clamp.

.0003
ANDERSEN CARDIODYSRHYTHMIC PERIODIC PARALYSIS
KCNJ2, GLY300VAL

In the affected individuals of 2 different pedigrees (K3677 and K3387)
with Andersen syndrome (LQT7; 170390), Plaster et al. (2001) identified
a heterozygous (dominant) mutation in the KCNJ2 gene. The G-to-T
transversion at nucleotide 1127 resulted in a gly300-to-val
substitution. This mutation was not found in 100 unaffected and
unrelated individuals.

.0004
ANDERSEN CARDIODYSRHYTHMIC PERIODIC PARALYSIS
KCNJ2, 12-BP DEL, NT513

In an affected individual of a pedigree (K2281) with Andersen syndrome
(LQT7; 170390), Plaster et al. (2001) identified a heterozygous
(dominant) in-frame deletion of 12 nucleotides in the KCNJ2 gene,
resulting in the deletion of amino acids 95 to 98 in the M1
transmembrane segment. This mutation was not found in 100 unaffected and
unrelated individuals.

.0005
ANDERSEN CARDIODYSRHYTHMIC PERIODIC PARALYSIS
KCNJ2, 6-BP DEL, NT1167

In an affected individual of a pedigree (K5768) with Andersen syndrome
(LQT7; 170390), Plaster et al. (2001) identified a heterozygous
(dominant) in-frame deletion of 6 nucleotides in the KCNJ2 gene,
resulting in the deletion of amino acids 314 to 315. This mutation
occurred de novo in this family and was not found in 100 unaffected and
unrelated individuals.

.0006
ANDERSEN CARDIODYSRHYTHMIC PERIODIC PARALYSIS
KCNJ2, ARG67TRP

See Andersen cardiodysrhythmic periodic paralysis (LQT7; 170390).
Andelfinger et al. (2002) identified a heterozygous missense mutation
(arg67 to trp; R67W) in the KCNJ2 gene in 41 members of a kindred with
ventricular arrhythmias (13 of 16 female members, 81%) and periodic
paralysis (10 of 25 male members, 40%) segregating as autosomal dominant
traits with sex-specific variable expressivity. Some mutation carriers
exhibited dysmorphic features, including hypertelorism, small mandible,
syndactyly, clinodactyly, cleft palate, and scoliosis, which, together
with cardiodysrhythmic periodic paralysis, constitute Andersen syndrome
(170390). However, no individual exhibited all manifestations of
Andersen syndrome, and this diagnosis was not considered in the proband
until other family members were examined. Other features seen in this
kindred included unilateral dysplastic kidney and cardiovascular
malformation (i.e., bicuspid aortic valve, bicuspid aortic valve with
coarctation of the aorta, or valvular pulmonary stenosis), which had not
previously been associated with Andersen syndrome. Nonspecific
electrocardiographic abnormalities were identified in some individuals,
but none had a prolonged QT interval.

Andelfinger et al. (2002) stated that sex specificity of cardiac
arrhythmias and periodic paralysis had not previously been described in
Andersen syndrome. However, there had been an increasing recognition of
specific electrocardiographic and electrophysiologic differences--for
example, resting heart rate and corrected QT intervals--between males
and females, but the precise way in which sex and gonadal steroids
contribute to these differences was not known (Pham and Rosen, 2002;
Wolbrette et al., 2002). Female subjects with the R67W mutation
typically noted onset of ventricular arrhythmia after age 10 years. An
increased incidence is usually reported during pregnancy, but female
subjects with R67W reported reduced ventricular arrhythmias during
pregnancy and after age 55 years, coinciding with menopause.

.0007
ANDERSEN CARDIODYSRHYTHMIC PERIODIC PARALYSIS
KCNJ2, PRO186LEU

In a kindred with Andersen syndrome (LQT7; 170390), Tristani-Firouzi et
al. (2002) identified a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 785 of the KCNJ2
gene, which resulted in a pro186-to-leu (P186L) amino acid substitution.
This mutation alters an amino acid of a PKKR motif (amino acids
186-189), a C-terminal motif implicated in binding the signaling
phospholipid PIP2.

.0008
ANDERSEN CARDIODYSRHYTHMIC PERIODIC PARALYSIS
KCNJ2, VAL302MET

In a kindred with Andersen syndrome (LQT7; 170390), Tristani-Firouzi et
al. (2002) found a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 1132 of the KCNJ2
gene, resulting in a val302-to-met (V302M) amino acid change. This
mutation lies in a C-terminal region that may be responsible for channel
subunit assembly.

.0009
ANDERSEN CARDIODYSRHYTHMIC PERIODIC PARALYSIS
KCNJ2, ASN216HIS

In a kindred with Andersen syndrome (LQT7; 170390), Tristani-Firouzi et
al. (2002) identified an A-to-C transversion at nucleotide 874 of the
KCNJ2 gene, which resulted in an asn261-to-his (N216H) amino acid
change. This mutation lies within a C-terminal region (amino acids
207-246) thought to be involved in PIP2 interactions.

.0010
SHORT QT SYNDROME 3
KCNJ2, ASP172ASN

In a 5-year-old girl and her father with short QT syndrome-3 (SQT3;
609622), Priori et al. (2005) identified a 514G-A transition in the
KCNJ2 gene, resulting in an asp172-to-asn (D172N) substitution. The
mutation was not found in unaffected family members. Functional studies
revealed a significant increase in the outward component of the I-V
relation of I(K1).

.0011
ANDERSEN CARDIODYSRHYTHMIC PERIODIC PARALYSIS
KCNJ2, THR75ARG

In 3 affected members of a family with Andersen syndrome (LQT7; 170390),
Lu et al. (2006) identified heterozygosity for a 224C-G transversion,
resulting in a thr75-to-arg (T75R) substitution at a highly conserved
codon in the cytoplasmic N-terminal portion of Kir2.1. The mutation was
not found in 2 unaffected family members or in 100 unrelated controls.
Although the mutant protein was able to coassemble and traffic to the
cell membrane in mouse atrial cardiomyocytes, voltage clamp analysis in
Xenopus oocytes revealed that the mutant channel was nonfunctional; upon
coexpression of mutant and wildtype cRNA in Xenopus oocytes, the K(+)
current was completely lost, demonstrating the strong dominant-negative
effect of the T75R mutant. Transgenic T75R mice had bidirectional
ventricular tachycardia after induction and longer QT intervals.

.0012
ANDERSEN CARDIODYSRHYTHMIC PERIODIC PARALYSIS
KCNJ2, CYS54PHE

In a 19-year-old man with periodic paralysis and cardiac dysrhythmias
(170390), triggered by use of corticosteroids on at least 2 occasions,
Bendahhou et al. (2007) identified heterozygosity for a 489G-T
transversion in the KCNJ2 gene, resulting in a cys54-to-phe (C54F)
substitution at a conserved residue in the N terminus. Functional
expression in mammalian cells revealed loss of function when the mutant
was expressed alone and a dominant-negative effect when expressed with
wildtype channels; however, channel trafficking and assembly were not
affected. The proband's unaffected brother and father also carried the
mutation. Aside from a small chin in the proband, there were no
dysmorphic features in this family.

.0013
ANDERSEN CARDIODYSRHYTHMIC PERIODIC PARALYSIS
KCNJ2, THR305PRO

In a 23-year-old woman with periodic paralysis and cardiac dysrhythmias
that began in childhood (170390), Bendahhou et al. (2007) identified
heterozygosity for a 1141A-C transversion in the KCNJ2 gene, resulting
in a thr305-to-pro (T305P) substitution at a conserved residue in the C
terminus. Functional expression in mammalian cells revealed loss of
function when the mutant was expressed alone and a dominant-negative
effect when expressed with wildtype channels; however, channel
trafficking and assembly were not affected. There were no dysmorphic
features in the proband. Her mother, maternal aunt, and maternal
grandmother had a history of cardiac dysrhythmias, and the grandmother
had a pacemaker.

.0014
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, FAMILIAL, 9
KCNJ2, VAL93ILE

In affected members of a Chinese family with atrial fibrillation (ATFB9;
613980), Xia et al. (2005) identified heterozygosity for a 227G-A
transition in the KCNJ2 gene, resulting in a val93-to-ile (V93I)
substitution at a highly conserved residue. The mutation was not found
in 420 controls. Patch-clamp studies in COS-7 and HEK293 cells
demonstrated that the V93I mutation has a gain-of-function effect on
Kir2.1 channels.

603369	TITLE *603369 CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE INHIBITOR 2C; CDKN2C
;;p18(INK4C)
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) are a group of low molecular
weight proteins that associate with cyclin-CDK complexes or CDKs alone
and inhibit their activity. Members of the INK4 family of CKIs, which
includes CDKN2C, specifically bind and inhibit CDK4 (123829) and CDK6
(603368), thereby preventing cyclin D-dependent phosphorylation of RB1
(614041). See INK4D (600947).

CLONING

By using a yeast 2-hybrid screen to search for CDK6-interacting
proteins, Guan et al. (1994) isolated a partial cDNA encoding a protein
that they designated p18 based on its molecular mass of 18 kD. They used
the partial cDNA to screen a HeLa cell library and recovered additional
cDNAs corresponding to the entire p18 coding region. Sequence analysis
revealed that the predicted 168-amino acid p18 protein shares 38% and
42% sequence identity with p16/INK4A (600160) and p14/INK4B (600431),
respectively. Like p14 and p16, p18 contains an ankyrin repeat domain.
Using Northern blot analysis, Guan et al. (1994) found that p18 is
expressed as multiple transcripts in various human tissues, with the
strongest expression in skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Guan et al. (1994) showed that, both in vivo and in vitro, p18
interacted strongly with CDK6 and weakly with CDK4, but not with the
other CDKs tested. Recombinant p18 inhibited the kinase activity of
cyclin D-CDK6 in vitro. Ectopic expression of either p16 or p18
suppressed the growth of human cells in a manner that appears to
correlate with the presence of a wildtype RB1 function.

GENE STRUCTURE

Blais et al. (1998) determined that the p18, or INK4C, gene contains 3
exons and spans more than 7.5 kb.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Guan et al. (1994) mapped the p18
gene to 1p32, a chromosomal region associated with abnormalities in a
variety of human tumors.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Lapointe et al. (1996) identified a single amino acid substitution
(ala72 to pro; A72P) in BT-20 human breast cancer cells that abrogated
the ability of p18 to interact with CDK6 and to suppress cell growth.
These authors suggested that p18 inactivation by point mutations may
contribute to deregulated growth control in certain cell lines and/or
tumors. Blais et al. (1998) found this p18 variant in 3 of 35 breast
tumors examined, and suggested that it may be a polymorphism.

ANIMAL MODEL

Zindy et al. (2001) determined that both Ink4c and Ink4d were expressed
in the seminiferous tubules of postnatal wildtype mice, being largely
confined to postmitotic spermatocytes undergoing meiosis. Loss of either
Ink4c or Ink4d alone was associated with male fertility, but
double-knockout males were sterile. Spermatogonia did not differentiate
properly and became apoptotic. Residual spermatozoa had reduced motility
and decreased viability. Loss of Ink4c alone or in combination with loss
of Ink4d was associated with impaired differentiation of Leydig cells
and reduced testosterone levels, but there was no effect on the levels
of luteinizing hormone produced by the anterior pituitary. Loss of Ink4c
or Ink4d, either singly or in combination, had no effect on female
reproductive function.

Bai et al. (2003) noted that targeted disruption of Ink4c in mice leads
to spontaneous pituitary tumors and lymphomas later in life. Treatment
of Inc4c null and heterozygous mice with a chemical carcinogen resulted
in tumor development at an accelerated rate. Bai et al. (2003) concluded
that, since the remaining wildtype allele of Ink4c was neither mutated
nor silenced in tumors derived from heterozygotes, Ink4c is a
haploinsufficient tumor suppressor in mice.

Using reconstituted mice with p18-deficient hematopoietic cells and in
vivo evaluation of stem cell function, Yuan et al. (2004) found that p18
inhibited cell division in hematopoietic stem cells and early
hematopoietic progenitor cells.

Nmyc (164840) promotes rapid cell division of granule neuron progenitors
(GNPs) in mice, and its conditional loss during embryonic cerebellar
development results in severe GNP deficiency, perturbs foliation, and
leads to reduced cerebellar mass. Since Nmyc loss triggers precocious
expression of Kip1 (CDKN1B; 600778) and Ink4c in the cerebellar
primordium, Zindy et al. (2006) disrupted Kip1 and Ink4c in Nmyc-null
cerebella and found that this partially rescued GNP cell proliferation
and cerebellar foliation. They concluded that expression of NMYC and
concomitant downregulation of INK4C and KIP1 contribute to the proper
development of the cerebellum.

600411	TITLE *600411 GUANYLATE-BINDING PROTEIN 1, INTERFERON-INDUCIBLE, 67-KD; GBP1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Interferons are cytokines that have antiviral effects and inhibit tumor
cell proliferation. They induce a large number of genes in their target
cells, including those coding for guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs).
GBPs, such as GBP1, are characterized by their ability to specifically
bind guanine nucleotides (GMP, GDP, and GTP) and are distinguished from
the GTP-binding proteins by the presence of 2 binding motifs rather than
3 (Cheng et al., 1991).

CLONING

Cheng et al. (1991) cloned cDNAs for GBP1 (a 67-kD protein) and GBP2
(600412).

Olszewski et al. (2006) reported that the 593-amino acid GBP1 protein
shares 77% and 88% identity with GBP2 and GBP3 (600431), respectively.
All GBPs, including GBP1, have a conserved N-terminal globular
GTP-binding domain containing 2 consensus sequences and a third T(L/V)RD
sequence not found in other GTPases. GBP1, GBP2, and GBP5 (611467)
contain a C-terminal CaaX isoprenylation motif. EST database analysis
showed wide expression of GBP1 in human tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

The putative window of embryo implantation in the human opens between
days 19 to 24 of the menstrual cycle. A major challenge in the study of
human reproduction is to identify the molecular signals that participate
in the establishment of this critical receptive phase in the context of
the natural cycle. Toward this goal, Kumar et al. (2001) analyzed human
endometrial biopsies at various days of the menstrual cycle by mRNA
differential display. They isolated several cDNAs representing genes
that are either up- or downregulated within the putative window of
implantation. They identified one of these genes as GBP1, which
possesses GTPase activity. Analysis of endometrial biopsies by Northern
blot and RT-PCR demonstrated that GBP1 mRNA is specifically induced at
the midsecretory phase of the menstrual cycle. In situ hybridization
analysis revealed that GBP1 mRNA expression is localized in the
glandular epithelial cells as well as in the stroma in the immediate
vicinity of the glands. The authors concluded that its unique expression
overlapping the putative window of implantation suggests that GBP1 may
serve as a useful marker of uterine receptivity in the human.

Using RT-PCR, Tripal et al. (2007) detected high expression of GBP1,
GBP2, and GBP3 in endothelial cells after stimulation with IFNG
(147570), TNF (191160), or IL1B (147720). Immunofluorescence analysis
demonstrated cytoplasmic expression of GBP1. In the presence of aluminum
fluoride, IFNG induced translocation of GBP1 to the Golgi apparatus.

Kim et al. (2011) examined a complete mouse 65-kD guanylate-binding
protein (Gbp) gene family as part of a 43-member
interferon-gamma-inducible guanosine triphosphatase superfamily in mouse
and human genomes. Family-wide loss of function analysis found that at
least 4 Gbps--Gbp1 (see 600412), Gbp6, Gbp7 (612468), and
Gbp10--conferred cell-autonomous immunity to listerial or mycobacterial
infection within macrophages and gene-deficient animals. These Gbps
solicited host defense proteins, including the phagocyte oxidase,
antimicrobial peptides, and autophagy effectors, to kill intracellular
bacteria. Thus, Kim et al. (2011) concluded that specific 65-kD Gbps
coordinate a potent oxidative and vesicular trafficking program to
protect the host from infection.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Ghosh et al. (2006) found that the isolated N-terminal G domain of GBP1
retained the main enzymatic properties of the full-length protein and
cleaved GDP. Crystal structures of the N-terminal G domain and
biochemical data revealed that, like other GTP-binding proteins,
homodimerization of GBP1 is regulated by structural changes in the
switch region. Homodimerization generates a conformation in which arg48
of the P loop and ser73 are oriented for efficient catalysis.
Positioning of the substrate for the second hydrolysis step is achieved
by a change in nucleotide conformation at the ribose that keeps the
guanine base interactions intact and positions the beta-phosphates in
the gamma-phosphate-binding site.

GENE STRUCTURE

Strehlow et al. (1994) identified the human GBP1 gene and showed that it
contains 11 exons. Olszewski et al. (2006) determined that, like other
GBPs, the GBP1 gene contains 11 exons and begins translation in exon 2.

MAPPING

By use of somatic cell hybrid DNAS, Strehlow et al. (1994) mapped the
GBP1 gene to chromosome 1. By genomic sequence analysis, Olszewski et
al. (2006) mapped the GBP1 gene to the GBP gene cluster on chromosome
1p22.2. It is located telomeric to GBP2 and centromeric to GBP3.

A mouse homolog of GBP1 has been mapped to the distal region of mouse
chromosome 3 (Prochazka et al., 1985).

;;FGFR1 ONCOGENE PARTNER; FOP
FOP/FGFR1 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using 5-prime RACE with FGFR1 primers on t(6;8) malignant cell cDNA,
followed by database searches, Popovici et al. (1999) isolated a cDNA
encoding FOP from a PAC localized on 6q27. The deduced 399-amino acid,
hydrophilic FOP protein has N- and C-terminal alpha helices harboring
leucine-rich repeats. Popovici et al. (1999) identified additional cDNAs
encoding a variant 331-amino acid protein, in which exon 11 is not
spliced out, resulting in a truncation due to an in-frame stop codon.
EST database searches suggested that FOP may be a member of a novel gene
family. Northern blot analysis detected ubiquitous expression of major
FOP transcripts of 1.2 and 1.7 kb. Highest expression, with an
additional 3.0-kb transcript, was found in heart. RT-PCR analysis
detected expression in hematopoietic cells and various malignant cell
lines.

- FOP-FGFR1 Fusion Gene

The 8p11 myeloproliferative disorder (613523) is caused by
translocations involving the tyrosine kinase-bearing FGFR1 gene (136350)
on chromosome 8p11 and various partner genes. Using RT-PCR, Popovici et
al. (1999) detected both FGFR1-FOP and FOP-FGFR1 fusion transcripts,
with the break occurring in intron 8 of FGFR1 or intron 6 of FOP, in 2
patients with the disorder but not in normal subjects or those with
other tumors.

GENE STRUCTURE

Popovici et al. (1999) determined that the FOP gene contains 13 exons
and spans more than 40 kb.

606233	TITLE *606233 PROKINETICIN 1; PROK1
;;PK1; PRK1;;
ENDOCRINE GLAND-DERIVED VASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH FACTOR; EG-VEGF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Endocrine gland-derived vascular endothelial growth factor (EG-VEGF)
induces proliferation, migration, and fenestration in capillary
endothelial cells derived from endocrine glands. Its expression is
induced by hypoxia and is restricted to the steroidogenic glands (ovary,
testis, adrenal, and placenta). Its expression is often complementary to
the expression of VEGF (192240), suggesting that these molecules
function in a coordinated manner.

CLONING

LeCouter et al. (2001) screened a library of purified human secreted
proteins for the ability to induce proliferation in primary bovine
adrenal cortex-derived capillary endothelial cells. EG-VEGF was capable
of inducing a strong and reproducible mitogenic response. Mature EG-VEGF
is a protein with a relative molecular mass of 8,600 encoded by a cDNA
cloned from human ovary library. The 1.4-kb cDNA encodes a protein of
105 amino acids with a well defined signal sequence. The mature protein
is predicted to have 86 amino acids, including 10 cysteines, and an
expected isoelectric point of 8.46. These cysteines potentially form 5
disulfide bridges. EG-VEGF displays a high degree of homology to a
nontoxic protein purified from the venom of the black mamba snake, venom
protein A (VPRA). The structure of native VPRA was solved, and the
disulfide bridge partners were revealed. The number and spacing of
cysteines are completely conserved between VPRA and EG-VEGF. BV8, a
human molecule closely related to a peptide isolated from the
yellow-bellied toad, is 58% identical to the EG-VEGF mature protein.
There is also significant homology to the carboxy-terminal sequence of
Xenopus dickkopf (see 605189) and to colipase (120105).

Li et al. (2001) identified EG-VEGF as prokineticin-1.

GENE FUNCTION

EG-VEGF is mitogenic and chemoattractive and able to induce
fenestration. EG-VEGF expression is induced by hypoxia, and there is an
HIF1 (603348) binding site present on EG-VEGF. EG-VEGF is able to induce
angiogenesis and ovarian cyst formation. Northern blot analysis
demonstrated expression in testis, ovary, adrenal gland, and placenta. A
signal was detectable in prostate after prolonged exposure.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PROK1
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP SHGC-16135).

608213	TITLE *608213 CELL CYCLE EXIT AND NEURONAL DIFFERENTIATION 1; CEND1
;;BM88 ANTIGEN; BM88
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to porcine Bm88,
Gaitanou et al. (2001) identified several ESTs for BM88 from an infant
brain cDNA library, and they cloned the cDNA by PCR. The deduced
149-amino acid BM88 protein has a calculated molecular mass of about 15
kD. It has a central proline-rich region containing 4 PxxP motifs, which
typically bind SRC (190090) homology-3 (SH3) domains, a putative
C-terminal transmembrane region, and several potential sites for
N-glycosylation, myristoylation, and phosphorylation. BM88 shares 79.9%
and 76.4% amino acid identity with mouse and porcine Bm88, respectively.
Northern blot analysis detected a 1.8-kb transcript expressed in mouse
and human whole brain and in all specific human brain regions examined.
Much less BM88 was expressed in spinal cord, and no expression was
detected in HeLa cells. Western blot analysis determined that the BM88
protein has an apparent molecular mass of about 23 kD. Following
nonreducing SDS-PAGE, the apparent molecular mass was about 46 kD,
suggesting that, like the porcine homolog, BM88 forms a dimer of 2
identical polypeptides linked by disulfide bridges. Immunofluorescence
localization of BM88 in transfected COS-7 cells revealed a punctate
staining pattern consistent with mitochondrial and vesicular
localization. Immunohistochemical staining of human cerebellum revealed
strong immunoreactivity in the molecular layer, the Purkinje cell layer,
and in granule neurons of the internal granular layer, but white matter
remained largely unstained.

Politis et al. (2007) showed that forced expression of BM88 in the
neural tube of chicken embryos had a strong antiproliferative effect,
causing neural precursors to prematurely exit the cell cycle and commit
to specific differentiation pathways. Conversely, downregulation of Bm88
by small interfering RNA in mouse spinal cord neural progenitor cells
enhanced proliferation and impaired neuronal differentiation. Politis et
al. (2007) concluded that BM88 is involved in synchronization of cell
cycle exit and differentiation of neuronal precursors in the developing
nervous system.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis and by FISH, Gaitanou et al. (2001) mapped

602360	TITLE *602360 L-ARGININE:GLYCINE AMIDINOTRANSFERASE; GATM
;;AGAT
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Creatine and phosphocreatine play important roles in the energy
metabolism of muscle and nerve tissues. The enzyme L-arginine:glycine
amidinotransferase (AGAT; EC 2.1.4.1) catalyzes the transfer of a
guanido group from arginine to glycine, forming guanidinoacetic acid,
the immediate precursor of creatine. One of the major sites of creatine
biosynthesis is the kidney. Humm et al. (1994) isolated and sequenced
AGAT from pig kidney mitochondria. Sequence data from the pig AGAT
polypeptide allowed them to isolate cDNA clones encoding the human
enzyme from a kidney carcinoma cDNA library. The largest human cDNA
sequence encodes a 423-amino acid polypeptide including a 37-amino acid
signal sequence. The mature porcine and human proteins are 94% identical
to each other and 36% identical to bacterial L-arginine:inosamine
phosphate amidinotransferase. Humm et al. (1997) noted that
mitochondrial and cytosolic forms of AGAT are believed to derive from
the same gene by alternative splicing. They expressed human AGAT in E.
coli and identified its active-site cysteine residue (cys407).

GENE STRUCTURE

Item et al. (2001) stated that the AGAT genomic DNA is 16,858 bp long
and contains 9 exons.

MAPPING

Item et al. (2001) stated that the human AGAT gene is located on
chromosome 15q15.3

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 sisters with cerebral creatine deficiency syndrome-3 (CCDS3;
612718) reported by Bianchi et al. (2000), Item et al. (2001) identified
a homozygous trp149-to-ter mutation in the GATM gene (W149X;
602360.0001), resulting in undetectable cDNA, as investigated by RT-PCR,
as well as in undetectable AGAT activity, as investigated
radiochemically in cultivated skin fibroblasts and in virus-transformed
lymphoblasts of the patients. The parents were heterozygous for the
mutant allele, with intermediate residual AGAT activities. In an
affected male cousin of the sibs reported by Bianchi et al. (2000),
Battini et al. (2002) identified homozygosity for the same W149X
mutation.

In 2 sibs, born of unrelated Yemenite Jewish parents, with cerebral
creatine deficiency syndrome-3, Edvardson et al. (2010) identified a
homozygous truncating mutation in the GATM gene (602360.0002).

ANIMAL MODEL

Sandell et al. (2003) demonstrated in the mouse that Gatm, which is
expressed during development, is imprinted in the placenta and yolk sac,
but not in embryonic tissues. The Gatm gene maps to mouse chromosome 2
in a region that had not previously been shown to contain imprinted
genes. To determine whether Gatm is located in a cluster of imprinted
genes, Sandell et al. (2003) investigated the expression pattern of
genes located near Gatm: Duox1 (606758), Duox2 (606759), Slc28a2
(606208), Slc30a4 (602095), and a transcript corresponding to LOC214616
and found no evidence that any is imprinted in placenta. These data were
the first to link creatine metabolism with imprinting and the parental
'tug-of-war' for energy resources during development. Although many
imprinted genes are associated with differentially methylated CpG
islands, the Gatm gene resides in apparent isolation from other
imprinted genes and is associated with an unmethylated CpG island.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CEREBRAL CREATINE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME 3
GATM, TRP149TER

In 2 sisters with cerebral creatine deficiency syndrome-3 (CCDS3;
612718) reported by Bianchi et al. (2000), Item et al. (2001) identified
a homozygous 9297G-A transition, converting a tryptophan codon (TGG) to
a stop codon (TAG) at residue 149 (W149X) of the GATM gene.

In an affected cousin of the sibs reported by Bianchi et al. (2000),
Battini et al. (2002) identified homozygosity for the same W149X
mutation; his parents and 10 additional subjects in the pedigree were
heterozygous for the mutation.

.0002
CEREBRAL CREATINE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME 3
GATM, 1-BP INS, 1111A

In 2 sibs, born of unrelated Yemenite Jewish parents, with cerebral
creatine deficiency syndrome-3 (612718), Edvardson et al. (2010)
identified a homozygous 1-bp insertion (1111insA) in the GATM gene,
resulting in a frameshift and premature termination at codon 376. Each
unaffected parent was heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found
in 57 ethnic controls. Both patients showed delayed psychomotor
development in infancy with poor speech acquisition. Each also had
symptoms of a myopathy, with easy fatigability and predominantly
proximal muscle weakness and atrophy. Brain MRS showed decreased
creatine, and urine guanidinoacetate levels were low. Treatment with
oral creatine resulted in clinical improvement and increased cerebral
creatine levels.

.0003
CEREBRAL CREATINE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME 3
GATM, ARG169TER

In 2 Jordanian sibs, born of consanguineous parents, with CCDS3
(612718), Verma (2010) identified a homozygous arg169-to-ter (R169X)
substitution in the GATM gene. Both patients showed delayed development
in early childhood and began to show progressive proximal muscle
weakness with features of a myopathy in their late teens. Laboratory
studies showed undetectable GAA levels. Treatment with oral creatine
supplementation resulted in dramatic improvement of muscle strength, but
speech and cognitive impairment were unchanged.

Comeaux et al. (2013) reported 2 sibs with CCDSD3 who were homozygous
for a c.505C-T transition in exon 4 of the GATM gene, resulting in an
R169X substitution.

.0004
CEREBRAL CREATINE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME 3
GATM, IVS3DS, G-T, +1

In a Chinese girl with CCDS3 (612718), Ndika et al. (2012) identified a
homozygous G-to-T transversion in intron 3 of the GATM gene
(c.484+1G-T), resulting in a splice site and a truncated protein lacking
exon 3 (Ala97ValfsTer11). The mutant transcript was subject to
nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Each unaffected parent was heterozygous
for the mutation. GATM activity was not detectable in patient cells. The
patient showed significant developmental progress after early and
intense treatment with creatine supplementation.

.0005
CEREBRAL CREATINE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME 3
GATM, TYR203SER

In 2 sisters, born of consanguineous parents, with CCDS3 (612718),
Nouioua et al. (2013) identified a homozygous c.608A-C transversion in
exon 4 of the GATM gene, resulting in a tyr203-to-ser (Y203S)
substitution at a highly conserved residue. Each unaffected parent was
heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found in 210 control
alleles.

607825	TITLE *607825 HOOK, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 3; HOOK3
;;HK3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Hook proteins are cytosolic coiled-coil proteins that contain conserved
N-terminal domains, which attach to microtubules, and more divergent
C-terminal domains, which mediate binding to organelles. The Drosophila
Hook protein is a component of the endocytic compartment (summary by
Walenta et al., 2001).

CLONING

Using homology with HOOK1 (607820) and HOOK2 (607824), Walenta et al.
(2001) identified an EST containing HOOK3, and they obtained the
full-length cDNA by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE of a placenta cDNA library.
The deduced 718-amino acid protein has an acidic N-terminal globular
domain, an extended central coiled-coil motif, and a basic C-terminal
globular domain. HOOK3 shares significant identity with HOOK1, HOOK2,
and the Drosophila Hook protein, with highest conservation in the
N-terminal domain. Western blot analysis detected HOOK3 in all mouse
tissues and human and monkey cell lines examined. Endogenous HOOK3
detected in HEK293 cells had an apparent molecular mass of about 83 kD.
Immunolocalization of endogenous HOOK3 in Hep2 cells revealed a
perinuclear distribution and colocalization with Golgi marker proteins.
Immunogold labeling revealed a polarized distribution of HOOK3 in the
Golgi complex, consistent with labeling of the cis face of the Golgi.

GENE FUNCTION

By Western blot analysis of HEK293 immunoprecipitates, Walenta et al.
(2001) determined that HOOK3 exists in a protein complex that is
distinct from complexes containing HOOK1 and HOOK2. By microtubule
spin-down assay, they determined that full-length HOOK3 and a C-terminal
truncation mutant bound to microtubules. An N-terminal domain of 164
amino acids was sufficient to bind directly to microtubules.
Overexpression of full-length HOOK3 in monkey kidney cells caused a
scattered Golgi morphology and disrupted the microtubule network. During
mitosis, HOOK3 localized to the microtubule asters in prophase. When the
mitotic spindle was evident in metaphase, HOOK3 showed a more diffuse
cytoplasmic distribution.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Creatine kinases (CKs; EC 2.7.3.2) catalyze the reversible transfer of
high energy phosphate from ATP to creatine, generating ADP and
phosphocreatine. CK isoenzymes are crucial to energy metabolism,
particularly in tissues with high energy requirements. Nuclear genes
encode 4 CK subunits: cytoplasmic muscle (CKM; 123310), cytoplasmic
brain (CKB; 123280), ubiquitous mitochondrial (CKMT1B), and sarcomeric
mitochondrial (CKMTS; 123295) (Klein et al., 1991). A nearly identical
copy of CKMT1B, designated CKMT1A (613415), is telomeric to CKMT1B on
chromosome 15 (Zhang et al., 2007).

CLONING

Haas et al. (1989) cloned CKMT1B, which they called placental MTCK, from
a human placenta cDNA library. The deduced 416-amino acid protein
contains a 38-amino acid N-terminal mitochondrial targeting and import
signal and an active site, cys278. In vitro-translated placental MTCK
was translocated into rat liver mitochondria and proteolytically
processed into smaller intermediate and mature forms. Northern blot
analysis using a placental MTCK-specific probe detected expression in
small intestine and placenta, but not in skeletal muscle, ventricle, and
liver.

GENE FUNCTION

Bark (1980) observed appearance of mitochondrial creatine kinase in the
serum of patients with profound shock, which in most of the patients was
fatal.

Human NDPKD (NME4; 601818) and MTCK are basic peripheral membrane
proteins with symmetrical homooligomeric structures. Using lipid
dilution assays, Epand et al. (2007) showed that NDPKD and ubiquitous
MTCK facilitated lipid transfer from one bilayer to another. Lipid
transfer occurred between liposomes mimicking the lipid composition of
mitochondrial contact sites, containing 30 mol % cardiolipin, but
transfer did not occur when cardiolipin was replaced by
phosphatidylglycerol. Ubiquitous MTCK, but not NDPKD, showed some
specificity in lipids transferred, and it was not active with
phosphatidylcholine alone. Ubiquitous MTCK underwent reversible
oligomerization between dimeric and octameric forms, but only the
octamer bridged membranes and promoted lipid transfer. Lipid transfer
did not involve vesicle fusion or loss of internal contents of the
liposomes.

Using Western blot analysis and confocal immunohistochemistry,
Schlattner et al. (2002) investigated the localization of creatine
kinases in mouse and human skin under healthy and pathologic conditions.
In mouse skin, they found high amounts of Ckb coexpressed with lower
amounts of Ckmt1b, both mainly localized in suprabasal layers of the
dermis, different cell types of hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and
the subcutaneous panniculus carnosus muscle. Except for sebaceous
glands, these cells also expressed creatine transporter (CRT, or SLC6A8;
300036). Ckm and Ckmts were restricted to panniculus carnosus. Western
blot analysis showed that Ckb and Crt were upregulated about 3-fold
immediately after wounding of mouse skin, whereas the amount of Ckmt1b
increased 10 to 15 days after wounding. Healthy and psoriatic human skin
showed a similar coexpression pattern of CKB, CKMT1B, and CRT, with CRT
upregulated in psoriasis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Haas et al. (1989) determined that the CKMT1B gene contains 9 exons and
spans 5.5 kb. The 5-prime flanking region lacks CAAT and TATA motifs,
but it has a high GC content and 2 putative SP1 (189906)-binding sites.

MAPPING

By means of a clone from the human CKMT1B gene in Southern analysis of
somatic cell hybrid DNA, Stallings et al. (1988) assigned the CKMT1B
gene to chromosome 15. Steeghs et al. (1994) mapped the CKMT1B gene to
human chromosome 15q15 and to mouse chromosome 2 bands F1-F3 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

Zhang et al. (2007) stated that a nearly identical copy of CKMT1B,
designated CKMT1A, is telomeric to the CKMT1B gene on chromosome 15q15.

;;PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE, MAGNESIUM-DEPENDENT, 1, ALPHA ISOFORM;;
PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 2C, ALPHA ISOFORM; PP2CA;;
PP2C-ALPHA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PPM1A is a serine/threonine protein phosphatase that is essential for
regulating cellular stress responses in eukaryotes. For further
background information on serine/threonine protein phosphatases, see
605119.

CLONING

By screening a human teratocarcinoma cDNA library with rat Pp2c-alpha as
the probe, Mann et al. (1992) cloned the human counterpart, PPM1A, which
they called PP2C-alpha. The PPM1A cDNA encodes a predicted 382-amino
acid peptide that shares 99.7% amino acid identity with rabbit
Pp2c-alpha.

In a genetic screen to identify protein phosphatases that negatively
regulate the p38 (600289) and JNK (see 601158) stress-activated MAPK
cascades, Takekawa et al. (1998) obtained a PP2C-alpha cDNA, which they
initially called MC4, that encodes a 324-amino acid peptide. The authors
hypothesized that MC4 is an alternative splicing product of PP2C-alpha.
The 2 proteins, which they termed PP2C-alpha-1 (382 amino acids) and
PP2C-alpha-2 (324 amino acids), differ at the C terminus. Northern blot
analysis detected 2.8- and 4.4-kb transcripts, which correspond to
PP2C-alpha-1 and PP2C-alpha-2, respectively. Both transcripts were
expressed at high levels in heart, placenta, skeletal muscle, and
pancreas, and the 4.4-kb transcript (PP2C-alpha-2) was detected in
brain.

GENE FUNCTION

Using immunohistochemical analysis, Das et al. (1996) detected PPM1A in
both the cytoplasm and nucleus of mammalian cells, consistent with a
role in dephosphorylating components of stress-activated pathways.

By expressing PPM1A in mammalian cells, Takekawa et al. (1998)
demonstrated that PPM1A inhibits the activation of the stress-responsive
p38 and JNK MAPK cascades. Their in vivo and in vitro observations
indicated that PPM1A dephosphorylates and inactivates MAPKKs (MKK6
(601254) and SEK1 (601335)) and a MAPK (p38) in the stress-responsive
MAPK cascades. Using coimmunoprecipitation assays, the authors
demonstrated that PPM1A directly interacts with p38.

A key step in TGF-beta (TGFB1; 190180) signaling is ligand-induced
phosphorylation of receptor-activated SMADs (see SMAD2; 601366). Using a
functional genomic approach, Lin et al. (2006) identified human PPM1A as
a SMAD phosphatase. PPM1A dephosphorylated and promoted nuclear export
of TGF-beta-activated SMAD2 and SMAD3 (603109) in human cells. Ectopic
expression of PPM1A abolished TGF-beta-induced antiproliferative and
transcriptional responses, whereas depletion of PPM1A enhanced TGF-beta
signaling in human and other mammalian cells. In zebrafish,
Smad-antagonizing activity of Ppm1a was observed during Nodal
(601265)-dependent early embryogenesis. Lin et al. (2006) concluded that
PPM1A plays a critical role in TGF-beta signaling through
dephosphorylation of SMAD2 and SMAD3.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Das et al. (1996) determined the crystal structure of PPM1A, which they
called PP2C. The structure revealed a novel protein fold with a
catalytic domain composed of a central beta sandwich that binds 2
manganese ions, which is surrounded by alpha helices. The authors stated
that the protein architecture and deduced catalytic mechanism are
similar to the PP1, PP2A, and PP2B family of protein ser/thr
phosphatases.

and eukaryotes. The 20S proteasome is composed of 7 alpha and 7 beta
subunits that dimerize to form an alpha(7)beta(7)beta(7)alpha(7)
structure. Subunits are designated alpha or beta depending on their
homology to the Thermoplasma acidophilus proteasome in which the beta
subunits are catalytically active. The 20S core complex associates with
regulatory proteins that function as proteasome activators in vivo. One
pathway of activation uses a 19S complex that is involved in the
ubiquitin (191339) pathway of protein breakdown. The PA28 complex is an
alternative proteasome activator that does not employ the use of
ubiquitin. The complex is composed of 2 homologous subunits called alpha
and beta, which form a hexameric ring. PA28 appears to be involved in
the presentation of endogenous antigens by MHC class I molecules. The
PA28 complex is expressed constitutively in antigen-presenting cells,
and its expression is upregulated by interferon gamma (147570). Many of
the genes involved in class I antigen presentation are encoded within
the MHC, including the 2 proteasome subunits PSMB9 (177045), also known
as LMP2, and PSMB8 (177046), also known as LMP7. McCusker et al. (1997)
completed the mapping of the human proteasome beta-type genes: by
fluorescence in situ hybridization they mapped the PSMB2 gene to 1p34.2,
the PSMB3 gene (602176) to 2q35, and the PSMB4 gene (602177) to 1q21.
They also showed that the genes encoding the alpha (600654) and beta
(602161) subunits of the PA28 complex are closely linked on 14q11.2,
within 1 Mb of the beta proteasome locus PSMB5 (600306). Thus, with the
exception of the genes encoding the PSMB9 and PSMB8 subunits, the beta
genes are not closely linked in the human genome. PSMB2 and PSMB4 map to
regions of chromosome 1 that are proposed to be paralogous to regions of
the human genome where other beta proteasome genes map: chromosome 6,
containing the major histocompatibility complex, and chromosome 9.

;;ALDO-KETO REDUCTASE 7; AKR7;;
AFLATOXIN B1-ALDEHYDE REDUCTASE; AFAR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Aldo-keto reductases, such as AKR7A2, are involved in the detoxification
of aldehydes and ketones.

CLONING

Ireland et al. (1998) used a rat aflatoxin B1-aldehyde reductase (AFAR)
cDNA and a human EST sequence to isolate human AFAR cDNAs from
cerebellum and liver libraries. The full-length cDNA encodes a 330-amino
acid polypeptide with 78% identity to rat AFAR, 22% identity to a
Shaker-related voltage-gated potassium channel, and 16% identity to
aldose reductase (103880). Northern blot analysis revealed that AFAR is
expressed in a wide range of human tissues.

By EST database analysis, Kelly et al. (2002) identified an AKR7A2
splice variant that encodes a deduced 359-amino acid protein with an
N-terminal extension.

GENE FUNCTION

Ireland et al. (1998) showed that expressed AFAR can metabolize
aflatoxin, but its specificity for some substrates differs from that of
rat AFAR. They showed that AFAR is the principal human liver reductase
for 2-carboxybenzaldehyde.

GENE STRUCTURE

Praml et al. (2003) determined that the AKR7A2 gene contains 7 exons and
spans 7.8 kb.

MAPPING

By FISH and genomic sequence analysis, Praml et al. (2003) mapped the
AKR7A2 gene to chromosome 1p36.1-p35, where it lies in a gene cluster
with the AKR7A3 (608477) and AKR7A4 (608478) genes. The genes are
oriented in a head-to-tail tandem arrangement,
distal-5-prime-AKR7A2-AKR7A3-AKR7A4-3-prime-proximal. AKR7A pseudogenes
are located on chromosomes Xq25 and 1p12. Praml et al. (2003) mapped the
mouse Akr7a2 gene to chromosome 5, where it is proximal to the Pla2g2a
gene (172411).

611782	TITLE *611782 DOWN SYNDROME CELL ADHESION MOLECULE-LIKE 1; DSCAML1
;;DSCAM-LIKE 1;;
KIAA1132
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Hirosawa et al. (1999) obtained a partial cDNA encoding
DSCAML1, which they designated KIAA1132. RT-PCR ELISA detected moderate
expression in adult and fetal brain and in all specific adult brain
regions examined. Low expression was detected in kidney and ovary, and
little to no expression was detected in all other tissues examined.

Agarwala et al. (2001) cloned full-length DSCAML1 by screening a fetal
brain cDNA library with the partial KIAA1132 cDNA. The deduced
2,053-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 224 kD. It
has a 1,573-amino acid extracellular domain, a 21-amino acid
transmembrane domain, and a 441-amino acid cytoplasmic domain. The
extracellular domain contains 10 Ig C2-type domains, 6 fibronectin (see
135600) type III domains, 15 N-glycosylation sites, an RGD-type cell
attachment sequence, and a carboxypeptidase (see CPA1; 114850)
zinc-binding region-2. The cytoplasmic domain contains 7 putative
phosphorylation sites and 6 N-myristoylation sites. The domain
structures of DSCAML1 and DSCAM (602523) are identical, and they share
64% and 45% amino acid identity in their extracellular and cytoplasmic
domains, respectively. Northern blot analysis detected a 7.6-kb
transcript in fetal and adult brain and in all adult brain sections
examined, except amygdala. A weak signal was detected in adult kidney.
Northern blot analysis of whole mouse embryos detected expression at 17
days postcoitum and in all postnatal stages tested. In adult mouse,
expression was detected only in brain. In situ hybridization revealed
Dscaml1 in the Purkinje cell layer of mouse cerebellum, in granule cells
of the dentate gyrus and in pyramidal cells of the CA1 and CA3 regions
of the hippocampus, and in olfactory bulb, with moderate expression in
cerebral cortex and thalamus. Immunohistochemical analysis of
transfected mouse fibroblasts and rat PC12 pheochromocytoma cells showed
expression on the cell surface. In differentiated transfected PC12
cells, human DSCAML1 associated with axons, but not with dendrites.
Southern blot analysis suggested that DSCAML1 is highly conserved in
vertebrates.

By RT-PCR of adult human brain, Barlow et al. (2002) identified DSCAML1
splice variants lacking either exon 3 or 4, resulting in removal of
either the N- or C- terminal half of the Ig2 domain, respectively.
Barlow et al. (2002) noted that their full-length DSCAML1 cDNA has an
in-frame ATG 180 bp upstream of the translational start site reported by
Agarwala et al. (2001), resulting in a 60-amino acid N-terminal
extension to the protein. Northern blot analysis detected several
DSCAML1 splice variants in all human adult tissues examined. The 7.5-kb
transcript was expressed predominantly in brain, but was also present in
kidney, skeletal muscle, pancreas, and lung, along with smaller
variants. Expression was detected in all adult brain regions examined,
including amygdala. Mouse tissues showed an expression pattern
significantly different than that in human.

GENE FUNCTION

Agarwala et al. (2001) found that mouse cells expressing human DSCAML1
adhered to each other in large aggregates. Aggregation was mediated by
homophilic interactions between DSCAML1 molecules expressed on the cell
surface and did not require calcium.

Yamagata and Sanes (2008) demonstrated that 4 closely related
immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) adhesion molecules--Dscam (602523),
DscamL, Sidekick-1 (SDK1; 607216), and SDK2 (607217)--are expressed in
chick by nonoverlapping subsets of interneurons and retinal ganglion
cells that form synapses in distinct inner plexiform layer (IPL)
sublaminae. Moreover, each protein is concentrated within the
appropriate sublaminae and each mediates homophilic adhesion. Loss- and
gain-of-function studies in vivo indicated that these IgSF members
participate in determining the inner plexiform layer sublaminae in which
synaptic partners arborize and connect. Thus, vertebrate Dscams, like
Drosophila Dscams, play roles in neural connectivity. Yamagata and Sanes
(2008) concluded that, taken together, their results on Dscams and
Sidekicks suggested the existence of an IgSF code for laminar
specificity in retina and, by implication, in other parts of the central
nervous system.

GENE STRUCTURE

Agarwala et al. (2001) determined that the DSCAML1 gene contains at
least 32 exons. Barlow et al. (2002) identified 33 exons in DSCAML1.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Hirosawa et al. (1999) mapped the DSCAML1
gene to chromosome 11. Using FISH, Agarwala et al. (2001) mapped the
human DSCAML1 gene to chromosome 11q23 and the mouse Dscaml1 gene to
chromosome 9B.

;;PRP3;;
HPRP3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The removal of introns from nuclear pre-mRNAs occurs on complexes called
spliceosomes, which are made up of 4 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein
(snRNP) particles and an undefined number of transiently associated
splicing factors. PRPF3 is 1 of several proteins that associate with U4
and U6 snRNPs.

CLONING

Using peptide sequences of PRP3 purified from HeLa cell nuclear
extracts, Lauber et al. (1997) and Horowitz et al. (1997) identified
ESTs containing PRP3 and sequenced full-length cDNAs. The deduced
683-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of about 77.5 kD.
PRP3 shares significant homology with yeast and nematode Prp3, with the
similarity limited to their C-terminal halves. Lauber et al. (1997)
determined that PRP3 contains an N-terminal nuclear localization signal
and serine-rich region, followed by a proline-rich region and a
C-terminal nuclear localization signal. Overall, PRP3 has a large
percentage of basic residues (18% arginine and lysine). PRP3 also
contains 3 sequences that are homologous to one another and that share a
central ELK motif. It also has a region with some similarity to a
double-stranded RNA-binding motif. In vitro translation resulted in a
protein that comigrated with the native protein at an apparent molecular
mass of about 90 kD.

Using yeast Prp3 to interrogate a sequence database, followed by PCR and
cDNA library screening, Wang et al. (1997) cloned HPRP3. The deduced
protein contains 682 amino acids and has a calculated molecular mass of
about 77 kD. Western blot analysis of HeLa cell nuclear extracts
detected PRP3 protein at an apparent molecular mass of about 90 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Lauber et al. (1997) and Wang et al. (1997) confirmed the presence of
HPRP3 in U4/U6-U5 tri-snRNPs and showed that HPRP3 associated more
tightly with U4/U6 snRNP. Wang et al. (1997) determined that recombinant
HPRP3, produced in E. coli, interacted directly with HPRP4 (607795) from
HeLa cell nuclear extracts.

Gonzalez-Santos et al. (2002) determined that the central region of
HPRP3, but not the N or C termini, is required for HPRP4 binding. They
hypothesized that HPRP3 may recruit HPRP4 for the U4/U6 snRNP assembly.

MAPPING

By FISH, Heng et al. (1998) mapped the PRPF3 gene to chromosome 1q21.2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Mutations in human splicing factors PRPF31 (606419) and PRPF8 (607300)
may cause retinitis pigmentosas (RP) in some families. Since the human
HPRP3 gene, ortholog of the yeast pre-mRNA splicing factor PRP3,
localizes within the RP18 disease interval, Chakarova et al. (2002)
screened HPRP3 as a candidate in 3 chromosome 1q-linked RP families. Two
different missense mutations in 2 English families, a Danish family, and
in 3 RP individuals were identified. Both mutations are clustered within
a 2-codon stretch in the eleventh exon of the HPRP3 gene. One of the
mutations, thr494 to met (T494M; 607301.0001), was seen repeatedly in
apparently unlinked families, raising the possibility of a mutation
hotspot. Haplotype analysis using SNPs spanning the HPRP3 gene region
supported multiple origins of the mutation. The altered amino acids,
which were highly conserved in all known HPRP3 orthologs, suggested a
major function of that domain in the splicing process. Although HPRP3
appears to be ubiquitously expressed, the authors speculated that a
retina-specific splicing element may interact with HPRP3 and generate
the rod photoreceptor-specific phenotype.

By quantitating RNA content in Northern blots, Tanackovic et al. (2011)
determined that normal human retina expressed about 7 times more major
snRNAs than other tissues tested. Retina also expressed about twice as
many minor snRNAs than other tissues, except for testis, which had
comparable minor snRNA content. Retina also showed higher content of
processed pre-mRNAs. Compared with normal human lymphocytes, patient
lymphocyte cell lines with mutations in the PRPF31, PRPF3, and PRPF8
genes showed mutation- and gene-specific changes in the stoichiometry of
snRNAs and altered composition of the precatalytic U4/U6.U5 complex.
Mutations in the PRPF genes caused delayed spliceosome assembly, with
transcript-specific splicing defects and altered patterns of alternative
splicing. Tanackovic et al. (2011) concluded that retinitis pigmentosa
is a systemic splicing disease, but that retina is more sensitive to the
defect due to elevated splicing activity in retina compared with other
tissues.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 18
PRPF3, THR494MET

In 2 English families and a Danish family with retinitis pigmentosa-18
(601414), Chakarova et al. (2002) found a 1482C-T transition in exon 11
of the PRPF3 gene, resulting in a thr494-to-met (T494M) substitution at
a highly conserved residue. Three of 150 simplex RP patients screened
were also heterozygous for the mutation.

Gonzalez-Santos et al. (2008) showed that the T494M substitution
significantly reduced the phosphorylation of PRPF3 by casein kinase II
(see 115440) in vitro and in cultured cells. Consequently, the PRPF3
C-terminal region was defective in its association with itself, PRPF4
(607795), and U4/U6 snRNA. Gonzalez-Santos et al. (2008) concluded that
phosphorylation of PRPF3 on T494 is a key step in initiating
interactions within U4/U6 snRNP complex, and that aberrant interactions
between T494M and the U4/U6 snRNP complex cause the RP18 phenotype.

.0002
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 18
PRPF3, PRO493SER

In an isolated case of retinitis pigmentosa-18 (601414), Chakarova et
al. (2002) found a 1478C-T transition in exon 11 of the PRPF3 gene,
resulting in a pro493-to-ser (P493S) substitution at a highly conserved
residue.

In affected members of a Spanish family with retinitis pigmentosa-18
(601414), Gamundi et al. (2008) identified a heterozygous 1466C-A
transversion in exon 11 of the PRPF3 gene, resulting in an ala489-to-asp
(A489D) substitution.

600129	TITLE *600129 PHOSPHODIESTERASE 4D, cAMP-SPECIFIC; PDE4D
;;DUNCE-LIKE PHOSPHODIESTERASE E3, FORMERLY; DPDE3, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cyclic nucleotides are important second messengers that regulate and
mediate a number of cellular responses to extracellular signals, such as
hormones, light, and neurotransmitters. Cyclic nucleotide
phosphodiesterases (PDEs) regulate the cellular concentrations of cyclic
nucleotides and thereby play a role in signal transduction. PDE4D is a
class IV cAMP-specific PDE. The PDE4D gene is complex, with at least 9
different variants encoding functional proteins (summary by Milatovich
et al. (1994) and Dominiczak and McBride (2003)).

CLONING

Using degenerate primers based on Drosophila Dnc and rat Dpd to amplify
human Dpd orthologs, followed by low-stringency hybridization of a brain
cDNA library, Bolger et al. (1993) cloned DPDE3, which they called
PDE43, and a partial splice variant, PDE39, that differs in its 5-prime
sequence. The deduced DPDE3 protein contains 657 amino acids and has 2
N-terminal domains that share a high degree of conservation with other
DPDE proteins, and a C-terminal catalytic domain. RNase protection
assays detected DPDE3 transcripts in 5 of 7 cell lines examined.

Using primers designed from rat Pde4d, Nemoz et al. (1996) cloned 2
alternatively spliced variants of PDE4D, which they designated PDE4D2
and PDE4D3, from peripheral blood mononuclear cell mRNA. These variants
differed from PDE4D1 primarily in the N-terminal region. In addition,
they found that variants PDE4D1 and PDE4D2, but not PDE4D3, lack an
upstream conserved region I (UCRI) found in the Drosophila 'dunce' PDE
sequence. Western blot analysis of endogenous PDE4D variants in
mononuclear cells and of PDE4D2 and PDE4D3 expressed by transfected
embryonic kidney cells revealed that PDE4D1, PDE4D2, and PDE4D3 have
apparent molecular masses of 72 kD, 67 kD, and 93 kD, respectively.

Bolger et al. (1997) cloned alternative splice variants PDE4D4 and
PDE4D5, which encode deduced proteins of 810 and 746 amino acids,
respectively. These differ from PDE4D1, PDE4D2, and PDE4D3 in the
N-terminal sequence. Transfection of PDE4D4 and PDE4D5 into COS-7 cells
resulted in the expression of proteins with apparent molecular masses of
119 kD and 105 kD, respectively.

Miro et al. (2000) identified 3 splice variants that were inactive due
to truncation of the C-terminal catalytic domains.

Using common sequences of rat and human PDE4D as probe, Wang et al.
(2003) identified PDE4D6 and PDE4D7 in a hippocampal cDNA library. Using
primers specific to each isoform, they cloned full-length PCE4D6 and
PDE4D7 by PCR of hippocampal cDNA. By searching an EST database for
5-prime alternatively spliced variants, followed by 5-prime RACE and
screening a skeletal muscle cDNA library, they cloned PDE4D8. The
protein structures of these variants conform to that of other PDE4D
isoforms, with a variable N-terminus containing UCR1 and UCR2, followed
by a C-terminal catalytic core. Sites for secondary modification include
several phosphorylation sites, a putative myristoylation site within
UCR2, and sites for N-linked glycosylation. PDE4D6 encodes a deduced
518-amino acid protein which lacks the N-terminal UCR1 and half of UCR2
and has a calculated molecular mass of about 59 kD; PDE4D7 encodes a
deduced 748-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of about
84.7 kD; and PDE4D8 encodes a deduced 687-amino acid protein. PDE4D7 and
PDE4D8 contain both UCR1 and UCR2, which places them in the class of
long PDE4D isoforms. Semiquantitative PCR detected PDE4D6 expressed only
in brain. PDE4D7 was expressed in several tissues, with stronger
expression in lung and kidney, and PDE4D8 was expressed at high levels
in heart and skeletal muscle, and more weakly in lung.

GENE FUNCTION

Bolger et al. (1993) confirmed that PDE43 showed cAMP PDE activity,
which was inhibited by several cyclin nucleotide PDE inhibitors.

Nemoz et al. (1996) demonstrated phosphodiesterase activity in embryonic
kidney cells following transfection of PDE4D2 and PDE4D3.

Bolger et al. (1997) found that COS cell-expressed and native PDE4D1 and
PDE4D2 were localized only in the cytosol, whereas PDE4D3, PDE4D4, and
PDE4D5 were expressed in both cytosolic and particulate fractions.
Rolipram, a specific PDE4 inhibitor, inhibited all PDE4D isoforms
tested, and showed a significantly lower IC50 for the cytosolic forms of
PDE4D than for the particulate forms. Bolger et al. (1997) concluded
that the N-terminal regions of the various isoforms determine both the
subcellular localization and the sensitivity to inhibitors.

Miro et al. (2000) demonstrated that TNFA (191160) upregulated the basal
expression of PDE4D in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(HUVEC). Examination of the variants responsive to TNFA revealed that
PDE4D4, which was not detected in untreated cells, accumulated beginning
4 hours after treatment and increased at 24 hours. The expression of
PDE4D5, transiently induced after 4 hours, was inhibited and became
undetectable after 24 hours. The expression of PDE4D1, PDE4D2, and
PDE4D3 levels were unchanged.

Using a promoter/reporter assay, LeJeune et al. (2002) determined that
the promoter region for variant PDE4D5, which contains 2 putative cAMP
response elements (CREs), was activated in response to increased
cellular cAMP. Site-directed mutational analysis revealed that the CRE
at position -210 was the principal component underlying the cAMP
responsiveness. The authors further determined that cAMP induced PDE4D5
expression in primary cultured human airway smooth muscle cells, leading
to upregulated phosphodiesterase activity.

Wang et al. (2003) characterized PDE4D6 and PDE4D7 expressed in insect
cells, and showed that both enzymes have a high affinity for cAMP, and
both are inhibited by rolipram. The activity of PDE4D7, but not PDE4D6,
was elevated in response to protein kinase A (see 176911), presumably
through phosphorylation of a PKA site in UCR1.

Dodge-Kafka et al. (2005) identified a cAMP-responsive signaling complex
maintained by the muscle-specific A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP6;
604691) that includes PKA (188830), PDE4D3, and EPAC1 (606057). These
intermolecular interactions facilitate the dissemination of distinct
cAMP signals through each effector protein. Anchored PKA stimulates
PDE4D3 to reduce local cAMP concentrations, whereas an AKAP6-associated
ERK5 (602521) kinase module suppresses PDE4D3. PDE4D3 also functions as
an adaptor protein that recruits EPAC1, an exchange factor for the small
GTPase RAP1 (179520), to enable cAMP-dependent attenuation of ERK5.
Pharmacologic and molecular manipulations of the AKAP6 complex show that
anchored ERK5 can induce cardiomyoctye hypertrophy. Thus, Dodge-Kafka et
al. (2005) concluded that 2 coupled cAMP-dependent feedback loops are
coordinated within the context of the AKAP6 complex, suggesting that
local control of cAMP signaling by AKAP proteins is more intricate than
previously appreciated.

McLachlan et al. (2007) found that all 9 PDE4D isoforms were expressed
in healthy adult human hippocampus and in hippocampus from a patient
with advanced Alzheimer disease (AD; 104300). However, the patient with
AD had very low levels of isoforms D3 (25% of controls) and D5 through
D9 (0.7 to 7.5%), whereas levels of the short isoform D1 were doubled
(262%). Levels of D2 and D4 were essentially unchanged compared to
normal.

Using quantitative RT-PCR, Peter et al. (2007) showed that stimulation
of CD4-positive T cells increased the expression of PDE4A (600126),
PDE4B (600127), and PDE4D in a specific and time-dependent manner.
Treatment with small interfering RNA revealed that the different PDE4
subtypes had nonredundant but complementary effects on T-cell cytokine
production, with PDE4D having a small but more significant effect than
the other PDE4 subtypes on proliferation and IL2 (147680), IL5 (147850),
and IFNG (147570) production.

GENE STRUCTURE

LeJeune et al. (2002) identified 17 exons of the PDE4D gene spanning
just under 1 Mb. They identified 4 putative intronic promoters upstream
from the start codons for each of the first 5 isoforms identified.
PDE4D1 and PDE4D2 share the same putative promoter which, in the rat
sequence, lacks a TATA box, but contains a cAMP-responsive region, a
number of GC-rich regions, and binding sites for SP1 (189906), AP1 (see
165160), and AP2 (107580). The promoter for the PDE4D5 variant contains
2 putative CREs and a number of CCAAT enhancer-binding protein-binding
sites (see CEBPA, 116897).

Wang et al. (2003) determined that the putative promoter regions of
PDE4D6, PDE4D7, and PDE4D8 contain multiple CREs within 2 kb upstream of
the starting methionine.

Gretarsdottir et al. (2003) determined that the PDE4D gene contains at
least 22 exons and spans about 1.5 Mb.

MAPPING

Milatovich et al. (1994) assigned the PDE4D gene to human chromosome 5
by Southern analysis of somatic cell hybrid lines and regionalized the
assignment to 5q12 by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The
homologous locus was assigned to mouse chromosome 13 by Southern
analysis of recombinant inbred (RI) mouse strains.

Szpirer et al. (1995) mapped the PDE4D gene to human chromosome 5 and to
rat chromosome 2 using somatic cell hybrids segregating either human or
rat chromosomes, respectively.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Susceptibility to Ischemic Stroke

Gretarsdottir et al. (2002) mapped susceptibility to stroke to
chromosome 5q12; see STRK1 (606799). Gretarsdottir et al. (2003)
reported fine mapping of the locus and testing it for association with
stroke. They found the strongest association in the PDE4D gene,
especially for carotid and cardiogenic stroke, the forms of stroke
related to atherosclerosis (ischemic stroke). They observed a
substantial dysregulation of multiple PDE4D isoforms in affected
individuals. Notably, they found that haplotypes could be classified
into 3 distinct groups: wildtype, at-risk, and protective. The at-risk
haplotype had significantly lower expression of the PDE4D7 and PDE4D9
isoforms. They proposed that PDE4D is involved in the pathogenesis of
stroke, possibly through atherosclerosis, which is the primary
pathologic process underlying ischemic stroke.

Rosand et al. (2006) noted that 9 studies had been published as
follow-up to the report of Gretarsdottir et al. (2002): 5 had claimed
replication of the findings and 4 had not. A total of 11 SNPs in the
PDE4D gene had been investigated among different phenotypic groups of
stroke patients, such as small-vessel, large-vessel, cardioembolic, and
all ischemic. Using haplotype data to examine the correlation between
these various SNPs, Rosand et al. (2006) found that none of the SNPs was
significantly correlated to the at-risk haplotype identified by
Gretarsdottir et al. (2002). The authors concluded that the original
PDE4D association with stroke should be viewed with caution.

- Acrodysostosis 2

In 4 unrelated patients with acrodysostosis-2 (ACRDYS2; 614613), Michot
et al. (2012) identified 4 different de novo heterozygous missense
mutations in the PDE4D gene (600129.0001-600129.0004). The first 2
mutations were identified by exome sequencing and confirmed by Sanger
sequencing. Although all 4 missense mutations were predicted to be
pathogenic by PolyPhen and were absent from 200 controls, functional
studies were not performed. The patients ranged in age from 3 to 7
years. All had advanced bone age, facial dysostosis with nasal
hypoplasia and depressed nasal bridge, severe brachydactyly with short
metacarpals, metatarsals, and phalanges, and cone-shaped epiphyses. All
also had intellectual disability with speech and psychomotor
retardation. One had intrauterine growth retardation, but none had short
stature. None had evidence of hormone resistance, except 1 who had
increased parathyroid hormone (PTH). Two patients developed intracranial
hypertension due to sinus thrombosis. Michot et al. (2012) concluded
that the mutations resulted in decreased phosphodiesterase activity, a
dysregulation in cAMP levels, and alterations in the cAMP signaling
pathway, resulting in the growth and intellectual deficits in these
patients.

Independently and simultaneously, Lee et al. (2012) identified de novo
heterozygous missense mutations in the PDE4D gene
(600129.0005-600129.0007) in 3 unrelated patients with ACRDYS2. The
mutations were predicted to be pathogenic and were absent from almost
6,000 exomes, but no functional studies were performed. However, because
PDE4D is a dimer, the missense alleles may cause the phenotype via a
dominant-negative effect on the protein. All 3 patients had small hands
and midface hypoplasia, 2 had mild short stature, and 2 had lumbar
stenosis. One had normal psychomotor development, 1 had significantly
impaired development, and the third had mild developmental disability.
One had congenital hypothyroidism, 1 had cryptorchidism, and 1 had no
endocrine abnormalities.

In 3 sibs with ACRDYS2, Lynch et al. (2013) identified a heterozygous
mutation in the PDE4D gene (A243V; 600129.0008). Their father, who also
carried the mutation, was found to have subtle clinical abnormalities
consistent with the disorder. Four additional unrelated patients with a
similar phenotype were each found to carry a de novo heterozygous
missense mutation in the PDE4D gene. The data confirmed that PDE4D is a
major locus for acrodysostosis, as different mutations were identified
in all 5 probands in the series.

ANIMAL MODEL

PDE4D is the mammalian homolog of 'dunce' in Drosophila. Flies deficient
in this PDE display impairments of the central nervous system and
reproductive functions (Dudai et al., 1976). Although only 1 dunce PDE
has been described in the fly, 4 orthologous genes are present in mice,
rats, and humans: PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4C (600128), and PDE4D. The encoded
proteins share considerable homology in their catalytic and regulatory
domains. To examine the role of a PDE in cAMP signaling in vivo, Jin et
al. (1999) inactivated the PDE4D gene in mice. This isozyme is involved
in feedback regulation of cAMP levels. Mice deficient in PDE4D exhibited
delayed growth as well as reduced viability and female fertility. The
decrease in fertility of the null female was caused by impaired
ovulation and diminished sensitivity of the granulosa cells to
gonadotropins. These pleiotropic phenotypes demonstrated that PDE4D
plays a critical role in cAMP signaling and that the activity of this
isoenzyme is required for the regulation of growth and fertility.

Muscarinic cholinergic signaling plays an essential role in the control
of normal airway functions and in the development of pulmonary disease
states, including asthma. Hansen et al. (2000) demonstrated that the
airways of mice deficient in the cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase PDE4D
were no longer responsive to cholinergic stimulation. Airway
hyperreactivity that followed exposure to antigen was also abolished in
PDE4D -/- mice, despite apparently normal lung inflammatory
infiltration. The loss of cholinergic responsiveness was specific to the
airway, not observed in the heart, and was associated with a loss of
signaling through muscarinic receptors with an inability to decrease
cAMP accumulation. These findings demonstrated that the PDE4D gene plays
an essential role in cAMP homeostasis and cholinergic stimulation of the
airway, and in the development of hyperreactivity. In view of the
therapeutic potentials of PDE4 inhibitors, the findings provided the
rationale for novel strategies that target a single PDE isoenzyme.

610328	TITLE *610328 RUN AND FYVE DOMAINS-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; RUFY2
;;KIAA1537
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned RUFY2, which they designated
KIAA1537. RT-PCR ELISA detected variable expression in all adult and
fetal tissues examined. Highest expression was in ovary, whole adult
brain, and testis, and lowest expression was in pancreas, spleen, fetal
liver, and fetal whole brain. RUFY2 was expressed in all specific adult
brain regions examined, with highest expression in amygdala.

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to RUFY1 (610327),
followed by screening prostate cancer and neuroblastoma cDNA libraries,
Yang et al. (2002) cloned RUFY2. The deduced 606-amino acid protein has
an N-terminal RUN domain, 2 central coiled-coil domains, and a
C-terminal FYVE domain containing 2 zinc-binding sites and an SH3 domain
recognition motif (PxxPxP). Northern blot analysis detected RUFY2
expression in brain, lung, and testis only.

GENE FUNCTION

By coimmunoprecipitation analysis, Yang et al. (2002) demonstrated that
RUFY2 directly interacted with ETK (EPHA3; 179611) following their
coexpression in a mouse myoblast cell line.

Majercak et al. (2006) showed that expression of RUFY2 reduced secretion
of beta-amyloid from human embryonic kidney cells stably expressing APP
(104760). The RUFY2 gene maps to a region of chromosome 10q that has
been linked to both late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD6; 605526) and
elevated plasma levels of pathogenic beta-amyloid.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the RUFY2
gene to chromosome 10 (TMAP WI-11265). By genomic sequence analysis,
Majercak et al. (2006) mapped the RUFY2 gene to chromosome 10q21.

182860	TITLE *182860 SPECTRIN, ALPHA, ERYTHROCYTIC 1; SPTA1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Spectrin, the predominant component of the membrane skeleton of the red
cell, is essential in determining the properties of the membrane
including its shape and deformability. It consists of 2 nonidentical
subunits, alpha (MW 240,000) and beta (MW 225,000; 182870) (Knowles et
al., 1984). Spectrin is present in the red cell membrane in a tetrameric
or oligomeric form through head-to-head self-association of heterodimers
that are linked by actin (see 102560) polymers and protein 4.1 (130500)
to form a 2-dimensional network. Ankyrin (612641) binds the skeleton to
the membrane lipid bilayer through its high-affinity association with
spectrin beta chains and the integral protein band 3 (109270) of the
lipid bilayer.

CLONING

Sahr et al. (1990) isolated overlapping cDNA clones for the entire
coding sequence of human erythroid alpha spectrin. The deduced
polypeptide contains 2,429 amino acids and, as noted by Speicher and
Marchesi (1984), is composed largely of homologous 106-amino acid repeat
units. The protein can be divided into 22 segments, 17 of which are
homologous. Only the very N-terminal 22 residues and the C-terminal 150
residues appear to be unrelated to the conserved repeat units.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kotula et al. (1991) noted that the SPTA gene spans 80 kb and includes
52 exons ranging in size from 18 to 684 bp. They mapped the exons and
the intron-exon junctions. The authors speculated that the absence of
correlation between exons and the 106-amino acid repeats characteristic
of the protein reflects the evolution of a spectrin-like gene from a
minigene early in the evolution of eukaryotes.

MAPPING

Birkenmeier et al. (1988) showed that the erythroid alpha-spectrin gene
is tightly linked to the spherocytosis locus on mouse chromosome 1,
suggesting that a defect in this gene is responsible for spherocytosis
in the mouse. Raeymaekers et al. (1988) found that alpha-spectrin is
linked to Duffy blood group (FY; 110700) on chromosome 1; the lod score
was 3.81 at theta = 0.0. By somatic cell hybrid studies, Huebner et al.
(1985) assigned the alpha-spectrin gene to chromosome 1 in both mouse
and man. By in situ hybridization, the human gene was localized to
1q22-q25. Since a non-Rh-linked form of elliptocytosis had been very
tentatively mapped (maximum lod score = 2.08) to this same region by
linkage to Duffy blood group (Keats, 1979; Rao et al., 1979), the defect
in that hematologic disorder may involve alpha spectrin. (As this turned
out to be the case, this is one of the first examples of positive
results from the 'candidate gene' approach to elucidating
etiopathogenesis.) In combination with in situ hybridization data, the
findings of Middleton-Price et al. (1988) suggested that SPTA may lie
within band 1q21. The gene was found to lie proximal to the breakpoint
at 1q23 in a balanced X;1 translocation. Another cell line showed 2
alpha-spectrin alleles, consistent with the location of alpha-spectrin
in the distal part of 1q21. Pakstis et al. (1989) presented linkage data
and analyzed the relationship between the SPTA1 locus and the anonymous
DNA fragment D1S75. Pairwise analyses estimated the maximum likelihood
of 12.8% recombination for the SPTA1/D1S75 interval with a peak lod
score of 5.04. In a linkage map of chromosome 1 prepared by Rouleau et
al. (1990), it was concluded that SPTA1 lies 17 cM proximal to Fy.

GENE FUNCTION

Kotula et al. (1991) noted that peptide mapping of spectrin partial
tryptic digests allowed division of the alpha- and beta-chains into 5
and 4 domains, respectively. The alpha-I and beta-I domains, which face
each other, participate in dimer self-association. Elliptocytosis can
result from changes in either the alpha-I or beta-I domain; changes in
either can result in weakened spectrin dimer self-association.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Knowles et al. (1984) identified polymorphisms in the alpha-II domain of
spectrin in Caucasian and black individuals. The polymorphisms did not
produce anemia and did not appear to alter the expression of an
underlying spherocytosis or elliptocytosis. In family studies, the alpha
II 46,000 MW variations were consistent with mendelian inheritance.

- Elliptocytosis 2

In blacks, variants of the spectrin alpha subunit have been found:
alpha-I/74, alpha-I/46, and alpha-I/65 (Lawler et al., 1984; Lecomte et
al., 1985; Lawler et al., 1985). Alloisio et al. (1986) found the
alpha-I/65 variant in non-black persons in North Africa where a protein
4.1 defect had been found most often.

Marchesi et al. (1987) reviewed varieties of abnormal spectrins
(182860.0001-182860.0004) that have been found in hereditary
elliptocytosis (130600). All show impaired self-association to form
oligomers.

Iarocci et al. (1988) described a 4-year-old Yoruba boy in Nigeria who
at birth had severe poikilocytosis, hemolytic anemia, and
hyperbilirubinemia requiring exchange transfusion and phototherapy. The
poikilocytic anemia was found to be due to compound heterozygosity for 2
alpha-spectrin mutations. The authors indicated that 7 structural
mutations of alpha spectrin (designated I/74, I/65, I/61, I/50a, I/50b,
and I/43,42) as well as truncated alpha spectrin have been identified in
patients with hereditary elliptocytosis or hereditary pyropoikilocytosis
by SDS-PAGE evaluation of red cell membrane proteins or by analysis of
tryptic peptides following limited digestion.

One class of elliptocytogenic change is spectrin alpha(I/74) which is
characterized by an increase in the alpha-I 74-kD fragment at the
expense of the parent alpha-I 80-kD fragment. Spectrin Culoz
(182860.0006) and spectrin Lyon (182860.0007) are examples of alpha I/74
mutations of the alpha-spectrin chain.

Sahr et al. (1989) used PCR to amplify the appropriate exons in DNA from
individuals with 3 variants of hereditary elliptocytosis. In 1,
abnormality resulted from a duplication of leucine codon 148 in exon 4;
TTG-CTG to TTG-TTG-CTG (182860.0003). In 2 other unrelated cases, 2
separate single base changes were observed in exon 6: CTG to CCG
(leucine-to-proline) encoding residue 254, and TCC to CCC
(serine-to-proline) encoding residue 255. Furthermore, in 2 unrelated
individuals, a single base change of CAG to CCG (glutamine-to-proline)
encoding residue 465 in exon 11 was observed.

- Pyropoikilocytosis

Lecomte et al. (1985) described abnormality of alpha spectrin in 2 black
families with elliptocytosis and pyropoikilocytosis (266140). Marchesi
et al. (1986) also demonstrated abnormality of alpha spectrin in 2
kindreds with hereditary elliptocytosis. The clinical expression ranged
from mild elliptocytosis without hemolysis to severe poikilocytic
hemolytic anemia clinically resembling hereditary pyropoikilocytosis.

Lawler et al. (1988) described a severe form of pyropoikilocytosis in a
6-year-old black girl who was a compound heterozygote for 2 distinct
alpha-spectrin mutations, a previously detected mutation in tryptic
fragment 74 and a new mutation in tryptic fragment 61.

Lecomte et al. (1990) found a new alpha-spectrin variant in a child with
severe neonatal hemolytic anemia (182860.0021). The abnormality was
thought to be homozygous in the propositus who showed poikilocytosis. No
abnormality was detected in the parents, who came from the West Indies
and were thought to be unrelated.

- Spherocytosis Type 3

Wichterle et al. (1996) described compound heterozygosity for 2 splicing
mutations (182860.0022; 182860.0023) in the SPTA1 gene that caused
hereditary spherocytosis (270970).

Gallagher and Forget (1996) cataloged 25 alpha-spectrin mutations
reported in cases of hereditary elliptocytosis and hereditary
pyropoikilocytosis. Three were splicing mutations, 1 was a 3-bp
insertion, and the remainder were missense mutations. Gallagher and
Forget (1998) tabulated 2 SPTA1 mutations that cause hereditary
spherocytosis as contrasted with 19 mutations of the beta-spectrin gene
(SPTB; 182870) that are known to cause hereditary spherocytosis.
Gallagher and Forget (1998) tabulated 2 mutations of the SPTA gene that
caused hereditary spherocytosis.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

It has repeatedly been observed that the amount of mutant alpha chain is
variable in different individuals with hereditary elliptocytosis,
resulting in clinical pictures of variable severity. In a large Algerian
family with Sp-alpha(I/65) hereditary elliptocytosis, Guetarni et al.
(1990) demonstrated that the different levels are the result of
different percentages of the alpha-spectrin allele in trans. In an
informative sibship, they found 3 persons with a distinctly high level
of expression of the variant, suggesting the existence in trans of a
low-percentage alpha-allele (called LE allele for 'low expression'). In
contrast, a basal level of expression of the variant in the same sibship
indicated the existence in trans of a normal-percentage alpha-allele.
Haplotype analysis was also used in the study. This appears to be a
superb example of an isoallele affecting the expression of the phenotype
resulting from the other allele.

Autosomal dominant elliptocytosis within the same family may be
associated with transfusion-dependent hemolytic anemia in some
heterozygotes and vigorous good health in others. Motulsky et al. (1954)
conjectured that a second genetic defect, normally silent, might be the
explanation for this apparent exception to the principles of mendelian
genetics. Parquet et al. (1994) and Randon et al. (1994) showed that, in
fact, this was the case. The explanation lies in the effects on the
assembly of the alpha-spectrin and beta-spectrin chains when a
polymorphism exists at another point in the alpha-spectrin molecule
which also contains a mutation causing elliptocytosis. The beta chain is
synthesized at an early stage of assembly of the erythrocyte
cytoskeleton and binds to its attachment site (ankyrin) on the cell
membrane. Thereafter, the alpha chain floods the system and the part not
taken up into an equimolar complex by the beta chain is destroyed by
proteases in the cytosol (Moon and Lazarides, 1983). As demonstrated by
Speicher et al. (1992), the mechanism of the lateral association of the
constituent chains of the alpha-beta spectrin dimer involves strong
interactions between pairs of repeats at one end of the dimer. Randon et
al. (1994) found that it is one of these critical repeats that is
disturbed by the alpha-LELY mutation. Delaunay and Dhermy (1993), in
Lyon, France, had shown that there is a common, but low-expression and
symptomless spectrin polymorphism resulting from a substitution toward
the far end of the alpha chain; the mutation is designated as alpha-LELY
for 'low-expression allele, Lyon.' When freshly synthesized alpha chains
are assimilated by the beta chains already on the membrane, the normal
alpha chain is preferred to the mutant. With such a high frequency of
the alpha-LELY allele in the population, a third of heterozygotes
carrying an elliptocytosis mutation at the end of the spectrin alpha
chain will also possess an alpha-LELY allele. If both mutations occur in
the same alpha chain (that is to say in cis), which will be largely
rejected by the membrane-bound beta chain, it will be the normal alpha
chain that will be predominantly incorporated into the cytoskeletal
network. In this case, the polymorphism acts to rescue the double
heterozygote from the worst consequences of the hereditary
elliptocytosis. But if the mutations occur in different alpha-chain
alleles, then the normal beta-chain binding site will carry the
defective dimer binding sites onto the membrane, and the proportion of
functional spectrin tetramers will be greatly suppressed; the malign
effects of the elliptocytic mutation will be amplified. In some milder
forms of hereditary elliptocytosis, the mutation probably only weakens
rather than annihilates the association of spectrin dimers. Even in this
case (see Perrotta et al., 1994), an offspring with an elliptocytic
alpha-chain mutation together with alpha-LELY in trans is more
noticeably affected than the father with no alpha-LELY allele. (The
situation in which a polymorphism in the gene influences the expression
of the primary disease-producing mutation is observed also in the case
of the PRNP gene (176640): the asp178-to-asn mutation causes
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease when in cis with val129 (176640.0005), whereas
it produces familial fatal insomnia when it is in cis with met129
(176640.0010).)

Randon et al. (1994) referred to the allele in cis as alpha-HE-LELY and
the diplotype in trans as alpha-HE/alpha-LELY.

Gallagher and Forget (1993) reviewed all aspects of the alpha and beta
spectrin genes in health and disease. Delaunay and Dhermy (1993)
reviewed mutations involving the spectrin heterodimer contact site which
is critical to normal self-association of spectrin. Self-association
allows the dimer to form tetramers or higher order oligomers, and
permits the whole skeleton to acquire its mechanical properties. They
referred to pyropoikilocytosis as an 'aggravated' form of
elliptocytosis. Both are defined on morphologic grounds. Hereditary
elliptocytosis shows a wide spectrum of clinical presentations, ranging
from the absence of symptoms to severe yet not life-threatening
pictures. Pyropoikilocytosis has a narrower spectrum of clinical
aspects, ranging from severe to life-threatening syndromes. They pointed
to the high incidence of so-called LE (for 'low expression') alleles of
the SPTA gene. The compound heterozygous state for an LE allele and an
HE allele (hereditary elliptocytosis) results in increased relative
expression of the latter, ending in a more severe clinical picture.
Remarkably, 4 different mutations have been found in codon 28 of SPTA1:
R28L (182860.0011), R28S (182860.0012), R28C (182860.0013), and R28H
(182860.0014). All 4 can result in severe pyropoikilocytosis if an LE
allele is present in trans. The fact that 4 mutations have been
demonstrated in codon 28 and that each of them has been found several
times suggests that the CpG dinucleotide is a hotspot for mutation.
Delaunay and Dhermy (1993) commented on the high frequency of the
leu148-dup mutation (182860.0003), also referred to as the alpha(I/65)
mutation, as well as the leu207-to-pro (182860.0016) and leu260-to-pro
(182860.0001) mutations. None of these reach as high a frequency as the
band 3 mutation accounting for Southern Asian ovalocytosis (109270.0002)
but are sufficiently frequent to raise the question of selective
advantage in relation to malaria. In vitro evidence supports this
possibility.

EVOLUTION

By database and phylogenetic analysis, Salomao et al. (2006) showed that
the SPTA1 gene is unique to mammals and that it arose through
duplication of the SPTAN1 gene (182810). They found that an SPTA1
fragment containing the site of head-to-head interaction with the
beta-chain bound more weakly than the corresponding SPTAN1 fragment, and
they identified sequences that determined the strength of the
dimer-dimer interaction on the membrane. Salomao et al. (2006) concluded
that SPTA1 is adapted for rapidly making and breaking tetramers, thus
contributing to the deformability of erythrocyte membranes.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ELLIPTOCYTOSIS 2
SPTA1, LEU260PRO

This mutation was designated LEU254PRO by Marchesi et al. (1987) and
Sahr et al. (1989). For a time the numbering system used for SPTA1 was
based on a sequence that lacked the first 6 residues.

This substitution, which resulted from a CTG-to-CCG change in exon 6,
was found in patients with elliptocytosis (130600) by Marchesi et al.
(1987) and Sahr et al. (1989). The mutation results in a Sp-alpha I/46
variant, referring to the molecular weight of the abnormal peptide
observed after limited tryptic digestion. This variant appeared to be
restricted to the areas of the Gulf of Guinea in west Africa and to be
found in closed ethnic groups.

.0002
ELLIPTOCYTOSIS 2
SPTA1, GLN471PRO

This mutation was designated GLN465PRO by Marchesi et al. (1987) and
Sahr et al. (1989). For a time the numbering system used for SPTA1 was
based on a sequence that lacked the first 6 residues.

This substitution, which resulted from a CAG-to-CCG change in exon 11,
was found in patients with elliptocytosis (130600) by Marchesi et al.
(1987) and Sahr et al. (1989). The mutation is a Sp-alpha I/50-46b
variant.

.0003
ELLIPTOCYTOSIS 2
SPTA1, 3-BP INS, LEU154DUP

Marchesi et al. (1987) and Sahr et al. (1989) stated that the
duplication occurred after leu148, but it was later found to occur after
leu154. For a time the numbering system used for SPTA1 was based on a
sequence that lacked the first 6 residues.

This mutation has also been referred to as the alpha(I-65) mutation. In
2 American black patients with elliptocytosis (130600), Marchesi et al.
(1987) and Sahr et al. (1989) found insertion of an extra leucine
residue after leucine-148. Roux et al. (1989) identified the molecular
defect in 5 unrelated families in North Africa (Algeria) with the
alpha-spectrin form of hereditary elliptocytosis. This form of
elliptocytosis is associated with an abnormal 65-kD alpha-I peptide
(rather than the normal 80-kD) following limited trypsin digestion of
whole spectrin. The authors identified an extra leucine codon (TTG)
between codons 147 and 149 in exon 4, the coding sequence becoming CAG
TTG TTG CTG instead of CAG TTG CTG. The studies of Lecomte et al. (1988)
indicated a high prevalence of hereditary elliptocytosis due to this
mutation in populations of west Africa as well as in black people living
in North America.

Boulanger et al. (1992) described fast screening methods for detection
of this and the L260P mutation (182860.0001); the findings will be
useful in studying the relationship between malaria resistance and the
LEU154DUP mutation. Del Giudice et al. (1992) reported the same mutation
in 2 women from southern Italy, Campania and Sicily; however, the
associated haplotype was the same as that encountered in African and
American blacks and in North Africans. It is assumed that the mutation
was introduced from North Africa across the Sicilian channel and
ultimately originated from the Benin-Togo area. This was the same
migratory pathway followed by the Benin type hemoglobin S allele, which
is also present in southern Italy.

.0004
ELLIPTOCYTOSIS 2
SPTA1, SER261PRO

This mutation was designated SER255PRO by Marchesi et al. (1987) and
Sahr et al. (1989). For a time the numbering system used for SPTA1 was
based on a sequence that lacked the first 6 residues.

Marchesi et al. (1987) and Sahr et al. (1989) found this substitution,
which resulted from a TCC-to-CCC change in exon 6, in patients with
elliptocytosis (130600). This mutation is a Sp-alpha I/50-46a variant.

.0005
PYROPOIKILOCYTOSIS, HEREDITARY
ELLIPTOCYTOSIS 2, INCLUDED
SPTA1, ARG45SER

This mutation was designated ARG39SER by Lecomte et al. (1989). For a
time the numbering system used for SPTA1 was based on a sequence that
lacked the first 6 residues.

In the family of a 36-year-old man with hereditary pyropoikilocytosis
(266140), Lecomte et al. (1989) found a typical mild hereditary
elliptocytosis (130600) in the mother, 2 brothers, a sister, and 2
nieces. The proband had severe neonatal hemolytic anemia requiring
exchange transfusions and a splenectomy at 1 year of age. Lecomte et al.
(1989) demonstrated a G-to-T transversion in codon 39 (AGT for AGG),
which changed the normal arginine to a serine in alpha-spectrin. This
mutation, designated spectrin Clichy, is a Sp-alpha I/78 variant.

.0006
ELLIPTOCYTOSIS 2
SPTA1, GLY46VAL

This mutation was designated GLY40VAL by Morle et al. (1989, 1990). For
a time the numbering system used for SPTA1 was based on a sequence that
lacked the first 6 residues.

Morle et al. (1989, 1990) found this substitution in a French Caucasian
family with Sp-alpha I/74 hereditary elliptocytosis (130600) defined on
the basis of altered peptide maps following partial digestion of
spectrin. The alpha-174 kD fragment is increased at the expense of the
parent alpha-I 80 kD fragment. A GGT-to-GTT change in codon 40 (in exon
2) resulted in substitution of valine for glycine. This mutation was
designated spectrin Culoz.

.0007
ELLIPTOCYTOSIS 2
SPTA1, LEU48PHE

This mutation was designated LEU43PHE by Morle et al. (1989, 1990). For
a time the numbering system used for SPTA1 was based on a sequence that
lacked the first 6 residues.

Morle et al. (1989, 1990) found this mutation in a French Caucasian
family with Sp-alpha I/74 type of hereditary elliptocytosis (130600).
The mutation, a CTT-to-TTT change in codon 43, was demonstrated by
amplification of alpha-spectrin cDNA derived from reticulocyte mRNA.
This mutation was designated spectrin Lyon.

.0008
MOVED TO 182860.0014
.0009
SPHEROCYTOSIS, TYPE 3, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
SPTA1, ALA970ASP

In the kindred with autosomal recessive spherocytosis (270970) reported
by Agre et al. (1986), Marchesi et al. (1989, 1989) identified a
CGT-to-GAT change resulting in an ala970-to-asp (A970N) substitution in
the alpha-II domain.

Boivin et al. (1993) searched for this mutation in patients with
dominant or with what the authors termed 'non-dominant' spherocytosis,
including 78 patients, 55 relatives, and 46 controls. They found that
the mutation and the HS disease gene were located on different
chromosomes and inherited independently of each other.

.0010
ELLIPTOCYTOSIS 2
SPTA1, ARG41TRP

This mutation was designated ARG35TRP by Morle et al. (1989). For a time
the numbering system used for SPTA1 was based on a sequence that lacked
the first 6 residues.

Morle et al. (1989) described spectrin Tunis, an alpha-spectrin variant
that causes asymptomatic hereditary elliptocytosis (130600) in the
heterozygous state. The variant was found in a white North African man
and his mother. Morle et al. (1989) demonstrated that a C-to-T base
substitution converted arginine-35 (CGG) to tryptophan (TGG). This
mutation is a Sp-alpha I/78 variant.

.0011
ELLIPTOCYTOSIS 2
SPTA1, ARG28LEU

In affected members of a kindred of Arab/Druze origin segregating
elliptocytosis (130600), Coetzer et al. (1991) identified a CGT-to-CTT
change resulting in substitution of leucine for arginine at codon 28 of
the SPTA1 gene. Coetzer et al. (1991) identified 3 other mutations in
codon 28 (see 182860.0012, 182860.0013, 182860.0014). All the probands
were heterozygous. All 4 point mutations abolished an AhaII restriction
enzyme site which allowed verification of linkage of the mutation with
elliptocytosis. The findings suggested that codon 28 is a hotspot for
mutations and also indicated that arginine-28 is critical for the
conformational stability and functional self-association of spectrin
heterodimers. All 4 arg28 mutations are Sp-alpha I/74 variants.

.0012
ELLIPTOCYTOSIS 2
PYROPOIKILOCYTOSIS, HEREDITARY, INCLUDED
SPTA1, ARG28SER

In affected members of 2 unrelated white kindreds of English/European
origin segregating for elliptocytosis (130600), Coetzer et al. (1991)
found a CGT-to-AGT mutation leading to substitution of serine for
arginine at codon 28 of the SPTA1 gene. See 182860.0011.

Gallagher et al. (1991) found the same mutation in a patient with
hereditary pyropoikilocytosis (266140). The patient was heterozygous for
a single structural variant of spectrin and possessed a second,
uncharacterized defect, thus explaining the difference in phenotype from
that in the patients with the same defect reported by Coetzer et al.
(1991).

.0013
ELLIPTOCYTOSIS 2
PYROPOIKILOCYTOSIS, HEREDITARY, INCLUDED
SPTA1, ARG28CYS

See 182860.0011. In affected members of 2 apparently unrelated white
kindreds from New Zealand segregating for elliptocytosis (130600),
Coetzer et al. (1991) identified a CGT-to-TGT mutation in the SPTA1 gene
that resulted in substitution of cysteine for arginine-28.

In an Italian child, Lorenzo et al. (1993) observed a de novo CGT-to-TGT
mutation at codon 28 producing severe pyropoikilocytosis (266140). The
severity of the manifestations was thought to be accounted for by the
occurrence, in trans to the alpha-28 mutation, of a polymorphism leading
to a structural abnormality of the alpha-IV/alpha-V domain junction and
with a low expression level, i.e., a so-called LE allele. The recurrent
mutation strengthens the view that codon alpha-28 is a mutational
'hotspot.'

.0014
ELLIPTOCYTOSIS 2
PYROPOIKILOCYTOSIS, HEREDITARY, INCLUDED
SPTA1, ARG28HIS

This mutation was originally reported by Garbarz et al. (1989, 1990) as
ARG22HIS (R22H). For a time the numbering system used for SPTA1 was
based on a sequence that lacked the first 6 residues.

In affected members of the French Caucasian family originally reported
by Lecomte et al. (1987), Garbarz et al. (1989, 1990) found a CAT-to-CGT
change in codon 22 in exon 2 of the SPTA1 gene (which encodes amino
acids 3 to 82 of the alpha-I domain). In the family, 12 subjects in 4
generations had a disorder of the red cells varying from mild
elliptocytosis to hemolytic elliptocytosis (130600) to
pyropoikilocytosis (266140). In 8 of the 12 affected persons,
heterozygosity for a spectrin alpha-I/74 kD defect was demonstrated by
analysis of spectrin tryptic fragments. The defect resulted in decreased
ability of the spectrin dimers to self-associate. Clinical severity
correlated with amount of mutant spectrin and excess of spectrin dimer
in the red cell membrane.

The R28H mutation was found by Baklouti et al. (1991) in a boy with
severe elliptopoikilocytosis and in his clinically normal father. The
severe expression in the son was attributable to the existence in trans
of the alpha-V/41 polymorphism transmitted from the mother.

In an American black kindred and a black kindred from Ghana, Coetzer et
al. (1991) identified a CGT-to-CAT mutation that resulted in
substitution of histidine for arginine-28. See 182860.0011.

PYROPOIKILOCYTOSIS, HEREDITARY
ELLIPTOCYTOSIS 2, INCLUDED
SPTA1, LEU207PRO

In 9 individuals from 5 unrelated families with hereditary
elliptocytosis (130600) or hereditary pyropoikilocytosis (266140),
including one of the original HPP probands reported by Zarkowsky et al.
(1975), Gallagher et al. (1992) found the alpha-I/46-50a peptide after
limited tryptic digestion of spectrin. Further studies identified a
point mutation causing the replacement of a highly conserved leucine
residue by proline at position 207 in the alpha-spectrin chain, a site
51 residues to the amino-terminal side of the abnormal proteolytic
cleavage site. Dalla Venezia et al. (1993) found the leu207-to-pro
mutation in a Moroccan family in both homozygous and heterozygous
states. The mutated allele carried, in cis, the common alpha-V/41
polymorphism, which is associated with a low expression level. Dalla
Venezia et al. (1993) suggested that the cis combination of an HE
mutation and the alpha-V/41 polymorphism accounts for the low expression
of the abnormal allele in the heterozygous state.

In the original family of Zarkowsky et al. (1975), the L207P mutation
was in compound heterozygous state with an SPTA1 allele associated with
a defect in alpha-spectrin production. By analysis of reticulocyte
alpha-spectrin cDNA from 1 of the original HPP patients, Costa et al.
(2005) identified a G-to-A transition (182860.0024) at position +5 of
the donor splice site of intron 22 of the SPTA1 gene, resulting in
insertion of intronic fragments and an in-frame premature termination
codon. Following gene transfer of the IVS22+5 mutation into tissue
culture cells, there was complete absence of normally spliced SPTA1 gene
transcript.

PYROPOIKILOCYTOSIS, HEREDITARY
SPTA1, LYS48ARG

In a case of hereditary pyropoikilocytosis (266140), Gallagher et al.
(1991) found substitution of arginine for lysine at residue 48 of
alpha-spectrin. HPP is a severe hemolytic anemia characterized by
abnormal sensitivity of red blood cells to heat and erythrocyte
morphology similar to that seen in thermal burns. The genetics of HPP
usually falls into 1 of 3 categories: (1) the patients may be homozygous
for a structural variant of spectrin; (2) they may be compound
heterozygous for 2 different structural variants of spectrin; or (3)
they may be heterozygous for a single structural variant of spectrin and
possess a second, uncharacterized defect. The patient with the
lys48-to-arg mutation was of the third type. This mutation is a Sp-alpha
I/74 variant.

.0018
ELLIPTOCYTOSIS 2
SPTA1, ASP791GLU

Alloisio et al. (1992) found an alpha-spectrin variant associated in the
heterozygous state with asymptomatic elliptocytosis (130600) and a
minimal defect in spectrin dimer self-association in a Tunisian family.
The responsible mutation was found to be a GAC-to-GAA transversion
resulting in substitution of glutamic acid for aspartic acid at codon
791. As in most alpha-spectrin variants associated with elliptocytosis,
the change altered helix 3 of the proposed triple helical model of
spectrin structure. This change was the most distant from the N terminus
of alpha-spectrin yet found in variants associated with elliptocytosis.
This mutation, designated spectrin Jendouba, is a Sp-alpha II/31
variant.

.0019
ELLIPTOCYTOSIS 2
SPTA1, IVS17, G-A, -1

In an Algerian family, Alloisio et al. (1988) identified a new
alpha-spectrin variant, spectrin Oran, that in the homozygous state
caused severe elliptocytosis (130600). All but 2 obligate heterozygotes
were clinically normal and had normal hematologic findings; one of the
exceptions 'presented some degree of anisocytosis with rare
elliptocytes' and the other had findings consistent with heterozygosity
for a form of alpha-thalassemia affecting 10% of Algerian people. As
indicated in the report of Alloisio et al. (1993), several members of
the family who were homozygotes required transfusion, and partial
splenectomy was performed at the age of 8 months in 1 of these. Alloisio
et al. (1993) demonstrated loss of amino acids 822 to 862 (helix 2 of
repeating segment alpha-8). The ultimate genetic lesion was found to be
a G-to-A transition at intronic position -1 in the acceptor splice site
of intron 17 resulting in skipping of exon 18. The substitution also
created an acceptor splice site 1 basepair downstream, but the latter
was used only to a minor extent. This mutation is a Sp-alpha II/21
variant.

.0020
ELLIPTOCYTOSIS 2
PYROPOIKILOCYTOSIS, INCLUDED
SPTA1, EX5DEL, SVA RETROTRANSPOSON INS

In a 3-generation family with hereditary elliptocytosis (130600) and
pyropoikilocytosis (266140), Hassoun et al. (1994) found a truncated
alpha-spectrin protein. They showed, furthermore, that the SPTA1 gene
had been disrupted by a mobile element resulting in exon skipping. The
element caused duplication of the insertion site and was terminated by a
long poly(A) tail downstream of multiple consensus polyadenylation
signals. Southern blot analysis of human genomic DNA, using this element
as probe, revealed 1 to 3 copies per individual. The element had no
homology to any previously reported sequence and therefore appeared to
be a member of a novel family of mobile elements. This mutation is a
Sp-alpha I/50-46a variant.

Ostertag et al. (2003) showed that the sequence change observed by
Hassoun et al. (1994) was the result of an SVA-mediated transduction
event. (Shen et al. (1994) used the term 'SVA' (SINE-R, VNTR, and alu)
to describe such a 'composite retroposon.') Ostertag et al. (2003)
showed that the de novo insertion into the alpha-spectrin gene was
caused by an SVA-mediated transduction.

PYROPOIKILOCYTOSIS, HEREDITARY
ELLIPTOCYTOSIS 2, INCLUDED
SPTA1, IVS19, T-G, -13

Lecomte et al. (1990) reported the case of a patient with severe
poikilocytic anemia, the child of apparently unrelated parents, both
from Guadeloupe in the French West Indies. The baby had severe hemolytic
anemia requiring frequent blood transfusions. Partial splenectomy was
performed at age 3, but complete splenectomy was necessary 2 years
later. Thereafter the propositus experienced a compensated hemolysis.
Blood smears showed marked poikilocytosis with spherocytes,
microspherocytes, and a few elliptocytes as observed in hereditary
pyropoikilocytosis (266140). In the patient reported by Lecomte et al.
(1990), Fournier et al. (1997) identified a splicing mutation of the
SPTA1 gene: a T-to-G transversion at nucleotide position -13 upstream of
the 3-prime acceptor splice site of exon 20. This polypyrimidine tract
mutation created a new acceptor site, AT-to-AG, and led to the
production of 2 novel mRNAs. One mRNA contained a 12-nucleotide intronic
insertion upstream of exon 20. This insertion introduced a termination
codon into the reading frame and was predicted to encode a truncated
protein that lacked the nucleation site and thus could not be assembled
in the membrane. In the other mRNA, there was in-frame skipping of exon
20, predicting a truncated alpha-spectrin chain. The homozygous
propositus had only truncated (277 kD) alpha-spectrin chains in his
erythrocyte membranes. His heterozygous parents were clinically and
biochemically normal. This allele was identified in 3% of asymptomatic
individuals from Benin, Africa, when a new MwoI restriction site was
used for identification of heterozygosity. This mutation, designated
spectrin St Claude, is a Sp-alpha II/47 variant.

Burke et al. (1998) found the same mutation in the SPTA1 gene in a South
African hereditary elliptocytosis (130600) family and referred to it as
spectrin Johannesburg. The kindred was of Afrikaner origin. Although the
parents were apparently unrelated, the probands were homozygous. Partial
spectrin deficiency in the proband's erythrocyte membranes resulted from
the spectrin-ankyrin binding defect and destabilized the lipid bilayer,
causing spherocytes. The reduced membrane spectrin content in concert
with the milder dimer self-association defect further weakened the
membrane skeleton and allowed deformation of the erythrocytes into
elliptocytes and poikilocytes. The observations illustrated how a single
point mutation in the alpha-spectrin gene impairs functions of both the
alpha- and the beta-spectrin proteins, resulting in qualitative and
quantitative membrane abnormalities.

.0022
SPHEROCYTOSIS, TYPE 3, DUE TO SPECTRIN PRAGUE
SPTA1, IVS36, A-G, -1

Wichterle et al. (1996) studied a patient with severe spherocytic
hemolytic anemia (270970) without a family history of spherocytosis.
Analysis of the patient's erythrocyte membrane proteins revealed
spectrin deficiency and a truncated alpha-spectrin protein. They
determined that the patient was a compound heterozygote with 2 mutations
in the alpha-spectrin gene. The mutation in the paternal allele,
designated alpha-spectrin-Prague, was an A-to-G transition in the
penultimate position of intron 36 that led to skipping of exon 37,
frameshift, and production of the truncated alpha-spectrin protein. The
maternal allele, designated alpha-spectrin-Lepra, contained a C-to-T
transition at position -99 of intron 30 (182860.0023). This mutation
enhanced an alternative acceptor splice site 70 nucleotides upstream
from the regular site. The alternative splicing caused a frameshift and
premature termination of translation leading to a significant decrease
in alpha-spectrin production. The spectrin-Lepra mutation was linked to
a spectrin alpha-IIa marker that was found to be associated with
recessive or nondominant spectrin-deficient hereditary spherocytosis in
approximately 50% of studied families. Wichterle et al. (1996) concluded
that the spectrin-Lepra mutation combined in trans with the alpha-Prague
mutation was responsible for the severe hemolytic anemia in the proband.
They suggested, furthermore, that the spectrin-Lepra allele may
frequently be involved in the pathogenesis of recessive or nondominant
spectrin-deficient hereditary spherocytosis.

311850	TITLE *311850 PHOSPHORIBOSYLPYROPHOSPHATE SYNTHETASE I; PRPS1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase (PRPS; EC 2.7.6.1) catalyzes the
phosphoribosylation of ribose 5-phosphate to
5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate, which is necessary for the de novo and
salvage pathways of purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis (Roessler et al.,
1990). Three PRPS genes have been identified: the widely expressed PRPS1
and PRPS2 (311860) genes, which map to chromosome Xq22-q24 and Xp22,
respectively, and PRPS3 (PRPS1L1; 611566), which maps to chromosome 7
and appears to be transcribed only in testis (Becker, 2001).

CLONING

Roessler et al. (1990) isolated a partial clone corresponding to the
PRPS1 gene from a human lymphoblast cDNA library. The deduced PRPS1
protein has 318 amino acids and shares 95% amino acid homology with
PRPS2. Becker et al. (1990) also cloned the PRPS1 gene and detected a
2.3-kb mRNA transcript.

By Northern blot analysis using rat Prps1 as probe, Taira et al. (1989)
detected a 2.3-kb transcript in human adipose tissue, testis, and
placenta and in 2 human cell lines.

Kim et al. (2007) demonstrated that the PRPS1 amino acid sequence shows
an exceptionally high degree of conservation, with homologies greater
than 95% across different species from zebrafish to human.

GENE STRUCTURE

The PRPS1 gene spans over 30 kb and contains 7 exons (Becker, 2001).

MAPPING

By the Goss-Harris method, Becker et al. (1978) concluded that the order
of loci on chromosome Xq is G6PD (305900)--HPRT1
(308000)--PRPS1--alpha-GAL (GLA; 300644)--PGK1 (311800)--centromere.
Becker et al. (1979) assigned the PRPS1 locus to a position between the
GLA and HPRT1 loci, particularly close to the latter, and discussed the
functional significance of the proximity of the genes for their
biochemically related functions.

Becker et al. (1990) mapped PRPS1 to Xq22-q24 by a combination of in
situ hybridization and study of human/rodent somatic cell hybrids.

- Pseudogene

By in situ chromosomal hybridization, Becker et al. (1990) identified a
PRPS1-related gene or pseudogene (PRPS1L2) on chromosome 9q33-q34.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

De Brouwer et al. (2010) provided a review of the clinical and molecular
features of the 4 distinct syndromes caused by mutation in the PRPS1
gene: PRPS1 superactivity (300661), X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth
disease-5 (CMTX5; 311070), Arts syndrome (301835), and isolated X-linked
sensorineural deafness (304500). The neurologic phenotype in all 4
PRPS1-related disorders seems to result primarily from reduced levels of
GTP and possibly other purine nucleotides including ATP, suggesting that
these disorders belong to the same disease spectrum. Preliminary results
of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) supplementation in 2 Australian brothers
with Arts syndrome revealed some improvement of their condition,
suggesting that SAM supplementation could potentially alleviate some of
the symptoms of patients with PRPS1 spectrum diseases by replenishing
purine nucleotides.

- Phosphoribosylpyrophosphate Synthetase Superactivity

In patients with phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase superactivity
(300661), Roessler et al. (1991, 1993) and Becker et al. (1995)
identified mutations in the PRPS1 gene (311850.0001-311850.0008). All
patients except 1 had hyperuricemia, neurodevelopmental abnormalities,
and sensorineural deafness; the other patient had only hyperuricemia and
gout. Functional expression studies of all mutations showed that enzyme
overactivity was due to alteration of allosteric feedback mechanisms.

- Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease, X-linked Recessive, 5

In affected males with X-linked recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease-5
(CMTX5; 311070), Kim et al. (2007) identified mutations in the PRPS1
gene (311850.0009; 311850.0010). The phenotype includes peripheral
neuropathy, sensorineural deafness, and visual impairment. Kim et al.
(2007) used a positional cloning technique and evaluation of candidate
genes known to be expressed in the cochlea to identify the PRPS1 gene
for study. The mutations were shown to result in decreased enzyme
activity; none of the affected individuals had increased uric acid or
gout. Kim et al. (2007) noted that both PRPS1 superactivity and CMT5X
phenotypes share neurologic features.

- Arts Syndrome

Arts syndrome (301835) is an X-linked disorder characterized by mental
retardation, early-onset hypotonia, ataxia, delayed motor development,
hearing impairment, and optic atrophy. Using oligonucleotide microarray
expression profiling of fibroblasts from 2 probands in a Dutch family
with Arts syndrome, de Brouwer et al. (2007) found reduced expression
levels of PRPS1. Sequencing of PRPS1 led to the identification of 2
different missense mutations: L152P (311850.0011) in the Dutch family
and Q133P (311850.0012) in the Australian family. Both mutations
resulted in a loss of PRPS1 activity, as was shown in silico by
molecular modeling and was shown in vitro by enzyme assays in
erythrocytes and fibroblasts from patients. This was in contrast to the
gain-of-function mutations in PRPS1 identified in PRPS-related gout. The
loss-of-function mutations of PRPS1 probably result in impaired purine
biosynthesis, which was supported by the undetectable hypoxanthine in
urine and the reduced uric acid levels in serum from patients. De
Brouwer et al. (2007) suggested that treatment with S-adenosylmethionine
(SAM) theoretically could have therapeutic efficacy to replenish low
levels of purine, and a clinical trial involving the 2 affected
Australian brothers was underway. De Brouwer et al. (2010) reported
preliminary results of the 2 Australian brothers with Arts syndrome.

- X-linked Deafness 1

In a large 5-generation Chinese family segregating X-linked nonsyndromic
hearing loss (NSHL) mapping to the DNF2 locus (DFNX1; 304500) on
chromosome Xq22, Liu et al. (2010) analyzed 14 candidate genes and
identified a missense mutation in the PRPS1 gene (D65N; 311850.0013)
that cosegregated with the phenotype. Analysis of the PRPS1 gene in a
British American DNF2 family, previously reported by Tyson et al.
(1996), revealed a different missense mutation (A87T; 311850.0014);
missense mutations were also detected in DFN2 families previously
reported by Manolis et al. (1999) and Cui et al. (2004) (311850.0015 and
311850.0016, respectively). Liu et al. (2010) stated that none of the
mutations were predicted to result in a major structural change in the
PRPS1 protein, which might explain why the disease phenotype was limited
to NSHL.

HISTORY

Wada et al. (1974) and Iinuma et al. (1975) reported a Japanese infant
with mental retardation, hypouricemia, megaloblastic changes in the bone
marrow, and orotic aciduria associated with erythrocyte PRPS deficiency.
Hypsarrhythmia was first observed at 10 months of age and markedly
improved with ACTH therapy concomitant with an increase in red cell PRPS
activity. However, studies in fibroblasts from this patient did not
confirm enzyme deficiency (Becker, 2001).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PHOSPHORIBOSYLPYROPHOSPHATE SYNTHETASE SUPERACTIVITY
PRPS1, ASN113SER

In a boy with hyperuricemia, sensorineural deafness, ataxia, and
secondary renal insufficiency associated with PRPS1 superactivity
(300661) reported by Becker et al. (1986), Roessler et al. (1991, 1993)
identified a 341A-G transition in the PRPS1 gene, resulting in an
asn113-to-ser (N113S) substitution. Biochemical studies in fibroblasts
were consistent with PRPS superactivity and purine nucleotide
feedback-resistance. The nucleotide sequence of PRPS2 cDNA was normal.

By in vitro functional expression studies in E. coli, Becker et al.
(1995) demonstrated that the N113S mutation resulted in alteration of
the allosteric mechanisms regulating both enzyme inhibition by purine
nucleotides and activation by inorganic phosphate.

.0002
PHOSPHORIBOSYLPYROPHOSPHATE SYNTHETASE SUPERACTIVITY
PRPS1, ASP182HIS

In a boy with hyperuricemia, mental retardation, and sensorineural
deafness associated with PRPS1 superactivity (300661) reported by Becker
et al. (1980), Roessler et al. (1991, 1993) identified a 547C-G
transversion in the PRPS1 gene, resulting in an asp182-to-his (D182H)
substitution. His affected mother had gout, uric acid urolithiasis, and
significant hearing loss. The nucleotide sequence of PRPS2 cDNA was
normal. Fibroblast studies of this patient and his mother (Becker et
al., 1980) indicated that the mutant enzyme had both regulatory and
catalytic defects. The enzyme showed 4- to 5-fold greater than normal
resistance to feedback inhibition and, in addition, increased maximal
velocity of the enzyme reaction. The son was hemizygous, and his mother
heterozygous, for the defect.

By in vitro functional expression studies in E. coli, Becker et al.
(1995) demonstrated that the D182H mutation resulted in alteration of
the allosteric mechanisms regulating both enzyme inhibition by purine
nucleotides and activation by inorganic phosphate.

.0003
PHOSPHORIBOSYLPYROPHOSPHATE SYNTHETASE SUPERACTIVITY
PRPS1, ASP51HIS

In a man with gout due to PRPS1 superactivity (300661) resulting from
purine nucleotide feedback-resistance (Zoref et al., 1975), Becker et
al. (1995) identified a 154G-C transversion in the PRPS1 gene, resulting
in an asp51-to-his (D51H) substitution. The patient had recurrent uric
acid lithiasis since age 14 years and severe gouty arthritis since age
20 years. His mother had increased uric acid excretion. In vitro
functional expression studies in E. coli demonstrated that the D51H
mutation resulted in alteration of the allosteric mechanisms regulating
both enzyme inhibition by purine nucleotides and activation by inorganic
phosphate.

In a boy with hyperuricemia, mental retardation, and sensorineural
deafness associated with PRPS1 superactivity (300661), Becker et al.
(1995) identified a 385C-A transversion in the PRPS1 gene, resulting in
a leu128-to-ile (L128I) substitution. In vitro functional expression
studies in E. coli demonstrated that the L128I mutation resulted in
alteration of the allosteric mechanisms regulating both enzyme
inhibition by purine nucleotides and activation by inorganic phosphate.

PHOSPHORIBOSYLPYROPHOSPHATE SYNTHETASE SUPERACTIVITY
PRPS1, ALA189VAL

In a boy with hyperuricemia, mental retardation, and sensorineural
deafness associated with PRPS1 superactivity (300661), Becker et al.
(1995) identified a 569C-T transition in the PRPS1 gene, resulting in an
ala189-to-val (A189V) substitution. In vitro functional expression
studies in E. coli demonstrated that the A189V mutation resulted in
alteration of the allosteric mechanisms regulating both enzyme
inhibition by purine nucleotides and activation by inorganic phosphate.

.0008
PHOSPHORIBOSYLPYROPHOSPHATE SYNTHETASE SUPERACTIVITY
PRPS1, HIS192GLN

In a boy with hyperuricemia, mental retardation, and sensorineural
deafness associated with PRPS1 superactivity (300661), Becker et al.
(1995) identified a 579C-G transversion in the PRPS1 gene, resulting in
a his192-to-gln (H192Q) substitution. In vitro functional expression
studies in E. coli demonstrated that the H192Q mutation resulted in
alteration of the allosteric mechanisms regulating both enzyme
inhibition by purine nucleotides and activation by inorganic phosphate.

.0009
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, X-LINKED RECESSIVE, 5
PRPS1, GLU43ASP

In 2 affected brothers with X-linked recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth
disease-5 (311070), Kim et al. (2007) identified a 129A-C transversion
in exon 2 of the PRPS1 gene, resulting in a glu43-to-asp (E43D)
substitution on the 'flag' region of the N-terminal domain. The affected
residue is highly conserved from zebrafish to human, and the mutation
was not observed in 50 unrelated Caucasian individuals or in 1,103
Korean control chromosomes. None of the affected individuals had
increased uric acid production or gout.

.0010
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, X-LINKED RECESSIVE, 5
PRPS1, MET115THR

In affected members of a Korean family with CMTX5 (311070), Kim et al.
(2007) identified a 344T-C transition in exon 3 of the PRPS1 gene,
resulting in a met115-to-thr (M115T) substitution in the alpha-helix of
the N-terminal domain. The affected residue is highly conserved from
zebrafish to human, and the mutation was not observed in 1,103 Korean
control chromosomes. In vitro functional expression studies showed that
the M115T mutation resulted in partial loss of enzyme function. None of
the affected individuals had increased uric acid production or gout.

.0011
ARTS SYNDROME
PRPS1, LEU152PRO

In a Dutch family with Arts syndrome (301835) originally reported by
Arts et al. (1993), de Brouwer et al. (2007) found that the disorder was
associated with a 455T-C transition in exon 4 of the PRPS1 gene that
resulted in a leu152-to-pro (L152P) substitution.

.0012
ARTS SYNDROME
PRPS1, GLN133PRO

In an Australian family with Arts syndrome (301835), de Brouwer et al.
(2007) found that the disorder was caused by a 398A-C transversion in
exon 3 of the PRPS1 gene that resulted in a gln133-to-pro (Q133P)
substitution. Enzyme assays and molecular modeling demonstrated loss of
function of the mutant protein.

.0013
DEAFNESS, X-LINKED 1
PRPS1, ASP65ASN

In affected members of a large 5-generation Chinese family segregating
X-linked deafness-1 (304500), Liu et al. (2010) identified a 193G-A
transition in exon 2 of the PRPS1 gene, resulting in an asp65-to-asn
(D65N) substitution at a highly conserved residue in the alpha helix at
the N terminus. The mutation was not found in 1,025 ethnically matched
control chromosomes. Enzymatic activity assays showed reductions of
PRPS1 activity in patient erythrocytes of approximately 40 to 70% and in
patient fibroblasts of approximately 50 to 60% compared to controls.

DEAFNESS, X-LINKED 1
PRPS1, ALA87THR

In affected members of a British American family segregating X-linked
deafness-1 (304500), previously reported by Tyson et al. (1996), Liu et
al. (2010) identified a 259G-A transition in exon 2 of the PRPS1 gene,
resulting in an ala87-to-thr (A87T) substitution at a highly conserved
residue. The mutation was not found in 1,475 Chinese control chromosomes
or 450 chromosomes of European descent.

In affected members of an American family segregating X-linked
deafness-1 (304500), previously reported by Manolis et al. (1999), Liu
et al. (2010) identified a 916G-A transition in exon 7 of the PRPS1
gene, resulting in a gly306-to-arg (G306R) substitution at a highly
conserved residue. The mutation was not found in 1,475 Chinese control
chromosomes or 450 chromosomes of European descent.

In affected members from a Chinese family segregating X-linked
postlingual nonsyndromic hearing loss (DFNX1; 304500), previously
reported by Cui et al. (2004), Liu et al. (2010) identified an 869T-C
transition in exon 7 of the PRPS1 gene, resulting in an ile290-to-thr
(I290T) substitution at a highly conserved residue. The mutation was not
found in 1,025 ethnically matched control chromosomes.

ARTS SYNDROME AND PHOSPHORIBOSYLPYROPHOSPHATE SYNTHETASE SUPERACTIVITY
PRPS1, VAL142LEU

In a boy with a complex phenotype comprising Arts syndrome and PRPS1
superactivity (see 301835), Moran et al. (2012) identified a 424G-C
transversion in exon 4 of the PRPS1 gene, resulting in a val142-to-leu
(V142L) substitution at a highly conserved residue. Both the mother and
grandmother were heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found in
202 control alleles. The patient had developmental delay, hypotonia,
areflexia, motor neuropathy, sensorineural hearing loss, and a Chiari I
malformation. Laboratory studies showed increased serum uric acid and
increased urinary hypoxanthine consistent with PRPS1 superactivity, but
he did not have gout. In addition, he had recurrent infections and early
death at age 27 months from infection, consistent with Arts syndrome. A
maternal uncle with similar symptoms had died of pneumonia at age 2.
Molecular modeling predicted that the substitution would disrupt
allosteric sites involved in inhibition of PRPS1, resulting in a gain of
enzyme function, and the ATP-binding site, resulting in a loss of enzyme
function. Patient fibroblasts showed normal PRPP synthetase activity,
whereas erythrocytes showed a loss of enzyme activity, suggesting that
the effect of the V142L mutation on protein activity depends on cell
type. Moran et al. (2012) postulated a gain-of-function effect in
proliferating cells and a loss-of-function effect in postmitotic cells.
The report indicated that PRPS1 missense mutations can cause a
continuous spectrum of features ranging from progressive nonsyndromic
postlingual hearing impairment to uric acid overproduction, neuropathy,
and recurrent infections depending on the functional sites affected.

608977	TITLE *608977 DNAJ/HSP40 HOMOLOG, SUBFAMILY C, MEMBER 19; DNAJC19
;;TRANSLOCASE OF INNER MITOCHONDRIAL MEMBRANE 14, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF;
TIM14
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for sequences similar to yeast Tim14, Mokranjac et al.
(2003) identified human TIM14. The deduced 116-amino acid protein
contains an N-terminal transmembrane domain, followed by 3 alpha-helical
segments characteristic of the J domain of E. coli DnaJ (see 608375). In
yeast, Tim14 is located at the inner mitochondrial membrane and the J
domain faces the matrix space.

Using RT-PCR on total RNA isolated from fibroblasts, Davey et al. (2006)
detected a dominant full-length 525-bp product as well as a minor 445-bp
product lacking exon 4 in all tissues examined. The full-length protein
has a predicted molecular mass of 12.5 kD. They identified a single
N-terminal transmembrane segment, a predicted mitochondrial targeting
sequence, and a C-terminal J domain,

GENE FUNCTION

Mokranjac et al. (2003) determined that yeast Tim14 is a component of
the mitochondrial protein import motor. They found that Tim14 interacts
with Hsp70 (see 140550) in an ATP-dependent manner and has a profound
effect on the interaction of Hsp70 with Tim44 (605058).

Sinha et al. (2010) showed that human MAGMAS (PAM16; 614336) is an
ortholog of S. cerevisiae Pam16; it has similar functions and is
critical for protein translocation across the mitochondrial inner
membrane. MAGMAS localized to mitochondria and was peripherally
associated with inner mitochondrial membrane in yeast and humans. MAGMAS
formed a stable subcomplex with DNAJC19 through its C-terminal region
and was tethered to the TIM23 (605034) complex of yeast and humans.
Sinha et al. (2010) proposed that mutations resulting in decreased
stability of functional MAGMAS:DNAJC19 subcomplex at the human TIM23
channel may lead to impaired protein import and cellular respiration in
some patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.

GENE STRUCTURE

Davey et al. (2006) determined that the DNAJC19 gene contains 6 exons
spanning 5.2 kb.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the DNAJC19
gene to chromosome 3 (TMAP SHGC-77577).

Davey et al. (2006) noted that the DNAJC19 gene maps to chromosome
3q26.33.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 16 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and ataxia, also called
3-methylglutaconic aciduria type V (MGCA5; 610198), from a Canadian
Dariusleut Hutterite population, Davey et al. (2006) identified
homozygosity for a splice-site mutation in the DNAJC19 gene
(608977.0001).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
3-@METHYLGLUTACONIC ACIDURIA, TYPE V
DNAJC19, IVS3, G-C, -1 (dbSNP rs137854888)

In 16 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and ataxia (610198) from
consanguineous Canadian Dariusleut Hutterite families, Davey et al.
(2006) identified homozygosity for a -1G-C transversion in intron 3 of
the DNAJC19 gene, predicted to prevent splicing of exon 4 into the
DNAJC19 mRNA (delta-ex4). By expression analysis, a dominant full-length
545-bp product and a minor 445-bp product corresponding to delta-ex4
were detected in normal tissues and in a non-Hutterite control subject.
In an affected patient, only the 445-bp product was detected. Davey et
al. (2006) suggested that alternative splicing is common at this site.
Unaffected parents were heterozygous for the mutation; the mutation was
not found in 236 controls.

Chong et al. (2012) identified this mutation in heterozygous state in 42
individuals among 1,504 U.S. Schmiedeleut (S-leut) Hutterites screened,
for a carrier frequency of 0.028 (1 in 36). No homozygotes for this
mutation were identified. This is a private mutation in the Hutterite
population.

612962	TITLE *612962 DYNACTIN 5; DCTN5
;;p25
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Dynactin (see 601143) is a multimeric protein essential for
minus-end-directed transport driven by the microtubule-based motor
dynein (see DYNC1H1; 600112). DCTN5 is a subunit of the pointed-end
subcomplex of dynactin that is thought to interact with membranous cargo
(Parisi et al., 2004).

CLONING

Eckley et al. (1999) identified Dctn5, which they called p25, as a
component of the pointed-end dynactin subcomplex in bovine brain. By
database analysis, they identified mouse p25, which encodes a 182-amino
acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 20.1 kD. Eckley et al.
(1999) also identified p25 orthologs in fly and worm.

By searching databases for proteins containing an isoleucine-patch motif
predicted to adopt a left-handed parallel beta-helix fold, Parisi et al.
(2004) identified mouse p25.

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the DCTN5 gene to chromosome 16p12.2 based on an
alignment of the DCTN5 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK027387) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Levedakou et al. (1994) used degenerate PCR to clone a novel
serine/threonine protein kinase, termed STK2, from a human breast
carcinoma cell line. The gene encodes an 841-amino acid polypeptide.
Northern blot analysis revealed that the STK2 gene is expressed as 2
mRNAs of 4.0 kb and 6.8 kb in heart and several other tissues. Levedakou
et al. (1994) noted that levels of STK2 mRNA remain invariant throughout
the cell cycle.

MAPPING

By PCR amplification on DNA from a panel of monochromosomal human-rodent
hybrids, Levedakou et al. (1994) mapped the NEK4 gene to chromosome
3p21.1.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) functions as a neuromodulator and/or trophic
factor in the central nervous system. Glutathione (GSH)-independent PGD
synthase catalyzes the conversion of prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) to PGD2 in
the presence of various sulfhydryl compounds. The enzyme is responsible
for biosynthesis of PGD2 in the brain (Nagata et al., 1991).

CLONING

Nagata et al. (1991) isolated cDNAs for GSH-independent PGD2 synthase
from cDNA libraries of human brain. The longest insert contained a
coding region of 570 basepairs corresponding to 190 amino acid residues
with a calculated molecular mass of 21,016.

GENE FUNCTION

Tanaka et al. (1997) analyzed the binding of recombinant rat brain Ptgds
to retinoids by measuring fluorescence, UV, and circular dichroism
spectra after incubation of Ptgds with various isoforms of retinoid.
They found that Ptgds binds all-trans-retinoic acid, 9-cis-retinoic
acid, all-trans-retinal, and 13-cis-retinal, but not all-trans-retinol,
with affinities sufficient for function as a retinoid transporter.
All-trans-retinoic acid inhibited Ptgds activity in a noncompetitive
manner, suggesting that it binds to the same hydrophobic pocket as PGH2,
the substrate for Ptgds, but at a different site in this pocket. Tanaka
et al. (1997) suggested that PTGDS is a bifunctional protein that acts
as both a retinoid transporter and a PGD2-producing enzyme.

Kanekiyo et al. (2007) detected PTGDS within amyloid plaques in the
brain of a human patient with late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD; 104300)
and in mouse models of AD. In vitro studies showed that human PTGDS
inhibited the aggregation of beta-amyloid (APP; 104760) fibrils in a
dose-dependent manner. Ptgds-knockout mice showed acceleration of brain
beta-amyloid deposition, and transgenic mice overexpressing human PTGDS
showed decreased amyloid deposition, compared to wildtype. Since PTGDS
is present in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), Kanekiyo et al. (2007)
concluded that PTGDS acts as an endogenous beta-amyloid chaperone by
binding to a particular area of APP and preventing a conformational
shape change from soluble to insoluble peptides. The findings suggested
that quantitative or qualitative changes in PTGDS may be involved in the
pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease.

Both SRY (480000) and SOX9 (608160) are necessary for testis development
in humans and mice. Prostaglandin D2 contributes to the development of
the testis by recruiting cells of the supporting cell lineage to a
Sertoli cell fate (Wilhelm et al., 2005). Wilhelm et al. (2007) found
that Pgds was expressed in embryonic mouse Sertoli cells immediately
after the onset of Sry and Sox9 expression. Pgds upregulation was
mediated by Sox9, but not Sry, and required the binding of dimeric Sox9
to a paired SOX recognition site within the Pgds 5-prime flanking
region.

GENE STRUCTURE

White et al. (1992) isolated the PTGDS gene from a genomic library. It
spans 3,600 bp and contains 7 exons. The transcriptional start site was
mapped to a G residue 74 bp 5-prime of the ATG initiation codon. A TATA
box-like element (ATAAATA) was situated 21 bp upstream of the mRNA start
site. The gene for PGDS had a close structural resemblance to those for
murine major urinary protein (MUP) and ovine beta-lactoglobulin.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), White et al. (1992)
localized the PGDS2 gene to 9q34.2-q34.3. By dual-color FISH, they
demonstrated the following order: cen--HXB (187380)--ABL
(189980)--PGDS--tel. Southern blot analysis indicated that there is a
single copy of the gene in the haploid genome.

By linkage analyses in an interspecific backcross progeny in the mouse,
Chan et al. (1994) mapped the Ptgds gene to chromosome 2 in a region of
homology to human 9q34 and in the same region as other genes of the
lipocalin family. By interspecific backcross linkage analysis, Pilz et
al. (1995) mapped the Ptgds gene to mouse chromosome 2.

Miwa et al. (2004) identified 6 SNPs in the LPGDS gene in a Japanese
population, including a common 4111A-C SNP in the 3-prime UTR. Serum
levels of high density lipoprotein were significantly higher in
individuals with the AA genotype of 4111A-C compared with those with the
AC or CC genotypes. The maximum intima-media thickness in the common
carotid artery (CIMT-max) was significantly smaller in subjects with the
AA genotype than in those with AC or CC. Logistic regression analysis
revealed that the presence of the AA genotype significantly reduced the
risk for increased CIMT-max, even after adjustment for other risk
factors. Miwa et al. (2004) concluded that the 4111A-C SNP in the LPGDS
gene contributes to development of carotid atherosclerosis in Japanese
hypertensive patients.

ANIMAL MODEL

Pinzar et al. (2000) noted that PGD2 is the most abundant prostanoid
produced in the central nervous system of mammals and one of the most
potent sleep-inducing substances. It induces excess sleep in rats and
monkeys after intracerebral ventricular infusion. Sleep induced by PGD2
is indistinguishable from physiologic sleep, as judged by
electroencephalogram (EEG), electromyogram (EMG), brain temperature,
locomotor activities, heart rate, and general behavior of animals (Onoe
et al., 1988). PGD2 is produced in the arachidonic acid cascade from a
common precursor of various prostanoids, PGH2, by the action of PTGDS.
In the CNS, PGDS is produced mainly in the leptomeninges and choroid
plexus and secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid as beta-trace, the
second most abundant protein in CSF after albumin. To examine the
function of PTGDS, as well as endogenously produced PGD2 in sleep
regulation in vivo, Pinzar et al. (2000) generated transgenic mice that
overexpressed the human PTGDS gene to study their sleep behavior.
Although no differences were observed in the sleep/wake patterns between
wildtype and transgenic mice, a striking time-dependent increase in
nonrapid eye movement (NREM), but not in rapid eye movement (REM), sleep
was observed in 2 independent lines of transgenic mice after stimulation
by tail clipping. Concomitantly, the spontaneous locomotor activity of
transgenic mice was drastically decreased in response to the tail clip.
Induction of NREM sleep in transgenic mice was positively correlated
with the PGD2 production in the brain. Sleep, locomotion, and PGD2
content were essentially unchanged in wildtype mice after tail clipping.
The results demonstrated the involvement of the PTGDS gene in the
regulation of NREM sleep. Thus, the PTGDS gene appears to be responsible
for the regulation of NREM sleep, in contrast to the orexin/hypocretin
gene (HCRT; 602358), which is involved in the pathogenesis of narcolepsy
and possibly in the regulation of REM sleep.

Ragolia et al. (2005) found that Lpgds-knockout mice became glucose
intolerant and insulin resistant at an accelerated rate compared with
controls. Adipocytes were significantly larger in Lpgds-knockout mice
compared with controls on the same diets. Cell culture data revealed
significant differences between insulin-stimulated MAP kinase
phosphatase-2 (DUSP4; 602747), protein tyrosine phosphatase-1D (PTPN21;
603271), and phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (PTK2; 600758)
expression levels in Lpgds-knockout vascular smooth muscle cells and
controls. Only Lpgds-knockout mice developed nephropathy and an aortic
thickening reminiscent of the early stages of atherosclerosis when fed a
'diabetogenic' diet.

Qu et al. (2006) found that selenium tetrachloride (SeCl4), an inhibitor
of prostaglandin D synthase, inhibited sleep in wildtype mice
dose-dependently and immediately after administration. SeCl4-induced
insomnia was observed in hematopoietic Pgds (HPGDS; 602598)-knockout
mice, but not in Lpgds-knockout mice, Lpgds/Hpgds double-knockout mice,
or prostaglandin D receptor (PTGDR; 604687)-knockout mice.
Administration of a Ptgdr antagonist reduced sleep of rats by 30%.

Philibert et al. (2013) found that 24% of Ptgds -/- mice and 16% of
Ptgds +/- mice presented with random unilateral undescended testes. All
other parts of the male reproductive system appeared normal. The
undescended testis located cranially to the inguinal canal in a
suprascrotal position. The phenotype was accompanied by decreased Rxfp2
(606655) mRNA expression in the gubernaculum and was similar to that
observed in mice with conditional inactivation of androgen receptor (AR;
313700) in the gubernaculum.

615110	TITLE *615110 WD REPEAT-CONTAINING PROTEIN 53; WDR53
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

WDR53 is predicted to be an adaptor protein that regulates the
interactions of other proteins with the CUL4 (see 603137)-DDB1 (600045)
ubiquitin E3 ligase complex (Higa et al., 2006).

CLONING

By mass spectrometric analysis of proteins that interacted with the
CUL4-DDB1 complex in human cell lines, Higa et al. (2006) identified
WDR53. The deduced protein is predicted to have a large central WD40
repeat domain and short N- and C-terminal tails.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the WDR53 gene to chromosome 3q29 based on an
alignment of the WDR53 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC054030) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

171840	TITLE *171840 PHOSPHOFRUCTOKINASE, PLATELET TYPE; PFKP
;;PFK, PLATELET TYPE;;
PFK, FIBROBLAST TYPE; PFKF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The PFKP gene encodes the platelet isoform of phosphofructokinase (PFK)
(ATP:D-fructose-6-phosphate-1-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.11). PFK
catalyzes the irreversible conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to
fructose-1,6-bisphosphate and is a key regulatory enzyme in glycolysis.
The PFKP gene, which maps to chromosome 10p, is also expressed in
fibroblasts. See also the muscle (PFKM; 610681) and liver (PFKL; 171860)
isoforms of phosphofructokinase, which map to chromosomes 12q13 and
21q22, respectively.

Vora (1981) determined that full tetrameric phophofructokinase enzyme
expressed in platelets can be composed of subunits P4, P3L, and P2L2.

CLONING

Simpson and Fothergill-Gilmore (1991) isolated a cDNA corresponding to
the PFKP gene from a human lymphocyte Raji cell line cDNA library using
a cDNA for human muscle PFK as a probe. The deduced amino acid sequence
showed 71% identity to the amino acid sequence for the human muscle
isoenzyme and 63% identity to the human liver isoenzyme.

GENE FUNCTION

Yi et al. (2012) demonstrated that the dynamic posttranslational
modification of proteins by O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine
(O-GlcNAcylation) is a key metabolic regulator of glucose metabolism.
O-GlcNAcylation was induced at ser529 of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1) in
response to hypoxia. Glycosylation inhibited PFK1 activity and
redirected glucose flux through the pentose phosphate pathway, thereby
conferring a selective growth advantage on cancer cells. Blocking
glycosylation of PFK1 at ser529 reduced cancer cell proliferation in
vitro and impaired tumor formation in vivo.

MAPPING

Weil et al. (1980) developed a method of specific immunoprecipitation of
human PFK and used it to locate the structural gene for fibroblast PFK
(PFKF) to chromosome 10 in somatic cell hybrids. Vora et al. (1983)
assigned the PFKP gene to 10p by use of a mouse antihuman
P-subunit-specific antiserum in the study of human/rodent somatic cell
hybrids. A single discordant hybrid cell containing only 10q did not
express PFKP, and fibroblasts from a patient with duplication of 10p
exhibited PFK activity values 180% of normal.

Schwartz et al. (1984) confirmed the assignment of PFKP and hexokinase-1
(HK1; 142600) to 10p by dosage effects in a case of 10p partial trisomy.
The synteny of PFKP and HK1 may have functional significance because the
enzymes which they encode are the primary and secondary control points
of the glycolytic pathway.

By use of the cDNA clone as a biotinylated probe for in situ
hybridization to human chromosome spreads, Morrison et al. (1992)
assigned the PFKP gene to chromosome 10p15.3-p15.2.

NOMENCLATURE

Francke (1983) suggested that this form of PFK is best called the
'platelet' type and symbolized PFKP because it is the only form made by
platelets, whereas fibroblasts have more than one form of PFK.

;;LATE ENVELOPE PROTEIN 12; LEP12
DESCRIPTION For background information on the LCE gene cluster, see 612603.

CLONING

By database analysis to identify human orthologs of mouse genes encoding
late envelope proteins (LEPs), Marshall et al. (2001) identified LCE2D,
which they called LEP12.

Using real-time PCR, Jackson et al. (2005) detected low LCE2D expression
in human fetal, arm, penal, and abdominal skin, as well as in vulva and
esophagus, but not in tongue.

GENE FUNCTION

Jackson et al. (2005) showed that expression of LCE2 genes, including
LCE2D, was upregulated in cultured normal human keratinocytes by both
ultraviolet irradiation and calcium.

GENE STRUCTURE

Jackson et al. (2005) determined that the LCE2D gene contains 2 exons.
Exon 1 is noncoding.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Marshall et al. (2001) mapped the LCE2D
gene within the LCE gene cluster on chromosome 1q21. Jackson et al.
(2005) stated that the mouse Lce2d gene maps to a syntenic LCE gene
cluster on chromosome 3F1.

612878	TITLE *612878 EXOPHILIN 5; EXPH5
;;SYNAPTOTAGMIN-LIKE PROTEIN LACKING C2 DOMAINS B; SLAC2B;;
KIAA0624
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Ishikawa et al. (1998) cloned EXPH5, which they designated
KIAA0624. The deduced protein contains 1,983 amino acids. RT-PCR
detected highest EXPH5 expression in kidney, followed by lung, brain,
liver, and ovary. Little to no expression was detected in skeletal
muscle or spleen. Kuroda et al. (2002) showed that EXPH5, which they
called SLAC2B, contains an N-terminal synaptotagmin (see SYT1,
185605)-like homology domain (SHD).

By semiquantitative RT-PCR, McGrath et al. (2012) demonstrated
expression of EXPH5 in skin, muscle, heart, and brain. No amplification
was achieved from kidney, liver, or lung.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1998) mapped the EXPH5
gene to chromosome 11.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a protein pull-down assay, Kuroda et al. (2002) found that the
isolated N-terminal SHD of human SLAC2B and mouse Slp2a (SYTL2; 612880)
bound RAB27A (603868), but no other small GTP-binding protein examined.
Coimmunoprecipitation analysis confirmed that full-length SLAC2B and
SLP2A interacted specifically with RAB27A following transfection of
COS-7 cells.

McGrath et al. (2012) examined the cytoskeletal architecture of
keratinocytes from patients with a truncating mutation in the EXPH5 gene
(612878.0001) compared to SLAC2B-knockdown control keratinocytes, and
observed disruption of the keratin filament network and more cortically
distributed F-actin in both compared to wildtype. Keratinocyte adhesion
assays demonstrated significantly reduced cell adhesion in both mutant
and knockdown keratinocytes compared to controls. SLAC2B was also
observed to colocalize with RAB27B (603869) and beta-4-integrin (147557)
to early adhesion initiation sites in spreading normal keratinocytes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 affected sibs from a consanguineous Iraqi family segregating
autosomal recessive inherited skin fragility (615028) with
clinicopathologic features that were not diagnostic for any particular
subtype of epidermolysis bullosa (see 601001) and who were negative for
mutation in the KRT5 (148040) and KRT14 (148066) genes, McGrath et al.
(2012) identified homozygosity for a 1-bp deletion (612878.0001) in the
EXPH5 gene.

In 3 affected sibs from a consanguineous Iraqi family with inherited
skin fragility (615028), McGrath et al. (2012) identified homozygosity
for a 1-bp deletion (5786delC) in exon 6 of the EXPH5 gene, causing a
frameshift predicted to result in a premature termination codon
truncating the protein by 52 residues (Pro1929LeufsX8). The mutation
segregated with disease in the family and was not found in 200 control
chromosomes from mixed Iraqi, Iranian, Kuwaiti, and Omani populations.
Patient keratinocytes showed disruption of the keratin filament network
and more cortically distributed F-actin as well as significantly reduced
cell adhesion compared to wildtype keratinocytes.

610813	TITLE *610813 HYDROCEPHALUS-INDUCING, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF, 2; HYDIN2
;;HYDIN, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF, 2;;
KIAA1864
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2001) cloned HYDIN2, which they designated
KIAA1864. RT-PCR ELISA detected moderate HYDIN2 expression in adult and
fetal brain, spinal cord, and all specific brain regions examined. Lower
expression was detected in lung, kidney, testis, and ovary, and little
to no expression was detected in other tissues examined.

By genomic sequence analysis, Doggett et al. (2006) identified a
duplicated copy of HYDIN (610812), HYDIN2, on chromosome 1. Database and
sequence analyses revealed HYDIN transcripts that had been isolated from
lung, testis, NT2 neuronal precursor cells, and Jurkat leukemic T cells,
whereas HYDIN2 transcripts had been isolated from brain and NT2 cells
only. Both genes appeared to be expressed as alternatively spliced
transcripts.

GENE STRUCTURE

Doggett et al. (2006) determined that the HYDIN2 gene contains 79 exons
and spans approximately 360 kb. It lacks the first 5 exons and last 2
exons of the HYDIN gene.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2001) mapped the HYDIN2
gene to both chromosome 1 and chromosome 16. By genomic sequence
analysis, Doggett et al. (2006) determined that the HYDIN2 gene maps to
chromosome 1q21.1 and is a duplicated copy of the HYDIN gene on
chromosome 16q22.2.

EVOLUTION

Using PCR and FISH, Doggett et al. (2006) confirmed that duplication of
the HYDIN gene is specific to humans. A large and diverse sample of
humans contained both HYDIN and HYDIN2, and there was no evidence for
polymorphic presence of HYDIN2.

Brunetti-Pierri et al. (2008) found that patients with 1q21 deletion
phenotype (612474) had microcephaly, whereas patients with
microduplication of this region (612475) had macrocephaly. They
postulated that dosage sensitivity of the HYDIN2 gene was responsible
for the variation in head circumference.

POPULATION GENETICS

By analyzing short-read mapping depth for 159 human genomes, Sudmant et
al. (2010) demonstrated accurate estimation of absolute copy number for
duplications as small as 1.9 kb pairs, ranging from 0 to 48 copies.
Sudmant et al. (2010) identified 4.1 million 'singly unique nucleotide'
positions informative in distinguishing specific copies and used them to
genotype the copy and content of specific paralogs within highly
duplicated gene families. These data identified human-specific
expansions in genes associated with brain development, such as GPRIN2
(611240) and SRGAP2 (606524), which have been implicated in neurite
outgrowth and branching. Also included were the brain-specific HYDIN2
gene, associated with micro- and macrocephaly; DRD5 (126453), a dopamine
D5 receptor; and the GTF2I (601679) transcription factors, whose
deletion has been associated with visual-spatial and sociability
deficits among Williams-Beuren syndrome (194050) patients, among others.
The data of Sudmant et al. (2010) also revealed extensive population
genetic diversity, especially among the genes NPEPPS (606793), UGT2B17
(601903), and NBPF1 (610501), as well as LILRA3 (604818), which is the
most highly stratified gene by copy number in the human genome. In
addition, Sudmant et al. (2010) detected signatures consistent with gene
conversion in the human species.

606907	TITLE *606907 APOLIPOPROTEIN M; APOM
;;NG20, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Xu and Dahlback (1999) identified APOM through N-terminal sequencing of
proteins associated with triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TGRLP). By
searching 2 liver cDNA libraries with probes designed from an EST
containing the sequence, they cloned human APOM. The deduced 188-amino
acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of about 21 kD. It contains
a potential N-glycosylation site, 2 possible disulfide bridges, and a
hydrophobic alpha-helical signal peptide that is retained in the mature
protein. Sequence analysis revealed 79% identity between the human and
mouse proteins. Northern blot analysis by Xu and Dahlback (1999)
detected restricted expression of a 750-bp transcript in liver and
kidney. Northern blot analysis of several cell lines by Albertella et
al. (1996) detected a 1.1-kb transcript in HepG2 liver cells but not in
human fibroblast, leukocyte, or monocytic cell lines. By Western blot
analysis, Xu and Dahlback (1999) found that APOM is a minor component of
high and low density lipoproteins as well as TGRLP. In vitro translation
in the presence of microsomes resulted in a protein of 26 kD, suggesting
that APOM is translocated through the membrane and glycosylated.

GENE STRUCTURE

By Southern blot analysis, Albertella et al. (1996) determined that APOM
is present in single copy in the genome.

MAPPING

By homology with the corresponding mouse gene, Ng20, which maps to
chromosome 17, and by sequence analysis, Xu and Dahlback (1999) mapped
the human APOM gene to chromosome 6p21.3, between the BAT3 (142590) and
BAT4 (142610) genes.

ANIMAL MODEL

Wolfrum et al. (2005) demonstrated that mice deficient in Apom
accumulated cholesterol in large HDL particles while the conversion of
HDL to pre-beta-HDL was impaired, leading to a markedly reduced
cholesterol efflux from macrophages to Apom-deficient HDL compared to
normal HDL in vitro. Overexpression of Apom in low density lipoprotein
receptor (LDLR; 606945)-null mice protected against atherosclerosis when
the mice were challenged with a cholesterol-enriched diet. Wolfrum et
al. (2005) concluded that APOM is important for the formation of
pre-beta-HDL and cholesterol efflux to HDL, and thereby inhibits
formation of atherosclerotic lesions.

613764	TITLE *613764 SECRETORY CARRIER MEMBRANE PROTEIN 4; SCAMP4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Secretory carrier membrane proteins (SCAMPs) are widely distributed
integral membrane proteins implicated in membrane trafficking. Most
SCAMPs (e.g., SCAMP1; 606911) have N-terminal cytoplasmic NPF
(arg-pro-phe) repeats, 4 central transmembrane regions, and a short
C-terminal cytoplasmic tail. These SCAMPs likely have a role in
endocytosis that is mediated by their NPF repeats. Other SCAMPs, such as
SCAMP4, lack the NPF repeats and are therefore unlikely to function in
endocytosis (summary by Fernandez-Chacon and Sudhof, 2000).

CLONING

By searching EST databases, Fernandez-Chacon and Sudhof (2000)
identified mouse Scamp4. The deduced 230-amino acid mouse protein
contains 4 transmembrane domains that are highly conserved among other
SCAMPs, with little conservation at the N- and C-terminal ends. Scamp4
lacks the N-terminal NPF repeats found in several other SCAMPs. Northern
blot analysis revealed variable expression of Scamp4 in all rat tissues
examined, with highest expression in testis and liver.

Krebs and Pfaff (2001) cloned rat Scamp4. The deduced protein lacks the
calcium-binding, leucine zipper, and NPF motifs found in other SCAMPs,
but it has a putative protein kinase C (PKC; see 176960) phosphorylation
site. In situ hybridization showed that Scamp4 mRNA was relatively low
in female rat forebrain, with highest levels in ventromedial
hypothalamus, habenula, and hippocampus.

GENE FUNCTION

Using differential display PCR, Krebs and Pfaff (2001) found reduced
expression of Scamp4 mRNA in the ventromedial hypothalamus of female rat
brains after progesterone treatment, following estrogen priming. In situ
hybridization showed that Scamp4 mRNA was less abundant in habenula and
ventromedial hypothalamus during proestrus, when circulating levels of
estrogen and progesterone are at their peak, than during diestrus-1,
when circulating hormone levels are low. Krebs and Pfaff (2001) noted
that Scamp4 mRNA levels are high in habenula, a brain area rich in mast
cells that may be involved in courtship behavior. They suggested that
SCAMP4 may be involved in reproductive behaviors associated with mast
cell activity in the central nervous system.

MAPPING

Gross (2011) mapped the SCAMP4 gene to chromosome 19p13.3 based on an
alignment of the SCAMP4 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC011747) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

614075	TITLE #614075 HERMANSKY-PUDLAK SYNDROME 6; HPS6
DESCRIPTION A number sign (#) is used with this entry because this form of
Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS6) is caused by homozygous or compound
heterozygosity for mutation in the HPS6 gene (607522) on chromosome
10q24.32.

For a phenotypic description and a discussion of genetic heterogeneity
of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, see HPS1, 203300.

CLINICAL FEATURES

Zhang et al. (2003) described a 39-year-old Belgian woman with
Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome-6. She had oculocutaneous albinism and
frequent prolonged nosebleeds, as well as prolonged bleeding after
dental extractions and surgery. She had no pulmonary or gastrointestinal
symptoms. Her platelet count was normal, and her bleeding time was
moderately prolonged. Platelet function test showed reduced secretion in
response to ATP. Electron microscopy of her platelets showed only very
rare dense granules. Her parents had no known consanguinity, but both
were from the same small region of east Flanders. A brother was
similarly affected.

Schreyer-Shafir et al. (2006) studied a large consanguineous Israeli
Bedouin family in which the Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome phenotype was
characterized mainly by oculocutaneous albinism. Electron microscopic
studies of platelets showed absence of dense bodies, consistent with
HPS, and confocal microscopy revealed abnormal distribution of LAMP3
(605883) in patient fibroblasts, indicating abnormal trafficking of
lysosomal-related organelles. The findings expanded the phenotype
associated with mutations in the HPS6 gene.

Huizing et al. (2009) described 4 patients with Hermansky-Pudlak
syndrome-6. The first was a 36-year-old woman of Irish and German
descent who was found to have partial albinism and nystagmus at age 5
months, but diagnosis was not made until age 26 when bleeding
complications were followed up, revealing an absence of platelet dense
bodies. She also had multiple abdominal surgeries for hernia,
imperforate anus, and gluteal flap repairs. She had other medical
problems, including 4 miscarriages, endometriosis, frequent upper
respiratory and urinary tract infections, incontinence, migraine
headaches, and hearing loss. However, she did not have granulomatous
colitis, and renal and pulmonary functions were normal. The second
patient was a 22-year-old man of northern European descent who had
nystagmus at birth and was diagnosed with oculocutaneous albinism at age
3 months. Although bruising and bleeding after trauma were noted in
childhood, he was not diagnosed with HPS until age 16 years, when
laboratory studies showed absence of platelet dense granules. There was
no renal or lung disease. The third was a 13-year-old girl of German and
Dutch descent who had rotary nystagmus in infancy and was diagnosed with
oculocutaneous albinism. She had global delayed development and easy
bruising. Platelet storage pool deficiency and absence of dense bodies
were noted at age 4 years. The fourth patient, a 52-year-old Italian
man, also had rotary nystagmus at birth and bruising in childhood. He
was diagnosed at age 44 years only when he was found to have
gastrointestinal symptoms and oculocutaneous albinism. Laboratory
studies showed iron-deficiency anemia and low vitamin B12. There was no
interstitial lung disease or renal involvement. Huizing et al. (2009)
concluded that patients with HPS6 appear to have clinical features
similar to those of other BLOC2-deficient patients, that is, patients
with HPS3 (614072) and HPS5 (614074).

MAPPING

Zhang et al. (2003) mapped the HPS6 gene to chromosome 10q24.32.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a 39-year-old Belgian woman with HPS, Zhang et al. (2003) identified
a homozygous 4-bp deletion (607522.0001) in the HPS6 gene.

Huizing et al. (2009) identified homozygous or compound heterozygous
mutations (607522.0003-607522.0007) in the HPS6 gene in 4 unrelated
patients with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome. All mutations except 1 resulted
in a truncated protein. The phenotype was characterized by early-onset
nystagmus, oculocutaneous albinism, and a mild bleeding diathesis, but
no pulmonary fibrosis, granulomatous colitis, or renal involvement.
However, 2 patients had gastrointestinal symptoms. In vitro cellular
studies performed on patient melanocytes indicated aberrant cytoplasmic
distribution patterns of melanogenic proteins and increased trafficking
of TYRP1 (115501) through the plasma membrane, indicating a defect in
lysosomal-related organelles.

603485	TITLE *603485 NITROGEN FIXATION GENE 1; NFS1
;;NITROGEN-FIXING BACTERIA S, HOMOLOG OF; NIFS;;
CYSTEINE DESULFURASE;;
ISCS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters are prosthetic groups found in respiratory
chain complexes and numerous mitochondrial and cytosolic enzymes.
Assembly of Fe-S clusters requires cysteine desulfurases, such as NFS1,
as well as scaffold proteins, iron donors, and chaperones (Li et al.,
2006).

CLONING

Using sequence homology to bacterial NifS, Land and Rouault (1998)
cloned the human homolog of NifS, a cysteine desulfurase that is
proposed to supply the inorganic sulfur in iron-sulfur clusters. In
human cells, different forms of NIFS that localize either to
mitochondria or to the cytosol and nucleus are synthesized from a single
transcript through initiation at alternative in-frame AUGs, and
initiation site selection varies according to the pH of the medium or
cytosol. Thus, this form of translational regulation permits rapid
redistribution of NIFS proteins into different compartments of the cell
in response to changes in metabolic status.

GENE FUNCTION

Li et al. (2006) overexpressed the cytosolic isoform of human ISCS in
yeast and showed that it was an active cysteine desulfurase that
converted cysteine to alanine and covalently bound sulfur in a
persulfide. Cytosolic ISCS homodimerized and formed a complex in vitro
with overexpressed human cytosolic ISCU (611911). When incubated with
iron regulatory protein-1 (IRP1, or ACO1; 100880), cysteine, and iron,
the cytosolic isoforms of ISCS and ISCU facilitated efficient formation
of a 4Fe-4S cluster on IRP1.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the NFS1
gene to chromosome 20pter-p12.3 (TMAP SGC32196).
