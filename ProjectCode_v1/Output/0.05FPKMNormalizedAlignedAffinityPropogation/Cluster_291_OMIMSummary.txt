300375	TITLE *300375 CARBOHYDRATE SULFOTRANSFERASE 7; CHST7
;;CHONDROITIN 6-SULFOTRANSFERASE 2; C6ST2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Sulfotransferases generate sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG) moities
during chondroitin sulfate biosynthesis. They create considerable
structural diversity among chondroitin sulfates by transferring sulfate
with remarkable specificity for the underlying oligosaccharide
substrate. The regulated expression of each member of the
sulfotransferase gene family may be an important determinant of sulfated
GAGs expression and the associated function of chondroitin sulfates as
regulators of many biologic processes.

CLONING

By searching an EST database for members of the sulfotransferase gene
family, followed by 5-prime race using brain cDNA, Kitagawa et al.
(2000) obtained a full-length cDNA encoding CHST7, which they called
C6ST2. Sequence analysis predicted that the 486-amino acid CHST7 protein
has 4 potential N-glycosylation sites and a type II transmembrane
topology characteristic of many Golgi-localized sulfotransferases. CHST7
shares 24% and 40% amino acid identity with C6ST1 (CHST3; 603799) and
CHST2 (603798), respectively. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.4-kb
CHST7 transcript in all brain tissues tested. RT-PCR analysis showed
CHST7 expression in most fetal and adult tissues tested; a notable
exception was adult skin. In fetal tissues, expression was most abundant
in heart, lung, skeletal muscle, and spleen, while in adult tissues,
expression was most abundant in spleen. The authors noted that the CHST7
expression pattern was distinct from that of CHST3.

GENE FUNCTION

Kitagawa et al. (2000) expressed a soluble recombinant form of CHST7 in
COS-1 cells and produced an active sulfotransferase with marked
specificity for polymer chondroitin. The authors found that CHST7 and
CHST3 have distinct but overlapping acceptor substrate specificities,
with CHST7 having a more strict specificity for polymer chondroitin.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Kitagawa et al. (2000) determined that the
CHST7 gene has 2 exons and spans more than 24 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Kitagawa et al. (2000) mapped the CHST7
gene to chromosome Xp11.

608073	TITLE *608073 NUCLEOPHOSMIN/NUCLEOPLASMIN FAMILY, MEMBER 2; NPM2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Burns et al. (2003) cloned mouse Npm2 and identified human NPM2. The
deduced human protein contains 214 amino acids and shares 61% identity
with mouse Npm2. NPM2 has a conserved bipartite nuclear localization
signal followed by a stretch of negatively charged glutamic acid and
aspartic acid residues implicated in protamine and histone binding. It
also has several putative serine and threonine phosphorylation sites.
Northern blot analysis of several mouse tissues detected a 1.0-kb
transcript only in ovary, and in situ hybridization revealed expression
limited to growing oocytes. Immunofluorescent localization detected Npm2
within the oocyte nucleus before nuclear membrane breakdown, after which
Npm2 redistributed to the cytoplasm. Following fertilization, Npm2
localized to pronuclei and nuclei of early cleavage embryos through the
8-cell stage. Npm2 was barely detectable in blastocysts.

GENE STRUCTURE

Burns et al. (2003) determined that the mouse Npm2 gene contains 9 exons
and spans about 5.8 kb.

MAPPING

Burns et al. (2003) mapped the mouse Npm2 gene to chromosome 14.

ANIMAL MODEL

Burns et al. (2003) found that female Npm2-null mice showed defects in
preimplantation embryo development, with abnormalities in oocyte and
early embryonic nuclei. Defects included the absence of coalesced
nucleolar structures and the loss of heterochromatin and deacetylated
histone H3 (see 602810), which normally circumscribe nucleoli in oocytes
and early embryos, respectively. In male mice, sperm DNA decondensation
proceeded in the absence of Npm2.

;;COFACTOR REQUIRED FOR SP1 TRANSCRIPTIONAL ACTIVATION, SUBUNIT 9; CRSP9;;
CRSP, 33-KD SUBUNIT; CRSP33
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The Mediator is a multiprotein coactivator that is required by
DNA-binding transcription factors for activation of polymerase II (see
180660)-transcribed genes. MED7 appears to be a core Mediator subunit
and is found in nearly all Mediator preparations (summary by Sato et
al., 2004).

CLONING

Gene transcription requires factors that recognize transcriptional
enhancer sites in DNA. These factors work with coactivators to direct
transcriptional initiation by the RNA polymerase II apparatus (see
POLR2A; 180660). Transcriptional activation by enhancer-binding factors
such as SP1 (189906) requires interaction with the TFIID complex (see
TAF2A, 313650). To identify other potential SP1 cofactors, Ryu et al.
(1999) developed an in vitro transcription assay consisting of TFIIA
(GTF2A1; 600520), RNA polII, and the basal transcription factors GTF2B
(189963), GTF2E (189962), GTF2F (189968), and GTF2H (189972),
supplemented with TFIID or TBP (600075). By sequential chromatography,
they excluded PC4 (600503) as an SP1 cofactor and identified a
multisubunit cofactor, CRSP (cofactor required for SP1 activation),
which, along with TFIID, is required for efficient activation by SP1.
CRSP behaves as a single complex of approximately 700 kD. Ryu et al.
(1999) tentatively identified 9 polypeptides as CRSP subunits (see also
PPARBP; 604311). Using microsequence peptide analysis, they cloned a
CRSP cDNA encoding a 33-kD protein, CRSP9, which they termed CRSP34.
CRSP9 is identical to a homolog of yeast Med7, which was identified by
Myers et al. (1998).

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the MED7
gene to chromosome 5 (TMAP NIB574).

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Paris and Williams (2000) identified several genes, including CDHR5,
which they called MUCDHL, by constructing a physical map of chromosome
11p15.5. They found that MUCDHL contains nonpolymorphic tandem repeats
similar to mucin proteins and a consensus calcium-binding motif found in
all cadherins.

MAPPING

Paris and Williams (2000) constructed a physical map of chromosome
11p15.5 and located the CDHR5 gene less than 250 kb telomeric to a mucin
gene cluster.

601613	TITLE *601613 CHEMOKINE, CXC MOTIF, RECEPTOR 5; CXCR5
;;BURKITT LYMPHOMA RECEPTOR 1; BLR1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Dobner et al. (1992) and Kaiser et al. (1993) identified a novel member
of the G protein-coupled receptor family termed BLR1 (BLR1 having been
identified from Burkitt lymphoma).

GENE FUNCTION

B lymphocytes recirculate between B cell-rich compartments (follicles or
B zones) in secondary lymphoid organs, surveying for antigen. After
antigen binding, B cells move to the boundary of B and T zones to
interact with T-helper cells. Reif et al. (2002) demonstrated that
antigen-engaged B cells have increased expression of CCR7 (600242), the
receptor for the T-zone chemokines CCL19 (602227) and CCL21 (602737),
and that they exhibit increased responsiveness to both chemoattractants.
In mice lacking lymphoid CCL19 and CCL21 chemokines, or with B cells
that lack CCR7, antigen engagement fails to cause movement to the T
zone. Using retroviral-mediated gene transfer, the authors demonstrated
that increased expression of CCR7 is sufficient to direct B cells to the
T zone. Reciprocally, overexpression of CXCR5, the receptor for the
B-zone chemokine CXCL13 (also known as BLC), is sufficient to overcome
antigen-induced B-cell movement to the T zone. Reif et al. (2002)
concluded that their findings defined the mechanism of B-cell
relocalization in response to antigen, and established that cell
position in vivo can be determined by the balance of responsiveness to
chemoattractants made in separate but adjacent zones.

Chan et al. (2003) investigated the expression of chemokines and
chemokine receptors in eyes with primary intraocular B-cell lymphoma
(PIOL). All 3 PIOL eyes showed similar pathology, with typical diffuse
large B-lymphoma cells between the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and
Bruch membrane. The eyes also showed a similar chemokine profile with
the expression of CXCR4 (162643) and CXCR5 in the lymphoma cells. CXCL13
(BLC) and CXCL12 (600835) transcripts were found only in the RPE and not
in the malignant cells. No chemokine expression was detected on the RPE
cells of a normal control eye. Since chemokines and chemokine receptors
selective for B cells were identified in RPE and malignant B cells in
eyes with PIOL, inhibition of B-cell chemoattractants might be a future
strategy for the treatment of PIOL.

The germinal center (GC) is organized into dark and light zones. B cells
in the dark zone, called centroblasts, undergo rapid proliferation and
somatic hypermutation of their antibody variable genes. Centroblasts
then become smaller, nondividing centrocytes and undergo selection in
the light zone based on the affinity of their surface antibody for the
inducing antigen. The light zone also contains helper T cells and
follicular dendritic cells that sequester antigen. Failure to
differentiate results in centrocyte apoptosis, whereas centrocytes that
bind antigen and receive T-cell help emigrate from the GC as long-lived
plasma cells or memory B cells. Some centrocytes may also return to the
dark zone for further proliferation and mutation. Using genetic and
pharmacologic approaches, Allen et al. (2004) showed that CXCR4 was
essential for GC dark and light zone segregation. In the presence of the
antiapoptotic BCL2 (151430), B cells had robust chemotactic responses to
the CXCR4 ligand, CXCL12, as well as to CXCL13, the ligand for CXCR5.
CXCL12 was more abundant in the dark zone, and CXCR4 was more abundant
on centroblasts than centrocytes. In contrast, CXCR5 helped direct cells
to the CXCL13-positive light zone, but was not essential for segregation
of the 2 zones. CXCL13 and CXCR5 were required for correct positioning
of the light zone. Allen et al. (2004) concluded that these chemokines
and their receptors are critical for movement of cells to different
parts of the GC and for creating the distinct histologic appearance of
the GC.

Using flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry, Cagigi et al. (2008)
found that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 (see
609423)-seropositive patients, particularly those with low CD4
(186940)-positive T-cell counts, had reduced expression of CXCR5 on B
cells, whereas expression of its ligand, CXCL13, was increased. CXCL13
was secreted upon B-cell activation. CXCL13-positive B cells were
present in lymph nodes of HIV-1-seropositive patients, but not in
control tissue. Cagigi et al. (2008) concluded that altered expression
of CXCR5 and CXCL13 may be involved in B-cell dysfunction during HIV-1
infection.

ANIMAL MODEL

Forster et al. (1996) described the phenotype of gene-targeted mice
lacking the putative chemokine receptor Blr1. In normal mice, this
receptor is expressed on mature B cells and a subpopulation of T helper
cells. Blr1-mutant mice lack inguinal lymph nodes and possess no or only
a few phenotypically abnormal Peyer patches. The migration of
lymphocytes into splenic follicles was severely impaired, resulting in
morphologically altered primary lymphoid follicles. Furthermore,
activated B cells failed to migrate from the T cell-rich zone into
B-cell follicles of the spleen, and despite high numbers of germinal
center founder cells, no functional germinal centers developed in this
organ. These results identified BLR1 as the first G protein-coupled
receptor involved in B cell migration and localization of these cells
within specific anatomic compartments.

CXCR5 was known to be required for B cell migration to splenic
follicles, but the requirements for homing to B-cell areas and lymph
nodes remained to be defined. Ansel et al. (2000) demonstrated that
lymph nodes contain 2 types of B cell-rich compartment: follicles
containing follicular dendritic cells, and areas lacking such cells.
Ansel et al. (2000) generated mice deficient in the B-lymphocyte
chemoattractant (BLC; 605149), for which CXCR5 is the receptor, by
targeted disruption. BLC-deficient mice were similar in appearance to
mice deficient in CXCR5. However, CXCR5-deficient mice have less severe
deficiency in Peyer patches. Using BLC-deficient mice, Ansel et al.
(2000) established that BLC and CXCR5 are needed for B-cell homing to
follicles in lymph nodes as well as in spleen. They also found that BLC
is required for the development of most lymph nodes and Peyer patches.
In addition to mediating chemoattraction, BLC induces B cells to
upregulate membrane lymphotoxin alpha-1-beta-2 (see 600978), a cytokine
that promotes follicular dendritic cell development and BLC expression,
establishing a positive feedback loop thought to be important in
follicle development and homeostasis. In germinal centers, the feedback
loop is overridden, with B cell lymphotoxin alpha-1-beta-2 expression
being induced by a mechanism independent of BLC.

Voigt et al. (2000) found that B cells and dendritic cells do
colocalize, albeit aberrantly, even in the absence of CXCR5. In mice
lacking Cxcr5, both cell types were found in a broad ring around the
sinuses of the marginal zones. Voigt et al. (2000) concluded that in
Cxcr5-deficient mice, the organization of splenic primary follicles is
severely impaired. However, within the T cell zone a microenvironment is
built up, which provides all requirements needed for the affinity
maturation to take place.

Prinz et al. (2003) found that in mice deficient in Cxcr5 the follicular
dendritic cells (FDCs) are juxtaposed to major splenic nerves and the
transfer of intraperitoneally-administered prions (see 176640) into the
spinal cord is accelerated. Neuroinvasion velocity correlated
exclusively with the relative locations of FDCs and nerves; transfer of
Cxcr5 -/- bone marrow to wildtype mice induced perineural FDCs and
enhanced neuroinvasion, whereas reciprocal transfer to Cxcr5 -/- mice
abolished them and restored normal efficiency of neuroinvasion.
Suppression of lymphotoxin signaling depleted FDCs, abolished splenic
infectivity, and suppressed acceleration of pathogenesis in Cxcr5 -/-
mice. Prinz et al. (2003) concluded that their data suggests that prion
neuroimmune transition occurs between FDCs and sympathetic nerves, and
relative positioning of FDCs and nerves controls the efficiency of
peripheral prion infection.

609134	TITLE *609134 UBIQUITIN-PROTEIN LIGASE E3 COMPONENT N-RECOGNIN 2; UBR2
;;CHROMOSOME 6 OPEN READING FRAME 133; C6ORF133;;
KIAA0349
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Proteolysis by the ubiquitin-proteasome system controls the
concentration of many regulatory proteins. The selectivity of
ubiquitylation is determined by ubiquitin E3 ligases, which recognize
the substrate's destabilization signal, or degron. The E3 ligase UBR2
participates in the N-end rule pathway, which targets proteins bearing
an N-terminal degron, or N-degron (Kwon et al., 2003).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1997) cloned UBR2, which they designated
KIAA0349. The deduced 1,275-amino acid protein shares 19.9% identity
over 710 amino acids with an S. cerevisiae N-end-recognizing protein.
RT-PCR of several tissues detected UBR2 expression only in testis.

Kwon et al. (2003) cloned mouse Ubr2. The deduced protein has a
calculated molecular mass of about 200 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Kwon et al. (2003) determined that mouse Ubr2 bound to type-1 (arg) and
type-2 (leu or phe) destabilizing N-terminal residues of a test
substrate or a 12-residue peptide. It did not bind to stabilizing (met
or gly), secondary destabilizing (asp), or type-3 destabilizing (ser,
thr, or ala) residues.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kwon et al. (2003) determined that the mouse Ubr2 gene contains 48 exons
and spans about 98 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1997) mapped the UBR2 gene
to chromosome 6. Using radiation hybrid analysis and FISH, Kwon et al.
(2003) mapped the UBR2 gene to chromosome 6p21-p11 and the mouse Ubr2
gene to the middle of chromosome 17.

ANIMAL MODEL

Kwon et al. (2003) found that Ubr2 knockout in mice was embryonic lethal
depending on both the gender and genetic background. In an inbred
strain, the Ubr2 -/- genotype was lethal to most embryos of either
gender. In a mixed background, most Ubr2 -/- females died as embryos and
Ubr2 -/- males were viable but infertile due to postnatal degeneration
of the testes. The gross architecture of Ubr2 -/- testes was normal and
spermatogonia were intact, but spermatocytes were arrested between
leptotene/zygotene and pachytene, and died through apoptosis. A
conspicuous defect of Ubr2 -/- spermatocytes was the absence of intact
synaptonemal complexes. Ubr2 +/- heterozygotes were produced at
approximately mendelian frequency and were phenotypically normal except
for reduced fertility compared with wildtype mice.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Caspases are cysteine proteases that play a central role in apoptosis.
Caspase-8 (FLICE; 601763) may be the first enzyme of the proteolytic
cascade that is activated by the FAS ligand (FASL; 134638) and tumor
necrosis factor (TNF; 191160). Caspase-8 is recruited to FAS (134637)
and TNF receptor-1 (TNFR1; 191190) through interaction of its prodomain
with the death effector domain (DED) of the receptor-associating protein
FADD (602457). By searching EST databases for sequences related to FADD,
Shu et al. (1997) identified cDNAs encoding a protein that they
designated CASPER. The predicted 480-amino acid CASPER protein contains
2 DED-like modules at its N terminus and a C-terminal caspase-like
protease domain. However, CASPER is not a caspase since it lacks several
conserved amino acids found in all identified caspases. Northern blot
analysis detected several CASPER transcripts, with highest expression in
human skeletal muscle, pancreas, and heart.

The viral FLICE inhibitory proteins (v-FLIPs) contain 2 DEDs and block
the early signaling events of the cellular death receptors. By searching
EST databases for cellular homologs of v-FLIPs, Irmler et al. (1997)
isolated human cDNAs encoding 2 isoforms of FLIP. FLIP(L), the longer
isoform, contains 2 DEDs and a caspase-like domain, and FLIP(S), the
shorter isoform, contains only the 2 DEDs followed by a C-terminal
extension of approximately 50 amino acids.

Goltsev et al. (1997), Han et al. (1997), Hu et al. (1997), Inohara et
al. (1997), and Srinivasula et al. (1997) isolated FLIP cDNAs; they
designated the gene CASH (caspase homolog), MRIT (MACH-related inducer
of toxicity; 'mrit' also means 'death' in Sanskrit), I-FLICE (inhibitor
of FLICE), CLARP (caspase-like apoptosis regulatory protein), and FLAME1
(FADD-like antiapoptotic molecule-1), respectively. Han et al. (1997)
cloned a cDNA encoding an MRIT isoform, which they called MRIT-alpha-2,
that lacks the first DED.

Irmler et al. (1997) and Goltsev et al. (1997) isolated cDNAs encoding
the mouse homolog of FLIP.

By microarray analysis, Jun et al. (2001) demonstrated expression of the
CFLAR gene in human donor corneas.

GENE FUNCTION

Shu et al. (1997) showed that CASPER interacted with FADD, caspase-8
(601763), caspase-3 (CASP3; 600636), TRAF1 (601711), and TRAF2 (601895)
through distinct domains. Overexpression of CASPER or its C-terminal
protease-like domain potently induced apoptosis, whereas a deletion
mutant lacking 45 C-terminal residues inhibited TNF- and FAS-induced
apoptosis. Since this truncated form is encoded by a natural splice
variant of CASPER, Shu et al. (1997) suggested that alternative splicing
of CASPER may provide a mechanism to regulate apoptosis triggered by
cell death pathways.

Irmler et al. (1997) found that activation of T cells induced a
transient resistance to FAS-induced apoptotic signals that correlated
with increased expression of FLIP(L). High levels of FLIP(L) protein
were detected in melanoma cell lines and malignant melanoma tumors. The
authors concluded that FLIP may be implicated in tissue homeostasis as
an important regulator of apoptosis.

Han et al. (1997) found that, when expressed in mammalian cells, MRIT
simultaneously and independently interacted with FLICE and BCLX(L)
(600039), an antiapoptotic member of the BCL2 family. Han et al. (1997)
suggested that MRIT may function as a link between cell survival and
cell death pathways in mammalian cells.

In human islets, elevated glucose concentrations impair beta-cell
proliferation and induce beta-cell apoptosis via upregulation of the FAS
receptor. Maedler et al. (2002) observed expression of FLIP in human
pancreatic beta-cells of nondiabetic individuals and decreased
expression in tissue sections of type 2 diabetic patients. In vitro
exposure of islets from nondiabetic organ donors to high glucose levels
decreased FLIP expression and increased the percentage of apoptotic
beta-cells, in which FLIP was no longer detectable. Upregulation of
FLIP, by incubation with transforming growth factor beta (TGFB1; 190180)
or by transfection with an expression vector coding for FLIP, protected
beta cells from glucose-induced apoptosis, restored beta-cell
proliferation, and improved beta-cell function. The beneficial effects
of FLIP overexpression were blocked by an antagonistic anti-FAS
antibody, indicating the dependence of these effects on FAS receptor
activation. The data provided evidence for expression of FLIP in the
human beta cell and suggested a novel approach to prevent and treat
diabetes by switching FAS signaling from apoptosis to proliferation.

The biologic outcome of TNF treatment is determined by the balance
between NF-kappa-B (see 164011), which promotes survival, and JNK (see
601158), which promotes cell death. Chang et al. (2006) found that Jnk
activity controlled Tnf-induced cell death through proteasomal
processing of Flip(L) in mice. Instead of direct phosphorylation of
Flip(L), Jnk promoted accelerated decay of Flip(L) through
phosphorylation and activation of the ubiquitin ligase Itch (606409).
Jnk1 or Itch deficiency or treatment with a Jnk inhibitor rendered mice
resistant in 3 distinct models of Tnf-induced liver failure, and cells
from these mice did not show inducible Flip(L) ubiquitination and
degradation. Chang et al. (2006) concluded that JNK antagonizes
NF-kappa-B during TNF signaling by promoting proteasomal elimination of
FLIP(L).

Oberst et al. (2011) showed that development of caspase-8-deficient mice
is completely rescued by ablation of receptor-interacting protein
kinase-3 (RIPK3; 605817). Adult animals lacking both caspase-8 and Ripk3
displayed a progressive lymphoaccumulative disease resembling that seen
with defects in Cd95 (FAS; 134637) or Cd95 ligand (FASL; 134638), and
resisted the lethal effects of Cd95 ligation in vivo. Oberst et al.
(2011) found that caspase-8 prevents RIPK3-dependent necrosis without
inducing apoptosis by functioning in a proteolytically active complex
with CFLAR and that this complex is required for the protective
function.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hadano et al. (2001) determined that the CFLAR gene contains 14 exons
and spans about 48 kb. It is transcribed in the centromere-to-telomere
direction.

MAPPING

Han et al. (1997) used fluorescence in situ hybridization and
Srinivasula et al. (1997) used radiation hybrid mapping to localize the
FLIP gene to 2q33-q34. Based on sequence similarity to STSs, Irmler et
al. (1997) and Inohara et al. (1997) tentatively mapped the FLIP gene to
2q33. Irmler et al. (1997) noted that the FLIP gene colocalizes with
caspase-10 (CASP10; 601762) on 2q33, suggesting that these genes arose
by gene duplication. Hadano et al. (2001) determined that the CFLAR,
CASP10, and CASP8 (601763) genes are tandemly located within 200 kb.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yeh et al. (2000) observed that mice deficient in Cflar failed to
survive beyond embryonic day 10.5 and exhibited impaired heart
development, similar to mice lacking Fadd or Casp8. Unlike mice lacking
Fadd or Casp8, however, Cflar -/- embryonic fibroblasts were highly
sensitive to FASL- or TNF-induced apoptosis, showing rapid induction of
Casp3 and Casp8 activities. Both nuclear factor kappa-B and Jnk/Sapk
were activated in Cflar-deficient and wildtype cells in response to TNF.
Yeh et al. (2000) proposed that CFLAR cooperates with CASP8 and FADD
during embryonic development and regulates death factor-induced
apoptosis induced by FAS or TNFR1 engagement.

Huang et al. (2010) generated mice with conditional loss of Flip
expression in myeloid cells. These mice exhibited growth retardation,
premature death, and splenomegaly with extramedullary hematopoiesis.
They also showed increased circulating neutrophils with multiorgan
neutrophil infiltration. Monocytes were also increased, but macrophages
were reduced. In vitro, differentiation to macrophages was Flip
dependent. Huang et al. (2010) concluded that FLIP is necessary for
macrophage differentiation and homeostatic regulation of granulopoiesis.

186760	TITLE *186760 ANTIGEN CD28; CD28
;;T-CELL ANTIGEN CD28;;
Tp44
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CD28 costimulation is essential for CD4 (186940)-positive T-cell
proliferation, survival, interleukin-2 (IL2; 147680) production, and
T-helper type-2 (Th2) development.

CLONING

Monoclonal antibodies recognize 3 antigens, CD3 (186790), CD2 (186990),
and CD28 (Tp44), that cause human T cells to proliferate in the presence
of phorbol esters. Whereas CD3 appeared to be involved in transduction
of the signal generated by antigen binding to the T-cell receptor, the
role of the CD2 and CD28 antigens in physiologic proliferation was not
understood. Aruffo and Seed (1987) isolated a cDNA clone encoding CD28
by a simple and highly efficient cloning strategy based on transient
expression. In COS cells the CD28 encodes a highly glycosylated membrane
protein with homology to the immunoglobulin superfamily.

Magistrelli et al. (1999) identified 3 CD28 splice variants in
nonactivated T cells: CD28a, which lacks exon 3, leading to loss of the
transmembrane domain; CD28b, which lacks most of the 3-prime end of exon
2 and exon 3; and CD28c, which lacks exon 2 and exon 3. CD28b and CD28c
were expressed at a low level relative to CD28a. Magistrelli et al.
(1999) suggested that resting T cells may constitutively express both
membrane and soluble CD28, potentially regulating the T-cell response at
different levels.

GENE FUNCTION

Harada et al. (2003) noted that the CD28 cytoplasmic domain contains a
YMNM motif, which binds PI3K (see 601232) and GRB2 (108355), whereas the
corresponding region of ICOS (604558) contains a YMFM motif, which binds
the former but not the latter. Harada et al. (2003) hypothesized that
the reason CD28 signaling, but not ICOS signaling, induces IL2
production is its ability to bind GRB2. To test this hypothesis, they
generated mutant ICOS containing the YMNM motif of CD28. This alteration
allowed ICOS to activate the IL2 promoter, and further analysis showed
that GRB2 binding to ICOS led to activation of the NFAT (see 600490)/AP1
(165160) site in the IL2 promoter. Harada et al. (2003) concluded that
the difference of a single amino acid defines a functional difference
between CD28- and ICOS-mediated costimulatory signals.

By a comprehensive structure-function analysis of the mouse Cd28
cytoplasmic tail, Andres et al. (2004) found that Il2 production and
T-cell proliferation did not require a particular cytoplasmic domain.
However, Il4 (147780) production was driven by cooperative activity of
at least 2 structural motifs, a pro-rich motif at residues 187 to 190
and tyr residues at positions 170 and 188, within the Cd28 cytoplasmic
tail. A gene complementation approach determined that Pdk1 (605213), but
not Itk (186973) or Akt (164730), in an Akt-independent pathway,
mediated a component of the Il4 signal induced by Cd28.

CTLA4 shares 2 ligands, CD80 (112203) and CD86 (601020), with a
stimulatory receptor, CD28. Qureshi et al. (2011) showed that CTLA4 can
capture its ligands from opposing cells by a process of
trans-endocytosis. After removal, these costimulatory ligands are
degraded inside CTLA4-expressing cells, resulting in impaired
costimulation via CD28. Acquisition of CD86 from antigen-presenting
cells is stimulated by T cell receptor engagement and observed in vitro
and in vivo. Qureshi et al. (2011) concluded that their data revealed a
mechanism of immune regulation in which CTLA4 acts as an effector
molecule to inhibit CD28 costimulation by the cell-extrinsic depletion
of ligands, accounting for many of the features of the CD28-CTLA4
system.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lee et al. (1990) found that the CD28 gene is present in single copy and
is organized into 4 exons, each of which defines a functional domain of
the predicted protein. Posttranslational processing appears to result in
variant isotypes of CD28 with potentially different physiologic roles on
the cell surface.

MAPPING

Using in situ hybridization on prometaphase cells, Lafage-Pochitaloff et
al. (1990) demonstrated that the CD28 gene maps to 2q33-q34. The CTLA4
gene (123890) maps to the same region. Both are members of the Ig
superfamily, where they define a subgroup of membrane-bound single V
domains. The chromosomal proximity of CD28 and CTLA4 and their close
structural relationship suggest that these 2 genes resulted from
duplication of a common evolutionary precursor and that they share some
functional properties. By means of intersubspecific crosses, Howard et
al. (1991) mapped the Cd28 gene to the proximal part of mouse chromosome
1. By study of yeast artificial chromosomes (YAC), Buonavista et al.
(1992) demonstrated that the CD28 and CTLA4 genes were in the same
fragment, indicating that they were separated by only 25 to 150 kb. A
CpG island was found between these genes.

ANIMAL MODEL

CD28 undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation after interacting with its
ligand, B7 (CD80; 112203). Phosphorylation of tyr173 (tyr170 in mouse)
in the cytoplasmic domain of CD28 allows the recruitment of signaling
proteins such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (see PIK3R1; 171833),
GRB2 (108355), and GADS (GRAP2; 604518) via their SH2 domains. Okkenhaug
et al. (2001) reconstituted CD28 knockout mice with transgenes encoding
wildtype Cd28 or Cd28 carrying a tyr170-to-phe mutation. Mutant Cd28 did
not bind to the SH2 domain of PIK3R1, resulting in diminished protein
kinase B (164730) activation. Mutant Cd28 was able to prevent the
induction of anergy, to promote T-cell proliferation and IL2 secretion,
and to provide B-cell help, but was unable to upregulate expression of
the prosurvival protein BCLXL (600039). The defect in BCLXL upregulation
was correlated with increased susceptibility of the T cells to gamma
radiation. Okkenhaug et al. (2001) suggested that other tyrosine
residues or asn172 may be critical to functions not affected by the
tyr170-to-phe mutation.

;;POLYPYRIMIDINE TRACT-BINDING PROTEIN-ASSOCIATED SPLICING FACTOR; PSF;;
PTB-ASSOCIATED SPLICING FACTOR
SFPQ/TFE3 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The RNA-binding protein PSF is a pre-mRNA splicing factor that also acts
as a transcriptional corepressor, and is a constituent of the PERIOD
(PER) complex involved in the generation of circadian rhythms (summary
by Duong et al., 2011).

CLONING

Patton et al. (1993) identified a 100-kD protein that copurified and
associated with polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB; 600693). By
microsequence analysis and PCR, followed by screening a fetal brain cDNA
library, Patton et al. (1993) isolated cDNAs encoding alternatively
spliced isoforms of this protein, which they called PSF (PTB-associated
splicing factor). The deduced 669- and 707-amino acid PSF isoforms
contain 2 consensus RNA-binding domains and an unusual N terminus rich
in proline and glutamine residues. PSF is highly basic and has a
predicted molecular mass of 76 kD, which is much lower than the
experimentally determined molecular mass of 100 kD. Northern blot
analysis detected PSF transcripts of 2.5 and 3.0 kb, consistent with the
alternative splicing. The authors found that the RNA-binding properties
of PSF are identical to those of PTB and that both proteins, together
and independently, bind the polypyrimidine tract of mammalian introns.
Biochemical complementation, antibody inhibition, and immunodepletion
experiments demonstrated that PSF is an essential pre-mRNA splicing
factor required early in spliceosome formation. Bacterially synthesized
PSF was able to complement immunodepleted extracts and restore splicing
activity. Despite its association with PSF, complementary experiments
with antibodies against PTB did not suggest an essential role for PTB in
pre-mRNA splicing.

CYTOGENETICS

Clark et al. (1997) identified cases of papillary renal cell carcinoma
(RCCX1; 300854) in which the splicing factor gene PSF was partnered with
the TFE3 gene as a result of a translocation, t(X;1)(p11.2;p34).

GENE FUNCTION

Duong et al. (2011) analyzed protein constituents of PERIOD (PER)
complexes purified from mouse tissues and identified PSF. Within the
complex, PSF functions to recruit SIN3A (607776), a scaffold for
assembly transcriptional inhibitory complexes; the PER complex thereby
rhythmically delivers histone deacetylases to the PER1 (602260)
promoter, which repress PER1 transcription. Duong et al. (2011)
concluded that their findings provided a function for the PER complex
and a molecular mechanism for circadian clock negative feedback.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Cantor et al. (2001) showed that BRCA1 (113705) interacts in vivo with a
novel protein, BRIP1, which they called BACH1 (BRCA1-associated
C-terminal helicase-1), a member of the DEAH helicase family. The
predicted 1,249-amino acid BRIP1 protein contains the 7
helicase-specific motifs that are conserved among members of the DEAH
family, and the helicase domain includes a nuclear localization signal.
Northern blot analysis revealed ubiquitous expression of BRIP1, with
highest levels in testis, an expression pattern similar to that of
BRCA1.

GENE FUNCTION

Cantor et al. (2001) demonstrated that BRIP1 binds directly to the BRCT
repeats of BRCA1. A BRIP1 derivative, bearing a mutation in a residue
that is essential for catalytic function in other helicases, interfered
with normal double-strand break repair in a manner that was dependent on
its BRCA1-binding function. Thus, the authors concluded that BRIP1-BRCA1
complex formation contributes to a key BRCA1 activity.

Genes that contribute to tumorigenesis can be broadly classified as
either gatekeepers or caretakers (Kinzler and Vogelstein, 1997). Genes
in the gatekeeper class directly regulate cell division or cell death,
and their alteration results in the uncontrolled cellular proliferation
that characterizes tumor cells. Genes in the caretaker class are
involved in DNA metabolic processes and are responsible for maintaining
the overall stability of the genome. The inherent stability of DNA
sequences varies widely, with some types of sequences being classified
as 'at risk motifs' (ARMs) that are particularly prone to accumulating
mutations or promoting genome rearrangements. One structural feature of
intact genomes is runs of homopolymeric dC/dG. Cheung et al. (2002)
described an unusual mutator phenotype in Caenorhabditis elegans
characterized by deletions that start around the 3-prime end of
polyguanine tracts and terminate at variable positions 5-prime from such
tracts. They observed deletions throughout genomic DNA in about half of
polyguanine tracts examined, especially those containing 22 or more
consecutive guanine nucleotides. The mutator phenotype resulted from
disruption of a gene that encodes a protein with characteristics of a
DEAH helicase, which Cheung et al. (2002) named dog1 (deletions of
guanine-rich DNA). Nematodes mutated in dog1 showed germline as well as
somatic deletions in genes containing polyguanine tracts. They proposed
that dog1 is required to resolve the secondary structures of
guanine-rich DNA that occasionally form during lagging-strand DNA
synthesis. Jinks-Robertson (2002), who referred to dog1 as 'the genome's
best friend,' pointed to BACH1 as the structurally most closely related
protein in humans and raised the possibility that targeted mutations in
BACH1 might show the mutational signature seen in dog1 mutant nematodes.

Yu et al. (2003) demonstrated that the BRCT domain of BRCA1 directly
interacts with phosphorylated BACH1. The specific interaction between
BRCA1 and phosphorylated BACH1 is cell cycle regulated and is required
for DNA damage-induced checkpoint control during the transition from G2
to M phase of the cell cycle. Further, Yu et al. (2003) showed that 2
other BRCT domains interact with their respective physiologic partners
in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Thirteen additional BRCT domains
also preferentially bind phosphopeptides rather than nonphosphorylated
control peptides. Yu et al. (2003) concluded that their data implied
that the BRCT domain is a phosphoprotein-binding domain involved in cell
cycle control.

Cantor et al. (2004) determined that BRIP1 is both a DNA-dependent
ATPase and a 5-prime-to-3-prime DNA helicase. Helicase activity was
strictly ATP dependent and was inhibited by the addition of EDTA,
consistent with a requirement for cations. BRIP1 unwound DNA:DNA
substrates and RNA:DNA hybrid substrates, but it did not unwind
double-stranded RNA. BRIP1 carrying a lys52-to-arg mutation lacked
ATPase activity, failed to be stimulated by single-stranded DNA, and was
inactive in an unwinding assay. BRIP1 with the clinically relevant
mutation pro47 to ala (P47A; 605882.0001) showed no detectable ATPase
activity and complete loss of function, whereas BRIP1 with the
clinically relevant mutation met299 to ile (M299I; 605882.0002) showed
elevated ATPase activity, but had limited ability to unwind DNA
substrates of more than 19 basepairs.

Bridge et al. (2005) cloned the chicken ortholog of BRIP1 and
established a homologous knockout in the avian B-cell line DT40. The
phenotype of these brip1 mutant cells in response to DNA damage differed
from that of brca1 mutant cells and more closely resembled that of fancc
(613899) mutant cells, with a profound sensitivity to the
DNA-crosslinking agent cisplatin and acute cell-cycle arrest in late
S-G2 phase. These defects were corrected by expression of human BRIP1
lacking the BRCT interaction domain. Moreover, in human cells exposed to
mitomycin C, short interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of BRIP1 led to a
substantial increase in chromosome aberrations, a characteristic
phenotype of cells derived from individuals with Fanconi anemia (see
FANCJ; 609054). Because brip1 mutant cells are proficient for the
ubiquitination of FANCD2 protein (613984), these data indicated that
brip1 has a function in the Fanconi anemia pathway that is independent
of BRCA1 and downstream of FANCD2 activation.

Gupta et al. (2007) found that FANCJ immunoprecipitated with RPA (see
RPA70, or RPA1; 179835), a multiprotein single-stranded DNA-binding
complex implicated in DNA replication and repair. FANCJ and RPA
colocalized in nuclear foci after DNA damage or replication stress.
FANCJ and RPA bound with high affinity via the RPA70 subunit. Although
FANCJ showed limited ability to unwind even a 47-bp forked duplex, the
presence of RPA enabled FANCJ to act as a much more processive helicase.

MAPPING

By genomic analysis, Cantor et al. (2001) mapped the BRIP1 gene to
chromosome 17q22.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Susceptibility to Breast Cancer

Cantor et al. (2001) identified germline BRIP1 mutations affecting the
helicase domain in 2 of 65 patients with early-onset breast cancer
(114480), of whom 35 had a strong family history of breast and/or
ovarian cancer but lacked mutations in either the BRCA1 or BRCA2
(600185) genes. The mutations were not found in 200 matched controls.
The authors concluded that like BRCA1, BRIP1 may be a target of germline
cancer-inducing mutations.

Seal et al. (2006) identified constitutional truncating mutations of the
BRCA1-interacting helicase BRIP1 in 9 of 1,212 individuals with breast
cancer from BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation-negative families but in only 2 of
2,081 controls (p = 0.0030). They estimated that BRIP1 mutations confer
a relative risk of breast cancer of 2.0 (95% confidence interval =
1.2-3.2). Thus, as in the case of BRCA2, inactivating truncating
mutations of BRIP1 cause Fanconi anemia in biallelic carriers and confer
susceptibility to breast cancer in monoallelic carriers. Of note,
biallelic mutations of the breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA2 cause
Fanconi anemia complementation group D1 (605724) (Litman et al., 2005).

- Fanconi Anemia, Complementation Group J

Using genetic mapping, mutation identification, and Western blot data,
Levran et al. (2005) identified the defective protein in FA-J cells
(FANCJ; 609054) as BRIP1. Genome scans identified a statistically
significant region of homozygosity of 6 Mb on 17q23. In this region, 2
affected Inuit sibs shared the same haplotype for 48 SNPs; the haplotype
of another Inuit individual differed by only 1 SNP, leaving a 4.5-Mb
region of shared haplotype among the Inuit individuals. Each of 2
Hispanic individuals had a unique haplotype; the extent of the
homozygous region was different in each individual.

After numerous unsuccessful attempts to identify the gene mutated in
FA-J (FANCJ), using a complementation cloning strategy, Levitus et al.
(2005) attempted positional cloning. By means of a genomewide scan using
closely positioned polymorphic markers, they identified the largest
region of homozygosity on chromosome 17 and studied this region in more
detail in informative families with FA-J. They also tested chromosome 17
for complementation of the Fanconi anemia defect by microcell-mediated
chromosome transfer. Boundaries of the chromosome 17 fragment and
information from the genomewide screen in genetically informative
families narrowed the FANCJ candidate region. They found that BRIP1
resided in the critical linkage region and considered it a good
candidate because chicken DT40 cells lacking BRIP1 expression have a
Fanconi anemia-like phenotype. They sequenced this gene in families with
FA-J and identified mutation in all affected individuals that segregated
with disease status in informative families. They found a recurrent
nonsense mutation, R798X in exon 17 (605882.0003), in 5 alleles from 4
individuals of diverse geographic origin, suggesting that it might be a
hotspot or an ancient mutation. All other mutations were private.

- Susceptibility to Ovarian Cancer

For discussion of a possible association between susceptibility to
ovarian cancer and variation in the BRIP1 gene, see 167000.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
BREAST CANCER, EARLY-ONSET
BRIP1, PRO47ALA

Cantor et al. (2001) identified a heterozygous C-to-G transversion at
nucleotide 139 of the BRIP1 gene, resulting in a pro47-to-ala mutation,
in an individual with early-onset breast cancer (114480) and a family
history of breast and ovarian cancer. This mutation occurred in the
helicase domain of the BRIP1 protein and was not found in 200 controls.

.0002
BREAST CANCER, EARLY-ONSET
BRIP1, MET299ILE

Cantor et al. (2001) identified a heterozygous G-to-A transition at
nucleotide 897 of the BRIP1 gene, resulting in a met299-to-ile mutation,
in an individual with early-onset breast cancer (114480) and a family
history of breast and ovarian cancer. This mutation occurred in the
helicase domain of the BRIP1 protein and was not found in 200 controls.

.0003
FANCONI ANEMIA, COMPLEMENTATION GROUP J
BRIP1, ARG798TER

In 10 unrelated individuals with Fanconi anemia complementation group J
(609054), Levran et al. (2005) found either homozygosity or compound
heterozygosity for the nonsense mutation arg798 to ter (R798X) in the
BRIP1 gene. Three of the 10 individuals were compound heterozygotes. The
diverse ethnicity included Hispanic, European American, Irish Traveler,
and Inuit. Phenotypic and hematologic abnormalities in these 10 affected
families included growth retardation, cafe-au-lait spots,
microphthalmia, thumb and kidney abnormalities, hearing loss, and bone
marrow failure beginning between 2 and 6.5 years.

Levitus et al. (2005) found the R798X mutation in 5 alleles from 4
individuals with Fanconi anemia complementation group J of diverse
geographic origin: Canada, United Kingdom, Kuwait, and the United
States.

.0004
FANCONI ANEMIA, COMPLEMENTATION GROUP J
BRIP1, ALA349PRO

In a stillborn fetus with a gestational age of 22 weeks and Fanconi
anemia complementation group J (609054), Levran et al. (2005) identified
compound heterozygosity for mutations in the BRIP1 gene. The maternally
inherited mutation was arg798 to ter (R798X; 605882.0003). The
paternally inherited mutation was a G-to-C transversion at nucleotide
1186 in exon 8 of the BRIP1 gene, resulting in an ala349-to-pro (A349P)
substitution. The fetus exhibited intrauterine growth retardation,
radial and ulna aplasia, bilateral clubfeet, cleft palate, abnormal
facies, and severe gastrointestinal, urogenital, cardiovascular,
respiratory, and central nervous system abnormalities.

Wu et al. (2010) stated that BRIP1 ala349 resides immediately adjacent
to a highly conserved cysteine of the predicted iron-sulfur (Fe-S)
domain. They found that the recombinant wildtype BRIP1 protein possessed
3 Fe atoms per polypeptide, whereas BRIP1 A349P had only 1 Fe atom per
polypeptide. BRIP1 A349P did not differ from wildtype recombinant BRIP1
in binding to various DNA substrates, ATPase activity, or ability to
translocate along single-stranded DNA in an ATPase-dependent manner.
However, unlike wildtype BRIP1, BRIP1 A349P lacked the ability to unwind
forked duplex DNA, 3-stranded D-loop DNA, or G4 DNA, was not activated
by RPA (see 179835), and was unable to displace RAD51 (179617) from
single-stranded DNA. BRIP1 A349P failed to render cells resistant to the
effects of the DNA crosslinking agent mitomycin C or the G4 DNA-binding
agent telomestatin. Wu et al. (2010) concluded that BRIP1 A349P exerts a
dominant-negative effect on cell survival or DNA damage accumulation
after treatment with agents that induce DNA damage or cellular stress.
They hypothesized that the mutation may disrupt the accumulation or
activity of other DNA repair/checkpoint factors at stalled replication
forks.

DILUTE, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Engle and Kennett (1994) cloned the human homolog of the mouse 'dilute'
gene, MYO5A. They suggested Griscelli syndrome (see 214450) and
neuroectodermal melanolysosomal disease (256710) as candidates for
mutations in the myoxin gene.

GENE FUNCTION

Several findings indicate that class V myosins perform multiple
functions within the cell. Espreafico et al. (1998) used a green
fluorescent protein (GFP) tag to characterize myosin V localization in
cultured mammalian cells and in primary cultures of rat hippocampus. In
all cells investigated, myosin V immunoreactivity was associated with
the centrosome. In interphase cells, myosin V was found in
pericentriolar material, and in both mother and daughter centrioles.
During cell division, myosin V staining was intense throughout the
cytoplasm and was concentrated in a trail between migrating centrioles
and in the mitotic spindle poles and spindle fibers. The consistent
association of myosin V with the centrosome was observed at all stages
of the cell cycle by all methods used. Espreafico et al. (1998) noted
that melanocytes isolated from 'dilute lethal' mice divide at half the
rate of melanocytes isolated from wildtype mice. They suggested that
myosin V function in the centrosome of human lymphocytes may be
essential either for cellular proliferation or for the polarized
movement of the centrosome that occurs during T-killer or T-helper cell
response.

Mehta et al. (1999) demonstrated that myosin V is a processive motor.
Processivity means that the motor undergoes multiple catalytic cycles
and coupled mechanical advances for each diffusional encounter with its
track. This allows single motors to support movement of an organelle
along its track. Mehta et al. (1999) provided direct evidence that
myosin V is a processive actin-based motor that can move in large steps
approximating the 36-nm pseudo-repeat of the actin filament. Rief et al.
(2000) provided a molecular model for myosin V processivity. The
findings of Rief et al. (2000) were discussed by Yanagida and Iwane
(2000).

Myosin V has heads of about 31 nm that could span the 36-nm actin
helical repeat and thus allow single 2-headed molecules to transport
cargo by walking straight. Walker et al. (2000) used electron microscopy
to show that while working, myosin V spans the helical repeat. The heads
are mostly 13 actin subunits apart, with values of 11 or 15 also found.
Typically the structure is polar and one head is curved, the other
straighter. Single particle processing reveals the polarity of the
underlying actin filament, showing that the curved head is the leading
one. The shape of the leading head may correspond to the beginning of
the working stroke of the motor. Walker et al. (2000) also observed
molecules attached by one head in this conformation. To test Walker's
hypothesis, Tanaka et al. (2002) measured the mechanical properties of
single molecules of myosin V truncation mutants with neck domains only
one-sixth of the native length. Tanaka et al. (2002) demonstrated that
the processivity and step distance along actin are both similar to those
of full-length myosin V. Thus, Tanaka et al. (2002) concluded that the
long neck domain is not essential for either the large steps or
processivity of myosin V. Their results challenged the lever-arm model.

El-Husseini and Vincent (1999) determined that an endogenous
brain-expressed ring finger (RNF22; 605493) interacts with class V
myosins. The authors hypothesized that interactions between RNF22 and
class V myosins may be important in organelle transport and neurite
outgrowth.

Fukuda et al. (2002) characterized the interaction between mouse MyoVa
and Rab27a (603868) in their studies of pigment granule transport. By
deletion analysis and site-directed mutagenesis, they determined that
melanophilin (606526) interacts with both proteins. The tripartite
protein complex could be immunoprecipitated from mouse melanocytes.

Organelle transport by myosin V is downregulated during mitosis,
presumably by myosin V phosphorylation. Karcher et al. (2001) used mass
spectrometry phosphopeptide mapping to show that the tail of myosin V
was phosphorylated in mitotic Xenopus egg extract on a single serine
residue localized in the carboxyl-terminal organelle-binding domain.
Phosphorylation resulted in the release of the motor from the organelle.
The phosphorylation site matched the consensus sequence of
calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMK2; see 114078), and
inhibitors of CAMK2 prevented myosin V release.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Forkey et al. (2003) reported 3-dimensional measurements of the
structural dynamics of the light chain domain of brain myosin V using a
single-molecule fluorescence polarization technique that determines the
orientation of individual protein domains with 20- to 40-ms time
resolution. Single fluorescent calmodulin (see 114180) light chains
tilted back and forth between 2 well-defined angles as the myosin
molecule processively translocated along actin. These results provided
evidence for lever arm rotation of the calmodulin-binding domain in
myosin V, and supported a hand-over-hand mechanism for the translocation
of double-headed myosin V molecules along actin filaments.

Myosin V is a dimeric molecular motor that moves processively on actin,
with the center of mass moving about 37 nanometers for each ATP
hydrolyzed. Yildiz et al. (2003) labeled myosin V with a single
fluorophore at different positions in the light chain domain and
measured the step size with a standard deviation of less than 1.5
nanometers, with 0.5-second temporal resolution, and observation times
of minutes. The step size alternates between 37 + 2x nanometers and 37 -
2x, where x is the distance along the direction of motion between the
dye and the midpoint between the 2 heads. Yildiz et al. (2003) concluded
that these results strongly support a hand-over-hand model of motility,
not an inchworm model.

Liu et al. (2006) showed the first 3-dimensional structure of the myosin
V inactive state. Each myosin V molecule consists of 2 heads that
contain an N-terminal motor domain followed by a lever arm that binds 6
calmodulins. The heads are followed by a coiled-coil dimerization domain
(S2) and a C-terminal globular cargo-binding domain. In the inactive
structure, bending of myosin V at the head-S2 junction places the
cargo-binding domain near the motor domain's ATP-binding pocket,
indicating that ATPase inhibition might occur through decreased rates of
nucleotide exchange. The actin-binding interfaces are unobstructed, and
the lever arm is oriented in a position typical of strong actin-binding
states. Liu et al. (2006) concluded that this structure indicates that
motor recycling after cargo delivery might occur through transport on
actively treadmilling actin filaments rather than by diffusion.

Thirumurugan et al. (2006) described the structure of folded myosin and
the role of the globular tail domains in regulating activity. Electron
microscopy showed that the 2 heads lie on either side of the tail,
contacting the globular tail domains at a lobe of the motor domain
(approximately pro117 to pro137) that contains conserved acidic side
chains, suggesting ionic interactions between motor domain and globular
tail domains. Myosin V heavy meromyosin, a constitutively active
fragment lacking the globular tail domains, was inhibited and folded by
a dimeric GST-globular tail domain fusion protein. Motility assays
revealed that at nanomolar calcium levels heavy meromyosin moves
robustly on actin filaments whereas few myosins bind or move.
Thirumurugan et al. (2006) concluded that with no cargo, the globular
tail domains bind in an intramolecular manner to the motor domains,
producing an inhibited and compact structure that binds weakly to actin
and allows the molecule to recycle towards new cargoes.

To observed under a microscope how the necks of myosin V move,
Shiroguchi and Kinosita (2007) attached a micrometer-sized rod to one of
the necks. The leading neck swings unidirectionally forward, whereas the
trailing neck, once lifted, undergoes extensive Brownian rotation in all
directions before landing on a site ahead of the leading neck. The
neck-neck joint is essentially free, and the neck motion supports a
mechanism where the active swing of the leading neck biases the random
motion of the lifted head to let it eventually land on a forward site.

MAPPING

Engle and Kennett (1994) assigned the MYO5A gene to human chromosome 15
by Southern blot analysis of a panel of human/rodent somatic cell
hybrids. The 'dilute' gene maps to mouse chromosome 9, distal to a group
of 3 loci of which the human homologs are located in the region
15q22-q26.

By somatic cell hybrid analysis and in situ hybridization, Moore et al.
(1995) mapped the MYH12 gene to 15q21, thus extending distally the
region of chromosome 15 with syntenic homology to mouse chromosome 9.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Griscelli syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized
by pigmentary dilution and either central nervous system (Griscelli
syndrome type 1, or GS1; 214450) or immunologic (GS2; 607624) defects.
Pastural et al. (1997) mapped a locus for Griscelli syndrome to 15q21 by
linkage to polymorphic markers in 3 consanguineous families and in 1
nonconsanguineous family. Pastural et al. (1997, 2000) demonstrated
mutations in the MYO5A gene in patients with GS1 (160777.0002,
160777.0003).

Anikster et al. (2002), Menasche et al. (2002), Huizing et al. (2002),
and Bahadoran et al. (2003, 2003) suggested that Elejalde syndrome
(256710) in some patients and GS1 represent the same entity.

In a patient with hypopigmentation without any immunologic or neurologic
manifestations (Griscelli syndrome type 3, 609227), Menasche et al.
(2003) identified a homozygous deletion of the F-exon of the MYO5A gene
(160777.0004).

ANIMAL MODEL

In the mouse, hundreds of 'dilute' mutations have been identified and
analyzed, making the 'dilute' locus one of the best characterized
genetically of all mammalian loci. The recessive 'dilute' (d) coat color
mutation carried by many inbred strains of mice produces a lightening of
coat color, caused by an abnormal adendritic melanocyte morphology that
results in an uneven release of pigment granules into the developing
hair shaft (Russell, 1949; Markert and Silvers, 1956). Most 'dilute'
alleles also produce a neurologic defect characterized by convulsions
and opisthotonos, apparent at 8 to 10 days of age, and continuing until
the death of the animal at 2 to 3 weeks of age. Jenkins et al. (1981)
discovered that the original 'dilute' allele was the result of the
integration of an ecotropic murine leukemia provirus. Copeland et al.
(1983) and Strobel et al. (1990) cloned genomic DNA of the 'dilute'
locus and Mercer et al. (1991) studied cDNA from the 'dilute' locus. The
predicted amino acid sequence of the gene product indicated that
'dilute' encodes a novel type of myosin heavy chain, with a C-terminal
region that has elements of both type II (alpha-helical coiled-coil) and
type I (non-coiled-coil) myosin heavy chains. 'Dilute' transcripts were
differentially expressed in both embryonic and adult tissues and were
abundant in neurons of the central nervous system, cephalic ganglia, and
spinal ganglia. The results suggested an important role for the gene
product called myoxin in the elaboration, maintenance, or function of
cellular processes of melanocytes and neurons.

The 'flailer' (flr) mouse exhibits a phenotype consisting of frequent
falling, convulsive limb movements (leg flailing), and ataxia persistent
into adulthood. The phenotype is similar to that of homozygotes for null
alleles of Myo5a. Jones et al. (2000) determined that the flailer mouse
expresses a novel gene combining the promoter and first 2 exons of
guanine nucleotide-binding protein beta-5 (GNB5; 604447) with the
C-terminal exons of the closely linked myosin-5A (MyoVA) gene (Myo5a).
Biochemical and genetic studies indicated that the flailer protein,
which is expressed predominantly in brain, competes with wildtype MyoVA
in vivo, preventing the localization of smooth endoplasmic reticulum
vesicles in the dendritic spines of cerebellar Purkinje cells. The
flailer protein thus has a dominant-negative mechanism of action with a
recessive mode of inheritance due to the dependence of competitive
binding on the ratio between mutant and wildtype proteins. The
chromosomal arrangement of Myo5a upstream of Gnb5 is consistent with
nonhomologous recombination as the mutational mechanism.

GRISCELLI SYNDROME, TYPE 1
MYO5A, 2332C-T

Pastural et al. (1997) found a homozygous C-to-T transition at
nucleotide 2332, resulting in premature termination and presumptive
truncation of the polypeptide at codon 779, in a girl with presumed
Griscelli syndrome (214450). The patient did not suffer from recurrent
infections, although she displayed the characteristic pigmentary
dilution. In addition, she had had marked motor developmental delay with
hypotonia and mental retardation since the age of 3 months. The family
was from Turkey and the parents were consanguineous. The truncated
protein was predicted to lack the last 1,078 amino acids.

Anikster et al. (2002) suggested that the patients of Pastural et al.
(1997) and other patients with primary central nervous system
complications and MYO5A mutations have not Griscelli syndrome but the
related disorder neuroectodermal melanolysosomal disease (256710). They
offered several lines of evidence to support their thesis.

.0003
GRISCELLI SYNDROME, TYPE 1
MYO5A, 47-BP INS, NT4634

In a patient with Griscelli syndrome type 1 (214450), Pastural et al.
(2000) found a 47-bp insertion in the MYO5A gene beginning at position
4634, corresponding to residue 1545, that predicted a truncated protein
lacking most of the globular domain.

.0004
GRISCELLI SYNDROME, TYPE 3
MYO5A, F-EXON DEL

In a patient with Griscelli syndrome type 3 (609227), first reported by
Sanal et al. (2002), Menasche et al. (2003) identified a homozygous
2,439-bp deletion spanning the entire F-exon of the MYO5A gene,
including part of the flanking 5-prime and 3-prime intronic sequences.
Microscopic analysis of the patient's hair shafts revealed large clumps
of pigment, a characteristic feature of Griscelli syndrome, but the
patient had no immunologic or neurologic symptoms at 8 years of
follow-up.

608208	TITLE *608208 MEMBRANE-ASSOCIATED RING-CH FINGER PROTEIN 4; MARCH4
;;MARCH IV;;
KIAA1399
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MARCH4 is a member of the MARCH family of membrane-bound E3 ubiquitin
ligases (EC 6.3.2.19). MARCH enzymes add ubiquitin (see 191339) to
target lysines in substrate proteins, thereby signaling their vesicular
transport between membrane compartments. MARCH4 reduces surface
accumulation of several membrane glycoproteins by directing them to the
endosomal compartment (Bartee et al., 2004).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned KIAA1399. The deduced protein
contains 452 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA detected high expression in whole
adult brain and moderate expression in fetal brain, fetal liver, spinal
cord, and all individual adult brain regions examined.

Poxviruses and gamma-2 herpesviruses express ubiquitin ligases called K3
proteins that inhibit the surface expression of glycoproteins, including
major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules (see 142800).
By searching a database for sequences similar to the functional domains
of viral K3 proteins, Bartee et al. (2004) identified 9 human MARCH
proteins, including MARCH4. The deduced MARCH4 protein contains a short
N terminus, followed by a RING-CH domain and 2 transmembrane domains.
MARCH4 shares 90% identity with MARCH9 (613336) in the RING-CH and
transmembrane domains. Real-time PCR high expression in brain and
placenta, weak expression in lung and pancreas, and little to no
expression in other tissues examined. Immunofluorescence analysis showed
that epitope-tagged MARCH4 colocalized with markers of the Golgi
apparatus.

GENE FUNCTION

Gong et al. (2003) described a large-scale screen to create an atlas of
CNS gene expression at the cellular level, and to provide a library of
verified bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) vectors and transgenic
mouse lines that offer experimental access to CNS regions, cell classes,
and pathways. They found that P271, a novel protein with a single
proline-rich domain that is closely related to human KIAA1399, is
expressed predominantly in layer 2 and 5 pyramidal cells. The morphology
of expressing cells was clearly evident, including the ramifications of
basal dendrites within layer 5 and extension of the apical dendrite and
its elaboration within layer 1 of the developing and adult cortex.

Bartee et al. (2004) showed that the isolated RING-CH domain of MARCH4
functioned as an E3 ubiquitin ligase in a reaction containing ubiquitin,
ATP, an E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme (see UBE1; 314370), and the E2
ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBCH2 (UBE2H; 601082), but not other E2
enzymes examined. Following transfection into HeLa cells, MARCH4
downregulated the surface expression of cotransfected CD4 (186940) and
endogenous MHC I. Mutation analysis revealed that the RING-CH domain of
MARCH4 was required for downregulation of MHC I surface expression, and
additional sequences in the MARCH4 N- and C-terminal ends contributed to
internalization. MHC I was internalized to lysosomes via multivesicular
bodies, and inhibition of endosome acidification or expression of a
dominant-negative VPS4 (see 609982) mutant abrogated MARCH4-induced MHC
I internalization. Deletion of lysines in the tails of HLA-A2.1 (600642)
and CD4 made these proteins resistant to MARCH9-induced degradation,
suggesting that ubiquitination of these lysines is required for their
uptake and degradation.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the
KIAA1399 gene to chromosome 2 (TMAP SGC32061).

610621	TITLE *610621 INTURNED, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF; INTU
;;KIAA1284;;
PDZ DOMAIN-CONTAINING 6; PDZK6
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned INTU, which they designated
KIAA1284. The deduced 953-amino acid protein contains a PDZ domain.
RT-PCR ELISA detected highest expression in kidney, ovary, and fetal
brain, intermediate expression in heart, adult brain, liver, lung, and
skeletal muscle, and little to no expression in pancreas, spleen, and
fetal liver. INTU was expressed in all specific adult brain regions
examined with highest levels in amygdala, corpus callosum, caudate
nucleus, substantia nigra, subthalamic nucleus, and spinal cord.

By in situ hybridization of Xenopus embryos, Park et al. (2006) found
that Xint, the frog homolog of INTU, was expressed in the neural plate
during neural tube closure, with subsequent strong expression in the
ventral neural tube and in facial mesenchyme.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1999) mapped the INTU gene
to chromosome 4. By genomic sequence analysis, Park et al. (2006) mapped
the INTU gene to chromosome 4q28.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using an antisense morpholino-oligonucleotide, Park et al. (2006)
disrupted Xint expression in Xenopus embryos. Knockdown of Xint
disrupted Hedgehog (600725) signaling and caused defects in neural tube
closure, including exencephaly, spina bifida, and holoprosencephaly-like
features. The authors found that the Hedgehog defect in Xint-deficient
embryos was secondary to a failure of ciliogenesis and that Xint and
Fuzzy (FUZ; 610622) controlled the assembly of an apical actin network
that is essential for the normal orientation of ciliary microtubules.
Fluorescence microscopy revealed colocalization of Xint and Dishevelled
(601365) at the apical surface of ciliated Xenopus epidermal cells. Park
et al. (2006) concluded that Inturned, Fuzzy, and Dishevelled regulate
ciliogenesis in Hedgehog-responsive cells through a conserved planar
cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway.

609290	TITLE *609290 ADENYLATE KINASE 3; AK3
;;ADENYLATE KINASE 3-LIKE 1, FORMERLY; AK3L1, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using primers based on the conserved region of mitochondrial Ak3 cDNA
from bovine, rat, and mouse, followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE, Noma
et al. (2001) cloned human AK3 from a liver cDNA library. The deduced
227-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 25.6 kD. AK3
shares 57.4% amino acid identity with AK4 (AK3L1; 103030). It shares
75%, 90%, and 91% amino acid identity with bovine, rat, and mouse Ak3,
respectively. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.2-kb transcript in all
tissues examined. Expression was highest in heart, liver, and skeletal
muscle, moderate in kidney and pancreas, and weak in brain, placenta,
and lung. Transcripts of 5, 1.8, and 1.35 kb were detected in heart,
liver, and pancreas. Western blot analysis detected AK3 at an apparent
molecular mass of 28 kD in all tissues examined. Subcellular
fractionation of mouse liver and kidney detected Ak3 in the
mitochondrial fraction.

GENE FUNCTION

Noma et al. (2001) assayed recombinant AK3 expressed in E. coli and
showed that the enzyme had GTP:ATP phosphotransferase activity. Human
embryonic kidney cells had endogenous phosphotransferase activity, which
increased following transfection of AK3 cDNA.

MAPPING

By study of somatic cell hybrids, Povey et al. (1976) assigned the AK3
gene to chromosome 9. The smallest region of overlap for AK3 was
estimated to be 9p24-p13 (Robson and Meera Khan, 1982).

By interspecific backcross linkage analysis, Pilz et al. (1995) mapped
the Ak3 gene to mouse chromosome 4.

606112	TITLE *606112 RIBONUCLEASE P, 14-KD SUBUNIT; RPP14
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ribonuclease P (RNase P) removes the 5-prime leader sequences from
precursor tRNA molecules. RNase P consists of an RNA species (H1 RNA),
the POP1 protein (602486), and at least 7 proteins called RPPs. The RPPs
have apparent molecular masses of 14 kD (RPP14), 20 kD (RPP20; 606113),
25 kD (RPP25), 29 kD (RPP29; 606114), 30 kD (RPP30; 606115), 38 kD
(RPP38; 606116), and 40 kD (RPP40; 606117). Patients with scleroderma
(181750) have serum reactive with RNase P, the Th antigen, which is also
referred to as the To antigen, and RPP30 and RPP38 (summary by Jarrous
et al., 1998, 1999).

CLONING

By biochemical purification of RNase P, micropeptide sequence analysis,
and EST database searching, Jarrous et al. (1999) obtained a cDNA
encoding RPP14. The deduced basic protein has 124 amino acids and a
predicted molecular mass of nearly 14 kD. Immunoblot analysis showed
that antibodies to RPP14 or RPP29 precipitate native RNase P.

MAPPING

Gross (2013) mapped the RPP14 gene to chromosome 3p14.3 based on an
alignment of the RPP14 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF001175) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

611312	TITLE *611312 CORNULIN; CRNN
;;CHROMOSOME 1 OPEN READING FRAME 10; C1ORF10;;
PDRC1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using differential display PCR to compare genes expressed in esophageal
cancer tissues to those expressed in adjacent normal esophageal mucosa,
Xu et al. (2000) identified a differentially expressed transcript, which
they named C1ORF10. The C1ORF10 cDNA encodes a deduced 490-amino acid
protein with 1 transmembrane domain, an N-terminal EF-hand
calcium-binding motif of about 90 amino acids that shares 25 to 35%
identity to human S100 calcium-binding proteins (e.g., 114085), and a
conserved consecutive repeat sequence of about 60 amino acids. Northern
blot analysis of 16 human adult tissues revealed restricted expression
of an approximately 2.0-kb C1ORF10 transcript in esophagus. Expression
in esophageal cancer tissue was greatly reduced or absent compared to
the expression in matched adjacent normal esophageal mucosa.

Contzler et al. (2005) further characterized the C10ORF10 protein, which
they called cornulin. They found that the protein contains 2 EF-hand
domains in the N terminus and shares sequence and structural identity
with members of the 'fused protein' family (e.g., repetin) as well as
with members of the S100 protein family. RT-PCR analysis detected
expression of cornulin in fetal bladder, scalp skin, foreskin, and in
cultured primary keratinocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a Ca2+ overlay assay, Contzler et al. (2005) demonstrated that the
EF-hand domains of cornulin bind calcium. Confocal microscopy of HeLa
cells transfected with EGFP-labeled cornulin showed that cornulin was
distributed throughout the cytoplasm with denser staining occurring
around the nucleus; deletion of the EF-hand domains resulted in a
granular pattern of staining throughout the whole cell.
Immunofluorescence studies showed cornulin staining in the granular and
lower cornified cells of foreskin and also in the granular layer and
inner root sheath of the hair follicle in scalp skin; prominent staining
was observed on esophagus sections at the periphery of the cells of the
granular and the upper spinous layers. Because expression of cornulin
was especially high in Ca(2+)-differentiating cells, Contzler et al.
(2005) suggested that cornulin is a marker of late epidermal
differentiation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Xu et al. (2000) determined that the C1ORF10 gene contains 3 exons, the
first of which is noncoding, and spans 5 kb.

Contzler et al. (2005) found that the gene structure of C1ORF10 is
similar to that of members of the 'fused gene' family. C1ORF10 has a
short first noncoding exon, a long intron 1, a second exon containing
the initiation codon and the first EF-hand motif, and a third exon
containing the second EF-hand motif.

MAPPING

Using a radiation hybrid panel, Xu et al. (2000) mapped the
C1ORf10/cornulin gene to human chromosome 1q21. By sequence analysis,
Contzler et al. (2005) mapped the gene within the epidermal
differentiation complex on 1q21, very close to other members of the
'fused gene' family.

602327	TITLE *602327 PLECKSTRIN AND SEC7 DOMAINS-CONTAINING PROTEIN; PSD
;;TYL;;
EXCHANGE FACTOR FOR ARF6; EFA6;;
EFA6A
DESCRIPTION Perletti et al. (1997) identified a novel human gene on 10q24,
contiguous to the 3-prime end of the NFKB2 gene (164012) in a
tail-to-tail arrangement. They described a cDNA of 4,307 bp, isolated
from an adult human brain cDNA library, which contains an open reading
frame encoding a putative protein of 645 amino acids with a predicted
molecular weight of 71 kD. Database homology searches indicated that the
novel gene codes for a putative protein containing 2 discrete domains
with significant homology to the Sec7 and pleckstrin-homology (PH)
domains, respectively. They used the gene symbol PSD for
'pleckstrin-Sec7 domains.' Northern blot analysis of a panel of RNAs
from normal human tissues using the PSD cDNA as probe revealed the
presence of 3 different tissue-specific transcripts of approximately
4.3, 2.3, and 1.8 kb, the longest of which was expressed only in brain.
The data suggested that the PSD gene may encode a protein related to the
protein family containing both the Sec7 in the PH domains and thought to
be involved in signaling transduction processes. Other human proteins in
the same family include cytohesin-1 (Kolanus et al., 1996) and ARNO
(602488) (Chardin et al., 1996).

Derrien et al. (2002) reported that PSD, which they called EFA6A, is 63%
identical to EFA6B (PSD4; 614442) and contains a Sec7 domain adjacent to
a PH domain, followed by a C-terminal coiled-coil motif. Northern blot
analysis showed that EFA6A expression was largely restricted to brain,
with a smaller transcript expressed in small intestine, colon, and
ovary. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated punctate cell surface
expression of ARF6 (600464) and EFA6A, like EFA6B, in transfected baby
hamster kidney cells. Both EFA6 proteins also colocalized with F-actin
(see 102610).

GENE FUNCTION

Derrien et al. (2002) found that recombinant EFA6A stimulated nucleotide
exchange on myristoylated ARF6, with only low activity on ARF1 (103180).
The C-terminal region was involved in microvilli lengthening. Derrien et
al. (2002) concluded that EFA6 family guanine exchange factors are
modular proteins that work through the coordinated action of the
catalytic Sec7 domain to promote ARF6 activation, through the PH domain
to regulate association with specific subdomains of the plasma membrane,
and through the C-terminal region to control actin cytoskeletal
reorganization.

MAPPING

Gross (2012) mapped the PSD gene to chromosome 10q24.32 based on an
alignment of the PSD sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC142689) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

607558	TITLE *607558 SEC14-LIKE 2; SEC14L2
;;SEC14, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF, 2;;
TOCOPHEROL-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1; TAP1;;
TAP KIAA1186
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Hirosawa et al. (1999) cloned a partial cDNA encoding SEC14L2,
which they designated KIAA1186. RT-PCR followed by ELISA detected
moderate expression in kidney, spleen, testis, ovary, and fetal liver.
Lower levels were detected in whole brain, lung, and adult liver.

Zimmer et al. (2000) sequenced peptide fragments from bovine SEC14L2,
which they called TAP, and searched a database using these sequences to
identify human TAP. Using RT-PCR they cloned full-length TAP from human
small intestine total RNA. The deduced 403-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of about 46 kD and contains a conserved
hydrophobic lipid-binding pocket called the CRAL (cis-retinal
binding)/TRIO (triple function) domain. Human and bovine TAP share about
84% amino acid identity. mRNA dot blot analysis detected broad tissue
distribution, with highest expression in liver, prostate, and brain.
Northern blot analysis detected a major transcript of 2.8 kb and 2 minor
transcripts of approximately 4.2 and 2.8 kb expressed at highest levels
in liver and brain and more weakly in kidney.

By immunocytochemical studies, Kempna et al. (2003) showed that SEC14L2
localized to intracellular membranes of the cytoplasm in HeLa cells,
including partial localization to the ER and Golgi, with more intense
staining surrounding but not within the nucleus.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a biotinylated alpha-tocopherol derivative, Zimmer et al. (2000)
demonstrated that recombinant TAP binds alpha-tocopherol at physiologic
concentrations. Binding was dose dependent and saturable.

By ligand competition analysis, Yamauchi et al. (2001) confirmed
specific interaction between recombinant TAP and alpha-tocopherol. TAP
did not significantly interact with any other tocopherols or
tocotrienols examined. Alpha-tocopherol induced the translocation of TAP
from the cytosol to the nucleus of transfected COS-7 cells. Transient
transfection experiments showed that TAP activated transcription of a
reporter gene in an alpha-tocopherol-dependent manner. Yamauchi et al.
(2001) hypothesized that alpha-tocopherol is not only an antioxidant,
but also a transcriptional regulator via its association with TAP.

Kempna et al. (2003) showed that in HeLa cells deletion of the
C-terminal Golgi dynamics (GOLD) domain reduced SEC14L2 localization in
the region surrounding the nucleus with some tubular sacs emerging. They
suggested that the SEC14L2 GOLD domain may play a role in docking to
other proteins or in intracellular transport of bound ligands. Using
several assays, Kempna et al. (2003) demonstrated that SEC14L2 bound
tocopherol, squalene, and phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine,
phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylglycerol). Although SEC14L2 bound
phospholipids, it failed to complement an S. cerevisiae
temperature-sensitive Sec14 allele in yeast. Using immunoprecipitation
assays, Kempna et al. (2003) showed that SEC14L2 may interact with and
regulate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity, and SEC14L2 displayed
low basal GTPase activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zimmer et al. (2000) determined that the SEC14L2 gene contains 12 exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Hirosawa et al. (1999) mapped the SEC14L2
gene to chromosome 22. By genomic sequence analysis, Zimmer et al.
(2000) mapped the SEC14L2 gene to chromosome 22q12.1-qter.

137780	TITLE *137780 GLIAL FIBRILLARY ACIDIC PROTEIN; GFAP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Glial fibrillary acidic protein is an intermediate-filament (IF) protein
that is highly specific for cells of astroglial lineage. Reeves et al.
(1989) isolated a cDNA encoding GFAP and determined its nucleotide
sequence. The predicted amino acid sequence indicated that GFAP shares
structural similarities--particularly in the central rod domain and to a
lesser degree in the carboxyl-terminal domain--with other IF proteins
found in nonepithelial cell types. Considerable sequence divergence in
the amino-terminal region of GFAP suggested that the tissue-specific
functions of this IF protein may be mediated through this region of the
molecule. GFAP is a useful marker of astroglia in the brain.

Using PS1 (104311) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen, Nielsen et al.
(2002) cloned a splice variant of GFAP, which they called GFAP-epsilon,
from a fetal brain cDNA library. GFAP-epsilon contains 42 amino acids
encoded by exon 7a at its C terminus in place of the 43-amino acid C
terminus encoded by exons 8 and 9 of GFAP-alpha, the originally
identified GFAP transcript.

MAPPING

Bernier et al. (1988) used cDNA probes to determine the chromosomal
location of the GFAP gene in the mouse by following its segregation in a
panel of interspecies somatic cell hybrids. Furthermore, they defined
RFLPs associated with the gene. Patterns of inheritance of these RFLPs
in recombinant inbred strains of mice showed that GFAP is encoded by a
single genetic locus on mouse chromosome 11. The murine gene is in close
proximity to the genes encoding p53 and myeloperoxidase. By Southern
blot hybridization of somatic cell hybrids and by in situ hybridization,
Bongcam-Rudloff et al. (1991) mapped the GFAP gene to human 17q21.
Brownell et al. (1991) also assigned the GFAP gene to chromosome 17 by
screening a mouse/human somatic cell hybrid panel with a GFAP cDNA
fragment.

GENE FUNCTION

Using binding assays with recombinant proteins, Nielsen et al. (2002)
determined that the unique C terminus of the GFAP-epsilon splice variant
was required for interaction with PS1, as were the coiled-coil 2 and
linker 1-2 regions shared with GFAP-alpha. GFAP-alpha did not interact
with PS1. Yeast 2-hybrid analysis of point mutations introduced into PS1
indicated that 2 nonconservative amino acid substitutions abolished
interaction with GFAP-epsilon, but 2 conservative substitutions, both
associated with Alzheimer disease, did not effect GFAP-epsilon binding.
By transfection in human embryonic kidney cells and in mouse
neuroblastoma cells, Nielsen et al. (2002)found that GFAP-epsilon
associated with intermediate filaments and perfectly colocalized with
GFAP-alpha, suggesting that both isoforms are polymerized into the same
filamentous structures. A subpopulation of GFAP-epsilon also colocalized
with PS1 in the perinuclear region and in cytoplasmic granules.

Radomska et al. (2013) stated that 3 major GFAP splice variants,
GFAP-alpha, -delta, and -kappa, are present in human central nervous
system. They found that GFAP-alpha was the dominant GFAP variant in
primary cultured human astrocytes. Knockdown of the RNA-binding protein
QKI (609590), predominantly the QKI7 variant, reduced astrocyte content
of GFAP-alpha mRNA. Treatment of astrocytes with the antipsychotic drug
haloperidol increased the expression of both QKI7 and GFAP-alpha.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Alexander disease (203450) is a rare disorder of the central nervous
system. Infants with Alexander disease develop a leukoencephalopathy
with macrocephaly, seizures, and psychomotor retardation, leading to
death usually within the first decade; patients with juvenile or adult
forms typically experience ataxia, bulbar signs and spasticity, and a
more slowly progressive course. The pathologic hallmark of all forms of
Alexander disease is the presence of Rosenthal fibers, cytoplasmic
inclusions in astrocytes that contain the intermediate filament protein
GFAP in association with small heat-shock proteins. By sequence analysis
of DNA from patients representing different Alexander disease
phenotypes, Brenner et al. (2001) found that most cases were associated
with nonconservative mutations in the coding region of the GFAP gene.
Alexander disease, therefore, represents the first example of a primary
genetic disorder of astrocytes, one of the major cell types in the
vertebrate CNS. Each mutation identified in the GFAP gene was
heterozygous, suggesting a dominant mutation. Because parental DNA was
normal in all instances where it was available, the authors concluded
that most cases of Alexander disease result from de novo mutations. It
was noteworthy that mutations in only 4 codons accounted for Alexander
disease in 10 of 11 patients, and these were all arginine codons.
Arginine codons are recognized as particularly prone to mutation,
presumably due to methylation of the CpG dinucleotide. Brenner et al.
(2001) suggested that the GFAP mutations in Alexander disease most
likely act in a dominant gain-of-function manner, as the phenotype of
Gfap-null mice is subtle and does not resemble Alexander disease. They
pointed out that the results do not exclude the possibility that defects
in other genes may be responsible for some cases of Alexander disease.
For example, Schuelke et al. (1999) reported a child with a phenotype
resembling Alexander disease (but without pathologic confirmation) who
was homozygous for a mutation in the NDUFV1 gene (161015.0003).

Rodriguez et al. (2001) searched for GFAP mutations in a series of
patients who had heterogeneous clinical symptoms but were candidates for
Alexander disease on the basis of suggestive neuroimaging abnormalities.
De novo heterozygous missense GFAP mutations were found in exon 1 or
exon 4 in 14 of the 15 patients analyzed, including patients without
macrocephaly. Nine patients carried arginine mutations that had been
described elsewhere: 4 had arg239 to cys (137780.0001); 1 had arg239 to
his (137780.0002); and 1 had arg79 to his (137780.0004). The other 5
patients had 1 of 4 novel mutations, of which 2 affected arginine and 2
affected nonarginine residues. All mutations were located in the rod
domain of GFAP, and there was a correlation between clinical severity
and the affected amino acid.

Li et al. (2005) identified mutations in the GFAP gene in 41 patients
with Alexander disease. They stated that a total of 42 different GFAP
mutations had been identified, and almost all mutations resulted in a
gain-of-function dominant effect. There was a suggestion of male
predominance of the disorder.

Li et al. (2006) determined that the paternal chromosome carried the
GFAP mutation in 24 of 28 unrelated cases of Alexander disease analyzed,
suggesting that most mutations occur during spermatogenesis rather than
in the embryo. No effect of paternal age was observed.

In 13 unrelated Italian patients with Alexander disease, including 8
with the infantile, 2 with the juvenile, and 3 with the adult form,
Caroli et al. (2007) identified 11 different mutations in the GFAP gene
(see, e.g., 137780.0005), including 4 novel mutations. Ten mutations
occurred in the rod domains and 1 in the tail domain.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Rodriguez et al. (2001) could discern a genotype-phenotype correlation
for the 2 most frequently mutated arginine residues, R79 (8 patients)
and R239 (10 patients), with the phenotype of the R79 mutations
appearing much less severe than that of the R239 mutations. The 4
patients they found with R79 mutations appeared to be the least severely
affected: none developed macrocephaly, 3 achieved independent walking,
and, at the time of report, all were alive at ages 2.5 to 20 years.
Similarly, among the 4 patients with R79 mutations who were reported by
Brenner et al. (2001), 2 lived until the ages of 14 and 48 years, the
other 2 were still alive, at ages 7 and 8 years, at the time of report
by Rodriguez et al. (2001). Patients with R239 mutations, reported by
both Brenner et al. (2001) and Rodriguez et al. (2001), had marked
impairment of psychomotor development, and some had progressive
macrocephaly.

Gorospe et al. (2002) reported 12 genetically confirmed cases of
Alexander disease caused by 9 heterozygous point mutations in the GFAP
gene. The cases demonstrated variable ages of onset and symptoms. The
authors stated that no clear-cut genotype-phenotype correlations were
apparent.

ANIMAL MODEL

Messing et al. (1998) found that overexpression of human GFAP in
astrocytes of transgenic mice was fatal and was accompanied by the
presence of inclusion bodies indistinguishable from human Rosenthal
fibers, the pathologic hallmark of all forms of Alexander disease. These
results suggested that a primary alteration in the GFAP gene may be
responsible for Alexander disease.

Gomi et al. (1995), Pekny et al. (1995), Shibuki et al. (1996), and
Liedtke et al. (1996) independently reported generation of
GFAP-deficient mice. In all cases, the mutant mice are normal at birth
and develop grossly normal. Using immunohistochemical analysis, Pekny et
al. (1995) concluded that GFAP knockout mice are lacking intermediate
filaments in astrocytes of the hippocampus and in the white matter of
the spinal cord. Using microscopic analysis of brain sections, Liedtke
et al. (1996) observed a mutant phenotype characterized by abnormal
myelination, alterations in the blood-brain barrier, disorganization of
white matter architecture and vascularization, and hydrocephalus in
older mice associated with loss of white matter. They concluded that
GFAP is necessary for the long-term maintenance of normal CNS
myelination. Shibuki et al. (1996) observed that long-term depression at
parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses is deficient in GFAP knockout
mice. Furthermore, GFAP mutant mice exhibited a significant impairment
of eyeblink conditioning without any detectable deficits in motor
coordination tasks. They concluded that GFAP may be required for
communications between Bergmann glia and Purkinje cells during long-term
depression induction and maintenance.

Hagemann et al. (2005) performed gene expression analysis on olfactory
bulbs of transgenic mice overexpressing wildtype human GFAP at 2
different ages. Expression profiles revealed a stress response that
included genes involved in glutathione metabolism, peroxide
detoxification, and iron homeostasis. Many of these genes are regulated
by the transcription factor Nfe2l2 (600492), which is also increased in
expression at 3 weeks. An immune-related response occurred with
activation of cytokine and cytokine receptor genes, complement
components, and acute phase response genes. These transcripts were
further elevated with age, with additional induction of
macrophage-specific markers, such as Mac1 (ITGAM; 120980) and CD68
(153634), suggesting activation of microglia. At 4 months, decreased
expression of genes for microtubule-associated proteins, vesicular
trafficking proteins, and neurotransmitter receptors became apparent.
Interneuron-specific transcription factors, including Dlx family members
and Pax6 (607108), were downregulated as well as Gad1 (605363) and Gad2
(138275), suggesting impairment of GABAergic granule cells. Hagemann et
al. (2005) proposed a mechanism wherein an initial stress response by
astrocytes results in the activation of microglia and compromised
neuronal function.

Hagemann et al. (2009) noted that Rosenthal fibers in the complex
astrocytic inclusions characteristic of Alexander disease contain GFAP,
vimentin (VIM; 193060), plectin (PLEC1; 601282), ubiquitin (UBB;
191339), HSP27 (HSPB1; 602195), and alpha-B-crystallin (CRYAB; 123590).
CRYAB regulates GFAP assembly, and elevation of CRYAB is a consistent
feature of Alexander disease; however, its role in Rosenthal fibers and
disease pathology is not known. In a mouse model of Alexander disease,
Hagemann et al. (2009) showed that loss of Cryab resulted in increased
mortality, whereas elevation of Cryab rescued animals from terminal
seizures. When mice with Rosenthal fibers induced by overexpression of
GFAP were crossed into a Cryab-null background, over half died at 1
month of age. Restoration of Cryab expression through the GFAP promoter
reversed this outcome, showing the effect was astrocyte-specific.
Conversely, in mice carrying an Alexander disease-associated mutation
and in mice overexpressing wildtype GFAP, which, despite natural
induction of Cryab also died at 1 month, transgenic overexpression of
Cryab resulted in a markedly reduced CNS stress response, restored
expression of the glutamate transporter Glt1 (SLC1A2; 600300), and
protected these animals from death.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, ARG239CYS

Brenner et al. (2001) found that 5 unrelated patients with Alexander
disease (203450) were heterozygous for mutations in codon 239 of the
GFAP gene. In 4 of these, a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 729 led to
an arg239-to-cys mutation (R239C). Age at death in these 4 patients
varied from 4 years to 11 years. The fifth patient had an arg239-to-his
mutation (137780.0002). DNA was normal in the parents where available.

In a 1-year-old female with typical features of Alexander disease,
Shiroma et al. (2001) identified the frequent R239C missense mutation.
The patient was born of nonconsanguineous parents. Early developmental
milestones were normal, but at the age of 1 year she had the first
febrile seizure, and after 2 weeks she had status epilepticus with
fever. Thereafter, she lost the ability to stand with help and to speak
words. Examination showed increased head circumference (+2.3 SD) and
good social response. Plantar responses were bilaterally extensor. In
addition to the typical manifestations of macrocephaly, psychomotor
retardation, spasticity, and seizures, the radiologic findings were
typical of Alexander disease.

Rodriguez et al. (2001) found the arg239-to-cys mutation in heterozygous
state in 4 of 14 patients with infantile Alexander disease. One of the
patients was 18 months old at the time of onset, underwent deterioration
of psychomotor development at the age of 6 years, had a head
circumference of 1.5 standard deviations above the mean, and was alive
at age 8 years.

Li et al. (2005) reported 2 unrelated patients with juvenile-onset
Alexander disease who were heterozygous for the R239C mutation. One
patient had onset at age 2 years and the other at age 4 years.

.0002
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, ARG239HIS

In a patient with Alexander disease (203450), Brenner et al. (2001)
identified a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 730 of the GFAP gene,
causing an arg239-to-his substitution. This infant died at the age of 11
months. Four other patients had an arg239-to-cys mutation; see
137780.0001.

Li et al. (2005) reported 5 unrelated patients with Alexander disease
resulting from the R239H mutation. All patients had a severe form of the
disease, with onset by age 6 months and death by age 5 years.

.0003
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, ARG416TRP

In 2 unrelated patients with Alexander disease (203450) that led to
death at ages 7 and 8, respectively, Brenner et al. (2001) identified a
C-to-T transition at nucleotide 1260 of the GFAP gene, resulting in an
arg416-to-trp substitution.

Li et al. (2005) noted that the R416W mutation had been identified in
patients with infantile-, juvenile-, and adult-onset Alexander disease.

A pathologic hallmark of Alexander disease is the abundance of protein
aggregates in astrocytes. These aggregates, termed Rosenthal fibers,
contain the protein chaperones alpha-B crystallin (123590) and HSP27
(602195) as well as GFAP. Perng et al. (2006) showed that the R416W
mutation in GFAP significantly perturbs in vitro filament assembly. The
filamentous structures formed resemble assembly intermediates but
aggregated more strongly. Consistent with the heterozygosity of the
mutation, this effect was dominant over wildtype GFAP in coassembly
experiments. Transient transfection studies demonstrated that R416W GFAP
induces the formation of GFAP-containing cytoplasmic aggregates in a
wide range of different cell types, including astrocytes. Monoclonal
antibodies specific for R146W GFAP revealed, for the first time for any
intermediate filament-based disease, the presence of the mutant protein
in the characteristic histopathologic features of the disease, namely,
Rosenthal fibers. The data confirmed that the effects of the R416W GFAP
are dominant, changing the assembly process in a way that encourages
aberrant filament-filament interactions that then lead to protein
aggregation and chaperone sequestration as early events in Alexander
disease.

.0004
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, ARG79HIS

In a patient with Alexander disease (203450) with onset at age 10 years
and death at age 48 years, Brenner et al. (2001) identified a G-to-A
transition at nucleotide 250 of the GFAP gene, leading to an
arg79-to-his substitution. Brenner et al. (2001) found the same mutation
in a patient with Alexander disease still living at the age of 8 years.

.0005
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, ARG79CYS

In a patient with Alexander disease (203450) with onset at 3 months and
death at 14 years, Brenner et al. (2001) identified a C-to-T transition
at nucleotide 249 of the GFAP gene, leading to an arg79-to-cys (R79C)
substitution. Brenner et al. (2001) found the same mutation in a patient
with Alexander disease still living at the age of 7 years.

Caroli et al. (2007) identified the R79C mutation in 3 unrelated Italian
boys with Alexander disease. All had onset before age 10 months. One of
the patients died at age 19 years.

.0006
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, ARG88CYS

In 2 unrelated patients with Alexander disease (203450), Rodriguez et
al. (2001) found an arg88-to-cys (R88C) mutation in the GFAP gene.

.0007
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, ARG88SER

In a patient with Alexander disease (203450), Rodriguez et al. (2001)
found an arg88-to-ser (R88S) missense mutation in heterozygous state in
the GFAP gene.

.0008
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, LEU76PHE

In a patient with Alexander disease (203450), Rodriguez et al. (2001)
found a leu76-to-phe (L76F) heterozygous missense mutation in the GFAP
gene.

.0009
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, ASN77TYR

In a patient with Alexander disease (203450), Rodriguez et al. (2001)
found a de novo, heterozygous missense mutation, asn77-to-tyr (N77Y), in
the GFAP gene.

.0010
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, GLU362ASP

In a patient with juvenile-onset Alexander disease (203450), Sawaishi et
al. (2002) identified a homozygous 1100G-C transition in the GFAP gene,
resulting in a glu362-to-asp substitution. A brother and the parents did
not carry the mutation. The mutation occurred in the C-terminal end of
the central rod domain, a highly conserved region of GFAP and other
types of intermediate filaments (e.g., vimentin (193060), desmin
(125660), keratin-1 (139350)).

.0011
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, ARG276LEU

In 2 Japanese brothers with Alexander disease (203450), Namekawa et al.
(2002) described an 841G-T transition at nucleotide 841, resulting in an
arg276-to-leu (R276L) substitution. Both brothers had spastic paresis
without palatal myoclonus, and MRI showed marked atrophy of the medulla
oblongata and cervicothoracic cord. The autopsy showed severely involved
shrunken pyramids but scarce Rosenthal fibers. Moderate numbers of
Rosenthal fibers were observed in the stratum subcallosum and
hippocampal fimbria. One patient was well until age 33; the second
brother developed regressive spastic gait at the age of 48 years and
gradually noticed that he could not raise his left arm. The parents were
nonconsanguineous and both died in their eighth decade without apparent
evidence of a neurologic disorder. They had only the 2 offspring, both
of whom had no children. The R276L mutation was heterozygous in both
brothers. Assuming accurate attribution of paternity, one might suggest
that this represented an example of parental gonadal mosaicism.

.0012
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, LEU352PRO

In a patient with a severe form of infantile Alexander disease (203450),
Bassuk et al. (2003) identified a heterozygous 1055T-C transition in the
GFAP gene, resulting in a leu352-to-pro (L352P) substitution. Residue
352 is a highly conserved amino acid that is found in all intermediate
filament proteins and across species.

.0013
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, ASP78GLU

In a family with an autosomal dominant adult form of Alexander disease
(203450), Stumpf et al. (2003) identified a heterozygous C-to-A change
in exon 1 of the GFAP gene, resulting in an asp78-to-glu (D78E)
substitution. Amino acid 78 lies in the rod domain of the protein. The
clinical phenotype varied in severity, but the pattern of evolution was
similar in all affected members. Although sleep disturbances and
dysautonomia, primarily constipation, began in childhood, the major
neurologic features began in the third or fourth decade of life. MRI of
the older patients showed atrophy of the medulla without signal
abnormalities.

606538	TITLE *606538 MYOSIN IC; MYO1C
;;MYOSIN 2, RAT, HOMOLOG OF; MYR2;;
NUCLEAR MYOSIN I; NMI
DESCRIPTION Myosins are molecular motors that, upon interaction with actin
filaments, utilize energy from ATP hydrolysis to generate mechanical
force. For further background information on myosins, see MYO1A
(601478).

CLONING

By screening a kidney cDNA library with a mouse Myo1c probe, Crozet et
al. (1997) obtained a human cDNA encoding MYO1C. The deduced 1,028-amino
acid protein, which is 96% identical to the mouse protein, contains ATP-
and actin-binding sequences in the motor (or head) domain, followed by
three 23-residue IQ motifs and a tail domain rich in basic residues that
is expected to interact with negatively charged membrane phospholipids.
Northern blot analysis revealed ubiquitous expression of Myo1c in adult
mouse tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

MYO1C, also known as myosin I-beta and MYR2, was thought to mediate the
slow component of adaptation by hair cells, the sensory cells of the
inner ear. To test this hypothesis, Holt et al. (2002) mutated tyr61 of
MYO1C to gly, conferring susceptibility to inhibition by N6-modified ADP
analogs. They expressed the mutant MYO1C in utricular hair cells of
transgenic mice, delivered an ADP analog through a whole-cell recording
pipette, and found that the analog rapidly blocked adaptation to
positive and negative deflections in transgenic cells but not in
wildtype cells. The speed and specificity of inhibition suggested that
MYO1C participates in adaptation in hair cells.

Bose et al. (2002) reported that the unconventional myosin MYO1C is
present in GLUT4 (138190)-containing vesicles purified from 3T3-L1
adipocytes. MYO1C is highly expressed in primary and cultured
adipocytes. Insulin (176730) enhances the localization of MYO1C with
GLUT4 in cortical tubulovesicular structures associated with actin
filaments, and this colocalization is insensitive to wortmannin.
Insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4 to the adipocyte plasma
membrane is augmented by the expression of wildtype MYO1C and inhibited
by a dominant-negative cargo domain of MYO1C. A decrease in the
expression of endogenous MYO1C mediated by small interfering RNAs
inhibited insulin-stimulated uptake of 2-deoxyglucose. Thus, Bose et al.
(2002) concluded that MYO1C functions in a
phosphatidylinositol-3-hydroxykinase (PI3K; see 601232)-independent
insulin signaling pathway that controls the movement of intracellular
GLUT4-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane.

MAPPING

Using PCR and radiation hybrid analysis, Crozet et al. (1997) mapped the
MYO1C gene to 17p13.

HISTORY

A report by Nunez et al. (2008) indicating that 3-dimensional
motor-dependent interchromosomal interactions involving MYO1C are
required to achieve enhanced transcription of specific estrogen-receptor
target genes was retracted.

609011	TITLE *609011 VASOHIBIN 1; VASH1
;;KIAA1036
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Kikuno et al. (1999) cloned VASH1, which they called KIAA1036.
The deduced protein contains 365 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA detected
intermediate expression in adult heart, brain, lung, liver, kidney,
ovary, and spinal cord, as well as in fetal brain. Lower expression was
detected in skeletal muscle, testis, pancreas, and fetal liver, and
little to no expression was detected in spleen. All specific adult brain
regions examined showed low to moderate expression.

By microarray analysis, Watanabe et al. (2004) found that the KIAA1036
gene was upregulated in endothelial cells (ECs) by VEGF (192240), and
they renamed the gene vasohibin. The deduced vasohibin protein contains
a cluster of basic amino acids in its C terminus and no classic
secretion signal sequence. Northern blot analysis revealed prominent
expression in brain and placenta, and lower expression in heart and
kidney. Vasohibin expression was robust between embryonic weeks 6 to 12
in heart, brain, kidney, lung, skeletal muscle, and whole embryo.
Immunohistochemical analysis detected vasohibin at the endothelial layer
of placenta and brain. Western blot analysis detected vasohibin at an
apparent molecular mass of 42 kD in intact human umbilical vein ECs and
at 30 kD in the medium, indicating proteolytic processing during
secretion.

GENE FUNCTION

Following expression in insect cells, Watanabe et al. (2004) found that
recombinant vasohibin inhibited the migration, proliferation, and
network formation by ECs as well as angiogenesis in vivo. The inhibitory
effect was selective to ECs, as the protein did not affect the migration
of smooth muscle cells or fibroblasts. Eliminating the expression of
vasohibin in ECs restored their responsiveness to higher concentrations
of VEGF. Expression of vasohibin was selective to ECs, and hypoxia or
TNFA (191160) abrogated its inducible expression. Transfection of Lewis
lung carcinoma cells with the vasohibin gene did not affect the
proliferation of the cancer cells in vitro, but did inhibit tumor growth
and tumor angiogenesis in vivo in mice. Watanabe et al. (2004) concluded
that vasohibin is an endothelium-derived negative feedback regulator of
angiogenesis.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the VASH1
gene to chromosome 14 (TMAP RH80381).

606439	TITLE *606439 ATLASTIN GTPase 1; ATL1
;;ATLASTIN;;
SPG3A GENE; SPG3A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ATL1 gene encodes atlastin-1, a dynamin-related GTPase, which plays
a role in formation of the tubular endoplasmic reticulum (ER) network
and in axon elongation in neurons (Zhu et al., 2006; Orso et al., 2009).

CLONING

By positional cloning, Zhao et al. (2001) demonstrated that a form of
autosomal dominant hereditary spastic paraplegia with early onset
(SPG3A; 182600), before the age of 10 years and usually before the age
of 5, is caused by mutation in a GTPase gene. The gene was found to have
no homology to genes that cause other forms of hereditary spastic
paraplegia. It does show significant homology to guanylate binding
protein-1 (GBP1; 600411), a member of the dynamin family of large
GTPases. Northern blot analysis of ATL1 expression detected a 2.2-kb
transcript primarily in adult and fetal brain. RT-PCR experiments
indicated measurable expression in all tissues examined, although
expression in adult brain was at least 50-fold higher than in other
tissues. Translation of the 2.2-kb cDNA sequence of ATL1 yielded a
peptide of 558 amino acids.

By PCR of a cerebral cortex cDNA library, Zhu et al. (2003) cloned ATL1,
which they called atlastin-1. The deduced 558-amino acid protein
contains GTP-binding motifs in its N-terminal half and 2 transmembrane
domains in its C-terminal half. It also has 3 potential N-glycosylation
sites. Western blot analysis of transfected COS-7 cells detected
atlastin-1 at an apparent molecular mass of about 64 kD. Western blot
analysis detected high atlastin-1 expression in human and rat brain
homogenates, with much lower expression in several other human tissues,
including smooth muscle, adrenal gland, kidney, testis, and lung.
Immunohistochemical analysis of rat brain sections detected high
expression of atlastin-1 in cortical neurons of lamina V, pyramidal
neurons in CA1 and CA3 of the hippocampus, and in amygdala and several
thalamic nuclei. Staining was most prominent in the cell soma, with
weaker staining of axons and dendrites. Immunogold labeling detected rat
atlastin-1 predominantly in the cis-Golgi cisternae. Protease protection
assays indicated that the N and C termini of human atlastin-1 were
exposed to the cytoplasmic face of the membrane in transfected cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay, Zhu et al. (2003) determined that
atlastin-1 self-associates. Chemical cross-linking experiments indicated
that atlastin-1 most likely forms a homotetramer of about 230 kD. Zhu et
al. (2003) demonstrated that atlastin-1 has GTPase activity.

Independently, Evans et al. (2006) and Sanderson et al. (2006)
demonstrated that the N-terminal domain of spastin (SPAST; 604277) bound
directly to the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of atlastin, suggesting
that the 2 gene products interact in a common biologic pathway. Evans et
al. (2006) used yeast 2-hybrid analysis and coimmunoprecipitation
studies in HeLa cells, and Sanderson et al. (2006) used yeast 2-hybrid
analysis of a human fetal brain cDNA library and protein pull-down,
coimmunoprecipitation, and colocalization studies in HeLa cells, HEK293T
cells, and mouse NSC34 neuronal cells.

In the developing rat brain, Zhu et al. (2006) found that atlastin-1 was
expressed not only in the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum, but
was also enriched in axonal growth cones and growth cone-like
varicosities along the axons. Atlastin-1 labeling was prominent on
vesicular structures within the growth cones, but not at the plasma
membrane and not at synapses. Knockdown of atlastin-1 using shRNA in
cultured cortical cells inhibited axonal growth. Overall, the findings
suggested that atlastin-1 has diverse functions in neurons, likely
acting both in intracellular membrane trafficking as well as in
expansion at the axonal growth cone. These functional studies suggested
that the early-onset axonopathy observed in SPG3A may result from
abnormal development of axons.

Orso et al. (2009) demonstrated that Drosophila atlastin localizes on
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes and that its loss causes ER
fragmentation. Drosophila atlastin embedded in distinct membranes has
the ability to form trans-oligomeric complexes, and its overexpression
induces enlargement of ER profiles, consistent with excessive fusion of
ER membranes. In vitro experiments confirmed that atlastin autonomously
drives membrane fusion in a GTP-dependent fashion. In contrast,
GTPase-deficient atlastin is inactive, unable to form trans-oligomeric
complexes owing to failure to self-associate, and incapable of promoting
fusion in vitro. The results of Orso et al. (2009) demonstrated that
atlastin mediates membrane tethering and fusion and strongly suggested
that it is the GTPase activity required for ER homotypic fusion.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhao et al. (2001) found that the ATL1 gene contains 14 exons and spans
approximately 69 kb.

MAPPING

Zhao et al. (2001) determined that the ATL1 gene maps to chromosome
14q11-q21. Zhu et al. (2003) stated that the ATL1 gene maps to
chromosome 14q22.1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Spastic Paraplegia 3A

Zhao et al. (2001) identified mutations in the ATL1 gene (see, e.g.,
606439.0001) in families with spastic paraplegia-3A (SPG3A; 182600) in
which linkage to 14q11-q21 had been demonstrated as well as in other
phenotypically similar families without linkage evidence.

Durr et al. (2004) identified mutations in the ATL1 gene in 12 (39%) of
31 families with early-onset autosomal dominant spastic paraplegia. One
family showed incomplete penetrance.

Namekawa et al. (2006) stated that 19 mutations in the ATL1 gene had
been identified in 40 different families. More than 90% of the mutations
were located in exons 4 (12.5%), 7 (27.5%), 8 (17.5%), and 12 (35%).

In COS-7 cells, Zhu et al. (2006) showed that disease-associated
missense mutations in the ATL1 gene were expressed and interacted
strongly with wildtype ATL1, causing a decrease in GTPase activity in a
dominant-negative manner. The GTPase impairment was strongest with the
R217Q mutation (606439.0004), which is located within the GTPase binding
site, but was also observed with other missense mutations (R239C;
606439.0001 and H258R; 606439.0003), suggesting that these regions may
modulate activity.

Beetz et al. (2007) reported a family in which spastic paraplegia
segregated with a deletion of exon 1 of the SPAST gene (604277) in the
proband, her brother, and her 2 sons. Although the proband and her
brother also had a deletion of the ATL1 gene, the ATL1 deletion did not
segregate with the disorder in her sons and had no apparent effect on
the severity of the disorder. The findings suggested that
haploinsufficiency is the pathogenic mechanism for SPG4 (182601),
whereas a dominant-negative effect is the pathogenic mechanism for
SPG3A.

- Hereditary Sensory Neuropathy Type 1D

By genomewide linkage analysis followed by array-based exonic sequencing
of candidate genes, Guelly et al. (2011) identified a heterozygous
mutation in the ATL1 gene (N355K; 606439.0010) as a cause of autosomal
dominant hereditary neuropathy type 1D (HSN1D; 613708) in an affected
family. Screening of this gene in 115 additional probands with a similar
disorder identified 2 additional heterozygous mutations in the ATL1 gene
in 2 unrelated probands (606439.0011 and 606439.0012, respectively). The
phenotype was characterized by adult onset of a distal axonal sensory
neuropathy affecting all modalities, often associated with distal
ulceration and amputation as well as hyporeflexia, although some
patients showed features suggesting upper neuron involvement. In vitro
functional expression studies in COS7 cells did not reveal a common
pathogenetic mechanism, and there was no clear functional distinction
between mutations causing SPG3A and HSN1D, but Guelly et al. (2011)
postulated that a defect in the tubular endoplasmic reticulum may
underlie both disorders.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 3, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
ATL1, ARG239CYS

In affected members of 3 apparently unrelated kindreds with spastic
paraplegia-3 (182600), Zhao et al. (2001) identified a heterozygous
884C-T transition in exon 7 of the ATL1 gene, resulting in an
arg239-to-cys (R239C) substitution.

Abel et al. (2004) identified the R239C mutation in all 22 affected
members of a French family with SPG3 reported by Hazan et al. (1993).
Abel et al. (2004) stated that this was the seventh SPG3 family of
western European descent found to have the R239C mutation. Abel et al.
(2004) reported the nucleotide change as 715C-T, based on numbering from
the translation initiation codon, and noted that position 715 is within
a CpG doublet, suggesting that it is a possible mutation hotspot.

By haplotype analysis of 3 French families with the R239C mutation,
Namekawa et al. (2006) concluded that the mutations arose independently
and were not due to a founder effect. Further analysis confirmed that
the mutation occurred in a hotspot defined by a methylated CpG
dinucleotide.

.0002
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 3, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
ATL1, SER259TYR

In a kindred designated ADHSP-P with early-onset autosomal dominant
spastic paraplegia (182600), Zhao et al. (2001) identified
heterozygosity (both C and A) at nucleotide 945 of the full-length ATL1
cDNA, corresponding to exon 8 of the gene. Unaffected members of the
family had only C at this position. This mutation, TCC (ser) to TAC
(tyr), was predicted to alter amino acid 259. Thus, this mutation,
S259Y, is adjacent to the H258R mutation (606439.0003).

.0003
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 3, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
ATL1, HIS258ARG

Zhao et al. (2001) found that affected members in a kindred with
autosomal dominant hereditary spastic paraplegia of early onset (182600)
were heterozygous (A and G) at nucleotide position 942 of the
full-length cDNA corresponding to the ATL1 gene. Affected members in
this kindred had only C at this position. The mutation was predicted to
result in a his258-to-arg (H258R) amino acid substitution, at a site
adjacent to S259Y (606439.0002).

.0004
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 3, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
ATL1, ARG217GLN

In a large Italian family with early-onset, autosomal dominant
uncomplicated spastic paraplegia (182600), Muglia et al. (2002)
identified an 818G-A mutation in the ATL1 gene, resulting in an
arg217-to-gln substitution in a highly conserved GTPase motif.

.0005
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 3, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
ATL1, 1-BP INS, 1688A

In an Italian family with autosomal dominant hereditary spastic
paraplegia (182600), Tessa et al. (2002) identified a heterozygous 1-bp
insertion, 1688A, in exon 12 of the ATL1 gene, producing a frameshift
and premature stop codon. The resulting protein lacked the last 37 amino
acids, including all of exon 14. Seven clearly affected individuals and
2 asymptomatic individuals with hyperreflexia carried the mutation. The
authors commented on the apparent age-dependent penetrance of the
disorder in this family.

.0006
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 3, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
ATL1, MET408VAL

In a family with 6 members affected with a very early onset severe form
of spastic paraplegia (182600), Dalpozzo et al. (2003) identified a
heterozygous 1222A-G transition in exon 12 of the ATL1 gene, resulting
in a met408-to-val (M408V) substitution. All affected members had onset
in infancy with delayed motor milestones, gait impairment, spastic
paraparesis, distal atrophy, and lower limb weakness. Because of the
very early onset, the first patients were misdiagnosed with cerebral
palsy, and the index patient (mother of 5 affected members) was unaware
that she had a genetically transmissible disease. Two patients had the
unusual sign of mild hand atrophy.

.0007
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 3, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
ATL1, ARG415TRP

In all 3 affected members tested from an Italian family with SPG3A
(182600), D'Amico et al. (2004) identified a heterozygous mutation in
exon 12 of the atlastin gene, resulting in an arg415-to-trp (R415W)
substitution. The mutation was not identified in 400 control
chromosomes. The 3 patients had onset before 5 years of age, and 2
additional family members were reportedly affected by infantile-onset
spastic paraparesis. However, 9 asymptomatic relatives ranging in age
from 13 to 70 years also had the mutation. D'Amico et al. (2004)
concluded that the reduced penetrance of this mutation indicated that
modulator genes or epigenetic factors are involved in the development of
the disease, and they noted the implications for genetic counseling.

Varga et al. (2013) identified a heterozygous c.1243C-T transition in
the ATL1 gene resulting in an R415W substitution in affected members of
a family with SPG3A originally reported by Raggio et al. (1973) as
having a pure spastic paraplegia transmitted in an X-linked pattern of
inheritance. Whole-exome sequencing of 1 of the affected males
identified the heterozygous R415W substitution. This mutation was then
identified in 3 affected family members and in 3 unaffected family
members, consistent with incomplete penetrance. Two of the unaffected
carriers were women, and family history indicated that most unaffected
women were obligate carriers. These findings were consistent with
sex-associated reduced penetrance of this mutation. Varga et al. (2013)
identified the same mutation in 1 of 83 Spanish patients with apparent
sporadic HSP and in 2 of 28 Russian patients with dominant HSP. Evidence
again suggested incomplete penetrance in these families. Varga et al.
(2013) also identified a heterozygous c.1244A-G transition, resulting in
an arg415-to-gln (R415Q; 606439.0014) substitution, in a Moroccan family
with SPG3A and incomplete penetrance. Varga et al. (2013) noted that
both the c.1243C-T and c.1244A-G transitions occur at a CpG nucleotide
(on the plus and minus strands, respectively) and thus may represent a
mutation hotspot due to spontaneous deamination of methylated cytosines.
R415 affects a highly conserved residue that does not localize to a
known protein domain.

.0008
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 3, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
ATL1, LEU157TRP

In a mother and son with SPG3A (182600), Rainier et al. (2006)
identified a heterozygous 638T-C transition in exon 4 of the ATL1 gene,
resulting in a leu157-to-trp (L157W) substitution. The mutation is
predicted to disrupt a putative phosphorylation site of the protein.
Genetic analysis of family members indicated that the mutation occurred
de novo in the mother. The mother was a 34-year-old woman with
uncomplicated nonprogressive spastic paraplegia since infancy who was
originally diagnosed with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy. She was
correctly diagnosed with SPG after her son developed similar clinical
symptoms at age 10 months.

.0009
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 3, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
ATL1, 3-BP DEL

In affected members of a large French Canadian family with SPG3A
(182600), Meijer et al. (2007) identified a heterozygous 3-bp in-frame
deletion in the ATL1 gene, resulting in a deletion of asn436 (436delN).
Functional expression studies showed decreased ATL1 protein levels in
patients' lymphoblasts but normal levels of mRNA, normal GTPase
activity, and normal protein interactions. Meijer et al. (2007)
postulated decreased protein stability and a dominant-negative
loss-of-function mechanism.

.0010
NEUROPATHY, HEREDITARY SENSORY, TYPE ID
ATL1, ASN355LYS

In affected members of a large 4-generation family with autosomal
dominant hereditary sensory neuropathy type ID (HSN1D; 613708), Guelly
et al. (2011) identified a heterozygous 1065C-A transversion in exon 11
of the ATL1 gene, resulting in an asn355-to-lys (N355K) substitution.
The mutation was not found in 370 controls. The phenotype was
characterized by early adult onset of a severe distal st sensory axonal
neuropathy with frequent ulcerations and amputation digits. In vitro
functional expression studies in COS7 cells showed that the mutant
protein had decreased GTPase activity compared to wildtype, and caused
disruption of endoplasmic reticulum 3-way junctions.

.0011
NEUROPATHY, HEREDITARY SENSORY, TYPE ID
ATL1, GLU66GLN

In a 61-year-old man with hereditary sensory neuropathy-1D (HSN1D;
613708), Guelly et al. (2011) identified a heterozygous 196G-C
transversion in exon 2 of the ATL1 gene, resulting in a glu66-to-gln
(E66Q) substitution. He presented with progressive, ascending, severe
sensory loss affecting all modalities in the lower legs, but no foot
ulcerations or paresis. He had hyporeflexia, and sural nerve biopsy
revealed a severe, chronic, axonal neuropathy with a moderate
demyelinating component. The patient's deceased mother reportedly had a
similar severe sensory neuropathy. The mutation was not found in 150
control individuals, but in vitro functional expression studies showed
no change in GTPase activity and no changes in endoplasmic reticulum
morphology.

.0012
NEUROPATHY, HEREDITARY SENSORY, TYPE ID
ATL1, 1-BP DEL, 976G

In a man with hereditary sensory neuropathy-1D (HSN1D; 613708), Guelly
et al. (2011) identified a heterozygous 1-bp deletion (976delG) in exon
9 of the ATL1 gene, resulting in premature termination in the C
terminus. The patient had adult-onset sensory neuropathy with
ulcerations, lack of pain perception, paresthesias in the fingers, and
occasional lancinating pains in his ankles. Patellar tendon reflexes
were brisk, and Achilles tendon reflexes were absent. His father and
brother were similarly affected. The mutation was not found in 334
control individuals. In vitro functional expression studies showed
decreased expression of the truncated protein and diffuse localization
throughout the cytoplasm instead of proper localization to the
endoplasmic reticulum.

.0013
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 3, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
ATL1, ARG416CYS

In affected members of a 3-generation South African Zulu family with
autosomal dominant SPG3A (182600), Orlacchio et al. (2011) identified a
heterozygous 1246C-T transition in exon 12 of the ATL1 gene, resulting
in an arg416-to-cys (R416C) substitution. The mutation was not found in
400 controls. The phenotype in this family was unusual in that affected
individuals had late onset (range 38 to 56 years), mild mental
retardation (IQ 32 to 67), and thin corpus callosum without cerebellar
involvement or white matter abnormalities. Spasticity was restricted to
the lower limbs; 3 patients had sphincter disturbances.

.0014
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 3, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
ATL1, ARG415GLN

In 4 Moroccan sibs with SPG3A (182600), Varga et al. (2013) identified a
c.1244A-G transition in the ATL1 gene, resulting in an arg415-to-gln
(R415Q) substitution. Three sibs were homozygous and 1 was heterozygous
for the mutation. Heterozygosity for the mutation was then found in 3
unaffected family members and in 2 family members who had very subtle
signs of the disorder (hyperreflexia). These findings suggested complete
penetrance for the mutation in homozygous state and incomplete
penetrance for the mutation in heterozygous state. Varga et al. (2013)
also identified a heterozygous c.1243C-T transition, resulting in an
R415W (606439.0007) substitution in another family with SPG3A and
incomplete penetrance. Varga et al. (2013) noted that both the c.1243C-T
and c.1244A-G transitions occur at a CpG nucleotide (on the plus and
minus strands, respectively) and thus may represent a mutation hotspot
due to spontaneous deamination of methylated cytosines. R415 is a highly
conserved residue that does not localize to a known protein domain.

612465	TITLE *612465 TBC1 DOMAIN FAMILY, MEMBER 4; TBC1D4
;;AKT SUBSTRATE, 160-KD; AS160;;
KIAA0603
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned TBC1D4, which they designated
KIAA0603. The deduced 1,299-amino acid protein shares significant
similarity with mouse Tbc1 (TBC1D1; 609850), suggesting a role in cell
signaling and communication. RT-PCR analysis detected TBC1D4 expression
in all tissues examined, with highest levels in kidney, skeletal muscle,
ovary, and heart.

Matsumoto et al. (2004) reported that the TBC1D4 protein contains 2
N-terminal phosphotyrosine interaction domains and a C-terminal TBC
domain. The region containing the TBC domain shares 31% homology with
human RAB GTPase-activating protein-1 (RABGAP1). A C-terminal region
containing most of the TBC domain of TBC1D4 was predicted to have a
tertiary structure similar to the GTPase-activating site structure of
yeast Gyp1, suggesting that arg973 is essential to the GTPase-activating
site of TBC1D4. Northern blot analysis detected a 6-kb transcript in
several tissues, with highest expression in heart and skeletal muscle. A
5-kb transcript was also observed in placenta and several immune
tissues, including spleen, lymph node, and leukocyte.

Using Northern blot analysis, Kurihara et al. (2002) showed that mouse
Tbc1d4 was expressed at low levels at embryonic days 7 and 11, but that
expression increased at embryonic days 15 and 17. In adult mice, Tbc1d4
was detected at variable levels in all tissues examined, with highest
expression in heart.

GENE FUNCTION

Using differential display analysis and RT-PCR, Matsumoto et al. (2004)
found that TBC1D4 was upregulated in peripheral blood CD3 (see
186740)-positive cells from atopic dermatitis (AD; see 603165) patients
compared with normal control cells. Expression was highest in
CD3-positive cells from patients with moderate pathology. Among
leukocyte subsets from 5 healthy subjects, TBC1D4 expression was highest
in T cells, particularly CD4 (186940)-positive/CD45RO (151460)-positive
memory T cells. TBC1D4 expression was transiently upregulated following
in vitro stimulation of T cells with anti-CD3 antibodies or calcium
mobilization.

In muscle and fat cells, insulin (INS; 176730) stimulation activates a
signaling cascade that causes intracellular vesicles containing glucose
transporter-4 (GLUT4, or SLC2A4; 138190) to translocate to and fuse with
the plasma membrane. Using mass spectrometry, Larance et al. (2005)
identified AS160, insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP, or LNPEP;
151300), Rab10 (612672), Rab11 (see RAB11A; 605570), and Rab14 (612673)
on Glut4 vesicles from cultured mouse adipocytes. Association of As160
with Glut4 vesicles was mediated in part by direct interaction with the
cytosolic tail of membrane-bound Irap. The As160-Irap interaction was
insulin dependent, and As160 dissociated from Glut4 vesicles with
insulin exposure. Knockdown of As160 expression via small interfering
RNA led to increased levels of Glut4 at the plasma membrane in the basal
state.

Miinea et al. (2005) stated that phosphorylation of AS160 in adipocytes
by AKT (see AKT1; 164730) is required for insulin-stimulated
translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane. They found that the
purified recombinant GTPase-activating protein (GAP) domain of human
AS160 showed GAP activity with RAB2A (RAB2; 179509), RAB8A (165040),
RAB10, and RAB14, but not with 14 other RABs. Immunoblot analysis showed
that these RABs associated with Glut4-positive vesicles in mouse
adipocytes. Mutation of arg673 to leu inactivated AS160. Miinea et al.
(2005) concluded that AK160 functions as a RAB GAP and that RABs may
participate in GLUT4 translocation.

Karlsson et al. (2005) found that expression of AS160 protein was
similar in muscle biopsy samples from 9 control subjects and from 10
patients with type-2 diabetes (125853). However, phosphorylation of
AS160 in response to physiologic hyperinsulinemia was reduced 39% (p
less than 0.05) in diabetic samples compared with controls. Impaired
AS160 phosphorylation with diabetes was related to aberrant AKT
signaling. Phosphorylation on thr308 of AKT was impaired 51% (p less
than 0.05) in type-2 diabetic samples compared with controls, whereas
phosphorylation on ser473 of AKT was not significantly reduced. Karlsson
et al. (2005) concluded that physiologic hyperinsulinemia increases
AS160 phosphorylation in normal human skeletal muscle, and they
suggested that defects in insulin action on AS160 may impair GLUT4
trafficking in type-2 diabetes.

Bouzakri et al. (2008) found that human and mouse pancreatic beta cells
expressed AS160 and that AS160 was phosphorylated after glucose
stimulation. AS160 mRNA expression was downregulated in pancreatic
islets from individuals with type-2 diabetes. In mouse insulin-secreting
cells, glucose induced phosphorylation of Akt and As160, and this was
mediated by insulin receptor (INSR; 147670), Irs2 (600797), and PI3
kinase (see 601232) independently of changes in cytosolic Ca(2+).
Knockdown of AS160 in mouse cells increased basal insulin secretion, but
it abolished glucose-stimulated insulin release. As160 knockdown also
increased apoptosis and loss of glucose-induced proliferation. Bouzakri
et al. (2008) concluded that AS160 is a major effector of insulin
signaling in pancreatic beta cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kurihara et al. (2002) determined that the 5-prime ends of the mouse and
human TBC1D4 genes contain a conserved CpG island.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the TBC1D4
gene to chromosome 13. By genomic sequence analysis, Kurihara et al.
(2002) mapped the TBC1D4 gene to chromosome 13q22. They mapped the mouse
Tbc1d4 gene to a syntenic region of chromosome 14.

615365	TITLE *615365 ADENYLATE KINASE 8; AK8
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Adenylate kinases (AKs; EC 2.7.4.3), such as AK8, are
phosphotransferases that catalyze the interconversion of nucleoside
phosphates. AKs maintain high levels of ATP in a combined action with
mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, are required for DNA and RNA
synthesis, and may contribute to the activity of medicinal nucleoside
and nucleotide analogs (summary by Panayiotou et al., 2011).

CLONING

Panayiotou et al. (2011) cloned and characterized human AK8. The deduced
protein has 2 AK domains that span residues 59 to 257 and 270 to 470.
Fluorescence-tagged AK8 localized to the cytosol of transfected HeLa
cells. In vitro-translated AK8 had an apparent molecular mass of about
53 kD by SDS-PAGE.

GENE FUNCTION

Panayiotou et al. (2011) found that in vitro-translated AK7 (615364) and
AK8 showed highest affinity for AMP as substrate with ATP as the
phosphate donor. Both also recognized dAMP, CMP, and dCMP as substrates.
Both showed a higher affinity for AMP than the major cytosolic adenylate
kinase, AK1 (103000), but they had a much lower maximal catalytic rate
than AK1. The isolated AK domains of AK8 showed similar substrate
specificity.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the AK8 gene to chromosome 9q34.13 based on an
alignment of the AK8 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK057266) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

610576	TITLE *610576 RHO GTPase-ACTIVATING PROTEIN 9; ARHGAP9
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the RHO (see ARHA; 165390) family of small GTPases are
involved in multiple signaling processes, and they are active in their
GTP-bound form and inactive in their GDP-bound form. RHO GAPs, such as
ARHGAP9, inactivate RHO GTPases by stimulating their intrinsic GTPase
activity (Furukawa et al., 2001).

CLONING

By screening a human thymus cDNA library, followed by 5-prime RACE,
Furukawa et al. (2001) cloned ARHGAP9. The deduced 731-amino acid
protein contains an N-terminal SH3 domain, followed by a WW domain, a
pleckstrin homology domain, and a C-terminal GAP domain. Northern blot
analysis detected a 2.6-kb transcript in peripheral blood, spleen, and
thymus only. By phylogenetic analysis, Peck et al. (2002) determined
that the GAP domain of ARHGAP9 is most closely related to the GAP domain
of ARHGAP12 (610577).

Using RT-PCR, Takefuji et al. (2010) detected strong expression of
ARHGAP9 in T cells and monocytes, with much weaker expression in human
aortic smooth muscle cells; the product was barely detected in human
umbilical vein and human coronary artery endothelial cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Furukawa et al. (2001) determined that the ARHGAP9 gene contains 18
exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Peck et al. (2002) mapped the ARHGAP9 gene
to chromosome 12q14.

GENE FUNCTION

In vitro, Furukawa et al. (2001) demonstrated that recombinant ARHGAP9
showed substantial GAP activity toward CDC42 (116952) and RAC1 (602048),
and less toward ARHA. Exogenous ARHGAP9 expression repressed the
adhesion of a human leukemia cell line to fibronectin (135600) and
collagen IV (see COL4A1; 120130). Furukawa et al. (2001) concluded that
ARHGAP9 regulates the adhesion of hematopoietic cells to extracellular
matrix.

Takefuji et al. (2010) performed a Boyden chamber assay and found that
ARHGAP9 negatively regulates cell migration. Transfection studies in
COS-7 cells demonstrated that ARHGAP9 reduced the activity of RAC1
(602048) and RAC2 (602049).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

See 610576.0001 for discussion of a possible association between
variation in the ARHGAP9 gene and susceptibility to coronary artery
spasm.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RECLASSIFIED - VARIANT OF UNKOWN SIGNIFICANCE
ARHGAP9, ALA370SER (dbSNP rs11544238)

This variant, formerly titled CORONARY ARTERY SPASM 3, SUSCEPTIBILITY
TO, has been reclassified because its contribution to the phenotype has
not been confirmed.

Takefuji et al. (2010) analyzed 67 missense SNPs in Rho-family GTPases
and their regulators in 103 unrelated Japanese individuals with
acetylcholine-induced coronary artery spasm and 102 Japanese controls
without acetylcholine-induced coronary artery spasm. They found a
significant association between coronary artery spasm and a C-A
transversion (dbSNP rs11544238) in the ARHGAP9 gene, resulting in an
ala370-to-ser (A370S) substitution in the PH domain (odds ratio, 2.67).
Boyden chamber assay demonstrated that the ser370 mutant had a weaker
inhibitory effect on cell migration, spreading, and adhesion than
wildtype protein. Takefuji et al. (2010) suggested that ARHGAP9
variation has a critical function in the infiltration of hematopoietic
cells into the endothelium and inflammation leading to endothelial
dysfunction.

605358	TITLE *605358 GENERAL TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR IIA, 1-LIKE; GTF2A1L
;;TFIIA-ALPHA/BETA-LIKE FACTOR; ALF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Synthesis of eukaryotic mRNA requires the assembly of RNA polymerase II
and various general transcription factors, such as the TFIIA subunits
alpha/beta (GTF2A1; 600520) and gamma (GTF2A2; 600519), which interact
with the TATA-binding protein (TBP; 600075) and a separate 4-helix
bundle positioned just upstream of the TBP-TATA complex. ALF is a germ
cell-specific transcription factor with a domain structure similar to
GTF2A1 (Upadhyaya et al., 1999).

CLONING

By searching databases for genes similar to GTF2A1, followed by 5-prime
RACE of a testis cDNA library, Upadhyaya et al. (1999) cloned ALF. The
478-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 53 kD. In
comparison with the organization of GTF2A1, ALF has conserved regions I
and IV and acidic region III, but it has a distinct region II. Northern
and dot blot analyses showed strong testis-restricted expression of a
1.8-kb ALF transcript, which differed from the widespread expression of
GTF2A1 and GTF2A2. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed a 69-kD ALF protein.
Upadhyaya et al. (1999) suggested that the difference between the
calculated and observed molecular masses may be due to the effect of
charged region III.

Han et al. (2001) cloned mouse Alf. The mouse protein shares highest
similarity with human ALF in regions I and IV. Northern blot analysis of
mouse and rat tissues detected expression only in testis. Expression was
first detected in mouse testis at postnatal day 14. Sedimentation
analysis and in situ hybridization showed that Alf was expressed in
pachytene spermatocytes and haploid spermatids.

In the process of cloning ALF, Upadhyaya et al. (1999) also cloned a
longer transcript, SALF, containing most of the ALF sequence at its
3-prime end. Han et al. (2001) determined that SALF is a chimeric
transcript that contains exons 1 through 3 of STON1 (605357) spliced to
exons 2 through 9 of ALF. See 605357 for further information on SALF.

GENE FUNCTION

Using gel shift analysis, Upadhyaya et al. (1999) demonstrated that,
like GTF2A1, ALF, in conjunction with GTF2A2 and TBP, bound DNA.
Functional analysis showed that ALF, together with GTF2A2, allowed mRNA
transcription.

Upadhyaya et al. (2002) found that mammalian ALF was able to stabilize
the binding of TBP to DNA, but it could not stabilize several TBP
mutants. Phosphorylation of ALF with casein kinase II (see CSNK2A1;
115440) resulted in partial restoration of complex formation using
mutant TBPs. Studies of ALF-TBP complexes formed on the adenovirus major
late promoter revealed protection of the TATA box and upstream sequences
from -38 to -20 on the top strand and -40 to -22 on the bottom strand.
The presence of ALF or TFIIA did not significantly alter the ability of
TBP to bind TATA elements from several testis specific genes. Analysis
of the distinct, nonhomologous internal regions II of ALF and GTF2A1
using circular dichroism spectroscopy suggested that these domains are
unordered. Upadhyaya et al. (2002) concluded that the role of ALF in the
assembly and stabilization of initiation complexes in germ cells is
likely to be similar or identical to the role of TFIIA in somatic cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Han et al. (2001) determined that the ALF gene contains 9 exons.

MAPPING

By PCR of a panel of human-rodent chromosomal hybrids and genomic
sequence analysis, Han et al. (2001) mapped the GTF2A1L gene to
chromosome 2p.

from 14 overlapping cosmids from the 500-kb MLS critical region in
Xp22.3. Using exon connection followed by cDNA library screening, they
identified a 2.4-kb contig of cDNA clones spanning 170 kb of genomic
sequence in the MLS deletion region. Northern analysis of this cDNA
detected a prominent transcript of approximately 4.2 kb and a less
abundant transcript of approximately 6 kb in all tissues examined, with
additional transcripts in skeletal muscle. Sequence analysis revealed a
coding region of 601 amino acids contained in 12 exons, with a splice
variant isoform of 495 amino acids. The predicted protein sequence of
the gene, symbolized ARHGAP6, contains homology to the GTPase-activating
(GAP) domain of the Rho-GAP family of proteins (e.g., 300023), which has
been implicated in the regulation of actin polymerization at the plasma
membrane in several cellular processes. Schaefer et al. (1997) discussed
reasons for thinking that a defect in the Rho pathway may play a role in
the pathogenesis of MLS syndrome.

GENE STRUCTURE

Iwase et al. (2007) determined that AMELX (300391) resides in intron 1
of ARHGAP6 in the opposite orientation.

GENE FUNCTION

Prakash et al. (2000) investigated the function of ARHGAP6 by generating
Arhgap6-null mice and also by in vitro expression studies. Surprisingly,
loss of the rhoGAP function of Arhgap6 did not cause any detectable
phenotypic or behavioral abnormalities in the mutant mice. Transfected
mammalian cells expressing ARHGAP6 lost their actin stress fibers,
retracted from the growth surface, and extended thin, branching
processes resembling filopodia. The ARHGAP6 protein colocalized with
actin filaments through an N-terminal domain and recruited filamentous
actin into the growing processes. Mutation of a conserved arginine
residue in the rhoGAP domain prevented the loss of stress fibers but had
little effect on process outgrowth. The authors concluded that ARHGAP6
has 2 independent functions: one as a GAP with specificity for RhoA and
the other as a cytoskeletal protein that promotes actin remodeling.

To determine which Arhgap6 promoters were used during enamel formation,
Hu et al. (2012) isolated mRNA from ameloblasts and enamel organ
epithelia (EOE) of mouse first molars at the secretory (day 5) and
maturation (day 12) stages. No Arhgap6 expression from promoters 1a and
1c was detected in secretory stage ameloblasts or EOE or maturation
stage ameloblasts. Trace expression was detected from these promoters in
maturation state EOE. Arhgap6 expression from promoter 1b was low, but
detectable, in secretory stage ameloblasts and EOE and was noticeably
stronger in maturation stage ameloblasts and EOE. Hu et al. (2012)
concluded that in developing mouse molars, Arhgap6 is expressed almost
exclusively from promoter 1b in developing molars, and predominantly
during the maturation stage.

MAPPING

Schaefer et al. (1997) identified the ARHGAP6 gene within the critical
region defined for the microphthalmia with linear skin defects syndrome
on Xp22.3.

610034	TITLE *610034 VACUOLAR PROTEIN SORTING 33, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF, A; VPS33A
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By PCR of a pancreas cDNA library, Pevsner et al. (1996) obtained a
partial cDNA of human VPS33A. They cloned full-length rat Vps33a, which
encodes a deduced 597-amino acid protein. Northern blot analysis
detected several Vps33a transcripts in all rat tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

- Role of VPS33A in Ebola Virus Infection

Infections by the Ebola and Marburg filoviruses cause a rapidly fatal
hemorrhagic fever in humans for which no approved antivirals are
available. Filovirus entry is mediated by the viral spike glycoprotein
(GP), which attaches viral particles to the cell surface, delivers them
to endosomes, and catalyzes fusion between viral and endosomal
membranes. Additional host factors in the endosomal compartment are
likely required for viral membrane fusion. Using a replication-competent
vesicular stomatitis virus bearing Ebola virus GP (rVSV-GP-EboV) for a
genomewide haploid genetic screen in human cells, followed by selection
of rVSV-GP-EboV-resistant cells, Carette et al. (2011) confirmed a role
for cathepsin B (CTSB; 116810) and identified roles for NPC1 (607623)
and all 6 subunits of the HOPS complex, VPS11 (608549), VPS16 (608550),
VPS18 (608551), VPS33A, VPS39 (612188), and VPS41 (605485), in Ebola
virus entry. Subcloned cells lacking VPS11, VPS33A, or NPC1 displayed
marked resistance to rVSV-GP-EboV or Marburg virus-GP, and
susceptibility could be restored by expression of the corresponding
cDNAs. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that cells lacking
NPC1, VPS11, or VPS33A had an altered distribution of virus within
cells. Carette et al. (2011) concluded that most of the genes involved
in filovirus entry are involved in lysosome function, indicating that
filoviruses exploit this organelle differently than other viruses.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the VPS33A
gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP RH44549).

611279	TITLE *611279 KINESIN FAMILY MEMBER 14; KIF14
;;KIAA0042
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

KIF14 is a member of the kinesin superfamily of microtubule-associated
motors (see 148760) that play important roles in intracellular transport
and cell division (Nakagawa et al., 1997).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated myeloid cell line
cDNA library, Nomura et al. (1994) cloned KIF14, which they designated
KIAA0042. The 1,648-amino acid protein contains an ATP/GTP-binding site
motif. Northern blot analysis of human tissues detected weak expression
in thymus only. The 3-prime untranslated region of the KIF14 mRNA
contains an Alu repeat. Nakagawa et al. (1997) cloned mouse Kif14.
Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues detected Kif14 expression in
brain and kidney.

Carleton et al. (2006) used PCR to amplify the human KIF14 open reading
frame from KIAA0042. The deduced KIF14 protein contains an internal
motor domain with a conserved catalytic core, an N-type conserved neck
region, a forkhead-associated (FHA) domain, and 4 coiled-coil domains.
Immunofluorescence microscopy localized KIF14 throughout the cell cycle
in 293T cells and HeLa cells. During interphase, KIF14 localized to the
cytoplasm and was redistributed to the nucleus upon entry into mitosis.
From prophase to metaphase, KIF14 localized at developing spindle poles
and associated microtubules, and during anaphase, KIF14 accumulated at
the spindle midzone, where it concentrated during telophase. KIF14
localized to the contractile ring in cells ready to undergo abscission.

Using real-time PCR, Corson et al. (2005) found that KIF14 expression
was high in placenta and in fetal tissues, notably liver and thymus, and
very low in the majority of normal adult tissues.

NOMENCLATURE

Lawrence et al. (2004) presented a standardized kinesin nomenclature
based on 14 family designations. Under this system, KIF14 belongs to the
kinesin-3 family.

GENE FUNCTION

Carleton et al. (2006) showed that the KIF14 internal motor domain has
microtubule-dependent ATPase activity. Using microarray profiling of
KIF14 expression in synchronized HCT116 cells, they demonstrated cell
cycle-dependent KIF14 expression that increased in mitotic cells through
G2/M. RNAi knockdown of KIF14 showed several distinct phenotypes with
hypoploidy observed at less than 50% KIF14 mRNA depletion and a
hyperploid (tetraploid and polyploid) phenotype detected in cells with
80% or greater KIF14 mRNA depletion. KIF14-silenced cells demonstrated a
reduction in the concentration of KIF14 at the midbody of late-stage
mitotic cells and inability of these cells to complete cytokinesis.
Carleton et al. (2006) concluded that depletion of KIF14 disrupted cell
cycle progression and induced cytokinesis failure.

Gruneberg et al. (2006) showed that KIF14 copurified in a complex with
PRC1 (603484), KIF4 (300521), MKLP1 (KIF23; 605064), and MKLP2 (KIF20A;
605664). KIF14 localization to the central spindle and midbody was
dependent upon the presence of PRC1, and the N-terminal amino acids 1 to
356, containing the central spindle-targeting signal, were responsible
for binding to PRC1. Using siRNA knockdown of KIF14 mRNA, they
demonstrated that KIF14-depleted cells showed loss of specific
localization of citron kinase (STK21; 605629) to the central spindle and
cleavage furrow region. Immunoprecipitation studies showed citron kinase
interaction with PRC1 and KIF14 specifically but not with other mitotic
kinases. Further studies in cells cotransfected with KIF14 and citron
kinase showed that the C-terminal amino acids 901 to 1649 of KIF14
specifically interacted with the kinase-dead form of citron kinase.

Gain of chromosome 1q31-q32 is seen in over 50% of retinoblastomas and
is common in other tumors. Corson et al. (2005) found that, of the most
frequently gained sequence-tagged sites at 1q32.1, only KIF14 was
overexpressed in various cancers by real-time RT-PCR. KIF14 mRNA was
expressed in 20 of 22 retinoblastomas at levels 100- to 1,000-fold
higher than normal retina, and 10 retinoblastoma cell lines had higher
KIF14 levels than 12 tumors. Relative to normal tissues and cells, KIF14
was overexpressed in the majority of breast cancer and medulloblastoma
cell lines, and primary lung tumors. Patients with lung tumors that
overexpressed KIF14 showed a trend toward decreased survival.

MAPPING

Using a somatic cell hybrid panel, Nomura et al. (1994) mapped the KIF14
gene to chromosome 1. Gruneberg et al. (2006) noted that KIF14 maps to
chromosome 1q31-q32.

Corson et al. (2005) stated that mouse Kif14 maps to a region of
chromosome 1E4 that shares homology of synteny to human chromosome 1q31.

137162	TITLE *137162 GAMMA-AMINOBUTYRIC ACID RECEPTOR, RHO-2; GABRR2
;;GABA-C RECEPTOR, RHO-2 SUBUNIT
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

GABRR2 is a member of a family of ligand-gated chloride channels that
are the major inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the central
nervous system (Cutting et al., 1992).

CLONING

By screening a genomic DNA library with a portion of the cDNA encoding
the GABA receptor subunit rho-1 (GABRR1; 137161), Cutting et al. (1992)
identified 2 distinct clones. One clone contained a single exon from the
rho-1 gene, while the second encompassed an exon with 96% identity to
the rho-1 gene. Screening of a human retina cDNA library with
oligonucleotides specific for the exon in the second clone identified a
3-kb cDNA with an open reading frame of 1,395 bp. The predicted amino
acid sequence demonstrated 30 to 38% similarity to alpha, beta, gamma,
and delta GABA receptor subunits and 74% similarity to the GABA rho-1
subunit, suggesting that the newly isolated cDNA encodes a new member of
the rho subunit family, tentatively named GABA rho-2.

MAPPING

By polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of rho-1 and rho-2 gene
sequences from DNA of 3 somatic cell hybrid panels, Cutting et al.
(1992) mapped both genes to human chromosome 6, bands q14-q21. Tight
linkage was also demonstrated between restriction fragment length
variants (RFLVs) from each rho gene and the Tsha locus on mouse
chromosome 4, which is homologous to the CGA locus (118850) on human
chromosome 6q12-q21.

602730	TITLE *602730 ACTIVIN A RECEPTOR, TYPE IIB; ACVR2B
;;ACTRIIB
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Activins are gonadal polypeptide hormones that are potent stimulators of
FSH secretion and release in vitro (see 147380). Activins are dimers of
2 beta subunits that share extensive sequence homology with transforming
growth factor-beta (190180). There are 2 classes of activin receptors,
type I and type II (see ACVR2; 102581). By RT-PCR with primers based on
the sequences of rodent type II activin receptor genes, Hilden et al.
(1994) cloned an ACVR2B cDNA from the K562 erythroleukemic cell line.
The predicted 512-amino acid protein, which they called ActRIIB, was 99%
identical to the mouse homolog and 69% identical to ACVR2. ACVR2B
contains an extracellular ligand binding domain, a transmembrane domain,
and an intracellular serine/threonine kinase domain. Northern blot
analysis of fetal tissues revealed that ACVR2B mRNAs are variably
expressed in several tissues, with the highest level of expression in
brain. On Northern blots of K562 cell mRNA, Hilden et al. (1994) found
that ACVR2B was expressed predominantly as 2.5- and 10-kb transcripts,
with a very weak signal at 2.1 kb.

GENE FUNCTION

Lee et al. (2005) showed that ligands such as myostatin (MSTN; 601788)
signal through mouse Acvr2 and Acvr2b to regulate muscle growth in vivo.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ishikawa et al. (1998) reported that the ACVR2B gene contains 11 exons
and spans approximately 30 kb.

Kosaki et al. (1999) reported the intron-exon organization of the human
ACVR2B gene and compared their findings with those of Ishikawa et al.
(1998).

MAPPING

By its inclusion within a contig and fluorescence in situ hybridization,
Ishikawa et al. (1998) mapped the ACVR2B gene to 3p22-p21.3. By FISH,
Bondestam et al. (1999) mapped the ACVR2B gene to 3p22.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In patients with left-right axis malformations (613751), Kosaki et al.
(1999) identified heterozygous mutations in the ACVR2B gene
(602730.0001-602730.0002).

Burdine and Schier (2000) reviewed convergent and divergent mechanisms
in left-right axis formation in chick, mouse, frog, and zebrafish and
the role of mutations in EBAF (601877), ACVR2B, ZIC3 (300265), and
connexin-43 (121014) in humans.

ANIMAL MODEL

Oh and Li (1997) found that targeted disruption of the mouse Acvr2b gene
results in abnormal left-right (LR) axis development in Acvr2b -/-
homozygotes. Resulting malformations include atrial and ventricular
septal defects, right-sided morphology of the left atrium and left lung,
and spleen hypoplasia.

Lin et al. (1999) generated homozygous knockout mice for the Pitx2
(601542) gene by targeted disruption. The cardiac and pulmonary
phenotype of these mice was indistinguishable from those of Acvr2b
knockout mice, indicating that Pitx2 is the critical downstream target
of Acvr2b, a putative Nodal (601265) receptor.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HETEROTAXY, VISCERAL, 4, AUTOSOMAL
ACVR2B, ARG40HIS

In 2 unrelated patients with left-right axis malformations (613751),
Kosaki et al. (1999) found a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 119 in exon
2 of the ACVR2B gene resulting in an arg40-to-his amino acid
substitution. One of the patients had ventricular inversion
(dextrocardia), but intact ventricular septum and normally related great
arteries. The patient also had a right aortic arch and a right-sided
spleen, as well as anomalies of the inferior and the superior vena cava.
The second patient had a complete atrial ventricular canal defect with
dextro-transposed great arteries and obstruction to pulmonary outflow.
Pulmonary venous return was normal, but like the first patient, there
was an interrupted inferior vena cava with azygous continuation. This
patient also had polysplenia and midline liver. The mutation was not
found in 100 randomly selected control individuals.

.0002
HETEROTAXY, VISCERAL, 4, AUTOSOMAL
ACVR2B, VAL494ILE

In a patient with left-right axis malformations (613751), Kosaki et al.
(1999) found a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 1480 in exon 11 of the
ACVR2B gene resulting in a val494-to-ile amino acid substitution of the
protein product. The patient had ventricular inversion with ventricular
septal defect, inversion and transposition of the great vessels,
pulmonary stenosis, total anomalous pulmonary venous return, and midline
liver. The mutation was not found in 100 randomly selected control
individuals.

;;FYN TYROSINE KINASE PROTOONCOGENE;;
SRC-LIKE KINASE; SLK;;
SYN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening a genomic library with a YES1 (164880) gene probe, Semba et
al. (1986) identified a related gene, which they called SYN
(src/yes-related novel gene). Northern blot analysis revealed that the
2.8-kb SYN mRNA was expressed in various cell types. The tyrosine kinase
domain of the predicted 537-amino acid SYN protein is 77 to 80%
identical to those of the YES1, FGR (164940), and chicken SRC (190090)
tyrosine kinase oncogenes. Therefore, Semba et al. (1986) concluded that
SYN is a new member of the tyrosine kinase oncogene family.

GENE FUNCTION

PrPc, the cellular, nonpathogenic isoform of prion protein (Prp;
176640), is a ubiquitous glycoprotein expressed strongly in neurons.
Mouillet-Richard et al. (2000) used the murine 1C11 neuronal
differentiation model to search for PrPc-dependent signal transduction
through antibody-mediated crosslinking. The 1C11 clone is a committed
neuroectodermal progenitor with an epithelial morphology that lacks
neuron-associated functions. Upon induction, 1C11 cells develop a
neural-like morphology, and may differentiate either into serotonergic
or noradrenergic cells. The choice between the 2 differentiation
pathways depends on the set of inducers used. Ligation of PrPc with
specific antibodies induced a marked decrease in the phosphorylation
level of the tyrosine kinase FYN in both serotonergic and noradrenergic
cells. The coupling of PrPc to FYN was dependent upon caveolin-1
(601047). Mouillet-Richard et al. (2000) suggested that clathrin (see
118960) might also contribute to this coupling. The ability of the 1C11
cell line to trigger PrPc-dependent FYN activation was restricted to its
fully differentiated serotonergic or noradrenergic progenies. Moreover,
the signaling activity of PrPc occurred mainly at neurites.
Mouillet-Richard et al. (2000) suggested that PrPc may be a signal
transduction protein.

Parravicini et al. (2002) noted that Lyn (165120) deficiency impairs
some mast cell functions, but degranulation and cytokine production are
intact. In Gab2 (606203)-deficient mice, on the other hand,
degranulation and cytokine production are impaired. Using immunoblot
analysis, they showed that although Lyn is essential for Syk (600085)
activation and Lat (602354) phosphorylation after Fcer1 (see FCER1G;
147139) aggregation, neither Lyn nor Lat are necessary for Gab2
phosphorylation. RT-PCR and coimmunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated
abundant Fyn expression in mast cells and an association with Gab2. In
cells lacking Fyn, neither Gab2 nor Akt (164730) were phosphorylated.
Functional analysis showed that Lyn -/- mast cells exhibited
hyperdegranulation and enhanced PI3K (see 601232) activity and Akt
phosphorylation, whereas in Fyn -/- mast cells the degranulation
response was inhibited. The inhibition was associated with decreased
binding of PI3K with Gab2. Parravicini et al. (2002) observed that the
degranulation response was independent of Fcer1 stimulation in
Fyn-deficient mast cells and that degranulation was dependent on PI3K in
wildtype and mutant cell lines. The degranulation response was dependent
on a rise in intracellular calcium that was inhibited in Lyn-deficient
mast cells but intact in Fyn-deficient cells. Degranulation proceeded in
Lyn -/- cells due to increased activation and constitutive
phosphorylation of the calcium-independent protein kinase C delta
isoform (PRKCD; 176977). Parravicini et al. (2002) concluded that Fyn-
and Lyn-initiated pathways synergize in late events at the level of
protein kinase C and calcium, respectively, to regulate mast cell
degranulation.

Using yeast 2-hybrid, immunoblot, and structural analyses, Chan et al.
(2003) showed that the SH2 domain of SAP (SH2D1A; 300490) bound to the
SH3 domain of FYN in a noncanonical manner and directly coupled FYN to
SLAM (SLAMF1; 603492).

Netrin-1 (601614) plays a role in the developing nervous system by
promoting both axonal outgrowth and axonal guidance in pathfinding. Liu
et al. (2004), Li et al. (2004), and Ren et al. (2004) simultaneously
reported a complex network of intracellular signaling downstream from
netrin-1 involving DCC (120470), focal adhesion kinase (FAK; 600758),
and FYN. In neurons cultured from rat cerebral cortex, Liu et al. (2004)
found that netrin-1 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and FYN, and
coimmunoprecipitation studies showed direct interaction of FAK and FYN
with DCC. Inhibition of FYN inhibited FAK phosphorylation, and FYN
mutants inhibited the attractive turning responses to netrin. Neurons
lacking the FAK gene showed reduced axonal outgrowth and attractive
turning responses to netrin. In cultured neurons from chick and mouse,
Li et al. (2004) found that netrin increased tyrosine phosphorylation of
DCC and FAK. Coimmunoprecipitation studies showed that DCC interacted
directly with FAK and SRC to form a complex and that FAK and SRC
cooperated to stimulate DCC phosphorylation by SRC. Li et al. (2004)
suggested that phosphorylated DCC acts as a kinase-coupled receptor and
that FAK and SRC act downstream of DCC in netrin signaling. Ren et al.
(2004) found that inhibition of FAK phosphorylation inhibited
netrin-1-induced axonal outgrowth and guidance. The authors suggested
that FAK may also function as a scaffolding protein and play a role in
cytoskeletal reorganization that is necessary for neurite outgrowth and
turning.

MAPPING

Semba et al. (1986) assigned the SYN gene to chromosome 6 by analysis of
somatic cell hybrids. Popescu et al. (1987) mapped the FYN gene to 6q21
by use of in situ hybridization. Boyle et al. (1992) confirmed the
assignment to the proximal part of 6q21 by study of a panel of 13 hybrid
cell lines containing various fragments of chromosome 6. Using a single
interspecific backcross, Justice et al. (1990) demonstrated the location
of the Fyn gene in relation to other genes on mouse chromosome 10.

ANIMAL MODEL

Grant et al. (1992) found that mice homozygous for a fyn null mutation
had impaired long-term potentiation and spatial learning. Yagi et al.
(1993) generated fyn-deficient mice by inserting the lacZ gene into the
fyn gene. Homozygous mutant mice appeared normal. However, the
homozygous fyn mutant neonates from homozygous fyn mutant parents died
because of a suckling problem. The mutant neonates suckled normally when
the fyn mutant mothers' mammary glands had been activated by suckling of
a heterozygous or wildtype pup. In homozygous mutant pups, the modified
glomerular complex of the olfactory bulb, thought to be involved in
pheromone perception, was abnormally shaped and reduced in size and the
hippocampal cell-layer was undulated. Since suckling is mediated by
pheromones, Yagi et al. (1993) speculated that the suckling problem
might be due to altered pheromone sensitivity. Yagi et al. (1993) noted
that Grant et al. (1992) did not observe a suckling defect in fyn mutant
mice. Yagi et al. (1993) suggested that this might be due to the fact
that the mice with a suckling defect had an insertional mutation in fyn,
while Grant et al. (1992) were studying mice with a null allele.

Cain et al. (1995) studied electrical kindling in mice containing a null
mutation in the fyn tyrosine kinase gene. Electrical kindling is
achieved by applying brief low intensity electrical stimuli over a
period of days to the brain, resulting in an electrical seizure focus
that may persist for months to years. The fyn mutants showed a striking
retardation in the rate of kindling, even though the phenomenon crucial
for kindling (i.e., the threshold duration and stability of epileptiform
after discharges) were normal. This implied to the authors that function
of the fyn gene is required for normal epileptogenesis.

SYK controls pre-B cell development but does not affect NFKB (164011)
induction. Saijo et al. (2003) showed that mice triple-deficient in the
Src family protein tyrosine kinases (SFKs) Blk (191305), Fyn, and Lyn,
but not single-deficient or Syk-deficient mice, had impaired Nfkb
induction and B-cell development. The impairment of Nfkb induction could
be overcome by protein kinase C-lambda (see 176982) activation. Saijo et
al. (2003) suggested that there are 2 separate pathways in pre-B cell
receptor signaling, one SFK-dependent and the other SYK-dependent, that
contribute critically to pre-B cell development.

606467	TITLE *606467 ALDEHYDE DEHYDROGENASE 8 FAMILY, MEMBER A1; ALDH8A1
;;ALDH12
DESCRIPTION Retinal dehydrogenase isozymes (e.g., RALDH1; 100640) are members of the
ALDH family. Short-chain alcohol dehydrogenases convert all-trans- and
9-cis-retinol to all-trans- and 9-cis-retinal, while RALDH isozymes
convert these into all-trans-retinoic acid and 9-cis-retinoic acid,
respectively.

CLONING

By biochemical purification of rat kidney and liver Raldh isozymes,
micropeptide sequencing, and genomic database analysis, followed by
5-prime and 3-prime RACE and PCR of a human kidney cDNA library, Lin and
Napoli (2000) isolated a cDNA encoding ALDH8A1, which they termed
ALDH12. Sequence analysis predicted that the 487-amino acid ALDH8A1
protein contains the 23 invariant residues and 4 conserved regions
typical of the ALDH superfamily. It also has a cofactor-binding motif
and a cys residue that serves as an active-site nucleophile. Northern
blot analysis revealed expression of a 2.5-kb ALDH8A1 transcript only in
liver and kidney. Dot-blot analysis detected low expression in brain and
spinal cord and detectable expression in mammary gland, thymus, adrenal,
testis, prostate, and parts of the gastrointestinal tract. Functional
analysis showed increased RALDH activity of ALDH8A1, with greater
efficiency for 9-cis-retinal, from pH7 to pH9 in vitro and in intact
cells in the presence of type-1 cis-retinol androgen dehydrogenase
(CRAD1). Lin and Napoli (2000) also identified an ALDH8A1 splice variant
missing 1 exon and encoding a 433-amino acid protein that lacks 2 of the
invariant residues, including the active-site nucleophile.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the ALDH8A1
gene to chromosome 6 (TMAP sts-N70701).

600423	TITLE *600423 ENDOTHELIN-CONVERTING ENZYME 1; ECE1
;;ECE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Endothelin-converting enzyme-1 is involved in the proteolytic processing
of endothelin-1 (EDN1; 131240), -2 (EDN2; 131241), and -3 (EDN3; 131242)
to biologically active peptides.

CLONING

Schmidt et al. (1994) purified a membrane-bound protease activity from
bovine endothelial cells that specifically converts the inactive form to
EDN1. The enzyme was cleaved with trypsin and peptide sequencing
analysis confirmed it to be a zinc-chelating metalloprotease containing
the typical HEXXH (HELTH) motif. RT-PCR and cDNA screens were used to
isolate the complete cDNAs of the bovine and human enzymes.

A splice variant of the same cDNA was identified by Shimada et al.
(1995) from an umbilical vein endothelial cell library. The authors
expressed the protein in COS-1 cells and could detect it in membrane
fractions from expressing cells. Yorimitsu et al. (1995) also obtained a
human ECE cDNA by screening an ACHN human renal adenocarcinoma library.
That cDNA, referred to as AECE, encoded a predicted 770-codon open
reading frame which is was different at the amino end from the Shimada
et al. (1995) sequence but close to the Schmidt et al. (1994) sequence.
The rat ECE and human AECE amino acid sequences were over 96% alike.

GENE STRUCTURE

The ECE1 gene consists of 20 exons and spans over 120 kb (Valdenaire et
al., 1999; Funke-Kaiser et al., 2000).

Valdenaire et al. (1995) found that the precursors of the ECE1 a and b
isoform mRNAs are transcribed from 2 distinct start sites, upstream from
exon 1 and exon 3, respectively. Sequence analysis of the 2 putative
promoters revealed the presence of motifs characteristic for several
transcription factors. The authors stated that comparison of the ECE
gene structure with those of other zinc metalloproteinases, as well as a
phylogenetic study, confirmed the existence of a metalloprotease
subfamily composed of ECE1, ECE2 (610145), neutral endopeptidase
(120520), Kell blood group protein (613883), and 2 bacterial enzymes.

GENE FUNCTION

Maggi et al. (2000) demonstrated that in FNC-B4 cells, which are derived
from a human fetal olfactory epithelium, both sex steroids and odorants
regulate GnRH secretion. They found biologic activity of EDN1 in this
GnRH-secreting neuronal cell. In situ hybridization and
immunohistochemistry revealed gene and protein expression of EDN1 and
ECE1 in both fetal olfactory mucosa and FNC-B4 cells. Experiments with
radiolabeled EDN1 and EDN3 strongly indicated the presence of 2 classes
of binding sites, corresponding to the ETA (16,500 sites/cell) and the
ETB receptors (8,700 sites/cell). Functional studies using selective
analogs indicated that these 2 classes of receptors subserve distinct
functions in human GnRH-secreting cells. The ETA receptor subtype
mediated an increase in intracellular calcium and GnRH secretion.

MAPPING

Valdenaire et al. (1995) mapped the ECE1 gene to chromosome 1p36 by
isotopic in situ hybridization.

By Southern blot analysis of human genomic DNA from human/mouse somatic
cell hybrids, Matsuoka et al. (1996) demonstrated that ECE1 maps to
chromosome 1. By fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), they refined
the localization to 1p36.1. By FISH, Albertin et al. (1996) mapped ECE1
to 1p36 and confirmed the localization to chromosome 1 by analysis of
monochromosomal hybrids. Radiation hybrid mapping localized the gene
tentatively at the border between 1p36.3 and 1p36.2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Hirschsprung Disease, Cardiac Defects, and Autonomic Dysfunction

Hofstra et al. (1999) described involvement of the ECE1 gene in a
patient with skip-lesions Hirschsprung disease, cardiac defects, and
autonomic dysfunction (613870). By screening all 19 exons of the gene,
using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis followed by sequencing,
they identified a heterozygous C-to-T transition, resulting in the
substitution of cysteine for arginine at position 742 (R742C;
600423.0001).

- Essential Hypertension

Funke-Kaiser et al. (2003) proposed that ECE1 is a candidate gene for
human blood pressure regulation and identified 5 polymorphisms in ECE1
among a cohort of 704 European hypertensive patients. Transient
transfection of the reporter constructs containing the -338A allele
(600423.0002) showed an increase in promoter activity compared with the
wildtype promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed the
specific binding of E2F2 (600426), a transcription factor, to both ECE1b
promoter sequences, with the -338A allele being associated with an
increased affinity to E2F2 compared with -338C. In 100 untreated
hypertensive women, both the -338A and -839G (600423.0003) alleles were
significantly associated with ambulatory blood pressure values. The
authors proposed a link between the cell cycle-associated E2F family and
blood pressure regulation via a component of the endothelin system.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yanagisawa et al. (1998) and Clouthier et al. (1998) showed that mice
deficient in either endothelin receptor type A (EDNRA; 131243) or ECE1
develop defects in a subset of cephalic and cardiac neural crest
derivatives. Ednra-null mice show defects in craniofacial structures,
great vessels, and cardiac outflow tract. Ece1-null mice exhibit a
virtually identical phenotype to Ednra-deficient and
endothelin-1-deficient embryos due to the absence of biologically active
endothelin-1. Ece1-deficient mice lack enteric neurons and
epidermal/choroidal melanocytes, reproducing the phenotype of Edn3
(131242) and Ednra knockout mice. Yanagisawa et al. (1998) elaborated on
the role of the Edn1/Ednra pathway in the patterning of the aortic arch
in mice.

Eckman et al. (2003) found that Ece1 +/- mice had significantly elevated
concentrations of both beta-amyloid-40 and beta-amyloid-42 (see APP;
104760) in their brains compared with littermate controls.

Choi et al. (2006) found that doubly transgenic mice expressing an
Alzheimer disease (104300)-associated APP mutation and overexpressing
PRKCE (176975) had decreased amyloid plaques, plaque-associated neuritic
dystrophy, and reactive astrocytosis compared to mice only expressing
the APP mutation. There was no evidence for altered APP cleavage in the
doubly transgenic mice; instead, overexpression of PRKCE increased the
activity of Ece1, which degrades beta-amyloid.

Ortmann et al. (2005) found that expression of Ece1 and Ece2 was
increased in nonobese diabetic mice compared with controls.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HIRSCHSPRUNG DISEASE, CARDIAC DEFECTS, AND AUTONOMIC DYSFUNCTION
ECE1, ARG742CYS

Hofstra et al. (1999) identified an arg742-to-cys mutation in the ECE1
gene in a patient with skip-lesions Hirschsprung disease, cardiac
defects, craniofacial abnormalities and other dysmorphic features, and
autonomic dysfunction (613870). The patient's parents were not available
for testing. Amino acid position 742 is in the vicinity of the active
site of ECE1 (Valdenaire et al., 1995). Hofstra et al. (1999) suggested
that the R742C mutation was responsible for, or at least contributed to,
the phenotype of the patient in view of the function of ECE1 during
murine development suggested by mouse models, the overlap in phenotypic
features of these mouse models and those of the patient, and the
functional consequences of the mutation on enzyme activity. The mutation
was thought to lead to the phenotype by resulting in reduced levels of
EDN1 and EDN3.

.0002
HYPERTENSION, ESSENTIAL, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
ECE1, -338C-A

Funke-Kaiser et al. (2003) identified a polymorphism in the 5-prime
flanking region of the ECE1 gene, -338C-A, that was associated with
ambulatory blood pressure values (see 145500). The polymorphism is
located within a putative consensus site for E2F (see 189971) and GATA
(see 601656) proteins. The -338A allele was associated with higher
daytime and nighttime 24-hour systolic and diastolic blood pressure in
nontreated hypertensive women. Transient transfection of the reporter
constructs containing the -338A allele showed an increase in promoter
activity compared with the wildtype promoter. Electrophoretic mobility
shift assays revealed the specific binding of E2F2 (600426), a
transcription factor, to both ECE1b promoter sequences, with the -338A
allele being associated with an increased affinity to E2F2 compared with
-338C.

.0003
HYPERTENSION, ESSENTIAL, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
ECE1, -839T-G

Funke-Kaiser et al. (2003) identified a polymorphism in the 5-prime
flanking region of the ECE1 gene, -839T-G, that was associated with
ambulatory blood pressure values (see 145500).
