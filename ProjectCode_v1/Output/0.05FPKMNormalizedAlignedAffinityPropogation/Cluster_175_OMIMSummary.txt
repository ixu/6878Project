DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The GBA2 gene encodes an enzyme initially identified as a microsomal
beta-glucosidase that catalyzes the hydrolysis of endogenous bile acid
3-O-glucosides (Matern et al., 2001). The enzyme is also a nonlysosomal
glucosylceramidase that catalyzes the conversion of glucosylceramide to
free glucose and ceramide, as well as the reverse reaction consisting in
the transfer of glucose to different lipid substrates. As an enzyme of
sphingolipid metabolism, it plays a role in a variety of cell signaling
responses and in structural components of the plasma membrane (summary
by Martin et al., 2013).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned GBA2, which they designated
KIAA1605. The deduced protein contains 922 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected high GBA2 expression in all adult and fetal tissues examined,
with highest expression in adult heart and brain. High expression was
also detected in all specific adult brain regions examined, with highest
expression in substantia nigra, subthalamic nucleus, thalamus, and
caudate nucleus.

By searching an EST database for sequences encoding peptide fragments
obtained from purified human liver GBA2, followed by PCR and RACE of a
human liver cDNA library, Matern et al. (2001) cloned GBA2. The 5-prime
UTR of the transcript has a high GC content. The deduced protein
contains 927 amino acids and has a calculated molecular mass of 104.6
kD. GBA2 contains a putative membrane-spanning domain and 2 potential
N-glycosylation sites. However, glycosidase treatment indicated that
GBA2 is not a glycoprotein. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.6-kb
transcript in all tissues examined, with highest expression in brain,
heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and placenta. Lower expression was
detected in liver, spleen, small intestine, and lung, and very low
expression was detected in colon, thymus, and peripheral blood
leukocytes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Matern et al. (2001) determined that the GBA2 gene spans about 12 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Matern et al. (2001) mapped the GBA2 gene
to chromosome 9.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 11 patients from 4 unrelated families with autosomal recessive
hereditary spastic paraplegia-46 (SPG46; 614409), Martin et al. (2013)
identified 4 different biallelic mutations in the GBA2 gene
(609471.0001-609471.0004). Three of the mutations were truncating and 1
was a missense mutation that was shown to result in complete loss of
enzyme function. The mutations were found by exome sequencing of the
candidate region identified by linkage analysis. The phenotype was
characterized by early onset of progressive spastic paraparesis,
cerebellar ataxia, mental impairment, cataracts, cerebral, cerebellar
and corpus callosum atrophy, and infertility in males.

In 10 patients from 4 unrelated Tunisian families with autosomal
recessive cerebellar ataxia and spasticity, Hammer et al. (2013)
identified 3 different homozygous mutations in the GBA2 gene
(609471.0005-609471.0007). The first mutations were identified by
homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing. The patients presented with
cerebellar ataxia in the first 2 decades of life and later developed
spasticity and axonal neuropathy. Only 1 patient had mild intellectual
impairment, and only 1 had an abnormal brain MRI.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yildiz et al. (2006) generated Gba2-knockout mice and found that they
had normal bile acid metabolism; however, males exhibited impaired
fertility and had globozoospermia with abnormal acrosomes and defective
mobility. Glucosylceramides accumulated in the testes, brains, and
livers of the Gba2-knockout mice but did not cause obvious neurologic
symptoms, organomegaly, or reduction in life span. In GBA2-transfected
simian COS and human embryonic kidney cells, the authors demonstrated
that GBA2 hydrolyzes glucosylceramide to glucose and ceramide. Yildiz et
al. (2006) concluded that GBA2 is a glucosylceramidase, the loss of
which causes accumulation of glycolipids and an endoplasmic reticulum
storage disease.

Martin et al. (2013) found that morpholino knockout of Gba2 in zebrafish
induced a curly tail phenotype in 12.5% of morphants, but 73.8% had no
visible abnormalities. However, 24% of those that appeared normal showed
significant motility defects compared to control embryos. These defects
were associated with abnormal development of spinal motoneurons and
defects in axonal outgrowth. Some of these defects could be rescued when
coexpressed with wildtype human GBA2.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 46, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
GBA2, ARG630TRP

In affected members of a large consanguineous Tunisian family with
autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia-46 (SPG46; 614409),
Martin et al. (2013) identified a homozygous 1888C-T transition in exon
12 of the GBA2 gene, resulting in an arg630-to-trp (R630W) substitution
at a highly conserved residue in the six-hairpin-glucosidase-like domain
of the enzyme. The mutation, which segregated with the disorder and was
not found in 1,038 control chromosomes or 6,500 control exomes, was
found by sequencing all coding exons in the region on chromosome 9
identified by linkage analysis (Boukhris et al., 2010). Direct
sequencing of the GBA2 gene in 95 probands with autosomal recessive SPG
identified a homozygous R630W substitution in a Portuguese patient with
the disorder whose parents were related. Each unaffected parent was
heterozygous for the mutation. The mutation-carrying haplotypes differed
between the 2 families. Cells from the Portuguese patient showed a
complete lack of GBA2 activity, and in vitro functional expression
studies showed that the mutant enzyme had no GBA2 activity, consistent
with a complete loss of function. Morpholino knockout of the Gba2 gene
in zebrafish resulted in variable curly tail, motility defects, abnormal
development of spinal motoneurons, and defects in axonal outgrowth.
Coexpression of the R630W mutant protein could not rescue these defects,
although wildtype human GBA2 could rescue the defects.

transversion in exon 2 of the GBA2 gene, resulting in a tyr121-to-ter
(Y121X) substitution at a highly conserved residue. The mutation was not
found in 50 Tunisian controls or in 330 additional controls. The

180390	TITLE *180390 RIBONUCLEOTIDE REDUCTASE, M2 SUBUNIT; RRM2
;;RIBONUCLEOTIDE REDUCTASE, SMALL SUBUNIT;;
RIBONUCLEOTIDE REDUCTASE, R2 SUBUNIT; R2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The RRM2 gene encodes the small subunit (R2) of ribonucleotide
reductase, the heterodimeric enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting
step in deoxyribonucleotide synthesis.

CLONING

Pavloff et al. (1992) cloned human RRM1 (180410) and RRM2 cDNAs from a
breast carcinoma cDNA library. The deduced 389-amino acid RRM2 protein
has a molecular mass of 45 kD and is 1 amino acid shorter than the
equivalent mouse protein. The human and mouse RRM2 proteins share 96%
homology in the C terminus, but only 69% in the first 68 residues in the
N terminus.

GENE FUNCTION

In dividing cells, ribonucleotide reductase is essential for the
production of deoxyribonucleotides before DNA synthesis in S phase.
Neither of its 2 subunits, R1 or R2, are detectable in quiescent cells.
In cycling cells, RRM2 mRNA and protein are present throughout the cell
cycle (summary by Parker et al., 1994).

Using a library of endoribonuclease-prepared short interfering RNAs
(esiRNAs), Kittler et al. (2004) identified 37 genes required for cell
division, one of which was RRM2. These 37 genes included several
splicing factors for which knockdown generates mitotic spindle defects.
In addition, a putative nuclear-export terminator was found to speed up
cell proliferation and mitotic progression after knockdown.

MAPPING

Yang-Feng et al. (1986, 1987) carried out chromosomal mapping of RRM2 by
means of a full-length mouse cDNA. By Southern blot analysis of
interspecies somatic cell hybrid lines and by in situ hybridization,
Yang-Feng et al. (1987) found that the 4 chromosomal sites carrying
M2-related sequences are 1p33-p31, 1q21-q23, 2p25-p24, and Xp21-p11. In
the mouse, M2 sequences were found on chromosomes 4, 7, 12, and 13 by
somatic cell hybrid studies. By Southern analysis of human and mouse
hydroxyurea-resistant cells that overproduce M2 due to gene
amplification, Yang-Feng et al. (1987) identified the amplified
restriction fragments as those that map to human chromosome 2 and to
mouse chromosome 12. The sites other than 2p probably represent
pseudogenes, particularly the ones on the X chromosome since active
genes on mammalian X chromosomes are conserved and no RRM2 sequence was
found on the mouse X chromosome. Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC; 165640)
is coamplified with RRM2 in human and rodent hydroxyurea-resistant cell
lines. Using cDNA clones, Yang-Feng et al. (1987) mapped ODC to the same
region of human chromosome 2. In an RRM2 overproducing mouse cell line,
they found amplification of the chromosome 12-specific restriction
fragments. Thus, the functional loci of both RRM2 and ODC are on murine
chromosome 12.

609857	TITLE *609857 DYSTROPHIA MYOTONICA WD REPEAT-CONTAINING PROTEIN; DMWD
;;DMRN9, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; DMRN9
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Shaw et al. (1993) identified the human DMWD gene, which they designated
gene 59, near the DMPK gene (605377) on chromosome 19. They obtained 2
DMWD cDNAs that differed in their 3-prime ends and used alternate
polyadenylation signals. Northern blot analysis of human and baboon RNA
detected a 3-kb transcript. In rat and human tissues, strongest DMWD
expression was in brain, liver, and testis.

Jansen et al. (1995) cloned mouse DMWD, which they called Dmrn9. The
mouse transcripts also have 2 alternative 3-prime ends due to the
presence of 2 inefficient polyadenylation signals. The deduced 650-amino
acid protein contains 2 regions with significant homology to WD repeats.
Northern blot analysis detected highest expression in mouse brain and
testis, with significant expression in heart and lung. In situ
hybridization of mouse embryos detected ubiquitous low expression in all
tissues and enhanced expression in adult brain and testis. Dmwd
expression began before embryonic day 9.5. From day 14.5 onward, Dmwd
mRNA was detected in all neural tissues, especially in the telencephalon
and mesencephalon. Later, expression was evident in distinct tubules of
the mature testis and was restricted to secondary spermatocytes of
stages VIII to XII of the spermatogenic proliferation cycle.

GENE STRUCTURE

Jansen et al. (1995) determined that the DMWD gene contain 5 exons and
spans about 11 kb. The mouse gene has a similar structure.

MAPPING

Jansen et al. (1995) stated that DMWD gene maps about 1 kb upstream of
the DMPK gene on chromosome 19q13.3.

;;XT2;;
UDP-D-XYLOSE:PROTEOGLYCAN CORE PROTEIN BETA-D-XYLOSYLTRANSFERASE 2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

For background information on xylosyltransferases, see XYLT1 (608124).

CLONING

Using degenerate primers based on the sequences of XT1 tryptic peptides,
Gotting et al. (2000) cloned XT2 by PCR and RACE of a placenta cDNA
library. The deduced 865-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of about 97 kD. XT2 has a potential type II transmembrane region, a
proline-rich sequence, and 3 potential N-glycosylation sites. XT2 shares
about 55% amino acid identity with XT1, including stretches that share
more than 80% identity. Alignment of the XT1 and XT2 proteins with Xt1
and Xt2 from rat liver revealed highly conserved sequences in the
central and C-terminal regions of the proteins. RT-PCR detected XT2
expression in all tissues examined, with greatest abundance in kidney
and pancreas.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gotting et al. (2000) determined that the XYLT2 gene contains 11 exons
and spans 15 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Gotting et al. (2000) mapped the XYLT2
gene to chromosome 17q21.3-q22.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

On the basis of the altered proteoglycan metabolism in pseudoxanthoma
elasticum (PXE; 264800), which suggested that enzymes from this pathway
function as a genetic cofactor in the severity of the disorder, Schon et
al. (2006) proposed the XYLT genes XYLT1 (608124) and XYLT2 as candidate
genes for this cofactor role. They screened all exons of these 2 genes
in 65 German PXE patients using denaturing high performance liquid
chromatography and analyzed the influence of variations on clinical
characteristics. They identified 22 variations in the XYLT genes. The
missense mutation ala115 to ser in XYLT1 (608124.0001) was associated
with higher serum XT activity (p = 0.005). The amino acid substitution
thr801 to arg in the XYLT2 gene (608125.0001) occurred with
significantly higher frequency in patients under 30 years of age at
diagnosis; all PXE patients with this variation suffered from skin
lesions compared to only 75% of the wildtype patients. The other
variants in the XYLT2 gene were found to be more frequent in patients
with higher organ involvement.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PSEUDOXANTHOMA ELASTICUM, MODIFIER OF SEVERITY OF
XYLT2, THR801ARG

Schon et al. (2006) found that the amino acid substitution thr801 to arg
(T801R) in XYLT2 occurred with significantly higher frequency in
pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE; 264800) patients under 30 years of age at
diagnosis (43% vs 26%; p = 0.04); all PXE patients with this variation
suffered from skin lesions compared to only 75% of the wildtype patients
(p = 0.002). This variant was also more frequent in patients with organ
involvement (p = 0.02). The amino acid substitution arose from a 2402C-G
transversion in XYLT2 exon 11.

600187	TITLE *600187 EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 5A; EIF5A
;;EIF5A1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The eukaryotic initiation factor 5A is an 18-kD protein composed of 154
amino acids. It contains a unique amino acid residue, hypusine, that is
formed posttranslationally via the transfer and hydroxylation of the
butylamino-group from the polyamine spermidine to a lys50 within the
EIF5A protein. Koettnitz et al. (1994) isolated and characterized the
human EIF5A pseudogene. Subsequently, Koettnitz et al. (1995) identified
a genomic clone encoding a functional EIF5A. The authors showed that
this sequence could successfully complement yeast carrying the HYP2
mutation (the homolog of EIF5A), whereas the pseudogenes could not.

GENE STRUCTURE

Koettnitz et al. (1995) found that the human EIF5A gene contains at
least 4 exons and spans at least 4.8 kb.

GENE FUNCTION

Saini et al. (2009) used molecular genetic and biochemical studies to
show that EIF5A promotes translation elongation. Depletion or
inactivation of EIF5A in the yeast S. cerevisiae resulted in the
accumulation of polysomes and an increase in ribosomal transit times.
Addition of recombinant EIF5A from yeast, but not a derivative lacking
hypusine, enhanced the rate of tripeptide synthesis in vitro. Moreover,
inactivation of EIF5A mimicked the effects of the EEF2 (130610)
inhibitor sordarin, indicating that EIF5A might function together with
EEF2 to promote ribosomal translocation. Because EIF5A is a structural
homolog of the bacterial protein EF-P, Saini et al. (2009) proposed that
EIF5A/EF-P is a universally conserved translation elongation factor.

To identify tumor suppressor genes in lymphoma (605027), Scuoppo et al.
(2012) screened a short hairpin RNA library targeting genes deleted in
human lymphomas and functionally confirmed those in a mouse lymphoma
model. Of the 9 tumor suppressors identified, 8 corresponded to genes
occurring in 3 physically linked 'clusters,' suggesting that the common
occurrence of large chromosomal deletions in human tumors reflects
selective pressure to attenuate multiple genes. Among the newly
identified tumor suppressors were adenosylmethionine decarboxylase-1
(AMD1; 180980) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A),
2 genes associated with hypusine, a unique amino acid produced as a
product of polyamine metabolism through a highly conserved pathway.
Through a secondary screen surveying the impact of all polyamine enzymes
on tumorigenesis, Scuoppo et al. (2012) established the
polyamine-hypusine axis as a new tumor suppressor network regulating
apoptosis. Unexpectedly, heterozygous deletions encompassing AMD1 and
eIF5A often occur together in human lymphomas, and cosuppression of both
genes promotes lymphomagenesis in mice. Thus, Scuoppo et al. (2012)
concluded that some tumor suppressor functions can be disabled through a
2-step process targeting different genes acting in the same pathway.

Translation elongation factor P (EF-P) is critical for virulence in
bacteria. EF-P is present in all bacteria and orthologous to archaeal
and eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (a/eIF5A). Ude et al. (2013)
demonstrated that EF-P is an elongation factor that enhances translation
of polyproline-containing proteins: in the absence of EF-P, ribosomes
stall at polyproline stretches, whereas the presence of EF-P alleviates
the translational stalling. Moreover, Ude et al. (2013) demonstrated the
physiologic relevance of EF-P to fine-tune the expression of the
polyproline-containing pH receptor CadC to levels necessary for an
appropriate stress response. Bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic cells
have hundreds to thousands of polyproline-containing proteins of diverse
function, suggesting that EF-P and a/elF5A are critical for copy number
adjustment of multiple pathways across all kingdoms of life.

Doerfel et al. (2013) showed that EF-P prevents the ribosome from
stalling during synthesis of proteins containing consecutive prolines,
such as PPG, PPP, or longer proline strings, in natural and engineered
model proteins. EF-P promotes peptide-bond formation and stabilizes the
peptidyl-transfer RNA in the catalytic center of the ribosome. EF-P is
posttranslationally modified by a hydroxylated beta-lysine attached to a
lysine residue. The modification enhances the catalytic proficiency of
the factor mainly by increasing its affinity to the ribosome. Doerfel et
al. (2013) proposed that EF-P and its eukaryotic homolog, elF5A, are
essential for the synthesis of a subset of proteins containing proline
stretches in all cells.

MAPPING

Steinkasserer et al. (1995) mapped the EIF5A gene to 17p13-p12 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. Three pseudogenes were mapped to
10q23.3, 17q25, and 19q13.2.

608504	TITLE *608504 RHO GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE EXCHANGE FACTOR 15; ARHGEF15
;;EPHEXIN 5; E5;;
KIAA0915
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Rho GTPase functions as a molecular switch by cycling between an active
GTP-bound form and an inactive GDP-bound form. Guanine nucleotide
exchange factors (GEFs) initiate the exchange of GDP with GTP and
promote the association of Rho with its effector molecules. ARHGEF15
functions as a specific GEF for RHOA (165390) (summary by Ogita et al.,
2003).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned ARHGEF15, which they designated
KIAA0915. The transcript contains a repetitive element in the 3-prime
untranslated region, and the deduced 777-amino acid protein shares 35.9%
identity over 499 amino acids with ARHGEF5 (600888). In descending
order, RT-PCR ELISA detected intermediate to low expression of ARHGEF15
in lung, ovary, heart, liver, kidney, testis, skeletal muscle, and
brain. Little to no expression was detected in pancreas and spleen.

By Western blot analysis, Ogita et al. (2003) determined that rat
Arhgef15 is expressed in the vascular smooth muscle cells of all organs
examined. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated weak staining in rat
cardiomyocytes, but none in other parenchymal cells or blood cells.
ARHGEF15 expression was also detected in human coronary artery smooth
muscle cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Ogita et al. (2003) found that endogenous rat Arhgef15 was
coimmunoprecipitated by anti-Epha4 (602188) antibody in a rat aortic
smooth muscle cell line, and mouse Epha4 immunoprecipitated with human
ARHGEF15 when coexpressed in a human embryonic kidney cell line.
Mutation analysis indicated that the Dbl homology domain and the
pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of ARHGEF15, but not the PH domain
alone, mediated the interaction with Epha4. The authors presented
evidence that ARHGEF15 has a role in RHOA activation and the regulation
of vascular smooth muscle contractility.

Margolis et al. (2010) showed that E5 functioned as a GEF for Rhoa, but
not Rac1 (602048) or Cdc42 (116952), and that it regulated synapse
formation in developing mouse neurons. E5 specifically
coimmunoprecipitated with ephrin receptor Ephb2 (600997). Knockdown and
overexpression studies revealed that binding of E5 to Ephb2 inhibited
formation of excitatory synapses. The E5-Ephb2 interaction was
terminated by the binding of ephrin B (see EFNB1; 300035) to Ephb2.
Activation of Ephb2 by ephrin B resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation,
release, and destabilization of E5, permitting the formation of
excitatory synapses. Degradation of E5 required its binding to the E3
ubiquitin ligase Ube3a (601623), and E5 degradation was inhibited by an
inactive Ube3a mutant or proteasome inhibition. Margolis et al. (2010)
observed that E5 localized to newly formed filopodia prior to synapse
development and appeared to restrict filopodia motility and growth.
Thus,they suggested that E5 might function as an initial barrier to
synapse formation until its degradation following ephrin B-mediated
activation of Ephb2. Margolis et al. (2010) noted that mutations in
UBE3A can cause Angelman syndrome (105830), and they showed that E5
expression was elevated in a mouse model of Angelman syndrome. They
concluded that elevated E5 expression during development may contribute
to abnormal cognitive function in Angelman syndrome.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the ARHGEF15
gene to chromosome 17. Gross (2011) mapped the ARHGEF15 gene to
chromosome 17p13.1 based on an alignment of the ARHGEF15 sequence
(GenBank GENBANK BC036749) and the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

TGT, CATALYTIC SUBUNIT
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT; EC 2.4.2.29) synthesizes queuosine
(Q), which is found in tRNAs that recognize NAU and NAC codons, encoding
tyr, asn, asp, and his. Prokaryotic TGT is a single protein of 43 kD. In
contrast, mammalian TGT appears to be a heterodimer consisting of a
60-kD subunit (USP14; 607274) and a 43-kD catalytic subunit (QTRT1)
(Deshpande and Katze, 2001).

CLONING

By database analysis, Deshpande and Katze (2001) identified the QTRT1
gene, which encodes a 403-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular
mass of 44 kD. It shares significant identity with several bacterial and
eukaryotic homologs.

GENE FUNCTION

Deshpande and Katze (2001) found that transfection of a QTRT1 construct
into a TGT-negative human colon adenocarcinoma line restored the ability
of these cells to form Q-containing tRNA.

GENE STRUCTURE

Deshpande and Katze (2001) determined that the QTRT1 gene contains 10
exons spanning approximately 12 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Deshpande and Katze (2001) mapped the
QTRT1 gene to chromosome 19p13.2.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The 'pallid' mouse mutant represents a platelet storage pool deficiency
(SPD) manifesting with prolonged bleeding time, pigment dilution, and
other features. Huang et al. (1999) described the physical mapping,
positional cloning, and mutational and functional analysis of the gene
that is defective in pallid mice. The gene encodes a ubiquitously
expressed, highly charged 172-amino acid protein, which they called
pallidin, with no homology to known proteins. Huang et al. (1999)
isolated the orthologous gene encoding human pallidin and found that the
predicted protein has 86% amino acid identity with the mouse protein.
The first 60 amino acids give rise to an unstructured protein, followed
by 2 highly alpha-helical coiled-coil regions, essential for palladin
self-binding and binding to syntaxin-13 (see STX12, 606892).

Cullinane et al. (2011) noted that PLDN transcript-1, which they called
PLDN1, contains 172 amino acids and is encoded by exons 1 to 5.
Transcript-2, which they called PLDN2, contains 101 amino acids and is
encoded by exon A, exon 2, and exon B. PCR analysis of adult and fetal
human tissues showed ubiquitous expression of transcript-1 except for
absence in adult and fetal brain. Transcript-2 showed limited expression
in adult brain, testis, and leukocytes, and in fetal lung, brain, and
thymus.

GENE STRUCTURE

Cullinane et al. (2011) determined that the PLDN gene contains 7 exons
with alternative splicing of exons A and B.

MAPPING

Huang (2000) stated that ESTs of the human PLDN gene had been mapped to
chromosome 15q15 by radiation hybrid mapping.

By ancestral chromosome mapping, Huang et al. (1999) localized the mouse
pallidin gene to chromosome 2E. The pallidin gene is closely linked to
mouse Epb42 (171070) and B2m (109700), 68 cM from the centromere.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen, Huang et al. (1999) discovered that
pallidin interacts with syntaxin-13 (see STX12, 606892), a t-SNARE
protein that mediates vesicle docking and fusion. Huang et al. (1999)
confirmed this interaction by coimmunoprecipitation assay.
Immunofluorescence studies corroborated that the cellular distribution
of pallidin overlaps that of syntaxin-13.

By coimmunoprecipitation and immunodepletion experiments of mouse skin
fibroblasts, Falcon-Perez et al. (2002) identified pallidin as a
component of BLOC1 (biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex-1;
see 601444), which also contains 'muted' (607289). A yeast 2-hybrid
screen found no direct interaction between muted and pallidin, but
pallidin was found to interact with itself. Residues that include 2
putative coiled-coil domains of human pallidin were necessary and
sufficient for self-assembly. Falcon-Perez et al. (2002) also determined
that pallidin/BLOC1 could interact with actin filaments in vitro and in
transfected cells.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Cullinane et al. (2011) analyzed the exonic regions of all 8 BLOC1
subunit-encoding genes in 38 patients with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome
(HPS)-like symptoms, who were negative for mutations in genes associated
with HPS1 through HPS6 (see 203300), and identified homozygosity for a
nonsense mutation in exon 3 of the PLDN gene in 1 patient (Q78X;
604310.0001). Noting that exon 3 is present only in the PLDN1
transcript, Cullinane et al. (2011) demonstrated that expression of the
PLDN2 transcript was not upregulated as a compensatory mechanism in the
patient's cells, suggesting that PLDN1 and PLDN2 have different
promoters and different functions within cells.

In a 17-year-old Italian girl with an HPS-like primary immunodeficiency
syndrome, Badolato et al. (2012) performed whole-exome sequencing and
identified homozygosity for the Q78X mutation in the PLDN gene; no
mutations were found in other immunodeficiency-associated genes.

ANIMAL MODEL

'Pallid' is 1 of 13 platelet SPD mouse mutants. Pallid (pa) animals
suffer from prolonged bleeding time, pigment dilution, kidney lysosomal
enzyme elevation, serum alpha-1-antitrypsin activity deficiency
(613490), and abnormal otolith formation. As with other mouse mutants of
this class, characterization of pallid mice suggested a defect in
organelle biosynthesis. Huang et al. (1999) detected a nonsense mutation
at codon 69 of this gene in the pallid mutant. Whereas the 'mocha'
(607246) and 'pearl' (603401) SPD mutants have defects in Ap3, the
findings of Huang et al. (1999) suggested that pallid SPD mutants are
defective in a more downstream event of vesicle trafficking, namely
vesicle docking and fusion. Huang et al. (1999) stated that pallid was
the fifth SPD mutant to be described at the molecular level. These
mutants are characterized by abnormalities in platelet-dense granules,
melanosomes, and lysosomes, and in each case, the predicted protein is
involved in organelle biogenesis.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HERMANSKY-PUDLAK SYNDROME 9
BLOC1S6, GLN78TER

In a 9-month-old boy of Indian ancestry with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome-9
(HPS9; 614171), Cullinane et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for a
232C-T transition in exon 3 of the PLDN gene, resulting in a
gln78-to-ter (Q78X) substitution, which would abolish a SC35 binding
site and is predicted to result in loss of exon 3 and a frameshift.
Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of PLDN transcript-1 showed normal mRNA
expression in patient fibroblasts and melanocytes; however, immunoblot
analysis showed that full-length palladin protein was absent from
patient cells. PCR analysis of patient fibroblast and melanocyte cDNA
did detect a faint lower band of PLDN, consistent with an alternative
transcript skipping exon 3. Cullinane et al. (2011) demonstrated that
even if the mutant transcript is translated into protein, although it
correctly localizes to early endosomes, it does not interact with
syntaxin-13 (see 606892). In patient melanocytes, the melanogenic
protein TYRP1 (115501) showed aberrant localization, an increase in
plasma-membrane trafficking, and a failure to reach melanosomes, thus
explaining the boy's severe albinism and establishing the diagnosis of
HPS9.

In a 17-year-old Italian girl with an HPS-like primary immunodeficiency
syndrome, Badolato et al. (2012) performed whole-exome sequencing and
identified homozygosity for the Q78X mutation in the PLDN gene. Sanger
sequencing confirmed the mutation, which was present in heterozygosity
in her unaffected parents but was not found in approximately 250 control
exomes or in the NHLBI exome collection. An increased proportion of both
resting and IL2 (147680)-activated NK cells from the patient expressed
CD107A (LAMP1; 153330) on the surface compared to controls, and patient
NK cells also showed moderately increased cell surface expression of
CD63 (155740). In addition, IL2-activated NK cells from the patient had
decreased granulation, and both resting and activated NK cells showed
reduced cytolytic activity compared to controls.

;;CYCLIC GMP-AMP SYNTHASE; CGAS;;
CHROMOSOME 6 OPEN READING FRAME 150; C6ORF150
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MB21D1 is a type I interferon (e.g., IFNA1; 147660)-stimulated gene
(ISG) that encodes a protein with broad antiviral activity (Schoggins et
al., 2011).

CLONING

Schoggins et al. (2011) stated that MB21D1 is a putative
nucleotidyltransferase that contains an MAB21 domain.

GENE FUNCTION

Using an overexpression screening approach to test more than 380 ISGs,
including MB21D1, for their ability to inhibit replication of various
human and animal viruses, including hepatitis C virus (see 609532),
yellow fever virus, West Nile virus (see 610379), chikungunya virus,
Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, and human immunodeficiency virus-1
(see 609423), Schoggins et al. (2011) found that MB21D1 had broad
antiviral activity. Further analysis suggested that inhibition of
primary viral translation is the mechanism of MB21D1 antiviral activity.

Cytosolic DNA induces interferons through the production of cyclic
guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic GMP-AMP, or
cGAMP), which binds to and activates the adaptor protein STING (612374).
Through biochemical fractionation and quantitative mass spectrometry,
Sun et al. (2013) identified a cGAMP synthase, cGAS, which belongs to
the nucleotidyltransferase family. Overexpression of cGAS activated the
transcription factor IRF3 (603734) and induced interferon-beta (147640)
in a STING-dependent manner. Knockdown of cGAS inhibited IRF3 activation
and interferon-beta induction by DNA transfection or DNA virus
infection. cGAS bound to DNA in the cytoplasm and catalyzed cGAMP
synthesis. Sun et al. (2013) concluded that cGAS is a cytosolic DNA
sensor that induces interferons by producing the second messenger cGAMP.

Wu et al. (2013) found that mammalian cytosolic extracts synthesized
cGAMP in vitro from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and guanosine
triphosphate (GTP) in the presence of DNA but not RNA. DNA transfection
or DNA virus infection of mammalian cells also triggered cGAMP
production. cGAMP bound to STING, leading to the activation of IRF3 and
induction of interferon-beta. Thus, Wu et al. (2013) concluded that
cGAMP is present in metazoans and functions as an endogenous second
messenger that triggers interferon production in response to cytosolic
DNA.

MAPPING

Gross (2011) mapped the MB21D1 gene to chromosome 6q13 based on an
alignment of the MB21D1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC108714) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Daheron et al. (2001) cloned mouse Ian4 from a myeloid precursor cell
line. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.1-kb transcript in myeloid
cells. Cell fractionation and immunocytochemical analysis revealed
mitochondrial localization. A truncation mutant lacking the C-terminal
20 amino acids localized diffusely throughout the cytoplasm.

By searching a sequence database using IMAP1 (608084) as probe, Stamm et
al. (2002) identified IAN4L1, which they called IMAP3. The deduced
307-amino acid protein contains 5 motifs conserved in GTP-binding
proteins and a putative C-terminal transmembrane region. IAN4L1 shares
46% identity with IMAP1. Phylogenetic analysis showed that IAN4L1 is
homologous to mouse Ian4.

By Western blot and confocal microscopy analyses, Keita et al. (2007)
found that rat Gimap5 was expressed as a 35-kD protein in T lymphocytes,
but not other mononuclear cells, in a sedimentable subcellular
compartment distinct from mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. Gimap5
did not colocalize with Bcl2 (151430).

GENE STRUCTURE

Stamm et al. (2002) determined that the IAN4L1 gene contains 3 exons.
Exon 1 is untranslated, and exon 3 contains more than 94% of the coding
sequence.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Stamm et al. (2002) mapped the IAN4L1 gene
to a 100-kb IMAP gene cluster on chromosome 7q32-q36. Within this
cluster, IMAP1 is located on the negative strand, while IMAP2 (608085),
IMAP3, and IMAP4 (608087) are on the opposite positive strand.

By interspecific backcross mapping, Daheron et al. (2001) mapped the
mouse Ian4 gene to the central region of chromosome 6.

ANIMAL MODEL

Biobreeding diabetes-prone (BBDP) rats homozygous for a frameshift
mutation in the Gimap5 gene, termed the lyp mutation, exhibit
spontaneous apoptosis of T lymphocytes, resulting in marked lymphopenia
and development of autoimmune type I diabetes (see 222100). Using flow
cytometry, Keita et al. (2007) found that T cells from lyp/lyp rats
showed loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. They proposed that
GIMAP5 regulates T-lymphocyte survival by mechanisms operating upstream
of mitochondria.

Barnes et al. (2010) identified a chemically induced recessive mutation,
which they called sphinx, in the mouse Gimap5 gene. Homozygous sphinx
mice, like Gimap5 -/- mice, were lymphopenic, showed granulocyte
accumulation, exhibited liver abnormalities, and died by age 14 weeks.
Further analysis of sphinx mice suggested that Gimap5 has cell-intrinsic
roles in lymphocyte survival, quiescence, and antigen receptor-induced
proliferation. Early morbidity of sphinx mice appeared to be due to
antibiotic-suppressible, microflora-dependent intestinal inflammation
and wasting disease. Barnes et al. (2010) proposed that GIMAP5 is a key
regulator of hematopoietic integrity and lymphocyte homeostasis.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The rho GTPase (see Ridley and Hall, 1992) is involved in a signaling
pathway that regulates cell adhesion and cytokinesis, among other
activities. Watanabe et al. (1996) used the yeast 2-hybrid system to
identify cDNAs that interact with rho. One clone was isolated from a
mouse embryo cDNA library. A full-length sequence derived from several
clones encodes a predicted 643-amino acid protein that they named
rhophilin. Northern blots showed a 3.2-kb RNA was expressed at highest
amounts in the testis. Watanabe et al. (1996) found that a region at the
amino terminus of rhophilin shares sequence similarity with PKN (601032)
and is the site for rho binding.

604744	TITLE *604744 DIMETHYLARGININE DIMETHYLAMINOHYDROLASE 2; DDAH2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH; EC 3.5.3.18) regulates
cellular methylarginine concentrations, which in turn inhibit nitric
oxide synthase (see 163731) activity.

CLONING

Leiper et al. (1999) isolated a cDNA encoding DDAHI (604743) and, by
screening a database of translated open reading frames with the deduced
DDAHI peptide sequence, identified DDAHII. Both DDAHI and DDAHII cDNAs
encode 285-amino acid proteins. The DDAHII amino acid sequence shares
98% identity with that of its mouse homolog and 62% identity with the
sequence of DDAHI. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.0-kb DDAHII
transcript expressed at highest levels in heart, kidney, and placenta.

By RNA dot blot analysis, Tran et al. (2000) determined that DDAH2
expression predominates in more highly vascularized tissues and in
immune tissues, while DDAH1 expression predominates in tissues that also
express the neuronal isoform of NOS (163731).

GENE FUNCTION

Leiper et al. (1999) expressed a histidine-tagged DDAHII clone in E.
coli and assayed the cell lysate for DDAH activity. Recombinant DDAHII
metabolized ADMA and L-NMMA, but not SDMA or L-arginine, demonstrating
that DDAHII is a functional homolog of DDAHI.

By overexpression in human and murine endothelial cells, Smith et al.
(2003) determined that DDAH2 reduced the secretion of ADMA, increased
VEGF mRNA expression, and enhanced tube formation by cells grown in a
3-dimensional medium. A DDAH inhibitor reduced tube formation in human
umbilical vein endothelial cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Genomic sequence analysis by Tran et al. (2000) indicated that DDAH2
contains 8 exons with 3 transcription start sites that generate
alternatively spliced transcripts.

MAPPING

Tran et al. (2000) mapped the DDAH2 gene to 6p21.3 by radiation hybrid
and FISH analysis.

600284	TITLE *600284 ELONGATION FACTOR RNA POLYMERASE II; ELL
;;ELEVEN NINETEEN LYSINE-RICH LEUKEMIA GENE
DESCRIPTION Thirman et al. (1994) cloned the gene that fuses to MLL (159555) in
patients with acute myeloid leukemia associated with the translocation
t(11;19)(q23;p13.1). This translocation is distinct from another type of
11;19 translocation with a 19p13.3 breakpoint that results in the fusion
of MLL to the ENL gene (159556). By PCR screening of a cDNA library
prepared from a patient's leukemia cells with this translocation,
Thirman et al. (1994) obtained a fusion transcript containing exon 7 of
MLL and sequence of an unknown gene. The sequence of this gene was
amplified and used as a probe to screen a fetal brain cDNA library. On
Northern blot analysis, this cDNA detected a 4.4-kb transcript that was
abundant in peripheral blood leukocytes, skeletal muscle, placenta, and
testis and expressed at lower levels in spleen, thymus, heart, brain,
lung, kidney, liver, and ovary. In addition, a 2.8-kb transcript was
present in peripheral blood, testis, and placenta. On zoo blots, this
gene was shown to be evolutionarily conserved in 10 mammalian species,
as well as in chicken, frog, and fish. They named the gene ELL (for
'eleven-nineteen lysine-rich leukemia' gene). A highly basic,
lysine-rich motif of the predicted ELL protein was homologous to similar
regions of several proteins, including the DNA-binding domain of
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (173870).

ELL was shown by Shilatifard et al. (1996) to encode an elongation
factor that can increase the catalytic rate of RNA polymerase II
transcription by suppressing transient pausing by the polymerase at
multiple sites along the DNA. The authors noted that ELL is the second
elongation factor to be implicated in oncogenesis (elongin (see 600786),
which is a transcription factor regulated by the product of the von
Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene (608537), was the first), and
they stated that these findings provide further support for a close
connection between the regulation of transcription and cell growth.

In studies of the transforming properties of the MLL-ELL fusion gene,
Lavau et al. (2000) retrovirally transduced primary murine hematopoietic
progenitors and assessed their growth properties both in vitro and in
vivo. MLL-ELL increased the proliferation of myeloid colony-forming
cells in methylcellulose cultures upon serial replating, whereas
overexpression of ELL alone had no effect. Reconstitution of lethally
irradiated congenic mice with bone marrow progenitors transduced with
MLL-ELL resulted in the development of monoclonal or pauciclonal acute
myeloid leukemias within 100 to 200 days. The leukemic cells were
readily transplantable to secondary recipients and could be established
as immortalized cell lines in liquid cultures.

608303	TITLE *608303 LEUCINE-RICH GENE, GLIOMA-INACTIVATED, 4; LGI4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to LGI1 (604619),
followed by RT-PCR, Gu et al. (2002) cloned LGI4. The deduced 538-amino
acid protein contains an N-terminal signal peptide, a putative
transmembrane region, and 1 partial and 4 complete leucine-rich repeats
(LRRs). The LRRs are flanked on both sides by cysteine-rich regions, and
the N-terminal cysteine-rich region contains a motif conserved in LGIs.
LGI4 shares significant similarity with LGI1, LGI2 (608301), and LGI3
(608302). Semiquantitative PCR detected LGI4 expression in all tissues
examined, with highest expression in brain.

By in situ hybridization of adult mouse brain, Senechal et al. (2005)
showed that Lgi4 was expressed at high levels in the rostral migratory
stream and the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellar cortex. Lgi4 was
secreted in transfected 293T cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy
localized Lgi4 to discrete intracellular compartments, consistent with
its presence in ER, Golgi bodies, and vesicles.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gu et al. (2002) determined that the LGI4 gene contains 9 exons

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis and radiation hybrid analysis, Gu et al.
(2002) mapped the LGI4 gene to chromosome 19q13.11. They mapped the
mouse Lgi4 gene to chromosome 7.

103195	TITLE *103195 PERILIPIN 2; PLIN2
;;ADIPOSE DIFFERENTIATION-RELATED PROTEIN; ADRP;;
ADIPOPHILIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the perilipin family, such as PLIN2, coat intracellular lipid
storage droplets (Heid et al., 1998).

CLONING

Through biochemical analysis of milk lipid globule membranes (MLGMs),
followed by database analysis and PCR, Heid et al. (1998) isolated cDNAs
encoding human PLIN2, which they called adipophilin or ADRP. The deduced
437-amino acid human protein shares approximately 84% identity with the
425-amino acid mouse protein. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis showed
expression of a 52-kD protein in human and other mammalian cell lines.
Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a 1.8-kb transcript in all
human cell lines tested. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated
cytoplasmic punctate staining in human and other mammalian cell lines
and in secretory acinar cells in lactating human mammary gland tissue.
Heid et al. (1998) proposed that adipophilin may be a marker for
differentiated cells containing lipid droplets.

GENE FUNCTION

Heid et al. (1996) reported that Adrp served as a substrate for protein
kinases associated with cow MLGMs in vitro. However, Adrp did not appear
to be phosphorylated intracellularly.

By confocal microscopy of skeletal muscle fibers from 6 lean male
cyclists, Shaw et al. (2009) demonstrated that ADRP colocalized
primarily with intramyocellular lipids (IMCLs) in areas between the
mitochondrial network. They concluded that the majority of, but not all,
IMCLs contain adipophilin.

- Role in Leprosy Pathogenesis

Mycobacterium leprae survives and replicates within lipid droplets
stored in the enlarged phagosomes of histiocytes, a typical feature of
lepromatous leprosy (see 609888) thought to be an important nutrient
source for the bacillus. Using immunohistochemistry, Tanigawa et al.
(2008) demonstrated that ADRP and PLIN1 (170290) localized to the
enlarged phagosomes of macrophages in lepromatous leprosy lesions. ADRP
expression was induced in a monocyte cell line when live, but not dead,
M. leprae was added. M. leprae could also inhibit the normal suppression
of ADRP and PLIN1 expression mediated by peptidoglycan, a TLR2 (603028)
ligand. Tanigawa et al. (2008) proposed that M. leprae can actively
induce and support ADRP/PLIN1 expression to facilitate intraphagosomal
lipid accumulation and a suitable environment for survival within
macrophages.

Independently, Mattos et al. (2010) demonstrated the presence of ADRP in
foamy macrophages of lepromatous leprosy patients and in human monocytes
and mouse macrophages. In addition, lipid bodies containing ADRP were
taken up from infected cells by neighboring uninfected macrophages in a
partially TLR2- and TLR6 (605403)-dependent manner. Flow cytometric
analysis indicated a correlation between lipid body formation and
prostaglandin E2 production. Mattos et al. (2010) concluded that M.
leprae-induced lipid bodies are intracellular sites for eicosanoid
synthesis and proposed that foamy cells may be critical in subverting
the immune response in lepromatous leprosy.

GENE STRUCTURE

Eisinger and Serrero (1993) isolated and characterized the mouse Plin2
gene, which spans 14 kb and contains 8 exons.

MAPPING

Gross (2010) mapped the PLIN2 gene to chromosome 9p22.1 based on an
alignment of the PLIN2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF443203) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

Eisinger and Serrero (1993) mapped the mouse Plin2 gene to chromosome 4.

602618	TITLE *602618 C-TERMINAL-BINDING PROTEIN 1; CTBP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The E1a region of group C adenoviruses encodes 2 nearly identical
proteins that are largely responsible for the oncogenic properties of
adenoviruses. Whereas the N-terminal half of these E1A proteins is
sufficient for transformation, the C-terminal half appears to modulate
transformation, tumorigenesis, and metastasis negatively. Boyd et al.
(1993) purified a HeLa cell protein, designated CTBP1, that specifically
binds to the C-terminal half of E1A proteins. CTBP1 is a phosphoprotein
that migrates as a 48-kD doublet by SDS-PAGE. Katsanis and Fisher (1998)
suggested that the doublet consists of CTBP1 and the closely related
CTBP2 (602619).

Schaeper et al. (1995) independently isolated a CTBP1 cDNA from a B-cell
library. The predicted 439-amino acid sequence contains the sequences of
2 peptides prepared from purified CTBP1. The authors
coimmunoprecipitated CTPB1 and an E1A protein from extracts of mammalian
cells that were expressing both proteins.

Furusawa et al. (1999) identified the mouse homologs of CTBP1 and CTBP2
in a yeast 2-hybrid screen for proteins that interact with delta-EF1
(TCF8; 189909), a transcriptional repressor that binds the E2-box
(CACCTG) and related sequences. Using 2-hybrid and direct binding
assays, they concluded that CtBP1 binds to the short medial portion of
delta-EF1 containing the PLDLSL motif. In cotransfection experiments,
they observed that CtBP1 enhanced the transrepression activity of
delta-EF1. Using Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization with
mouse embryos, Furusawa et al. (1999) detected CtBP1 expression
throughout developmental stages and in a wide range of adult tissues.
CtBP1 and CtBP2 expression correlates with delta-EF1 expression. The
authors hypothesized that CtBP1 and CtBP2 function as corepressors of
delta-EF1 action.

GENE FUNCTION

Polycomb (Pc) is part of a Pc group (PcG) protein complex that is
involved in repression of gene activity during Drosophila and vertebrate
development. Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay, Sewalt et al. (1999) found
that Xenopus Ctbp1 interacts with Xenopus Pc and that human CTBP2
interacts with PC2 (603079), a human Pc homolog. Immunofluorescence
studies indicated that CTBP1 and CTBP2 partially colocalize with PC2 in
large PcG domains in interphase nuclei. As with PC2, chimeric LexA-CTBP2
and LexA-CTBP1 proteins repressed gene activity when targeted to a
reporter gene. Sewalt et al. (1999) suggested that PC2-mediated
repression of gene expression involves an association with corepressors
such as the CTBPs. They speculated that the interference of the
adenoviral E1A protein with the transcription machinery of the infected
cell may involve interference with PcG-mediated repression through
disruption of the CTBP-PcG interaction. Northern blot analysis revealed
that the CTBP1 gene was expressed as a 2.4-kb mRNA in all human tissues
tested.

Pc2 recruits the transcriptional corepressor CTBP to PcG bodies. Kagey
et al. (2003) showed that CTBP is sumoylated at a single lysine. In
vitro, CTBP sumoylation minimally required the SUMO E1 and E2 (UBC9;
601661) and SUMO1 (601912). However, Pc2 dramatically enhanced CTBP
sumoylation. The authors proposed that, in vivo, this is likely due to
the ability of Pc2 to recruit both CTBP and UBC9 to PcG bodies, thereby
bringing together substrate and E2 and stimulating the transfer of SUMO
to CTBP. These results demonstrated that Pc2 is a SUMO E3 and suggested
that PcG bodies may be sumoylation centers.

Zhang et al. (2002) demonstrated that CTBP binding to cellular and viral
transcriptional repressors is regulated by NAD+ and NADH, with NADH
being 2 to 3 orders of magnitude more effective. Levels of free nuclear
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides, determined using 2-photon
microscopy, corresponded to the levels required for half-maximal CTBP
binding and were considerably lower than those previously reported.
Agents capable of increasing NADH levels stimulated CTBP binding to its
partners in vivo and potentiated CTBP-mediated repression. Zhang et al.
(2002) proposed that this ability to detect changes in nuclear NAD+/NADH
ratio allows CTBP to serve as a redox sensor for transcription.

Kumar et al. (2002) reported biochemical and crystallographic studies
that revealed that CTBP1 is a functional dehydrogenase. In addition,
both a cofactor-dependent conformational change, with NAD+ and NADH
being equivalently effective, and the active site residues were linked
to the binding of the PXDLS consensus recognition motif on repressors,
such as E1A and RIP140 (602490). They concluded that CTBP1 is an
NAD(+)-regulated component of critical complexes for specific repression
events in cells.

CTBP is recruited to DNA by transcription factors that contain a PXDLS
motif. Shi et al. (2003) reported the identification of a CTBP complex
that contains the essential components for both gene targeting and
coordinated histone modifications, allowing for the effective repression
of genes targeted by CTBP. This complex has a molecular mass of about
1.3 to 1.5 million and contains CTBP1 and CTBP2 as well as G9A (604599),
EUHMT (607001), COREST (607675), HDAC1 (601241) and HDAC2 (605164),
NPAO, REBB1, ZNF217 (602967), and KIAA0222. Immunoprecipitation with G9A
antibodies brought down the same components as well as HPC2 (ELAC2;
605367). Shi et al. (2003) found that inhibiting the expression of CTBP
and its associated histone-modifying activities by RNA-interference
resulted in alterations of histone modifications at the promoter of the
tumor invasion suppressor gene E-cadherin (192090) and increased
promoter activity in a reporter assay.

By yeast 3-hybrid analysis, Zhang et al. (2003) found that mouse Hipk2
(606868) interacted with an E1A-Ctbp complex. Expression of Hipk2 or
exposure to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation reduced Ctbp levels via a
proteasome-mediated pathway. Coexpression of kinase-inactive Hipk2 or
small interfering RNA-mediated reduction in Hipk2 levels prevented the
UV effect. Mutation of Ctbp ser422 prevented phosphorylation as well as
UV- and Hipk2-directed Ctbp clearance. Deletion of Ctbp or reduction in
Ctbp levels promoted apoptosis in p53 (191170)-deficient cells.

Gallop et al. (2005) found that the lysophosphatidic acid
acyltransferase, or LPAAT, activity associated with CtBP/BARS (e.g.,
Weigert et al., 1999) is a copurification artifact.

Using a promoter pull-down assay followed by mass spectrometry analysis,
Flajollet et al. (2009) identified RREB1 (602209) as a protein that
bound the HLA-G (142871) promoter. RREB1 exerted repressive activity on
the promoter in HLA-G-negative cells that was mediated by recruitment of
HDAC1 and CTBP1 and/or CTBP2. The HLA-G promoter contains 3 RREB1 target
sites. Flajollet et al. (2009) proposed that the repressive activity of
RREB1 on the HLA-G promoter may be regulated by posttranslational
modifications governing its association with CTBP.

Deng et al. (2011) identified microRNA-137 (MIR137; 614304) as a
regulator of CTBP1 expression. Expression of MIR137 was inversely
correlated with that of CTBP1 in melanoma cell lines. The MIR137-binding
site in the 3-prime UTR of CTBP1 mRNA is conserved from human to
chicken. Pull-down assays revealed that MIR137 interacted with ARGO2
(EIF2C2; 606229) and CTBP1 mRNA. Cotransfection of MIR137 inhibited
expression of a reporter gene containing the CTBP1 3-prime UTR, but not
when the MIR137-binding site was deleted from the CTBP1 3-prime UTR.
Western blot and quantitative RT-PCR analyses showed that MIR137
expression in a melanoma cell line reduced CTBP1 protein levels and
increased expression of the CTBP1 target genes E-cadherin and BAX
(600040).

MAPPING

By PCR of a radiation hybrid panel, Katsanis and Fisher (1998) mapped
the CTBP1 gene to 4p16.

606298	TITLE *606298 PROTOCADHERIN-GAMMA, SUBFAMILY A, MEMBER 11; PCDHGA11
;;PCDH-GAMMA-A11
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cadherins are calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecules, and
protocadherins constitute a subfamily of nonclassic cadherins. PCDHGA11
is 1 of 22 tandemly arranged genes within the PCDHG gene cluster
(604968) on chromosome 5q31. The 22 PCDHG genes function as 'variable'
exons that are individually spliced to a downstream constant region to
form distinct PCDHG transcripts. The variable PCDHG exons encode the
extracellular and transmembrane domains of the protocadherin protein,
and the common region encodes the intracellular domain (Wu et al.,
2001). For further information on the PCDHG genes, see 604968.

CLONING

By PCR of a brain cDNA library, Wu and Maniatis (1999) cloned
full-length PCDHGA11.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Wu et al. (2001) mapped the PCDHGA11 gene
to chromosome 5q31, between the PCDHGB7 gene (606304) and a pseudogene
adjacent to the PCDHGA12 gene (603059). They localized the mouse PCDHG
genes to chromosome 18c.

607837	TITLE *607837 CLN8 GENE; CLN8
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Ranta et al. (1999) reported the positional cloning of a novel gene,
CLN8, in the critical region of chromosome 8p for progressive epilepsy
with mental retardation (EPMR; 610003), or Northern epilepsy. The CLN8
gene encodes a deduced 286-amino acid transmembrane protein with a
molecular mass of 80 kD. Ranta et al. (1999) also cloned mouse Cln8.

To determine the intracellular localization of CLN8, Lonka et al. (2000)
transiently transfected BHK cell lines with CLN8 cDNA. Using CLN8- and
cell organelle-specific antibodies with confocal immunofluorescence
microscopy, they showed that the CLN8 protein localizes primarily in the
ER, with partial localization in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment
(ERGIC). The ER-ERGIC localization was not altered in the CLN8 protein
containing a human CLN8 mutation (600143.0001). However, the truncated
murine mnd mutant protein was found only in the ER. Mutations in the ER
retrieval signal KKRP resulted in localization of CLN8 to the Golgi
apparatus. The authors concluded that CLN8 is an ER resident protein
that recycles between ER and ERGIC.

MAPPING

Ranta et al. (1999) identified the CLN8 gene within the critical region
of chromosome 8p for neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis-8 (CLN8; 600143).
Ranta (1999) stated that the Cln8 gene is located in the centromeric
region of mouse chromosome 8p, between markers D8Mit124 and D8Mit61.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Ranta et al. (1999) found that 22 Finnish patients with the Northern
epilepsy variant of CLN8, were homozygous for an arg24-to-gly mutation
in the CLN8 gene (607837.0001). The findings indicated a founder effect.

In 9 of 18 families with the so-called Turkish variant of late infantile
CLN, Ranta et al. (2004) identified 4 mutations in the CLN8 gene (see
607837.0002-607837.0004), indicating that these patients in fact had
CLN8.

In 3 unrelated Italian patients with CLN8, Cannelli et al. (2006)
identified homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the CLN8
gene (see, e.g., 607837.0005 and 607837.0006, respectively).

ANIMAL MODEL

Ranta et al. (1999) found conservation of the codon harboring the human
CLN8 mutation with the localization of a mutation in the 'motor neuron
degeneration' (mnd) mouse, a naturally occurring mouse NCL (Bronson et
al., 1993). In mnd/mnd mice, they identified a homozygous 1-bp insertion
(267-268insC at codon 90) predicting a frameshift and a truncated
protein. This was the first description of the molecular basis of a
naturally occurring animal model for NCL.

Katz et al. (2005) identified a leu164-to-pro (L164P) mutation in the
Cln8 gene in English setter dogs with autosomal recessive NCL.

CLN8, ARG24GLY

In 22 Finnish patients with the Northern epilepsy variant of CLN8
(610003), Ranta et al. (1999) found homozygosity for an arg24-to-gly
(R24G) missense mutation which resulted from a C-to-G transversion at
nucleotide 70. The carrier frequency was 1 in 135, consistent with a
founder mutation.

CLN8, TRP263CYS

In affected members of 3 families with the so-called Turkish variant of
late infantile CLN, originally reported by Topcu et al. (2004), Ranta et
al. (2004) identified homozygosity for a 789G-C transversion in exon 3
of the CLN8 gene, resulting in a trp263-to-cys (W263C) mutation. The
findings indicated that these patients in fact had CLN8 (600143). In
affected members of another Turkish family reported by Topcu et al.
(2004), Ranta et al. (2004) found compound heterozygosity for W263C and
R204C (607837.0003).

.0003

In affected members of 5 families with the so-called Turkish variant of
late infantile CLN, originally reported by Mitchell et al. (2001) and
Topcu et al. (2004), Ranta et al. (2004) identified a homozygous 610C-T
transition in exon 3 of the CLN8 gene, resulting in an arg204-to-cys
(R204C) mutation. The findings indicated that these patients in fact had
CLN8 (600143). In affected members of another Turkish family reported by
Topcu et al. (2004), Ranta et al. (2004) found compound heterozygosity
for R204C and W263C (607837.0002).

In affected members of a family with the so-called Turkish variant of
late-infantile CLN, originally reported by Mitchell et al. (2001), Ranta
et al. (2004) identified a homozygous 1-bp deletion (88delG) in the CLN8
gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination of the
protein.

.0005

In an Italian child with CLN8 (600143), born of consanguineous parents,
Cannelli et al. (2006) identified a homozygous 88G-C transversion in
exon 2 of the CLN8 gene, resulting in an ala30-to-pro (A30P)
substitution.

.0006
CEROID LIPOFUSCINOSIS, NEURONAL, 8
CLN8, 1-BP DEL, 66G

In 2 unrelated Italian children with CLN8 (600143), Cannelli et al.
(2006) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the CLN8
gene: a shared 1-bp deletion (66delG) and a different pathogenic
missense mutation in each child. Haplotype analysis of the 66delG
mutation suggested a common ancestor.

.0007
CEROID LIPOFUSCINOSIS, NEURONAL, 8
CLN8, 3-BP DEL, 180GAA

In an Italian boy with CLN8 (600143), Vantaggiato et al. (2009)
identified a homozygous 3-bp deletion (180delGAA) in exon 2 of the CLN8
gene, resulting in the deletion of residue lys61. Further studies showed
that the patient had complete isodisomy of maternal chromosome 8. In
vitro studies in human neuroblastoma cells and mouse neuronal cells
showed that the mutation did not affect protein localization neuronal
differentiation, or cellular migration, but did result in increased
cellular proliferation that was specific to neuronal cells. Cells with
the 180delGAA mutation also showed an increased apoptotic response to
NMDA. The findings suggested an indirect role for CLN8 in cell survival.

;;MULTIPLE TUMOR SUPPRESSOR 2;;

TP15;;
CDK4B INHIBITOR
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Transforming growth factor-beta (TGFB; 190180) inhibits cell
proliferation by inducing a G1-phase cell cycle arrest. Normal
progression through G1 is promoted by the activity of the
cyclin-dependent protein kinases CDK4 (123829) and CDK6, which are
inhibited by the protein p16(INK4) (CDKN2A; 600160). Hannon and Beach
(1994) isolated another member of the p16(INK4) family, which they
referred to as p15(INK4B) or p15. The expression of this protein
(CDKN2B) was induced approximately 30-fold in human keratinocytes by
treatment with TGF-beta, suggesting that p15 may act as an effector of
TGFB-mediated cell cycle arrest. Comparison of the sequence of the gene
encoding p15(INK4B) with that reported for MTS2 (Kamb et al., 1994)
demonstrated that the MTS2 sequence encodes the C-terminal 86 amino
acids of p15(INK4B). MTS2 was found by Kamb et al. (1994) to lie
adjacent to the p16 gene (CDKN2) at 9p21, and Hannon and Beach (1994)
cited unpublished work localizing the p15 gene to that position by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. Although a fragment of the p15 gene
described by Kamb et al. (1994) had been designated MTS2 (for multiple
tumor suppressor-2), Hannon and Beach (1994) favored the name INK4B for
'inhibitor of CDK4-B.'

Using RT-PCR, Burdon et al. (2011) demonstrated expression of CDKN2A in
human ocular tissues, including in the iris, ciliary body, retina, and
optic nerve.

MAPPING

The p15(INK4b) gene is located adjacent to p16(INK4a) on 9p21 and is
codeleted in a high proportion of established human cancer cell lines
(Kamb et al., 1994; Nobori et al., 1994; Hannon and Beach, 1994). Okuda
et al. (1995) used interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization,
Southern blot analysis, and PCR to analyze the tandemly linked MTS1
(600160) and MTS2 loci in primary leukemic blasts from 43 pediatric
patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
Deletions were identified of 18 of 20 cases with cytogenetically
observed abnormalities of 9p and in 5 of 23 cases with apparently normal
chromosomes, with the majority containing biallelic deletions (16
homozygous and 7 hemizygous).

Quelle et al. (1995) mapped both the p16 and the p15 gene to mouse
chromosome 4 in the C3-C6 region, which is syntenic with human 9p.

GENE FUNCTION

Cytogenetic abnormalities at 9p21 are common in many types of human
tumors. The presence of 2 functional members of the p16 family at 9p21
raises the possibility that loss of tumor suppression may involve
inactivation of either or both genes (Hannon and Beach, 1994). Deletions
of 9p21 that remove both genes (or other mutations that might inactivate
both) could simultaneously negate 2 major proliferation control
pathways.

Stone et al. (1995) reported the genomic structure of p15 and its
pattern of mRNA expression. They showed that ectopic expression of p15
inhibits growth of tumor-derived cell lines. In a search for p15
mutations in tumor cells lines and in 9p21-linked melanoma kindreds,
they found, other than the previously described homozygous deletions, no
mutations of p15. Collectively, they deduced from these observations
that p15 has a role in growth regulation but a limited role in tumor
progression.

Yu et al. (2008) demonstrated that many tumor suppressor genes have
nearby antisense RNAs and focused on the role of one RNA in silencing
p15, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor implicated in leukemia. Yu et
al. (2008) found an inverse relationship between p15-antisense (p15AS;
see CDKN2BAS, 613149) and p15 sense expression in leukemia. A p15AS
expression construct induced p15 silencing in cis and in trans through
heterochromatin formation but not DNA methylation; the silencing
persisted after p15AS was turned off, although methylation and
heterochromatin inhibitors reversed this process. The p15AS-induced
silencing was Dicer-independent. Expression of exogenous p15AS in mouse
embryonic stem cells caused p15 silencing and increased growth, through
heterochromatin formation, as well as DNA methylation after
differentiation of the embryonic stem cells. Thus, Yu et al. (2008)
concluded that natural antisense RNA may be a trigger for
heterochromatin formation and DNA methylation in tumor suppressor gene
silencing in tumorigenesis.

Li et al. (2009) showed that the Ink4/Arf locus, comprising Cdkn2a
(600160)-Cdnk2b, is completely silenced in induced pluripotent stem
(iPS) cells as well as in embryonic stem cells, acquiring the epigenetic
marks of a bivalent chromatin domain, and retaining the ability to be
reactivated after differentiation. Cell culture conditions during
reprogramming enhance the expression of the Ink4/Arf locus, further
highlighting the importance of silencing the locus to allow
proliferation and reprogramming. Indeed, Oct4 (164177), Klf4 (602253),
and Sox2 (184429) together repress the Ink4/Arf locus soon after their
expression and concomitant with the appearance of the first molecular
markers of 'stemness.' This downregulation also occurs in cells carrying
the oncoprotein simian virus-40 'large-T' antigen, which functionally
inactivates the pathways regulated by the Ink4/Arf locus, thus
indicating that the silencing of the locus is intrinsic to reprogramming
and not the result of a selective process. Genetic inhibition of the
Ink4/Arf locus has a profound positive effect on the efficiency of iPS
cell generation, increasing both the kinetics of reprogramming and the
number of emerging iPS cell colonies. In murine cells, Arf, rather than
Ink4a, is the main barrier to reprogramming by activation of p53
(191170) and p21 (CDKN1A; 116899), whereas in human fibroblasts, INK4a
is more important than ARF. Furthermore, organismal aging upregulates
the Ink4/Arf locus and, accordingly, reprogramming is less efficient in
cells from old organisms, but this defect can be rescued by inhibiting
the locus with a short hairpin RNA. Li et al. (2009) concluded that the
silencing of Ink4/Arf locus is rate-limiting for reprogramming, and its
transient inhibition may significantly improve the generation of iPS
cells.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS; see 614286) comprise a group of
clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by ineffective
hematopoiesis with an increased propensity to acute myeloid leukemic
transformation. Cameron et al. (2002) searched for mutations in the p15
gene in 5 MDS families (3 with multiple affected members in 2 successive
generations and 2 with 1 generation of affected members) and found none.

In genomewide association studies of type 2 diabetes (125853) involving
genotype data from a variety of international consortia, the Diabetes
Genetics Initiative of Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Lund
University, and Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (2007),
Zeggini et al. (2007), and Scott et al. (2007) detected association of a
single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on chromosome 9, dbSNP rs10811661,
and diabetes susceptibility. This SNP is 125 kb upstream from
CDKN2A/CDKN2B, the nearest annotated genes. All-data metaanalyses
obtained genomewide significance (OR = 1.20, P = 7.8 x 10(-15)).

Helgadottir et al. (2008) replicated the association of the dbSNP
rs10811661 T allele to type 2 diabetes in Icelandic, Danish, and United
States case-control groups (OR = 1.29, P = 2.5 x 10(-10)).

For discussion of a possible association between variation in the CDKN2B
gene and susceptibility to glioma, see GLM5 (613030).

ANIMAL MODEL

Krimpenfort et al. (2007) reported that mice deficient for all 3 open
reading frames encoded at the Cdkn2 locus (Cdkn2ab-null) are more
tumor-prone and develop a wider spectrum of tumors than Cdkn2a (600160)
mutant mice, with a preponderance of skin tumors and soft tissue
sarcomas (i.e., mesothelioma) frequently composed of mixed cell types
and often showing biphasic differentiation. Cdkn2ab-null mouse embryonic
fibroblasts were substantially more sensitive to oncogenic
transformation than Cdkn2a mutant mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Under
conditions of stress, p15(Ink4b) protein levels were significantly
elevated in mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient for p16(Ink4a).
Krimpenfort et al. (2007) concluded that p15(Ink4b) can fulfill a
critical backup function for p16(Ink4a) and suggested a model that
provided an explanation for the frequent loss of the complete
CDKN2B-CDKN2A locus in human tumors.

Visel et al. (2010) showed that deletion of the 70-kb noncoding interval
on mouse chromosome 4 orthologous to the chromosome 9p21 interval
associated with human coronary artery disease (CAD) (see CHD8, 611139)
affects cardiac expression of neighboring genes, as well as
proliferation properties of vascular cells. Mice with homozygous
deletion of the 70-kb interval (delta-70-kb) were viable but showed
increased mortality both during development and as adults. Cardiac
expression of 2 genes near the noncoding interval, Cdkn2a (600160) and
Cdkn2b, was severely reduced in delta-70-kb homozygous mice, indicating
that distant-acting gene regulatory functions are located in the
noncoding CAD risk interval. Allele-specific expression of Cdkn2b
transcripts in heterozygous mice showed that the deletion affects
expression through a cis-acting mechanism. Primary cultures of aortic
smooth muscle cells from homozygous delta-70-kb mice exhibited excessive
proliferation and diminished senescence, a cellular phenotype consistent
with accelerated CAD pathogenesis. Visel et al. (2010) concluded that,
taken together, their results provided direct evidence that the CAD risk
interval has a pivotal role in the regulation of cardiac CDKN2A/B
expression, and suggested that this region affects coronary artery
disease progression by altering the dynamics of vascular cell
proliferation.

606700	TITLE *606700 MIDNOLIN, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; MIDN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Tsukahara et al. (2000) identified the murine Midn gene using a gene
trap method. By screening an embryonic mouse cDNA library, they obtained
Midn cDNA clones predicted to encode a 508-amino acid protein containing
a ubiquitin-like domain. Tsukahara et al. (2000) noted that 3 different
cDNAs are generated by alternative splicing. RT-PCR and whole-mount in
situ hybridization analyses detected strong expression of Midn during
embryogenesis in the mesencephalon from embryonic day 11.5 to 12.5. At
day 12.5, weaker and more widespread expression was detected in various
cell types. Northern blot analysis showed Midn expression in all adult
tissues tested, with high levels in heart, lung, liver, and kidney.
Tsukahara et al. (2000) localized Midn to the nucleus and nucleolus and
identified a C-terminal 28-amino acid peptide important for nucleolar
localization. They concluded that Midn is involved in the regulation of
genes related to neurogenesis in the nucleolus.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tsukahara et al. (2000) determined that the murine Midn gene contains 9
exons.

MAPPING

Scott (2002) mapped the human MIDN gene to chromosome 19 based on
similarity between the murine Midn sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB036882)
and a chromosome 19 clone (GenBank GENBANK AC004221).

609561	TITLE *609561 CARBOXYPEPTIDASE A5; CPA5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Carboxypeptidases have functions ranging from digestion of food to
selective biosynthesis of neuroendocrine peptides. Members of the A/B
subfamily of carboxypeptidases, such as CPA5, contain an approximately
90-amino acid pro region that assists in the folding of the active
carboxypeptidase domain. Cleavage of the pro region activates the enzyme
(Wei et al., 2002).

CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to CPA1 (114850) and CPB1
(114852), Wei et al. (2002) identified CPA5. The deduced 436-amino acid
protein contains an N-terminal signal peptide, followed by a pro domain
and a carboxypeptidase catalytic domain that includes residues involved
in zinc coordination and substrate catalysis and a single disulfide
bond. CPA5 ESTs were found in testis, adult brain, and fetal heart cDNA
libraries. One of the CPA5 sequences from testis contains an alternative
exon 2 (exon 2B) not found in the other CPA5 sequences. Northern blot
analysis of mouse tissues detected Cpa5 expression in testis, but not in
kidney, liver, brain, and lung. RT-PCR detected expression in mouse
testis and pancreas and in a mouse pituitary corticotrophic cell line,
but not in any other mouse tissues examined. In situ hybridization
revealed stage-specific expression of Cpa5 in germ cells of mouse
testis. Cpa5 was also expressed in the anterior and intermediate lobes
of the pituitary, but not in the neural lobe.

GENE FUNCTION

Modeling analysis by Wei et al. (2002) predicted that, like CPA1, CPA2
(600688), and CPA3 (114851), CPA5 cleaves substrates with C-terminal
hydrophobic residues. Wei et al. (2002) found that CPA5 cleaved a
synthetic substrate, furylacryloyl-gly-leu, following removal of its pro
domain. CPA5 activity was much greater at pH 7.4 than at pH 5.6.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wei et al. (2002) determined that the CPA5 gene contains 14 exons,
including 2 alternative second exons, exons 2A and 2B. Exons 1, 2A, and
2B of CPA5 are noncoding.

MAPPING

Wei et al. (2002) mapped the CPA5 gene to a CPA gene cluster on
chromosome 7. The order of the genes is CPA2--CPA4 (607635)--CPA5--CPA1.
Bentley et al. (2003) determined that the CPA gene cluster containing
CPA5 maps to chromosome 7q32.
