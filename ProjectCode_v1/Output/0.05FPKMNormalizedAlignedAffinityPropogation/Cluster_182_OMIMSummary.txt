612355	TITLE *612355 MICAL C TERMINUS-LIKE PROTEIN; MICALCL
;;ERK2-BINDING TESTICULAR PROTEIN 1; EBITEIN1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using mouse Erk2 (MAPK1; 176948) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a
mouse brain cDNA library, Miura and Imaki (2008) cloned Micalcl, which
they called Ebitein1. The deduced 680-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 75 kD. Northern blot analysis detected
Ebitein1 expression in mouse testis, but not in 12 other mouse tissues
examined, including brain. Western blot analysis detected Ebitein1 at an
apparent molecular mass of 75 kD in testis only. Immunohistochemical
analysis showed high Ebitein1 expression in round spermatids, but not in
other testicular cells. During spermatogenesis, Ebitein1 first appeared
after meiosis when cells became haploid, then the amount of Ebitein1
gradually increased, reaching a maximum at Oakberg stage 9.
Subsequently, the level of Ebitein1 decreased such that it was
undetectable when the flagellum of the spermatozoon was generated. On a
subcellular level, Ebitein1 localized in the cytoplasm.

MAPPING

Hartz (2008) mapped the MICALCL gene to chromosome 11p15.3 based on an
alignment of the MICALCL sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK123671) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

605904	TITLE *605904 PDZ AND LIM DOMAIN PROTEIN 5; PDLIM5
;;ENIGMA-LIKE LIM DOMAIN PROTEIN;;
ENIGMA HOMOLOG; ENH
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

LIM domains are cysteine-rich double zinc fingers composed of 50 to 60
amino acids that are involved in protein-protein interactions. LIM
domain-containing proteins are scaffolds for the formation of
multiprotein complexes. The proteins are involved in cytoskeleton
organization, cell lineage specification, organ development, and
oncogenesis. Enigma family proteins (see ENIGMA; 605900) possess a
100-amino acid PDZ domain in the N terminus and 1 to 3 LIM domains in
the C terminus.

CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a rat brain cDNA library with the
regulatory domain of rat protein kinase C-beta-1 (PRKCB1; 176970) as
bait, Kuroda et al. (1996) isolated a cDNA encoding Enh. Yeast 2-hybrid
analysis showed that the LIM domains of Enh and human ENIGMA associate
with varying protein kinase C isoforms. By PCR analysis of a fetal brain
cDNA library with primers based on a partial cDNA homologous to rat Enh,
Ueki et al. (1999) isolated a full-length cDNA encoding human ENH.
Sequence analysis predicted that the 596-amino acid protein, which is
88% identical to rat Enh, has 2 pro/ser-rich regions and 3 LIM domains.
Northern blot analysis detected a 1.9-kb transcript that was
predominantly expressed in heart and skeletal muscle and a 5.6-kb
transcript that was expressed in all tissues tested.

Maeno-Hikichi et al. (2003) found that the ENH protein was expressed in
various regions of the brain, most notably hippocampi, cortex, thalamus,
hypothalamus, amygdala, and cerebellum. In hippocampal neurons, ENH
appeared to be localized in presynaptic nerve terminals.

Niederlander et al. (2004) stated that the full-length human ENH1
isoform contains an N-terminal PDZ domain and 3 C-terminal LIM domains.
ENH2, ENH3, and ENH4 are splice variants that encode progressively
shorter proteins, with ENH4 containing 215 amino acids. All transcripts
contain exons 1 through 3, which encodes the PDZ domain, and exons 8 and
9. Northern blot analysis of several human and mouse tissues detected a
1.9-kb ENH4 transcript in skeletal and cardiac muscle only. Niederlander
et al. (2004) used a probe that did not differentiate between ENH
isoforms for Western blot analysis of human cardiac and skeletal muscle.
In skeletal muscle, they found proteins with apparent molecular masses
of 29, 33, and 40 kD, which were predicted to represent ENH4, ENH3, and
ENH2, respectively. In cardiac muscle, they detected proteins with
apparent molecular masses of 33 and 64 kD, representing ENH3 and ENH1,
respectively. Only Enh3 and Enh4 were detected in mouse cardiac and
skeletal muscle, respectively. Endogenous mouse Enh and
fluorescence-tagged human ENH4 were expressed at Z discs of mouse
striated muscle.

Cheng et al. (2010) stated that 4 splice variants of mouse Enh had been
previously identified, and they cloned 5 additional variants. RT-PCR
detected expression of the Enh2 and Enh4 variants in mouse skeletal
muscle only.

GENE STRUCTURE

Niederlander et al. (2004) determined that the PDLIM5 gene contains 16
exons and spans 210.8 kb.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis, Ueki et al. (1999) mapped the ENH gene
to 4q22.

GENE FUNCTION

Using immunocytochemistry, Nakagawa et al. (2000) demonstrated that rat
Enh colocalizes with alpha-actinin-2 (Actn2; 102573) in the Z disc
region of sarcomeres of rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. GST pull-down
assays showed that the interaction occurs through the PDZ domain of Enh.

Through binding and immunoprecipitation assays on adult rat cortical
tissue, Maeno-Hikichi et al. (2003) showed that ENH interacts
specifically with protein kinase C-epsilon (PRKCE; 176975) and the C
terminus of the N-type calcium channel alpha-1B subunit (CACNA1B;
601012) to form a macromolecular complex. Functional studies in Xenopus
oocytes indicated that expression of ENH resulted in increased rapid and
specific modulation of N-type calcium channels by PKCE. The authors
concluded that through interactions with a common adaptor protein, the
formation of a kinase-substrate complex is the molecular basis for the
specificity and efficiency of cellular signaling.

Using an in vitro protein blot overlay, Niederlander et al. (2004) found
that recombinant human ENH4 interacted with 3 major proteins from mouse
skeletal muscle. They identified 1 of these binding partners as
alpha-actinin (see 102575).

ANIMAL MODEL

Cheng et al. (2010) found that Enh-null mice were indistinguishable from
wildtype littermates. However, by 1 month of age, Enh-null hearts showed
elevated expression of fetal genes and reduced expression of the Z-line
proteins calsarcin-1 (MYOZ2; 605602) and Cypher (LDB3; 605906) short
isoform (CypherS). By 3 months of age, Enh-null mice developed
cardiomyopathy characterized by enlargement of the left ventricle,
impaired systolic and diastolic heart function, and widened Z-lines.
Cardiomyopathy in Enh-null hearts was progressive, but it did not result
in sudden cardiac death. Heart-specific Enh deletion resulted in a
similar phenotype. Myofibril isolation, sucrose fractionation, and in
vitro protein pull-down assays demonstrated that Enh localized at the
Z-line in a protein complex with CypherS and calsarcin-1. Cheng et al.
(2010) concluded that Enh has a role in maintaining the integrity of the
Z-line.

238310	TITLE *238310 AMINOMETHYLTRANSFERASE; AMT
;;GLYCINE CLEAVAGE SYSTEM T PROTEIN; GCST
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The enzyme system for cleavage of glycine (glycine cleavage system; EC
2.1.2.10), which is confined to the mitochondria, is composed of 4
protein components: P protein (a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent glycine
decarboxylase; GLDC, 238300), H protein (a lipoic acid-containing
protein; GCSH, 238330), T protein (a tetrahydrofolate-requiring enzyme),
and L protein (a lipoamide dehydrogenase; DLD, 238331).

Mutations in the T, P, and H proteins have been found to cause glycine
encephalopathy (GCE; 605899).

CLONING

The T protein of the glycine cleavage system is also known as
aminomethyltransferase (AMT). Nanao et al. (1994) isolated the AMT gene
from a human placenta cosmid library. They found that the gene is about
6 kb long and contains 9 exons. They identified 2 putative
glucocorticoid-responsive elements and a putative thyroid
hormone-responsive element. By dot-blot analysis, Kure et al. (2001)
detected expression of AMT in all tissues tested except stomach and bone
marrow.

GENE FUNCTION

Sakata et al. (2001) reported the structure and expression of the
glycine cleavage system in rat central nervous system.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Nanao et al. (1994) assigned the
AMT gene to 3p21.2-p21.1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In patients with glycine encephalopathy, Nanao et al. (1994) identified
mutations in the AMT gene (238310.0001-238310.0002).

Toone et al. (2000) studied 14 unrelated patients with glycine
encephalopathy and identified mutations in 4 cases. In 2 patients,
mutations were identified in the T protein: 1 patient was homozygous for
an arg320-to-his mutation (R320H; 238310.0006), and the other patient
was heterozygous for a novel glutamine-to-termination substitution at
codon 192 (238310.0007).

Applegarth and Toone (2001) reviewed the laboratory diagnosis of glycine
encephalopathy and confirmed 9 mutations in the T protein and 8
mutations in the P protein. They also reviewed the 7 cases of transient
NKH known at that time.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, GLY269ASP

Nanao et al. (1994) found that a patient with typical glycine
encephalopathy (605899) was homozygous for a missense mutation in the
AMT gene, a G-to-A transition leading to a gly-to-asp substitution at
amino acid 269 (G269D).

.0002
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, GLY47ARG

In 2 sisters with atypical glycine encephalopathy (605899), Nanao et al.
(1994) found compound heterozygosity for 2 missense mutations in the T
protein gene: a G-to-A transition leading to a gly-to-arg substitution
at amino acid 47 (G47R) in 1 allele, and a G-to-A transition leading to
an arg-to-his substitution at amino acid 320 (R320H; 238310.0006) in the
other allele. Nanao et al. (1994) pointed out that gly269, which was
mutant in the typically severe case they studied (see 238300.0001), is
conserved in T proteins of various species, even in E. coli, whereas
gly47 and arg320, which were mutant in the atypical and milder cases,
are replaced by ala and leu, respectively, in E. coli. Thus, mutation
occurring in more conservative amino acid residues results in more
deleterious damage to the T protein and a more severe clinical
phenotype.

.0003
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, HIS42ARG

Kure et al. (1998) reported a large Israeli-Arab kindred with glycine
encephalopathy (605899). Enzymatic analysis demonstrated that T-protein
activity was deficient in the liver from 1 affected person in the
family. Mutation detection revealed a missense mutation in exon 2
resulting in an amino acid substitution from histidine to arginine at
position 42 (his42 to arg). Homozygosity for the H42R mutation was seen
in all affected members of the family.

.0004
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, 1-BP DEL, 183C

In a Japanese patient with glycine encephalopathy (605899), Kure et al.
(1998) described a 1-bp deletion (183delC) and a missense mutation,
asp276 to his (238310.0005).

.0005
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, ASP276HIS

In a Japanese patient with glycine encephalopathy (605899) of neonatal
onset, Kure et al. (1998) found a G-to-C substitution at position 955 in
exon 7, resulting in an amino acid change from aspartate to histidine at
position 276.

.0006
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, ARG320HIS

See 238310.0001 and Nanao et al. (1994).

Toone et al. (2001) screened a DNA bank from 50 patients with
enzymatically confirmed NKH and identified the arg320-to-his (R320H)
mutation in 7% of alleles.

.0007
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, GLN192TER

In a patient with neonatal-onset NKH (605899), Toone et al. (2000)
identified a C-to-T transition resulting in a glutamine-to-termination
codon substitution at residue 192 (Q192X). The other mutation in this
patient was not identified.

.0008
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, IVS7, G-A, -1

Toone et al. (2001) reported a novel splice site mutation at the -1
position of intron 7 of the AMT gene: G was converted to A. This
mutation was found in 3 unrelated families and was not found in any
normal controls.

605002	TITLE *605002 CORONIN 2B; CORO2B
;;CORONIN-LIKE PROTEIN C; CLIPINC
DESCRIPTION The Dictyostelium actin-binding protein coronin accumulates at the
leading edges of motile cells and in crown-shaped extensions on the
dorsal cell surface. Coronin is involved in cell motility, cytokinesis,
and phagocytosis, all of which depend on cytoskeletal rearrangement; see
CORO1A (605000).

By screening a frontal cortex cDNA library with a brain-enriched clone
showing similarity to Dictyostelium coronin, Nakamura et al. (1999)
isolated a full-length cDNA encoding CORO2B, which they called CLIPINC.
The predicted 475-amino acid CORO2B protein has an N-terminal domain
containing 5 WD repeats and a succeeding domain with a tendency to form
alpha helices. Northern blot analysis detected abundant expression of an
approximately 4.0-kb CORO2B transcript in brain, with moderate
expression in heart and ovary, and little or no expression in other
tissues tested. In contrast, CORO1A is primarily expressed in immune
system tissues, and CORO2A (602159) is predominantly expressed in colon,
prostate, and testis. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed Coro2a
expression in mouse cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, olfactory
bulb, and cerebellum, as well as in the inner nuclear layer of embryonic
retina and embryonic olfactory bulb. Cosedimentation analysis
demonstrated that CORO2B associates with F-actin. Immunofluorescence
analysis indicated that CORO2B accumulates at neurite tips, at focal
adhesions in association with VCL (193065), and along stress fibers.

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1999) mapped the CORO2B
gene, which they called KIAA0925, to chromosome 15.

107777	TITLE *107777 AQUAPORIN 2; AQP2
;;AQUAPORIN-CD
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The AQP2 gene encodes an aquaporin-2 water channel located in the renal
collecting tubules. Aquaporin-CHIP (AQP1; 107776) is located in the
proximal renal tubule (Fushimi et al., 1993).

CLONING

Fushimi et al. (1993) cloned the cDNA for the water channel of the
apical membrane of the kidney collecting tubule in the rat. The gene
shows 42% identity in amino acid sequence to AQP1. Expression in Xenopus
oocytes markedly increased osmotic water permeability (Pf). The
functional expression and the limited localization suggested that AQP2
is the vasopressin-regulated water channel. Fushimi et al. (1993)
referred to AQP2 as WCH-CD, for 'water channel-collecting duct.'

Sasaki et al. (1993, 1994) cloned a cDNA for human AQP2 and found that
it encodes a deduced protein with 91% amino acid identity to the rat
protein. By screening kidney cDNA in cosmid libraries with a rat AQP2
cDNA probe, Deen et al. (1994) isolated human AQP2. They found that the
predicted amino acid sequence shares 89.7% identity with the rat
protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Nielsen et al. (1995) showed that arginine vasopressin (AVP; 192340)
increases cellular water permeability by inducing exocytosis of
AQP2-laden vesicles, transferring water channels from intracellular
vesicles to the apical plasma membrane.

Using rat kidney slices and porcine kidney cells stably expressing rat
Aqp2, Bouley et al. (2000) demonstrated that AQP2 trafficking can be
stimulated by cAMP-independent pathways that utilize nitric oxide (NO).
The NO donors sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and NONOate and the NO synthase
(see 163731) substrate L-arginine mimicked the effect of vasopressin
(VP), stimulating relocation of Aqp2 from cytoplasmic vesicles to the
apical plasma membrane. SNP increased intracellular cGMP rather than
cAMP, and exogenous cGMP stimulated AQP2 membrane insertion. Atrial
natriuretic factor (108780), which signals via cGMP, also stimulated
AQP2 translocation. Both the VP and SNP effects were blocked by a kinase
inhibitor, and membrane insertion was blocked in cells expressing the
phosphorylation-deficient mutant ser256 to ala, indicating that ser256
is required for signaling.

Kanno et al. (1995) reported that aquaporin-2 is detectable in the urine
in both soluble and membrane-bound forms. In normal subjects, an
infusion of desmopressin increased the urinary excretion of aquaporin-2.
In 5 patients with central diabetes insipidus (CDI; 125700),
administration of desmopressin increased urinary excretion of
aquaporin-2; however, this response was not seen in 4 patients with
X-linked (304800) or autosomal (125800) recessive nephrogenic diabetes
insipidus. Saito et al. (1997) determined that measuring urinary
excretion of AQP2 is of value in diagnosing central diabetes insipidus.
In normal subjects under ad libitum water drinking, urinary AQP2 was
positively correlated with plasma arginine vasopressin levels, but not
with urinary osmolality. Saito et al. (1997) found that measurement of
AQP2 was also helpful when using a hypertonic saline infusion to
diagnose CDI. Saito et al. (1999) investigated whether urinary excretion
of AQP2 under ad libitum water intake was of value in the
differentiation between psychogenic polydipsia and CDI. A 30-minute
urine collection was made at 0900 hours in 3 groups: 11 patients with
CDI (22 to 68 years old), 10 patients with psychogenic polydipsia (28 to
60 years old), and 15 normal subjects (21 to 38 years old). In the
patients with CDI, the plasma arginine vasopressin level was low despite
hyperosmolality, resulting in hypotonic urine. Urinary excretion of AQP2
was 37 +/- 15 fmol/mg creatinine, a value one-fifth less than that in
the normal subjects. In the patients with psychogenic polydipsia, plasma
arginine vasopressin and urinary osmolality were as low as those in the
patients with CDI. However, urinary excretion of AQP2 of 187 +/- 45
fmol/mg creatinine was not decreased, and its excretion was equal to
that in the normal subjects. The results indicated that urinary
excretion of AQP2, under ad libitum water drinking, participates in the
differentiation of psychogenic polydipsia from CDI.

Ishikawa et al. (2001) undertook to determine whether urinary excretion
of AQP2 participates in the involvement of arginine vasopressin in
hyponatremia less than 130 mmol/L in 33 elderly subjects more than 64
years of age during the last 5-year period. Plasma AVP levels remained
relatively high despite hypoosmolality and were tightly linked with
exaggerated urinary excretion of AQP2 and antidiuresis. Plasma AVP and
urinary excretion of AQP2 were not reduced after an acute water load
test. The inappropriate secretion of AVP was evident in the patients
with the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of diuretic hormone (SIADH)
and hypopituitarism, and hydrocortisone replacement normalized urinary
excretion of AQP2 and renal water excretion in those with
hypopituitarism. The authors concluded that urinary excretion of AQP2
may be a more sensitive measure of AVP effect on renal collecting duct
cells than are plasma AVP levels, and that increased urinary excretion
of AQP2 shows exaggerated AVP-induced antidiuresis in hyponatremic
subjects in the elderly. In addition, mineralocorticoid-responsive
hyponatremia of the elderly has to be carefully differentiated from
SIADH in elderly subjects.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, Sasaki et al. (1993, 1994) mapped the AQP2
gene to chromosome 12q13, very close to the site of major intrinsic
protein (MIP; 154050). The investigators suggested that a defect in the
AQP2 gene is the basis of the autosomal form of nephrogenic diabetes
insipidus (NDI; 125800).

Deen et al. (1994) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to map the
AQP2 gene to chromosome 12.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a male patient with autosomal recessive nephrogenic diabetes
insipidus (125800), Deen et al. (1994) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the AQP2 gene (R187C; 107777.0001 and
S216P; 107777.0002). Functional expression studies in Xenopus oocytes
revealed that each mutation resulted in nonfunctional water channel
proteins. Deen et al. (1995) found that expression of 3 mutant AQP2
proteins, R187C, S216P, and G64R (107777.0004), in Xenopus oocytes
resulted in nonfunctional water channels. The transcripts encoding the
missense AQPs were translated as efficiently as wildtype transcript and
were equally stable. Immunocytochemistry demonstrated that the mutant
AQP2 did not label in the plasma membrane. The authors proposed that the
inability of the AQP2 proteins to facilitate water transport was caused
by an impaired routing to the plasma membrane.

Missense mutations and a single-nucleotide deletion in the AQP2 gene
were found by van Lieburg et al. (1994) in 3 NDI patients from
consanguineous families (107777.0001; 107777.0004-107777.0005).
Expression studies in Xenopus oocytes showed that the mutated AQP2
proteins were nonfunctional. Mulders et al. (1997) reported 3 additional
NDI patients who were homozygous for mutations in the AQP2 gene.
Functional expression studies showed that 2 of the mutations
(107777.0006 and 107777.0007) resulted in functional proteins that were
apparently retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and impaired in their
routing to the plasma membrane.

In a study of a Dutch family with autosomal dominant NDI, Mulders et al.
(1998) identified a mutation (107777.0009) in the AQP2 gene that
exhibited a dominant-negative effect.

In affected members of 3 unrelated families with autosomal dominant NDI,
Kuwahara et al. (2001) identified 3 different deletion mutations in exon
4 of the AQP2 gene (see, e.g., 107777.0014), all of which resulted in an
elongated protein with a C-terminal tail of 61 amino acids. The
predicted wildtype AQP2 protein contains 271 amino acids, whereas the
predicted mutant proteins contained 330 to 333 amino acids because of
the frameshift. In Xenopus oocytes injected with mutant AQP2 cRNAs, the
osmotic water permeability was much smaller than that of oocytes with
the AQP2 wildtype (14 to 17%). The results suggested that the
trafficking of mutant AQP2 was impaired due to elongation of the
C-terminal tail. The dominant-negative effect was attributed to
oligomerization of the wildtype and mutant AQP2s. Marr et al. (2002)
reported similar findings (see 107777.0015).

Carroll et al. (2006) identified the molecular basis of NDI in Arab
families. The authors identified 2 novel missense mutations in AQP2.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yang et al. (2001) generated a mouse knockin model of NDI generated by
targeted gene replacement with the thr126-to-met mutation (T126M;
107777.0007) along with mutations to preserve the consensus sequence for
N-linked glycosylation found in human AQP2. The mutant mice died within
6 days after birth unless given supplemental fluid. Urine/serum analysis
showed a urinary concentrating defect with serum hyperosmolality and low
urine osmolality that could not be corrected by a V2 vasopressin
agonist. Northern blot analysis revealed upregulated Aqp2-T126M
transcripts identical in size to wildtype Aqp2. Immunoblot analysis
indicated complex glycosylation of wildtype Aqp2 but endoglycosidase
H-sensitive core glycosylation of the mutant, suggesting ER retention.
Immunohistologic and histologic analyses revealed kidney collecting duct
dilatation, papillary atrophy, and some plasma membrane Aqp2 expression.
Yang et al. (2001) concluded that the Aqp2-T126M mutant creates a more
severe phenotype than those observed in mice lacking water channels
Aqp1, Aqp3 (600170), or Aqp4 (600308), and establishes a mouse model of
human autosomal NDI.

Rojek et al. (2006) found that Aqp2-null mice appeared normal at birth
but failed to thrive and died within 2 weeks of age. Kidneys from
Aqp2-null pups showed papillary atrophy and signs of hydronephrosis.
Mice with Aqp2 knockout targeted to the renal collecting ducts survived
to adulthood, but they showed decreased body weight, 10-fold increased
urine production, and decreased urinary osmolality and were unable to
adapt to water deprivation. Rojek et al. (2006) concluded that AQP2
expression in kidney connecting tubules is sufficient for survival and
that AQP2 expression in collecting ducts is required to regulate body
water balance.

Congenital progressive hydronephrosis (cph) is a spontaneous recessive
mutation that causes severe hydronephrosis and obstructive nephropathy
in mice. McDill et al. (2006) found that homozygous cph mice were born
at mendelian ratios and appeared grossly normal at birth, but they grew
slowly and showed significant size and weight differences from postnatal
day 8 onward. About 90% of cph mice died between 2 and 4 weeks of age.
By 2 weeks, most had visibly enlarged abdomens and appeared lethargic.
McDill et al. (2006) identified a ser256-to-leu (S256L) mutation in the
Aqp2 gene as the cause of cph. The S256L substitution in the cytoplasmic
tail of the Aqp2 protein prevented phosphorylation at S256 and the
subsequent accumulation of Aqp2 on the apical membrane of the collecting
duct principal cells. The interference with normal trafficking of Aqp2
by the S256L mutation resulted in a severe urine concentration defect.
The NDI symptoms and the absence of developmental defects in the
pyeloureteral peristaltic machinery before the onset of hydronephrosis
suggested that the congenital obstructive nephropathy was likely the
result of the polyuria.

In a male patient with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (125800), Deen et
al. (1994) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
AQP2 gene: a 559C-T transition in exon 3, resulting in an arg187-to-cys

ser216-to-pro (S216P; 107777.0002) substitution. The former mutation was
inherited from the father and the latter from the mother. Functional
expression studies in Xenopus oocytes showed that both mutations
resulted in a nonfunctional protein.

Van Lieburg et al. (1994) identified homozygosity for the R187C mutation
in a Dutch patient with NDI. He was born of consanguineous parents; 3
other children in the family had died of severe dehydration and

Mulders et al. (1998) reported the first family in which nephrogenic
diabetes insipidus segregated as an autosomal dominant trait (125800).
An affected mother and daughter had a glu258-to-lys (E258K) mutation in
the AQP2 gene. Functional expression studies showed that the mutant
protein conferred only a small increase in water permeability, as a
result of reduced expression at the plasma membrane. Coexpression of
wildtype AQP2 with the E258K mutant revealed a dominant-negative effect
on the water permeability conferred by wildtype AQP2. This effect was
not seen when the wildtype protein was coexpressed with the AQP2 R187C
mutant (107777.0001) in recessive NDI. The physiologically important
phosphorylation of ser256 by protein kinase A was not affected by the
E258K mutation. Immunoblot and microscopic analyses revealed that the
E258K mutant was retained in the Golgi compartment. Since AQPs are
thought to tetramerize, the retention of AQP2-E258K together with
wildtype AQP2 in mixed tetramers in the Golgi compartment was a likely
explanation for the dominant inheritance of NDI.

In Japanese female sibs with autosomal recessive nephrogenic diabetes
insipidus (125800), Goji et al. (1998) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the AQP2 gene: a 374C-T transition in
exon 2, resulting in a thr125-to-met (T125M) substitution, and a 523G-A
transition, resulting in a gly175-to-arg (G175R; 107777.0011)
substitution. The water permeability of oocytes injected with wildtype
complementary RNA increased 9.0-fold compared with the Pf of
water-injected oocytes, whereas the increases in the Pf of oocytes
injected with T125M and G175R RNA were only 1.7-fold and 1.5-fold,
respectively. Immunoblot and immunocytochemistry indicated that the
plasma membrane expressions of T125M and G175R AQP2 proteins were
comparable to that of the wildtype, suggesting that although neither the
T125M nor G175R mutation had a significant effect on plasma membrane
expression, they distorted both the structure and function of the
aqueous pore of AQP2. These results provided evidence that the NDI in
patients with T125M and G175R mutations is attributable not to the
misrouting of AQP2, but to the disrupted water channel function.

AQP2, LEU22VAL

In a female patient with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (125800),
Canfield et al. (1997) identified compound heterozygosity for 2
mutations in the AQP2 gene: a leu22-to-val (L22V) substitution in exon
1, and a cys181-to-trp (C181W; 107777.0013) substitution in exon 3. The
patient had symptoms dating from infancy, and responded to large doses
of desmopressin which decreased urine volume from 10 to 4 liters per
day. Neither the parents nor the 3 sisters were polyuric. Residue cys181
in AQP2 is the site for inhibition of water permeation by mercurial
compounds and is located near the NPA motif conserved in all aquaporins.
Osmotic water permeability in Xenopus oocytes injected with cRNA
encoding the mutant C181W AQP2 protein was not increased over water
control, while expression of L22V cRNA increased the osmotic water
permeability to approximately 60% of that for wildtype AQP2. Coinjection
of the mutant cRNAs with the wildtype cRNA did not affect the function
of the wildtype AQP2. Immunolocalization of AQP2-transfected CHO cells
showed that the C181W mutant had an endoplasmic reticulum-like
intracellular distribution, whereas L22V and wildtype AQP2 showed
endosome and plasma membrane staining. Canfield et al. (1997) concluded
that AQP2 mutations can confer partially responsive nephrogenic diabetes
insipidus.

In a 3-generation family with autosomal dominant inheritance of NDI
(125800), Marr et al. (2002) identified a 1-bp deletion (727delG) in the
AQP2 gene. The predicted mutant protein had an altered and extended
C-terminal tail. When expressed in renal epithelial cells, the mutant
protein predominantly localized to the basolateral membrane and late
endosomes/lysosomes, whereas wildtype AQP2 was expressed in the apical
membrane. When coexpressed, wildtype AQP2 and AQP2-727G formed
heterooligomers that mainly colocalized to late endosomes/lysosomes. The
cells showed reduced water permeability due to reduced plasma membrane
expression of wildtype AQP2. On the basis of their own data and the data
of Kuwahara et al. (2001) (see 107777.0014), Marr et al. (2002)
hypothesized that misrouting, rather than lack of function, may be a
general mechanism for the 'loss of function' phenotype in dominant NDI.

(Q57P) substitution, and a 299G-T transversion, resulting in a
gly100-to-val (G100V; 107777.0017) substitution. Expression of the Q57P

respectively, in the water permeability in contrast to an 8.0-fold
increase in oocytes injected with wildtype cRNA. The results provided
evidence that the Q57P and G100V mutations in congenital nephrogenic
diabetes insipidus are attributable to the misrouting of AQP2. The

De Mattia et al. (2004) described 2 families with autosomal recessive
NDI (125800) in which affected individuals were compound heterozygotes
for a 785C-T transition in the AQP2 gene, resulting in a pro262-to-leu
(P262L) substitution in the C-terminal tail, and either a 568G-A
transition in the AQP2 gene, resulting in an ala190-to-thr (A190T;
107777.0019) substitution, or an R187C (107777.0001) substitution,
respectively. Upon expression in oocytes, P262L AQP2 protein properly
folded and was functional in contrast to the R187C and A190T proteins.
In polarized epithelial cells, P262L protein was retained in
intracellular vesicles and did not localize to the ER. Upon coexpression
with wildtype AQP2, P262L protein interacted with wildtype AQP2, and the
resulting heterotetramer properly localized to the apical membrane. De
Mattia et al. (2004) concluded that P262L would act as a mutant in
autosomal dominant NDI, except that its missorting is overruled by
apical sorting of wildtype AQP2.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CD44 is an integral cell membrane glycoprotein with a postulated role in
matrix adhesion lymphocyte activation and lymph node homing (Aruffo et
al., 1990).

CLONING

Telen et al. (1983) used a murine monoclonal antibody (A3D8) to identify
an erythrocyte antigen inhibited by the In(Lu) gene. Telen et al. (1984)
showed that the A3D8 antigenic property resides on an 80-kD red cell
membrane protein which is present in only trace amounts in In(Lu)
Lu(a-b-) red cells (INLU; 111150). Haynes (1986) had evidence that the
A1G3 and A3D8 monoclonal antibodies bind to different epitopes on the
same 80-kD molecule. The monoclonal antibody A3D8 recognized an antigen
officially called MDU3, for 'monoclonal Duke University, 3,' or CD44.
Telen (1992) knew of no evidence that the INLU and CD44 (MDU3) genes are
the same.

By screening cDNA libraries prepared from hemopoietic cell lines,
Stamenkovic et al. (1989) isolated CD44 clones. Immunoprecipitation of
CD44 from transfected COS cells and cultured cell lines detected
cell-specific expression of an 80- to 90-kD protein and a 160-kD
protein. Several minor forms of 52 to 200 kD were variably present in
different cell types. RNA blot analysis revealed transcripts of 1.6,
2.2, and 5.0 kb in hemopoietic cell lines. RNA blot analysis of
carcinoma cell lines revealed 3 patterns of expression: the first,
exemplified by melanoma cell lines, was identical to the hemopoietic
cell pattern associated with the 80- to 90-kD isoform; the second,
exemplified by a colon carcinoma cell line, showed transcripts of 2.0,
2.6, and 5.6 kb associated with the 160-kD isoform; and the third,
exemplified by another colon carcinoma cell line, was a composite of the
first 2 patterns. All primary carcinoma specimens examined showed
prevalent CD44 transcripts of either hemopoietic or composite type. The
CD44 cDNA encodes a 361-amino acid protein with a 20-residue secretory
signal peptide, a 248-residue extracellular N-terminal domain with
multiple N- and O-linked glycosylation sites, a 21-amino acid
transmembrane domain, and a 72-residue hydrophilic cytoplasmic domain.
The mature protein has a calculated molecular mass of 37 kD. Sequence
analysis suggested homology with chicken and rat cartilage link proteins
(HAPLN1; 115435).

Stefanova et al. (1989) demonstrated that the lymphocyte homing receptor
is identical to the human leukocyte surface glycoprotein called CDw44,
on the basis of studies at the Third International Workshop on Human
Leukocyte Differentiation Antigens. It also appears to be identical to
the Pgp-1 glycoprotein of Omary et al. (1988).

GENE FAMILY

A table of all the CD antigens was provided by Schlossman et al. (1994)
with a list of the common names, the size in kilodaltons, and the nature
of the protein (adhesion, myeloid, platelet, and B cell, T cell, etc.).

GENE STRUCTURE

Screaton et al. (1992) found that the CD44 gene contains 19 exons
spanning 50 kb of genomic DNA. They identified 10 alternatively spliced
exons within the extracellular domain, including 1 exon that had not
previously been reported. In addition to the inclusion or exclusion of
whole exons, additional diversity was generated through the utilization
of internal splice donor and acceptor sites within 2 of the exons. A
variation in the cytoplasmic domain was shown to result from the
alternative splicing of 2 exons. Thus the genomic structure of CD44 is
remarkably complex, and alternative splicing is the basis of its
structural and functional diversity.

Nedvetzki et al. (2003) noted that human CD44 isoforms are generated
from 9 variant exons (v2 to v10) inserted in different combinations
between 2 constant regions consisting of 5 exons at the N terminus and 4
exons at the C terminus (constant exon 19 is noncoding). Direct splicing
of constant exon 5 to constant exon 16, thereby skipping the variant
exons, generates the standard CD44 isoform.

GENE FUNCTION

Aruffo et al. (1990) demonstrated that CD44 is the main cell surface
receptor for hyaluronate. Mature lymphocytes in the circulation migrate
selectively from the bloodstream to different lymphatic tissues through
specialized high endothelial venules (HEV). Molecules on the surface of
lymphocytes called homing receptors interact specifically with HEV and
play a central role in the migration.

Splice variants of the glycoprotein CD44 may be associated with
metastases and therefore may be useful in the early detection of
metastatic potential in surgical biopsy specimens, as well as in the
early diagnosis of cancer in screening programs, assessment of remaining
disease, and early detection of recurrence (Matsumura and Tarin, 1992).
Mayer et al. (1993) found that expression of CD44, which is not found in
normal gastric mucosa and is found in only 49% of primary tumors, was
associated with distant metastases at time of diagnosis and with tumor
recurrence and increased mortality from gastric cancer.

Weber et al. (1996) noted that the CD44 gene encodes a transmembrane
protein that is expressed as a family of molecular isoforms generated
from alternative RNA splicing and posttranslational modifications.
Certain CD44 isoforms that regulate activation and migration of
lymphocytes and macrophages may also enhance local growth and metastatic
spread of tumor cells. One ligand of CD44 is hyaluronic acid, binding of
which to the NH2-terminal domain of CD44 enhances cellular aggregation
and tumor cell growth. (Krainer et al. (1991) referred to CD44 as a
'hyaladherin' -- see 601269.) Weber et al. (1996) demonstrated that
another ligand is osteopontin (166490). Osteopontin induces cellular
chemotaxis but not homotypic aggregation of cells, whereas the inverse
is true for the interaction between CD44 and hyaluronate. The
alternative responses to CD44 ligation may be exploited by tumor cells
to allow OPN-mediated metastatic spread and hyaluronate-dependent growth
in newly colonized tissues in the process of tumor metastasis.

Sherman et al. (1998) investigated the role of CD44 proteins in early
limb development. Members of this family of transmembrane glycoproteins
are expressed by cells of the limb bud, including those of the apical
ectodermal ridge (AER). Distinct CD44 variants are generated from a
single gene by alternative RNA splicing of up to 10 variant exons and by
extensive posttranslational modifications. The amino acid sequences
encoded by these variant exons are located in the extracellular portion
of the protein near the transmembrane domain. A standard form of CD44
lacking these variant sequences is expressed by numerous cell types and
is the smallest CD44 protein. It carries no variant exon sequences.
Splice variants are expressed in only a limited number of tissues and in
certain tumors. Signals from the AER of the developing vertebrate limb,
including fibroblast growth factor-8 (600483), can maintain limb
mesenchymal cells in proliferative state. Sherman et al. (1998) reported
that a specific CD44 splice variant is crucial for the proliferation of
these mesenchymal cells. Epitopes carried by this variant colocalize
temporally and spatially with FGF8 in the AER throughout early limb
development. A splice variant containing the same sequence expressed on
model cells binds both FGF4 (164980) and FGF8 and stimulates mesenchymal
cells in vitro. Sherman et al. (1998) found that when applied to the
AER, an antibody against a specific CD44 epitope blocked FGF
presentation and inhibited limb outgrowth. Therefore, CD44 is necessary
for limb development and functions in a novel growth factor presentation
mechanism likely relevant to other physiologic and pathologic situations
in which a cell surface protein presents a signaling molecule to a
neighboring cell.

Cywes and Wessels (2001) demonstrated that CD44-dependent group A
Streptococcus binding to polarized monolayers of human keratinocytes
induced marked cytoskeletal rearrangements manifested by membrane
ruffling and disruption of intercellular junctions. Transduction of the
signal induced by group A Streptococcus binding to CD44 on the
keratinocyte surface involved Rac1 (602048) and the cytoskeleton linker
protein ezrin (123900), as well as tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular
proteins. Studies of bacterial translocation in 2 models of human skin
indicated that cell signaling triggered by interaction of the group A
Streptococcus capsule with CD44 opened intercellular junctions and
promoted tissue penetration by group A Streptococcus through a
paracellular route. Cywes and Wessels (2001) concluded that their
results support a model of host cytoskeleton manipulation and tissue
invasion by an extracellular bacterial pathogen.

Nedvetzki et al. (2003) identified a CD44 variant, designated CD44vRA,
in synovial fluid aspirated from 23 of 30 patients with rheumatoid
arthritis (RA; 180300). Sequence analysis showed that the CD44vRA
isoform contains an intron-derived CAG trinucleotide inclusion 5-prime
to constant exon 5 within the CD44v3-v10 isoform. Functional expression
studies in human cells showed that the CD44vRA variant interacted with
FGF2 (134920) via the heparan sulfate on exon v3 in a way that enhanced
binding and activation of soluble FGFR1 (136350) to a greater extent
than CD44v3-v10. Synovial fluid cells from RA patients bound soluble
FGFR1 more intensively than control cells. Nedvetzki et al. (2003)
postulated that activation of FGFR1 may play a role in the RA
inflammatory process.

In a mouse hindlimb model of arteriogenesis, van Royen et al. (2004)
found that Cd44 expression increased strongly during collateral vessel
growth in wildtype mice and that arteriogenesis was severely impaired in
Cd44 -/- mice. The defective arteriogenesis was accompanied by reduced
leukocyte trafficking to sites of collateral artery growth and reduced
expression of FGF2 and platelet-derived growth factor-B protein (PDGFB;
190040). In 14 consecutive patients with single-vessel coronary artery
disease, van Royen et al. (2004) found that the maximal expression of
CD44 on activated monocytes was reduced in patients with poor
collateralization compared to patients with good collateralization. Van
Royen et al. (2004) concluded that CD44 plays a pivotal role in
arteriogenesis.

By analyzing a human breast cancer cell line transduced with a micro RNA
(miRNA) expression library, Huang et al. (2008) found that human miR373
(611954) and miR520C stimulated cell migration and invasion in vitro and
in vivo. Using expression array analysis, they found that the migration
phenotype of miR373- and miR520C-expressing cells depended on
suppression of CD44. Upregulation of miR373 correlated inversely with
CD44 expression in breast cancer metastasis samples. The authors noted
that increased expression of the most common CD44 isoform correlates
with overall survival of breast cancer patients.

Godar et al. (2008) found that p53 (TP53; 191170) negatively regulated
CD44 expression in normal human mammary epithelial cells by binding to a
noncanonical p53-binding sequence in the CD44 promoter. Inhibition of
CD44 enabled the cells to respond to stress-induced, p53-dependent
cytostatic and apoptotic signals that would have otherwise been blocked
by CD44. In the absence of p53, CD44 promoted growth in a highly
tumorigenic mammary epithelial cell line. In both normal and tumorigenic
cell lines, p63 (TP63; 603273) positively regulated CD44 expression.

MAPPING

Francke et al. (1983) showed that the antigens defined by monoclonal
antibodies A3D8 and A1G3 are determined by genes on 11p.

The mouse monoclonal antibody Hermes-3 recognizes the 85- to 95-kD human
lymphocyte homing receptor. Using mouse-human T-lymphocyte hybrids and
hybrids of Chinese hamster ovary cells with human amniotic fibroblasts,
Ala-Kapee et al. (1989) found that Hermes-3 expression, as demonstrated
by indirect immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation, was determined
by 11pter-p13. Forsberg et al. (1989) refined the assignment of the
lymphocyte homing receptor gene to 11pter-p13 by study of Chinese
hamster-human cell hybrids in which the human parent cells had various
deletions of human chromosome 11. Although CD44 may have function as a
lymphocyte homing receptor, the gene that maps to chromosome 11 is
distinct from the lymph node homing receptor located on chromosome 1
(153240) (Seldin, 1990). In the mouse, the corresponding gene has been
referred to as Ly-24.

Cianfriglia et al. (1992) mapped a drug-sensitivity marker, MC56, to
11pter-p13. Identity of the protein to the CD44 antigen, suggested on
other grounds, was supported by the map location.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The Indian blood group (609027) comprises 2 antigens, In(a) and In(b),
which reside on CD44. By RT-PCR analysis of cDNA extracted from
In(a+b-)-transformed B lymphocytes, Telen et al. (1996) identified the
CD44 polymorphism that causes the In(b-) phenotype. The polymorphism
results in an arg46-to-pro change (R46P; 107269.0001), removing the
basically charged amino acid at the C terminus of the hyaluronan
(HA)-binding motif of CD44. In previous studies using chimeric proteins,
arg46 was shown to be crucial for HA binding by CD44 (Yang et al.,
1994). However, Telen et al. (1996) demonstrated that the R46P change
does not reduce HA binding to CD44.

ANIMAL MODEL

Schmits et al. (1997) generated mice deficient in all known isoforms of
Cd44 by targeting exons encoding the invariant N-terminal region of the
molecule. Mice were born in mendelian ratio without any obvious
developmental or neurologic deficits. Hematologic impairment was
evidenced by altered tissue distribution of myeloid progenitors with
increased levels of colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage in bone
marrow and reduced numbers in spleen. Fetal liver colony-forming
unit-spleen and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor mobilization
assays, together with reduced colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage
in peripheral blood, suggested that progenitor egress from the bone
marrow was defective. Mice also developed exaggerated granuloma
responses to Cryotosporidium parvum infection. Tumor studies showed that
SV40-transformed Cd44-deficient fibroblasts were highly tumorigenic in
nude mice, whereas reintroduction of Cd44 expression into these
fibroblasts resulted in a dramatic inhibition of tumor growth.

Teder et al. (2002) studied the role of Cd44 in lung inflammation by
using the Cd44-deficient mice generated by Schmits et al. (1997). After
intratracheal administration of bleomycin, 75% of Cd44-deficient mice
died by day 14. They developed unremitting inflammation, characterized
by impaired clearance of apoptotic neutrophils, persistent accumulation
of hyaluronan fragments at the site of the tissue injury, and impaired
activation of transforming growth factor beta-1 (190180). This phenotype
was partially reversed by reconstitution with Cd44+ cells, thus
demonstrating a critical role for this receptor in resolving lung
inflammation.

Using immunohistochemistry, Leemans et al. (2003) confirmed that
Cd44-high cells accumulated in mouse lungs following intranasal
infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Cd44 -/- mice, however, had a
50% reduction in pulmonary macrophages 2 weeks after infection, although
the absolute numbers of leukocytes were unchanged. By 5 weeks after
infection, a significant reduction in Cd4 (186940)-positive lymphocyte
numbers was observed in mutant mice. At both time points, the
Cd44-deficient mice displayed disorganized granulomas containing
predominantly polymorphonuclear neutrophils rather than well-demarcated
granulomas consisting of lymphocytes and macrophages. Splenocytes were
more numerous in mice lacking Cd44, and they secreted significantly more
Ifng (147570) in response to antigen-specific stimulation than
splenocytes of wildtype mice. Flow cytometric analysis showed that human
CD44 bound to M. tuberculosis, and Cd44 -/- mouse macrophages contained
fewer bacteria than wildtype macrophages. The mutant mice allowed
greater replication of M. tuberculosis in lung and liver and had reduced
survival compared with wildtype mice. Leemans et al. (2003) proposed
that CD44 mediates resistance to mycobacterial infection by promoting
binding and phagocytosis by macrophages and by recruiting these cells to
the site of infection.

TNF (191160) is a major inducer of chronic inflammation, and its
overexpression leads to chronic inflammatory arthritis. Hayer et al.
(2005) crossed Cd44 -/- mice with mice transgenic for human TNF and
found that destruction of joints and progressive crippling was far more
severe in Cd44 -/- transgenic mice than in transgenic mice expressing
Cd44. Cd44 -/- transgenic mice exhibited increased systemic bone
resorption due to an increase in the number, size, and activity of
osteoclasts. Bone formation and osteoblast differentiation were not
affected. Cd44 -/- osteoclasts had an enhanced response to TNF that was
associated with increased activation of p38 (MAPK14; 600289). Hayer et
al. (2005) concluded that CD44 is a critical inhibitor of TNF-induced
joint destruction and inflammatory bone loss.

Krause et al. (2006) found that mice lacking Cd44 were as susceptible as
wildtype mice to murine chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; 608232) after
challenge with BCR-ABL virus. However, bone marrow cells from Cd44 -/-
mice transduced with the virus showed defective homing to recipient bone
marrow, resulting in decreased engraftment and reduced CML-like disease.
In contrast, Cd44 was dispensable for induction of B-lymphoblastic
leukemia-like disease. Krause et al. (2006) concluded that CD44 is
required for leukemic stem cells that initiate CML.

Jin et al. (2006) found that treatment with activating monoclonal
antibodies to CD44 markedly reduced leukemic repopulation in nonobese
diabetic (NOD)/severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice challenged
with human acute myeloid leukemia (AML; 601626) cells. Absence of
leukemia following serial tumor transplantation experiments in mice
demonstrated direct targeting of AML leukemic stem cells (LSCs).
Treatment of engrafted mice with anti-CD44 reduced the number of Cd34
(142230)-positive/Cd38 (107270)-negative primitive stem cells and
increased the number of Cd14 (158120)-positive monocytic cells.
Anti-CD44 treatment also diminished the homing capacity of SCID
leukemia-initiating cells to bone marrow and spleen. Jin et al. (2006)
concluded that CD44 is a key regulator of AML LSCs, which require a
niche to maintain their stem cell properties. They suggested that CD44
targeting may help eliminate quiescent AML LSCs.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
INDIAN BLOOD GROUP SYSTEM POLYMORPHISM
CD44, ARG46PRO

The Indian blood group (609027) comprises 2 antigens, In(a) and In(b),
which reside on CD44. By RT-PCR analysis of cDNA extracted from
In(a+b-)-transformed B lymphocytes, Telen et al. (1996) identified the
CD44 polymorphism that causes the In(b-) phenotype. The G-to-C change at
nucleotide 252 results in an arg46-to-pro change (R46P), removing the
basically charged amino acid at the C terminus of the hyaluronan
(HA)-binding motif of CD44. In previous studies using chimeric proteins,
arg46 was shown to be crucial for HA binding by CD44 (Yang et al.,
1994). However, Telen et al. (1996) demonstrated that the R46P change
does not reduce HA binding to CD44.

613396	TITLE *613396 DOWN SYNDROME CRITICAL REGION GENE 8; DSCR8
;;MALIGNANT MELANOMA-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1; MMA1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using array analysis to identify genes differentially expressed in
metastatic and nonmetastatic human melanoma cell lines, followed by EST
database analysis and PCR, de Wit et al. (2002) cloned 2 splice variants
of DSCR8, which they called MMA1A and MMA1B. The full-length 91-amino
acid MMA1A protein has a calculated molecular mass of 10 kD. It has 3
phosphorylation sites and 1 N-myristoylation site. The MMA1B transcript
lacks exon 3 and encodes a deduced 37-amino acid protein that has a
calculated molecular mass of 4 kD. MMA1B has a single phosphorylation
site. RT-PCR analysis of 20 tissues detected both MMA1 transcripts in
testis, but not in any other tissue examined. Nested PCR revealed low
levels of MMA1A and/or MMA1B in some other tissues.

Using RT-PCR, de Wit et al. (2005) identified 4 additional MMA1 splice
variants, which they designated MMA1C through MMA1F, in malignant
melanomas. These transcripts differ in the presence or absence of exon 3
and in selection of alternate splice sites in intron 2. Alternative
splicing changes the lengths of exons 2 and 3 and the reading frame. The
deduced proteins contain 41 to 97 amino acids. Nested PCR analysis
revealed MMA1C through MMA1E in testis, but not in any other normal
tissue examined. MMA1F was detected in only 1 malignant melanoma sample,
suggesting that the splice site used in MMA1F may be the result of
mutation. Database analysis revealed orthologs of MMA1 only in
chimpanzee.

Dunn et al. (2006) found that the DSCR4 (604829) and DSCR8 genes were
transcribed from a bidirectional promoter and showed a similar pattern
of expression. RT-PCR followed by Southern blot analysis detected 2
DSCR4 transcripts and 4 DSCR8 transcripts in prostate, skeletal muscle,
testis, and placenta. Robust expression of DSCR4 alone was detected in
thymus, and low levels of DSCR8 alone were detected in brain, kidney,
and bone marrow. Both DSCR4 and DSCR8 transcripts were also detected in
placenta and testicular teratoma cell lines, but not in HeLa cells. Dunn
et al. (2006) found that DSCR4 and DSCR8 appeared to evolve exclusively
in primates, although DSCR4 was not found in Old World monkeys. The
bidirectional promoter also appeared to be highly conserved in primates.

GENE FUNCTION

Using PCR analysis, de Wit et al. (2002) detected MMA1A and MMA1B
transcripts in 20% of primary melanomas and in about 30% of melanoma
metastasis, suggesting that expression emerges during malignant
progression. PCR analysis also detected MMA1 in some tumor lesions of
ileum, esophagus, and mammary gland, in several malignant melanoma cell
lines, and in tumor cell lines of lung, liver, colon, and bladder.

By examining MMA1 expression in a melanocytic tumor progression series,
de Wit et al. (2005) found that all MMA1 splice variants were preferably
expressed in the most advanced stage, malignant melanoma.

GENE STRUCTURE

De Wit et al. (2002) determined that the DSCR8 gene contains 4 exons and
spans 35 kb. Exon 1 is noncoding.

De Wit et al. (2005) determined that the promoter region of the DSCR8
gene lacks a conventional TATA box or CAAT site, but it contains
putative binding sites for several transcription factors. A CpG island
overlaps the promoter region and exon 1. Exon 3 contains an Alu element.

Dunn et al. (2006) identified a bidirectional promoter between the DSCR4
and DSCR8 genes, which are transcribed in opposite directions. Their
transcription initiation sites and first exons map within a composite
endogenous retrovirus (ERV) element, where an ERV1 long terminal repeat
(LTR) was inserted into and split an older ERV-L LTR. Both genes are
rich in repetitive sequences throughout their lengths: exon 2 of DSCR4
is derived entirely from an ERV-LTR, while DSCR8 exon 2 contains a short
MIR fragment, and DSCR8 exon 3 is entirely derived from an Alu element.
The LTR of the bidirectional promoter contains 2 putative SP1
(189906)-binding sites and a cAMP response element, and it was highly
active in functional studies, showing multiple positive and negative
regulatory elements.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, de Wit et al. (2002) mapped the DSCR8 gene
to chromosome 21q22.2.

;;PRIP-INTERACTING PROTEIN WITH METHYLTRANSFERASE DOMAIN; PIMT;;
NUCLEAR RECEPTOR COACTIVATOR 6; NCOA6IP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Nuclear receptor coactivators participate in the transcriptional
activation of specific genes by nuclear receptors. Zhu et al. (2001)
isolated a nuclear receptor coactivator-interacting protein, designated
PIMT, from a human liver cDNA library by using the coactivator
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-interacting protein (PRIP;
605299) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen. The PIMT cDNA encodes an
852-amino acid protein containing a 9-amino acid methyltransferase motif
I (VVDAFCGVG) and an invariant segment (GXXGXXI) found in K-homology
motifs of many RNA-binding proteins. Northern blot analysis demonstrated
ubiquitous expression of a 3.2-kb PIMT transcript, with highest
expression in heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, liver, and placenta.
Immunofluorescence studies showed that the PIMT and PRIP proteins are
colocalized in the nucleus. PIMT binds 5-adenosyl-L-methionine, the
methyl donor for the methyltransfer reaction, and it also binds RNA,
suggesting that it is an RNA methyltransferase. Overexpression of PIMT
enhances the transcriptional activity of PPARG (601487) and RXR (see
180245), and this enhancement is further stimulated by overexpression of
PRIP, suggesting that PIMT is a component of nuclear receptor signal
transduction that acts through PRIP.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhu et al. (2001) determined that the PIMT gene contains more than 13
exons and spans more than 40 kb.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Zhu et al. (2001) mapped the PIMT gene to
chromosome 8q11.

114080	TITLE *114080 CALCIUM/CALMODULIN-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE IV; CAMK4
;;BRAIN Ca(2+)/CALMODULIN-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE TYPE IV
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Protein phosphorylation, a prominent activity in the brain, apparently
plays an important role in several neural functions such as neural
transmitter release, ion channel modulation, and axoplasmic transport.
Sikela et al. (1989) identified cDNA clones corresponding to a brain
Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, which they referred to as
brain CaM kinase IV (CAMK4). On the basis of Western blot analysis, this
kinase appeared to be restricted to brain in the rat; interestingly, it
was not detected in the brain of the newborn, but became detectable
within a few days after birth.

By immunostaining of adult mouse brain sections, Wei et al. (2002) found
Camk4-labeled neurons in the hippocampus, amygdala, anterior cingulate
cortex, somatosensory cortex, and insular cortex.

MAPPING

By Southern blot analysis, Sikela et al. (1989) showed that the CAMK4
gene is present in single copy in the mouse and human genomes. Analysis
of DNA from hybrid cells showed that the gene is located on human
chromosome 5, and in situ hybridization indicated that the location is
5q21-q23. By Southern blot analysis of Chinese hamster/mouse somatic
cell hybrids, Sikela et al. (1990) demonstrated that the homologous
mouse locus, Camk4, maps to chromosome 18. Analysis of interspecific
backcrosses positioned Camk4 in the centromeric region near 2 mutations
known to affect neurologic function and fertility. Sikela et al. (1990)
raised the possibility that a defect in Camk4 may be responsible for 1
of these mutant phenotypes.

GENE FUNCTION

Koga et al. (2012) found that knockdown of CAMK4 via small interfering
RNA in T cells from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE;
152700) resulted in augmentation of the percentage of CD25 (IL2RA;
147730)-positive/FOXP3 (300292)-positive regulatory T cells. They
concluded that CAMK4 is important in the generation and function of
regulatory T cells in patients with SLE.

ANIMAL MODEL

Camk4 is a multifunctional serine/threonine protein kinase with limited
tissue distribution that has been implicated in transcriptional
regulation in lymphocytes, neurons, and male germ cells. In the mouse
testis, however, Camk4 is expressed in spermatids and associated with
chromatin and nuclear matrix. Elongating spermatids are not
transcriptionally active, raising the possibility that Camk4 has a novel
function in male germ cells. To investigate the role of Camk4 in
spermatogenesis, Wu et al. (2000) generated mice with a targeted
deletion of the Camk4 gene. Male Camk4 -/- mice were infertile with
impairment of spermiogenesis in late elongating spermatids. The
sequential deposition of sperm basic nuclear proteins on chromatin was
disrupted, with a specific loss of protamine-2 (182890) and prolonged
retention of transition protein-2 (190232) in step-15 spermatids.
Protamine-2 is phosphorylated by Camk4 in vitro, implicating a
connection between Camk4 signaling and the exchange of basic nuclear
proteins in mammalian male germ cells. Defects in protamine-2 have been
identified in sperm of infertile men, suggesting that the results of Wu
et al. (2000) may have clinical implications for the understanding of
human male infertility.

CAMK4 is implicated in the regulation of CRE-dependent transcription. To
investigate the role of this kinase in neuronal plasticity and memory,
Kang et al. (2001) generated transgenic mice in which the expression of
a dominant-negative form of Camk4 was restricted to the postnatal
forebrain. In these transgenic mice, activity-induced Creb (123810)
phosphorylation and Fos (164810) expression were significantly
attenuated. Hippocampal late long-term potentiation (LTP) was also
impaired, whereas basic synaptic function and early LTP were unaffected.
These deficits correlated with impairments in long-term memory,
specifically in its consolidation/retention phase but not in the
acquisition phase. The results indicated that neural activity-dependent
CAMK4 signaling in the neuronal nucleus plays an important role in the
consolidation/retention of hippocampus-dependent long-term memory.

Wei et al. (2002) studied pain and fear memory in Camk4-null mice.
Behavioral responses to an acute noxious stimulus or to prolonged injury
were identical in wildtype and Camk4-null mice, but fear memory was
significantly reduced in the absence of Camk4. Brain sections of
wildtype mice following fear conditioning showed phospho-Creb
immunoreactivity, indicating Creb activation, in memory-related areas
including the hippocampal CA1 region, basolateral amygdala, anterior
cingulate cortex, primary somatosensory cortex, and agranular insular
cortex. Brain sections of Camk4 -/- mice showed no evidence of
fear-induced phospho-Creb in the somatosensory cortex and insular cortex
and lower levels of phospho-Creb in the anterior cingulate cortex.
Electrophysiologic studies indicated that Camk4 contributes to synaptic
potentiation. Stimulation of brain slices induced significant synaptic
potentiation in the anterior cingulate cortex, insular cortex, and
somatosensory cortex of wildtype mice, but reduced or blocked
potentiation in Camk4 -/- mice. Camk4 was also found to be required for
calmodulin (see 114180) translocation in response to KCl application in
the hippocampus, amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, somatosensory
cortex, and insular cortex. Wei et al. (2002) concluded that Camk4 is
crucial in the trapping of Ca(2+)/calmodulin complexes in neuronal
nuclei and in Creb phosphorylation and activation.

CAMK4 expression is developmentally regulated in T lymphocytes and is
highest in CD4 (186940)-positive/CD8 (see 186910)-positive thymocytes.
Using flow cytometric analysis, Raman et al. (2001) showed that
thymocytes from mice lacking Camk4 had impaired thymocyte maturation,
particularly in positive selection, and defective calcium-dependent gene
transcription.

Wu et al. (2002) generated transgenic mice that selectively express in
skeletal muscle a constitutively active form of
calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-4. Skeletal muscles from
these mice showed augmented mDNA replication and mitochondrial
biogenesis, upregulation of mitochondrial enzymes involved in fatty acid
metabolism and electron transport, and reduced susceptibility to fatigue
during repetitive contractions. CAMK induced expression of peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 (PGC1; 604517), a
master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis in vivo, and activated the
PGC1 gene promoter in cultured myocytes. Thus, Wu et al. (2002)
concluded that a calcium-regulated signaling pathway controls
mitochondrial biogenesis in mammalian cells.

MRL/lpr mice have decreased Il2 (147680) production and develop an
SLE-like disease. By RT-PCR analysis, Koga et al. (2012) showed that T
cells from MRL/lpr mice had increased nuclear Camk4. MRL/lpr mice
lacking Camk4 had significantly prolonged survival, restoration of Cd4
T-cell Il2 production, and increased numbers of
Cd4-positive/Cd25-positive/Foxp3-positive regulatory T cells. Koga et
al. (2012) concluded that Camk4 is important in the generation and
function of regulatory T cells in lupus-prone mice.

300230	TITLE *300230 CARBONIC ANHYDRASE VB, MITOCHONDRIAL; CA5B
;;CA VB
DESCRIPTION Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) are a family of zinc metalloenzymes. For
background information on the CA family, see 114800.

By negative screening of RT-PCR-derived cDNA clones of pancreas and
salivary gland tissue with cDNA probes corresponding to CA2 (611492),
CA4 (114760), and CA6 (114780), followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE,
Fujikawa-Adachi et al. (1999) obtained a cDNA encoding a member of the
CA family, which they termed CA5B. CA5B encodes a 317-amino acid protein
that has 64% sequence similarity with CA5 (114761), a mitochondrial CA,
and contains a 33-amino-acid residue signal sequence. Western blot
analysis revealed a 36-kD protein precursor and a 32-kD mature protein.
Endoglycosidase treatment did not affect the size of the protein.
Western blot analysis with cell fractionation and confocal fluorescence
microscopy showed specific localization in mitochondria. Like CA5, CA5B
is a low activity enzyme with a sensitivity to acetazolamide. Northern
blot analysis revealed a wider tissue distribution than that for CA5,
with expression of 4 different-sized transcripts (1.3, 2.6, 4.4, and 6.0
kb) in all tissues examined except liver, with strongest expression in
heart, pancreas, kidney, placenta, lung, and skeletal muscle. By RT-PCR
analysis, CA5B was expressed in pancreas, kidney, salivary glands, and
spinal cord, but not in liver, whereas CA5 was expressed in liver only.

By FISH, Fujikawa-Adachi et al. (1999) mapped the CA5B gene to Xp22.1.

Shah et al. (2000) identified a mouse mitochondrial carbonic anhydrase,
called type VB, by homology to the previously characterized murine CA
VA. Shah et al. (2000) found that the carbonic anhydrase domain sequence
of human VB shows much higher conservation between mouse and human (95%
identity) than the CA domains of mouse and human VA (78% identity).
Analysis of phylogenetic relationships between these and other available
human and mouse CA isozyme sequences revealed that mammalian CA VB
evolved much more slowly than CA VA, accepting amino acid substitutions
at least 4.5 times more slowly since each evolved from its respective
human-mouse ancestral gene around 90 million years ago. Both the
differences in tissue distribution and the much greater evolutionary
constraints on CA VB sequences suggested that the 2 forms of
mitochondrial carbonic anhydrase evolved to assume different physiologic
roles.

610520	TITLE *610520 CD300 ANTIGEN-LIKE FAMILY, MEMBER G; CD300LG
;;TRIGGERING RECEPTOR EXPRESSED ON MYELOID CELLS 4; TREM4;;
CLM9;;
NEPMUCIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the CD300 (see 606786)-like (CD300L) family, such as CD300LG,
are widely expressed on hematopoietic cells. All CD300L proteins are
type I cell surface glycoproteins that contain a single immunoglobulin
(Ig) V-like domain (Takatsu et al., 2006).

CLONING

By searching EST databases for novel Ig domain-containing Fc receptors
for IgA (e.g., FCAMR; 605484), Takatsu et al. (2006) identified mouse
and human CD300LG. Both genes encode at least 4 isoforms. The predicted
human proteins contain 222, 233, 298, and 332 amino acids, and all 4
have a signal peptide, an Ig domain, a transmembrane domain, and
cytoplasmic tail that is shorter than that found in the mouse Cd300lg
isoforms. Northern blot analysis detected a major 3-kb CD300LG
transcript that was highly expressed in human heart, skeletal muscle,
and placenta and weakly expressed in most other tissues examined; no
expression was detected in brain. Immunohistochemical and immunoelectron
microscopy analysis demonstrated expression of mouse Cd300lg on apical
and basolateral plasma membranes of capillary endothelial cells.

Umemoto et al. (2006) cloned mouse Cd300lg, which they called nepmucin.
All 4 isoforms of mouse nepmucin contain a central mucin (see
158340)-like domain. Nepmucin protein was expressed on the luminal
surface of high endothelial venules (HEVs) in lymph nodes, but not on
HEVs of Peyer patches.

GENE FUNCTION

Using assays in canine kidney cells, Takatsu et al. (2006) demonstrated
that human CD300LG was transcytosed in a bidirectional manner.
Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that HeLa cells expressing mouse or
human CD300LG could take up human IgA2 and mouse IgM efficiently,
suggesting that IgA and IgM may be candidate CD300LG ligands.

Umemoto et al. (2006) found that the mucin-like domain of mouse nepmucin
mediated L-selectin (SELL; 153240)-dependent lymphocyte rolling under
physiologic conditions. Under static conditions, nepmucin bound
lymphocytes through its Ig domain, and it promoted shear-resistant
lymphocyte binding in combination with Icam1 (147840) under flow
conditions.

GENE STRUCTURE

Takatsu et al. (2006) determined that the CD300LG gene contains 9 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Takatsu et al. (2006) mapped the CD300LG
gene to chromosome 17q21. They mapped the mouse gene to chromosome 11D.

G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR 92; GPR92;;
GPR93
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs, or GPRs) contain 7 transmembrane
domains and transduce extracellular signals through heterotrimeric G
proteins.

CLONING

Lee et al. (2001) identified GPR92, which they designated GPR93, in a
genomic database using the sequences of the cysteinyl leukotriene-2
receptor (605666) as query. GPR92 encodes a deduced 372-amino acid
protein that shares 36 to 40% sequence identity in the transmembrane
regions with the G protein-coupled purinergic receptor P2Y5 (P2RY5;
609239), GPR23 (300086), and GPR17 (603071).

MAPPING

Lee et al. (2001) mapped the GPR92 gene to chromosome 12 based on
sequence similarity between the GPR92 sequence and a BAC clone (GenBank
GENBANK AC006087) localized to chromosome 12. White et al. (2000)
identified GPR92 near the FGF23 gene on chromosome 12p13.

194558	TITLE *194558 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 83; ZNF83
DESCRIPTION 
MAPPING

Marine et al. (1994) assigned the ZNF83 gene (also known as HPF1) to
chromosome 19 by screening a human/rodent hybrid panel and localized the
gene further to 19q13.3-q13.4 by fluorescence in situ hybridization and
digital imaging microscopy.

HISTORY

Conserved structural motifs define large families of nucleic acid
binding proteins in eukaryotes. The C2H2-type zinc finger motif,
conferring both specific RNA and DNA binding activities, was first
detected within the amino acid sequence of the Xenopus transcription
factor IIIA (Miller et al., 1985). Thereafter, vertebrate genomes were
shown to encode hundreds of so-called zinc finger proteins (ZFPs).
Subfamilies were defined on the basis of conserved sequence elements
outside the finger repeat, such as the KRAB domain. Several members of
these subfamilies were found to have a clustered genomic organization.

116946	TITLE *116946 CELL DIVISION CYCLE 27; CDC27
;;ANAPHASE-PROMOTING COMPLEX, SUBUNIT 3; APC3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CDC27 is 1 of several subunits of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC),
which functions at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition of the cell
cycle and is regulated by spindle checkpoint proteins. The APC is an E3
ubiquitin ligase that targets cell cycle regulatory proteins for
degradation by the proteasome, thereby allowing progression through the
cell cycle (summary by Jorgensen et al., 2001).

CLONING

Tugendreich et al. (1993) described a strategy for quickly identifying
and positionally mapping human homologs of yeast genes in order to
cross-reference the rich biologic and genetic information concerning
yeast genes to mammalian species. Optimized computer search methods were
developed to scan the rapidly expanding expressed sequence tag (EST)
database of Venter and colleagues (Adams et al., 1992) to find human
open reading frames related to yeast protein sequences. The
corresponding human cDNA was then used to obtain a high-resolution map
position on human and mouse chromosomes, providing the links between
yeast genetic analysis and mapped mammalian loci. In this way,
Tugendreich et al. (1993) identified a human homolog of CDC27 of
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Human CDC27 encodes an 823-amino acid protein
with global similarity to its fungal homologs.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a library of endoribonuclease-prepared short interfering RNAs
(esiRNAs), Kittler et al. (2004) identified 37 genes required for cell
division, one of which was CDC27. These 37 genes included several
splicing factors for which knockdown generates mitotic spindle defects.
In addition, a putative nuclear-export terminator was found to speed up
cell proliferation and mitotic progression after knockdown.

MAPPING

Tugendreich et al. (1993) mapped the CDC27 gene to human chromosome 17
and mouse chromosome 11 between the PKCA gene (176960) at 17q22-q23.2
and the ERBB2 gene (164870) at 17q12-q21. The assignment to human
chromosome 17 was achieved by PCR analysis of a panel of somatic cell
hybrids; the mapping to chromosome 11 between the murine homologs of the
PKCA and ERBB2 genes was done by linkage analysis. That CDC27 is located
between these genes in the human was inferred from the strong homology
of synteny.

606767	TITLE *606767 POTASSIUM CHANNEL, VOLTAGE-GATED, SUBFAMILY G, MEMBER 3; KCNG3
;;KV6.3;;
KV10.1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Voltage-gated potassium channels play an essential role in controlling
cellular excitability in the nervous system. These channels are
multimeric proteins containing alpha subunits, which are directly
responsible for channel activity, and gamma subunits, which modify the
basic channel activity. Kv6.3 functions as a gamma subunit.

CLONING

Using primers derived from a genomic fragment showing homology to Kv6.2
(605696), Sano et al. (2002) cloned Kv6.3 from a human brain cDNA
library. Kv6.3 encodes a deduced 437-amino acid sequence with a
predicted molecular mass of 49 kD. It shares 34% sequence identity with
Kv6.2 and 95.1% identity with the rat ortholog, Kv6.3. The protein
contains a pore forming domain and 6 transmembrane domains. RT-PCR
analysis demonstrated high expression of human Kv6.3 in various regions
of the brain. RT-PCR analysis in rat demonstrated that Kv6.3 is
specifically expressed in neuronal cells.

By PCR, Ottschytsch et al. (2002) cloned KCNG3, which they called
Kv10.1, from a brain cDNA library. The deduced protein contains 436
amino acids. PCR analysis detected strongest expression in pancreas and
testis and lower levels in brain, lung, kidney, thymus, ovary, small
intestine, and colon.

GENE FUNCTION

By coimmunoprecipitation studies, Sano et al. (2002) demonstrated
interaction between Kv6.3 and Kv2.1 (600397) in cotransfected COS-7
cells. Electrophysiologic analysis of transiently transfected murine
fibroblasts showed that Kv6.3 does not form a functional voltage-gated
ion channel when expressed alone. When Kv6.3 is coexpressed with Kv2.1,
a heteromultimeric channel is formed that shows a decreased rate of
deactivation compared to the channel formed by Kv2.1 alone. Thus, Kv6.3
appears to function as a modulatory subunit.

Ottschytsch et al. (2002) found no potassium currents when KCNG3 was
expressed alone, while coexpression with Kv2.1 in mouse fibroblasts
resulted in altered Kv2.1 channel properties. By yeast 2-hybrid analysis
using the N-terminal segment of KCNG3 containing the NAB domain, which
regulates coassembly, Ottschytsch et al. (2002) found no
homotetramerization between KCNG3 molecules. Immunoprecipitation
analysis using full-length proteins confirmed interaction between KCNG3
and Kv2.1. By confocal microscopy, Ottschytsch et al. (2002) showed that
KCNG3 was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum when expressed alone,
and it redistributed to the plasma membrane when expressed with Kv2.1.
Ottschytsch et al. (2002) concluded that Kv2.1 promotes the trafficking
of KCNG3 and other regulatory subunits to the cell surface, presumably
by forming heterotetrameric channels.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sano et al. (2002) determined that the Kv6.3 gene contains 2 exons
spanning 49 kb of genomic DNA.

MAPPING

Sano et al. (2002) mapped the Kv6.3 gene within a genomic clone
localized to chromosome 2. By genomic sequence analysis, Ottschytsch et
al. (2002) mapped the KCNG3 gene to chromosome 2p21.

investigators

605660	TITLE *605660 PREFOLDIN 6; PFDN6
;;KE2, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; HKE2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PFDN6 is a subunit of the heteromeric prefoldin complex that chaperones
nascent actin (see 102560) and alpha- and beta-tubulin (see 602529 and
191130, respectively) chains pending their transfer to the cytosolic
chaperonin containing TCP1 (186980) (CCT) complex (Hansen et al., 1999).

CLONING

A number of diseases are influenced by genes at the centromeric end of
the major histocompatibility complex (see 142800) on chromosome 6p21.3.
Herberg et al. (1998) cloned and characterized genes, including HKE2, in
the 70-kb, gene-dense segment flanking the tapasin (TAPBP; 601962) gene.
The 129-amino acid HKE2 protein is identical to the mouse Ke2 sequence
apart from the insertion of 2 residues at position 122.

Vainberg et al. (1998) purified the prefoldin heterohexameric chaperone
from bovine testis and, by database analysis, they identified Pfdn6 in
several species, including mouse. The deduced mouse protein contains 127
amino acids.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a mouse antibody directed against PFDN6 to follow the prefoldin
complex, Hansen et al. (1999) showed that prefoldin is involved in
chaperoning nascent chains of the cytoskeletal proteins actin,
alpha-tubulin, and beta-tubulin in HeLa cells and rabbit reticulocyte
lysates. Prefoldin bound to actin chains after synthesis of the
N-terminal 130 to 140 amino acids and to beta-tubulin after synthesis of
about 250 amino acids. Prefoldin remained bound to the relatively
unfolded actin and tubulin polypeptides until delivery of the
full-length proteins to CCT for folding to their native states.

GENE STRUCTURE

Herberg et al. (1998) determined that the PFDN6 gene contains 4 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Herberg et al. (1998) mapped the PFDN6
gene to chromosome 6p21.3.

138971	TITLE *138971 COLONY-STIMULATING FACTOR 3 RECEPTOR, GRANULOCYTE; CSF3R
;;GRANULOCYTE COLONY-STIMULATING FACTOR RECEPTOR; GCSFR
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor or CSF3 (138970), is a
glycoprotein of MW 20,000-25,000 that is produced by macrophages
stimulated with endotoxin. It plays an important role in granulopoiesis
during the inflammatory process. CSF3 exerts its biologic effects
through interaction with specific cell-surface receptors. Binding
studies with radiolabeled CSF3 indicated that CSF3 receptor is expressed
not only by progenitor and mature neutrophilic granulocytes, but also by
nonhematopoietic cells such as placental cells, endothelial cells, and
various carcinoma cell lines. Fukunaga et al. (1990) cloned and
characterized cDNAs for human CSF3 receptor. They found that it is
abundantly expressed in the human placenta. The receptor contains 813
amino acids and shows marked homology (62.5%) with its murine
counterpart. It was found to consist of extracellular, transmembrane,
and cytoplasmic domains. Two other classes of the human CSF3 receptor
were identified, one of which had a deletion of the transmembrane domain
and seemed to represent a secreted, soluble receptor. The third class
contained a 27-amino acid insertion in the cytoplasmic domain and was
highly expressed in the placenta.

Seto et al. (1992) found that CSF3R is subdivided into several regions:
an Ig-like domain, a cytokine receptor homologous domain, 3 fibronectin
type III domains, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic region. No
canonical 'TATA' box was found upstream of the cap site. About 110 bp
upstream of the transcription initiation site, an 18-bp element was
found that is homologous to sequences found in the promoter of human
myeloperoxidase (606989) and neutrophil elastase (130120) genes.

GENE FUNCTION

Dong et al. (2001) reported that the C terminus of CSF3R is required for
SHP1 (176883) downregulation of CSF3-induced STAT activation. The
authors proposed that this mechanism inhibits cell proliferation and
survival in response to CSF3.

GENE STRUCTURE

Seto et al. (1992) found that the CSF3R gene consists of 17 exons.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization using human CSF3R cDNA as a probe, Inazawa et
al. (1991) localized the gene to 1p35-p34.3. The localization on
chromosome 1 was confirmed by 2 further methods: the use of
oligonucleotides specific for human CSF3R for PCR amplification of DNA
from mouse A9 cells that contained chromosome 1 as the only human
chromosome; and spot-blot hybridization of sorted human chromosomes.
Tweardy et al. (1992) assigned the gene to the distal short arm of human
chromosome 1 by Southern blot analysis of its segregation pattern in a
panel of rodent-human hybrid DNAs. By chromosomal in situ hybridization,
they refined the localization to 1p34-p32 and concluded that the gene is
located telomeric to the CSF1 (120420), JUN (165160), and TCL5 (187040)
genes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Dong et al. (1994) identified a somatic point mutation in the GCSFR gene
as the cause of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in a patient with severe
congenital neutropenia (202700). Dong et al. (1995) described somatic
mutations in the GCSFR gene in 2 males with acute myeloid leukemia
preceded by severe congenital neutropenia. In 1 patient, the mutation
was also found in the neutropenic stage, before the progression to acute
myeloid leukemia. Transfection of the cDNA encoding the mutant GCSF
receptor into mouse cells resulted in abnormally high proliferative
responses but failure to mature when cultured in GCSF. The mutant
receptors also interfered with terminal maturation mediated by the
wildtype GCSF receptor and the murine cells that coexpressed the
wildtype and mutant receptors, an apparent dominant-negative effect.

Tidow et al. (1997) investigated the frequency of these specific
mutations in patients with congenital neutropenia undergoing treatment
with recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor
(Filgrastim). The critical region (nucleotides 2384-2429) from the
intracellular domain of the GCSFR gene was studied in both genomic DNA
and cDNA from neutrophils and mononuclear cells from 28 patients with
severe congenital neutropenia. In 4 of the patients, a point mutation in
the tested cytoplasmic region of the GCSFR gene was found. The point
mutations replaced a glutamine codon by a stop codon. Among these 4
congenital neutropenia patients with a mutated GCSFR gene, 2 developed
AML. All 4 patients were investigated regularly and no correlation
between occurrence of GCSFR mutation and time or dose of Filgrastim was
found. No point mutations in the GCSFR critical domain could be detected
in cells from the other 24 congenital neutropenia patients. Furthermore,
Tidow et al. (1997) tested 6 family members of the 2 patients with AML,
including mothers and fathers, 1 sister, and 1 brother who also suffered
from congenital neutropenia. All family members had a normal GCSFR gene.
After the acquisition of the GCSFR mutations, the congenital neutropenia
patients continued to respond to G-CSFR therapy with an increase in
absolute neutrophils in the peripheral blood. Tidow et al. (1997)
concluded that the point mutations in the critical region of the
intracellular part of the G-CSF receptor occur spontaneously and are not
inherited. They suggested, furthermore, that the described point
mutations do not alter the response to treatment and are not the cause
of severe congenital neutropenia.

Dale et al. (2000) quoted prevalence data suggesting that a minority of
patients with congenital neutropenia show mutations in GCSFR. On the
other hand, mutations in the neutrophil elastase gene (ELA2; 130130)
have been identified in a majority of these patients. Dale et al. (2000)
suggested that it is much more likely that mutations in the ELA2 gene
compromise myeloid differentiation and create a risk for development of
acute myeloid leukemia.

In a 3-generation family segregating autosomal dominant neutrophilia
(162830), Plo et al. (2009) sequenced the CSF3R gene and identified a
heterozygous mutation (T617N; 138971.0001) in all 12 affected
individuals that was not found in the 4 unaffected family members. The
mutation disappeared after remission and was not detected at relapse,
indicating that the T617N mutation was a secondary event in the leukemic
process. The T617N mutation had previously been reported as an acquired
activating mutation in 2 of 555 patients with acute myeloid leukemia by
Forbes et al. (2002).

Maxson et al. (2013) identified activating mutations in the CSF3R gene
in 16 of 27 patients (59%) with chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL) or
atypical (BCR-ABL1-negative; see 608232) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).
These mutations segregated within 2 distinct regions of CSF3R and led to
preferential downstream kinase signaling through SRC family (see
190090)-TNK2 (606994) or JAK kinases and differential sensitivity to
kinase inhibitors. A patient with CNL carrying a JAK-activating CSF3R
mutation had marked clinical improvement after the administration of the
JAK1/2 (see 147795) inhibitor ruxolitinib.

ANIMAL MODEL

Despite the demonstration of mutations in CSF3R, their role in the
pathogenesis of SCN and the subsequent development of acute myeloid
leukemia remained controversial. McLemore et al. (1998) generated mice
carrying a targeted mutation in their Csf3r gene that reproduced a
mutation found in a patient with SCN and AML reported by Dong et al.
(1995). They found that the mutant Csf3r allele was expressed in a
myeloid-specific fashion at levels comparable to the wildtype allele.
Mice heterozygous or homozygous for this mutation had normal levels of
circulating neutrophils and no evidence for a block in myeloid
maturation, indicating that resting granulopoiesis was normal. However,
in response to GCSF treatment, these mice demonstrated a significantly
greater increase in the level of circulating neutrophils. This effect
appeared to be due to increased neutrophil production. Furthermore, the
in vitro survival and GCSF-dependent suppression of apoptosis of mutant
neutrophils were normal. Despite this evidence for a hyperproliferative
response to GCSF, no cases of AML were detected. McLemore et al. (1998)
interpreted the results as providing strong evidence that mutations in
the CSF3R gene are not responsible for the impaired granulopoiesis
present in patients with SCN.

Schweizerhof et al. (2009) presented evidence that GCSF and GMCSF (CSF2;
138960) mediate bone cancer pain and tumor-nerve interactions. Increased
levels of both factors were detected in bone marrow lysates and
adjoining connective tissue in a mouse sarcoma model of bone
tumor-induced pain compared to controls. The functional receptors GCSFR
and GMCSFR (CSF2RA; 306250) were expressed on peripheral nerves in the
bone matrix and in dorsal root ganglia. GMCSF sensitized nerves to
mechanical stimuli in vitro and in vivo, potentiated CGRP (114130)
release, and caused sprouting of sensory nerve endings in the skin. RNA
interference of GCSF and GMCSF signaling in mouse sarcoma model led to
reduced tumor growth and nerve remodeling, and abrogated bone cancer
pain.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
NEUTROPHILIA, HEREDITARY
CSF3R, THR617ASN

In 12 affected members of a 3-generation family segregating autosomal
dominant hereditary neutrophilia (162830), Plo et al. (2009) identified
heterozygosity for a 2088C-A transversion in the CSF3R gene, resulting
in a thr617-to-asn (T617N) substitution located in the transmembrane
domain of the receptor. The mutation disappeared after remission and was
not detected at relapse, indicating that the T617N mutation was a
secondary event in the leukemic process. Computational analysis by Plo
et al. (2009) indicated that T617N strongly favors dimerization of the
receptor transmembrane domain, and studies in CD34+ cells from patients
and controls demonstrated constitutive activation of the mutant receptor
with hypersensitivity to GCSF. Mutant hematopoietic stem cells yielded a
myeloproliferative-like disorder in xenotransplantation and syngenic
mouse bone marrow engraftment assays. The T617N mutation had previously
been reported as an acquired activating mutation in 2 of 555 patients
with acute myeloid leukemia by Forbes et al. (2002).

;;RING FINGER PROTEIN 21; RNF21;;
INTERFERON-RESPONSIVE FINGER PROTEIN 1; IFP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

RING finger proteins play crucial roles in differentiation, development,
oncogenesis, and apoptosis. Although RING finger domains are involved in
protein-protein interactions and typically bind zinc, they are distinct
from zinc finger domains in terms of sequence and structure. Using PCR
with degenerate primers to generate probes for novel RING finger
proteins, followed by screening placenta and ovary cDNA libraries, Orimo
et al. (2000) isolated cDNAs encoding 3 isoforms of RNF21. The deduced
842-amino acid long form contains 2 RING finger domains, 2 RING finger
B-box coiled-coil (RBCC) domains, and a C-terminal B30.2 domain. The
488-amino acid medium form has 1 of each of these domains, whereas the
270-amino acid short form has a RING finger domain and a RBCC domain but
lacks the B30.2 domain. Immunoblot analysis detected 98-, 54-, and 31-kD
proteins. RT-PCR analysis indicated that each isoform is expressed in
placenta and testis. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a
4-kb transcript predominantly in testis and a 2.4-kb transcript that was
highly expressed in placenta, spleen, colon, and blood leukocytes. The
long form was expressed only in testis, kidney, and ovary. Expression of
the medium form was upregulated in response to alpha-interferon (see
147660) and, later, to gamma-interferon (147570).

MAPPING

By FISH, Orimo et al. (2000) mapped the RNF21 gene to 11p15.4-p15.3.

;;HPAII TINY FRAGMENTS LOCUS 9C; HTF9C
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Guarguaglini et al. (1997) cloned mouse Htf9c, which encodes a deduced
676-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 75 kD. Htf9c
has a putative N-terminal nuclear targeting signal and a C-terminal
domain similar to yeast and bacterial nucleic acid-modifying enzymes.

GENE FUNCTION

Guarguaglini et al. (1997) found that mouse Htf9c and Ranbp1 (601180)
were divergently transcribed from a bidirectional promoter. Expression
of both genes was activated upon entry into the cell cycle, peaked in S
phase, and was downregulated during completion of the cell cycle. The
bidirectional promoter was downregulated in both orientations in
arrested cells. Activation of the promoter was specific, resulting in
more restricted Htf9c expression and a sharper peak of Htf9c expression
in S phase compared with Ranbp1 expression. A region containing an E2f
(189971) site was important for cell cycle control of Htf9c, and a
common region containing sites for Sp1 (189906) and E2f contributed to
activation in both orientations.

MAPPING

Hartz (2007) mapped the HTF9C gene to chromosome 22q11.21 based on an
alignment of the TRMT2A sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK025106) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

611373	TITLE *611373 LIVER-EXPRESSED ANTIMICROBIAL PEPTIDE 2; LEAP2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

LEAP2 is a cysteine-rich cationic antimicrobial peptide (Krause et al.,
2003).

CLONING

By database analysis using partial sequence of a cysteine-rich peptide
purified from a human blood ultrafiltrate peptide library as probe,
Krause et al. (2003) identified LEAP2 genomic and cDNA sequences and
several possible splice variants. The deduced 77-amino acid precursor
protein contains an N-terminal secretory signal sequence and 4 cysteine
residues forming 2 disulfide bonds and shares 83% sequence similarity to
the mouse Leap2 precursor protein. The putative mature LEAP2 peptide
(amino acids 38-77) is identical to that of mouse. LEAP2 shares the
structural features of positively charged amino acid residues and
multiple disulfides with other antimicrobial peptides such as the
defensins (see DEFB4, 602215) and LEAP1/hepcidin (HAMP; 606464).
Northern blot analysis detected multiple LEAP2 transcripts in human
liver and kidney, with possible faint expression in other tissues.
Real-time quantitative RT-PCR specific for the major LEAP2 transcript
(LEAP2-350) and an intron-1 retaining transcript (LEAP2-550) detected
tissue-specific expression. The highest expression of LEAP2-350 was
found in liver, kidney, jejunum, and duodenum, with lower expression in
antrum, brain, bladder, testis, heart, lung, and colon, and very low
expression in other tissues examined. The highest expression of
LEAP2-550 was found in kidney, followed by brain, liver, heart, and
lung, with lower expression in prostate, trachea, and other tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Using chemically synthesized LEAP2 peptide in zone inhibition assay and
dose-response colony formation unit assays, Krause et al. (2003) showed
that LEAP2 displayed dose-dependent antimicrobial activity against
numerous Gram-positive bacteria and yeasts. The half-maximal inhibitory
activity (IC-50) of LEAP2 was -5 microM against S. cerevisiae and B.
subtilis, corresponding to the activity of other antimicrobial peptides
on a molar basis. LEAP2 had no antimicrobial activity against
Gram-negative bacteria.

GENE STRUCTURE

Krause et al. (2003) determined that the LEAP2 gene contains 3 exons,
with several possible alternatively spliced forms, including an intron-1
retaining transcript (LEAP2-550).

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis and radiation hybrid analysis, Krause et
al. (2003) mapped the LEAP2 gene to chromosome 5q31. They mapped the
mouse Leap2 gene to a region of syntenic homology on chromosome 11.

614405	TITLE *614405 DEAH BOX POLYPEPTIDE 33; DHX33
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the DEAD/DEAH box family of RNA helicases, such as DHX33,
modify the higher-order structure of RNA through hydrolysis of ATP or
other nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs). These enzymes have a role in RNA
transcription, RNA editing, pre-mRNA splicing, ribosome biogenesis, and
RNA decay (summary by Zhang et al., 2011).

CLONING

Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is transcribed by RNA polymerase I (see POLR1B;
602000) as a 47S polycistronic precursor that is processed into mature
18S, 5.8S, and 28S rRNAs. Using an RNA interference screen to identify
DDX/DHX enzymes that perturb rRNA transcription in human fibroblasts,
Zhang et al. (2011) identified DHX33. The deduced protein contains an
N-terminal ATP/NTP-binding domain, a central ATP/NTPase domain, and
C-terminal helicase and ATP/NTP hydrolysis-dependent substrate
interaction motifs. Fractionation of a human breast cancer cell line and
human and mouse fibroblasts, as well as immunohistochemical analysis,
revealed that DHX33 localized predominantly with markers of nucleoli,
with some localization in nucleoplasm. Following dispersal of nucleoli
during the cell cycle, DHX33 followed nucleolar proteins to nucleolar
organizing regions.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhang et al. (2011) found that knockdown of DHX33 in human cell lines
inhibited rRNA transcription and processing, reduced the size of
nucleoli, caused nucleolar stress, and initiated a p53 (TP53;
191170)-dependent stress response that included cell cycle arrest and
induction of p21 (CDKN1A; 116899). Mutation analysis revealed that lys94
(K94) within the catalytic domain of DHX33 was crucial for rRNA
transcription. DHX33 deficiency reduced recruitment of the large RNA
polymerase subunit RPA194 (POLR1A) to rDNA loci and reduced
phosphorylation of UBF (UBTF; 600673), which is required for RNA
polymerase I activity. Overexpression of wildtype DHX33, but not DHX33
with a K94 mutation, in human cell lines stimulated 47S synthesis.
Overexpression of DHX33 with deletion of its putative DNA-binding domain
also reduced rRNA synthesis. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of
human breast cancer cells revealed that DHX33, like RPA194, occupied the
entire rDNA promoter and transcribed regions, and binding required the
DNA-binding motif of DHX33. DHX33 also immunoprecipitated with UBF.
Zhang et al. (2011) concluded that DHX33 has a critical role in cell
growth and rRNA synthesis.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the DHX33 gene to chromosome 17p13.2 based on an
alignment of the DHX33 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AL359945) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

602327	TITLE *602327 PLECKSTRIN AND SEC7 DOMAINS-CONTAINING PROTEIN; PSD
;;TYL;;
EXCHANGE FACTOR FOR ARF6; EFA6;;
EFA6A
DESCRIPTION Perletti et al. (1997) identified a novel human gene on 10q24,
contiguous to the 3-prime end of the NFKB2 gene (164012) in a
tail-to-tail arrangement. They described a cDNA of 4,307 bp, isolated
from an adult human brain cDNA library, which contains an open reading
frame encoding a putative protein of 645 amino acids with a predicted
molecular weight of 71 kD. Database homology searches indicated that the
novel gene codes for a putative protein containing 2 discrete domains
with significant homology to the Sec7 and pleckstrin-homology (PH)
domains, respectively. They used the gene symbol PSD for
'pleckstrin-Sec7 domains.' Northern blot analysis of a panel of RNAs
from normal human tissues using the PSD cDNA as probe revealed the
presence of 3 different tissue-specific transcripts of approximately
4.3, 2.3, and 1.8 kb, the longest of which was expressed only in brain.
The data suggested that the PSD gene may encode a protein related to the
protein family containing both the Sec7 in the PH domains and thought to
be involved in signaling transduction processes. Other human proteins in
the same family include cytohesin-1 (Kolanus et al., 1996) and ARNO
(602488) (Chardin et al., 1996).

Derrien et al. (2002) reported that PSD, which they called EFA6A, is 63%
identical to EFA6B (PSD4; 614442) and contains a Sec7 domain adjacent to
a PH domain, followed by a C-terminal coiled-coil motif. Northern blot
analysis showed that EFA6A expression was largely restricted to brain,
with a smaller transcript expressed in small intestine, colon, and
ovary. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated punctate cell surface
expression of ARF6 (600464) and EFA6A, like EFA6B, in transfected baby
hamster kidney cells. Both EFA6 proteins also colocalized with F-actin
(see 102610).

GENE FUNCTION

Derrien et al. (2002) found that recombinant EFA6A stimulated nucleotide
exchange on myristoylated ARF6, with only low activity on ARF1 (103180).
The C-terminal region was involved in microvilli lengthening. Derrien et
al. (2002) concluded that EFA6 family guanine exchange factors are
modular proteins that work through the coordinated action of the
catalytic Sec7 domain to promote ARF6 activation, through the PH domain
to regulate association with specific subdomains of the plasma membrane,
and through the C-terminal region to control actin cytoskeletal
reorganization.

MAPPING

Gross (2012) mapped the PSD gene to chromosome 10q24.32 based on an
alignment of the PSD sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC142689) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

608610	TITLE *608610 PROGRAMMED CELL DEATH 4; PDCD4
;;NEOPLASTIC TRANSFORMATION INHIBITOR
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening a glioma cDNA expression library with antibodies raised
against a nuclear protein, Matsuhashi et al. (1997) cloned PDCD4, which
they designated H731. The deduced 458-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 50.6 kD. PDCD4 is an acidic protein with
characteristics of a nuclear nonhistone protein. It contains 2
overlapping GxGxxG nucleotide-binding motifs, which are characteristic
of protein kinases, but it does not have a kinase catalytic domain.
PDCD4 also has several putative serine and threonine phosphorylation
sites. Northern blot analysis detected transcripts of about 2.7 and 3.8
kb in HeLa cell total RNA. Recombinant PDCD4 expressed in E. coli
resulted in proteins with apparent molecular masses of 56 and 37 kD. The
37-kD truncated protein was synthesized from val127, reading the val
codon as an f-met initiation codon.

Yoshinaga et al. (1999) found that PDCD4 accumulated in the nuclei of
confluent or quiescent normal fetal lung fibroblasts, but it was
overproduced and localized in the cytoplasm during the cell cycle in
tumor cell lines. Immunohistologic analysis revealed that PDCD4 was
highly expressed in bladder carcinoma and breast carcinoma tissues
compared with normal tissues. PDCD4 was also abundantly expressed in the
small duct epithelial cells of normal mammary gland.

GENE FUNCTION

By Northern blot and Western blot analyses, Kang et al. (2002)
determined that expression of both the PDCD4 transcript and protein was
upregulated in senescent diploid fibroblasts compared with cells in log
phase growth. Yeast 2-hybrid analysis showed that the C terminus of
PDCD4 could interact with a component of the 40S ribosome complex, RPS13
(180476), and with RPL5 (603634) and TI-227H. In vitro binding assays
confirmed the interaction between PDCD4 and RPS13. In vitro pull-down
assays also showed that PDCD4 interacted with EIF4G (600495), but not
with EIF4E (133440). Furthermore, PDCD4 localized to polysome fractions
of fractionated HeLa cells. Kang et al. (2002) concluded that PDCD4 may
regulate EIF4G-dependent translation through direct interaction with
EIF4G and RPS13 in senescent fibroblasts.

Dorrello et al. (2006) found that the tumor suppressor PDCD4 inhibits
the translation initiation factor EIF4A (see 602641), an RNA helicase
that catalyzes the unwinding of secondary structure at the 5-prime
untranslated region of mRNAs. In response to mitogens, PDCD4 was rapidly
phosphorylated on ser67 by the protein kinase S6K1 (608938) and
subsequently degraded via the ubiquitin ligase SCF-beta(TRCP) (603482).
Expression in cultured cells of a stable PDCD4 mutant that was unable to
bind beta-TRCP inhibited translation of an mRNA with a structured
5-prime untranslated region, resulted in smaller cell size, and slowed
down cell cycle progression. Dorrello et al. (2006) proposed that
regulated degradation of PDCD4 in response to mitogens allows efficient
protein synthesis and consequently cell growth.

PDCD4 contains 2 tandem MA3 domains consisting of conserved
alpha-helical hairpins. Using x-ray crystallography, NMR, and surface
plasmon resonance, Suzuki et al. (2008) found that both MA3 domains of
human PDCD4 were structurally and functionally similar and bound
specifically to the N-terminal domain of EIF4A using similar binding
interfaces. The MA3 domains of PDCD4 competed with the MA3 domain of
EIF4G and RNA for EIF4A binding. Suzuki et al. (2008) concluded that
PDCD4 inhibits translation initiation by displacing EIF4G and RNA from
EIF4A. They proposed that the PDCD4 MA3 domains act synergistically to
form a tighter and more stable complex with EIF4A, explaining the need
for 2 tandem MA3 domains.

Davis et al. (2008) demonstrated that induction of a contractile
phenotype in human vascular smooth muscle cells by TGF-beta (190180) and
BMPs (see 112264) is mediated by miR21 (611020). miR21 downregulates
PDCD4, which in turn acts as a negative regulator of smooth muscle
contractile genes. Davis et al. (2008) concluded that PDCD4 is a
functional target of miR21 involved in the BMP-mediated induction of
smooth muscle cell markers in vascular smooth muscle cells.

Asangani et al. (2008) identified an miR21 target sequence in the
3-prime UTR of PDCD4 and confirmed binding and inhibition of PDCD4 by
miR21 using reporter gene assays. They observed an inverse correlation
between miR21 and PDCD4 expression in 10 colorectal cell lines and in 22
colorectal cancer tissues and matched normal controls. Transfection of
RKO human colorectal cancer cells with anti-miR21 increased PDCD4
protein concentration, reduced the invasive potential of RKO cells in
3-dimensional gels, and reduced intravasation and lung metastasis of RKO
cells in a chicken embryo metastasis assay. Overexpression of miR21
reduced expression of PDCD4 protein, but not mRNA, in Colo206f cells.

MAPPING

By FISH, Soejima et al. (1999) mapped the PDCD4 gene to chromosome
10q24.

606818	TITLE *606818 DIPEPTIDYL PEPTIDASE III; DPP3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DPP3 (EC 3.4.14.4) is one of the dipeptidyl aminopeptidases that remove
N-terminal dipeptides from physiologically active peptides such as
angiotensin (see 106150) or enkephalin (131330).

CLONING

Fukasawa et al. (1999) isolated a partial DPP3 cDNA clone from a
placenta cDNA library, using antibody to the purified protein as probe.
By mass spectrometry, Abramic et al. (2000) determined that the
molecular mass of full-length DPP3 is 82.5 kD; by SDS-PAGE, the apparent
molecular mass is 81.2 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

By mutation and enzyme analysis of the rat recombinant DPP3 protein,
Fukasawa et al. (1999) found that DPP3 shows zinc-dependent
metalloprotease activity and contains a conserved HELLGH motif with
similarity to the zincin HExxH consensus motif. Abramic et al. (2000)
noted that whereas the enzymes purified from rat and human erythrocytes
show the same molecular mass, pI, and enzyme substrates, they differ
significantly in their temperature stability, pH optima, kinetic
parameters, and sensitivity to divalent cations, sulfhydryl reagents,
and microbial protease inhibitors.

MAPPING

Fukasawa et al. (2000) mapped the DPP3 gene to chromosome 11q12-q13.1 by
FISH.

615416	TITLE *615416 BASIC HELIX-LOOP-HELIX FAMILY, MEMBER A9; BHLHA9
;;BASIC HELIX-LOOP-HELIX FACTOR, CLASS F, 42; BHLHF42
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins are transcription factors that
regulate embryonic development. They are characterized by a basic domain
that binds to E-box DNA and a helix-loop-helix domain that facilitates
interactions with other protein subunits. Class F bHLH transcription
factors, such as BHLHA9, have an additional COE (collier/OLF/EBF) domain
(see EBF1, 164343) that contributes to dimerization and DNA binding
(review by Jones, 2004).

CLONING

Klopocki et al. (2012) identified BHLHA9 as the only gene within an
11.8-kb minimal critical region on chromosome 17p for microduplications
in patients with split-hand/foot malformation with long bone deficiency
(SHFLD3; 612576). In situ hybridization of embryonic mouse and zebrafish
detected Bhlha9 expression limited to the distal limb bud mesenchyme
underlying the apical ectodermal ridge, a structure that functions with
the underlying progress zone in cell signaling required for
proliferation and limb growth.

GENE STRUCTURE

Klopocki et al. (2012) determined that the BHLHA9 gene contains a single
coding exon.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Klopocki et al. (2012) mapped the BHLHA9
gene to chromosome 17p13.3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using morpholinos directed against zebrafish Bhlha9, Klopocki et al.
(2012) found that knockdown of Bhlha9 resulted in massive truncation of
pectoral fins. Bhlha9 was not required for the initial induction of
pectoral fins.

;;CYCLIN-FOLD PROTEIN 1; CFP1;;
CYCLIN X; CCNX;;
CHROMOSOME 10 OPEN READING FRAME 9; C10ORF9
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cyclins, such as CCNY, control cell division cycles and regulate
cyclin-dependent kinases (e.g., CDC2; 116940) (Li et al., 2009).

CLONING

Using mass spectrometry to identify proteins upregulated in metastatic
versus nonmetastatic human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines,
followed by database analysis, Zhang et al. (2005) identified an isoform
of CCNY that they called CFP1 variant A. The deduced protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 36.9 kD.

By database analysis and PCR of a testis cDNA library, Li et al. (2009)
cloned CCNY, which they designated CCNX. The deduced 287-amino acid
protein has a central cyclin box and shares highest similarity with
cyclin B3 (CCNB3; 300456). RT-PCR detected highest expression in testis
and lower expression in all other tissues examined except brain and
kidney. Fluorescence-tagged CCNX was expressed predominantly in the
nucleus in a human nonsmall lung cancer cell line.

GENE STRUCTURE

Li et al. (2009) determined that the CCNY gene contains 12 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Deloukas et al. (2004) mapped the CCNY
gene to chromosome 10p11.2, where it lies between the CREM (123812) and
FZD8 (606146) genes.

GENE FUNCTION

Using the promoter regions of several cell cycle regulators and
transcription factors, Li et al. (2009) showed that CCNX specifically
activated transcription from the MYC (190080) promoter.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

For discussion of a possible association between variation in the CCNY
gene and inflammatory bowel disease, see IBD1 (266600).

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Bachman et al. (1997) cloned the human gene for the heart- and striated
muscle-specific isoform of cytochrome oxidase subunit 6a from a
chromosome 16-enriched genomic library. They reported that the gene
encodes a 97-amino acid polypeptide, including the 12-amino acid
presequence. The gene, symbolized COX6AH by them, is organized on 3
exons spanning approximately 1 kb of genomic DNA. Bachman et al. (1997)
identified several transcription factor binding sites in the promoter
region of the gene and noted that the 5-prime flanking regions of COX6AH
are highly conserved among human, bovine, and rodent.

MAPPING

Using a human/rodent mapping panel, Bachman et al. (1997) mapped the
human COX6AH gene to chromosome 16. The murine localization on distal
chromosome 7 between D7Mit8 and D7Mit13 predicted the location of the
human gene in the region 16p11-p12.
