600745	TITLE *600745 APOLIPOPROTEIN C-IV; APOC4
DESCRIPTION Allan et al. (1995) identified and characterized a previously unreported
human gene located within the previously known cluster of apolipoprotein
genes on chromosome 19: APOE (107741), APOC1 (107710), and APOC2
(608083). On the basis of its location and its properties, the new gene
was designated APOC4. Nucleotide sequence analysis of genomic DNA and
liver cDNA clones revealed a 3.3-kb gene consisting of 3 exons and 2
introns. Its 3-prime terminus lies 555 bp upstream of APOC2, giving the
2 genes the same transcriptional orientation. The promoter of the APOC4
gene lacks a typical TATA box, consistent with an apparent heterogeneity
in transcription start sites. RNase protection analysis indicated
relatively low apoC-IV mRNA levels in human liver, compared to apoC-II
mRNA levels. The predicted apoC-IV protein sequence, comprising 127
amino acid residues, contains a putative 25-residue signal peptide and 2
potential amphipathic alpha-helical domains. Amino acid sequence
comparisons indicated a limited homology between apoC-IV and either
apoC-I or apoC-II. Its hepatic expression and predicted protein
structure are characteristics of other genes in the chromosome 19
cluster and indicate that APOC4 is a member of the apolipoprotein gene
family.

606825	TITLE *606825 TENSIN 3; TNS3
;;TUMOR ENDOTHELIAL MARKER 6; TEM6
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE), St Croix et al. (2000)
identified partial cDNAs corresponding to several tumor endothelial
markers (TEMs) that displayed elevated expression during tumor
angiogenesis. Among the genes they identified was TEM6. Using database
searches and 5-prime RACE, Carson-Walter et al. (2001) derived sequences
covering the entire TEM6 coding region, which encodes a 261-amino acid
protein.

By searching databases for sequences similar to tensin-1 (TNS1; 600076),
Cui et al. (2004) identified a full-length tensin-3 cDNA. The deduced
1,445-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 155.3 kD.
Like other tensins, tensin-3 has an N-terminal actin-binding domain and
C-terminal SH2 and PTB domains. It also has several potential tyrosine
phosphorylation sites. Northern blot analysis detected high expression
of an 8-kb transcript in kidney and placenta, with weaker expression in
heart, skeletal muscle, spleen, liver, and lung. Western blot analysis
revealed a 180-kD tensin-3 protein in human endothelial and epithelial
cells and fibroblasts. Immunofluorescence analysis localized tensin-3 to
focal adhesions in human lung epithelial cells.

Using RT-PCR, Maeda et al. (2006) found that expression of tensin-3 was
high in thyroid, moderate in placenta, and low in other tissues
examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Cui et al. (2004) found that EGF (131530) induced tyrosine
phosphorylation of tensin-3 in human breast carcinoma cells in a time-
and dose-dependent manner. Tyrosine phosphorylation of tensin-3 required
activation of EGF receptor (EGFR; 131550) and SRC (190090) family kinase
activity. Tensin-3 formed a complex with focal adhesion kinase (FAK, or
PTK2; 600758) and p130Cas (BCAR1; 602941) in human breast carcinoma
cells. Addition of EGF to these cells induced dephosphorylation of FAK
and p130Cas, leading to dissociation of the tensin-3/FAK/p130Cas complex
and enhanced interaction between tensin-3 and EGFR. Cui et al. (2004)
proposed that tensin-3 functions as a platform for disassembly of
EGF-related signaling complexes at focal adhesions.

Katz et al. (2007) found that EGF downregulated expression of tensin-3
and concomitantly upregulated expression of CTEN (TNS4; 608385), a
tensin family member that lacks the actin-binding domain, in HeLa cells
and human breast carcinoma cells. Knockdown of CTEN or tensin-3 impaired
or enhanced mammary cell migration, respectively. Furthermore, CTEN
displaced tensin-3 from the cytoplasmic tail of integrin beta-1 (ITGB1;
135630), thereby inducing actin fiber disassembly. In invasive breast
cancer, CTEN expression correlated with high EGFR and HER2 (ERBB2;
164870) expression and with metastasis to lymph nodes. Moreover,
treatment of inflammatory breast cancer patients with an EGFR/HER2
inhibitor significantly downregulated CTEN expression. Katz et al.
(2007) concluded that a transcriptional tensin-3-CTEN switch may
contribute to metastasis of mammary cancer.

Using sequence-specific differential display, Maeda et al. (2006) found
that expression of tensin-3 was downregulated in thyroid tumors compared
with normal thyroid tissue.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the TEM6
gene to chromosome 7 (TMAP SHGC-15194).

612708	TITLE *612708 RANBP2-LIKE AND GRIP DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 5; RGPD5
;;RGP5;;
BS63
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using 5-prime RACE and nested PCR of testis total RNA, Cai et al. (2002)
cloned RGPD5, which they designated BS63. The deduced 1,765-amino acid
protein has structural characteristics of nucleoporins. Most of the
protein shares high homology with RANBP2 (601181), but it has a unique C
terminus. Cai et al. (2002) stated that Northern blot analysis detected
an 8.5-kb transcript in several human tissues and a 6-kb transcript in
testis only. Using immunoelectron microscopy of demembranated human
sperm, Cai et al. (2002) found that BS63 localized to the nuclear
membrane. In rat testis sections, Bs63 localized to nuclear pores in
spermatids.

By searching databases for intrachromosomal duplications of genes in
primates but not in other metazoans, Ciccarelli et al. (2005) identified
8 RGPD genes, including RGPD5, which they called RGP5. The RGPD genes
resulted from duplications of a region of human chromosome 2 containing
the RANBP2 and GCC2 (612711) genes. Like other RGPD proteins, the
deduced RGPD5 protein exceeds 1,700 amino acids. Most of the sequence is
homologous to regions of RANBP2, except for the C terminus, which
includes the GRIP domain from GCC2. Using primers that did not
differentiate between RGPD5 and RGPD6 (612709) for PCR analysis,
Ciccarelli et al. (2005) detected expression in testis and HeLa cell
cDNA libraries.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a mouse testis cDNA library, Cai et al.
(2002) found that human BS63 interacted with Ran (601179), transportin-1
(TNPO1; 602901), and Af10 (MLLT10; 602409), suggesting that BS63
functions in nuclear transport.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Ciccarelli et al. (2005) mapped the 8 RGPD
genes to chromosome 2p11.2-q13, and they named the genes according to
their physical order. RGPD5 is 1 of 6 RGPD genes on chromosome
2q12.3-q13.

EVOLUTION

See RGPD1 (612704) for information on the evolution of the RGPD genes.

614902	TITLE *614902 RHO GTPase-ACTIVATING PROTEIN 33; ARHGAP33
;;TC10/CDC42 GTPase-ACTIVATING PROTEIN; TCGAP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chiang et al. (2003) cloned mouse Arhgap33, which they called Tcgap. The
deduced 1,305-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 140
kD. Tcgap has an N-terminal phox (see 608512) homology (PX) domain,
followed by an SRC (190090) homology-3 (SH3) domain, a RHO (see 165390)
GTPase-activating protein (GAP) domain, and a proline- and serine-rich
C-terminal domain that includes 22 PxxP motifs. Tcgap also has 5 PEST
sequences, which are typically found in proteins with short half-lives.
Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses revealed high Tcgap expression in
mouse brain and testis, with lower expression in white adipose tissue
and muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Chiang et al. (2003) found that the isolated GAP domain of mouse Tcgap
stimulated the intrinsic GTPase activities of Cdc42 (116952) and Rac1
(602048) in vitro. However, full-length Tcgap did not function as a GAP
following expression in cultured cells. Mutation analysis, in vitro
analysis, and transfection studies revealed that full-length Tcgap and
the isolated Tcgap domains interacted with many partners: the PX domain
interacted with phosphoinositides, predominantly phosphatidylinositol
(4,5)bisphosphate; the GAP domain interacted with the small GTPases
Cdc42 and Tc10-beta (RHOJ; 607653); and the C-terminal proline-rich
domain interacted with the SH3 domain of the insulin-responsive protein
CrkII (CRK; 164762). Insulin treatment of mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes
resulted in Tcgap translocation to the plasma membrane via a Cap
(605264)/Cbl (165360) and CrkII pathway. Tcgap negatively regulated
insulin signaling and blocked insulin-dependent Glut4 (SLC2A4; 138190)
translocation to the plasma membrane and 2-deoxyglucose uptake.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the ARHGAP33 gene to chromosome 19q13.12 based on an
alignment of the ARHGAP33 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AY044864) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

610216	TITLE *610216 ANOCTAMIN 8; ANO8
;;TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN 16H; TMEM16H;;
KIAA1623
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned TMEM16H, which they designated
KIAA1623. RT-PCR ELISA detected expression in all adult tissues and all
specific brain regions examined, with highest expression in the
cerebellum and substantia nigra.

By searching databases for sequences similar to TMEM16E (608662), Katoh
and Katoh (2005) identified the TMEM16H gene. The deduced full-length
protein contains 1,232 amino acids. They identified a splice variant
that contains an 823-bp insertion corresponding to a retained intron 17
and that results in a C-terminally truncated protein of 1,114 amino
acids due to an in-frame stop codon in intron 17. Both full-length
TMEM16H and its splice variant contain the 8 transmembrane domains and N
and C termini facing the cytoplasm that are characteristic of all TMEM16
family members (see TMEM16A, 610108). By in silico analysis of EST
sequences, Katoh and Katoh (2005) detected TMEM16H expression in
embryonic stem cells, fetal brain, and neural tissues.

GENE STRUCTURE

Katoh and Katoh (2005) determined that the TMEM16H gene has 18 exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the TMEM16H
gene to chromosome 19. By sequence analysis, Katoh and Katoh (2005)
mapped the TMEM16H gene to chromosome 19p13.11.

605358	TITLE *605358 GENERAL TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR IIA, 1-LIKE; GTF2A1L
;;TFIIA-ALPHA/BETA-LIKE FACTOR; ALF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Synthesis of eukaryotic mRNA requires the assembly of RNA polymerase II
and various general transcription factors, such as the TFIIA subunits
alpha/beta (GTF2A1; 600520) and gamma (GTF2A2; 600519), which interact
with the TATA-binding protein (TBP; 600075) and a separate 4-helix
bundle positioned just upstream of the TBP-TATA complex. ALF is a germ
cell-specific transcription factor with a domain structure similar to
GTF2A1 (Upadhyaya et al., 1999).

CLONING

By searching databases for genes similar to GTF2A1, followed by 5-prime
RACE of a testis cDNA library, Upadhyaya et al. (1999) cloned ALF. The
478-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 53 kD. In
comparison with the organization of GTF2A1, ALF has conserved regions I
and IV and acidic region III, but it has a distinct region II. Northern
and dot blot analyses showed strong testis-restricted expression of a
1.8-kb ALF transcript, which differed from the widespread expression of
GTF2A1 and GTF2A2. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed a 69-kD ALF protein.
Upadhyaya et al. (1999) suggested that the difference between the
calculated and observed molecular masses may be due to the effect of
charged region III.

Han et al. (2001) cloned mouse Alf. The mouse protein shares highest
similarity with human ALF in regions I and IV. Northern blot analysis of
mouse and rat tissues detected expression only in testis. Expression was
first detected in mouse testis at postnatal day 14. Sedimentation
analysis and in situ hybridization showed that Alf was expressed in
pachytene spermatocytes and haploid spermatids.

In the process of cloning ALF, Upadhyaya et al. (1999) also cloned a
longer transcript, SALF, containing most of the ALF sequence at its
3-prime end. Han et al. (2001) determined that SALF is a chimeric
transcript that contains exons 1 through 3 of STON1 (605357) spliced to
exons 2 through 9 of ALF. See 605357 for further information on SALF.

GENE FUNCTION

Using gel shift analysis, Upadhyaya et al. (1999) demonstrated that,
like GTF2A1, ALF, in conjunction with GTF2A2 and TBP, bound DNA.
Functional analysis showed that ALF, together with GTF2A2, allowed mRNA
transcription.

Upadhyaya et al. (2002) found that mammalian ALF was able to stabilize
the binding of TBP to DNA, but it could not stabilize several TBP
mutants. Phosphorylation of ALF with casein kinase II (see CSNK2A1;
115440) resulted in partial restoration of complex formation using
mutant TBPs. Studies of ALF-TBP complexes formed on the adenovirus major
late promoter revealed protection of the TATA box and upstream sequences
from -38 to -20 on the top strand and -40 to -22 on the bottom strand.
The presence of ALF or TFIIA did not significantly alter the ability of
TBP to bind TATA elements from several testis specific genes. Analysis
of the distinct, nonhomologous internal regions II of ALF and GTF2A1
using circular dichroism spectroscopy suggested that these domains are
unordered. Upadhyaya et al. (2002) concluded that the role of ALF in the
assembly and stabilization of initiation complexes in germ cells is
likely to be similar or identical to the role of TFIIA in somatic cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Han et al. (2001) determined that the ALF gene contains 9 exons.

MAPPING

By PCR of a panel of human-rodent chromosomal hybrids and genomic
sequence analysis, Han et al. (2001) mapped the GTF2A1L gene to
chromosome 2p.

612945	TITLE *612945 RAS-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN RAB4B; RAB4B
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

RAB proteins, such as RAB4B, are members of the RAS superfamily of small
GTPases that are involved in vesicular trafficking (He et al., 2002).

CLONING

By searching databases for RAS family members, followed by PCR, He et
al. (2002) cloned RAB4B. The deduced 212-amino acid RAB4B protein
contains 4 highly conserved GTPase motifs and a C-terminal
geranylgeranylation motif. Northern blot analysis detected a major
transcript of about 1.2 kb that showed highest expressed in ovary,
followed by thymus and prostate. Lower expression was detected in
spleen, testis, small intestine, colon, peripheral blood, lung,
pancreas, heart, and kidney. Little to no expression was detected in
brain, placenta, liver, and skeletal muscle.

GENE STRUCTURE

He et al. (2002) determined that the RAB4B gene contains 8 exons and
spans over 20 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, He et al. (2002) mapped the RAB4B gene to
chromosome 19q13.2-q13.3.

Barbosa et al. (1995) mapped the mouse Rab4b gene to proximal chromosome

606888	TITLE *606888 CHOLINERGIC RECEPTOR, NEURONAL NICOTINIC, ALPHA POLYPEPTIDE 6; CHRNA6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CHRNA6 is 1 of several subunits that can be incorporated into 5-subunit
nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), which function as
ligand-gated ion channels involved in fast synaptic transmission
(Ebihara et al., 2002). In rodents, receptors containing Chrna6 are
selectively expressed in dopamine (DA) neuron cell bodies and
presynaptic terminals (Drenan et al., 2008).

CLONING

Elliott et al. (1996) cloned CHRNA6 from a substantia nigra cDNA library
screened with the rat Chrna6 cDNA as probe. The deduced 464-amino acid
protein has a calculated molecular mass of 53.7 kD and contains a signal
peptide, 2 N-glycosylation sites, and 4 transmembrane regions. The human
and rat proteins share 87% sequence identity.

By in situ hybridization of rat brain, Le Novere et al. (1996) found
that alpha-6 was expressed predominantly in dopaminergic cell groups of
the mesencephalon and noradrenergic cells of the locus ceruleus. It was
not expressed in the telencephalon.

By in situ hybridization of mouse brain, Champtiaux et al. (2002) showed
that alpha-6 mRNA was expressed in retinal ganglion cells, locus
ceruleus, substantia nigra, and neurons of the ventral tegmental area.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoprecipitation analysis of mouse striatal extracts, Champtiaux
et al. (2003) identified 3 main types of heteromeric nAChRs: alpha-4
(CHRNA4; 118504)/beta-2 (CHRNB2; 118507), alpha-6/beta-2, and
alpha-4/alpha-6/beta-2. Alpha-6/beta-2 nAChRs were mainly located on DA
nerve terminals and were the direct target of alpha-conotoxin MII
inhibition. A combination of alpha-6/beta-2 and alpha-4/beta-2 nAChRs
mediated endogenous cholinergic modulation of DA release induced by
systemic nicotine administration at nerve terminals. Alpha-4/beta-2
nAChRs appeared to represent the majority of nAChRs on DA neuron soma
and contributed to nicotine reinforcement.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ebihara et al. (2002) determined that the CHRNA6 gene spans 16 kb and
contains 6 exons, all which are coding. The upstream regulatory region
has no TATA box or GC-rich sequences, but it has a number of putative
transcription factor-binding sites and 2 tandem Alu elements that
functioned as repressors in reporter gene assays. CHRNA6 has at least 4
transcription start sites.

MAPPING

Using FISH, Ebihara et al. (2002) mapped the CHRNA6 gene to chromosome
8p11.22-p11.21.

ANIMAL MODEL

Champtiaux et al. (2002) found that alpha-6 -/- mice were viable and
appeared normal. Home cage behavior of alpha-6 -/- mice appeared normal,
as was spontaneous locomotor activity in an open-field test. Histologic
examination revealed normal cell layering in the retina and normal
retinal ganglion cell projections. Cell number and morphology at the
striatum and mesencephalic level were also normal, with normal labeling
of DA neurons. However, ligand-binding experiments revealed reduced
binding of nicotinic ligands in alpha-6 -/- brains compared with
wildtype.

Drenan et al. (2008) created 2 transgenic mouse lines that expressed
both wildtype alpha-6 and alpha-6 with an activating mutation in DA
neurons. Transgenic mice were hypersensitive to nicotine, displayed
locomotor hyperactivity in their home cage, and failed to habituate to a
novel environment. Stimulation with nicotine exaggerated the phenotype
in a dose-dependent manner. DA neurons of transgenic mice showed
augmented nicotine-stimulated DA release from presynaptic terminals and
elevated nicotinic currents.

300353	TITLE *300353 V-SET AND IMMUNOGLOBULIN DOMAINS-CONTAINING PROTEIN 4; VSIG4
;;IMMUNOGLOBULIN SUPERFAMILY PROTEIN Z39IG; Z39IG;;
COMPLEMENT RECEPTOR OF THE IMMUNOGLOBULIN SUPERFAMILY; CRIG
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The region around the centromere of the X chromosome is a hotspot for
genes involved in mental retardation. By probing a fetal brain cDNA
library with a PCR product derived from an EST mapping to the centromere
area of the X chromosome, followed by subcloning and primer walking,
Langnaese et al. (2000) isolated a cDNA encoding Z39IG. The deduced
399-amino acid transmembrane protein contains a signal peptide, a V-type
Ig-like domain, a C2-type Ig-like domain, several potential
O-glycosylation sites, and an intracellular domain with 2 potential
phosphorylation sites. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a
1.9-kb transcript in adult lung but not in other tissues tested. PCR
analysis of cDNA libraries, however, detected ubiquitous expression of
Z39IG in fetal and adult tissues, although the levels were relatively
low in adult brain and skeletal muscle. Langnaese et al. (2000)
concluded that Z39IG is most likely involved in general fetal
development and pulmonary function and not mental retardation.

Helmy et al. (2006) cloned 2 splice variants of VSIG4, which they called
CRIG, from a human fetal cDNA library. The longer form is identical to
Z39Ig (Langnaese et al., 2000) and encodes a protein with both V- and
C2-type Ig domains, whereas the short form encodes a protein with a
single V-type Ig domain. Only the short form is present in mouse. The
cytoplasmic domain of CRIG contains 2 consensus AP2 (see 601024)
internalization motifs. Northern blot analysis detected a major 1.7-kb
transcript and a minor 1.4-kb transcript. Highest expression was in
placenta, lung, adrenal gland, heart, and liver, with lower levels in
all other tissues examined. Flow cytometry showed that CRIG was
expressed in macrophages, but not monocytes. Western blot analysis
revealed 50- and 45-kD CRIG proteins on monocyte-derived macrophages.
Immunohistochemistry showed that CRIG was highly expressed on liver
Kupffer cells and on subsets of macrophages in various tissues,
including heart, adrenal gland, and lung.

GENE FUNCTION

Helmy et al. (2006) found that both soluble and cell surface-expressed
CRIG bound complement fragments C3b (120700) and iC3b.
Immunofluorescence microscopy of human monocyte-derived macrophages
showed that CRIG was actively recruited from recycling endosomes to
sites of C3b-coated particle ingestion and participated in the initial
stages of phagosome formation. CRIG then recycled from the phagosome
prior to phagosome-lysosome fusion to return to the endosomal
compartment, thus avoiding degradation.

Vogt et al. (2006) found that VSIG4 inhibited proliferation of mouse and
human T cells and production of IL2 (147680) in vitro. Administration of
VSIG4 to mice reduced induction of T-cell responses and production of
Th-dependent IgG. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that VSIG4
expression was restricted to resting tissue macrophages and was absent
upon activation with lipopolysaccharide and in autoimmune inflammatory
foci. The results suggested that VSIG4 may be an inhibitory ligand that
maintains T-cell unresponsiveness in healthy tissues.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Wiesmann et al. (2006) presented the crystal structure of C3b (see C3,
120700) in complex with CRIG and, using CRIG mutants, provided evidence
that CRIG acts as an inhibitor of the alternative pathway of complement.
The structure showed that activation of C3 induces major structural
rearrangements, including a dramatic movement (greater than 80
angstroms) of the thioester bond-containing domain through which C3b
attaches to pathogen surfaces. Wiesmann et al. (2006) showed that CRIG
is not only a phagocytic receptor, but also a potent inhibitor of the
alternative pathway convertases. Wiesmann et al. (2006) concluded that
the structure provides insights into the complex macromolecular
structural rearrangements that occur during complement activation and
inhibition.

GENE STRUCTURE

Langnaese et al. (2000) determined that the Z39IG gene spans 18.3 kb and
contains 8 exons.

MAPPING

Langnaese et al. (2000) stated that an EST corresponding to the Z39IG
gene maps to Xq12.

ANIMAL MODEL

Helmy et al. (2006) generated Crig -/- mice, which were born at expected
mendelian ratios and exhibited no gross phenotypic or histopathologic
abnormalities. They found that expression of Crig on liver Kupffer cells
was required for efficient binding and phagocytosis of complement
C3-opsonized particles. Crig -/- Kupffer cells were unable to
efficiently clear C3-opsonized pathogens in circulation, resulting in
increased infection and mortality. Helmy et al. (2006) concluded that
CRIG represents a dominant component of the phagocytic system
responsible for rapid clearance of C3-opsonized particles from
circulation.

608928	TITLE *608928 ELASTIN MICROFIBRIL INTERFACER 2; EMILIN2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using the C1q (see 120550)-like domain of EMILIN1 (130660) as bait in a
yeast 2-hybrid screen of a kidney cDNA library, followed by screening an
aorta cDNA library, Doliana et al. (2001) cloned EMILIN2. The deduced
1,053-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal signal peptide with a
consensus signal cleavage site, followed by an emilin (EMI) domain,
several coiled-coil domains, a proline-rich region, a collagen-like
coiled-coil alpha-helical region, and a C-terminal C1q domain. The
mature 1,023-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 112
kD. EMILIN2 also has 8 potential N-glycosylation sites and 20 cysteines,
a number of which are clustered as doublets that may form intramolecular
disulfide bonds. RNA dot blot analysis detected high EMILIN1 expression
in fetal heart and adult lung. Intermediate expression was detected in
peripheral leukocytes, placenta, and spinal cord, and low expression was
detected in fetal brain, spleen, thymus, and lung, and in adult heart,
aorta, testis, bone marrow, small intestine, thymus, lymph node, and
appendix. No expression was detected in other tissues tested. Confocal
microscopy of a leiomyosarcoma cell line detected extracellular EMILIN2
staining in a meshwork pattern. EMILIN2 partially colocalized with
EMILIN1.

By in situ hybridization of day-9.5 mouse embryos, Leimeister et al.
(2002) found strong expression of Emilin2 in the neural fold, limb buds,
and heart. At later developmental stages, it was expressed in
interstitial cells throughout the embryo and in the trabecular layer of
embryonic heart.

GENE STRUCTURE

Doliana et al. (2001) determined that the EMILIN2 gene contains 8 exons
and spans about 40 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Doliana et al. (2001) mapped the EMILIN2
gene to chromosome 18p11.3. Leimeister et al. (2002) stated that the
EMILIN2 gene maps to chromosome 18p11.32.

603616	TITLE *603616 RAB GTPase-BINDING EFFECTOR PROTEIN 1; RABEP1
;;RABAPTIN 5; RABPT5
RABEP1/PDGFRB FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The small GTPase RAB5 (179512) is a rate-limiting component in membrane
docking or fusion in the early endocytic pathway. The GTP-bound form of
RAB5 is the active conformation. Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen, Stenmark
et al. (1995) identified HeLa cell cDNAs encoding a protein that
interacted with the GTP-bound form of RAB5. The predicted 862-amino acid
protein was designated rabaptin-5, a name combining the Greek word
'apto,' meaning 'touch', with RAB5. Both the N- and C-terminal regions
of rabaptin-5 are predicted to be mainly alpha-helical and contain
heptad repeats characteristic of coiled-coil domains. Western blot
analysis of mammalian cell extracts indicated that the 115-kD protein is
ubiquitously expressed and is present in a major cytosolic and minor
endosome-bound pool.

GENE FUNCTION

Stenmark et al. (1995) demonstrated that rabaptin-5 binds directly to
RAB5 and preferentially to its GTP-bound form. RAB5 recruits rabaptin-5
to early endosomes in a GTP-dependent manner. Overexpression of
rabaptin-5 leads to morphologic alterations of the early endosome
compartment similar to those induced by overexpression of RAB5. The
authors concluded that rabaptin-5 is an effector of RAB5 that transmits
the signal of the active GTP-bound RAB5 conformation to the membrane
docking and/or fusion apparatus. They proposed a model in which RAB5-GDP
is converted by a membrane-bound GDP/GTP exchange factor into the active
GTP-bound conformation. Once activated, GTP-bound RAB5 then recruits
rabaptin-5 from the cytosol, thereby positioning rabaptin-5 to exert its
function in membrane docking or fusion.

Xiao et al. (1997) reported that tuberin (191092) exhibits substantial
GTPase-activating protein activity towards RAB5, and that rabaptin-5
mediates the tuberin association with RAB5.

Using immunodepletion experiments, Horiuchi et al. (1997) found that the
RABGEF1 (609700)-RABPT5 complex was essential for both homotypic and
heterotypic endosome fusions. Both RABGEF1 and RABPT5 bound RAB5
preferentially in the presence of GTP rather than GDP. RABGEF1 displayed
specific GDP/GTP exchange activity on RAB5 upon delivery of RAB5 to the
membrane.

Mattera et al. (2003) found that the GGAs (e.g., GGA1; 606004), a family
of ARF (see 103180)-dependent clathrin adaptors involved in selection of
trans-Golgi network cargo, interacted with the RABGEF1-RABPT5 complex in
vitro and in vivo.

Omori et al. (2008) identified elipsa, the zebrafish ortholog of
TRAF3IP1 (607380), as a component of intraflagellar transport particles,
which are involved in the formation and function of cilia. Elipsa
interacted with rabaptin-5, which in turn interacted with Rab8 (RAB8A;
165040), a small GTPase localized to cilia. Omori et al. (2008)
concluded that elipsa, rabaptin-5, and Rab8 provide a bridge between the
intraflagellar transport particle and protein complexes that assemble at
the ciliary membrane.

Endocytosis plays a major role in the deactivation of receptors
localized to the plasma membrane. Wang et al. (2009) found that hypoxia,
via the VHL (608537)-HIF2A (EPAS1; 603349) signaling pathway,
downregulated rabaptin-5 expression, leading to decelerated endocytosis
and prolonged activation of ligand-bound EGFR (131550). Primary kidney
and breast tumors with strong hypoxic signatures showed significantly
lower expression of rabaptin-5 RNA and protein. Wang et al. (2009)
identified a conserved hypoxia-responsive element (HRE) in the
rabaptin-5 promoter that bound in vitro-translated HIF1A (603348) and
HIF2A, leading to displacement of RNA polymerase II and attenuating
rabaptin-5 transcription.

MAPPING

The RABEP1 gene maps to chromosome 17p13 (Magnusson et al., 2001).

CYTOGENETICS

In a patient with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML; see 607785) and
an acquired t(5;17)(q33;p13), Magnusson et al. (2001) demonstrated
rabaptin-5 as a novel partner fused in-frame to the 5-prime portion of
the PDGFBR gene (173410). The fusion protein included more than 85% of
the native rabaptin-5 fused to the transmembrane and intracellular
tyrosine kinase domains of PDGFRB. Rabaptin-5 is an essential and
rate-limiting component of early endosomal fusion. The RABEP1/PDGFRB
fusion protein links 2 important pathways of growth regulation.

609701	TITLE *609701 N-ACETYLGLUCOSAMINIDASE, ALPHA-; NAGLU
;;N-ACETYL-ALPHA-D-GLUCOSAMINIDASE;;
N-ACETYL-ALPHA-GLUCOSAMINIDASE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Zhao et al. (1995) and Zhao et al. (1996) cloned a cDNA corresponding to
alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase, which they symbolized NAGLU. The deduced
743-amino acid protein has a 20- to 23-residue leader sequence,
consistent with a signal peptide, and 6 potential N-glycosylation sites.
The mature protein contains 720 amino acids and has a molecular mass of
approximately 80 kD.

Weber et al. (1996) reported the cloning of the NAGLU gene by enzyme
protein purification, amino acid sequence determination, and database
searches. A TFASTA search aligned the amino acid sequence to sequence in
the 5-prime flanking region of the 17-beta-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase-1 gene (HSD17B1; 109684), and this sequence was used to
screen cDNA libraries. Northern blot analysis showed a single 2.7-kb
mRNA transcript with high expression levels in liver, ovary, and
peripheral blood leukocytes and measurable amounts of transcript in
other tissues. The full-length cDNA sequence was cloned into an
expression vector, and cultured CHO cells transfected with this vector
showed a 17-fold increase in enzyme expression.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhao et al. (1996) determined that the NAGLU gene contains 6 exons and
spans 8.3 kb.

MAPPING

Zhao et al. (1996) mapped the NAGLU gene to chromosome 17q21. The
3-prime end of NAGLU resides in the upstream flanking region of the
HSD17B1 gene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Vance et al. (1980) demonstrated variable alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase
activity levels among different groups of normal control populations,
indicating polymorphisms within the gene that encodes the enzyme.
Pericak-Vance et al. (1985) confirmed the polymorphisms reported by
Vance et al. (1980) in studies of a large black kindred. They pointed
out that alleles for high and low NAG enzyme activity might confuse the
identification of heterozygotes. The mean values for NAG activity of the
3 genotypes varied in black and in white groups. Thermal stability data
were cited that suggested that structurally distinct allelic forms of
the enzyme may be segregating in the 2 racial groups.

Using SSCP analysis of PCR-amplified segments of genomic DNA from
patients with Sanfilippo syndrome B, also known as mucopolysaccharidosis
(MPS) IIIB (252920), Zhao et al. (1996) identified several recessive
mutations in the NAGLU gene (see, e.g., 609701.0001-609701.0005). All
missense mutations occurred at CpG sites, known to be mutagenic
hotspots.

Zhao et al. (1998) stated that 36% of all known point mutations in the
NAGLU gene causing MPS IIIB (8 of 22 alleles) involve arginine-674 (see,
e.g., 609701.0001), a codon having a CpG dinucleotide in the critical
initial position.

In 9 fibroblast cell lines of Sanfilippo syndrome B patients,
Schmidtchen et al. (1998) identified 10 additional mutations in the
NAGLU gene. Functional expression studies showed that the mutant enzymes
had no residual activity. Nine of the 10 amino acid substitutions that
had been identified to that time clustered near the amino or the carboxy
end of the enzyme, suggesting a role for these regions in the transport
or function of the protein.

Beesley et al. (1998) identified 12 novel mutations in the NAGLU gene in
14 patients with MPS IIIB. Bunge et al. (1999) identified 21 mutations,
including 18 novel mutations, in the NAGLU gene in 22 patients with MPS
IIIB. The mutation spectrum consisted of 2 small insertions, 2 small
deletions, 3 nonsense mutations, and 14 different missense mutations, 1
of which affected the initiation codon.

In a study of 40 patients with Sanfilippo syndrome B, most of them of
Australasian and Dutch origin, Weber et al. (1999) identified 31
mutations, 25 of them novel, and 2 polymorphisms in the NAGLU gene. The
observed allelic heterogeneity reflected the wide spectrum of clinical
phenotypes reported for these patients. Most of the changes were
missense mutations; 4 nonsense and 9 frameshift mutations caused by
insertions or deletions were also identified. Only 5 mutations were
found in more than 1 patient. R643C (609701.0006) and R297X
(609701.0003) each accounted for approximately 20% of MPS IIIB alleles
in the Dutch patient group, while R297X, P521L (609701.0007), R565W
(609701.0008), and R626X (609701.0002) each had a frequency of about 6%
in Australasian patients. R643C seemed to be a Dutch MPS IIIB allele and
clearly conferred an attenuated phenotype. One region of the gene showed
a higher concentration of mutations, probably reflecting the instability
of this area which contains a direct repeat. Several arginine residues
seemed to be hotspots for mutations, being affected by 2 or 3 individual
basepair exchanges (see 609701.0004 and 609701.0006).

In a mutation screen of 20 patients with Sanfilippo syndrome B,
Tessitore et al. (2000) identified 28 mutations, 14 of which were novel,
in the NAGLU gene. Of these mutations, 4 were found in homozygosity and
only 1 was seen in 2 different patients, showing the remarkable
molecular heterogeneity of the disorder.

Yogalingam and Hopwood (2001) reported that 86 new mutations had been
identified in the NAGLU gene in MPS IIIB patients: 58 missense/nonsense
mutations, 27 insertion/deletions, and 1 splice site mutation. All
mutations were associated with severe clinical phenotypes.

Tanaka et al. (2002) performed molecular analysis of the NAGLU gene in 7
Japanese patients with Sanfilippo syndrome type B from 6 unrelated
families; 6 disease-causing mutations were found, of which 2 were novel.
Two families were from Okinawa, where more patients with Sanfilippo
syndrome were found than in other areas in Japan. Two sibs, who were
compound heterozygous for F314L (609701.0011) and R565P (609701.0009),
showed an attenuated form. Two patients with a severe phenotype with
rapid progression were homozygous for R482W (609701.0012) and R565P,
respectively. Tanaka et al. (2002) suggested that the R565P mutation is
common in Okinawa. Chinen et al. (2005) identified the homozygous R565P
mutation in 5 unrelated Japanese patients from Okinawa, suggesting a
founder effect.

Najmabadi et al. (2011) performed homozygosity mapping followed by exon
enrichment and next-generation sequencing in 136 consanguineous families
(over 90% Iranian and less than 10% Turkish or Arabic) segregating
syndromic or nonsyndromic forms of autosomal recessive intellectual
disability. They identified a family (8600486) in which 3 of 4 children,
born to parents related as first cousins once removed, had MPS IIIB
(severe intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and coarse
facial features) and a homozygous missense mutation in the NAGLU gene
(609701.0014).

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

In the study of Weber et al. (1999), all mutations resulting in
premature termination either by a nonsense mutation or frameshift
insertions and deletions led to the severe phenotype. Similarly,
deletions masking the normal stop codon and presumably elongating the
gene product conferred a severe phenotype when in combination with
R297X. Missense mutations V334F and P521L also caused the severe
phenotype when present on both alleles in individual patients. Most of
the Dutch patients showed clinical symptoms consistent with the
attenuated form of the disease. Two patients were diagnosed at the age
of 63 and 47 years, respectively. Two of the attenuated cases, who were
apparently not related, were found to be homozygous for R643C, an allele
that was also identified in an attenuated patient with an unknown second
allele. Two patients with R297X in combination with an unknown genotype
(compound heterozygotes) had the severe and attenuated phenotype,
respectively, implying that the unknown alleles modified the severity of
the clinical phenotype.

ANIMAL MODEL

Li et al. (1999) found that Naglu-deficient mice were healthy and
fertile while young and could survive for 8 to 12 months. They were
totally deficient in alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase and had massive
accumulation of heparan sulfate in liver and kidney, as well as
secondary changes in activity of several other lysosomal enzymes in
liver and brain and elevation of gangliosides GM2 and GM3 in brain.
Vacuolation was seen in many cells, including macrophages, epithelial
cells, and neurons, and became more prominent with age. Although most
vacuoles contained finely granular material characteristic of
glycosaminoglycan accumulation, large pleiomorphic inclusions were seen
in some neurons and pericytes in the brain. Abnormal hypoactive behavior
was manifested by 4.5-month-old Naglu -/- mice in an open field test;
the hyperactivity that is characteristic of affected children was not
observed even in younger mice. In a pavlovian fear conditioning test,
the 4.5-month-old mutant mice showed normal response to context,
indicating intact hippocampal-dependent learning, but reduced response
to a conditioning tone, perhaps attributable to hearing impairment. The
phenotype of the deficient mice was considered sufficiently similar to
that of patients with Sanfilippo syndrome B to make these mice a good
model for study of pathophysiology and for development of therapy.

In mouse models, Ohmi et al. (2003) investigated the implications of
microglial involvement for the pathogenesis as well as the potential
treatment of MPS I (see 607014) and MPS IIIB. Their investigation showed
an inflammatory component of brain disease in both disorders, as is
known for many neurodegenerative disorders.

Ryazantsev et al. (2007) performed a detailed study of the brain
pathology in mice deficient for the Naglu gene developed by Li et al.
(1999). In contrast to somatic cells, which accumulate primarily heparan
sulfate, neurons accumulate a number of apparently unrelated
metabolites, including subunit c of mitochondrial ATPase synthase
(SCMAS). SCMAS accumulated from 1 month of age, primarily in the medial
entorhinal cortex and layer V of the somatosensory cortex. Its
accumulation was not due to the absence of specific proteases. Light
microscopy of brain sections of 6-month-old mice showed SCMAS to
accumulate in the same organelles as Lamp1 (153330) and Lamp2 (309060).
Cryoimmunoelectron microscopy showed SCMAS to be present in
Lamp-positive vesicles bounded by a single membrane (lysosomes), in
fingerprint-like layered arrays. GM3 ganglioside was also seen in
lysosomes of microglia, suggesting phagocytosis of neuronal membranes.
Samples used for cryoelectron microscopy and further processed by
standard electron microscopy procedures showed the disappearance of the
SCMAS fingerprint arrays and appearance in the same location of 'zebra
bodies,' well known but little understood inclusions in the brain of
patients with mucopolysaccharidosis.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE IIIB
NAGLU, ARG674HIS

In 2 Arab patients with Sanfilippo B syndrome, or mucopolysaccharidosis
type IIIB (252920), Zhao et al. (1996) identified a homozygous 2021G-A
transition in the NAGLU gene, resulting in an arg674-to-his (R674H)
substitution.

.0002
MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE IIIB
NAGLU, ARG626TER

In a cell line (GM156) from a patient with Sanfilippo syndrome B
(252920) from the Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository, Zhao et al.
(1996) identified a homozygous 1876C-T transition in the NAGLU gene,
resulting in an arg626-to-ter (R626X) substitution.

.0003
MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE IIIB
NAGLU, ARG297TER

In a cell line (GM156) from a patient with Sanfilippo syndrome B
(252920) from the Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository, Zhao et al.
(1996) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the NAGLU
gene: an 889C-T transition, resulting in an arg297-to-ter (R297X)
substitution, and a G-to-A transition, resulting in an arg643-to-his
(R643H; 609701.0004) substitution.

Weber et al. (1999) found that the R297X mutation was the most common
mutation in a cohort of Dutch and Australasian MPS IIIB patients,
occurring at a frequency of 12.5%. Yogalingam et al. (2000) found that
this mutation was associated with very low levels of NAGLU activity and
12-fold elevations of 35-S-labeled GAG storage when compared with normal
fibroblasts.

.0004
MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE IIIB
NAGLU, ARG643HIS

See 609701.0003 and Zhao et al. (1996).

Weber et al. (1999) reported that an R643C mutation (609701.0006)
accounted for approximately 20% of MPS IIIB (252920) alleles in a Dutch
patient group, suggesting that this arginine residue is a hotspot for
mutations.

.0005
MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE IIIB
NAGLU, 10-BP DEL, NT503

In cell line from a patient with Sanfilippo syndrome B (252920), Zhao et
al. (1996) found homozygosity for a 10-bp deletion in the NAGLU gene
beginning at nucleotide 503; the deletion resulted in a frameshift and
predicted termination 14 codons later. The deletion occurs at a direct
repeat of a tetranucleotide, GGAG, and may be the result of slipped
mispairing during DNA replication.

.0006
MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE IIIB
NAGLU, ARG643CYS

Weber et al. (1999) reported that an arg643-to-cys (R643C) missense
mutation in the NAGLU gene accounted for approximately 20% of MPS IIIB
(252920) alleles in a Dutch patient group. Arginine-643 appears to be a
hotspot for mutations; see R643H 609701.0004.

.0007
MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE IIIB
NAGLU, PRO521LEU

Weber et al. (1999) found that a pro521-to-leu (P521L) missense mutation
in the NAGLU gene accounted for approximately 6% of mutations in
Australasian patients with Sanfilippo syndrome B (252920).

.0008
MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE IIIB
NAGLU, ARG565TRP

Weber et al. (1999) found that an arg565-to-trp (R565W) missense
mutation accounted for approximately 6% of the mutant alleles in
Australasian patients with Sanfilippo syndrome B (252920).

.0009
MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE IIIB
NAGLU, ARG565PRO

Weber et al. (1999) observed an arg565-to-pro (R565P) mutation of the
NAGLU gene in compound heterozygous state in a patient with Sanfilippo
syndrome B (252920). The arginine-565 residue appears to be a hotspot
for mutations; see 609701.0008.

Tanaka et al. (2002) identified the R565P mutation in homozygous state
in a patient with a severe form of Sanfilippo syndrome B. Tanaka et al.
(2002) suggested that the R565P mutation may be common in Okinawa.
Chinen et al. (2005) identified the homozygous R565P mutation in 5
unrelated Japanese patients with Sanfilippo syndrome B, suggesting a
founder effect. One of 200 control individuals was heterozygous for the
mutation. The R565P substitution results from an 8839G-C transversion in
exon 6 of the NAGLU gene.

.0010
MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE IIIB
NAGLU, PHE48LEU

Yogalingam et al. (2000) reported a patient with an attenuated form of
Sanfilippo syndrome B (252920) who was a compound heterozygote for 2
mutations in the NAGLU gene: an R297X substitution (609701.0003) and a
phe48-to-leu (F48L) substitution. The F48L mutation was associated with
a partially degraded polypeptide in a 16-hour chase experiment,
suggesting that this missense mutation affects the processing and
stability of NAGLU. It was associated with significant residual NAGLU
activity sufficient to metabolize 34% of intracellular 35-S-labeled GAG
storage, suggesting that some F48L-NAGLU was being correctly sorted to
the lysosomal compartment. Yogalingam et al. (2000) suggested that the
residual NAGLU activity could explain the attenuated phenotype in their
patient.

.0011
MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE IIIB
NAGLU, PHE314LEU

In 2 sibs with an attenuated form of Sanfilippo syndrome B (252920),
Tanaka et al. (2002) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations
in the NAGLU gene: a phe314-to-leu (F314L) substitution and an R565P
(609701.0009) substitution.

.0012
MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE IIIB
NAGLU, ARG482TRP

In a patient with a severe form of Sanfilippo syndrome B (252920),
Tanaka et al. (2002) identified homozygosity for an arg482-to-trp
(R482W) mutation in the NAGLU gene.

.0013
MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE IIIB
NAGLU, ARG234CYS

In patients with MPS IIIB (252920), Beesley et al. (1998) identified a
C-to-T transition in the NAGLU gene, resulting in an arg234-to-cys
(R234C) substitution.

Mangas et al. (2008) identified the R234C mutation in 5 of 11 Portuguese
patients with MPS IIIB. The mutation was the most common identified in
this population, accounting for 32% of mutant alleles. Haplotype
analysis showed that the R234C mutation arose on a founder haplotype
common to both Spanish and Portuguese individuals. Mangas et al. (2008)
postulated that the mutation had a single and relatively recent origin
in the Iberian peninsula.

.0014
MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE IIIB
NAGLU, ARG565GLN

In 3 affected children in family 8600486 with severe intellectual
disability, autism spectrum disorder, and coarse facial features,
diagnosed as MPS IIIB (252920), Najmabadi et al. (2011) identified a
homozygous G-to-A transition in the NAGLU gene at genomic coordinate
Chr17:37949244 (NCBI36), resulting in an arg565-to-gln (R565Q)
substitution. Their parents, who were first cousins once removed, were
carriers.

;;CD28 ANTIGEN LIGAND 2; CD28LG2;;
B-LYMPHOCYTE ACTIVATION ANTIGEN B7-2; LAB7-2;;
B72 ANTIGEN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Induction of an immune response requires that T cells receive 2 sets of
signals from antigen-presenting cells. The first signal is delivered
through the T-cell receptor complex, while the second is provided by the
B-cell activation antigens B7-1, or CD80 (112203), and B7-2, or CD86, by
interaction with the T-cell surface molecules, CD28 (186760) and CTLA4
(123890). A cDNA for B7-2 was obtained by Freeman et al. (1993). B7-2
mRNA is constitutively expressed in unstimulated B cells. The predicted
protein is a type I membrane protein of the immunoglobin superfamily.

Jeannin et al. (2000) detected a soluble form of CD86 in human serum
that could be generated either by shedding of the membrane form or
through alternative splicing. RT-PCR analysis revealed the expression of
2 transcripts in nonstimulated monocytes but only the full-length
transmembrane form in activated monocytes. The smallest transcript, 828
bp, which the authors termed CD86deltaTM, has a deletion from nucleotide
686 to nucleotide 829 (i.e., exon 6) and encodes a 275-amino acid
protein. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis detected expression of CD86
and CD86deltaTM in COS cells as 65- and 48-kD proteins, respectively.
FACS analysis detected only CD86 transfected cells and ELISA analysis
detected only CD86deltaTM in cell-free supernatants. Binding analysis
demonstrated that CD86deltaTM binds to CD28- or CTLA4-expressing cells.
Functional analysis indicated that CD86deltaTM enhances proliferation
and cytokine production by both naive and memory T cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Resting eosinophils express neither MHC class II proteins or
costimulatory B7 molecules and fail to induce proliferation of T cells
to antigens. Celestin et al. (2001) reported that IL3 (147740) induces
expression of HLA-DR and B7.2 on eosinophils, but, unlike IL5 (147580)
and GMCSF (CSF2; 138960), it does not induce expression of B7.1.
IL3-treated eosinophils supported modest T-cell proliferation in
response to superantigen toxic shock syndrome-1 antigen, as well as
proliferation of HLA-DR-restricted T-cell clones to tetanus toxoid (TT)
and influenza virus antigenic peptides. The response was blocked by
anti-B7.2 monoclonal antibody. IL3-treated eosinophils were unable to
present native TT antigen to either resting or TT-specific cloned T
cells. Parallel experiments established that IL5 and GMCSF induce T-cell
proliferation to peptides but not to native TT antigen. Celestin et al.
(2001) suggested that eosinophils activated by IL3 may contribute to
T-cell activation in allergic and parasitic diseases by presenting
superantigens and peptides to T cells.

An immune response against thyroid carcinoma could be important for
long-term survival. Gupta et al. (2001) reported that infiltration of
thyroid carcinoma by proliferating lymphocytes is associated with
improved disease-free survival. Shah et al. (2002) hypothesized that the
antigen presentation coactivators B71 (112203) and B72, which are
important in other immune-mediated thyroid diseases, might be important
in lymphocytic infiltration of thyroid carcinoma. To test this, they
determined B71 and B72 expression by immunohistochemistry in 27
papillary (PTC; 188550) and 8 follicular (FTC; 188470) thyroid
carcinomas and 9 benign thyroid lesions. B72 expression was of similar
intensity in benign and malignant tumors, but was more intense than in
presumably normal adjacent thyroid. B72 expression also correlated with
the number of tumor-associated lymphocytes per high-power field.
Recurrence developed exclusively from tumors that expressed B72, and
intense B72 expression was associated with a reduced probability of
remission. Shah et al. (2002) concluded that these data support the
hypothesis that the antigen presentation coactivators B71 and B72 may be
important for lymphocytic infiltration and the immune response against
thyroid carcinoma.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Schwartz et al. (2001) reported the crystal structure of the complex
between the disulfide-linked homodimer of human CTLA4 (123890) and the
receptor-binding domain of human B7.2 at 3.2-angstrom resolution.

GENE STRUCTURE

Jellis et al. (1995) isolated the gene for B7-2, which is composed of 8
exons and spans more than 22 kb. The authors found that alternatively
spliced cDNAs result from the use of either exon 1 or 2. Exon 3
corresponds to the signal peptide, exon 4 to an IgV-like domain, exon 5
to an IgC-like domain and exon 6 corresponds to the transmembrane region
and part of the cytoplasmic tail. Exons 7 and 8 encode the remainder of
the tail.

MAPPING

Reeves et al. (1997) demonstrated that the CD86 and CD80 genes are
linked on human chromosome 3 and mouse chromosome 16. Reeves et al.
(1997) used fluorescence in situ hybridization mapping to show that
CD86, like CD80, maps to human 3q21 and mouse chromosome 16, band B5.

611704	TITLE *611704 TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEASE, SERINE 11A; TMPRSS11A
;;ESOPHAGEAL CANCER-RELATED GENE 1; ECRG1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Li et al. (2006) and Zhao et al. (2006) reported that they had cloned
the TMPRSS11A gene, which they called ECRG1, by mRNA differential
display of genes expressed in esophageal cancer compared to normal human
esophageal epithelia. The deduced 418-amino acid protein has
characteristics of a membrane-anchored serine protease, including the
his-asp-ser catalytic triad. RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis showed
ECRG1 expression in normal esophagus, liver, colon, and lung, with
downregulated expression in tumors, especially esophageal squamous cell
carcinomas.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhao et al. (2006) showed ECRG1 caused senescence-like changes in
transfected mouse NIH3T3 cells, including changes in cell morphology,
cell cycle arrest at the G1/S phase, and impaired cell proliferation.
Transfected cells also stained positive for a cellular senescence
marker. Telomerase activity was markedly decreased in ECRG1-expressing
cells, and expression of p21 (CDKN1A; 116899) was increased.

GENE STRUCTURE

Li et al. (2006) stated that the TMPRSS11A gene contains 10 exons and
spans about 54 kb.

MAPPING

Li et al. (2006) stated that the TMPRSS11A gene maps to chromosome
4q13.2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Li et al. (2006) reported evidence suggesting an association between an
arg290-to-gln (R290Q) SNP in exon 8 of the ECRG1 gene and increased risk

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

N-deacetylation and N-sulfation of N-acetylglucosamine residues in
heparan sulfate and heparin initiate a series of chemical modifications
that ultimately lead to oligosaccharide sequences with specific
ligand-binding properties. These reactions are catalyzed by GlcNAc
N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferases, such as NDST3, which are monomeric
enzymes with 2 catalytic activities (Aikawa and Esko, 1999).

CLONING

By searching an EST database with the nucleotide sequence of NDST1
(600853), Aikawa and Esko (1999) identified NDST3. The full-length NDST3
cDNA sequence encodes a predicted 873-amino acid type II transmembrane
protein with a 13-residue cytoplasmic domain. NDST3 shows 70% and 65%
amino acid identity with NDST1 and NDST2 (603268), respectively.
Northern blot analysis of human fetal brain poly(A)+ RNA detected an
approximately 6.4-kb NDST3 transcript. RT-PCR showed that NDST3 was
expressed in a tissue-specific manner, with highest expression in brain,
liver, and kidney.

Aikawa et al. (2001) cloned mouse Ndst3. RT-PCR detected highest Ndst3
expression in adult mouse brain, with lower expression in adult heart,
kidney, muscle, and testis, and little to no expression in other tissues
examined. Ndst3 was expressed in whole mouse embryos at all
developmental stages examined, with highest levels at embryonic day 11.

GENE FUNCTION

Aikawa and Esko (1999) found that a recombinant NDST3 fusion protein
exhibited both N-deacetylation and N-sulfation activities.

Using N-acetylheparosan purified from E. coli capsular polysaccharide as
substrate, Aikawa et al. (2001) found that recombinant mouse Ndst
enzymes showed distinct ratios of N-acetylglucosamine N-deacetylase to
N-sulfotransferase activities. Ndst3 had much higher N-deacetylase
activity than N-sulfotransferase activity against this substrate.

MAPPING

By FISH, Aikawa et al. (2001) mapped the NDST3 gene to chromosome
4q26-q27, where it lies about 300 kb from the NDST4 gene (615039) on
chromosome 4q25-q26.

EVOLUTION

Aikawa et al. (2001) determined that 3 gene duplication events likely
occurred to give rise to the 4 vertebrate NDST genes. They proposed that
after the initial gene duplication event, a duplication produced NDST1
and NDST2, followed by a much later duplication that produced NDST3 and
NDST4.

;;KIAA0375;;
IPORIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones from a size-fractionated brain cDNA library, Nagase
et al. (1997) cloned a partial RUSC2 cDNA, which they called KIAA0375.
RT-PCR detected high expression in human kidney, ovary, and testis,
followed by moderate expression in brain, placenta, lung, liver, and
skeletal muscle, and low expression in prostate and small intestine.

By yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human placental cDNA library with mutant
Rab1b (612565) as prey, Bayer et al. (2005) identified RUSC2, which they
called iporin. The deduced 1516-amino acid protein contains a RUN domain
and an SH3 domain, as well as proline and glutamic acid-rich regions.
The mouse homolog shares 84% similarity to human RUSC2. Northern blot
analysis of human tissues detected ubiquitous expression of a 5.5-kb
transcript, with highest levels in brain and testis. The RUN domain of
RUSC2 mediated binding to Rab1. Western blot analysis detected a 220-kD
protein mainly associated with membrane fractions. Immunofluorescence
microscopy showed a cytosolic distribution with punctate perinuclear
enrichment. RUSC2 interacted with the Rab1-binding protein GM130
(GOLGA2; 602580) on yeast 2-hybrid and in vitro binding assays.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bayer et al., 2005 determined that the RUSC2 gene contains 11 exons and
spans about 14 kb.

MAPPING

Bayer et al. (2005) noted that the RUSC2 gene maps to chromosome 9p13.1.

602163	TITLE *602163 UBIQUITIN-CONJUGATING ENZYME E2E 2; UBE2E2
DESCRIPTION The ubiquitin/proteasome system mediates a major pathway involved in
selective protein degradation. In this pathway, the substrate proteins
are first required to form a covalent bond with ubiquitin (191339), a
highly conserved 76-amino acid protein, before being targeted by a
proteasome. Protein ubiquitination involves 3 classes of enzymes. At
first, ubiquitin-activating enzyme (UBE1; 314370), encoded by a gene on
the X chromosome, forms a thioester bond between the C-terminal glycine
of ubiquitin and a cysteine residue of E1 in an ATP-dependent manner.
The activated ubiquitin is transferred to a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme
(e.g., UBE2H; 601082) that catalyzes the attachment of ubiquitin to a
substrate protein, often in concert with ubiquitin ligases (E3s; e.g.,
601623). E3s have been proposed to function in specific binding to
targeted substrate proteins that are not recognized by E2 enzymes. The
ubiquitin-protein conjugates are then recognized and degraded by the 26S
proteasome.

From a human B-cell library, Kimura et al. (1997) isolated a novel human
E2 enzyme, UBE2E2, with a unique N-terminal extension. The bacterially
expressed UBE2E2 protein formed an E1-dependent ubiquitin thioester.
Fluorescence in situ hybridization experiments demonstrated that the
gene is located on 3p24.2. The gene is homologous to yeast Ubc4/5.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Lai et al. (2000) identified C5ORF6 within a region of chromosome 5q
frequently deleted in malignant myelomas. The deduced 392-amino acid
protein has a calculated molecular mass of about 43 kD. The N terminus
contains a proline-rich sequence that includes 3 potential SH3
domain-binding sites. Northern blot analysis detected a 4.3-kb
transcript in all lymphoid tissues examined. C5ORF6 was also expressed
in heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and
pancreas.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Lai et al. (2000) determined that the
C4ORF6 gene contains 5 exons and spans about 11 kb.

;;BCR1
BCR/ABL FUSION GENE, INCLUDED;;
BCR/FGFR1 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED;;
BCR/PDGFRA FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The normal cellular BCR gene encodes a 160-kD phosphoprotein associated
with serine/threonine kinase activity. The BCR gene is the site of
breakpoints used in the generation of the 2 alternative forms of the
Philadelphia chromosome translocation found in chronic myeloid leukemia
(CML; 608232) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (Groffen et al., 1984;
Shtivelman et al., 1985; Hermans et al., 1987). These alternative
breakpoints join different exon sets of BCR to a common subset of the
exons of the ABL1 gene (189980) located on chromosome 9. This fusion
results in 2 alternative chimeric oncogene products called p210(BCR-ABL)
and p185(BCR-ABL). The activation of ABL tyrosine kinase activity is
necessary for the oncogenic potential of the chimeric oncogene (Maru and
Witte, 1991).

Laurent et al. (2001) reviewed the role of BCR alone or when joined with
ABL in normal and leukemic pathophysiology.

CLONING

Hariharan and Adams (1987) isolated cDNA clones that spanned the entire
BCR coding region. The deduced 1,271-residue protein has a molecular
mass of about 160 kD. The BCR gene is expressed as mRNAs of 4.5- and
6.7-kb, which apparently encode the same protein.

Stam et al. (1987) showed that the normal gene on chromosome 22 involved
at the breakpoint cluster region in the translocation between
chromosomes 9 and 22 encodes a 160,000-Da phosphoprotein with serine or
threonine kinase activity.

Chissoe et al. (1995) sequenced the complete BCR gene and greater than
80% of the human ABL gene, which are both involved in the t(9;22)
translocation (Philadelphia chromosome) associated with more than 90% of
CML, 25 to 30% of adult and 2 to 10% of childhood acute lymphoblastic
leukemia, and rare cases of acute myelogenous leukemia.

GENE STRUCTURE

Heisterkamp et al. (1985) determined the structural organization of the
BCR gene, which contains 23 exons and occupies a region of about 135 kb
on chromosome 22. The first exon contains a unique serine/threonine
kinase activity and at least two SH2 binding sites.

Stam et al. (1987) demonstrated that the BCR gene is oriented with its
5-prime end toward the centromere of chromosome 22.

Chissoe et al. (1995) determined that the BCR gene contains 23 BCR exons
with putative alternative BCR first and second exons.

MAPPING

The BCR gene is located on chromosome 22q11.2, the site of the
translocation breakpoint in CML (Prakash and Yunis, 1984).

Croce et al. (1987) demonstrated that there are in fact 4 BCR genes, all
located in the 22q11.2 band. By studying mouse-human hybrid cells with
breakpoints at various sites in that region, they concluded that the
order of loci is centromere--BCR2, BCR4, IGL--BCR1--BCR3--SIS. This
linear order was confirmed by Budarf et al. (1988), who also confirmed
that all of the BCR-like genes map proximal to the 22q11-q12 breakpoint
of a t(11;22) in a Ewing sarcoma (612219).

Using an interspecific backcross, Justice et al. (1990) mapped the Bcr
gene to chromosome 10 of the mouse.

GENE FUNCTION

Maru and Witte (1991) demonstrated that purified BCR contains
autophosphorylation activity and transphosphorylation activity for
several protein substrates. A region encoded by the first exon was
essential for this novel phosphotransferase activity. The findings
suggested that the protein kinase and SH2-binding domains may work in
concert with other regions of the molecule in intracellular signaling
processes.

Diekmann et al. (1991) found that the C-terminal domain of BCR functions
as a GTPase activating protein for p21(rac); see rac serine/threonine
protein kinase (164730).

- BCR/ABL Fusion Gene

Nowell and Hungerford (1960) identified the Philadelphia chromosome of
chronic myeloid leukemia (a G group chromosome with part of its long arm
missing). It was called the Philadelphia chromosome because it was
thought to be useful to follow the practice of hemoglobinologists and
name anomalous chromosomes after the city of discovery. It was presumed
to be a deleted chromosome 21, the same chromosome as that which is
trisomic in Down syndrome (190685). The elevated alkaline phosphatase
activity in Down syndrome and depressed activity in CML was viewed as
consistent with this interpretation. Using the improved definition
provided by 'banding' methods, Rowley (1973) showed that in fact there
is a translocation of the distal part of chromosome 22 (not 21) onto
another chromosome, usually 9q.

Fitzgerald (1976) described a family in which a man and 2 of his 3
children had a Philadelphia-like chromosome t(11;22)(q25;q13). The fact
that they did not have leukemia or other hematologic disorder was
thought by Fitzgerald to relate to the finding that the break in
chromosome 22 was distal to that in CML. In these cases it was at the
q12-q13 interface, whereas in the Philadelphia chromosome it is at the
q11-q12 band interface. Thus the 22q12 band may contain critical genetic
material concerned with normal (and abnormal) myeloid proliferation.

De Klein et al. (1982) demonstrated that the Abelson oncogene is
translocated from chromosome 9 to chromosome 22 in the formation of the
Philadelphia chromosome.

Prakash and Yunis (1984) located the breakpoints in CML to subbands
22q11.21 and 9q34.1. Although the position of the breakpoint in
chromosome 9 is quite variable, the breakpoint in chromosome 22 is
clustered in an area called bcr for 'breakpoint cluster region.'
Shtivelman et al. (1985) referred to bcr as a gene and stated that the
ABL oncogene is transferred 'into the bcr gene of chromosome 22.' They
found that an 8-kb RNA specific to CML is a fused transcript of the 2
genes. The fused protein is presumably involved in the malignant
process. The protein has bcr information at its amino terminus and
retains most but not all of the normal abl protein sequences. Since the
breakpoint in 9 may be as much as 30 or 40 kb 5-prime to ABL, a large
amount must be 'looped out' in the fusion process. The fusion protein
has tyrosine kinase activity.

About 10% of patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) have the
translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11) indistinguishable from that of CML
(608232). Erikson et al. (1986), however, found in 3 of 5 such cases of
ALL that the bcr region was not involved and that the 22q11 chromosome
breakpoint was proximal (5-prime) to the bcr region. Furthermore, the
bcr and c-abl transcripts were of normal size in an ALL line carrying
the t(9;22) translocation. The breakpoints of the t(9;22) CML, the
t(9;22) of acute lymphocytic leukemia, and the t(8;22) of Burkitt
lymphoma fall into 22q11 and are cytologically indistinguishable. By
chromosomal in situ hybridization, however, they can be distinguished
(Emanuel et al., 1984; Erikson et al., 1986). To this experience,
Griffin et al. (1986) added observations on t(11;22), both
constitutional and tumor-related (see 133450). In the hybrid gene of
CML, the bcr contribution is 5-prime to the abl contribution. In the
creation of the gene, splicing can occur across an interval as great as
100 kb. The product of the bcr/abl hybrid gene is a 210-kD protein. It
was suggested that the hybrid gene and its product protein be designated
PHL.

Mes-Masson et al. (1986) isolated overlapping cDNA clones defining the
complete coding region for the hybrid protein generated from the ABL and
BCR genes.

As a result of the CML translocation, the 3-prime BCR exons are removed
and remain on chromosome 22 (Stam et al., 1987). The BCR and ABL genes
are fused in a head-to-tail fashion.

Verhest and Monsieur (1983) found the Philadelphia chromosome in a case
of essential thrombocytopenia.

Ganesan et al. (1986) found that the BCR gene was rearranged in 7 cases
of Philadelphia chromosome-negative CML. In 5 cases hematologic findings
were indistinguishable from those of patients with the Philadelphia
chromosome.

Hermans et al. (1987) showed that a distinct and different fusion of BCR
and ABL occurs in creation of the Philadelphia chromosome associated
with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Rubin et al. (1988) similarly
reported a distinctive fusion in ALL.

Haas et al. (1992) demonstrated a 'parent of origin' bias in cases of
Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemia by use of unique specific
chromosome band polymorphisms. They showed that the translocated
chromosome 9 was always of paternal origin, whereas the translocated
chromosome 22 was derived exclusively from the maternal copy.
Preferential retention of paternal alleles has been found in sporadic
tumors such as Wilms tumor (194070), rhabdomyosarcoma (268210),
osteosarcoma (259500), and retinoblastoma (180200). The finding of
preferential participation of the paternally derived chromosome 9 and
the maternally derived chromosome 22 in the Ph-translocation strongly
indicates that the chromosomal regions involved are imprinted. Feinberg
(1993) reviewed 11 examples of preferential parental allelic alterations
in cancer. Fioretos et al. (1994) were unable to find evidence for
genomic imprinting of the human BCR gene. They identified a BamHI
polymorphism in the coding region of BCR exon 1 and by RT-PCR assay
showed that both BCR alleles are expressed in the peripheral blood cells
of normal persons. Furthermore, Litz and Copenhaver (1994) used PvuII
and MaeII restriction site polymorphisms in the BCR gene to study 3
cases of Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML. In all 3 cases, the
rearranged allele was paternal in origin. Melo et al. (1994) could find
no evidence of parental imprinting of the ABL gene and cited evidence
which appeared to exclude imprinting of the BCR gene and to suggest that
there is, in fact, no preferential involvement of the maternal BCR or
paternal ABL alleles in the formation of the BCR-ABL fusion gene. Melo
et al. (1995) further reviewed the evidence they interpreted as
indicating that there is no parental bias in the origin of the
translocated ABL gene and no evidence for genomic imprinting of ABL in
CML. On the other hand, Haas (1995) argued that it still remains likely
that ABL and BCR are imprinted.

From the sequence of 4 newly studied Philadelphia chromosome
translocations and a review of several other previously sequenced
breakpoints, Chissoe et al. (1995) could discern no consistent
breakpoint features. No clear-cut mechanism for Philadelphia chromosome
translocation was evident.

To block BCR/ABL function, Lim et al. (2000) created a unique tyrosine
phosphatase by fusing the catalytic domain of SHP1 (604630) to the ABL
binding domain of RIN1 (605965), an established binding partner and
substrate for c-ABL and BCR/ABL. This fusion construct binds to BCR/ABL
in cells and functions as an active phosphatase. It effectively
suppressed BCR/ABL function as judged by reductions in transformation of
fibroblast cells, growth factor independence of hematopoietic cell
lines, and proliferation of primary bone marrow cells. In addition, the
leukemogenic properties of BCR/ABL in a murine model system were blocked
by coexpression of the fusion construct. Expression of the construct
also reversed the transformed phenotype of a human leukemia-derived cell
line. These results appeared to have direct implications for leukemia
therapeutics and suggested an approach to block aberrant signal
transduction in other pathologies through the use of appropriately
designed escort/inhibitors.

Saglio et al. (2002) found that a patient with a typical form of CML
carried a large deletion on the derivative chromosome 9q+ and an unusual
BCR-BCL transcript characterized by the insertion, between BCR exon 14
and ABL exon 2, of 126 bp derived from a region located on chromosome 9,
1.4 Mb 5-prime to ABL. This sequence was contained in a bacterial
artificial chromosome (BAC), which in FISH experiments on normal
metaphases was found to detect, in addition to the predicted clear
signal at 9q34, a faint but distinct signal at 22q11.2, where the BCR
gene is located, suggesting the presence of a large region of homology
between the 2 chromosome regions. A BLAST analysis of the particular BAC
sequence against the entire human genome revealed the presence of a
stretch of homology, about 76 kb long, located approximately 150 kb
3-prime to the BCR gene, and containing the 126-bp insertion sequence.
Evolutionary studies using FISH identified the region as a duplicon,
which transposed from the region orthologous to human 9q34 to chromosome
22 after the divergence of orangutan from the human-chimpanzee-gorilla
common ancestor about 14 million years ago. Saglio et al. (2002) noted
that sequence analyses reported as part of the Human Genome Project had
disclosed an unpredicted extensive segmental duplication in the human
genome, and the impact of duplicons in triggering genomic disorders is
becoming more and more apparent. The discovery of a large duplicon
relatively close to the ABL and BCR genes and the finding that the
126-bp insertion is very close to the duplicon at 9q34 open the question
of the possible involvement of the duplicon in the formation of the
Philadelphia chromosome translocation.

The arrest of differentiation is a feature of chronic myelogenous
leukemia cells both in myeloid blast crisis and in myeloid precursors
that ectopically express the p210(BCR-ABL) oncoprotein. Related to the
underlying mechanisms of this arrest of differentiation, Perrotti et al.
(2002) showed that expression of BCR-ABL in myeloid precursor cells
leads to transcriptional suppression of the gene encoding granulocyte
colony-stimulating factor receptor (CSF3R; 138971), possibly through
downmodulation of C/EBP-alpha (116897), the principal regulator of
granulocytic differentiation. Expression of C/EBP-alpha protein is
barely detectable in primary marrow cells taken from individuals
affected with chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis. In contrast,
CEBPA RNA is clearly present. Further experiments by Perrotti et al.
(2002) indicated that BCR-ABL regulates the expression of C/EBP-alpha by
inducing heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein E2 (PCBP2; 601210).

RNA interference (RNAi) is a highly conserved regulatory mechanism that
mediates sequence-specific posttranscriptional gene silencing initiated
by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) (Fire, 1999). Fusion transcripts encoding
oncogenic proteins may represent potential targets for a tumor-specific
RNAi approach. Scherr et al. (2003) demonstrated that small interfering
RNAs (siRNAs) against BCR-ABL specifically inhibited expression of
BCR-ABL mRNA in hematopoietic cell lines and primary CML cells.

Goldman and Melo (2003) tabulated BCR-ABL substrates and diagrammed the
signal-transduction pathways affected by BCR-ABL.

To define oncogenic lesions that cooperate with BCR-ABL1 to induce ALL,
Mullighan et al. (2008) performed a genomewide analysis of diagnostic
leukemia samples from 304 individuals with ALL, including 43 BCR-ABL1
B-progenitor ALLs and 23 CML cases. IKZF1, encoding the transcription
factor Ikaros (603023), was deleted in 83.7% of BCR-ABL1 ALL, but not in
chronic phase CML. Deletion of IKZF1 was also identified as an acquired
lesion at the time of transformation of CML to ALL (lymphoid blast
crisis). The IKZF1 deletions resulted in haploinsufficiency, expression
of a dominant-negative Ikaros isoform, or the complete loss of Ikaros
expression. Sequencing of IKZF1 deletion breakpoints suggested that
aberrant RAG-mediated recombination (see 179615) is responsible for the
deletions. Mullighan et al. (2008) concluded that genetic lesions
resulting in the loss of Ikaros function are an important event in the
development of BCR-ABL1 ALL.

Zhao et al. (2009) demonstrated that the loss of Smoothened (Smo;
601500), an essential component of the hedgehog pathway (see 600725),
impairs hematopoietic stem cell renewal and decreases induction of
chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML; 608232) by the BCR-ABL1 oncoprotein.
Loss of Smo causes depletion of CML stem cells, which propagate the
leukemia, whereas constitutively active Smo augments CML stem cell
number and accelerates disease. As a possible mechanism for Smo action,
Zhao et al. (2009) showed that the cell fate determinant Numb (603728),
which depletes CML stem cells, is increased in the absence of Smo
activity. Furthermore, pharmacologic inhibition of hedgehog signaling
impairs not only the propagation of CML driven by wildtype BCR-ABL1, but
also the growth of imatinib-resistant mouse and human CML. Zhao et al.
(2009) concluded that hedgehog pathway activity is required for
maintenance of normal and neoplastic stem cells of the hematopoietic
system and raised the possibility that the drug resistance and disease
recurrence associated with imatinib treatment of CML might be avoided by
targeting this essential stem cell maintenance pathway.

Resistance of Bcr-Abl-positive leukemic stem cells (LSCs) to imatinib
treatment in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; 608232) can
cause relapse of disease and might be the origin for emerging
drug-resistant clones. Dierks et al. (2008) identified Smo as a drug
target in Bcr-Abl-positive LSCs. They showed that Hedgehog signaling is
activated in LSCs through upregulation of Smo. While nullity for Smo
does not affect long-term reconstitution of regular hematopoiesis, the
development of retransplantable Bcr-Abl-positive leukemias was abolished
in the absence of Smo expression. Pharmacologic Smo inhibition reduced
LSCs in vivo and enhanced time to relapse after end of treatment. Dierks
et al. (2008) postulated that Smo inhibition might be an effective
treatment strategy to reduce the LSC pool in CML.

Using xenografting and DNA copy number alteration (CNA) profiling of
human BCR-ABL1 lymphoblastic leukemia, Notta et al. (2011) demonstrated
that genetic diversity occurs in functionally defined
leukemia-initiating cells and that many diagnostic patient samples
contain multiple genetically distinct leukemia-initiating cell
subclones. Reconstructing the subclonal genetic ancestry of several
samples by CNA profiling demonstrated a branching multiclonal evolution
model of leukemogenesis, rather than linear succession. For some patient
samples, the predominant diagnostic clone repopulated xenografts,
whereas in others it was outcompeted by minor subclones. Reconstitution
with the predominant diagnosis clone was associated with more aggressive
growth properties in xenografts, deletion of CDKN2A (600160) and CDKN2B
(600431), and a trend towards poorer patient outcome. Notta et al.
(2011) concluded that their findings linked clonal diversity with
leukemia-initiating cell function and underscored the importance of
developing therapies that eradicate all intratumoral subclones.

- BCR/FGFR1 Fusion Gene

Demiroglu et al. (2001) described 2 patients with a clinical and
hematologic diagnosis of CML in chronic phase who had an acquired
t(8;22)(p11;q11). They confirmed that both patients were negative for a
BCR-ABL fusion gene and that both had an in-frame mRNA fusion between
BCR exon 4 and FGFR1 (136350) exon 9. Thus, a BCR-FGFR1 fusion may occur
in patients with apparently typical CML. The possibility of successful
treatment with specific FGFR1 inhibitors was suggested.

- BCR/PDGFRA Fusion Gene

Baxter et al. (2002) reported the identification and cloning of a rare
variant translocation, t(4;22)(q12;q11), in 2 patients with a CML-like
myeloproliferative disease. An unusual in-frame BCR/PDGFRA (173490)
fusion mRNA was identified in both patients, with either BCR exon 7 or
exon 12 fused to short BCR intron-derived sequences, which were in turn
fused to part of PDGFRA exon 12. Sequencing of the genomic breakpoint
junctions showed that the chromosome 22 breakpoints fell in BCR introns,
whereas the chromosome 4 breakpoints were within PDGFRA exon 12.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Resistance to Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors

Clinical studies with the Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 in CML
demonstrated that many patients with advanced-stage disease respond
initially but then relapse. Through biochemical and molecular analysis
of clinical material, Gorre et al. (2001) found that the drug resistance
was associated with a reactivation of BCR-ABL signal transduction in all
cases examined. In 6 of 9 patients, resistance was associated with a
single amino acid substitution in a threonine residue of the Abl kinase
domain known to form a critical hydrogen bond with the drug. This
substitution (T315I; 189980.0001) was sufficient to confer STI571
resistance in a reconstitution experiment. In 3 patients, resistance was
associated with progressive BCR-ABL gene amplification. Gorre et al.
(2001) concluded that their studies provided evidence that genetically
complex cancers retain dependence on an initial oncogenic event and
suggested a strategy for identifying inhibitors of STI571 resistance.

Azam et al. (2003) stated that sequencing of the BCR-ABL gene in
patients who relapsed after STI571 chemotherapy revealed a limited set
of kinase domain mutations that mediate drug resistance. To obtain a
more comprehensive survey of the amino acid substitutions that confer
STI571 resistance, they performed an in vitro screen of randomly
mutagenized BCR-ABL and recovered all the major mutations previously
identified in patients and numerous others that illuminated novel
mechanisms of acquired drug resistance. Structural modeling implied that
a novel class of variants acts allosterically to destabilize the
autoinhibited conformation of the ABL kinase, to which STI571
preferentially binds. The authors concluded that this screening strategy
is a paradigm applicable to a growing list of target-directed anticancer
agents and provides a means of anticipating the drug-resistant amino
acid substitutions that are likely to be clinically problematic.

Resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) develops in virtually
all cases of Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic
leukemia. Duy et al. (2011) reported the discovery of a novel mechanism
of drug resistance that is based on protective feedback signaling of
leukemia cells in response to treatment with TKIs. In Philadelphia
chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells, Duy et al.
(2011) identified BCL6 (109565) as a central component of this
drug-resistance pathway and demonstrated that targeted inhibition of
BCL6 leads to eradication of drug-resistant and leukemia-initiating
subclones.

ANIMAL MODEL

To determine whether the P210(bcr/abl) hybrid protein can induce
leukemia, Daley et al. (1990) infected murine bone marrow with a
retrovirus encoding this protein and transplanted the bone marrow into
irradiated syngeneic recipients. Transplant recipients developed several
hematologic malignancies, prominent among which was a myeloproliferative
syndrome closely resembling the chronic phase of human chronic
myelogenous leukemia. Tumor tissue from diseased mice harbored the
provirus encoding P210(bcr/abl). Heisterkamp et al. (1990) satisfied
Koch postulates in relation to leukemia by demonstrating leukemia in
mice transgenic for a bcr/abl p190 construct of the type found in acute
lymphoblastic leukemia. Tkachuk et al. (1990) used 2-color fluorescence
in situ hybridization (FISH) with probes from portions of the BCR and
ABL (189980) genes to detect the BCR-ABL fusion in individual blood and
bone marrow cells from 6 patients. The fusion event was detected in all
samples analyzed, of which 3 were cytogenetically Ph(1)-negative. One of
the Ph(1)-negative samples was also PCR-negative.

When the Philadelphia-chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia-blast
crisis cell line BV173 is injected into SCID mice, a disease process
closely resembling that seen in leukemia patients results (Kamel-Reid et
al., 1989). For example, BCR-ABL transcripts are detectable in bone
marrow, spleen, peripheral blood, liver, and lungs. Skorski et al.
(1994) found that systemic treatment of the leukemic mice with a 26-mer
BCR-ABL antisense oligodeoxynucleotide induced disappearance of leukemic
cells and a marked decrease in BCR-ABL mRNA in mouse tissues. Untreated
mice or mice treated with a BCR-ABL sense oligodeoxynucleotide or a
6-base-mismatched antisense oligodeoxynucleotide were dead 8 to 13 weeks
after leukemia cell injection; in marked contrast, mice treated with
BCR-ABL antisense oligodeoxynucleotide died of leukemia 18 to 23 weeks
after injection of leukemic cells. Findings were interpreted as
indicating the in vivo effectiveness of an anticancer therapy based on
antisense oligodeoxynucleotides targeting a tumor-specific gene.

Cancer is thought to arise from multiple genetic events that establish
irreversible malignancy. A different mechanism might be present in
certain leukemias initiated by a chromosomal translocation. Huettner et
al. (2000) adopted a new approach to determine if ablation of the
genetic abnormality is sufficient for reversion. They generated a
conditional transgenic model of BCR-ABL-induced leukemia. The most
common form of the product of the fusion gene, p210 BCR-ABL1, is found
in more than 90% of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia and in up
to 15% of adult patients with de novo acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
Efforts to establish a useful transgenic model had been hampered by
embryonic lethality when the oncogene is expressed during embryogenesis,
by reduced penetrance, or by extremely long latency. Huettner et al.
(2000) used the 'knock-in' approach to induce leukemia by p190 BCR-ABL1
(Castellanos et al., 1997). Lethal leukemia developed within an
acceptable time frame in all animals, and complete remission was
achieved by suppression of BCR-ABL1 expression, even after multiple
rounds of induction and reversion. The results demonstrated that
BCR-ABL1 is required for both induction and maintenance of leukemia. The
findings suggested that complete and lasting remissions can be achieved
if the genetic abnormality is abolished or silenced before secondary
mutations are acquired. The results have implications for therapies that
directly target leukemia oncogenes, with a relevant example being the
use of BCR-ABL1-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

Tanabe et al. (2000) designed a ribozyme which exclusively targets the
junction sequence of BCR-ABL and showed that it specifically cleaves the
BCR-ABL mRNA, inducing apoptosis in CML cells. Tanabe et al. (2000)
tested this technology in vivo by embedding genes encoding the maxizyme
downstream of genes for the human tRNA. They used a retroviral system
for the expression of the maxizyme in leukemic cells. A line of CML
cells was transduced either with a control vector in which the maxizyme
sequence had been deleted or with the maxizyme-encoding vector. They
then injected 2 x 10(6) transduced cells into the tail veins of NOD-SCID
mice. Animals transduced with the control vector died between 6 and 13
weeks afterwards due to diffuse leukemia. Animals treated with the
BCR-ABL ribozyme all survived, with no evidence of leukemia in 8 animals
8 weeks after inoculation. Tanabe et al. (2000) stated that their
maxizyme could be useful for purging bone marrow in cases of CML treated
by autologous transplantation, when it would presumably reduce the
incidence of relapse by decreasing the tumorigenicity of contaminating
CML cells in the transplant.

Voncken et al. (1995) found that exposure of Bcr-null mice to
gram-negative endotoxin led to severe septic shock and increased tissue
injury by neutrophils. Neutrophils of Bcr-null mice showed a pronounced
increase in reactive oxygen metabolite production upon activation and
were more sensitive to priming stimuli. Activated Bcr-null neutrophils
displayed a 3-fold increase in Rac2 (602049) membrane translocation
compared with wildtype neutrophils. The results showed that BCR is
involved in the regulation of RAC-mediated superoxide production by the
NADPH-oxidase system (see NOX1; 300225) of leukocytes and suggested a
link between BCR function and the cell type affected in Philadelphia
chromosome-positive leukemias.

607939	TITLE *607939 SULFATASE-MODIFYING FACTOR 1; SUMF1
;;C-ALPHA-FORMYLGLYCINE-GENERATING ENZYME; FGE;;
FGLY-GENERATING ENZYME
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The SUMF1 gene encodes an enzyme required for posttranslational
modification and catalytic activation of the family of sulfatase
enzymes. Sulfatase enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of sulfate esters
such as glycosaminoglycans, sulfolipids, and steroid sulfates.
C-alpha-formylglycine (FGly), the catalytic residue in the active site
of eukaryotic sulfatases, is posttranslationally generated from a
cysteine by SUMF1, the FGly-generating enzyme (FGE), in the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) (summary by Roeser et al. (2006)).

CLONING

Dierks et al. (2003) purified FGE from bovine testis. By searching
sequence databases and RT-PCR using fibroblast RNA, they isolated a
human cDNA encoding FGE, which they designated SUMF1. The deduced
374-amino acid protein contains a 33-residue signal sequence and an
N-glycosylation site, and it has a tripartite domain structure. SUMF1 is
conserved in prokaryotes and eukaryotes and shares 87% and 94% amino
acid identity with its mouse and rat orthologs, respectively. Northern
blot analysis detected a 2.1-kb transcript in heart, brain, placenta,
lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas, as well as in skin
fibroblasts. Expression was highest in pancreas and kidney and lowest in
brain. Immunofluorescence analysis showed colocalization of SUMF1 with a
luminal protein of the ER. Western blot analysis indicated that SUMF1
has an apparent molecular mass of 42 to 44 kD.

Independently, Cosma et al. (2003) identified the SUMF1 gene by
functional complementation using microcell-mediated chromosome transfer.
A SUMF1 paralog, SUMF2 (607940), shares 48% amino acid identity with
SUMF1. Northern blot analysis detected SUMF1 expression in all tissues
tested, with highest levels in kidney and liver.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Dierks et al. (2003) determined that the
SUMF1 gene has 9 exons and spans 105 kb. The exon-intron structure is
conserved in mouse.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Dierks et al. (2003) mapped the SUMF1 gene
to chromosome 3p26. They mapped the mouse Sumf1 gene to chromosome 6E2
in a region that shows homology of synteny to human chromosome 3p26.

GENE FUNCTION

Cosma et al. (2003) observed functional conservation of SUMF1 among
distantly related species, suggesting a critical biologic role.
Coexpression of SUMF1 with sulfatases resulted in a synergistic increase
of enzymatic activity, indicating that SUMF1 is both an essential and a
limiting factor for sulfatases. The authors concluded that these data
have implications on the feasibility of enzyme replacement therapy for 8
distinct inborn errors of metabolism.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Roeser et al. (2006) stated that cys336 and cys341 within the active
site are involved in the catalytic action of FGE. They examined the
crystal structure of cys336-to-ser and cys341-to-ser mutants of FGE, as
well as wildtype FGE modified by an SH-reactive agent or binding a
peptide substrate. Their observations confirmed that the cys336/cys341
pair does not form a disulfide bond, predominantly due to the redox
activity of cys336, which is fully oxidized to sulfonic acid in the
wildtype enzyme. The negative potential of cys336 allows it to react
with molecular oxygen as part of a novel oxygenase mechanism that does
not rely on any cofactors. A substrate binding groove borders the
cys336/cys341 pair, and cys341 stabilizes the substrate by forming a
disulfide bond with a cysteine within the substrate peptide sequence.
The binding groove requires the substrate to be elongated, providing
further evidence that sulfatase modification in the ER occurs before
folding.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Dierks et al. (2003) identified 9 mutations in the SUMF1 gene in 7
patients with multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD; 272200). The activity
of sulfatases was partially restored in patient fibroblasts by
transduction of SUMF1-encoding cDNA, but not by cDNA carrying an MSD
mutation.

Cosma et al. (2003) identified several mutations in the SUMF1 gene in 12
unrelated patients with MSD. They showed that SUMF1 was able to rescue
the enzymatic deficiency in patients' cell lines.

In 20 patients with MSD of different ethnic origins, Cosma et al. (2004)
performed mutation analysis of the SUMF1 gene. The clinical presentation
of these patients was variable, ranging from severe neonatal forms to
mild phenotypes showing mild neurologic involvement. Twenty-two SUMF1
mutations were identified, including missense, nonsense, microdeletion,
and splicing mutations. All missense mutations were expressed in culture
to study their ability to enhance the activity of sulfatases. In 11
cases the predicted amino acid changes resulted in severely impaired
sulfatase-enhancing activity. In the case of 2 mutations, high residual
activity was observed on some, but not all, of the 9 sulfatases tested,
suggesting that some SUMF1 mutations may have variable effects on the
activity of each sulfatase.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Schlotawa et al. (2011) observed clear genotype/phenotype correlations
among 10 patients with multiple sulfatase deficiency, including 1 with
neonatal onset, 7 with severe late-infantile onset, and 2 with mild
late-infantile onset. The most severely affected patient with neonatal
onset had marked impairments in both SUMF1 stability and enzyme activity
and was compound heterozygous for a splice site and a nonsense mutation
(607939.0001 and 607939.0003, respectively). Sulfatase activities in
this patient were almost undetectable. In contrast, 2 patients with mild
late-infantile onset were homozygous for a missense mutation (G263V;
607939.0018), which showed the highest residual enzymatic activity among
the studied variants despite decreased stability. Patients with the
intermediate severe late-infantile form had mutations that compromised
stability and caused low levels of residual activity (see, e.g., S155P;
607939.0010).

ANIMAL MODEL

Settembre et al. (2007) found that Sumf1-null mice displayed early
mortality, congenital growth retardation, skeletal abnormalities, and
neurologic deficits, similar to human patients with MSD. Massive
lysosomal storage of glycosaminoglycans was observed in all tissues
examined and was associated with systemic inflammation, apoptosis, and
neurodegeneration. Sumf1-null mice completely lacked all sulfatase
activities, indicating that mammals have a single sulfatase modification
system.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MULTIPLE SULFATASE DEFICIENCY
SUMF1, IVS3DS, 4-BP DEL, +5

In 2 patients with multiple sulfatase deficiency (272200), Dierks et al.
(2003) and Cosma et al. (2003) identified heterozygosity for a 4-bp
deletion (GTAA) at position +5 of intron 3 of the SUMF1 gene. The
mutation destroyed the splice donor site of intron 3, resulting in an
in-frame deletion of exon 3 (residues 149 to 173). Dierks et al. (2003)
referred to the mutation as IVS3+5-8del, while Cosma et al. (2003)
referred to it as 519+4delGTAA. The first patient also had a C-to-A
transversion at nucleotide 1076, resulting in a ser359-to-ter
substitution (S359X; 607939.0002), and the second patient had a C-to-T
transition at nucleotide 979, resulting in an arg327-to-ter substitution
(R327X; 607939.0003).

Schlotawa et al. (2011) reported a patient with severe neonatal onset of
multiple sulfatase deficiency who was compound heterozygous for the
intron 3 mutation and R327X (607939.0003). Both mutations were predicted
to be null mutations, but the splice site mutation was shown to retain
about 0.3% residual activity. Patient fibroblasts showed severely
reduced levels of SUMF1.

In patients with multiple sulfatase deficiency (272200), Dierks et al.
(2003) and Cosma et al. (2003) identified homozygosity for a C-to-T
transition at nucleotide 1045 of the SUMF1 gene, resulting in the
substitution of a conserved amino acid, arg349 to trp (R349W).

transition at nucleotide 1046 of the SUMF1 gene, resulting in the
substitution of a conserved amino acid, arg349 to gln (R349Q). The
second mutation was a T-to-C transition at nucleotide 1006, resulting in
the substitution of a conserved amino acid, cys336 to arg (C336R;

SUMF1, ALA279VAL

In a patient with multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD; 272200), Dierks et
al. (2003) identified heterozygosity for a C-to-T transition at
nucleotide 836 of the SUMF1 gene, resulting in the substitution of a
conserved amino acid, ala279 to val (A279V). The second mutation was a
frameshift deletion of 1 bp (C) at nucleotide 243 (607939.0008),
resulting in a truncated protein.

In a patient with moderate MSD, Cosma et al. (2003) identified
heterozygosity for the A279V mutation and a 1-bp deletion (A) at
position -2 of intron 5 (603-2delA; 607939.0016), resulting in skipping
of exon 5.

In a patient with severe neonatal multiple sulfatase deficiency
(272200), Dierks et al. (2003) and Cosma et al. (2003) identified
heterozygosity for a frameshift deletion of 1 bp (G) at nucleotide 661
of the SUMF1 gene, resulting in a truncated protein. The second mutation
in this patient was not identified.

.0010
MULTIPLE SULFATASE DEFICIENCY
SUMF1, SER155PRO

In 2 patients with multiple sulfatase deficiency (272200), Cosma et al.
(2003) identified homozygosity for a T-to-C transition at nucleotide 463
of the SUMF1 gene, resulting in a ser155-to-pro substitution (S155P).

Schlotawa et al. (2011) reported 3 patients with severe late-infantile
onset of multiple sulfatase deficiency who were homozygous for the S155P
mutation. In vitro functional expression studies in fibrosarcoma cells
showed that the mutant protein had reduced expression and was unstable,
but localized to the ER and retained about 1.6% residual catalytic
activity compared to wildtype. The mutant protein was not secreted into
the medium, indicating that it was retained inside the cell and
degraded, resulted in a loss of function. Patient fibroblasts showed
severely reduced levels of SUMF1.

SUMF1, MET1ARG

In a patient with multiple sulfatase deficiency (272200), Cosma et al.
(2003) identified heterozygosity for a T-to-G transversion at nucleotide
2 of the SUMF1 gene, resulting in substitution of the initiator met
codon, met1 to arg (M1R). The second mutation was a frameshift deletion
of 1 bp (C) at nucleotide 276, resulting in a truncated protein.

In 2 patients with multiple sulfatase deficiency (272200), Cosma et al.
(2003) identified a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 1033 of the SUMF1
gene, resulting in an arg345-to-cys substitution (R345C). One patient
was homozygous for the R345C mutation, while the other was heterozygous
for R345C and a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 653, resulting in a
cys218-to-tyr substitution (C218Y; 607939.00015).

Schlotawa et al. (2011) reported a patient with severe late-infantile
onset of multiple sulfatase deficiency who was homozygous for the R345C
mutation. In vitro functional expression studies in fibrosarcoma cells
showed that the mutant protein had normal expression and localized
correctly to the ER, but was unstable and was secreted into the medium,
The mutant protein retained about 2.0% residual catalytic activity
compared to wildtype. Patient fibroblasts showed severely reduced levels
of SUMF1.

In a patient with multiple sulfatase deficiency (272200), Cosma et al.
(2003) identified heterozygosity for a G-to-C transversion at nucleotide
1042 of the SUMF1 gene, resulting in an ala348-to-pro substitution
(A348P). The second mutation was an A-to-G transition at nucleotide 1,
resulting in a met1-to-val substitution (M1V; 607939.0017).

SUMF1, GLY263VAL

In 2 patients with mild late-infantile onset of multiple sulfatase
deficiency (272200), Schlotawa et al. (2011) identified a homozygous
788G-T transversion in the SUMF1 gene, resulting in a gly263-to-val
(G263V) substitution in a highly conserved residues. In vitro functional
expression studies showed that the mutant protein was expressed,
correctly localized to the ER, and was secreted. However, the mutant
protein showed decreased stability and reduced activity, at about 16%
compared to wildtype. Patient fibroblasts showed reduced levels of
SUMF1, but there were residual activities of several sulfatases.
Schlotawa et al. (2011) suggested that the milder phenotype in these
patients resulted from residual enzymatic activity.

608991	TITLE *608991 MASTERMIND-LIKE 3; MAML3
;;MASTERMIND, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 2; MAM2;;
KIAA1816
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2001) cloned MAML3, which they called KIAA1816.
The deduced protein contains 1,162 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA detected
high expression in ovary, with moderate to high expression in all other
adult and fetal tissues and specific adult brain regions examined.

By searching databases using the basic domain of MAML1 (605424) as
probe, Wu et al. (2002) identified MAML2 (607537) and MAML3. The deduced
1,133-amino acid MAML3 protein has a calculated molecular mass of 115
kD. All 3 MAML proteins contain a conserved N-terminal basic domain, but
the rest of the sequences are rather divergent. In addition, all 3 are
proline- and glutamine-rich, and MAML2 and MAML3 contain several
glutamine stretches. Northern blot analysis detected wide expression of
MAML2 and MAML3 transcripts of about 7.5 kb. Fluorescence-tagged MAML
proteins were expressed in a speckled nuclear staining pattern in
transfected COS-7 and osteosarcoma cells, with considerable
heterogeneity in the size of the dots.

Lin et al. (2002) also identified MAML2 and MAML3, which they called
MAM3 and MAM2, respectively, based on sequence similarity with MAML1.
All 3 proteins have an N-terminal basic domain, a central acidic domain,
and a C-terminal acidic domain. Northern blot analysis detected
widespread expression of a 7.9-kb MAML3 transcript.

GENE FUNCTION

Wu et al. (2002) found that MAML1, MAML2, and MAML3 bound to the ankyrin
repeat domain of NOTCH1 (190198), although MAML3 bound less efficiently.
They determined that all 3 MAML proteins contain a C-terminal
transcriptional activation domain. Coimmunoprecipitation assays showed
that each MAML protein could form multiprotein complexes with the
intracellular domain of each Notch receptor and CSL DNA-binding factors
(e.g., CBF1; 147183) in vivo. The MAML proteins varied somewhat in their
ability to cooperate with different Notch receptors to function as
coactivators in Notch signaling. MAML1 and MAML2 amplified Notch
ligand-induced transcription of the target HES1 gene (139605), whereas
MAML3 displayed little effect.

Lin et al. (2002) found that the MAML proteins stabilized and
participated in the Notch/CSL DNA-binding complex and enhanced the
activation of transcription from the target promoter. They found that
activation of the target promoter by NOTCH3 (600276) and NOTCH4 (164951)
was more efficiently potentiated by MAML3 than by MAML1 or MAML2.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2001) mapped the MAML3
gene to chromosome 4. By genomic sequence analysis, Wu et al. (2002)
mapped the MAML3 gene to chromosome 4q28.3.

613381	TITLE *613381 CYSTATHIONINE BETA-SYNTHASE; CBS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The CBS gene encodes cystathionine beta-synthase (EC 4.2.1.22), which
catalyzes the first irreversible step of transsulfuration. The enzyme
conjugates homocysteine and serine to form cystathionine, which is
subsequently converted into cysteine and alpha-ketobutyrate.
Homocysteine can also undergo remethylation to form methionine. The CBS
enzyme is a homotetramer of 63-kD subunits and requires pyridoxal
phosphate and heme for activity. It can also be stimulated by the
addition of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) (Kraus et al., 1993; Shan et
al., 2001).

CLONING

Kraus et al. (1993) cloned the human CBS gene from a human liver cDNA
library. The deduced 551-residue protein showed about 90% identity with
the rat protein. Northern blot analysis identified a major 2.7-kb mRNA
transcript.

Chasse et al. (1995) isolated clones corresponding to the CBS gene from
a human liver cDNA library. The gene is expressed as a 2.5-kb mRNA
species mostly in liver and pancreas, with faint expression in brain,
heart, kidney and lung. In addition, a 3.7-kb transcript was found in
pancreas and liver.

Using in situ hybridization and Northern blot analysis, Robert et al.
(2003) found expression of the Cbs gene in early mouse development in
the liver and in the skeletal, cardiac, and nervous systems. Expression
declined in the nervous system in the late embryonic stages, whereas it
increased in the brain after birth, peaking during cerebellar
development. In the adult brain, expression was strongest in the
Purkinje cell layer and in the hippocampus. Immunohistochemical analyses
showed that the Cbs protein was localized in most areas of the brain,
but predominantly in the cell bodies and neuronal processes of Purkinje
cells and Ammon's horn neurons.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chasse et al. (1997) reported that the human CBS gene spans over 30 kb
and contains 19 exons. There are 3 different 5-prime untranslated
regions, including 3 different exons 1: exon 1a, 1b, and 1c. Exons 1a
and 1b are 390 bp apart and are linked to exon 2 in cDNAs reported by
the authors. Exon 1c, which is linked to exon 5 in another cDNA, is 7 kb
from exon 1b. All splice sites conform to the GT/AG rule, including
those from exon 1a or 1b to exon 2 and from exon 1c to exon 5. Their
results suggested that the mRNAs containing the different exons 1 are
under the control of different promoters.

By genomic sequence analysis, Kraus et al. (1998) determined that the
CBS gene contains 23 exons, ranging in size from 42 to 299 bp. The
5-prime UTR is formed by 1 of 5 alternatively used exons and 1
invariably present exon. The 3-prime UTR is encoded by exons 16 and 17.
Kraus et al. (1998) also described 2 alternatively used GC-rich promoter
regions. The authors noted that the CBS locus contains an unusually high
number of Alu repeats and suggested that these may predispose the gene
to deleterious rearrangements.

MAPPING

Studying somatic cell hybrids between human fibroblasts with normal
cystathionine beta-synthase activity and hamster cells without this
enzyme activity, Skovby et al. (1984) found that enzyme activity
cosegregated with chromosome 21. No enzyme activity was found in
homocystinuric fibroblasts.

By in situ hybridization, Munke et al. (1985) assigned the CBS locus to
chromosome 21q22. Using a rat cDNA probe for in situ hybridization to
structurally rearranged chromosomes 21, Munke et al. (1988) assigned CBS
to the subtelomeric region of band 21q22.3.

Chadefaux et al. (1985) demonstrated a dosage effect for CBS enzymatic
activity in fibroblasts from patients trisomic for chromosome 21, and in
cases of deletion and partial trisomy found levels of activity
consistent with location of the CBS locus between 21q22.1 and 21q21.

Munke et al. (1988) mapped the mouse gene to the proximal half of
chromosome 17 by Southern analysis of hamster-mouse somatic cell hybrid
DNA.

Stubbs et al. (1990) demonstrated that the murine equivalents of the CBS
and CRYA1 (123580) genes are very closely situated on mouse chromosome
17 in a segment not larger than 130 kb. Most of the genes concentrated
in band 21q22, which may be relevant to the phenotype of Down syndrome,
are located on mouse chromosome 16 or mouse chromosome 10. The close
physical linkage of the mouse equivalents of CBS and CRYA1, combined
with data that localize closely flanking mouse markers to human
chromosome 6, suggest that the human 21q22/mouse chromosome 17 conserved
segment is of limited physical size and contains a small number of Down
syndrome-related genes.

Avramopoulos et al. (1993) used single-strand conformation polymorphism
(SSCP) to detect DNA polymorphisms in the 3-prime untranslated region of
the CBS gene. Using one of these for linkage studies in CEPH families,
they placed the CBS gene on human chromosome 21.

GENE FUNCTION

The human CBS protein can substitute for the endogenous yeast CBS
protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Kruger and Cox, 1994).

Heme may be necessary for binding of pyridoxal 5-prime phosphate to CBS
and for correct CBS folding (Kery et al., 1999).

The catalytic domain of the CBS protein is located in the N-terminal 409
amino acids, and a regulatory domain is located in the C-terminal 142
amino acids. Using the Kruger-Cox yeast system for studying human CBS
gene function, Shan and Kruger (1998) reported that a mutation that
deletes the C-terminal 145 amino acids of CBS could restore activity of
several CBS mutant alleles found in homocystinurics. This C-terminal
domain must thus act to inhibit enzymatic activity. In addition, the
C-terminal domain is in turn regulated by S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet),
a positive effector of CBS. Shan and Kruger (1998) suggested that most
mutations in patients with homocystinuria do not cause dysfunction of
the catalytic domain, but rather interfere with the activation of the
enzyme. These findings suggested a new drug target to treat
homocystinuria and homocysteine-related vascular disease. Shan et al.
(2001) used a yeast genetic screen to identify missense mutations in the
C-terminal region of CBS that could suppress the most common patient
mutation, I278T (613381.0004). Seven suppressor mutations were
identified, 4 of which mapped to the C-terminal regulatory domain. When
combined in cis with another pathogenic mutation, val168-to-met (V168M;
613381.0011), 6 of 7 of the suppressor mutations rescued the yeast
phenotype. Enzyme activity analyses indicated that the suppressors
restored activity from less than 2% to 17 to 64% of the wildtype levels.
Analysis of the suppressor mutations in the absence of the pathogenic
mutation showed that 6 of the 7 suppressor alleles had lost enzymatic
responsiveness to S-adenosylmethionine. Using homology modeling, the
suppressor mutations appeared to map on one face of the regulatory
domain. The authors concluded that subtle changes to the C terminus of
CBS may restore activity to mutant proteins, which could provide a
rationale for screening for compounds that could activate mutant CBS
alleles.

The CBS gene on chromosome 21 is overexpressed in patients with trisomy
21 (190685). Pogribna et al. (2001) evaluated homocysteine metabolism in
Down syndrome and sought to determine whether the supplementation of
trisomy 21 lymphoblasts in vitro with selected nutrients would shift the
genetically induced metabolic imbalance. They found that the increased
activity of CBS in Down syndrome significantly alters homocysteine
metabolism so that the folate-dependent resynthesis of methionine is
compromised. The decreased availability of homocysteine promotes the
well-established 'folate trap,' creating a functional folate deficiency
that may contribute to the metabolic pathology of this complex genetic
disorder.

CBS domains were originally identified as sequence motifs of
approximately 60 amino acids that occur in cystathionine beta-synthase,
and several other proteins, in all organisms from archaea to humans
(Bateman, 1997). Their functional importance was emphasized by findings
that point mutations within them cause several hereditary diseases in
humans, including homocystinuria. Scott et al. (2004) showed that tandem
pairs of CBS domains from AMP-activated protein kinase, IMP
dehydrogenase-2 (IMPDH2; 146691), the chloride channel CLC2 (600570),
and cystathionine beta-synthase bind AMP, ATP, or S-adenosylmethionine,
whereas mutations that cause hereditary diseases impair this binding.
This showed that tandem pairs of CBS domains act, in most cases, as
sensors of cellular energy status and, as such, represent a class of
binding domain for adenosine derivatives.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Kraus (1994) tabulated 14 mutations in the CBS gene that he and his
colleagues had demonstrated in homocystinuria (236200). The G307S
mutation (613381.0001) is the most common cause of homocystinuria in
patients of Celtic origin. Kraus (1994) indicated that even though
patients have no measurable CBS activity in their fibroblasts and
despite the fact that CBS subunits are undetectable in fibroblast
extracts of some of these individuals, many of them are
pyridoxine-responsive. Examples were cited in which the identical
genotype resulted in a different phenotype within the family. In
general, G307S is a pyridoxine-nonresponsive mutation, whereas I278T
(613381.0004) is a pyridoxine-responsive mutation (Hu et al., 1993).

Sebastio et al. (1995) identified a 68-bp insertion in exon 8 of the CBS
gene (613381.0017) in a patient with homocystinuria and predicted that
it would introduce a premature termination codon and result in a
nonfunctional CBS enzyme. However, Tsai et al. (1996) found that this
mutation is highly prevalent. In a case-control study involving patients
with premature coronary artery disease, they identified the mutation in
heterozygosity in 11.7% of controls and in slightly higher prevalence in
the patients, although the difference did not reach statistical
significance. In all cases, the insertion was present in cis with the
833T-C (I278T) mutation. Tsai et al. (1996) suggested that the insertion
created an alternate splicing site that eliminated not only the inserted
intronic sequences, but also the 833T-C mutation associated with this
insertion. The net result was the generation of both quantitatively and
qualitatively normal mRNA and CBS enzyme.

Kraus et al. (1999) stated that 92 different disease-associated
mutations of the CBS gene had been identified in 310 examined
homocystinuric alleles in more than a dozen laboratories around the
world. Most of these mutations were missense, and the vast majority of
these were private mutations occurring in only 1 or a very small number
of families. The 2 most frequently encountered mutations were the
pyridoxine-responsive I278T (613381.0004) and the
pyridoxine-nonresponsive G307S (613381.0001). Mutations due to
deaminations of methylcytosines represented 53% of all point
substitutions in the coding region of the CBS gene.

Janosik et al. (2001) reported observations suggesting that inability to
bind heme may prevent correct folding and subsequent tetramer formation
of mutant and, to a lesser extent, normal CBS subunits. They postulated
that, as with other genetic defects (Bross et al., 1999), mutant CBS
misfolding and aggregation may be the primary defect in a significant
proportion of patients with homocystinuria.

In 6 patients from 5 Korean families with homocystinuria, Lee et al.
(2005) identified 8 different mutations in the CBS gene, including 4
novel mutations. In vitro functional expression studies showed that the
mutant enzymes had significantly decreased activities.

ANIMAL MODEL

Watanabe et al. (1995) generated mice that were moderately and severely
homocysteinemic, using homologous recombination in mouse embryonic stem
cells to inactivate the Cbs gene. Homozygous mutants completely lacking
cystathionine beta-synthase were born at the expected frequency from
matings of heterozygotes, but they suffered from severe growth
retardation and most of them died within 5 weeks after birth. Histologic
examination showed that the hepatocytes of homozygotes were enlarged,
multinucleated, and filled with microvesicular lipid droplets
(resembling the finding in some severe homocystinuric patients). Plasma
homocysteine levels of the homozygotes were approximately 40 times
normal. Heterozygous mutants had approximately 50% reduction in CBS mRNA
and enzyme activity in the liver and had twice normal plasma
homocysteine levels. Watanabe et al. (1995) concluded that homozygotes
are a useful model for the clinical disorder homocystinuria and the
heterozygotes should be useful for studying the role of elevated levels
of homocysteine in the causation of cardiovascular disease. They noted
that most of the homozygous mutant mice had eyes with delayed and narrow
eye openings but without obvious histologic abnormalities. Seemingly,
the homozygotes did not survive long enough to develop osteoporosis and
vascular occlusions.

Robert et al. (2003) found that Cbs-null mice fed a standard diet died
before 1 month of age. Chow enriched with choline chloride allowed
longer survival. Homocysteine was significantly increased in plasma and
liver of Cbs-null mice compared to controls. Gene expression measured by
Northern blot analysis showed altered expression of genes encoding
ribosomal protein S3a (RPS3A; 180478) and MTAP (156540), suggesting
changes in cellular growth and proliferation. In addition, many up- or
down-regulated genes indicated perturbations of the redox potential,
including cytochromes P450 (see, e.g., 107910), heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1;
141250), and PON1 (1568820), suggesting increased oxidative stress in
these animals.

Namekata et al. (2004) found that Cbs-null mice had abnormal lipid
metabolism, with markedly increased triglyceride and nonesterified fatty
acid levels in liver and serum. Thiolase activity was significantly
impaired and hepatic apolipoprotein B100 levels were decreased, whereas
serum apolipoprotein B100 and very low density lipoprotein levels were
increased. Other findings included decreased activity of LCAT (606967)
and altered serum cholesterol/triglyceride distribution in lipoprotein
fractions. These findings suggested impaired beta-oxidation of fatty
acids, and indicated that hepatic steatosis in Cbs-null mice is caused
by or associated with abnormal lipid metabolism.

Wang et al. (2005) engineered mice that expressed the common human
mutant I278T and I278T/T424N Cbs proteins. These transgene-containing
mice were then bred to Cbs +/- mice to generate Cbs -/- mice that
expressed only the I278T or I278T/T424N human transgenes. Both the I278T
and the I278T/T424N transgenes were able to entirely rescue the neonatal
mortality phenotype of Cbs -/- mice (see Watanabe et al., 1995) despite
these mice having a mean homocysteine level of 250 micromols. The
transgenic Cbs -/- animals exhibited facial alopecia, had moderate liver
steatosis, and were slightly smaller than heterozygous littermates. In
contrast to human CBS deficiency, these mice did not exhibit
hypermethioninemia. The mutant proteins were stable in several tissues,
although liver extracts had only 2 to 3% of the Cbs enzyme activity
found in wildtype mice. The I278T/T424N enzyme had exactly the same
activity as the I278T enzyme, indicating that T424N was unable to
suppress I278T in mice. Wang et al. (2005) concluded that elevated
homocysteine levels per se were not responsible for the neonatal
lethality observed in Cbs -/- animals and suggested that CBS protein may
have other functions in addition to its role in homocysteine catabolism.

Homocystinuria

In 2 unrelated patients with homocystinuria (236200), Gu et al. (1991)
found a G-to-A transition in the CBS gene, resulting in a gly307-to-ser
(G307S) substitution. Functional expression studies in E. coli showed a
peptide of normal mobility that lacked CBS activity.

Hu et al. (1993) found the G307S mutation in one allele of a patient of
French/Scottish ancestry and in both alleles of a patient of Irish
ancestry. Both parents of the second patient were heterozygotes for
G307S. The mutant protein was apparently stable in expression studies in
E. coli but lacked catalytic activity. Sequencing of exon 8 revealed the
G307S mutation in 5 additional families. All had
pyridoxine-nonresponsive homocystinuria.

Hu et al. (1993) observed this mutation in 9 of 52 apparently unrelated
alleles of varied ethnic backgrounds. All 9 were from patients with
Celtic (Irish/English/Scottish/French) ancestry in either one or both
parents. Indeed, the G307S mutation was detected in 9 of 18 Celtic
alleles in their series. A second mutation found in exon 8 (I278T;
613381.0004) was associated with pyridoxine responsiveness.

Gallagher et al. (1995) analyzed 17 Irish unrelated persons with
homocystinuria for the G307S mutation. Homozygosity for the mutation was
found in 8 of the 17. A further 8 patients were compound heterozygotes,
with the G307S mutation present on 1 allele. Of the 34 alleles, 24 (71%)
were G307S. Screening of newborns for homocystinuria has been routine in
Ireland since 1971. Newly diagnosed infants are also assessed for
responsiveness to pyridoxine; all patients analyzed by Gallagher et al.
(1995) were nonresponsive.

Kim et al. (1997) found a different distribution of CBS alleles in
Norwegian cystinurics. The G307S mutation, which was found in 71% of
mutant alleles in Ireland, accounted for only 20% in the Norwegian group
and in Italian patients was not observed at all (Sperandeo et al.,
1995).

Hyperhomocysteinemia, Thrombotic, CBS-related

In a patient with early-onset stroke and hyperhomocysteinemia without
other manifestations of classic homocystinuria (see 236200), Kelly et
al. (2003) identified a heterozygous G307S mutation. The patient was an
18-year-old Irish man with mitral valve prolapse who had an ischemic
stroke. A second CBS mutation was not identified.

HOMOCYSTINURIA, PYRIDOXINE-RESPONSIVE
CBS, PRO145LEU

In an adult female patient of Irish and German ancestry with relatively
mild and late-onset signs of homocystinuria (236200) responsive to
pyridoxine, Kozich et al. (1993) found compound heterozygosity for 2
different mutations of the CBS gene: a 434C-T transition resulting in a
pro145-to-leu (P145L) substitution, and a 341C-T transition resulting in
an ala114-to-val (A114V; 613381.0003) substitution.

Homocystinuria

On both alleles of a pyridoxine-responsive Polish patient with
homocystinuria, Hu et al. (1993) identified an 833T-C transition in exon
8 of the CBS gene, resulting in an ile278-to-thr (I278T) substitution.
They also identified this mutation on 1 allele of a
pyridoxine-nonresponsive Polish patient.

In a mildly affected pyridoxine-responsive patient of Ashkenazi Jewish
origin, Kozich and Kraus (1992) identified compound heterozygosity for a
maternal I278T mutation and a paternal IVS11-2A-C mutation
(613381.0012).

By PCR amplification and sequencing of exon 8 from genomic DNA, Shih et
al. (1995) detected the I278T mutation in 7 of 11 patients with in vivo
pyridoxine-responsiveness and in none of 27 pyridoxine-nonresponsive
patients; 2 pyridoxine-responsive patients were homozygous and 5 were
heterozygous for I278T. They further observed the I278T mutation in 9 of
22 (41%) independent alleles in pyridoxine-responsive patients of
various ethnic backgrounds. In 2 of the compound heterozygotes, they
identified novel mutations (G139R, 613381.0005 and E144K, 613381.0006)
on the other allele. The 2 patients who were homozygous for I278T had
only ectopia lentis and mild bone demineralization. Shih et al. (1995)
concluded that compound heterozygous patients who have one copy of the
I278T mutation are likely to retain some degree of pyridoxine
responsiveness.

Although the 833T-C mutation is found in 50% of the CBS alleles in Dutch
homozygous CBS-deficient patients, Kluijtmans et al. (1996) found it in
none of 60 patients with premature cardiovascular disease. This led them
to conclude that heterozygosity for CBS deficiency is not involved in
premature cardiovascular disease.

In a study of 21 unrelated Dutch pedigrees, Kluijtmans et al. (1999)
found that of 10 different mutations detected in the CBS gene, I278T was
predominant, being present in 23 (55%) of 42 independent alleles.
Homozygotes for this mutation tended to have higher homocysteine levels
than those in patients with other genotypes, but similar clinical
manifestations. I278T homozygotes responded more efficiently to
homocysteine-lowering treatment. After 378 patient-years of treatment,
only 2 vascular events were recorded; without treatment at least 30
would have been expected.

The I278T mutation is the most frequent mutation in homocystinuria in
Italy, where most cases are B6-responsive and the disorder has a total
frequency of approximately 1 in 55,000 as compared with a frequency of 1
in 58,000 in the United States and 1 in 889,000 in Japan (Sebastio,
1997).

Gaustadnes et al. (1999) stated that the I278T mutation is
geographically widespread. They determined the frequency of this
mutation among Danish newborns by screening 500 consecutive Guthrie
cards (specimens of infants' blood collected on filter paper). A
surprisingly high prevalence of the 833T-C mutation was detected among
newborns, suggesting that the incidence of homocystinuria due to
homozygosity for this mutation may be at least 1 per 20,500 live births
in Denmark.

In a study of 11 families in the state of Georgia (USA), Kruger et al.
(2003) found that the I278T and T353M (613381.0015) mutations accounted
for 45% of the mutant alleles. The T353M mutation, found exclusively in
4 African American patients, was associated with a B6-nonresponsive
phenotype and detection by neonatal screening for hypermethioninemia.
The I278T mutation was found exclusively in Caucasian patients and was
associated with a B6-responsive phenotype.

In a population-based study in Denmark, Skovby et al. (2010) concluded
that the predominant portion of individuals who are homozygous for the
I278T mutation may be clinically unaffected or may only be ascertained
after the third decade due to a thromboembolic event. These individuals
do not have most of the clinical features of complete CBS deficiency.

Hyperhomocysteinemia, Thrombotic, CBS-related

In a patient with early-onset stroke and hyperhomocysteinemia without
other classic features of homocystinuria (see 236200), Kelly et al.
(2003) identified a heterozygous I278T mutation. The patient was a
47-year-old white woman of northern European descent with a thrombus in
the right internal carotid artery. Kelly et al. (2003) postulated that
she might have another, unidentified CBS mutation.

HOMOCYSTINURIA, PYRIDOXINE-RESPONSIVE
CBS, LYS384GLU

In 2 unrelated French vitamin B6-responsive homocystinuria (236200)
patients with no Celtic origin, Aral et al. (1997) demonstrated novel
mutations in the CBS gene. One patient had unilateral lens subluxation
and deep vein thrombosis at age 6, and a Marfan-like appearance with
thinning of long bones and digits, together with osteoporosis of the
lower limbs. This patient was homozygous for a 1150A-G transition,
resulting in a substitution lys384-to-glu (K384E). See also 613381.0008.

HOMOCYSTINURIA, PYRIDOXINE-RESPONSIVE
CBS, LEU539SER

In a patient with pyridoxine-responsive homocystinuria (236200), Aral et
al. (1997) demonstrated homozygosity for a leu539-to-ser (L539S)
mutation in the CBS gene. See also 613381.0007.

.0009
HOMOCYSTINURIA, PYRIDOXINE-RESPONSIVE
CBS, ARG266LYS

Kim et al. (1997) found that 5 of 7 Norwegian patients classified as
having pyridoxine-responsive homocystinuria (236200) had a 797G-A
transition in the CBS gene, resulting in an arg266-to-lys (R266K)
substitution. Kim et al. (1997) tested the effect of all the mutations
identified on human CBS function utilizing a yeast system. Five of the 6
mutations had a distinguishable phenotype in yeast, indicating that they
were, in fact, pathogenic. The 797G-A had no phenotype when the yeast
were grown in high concentrations of pyridoxine, but a severe phenotype
when grown in low concentrations, thus mirroring the behavior in humans.
The yeast functional assay was suggested as a guide to therapy.

CBS, ASP444ASN

Homocystinuria

In a 20-year-old woman with pyridoxine-responsive homocystinuria
(236200), Kluijtmans et al. (1996) identified a homozygous 1330G-A
transition in the CBS gene, resulting in an asp444-to-asn (D444N)
substitution in the regulatory domain of the protein. She was first
admitted to the hospital at the age of 9 years because of psychomotor
retardation, marfanoid features with excessive height,
dolichostenomelia, arachnodactyly, and homocystinuria. She was treated
with pyridoxine, folic acid, and betaine, with favorable results. Eleven
years later she was in very good physical condition and her intellectual
development had reached an average level. Ectopia lentis, osteoporosis,
and vascular complications had not occurred. Both parents and an
unaffected sister were heterozygous for the mutation. Despite the
homozygous mutation, CBS activities in extracts of cultured fibroblasts
of this patient were not in the homozygous but in the heterozygous
range. In vitro functional expression studies showed no stimulation of
CBS activity by S-adenosylmethionine, contrary to a 3-fold stimulation
in control fibroblast extract. These data suggested that the D444N
mutation interfered with S-adenosylmethionine regulation of CBS.
Furthermore, it indicated the importance of S-adenosylmethionine
regulation of the transsulfuration pathway in homocysteine homeostasis
in humans.

CBS domains are defined as sequence motifs that occur in several
different proteins in all kingdoms of life. Their functional importance
is underlined by the finding that mutations in conserved residues within
them cause a variety of human hereditary diseases, including
homocystinuria. Scott et al. (2004) showed that tandem pairs of CBS
domains from cystathionine beta-synthase, as well as the CBS domains
from at least 3 other proteins that are the sites of mutations causing
hereditary diseases, bind AMP, ATP, or S-adenosylmethionine, whereas
mutations that cause hereditary diseases impair this binding. An
interesting feature of the pathogenic mutations in CBS domains is that
they tend to occur in equivalent positions. Thus, 3 mutations in the
PRKAG2 gene that cause disease--R302Q (602743.0001), H383R, and R531G
(602743.0006)--all align (plus or minus 1 residue) with the D444N
mutation in the CBS gene.

Hyperhomocysteinemia, Thrombotic, CBS-related

In a patient with early-onset stroke and hyperhomocysteinemia without
other manifestations of homocystinuria (see 236200), Kelly et al. (2003)
identified a heterozygous D444N mutation. The patient was a 39-year-old
Venezuelan man who had a retinal artery occlusion due to an arterial
dissection. An unaffected sister was also heterozygous for the mutation.
The presence of a second mutation could not be excluded.

.0011
HOMOCYSTINURIA, PYRIDOXINE-RESPONSIVE
CBS, VAL168MET

In a cell line from a patient with pyridoxine-responsive homocystinuria
(236200), Kruger and Cox (1995) identified a 502G-A transition in the
CBS gene, resulting in a val168-to-met (V168M) substitution in the
catalytic domain. Shan et al. (2001) identified 7 mutations that could
suppress the most common CBS patient mutation, I278T (613381.0004), 4 of
which mapped to the C-terminal regulatory domain. The suppressors, in
combination with the V168M mutation, also expressed a full-length
protein.

.0012
HOMOCYSTINURIA, PYRIDOXINE-RESPONSIVE
CBS, IVS11AS, A-C, -2

In a mildly affected patient of Ashkenazi Jewish origin with
pyridoxine-responsive homocystinuria (236200), Kozich and Kraus (1992)
identified compound heterozygosity for a maternal I278T mutation
(613381.0004) and a paternal A-to-C transversion in the intron 11 splice
acceptor. The latter mutation led to an in-frame deletion of exon 12.

.0013
HYPERHOMOCYSTEINEMIA, THROMBOTIC, CBS-RELATED
CBS, PRO422LEU

In a group of unrelated patients that were screened for elevated
homocysteine after an idiopathic thrombotic event (see 236200),
Gaustadnes et al. (2000) found that 1 was compound heterozygous for 2
mutations in the CBS gene: a pro422-to-leu substitution in the
C-terminal regulatory domain, and an asp444-to-asn mutation
(613381.0010). The diagnosis of elevated homocysteine had been made
after an episodic transient ischemic attack at the age of 22 years. The
patient was found to be nonresponsive to therapy with either pyridoxine
or betaine. The patient did not carry the 677C-T transition in the MTHFR
gene (607093.0003). The usual manifestations of classic homocystinuria
such as ectopia lentis, marfanoid skeletal features, and mental
retardation were lacking. In vitro functional expression studies showed
that the P422L mutant protein was catalytically active and even had
higher activity than wildtype, but was impaired in regulation by AdoMet.

.0014
HYPERHOMOCYSTEINEMIA, THROMBOTIC, CBS-RELATED
CBS, SER466LEU

In a 39-year-old woman with high homocysteine levels when screened after
an episodic transient ischemic attack at the age of 36 years (see
236200) (Gaustadnes et al., 2000), Maclean et al. (2002) found compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the CBS gene: I278T (613381.0004) and
a 139C-T transition, resulting in a ser466-to-leu (S466L) substitution
in the C-terminal regulatory domain. The patient had no ectopia lentis,
mental retardation, marfanoid skeletal features, or other characteristic
features of classic homocystinuria (236200). In vitro functional
expression studies showed that the S466L mutant protein was
catalytically active and even had higher activity than wildtype, but was
impaired in regulation by AdoMet.

In mice, Gupta et al. (2008) demonstrated that the S466L mutation causes
homocystinuria by affecting both the steady state level of CBS and by
reducing the efficiency of the enzyme. In the presence of zinc, the mean
serum total homocysteine of transgenic S466L mice was 142(+/-55) microM
compared to 16(+/-13) microM for wildtype. Transgenic mice also had
significantly higher levels of total free homocysteine and
S-adenosylhomocysteine in liver and kidney. Only 48% of S466L mice had
detectable CBS protein in the liver, whereas all the wildtype animals
had detectable protein. However, CBS mRNA was significantly elevated in
transgenic mice, suggesting that the reduction in mutant protein
resulted from posttranscriptional mechanisms. The mutant enzyme formed
tetramers and was active, but lacked inducibility by
S-adenosylmethionine.

.0015
HOMOCYSTINURIA, PYRIDOXINE-NONRESPONSIVE
CBS, THR353MET

In the state of Georgia (USA), Kruger et al. (2003) studied 11 families
with CBS deficiency (236200). A thr353-to-met (T353M) mutation, found
exclusively in 4 African American patients, was associated with a
B6-nonresponsive phenotype and with detection by newborn screening for
hypermethioninemia. The I278T (613381.0004) and T353M mutations
accounted for 45% of the mutant alleles in the affected members of the
11 families. The I278T mutation was found exclusively in Caucasian
patients and was associated with a B6-responsive phenotype.

.0016
HOMOCYSTINURIA, PYRIDOXINE-NONRESPONSIVE
CBS, THR191MET

Among 35 patients from 30 pedigrees with homocystinuria (236200) from
the Iberian peninsula and several South American countries, Urreizti et
al. (2006) found a high frequency of a 572C-T transition in the CBS
gene, resulting in a thr191-to-met (T191M) substitution. The patients
were from Spain, Portugal, Colombia, and Argentina. Combined with
previously reported studies, the prevalence of T191M among mutant CBS
alleles in different countries was 0.75 in Colombia, 0.52 in Spain, 0.33
in Portugal, 0.25 in Venezuela, 0.20 in Argentina, and 0.14 in Brazil.
Haplotype analysis suggested a double origin for this mutation. The
phenotype was B6-nonresponsive.

.0017
CYSTATHIONINE BETA-SYNTHETASE POLYMORPHISM
CBS, 68-BP INS

Sebastio et al. (1995) identified a 68-bp insertion in exon 8 of the CBS
gene in a patient with homocystinuria and predicted that it would
introduce a premature termination codon and result in a nonfunctional
CBS enzyme. However, Tsai et al. (1996) found that this mutation is
highly prevalent. In a case-control study involving patients with
premature coronary artery disease, they identified the mutation in
heterozygosity in 11.7% of controls and in slightly higher prevalence in
the patients, although the difference did not reach statistical
significance. In all cases, the insertion was present in cis with the
833T-C (I278T; 613381.0004) mutation. Tsai et al. (1996) suggested that
the insertion created an alternate splicing site that eliminated not
only the inserted intronic sequences, but also the 833T-C mutation
associated with this insertion. The net result was the generation of
both quantitatively and qualitatively normal mRNA and CBS enzyme.

Sperandeo et al. (1996) also identified the 68-bp insertion as a benign
polymorphism in an Italian cohort.

Kim et al. (1997) studied the mutations in 10 Norwegian CBS-deficient
families and identified 18 of the 20 mutant alleles. In 9 of the 20 CBS
alleles (45%), they found the 68-bp duplication allele. This frequency
was much higher than the 6% reported by Tsai et al. (1996) in a study
population from the upper midwest of the US. In unaffected Norwegian
chromosomes, Kim et al. (1997) found the frequency of the duplication to
be approximately 5.5% (2 in 36).

Franco et al. (1998), who referred to the 68-bp insertion in the coding
region of exon 8 of the CBS gene as 844ins68, investigated its
prevalence in 405 persons belonging to 4 different ethnic groups. The
insertion was found in heterozygous state in 14 of 104 whites (13.5%),
was absent among Asians, and was found in only 1 of 220 Amerindian
chromosomes analyzed, whereas a much higher prevalence was observed
among blacks (37.7% of heterozygotes and 4% of mutant homozygotes). In
all carriers of the insertion, the 833T-C CBS mutation cosegregated in
cis with 844ins68. The finding of the double mutant among blacks and
Caucasians suggested that it antedated the divergence between Africans
and non-Africans, and provided evidence for a partly or completely
neutralizing effect conferred by the 68-bp insertion, since it allows
the skipping of the 833T-C mutation.

605515	TITLE *605515 FORKHEAD BOX P1; FOXP1
;;GLUTAMINE-RICH FACTOR 1; QRF1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

FOXP1 is a transcriptional repressor that plays a critical role in
monocyte differentiation and macrophage function (Shi et al., 2008).

CLONING

Li and Tucker (1993) cloned a glutamine-rich factor, which they
designated QRF1, that was expressed preferentially at the terminal
differentiation stage of B cells and in skeletal muscle. The deduced
707-amino acid QRF1 protein contains an 84-amino acid segment that shows
significant sequence homology with the DNA-binding domains of the
hepatocyte nuclear factor-3/forkhead (see FOXA1; 602294) family of
proteins.

By expression cloning using blood and testis cDNA libraries to identify
the target of a monoclonal antibody (JC12), Banham et al. (2001)
obtained a full-length cDNA encoding FOXP1. The predicted 677-amino acid
protein contains coiled-coil, glutamine-rich, and serine/threonine-rich
domains in its N-terminal half; a central zinc finger domain; and
coiled-coil, serine/threonine/proline-rich, winged helix, and acidic
domains in its C-terminal half. FOXP1 also has numerous putative
phosphorylation sites, 2 nuclear localization signals (NLSs) in its
C-terminal half, and 2 PEST motif in its C-terminal acidic region.
Multiple-tissue array analysis showed ubiquitous expression of FOXP1 in
normal adult and fetal tissues, with highest expression in lymphoid and
gastrointestinal tissues. Immunohistochemistry showed that FOXP1 protein
was widely expressed, with a predominantly nuclear localization, in
normal tissues.

Wang et al. (2003) stated that there are 4 splice variants of mouse
Foxp1, designated Foxp1a through Foxp1d. They identified and cloned
Foxp1d, which encodes a Foxp1 isoform lacking the N-terminal
polyglutamine domain found in Foxp1a and Foxp1b. Northern blot analysis
and RNase protection assays showed tissue-specific expression of all 4
variants in mouse. Northern blot analysis of human tissues detected
tissue-specific expression of FOXP1 variants, with highest levels in
peripheral blood lymphocytes and in caudate nucleus of brain. Western
blot analysis detected variable expression of Foxp1a, Foxp1c, and Foxp1d
in mouse tissues, with high expression of all 3 isoforms in lung.

GENE FUNCTION

Wang et al. (2003) found that mouse Foxp1a, Foxp1c, Foxp1d, and the
related Foxp2 (605317) protein bound a 7-nucleotide core sequence,
TATTT(G/A)T. These Foxp proteins repressed gene transcription via
binding to this consensus site, which was identified within the SV40 and
IL2 (147680) promoters. In some cases, the strength of Foxp1 repression
was mediated by the polyglutamine domain. Mouse Foxp1 proteins also
formed homodimers or heterodimers with subfamily members, and the
conserved C2H2 zinc finger and leucine zipper motifs mediated
dimerization.

Using genetic manipulations, Rousso et al. (2008) demonstrated that
Foxp1 established the pattern of LIM-homeodomain protein (see 601999)
expression in embryonic mice and, accordingly, organized motor axon
projections, their connectivity with peripheral targets, and the
establishment of motor pools. Hox proteins (see 142950) dictated the
pattern of Foxp1 expression in spinal cord, and both Foxp1 and Hox were
required for segment-appropriate generation of motor columns and pools
in mouse.

Shi et al. (2008) generated transgenic mice overexpressing human FOXP1
in monocyte/macrophage lineage cells. Circulating blood monocytes from
these mice had reduced expression of macrophage colony-stimulating
factor receptor (CSF1R; 164770), impaired migratory capacity, and
diminished accumulation as splenic macrophages. Macrophage functions
were globally impaired, and osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption were
attenuated. Forced overexpression of Csf1r reversed many of the
deficits, suggesting that repression of Csf1r is likely the dominant
mechanism responsible for FOXP1 effects on monocyte differentiation and
macrophage function.

- Association of FOXP1 With Cancer

By analysis of a tumor/normal tissue expression array, Banham et al.
(2001) found that expression of FOXP1 was lower in colon tumors and
higher in stomach and prostate tumors compared with matched normal
tissues. Immunohistochemical analysis showed frequent loss of
expression, increased expression, and cytoplasmic mislocalization of the
predominantly nuclear FOXP1 protein in solid tumors.

By immunohistochemical analysis of a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (BCL)
tissue microarray, Banham et al. (2005) found that untreated patients
with a high percentage of FOXP1-positive nuclei had significantly
reduced survival and earlier progression compared with FOXP1-negative
patients.

Of 275 BCLs, Haralambieva et al. (2005) found that only 5 (3
gastrointestinal, 1 thyroid, and 1 cervical lymph node) carried a
chromosomal breakpoint in the FOXP1 gene and strong nuclear FOXP1
expression. All were diffuse large BCLs rather than marginal zone BCLs.
Haralambieva et al. (2005) concluded that genetic alterations at 3p13
are associated with strong FOXP1 expression.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Banham et al. (2001) mapped the FOXP1 gene
to chromosome 3p14.1.

CYTOGENETICS

Streubel et al. (2005) noted that 3 chromosomal translocations,
t(11;18)(q21;q21), t(14;18)(q32;q21), and t(1;14)(p22;q32), are
associated with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas. They
identified a t(3;14)(p14;q32) in a case of MALT lymphoma of the thyroid.
FISH studies showed that the IGH locus (147100) was rearranged, and
long-distance inverse PCR identified FOXP1 as the partner gene on
chromosome 3. Using FISH assays to screen 91 MALT lymphomas negative for
3 common translocations, Streubel et al. (2005) identified
t(3;14)(p14;q32) in 9 cases (3 thyroid, 4 ocular adnexa, and 2 skin).
Most t(3;14)(p14;q32)-positive MALT lymphomas also harbored additional
genetic abnormalities, such as trisomy 3. All 4 of the MALT-associated
translocations were mutually exclusive. Real-time RT-PCR analysis showed
upregulated expression of FOXP1 in MALT cases with t(3;14)(p14;q32) or
trisomy 3. Streubel et al. (2005) concluded that FOXP1 is a
translocation partner of IGH in a site-dependent subset of MALT
lymphomas.

Carr et al. (2010) reported a boy with severe speech delay and delayed
motor development (see 613670) who carried a de novo heterozygous 1.0-Mb
interstitial deletion of chromosome 3p14.1 that involved only the FOXP1
gene. The phenotype was confounded by a Chiari I malformation, which was
surgically corrected at age 30 months. The patient had delayed gross
motor skills and walked at 16 months. After surgery for the Chiari
malformation, he had some improvement in motor skills. The most
significant feature was speech delay with limited verbal output and
difficulty in articulating entire words and multisyllabic speech,
although he did not have a deficit in oromotor coordination. At age 4
years, he developed staring spells with motor arrest associated with
epileptiform discharges. He had mild dysmorphic facial features,
including broad forehead, hypertelorism, downslanting palpebral
fissures, ptosis, short nose, broad nasal tip, and smooth philtrum. Carr
et al. (2010) concluded that FOXP1 may play a role in the development of
verbal and motor skills.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Hamdan et al. (2010) identified 2 different de novo heterozygous
mutations in the FOXP1 gene (605515.0001 and 605515.0002, respectively)
in 2 unrelated children of French Canadian origin with moderate mental
retardation, expressive language deficits, and autistic features
(613670). The first mutation (605515.0001) was a small deletion found
using array-based comparative genomic hybridization of a cohort of 80
patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and 30 with intellectual
disability. The second mutation (R525X; 605515.0002) was found by direct
sequencing of the FOXP1 gene in a cohort of 110 patients with
intellectual disability, 84 with ASD, and 51 with both. Hamdan et al.
(2010) chose to examine the FOXP1 gene specifically because of the role
of the FOXP2 gene (605317) in a speech and language disorder (SPCH1;
602081); patients with intellectual disability and ASD often show
language impairment. The results indicated that disruption of FOXP1 has
a global impact on brain development.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hu et al. (2006) found that mice lacking Foxp1 died at embryonic day
14.5 due to heart valve and outflow tract abnormalities. Reconstitution
of Rag2 (179616)-deficient mice with Foxp1 -/- or Foxp1 +/- fetal liver
cells resulted in decreased mature B cells, but normal thymocytes, in
the recipients. Foxp1 -/- pro-B cells had reduced IgM, Rag1 (179615),
and Rag2 expression, and V(D)J rearrangement was also impaired in Foxp1
-/- B cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and EMSA analyses showed that
Foxp1 bound to Foxp site-2 (Fkh2) in the Erag enhancer, which is
upstream of Rag2, in a B-lineage specific way. Hu et al. (2006)
concluded that FOXP1 influences B-cell development at an early stage,
and that FOXP1 deficiency results in a phenotype that resembles double
haploinsufficiency of E2A (TCF3; 147141) and EBF (164343).

Feng et al. (2010) generated mice with a conditional deletion of Foxp1
in double-positive thymocytes and found that peripheral Cd4 (see 186940)
and Cd8 (see 186910) cells also lacked Foxp1 and that single-positive
thymocytes acquired an activated phenotype in thymus. Peripheral cells
also exhibited an activated phenotype and increased apoptosis and
readily produced cytokines upon T-cell receptor engagement. Feng et al.
(2010) concluded that FOXP1 is an essential transcriptional regulator
for thymocyte development and the generation of quiescent naive T cells.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MENTAL RETARDATION WITH LANGUAGE IMPAIRMENT AND AUTISTIC FEATURES
FOXP1, 390-KB DEL

In a French Canadian girl who had mental retardation with language
impairment and autistic features (613670), Hamdan et al. (2010)
identified a de novo heterozygous 390-kb intragenic deletion in the
FOXP1 gene. The deletion encompassed exons 4 to 14 of the longest FOXP1
isoform, including the translation initiation site and leucine zipper
and zinc finger domains important for transcriptional activity.

.0002
MENTAL RETARDATION WITH LANGUAGE IMPAIRMENT AND AUTISTIC FEATURES
FOXP1, ARG525TER

In a French Canadian boy who had mental retardation with language
impairment and autistic features (613670), Hamdan et al. (2010)
identified a de novo heterozygous 1573C-T transition in the FOXP1 gene,
resulting in an arg525-to-ter (R525X) substitution. The mutation was
predicted to abolish the last 152 residues of the protein, including
part of the forkhead DNA-binding (FHD) domain and a conserved nuclear
localization signal. The mutation was not found in 570 controls. In
vitro functional expression studies in HEK293 cells showed that the
R525X mutant impaired the transcriptional repression ability of FOXP1,
consistent with a loss of function.

604188	TITLE *604188 SELENIUM-BINDING PROTEIN 1; SELENBP1
;;SELENIUM-BINDING PROTEIN, 56-KD; SP56
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Selenium is an essential nutrient that exhibits potent anticarcinogenic
properties, and deficiency of selenium may cause certain neurologic
diseases. It has been proposed that the effects of selenium in
preventing cancer and neurologic diseases may be mediated by
selenium-binding proteins. By sequencing randomly selected human fetal
heart cDNAs, followed by searching sequence databases for sequence
similarities, Chang et al. (1997) identified a cDNA that has sequence
similarity to the mouse 56-kD selenium-binding protein (Sp56) gene. The
deduced 472-amino acid human SP56 (SELENBP1) has 87.3% and 86.4% amino
acid identity to mouse Sp56 and the acetaminophen metabolite-binding
protein AP56, respectively. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues
detected the highest Sp56 expression in liver, kidney, and lung (see
also Lanfear et al., 1993).

GENE FUNCTION

Okunuki et al. (2007) identified selenium-binding protein as a candidate
retinal autoantigen in patients with Behcet disease (109650). Because
anti-SELENBP1 antibody-positive patients showed more frequent ocular
inflammation than the antibody-negative patient group, Okunuki et al.
(2007) concluded that autoimmunity against this retinal antigen might
contribute to the pathogenesis of uveitis in BD patients.

MAPPING

By FISH, Chang et al. (1997) mapped the SELENBP1 gene to 1q21-q22.

605449	TITLE *605449 GLUTATHIONE S-TRANSFERASE, ALPHA-3; GSTA3
;;GLUTATHIONE S-TRANSFERASE A3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The glutathione S-transferases (GST; EC 2.5.1.18) catalyze the
conjugation of reduced glutathiones and a variety of electrophiles,
including many known carcinogens and mutagens. The cytosolic GSTs belong
to a large superfamily. For additional information on GSTs, see GSTA1
(138359).

CLONING

Suzuki et al. (1993) identified a DNA sequence showing similarity to the
sequence of the alpha subclass of GSTs, GSTA1 (138359) and GSTA2
(138360). Using this sequence, Board (1998) identified a partial cDNA
clone of GSTA3 from an 8- to 9-week placenta cDNA library, suggesting
that the GSTA3 gene is functional and developmentally regulated.

By searching a genomic sequence database with the GSTA1 and GSTA4
(605450) sequences, Morel et al. (2002) identified 1 BAC and 3 PAC
clones covering more than 400 kb and containing the entire GST-alpha
gene cluster. The cluster consists of 5 genes, GSTA1, GSTA2, GSTA3,
GSTA4, and GSTA5 (607605), as well as 7 pseudogenes. The deduced GSTA3
protein contains 222 amino acids. By RT-PCR using gene-specific probes,
Morel et al. (2002) demonstrated that GSTA1, GSTA2, and GSTA4
transcripts are widely expressed in human tissues, whereas the GSTA3
transcript appears to be a rare message subject to splicing defects.
Although GSTA5 appears to be a functional gene, expression of GSTA5
could not be detected in any tissues examined.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Morel et al. (2002) determined that the
GSTA3 gene contains 7 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Morel et al. (2002) mapped the GSTA3 gene
to the GST-alpha gene cluster on chromosome 6p12.

they called polyserase-2. The deduced 855-amino acid protein has a
predicted molecular mass of 93 kD and contains 9 potential
N-glycosylation sites. PRSS36 contains a signal peptide, followed by a
propeptide domain, an active serine protease domain with the catalytic
his, asp, and ser residues, and 2 serine protease domains predicted to
be catalytically inactive. The first serine protease domain shares amino
acid identity of 40 to 42% with gamma-1 tryptase (TPSG1; 609341),
pancreasin (608018), matriptase (ST14; 606797), matriptase-2 (TMPRSS6;
609862), and polyserase-1 (TMPRSS9). Northern blot analysis detected a
5-kb transcript in fetal kidney and adult skeletal muscle, liver,
placenta, and heart. A 2.2-kb transcript was detected in placenta,
prostate, and colon and lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, and may be
produced by alternative splicing. Immunolocalization studies and Western
blot analysis indicated that PRSS36 is secreted as a glycosylated
protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Cal et al. (2005) showed that purified recombinant PRSS36 constructs
lacking the prodomain hydrolyzed a variety of synthetic serine protease
substrates and that serine protease inhibitors inhibited these
activities. Activity of the first serine protease domain was higher than
that of the entire PRSS36 polyprotein.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Cal et al. (2005) mapped the PRSS36 gene
to chromosome 16p11.2.

DNA POLYMERASE, DELTA 4, SMALLEST SUBUNIT; POLDS;;
P12
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The DNA polymerase delta complex is involved in DNA replication and
repair, and it consists of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA;
176740), the multisubunit replication factor C (see 102579), and the 4
subunit polymerase complex: POLD1 (174761), POLD2 (600815), POLD3
(611415), and POLD4 (Liu and Warbrick, 2006).

CLONING

By EST database analysis using calf Pold4 and S. pombe Cdm1 sequences,
Liu et al. (2000) identified POLD4, which they called p12. The deduced
107-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 12.4 kD and
shares 25% amino acid identity with S. pombe Cdm1, the fourth subunit of
S. pombe polymerase delta.

GENE FUNCTION

Liu and Warbrick (2006) showed that both the p12 and p66 (POLD3; 611415)
subunits can be modified by ubiquitin in predominantly monoubiquitinated
forms. Using lysine to arginine substitution mutants, they showed that
ubiquitination took place on some combination of lysine residues and not
at the free N terminus. They suggested that p12 ubiquitination may play
a role in regulating protein-protein interactions.

Zhang et al. (2007) showed that rapid degradation of p12 occurred in
response to UV or genotoxic treatment of HeLa and HEK293T cells. The
half-life of p12 was reduced approximately 30-fold after UV treatment,
from 11 hours to 24 minutes, and p12 depletion was due to an accelerated
rate of proteolysis that required proteasome activity and an active
ubiquitin pathway. UV treatment converted the DNA polymerase delta
complex in vivo to a 3-subunit enzyme lacking p12 that retained activity
on poly(dA)/oligo(dT) templates but was impaired in its ability to
extend singly primed M13 templates, suggesting that the loss of the p12
subunit compromised POLD activity. Zhang et al. (2007) found that p12
degradation was blocked in ATR (601215) -/- cells but not in ATM
(607585) -/- cells and concluded that p12 degradation is regulated by
ATR, the apical kinase that regulates the damage response in S-phase.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the POLD4
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP WI-18546).

;;DIA1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In a large Costa Rican kindred with autosomal dominant, fully penetrant,
nonsyndromic sensorineural progressive low-frequency hearing loss
(DFNA1; 124900), Lynch et al. (1997) mapped the disease gene to a region
on chromosome 5q31 by linkage analysis. They constructed a complete
800-kb bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) contig of the linked region
and identified DIAPH1, a human gene homologous to the Drosophila gene
'diaphanous.' This human homolog of diaphanous has approximately 3,800
bp of coding sequence and a 3-prime untranslated region (UTR) of 918 or
1,891 bp. Lynch et al. (1997) found that the human gene is expressed in
brain, heart, placenta, lung, kidney, pancreas, liver, and skeletal
muscle. A single transcript of 4.7 kb was observed in all tissues, with
highest expression in skeletal muscle. They confirmed expression of the
diaphanous homolog in the cochlea by RT-PCR of cochlear RNA. In the
course of cloning the DIAPH1 gene, Lynch et al. (1997) identified a
second human homolog of the Drosophila diaphanous gene, DIAPH2 (300108),
which maps to Xq22.

GENE FUNCTION

Actin polymerization involves proteins known to interact with diaphanous
protein in Drosophila and mouse. Lynch et al. (1997) speculated that the
biologic role of DIAPH1 in hearing is likely to be the regulation of
actin polymerization in hair cells of the inner ear. Given that human
DIAPH1 appears to be ubiquitously expressed, and that the only observed
phenotype in the Costa Rican family with a DIAPH1 mutation (see
MOLECULAR GENETICS) is hearing loss, it seemed likely to Lynch et al.
(1997) that the hair cells of the cochlea are particularly sensitive to
proper maintenance of the actin cytoskeleton.

Geneste et al. (2002) found that LIM domain kinase-1 (LIMK1; 601329) and
diaphanous cooperated to regulate serum response factor (SRF; 600589)
and actin dynamics in a rat neural precursor cell line.

Using human melanocytes and melanoma cell lines, Carreira et al. (2006)
identified MITF (156845) as a regulator of DIAPH1. Since DIAPH1 also
regulates SKP2 (601436), an F-box protein that promotes degradation of
p27(Kip1) (CDKN1B; 600778), depletion of MITF led to downregulation of
DIAPH1, followed by p27(Kip1)-dependent G1 arrest, reorganization of the
actin cytoskeleton, and increased cellular invasiveness. In contrast,
increased MITF expression promoted proliferation. Carreira et al. (2006)
concluded that variations in environmental cues that determine MITF
activity dictate the differentiation, proliferative, and
invasive/migratory potential of melanoma cells.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Rose et al. (2005) presented the crystal structure of RhoC (165380) in
complex with the regulatory N terminus of mouse Diaph1 containing the
GBD/FH3 region, an all-helical structure with armadillo repeats. Rho
uses its 'switch' regions for interacting with 2 subdomains of GBD/FH3.
Rose et al. (2005) showed that the FH3 domain of Diaph1 forms a stable
dimer and identified the diaphanous autoregulatory domain (DAD)-binding
site. Although binding of Rho and DAD on the N-terminal fragment of
Diaph1 are mutually exclusive, their binding sites are only partially
overlapping.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lynch et al. (1997) determined that the DIAPH1 gene contains at least 18
exons.

MAPPING

By BAC analysis, Lynch et al. (1997) mapped the DIAPH1 gene to
chromosome 5q31.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a large Costa Rican kindred with DFNA1, Lynch et al. (1997)
identified a splice donor mutation in the penultimate exon of the DIAPH1
gene (602121.0001).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
DEAFNESS, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT 1
DIAPH1, IVS17DS, G-T, +1

In members of a large kindred of Costa Rica affected with DFNA1
(124900), Lynch et al. (1997) demonstrated a guanine-to-thymine
transversion in the splice donor of the penultimate exon of the human
diaphanous homolog on chromosome 5q31. The substitution disrupted the
canonical splice donor sequence AAGgtaagt and resulted in insertion of 4
nucleotides in the gene transcript of affected individuals. The
mechanism for the insertion was splicing at a cryptic site 4 bp 3-prime
of the wildtype site. The insertion leads to a frameshift, encoding 21
aberrant amino acids, followed by protein termination that truncated 32
amino acids from the mature protein. The sequence of the RT-PCR product
from cochlear RNA was wildtype. Hence, if alternate splice forms of the
gene exist, normal cochlear transcripts include the region of the gene
that is improperly spliced in affected members of the kindred. Lynch et
al. (1997) noted that the DFNA1 mutation in the Costa Rican family is
relatively subtle, in that it affects only the C-terminal 52 amino acids
of a protein that must have more than 1,200 amino acid residues. The
mutation may represent a partial loss of function of the gene.
