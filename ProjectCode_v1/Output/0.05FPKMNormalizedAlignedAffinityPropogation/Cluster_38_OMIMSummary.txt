612210	TITLE *612210 HIGHLY UPREGULATED IN LIVER CANCER; HULC
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; 114550)-specific cDNA microarray
platform, Panzitt et al. (2007) identified HULC, a novel mRNA-like
noncoding RNA (ncRNA). Northern blot analysis detected a transcript of
about 500 nucleotides predominantly in HCC patient tissue. HULC RNA
localized to the cytoplasm and copurified with ribosomes. The transcript
did not appear to be translated. Panzitt et al. (2007) identified HULC
orthologs in several primate species, but not in mouse or rat.

GENE FUNCTION

Using quantitative RT-PCR, Panzitt et al. (2007) detected markedly
elevated HULC RNA in HCC liver tissue and in 3 of 4 blood samples from
HCC patients. HULC was also upregulated, but to a lesser extent, in
nonneoplastic focal nodular hyperplasias and in cirrhotic liver tissue
compared with normal tissue. Knockdown of HULC in 2 human HCC cell lines
resulted in the altered expression of numerous genes, suggesting that
HULC may be a noncoding regulatory RNA. Panzitt et al. (2007) found no
significant homology between HULC and its putative target sequences,
suggesting that any regulatory role may be indirect.

GENE STRUCTURE

Panzitt et al. (2007) determined that the HULC gene contains 2 exons,
both of which have a high CpG content. Exon 1 consists mainly of a long
terminal repeat, suggesting integration of a retrotransposon.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Panzitt et al. (2007) mapped the HULC gene
to chromosome 6p24.3.

614386	TITLE *614386 PROLINE-RICH TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN 2; PRRT2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chen et al. (2011) identified PRRT2 within a region of chromosome 16
linked to the paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia locus (EKD1; 128200).
The deduced 340-amino acid protein has a proline-rich domain in its
N-terminal half and 2 transmembrane domains in its C-terminal half.
RT-PCR of mouse tissues detected high Prrt2 expression in brain and
spinal cord, with negligible expression in all other tissues examined.
Prrt2 expression in mouse was low prior to embryonic day 16, after which
it increased, peaked at postnatal day 14, and declined in adult. RT-PCR
and in situ hybridization of postnatal day-14 mouse brain revealed high
Prrt2 expression in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum, with
enrichment in cortical layers of cerebral cortex, as well as in granule
cells and Purkinje cell layers of cerebellum. Fluorescence-tagged PRRT2
was expressed in the membrane of transfected COS-7 cells.

Heron et al. (2012) found that Prrt2 was widely expressed in the mouse
brain, with high expression in the cerebral cortex and lower expression
in the basal ganglia.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chen et al. (2011) determined that the PRRT2 gene contains 4 exons, the
first of which is noncoding.

MAPPING

Chen et al. (2011) stated that the PRRT2 gene maps to chromosome
16p11.2.

GENE FUNCTION

In HEK293T cells and brain extracts from mice, Lee et al. (2012)
demonstrated that the PRRT2 protein interacted with SNAP25 (600322), a
synaptosomal membrane. After transfection of PRRT2 into rat hippocampal
cells, PRRT2 was detected in thin axonal processes exiting from the
neuron cell bodies.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 8 unrelated Han Chinese families with episodic
kinesigenic dyskinesia-1 (EKD1; 128200), Chen et al. (2011) identified 3
different heterozygous truncating mutations in the PRRT2 gene
(614386.0001-614386.0003). The first mutation was found by exome
sequencing of a large 4-generation family with 17 affected individuals.
Expression of a truncated form of PRRT2 in COS-7 cells showed loss of
membrane targeting and localization of the truncated protein in the
cytoplasm, suggesting interruption of protein function.

Using a combination of exome sequencing and linkage analysis in 2 large
Han Chinese families with EKD1, Wang et al. (2011) independently and
simultaneously identified 2 different heterozygous truncating mutations
in the PRRT2 gene (649dupC, 614386.0001 and Q163X, 614386.0009,
respectively) that completely segregated with the phenotype in each
family. Two patients in each family also had infantile convulsion and
choreoathetosis syndrome (ICCA; 602066). Analysis of 3 additional Han
Chinese families with EKD1 revealed that 2 carried the 649dupC mutation
and 1 had a different PRRT2 mutation (614386.0010).

Heron et al. (2012) identified heterozygous mutations in the PRRT2 gene
(see, e.g., 614386.0001 and 614386.0004-614386.0006) in 14 (82%) of 17
families with benign familial infantile seizures-2 (BFIS2; 605751), and
in 5 (83%) of 6 families with familial infantile convulsions with
paroxysmal choreoathetosis, a familial syndrome in which infantile
seizures and an adolescent-onset movement disorder, paroxysmal
kinesigenic choreoathetosis (EKD1), cooccur. The 649dupC mutation
(614386.0001) was the most common mutation, found in affected members of
12 families with BFIS2 and in 3 families with ICCA. Overall, the 649dupC
mutation was found in 15 (79%) of the 19 families with ICCA or BFIS2
studied. The families were of different ethnic origin, including
Australasian of western European heritage, Swedish, and Israeli
Sephardic-Jewish, and there was no evidence of a common haplotype among
these families, indicating a mutation hotspot. These findings
demonstrated that mutations in PRRT2 cause both epilepsy and a movement
disorder, with obvious pleiotropy in age of expression.

Lee et al. (2012) also identified heterozygous mutations in the PRRT2
gene (see, e.g., 614386.0007 and 614386.0008) in affected members of
families with ICCA. The mutations were identified by whole-genome
sequencing of 6 well-characterized families. The findings were confirmed
by the identification of PRRT2 mutations in 24 of 25 additional families
with the disorder. The 649dupC mutation was the most common mutation.
Sanger sequencing of a third cohort of 78 probands with a less clear
clinical diagnosis found that 10 patients with familial disease and 17
with sporadic disease had the common 649dupC mutation; 1 additional
patient had a different truncating PRRT2 mutation. None of the
pathogenic alleles were found in over 2,500 control chromosomes. There
was intrafamilial variability of the phenotype. In vitro functional
expression assays showed that the mutant truncating proteins were not
expressed and did not exert dominant-negative effect on the wildtype
protein, suggesting haploinsufficiency as the pathologic mechanism.

Meneret et al. (2012) identified heterozygous mutations in the PRRT2
gene (see, e.g., 614386.0001; 614386.0011-614386.0012) in 22 (65%) of 34
patients of European descent with EKD1 or ICCA. Mutations were found in
13 (93%) of 14 familial cases and in 9 (45%) of 20 sporadic cases. There
was evidence for incomplete penetrance. The most common mutation was
649dupC, which was found in 17 of the 22 patients with PRRT2 mutations,
although this was not due to a founder effect. Compared to patients
without PRRT2 mutations, those with mutations had a slightly earlier age
at onset (median age of 15 years and 9 years, respectively), but
otherwise there were no phenotypic differences between the 2 groups.
Most of the mutations caused premature termination, leading Meneret et
al. (2012) to suggest that the disorders result from PRRT2
haploinsufficiency.

Schubert et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous 649dupC mutation in the
PRRT2 gene in 39 of 49 families with BFIS2 and in 1 patient with
sporadic occurrence of the disorder (77% of index cases). Three
additional heterozygous PRRT2 mutations (see, e.g., 614386.0013;
614386.0014) were found in 3 other families with the disorder. The
patients were of German, Italian, Japanese, and Turkish origin. Some of
the families had previously been reported by Striano et al. (2006) and
Weber et al. (2004). The 649dupC mutation, which occurs in an unstable
DNA sequence of 9 cytosines, arose independently in families of
different origin. Some unaffected family members also carried the
mutation, indicating incomplete penetrance.

Ono et al. (2012) identified the 649dupC mutation in 14 of 15 Japanese
families with EKD1, some of whom also had ICCA, and in 2 Japanese
families with BFIS2. The mutation was shown to occur de novo in at least
1 family, suggesting that it is a mutation hotspot. EKD1, ICCA, and
BFIS2 segregated with the mutation even within the same family. The
findings indicated that all 3 disorders are allelic and are likely
caused by a similar mechanism.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Heron and Dibbens (2013) reviewed the role of PRRT2 in 3 common
neurologic disorders, EKD1, ICCA, and BFIS2, noting that there are no
clear genotype/phenotype correlations.

PRRT2, 1-BP DUP, 649C

In affected members of 6 unrelated Han Chinese families with episodic
kinesigenic dyskinesia-1 (EKD1; 128200), Chen et al. (2011) identified a
heterozygous 1-bp duplication (649dupC) in exon 2 of the PRRT2 gene in
the proline-rich domain, resulting in a frameshift and introduction of a
stop codon 7 amino acids downstream of the insertion (Arg217ProfsTer8).
The mutation was found by exome sequencing of a large 4-generation
family with 17 affected individuals. The mutation completely segregated
with the phenotype in each family and was not found in unaffected family
members. The mutation was not found in 1,000 Han Chinese controls.
Expression of a truncated form of PRRT2 in COS-7 cells showed loss of
membrane targeting and localization of the truncated protein in the
cytoplasm. A 189-kb common haplotype flanking the mutation was found in
3 of the families, a second different haplotype was found in 2 other
families, and a third haplotype was found in the third family. Clinical
features of the proband of 1 family was described in detail. He had
onset at age 6 years of dystonic posturing of the head and arm, usually
triggered by standing up quickly. This occurred up to 10 times per day,
and lasted about 5 to 10 minutes. Brain MRI and EEG were normal at age 9
years. Treatment with carbamazepine resulted in complete symptom
resolution.

Using a combination of exome sequencing and linkage analysis in a large
Han Chinese family with EKD1, Wang et al. (2011) independently and
simultaneously identified a heterozygous 649dupC mutation in the PRRT2
gene that completely segregated with the phenotype. The mutation was
predicted to result in a truncated protein containing only 223 amino
acids and lacking the transmembrane segment. Two patients in the family
also had infantile convulsion and choreoathetosis syndrome (ICCA;
602066). Analysis of 3 additional Chinese Han families with EKD1
revealed that 2 carried the 649dupC mutation. The mutation was not found
in 500 controls. There was some phenotypic variability: the first family
had dystonia, choreoathetosis or athetosis, the second family had
predominant dystonia of the upper limbs, whereas the third had
predominant dystonia of the lower limbs.

In affected members of 3 unrelated families with familial infantile
convulsions with paroxysmal choreoathetosis, Heron et al. (2012)
identified a heterozygous 649dupC mutation. This heterozygous mutation
was also found in 12 unrelated families with benign familial infantile
seizures-2 (BFIS2; 605751). Overall, the 649dupC mutation was found in
15 (79%) of the 19 families with ICCA or BFIS2 studied. There was no
evidence of a common haplotype among these families. The PRRT2 649dupC
mutation clearly occurs at a mutation hotspot, and occurs in a
homopolymer of 9 C bases adjacent to 4 G bases. This DNA sequence has
the potential to form a hairpin-loop structure, possibly leading to
DNA-polymerase slippage and the insertion of an extra C base during DNA
replication.

Meneret et al. (2012) found that the 649dupC mutation was the most
common mutation in a cohort of patients of European descent with
EKD1/ICCA. The mutation was present in 17 of 22 patients with PRRT2
mutations. Several unaffected family members also carried the mutation,
indicating incomplete penetrance. There were at least 5 different
haplotypes with the mutation, and it was found to occur de novo in 2
patients, indicating that it is a mutation hotspot.

Schubert et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous 649dupC mutation in the
PRRT2 gene in 39 of 49 families with BFIS2 and in 1 patient with
sporadic occurrence of the disorder (77% of index cases). The patients
were of German, Italian, Japanese, and Turkish origin. The 649dupC
mutation, which occurs in an unstable DNA sequence of 9 cytosines, arose
independently in families of different origin. Some unaffected family
members also carried the mutation, indicating incomplete penetrance.

Ono et al. (2012) identified the 649dupC mutation in 14 of 15 Japanese
families with EKD1, some of whom also had ICCA, and in 2 Japanese
families with BFIS2. The mutation was shown to occur de novo in at least
1 family, suggesting that it is a mutation hotspot. EKD1, ICCA, and
BFIS2 segregated with the mutation even within the same family. The
findings indicated that all 3 disorders are allelic and are likely
caused by a similar mechanism.
