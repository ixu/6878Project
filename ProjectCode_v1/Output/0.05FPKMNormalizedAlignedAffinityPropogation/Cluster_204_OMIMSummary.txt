PCTAIRE3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The PCTAIRE protein kinases comprise a distinct subfamily of the CDC2
(116940)-related serine/threonine-specific protein kinases. See PCTK1
(311550). Meyerson et al. (1992) isolated a partial cDNA encoding
PCTAIRE3. Like other members of the PCTAIRE subfamily, the predicted
PCTAIRE3 protein contains an N-terminal extension relative to CDC2. The
CDC2-related region of PCTAIRE3, excluding the N-terminal extension,
shares 51%, 79%, and 80% protein sequence identity with CDC2, PCTK1, and
PCTK2 (603440), respectively. Northern blot analysis revealed that
PCTAIRE3 is expressed in a variety of human cell lines and tissues.
Okuda et al. (1992) identified the mouse homolog of PCTK3.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Okuda et al. (1994) mapped the
CDK18 gene to 1q31-q32.

;;B-CELL CLL/LYMPHOMA 7; BCL7
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chromosome 12q24.1 is the site of a recurrent breakpoint in high-grade
B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (BNHL). To identify the gene(s) in the
12q24.1 region, Zani et al. (1996) performed molecular cloning of a
3-way translocation t(8;14;12)(q24.1;q32.3;q24.1) in a Burkitt lymphoma
cell line; all translocation breakpoints were cloned and sequenced.
Analysis of the der(12)(12;14)(q24.1;q32.3) breakpoint showed a CpG
island from 12q24.1 juxtaposed in a tail-to-tail configuration with a
productively rearranged V-D-J heavy chain gene. A total of 4.5 kb of
genomic DNA was shown to contain a potential 92-bp exon within the
centromeric boundary of the CpG island. This was used as a probe to
identify an RNA transcript of 3.8 kb expressed at low levels in a wide
variety of normal tissues. The longest open reading frame predicted a
serine-rich protein of 231 amino acids. This protein, designated BCL7A
by the authors, showed homology with the actin-binding protein caldesmon
(114213).

Jadayel et al. (1998) identified 2 genes, BCL7B (605846) and BCL7C
(605847), encoding proteins that share 90% identity with the N-terminal
51 amino acids of BCL7A as well as 41% identity in the same region with
Drosophila and C. elegans sequences. They suggested that the 3 genes are
members of an evolutionarily conserved gene family.

CYTOGENETICS

In the Burkitt lymphoma cell line Wein 133 containing a 3-way
translocation, Zani et al. (1996) found that the BCL7A breakpoint
occurred within the first intron and resulted in a free-of-fusion
transcript between MYC (190080) and BCL7A, with exon 1 of BCL7A being
replaced by MYC exon 1. The normal, untranslocated allele of BCL7A was
also expressed without mutation. Another BNHLs with 12q24.1 cytogenetic
abnormalities showed biallelic rearrangement within the first intron of
BCL7A, which was adjacent to the breakpoint observed in Wein 133. Zani
et al. (1996) concluded that disruption of the N terminus of BCL7A
defined a new mechanism in the pathogenesis of a subset of high-grade
BNHL.

MAPPING

The BCL7A gene maps to chromosome 12q24.1 (Zani et al., 1996).

611501	TITLE *611501 CALMODULIN-BINDING TRANSCRIPTION ACTIVATOR 1; CAMTA1
;;KIAA0833
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned CAMTA1, which they designated
KIAA0833. RT-PCR ELISA detected moderate expression in adult brain and
in all specific brain regions examined. Little to no expression was
detected in all other tissues examined, including fetal brain.

Nakajima et al. (2002) obtained a full-length CAMTA1 cDNA. The deduced
protein contains 1,734 amino acids.

By searching for genes similar to a plant Camta, Bouche et al. (2002)
identified human CAMTA1 and CAMTA2 (611508). Both deduced proteins
contain an N-terminal DNA-binding CG1 domain, followed by a central
transcription factor immunoglobulin (TIG) domain, 2 ankyrin repeats for
protein-protein interactions, and 4 C-terminal calmodulin
(114180)-binding IQ motifs. The CG1 domain includes a nuclear
localization signal.

By searching for genes in a region of chromosome 1 frequently deleted in
neuroblastomas, Katoh and Katoh (2003) identified CAMTA1. The deduced
protein contains 1,673 amino acids and shares 94.1% identity with mouse
Camta1.

By immunohistochemical analysis of a neuroblastoma cell line, Nakatani
et al. (2004) found that CAMTA1 was cytosolic.

Thevenon et al. (2012) found that embryonic mice had global brain
expression of Camta1 that became restricted to the cerebellum,
hippocampi, and olfactory bulbs later in development. Camta1 was
expressed in the whole brain at embryonic day 15.5. At embryonic day
18.5, staining was marked in the cortical plate and reduced in the
ventricular zone. The olfactory system and the cerebellar anlage were
also positive. At P4, staining was found in the olfactory system, the
superficial layer of the cortical plate, the gyrus dentate of the
hippocampus, and in the vermian external granular layer of the
cerebellum. At P14, staining was restricted to the olfactory system and
the internal granular layer of the cerebellar vermis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Katoh and Katoh (2003) determined that the CAMTA1 gene contains 23
exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the CAMTA1
gene to chromosome 1. Nakatani et al. (2004) stated that the CAMTA1 gene
maps to chromosome 1p36.

GENE FUNCTION

Bouche et al. (2002) found that CAMTA1 and CAMTA2 activated
transcription of a reporter gene in yeast.

Song et al. (2006) showed that mouse Camta1 and Camta2 activated the Anf
(NPPA; 108780) promoter.

Using RT-PCR, Nakatani et al. (2004) found that expression of CAMTA1 was
highest in S and M phases and lowest in G0/G1 phase in synchronized
neuroblastoma cells. CAMTA2 levels did not change with the cell cycle.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using array CGH, Thevenon et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous
intragenic deletion in the CAMTA1 gene (611501.0001) in affected members
of a large family with early-onset nonprogressive cerebellar ataxia and
mild mental retardation (CANPMR; 614756). Another family with a similar
phenotype had a heterozygous intragenic duplication in the CAMTA1 gene
(611501.0002). Both of these disruptions were predicted to lead to a
frameshift and premature termination. An unrelated child with ataxia but
milder cognitive involvement had a different in-frame deletion within
the gene (611501.0003). All of the rearrangements affected the CG1
domain of the protein. DNA sequencing analysis of the CAMTA1 gene in a
cohort of 197 patients with intellectual disability or nonprogressive
cerebellar ataxia did not identify any point mutations, suggesting that
microrearrangements of the CAMTA1 are the most frequent mutations.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CEREBELLAR ATAXIA, NONPROGRESSIVE, WITH MENTAL RETARDATION
CAMTA1, 81-KB DEL, EX4

In affected members of a family with nonprogressive cerebellar ataxia
with mild mental retardation (CANPMR; 614756), Thevenon et al. (2012)
identified a heterozygous 81-kb deletion in the DNA-binding CG1 domain
of the CAMTA1 gene, resulting in the deletion of exon 4, a frameshift,
and premature termination. The deletion was identified using array CGH,
and the effects were confirmed by analysis of mRNA from patient
fibroblasts. In this family, 2 adult half sisters had mild mental
retardation, attended schools for special needs, and worked at simple
jobs. Both had ataxic gait with static instability; 1 had mild intention
tremor. Brain MRI of both women showed mild hippocampal atrophy,
simplified gyration of the dentate gyri, posterior cortical atrophy, and
cerebellar atrophy. PET scan of 1 woman showed hypometabolism of several
cerebral brain regions. One of the women had 2 affected sons, and the
other had 3 affected children. All patients had mental retardation,
usually with delayed psychomotor development, and all had gait
instability or frank ataxia. More variable features included strabismus,
infantile hypotonia, delayed speech, and myoclonic seizures of the upper
arm (1 patient). Some patients had mild dysmorphic facial features. The
mother of the women reportedly had mild intellectual disability.

.0002
CEREBELLAR ATAXIA, NONPROGRESSIVE, WITH MENTAL RETARDATION
CAMTA1, 539-KB DUP, EX3-5

In affected members of a family with nonprogressive cerebellar ataxia
and mild mental retardation (614756), Thevenon et al. (2012) identified
a heterozygous 539-kb duplication in the CG1 domain of the CAMTA1 gene.
RT-PCR analysis of patient fibroblasts showed only normal mRNA; the
quantity of mutant mRNA was lower than the sensitivity of the
experiment. In this family, a mother and her son and daughter were
affected. All had mild intellectual disability, and the mother and
daughter had ataxic gait. The 2 children had delayed psychomotor
development with speech delay. One had neonatal hypotonia and the other
had autistic features, poor interactive skills, and bursts of
aggression. Mild facial dysmorphism was noted.

.0003
CEREBELLAR ATAXIA, NONPROGRESSIVE, WITH MENTAL RETARDATION
CAMTA1, 49-KB DEL, EX2-3

In a girl with nonprogressive cerebellar ataxia with mild mental
retardation (614756), Thevenon et al. (2012) identified a de novo
heterozygous 49-kb deletion in the CG1 domain of the CAMTA1 gene,
resulting in the deletion of exons 2-3, which would not alter the
reading frame. The developmental delay in this child was not as severe
as in those with truncating mutations (see 611501.0001 and 611501.0002).

602521	TITLE *602521 MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE 7; MAPK7
;;PROTEIN KINASE, MITOGEN-ACTIVATED, 7; PRKM7;;
EXTRACELLULAR SIGNAL-REGULATED KINASE 5; ERK5
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs, or PRKMs) are activated by an
upstream cascade of kinases in response to a wide variety of
extracellular stimuli. Specific PRKM kinases (MAPKKs, or PRKMKs) have
been shown to phosphorylate and activate specific PRKMs in a given
signaling pathway. Using the yeast 2-hybrid system with mutant forms of
PRKMK5 (602520) as baits, Zhou et al. (1995) identified a cDNA encoding
MAPK7, called ERK5 by them. They demonstrated that MAPK7 interacts
specifically with PRKMK5, but not with PRKMK1 (176872) or PRKMK2
(601263), suggesting that the PRKMK5/MAPK7 protein cascade is a novel
signaling pathway. The 815-amino acid MAPK7 contains the conserved
thr-glu-tyr activation motif of ERK-type MAPKs. MAPK7 has an
uncharacteristic 400-amino acid C-terminal domain with sequences
indicating that it may be targeted to the cytoskeleton. Zhou et al.
(1995) found that full-length MAPK7 has no detectable kinase activity in
vitro, whereas removal of the C terminus results in autophosphorylation,
suggesting that the C terminus may play a role in regulating MAPK7.
Northern blot analysis detected a 3.1-kb transcript in a number of human
tissues, with the highest levels in heart and skeletal muscle.

By degenerate PCR, Lee et al. (1995) isolated a cDNA encoding a PRKM
which they named BMK1. BMK1 shows 98% amino acid identity to ERK5; they
differ in a short span of residues at the N terminus. Lee et al. (1995)
speculated that these kinases are derived from the same gene, possibly
via differential mRNA splicing.

MAPPING

By PCR analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel, Purandare et al. (1998)
mapped the MAPK7 gene to human chromosome 17p11.2.

GENE FUNCTION

Thymocyte emigration after positive selection requires KLF2 (602016)
expression. Although KLF2 expression by endothelial cells requires ERK5,
which is phosphorylated in response to IL7 (146660), Weinreich et al.
(2011) found that Erk5-deficient mouse T cells underwent normal
development and had no Klf2 deficiency. They concluded that IL7 and ERK5
do not control KLF2 or the semimature to mature single-positive
thymocyte transition.

ANIMAL MODEL

To assess the biologic role of MAPK7 (called ERK5 by them), Regan et al.
(2002) deleted the gene in mice. Inactivation of the gene resulted in
defective blood vessel and cardiac development leading to embryonic
lethality around embryonic day 9.5 to 10.5. Cardiac development was
retarded, and the heart failed to undergo normal looping. Endothelial
cells that line the developing myocardium of erk5 -/- embryos displayed
a disorganized, rounded morphology. Vasculogenesis occurred, but
extraembryonic and embryonic blood vessels were disorganized and failed
to mature. Furthermore, the investment of embryonic blood vessels with
smooth muscle cells was attenuated.

Hayashi et al. (2004) found that targeted ablation of MAPK7 using the
Mx1-Cre transgene in adult mice led to lethality within 2 to 4 weeks
after the induction of Cre recombinase. Physiologic analysis showed that
blood vessels became abnormally leaky after deletion of the MAPK7 gene;
histologically, the endothelial cells lining the leaky blood vessels
were round, irregularly aligned, and ultimately apoptotic. In vitro
removal of MAPK7 also led to the death of endothelial cells, partially
due to the downregulation of transcriptional factor MEF2C (600662),
which is a direct substrate of MAPK7. In addition, endothelial-specific
Mapk7 knockout led to cardiovascular defects identical to that of global
Mapk7 -/- mice, but mice lacking Mapk7 only in cardiomyocytes developed
to term with no apparent defects. Hayashi et al. (2004) concluded that
the MAPK7 pathway is critical for endothelial function and maintenance
of blood vessel integrity.

603413	TITLE *603413 TIA1 CYTOTOXIC GRANULE-ASSOCIATED RNA-BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE 1; TIAL1
;;TIA1-RELATED PROTEIN; TIAR;;
T CLUSTER-BINDING PROTEIN; TCBP
DESCRIPTION Cytotoxic lymphocytes can induce target cells to activate apoptosis.
Central to this autolytic pathway is the activation of an endogenous
endonuclease that degrades target cell DNA. By screening a human
phytohemagglutinin-activated T-cell cDNA library with a TIA1 (603518)
cDNA, Kawakami et al. (1992) cloned a cDNA encoding TIA1-related protein
(TIAR). Both TIAR and TIA1 are members of a family of RNA-binding
proteins containing 3 RNA-binding domains and a C-terminal auxiliary
domain. Like TIA1, TIAR possesses a lysosome-targeting motif in its
C-terminal auxiliary domain, suggesting that TIAR is also a cytotoxic
granule-associated protein. The authors demonstrated that TIAR binds
specifically to poly(A) homopolymers, fragments DNA in permeabilized
target cells, and is expressed in a wide variety of hematopoietic and
nonhematopoietic cell types.

Using a Southwestern approach to identify proteins capable of binding to
the T cluster of the platelet factor-4 (PF4; 173460) promoter, Doi et
al. (1997) isolated a human erythroleukemia (HEL) cell cDNA encoding an
isoform of TIAL1, which they called TCBP. This deduced 265-amino acid
isoform differs from the isoform identified by Kawakami et al. (1992) at
the C terminus, where a hydrophobic sequence replaces the
lysosome-targeting motif. Doi et al. (1997) demonstrated that TCBP
specifically binds to the T cluster and the proximal T-rich region of
the PF4 promoter in vitro and that TCBP reduces gene expression from the
PF4 promoter. TCBP mRNA expression was reduced when HEL cells were
induced to differentiate to megakaryocytes.

By hybridization to YACs and radiation hybrid mapping, Doi et al. (1997)
localized the TIAL1 gene to 10q, 4.92 cR distal to WI-5255.

143023	TITLE *143023 RAS ASSOCIATION DOMAIN FAMILY, MEMBER 7; RASSF7
;;CHROMOSOME 11 OPEN READING FRAME 13; C11ORF13;;
HRAS1-RELATED CLUSTER 1; HRC1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Weitzel et al. (1992) cloned RASSF7, which they called HRC1. An HRC1
cDNA probe recognized fragments on Southern blots of DNA from other
vertebrate species. In human DNA, multiple homologous fragments were
detected in addition to the predicted ones containing HRC1. HRC1
expression was upregulated with HRAS1 in a bladder carcinoma cell line,
suggesting coordinate regulation. The deduced 373-amino acid protein
contains regions rich in glutamine and proline and a region similar to
the helix-loop-helix motif adjacent to a C-terminal leucine zipper
dimerization motif with 4 heptad repeats.

GENE FUNCTION

Sherwood et al. (2008) found that Xenopus Rassf7 was expressed in
several embryonic tissues, including skin, eye, and neural tube, and
localized to centrosomes in a microtubule-dependent manner. Knockdown of
Rassf7 in Xenopus embryos caused mitotic spindle failure, arrest in
mitosis, nuclear breakdown, apoptosis, and loss of tissue architecture
in neural tube.

MAPPING

Weitzel et al. (1992) characterized a 55-kb region of DNA surrounding
HRAS1 (190020) on chromosome 11. They found that it contains a cluster
of 2, and possibly 3, genes associated with CpG islands within the 32 kb
immediately upstream of HRAS1. One of these loci, located 29 kb upstream
of HRAS1 and provisionally designated HRC1, is divergently transcribed.

612719	TITLE *612719 6-@PYRUVOYL-TETRAHYDROPTERIN SYNTHASE; PTS
;;PTPS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The PTS gene encodes 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase (EC 4.6.1.10),
an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), an
essential cofactor for aromatic amino acid hydroxylases, such as hepatic
phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH; 612349), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH;
191290), and tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH1; 191060), as well as for all 3
forms of nitric oxide synthase (see, e.g., NOS1, 163731) (Thony et al.,
1992).

CLONING

Thony et al. (1992) isolated clones corresponding to the PTS gene from a
human hepatic cDNA library. The deduced 145-residue protein has a
molecular mass of 16.4 kD. The human amino acid sequence showed 82%
identity with the rat liver sequence. Expression of the cDNA in E. coli
yielded the active enzyme and showed immunoreactivity with antibodies
against the rat liver PTS.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kluge et al. (1996) determined that the PTS gene spans about 8 kb and
contains 6 exons, as revealed by DNA sequence analysis. The authors
noted that this gene structure differed from that reported by Ashida et
al. (1994).

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, Thony et al. (1994) localized the PTS gene to
chromosome 11q22.3-q23.3.

- Pseudogene

Kluge et al. (1996) identified a retropseudogene, PTS-P1, on chromosome
9p13-p12.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Thony et al. (1994) identified mutations in the PTS gene (e.g.,
612719.0001-612719.0003) in patients with BH4-deficient
hyperphenylalaninemia (HPABH4A; 261640).

Oppliger et al. (1997) identified 4 novel mutations in 4 Italian
families with BH4-deficient hyperphenylalaninemia due to PTS deficiency.

Thony and Blau (1997) reviewed the spectrum of mutations in the PTS gene
resulting in tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency. They stated that compound
heterozygous or homozygous mutations spread over all 6 exons of the gene
can cause an autosomal recessive variant of hyperphenylalaninemia,
mostly accompanied by a deficiency of dopamine and serotonin.

HISTORY

Niederwieser et al. (1985) noted that this enzyme has sometimes been
referred to as 'dihydrobiopterin synthetase,' since it is deficient in
the most frequent of the rare BH4-deficient variants of
hyperphenylalaninemia (261640). The molecular defect involves a
phosphate-eliminating enzyme that catalyzes the elimination of inorganic
triphosphate from dihydroneopterin triphosphate, the second and
irreversible step in the biosynthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin (Heintel et
al., 1985). This so-called phosphate-eliminating enzyme was later called
6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase.

ANIMAL MODEL

Sumi-Ichinose et al. (2001) established mice unable to synthesize BH4 by
disrupting the Pts gene. Homozygous mice were born almost at the
expected mendelian ratio, but died within 48 hours of birth. In the
brains of homozygous mutant neonates, levels of biopterin,
catecholamines, and serotonin were extremely low. Tyrosine hydroxylase
(TH; 191290) activity was severely impaired by BH4 depletion, and TH
immunoreactivity was reduced in the nerve terminals, but not in the cell
bodies. The catecholaminergic, serotonergic, and nitric oxide systems
were differentially affected by BH4 starvation and were variably rescued
by BH4 administration.

Elzaouk et al. (2003) rescued Pts-null mice from neonatal mortality by
daily oral administration of BH4 and neurotransmitter precursors.
However, at sexual maturity (6 weeks) mutant mice had only one-third the
normal body weight and were sexually immature. Biochemical analysis
revealed no hyperphenylalaninemia, normal brain NOS activity, and almost
normal serotonin levels, but brain dopamine was 3% of normal. Low
dopamine led to impaired food consumption, as reflected by the severe
growth deficiency and 7-fold reduced serum Igf1 (147440) levels.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPERPHENYLALANINEMIA, BH4-DEFICIENT, A
PTS, ARG25GLN

In a Pakistani infant, born of first-cousin parents, with BH4-deficient
hyperphenylalaninemia due to PTS deficiency (HPABH4A; 261640), Thony et
al. (1994) identified a homozygous G-to-A transition in the PTS gene,
resulting in an arg25-to-gln (R25Q) substitution. The infant was of low
birth weight for gestational age. Expression of the mutant allele in E.
coli revealed 14% activity when compared with the wildtype enzyme.

.0002
HYPERPHENYLALANINEMIA, BH4-DEFICIENT, A, DUE TO PARTIAL PTS DEFICIENCY
PTS, ARG16CYS

In a patient with hyperphenylalaninemia due to partial PTS deficiency
(see 261640), Thony et al. (1994) identified compound heterozygosity for
2 mutations in the PTS gene: a C-to-T transition, resulting in an
arg16-to-cys (R16C) substitution, and a 14-bp deletion extending from
C370 to C383, leading to a premature stop codon (612719.0003).
Heterologous expression of the enzyme with the R16C mutation revealed
only 7% enzyme activity, whereas expression of the deletion allele
exhibited no detectable activity. Levels of neurotransmitter metabolites
in cerebrospinal fluid of the patient were in the normal range.

HYPERPHENYLALANINEMIA, BH4-DEFICIENT, A
PTS, ASN52SER

In a study of 19 unrelated Chinese families with BH4-deficient
hyperphenylalaninemia due to PTS deficiency (261640), Liu et al. (1998)
found that an asn52-to-ser (N52S) mutation in the PTS gene accounted for
48% of southern Chinese mutations but only 1 (9%) of northern Chinese
mutant alleles. The allele was associated with severe clinical symptoms.

.0005
HYPERPHENYLALANINEMIA, BH4-DEFICIENT, A
PTS, PRO87SER

In a study of 19 unrelated Chinese families with PTS-deficient
hyperphenylalaninemia (261640), Liu et al. (1998) identified a
pro87-to-ser (P87S) substitution. Together, the P87S and N52S
(612719.0004) mutations accounted for 71% of Chinese PTS mutant alleles.
The P87S mutation was associated with severe clinical symptoms.

.0006
HYPERPHENYLALANINEMIA, BH4-DEFICIENT, A
PTS, VAL56MET

Liu et al. (1998) found that the val56-to-met (V56M) mutation in the PTS
gene was associated with a clinically mild form of BH4-deficient
hyperphenylalaninemia (261640).

.0007
HYPERPHENYLALANINEMIA, BH4-DEFICIENT, A, DUE TO PARTIAL PTS DEFICIENCY
PTS, ASN47ASP

Scherer-Oppliger et al. (1999) reported an Italian infant with transient
hyperphenylalaninemia associated with PTS deficiency (see 261640) in red
blood cells. CSF showed marginally decreased 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid
(5-HIAA) and normal homovanillic acid (HVA). Serum phenylalanine
normalized with treatment and remained normal after treatment was
stopped, and the child developed normally. Genetic analysis identified
compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the PTS gene: a 139A-G
transition resulting in an asn47-to-asp (N47D) substitution inherited
from the mother, and a 347A-G transition resulting in an asp116-to-gly
(D116G) substitution (612710.0008) inherited from the father. In vitro
cellular expression studies showed that the N47D allele was inactive,
whereas the D116G allele had about 66% residual activity. However,
cellular cotransfection of both mutant alleles showed that the N47D
allele had a dominant-negative effect on both the wildtype PTS and the
D116G mutant, with a relative reduction of enzyme activity to about 20%
of control values. The patient had 5.9% residual PTS activity in red
blood cells and 0.16% in fibroblasts. Scherer-Oppliger et al. (1999)
noted that the findings could not explain the transient phenotype in the
patient, and speculated that the N47D allele may have changed expression
in the liver with age, disappeared over time, or perhaps degraded.

HYPERPHENYLALANINEMIA, BH4-DEFICIENT, A
PTS, ASP96ASN

Liu et al. (1998) found that an asp96-to-asn (D96N) mutation in the PTS
gene was associated with a clinically severe form of BH4-deficient
hyperphenylalaninemia (261640).

.0010
HYPERPHENYLALANINEMIA, BH4-DEFICIENT, A
PTS, 55-BP DEL, NT694

Meili et al. (2009) reported a patient with BH4-deficient
hyperphenylalaninemia resulting from a mutation that created a
pseudoexon in the PTS gene. They identified a heterozygous 55-bp
deletion in intron 2 that removed the poly(T) tail of the right arm of
the antisense Alu sequence bringing a favorable branch point sequence
within proximity of the pseudoexon 3-prime splice site and removing an
upstream AG dinucleotide required for the 3-prime splice site repression
on normal alleles. They found a reduced amount of correctly spliced
transcript and a longer cDNA containing 45 extra nucleotides from intron
2. These findings showed the flexibility of Alu repeats in shaping
intron-exon structures. RT-PCR analysis of dermal fibroblasts showed
both correctly spliced transcript and the larger cDNA fragment
containing the pseudoexon.

.0011
HYPERPHENYLALANINEMIA, BH4-DEFICIENT, A
PTS, IVS1, -322A-T

Meili et al. (2009) reported a patient with mild form of BH4-deficient
hyperphenylalaninemia resulting from a mutation that created a
pseudoexon in the PTS gene. They identified a homozygous A-to-T
transversion (IVS1-322A-T) located 9 nucleotides upstream of its 3-prime
splice site in a LINE-2 sequence, providing the first example of a
disease-causing exonization of the most ancient interspersed repeat.
This finding expanded the spectrum of mutational mechanisms that
introduce repetitive sequences in mature transcripts. RT-PCR analysis of
dermal fibroblasts showed both correctly splice transcript and a larger
cDNA fragment containing an extra 79 nucleotides between PTS exons 1 and
2.

602931	TITLE *602931 MOTHERS AGAINST DECAPENTAPLEGIC, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 6; SMAD6
;;MADH6;;
SMA- AND MAD-RELATED PROTEIN 6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MAD-related proteins, named for Drosophila 'mothers against
decapentaplegic,' act as second messengers distal to the transforming
growth factor-beta family of receptors (e.g., TGFBR1; 190181).

CLONING

Using a differential display approach in cultured endothelial cells
subjected to multiple soluble and biomechanical stimuli, Topper et al.
(1997) isolated a human endothelial cell cDNA encoding MADH6, which they
called SMAD6. The predicted 235-amino acid MADH6 protein exhibits
significant sequence similarity to other human MAD-related proteins,
including the presence of a C-terminal MH2 domain; however, it lacks the
conserved N-terminal MH1 domain, and certain conserved C-terminal serine
residues that are involved in receptor-mediated phosphorylation. In situ
hybridization and immunohistochemical studies on human tissues showed
that MADH6 is expressed predominantly in vascular endothelium.

MAPPING

Riggins et al. (1996) reported an expressed sequence tag containing the
C-terminal sequence of MADH6. By PCR screening of a somatic cell hybrid
panel and YACs, they mapped the MADH6 gene to 15q21-q22.

GENE FUNCTION

Topper et al. (1997) demonstrated that MADH6 and MADH7 (602932) can form
complexes in endothelial cells. MADH6 was induced in cultured vascular
endothelium by fluid mechanical forces, and it modulated endothelial
gene expression in response to both humoral and biomechanical stimuli in
vitro.

Galvin et al. (2000) explored the role of an inhibitory SMAD in vivo by
targeted mutation of Madh6, which encodes the Smad6 protein, in mice.
Targeted insertion of a LacZ reporter demonstrated that Smad6 expression
is largely restricted to the heart and blood vessels, and that Madh6
mutants have multiple cardiovascular abnormalities. Hyperplasia of the
cardiac valves and outflow tract septation defects indicated a function
of Smad6 in the regulation of endocardial cushion transformation. The
role of Smad6 in the homeostasis of the adult cardiovascular system was
indicated by the development of aortic ossification and elevated blood
pressure in viable mutants. These defects highlighted the importance of
SMAD6 in the tissue-specific modulation of TGFB superfamily signaling
pathways in vivo.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 patients with bicuspid aortic valve and aortic valve stenosis
(AOVD2; 614823), 1 of whom also had aortic coarctation, Tan et al.
(2012) identified heterozygosity for missense mutations in the SMAD6
gene (602931.0001, 602931.0002). Neither mutation was found in more than
1,800 controls, and both mutants had significantly lower activity than
wildtype SMAD6.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
AORTIC VALVE DISEASE 2
SMAD6, CYS484PHE

In a man with bicuspid aortic valve, aortic valve stenosis, and
coarctation and calcification of the aorta (AOVD2; 614823), Tan et al.
(2012) identified heterozygosity for a nonsynonymous variant in exon 4
of SMAD6, resulting in a cys484-to-phe (C484F) substitution at a highly
conserved residue within the MH2 domain. The mutation was not found in
1,000 Caucasian controls of British ancestry, in 629 individuals in the
1000 Genomes project, or in 200 individuals in the Danish Exome Project.
Functional analysis demonstrated that the MH2 domain of the mutant
protein inhibited BMP (see 112264) signaling less efficiently than the
equivalent domain of wildtype SMAD6, with relative luciferase readings
that were 24-fold higher than wildtype. Tan et al. (2012) suggested that
C484F could be considered a null allele, since there was almost no
inhibitory effect on BMPR1A (601299) activity in the assay.

.0002
AORTIC VALVE DISEASE 2
SMAD6, PRO415LEU

In an infant with bicuspid aortic valve and moderate aortic stenosis
(AOVD2; 614823), Tan et al. (2012) identified heterozygosity for a
nonsynonymous variant in exon 4 of SMAD6, resulting in a pro415-to-leu
(P415L) substitution at a highly conserved residue within the MH2
domain. The mutation was not found in 1,000 Caucasian controls of
British ancestry, in 629 individuals in the 1000 Genomes project, or in
200 individuals in the Danish Exome Project. Functional analysis
demonstrated that the MH2 domain of the mutant protein inhibited BMP
(see 112264) signaling less efficiently than the equivalent domain of
wildtype SMAD6, with relative luciferase readings that were 7-fold
higher than wildtype, consistent with a hypomorphic allele.

605176	TITLE *605176 HYDROXYACID OXIDASE 2; HAO2
;;HAOX2;;
HYDROXYACID OXIDASE, LONG-CHAIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

2-Hydroxyacid oxidases can oxidize a broad range of 2-hydroxyacids,
ranging from glycolate to long-chain 2-hydroxy fatty acids such as
2-hydroxypalmitate. These enzymes utilize a flavin cofactor and convert
2-hydroxyacids to 2-ketoacids with the concomitant reduction of
molecular oxygen to hydrogen peroxide.

CLONING

The plant glycolate oxidase (GOX; EC 1.1.3.15), which has an essential
role in photorespiration, is a prototypic 2-hydroxyacid oxidase. By
searching an EST database for human cDNAs capable of encoding proteins
with sequence similarity to spinach GOX, Jones et al. (2000) identified
HAO1 (605023) and HAO2; they stated in an erratum that the cDNA they had
identified as human HAO3 (HAOX3) actually belonged to mouse. The
predicted 351-amino acid HAO2 protein, which the authors called HAOX2,
terminates in the consensus type 1 peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS1)
serine-arginine-leucine. Indirect immunofluorescence indicated that HAO2
localizes to the peroxisome. HAO2 shares 46.7% amino acid sequence
identity identity with spinach GOX and 46.0% identity with HAO1.
Recombinant HAO2 had 2-hydroxyacid oxidase activity, with highest
activity toward 2-hydroxypalmitate. Northern blot analysis of 16 human
tissues detected an approximately 2.0-kb HAO2 transcript at high levels
in both liver and kidney, and at a low level in thymus.

MAPPING

Jones et al. (2000) noted that a region of the HAO2 gene corresponds to
an STS on chromosome 1.

605765	TITLE *605765 DELETED IN LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA, 1; DLEU1
;;LEU1;;
B-CELL NEOPLASIA-ASSOCIATED GENE WITH MULTIPLE SPLICING; BCMS
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Loss of chromosome 13q14 is a frequent cytogenetic change in B-cell
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (BCLL; see 109543), suggesting the presence
of a putative tumor suppressor gene at this locus. By constructing a
detailed restriction and transcriptional map of a 130-kb minimally
deleted region, screening a panel of primary BCLL clones, EST database
searching, and deletion mapping, Liu et al. (1997) identified 2 genes,
DLEU1 and DLEU2 (605766), which they called Leu1 and Leu2, in a 10-kb
minimally deleted area. The DLEU1 gene encodes a deduced 72-amino acid
protein. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a 1.1-kb
transcript, with strong expression in testis, thymus, and small
intestine and lower expression in prostate, spleen, peripheral blood
lymphocytes, and ovary.

Wolf et al. (2001) determined that DLEU1 is only a small portion of a
large gene, which they designated B-cell neoplasia-associated gene with
multiple splicing (BCMS), that spans all critical subregions for BCLL,
including the distal subregion. They found that the gene is expressed in
more than 20 RNA splicing variants. While tissue-specific expression of
RNA variants was observed, there was no evidence for the expression of a
variant specific for BCLL. Sequence analysis of the RNA variants
suggested that BCMS transcripts belong to the group of noncoding RNAs.

GENE STRUCTURE

Liu et al. (1997) determined that the DLEU1 gene lacks a TATA box but
has several potential cis-acting DNA elements. Genomic sequence analysis
determined that DLEU1 and DLEU2 are approximately 300 bp apart, arranged
in a head-to-head manner, and transcribed in opposite directions.
Mutation analysis failed to detect any intragenic or point mutations,
but the first exon of each gene was deleted in all cases of 13q14 loss
examined. Liu et al. (1997) proposed that DLEU1 and DLEU2 are candidate
tumor suppressor genes in BCLL.

Wolf et al. (2001) determined that the BCMS gene contains at least 50
exons spanning 560 kb or more of genomic DNA. The alignment of the gene
with all critical subregions for BCLL was consistent with BCMS being the
most likely candidate for the tumor suppressor gene in 13q14 involved in
the leukemogenesis of BCLL.

613349	TITLE *613349 ORNITHINE AMINOTRANSFERASE; OAT
;;ORNITHINE KETO ACID AMINOTRANSFERASE; OKT;;
ORNITHINE DELTA-AMINOTRANSFERASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ornithine aminotransferase (OAT; EC 2.6.1.13) is a mitochondrial matrix
enzyme that catalyzes the reversible transamination of ornithine to
glutamate semialdehyde (Valle and Simell, 1983).

CLONING

Mitchell et al. (1988) isolated and sequenced OAT cDNA clones from human
and rat liver cDNA libraries. The deduced human and rat proteins contain
439 amino acids and share 90.4% sequence identity. The sequence of the
human protein identified by Mitchell et al. (1988) agreed with the
protein identified from a human retinoblastoma cell library by Inana et
al. (1986).

GENE STRUCTURE

Mitchell et al. (1988) determined that the OAT gene is 21 kb long and
contains 11 exons. The 5-prime flanking region was found to have
features of housekeeping genes (GC enrichment and 3 Sp1 binding
consensus sequences) and tissue-specific, inducible genes (TATA box-like
element and 2 CCAAT boxes).

MAPPING

By study of somatic cell hybrids, O'Donnell et al. (1985, 1988) assigned
the OAT locus to human chromosome 10 and mouse chromosome 7. Starch gel
electrophoresis with staining for OAT was used to identify the rodent
and human forms of the enzyme. Mitchell et al. (1986) presented findings
they interpreted as indicating that the OAT structural gene is on
chromosome 10. Ramesh et al. (1986, 1987) mapped the OAT locus to
10q23-qter by study of cell hybrids. Barrett et al. (1987) used a cDNA
for OAT in somatic cell hybrids and in situ hybridization to map the
gene to 10q26. OAT gene sequences were also found on the X chromosome at
Xp11.2 in the same region as a marker that is closely linked to X-linked
retinitis pigmentosa (312600); see 311240. Wu et al. (1988) presented
family linkage data locating OAT to 10q. Mitchell et al. (1988) cloned
rat and human liver OAT cDNAs which they used to map the OAT gene to
chromosome 10 and to clone genomic DNA. Ramesh et al. (1988) identified
RFLPs at the OAT locus and showed that these map to human chromosome 10.

- Pseudogenes

Mitchell et al. (1986) presented findings they interpreted as indicating
that a cluster of OAT pseudogenes is located in the region Xp21.1-p11.1.

An OAT-like sequence, OATL2, mapped by Barrett et al. (1987) to Xp11.2,
has been identified as an OAT pseudogene (Scott, 2007).

Geraghty et al. (1993) used a nearly full-length human ornithine
delta-amino transferase cDNA as a probe under low stringency
hybridization conditions to identify a new autosomal OAT-related
sequence, OATL3. Cloning and characterization of this sequence
demonstrated it to be a partial nonprocessed pseudogene corresponding to
exon 3 and flanking intronic sequences of the OAT structural gene. Using
somatic cell hybrids and fluorescence in situ hybridization, they mapped
OATL3 to 10q26, adjacent to the OAT structural gene locus.

GENE FUNCTION

Although most genetic association studies are performed with the
intention of detecting nucleotide polymorphisms that are correlated with
a complex trait, transcript abundance should also be expected to
associate with diseases or phenotypes. Passador-Gurgel et al. (2007)
performed a scan for quantitative trait transcripts in adult female
heads of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster that might explain
variation for nicotine resistance. The strongest association was seen
for abundance of ornithine aminotransferase transcripts, implicating
detoxification and neurotransmitter biosynthesis as mediators of the
quantitative response to the drug. Subsequently, genetic analysis and
metabolite profiling confirmed the complex role of ornithine and GABA
levels in modification of survival time upon chronic nicotine exposure.
Differences between populations of the fruit fly from North Carolina and
California suggested that the resistance mechanism may be an evolved
response to environmental exposure.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In patients with gyrate atrophy, Mitchell et al. (1988, 1989) identified
a homozygous mutation in the OAT gene (613349.0001).

Brody et al. (1992) discovered and characterized the molecular defect in
21 newly recognized OAT alleles. They determined the consequences of
these and 3 previously described mutations on OAT mRNA, antigen, and
enzyme activity in cultured fibroblasts. In 20 of the 24 alleles, normal
amounts of normal-sized OAT mRNA were produced. By contrast, only 2 of
the 24 had normal amounts of OAT antigen.

OAT, MET1ILE

In Lebanese Maronites with gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina
(258870), Mitchell et al. (1988, 1989) identified homozygosity for a
G-to-A change in the third nucleotide of the OAT gene, resulting in a
met1-to-ile (M1I) substitution. This is an initiator mutation, i.e., a
mutation in the initiator methionine residue.

.0002
GYRATE ATROPHY OF CHOROID AND RETINA
OAT, 1-BP DEL, 159C

An Iraqi Jewish patient with gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina
(258870) was found to be homozygous for a 1-bp deletion at nucleotide
159 (159delC) in the OAT gene, resulting in a frameshift (his53fs)
(Mitchell et al., 1989; Brody et al., 1992).

OAT, 3-BP DEL, 550GCT

A Portuguese patient with gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina
(258870) was found to be compound heterozygous for mutations in the OAT
gene. One mutation was a 3-bp deletion (550delGCT) in the OAT gene,
resulting in deletion of alanine-184 (ala184del). The other mutation was
not identified (Mitchell et al., 1989; Brody et al., 1992).

.0004
GYRATE ATROPHY OF CHOROID AND RETINA
OAT, ARG396TER

An East Indian patient with gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina
(258870) was found to be homozygous for a C-to-T transition at
nucleotide 1186 of the OAT gene, resulting in an arg396-to-ter (R396X)
substitution (Mitchell et al., 1989; Brody et al., 1992).

.0005
GYRATE ATROPHY OF CHOROID AND RETINA
OAT, TYR55HIS

In a patient of Austrian/Hungarian/British extraction with gyrate
atrophy of the choroid and retina (258870), Brody et al. (1992)
identified a T-to-C mutation at nucleotide 163 in compound heterozygous
state. The mutation resulted in a tyr55-to-his (Y55H) substitution.

.0006
GYRATE ATROPHY OF CHOROID AND RETINA
OAT, CYS93PHE

In a patient of German/Italian extraction with gyrate atrophy of the
choroid and retina (258870), Brody et al. (1992) identified a G-to-T
transversion at nucleotide 278 of the OAT gene in compound heterozygous
state. The mutation resulted in a cys93-to-phe (C93F) substitution.

.0007
GYRATE ATROPHY OF CHOROID AND RETINA
OAT, ARG154LEU

A patient with gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina (258870) was
found to be homozygous for a G-to-T transversion at nucleotide 461 in
the OAT gene, resulting in an arg154-to-leu (R154L) substitution
(Mitchell et al., 1989; Brody et al., 1992).

.0008
GYRATE ATROPHY OF CHOROID AND RETINA
OAT, ARG180THR

In affected members of 2 of 16 Finnish pedigrees with gyrate atrophy of
the choroid and retina (258870), Mitchell et al. (1989) identified
homozygosity for an arg180-to-thr (R180T) substitution in the OAT gene.
The mutation was shown to inactivate OAT.

In 2 Finnish probands, Martin et al. (1989) found homozygosity for the
R180T mutation, which was found in heterozygous state (with L402P,
613349.0011) in an American non-Finnish proband. The haplotype of the 2
Finnish R180T probands was completely distinct from that of an American
patient, indicating independent origin of the 2 mutations.

.0009
GYRATE ATROPHY OF CHOROID AND RETINA
OAT, ALA270PRO

A Portuguese patient with gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina
(258870) was found to be homozygous for a G-to-C transversion at
nucleotide 808 of the OAT gene, resulting in an ala270-to-pro (A270P)
substitution (Mitchell et al., 1989; Brody et al., 1992).

.0010
GYRATE ATROPHY OF CHOROID AND RETINA
OAT, ARG271LYS

A Japanese patient with gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina
(258870) was found to be homozygous for a G-to-A transition at
nucleotide 812 in the OAT gene, resulting in an arg271-to-lys (R271K)
substitution (Mitchell et al., 1989; Brody et al., 1992).

.0011
GYRATE ATROPHY OF CHOROID AND RETINA
OAT, LEU402PRO

In affected members of 14 of 16 Finnish pedigrees with gyrate atrophy of
the choroid and retina (258870), Mitchell et al. (1989) identified a
homozygous leu402-to-pro (L402P) substitution in the OAT gene. The
mutation was shown to inactivate OAT.

Martin et al. (1989) concluded that there are at least 3 and possibly 6
mutant OAT alleles causing gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina in
Finns. The most frequent finding was homozygosity for the L402P
mutation, found in 21 of 27 probands; all had identical RFLP haplotypes,
indicating a single origin and supporting founder effect as the cause of
the high frequency of the gene.

.0012
GYRATE ATROPHY OF CHOROID AND RETINA
OAT, PRO417LEU

In an English patient with gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina
(258870), Brody et al. (1992) identified 2 mutations on the same allele
in the OAT gene: one was a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 1250,
resulting in a pro417-to-leu substitution, and the other was a
leu437-to-phe (L437F; 613349.0013) substitution. Brody et al. (1992)
suggested that L437F is neutral and in linkage disequilibrium with the
pathologic P417L mutation.

OAT, TYR245CYS

In an English patient with gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina
(258870), Brody et al. (1992) identified an A-to-G change at nucleotide
743, resulting in a tyr245-to-cys (Y245C) substitution. The mutation was
found in compound heterozygous state (Mitchell et al., 1989).

.0017
OAT POLYMORPHISM
OAT, ASN378ASN

Mitchell et al. (1989) found a C-to-T polymorphism at nucleotide 1134
which caused no change in amino acid 378 and was consequently neutral.

.0018
GYRATE ATROPHY OF CHOROID AND RETINA WITH PYRIDOXINE-RESPONSIVE ORNITHINEMIA
OAT, VAL332MET

By cloning and sequencing cDNAs for OAT from 2 gyrate atrophy of the
choroid and retina (258870) patients, one responsive and one
nonresponsive to pyridoxine treatment, Ramesh et al. (1988) showed that
each had a single missense mutation, which was sufficient to eliminate
OAT activity when each cDNA was tested in a eukaryotic expression
system. However, like the enzyme in fibroblasts from the
pyridoxine-responsive patient, OAT encoded by the corresponding cDNA
from this individual showed a significant increase in activity when
assayed in the presence of an increased pyridoxyl phosphate
concentration. The responsive patient showed a transition mutation
(guanine to adenine) at basepair 994 that changed valine-332 to a
methionine residue (V332M). Neither mutation altered the restriction
endonuclease recognition site.

Dougherty et al. (1993) explored yeast as an expression system for OAT
by introducing a cDNA encoding the human enzyme into an ornithine
aminotransferase-deficient strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Although
the normal location of the enzyme in yeast is cytosolic, the human
enzyme expressed at high levels in S. cerevisiae was localized to the
mitochondrial matrix with correct proteolytic processing of its
mitochondrial leader sequence. Furthermore, despite the anomalous
location in yeast, the human enzyme complemented the phenotype of the
mutant strain, restoring its ability to utilize ornithine as a sole
nitrogen source. Dougherty et al. (1993) also expressed the vitamin
B6-responsive V332M allele and found that a 4-fold increase in specific
activity of the enzyme occurred when the concentration of pyridoxal
phosphate in the assay was increased from 50 to 600 microM.

.0019
GYRATE ATROPHY OF CHOROID AND RETINA
OAT, ASN54LYS

In a patient with gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina (258870) and
ornithinemia unresponsive to pyridoxine therapy, Ramesh et al. (1988)
found at the nucleotide sequence of the OAT gene a single transversion
mutation (cytosine to adenine) at basepair 162, changing asparagine-54
to lysine (N54K).

.0020
GYRATE ATROPHY OF CHOROID AND RETINA
OAT, HIS319TYR

In a 31-year-old Japanese male with gyrate atrophy of the choroid and
retina (258870) and hyperornithinemia nonresponsive to vitamin B6, Inana
et al. (1989) demonstrated compound heterozygosity at the OAT locus.
Only one allele was expressed. The expressed mRNA was cloned and
sequenced and shown to contain a single base change from C to T,
resulting in an amino acid codon change from CAT (histidine) to TAT
(tyrosine) at position 319 in the translated OAT protein. Inana et al.
(1989) synthesized mutant and normal OAT precursors in vitro and tested
them in an in vitro mitochondrial transport/processing system. Results
indicated that the mutant OAT precursor was transported to mitochondria
but minimally processed there, which would lead to degradation of the
labile precursor and loss of OAT activity.

GYRATE ATROPHY OF CHOROID AND RETINA
OAT, EX5DEL

In a gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina (258870) patient of
Swedish/Danish extraction, McClatchey et al. (1989, 1990) found deletion
of 9 bp in the 3-prime splice site of IVS4, resulting in deletion of
exon 5. The mutation was present in compound heterozygous state.

.0023
GYRATE ATROPHY OF CHOROID AND RETINA
OAT, ALU INS

In studies of mutations causing deficiency of OAT, Mitchell et al.
(1991) found, in an Algerian patient with gyrate atrophy of the choroid
and retina (258870), a gene whose mature mRNA had a 142-nucleotide
insertion at the junction of sequences from exons 3 and 4. The insert
derived from an Alu element in intron 3 of the OAT gene, oriented in the
direction opposite to transcription, i.e., in 'antisense Alu.' A
guanine-to-cytosine transversion created a donor splice site in this
Alu, thereby activating a cryptic acceptor splice site at its 3-prime
end and causing splice-mediated insertion of an Alu fragment into the
mature OAT mRNA. Mitchell et al. (1991) found 3 other examples in which
a portion of an Alu element appeared to be spliced into the coding
region of a mature mRNA, but this appeared to be the first example of
association with hereditary disease. The other 2 mechanisms by which Alu
sequences play a role in human genetic disease are by providing sites
for homologous recombination that produce deletions and chromosomal
rearrangements and by de novo retroposition of an Alu sequence into
genes.

.0024
GYRATE ATROPHY OF CHOROID AND RETINA
OAT, ARG184THR

Michaud et al. (1992) used a modified method of single-strand
conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis for the detection of mutants
in gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina (258870) in a prospective
study of 24 previously uncharacterized mutant genes. The method found 13
different mutations accounting for 19 (79%) of the 24. In the SSCP
method, first described by Orita et al. (1989), DNA fragments are first
denatured and then electrophoresed under nondenaturing conditions,
allowing single strands of DNA to assume a secondary structure
determined by the nucleotide sequence. Sequence changes as small as a
single nucleotide substitution can alter the secondary structure and
allow resolution of wildtype and mutant strands. One of the new
mutations was a substitution of threonine for arginine-184 (R184T)
resulting from a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 550 of the OAT mRNA.

.0025
GYRATE ATROPHY OF CHOROID AND RETINA
OAT, PRO241LEU

Using SSCP analysis, Michaud et al. (1992) demonstrated a pro241-to-leu
(P241L) mutation resulting from a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 722 of
the OAT mRNA in a patient with gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina
(258870).

.0026
GYRATE ATROPHY OF CHOROID AND RETINA
OAT, ARG250PRO

Using SSCP analysis, Michaud et al. (1992) demonstrated a substitution
of proline for arginine-250 (R250P) resulting from a G-to-C transversion
at nucleotide 749 of the OAT mRNA in a patient with gyrate atrophy of
the choroid and retina (258870).

.0027
GYRATE ATROPHY OF CHOROID AND RETINA
OAT, GLY353ASP

Using SSCP analysis, Michaud et al. (1992) demonstrated a substitution
of aspartic acid for glycine-353 (G353D) resulting from a G-to-A
transition at nucleotide 1058 of the OAT mRNA in a patient with gyrate
atrophy of the choroid and retina (258870).

.0028
GYRATE ATROPHY OF CHOROID AND RETINA
OAT, TRP391TER

Using SSCP analysis, Michaud et al. (1992) demonstrated a G-to-A
transition at nucleotide 1171 of the OAT mRNA, converting tryptophan-391
to a stop codon (W391X) in a patient with gyrate atrophy of the choroid
and retina (258870).

.0029
GYRATE ATROPHY OF CHOROID AND RETINA
OAT, CYS394ARG

Using SSCP analysis, Michaud et al. (1992) demonstrated a T-to-C
transition at nucleotide 1180 of the OAT mRNA, converting cysteine-394
to arginine (C394R) in a patient with gyrate atrophy of the choroid and
retina (258870).

.0030
GYRATE ATROPHY OF CHOROID AND RETINA
OAT, GLY401TER

Using SSCP analysis, Michaud et al. (1992) demonstrated a G-to-T
transversion at nucleotide 1201 of the OAT mRNA, changing glycine-401 to
a stop codon (G401X) in a patient with gyrate atrophy of the choroid and
retina (258870).

.0031
GYRATE ATROPHY OF CHOROID AND RETINA
OAT, 1,072-BP DEL

Inana et al. (1988) found that a gyrate atrophy of the choroid and
retina (258870) patient had no detectable OAT mRNA and a truncated
5.0-kb OAT gene band in Southern blot analysis of EcoRI-digested genomic
DNA. The patient was heterozygous for the deletion inherited from the
father and transmitted to 2 of his children (Hotta et al., 1989). By
cloning and sequencing of the truncated gene fragment, Akaki et al.
(1992) demonstrated a 1,072-bp deletion including the entire exon 6,
starting in intron 5, 172 bp upstream of exon 6, and ending in intron 6,
772 bp downstream of exon 6. A short direct repeat sequence, AGGAGC,
resembling the sequence known to cause DNA polymerase alpha to pause,
and sequences capable of forming hairpin loops were both present at the
5-prime and 3-prime breakpoints of the deletion. The deletion resulted
in a reading frameshift and a premature termination codon at position
192. By PCR, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, and direct
sequencing, the other allele was shown also to have a premature
termination codon in exon 6. The absence of detectable OAT mRNA was
consistent with the compound heterozygosity for premature termination
mutations early in the coding sequence.

.0032
GYRATE ATROPHY OF CHOROID AND RETINA
OAT, TYR209TER

In patients with gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina (258870),
Mashima et al. (1992) identified 4 nonsense mutations in the OAT gene:
tyr209-to-ter (Y209X), tyr299-to-ter (613349.0033), arg426-to-ter
(613349.0034), and a deletion of 2 bp from codons 64 and 65, resulting
in frameshift and the generation of a stop codon at position 79
(613349.0035). They demonstrated that the stop codons at positions 79,
209, and 299 resulted in abnormally low levels of OAT mRNA in skin
fibroblasts, whereas the nonsense mutation at codon 426 in the last exon
had little effect on the mRNA level. The Y209X mutation resulted from a
T-to-A transition in exon 6 and was found in compound heterozygous state
with a deletion in the same exon (613349.0031).

.0033
GYRATE ATROPHY OF CHOROID AND RETINA
OAT, TYR299TER

See 613349.0032 and Mashima et al. (1992); the Y299X mutation resulted
from a C-to-G transversion in exon 8 and was found in compound
heterozygous state with an R180T substitution (613449.0008).

.0034
GYRATE ATROPHY OF CHOROID AND RETINA
OAT, ARG426TER

See 613349.0032 and Mashima et al. (1992); the R426X mutation resulted
from a homozygous C-to-T transition in exon 11.

.0035
GYRATE ATROPHY OF CHOROID AND RETINA
OAT, 2-BP DEL, CODONS 64-65

See 613349.0032 and Mashima et al. (1992); the 2-bp deletion (AG) at
codons 64 and 65 resulted in a frameshift and a premature termination at
codon 79 in exon 4. The deletion was found in compound heterozygous
state with a P199N substitution (613349.0040).

.0036
GYRATE ATROPHY OF CHOROID AND RETINA
OAT, TRP178TER

Dietz et al. (1993) found deletion of exon 6 of the OAT gene in a
patient with gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina (258870). The
basis of the deletion was shown to be a nonsense mutation at codon 178
within the skipped exon. The patient was homozygous for a G-to-A
transition at position +13 of exon 6 (W178X). See 613349.0031 for
another example of skipping of exon 6 in a patient with gyrate atrophy
of the choroid and retina.

.0037
GYRATE ATROPHY OF CHOROID AND RETINA
OAT, TRP275TER

In a patient (GA003) with gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina
(258870), Dietz et al. (1993) found deletion of exon 8 resulting from a
nonsense mutation in the skipped exon. The patient was heterozygous for
a G-to-A transition at position +53 of exon 8, which resulted in
conversion of trp275 to a stop codon (W275X). This and the trp178-to-ter
mutation (613349.0036) joined a mutation in the fibrillin gene
(134797.0008) as examples of splicing errors resulting from nonsense
mutations.

.0038
GYRATE ATROPHY OF CHOROID AND RETINA WITH PYRIDOXINE-RESPONSIVE ORNITHINEMIA
OAT, ALA226VAL

In 2 unrelated patients with gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina
(258870), Michaud et al. (1995) found a missense mutation, A226V. One
patient, who was a compound heterozygous for A226V and for the premature
termination allele R398X, showed a significant decrease in mean plasma
ornithine levels following pyridoxine supplementation with a constant
protein intake. In extracts from fibroblasts of a second gyrate atrophy
of the choroid and retina patient homozygous for A226V and also from
Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing an OAT cDNA containing A226V,
Michaud et al. (1995) found that OAT activity increased from
undetectable levels to approximately 10% of normal when the
concentration of pyridoxal phosphate was increased from 50 to 600
microM. V332M (613349.0018) is another PLP-responsive gyrate atrophy
mutation. Two other proven pyridoxine-responsive mutations have been
found in the gene encoding erythroid-specific delta-aminolevulinate
synthetase in patients with X-linked sideroblastic anemia (301300.0001;
301300.0002).

.0039
GYRATE ATROPHY OF CHOROID AND RETINA
OAT, GLN90GLU

In examining the molecular mechanism of OAT deficiency causing gyrate
atrophy of the choroid and retina (258870) in a 35-year-old Japanese
male of consanguineous parents, Kobayashi et al. (1995) found evidence
of congenital enzyme mistargeting induced not by abnormalities in the
signal sequence but due to a substitution in the coding sequence of the
mature protein. A single base change from C to G at position 268 of
their cDNA resulted in an amino acid substitution of neutral gln (CAA)
by negatively charged glu (GAA) at position 90 (Q90E). Further studies
indicated that the patient's mutant OAT protein was located within the
limits of cytoplasmic free ribosomes in precursor form without any
mitochondrial entry, indicating that the patient's precursor OAT was
synthesized and rapidly degraded because of accumulation in the cytosol.
The findings suggested that not only the signal sequence but a critical
part of the mature sequence plays an essential role in mitochondrial
entry of the OAT precursor protein.

.0040
GYRATE ATROPHY OF CHOROID AND RETINA
OAT, PRO199GLN

In a patient with gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina (258870),
Mashima et al. (1992) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations
in the OAT gene: a 2-bp deletion in codons 64 and 65 (613349.0035) and a
C-to-A transversion in the second nucleotide in codon 199 in exon 6,
replacing pro with gln (P199N). The latter mutation was first identified
by Kaufman et al. (1990).

;;ILEAL DIPEPTIDYLPEPTIDASE;;
I100, RAT, HOMOLOG OF;;
NAALADase L
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Shneider et al. (1997) purified a novel ileal brush border membrane
protein, which they termed I100, by affinity chromatography. They used
polyclonal antibodies raised against this protein to clone and
characterize I100 in rats. They also identified a partial human I100
cDNA by hybridization screening. The rat I100 cDNA sequence encodes a
predicted 746-amino acid polypeptide with a single membrane-spanning
domain at the N terminus. The I100 protein is glycosylated and has a
core molecular weight of 80 kD. It has homology to folate hydrolase
(600934) and dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPP4; 102720). Immunofluorescent
staining revealed that the I100 protein is localized to the brush border
membrane of ileal villus enterocytes. Northern blot analysis of rat and
human tissues detected an approximately 2.6-kb mRNA in ileum, but not in
any other tissues.

By searching databases for sequences similar to NAALADase I (NAALAD1, or
FOLH1; 600934), followed by PCR and 5-prime RACE of a human small
intestine cDNA library, Pangalos et al. (1999) cloned NAALADL1. The
deduced 740-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 80.6
kD. NAALADL1 contains an N-terminal transmembrane domain, 2 putative
catalytic domains, and 7 potential N-glycosylation sites. The first
catalytic domain is similar to bacterial and yeast Zn(2+)-dependent
peptidase domains, and the second is related to members of the
alpha/beta-hydrolase fold family of proteins. NAALADL1 shares 35% and
37% amino acid identity with NAALADase I and NAALADase II (NAALAD2;
611636), respectively. Several NAALADL1 splice variants were also
identified in small intestine, colon, and adult and fetal brain cDNA
libraries. RT-PCR detected variable NAALADL1 expression, with highest
levels in small intestine, spleen, and testis, and lowest levels in
brain and muscle. NAALADL1 was also expressed in some subregions of
adult brain.

GENE FUNCTION

Shneider et al. (1997) found that cells transfected with rat I100 cDNA
had peptidase activity on a gly-pro dipeptide.

By assaying cellular homogenates of transfected COS cells, Pangalos et
al. (1999) showed that human NAALADL1 had DPP4-like activity against a
synthetic peptide, but it lacked NAALADase activity against radiolabeled
N-acetyl-L-aspartyl-L-glutamate.

MAPPING

By FISH, Pangalos et al. (1999) mapped the NAALADL1 gene to chromosome
11q12.

613114	TITLE *613114 FAMILY WITH SEQUENCE SIMILARITY 134, MEMBER B; FAM134B
;;JK1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching a region of chromosome 5p amplified in esophageal squamous
cell carcinoma (ESCC; see 133239) in a Chinese population, Tang et al.
(2007) identified FAM134B, which they called JK1. The deduced 39.3-kD
protein has an EGF (131530)-like domain, 3 N-glycosylation sites, 3
N-myristoylation sites, and numerous possible phosphorylation sites.

Kurth et al. (2009) stated that the human FAM134B protein contains 497
amino acids. Structure analysis showed that the N-terminal half of
FAM134B has 2 unusually long hydrophobic segments of about 35 amino
acids each that are separated by a hydrophilic loop of about 60 amino
acids. This structure is similar to that of reticulon proteins (see
600865) that shape the curvature of endoplasmic reticulum membranes. The
C terminus of FAM134B contains a coiled-coil domain. Northern blot
analysis of adult mouse tissues detected at least 4 Fam134b transcripts.
High expression of an approximately 1.5-kb transcript was detected in
testis only. Transcripts of about 3.5 kb were more weakly expressed in
dorsal root ganglia, esophagus, skeletal muscle, and kidney, and many
other tissues showed much weaker Fam134b expression. In situ
hybridization of day-14.5 mouse embryos showed prominent staining of
sensory and autonomic ganglia. In cultured mouse dorsal root ganglia,
Fam134b colocalized with a cis-Golgi marker and partly colocalized with
a trans-Golgi marker.

GENE FUNCTION

Using multiplex RT-PCR, Tang et al. (2007) found that JK1 was
overexpressed in a significant number of ESCC cell lines and tumors
compared with normal esophageal cells and tissues. Overexpression of JK1
in NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts and HEK293 cells caused an increase in
growth rate, colony formation in soft agar, and foci formation in
confluent cultures. High-grade sarcomas were formed in athymic nude mice
following subcutaneous injection of JK1-overexpressing NIH-3T3 cells.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Tang et al. (2007) mapped the FAM134B gene
to chromosome 5p15.1, downstream of the delta-catenin gene (CTNND2;
604275).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 4 unrelated families with hereditary sensory and
autonomic neuropathy type IIB (HSAN2B; 613115), Kurth et al. (2009)
identified 4 different homozygous truncating loss-of-function mutations
in the FAM134B gene (613114.0001-613114.0004).

164873	TITLE *164873 ETS VARIANT GENE 3; ETV3
;;ONCOGENE PE1; PE1;;
MITOGENIC ETS TRANSCRIPTIONAL SUPPRESSOR; METS
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The ETS oncogene (164720) was first described as part of a fusion gene
transduced by the avian retrovirus E26. In E26, v-ets and v-myb (189990)
were fused to a portion of GAG to form the transforming gene. The ETS
oncogene family shares a conserved peptide motif called the ETS domain
that mediates sequence-specific DNA binding. This motif is unique among
transcription factor families. Using partially degenerate
oligonucleotides from conserved regions of the ETS domain and the
polymerase chain reaction, Klemsz et al. (1994) isolated a new member of
the ETS family, designated PE1, from HL60 cells. The PE1 gene was
expressed as an approximately 5-kb transcript in most cell lines tested.

GENE FUNCTION

Klappacher et al. (2002) described a mechanism in which induction of the
ETS repressor METS links terminal differentiation to cell cycle arrest.
Using macrophages as a model, they provided evidence that METS blocks
RAS (190020)-dependent proliferation without inhibiting RAS-dependent
expression of cell type-specific genes by selectively replacing ETS
activators on the promoters of cell cycle control genes. The
antiproliferative effects of METS required its interaction with DP103
(DDX20; 606168), a DEAD box-containing protein that assembles a novel
corepressor complex. Functional interactions between the METS/DP103
complex and E2F (see 189971)/RB1 (614041) family proteins were also
necessary for inhibition of cellular proliferation, suggesting a
combinatorial code that directs permanent cell cycle exit during
terminal differentiation.

MAPPING

Using both in situ hybridization and study of human/hamster cell
hybrids, Klemsz et al. (1994) demonstrated that the PE1 gene is located
on 1q21-q23.

603320	TITLE *603320 MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASE 23A; MMP23A
;;MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASE 21, FORMERLY; MMP21, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The matrix metalloproteinases are secreted glycoproteins that are
involved in the remodeling of the extracellular matrix. By analysis of
the genomic region surrounding the duplicated genes CDC2L1 (176873) and
CDC2L2 (116951), Gururajan et al. (1998) identified 2 novel matrix
metalloproteinase genes, MMP23A, which they called MMP21, and MMP23B
(603321), which they called MMP22. The nucleotide sequences of MMP21 and
MMP22 are nearly identical. Using a combination of techniques, the
authors isolated cDNAs corresponding to alternatively spliced
transcripts that encode 3 protein isoforms, MMP21/22A, MMP21/22B, and
MMP21/22C. The MMP21 and MMP22 proteins contain prepro-, catalytic,
cysteine-rich, IL1R (147810)-related, and proline-rich domains. Northern
blot analysis revealed that a 1.4-kb MMP21/22 transcript was expressed
in heart, placenta, ovary, testis, and prostate. A 0.8-kb mRNA was
detected in heart and pancreas, and an additional 2.4-kb mRNA was
detected in ovary.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gururajan et al. (1998) determined that the MMP21 and MMP22 genes
contain 8 exons each, and the exons generally correspond to the
structural domains of the putative protein products.

MAPPING

Gururajan et al. (1998) reported that the MMP21 and MMP22 genes are
located within an approximately 140-kb region on chromosome 1p36.3. This
region consists of 2 identical genomic segments, each of which contains
a CDC2L gene linked to an MMP gene. The 3-prime end of the MMP gene is
500 to 800 bp from the 3-prime end of the adjacent CDC2L gene. The genes
are arranged in the order
telomere--MMP22--CDC2L2--CDC2L1--MMP21--centromere. The 2 CDC2L genes
are separated by approximately 50 kb. Gururajan et al. (1998) stated
that although the functional significance of the reiteration of selected
genes within the 1p36.3 region is not known, it might reflect
instability relevant to the observed deletion of 1p36 during
tumorigenesis.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The FLVCR2 gene encodes a transmembrane protein that belongs to the
major facilitator superfamily of secondary carriers that transport small
solutes in response to chemiosmotic ion gradients, such as calcium
(summary by Meyer et al., 2010).

CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to FLVCR1 (609144),
Lipovich et al. (2002) identified FLVCR2, which they called FLVCRL14q.
The deduced 527-amino acid protein contains 12 transmembrane domains and
the N- and C-terminal domains are cytoplasmic. A splice variant, in
which exon 1 is directly spliced to exon 9, encodes a putative 83-amino
acid protein that lacks all transmembrane domains.

Brasier et al. (2004) used a rat cDNA for a calcitonin (114130)-like
receptor to design 5-prime and 3-prime RACE primers, and they cloned 4
CCT transcripts from a human pituitary cDNA library. All transcripts
encode a deduced 526-amino acid protein that has an N-terminal hexad
repeat, 6 extracellular loops, and a C-terminal polyglutamate sequence.
EST analysis detected CCT in brain, heart, kidney, lung, placenta,
uterus, cervix, prostate, testis, germ cells, and whole fetus.
Immunofluorescence analysis of human pituitary detected CCT
predominantly in acidophils. Brasier et al. (2004) also identified 3 Cct
transcripts in mouse, which encode a deduced 551-amino acid protein. In
developing rat, Cct expression was restricted to osteoclasts,
chondrocytes, thyroid, pituitary, central nervous system, eye, liver,
kidney, and heart, and in mouse, intraplacental yolk sac showed Cct
expression. In mouse and rat kidney, Cct was expressed in the distal
portions of nephrons and collecting ducts.

By searching a database for sequences similar to FLVCR1, followed by PCR
of a rhabdomyosarcoma cell line cDNA library, Brown et al. (2006) cloned
FLVCR2, which encodes a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 60
kD. It has 3 potential N-glycosylation motifs. Western blot analysis
detected FLVCR2 proteins at 55 kD and 40 kD. However, N-glycosidase
treatment did not alter the molecular mass of the larger protein.

Using quantitative real-time PCR, Duffy et al. (2010) detected variable
FLVCR2 expression in all human tissues examined, with highest expression
in placenta, followed by adult and fetal liver.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lipovich et al. (2002) determined that the FLVCR2 gene contains 10
exons. The transcription start site is within a predicted CpG island,
and there are 2 polyadenylation signals at the 3-prime end.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Brasier et al. (2004) mapped the FLVCR2
gene to chromosome 14q24.3. They mapped the mouse Flvcr2 gene to
chromosome 12.

EVOLUTION

Lipovich et al. (2002) identified genes, including the FLVCR1-FLVCR2
paralogs, involved in a chromosome 1q/14q block duplication.
Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the duplication occurred early
within or immediately prior to the divergence of the vertebrate lineage,
between the protostome-deuterostome and amniote-amphibian divergences.

GENE FUNCTION

Infection of cells by the highly anemogenic feline leukemia virus
subgroup C (FeLV-C) is mediated by the binding of FeLV-C envelope
protein to FLVCR1. By assaying transfected mouse cells, Brown et al.
(2006) determined that, unlike FLVCR1, FLVCR2 does not bind FeLV-C
envelope protein. However, an asn463-to-asp mutation rendered FLVCR2
functional as an FeLV-C receptor.

Duffy et al. (2010) found that both human FLVCR1 and FLVCR2 bound
immobilized heme. Using hamster or human cell lines and Xenopus oocytes,
they confirmed that overexpression of human FLVCR1 resulted in heme
export, but in contrast, overexpression of FLVCR2 resulted in heme
import. Overexpression of FLVCR2 also rendered transfected cells more
sensitive to heme toxicity. Downregulation of FLVCR2 via small
interfering RNA inhibited heme import. Duffy et al. (2010) concluded
that FLVCR2 functions in heme import.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By genomewide linkage analysis, followed by candidate gene sequencing,
Meyer et al. (2010) identified a homozygous mutation in the FLVCR2 gene
(T430R; 610865.0001) in 5 fetuses with proliferative vasculopathy and
hydranencephaly-hydrocephaly syndrome (PVHH; 225790) from 3
consanguineous Pakistani families. The disorder is also known as Fowler
syndrome. Two additional fetuses of Northern European origin with the
disorder were each found to be compound heterozygous for 2 mutations in
the FLVCR2 gene (610865.0002-610865.0005). Meyer et al. (2010) suggested
that the disorder may involve defects in proliferation and motility of
vascular endothelial cells in the brain, which are calcium-dependent
events.

Using exome sequencing, Lalonde et al. (2010) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the FLVCR2 gene (610865.0006 and
610865.0007) in a fetus with proliferative vasculopathy and
hydranencephaly-hydrocephaly syndrome.

By genomewide linkage analysis followed by high-throughput sequencing of
7 families with Fowler syndrome, Thomas et al. (2010) identified
homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations affecting the FLVCR2 gene
(see, e.g., Y134X; 610865.0008). Two of the families, of Turkish origin,
carried a large deletion. The patients and families had previously been
reported by Bessieres-Grattagliano et al. (2009).

In 5 fetuses with proliferative vasculopathy and
hydranencephaly-hydrocephaly syndrome (PVHH; 225790) from 3
consanguineous Pakistani families, Meyer et al. (2010) identified a
homozygous 1289C-G transversion in exon 7 of the FLVCR2 gene, resulting
in a thr430-to-arg (T430R) substitution in a highly conserved region in
an intracellular loop of the protein. The mutation was not found in 646
control chromosomes.

In a fetus of Northern European origin with proliferative vasculopathy
and hydranencephaly-hydrocephaly syndrome (225790), Meyer et al. (2010)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the FLVCR2 gene: a
6-bp deletion (329_334del) in exon 1, and a 1192C-G transversion in exon
6, resulting in a leu398-to-val (L398V; 610865.0003) substitution. The
6-bp deletion removed 3 conserved amino acids (asn110 to phe 112) and
introduced an isoleucine residue in the predicted first extracellular
loop (Asn110_Phe112delinsIle). The L398V substitution occurred in a
highly conserved residue in close proximity to transmembrane domain-9
(TM9). Neither mutation was found in at least 936 control chromosomes.
Lalonde et al. (2010) identified the same compound heterozygous
mutations in a second affected fetus from the family reported by Meyer
et al. (2010).

In a fetus, born of French Canadian parents, with proliferative

et al. (2010) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
FLVCR2 gene: a 997C-T transition in exon 4, resulting in an
ala326-to-val (A326V) substitution at the end of the sixth transmembrane
domain (TM6), and a T-to-C transition in intron 7 (1341+2T-C;
610865.0007), predicted to result in the skipping of exon 7 or retention
of intron 7, disrupting the tenth transmembrane domain (TM10) and
potentially resulting in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The parents had
previously lost a fetus with a similar phenotype, but no DNA sample was
available for study.

Thomas et al. (2010) identified a homozygous 402C-G transversion in the
FLVCR2 gene, resulting in a tyr134-to-ter (Y134X) substitution in
transmembrane domain-2 (TM2). The sibs had macrocrania, limb
contractures, hydrocephlus, and thin cerebral walls with characteristic
encephaloclastic proliferative vasculopathy affecting both the brain and
spinal cord.

600301	TITLE *600301 ACYL-CoA DEHYDROGENASE, SHORT/BRANCHED CHAIN; ACADSB
;;SBCAD;;
2-@METHYLBUTYRYL-CoA DEHYDROGENASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (ACADs) are a group of mitochondrial enzymes
involved in the metabolism of fatty acids or branched-chain amino acids
(Rozen et al., 1994).

CLONING

Rozen et al. (1994) isolated and characterized a cDNA encoding the
precursor for a novel member of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase gene family.
The open reading frame of 1.3 kb encoded a precursor protein of 431
amino acids, which is processed in vitro to yield a mature protein of
399 amino acids. The cDNA had significant sequence similarity to other
members of the family, with the greatest homology (38%) to short-chain
acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (606885). The cDNA was expressed in eukaryotic
(COS) and prokaryotic (E. coli) cells, producing a protein of the
expected size with unique substrate specificities. The gene product had
the greatest activity toward the short/branched chain acyl-CoA
derivative, (S)-2-methylbutyryl-CoA, but also reacted significantly with
other 2-methyl-branched chain substrates and with short/straight chain
acyl-CoA. Because of the substrate specificity, they proposed the
designation short/branched chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase.

GENE STRUCTURE

Andresen et al. (2000) determined that the ACADSB gene contains 11
exons.

MAPPING

Arden et al. (1995) assigned the ACADSB gene to chromosome 10 by
hybridization to human/rodent somatic cell hybrid DNAs and localized the
gene to 10q25-q26 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a patient with isolated 2-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency
(610006), Andresen et al. (2000) identified a homozygous mutation in the
ACADSB gene (600301.0001), resulting in a 100-bp deletion. Enzyme assay
of the patient's fibroblasts, using 2-methylbutyryl-CoA as substrate,
confirmed the defect. Sequence analysis of candidate acyl-CoA
dehydrogenases revealed heterozygosity for the common short-chain ACAD
A625 variant allele and no mutations in ACAD8 (604773). The study showed
that ACAD8 is an isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase and that both wildtype
ACAD8 and ACADSB proteins are imported into mitochondria and form
tetramers.

In patients with isolated 2-methylbutyryl glycinuria due to ACADSB
deficiency, Gibson et al. (2000) and Madsen et al. (2006) identified
mutations in the ACADSB gene (600301.0002; 600301.0003).

Sass et al. (2008) reported 6 patients, including 2 sets of sibs, with
2-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency confirmed by genetic
analysis (T148I, 600301.0004 and E387K, 600301.0005). The patients were
of Turkish or Lebanese Arab origin. None of the patients had clinical
symptoms, and the 3 probands were all ascertained by newborn screening.
For the 3 probands, development was normal at age 3, 6, and 6 years,
respectively, even without treatment. In vitro studies of patient
fibroblasts confirmed an impairment in isoleucine degradation.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
2-@METHYLBUTYRYL-CoA DEHYDROGENASE DEFICIENCY
ACADSB, 1228G-A, EX10DEL

Andresen et al. (2000) identified homozygosity for a 1228G-A mutation in
the ACADSB gene, causing skipping of exon 10, in a patient with
methylbutyryl glycinuria (610006). The patient was a 3-year-old boy, the
son of first-cousin parents from Pakistan. During his second year of
life he became increasingly floppy, with retarded motor development,
generalized muscular atrophy, and strabismus. At age 3 years he was able
to walk with support. Although both parents and 2 sibs were
asymptomatic, the mother was shown also to excrete 2-methylbutyryl
glycine.

.0002
2-@METHYLBUTYRYL-CoA DEHYDROGENASE DEFICIENCY
ACADSB, LEU222PHE

In a male infant born of a northern European mother and Eritrean father,
Gibson et al. (2000) observed an isolated increase in 2-methylbutyryl
glycine and 2-methylbutyryl carnitine in blood and urine (610006). An
isolated block in 2-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase was demonstrated in
cultured fibroblasts. The DNA sequence of ACADSB contained a
heterozygous 768C-T substitution causing a leu222-to-phe (L222F) change
in the protein. Although pregnancy and birth were normal, the infant was
readmitted at age 3 days for poor feeding, lethargy, hypothermia,
hypoglycemia, and episodes of apnea. EEG and MRI of the brain showed
changes. A female fetus in a subsequent pregnancy was found to be
affected.

Madsen et al. (2006) found that the 2 sibs reported by Gibson et al.
(2000) were compound heterozygous for the L222F mutation and a splice
site mutation (600301.0003). Madsen et al. (2006) reported that the
L222F substitution resulted from a 763C-T transition.

.0003
2-@METHYLBUTYRYL-CoA DEHYDROGENASE DEFICIENCY
ACADSB, IVS3DS, A-G, +3

In a boy with 2-methylbutyryl glycinuria (610006), whose parents were
from Somalia, Madsen et al. (2006) identified a homozygous A-to-G
transition in intron 3 of the ACADSB gene, resulting in the skipping of
exon 3 as confirmed by mRNA analysis. The resultant mRNA likely leads to
nonsense-mediated decay, but any residual protein was predicted to lack
vital enzyme activity. Madsen et al. (2006) also identified the splice
site mutation in 2 affected sibs previously reported by Gibson et al.
(2000); see 600301.0002.

.0004
2-@METHYLBUTYRYL-CoA DEHYDROGENASE DEFICIENCY
ACADSB, THR148ILE

In 2 brothers, born of a consanguineous Arab couple from Lebanon, with
2-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (610006), Sass et al.
(2008) identified compound heterozygosity for mutation in the ACADSB
gene: a 443C-T transition in exon 4, resulting in a thr148-to-ile
(T148I) substitution, and the E387K mutation (600301.0005). One was
diagnosed via newborn screening, and the other was diagnosed at age 3
years after his brother's diagnosis. Neither patient showed any clinical
abnormalities, and both had normal development, but were lost to
follow-up when the proband was 10 months old. The authors also
identified homozygosity for the T148I mutation in 2 sibs from a
consanguineous Turkish family. Both boys had normal development at age 6
and 7 years, respectively. In vitro studies of patient fibroblasts
confirmed an impairment in isoleucine degradation.

.0005
2-@METHYLBUTYRYL-CoA DEHYDROGENASE DEFICIENCY
ACADSB, GLU387LYS

In a Turkish girl with 2-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency
(610006), Sass et al. (2008) identified a homozygous 1159G-A transition
in exon 10 of the ACADSB gene, resulting in a glu387-to-lys (E387K)
substitution. She showed normal development at age 3 years. The E387K
mutation was found in 2 of 146 Turkish control chromosomes and in 2 of
96 Lebanese control chromosomes, yielding an allelic frequency of about
2% in these populations. In vitro studies of patient fibroblasts
confirmed an impairment in isoleucine degradation.

125240	TITLE *125240 CD55 ANTIGEN; CD55
;;DECAY-ACCELERATING FACTOR FOR COMPLEMENT; DAF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The major isoform of DAF, or CD55, is a 70-kD plasma membrane protein
that is widely distributed on all blood cells and on endothelial and
epithelial tissues. The physiologic role of DAF is to inhibit the
complement cascade at the level of the critical C3 (120700) convertase
step. By this mechanism, DAF protects autologous cells and tissues from
complement-mediated damage and thereby plays a role in preventing or
modulating autoimmune disease and inflammation. DAF also serves as a
receptor for certain strains of E. coli and certain types of
enteroviruses. Variation in DAF forms the basis of the Cromer blood
group system (CROM; 613793) (review by Lublin, 2005). In addition to the
major membrane-bound isoform of DAF, several other minor soluble and
membrane-bound DAF isoforms are produced by alternative splicing (Osuka
et al., 2006)

CLONING

Avoidance by host tissues of attack by autologous complement proteins is
dependent in part on the activities of membrane regulatory factors. One
molecule involved in this control is a 70-kD glycoprotein termed
decay-accelerating factor (DAF). Interruption by DAF of the complement
sequence at an early step in activation effectively halts progression of
the cascade and prevents consequent cell injury. In man, a
glycolipid-anchored form of DAF is expressed on the plasma membrane of
all cell types that are in intimate contact with plasma complement
proteins. DAF is also found on the surfaces of epithelial cells lining
extracellular compartments, and variants of DAF are present in body
fluids and in extracellular matrix. Medof et al. (1987) cloned cDNAs for
human DAF. The deduced 376-amino acid protein contains a 29-amino acid
N-terminal leader peptide, followed by 4 approximately 61-amino acid
repeats of internal homology, a 70-amino acid serine- and threonine-rich
segment with multiple potential O-glycosylation sites, and a C-terminal
hydrophobic segment. However, the sequence lacks an initiation codon,
indicating it is incomplete. Northern blot analysis of HeLa cells and
myeloid leukemia cells detected transcripts of 3.1, 2.7, and 2.0 kb.

Osuka et al. (2006) noted that glycosylphosphatidylinositol
(GPI)-anchored DAF (gDAF) and soluble DAF (sDAF) are generated by
alternative splicing. Insertion of a unique exon (exon 10) into the sDAF
cDNA causes a frameshift that results in a unique C-terminal sequence
lacking the GPI-anchored portion of gDAF. By RT-PCR of a lung cDNA
library, Osuka et al. (2006) cloned 5 additional minor DAF variants.
Three of the variants, vDAF1, vDAF2, and vDAF3, include novel exons
(exons 11, 12, and 13, respectively) compared with gDAF and, like sDAF,
encode proteins lacking the GPI-anchored portion in the C terminus.
Variants vDAF4 and vDAF5 include part or all of intron 7, respectively,
and encode proteins that retain the GPI-anchored portion of the C
terminus but have expanded central STP-rich regions. PCR analysis
detected expression of the DAF variants in almost all tissues examined,
with higher expression of all variants in lung, liver, and peripheral
blood compared with colon and stomach. The main band was derived from
gDAF. Transfection of vDAF1, vDAF2, and vDAF3 into Chinese hamster ovary
cells resulted in the secretion of these isoforms into the culture
medium. Each was highly O-glycosylated prior to secretion. vDAF4 was
expressed as a highly O-glycosylated membrane-bound protein.

GENE FUNCTION

CD55 is deficient in red blood cells from patients with paroxysmal
nocturnal hemoglobinuria (300818). Hamann et al. (1996) found that CD55
is the cellular ligand for CD97 (601211). Erythrocytes from patients
with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria failed to adhere to cells
expressing CD97.

The placenta is an immunologically privileged site. Using DNA
microarrays to compare gene expression patterns, Sood et al. (2006)
found that 3 regulators of complement, CD55, CD59 (107271), and MCP, are
expressed at higher levels in normal placental villus sections compared
with other normal human tissues. Within the placenta, CD55 and CD59 are
expressed at greatest levels in amnion, followed by chorion and villus
sections, whereas MCP is expressed at higher levels only in villus
sections. These inhibitors of complement are expressed on
syncytiotrophoblasts, the specialized placental cells lining the villi
that are in direct contact with maternal blood. The amnion compared with
chorion is remarkably nonimmunogenic, and the immune properties of the
amnion are intriguing because it is not in direct contact with maternal
cells. Sood et al. (2006) suggested that the amnion may secrete the
complement inhibitors themselves or in the form of protected exosomes
into the amniotic fluid or the neighboring maternofetal junction.

Capasso et al. (2006) showed that stimulation of CD4 (186940) cells
through engagement of CD55, either with monoclonal antibodies or with
CD97, together with anti-CD3, led to enhanced T-cell proliferation,
cytokine production, and expression of activation markers. This
activation did not affect CD55-mediated complement inhibition and
suggested a novel role for CD55.

Using differential display PCR, Brandt et al. (2005) identified a CD55
splice variant that was overexpressed in a breast cancer cell line
displaying increased transendothelial invasiveness. In situ
hybridization of tissue microarrays and RT-PCR analysis showed the
splice variant was expressed in a proportion of invasive breast cancer
tissues but not in normal mammary tissue. Western blot analysis detected
the dominant full-length protein at an apparent molecular mass of 70 kD
and the isoform at about 45 kD. The isoform was detected in cytoplasm
and secreted into the culture medium.

Group B coxsackieviruses (CVBs) must cross the epithelium to initiate
infection. Coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR, or CXADR;
602621), which mediates attachment and infection by all CVBs, is a
component of the tight junction (TJ) and is inaccessible to virus
approaching from the apical surface. Using Caco2 human colorectal
carcinoma cells, Coyne and Bergelson (2006) showed that CVB attachment
to DAF on the apical cell surface activated ABL (189980), triggering
RAC1 (602048)-dependent actin rearrangements that permitted virus
movement to the TJ. Within the TJ, interaction with CAR promoted
conformational changes in the virus capsid that were essential for virus
entry and release of viral RNA. Interaction with DAF also activated FYN
(137025), which was required for phosphorylation of caveolin-1 (CAV1;
601047) and transport of the virus into the cell within caveolar
vesicles. Coyne and Bergelson (2006) concluded that CVBs exploit
DAF-mediated signaling pathways to surmount the epithelial barrier.

GENE STRUCTURE

Osuka et al. (2006) determined that the CD55 gene contains 14 exons.

MAPPING

Lublin et al. (1987) and Lemons et al. (1987) found by study of
hamster-human somatic cell hybrids with DAF cDNA clones and by in situ
hybridization using the same clones that the gene is located at 1q32.
Thus, DAF is closely linked to structural genes for 4 other complement
proteins, C4-binding protein (C4BPA; 120830), CR1 (120620), CR2
(120650), and factor H (CFH; 134370), with which it shares 60-amino acid
repeats as well as functional similarities. Their close genetic linkage
suggests that this complement regulatory gene family evolved from an
ancestral C3b-binding molecule.

Hourcade et al. (1992) described 9 overlapping YACs that encompassed a
genomic region of 800 kb, encoding 4 RCA (regulator of complement
activation) genes and 3 RCA-gene-like elements. An arrangement of CR1,
MCP-like, CR1-like, and MCP (120920), in that order, strongly suggested
that this region of 1q was generated by a single duplication of
neighboring CR1/CR1-like and MCP/MCP-like forerunners.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Cromer Blood Group System: Inab Phenotype

The Cromer Inab phenotype, or Cromer null, in which red blood cells lack
all Cromer system antigens, is very rare. The red blood cells of
individuals with Inab phenotype have a deficiency of DAF, but they are
not known to have any associated hematologic or other abnormalities. In
the individual in which the Inab phenotype was first detected, Lublin et
al. (1994) demonstrated a nonsense mutation in exon 2 of the DAF gene
(125240.0001). The mutation truncated DAF near the N terminus,
explaining the complete absence of surface DAF in the red cells of the
individual.

In a 28-year-old Japanese woman, Wang et al. (1998) demonstrated that
the Cromer Inab phenotype was due to homozygosity for a 1579C-A
transversion at the position 24 bp upstream of the 3-prime end of exon 2
of the CD55 gene (125240.0002). This substitution resulted in an mRNA
with a 26-bp deletion, which introduced a frameshift and created a stop
codon immediately downstream of the deletion. Translation of the mRNA
would be terminated at the first amino acid of the second short
consensus repeat (SCR2) domain of DAF. The woman and her brother, who
also had the Cromer-null phenotype, had no history of intestinal
disease.

ANIMAL MODEL

Lin et al. (2002) demonstrated enhanced susceptibility to experimental
autoimmune myasthenia gravis (254200) in mice lacking Daf. Following
anti-AChR Ab injection, Daf1 -/- mice (devoid of neuromuscular DAF
protein) showed dramatically greater muscle weakness than their Daf1 +/+
littermates. Reversal of the weakness by edrophonium was consistent with
a myasthenic disorder. Immunohistochemistry revealed greatly augmented
C3b deposition localized at postsynaptic junctions, and
radioimmunoassays showed more profound reductions in AChR levels.
Electron microscopy demonstrated markedly greater junctional damage in
the Daf1 -/- mice compared with the Daf1 +/+ littermates.

Liu et al. (2005) found that Daf -/- mice had significantly enhanced
T-cell responses after immunization. This phenotype was characterized by
hypersecretion of Ifng (147570) and Il2 (147680), as well as
downregulation of Il10 (124092) upon restimulation of lymphocytes in
vitro. Daf1 -/- mice also displayed exacerbated disease progression and
pathology in the T cell-dependent experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE) model. Both T-cell responses and EAE disease
severity could be attenuated by neutralization of the complement system.
Liu et al. (2005) concluded that there is a critical link between the
complement system and T-cell immunity and proposed that DAF may have a
role in organ transplantation and vaccine development.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CROMER BLOOD GROUP SYSTEM, Inab PHENOTYPE
CD55, TRP53TER

In the first individual discovered to have the Cromer Inab phenotype
(613793), i.e., absence of all Cromer system antigens on red blood
cells, Lublin et al. (1994) found a G-to-A transition, converting codon
53 in the CD55 gene from TGG (trp) to TGA (stop). The resulting
truncation near the amino terminus explained the complete absence of
surface DAF in the subject.

.0002
CROMER BLOOD GROUP SYSTEM, Inab PHENOTYPE
CD55, 26-BP DEL

In a 28-year-old Japanese woman, Wang et al. (1998) demonstrated that
the Cromer Inab phenotype (613793) was due to homozygosity for a 1579C-A
transversion at the position 24 bp upstream of the 3-prime end of exon 2
of the CD55 gene. This substitution caused the activation of a novel
cryptic splice site and resulted in the production of mRNA with a 26-bp
deletion. The deletion introduced a frameshift and created a stop codon
immediately downstream of the deletion. Translation of mRNA would be
terminated at the first amino acid residue of the second short consensus
repeat (SCR2) domain (exon 3) of DAF. The functional domains of DAF's
complement regulatory activity and the C-terminal signal domains for
glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchoring were predicted to be
lacking in the subject. The subject and her brother, who also had the
Cromer-null phenotype, had no history of intestinal disease.
