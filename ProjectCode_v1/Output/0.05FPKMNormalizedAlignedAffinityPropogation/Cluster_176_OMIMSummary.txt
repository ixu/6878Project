;;ABH6
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database analysis to identify sequences similar to ABH genes (see
ALKBH1; 605345), followed by PCR of a testis cDNA library, Tsujikawa et
al. (2007) cloned ALKBH6, which they called ABH6. Other than a short
N-terminal segment, the deduced 169-amino acid protein consists entirely
of an AlkB homology domain that is predicted to function as a
2-oxoglutarate- and Fe(II)-dependent oxygenase domain. Quantitative
real-time PCR detected variable ABH6 expression in all 16 tissues
examined, with highest expression in testis and pancreas.
Fluorescence-tagged ABH6 was expressed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus
of transfected HeLa cells.

MAPPING

Hartz (2010) mapped the ALKBH6 gene to chromosome 19q13.12 based on an
alignment of the ALKBH6 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC007601) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;CHROMOSOME 6 OPEN READING FRAME 32; C6ORF32;;
KIAA0386;;
PL48
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

C6ORF32 plays a role in myogenic differentiation and formation of
cellular filopodia (Yoon et al., 2007).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1997) cloned C6ORF32, which they designated
KIAA0386. The deduced protein has 1,068 amino acids. RT-PCR detected
moderate expression in thymus and weak expression in placenta and lung.

By subtractive hybridization between undifferentiated human term
cytotrophoblasts and differentiating cytotrophoblasts to identify genes
with increased expression during differentiation, Dakour et al. (1997)
cloned C6ORF32, which they called PL48. The 536-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 59.8 kD and contains a transmembrane
region, 2 glycosaminoglycan attachment sites, 4 N-linked glycosylation
sites, and numerous potential phosphorylation sites. Northern blot
analysis of spontaneously differentiating human cytotrophoblasts
detected 2.8-, 3.5-, and 4.8-kb transcripts at 2 hours with increased
expression over time of differentiation. PLA48 was not expressed in
undifferentiated myeloid leukemia cells, but expression increased
between 24 and 72 hours following DMSO-induced granulocytic lineage
differentiation. Dakour et al. (1997) concluded that PL48 acted as an
early response gene during spontaneous cytotrophoblast differentiation
but was induced later in the DMSO-induced granulocytic differentiation
pathway.

Yoon et al. (2007) cloned C6ORF32 by microarray analysis of genes with
increased expression during fetal myoblast differentiation, followed by
RT-PCR of human primary fetal muscle cells harvested 5 days after
differentiation. C6ORF32 can encode 12 putative alternatively spliced
forms. They identified 2 isoforms, which they called Iso1 and Iso2. Iso1
contains 1,018 amino acids, and Iso2 contains 591 amino acids, including
an N-terminal extension of 55 amino acids compared to the PL48 species
identified by Dakour et al. (1997). Immunofluorescence studies localized
C6ORF32 to the cell membrane, cytoskeleton, and long cellular filopodia
in primary human fetal skeletal muscle cells, and to the cytoplasm in
cells undergoing mitosis. C6ORF32 was expressed in mononuclear cells,
not in myotubes, upon induction of differentiation and cellular fusion,
and expression was upregulated during human myoblast differentiation at
both the mRNA and protein levels.

GENE FUNCTION

Yoon et al. (2007) found that RNAi knockdown of mouse C6orf32 during
murine myoblast differentiation caused decreased cell fusion and severe
reduction of myotube formation, characterized by decreased myogenin
(MYOG; 159980) and myosin heavy chain (see 160730) expression and
unaltered MyoD1 (159970) expression. The authors suggested that C6orf32
may play a role in early myogenic differentiation and that the decreased
muscle cell fusion may be a secondary effect of impaired or slowed
differentiation caused by C6orf32 depletion. Overexpression of mouse
C6orf32 Iso2 or Iso1 in murine myoblasts and human embryonic kidney
cells induced formation of long filopodia. Transfection of mutant
constructs showed that N-terminal amino acids 55 to 113 of C6ORF32 are
likely to mediate filopodia formation.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1997) mapped the C6ORF32
gene to chromosome 6.

313440	TITLE *313440 SYNAPSIN I; SYN1
;;BRAIN PROTEIN 4.1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The SYN1 gene encodes synapsin I, a neuronal phosphoprotein associated
with the membranes of small synaptic vesicles. Synapsins may play a role
in synaptic neurotransmission, neuronal development, synaptogenesis,
maintenance of mature synapses, and plasticity (summary by Fassio et
al., 2011).

Also known as brain protein 4.1, synapsin I is the best characterized of
the nonerythroid forms of protein 4.1.

CLONING

Sudhof (1990) determined that differential splicing of the primary SYN1
transcript generates 2 separate forms of synapsin I.

Klagges et al. (1996) cloned the Drosophila synapsin gene (Syn), which
encodes 2 proteins, both of which contain a region with 50% amino acid
identity with the human protein. The Drosophila Syn gene contains 2 open
reading frames, separated by a single amber (UAG) stop codon. The
authors suggested that the large synapsin isoform in Drosophila may be
generated by UAG read-through, an unconventional mechanism for the
generation of protein diversity from a single gene.

GENE FUNCTION

Giovedi et al. (2004) found that interaction between mammalian synapsin
I and Rab3a (179490) regulated the activities of both proteins. Synapsin
I stimulated the Rab3a cycle by increasing GTP binding, GTPase activity,
and Rab3a recruitment to the synaptic vesicle membrane. Conversely,
Rab3a inhibited synapsin I binding to actin and synapsin I-induced
synaptic vesicle clustering.

The D-domain of Syn1 is a multifunctional domain that associates with
synaptic vesicles, regulates presynaptic targeting, binds SH3 domains of
interacting proteins, and contains phosphorylation sites that regulate
synaptic vesicle trafficking (summary by Fassio et al., 2011).

GENE STRUCTURE

Sudhof (1990) reported that synapsin I is encoded by a single-copy gene
containing 13 exons ranging in size from 58 bp to more than 1 kb. The
exons are nonuniformly distributed over more than 30 kb of DNA.

Derry and Barnard (1991) demonstrated that the gene for tissue inhibitor
of metalloproteinase (TIMP; 305370) is located within an intron of the
SYN1 gene in both mouse and man. The TIMP gene is transcribed in the
opposite direction to the SYN1 gene.

MAPPING

Yang-Feng et al. (1986) assigned the SYN1 gene to Xp11 by in situ
hybridization using a rat cDNA probe. Southern blot analysis of
human/Chinese hamster somatic cell hybrids carrying defined regions of
the human X chromosome confirmed the in situ mapping data. They also
determined the regional assignment in the mouse X chromosome. Yang-Feng
et al. (1986) hypothesized that the SYN1 gene may be mutant in human
X-linked disorders with primary neuronal degeneration, such as Rett
syndrome (312750). According to the evidence presented by Amar et al.
(1988), the mouse homolog, Syn1, is situated between Otc and Araf.

By detailed restriction mapping, Derry and Barnard (1992) demonstrated
that the 5-prime end of the SYN1 gene lies within 5 kb of the properdin
gene (PFC; 300383).

By in situ hybridization studies, Klagges et al. (1996) mapped the
Drosophila Syn gene to a single site in the region 86A on the right arm
of chromosome 3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of a family with epilepsy and variable learning
disabilities and behavior disorders (300491), Garcia et al. (2004)
identified a trp356-to-ter mutation (313440.0001) in the SYN1 gene.

In 6 males from a large French Canadian family with X-linked partial
epilepsy and learning disabilities, Fassio et al. (2011) identified a
truncating mutation in the SYN1 gene (Q555X; 313440.0002). Two of the
mutation carriers had autism. Investigation of this gene in several
large cohorts of patients with epilepsy and/or autism identified 3
additional variants in the SYN1 gene (see, e.g., 313440.0003 and
313440.0004) in 1% of patients with autism spectrum disorders and 3.5%
of patients with epilepsy. Three of the 4 mutations affected the
D-domain, which is important for protein function. When expressed in
Syn1-null neurons, these 3 mutant proteins were unable to rescue
impairments in the size and trafficking of synaptic vesicle pools. The
findings demonstrated that SYN1 is a predisposing gene to epilepsy and
autism spectrum disorders and strengthened the hypothesis that a
disturbance of synaptic homeostasis underlies the pathogenesis of both
disorders.

ANIMAL MODEL

Synapsin I had been thought to regulate synaptogenesis and
neurotransmitter release from adult nerve terminals. To examine this
possibility, Chin et al. (1995) generated synapsin I-deficient mice by
homologous recombination. They found that outgrowth of predendritic
neurites and of axons was severely retarded in the hippocampal neurons
of embryonic synapsin I mutant mice. Furthermore, synapse formation was
significantly delayed in these mutant neurons. The results indicated to
the authors that synapsin I, indeed, plays a role in regulation of
axonogenesis and synaptogenesis. In these same mice, Li et al. (1995)
found that the organization of synaptic vesicles at presynaptic
terminals was markedly altered: densely packed vesicles were present
only in a narrow rim at active zones, whereas most vesicles were
dispersed throughout the terminal area. This was in contrast to the
organized vesicle clusters present in terminals of wildtype animals.
Release of glutamate from nerve endings, induced by potassium ion,
4-aminopyridine, or a Ca(2+) ionophore, was markedly decreased in
synapsin I mutant mice. Recovery of synaptic transmission after
depletion of neurotransmitter by high-frequency stimulation was greatly
delayed. Finally, synapsin I-deficient mice exhibited a strikingly
increased response to electrical stimulation, as measured by
electrographic and behavioral seizures. The results indicated to the
authors that synapsin I plays a key role in the regulation of nerve
terminal function in mature synapses, as well as a function in neuronal
development as found by Chin et al. (1995).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001

DISORDERS
SYN1, TRP356TER

In affected members of a family with epilepsy and variable learning
disabilities and behavior disorders (300491), Garcia et al. (2004)
identified a 1197G-A transition in exon 9 of the SYN1 gene, resulting in
a trp356-to-ter (W356X) mutation. The mutation was also present in
obligate carrier females.

.0002
EPILEPSY, X-LINKED, WITH VARIABLE LEARNING DISABILITIES AND BEHAVIOR
DISORDERS
SYN1, GLN555TER

In 6 male members of a large French Canadian family with X-linked
partial epilepsy with variable learning disabilities and behavioral
disorders (300491), including autism, Fassio et al. (2011) identified a
gln555-to-ter (Q555X) substitution in exon 12 of the SYN1 gene. The
mutation, which was found by linkage analysis followed by candidate gene
sequencing, was not found in 418 control chromosomes. In vitro
functional expression assays showed that the mutation virtually
abolished the DE-domain binding to synaptic vesicles. The mutation also
abolished or dramatically reduced phosphorylation of the protein and
abolished binding to the SH3 domains of interacting proteins. Expression
of the mutant protein in Syn1-null hippocampal cells caused impaired
axonal elongation and impaired synaptic trafficking by decreasing
release of synaptic vesicles, particularly from the readily releasable
pool. These findings were consistent with a complete loss of function.

Using lentivirus-infected mouse hippocampal neurons, Lignani et al.
(2013) found that the human Q555X mutation interfered with the ability
of SYN1 to interact with mouse Syn2 (600755) isoforms and altered the
subcellular distribution of SYN1 compared with wildtype SYN1. The Q555X
mutation impaired synchronous coupling of synaptic vesicles to vesicle
release machinery, reduced the probability of vesicle release in
excitatory synapses, and decreased the pool of readily releasable
vesicles in inhibitory synapses. The net effect was an
excitatory/inhibitory imbalance with network hyperexcitability.

.0003
EPILEPSY, X-LINKED, WITH VARIABLE LEARNING DISABILITIES AND BEHAVIOR
DISORDERS
SYN1, ALA550THR

In 4 unrelated patients, 2 males and 2 females, with partial epilepsy
and/or autism spectrum disorders (300491), Fassio et al. (2011)
identified a hemizygous or heterozygous 1648G-A transition in exon 12 of
the SYN1 gene, resulting in an ala55-to-thr (A550T) substitution in the
D-domain of the protein. The mutation was not found in 709 control
chromosomes. All of the patients were of French-Canadian origin, and
haplotype analysis indicated a founder effect. In vitro functional
expression assays showed that the mutation impaired normal synaptic
vesicle trafficking in mouse hippocampal cells lacking the Syn1 gene.
There was impaired release of vesicles from the reserve and readily
releasable pools, consistent with a loss of function. The mutant protein
did not properly localize to the presynapse. The mutation did not affect
phosphorylation of the SYN1 protein or binding to SH3 domains of other
proteins.

.0004
EPILEPSY, X-LINKED, WITH VARIABLE LEARNING DISABILITIES AND BEHAVIOR
DISORDERS
SYN1, THR567ALA

In 2 unrelated males with autism spectrum disorders (see 300491), Fassio
et al. (2011) identified a 1699A-C transversion in exon 12 of the SYN1
gene, resulting in a thr567-to-ala (T567A) substitution in the D-domain
of the protein. The mutation was not found in 709 control chromosomes.
In vitro functional expression assays showed that the mutation impaired
normal synaptic vesicle trafficking in mouse hippocampal cells lacking
the Syn1 gene. There was impaired release of vesicles from the reserve
and readily releasable pools, consistent with a loss of function. The
mutant T567A protein did not properly localize to the presynapse. One of
the patients also carried an ala51-to-glu (A51G) substitution in the
SYN1 gene on the same allele, which may have caused an effect on protein
function, but functional studies were not performed on the A51G variant.
The T567A mutation did not affect phosphorylation of the SYN1 protein or
binding to SH3 domains of other proteins.

172480	TITLE *172480 PHOSPHOSERINE PHOSPHATASE; PSPH
;;PSP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Phosphoserine phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.3) fills an important role in the
biosynthesis of serine from carbohydrates by catalyzing the last step,
hydrolysis of O-phosphoserine.

CLONING

By starch gel electrophoresis, Moro-Furlani et al. (1980) detected
multiple isozymes of PSP in a wide range of tissues. They suggested that
rare electrophoretic variants were probably due to allelic variation at
the structural locus, and that common variation existed due to secondary
modification. The 3-banded isozyme pattern seen in heterozygotes (PSP2-1
and PSP3-1) suggested that PSP is dimeric.

Collet et al. (1997) cloned the human PSP cDNA, which encodes a
225-amino acid polypeptide. The cDNA was expressed and yielded a 25-kD
protein with the expected phosphatase activity.

MAPPING

By study of somatic cell hybrids, Koch et al. (1983) assigned the
structural gene for PSPH to chromosome 7 in the region pter-q22. By
study of patients with structural abnormalities of 7p, Novelli and
Dallapiccola (1988) refined the assignment of PSPH to 7p15.2-p15.1. The
activity of PSP was increased in a patient with an unbalanced
translocation associated with trisomy of the segment 7pter-p15 (Caiulo
et al., 1989).

Jaeken et al. (1997) noted that the assignments of the PSPH gene to 7p
by Koch et al. (1983) and Novelli and Dallapiccola (1988) were based on
gene dosage analysis. By genomic sequence analysis, Veiga-da-Cunha et
al. (2004) found that the PSPH gene is located on 7p11.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In the only known patient with phosphoserine phosphatase deficiency
(614023), who was reported by Jaeken et al. (1997), Veiga-da-Cunha et
al. (2004) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
PSPH gene (172480.0001; 172480.0002). They noted that the PSPH gene is
separated from the elastin gene (130160), one of several genes
implicated in Williams syndrome, by 16.5 Mbp. The authors concluded
there was no link between the 2 disorders in this patient.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PHOSPHOSERINE PHOSPHATASE DEFICIENCY
PSPH, ASP32ASN

In a patient with phosphoserine phosphatase deficiency (614023)
originally reported by Jaeken et al. (1997), Veiga-da-Cunha et al.
(2004) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the PSPH
gene: a 94G-A transition resulting in an asp32-to-asn (D32N)
substitution, and a 155T-C transition resulting in a met52-to-thr (M52T;
172480.0002) substitution. The D32N change occurs in a fairly
well-conserved region of the protein, and the M52T change in an
extremely well-conserved area. The patient's father and mother were
heterozygous for the D32N and the M52T mutation, respectively,
indicating autosomal recessive inheritance. In vitro expression studies
showed that the D32N mutation reduced enzyme activity by 50%, and the
M52T mutation virtually abolished enzyme activity. The changes were
consistent with kinetic properties observed in the patient's
fibroblasts.

library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned TRIM2, which they designated
KIAA0517. The transcript contains a repetitive element in its 3-prime
end. The deduced 792-amino acid protein had an apparent molecular mass
of 84 kD by SDS-PAGE. It shares weak similarity with mouse Tif1 (TRIM24;
603406). RT-PCR detected highest TRIM2 expression in human kidney,
followed by brain, ovary, and small intestine, with little to no
expression detected in other tissues examined.

Reymond et al. (2001) cloned mouse Trim2. The deduced protein contains
an N-terminal RING domain, followed by a B-box-2 domain, a coiled-coil
region, and 6 C-terminal NHL repeats. Northern blot analysis of human
tissues detected a 7.5-kb transcript in adult brain, kidney, pancreas,
and spleen. RNA in situ hybridization of embryonic mouse revealed
expression in central nervous system, gut, retina, lung, and kidney.
Mouse Trim2 was expressed in a filamentous cytoplasmic pattern in
transfected human cells.

Using in situ hybridization and histochemical staining of mouse nervous
system, Balastik et al. (2008) detected Trim2 expression in Purkinje
cells and deep nuclei of cerebellum; in ganglionic cell layer, inner
nuclear layer, and outer plexiform layer of retina; in pyramidal cells
of CA1 to CA3 hippocampal areas; in granule cells of dentate gyrus; and
in stratum radiatum. Trim2 was also expressed in spinal cord, dorsal
root ganglia, hindbrain, and midbrain.

GENE FUNCTION

Using in vitro-translated proteins, Balastik et al. (2008) showed that
mouse Trim2 functioned as a ubiquitin ligase, using Ubch5a (UBE2D1;
602961) as a ubiquitin-conjugating (E2) enzyme in an autoubiquitination
reaction. Trim2 interacted with Nfl (NEFL; 162280) from mouse brain
lysates, and deletion of the NHL repeats of Trim2 abolished the
interaction. A ligase-dead Trim2 mutant had a dominant-negative effect
on Nfl ubiquitination.

A brief period of ischemia is accompanied by phosphorylation,
ubiquitination, and degradation of the cell death-promoting protein BIM
(BCL2L11; 603827), and this response protects neurons from subsequent
harmful ischemic challenge. Using primary rat cortical neurons subjected
to oxygen and glucose deprivation to model ischemia, Thompson et al.
(2011) identified Trim2 as the E3 ubiquitin ligase that promoted
ubiquitination and degradation of Bim following a preconditioning
ischemic episode. Human TRIM2 interacted with Bim in a cell-free
expression system, and the interaction depended upon p42 (MAPK1;
176948)/p44 (MAPK3; 601795)-mediated Bim serine phosphorylation.
Preconditioning-induced Bim degradation was blocked by proteasome
inhibition or knockdown of Trim2 via small hairpin RNA or
immunodepletion. Thompson et al. (2011) concluded that TRIM2 controls
the apoptotic response to ischemia by directing degradation of BIM
protein.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the TRIM2
gene to chromosome 4. Reymond et al. (2001) mapped the TRIM2 gene to
chromosome 4q27-q34 by radiation hybrid analysis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a Finnish girl with autosomal recessive early-onset
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2R (CMT2R; 615490), Ylikallio et al.
(2013) identified compound heterozygous mutations in the TRIM2 gene
(614141.0001 and 614141.0002). The mutations were found by whole-exome
sequencing and segregated with the disorder in the family. The patient
had onset in early childhood of muscle weakness and atrophy affecting
the upper and lower distal extremities. She showed delayed onset of
walking and walked with a broad-based gait. She also had areflexia, pes
cavus, and decreased motor nerve conduction velocities. Sural nerve
biopsy was consistent with nonspecific axonal degeneration, and axons
showed abnormal accumulation of neurofilaments. Study of patient
fibroblasts showed significant deficiency of the TRIM2 protein,
consistent with a loss of function. Ylikallio et al. (2013) noted that
the neurofilament light chain is a ubiquitination target of TRIM2, and
suggested that abnormal axonal accumulation of neurofilaments underlies
the disorder. In addition, Trim2-null mice show a gait ataxia and
neurodegeneration accompanied by axonal swelling and development of
neurofilament aggregates, suggestive of impaired axonal transport. No
TRIM2 mutations were identified in a cohort of 87 patients with
early-onset CMT, indicating that mutations in this gene are a rare cause
of the disorder.

ANIMAL MODEL

Balastik et al. (2008) found that Trim -/- mice were indistinguishable
from wildtype and heterozygous littermates until about 1.5 months of
age, when they began to show intention tremor, followed by gait ataxia.
In later stages, Trim -/- mice suffered from episodes of spontaneous
generalized seizures. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed substantial
and progressive loss of Purkinje cells beginning at about postnatal day
50, with 85% loss of Purkinje cells by 5 months of age. Deep cerebellar
nuclei showed a similar progressive neurodegeneration. Caspase-3 (CASP3;
600636) immunoreactivity suggested that loss of Purkinje cells was due
to apoptosis. At 4 months of age, retinas of Trim -/- mice showed
reductions in inner nuclear layer, outer plexiform layer, and ganglionic
cells, whereas the photoreceptor layer was not altered.
Neurodegeneration in Trim2 -/- mice was accompanied by axonal swelling
and development of Nfl aggregates, suggestive of impaired axonal
transport.

In an 18-year-old Finnish girl with autosomal recessive early-onset
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2R (CMT2R; 615490), Ylikallio et al.
(2013) identified compound heterozygous mutations in the TRIM2 gene: a
c.680A-T transversion, resulting in a glu227-to-val (E227V) substitution
at a highly conserved residue in the coiled-coil domain, and a 1-bp
deletion (c.1699delA; 614141.0002), resulting in a frameshift and
premature termination (Lys567ArgfsTer7). The mutations were found by
whole-exome sequencing and segregated with the disorder in the family.
Neither were present in the dbSNP or 1000 Genomes databases or in 366
Finnish control chromosomes. Studies of patient fibroblasts showed that
the c.1699delA mutant transcript underwent nonsense-mediated mRNA decay,
and that there were low levels of the E227V mutant protein, indicating
that it is unstable. Transfection of the E227V mutation into HEK293
cells confirmed reduced stability of the mutant protein. The findings
were consistent with a loss of TRIM2 function.

PLATELET PROTEOGLYCAN PROTEIN CORE; PPG;;
PROTEOGLYCAN PROTEIN CORE FOR MAST CELL SECRETORY GRANULE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The proteoglycans that are stored in the secretory granules of many
hematopoietic cells contain a peptide core, termed serglycin (or
'serine/glycine-rich peptide core of secretory granule proteoglycan'),
with a protease-resistant, glycosaminoglycan-attachment region
consisting predominantly of alternating serine and glycine residues
(summary by Humphries et al., 1992). Serglycin proteoglycans have been
isolated that contain O-linked heparin, heparan sulfate, chondroitin
sulfate A, etc.

CLONING

The promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 is a transformed human cell
that synthesizes chondroitin sulfate to proteoglycans and stores the
proteoglycans in its secretory granules. Under certain in vitro
conditions this cell can be induced to differentiate into cells that
resemble neutrophils, monocyte-macrophages, eosinophils, and basophils.
Stevens et al. (1988) used a rat cell-derived cDNA for a proteoglycan to
isolate a cDNA from an HL-60 cell cDNA library. As assessed by Northern
and Southern blot analyses, a single gene encodes the 1.3-kb mRNA for
this proteoglycan peptide core. The deduced amino acid sequence includes
an 18-amino acid glycosaminoglycan attachment region that consists
primarily of alternating serine and glycine.

Perin et al. (1988) characterized the protein core of platelet
proteoglycan and Alliel et al. (1988) determined its complete amino acid
structure by a combination of protein and cDNA sequencing.

Mattei et al. (1989) found that the sequence of the peptide core of the
secretory granule proteoglycan was identical to that of PPG.

Bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC) synthesize 200- to 250-kD highly
acidic proteoglycans containing glycosaminoglycans that are almost
exclusively chondroitin sulfate E. These intracellular proteoglycans are
stored in secretory granules. Avraham et al. (1989) isolated and
sequenced a full-length cDNA from a mouse BMMC-derived cDNA library. The
same peptide core is found in all cells of bone marrow origin (Austen,
1990); see Rothenberg et al. (1988) and Avraham et al. (1988) for
information on the eosinophil proteoglycan and the basophil
proteoglycan, respectively. Differences in the secretory granules of the
several cell types are related to the sugar moieties that are
polymerized onto the glycine-serine copolymer to form the
glycosoaminoglycan.

Humphries et al. (1992) determined the complete nucleotide sequence of
the human serglycin gene.

MAPPING

By probing DNA from a panel of human/mouse and human/hamster hybrid
cells with the cDNA, Stevens et al. (1988) showed that the gene that
encodes the HL-60 cell proteoglycan peptide core resides on chromosome
10. The mouse gene encoding the proteoglycan peptide core is located on
chromosome 10 (Avraham et al., 1988).

Mattei et al. (1989) showed by in situ hybridization that the PRG1 gene
is located in band 10q22.1.

GENE STRUCTURE

Humphries et al. (1992) determined that the human serglycin gene
contains 3 exons and spans 16.7 kb. The exons and introns 1 and 2
comprise 7, 53, and 40% of the gene, respectively.

TOCOPHEROL-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1; TAP1;;
TAP KIAA1186
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Hirosawa et al. (1999) cloned a partial cDNA encoding SEC14L2,
which they designated KIAA1186. RT-PCR followed by ELISA detected
moderate expression in kidney, spleen, testis, ovary, and fetal liver.
Lower levels were detected in whole brain, lung, and adult liver.

Zimmer et al. (2000) sequenced peptide fragments from bovine SEC14L2,
which they called TAP, and searched a database using these sequences to
identify human TAP. Using RT-PCR they cloned full-length TAP from human
small intestine total RNA. The deduced 403-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of about 46 kD and contains a conserved
hydrophobic lipid-binding pocket called the CRAL (cis-retinal
binding)/TRIO (triple function) domain. Human and bovine TAP share about
84% amino acid identity. mRNA dot blot analysis detected broad tissue
distribution, with highest expression in liver, prostate, and brain.
Northern blot analysis detected a major transcript of 2.8 kb and 2 minor
transcripts of approximately 4.2 and 2.8 kb expressed at highest levels
in liver and brain and more weakly in kidney.

By immunocytochemical studies, Kempna et al. (2003) showed that SEC14L2
localized to intracellular membranes of the cytoplasm in HeLa cells,
including partial localization to the ER and Golgi, with more intense
staining surrounding but not within the nucleus.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a biotinylated alpha-tocopherol derivative, Zimmer et al. (2000)
demonstrated that recombinant TAP binds alpha-tocopherol at physiologic
concentrations. Binding was dose dependent and saturable.

By ligand competition analysis, Yamauchi et al. (2001) confirmed
specific interaction between recombinant TAP and alpha-tocopherol. TAP
did not significantly interact with any other tocopherols or
tocotrienols examined. Alpha-tocopherol induced the translocation of TAP
from the cytosol to the nucleus of transfected COS-7 cells. Transient
transfection experiments showed that TAP activated transcription of a
reporter gene in an alpha-tocopherol-dependent manner. Yamauchi et al.
(2001) hypothesized that alpha-tocopherol is not only an antioxidant,
but also a transcriptional regulator via its association with TAP.

Kempna et al. (2003) showed that in HeLa cells deletion of the
C-terminal Golgi dynamics (GOLD) domain reduced SEC14L2 localization in
the region surrounding the nucleus with some tubular sacs emerging. They
suggested that the SEC14L2 GOLD domain may play a role in docking to
other proteins or in intracellular transport of bound ligands. Using
several assays, Kempna et al. (2003) demonstrated that SEC14L2 bound
tocopherol, squalene, and phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine,
phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylglycerol). Although SEC14L2 bound
phospholipids, it failed to complement an S. cerevisiae
temperature-sensitive Sec14 allele in yeast. Using immunoprecipitation
assays, Kempna et al. (2003) showed that SEC14L2 may interact with and
regulate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity, and SEC14L2 displayed
low basal GTPase activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zimmer et al. (2000) determined that the SEC14L2 gene contains 12 exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Hirosawa et al. (1999) mapped the SEC14L2
gene to chromosome 22. By genomic sequence analysis, Zimmer et al.
(2000) mapped the SEC14L2 gene to chromosome 22q12.1-qter.

;;TETRATRICOPEPTIDE REPEAT DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; TTC2;;
TPR2;;
DJ11
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DNAJC7 belongs to the evolutionarily conserved DNAJ/HSP40 family of
proteins, which regulate molecular chaperone activity by stimulating
ATPase activity. DNAJ proteins may have up to 3 distinct domains: a
conserved 70-amino acid J domain, usually at the N terminus; a
glycine/phenylalanine (G/F)-rich region; and a cysteine-rich domain
containing 4 motifs resembling a zinc finger domain (Ohtsuka and Hata,
2000).

CLONING

Tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) elements were first identified in 1990 as
34-amino acid degenerate repeating motifs encoded in the genes for
fungal proteins involved in the regulation of cell division and RNA
synthesis (see TPR1; 601963). Murthy et al. (1996) identified the human
TPR2 gene via a 2-hybrid screen using a truncated neurofibromin (613113)
GAP-related segment as bait. TPR2 is ubiquitously expressed as a 2.2-kb
transcript encoding 7 TPR motifs. A separate region of the TPR2 cDNA has
similarity to the J region of the DnaJ family.

By searching EST databases for J domain-containing proteins, Ohtsuka and
Hata (2000) identified 10 mouse and human DNAJ homologs, including mouse
Dnajc7. The predicted type III transmembrane protein contains 494 amino
acids, with a J domain from residues 379 to 448. Mouse and human DNAJC7
share 96% amino acid identity. By Northern blot analysis, Miyoshi et al.
(2001) determined that mouse Dnajc7 is ubiquitously expressed, with
highest expression in testis, liver, heart, and brain.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a Drosophila model for Huntington disease (143100) and other
polyglutamine diseases to screen for genetic factors modifying the
degeneration caused by expression of polyglutamine in the eye,
Kazemi-Esfarjani and Benzer (2000) isolated several suppressor strains,
2 of which led to the discovery of suppressor genes. The predicted
product of one is TPR2, which is homologous to the human
tetratricopeptide repeat protein-2. That of the second is HDJ1,
homologous to human HDJ1 (DNAJB1; 604572). The suppression of
polyglutamine toxicity was verified in transgenic flies.

GENE STRUCTURE

Miyoshi et al. (2001) determined that the mouse Dnajc7 gene contains 14
exons and spans 37 kb.

MAPPING

Murthy et al. (1996) mapped the TPR2 gene to 17q11-q23 by Southern
analysis of genomic DNA from human-rodent somatic cell hybrids.

Miyoshi et al. (2001) mapped the mouse Dnajc7 gene to chromosome 11. It
lies in a tail to-tail orientation with the Cnp1 gene (123830),
downstream of the Stat5b gene (604260).

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening a human skeletal muscle cDNA library with a cosmid fragment
obtained from Xq28 by use of an enhanced promoter trap system, Toyoda et
al. (1996) cloned a partial XAP5 cDNA, which they called HXC-26.
Mazzarella et al. (1997) cloned a full-length XAP5 cDNA from a human
teratocarcinoma cDNA library. The full-length cDNA encodes a deduced
339-amino acid soluble protein with a predicted molecular mass of
approximately 40 kD. It contains 23% basic residues and an SV40 large T
antigen nuclear localization signal. By Northern blot analysis,
Mazzarella et al. (1997) detected a major 1.4-kb band in all tissues
examined, with an additional 1.8-kb band detectable in some tissues.
Expression was abundant in fetal brain, liver, and especially kidney,
with little signal from the equivalent adult organs; expression was high
in adult heart, skeletal muscle, spleen, thymus, prostate, and small
intestine.

GENE STRUCTURE

The XAP5 gene contains 13 exons and spans 6.5 to 8 kb of genomic
sequence (Toyoda et al., 1996; Mazzarella et al., 1997). Mazzarella et
al. (1997) identified a polymorphic CCG repeat region in the 5-prime UTR
of XAP5.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By examination of 48 unrelated males with a PCR assay across the CCG
repeat region of the XAP5 gene, Mazzarella et al. (1997) demonstrated
that the longest CCG runs ranged from 8 to 12 repeats, with 9 repeats
being the most frequent.

MAPPING

(1997) identified the FAM50A gene at Xq28.

604915	TITLE *604915 MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE KINASE KINASE 13; MAP3K13
;;LEUCINE ZIPPER-BEARING KINASE; LZK
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Protein kinases (PKs) are critical to the regulation of many cellular
processes, including growth factor response, cytoskeletal changes, gene
expression, and metabolism. PKs can be grouped based on sequence
similarities and on specificity for the acceptor amino acid. Most PKs
phosphorylate either serine/threonine or tyrosine. Some PKs, referred to
as mixed-lineage kinases (e.g., MAP3K9; 600136), have features of both
serine/threonine and tyrosine PKs. All PKs have Src homology (SH)
domains (see MAP3K11; 600050). PKs can also be grouped as receptors or
nonreceptors. Receptor PKs have a transmembrane region, an extracellular
ligand-binding domain, and an intracellular catalytic domain.

By screening a human cerebellum cDNA library with a rat brain cDNA of
unknown function, Sakuma et al. (1997) isolated a cDNA encoding a novel
PK, MAP3K13, which they called LZK (leucine zipper-bearing kinase).
Sequence analysis showed that the deduced 966-amino acid MAP3K13 protein
has no apparent signal sequence or transmembrane region but does contain
a kinase catalytic domain, a double leucine/isoleucine zipper, and an
acidic domain at its C-terminal end. The MAP3K13 catalytic domain has
features of both serine/threonine PKs and tyrosine PKs. MAP3K13 shares
86.4% amino acid identity with MAP3K12 (600447), a mixed-lineage kinase.
Northern blot analysis detected 9.5-, 8.7-, and 6.5-kb MAP3K13
transcripts most strongly in pancreas. These transcripts were also
expressed strongly in brain, liver, and placenta, but no expression was
detected in heart, lung, skeletal muscle, and kidney. Immunoblot
analysis demonstrated that MAP3K13 is expressed as a 135- to 150-kD
protein that is associated with membrane components. Functional analysis
showed that MAP3K13 has serine/threonine kinase activity and that it
activates the stress-activated PK JNK1 (601158) pathway.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the MAP3K13
gene to 3q25-q29 (TMAP SHGC-36455).

Kazantseva et al. (2006) identified the MAP3K13 gene within a 350-kb
region on chromosome 3q27 centromeric to marker D3S1530.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Demuth et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA clone, designated pHKB3, encoding a
human erythrocyte surface protein band 3-like gene product. Peptide
mapping shows substantial sequence homology between the erythrocyte band
3 protein (109270) and a band 3-like protein found in leukocytes.
Palumbo et al. (1986) described the partial sequence of a 2.7-kb human
cDNA clone encoding a band 3-related protein in nonerythroid cells.
Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence for this cDNA with the
amino acid sequences of mouse and human erythroid band 3 proteins
confirmed that the human clone is related to but distinct from erythroid
band 3. Palumbo et al. (1986) symbolized the gene as HKB3, in part after
the name of the human cell line studied.

Tanner (1993) referred to this nonerythroid anion exchanger as AE2. The
ability of AE2 to mediate anion transport has been confirmed. Northern
blotting studies showed that the AE2 gene is transcribed in a wide
variety of tissues. In the mouse, Lindsey et al. (1990) found that AE2
is expressed only in choroid plexus, the site of cerebrospinal fluid
production. Kudrycki et al. (1990) found that, in the rat, AE2 is
particularly abundant in the stomach and portions of the
gastrointestinal tract.

GENE STRUCTURE

Medina et al. (1997) determined that the AE2 gene spans approximately 17
kb and consists of 23 exons.

MAPPING

Using somatic cell genetics and in situ hybridization, Palumbo et al.
(1986) mapped the HKB3 gene to 7q35-q36. Showe et al. (1993) identified
an MboI RFLP in the EPB3L1 gene. White et al. (1994) demonstrated that
the murine AE2 gene is located on chromosome 5. This result was obtained
by analysis of recombinant inbred lines and by interspecific backcross
analysis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Medina et al. (2003) disrupted the mouse Ae2 gene in a manner that
prevented the expression of 3 Ae2 isoforms normally found in testis.
Male Ae2 -/- mice, but not female Ae2 -/- mice, were infertile.
Histopathologic analysis of mutant testis showed an interruption in
spermiogenesis, with only a few late spermatids and a complete absence
of spermatozoa in the seminiferous tubules. The number of apoptotic
bodies was increased in the seminiferous tubules and in the epididymis,
which also showed squamous metaplasia of the epididymal epithelium.

DESCRIPTION Gamma-tubulin is an essential component of the microtubule organizing
centers of eukaryotes. By screening a HeLa cell cDNA library with a
sequence fragment showing homology to gamma-1-tubulin (TUBG1; 191135),
Wise et al. (2000) obtained a partial TUBG2 cDNA. By EST database
searching, they obtained a full-length TUBG2 cDNA clone encoding a
451-amino acid protein that shares 97.3% sequence identity with TUBG1.
By RT-PCR analysis, Wise et al. (2000) detected expression of both TUBG1
and TUBG2 in all tissues examined, although at varying levels.

By radiation hybrid analysis, Wise et al. (2000) mapped the TUBG2 gene
to chromosome 17q21 within 20 kb of TUBG1. They mapped a TUBG2
pseudogene to chromosome 7.

614314	TITLE *614314 ACYL-CoA THIOESTERASE 4; ACOT4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Acyl-CoA thioesterases (ACOTs; EC 3.1.2.2), such as ACOT4, hydrolyze
acyl-CoAs to the free fatty acid and CoA. ACOTs therefore play key roles
in maintaining the intracellular ratio between CoA esters of various
lipids and free fatty acids (summary by Hunt et al., 2006).

CLONING

By searching a database for orthologs of mouse Acot genes, followed by
RT-PCR of liver total RNA, Hunt et al. (2006) cloned human ACOT4. The
deduced 421-amino acid protein has a putative catalytic site and a
possible C-terminal peroxisome-targeting signal. Northern blot analysis
detected ACOT4 transcripts of about 1.7 and 2.2 kb. Expression was
highest in liver and kidney and weaker in placenta, heart, and skeletal
muscle. Fluorescence-tagged ACOT4 showed a punctate cytoplasmic pattern
of expression in transfected human skin fibroblasts.

GENE FUNCTION

By assaying recombinant human proteins, Hunt et al. (2006) found that
ACOT4, like its mouse ortholog, showed highest activity with
succinyl-CoA as substrate. However, unlike mouse Acot4, human ACOT4 also
hydrolyzed all long-chain saturated acyl-CoAs of more than 8 carbon
atoms and all unsaturated acyl-CoAs tested (C18:1, C18:2, and C20:4).
Hunt et al. (2006) noted that the pattern of activity of human ACOT4
mirrored the combined activities of mouse Acot3, Acot4, and Acot5, and
that there are no human orthologs of Acot3 and Acot5.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hunt et al. (2006) determined that the ACOT4 gene contains 3 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Hunt et al. (2006) mapped the ACOT4 gene
to an 80-kb ACOT gene cluster on chromosome 14q24.3. The order of the
genes, from centromere to telomere, is ACOT1 (614313), ACOT2 (609972),
ACOT4, and ACOT6 (614267). They mapped the mouse Acot1 gene to a similar
Acot gene cluster on chromosome 12D3, except that the mouse Acot cluster
includes 2 additional genes, Acot3 and Acot5, that do not have human
orthologs. Hunt et al. (2006) noted that a possible expressed pseudogene
of ACOT4 maps to chromosome 19q13.12.

;;ACYL-CoA:MONOACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE 2;;
MGAT2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Dietary fat absorption from the small intestine is facilitated by
acyl-CoA:monoacylglycerol transferase (MOGAT; EC 2.3.1.22) and
acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT; see 604900) activities.
MOGAT catalyzes the joining of monoacylglycerol and fatty acyl-CoAs to
form diacylglycerol (Yen and Farese, 2003).

CLONING

By database analysis with the sequence of mouse Mogat1 (610268) as
query, Cao et al. (2003) identified and cloned mouse Mogat2 by PCR
amplification. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues showed strong
expression in small intestine, kidney, and adipose tissue, moderate
expression in stomach, and weak expression in liver, skeletal muscle,
and spleen.

Yen and Farese (2003) identified and cloned mouse and human MOGAT2 based
on their homology with DGAT2 (606983). MOGAT2 encodes a 334-amino acid
protein with a predicted molecular mass of 38.2 kD. Yen and Farese
(2003) also identified a 284-amino acid splice variant, in which an
unspliced intron introduces 67 different C-terminal residues and a
premature stop codon. MOGAT2 contains a phosphate acyltransferase-like
domain and 2 predicted N-linked glycosylation sites. Northern blot
analysis revealed expression of 7.2-, 3.0-, and 1.3-kb transcripts in
liver, stomach, and small intestine, with lower expression in colon and
kidney. A probe specific to the truncated splice variant hybridized
mainly to the 1.3-kb transcript in stomach. Immunofluorescence analysis
of transiently transfected COS-7 cells showed that MGAT2 displayed a
pattern consistent with localization in the endoplasmic reticulum.

GENE FUNCTION

Using transient transfection of mouse Mogat2 in AV-12, COS-7, and Caco-2
cells, Cao et al. (2003) showed that Mogat activity was significantly
higher than in untransfected/mock-transfected cells. These assays also
showed that Mogat2 possesses weak Dgat activity. Kinetics analysis of
Mogat2-transfected COS-7 cells demonstrated that Mogat2 activity is
time-, Mogat2 protein concentration-, and substrate
concentration-dependent.

Using transfections of insect and mammalian cells with MOGAT2, Yen and
Farese (2003) showed that MOGAT activity is increased in cell membranes.
This MOGAT activity is proportional to the level of MOGAT2 protein
expressed and dependent on substrate concentration. Transfection assays
also showed that MOGAT2 exhibits minor DGAT activity. Substrate
specificity assays of MOGAT2 demonstrated that MOGAT2 can catalyze the
acylation of rac-1- and sn-2-monooleoylglycerols. MOGAT2 uses a broad
range of fatty acyl-CoAs but prefers monoacylglycerols containing
unsaturated fatty acids.

Cao et al. (2003) performed a variety of in vitro analyses on mouse
Mogat2 expressed in mammalian and bacterial cells, which showed that
Mogat2 activity is stimulated by phosphatidylcholine,
phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidic acid. Mogat2 activity is inhibited
by nonionic and zwitterionic detergents, in contrast to DGAT1, which is
activated by these detergents. Assays on bacterially expressed Mogat2
confirmed the DGAT activity of Mogat2.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yen and Farese (2003) stated that the MOGAT2 gene contains 6 exons.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the MOGAT2
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP SHGC-32865). Yen and Farese (2003) stated
that the MOGAT2 gene maps to chromosome 11q13.5 and the mouse homolog to
chromosome 7.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yen et al. (2009) found that Mgat2 -/- mice were born at the expected
mendelian frequency and were indistinguishable from wildtype animals
when fed a low-fat diet. However, they had 50% reduced intestinal MGAT
activity compared with wildtype mice, and when fed a high-fat diet, they
were protected against development of obesity, glucose intolerance,
hypercholesterolemia, and fatty liver. Caloric intake was normal in
Mgat2 -/- mice, and dietary fat was absorbed fully, but the entry of
dietary fat into the circulation occurred at a reduced rate. This
altered kinetics of fat absorption appeared to result in elevated
partitioning of dietary fat toward energy dissipation rather than toward
storage in white adipose tissue. Yen et al. (2009) concluded that MGAT2
has a crucial role in the assimilation of dietary fat and accretion of
body fat.

605241	TITLE *605241 LYMPHOCYTE ANTIGEN 86; LY86
;;MD1 PROTEIN; MD1
DESCRIPTION The leucine-rich repeat (LRR) is a protein motif implicated in
protein-protein interactions, and many proteins bearing this motif have
a role in defense against pathogens. RP105 (LY64; 602226) is an
LRR-bearing molecule that transmits an activation signal leading to
massive B-cell proliferation as well as resistance against apoptosis.
Md1 is a mouse secretory molecule tethered to the cell surface by Rp105.
By searching an EST database with mouse Md1, Miura et al. (1998)
identified a cDNA encoding MD1 from human fetal liver and spleen. The
deduced MD1 protein contains 162 amino acids, shares 66% amino acid
identity with mouse Md1, and has a predicted 19-amino acid signal
peptide and 2 N-glycosylation sites. Six of 7 cysteine residues in human
MD1 are conserved in mouse and chicken Md1. Northern blot analysis
detected a 1.0-kb MD1 transcript in B-cell lines and the U937 monocyte
line, but no expression was detected in 2 T-cell lines or in the K562
erythroleukemia line. Western blot and flow cytometry analysis
demonstrated that expression of MD1, an approximately 25-kD protein,
enhances surface expression of RP105. The authors found that MD1 is also
expressed on the surface despite its lack of a transmembrane region.

601627	TITLE *601627 SURVIVAL OF MOTOR NEURON 2; SMN2
;;SURVIVAL OF MOTOR NEURON, CENTROMERIC COPY; SMNC;;
C-BCD541
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The SMN1 (600354) and SMN2 genes lie within the telomeric and
centromeric halves, respectively, of a large, inverted duplication on
chromosome 5q13. These genes share more than 99% nucleotide identity,
and both are capable of encoding a 294-amino acid RNA-binding protein,
SMN, that is required for efficient assembly of small nuclear
ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complexes. Homozygous loss of the SMN1 gene
causes spinal muscular atrophy (SMA; 253300). Absence of SMN1 is
partially compensated for by SMN2, which produces enough SMN protein to
allow for relatively normal development in cell types other than motor
neurons. However, SMN2 cannot fully compensate for loss of SMN1 because,
although SMN2 is transcribed at a level comparable to that of SMN1, a
large majority of SMN2 transcripts lack exon 7, resulting in production
of a truncated, less stable SMN protein (Lefebvre et al., 1995; Kashima
et al., 2007).

CLONING

Lefebvre et al. (1995) described an inverted duplication of a 500-kb
element in normal chromosome 5q13, which contains the gene for spinal
muscular atrophy. Within the telomeric region, they identified the SMN1
gene. A highly homologous gene, referred to as C-BCD541 and also known
as SMNC or SMN2, was present in the duplicated centromeric element in
95% of controls. PCR amplification and sequence analysis revealed 5
nucleotide discrepancies between the centromeric and telomeric SMN
genes, 2 of which occur in exons 7 and 8. The centromeric SMN gene
undergoes alternative splicing of exon 7, resulting in a truncated mRNA
transcript lacking exon 7 and a putative protein with a different
C-terminal end.

Using a panel of anti-SMN antibodies, Coovert et al. (1997) demonstrated
that the SMN protein is expressed from both the SMN1 and SMN2 genes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Burglen et al. (1996) determined that the SMN gene has 9 exons and spans
approximately 20 kb. Burglen et al. (1996) referred to exon 2 as exons
2a and 2b.

Boda et al. (2004) determined that the first 4.6 kb of the SMN1 and SMN2
promoters are identical. The promoters contain 12 SP1 (189906), 8 AP1
(see 165160), 3 AP2 (107580), 6 HNF3 (see 602294), 24 Zeste (see
601674), and 4 RXR-beta (180246) sites. There are no RE1 elements. Boda
et al. (2004) transfected primary cultures of mouse embryonic spinal
cord and fibroblasts with constructs containing 1.8, 3.2, or 4.6 kb of
the promoter region fused to a reporter gene. Expression of the 1.8- and
3.2-kb constructs was stronger in spinal cord than in fibroblast
cultures; the 4.6-kb construct gave 5-fold higher expression in neurons
than in fibroblasts, with expression in fibroblasts lower than that
achieved with the 3.2-kb construct. Boda et al. (2004) concluded that
these results suggest the presence of an enhancer element between 1.8
and 3.2 kb upstream from the transcriptional start site of the SMN genes
that functions in both culture types, and a silencer between 3.2 and 4.6
kb that is active only in fibroblast cultures.

MAPPING

Lefebvre et al. (1995) determined that the SMN2 gene lies within the
centromeric half of a large inverted duplication on chromosome 5q13. The
SMN1 gene lies in the telomeric half of the duplication.

GENE FUNCTION

Monani et al. (1999) sequenced 3 genomic clones over 32 kb in length,
which spanned both the SMN1 and SMN2 genes. Of 35 sequence differences
noted between SMN1 and SMN2, only 3 were located in either exon 7 or
intron 7. Of note was a translationally silent 840C-T transition at
position +6 in exon 7, which affects splicing. Using minigene
constructs, the authors found that the presence of cytosine at position
+6 in exon 7 produced a normal splicing pattern retaining exon 7,
whereas thymine in this position resulted in the absence of exon 7 in
the majority of the transcripts. Since the majority of human SMN2
transcripts lack exon 7, the authors hypothesized that the 5-prime
portion of exon 7 in SMN1 contains an exonic splice enhancer (ESE), and
that low levels of full-length SMN transcript are responsible for the
SMA phenotype.

Andreassi et al. (2001) screened a library of compounds and found that
aclarubicin increased the retention of exon 7 into the SMN2 transcript
from the endogenous gene in type I SMA fibroblasts, as well as from an
SMN2 minigene in a motor neuron cell line. In type I fibroblasts,
treatment resulted in an increase in SMN protein and gems to normal
levels. The authors demonstrated the utility of high-throughput screens
in detecting compounds that affect the splicing pattern of a gene, and
suggested that alteration of splicing patterns may represent a feasible
approach to modification of gene expression in disease treatment.

Using in vivo splicing assays, Hofmann and Wirth (2002) identified the
protein hnRNPG (300199) and its paralog RBM (400006) as 2 novel splicing
factors that promote the inclusion of SMN2 exon 7. Both hnRNPG and RBM
nonspecifically bind RNA, but directly and specifically bind
Htra2-beta1, an SR-like splicing factor which stimulates inclusion of
exon 7 through a direct interaction with SMN2 exon 7 pre-mRNA. Using
deletion mutants of hnRNPG, the authors demonstrated a specific
protein-protein interaction of hnRNPG with Htra2-beta1 which mediates
the inclusion of SMN2 exon 7 rather than the nonspecific interaction of
hnRNPG with SMN pre-mRNA. These trans-acting splicing factors were also
effective on endogenous SMN2 transcripts and increased the endogenous
SMN protein level. The authors presented a model of how exon 7 mRNA
processing may be regulated by these splicing factors.

Kashima and Manley (2003) showed that the exonic splicing silencer in
SMN2 functions as a binding site for a known repressor protein, HNRNPA1
(164017), which binds to SMN2 but not SMN1 exon 7 RNA. By using small
interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to reduce HNRNPA1 protein levels in living
cells, Kashima and Manley (2003) demonstrated efficient SMN2 exon 7
splicing. The findings not only defined a new mechanism underlying the
inefficient splicing of SMN2 exon 7 but also illustrated more generally
the remarkable sensitivity and precision that characterizes control of
mRNA splicing. The work also made it possible to consider therapeutic
approaches to spinal muscular atrophy that involved decreasing HNRNPA1
RNA binding to or function on SMN2 exon 7.

Helmken et al. (2003) stated that sibs with identical 5q13 homologs and
homozygous absence of SMN1 can have variable phenotypes, suggesting that
the spinal muscular atrophy phenotype is modified by other factors,
which function either on the transcriptional level, to produce more
full-length SMN (FL-SMN) transcripts, or on the translational level, to
increase the amount of SMN2 protein. By analyzing 9 SMA discordant
families, Helmken et al. (2003) demonstrated that in all families
unaffected sibs produced significantly higher amounts of SMN,
SMN-interacting protein-1 (SIP1; 602595), GEMIN3 (606168), ZPR1
(603901), and hnRNPQ protein in lymphoblastoid cell lines, but not in
primary fibroblasts, compared with their affected sibs. The results
suggested that the modifying factor or factors act on the SMN gene to
influence SMN protein levels, thus modifying the SMA phenotype, and not
through an independent pathway. In addition, the observed coregulations
appeared to be tissue-specific. SMN significantly coregulated its
interacting partners, including its own splicing factor, HTRA2-beta-1
(see 606441), due to an indirect feedback mechanism. Thus, Helmken et
al. (2003) showed that reduction of the SMN protein has a significant
impact on the expression level of a splicing factor.

Brichta et al. (2003) showed that in fibroblast cultures derived from
SMA patients treated with therapeutic doses of valproic acid, the level
of full-length SMN2 mRNA/protein increased 2- to 4-fold. This
upregulation of SMN was most likely attributable to increased levels of
HTRA2-beta-1 as well as to SMN gene transcription activation. Valproic
acid also increased SMN protein levels through transcription activation
in organotypic hippocampal rat brain slices. Additionally, valproic acid
increased the expression of other serine-arginine family proteins, which
may have important implications for other disorders affected by
alternative splicing.

Grzeschik et al. (2005) reported that cultured lymphocytes from patients
with SMA showed increased production of the full-length SMN mRNA and
protein in response to treatment with hydroxyurea. The findings
suggested that hydroxyurea promoted inclusion of exon 7 during SMN2
transcription.

Kernochan et al. (2005) investigated the levels of acetylated H3 and H4
histones and histone deacetylases (HDACs) associated with different
regions of the human and mouse SMN genes in both cultured cells and
tissues. The SMN gene had a reproducible pattern of histone acetylation
that was largely conserved among different tissues and species. A
limited region of the promoter surrounding the transcriptional start
site had relatively high levels of histone acetylation. After HDAC
inhibitor treatment, acetylated histone levels increased, particularly
at upstream regions, correlating with a 2-fold increase in promoter
activity. During development in mouse tissues, histone acetylation
levels decreased and associated HDAC2 (605164) levels increased at the
region closest to the transcriptional start site, correlating with a 40
to 60% decrease in SMN transcript and protein levels. Kernochan et al.
(2005) suggested that histone acetylation may modulate SMN gene
expression.

Skipping of SMN2 exon 7 had been attributed to either the loss of an
SF2/ASF-dependent exonic splicing enhancer or the creation of an hnRNP
A/B-dependent exonic splicing silencer, as a result of the C-to-T
transition. Cartegni et al. (2006) reported the extensive testing of the
enhancer-loss and silencer-gain models by mutagenesis, RNA interference,
overexpression, RNA splicing, and RNA-protein interaction experiments.
The results supported the enhancer-loss model but also demonstrated that
hnRNP A/B proteins antagonize SF2/ASF-dependent ESE activity and promote
exon 7 skipping by a mechanism that is independent of the C-to-T
transition and is, therefore, common to both SMN1 and SMN2. The findings
explained the basis of defective SMN2 splicing, illustrated the fine
balance between positive and negative determinants of exon identity and
alternative splicing, and underscored the importance of antagonistic
splicing factors and exonic elements in a disease context.

Kashima et al. (2007) showed that the 840C-T transition in SMN2 created
a high-affinity HNRNPA1-binding site. Depletion of HNRNPA1 in HeLa cells
restored exon 7 inclusion, indicating that splicing of exon 7 in SMN2 is
repressed by an HNRNPA1-dependent exonic splicing silencer.

Kashima et al. (2007) identified a novel single nucleotide difference
between SMN1 and SMN2, an A-to-G change at position +100 within intron 7
of SMN2, which creates a second high-affinity HNRNPA1-binding site
specific to SMN2. Base substitutions that disrupted this site in SMN2
restored exon 7 inclusion in vivo and prevented HNRNPA1 binding in
vitro. Kashima et al. (2007) proposed that interactions between HNRNPA1
molecules bound to the exonic and intronic sites cooperate to exclude
exon 7 in SMN2.

Angelozzi et al. (2008) found that salbutamol increased full-length SMN2
mRNA transcript levels in fibroblasts derived from patients with SMA.
The maximum increase (over 200%) was observed after 30 to 60 minutes.
This rapid rise correlated with decreased levels of SMN2 mRNA with
deletion of exon 7. Salbutamol treatment also resulted in increased SMN
protein levels and nuclear gems.

Using SMN minigenes, Gladman and Chandler (2009) identified 2 elements
within intron 7 of the SMN genes that influenced exon 7 splicing in a
cell type-independent manner.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Spinal Muscular Atrophy

Hahnen et al. (1996) reported molecular analysis of 42 SMA patients who
carried homozygous deletions of exon 7 but not of exon 8 in the
telomeric copy of the SMN gene (SMN1). Additional homozygous deletions
of exon 8 in the centromeric copy of SMN (SMN2) were found in 2 of the
patients. By a simple PCR test, they demonstrated the existence of
hybrid SMN genes, i.e., genes composed of both the centromeric SMN2 and
the telomeric SMN1. They reported a high frequency of hybrid SMN genes
in SMA patients with Czech or Polish background. Hahnen et al. (1996)
identified a single haplotype for half of the hybrid genes analyzed,
suggesting that in these cases the SMA chromosomes shared a common
origin.

Schwartz et al. (1997) used solid-phase minisequencing to determine the
ratio between the number of telomeric and centromeric copies of the SMN
gene in affected and unaffected members of 30 SMA families. Six
predominant haplotypes were identified, 3 for normal chromosomes and 3
for SMA chromosomes, characterized by having 0, 1, or 2 copies,
respectively, of SMN2. They found patients homozygous for a deletion of
SMN1 and with only one copy of SMN2, but found none deleted for all
copies of SMN2. Several asymptomatic carriers of SMA with only a single
copy of SMN1 and no copy of SMN2 were identified. Schwartz et al. (1997)
could not confirm the hypothesis that the presence of more copies of
SMN2 is correlated with a less severe course of the disease. The
frequencies of haplotypes characterized by having 0, 1, or 2 copies,
respectively, of SMN2 were found to differ significantly between normal
and SMA chromosomes. This distribution could be explained by an
underrepresentation of the haplotype completely lacking SMN genes, which
is expected to cause early embryonic death in homozygotes.

Srivastava et al. (2001) reported a 5-year-old boy with childhood-onset
SMA who had a homozygous deletion of SMN2. He had wasting, weakness, and
hyporeflexia, predominantly in the distal muscles. The affected muscles
showed chronic neurogenic changes on electromyography. There was no
sensory involvement. A nerve conduction study showed near-normal
conduction velocity with reduction in the amplitude of the compound
muscle action potential. The SMN2 deletion was demonstrated by studies
of exons 7 and 8 of the SMN genes. Base sequencing and densitometric
analysis of the critical exon 7 region did not show any microdeletion or
duplication of SMN1, but confirmed the deletion of SMN2. Srivastava et
al. (2001) concluded that deletion of SMN2 can also result in the SMA
phenotype.

Feldkotter et al. (2002) developed a quantitative test for either SMN1
or SMN2 to analyze SMA patients for their SMN2 copy number and to
correlate the SMN2 copy number with type of SMA and duration of
survival. The quantitative analysis of SMN2 copies in 375 patients with
type I, type II, or type III SMA showed a significant correlation
between SMN2 copy number and type of SMA as well as duration of
survival. Thus, 80% of patients with type I SMA carried 1 or 2 SMN2
copies and 82% of patients with type II SMA carried 3 SMN2 copies,
whereas 96% of patients with type III SMA carried 3 or 4 SMN2 copies.
Among 113 patients with type I SMA, 9 with 1 SMN2 copy lived less than
11 months, 88 of 94 with 2 SMN2 copies lived less than 21 months, and 8
of 10 with 3 SMN2 copies lived 33 to 66 months. On the basis of SMN2
copy number, Feldkotter et al. (2002) calculated the posterior
probability that a child with homozygous absence of SMN1 will develop
type I, type II, or type III SMA.

Ogino et al. (2004) analyzed all 'available and reliable' data to
calculate allele/haplotype frequencies and new mutation rates in the SMN
region. The authors stated that their data provided the basis for the
most accurate genetic risk calculations as well as evidence that
nucleotide position 840 constitutes a mutation hotspot. Ogino et al.
(2004) suggested that there is selection of the single-copy SMN1-SMN2
haplotype and that rare chromosomes with 3 copies of SMN1 exist.

Wirth et al. (2006) analyzed SMN2 copy number in 115 patients with SMA3
(253400) or SMA4 (271150) who had confirmed homozygous absence of SMN1
and found that 62% of SMA3 patients with age of onset less than 3 years
had 2 or 3 SMN2 copies, whereas 65% of SMA3 patients with age of onset
greater than 3 years had 4 to 5 SMN2 copies. Of the 4 adult-onset (SMA4)
patients, 3 had 4 SMN2 copies and 1 had 6 copies. Wirth et al. (2006)
concluded that SMN2 may have a disease-modifying role in SMA, with a
greater SMN2 copy number associated with later onset and better
prognosis.

Hauke et al. (2009) demonstrated that SMN2 is subject to gene silencing
by DNA methylation. SMN2 contains 4 CpG islands which present highly
conserved methylation patterns and little interindividual variation in
SMN1-deleted SMA patients. The comprehensive analysis of SMN2
methylation in patients suffering from severe versus mild SMA carrying
identical SMN2 copy numbers revealed a correlation of CpG methylation at
the positions -290 and -296 with disease severity and the activity of
the first transcriptional start site of SMN2 at position -296. The
methyl-CpG-binding protein-2 (MECP2; 300005), a transcriptional
repressor, bound to the critical SMN2 promoter region in a
methylation-dependent manner. The authors identified histone deacetylase
(HDAC) inhibitors (including vorinostat and romidepsin) that were able
to bypass SMN2 gene silencing by DNA methylation, while others (such as
valproic acid and phenylbutyrate) did not, due to HDAC isoenzyme
specificities. The authors concluded that DNA methylation is
functionally important regarding SMA disease progression, and
pharmacologic SMN2 gene activation might have implications for future
SMA therapy regimens.

- Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis

Moulard et. al. (1998) found homozygous deletions of SMN2 in 36% of
individuals with sporadic adult-onset lower motor neuron disease (LMND),
but in only 6.2% of individuals with sporadic amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS; 105400) and 1.5% of individuals with familial ALS. The
authors argued that SMN2, but not SMN1, deletions are a susceptibility
factor for LMND, a disorder distinguishable from ALS by the absence of
upper motor neuron signs. LMND patients with SMN2 deletions differed
from those patients without such deletions by earlier age of onset (40
vs 56 years), more rapid disease progression (25 vs 36 months to death),
and a lower preponderance of males (M:F ratio of 1.5 vs 2.5).

Among 124 ALS patients, Gamez et al. (2002) found no association between
homozygous deletion of SMN2 and disease onset, respiratory decline, or
survival. A homozygous SMN2 deletion was identified in 11 (8.8%)
patients and 20 (10%) of 200 control individuals. Corcia et al. (2002)
found no difference in SMN2 gene copies among 167 ALS patients and 167
controls. Homozygous deletion of the SMN2 gene was found in 9 and 10% of
patients and controls, respectively. Among 600 patients with sporadic
ALS, Corcia et al. (2006) found no disease association with SMN2 copy
number.

Crawford and Skolasky (2002) briefly reviewed several reported
associations of SMN to ALS and concluded that the findings likely
represented nonsignificant or borderline significant fluctuations.
Corcia et al. (2002) responded that although they still supported a role
for the SMN2 gene in LMND (Moulard et al., 1998), the evidence of an
association between homozygous SMN2 deletion and ALS was less
convincing.

EVOLUTION

Rochette et al. (2001) used a number of approaches to probe the
evolutionary history of the SMN1 and SMN2 genes and showed that SMN gene
duplication and the appearance of SMN2 occurred at very distinct
evolutionary times. Molecular fossil and molecular clock data suggested
that this duplication may have occurred as recently as 3 million years
ago in that the position and repetitive elements are identical for both
human SMN genes and overall sequence divergence ranges from 0.15 to
0.34%. However, these approaches ignored the possibility of sequence
homogenization by means of gene conversion. Consequently, Rochette et
al. (2001) used quantitative polymerase chain reaction and analysis of
allelic variants to provide physical evidence for or against SMN gene
duplication in the chimpanzee, mankind's closest relative. These studies
revealed that chimpanzees have 2 to 7 copies of the SMN gene per diploid
genome; however, the 2 nucleotides diagnostic for exons 7-8 and the
SMNdel7 mRNA product of the SMN2 gene are absent in nonhuman primates.
In contrast, the SMN2 gene has been detected in all extant human
populations studied to date, including representatives from Europe, the
Central African Republic, and the Congo. These data provided conclusive
evidence that SMN gene duplication occurred more than 5 million years
ago, before the separation of human and chimpanzee lineages, but that
SMN2 appeared for the first time in Homo sapiens.

ANIMAL MODEL

Le et al. (2005) created transgenic mice expressing SMN2 lacking exon 7
(SMN-delta-7) and crossed them onto a severe SMA background. Expression
of SMN-delta-7 appeared to extend survival of SMA mice from 5 to 13
days. Unlike mice with selective deletion of SMN exon 7 in muscle, mice
with a small amount of full-length SMN (FL-SMN) did not show a
dystrophic phenotype. The authors suggested that low levels of FL-SMN
(as found in SMA patients) and absence of FL-SMN in muscle tissue may
have different effects, and raised the question of the importance of
high SMN levels in muscle in the presentation of SMA. SMN and
SMN-delta-7 can associate with each other; Le et al. (2005) suggested
that this association may stabilize SMN-delta-7 protein turnover and
ameliorate the SMA phenotype by increasing the amount of oligomeric SMN.

In SMA-like mouse embryonic fibroblasts and human SMN2-transfected motor
neuron cells, Ting et al. (2007) found that sodium vanadate,
trichostatin A, and aclarubicin effectively enhanced SMN2 expression by
inducing Stat5 (601511) activation. This resulted in enhanced SMN2
promoter activity with an increase in both full-length and deletion exon
7 SMN transcripts in human cells with SMN2. Knockdown of Stat5
expression disrupted the effects of sodium vanadate on SMN2 activation,
but did not influence SMN2 splicing, suggesting that Stat5 signaling is
involved in SMN2 transcriptional regulation. Constitutive expression of
the activated Stat5 mutant Stat5A1*6 profoundly increased the number of
nuclear gems in SMA patient lymphocytes and reduced SMA-like motor
neuron axon outgrowth defects.

Workman et al. (2009) showed that SMN(A111G), an allele capable of snRNP
assembly (A111G; 600354.0015), can rescue mice that lacked Smn and
contained either 1 or 2 copies of SMN2 (SMA mice). The correction of SMA
in these animals was directly correlated with snRNP assembly activity in
spinal cord, as was correction of snRNA levels. These data support snRNP
assembly as being the critical function affected in SMA and suggests
that the levels of snRNPs are critical to motor neurons. Furthermore,
SMN(A111G) could not rescue Smn-null mice without SMN2, suggesting that
both SMN(A111G) and SMN from SMN2 may undergo intragenic complementation
in vivo to function in heteromeric complexes that have greater function
than either allele alone. The oligomer composed of limiting full-length
SMN and SMN(A111G) had substantial snRNP assembly activity. The SMN(A2G)
(A2G; 600354.0002) and SMN(A111G) alleles in vivo did not complement
each other, leading to the possibility that these mutations could affect
the same function.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY, MODIFIER OF
SMN2, GLY287ARG

In a 42-year-old woman with a mild form of SMA type III (253400),
despite a homozygous absence of SMN1 exon 7 (600354), Prior et al.
(2009) identified a homozygous 859G-C transversion in exon 7 of the SMN2
gene, resulting in a gly287-to-arg (G287R) substitution. In vitro
functional expression studies showed that the change resulted in the
creation of an exonic splicing enhancer element and increased the amount
of full-length SMN2 transcripts compared to wildtype. The SMN1 genotype
(0 SMN1, 0 SNM2) predicted a more severe disorder (SMA1; 253300), but
the SMN2 variant increased SMN2 transcripts, resulting in a less severe
phenotype. The same 859G-C transversion was identified in heterozygosity
in 2 additional unrelated patients with mild forms of SMA, who were
predicted to have a more severe form of the disorder from their
genotypes (0 SMN1/1 SMN2 and 0 SMN1, 2 SMN2).

601679	TITLE *601679 GENERAL TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR II-I; GTF2I
;;BTK-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN, 135-KD; BAP135;;
BRUTON TYROSINE KINASE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 135;;
TFII-I
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The GTF2I gene encodes a transcription factor (Roy et al., 1997). The
protein also negatively regulates agonist-induced calcium entry into
cells by interfering with expression of the cation channel TRPC3
(602345) at the plasma membrane (Caraveo et al., 2006).

CLONING

Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK; 300300) is essential for B-cell activation.
A defect in the BTK gene results in X-linked agammaglobulinemia. Yang
and Desiderio (1997) isolated a downstream target of BTK, a protein they
designated BAP135 that is associated with the Bruton tyrosine kinase in
B cells and is a substrate for phosphorylation by BTK. The investigators
used amino acid sequence from the purified protein to identify
overlapping expressed sequence tags (ESTs) corresponding to the gene
encoding BAP135. The resulting open reading frame predicts a 957-amino
acid polypeptide. BAP135, which exhibited no detectable homology to
known proteins, contains 6 occurrences of a hitherto undescribed amino
acid repeat and 2 motifs, similar to the Src autophosphorylation site,
that represent potential targets for tyrosine phosphorylation. Various
observations suggested to Yang and Desiderio (1997) that BAP135 may
reside downstream of BTK in a signaling pathway originating at the
B-cell receptor.

Roy et al. (1997) purified GTF2I from HeLa cell nuclear extracts. Using
probes synthesized from the known amino acid sequence, they cloned GTF2I
from a Namalwa (Burkitt lymphoma) cDNA library. The 120-kD protein has
an N-terminal hydrophobic zipper-like region suggestive of a protein
interaction domain, acidic clusters reminiscent of acidic activation
domains, and 6 directly repeated 90-residue stretches, each of which
possesses a potential helix-loop/span-helix motif. It also contains a
consensus site for MAP kinase and several Src autophosphorylation sites.
By Northern blot analysis, Roy et al. (1997) detected a 4.7-kb message
in HeLa and Namalwa cell lysates. Strong expression of 4.7- and 4.2-kb
transcripts were found in heart, brain, skeletal muscle, and pancreas,
less in lung, and little in liver and kidney.

Cheriyath and Roy (2000) cloned 4 alternatively spliced variants of
GTF2I. GTF2I-delta encodes the previously recognized 957-amino acid
protein. Within GTF2I, Cheriyath and Roy (2000) identified a nuclear
localization (NLS) signal between amino acid repeats 1 and 2 and another
between repeats 4 and 5. The GTF2I-alpha, GTF2I-beta, and GTF2I-gamma
variants encode proteins of 977, 978, and 998 amino acids, respectively.
These proteins differ from GTF2I-delta and from each other only by the
length of an insert between repeat 1 and the first NLS. Western blot
analysis detected all endogenous and epitope-tagged GTF2I isoforms
predominantly in nuclear cell fractions. Hakre et al. (2006) stated that
only the beta and delta isoforms of Gtf2i are expressed in mouse
fibroblasts.

GENE FUNCTION

Through transfection experiments, Roy et al. (1997) found that GTF2I is
capable of binding to both a pyrimidine-rich initiator (Inr) and an
E-box for upstream stimulatory factor-1 (USF1; 191523). GTF2I and USF1
can also act synergistically to activate transcription through both Inr
and the E-box elements of the adenovirus major late promoter. By in
vitro cotranslation followed by coimmunoprecipitation studies, Roy et
al. (1997) confirmed direct protein interaction between GTF2I and USF1.

By mutation analysis, Cheriyath and Roy (2000) determined that the first
NLS of GTF2I directed the nuclear localization of fluorescence-tagged
GTF2I-delta in transfected COS cells. All GTF2I isoforms formed both
homomeric and heteromeric interactions when coexpressed or when present
endogenously. Heteromeric GTF2I complexes were preferentially found
inside the nucleus, and the heteromeric interactions appeared to aid in
nuclear translocation. All 4 isoforms bound DNA and possessed similar
homomeric transactivation of reporter genes. However, heteromeric
complex formation led to differential activation of reporter genes.

Hakimi et al. (2003) identified a family of multiprotein corepressor
complexes that function through modifying chromatin structure to keep
genes silent. The polypeptide composition of these complexes includes a
common core of 2 subunits, HDAC1 (601241)/HDAC2 (605164) and the
FAD-binding protein BHC110 (AOF2; 609132). Other subunits of these
complexes include ZNF261 (300061), GTF2I, and polypeptides associated
with cancer-causing chromosomal translocations.

Caraveo et al. (2006) reported an unanticipated role of TFII-I outside
the nucleus as a negative regulator of agonist-induced calcium entry
that suppresses surface accumulation of TRPC3 (602345) channels.
Inhibition of agonist-induced calcium entry by TFII-I requires
phosphotyrosine residues that engage the SH2 (Src homology 2) domains of
phospholipase C-gamma (see 172420) and an uninterrupted, pleckstrin
homology-like domain that binds the split pleckstrin homology domain of
PLC-gamma. Caraveo et al. (2006) concluded that their observations
suggest a model in which TFII-I suppresses agonist-induced calcium entry
by competing with TRPC3 for binding to PLC-gamma.

Hakre et al. (2006) found endogenous mouse Gtf2i-beta was expressed in
the nucleus and was found on the c-fos (FOS; 164810) promoter in resting
fibroblasts, but it was absent from the promoter following serum
stimulation. In contrast, Gtf2i-delta was largely cytoplasmic in resting
cells, but it translocated to the nucleus upon growth factor
stimulation, bound the same site on the c-fos promoter, and activated
c-fos promoter activity. In addition, activated Gtf2i-delta interacted
with Erk1 (MAPK3; 601795)/Erk2 (MAPK1; 176948) in the cytoplasm and
imported Erk1/Erk2 to the nucleus, thereby transducing growth factor
signaling.

Mammoto et al. (2009) showed that the Rho inhibitor p190RhoGAP (GRLF1;
605277) controls capillary network formation in vitro in human
microvascular endothelial cells and retinal angiogenesis in vivo by
modulating the balance of activities between 2 antagonistic
transcription factors, TFII-I and GATA2 (137295), that govern gene
expression of the VEGF receptor VEGFR2 (191306). Moreover, this
angiogenesis signaling pathway is sensitive to extracellular matrix
elasticity as well as soluble VEGF. Mammoto et al. (2009) suggested that
this finding represented the first known functional crossantagonism
between transcription factors that controls tissue morphogenesis, and
that responds to both mechanical and chemical cues.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Perez Jurado et al. (1998) identified the GTF2I
gene at 7q11.23.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS; 194050) is a neurodevelopmental disorder
with multisystemic manifestations caused by heterozygosity for a partial
deletion of 7q11.23. The breakpoints cluster within regions located
approximately 1 cM at either side of the elastin locus (ELN; 130160).
Perez Jurado et al. (1998) characterized a duplicated region near the
common deletion breakpoints, which includes a transcribed gene. The
centromeric (C) and telomeric (T) copies are almost identical in the
duplicated 3-prime portions but diverge at the 5-prime ends. C-specific
4.3-kb mRNA and T-specific 5.4-kb mRNA are widely expressed in embryonic
and adult tissues. The telomeric gene gives rise to several tandemly
spliced forms and is deleted in all WBS individuals who have documented
ELN deletions. Database searches showed that this gene encodes BAP135, a
protein phosphorylated by BTK in B cells, as well as the multifunctional
transcription factor TFII-I; hence, the gene name GTF2I. The centromeric
gene is not deleted in WBS and appears to be a partially truncated
expressed pseudogene (GTF2IP1) with no protein product. Both loci map to
different genomic clone contigs that also contain other deleted and
nondeleted loci. The duplicated region containing GTF2I and GTF2IP1,
respectively, is located close to the deletion breakpoints and may
predispose to unequal meiotic recombination between chromosome 7
homologs and/or to intrachromosomal rearrangements. Hemizygosity for
GTF2I may also contribute to the WBS phenotype.

Most individuals with WBS have a 1.6-Mb deletion in chromosome 7q11.23
that encompasses the elastin gene (ELN; 130160), whereas most families
with autosomal dominant supravalvar aortic stenosis (SVAS; 185500) have
point mutations in ELN. The overlap of the clinical phenotypes of the 2
conditions (cardiovascular disease and connective tissue abnormalities
such as hernias) is due to the effect of haploinsufficiency of ELN. To
find other genes contributing to the Williams-Beuren syndrome phenotype,
Morris et al. (2003) studied 5 families with SVAS who had small
deletions in the WBS region. None of the families had mental
retardation, but affected family members had the WBS cognitive profile.
Although the deletions from the families nearly spanned the WBS region,
none had a deletion of FKBP6 (604836) or GTF2I, suggesting that the
mental retardation seen in WBS is associated with deletion of either the
centromeric and/or telomeric portions of the region. Comparison of these
5 families with reports of other individuals with partial deletions of
the WBS region strongly implicated GTF2I in the mental retardation of
Williams-Beuren syndrome.

Collette et al. (2009) used quantitative RT-PCR to determine the
transcriptional level of 14 WBS markers in a cohort of 77 WBS patients
and 48 controls, and observed that the parental origin of the deletion
contributed to the level of expression of GTF2I independently of age and
gender, with significantly lower expression when the single remaining
copy was located on the paternally derived chromosome (p = 0.0002).
Correlation of expression of GTF2I and some other genes in the WBS
region differed between WBS patients and controls, pointing to a
regulatory role for the GTF2I gene. Interspecies comparisons suggested
that GTF2I may play a key role in normal brain development.

Dai et al. (2009) provided a detailed genotype/phenotype analysis of a
7-year-old girl with WBS resulting from an atypical 7q11.2 deletion
(Jarvinen-Pasley et al., 2008). She had some specific features of the
disorder, including growth delay, characteristic facies, cardiovascular
involvement with pulmonic stenosis and hypertension, delayed growth, and
deficits in visual-spatial construction. However, in contrast to the
usual findings in WBS, she had normal developmental milestones,
comparatively high cognitive function, and did not have the typical
delay in language or overly social behavior. By high-resolution
oligonucleotide array CGH analysis, multicolor FISH analysis, and PCR
analysis of somatic cell hybrids, they showed that the 1.26- to 1.31-Mb
deletion included most of the genes in the interval through GTF2IRD1
(604318), but not the GTF2I gene. Neuropsychologic studies showed that
the patient had IQ scores 1 to 23 standard deviations above typical WBS
children. Dai et al. (2009) postulated that deletion of GTF2I may not
play a role in some of the physical aspects of WBS, but may play an
important role in some aspects of cognition and social behavior seen in
the disorder. Dai et al. (2009) also found no correlation between
neurocognitive performance and social behavior among 20 patients with
typical WBS, suggesting that the normal social behavior in the atypical
patient did not result from better cognition.

Mervis et al. (2012) found that patients with WBS duplication syndrome
(609757) had significantly higher levels of separation anxiety (see
607834) compared to patients with WBS and to the general population.
Using a parental assessment form with review by a psychologist, Mervis
et al. (2012) determined that 8 (29.6%) of 27 children with WBS
duplication syndrome had separation anxiety disorder compared to only 9
(4.2%) of 214 patients with WBS. The proportion of WBS duplication
patients with the disorder was also significantly higher than in the
general population (2.3%). Similar findings were obtained using a second
clinical assessment tool. Compared to mice with 1 or 2 copies of the
Gtf2i gene, transgenic mice with 3 or 4 copies of the Gtf2i gene showed
significantly increased maternal separation-induced anxiety as measured
by ultrasonic vocalizations (see ANIMAL MODEL). Mervis et al. (2012)
postulated that the role of GTF2I as a transcription factor and/or as a
regulator of intracellular calcium levels may play a role in the
molecular basis of anxiety.

POPULATION GENETICS

By analyzing short-read mapping depth for 159 human genomes, Sudmant et
al. (2010) demonstrated accurate estimation of absolute copy number for
duplications as small as 1.9 kb pairs, ranging from 0 to 48 copies.
Sudmant et al. (2010) identified 4.1 million 'singly unique nucleotide'
positions informative in distinguishing specific copies and used them to
genotype the copy and content of specific paralogs within highly
duplicated gene families. These data identified human-specific
expansions in genes associated with brain development, such as GPRIN2
(611240) and SRGAP2 (606524), which have been implicated in neurite
outgrowth and branching. Also included were the brain-specific HYDIN2
gene (610813), associated with micro- and macrocephaly; DRD5 (126453), a
dopamine D5 receptor; and the GTF2I transcription factors, whose
deletion has been associated with visual-spatial and sociability
deficits among Williams-Beuren syndrome patients, among others. The data
of Sudmant et al. (2010) also revealed extensive population genetic
diversity, especially among the genes NPEPPS (606793), UGT2B17 (601903),
and NBPF1 (610501), as well as LILRA3 (604818), which is the most highly
stratified gene by copy number in the human genome. In addition, Sudmant
et al. (2010) detected signatures consistent with gene conversion in the
human species.

ANIMAL MODEL

In mouse pups, separation anxiety can be assessed through ultrasonic
vocalizations. Mervis et al. (2012) recorded ultrasonic vocalization in
8-day-old mouse pups with 1 to 4 copies of Gtf2i during a 4-minute
separation from their mothers. Transgenic mice with 3 or 4 copies of the
Gtf2i gene showed significantly increased maternal separation-induced
anxiety compared to mice with 1 or 2 copies of the Gtf2i gene, as
measured by ultrasonic vocalizations. During the first minute, mice with
3 or 4 copies of Gtf2i produced between 100 and 120 vocalizations,
compared with approximately 50 vocalizations for mice with 2 copies and
less than 20 for mice with 1 copy.

600285	TITLE *600285 EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION TERMINATION FACTOR 1; ETF1
;;RELEASE FACTOR 1; RF1;;
ERF1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Termination of protein biosynthesis and release of the nascent
polypeptide chain are signaled by the presence of an in-frame stop codon
at the aminoacyl site of the ribosome. The process of translation
termination is universal and is mediated by protein release factors
(RFs) and GTP. A class 1 RF recognizes the stop codon and promotes the
hydrolysis of the ester bond linking the polypeptide chain with the
peptidyl site tRNA, a reaction catalyzed at the peptidyl transferase
center of the ribosome. Class 2 RFs, which are not codon specific and do
not recognize codons, stimulate class 1 RF activity and confer GTP
dependency upon the process. In prokaryotes, both class 1 RFs, RF1 and
RF2, recognize UAA; however, UAG and UGA are decoded specifically by RF1
and RF2, respectively. In eukaryotes, eRF1, or ETF1, the functional
counterpart of RF1 and RF2, functions as an omnipotent RF, decoding all
3 stop codons (Frolova et al., 1994).

CLONING

Frolova et al. (1994) characterized a family of tightly related proteins
from lower and higher eukaryotes that are structurally and functionally
similar to rabbit RF. Two of these proteins, one from human and the
other from Xenopus laevis, were expressed in yeast and Escherichia coli,
respectively, purified, and shown to be active in the in vitro RF assay.
Another protein of this family, sup45 (sup1) of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, is involved in omnipotent suppression during translation.
The amino acid sequence of the RF1 family is highly conserved. Frolova
et al. (1994) concluded that the RF1 proteins are directly implicated in
the termination of translation in eukaryotes.

GENE FUNCTION

Eukaryotic RF1 and RF3 (see GSPT1; 139259) are involved in translation
termination. In vitro, RF1 catalyzes the release of the polypeptide
chain without any stop codon specificity; the GTP-binding protein RF3
confers GTP dependence to the termination process and stimulates RF1
activity. Le Goff et al. (1997) used tRNA-mediated nonsense suppression
of different stop codons in a CAT reporter gene to analyze the
polypeptide chain release factor activities of recombinant human RF1 and
RF3 proteins overexpressed in human cells. Using a CAT assay, they
measured the competition between the suppressor tRNA and the release
factors when a stop codon was present in the ribosomal A site.
Regardless of which of the 3 stop codons was present in the CAT open
reading frame, the overexpression of RF1 alone markedly decreased
translational read-through by suppressor tRNA. Thus, Le Goff et al.
(1997) concluded that RF1 has intrinsic antisuppressor activity. The
levels of antisuppression when both RF1 and RF3 were overexpressed were
almost the same as those when RF1 was overexpressed alone, suggesting
that RF1-RF3 complex-mediated termination may be controlled by the
expression level of RF1. Overexpression of RF3 alone had an inhibitory
effect on CAT gene expression. CAT mRNA stability studies suggested that
RF3 inhibits gene expression at the transcriptional level. Le Goff et
al. (1997) suggested that RF3 may perform other functions, including the
stimulation of RF1 activity, in vivo.

Alkalaeva et al. (2006) reconstituted eukaryotic translation initiation,
elongation, and termination processes in vitro on a model mRNA encoding
a tetrapeptide followed by a UAA stop codon using individual 40S and 60S
ribosomal subunits and the complete set of individual initiation,
elongation, and release factors. They found that binding of human ERF1
and ERF3A (GSPT1) and GTP to the ribosomal pretermination complex
induced a structural rearrangement characterized by a 2-nucleotide
forward shift of the toeprint attributed to the pretermination complex.
Subsequent GTP hydrolysis was required for rapid hydrolysis of peptidyl
tRNA in the pretermination complex. Cooperativity between ERF1 and ERF3A
in ensuring fast peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis required the ERF3A-binding
C-terminal domain of ERF1.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Song et al. (2000) determined the crystal structure of ETF1 to
2.8-angstrom resolution, which, when combined with mutagenesis analyses
of the universal GGQ motif, revealed the molecular mechanism of RF
activity. The overall shape and dimensions of ETF1 resemble a tRNA
molecule, with domains 1, 2, and 3 of ETF1 corresponding to the
anticodon loop, aminoacyl acceptor stem, and T stem of a tRNA molecule,
respectively. The position of the essential GGQ motif at an exposed tip
of domain 2 suggested to the authors that the gln residue coordinates a
water molecule to mediate the hydrolytic activity at the peptidyl
transferase center. Song et al. (2000) proposed that a conserved groove
on domain 1, 80 angstroms from the GGQ motif, forms the codon
recognition site.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lai et al. (2001) determined that the ETF1 gene contains 10 exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Hansen et al. (1999) mapped the ETF1 gene
to chromosome 5q31.1. Guenet et al. (2000) confirmed the mapping of the
ETF1 gene to 5q31 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

601540	TITLE *601540 BROMODOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; BRD2
;;FEMALE STERILE HOMEOTIC-RELATED GENE 1, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; FSRG1;;
RING3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

BRD2 is a putative nuclear transcriptional regulator and a member of a
family of genes that are expressed during development.

CLONING

In a search for novel genes in the human major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) class II region on chromosome 6p21.3, Okamoto et al.
(1991) and Beck et al. (1992) identified a gene that they termed RING3.
('RING' is an acronym for 'really interesting new gene.') Based on
mapping and genomic sequencing, RING3 was located in the middle of the
class II region between the genes HLA-DNA (142930) and HLA-DMA (142855).
In contrast to all the other genes encoded in the class II region, RING3
appeared to have no obvious function associated with the immune system
based on sequence comparisons. The striking sequence similarity to the
female sterile homeotic (fsh) gene in Drosophila, however, suggested a
conserved biologic function for RING3.

Denis and Green (1996) discovered that the RING3 product is, in fact, a
mitogen-activated nuclear kinase involved in signal transduction and
that it is upregulated in certain types of leukemia.

With the aim of learning more about the phylogeny of RING3, Thorpe et
al. (1996) identified further homologs in different species and
determined their gene structures. The functional analysis of RING3 had
been further complicated by the finding of a second, non-MHC-linked copy
of RING3 in humans by Nomura et al. (1994). This was referred to by them
as ORFX (601541).

GENE FUNCTION

Dawson et al. (2011) demonstrated that I-BET151, a novel small molecule
inhibitor of the BET family, of which BRD2 is a member, has profound
efficacy against human and murine MLL-fusion leukemia cell lines through
the induction of early cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. I-BET151
treatment in 2 human leukemia cell lines with different MLL fusions
altered the expression of a common set of genes whose function may
account for these phenotypic changes. The mode of action of I-BET151 is,
at least in part, due to the inhibition of transcription at key genes
BCL2 (151430), C-MYC (190080), and CDK6 (603368) through the
displacement of BRD3/4, PAFc, and SEC components from chromatin. In vivo
studies indicated that I-BET151 has significant therapeutic value,
providing survival benefit in 2 distinct mouse models of murine MLL-AF9
and human MLL-AF4 leukemia.

610396	TITLE *610396 TRAFFICKING PROTEIN PARTICLE COMPLEX, SUBUNIT 6A; TRAPPC6A
;;TRAPP COMPLEX, SUBUNIT 6A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TRAPPC6A is a subunit of the TRAPPI and TRAPPII complexes (Gwynn et al.,
2006).

CLONING

Gwynn et al. (2006) cloned mouse Trappc6a, and they identified human
TRAPPC6A by database analysis. Mouse and human TRAPPC6A encode deduced
159-amino acid proteins that share 83% identity and have calculated
molecular masses of 17.4 kD. Both proteins contain 2 motifs conserved in
TRAPPC6B (610397) and several yeast TRAPP subunits, including Trs33, the
putative homolog of TRAPPC6A and TRAPPC6B. Northern blot analysis
detected Trappc6a expression in all mouse tissues examined, with highest
expression in kidney, liver, and testis. Expression of mouse Trappc6a
was higher in cultured melanocytes than in kidney.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gwynn et al. (2006) determined that the mouse Trappc6a gene contains 6
exons.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the
TRAPPC6A gene to chromosome 19 (TMAP RH98840). Gwynn et al. (2006)
mapped the mouse Trappc6a gene to chromosome 7.

ANIMAL MODEL

Gwynn et al. (2006) identified a recessive mutation in mice, designated
'mosaic hypopigmentation' (Mhyp), that caused mosaic loss of coat
pigmentation and patchy loss of pigmentation with abnormal melanosomes
in the retinal pigmented epithelial layer of the eye. They determined
that Mhyp resulted from integration of an 8.4-kb retrovirus into intron
1 of the Trappc6a gene.

610932	TITLE *610932 TWINFILIN, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 1; TWF1
;;PROTEIN TYROSINE KINASE 9; PTK9;;
A6 PROTEIN TYROSINE KINASE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening a human embryonic lung fibroblast bacteria expression
library with antiphosphotyrosine antibody, Beeler et al. (1994) cloned
TWF1, which they called A6. The deduced 350-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 40.3 kD. TWF1 has an N-myristoylation site
and several sites for threonine, serine, and tyrosine phosphorylation,
but it lacks a conserved protein kinase catalytic domain. Northern blot
analysis detected a 3.4-kb transcript that was highly expressed in
colon, testis, uterus, ovary, prostate, and lung. Lower expression was
detected in brain, bladder, and heart, and no expression was detected in
liver. In vitro transcription/translation resulted in a 40-kD TWF1
protein, as determined by SDS-PAGE. Southern blot analysis indicated
that TWF1 is conserved in vertebrates.

By searching databases for homologs of yeast twinfilin, Vartiainen et
al. (2000) identified mouse and human TWF1. The mouse and human TWF1
proteins contain 2 cofilin (see CFL1; 601442)-like repeats called
actin-depolymerizing factor (DSTN; 609114) homology (ADFH) domains.
Immunofluorescence microscopy localized Twf1 in a punctate perinuclear
distribution in mouse fibroblasts and neuroblastoma cells. Twf1 also
localized to globular (G)-actin (see 102610)-rich areas of the actin
cytoskeleton in fibroblasts and to filamentous (F)-actin-rich filopodia
in neuroblastoma cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Beeler et al. (1994) showed that recombinant TWF1 underwent
autophosphorylation on tyrosines and serines in an in vitro kinase
assay, and it phosphorylated exogenous substrates on tyrosines.
Recombinant TWF1 had kinase activity similar to that of recombinant
FGFR2 (176943), with optimal activity over pH 6.5 to 7.4 and a
preference for manganese over magnesium as a divalent cofactor.

In contrast to the findings of Beeler et al. (1994), Vartiainen et al.
(2000) found that recombinant mouse Twf1 lacked tyrosine kinase
activity. They showed that Twf1 bound G-actin in a 1:1 stoichiometry and
prevented F-actin assembly in a concentration-dependent manner.
Overexpression of Twf1 in mouse fibroblasts decreased the amount of
stress fibers and caused the appearance of abnormal cytoplasmic actin
filaments. In mouse fibroblasts, Twf1 colocalized with GTP-bound forms
of Cdc42 (116952) and Rac1 (602048) at membrane ruffles and cell-cell
contacts, respectively, and localization of Twf1 in these cells appeared
to be regulated by Rac1.

Paavilainen et al. (2007) showed that the N- and C-terminal ADFH domains
of mouse Twf1, which they called TWF-N and TWF-C, respectively, were
required for actin barbed-end capping. NMR and mutagenesis analyses,
together with biochemical and motility assays, showed that TWF-C bound
G-actin and interacted with the sides of F-actin like ADF and cofilins,
whereas TWF-N bound only G-actin. During filament barbed-end capping,
TWF-N interacted with the terminal actin subunit, and TWF-C bound
between 2 adjacent subunits at the side of the filament. The domain
requirement for actin filament capping by Twf1 was similar to that of
gelsolin (GSN; 137350)-type proteins, suggesting the existence of a
general barbed-end capping mechanism.

In an adaptation of loss-of-function screening to mouse models of
cancer, Meacham et al. (2009) introduced a library of shRNAs into
individual mice using transplantable E-mu-myc lymphoma cells. This
approach allowed them to screen nearly 1,000 genetic alterations in the
context of a single tumor-bearing mouse. Their experiments identified a
central role for regulators of actin dynamics and cell motility in
lymphoma cell homeostasis in vivo. Validation experiments confirmed that
these proteins represent bona fide lymphoma drug targets. Additionally,
suppression of 2 of these targets, Rac2 (602049) and twinfilin
potentiated the action of the front-line chemotherapeutic vincristine,
suggesting a critical relationship between cell motility and tumor
relapse in hematopoietic malignancies.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the TWF1
gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP RH70527).

118470	TITLE *118470 CHOLESTERYL ESTER TRANSFER PROTEIN, PLASMA; CETP
;;LIPID TRANSFER PROTEIN I
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) mediates the exchange of
lipids between lipoproteins, resulting in the net transfer of
cholesteryl ester from high density lipoprotein (HDL) to other
lipoproteins and in the subsequent uptake of cholesterol by hepatocytes
(summary by Kuivenhoven et al., 1998).

CLONING

Using a partial amino acid sequence from purified CETP, Drayna et al.
(1987) cloned and sequenced cDNA encoding CETP from a human liver
library. They used the sequenced cDNA to detect CETP mRNA in a number of
human tissues. CETP is also known as lipid transfer protein I (Day et
al., 1994).

GENE FUNCTION

Because the role of CETP in atherosclerosis remained unclear, Okamoto et
al. (2000) attempted to develop a potent, specific CETP inhibitor. One
inhibitor, JTT-705, forms a disulfide bond with CETP and increases high
density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, decreases non-HDL cholesterol,
and inhibits the progression of atherosclerosis in rabbits. These
observations suggested that CETP may be atherogenic in vivo and that
JTT-705 may be a potential antiatherogenic drug.

GENE STRUCTURE

Oliveira et al. (1996) used transgenic mice to map the cis-acting
sequences of the CETP gene. They localized a dietary cholesterol
positive response element to the interval between -370 bp and -138 bp in
the 5-prime proximal promoter region. Oliveira et al. (1996) found that
more distal 5-prime promoter regions are required for tissue-specific
expression in the liver, spleen, small intestine, adrenal gland, and
other tissues.

MAPPING

Sparkes et al. (1987) used a CETP probe against DNA from a human/mouse
somatic cell hybrid panel to assign the CETP gene to chromosome 16. In
situ hybridization of the same probe to metaphase chromosomes
regionalized the gene to 16q21. See also Lusis et al. (1987). This
contributes a new marker for chromosome 16 inasmuch as RFLPs of this
gene have been reported (Drayna and Lawn, 1987).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

For a discussion of the relationship between variation in the CETP gene
and HDL cholesterol levels, see 143470.

ANIMAL MODEL

The acceleration of atherosclerosis by polygenic (essential)
hypertension is well recognized in humans; however, the lack of an
animal model that simulates the human disease hinders elucidation of
pathogenic mechanisms. Herrera et al. (1999) reported a transgenic
atherosclerosis-polygenic hypertension model in Dahl salt-sensitive
hypertensive rats that overexpress the human cholesteryl ester transfer
protein. Male transgenic rats fed regular rat chow showed age-dependent
severe combined hyperlipidemia, atherosclerotic lesions, myocardial
infarctions, and decreased survival. These findings differed from
various mouse atherosclerosis models, demonstrating the necessity of
complex disease modeling in different species. The data demonstrated
that CETP can be proatherogenic.

To determine the relationship between apolipoprotein C-I (APOC1; 107710)
and CETP, Gautier et al. (2002) crossed transgenic mice expressing human
CETP with Apoc1 null mice. The HDLs of these crosses contained 50% less
cholesteryl esters and showed a decreased cholesteryl
ester-to-triglyceride ratio. The mean apparent diameter of LDLs from
these mice was also significantly reduced. In vitro, purified Apoc1
inhibited cholesteryl ester exchange when added to either total plasma
or to reconstituted HDL-free mixtures. Gautier et al. (2002) concluded
that APOC1 is a specific inhibitor of CETP.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPERALPHALIPOPROTEINEMIA 1
CETP, IVS14DS, G-A, +1

Using monoclonal antibodies, Brown et al. (1989) showed that 2 Japanese
sibs with markedly increased and enlarged HDL had CETP deficiency
(143470). They were homozygous for a point mutation in the 5-prime
splice donor site of intron 14 of the CETP gene. The mutation was a
change of the strictly conserved G-T intron splice donor to A-T. The
family illustrates the key role of CETP in HDL metabolism. Plasma CETP
catalyzes the transfer of cholesteryl esters from HDL to other
lipoproteins.

Inazu et al. (1990) identified the same CETP mutation in 4 additional
Japanese families with increased HDL levels, including a family reported
by Saito (1984) with unusual longevity and increased HDL levels. The
lipoprotein phenotype of CETP deficiency, which is characterized by both
increased levels of HDL and decreased levels of low density lipoprotein
(LDL), appeared to have strong antiatherogenic potential. CETP
deficiency appears to be a frequent cause of increased HDL levels in the
population of Japan, possibly because of founder effect. Familial
hypobetalipoproteinemia (107730.0006) is another antiatherogenic
mutation.

The G-to-A mutation was found in homozygous state in 2 patients by
Yamashita et al. (1990). Heterozygosity for the mutation was found in 2
other probands who totally lacked CETP and whose lipoprotein patterns
were similar to those of the 2 homozygotes. They were presumably
compound heterozygotes. Compound heterozygotes associated with
hyperalphalipoproteinemia are described in 118470.0002.

.0002
HYPERALPHALIPOPROTEINEMIA 1
CETP, ASP442GLY

Takahashi et al. (1993) reported 2 unrelated, healthy females who were
heterozygous for a G-to-A transition in exon 15 of the CETP gene,
resulting in a substitution of gly for asp at amino acid 442. Both women
had 3-fold increases in HDL concentrations and markedly decreased plasma
CETP mass and activity (HALP1; 143470), suggesting that the mutation has
dominant effects on CETP and HDL in vivo. The dominant effect of the
CETP mutation raises the possibility that the active species of CETP is
multimeric. Inazu et al. (1994) found a heterozygote frequency of 7% for
the D442G mutation in a sample of 236 Japanese men. The heterozygote
frequency of the IVS14 splice mutation (118470.0001) was estimated to be
2%. The 2 mutations accounted for about 10% of the total variance of HDL
cholesterol values in the Japanese population studied.

Akita et al. (1994) found either the IVS14 splice mutation or the D442G
mutation, or both, in 44 out of 226 unrelated patients with
hyperalphalipoproteinemia. The IVS14 mutation was found in 15 patients,
including 4 compound heterozygotes for the 2 mutations; D442G was
identified in 33, including the 4 compound heterozygotes. Allelic
frequencies in the general population for the IVS14 and the D442G
mutations were 0.81% and 4.62%, respectively. The IVS14 mutation was
responsible for a more severe form of hyperalphalipoproteinemia.

Among 117 Japanese subjects with hyperalphalipoproteinemia without the
intron 14 splice defect, Sakai et al. (1995) found 3 homozygotes (2.5%)
and 34 heterozygotes (29.1%) for the D442G mutation. These results
suggested that this mutation is as common as the intron 14 splice defect
in Japanese hyperalphalipoproteinemic subjects. One of the homozygotes
was the patient previously described by Takahashi et al. (1993) as
having hyperalphalipoproteinemia with corneal opacity and coronary heart
disease. They had previously thought that this patient was heterozygous.

.0003
HYPERALPHALIPOPROTEINEMIA 1
CETP, 1-BP INS, T, IVS14, +3

Inazu et al. (1994) screened Japanese subjects with high density
lipoprotein cholesterol levels in excess of 100 mg/dl (143470) by PCR
single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of the CETP gene. They
found a novel intron 14 splice donor site mutation caused by a T
insertion at position +3 from the exon 14/intron 14 boundary. The
phenotype of a genetic compound heterozygote for this mutation and the
IVS14 splice mutation (118470.0001) was similar to that of the
homozygote for the latter mutation: no detectable CETP and markedly
increased HDL cholesterol levels (see 143470).

CETP, ILE405VAL

Barzilai et al. (2003) performed a case-control study of 213 Ashkenazi
Jewish probands with exceptional longevity (mean age, 98.2 years) and
their 216 offspring (mean age, 68.3 years) with an age-matched group of
258 Ashkenazi Jews and 589 participants from the Framingham Offspring
Study as controls. They found that high density lipoprotein (HDL) and
low density lipoprotein (LDL) particle sizes were significantly higher
(143470) in probands compared with both control groups (P of 0.001 for
both), independent of plasma levels of HDL and LDL cholesterol and
apolipoproteins A-I (107680) and B (107730). This phenotype was also
typical of the probands' offspring, but not of the age-matched controls.
The HDL and LDL particle sizes were significantly larger in offspring
and controls without hypertension or cardiovascular disease.
Furthermore, lipoprotein particle sizes, but not plasma LDL levels, were
significantly higher in offspring and controls without the metabolic
syndrome. Probands and offspring had a 2.9- and 3.6-fold (in men) and
2.7- and 1.5-fold (in women) increased frequency, respectively, of
homozygosity for the val405 allele (VV genotype) of an ile405-to-val
(I405V; dbSNP rs5882) polymorphism in the CETP gene, respectively,
compared with controls. Probands with the VV genotype had increased
lipoprotein sizes and lower serum CETP concentrations. The findings
suggested that lipoprotein particle sizes are heritable and promote a
healthy aging phenotype.

Among 158 Ashkenazi Jewish individuals aged 95 to 107 years, Barzilai et
al. (2006) found that the val405 allele was significantly associated
with preserved cognitive function. Those with the V/V genotype were
twice as likely to have good cognitive function compared to those with
the I/I genotype. The findings were replicated in a second group of 173
individuals. The results also showed a link between better cognitive
function and low CETP levels, higher HDL cholesterol levels, and larger
lipoprotein size.

Sanders et al. (2010) performed a prospective cohort study of 523
community-dwelling adults without dementia aged 70 years or older.
Standardized neuropsychologic and neurologic measures were administered
annually from 1994 to 2009. Linear mixed-effects models adjusted for
sex, education, race, medical comorbidities, and APOE4 examined
associations of the val405 genotype with longitudinal performance on
cognitive tests of episodic memory, attention, and psychomotor speed.
The V405 genotype was the main predictor of incident dementia or
Alzheimer disease in similarly adjusted Cox proportional hazards models
with age as the time scale. The V405 allele frequency was 43.5%, and a
total of 40 cases of incident dementia occurred during follow-up.
Compared with isoleucine homozygotes, valine homozygotes had
significantly slower memory decline on the Free and Cued Selective
Reminding Test (0.43 points per year of age for isoleucine; 95% CI,
-0.58 to 0.29 vs. 0.21 points per year of age for valine; 95% CI, -0.39
to 0.04; difference in linear age slope, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.41; P =
0.03) and no significant differences on the Digit Span or Digit Symbol
Substitution tests. Valine homozygotes also had a lower risk of dementia
(hazard ratio, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.10-0.85; P - 0.02) and Alzheimer disease
(hazard ratio, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.10-0.95; P = 0.04). Sanders et al. (2010)
concluded that their preliminary report suggests that CETP V405 valine
homozygosity is associated with slower memory decline and lower incident
dementia and Alzheimer disease risk, and supports the observations of
Barzilai et al. (2006).

CETP, C-T

In an association study of 7 HDL metabolism genes in participants in the
Dallas Heart Study and in 849 African American men and women from
Maywood, IL, Spirin et al. (2007) identified a SNP of the CETP gene,
dbSNP rs183130, that was associated with incremental changes in HDL
cholesterol levels (143470) in 3 independent samples. This SNP achieved
a P value of 4.73 x 10(-12) in analysis of covariance in the entire
sample in a model that included race, sex, age, and body mass index
(BMI). The C allele was associated with lowering of HDL cholesterol.

603234	TITLE *603234 ATP-BINDING CASSETTE, SUBFAMILY C, MEMBER 6; ABCC6
;;ANTHRACYCLINE RESISTANCE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; ARA;;
MULTIDRUG RESISTANCE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 6; MRP6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ABCC6 belongs to the multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP)
subfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transmembrane transporters. MRPs
are involved in drug resistance, particularly in association with cancer
chemotherapy. Mutations in the ABCC6 gene cause pseudoxanthoma elasticum
(PXE; see 264800), a heritable connective tissue disorder characterized
by calcification of elastic fibers in skin, arteries, and retina (Bergen
et al., 2000; Le Saux et al., 2000; Ringpfeil et al., 2000).

CLONING

Multidrug resistance in cancer cells has been attributed to the
overexpression of certain membrane proteins, several of which are
members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily. Examples include
MRP (158343) and MDR1 (171050). Longhurst et al. (1996) screened an
E1000 leukemia cell cDNA library using an MRP probe. They cloned a novel
cDNA encoding a 453-amino acid polypeptide that was similar to the
C-terminal half of MRP. Whereas MRP contains 2 ABC domains and 12
transmembrane domains, the ARA protein contains 1 ABC domain and 5
transmembrane domains. Northern blot analysis showed that ARA was
expressed as a 2.2-kb mRNA in an E1000 leukemia cell line, but not in
the untransformed parental CEM cell line. Southern blot analysis
revealed that, like MRP, the ARA gene was amplified in the genomic DNA
of the E1000 cell line. The ABCC6 protein consists of 1,503 amino acids
with a molecular mass of 165 kD, is located in the plasma membrane, and
probably has 17 membrane-spanning helices grouped into 3 transmembrane
domains (Le Saux et al., 2000). The 4.5-kb ABCC6 mRNA is expressed in
several secretory tissues, but primarily in kidney and liver. By RT-PCR
analysis using RNA isolated from tissues frequently affected by PXE,
Bergen et al. (2000) detected expression of ABCC6 in retina, skin, and
vascular tissue, although the highest level of expression was in the
liver.

By Western blot analysis of transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)
cells, Belinsky et al. (2002) found that MRP6 migrated at the predicted
molecular mass of about 152 kD and at 182 kD, which likely represents a
glycosylated form.

Sinko et al. (2003) found that human ABCC6, when expressed by retroviral
transduction in polarized mammalian cells (MDCKII), is exclusively
localized to the basolateral membrane. In contrast to the in vitro
translated protein, ABCC6 was glycosylated in MDCK cells. Limited
proteolysis of the fully glycosylated and underglycosylated forms,
followed by immunodetection with region-specific antibodies, indicated
that asn15, located in the extracellular N-terminal region of ABCC6, is
the only N-glycosylated site in the protein.

By in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analysis, Beck et al.
(2005) detected ABCC6 mRNA and protein in a wide range of epithelial
cells of exocrine and endocrine tissues such as acinar cells in the
pancreas, mucosal cells of the intestine, and follicular epithelial
cells of the thyroid. Enteroendocrine G cells of the stomach showed
strong immunostaining. In addition, ABCC6 mRNA and protein were present
in most neurons of the brain, in alveolar macrophages in the lung, in
lymph node lymphocytes, in hepatocytes, and in keratinocytes and
epithelial cells of the ducts of sweat glands.

Using PCR, Matsuzaki et al. (2005) found that Abcc6 expression was
highest in mouse liver and lower in kidney and small intestine.
Second-round nested PCR revealed much weaker expression in brain,
tongue, stomach, and eye. Subcloning and sequencing of distinct PCR
products indicated that the 3-prime end is subject to aberrant splicing,
resulting in each case in a premature termination codon. PCR analysis of
cultured human cells revealed similar splice variations in the 3-prime
end resulting in the skipping of exons 24 and 30 in epidermal
keratinocytes, and exons 24, 26, and 28 in dermal fibroblasts. In
fibroblasts, a minor PCR product represented alternative splicing of
exon 7.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kool et al. (1999) determined that the human ABCC6 gene comprises 31
exons.

Ratajewski et al. (2008) found that the 5-prime upstream region of the
ABCC6 gene contains a major Alu element of over 4.5 kb.

GENE FUNCTION

Belinsky and Kruh (1999) and Klein et al. (1999) suggested that ABCC6
function may be related to cellular detoxification rather than drug
resistance. Bergen et al. (2000) commented that the molecules presumably
transported by ABCC6 may be essential for extracellular matrix
deposition or turnover of connective tissue at specific sites in the
body. Given the high expression of ABCC6 in liver and kidney, ABCC6
substrates may be transported into the blood. A deficiency of specific
ABCC6 substrates may affect a range of connective tissue sites
throughout the body and specifically elastic fiber assembly.

By assaying membrane vesicles obtained from ABCC6-expressing insect
cells, Ilias et al. (2002) found ABCC6 specifically bound MgATP and
actively transported glutathione conjugates, including leukotriene-C4
and N-ethylmaleimide S-glutathione (NEM-GS), in an MgATP-dependent
manner. 17-Beta-estradiol-17-beta-D-glucuronide was a weak transport
substrate. The organic anions probenecid, benzbromarone, and
indomethacin specifically inhibited ABCC6-mediated NEM-GS transport, and
orthovanadate, a phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, completely
inhibited NEM-GS transport.

Using similar substrates, Belinsky et al. (2002) found that MRP6
expressed in CHO cell membranes could transport glutathione conjugates
but not glucuronate conjugates. Transfected cells also showed enhanced
resistance to several anticancer agents. The highest levels of
resistance were observed for the inhibitors of topoisomerase II (126430)
etoposide and teniposide, followed by the anthracyclines doxorubicin and
daunorubicin. MRP6-expressing CHO cells accumulated less etoposide
compared with control transfected cells, indicating that MRP6 functions
as a drug efflux pump.

Using a luciferase reporter gene construct, Jiang et al. (2006) examined
the 2.6-kb human ABCC6 promoter. An NF-kappa-B (see NFKB1, 164011)-like
sequence conferred strong expression in HepG2 hepatoma cells, but much
weaker expression in cell lines of other tissue origin. Injection of the
construct into mouse tail vein confirmed liver-specific expression.
Testing of selected cytokines revealed that TGF-beta (190180)
upregulated, while TNF-alpha (191160) and interferon-gamma (IFNG;
147570) downregulated, the promoter activity in HepG2 cells. The
responsiveness to TGF-beta resided primarily within an SP1 (189906)/SP3
(601804) binding site. The expression of the ABCC6 promoter was markedly
enhanced by SP1. Jiang et al. (2006) concluded that the expression of
ABCC6 can be modulated by proinflammatory cytokines.

Using the ABCC6 promoter region in reporter gene assays in the HepG2
hepatoma cell line, Ratajewski et al. (2006) showed that all-trans
retinoic acid caused significant induction of ABCC6 activity. They found
9-cis retinoic acid (9cRA), a specific RXR (see RXRA, 180245) receptor
agonist, induced the ABCC6 promoter in a concentration-dependent manner.
9cRA also induced the expression of endogenous ABCC6 in HepG2 cells. The
binding of RXR to the endogenous ABCC6 promoter was confirmed by
chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments. Occupancy of the ABCC6
promoter by RXR was relatively high in unstimulated cells and increased
further in 9cRA-treated cells.

Using the ABCC6 reporter construct described by Ratajewski et al. (2006)
in a screen for ABCC6-regulating factors, Ratajewski et al. (2008) found
that GATA3 (131320) repressed ABCC6 activity, and that SP1, PLAG1
(603026), and PLAGL1 (603044) induced ABCC6 activity. They identified 2
putative PLAG-binding sites on the reverse strand of the ABCC6 proximal
promoter. Reporter gene assays, electrophoretic mobility shift assays,
and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that the more proximal
site was bound and activated by PLAG1 and PLAGL1. Furthermore,
overexpression of PLAG1 resulted in enhanced ABCC6 transcription in
transfected human embryonic kidney cells.

MAPPING

Kuss et al. (1998) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to map the
ARA gene to human chromosome 16p13.1. The gene order in this region is
telomere--MYH11(160745)--MRP--ARA--centromere. The MRP and ARA genes are
located within 9 kb of each other and are transcribed in opposite
directions. Both MRP and ARA are deleted in a subgroup of inv(16)
leukemias, and both are expressed in normal hematopoietic precursor
cells.

- Pseudogenes

Pulkkinen et al. (2001) identified 2 pseudogenes containing sequences
highly homologous to the 5-prime end of the ABCC6 gene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum

Simultaneously and independently, Bergen et al. (2000), Le Saux et al.
(2000), and Ringpfeil et al. (2000) identified missense, nonsense, and
splice site mutations as well as deletions and insertions in the ABCC6
gene accounting for pseudoxanthoma elasticum (264800). Mutations
appeared to represent autosomal recessive (Le Saux et al., 2000) and
autosomal dominant (177850) (Bergen et al., 2000) modes of inheritance,
and sporadic cases. By SSCP and heteroduplex analysis using genetic DNA
from a cohort of 17 unrelated PXE patients, Le Saux et al. (2000)
screened 109 exons within 5 PXE candidate genes in the chromosome
16p13.1 region for mutations. By screening the 31 exons of ABCC6 by
SSCP, Le Saux et al. (2000) identified 6 mutations that were responsible
for PXE in 10 of 17 patients. They identified a C-to-T substitution
within exon 24 at nucleotide 3421, resulting in an arg-to-stop
substitution at codon 1141 (R1141X; 603234.0001) in 6 unrelated families
with autosomal recessive PXE. Bergen et al. (2000) identified mutations
in ABCC6 causing autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and sporadic
PXE. Bergen et al. (2000) found the R114X mutation in 2 families with
autosomal dominant PXE. One patient had a large de novo deletion of
chromosome 16 (603234.0010). Ringpfeil et al. (2000) reported a total of
8 pathogenetic mutations in the ABCC6 gene in 8 kindreds with PXE. They
referred to the gene as MRP6 (multidrug resistance-associated
protein-6). Examination of clinically unaffected family members in 4
multiplex families identified heterozygous carriers, consistent with an
autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.

Le Saux et al. (2001) performed a mutation analysis of the ABCC6 gene in
122 unrelated patients with PXE, the largest cohort of patients studied
to that time. They characterized 36 mutations, 28 of which were novel.
Twenty-one were missense variants, 6 were small insertions or deletions,
5 were nonsense, 2 were alleles likely to result in aberrant mRNA
splicing, and 2 were large deletions involving ABCC6. Although most
mutations appeared to be unique variants, 2 disease-causing alleles
occurred frequently in apparently unrelated individuals. Arg1141 to ter
(R1141X; 603234.0001) was found in this patient cohort at a frequency of
18.8% and was preponderant in European patients. Deletion of nucleotides
23-29 (603234.0016) occurred at a frequency of 12.9% and was prevalent
in patients from the United States. Putative disease-causing mutations
were identified in approximately 64% of the 244 chromosomes studied, and
85.2% of the 122 patients were found to have at least 1 disease-causing
allele. The results suggested that a fraction of the undetected mutant
alleles could be either genomic rearrangements or mutations occurring in
noncoding regions of the ABCC6 gene. A cluster of disease-causing
variants was observed within exons encoding a large C-terminal
cytoplasmic loop and in the C-terminal nucleotide-binding domain.

While implementing a strategy to screen for PXE by complete mutation
analysis of the ABCC6 gene, Germain (2001) found evidence for the
existence of at least 1 pseudogene highly homologous to the 5-prime end
of ABCC6. Sequence variants in this ABCC6-like pseudogene could be
mistaken for mutations in the ABCC6 gene and consequently lead to
erroneous genotyping results in pedigrees affected with PXE.

Germain et al. (2001) identified a heterozygous missense mutation in
exon 7 of the ABCC6 gene in a female PXE patient whose parents were
second cousins. Despite complete scanning of the gene, no further
mutation was evident. A heterozygous profile was also found in the
proband's unaffected children. However, haplotype homozygosity was
confirmed at chromosome 16p13.1, using both extragenic microsatellites
and intragenic polymorphisms located 3-prime from the mutation, in
agreement with the known consanguinity in the family. Taken together,
the data indicated that PCR products of exon 7 of the ABCC6 gene were
amplified from more than 2 genomic copies. This supported the existence
of one or more ABCC6 pseudogenes highly homologous to the 5-prime end
(exons 1-9) of the ABCC6 gene.

Pulkkinen et al. (2001) identified 2 pseudogenes containing sequences
highly homologous to the 5-prime end of the ABCC6 gene. Nucleotide
differences in flanking introns between these 2 pseudogenes and ABCC6
allowed them to design allele-specific primers that eliminated the
amplification of both pseudogene sequences by PCR and provided reliable
amplification of ABCC6-specific sequences only. The use of
allele-specific PCR revealed 2 novel 5-prime-end PXE mutations.

In 59 unrelated Dutch patients with PXE, Hu et al. (2003) identified 17
different mutations, including 11 novel mutations, in the ABCC6 gene in
65 alleles. The R1141X mutation was by far the most common mutation,
identified in 19 (32.2%) patients; the second most common mutation,
which results in the deletion of exons 23-29 (603234.0014), was
identified in 11 (18.6%) patients. In 20 patients, only 1 mutation in 1
allele was detected. Combined with previous mutation data, Hu et al.
(2003) concluded that approximately 80% of the PXE mutations occur in
the cytoplasmic domains of the predicted ABCC6 protein, especially the 2
nucleotide-binding fold (NBF) domains (NBF1 and NBF2) and the eighth
cytoplasmic loop between the fifteenth and sixteenth transmembrane
regions.

Hu et al. (2004) described an efficient molecular diagnostic strategy
for ABCC6 in PXE. The 2 most frequent mutations, R1141X (603234.0001)
and deletion of exons 23 through 29 (603234.0016), as well as a core set
of mutations, were identified by restriction enzyme digestion and size
separation on agarose gels. In the remaining patient group in which only
1 or no mutant allele was found, the complete coding sequence was
analyzed using DHPLC. All variations found were confirmed by direct DNA
sequencing. Finally, Southern blot was used to investigate the potential
presence of small or large deletions. Twenty different mutations,
including 2 novel mutations in the ABCC6 gene, were identified in 80.3%
of the 76 patients, and 58.6% of the 152 ABCC6 alleles analyzed.

Chassaing et al. (2005) commented that mutations had been identified in
PXE in most of the 31 ABCC6 exons and that no correlation between the
nature or the location of the mutations and phenotype severity had been
established.

Trip et al. (2002), Van Soest et al. (1997), and Bacchelli et al. (1999)
emphasized the carriage of a sole ABCC6 mutation as a cardiovascular
risk factor. Sherer et al. (2001) described limited phenotypic
expression of PXE in parents of affected offspring.

Miksch et al. (2005) performed a mutation screen in ABCC6 using
haplotype analysis in conjunction with direct sequencing to achieve a
mutation detection rate of 97%. Their mutational analysis confirmed an
earlier haplotype-based analysis and conclusions regarding a
recessive-only mode of inheritance in PXE (Cai et al., 2000) through the
identification of 2 mutated alleles in all individuals with PXE who
appear in either consecutive or alternating generations of the same
family. Their study demonstrated that the full phenotypic expression of
the disorder requires 2 defective allelic copies of ABCC6 and that
pseudodominance is the mode of transmission in presumed autosomal
dominant families (i.e., the second parental disease allele 'marries
into' the family). The apparent frequency of this mechanism was
approximately 7.5% in their family cohort. Miksch et al. (2005) stated
that in their families no heterozygote for a large deletion showed any
apparent clinical sign of PXE according to category I diagnostic
criteria.

Chassaing et al. (2005) provided a comprehensive catalog of ABCC6
mutations identified in PXE.

Pfendner et al. (2007) collected mutation data on an international case
series of 270 patients with PXE (239 probands, 31 affected family
members). In 134 patients with a known phenotype and both mutations
identified, genotype-phenotype correlations were assessed. In total, 316
mutant alleles in ABCC6, including 39 novel mutations, were identified
in 239 probands. Mutations clustered in exons 24 and 28, corresponding
to the second nucleotide-binding fold and the last intracellular domain
of the protein. Together with the recurrent R1141X (603234.0001) and
del23-29 (603234.0016) mutations, these mutations accounted for 71.5% of
the total individual mutations identified. Genotype-phenotype analysis
failed to reveal a significant correlation between the type of mutations
identified or their predicted effect on the expression of the protein
and the age of onset and severity of the disease.

Using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) to analyze
35 PXE patients with incomplete ABCC6 genotypes after exonic sequencing,
Costrop et al. (2010) identified 6 multiexon deletions and 4 single-exon
deletions and were thus able to characterized 25% of the unidentified
disease alleles. The findings illustrated the instability of the ABCC6
genomic region and stressed the importance of screening for deletions in
the molecular diagnosis of PXE.

- Generalized Arterial Calcification of Infancy 2

In a 28-year-old French man with PXE, who had a younger brother who died
of generalized arterial calcification of infancy (GACI1; 614473) at age
15 months, Le Boulanger et al. (2010) identified compound heterozygosity
for missense mutations in the ABCC6 gene (603234.0025 and 603234.0026),
which were also found in heterozygosity in each of his unaffected
parents, respectively. No disease-causing mutations were found in the
known GACI1 (208000)-related gene, ENPP1 (173335). Although no DNA
material was available from the deceased younger brother, his disease
was presumed to be related to the familial ABCC6 mutations. Le Boulanger
et al. (2010) concluded that GACI may represent an atypical and severe
end of the vascular phenotypic spectrum of PXE.

Nitschke et al. (2012) analyzed the ABCC6 gene in 28 GACI patients from
25 unrelated families who were negative for mutation in the ENNP1 gene,
as well as 2 unrelated GACI patients in whom only 1 ENNP1 mutation had
been detected. They identified homozygosity or compound heterozygosity
for mutations in ABCC6 in 8 unrelated GACI patients (see, e.g.,
603234.0001, 603234.0006, and 603234.0027-603234.0029). In 6 patients
from 5 unrelated families, only 1 mutation was detected in ABCC6; the
authors noted that there was no phenotypic difference between these
patients and those with biallelic mutations in ABCC6, and stated that
mutations in regulatory untranslated regions of ABCC6 might not have
been detected by their approach. No mutation in the ABCC6 gene was found
in 16 patients from 14 unrelated families, including the 2 patients who
were known to carry monoallelic mutations in ENNP1. Overall, 13
different ABCC6 mutations were identified in GACI patients, all but 2 of
which had been previously identified in typical PXE patients who had a
much milder phenotype than the GACI patients. Based on the considerable
overlap of phenotype and genotype of GACI and pseudoxanthoma elasticum,
Nitschke et al. (2012) suggested that GACI and PXE represent 2 ends of a
clinical spectrum of ectopic calcification and other organ pathologies
rather than 2 distinct disorders.

POPULATION GENETICS

The Afrikaner population of South Africa is of Dutch, German, and French
Huguenot descent and has its origin in the first European immigrant
settlements at the Cape of Good Hope during the 17th century. Torrington
and Viljoen (1991) proposed that the basis for the high prevalence of
PXE in the Afrikaner population is a founder effect. An initial
genealogic study traced the ancestry of 20 Afrikaner families with PXE
back to potentially only 4 individuals, suggesting that this disorder is
most likely derived from these original founders in South Africa. To
further study this possibility, Le Saux et al. (2002) performed
haplotype and mutation analyses in 17 of the 20 originally analyzed
Afrikaner families, and identified 3 common haplotypes and 6 different
disease-causing variants. Three of these mutant alleles were missense
variants, 2 were nonsense mutations, and 1 was a single-basepair
insertion. The most common variant, arg1339 to cys (R1339C;
603234.0017), accounted for 53% of the PXE alleles, whereas other mutant
alleles appeared at lower frequencies ranging from 3 to 12%. Haplotype
analysis of the Afrikaner families showed that the 3 most frequent
mutations were identical by descent, indicating a founder origin of PXE
in this population.

Chassaing et al. (2005) suggested that the proposed prevalence of PXE of
1 in 25,000 may be an underestimation. Consequently, the prevalence of
heterozygous carriers, and the prevalence of different organ involvement
in carriers of 1 or 2 ABCC6 mutations, are not precisely known.

PATHOGENESIS

Since the ABCC6 gene is expressed primarily, if not exclusively, in the
liver and kidneys, Ringpfeil et al. (2001) suggested that PXE is a
primary metabolic disorder with secondary involvement of elastic fibers,
a situation comparable to the secondary involvement of connective tissue
elements in homocystinuria (236200) and alkaptonuria (203500).

ABCC6 is a member of the large ATP-dependent transmembrane transporter
family. Chassaing et al. (2005) commented that the association of PXE to
ABCC6 efflux transport alterations raised a number of pathophysiology
hypotheses, among them, the idea that PXE is a systemic metabolic
disease resulting from lack or accumulation over time in the bloodstream
of molecules interacting with the synthesis, turnover, and/or
maintenance of extracellular matrix (ECM).

Since ABCC6 is expressed primarily in the liver, Jiang and Uitto (2006)
likewise supported the notion that PXE is a metabolic disease.

In an investigation of the functional relationship between ABCC6
deficiency and elastic fiber calcification, Le Saux et al. (2006)
speculated that ABCC6 deficiency in PXE patients induces a persistent
imbalance in circulating metabolite(s) which impairs the synthetic
abilities of normal elastoblasts or specifically alters elastic fiber
assembly. They found that PXE fibroblasts cultured with normal human
serum expressed and deposited increased amounts of proteins, but
structurally normal elastic fibers. Normal and PXE fibroblasts as well
as normal smooth muscle cells deposited abnormal aggregates of elastic
fibers when maintained in the presence of serum from PXE patients. The
expression of tropoelastin (see 130160) and other elastic
fiber-associated genes was not significantly modulated by the presence
of PXE serum. These results indicated that certain metabolites present
in PXE sera interfered with the normal assembly of elastic fibers in
vitro and suggested that PXE is a primary metabolic disorder with
secondary connective tissue manifestations.

ANIMAL MODEL

To elucidate the pathogenesis of PXE, Klement et al. (2005) generated a
transgenic mouse by targeted ablation of the mouse Abcc6 gene.
Abcc6-null mice were negative for expression of Mrp6 in the liver, and
necropsies revealed profound mineralization of several tissues including
skin, arterial blood vessels, and retina, while heterozygous animals
were indistinguishable from the wildtype mice. Particularly striking was
the mineralization of vibrissae, as confirmed by von Kossa and alizarin
red stains. Electron microscopy revealed mineralization affecting both
elastic structures and collagen fibers. Mineralization of vibrissae was
noted as early as 5 weeks of age and was progressive with age in Abcc6
-/- mice but was not observed in heterozygous or wildtype mice up to 2
years of age. Total body computerized tomography scan of Abcc6 -/- mice
showed mineralization in skin and subcutaneous tissue as well as in
kidneys. These data demonstrated aberrant mineralization of soft tissues
in PXE-affected organs, and consequently, these mice recapitulated
features of this complex disease.

Gorgels et al. (2005) generated Abcc6 -/- mice and showed by light and
electron microscopy that Abcc6 -/- mice spontaneously developed
calcification of elastic fibers in blood vessel walls and in Bruch
membrane in the eye. No clear abnormalities were seen in the dermal
extracellular matrix. Calcification of blood vessels was most prominent
in small arteries in the cortex of the kidney, but in old mice, it
occurred also in other organs and in the aorta and vena cava. Monoclonal
antibodies against mouse Abcc6 localized the protein to the basolateral
membranes of hepatocytes and the basal membrane in renal proximal
tubules, but failed to show the protein at the pathogenic sites. Abcc6
-/- mice developed a 25% reduction in plasma HDL cholesterol and an
increase in plasma creatinine levels, which may be due to impaired
kidney function. No changes in serum mineral balance were found. Gorgels
et al. (2005) concluded that the phenotype of the Abcc6 -/- mouse shares
calcification of elastic fibers with human PXE pathology, and supports
the hypothesis that PXE is a systemic disease.

To characterize the mineralization process in PXE, Jiang et al. (2007)
examined a PXE animal model, the Abcc6 -/- mouse, with respect to
specific proteins serving as inhibitors of mineralization. The levels of
calcium and phosphate in serum of these mice were normal, but the Abcc6
-/- serum had less ability to prevent the mineral deposition induced by
inorganic phosphate in a cell culture system. Addition of fetuin-A
(138680) to the culture system prevented the mineralization. The
calcium-phosphate product was markedly elevated in the mineralized
vibrissae of Abcc6 -/- mice, an early biomarker of the mineralization
process, consistent with histopathologic findings. Levels of fetuin-A
were slightly decreased in Abcc6 -/- serum, and positive immunostaining
for matrix-Gla-protein (MGP; 154870), fetuin-A, and ankylosis protein
(ANK; 605145) as well as alkaline phosphatase activity were strongly
associated with the mineralization process. In situ hybridization
demonstrated that the genes for MGP and Ank were expressed locally in
vibrissae, whereas fetuin-A was expressed highly in the liver. These
data suggested that the deposition of the bone-associated proteins
spatially coincides with mineralization and actively regulates this
process locally and systemically.

In the Dyscalc1 mouse model of dystrophic cardiac calcification (DCC),
Meng et al. (2007) studied 2 intercrosses and identified Abcc6 as the
causative gene, which was confirmed by transgenic complementation. The
authors noted that myocardial calcification has not been reported as a
phenotype associated with human PXE or mouse Abcc6-knockout models.

In all mouse strains positive for DCC, Aherrahrou et al. (2008)
identified a missense mutation at the 3-prime border of exon 14 of the
Abcc6 gene that created an additional donor splice site. The alternative
transcript lacked the last 5 nucleotides of exon 14, resulting in
premature termination at codon 684, and leading to Abcc6 protein
deficiency in DCC-susceptible mice.

Jiang et al. (2009) found that grafting of wildtype mouse muzzle skin
onto the back of Abcc6-knockout mice resulted in abnormal mineralization
of vibrissae consistent with PXE, whereas grafting of Abcc6-knockout
mouse muzzle skin onto wildtype mice did not. The data implied that PXE
does not result from localized defect based on resident cellular
abnormalities but from a change of metabolite(s) in serum. These
findings implicate circulatory factors as a critical component of the
mineralization process and supported the notion that PXE is a secondary
mineralization of connective tissues. In addition, the findings
suggested that the abnormal mineralization process could possibly be
countered or even reversed by changes in the homeostatic milieu.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PSEUDOXANTHOMA ELASTICUM
ARTERIAL CALCIFICATION, GENERALIZED, OF INFANCY, 2, INCLUDED
ABCC6, ARG1141TER

---Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum

In a large consanguineous Italian family segregating autosomal recessive
pseudoxanthoma elasticum (264800), Le Saux et al. (2000) identified a
C-to-T transition at nucleotide 3421 in exon 24 of the ABCC6 gene,
resulting in an arg-to-ter substitution at codon 1141 (R1141X). All
unaffected individuals but 1 were heterozygous carriers; affected
individuals were homozygous for this mutation. This variant was not
found in the control panel of 200 normal alleles and cosegregated in
homozygous or compound heterozygous state with the PXE phenotype in
families. This mutation was also identified in 5 unrelated pedigrees.
R1141X was found in homozygous state in unrelated patients with
autosomal recessive PXE from the United Kingdom and Belgium. Haplotype
analysis of the PXE locus in families with the R1141X mutation revealed
that this mutation was segregating with different haplotypes, suggesting
that R1141X may be a recurrent mutation in ABCC6. Testing of cultured
skin fibroblasts showed no ABCC6 mRNA in patients carrying the R1141X
mutation from the large Italian pedigree.

Bergen et al. (2000) identified this mutation in 2 families segregating
autosomal dominant PXE (177850).

In a family in which 2 brothers and a sister had PXE, Ringpfeil et al.
(2000) demonstrated that the affected individuals were compound
heterozygotes for the R1141X mutation and an R1268Q mutation
(603234.0011).

In a cohort of 101 unrelated patients with PXE, Le Saux et al. (2001)
found that the R1141X mutant allele was present in 28.4% of European
alleles and only 4.1% of U.S. alleles. Also, this nonsense mutation was
unequally distributed among European countries. The frequency of
homozygotes was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the European
population.

Hu et al. (2003) demonstrated a founder effect for the R1141X mutation
in the Netherlands. They identified the mutation in 19 alleles in 16
Dutch patients with PXE, in heterozygous, homozygous, or compound
heterozygous form. Expression of the normal allele in heterozygotes was
predominant; no or very low expression was found in homozygotes. The
mutation induced instability of the aberrant mRNA. Hu et al. (2003)
suggested that the PXE phenotype of the R1141X mutation most likely
results from complete loss of function or functional haploinsufficiency
of ABCC6.

In the study of Trip et al. (2002), the presence of a single R1141X
mutation in ABCC6 appeared to be an independent risk factor for coronary
heart disease in young people.

---Generalized Arterial Calcification of Infancy 2

In 2 patients with generalized arterial calcification of infancy-2
(GACI2; 614473), Nitschke et al. (2012) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the ABCC6 gene. A French female infant
with GACI who died at 6 weeks of age, who had calcification of the
coronary arteries and other arteries, severe hypertension, and heart
failure, was compound heterozygous for R1141X and R1314W (603234.0006).
A 3-year-old Spanish boy with GACI who had calcification of the splenic
and pancreatic arteries, nephrocalcinosis, severe hypertension,
cardiomegaly, psychomotor retardation, and abdominal distention, was
compound heterozygous for R1141X and R518X (603234.0027).

---Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum, Forme Fruste, Digenic, ABCC6/GGCX

In a woman and her sister with biopsy-confirmed PXE, Li et al. (2009)
identified compound heterozygosity for the R1141X mutation and a
mutation in the GGCX gene (V255M; 137167.0012). Neither had evidence of
a coagulopathy and the skin phenotype was mild (see 177850), but skin
biopsies showed undercarboxylated matrix gla proteins (MGP; 154870) in
the areas of abnormal mineralization. Since R1141X in the heterozygous
state is usually not associated with clinical features, the findings
suggested that the women had digenic inheritance of PXE. In contrast, 2
other family members who were compound heterozygous for R1141X and
another mutation in the GGCX gene (S300F; 137167.0013) had no signs of
either disorder on clinical exam but refused further clinical testing.
Plasma levels of undercarboxylated total MGP of the 2 clinically
unaffected individuals were at the lower end of normal. Although the
reasons for the lack of clinical findings in the 2 unaffected family
members remained unclear, Li et al. (2009) concluded that
undercarboxylation of MGP plays a critical role in aberrant
mineralization of tissues in PXE.

.0002
PSEUDOXANTHOMA ELASTICUM
ABCC6, IVS21, G-T, +1

In patients with autosomal recessive pseudoxanthoma elasticum (264800)
from 2 families, Le Saux et al. (2000) found that affected individuals
carried a G-to-T transversion at the +1 position of intron 21 of the
ABCC6 gene, affecting the donor splice site. One of the families was
from the U.K., and the other was from the United States. The family from
the U.K. carried the R1141X mutation (603234.0001) on the other allele;
in the American family, the other mutation was R1138Q (603234.0003).

.0003
PSEUDOXANTHOMA ELASTICUM
ABCC6, ARG1138GLN

In a family with autosomal recessive pseudoxanthoma elasticum (264800),
Le Saux et al. (2000) identified a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 3413
of the ABCC6 gene, resulting in an arginine-to-glutamine substitution at
codon 1138 (R1138Q). This mutation was found in compound heterozygosity
with the IVS21+1G-T mutation (603234.0002).

In a so-called sporadic case of PXE, Ringpfeil et al. (2000) identified
an R1138Q mutation in the ABCC6 gene in compound heterozygosity with the
R1268 mutation (603234.0011). Arginine-1138 is the same codon as that
affected in the R1138W mutation (603234.0012); in the latter mutation,
the nucleotide change is 3412C-T.

.0004
PSEUDOXANTHOMA ELASTICUM
ABCC6, ARG1114PRO

In a family with autosomal recessive pseudoxanthoma elasticum (264800),
Le Saux et al. (2000) found affected individuals to be homozygous for a
G-to-C transversion at nucleotide 3341 of the ABCC6 gene, resulting in
an arg-to-pro substitution at codon 1114 (R1114P) in exon 24. This
mutation was found in homozygosity.

.0005
PSEUDOXANTHOMA ELASTICUM
ABCC6, 1-BP DEL, 3775T

In a patient thought to represent an isolated case of autosomal dominant
pseudoxanthoma elasticum (177850), Le Saux et al. (2000) found a
deletion of a T at nucleotide 3775 of the ABCC6 gene. This was a de novo
mutation in the patient, and no mutations were found in the other allele
of ABCC6 by screening using SSCP.

Plomp et al. (2009) examined a group of 15 adults homozygous for the
3775delT mutation and 44 individuals heterozygous for this mutation from
a genetically isolated population in the Netherlands. All participants
filled out a questionnaire and underwent standardized dermatologic and
ophthalmologic examinations with photography of skin and fundus
abnormalities. Skin biopsies from affected skin or a predilection site
and/or a scar were examined and compared with biopsies from controls.
Plomp et al. (2009) found that skin abnormalities, ophthalmologic signs,
and cardiovascular problems varied greatly among the 15 homozygous
participants. There was no correlation among severity of skin, eyes, or
cardiovascular abnormalities. None of the 44 heterozygous participants
had any sign of pseudoxanthoma elasticum on dermatologic,
histopathologic, and/or ophthalmologic examination, but 32% had
cardiovascular disease.

ABCC6, ARG1314TRP

Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum

In a patient with autosomal recessive pseudoxanthoma elasticum (264800),
Le Saux et al. (2000) identified a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 3940
of the ABCC6 gene, resulting in an arg-to-trp substitution at codon 1314
(R1314W). This mutation was found in homozygosity in one family.

Generalized Arterial Calcification of Infancy 2

In a 5-year-old boy with generalized arterial calcification of infancy
(GACI2; 614473), Nitschke et al. (2012) identified homozygosity for the
R1314W mutation. The boy was born as the first of dizygotic twins, and
his twin brother was unaffected. The patient had calcification of the
aorta and pulmonary, coronary, and renal arteries as well as other
arteries, and stippled calcifications of proximal epiphyses of humeri,
femora, pelvic cartilage, larynx, and mandible. He had severely
decreased biventricular systolic function, marked cardiomegaly, and
severe mitral insufficiency, as well as hypertension and respiratory
insufficiency. Cerebral MRI revealed diffuse white matter disease, with
cystic encephalomalacia, and laboratory analysis showed
hyperbilirubinemia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Nitschke et al. (2012)
also identified the R1314W mutation in compound heterozygosity in 2
unrelated GACI patients, a French female infant who died at 6 weeks of
age and also carried an R1141X mutation (603234.0001), and an
Afro-Caribbean male infant who died at 8 weeks of age with generalized
arterial stenosis, myocardial infarction, and hypertension and also
carried a 1-bp insertion (450insC; 603234.0028) in exon 4 of the ABCC6
gene, predicted to result in a premature stop codon and a truncated
protein. In addition, in a 3-year-old South African girl with GACI,
Nitschke et al. (2012) identified only a heterozygous R1314W mutation,
but noted that mutations in regulatory untranslated regions of ABCC6
might not have been detected by their technique. In the South African
child, onset of symptoms occurred at 2.5 years of age, and included
calcification of the aorta, spleen, and pancreas, nephrocalcinosis,
failure to thrive, hypertension, and heart failure.

.0007
PSEUDOXANTHOMA ELASTICUM
ABCC6, 1-BP DEL, 3798T

In a large autosomal recessive pseudoxanthoma elasticum (264800) family,
Bergen et al. (2000) identified the deletion of a T at nucleotide 3798
of the ABCC gene in homozygosity. This mutation results in a frameshift
and premature chain termination.

.0008
PSEUDOXANTHOMA ELASTICUM
ABCC6, 4-BP INS, 4243AGAA

In 2 families segregating what was thought to be autosomal dominant
pseudoxanthoma elasticum (177850), Bergen et al. (2000) identified a
4-bp insertion, AGAA, at nucleotide 4243 in exon 30. This insertion
causes a frameshift resulting in the disruption of the Walker B motif
and a protein longer by 24 amino acids.

.0009
PSEUDOXANTHOMA ELASTICUM
ABCC6, 22-BP DEL

In a patient with pseudoxanthoma elasticum (177850), Bergen et al.
(2000) identified a 22-basepair deletion from nucleotides 1967 through
1989 of the ABCC6 gene in heterozygosity. The other allele appeared to
be wildtype.

.0010
PSEUDOXANTHOMA ELASTICUM
ABCC6, DEL

In a patient with pseudoxanthoma elasticum (177850), Bergen et al.
(2000) detected a large deletion encompassing the ABCC6 gene as well as
the MYH11 (160745) and ABCC1 (158343) genes. The other allele appeared
to be wildtype.

.0011
PSEUDOXANTHOMA ELASTICUM
ABCC6, ARG1268GLN

Ringpfeil et al. (2000) found an arg1268-to-gln (R1268Q) mutation in
compound heterozygous state in 3 presumably unrelated families with PXE
(264800). In 2 families, the mutation was combined with R1141X
(603234.0001); in 1 family, it was combined with R1138Q (603234.0003).

In one of the families with PXE in which the R1141X mutation had been
identified by Ringpfeil et al. (2000), Germain et al. (2000) identified
a 3803G-A transition in exon 27 of the ABCC6 cDNA, resulting in an
R1268Q mutation. To their surprise, the R1268Q variant was found in
homozygous state in the proband's unaffected husband. They investigated
the R1268Q mutation and found the Q1268 allele at a relatively high
frequency (0.19) in a control population of 62 Caucasians. Genotype
frequencies were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and 3 healthy volunteers
were homozygous for the Q1268 allele. R1268Q is thus a harmless
polymorphism when present in homozygous state.

.0012
PSEUDOXANTHOMA ELASTICUM
ABCC6, ARG1138TRP

In a familial case of PXE (264800), Ringpfeil et al. (2000) found
homozygosity for an arg1138-to-trp (R1138W) mutation in the ABCC6 gene
due to a 3412C-T transition. The mutation was found in homozygous state
in the proband's mother and in heterozygous state in her father,
creating a pedigree pattern of pseudodominance. The same codon is
involved in the R1138Q mutation due to a 3413G-A transition
(603234.0003).

Ringpfeil et al. (2001) discussed the same pedigree, derived from a
consanguineous French-Canadian PXE family.

.0013
PSEUDOXANTHOMA ELASTICUM
ABCC6, ARG1164TER

Ringpfeil et al. (2001) studied the ABCC6 mutation in 4 multiplex
families with PXE (264800) inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.
In each family, the proband was a compound heterozygote for a single-bp
substitution mutation (3490C-T; arg1164 to ter) and a novel deletion of
approximately 16.5 kb spanning the site of the single-bp substitution in
trans (i.e., on the homologous chromosome 16) (603234.0014). In 2 of the
families the single-nucleotide substitution was R1164X; in 1 it was
R1141X (603234.0001); and in another it was a splice site mutation,
3736-1G-A (603234.0015). In all 4 families the patients were thought
first to be homozygous for the nondeletion mutation. The deletion
mutation was shown to extend from intron 22 to intron 29, resulting in
out-of-frame deletion of 1,213 nucleotides from the corresponding mRNA
and causing elimination of 505 amino acids from the MRP6 polypeptide.
The deletion breakpoints were precisely the same in all 4 families,
which were of different ethnic backgrounds, and haplotype analysis by 13
microsatellite markers suggested that the deletion had occurred
independently. Deletion breakpoints within introns 22 and 29 were
embedded within AluSx repeat sequences, specifically in a 16-bp segment
of DNA, suggesting Alu-mediated homologous recombination as a mechanism.

ABCC6, EX23-29DEL

In a cohort of 101 unrelated patients with PXE (264800), Le Saux et al.
(2001) identified a 16.4-kb deletion of the ABCC6 gene (deletion of
exons 23-29) in 12.9% of mutant alleles. The frequency was very
different in Europe and the United States, being 4.3% and 28.4%,
respectively. The frequency of individuals homozygous for this mutation
was observed to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the United States.

ABCC6, ARG1339CYS

In 17 Afrikaner families in South Africa with autosomal recessive
pseudoxanthoma elasticum (264800), Le Saux et al. (2002) found that 53%
of the PXE-associated alleles of the ABCC6 gene had a 4015C-T
transition, which caused an arg1339-to-cys (R1339C) mutation. Haplotype
analysis showed that the mutation was identical by descent in these
families.

.0018
PSEUDOXANTHOMA ELASTICUM
ABCC6, ARG1459CYS

In a family in which PXE classified as 'definite' occurred in 2
generations, Plomp et al. (2004) detected an arg1459-to-cys substitution
(R1459C) in the ABCC protein on 1 allele only. The authors considered
the diagnosis of PXE definite if 2 of the following 3 criteria were
present: yellowish papules and/or plaques on the lateral side of the
neck and/or flexural areas of the body; typical histopathological
changes in a skin biopsy after von Kossa staining; and the presence of
peau d'orange, angioid streaks, or comet-like streaks in the retina. The
mother of this family and one of her sons fulfilled all 3 criteria.
Plomp et al. (2004) stated that the R1459C mutation might be one that
could cause PXE in the heterozygous state (177850). In their review of
families with putative autosomal dominant PXE, including this family and
2 others examined by them, the authors noted that they did not find a
single family with definite PXE in 3 or more generations.

Bergen (2006) stated that the family with the apparently heterozygous
R1459C mutation studied by Plomp et al. (2004) remained 'an interesting
puzzle and is perhaps the always existing 'exception to the rule'.'

.0019
PSEUDOXANTHOMA ELASTICUM
ABCC6, VAL1298PHE

In a cohort of 122 unrelated patients with PXE (264800) from several
countries, Le Saux et al. (2001) found a 3892G-T transversion in exon 28
of the ABCC6 gene that resulted in a val1298-to-phe (V1298F)
substitution. The mutation was present in heterozygosity in 2 alleles
from patients from the United States, for an allele frequency among 74
United States alleles of 2.7%. The mutation was not found in the
European population.

Ilias et al. (2002) showed that the V1298F mutation, localized to the
C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of ABCC6, did not affect the expression of
the ABCC6 protein in infected insect cells, but that the protein was
essentially inactive in the MgATP-dependent transport of
N-ethylmaleimide S-glutathione (NEM-GS) or leukotriene-C4.

.0020
PSEUDOXANTHOMA ELASTICUM
ABCC6, GLY1302ARG

In a cohort of 122 unrelated patients with PXE (264800) from several
countries, Le Saux et al. (2001) found a 3904G-A transition in exon 28
of the ABCC6 gene that resulted in a gly1302-to-arg (G1302R) amino acid
substitution in the second intracellular nucleotide-binding domain. The
mutation, present in homozygosity, occurred in a total of 4 alleles from
patients from the United States, giving an allele frequency of 5.4% in a
total of 74 United States alleles. It was not found in the European
population.

Ilias et al. (2002) showed that the G1302R mutation did not affect the
expression of the ABCC6 protein in infected insect cells, but that the
protein was essentially inactive in the MgATP-dependent transport of
N-ethylmaleimide S-glutathione (NEM-GS) or leukotriene-C4.

of the ABCC6 gene that resulted in a gly1321-to-ser (G1321S)
substitution in the second intracellular nucleotide-binding domain. They
found the mutation in heterozygosity in 1 of 74 United States alleles,
for an allele frequency of 1.4%. It was not found in the European
population.

Ilias et al. (2002) showed that the G1321S mutation did not affect the
expression of the ABCC6 protein in infected insect cells, but that the
protein was essentially inactive in the MgATP-dependent transport of
N-ethylmaleimide S-glutathione (NEM-GS) or leukotriene-C4.

ABCC6, ASP1238HIS

Chassaing et al. (2004) described a pedigree of PXE (264800) with
pseudodominant inheritance. Two affected sibs carried 3 distinct
mutations of the ABCC6 gene. The brother carried a 3712G-C transversion
in exon 26 that resulted in an asp1238-to-his substitution (D1238H), and
a 3389C-T transition in exon 24 that resulted in a thr1130-to-met
substitution (T1130M; 603234.0024). His sister carried the T1130M
mutation and a 33-bp deletion (603234.0023). The mother, who had PXE
also, was deduced to a compound heterozygote for the deletion and
T1130M, whereas the father was assumed to be heterozygous for the D1238H
mutation which was shared by the sibs; however, DNA was not available
for study on either parent.

PSEUDOXANTHOMA ELASTICUM
ABCC6, 33-BP DEL

In the Algerian pedigree studied by Chassaing et al. (2004), a female
patient with PXE (264800) carried a 33-bp deletion in exon 9 of the
ABCC6 gene (1088-1120del) in compound heterozygosity with a missense
mutation (603234.0024). The mutation led to the deletion of 11 amino
acids in the transmembrane and intracellular domains (Q363_R373del).

ABCC6, ARG765GLN

In a 28-year-old French man with pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE; 264800),
who had a younger brother who died of generalized arterial calcification
of infancy (GACI2; 614473) at age 15 months, Le Boulanger et al. (2010)
identified compound heterozygosity for missense mutations in the ABCC6
gene, an arg765-to-gln (R765Q) substitution and a gln1406-to-lys
(Q1406K; 603234.0026) substitution. The mutations were found in
heterozygosity in each of his unaffected parents, respectively. Although
no DNA material was available from the deceased younger brother, his
disease was presumed to be related to the familial ABCC6 mutations. Le
Boulanger et al. (2010) concluded that GACI may represent an atypical
and severe end of the vascular phenotype spectrum of PXE. (The mutations
identified by Le Boulanger et al. (2010) were listed as R765Q and Q1406K
in their text, but as E765Q and E1406K in their Figure 3.)

The R765Q mutation in exon 18 of the ABCC6 gene has also been identified
in heterozygosity and in compound heterozygosity with another ABCC6
mutation in patients with PXE (see Le Saux et al., 2001 and Miksch et
al., 2005, respectively).

pancreatic arteries, nephrocalcinosis, severe hypertension,
cardiomegaly, psychomotor retardation, and abdominal distention,
Nitschke et al. (2012) identified compound heterozygosity for 2
mutations in the ABCC6 gene: an R1141X substitution (603234.0001) and a
1552C-T transition in exon 12, resulting in an arg518-to-ter (R518X)
substitution.

The R518X mutation has also been identified in compound heterozygosity
with another ABCC6 mutation in patients with pseudoxanthoma elasticum
(PXE; 264800) (see, e.g., Meloni et al., 2001 and Miksch et al., 2005).

ABCC6, IVS21, G-T, +1

In a Canadian female infant with generalized arterial calcification of
infancy (GACI2; 614473), originally reported by Glatz et al. (2006), who
died at 6.5 weeks of age of myocardial infarction with calcification of
the aorta and coronary, pulmonary, and renal arteries and occlusion of
the right coronary artery, Nitschke et al. (2012) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 splice site mutations in the ABCC6 gene, a G-T
transversion in intron 21 (IVS21+1G-T) and a IVS26-1G-A (603234.0015),
both predicted to cause a frameshift resulting in a premature
termination codon. The latter mutation had previously been identified in
compound heterozygosity in a patient with pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE;
264800).

The IVS21+1G-T splice-site mutation has also been identified in compound
heterozygosity with another ABCC6 mutation in PXE patients (see, e.g.,
Le Saux et al., 2001 and Miksch et al., 2005).

102771	TITLE *102771 ADENOSINE MONOPHOSPHATE DEAMINASE 2; AMPD2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Adenosine monophosphate deaminase-2 (EC 3.5.4.6) catalyzes the
deamination of AMP to IMP and plays an important role in the purine
nucleotide cycle.

CLONING

By screening a human spleen cDNA library with a previously cloned
partial rat AMPD2 cDNA, followed by the use of PCR techniques,
Bausch-Jurken et al. (1992) isolated cDNA clones for human AMPD2 from
T-lymphoblast and placenta libraries. The deduced 760-amino acid
polypeptide has a predicted molecular mass of 88.1 kD and shares
significant homology in the C-terminal region with AMPD1 (102770). AMPD2
encodes isoform L (liver).

Morisaki et al. (1990) found that whereas AMPD1 is expressed at high
levels in skeletal muscle of the adult rat, AMPD2, which they cloned
from an adult rat brain cDNA library, is the predominant gene expressed
in nonmuscle tissues and smooth muscle of the adult rat and is also the
predominant gene expressed in embryonic muscle and undifferentiated
myoblasts. Both genes are expressed in cardiac muscle of the adult rat.
The peptides encoded by these 2 genes have distinct immunologic
properties. Human isoform L corresponds to rat isoform B (liver and
kidney).

MAPPING

By Southern blot analysis, Moseley et al. (1990) demonstrated that
distinct restriction fragments in the rat and human genome hybridized to
AMPD1 and AMPD2 cDNAs. Indirect evidence suggested that the 2 genes are
linked; L6 myoblasts resistant to coformycin coamplified both genes
while expressing only AMPD2. Moseley et al. (1990) demonstrated further
that Ampd1 and Ampd2 are closely linked on distal mouse chromosome 3.

By studies of human/mouse somatic cell hybrids, Eddy et al. (1993)
demonstrated that the AMPD2 gene is localized to 1p, as is AMPD1.

Mahnke-Zizelman et al. (1996) refined the map location of AMPD2 to
chromosome 1p13.3 using somatic cell hybrids and fluorescence in situ
hybridization.

GENE STRUCTURE

Mahnke-Zizelman et al. (1996) showed that the AMPD2 gene contains 19
exons and spans 14 kb of genomic DNA. Alternatively spliced forms arise
from the use of either exon 1A or exon 1B, both of which have promoter
activity and contain an initiation codon.

GENE FUNCTION

Van den Berghe and Hers (1980) noted that AMP deaminase is normally
about 95% inhibited by guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and may be the
limiting step in adenine nucleotide catabolism. They studied the liver
from a man with familial primary gout and found defective inhibition of
AMP deaminase by GTP. The authors suggested that a genetically
determined reduction in sensitivity of AMP deaminase to inhibition might
be a basis for primary gout.

603491	TITLE *603491 IMMUNOGLOBULIN SUPERFAMILY, MEMBER 3; IGSF3
DESCRIPTION Saupe et al. (1998) isolated a human cDNA encoding a novel
immunoglobulin (Ig)-like membrane protein, named immunoglobulin
superfamily member-3 (IGSF3). The deduced 1,215-amino acid protein
contains an N-terminal signal sequence followed by a large extracellular
domain composed of 8 Ig-like domains with 7 potential N-glycosylation
sites; a potential hydrophobic transmembrane domain; and a C-terminal
charged cytoplasmic tail. The Ig-like domains are of the V type, and a
search of the sequence databases revealed that the IGSF3 protein is 32%
identical to human V7 (604516), a leukocyte surface protein. The authors
detected a major 8-kb mRNA and minor 6- and 4-kb mRNA species in a
variety of human tissues by Northern blot analysis.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization and somatic cell hybrid analyses,
Saupe et al. (1998) localized the human IGSF3 gene to 1p13 and
demonstrated the presence of related sequences on chromosomes 2 and 13.

;;GROWTH STIMULATION-EXPRESSED GENE, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF;;
ST2, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; ST2;;
INTERLEUKIN 33 RECEPTOR; IL33R
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

IL1RL1 is an IL1 (see 147760) family receptor that is selectively
expressed on T helper-2 (Th2) cells and mast cells. It mediates the
biologic effects of IL33 (608678), a member of the IL1 family that
potently drives production of Th2-associated cytokines (e.g., IL4;
147780) (summary by Yagami et al., 2010).

CLONING

Tominaga (1989) isolated a murine gene, which they termed St2, as one of
the genes specifically expressed by growth stimulation in BALB/c-3T3
cells. The gene encodes 2 protein products: St2, the soluble secreted
form; and St2L, the transmembrane receptor form, which is very similar
to the interleukin-1 receptors (147810; 147911) that map to human
chromosome 2. Tominaga (1989) suggested that St2 gene expression is
related to the growth of cells and that an unknown signal is transduced
to control cell proliferation by binding of specific ligand(s). Because
the symbol ST2 had already been assigned to a locus on 11p (see 185440),
the HUGO Nomenclature Committee designated the human homolog of the
mouse St2 gene as IL1RL1.

By use of a mouse St2 probe to screen an activated human helper T-cell
line library, Tominaga et al. (1992) isolated a cDNA for IL1RL1, which
encodes a 328-amino acid protein with 9 potential glycosylation sites
and 3 Ig-like domains. By Northern blot analysis, Kumar et al. (1997)
detected expression of a 1.4-kb IL1RL1 transcript in skeletal muscle,
heart, brain, and pancreas, with additional 2.5- and 4.2-kb transcripts
in lung, liver, placenta, and kidney. By RT-PCR analysis, they observed
constitutive expression in mesenchymal and myeloblastic cell lines, with
further induction by phorbol ester or cytokine stimulation. Expression
in mouse, in contrast, occurs only between days 2 and 4 after exposure
to UVB irradiation.

Tago et al. (2001) found that a third splice variant of IL1RL1, ST2V,
has an additional exon, designated 5E, and encodes a protein with a
predicted molecular mass of 30 kD. Transfection of ST2V into COS-7 cells
resulted in expression of a glycosylated protein with an apparent
molecular mass of 40 kD. Using confocal laser microscopy, they localized
ST2V to the plasma membrane. RT-PCR with primers designed to amplify
exon 5E indicated expression in colon, stomach, small intestine, lung,
spleen, testis, and placenta, and no expression in brain, heart, liver,
kidney, and skeletal muscle. Tago et al. (2001) noted that this pattern
of expression is different from that of IL1RL1 or ST2L.

GENE FUNCTION

Brint et al. (2004) noted that, unlike most members of the Toll (see
TLR4; 603030)-IL1R (TIR) superfamily, IL1RL1 does not induce an
inflammatory response or activate NFKB (see 164011), although it does
activate MAP kinases. IL1RL1 is present on Th2 but not Th1 T
lymphocytes, and neutralization of IL1RL1 enhances Th1 cell responses
and inhibits allergic airway inflammation. Using macrophages from Il1rl1
-/- mice, Brint et al. (2004) detected enhanced production of
proinflammatory cytokines in response to IL1A (147760), IL1B (147720),
lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a TLR4 ligand, bacterial lipoprotein, a TLR2
(603028) ligand, and CpG, a TLR9 (605474) ligand, but not to poly(I:C),
a TLR3 (603029) ligand. These results suggested that Il1rl1 is a
negative regulator of IL1R1 (147810), TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9 signaling.
Cotransfection of Il1rl1 into cells overexpressing Myd88 (602170) or Mal
(606252) inhibited Myd88/Mal-induced NFKB activation in a dose-dependent
manner. GST-fusion proteins containing the TIR domain of Il1rl1 were
able to interact with Mal or Myd88, suggesting that IL1RL1 inhibition of
TLR4 and IL1R1 signaling may be due to the sequestration of these
downstream signaling components by IL1RL1. Brint et al. (2004) proposed
that IL1RL1 is necessary for endotoxin tolerance and, by inhibiting TLR
responses, enhances Th2 responses.

Using immunoprecipitation, immunoblot, and pull-down analyses, Schmitz
et al. (2005) showed that IL33 (608678) bound to ST2. NFKB-dependent
reporter assays and flow cytometry demonstrated that IL33 signaled
through ST2. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis of
transfected cells and ST2-expressing mast cells showed that IL33
stimulation recruited MYD88, IRAK (300283), IRAK4 (606883), and TRAF6
(602355), followed by phosphorylation of ERK1 (MAPK3; 601795)/ERK2
(MAPK1; 176948), p38 (MAPK14; 600289), and JNK (see 601158). Addition of
IL33 to polarized mouse Th2 lymphocytes expressing St2 resulted in
increased production of Il5 (147850) and Il13 (147683), whereas IL33
reduced the level of Ifng (147570) produced by polarized mouse Th1
cells.

Using immunohistochemistry, Xu et al. (2008) demonstrated that synovial
membranes from rheumatoid arthritis (RA; 180300) patients expressed both
IL33 and ST2 in the lining layer and the interstitial sublining layers.
Immunohistochemical and RT-PCR analyses showed that primary synovial
fibroblasts from these patients expressed IL33 only after addition of
TNF (191160) and IL1B.

Using mice with a naturally occurring Ncf1 (608512) mutation reported by
Hultqvist et al. (2004) and rat type II collagen (CII), which, like
human CII (COL2A1; 120140), differs from the mouse sequence only at
residue 266, Hagenow et al. (2009) examined arthritis in a mouse model
that did not require the use of adjuvant. Mutant mice produced lower
levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), but increased levels of
autoantibodies and greater numbers of T cells expressing Il33r. With
impaired T-cell tolerance of tissue-specific CII, the mice developed
severe arthritis. Hagenow et al. (2009) concluded that insufficient ROS
production promotes breakdown of immune tolerance and development of
autoimmune and adjuvant-free arthritis through an IL5- and
IL33R-dependent T-cell activation pathway.

By RT-PCR analysis of cultured human lung cell subpopulations, Yagami et
al. (2010) detected IL33R expression in endothelial and epithelial
cells, but not in fibroblasts or smooth muscle cells. IL33 induced IL8
(146930) expression in IL33R-positive cells, which could be inhibited by
IL33R small interfering RNA and, on epithelial cells only,
corticosteroid treatment. IL4 and IL13 enhanced IL33R expression. IL33
induced activation of ERK in epithelial cells and both ERK and p38 in
endothelial cells. Yagami et al. (2010) proposed that IL33-mediated
inflammatory responses of lung tissue cells may be involved in chronic
allergic inflammation of the asthmatic airway.

MAPPING

Tominaga et al. (1996) assigned the human IL1RL1 gene to chromosome 2 by
analysis of human/rodent somatic cell hybrids. They refined the
assignment to 2q11.2 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The gene is
very tightly linked to IL1R1 (147810). Together with the structural
similarity of IL1RL1 to IL1R1, the findings suggested to the authors a
functional relationship between these 2 genes. Sims et al. (1995) mapped
the IL1RL1 gene to 2q12 by inclusion within a YAC contig.

Dale and Nicklin (1999) showed by radiation hybrid mapping that IL1R2
(147811), IL1R1, IL1RL2 (604512), IL1RL1, and IL18R1 (604494) map to
2q12 and are transcribed in the same direction, with IL1R2 being
transcribed towards the cluster.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Shimizu et al. (2005) found a significant genetic association between
atopic dermatitis (ATOD; 603165) and a -26999G/A SNP (P-value =
0.000007; odds ratio 1.86) in the distal promoter region of the IL1RL1
gene in a study of 452 ATOD patients and 636 healthy controls. The
-26999A allele common among ATOD patients positively regulated the
transcriptional activity of ST2. In addition, having at least one
-26999A allele correlated with high soluble ST2 concentrations and high
total IgE levels in the sera from ATOD patients. Shimizu et al. (2005)
concluded that the -26999A allele of the IL1RL1 gene is correlated with
an increased risk for atopic dermatitis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Xu et al. (2008) found that St2 -/- mice exhibited attenuated induction
of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), a model for RA, as well as reduced
production of Il17 (603149), Ifng, and Tnf in vitro and serum anti-type
II collagen IgG2a. Il33 administration exacerbated CIA, but did not
affect disease incidence, in wildtype mice, but not in St2 -/- mice.
Treatment of wildtype mast cells, but not those from St2 -/- mice, with
Il33 induced production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines,
including Il13. Mice lacking St2 and engrafted with wildtype mast cells
showed exacerbated CIA when treated with Il33. Xu et al. (2008)
concluded that IL33 is a critical proinflammatory cytokine for joint
disease that integrates fibroblast activation with downstream immune
activation via an IL33-driven, mast cell-dependent pathway. They
suggested that IL33 may be a therapeutic target for RA.

Buckley et al. (2011) found that St2 -/- mice were more susceptible to
polymicrobial sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture. The
increased susceptibility was associated with impaired phagosome
maturation and Nox2 (CYBB; 300481) function, which is required for
reactive oxygen species production. Peritoneal leukocyte accumulation
and phagocytic receptor expression were identical in St2 -/- and
wildtype mice.

608725	TITLE *608725 PHOSPHATASE AND ACTIN REGULATOR 3; PHACTR3
;;SCAFFOLD-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 1-INHIBITING PROTEIN; SCAPININ
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Sagara et al. (2003) developed antibodies against 2 isoforms of PHACTR3,
which they designated scapinin-S and scapinin-L, that were associated
with chromatin-depleted nuclei of myeloid leukemia (HL-60) cells. By
immunoscreening an HL-60 cDNA expression library, followed by 3-prime
and 5-prime RACE, they cloned the 2 splice variants. Scapinin-S encodes
a deduced 448-amino acid protein with an apparent molecular mass of 60
kD, and scapinin-L encodes a deduced 518-amino acid protein with an
apparent molecular mass of 75 kD. Northern blot analysis detected high
expression of scapinin in brain and much lower levels in thymus, spleen,
and placenta. Immunolocalization of transfected and endogenous scapinin
revealed predominantly nuclear localization. Immunostaining showed a
granular distribution in the nuclei of HL-60 cells. Fluorescent-labeled
scapinin-L was localized in some cytoplasmic extensions, as well as
nuclei, in HeLa cells. Both scapinin-S and scapinin-L concentrated
within the nuclear matrix-intermediate filament scaffold of
chromatin-depleted HL-60 cell nuclei. The 2 proteins were mostly
recovered in the intermediate filament fraction.

By searching databases for sequences similar to rat Phactr1 (608723),
Allen et al. (2004) identified a family of 4 PHACTR genes in mouse and
human, including PHACTR3. The PHACTR proteins share highest similarity
in sequences surrounding the N- and C-terminal RPEL repeats and in the
C-terminal actin- and protein phosphatase-1 (PP1; see PPP1CA,
176875)-binding domains. In situ hybridization of rat brain showed
diffuse Phactr3 expression, with higher abundance in cortex and
hippocampus than in striatum and thalamus.

GENE FUNCTION

Sagara et al. (2003) found that scapinin interacted with PPP1CA in a
yeast 2-hybrid assay of a placenta cDNA library. Both scapinin isoforms
coimmunoprecipitated with PPP1CA following coexpression in COS-7 cells.
Mutation analysis determined that a 70-amino acid C-terminal domain
bound PPP1CA. This domain also inhibited rabbit skeletal muscle PP1
activity.

Allen et al. (2004) found that mouse Phactr3 coprecipitated with both
PP1 and actin following expression in human embryonic kidney cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sagara et al. (2003) determined that the PHACTR3 gene contains 13 exons
and spans about 130 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Sagara et al. (2003) mapped the PHACTR3
gene to chromosome 20q13.32.

;;ACTIVATOR 1, 140-KD SUBUNIT;;
REPLICATION FACTOR C, 140-KD SUBUNIT; RFC140;;
RFC
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Replication factor C is a multisubunit, DNA polymerase accessory protein
required for the coordinated synthesis of both DNA strands during simian
virus 40 DNA replication in vitro. It is a DNA-dependent ATPase that
binds in a structure-specific manner to the 3-prime end of a primer
hybridized to a template DNA, an activity thought intrinsic to the
140-kD component of this multisubunit complex. Bunz et al. (1993)
isolated and analyzed cDNAs encoding the 140-kD subunit. An open reading
frame of 3.4 kb was predicted to encode a 1,148-amino acid protein with
a predicted molecular mass of 130 kD. A putative ATP-binding motif was
observed that is similar to a motif in several of the smaller subunits
of RFC and in functionally homologous replication factors of bacterial
and viral origin. The predicted protein showed similarities to other
DNA-binding proteins.

Luckow et al. (1994) isolated a full-length mouse cDNA encoding a
protein that binds in a sequence-unspecific manner to DNA, is localized
exclusively in the nucleus, and represents, they concluded, the 140-kD
subunit of mouse replication factor C. They found that it showed 83%
identity to the human protein.

Human replication factor C (RFC), also called activator-1, is a
multimeric primer-recognition protein consisting of 5 distinct subunits
of 145, 40, 38, 37, and 36.5 kD. Human RFC was purified from extracts of
HeLa cells as a host factor essential for the in vitro replication of
simian virus 40 (SV40) DNA (Okumura et al., 1995). RFC, in the presence
of ATP, assembles proliferating-cell nuclear antigen (PCNA; 176740) and
DNA polymerase-delta (174761) or polymerase-epsil on (174762) on primed
DNA templates. The complex of primed DNA-RFC-PCNA-DNA polymerase, when
supplemented with dNTPs, results in the efficient elongation of DNA in
the presence of human single-stranded DNA binding protein. Studies with
the complete 5-subunit holoenzyme indicated that the large subunit binds
to DNA and the 40-kD subunit binds ATP. The other subunits may play
discrete roles in the elongation process catalyzed by polymerase. The
subunit genes are numbered in sequence of decreasing molecular weight:
RFC1, RFC2 (600404), RFC3 (600405), RFC4 (102577), and RFC5 (600407).

GENE FUNCTION

Using interaction cloning, Uchiumi et al. (1996) found that the large
subunit of RFC interacts with the DNA sequence repeats of telomeres.
They found that RFC recognizes the 5-prime-phosphate termini of
double-stranded telomeric repeats. The authors suggested that RFC may be
involved in telomere stability or turnover.

Wang et al. (2000) used immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry
analyses to identify BRCA1 (113705)-associated proteins. They found that
BRCA1 is part of a large multisubunit protein complex of tumor
suppressors, DNA damage sensors, and signal transducers. They named this
complex BASC, for 'BRCA1-associated genome surveillance complex.' Among
the DNA repair proteins identified in the complex were ATM (607585), BLM
(604610), MSH2 (609309), MSH6 (600678), MLH1 (120436), the RAD50
(604040)-MRE11 (600814)-NBS1 (602667) complex, and the RFC1-RFC2
(600404)-RFC4 (102577) complex. Wang et al. (2000) suggested that BASC
may serve as a sensor of abnormal DNA structures and/or as a regulator
of the postreplication repair process.

The RB1 protein (614041) promotes cell survival after DNA damage.
Pennaneach et al. (2001) showed that the LxCxE-binding site in RB1
mediates both cell survival and cell cycle arrest after DNA damage. RFC
complex plays an important role in DNA replication. Pennaneach et al.
(2001) described a function of RFC1 in promoting cell survival after DNA
damage. RFC1 contains an LxCxE motif, and mutation of this motif
abolished the protective effect of RFC1. The inability of wildtype RFC1
to promote cell survival in RB1 null cells was rescued by RB1 but not by
RB1 mutants defective in binding LxCxE proteins. RFC thus enhances cell
survival after DNA damage in an RB1-dependent manner.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Bowman et al. (2004) reported the crystal structure of the 5-protein
clamp loader complex (replication factor-C, RFC) of the yeast S.
cerevisiae, bound to the sliding clamp (proliferating cell nuclear
antigen, or PCNA). Tight interfacial coordination of the ATP analog
ATP-gamma-S by RFC resulted in a spiral arrangement of the ATPase
domains of the clamp loader above the PCNA ring. Placement of a model
for primed DNA within the central hole of PCNA revealed a striking
correspondence between the RFC spiral and the grooves of the DNA double
helix. Bowman et al. (2004) concluded that this model, in which the
clamp loader complex locks into primed DNA in a screwcap-like
arrangement, provides a simple explanation for the process by which the
engagement of primer-template junctions by the RFC:PCNA complex results
in ATP hydrolysis and release of the sliding clamp on DNA.

MAPPING

Luckow et al. (1994) assigned RFC1, the gene for the largest subunit of
replication factor C, to 4p14-p13 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.
They mapped the homolog in the mouse to chromosome 5. Lossie et al.
(1995) likewise mapped this gene, which they symbolized Recc1, to human
chromosome 4 by human/rodent somatic cell hybrid analysis and to mouse
chromosome 5 by haplotype analysis of an interspecific backcross.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching an expressed sequence tag database for sequences showing
homology to the high-affinity Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE)
receptor (CPER; see CPETR1, 602909) of monkey kidney cells (Vero),
Katahira et al. (1997) identified a human breast cDNA encoding CPETR2,
which they named RVP1. The deduced 220-amino acid protein contains 4
putative transmembrane domains. The human RVP1 protein is 89%, 71%, and
70% identical to the rat Rvp1, Vero cell CPER, and human CPETR1
proteins, respectively. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues detected
abundant Rvp1 expression in small intestine, liver, and lung, and much
lower levels in heart, kidney, brain, spleen, and skeletal muscle.

Peacock et al. (1997) isolated a 2.7-kb cosmid subclone containing the
open reading frame and surrounding genomic sequence of CPETR2.
Expression studies indicated that CPETR2 mRNA is widely expressed in
human tissues. The authors stated that CPETR2 belongs to a family of at
least 4 genes that are homologous to rat Rvp1, which is
transcriptionally induced in the regressing rat prostate after
castration and is therefore a putative apoptosis-associated gene.

The tight junction (TJ) is a specialized membrane domain at the most
apical region of polarized epithelial and endothelial cells that creates
a primary barrier to prevent paracellular transport of solutes and
restricts the lateral diffusion of membrane lipids and proteins to
maintain the cellular polarity. Furuse et al. (1998) identified 2
related mouse integral membrane proteins, claudin-1 (CLDN1; 603718) and
claudin-2 (CLDN2; 300520), as novel components of TJ strands.

By sequence analysis, Morita et al. (1999) determined that RVP1, CPETR1,
and TMVCF (602101) are members of the claudin family and designated them
claudin-3 (CLDN3), claudin-4 (CLDN4), and claudin-5 (CLDN5),
respectively. They also identified mouse cDNAs encoding claudin-7
(CLDN7; 609131) and claudin-8 (CLDN8; 611231).

GENE FUNCTION

Katahira et al. (1997) showed that RVP1 is a functional low-affinity
receptor for CPE.

Morita et al. (1999) found that epitope-tagged Cldn3 through Cldn8
showed a tendency to concentrate at TJs when expressed in mammalian
cells. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy showed that
Cldn3 localized specifically to TJ strands in mouse liver. They
concluded that multiple claudin family members are involved in the
formation of TJ strands in various tissues.

Kubota et al. (1999) demonstrated that mouse Cldn1, Cldn2, and Cldn3
possessed Ca(2+)-independent cell adhesion activity following expression
in a mouse fibroblast cell line. Electron microscopy revealed many
points of contact between TJs of adjacent transfected cells.

Coyne et al. (2003) determined that human bronchi and bronchioles
express CLDN1, CLDN3, CLDN4, CLDN5, and CLDN7. CLDN1 and CLDN4 localized
to the apical tight junction region and in lateral intercellular
junctions, with staining surrounding basal cells that anchor the
columnar epithelium to the basal lamina. In contrast, CLDN3 and CLDN5
localized exclusively to the apical-most region of the tight junction.
CLDN7 colocalized with ZO1 (TJP1; 601009) in lateral intercellular
junctions, with little or no staining near tight junctions. Following
overexpression in mouse fibroblasts and human airway epithelium, Coyne
et al. (2003) found that claudins concentrated at cell borders when
cells achieved confluence. Mouse fibroblasts expressing CLDN5 formed TJ
strands composed primarily of particles and particle arrays, similar to
those seen in gap junctions, whereas fibroblasts expressing CLDN1,
CLDN3, or both formed TJ strands that lacked particle arrays. Coyne et
al. (2003) determined that CLDN1 and CLDN3 decreased solute permeability
in overexpressing cells, while CLDN5 increased permeability. CLDN1 and
CLDN3 existed predominantly in monomeric form in human airway epithelium
and in an airway epithelium cell line. In contrast, CLDN5 existed
predominantly in pentameric and hexameric configurations.
Coimmunoprecipitation studies revealed specific heterophilic
interactions that could form between these 3 claudins.

Using microarray analysis, Meng et al. (2005) showed that Cldn3 was
downregulated in mice with a Sertoli-specific ablation of AR (313700).
These mice showed an absence of Cldn3 expression at newly formed tight
junctions and increased permeability of the blood-testis barrier,
suggesting that androgens regulate the assembly or function of Sertoli
cell tight junctions.

Using immunohistochemical analysis, Dube et al. (2007) found that CLDN1,
CLDN3, CLDN4, and CLDN8 were associated with the blood-epididymal
barrier of the epididymal duct. In all 3 epididymal segments, CLDN1,
CLDN3, and CLDN4 localized to tight junctions, along the lateral margins
of adjacent principal cells, and at the interface between basal and
principal cells. In contrast, CLDN8 localized to tight junctions in all
3 segments, along the lateral margins of principal cells in the caput,
and at the interface between basal and principal cells in the corpus.

Smith and Braun (2012) used confocal microscopy to visualize Sertoli
cell tight junction components during germ cell cyst migration across
the Sertoli cell tight junctions. Cysts become enclosed within a network
of transient compartments fully bounded by old and new tight junctions.
Dissolution of the old tight junctions releases the germ cells into the
adluminal compartment, thus completing transit across the blood-testis
barrier. Claudin-3, a tight junction protein, is transiently
incorporated into new tight junctions and then replaced by claudin-11
(CLDN11; 601326).

GENE STRUCTURE

Peacock et al. (1997) determined that the CPETR2 gene does not contain
introns.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid analyses, Peacock et al.
(1997) mapped the CPETR2 gene to 7q11.

By somatic cell hybrid analysis, Paperna et al. (1998) mapped the CLDN3
gene to chromosome 7q11.23. They mapped the mouse Cldn3 gene to a region
of chromosome 5G1 that shares homology of synteny with human chromosome
7q11.23.

139313	TITLE *139313 GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE-BINDING PROTEIN, ALPHA-11; GNA11
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Strathmann and Simon (1991) described the Gna11 gene in the mouse. The
human gene was cloned by Jiang et al. (1991) and found to be 359 amino
acids long. Mouse Gna11 and Gna15 (139314) are tandemly duplicated in a
head-to-tail array. Davignon et al. (1996) showed that the upstream
gene, Gna11, is ubiquitously expressed, whereas expression of the
downstream gene, Gna15, is restricted to hematopoietic cells. There was
no evidence for alternative splicing within the coding sequence of
either gene.

GENE FUNCTION

Using mice lacking G-alpha subunits specifically in smooth muscle cells,
Wirth et al. (2008) found that G-alpha-q (GNAQ; 600998) and G-alpha-11
were required for maintenance of basal blood pressure and for
development of salt-induced hypertension. In contrast, lack of
G-alpha-12 (GNA12; 604394) and G-alpha-13 (GNA13; 604406) and their
effector, Larg (ARHGEF12; 604763), did not alter normal blood pressure
regulation, but blocked development of salt-induced hypertension.

GENE STRUCTURE

Strathmann and Simon (1991) found that mouse Gna11 and Gna15 (139314)
are tandemly duplicated in a head-to-tail array, spanning approximately
43 kb. Davignon et al., 1996 further studied the genomic structure of
mouse Gna11 and Gna15. Gna11 and Gna15 each contain 7 exons interposed
by 6 introns. Gna11 is upstream of Gna15, and the region separating the
2 genes is 6 kb long. Phylogenetic trees revealed an approximately
6-fold higher rate of change in Gna15 than in Gna11.

MAPPING

Wilkie et al. (1992) demonstrated that the GNA11 gene is located on
mouse chromosome 10 (by the study of RFLVs in an interspecific
backcross) and on human 19p13 (by in situ hybridization).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In the proband from a 4-generation kindred with hypocalciuric
hypercalcemia mapping to chromosome 19p13 (HHC2; 145981) and an
unrelated proband with HHC, Nesbit et al. (2013) identified
heterozygosity for a 3-bp in-frame deletion and a missense mutation,
respectively (139313.0001-139313.0002). In addition, 2 unrelated
patients with hypocalcemia (HYPOC2; 615361) were found to be
heterozygous for missense mutations in GNA11 (139313.0003 and
139313.0004). All 4 GNA11 mutations predicted disrupted protein
structures, and functional analysis in HEK293 cells showed that family
hypocalciuric hypercalcemia type II-associated mutations decrease the
sensitivity of cells expressing calcium-sensing receptors to changes in
extracellular calcium concentrations, whereas autosomal dominant
hypocalcemia 2-associated mutations increase cell sensitivity.

In affected members of 2 unrelated 4-generation families segregating
autosomal dominant hypocalcemia, Mannstadt et al. (2013) identified
heterozygous missense mutations (139313.0005 and 139313.0006) that
segregated with disease in each family.

- Somatic Mutations

By gene sequencing of exon 5 of the GNA11 gene, Van Raamsdonk et al.
(2010) identified somatic mutations affecting residue Q209 in 7% of blue
nevi (603670), 32% of primary uveal melanomas (155720), and 57% of uveal
melanoma metastases. Mutations in the same codon (Q209) of the paralogue
gene GNAQ (600998) were found in 55% of blue nevi, 45% of primary uveal
melanomas, and 22% of uveal melanoma metastases. The sample group
included a total of 713 melanocytic neoplasms. Sequencing of exon 4 of
these genes, affecting residue R183, in 453 melanocytic neoplasms showed
a lower prevalence of mutations: 2.1% of blue nevi and 4.9% of primary
uveal melanomas. The mutations were mutually exclusive, except for a
single tumor that carried mutations at both Q209 and R183 in GNA11. In
total, 83% of all uveal melanomas examined had oncogenic mutations in
either GNAQ or GNA11. Mice injected with cells transduced with the GNA11
Q209L mutation developed rapidly growing tumors and metastases, whereas
injection with GNA11 R183C-transduced cells showed lesser potency.
Western blot analysis of melanocytes transduced with Q209L showed
constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway. Although GNA11 mutations
appeared to have a more potent effect on melanocytes than did GNAQ
mutations, there was no difference in patient survival among those with
GNA11 mutations compared to those with GNAQ mutations.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using gene targeting, Offermanns et al. (1998) generated Gna11-deficient
mice that were viable and fertile with no apparent behavioral or
morphologic defects. They bred Gnaq-deficient mice with Gna11-deficient
mice and observed gene dosage effects between Gnaq and Gna11. Embryos
completely lacking both genes died in utero with heart malformations.
Mice inheriting a single copy of either gene died within hours of birth
with craniofacial and/or cardiac defects. Offermanns et al. (1998)
concluded that at least 2 active alleles of these genes are required for
extrauterine life. Genetic, morphologic, and pharmacologic analyses of
intercross offspring inheriting different combinations of these 2
mutations indicated that Gnaq and Gna11 have overlapping functions in
embryonic cardiomyocyte proliferation and craniofacial development.

A new class of dominant 'dark skin' (Dsk) mutations was discovered in a
screen of approximately 30,000 mice in a large-scale mutagenesis study.
These result from increased dermal melanin. Van Raamsdonk et al. (2004)
identified 3 of 4 such mutations as hypermorphic alleles of Gnaq and
Gna11, which encode widely expressed G-alpha-q subunits, act in an
additive and quantitative manner, and require endothelin receptor, type
B (EDNRB; 131244). Interaction between Gq and Kit receptor tyrosine
kinase (164920) signaling can mediate coordinate or independent control
of skin and hair color. The results provided a mechanism that can
explain several aspects of human pigmentary variation and show how
polymorphism of essential proteins and signaling pathways can affect a
single physiologic system.

Kero et al. (2007) generated mice with thyrocyte-specific Gna11/Gnaq
deficiency and observed severely reduced iodine organification and
thyroid hormone secretion in response to TSH, with many of the mice
developing hypothyroidism within months after birth. In addition, these
mice lacked the normal proliferative thyroid response to TSH or
goitrogenic diet. Kero et al. (2007) concluded that the GNA11/GNAQ
pathway has an essential role in the adaptive growth of the thyroid
gland.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPOCALCIURIC HYPERCALCEMIA, FAMILIAL, TYPE II
GNA11, 3-BP DEL, 598ATC

In affected members of a 4-generation family segregating autosomal
dominant hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (HHC2; 145981), originally studied
by Heath et al. (1992) (kindred 11675), Nesbit et al. (2013) identified
heterozygosity for a 3-bp deletion (c.598_600delATC) in the GNA11 gene,
resulting in an in-frame deletion of the highly conserved ile200 residue
(ile200del). The mutation was not found in 55 controls or in 5,400
exomes from the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project. Functional analysis in
HEK293 cells stably expressing calcium-sensing receptors demonstrated
that the GNA11 ile200del mutant induces a decrease in sensitivity to
changes in extracellular calcium concentrations.

.0002
HYPOCALCIURIC HYPERCALCEMIA, FAMILIAL, TYPE II
GNA11, LEU135GLN

In a man who presented at 54 years of age with hypocalciuric
hypercalcemia (HHC2; 145981), Nesbit et al. (2013) identified
heterozygosity for a c.404T-A transversion in the GNA11 gene, resulting
in a leu135-to-gln (L135Q) substitution at a highly conserved residue in
the helical domain. The mutation was not found in 55 controls or in
5,400 exomes from the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project. Functional
analysis in HEK293 cells stably expressing calcium-sensing receptors
demonstrated that the GNA11 L135Q mutant induces a decrease in
sensitivity to changes in extracellular calcium concentrations.

.0003
HYPOCALCEMIA, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT 2
GNA11, ARG181GLN

In a woman who was diagnosed at 52 years of age with hypocalcemia
(HYPOC2; 615361), Nesbit et al. (2013) identified heterozygosity for a
c.542G-A transition in the GNA11 gene, resulting in an arg181-to-gln
(R181Q) substitution at a highly conserved residue in the alpha-F helix
of the helical domain. The mutation was not found in 55 controls or in
5,400 exomes from the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project. Functional
analysis in HEK293 cells stably expressing calcium-sensing receptors
demonstrated that the GNA11 R181Q mutant induces an increase in
sensitivity to changes in extracellular calcium concentrations. The
patient was asymptomatic, but was ascertained after another family
member was diagnosed with hypocalcemia.

.0004
HYPOCALCEMIA, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT 2
GNA11, PHE341LEU

In a woman who presented at 39 years of age with hypocalcemia (HYPOC2;
615361), Nesbit et al. (2013) identified heterozygosity for a c.1023C-G
transversion in the GNA11 gene, resulting in a phe341-to-leu (F341L)
substitution at a highly conserved residue in the GTPase domain. The
mutation was not found in 55 controls or in 5,400 exomes from the NHLBI
Exome Sequencing Project. Functional analysis in HEK293 cells stably
expressing calcium-sensing receptors demonstrated that the GNA11 F341L
mutant induces an increase in sensitivity to changes in extracellular
calcium concentrations. The patient reported a 10-year history of
occasional paresthesias, muscle cramps, and carpopedal spasm.

.0005
HYPOCALCEMIA, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT 2
GNA11, ARG60CYS

In 6 affected members of a 4-generation family segregating autosomal
dominant hypocalcemia (HYPOC2; 615361), Mannstadt et al. (2013)
identified heterozygosity for a c.178C-T transition in exon 2 of the
GNA11 gene, resulting in an arg60-to-cys (R60C) substitution at a highly
conserved residue. The mutation was not found in unaffected family
members.

.0006
HYPOCALCEMIA, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT 2
GNA11, SER211TRP

In 9 affected members of a 4-generation family segregating autosomal
dominant hypocalcemia (HYPOC2; 615361), Mannstadt et al. (2013)
identified heterozygosity for a c.632C-G transversion in exon 5 of the
GNA11 gene, resulting in a ser211-to-trp (S211W) substitution at a
highly conserved residue. The mutation was not found in unaffected
family members.

;;PROTEASOME ASSEMBLY CHAPERONE 2; PAC2;;
TNFSF5-INDUCED PROTEIN 1; TNFSF5IP1;;
HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 3; HCCA3;;
CD40 LIGAND-ACTIVATED SPECIFIC TRANSCRIPT 3; CLAST3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By differential display PCR to identify genes upregulated in
hepatocellular carcinoma, followed by screening a placenta cDNA library,
Wang et al. (2001) cloned TNFSF5IP1, which they called HCCA3. The
deduced 264-amino acid protein contains 2 N-glycosylation sites, 3
N-myristoylation sites, and several phosphorylation sites. Northern blot
analysis detected a 1.7-kb HCCA3 transcript in all tissues examined.
Expression was high in lung, brain, and colon, moderate in muscle,
stomach, spleen, and heart, and weak in small intestine, pancreas, and
liver. Elevated HCCA3 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma was
associated with tumor invasiveness and metastasis, but not with tumor
size, degree of differentiation, or other parameters.

Using immunofluorescence, Bahar et al. (2002) found that mouse Clast3
localized in nuclear dot-like foci in transfected mouse fibroblasts.

GENE FUNCTION

Bahar et al. (2002) found that CLAST3 expression increased in human and
mouse B cells upon activation. In synchronized mouse fibroblasts, Clast3
expression was low in G1-arrested cells and increased during S and G2-M
phases. Overexpression of Clast3 resulted in growth retardation,
polyploidy, and generation of multinucleated cells. Treatment of Clast3
transfectants with nocodazole, a spindle-damaging agent, enhanced the
incidence of multinucleated cells, suggesting that Clast3 impairs the
same checkpoint activated by nocodazole. Downregulation of Clast3
expression by antisense oligonucleotides decreased the number of cells
at G2-M phase and concomitantly increased the number of apoptotic cells.

Hirano et al. (2005) reported 2 chaperones designated
proteasome-assembling chaperone-1 (PAC1; 605296) and PAC2, that are
involved in the maturation of the mammalian 20S proteasomes. PAC1 and
PAC2 associate as heterodimers with proteasome precursors and are
degraded after formation of the 20S proteasome is completed.
Overexpression of PAC1 or PAC2 accelerates the formation of precursor
proteasomes, whereas knockdown by short interfering RNA impairs it,
resulting in poor maturation of 20S proteasomes. Furthermore, Hirano et
al. (2005) showed that the PAC complex provides a scaffold for alpha
ring formation and keeps the alpha rings competent for the subsequent
formation of half-proteasomes. Thus, Hirano et al. (2005) concluded that
their results identify a mechanism for the correct assembly of 20S
proteasomes.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the
TNFSF5IP1 gene to chromosome 18 (TMAP A006T17).

188826	TITLE *188826 TISSUE INHIBITOR OF METALLOPROTEINASE 3; TIMP3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) are natural
inhibitors of the matrix metalloproteinases, a group of zinc-binding
endopeptidases involved in the degradation of the extracellular matrix.
Apte et al. (1994) isolated overlapping cDNAs encoding a novel member of
the group, TIMP3. The cDNAs contained a 591-bp open reading frame
encoding 9 amino acid residues of the signal peptide and 188 residues of
the mature TIMP3 polypeptide. Both the nucleotide sequence and the
deduced translation product of the TIMP3 cDNA had a high degree of
similarity to the TIMP1 (305370) and TIMP2 (188825) gene products,
including 12 conserved cysteinyl residues at the same relative
positions. The TIMP3 gene is expressed in many tissues, with highest
expression in the placenta.

Wilde et al. (1994) cloned and sequenced TIMP3 from phorbol
ester-differentiated cells stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide.
The open reading frame encoded a 211-amino acid precursor, including a
23-residue secretion signal. The mature polypeptide had a calculated
molecular weight of 21.6 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Osman et al. (2002) showed that mature dendritic cells (DCs) produce
more MMP9 (120361) than do immature DCs, facilitating their hydroxaminic
acid-inhibitable migration through gel in vitro and, presumably, through
the extracellular matrix to monitor the antigenic environment in vivo.
RT-PCR analysis indicated that the enhanced expression of MMP9 is
correlated with a downregulation of TIMP1 and, particularly, TIMP2,
while expression of TIMP3 is upregulated. The authors concluded that the
balance of MMP and TIMP determines the net migratory capacity of DCs.
They proposed that TIMP3 may be a marker for mature DCs.

TIMP3 encodes a potent angiogenesis inhibitor and is mutated in Sorsby
fundus dystrophy (136900), a macular degenerative disease with
submacular choroidal neovascularization. Qi et al. (2003) demonstrated
the ability of TIMP3 to inhibit VEGF (192240)-mediated angiogenesis and
identified the potential mechanism by which this occurs: TIMP3 blocks
the binding of VEGF to VEGFR2 (191306) and inhibits downstream signaling
and angiogenesis. This property seems to be independent of its
MMP-inhibitory activity, indicating a new function for TIMP3.

Wild et al. (2003) studied molecular mechanisms contributing to the
tumorigenesis of pancreatic endocrine tumors (PETs). Allelic deletions
at chromosome 22q12.3 were detected in about 30 to 60% of PETs,
suggesting that inactivation of one or more tumor suppressor genes on
this chromosomal arm is important for their pathogenesis. Because the
putative tumor suppressor gene TIMP3 has been located at 22q12.3, Wild
et al. (2003) undertook a genetic analysis of TIMP3 to determine its
role in the tumorigenesis of PETs. Thirteen of 21 PETs (62%) revealed
TIMP3 alterations, including promoter hypermethylation and homozygous
deletion. The predominant TIMP3 alteration was promoter
hypermethylation, identified in 8 of 18 PETs (44%). It was
tumor-specific and corresponded to loss or strong reduction of TIMP3
protein expression. Notably, 11 of 14 PETs (79%) with metastases had
TIMP3 alterations, compared with only 1 of 7 PETs (14%) without
metastases (P less than 0.02). These data suggested a possibly important
role of TIMP3 in the tumorigenesis of human PETs, especially in the
development of metastases.

Because matrix degrading enzymes could potentially influence keratoconus
(see 148300) progression, Matthews et al. (2007) studied the effects of
TIMP1 and TIMP3 on stromal cell viability. Overexpression of TIMP3
induced apoptosis in corneal stromal cell cultures. Upregulated TIMP1
production or the addition of exogenous TIMP1 protein prevented stromal
cell overgrowth, changed stromal cell morphology, and reduced the extent
of TIMP3 induced apoptosis. Localized relative concentrations of
TIMP1/TIMP3 could thus determine whether cells remained viable or became
apoptotic. Matthews et al. (2007) concluded that this might be relevant
to keratoconus because significantly more apoptotic cells were
identified in the anterior stroma of keratoconic corneas than in normal
corneas and the majority of the TIMP1 and TIMP3 producing stromal cells
were located in that region.

GENE STRUCTURE

Stohr et al. (1995) reported the genomic organization of the TIMP3 gene.
TIMP3 is encoded by 5 exons extending over approximately 55 kb of
genomic DNA. The authors compared the 5-prime flanking sequences of the
human and mouse TIMP3 genes and found a high degree of similarity
between them.

MAPPING

By hybridization to a panel of human/hamster somatic cell hybrid DNAs,
Apte et al. (1994) mapped the TIMP3 gene to chromosome 22; by in situ
hybridization, they regionalized the assignment to 22q12.1-q13.2. By
analysis of a panel of mouse/human hybrids, Wilde et al. (1994) assigned
the gene to chromosome 22.

Overlapping gene groups (OGGs) arise when exons of 1 gene are contained
within the introns of another. Typically, the 2 overlapping genes are
encoded on opposite DNA strands. Karlin et al. (2002) identified genes
with OGG architecture and examined their relation to disease. OGGs
appear to be susceptible to genomic rearrangement, as happens commonly
with the loci of DiGeorge syndrome (188400) on chromosome 22. Karlin et
al. (2002) also examined the degree of conservation of OGGs between
human and mouse and cited the striking example of the TIMP and synapsin
genes in the 2 species: TIMP3 and SYN3 (602705) are on human chromosome
22q12.3 and mouse chromosome 10; TIMP1 and SYN1 (313440) are on human
Xp11.3-p11.2 and the mouse X chromosome; and SYN2 (600755) and TIMP4 are
on human 3p25 and mouse chromosome 6.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Weber et al. (1994), who had mapped the gene for Sorsby fundus dystrophy
(SFD; 1136900) to 22q13-qter, examined the TIMP3 gene as a possible site
of causative mutations in SFD on the basis of its chromosomal location
and its pivotal role in extracellular matrix remodeling. They identified
point mutations in TIMP3 in affected members of 2 SFD pedigrees. These
mutations were predicted to disrupt the tertiary structure and thus the
functional properties of the mature protein.

Langton et al. (1998) found that wildtype TIMP3 is localized entirely to
the extracellular matrix (ECM) in both its glycosylated (27 kD) and
unglycosylated (24 kD) forms. A COOH-terminally truncated TIMP3 molecule
was found to be a non-ECM-bound matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)
inhibitor, whereas a chimeric TIMP molecule, consisting of the
NH2-terminal domain of TIMP2 fused to the COOH-terminal domain of TIMP3,
displayed ECM binding, albeit with a lower affinity than the wildtype
TIMP3 molecule. Thus, as in TIMP1 and TIMP2, the NH2-terminal domain is
responsible for MMP inhibition, whereas the COOH-terminal domain is most
important in mediating the specific functions of the molecule. A mutant
TIMP3 in which serine-181 was changed to cysteine (S181C; 188826.0001),
found in Sorsby fundus dystrophy, gave rise to an additional 48-kD
species (possibly a TIMP3 dimer) that retained its ability to inhibit
MMPs and localize to the ECM when expressed in COS-7 cells. These data
favored the hypothesis that the TIMP3 mutation seen in Sorsby fundus
dystrophy contributes to disease progression by accumulation of mutant
protein rather than by loss of functional TIMP3.

Ayyagari et al. (2000) described a 4-generation pedigree with autosomal
dominant hemorrhagic macular degeneration. The phenotype overlapped that
of Sorsby fundus dystrophy. Despite the phenotypic similarities to
Sorsby fundus dystrophy, the large kindred studied by these authors
showed no involvement of the TIMP3 gene by linkage, haplotype, or
mutation analysis. They concluded that exclusion of the TIMP3 gene in
this family indicates genetic heterogeneity for autosomal dominant
hemorrhagic macular dystrophy. The authors reviewed the mutations
reported in all Sorsby fundus dystrophy pedigrees to that time: all
families in the literature showed mutations in the TIMP3 gene, all
involving exon 5 or the intron 4/exon 5 junction.

Langton et al. (2000) stated that 5 different mutations in the TIMP3
gene had previously been identified in cases of Sorsby fundus dystrophy,
all introducing an extra cysteine residue into exon 5 (which forms part
of the C-terminal domain) of the TIMP3 molecule. They described the
expression of several of these mutated genes and reported a novel TIMP3
mutation in a family with Sorsby fundus dystrophy that resulted in
truncation of most of the C-terminal domain of the molecule (E139X;
188826.0005). Despite these differences, all of these molecules were
expressed and exhibited characteristics of the normal protein, including
inhibition of metalloproteinases and binding to the extracellular
matrix. However, unlike wildtype TIMP3, they all formed dimers. These
observations, together with the finding that expression of the TIMP3
gene is increased, rather than decreased, in eyes from patients with
SFD, provided evidence that dimerized TIMP3 plays an active role in the
disease process by accumulating in the eye. Increased expression of
TIMP3 is observed in other degenerative retinal diseases, including the
more severe forms of age-related macular degeneration.

Langton et al. (2005) expressed a range of SFD mutants from human
retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, including S181C, S156C
(188826.0003), and E139X. Resistance to turnover, resulting from
intermolecular disulfide bond formation, was a common property of all
the SFD mutants examined, providing a possible explanation for the
increased deposition of the protein observed in eyes from SFD patients.
In contrast, SFD mutants varied in their ability to inhibit cell-surface
activation of MMP2 (120360), a potent mediator of angiogenesis, ranging
from being fully active to totally inactive. Langton et al. (2005)
concluded that increased deposition of active TIMP3, rather than
dysregulation of metalloproteinase inhibition, is likely to be the
primary initiating event in SFD.

ANIMAL MODEL

Mohammed et al. (2004) showed that deletion of the mouse gene Timp3
resulted in an increase in the activity of TNF-alpha converting enzyme
(TACE; 603639), constitutive release of TNF (191160), and activation of
TNF signaling in the liver. The increase in TNF in Timp3 -/- mice
culminated in hepatic lymphocyte infiltration and necrosis, features
that are also seen in chronic active hepatitis in humans. This pathology
was prevented when deletion of Timp3 was combined with deficiency of
tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 1a (TNFRSF1A;
191190). In a liver regeneration model that required TNF signaling,
Timp3 -/- mice succumbed to liver failure. Hepatocytes from the null
mice completed the cell cycle but then underwent cell death owing to
sustained activation of TNF. This hepatocyte cell death was completely
rescued by a neutralizing antibody to TNF. Dysregulation of TNF occurred
specifically in Timp3 -/- mice and not in mice null for the Timp1 gene
(305370). These data indicated that TIMP3 is a crucial innate negative
regulator of TNF in both tissue homeostasis and tissue response to
injury.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SORSBY FUNDUS DYSTROPHY
TIMP3, SER181CYS

In a family with Sorsby fundus dystrophy (136900), Weber et al. (1994)
found an SSCP band shift in exon 5 of the TIMP3 gene and showed that it
was caused by an A-to-T transversion, changing a conserved serine
residue to a cysteine at position 181 (S181C). This transversion event
also created a new NsiI restriction site which they used to demonstrate
segregation of the mutation in the 12 affected members of the pedigree.

A total of 15 families, unrelated on the basis of genealogy and
afflicted by Sorsby fundus dystrophy, were identified by Wijesuriya et
al. (1996) from a large database of genetic eye disease families
originating from diverse parts of the British Isles. In each family the
identification of the ser181-to-cys mutation segregating with the
disease suggested founder effect. In all families studied, the same
relatively infrequent allele (occurring in just 11% of the control
group) was associated with disease at marker locus D22S280. A highly
significant disease-associated haplotype, spanning 3 cM of the TIMP3
locus, was conserved in 11 of the 15 families (68% of affected
chromosomes); a further extended haplotype spanning up to 7 cM was
identified in 5 families (27% of Sorsby-associated chromosomes) and
possibly represented the ancestral haplotype. This haplotype analysis
refined the TIMP3 gene localization to a 1- to 3-cM interval between
D22S273 and D22S281 and provided strong evidence for a single mutational
event being responsible for most Sorsby fundus dystrophy in the British
Isles where the disorder was first described.

Carrero-Valenzuela et al. (1996) reported a second family with SFD
associated with the S181C mutation in TIMP3. The proband was a
44-year-old white woman who was initially evaluated at the age of 33
because of nyctalopia. Drusen-like changes were present in both eyes,
the results of dark adaptometry were profoundly abnormal, and the
electroretinogram and electrooculogram showed mild impairment. She
developed choroidal neovascularization in her left eye at age 37 and in
her right eye at age 39. Despite multiple sessions of laser
photocoagulation, her visual acuity declined to 20/400 OU owing to
foveal recurrence and disciform macular scarring. Four living relatives
had bilateral exudative maculopathy and legal blindness before age 50.
Three other relatives were probably affected; 2 had clinical reports of
early-onset disciform maculopathy and central vision loss, and 1 had
onset of visual symptoms at age 55 with documented disciform macular
scars at age 66. Two or 3 other members of the family may have been
affected as well.

.0002
SORSBY FUNDUS DYSTROPHY
TIMP3, TYR168CYS

In 2 affected brothers in a family with Sorsby fundus dystrophy
(136900), Weber et al. (1994) found an A-to-G transition changing codon
168 from a highly conserved tyrosine residue to cysteine.

.0003
SORSBY FUNDUS DYSTROPHY
TIMP3, SER156CYS

In a German-Czech family with at least 12 members affected by Sorsby
fundus dystrophy (136900), Felbor et al. (1995) demonstrated
heterozygosity for a C-to-G transversion in the second position of codon
156 of the TIMP3 gene, leading to the replacement of a conserved serine
residue by a cysteine. At the onset of the disease, a central subretinal
neovascularization occurred followed by extensive scarring.
Corresponding to the morphologic changes a central scotoma was found.
However, in contrast to previous descriptions, symptoms were observed
approximately 10 to 15 years earlier with a mean age at onset of 25
years. The disease then progressed more rapidly, with a second eye
involvement occurring within months. In the course of several years, the
patients developed tapetal retinal dystrophy with intraretinal
perivascular bone spicular pigment proliferation, attenuation of the
intraretinal arteries, and atrophy of the choriocapillaris. These
changes were accompanied by loss of the peripheral visual field,
decrease in dark adaptation, and subnormal scotopic and photopic ERG.
All 3 mutations described at the time of the Felbor et al. (1995) report
occurred in the COOH-terminal part of the mature TIMP3 protein within 25
amino acids from each other. The additional thiol group in each case is
located close to the last 2 conserved cysteine residues which normally
participate in intrachain disulfide bond arrangements.

.0004
SORSBY FUNDUS DYSTROPHY, LAVIA TYPE
TIMP3, GLY166CYS

In a large family with several members with Sorsby fundus dystrophy
(136900) residing in the isolated parish of Lavia in southwestern
Finland, a possible autosomal recessive form of SFD was proposed by
Forsius et al. (1982). However, molecular genetic studies by Felbor et
al. (1997) indicated that all affected individuals were in fact
heterozygous for a gly166-to-cys mutation in TIMP3, thus providing
strong evidence for autosomal dominant inheritance of the SFD phenotype.
In this kindred, a consanguineous couple and all of their 8 children had
been found to be affected, suggesting recessive inheritance. A follow-up
study demonstrated an affected mother and daughter elsewhere in the
pedigree.

.0005
SORSBY FUNDUS DYSTROPHY
TIMP3, GLU139TER

In affected members of a family with Sorsby fundus dystrophy (136900) in
3 successive generations, Langton et al. (2000) found a glu139-to-ter
(E139X) mutation in the TIMP3 gene. Because of a G-to-T transversion in
the first base of codon 139, a normal GAG codon was replaced by a TAG
termination codon.

603287	TITLE *603287 PYRIDOXAMINE 5-PRIME-PHOSPHATE OXIDASE; PNPO
;;PYRIDOXAMINE-PHOSPHATE OXIDASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Vitamin B6, or pyridoxal 5-prime-phosphate (PLP), is critical for normal
cellular function, and some cancer cells have notable differences in
vitamin B6 metabolism compared to their normal counterparts. The
rate-limiting enzyme in vitamin B6 synthesis is
pyridoxine-5-prime-phosphate (PNP) oxidase (PNPO; EC 1.4.3.5).

CLONING

Ngo et al. (1998) isolated a PNPO clone from a rat liver library. They
found that the predicted 30-kD protein contained the PNPO signature
motif found in the PNPO of S. cerevisiae and bacteria and 5 predicted
protein kinase C (see 176960) phosphorylation sites.

Kang et al. (2004) cloned full-length PNPO from a whole brain cDNA
library. The deduced 261-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of 30 kD. Posttranslational modification sites include a sulfation
site, 9 phosphorylation sites, 3 N-myristoylation sites, and an RGD cell
attachment sequence. PNPO shares 90% amino acid identity with mouse
Pnpo. Northern blot analysis detected transcripts of 2.4 and 3.4 kb in
all human tissues examined, with the difference in transcript size due
to use of alternative polyadenylation sites. Highest expression was in
liver, followed by skeletal muscle and kidney. Western blot analysis
detected a 30-kD protein in all tissues and cell lines examined.

GENE FUNCTION

PNPO activity is developmentally regulated in rat liver, being low in
fetal liver and high in adult liver. Ngo et al. (1998) showed that PNPO
expression was similarly developmentally regulated in rat brain.
Additionally, Ngo et al. (1998) demonstrated that, analogous to rodent
hepatomas, PNPO expression in rodent brain tumors was comparable to or
lower than that present in fetal rat brain. However, the human
neuroblastoma cell lines examined displayed variable PNPO activity; a
human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line contained relatively high PNPO
activity, comparable to that found in normal human liver.

Kang et al. (2004) characterized the enzymatic properties of recombinant
PNPO following expression in E. coli. PNPO converted both PNP and
pyridoxamine 5-prime-phosphate to PLP, and the PLP product was an
inhibitor. Mutation analysis indicated that the first N-terminal
conserved helix segment and the C-terminal 25 residues were required for
enzymatic activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kang et al. (2004) determined that the PNPO gene contains 7 exons and
spans 7.7 kb. The promoter region shows characteristics of housekeeping
genes, with a CpG island and Sp1 (189906)-binding sites, but no
TATA-like sequences.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Kang et al. (2004) mapped the PNPO gene to
chromosome 17q21.32. They mapped the mouse gene to chromosome 11.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 5 patients from 3 families with PNPO deficiency (610090), Mills et
al. (2005) identified homozygous missense, splice site, and stop codon
mutations in the PNPO gene. Expression studies in Chinese hamster ovary
cells showed that the splice site (IVS3-1G-A; 603287.0002) and stop
codon (X262Q; 603287.0003) mutations were null activity mutations and
that the missense mutation (R229W; 603287.0001) markedly reduced
pyridox(am)ine phosphate oxidase activity. The authors suggested that
maintenance of optimal PLP levels in the brain may be important in many
neurologic disorders in which neurotransmitter metabolism is disturbed
(either as a primary or as a secondary phenomenon).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PYRIDOXAMINE 5-PRIME-PHOSPHATE OXIDASE DEFICIENCY
PNPO, ARG229TRP

In twin boys, the children of consanguineous Turkish parents, with PNPO
deficiency (610090), Mills et al. (2005) detected a homozygous C-to-T
transition in exon 7 of the PNPO gene, resulting in a substitution of
tryptophan for the conserved arginine-229 residue (R229W). At least 4
and possibly 6 sibs from this family, including the twins, died from the
same disorder. Brautigam et al. (2002) had described the clinical and
laboratory findings in these patients.

.0002
PYRIDOXAMINE 5-PRIME-PHOSPHATE OXIDASE DEFICIENCY
PNPO, IVS3, G-A, -1

In an infant with PNPO deficiency (610090), Mills et al. (2005) found a
splice mutation in intron 3 (IVS3-1G-A) on 1 allele of the PNPO gene.
The missense mutation carried by the other allele was considered to be a
polymorphism. The parents were second cousins of East African Asian
origin. Patient fibroblast mRNA lacked exon 4, confirming aberrant
splicing. This patient was the only one studied by Mills et al. (2005)
to receive PLP treatment and to survive beyond the neonatal period, but
showed persistent central hypotonia and painful dystonic spasms as well
as some seizures by the second year of life. He had marked acquired
microcephaly and moderate to severe developmental delay.

In 2 affected sibs from a consanguineous Pakistani family with PNPO
deficiency (610090), Mills et al. (2005) detected a homozygous T-to-C
transition in exon 7 of the PNPO gene that resulted in substitution of
glutamine for the stop codon at position 262 (X262Q) and the addition of
28 amino acids. Expression studies demonstrated that X262Q PNPO is a

In a male infant with PNPO deficiency (610090), Ruiz et al. (2008)
identified a homozygous 520C-T transition in exon 5 of the PNPO gene,
resulting in an ala174-to-ter (A174X) substitution. The patient had
severe seizures and myoclonus within the first hours of life and died at
age 48 days.

600505	TITLE *600505 CASEIN KINASE I, ALPHA-1; CSNK1A1
;;CK1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Tapia et al. (1994) isolated a cDNA encoding human casein kinase I from
a fetal brain library using PCR primers based on the bovine sequence.
The cDNA was sequenced and shown to have a predicted amino acid sequence
identical to the bovine protein except that it contains 12 additional
amino acids at the carboxyl end.

GENE FUNCTION

Jia et al. (2004) showed that protein kinase A (PKA; see 188830) and
casein kinase I (CKI) regulate Smo (601500) cell surface accumulation
and activity in response to hedgehog (Hh; see 600725). Blocking PKA or
CKI activity in the Drosophila wing disc prevented Hh-induced Smo
accumulation and attenuated pathway activity, whereas increasing PKA
activity promoted Smo accumulation and pathway activation. Jia et al.
(2004) showed that PKA and CKI phosphorylate Smo at several sites, and
that phosphorylation-deficient forms of Smo fail to accumulate on the
cell surface and are unable to transduce the Hh signal. Conversely,
phosphorylation-mimicking Smo variants showed constitutive cell surface
expression and signaling activity. Furthermore, Jia et al. (2004) found
that the levels of Smo cell surface expression and activity correlated
with its levels of phosphorylation. Jia et al. (2004) concluded that Hh
induces progressive Smo phosphorylation by PKA and CKI, leading to
elevation of Smo cell surface levels and signaling activity.

Bidere et al. (2009) conducted parallel screens involving a mass
spectrometry analysis of CARMA1 (607210) binding partners and an RNA
interference screen for growth inhibition of the CBM-dependent
'activated B cell-like' (ABC) subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
(DLBCL; see 605027). Bidere et al. (2009) reported that both screens
identified CK1-alpha as a bifunctional regulator of NF-kappa-B (164011).
CK1-alpha dynamically associates with the CBM complex on T cell receptor
engagement to participate in cytokine production and lymphocyte
proliferation. However, CK1-alpha kinase activity has a contrasting role
by subsequently promoting the phosphorylation and inactivation of
CARMA1. CK1-alpha has thus a dual 'gating' function which first promotes
and then terminates receptor-induced NF-kappa-B. ABC DLBCL cells
required CK1-alpha for constitutive NF-kappa-B activity, indicating that
CK1-alpha functions as a conditionally essential malignancy gene.

Elyada et al. (2011) showed that casein kinase I-alpha, a component of
the beta-catenin (116806) destruction complex, is a critical regulator
of the Wnt signaling (see 164820) pathway. Inducing the ablation of
Csnk1a1 in the gut triggers massive Wnt activation, surprisingly without
causing tumorigenesis. CKI-alpha-deficient epithelium shows many of the
features of human colorectal tumors in addition to Wnt activation, in
particular the induction of the DNA damage response and cellular
senescence, both of which are thought to provide a barrier against
malignant transformation. The epithelial DNA damage response in mice is
accompanied by substantial activation of p53 (191170), suggesting that
the p53 pathway may counteract the protumorigenic effects of Wnt
hyperactivation. Notably, the transition from benign adenomas to
invasive colorectal cancer in humans is typically linked to p53
inactivation, underscoring the importance of p53 as a safeguard against
malignant progression; however, the mechanism of p53-mediated tumor
suppression is unknown. Elyada et al. (2011) showed that the maintenance
of intestinal homeostasis in CKI-alpha-deficient gut requires
p53-mediated growth control, because the combined ablation of Csnk1a1
and either p53 or its target gene p21 (116899) triggered high-grade
dysplasia with extensive proliferation. Unexpectedly, these ablations
also induced nonproliferating cells to invade the villous lamina propria
rapidly, producing invasive carcinomas throughout the small bowel.
Furthermore, in p53-deficient gut, loss of heterozygosity of the gene
encoding CKI-alpha caused a highly invasive carcinoma, indicating that
CKI-alpha caused a highly invasive carcinoma, indicating that CKI-alpha
functions as a tumor suppressor when p53 is inactivated. Elyada et al.
(2011) identified a set of genes (the p53-suppressed invasiveness
signature, PSIS) that is activated by the loss of both p53 and CKI-alpha
and which probably accounts for the brisk induction of invasiveness.
PSIS transcription and tumor invasion were suppressed by p21,
independently of cell cycle control. Restraining tissue invasion through
suppressing PSIS expression is thus a novel tumor suppressor function of
wildtype p53. PROX1 (601546), IFITM2 (605578), and IFITM3 (605579) are
all PSIS genes.

MAPPING

Tapia et al. (1994) identified YAC genomic clones containing the human
gene and used them to map CKI to chromosome 13q13. Fish et al. (1995)
mapped the CSNK1A1 gene to chromosome 13q13.1-q14.1 by FISH. However,
Gross (2011) mapped the CSNK1A1 gene to chromosome 5q32 based on an
alignment of the CSNK1A1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC008717) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

605832	TITLE *605832 ACETYL-CoA SYNTHETASE SHORT CHAIN FAMILY, MEMBER 2; ACSS2
;;ACS;;
ACETATE-CoA LIGASE;;
ACYL-CoA SYNTHETASE 1; ACECS1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Fatty acids are incorporated into membranes and signaling molecules and
have roles in energy storage and metabolism. These essential functions
require activation of the fatty acid by acyl-coenzyme A (CoA)
synthetases, such as ACSS2, which form an activating thioester linkage
between the fatty acid and CoA (Watkins et al., 2007).

CLONING

Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs; see 184756) are
transcription factors that activate genes required for the synthesis of
cholesterol and unsaturated fatty acids. By use of a suppressive
subtractive hybridization technique, Luong et al. (2000) identified a
cDNA clone regulated by SREBPs. The cDNA shows sequence homology to the
yeast acetyl-CoA synthetase gene (ACS) and encodes a cytosolic enzyme
(EC 6.2.1.13) that catalyzes the activation of acetate for use in lipid
synthesis or energy generation. The ACS protein contains 701 amino acids
and is predicted to have a molecular mass of 78.5 kD and an isoelectric
point of 6.27. ACS shares 93%, 66%, and 45% sequence identity with the
mouse, Drosophila, and S. cerevisiae ACS proteins, respectively.
Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues detected ACS expression at
highest levels in liver and kidney and at lower levels in heart, brain,
and testis.

Fujino et al. (2001) cloned mouse Acss1 (614355) and Acss2, which they
called Acecs1 and Acecs2, respectively. The deduced 682-amino acid Acss2
protein shares 45.8% identity with Acss1. Northern blot analysis
detected a 4.4-kb Acss2 transcript in all mouse tissues examined except
liver, with highest expression in heart. Fractionation of mouse kidney
revealed cytosolic localization for Acss1 and mitochondrial localization
for Acss2.

By database analysis, Watkins et al. (2007) identified a splice variant
of human ACSS2 that encodes a 651-amino acid protein that differs from
full-length ACSS2 at the N terminus.

GENE FUNCTION

Using purified recombinant ACS, Luong et al. (2000) demonstrated that
ACS functions as a monomer. Recombinant enzyme produced acetyl-CoA from
acetate in a reaction that required ATP. Using cell lines and transgenic
mice expressing forms of SREBP, Luong et al. (2000) demonstrated an
SREBP-mediated increase in ACS transcription. Using tissue culture cells
and cell-free extracts, they demonstrated that ACS transcription
increased when SREBPs entered the nucleus in response to cholesterol
deprivation, and that this increase was prevented when SREBP activation
was blocked with sterols. The authors noted that ACS transcription was
maintained at a significant basal level even when SREBPs were absent
from the nucleus.

By assaying proteins purified from transfected COS-7 cells, Fujino et
al. (2001) showed that both mouse Acss1 and Acss2 preferred acetate as
substrate for the synthesis of acetyl-CoA. Little to no activity was
detected toward other short or medium chain fatty acids. Acss1
expression, but not Acss2 expression, was induced by differentiation of
mouse 3T3-L1 cells. In contrast, Acss2 expression, but not Acss1
expression, was induced by fasting in mice and by diabetes in Zucker
rats. Radiolabeled acetate was incorporated into CO2 by COS-7 cells
expressing mouse Acss2. Fujino et al. (2001) concluded that the major
function of ACSS2 is to produce acetyl-CoA for oxidation through the
tricarboxylic acid cycle to produce ATP and CO2 in the mitochondrial
matrix.

GENE STRUCTURE

Watkins et al. (2007) determined that the ACSS2 gene contains 19 exons,
including alternative first exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Watkins et al. (2007) mapped the ACSS2
gene to the plus strand of chromosome 20q11.22.

;;SARCOPLASMIC RETICULUM Ca(2+)-ATPase 1; SERCA1
SERCA1 TRUNCATED ISOFORM, INCLUDED; S1T, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The function of calcium-transporting ATPase found in different membranes
is to lower cytoplasmic Ca(2+) concentration by pumping Ca(2+) to
luminal or extracellular spaces. Although there had long been evidence
of differences between the Ca(2+) ATPase found in fast-twitch skeletal
muscle fibers and those of slow-twitch/cardiac fibers, the differences
were not clarified until cDNAs encoding the 2 forms were cloned and
sequenced (Brandl et al., 1986). The proteins share 84% amino acid
sequence identity and 76% nucleic acid sequence homology. Coding for
these 2 proteins is clearly carried out by different genes which are
presumably related to one another by an ancient gene duplication event.

Zhang et al. (1995) isolated and characterized genomic DNA and cDNA
encoding human ATP2A1. The deduced 994-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 109 kD and contains 10 putative
transmembrane segments.

Chami et al. (2001) stated that an adult SERCA1 variant, SERCA1A, has a
stop codon in exon 22, whereas a fetal variant, SERCA1B, lacks exon 22
and has a stop codon in exon 23. By screening a liver cDNA library, they
identified 2 additional splice variants, S1T+4 and S1T-4. Both S1T
variants lack exon 11, but S1T-4 also lacks exon 4. Splicing of exon 11
in both variants leads to a frameshift that introduces a stop codon in
exon 12, resulting in C-terminally truncated proteins that lack
transmembrane segments 5 through 10, which include 6 of the 7
Ca(2+)-binding residues found in full-length SERCA1. The S1T proteins
are therefore predicted to lack the ability to pump Ca(2+). RT-PCR
analysis detected full-length SERCA1 in most adult and fetal tissues
examined, including adult brain, but not fetal brain. S1T transcripts
were detected in adult pancreas, liver, kidney, lung, and placenta and
in fetal kidney, liver, brain, and thymus, but not in adult skeletal
muscle, heart, and brain or in fetal skeletal muscle and heart. In
brain, expression appeared to switch from S1T in the fetus to SERCA1 in
the adult. Western blot analysis detected S1T and SERCA1 at 46 and 110
kD, respectively. S1T appeared to form homodimers and colocalized with
SERCA2B (ATP2A2; 108740) in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes.

GENE FUNCTION

Chami et al. (2001) found that overexpression of S1T proteins in several
human cell lines induced apoptosis and reduced steady-state Ca (2+)
levels in the ER and increased ER Ca(2+) leakage. In cotransfection
experiments, S1T proteins consistently reduced the higher steady state
Ca(2+) level in ER following SERCA1 or SERCA2B overexpression. Chami et
al. (2001) concluded that the S1T isoforms modulate full-length
SERCA-dependent Ca(2+) accumulation into the ER and have a role in
apoptosis.

Chami et al. (2008) found that overexpression of S1T, but not
full-length SERCA1, induced ER stress in HeLa cells and amplified ER
stress through the PERK (EIF2AK3; 604032)-EIF2A (609234)-ATF4
(604064)-CHOP (DDIT3; 126337) pathway. S1T1 increased ER Ca(2+) leak,
increased the number of contact sites between the ER and mitochondria,
and inhibited mitochondria movements. These changes led to increased
Ca(2+) transfer to mitochondria in both resting and stimulated cells and
activated the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. S1T knockdown prevented
ER stress, mitochondrial Ca(2+) overload, and subsequent apoptosis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhang et al. (1995) determined that the human ATP2A1 gene is 26 kb long
and contains 23 exons, 1 of which can be alternatively spliced. The
locations of each of the exon/intron boundaries are the same as those
previously identified in the rabbit ATP2A1 gene.

MAPPING

MacLennan et al. (1987) found that a rabbit cDNA for the fast-twitch
ATPase hybridizes to a prominent single fragment in human genomic DNA
digested with the restriction enzyme BamHI. By correlating the presence
of this fragment in somatic cell hybrid DNA with the human chromosome
content of the hybrids, they assigned the fast-twitch ATPase gene to
human chromosome 16.

During the course of mapping the gene for Batten disease (204200) to
16p12.1-p11.2 (607042), Callen et al. (1991) mapped ATP2A to the same
region just distal to the fragile site FRA16E. This was accomplished by
physical mapping of markers linked to CLN3 and ATP2A using somatic cell
hybrid analysis and in situ hybridization.

Schleef et al. (1996) mapped the Atp2a1 gene to mouse chromosome 7 by
analysis of an interspecific backcross.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

MacLennan et al. (1987) suggested that the ATP2A1 gene, located on
chromosome 16, may be the site of the mutation in Brody myopathy
(601003), an unusual, apparently familial disorder characterized by
increasing impairment of muscular relaxation during exercise (Brody,
1969). A deficiency of Ca(2+) transport ATPase activity in the
sarcoplasmic reticulum of fast-twitch but not slow-twitch skeletal
muscle had been demonstrated (Karpati et al., 1986).

Zhang et al. (1995) sequenced the exons of the ATP2A1 gene in the
patient shown by Karpati et al. (1986) to be deficient in SERCA1 protein
and Ca(2+)-ATPase activity in type 2 muscle fibers and found no
mutation. They also sequenced full-length cDNAs for SERCA1 in 2 other,
unrelated Brody patients; again, no sequence abnormality was discovered.
In all 3 cases, the coding and splice junction sequences were normal.

Odermatt et al. (1996) demonstrated mutations in the ATP2A1 gene in 2
families with autosomal recessive inheritance of Brody myopathy. One
mutation occurred in the splice donor site of intron 3 (108730.0003),
while the other 2 mutations (108730.0001, 108730.0002) led to premature
stop codons, truncating SERCA1 and deleting essential functional
domains. This raised the question of how patients with Brody myopathy
partially compensate for functional knockout of a gene product believed
to be essential for fast-twitch skeletal muscle relaxation.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

In muscle, an action potential is associated with an influx of Na(+) and
an efflux of K(+). This depolarization of the sarcolemma induces a
Ca(2+) release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) into the cytosol,
causing muscle contraction. After excitation of skeletal muscle,
ATP-dependent ion pumps restore the disturbed ion homeostasis. SR
Ca(2+)-ATPase transports Ca(2+) from the cytosol into the lumen of the
SR, and Na(+)/K(+)-dependent ATPase re-uptakes K(+) from the
interstitial fluid into the muscle and releases Na(+). Referring to the
fast-twitch muscle cytoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase isoform as
SERCA1, Benders et al. (1994) studied its activity in both quadriceps
muscle and cultured muscle cells. The enzyme activity was decreased by
approximately 50% in patients with Brody myopathy. The concentration of
the protein was normal, however, implying reduction in the molecular
activity of SERCA1 in Brody disease.

- Crystal Structure

Toyoshima et al. (2004) reported at 2.3-angstrom resolution the
structure of SERCA1, a representative P-type ATPase that is crystallized
in the absence of calcium but in the presence of magnesium fluoride, a
stable phosphate analog. This and other crystal structures provided
atomic models for all 4 principal states in the reaction cycle. These
structures showed that the 3 cytoplasmic domains rearrange to move 6 of
10 transmembrane helices, thereby changing the affinity of the
calcium-binding sites and the gating of the ion pathway. Release of ADP
triggers the opening of the luminal gate and release of phosphate its
closure, effected mainly through movement of the A-domain, the actuator
of transmembrane gates.

Olesen et al. (2004) determined the crystal structure of rabbit
sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase in complex with aluminum fluoride,
which mimics the transition state of hydrolysis of the counterion-bound
(protonated) phosphoenzyme. On the basis of structural analysis and
biochemical data, Olesen et al. (2004) found this form to represent an
occluded state of the proton counterions. Hydrolysis is catalyzed by the
conserved thr-gly-glu-ser motif, and exploits an associative
nucleophilic reaction mechanism of the same type as phosphoryl transfer
from ATP.

Olesen et al. (2007) presented functional studies and 3 new crystal
structures of the rabbit skeletal muscle Ca(2+)-ATPase (Serca1a),
representing the phosphoenzyme intermediates associated with Ca(2+)
binding, Ca(2+) translocation, and dephosphorylation, that are based on
complexes with a functional ATP analog, beryllium fluoride, and aluminum
fluoride, respectively. The structures complete study of the cycle of
nucleotide binding and cation transport of Ca(2+)-ATPase.
Phosphorylation of the enzyme triggers the onset of a conformational
change that leads to the opening of a luminal exit pathway defined by
the transmembrane segments M1 through M6, which represent the canonical
membrane domain of P-type pumps. Ca(2+) release is promoted by
translocation of the M4 helix, exposing glu309, glu771, and asn796 to
the lumen. Olesen et al. (2007) concluded that the mechanism explains
how P-type ATPases are able to form the steep electrochemical gradients
required for key functions in eukaryotic cells.

Toyoshima et al. (2013) described the crystal structure of native
Serca1a from rabbit in the E1-Mg(2+) state at 3.0-angstrom resolution in
addition to crystal structures of Serca1a in E2 free from exogenous
inhibitors, and addressed the structural basis of the activation signal
for phosphoryl transfer. Unexpectedly, sarcolipin (602203), a small
regulatory membrane protein of Ca(2+)-ATPase, is bound, stabilizing the
E1-Mg(2+) state. Sarcolipin is a close homolog of phospholamban
(172405), which is a critical mediator of beta-adrenergic signal in
calcium regulation in heart and seems to play an important role in
muscle-based thermogenesis. Toyoshima et al. (2013) also determined the
crystal structure of recombinant Serca1a devoid of sarcolipin, and
described the structural basis of inhibition by
sarcolipin/phospholamban.

Winther et al. (2013) reported the crystal structure of rabbit Serca1a
in complex with sarcolipin at 3.1-angstrom resolution. The regulatory
sarcolipin traps the Ca(2+)-ATPase in a previously undescribed E1 state,
with exposure of the Ca(2+) sites through an open cytoplasmic pathway
stabilized by Mg(2+). This structure suggested a mechanism for selective
Ca(2+) loading and activation of SERCA, and provided insight into how
sarcolipin and phospholamban inhibition arises from stabilization of
this E1 intermediate state without bound Ca(2+).

ANIMAL MODEL

Pan et al. (2003) found that Serca1-null mice were born at predicted
mendelian ratios. However, in contrast to humans lacking SERCA1,
Serca1-null mice had progressive cyanosis and gasping respiration and
succumbed from respiratory failure shortly after birth. The lungs of
mutant mice revealed diffuse congestion and epithelial hypercellularity,
and the diaphragm muscles showed prominent hypercontracted regions in
scattered fibers and increased fiber size variability. The Vmax of
Ca(2+) transport in mutant diaphragm and skeletal muscle was reduced by
80% compared with wildtype muscle, and the contractile response to
electrical stimulation under physiologic conditions was reduced. There
were no compensatory increases in other Ca(2+)-handling proteins.

Gehrig et al. (2012) showed that increasing the expression of
intramuscular heat-shock protein-72 (HSP72; 140550) preserves muscle
strength and ameliorates the dystrophic pathology in 2 mouse models of
muscular dystrophy. Treatment with BGP-15, a pharmacologic inducer of
Hsp72 that can protect against obesity-induced insulin resistance,
improved muscular architecture, strength, and contractile function in
severely affected diaphragm muscles in mdx dystrophic mice. In dko mice,
a phenocopy of DMD that results in severe kyphosis, muscle weakness, and
premature death, BGP-15 decreased kyphosis, improved the dystrophic
pathophysiology in limb and diaphragm muscles, and extended life span.
Gehrig et al. (2012) found that Serca is dysfunctional in severely
affected muscles of mdx and dko mice, and that Hsp72 interacts with
Serca to preserve its function under conditions of stress, ultimately
contributing to the decreased muscle degeneration seen with Hsp72
upregulation. Treatment with BGP-15 similarly increased Serca activity
in dystrophic skeletal muscles. Gehrig et al. (2012) concluded that
their results provided evidence that increasing the expression of Hsp72
in muscle (through the administration of BGP-15) has significant
therapeutic potential for DMD and related conditions, either as a
self-contained therapy or as an adjuvant with other potential
treatments, including gene, cell, and pharmacologic therapies.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
BRODY MYOPATHY
ATP2A1, ARG198TER

In a family with 3 individuals affected with autosomal recessive Brody
myopathy (601003), Odermatt et al. (1996) found that although no
consanguinity was known in the family the parents contained the same
haplotype for the 6.6-cM interval between markers D16S288 and D16S304.
The affected patients inherited this common haplotype from each parent.
A C-to-T transition of nucleotide 592 was found, resulting in a change
of codon 198 from CGA (arg) to TGA (stop). The authors stated that the
truncated product would be devoid of phosphorylation, nucleotide
binding, and Ca(2+) binding domains.

.0002
BRODY MYOPATHY
ATP2A1, CYS675TER

In a family with 2 sibs affected by Brody myopathy (601003), Odermatt et
al. (1996) demonstrated that the affected brothers were compound
heterozygotes for a cys675-to-ter (C675X) mutation and a mutation of the
invariant GT dinucleotide to CT at the splice donor site of intron 3 of
the maternally inherited chromosome (108730.0003). The paternally
inherited C675X mutation was predicted to lead to a truncated protein of
674 amino acids. The truncated gene product was predicted to contain
phosphorylation and nucleotide binding domains, but the Ca(2+) binding
domain would be disrupted. The maternally inherited splice mutation was
predicted to lead to the preferential skipping of exon 3 and less
frequently to partial retention of intron 3. If exon 2 were spliced to
exon 4 and transcribed, the product would be truncated; if intron 3 were
partially retained and transcribed, the product would also be truncated.
Both gene products would be missing phosphorylation, nucleotide binding,
and Ca(2+) binding domains.

See 108730.0002 and Odermatt et al. (1996).

.0004
BRODY MYOPATHY
ATP2A1, 1-BP DEL, 437C

In 2 brothers with Brody myopathy (601003) who had first-cousin parents
and an identical haplotype in homozygous state at the ATP2A1 locus,
Odermatt et al. (1997) identified a deletion of a C in a series of 3 Cs
(cDNA nucleotides 437 to 439) of the ATP2A1 gene. This deletion caused a
homozygous frameshift at pro147, which led to a stop codon in both
transcripts after the incorporation of 33 additional amino acids. This
was the fourth mutation described in autosomal recessive Brody disease;
3 of the 4 mutations resulted in truncation.

.0005
BRODY MYOPATHY
ATP2A1, PRO789LEU

In an analysis of the ATP2A1 gene in 4 unrelated families with autosomal
recessive Brody disease, Odermatt et al. (2000) found 3 mutations in 2
families, leading to premature stop codons and truncated SERCA1. In a
third family, a missense pro789-to-leu (P789L) mutation due to
homozygous substitution of T for the 2366C nucleotide was found. The
mutant form was readily expressed in HEK293 cells, but it demonstrated
an almost complete loss of Ca(2+) transport activity because of reduced
Ca(2+) affinity. This was the first report of a missense mutation
causing Brody myopathy.

The family with the pro789-to-leu mutation reported by Odermatt et al.
(2000) was Swiss. The parents were first cousins and were heterozygous
carriers. Two brothers were homozygous affected. A sister was an
asymptomatic carrier of the mutation. The proband was first brought to
medical attention at the age of 5, because of inability to run as well
as his friends. Thereafter, he was aware that muscle stiffness occurred
during vigorous or sudden rapid movements, such as climbing stairs and
running, or during rotational movements of his hands. The stiffness was
painless and disappeared after several seconds at rest. A single episode
of unexplained hyperthermia, which led to hospitalization for 48 hours,
occurred during a journey in his twenties, but several episodes of
unknown raised temperature were also described. A few episodes of
carpopedal spasms had been observed, leading to the diagnosis of
Gitelman syndrome (263800). His brother's earliest recollection of a
disorder of muscle function was his inability to run in races at the age
of 4 to 5 years. He had the same range of activities as his peers, but
could not do them as quickly because he found that rapid movements
forced him to stop. Neurologic examination in both brothers was normal
except for slow relaxation of limb and face muscles.

606722	TITLE *606722 NEUROCALCIN, DELTA; NCALD
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NCALD is a member of the EF-hand calcium-binding protein superfamily.

CLONING

Wang et al. (2001) cloned human NCALD from a fetal brain cDNA library.
The deduced 194-amino acid protein, with a calculated molecular mass of
22 kD, shares 100% and 99% sequence homology with the bovine and chicken
neurocalcins, respectively. The protein contains 2 pairs of EF-hand
calcium-binding loop sequences and a consensus myristoylation signal at
the N terminus.

By Northern blot analysis, Wang et al. (2001) detected a major NCALD
message of approximately 3.5 kb at highest levels in brain and at lower
levels in testis, ovary, and small intestine. They detected a minor
message of approximately 1 kb in heart and testis. Tissue in situ
hybridization demonstrated expression in almost all cell layers of the
seminiferous tubules, suggesting the involvement of NCALD in the whole
process of spermatogenesis.

GENE FUNCTION

Based on the high conservation of neurocalcin in evolution, Wang et al.
(2001) suggested that NCALD plays an important role in the regulation of
the neuronal signal transduction process.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wang et al. (2001) determined that the NCALD gene contains 6 exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Wang et al. (2001) mapped the NCALD gene
between markers D8S270 and D8S257 on chromosome 8q22.2.

;;COILED-COIL DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 56; CCDC56;;
MITOCHONDRIAL TRANSLATION REGULATION ASSEMBLY INTERMEDIATE OF   CYTOCHROME
c OXIDASE 12; MITRAC12
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching a human database for sequences similar to Drosophila
Ccdc56, Peralta et al. (2012) identified COA3, which they called CCDC56.
The deduced 106-amino acid protein contains a central single pass
transmembrane domain and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain. Human CCDC56
shares 42% identity with the Drosophila protein. Database analysis
revealed conservation of CCDC56 in metazoans, but not in yeast or
plants.

Using database analysis and protein profiling to identify human
orthologs of yeast cytochrome c oxidase (COX) assembly proteins,
Szklarczyk et al. (2012) independently identified COA3.

Mick et al. (2012) found that disruption of mitochondrial outer
membranes in HEK293 cells led to exposure of the MITRAC12 C terminus,
suggesting that MITRAC12 is an inner mitochondrial membrane protein with
its C terminus exposed to the intermembrane space.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Peralta et al. (2012) mapped the COA3 gene
to chromosome 17q21.31.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoprecipitation analysis of HEK293 cells, Mick et al. (2012)
found that MITRAC12 associated with the cytochrome c oxidase assembly
protein SURF1 (185620) and with COX1 (MTCO1; 516030), a subunit of
respiratory complex IV. Depletion of MITRAC12 in HEK293 cells via small
interfering RNA resulted in a growth defect, reduced content of newly
synthesized complex IV, and reduced cytochrome c oxidase activity.
Quantitative affinity purification and mass spectrometry showed that
MITRAC12 interacted with central complex IV subunits and with several
complex IV assembly factors.

ANIMAL MODEL

Peralta et al. (2012) found that homozygous Ccdc56 knockout in
Drosophila resulted in developmental delay, followed by arrest at the
third larval stage and death before pupariation. The main biochemical
phenotype was severe isolated COX complex IV deficiency.

601900	TITLE *601900 INTERFERON REGULATORY FACTOR 4; IRF4
;;LYMPHOCYTE-SPECIFIC IRF; LSIRF;;
MULTIPLE MYELOMA ONCOGENE 1; MUM1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

IRF4 is a transcription factor essential for the development of T
helper-2 (Th2) cells, IL17 (see 603149)-producing Th17 cells, and IL9
(146931)-producing Th9 cells (Staudt et al., 2010).

CLONING

Grossman et al. (1996) cloned a novel human interferon regulatory factor
(IRF) that they named LSIRF for 'lymphocyte-specific IRF.' They reported
that the gene encodes a 450-amino acid polypeptide with a predicted mass
of 51.6 kD. The gene is expressed as a single 5-kb transcript in spleen,
lymphocytes, and melanocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

Grossman et al. (1996) found that expression of LSIRF was induced in T
cells after crosslinking of the T-cell receptor (see 186880).

By fluorescence and confocal microscopy, Negishi et al. (2005)
demonstrated that IRF4 interacted with MYD88 (602170) in the cytoplasm
of human embryonic kidney cells. Mutation and coimmunoprecipitation
analysis showed that IRF4 interacted with the TIR/IL1 region of MYD88.
IRF4 inhibited interaction of MYD88 with IRF5 (607218), which interacts
with the same central region of MYD88 as IRF4, but it did not block
interaction of MYD88 with IRF7 (605047), which binds to the N terminus.
IRF5-dependent gene induction was inhibited by IRF4, and IRF4-deficient
macrophages were hyperresponsive to Toll-like receptor (TLR; see 603030)
stimuli. Negishi et al. (2005) concluded that IRF4 negatively regulates
TLR signaling by selectively competing with IRF5.

Shaffer et al. (2008) used a loss-of-function, RNA interference-based
genetic screen to demonstrate that IRF4 inhibition is toxic to myeloma
cell lines, regardless of transforming oncogenic mechanism. Gene
expression profiling and genomewide chromatin immunoprecipitation
analysis uncovered an extensive network of IRF4 target genes and
identified MYC (190080) as a direct target of IRF4 in activated B cells
and myeloma. Unexpectedly, IRF4 was itself a direct target of MYC
transactivation, generating an autoregulatory circuit in myeloma cells.
Shaffer et al. (2008) suggested that although IRF4 is not genetically
altered in most myelomas, they are nonetheless addicted to an aberrant
IRF4 regulatory network that fuses the gene expression programs of
normal plasma cells and activated B cells.

Zheng et al. (2009) showed that in mouse T regulatory cells, high
amounts of IRF4, a transcription factor essential for TH2 effector cell
differentiation, is dependent on Foxp3 (300292) expression. They
proposed that IRF4 expression endows T regulatory cells with the ability
to suppress TH2 responses. Indeed, ablation of a conditional Irf4 allele
in T regulatory cells resulted in selective dysregulation of TH2
responses, IL4-dependent immunoglobulin isotype production, and tissue
lesions with pronounced plasma cell infiltration, in contrast to the
mononuclear cell-dominated pathology typical of mice lacking T
regulatory cells. Zheng et al. (2009) concluded that T regulatory cells
use components of the transcriptional machinery, promoting a particular
type of effector CD4+ T cell differentiation, to efficiently restrain
the corresponding type of the immune response.

Staudt et al. (2010) found that Cd4 (186940)-positive T cells from Irf4
-/- mice failed to differentiate into Il9-producing Th9 cells in the
presence of Tgfb (190180) and Il4 (147780). Treatment of Cd4-positive T
cells with Irf4 small interfering RNA strongly reduced Il9 production
and enhanced Ifng (147570) expression, but had no effect on Il2 (147680)
production. Reporter gene analysis demonstrated that Irf4 bound directly
to the Il9 promoter. Naive human CD4-positive T cells stimulated with
IL4 and TGFB also differentiated into Th9 cells, and this was
accompanied by strong expression of IRF4. Staudt et al. (2010) concluded
that IRF4 is essential for development of Th9 cells.

By flow cytometric analysis, Cretney et al. (2011) demonstrated that
Blimp1 (PRDM1; 603423) was expressed in a subset of mouse regulatory T
cells (Tregs) that localized mainly to mucosal sites and expressed Il10
(124092) in a Blimp1-dependent manner. Blimp1 was also required for
tissue homeostasis. Irf4, but not Tbet (TBX21; 604895), was essential
for Blimp1 expression and for differentiation of all effector Tregs.
Cretney et al. (2011) concluded that the differentiation pathway that
leads to the acquisition of Treg effector functions requires both IRF4
and BLIMP1.

Li et al. (2012) showed that in mouse CD4+ T cells and B cells IRF4
unexpectedly can cooperate with activator protein-1 (AP1; see 165160)
complexes to bind to AP1-IRF4 composite (5-prime-TGAnTCA/GAAA-3-prime)
motifs that they denoted as AP1-IRF composite elements (AICEs).
Moreover, BATF-JUN family protein complexes cooperate with IRF4 in
binding to AICEs in preactivated CD4+ T cells stimulated with IL21
(605384) and in TH17 differentiated cells. Importantly, BATF (612476)
binding was diminished in Irf4-null T cells and IRF4 binding was
diminished in Batf-null T cells, consistent with functional cooperation
between these factors. Moreover, Li et al. (2012) showed that AP1 and
IRF complexes cooperatively promote transcription of the Il10 gene,
which is expressed in TH17 cells and potently regulated by IL21. Li et
al. (2012) concluded that their findings revealed that IRF4 can signal
via complexes containing ETS or AP1 motifs depending on the cellular
context.

Using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing in T-helper-17 (TH17)
cells, Glasmacher et al. (2012) found that IRF4 targets sequences
enriched for activated protein-1 (AP1; 165160)-IRF composite elements
(AICEs) that are cobound by BATF (612476), an AP1 factor required for
TH17, B, and dendritic cell differentiation. IRF4 and BATF bind
cooperatively to structurally divergent AICEs to promote gene activation
and TH17 differentiation. The AICE motif directs assembly of IRF4 or
IRF8 (601565) with BATF heterodimers and is also used in TH2, B, and
dendritic cells. Glasmacher et al. (2012) concluded that this genomic
regulatory element and cognate factors appear to have evolved to
integrate diverse immunomodulatory signals.

MAPPING

Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, Grossman et al. (1996) mapped
the LSIRF gene to chromosome 6p25-p23.

- Association with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia

In a genomewide association study to identify common variants
influencing the risk of developing chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL;
see 151400), Di Bernardo et al. (2008) found the strongest association
with 2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that mapped to a 97-kb
block of linkage disequilibrium on chromosome 6p25.3 (CLLS4; 612558)
that contains the IRF4 gene. The SNP dbSNP rs872071 maps within the
3-prime untranslated region of IRF4. The overall estimate of effect
associated with dbSNP rs872071 was an odds ratio trend of 1.54 with a
95% confidence interval of 1.41 to 1.69 and a P value of 1.91 x 10(-20).
The genotype at SNP dbSNP rs872071 was sufficient to capture all of the
locus variation. Di Bernardo et al. (2008) considered IRF4 a strong
candidate gene for a CLL susceptibility a priori, being a key regulator
of lymphocyte development and proliferation. In studies using
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphocytes, expression of IRF4
mRNA was significantly associated with genotype in a dose-dependent
fashion (P = 0.042), with lower expression associated with risk alleles.
Di Bernardo et al. (2008) argued that this observation is consistent
with a model in which the causal variant influences risk by arresting
transition of memory B cells through decreased IRF4 expression.

Using a set of SNP markers, Crowther-Swanepoel et al. (2010) generated a
fine-scale map of 6p25.3 and narrowed the signal for association with
CLL to an 18-kb DNA segment within the 3-prime untranslated region (UTR)
of IRF4. Resequencing this segment in European subjects identified 55
common polymorphisms, including 13 highly correlated candidate causal
variants. In a large case-control study, it was shown that all but 4
variants could be excluded with 95% confidence. These 4 SNPs mapped to a
3-kb region of the 3-prime UTR of IRF4, consistent with the causal basis
of the association being differential IRF4 expression.

CYTOGENETICS

In multiple myeloma (254500), chromosomal translocations affecting 14q32
and unidentified partner chromosomes are common, suggesting that they
may cause the activation of novel oncogenes. In multiple myeloma cell
lines, Iida et al. (1997) identified a t(6;14)(p25;q32) translocation in
2 of 11 cell lines. The translocation juxtaposes the immunoglobulin
heavy-chain (IGHG1; 147100) locus to the MUM1 (for 'multiple myeloma
oncogene 1') gene, which is also referred to as interferon regulatory
factor-4 (IRF4), a member of a gene family known to be active in the
control of B-cell proliferation and differentiation. See IRF1 (147575)
on chromosome 5 and IRF2 (147576) on chromosome 4. As a result of the
translocation, the MUM1/IRF4 gene is overexpressed, an event that may
contribute to tumorigenesis, as Iida et al. (1997) showed that MUM1/IRF4
has oncogenic activity in vitro.

ANIMAL MODEL

By knocking out exons 2 and 3 of the Irf4 gene, Mittrucker et al. (1997)
generated mice deficient in Irf4 protein. Flow cytometric analysis
indicated normal expression of bone marrow and immature B-lymphocyte
markers. After 4 to 5 weeks of age, the mutant mice began to develop
generalized lymphadenopathy with expansion of both T and B lymphocytes,
failed to develop germinal centers in B-cell follicles or plasma cells
after immunization, had poor T- and B-lymphocyte proliferative responses
after stimulation with most mitogens, lacked production of all serum Ig
subclasses after immunization with T cell-dependent or -independent
antigens, and were unable to reject mastocytoma cells. Mittrucker et al.
(1997) concluded that IRF4 is essential for mature T- and B-lymphocyte
function.

Negishi et al. (2005) found that mice lacking Irf4 displayed a more
potent and lethal inflammatory response to CpG oligonucleotides,
underscoring the role of IRF4 as a critical negative regulator of TLR
signaling.

Honma et al. (2005) showed that Irf4 -/- mice were sensitive to TLR
stimulation, such as lipopolysaccharide-induced shock. Irf4 -/-
macrophages produced high levels of Tnf (191160) and Il6 (147620) in
response to TLR ligands. Small interfering RNA against Irf4 in normal
macrophages inhibited the inflammatory response. Honma et al. (2005)
concluded that IRF4 negatively regulates TLR signaling and inhibits
proinflammatory cytokine production.

Staudt et al. (2010) found that transfer of either Th2 or Th9 cells to
Rag2 (179616)-deficient mice resulted in severe asthma symptoms. In mice
that had received Th9 cells, but not Th2 cells, these symptoms could be
relieved with anti-Il9. Mice lacking Irf4, which is essential for Th9
cell development, were resistant to development of asthma, while Irf4
+/- heterozygotes had an intermediate phenotype. Staudt et al. (2010)
concluded that Th9 cell-derived IL9 is an important inducer of asthmatic
symptoms, equivalent to that caused by Th2 cells and IL4.
