SYNTROPHIN-LIKE; SNTL
DESCRIPTION The syntrophin family of dystrophin (300377)-associated proteins
consists of 3 isoforms, alpha-1 (601017), beta-1 (600026), and beta-2,
each encoded by a distinct gene. Each syntrophin has approximately 50%
amino acid identity with the other 2. The 3 syntrophins can be separated
into 2 classes based on isoelectric point: the acidic isoform,
alpha-1-syntrophin (pI = 6.7) and the 2 basic forms, beta-1 and beta-2
(pI = 9.0). Adams et al. (1995) cloned the mouse beta-2-syntrophin gene,
which they found to be 33 kb long with 7 exons, all of which have
homologs at the corresponding position in the alpha-1-syntrophin gene.
Primer extension analysis revealed a single transcription initiation
site in the beta-2 gene.

Ahn et al. (1996) found that the deduced amino acid sequences of human
beta-2-syntrophin and alpha-1-syntrophin are nearly identical to their
homologs in mouse, suggesting a strong functional conservation among the
individual isoforms. Much like beta-1-syntrophin, human
beta-2-syntrophin has multiple transcript classes and is expressed
widely, although in a distinct pattern of relative abundance. In
contrast, human alpha-1-syntrophin is most abundant in heart and
skeletal muscle, and less so in other tissues.

By analysis of interspecific backcrosses, Adams et al. (1995) mapped the
mouse Sntb2 gene to chromosome 8. By Southern blot analysis of
hamster/human somatic cell hybrid DNAs, they mapped the human SNTB2 gene
to chromosome 16. By PCR analysis of somatic cell hybrids and
fluorescence in situ hybridization, Ahn et al. (1996) localized the
SNTB2 gene to 16q22-q23.

;;KIAA1951
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2001) cloned ZNF526, which they designated
KIAA1951. The cDNA has several repetitive elements in its 3-prime UTR.
The deduced protein contains 679 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA detected
variable ZNF526 expression in all adult and fetal tissues and specific
adult brain regions examined. Highest expression was in ovary, followed
by lung, pancreas, spleen, testis, spinal cord, and fetal liver.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the ZNF526 gene to chromosome 19q13.2 based on an
alignment of the ZNF526 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB075831) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;PEX11-GAMMA
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By genomic sequence analysis and EST database searching using PEX11B
(603867) as query, Li et al. (2002) identified PEX11G and obtained the
full-length human and mouse cDNAs. Both human and mouse PEX11G contain
241 amino acids. Phylogenic analysis determined that PEX11G represents a
subfamily of PEX11 proteins distinct from the branch that includes
PEX11A (603866) and PEX11B. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues
detected tissue-specific expression, with high levels in liver and much
lower levels in other tissues. Pex11g expression was below the level of
detection in mouse fibroblasts. Transfection of epitope-tagged PEX11G
into a human fibroblast cell line revealed colocalization with PEX14
(601791), a peroxisome marker protein. Analysis of PEX11G domains
detected in permeabilized cells suggested that PEX11G is a peroxisomal
membrane protein with both the N and C termini exposed to the cytoplasm.

Using homology with PEX11A, Tanaka et al. (2003) identified PEX11G. They
cloned the full-length PEX11G cDNA by RT-PCR of fibroblasts from a
patient with peroxisome biogenesis disorder, complementation group 11
(601757). The deduced 241-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of about 27 kD. PEX11G contains 2 membrane-spanning segments. By
differential permeabilization, Tanaka et al. (2003) confirmed that the N
and C termini of PEX11G are exposed to the cytosol.

GENE FUNCTION

Li et al. (2002) found that Pex11g expression in mouse liver was not
induced by ciprofibrate, and no change in Pex11g expression was detected
in cells lacking either Pex11a or Pex11b. Overexpression of PEX11G did
not increase peroxisome abundance, but induced tubulation, enlargement,
and clustering of peroxisomes.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Tanaka et al. (2003) mapped the PEX11G
gene to chromosome 19p13.3.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

HIV-1 Vpu interacts with CD4 (186940) in the endoplasmic reticulum and
triggers CD4 degradation, presumably by proteasomes. Margottin et al.
(1998) identified a human beta-transducin repeat-containing protein
(BTRCP), consisting of 569 amino acids, that interacts with Vpu and
connects CD4 to the proteolytic machinery. The human BTRCP is homologous
to Xenopus bTrCP1, yeast Met30, and Neurospora Scon2 proteins.
CD4-Vpu-BTRCP complexes have been detected by coimmunoprecipitation.
BTRCP-binding to Vpu and its recruitment to membranes require 2
phosphoserine residues (ser52 and ser56) in Vpu essential for CD4
degradation. BTRCP contains 7 WD repeats at the C terminus which mediate
binding to Vpu, and an F box near the N terminus which is involved in
interaction with SKP1 (601434), a targeting factor for
ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. An F-box deletion mutant of BTRCP had a
dominant-negative effect on Vpu-mediated CD4 degradation. These data
suggest that BTRCP and SKP1 represent components of an ER-associated
protein degradation pathway that mediates CD4 proteolysis.

Activation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NFKB; see 164011) requires
phosphorylation of the NFKB inhibitor IKB-alpha (IKBA, or NFKBIA;
164008) at N-terminal serines 32 and 36 by IKB kinase-alpha (IKBKA;
600664) or IKB kinase-beta (IKBKB; 603258). Phosphorylated IKBA (pIKBA)
is then targeted for ubiquitination and destruction in the 26S
proteasome. Using affinity purification, Yaron et al. (1998) isolated a
ligase, which they denoted pIKBA-E3, from HeLa cells that binds strongly
to pIKBA and attaches ubiquitin to lysines 21 and 22. By peptide
sequencing, they identified the component of the ligase that recognizes
and ubiquitinates pIKBA as an F-box/WD40 domain from BTRC, which they
called E3RS-IKB (E3 receptor subunit for IKB). An F-box deletion mutant
of BTRC bound to but did not ubiquitinate pIKBA and acted as a
dominant-negative molecule, i.e., NFKB activation was inhibited, in
stimulated Jurkat cells in vivo.

Using SKP1 as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen and by searching DNA
databases, Cenciarelli et al. (1999) identified several genes encoding
F-box proteins, including FBW1A. Northern blot analysis detected
variable expression of 7.5-, 4.4-, and 2.5-kb FBW1A transcripts in
nearly all tissues examined. Epitope-tagged FBW1A distributed to both
the cytoplasm and nucleus of transfected HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Winston et al. (1999) determined by biochemical dissection and
expression of assembled recombinants that BTRC, and not other F-box
proteins, is the F protein in the SCF (SKP1, CUL1 (603134), and F
protein) complex. They showed that the SCF complex recognizes, in a
phosphorylation-dependent manner, a 21-amino acid destruction motif
(residues 21 to 41) in IKBA, as well as a conserved destruction motif in
beta-catenin (CTNNB1; 116806), which is also regulated by
phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination. Winston et al. (1999) noted
that CTNNB1 is a component of the WNT (see WNT1; 164820) signaling
pathway, and its levels are regulated by AXIN (603816) and GSK3B
(605004). Whole mount in situ hybridization analysis revealed that Btrc
is expressed throughout the mouse embryo at day 11.5 postcoitum, with
highest levels in brain, lung, and liver. Immunofluorescence analysis
demonstrated that BTRC is expressed largely, if not exclusively, in the
cytoplasm, where pIKBA ubiquitination is thought to occur.

Spencer et al. (1999) pointed out that BTRC is the vertebrate homolog of
the Drosophila Slimb protein. They found that BTRC ubiquitinates pIKBA
at specific lysines in the presence of ubiquitin-activating and
-conjugating enzymes (see 603890).

Maniatis (1999) reviewed the roles of BTRC and the SCF complex in the
NFKB, WNT, and hedgehog (see 600725) signaling pathways.

Cenciarelli et al. (1999) showed that in vitro translated FBW1A
interacted with SKP1 in an in vitro pull-down assay. The F box of FBW1A
was required for this interaction.

Neish et al. (2000) observed abrogation of ubiquitination of
phosphorylated CTNNB1 and IKBA, but not of other proteins, in a model
epithelial system with nonpathogenic Salmonella, suggesting that the
effect of the nonpathogenic bacteria is specific to the SCF complex
substrates CTNNB1 and IKBA.

The Drosophila circadian clock is driven by daily fluctuations of the
proteins Period (Per; 602260) and Timeless (Tim; 603887), which
associate in a complex and negatively regulate the transcription of
their own genes. Protein phosphorylation has a central role in this
feedback loop, by controlling Per stability in both cytoplasmic and
nuclear compartments, as well as Per/Tim nuclear transfer. Grima et al.
(2002) demonstrated that the product of the slimb (slmb) gene is an
essential component of the Drosophila circadian clock. slmb mutants are
behaviorally arrhythmic, and can be rescued by targeted expression of
slmb in the clock neurons. In constant darkness, highly phosphorylated
forms of the Per and Tim proteins are constitutively present in the
mutants, indicating that the control of their cyclic degradation is
impaired. Because levels of Per and Tim oscillate in slmb mutants
maintained in light:dark conditions, light- and clock-controlled
degradation of Per and Tim do not rely on the same mechanisms.

Casein kinase I-epsilon (600863) has a prominent role in regulating the
phosphorylation and abundance of Per proteins in animals. Using a
Drosophila cell culture system, Ko et al. (2002) demonstrated that
Double-time, the Drosophila homolog of CKI-epsilon, promotes the
progressive phosphorylation of Per, leading to the rapid degradation of
hyperphosphorylated isoforms by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Slimb,
an F-box/WD40-repeat protein functioning in the ubiquitin-proteasome
pathway, interacts preferentially with phosphorylated Per and stimulates
its degradation. Overexpression of slimb or expression in clock cells of
a dominant-negative version of slimb disrupts normal rhythmic activity
in flies. Ko et al. (2002) concluded that hyperphosphorylated Per is
targeted to the proteasome by interactions with Slimb.

Noubissi et al. (2006) demonstrated that beta-catenin stabilizes the
mRNA encoding the F-box protein BTRCP1 and identified the RNA-binding
protein CRDBP (608288) as a target of beta catenin/Tcf transcription
factor. CRDBP binds to the coding region of BTRCP1 mRNA. Overexpression
of CRDBP stabilized BTRCP1 mRNA and elevated BTRCP1 levels both in cells
and in vivo, resulting in the activation of the Skp1-Cullin1-F-box
protein (SCF)-BTRCP1 E3 ubiquitin ligase and in accelerated turnover of
its substrates including I-kappa-B (see 164008) and beta-catenin. CRDBP
is essential for the induction of both BTRCP1 and c-Myc (190080) by
beta-catenin signaling in colorectal cancer cells. Noubissi et al.
(2006) concluded that high levels of CRDBP that are found in primary
human colorectal tumors exhibiting active beta-catenin/Tcf signaling
implicates CRDBP induction in the upregulation of BTRCP1, in the
activation of dimeric transcription factor NF-kappa-B (see 164011), and
in the suppression of apoptosis in these cancers.

Claspin (CLSPN; 605434) is an adaptor protein required for activation of
CHK1 (CHEK1; 603078), a central component of DNA checkpoint signaling.
Mailand et al. (2006) and Peschiaroli et al. (2006) found that claspin
became degraded at the onset of mitosis. Claspin degradation was
triggered by its interaction with and ubiquitylation by BTRC. The
BTRC-claspin interaction was phosphorylation dependent and required PLK1
(602098) activity and integrity of the BTRC degradation motif in the N
terminus of claspin. Mailand et al. (2006) found that uncoupling claspin
from BTRC by mutating the conserved serines in the degradation motif or
by BTRC knockdown stabilized claspin in mitosis, impaired CHK1
dephosphorylation, and delayed G2/M transition during recovery from cell
cycle arrest imposed by DNA damage or replication stress. The inability
to degrade claspin allowed partial reactivation of CHK1 in cells exposed
to DNA damage after passing the G2/M transition. Peschiaroli et al.
(2006) found that expression of a stable claspin mutant unable to bind
BTRC prolonged activation of CHK1, thereby attenuating recovery from the
DNA replication stress response and significantly delaying entry into
mitosis.

Dorrello et al. (2006) found that the tumor suppressor programmed cell
death protein-4 (PDCD4; 608610) inhibits the translation initiation
factor EIF4A (see 602641), an RNA helicase that catalyzes the unwinding
of secondary structure at the 5-prime untranslated region of mRNAs. In
response to mitogens, PDCD4 was rapidly phosphorylated on ser67 by the
protein kinase S6K1 (608938) and subsequently degraded via the ubiquitin
ligase SCF-beta(TRCP). Expression in cultured cells of a stable PDCD4
mutant that was unable to bind beta-TRCP inhibited translation of an
mRNA with a structured 5-prime untranslated region, resulted in smaller
cell size, and slowed down cell cycle progression. Dorrello et al.
(2006) proposed that regulated degradation of PDCD4 in response to
mitogens allows efficient protein synthesis and consequently cell
growth.

Using an unbiased screen, Guardavaccaro et al. (2008) demonstrated that
REST (600571) is an interactor with the F-box protein beta-TRCP. REST is
degraded by means of the ubiquitin ligase beta-TRCP during the G2 phase
of the cell cycle to allow transcriptional derepression of Mad2
(601467), an essential component of the spindle assembly checkpoint. The
expression in cultured cells of a stable REST mutant, which is unable to
bind beta-TRCP, inhibited Mad2 expression and resulted in a phenotype
analogous to that observed in Mad2 heterozygous cells. In particular,
Guardavaccaro et al. (2008) observed defects that were consistent with
faulty activation of the spindle checkpoint, such as shortened mitosis,
premature sister-chromatid separation, chromosome bridges and
missegregation in anaphase, tetraploidy, and a faster mitotic slippage
in the presence of a spindle inhibitor. An indistinguishable phenotype
was observed by expressing the oncogenic REST-FS mutant, which does not
bind beta-TRCP. Thus, beta-TRCP-dependent degradation of REST during G2
permits the optimal activation of the spindle checkpoint, and
consequently it is required for the fidelity of mitosis.

Westbrook et al. (2008) showed that REST is regulated by
ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, and used an RNA interference screen to
identify a Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein complex containing the F-box protein
beta-TRCP as an E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for REST degradation.
Beta-TRCP binds and ubiquitinates REST and controls its stability
through a conserved phospho-degron. During neural differentiation, REST
is degraded in a beta-TRCP-dependent manner. Beta-TRCP is required for
proper neural differentiation only in the presence of REST, indicating
that beta-TRCP facilitates this process through degradation of REST.
Conversely, failure to degrade REST attenuates differentiation.
Furthermore, Westbrook et al. (2008) found that beta-TRCP
overexpression, which is common in human epithelial cancers, causes
oncogenic transformation of human mammary epithelial cells and that this
pathogenic function requires REST degradation. Thus, Westbrook et al.
(2008) concluded that REST is a key target in beta-TRCP-driven
transformation and that the beta-TRCP-REST axis is a new regulatory
pathway controlling neurogenesis.

Pierce et al. (2009) developed a quantitative framework based on product
distribution that predicted that the really interesting new gene (RING)
E3 enzymes SCF(Cdc4) (see 606278) and SCF-beta-TrCP work with the E2
Cdc34 (116948) to build polyubiquitin chains on substrates by sequential
transfers of single ubiquitins. Measurements with millisecond time
resolution directly demonstrated that substrate polyubiquitylation
proceeds sequentially. Pierce et al. (2009) concluded that their results
presented an unprecedented glimpse into the mechanism of RING ubiquitin
ligases and illuminated the quantitative parameters that underlie the
rate and pattern of ubiquitin chain assembly.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

De Mollerat et al. (2003) conducted mutation analysis of the dactylin
gene (DAC; 608071) in 7 patients with split-hand/split-foot malformation
(SHFM3; 246560) and found no point mutations. However, Southern blot,
pulsed field gel electrophoresis, and dosage analyses demonstrated a
complex rearrangement associated with a 0.5-Mb tandem duplication in all
the patients. This duplicated region contained a disrupted extra copy of
the dactylin gene and the entire LBX1 (604255), BTRC, and POLL (606343)
genes. Similar to BTRC, DAC has been shown to be an F-box/WD40-repeat
protein involved in NFKB signaling. The authors hypothesized that
dysregulation of DAC and/or BTRC expression may be responsible for the
defect in limb development seen in these patients.

Lyle et al. (2006) used FISH and quantitative PCR to narrow the SHFM3
locus to a minimal 325-kb duplication containing only the BTRC and POLL
genes. Expression analysis of 13 candidate genes within and flanking the
duplicated region showed that BTRC and SUFU (607035), present in 3
copies and 2 copies, respectively, were overexpressed in SHFM3 patients
compared to controls. Lyle et al. (2006) suggested that SHFM3 may be
caused by overexpression of BTRC and SUFU, both of which are involved in
beta-catenin signaling.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis and FISH, Fujiwara et al. (1999) mapped the
BTRC gene to chromosome 10q24-q25. Winston et al. (1999) mapped the BTRC
gene to 10q24 by FISH. They noted that this region displays genetic
abnormalities in a limited number of prostate, melanocyte, and neural
cancers.

Jin et al. (2004) reported that the BTRC gene maps to chromosome
10q24.32 and the mouse Btrc gene maps to chromosome 19C3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Guardavaccaro et al. (2003) found that loss of Btrc in mice did not
affect viability, but it induced an impairment of spermatogenesis and
reduced male fertility.

Kudo et al. (2004) found that mammary glands of female Btrc -/- mice
showed reduced branching and hypoplasia. They observed no differences
between mutant and wildtype mammary glands during pubertal ductal
elongation, pregnancy, and lactation, the times of maximal hormonal
stimulation. To further investigate the role of Btrc in mammary gland
development, Kudo et al. (2004) generated transgenic mice expressing
human BTRC targeted to mammary epithelia. Transgenic mammary glands
displayed increased lateral ductal branching and extensive arrays of
alveolus-like protuberances. The mammary epithelia of transgenic mice
proliferated more and showed increased NFKB DNA-binding activity and
higher nuclear levels of NFKB p65 (RELA; 164014). In addition, 38% of
transgenic mice developed tumors, including mammary, ovarian, and
uterine carcinomas. Targeting the BTRC gene to lymphoid organs produced
no effects in these tissues.
