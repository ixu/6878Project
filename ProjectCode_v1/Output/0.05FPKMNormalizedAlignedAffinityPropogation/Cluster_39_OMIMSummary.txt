CYTOKERATIN 18; CYK18
DESCRIPTION Intermediate filaments (IFs) are a structurally related family of
cellular proteins that appear to be intimately involved with the
cytoskeleton. The common structural motif shared by all IFs is a central
alpha-helical 'rod domain' flanked by variable N- and C-terminal
domains. The rod domain, the canonical feature of IFs, has been highly
conserved during evolution. The variable terminals, however, have
allowed the known IFs to be classified into 6 distinct types by virtue
of their differing amino acid sequences (Steinert and Roop, 1988).
Keratins compose types I and II; intermediate filaments desmin,
vimentin, GFAP, and peripherin, type III; neurofilaments, type IV, and
nuclear lamins, type V. Nestin (600915) has been classed as type VI
(Lendahl et al., 1990). The acidic keratins are coded by genes KRT9
(607606) to KRT19 (148020). These genes are located on mouse chromosome
11 and human chromosome 17, except for KRT18 which may be located on
human chromosome 12 (see later). The basic keratins are coded by genes
KRT1 (139350) to KRT8 (148060), which are located on mouse chromosome 15
and human chromosome 12.

Human keratin 18 and the homologous mouse Endo B are type I IF protein
subunits whose expression is restricted in adults to a variety of simple
epithelial tissues. Endo B and its coexpressed type II keratin, Endo A
(the mouse equivalent of human keratin 8), appear to be the first IF
proteins expressed during murine development. Type I and type II
keratins are usually expressed as preferential pairs in equal
proportions in cells, although filaments can be formed in vitro from
heterologous IF subunits. KRT18 is the most divergent of the type I
keratins with N-terminal and C-terminal domains that are quite different
from those of epidermal keratins. According to Kulesh and Oshima (1989),
the genes that code for 12 diverse IF proteins had been cloned and
characterized. Kulesh and Oshima (1989) isolated the human KRT18 gene as
a 10-kb fragment of genomic DNA. Following transfection, the gene was
expressed in several different mouse cell lines including nonepithelial
cells that do not express the homologous endogenous Endo-B gene. The
KRT18 gene is 3,791 bp long and the keratin 18 protein is coded for by 7
exons. The exon structure of KRT18 has been conserved compared to that
of other keratin genes, with the exception of a single 3-prime terminal
exon that codes for the tail domain of the protein that is represented
by 2 exons in epidermal keratins. Waseem et al. (1990) used
human-specific primers from within introns of the published gene
sequence for human type I keratin 18 and PCR to amplify this gene
specifically. By Southern blotting using the genomic DNA PCR product,
they assigned the gene for keratin 18 to chromosome 12. Other human type
I keratins have been assigned to chromosome 17. Waseem et al. (1990)
suggested that the findings indicate the early divergence of the genes
for stratifying cell keratins from that of simple, or embryonic, keratin
18.

By in situ hybridization, Heath et al. (1990) localized a human
cytokeratin 18 cDNA sequence to 17p12-p11. They presented the findings
as evidence for a clustering of cytokeratin genes and related sequences
on the p and q arms of chromosome 17. The findings are, however,
inconsistent with those of Waseem et al. (1990).

By analysis of a YAC contig from 12q13, Yoon et al. (1994) demonstrated
that the KRT18 type I keratin gene is located next to its type II
partner, KRT8, in a cluster of type II keratin genes.

Ku et al. (1995) described transgenic mice that express point-mutant K18
and develop chronic hepatitis and hepatocyte fragility in association
with disruption of hepatocyte keratin filaments. They showed that
transgenic mice expressing mutant K18 are highly susceptible to
hepatotoxicity after acute administration of acetaminophen or chronic
ingestion of griseofulvin. The authors concluded that the predisposition
to hepatotoxicity results directly from the keratin mutation since
nontransgenic or transgenic mice that express normal human K18 are more
resistant. Hepatotoxicity was manifested by a significant difference in
lethality, liver histopathology, and biochemical serum testing. Keratin
glycosylation decreased in all griseofulvin-fed mice, whereas keratin
phosphorylation increased dramatically preferentially in mice expressing
normal K18. The phosphorylation increase in normal K18 after
griseofulvin feeding appeared to involve sites that are different from
those that increased after partial hepatectomy. Ku et al. (1996) stated
that this dramatic phosphorylation increase in nonmutant keratins could
provide survival advantage to hepatocytes. Although the potential for
K18 mutations to cause human disease remain to be investigated, they
considered it possible that K8/18 mutations may not directly cause
disease but may predispose to it; for example, mutations may confer
susceptibility to liver disease upon exposure to an environmental factor
such as a virus or hepatotoxin.

Although mutations had been described in 11 of the more than 20 keratin
intermediate filaments (as the basis of epidermal and oral disorders),
no disease-associated mutations had been described in keratin 8 (KRT8;
148060) or KRT18 until the report by Ku et al. (1997). K8/18 is the
major keratin pair in epithelia of the type found in liver, pancreas,
and intestine. Transgenic mice that express mutant keratin 18, as
already noted, develop chronic hepatitis, and have an increased
susceptibility to drug-induced hepatotoxicity. By studying patients with
liver disease of unknown cause for mutations in KRT18, Ku et al. (1997)
described a his127leu (H127L) KRT mutation in a patient with cryptogenic
cirrhosis (see 215600) that was germline transmitted (148070.0001). The
mutant KRT18 isolated from the liver explant, or after expression in
bacteria, showed an altered migration on 2-dimensional gel analysis as
compared with normal human liver or bacterially expressed KRT18.
Electron microscopy of in vitro assembled mutant KRT18 and wildtype KRT8
showed an assembly defect as compared with normal KRT8/18 assembly. The
results suggested that mutations in KRT18 predispose to cryptogenic
cirrhosis in humans.

Among 120 patients with cirrhosis of undetermined cause (see 215600), Ku
et al. (1997) found 1 patient with a heterozygous A-to-T transversion in
the KRT18 gene that resulted in a his127-to-leu substitution. The
mutation was germline since sequencing of amplified genomic DNA,
isolated from a blood sample of the daughter of the patient, showed the
same H127L mutation in heterozygous form.

Ku et al. (2003) found a his127-to-leu mutation in noncryptogenic
cirrhosis and concluded that the mutation functions as a susceptibility
gene.

602942	TITLE *602942 ECOTROPIC VIRAL INTEGRATION SITE 5; EVI5
;;NEUROBLASTOMA STAGE 4S GENE; NB4S
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Roberts et al. (1998) cloned the breakpoints of a constitutional
t(1;10)(p22;q21) translocation in a child with stage 4S neuroblastoma
(256700). They identified the gene on chromosome 1 as EVI5, which they
called NB4S, and obtained a full-length NB4S cDNA by database analysis,
screening a liver cDNA library, and 5-prime RACE of adult brain total
RNA. The deduced 810-amino acid protein shares 88% identity with mouse
Evi5. A 200-amino acid region of NB4S shares significant homology with
TBC1 box motif proteins (see 609850) involved in cell growth and
differentiation. The C-terminal end of the protein contains a number of
coiled-coil domains, indicating a possible protein-protein binding
function. Northern blot analysis detected a 7.5-kb transcript in a wide
variety of tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) inhibitor EMI1 (FBXO5;
606013) controls progression to S phase and mitosis by stabilizing key
APC/C ubiquitination substrates, including cyclin A (CCNA2; 123835).
Eldridge et al. (2006) found that endogenous EVI5 and EMI1
coprecipitated from human embryonic kidney cell lysates and that the
recombinant proteins interacted in vitro. Each protein bound the other
through its N terminus. Immunofluorescence microscopy localized EVI5
predominantly to centrosomes in interphase human osteosarcoma cells, and
centrosomal localization required the C-terminal half of EVI5. In
synchronized HeLa cells, EVI5 accumulated in early G1 phase, reached
maximal level by late G1, and decreased in early mitosis concomitantly
with EMI1 in a ubiquitin- and proteasome-dependent manner. Degradation
of EVI5 in early mitosis required phosphorylation of EVI5 by PLK1
(602098). In vivo and in vitro experiments showed that EVI5 stabilized
EMI1 during interphase by binding to a site adjacent to the EMI1 degron
and blocking both PLK-dependent degron phosphorylation and subsequent
BTRC (603482) binding. By doing so, EVI5 antagonized ubiquitin-dependent
destruction of EMI1 by the BTRC-containing SCF complex. Ablation of EVI5
by small interfering RNA caused precocious degradation of EMI1,
premature APC/C activation, cyclin destruction, cell cycle arrest,
centrosome overduplication, and mitotic catastrophe. Eldridge et al.
(2006) concluded that EVI5 serves as a critical regulator of cell cycle
progression by defining a window of stability for EMI1 during interphase
analogous to the window of stability provided by EMI1 for APC/C
substrates over a similar period.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Roberts et al. (1998) mapped the EVI5 gene
to chromosome 1p22.

CYTOGENETICS

Roberts et al. (1998) cloned the breakpoints of a constitutional
t(1;10)(p22;q21) translocation in a child with stage 4S neuroblastoma.
The chromosome 1 breakpoint interrupted NB4S, and the chromosome 10
breakpoint interrupted a novel transcript, called TRNG10, that could
only be detected in tumor cells. This transcript has no exon/intron
structure or significant open reading frame, suggesting that it is a
structural RNA that is transcribed but not translated. The chromosome
rearrangement created a fusion gene product that combined the TBC1 motif
of NB4S with a polyadenylation signal from TRNG10, potentially
generating a truncated protein with oncogenic properties.

609752	TITLE *609752 NUCLEAR RECEPTOR COACTIVATOR 7; NCOA7
;;ERAP140
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By Far Western screening of a lymphoma cell cDNA library for estrogen
receptor-alpha (ESR1; 133430)-associated factors, Shao et al. (2002)
identified a novel cDNA, nuclear receptor coactivator-7. NCOA7 encodes a
942-amino acid protein, which the authors called ERAP140 (estrogen
receptor-associated protein of 140 kD). Northern blot analysis revealed
an approximately 5.5-kb transcript in all tumor lines examined,
including ESR-positive and ESR-negative breast cancer cell lines and
HeLa cells. Northern blot analysis of multiple human tissues revealed
highest expression in brain, with lower expression in mammary gland,
ovary, uterus, prostate, stomach, bladder, spinal cord, and pancreas. In
situ hybridization in mouse tissues demonstrated exclusive expression in
neurons in brain and significant expression in the cortex but not in the
medulla in kidney.

GENE FUNCTION

Using GST pull-down assays, Shao et al. (2002) found that NCOA7
demonstrated a low level of ligand-dependent constitutive binding to
ESR1, ESR2 (see 601663), THRB (190160), PPARG (601487), and RARA
(180240). Binding was further induced by the presence of ligands. NCOA7
did not bind to RXRA (180245) in the presence or absence of ligand.
NCOA7 can enhance the transcriptional activity of the nuclear receptors
with which it interacts.

Shao et al. (2002) found that NCOA7 differs from other nuclear receptor
coactivators in that it does not contain an LXXLL receptor-coactivator
interaction motif. Instead it contains a central domain between amino
acids 489 and 559 that mediates ESR1 binding. A leucine at position 523
and/or an isoleucine at position 524 appeared to be essential for the
interaction, and the binding surface appeared to be similar to that of
other coactivators.

GENE STRUCTURE

Shao et al. (2002) demonstrated that the NCOA7 gene contains 15 exons
and spans about 150 kb of genomic DNA.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Shao et al. (2002) mapped the NCOA7 gene to
chromosome 6q22.33.

608729	TITLE *608729 ANGIOTENSIN II RECEPTOR-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; AGTRAP
;;ATRAP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using the C-terminal domain of murine At2r1a (106165) as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen, Daviet et al. (1999) cloned mouse Agtrap from a kidney
cDNA library. The deduced 161-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 17.8 kD. It contains several extensive N-terminal
hydrophobic domains, as well as potential sites for phosphorylation and
N-glycosylation. Northern blot analysis detected transcripts of 1.2 and
0.8 kb in all mouse tissues examined, with relatively high levels in
kidney, testis, and heart. PCR also detected Agtrap expression in mouse
aortic tissue and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs).

By sequencing clones obtained from a fetal brain cDNA library, followed
by EST database analysis, Wang et al. (2002) cloned human AGTRAP. The
deduced 159-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 17.3
kD. AGTRAP has a 21-amino acid N-terminal transmembrane region that is
followed by a conserved cysteine, which is potentially palmitoylated.
Mouse and human AGTRAP share 74% amino acid homology. Northern blot
analysis detected a 1.2-kb transcript in almost all tissues examined,
with highest abundance in kidney, heart, pancreas, and thyroid.

GENE FUNCTION

By affinity chromatography and coimmunoprecipitation experiments, Daviet
et al. (1999) confirmed association between mouse Agtrap and At2r1a.
Agtrap interacted specifically with the C-terminal domain of At2r1a, but
not with the C-terminal domains of several other hormone receptors,
including AT2R2 (300034), CHRM3 (118494), BDKRB2 (113503), EDNRB
(131244), and ADRB2 (109690). Overexpression of Agtrap in COS-7 cells
inhibited At2r1a activation of phospholipase C (see 607120). It did not
affect Chrm3 activation.

Cui et al. (2000) determined that transfection of mouse Agtrap into
adult rat VSMCs potentiated At2r1 internalization upon angiotensin II
(see 106150) stimulation. Receptor-induced DNA synthesis was inhibited
in Agtrap-transfected VSMCs, and this was associated with inhibition of
Stat3 (102582) and Akt (see 164730) phosphorylation. Cui et al. (2000)
concluded that AGTRAP is a negative regulator of AT2R1-mediated cell
proliferation in VSMCs.

Using several assays of protein interaction, Wang et al. (2002) showed
that AGTRAP interacted with RACK1 (176981). They suggested that the
AGTRAP-RACK1 interaction may help recruit the signaling complex to AT2R1
and affect receptor signaling.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay, Guo et al. (2005) demonstrated that mouse
Caml (CAMLG; 601118) interacted with Atrap. The N-terminal hydrophilic
domain of Caml mediated the interaction, and the proteins colocalized in
the endoplasmic reticulum. Atrap knockdown increased NFAT (see NFATC2;
600490) activity, and overexpression of Atrap decreased angiotensin II-
or Caml-induced NFAT transcriptional activation. Overexpression of the
N-terminal ATRAP-interacting domain of Caml increased angiotensin
II-induced NFAT promoter activity, whereas overexpression of the
C-terminal end of Caml disrupted the effect of angiotensin II on NFAT
signaling.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the AGTRAP
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP SHGC-32094).

610396	TITLE *610396 TRAFFICKING PROTEIN PARTICLE COMPLEX, SUBUNIT 6A; TRAPPC6A
;;TRAPP COMPLEX, SUBUNIT 6A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TRAPPC6A is a subunit of the TRAPPI and TRAPPII complexes (Gwynn et al.,
2006).

CLONING

Gwynn et al. (2006) cloned mouse Trappc6a, and they identified human
TRAPPC6A by database analysis. Mouse and human TRAPPC6A encode deduced
159-amino acid proteins that share 83% identity and have calculated
molecular masses of 17.4 kD. Both proteins contain 2 motifs conserved in
TRAPPC6B (610397) and several yeast TRAPP subunits, including Trs33, the
putative homolog of TRAPPC6A and TRAPPC6B. Northern blot analysis
detected Trappc6a expression in all mouse tissues examined, with highest
expression in kidney, liver, and testis. Expression of mouse Trappc6a
was higher in cultured melanocytes than in kidney.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gwynn et al. (2006) determined that the mouse Trappc6a gene contains 6
exons.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the
TRAPPC6A gene to chromosome 19 (TMAP RH98840). Gwynn et al. (2006)
mapped the mouse Trappc6a gene to chromosome 7.

ANIMAL MODEL

Gwynn et al. (2006) identified a recessive mutation in mice, designated
'mosaic hypopigmentation' (Mhyp), that caused mosaic loss of coat
pigmentation and patchy loss of pigmentation with abnormal melanosomes
in the retinal pigmented epithelial layer of the eye. They determined
that Mhyp resulted from integration of an 8.4-kb retrovirus into intron
1 of the Trappc6a gene.

601447	TITLE *601447 UBIQUITIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE 5; USP5
;;ISOPEPTIDASE T; ISOT
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ubiquitin (see 191339)-dependent proteolysis is a complex pathway of
protein metabolism implicated in such diverse cellular functions as
maintenance of chromatin structure, receptor function, and degradation
of abnormal proteins. A late step of the process involves disassembly of
the polyubiquitin chains on degraded proteins into ubiquitin monomers.
USP5 disassembles branched polyubiquitin chains by a sequential exo
mechanism, starting at the proximal end of the chain (Wilkinson et al.,
1995).

CLONING

Wilkinson et al. (1995) purified a 93-kD bovine protein with the
properties expected of a polyubiquitin disassembly protein. They
biochemically characterized the enzyme, which they called isopeptidase T
(ISOT), and cloned a cDNA encoding the human homolog (GenBank U35116).
The deduced 835-amino acid human polypeptide has a predicted molecular
mass of 93.3 kD.

Ansari-Lari et al. (1996) generated the genomic sequence of the human
CD4 gene (186940) and its neighboring region on chromosome 12 using the
large-scale shotgun sequencing strategy. A total of 117 kb of genomic
sequence and approximately 11 kb of cDNA sequence was obtained. They
identified in this sequence 8 genes, including CD4 and ISOT. Using a
battery of strategies, the exon/intron boundaries, splice variants, and
tissue expression patterns of the genes were determined. Tissue
expression analysis indicated a high level of expression of a 3.3-kb
ISOT transcript in brain, and a low level of expression in heart, lung,
spleen, and skeletal muscle. Sequence comparison showed that ISOT is a
member of the ubiquitin C-terminal hydroxylase family. Wilkinson et al.
(1995) originally cloned human ISOT and reported the sequence as 3,102
bp long. Ansari-Lari et al. (1996) stated that comparison of their cDNA
sequence with the sequence reported by Wilkinson et al. (1995) indicated
alternative splicing in exon 15. Four nucleotide differences were found
between the 2 sequences resulting in lys-to-arg and gly-to-asp
substitutions. The cDNA and genomic sequences were in full agreement.

Reyes-Turcu et al. (2006) stated that the 835-amino acid human USP5
protein contains 4 putative ubiquitin-binding domains: an N-terminal
zinc finger ubiquitin-binding domain (ZNF-UBP), a ubiquitin-specific
processing protease (UBP) domain formed by noncontiguous regions
containing the active-site cys and his boxes, and 2 ubiquitin-associated
domains (UBA1 and UBA2). UBA1 and UBA2 are located between the cys and
his boxes, which are in the central and C-terminal regions of USP5,
respectively.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Reyes-Turcu et al. (2006) reported the crystal structures of the ZNF-UBP
domain of USP5 alone and in complex with ubiquitin at 2.09-angstrom
resolution. They found that, unlike other ubiquitin-binding domains, the
ZNF-UBP domain contains a deep binding pocket where the C-terminal
diglycine motif of ubiquitin is inserted, thus explaining the
specificity of USP5 for an unmodified C terminus on the proximal subunit
of polyubiquitin. Mutation analysis showed that the ZNF-UBP domain was
required for optimal catalytic activation of USP5.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Ansari-Lari et al. (1996) mapped the USP5

;;TRANS-2-ENOYL-CoA REDUCTASE, MITOCHONDRIAL;;
2-@ENOYL THIOESTER REDUCTASE;;
NUCLEAR RECEPTOR-BINDING FACTOR 1; NRBF1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to S. cerevisiae
trans-2-enoyl thioesterase, followed by PCR amplification, Miinalainen
et al. (2003) cloned NRBF1. The deduced 373-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 37 kD. Homologous proteins were identified
in mammalian, nematode, and yeast databases. The mammalian proteins
contain a putative N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal, and all
contain a tyrosine residue critical for catalysis in the yeast enzyme.
Northern blot analysis detected a 1.4-kb NRBF1 transcript expressed at
highest levels in skeletal and heart muscle. Expression was weaker in
brain, placenta, liver, kidney, and pancreas, and no expression was
detected in lung. SDS-PAGE showed that purified recombinant NRBF1 had an
apparent molecular mass of about 37 kD. Size exclusion chromatography
estimated a native mass of 65 kD, indicating that NRBF1 forms
homodimers.

GENE FUNCTION

Miinalainen et al. (2003) demonstrated that recombinant NRBF1 reduced
trans-2-enoyl-CoA to acyl-CoA with chain lengths from C6 to C16 in an
NADPH-dependent manner, with preference for medium chain-length
substrates. Furthermore, expression of human NRBF1 in a yeast strain
deficient in 2-enoyl thioester reductase restored mitochondrial
respiratory function and allowed growth on glycerol.

GENE STRUCTURE

Miinalainen et al. (2003) determined that the NRBF1 gene contains 10
exons and spans more than 37 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Miinalainen et al. (2003) mapped the NRBF1
gene to chromosome 1p22.3.

;;p40.5;;
PROTEASE 26S, SUBUNIT 11; S11
DESCRIPTION Ubiquitinated proteins are degraded by a 26S ATP-dependent protease. The
protease is composed of a 20S catalytic proteasome and PA700, a 700-kD
regulatory complex (see PSMC1; 602706).

Hori et al. (1998) determined the partial protein sequences of bovine
p28 (PSMD10; 603480) and p40.5, 2 components of PA700. By searching a
sequence database, they identified cDNAs encoding the human p28 and
p40.5 homologs. The predicted human p40.5 protein contains 376 amino
acids and has a molecular mass of 43 kD. Using computerized homology
searches, Hori et al. (1998) identified Nas7, an S. cerevisiae gene
encoding a protein with 31% identity to p40.5. They disrupted the Nas7
gene and found that Nas7-deficient yeast cells were sensitive to heat
stress. Northern blot analysis revealed that p40.5 was expressed as a
1.3-kb mRNA in all human tissues tested.

By sequencing peptides obtained from purified 26S proteasome subunits,
followed by database analysis and PCR of human myeloblast cell line RNA,
Hoffman et al. (1999) cloned the PSMD13 gene, which they called subunit
11 (S11). The deduced 376-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of 42.9 kD, and it shares 97% identity with mouse S11. Western blot
analysis detected S11 at about 43 kD.

By Far Western blot analysis, Hoffman et al. (1999) determined that S11
bound the 26S proteasome and the 19S regulatory complex, but not the 20S
proteasome.

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PSMD13
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP STS-T99644).

613968	TITLE *613968 TASTE RECEPTOR, TYPE 2, MEMBER 60; TAS2R60
;;T2R60
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TAS2R60 belongs to the large TAS2R receptor family. TAS2Rs are expressed
on the surface of taste receptor cells and mediate the perception of
bitterness through a G protein-coupled second messenger pathway (summary
by Conte et al., 2002). For further information on the TAS2R gene
family, see 604791.

CLONING

By screening the human genome for sequences related to TAS2Rs, Conte et
al. (2002) cloned TAS2R60, which they called T2R60. The deduced
318-amino acid protein contains the 7-transmembrane structure and short
N- and C-terminal domains conserved in TAS2Rs. The intracellular domains
share significant conservation with other TAS2R family members. TAS2R60
shares highest sequence similarity with TAS2R41 (613965).

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid and genomic sequence analyses, Conte et al.
(2002) mapped the TAS2R60 gene to an approximately 3-Mb cluster on
chromosome 7q.

Gross (2011) mapped the TAS2R60 gene to chromosome 7q35 based on an
alignment of the TAS2R60 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AY114094) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

POLYADENYLATE-BINDING PROTEIN, INDUCIBLE; IPABP;;
ACTIVATED-PLATELET PROTEIN 1; APP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

PABPs bind to the poly(A) tail present at the 3-prime ends of most
eukaryotic mRNAs. Yang et al. (1995) isolated an activation-induced
T-cell mRNA encoding a protein similar to PABPC1 (604679). The predicted
644-amino acid protein, which they designated iPABP (inducible PABP),
shares 79% sequence identity with PABPC1. Both proteins contain 4
RNA-binding domains and proline-rich C termini, and both have very
similar RNA-binding properties. Using immunofluorescence, Yang et al.
(1995) determined that iPABP localizes primarily to the cytoplasm.
Northern blot analysis revealed that iPABP was expressed as a 3.2-kb
mRNA in all tissues tested.

Houng et al. (1997) identified iPABP as an antigen, APP1
(activated-platelet protein-1), expressed on thrombin-activated rabbit
platelets. They isolated rabbit and human APP1 cDNAs. The predicted
human and rabbit proteins are 99% identical. Houng et al. (1997) noted
that activated platelets express molecules that execute many of the
complex cellular biochemical processes that stanch the loss of blood and
begin the process of vascular repair.

GENE FUNCTION

Yang et al. (1995) showed that activation of T cells increased iPABP
mRNA levels in T cells approximately 5-fold. The authors suggested that
iPABP might be necessary for regulation of stability of labile mRNA
species in activated T cells.

Houng et al. (1997) stated that, given its similarity to PABPC1, APP1
may be involved in the regulation of protein translation in platelets
and megakaryocytes or may participate in the binding or stabilization of
polyadenylates in platelet dense granules.

MAPPING

By amplification of specific DNA fragments from a human-rodent somatic
cell hybrid panel, Feral et al. (1999) mapped the PABPC4 gene to
chromosome 1; this result, compared with radiation hybrid database
information, localized the gene to 1p36-p32.

604097	TITLE *604097 UROTENSIN II; UTS2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Coulouarn et al. (1998) clearly established the existence of urotensin
II in mammals by characterizing cDNAs encoding the urotensin II
precursors not only in frog but also in human. In both species, the UTS2
sequence is located at the C-terminal position of the precursor. Human
UTS2 is composed of only 11 amino acid residues, while fish and frog
UTS2 possess 12 and 13 amino acid residues, respectively. The cyclic
region of UTS2, which is responsible for the biologic activity of the
peptide, has been fully conserved from fish to human. Northern blot and
dot blot analysis showed that UTS2 precursor mRNAs are found
predominantly in the frog and human spinal cord. In situ hybridization
studies showed that the UTS2 precursor gene is actively expressed in
motoneurons. The fact that evolutionary pressure has acted to conserve
fully the biologically active sequence of UTS2 suggests that the peptide
may exert important physiologic functions in humans.

GENE FUNCTION

Ames et al. (1999) identified a human G protein-coupled receptor, GPR14
(600896), which functions as a urotensin II receptor. Human urotensin II
binds to recombinant human GPR14 with high affinity, and the binding is
functionally coupled to calcium mobilization. Human urotensin II is
found within both vascular and cardiac tissue, including coronary
atheroma, and effectively constricts isolated arteries from nonhuman
primates. The potency of vasoconstriction of urotensin II was an order
of magnitude greater than that of endothelin-1 (131240), making human
urotensin II the most potent mammalian vasoconstrictor identified to
that time. In vivo, human urotensin II markedly increased total
peripheral resistance in anesthetized nonhuman primates, a response
associated with profound cardiac contractile dysfunction. Furthermore,
urotensin II immunoreactivity was found within the central nervous
system and endocrine tissues, suggesting that it may have additional
activities.

UTS2 has several cardiovascular actions, including potent vasoactive,
and cardiac inotropic and hypertropic properties. Douglas et al. (2002)
investigated the degree of expression of UTS2 and its receptor GPR14 in
the myocardium of patients with congestive heart failure. They obtained
specimens of myocardium from the hearts of 19 patients with end-stage
congestive heart failure, 5 patients with early-stage congestive heart
failure, and 8 healthy controls. They found strong expression of UTS2 in
the cardiomyocytes, and to a lesser extent in the vascular smooth muscle
cells, endothelial cells, and inflammatory cells of patients with
end-stage congestive heart failure. There was significantly less UTS2
expression in the myocardium of patients with early-stage congestive
heart failure, and little or no UTS2 expression in the myocardium of
healthy controls. RT-PCR showed increased concentrations of UTS2 and the
presence of urotensin receptor mRNA in the myocardium of patients with
congestive heart failure. Confocal microscopy showed a significant
increase in the binding sites for urotensin in the myocardium of
patients with end-stage congestive heart failure.

GENE FAMILY

The caudal neurosecretory system of teleost fish, which terminates in
the urophysis, exhibits morphofunctional similarities to the
hypothalamoneurohypophyseal complex (Bern et al., 1985). Two major
regulatory peptides have been isolated from urophysial extracts and
chemically characterized. Urotensin I, a 41-amino acid peptide, is
structurally similar to mammalian corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF;
122560) and to the frog skin peptide sauvagine; urotensin II (UTS2) is a
cyclic 12-amino acid peptide that has some sequence similarity, but is
not homologous, to somatostatin-14 (see 182450). The characterization of
UTS2 from the urophysis of various teleost species has shown that the
structure of the C-terminal cyclic hexapeptide has been fully conserved,
while several substitutions have occurred in the N-terminal region of
the molecule. Subsequently it was found that urotensin II-like molecules
are present in distant taxa, from mollusks to amphibians, suggesting
that urotensin-related peptides may also occur in mammals. In support of
this hypothesis, a peptide with a high degree of sequence similarity
with UTS1, called urocortin (UCN; 600945), was characterized in the rat
and human brain. In addition, specific binding sites for urotensin II
were demonstrated in rat blood vessels, and fish urotensin II was found
to exert cardiovascular effects in rat and rabbit. It was also found
that the mouse anococcygeus muscle has special sensitivity to urotensin
II (summary by Coulouarn et al., 1998).

611610	TITLE *611610 PHOSPHOGLUCOMUTASE 2-LIKE 1; PGM2L1
DESCRIPTION By database searching with the sequence of PGM2 (172000) as query,
Maliekal et al. (2007) identified PGM2L1. The deduced 622-amino acid
PGM2L1 protein has a molecular mass of 72 kD and shares 60% sequence
identity with the PGM2 protein. Sequence analysis suggested that PGM2L1
is a cytosolic protein. Quantitative RT-PCR of mouse tissues showed that
PGM2L1 was mainly expressed in brain where glucose-1,6-bisphosphate
synthase activity was previously shown to be particularly high. High
expression was also detected in testis, and intermediate expression was
found in thymus, spleen, lung, and skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

In studies with PGM2 and PGM2L1 in E. coli, Maliekal et al. (2007) found
that PGM2 acted more than 10-fold better as a phosphopentomutase (both
on deoxyribose 1-phosphate and on ribose 1-phosphate) than as a
phosphoglucomutase, while PGM2L1 was about 5- to 20-fold better in
catalyzing the 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate-dependent synthesis of glucose
1,6-bisphosphate and other aldose-bisphosphates.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PGM2L1
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP WI-15948). Scott (2007) mapped the gene to
11q13.4 based on an alignment of the PGM2L1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK
AB019210) with the genomic sequence (build 36.2).

600187	TITLE *600187 EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 5A; EIF5A
;;EIF5A1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The eukaryotic initiation factor 5A is an 18-kD protein composed of 154
amino acids. It contains a unique amino acid residue, hypusine, that is
formed posttranslationally via the transfer and hydroxylation of the
butylamino-group from the polyamine spermidine to a lys50 within the
EIF5A protein. Koettnitz et al. (1994) isolated and characterized the
human EIF5A pseudogene. Subsequently, Koettnitz et al. (1995) identified
a genomic clone encoding a functional EIF5A. The authors showed that
this sequence could successfully complement yeast carrying the HYP2
mutation (the homolog of EIF5A), whereas the pseudogenes could not.

GENE STRUCTURE

Koettnitz et al. (1995) found that the human EIF5A gene contains at
least 4 exons and spans at least 4.8 kb.

GENE FUNCTION

Saini et al. (2009) used molecular genetic and biochemical studies to
show that EIF5A promotes translation elongation. Depletion or
inactivation of EIF5A in the yeast S. cerevisiae resulted in the
accumulation of polysomes and an increase in ribosomal transit times.
Addition of recombinant EIF5A from yeast, but not a derivative lacking
hypusine, enhanced the rate of tripeptide synthesis in vitro. Moreover,
inactivation of EIF5A mimicked the effects of the EEF2 (130610)
inhibitor sordarin, indicating that EIF5A might function together with
EEF2 to promote ribosomal translocation. Because EIF5A is a structural
homolog of the bacterial protein EF-P, Saini et al. (2009) proposed that
EIF5A/EF-P is a universally conserved translation elongation factor.

To identify tumor suppressor genes in lymphoma (605027), Scuoppo et al.
(2012) screened a short hairpin RNA library targeting genes deleted in
human lymphomas and functionally confirmed those in a mouse lymphoma
model. Of the 9 tumor suppressors identified, 8 corresponded to genes
occurring in 3 physically linked 'clusters,' suggesting that the common
occurrence of large chromosomal deletions in human tumors reflects
selective pressure to attenuate multiple genes. Among the newly
identified tumor suppressors were adenosylmethionine decarboxylase-1
(AMD1; 180980) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A),
2 genes associated with hypusine, a unique amino acid produced as a
product of polyamine metabolism through a highly conserved pathway.
Through a secondary screen surveying the impact of all polyamine enzymes
on tumorigenesis, Scuoppo et al. (2012) established the
polyamine-hypusine axis as a new tumor suppressor network regulating
apoptosis. Unexpectedly, heterozygous deletions encompassing AMD1 and
eIF5A often occur together in human lymphomas, and cosuppression of both
genes promotes lymphomagenesis in mice. Thus, Scuoppo et al. (2012)
concluded that some tumor suppressor functions can be disabled through a
2-step process targeting different genes acting in the same pathway.

Translation elongation factor P (EF-P) is critical for virulence in
bacteria. EF-P is present in all bacteria and orthologous to archaeal
and eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (a/eIF5A). Ude et al. (2013)
demonstrated that EF-P is an elongation factor that enhances translation
of polyproline-containing proteins: in the absence of EF-P, ribosomes
stall at polyproline stretches, whereas the presence of EF-P alleviates
the translational stalling. Moreover, Ude et al. (2013) demonstrated the
physiologic relevance of EF-P to fine-tune the expression of the
polyproline-containing pH receptor CadC to levels necessary for an
appropriate stress response. Bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic cells
have hundreds to thousands of polyproline-containing proteins of diverse
function, suggesting that EF-P and a/elF5A are critical for copy number
adjustment of multiple pathways across all kingdoms of life.

Doerfel et al. (2013) showed that EF-P prevents the ribosome from
stalling during synthesis of proteins containing consecutive prolines,
such as PPG, PPP, or longer proline strings, in natural and engineered
model proteins. EF-P promotes peptide-bond formation and stabilizes the
peptidyl-transfer RNA in the catalytic center of the ribosome. EF-P is
posttranslationally modified by a hydroxylated beta-lysine attached to a
lysine residue. The modification enhances the catalytic proficiency of
the factor mainly by increasing its affinity to the ribosome. Doerfel et
al. (2013) proposed that EF-P and its eukaryotic homolog, elF5A, are
essential for the synthesis of a subset of proteins containing proline
stretches in all cells.

MAPPING

Steinkasserer et al. (1995) mapped the EIF5A gene to 17p13-p12 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. Three pseudogenes were mapped to
10q23.3, 17q25, and 19q13.2.

602859	TITLE *602859 PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS FACTOR 10; PEX10
;;PEROXIN 10
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Warren et al. (1998) identified the human ortholog of yeast PEX10.
Okumoto et al. (1998) isolated a human PEX10 cDNA by an expressed
sequence tag (EST) homology search of a human DNA database using yeast
Pex10 from Hansenula polymorpha, followed by screening of a human liver
cDNA library. This cDNA encodes a peroxisomal protein comprising 326
amino acids with 2 putative transmembrane segments and a C3HC4 zinc
finger RING motif. Both the N- and C-terminal regions of the PEX10
protein are exposed to the cytosol, as assessed by an expression study
of epitope-tagged PEX10 protein.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) are a group of genetically
heterogeneous, lethal diseases that are characterized by neuronal,
hepatic, and renal abnormalities and severe mental retardation; in their
most severe form, death occurs within the first year of life. Cells from
all PBD patients exhibit decreased import of one or more classes of
peroxisome matrix proteins, a phenotype shared by yeast Pex mutants.
Warren et al. (1998) observed that Pex10 expression rescued peroxisomal
matrix-protein import in PBD patients' fibroblasts from complementation
group 7 (CG7). In addition, they detected mutations on both copies of
PEX10 in 2 unrelated CG7 patients. A Zellweger syndrome (PBD6A; 614870)
patient was homozygous for a donor splice site mutation (602859.0001). A
more mildly affected neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (PBD6B; 614871)
patient was a compound heterozygote for a missense mutation and a
nonsense mutation (602859.0002).

Okumoto et al. (1998) showed that PEX10 expression morphologically and
biochemically restored peroxisome biogenesis in fibroblasts from
Zellweger patients of the complementation group called B in Japan and 7
in the U.S. One patient was found to be homozygous for an inactivating
mutation, a 2-bp deletion immediately upstream of the RING motif, which
resulted in a frameshift, altering 65 amino acids from the normal. This
implied that the C-terminal part, including the RING finger, is required
for biologic function of the PEX10 protein. PEX10 cDNA derived from the
patient with the mutation was defective in peroxisome-restoring activity
when expressed in patient fibroblasts.

Warren et al. (2000) reported phenotype-genotype correlations in
patients with PEX10-deficient peroxisome biogenesis disorder. All 4
PEX10-deficient Zellweger syndrome patients were found to have nonsense,
frameshift, or splice site mutations that removed large portions of the
PEX10 coding region. In contrast, a more mildly affected PEX10-deficient
neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy patient expressed a PEX10 allele with a
missense mutation, H290Q (602859.0002), affecting the C-terminal
zinc-binding domain of the PEX10 product. These results supported the
hypothesis that severe loss-of-function mutations in PEX genes cause
more severe clinical phenotypes, whereas mildly affected PBD patients
have PEX gene mutations that retain residual function.

To quantitate the effects of PEX10 mutations, Warren et al. (2000) used
a functional complementation assay. They observed that nonsense and
frameshift mutations predicted to delete the C-terminal two-thirds
(R125X; 602859.0003) or one-third (704insA) of the protein displayed
nearly normal PEX10 activity. They also found that the unexpectedly high
PEX10 activity displayed by these cDNAs could be eliminated by removing
or mutating segments of the PEX10 cDNA downstream of the mutations.
Although these results demonstrated serious flaws in the PEX10
functional complementation assay, they suggested that the C-terminal
zinc-binding domain is critical for PEX10 function.

ANIMAL MODEL

Chen et al. (2010) reported that Drosophila pex mutants, including Pex2
(170993), Pex10, and Pex12 (601758), faithfully recapitulated several
key features of human PBD, including impaired peroxisomal protein
import, elevated very long chain fatty acid (VLCFA) levels, and growth
retardation. Moreover, disruption of pex function resulted in
spermatogenesis defects, including spermatocyte cytokinesis failure in
Drosophila. Increased VLCFA levels enhanced these spermatogenesis
defects whereas reduced VLCFA levels alleviated them. Chen et al. (2010)
concluded that regulation of proper VLCFA levels by pex genes is crucial
for spermatogenesis.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 6A (ZELLWEGER)
PEX10, IVS, G-A, +1

In a patient with Zellweger syndrome of complementation group 7 (PBD6A;
614870), Warren et al. (1998) found homozygosity for a splice donor-site
mutation in the PEX10 gene that resulted in exon skipping and loss of
407 bp from the PEX10 open reading frame. The change was a G-to-A
transition in the first position of the splice-donor site in an intron
that lies downstream from a 407-bp exon. This mutation corresponded to a
C-to-T transition at a CpG dinucleotide on the antisense strand. The
homozygous nature of this allele, which destroyed an SnaBI site, was
confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion of an amplified genomic DNA
fragment spanning the mutation. The PEX10-deficient cells of this
patient contained many peroxisomes and imported peroxisomal membrane
proteins but did not import peroxisomal matrix proteins, indicating that
the loss of PEX10 has its most pronounced effect on peroxisomal matrix
protein import.

.0002
PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 6B
PEX10, HIS290GLN

In a mildly affected neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (see PBD6B, 614871)
patient, Warren et al. (1998) found compound heterozygosity for a
missense mutation in the PEX10 zinc-binding domain, his290 to gln, and
for a nonsense mutation, arg125 to stop (602859.0003). The 2 alleles
encoded partially functional PEX10 proteins.

.0003
PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 6B
PEX10, ARG125TER

See 602859.0002 and Warren et al. (1998).

.0004
PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 6A (ZELLWEGER)
PEX10, 2-BP DEL, 814CT

In cells from a patient with Zellweger syndrome of complementation group
7 (PBD6A; 614870), Okumoto et al. (1998) found homozygosity for an
inactivating mutation, a 2-bp deletion at nucleotides 814 and 815 (CT).

The only diagnostic center for PBDs in Japan identified a total of 31
Japanese patients with PBD during the 20 years previous to the report of
Shimozawa et al. (2003). There were 27 patients with Zellweger syndrome,
including 2 sibs, 3 with neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD; see
601539), and 1 with rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata (RCDP; see
215100). No patient with infantile Refsum disease (IRD; see 601539) had
been detected. All 11 patients with Zellweger syndrome of
complementation group B had the same mutation, the homozygous 2-bp
deletion in PEX10: 814-815delCT. Analysis of single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) within PEX10 showed that the mutation probably
arose once on an ancestral chromosome in the Japanese population.

.0005
PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 6A (ZELLWEGER)
PEX10, 1 BP-INS, 704A

In a patient with Zellweger syndrome (PBD6A; 614870), their patient
PBD117, Warren et al. (2000) found compound heterozygosity for an A
insertion following nucleotide 704 in exon 4 of the PEX10 cDNA and a
deletion/insertion/frameshift mutation (602859.0006) in exon 1 of the
genome DNA, resulting in loss of nucleotides 13 to 28 of the open
reading frame and replacement of these 16 basepairs by a 20-bp
insertion. The product of the second allele contained the first 4 amino
acids of PEX10 followed by an additional 46 residues and a termination
codon; there was no evidence of PEX10 mRNA expression from the second
allele.
