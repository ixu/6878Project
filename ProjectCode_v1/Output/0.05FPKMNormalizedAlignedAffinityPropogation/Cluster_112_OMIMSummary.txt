606160	TITLE *606160 PANTOTHENATE KINASE 1; PANK1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Pantothenate kinase (EC 2.7.2.33) is an essential regulatory enzyme in
CoA biosynthesis, catalyzing the cytosolic phosphorylation of
pantothenate (vitamin B5), N-pantothenoylcysteine, and pantetheine. CoA
is the major acyl carrier, playing a central role in intermediary and
fatty acid metabolism. In both yeast and fly, each with only 1
pantothenate kinase gene, the null mutant is inviable (summary by Zhou
et al., 2001).

CLONING

Karim et al. (2000) cloned and sequenced 3 human cDNAs that encode the
alpha, beta, and gamma isoforms of PANK1, which have distinct amino
termini and are predicted to arise from alternative splicing of
transcripts of the same gene. The alpha, beta, and gamma proteins
contain 598, 373, and 400 amino acids, respectively, and share a common
C terminus of 40 kD. Northern blot analysis detected expression of PANK1
in all tissues examined, but predominantly in liver and kidney.

GENE STRUCTURE

Karim et al. (2000) determined that the PANK1 gene contains 9 exons and
spans about 62 kb.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Karim et al. (2000) mapped the
PANK1 gene to chromosome 10q23.2-q23.31. They mapped the mouse Pank1
gene to a region of syntenic homology on chromosome 19C2-3.

614657	TITLE *614657 ANGIOMOTIN-LIKE 1; AMOTL1
;;JUNCTION-ENRICHED AND -ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; JEAP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to angiomotin (AMOT;
300410), Bratt et al. (2002) identified AMOTL1 and AMOTL2 (614658). The
deduced 956-amino acid AMOTL1 protein contains a conserved N-terminal
glutamine-rich domain, followed by 2 coiled-coil domains and a
C-terminal PDZ-binding motif. AMOTL1 and AMOTL2 lack the angiostatin
(173350)-binding domain found in angiomotin. Northern blot analysis of
mouse tissues detected an approximately 8.3-kb Amotl1 transcript that
was highly expressed in brain, heart, lung, skeletal muscle, kidney, and
uterus, with much lower expression in most other tissues.

Nishimura et al. (2002) cloned mouse Amotl1, which they called Jeap. The
deduced 882-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 98.4
kD. Jeap has an N-terminal polyglutamic acid repeat, followed by a
central coiled-coil domain and a C-terminal PDZ-binding motif.
Fluorescence-tagged Jeap colocalized with Zo1 (TJP1; 601009) at tight
junctions along the apical regions of lateral membranes of transfected
canine kidney cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of mouse tissues
detected Jeap expression in exocrine glands, including pancreas,
submandibular gland, lacrimal gland, parotid gland, and sublingual
gland, but not in brain, heart, liver, kidney, spleen, gall bladder, or
duodenum. In exocrine glands, Jeap localized to the terminal portion of
serous glands. It did not localize to any endothelial cells. Western
blot analysis detected Jeap at an apparent molecular mass of about 105
kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Li et al. (2012) found that overexpression of AMOT, AMOTL1, or AMOTL2 in
HEK293T cells repressed WNT1 (164820)-dependent activation of a reporter
gene. Conversely, knockdown of all 3 genes simultaneously via small
hairpin RNA significantly increased WNT1 reporter gene activity.
However, knockdown of AMOT, AMOTL1, or AMOTL2 individually had little
effect, suggesting that they have overlapping functions in repressing
WNT activity.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the AMOTL1 gene to chromosome 11q21 based on an
alignment of the AMOTL1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF453742) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

EVOLUTION

Phylogenetic analysis by Bratt et al. (2002) suggested that angiomotin,
AMOTL1, and AMOTL2 form separate clades and that these clades arose from
a duplication of a common ancestral sequence.
