;;SYNBINDIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Ethell et al. (2000) cloned mouse Trappc4, which they called synbindin.
The deduced 219-amino acid protein contains segments of homology with
proteins involved in vesicular transport or synaptic function, including
a nonclassical PDZ domain, followed by a TRAPPC1 (610969)-like domain,
and a C-terminal tail similar to a short cytoplasmic segment of RYR2
(180902). By database analysis, Ethell et al. (2000) identified human
synbindin, which also encodes a 219-amino acid protein. Northern blot
analysis of several mouse tissues detected highest expression in liver
and skeletal muscle, followed by kidney, heart, and brain. RT-PCR, in
situ hybridization, and immunohistochemical analysis detected strong
synbindin expression in differentiated neurons. In adult mouse CNS,
expression was highest in large neurons such as pyramidal neurons,
Purkinje cells, and motor neurons and weak or undetectable in smaller
granule-type neurons. Immunogold electron microscopy of adult mouse
cerebral cortex detected synbindin predominantly in postsynaptic
membranes and postsynaptic densities, intracellular vesicles in the
dendritic shaft, membrane cisternae, and in the Golgi apparatus.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid experiments, coimmunoprecipitation assays, and in
vitro pull-down assays, Ethell et al. (2000) demonstrated that mouse
synbindin interacted directly with rat syndecan-2 (SDC2; 142460). Yeast
2-hybrid analysis also showed that synbindin interacted with rat
syndecan-4 (SDC4; 600017). Mutation analysis showed that the interaction
required the PDZ-like domain of synbindin and the EFYA motif in the
C-terminal domain of Sdc2. Primary rat hippocampal neurons transfected
with synbindin and Sdc2 expressed the proteins in clusters along
dendritic spines. Sdc2 lacking the EFYA motif formed clusters that
lacked synbindin, suggesting synbindin clustering was dependent on Sdc2.
Ethell et al. (2000) concluded that synbindin has a role in postsynaptic
membrane trafficking.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the TRAPPC4
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP WI-20793).
