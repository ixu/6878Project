DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By EST database searching for sequences with similarity to GTF2A1
(600520), followed by 5-prime RACE, Upadhyaya et al. (1999) obtained a
cDNA, which they called SALF, that encodes a protein with homology to
the Drosophila protein stoned B and to clathrin adaptor proteins (see
603535), as well as to GTF2A1. The deduced 1,182-amino acid protein has
a molecular mass of 132 kD and contains an N-terminal region (between
residues 44 and 150) rich in proline, serine, and threonine that is
related to a family of proteins involved in membrane trafficking.
Northern blot analysis with a probe for the 5-prime end of SALF revealed
expression of a 6.5-kb transcript, with highest expression in heart,
placenta, kidney, prostate, and uterus and lower expression in other
tissues. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that SALF is expressed as a 170-kD
protein.

By 5-prime and 3-prime RACE of a heart cDNA library using primers
corresponding to SALF, Martina et al. (2001) cloned stonin-1, or STN1.
The deduced 735-amino acid STN1 protein includes the N-terminal 711
amino acids of the 1,182-amino acid SALF protein and has a calculated
molecular mass of about 83 kD. STN1 contains an N-terminal proline-rich
domain, followed by a stonin homology domain and a C-terminal domain
homologous to the signal-binding domain of mu subunits of AP complexes
(see AP2M1; 601024). Northern blot analysis detected a 6.5-kb STN1
transcript in most tissues examined. Western blot analysis determined
that endogenous HeLa cell STN1 has an apparent molecular mass of 81 kD.
STN1 was recovered primarily in the cytosolic fraction of HeLa cell
lysates, with a small amount associated with membranes. It could be
partially extracted under high salt or basic conditions, indicating that
STN1 is likely a peripheral membrane protein.

Han et al. (2001) determined that SALF is a chimeric transcript that
contains exons 1 through 3 of STON1 spliced onto exons 2 through 9 of
ALF (605358). They detected no rodent counterpart of SALF by Northern
blot analysis or PCR.

GENE STRUCTURE

Han et al. (2001) determined that the STON1 gene contains 4 exons, the
first of which is noncoding.

MAPPING

By PCR of a panel of human-rodent chromosomal hybrids and genomic
sequence analysis, Han et al. (2001) mapped the STON1 gene to chromosome
2p.

;;UBA6-SPECIFIC E2; USE1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Modification of proteins with ubiquitin (UBB; 191339) or ubiquitin-like
proteins controls many signaling networks and requires a ubiquitin
activating enzyme (E1), a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (E2), and a
ubiquitin protein ligase (E3). UBE2Z is an E2 enzyme (Jin et al., 2007).

CLONING

Jin et al. (2007) stated that the deduced 354-amino acid UBE2Z protein
has a calculated molecular mass of about 38 kD. Database analysis
revealed wide expression of the UBE2Z in human tissues and cell lines.

GENE FUNCTION

Jin et al. (2007) showed that UBE2Z was specifically charged with
ubiquitin by UBA6 (UBE1L2; 611361), but not by UBE1 (314370).

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the UBE2Z
gene to chromosome 17 (TMAP RH17824).

602895	TITLE *602895 SCAFFOLD ATTACHMENT FACTOR B; SAFB
;;SAFB1;;
HSP27 ESTROGEN RESPONSE ELEMENT- AND TATA BOX-BINDING PROTEIN; HET
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Eukaryotic chromatin is organized in a higher order structure consisting
of thousands of discrete, topologically constrained loop domains. These
loops are fixed at their bases to a network composed of proteins and RNA
that is generally referred to as the nuclear matrix or scaffold.
Evidence suggests that a tight binding of chromatin to the nuclear
scaffold is not only important for the compaction of the chromatin
fiber, but is also involved in many aspects of nucleic acid metabolism.
Attachment of chromatin to the nuclear scaffold appears to occur via
specialized DNA elements called scaffold attachment regions (SARs).
Romig et al. (1992) identified 4 nuclear proteins, termed scaffold
attachment factors (SAFs) A (602869), B, C, and D, that specifically
interact with SAR DNA elements. Renz and Fackelmayer (1996) purified the
SAFB protein from HeLa cell nuclear extracts. SAFB is a monomer with a
molecular mass of 150 kD by SDS-PAGE. It is a DNA-binding protein that
has a high specificity for SAR DNA elements. Biochemical fractionation
studies demonstrated that SAFB is a component of chromatin but not of
the nuclear matrix. By screening a human HeLa cell cDNA expression
library with antibodies against purified SAFB, Renz and Fackelmayer
(1996) isolated partial cDNAs encoding SAFB. Northern blot analysis
detected a 3.4-kb SAFB transcript in all human tissues examined.

Heat-shock protein-27 (HSP27; 602195) is an estrogen-regulated protein
that enhances the proliferation and drug resistance of breast cancer.
Its promoter region contains an imperfect estrogen response element and
a TATA box. Oesterreich et al. (1997) identified HET as an HSP27
promoter-binding protein in gel retardation assays. They cloned a
partial HET cDNA by screening a human breast cancer cell (MCF-7) cDNA
expression library with the promoter region of HSP27. Using this partial
cDNA to screen a second MCF-7 cDNA library, the authors isolated a
full-length HET cDNA. Oesterreich et al. (1997) noted that the HET gene
is probably identical to the SAFB gene studied by Renz and Fackelmayer
(1996). The predicted 915-amino acid HET protein (GenBank GENBANK
2828537) is highly charged, with 221 negatively charged and 164
positively charged residues, and contains several potential
phosphorylation, glycosylation, and myristylation sites. By SDS-PAGE and
Southwestern blot analysis of MCF-7 extracts, HET had a molecular mass
of 120 kD, which is higher than its calculated mass of 100 kD.
Oesterreich et al. (1997) showed that the HET protein localizes to the
nuclear matrix of various breast cancer cell lines, a result that
disagrees with the localization studies of Renz and Fackelmayer (1996).

GENE FUNCTION

Oesterreich et al. (1997) found that overexpression of HET decreased the
activity of the HSP27 promoter in various breast cancer cell lines.

Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-on-chip and gene expression
array analyses of MCF7 human breast cancer cells, Hammerich-Hille et al.
(2010) identified 541 SAFB1- and/or SAFB2 (608066)-binding sites in
promoters of known genes. Enrichment of binding sites was observed in
regions of chromosomes 1 and 6 containing histone gene clusters. Gene
expression array analysis revealed upregulation of most target genes
following knockdown of SAFB1 or SAFB2 via small interfering RNA. In
general, SAFB2 regulated fewer genes than SAFB1, and there was
relatively little overlap in the genes regulated by SAFB1 and SAFB2. Of
all the genes regulated by SAFB1, 38% were involved in immune
regulation, 28% were involved in cell signaling, and 11% were involved
in apoptosis. SAFB1 knockdown resulted in about 11-fold increased
expression of C8ORF4 (607702) and GABBR1 (603540).

MAPPING

Using somatic cell hybrid analysis and fluorescence in situ
hybridization, DuPont et al. (1997) mapped the SAFB gene to
19p13.3-p13.2.

;;PEROXIN 6;;
PEROXISOMAL ASSEMBLY FACTOR 2; PAF2;;
PEROXISOMAL-TYPE ATPase 1; PXAAA1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Peroxisomal targeting signals (PTSs) are discrete amino acid sequences
capable of directing proteins to the peroxisome. Most peroxisomal matrix
proteins contain PTS1, a C-terminal tripeptide of the sequence
ser-lys-leu (SKL) or a conservative variant. In contrast, the N-terminal
PTS2 consists of approximately 10 amino acids
(arg/lys-leu-X5-gln/his-leu) and has been observed in only 3 peroxisomal
proteins. The only documented human PTS2-containing proteins are
peroxisomal thiolase (604054) and phytanic acid oxidase (266500).
Yahraus et al. (1996) stated that the only known human PTS2-containing
protein is thiolase. The most extensively studied of the factors
involved in peroxisomal protein import is the PTS1 receptor, encoded by
the peroxin-5 gene (PEX5; 600414) and defective in Zellweger syndrome.
Human PEX5 was originally identified by homology probing the human EST
database with the S. cerevisiae PAS8 protein sequence. The continued
application of this approach by Yahraus et al. (1996) led to the cloning
and characterization of a novel human gene (called PXAAA1 by them) based
on its similarity to PpPAS5, a gene required for peroxisome assembly in
the yeast Pichia pastoris. The 980-amino acid protein product belongs to
the AAA family of ATPases and appears to be a predominantly cytoplasmic
protein. Yahraus et al. (1996) found that substitution of an arginine
for the conserved lysine residue in the ATPase domain of the PXAAA1
protein abolished its biologic activity, suggesting that it is an
ATPase. Furthermore, they showed that the protein is required for
stability of the predominantly cytoplasmic PTS1 receptor. Yahraus et al.
(1996) concluded that the PXAAA1 protein plays a direct role in
peroxisomal protein import and is required for PTS1 receptor activity.

Distel et al. (1996) listed the peroxisomal assembly factor isolated in
the rat by Tsukamoto et al. (1995) as identical to PXAAA1 (or PEX6).
Tsukamoto et al. (1995) isolated rat peroxisome assembly factor-2 (PAF2)
cDNA by functional complementation of the peroxisome deficiency of a
mutant Chinese hamster ovary cell line, ZP92, using a transient
transfection assay. This cDNA encodes a 978-amino acid protein with 2
putative ATP-binding sites. The investigators stated that PAF2 is a
member of a putative ATPase family which includes 2 yeast gene products
essential for peroxisome assembly. The stable transformant of ZP92 with
the cDNA was morphologically and biochemically restored for peroxisome
biogenesis. Fibroblasts derived from patients deficient in peroxisome
biogenesis (complementation group C) were also complemented with rat
PAF2 cDNA, indicating that PAF2 is a strong candidate for the site of
the mutation in one peroxisomal complementation group. The proteins of
the ATPase family (AAA proteins) participate in a broad range of
cellular processes, as indicated by the designation AAA which comes from
'ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities.'

Fukuda et al. (1996) found that the 2,940-bp open reading frame of the
human PAF2 cDNA encodes a 980-amino acid protein that shows 87.1%
identity with rat PAF2.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhang et al. (1999) determined that the PEX6 gene consists of 17 exons
and 16 introns, spanning about 14 kb. The largest exon, exon 1, has at
least 952 nucleotides.

MAPPING

To determine the chromosomal localization of PXAAA1, Yahraus et al.
(1996) probed a panel of mouse/human hybrid cell lines with the
full-length PXAAA1 cDNA. Hybridizing fragments specific for human
genomic DNA were detected only in the cell lines containing human
chromosome 6. The human cDNA was also used to determine the map position
of the mouse ortholog by RFLP analysis of an interspecific backcross DNA
panel. The mouse gene mapped to chromosome 17 between markers that show
homology of synteny to human 6p22-p11.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Fukuda et al. (1996) mapped the
human PEX6 gene to 6p21.1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Yahraus et al. (1996) observed that expression of PXAAA1 restored
peroxisomal protein import in fibroblasts from 16 unrelated members of
complementation group 4 of the peroxisomal biogenesis disorders (PBDs).
Consistent with this observation, a complementation group 4 patient was
found to carry mutations in PXAAA1 (601498.0001 and 601498.0002).

Fukuda et al. (1996) found that human PAF2 restores peroxisome assembly
after gene transfer to fibroblasts of group C patients. In 2 patients
with what they termed group C Zellweger syndrome (group 4 in the
Kennedy-Krieger Institute Classification), the authors demonstrated
homozygosity for 2 different mutations in the PAF2 gene. Direct
sequencing of the PAF2 gene revealed a homozygous 1-bp insertion at
nucleotide 510 in 1 patient (601498.0003) and a splice site mutation in
intron 3 resulting in skipping of exon 3 in a second patient
(601498.0004).

Zhang et al. (1999) clarified the genomic DNA structure of PEX6 and
identified mutations in patients from various ethnic groups. Eleven
novel mutations (18 alleles) were identified by direct sequencing of the
PEX6 cDNA from 10 patients. There was no common mutation, but an exon
skip was identified in 2 unrelated Japanese patients. Most of the
mutations led to premature termination or large deletions of the PEX6
protein and resulted in the most severe peroxisome biogenesis disorder
phenotype of Zellweger syndrome. A patient with an atypical Zellweger
syndrome had a missense mutation that was shown to disrupt the cell's
ability to form peroxisomes.

Matsumoto et al. (2001) provided several lines of evidence indicating
that PEX6, the pathogenic gene for PBD of complementation group 4, is
impaired also in complementation group 6 PBD. They found that expression
of PEX6 restored peroxisome assembly in fibroblasts from a PBD patient
who was a compound heterozygote for PEX6 gene alleles.

Najmabadi et al. (2011) performed homozygosity mapping followed by exon
enrichment and next-generation sequencing in 136 consanguineous families
(over 90% Iranian and less than 10% Turkish or Arabic) segregating
syndromic or nonsyndromic forms of autosomal recessive intellectual
disability. In family M331, they identified a homozygous missense
mutation in the PEX6 gene (601498.0009) in 5 sibs with moderate
intellectual disability, retinitis pigmentosa, hearing loss, and ataxia.
Their parents, who were second cousins, had 6 healthy children.

NOMENCLATURE

Distel et al. (1996) provided a unified nomenclature for peroxisome
biogenesis. By the use of genetic approaches in a wide variety of
experimental organisms, 13 proteins required for peroxisome biogenesis
had been identified in the previous 10 years. Three of these had been
shown to be defective in lethal peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs).
However, the diversity of experimental systems had led to a profusion of
names for peroxisome assembly genes and proteins and a great array of
numbering systems. Distel et al. (1996) suggested that proteins involved
in peroxisome biogenesis should be designated 'peroxins,' with PEX
representing the gene acronym. Even though defects in peroxisomal
metabolic enzymes or transcription factors may affect peroxisome
proliferation and/or morphology, such proteins should not, they
recommended, be included in this group. The proteins and genes were to
be numbered by date of published characterization, both for known
factors and those identified in the future. When necessary, species of
origin could be specified by 1-letter abbreviations for genus and
species (e.g., hsPEX2). To minimize ambiguities in naming additional
proteins identified in the future, Distel et al. (1996) urged authors
before publication to contact the ad hoc nomenclature committee.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 4A (ZELLWEGER)
PEX6, IVSAS, G-A, -1, 8-BP DEL

After demonstrating that a newly isolated gene they called PXAAA1
corrected the defect in complementation group 4 PBD, Yahraus et al.
(1996) used a gene-specific primer to synthesize PXAAA1 cDNA from normal
and group 4 (CG4; PBD4A, 614862) fibroblasts. Fragments of the open
reading frame were then amplified by PCR and subjected to SSCP analysis.
PXAAA1 SSCP migration variants were detected in 9 of 13 CG4 patients
examined, even though only 40% of the ORF had been examined. Direct
sequencing of RT-PCR-generated cDNA fragments revealed that one patient
was a compound heterozygote for 2 different deletions: an 8-bp deletion
(nucleotides 1962-1969), and a 20-bp deletion (nucleotides 2398-2417)
together with insertion of a single T (601498.0002). Direct sequencing
of amplified genomic DNA revealed that 1 allele contained a G-to-A
transition at the -1 position of a splice acceptor site. This resulted
in the use of a cryptic splice acceptor site 8 bp downstream of the
normal site, generating the 8-bp deletion observed in the cDNA. The
father was heterozygous for this splice site mutation. The mother was
found to be heterozygous for the 20-bp deletion/1-bp insertion found in
the other allele of the patient. Both mutations in this patient (whose
cell line had the designation PBD106) shifted the reading frame of the
PXAAA1 mRNA. The product of the first allele lacked the C-terminal 326
amino acids of the protein product and instead contained the 3 amino
acids trp-leu-asp (WLD) in their place. The product of the second allele
lacked the C-terminal 181 amino acids and instead contained 15 novel
amino acids. Previous studies cited by Yahraus et al. (1996)
demonstrated that mutations which affect the reading frame of an mRNA
commonly result in mRNA instability and decreased steady-state levels of
mRNA.

In a cell line from a patient with typical clinical features of
Zellweger syndrome (PBD4A; 614862) and ghost peroxisomes (GM04340 in the
Coriell Cell Repositories), Fukuda et al. (1996) identified homozygosity
for a 1-bp insertion at nucleotide 511 which introduced a premature
termination codon in the PXAAA1 gene. The patient was the product of a
father-daughter mating.

.0004
PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 4A (ZELLWEGER)
PEX6, IVS3DS, G-A, +1

In a Japanese girl with Zellweger syndrome, complementation group C
(PBD4A; 614862), born of nonconsanguineous parents Fukuda et al. (1996)
identified a heterozygous mutation in the consensus 5-prime splice site
of intron 3 (IVS3+1G-to-A), which led to skipping of exon 3. The patient
at birth was small and had severe asphyxia, profound hypotonia, and
clonic convulsions. The patient died of respiratory failure at age 7
months. An insertion introducing frameshift in the transcript from the
other allele was also detected.

.0005
PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 4A (ZELLWEGER)
PEX6, IVS7, G-A, +1

In 2 unrelated Japanese patients with severe Zellweger syndrome of
complementation group C (PBD4A; 614862), Zhang et al. (1999) found
homozygosity for a G-to-A transition in the first position of intron 7
of the PEX6 gene. Two abnormal splicing patterns were caused by this
mutation: one a skipping of exon 7, and the other a skipping of exons 6
and 7.

.0006
PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 4A (ZELLWEGER)
PEX6, 1-BP DEL, 1301C

In a case of severe Zellweger syndrome (PBD4A; 614862) surviving to the
age of 8.5 months, Zhang et al. (1999) found homozygosity for a 1-bp
deletion, 1301delC. This deletion resulted in a frameshift at serine
codon 434 and the creation of a premature termination at codon 449.

.0007
PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 4B
PEX6, 264-BP DEL, NT619

In a patient with a diagnosis of neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD)
belonging to complementation group 6 of the peroxisome biogenesis
disorders (PBD4B, 614863), Matsumoto et al. (2001) found compound
heterozygosity for mutations in the PEX6 gene. One allele had a deletion
of nucleotides 619-882 of PEX6; the other allele had a deletion of
nucleotides 2095-2362 and an insertion of 21 nucleotides (601498.0008).

Chr6:43044093 (NCBI36), resulting in a leu534-to-pro (L534P)
substitution, in 5 sibs with moderate intellectual disability, retinitis
pigmentosa, hearing loss, and ataxia. Their parents, who were second
cousins, had 6 healthy children.

601061	TITLE *601061 SMALL NUCLEAR RIBONUCLEOPROTEIN POLYPEPTIDE D2; SNRPD2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The Sm proteins are components of the U1, U2, U4/U6 and U5 small
ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs). As many as 10 or more proteins may be
assembled into these complexes. Some of the Sm proteins are shared
between snRNPs while others are specific to particular snRNPs. Among the
core ribonucleoproteins are 3 distinct subunits designated D1 (601063),
D2, and D3 (601062). They were originally thought to be a single
species. The D proteins with the B subunit (182282) are the primary
autoantigens for the anti-Sm antibodies produced by patients with lupus
erythematosus (Lehmeier et al., 1994). Subunit D1 was cloned by Rokeach
et al. (1988). Lehmeier et al. (1994) obtained partial amino acid
sequence for the D2 and D3 proteins. Degenerate oligomers were designed
and used to isolate D2 cDNAs from a HeLa cell library. The sequence of
the D2 cDNA predicts a 118-amino acid protein with less than 15%
identity to D1 or D3. Recombinantly expressed protein could be
precipitated with anti-Sm antibodies.

601143	TITLE *601143 DYNACTIN 1; DCTN1
;;p150(GLUED), DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cytoplasmic dynein is a microtubule-based biologic motor protein.
Holzbaur and Tokito (1996) noted that dyneins were initially discovered
as enzymes that couple ATP hydrolysis to provide a force for cellular
motility in eukaryotic cilia and flagella. A distinct cytoplasmic form
of dynein (600112) was subsequently characterized and thought to be
responsible for the intracellular retrograde motility of vesicles and
organelles along microtubules (Holzbaur and Vallee, 1994). A large
macromolecular complex, dynactin, is required for the cytoplasmic
dynein-driven movement of organelles along microtubules. Dynactin is
composed of 10 distinct polypeptides of 150, 135, 62, 50 (DCTN2;
607376), 45, 42, 37, 32, 27, and 24 kD, with a combined mass of 10
million daltons. The largest polypeptide of the dynactin complex,
p150(Glued), binds directly to microtubules and to cytoplasmic dynein.
The binding of dynactin to dynein is critical for neuronal function, as
antibodies that specifically disrupt this binding block vesicle motility
along microtubules in extruded squid axoplasm. Holzbaur and Tokito
(1996) stated that the dynein-dynactin interaction is probably a key
component of the mechanism of axonal transport of vesicles and
organelles. Further evidence for a critical role for dynactin in vivo
comes from the analysis of mutations in the homologous gene in
Drosophila. Mutant alleles of the 'glued' gene induced disruption of the
neurons of the optic lobe and compound eye in heterozygotes; null
mutations are lethal.

CLONING

Holzbaur and Tokito (1996) isolated and characterized cDNA clones
encoding human p150(Glued), as well as alternatively spliced isoforms.
Using these to isolate genomic clones, they found by genomic Southern
blots that there is a single gene in the human, as had previously been
observed in rat and chick.

Jang et al. (1997) cloned and characterized mouse Dctn1. The mouse
protein shares 95% amino acid identity with the human protein. The
authors found no abnormalities of the gene in mnd2 mice.

GENE FUNCTION

Eaton et al. (2002) disrupted the dynactin complex in Drosophila, using
3 separate perturbations: dsRNA interference with arp1 (homolog of
ACTR1A; 605143), mutation in p150/Glued, and a dominant-negative Glued
transgene. In all 3 cases, the disruption resulted in an increase in the
frequency and extent of synaptic retraction events at the neuromuscular
junction. Eaton et al. (2002) concluded that dynactin functions locally
within the presynaptic arbor to promote synapse stability at the
neuromuscular junction.

Kim et al. (2004) showed that BBS4 (600374) protein localizes to the
centriolar satellites of centrosomes and basal bodies of primary cilia,
where it functions as an adaptor of the p150(glued) subunit of the
dynein transport machinery to recruit pericentriolar material-1 protein
(PCM1; 600299) and its associated cargo to the satellites. Silencing of
BBS4 induces PCM1 mislocalization and concomitant deanchoring of
centrosomal microtubules, arrest in cell division, and apoptotic cell
death.

Gauthier et al. (2004) showed that huntingtin (613004) specifically
enhances vesicular transport of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF;
113505) along microtubules. They determined that huntingtin-mediated
transport involves huntingtin-associated protein-1 (HAP1; 600947) and
the p150(Glued) subunit of dynactin, an essential component of molecular
motors. BDNF transport was attenuated both in the disease context and by
reducing the levels of wildtype huntingtin. The alteration of the
huntingtin/HAP1/p150(Glued) complex correlated with reduced association
of motor proteins with microtubules. The
polyglutamine-huntingtin-induced transport deficit resulted in the loss
of neurotrophic support and neuronal toxicity. Gauthier et al. (2004)
concluded that a key role of huntingtin is to promote BDNF transport and
suggested that loss of this function might contribute to pathogenesis.

Using in vivo skin-specific lentiviral RNA interference, Williams et al.
(2011) investigated spindle orientation regulation and provided direct
evidence that LGN (609245), NuMA (164009), and dynactin are involved. In
compromising asymmetric cell divisions, Williams et al. (2011) uncovered
profound defects in stratification, differentiation, and barrier
formation, and implicated Notch (190198) signaling as an important
effector. Williams et al. (2011) concluded that asymmetric cell division
components act by reorientating mitotic spindles to achieve
perpendicular divisions, which in turn promote stratification and
differentiation. Furthermore, the resemblance between their knockdown
phenotypes and Rbpj (147183) loss-of-function mutants provided important
clues that suprabasal Notch signaling is impaired when asymmetric cell
divisions do not occur.

GENE STRUCTURE

Collin et al. (1998) found that the DCTN1 gene spans approximately 19.4
kb of genomic DNA and consists of at least 32 exons ranging in size from
15 to 499 bp.

Pushkin et al. (2001) showed by Southern blot and BAC analyses that the
DCTN1 and SLC4A5 (606757) proteins are encoded by a single locus. The
DCTN1-SLC4A5 locus spans approximately 230 kb and contains 66 exons.
Approximately 200 kb encode SLC4A5. DCTN1 is encoded by exons 1 through
alternative exon 32. The same locus therefore uniquely encodes both a
membrane protein (SLC4A5) and a cytoplasmic protein (DCTN1) with
distinct functions.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Holzbaur and Tokito (1996) mapped
the DCTN1 gene to 2p13. They noted that the location of the gene
corresponds to that of a form of recessive limb-girdle muscular
dystrophy (see LGMD2B; 253601). Also, this region of human chromosome 2
shows syntenic homology with a region of mouse chromosome 6 containing
the mnd2 mouse mutation, which exhibits symptoms resembling human motor
neuron disease.

Korthaus et al. (1997) presented evidence that the DCTN1 gene maps to
chromosome 2 between TGFA and D2S1394.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Puls et al. (2003) identified a gly59-to-ser mutation (601143.0001) in
the DCTN1 gene in a family with slowly progressive autosomal dominant
distal hereditary motor neuronopathy with vocal paresis (HMN7B; 607641).

Among 250 patients with a putative diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS; 105400), Munch et al. (2004) identified 3 mutations in
the DCTN1 gene (601143.0002-601143.0004) in 3 families. The authors
distinguished the phenotype in their patients from that reported by Puls
et al. (2003) by the presence of upper motor neuron signs, although
specific clinical details were lacking. Munch et al. (2004) suggested
that mutations in the DCTN1 gene may be a susceptibility factor for ALS.

In affected members of 8 families with Perry syndrome (168605), Farrer
et al. (2009) identified 5 different heterozygous mutations in the DCTN1
gene (see, e.g., 601143.0006-601143.0007). In vitro functional
expression studies indicated that the mutations resulted in decreased
microtubule binding and intracytoplasmic inclusions.

Vilarino-Guell et al. (2009) sequenced the DCTN1 gene in 286 individuals
with Parkinson disease (PD; 168600), frontotemporal lobar degeneration
(FTLD; 600274), or ALS. None of the 36 variants identified segregated
conclusively within families, suggesting that DCTN1 mutations are rare
and do not play a common role in these diseases. Further analysis of 440
patients with PD, 374 with FTLD, and 372 with ALS without a family
history also failed to find an association between DCTN1 variants and
disease. In fact, the previously reported pathogenic mutation T1249I
(601143.0002) was identified in 3 of 435 controls and did not segregate
in a large pedigree with Parkinson disease, thus weakening the evidence
for the pathogenicity of this variant.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
NEURONOPATHY, DISTAL HEREDITARY MOTOR, TYPE VIIB
DCTN1, GLY59SER

In a North American family with a slowly progressive, autosomal dominant
form of lower motor neuron with vocal cord paresis but without sensory
symptoms (607641), Puls et al. (2003) found a single-basepair change in
the DCTN1 gene (957C-T) resulting in an amino acid substitution of
serine for glycine at position 59 in affected family members. The G59S
substitution occurred in the highly conserved CAP-Gly motif of the
p150(Glued) subunit of dynactin, a domain that binds directly to
microtubules. The transport protein dynactin is required for
dynein-mediated retrograde transport of vesicles and organelles along
microtubules. Overexpression of dynamitin (607376), the p50 subunit of
the dynactin complex, disrupts the complex and produces a late-onset,
progressive motor neuron disease in transgenic mice (LaMonte et al.,
2002).

Based on crystal structure, gly59 is embedded in a beta-sheet. In
budding yeast, Moore et al. (2009) generated a G59S-analogous mutation
that resulted in complete loss of the CAP-Gly domain. Functional
expression studies showed that the CAP-Gly domain has a critical role in
the initiation and persistence of dynein-dependent movement of the
mitotic spindle and nucleus, but was otherwise dispensable for
dynein-based movement. The function also appeared to be
context-dependent, such as during mitosis, indicating that CAP-Gly
activity may only be necessary when dynein needs to overcome high force
thresholds to produce movement. The CAP-Gly domain was not the primary
link between dynactin and microtubules, although it was involved in the
interaction.

.0002
AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
DCTN1, THR1249ILE

In a woman with a disorder similar to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(105400), Munch et al. (2004) identified a heterozygous 4546C-T
transition in exon 13 of the DCTN1 gene, resulting in a thr1249-to-ile
(T1249I) substitution. She had disease onset at age 56 years, with gait
disturbance and distal lower limb muscle weakness and atrophy. The
symptoms were slowly progressive over 4 years. There was no involvement
of the upper limbs or bulbar region. There was no family history. The
mutation was not identified in 150 control subjects. See also 607641.

Vilarino-Guell et al. (2009) identified the T1249I variant in 3 of 435
controls, 5 of 440 patients with Parkinson disease (168600), 1 of 374
with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (600274), and 5 of 372 patients
with ALS. Lack of segregation of the variant in a large pedigree with
Parkinson disease weakened the evidence for the pathogenicity of this
variant.

.0003
AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
DCTN1, MET571THR

In a woman with probable ALS (105400), Munch et al. (2004) identified a
heterozygous 2512T-C transition in exon 15 of the DCTN1 gene, resulting
in a met571-to-thr (M571T) substitution. She had onset of upper limb
involvement at age 48 years and developed bulbar symptoms within 8
years. Her sister was similarly affected, although DNA was not
available. The mutation was not identified in 150 control subjects.

.0004
AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
DCTN1, ARG785TRP

In 2 brothers with probable ALS (105400), Munch et al. (2004) identified
a heterozygous 3153C-T transition in exon 20 of the DCTN1 gene,
resulting in an arg785-to-trp (R785W) substitution. The proband had
upper limb onset at age 55 years, whereas his brother had bulbar onset
at age 64 years. The asymptomatic mother and sister carried the same
mutation, suggesting incomplete penetrance. The mutation was not
identified in 150 control subjects.

.0005
AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
DCTN1, ARG1101LYS

In a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (105400), Munch et al.
(2005) identified a heterozygous 4102G-A transition in the DCTN1 gene,
resulting in an arg1101-to-lys (R1101K) substitution. The patient's
brother, who also carried the R1101K mutation, had frontotemporal
dementia without motor involvement. Family history revealed that 2
additional family members reportedly had motor neuron disease and
frontotemporal dementia, respectively, but their DNA was not available
for testing. The mutation was not identified in 500 control individuals.
Despite the molecular findings, Munch et al. (2005) suggested that the
R1101K variant may not be the primary gene defect in this family.

.0006
PERRY SYNDROME
DCTN1, GLY71ARG

In affected members of 2 unrelated families with Perry syndrome
(168605), Farrer et al. (2009) identified a heterozygous 211G-A
transition in exon 2 of the DCTN1 gene, resulting in a gly71-to-arg
(G71R) substitution in a highly conserved residue within the GKNDG
binding motif of the CAP-Gly domain. The families were of Canadian and
Turkish ancestry, respectively, and haplotype analysis excluded a
founder effect. In vitro functional expression studies showed that the
mutation decreased microtubule binding and resulted in intracytoplasmic
inclusions.

.0007
PERRY SYNDROME
DCTN1, GLN74PRO

In affected members of a Japanese family with Perry syndrome (168605),
Farrer et al. (2009) identified a heterozygous 221A-C transversion in
exon 2 of the DCTN1 gene, resulting in a gln74-to-pro (Q74P)
substitution in a highly conserved residue adjacent to the GKNDG binding
motif of the CAP-Gly domain. In vitro functional expression studies
showed that the mutation decreased microtubule binding and resulted in
intracytoplasmic inclusions.

608451	TITLE *608451 ETHE1 GENE; ETHE1
;;HEPATOMA SUBTRACTED CLONE ONE; HSCO;;
D83198
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ETHE1 gene encodes a mitochondrial sulfur dioxygenase involved in
the catabolism of sulfide. It is a homodimer bound by a single iron atom
and functions as a beta-lactamase-like iron-coordinating metalloprotein
(summary by Tiranti et al., 2009).

CLONING

Higashitsuji et al. (2002) identified the HSCO gene as a novel protein
expressed in hepatoma that accelerates export of NFKB (see 164011) from
the nucleus and inhibits p53 (191170)-dependent apoptosis. By
homozygosity mapping and integrative genomics analysis, Tiranti et al.
(2004) identified HSCO, also known as D83198 (GenBank GENBANK D83198),
as the gene in chromosome 19q13 responsible for ethylmalonic
encephalopathy (602473) when mutated. They renamed the gene ETHE1 in
light of its relationship to the disorder. The ETHE1 protein is a
phylogenetically conserved protein that shares high homology with GLO2
(138760). Northern blot analysis showed ubiquitous expression of ETHE1
as a single transcript of approximately 1,000 nucleotides. The protein
contains an N-terminal sequence of 24 amino acids whose residues show
similarity to those of mitochondrial leader peptides. The ETHE1 protein
is targeted to mitochondria and internalized into the matrix after
energy-dependent cleavage of the leader peptide.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tiranti et al. (2004) determined that the ETHE1 gene contains 7 exons.

GENE FUNCTION

Sulfide is detoxified by a mitochondrial pathway that includes a sulfur
dioxygenase. Tiranti et al. (2009) demonstrated that sulfur dioxygenase
activity was markedly increased by ETHE1 overexpression in HeLa cells
and E. coli. These findings indicated that ETHE1 is a mitochondrial
sulfur dioxygenase involved in catabolism of sulfide.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By a combination of homozygosity mapping, integration of physical and
functional genomic datasets, and mutational screening, Tiranti et al.
(2004) identified the ETHE1 gene and mutations in it responsible for
ethylmalonic encephalopathy (EE; 602473), a devastating infantile
metabolic disorder in which high levels of ethylmalonic acid are
detected in the body fluids, and cytochrome c oxidase activity is
decreased in skeletal muscle. The severe consequences of its
malfunctioning indicate an important role of the ETHE1 gene product in
mitochondrial homeostasis and energy metabolism. Tiranti et al. (2004)
showed that the ETHE1 gene is located on 19q13 by linkage mapping.
Because of the clinical and biochemical features of EE, they assumed
that the responsible protein is likely to be involved in mitochondrial
metabolism. After excluding 2 such known genes that map to 19q13, they
selected candidate genes that predicted proteins of unknown function,
which may potentially be involved in mitochondria. For this, they
followed an integrated genomics approach that was originally developed
(Mootha et al., 2003) to identify LRPPRC (607544), mutations in which
are responsible for 1 form of cytochrome c oxidase deficiency (220111).
According to this strategy, a 'neighborhood index' was given to all
genes of the critical region; this index reflected the similarity of
their RNA expression profiles to those of known mitochondrial genes.
Through sequencing of the 7 exons of the ETHE1 gene, Tiranti et al.
(2004) found homozygous mutations in all probands from the 4
consanguineous families originally used for gene mapping, as well as in
a fifth family originally presumed nonconsanguineous. The proband in a
sixth family was a compound heterozygote. Mutations were also found in 8
additional probands belonging to 4 consanguineous and 2
nonconsanguineous families, as well as in 4 unrelated singleton
patients. Most of the 16 different mutations were loss-of-function
mutations producing a stop, a frameshift, or aberrant splicing. In one
consanguineous family, the entire gene was missing, and in 2 others,
exon 4 was missing in both alleles. They detected 6 missense mutations,
all predicting amino acid changes in highly conserved positions.

Even though ethylmalonic encephalopathy has been described mainly in
families from the Mediterranean basin and the Arabian peninsula, Tiranti
et al. (2004) obtained no evidence of the existence of an ancestral
haplotype or a cluster of common mutations in their cohort of patients
with EE. Since the initial report, no more than 30 cases of EE had been
described worldwide, leading to the assumption that EE is a very rare
disorder. However, the actual incidence of this condition could have
been significantly underestimated because the biochemical phenotype was
incorrectly attributed to other metabolic disorders, particularly
defects of the mitochondrial electron-transfer flavoprotein pathway.

In 14 patients with ethylmalonic encephalopathy, Mineri et al. (2008)
identified homozygosity for mutations in the ETHE1 gene (see, e.g.,
608451.0006 and 608451.0007). At the time of the report, 11 patients
were deceased; age of death ranged from 18 months to 3 years. Three
patients were alive at 6 months, 7 years, and 13 years, respectively.

Kabil and Banerjee (2012) isolated the ETHE1 enzyme and determined its
kinetic properties by studying the rate of oxygen consumption during
conversion of glutathione persulfide (GSSH) to sulfite. Two mutant
proteins, T152I and D196N, had lower iron content than the wildtype
enzyme. Kinetic studies showed that the T152I enzyme had a 4-fold
decrease in Vmax for the reaction compared to wildtype, whereas Km for
GSSH was unaffected. D196N had a 15% decrease in Vmax and a 2-fold
increase in Km for GSSH compared to wildtype. Both mutant proteins were
less stable than wildtype. These studies did not provide a direct
explanation for the biochemical features of patients with ETHE1
mutations, but did show that the ETHE1 reaction is oxygen-dependent and
may be limited under hypoxic conditions.

ANIMAL MODEL

Tiranti et al. (2009) found that Ethe1-null mice developed the cardinal
features of ethylmalonic encephalopathy, including poor growth, reduced
motor activity, early death, low cytochrome c oxidase (COX) in muscle
and brain, and increased urinary excretion of ethylmalonic acid. Both
mutant mice and humans with the disorder excreted massive amounts of
thiosulfate in the urine, and there was an accumulation of thiosulfate
and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in mutant mouse tissue. Hydrogen sulfide is
powerful inhibitor of COX and short-chain fatty acid oxidation, and has
vasoactive and vasotoxic effects. The findings suggested that
ethylmalonic encephalopathy is a disease associated with impaired
catabolism of inorganic sulfur leading to accumulation of hydrogen
sulfide in key tissues. The toxic effects of this accumulation can
account for several features, including ethylmalonic aciduria, COX
deficiency, microangiopathy, acrocyanosis, and chronic diarrhea. Sulfide
is detoxified by a mitochondrial pathway that includes a sulfur
dioxygenase. Sulfur dioxygenase activity was absent in Ethe1-null mice,
but it was markedly increased by ETHE1 overexpression in HeLa cells and
E. coli. These findings indicated that ETHE1 is a mitochondrial sulfur
dioxygenase involved in catabolism of sulfide that accumulates to toxic
levels in ethylmalonic encephalopathy.

In a patient with ethylmalonic encephalopathy (EE; 602473) from a

in exon 4 of the ETHE1 gene, predicted to result in an arg163-to-trp

had previously been reported by Tiranti et al. (2004).

Drousiotou et al. (2011) identified a homozygous deletion of exon 4 of
the ETHE1 gene in a patient of Greek Cypriot origin with ethylmalonic
encephalopathy. Both parents were heterozygous for the deletion. An
unrelated Greek Cypriot girl was compound heterozygous for the exon 4
deletion and a missense mutation (608451.0008). Haplotype analysis of
both patients and 3 carrier parents showed that the exon 4 deletion
occurred on the same haplotype as that found in Arab patients with the
deletion. Western blot analysis showed complete absence of the ETHE1
protein.

In a girl of Greek Cypriot origin with ethylmalonic encephalopathy

for 2 mutations in the ETHE1 gene: a 554T-G transversion in exon 5,
resulting in a leu185-to-arg (L185R) substitution, and a deletion of
exon 4 (608451.0007). Her mother was heterozygous for the L185R
mutation, and her father was heterozygous for the exon 4 deletion. No
DNA from her deceased older brother was available for testing, but based
on findings in the family was assumed to have the same genotype as his
sister. Western blot analysis showed complete absence of the ETHE1
protein, consistent with the L185R mutant being unstable and degraded.

611508	TITLE *611508 CALMODULIN-BINDING TRANSCRIPTION ACTIVATOR 2; CAMTA2
;;KIAA0909
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned CAMTA2, which they designated
KIAA0909. The deduced protein contains 1,234 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected high expression in adult and fetal brain and in all specific
brain regions examined. Moderate expression was detected in all other
tissues examined.

By searching for genes similar to a plant Camta, Bouche et al. (2002)
identified human CAMTA1 (611501) and CAMTA2. Both deduced proteins
contain an N-terminal DNA-binding CG1 domain, followed by a central
transcription factor immunoglobulin (TIG) domain, 2 ankyrin repeats for
protein-protein interactions, and 4 C-terminal calmodulin
(114180)-binding IQ motifs. The CG1 domain includes a nuclear
localization signal.

Song et al. (2006) found that human CAMTA1 was expressed specifically in
heart, brain, and skeletal muscle. Northern blot analysis of mouse
tissues showed highest Camta1 expression in heart and brain, with lower
expression in other tissues. Camta2 was not expressed in mouse heart
during embryogenesis, but its expression was upregulated after birth.
Isolated cardiomyocytes showed high Camta1 expression compared with
whole heart.

GENE FUNCTION

Bouche et al. (2002) found that CAMTA1 and CAMTA2 activated
transcription of a reporter gene in yeast.

Song et al. (2006) showed that mouse Camta1 and Camta2 activated the Anf
(NPPA; 108780) promoter. Camta2 enhanced the ability of Nkx2.5 (NKX2E;
600584) to activate the Anf promoter by about 8-fold. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation assays of primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes showed
that Camta2 associated with the Nkx2.5 response element in the Anf
promoter. In transfected COS cells, coexpression of Nkx2.5 with Camta2
enhanced association of Camta2 with the Anf promoter. Camta2 showed
nuclear and cytoplasmic localization in transfected COS cells.
Inhibition of nuclear export led to accumulation of Camta2 in the
nucleus, and coexpression with Nkx2.5, which is exclusively nuclear,
resulted in nuclear localization of Camta2. Mutation analysis showed
that the CG1 and TIG domains of Camta2 mediated its interaction with
Nkx2.5. Overexpression of Camta2 in primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes
led to hypertrophy, and transgenic mice overexpressing heart-targeted
Camta2 were highly susceptible to sudden death and had grossly enlarged
hearts with extensive cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Song et al. (2006)
found that Camta2 associated with Hdac5 (605315), which prevented Anf
promoter activation and hypertrophy in response to Camta2. Protein
kinase C-epsilon (PRKCE; 176975) and protein kinase D (PRKCM; 605435),
which act in hypertrophic signaling, stimulated Camta2 transcriptional
activity by causing dissociation of Camta2 from Hdac5.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the CAMTA2
gene to chromosome 17.

ANIMAL MODEL

Song et al. (2006) found that Camta2-null mice were viable and fertile
with no obvious cardiac defects, but they were unable to mount maximal
hypertrophic responses to diverse stimuli.

138491	TITLE *138491 GLYCINE RECEPTOR, ALPHA-1 SUBUNIT; GLRA1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The GLRA1 gene encodes the alpha-1 subunit of the glycine receptor, a
ligand-gated chloride channel. This inhibitory glycine receptor mediates
postsynaptic inhibition in the spinal cord and other regions of the
central nervous system. It is a pentameric receptor composed of alpha
and beta subunits. (Grenningloh et al., 1990). The GLRB gene (138492)
encodes the beta subunit of the receptor.

CLONING

From a human fetal brain cDNA library, Grenningloh et al. (1990)
isolated 2 cDNAs encoding 2 forms of the strychnine-binding subunit of
the inhibitory glycine receptor, alpha-1 and alpha-2 (GLRA2; 305990).
The predicted 449-amino acid sequence of GLRA1 shows approximately 99%
identity to the rat 48-kD polypeptide.

GENE STRUCTURE

Siren et al. (2006) noted that the GLRA1 gene contains 9 exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis and in situ hybridization, Warrington et
al. (1992) and Shiang et al. (1993) mapped the GLRA1 gene to chromosome
5q33-q35. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Baker et al. (1994)
mapped the GLRA1 gene to chromosome 5q32.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Lape et al. (2008) investigated partial agonists for 2 members of the
nicotinic superfamily, the muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor
(100690) and the glycine receptor, and found that the open-shut reaction
is similar for both full and partial agonists, but the response to
partial agonists is limited by an earlier conformation change (flipping)
that takes place when the channel is still shut. Lape et al. (2008)
suggested that their observations have implications for the
interpretation of structural studies and for the design of partial
agonists for therapeutic use.

GENE FUNCTION

In Xenopus oocytes and human embryonic kidney cells, Laube et al. (2000)
found that low concentrations (10 microM) of extracellular zinc
increased both the opening frequency and mean burst duration of the
glycine receptor. In contrast, higher levels of zinc (50-500 microM)
reduced the open probability of the glycine receptor mainly by
decreasing the open frequency and the relative contribution of the
longest burst of the single-channel events. Site-directed mutagenesis
identified the asp80 and thr112 codons in the GLRA1 gene as important
determinants of zinc potentiation and inhibition, respectively. The
findings indicated that zinc modulates different steps of the receptor
binding and gating cycle via specific allosteric high- and low-affinity
binding sites in the extracellular N-terminal region of the GLRA1
subunit.

Hutchinson et al. (2008) reported a 54-year-old man with clinical
features of progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus
(PERM; see 184850) associated with serum GLRA1 autoantibodies. There was
no evidence of malignancy. The clinical course was progressive,
beginning with tingling sensation and spontaneous violent jerks of the
limbs and trunk. He later developed ptosis, horizontal gaze palsies,
facial weakness, spinal rigidity, and difficulty walking. Aggressive
immunosuppressive therapy resulted in significant improvement. The
authors noted that mutations in the GLRA1 gene result in hereditary
hyperekplexia (149400), which is characterized by excessive startle
response. Hutchinson et al. (2008) postulated that anti-GLRA1 antibodies
may disrupt glycinergic inhibition in the brainstem and spinal cord.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 4 different families with autosomal dominant hereditary
hyperekplexia-1 (HKPX1; 149400), Shiang et al. (1993) identified 2
different heterozygous point mutations in exon 6 of the GLRA1 gene
(138491.0001-138491.0002).

Rees et al. (2001) described an apparently sporadic case of
hyperekplexia in an offspring of a consanguineous mating who was
homozygous for a mutation in the GLRA1 gene (138491.0003). Thus, human
startle disease can display recessive, as well as dominant, inheritance
depending on the mutation in GLRA1; this is analogous to the recessive
inheritance of the mouse mutant 'spasmodic.'

In a case of recessively inherited hyperekplexia, Brune et al. (1996)
found a deletion of exons 1-6 of the GLRA1 gene. Born to consanguineous
parents, the affected child was homozygous for this null allele,
consistent with complete loss of gene function. The child displayed
exaggerated startle responses and pronounced head-retraction jerks
reflecting a disinhibition of vestigial brainstem reflexes. In contrast,
proprio- and exteroceptive inhibition of muscle activity previously
correlated to glycinergic mechanisms were not affected. From studying
this patient, the authors concluded that, in contrast to the lethal
effect of a null mutation in the recessive mouse mutant 'oscillator' in
the Glra1 gene, the loss of the glycine receptor alpha-1 subunit is
effectively compensated in man.

Rees et al. (2001) analyzed the GLRA1 gene in 22 unrelated individuals
with hyperekplexia and hyperekplexia-related conditions and reported
several novel missense mutations and the first nonsense point mutations
in GLRA1, most of which were localized outside the regions previously
associated with dominant, disease-segregating mutations. The studies
corroborated the existence of a recessive form of hyperekplexia. They
found that a proportion of sporadic hyperekplexia is accounted for by
the homozygous inheritance of recessive GLRA1 mutations or as part of
compound heterozygosity.

ANIMAL MODEL

The mouse mutant phenotype 'spasmodic' (spd) is inherited as a recessive
disorder and is phenotypically similar to hyperekplexia, including an
altered startle response. The spd gene maps to mouse chromosome 11 in a
region that shows extensive syntenic homology to human 5q21-q32. In
studies of the lethal neurologic mutant mouse 'oscillator,' Buckwalter
et al. (1994) demonstrated that the mutation maps to mouse chromosome 11
and is allelic to 'spasmodic.' They demonstrated that oscillator is
caused by a microdeletion in the Glra1 gene. The oscillator deletion
causes a frameshift resulting in loss of the highly conserved third
cytoplasmic loop and fourth transmembrane domain of the protein.

In mice, Becker et al. (1992) showed that the neonatal Glra2 (305990)
subunit is expressed in the first and second postnatal weeks, and is
later replaced by the adult Glra1 subunit. This isoform switch is
responsible for the relatively later onset of neuromotor symptoms at the
end of the second postnatal week in spasmodic and oscillator mice, who
have mutant Glra1 subunits.

Hirzel et al. (2006) generated transgenic mice with homozygous D80A
mutation in the Glra1 gene. The substitution selectively eliminates a
region in the N-terminal extracellular domain to which zinc binds and
potentiates glycine receptor currents at low zinc concentrations. Mutant
D80A mice showed a phenotype that was similar to human hyperekplexia,
with increased neuromuscular tone, inducible tremor, and abnormal gait.
Detailed neurophysiologic studies showed that mutant mice had impaired
glycinergic suppression of cone signal transmission and increased
response to sudden loud acoustic stimuli. In vitro studies of spinal
neurons and brainstem slices showed that the D80A substitution in Glra1
selectively suppressed zinc-mediated potentiation of synaptic inhibitory
glycine-receptor currents in the presence of low zinc concentrations
compared to wildtype Glra1. Thus, the phenotype in mutant D80A mice
specifically resulted from impaired zinc potentiation rather than from a
reduction or malfunction of mutant glycine receptors. The findings
demonstrated the importance of zinc for proper glycinergic
neurotransmission.

HYPEREKPLEXIA 1, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
GLRA1, ARG271LEU

In affected members of a large 5-generation family with hereditary
hyperekplexia-1 (HKPX1; 149400) originally reported by Ryan et al.
(1992), Shiang et al. (1993) identified a heterozygous 1192G-T
transversion in exon 6 of the GLRA1 gene, resulting in an arg271-to-leu
(R271L) substitution in the extracellular domain adjacent to the second
transmembrane domain. The mutation was not found in 50 control
individuals.

Rajendra et al. (1994) demonstrated that the R271L mutation causes a
significant decrease in the binding affinity for glycine and a decrease
in the sensitivity of receptor currents activated by glycine, thus
reducing glycinergic inhibitory neurotransmission by producing receptors
with diminished agonist responsiveness.

.0002
HYPEREKPLEXIA 1, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
GLRA1, ARG271GLN

In affected members of 3 families with hyperekplexia-1 (149400), Shiang
et al. (1993) identified a heterozygous 1192G-A transversion in exon 6
of the GLRA1 gene, resulting in an arg271-to-gln (R271Q) substitution in
the extracellular domain adjacent to the second transmembrane domain.
One of the families had previously been reported by Ryan et al. (1992).

Rees et al. (1994) demonstrated the R271Q mutation in affected members
of a U.K. family showing autosomal dominant transmission of startle
disease.

In a 17-year-old Swiss girl who had had numerous episodes of falling and
myoclonia in response to stimuli, Schorderet et al. (1994) identified a
heterozygous 1192G-A mutation in the GLRA1 gene. Her older sister and
mother also suffered from abnormal startle reflex.

Rajendra et al. (1994) demonstrated that the R271Q mutation causes a
significant decrease in the binding affinity for glycine and a decrease
in the sensitivity of receptor currents activated by glycine, thus
reducing glycinergic inhibitory neurotransmission by producing receptors
with diminished agonist responsiveness.

Shiang et al. (1995) reported an additional 5 hyperekplexia families
with the 1192G-A mutation. Haplotype analysis suggested that this
mutation has arisen at least twice and possibly 4 times.

Elmslie et al. (1996) found the R271Q mutation in 2 of 8 probands with
familial hyperekplexia.

.0003
HYPEREKPLEXIA 1, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
GLRA1, ILE244ASN

In an apparently sporadic case of startle disease (149400) in the
offspring of a consanguineous marriage, Rees et al. (1994) identified
homozygosity for a 1112T-A transversion in the GLRA1 gene, resulting in
an ile244-to-asn (I244N) substitution. Both parents and 1 asymptomatic
sister were heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found in 300
control chromosomes. The 22-year-old patient was 1 of 6 children of a
Welsh gypsy family of Romany origin who presented with a long history of
recurrent injurious falls. She gave a history of excessive startle and
repeated falls in response to sudden, unexpected stimuli. She fell with
arms held stiffly by her side and had over the years sustained multiple
injuries to body, face, head, and knees. No abnormality was detected on
MRI scan. Treated with clonazepam, 4 mg daily, she had no more falls and
could walk up and down stairs and outside on her own. The phenotype was
indistinguishable from that of dominant hyperekplexia.

HYPEREKPLEXIA 1, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
GLRA1, TYR279CYS

In 2 families segregating autosomal dominant hyperekplexia (149400),
Shiang et al. (1995) identified a tyr279-to-cys (Y279C) substitution.

.0005
HYPEREKPLEXIA 1, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
GLRA1, GLN266HIS

In an Italian family with hereditary hyperekplexia (149400), Milani et
al. (1996) identified a mutation in the GLRA1 gene, resulting in a
gln266-to-his (Q266H) amino acid substitution.

.0006
HYPEREKPLEXIA 1, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
GLRA1, LYS276GLU

In a family in which affected members over 4 generations had both
hyperekplexia (149400) and spastic paraparesis, Elmslie et al. (1996)
identified a heterozygous 1206A-G transition in exon 6 of the GLRA1
gene, resulting in a lys276-to-glu (K276E) substitution.

In a family from the northeast of Italy with autosomal dominant
transmission of startle disease, Seri et al. (1997) demonstrated
heterozygosity for the K276E mutation. They noted that the mutation
eliminated a StyI restriction site. The affected members of the Italian
family had a classic presentation with neonatal rigidity and exaggerated
startle response to acoustic or tactile stimuli.

.0007
HYPEREKPLEXIA 1, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
GLRA1, PRO250THR

In a pedigree with dominant transmission of hyperekplexia (149400), Saul
et al. (1999) identified a mutation in the GLRA1 gene, resulting in a
pro250-to-thr (P250T) substitution. The mutation was predicted to be in
the cytoplasmic loop linking transmembrane regions M1 and M2 of the
mature alpha-1 polypeptide. After recombinant expression, homomeric
mutant subunit channels showed a strong reduction of maximum whole-cell
chloride currents and an altered desensitization, consistent with a
prolonged recovery from desensitization.

.0008
HYPEREKPLEXIA 1, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
GLRA1, 1-BP DEL, 601C

In a sporadic case of hyperekplexia (149400), Rees et al. (2001)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the GLRA1 gene:
maternal transmission of a 1-bp deletion of C from a run of 4 Cs at
nucleotides 601-605 in exon 4 of the GLRA1 gene, resulting in a
truncated GLRA1 polypeptide, and paternal transmission of an 830A-G
transition in exon 5A, resulting in a met147-to-val (M147V) amino acid
change (138491.0009). The mutations resulted in an ineffective maternal
transcript and a paternal transcript representing the sole contributor
of the glycine receptor alpha-1 subunit polypeptides. Electrophysiologic
responses were unable to demonstrate differences between wildtype and
M147V whole-cell concentration-response curves, indicating that ligand
binding and macroscopic ion channel function were not affected by the
mutation. It remained, however, that compound heterozygosity of 830A-G
and 601delC in this patient was associated with the onset of
hyperekplexia, while parental and sib carriers of either mutation were
asymptomatic.

.0009
HYPEREKPLEXIA 1, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
GLRA1, MET147VAL

See (138491.0008) and Rees et al. (2001).

.0010
HYPEREKPLEXIA 1, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
GLRA1, TYR202TER

Rees et al. (2001) observed a patient with hyperekplexia (149400) and
homozygosity for a 986C-A transversion in exon 5B of the GLRA1 gene,
resulting in a tyr202-to-ter (Y202X) premature stop codon. This was the
first reported incidence of a nonsense mutation and the second of a null
GLRA1 genotype, the first having been described by Brune et al. (1996)
on the basis of a deletion. The Pakistani parents were consanguineous
and heterozygous carriers. This family confirmed that, in contrast to
the murine model oscillator, the complete loss of human glycine
receptor-mediated neurotransmission is not lethal (Buckwalter et al.,
1994).

.0011
HYPEREKPLEXIA 1, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
GLRA1, VAL260MET

Del Giudice et al. (2001) identified an 1158G-A transition in exon 6 of
the GLRA1 gene in an Italian family with hyperekplexia (149400). The
mutation was present in heterozygous state in the index patient, a
12-month-old boy with muscular hypertonia and exaggerated startle
response, and in his father who had suffered from abnormal startle
responses and 'a sort of rigidity' during early infancy. The mutation
resulted in a val260-to-met (V260M) substitution near the center of the
highly conserved M2 transmembrane domain of the mature polypeptide. The
location suggested a role in altering ion channel properties. The
mutation was not found in 150 Italian controls.

.0012
HYPEREKPLEXIA 1, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
GLRA1, SER231ARG

In an apparently sporadic case of startle disease (149400), Humeny et
al. (2002) identified homozygosity for a 1073C-G transversion in exon 7
of the GLRA1 gene, leading to a ser231-to-arg (S231R) substitution in
transmembrane region TM1. The patient was the 6-year-old son of
apparently healthy consanguineous parents of Iranian origin. Both
parents and 1 asymptomatic sister were heterozygous for the S231R
mutation. The proband presented with nocturnal generalized jerks
accompanied by short-windedness and slight trembling from birth, and at
age 6 years displayed increased muscle proprioceptive reflexes,
exaggerated head retraction jerks, myoclonia, atactic gait disturbances,
and mild mental retardation. Functional analysis by immunoblotting
demonstrated a marked reduction of receptor expression in membrane
fractions from cells transfected with the mutant compared to wildtype,
and cells transfected with the mutant plasmid displayed a strong
reduction of the maximal current. Confocal laser scanning microscopy of
transfected cells showed predominant localization in the plasma membrane
of wildtype receptors, whereas mutant receptors were mostly distributed
intracellularly. The observations suggested that the recessive phenotype
may be a consequence of a dramatic loss of functional receptor in the
homozygous state.

.0013
HYPEREKPLEXIA 1, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
GLRA1, 170-KB DEL

In affected members of 2 consanguineous Turkish Kurd families with
hyperekplexia (149400), Siren et al. (2006) identified a homozygous
170-kb deletion, beginning 93 kb upstream of the start codon of the
GLRA1 gene and including exons 1 to 7. The deletion breakpoints were
determined to be the same as that reported by Gilbert et al. (2004) in
another affected Turkish Kurd family. Siren et al. (2006) suggested a
founder effect.

.0014
HYPEREKPLEXIA 1, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
GLRA1, SER296TER

In a boy with hyperekplexia (149400), Bellini et al. (2007) identified a
de novo 1267C-A transversion in exon 7 of the GLRA1 gene, resulting in a
ser296-to-ter (S296X) substitution in the transmembrane 3 domain.
Functional expression studies in HEK293 cells showed that the mutant
protein failed to elicit chloride currents. Coexpression with the
wildtype protein resulted in smaller currents, indicating a
dominant-negative effect of the mutant protein. The findings indicated
that the mutant protein is expressed and leaves the endoplasmic
reticulum, but interacts with normal subunits to suppress normal GLRA1
channel function.

.0015
HYPEREKPLEXIA 1, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
GLRA1, SER267ASN

In a father and son with hyperekplexia (149400), Becker et al. (2008)
identified a heterozygous 1180G-A transition in exon 7 of the GLRA1
gene, resulting in a ser267-to-asn (S267N) substitution in
transmembrane-2, close to the extracellular opening of the glycine
channel. The son had onset shortly after birth, whereas the father had a
milder phenotype with later onset. In vitro functional expression
studies showed that the mutant channel had similar maximum currents as
the wildtype channel, but significantly decreased affinity for glycine.
Glycine affinity was reduced about 2.3-fold in cells cotransfected with
the mutant and wildtype channels. Tests with other agonists, including
taurine and alanine, also showed decreased binding to the mutant
channel, resulting in the conversion of these agonists to functional
antagonists. There was also decreased modulation of the mutant channel
by ethanol.

;;N-ACETYLGALACTOSAMINE-4-O-SULFOTRANSFERASE 1;;
GalNAc4 SULFOTRANSFERASE 1; GalNAc4ST1;;
GalNAc4ST
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Sulfate groups in carbohydrates confer highly specific functions on
glycoproteins, glycolipids, and proteoglycans and are critical for
cell-cell interaction, signal transduction, and embryonic development.
Sulfotransferases, such as CHST8, carry out sulfation of carbohydrates
(Hiraoka et al., 2001).

CLONING

By searching for sequences similar to the C-terminal region of rat
Hnk1st (CHST10; 606376), followed by RACE of a fetal brain cDNA library,
Xia et al. (2000) cloned CHST8, which they designated GalNAc4ST1. The
deduced 424-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 48.8
kD. It has an N-terminal transmembrane domain, followed by putative
5-prime-phosphosulfonate- and 3-prime-phosphate-binding sites and 3
additional regions conserved in other sulfotransferases. GalNAc4ST1 has
4 potential N-glycosylation sites. Xia et al. (2000) also identified a
GalNAc4ST1 isoform beginning with met119 that lacks the transmembrane
domain. A second soluble GalNAc4ST1 form, derived by proteolytic
cleavage of the transmembrane region, was secreted by transfected
Chinese hamster ovary cells. Northern blot analysis showed a prominent
2.4-kb transcript in brain. Lower expression was detected in liver,
heart, and pancreas, and very low expression was detected in skeletal
muscle. RNA dot blot analysis confirmed high expression of GalNAc4ST1 in
the central nervous system, particularly in pituitary gland, cerebellum,
pons, medulla oblongata, thalamus, and spinal cord. Fetal brain also
showed high expression.

Okuda et al. (2000) and Hiraoka et al. (2001) independently cloned human
CHST8 from fetal brain and pituitary gland cDNA libraries, respectively.
By Northern blot analysis, Hiraoka et al. (2001) detected a transcript
of 2.4 kb expressed at high levels in fetal and adult brain and in
spinal cord. Moderate expression was detected in adult liver, kidney,
and heart. Skeletal muscle expressed a transcript of 1.0 kb. RT-PCR
detected high expression in pituitary gland.

GENE FUNCTION

Xia et al. (2000) assayed GalNAc4ST1 sulfotransferase activity in
lysates of transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells. Membrane-bound
GalNAc4ST1 transferred sulfate to the C4 hydroxyl of terminal
beta-1,4-linked GalNAc residues in GalNAc-beta-1,4-GlcNAc-beta-R. It
sulfated bovine parotid carbonic anhydrase VI (CA6; 114780) and bovine
luteinizing hormone (LH; see 152780), but not chondroitin. In contrast,
the 2 truncated soluble forms of GalNAc4ST1 sulfated both
GalNAc-beta-1,4-GlcNAc-beta-R and chondroitin. The results suggested
that the first 118 amino acids of GalNAc4ST1 determine substrate
specificity.

Okuda et al. (2000) found that human GalNAc4ST expressed by COS-7 cells
sulfated carbonic anhydrase VI and synthetic p-nitrophenyl GalNAc, but
not chondroitin or desulfated dermatan sulfate.

Hiraoka et al. (2001) confirmed that GalNAc4ST1 transferred sulfate to
C4 of GalNAc in the context of GalNAc-beta-1,4-GlcNAc-beta-1-R in both
N- and O-glycans; products were monosulfated.

GENE STRUCTURE

Xia et al. (2000) determined that the CHST8 gene contains 4 exons and
spans about 88 kb. Exon 1 is noncoding.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Xia et al. (2000) mapped the CHST8 gene to
chromosome 19q13.1.

ANIMAL MODEL

Luteinizing hormone (LH) bears a unique N-linked N-acetylgalactosamine
that mediates the clearance of LH from blood, and GalNAc4ST1 is
responsible for sulfate addition to GalNAc on LH. Mi et al. (2008) found
that Chst8 -/- mice exhibited increased levels of circulating LH. Mutant
male mice had elevated levels of testosterone and precocious maturation
of testis and seminal vesicles. Mutant female mice had elevated estrogen
levels, precocious sexual maturation, increased fecundity, and remained
in estrus for prolonged periods and produced almost 50% more litters
than wildtype mice over the same period of time. Mi et al. (2008)
concluded that sulfate modification of LH by GalNAc4ST1 plays a central
role in regulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonad axis.

184753	TITLE *184753 STEROID 5-ALPHA-REDUCTASE 1; SRD5A1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Steroid 5-alpha-reductase (EC 1.3.99.5) catalyzes the conversion of
testosterone into the more potent androgen, dihydrotestosterone (DHT).
Also see SRD5A2 (607306).

CLONING

Andersson and Russell (1990) described the structure of a cDNA encoding
human steroid 5-alpha-reductase. Sequence analysis indicated that the
enzyme is a hydrophobic protein of 259 amino acids with a predicted
molecular mass of 29,462 Da. The human and rat proteins share 60%
sequence identity.

MAPPING

Using a cDNA isolated from a prostate cDNA library for analysis of
Chinese hamster/human somatic cell hybrid lines, Hsieh et al. (1991)
demonstrated that the steroid 5-alpha-reductase gene is located on
chromosome 5 and on 5pter-q13 in a regional mapping panel. By in situ
hybridization, the gene was localized to 5p15.

Hsieh et al. (1991) mapped the homologous gene (Srd5a-1) to mouse
chromosome 13 in a panel of Chinese hamster or rat/mouse somatic cell
hybrids and by study of recombinant inbred strains. A human pseudogene
was found in the Xq24-qter region; no such gene was found in the mouse.
Also see Jenkins et al. (1991).

GENE FAMILY

By bioinformatic analysis of SRD5A gene family members, Cantagrel et al.
(2010) showed that proteins with a steroid 5-alpha-reductase domain
could be separated into 3 groups. SRD5A1 and SRD5A1 belonged to 1 group,
whereas SRD5A3 (611715), which is a polyprenol reductase, and its yeast
ortholog Dfg10, constituted a second group. The third group consisted of
TECR (610057), which is an enoyl reductase, and TECRL (or SRD5A2L2). The
phylogenetic analysis supported the idea that different classes of
lipids can be substrates for these enzymes and suggested that the
substrate of the enzyme encoded by the common ancestral gene was
potentially not a steroid.

GENE FUNCTION

Harris et al. (1992) concluded that SRD5A1 is a minor component of the
reductase activity in prostate although the gene was originally cloned
from prostate. On the other hand, SRD5A1 appears to be the predominant
isozyme of steroid 5-alpha-reductase in the scalp and elsewhere in the
skin. The possibility of scalp-selective inhibitors being useful in the
treatment of male pattern baldness, acne, and hirsutism, all 'disorders'
that appear to be dihydrotestosterone dependent, was raised.

Investigating by immunoblotting the tissue-specific and developmental
expression patterns of the 5-alpha-reductase isozymes, Thigpen et al.
(1993) showed that the type 1 isozyme is not detectable in the fetus, is
transiently expressed in newborn skin and scalp, and is permanently
expressed in skin from the time of puberty. There was no qualitative
difference in 5-alpha-reductase type 1 expression between adult balding
versus nonbalding scalp. The type 2 isozyme was transiently expressed in
skin and scalp of newborns. Type 2 is the predominant isozyme detectable
in fetal genital skin, in male accessory sex organs, and in the
prostate, including benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate
adenocarcinoma tissues. These results were considered consistent with
5-alpha-reductase type 1 being responsible for the virilization in type
2-deficient subjects (see 264600) during puberty and suggested that the
type 2 isozyme may be an initiating factor in the development of male
pattern baldness.

From a population survey of 828 healthy families comprising 3,000
individuals, Ellis et al. (1998) identified 58 young bald men (aged 18
to 30 years) and 114 older nonbald men (aged 50 to 70 years) for a
case-control comparison. No significant differences were found between
cases and controls in allele, genotype, or haplotype frequencies for
RFLPs related to either the SRD5A1 or the SRD5A2 gene. These findings
suggested that the genes encoding these 5-alpha-reductase isoenzymes are
not associated with male pattern baldness. Ellis et al. (1998) failed to
find a clear inheritance pattern of male pattern baldness.

Jakimiuk et al. (1999) sought to determine if there is increased SRD5A
activity or mRNA expression in polycystic ovaries. SRD5A1 and SRD5A2
mRNAs were measured in thecal (TC) and granulosa (GC) cells from
individual follicles of 18 women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS;
184700) and 26 regularly cycling control women. SRD5A1 and SRD5A2 mRNA
expression was higher in GC than in TC, and SRD5A2 mRNA levels were
approximately 3-fold higher than SRD5A1 mRNA. SRD5A1 and SRD5A2 mRNA
expression was similar in GC from PCOS and control women, but SRD5A mRNA
was decreased in TC from PCOS follicles. The total SRD5A activity was
approximately 4-fold higher in PCOS follicles than in control follicles.
These data demonstrated elevated SRD5A activity in polycystic ovaries
and supported the hypothesis that 5-alpha-reduced androgens may play a
role in the pathogenesis of PCOS.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Jenkins et al. (1992) used RFLPs of the SRD5A1 gene to exclude the gene
as the site of the mutation in classic 5-alpha-reductase deficiency
(pseudovaginal perineoscrotal hypospadias; 264600). They further showed
that in contrast to the major steroid 5-alpha-reductase in the prostate
and cultured skin fibroblasts, which was designated SRD5A2, the
cDNA-encoded enzyme, representing SRD5A1, exhibited a neutral to basic
pH optimum and was much less sensitive to inhibition by the 4-aza
steroid finasteride.

Goodarzi et al. (2006) tested the hypothesis that haplotypes in the
SRD5A1 and SRD5A2 genes are risk factors for PCOS and the severity of
hirsutism in affected women. A total of 287 white women with PCOS and
187 controls participated. Haplotypes within both genes were associated
with PCOS risk. Haplotypes in SRD5A1 but not SRD5A2 were also associated
with the degree of hirsutism in affected women. That only SRD5A1
haplotypes were associated with hirsutism suggested to Goodarzi et al.
(2006) that only this isoform is important in the hair follicle.

614551	TITLE *614551 SERINE INCORPORATOR 5; SERINC5
;;CHROMOSOME 5 OPEN READING FRAME 12; C5ORF12;;
TPO1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SERINC5 belongs to the SERINC family of transmembrane proteins that
facilitate the incorporation of serine into phosphatidylserine and
sphingolipids (Inuzuka et al., 2005).

CLONING

Xu et al. (2003) cloned SERINC5, which they called C5ORF12, from a fetal
brain cDNA library. The deduced 423-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 47 kD. It has 10 transmembrane domains, a putative
N-terminal signal sequence, a TMS/TDE domain, 2 nonclassic zinc-finger
motifs, and sites for N-myristoylation, phosphorylation, and lipoprotein
lipid attachment.

By in situ hybridization of rat brain, Inuzuka et al. (2005) found that
Serinc5 expression was high in white matter, such as external capsule,
corpus callosum, and arbor vitae of cerebellum.

GENE FUNCTION

Inuzuka et al. (2005) found that expression of Serinc5 was downregulated
in rat hippocampal CA fields and dentate gyrus following kainate-induced
seizures. Expression of Serinc5 in E. coli enhanced the activity of
phosphatidylserine synthase (see 612792). Expression of Serinc5 in COS
cells significantly enhanced the activity of both phosphatidylserine
synthase and serine palmitoyltransferase (see 605712).

GENE STRUCTURE

Xu et al. (2003) determined that the SERINC5 gene contains 13 exons and
spans about 145 kb. The 5-prime region is extremely GC rich and includes
a CpG island.

MAPPING

Xu et al. (2003) stated that SERINC5 is represented by a genomic clone
from chromosome 5p13. However, Gross (2012) mapped the SERINC5 gene to
chromosome 5q14.1 based on an alignment of the SERINC5 sequence (GenBank
GENBANK BC101280) with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

609666	TITLE *609666 TWO-PORE SEGMENT CHANNEL 1; TPCN1
;;TWO-PORE CHANNEL 1; TPC1;;
KIAA1169
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Voltage-gated Ca(2+) and Na+ channels have 4 homologous domains, each
containing 6 transmembrane segments, S1 to S6. TPCN1 is similar to these
channels, but it has only 2 domains containing S1 to S6 (Ishibashi et
al., 2000).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Hirosawa et al. (1999) cloned TPCN1, which they designated
KIAA1169. The deduced 775-amino acid protein, which may be N-terminally
truncated, contains motifs associated with ion transport proteins.
RT-PCR ELISA detected robust expression in all adult and fetal tissues
and specific brain regions examined. Highest expression was in heart and
kidney, and lowest expression was in spleen.

Ishibashi et al. (2000) cloned rat Tpcn1, which they called Tpc1. The
deduced 819-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 94.6
kD. It contains 2 homologous domains, each of which has 6 transmembrane
segments (S1 to S6) and a putative pore loop between S5 and S6. Northern
blot analysis detected a 5-kb transcript expressed at highest levels in
rat kidney, followed by liver, lung, and spleen. In rat kidney, Tpc1 was
expressed at the apical membrane of medullary collecting ducts. By EST
database analysis, Ishibashi et al. (2000) identified likely human and
plant orthologs of Tpc1.

GENE FUNCTION

Calcraft et al. (2009) showed that 2-pore channels (TPCs) comprise a
family of nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP)
receptors, with human TPC1 and chicken TPC3 being expressed on endosomal
membranes, and human TPC2 on lysosomal membranes when expressed in
HEK293 cells. Membranes enriched with TPC2 show high affinity NAADP
binding, and TPC2 underpins NAADP-induced Ca(2+) release from
lysosome-related stores that is subsequently amplified by Ca(2+)-induced
Ca(2+) release by inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (InsP3Rs).
Responses to NAADP were abolished by disrupting the lysosomal proton
gradient and by ablating TPC2 expression, but were only attenuated by
depleting endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) stores or by blocking InsP3Rs.
Thus, TPCs form NAADP receptors that release Ca(2+) from acidic
organelles, which can trigger further Ca(2+) signals via
sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum. Calcraft et al. (2009) concluded
that TPCs provide insights into the regulation and organization of
Ca(2+) signals in animal cells.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the TPCN1
gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP D12S1195E).

610492	TITLE *610492 SLAIN MOTIF FAMILY, MEMBER 2; SLAIN2
;;KIAA1458
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned SLAIN2, which they designated
KIAA1458. The deduced protein contains 612 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected moderate to high expression in all tissues and specific adult
brain regions examined. Highest expression was in adult liver, testis,
and ovary, and lowest expression was in adult pancreas and spleen and in
fetal brain.

By searching databases for genes similar to SLAIN1 (610491), Hirst et
al. (2006) identified mouse and human SLAIN2. The deduced mouse and
human proteins have 581 amino acids, contain serine-rich domains, and
share 93.8% identity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hirst et al. (2006) determined that the human SLAIN2 gene contains 8
exons and spans 75 kb. The mouse Slain2 gene has a similar structure.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the SLAIN2
gene to chromosome 4. By genomic sequence analysis, Hirst et al. (2006)
mapped the SLAIN2 gene to chromosome 4. They mapped the mouse Slain1
gene to a syntenic region of chromosome 5.

601988	TITLE *601988 LIM DOMAIN KINASE 2; LIMK2
DESCRIPTION Okano et al. (1995) isolated a human cDNA encoding LIMK2, a second
member of the LIMK family, with a domain structure similar to LIMK1
(601329) and 50% overall amino acid identity with LIMK1. They also
identified 2 alternative transcripts, LIMK2a and LIMK2b, which are
probably due to variation in transcriptional initiation. The 3.7-kb
LIMK2 mRNA was detected in all tissues tested, with the highest level in
placenta and a moderate level in liver, lung, kidney, and pancreas,
whereas the 1.6-kb mRNA was detected only in skeletal muscle and heart.
The 3.7-kb transcript was detected in lung, stomach, and renal cancer
cell lines. Osada et al. (1996) found that LIMK2a transcripts were more
abundant than LIMK2b in liver, colon, stomach, and spleen, while in
brain, kidney, and placenta LIMK2b transcripts were the dominant form.
The former encodes a protein containing 2 LIM domains, a PDZ domain, and
a kinase domain, while the latter has only 1.5 LIM domains. (The LIM
domain is thought to be involved in protein-protein interactions; the
PDZ domain was originally recognized in a family of proteins related to
the Drosophila lethal discs-large tumor suppressor gene product Dlga
(see 601014) and was shown to function in protein-protein interactions
targeting the protein to the submembranous compartment.) Transfection
studies have shown an association of 63-kD and 58-kD proteins with the
LIMK2a and LIMK2b proteins. The former is distributed in the cytoplasm
and nucleus and the latter occurs mainly in the cytoplasm. A truncated
LIMK2-kinase has a nuclear location, not showing the protein
association. Okano et al. (1995) demonstrated the
serine/threonine-specific kinase activity of LIMK1 and LIMK2 by in vitro
analysis.

Maekawa et al. (1999) demonstrated that LIM kinase is phosphorylated and
activated by ROCK (601702), a downstream effector of Rho, and that LIM
kinase, in turn, phosphorylates cofilin (601442), inhibiting its
actin-depolymerizing activity. They concluded that this pathway
contributes to Rho-induced reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton.

601767	TITLE *601767 HUNTINGTIN-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1; HIP1
HIP1/PDGFRB FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The HIP1 gene encodes huntingtin interacting protein-1, which is an
endocytic protein that colocalizes with the adaptor complex AP2 (see,
e.g., AP2A1; 601026) and clathrin to play a role in endocytosis at the
plasma membrane of various cells (summary by Metzler et al., 2003).

CLONING

Huntington disease (HD; 143100) may be due to a toxic gain-of-function
caused by abnormal protein-protein interactions related to the elongated
polyglutamine sequence of huntingtin (HTT: 613004). Thus, the binding of
distinct proteins to the polyglutamine region could either confer a new
property on huntingtin or alter its normal interactions with other
proteins. Wanker et al. (1997) hypothesized that the specific binding of
a protein with a restricted pattern of expression to the elongated
polyglutamine stretch of the huntingtin protein could cause selective
vulnerability to particular cells. The potential huntingtin-interacting
proteins that have been identified include huntingtin-associated
protein-1 (600947), the glycolytic enzyme GAPD (138400), and the
ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2-25K, also named HIP2 (602846), which
binds selectively to the N terminus of huntingtin. Wanker et al. (1997)
demonstrated the specific binding of a protein to the N terminus of
huntingtin, both in the yeast 2-hybrid screen and in in vitro binding
experiments. A protein region downstream of the polyglutamine stretch in
huntingtin was essential for the interaction in vitro. Thus, the authors
designated the new protein 'huntingtin-interacting protein-1' (HIP1).
The HIP1 cDNA isolated by the 2-hybrid screen encodes a 55-kD fragment
of the novel protein. Using an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody
raised against recombinant HIP1, a protein of 116 kD was detected in
brain extracts by Western blot analysis. The predicted amino acid
sequence of the HIP1 fragment exhibited significant similarity to
cytoskeleton proteins, suggesting to Wanker et al. (1997) that HIP1 and
huntingtin play a functional role in the cell filament network. The HIP1
gene was found to be ubiquitously expressed at low levels in different
brain regions. HIP1 is enriched in human brain but can also be detected
in other human tissues, as well as in mouse brain. The authors noted
that HIP1 and huntingtin behave almost identically during subcellular
fractionation and both proteins are enriched in the membrane-containing
fractions.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chopra et al. (2000) determined that the HIP1 gene contains 32 exons
spanning approximately 215 kb of genomic DNA and gives rise to 2
alternative splice forms, termed HIP1-1 and HIP1-2, which differ in
their 5-prime sequence. HIP1-1 encodes a deduced 1,034-amino acid
protein, and HIP1-2 a deduced 1,003-amino acid protein.

MAPPING

To confirm the localization of HIP1 to the same region as
Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS; 194050), Wedemeyer et al. (1997) mapped
ELN and HIP1 in a radiation hybrid (RH) panel. HIP1 was found to be
located 2.03 cR proximal to elastin (ELN; 130160) in the RH mapping
panel; the calculated distance between the 2 loci was 200 to 400 kb.
Although this suggested that the HIP1 locus is within the region of WBS
deletion, this was found not to be the case when somatic cell hybrids in
which the deleted and nondeleted chromosome 7 from a typical Williams
syndrome patient had been separated were typed.

Kalchman et al. (1997) assigned the HIP1 gene to human chromosome 7q11.2
by FISH. By radiation hybrid analysis, Wedemeyer et al. (1997) mapped
the HIP1 gene to 17q11.23. Himmelbauer et al. (1998) mapped the mouse
Hip1 gene to chromosome 5.

GENE FUNCTION

Kalchman et al. (1997) showed that HIP1 is a membrane-associated protein
that colocalizes with huntingtin and shares sequence homology and
biochemical characteristics with Sla2p, a protein essential for function
of the cytoskeleton in S. cerevisiae. The huntingtin-HIP1 interaction
was restricted to the brain and correlated inversely with the
polyglutamine length in huntingtin. Their results provided a molecular
link between huntingtin and the neuronal cytoskeleton and suggested
that, in Huntington disease, loss of normal huntingtin-HIP1 interaction
may contribute to a defect in membrane-cytoskeletal integrity in the
brain.

Hackam et al. (2000) found that overexpression of HIP1 in a human
neuronal precursor cell line resulted in caspase-3 (600636)-dependent
activation of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. They identified a domain
within HIP1 that showed homology to the death effector domain (DED)
found in proteins involved in apoptosis. Expression of the HIP1 DED
domain alone resulted in cell death indistinguishable from that induced
by full-length HIP1. The substitution of a conserved phenylalanine
within the DED domain eliminated HIP1 toxicity.

Waelter et al. (2001) identified 3 HIP1-associated proteins, clathrin
heavy chain (CLTC; 118955) and alpha-adaptin A and C (AP2A1; 601026). In
vitro binding studies revealed that the central coiled-coil domain is
required for the interaction of HIP1 with clathrin, whereas DPF-like
motifs located upstream to this domain are important for the binding of
HIP1 to the C-terminal 'appendage' domain of alpha-adaptin A and C.
Expression of full-length HIP1 in mammalian cells resulted in a punctate
cytoplasmic immunostaining characteristic of clathrin-coated vesicles.
In contrast, when a truncated HIP1 protein containing both the DPF-like
motifs and the coiled-coil domain was overexpressed, large perinuclear
vesicle-like structures containing HIP1, huntingtin, clathrin, and
endocytosed transferrin were observed, suggesting that HIP1 is an
endocytic protein, the structural integrity of which may be crucial for
maintenance of normal vesicle size in vivo.

Gervais et al. (2002) found that HIP1 binds to the HIP1 protein
interactor (HIPPI; 606621), which has partial sequence homology to HIP1
and similar tissue and subcellular distribution. The availability of
free HIP1 is modulated by polyglutamine length within huntingtin, with
disease-associated polyglutamine expansion favoring the formation of
proapoptotic HIPPI-HIP1 heterodimers. This heterodimer can recruit
procaspase-8 (601763) into a complex of HIPPI, HIP1, and procaspase-8,
and launch apoptosis through components of the extrinsic cell death
pathway. Gervais et al. (2002) proposed that huntingtin polyglutamine
expansion liberates HIP1 so that it can form a caspase-8 recruitment
complex with HIPPI, possibly contributing to neuronal death in
Huntington disease.

Rao et al. (2002) found that HIP1 is expressed in prostate and colon
tumor cells, but not in corresponding benign epithelia. They
investigated the relationship between HIP1 expression in primary
prostate cancer and clinical outcomes with tissue microarrays. HIP1
expression was significantly associated with prostate cancer progression
and metastasis. Conversely, primary prostate cancers lacking HIP1
expression consistently showed no progression after radical
prostatectomy. In addition, the expression of HIP1 was elevated in
prostate tumors from the transgenic mouse model of prostate cancer. At
the molecular level, expression of a dominant-negative mutant of HIP1
led to caspase-9 (602234)-dependent apoptosis, suggesting that HIP1 is a
cellular survival factor. Thus, HIP1 may play a role in tumorigenesis by
allowing the survival of precancerous or cancerous cells. HIP1 might
accomplish this via regulation of clathrin-mediated trafficking, a
fundamental cellular pathway that had not theretofore been associated
with tumorigenesis. HIP1 represents a putative prognostic factor for
prostate cancer and a potential therapy target in prostate as well as
colon cancers.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a patient with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML; see 607785)
with a t(5;7)(q33;q11.2) translocation, Ross et al. (1998) found fusion
of the HIP1 gene to the platelet-derived growth factor-beta receptor
gene (PDGFRB; 173410). They identified a chimeric transcript containing
the HIP1 gene located at 7q11.2 fused to the PDGFRB gene on 5q33. The
fusion gene encoded amino acids 1 to 950 of HIP1 joined in-frame to the
transmembrane and tyrosine kinase domains of the PDGFRB gene. The
reciprocal PDGFRB/HIP1 transcript was not expressed. The fusion protein
product was a 180-kD protein when expressed in a murine hematopoietic
cell line and was constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated. Furthermore,
the fusion gene transformed the same mouse hematopoietic cell line to
interleukin-3-independent growth.

ANIMAL MODEL

Metzler et al. (2003) found that Hip1-null mice showed failure to thrive
and developed a neurologic phenotype by 3 months of age manifest as
tremor and gait ataxia secondary to a rigid thoracolumbar kyphosis. The
phenotype was progressive, resulting in premature death. The defect did
not result from anomalies of the skeleton, muscle, or neuromuscular
junction, and there were no morphologic changes in the central nervous
system. Liposomal membranes isolated from mutant mouse brains showed
decreased assembly of endocytic protein complexes, likely resulting in
impaired clathrin vesicle formation. Primary neurons from wildtype mice
showed Hip1 immunostaining in dendrites and cell bodies, suggesting Hip1
involvement in postsynaptic endocytic events. Following AMPA
stimulation, Hip1 colocalized with GluR1 (138248)-containing AMPA
receptors and became concentrated in cell bodies, indicating its role in
receptor trafficking. Neurons from the Hip1-null mice showed
significantly impaired clathrin-mediated internalization of
GluR1-containing AMPA receptors. The findings indicated that HIP1
regulates AMPA receptor trafficking in the central nervous system via
its function in clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

Oravecz-Wilson et al. (2004) reported that 3 different mutations of
murine Hip1 lead to hematopoietic abnormalities, reflected by diminished
early progenitor frequencies and resistance to 5-FU-induced bone marrow
toxicity. Two of the Hip1 mutant lines also displayed the spinal
defects, including kypholordosis, described by Metzler et al. (2003).
The authors concluded that, in addition to being required for the
survival/proliferation of cancer cells and germline progenitors, HIP1 is
also required for the survival/proliferation of diverse types of somatic
cells, including hematopoietic progenitors.

Bradley et al. (2007) found that Hip1/Hip1r (605613) double-knockout
mice were dwarfed, had severe vertebral defects, and died in early
adulthood. However, these phenotypes were not observed in single Hip1-
or Hip1r-null mice, suggesting that the 2 genes can compensate for one
another. Studies did not show abnormalities in endocrine function or
growth factor receptors. Embryonic fibroblasts from Hip1/Hip1r
double-knockout mice showed delayed growth and delayed progression
through the cell cycle, but no increase in apoptosis. Expression of
human HIP1 rescued many aspects of the double-knockout phenotype,
suggesting that the human and mouse proteins share some functions.

Komoike et al. (2010) identified and cloned the zebrafish Hip1 gene.
Knockdown of the gene resulted in absence of yolk extension, a narrow
body along the dorsoventral axis, and mandibular hypoplasia, but no
other significant abnormalities were noted.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The HARS2 gene encodes a histidyl tRNA synthetase, a highly conserved
protein that functions in mitochondria (summary by Pierce et al., 2011).

CLONING

O'Hanlon et al. (1995) identified the HARS2 gene, which they called HO3,
oriented head-to-head with the HARS gene (142810). The deduced 506-amino
acid HO3 protein has a calculated molecular mass of 56.9 kD. HO3 shares
72% amino acid identity with HARS. Both proteins contain 3 motifs
conserved among class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and 2 signature
regions of histidyl-tRNA synthetases. However, HARS and HARS2 have
divergent N-terminal domains that are encoded by the first 2 exons of
each gene. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.5-kb HO3 transcript that
was highly expressed in heart, skeletal muscle, and kidney, with lower
expression in brain and liver.

Using 5-prime RACE with a human kidney cDNA library, O'Hanlon and Miller
(2002) identified several HARSL transcripts that differed only in the
lengths of their 5-prime UTRs. They also identified HARSL transcripts
containing an alternatively spliced 91-bp exon within their 5-prime
UTRs. O'Hanlon and Miller (2002) reported that the mouse and human HARSL
proteins share 83.9% amino acid identity. They noted that the HARSL
protein lacks 60 N-terminal amino acids found in HARS that are necessary
for enzymatic activity, suggesting that HARSL may not function as a tRNA
synthetase.

By searching databases for aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases containing a
mitochondrial targeting sequence, Bonnefond et al. (2005) identified
HARS2, which the called mitochondrial HISRS. The deduced 506-amino acid
protein has an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal with a
predicted cleavage site after residue 34. HARS2 has characteristics of a
class II mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase and is expected to
function as a dimer.

Pierce et al. (2011) found high expression of the HARS2 gene in the
mitochondria of mammalian cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

O'Hanlon and Miller (2002) determined that the HARS2 gene contains 13
exons and spans about 7.9 kb. The HARS and HARS2 genes share a
bidirectional promoter that lacks TATA and CAAT boxes. Both genes use
multiple transcriptional start sites.

Bonnefond et al. (2005) reported that the HARS2 gene contains 13 exons
and spans 6.9 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, O'Hanlon et al. (1995) mapped the HARS2
gene to chromosome 5, where it is oriented head-to-head with the HARS
gene.

O'Hanlon and Miller (2002) mapped the HARS and HARS2 genes to chromosome
5q31.3 by genomic sequence analysis. The ORFs of HARS and HARS2 are
separated by 344 bp.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of a family of European descent with Perrault
syndrome-2 (PRLTS2; 614926) originally reported by Pallister and Opitz
(1979), Pierce et al. (2011) identified compound heterozygosity for 2
mutations in the HARS2 gene (600783.0001 and 600783.0002). The
mutations, which were found by linkage analysis followed by candidate
gene sequencing, were shown to cause decreased enzyme activity. Affected
females had sensorineural deafness, primary amenorrhea, streak gonads,
and infertility, whereas affected males had deafness, normal pubertal
development, and were fertile.

ANIMAL MODEL

Pierce et al. (2011) demonstrated that 50% knockdown of the Hars1 gene
in C. elegans resulted in severe gonadal defects, including smaller,
narrower gonads and absence of oocytes or fertilized eggs in the
majority of animals. The animals were almost completely sterile. The
loss of fertility apparently resulted from increased apoptosis of germ
cells. Complete knockdown of the Hars1 gene resulted in arrested
development at the L2 larvae stage.

PERRAULT SYNDROME 2
HARS2, LEU200VAL

In affected members of a family of European descent with Perrault
syndrome-2 (PRLTS2; 614926) originally reported by Pallister and Opitz
(1979), Pierce et al. (2011) identified compound heterozygosity for 2
mutations in the HARS2 gene: a paternally inherited 598C-G transversion
in exon 6 resulting in a leu200-to-val (L200V) substitution in a highly
conserved residue, and a maternally inherited 1102G-T transversion in
exon 10 resulting in a val368-to-leu (V368L; 600783.0002) substitution
in a highly conserved residue. The mutations were found by linkage
analysis followed by candidate gene sequencing. Neither mutation was
found in 1,942 control individuals. Study of patient lymphoblasts showed
that the 598C-G mutation also created an alternative splice site,
resulting in an in-frame deletion of 12 codons in exon 6 (delta200-211).
The deletion transcript was present at much lower levels in the
unaffected father compared to the affected children. Both mutant
missense proteins were expressed, could dimerize, and localized to the
mitochondria in mammalian cells, but the deletion transcript was poorly
expressed, suggesting that it is unstable. Both missense mutations had
significantly decreased enzymatic activity compared to wildtype, with
the V368L mutation showing a more severe effect. Modeling of the
homologous mutations in yeast also indicated that the V368L mutant had a
more severe effect on enzyme activity. Based on the functions of
mitochondrial tRNA synthetases and cellular defects resulting from their
mutation, Pierce et al. (2011) speculated that mutations in HARS2 result
in decreased mitochondrial translation and respiratory chain defects in
affected tissues.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

LIPH is a phosphatidic acid-selective phospholipase A1 (PLA1) that
produces 2-acyl lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). LPA is a lipid mediator
with diverse biologic properties, including induction of platelet
aggregation, smooth muscle contraction, and stimulation of cell
proliferation (summary by Sonoda et al., 2002).

CLONING

Sonoda et al. (2002) identified LIPH, which they called MPAPLA1, by
searching an EST database using the rat phosphatidylserine-selective
PLA1 (Pspla1) sequence. They cloned the full-length cDNA by RT-PCR using
colon total RNA. The deduced 451-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of about 51 kD. LIPH has an N-terminal signal sequence
followed by a catalytic domain containing the putative catalytic triad
ser154, asp178, and his249. LIPH also has a 12-residue lid region, which
likely covers a catalytic pocket, and 4 potential N-linked glycosylation
sites. LIPH shares about 34% identity with human PSPLA1. Northern blot
analysis revealed a transcript of 3.3 kb in most tissues examined, with
transcripts of 4.4, 2.2, and 1.5 kb also detected in some tissues.
Highest expression was in prostate, testis, ovary, colon, pancreas,
kidney, and lung. Lower levels were detected in spleen, brain, and
heart. Northern and Western blot analyses showed a high level of mRNA
and protein expression in platelets. The protein had an apparent
molecular mass of 55 kD. Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy of
transfected Sf9 cells indicated that the protein is localized
exclusively to the plasma membrane.

Jin et al. (2002) identified LIPH by searching an EST database using
LIPG (603684) as the query. Their analysis indicated that ser144 rather
than ser154, as suggested by Sonoda et al. (2002), is part of the
catalytic triad. They found that LIPH shares 47% amino acid identity
with PSPLA1 and about 85% identity with mouse Liph. RT-PCR revealed
strong expression of LIPH in testis, colon, pancreas, and lung, and
weaker expression in small intestine, mammary gland, ovary, brain, and
varicose vein. RT-PCR of mouse tissues gave similar results. Northern
blot analysis of several human cell lines revealed transcripts of 4.3
and 3.6 kb. In situ hybridization of mouse embryos revealed expression
in the enterocytes of intestine. Transfection of HEK293 cells resulted
in secretion of a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 63 kD.

Shimomura et al. (2009) performed in situ hybridization studies in human
scalp skin sections and found that in the bulb portion of the hair
follicle, LIPH mRNA was strongly expressed in the precortex, hair shaft
cuticle, and the Huxley layer of the inner root sheath. In the upper
portion of the hair follicle, the signals within the outer root sheath
became prominent. LIPH was also expressed in the sebaceous gland and the
suprabasal layers of the human epidermis.

GENE FUNCTION

Sonoda et al. (2002) found that LIPH expressed on the surface of
transfected Sf9 insect cells was inactive against phospholipid
substrates. However, the culture medium from cells expressing the enzyme
could activate EDG7 (605106), a cellular receptor for 2-acetyl LPA.
Activity was further enhanced when cells were treated with phorbol ester
or with a bacterial phospholipase D (see 602515).

GENE STRUCTURE

Jin et al. (2002) determined the LIPH gene contains 10 exons and spans
about 45 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Jin et al. (2002) mapped the LIPH gene to
chromosome 3q27-q28. Kazantseva et al. (2006) identified the LIPH gene
within a 350-kb region on chromosome 3q27 centromeric to marker D3S1530.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 14 Mari families and 36 Chuvash families from the
Volga-Ural region of Russia with autosomal recessive hypotrichosis
(LAH2; 604379) mapping to chromosome 3q26-q27, Kazantseva et al. (2006)
identified homozygosity for an approximately 985-bp deletion that
eliminated exon 4 of the LIPH gene and its flanking intronic sequences
(607365.0001). The authors predicted that the deletion was the result of
unequal recombination between copies of Alu retrotransposons flanking
exon 4. Deletion of exon 4 does not alter the reading frame of the LIPH
gene; however, it does delete a highly conserved domain containing
evolutionarily invariant amino acid residues, including the critical
asp178 residue of a putative catalytic triad conserved in lipases.

In 3 sibs, born of consanguineous Pakistani parents, with autosomal
recessive hypotrichosis, Ali et al. (2007) identified a homozygous
mutation in the LIPH gene (607365.0002).

Shimomura et al. (2009) directly sequenced the LIPH gene in 11
consanguineous Pakistani families with woolly hair (ARWH2; see 604379)
and/or hypotrichosis that were negative for mutation in the P2RY5 gene
(609239), and identified 5 different homozygous mutations among all 11
families (see, e.g., 607365.0003-607365.0005).

In 2 large unrelated consanguineous Pakistani families with woolly
hair/hypotrichosis showing linkage to the LIPH gene in which
microsatellite marker analysis demonstrated segregation of 2 distinct
disease alleles within each family, Petukhova et al. (2009) identified 2
different LIPH mutations: a known 2-bp deletion (607365.0003) and a
novel 90-bp duplication (607365.0006). Affected individuals were either
homozygous for the deletion or the duplication, or compound heterozygous
for both; unaffected individuals either had no mutation or carried 1 of
the mutations in heterozygous state. Petukhova et al. (2009) noted that
the 2 families in this study originated from different provinces in
Pakistan, separated by approximately 1,100 km and a river that serves as
a geographic barrier; in addition, the 2 families belonged to different
tribes and spoke distinct languages. The families likely had no common
ancestors for at least 150 years, suggesting that these mutations arose
more than 6 generations ago.

In probands from 3 Japanese families, who were born with tightly curled
hair and developed hypotrichosis in the second year of life, Shimomura
et al. (2009) identified homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for 2
missense mutations in the LIPH gene (607365.0007, 607365.0008). The
authors stated that this was the first report of LIPH mutations in the
Japanese population.

In 9 Pakistani families with the hypotrichosis/woolly hair phenotype
mapping to LIPH, Khan et al. (2011) identified 2 recurrent homozygous
mutations (607365.0003 or 6073665.0005); 4 of the families had features
of hypotrichosis, 3 had features of woolly hair with or without
hypotrichosis, and 2 had a mixed phenotype.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPOTRICHOSIS 7
LIPH, EX4 DEL

In individuals of Mari or Chuvash descent with autosomal recessive
hypotrichosis (604379), Kazantseva et al. (2006) identified homozygous
deletion of exon 4 of the LIPH gene. This occurred due to unequal
recombination between copies of Alu elements flanking exon 4. All
affected individuals tested had homozygous deletion, and all their
parents were heterozygous for the deletion and were unaffected. The
allele frequency was estimated to be 0.033 among the Chuvash and 0.030
among the Mari people, but this mutation was not identified in any other
Finno-Ugric populations.

.0002
HYPOTRICHOSIS 7
LIPH, 5-BP DEL, NT346

In 3 sibs, born of consanguineous Pakistani parents, with autosomal
recessive hypotrichosis (604379), Ali et al. (2007) identified a
homozygous 5-bp deletion (346delATATA) in exon 2 of the LIPH gene,
resulting in a frameshift and premature termination of the protein.

.0003
HYPOTRICHOSIS 7
WOOLLY HAIR, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 2, WITH OR WITHOUT HYPOTRICHOSIS,
INCLUDED
LIPH, 2-BP DEL, 659TA

In affected members of 2 unrelated consanguineous Pakistani families
with autosomal recessive hypotrichosis (604379), Jelani et al. (2008)
identified a homozygous 2-bp deletion (659delTA) in exon 5 of the LIPH
gene, predicted to result in premature termination and nonsense-mediated
mRNA decay. Affected individuals were nearly devoid of normal eyebrows,
eyelashes, axillary hair, and body hair. Adult males had normal beard
hair but sparse scalp hair. There were no other clinical abnormalities.

In affected individuals from 3 consanguineous Pakistani families,
including 1 with woolly hair (ARWH2; see 604379), 1 with woolly hair and
hypotrichosis (WH/HT; see 604379), and 1 with hypotrichosis alone,
Shimomura et al. (2009) identified homozygosity for the 659delTA
mutation in the LIPH gene. The mutation was not found in 100 unrelated
Pakistani controls.

In affected individuals from 2 large unrelated consanguineous Pakistani
families with woolly hair/hypotrichosis, Petukhova et al. (2009)
identified homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for the 659delTA
mutation and a 90-bp duplication (607365.0006) in the LIPH gene.
Affected individuals were either homozygous for the deletion or the
duplication, or compound heterozygous for both; unaffected individuals
either had no mutation or carried 1 of the mutations in heterozygous
state. The mutation was not found in 100 unrelated Pakistani controls.

In 6 Pakistani families with the hypotrichosis/woolly hair phenotype,
Khan et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for the 659delTA mutation in
the LIPH gene. Affected members from 3 of the families had features of
hypotrichosis, whereas in 2 of the families they had sparse, woolly
scalp hair with sparse to absent hair on the remainder of the body; in
the remaining family, the phenotype was mixed, with some affected
members exhibiting features of hypotrichosis and others having woolly
scalp hair. Haplotype analysis in these families, which belonged to
different ethnic groups from various regions of Pakistan, suggested that
the 2-bp deletion was a founder mutation.

.0004
WOOLLY HAIR, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 2, WITH OR WITHOUT HYPOTRICHOSIS
HYPOTRICHOSIS 7, INCLUDED
LIPH, EXONS 7-8 DEL

In affected members of 5 consanguineous Pakistani families, including 2
families with woolly hair (ARWH2; see 604379), 2 with hypotrichosis
(LAH2; 604379), and 1 with woolly hair and hypotrichosis (WH/HT; see
604379), Shimomura et al. (2009) identified homozygosity for a 5,290-bp
deletion encompassing exons 7 and 8 of the LIPH gene, predicted to
result in a frameshift and premature termination codon. The same
disease-related haplotype was detected in all 5 families, indicating a
founder chromosome for the deletion, which was not present in 100
unrelated Pakistani controls.

.0005
WOOLLY HAIR, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 2, WITH OR WITHOUT HYPOTRICHOSIS
LIPH, TRP108ARG

In affected members of a large consanguineous Pakistani family with
woolly hair (ARWH2; see 604379), Shimomura et al. (2009) identified
homozygosity for a 322T-C transition in exon 2 of the LIPH gene,
resulting in a trp108-to-arg (W108R) substitution at a highly conserved
residue within the N-terminal catalytic domain, predicted to cause
protein misfolding and production of an inactive enzyme. The mutation
was not found in 100 unrelated Pakistani controls.

In 3 Pakistani families with the hypotrichosis/woolly hair phenotype,
Khan et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for the W108R mutation in the
LIPH gene. Affected members from 1 of the families had features of
hypotrichosis; in another family they had sparse, woolly scalp hair with
sparse to absent hair on the remainder of the body; and in the third
family, the phenotype was mixed, with some affected members exhibiting
features of hypotrichosis and others having woolly scalp hair.

.0006
WOOLLY HAIR, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 2, WITH OR WITHOUT HYPOTRICHOSIS
LIPH, 90-BP DUP, NT280

In affected individuals from 2 large unrelated consanguineous Pakistani
families with woolly hair/hypotrichosis (see 604379), Petukhova et al.
(2009) identified homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for a 90-bp
tandem duplication of the sequence between positions 280 and 369 in the
LIPH gene, resulting in an in-frame 30-amino acid insertion in the
N-terminal catalytic domain, and the known 659delTA mutation
(607365.0003). Affected individuals were either homozygous for the
duplication or the deletion, or compound heterozygous for both;
unaffected individuals either had no mutation or carried 1 of the
mutations in heterozygous state. The mutation was not found in 100
unrelated Pakistani controls.

.0007
WOOLLY HAIR, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 2, WITH OR WITHOUT HYPOTRICHOSIS
LIPH, CYS246SER

In 2 female probands, 3 years and 4 years of age, respectively, from 2
Japanese families with woolly hair and hypotrichosis (see 609239),
Shimomura et al. (2009) identified homozygosity for a 736T-A
transversion in exon 6 of the LIPH gene, resulting in a cys246-to-ser
(C246S) substitution at a highly conserved residue that is considered
critical for the formation of a disulfide bond. In an unrelated
4-year-old Japanese boy with woolly hair and hypotrichosis, Shimomura et
al. (2009) identified compound heterozygosity for the C246S mutation and
a 742C-A transversion in exon 6 of LIPH, resulting in a his248-to-asn
(H248N; 607365.0008) substitution, involving 1 of 3 highly conserved
catalytic residues. The unaffected parents of both girls were
heterozygous for the C246S mutation; no DNA was available from the boy's
parents. Neither mutation was found in 100 unrelated Japanese controls.

611285	TITLE *611285 POTASSIUM CHANNEL TETRAMERIZATION DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 5; KCTD5
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Weger et al.
(2007) identified a novel cDNA, designated KCTD5, encoding a deduced
234-amino acid protein that interacts with the large regulatory proteins
Rep78 and Rep68 of adeno-associated virus-2 (AAV-2). KCTD5 contains an
N-terminal voltage-gated potassium channel tetramerization domain (T1).
The Rep68 and Rep78 proteins are essential for AAV-2 DNA replication and
regulation of AAV expression when helper virus is present (e.g.,
adenovirus). They are ATP-dependent helicases with site and
strand-specific endonuclease activities, as well as sequence-specific
DNA-binding proteins that are responsible for site-specific integration
of AAV-2 on chromosome 19. Expression of Rep78/Rep68 can also inhibit
HIV-1 production.

GENE FUNCTION

Using coimmunoprecipitation experiments, Weger et al. (2007) confirmed
KCTD5 interaction with Rep68/Rep78 proteins. Using deletion mutant
experiments, they showed that this interaction required part of the
N-terminal DNA-binding domain and the region surrounding the nuclear
localization signal of Rep68 and the T1 tetramerization domain and
C-terminal amino acids 204-234 of KCTD5. Immunofluorescence experiments
showed that, in the absence of Rep protein expression, KCTD5 was located
almost exclusively in the cytoplasm; upon expression of Rep78 or Rep68,
KCTD5 was found predominantly in the nucleus. KCTD5 overexpression
completely abrogated Rep68-mediated posttranscriptional activation of an
HIV-LTR-driven luciferase reporter gene. Weger et al. (2007) concluded
that KCTD5, by binding the Rep68/Rep78 proteins, is a potential
regulator of the AAV life cycle in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm of
infected cells.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the KCTD5
gene to chromosome 16 (TMAP RH66453).

154365	TITLE *154365 PROTEASOME 26S SUBUNIT, ATPase, 2; PSMC2
;;MAMMALIAN SUPPRESSOR OF sgv-1 OF YEAST; MSS1;;
PROTEASE 26S, SUBUNIT 7; S7
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The 26S proteasome (see PSMC1; 602706) is a multisubunit protease
complex composed of a 20S core component and two 19S regulatory
complexes. PSMC2 is 1 of 6 putative ATPases contained within the
regulatory complex. PSMC2 was first identified as a possible cellular
factor that cooperates with the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1)
protein Tat, a potent activator of virus gene expression.

CLONING

By transcomplementation of a yeast sgv1-deficient mutant, Shibuya et al.
(1992) isolated a human cDNA from a novel gene, MSS1. The MSS1 protein
was found to share 42% sequence identity with the human TBP1 protein
(PSMC3; 186852), which binds Tat in vitro and suppresses Tat-mediated
transactivation in vivo (Nelbock et al., 1990). Shibuya et al. (1992)
found that the levels of HIV activation by Tat correlated with
endogenous levels of MSS1 mRNA. Furthermore, they provided evidence that
expression of MSS1 enhances the Tat-mediated transactivation. The 1.5-kb
MSS1 cDNA encodes a protein of 433 amino acids.

To characterize components of the 26S proteasome, Dubiel et al. (1993)
performed peptide sequence analysis on subunit 7 (S7). They determined
that S7 is identical to MSS1. By SDS-PAGE, S7 has a molecular mass of 49
kD.

By Western blot analysis of rat tissues, Yanagi et al. (2000) found that
the level of PSMC2 expression varied among tissues but was ubiquitous.
This was in contrast to the expression pattern of the 30-kD component of
the proteasome 20S core, which showed similar levels of expression in
all tissues. Immunolocalization of proteasome subunits in HeLa and HepG2
cells showed proteasome localization within nuclei, while
immunolocalization of PSMC2 gave homogeneous staining of both cytoplasm
and nucleoplasm. By glycerol gradient sedimentation, Yanagi et al.
(2000) found PSMC2 purified from rat liver nuclear extracts associated
with the proteasome and with protein complexes of lighter density, and
it also existed as a monomer. They also found that several basal
transcription factors for RNA polymerase II, including TATA box-binding
protein (TBP; 600075), and the general transcription factors IIB (GFT2B;
189963), IIH (see GTF2H1; 189972), and IIF (see GTF2F1; 189968)
coimmunoprecipitated with PSMC2 from rat liver lysosomes, suggesting
dual functionality of PSMC2.

MAPPING

Tanahashi et al. (1998) mapped the PSMC2 gene to 7q22.1-q22.3 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

602044	TITLE *602044 UNCOUPLING PROTEIN 3; UCP3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Boss et al. (1997) and Vidal-Puig et al. (1997) described the cloning of
UCP3 cDNAs. Both groups derived their clones from human skeletal muscle
libraries, and both reported that UCP3 is approximately 57% and 73%
identical to human UCP1 (113730) and UCP2 (601693), respectively. Boss
et al. (1997) and Solanes et al. (1997) cloned a short isoform of UCP3
(UCP3S) containing 275 amino acids and a long isoform of UCP3 (UCP3L)
containing 312 amino acids. UCP3S contains 3 mitochondrial
energy-transfer-protein domains and 5 putative transmembrane domains,
while UCP3L contains an additional 37 amino acids at its C terminus that
encodes a putative transmembrane domain and a putative purine
nucleotide-binding domain. Solanes et al. (1997) determined that UCP3S
is generated when a cleavage and polyadenylation signal within the last
intron prematurely terminates message elongation. Boss et al. (1997)
used Northern blot analysis to show that in human tissue UCP3 is
expressed as a 2.3-kb message in skeletal muscle and heart. In rat
tissue, UCP3 transcripts were found in heart, brown adipose tissue,
white adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Boss et al. (1997) examined UCP expression in cold-adapted rats and
found that, unlike UCP1, the expression levels of UCP2 and UCP3 were not
affected by cold. Nonetheless, the authors concluded that UCP3 may be
involved in thermogenesis through the uncoupling of oxidative
phosphorylation in skeletal muscle.

Millet et al. (1997) observed an increase in the levels of UCP2 and UCP3
mRNA in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue from both lean and obese
individuals undergoing fasting. They suggested that the increase
indicates a role for these proteins in the metabolic adaptation to
fasting. The similar induction of gene expression observed during
fasting in lean and obese subjects show that there is no major
alteration of UCP2 and UCP3 gene regulation in adipose tissue and
skeletal muscle of obese subjects. UCP2 is widely expressed in human
tissues, whereas UCP3 expression seems to be restricted to skeletal
muscle, an important site of thermogenesis in humans.

With the capacity to participate in thermogenesis and energy balance,
UCP3 is an important obesity candidate gene. Bouchard et al. (1997)
demonstrated linkage between markers at the UCP2/UCP3 region with
resting metabolic rate. This region is syntenic to a region of mouse
chromosome 7 that has been linked to hyperinsulinemia and obesity
(Fleury et al., 1997).

Liu et al. (1998) and Hinz et al. (1999) showed that expression of UCP3
in yeast resulted in reduced cellular growth and a significant decrease
in mitochondria membrane potential. Hinz et al. (1999) found that
cellular respiration coupled to oxidative phosphorylation decreased,
while cellular heat production increased. Liu et al. (1998) found that
adenovirus-mediated leptin (164160) expression in obese ob/ob mice led
to increased expression of Ucp3 in skeletal muscle, as well as
significant weight loss.

UCP1 diverts energy from ATP synthesis to thermogenesis in the
mitochondria of brown adipose by catalyzing a regulated leak of protons
across the inner membrane. UCP2 and UCP3 are present at much lower
abundance than UCP1, and the uncoupling with which they are associated
is not significantly thermogenic. Mild uncoupling would, however,
decrease the mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species, which
are important mediators of oxidative damage. Echtay et al. (2002)
demonstrated that superoxide increases mitochondrial proton conductance
through effects on UCP1, UCP2, and UCP3. Superoxide-induced uncoupling
requires fatty acids and is inhibited by purine nucleotides.
Superoxide-induced uncoupling correlates with the tissue expression of
UCPs and appears in mitochondria from yeast expressing UCP1. Skeletal
muscle mitochondria express only UCP3; therefore superoxide-induced
uncoupling is absent in the skeletal muscle of UCP3 knockout mice.
Echtay et al. (2002) concluded that the interaction of superoxide with
UCPs may be a mechanism for decreasing the concentrations of reactive
oxygen species inside mitochondria.

In 9 healthy male volunteers, Hesselink et al. (2003) measured the
phosphocreatine resynthesis rate following intense anoxic contraction,
which is a sensitive index of in vivo mitochondrial function, after 7
days on a low-fat diet and again after 7 days on a high-fat diet. The
high-fat diet increased UCP3 protein content in muscle by 44% compared
to the low-fat diet, but this increase in UCP3 was not associated with
any changes in the rate of muscle phosphocreatine resynthesis during
conditions of maximal flux through oxidative phosphorylation. Hesselink
et al. (2003) concluded that the primary role of UCP3 in humans is not
uncoupling.

GENE STRUCTURE

Solanes et al. (1997) determined that the UCP3 gene contains 7 exons and
spans about 8.5 kb. The coding sequence uses exons 2 to 7 and spans
about 5.25 kb.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

The observation that UCP3 is increased in situations where fatty acid
entry into the mitochondria may exceed the beta-oxidation capacity
suggested to Russell et al. (2003) that this protein may be involved in
the outward translocation of fatty acid from the mitochondrial matrix.
The authors performed biochemical and molecular tests using muscle from
patients with riboflavin-responsive multiple acylcoenzyme A
dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD; 231680), a lipid storage myopathy
characterized by a decrease in fatty acid beta-oxidation capacity. The
results demonstrated decreases in fatty acid beta-oxidation and in the
activities of respiratory chain complexes I (see 157655) and II (see
600857), associated with increases of 3.1- and 1.7-fold in UCP3 mRNA and
protein expression, respectively. The authors postulated that
upregulation of UCP3 in MADD is due to the accumulation of muscle fatty
acid/acylCoA. The authors considered MADD an optimal model to study the
hypothesis that UCP3 is involved in the outward translocation of an
excess of fatty acid from the mitochondria and to show that, in humans,
the effects of fatty acid on UCP3 expression are direct and independent
of fatty acid beta-oxidation.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis and PCR of P1 and BAC genomic clones,
Solanes et al. (1997) mapped the UCP3 gene to chromosome 11q13, adjacent
to the UCP2 gene. Walder et al. (1998) pointed out that the UCP2 and
UCP3 genes constitute a cluster that maps to 11q13. Boss et al. (1998)
described the genomic structure of the UCP3 gene and mapped the gene to
11q13 by somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid analysis. Pecqueur et
al. (1999) determined that the UCP2 gene is located 7 kb downstream of
the UCP3 gene.

By PCR of mouse P1 and BAC clones, Solanes et al. (1997) mapped the
mouse Ucp3 and Ucp2 genes to chromosome 7.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Argyropoulos et al. (1998) identified a missense polymorphism in exon 3
(V102I; 602044.0001) of the UCP3 gene. A mutation introducing a stop
codon in exon 4 (R143X; 602044.0002) and a terminal polymorphism in the
splice donor junction of exon 6 (602044.0003) were also identified in an
individual who was morbidly obese and diabetic. Allele frequencies of
the exon 3 and exon 6 splice junction polymorphisms were determined and
found to be similar in Gullah-speaking African Americans and the Mende
tribe of Sierra Leone, but absent in Caucasians. Moreover, in exon 6
splice donor heterozygotes, basal fat oxidation rates were reduced by
50%, and the respiratory quotient was markedly increased compared with
wildtype individuals, implicating a role for UCP3 in metabolic fuel
partitioning.

Brown et al. (1999) found that expression of native human UCP3 mutations
in yeast showed complete loss (R70W; 602044.0004), significant reduction
(R143X; 602044.0002), or no effect (V102I; 602044.0001 and +1G-A;
602044.0003) on the uncoupling activity of UCP3. The authors concluded
that certain mutations in UCP3 alter its functional impact on membrane
potential, possibly conferring susceptibility to metabolic diseases.

Dalgaard et al. (2001) tested whether variation of the UCP3 promoter is
associated with either juvenile or maturity-onset obesity or body weight
change over a 26-year follow-up among Danish subjects. Mutation
screening of approximately 1 kb 5-prime upstream of the UCP3 gene
revealed a C-to-T variant at -55 (dbSNP rs1800849). The frequency of
this polymorphism was evaluated by restriction fragment length
polymorphism analysis in 4 groups: 1) a group of 744 obese Danish men
who at the draft board examinations had a BMI of at least 31 kg/m2; 2) a
randomly selected control group consisting of 857 draftees; 3) 258
middle-aged subjects; and 4) 409 sixty-year-old subjects. The frequency
of the T allele was 26.0% among the obese draftees and 26.9% in the
control group. The authors concluded that this variant does not play a
major role in the development of common obesity among Danish subjects.

ANIMAL MODEL

Clapham et al. (2000) created transgenic mice that overexpress human
UCP3 in skeletal muscle. UCP3 expression was driven by the human
alpha-skeletal actin (102610) promoter, limiting expression to skeletal
muscle. Clapham et al. (2000) bred 3 independent lines to homozygosity
and selected a line of mice that had a 66-fold increase in UCP3
expression. These mice were hyperphagic but weighed less than their
wildtype littermates. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a striking
reduction in adipose tissue mass. The mice also exhibited lower fasting
plasma glucose and insulin levels and an increased glucose clearance
rate. Clapham et al. (2000) concluded that their data provided evidence
that skeletal muscle UCP3 has the potential to influence metabolic rates
and glucose homeostasis in the whole animal. Choi et al. (2007) showed
that transgenic mice that overexpress human UCP3 in skeletal muscle were
completely protected against the fat-induced defects and insulin
resistance developed in wildtype mice fed a high-fat diet. Protection
was associated with a lower membrane-to-cytosolic ratio of
diacylglycerol and reduced PKC-theta (600448) activity.

Uncoupling protein-3 is a mitochondrial protein that can diminish the
mitochondrial membrane potential. Levels of muscle UCP3 mRNA are
increased by thyroid hormone and fasting. Gong et al. (2000) produced
Ucp3 knockout mice to test the hypothesis that UCP3 influences metabolic
efficiency and is a candidate obesity gene. The Ucp3 -/- mice had no
detectable immunoreactive UCP3 by Western blot analysis. In mitochondria
from the knockout mice, proton leak was greatly reduced in muscle,
minimally reduced in brown fat, and not reduced at all in liver. These
data suggested that UCP3 accounts for much of the proton leak in
skeletal muscle. Despite the lack of UCP3, no consistent phenotypic
abnormality was observed in the mice. They were not obese and had normal
serum insulin, triglyceride, and leptin levels, with a tendency toward
reduced free fatty acids and glucose. Knockout mice showed a normal
circadian rhythm in body temperature and motor activity and had normal
body temperature responses to fasting, stress, thyroid hormone, and cold
exposure. The baseline metabolic rate and respiratory exchange ratio
were the same in knockout and control mice, as were the effects of
fasting, a beta-3 adrenergic agonist, and thyroid hormone on these
parameters. The phenotype of Ucp1/Ucp3 double knockout mice was
indistinguishable from Ucp1 single knockout mice. The data suggested
that Ucp3 is not a major determinant of metabolic rate but, rather, has
other functions.

In Ucp3 knockout mice, Vidal-Puig et al. (2000) found that skeletal
muscle mitochondria lacking Ucp3 are more coupled (i.e., increased state
3/state 4 ratio), indicating that Ucp3 has uncoupling activity. In
addition, production of reactive oxygen species was increased in
mitochondria lacking Ucp3. Despite these effects on mitochondrial
function, Ucp3 did not seem to be required for body weight regulation,
exercise tolerance, fatty acid oxidation, or cold-induced thermogenesis.

Mills et al. (2003) found that mice deficient in Ucp3 have a diminished
thermogenic response to the drug MDMA, also known as 'ecstasy,' and did
not die from a dose of 40 mg kg(-1), which killed 30% of wildtype
littermates. Although the baseline temperature of Ucp3 -/- mice was
indistinguishable from that of wildtype animals, Ucp3-deficient mice
showed a significantly blunted rise in both skeletal muscle and rectal
temperature following MDMA administration. Mills et al. (2003) concluded
that UCP3 is important in MDMA-induced hyperthermia.

UCP3 POLYMORPHISM G/A
OBESITY, SEVERE, AND TYPE II DIABETES
UCP3, 304G-A, VAL102ILE

In a Gullah-speaking African American woman with severe obesity (601665)
and type II diabetes (125853), Argyropoulos et al. (1998) found
heterozygosity for a val102-to-ile (V102I) mutation of the UCP3 gene,
located in the first cytosol-oriented extramembranous loop. Three
overweight children in this family were found to be homozygous for the
V102I polymorphism. The fourth child, a 9-year-old male with a body mass
index (BMI) of 18.5, was heterozygous for the V102I polymorphism. No
paternal sample was available but the father was presumed to be at least
heterozygous for the V102I polymorphism. The polymorphism was not found
in genomic DNA from 128 Caucasian Americans. However, examination of 280
African Americans revealed that 4% of individuals were homozygous and
28% heterozygous for the polymorphism. In the Mende tribe in Sierra
Leone, 3% of the population was found to be homozygous A/A and 21%
heterozygous G/A.

OBESITY, SEVERE, AND TYPE II DIABETES
UCP3, ARG143TER

In a 16-year-old with morbid obesity (601665) (BMI = 51.8) and type II
diabetes (125853), Argyropoulos et al. (1998) found compound
heterozygosity for a 427C-T transition in exon 4, resulting in the
introduction of a premature stop codon at residue 143, arg143 to ter
(R143X), in the third, matrix-oriented loop. In addition, the patient
was heterozygous for a guanine to adenine polymorphism at the splice
donor site of exon 6 (Ggt-Gat), resulting in loss of the splice junction
and premature termination of the protein product in the sixth,
matrix-oriented loop (602044.0003). A putative protein resulting from
this mutation would be identical to that encoded by the short transcript
of UCP3 mRNA. Pedigree analysis and DNA sequence determination of family
members showed that the R143X mutation was transmitted to the compound
heterozygous proband from the grandmother, through the mother, in
typical mendelian fashion. The heterozygous polymorphism at the exon 6
splice donor junction (Ggt-Gat) was not detected in the maternal lineage
and was most likely transmitted from the father, whose DNA was not
available for analysis, but may have arisen as a new change.
Argyropoulos et al. (1998) examined an additional 168 individuals
comprising both African Americans and Caucasians for the 2 nucleotide
changes. The R143X mutation was not detected in any other individual in
either racial group. The exon 6 splice donor stop mutation, however, was
detected in African-American subjects but not in Caucasians. An
identical allele frequency (G, 90% and A, 10%) was found in
Gullah-speaking African Americans and the Mende tribe. No homozygous
subjects for the polymorphism (a/a) were detected in 287 Gullah-speaking
African Americans and only 3 homozygotes were identified in 192 subjects
of the Mende tribe. Haplotype analysis of 2 polymorphisms, V102I
(602044.0001) and the exon 6 splice donor Ggt-Gat, showed that the 2
genotypes were independent.

UCP3 POLYMORPHISM, EXON 6 SPLICE DONOR JUNCTION
OBESITY, SEVERE
UCP3, IVS6, G-A, +1

In a 16-year-old female with morbid obesity (601665), Argyropoulos et
al. (1998) found compound heterozygosity for a polymorphism at the exon
6 splice donor junction (Ggt-Gat) and the R143X mutation (602004.0002).
The rare R143X mutation was inherited in the maternal line; the splice
site polymorphism was presumably transmitted from the father. The g-to-a
transition at the splice donor site of exon 6 resulted in loss of the
splice junction and truncation of the protein product at the first tga
stop codon of the adjacent intron.

Among unrelated individuals, Argyropoulos et al. (1998) found that
heterozygotes for the exon 6 splice donor polymorphism had a 50%
reduction in fat oxidation adjusted for lean body mass and a marked
elevation in the nonprotein respiratory quotient, compared with wildtype
subjects. No significant differences were found between heterozygotes
and wildtype individuals for BMI, percentage of body fat, and resting
energy expenditure adjusted for lean body mass. The same analyses
performed for the V102I polymorphism (602044.0001) showed no significant
differences between heterozygotes and wildtype individuals for any of
the aforementioned quantitative traits. Nonetheless, the African
American population studied had a high prevalence of obesity; therefore,
the possibility that this could mask a potential effect of UCP3
mutations on BMI was also examined. Indeed, Argyropoulos et al. (1998)
found that the frequency of the g/a heterozygous genotype was nearly
twice as high (P = 0.04) in obese (30%) compared with lean (16%)
individuals.

OBESITY, SEVERE, AND TYPE II DIABETES
UCP3, ARG70TRP

Brown et al. (1999) identified a rare mutation in UCP3, arg70-to-trp, in
a 15-year-old male of Chinese descent with severe obesity (601665) and
type II diabetes (125853). Alignments showed that the mutated valine and
arginine residues in V102I (602044.0001) and R70W are completely
conserved in all known UCPs, including the plant UCP, suggesting that
these residues may play an important functional role. Brown et al.
(1999) expressed native human UCP3 mutations in yeast and showed
complete loss on the uncoupling activity of UCP3 with R70W and no effect
on this activity with V102I.

182350	TITLE *182350 ATPase, Na+/K+ TRANSPORTING, ALPHA-3 POLYPEPTIDE; ATP1A3
;;SODIUM-POTASSIUM-ATPase, ALPHA-3 POLYPEPTIDE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The alpha subunit of the Na,K-ATPase is the catalytic subunit. Three
isoforms are expressed in the nervous system: ATP1A1 (182310), ATP1A2
(182340), and ATP1A3 (de Carvalho Aguiar et al., 2004).

GENE FUNCTION

Agrin (AGRN; 103320) mediates accumulation of acetylcholine receptors at
the developing neuromuscular junction through its interaction with MUSK
(601296), and it has also been implicated in brain development. Through
biochemical studies, Hilgenberg et al. (2006) found that agrin bound
Atp1a3 in mouse cortical neurons. Immunohistochemical analysis showed
that Atp1a3 colocalized with agrin-binding sites at synapses. Agrin
inhibited Atp1a3 activity, resulting in membrane depolarization and
increased action potential frequency in mouse cortical neurons in
culture and acute slice. An agrin fragment that acted as a competitive
antagonist depressed action potential frequency, indicating that
endogenous agrin regulates native Atp1a3 function. Hilgenberg et al.
(2006) concluded that agrin regulates activity-dependent processes in
neurons through its interaction with ATP1A3.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ovchinnikov et al. (1988) determined that the ATP1A3 gene has about
25,000 basepairs and that its protein-coding region includes 23 exons.

MAPPING

By Southern analysis of DNA from panels of rodent/human somatic cell
hybrid lines, Yang-Feng et al. (1988) mapped the ATP1A3 gene to
chromosome 19q12-q13.2. Harley et al. (1988) concluded that the order is
qter--DM--APOC2--ATP1A3--cen.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Dystonia 12

In 7 unrelated families with rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism, or
dystonia-12 (DYT12; 128235), de Carvalho Aguiar et al. (2004) identified
6 different heterozygous mutations in the ATP1A3 gene
(182350.0001-182350.0006). Functional expression studies and structural
analysis suggested that the mutations impaired enzyme activity or
stability.

Anselm et al. (2009) and Blanco-Arias et al. (2009) reported de novo
heterozygous ATP1A3 mutations (182350.0007 and 182350.0008,
respectively) in patients with DYT12.

- Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood 2

In 82 of 105 patients with alternating hemiplegia of childhood-2 (AHC2;
615820), Heinzen et al. (2012) identified 19 different heterozygous
mutations in the ATP1A3 gene (see, e.g., 182350.0009-182350.0012). The
first mutations were identified through exome sequencing of affected
individuals. Thirteen of the 18 mutations observed in sporadic cases
were confirmed to occur de novo. Since it was possible that some
variants represented polymorphisms, Heinzen et al. (2012) estimated that
mutations in the ATP1A3 gene may be responsible for up to 74% of
patients with sporadic, typical AHC. Several mutations were recurrent,
and some occurred within hypermutable sequences. All patients had
infantile onset of hemiplegia attacks, usually associated with episodes
of quadriparesis, abnormal eye movements, autonomic signs, seizures,
dystonia, ataxia, chorea, and developmental delay. Transfection of
several of the mutations in HeLa cells showed protein levels similar to
wildtype, but ATP1A3 activity was significantly decreased. In contrast,
transfection of DYT12-associated mutations resulted in decreased protein
levels as well as decreased activity. The report expanded the spectrum
of phenotypes associated with mutations in the ATP1A3 gene.

ANIMAL MODEL

Ashmore et al. (2009) identified 6 different EMS-induced missense
mutations in the Atp1a2 and Atp1a3 genes in Drosophila. All mutations
resulted in reduced respiration activity consistent with a loss of
ATPase function and a hypomorphic effect. Different mutant strains
exhibited some abnormalities, including progressive
temperature-dependent paralysis, progressive stress-sensitive paralysis,
and decreased locomotor activity in response to startle, suggesting a
decrease in maximal locomotion capacity. Neuromuscular studies showed
allele-specific pathology, including brain vacuoles and myopathology,
and biochemical studies showed decreased metabolic rates. An unexpected
finding was the some mutant strains had increased longevity, which was
not related to caloric restriction. Low doses of ouabain showed a
similar effect on longevity in control groups. Ashmore et al. (2009)
suggested that these findings may be relevant for studying the
pathogenesis of FHM2 and DYT12 (128235).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
DYSTONIA 12
ATP1A3, THR613MET

In a sporadic patient (Linazasoro et al., 2002) and affected members of
a second family (Zaremba et al., 2004) with dystonia-12 (DYT12; 128235),
de Carvalho Aguiar et al. (2004) identified a heterozygous 1838C-T
transition in the ATP1A3 gene, resulting in a thr613-to-met (T613M)
substitution in a highly conserved residue near the phosphorylation
domain on the cytoplasmic face of the protein. The mutation was not
identified in 500 northern European control chromosomes.

Brashear et al. (2007) identified the T613M mutation in a family with
DYT12 reported by Pittock et al. (2000).

.0002
DYSTONIA 12
ATP1A3, ILE274THR

In a patient with dystonia-12 (128235), de Carvalho Aguiar et al. (2004)
identified a heterozygous 821T-C transition in the ATP1A3 gene,
resulting in an ile274-to-thr (I274T) substitution in a highly conserved
residue in the transmembrane domain of the protein. The mutation was not
identified in 500 northern European control chromosomes. The patient had
disease onset at age 37 years.

.0003
DYSTONIA 12
ATP1A3, GLU277LYS

In a patient with dystonia-12 (128235), de Carvalho Aguiar et al. (2004)
identified a heterozygous 829G-A transition in exon 8 of the ATP1A3
gene, resulting in a glu277-to-lys (E277K) substitution in a highly
conserved residue in the transmembrane domain of the protein. The
mutation was not identified in 500 northern European control
chromosomes. The patient had disease onset at age 20 years.

Tarsy et al. (2010) identified the E277K mutation in a 29-year-old woman
of African Caribbean descent with DYT12. She had onset at age 26 years
of weakness and flexion of the left hand and ankle, which progressed
rapidly over the next few years to become frank dystonia of the left arm
and bulbar symptoms, including dysphagia, laryngeal dysfunction with
task-specific dysphonia, and oropharyngeal dysmotility. She also had
mild parkinsonism, with hypomimia and wide-based gait. Treatment with
oral trihexyphenidyl and botulinum injection into selected laryngeal
muscles resulted in clinical improvement.

DYSTONIA 12
ATP1A3, ILE758SER

In 12 affected members of a family with dystonia-12 (128235) reported by
Dobyns et al. (1993), de Carvalho Aguiar et al. (2004) identified a
heterozygous 2273T-G transversion in the ATP1A3 gene, resulting in an
ile758-to-ser (I758S) substitution in a highly conserved residue in the
transmembrane domain of the protein. The mutation was not identified in
500 northern European control chromosomes.

.0005
DYSTONIA 12
ATP1A3, PHE780LEU

In 2 affected members of a family with dystonia-12 (128235), de Carvalho
Aguiar et al. (2004) identified a heterozygous 2338T-C transition in the
ATP1A3 gene, resulting in a phe780-to-leu (F780L) substitution in a
highly conserved residue in the transmembrane region of the protein
close to the extracellular surface. The mutation was not identified in
500 northern European control chromosomes.

.0006
DYSTONIA 12
ATP1A3, ASP801TYR

In 4 affected members of a family with dystonia-12 (128235) reported by
Brashear et al. (1997), de Carvalho Aguiar et al. (2004) identified a
heterozygous 2401G-T transversion in the ATP1A3 gene, resulting in an
asp801-to-tyr (D801Y) substitution in a highly conserved residue in the
transmembrane region of the protein. The mutation was not identified in
500 northern European control chromosomes.

DYSTONIA 12
ATP1A3, ASP923ASN

In a boy with early-onset DYT12 (128235) at age 4 years, Anselm et al.
(2009) identified a heterozygous de novo 2767G-A transition in exon 20
of the ATP1A3 gene, resulting in an asp923-to-asn (D923N) substitution.
The mutation was not found in 338 Caucasian control chromosomes. The
substitution was predicted to occur in a residue buried in the membrane
close to the ion-binding residue gln920, suggesting that it may affect
enzyme activity. He was born of an unaffected Caucasian father and
Chinese mother. The onset of dystonia was abrupt, occurring after mild
trauma to the forehead. He developed mutism, eye convergence, and
inability to walk, which later evolved into severe dystonia, severe
dysarthria, and drooling. The condition stabilized over several months,
and he showed mild improvement over the next 8 years. About a year after
onset, he developed unusual episodes of flaccidity lasting for hours,
later replaced by shorter episodes of stiffness. Treatment with L-dopa
was not effective. At the time of the report, he had bulbar symptoms,
striking oromotor dystonia with inability to speak or swallow well, and
apraxia.

.0008
DYSTONIA 12
ATP1A3, 3-BP DUP, 3191TAC

In a 16-year-old female with DYT12 (128235), Blanco-Arias et al. (2009)
reported a de novo heterozygous 3-bp duplication (3191dupTAC) in exon 23
of the ATP1A3 gene, resulting in duplication of tyr1013, the C-terminal
amino acid of the protein before the stop codon. The mutation was not
found in either parent, her brother, or in 218 control individuals. HeLa
cells expressing the mutant protein showed decreased survival in
response to ouabain challenge, but no defect was detected in protein
expression or plasma membrane targeting. Functional analysis
demonstrated a drastic 40- to 50-fold reduction in Na(+) affinity in the
mutant. Blanco-Arias et al. (2009) suggested a crucial role for the C
terminus of the alpha-subunit in the function of the Na+/K+-ATPase and
emphasized a key impact of Na(+) affinity in the pathophysiology of
DYT12.

ALTERNATING HEMIPLEGIA OF CHILDHOOD 2
ATP1A3, ASP801ASN

In 36 of 95 unrelated patients with alternating hemiplegia of childhood
(614820), Heinzen et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous 2401G-A
transition in the ATP1A3 gene, resulting in an asp801-to-asn (D801N)
substitution in the sixth transmembrane domain. The mutation was
demonstrated to occur de novo in cases where parental material was
available. All patients had infantile onset of hemiplegia attacks,
usually associated with episodes of quadriparesis, abnormal eye
movements, autonomic signs, seizures, dystonia, ataxia, chorea, and
developmental delay. Transfection of the mutation in HeLa cells showed
protein levels similar to wildtype, but ATP1A3 activity was
significantly decreased. Evaluation of the crystal structure of the
protein predicted that the D801N substitution would prevent the binding
of potassium ions to the pump.

ALTERNATING HEMIPLEGIA OF CHILDHOOD 2
ATP1A3, GLU815LYS

In 19 patients with alternating hemiplegia of childhood-2 (614820),
Heinzen et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous 2443G-A transition in
the ATP1A3 gene, resulting in a glu815-to-lys (E815K) substitution in
the sixth transmembrane domain. The mutation was shown to occur de novo
in all patients whose parents were available for study. Transfection of
the mutation in HeLa cells showed protein levels similar to wildtype,
but ATP1A3 activity was significantly decreased.

.0011
ALTERNATING HEMIPLEGIA OF CHILDHOOD 2
ATP1A3, SER811PRO

In 4 unrelated patients with AHC2 (614820), Heinzen et al. (2012)
identified a de novo heterozygous 2431T-C transition in the ATP1A3 gene,
resulting in a ser811-to-pro (S811P) substitution in the sixth
transmembrane domain. Transfection of the mutation in HeLa cells showed
protein levels similar to wildtype, but ATP1A3 activity was
significantly decreased.

.0012
ALTERNATING HEMIPLEGIA OF CHILDHOOD 2
ATP1A3, GLY947ARG

In 5 patients with AHC2 (614820), Heinzen et al. (2012) identified a
heterozygous 2839G-A transition in the ATP1A3 gene, resulting in a
gly947-to-arg (G947R) substitution in the ninth transmembrane domain.
The mutation was shown to occur de novo in all patients whose parents
were available for study.

613574	TITLE *613574 TETRATRICOPEPTIDE REPEAT DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 39B; TTC39B
DESCRIPTION 
MAPPING

Hartz (2010) mapped the TTC39B gene to chromosome 9p22.3 based on an
alignment of the TTC39B sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK091187) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

Teslovich et al. (2010) found that knockdown in mouse liver of the
ortholog Ttc39b via a viral vector resulted in significantly higher
plasma high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Teslovich et al. (2010) performed a genomewide association study of
plasma lipids in more than 100,000 individuals of European ancestry and
reported 95 significantly associated loci (P = less than 5 x 10(-8)),
with 59 showing genomewide significant association with lipid traits for
the first time. The 95 loci contributed not only to normal variation in
lipid traits but also to extreme lipid phenotypes and affected lipid
traits in 3 non-European populations (East Asians, South Asians, and
African Americans). Teslovich et al. (2010) identified dbSNP rs581080, a
SNP in the TTC39B gene on chromosome 9p22, as having an effect on HDL-C
concentrations with an effect size of -0.65 mg per deciliter and a P
value of 3 x 10(-12). In liver, the allele associated with decreased
expression correlated with increased HDL-C.

124070	TITLE *124070 CYTOCHROME P450, SUBFAMILY IIF, POLYPEPTIDE 1; CYP2F1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

CYP2F1 encodes a P450 enzyme capable of metabolizing several
monooxygenase substrates, with the highest activity toward
ethoxycoumarin. Nhamburo et al. (1990) cloned a cDNA coding for a P450,
designated CYP2F1, from a human lung lambda-gt11 library. The
cDNA-encoded protein had 491 amino acids.

MAPPING

By study of somatic cell hybrids, Mitchell et al. (1989) demonstrated
that, like CYP2A (see 122720) and CYP2B (123930), CYP2F1 is located on
human chromosome 19 and mouse chromosome 7.

Based on Southern blotting analysis with multiple restriction enzymes,
Nhamburo et al. (1990) concluded that the CYP2F1 gene is flanked by a
second highly similar gene.

In more than 50 meioses, Bale et al. (1991) found no recombinants
between CYP2F1 and CYP2B and 1 recombinant between CYP2F1 and CYP2A.
Pulsed field gel electrophoresis showed that the 3 loci lie within a
240-kb region. Multipoint analysis of the haplotyped CYP cluster with 4
other chromosome 19 loci yielded the order
D19S7--D19S9--APOC2--D19S8--CYP.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Trask et al. (1993) assigned the
CYP2F gene to 19q13.2.

610120	TITLE *610120 TETRASPANIN 33; TSPAN33
;;PENUMBRA; PEN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The mouse Tspan33 (Penumbra) gene was cloned based on its differential
expression in proerythroblasts/erythroblasts (Pasquini et al., 2003).
Using the mouse Tspan33 sequence as a probe, Pasquini et al. (2003)
cloned a human TSPAN33 cDNA from a bone marrow cDNA library. The deduced
283-amino acid protein shares 97% sequence identity with the mouse
ortholog.

GENE FUNCTION

Using transfection experiments in mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells,
Pasquini et al. (2003) found that Tspan33 exhibited growth-suppressive
activity. Expression of siRNA targeted to the Tspan33 cDNA appeared to
decrease the clonal growth of MEL cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chen et al. (2005) determined that the TSPAN33 gene contains 9 exons and
spans approximately 25 kb.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis and FISH, Chen et al. (2005) mapped the TSPAN33
gene to chromosome 7q32.1, a region that is a hotspot for cytogenetic
abnormalities in myeloid malignancies.

CYTOGENETICS

Using FISH with a mixture of 4 TSPAN33 genomic clones, Chen et al.
(2005) analyzed 7 cases of myeloid malignancies with 7q deletions and
determined that 5 patients with cytogenetic deletions involving
7q31.2-q32 also had TSPAN33 gene deletions. The other 2 patients had
deletions outside the 7q31.2-q32 region.

610590	TITLE *610590 RHO GTPase-ACTIVATING PROTEIN 23; ARHGAP23
;;KIAA1501
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The RHO (see ARHA; 165390) family of small GTPases are involved in
signal transduction through transmembrane receptors, and they are
inactive in the GDP-bound form and active in the GTP-bound form.
GTPase-activating proteins, such as ARHGAP23, inactivate RHO family
proteins by stimulating their hydrolysis of GTP (Katoh and Katoh, 2004).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) isolated a partial cDNA of ARHGAP23, which
they designated KIAA1501. The deduced protein shares significant
similarity with a C. elegans GTPase-activating protein. RT-PCR ELISA
detected very high expression in all adult and fetal tissues and all
specific brain regions examined.

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to ARHGAP21 (609870)
and assembling genomic clones, Katoh and Katoh (2004) obtained a
full-length ARHGAP23. The deduced 1,491-amino acid protein contains a
PDZ domain, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, and a RhoGAP domain.
ARHGAP23 differs significantly from ARHGAP21 at its C-terminal end.
Katoh and Katoh (2004) identified a second ARHGAP23 cDNA that lacks exon
23 sequence and encodes a deduced 1,144-amino acid protein.

GENE STRUCTURE

Katoh and Katoh (2004) determined that the ARHGAP23 gene contains 25
exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the ARHGAP23
gene to chromosome 17. By genomic sequence analysis, Katoh and Katoh
(2004) mapped the ARHGAP23 gene to chromosome 17q12. This locus is
paralogous to the locus on chromosome 10p12 containing ARHGAP21. Katoh
and Katoh (2004) mapped the mouse Arhgap23 gene to chromosome 11D.

613369	TITLE *613369 DEAD BOX POLYPEPTIDE 42; DDX42
;;RNA HELICASE-LIKE PROTEIN; RHELP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using sera from insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (see 222100)
patients to screen a pancreatic islet cell cDNA expression library, Suk
et al. (2000) cloned DDX42, which they called RHELP. The deduced
709-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal ATP-binding domain,
followed by a DEAD box helicase domain and a C-terminal RNA-binding
domain. RHELP shares 42% amino acid identity with p68 (DDX5; 180630).
Northern blot analysis detected a transcript of about 3.3 kb in all
tissues and cell lines examined, with highest expression in brain, lung,
thymus, pancreatic islets, and HeLa cells.

By immunohistochemical analysis, Uhlmann-Schiffler et al. (2009) found
that the full-length 938-amino acid DDX42 protein localized to nuclei of
MCF7 breast cancer cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Uhlmann-Schiffler et al. (2009) found that
DDX42 interacted with the p53 (TP53; 191170)-associated proapoptotic
protein ASPP2 (TP53BP2; 602143) in HeLa cells. Deletion analysis showed
that a C-terminal domain of DDX42 interacted with both a mid-N-terminal
region and the C-terminal ankyrin-SH3 region of ASPP2. DDX42 countered
the proapoptotic effect of ASPP2 in several human cell lines, and this
inhibition required direct interaction between the 2 proteins, was
independent of p53, and appeared to involve sequestration of ASPP2 by
DDX42 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.

MAPPING

Hartz (2010) mapped the DDX42 gene to chromosome 17q23.3 based on an
alignment of the DDX42 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF083255) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using mouse Nemo/Ikk-gamma (IKBKG; 300248) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid
screen, Leonardi et al. (2000) cloned CIKS from a human liver cDNA
library. The deduced 574-amino acid protein contains a C-terminal
leucine zipper. Northern blot analysis of multiple human tissues
indicated ubiquitous expression of a 2.5-kb transcript.

Li et al. (2000) cloned a cDNA encoding ACT1 from a cDNA library
constructed from embryonic kidney cells induced to display constitutive
activation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NFKB; see 164011). The deduced
574-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 60 kD and
contains a helix-loop-helix domain and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain.
The helix-loop-helix domain shares 35% identity with the
helix-loop-helix domain of upstream stimulatory factor-1 (USF1; 191523).
Northern blot analysis detected highest expression in thymus, kidney,
and placenta, moderate expression in heart, skeletal muscle, colon,
liver, lung, and small intestine, and low expression in brain, spleen,
and peripheral blood leukocytes.

By screening thymus, skeletal muscle, and fetal liver cDNA libraries,
Morelli et al. (2000) identified 3 isoforms of ACT1 that they designated
C6ORF4, C6ORF5, and C6ORF6. C6ORF4 encodes a deduced 575-amino acid
protein. C6ORF5 and C6ORF6 result from the skipping of exon 2 and are
differentiated by use of alternate polyadenylation signals, yielding
identical proteins of 566 amino acids. Northern blot analysis detected
5.0- and 2.5-kb transcripts in all tissues examined, with a weak 3.8-kb
transcript in heart, skeletal muscle, and pancreas.

GENE FUNCTION

Leonardi et al. (2000) verified the interaction between CIKS and
IKK-gamma by in vitro binding assays using recombinant proteins and by
coimmunoprecipitation of lysates of transfected HeLa cells or
untransfected Jurkat T-leukemic cells. IKK-alpha (CHUK; 600664) and
IKK-beta (IKBKB; 603258) also coimmunoprecipitated with CIKS. Using
truncation mutants, the authors localized the binding domain to the N
terminus of CIKS. HeLa cells transfected with increasing amounts of CIKS
showed dose-dependent activation of an Ig kappa-B luciferase reporter
plasmid, and the activation could be blocked by cotransfection with
IKK-gamma. Cotransfection of CIKS with kinase-deficient mutants of NIK
(MAP3K14; 604655), MEKK1 (MAP3K1: 600982), IKK-alpha, and IKK-beta
indicated that CIKS activates NFKB exclusively through an IKK-dependent
mechanism. Overexpressed CIKS also potently activated SAPK/JNK (MAPK8;
601158). Analysis of the binding activity of truncation mutants showed
that the C terminus of CIK is involved in SAPK/JNK activation, whereas
the N terminus is necessary and sufficient for kappa-B reporter
activation.

Using gel shift assays, Li et al. (2000) confirmed constitutive
activation of NFKB with transfection of ACT1 into human embryonic kidney
cells. They also found constitutive activation of JNK and IKK.
Disruption of the N-terminal helix-loop-helix domain of ACT1 completely
abolished the interaction between ACT1 and the IKK complex as well as
the activation of NFKB.

By mutation analysis, Pacifico et al. (2003) identified a sequence in
the 5-prime flanking region of human CIKS that was essential for basal
promoter activity in a canine kidney cell line. RT-PCR, Northern, and
Western blot analyses showed that various proinflammatory cytokines
upregulated CIKS expression in HeLa cells.

Using immunoprecipitation analysis, Qian et al. (2007) found that IL17
(603149) induced association of ACT1 with IL17RA (605461) in various
cell types. The ACT1-IL17RA interaction required the SEFIR domain of
IL17RA. Expression of Il17-dependent inflammation-related genes was
abolished in Act1-deficient mouse cells. Mice lacking Act1 had delayed
onset and lower severity of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, as
well as limited colitis. Qian et al. (2007) concluded that ACT1 is
essential for IL17-dependent signaling in autoimmune and inflammatory
disease.

GENE STRUCTURE

Morelli et al. (2000) determined that the ACT1 gene contains 10 exons
and spans more than 50 kb. They also identified C6UAS, which overlaps
exon 2 and is transcribed in the antisense orientation from the
complementary strand of C6ORF4. C6UAS has no apparent open reading
frame, but Morelli et al. (2000) provided experimental evidence that it
has a regulatory function and can behave as an antisense RNA in the
control of C6ORF4 translation.

Pacifico et al. (2003) mapped the CIKS transcription start site and
found that the 5-prime flanking region was TATA-less, but it had
initiator, GC, and CAAT boxes.

MAPPING

Morelli et al. (2000) identified ACT1 within an EST clone that maps to
chromosome 6q21.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Ellinghaus et al. (2010) and Huffmeier et al. (2010) independently
identified association of a coding single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP),
dbSNP rs33980500 (607043.0001), in the TRAF3IP2 gene with psoriasis
susceptibility (PSORS13; 614070).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PSORIASIS SUSCEPTIBILITY 13
TRAF3IP2, ASP19ASN (dbSNP rs33980500)

In a case-control genomewide association study of psoriasis
susceptibility (PSORS13; 614070), Ellinghaus et al. (2010) identified a
coding SNP, dbSNP rs33980500, in exon 2 of the TRAF3IP2 gene. A C-to-T
transition results in substitution of asn for asp at codon 19 (D19N).
This SNP was significantly associated with risk for psoriasis vulgaris
(P = 1.24 x 10(-16)) and psoriatic arthritis (P = 4.57 x 10(-12)).

In an independent case-control genomewide association study, Huffmeier
et al. (2010) found significant association of dbSNP rs33980500 with
psoriatic arthritis in a subset of cases and controls (P = 1.13 x
10(-20), OR = 1.95). Functional assays showed reducing binding of this
TRAF3IP2 variant to TRAF6 (602355), suggesting altered modulation of
immunoregulatory signals through altered TRAF interactions as a novel
and shared pathway for psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis vulgaris.
Huffmeier et al. (2010) referred to the amino acid change correlated
with this SNP as ASP10ASN.

HGK;;
NCK-INTERACTING KINASE; NIK
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Activation of the JNK (see 601158) pathway by a variety of environmental
and extracellular stimuli is mediated by multiple STE20-like protein
kinases (e.g., STK25, 602255). By screening a human macrophage cDNA
library with degenerate PCR primers to sequences of STE20 family
members, Yao et al. (1999) obtained a novel cDNA that they termed HGK
(for HPK1/GCK-like kinase). The HGK cDNA encodes a 1,165-amino acid
protein. Its N terminus has a catalytic kinase domain with 11 kinase
subdomains. It shares 47% and 48% amino acid sequence identity to the
catalytic domain of HPK1 (601983) and GCK (603166), respectively. The
authors identified 2 HGK isoforms, one of which has no proline-rich
domains, and another, longer variant that contains such domains and
appears to be expressed in brain only. Northern blot analysis revealed
expression of 3 HGK transcripts of approximately 4.6, 6.5, and 8.5 kb in
heart, brain, skeletal muscle, pancreas, placenta, liver, lung, and
kidney. By Western blot analysis with a polyclonal antibody, Yao et al.
(1999) found that the 130-kD protein is expressed in multiple cell
lines. Expression of HGK in transfected cell lines resulted in strong
JNK activation and, in turn, c-jun transcriptional activity. HGK-induced
JNK activation was inhibited by dominant-negative MKK4 (MAP2K4; 601335),
MKK7 (MAP2K7; 603014), and TAK1 (MAP3K7; 602614) mutants. TNFA (191160)
also stimulated HGK kinase activity.

GENE FUNCTION

Using an RNA interference-based screen, Tang et al. (2006) found 4
negative regulators of insulin-responsive glucose transport in mouse
adipocytes: Pctk1 (311550), Pftk1 (610679), Ikbka (CHUK; 600664), and
Map4k4. Map4k4 suppressed expression of adipogenic transcription
factors, Cebpa (116897), Cebpb (189965), and Pparg (601487), and it
suppressed surface expression of Glut4 (SLC2A4; 138190), resulting in
attenuated membrane hexose transport activity. Depletion of Map4k4 by
RNA interference early in differentiation enhanced adipogenesis and
triglyceride deposition; in fully differentiated adipocytes, loss of
Map4k4 upregulated Glut4 expression. Conversely, conditions that
inhibited adipogenesis, such as Tnfa treatment or Pparg depletion,
markedly upregulated Map4k4. Tang et al. (2006) concluded that
MAP4K4-dependent signaling inhibited PPARG-responsive gene expression,
adipogenesis, and insulin-stimulated glucose transport.

Aouadi et al. (2009) reported the engineering of
beta-1,3-D-glucan-encapsulated siRNA particles (GeRPs) as efficient oral
delivery vehicles that potently silenced genes in mouse macrophages in
vitro and in vivo. Oral gavage of mice with GeRPs containing as little
as 20 micrograms per kilogram siRNA directed against TNF-alpha (191160)
depleted its mRNA in macrophages recovered from peritoneum, spleen,
liver, and lung, and lowered serum TNF-alpha levels. Screening with
GeRPs for inflammation genes revealed that Map4k4 is a mediator of
cytokine expression. Importantly, silencing Map4k4 in macrophages in
vivo protected mice from lipopolysaccharide-induced lethality by
inhibiting TNF-alpha and interleukin-1-beta (147720) production. Aouadi
et al. (2009) concluded that their technology defined a strategy for
oral delivery of siRNA to attenuate inflammatory responses in human
disease.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids, Ishikawa et al. (1998) mapped the
MAP4K4 gene, which they termed KIAA0687, to chromosome 2.

607647	TITLE *607647 PLASMALEMMA VESICLE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; PLVAP
;;PLASMALEMMA VESICLE PROTEIN 1; PV1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using rat Pv1 as query, Stan et al. (2001) identified ESTs containing
mouse and human PLVAP. They characterized human PLVAP cDNAs from lung,
colon, and pancreas. The deduced 442-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of about 50 kD. PLVAP is a type II integral membrane
protein with a short N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a single-span
transmembrane domain, and a large C-terminal extracellular domain
consisting mostly of alpha helices. It also contains 2 coiled-coil
domains predicted to contribute to dimer formation. The extracellular
domain has 4 N-glycosylation sites, a proline-rich region, and regular
spacing of cysteine residues. The deduced 439-amino acid mouse Plvap
protein contains a consensus casein kinase II (see 115440)
phosphorylation site that is not found in the human protein. Rat Plvap
contains 2 casein kinase II phosphorylation sites. Northern blot
analysis revealed a single PLVAP transcript of about 2.4 kb in pancreas,
kidney, placenta, muscle, lung, heart, and liver. No signal was detected
in brain or testis. Northern dot blot analysis revealed expression in
several other tissues, including aorta, pituitary, adrenals, mammary
gland, bladder, lymph node, bone marrow, trachea, placenta, and all
segments of the digestive tract from the esophagus to the rectum. No
expression was detected in brain, testis, ovary, leukocytes, and lung.
Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues showed an expression pattern
similar to that found in human tissues, but the quantitative
distribution varied between mouse and human.

Niemela et al. (2005) identified PLVAP as the target of the
pathologische anatomie Leiden-endothelium (PAL-E) antibody, a long used
marker for vascular endothelial cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Keuschnigg et al. (2009) found that stimulation of human umbilical vein
endothelial cells with TNF (191160) led to redistribution of PV1 to the
peripheral areas of the cells. Transcellular migrating lymphocytes were
surrounded by rings containing PV1 and CAV1 (601047).
Coimmunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy demonstrated that PV1
physically associated with vimentin (VIM; 193060). Anti-PV1 caused a
significant inhibition of lymphocyte transmigration through endothelial
cells, but rolling and adhesion were not affected. In vivo blockade of
Pv1 in mouse acute peritonitis and air pouch models resulted in a
significant decrease in the number of migrating leukocytes. Keuschnigg
et al. (2009) concluded that PV is involved in leukocyte
transendothelial cell migration.

GENE STRUCTURE

Stan et al. (2001) determined that the PLVAP gene contains 6 exons and
spans more than 26 kb. The promoter region contains a classical TATA box
and binding sites for MZF1 (194550), SP1 (189906), RXRA (180245), AP2
(107580), and 3 GATA transcription factors (see 305371).

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis and radiation hybrid analysis, Stan et al.
(2001) mapped the PLVAP gene to chromosome 19p13.2, about 25 kb
downstream from BST2 (600534). They mapped the mouse Plvap gene to
chromosome 8B3-C1, a region that shows homology of synteny to human
chromosome 19p13-p12.

;;LYMPHOCYTE MET-ASE 1;;
PROTEASE, SERINE, NATURAL KILLER CELL, MET-ASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Human natural killer (NK) cells and activated lymphocytes express and
store a distinct subset of neutral serine proteases together with
proteoglycans and other immune effector molecules in large cytoplasmic
granules. These serine proteases are collectively termed granzymes and
include 4 distinct gene products: granzyme A (140050), granzyme B
(123910), granzyme H (116831), and Met-ase, also known as granzyme M
(Pilat et al., 1994).

CLONING

Using a rat cDNA as a probe, Pilat et al. (1994) identified cosmid
clones containing the genes for the human and murine granzyme M.

GENE STRUCTURE

Pilat et al. (1994) found that the human GZMM gene has a size of 7.5 kb
and an exon-intron structure identical to that of other serine protease
genes.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Pilat et al. (1994) mapped the
GZMM gene to chromosome 19p13.3. Interphase studies with 2
differentially labeled probes for GZMM and the azurocidin (AZU1;
162815), proteinase-3 (PRTN3; 177020), and elastase-2 (ELA2; 130130)
gene cluster indicated that the GZMM gene is 200 to 500 kb from that
gene cluster. Using differentially labeled mouse cosmid probes, they
also mapped the murine gene to chromosomal band 10C, close to the gene
for lamin B2. Thus, these genes fall into an established region of
homology between mouse chromosomal band 10C and human 19p13.3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Pao et al. (2005) generated Gzmm-deficient mice. FACS analysis showed
that NK- and T-cell development and homeostasis were normal in these
mice. Gzmm was not essential for NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, but
Gzmm-deficient mice had an altered response to murine cytomegalovirus
(CMV) infection, with increased number of cells showing cytomegaly and
increased frequency of viral inclusions. Responses to ectromelia virus
were not distinguishable from those in wildtype mice. Pao et al. (2005)
concluded that GZMM is not critical for NK-cell function, but it has a
role in host response to CMV infection.
