611838	TITLE *611838 MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN L30; MRPL30
;;MRPL28
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mitochondria have their own translation system for production of 13
proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation. MRPL30 is 1 of more
than 70 protein components of mitochondrial ribosomes that are encoded
by the nuclear genome (Kenmochi et al., 2001).

CLONING

By searching databases for homologs of rat Mrpl28, Goldschmidt-Reisin et
al. (1998) identified mouse and human MRPL30, which they called MRPL28.
The deduced 162-amino acid human MRPL30 protein contains a 34-amino acid
N-terminal mitochondrial import signal.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis and analysis of an integrated BAC-STS map,
Kenmochi et al. (2001) mapped the MRPL30 gene to chromosome 2q11.2.

609332	TITLE *609332 TETRATRICOPEPTIDE REPEAT DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 7A; TTC7A
;;TTC7;;
KIAA1140
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain is defined by a degenerate
consensus sequence of 34 amino acids. TPR domain-containing proteins,
such as TTC7A, have diverse functions in cell cycle control, protein
transport, phosphate turnover, and protein trafficking or secretion, and
they can act as chaperones or scaffolding proteins (White et al., 2005).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a brain cDNA library, Hirosawa et al.
(1999) cloned TTC7A, which they designated KIAA1140. The deduced protein
contains more than 700 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA detected low to
intermediate expression in all adult and fetal tissues and specific
brain regions examined.

By analyzing genes located in a region of mouse chromosome 17 associated
with abnormal iron homeostasis, White et al. (2005) cloned Ttc7a. The
deduced protein contains 7 TPR repeats, each of which has a helix-snap
domain and forms alpha-helix segments.

GENE STRUCTURE

White et al. (2005) determined that the mouse Ttc7a gene contains 20
exons and spans about 100 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Hirosawa et al. (1999) mapped the TTC7A
gene to chromosome 2. White et al. (2005) mapped the mouse Ttc7a gene to
chromosome 17E4.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 6 French Canadian families with multiple intestinal atresia (MINAT;
243150), Samuels et al. (2013) identified homozygosity for a 4-bp
deletion in the TTC7A gene (609332.0001) that was confirmed by Sanger
sequencing and segregated with disease in each family. In another
affected French Canadian family, 2 sibs were compound heterozygous for
the 4-bp deletion and a missense mutation (L823P; 609332.0002) in the
TTC7A gene. Samuels et al. (2013) concluded that TTC7A is the likely
causal gene for multiple intestinal atresia.

ANIMAL MODEL

White et al. (2005) identified abnormalities in the mouse Ttc7a gene
associated with 2 spontaneous autosomal recessive diseases of iron
homeostasis: hereditary erythroblastic anemia (hea) and flaky skin
(fsn). Hea mice have reduced red blood cell number, hemoglobin, and
hematocrit, and elevated numbers of circulating nucleated red blood
cells. Hea mice die within 1 week of age. Fsn mice have severe
hypochromic anemia and flaky, crusty skin that resembles psoriasis. Fsn
mice lack splenic and hepatic stores of iron, secrete significant levels
of iron into the urine, and die at 3 months of age. White et al. (2005)
determined that hea results from a deletion of exons 1 through 14 of the
Ttc7a gene, and fsn results from a 183-bp insertion between exons 14 and
15 of the Ttc7a gene, caused by retrotransposon integration.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
INTESTINAL ATRESIA, MULTIPLE
TTC7A, 4-BP DEL, 53344AAGT

In 4 affected individuals from 3 unrelated French-Canadian families with
multiple intestinal atresia (MINAT; 243150), Samuels et al. (2013)
identified homozygosity for a 4-bp deletion (c.53344_53347delAAGT) at
the splice donor site of exon 7 of the TTC7A gene. The deletion was
found in heterozygosity in both parents from each family, as well as
both parents from 2 more French Canadian families in which DNA was
unavailable from the deceased affected children. Unaffected sibs in
these families were either heterozygous for the deletion or did not
carry it at all. Sequencing of the cDNA product from patient RNA
revealed that exon 7 was skipped, with splicing of exon 6 directly to
exon 8; this aberrant splicing generated a 158-bp deletion in the
resulting cDNA, predicted to cause a frameshift with 49 new amino acids
followed by a termination codon. In human lymphocyte RNA sequencing data
from other unrelated projects, Samuels et al. (2013) found rare examples
of reads skipping exon 7, with 4 of 880 reads excluding exon 7; they
suggested that exon 7 inclusion may be intrinsically variable even with
a wildtype splice donor site. In 2 affected sibs from a seventh French
Canadian family, Samuels et al. (2013) identified compound
heterozygosity for the 4-bp deletion and a c.13307A-G transition in exon
20 of the TTC7A gene, resulting in a leu823-to-pro (L823P; 609332.0002)
substitution at a highly conserved residue in the carboxy terminus. The
authors concluded that the 4-bp deletion represents a founder mutation
in the French Canadaian population, with the L823P missense mutation
having arisen more recently or being derived from a British or Scottish
population.

194360	TITLE *194360 X-RAY REPAIR, COMPLEMENTING DEFECTIVE, IN CHINESE HAMSTER, 1; XRCC1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Human cells fused with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) mutant lines,
defective at different genes for excision repair of DNA following
ultraviolet (UV) irradiation or defective in repair following
X-irradiation, produce hybrids that retain the human gene that
complements the defect in the CHO line when selected under conditions
that require repair. To produce transgenic mice that carry a mutation in
the Xrcc1 locus, Brookman et al. (1994) cloned the murine homolog of
XRCC1 from both cosmid genomic and cDNA libraries. cDNA analysis
indicated a 1,893-bp open reading frame encoding a protein of only 631
amino acids, compared with the 633-amino acid polypeptide of human
XRCC1. Lamerdin et al. (1995) found that the human and mouse proteins
share 86% sequence identity.

GENE FUNCTION

Whitehouse et al. (2001) reported that XRCC1 interacts with human
polynucleotide kinase (PNK; 605610) in addition to its interactions with
DNA polymerase-beta (POLB; 174760) and DNA ligase III (LIG3; 600940).
Moreover, these 4 proteins are coassociated in multiprotein complexes in
human cell extract, and together they repair single-strand breaks
typical of those induced by reactive oxygen species and ionizing
radiation. Strikingly, XRCC1 stimulates the DNA kinase and DNA
phosphatase activities of PNK at damaged DNA termini, thereby
accelerating the overall repair reaction. These data identified a novel
pathway for mammalian single-strand break repair and demonstrated a
concerted role for XRCC1 and PNK in the initial step of processing
damaged DNA ends. In vitro, Sano et al. (2004) demonstrated that the
long form of aprataxin (APTX; 606350), but not the short form, interacts
with the C-terminal domain of XRCC1, suggesting that aprataxin may be
involved in the repair complex.

Bhattacharyya and Banerjee (2001) found that XRCC1 interacts with a
truncated POLB that is expressed in primary colorectal and breast tumors
and inhibits the normal repair function of wildtype POLB. They
determined that the interaction of the variant POLB and XRCC1 is
required for the dominant inhibitory effect.

Loizou et al. (2004) showed that casein kinase II (CK2; see 115440)
phosphorylates XRCC1 and thereby enables the assembly and activity of
DNA single-strand break repair protein complexes in vitro and at sites
of chromosome breakage. Inhibition of XRCC1 phosphorylation by mutation
of the CK2 phosphorylation sites or by preventing CK2 activity using a
highly specific inhibitor ablated the rapid repair of cellular DNA
single-strand breaks by XRCC1. These data identified a direct role for
CK2 in the repair of chromosome DNA strand breaks and in maintaining
genetic integrity.

Luo et al. (2004) provided biochemical data to demonstrate that 2
preformed XRCC1 protein complexes exist in cycling HeLa cells. One
complex contains known enzymes that are important for single-stranded
break repair, including LIG3, PNK, and POLB; the other is a new complex
that contains LIG3 and aprataxin. Luo et al. (2004) reported the
characterization of the new XRCC1 complex. XRCC1 is phosphorylated in
vivo and in vitro by CK2, and CK2 phosphorylation of XRCC1 on ser518,
thr519, and thr523 largely determines aprataxin binding to XRCC1 through
its FHA domain. An acute loss of aprataxin by small interfering RNA
renders HeLa cells sensitive to methyl methanesulfonate treatment by a
mechanism of shortened half-life of XRCC1. Thus, Luo et al. (2004)
concluded that aprataxin plays a role to maintain the steady-state
protein level of XRCC1. Luo et al. (2004) concluded that collectively,
their data provide insights into the single-strand break repair
molecular machinery in the cell and point to involvement of aprataxin in
this process, thus linking single-stranded break repair to the
neurologic disease ataxia-oculomotor apraxia (208920).

Using primary human fibroblasts, Moser et al. (2007) showed that XRCC1
and LIG3 were essential core components of nucleotide excision repair
(NER). Downregulation of LIG3 impaired removal of UV-induced lesions and
rejoining of UV-induced nicks in chromosomal DNA. Moreover, XRCC1-LIG3
and polymerase-delta (see POLD1; 174761) interacted and colocalized with
NER components in a UV-specific manner throughout interphase. In
contrast, recruitment of LIG1 (126391) and polymerase-epsilon (POLE;
174762) to UV-irradiated sites was only observed in proliferating cells.
Moser et al. (2007) concluded that DNA ligases and polymerases are
differentially recruited for NER-mediated DNA repair during the cell
cycle.

Gao et al. (2011) reported that DNA ligase III is essential for
mitochondrial DNA integrity but dispensable for nuclear DNA repair.
Inactivation of ligase III in the mouse nervous system resulted in mtDNA
loss leading to profound mitochondrial dysfunction, disruption of
cellular homeostasis, and incapacitating ataxia. Similarly, inactivation
of ligase III in cardiac muscle resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction
and defective heart-pump function leading to heart failure. However,
ligase III inactivation did not result in nuclear DNA repair deficiency,
indicating essential DNA repair repair functions of Xrcc1 can occur in
the absence of ligase III. Instead, Gao et al. (2011) found that ligase
I was critical for DNA repair, but acted in a cooperative manner with
ligase III. Additionally, ligase III deficiency did not recapitulate the
hallmark features of neural Xrcc1 inactivation such as DNA
damage-induced cerebellar interneuron loss, further underscoring
functional separation of these DNA repair factors. Therefore, Gao et al.
(2011) concluded that the biological role of ligase III is to maintain
mtDNA integrity and not XRCC1-dependent DNA repair.

Simsek et al. (2011) demonstrated a crucial role for DNA ligase III in
mitochondria but not in XRCC1-dependent repair. Simsek et al. (2011)
used preemptive complementation to determine the viability requirement
for Lig3in mammalian cells and its requirement in DNA repair. Various
forms of Lig3 were introduced stably into mouse embryonic stem cells
containing a conditional allele of Lig3 that could be deleted with Cre
recombinase. With this approach, Gao et al. (2011) found that the
mitochondrial, but not nuclear, Lig3 is required for the cellular
viability. Although the catalytic function of Lig3 is required, the zinc
finger and BRAC1 C-terminal-related domains of Lig3 are not. Remarkably,
the viability requirement for Lig3 can be circumvented by targeting Lig1
to the mitochondria or expressing Chlorella virus DNA ligase, the
minimal eukaryal nick-sealing enzyme, or Escherichia coli LigA, an
NAD(+)-dependent ligase. Lig3-null cells were not sensitive to several
DNA-damaging agents that sensitize Xrcc1-deficient cells. Simsek et al.
(2011) concluded that their results established a role for Lig3 in
mitochondria, but distinguished it from its interacting protein XRCC1.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lamerdin et al. (1995) characterized the genomic structure of XRCC1 in
humans and mice. The human gene has 17 exons and spans approximately
31.9 kb.

MAPPING

The first x-ray repair complementing gene (XRCC1) was mapped to
19qcen-19q13.3 on the basis of the loss of 19p markers, retention of
proximal 19q markers, and loss of more distal 19q markers (Siciliano et
al., 1987). By Southern analysis of DNAs from a hybrid panel using
probes for the 3 DNA repair genes located on chromosome 19, Thompson et
al. (1989) concluded that ERCC2 (126340) is distal to XRCC1 and in the
same region, namely 19q13.2-q13.3, as ERCC1 (126380), but on different
MluI macrorestriction fragments. Similar experiments using a hybrid
clone panel containing segregating Chinese hamster chromosomes showed
that the hamster homologs of the 3 repair genes are part of a highly
conserved linkage group on Chinese hamster chromosome 9. The
hemizygosity of hamster chromosome 9 in CHO cells can account for the
high frequency at which genetically recessive mutations are recovered in
these 3 genes in CHO cells. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Trask
et al. (1993) assigned the XRCC1 gene to 19q13.2.

By metaphase in situ hybridization Brookman et al. (1994) mapped the
mouse Xrcc1 gene to the A3-B2 region of chromosome 7.

601901	TITLE *601901 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 8 (SODIUM-CALCIUM EXCHANGER), MEMBER 2; SLC8A2
;;SODIUM-CALCIUM EXCHANGER 2; NCX2;;
KIAA1087
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Li et al. (1994) cloned a partial human cDNA of a novel sodium-calcium
exchanger and, using the partial cDNA, cloned a full-length rat cDNA.
This exchanger was more than 60% similar to NCX1 (182305) and thus was
termed Ncx2. The rat gene predicts a protein of 921 amino acids. The
5-kb transcript was detected in rat brain and skeletal muscle.

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Kikuno et al. (1999) cloned SLC8A2, which they designated
KIAA1087. The deduced full-length protein contains 952 amino acids and
shares 97% identity with the rat Ncx2 precursor. RT-PCR ELISA detected
intermediate expression in adult brain, with lower levels in fetal
brain, adult pancreas, testis, and ovary. Little to no expression was
detected in all other organs and tissues examined. Within specific adult
brain regions, expression was highest in amygdala, cerebellum, and
caudate nucleus, with intermediate levels in all other regions examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Li et al. (1994) showed that expression of the rat Ncx2 cDNA produced
functional sodium and calcium exchange.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Kikuno et al. (1999) mapped the SLC8A2
gene to chromosome 19. Li et al. (1994) had originally mapped the NCX2
gene to chromosome 14, a location that corresponds to the NCX3 gene
(607991).

Gross (2011) mapped the SLC8A2 gene to chromosome 19q13.32 based on an
alignment of the SLC8A2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK293836) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

Nicoll et al. (1996) mapped the mouse Slc8A2 gene to the proximal region
of mouse chromosome 7, where it is tightly linked to the Apoe gene
(107741).

607170	TITLE *607170 CYSTEINE-RICH PROTEIN WITH EGF-LIKE DOMAINS 1; CRELD1
;;CIRRIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Epidermal growth factor (EGF; 131530)-like repeats are a class of
cysteine-rich domains that mediate interactions between proteins of
diverse function. EGF domains are found in proteins that are either
completely secreted or have transmembrane regions that tether the
protein to the cell surface. CRELD1 is the founding member of a family
of matricellular proteins.

CLONING

By screening EST clones mapped to chromosome 3p25-p24.2, Rupp et al.
(2002) identified CRELD1, which shows sequence similarity to
extracellular matrix proteins. The full-length clone encodes a deduced
420-amino acid protein. Structural analysis suggested that CRELD1 is a
cell adhesion molecule that contains an N-terminal signal sequence; 2
type III transmembrane domains separated by a short cytoplasmic loop; a
tandem array of EGF-like repeats; and a region rich in glutamate and
tryptophan residues (WE domain). It also has 2 putative N-linked
glycosylation sites and several possible serine, threonine, and tyrosine
phosphorylation sites. Utilization of an alternative exon 9 (exon 9b
within intron 9) results in a protein with a unique C terminus that has
no predicted transmembrane domain. Rupp et al. (2002) also cloned the
cow and mouse orthologs of CRELD1, which share 94% and 92% amino acid
identity with human CRELD1, respectively. Database analysis revealed
that the CRELD1 gene is highly conserved across species, including
Drosophila and C. elegans.

Using Northern blot analysis, Rupp et al. (2002) detected ubiquitous
expression of a major 2.1-kb CRELD1 transcript, with highest expression
in fetal lung, liver, and kidney, and in adult heart, brain, and
skeletal muscle. Adult brain also showed an alternative transcript of
2.5 kb, and several heart regions showed an additional transcript of 2.3
kb. By Northern array analysis, Rupp et al. (2002) determined that the
variant that utilizes exon 9b is expressed in adult brain, thymus, lymph
node, and several areas of the gastrointestinal tract, and in fetal
spleen, thymus, and lung. In situ hybridization in developing chick
embryos revealed expression of Creld1 at all time points and localized
high levels of expression in the developing heart, limb buds, mandible,
branchial arches, and brain.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rupp et al. (2002) determined that the CRELD1 gene contains 11 exons
spanning approximately 12 kb. The major 2.1-kb transcript utilizes exons
1 through 10. There are repetitive elements (SINE and LINE class) in
introns 1, 2, 3, 4, and 9 and a simple hexanucleotide repeat in intron
6.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis and analysis of a BAC contig, Rupp et al.
(2002) mapped the CRELD1 gene to chromosome 3p25.3. Radiation hybrid
analysis localized the mouse Creld1 gene to distal chromosome 6, which
shows homology of synteny with human chromosome 3p25.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Rupp et al. (2002) noted that the CRELD1 gene is in a region of loss of
heterozygosity for several types of cancer.

In a patient with an isolated atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD2;
606217), Robinson et al. (2003) identified an arg329-to-cys mutation
(R329C; 607170.0001) in the CRELD1 gene, which was present but not
expressed in the proband's father, brother, or sister. These findings
were consistent with previous observations of incomplete penetrance in
AVSD (Pierpont et al., 2000). Given the low penetrance observed in this
family, Robinson et al. (2003) proposed that CRELD1 is an AVSD
susceptibility gene and that CRELD1 mutations increase the risk of
developing a heart defect, rather than being directly causative. In 2
other patients, Robinson et al. (2003) identified thr311-to-ile (T311I;
607170.0002) and arg107-to-his (R107H; 607170.0003) mutations,
respectively.

Among 49 patients with AVSD, Zatyka et al. (2005) identified 5 novel
sequence variants in the CRELD1 gene. Three of the novel variants were
also identified in normal controls, 1 was a silent change, and 1 was
also seen in 2 family members without congenital heart disease
(607170.0004). Genetic analysis of 12 patients with 3p- syndrome
(613792) showed that the CRELD1 gene was deleted in all 5 patients with
an AVSD but was also deleted in 4 patients without congenital heart
disease. Zatyka et al. (2005) concluded that CRELD1 deletions are
unlikely to account for AVSD in children with 3p deletions but that rare
missense mutations may confer susceptibility to AVSD in a subset of
patients.

Because trisomy 21 (190685) is by far the most common finding associated
with AVSD, Maslen et al. (2006) analyzed the CRELD1 gene in 39
individuals with Down syndrome and complete AVSD. They identified
heterozygosity for missense mutations in 2 infants (607170.0001 and
607170.0005, respectively), and suggested that defects in CRELD1 may
contribute to the pathogenesis of AVSD in the context of trisomy 21.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ATRIOVENTRICULAR SEPTAL DEFECT, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 2
CRELD1, ARG329CYS

In an individual with an isolated partial atrioventricular septal defect
(606217), Robinson et al. (2003) identified a heterozygous 4201C-T
transition in exon 9 of the CRELD1 gene, resulting in an arg329-to-cys
(R329C) substitution in the second cb-EGF domain. The addition of a free
cysteine residue to a cb-EGF domain disrupted its disulfide bonding
pattern. The mutation was inherited from the father who, like a brother
and sister of the proband who also carried the mutation, did not report
having a heart defect. Special studies likewise showed structurally
normal hearts. These findings were consistent with previous observations
of incomplete penetrance in AVSD (Pierpont et al., 2000).

In an infant with Down syndrome (190685) and complete atrioventricular
septal defect, Maslen et al. (2006) identified heterozygosity for the
R329C mutation. The infant also had patent ductus arteriosus, tricuspid
regurgitation, anomalous hepatic drainage to the right atrium, and
pulmonary hypertension. The mutation was inherited from the mother, a
normal euploid individual with no evidence of a heart defect. The
mutation was not found in 30 individuals with Down syndrome and no heart
defect by echocardiography.

Ackerman et al. (2012) identified this mutation in 2 individuals with
Down syndrome and atrioventricular septal defect. The mutation was not
seen in 141 controls who had Down syndrome but no AVSD.

In an individual with an isolated partial atrioventricular septal defect
(606217), Robinson et al. (2003) identified a heterozygous 4148C-T
transition in exon 9 of the CRELD1 gene, resulting in a thr311-to-ile
(T311I) mutation in the second cb-EGF domain.

.0003
ATRIOVENTRICULAR SEPTAL DEFECT, PARTIAL, WITH HETEROTAXY SYNDROME

In a patient of mixed Hispanic and African American descent with partial
atrioventricular septal defect and features of heterotaxy syndrome
(dextrocardia, right ventricle aorta with pulmonary atresia, and right
aortic arch) (see 606217), Robinson et al. (2003) identified a
heterozygous 1566G-A transition in exon 3 of the CRELD1 gene, resulting
in an arg107-to-his (R107H) mutation in the highly conserved WE domain
of the gene. No extracardiac abnormalities were detected.

.0004
ATRIOVENTRICULAR SEPTAL DEFECT, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 2
CRELD1, PRO162ALA

In a patient with sporadic partial atrioventricular septal defect
(600309) and a 47,XXX karyotype, Zatyka et al. (2005) identified a
484C-G transversion in exon 5 of the CRELD1 gene, resulting in a
pro162-to-ala (P162A) substitution. The mutation was not identified in
200 control chromosomes but was found in the patient's mother and
maternal grandmother, neither of whom had congenital heart disease.
Zatyka et al. (2005) suggested that the P162A mutation, if causative,
showed reduced penetrance.

.0005
ATRIOVENTRICULAR SEPTAL DEFECT, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 2
CRELD1, GLU414LYS

In an infant with Down syndrome (190685) and complete balanced
atrioventricular septal defect and tricuspid regurgitation, Maslen et
al. (2006) identified heterozygosity for a 1240G-A transition in exon 10
of the CRELD1 gene, resulting in a glu414-to-lys (E414K) substitution.
The mutation was not found in either parent, in 400 race-relevant
chromosomes, or in 30 individuals with Down syndrome and no heart defect
by echocardiography.

Ackerman et al. (2012) identified this mutation in 1 patient with Down
syndrome and AVSD; it was not identified in 141 individuals with Down
syndrome and no congenital heart defect.

613914	TITLE *613914 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 746; ZNF746
;;PARKIN-INTERACTING SUBSTRATE; PARIS
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using parkin (PARK2; 602544) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a
human brain cDNA library, Shin et al. (2011) cloned ZNF746, which they
called PARIS. The deduced 644-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal
Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) and a C-terminal C2HC/C2H2-type zinc
finger. Northern blot analysis of human tissues and immunoblot analysis
of mouse tissues showed ubiquitous expression of PARIS.
Immunohistochemical analysis of mouse brain showed that Paris localized
to neurons. PARIS colocalized with parkin in cell bodies in primary rat
cortical neurons and in human SH-SY5Y dopaminergic-like cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Shin et al. (2011) showed that PARIS coimmunoprecipitated with parkin
from whole human striatum or mouse brain. Domain mapping indicated that
parkin bound to the C-terminal domain of PARIS. In SH-SY5Y cells, parkin
ubiquitinated epitope-tagged PARIS on lys48 in the presence of various
E2 enzymes (see 601661), leading to PARIS degradation via the proteasome
system. PARIS levels were elevated in the cingulate cortex of patients
with autosomal recessive parkinson disease (PD) (600116), in the
striatum and substantia nigra of patients with sporadic PD, and in an
adult mouse PD model following conditional parkin knockout. Using a pool
of random oligonucleotides with immobilized PARIS, followed by
electrophoretic mobility shift assays, Shin et al. (2011) showed that
PARIS bound the core sequence TATTTT(T/G), which is an insulin response
sequence (IRS) designated the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK;
see 261680)-like motif (PLM). PARIS also bound the 5-prime region of the
transcriptional coactivator PGC1-alpha (PPARGC1A; 604517), which
contains 3 IRS/PLM elements. PARIS repressed PGC1-alpha expression in
SH-SY5Y cells and in control and PD postmortem striatum, and it altered
the expression of a subset of PGC1-alpha-regulated genes, particularly
NRF1 (600879). Conditional parkin knockout in mouse led to Pgc1-alpha
and Nrf1 downregulation concomitant with Paris upregulation. Knockout of
Paris expression in parkin-knockout mice reduced the degeneration of
dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Conversely, overexpression of Paris in
substantia nigra of wildtype mice resulted in degeneration of DA neurons
and reduced expression of Pgcl1-alpha and Nrf1. Shin et al. (2011)
concluded that PARIS is predominantly expressed in the nigrostriatal
pathway and may contribute to the pathophysiology of PD.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the ZNF746 gene to chromosome 7q36.1 based on an
alignment of the ZNF746 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK055975) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

605431	TITLE *605431 MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE 8-INTERACTING PROTEIN 3; MAPK8IP3
;;SUNDAY DRIVER, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 2; SYD2;;
JNK/STRESS-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1; JSAP1;;
JNK-INTERACTING PROTEIN 3; JIP3
DESCRIPTION Bowman et al. (2000) identified a broadly conserved membrane-associated
protein, which they termed 'sunday driver' (syd), required for the
functional interaction of kinesin I (see 148760) with axonal cargo in
Drosophila. Mutations in syd and the axonal transport motor kinesin I
were found to cause similar phenotypes in Drosophila, including aberrant
accumulations of axonal cargoes. By searching genomic and EST sequence
databases for proteins similar to syd, Bowman et al. (2000) obtained
full-length cDNAs encoding human SYD1 (605430) and mouse Syd2, as well
as partial cDNAs encoding human SYD2 and mouse Syd1. Human SYD1 is 69%
similar to mouse Syd2 and 55% similar to Drosophila syd. The predicted
SYD proteins have a transmembrane region flanked by an N-terminal domain
containing 2 coiled-coil regions and a C-terminal domain containing a
conserved hydrophobic core. Green fluorescent protein-tagged mouse Syd2
localized to tubulovesicular structures that costained for kinesin I and
a marker of the secretory pathway. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis
indicated that Syd2 forms a complex with kinesin I in vivo. Yeast
2-hybrid analysis and in vitro interaction studies revealed that Syd2
directly binds kinesin I via the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain
of kinesin light chain (KLC; 600025). The authors proposed that the SYD
proteins mediate the axonal transport of at least 1 class of vesicles by
interacting directly with KLC.

By performing a yeast 2-hybrid screen with JNK3 (MAPK10; 602897) as
bait, Ito et al. (1999) isolated mouse Syd2, which they termed Jsap1.
Jsap1 preferentially coprecipitated with the JNKs in cotransfected COS-7
cells. The results of a series of experiments suggested that JSAP1
functions as a scaffold protein in the JNK3 cascade.

Kelkar et al. (2000) also cloned mouse Syd2, which they called Jip3.
They determined that Jip3 is a molecular scaffold protein that binds the
protein kinase components of a JNK signaling module and facilitates JNK
activation in cultured cells. Northern blot analysis detected high
levels of Jip3 expression in brain and lower levels in heart and other
tissues. Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that Jip3 is present
in the cytoplasm and accumulates in the growth cones of developing
neurites. The authors concluded that JIP3 is a member of a novel class
of putative MAPK scaffold proteins that may regulate signal transduction
by the JNK pathway.

609405	TITLE *609405 RHO GTPase-ACTIVATING PROTEIN 8; ARHGAP8
;;GTPase-ACTIVATING PROTEIN, RHO, 8;;
BCH DOMAIN-CONTAINING, PROLINE-RICH, AND CDC42GAP-LIKE PROTEIN 1;
BPGAP1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Small GTPases control cell dynamics during growth and development.
Proteins with a GTPase-activating domain (GAP) domain, such as ARHGAP8,
catalyze the conversion of small GTPases from their active, GTP-bound
form to their inactive, GDP-bound form (Lua and Low, 2004).

CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to CDC42GAP (ARHGAP1;
602732), followed by PCR of a mammary carcinoma cell line, Shang et al.
(2003) cloned a splice variant of ARHGAP8, which they designated BPGAP1.
The deduced 433-amino acid protein contains a BNIP2 (603292) and
CDC42GAP homology (BCH) domain, followed by a proline-rich region and a
C-terminal GAP domain with a conserved arginine necessary for catalytic
activity. Database analysis identified 3 possible splice variants
encoding BPGAP1-like proteins that differ in their N-terminal halves.
RT-PCR detected expression of BPGAP1 in all human cell lines and mouse
tissues tested.

Using a candidate gene approach to identify putative tumor suppressors
in a region of chromosome 22 involved in loss of heterozygosity,
Johnstone et al. (2004) identified the ARHGAP8 gene. They characterized
3 different ARHGAP8 transcripts resulting from alternative splicing of
exon 5. The variant containing exon 5 encodes a deduced 464-amino acid
protein with a calculated molecular mass of 53.5 kD. This isoform
contains a putative N-terminal BCH lipid-binding domain, a central
proline-rich SH3 domain-binding motif, and a C-terminal RhoGAP domain
with a conserved catalytic arginine. The variant lacking exon 5 encodes
a protein with a 31-amino acids deletion in the BCH domain, and the
variant with a truncation of exon 5 encodes a protein with a 5-amino
acid deletion in the BCH domain. Northern blot analysis detected ARHGAP8
expression in colon, skeletal muscle, small intestine, stomach, and
testis, with highest expression in kidney and placenta. Johnstone et al.
(2004) also identified mouse Arhgap8. The mouse gene lacks an exon
equivalent to human exon 5 and encodes a 325-amino acid protein that
shares 80% identity with human ARHGAP8. Johnstone et al. (2004) noted
that a mouse gene reported as Arhgap8 by Shan et al. (2003) actually
represents a distinct gene, Prr5 (609406), located immediately
centromeric to Arhgap8.

GENE FUNCTION

Shang et al. (2003) found that BPGAP1 selectively enhanced RhoA (ARHA;
165390) GTPase activity in vitro, although it also interacted strongly
with CDC42 (116952) and RAC1 (602048). Pull-down and
coimmunoprecipitation studies showed that BPGAP1 formed homophilic and
heterophilic complexes with other BCH domain-containing proteins.
Epitope-tagged BPGAP1 induced pseudopodia and increased cell mobility in
a transfected breast cancer cell line. Formation of pseudopodia required
the BCH and GAP domains of BPGAP1, but not the proline-rich region.
BPGAP1-induced pseudopodia formation was differentially inhibited by
coexpression of a constitutively active RhoA mutant or by
dominant-negative mutants of CDC42 and RAC1. A BPGAP1 mutant without the
proline-rich region failed to increase cell migration despite the
induction of pseudopodia.

By protein precipitations and matrix-assisted laser
desorption/ionization mass spectrometry, Lua and Low (2004) found that
BPGAP1 interacted directly with cortactin (EMS1; 164765) in several
human cell lines. Progressive deletion studies indicated that the SH3
domain of cortactin interacted directly with the proline-rich motif at
amino acids 182 to 189 of BPGAP1. Cotransfection of human embryonic 293T
cells with cortactin and BPGAP1 resulted in colocalization of the 2
proteins at the cell periphery and enhanced cell migration. Substitution
of pro184 and pro186 in BPGAP1 with alanines abolished the interaction,
and mutant BPGAP1 failed to facilitate translocation of cortactin to the
periphery or enhance cell migration.

GENE STRUCTURE

Johnstone et al. (2004) determined that the ARHGAP8 gene contains 13
exons and spans 110 kb. Exon 1 is embedded in a CpG island.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Johnstone et al. (2004) mapped the ARHGAP8
gene to chromosome 22q13.31, immediately centromeric to the PRR5 gene.
They mapped the mouse Arhgap8 gene to chromosome 15E2, a region that
shows homology of synteny to human chromosome 22q13.

CD11B
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

A major surface antigen family on human leukocytes includes complement
receptor type 3 (CR3A; also called ITGAM, Mac1, or Mo1), lymphocyte
function-associated (LFA) antigen type 1 (ITGAL; 153370), and p150,95
(ITGAX; 151510). These antigens share a common beta chain (ITGB2;
600065) of 94 kD, linked noncovalently to 1 of 3 alpha chains
distinctive to each. They promote adhesion of granulocytes to each other
and to endothelial cell monolayers. The apparent molecular weight of the
Mo1 alpha chain is 155 to 165 kD, that of the LFA1 alpha subunit is 180
kD, and that of the Leu M5 subunit is 130 to 150 kD. Pierce et al.
(1986) purified human Mo1 to homogeneity from normal granulocytes by
affinity chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) and determined the N-terminal amino acid sequence of its alpha
subunit. The obtained sequence was identical, except for 2 conservative
substitutions, to that of the alpha subunit of Mac1 antigen (Springer et
al., 1985). Furthermore, Pierce et al. (1986) found that the N-terminal
amino acid sequence of the alpha subunit of Mo1 was homologous to the
alpha subunit of IIb/IIIa (607759), a glycoprotein that serves similar
adhesive functions on platelets and is deficient or defective in
Glanzmann thrombasthenia (273800). Patients with a history of recurrent
bacterial infections and an inherited deficiency of all 3 leukocyte
membrane surface antigens are thought to have reduced or absent
synthesis of the common beta subunit of the antigen family; see 116920.

Arnaout et al. (1988) described the isolation and analysis of 2 partial
cDNA clones encoding the alpha subunit of Mo1 in humans and guinea pigs.
A comparison of the coding region of the MO1A gene revealed significant
homology with the carboxyl-terminal portions of the alpha subunits of
fibronectin, vitronectin, and platelet IIb/IIIa receptors.

Corbi et al. (1988) described full-length cDNA clones for the alpha
subunit of Mac1.

Arnaout et al. (1988) reported the complete amino acid sequence as
deduced from cDNA for the human alpha subunit. The protein consists of
1,136 amino acids with a long amino-terminal extracytoplasmic domain, a
26-amino acid hydrophobic transmembrane segment, and a
19-carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain. The alpha subunit is highly
similar in sequence to the alpha subunit of leukocyte p150,95.

MAPPING

By Southern analysis of DNA from hamster-human hybrids, Arnaout et al.
(1988) localized the human MO1A gene to chromosome 16, which has been
shown to contain the ITGAL gene (153370). By in situ hybridization,
Corbi et al. (1988) demonstrated that the genes encoding the alpha
subunits of LFA1 (ITGAL), Mac1, and p150,95 (ITGAX), all of which are
involved in leukocyte adhesion, constitute a cluster on 16p13.1-p11.
Callen et al. (1991) narrowed the assignment to 16p11.2.

GENE FUNCTION

Inflammation plays an essential role in the initiation and progression
of atherosclerosis. Simon et al. (2000) presented evidence that it also
has a role in vascular repair after mechanical arterial injury (i.e.,
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, or PTCA). In animal
models of vascular injury, leukocytes are recruited as a precursor to
intimal thickening. Markers of leukocyte activation, in particular,
increased expression of Mac1, which is responsible for firm leukocyte
adhesion to platelets and fibrinogen on denuded vessels, predict
restenosis after PTCA. To determine whether Mac1-mediated leukocyte
recruitment is causally related to neointimal formation, Simon et al.
(2000) subjected Mac1 knockout mice to a mechanical carotid artery
dilation and complete endothelial denudation. They found that the
selective absence of Mac1 impaired transplatelet leukocyte migration
into the vessel wall, reducing leukocyte accumulation. Diminished medial
leukocyte accumulation was accompanied by markedly reduced neointimal
thickening after vascular injury. These data established a role for
inflammation in neointimal thickening and suggested that leukocyte
recruitment to mechanically injured arteries may prevent restenosis.

Ranganathan et al. (2011) noted that previous work (Cao et al., 2006)
had shown colocalization of low density lipoprotein receptor-related
protein-1 (LRP1; 107770) with integrin alpha-M/beta-2 at the trailing
edge of migrating macrophages and that macrophage migration depended
upon coordinated action of LRP1 and alpha-M/beta-2, as well as tissue
plasminogen activator (PLAT; 173370) and its inhibitor, PAI1 (SERPINE1;
173360). Ranganathan et al. (2011) found that LRP1 specifically bound
integrin alpha-M/beta-2, but not integrin alpha-L/beta-2. Activation of
alpha-M/beta-2 by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) enhanced interaction between
LRP1 and alpha-M/beta-2 in macrophages. Transfection experiments in
HEK293 cells revealed that both the heavy and light chains of LRP1
contributed to alpha-M/beta-2 binding. Within the LRP1 heavy chain,
binding was mediated primarily via ligand-binding motifs 2 and 4. Within
alpha-M, the sequence EQLKKSKTL within the I domain was the major LRP1
recognition site. Exposure of alpha-M/beta-2-expressing HEK293 cells to
soluble LRP1 inhibited cell attachment to fibrinogen (see 134820). Mouse
macrophages lacking Lrp1 were deficient in alpha-M/beta-2
internalization upon LPS stimulation. Ranganathan et al. (2011)
concluded that LRP1 has a role in macrophage migration and that it is
critical for internalization of integrin alpha-M/beta-2.

;;ACID FINGER PROTEIN; AFP;;
ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 173, FORMERLY; ZNF173, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chu et al. (1995) performed positional cloning of short fragment cDNA
sequences from the class I region of the human major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) using a hybridization selection approach. They isolated
full-length cDNA clones and partial genomic clones encoding a protein
with 2 domains rich in cysteine and histidine similar to those
characteristic of metal-dependent DNA-binding proteins. The predicted
protein also contains a domain thought to form a coiled-coil, possibly
to promote dimerization. A third feature of the predicted protein is a
polyglutamic acid region near the carboxyl terminus. Because of these
properties, Chu et al. (1995) named the gene product acid-finger
protein, AFP (a designation used originally for alpha-fetoprotein (AFP;
104150)). Although the biologic role of AFP was unknown, one potential
function was binding of nucleic acids. The gene was expressed in
multiple tissues and conserved among mammals. In particular, the mouse
and human coding regions were highly conserved.

MAPPING

Chu et al. (1995) identified the AFP gene within the MHC on chromosome
6. It appeared that multiple AFP-like genes existed in this region of
the MHC.

;;TRANSDUCIN-BETA-LIKE 1; TBL1;;
EBI, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF; EBI
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TBL1X is an intrinsic component of the nuclear corepressor (NCOR)
complex (see NCOR1; 600849). TBL1X also acts as a specific adaptor that
recruits the ubiquitin-conjugating (see 602961)/19S proteasome (see
154365) complex that mediates the exchange of corepressors for
coactivators (Perissi et al., 2008).

CLONING

In the course of constructing a deletion map of the distal portion of
the short arm of the X chromosome and the identification of GPR143
(300808), the gene mutant in OA1 (300500), Bassi et al. (1999) performed
cDNA selection experiments that resulted in the isolation of a novel
gene, TBL1, located outside the OA1 critical region on the telomeric
side. The TBL1 gene maps to the Xp22.3 region and shares significant
homology with members of the WD40 repeat-containing protein family. The
open reading frame encodes a 526-amino acid protein containing 6
beta-transducin repeats (WD40 motif) in the C-terminal domain. The
homology with known beta-subunits of G proteins and other WD40
repeat-containing proteins is restricted to the WD40 motif. Northern
blot analysis indicated that the TBL1 gene is ubiquitously expressed as
2 transcripts of approximately 2.1 and 6.0 kb.

Dong et al. (1999) reported that the Drosophila eb1 gene is conserved in
a number of species, including humans. Sequence analysis using the human
EB1 sequence reported by Dong et al. (1999) revealed identity with a
51-amino acid stretch in the N-terminal F box of TBL1 (Converse, 2001).

GENE FUNCTION

Matsuzawa and Reed (2001) elucidated a network of protein interactions
in which SIAH1 (602212), SIP (606186), SKP1 (601434), and EBI
collaborate in a pathway controlling beta-catenin (116806) levels,
affecting activity of beta-catenin-dependent TCF (e.g., TCF1; 142410)
and LEF (e.g., LEF1; 153245) transcription factors. This pathway is
inducible by p53 (191170), revealing a link between genotoxic injury
responses and beta-catenin degradation. SIAH1 is physically linked to
EBI by association with SIP, which binds SKP1.

Using database mining and protein structural prediction programs, Emes
and Ponting (2001) identified a sequence motif in the products of genes
mutated in Miller-Dieker lissencephaly (LIS1; 601545), Treacher Collins
(TCOF1, treacle; 606847), and oral-facial-digital type 1 (CXORF5;
300170) syndromes, as well as in TBL1, which is deleted in patients with
the contiguous syndrome ocular albinism with late onset sensorineural
deafness (OASD; 300650). Over 100 eukaryotic intracellular proteins were
found to possess a LIS1 homology motif, including several katanin p60
(606696) subunits, muskelin (605623), Nopp140 (602394), the plant
proteins tonneau and LEUNIG, slime mold protein aimless, and numerous WD
repeat-containing beta-propeller proteins. The authors suggested that
LIS1 homology motifs may contribute to the regulation of microtubule
dynamics, either by mediating dimerization, or else by binding
cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain (600112) or microtubules directly. The
predicted secondary structure of LIS1 homology motifs, and their
occurrence in homologs of G-beta beta-propeller subunits, suggests that
they are analogs of G-gamma subunits, and might associate with the
periphery of beta-propeller domains. The finding of LIS1 homology motifs
in both treacle and Nopp140 reinforces previous observations of
functional similarities between these nucleolar proteins.

Zhang et al. (2002) reported that GPS2 (601935), a protein involved in
intracellular signaling, is an integral subunit of the NCOR1-HDAC3
(605166) complex. They determined structural motifs that direct the
formation of a highly stable and active deacetylase complex. GPS2 and
TBL1, another component of the NCOR1-HDAC3 complex, interact
cooperatively with repression domain-1 of NCOR1 to form a heterotrimeric
structure and are indirectly linked to HDAC3 via an extended NCOR1 SANT
domain that also activates latent HDAC3 activity. Zhang et al. (2002)
also showed that the NCOR1-HDAC3 complex inhibits JNK (601158)
activation through the associated GPS2 subunit and thus could
potentially provide an alternative mechanism for hormone-mediated
antagonism of AP1 (165160) function.

Yoon et al. (2003) purified NCOR complexes, which contained 10 to 12
proteins, from HeLa cell nuclear extracts and characterized the
interactions of TBL1 and TBLR1 (608628) with NCOR. TBL1 and TBLR1
interacted with NCOR through 2 independent interactions. Their
N-terminal regions interacted with the RD1 region of NCOR, and their
C-terminal WD40 repeats interacted with the RD4 region of NCOR. In
vitro, TBL1 and TBLR1 also bound histones H2B (see 609904) and H4 (see
602822), and transcriptional repression by TBL1 and TBLR1 correlated
with their interactions with histones. Using small interfering RNAs,
Yoon et al. (2003) demonstrated that HDAC3 was essential for repression
by unliganded thyroid hormone receptor. TBL1 and TBLR1 were also
essential, but they were functionally redundant.

Perissi et al. (2004) reported that transcriptional activation mediated
by liganded nuclear receptors requires the actions of 2 highly related F
box/WD40-containing factors, TBL1 and TBLR1. TBL1 and TBLR1 serve as
specific adaptors for recruitment of the ubiquitin-conjugating/19S
proteasome complex, with TBLR1 selectively serving to mediate a required
exchange of the nuclear receptor corepressors, NCOR and SMRT (600848),
for coactivators upon ligand binding. Tbl1 gene deletion in murine
embryonic stem cells severely impaired PPARG (601487)-induced adipogenic
differentiation, indicating that TBL1 function is biologically
indispensable for specific nuclear receptor-mediated gene activation
events. The role of TBLR1 and TBL1 in cofactor exchange also appeared to
operate for JUN (165160) and NFKB (see 164011), suggesting it is likely
to be prototypic of similar mechanisms for other signal-dependent
transcription factors.

Perissi et al. (2008) found that a large number of regulated
transcription factors required both TBL1 and TBLR1 to simultaneously
overcome the repressive functions of CTBP1 (602618)/CTBP2 (602619) and
NCOR/SMRT corepressor complexes, respectively. TBL1 was specifically
required to mediate ubiquitination and degradation of CTBP. Although
TBL1 and TBLR1 share a high degree of amino acid identity, the
specificity of their activities was regulated by phosphorylation at
nonhomologous sites. This phosphorylation was induced by receptor
ligands and occurred on TBL1 and TBLR1 prebound to regulated promoters.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bassi et al. (1999) found that the TBL1 gene contains 18 exons spanning
approximately 150 kb adjacent to the OA1 gene. Unlike OA1, TBL1 is
transcribed from telomere to centromere.

MAPPING

By FISH and interspecific backcross analysis, Disteche et al. (1998)
mapped the Tbl1 gene to the mouse X chromosome. The findings indicated
the presence of a previously unrecognized rearrangement between human
and mouse X chromosomes that involves the distal end of the short arm of
human X. Indeed, in the human, TBL1, OA1, and APXL (300103) are located
very close to each other in Xp22.3, spanning a genomic region of
approximately 400 kb. Mapping of their mouse homologs revealed 2 novel
rearrangements, with Oa1 and Apx1 still close to each other in
chromosome band F2-3 but Tbl1 located much more proximally in chromosome
bands B-C.

CYTOGENETICS

By genomic analysis, Bassi et al. (1999) found that the TBL1 gene was
either partly or entirely deleted in patients carrying Xp22.3 terminal
deletions. The complexity of the contiguous gene syndrome phenotype
shared by these patients was dependent on the number of known disease
genes involved in the deletions. One patient carrying a
microinterstitial deletion involving the 3-prime portion of both the
TBL1 and OA1 genes showed the OA1 phenotype associated with X-linked
late-onset sensorineural deafness. Bassi et al. (1999) postulated an
involvement of TBL1 in the pathogenesis of ocular albinism with
late-onset sensorineural deafness phenotype.

602916	TITLE *602916 UBIQUITIN-CONJUGATING ENZYME E2E 1; UBE2E1
;;UBIQUITIN-CONJUGATING ENZYME UBCH6; UBCH6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ubiquitin system plays a major role in selective protein
degradation. This pathway first requires the covalent attachment of
ubiquitin, a highly conserved 76-amino acid protein, to defined lysine
residues of substrate proteins. Ubiquitin-protein conjugates are then
recognized and degraded by a specific protease complex, the 26 S
proteasome. Protein ubiquitination involves 3 classes of enzymes: the
ubiquitin-activating enzymes E1 (e.g., UBE1; 314370), the
ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes E2, and the ubiquitin-protein ligases E3
(e.g., UBE3A; 601623). One evolutionarily conserved subfamily of E2s
includes human UBCH5A (UBE2D1; 602961), S. cerevisiae UBC4 and UBC5, and
Arabidopsis thaliana UBC8.

CLONING

By RT-PCR using degenerate oligonucleotides corresponding to highly
conserved regions of S. cerevisiae UBC4 and A. thaliana UBC8, Nuber et
al. (1996) cloned human cDNAs encoding UBE2E1, which they called UBCH6.
They noted that the isolated cDNAs may not contain the complete UBCH6
coding sequence since an in-frame stop codon was not found upstream of
the first methionine codon. The deduced 193-amino acid UBCH6 protein
shows the highest sequence similarity to members of the UBCH5 E2
subfamily, with 74% similarity to UBCH5. UBCH6 appears unique among
these E2s in containing an N-terminal extension of approximately 40
amino acids.

GENE FUNCTION

Nuber et al. (1996) found that UBCH6 did not efficiently mediate UBE3A
(E6AP)-dependent ubiquitination in an in vitro assay.

;;GUANYLATE CYCLASE-ACTIVATING PROTEIN, PHOTORECEPTOR 1; GCAP1;;
GUANYLIN 1, RETINA; GUCA1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Guanylate cyclase-activating protein is a novel Ca(2+)-binding protein
that stimulates synthesis of cGMP in photoreceptors. By molecular
cloning of human and mouse GCAP cDNA, Subbaraya et al. (1994) found that
the known mammalian GCAPs are more than 90% similar, consisting of 201
to 205 amino acids, and containing 3 identically conserved
Ca(2+)-binding sites. The sequence homology with recoverin (179618), a
related photoreceptor Ca(2+)-binding protein, was less than 35%. In situ
hybridization in primate retinas showed that the GUCA1 gene is expressed
exclusively in photoreceptor inner segments. Subbaraya et al. (1994)
found that the GUCA1 gene has been well conserved during evolution of
vertebrate species.

By Northern blot analysis, Surguchov et al. (1997) showed that the
GUCA1A gene, termed GCAP1 by the authors, is transcribed into a single
1.7-kb mRNA species detectable only in the retina.

GENE STRUCTURE

Subbaraya et al. (1994) found that the human GUCA1 gene spans
approximately 6 kb and consists of 4 exons separated by 3 introns.

MAPPING

Using human/hamster hybrid panels and fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Subbaraya et al. (1994) localized the GUCA1 gene to
6p21.1.

Surguchov et al. (1997) found that GUCA1A is located in a tail-to-tail
array with GUCA1B (602275).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a 4-generation British family with typical clinical features of
autosomal dominant cone dystrophy (COD3; 602093), Payne et al. (1998)
identified a tyr99-to-cys mutation (Y99C; 600364.0001) in the GUCA1A
gene. Linkage analysis in this family excluded all the known cone and
cone-rod dystrophy loci, except the 6p21.1 region. This region is known
to contain the RDS gene (179605), which is associated with dominant
cone-rod dystrophy. Screening of the RDS gene by heteroduplex analysis
and direct sequencing failed to demonstrate sequence changes in the
coding region of this gene.

Michaelides et al. (2005) reported a 4-generation family with the Y99C
substitution causing cone, cone-rod, and macular dystrophies.

Downes et al. (2001) reported a family with a pro50-to-leu mutation
(600364.0002) in GUCA1A, who demonstrated phenotypic variability ranging
from mild photophobia to rod-cone dystrophy. Newbold et al. (2001)
determined that the mutant protein could activate guanylate cyclase 1
(GUCY2D; 600179), displayed similar calcium sensitivity to wildtype
protein, and possessed a CD spectrum similar to that of wildtype GUCA1A.
However, there was a marked increase in the susceptibility to protease
degradation and also a reduction in the thermal stability of the
pro50-to-leu mutation. The authors hypothesized that the lower stability
could reduce its cellular concentration, which would in turn alter
Ca(2+) and result in death of retinal cells.

ANIMAL MODEL

Through studies in transgenic mice, Pennesi et al. (2003) found that,
similar to rods, deletion of Gcap1 and Gcap2 delayed the recovery of
light responses in cones and Gcap1 restored the recovery of cone
responses in the absence of Gcap2.

In all 27 affected individuals in a 4-generation British family with

resulted in a tyr99-to-cys (Y99C) substitution.

Sokal et al. (1998) demonstrated that the tyr99-to-cys mutant and native
GCAP1 are highly effective in stimulation of photoreceptor GC1. The
Ca(2+) sensitivity of the mutant GCAP1, however, was markedly altered,
causing reduced but persistent stimulation of GC1 under physiologic dark
conditions. These results were consistent with a model in which enhanced
GC activity in dark-adapted cones leads to elevated levels of
cytoplasmic cGMP. Alterations in physiologic cGMP levels are also
associated with other retinal degenerations, including Leber congenital
amaurosis (see 204000).

Dizhoor et al. (1998) found that the Y99C mutation causes constitutive
activation of GC1 within the whole physiologically relevant range of
free calcium concentrations.

Michaelides et al. (2005) reported a 4-generation British family in
which affected individuals presented with cone dystrophy, cone-rod
dystrophy (CORD14, see 602093), or isolated macular dysfunction. The
Y99C mutation was found in all affected individuals.

CONE DYSTROPHY 3
GUCA1A, PRO50LEU

Downes et al. (2001) performed psychophysical and electrophysiologic
evaluation and confocal laser scanning ophthalmoscopy on a family with
autosomal cone dystrophy (COD3; 602093) and a pro50-to-leu mutation in
GUCA1A. Affected individuals demonstrated marked variability in
phenotype, ranging from mild photophobia to cone-rod dystrophy.

CONE-ROD DYSTROPHY 14
CONE DYSTROPHY 3, INCLUDED
GUCA1A, LEU151PHE

In a family with autosomal dominant cone-rod dystrophy (CORD14, see
602093), Sokal et al. (2005) identified a C-to-T transition in exon 4 of
the GUCA1A gene, resulting in a leu151-to-phe (L151F) substitution in
the EF4 hand domain. The mutation was found in 12 affected family
members but not in 11 unaffected family members or 100 controls.
Affected family members experienced dyschromatopsia, hemeralopia, and
reduced visual acuity by the second to third decade of life. The
clinical phenotype was characterized by early cone dysfunction and a
progressive loss of rod function as shown by electrophysiology, which
revealed a nonrecordable photopic response with later attenuation of the
scotopic response. The biochemical phenotype was best described as
persistent stimulation of photoreceptor guanylate cyclase, representing
a gain of function of mutant GUCA1A. Although a conservative
substitution, molecular dynamics suggested a significant change in
calcium binding to the EF4 and EF2 domains and changes in the shape of
the L151 mutant.

In a 5-generation family with autosomal dominant cone dystrophy (COD3;
602093), Jiang et al. (2005) identified the L151F mutation. Sokal et al.
(2005) commented that the reason for the discrepancy in phenotype was
unclear.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) is a multisubunit complex that mediates
acidification of intracellular organelles. By large-scale sequencing of
a human fetal brain cDNA library and database searching, Fujiwara et al.
(1995) identified a sequence showing homology with the 14-kD subunit of
M. sexta V-ATPase. Using 5-prime RACE, they cloned a full-length cDNA
encoding a deduced 119-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 14
kD. The protein is predominantly hydrophilic and shares 69% and 70%
sequence identity with the M. sexta and Drosophila homologs,
respectively. Northern blot analysis detected ubiquitous expression of a
0.8-kb transcript.

;;PROTEIN-TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE, T-CELL; PTPT
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The phosphorylation of proteins at tyrosine is an important regulatory
component in signal transduction, neoplastic transformation, and the
control of the mitotic cycle. As in systems regulated by serine or
threonine phosphorylation, the phosphorylation of proteins at tyrosine
is reversible. The reaction is catalyzed by protein-tyrosine
phosphatases (PTPases; protein-tyrosine phosphate phosphohydrolase; EC
3.1.3.48). These enzymes appear to be highly specific for phosphotyrosyl
proteins and bear little resemblance to either the protein-serine
phosphatases or protein-threonine phosphatases or the acid and alkaline
phosphatases. Cool et al. (1989) cloned PTPN2, which they called PTPT.
The deduced protein shares 72% amino acid identity with PTP1B (PTPN1;
176885) in a 236-amino acid core region present in all PTPases.

GENE STRUCTURE

Todd et al. (2007) noted that PTPN2 contains 10 exons.

MAPPING

Sakaguchi et al. (1991, 1992) used a human PTPT cDNA to assign the gene
to human chromosome 18 and mouse chromosome 18 by Southern analysis of
human/mouse and mouse/Chinese hamster somatic cell hybrids,
respectively.

Johnson et al. (1993) mapped the PTPN2 gene to 18p11.3-p11.2 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. They identified pseudogenes on
1q22-q24 and 13q12-q13.

GENE FUNCTION

Kleppe et al. (2010) described the identification of focal deletions of
PTPN2 in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Deletion of
PTPN2 was specifically found in T-ALLs with aberrant expression of the
TLX1 transcription factor oncogene (186770), including 4 cases also
expressing the NUP214-ABL1 tyrosine kinase (114350). Knockdown of PTPN2
increased the proliferation and cytokine sensitivity of T-ALL cells. In
addition, PTPN2 was identified as a negative regulator of NUP214-ABL1
kinase activity. Kleppe et al. (2010) concluded that their study
provided genetic and functional evidence for a tumor suppressor role of
PTPN2 and suggested that expression of PTPN2 may modulate response to
treatment.

Colli et al. (2010) evaluated whether modulation of MDA5 (IFIH1; 606951)
and PTPN2, 2 candidate genes for type 1 diabetes (222100), affects
beta-cell responses to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a by-product of
viral replication. INS-1E cells and primary fluorescence-activated cell
sorting-purified rat beta-cells were transfected with small interference
RNAs (siRNAs) targeting MDA5 or PTPN2 and subsequently exposed to
intracellular synthetic dsRNA polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (PIC). PIC
increased MDA5 and PTPN2 mRNA expression, which was inhibited by the
specific siRNAs. PIC triggered apoptosis in INS-1E and primary
beta-cells and this was augmented by PTPN2 knockdown, although
inhibition of MDA5 did not modify PIC-induced apoptosis. In contrast,
MDA5 silencing decreased PIC-induced cytokine and chemokine expression,
although inhibition of PTPN2 induced minor or no changes in these
inflammatory mediators. Colli et al. (2010) concluded that changes in
MDA5 and PTPN2 expression modify beta-cell responses to dsRNA. MDA5
regulates inflammatory signals, whereas PTPN2 may function as a defense
mechanism against proapoptotic signals generated by dsRNA.

inflammatory bowel disease, see IBD21 (612354).

603131	TITLE *603131 PEPTIDASE, MITOCHONDRIAL PROCESSING, BETA; PMPCB
;;MITOCHONDRIAL PROCESSING PEPTIDASE-BETA; MPPB
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Mao et al. (1998) cloned and sequenced a human mitochondrial processing
peptidase-beta (MPPB) cDNA. The 1,772-bp cDNA encodes a protein of 489
amino acids. The protein sequence shows homology with the sequence of
rat Mppb (Paces et al., 1993).

GENE FUNCTION

Using the yeast 2-hybrid assay to detect protein-protein interactions
(Fields and Song, 1989), Koutnikova et al. (1998) identified MPPB as a
frataxin protein partner. Frataxin (FXN; 606829) is the gene product
that is deficient or defective in Friedreich ataxia (FRDA; 229300). In
in vitro assays, MPPB bound frataxin, which was cleaved by the
reconstituted MPP heterodimer. MPP cleavage of frataxin resulted in an
intermediate form, comprising amino acids 41 to 210, which was processed
further to the mature form. In vitro and in vivo experiments suggested
that 2 C-terminal missense mutations found in FRDA patients, I151F
(229300.0004) and G130V (229300.0005), modulated interaction with
MPP-beta, resulting in a slower maturation process at the normal
cleavage site. The slower processing rate of frataxin carrying such
missense mutations may therefore contribute to frataxin deficiency, in
addition to an impairment of its function. Similar studies were reported
by Gordon et al. (1999), with conflicting results. They performed in
vitro experiments with MPP, wildtype and I154F (229300.0004) human
frataxin or its mutant yeast homolog, and purified mammalian or yeast
mitochondria. These authors concluded that MPP was capable of 1-step
processing of frataxin to the mature form, and that the I154F mutation
had no effect on mitochondrial import and/or maturation of frataxin.

MAPPING

The MPPB gene is on a BAC contig in the chromosome 7q22-q31.1 region
(GenBank GENBANK AC004668).

602701	TITLE *602701 SARCOLEMMAL-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; SLMAP
;;SLAP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Wigle et al. (1997) screened a rabbit heart cDNA expression library with
anti-sarcolemmal antibodies and isolated a novel cDNA encoding
sarcolemmal associated protein (SLAP). Three alternately spliced
isoforms, termed SLAP1, SLAP2, and SLAP3, differing at their 5-prime
ends, were identified. The 3 cDNAs predicted proteins of 322, 402, and
639 amino acids, with predicted masses of 37, 46, and 74 kD,
respectively. Each of the predicted proteins contained a putative
transmembrane domain at its carboxy-terminal tail and 2 potential
leucine zipper motifs. SLAP showed extended low-level homology with
myosins and other coiled-coil proteins. Northern blot analysis of rabbit
tissues revealed 3 mRNAs of 5.9, 4.5, and 3.5 kb, each with a distinct
pattern of expression. Immunostaining of rat heart tissue sections
demonstrated that SLAP had a reticular pattern of expression in the
sarcolemma.

Wigle et al. (1997) isolated a 2.4-kb human SLAP clone from a cardiac
cDNA library.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Wigle et al. (1997) mapped the
human SLAP gene to chromosome 3p21.2-p14.3.

300482	TITLE *300482 GRB2-ASSOCIATED BINDING PROTEIN 3; GAB3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to GAB1 (604439),
followed by screening dendritic cell and eosinophil cDNA libraries, Wolf
et al. (2002) cloned GAB3. The deduced 586-amino acid protein contains
an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and potential SH2- and
SH3-binding motifs. The PH domains of GAB1, GAB2 (606203), and GAB3
share about 50% amino acid identity, while the remainder of the proteins
share about 14% identity. Wolf et al. (2002) also cloned mouse Gab3,
which encodes a deduced 595-amino acid protein. RT-PCR detected mouse
Gab3 expressed at high levels in spleen and thymus and at lower levels
in brain, heart, lung, kidney, uterus, and embryonic stem cells, but not
in other tissues examined. Gab3 was expressed in all myeloid and
macrophage cell lines examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Wolf et al. (2002) examined the role of Gab3 in macrophage
differentiation and signal transduction using a mouse myeloid progenitor
cell line exogenously expressing Fms (164770), the receptor for
macrophage colony-stimulating factor (MCSF; 120420). Gab3 was tyrosine
phosphorylated following receptor stimulation, and it associated
transiently with the SH2 domain-containing proteins Shp2 (176876) and
p85 of the PI3K complex (see 171833). Overexpression of exogenous Gab3
dramatically accelerated macrophage differentiation upon MCSF
stimulation. Examination of phosphorylation mutants suggested that Gab3
is important for macrophage differentiation and that differentiation
requires the early phosphorylation of Gab2, followed by induction and
subsequent phosphorylation of Gab3.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the GAB3
gene to chromosome X (TMAP RH80611).

ANIMAL MODEL

Seiffert et al. (2003) found normal hematopoiesis in mice lacking Gab3,
and macrophages developed in normal numbers and exhibited normal
function. Gab3-deficient mice had no major immune deficiency in T- and
B-lymphocyte responses to protein antigens or during viral infection.
Allergic responses also appeared normal.

182465	TITLE *182465 SON DNA-BINDING PROTEIN; SON
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SON is a nuclear speckle-localized protein that shares homology with
pre-mRNA splicing accessory factors (Wynn et al., 2000).

CLONING

Berdichevskii et al. (1988) cloned a fragment designated Son3 from a
human embryonic cDNA bank. The nucleotide sequence was found to be 1,454
bp long with 6 possible open reading frames, only 1 of which did not
contain terminating codons. Translation of that open reading frame into
an amino acid sequence and database analysis showed that the Son3 region
codes for a protein with the following distinctive features: (1) the
presence of a cluster of short tandem repeats from 7 to 19 amino acids
long, located in the central part of the sequence; (2) the presence of
lengthy regions of homology with certain DNA-binding structural
proteins, such as gallin (55%), and also with oncoproteins encoded by
protooncogenes of the MYC family; and (3) the presence of a region of
homology with an oncoprotein encoded by the MOS protooncogene (190060).

Wynn et al. (2000) independently identified human SON, which shares
84.2% amino acid identity with its mouse homolog. SON has a basic
serine/arginine-rich C-terminal domain that shares homology with
proteins involved in mRNA processing. Immunofluorescence studies
localized endogenous SON to interchromatin granules of the interphase
nucleus in human epithelial cells. The nuclear speckled staining pattern
was similar to that observed with mRNA splicing factors, suggesting that
SON may play a role in mRNA processing.

GENE FUNCTION

From a human keratinocyte cDNA library, Khan et al. (1994) isolated a
clone for the DNA-binding protein SON. Using this clone, they found that
the SON gene is expressed in various cell types and that homologous
sequences can be detected in vertebrate and insect genomic DNA.

Using a combination of proteomics, cytology, and functional analysis in
C. elegans, Chu et al. (2006) reduced 1,099 proteins copurified with
spermatogenic chromatin to 132 proteins for functional analysis. This
strategy to find fertility factors conserved from C. elegans to mammals
achieved its goal: of mouse gene knockouts corresponding to nematode
proteins, 37% (7 of 19) cause male sterility. This list includes PPP1CC
(176914), H2AX (601772), SON, TOP1 (126420), DDX4 (605281), DBY
(400010), and CENPC (117141).

Karlas et al. (2010) reported the discovery of 287 human host cell genes
influencing influenza A virus replication, including SON, in a
genomewide RNA interference screen. Using an independent assay, Karlas
et al. (2010) confirmed 168 hits (59%) inhibiting either the endemic
HIN1 (119 hits) or the pandemic swine-origin (121 hits) influenza A
virus strains, with an overlap of 60%. SON was found to be important for
normal trafficking of influenza virions to late endosomes early in
infection.

GENE STRUCTURE

Slavov et al. (2000) predicted that the SON gene contains 10 exons
spanning 25 kb. Wynn et al. (2000) determined that the SON gene contains
12 exons.

MAPPING

Using PCR to amplify SON sequences from a panel of somatic cell hybrids,
Khan et al. (1994) assigned the human SON gene to chromosome 21. By use
of hybrids containing regions of chromosome 21, the localization was
refined to 21q22.1-q22.2.

Wynn et al. (2000) determined that both human and mouse SON and DONSON
(611428) are in tail-to-tail orientation and in the following order:
GART (138440)-SON-DONSON.

611030	TITLE *611030 TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN 30C; TMEM30C
;;CDC50, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF, C; CDC50C
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases for homologs of yeast Cdc50 family proteins,
which are involved in polarized cell division, Katoh and Katoh (2004)
identified 3 human CDC50 genes, including TMEM30C, which they called
CDC50C. The predicted CDC50C protein contains 341 amino acids. The human
and yeast CDC50 proteins all have 2 transmembrane domains and an
extracellular loop with 3 cysteines and an N-glycosylation site.

Osada et al. (2007) obtained TMEM30C cDNAs by 3-prime RACE of human and
chimpanzee testis RNA. In both species, the TMEM30C transcripts were
truncated due to mutations in splicing or poly(A) signals relative to
the macaque gene, which encodes 2 splice variants derived from 7 or 8
exons that produce proteins with 1 or 2 transmembrane domains,
respectively. In contrast, the major human transcript originates from 3
exons and lacks a stop codon, suggesting it does not produce a
functional protein. A minor human transcript transcribed from 2 exons
encodes a predicted 113-amino acid protein with 1 transmembrane domain.
RT-PCR showed that TMEM30C was expressed exclusively in testis of human,
macaque, and mouse. Expression of exons 5 through 8 in human and exons 6
through 8 in chimpanzee was not detected, suggesting that the
2-transmembrane form of TMEM30C is dispensable in hominoids.

GENE STRUCTURE

Katoh and Katoh (2004) determined that the TMEM30C gene contains 7
exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Katoh and Katoh (2004) mapped the TMEM30C
gene to chromosome 3q12.

EVOLUTION

By phylogenetic analysis, Osada et al. (2007) showed that an accelerated
rate of amino acid substitutions in TMEM30C occurred after the
divergence of chimps and humans from Old World monkeys. They suggested
that the excess of substitutions might result from positive selection
for a new function or, more likely, relaxation of selection, as occurs
in pseudogenes.

606730	TITLE *606730 OXYSTEROL-BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE PROTEIN 1A; OSBPL1A
;;OSBP-RELATED PROTEIN 1; ORP1;;
OSBPL1B
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

OSBPL1A is a member of the OSBP family of intracellular lipid receptors.
For background information on OSBPs, see OSBP2 (606729).

CLONING

By EST database searching for sequences homologous to OSBP (167040),
followed by RT-PCR, Laitinen et al. (1999) identified 6 OSBP-related
proteins, including OSBPL1A, which they called ORP1. Northern blot
analysis revealed expression of a 3.6-kb ORP1 transcript in all tissues
tested, with greatest abundance in brain, heart, skeletal muscle, and
kidney. Endogenous expression in a neuroblastoma cell line was
upregulated by exposure to low density lipoprotein. Similar treatment on
a hepatocellular carcinoma cell line did not result in significant
alterations in ORP1 mRNA levels.

Xu et al. (2001) cloned ORP1 by database searching and multiple rounds
of cDNA library screening. ORP1 encodes a deduced 437-amino acid
protein. Yeast complementation assays indicated that ORP1 is a
counterpart of yeast Kes1. Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated
expression of ORP1 in the cytosol.

Lehto et al. (2001) used RT-PCR analysis with specific primers to
isolate a full-length cDNA encoding a long variant of ORP1. Sequence
analysis predicted that the 950-amino acid protein contains a C-terminal
sterol-binding (SB) domain of approximately 400 residues that includes
the OSBP motif (EQVSHHPP). The N terminus contains 3 ankyrin-like
repeats and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. This long variant is
referred to as OSBPL1B, and its C terminus is nearly identical to the
437-amino acid variant, OSBPL1A, reported by Xu et al. (2001). OSBPL1B
is most homologous to OSBPL2 (606731), with 85% identity in their SB
domains.

Jaworski et al. (2001) cloned multiple OSBPs, including OSBPL1A and
OSBPL1B. They determined that the OSBPL1A protein does not have a PH
domain. RT-PCR analysis detected ubiquitous expression of OSBPL1B,
whereas expression of OSBPL1A was restricted to retina, brain, pineal
gland, fetal brain, and cultured retinal pigment epithelial cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Binding analysis by Xu et al. (2001) showed strongest binding of ORP1 to
phosphatidic acid, with weaker binding to cardiolipin and
phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate.

GENE STRUCTURE

By database analysis, Lehto et al. (2001) determined that the ORP1 gene
contains 28 exons. Jaworski et al. (2001) determined that the OSBPL1A
variant is encoded by 13 exons, while the OSBPL1B variant is encoded by
28 exons.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Lehto et al. (2001) mapped the OSBPL1A gene to
chromosome 18. Jaworski et al. (2001) refined the localization to
18q11-q12.

182175	TITLE *182175 SIGNAL RECOGNITION PARTICLE, 19-KD; SRP19
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The signal recognition particle (SRP) is a ribonucleoprotein complex
that mediates the targeting of proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER). The complex consists of a 7S (or 7SL) RNA and 6 different
proteins, SRP9 (600707), SRP14 (600708), SRP19, SRP54 (604857), SRP68
(604858), and SRP72 (602122). The proteins are bound to the 7S RNA as
monomers (SRP19 and SRP54) or heterodimers (SRP9/SRP14 and SRP68/SRP72).
SRP9 and SRP14 bind to the Alu domain of the SRP, whereas the other 4
proteins belong to the S domain. SRP has at least 3 distinct functions
that can be associated with the protein subunits: signal recognition,
translational arrest, and ER membrane targeting by interaction with the
docking protein.

For information on a signal recognition particle database, see Larsen et
al. (1998).

By screening a liver cDNA library with an anti-SRP19 probe, Lingelbach
et al. (1988) isolated a human SRP19 cDNA encoding a 144-amino acid
protein. Sequence analysis showed that SRP19 contains a very basic
C-terminal domain of 7 lysine residues interrupted by 2 glycine
residues. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a 0.9 kb
transcript in HeLa cells. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that SRP19 is
expressed as a 19-kD protein, identical in size to canine SRP19.
Functional analysis determined that the SRP19 protein binds to 7SL RNA
in canine pancreas.

GENE STRUCTURE

Groden et al. (1991) determined that the SRP19 gene consists of 5 exons.

GENE FUNCTION

In 2 small nested deletions of 100 to 260 kb identified by Joslyn et al.
(1991) in patients with adenomatous polyposis coli (APC; 175100), Groden
et al. (1991) identified 3 genes in a span of about 100 kb on chromosome
5. One of these was DP1 (125265); a second was the gene that is mutant
in APC, called by them DP2.5 (611731). The third was a gene which was
found to have the same sequence as that of SRP19. Horii et al. (1993)
discussed the occurrence of alternative splicing not only within the APC
gene but also between the APC gene and the neighboring SRP19 gene.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Wild et al. (2001) reported the 1.8-angstrom resolution crystal
structure of human SRP19 in complex with its primary binding site on
helix 6 of SRP RNA, which consists of a stem-loop structure closed by an
unusual GGAG tetraloop. Protein-RNA interactions are mediated by the
specific recognition of a widened major groove and the tetraloop without
any direct protein-base contacts and include a complex network of highly
ordered water molecules. Wild et al. (2001) proposed a model of the
assembly of the SRP core comprising SRP19, SRP54, and SRP RNA based on
crystallographic and biochemical data.

Halic et al. (2004) presented the structure of a targeting complex
consisting of mammalian SRP bound to an active 80S ribosome carrying a
signal sequence. This structure, determined to 12-angstrom resolution by
cryoelectron microscopy, enabled Halic et al. (2004) to generate a
molecular model of SRP in its functional conformation. The model showed
how the S domain of SRP contacts the large ribosomal subunit at the
nascent chain exit site to bind the signal sequence, and that the Alu
domain reaches into the elongation factor-binding site of the ribosome,
explaining its elongation arrest activity.

MAPPING

The SRP19 gene maps to chromosome 5q21-q22, between the DP1 (125265) and
APC (611731) genes (Groden et al., 1991).

608288	TITLE *608288 INSULIN-LIKE GROWTH FACTOR 2 mRNA-BINDING PROTEIN 1; IGF2BP1
;;IGF2 mRNA-BINDING PROTEIN 1; IMP1;;
CODING REGION DETERMINANT-BINDING PROTEIN, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; CRDBP;;
ZIPCODE-BINDING PROTEIN 1; ZBP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Nielsen et al. (1999) purified several IMP proteins from the
rhabdomyosarcoma (268210) cell line RD that bound to the leader 3 mRNA
in the 5-prime untranslated region of IGF2 (147470). Using degenerate
primers designed from tryptic fragments of IMP1 for RT-PCR of total RD
mRNA, followed by screening an EST database, they cloned IMP1. The
deduced 577-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 63 kD.
IMP1 contains 6 characteristic RNA-binding modules, including 2
N-terminal RRM domains and 4 central and C-terminal KH domains. It
shares 59% amino acid identity with IMP2 (IGF2BP2; 608289) and IMP3
(IGF2BP3; 608259), 95% identity with chicken zipcode-binding protein,
and 99% identity with mouse Crdbp. Immunocytochemical analysis of
cultured cells showed a dynamic subcellular localization for IMP1 that
was dependent upon the cell type, the degree of cell differentiation,
and exposure of the cells to serum factors that differ between newborn
and fetal calf serum. Northern blot analysis detected no expression of
Imp1, Imp2, or Imp3 in adult mouse tissues. However, analysis of mouse
embryos showed that expression of all 3 Imp transcripts peaked at
embryonic day 12.5 and declined toward birth. RNA dot blot analysis
detected moderate IMP1 expression in placenta and in all human fetal
tissues of mixed first-trimester age examined. Immunohistochemical
staining of developing human skeletal muscle cells showed IMP1 beneath
the plasma membrane along the circumference of myoblasts and myotubes.
IMP1 was also detected in trophoblasts of human term placenta.
Immunostaining of frozen mouse embryos detected expression of Imp1 at
the basal plasma cell membrane of developing epidermis, in epithelia of
the lung and intestines, and in skeletal muscle throughout development.

GENE FUNCTION

By mobility shift analysis, Nielsen et al. (1999) determined that IGF2
leader 3 mRNA contains at least 6 binding sites for IMP1; no binding
sites were found on IGF2 leader 4 mRNA. IMP1 competed with PTB (600693)
for IGF2 leader 3 mRNA binding in a Mg(2+)-dependent manner, and binding
was mutually exclusive. PTB was the predominant species at low Mg(2+)
concentrations, while IMP1 was predominant at higher Mg(2+)
concentrations. IMP1 inhibited translation from a leader 3 reporter mRNA
in vivo.

By FISH, Doyle et al. (2000) determined that the CRDBP gene was
magnified in 14 of 40 breast cancer samples, and the amplification was
found only in the tumor cells in each sample. In 7 of these 14 cases,
the HER2 gene (164870) was coamplified.

By RT-PCR, Ioannidis et al. (2003) detected expression of CRDBP in 69 of
118 (58.5%) primary breast tumors, but not in any normal breast tissue
examined. There was no significant association between CRDBP expression
and patient age, histologic tumor type, tumor size, nodal status, or
invasion. However, there was a borderline association between CRDBP
expression and advanced tumor grade (grade I/II vs grade III, p of
0.054), and a highly significant inverse association between CRDBP
expression and estrogen receptor (see 133430) expression (p of 0.005).
Copy number gains in the region encompassing the CRDBP gene were found
in 11 of 60 (18.3%) tumor samples, but 3 of these samples were negative
for CRDBP expression.

Localization of beta-actin (102630) mRNA to sites of active actin
polymerization modulates cell migration during embryogenesis,
differentiation, and possibly carcinogenesis. This localization requires
the oncofetal protein ZBP1, which binds to a conserved 54-nucleotide
element in the 3-prime untranslated region of the beta-actin mRNA known
as the 'zipcode.' ZBP1 promotes translocation of the beta-actin
transcript to actin-rich protrusions in primary fibroblasts and neurons.
Huttelmaier et al. (2005) showed that chicken ZBP1 modulates the
translation of beta-actin mRNA. ZBP1 associates with the beta-actin
transcript in the nucleus and prevents premature translation in the
cytoplasm by blocking translation initiation. Translation occurs only
when the ZBP1-RNA complex reaches its destination at the periphery of
the cell. At the endpoint of mRNA transport, the protein kinase Src
(190090) promotes translation by phosphorylating a key tyrosine residue
in ZBP1 that is required for binding to RNA. These sequential events
provide both temporal and spatial control over beta-actin mRNA
translation, which is important for cell migration and neurite
outgrowth.

Noubissi et al. (2006) demonstrated that beta-catenin (see 116806)
stabilizes the mRNA encoding the F-box protein beta-TrCP1 (BTRCP1;
603482), and identified the RNA-binding protein CRDBP as a target of
beta catenin/Tcf transcription factor. CRDBP binds to the coding region
of BTRCP1 mRNA. Overexpression of CRDBP stabilized BTRCP1 mRNA and
elevated BTRCP1 levels both in cells and in vivo, resulting in the
activation of the Skp1-Cullin1-F-box protein (SCF)-BTRCP1 E3 ubiquitin
ligase and in accelerated turnover of its substrates including I-kappa-B
(see 164008) and beta-catenin. CRDBP is essential for the induction of
both BTRCP1 and c-Myc (190080) by beta-catenin signaling in colorectal
cancer cells. Noubissi et al. (2006) concluded that high levels of CRDBP
that are found in primary human colorectal tumors exhibiting active
beta-catenin/Tcf signaling implicates CRDBP induction in the
upregulation of BTRCP1, in the activation of dimeric transcription
factor NF-kappa-B (see 164011), and in the suppression of apoptosis in
these cancers.

GENE STRUCTURE

Doyle et al. (2000) determined that the mouse Crdbp gene contains 15
exons and spans about 40 kb.

MAPPING

By FISH, Doyle et al. (2000) mapped the CRDBP (IGF2BP1) gene to
chromosome 17q21.3. It lies distal to the HER2 and RARA (180240) genes
and proximal to the MPO gene (606989). Doyle et al. (2000) mapped the
mouse Crdbp gene to chromosome 11.

;;NEUROPATHY TARGET ESTERASE; NTE;;
NEUROTOXIC ESTERASE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Covalent modification of neuropathy target esterase (NTE) by certain
organophosphorus esters (OPs) leads, after a delay of several days, to a
degeneration of long axons in the spinal cord and peripheral nerves.
Lush et al. (1998) determined a partial protein sequence of pig NTE.
They searched an EST database and identified a human cDNA that encodes a
polypeptide showing homology to 1 of the pig NTE peptides. Using this
cDNA as a probe, the authors screened a human fetal brain cDNA library
and isolated a cDNA containing the entire NTE coding sequence. The
deduced 1,327-amino acid protein contains 4 predicted transmembrane
domains and multiple potential sites for N- and O-linked glycosylation.
SDS-PAGE and biochemical analyses showed that human NTE is a
glycoprotein with an apparent molecular mass of 155 kD. NTE shares 41%
amino acid sequence identity with the Drosophila 'Swiss Cheese' (Sws)
protein, which is involved in the regulation of interactions between
neurons and glia in the developing fly brain.

MAPPING

In the positional cloning of the mucolipidosis IV gene (MCOLN1; 605248),
which maps to 19p13.3-p13.2, Bargal et al. (2000) found that the NTE
gene is located in this region. They analyzed all 33 coding exons of
this gene in 6 mucolipidosis IV patients and identified no mutations.

By FISH, Winrow et al. (2003) demonstrated that the Nte locus maps to
mouse chromosome 8A1.1 and the human NTE gene maps to 19p13.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The pathogenesis of organophosphorous (OP) compound-induced delayed
neuropathy (OPIDN) involves neuropathy target esterase (NTE), a neuronal
membrane protein, either through direct OP-induced inhibition of NTE or
through generation of OP-NTE neurotoxic complexes ('aged NTE'). Rainier
et al. (2008) described 2 families, one consanguineous, in which
affected subjects exhibited progressive spastic paraplegia and distal
muscle wasting (SPG39; 612020). Affected subjects resembled those with
OPIDN and those with Troyer syndrome (275900) due to SPG20 (607111) gene
mutation. The latter possibility was excluded by genetic linkage and
sequence analysis of the SPG20 gene. Genomewide analysis suggested
linkage to a 22-cM homozygous locus on 19p13 to which NTE had been
mapped. NTE was a candidate because of its role in OPIDN and the
similarity of the patients to those with OPIDN. Affected subjects in the
consanguineous kindred were homozygous for a disease-specific NTE
mutation, 3034A-G, that disrupted an interspecies-conserved residue in
NTE's catalytic domain (M1012V; 603197.0001). Affected subjects in the
nonconsanguineous family were compound heterozygotes: 1 allele carried a
2669G-A mutation that disrupted an interspecies-conserved residue in
NTE's catalytic domain (R890H; 603197.0002), and the other allele had an
insertion that caused frameshift and protein truncation (603197.0003).
Disease-specific, nonconserved NTE mutations in unrelated patients with
motor neuron disease (MND) indicated the importance of NTE in
maintaining axonal integrity, raised the possibility that NTE pathway
disturbances contribute to other MNDs including amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS; see 105400), and supported the role of NTE abnormalities
in axonopathy produced by neuropathic OP compounds.

ANIMAL MODEL

NTE is involved in neuronal development and is the target for
neurodegeneration induced by selected organophosphorus pesticides and
chemical warfare agents. Winrow et al. (2003) generated mice with
disruption in Nte. Nte -/- mice died after embryonic day 8, and
heterozygous Nte +/- mice had lower activity of Nte in the brain and
higher mortality when exposed to an Nte-inhibiting compound (EOPF) than
did wildtype mice. Nte +/- and wildtype mice treated with 1 mg per kg of
body weight of EOPF had elevated motor activity, showing that even minor
reduction of Nte activity leads to hyperactivity. Studies showed that
genetic or chemical reduction of Nte activity results in a neurologic
phenotype of hyperactivity in mammals and indicated that EOPF toxicity
occurs directly through inhibition of Nte without the requirement for
Nte gain of function or aging.

O'Callaghan (2003) interpreted the significance of the studies of Winrow
et al. (2003) in relation to the toxicity of organophosphates, which
have long been used as pesticides and which are a concern because of
their potential use as chemical warfare agents. As a class of compounds,
organophosphate esters inhibit serine-containing esterases owing to
phosphorylation of serine residues at the active site of these enzymes,
the most notable of which is acetylcholinesterase (100740). Most
features of the acute toxicity of these compounds relate to their
inhibition of this enzyme. A less well known feature of some
organophosphates is their propensity to cause a delayed neuropathy that
has been termed organophosphate-induced delayed neurotoxicity (OPIDN).
This is a progressive neurologic condition characterized by weakness,
ataxia, and subsequent paralysis of the limbs. The major neuropathologic
hallmarks of OPIDN are degeneration of the long exons of the spinal cord
and peripheral neurons. The proposed target for initiation of OPIDN has
been NTE. The mechanistic basis for initiation of OPIDN through NTE was
thought to involve the generation of an 'aged' form of the enzyme. The
work of Winrow et al. (2003) provided evidence against the aging concept
without ruling out involvement of NTE itself. Mice deficient in the
enzyme should be less susceptible to toxicity, but the opposite turned
out to be the case.

Moser et al. (2004) observed lethality in Nte-null mouse embryos after
gastrulation at embryonic day 9 postcoitum. As early as embryonic day
7.5, mutant embryos showed growth retardation which did not reflect
impaired cell proliferation but resulted from failed placental
development; as a consequence, massive apoptosis within the developing
embryo preceded its resorption. Histologic analysis indicated that NTE
is essential for the formation of the labyrinth layer and the survival
and differentiation of secondary giant cells. Impaired vasculogenesis in
the yolk sacs and embryos of null mutant conceptuses suggested that NTE
is also required for normal blood vessel development.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 39, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
PNPLA6, MET1012VAL

In a consanguineous family of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry, Rainier et al.
(2008) demonstrated an association between motor neuron disease (SPG39;
612020) and homozygosity for a missense mutation in the NTE gene:
3034A-G, met1012 to val (M1012V).

In a nonconsanguineous family, Rainier et al. (2008) found that motor
neuron disease (SPG39; 612020) was associated with compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the NTE gene. On 1 allele the 2
affected individuals carried a G-to-A transition at cDNA position 2669
that resulted in substitution of histidine for arginine at codon 890
(R890H); the other allele carried a 4-bp insertion (603197.0003). The
affected individuals were brother and sister, and inherited the missense
mutation from the father and the insertion from the mother.

.0003
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 39, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE

The 2 affected individuals with motor neuron disease (SPG39; 612020) in
the nonconsanguineous family described by Rainier et al. (2008) carried
a 4-bp insertion on the maternal allele, 2946_2947insCAGC, that caused
frameshift and protein truncation (S982fs1019). The paternal allele
carried a missense mutation (603197.0002).

603819	TITLE *603819 STEROID RECEPTOR RNA ACTIVATOR 1; SRA1
;;SRA
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screening system, Lanz et al. (1999) isolated a
transcriptional coactivator of steroid nuclear receptors, termed steroid
receptor RNA activator (SRA). Northern blot analysis revealed that the
SRA gene was expressed in all human tissues tested as major transcripts
of approximately 0.7 to 0.85 kb and minor transcripts of approximately
1.3 to 1.5 kb; SRA was expressed at high levels in liver and skeletal
muscle and at a low level in brain.

GENE FUNCTION

Lanz et al. (1999) found that SRA was selective for steroid hormone
receptors and mediated transactivation via their N-terminal activation
function. The authors provided functional and mechanistic evidence that
SRA acts as an RNA transcript; transfected SRA, unlike other steroid
receptor coregulators, functioned in the presence of cycloheximide, and
SRA mutants containing multiple translational stop signals retained
their ability to activate steroid receptor-dependent gene expression.
Biochemical fractionation showed that SRA exists in distinct
ribonucleoprotein complexes, one of which contains steroid receptor
coactivator-1 (602691). Lanz et al. (1999) suggested that SRA may act to
confer functional specificity upon multiprotein complexes recruited by
liganded receptors during transcriptional activation.

By immunoprecipitation analysis, Caretti et al. (2006) found that p68
(DDX5; 180630), p72 (DDX17; 608469), and the noncoding RNA SRA
associated with MYOD (MYOD1; 159970) in MYOD-transfected HeLa cells. In
vitro and in vivo experiments identified p68, p72, and SRA as
coactivators of MYOD, and their knockdown in C2C12 mouse myoblast cells
prevented proper muscle gene expression and cell differentiation.

MAPPING

By sequence comparisons, Lanz et al. (1999) identified partial SRA
sequences isolated as HepG2 3-prime untranslated region (GenBank GENBANK
D16861), EST clones, and chromosome 5 BAC clone 319C17 (GenBank GENBANK
AC005214), providing a preliminary mapping of the SRA gene to chromosome
5.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By PCR of human placenta, liver, and testis cDNA libraries, followed by
database analysis, Soucy and Luu-The (2002) isolated CYB5B. The deduced
153-amino acid protein shares 45.8% homology with CYB5A (613218), and
RT-PCR analysis showed CYB5B expression in human liver, testis, and
adrenal tissues. CYB5B had 17,20-lyase activity as measured by the
conversion of pregnenolone to dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) when
expressed in HEK293 cells.

MAPPING

Hartz (2010) mapped the CYB5B gene to chromosome 16q22.1 based on an
alignment of the CYB5B sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB009282) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

602334	TITLE *602334 EPITHELIAL MEMBRANE PROTEIN 2; EMP2
DESCRIPTION By homology screening of databases, Ben-Porath and Benvenisty (1996) and
Taylor and Suter (1996) independently identified a cDNA encoding
epithelial membrane protein-2 (EMP2). The predicted 167-amino acid EMP2
protein contains 4 membrane-spanning domains and 3 N-linked
glycosylation motifs in the first extracellular loop. Taylor and Suter
(1996) showed that the EMP2 cDNA generates an 18-kD protein in vitro.
The EMP2 protein shares 43% amino acid identity with peripheral myelin
protein-22 (PMP22; 601097); they are particularly homologous in their
transmembrane domains. Due to the high amino acid sequence homology
among PMP22, EMP1 (602334), EMP2, and EMP3 (602335), Ben-Porath and
Benvenisty (1996) stated that these proteins belong to a novel family.
Based on the suggested functions of PMP22, Ben-Porath and Benvenisty
(1996) and Taylor and Suter (1996) proposed that EMP2 is involved in
cell proliferation and cell-cell interactions. Using Northern blot
analysis, Taylor and Suter (1996) found prominent EMP2 expression in
adult ovary, heart, lung, and intestine and lower expression in most
other tissues, including the liver. In the fetus, they found high EMP2
mRNA levels in the lung and kidney and lower levels in the liver and
brain.

By somatic cell hybridization, radiation hybrid analysis, and YAC
library screening, Liehr et al. (1999) mapped the EMP2 gene to
chromosome 16p13.2. Ben Porath et al. (1998) mapped the homologous gene
in the mouse to chromosome 16.

610369	TITLE *610369 HEAT-SHOCK 70-KD PROTEIN 14; HSPA14
;;HSP70-LIKE 1; HSP70L1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing a human dendritic cell cDNA library, Wan et al. (2004)
obtained a full-length cDNA encoding HSPA14, which they called HSP70L1.
The deduced 509-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of
54.8 kD. It has an N-terminal ATPase domain and 2 potential
N-glycosylation sites. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.1-kb
transcript in all tissues examined, with highest levels in testis,
spleen, and thymus. RT-PCR detected HSP70L1 expression in various cell
lines, with highest levels in immune cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Wan et al. (2004) transfected HeLa cells with HSP70L1 and found that
HSP70L1 expression was upregulated by heat stress, TNF-alpha (191160),
and phorbol esters. HSP70L1 interacted with human dendritic cells (DCs),
resulting in DC maturation and activation. Although HSP70L1 shared
common cell surface receptors with HSP70 (HSPA1A; 140550), including
TLR2 (603028) and TLR4 (603030), there were functional differences
between the 2 proteins. HSP70L1 and HSP70 stimulated DC secretion of the
proinflammatory cytokines IL1B (147720) and TNF-alpha at comparable
levels, but HSP70L1 was a more potent stimulator of IL12p70 (see
161560). HSP70L1 induced secretion of the chemokines MIP1A (CCL3;
182283), MIP1B (CCL4; 182284), and RANTES (CCL5; 187011) and expression
of the chemokine receptors CCR7 (600242) and CXCR4 (162643) more
potently than HSP70. In addition, HSP70L1, but not HSP70, could induce
IP10 (CXCL10; 147310) secretion.

Otto et al. (2005) found that MPP11 and HSP70L1 formed a complex in HeLa
cells, rat liver, and rabbit reticulate lysate. The 2 proteins coeluted
on cation and anion exchange columns, and sucrose density gradients
showed that they comigrated with polysomes and ribosomes. The 200-kD
dimeric ribosome-associated complex (RAC) formed by MPP11 and HSP70L1
was sensitive to salt treatment and could rescue growth defects in yeast
strains lacking functional RAC.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Wan et al. (2004) mapped the HSPA14 gene
to chromosome 10p12.33.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The S. cerevisiae gene RAD51, which encodes a protein related to the
ATP-binding E. coli RecA protein, is critical for DNA repair and meiotic
recombination. Homologs of this gene have been identified in several
species, including mouse and human. Pittman et al. (1998) reported the
identification of a novel member of the RAD51 gene family in both mouse
and human. The mouse cDNA, Rad51d, isolated by screening EST databases
with yeast RAD55 and human RAD51B amino acid sequences, encodes a
predicted 329-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 35,260 Da.
Northern blot analysis revealed the presence of multiple transcripts of
the Rad51d gene in all tissues examined. Southern analysis of genomic
DNA from 7 mammalian species demonstrated that the RAD51D gene is
conserved. Pittman et al. (1998) used the mouse nucleotide sequence to
screen a human EST database and identified 2 RAD51D cDNA clones from
human T-lymphocyte and placenta libraries; both cDNAs appeared to be
variants of the mouse gene. The shorter cDNA represented an
alternatively spliced product and excluded sequences corresponding to 2
exons in the mouse gene, one of which encodes the first ATP-binding
motif. The longer cDNA skipped a single exon present in the mouse gene,
resulting in a frameshift and a predicted truncated protein. The authors
stated that if the frameshift is ignored, the full-length putative
289-amino acid protein shares 71% sequence identity with the predicted
mouse protein, and the mouse and human RAD51D genes have 2 conserved
ATP-binding domains similar to other RecA-related genes.

Cartwright et al. (1998) also isolated human and mouse RAD51L3, or
R51H3, cDNAs. They found that the sequence of the predicted 328-amino
acid human protein is 82% identical to that of mouse RAD51L3. Northern
blot analysis revealed that human RAD51L3 is expressed as a 1.7-kb mRNA
in all tissues, with the highest levels in testis.

Kawabata and Saeki (1999) cloned RAD51L3, which they called TRAD, from a
placenta cDNA library based on sequence similarity with the mouse gene.
They obtained the full-length cDNA by PCR of adult and fetal brain cDNA
libraries. The deduced 328-amino acid protein contains both A and B
nucleotide-binding motifs and shares 83% sequence identity with the
mouse protein. Kawabata and Saeki (1999) also identified several
truncated variants, 1 of which lacks the nucleotide-binding sites, that
result from exon skipping. Northern blot analysis revealed a 7.0-bp
transcript in colon and prostate, a 4.8-kb transcript in spleen, colon,
prostate, testis, and ovary, and 1.4-, 1.8-, and 2.5-kb transcripts in
testis, spleen, thymus, prostate, ovary, small intestine, and colon. All
transcripts were expressed at low levels in leukocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

Braybrooke et al. (2000) confirmed the binding and hydrolysis of ATP by
recombinant RAD51L3 in the presence of Mg(2+). Single-stranded DNA was a
more efficient cofactor than double-stranded DNA. They determined that
the binding of DNA to RAD51L3 was sequence- and Mg(2+)-independent.
Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay, Braybrooke et al. (2000) identified a
direct interaction between XRCC2 (600375) and RAD51L3, and they
confirmed the interaction by pull-down assays between recombinant XRCC2
and endogenous RAD51L3 in HeLa cell extracts. Size-exclusion
chromatography followed by Western blot analysis suggested that the 2
proteins exist as a heterodimer of about 70 kD.

Masson et al. (2001) found that antibody directed against RAD51L3
immunoprecipitated a complex from HeLa cell lysates that included XRCC2,
RAD51B (RAD51L1; 602948), and RAD51C (602774), along with endogenous
RAD51L3. Interactions between these proteins were confirmed in pull-down
assays using recombinant proteins expressed in sf9 insect cells. Gel
filtration of the complexes indicated an apparent molecular mass of
about 180 kD, suggesting a 1:1:1:1 stoichiometry of the 4 subunits.
Binding assays, confirmed by electron microscopy, indicated that the
purified complex bound single-stranded or nicked DNA. This binding was
dependent on Mg(2+) but independent of ATP. The DNA-stimulated ATPase
activity of the complex was extremely low. Masson et al. (2001) also
identified a second, heterodimeric protein complex between RAD51C and
XRCC3 (600675). Using coprecipitation and multiple pull-down assays, Liu
et al. (2002) confirmed interaction between the same RAD51 paralogs in
the same 2 distinct protein complexes.

In a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human brain cDNA library using XRCC2 as
bait, Kurumizaka et al. (2002) found that RAD51L3 interacts directly
with XRCC2. Using a D-loop formation assay, they found that RAD51L3 and
XRCC2, coexpressed and purified from bacterial cultures, catalyze
homologous pairing between a single-stranded oligonucleotide and a
superhelical double-stranded DNA. Significant single- and
double-stranded DNA were bound by the complex in the absence of ATP, but
homologous pairing was dependent on ATP and Mg(2+). By electron
microscopy, they found that RAD51L3 and XRCC2 form a multimeric ring
structure in the absence of DNA, and they form filamentous structures in
the presence of single-stranded DNA.

Tarsounas et al. (2004) reported that RAD51D is involved in telomere
maintenance. Using immunofluorescence labeling, electron microscopy, and
chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, they localized RAD51D to the
telomeres of both meiotic and somatic cells. Telomerase (see
187270)-positive Rad51d -/- Trp53 (191170) -/- primary mouse embryonic
fibroblasts (MEFs) exhibited telomeric DNA repeat shortening compared
with Trp53 -/- or wildtype MEFs. Moreover, elevated levels of
chromosomal aberrations were detected, including telomeric end-to-end
fusions, a signature of telomere dysfunction. Inhibition of RAD51D
synthesis in telomerase-negative immortalized human cells by small
interfering RNA also resulted in telomere erosion and chromosome fusion.
Tarsounas et al. (2004) concluded that RAD51D plays a dual cellular role
in both the repair of DNA double-strand breaks and telomere protection
against attrition and fusion.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid mapping, Pittman et al. (1998) assigned the RAD51D
gene to chromosome 17q11, in a region showing homology of synteny to
mouse chromosome 11. By interspecific backcross mapping, Pittman et al.
(1998) mapped the mouse Rad51d gene to chromosome 11.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Loveday et al. (2011) identified nonsense, frameshift, and missense
mutations in the RAD51D gene in 8 unrelated probands from 911
breast-ovarian cancer families. None of the mutations was found among
1,060 controls, although one different frameshift mutation was found.

604511	TITLE *604511 CHROMOBOX HOMOLOG 1; CBX1
;;CBX;;
HP1, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, BETA;;
HP1-BETA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Heterochromatin protein-1 (HP1) is localized at heterochromatin sites,
where it mediates gene silencing.

CLONING

Some autoimmune sera recognize antigens located near the centromere
(CENPA, 117139; CENPB, 117140; CENPC1, 117141) as well as
heterochromatin protein-1 (HP1). Using human autoimmune serum to screen
a HepG2 library, Furuta et al. (1997) isolated a cDNA encoding CBX1, a
human homolog of Drosophila HP1, which the authors called HP1-beta. CBX1
encodes a 185-amino acid protein that has 66% sequence identity and 80%
similarity to CBX5 (604478). CBX1 is 100% identical to mouse M31 and to
human HSM1, which was identified by Singh et al. (1991). CBX1 has a
conserved 37-amino acid region called the chromodomain, or chromobox, in
the N-terminal region. Immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that only
antibodies directed against the C terminus of CBX1 showed nucleoplasmic
and heterochromatin staining. N-terminal-specific antibodies were
nonreactive. The C-terminal domain antibodies were also reactive with
the centromeric region during metaphase and anaphase and with whole
chromosomes during telophase.

GENE FUNCTION

Lachner et al. (2001) showed that mammalian methyltransferases that
selectively methylate histone H3 (see 602810) on lysine-9 (Suv39h
HMTases; see SUV39H1, 300254) generate a binding site for HP1 proteins,
a family of heterochromatic adaptor molecules implicated in both gene
silencing and supranucleosomal chromatin structure. High-affinity in
vitro recognition of a methylated histone H3 peptide by HP1 requires a
functional chromodomain; thus, the HP1 chromodomain is a specific
interaction motif for the methyl epitope on lysine-9 of histone H3. In
vivo, heterochromatin association of HP1 proteins is lost in Suv39h
double-null primary mouse fibroblasts but is restored after
reintroduction of a catalytically active SUV39H1 HMTase. Lachner et al.
(2001) concluded that their data define a molecular mechanism through
which the SUV39H-HP1 methylation system can contribute to the
propagation of heterochromatic subdomains in native chromatin.

Bannister et al. (2001) demonstrated that HP1 can bind with high
affinity to histone H3 methylated at lysine-9 but not at lysine-4. They
identified the chromodomain of HP1 as its methyl-lysine-binding domain.
A point mutation in the chromodomain, which destroys the gene silencing
activity of HP1 in Drosophila, abolished methyl-lysine-binding activity.
Genetic and biochemical analysis in S. pombe showed that the methylase
activity of Clr4 (the SUV39H1 homolog) is necessary for the correct
localization of Swi6 (the HP1 equivalent) at centromeric heterochromatin
and for gene silencing. Bannister et al. (2001) concluded that these
results provide a stepwise model for the formation of a
transcriptionally silent heterochromatin: SUV39H1 places a methyl marker
on histone H3, which is then recognized by HP1 through its chromodomain.
This model may also explain the stable inheritance of the
heterochromatic state.

Eukaryotic genomes are organized into discrete structural and functional
chromatin domains. Noma et al. (2001) demonstrated that distinct
site-specific histone H3 methylation patterns define euchromatic and
heterochromatic chromosomal domains within an 47-kb region of the mating
type locus in fission yeast. H3 methylated at lysine-9, and its
interacting Swi6 protein, are strictly localized to a 20-kb silent
heterochromatic interval. In contrast, H3 methylated at lysine-4 is
specific to the surrounding euchromatic regions. Two inverted repeats
flanking the silent interval serve as boundary elements to mark the
borders between heterochromatin and euchromatin. Deletions of these
boundary elements leads to spreading of H3 lys9 methylation and Swi6
into neighboring sequences. Furthermore, the H3 lys6 methylation and
corresponding heterochromatin-associated complexes prevent H3 lys4
methylation in the silent domain.

Festenstein et al. (2003) used fluorescence recovery after
photobleaching to demonstrate that a GFP-HP1-beta fusion protein is
highly mobile within both the euchromatin and heterochromatin of ex vivo
resting murine T cells. Moreover, T cell activation greatly increased
this mobility, indicating that such a process may facilitate
(hetero)chromatin remodeling and permit access of epigenetic modifiers
and transcription factors to the many genes that are consequently
derepressed.

Cheutin et al. (2003) demonstrated that maintenance of stable
heterochromatin domains in living cells involves the transient binding
and dynamic exchange of HP1 from chromatin. HP1 exchange kinetics
correlated with the condensation level of chromatin and were dependent
on the histone methyltransferase Suv39h (300254). The chromodomain and
the chromoshadow domain of HP1 are both required for binding to native
chromatin in vivo, but they contribute differentially to binding in
euchromatin and heterochromatin. Cheutin et al. (2003) suggested that
their data argue against HP1 repression of transcription by formation of
static, higher order oligomeric networks but support a dynamic
competition model, and demonstrate that heterochromatin is accessible to
regulatory factors.

Fischle et al. (2005) demonstrated that HP1-alpha (604478), HP1-beta,
and HP1-gamma (604477) are released from chromatin during the M phase of
the cell cycle even though trimethylation levels of histone H3 lys9
remain unchanged. However, the additional transient modification of
histone H3 by phosphorylation of ser10 next to the more stable
methyl-lys9 mark is sufficient to eject HP1 proteins from their binding
sites. Inhibition or depletion of the mitotic kinase Aurora B (604970),
which phosphorylates histone H3 on ser10, causes retention of HP1
proteins on mitotic chromosomes, suggesting that H3 ser10
phosphorylation is necessary for the dissociation of HP1 from chromatin
in M phase. Fischle et al. (2005) concluded that their findings
establish a regulatory mechanism of protein-protein interactions,
through a combinatorial readout of 2 adjacent posttranslational
modifications: a stable methylation and a dynamic phosphorylation mark.

Smallwood et al. (2007) demonstrated that DNMT1 (126375) could interact
with HP1-alpha, HP1-beta, and HP1-gamma in a human colon carcinoma cell
line, resulting in stimulation of DNMT1 methyltransferase activity. The
HP1 proteins were sufficient to target DNMT1 activity in vivo, and
HP1-dependent repression required DNMT1. Smallwood et al. (2007)
demonstrated that HP1-alpha and HP1-beta were recruited to the survivin
(BIRC5; 603352) promoter in a DNMT1-dependent manner. They concluded
that direct interactions between HP1 proteins and DNMT1 mediate
silencing of euchromatic genes.

Ayoub et al. (2008) identified a dynamic change in chromatin that
promotes H2AX (601772) phosphorylation in mammalian cells. DNA breaks
swiftly mobilized HP1-beta, a chromatin factor bound to histone H3
methylated on lysine-9 (H3K9me; see 601128). Local changes in histone
tail modifications were not apparent. Instead, phosphorylation of
HP1-beta on amino acid thr51 accompanied mobilization, releasing
HP1-beta from chromatin by disrupting hydrogen bonds that fold its
chromodomain around H3K9me. Inhibition of casein kinase-2 (CK2; see
115442), an enzyme implicated in DNA damage sensing and repair,
suppressed thr51 phosphorylation and HP1-beta mobilization in living
cells. CK2 inhibition, or a constitutively chromatin-bound HP1-beta
mutant, diminished H2AX phosphorylation. Ayoub et al. (2008) concluded
that their findings revealed a signaling cascade that helps to initiate
the DNA damage response, altering chromatin by modifying a histone code
mediator protein, HP1, but not the code itself.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Nielsen et al. (2002) showed that HP1 uses an induced-fit mechanism to
recognize the methylation of lys9, as revealed by the structure of its
chromodomain bound to a histone H3 peptide dimethylated at N-zeta of
lys9. The binding pocket for the N-methyl groups is provided by 3
aromatic side chains, tyr21, trp42, and phe45, which reside in 2 regions
that become ordered on binding of the peptide. The side chain of lys9 is
almost fully extended and surrounded by residues that are conserved in
many other chromodomains. The QTAR peptide sequence preceding lys9
performs most of the additional interactions with the chromodomain, with
HP1 residues val23, leu40, trp42, leu58, and cys60 appearing to be a
major determinant of specificity by binding the key buried ala7. Nielsen
et al. (2002) concluded that their findings predict which other
chromodomains will bind methylated proteins and suggest a motif that
they might recognize.

606826	TITLE *606826 PLEXIN DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; PLXDC1
;;TUMOR ENDOTHELIAL MARKER 7; TEM7
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE), St Croix et al. (2000)
identified partial cDNAs corresponding to several tumor endothelial
markers (TEMs) that displayed elevated expression during tumor
angiogenesis. Among the genes they identified was PLXDC1, which they
called TEM7. Using database searches and 5-prime RACE, Carson-Walter et
al. (2001) derived sequences covering the entire TEM7 coding region,
which encodes a 500-amino acid type I transmembrane protein containing a
plexin-like domain. An alternate transcript of the TEM7 gene had been
designated TEM3 by St Croix et al. (2000). TEM3 and TEM7 differ in the
use of alternative polyadenylation sites but result in the same
predicted protein. The mouse ortholog of TEM7 shares 81% amino acid
identity with the human protein.

In situ hybridization analysis of human colorectal cancer by
Carson-Walter et al. (2001) demonstrated that TEM7 was expressed clearly
in the endothelial cells of the tumor stroma but not in the endothelial
cells of normal colonic tissue. Using in situ hybridization to assay
expression in various normal adult mouse tissues, they observed that
Tem7 was largely undetectable in mouse tissues or tumors, but was
abundantly expressed in mouse brain. Carson-Walter et al. (2001)
localized Tem7 expression to Purkinje cells of the cerebellum and some
neuronal cells.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PLXDC1
gene to chromosome 17 (TMAP stSG4079).

;;GREMLIN;;
CYSTINE KNOT SUPERFAMILY 1, BMP ANTAGONIST 1; CKTSF1B1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a Xenopus expression-cloning screen, Hsu et al. (1998) isolated
GREM1, an antagonist of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP; see 112264)
signaling that is expressed in the neural crest. Gremlin-1 belongs to a
novel gene family that includes the head-inducing factor cerberus (CER1;
603777) and the tumor suppressor DAN (600613). Hsu et al. (1998) showed
that all family members are secreted proteins and that they act as BMP
antagonists in embryonic explants. They also provided support for the
model that gremlin, cerberus, and DAN block BMP signaling by binding
BMPs, preventing them from interacting with their receptors. They
proposed that gremlin, cerberus, and DAN control diverse processes in
growth and development by selectively antagonizing the activities of
different subsets of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta ligands.
By homology searches, Hsu et al. (1998) cloned the human homolog of
Xenopus gremlin. The human gremlin cDNA encodes a predicted 184-amino
acid protein.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid analyses, Topol et al.
(2000) mapped the GREM1 gene to human chromosome 15q13-q15.

GENE FUNCTION

Zuniga et al. (1999) reported that the secreted BMP antagonist gremlin
relays the Sonic hedgehog (SHH; 600725) signal from the polarizing
region to the apical ectodermal ridge. Mesenchymal gremlin expression is
lost in limb buds of mouse embryos homozygous for the 'limb deformity'
(ld) mutation, which disrupts establishment of the Shh/Fgf4 (164980)
feedback loop. Grafting gremlin-expressing cells into ld mutant limb
buds rescued Fgf4 expression and restored the Shh/Fgf4 feedback loop.
Analysis of Shh-null mutant embryos revealed that Shh signaling is
required for maintenance of gremlin and formin (FMN1; 136535), the gene
disrupted by the ld mutations. In contrast, formin, gremlin, and Fgf4
activation were independent of Shh signaling. Zuniga et al. (1999)
concluded that the study uncovered the cascade by which the SHH signal
is relayed from the posterior mesenchyme to the apical ectodermal ridge
and established that formin-dependent activation of the BMP antagonist
gremlin is sufficient to induce Fgf4 and establish the SHH/Fgf4 feedback
loop.

Vertebrate limb outgrowth is driven by a positive feedback loop
involving SHH, gremlin, and FGF4. By overexpressing individual
components of the loop at a time after these genes are normally
downregulated in chicken embryos, Scherz et al. (2004) found that Shh no
longer maintains gremlin in the posterior limb. Shh-expressing cells and
their descendants cannot express gremlin. The proliferation of these
descendants forms a barrier separating the Shh signal from
gremlin-expressing cells, which breaks down the Shh-Fgf4 loop and
thereby affects limb size and provides a mechanism explaining regulative
properties of the limb bud.

Developmentally regulated programmed cell death sculpts the limbs and
other embryonic organs in vertebrates. In chickens and mice, Bmps
trigger apoptosis of the interdigital mesenchyme, leading to freed
digits, whereas in ducks, Bmp antagonists inhibit the apoptotic program,
resulting in webbed feet. Weatherbee et al. (2006) found the bat C.
perspicillata utilizes a unique combination of high Fgf8 (600483) and
gremlin expression to maintain interdigit tissue in the forelimb,
resulting in simultaneously elevated Fgf signaling and inhibited Bmp
signaling.

Wordinger et al. (2007) studied the effects of altered BMP signaling on
intraocular pressure (IOP) in primary open angle glaucoma (POAG; see
137760). They found that the human trabecular meshwork (TM) synthesized
and secreted BMP4 (112262) as well as expressed the BMP receptor
subtypes BMPR1 (see 601299) and BMPR2 (600799). TM cells responded to
exogenous BMP4 by phosphorylating SMAD signaling proteins (see 601595).
Cultured human TM cells treated with TGFB2 (190220) significantly
increased fibronectin (FN; 135600) levels, and BMP4 blocked this FN
induction. There was significant elevation of mRNA and protein levels of
the BMP antagonist gremlin in glaucomatous TM cells. In addition,
gremlin was present in human aqueous humor. Gremlin blocked the negative
effect of BMP4 on TGFB2 induction of FN. Addition of recombinant gremlin
to the medium of ex vivo perfusion-cultured human eye anterior segments
caused the glaucoma phenotype of elevated IOP. Wordinger et al. (2007)
concluded that these results were consistent with the hypothesis that,
in POAG, elevated expression of gremlin by TM cells inhibited BMP4
antagonism of TGFB2 and led to increased extracellular matrix deposition
and elevated IOP.

Limb development is regulated by epithelial-mesenchymal feedback loops
between SHH and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling involving the
bone morphogenetic protein antagonist gremlin-1. By combining mouse
molecular genetics with mathematical modeling, Benazet et al. (2009)
showed that BMP4 first initiates and SHH then propagates
epithelial-mesenchymal feedback signaling through differential
transcriptional regulation of Grem1 to control digit specification. This
switch occurs by linking a fast BMP4/GREM1 module to the slower
SHH/GREM1/FGF epithelial-mesenchymal feedback loop. This self-regulatory
signaling network results in robust regulation of distal limb
development that is able to compensate for variations by
interconnectivity among the 3 signaling pathways.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 8 Ashkenazi Jewish families segregating autosomal
dominant hereditary mixed polyposis syndrome mapping to chromosome
15q13.3 (HMPS1; 601228), Jaeger et al. (2012) identified heterozygosity
for an approximately 40-kb duplication centered on chr. 15:30.77 Mb that
was not found in 188 unselected Ashkenazi controls or in 935 controls
from the Colorectal Tumour Gene Identification (CORGI) study. PCR
amplification across the duplication breakpoints mapped it to chr.
15:30,752,231-30,792,051 (NCBI36), and the change was found to be a
simple tandem tail-head duplication with insertion of a 30-bp sequence
of unknown origin that had no homology to known sequences between the
duplicons. The duplication extended from intron 2 of the SCG5 gene to a
site just upstream of the GREM1 CpG island; however, only the normal
SCG5 mRNA species was found, and there were no significant differences
in SCG5 expression compared to controls. In contrast, markedly increased
GREM1 transcript levels were detected in the normal epithelium of HMPS
patients compared to controls, and allele-specific expression analysis
showed significantly increased expression of the duplicated allele in
HMPS crypts. In normal colorectal crypts of controls and unaffected
relatives, GREM1 expression was restricted to intestinal subepithelial
myofibroblasts (ISEMFs) at the crypt base, whereas in normal colorectal
crypts of HMPS patients, GREM1 was expressed not only in basal ISEMFs
but also at very high levels in epithelial cells, predominantly
colonocytes, with expression extending most of the way up the sides of
the crypts. Increased GREM1 expression was also seen in HMPS polyps, but
to a lesser extent than in normal epithelium. Jaeger et al. (2012)
demonstrated that a 3-kb region within the duplication (chr.
15:30,779,000-30,782,000, NCBI36) enhanced GREM1 expression 4-fold in
the SW948 CRC cell line and that the region interacts directly with the
GREM1 promoter. Increased GREM1 expression was predicted to cause
reduced BMP (see 112264) pathway activity, a mechanism that also
underlies tumorigenesis in juvenile polyposis of the large bowel
(174900).

ANIMAL MODEL

During limb outgrowth, signaling by BMPs must be moderated to maintain
the signaling loop between the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) and the
apical ectodermal ridge (AER). Gremlin, an extracellular BMP antagonist,
has been proposed to fulfill this function and therefore be important in
limb patterning. Khokha et al. (2003) tested this model directly by
mutating the mouse gene encoding gremlin. In the mutant limb, the
feedback loop between the ZPA and the AER was interrupted, resulting in
abnormal skeletal pattern. The phenotype is apparently identical to that
of ld, which results from a mutation in the Fmn1 gene (136535). The
relationship between Grem1 and Fmn1 is interesting because of their
proximity in the mouse genome. The Fmn1 transcript comprises a large
number of exons with the most 3-prime exon located approximately 40 kb
from the gremlin open reading frame. Given the apparently identical
phenotype of ld mice to gremlin mutant mice and the proximity of Fmn1 to
Grem1, Khokha et al. (2003) tested whether gremlin would complement ld.
They found that gremlin fails to complement ld and thus identified
another ld allele. Although a complex interaction between Fmn1 and
gremlin is possible, Khokha et al. (2003) favored the idea that the ld
mutations affect gremlin expression directly and that they lie in
cis-regulatory elements for gremlin expression.

Limb bud outgrowth is driven by signals in a positive feedback loop
involving fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) genes, Sonic hedgehog (Shh;
600725), and Grem1. Precise termination of these signals is essential to
restrict limb bud size. That the sequence in mouse limb buds is
different from that in chick limb buds drove Verheyden and Sun (2008) to
explore alternative mechanisms. By analyzing compound mouse mutants
defective in genes comprising the positive loop, Verheyden and Sun
(2008) provided genetic evidence that Fgf signaling can repress Grem1
expression, revealing a novel Fgf/Grem1 inhibitory loop. The repression
occurs in both mouse and chick limb buds and is dependent on high Fgf
activity. These data supported a mechanism where the positive Fgf/Shh
loop drives outgrowth and an increase in Fgf signaling, which triggers
the Fgf/Grem1 inhibitory loop. The inhibitory loop then operates to
terminate outgrowth signals in the order observed in either mouse or
chick limb buds. Verheyden and Sun (2008) concluded that their study
unveils the concept of a self-promoting and self-terminating circuit
that may be used to attain proper tissue size in a broad spectrum of
developmental and regenerative settings. Verheyden and Sun (2008)
demonstrated that Fgf8 (600483) repression of Fgf4 (164980) expression
is dependent on Grem1 but not Shh.

;;HEAT-SHOCK 40-KD PROTEIN 2; HSPF2;;
MCG18
DESCRIPTION The E. coli heat-shock protein DnaJ is the founding member of a family
of proteins that are associated with protein folding, complex assembly,
and export. Prokaryotic and eukaryotic DnaJ homologs contain an
approximately 70-amino acid J domain, which is thought to mediate
interaction with 70-kD heat-shock proteins (e.g., 603012). During
sequence characterization of the VEGFB (601398) promoter region in
11q13, Silins et al. (1997) identified an EST corresponding to the
3-prime untranslated region of a novel gene, HSPF2, which they named
MCG18 for 'multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 candidate gene-18.'
Silins et al. (1998) sequenced the HSPF2 gene from a cosmid and
identified additional HSPF2 ESTs. The HSPF2 gene is located
approximately 250 bp centromeric of the VEGFB gene. The HSPF2 coding
sequence is contained in 5 exons. The deduced 241-amino acid HSPF2
protein has a J domain followed by a predicted transmembrane domain. The
human and mouse HSPF2 proteins are 71% identical. Northern blot analysis
detected an approximately 1.4-kb HSPF2 transcript in all human cell
lines examined.

601982	TITLE *601982 8-@OXOGUANINE DNA GLYCOSYLASE; OGG1
;;8-@HYDROXYGUANINE DNA GLYCOSYLASE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The major mutagenic base lesion in DNA caused by exposure to reactive
oxygen species is 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG). This damaged base is excised by
a DNA glycosylase with an associated lyase activity for chain cleavage.
Lu et al. (1997), Aburatani et al. (1997), Bjoras et al. (1997),
Rosenquist et al. (1997), Radicella et al. (1997), and Roldan-Arjona et
al. (1997) cloned human cDNAs with partial sequence homology to the
yeast 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1) gene. Radicella et al. (1997)
found that the predicted protein has 345 amino acids and a calculated
molecular mass of 39 kD. Roldan-Arjona et al. (1997), who called the
enzyme 8-hydroxyguanine DNA glycosylase, estimated their 424-amino acid
predicted human enzyme to have a size of 47 kD. They showed that it
releases free 8-hydroxyguanine from oxidized DNA and introduces a chain
break in a double-stranded oligonucleotide specifically at an
8-hydroxyguanine residue base-paired with cytosine. Expression of the
human protein in a DNA repair-deficient E. coli strain partly suppressed
its spontaneous mutator phenotype. Radicella et al. (1997) showed that
when the human coding sequence was expressed in a yeast strain mutant in
Ogg1, it was able to complement the spontaneous mutator phenotype. Arai
et al. (1997) also cloned the human OGG1 gene and, by Northern blotting,
showed that the gene is ubiquitously expressed in a variety of human
organs.

Rosenquist et al. (1997) cloned both the human and mouse OGG1 genes.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Roldan-Arjona et al. (1997) and
Radicella et al. (1997) mapped the human OGG1 gene to 3p25
(3p25.3-p25.2). By the same method, Arai et al. (1997) mapped the OGG1
gene to 3p26.2. By radiation hybrid analysis, Ishida et al. (1999)
mapped the gene to 3p26, proximal to the VHL gene (608537).

GENE FUNCTION

Rosenquist et al. (1997) showed that the mouse ogg1 gene product acts
efficiently on DNA duplexes in which 8-oxodeoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) is
paired with dC, acts weakly on duplexes in which 8-oxodG is paired with
dT or dG, and is inactive against duplexes in which 8-oxodG is paired
with dA. The human, mouse, and yeast OGG1 genes contain the
helix-hairpin-helix motif characteristic of a family of DNA glycosylases
(Rosenquist et al., 1997; Arai et al., 1997).

By confocal laser microscopy, Bjoras et al. (1997) showed that OGG1 is
localized in the nucleus.

By Northern blot analysis, Kuo and Sklar (1997) found that OGG1 is
expressed as 2.0- and 1.8-kb transcripts predominantly in germinal
center B cells and tonsil and to a lesser extent in other lymphoid
cells. In situ hybridization analysis indicated that OGG1 is most
abundantly expressed in the dark zones of germinal centers. The function
and localization of OGG1 suggest that it may play a role in somatic
hypermutation of immunoglobulin genes.

Kohno et al. (1998) demonstrated that multiple isoforms of the OGG1
protein are produced in human lung cells as a result of genetic
polymorphisms and alternative splicing of the OGG1 gene. They also found
frequent loss of heterozygosity at the OGG1 locus in primary lung tumors
and an intragenic mutation of the OGG1 gene in a lung cancer cell line.

Perillo et al. (2008) analyzed how H3 histone methylation and
demethylation control expression of estrogen-responsive genes and showed
that a DNA-bound estrogen receptor (see ESRA, 133430) directs
transcription by participating in bending chromatin to contact the RNA
polymerase II (see 180660) recruited to the promoter. This process is
driven by receptor-targeted demethylation of H3K9 (see 602810) at both
enhancer and promoter sites and is achieved by activation of resident
LSD1 (609132) demethylase. Localized demethylation produces hydrogen
peroxide, which modifies the surrounding DNA and recruits
8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase 1 and topoisomerase II-beta (126431),
triggering chromatin and DNA conformational changes that are essential
for estrogen-induced transcription. Perillo et al. (2008) concluded that
their data showed a strategy that uses controlled DNA damage and repair
to guide productive transcription.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tani et al. (1998) analyzed the genomic structure of the mouse Ogg1 gene
and showed that it maps to chromosome 6. It consists of 7 exons
approximately 6 kb long, and 2 DNA-binding motifs are encoded in exons 4
through 5.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Banerjee et al. (2005) used a covalent trapping strategy to capture
human OGG1 protein in the act of interrogating normal DNA. The x-ray
structure of the trapped complex features a target G nucleobase extruded
from the DNA helix but denied insertion into the lesion recognition
pocket of the enzyme. Free energy difference calculations showed that
both the attractive and repulsive interactions have an important role in
the preferential binding of 8-oxoG compared with G to the active site.
Banerjee et al. (2005) concluded that the structure reveals an effective
gate-keeping strategy for lesion discrimination and suggests a mechanism
for 8-oxoG insertion into the human OGG1 active site.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Audebert et al. (2000) analyzed 99 renal tumors for alterations in the
OGG1 gene to determine its association with tumorigenesis. Loss of
heterozygosity in the 3p25 region was found in 85% of the informative
cases. They detected somatic missense mutations of the OGG1 gene in 4 of
the 99 tumor samples. Biochemical analysis of the mutant proteins
demonstrated that an arg46-to-gln substitution (601982.0001) impaired
the enzymatic activity. The authors also described several polymorphisms
as well as aberrantly spliced OGG1 transcripts.

In an E. coli complementation assay, Kohno et al. (1998) found that the
DNA repair activity of the cys326 variant of OGG1 is lower than that of
the ser326 variant. Wang et al. (2006) examined the association of the
ser326-to-cys (S326C) variant with insulin sensitivity in 279
glucose-tolerant Taiwanese individuals with no history of cancer.
Individuals with the cys/cys genotype had significantly lower insulin
sensitivity levels compared with the ser/ser and ser/cys genotypes (p
less than 0.001 for both). Multiple linear regression analysis showed
that the cys/cys genotype was independently and significantly associated
with the degree of insulin resistance (p = 0.001).

Kovtun et al. (2007) demonstrated that the age-dependent somatic CAG
expansion associated with Huntington disease (143100) occurs in the
process of removing oxidized base lesions, and is remarkably dependent
on the single-base excision repair enzyme 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine-DNA
glycosylase (OGG1). Both in vivo and in vitro results supported a 'toxic
oxidation' model in which OGG1 initiates an escalating
oxidation-excision cycle that leads to progressive age-dependent
expansion. Kovtun et al. (2007) concluded that age-dependent CAG
expansion provides a direct molecular link between oxidative damage and
toxicity in postmitotic neurons through a DNA damage response, and
error-prone repair of single-strand breaks.

ANIMAL MODEL

Trapp et al. (2007) stated that Ogg1 deficiency in mice leads to
elevated basal levels of 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-2-prime-deoxyguanosine
(8-oxoG) and increased spontaneous mutation frequency, although repair
of 8-oxoG is not completely abolished. To elucidate the role of CSB
(ERCC6; 609413) in preventing mutations caused by oxidative DNA base
damage, Trapp et al. (2007) generated mice deficient in Ogg1 (Ogg1 -/-),
Csb (Csb m/m, which have a truncating mutation), or both Csb and Ogg1
(Csb m/m Ogg1 -/-) that carried a nontranscribed bacterial lacI gene for
mutation analysis. The overall spontaneous mutation frequency in livers
of Csb m/m Ogg1 -/- mice were elevated compared with heterozygous
control mice and Ogg1 -/- mice. The additional mutations caused by Csb
m/m in the Ogg1 -/- background were mostly GC-to-TA transversions and
small deletions. For all mouse strains, the background levels of
oxidative purine modification in livers correlated linearly with the
number of GC-to-TA transversions. Trapp et al. (2007) concluded that CSB
inhibits spontaneous oxidative DNA base damage in nontranscribed genes.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CLEAR CELL, SOMATIC
OGG1, ARG46GLN

In a clear cell renal cell carcinoma (144700), Audebert et al. (2000)
found a 445G-A transition in the OGG1 cDNA, predicted to result in an
arg46-to-gln (R46Q) amino acid change. They demonstrated that the DNA
glycosylase/AP lyase activity was drastically reduced in the case of
this mutant; its specific activity was 4-fold lower than that of the
corresponding wildtype version, suggesting a strong impairment in its
DNA repair capacity.

300456	TITLE *300456 CYCLIN B3; CCNB3
CCNB3/BCOR FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cyclins are positive regulatory subunits of cyclin-dependent kinases
(see CDK2; 116953). CCNB3 is a mitotic cyclin that shares homology with
cyclins of the A (see 604036) and B (see CCNB1; 123836) types.

CLONING

By searching for ESTs that share homology with the C termini of Ccnb3
proteins from lower organisms, followed by RT-PCR and RACE of placenta
mRNA, Lozano et al. (2002) cloned CCNB3. The deduced full-length protein
contains 1,395 amino acids and has a calculated molecular mass of about
158 kD. The N-terminal half of CCNB3 has a destruction box, a bipartite
nuclear localization signal, and a short coiled-coil domain, and the C
terminus has a cyclin box and a leucine zipper motif. Northern blot
analysis detected a single 5.4-kb transcript expressed only in testis.
RT-PCR detected full-length CCNB3 in all tissues tested. In addition,
RT-PCR detected several CCNB3 variants, 2 of which Lozano et al. (2002)
cloned. Variant 1, which was expressed in all tissues tested, lacks a
large internal coding region and encodes a protein lacking a 1,104-amino
acid internal fragment compared with the full-length protein. Variant 2,
which was expressed in testis and liver, also lacks a large internal
coding region and, due to a frameshift, encodes a truncated protein
containing only the first 111 amino acids of the full-length protein.
Lozano et al. (2002) also identified 3 different 5-prime untranslated
sequences.

By screening for p27 (CDKN1B; 600778)-interacting proteins, Nguyen et
al. (2002) obtained a partial CCNB3 cDNA encoding a 55-kD C-terminal
fragment including the cyclin box. They cloned full-length CCNB3 by
screening a testis cDNA library. Microinjection of fluorescence-tagged
CCNB3 revealed accumulation of protein in HeLa cell nuclei.
Immunolocalization detected CCNB3 in developing germ cells. In situ
hybridization showed expression in leptotene and zygotene spermatocytes
during the first meiotic wave in adult mouse testis. Ccnb3 was also
expressed in the developing fetal ovary, but not in juvenile ovary.

GENE FUNCTION

Nguyen et al. (2002) found that in vitro translated CCNB3 bound CDK2 but
failed to activate its histone H1 (see 142709) kinase activity. CCNB3
was degraded during anaphase entry after the degradation of CCNB1, and
degradation was dependent on sequences conserved in the destruction box
motif. Overexpression of nondegradable CCNB3 blocked the mitotic cell
cycle in late anaphase and, at higher doses, interfered with progression
through G1 and entry into S phase.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lozano et al. (2002) determined that the CCNB3 gene contains 15 exons
and spans more than 76 kb. The initiation codon is located within exon
5. Exon 8 is unusually long and encodes the sequence between the
destruction box and the cyclin box.

CYTOGENETICS

Pierron et al. (2012) used high-throughput sequencing of cDNAs (RNA-seq)
to investigate samples from individuals diagnosed with small round cell
tumors of bone that lacked the canonical EWSR1/ETS translocation
(133450). A new fusion was observed between BCOR (300485) and CCNB3 on
the X chromosome. RNA-seq results were confirmed by RT-PCR and through
cloning of the tumor-specific genomic translocation breakpoints. In
total, 24 BCOR/CCNB3-positive tumors were identified among a series of
594 sarcoma cases. Gene profiling experiments indicated that
BCOR/CCNB3-positive cases are biologically distinct from other sarcomas,
particularly Ewing sarcoma (612219). Pierron et al. (2012) also showed
that CCNB3 immunohistochemistry is a powerful diagnostic marker for this
subgroup of sarcoma and that overexpression of BCOR/CCNB3 or of
truncated CCNB3 activates S phase in NIH3T3 cells.

MAPPING

By FISH and genomic sequence analysis, Lozano et al. (2002) mapped the
CCNB3 gene to chromosome Xp11.22. CCNB3 lies close to the AKAP4 gene
(300185) and is transcribed in the opposite direction.

165370	TITLE *165370 RAS HOMOLOG GENE FAMILY, MEMBER B; RHOB
;;APLYSIA RAS-RELATED HOMOLOG 6; ARH6;;
ARHB;;
ONCOGENE RHO H6; RHOH6
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

A family of RAS proteins, originally designated RHO proteins, were
identified and isolated from protein products expressed in the marine
snail, Aplysia (Madaule and Axel, 1985). In humans, the products of
these genes, called ARH (Aplysia ras-related homologs), display striking
homology to the products of the classic RAS genes. Madaule and Axel
(1985) identified 3 classes of ARH genes, designated H6, H9 (RHOC;
165380), and H12 (RHOA; 165390). Chardin et al. (1988) reported the
complete H6 coding sequence and renamed the gene RhoB. The predicted
protein is 196 amino acids long.

GENE FUNCTION

Ridley and Hall (1992) showed that Rho stimulates actin stress fiber
production and the formation of focal adhesions when it is microinjected
into serum-starved Swiss 3T3 cells. Addition of serum or growth factors
such as PDGF also induced actin reorganization and stress fibers, but
when Rho was inhibited focal adhesion and stress fiber assembly were
impaired.

The actin cytoskeleton undergoes extensive remodeling during cell
morphogenesis and motility. The small guanosine triphosphatase Rho
regulates such remodeling. In their Figure 3C, Maekawa et al. (1999)
diagrammed proposed signaling pathways for Rho-induced remodeling of the
actin cytoskeleton. They demonstrated that LIM kinase (see 601329) is
phosphorylated and activated by ROCK (601702), a downstream effector of
Rho, and that LIM kinase, in turn, phosphorylates cofilin (601442).

Sandilands et al. (2004) found that RhoB colocalized with active Src
(190090) in the cytoplasm of mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and they
presented evidence that RhoB is a component of 'outside-in' signaling
pathways that coordinate Src activation with translocation to
transmembrane receptors.

MAPPING

By a combination of Southern analysis of somatic cell hybrid panels and
in situ hybridization, Cannizzaro et al. (1990) mapped the genes RHOB to
2pter-p12, ARH12 (RHOA) to 3p21, and ARH9 (RHOC) to 5q31-qter.

606113	TITLE *606113 PROCESSING OF PRECURSOR 7, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; POP7
;;RIBONUCLEASE P, 20-KD SUBUNIT; RPP20
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ribonuclease P (RNase P) removes the 5-prime leader sequences from
precursor tRNA molecules. RNase P consists of an RNA species (H1 RNA),
the POP1 protein (602486), and at least 7 proteins called RPPs. The RPPs
have apparent molecular masses of 14 kD (RPP14; 606112), 20 kD (RPP20),
25 kD (RPP25), 29 kD (RPP29; 606114), 30 kD (RPP30; 606115), 38 kD
(RPP38; 606116), and 40 kD (RPP40; 606117). Patients with scleroderma
(181750) have serum reactive with RNase P, the Th antigen, which is also
referred to as the To antigen, and RPP30 and RPP38 (summary by Jarrous
et al., 1998, 1999).

CLONING

By biochemical purification of RNase P, micropeptide sequence analysis,
and EST database searching, Jarrous et al. (1998) obtained a cDNA
encoding RPP20. The deduced protein contains 140 amino acids with a
predicted molecular mass of nearly 16 kD. Immunologic analysis
determined that RPP20, unlike RPP30 and RPP38, is not a target for
antisera from systemic sclerosis patients. Immunoprecipitation analysis
showed that polyclonal antibodies raised against RPP20, RPP30, RPP38, or
RPP40 interact with RNase P from HeLa cells.

MAPPING

Gross (2013) mapped the POP7 gene to chromosome 7q22.1 based on an
alignment of the POP7 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC001430) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

600516	TITLE *600516 BCL2 ANTAGONIST KILLER 1; BAK1
;;BAK;;
BCL2L7
BAK-LIKE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The BCL2 oncogene (151430), which is activated in follicular lymphomas,
functions as a potent suppressor of apoptosis under diverse conditions.
Chittenden et al. (1995) and Kiefer et al. (1995) described the cDNA
cloning of a novel BCL2 homolog, BAK.

Kim et al. (2004) identified a 101-amino acid splice variant of BAK1,
which they called BAK-like, that contains BH1, BH2, and TM domains, but
lacks a BH3 domain. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.4-kb transcript
in most human tissues and cell lines examined. Confocal microscopy
studies localized the variant to a diffuse cytosolic pattern that
redistributed to a mitochondrial staining pattern upon apoptosis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Herberg et al. (1998) found that the BAK1 gene spans 7.6 kb and contains
6 exons. The first exon is noncoding, and most of the largest, final
exon is untranslated.

MAPPING

By Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA from human/rodent somatic cell
hybrids, Kiefer et al. (1995) localized the BAK gene to chromosome 6.
Ulrich et al. (1997) mapped the mouse homolog of BAK1 to chromosome 17
in region B by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Because of the
location of the bak gene on mouse chromosome 17, the human BAK1 gene was
expected to be located on 6p. By FISH, Herberg et al. (1998) mapped the
BAK1 gene to 6p21.3.

GENE FUNCTION

Chittenden et al. (1995) and Kiefer et al. (1995) described the
functional analysis of BAK, which promotes cell death and counteracts
the protection from apoptosis provided by BCL2. Chittenden et al. (1995)
found that enforced expression of BAK induced rapid and extensive
apoptosis of serum-deprived fibroblasts. This suggested that BAK may be
directly involved in activating the cell death machinery. Kiefer et al.
(1995) pointed out that, like BAX (600040), the BAK gene product
primarily enhances apoptotic cell death following an appropriate
stimulus. Unlike BAX, however, BAK can inhibit cell death in an
Epstein-Barr virus-transformed cell line.

During transduction of an apoptotic signal into the cell, there is an
alteration in the permeability of the membranes of the cell's
mitochondria, which causes the translocation of the apoptogenic protein
cytochrome c into the cytoplasm, which in turn activates death-driving
proteolytic proteins known as caspases (see 147678). The BCL2 family of
proteins, whose members may be antiapoptotic or proapoptotic, regulates
cell death by controlling this mitochondrial membrane permeability
during apoptosis. Shimizu et al. (1999) created liposomes that carried
the mitochondrial porin channel VDAC (604492) to show that the
recombinant proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bak accelerate the opening of
VDAC, whereas the antiapoptotic protein BCLXL (600039) closes VDAC by
binding to it directly. Bax and Bak allow cytochrome c to pass through
VDAC out of liposomes, but passage is prevented by BCLXL. In agreement
with this, VDAC1-deficient mitochondria from a mutant yeast did not
exhibit a Bax/Bak-induced loss in membrane potential and cytochrome c
release, both of which were inhibited by BCLXL. Shimizu et al. (1999)
concluded that the BCL2 family of proteins bind to the VDAC in order to
regulate the mitochondrial membrane potential and the release of
cytochrome c during apoptosis.

The caspase-activated form of BID (601997), tBID, triggers the
homooligomerization of multidomain conserved proapoptotic family members
BAK or BAX, resulting in the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria.
Wei et al. (2001) found that cells lacking both BAK and BAX, but not
cells lacking only one of these components, are completely resistant to
tBID-induced cytochrome c release and apoptosis. Moreover, doubly
deficient cells are resistant to multiple apoptotic stimuli that act
through disruption of mitochondrial function: staurosporine, ultraviolet
radiation, growth factor deprivation, etoposide, and the endoplasmic
reticulum stress stimuli thapsigargin and tunicamycin. Thus, Wei et al.
(2001) concluded that activation of a 'multidomain' proapoptotic member,
BAK or BAX, appears to be an essential gateway to mitochondrial
dysfunction required for cell death in response to diverse stimuli.

Cheng et al. (2003) found that in viable cells, BAK complexed with the
mitochondrial outer membrane protein VDAC2 (193245), a VDAC isoform
present in low abundance that interacts specifically with the inactive
conformer of BAK. Cells deficient in VDAC2, but not cells lacking the
more abundant VDAC1, exhibited enhanced BAK oligomerization and were
more susceptible to apoptotic death. Conversely, overexpression of VDAC2
selectively prevented BAK activation and inhibited the mitochondrial
apoptotic pathway. Death signals activate 'BH3-only' molecules such as
tBID, BIM (603827), or BAD (603167), which displace VDAC2 from BAK,
enabling homooligomerization of BAK and apoptosis. Thus, Cheng et al.
(2003) concluded that VDAC2, an isoform restricted to mammals, regulates
the activity of BAK and provides a connection between mitochondrial
physiology and the core apoptotic pathway.

Fannjiang et al. (2003) examined the ability of Bak1-null and
Bak1-overexpressing mice to resist various neuronal injuries, including
neuronotropic Sindbis virus infection, Parkinson disease,
ischemia/stroke, and seizure. The results showed that Bak1 could promote
or inhibit neuronal death depending on the specific death stimulus and
the maturity of the animal. Bak1 protected immature mice and neurons
from Sindbis virus and excitotoxic stimuli. Deletion of the hydrophobic
C terminus converted Bak1 from an antiapoptotic to a proapoptotic
protein. In older mice, Bak1 could be anti- or proapoptotic depending on
the neuronal subtype and the neuronal injury. Bak1 protected older mice
from excitotoxic cell death and seizure, but it promoted Sindbis virus
toxicity. Bak1-deficient adult mice showed enhanced sensitivity to
kainate-induced seizures, and this increased sensitivity was associated
with reduced neurotransmitter release from inhibitory GABAergic nerve
terminals and increased release from excitatory glutamatergic neurons,
indicating that BAK1 modifies synaptic activity of hippocampal neurons.

The p53 protein (191170) is an important proapoptotic regulator. Leu et
al. (2004) found that after cell stress, p53 interacted with BAK. This
interaction caused oligomerization of BAK and release of cytochrome c
from mitochondria. Formation of the p53-BAK complex coincided with loss
of an interaction between BAK and the antiapoptotic protein MCL1
(159552). Leu et al. (2004) suggested that p53 and MCL1 have opposing
effects on mitochondrial apoptosis by modulating BAK activity.

Hetz et al. (2006) investigated the unfolded protein response signaling
events in mice in the absence of proapoptotic BCL2 family members Bax
(600040) and Bak using double-knockout mice. Double-knockout mice
responded abnormally to tunicamycin-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
stress in the liver, with extensive tissue damage and decreased
expression of the IRE1 substrate X box-binding protein-1 (XBP1; 194355)
and its target genes. ER-stressed double-knockout cells showed deficient
Ire1-alpha (604033) signaling. Bax and Bak formed a protein complex with
the cytosolic domain of Ire1-alpha that was essential for Ire1-alpha
activation. Thus, Hetz et al. (2006) concluded that BAX and BAK function
at the ER membrane to activate IRE1-alpha signaling and to provide a
physical link between members of the core apoptotic pathway and the
unfolded protein response.

Two members of the BCL2 family, BAX and BAK, change intracellular
location early in the promotion of apoptosis to concentrate in focal
clusters at sites of mitochondrial division. Karbowski et al. (2006)
reported that in healthy cells, BAX or BAK is required for normal fusion
of mitochondria into elongated tubules. BAX seems to induce
mitochondrial fusion by activating assembly of the large GTPase MFN2
(608507) and changing its submitochondrial distribution and membrane
mobility--properties that correlate with different GTP-bound states of
MFN2. Karbowski et al. (2006) concluded that BAX and BAK regulate
mitochondrial dynamics in healthy cells and that BCL2 family members may
also regulate apoptosis through organelle morphogenesis machineries.

A central issue in the regulation of apoptosis by the BCL2 family is
whether its BH3-only members initiate apoptosis by directly binding to
the essential cell death mediators BAX and BAK, or whether they can act
indirectly, by engaging their prosurvival BCL2-like relatives. Contrary
to the direct-activation model, Willis et al. (2007) showed that BAX and
BAK can mediate apoptosis without discernable association with the
putative BH3-only activators (BIM, 603827; BID, 601997; and PUMA,
605854), even in cells with no BIM or BID and reduced PUMA. Willis et
al. (2007) concluded that BH3-only proteins induce apoptosis at least
primarily by engaging with multiple prosurvival relatives guarding BAX
and BAK.

Liver is generally refractory to apoptosis induced by p53. Leu and
George (2007) found that p53 activation led to enhanced expression of
IGFBP1 (146730) in human hepatoma cells. A portion of intracellular
IGFBP1 localized to mitochondria, where it bound the proapoptotic
protein BAK. Binding of IGFBP1 to BAK impaired formation of the
proapoptotic p53/BAK complex and induction of apoptosis in cultured
human and mouse cells and in mouse liver. In contrast, livers of
Igfbp1-deficient mice exhibited spontaneous apoptosis accompanied by p53
mitochondrial accumulation and evidence of Bak oligomerization. Leu and
George (2007) concluded that IGFBP1 is a negative regulator of the
p53/BAK-dependent pathway of apoptosis.

BHRF1 is a prosurvival molecule from Epstein-Barr virus that is
homologous to BCL2. Desbien et al. (2009) showed that, in mouse T cells,
BHRF1 bound Bak, and that in cell cultures without cytokines, BHRF1
associated with Bim. BHRF1 with a point mutation in its BH3-binding
groove that eliminated binding to Bak retained its ability to bind Bim
and to protect cells. Desbien et al. (2009) concluded that binding of
BHRF1 to BIM, rather than BAK, provides protection.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

For discussion of a possible association between variation in the BAK1
gene and testicular germ cell tumors, see 273300.

ANIMAL MODEL

Proapoptotic Bcl2 family members have been proposed to play a central
role in regulating apoptosis, yet mice lacking Bax display limited
phenotypic abnormalities. Lindsten et al. (2000) found that Bak -/- mice
were developmentally normal and reproductively fit and failed to develop
any age-related disorders. However, when Bak-deficient mice were mated
to Bax-deficient mice to create mice lacking both genes, the majority of
Bax-/- Bak-/- animals died perinatally, with fewer than 10% surviving
into adulthood. Bax-/- Bak-/- mice displayed multiple developmental
defects, including persistence of interdigital webs, an imperforate
vaginal canal, and accumulation of excess cells within both the central
nervous and hematopoietic systems. Thus, the authors concluded that Bax
and Bak have overlapping roles in the regulation of apoptosis during
mammalian development and tissue homeostasis.

Scorrano et al. (2003) found that mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient
for Bax (600040) and Bak had a reduced resting concentration of calcium
in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that resulted in decreased uptake of
calcium by mitochondria after calcium release from the ER. Expression of
SERCA (sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum calcium adenosine
triphosphatase; see 108740) corrected ER calcium concentration and
mitochondrial calcium uptake in double knockout cells, restoring
apoptotic death in response to agents that release calcium from
intracellular stores, such as arachidonic acid, C2-ceramide, and
oxidative stress. In contrast, targeting of Bax to mitochondria
selectively restored apoptosis to 'BH3-only' signals. A third set of
stimuli, including many intrinsic signals, required both ER-released
calcium and the presence of mitochondrial Bax or Bak to fully restore
apoptosis. Scorrano et al. (2003) concluded that BAX and BAK operate in
both the ER and the mitochondria as an essential gateway for selected
apoptotic signals.

Takeuchi et al. (2005) generated mice conditionally deficient in both
Bax and Bak in B cells, but not T cells, and compared them with Bim -/-
mice. Deletion of Bak and Bax in B cells caused accumulation of immature
and mature follicular B cells and abrogation of apoptosis, whereas Bim
deficiency caused accumulation of mature splenic B cells only and
partial resistance to apoptosis. B cells from the Bax- and Bak-deficient
mice were also defective in cell cycling in response to B-cell receptor
crosslinking and lipopolysaccharide. Induced Bax and Bak deficiency in
adult mice resulted in development of severe autoimmune glomerular
nephritis. Takeuchi et al. (2005) concluded that BAX and BAK are
essential for apoptosis and maintenance of B-cell homeostasis.

The C57BL/6J mouse strain shows a classic pattern of age-related hearing
loss (612448) by 12 to 15 months of age. Someya et al. (2009) found that
mice with deletion in the Bak gene had significantly less age-related
hearing loss compared to wildtype mice. Preservation of hearing was
associated with reduced oxidative stress-induced apoptosis of spiral
ganglion cells and cochlear hair cells. Bax-null mice did not show such
resistance to hearing loss. In vitro studies on primary cochlear cells
showed that oxidative stress was associated with overexpression of Bak
and apoptosis. Oral supplementation of wildtype mice with the
mitochondrial antioxidants alpha-lipoic acid and coenzyme Q10 suppressed
Bak expression in the cochlea, reduced cochlear cell death, and
prevented age-related hearing loss. Someya et al. (2009) suggested that
BAK is required for the development of age-related hearing loss, and
that induction of a BAK-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis program in
response to oxidative stress is a key pathogenic mechanism.

Ren et al. (2010) provided in vivo evidence demonstrating an essential
role of the proteins BID (601997), BIM (603827), and PUMA (605854) in
activating BAX and BAK. Bid, Bim, and Puma triple-knockout mice showed
the same developmental defects that are associated with deficiency of
Bax and Bak, including persistent interdigital webs and imperforate
vaginas. Genetic deletion of Bid, Bim, and Puma prevented the
homooligomerization of Bax and Bak, and thereby cytochrome c
(123970)-mediated activation of caspases in response to diverse death
signals in neurons and T lymphocytes, despite the presence of other
BH3-only molecules. Thus, Ren et al. (2010) concluded that many forms of
apoptosis require direct activation of BAX and BAK at the mitochondria
by a member of the BID, BIM, or PUMA family of proteins.

277700	TITLE #277700 WERNER SYNDROME; WRN
DESCRIPTION A number sign (#) is used with this entry because Werner syndrome has
been found to be caused by mutations in the RECQL2 gene (604611), which
encodes a homolog of the E. coli RecQ DNA helicase.

See also Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS; 176670), a more
severe progeroid syndrome with earlier onset caused by mutation in the
LMNA gene (150330).

CLINICAL FEATURES

The features of Werner syndrome are scleroderma-like skin changes,
especially in the extremities, cataract, subcutaneous calcification,
premature arteriosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, and a wizened and
prematurely aged facies. A particularly instructive pedigree was
reported by McKusick (1963). The habitus is characteristic, with short
stature, slender limbs, and stocky trunk. The nose is beaked.

Epstein et al. (1966) studied a Japanese patient living in Seattle. Goto
et al. (1981) studied 42 Japanese families containing 80 affected
persons. Autosomal recessive inheritance was confirmed. Malignancy was
frequent in the patients and in the families generally. HLA was not
linked. The frequency of Werner syndrome in Japan was estimated to be
about 3 per million persons. The origin of the grandparents of the cases
would be of interest.

Khraishi et al. (1992) described a 47-year-old woman who had been
misdiagnosed as having progressive systemic sclerosis with metastatic
calcification for 12 years and then developed a painful, distal femoral,
osteoblastic cortical juxtaarticular lesion with exuberant soft tissue
calcification. This lesion proved to be an osteosarcoma requiring
amputation. Ruprecht (1989) reported that in 10 of 18 eyes from 9
patients with Werner syndrome, cataract surgery was complicated by wound
dehiscence and its consequences. Additionally, corneal endothelial
decompensation occurred in 8 eyes. In view of the reduced growth
potential of fibroblasts, he suggested small surgical incisions and
other modifications of the usual procedures of cataract surgery,
including no local or systemic use of cortisone.

Martin (1997) gave a thoughtful review of the question of whether the
Werner mutation is a bona fide reflection of mechanisms of 'normal
aging.'

Mohaghegh and Hickson (2001) reviewed the DNA helicase deficiencies
associated with cancer predisposition and premature aging disorders.

Goto et al. (1996) found in the literature 124 case reports of neoplasia
and Werner syndrome from Japan and 34 case reports from outside Japan,
from 1939 to 1995. They found a greater diversity of neoplasia in WRN
than was previously known. In Japanese, there were 127 cancers, 14
benign meningiomas, and 5 myeloid disorders, as compared with 30
cancers, 7 benign meningiomas, and 2 myeloid disorders, in non-Japanese.
The ratio of epithelial to nonepithelial cancers was about 1:1 for
Japanese and for non-Japanese, instead of the usual 10:1. Both series
had excesses of soft tissue sarcoma (STS), osteosarcoma, myeloid
disorders, and benign meningioma. In addition, the Japanese had an
excess of thyroid cancer and melanoma, including 5 intranasal and 13
foot. STS, osteosarcoma, melanoma, and thyroid carcinoma accounted for
57% of all cancer in WRN as compared with an expected 2%, based on the
Osaka population between 25 and 64 years of age. Multiple tumors were
reported in 19 Japanese and 5 non-Japanese. In Japan, 9 first-degree
relatives had WRN and cancer, 6 of whom were concordant as to site
and/or cell type.

OTHER FEATURES

- Chromosomal Instability in Werner Syndrome

'Variegated translocation mosaicism' was the designation proposed by W.
W. Nichols (Hoehn et al., 1975) for a phenomenon he and others observed
in cells from patients with Werner syndrome: skin fibroblast cell lines
were usually composed of one or several clones, each marked by a
distinctive, apparently balanced translocation. Salk (1982) found that
somatic cells from Werner syndrome patients reveal a propensity to
develop chromosomal aberrations, including translocations, inversions,
and deletions. In fibroblast cell lines and lymphoblastoid cell lines
made from circulating B lymphocytes in 2 brothers born of first-cousin
parents, Schonberg et al. (1984) demonstrated variegated translocation
mosaicism as well as the abbreviated life span characteristic of cell
lines from these patients.

In studies with clastogens, Gebhart et al. (1988) concluded that Werner
syndrome cells demonstrate some biochemical differences that
distinguishing them from those of other classic chromosome instability
syndromes.

Fukuchi et al. (1989) demonstrated increased frequency of chromosomal
deletions in cell lines from patients with WRN. Scappaticci et al.
(1990) found multiple numerical and structural chromosomal abnormalities
in cultured lymphocytes of 4 patients with Werner syndrome; several of
the changes were clonal.

Fukuchi et al. (1990) found an 8-fold higher average frequency of
6-thioguanine-resistant lymphocytes in Werner syndrome patients compared
to normal controls, suggesting there were increased spontaneous
chromosome rearrangements and deletions in WRN cells consistent with a
human genomic instability or 'mutator' syndrome. Monnat et al. (1992)
determined the junction region sequences of deletions in the HPRT gene
(308000) from thioguanine-resistant Werner syndrome fibroblasts. Given
the potential for homologous recombination between copies of repeated
DNA sequences that constitute approximately a third of the human HPRT
gene, they were surprised to discover that all the deletions were
generated by nonhomologous recombination of donor DNA duplexes that
share little nucleotide sequence identity. No difference in structure or
complexity was observed between deletions isolated from Werner syndrome
fibroblasts or from myeloid leukemia cells. This suggested to Monnat et
al. (1992) that the Werner syndrome deletion mutator uses deletion
mutagenesis pathways that are similar or identical to those used in
other human somatic cells.

Ogburn et al. (1997) found that immortalized B lymphocytes from
individuals with Werner syndrome were hypersensitive to
4-nitro-quinoline-1-oxide (4NQO), supporting earlier work on T
lymphocytes. They also showed that B cell lines from clinically normal
heterozygous carriers, with approximately 50% residual helicase
activity, exhibited intermediate sensitivities to this genotoxic agent.
Since the prevalence of carriers is as high as 1 in 150 to 1 in 200,
Ogburn et al. (1997) suggested that a deleterious phenotype associated
with a carrier state could have potential public health concern. Moser
et al. (2000) used the glycophorin A (GPA) somatic cell mutation assay
(Jensen and Bigbee, 1996) to analyze genetic instability in vivo in WRN
patients and heterozygotes. GPA variant frequencies were determined for
11 patients and 10 heterozygous family members who collectively carried
10 different WRN mutations. An increase in variant frequency was
strongly age-dependent in WRN patients. Allele loss variants were also
significantly elevated in heterozygous family members, thus providing
the first evidence for in vivo genetic instability in heterozygous
carriers in an autosomal recessive genetic instability syndrome.

Prince et al. (1999) showed that Werner syndrome fibroblast cell lines
are unusually sensitive to the DNA-damaging agent 4NQO, although not to
gamma radiation or to hydrogen peroxide. The fusion of 4NQO-sensitive
WRN and 4NQO-resistant control fibroblast cell lines generated
proliferating cell hybrids that expressed WRN protein and were
4NQO-resistant. These results established the recessive nature of 4NQO
sensitivity in WRN cell lines and provided a cellular assay for WRN
protein function.

Crabbe et al. (2007) demonstrated that replication-associated telomere
loss was responsible for chromosome fusions found in Werner syndrome
fibroblasts. Using metaphase analysis, the authors showed that telomere
elongation by telomerase (TERT; 187270) significantly reduced the
appearance of new chromosomal aberrations in cells lacking the WRN
helicase, similar to complementation of Werner syndrome cells with the
WRN helicase. Crabbe et al. (2007) proposed a mechanism in which lack of
WRN helicase activity results in dramatic telomere loss from individual
sister chromatids, causing a DNA damage and repair response that leads
to chromosome fusion-breakage cycles and genomic instability. The
findings suggested that genome instability in Werner syndrome cells,
which may lead to cancer, depends directly on telomere dysfunction.

PATHOGENESIS

Bauer et al. (1986) found that fibroblasts from a patient with Werner
syndrome had a markedly attenuated mitogenic response to
platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF; see 190040) and fibroblast growth
factor (FGF; see 131220) despite normal cellular growth factor binding
and receptors. The findings suggested that a defect in growth
factor-mediated pathways may contribute to the WRN phenotype.

The finite replicative life span of human cells in vitro, the Hayflick
phenomenon (Hayflick, 1965), is due to the stochastic loss of
replicative ability in a continuously increasing fraction of newborn
cells at every generation. Normal human fibroblasts achieve
approximately 60 population doublings in culture, while Werner syndrome
cells usually achieve only about 20 population doublings. There are 2
alternative kinetic explanations for the decreased life span of Werner
syndrome cells. First, the initial fraction of cycling cells in a fresh
explant may be approximately the same as in an explant derived from a
normal subject, but the rate of loss of reproductive ability may be much
higher in Werner syndrome cells. Second, when freshly explanted, the
Werner syndrome cells may contain a much smaller fraction of cycling
cells, which lose their reproductive ability at a normal rate. Of
course, a combination of the 2 mechanisms is possible. To distinguish
between the 2 main hypotheses, Faragher et al. (1993) studied cells from
an obligate heterozygote, determining the fraction of cells in S phase
throughout the life span of cultures. They found that the cells in these
cultures usually exited, apparently irreversibly, from the cell cycle at
a faster rate than did normal cells, although for the most part they
started off with good replicative ability. They proposed that the Werner
syndrome gene is a 'counting' gene controlling the number of times that
human cells are able to divide before terminal differentiation. Thweatt
and Goldstein (1993) arrived at a similar hypothesis. They pointed out
that several overexpressed gene sequences isolated from a Werner
syndrome fibroblast cDNA library possessed the capacity to inhibit DNA
synthesis and disrupt many normal biochemical processes. Because a
similar constellation of genes is overexpressed in senescent normal
fibroblasts, the findings suggested a common molecular genetic pathway
for replicative senescence in the 2 types of cells. Thweatt and
Goldstein (1993) proposed that the primary defect in WRN is a mutation
in a gene for a trans-acting repressor protein that reduces its binding
affinity for shared regulatory regions of several genes, including those
that encode inhibitors of DNA synthesis. The mutant WRN repressor gene
triggers a sequence of premature expression of inhibitors of DNA
synthesis and other genes, with resulting inhibition of DNA synthesis
and early cellular senescence, events that occur much later in normal
cells.

Matsumoto et al. (1997) presented evidence that the helicase that is
defective in Werner syndrome is missing the nuclear localization signal
(NLS) and that this leads to impaired nuclear import as a major
contributing factor in the molecular pathology of the disorder. The
finding helped to explain the enigma that most Werner syndrome patients
have similar clinical phenotypes no matter how different their
mutations. The role the Werner syndrome helicase plays in the nucleus in
preventing premature aging remained to be clarified.

Wyllie et al. (2000) showed that forced expression of telomerase
(187270) in Werner syndrome fibroblasts conferred extended cellular life
span and probable immortality. Telomerase activity and telomere
extension was is sufficient to prevent premature senescence of Werner
syndrome fibroblast cultures. The findings suggested that one
consequence of the Werner syndrome defect is an acceleration of normal
telomere-driven replicative senescence, and suggested a route to
therapeutic intervention in this human progeroid syndrome.

Krejci et al. (2003) clarified the role of Srs2 in recombination
modulation by purifying its encoded product and examining its
interactions with the RAD51 recombinase (179617). Srs2 has a robust
ATPase activity that is dependent on single-stranded DNA and binds
RAD51, but the addition of a catalytic quantity of Srs2 to
RAD51-mediated recombination reactions causes severe inhibition of these
reactions. Krejci et al. (2003) showed that Srs2 acts by dislodging
RAD51 from single-stranded DNA. Thus, the attenuation of recombination
efficiency by Srs2 stems primarily from its ability to dismantle the
RAD51 presynaptic filament efficiently. Krejci et al. (2003) suggested
that their findings have implications for the basis of Bloom (210900)
and Werner syndromes, which are caused by mutations in DNA helicases and
are characterized by increased frequencies of recombination and a
predisposition to cancers and accelerated aging.

Baird et al. (2004) showed that the mean rate of telomere shortening in
WRN bulk cultures ranged between that of normal fibroblasts (99
bp/population doubling) and 4 times that of normal (355 bp/population
doubling). Telomere erosion rates in clones of WRN cells were much
reduced compared with bulk cultures, as were the variances of the
telomere length distributions. The overall lack of length heterogeneity
and the normal erosion rates of the clonal populations were consistent
with simple end-replication losses as the major contributor to telomere
erosion in WRN cells. The authors proposed that telomere dynamics at the
single-cell level in WRN fibroblasts are not significantly different
from those in normal fibroblasts, and suggested that the accelerated
replicative decline seen in WRN fibroblasts may not result from
accelerated telomere erosion.

CLINICAL MANAGEMENT

Because insulin resistance in Werner syndrome may be due to defective
signaling distal to the insulin receptor (147670), Izumino et al. (1997)
analyzed the metabolic effects of troglitazone, an antidiabetic drug
that sensitizes insulin action, in 5 patients with Werner syndrome. Each
patient was treated with 400 mg/day of troglitazone for 4 weeks and
underwent a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and frequently
sampled iv glucose tolerance tests. Treatment reduced the area under the
curve of glucose and insulin in the OGTT by 26% and 43%, respectively.
Glucose tolerance, expressed as the glucose disappearance rate, improved
significantly (1.36 +/- 0.16 to 1.94 +/- 0.30%/min; P less than 0.005).
The authors found that troglitazone ameliorates glucose intolerance
mediated by increased insulin sensitivity as well as glucose
effectiveness, as assessed by minimal analysis, in Werner syndrome
patients.

MAPPING

In a study of 21 Japanese families originating in 16 different
prefectures, Goto et al. (1992) did linkage studies demonstrating close
linkage of WRN to a group of markers on chromosome 8. At least 3 of the
4 following major signs were required for the diagnosis: characteristic
habitus and stature, premature senescence, scleroderma-like skin
changes, and endocrine abnormalities. The first suggestion of linkage
was increased homozygosity for ankyrin (ANK1; 612641) and D8S87. The
ANK1 locus is located at 8p11.2. The Werner syndrome showed a maximum
lod score of 2.89 at theta = 0.058 for linkage with ANK1. A multipoint
lod score of 9.92 was obtained for the linkage of Werner syndrome with 3
markers. No linkage was found with lipoprotein lipase (238600) and other
evidence suggested that this locus lies closer to 8pter than does the
Werner syndrome locus. A likely location for the WRN gene appeared to be
8p12-p11. Schellenberg et al. (1992) confirmed the assignment by
homozygosity mapping, i.e., linkage analysis using affected individuals
from first- or second-cousin marriages. A peak lod score of 5.58 at a
recombination fraction of 0.03 was obtained with D8S87.

By linkage studies, Thomas et al. (1993) determined that the heregulin
locus (142445) is distal to WRN and that ANK1 and PLAT (173370) are in
that order on the centromeric side of WRN.

Nakura et al. (1994) studied 27 Werner syndrome kindreds of various
ethnic origins, 26 of which were consanguineous. In 24 of these
families, the affected subject was given the diagnosis of definite
Werner syndrome and affected subjects in the remaining 3 pedigrees were
given the diagnosis of probable Werner syndrome. With 2-point linkage
analysis using 13 short tandem repeat polymorphic sites on 8p, Nakura et
al. (1994) found that the locus yielding a maximum lod score at the
smallest recombination fraction was D8S339. Lod scores in excess of 3.0
were obtained with this marker for both Japanese and Caucasian families.
Multipoint analysis of the markers yielded a maximum lod score of 17.05
at a distance of approximately 0.6 cM from D8S339. Combined with the
analysis of homozygosity in subjects from inbred pedigrees, the data
indicated that the WRN locus is between D8S131 and D8S87, in an 8.3-cM
interval containing D8S339.

Yu et al. (1994) used linkage disequilibrium in an attempt to narrow
down the location of the WRN gene. They found that D8S339 and 2
polymorphisms at the glutathione reductase locus (138300) showed strong
statistically significant evidence of disequilibrium with WRN in the
Japanese population but not in the Caucasian population. In addition,
they showed that a limited number of haplotypes are associated with the
disease in both populations and that these haplotypes define clusters of
apparently related haplotypes that may identify as many as 8 or 9
independent WRN mutations in these 2 populations.

Ye et al. (1995) used homozygosity mapping with markers derived from an
8p22-p12 microdissection library to type members of Japanese families
with WRN. One marker, MS8-134 (D8S1055), showed a lod score of over 20
at theta = 0.00.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Yu et al. (1996) identified 4 mutations in in the WRN gene in patients
with Werner syndrome. Two of the mutations (604611.0003 and 604611.0004)
were splice-junction mutations with the predicted result being the
exclusion of exons from the final messenger RNA. One of these mutations
(604611.0004), which resulted in a frameshift and a predicted truncated
protein, was found in the homozygous state in 60% of Japanese Werner
syndrome patients examined. The other 2 mutations were nonsense
mutations (604611.0001 and 604611.0002). The identification of a mutated
putative helicase as the gene product of the WRN gene suggested to Yu et
al. (1996) that defective DNA metabolism is involved in a complex
process of aging in Werner syndrome patients.

Oshima et al. (1996) reported 9 new WRN mutations in 10 Werner syndrome
patients, including 4 Japanese patients and 6 Caucasian patients. These
mutations were located at different sites across the coding region.
Oshima et al. (1996) noted that all of the WRN mutations found to date
either create a stop codon or cause frameshifts that lead to premature
terminations. They noted that the WRN protein is partially homologous to
RecQ helicases and that it contains 7 helicase motifs, 2 of which have
been found in all ATP-binding proteins. Oshima et al. (1996) briefly
reviewed the functions of helicases and reported that DNA helicases have
been implicated in a number of molecular processes, including unwinding
of DNA during replication, DNA repair, and accurate chromosomal
segregation.

Goto et al. (1997) studied the helicase gene mutations previously
described by Yu et al. (1996) in 89 Japanese Werner syndrome patients.
Thirty-five (39.3%) were homozygous for mutation 4 (604611.0004); 1
(1.1%) was homozygous for mutation 1 (604611.0001); 6 (6.7%) were
positive for both mutations 1 and 4; 1 was homozygous for a new
mutation, which they designated mutation 5 (604611.0005); 13 (14.6%) had
a single copy of mutation 4; 3 (3.4%) had a single copy of mutation 1;
and the remaining 30 (33.8%) were negative for all 5 mutations. Of the
178 chromosomes in the 89 patients, 89 (50%) carried mutation 4, 11
(6.2%) carried mutation 1, and 2 (1.1%) carried mutation 5. In 76
chromosomes (42.7%), no mutation was identified.

Yu et al. (1997) screened Werner syndrome subjects for mutations and
identified 5 new ones. Four of these new mutations either partially
disrupted the helicase domain region or resulted in predicted protein
products lacking the entire helicase region. Their results confirmed
that mutations in the WRN gene are responsible for Werner syndrome. In
addition, the location of the mutations indicated that the presence or
absence of the helicase domain does not influence the Werner syndrome
phenotype, suggesting that this syndrome is the result of complete loss
of function of the WRN gene product.

Moser et al. (1999) reviewed the spectrum of WRN mutations in Werner
syndrome, the organization and potential functions of the WRN protein,
and the possible mechanisms linking the loss of WRN function with the
clinical and cellular phenotypes of Werner syndrome.

Monnat (1999) cited results from his own laboratory and from that of the
AGENE Research Institute indicating that 80% of the WRN mutations in
Japanese Werner syndrome patients led to a lack of detectable mutant
protein. Thus many and perhaps all Werner syndrome-associated WRN
mutations are likely to be functionally equivalent null alleles. These
results contradict the suggestion of Ishikawa et al. (1999) that a
different spectrum of mutations in the WRN gene in Japanese may confer a
higher risk of thyroid carcinoma of the papillary or follicular type.
However, the consistent absence of WRN protein in the cells of patients
with Werner syndrome could both favor and partially explain the
development of thyroid carcinoma with follicular and anaplastic, as
opposed to the more papillary, histology.

Using cDNA microanalysis, Kyng et al. (2003) found that fibroblasts from
4 patients with Werner syndrome and fibroblasts from 5 older control
individuals (average age 90 years) showed transcription alteration of
435 (6.3%) of 6,192 genes examined compared to cells from young adult
controls. Of the 435 genes, 91% of the 249 genes with known function had
similar transcription changes in both Werner syndrome patients and
normal old age controls. The major functional categories of the
similarly transcribed genes of known function included DNA/RNA
metabolism, cell growth, and stress response. Kyng et al. (2003)
concluded that Werner syndrome may be a good model for normal aging and
that both processes are linked to altered transcription.

HISTORY

Thomas et al. (1993) excluded the FGFR1 gene (136350) as the site of the
mutation in Werner syndrome.

In blood samples from Werner syndrome patients, Sadakane et al. (1994)
identified large insertions or deletions in the DNA polymerase beta gene
(POLB; 174760), which maps to 8p12-p11. A 107-bp insertion was found in
2 independent Werner syndrome patients and in the carrier mother of 1 of
the patients, but not in an unaffected sister or in a healthy
population. The authors suggested that mutations in the POLB gene may
underlie the disorder. However, Chang et al. (1994) presented several
lines of evidence suggesting that POLB is not the Werner syndrome gene.
Activity gels showed normal enzyme activity and electrophoretic
mobility. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the entire coding region
failed to demonstrate mutations, although mistakes in the published
sequence for POLB were discovered. Single-strand conformation
polymorphism (SSCP) and heteroduplex analyses failed to reveal evidence
of mutations in the promoter region. A newly discerned polymorphism
failed to reveal homozygosity by descent in a consanguineous patient.
Fluorescence in situ hybridization placed the POLB gene centromeric to
D8S135 at 8p11.2, beyond the region of peak lod scores for Werner
syndrome.

ANIMAL MODEL

Lombard et al. (2000) generated mice bearing a mutation that eliminated
expression of the C terminus of the helicase domain of the WRN protein.
Mutant mice were born at the expected mendelian frequency and did not
show any overt histologic signs of accelerated senescence. The mice were
capable of living beyond 2 years of age. Cells from these animals did
not show elevated susceptibility to 2 genotoxins. However, mutant
fibroblasts aged approximately 1 passage earlier than controls.
Importantly, mice that were doubly homozygous for WRN and p53 (191170)
deficiencies showed an increased mortality rate relative to animals that
were heterozygous for WRN deficiency and homozygous for p53 null.
Lombard et al. (2000) considered possible models for the synergy between
p53 and WRN mutations for the determination of life span.

609449	TITLE *609449 NUDE, A. NIDULANS, HOMOLOG OF, 1; NDE1
;;NUDE;;
HOM-TES-87
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using Lis1 (PAFAH1B1; 601545) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a
rat liver cDNA library, Kitagawa et al. (2000) cloned rat Nude. The
deduced 344-amino acid protein contains an asp- and glu-rich N-terminal
half and a ser- and thr-rich C-terminal half. Rat Nude shares
significant homology with a fungal nuclear distribution protein, NudE,
and a Xenopus mitotic phosphoprotein, Mpp43. Northern blot analysis
detected a 2.4-kb Nude transcript in all rat tissues examined.

By subtractive hybridization to isolate testis-specific transcripts,
followed by serologic expression screening with antibodies from a
seminoma patient, Tureci et al. (2002) isolated NDE1, which they
designated HOM-TES-87. Northern blot analysis detected high expression
in testis, and RT-PCR detected NDE1 in other tissues.

By PCR of a placenta cDNA library, Yan et al. (2003) cloned human NUDE.
Western blot analysis detected NUDE at an apparent molecular mass of
about 40 kD in several human cell lines. Western blot analysis of mouse
tissues detected highest expression in brain, with much lower expression
in heart, skeletal muscle, and lung, and little to no expression in
other tissues examined.

Bakircioglu et al. (2011) found NDE1 expression in the apical
neuroepithelium throughout the developing human and mouse brain. NDE1
was strongly expressed in apical precursors in the ventricular zone and
in the newborn neuronal population of the human embryonic brain, but had
reduced expression in the subventricular zone. In the mouse brain, Nde1
localized to the centrosomes of all cells. In apical neuroepithelial
cells, expression of centrosomal Nde1 was greatest during interphase and
early mitosis and reduced during metaphase. In cultured cells, Nde1
colocalized with gamma-tubulin (TUBG1; 191135) at the centrosome and was
present in the cytoplasm, at the centrosome, and on the mitotic spindle.

GENE STRUCTURE

The NDE1 gene contains 9 exons, the last of which is entirely contained
in the neighboring MYH11 gene (160745) (Bakircioglu et al., 2011).

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the NDE1
gene to chromosome 16 (TMAP SHGC-60785). Bakircioglu et al. (2011) noted
that the NDE1 gene maps to chromosome 16p13.

GENE FUNCTION

Kitagawa et al. (2000) found that rat Nude and the catalytic subunits of
Pafah (see PAFAH1B2; 602508) interacted with Pafah1b1 in a competitive
manner. They suggested that PAFAH1B1 functions in nuclear migration by
interacting with multiple intracellular proteins, including NUDE.

Yan et al. (2003) found that NUDE was phosphorylated in M phase of the
cell cycle in human cells. A fraction of NUDE bound strongly to
centrosomes in interphase and localized to mitotic spindles in early M
phase. ATP inhibitor assays indicated that NUDE bound cytoplasmic dynein
(see 600112) and migrated with it to spindle poles along microtubules.

Burdick et al. (2008) noted that NDE1 is a homolog of NDEL1 (607538) and
also binds to DISC1 (605210). NDE1 was expressed at constant levels in
the rat cerebral cortex from embryonic day (E) 14 to adulthood, whereas
NDEL1 expression showed a time-course increase peaking at postnatal day
7. Further studies with a ser704-to-cys (S704C) polymorphism in the
DISC1 gene showed that NDE1 bound stronger to ser704, while NDEL1 bound
stronger to cys704. The findings suggested an interaction of these 3
proteins, with possible competitive binding between NDEL1 and NDE1 for
DISC1.

Alkuraya et al. (2011) demonstrated the NDE1 is phosphorylated by CDK1
(116940) and that phosphorylation of NDE1 at thr246 in the C-terminal
domain is required for cells to progress through the G2/M phase of
mitosis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By linkage analysis followed by candidate gene sequencing, Bakircioglu
et al. (2011) identified 2 different homozygous truncating mutations in
the NDE1 gene (609449.0001 and 609449.0002, respectively) in affected
members of 3 consanguineous families with lissencephaly-4 (LIS4; 614019)
with extreme microcephaly. The disorder showed dual pathogenesis of
profound early prenatal failure of neuron production and later prenatal
deficiency of cortical lamination.

Alkuraya et al. (2011) independently identified 2 homozygous truncating
mutations in the NDE1 gene (609449.0001 and 609449.0003, respectively)
in affected members from 2 consanguineous Saudi Arabian families with
LIS4. Patient-derived lymphoblast cells showed spindle-structure
defects, including tripolar spindles, misaligned mitotic chromosomes,
nuclear fragmentation, and abnormal microtubule organizations,
supporting an essential role for NDE1 in normal mitotic spindle
function, neuronal proliferation, and human cerebral cortical
neurogenesis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Feng and Walsh (2004) found that Nde1-null mice were viable, but they
showed a small-brain phenotype. At 6 to 8 weeks of age, the brains of
Nde1-null mice were one-third smaller than their wildtype or
heterozygous counterparts. The size reduction predominantly affected the
cerebral cortex, while other brain structures, including the
hippocampus, midbrain, and cerebellum, appeared normal or were only
slightly reduced in size. Cortical lamination was mostly preserved, but
the mutant cortex had fewer neurons and thin superficial cortical layers
II to IV. Bromodeoxyuridine birthdating revealed retarded and modestly
disorganized neuronal migration. More dramatic defects were found in
mitotic progression, mitotic orientation, and chromosome localization in
cortical progenitors. The small cerebral cortex of Nde1-null mice
appeared to reflect both reduced progenitor cell division and altered
neuronal cell fates. In vitro analysis demonstrated that Nde1 was
essential for centrosome duplication and mitotic spindle assembly. Feng
and Walsh (2004) concluded that mitotic spindle function and orientation
are essential for normal cortical development.

Interaction between Nde1 and Lis1 is critical in the development of the
mouse central nervous system (CNS). Pawlisz et al. (2008) analyzed a
series of Nde1 and Lis1 double mutations in mice and showed that the
Nde1-Lis1 complex was specifically required by the radial
glial/neuroepithelial progenitor cells during CNS development. Besides
mitotic spindle regulation, Lis1 and Nde1 maintained the morphology and
lateral cell-cell contacts of progenitors in the cortical ventricular
zone. This cell shape and organization control appeared necessary for
symmetrical cell division and the self-renewal of neural progenitors
during the early phase of corticogenesis. Loss of Lis1-Nde1 function led
to dramatically increased neuronal differentiation at the onset of
cortical neurogenesis, resulting in overproduction of the earliest-born
preplate and Cajal-Retzius neurons, with consequent loss of the laminar
pattern and over 80% mass and surface area of the cerebral cortex.

Alkuraya et al. (2011) found that mouse embryonic fibroblasts with Nde1
mutations showed defects in mitotic progression, as evidenced by an
increased mitotic index; abnormal spindle structures such as multipolar
spindles; and chromosome misalignment.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
LISSENCEPHALY 4
NDE1, 2-BP DEL, 684AC

In affected members of 2 unrelated consanguineous Pakistani families
with lissencephaly-4 (614019) with extreme microcephaly, Bakircioglu et
al. (2011) identified a homozygous 2-bp deletion (684delAC) in exon 6 of
the NDE1 gene, resulting in a frameshift, loss of amino acids 229 to
335, addition of 84 novel amino acids, and ultimately termination at
position 314. The mutant protein was predicted to lack the highly
conserved C-terminal domain, which is critical for localization to the
centrosome. In vitro functional expression studies showed that the
mutant protein failed to localize properly to the centrosome. Haplotype
analysis indicated a founder effect.

Alkuraya et al. (2011) identified a homozygous 684delAC mutation in 2
sisters, born of consanguineous Saudi Arabian parents, with LIS4.
Immunoblot analysis of patient lymphocytes showed no detectable NDE1
expression, suggesting that the mutant protein was unstable and subject
to degradation. In vitro functional expression studies showed that the
mutant protein could not bind dynein (see 600112), although LIS1
(601545) binding was normal.

.0002
LISSENCEPHALY 4
NDE1, IVS2DS, G-T, +1

In affected members of a consanguineous Turkish family with
lissencephaly-4 (LIS4; 614019), Bakircioglu et al. (2011) identified a
homozygous G-to-T transversion (83+1G-T) in the second exon donor site
of the NDE1 gene. The mutation was shown to result in a frameshift
beginning in exon 3, addition of 113 novel amino acids, and a premature
stop codon at position 114. The resultant protein would lack the highly
conserved C-terminal domain as well as the homodimerization domain.
Immunoblot analysis showed significantly reduced NDE1 protein in patient
cells compared to controls. In vitro functional expression studies
showed that the mutant protein failed to colocalize properly with
gamma-tubulin (TUBG1; 191135) and failed to localize to the centromere.

.0003
LISSENCEPHALY 4
NDE1, 1-BP DUP, 733C

In affected members of a consanguineous Saudi Arabian family with
lissencephaly-4 (LIS4; 614019), Alkuraya et al. (2011) identified a
homozygous 1-bp duplication (733dupC) in exon 7 of the NDE1 gene,
predicted to result in a truncated protein after the addition of 69
novel amino acids. The mutant protein lacked the conserved C-terminal
domain critical for centromere localization. In vitro functional
expression studies showed that the mutant protein could not bind dynein
(see 600112), although LIS1 (601545) binding was normal. In addition,
the mutant protein did not localize properly to the centrosome.

600848	TITLE *600848 NUCLEAR RECEPTOR COREPRESSOR 2; NCOR2
;;SILENCING MEDIATOR FOR RETINOID AND THYROID HORMONE RECEPTORS; SMRT
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NCOR2 is a transcriptional corepressor that maintains the 'off state' of
nonliganded nuclear receptors. Its interaction with nuclear receptors is
mediated by 2 C-terminal receptor-interacting domains (RIDs). NCOR2
facilitates transcriptional repression by serving as a scaffold protein
to recruit histone deacetylase complexes and chromatin-remodeling
factors (summary by Pei et al., 2011).

CLONING

Transcriptional silencing mediated by nuclear receptors is important in
development, differentiation, and oncogenesis. Chen and Evans (1995)
identified a receptor-interacting factor, NCOR2, which they designated
SMRT, as a silencing mediator (corepressor) for retinoid receptors (see
180240) and thyroid hormone receptors (see 190120). They cloned SMRT
from a HeLa cell cDNA library. The deduced 1,495-amino acid protein has
a calculated molecular mass of 168 kD. It has a proline-rich N-terminal
domain, followed by ERDR and SG regions and a C-terminal domain that
shares significant similarity with mouse Rip13 (NCOR1; 600849). Chen and
Evans (1995) also identified a splice variant of SMRT that encodes a
protein lacking a 46-amino acid sequence in the C-terminal domain.
Northern blot analysis detected ubiquitous SMRT expression.
Immunofluorescence analysis indicated that SMRT is a nuclear protein.
Horlein et al. (1995) proposed that SMRT and NCOR (NCOR1; 600849) belong
to a family of corepressors that they termed TRACs (thyroid hormone- and
retinoic acid receptor-associated corepressors).

Using mouse Smrt and successive 5-prime proximal probes, Ordentlich et
al. (1999) cloned full-length human SMRT from a pituitary cDNA library.
The deduced protein contains 2,517 amino acid. The N terminus contains 2
repression domains separated by a SANT domain and is highly homologous
to the N terminus of NCOR1. Northern blot analysis detected a SMRT
transcript of about 10 kb in all mouse tissues examined, with highest
expression in brain, lung, and spleen. A minor transcript of 8.5 kb was
also detected in most tissues. Ordentlich et al. (1999) also cloned a
splice variant of Smrt from mouse brain that encodes a protein lacking
amino acids 36 through 254 of full-length Ncor2.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Binding of ligand to nuclear hormone receptors induces a conformation
that attracts coactivator proteins containing a leu-x-x-leu-leu motif,
the so-called NR box. Hu and Lazar (1999) showed that NCOR1 and SMRT
contain sequences that are similar to the NR box and are repeated in
each of 2 nuclear hormone receptor interaction domains. Hu and Lazar
(1999) called this box (L/I-x-x-I/V-I) the CoRNR (corepressor/nuclear
receptor; 'corner') box. The corner box is required for nuclear hormone
receptor interaction, and corner box peptides specifically block
corepressor interaction in vitro and repression in vivo. Sequences
flanking the corner box determine nuclear hormone receptor specificity.
Thus, Hu and Lazar (1999) concluded that the key feature of hormone
action, differential recognition of unliganded and liganded nuclear
hormone receptors by coactivators and corepressors, is due to very
subtle differences between CoRNR and NR boxes.

- Crystal Structure

Watson et al. (2012) reported the structure of a complex between an HDAC
(HDAC3; 605166) and a corepressor, NCOR2. The structure revealed 2
remarkable features. First, the SMRT-deacetylase activation domain (DAD)
undergoes a large structural rearrangement on forming the complex.
Second, there is an essential inositol tetraphosphate molecule,
D-myo-inositol-(1,4,5,6)-tetrakisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5,6)P4), acting as
an 'intermolecular glue' between the 2 proteins. Assembly of the complex
is clearly dependent on the Ins(1,4,5,6)P4, which may act as a
regulator, potentially explaining why inositol phosphates and their
kinases have been found to act as transcriptional regulators. This
mechanism for the activation of HDAC3 appears to be conserved in class I
HDACs from yeast to humans, and the authors suggested it opens the way
to novel therapeutic opportunities.

GENE FUNCTION

Chen and Evans (1995) found that association of SMRT with receptors,
both in solution and bound to DNA response elements, was destabilized by
ligand. The interaction with mutant receptors correlated with their
transcriptional silencing activities. The repressor function of thyroid
hormone receptor and retinoic acid receptor appeared to involve direct
interaction with SMRT, possibly in a way that stabilized or promoted
their interaction with the transcription factor TFIIB (189963). Chen and
Evans (1995) showed that ligand caused dissociation of SMRT from the
receptor, triggering the activation process.

Fischle et al. (2002) showed that the catalytic domain of HDAC4 (605314)
interacts with HDAC3 (605166) via the transcriptional corepressor NCOR2.
All experimental conditions leading to the suppression of HDAC4 binding
to NCOR2 and to HDAC3 resulted in loss of enzymatic activity associated
with HDAC4. These observations indicated that class II HDACs regulate
transcription by bridging the enzymatically active NCOR2-HDAC3 complex
and select transcription factors.

Hoberg et al. (2004) presented evidence that IKK-alpha (CHUK; 600664)
phosphorylates chromatin-bound SMRT, stimulating its removal from
chromatin and allowing recruitment of NFKB (see 164011) to promoters and
transcription of NFKB-dependent genes.

Jepsen et al. (2007) reported a critical role for SMRT in forebrain
development and in maintenance of the neural stem cell state. Analysis
of a series of markers in SMRT gene-deleted mice revealed the functional
requirement of SMRT in the actions of both retinoic acid-dependent and
Notch (see 190198)-dependent forebrain development. In isolated cortical
progenitor cells, SMRT was critical for preventing retinoic acid
receptor (see 180220)-dependent induction of differentiation along a
neuronal pathway in the absence of any ligand. Jepsen et al. (2007)
demonstrated that SMRT represses expression of the jumonji
domain-containing gene JMJD3 (611577), a direct retinoic acid receptor
target that functions as a histone H3 trimethyl K27 demethylase and
which is capable of activating specific components of the neurogenic
program.

GENE STRUCTURE

Jiang et al. (2001) determined that the NCOR2 gene contains 45 exons.

MAPPING

By FISH, Ordentlich et al. (1999) mapped the NCOR2 gene to chromosome
12q24.

ANIMAL MODEL

Pei et al. (2011) generated knockin mice expressing point mutations in
both RIDs of Smrt, which disrupted its interaction with nuclear
receptors. On a pure C57BL/6J background, these mice, which Pei et al.
(2011) called Smrt(mRID) mice, died shortly after birth from acute
respiratory distress syndrome due to abnormal terminal differentiation
of type I pneumocytes. Maternal delivery of antithyroid drugs, but not
antagonists of other nuclear receptors, rescued lethality in Smrt(mRID)
pups. Mice treated with antithyroid drugs during the time of terminal
lung differentiation were born alive, showed no evidence of respiratory
distress, and survived to adulthood. Microarray analysis revealed that
Klf2 (602016) expression was downregulated in Smrt(mRID) mice. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation analysis of MLE-12 mouse lung carcinoma cells showed
that both Smrt and thyroid hormone receptor bound a conserved enhancer
region downstream of the mouse Klf2 gene. Overexpression of Klf2 in
MLE-12 cells upregulated expression of type I pneumocyte markers, and
targeted disruption of Klf2 in mouse lung recapitulated the phenotype of
Smrt(mRID) mice. Pei et al. (2011) concluded that regulation of KLF2
expression by SMRT is required for terminal lung development.

;;GTPase-ACTIVATING PROTEIN, RHO, 1;;
RHOGAP1;;
RHOGAP;;
CDC42GAP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The Rho family of GTP-binding proteins modulates cytoskeletal changes.
Garrett et al. (1991) purified a 29-kD cytoplasmic GTPase-activating
protein (GAP), called RHOGAP by them, from human spleen extracts. RHOGAP
stimulated the GTPase activity of p21-Rho but not other small molecular
mass GTP-binding proteins. Diekmann et al. (1991) reported a partial
amino acid sequence of RHOGAP. Using PCR with primers based on the
RHOGAP protein sequence, Lancaster et al. (1994) isolated a human
fibrosarcoma cell line cDNA encoding RHOGAP. Northern blot analysis
revealed that RHOGAP is expressed as a 3.6-kb mRNA. The RHOGAP cDNA
encodes a predicted 439-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular
mass of 50 kD. Since antibodies against RHOGAP detected a 50-kD protein
on Western blots of cell extracts, Lancaster et al. (1994) suggested
that the previously observed 29-kD protein was a C-terminal proteolytic
fragment of RHOGAP that was generated during protein purification.

Barfod et al. (1993) cloned human platelet-precursor cell cDNAs encoding
CDC42GAP, a protein that inactivates CDC42 by stimulating GTP
hydrolysis. They found that CDC42GAP contains a functional SH3-binding
domain.

GENE FUNCTION

Lancaster et al. (1994) found that the Rho family members Rho, RAC, and
CDC42 (116952) were substrates for RHOGAP, with CDC42 the preferred
substrate.

Shen et al. (2008) showed that Nudel (NDEL1; 607538) colocalized with
Cdc42gap at the leading edge of migrating NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts. This
localization of Nudel required its phosphorylation by Erk1 (MAPK3;
601795)/Erk2 (MAPK1; 176948). Shen et al. (2008) found that Nudel
competed with Cdc42 for binding Cdc42gap. Consequently, Nudel inhibited
Cdc42gap-mediated inactivation of Cdc42 in a dose-dependent manner.
Depletion of Nudel by RNA interference or overexpression of a
nonphosphorylatable Nudel mutant abolished Cdc42 activation and cell
migration. Shen et al. (2008) concluded that NUDEL facilitates cell
migration by sequestering CDC42GAP at the leading edge to stabilize
active CDC42 in response to extracellular stimuli.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the RHOGAP1
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP RH79109).

;;CHROMATIN-MODIFYING PROTEIN 1B;;
CHARGED MULTIVESICULAR BODY PROTEIN 1B;;
CHROMOSOME 18 OPEN READING FRAME 2; C18ORF2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CHMP1B belongs to the chromatin-modifying protein/charged multivesicular
body protein (CHMP) family. These proteins are components of ESCRT-III
(endosomal sorting complex required for transport III), a complex
involved in degradation of surface receptor proteins and formation of
endocytic multivesicular bodies (MVBs). Some CHMPs have both nuclear and
cytoplasmic/vesicular distributions, and one such CHMP, CHMP1A (164010),
is required for both MVB formation and regulation of cell cycle
progression (Tsang et al., 2006).

CLONING

By in silico gene trapping, Vuoristo et al. (2001) identified a novel
gene, designated C18ORF2, embedded in exon 5 of the GNAL gene (139312)
on chromosome 18p11. The C18ORF2 gene encodes a deduced 199-amino acid
protein with a predicted molecular mass of 22.1 kD. The protein is
highly conserved across several species and shares 55% sequence identity
with the PRSM1 gene (CHMP1A). RT-PCR analysis detected moderate
expression of C18ORF2 in all tissues tested.

GENE FUNCTION

Scott et al. (2005) found that the C-terminal half of the endosomal
sorting complex protein CHMP1B bound the microtubule-interacting and
transport (MIT) domain of VPS4A (609982).

Using a yeast 2-hybrid approach, Reid et al. (2005) identified CHMP1B as
a binding partner of spastin (SPAST; 604277), mutations in which are the
most common cause of hereditary spastic paraplegia, which results in
degeneration of long axons. CHMP1B and spastin proteins showed clear
cytoplasmic colocalization in transfected cells; CHMP1B and spastin
proteins interacted specifically in vitro and in vivo in complementation
assays, and spastin coimmunoprecipitated with CHMP1B. The interaction
was mediated by a region of spastin lying between residues 80 and 196
and containing an MIT domain. Expression of epitope-tagged CHMP1B in
mammalian cells prevented the development of the abnormal microtubule
phenotype associated with expression of ATPase-defective spastin. The
authors suggested a role for spastin in intracellular membrane traffic
events, and proposed that defects in intracellular membrane traffic may
be a significant cause of motor neuron pathology.

Tsang et al. (2006) performed a systematic yeast 2-hybrid analysis of
human ESCRT-III components, including CHMP1B. The novel CHMP1B-binding
partners included SSRP1 (604328), which may be involved in chromatin
remodeling, TRAF4AF1, which may be involved in signal transduction, and
AMSH (606247). Coimmunoprecipitation assays confirmed the interaction
between CHMP1B and AMSH, and the 2 proteins partially colocalized with
M6PR (154540) on late endosomal membranes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Vuoristo et al. (2001) determined that the C18ORF2 gene is intronless.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Vuoristo et al. (2001) identified the
C18ORF2 gene within intron 5 of the GNAL gene (139312) on chromosome
18p11.

;;ZINEDIN; ZIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching EST databases for sequences similar to striatin (STRN;
614765) and SG2NA (STRN3; 614766), followed by RT-PCR of NT2 human
teratocarcinoma cells, Castets et al. (2000) cloned STRN4, which they
called zinedin. The deduced 753-amino acid protein has a structure
identical to that of striatin and SG2NA, including a putative N-terminal
caveolin (see CAV1, 601047)-binding domain, followed by a coiled-coil
region, a putative calmodulin (see 114180)-binding domain, and 8
WD-repeats spread over the C-terminal half. Northern blot analysis of
mouse tissues detected a 4-kb zinedin transcript in brain and
cerebellum, with little to no expression in all other tissues examined.
Western blot analysis detected mouse zinedin at an apparent molecular
mass of 100 kD predominantly in brain, cerebellum, and lung. In rat
brain homogenates, about half of all striatin, Sg2na, and zinedin were
membrane-bound and released by detergents.

GENE STRUCTURE

Castets et al. (2000) determined that the STRN4 gene contains 18 coding
exons.

MAPPING

By FISH, Castets et al. (2000) mapped the STRN4 gene to chromosome
19q13.2.

GENE FUNCTION

Castets et al. (2000) found that cytosolic rat brain striatin, zinedin,
and all 3 isoforms of Sg2na bound immobilized calmodulin in the presence
of calcium and were eluted with EDTA.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching a sequence database using IMAP1 (608084) as probe, Stamm et
al. (2002) identified IMAP2. The deduced 337-amino acid protein contains
5 motifs conserved in GTP-binding proteins and a putative C-terminal
transmembrane region. IMAP2 shares 43% amino acid identity with IMAP1
(608084).

GENE STRUCTURE

Stamm et al. (2002) determined that the IMAP1 gene contains 3 exons.
Exon 1 is untranslated, and exon 3 contains more than 94% of the coding
sequence.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Stamm et al. (2002) mapped the IMAP2 gene
to a 100-kb IMAP gene cluster on chromosome 7q32-q36. Within this
cluster, IMAP1 is located on the negative strand, while IMAP2, IMAP3
(IAN4L1; 608086), and IMAP4 (608087) are on the opposite positive
strand.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Wigge and Kilmartin (2001) purified a protein complex from S. cerevisiae
that contained various components of the centromere, including Ndc80
(607272) and Nuf2. By database analysis, they identified human NUF2.
Immunofluorescence studies showed that both NUF2 and NDC80 localized at
the centromeres of mitotic HeLa cells.

Nabetani et al. (2001) cloned human NUF2, which encodes a deduced
464-amino acid coiled-coil protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Nabetani et al. (2001) found that disruption of the Nuf2 gene in S.
pombe resulted in defects in chromosome segregation and the spindle
checkpoint. In particular, the spindles became elongated but without
chromosome segregation. Nabetani et al. (2001) suggested that NUF2
establishes a connection between the spindle and the centromere.

DeLuca et al. (2002) showed that NUF2 specifically functions at
kinetochores and acts to stabilize microtubule attachment in HeLa cells.
Using RNA interference to block NUF2 translation, they found that
spindle formation occurred normally but that kinetochores did not form
attachments to active spindle checkpoints. Depletion of NUF2 also
induced mitotic cells to undergo cell death. DeLuca et al. (2002)
proposed that NUF2 is part of a linker between the kinetochore and
tubulin subunits of the spindle.

Liu et al. (2007) demonstrated that NUF2 binds to the C-terminal domain
of CENPE (117143) and is required for stabilizing CENPE in the
kinetochore. When siRNA blocked NUF2 synthesis, CENPE was no longer
detected in the kinetochore and aberrant chromosome segregation
occurred. Liu et al. (2007) concluded that both proteins are essential
for stable kinetochores and proper chromosome segregation during
mitosis.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nabetani et al. (2001) mapped the NUF2
gene to chromosome 1q23.

;;PROTEASE INHIBITOR 6; PI6;;
PLACENTAL THROMBIN INHIBITOR; PTI;;
SPI3, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; SPI3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Coughlin et al. (1993) described a cDNA encoding a serine proteinase
inhibitor present in placental tissue and in the cytosolic fraction of
the leukemic cell line K562. On the basis of its interaction with
thrombin, through which it was discovered, the inhibitor was
operationally named the placental thrombin inhibitor (PTI). Amino acid
sequence comparisons suggested that its reactive center is located at
arg341 and cys342, that it lacks a classic N-terminal signal sequence,
and that it has the highest degree of similarity to intracellular serine
proteinase inhibitors (serpins), such as the human monocyte/neutrophil
elastase inhibitor (ELANH2; 130135). Analysis of human tissue mRNA
indicated that PTI is expressed widely, with the highest levels in
cardiac and skeletal muscle and placenta. Coughlin et al. (1993)
concluded that PTI is a member of an emerging class of intracellular
serpins.

Sun et al. (1995) showed that expression of the mouse PI6 homolog, Spi3,
is developmentally regulated, and that, unlike the situation in the
human, Spi3 is absent from the mouse placenta.

Nishibori et al. (1995) isolated a serum protease, designated B43, from
bovine brain. They used histochemical staining to demonstrate its
presence in fibrous astroglial cells, particularly in endfeet-like
cellular structures, suggesting its involvement in the blood-brain
barrier. Partial amino acid sequence of the protease suggested that it
was the homolog of human PI6 and mouse Spi3.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sun et al. (1995) determined that the mouse Spi3 gene spans 20 kb,
contains 7 exons and 6 introns, and contains a TATA motif 24 bp upstream
of the transcriptional start site.

MAPPING

Coughlin et al. (1995) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to map
the SERPINB6 gene to chromosome 6p25.

While studying a cluster of serine proteinase inhibitors of the
ovalbumin family, including maspin (SERPINB6; 154790) located on
chromosome 18q21.3, Schneider et al. (1995) prepared PCR primer sets for
the 3-prime untranslated region of PTI. Using the NIGMS monochromosomal
somatic cell hybrid panel, they mapped the PTI gene to chromosome 6.
Evans et al. (1995) confirmed the assignment to chromosome 6 and
regionalized it to 6pter-p24 by demonstrating that PI6 colocalizes with
another Ov-serpin gene, ELANH2 (130135). The localization was achieved
with a chromosome 6 regional hybrid DNA panel.

Sun et al. (1995) mapped the mouse Spi3 gene to chromosome 13 between
the Pl1 and ctla2a genes.

GENE FUNCTION

Sirmaci et al. (2010) found that Serpinb6 was expressed in crista hair
cells of the mouse inner ear at embryonic day (E) 16.5. Hair cell
expression was sustained in adult mice. Serpinb6 was expressed in the
cytoplasm of both cochlear and utricular hair cells in the embryo and
early postnatal age, and in the greater epithelial ridge region in early
postnatal age.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By genomewide linkage analysis followed by candidate gene sequencing in
affected members of a consanguineous Turkish family with nonsyndromic
progressive hearing loss (DFNB91; 613453), Sirmaci et al. (2010)
identified a homozygous truncating mutation in the SERPINB6 gene (E245X;
173321.0001), resulting in loss of function. Sirmaci et al. (2010)
concluded that SERPINB6 plays an important role in the inner ear in the
protection against leakage of lysosomal content during stress, and that
loss of this protection results in cell death and sensorineural hearing
loss.

ANIMAL MODEL

Scarff et al. (2004) found that Spi3-deficient mice developed normally,
were fertile, and had no obvious pathology. Increased levels of Elanh2
in the tissues of mutant mice suggested that compensation by other
serpins reduced the impact of Spi3 deficiency.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
DEAFNESS, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 91
SERPINB6, GLU245TER

In affected members of a consanguineous Turkish family with nonsyndromic
progressive hearing loss (DFNB91; 613453), Sirmaci et al. (2010)
identified a homozygous 744G-T transversion in the SERPINB6 gene,
resulting in a gly245-to-ter (E245X) substitution, which removes 131
amino acids in the C-terminal region that includes the reactive center
loop. Further studies showed that the mutation resulted in mRNA decay
and complete lack of protein expression. The mutation was not found in
300 Turkish controls or in an additional 542 Turkish, Greek, American,
and Palestinian families, mostly with congenital hearing loss. In vitro
functional expression studies in HeLa cells showed that the E245X
mutation resulted in increased loss of lysosomal integrity in response
to osmotic shock compared to cells transfected with wildtype SERPINB6.
These findings suggested that wildtype SERPINB6 is required to counter
potentially cytotoxic components of leaking lysosomal proteases that
result from various stress conditions. Although the precise age of onset
could not be ascertained, the youngest affected individual, who was 23
years old, reported loss of hearing after age 20. The hearing loss was
progressive and age-dependent, consistent with a loss of function of an
intracellular protease inhibitor.

608076	TITLE *608076 TYROSINE KINASE, NONRECEPTOR, 1; TNK1
;;CD38-NEGATIVE KINASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TNK1 is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase. These kinases, like members of
the SRC (190090) and JAK (see 147795) families, mediate intracellular
signaling downstream of receptor activation.

CLONING

Using degenerate primers based on conserved tyrosine kinase motifs,
Hoehn et al. (1996) cloned TNK1 by PCR of cDNA from CD38
(107270)-negative umbilical cord blood cells enriched for early
progenitors. They obtained the full-length TNK1 cDNA by 5-prime and
3-prime RACE of an erythroleukemia cell line cDNA library. The deduced
666-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of about 72 kD.
TNK1 contains a putative N-terminal phosphotyrosine-binding domain,
followed by the tyrosine kinase domain, a putative SH3 domain, and a
proline-rich C terminus that contains SH3-binding motifs. The kinase
domain has all 12 structural features conserved in tyrosine kinases,
including an ATP-binding site. TNK1 shares highest homology with ACK
(606994), including 45% amino acid identity over a 413-amino acid span
that includes the kinase domain and putative SH3 domain. Northern blot
analysis detected a 3.0-kb transcript in prostate, testis, ovary, small
intestine, and colon. Northern blot analysis of fetal tissues detected
tissue-specific expression of 4 transcripts between 1.0 and 9.5 kb in
fetal brain, lung, liver, and kidney. RT-PCR detected TNK1 expression in
all bone marrow, cord blood, and peripheral blood cells examined, and in
16 of 20 leukemia cell lines.

MAPPING

By PCR of rodent/human cell lines and FISH, Hoehn et al. (1996) mapped
the TNK1 gene to chromosome 17p13.1.
