;;CAS LIGAND WITH MULTIPLE SH3 DOMAINS; CMS
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

P130(Cas) (602941) is a docking protein that is tyrosine-phosphorylated
in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli, such as growth
factors, cell-cell interaction, and cell-matrix interaction, and appears
to play a critical role in the integrin-linked formation of focal
complexes. To understand the growth regulatory pathway of p130(Cas),
Kirsch et al. (1999) used the yeast 2-hybrid system to search for
interacting molecules. They identified a human protein, which they
called CMS for p130(Cas) ligand with multiple SH3 domains, as a direct
binding protein of p130(Cas). CMS is a multifunctional adapter-type
molecule, which is localized in the cytoplasm, membrane ruffles, and
leading edges of cells. Its structure and colocalization with F-actin
(see 102610) and p130(Cas) suggested a function as a scaffolding protein
involved in the dynamic regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. The cDNA
corresponding to CMS encodes a protein of 639 amino acids with a deduced
molecular mass of approximately 70 kD. Amino acid analysis revealed that
CMS contains in its N terminus 3 SH3 domains followed by a proline-rich
region containing binding sites for SH3 domains. Putative actin-binding
sites and a coiled-coil domain are located at the C terminus of the
protein, which also contains a putative leucine zipper motif. CMS mRNA
is ubiquitously expressed in adult and fetal human tissues as an
approximately 5.4-kb transcript, as detected by Northern blot analysis.

Dustin et al. (1998) cloned the mouse homolog of CMS, which they called
CD2AP, that binds the cytoplasmic tail of the adhesion molecule CD2
(186990). Kirsch et al. (1999) stated that the mouse CD2AP protein is
86% identical to human CMS.

GENE FUNCTION

Kirsch et al. (1999) demonstrated that CMS induces vesicle formation and
colocalizes with p130(Cas) and F-actin to membrane ruffles. It also
associates with and is phosphorylated by tyrosine kinases. CMS is able
to homodimerize through the coiled-coil domain located in its C
terminus. There was no evidence for intermolecular or intramolecular
binding via the SH3 domains and PXXP binding.

Dustin et al. (1998) demonstrated that ligand engagement of the adhesion
molecule CD2 initiates the process of protein segregation, CD2
clustering, and cytoskeletal polarization. Although protein segregation
was not dependent on the cytoplasmic domain of CD2, CD2 clustering and
cytoskeletal polarization required an interaction with the CD2
cytoplasmic domain with a novel SH3-containing protein.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Kim et al. (2003) found the same mutation (604241.0001) in the CD2AP
gene in 2 African Americans with primary focal segmental
glomerulosclerosis (FSGS3; 607832). The mutation affects the splice
acceptor of exon 7 on one allele, replacing 2 nucleotides, GC, with CT.
No stable truncated protein was produced from the alternatively spliced
transcript. Kim et al. (2003) suggested that haploinsufficiency for
CD2AP is a determinant of human susceptibility to glomerular disease.

In a boy with severe early-onset nephrotic syndrome associated with
focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, Lowik et al. (2007) identified a
homozygous mutation in the CD2AP gene (R612X; 604241.0002). There was no
expression of the mutant protein in patient lymphocytes, consistent with
a complete loss of function. Each unaffected parent was heterozygous for
the mutation, indicating that heterozygosity for this mutation does not
result in renal disease.

ANIMAL MODEL

Shih et al. (1999) generated mice lacking CD2AP by targeted disruption.
In Cd2ap-deficient mice, immune function was compromised, but the mice
died from renal failure at 6 to 7 weeks of age. In the kidney, Cd2ap was
expressed primarily in glomerular epithelial cells. Knockout mice
exhibited defects in epithelial cell foot processes, accompanied by
mesangial cell hyperplasia and extracellular matrix deposition. CD2AP
associated with nephrin (602716), which is the primary component of the
slit diaphragm. This observation supports a role for CD2AP in this
specialized cell junction.

Kim et al. (2003) studied Cd2ap heterozygous mice because they exhibit
reduced Cd2ap protein levels. Mice with Cd2ap haploinsufficiency
developed glomerular changes at 9 months of age and had increased
susceptibility to glomerular injury by nephrotoxic antibodies or immune
complexes. Electron microscopic analysis of podocytes revealed defects
in the formation of multivesicular bodies, suggesting an impairment of
the intracellular degradation pathway.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the CD2AP
gene to chromosome 6 (TMAP WI-17603).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
FOCAL SEGMENTAL GLOMERULOSCLEROSIS 3
CD2AP, IVS6, GC-CT, -1

In 2 patients with primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS3;
607832), Kim et al. (2003) identified a heterozygous splice site
mutation in the splice acceptor of exon 7 on one allele of the CD2AP
gene in which 2 nucleotides, GC, were replaced with CT. CD2AP expression
was lower in these 2 patients compared with control samples. Neither of
2 antibodies used recognized other protein products, suggesting that a
stable truncated CD2AP protein was not generated from mRNA carrying this
exon 7 splice site mutation.

.0002
FOCAL SEGMENTAL GLOMERULOSCLEROSIS 3
CD2AP, ARG612TER

In a boy with nephrotic syndrome associated with focal segmental
glomerulosclerosis (607832), Lowik et al. (2007) identified a homozygous
1834C-T transition in exon 18 of the CD2AP gene, resulting in an
arg612-to-ter (R612X) substitution at the C terminus. The mutation
occurred in the second putative actin-binding site in the supercoiled
domain and yielded a protein truncated by only 4%. The boy was born of
consanguineous parents of Mediterranean ancestry, each of whom was
unaffected and carried the mutation in heterozygous state, indicating
that heterozygosity for this mutation does not result in kidney disease.
At age 10 months, he showed failure to thrive and proteinuria associated
with FSGS, mesangial matrix expansion, and mild effacement of the
podocyte processes. There was no expression of the mutant protein in
patient lymphocytes, consistent with a complete loss of function. In
vitro functional expression studies showed that the mutant protein had
significantly decreased F-actin binding efficiency compared to wildtype
(6% of wildtype binding).

603831	TITLE *603831 PDZ DOMAIN-CONTAINING 1; PDZK1
;;PDZD1;;
C-TERMINAL LINKING AND MODULATING PROTEIN; CLAMP;;
CFTR-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN, 70-KD; CAP70
DESCRIPTION Custer et al. (1997) cloned a gene from rat kidney mRNA that encodes a
protein regulated by dietary phosphate. They designated the protein
Diphor-1 (dietary P(i)-regulated RNA-1) and found that it shares
homology with the PDZ domain-containing protein Na+/H+ exchanger
regulatory factor. Diphor-1 specifically increased Na(+)-dependent
phosphate uptake by 1.7 times when coexpressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes
with the Na(+)-P(i) cotransporter, indicating that it may play an
important role in cellular phosphate regulation. Diphor-1 mRNA
expression was upregulated several fold by a restricted phosphate diet,
highlighting the possible role of the protein in maintaining overall
phosphate homeostasis.

White et al. (1998) showed that PDZK1, a PDZ domain-containing protein
highly homologous to rat Diphor-1, is expressed in human kidney. Based
on its sequence similarity to rat Diphor-1, they considered PDZK1 a
likely candidate for autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets (ADHR;
193108), which maps to 12p13. However, they found by PCR analysis of a
human/rodent somatic cell hybrid mapping panel and by radiation hybrid
analysis that the PDZK1 gene maps to 1q21, thereby excluding it as a
candidate for ADHR.

Using the yeast 2-hybrid system, Kocher et al. (1998) identified PDZK1
as a protein interacting with MAP17 (607178), a 17-kD
membrane-associated protein. By in situ hybridization, they showed that
both proteins are upregulated in human carcinomas arising in kidney,
lung, colon, and breast. Using the yeast 2-hybrid system, Kocher et al.
(1999) found that PDZK1 interacts with CMOAT (ABCC2; 601107), a
canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter involved in
multidrug resistance. The finding was considered of particular interest
because proteins containing PDZ domains are involved in the clustering
and signaling pathways of membrane-associated proteins, including ion
channels. Therefore, the protein cluster formed by the association of
CMOAT, PDZK1, and MAP17 could play an important role in the cellular
mechanisms associated with multidrug resistance, and PDZK1 may represent
a new target in cancer cells resistant to chemotherapeutic agents.

The scavenger receptor class B type I (SRBI, or CD36L1; 601040),
mediates the selective uptake of cholesteryl esters from high density
lipoprotein and cholesterol secretion into bile in the liver. Ikemoto et
al. (2000) identified an SRBI-associated protein from rat liver membrane
extracts by using an affinity chromatography technique. The 523-amino
acid protein contains 4 PDZ domains (see 603199 for a discussion of PDZ)
and associates with the C terminus of SRBI using its N-terminal first
PDZ domain. Therefore, Ikemoto et al. (2000) denoted this protein as
CLAMP (C-terminal linking and modulating protein). CLAMP was located
mostly in the sinusoidal membranes, whereas SRBI was detected in both
sinusoidal and canalicular membranes. After the solubilization of the
liver membranes with Triton X-100, SRBI was immunoprecipitated with
anti-CLAMP monoclonal antibody, suggesting the association of these
proteins in vivo. By coexpressing SRBI with CLAMP in Chinese hamster
ovary cells, Ikemoto et al. (2000) observed an increase in the
expression level of SRBI, a reduction in the deacylation rate of the
cholesteryl esters taken up from HDL, and a change in the intracellular
distribution of a fluorescent lipid taken up from HDL. Taken together,
these data suggested that CLAMP is associated with SRBI in the liver
sinusoidal plasma membranes and may modulate intracellular transport and
metabolism of cholesteryl esters taken up from HDL.

Wang et al. (2000) identified a hydrophilic CFTR (602421)-binding
protein, CAP70, which is also concentrated on the apical surfaces. CAP70
had previously been identified by Kocher et al. (1998) as PDZK1. The
protein contains 4 PDZ domains, 3 of which are capable of binding to the
CFTR C terminus. Linking at least 2 CFTR molecules via cytoplasmic
C-terminal binding by either multivalent CAP70 or a bivalent monoclonal
antibody potentiates the CFTR chloride channel activity. Thus, the CFTR
channel can be switched to a more active conducting state via a
modification of intermolecular CFTR-CFTR contact that is enhanced by an
accessory protein.

Using in vitro pull-down assays, Thomson et al. (2005) determined that
human PDZK1 interacted with the sodium-hydrogen exchanger Nhe3 (SLC9A3;
182307) and the chloride-anion exchanger Cfex (SLC26A6) in rabbit renal
brush border membrane vesicles. The interactions were mediated via the
C-terminal PDZ-binding domains of Nhe3 and Cfex. Using Pdzk1-null mice,
Thomson et al. (2005) determined that brush border expression of Nhe3
was unaffected by loss of Pdzk1, but expression of Cfex was markedly
reduced. Functional activity of Cfex was also dramatically reduced in
Pdzk1-null mice.

GENE FAMILY

PDZ domains are central organizers of protein complexes at the plasma
membrane. Fanning and Anderson (1999) reviewed general concepts
concerning their biology. These included the structural basis for
specificity of their binding interactions and ideas about how they
organize both small local protein complexes used for signal transduction
(transducisomes) and larger 2-dimensional complexes like cell junctions
and plasma membrane domains. PDZ domains were originally identified as
conserved sequence elements within the postsynaptic density protein
PSD95 (602887), the Drosophila tumor suppressor dlg-A (600723), and the
tight junction protein ZO1 (601009). PDZ is an acronym derived from
these first 3 PDZ-containing proteins: PDS95/DLG/ZO1. Fanning and
Anderson (1999) stated that these 80- to 90-amino acid sequences had
been identified in more than 75 proteins and were characteristically
expressed in multiple copies within a single protein. They have a broad
species distribution and the overwhelming majority of proteins
containing them are associated with the plasma membrane. Although PDZ
domains are found in many different structures, each PDZ protein is
generally restricted to specific subcellular domains, such as synapses;
cell-cell contacts; or the apical, basal, or lateral cell surface. This
led to the speculation that PDZ domains evolved early to play a central
role in the organization of the plasma membrane domains.

ANIMAL MODEL

Kocher et al. (2003) developed Pdzk1 null mice. Mutant mice developed
normally, had no gross phenotypic abnormalities, and were fecund. Lack
of Pdzk1 altered the expression of selective ion channels in the kidney
and increased serum cholesterol levels. No significant redistribution of
proteins known to interact with Pdzk1, such as Map17, cmoat, and the
type IIa Na/Pi cotransporter, was observed. Kocher et al. (2003)
concluded that the lack of significant phenotype in Pdzk1-deficient mice
may be due to functional compensation by other Pdz domain-containing
proteins.

CLONING

By database searching with evolutionarily conserved sequences in the
TIPARP gene (612480), Katoh and Katoh (2003) identified 2 human genes,
FLJ22693 (PARP12) and ZAP (ZC3HAV1; 607312), that encode deduced
proteins with the same conserved regions: a WWE domain, a PARP-like
domain, and a TPH domain. The N-terminal region of the TPH domain in all
3 genes contains a CCCH-type zinc finger. Katoh and Katoh (2003) noted
that PARP12 and ZCH3HAV1 share 27.5% and 26% overall amino acid sequence
identity with TIPARP, respectively. The PARP12 gene encodes a deduced
701-amino acid protein.

;;CAMELLO, XENOPUS, HOMOLOG OF, 2; CML2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to the Xenopus
camello protein, Popsueva et al. (2001) identified CML2. The deduced
227-amino acid protein shares significant similarity with other camello
proteins, including a conserved N-terminal hydrophobic domain and
C-terminal consensus motifs of GCN5 (see 602301)-related
N-acetyltransferases.

By genomic sequence analysis, EST database analysis, and sequencing
genomic DNA from 24 individuals, Veiga-da-Cunha et al. (2010) found that
NAT8B contains a stop codon at codon 16. The only NAT8B sequence lacking
the stop codon at codon 16 was that reported by Popsueva et al. (2001),
which has a ser16 codon. Veiga-da-Cunha et al. (2010) suggested that
ser16 results from an extremely rare mutation or a sequencing error.
Translation of NAT8B was predicted to begin at the next in-frame
methionine, met25. This N-terminally truncated protein lacks a number of
conserved residues found in NAT8 (606716) and NAT8L (610647) homologs,
suggesting that NAT8B is inactive.

GENE FUNCTION

Veiga-da-Cunha et al. (2010) found that truncated NAT8B and NAT8
proteins beginning at met25 were inactive against a good NAT8 substrate.
They concluded that NAT8B is inactive in humans.

GENE STRUCTURE

Veiga-da-Cunha et al. (2010) determined that exon 2 of the NAT8B gene
contains the complete reading frame.

MAPPING

Veiga-da-Cunha et al. (2010) stated that the NAT8B gene is a tandem
duplication of the NAT8 gene on chromosome 2p13.1-p12.

610249	TITLE *610249 PROTEIN O-FUCOSYLTRANSFERASE 2; POFUT2
;;CHROMOSOME 21 OPEN READING FRAME 80; C21ORF80;;
KIAA0958
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Fucose is typically found as a terminal modification of branched chain
glycoconjugates, but it also exists in direct O-linkage to serine or
threonine residues within cystine knot motifs in epidermal growth factor
(EGF; 131530)-like repeats or thrombospondin (THBS; see 188060) type-1
repeats. POFUT2 is an O-fucosyltransferase that use THBS type-1 repeats
as substrates (Luo et al., 2006).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned POFUT2, which they designated
KIAA0958. The deduced protein contains 428 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected moderate expression in all adult and fetal tissues and specific
brain regions examined.

Menzel et al. (2004) identified 3 C21ORF80 splice variants, C21ORF80a,
C21ORF80b, and C21ORF80c, that encode deduced proteins containing 424,
380, and 429 amino acids, respectively. They identified C21ORF80
orthologs in C. elegans, Drosophila, and mouse. Northern blot analysis
revealed ubiquitous expression of a 3-kb C21ORF80 transcript. A weak
2.5-kb transcript was also expressed in brain. RT-PCR detected C21ORF80a
expression in fetal liver and peripheral blood lymphocytes. C21ORF80b
was expressed in spleen, lung, testis, bone marrow, fetal brain, fetal
liver, fetal kidney, thymus, pancreas, and prostate. C21ORF80c was
expressed in brain, heart, spleen, liver, lung, stomach, testis,
placenta, skin, fetal brain, fetal liver, fetal heart, thymus, pancreas,
mammary gland, and prostate. Fluorescence- or epitope-tagged C21ORF80
proteins localized in the cytoplasm of transfected cells and partially
overlapped with a Golgi marker protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Luo et al. (2006) showed that Ofut2, the Drosophila POFUT2 ortholog, is
a predominantly endoplasmic reticulum-localized enzyme that possesses
O-fucosyltransferase activity against THBS type-1 repeats, but not
EGF-like repeats.

GENE STRUCTURE

Menzel et al. (2004) determined that the POFUT2 gene contains 10 exons
and spans more than 24 kb.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1999) mapped the POFUT2
gene to chromosome 21. By genomic sequence analysis, Menzel et al.
(2004) mapped the POFUT2 gene to chromosome 21q22.3, between the ADARB1
(601218) and COL18A1 (120328) genes.

ANIMAL MODEL

Menzel et al. (2004) found that altering the expression of C. elegans
Pad2, the ortholog of C21ORF80, led to severe body malformation and
abnormal neuronal development.

SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY, PROXIMAL, ADULT, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
DESCRIPTION A number sign (#) is used with this entry because autosomal recessive
adult-onset spinal muscular atrophy type IV (SMA4) is caused by mutation
or deletion in the SMN1 gene (600354).

Allelic disorders with overlapping phenotypes of differing severity and
age at onset include SMA type I (253300), SMA type II (253550), and SMA
type III (253400).

CLINICAL FEATURES

Pearn et al. (1978) described 9 patients from 6 families with
adult-onset spinal muscular atrophy. The median age at onset was 35
years, and the mean age at initial medical presentation was 37 years.
The condition was relatively benign, with symmetrical proximal muscle
involvement and preservation of the distal musculature. Family studies
suggested autosomal recessive inheritance.

Brahe et al. (1995) reported 6 patients from 4 families with autosomal
recessive adult-onset SMA. Age at onset ranged from 20 to 32 years, and
symptoms included tongue fasciculations, hand tremor, symmetrical
weakness of the proximal muscles that was more severe in the lower
limbs, and atrophy of the quadriceps muscle. Three patients had
bilateral hypertrophy of the calves. One patient was very mildly
affected; 3 patients had done military service, apparently without
problems. In a letter, Zerres et al. (1995) noted that they defined SMA
type IV as onset after age 30; patients with onset before age 30 years
who retained the ability to walk were defined as having SMA type III.

Clermont et al. (1995) reported a 73-year-old woman who developed type
IV SMA at age 47, with proximal muscle weakness, muscular atrophy, and
patellar areflexia. Three of her 5 children had SMA type II, and all
died before age 15 years. Molecular analysis showed that the mother had
deletion of SMN exons 7 and 8 on both chromosomes, but no DNA from the
children was available. Clermont et al. (1995) concluded that adult and
childhood SMA are allelic disorders, emphasizing the continuum of
clinical phenotypes caused by SMN gene mutations and deletions.

CLINICAL MANAGEMENT

Weihl et al. (2006) reported increased quantitative muscle strength and
subjective function in 7 adult patients with SMA3/SMA4 who were treated
with oral valproate for a mean duration of 8 months. Most patients
reported improvement within a few months of beginning treatment. The
authors noted that previous studies (see Brichta et al., 2003) had
suggested that inhibitors of histone deacetylase, such as valproate, may
increase SMN2 gene transcription and result in increased production of
full-length SMN protein.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 6 patients with SMA4, Brahe et al. (1995) identified deletion of
exons 7 and 8 of the SMN1 gene, indicating that autosomal recessive
adult SMA is allelic to the childhood forms of SMA.

Mazzei et al. (2004) found evidence for a gene conversion event in SMN1
in 3 patients with SMA4, supporting the notion that a gene conversion
event is usually associated with a milder SMA phenotype and a later age
at disease onset.

- Modifying Factors

Wirth et al. (2006) analyzed SMN2 copy number in 115 patients with SMA3
or SMA4 who had confirmed homozygous absence of SMN1 and found that 62%
of SMA3 patients with age of onset less than 3 years had 2 or 3 SMN2
copies, whereas 65% of SMA3 patients with age of onset greater than 3
years had 4 to 5 SMN2 copies. Of the 4 adult-onset (SMA4) patients, 3
had 4 SMN2 copies and 1 had 6 copies. Wirth et al. (2006) concluded that
SMN2 may have a disease-modifying role in SMA, with a greater SMN2 copy
number associated with later onset and better prognosis.

- Heterogeneity

Hahnen et al. (1995) reported 4 patients with onset of SMA after age 30
who showed no homozygous deletion of exons 7 and 8 of the SMN1 gene,
suggesting genetic heterogeneity. However, the 4 patients with presumed
SMA IV had no family history, and spontaneous autosomal dominant
mutation at a different locus could not be excluded.

614121	TITLE *614121 POLY(A) POLYMERASE-ASSOCIATED DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 4; PAPD4
;;GLD2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PAPD4 is a poly(A) polymerase (PAP; EC 2.7.7.19). Gld2, the C. elegans
ortholog of PAPD4, functions as a cytoplasmic PAP that regulates stem
cell fate and is required for stem cells to complete meiosis (Kwak et
al., 2004).

CLONING

By searching a human database for sequences similar to C. elegans Gld2,
followed by PCR of a human breast cancer cell line, Kwak et al. (2004)
cloned PAPD4, which they called GLD2. The deduced 484-amino acid protein
contains a catalytic domain within a central domain that shares higher
similarity with C. elegans cytosolic Gld2 than with canonic nuclear PAP
(PAPOLA; 605553). Kwak et al. (2004) also cloned mouse Gld2, which
encodes a deduced 484-amino acid protein that shares 93% identity with
human GLD2.

GENE FUNCTION

Kwak et al. (2004) stated that C. elegans Gld2 has little PAP activity
until it is directed to RNA via interaction with Gld3, an RNA-binding
protein. They showed that Gld2 tethered to RNA via Ms2, a nonnative
RNA-binding protein, efficiently catalyzed polyadenylation of reporter
mRNA. Similarly, mouse and human GLD2 catalyzed polyadenylation of
reporter mRNA to which they were tethered.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the PAPD4 gene to chromosome 5q14.1 based on an
alignment of the PAPD4 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK095818) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;IRAK1-BINDING PROTEIN 1;;
SIGNALING MOLECULE THAT ASSOCIATES WITH PELLE-LIKE KINASE; SIMPL
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

IRAK1BP1 is required for TNF (191160)-dependent activation of NFKB (see
164011) activity (Luo et al., 2007).

CLONING

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis to identify potential regulators and/or
substrates of mouse Irak1 (300283), Vig et al. (2001) cloned mouse
Irak1bp1, which they called Simpl. By database analysis, they identified
the human ortholog. Mouse Simpl contain 259 amino acids. Northern blot
analysis of embryonic and adult mouse tissues revealed expression of a
1.35-kb transcript and a potential 2-kb variant. Highest expression was
detected in day-10 embryonic tissue and in adult testis, brain, kidney,
liver, and heart, with lower expression in lung and skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis of human embryonic
kidney cells, Vig et al. (2001) confirmed interaction between endogenous
IRAK1 and SIMPL. Reporter gene assays showed that overexpression of
mouse Simpl resulted in IL8 (146930) and NFKB activity. Mutation
analysis demonstrated that Simpl, like NFKB, was critical for cell
survival and that Simpl was required for NFKB activity induced by human
TNF, but not by human IL1 (147720). In addition, Simpl-induced
activation was dependent on intact IKKA (600664) and IKKB (603258). Vig
et al. (2001) proposed that SIMPL regulates NFKB activity by linking
IRAK1 to IKKA/IKKB-containing complexes.

Kwon et al. (2004) identified a nuclear localization signal in SIMPL,
and mutation analysis showed that nuclear localization of mouse Simpl
was required for TNFR1 (191190)-induced NFKB activity by enhancing the
transactivating activity of p65 (RELA; 164014). Kwon et al. (2004)
concluded that TNF-dependent activation of endogenous NFKB-dependent
gene expression requires nuclear relocalization of both NFKB and SIMPL.

By 2-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping analysis, Luo et al. (2007)
identified N-terminal basal and C-terminal TNF-induced phosphopeptides
in mouse Simpl. IRAK1 was able to phosphorylate Simpl and was required
for Simpl nuclear localization.

MAPPING

Gross (2013) mapped the IRAK1BP1 gene to chromosome 6q14.1 based on an
alignment of the IRAK1BP1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC112253) with the

;;PROTEIN-TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE 1C; PTP1C;;
TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE SHP1; SHP1;;
HEMATOPOIETIC CELL PHOSPHATASE; HCPH
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The growth and functional responses of hematopoietic cells are regulated
through tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins. Using a PCR approach, Yi
et al. (1991) identified 3 novel tyrosine protein phosphatases in
hematopoietic cells. One of these, expressed predominantly in
hematopoietic cells, was termed hematopoietic cell phosphatase (HCPH).
From a pre-B-cell-derived library, Matthews et al. (1992) cloned the
mouse PTPN6 cDNA, which they designated SHP (Src homology region
2-domain phosphatase). Yi et al. (1992) obtained complete cDNAs for both
the human and murine HCPH genes. The human gene was also cloned from a
breast cancer cell line and termed PTP1C by Shen et al. (1991). PTP1C
encodes a cytoplasmic protein that contains a phosphatase-catalytic
domain in the C-terminal region and 2 tandemly repeated, src-homology 2
(SH2) domains in the N-terminal region. SH2 domains were first
identified in the SRC gene family and found in a variety of proteins
involved in signal transduction. The SH2 domains may recognize
phosphorylated tyrosine residues and direct protein-protein
associations.

GENE STRUCTURE

Banville et al. (1995) demonstrated that the PTPN6 gene consists of 17
exons spanning 17 kb of DNA. Three nonhematopoietic PTPN6 transcripts
were identified in a variety of cell lines and were shown to be
transcribed from a common promoter. The hematopoietic form of the PTPN6
transcript is initiated at a downstream promoter separated by 7 kb from
the upstream promoter. This downstream promoter is active exclusively in
cells of the hematopoietic lineage.

MAPPING

Yi et al. (1992) mapped the human HCPH gene to chromosome 12p13-p12 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. By study of panels of somatic cell
hybrids and fluorescence in situ hybridization, Plutzky et al. (1992)
determined that the gene encoding the nontransmembrane protein-tyrosine
phosphatase of the nonreceptor type 6 is located in region 12p13.

Using a genomic probe in interspecific backcross analysis, Yi et al.
(1992) mapped the murine Hcph gene to chromosome 6 where it was found to
be tightly linked to the Tnfr2 and Ly4 genes.

GENE FUNCTION

Plutzky et al. (1992) suggested that since PTPN6 is expressed at high
levels in hematopoietic cells of all lineages and its expression is
induced early in hematopoietic differentiation, and since 12p13 is a
region commonly involved in leukemia-associated chromosomal
abnormalities, altered expression and/or structure of PTPN6 may play a
role in leukemogenesis.

T-cell lymphomas lose expression of SHP1 due to DNA methylation of its
promoter. Zhang et al. (2005) demonstrated that malignant T cells
expressed DNMT1 (126375) and that STAT3 (102582) could bind sites in the
SHP1 promoter in vitro. STAT3, DNMT1, and HDAC1 (601241) formed
complexes and bound to the SHP1 promoter in vivo. Antisense DNMT1 and
STAT3 small interfering RNA induced DNA demethylation in malignant T
cells and expression of SHP1. Zhang et al. (2005) concluded that STAT3
may transform cells by inducing epigenetic silencing of SHP1 in
cooperation with DNMT1 and HDAC1.

Combining computer modeling and single-cell measurements, Feinerman et
al. (2008) examined how endogenous variation in the expression levels of
signaling proteins might affect antigen responsiveness during T-cell
activation. They found that the CD8 (186910) coreceptor fine-tuned
activation thresholds, whereas SHP1 digitally regulated cell
responsiveness. Stochastic variation in expression of these proteins
generated substantial diversity of activation within a clonal population
of T cells, but coregulation of CD8 and SHP1 levels ultimately limited
this very diversity. Feinerman et al. (2008) concluded that these
findings revealed how eukaryotic cells can draw on regulated variation
in gene expression to achieve phenotypic variability in a controlled
manner.

In a cultured bovine retinal pericyte model, Geraldes et al. (2009)
demonstrated that hyperglycemia persistently activates PRKCD (176977)
and p38-alpha MAPK (MAPK14; 600289), thus increasing expression of SHP1,
and that this occurs independently of NFKB (see 164011) activation. This
signaling cascade leads to PDGF receptor-beta (PDGFRB; 173410)
dephosphorylation and a reduction in downstream signaling from this
receptor, resulting in pericyte apoptosis, the most specific vascular
histopathology associated with diabetic complications. The authors
observed increased PRKCD activity and an increase in the number of
acellular capillaries in diabetic mouse retinas, which were not
reversible with insulin treatment that achieved normoglycemia. Unlike
diabetic age-matched wildtype mice, diabetic Prkcd -/- mice did not show
activation of MAPK14 or SHP1, inhibition of PDGFB (190040) signaling in
vascular cells, or the presence of acellular capillaries. The authors
also observed PRKCD, MAPK14, and SHP1 activation in brain pericytes and
in the renal cortex of diabetic mice. Geraldes et al. (2009) concluded
that this represents a new signaling pathway by which hyperglycemia can
induce PDGFB resistance and increased vascular cell apoptosis to cause
diabetic vascular complications.

Khalil et al. (2012) showed that most proliferating germinal center B
cells do not demonstrate active B cell receptor signaling. Rather,
spontaneous and induced signaling was limited by increased phosphatase
activity. Accordingly, both SHP1 and SH2 domain-containing inositol
5-phosphatase (SHIP1; 601582) were hyperphosphorylated in germinal
center cells and remained colocalized with B cell receptors after
ligation. Furthermore, SHP1 was required for germinal cell maintenance.
Intriguingly, germinal center B cells in the cell cycle G2 period
regained responsiveness to B cell receptor stimulation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Beghini et al. (2000) examined the expression of PTPN6 in CD34+/CD117+
blasts from acute myeloid leukemia patients. They identified and cloned
novel PTPN6 mRNA species, derived from aberrant splicing within the
N-SH2 domain leading to retention of intron 3. Sequence analysis
revealed an A-to-G conversion of A7866, which represents the putative
branch site in IVS3 of PTPN6 mRNA. The level of the aberrant
intron-retaining splice variant, evaluated by semiquantitative RT-PCR,
was lower in CD117 +/- AML bone marrow mononuclear cells at remission
than at diagnosis, suggesting an involvement of posttranscriptional
PTPN6 processing in leukemogenesis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Mice with the recessive 'moth eaten' (me) or the allelic 'viable moth
eaten' mutations express a severe autoimmune and immunodeficiency
syndrome. Tsui et al. (1993) showed that the basic defect involves
lesions in the gene that encodes hematopoietic cell phosphatase. Shultz
et al. (1993) showed that 2 allelic 'motheaten' mutations result in
aberrant splicing of the Hcph transcript. Thus, 'motheaten' was the
first animal model for a specific protein-tyrosine phosphatase
deficiency, useful in determining the precise role of HCPH in
hematopoiesis.

Kamata et al. (2003) found that CD4 T cells in mice heterozygous for the
motheaten mutation express about half the normal amount of SHP1. Th2
cell differentiation and Th2 cytokine production in CD4 T cells and
specific cytokine production in mast cells were enhanced in these mice.
Eosinophilic infiltration and enhanced airway hyperresponsiveness were
also noted in OVA-sensitized heterozygous mice, but only after OVA
inhalation. Kamata et al. (2003) suggested that SHP1 may be a negative
regulator in the development of allergic responses such as allergic
asthma.

Dubois et al. (2006) demonstrated that 'viable motheaten' mice bearing a
functionally deficient SHP1 protein are markedly glucose tolerant and
insulin sensitive compared to wildtype littermates, due to enhanced
insulin receptor signaling to IRS (see 147545)-PI3K (see PIK3CA;
171834)-Akt (164730) in liver and muscle and increased phosphorylation
of CEACAM1 (109770). This metabolic phenotype was recapitulated in
normal mice through adenoviral expression of a dominant-negative
inactive form of SHP1 in the liver or hepatic knockdown of SHP1 by small
hairpin RNA-mediated gene silencing. Dubois et al. (2006) concluded that
SHP1 plays a crucial role in negatively modulating insulin action and
clearance in the liver, thereby regulating whole-body glucose
homeostasis.

Using chemical mutagenesis, Croker et al. (2008) obtained mice with a
recessive phenotype they termed 'spin,' for spontaneous inflammation.
Homozygous spin mice had chronic lesions in feet, salivary glands, and
lungs and antichromatin antibodies. Spin mice had enhanced resistance to
Listeria monocytogenes infection. Testing the suppressive effects of
mutations at other loci showed that the autoinflammatory phenotype of
spin mice required Myd88 (602170), Irak4 (606883), and Il1r1 (147810),
but not Ticam1 (607601), Stat1 (600555), or Tnf (191160). Spin mice
derived into a germ-free environment did not show either autoimmune or
autoinflammatory phenotypes. Positional cloning mapped spin to the
distal region of chromosome 6, and Croker et al. (2008) identified a
T-to-A transversion in exon 5 of the Ptpn6 gene, resulting in a
tyr208-to-asn (Y208N) substitution in the N-terminal SH2 domain of the
protein. Croker et al. (2008) concluded that the spin phenotype is due
to a viable hypomorphic allele of Ptpn6 and that spin autoimmunity is
driven by commensal microbes acting through the Tlr (e.g., TLR4; 603030)
pathway requiring Myd88, Irak4, and Il1r1.

PTPN6(spin) mice spontaneously develop a severe inflammatory syndrome
that resembles neutrophilic dermatosis in humans and is characterized by
persistent footpad swelling and suppurative inflammation. Lukens et al.
(2013) reported that receptor-interacting protein-1 (RIP1;
603453)-regulated interleukin 1-alpha (IL1A; 147760) production by
hematopoietic cells critically mediates chronic inflammatory disease in
Ptpn6(spin) mice, whereas inflammasome signaling and IL1-beta
(147720)-mediated events are dispensable. IL1A was also crucial for
exacerbated inflammatory responses and unremitting tissue damage upon
footpad microabrasion of Ptpn6(spin) mice. Notably, pharmacologic and
genetic blockade of the kinase RIP1 protected against wound-induced
inflammation and tissue damage in Ptpn6(spin) mice, whereas RIP3
(605817) deletion failed to do so. Moreover, RIP1-mediated inflammatory
cytokine production was attenuated by NF-kappa-B (see 164011) and ERK
(see 601795) inhibition. Lukens et al. (2013) concluded that
wound-induced tissue damage and chronic inflammation in Ptpn6(spin) mice
are critically dependent on RIP1-mediated IL1-alpha production, whereas
inflammasome signaling and RIP3-mediated necroptosis are dispensable.

602666	TITLE *602666 MYOSIN XVA; MYO15A
;;MYOSIN XV; MYO15
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Wang et al. (1998) isolated a partial MYO15A cDNA from a human
chromosome 17-specific human cDNA library. The deduced 1,585-amino acid
partial protein shares 99% amino acid identity with a mouse partial
protein isolated by Probst et al. (1998). MYO15A contains an N-terminal
motor domain, 2 light-chain binding IQ motifs, and a tail region
containing a MyTH4 and a talin (186745)-like domain. The extent of
sequence divergence of the MYO15A motor domain from other reported
myosins qualified MYO15A as a new branch of the myosin superfamily.
Northern blot analysis detected MYO15A expression in human fetal and
adult brain, and RT-PCR analysis detected expression in human fetal
cochlea. RNA dot-blot analysis showed expression in ovary, testis,
kidney, and pituitary gland.

Probst et al. (1998) isolated a partial mouse Myo15a clone. Northern
blot analysis detected Myo15a in adult mouse brain and kidney.

Liang et al. (1999) characterized the complete MYO15A sequence. The
3,530-residue protein has a calculated molecular mass of 395 kD. The
corresponding mouse protein contains 3,511 residues and shares 82%
overall identity. A full-length 11.9-kb mRNA, not including the poly(A)
tail, was detected. The MYO15A protein sequence was found to be unusual
for myosins in that it contains a 1,200-residue N-terminal extension,
encoded by exon 2, that precedes the conserved motor domain. Several
alternatively spliced transcripts were identified in both species,
including 1 transcript that skipped exon 2. There was high expression in
the adult pituitary gland.

Belyantseva et al. (2005) noted that the C terminus of MYO15A contains 2
repeats each composed of a MyTH4 and a FERM domain, separated by an SH3
domain, with a PDZ ligand at the C-terminal tip.

GENE FUNCTION

Belyantseva et al. (2005) determined that the C-terminal PDZ ligand of
mouse Myo15a interacted with the third PDZ domain of whirlin (WHRN;
607928), and this interaction was required for the targeting of whirlin
to the tips of stereocilia. Reintroduction of Myo15a into hair cells of
Myo15a-deficient mice restored the recruitment of endogenous whirlin to
the tips of stereocilia. Belyantseva et al. (2005) concluded that the
interaction of MYO15A with whirlin is a key event in hair bundle
morphogenesis.

Delprat et al. (2005) showed that whirlin, like myosin XVa, is present
at the very tip of rat stereocilium in the developing and mature hair
bundles of the cochlear and vestibular system. The myosin XVa SH3-MyTH4
region bound to the short isoform of whirlin (PR-PDZ3), whereas the
C-terminal MyTH4-FERM region of myosin XVa bound to the PDZ1 and PDZ2
domains of the long whirlin isoform. Delprat et al. (2005) concluded
that a direct myosin XVa/whirlin interaction at the stereocilia tip is
likely to control the elongation of stereocilia.

Manor et al. (2011) determined that Myo15a and whirlin interacted with
Eps8 (600206) at the tips of stereocilia in mouse inner and outer
cochlear and vestibular hair cells. Knockout of Eps8, like knockout of
Myo15a and whirlin, caused shortening of stereocilia and profound
deafness. Knockdown studies showed that Eps8 was dependent upon Myo15a
for its stereocilia localization. Knockdown of whirlin reduced
expression of both Myo15a and Eps8 at stereocilia tips. Overexpression
of Eps8 with Myo15a resulted in stereocilia elongation. In transfected
COS-7 cells, Myo15a and Eps8 expression cooperatively elongated actin
protrusions. Protein pull-down experiments with truncated proteins
revealed that the second MyTh4-FERM domain of the Myo15a tail interacted
predominantly with the C terminus of Eps8. The N terminus of Eps8
interacted with whirlin.

GENE STRUCTURE

Liang et al. (1999) determined that the MYO15A gene contains 66 exons
and spans about 71 kb.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected individuals from 3 unrelated families with autosomal
recessive congenital deafness (DFNB3; 600316), Wang et al. (1998)
identified homozygous mutations in the MYO15A gene
(602666.0001-602666.0003).

In 3 consanguineous families from Pakistan and India with DFNB3, Liburd
et al. (2001) identified homozygous mutations in the MYO15A gene
(602666.0004-602666.0006). In addition, a hemizygous missense mutation
(602666.0007) was found in a patient with Smith-Magenis syndrome
(182290) due to a deletion in chromosome 17p11.2. The patient had
moderately severe hearing loss. The unaffected mother was heterozygous
for the mutation.

Nal et al. (2007) identified 16 novel MYO15A mutations that cosegregated
with DFNB3 hearing loss in 20 families from Turkey, India, and Pakistan.
Two mutations (E1105X; 602666.0008 and 3334delG; 602666.0009) were
located in the alternatively-spliced exon 2 that encodes the large
N-terminal extension of the MYO15A protein. The findings indicated that
the long isoform of MYO15A is necessary for normal auditory function.

In a large multigenerational consanguineous Brazilian pedigree with
prelingual severe to profound sensorineural deafness, negative for
mutations in the deafness-associated GJB2 (121011) and GJB6 (604418)
genes and for the A1555G mitochondrial mutation in the MTRNR1 gene
(561000.0001), Lezirovitz et al. (2008) identified unexpected genetic
heterogeneity: 15 affected individuals from 'branch 2' of the family
were homozygous for a 1-bp deletion (10573delA; 602666.0012) in the
MYO15A gene, whereas 4 affected sibs from 'branch 1' and 1 individual
from 'branch 2' were compound heterozygous for 10573delA and a 4-bp
deletion (602666.0013) in MYO15A. In 1 patient, only the 10573delA
mutation could be identified. No mutations in MYO15A were identified in
5 patients from 2 additional branches of the family.

ANIMAL MODEL

Shaker-2 (sh2) is a recessive mouse mutation on chromosome 11 that arose
in the progeny of an x-ray irradiated mouse. Affected mice lack a normal
startle response to sound and show no auditory brainstem responses to
sound pressure levels up to high levels, indicating profound deafness.
Associated vestibular defects cause head-tossing and circling behavior.
The stereociliary bundles on both the inner and outer hair cells of
1-month-old shaker-2 mice are short and dysmorphic, but are arrayed in a
nearly normal pattern. Complete 1-Mb yeast artificial chromosome (YAC)
and bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) contigs that spanned the
shaker-2 critical region were generated. Probst et al. (1998) used a BAC
transgene from the shaker-2 critical region to correct the vestibular
defects, deafness, and inner ear morphology of shaker-2 mice. Using this
approach, the authors identified an unconventional myosin gene,
designated Myo15. Shaker-2 mice were found to have an amino acid
substitution at a highly conserved position within the motor domain of
this myosin. Auditory hair cells of shaker-2 mice have very short
stereocilia and a long actin-containing protrusion extending from the
basal end. This histopathology suggested that Myo15 is necessary for
actin organization in the hair cells of the cochlea.

Anderson et al. (2000) described the shaker-2(J) lesion, which is a
14.7-kb deletion that removes the last 6 exons from the 3-prime terminus
of the Myo15 transcript. These exons encode a FERM (F, ezrin, radixin,
and moesin) domain that may interact with integral membrane proteins.
Despite the deletion of 6 exons, in situ hybridization revealed that
Myo15 mRNA transcripts and protein were present in the postnatal day 1
shaker-2J inner ear, suggesting that the FERM domain is critical for the
development of normal hearing and balance. Myo15 transcripts were first
detectable at embryonic day 13.5 in wildtype mice. Myo15 transcripts in
the mouse inner ear were restricted to the sensory epithelium of the
developing cristae ampularis, macula utriculi, and macula sacculi of the
vestibular system, as well as to the developing organ of Corti. Similar
to shaker-2, shaker-2J alleles result in abnormally short hair cell
stereocilia in the cochlear and vestibular systems. The authors
suggested that Myo15 may be important for both the structure and
function of these sensory epithelia.

The MYO15, MYO6 (600970), and MYO7A (276903) genes are essential for
hearing in both humans and mice. Despite widespread expression,
homozygosity for mutations in these genes only results in auditory or
ocular dysfunction. The pirouette (pi) mouse exhibits deafness and inner
ear pathology resembling that of Myo15 mutant mice. Karolyi et al.
(2003) crossed shaker-2 mice to Myo6, Myo7a, and pi mutant mouse
strains. Viable double-mutant homozygotes were obtained from each cross,
and hearing in doubly heterozygous mice was similar to singly
heterozygous mice. All critical cell types of the cochlear sensory
epithelium were present in double-mutant mice, and cochlear stereocilia
exhibited a superimposition of single-mutant phenotypes. Karolyi et al.
(2003) suggested that the function of Myo15 is distinct from that of
Myo6, Myo7a, or pi in development and/or maintenance of stereocilia.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
DEAFNESS, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 3
MYO15A, ILE892PHE

In affected individuals with recessive congenital deafness (DFNB3;
600316) from a kindred in Bengkala, an Indonesian village on the north
shore of Bali, Wang et al. (1998) found homozygosity for an
ile892-to-phe (I892F) mutation in the MYO15 gene.

Friedman et al. (1995) had reported that 2% of the residents of Bengkala
had DFNB3. The remote village dated to at least the 13th century as
documented by charters inscribed in Sanskrit on metallic plates. Of the
2,185 residents, 47 had profound deafness of the type described as
DFNB3. As an adaptation to the high percentage of deaf individuals, the
citizens of Bengkala had developed a unique sign language used by most
of the hearing persons as well as the deaf villagers. Deaf couples
produced all deaf progeny. In 4- and 5-generation Bengkala kindreds, 2
of which were illustrated, there were no consanguineous marriages.

In a consanguineous Indian family, Wang et al. (1998) found that
individuals with congenital deafness (DFNB3; 600316) were homozygous for
an asn890-to-tyr (N890Y) missense mutation in the MYO15 gene.

.0003
DEAFNESS, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 3
MYO15A, LYS1300TER

In a consanguineous Indian family, Wang et al. (1998) found that
individuals with congenital deafness (DFNB3; 600316) carried a
lys1300-to-ter (K1300X) nonsense mutation in the MYO15 gene.

DEAFNESS, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 3
MYO15A, GLN1229TER

In profoundly deaf (DFNB3; 600316) members of a Pakistani family, Liburd
et al. (2001) found a homozygous C-to-T transition at nucleotide 4023 in
exon 3 of the MYO15A gene, resulting in a gln1229-to-ter (Q1229X)
substitution.

.0005
DEAFNESS, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 3
MYO15A, IVS4DS, G-T, +1

In a consanguineous Pakistani family, Liburd et al. (2001) found that
deaf (DFNB3; 600316) members had a homozygous splice donor site mutation
in the MYO15A gene, IVS4+1G-T.

.0006
DEAFNESS, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 3
MYO15A, GLN2716HIS

In a consanguineous Pakistani family, Liburd et al. (2001) found that 3
deaf (DFNB3; 600316) sibs were homozygous for a G-to-T transversion at
nucleotide 8486 in exon 44 of the MYO15A gene, resulting in a
gln2716-to-his (Q2716H) substitution.

.0007
DEAFNESS, WITH SMITH-MAGENIS SYNDROME
MYO15A, THR2205ILE

In 1 of 8 patients from North America with Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS;
182290) due to deletion in 17p11.2, Liburd et al. (2001) found that
moderately severe sensorineural hearing loss (DFNB3; 600316) was
associated with hemizygosity for a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 6952
of the MYO15A gene, resulting in a thr2205-to-ile (T2205I) substitution.
The mother, who had normal hearing, was heterozygous for T2205I. Thus,
the SMS deletion in this patient appeared to have occurred in a gamete
from the father.

MYO15A, GLU1105TER

In affected members of a consanguineous Pakistani family with DFNB3
(600316), Nal et al. (2007) identified a homozygous 3313G-T transversion
in exon 2 of the MYO15A gene, resulting in a glu1105-to-ter (E1105X)
substitution in the long N-terminal extension.

In affected members of a consanguineous Pakistani family with DFNB3
(600316), Nal et al. (2007) identified a homozygous 1-bp deletion
(3334delG) in exon 2 of the MYO15A gene, resulting in a frameshift and
premature protein truncation.

In affected members of a consanguineous Turkish family with DFNB3
(600316), Kalay et al. (2007) identified a homozygous G-to-T
transversion at nucleotide 5492 in exon 21 of the MYO15A gene, resulting
in a gly1831-to-val (G1831V) substitution in the motor domain of the
protein.

MYO15A, IVS50AS, G-C, -1

In affected members of a consanguineous Turkish family with DFNB3
(600316), Kalay et al. (2007) identified a homozygous G-to-C
transversion affecting the acceptor site of intron 50 (-1G-C).
Computational splice site analysis of the variant predicted that the
splice acceptor site of intron 50 is destroyed.

.0012
DEAFNESS, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 3
MYO15A, 1-BP DEL, 10573A

In 15 members of a large consanguineous Brazilian pedigree with
prelingual severe to profound sensorineural deafness (600316),
Lezirovitz et al. (2008) identified homozygosity for a 1-bp deletion
(10573delA) in exon 66 of the MYO15A gene, causing a frameshift that was
predicted to eliminate the last 6 amino acids at the C terminus,
including the class 1 PDZ binding ligand, and to abolish the natural
stop codon, thus leading to the addition of 28 novel amino acids. In
another affected individual from the same branch of the family, only a
single mutated 10573delA allele could be identified. Another 5 affected
individuals were found to be compound heterozygous for 10573delA and a
4-bp deletion in the MYO15A gene (602666.0013).

In 5 members of a large consanguineous Brazilian pedigree with
prelingual severe to profound sensorineural deafness (600316),
Lezirovitz et al. (2008) identified compound heterozygosity for
10573delA (602666.0012) and a 4-bp deletion (9957delTGAC) in exon 62 of
the MYO15A gene, predicted to cause a premature stop codon that would
eliminate 211 amino acids from the C terminus, including approximately
half of the second FERM domain and the entire class 1 PDZ ligand.

300597	TITLE *300597 G ANTIGEN 4; GAGE4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Human melanoma cells express several distinct antigens that are
recognized by autologous cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTLs). One class of
these antigens is encoded by genes, such as MAGE1 (MAGEA1; 300016),
MAGE3 (MAGEA3; 300174), and BAGE (605167), that are expressed in a large
fraction of tumors of various histologic types but are silent in normal
adult tissues, except for testis. Van den Eynde et al. (1995) identified
GAGE1 (300594) as a gene encoding an antigen that is present on melanoma
MZ2-MEL cells and is recognized by autologous CTLs. By screening a
melanoma MZ2-MEL cDNA library with a GAGE1 cDNA, they isolated cDNAs
representing 5 genes with sequence similarity to GAGE1. They named the
genes GAGE2 (GAGE2C; 300595), GAGE3 (300596), GAGE4, GAGE5 (300598), and
GAGE6 (300599). The GAGE2 to -6 cDNAs differ mainly by single nucleotide
substitutions that are scattered throughout the sequence. The deduced
GAGE4 protein has 117 amino acids. RT-PCR using primers common to GAGE1
to -6 found expression of these genes in various tumors but no
expression in any normal adult tissue tested except testis.

MAPPING

Chen et al. (2006) determined that GAGE4 is 1 of several copies of a
GAGE gene repeated on chromosome Xp11.23.

601863	TITLE *601863 REGULATORY FACTOR X, 5; RFX5
DESCRIPTION Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules are
heterodimeric transmembrane glycoproteins consisting of alpha and beta
chains. In man, there are 3 MHC class II isotypes: HLA-DR, -DP, and -DQ.
MHC class II molecules play a key role in the immune system. They
present exogenous antigenic peptides to the receptor of CD4+ T-helper
lymphocytes, thereby triggering the antigen-specific T-cell activation
events required for the initiation and sustenance of immune responses.
Durand et al. (1997) noted that the crucial role in the control of the
immune response is exemplified by the finding that ectopic or aberrantly
high levels of MHC class II expression is associated with autoimmune
diseases, while a lack of MHC class II expression results in a severe
immunodeficiency syndrome called MHC class II deficiency, or the bare
lymphocyte syndrome type II (BLS; 209920). At least 4 complementation
groups have been identified in B-cell lines established from patients
with BLS. The molecular defect responsible for complementation group A
resides in the gene encoding CIITA (MHC2TA; 600005). CIITA is a
non-DNA-binding transactivator that functions as a molecular switch
controlling both cell-type-specific and inducible MHC class II gene
transcription. In contrast, the defects in complementation groups B, C,
and D all lead to a deficiency in RFX, a nuclear protein complex that
binds to the X box of MHC class II promoters (see RFX2; 142765). The
lack of RFX binding activity in complementation group C results from
mutations in the gene encoding the 75-kD subunit of RFX (Steimle et al.,
1995). This gene was called RFX5 because it is the fifth member of the
growing family of DNA-binding proteins sharing a novel and highly
characteristic DNA-binding domain called the RFX motif.

Two of the genes defective in the 5 complementation groups identified in
class II-negative bare lymphocyte syndrome or in corresponding
laboratory mutants have been cloned (Mach et al., 1996). One gene
encodes RFX5; the other, MHC2TA (CIITA), encodes a large protein with a
defined acidic transcriptional activation domain. The latter protein
does not interact with DNA. Scholl et al. (1997) demonstrated that RFX5
can activate transcription only in cooperation with CIITA. RFX5 and
CIITA associate to form a complex capable of activating transcription
from class II MHC promoters. In this complex, promoter specificity is
determined by the DNA binding domain of RFX5 and the general
transcription apparatus is recruited by the acidic activation domain of
CIITA.

Nekrep et al. (2000) demonstrated a direct interaction between the C
terminus of RFXAP (601861) and RFXANK (603200); mutant RFXAP or RFXANK
proteins failed to bind. The authors found that RFX5 binds only to the
RFXANK-RFXAP scaffold and not to either protein alone. However, neither
the scaffold nor RFX5 alone can bind DNA. Nekrep et al. (2000) concluded
that the binding of the RFXANK-RFXAP scaffold to RFX5 leads to a
conformational change in the latter that exposes the DNA-binding domain
of RFX5. The DNA-binding domain of RFX5 anchors the RFX complex to MHC
class II X and S promoter boxes. Another part of the RFX5 protein
interacts with MHC2TA. The authors pointed out that mutation of either
protein in complementation group B or group D of BLS patients prevents
its binding to the other protein, explaining why MHC class II promoters
are bare in the bare lymphocyte syndrome.

Emery et al. (1996) reviewed RFX1, RFX5, and other members of the RFX
family of DNA-binding proteins.

Villard et al. (1997) mapped the RFX5 gene to chromosome 1q21 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

Villard et al. (1997) characterized the mutations in 4 patients with MHC
class II deficiency known to harbor a defect in the RFX5 gene.

Hosts and pathogens evolve various responses for controlling infection
and evading destruction, respectively. Using column chromatography,
Zhong et al. (2001) identified a factor in Chlamydia trachomatis, the
causative organism of trachoma and chronic urogenital infection, that
degrades the transcription factors RFX5 and USF1 (191523). The
degradation of these host factors correlates with the suppression of MHC
class I and class II antigen expression in infected cells, thereby
suppressing the host immune response.

Nekrep et al. (2002) identified an arg149-to-gln mutation (R149Q;
601863.0005) in the DNA-binding domain of RFX5 (residues 92 to 168) in
cell lines (termed 'Ker' cell lines) derived from the histoidentical
twins lacking MHC class II transcription reported by Wolf et al. (1995)
and Douhan et al. (1996). Functional and structural modeling analyses
indicated that the mutant protein was incapable of binding the X box of
the HLA-DRA (142860) promoter, whereas expression of wildtype RFX5 in
the Ker cell lines rescued MHC class II expression.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
BARE LYMPHOCYTE SYNDROME, TYPE II, COMPLEMENTATION GROUP C
RFX5, IVS2DS, G-A, +5

In 2 sibs, identified as THF and EDF, with bare lymphocyte syndrome type
II, complementation group C (209920), Villard et al. (1997) demonstrated
a 10-nucleotide deletion involving nucleotides 259-268 in the RFX5 gene
upstream of the DNA-binding domain region. The deletion led to a
frameshift followed by an out-of-frame stop codon situated 66
nucleotides downstream. Only the deleted form of RFX5 mRNA was present
in these sibs. Studies of genomic DNA demonstrated that the
10-nucleotide deletion resulted from a point mutation in a splice donor
site. The primary mutation was the G-to-A transition at position +5 in
the splice donor site situated 3-prime of exon 2. This resulted in the
use of a cryptic splice donor site situated 10 nucleotides upstream in
exon 2 and hence in the excision of the last 10 nucleotides of exon 2
from the mRNA. Both parents were heterozygous for the mutation.

.0002
BARE LYMPHOCYTE SYNDROME, TYPE II, COMPLEMENTATION GROUP C
RFX5, 1032C-T

In a patient identified as Ro, with bare lymphocyte syndrome type II,
complementation group C (209920), Steimle et al. (1995) demonstrated and
Villard et al. (1997) confirmed the presence of a point mutation at
nucleotide 1032 converting an arginine codon (CGA) to a premature stop
codon (TGA). Villard et al. (1997) demonstrated that the patient was
homozygous for the mutated allele, whereas both parents were
heterozygous.

.0003
BARE LYMPHOCYTE SYNDROME, TYPE II, COMPLEMENTATION GROUP C
RFX5, IVS4AS, G-A, -1

In a patient identified as SJO, with bare lymphocyte syndrome type II,
complementation group C (209920), Villard et al. (1997) identified
compound heterozygosity of the RFX5 gene, one allele containing a G-to-A
transition at position -1 resulting in the use of a cryptic splice
acceptor site situated 5 nucleotides downstream in exon 5 and deletion
of the first 5 nucleotides (386-390) of exon 5 from the mRNA. The
precise mutation affecting the second RFX5 allele in SJO had not been
defined; however, no intact mRNA derived from that allele was detectable
in SJO (Steimle et al., 1995).

.0004
BARE LYMPHOCYTE SYNDROME, TYPE II, COMPLEMENTATION GROUP C
RFX5, 4-BP DEL, IVS-AS, G-A, -1

Peijnenburg et al. (1999) fused fibroblasts of a patient with bare
lymphocyte syndrome type II, complementation group C (209920), with
fibroblasts derived from patients representative of each of the 4
complementation groups. Transient heterokaryon analysis indicated that
the patient belonged to complementation group C. Furthermore,
transfection of wildtype RFX5 cDNA into the patient's fibroblasts
resulted in correction of the defect. Mutation analysis revealed that
the RFX5 mRNA lacked 4 nucleotides and that this deletion was a
consequence of a G-to-A transition in a splice acceptor site. The
patient was found to be homozygous for the splice site mutation. The
nucleotides deleted were CAAG at positions 312-315 of the RFX5 cDNA. The
deletion led to a frameshift and an out of frame stop codon located at
nucleotides 403-405 of the wildtype RFX5 cDNA sequence. As a result, the
mutated RFX5 mRNA encoded a truncated protein of 82 amino acids which
lacked the DNA binding domain (DBD). The presence of the G-to-A point
mutation and the use of a cryptic splice acceptor site (aCAAG)
apparently resulted in an RFX5 mRNA from which 4 nucleotides of the
particular exon were spliced out. Both parents were heterozygous for the
mutation.

.0005
BARE LYMPHOCYTE SYNDROME, TYPE II, COMPLEMENTATION GROUP E
RFX5, ARG149GLN

In cell lines derived from histochemical twins with the putative fifth
bare lymphocyte syndrome complementation group (209920), Nekrep et al.
(2002) identified a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 446 of the RFX5
gene, resulting in an arg149-to-gln (R149Q) mutation in the DNA-binding
domain.

602307	TITLE *602307 WW DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; WWP1
;;WW DOMAIN-CONTAINING E3 UBIQUITIN PROTEIN LIGASE 1;;
TGIF-INTERACTING UBIQUITIN LIGASE 1; TIUL1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

WWP1 belongs to the NEDD4 (602278) protein family. NEDD4 family proteins
function as E3 ubiquitin ligases and are involved in protein
trafficking, particularly in the targeting of proteins to proteosomes
and lysosomes (Flasza et al., 2002).

CLONING

The WW domain is a 35- to 40-amino acid protein-protein interaction
motif characterized by 4 conserved aromatic residues, 2 of which are
tryptophan. Using COLT (cloning of ligand targets), Pirozzi et al.
(1997) screened human bone marrow and brain cDNA expression libraries
with putative WW domain peptide ligand sequences and recovered 3
distinct proteins, WWP1, WWP2 (602308), and WWP3 (602625). WWP1 contains
4 tandem WW domains and a partial HECT (homologous to the E6-associated
protein carboxyl terminus) domain, which is associated with
ubiquitin-protein ligase activity. Pirozzi et al. (1997) noted the
similarities between WWP1 and NEDD4 and suggested that WWP1 and WWP2
belong to a family of NEDD4-like proteins.

By Northern blot analysis, Wood et al. (1998) detected a 4.5-kb WWP1
transcript, which they called AIP5, in heart, brain, placenta, lung,
liver, muscle, kidney, and pancreas. Expression was particularly high in
heart and skeletal muscle.

By RT-PCR of the T47D mammary carcinoma cell line, Flasza et al. (2002)
cloned full-length WWP1 and 5 splice variants. The full-length 922-amino
acid WWP1 isoform has an N-terminal C2 domain, which is a membrane lipid
interaction motif, followed by the WW domains and C-terminal HECT
domain. Three of the WWP1 splice variants encode isoforms with deletions
of either the entire C2 domain or the C-terminal end of the C2 domain.
The other 2 variants encode short isoforms that are truncated within or
before the C2 domain. RT-PCR detected WWP1 expression in all adult and
fetal tissues examined. Expression of full-length WWP1 and the 3 WWP1
variants encoding isoforms with C2 deletions appeared to be regulated in
a tissue-specific fashion. The 2 WWP1 variants encoding truncated
peptides were not detected in any normal human tissues examined.

Using immunofluorescence analysis, Seo et al. (2004) detected Wwp1,
which they called Tiul1, in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of canine and
mink epithelial cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using in vitro assays, Pirozzi et al. (1997) showed that individual WW
domains of WWP1, WWP2, and WWP3 could selectively bind particular
peptide ligands.

Seo et al. (2004) detected an interaction between mouse Smad7 (602932)
and human TIUL1 in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a placenta cDNA library,
and they confirmed the interaction using canine, mink, monkey, and human
epithelial cell lines. Endogenous Smad7 and Tiul1 interacted independent
of TGF-beta (TGFB1; 190180) signaling, and the interaction led to
efficient ubiquitination of activated TGF-beta receptor-1 (TGFBR1;
190181), with subsequent receptor degradation. Endogenous TIUL1 also
interacted with SMAD2 (601366)/SMAD3 (603109) and the nuclear
corepressor TGIF (602630) following TGF-beta treatment of human
embryonic kidney cells, and this interaction led to ubiquitination and
degradation of SMAD2. Overexpression of human TIUL1 in canine kidney
cells suppressed TGF-beta-induced growth arrest, and this suppression
required the catalytic cysteine (cys890) in the HECT domain of TIUL1.
Conversely, knockdown of endogenous Tiul1 expression by small
interfering RNA increased the sensitivity of cells to TGF-beta. Seo et
al. (2004) concluded that TIUL1 negatively regulates TGF-beta signaling
by directing the degradation of active components of the TGF-beta
network.

Carrano et al. (2009) identified Wwp1 as a positive regulator of life
span in C. elegans in response to dietary restriction. Overexpression of
Wwp1 in worms extended life span by up to 20% under conditions of ad
libitum feeding. Conversely, reduction of Wwp1 completely suppressed the
extended longevity of diet-restricted animals. The E2
ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc18, which is homologous to human UBE2L3
(603721), interacted with Wwp1 and was required for Wwp1 ubiquitin
ligase activity and the extended longevity of worms overexpressing Wwp1.
Carrano et al. (2009) concluded that Wwp1 and Ubc18 function to
ubiquitinate substrates that regulate longevity induced by diet
restriction.

MAPPING

Using FISH, Flasza et al. (2002) mapped the WWP1 gene to chromosome
8q21. They identified a WWP1 pseudogene on chromosome 3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Muscular dystrophy in chickens is transmitted codominantly by a single
gene, but the phenotype is modified by other background genes. Matsumoto
et al. (2008) identified a mutation in the Wwp1 gene that led to an
arg441-to-glu (R441Q) substitution in dystrophic chickens. Full-length
chicken Wwp1 shares 83% amino acid identity with human WWP1 and contains
a C2 domain, followed by 3 WW domains and a C-terminal HECT domain. The
R441Q substitution occurred between WW domains 1 and 2 within a region
highly conserved among tetrapods and snakes, including 100% conservation
of the 20 amino acids immediately surrounding R441.

614026	TITLE *614026 KINESIN FAMILY MEMBER 26B; KIF26B
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

KIF26B belongs to the large kinesin family of intracellular motor
proteins. Kinesins transport organelles and other cargo along
microtubules and have a role in cell signaling (summary by Uchiyama et
al., 2010).

CLONING

Uchiyama et al. (2010) cloned mouse Kif26b, which encodes a 2,112-amino
acid protein that shares 87% identity with human KIF26B. Within the
N-terminal kinesin motor domain, the mouse and human proteins share 96%
identity. In situ hybridization of embryonic mice revealed Kif26b
expression in limb buds, metanephroi, and central nervous system. In
embryonic kidney, Kif26b was expressed in uncommitted mesenchyme, but
not in more differentiated structures, including renal vesicles and
comma-shaped bodies. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that Kif26b
localized to the cytosol of mesenchymal cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Uchiyama et al. (2010) found that expression of Kif26b was downregulated
in Sall1 (602218)-null embryonic mouse metanephroi. They identified
multiple Sall1-binding sequences in the Kif26b promoter, and chromatin
immunoprecipitation and reporter gene assays confirmed that Sall1 bound
and activated the Kif26b promoter. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments and
pull-down assays showed that mouse Kif26b interacted with the nonmuscle
myosin Myh10 (160776).

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the KIF26B gene to chromosome 1q44 based on an
alignment of the KIF26B sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK001019) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

ANIMAL MODEL

Uchiyama et al. (2010) found that Kif26b -/- mice were born at the
expected mendelian frequency. However, Kif26b -/- mice died within 24
hours of birth with missing or underdeveloped kidneys, although other
organs appeared normal. Kif26b +/- mice were viable and fertile. In many
Kif26b -/- embryos, uretic buds failed to invade and branch into the
mesenchyme, resulting in disappearance of the kidney by embryonic day
14.5. Other Kif26b -/- embryos showed invasion of the uretic bud into
mesenchyme, but to a lesser extent than in wildtype mice. In Kif26b -/-
mesenchyme, expression of Gdnf (600837) was not maintained, and
expression of integrin alpha-8 (ITGA8; 604063) and basolateral
N-cadherin (CDH2; 114020) was reduced, suggesting both a failure in
uretic bud attraction and loss of basolateral integrity and cell-cell
adhesion. Uchiyama et al. (2010) proposed that lack of Kif26b in Kif26b
-/- cells may destabilize Myh10-mediated cell-cell adhesion in
developing kidney.

605043	TITLE *605043 MEDIATOR COMPLEX SUBUNIT 26; MED26
;;COFACTOR REQUIRED FOR SP1 TRANSCRIPTIONAL ACTIVATION, SUBUNIT 7; CRSP7;;
CRSP, 70-KD SUBUNIT; CRSP70
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mediator complexes are evolutionarily conserved regulatory complexes
required for transcriptional activation or repression. Mediator
complexes exist in multiple functionally distinct forms that share
common core subunits. MED26 is an accessory subunit of a Mediator
complex involved in transcriptional activation and elongation (summary
by Takahashi et al., 2011).

CLONING

Transcriptional activation by enhancer-binding factors, such as SP1
(189906), requires interaction with the TFIID complex (see TAF2A;
313650). To identify other potential SP1 cofactors, Ryu et al. (1999)
developed an in vitro transcription assay consisting of TFIIA (GTF2A1;
600520), RNA polymerase II (pol II) (see POLR2A; 180660), and the basal
transcription factors GTF2B (189963), GTF2E (189962), GTF2F (189968),
and GTF2H (189972), supplemented with TFIID or TBP (600075). By
sequential chromatography, they identified a Mediator complex, which
they called CRSP (cofactor required for SP1 activation), that, along
with TFIID, was required for efficient activation by SP1. CRSP behaved
as a single complex of approximately 700 kD. Ryu et al. (1999)
tentatively identified 9 polypeptides as CRSP subunits. Using
microsequence peptide analysis, they cloned a CRSP cDNA encoding a 70-kD
protein, CRSP7, which they termed CRSP70.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoprecipitation of human cell lines expressing Mediator subunits
with epitope tags, Takahashi et al. (2011) found that MED26
coprecipitated with TFIID and 2 ELL (600284)- and EAF (see
608315)-containing complexes: the multimeric super elongation complex
(SEC) and another complex containing KIAA0947 and NARG2 (610835). The
C-terminal domain (amino acids 421 to 600) of MED26 was sufficient for
its assembly into Mediator and interaction with pol II. The MED26
N-terminal domain (NTD), which forms a 4-helix bundle, contained
overlapping docking sites for TFIID, SEC, and the non-SEC
ELL/EAF-containing complex. The isolated MED26 NTD functioned as a
strong activator of reporter gene expression. Knockdown of MED26 in
human cell lines and mouse embryonic stem cells reduced cell
proliferation and downregulated expression of MYC (190080), HSP70 (see
140550), and SNAI2 (602150). MED26 knockdown also delayed synthesis of
HSP70 mRNA in heat-shocked 293T cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation
analysis showed that depletion of MED26 reduced phosphorylation of the
pol II C-terminal domain and reduced recruitment of pol II and the SEC
components AFF4 (604417) and CDK9 (603251) to both the promoter regions
and bodies of the MYC and HSP70 genes. Takahashi et al. (2011)
hypothesized that MED26 may function as a molecular switch that
interacts first with the pol II initiation complex through direct
interactions with TFIID, then exchanges TFIID for pol II elongation
factors to facilitate productive elongation.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the MED26 gene to chromosome 19p13.11 based on an
alignment of the MED26 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF104253) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

612617	TITLE *612617 LATE CORNIFIED ENVELOPE PROTEIN 3E; LCE3E
;;LATE ENVELOPE PROTEIN 17; LEP17
DESCRIPTION For background information on the LCE gene cluster, see 612603.

CLONING

By database analysis to identify human orthologs of mouse genes encoding
late envelope proteins (LEPs), Marshall et al. (2001) identified LCE3E,
which they called LEP17. RT-PCR detected LEP17 in human skin, esophagus,
and heart.

Using real-time PCR, Jackson et al. (2005) detected very low LCE3E
expression in adult and fetal skin. Low LCE3E expression was also
detected in internal epithelia, including vulva, tongue, and esophagus.

GENE FUNCTION

Jackson et al. (2005) showed that expression of LCE3E was upregulated in
cultured normal human keratinocytes by ultraviolet radiation. At 48
hours after irradiation, the level of LCE3E was upregulated over
350-fold compared with mock-irradiated controls. LCE3E expression was
not regulated by calcium.

GENE STRUCTURE

Jackson et al. (2005) determined that LCE3E is a single-exon gene.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Marshall et al. (2001) mapped the LCE3E
gene within the LCE gene cluster on chromosome 1q21. Jackson et al.
(2005) determined that the LCE3E gene lies within intron 1 of the LCE3C
gene (612615) and is oriented in the opposite direction. They stated
that the mouse Lce3e gene maps to a syntenic LCE gene cluster on
chromosome 3F1.

611900	TITLE *611900 METALLOPHOSPHOESTERASE 1; MPPE1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

While characterizing a cosmid containing the 3-prime untranslated region
(UTR) of the GNAL gene (139312), Vuoristo and Ala-Kokko (2001)
identified a transcript corresponding to several human brain ESTs. They
cloned the cDNA for this gene, which they named metallophosphoesterase-1
(MPPE1), from a human brain cDNA library by RT-PCR. Four species of
MPPE1 mRNA were detected. The most abundant form encodes a deduced
396-amino acid protein with a signal sequence, a metallophosphoesterase
domain, and a putative transmembrane domain. One of the alternative
forms encodes a truncated 340-amino acid protein. Northern blot analysis
detected a single 2.2-kb MPPE1 mRNA in brain, but not in any other
tissues tested. The 3 alternative forms were detected in brain by RT-PCR
only.

GENE STRUCTURE

Vuoristo and Ala-Kokko (2001) determined that the MPPE1 gene contains 14
exons and spans about 27 kb. They detected 4 alternatively spliced
forms: the most abundant form contains exons 1, 2, 5-12, and 14, and
another form consists of exons 1, 2, and 5-14; the 2 rare forms
correspond to these 2, but lack the sequences for exon 10.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Vuoristo and Ala-Kokko (2001) mapped the
MPPE1 gene to chromosome 18p11.2. Exons 13, 14 and the 3-prime UTR of
the MPPE1 gene overlap with the 3-prime UTR of the GNAL gene. The 2
genes are oriented in a tail-to-tail manner.

606195	TITLE *606195 IROQUOIS HOMEOBOX PROTEIN 5; IRX5
;;IRXB2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

IRX5 is a member of the Iroquois homeobox gene family. Members of this
family appear to play multiple roles during pattern formation of
vertebrate embryos.

CLONING

Members of the Iroquois complex in Drosophila, including the highly
homologous homeobox genes caupolican, araucan, and mirror, act as
prepattern molecules in neurogenesis. Bosse et al. (1997) identified 3
members of the Iroquois homeobox gene family in mouse and showed that
they are involved in several embryonic developmental processes including
anterior/posterior and dorsal/ventral patterning of specific regions of
the central nervous system, and regionalization of the otic vesicle,
branchial epithelium, and limbs.

By EST database searching, Lewis et al. (1999) identified a human
breast-derived partial cDNA clone containing a novel homeobox. Using
oligonucleotide primers designed to this clone for RACE/PCR, they
obtained the full-length cDNA, which they designated IRX2 but which was
later designated IRX5, as well as fragments of transcripts derived from
4 additional IRX genes. The human IRX homeodomains are about 90%
identical to the homeodomains of the Drosophila Iroquois complex
proteins and about 93% identical to each other. Each of the IRX proteins
contains a hexapeptide-like motif. Lewis et al. (1999) found that the
deduced 417-amino acid IRX5 protein also contains acidic and polyproline
regions and an IRO box. Northern blot analysis detected 2 main
transcripts of 2.6 and 3.9 kb, but the larger transcript did not appear
to contain a closely related homeobox. IRX5 expression is not
breast-specific, as it was found to be weakly expressed in adult human
lung, uterus, salivary gland, and kidney. In situ hybridization
demonstrated that IRX5 is differentially expressed in major mammary
epithelial cell lineages and that its expression is further regulated
during both the proliferative and cyclical phases of human breast
development. IRX5 expression is maintained in human mammary neoplasias.

GENE FUNCTION

Through in vivo modeling in Xenopus laevis embryos, Bonnard et al.
(2012) demonstrated that Irx5 modulates the migration of progenitor cell
populations in branchial arches and gonads by repressing Sdf1 (CXCL12;
600835). They also found that transcriptional control by Irx5 is
modulated by direct protein-protein interaction with GATA3 (131320) and
TRPS1 (604386). Bonnard et al. (2012) suggested that IRX proteins
integrate combinatorial transcriptional inputs to regulate key signaling
molecules involved in the ontogeny of multiple organs during
embryogenesis and homeostasis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 5 affected individuals from 2 consanguineous families with an
autosomal recessive craniofacial syndrome mapping to chromosome
16q12.2-q21 (611174), Bonnard et al. (2012) screened 73 candidate genes
and identified 2 homozygous missense mutations in the IRX5 gene
(606195.0001 and 606195.0002) that segregated with disease in each
family. Irx5 knockdown by morpholino injection in X. laevis embryos
recapitulated the blood, heart, germ cell, and craniofacial anomalies
seen in patients with IRX5 mutations. In addition, Bonnard et al. (2012)
found that IRX5 has direct protein-protein interactions with GATA3 and
TRPS1, and noted that disruption of the latter proteins causes syndromes
with overlapping features (see hypoparathyroidism, sensorineural
deafness, and renal disease, 131320, and trichorhinophalangeal syndrome,
190350, respectively).

MAPPING

By screening of a human genomic library with chicken IRX2 cDNA and EST
database searching, Ogura et al. (2001) cloned 4 human IRX genes. By
fluorescence in situ hybridization, they mapped the IRX5 and IRX7
(606196) genes to chromosome 16q11.2-q13 and the IRX1 (606197) and IRX2
(606198) genes to chromosome 5p15.3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Costantini et al. (2005) found that homozygous Ire5-knockout mice were
viable and fertile but had a defect in the differentiation of retinal
cone bipolar cells and were slightly smaller than wildtype.
Electrocardiograms revealed a significantly decreased signal amplitude
during ventricular repolarization. Lack of the cardiac repolarization
gradient was due to increased Kv4.2 (KCND2; 605410) in endocardial
myocardium, resulting in a selective increase of the transient outward
current, which is the major cardiac repolarization current, and in an
increased susceptibility to arrhythmias. Myocardial Irx5 was expressed
in a gradient opposite that of Kcnd2, and Irx5 repressed Kcnd2
expression by recruiting Bop (SMYD1; 606846), a cardiac transcriptional
repressor. Costantini et al. (2005) concluded that an IRX5 repressor
gradient negatively regulates potassium channel gene expression in the
heart and ensures coordinated cardiac repolarization.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HAMAMY SYNDROME
IRX5, ASN166LYS

In 3 sibs from a consanguineous Jordanian family, originally described
by Hamamy et al. (2007), with severe hypertelorism, midface prominence,
myopia, mental retardation, and bone fragility (611174), Bonnard et al.
(2012) identified homozygosity for a 498C-A transversion in the IRX5
gene, resulting in an asn166-to-lys (N166K) substitution at a
phylogenetically invariant residue in the third helix of the
homeodomain. Functional analysis demonstrated altered protein stability
and DNA binding activity, suggesting that the N166K mutation may act as
a hypomorphic rather than null allele.

.0002
HAMAMY SYNDROME
IRX5, ALA150PRO

In 2 brothers from a consanguineous Turkish family with severe
hypertelorism, midface prominence, myopia, mental retardation, and bone
fragility (611174), Bonnard et al. (2012) identified homozygosity for a
448G-C transition in the IRX5 gene, resulting in an ala150-to-pro
(A150P) substitution at a phylogenetically invariant residue in the
second helix of the homeodomain. The mutation segregated with disease in
the family. X. laevis embryos with Irx5 knockdown showed defective
cranial neural crest cell migration that could be rescued with wildtype
mouse Irx5 DNA but not A150P Irx5 DNA. The A150P variant was also
unstable in X. laevis embryos compared to wildtype or N166K
(606195.0001); Bonnard et al. (2012) suggested that the A150P mutation
may act as a hypomorphic rather than null allele.

600521	TITLE *600521 MANNAN-BINDING LECTIN SERINE PROTEASE 1; MASP1
;;MASP;;
COMPLEMENT-ACTIVATING COMPONENT OF Ra-REACTIVE FACTOR; CRARF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The Ra-reactive factor (RARF) is a complement-dependent bactericidal
factor that binds to the Ra and R2 polysaccharides expressed by certain
enterobacteria. RARF activity is found in the sera of a diverse group of
vertebrates, suggesting that it is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism
to resist infection by these bacterial strains. RARF includes a 100-kD
component, CRARF, also called MASP1 or p100, that was thought to
activate the complement components C4 (C4F, 120820; C4S, 120810), C2
(613927), and C3 (120700). Subsequent work, however, separated MASP1
from MASP2 (605102) and showed that MASP1 activates C3 and C2, whereas
MASP2 activates C4 and C2. The other component of RARF is mannan-binding
lectin (154545), a plasma protein member of the complement system that
binds to microbial carbohydrates and activates the MASPs. The MASPs then
recruit C4 and C2 to generate the C3 convertase or directly activate C3.

CLONING

Takada et al. (1993) cloned a partial human CRARF cDNA from a liver
library. The human CRARF amino acid sequence is similar to the human
complement subcomponents C1R (613785) and C1S (120580). Takada et al.
(1995) obtained a corresponding mouse cDNA.

By RT-PCR with primers based on N-terminal peptide sequence analysis and
the consensus sequence of serine proteases, followed by screening a
fetal liver cDNA library, Sato et al. (1994) isolated a cDNA encoding
MASP. Sequence analysis predicted that the 699-amino acid protein
contains a leader peptide; 2 structural domains similar to those of C1R
and C1S; an EGF-like domain thought to be related to calcium-binding
activity; 2 short consensus repeat domains; and a serine protease
domain. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of 4.8- and 3.4-kb
MASP transcripts in fetal liver; no expression was detected in adult
tissues or in fetal heart, brain, lung, or kidney. Sato et al. (1994)
proposed that the MBL-MASP complex is a novel activator of complement in
what they designated the lectin pathway.

By biochemical purification of plasma proteins and immunoblot analysis,
Dahl et al. (2001) detected a 42-kD serine protease associated with MBL.
They identified a cDNA encoding this protein, MASP3, which is generated
by alternative splicing of MASP1. The MASP3 transcription product is
composed of an A chain, which is common to both MASP1 and MASP3, and a B
chain, which is unique to MASP3. The deduced 728-amino acid MASP3
protein has a signal peptide, 3 N-glycosylation sites on the B chain and
4 on the A chain.

Sirmaci et al. (2010) stated that the MASP1 gene encodes 3 isoforms; 2
isoforms (MASP1 and MASP3) contain different serine protease domains,
and the third (MAp44) lacks a serine protease domain.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Dobo et al. (2009) determined the crystal structure of the catalytic
region of MASP1 and refined it to 2.55-angstrom resolution. The
structure contains a salt bridge and a long 60-loop. The width of the
substrate-binding groove of MASP1 resembles trypsin (see 276000) rather
than early complement proteases.

GENE STRUCTURE

By analysis of genomic clones, Endo et al. (1996) found that the MASP1
catalytic domain is encoded by 6 exons. They proposed that the MASP1
gene is a prototype and that the intron-lacking sequences of C1S and C1R
have a more recent history.

Takayama et al. (1999) determined that the MASP1 gene spans over 67 kb.
It contains 10 exons encoding the nonprotease region of the protein, as
in the case of C1R and C1S, and 6 exons encoding the serine protease
region, in contrast to C1R and C1S, in which this region is encoded by a
single exon.

By PCR with degenerate primers and by genomic sequence analysis, Dahl et
al. (2001) determined that the unique MASP3 B chain is encoded by a
single exon followed by a poly-A region between the 10 exons encoding
the MASP1 A chain and the 6 exons encoding the MASP1 B chain.

MAPPING

Sato et al. (1994) mapped the MASP1 gene to 3q27-q28 by FISH. Using
FISH, Takada et al. (1995) mapped the human CRARF gene to 3q27-q28 and
the mouse gene to 16B2-B3, regions thought to share homology of synteny.

GENE FUNCTION

Matsushita et al. (2000) determined that MASP1 cleaves C3 and C2, while
MASP2 cleaves C4 and C2 to generate the C3 convertase, C4BC2B. Both
could be blocked by the C1 inhibitor (606860).

Rooryck et al. (2011) examined the effects of masp1 knockdown in
zebrafish and observed pigment and craniofacial cartilage defects
similar to those in colec11 (612502) morphants. Testing for epistasis by
injection of suboptimal doses (below which no phenotype is seen when
injected alone) of both colec11 and masp1 morpholinos into
single-cell-stage zebrafish embryos showed that approximately 73%
developed severe craniofacial abnormalities and some developed clefts in
the ethmoid plate. These results suggested that the COLEC11 and MASP1
gene products function in the same pathway.

Degn et al. (2012) found that the alternative complement pathway
functioned normally in a patient with 3MC syndrome (257290) and a
trp290-to-ter (W290X; 600521.0005) mutation in the MASP1 gene, causing
loss of the MASP1, MASP3, and MAp44 isoforms. Conversely, the patient
had a nonfunctional lectin pathway that could be restored by MASP1. Degn
et al. (2012) showed that MASP1 dramatically increased lectin pathway
activity through direct activation of MASP2. Both MASP1 and MASP2 could
associate in the same MBL complex, and this complex was present in human
serum. Degn et al. (2012) concluded that MASP1 and MASP2 act in a manner
analogous to C1R and C1S of the classical complement pathway.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 2 Turkish families segregating 3MC syndrome
mapping to chromosome 3q27 (3MC1; 257920), Sirmaci et al. (2010)
performed whole genome sequencing of candidate genes and identified
homozygosity for a missense and a nonsense mutation in the MASP1 gene
(600521.0004-600521.0005, respectively).

In 2 families with 3MC syndrome mapping to chromosome 3q27, Rooryck et
al. (2011) analyzed candidate genes and identified 2 homozygous missense
mutations in the MASP1 gene (600521.0001 and 600521.0002, respectively).
Analysis of the MASP1 gene in 2 additional Brazilian 3MC families
revealed homozygosity for a third missense mutation in affected
individuals (600521.0003). The mutations all occurred at well-conserved
residues in exon 12 of the gene, segregated with the disorder in each
family, and were not found in at least 506 ethnically matched control
chromosomes.

MASP1, GLY666GLU

In 3 affected individuals from 2 Brazilian families with 3MC syndrome,
(3MC1; 257920), previously reported by Leal and Baptista (2007) and Leal
et al. (2008), respectively, Rooryck et al. (2011) identified
homozygosity for a 1997G-A transition in exon 12 of the MASP1 gene,
resulting in a gly666-to-glu (G666E) substitution at a highly conserved
residue. The mutated alleles segregated with the disorder in both
families and the mutation was not found in 506 North European control
chromosomes.

.0004
3MC SYNDROME 1
MASP1, GLY687ARG

In 2 Turkish sisters with 3MC1 syndrome (257920), the offspring of
first-cousin parents, Sirmaci et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for
a 2059G-A transition in the MASP1 gene, resulting in a gly687-to-arg
(G687R) substitution. The mutation occurred in an exon unique to the
MASP3 isoform. Both parents and an unaffected sib were heterozygous for
the mutation, which was not found in 2 healthy sibs or in 192 healthy
Turkish controls or 1,200 controls of various other ancestries.

.0005
3MC SYNDROME 1
MASP1, TRP290TER

In a 9-year-old Turkish female with 3MC1 syndrome (257920), the
offspring of first-cousin parents, Sirmaci et al. (2010) identified
homozygosity for an 870G-A transition in the MASP1 gene, resulting in a
trp290-to-ter (W290X) substitution. The mutation occurred in coding exon
6, which is shared by all MASP1 isoforms. The mother and an unaffected
sister were heterozygous for the mutation, which was not detected in 192
healthy Turkish controls or 1,200 controls of various other ancestries.

Degn et al. (2012) confirmed that the 9-year-old Turkish girl with 3MC
syndrome and the W290X mutation lacked the MASP1, MASP3, and MAp44
isoforms encoded by the MASP1 gene. They found that the alternative
complement pathway functioned normally in the patient and was unaffected
by reconstitution of serum with MASP1 and MASP3. Conversely, the patient
had a nonfunctional lectin pathway that could be restored by MASP1.

604441	TITLE *604441 CELL DEATH-INDUCING DFFA-LIKE EFFECTOR B; CIDEB
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Inohara et al. (1998) reported the identification and characterization
of 2 mammalian genes, which they called CIDEA (604440) and CIDEB (cell
death-inducing DFFA-like effectors A and B), encoding highly related
proteins with homology to the N-terminal region of DFF45 (601882), a
subunit of the DNA fragmentation factor (DFF) that is cleaved by
caspase-3 (600636) during apoptosis. CIDEA and CIDEB were found to
activate apoptosis in mammalian cells, and this was inhibited by DFF45
but not by caspase inhibitors. Expression of CIDEA induced DNA
fragmentation in 293T cells, and this was also inhibited by DFF45,
further suggesting that DFF45 inhibits the apoptotic activities of
CIDEs. In addition to mammalian CIDEA and CIDEB, Inohara et al. (1998)
identified DREP1, a Drosophila homolog of DFF45 that could inhibit
CIDEA-mediated apoptosis. Mutant analysis revealed that the C-terminal
region of CIDEA was necessary and sufficient for killing, whereas the
region with homology to DFF45 located in the N terminus was required for
DFF45 to inhibit CIDEA-induced apoptosis. CD95/Fas (134637)-mediated
apoptosis was enhanced by CIDEs but inhibited by DFF45. These studies
suggested that DFF45 is evolutionarily conserved and implicated CIDEs as
DFF45-inhibitable effectors that promote cell death and DNA
fragmentation.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Lugovskoy et al. (1999) reported the solution structure of the
N-terminal conserved domain (CIDE-N) of human CIDEB. They showed that
the CIDE-N domain of CIDEB interacts with the CIDE-N domains of both
DFF40 (601883) and DFF45. The binding epitopes were similar and mapped
to a highly charged bipolar surface region of CIDEB. Furthermore,
Lugovskoy et al. (1999) demonstrated that the CIDE-N domain of CIDEB
regulates enzymatic activity of the DFF40/DFF45 complex in vitro.

613170	TITLE *613170 TETRASPANIN 1; TSPAN1
;;NEW EST TETRASPAN 1; NET1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TSPAN1 belongs to the large family of tetraspanins, so named because
they contain 4 transmembrane domains. Tetraspanins are frequently
expressed at the cell surface in association with each other and with
other molecules, such as integrins (see ITGB1; 135630), and they
function to regulate cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and
differentiation (summary by Todd et al., 1998).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences containing a tetraspanin
consensus sequence, Todd et al. (1998) identified human TSPAN1. The
deduced 242-amino acid protein contains 4 transmembrane domains and
other features characteristic of tetraspanins, including conservation of
charged residues in or near the transmembrane domains, similar to ion
channels, and of 4 cysteines in the second extracellular domain. EST
database analysis suggested that TSPAN2 is expressed in colon,
endometrium, pancreas, normal and neoplastic prostate, and pregnant
uterus.

Serru et al. (2000) independently identified TSPAN1, which they called
NET1. The predicted protein contains 241 amino acids. RT-PCR of a cell
line panel detected NET1 expression only in epithelial carcinoma cell
lines.

MAPPING

Serru et al. (2000) stated that the TSPAN1 gene maps to chromosome 1,
between markers D1S2843 and D1S417.

610433	TITLE *610433 LYMPHOCYTE ANTIGEN 6 COMPLEX, LOCUS G5B; LY6G5B
;;G5B
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

LY6G5B belongs to a cluster of leukocyte antigen-6 (LY6) genes located
in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class III region on
chromosome 6. Members of the LY6 superfamily typically contain 70 to 80
amino acids, including 8 to 10 cysteines. Most LY6 proteins are attached
to the cell surface by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor that
is directly involved in signal transduction (Mallya et al., 2002).

CLONING

By EST database searching and RT-PCR analysis, Mallya et al. (2002)
obtained a full-length LY6G5B cDNA. The predicted protein contains an
N-terminal signal peptide, followed by a cys-rich LY6 domain and a
C-terminal hydrophobic region. RT-PCR detected a 606-bp product in
numerous hematopoietic cell lines and in fetal brain and adult lung.
Faint expression was detected in fetal liver and kidney.

GENE STRUCTURE

Mallya et al. (2002) determined that the LY6G5B gene contains 3 exons
and spans about 1.3 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Mallya et al. (2002) mapped the LY6G5B
gene to a LY6 gene cluster within the MHC class III region on chromosome
6p21.3.

;;PTP-ALPHA; PTPA;;
RPTPase-ALPHA;;
LCA-RELATED PHOSPHATASE; LRP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Vital cellular functions, such as cell proliferation and signal
transduction, are regulated in part by the balance between the
activities of protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs; see 147795) and
protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases; EC 3.1.3.48). PTPases can be
divided into 2 classes: small, soluble enzymes containing a single
conserved PTPase domain, such as T-cell protein-tyrosine phosphatase
(PTPT; 176887), and larger, more complex receptor-linked PTPases
containing 2 tandem PTPase domains. PTPRA belongs to the latter group,
which also includes leukocyte common antigen (LCA, or PTPRC; 151460) and
leukocyte antigen-related tyrosine phosphatase (LAR, or PTPRF; 179590)
(summary by Kaplan et al. (1990)).

CLONING

By screening a hepatoblastoma cell line cDNA library with probes
corresponding to the PTPase domains of mouse Ptprc, Jirik et al. (1990)
cloned human PTPRA, which they called LRP. The predicted 793-amino acid
protein has a calculated molecular mass of 87.5 kD (unglycosylated). The
protein contains a leader peptide, followed by a 121-residue
extracellular domain, a single transmembrane segment, and 2 tandem
intracytoplasmic catalytic domains. The extracellular region has 8
potential N-glycosylation sites and multiple O-glycosylation sites.
Northern blot analysis detected 2 LRP transcripts of 3.0 to 3.5 kb in
all human cell cell lines examined. Ubiquitous expression was also
detected in mouse tissues and cell lines.

By screening a human placenta cDNA library with Drosophila Ptp, Krueger
et al. (1990) cloned several PTPases, including PTPRA, which they called
PTP-alpha. The deduced 793-amino acid protein has an N-terminal signal
peptide, followed by an extracellular domain, a transmembrane segment,
and a cytoplasmic region containing duplicate PTPase-like domains.
PTP-alpha is rich in serine and threonine and has multiple potential
N-glycosylation sites.

By screening a human brainstem cDNA library with a leukocyte common
antigen (LCA, or PTPRC; 151460) probe, Kaplan et al. (1990) cloned
PTPRA, which they called RPTPase-alpha. The deduced protein contains 802
amino acids. Outside of the extracellular domain, where some variability
exists, human PTPRA differs from mouse Ptpra at only 5 amino acids.
Northern blot analysis detected 4.3- and 6.3-kb transcripts in various
human cell lines and tissues, with the larger transcript being more
prevalent in fetal tissues.

Matthews et al. (1990) cloned mouse Ptpra, which they called Lrp. The
deduced 793-amino acid protein has an N-terminal leader sequence,
followed by an extracellular domain, a membrane-spanning region, and a
cytoplasmic domain with 2 conserved tyrosine phosphatase catalytic
domains. The extracellular region was predicted to be highly
glycosylated. Matthews et al. (1990) also identified an Lrp splice
variant containing an insertion that preserves the reading frame but
disrupts the first tyrosine phosphatase domain. RNA transfer blot
analysis detected wide expression of Lrp in mouse tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Using the cytoplasmic segment of human PTP-alpha expressed in E. coli,
Krueger et al. (1990) confirmed that PTP-alpha had robust PTPase
activity against phosphorylated test substrates.

MAPPING

By study of rodent-human somatic cell hybrids, Jirik et al. (1990)
mapped the PTPRA gene to chromosome 20p13. Other family members located
on chromosome 20 include SRC (190090), HCK (142370), and PTP1B (176885).
Kaplan et al. (1990) localized the PTPRA gene to chromosome 20pter-20q12
by analysis of its segregation pattern in rodent-human somatic cell
hybrids. Rao et al. (1992) regionalized the assignment of PTPA to the
distal portion of chromosome 20p (20pter-p12) by both radioactive and
fluorescence in situ hybridization. By in situ hybridization, Jirik et
al. (1992) localized the PTPA gene to chromosome 20p13.

Schnittger et al. (1992) mapped the mouse Ptpra gene to chromosome 2,
confirming the exceptional homology between human chromosome 20 and the
distal segment of mouse chromosome 2.

611614	TITLE *611614 UTP3, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; UTP3
;;CHARGED AMINO ACID-RICH LEUCINE ZIPPER 1; CRL1; CRLZ1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Sakuma et al. (2001) cloned mouse Utp3, which they called Crl1. The
deduced 469-amino acid protein is rich in charged amino acids and
contains a putative leucine zipper region and a region that shares
significant homology with yeast Sas10. In situ hybridization revealed
expression in olfactory bulb and cerebral cortex in mouse embryos at
17.5 days postcoitum. Postnatally, Crl1 expression was also observed in
cerebellar cortex, with strong expression in hippocampus.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Sakuma et al. (2001) showed that mouse Crl1
interacted specifically with Pebp2b2, which is encoded by a splice
variant of Pebp2b (CBFB; 121360).

Lim et al. (2006) showed that the CRLZ1 and IgJ (147790) genes are
adjacent but divergently transcribed in human and mouse. By chromatin
immunoprecipitation and FACS analysis of sorted mouse pre-B cells and
plasma cells, they found that IgJ was expressed in the plasma cell
stage, whereas Crlz1 was expressed in the pre-B cell stage. The
stage-specific expression of IgJ and Crlz1 was regulated by chromatin
accessibility and acetylation. DNase I hypersensitive site 1 on the IgJ
promoter was opened in plasma cells, but hypersensitive sites 9 and 10
on the Crlz1 promoter were opened in pre-B cells. H3 (see 602810) and H4
(see 602822) histones were hyperacetylated in the chromatin of Crlz1 in
pre-B cells, whereas those in the chromatin of IgJ were hyperacetylated
in plasma cells. Lim et al. (2006) concluded that the CRLZ1-IgJ locus
shows stage-specific gene expression regulation, and they proposed that
additional regulatory elements may exist between the genes to coordinate
chromatin accessibility and histone acetylation over the locus.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Lim et al. (2006) mapped the UTP3 gene
upstream of the IGJ gene on chromosome 4q21. The UTP3 and IGJ genes are
transcribed in opposite directions, and the positioning and orientation
of the genes are conserved on mouse chromosome 5.

600293	TITLE *600293 ADENYLATE CYCLASE 5; ADCY5
;;ADENYLYL CYCLASE 5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ADCY5 belongs to the adenylate cyclase (EC 4.6.1.1) family of enzymes
responsible for the synthesis of cAMP (Ludwig and Seuwen, 2002).

CLONING

By database analysis and PCR of a human cDNA library, Ludwig and Seuwen
(2002) cloned full-length ADCY5. EST database analysis revealed 2
alternative polyadenylation sites. The deduced protein contains 1,261
amino acids. Semiquantitative RT-PCR detected high expression of ADCY5
in heart and testis, moderate expression in brain, prostate, ovary,
small intestine, and colon, and low expression in lung and liver.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ludwig and Seuwen (2002) determined that the ADCY5 gene contains 21
exons and spans 167 kb. The first exon is 95 kb upstream of the
clustered next 20 exons.

MAPPING

By Southern blot analysis of somatic cell hybrid DNAs, Gaudin et al.
(1994) mapped the ADCY5 gene to chromosome 3. Using isotopic in situ
hybridization, Haber et al. (1994) mapped the ADCY5 gene to 3q13.2-q21.
By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Edelhoff et al. (1995) mapped the
ADCY5 gene to human chromosome 3q13 and to mouse chromosome 16 in the B5
region. In both species, the gene maps close to GAP43 (162060).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Familial Dyskinesia With Facial Myokymia

In affected members of a large German family with autosomal dominant
familial dyskinesia with facial myokymia (FDFM; 606703), Chen et al.
(2012) identified a heterozygous mutation in the ADCY5 gene (A726T;
600293.0001).

- Other Disease Associations

For a discussion of a possible association between variation in the
ADCY5 gene and fasting plasma glucose, birth weight, and 2-hour plasma
glucose levels as quantitative traits, see 613460.

ANIMAL MODEL

Kim et al. (2006) found that Adcy5-null mice had decreased behavioral
responses to morphine, including locomotor activation, analgesia,
tolerance, reward, physical dependence, and withdrawal symptoms,
compared to wildtype mice. Adcy5-null mice also showed attenuated
responses to selective mu (600018) and delta (165195) opioid receptor
agonists, whereas responses to kappa (165196) opioid receptor agonists
were similar to wildtype mice. The results indicated that ADCY5 is an
important component of mu- and delta-opioid receptor signal transduction
mechanisms in the striatum and provided further support for the
importance of the cAMP pathway as a mediator of opioid action.

In affected members of a large German family with autosomal dominant

heterozygous 2176G-A transition in exon 10 of the ADCY5 gene, resulting
in an ala726-to-thr (A726T) substitution at a highly conserved residue
between the first intracellular cyclase homology domain and the second
membrane-spanning domain. The mutation was identified by exome
sequencing of 1 affected individual and was not found in 3,510 control
exomes. Chen et al. (2012) noted that Adcy5-null mice develop a movement
disorder that is worsened by stress, supporting the pathogenicity of the
A726T mutation.

611906	TITLE *611906 FIBRONECTIN TYPE III DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 5; FNDC5
;;FRCP2
IRISIN, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database searching with the sequence of mouse Fndc4 (611905) as
query, Teufel et al. (2002) identified mouse Fndc5. The deduced
203-amino acid protein, like the Fndc4 protein, contains an N-terminal
signal peptide, a fibronectin type III domain, and a transmembrane
domain. The 2 proteins share 60% identity in the FNIII domain and 86% in
the transmembrane domain. Also by database analysis, Teufel et al.
(2002) identified human FNDC5, which shares over 95% amino acid homology
with mouse Fndc5. They found no homologs in invertebrates. Northern blot
analysis of multiple mouse tissues detected highest expression of Fndc5
in adult brain and heart, and low expression in lung, skeletal muscle,
and testis. Northern blot analysis of mouse embryonic mRNA first
detected Fndc5 expression at embryonic day 11, with strongest expression
at E15 and decreasing expression at E17. In situ hybridization
demonstrated expression of Fndc5 in the fore- and midbrain, as well as
in the brachial arches and the heart. Overexpression of a GFP-Fndc5
fusion protein in COS cells showed localization predominantly in the
endoplasmic reticulum, with small amounts in the plasma membrane.

GENE STRUCTURE

Irisin is a 22-kD cleaved fragment that comprises most of the
fibronectin-3 domain of FNDC5 and is comprised of 110 amino acids
(Bostrom et al., 2012). Mouse and human irisin are 100% identical.

GENE FUNCTION

In mouse, Bostrom et al. (2012) demonstrated that PGC1-alpha (604517)
expression in muscle stimulates an increase in expression of FNDC5, a
membrane protein that is cleaved and secreted as a novel hormone,
irisin. Irisin acts on white adipose cells in culture and in vivo to
stimulate UCP1 (113730) expression and a broad program of brown fat-like
development. Irisin is induced with exercise in mice and humans, and
mildly increased irisin levels in the blood cause an increase in energy
expenditure in mice with no changes in movement or food intake. This
results in improvements in obesity and glucose homeostasis. Bostrom et
al. (2012) postulated that irisin could be therapeutic for human
metabolic disease and other disorders that are improved with exercise.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the FNDC5
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP SHGC-74545). Teufel et al. (2002) mapped the
mouse Fndc5 gene to chromosome 4.

610809	TITLE *610809 TBC1 DOMAIN FAMILY, MEMBER 3F; TBC1D3F
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By genomic sequence analysis, Hodzic et al. (2006) identified 8 paralogs
of the TBC1D3 gene (see 607741) on chromosome 17, including TBC1D3F,
which they called paralog E. All TBC1D3 paralogs encode a deduced
549-amino acid protein, but missense changes at 6 residues among the
paralogs result in 5 different TBC1D3 isoforms. The TBC1D3F and TBC1D3E
(610808) genes encode identical proteins. The TBC1D3 paralogs appeared
to be differentially expressed in human tissues.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Hodzic et al. (2006) identified 8 TBC1D3
paralogs, including the TBC1D3E gene, on chromosome 17q12. The paralogs
are clustered in 2 groups of 4 genes, and each cluster spans
approximately 400 kb.

601094	TITLE *601094 FORKHEAD BOX E3; FOXE3
;;FORKHEAD, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG-LIKE 12; FKHL12;;
FORKHEAD-RELATED ACTIVATOR 8; FREAC8
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The forkhead genes are transcription factors distinguished by a
characteristic 100-amino acid motif that was originally identified in
Drosophila; see 164874. Larsson et al. (1995) cloned a partial human
cDNA corresponding to a novel forkhead gene, designated FOXE3. Blixt et
al. (2000) isolated genomic clones of the mouse homolog, Foxe3, which
encodes a 288-amino acid protein. By in situ hybridization, they
detected Foxe3 expression in developing eye around embryonic day 9.5 at
the start of lens placode induction. Expression increased as the lens
placode was formed and was confined to the lens vesicle as it detached
from the surface ectoderm. As the posterior cells of the lens fiber
began to differentiate, expression was restricted to the
undifferentiated cells covering the anterior surface of the lens. Other
than lens, Blixt et al. (2000) detected Foxe3 expression only briefly in
the neural folds in the cephalic region at about the same time as
expression in the lateral head ectoderm. After closure of the anterior
neuropore, expression was found in the most caudal, dorsolateral parts
of the diencephalon. The expression peaked around embryonic days 9.5 to
10 and then disappeared.

Using RT-PCR, Wada et al. (2011) detected Foxe3 expression in adult
mouse testis and eye, but not in brain or kidney.

GENE STRUCTURE

The FOXE gene consists of a single coding exon (Valleix et al., 2006).

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization and somatic cell hybrid analysis,
Larsson et al. (1995) mapped the human FOXE3 gene to 1p32. By FISH,
Blixt et al. (2000) mapped the mouse Foxe3 gene to chromosome 4C7, which
is in agreement with the genetic mapping of the 'dysgenetic lens' (dyl)
mutant to chromosome 4, in an area showing conserved synteny with human
1p32.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Anterior Segment Mesenchymal Dysgenesis

Blixt et al. (2000) proposed human FOXE3 as a candidate for some cases
of Peters anomaly (604229).

Dysgenesis of the anterior segment of the eye is frequently associated
with cataracts and glaucoma, resulting in visual disability in
childhood. Semina et al. (2001) reported a single-nucleotide insertion
in the coding region of the FOXE3 gene in a family with anterior segment
ocular dysgenesis and cataracts (107250). The mutation caused a
frameshift that resulted in an abnormal sequence of 5 terminal amino
acids and an addition of 111 amino acids to the predicted protein. The
mutation was present in 2 affected individuals from this family and was
not identified in 180 normal control chromosomes.

In a large 4-generation Newfoundland family segregating an autosomal
dominant form of variable anterior segment dysgenesis, previously
reported by Green and Johnson (1986), Doucette et al. (2011) analyzed 9
functional candidate genes and identified a heterozygous non-stop
mutation in the FOXE3 gene (X320L; 601094.0003) that segregated with
disease in the family and was not found in 141 ethnically matched
controls.

- Congenital Primary Aphakia

Valleix et al. (2006) detected homozygosity for a nonsense mutation in
the FOXE3 gene (601094.0002) in 3 sibs with congenital primary aphakia
(610256). The authors stated that the findings indicated a possible
critical role for FOXE3 very early in the lens developmental program,
perhaps earlier than any role recognized elsewhere for this gene.

ANIMAL MODEL

Blixt et al. (2000) hypothesized that mutations in Foxe3 could be
responsible for the phenotype observed in dysgenetic lens (dyl) mutant
mice. In these mice, the lens vesicle fails to separate from the
ectoderm, causing a fusion between the lens and the cornea. Blixt et al.
(2000) identified 2 mutations within the DNA-binding domain of Foxe3 in
dyl mice: phe93-to-leu and phe98-to-ser. These 2 phenylalanine residues
are highly conserved in all forkhead proteins and Blixt et al. (2000)
predicted the mutations would obliterate DNA binding.

Blixt et al. (2000) reported that in dyl mice, the posterior of the lens
epithelium fails to divide and shows signs of premature differentiation,
whereas the most anterior cells are eliminated by apoptosis. The normal
separation of the lens vesicle from the ectoderm fails in dyl mice.
However, lens fiber differentiation appears to be normal and is thought
to be independent of Foxe3. Blixt et al. (2000) concluded that Foxe3 is
essential for closure of the lens vesicle and is a factor that promotes
survival and proliferation, while preventing differentiation, in the
lens epithelium.

In the vacuolated lens (vl) mouse model resulting from a deletion in the
mouse Gpr161 gene (612250), Matteson et al. (2008) mapped modifier
quantitative trait loci and found the pro23 allele of Foxe3, which
reduced the transcriptional activity of Foxe3, contributed to cataract
development in vl/vl mice.

The Rinshoken cataract (rct) mutation is a recessive mutation in mice
that causes mild microphthalmia and congenital cataracts with severe
degeneration of lens fibers. Wada et al. (2011) determined that rct is
caused by a 22-bp deletion within an upstream regulatory region of the
Foxe3 gene that contains major and minor lens regulatory elements. The
deletion includes a CTCTTTTCA motif that is highly conserved in
vertebrates. RT-PCR detected reduced expression of Foxe3 in lens, but
not testis, of rct mice compared with wildtype. Wada et al. (2011)
concluded that rct is caused by reduced Foxe3 expression due to a
deletion in a cis-acting regulatory element.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ANTERIOR SEGMENT MESENCHYMAL DYSGENESIS
FOXE3, 1-BP INS, 943G

In a mother and daughter with anterior segment mesenchymal dysgenesis
(107250), Semina et al. (2001) identified a single G nucleotide
insertion 15 bp upstream of the stop codon in the FOXE3 gene. The
mutation resulted in a frameshift which altered the sequence of the last
5 amino acids and added an additional 111 amino acids to the predicted
protein.

.0002
APHAKIA, CONGENITAL PRIMARY
FOXE3, CYS240TER

In 3 sibs from a consanguineous family with congenital primary aphakia
(601094), Valleix et al. (2006) found homozygosity for a C-to-A
transversion at position 720 of the FOXE3 gene that predicted the
substitution of a stop codon for cysteine at codon 240 (C240X). Each
unaffected parent was heterozygous for the mutation.

.0003
ANTERIOR SEGMENT MESENCHYMAL DYSGENESIS
FOXE3, TER320LEU

In 8 affected members of a large 4-generation Newfoundland family with
variable anterior segment dysgenesis (107250), previously reported by
Green and Johnson (1986), Doucette et al. (2011) identified
heterozygosity for a 959G-T transversion in the FOXE3 gene, resulting in
the elimination of the functional opal stop codon (ter320-to-leu; X320L)
and predicting the addition of 72 amino acid residues to the C terminus.
The mutation was not found in 17 unaffected family members or in 141
ethnically matched controls. Direct sequencing of an affected
individual's cDNA demonstrated the absence of the 959G-T mutation,
suggesting that the mRNA transcribed from the 'non-stop' allele might be
degraded before being translated, or that the mRNA might not be
transcribed at all.
