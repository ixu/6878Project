DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Demuth et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA clone, designated pHKB3, encoding a
human erythrocyte surface protein band 3-like gene product. Peptide
mapping shows substantial sequence homology between the erythrocyte band
3 protein (109270) and a band 3-like protein found in leukocytes.
Palumbo et al. (1986) described the partial sequence of a 2.7-kb human
cDNA clone encoding a band 3-related protein in nonerythroid cells.
Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence for this cDNA with the
amino acid sequences of mouse and human erythroid band 3 proteins
confirmed that the human clone is related to but distinct from erythroid
band 3. Palumbo et al. (1986) symbolized the gene as HKB3, in part after
the name of the human cell line studied.

Tanner (1993) referred to this nonerythroid anion exchanger as AE2. The
ability of AE2 to mediate anion transport has been confirmed. Northern
blotting studies showed that the AE2 gene is transcribed in a wide
variety of tissues. In the mouse, Lindsey et al. (1990) found that AE2
is expressed only in choroid plexus, the site of cerebrospinal fluid
production. Kudrycki et al. (1990) found that, in the rat, AE2 is
particularly abundant in the stomach and portions of the
gastrointestinal tract.

GENE STRUCTURE

Medina et al. (1997) determined that the AE2 gene spans approximately 17
kb and consists of 23 exons.

MAPPING

Using somatic cell genetics and in situ hybridization, Palumbo et al.
(1986) mapped the HKB3 gene to 7q35-q36. Showe et al. (1993) identified
an MboI RFLP in the EPB3L1 gene. White et al. (1994) demonstrated that
the murine AE2 gene is located on chromosome 5. This result was obtained
by analysis of recombinant inbred lines and by interspecific backcross
analysis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Medina et al. (2003) disrupted the mouse Ae2 gene in a manner that
prevented the expression of 3 Ae2 isoforms normally found in testis.
Male Ae2 -/- mice, but not female Ae2 -/- mice, were infertile.
Histopathologic analysis of mutant testis showed an interruption in
spermiogenesis, with only a few late spermatids and a complete absence
of spermatozoa in the seminiferous tubules. The number of apoptotic
bodies was increased in the seminiferous tubules and in the epididymis,
which also showed squamous metaplasia of the epididymal epithelium.

602044	TITLE *602044 UNCOUPLING PROTEIN 3; UCP3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Boss et al. (1997) and Vidal-Puig et al. (1997) described the cloning of
UCP3 cDNAs. Both groups derived their clones from human skeletal muscle
libraries, and both reported that UCP3 is approximately 57% and 73%
identical to human UCP1 (113730) and UCP2 (601693), respectively. Boss
et al. (1997) and Solanes et al. (1997) cloned a short isoform of UCP3
(UCP3S) containing 275 amino acids and a long isoform of UCP3 (UCP3L)
containing 312 amino acids. UCP3S contains 3 mitochondrial
energy-transfer-protein domains and 5 putative transmembrane domains,
while UCP3L contains an additional 37 amino acids at its C terminus that
encodes a putative transmembrane domain and a putative purine
nucleotide-binding domain. Solanes et al. (1997) determined that UCP3S
is generated when a cleavage and polyadenylation signal within the last
intron prematurely terminates message elongation. Boss et al. (1997)
used Northern blot analysis to show that in human tissue UCP3 is
expressed as a 2.3-kb message in skeletal muscle and heart. In rat
tissue, UCP3 transcripts were found in heart, brown adipose tissue,
white adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Boss et al. (1997) examined UCP expression in cold-adapted rats and
found that, unlike UCP1, the expression levels of UCP2 and UCP3 were not
affected by cold. Nonetheless, the authors concluded that UCP3 may be
involved in thermogenesis through the uncoupling of oxidative
phosphorylation in skeletal muscle.

Millet et al. (1997) observed an increase in the levels of UCP2 and UCP3
mRNA in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue from both lean and obese
individuals undergoing fasting. They suggested that the increase
indicates a role for these proteins in the metabolic adaptation to
fasting. The similar induction of gene expression observed during
fasting in lean and obese subjects show that there is no major
alteration of UCP2 and UCP3 gene regulation in adipose tissue and
skeletal muscle of obese subjects. UCP2 is widely expressed in human
tissues, whereas UCP3 expression seems to be restricted to skeletal
muscle, an important site of thermogenesis in humans.

With the capacity to participate in thermogenesis and energy balance,
UCP3 is an important obesity candidate gene. Bouchard et al. (1997)
demonstrated linkage between markers at the UCP2/UCP3 region with
resting metabolic rate. This region is syntenic to a region of mouse
chromosome 7 that has been linked to hyperinsulinemia and obesity
(Fleury et al., 1997).

Liu et al. (1998) and Hinz et al. (1999) showed that expression of UCP3
in yeast resulted in reduced cellular growth and a significant decrease
in mitochondria membrane potential. Hinz et al. (1999) found that
cellular respiration coupled to oxidative phosphorylation decreased,
while cellular heat production increased. Liu et al. (1998) found that
adenovirus-mediated leptin (164160) expression in obese ob/ob mice led
to increased expression of Ucp3 in skeletal muscle, as well as
significant weight loss.

UCP1 diverts energy from ATP synthesis to thermogenesis in the
mitochondria of brown adipose by catalyzing a regulated leak of protons
across the inner membrane. UCP2 and UCP3 are present at much lower
abundance than UCP1, and the uncoupling with which they are associated
is not significantly thermogenic. Mild uncoupling would, however,
decrease the mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species, which
are important mediators of oxidative damage. Echtay et al. (2002)
demonstrated that superoxide increases mitochondrial proton conductance
through effects on UCP1, UCP2, and UCP3. Superoxide-induced uncoupling
requires fatty acids and is inhibited by purine nucleotides.
Superoxide-induced uncoupling correlates with the tissue expression of
UCPs and appears in mitochondria from yeast expressing UCP1. Skeletal
muscle mitochondria express only UCP3; therefore superoxide-induced
uncoupling is absent in the skeletal muscle of UCP3 knockout mice.
Echtay et al. (2002) concluded that the interaction of superoxide with
UCPs may be a mechanism for decreasing the concentrations of reactive
oxygen species inside mitochondria.

In 9 healthy male volunteers, Hesselink et al. (2003) measured the
phosphocreatine resynthesis rate following intense anoxic contraction,
which is a sensitive index of in vivo mitochondrial function, after 7
days on a low-fat diet and again after 7 days on a high-fat diet. The
high-fat diet increased UCP3 protein content in muscle by 44% compared
to the low-fat diet, but this increase in UCP3 was not associated with
any changes in the rate of muscle phosphocreatine resynthesis during
conditions of maximal flux through oxidative phosphorylation. Hesselink
et al. (2003) concluded that the primary role of UCP3 in humans is not
uncoupling.

GENE STRUCTURE

Solanes et al. (1997) determined that the UCP3 gene contains 7 exons and
spans about 8.5 kb. The coding sequence uses exons 2 to 7 and spans
about 5.25 kb.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

The observation that UCP3 is increased in situations where fatty acid
entry into the mitochondria may exceed the beta-oxidation capacity
suggested to Russell et al. (2003) that this protein may be involved in
the outward translocation of fatty acid from the mitochondrial matrix.
The authors performed biochemical and molecular tests using muscle from
patients with riboflavin-responsive multiple acylcoenzyme A
dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD; 231680), a lipid storage myopathy
characterized by a decrease in fatty acid beta-oxidation capacity. The
results demonstrated decreases in fatty acid beta-oxidation and in the
activities of respiratory chain complexes I (see 157655) and II (see
600857), associated with increases of 3.1- and 1.7-fold in UCP3 mRNA and
protein expression, respectively. The authors postulated that
upregulation of UCP3 in MADD is due to the accumulation of muscle fatty
acid/acylCoA. The authors considered MADD an optimal model to study the
hypothesis that UCP3 is involved in the outward translocation of an
excess of fatty acid from the mitochondria and to show that, in humans,
the effects of fatty acid on UCP3 expression are direct and independent
of fatty acid beta-oxidation.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis and PCR of P1 and BAC genomic clones,
Solanes et al. (1997) mapped the UCP3 gene to chromosome 11q13, adjacent
to the UCP2 gene. Walder et al. (1998) pointed out that the UCP2 and
UCP3 genes constitute a cluster that maps to 11q13. Boss et al. (1998)
described the genomic structure of the UCP3 gene and mapped the gene to
11q13 by somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid analysis. Pecqueur et
al. (1999) determined that the UCP2 gene is located 7 kb downstream of
the UCP3 gene.

By PCR of mouse P1 and BAC clones, Solanes et al. (1997) mapped the
mouse Ucp3 and Ucp2 genes to chromosome 7.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Argyropoulos et al. (1998) identified a missense polymorphism in exon 3
(V102I; 602044.0001) of the UCP3 gene. A mutation introducing a stop
codon in exon 4 (R143X; 602044.0002) and a terminal polymorphism in the
splice donor junction of exon 6 (602044.0003) were also identified in an
individual who was morbidly obese and diabetic. Allele frequencies of
the exon 3 and exon 6 splice junction polymorphisms were determined and
found to be similar in Gullah-speaking African Americans and the Mende
tribe of Sierra Leone, but absent in Caucasians. Moreover, in exon 6
splice donor heterozygotes, basal fat oxidation rates were reduced by
50%, and the respiratory quotient was markedly increased compared with
wildtype individuals, implicating a role for UCP3 in metabolic fuel
partitioning.

Brown et al. (1999) found that expression of native human UCP3 mutations
in yeast showed complete loss (R70W; 602044.0004), significant reduction
(R143X; 602044.0002), or no effect (V102I; 602044.0001 and +1G-A;
602044.0003) on the uncoupling activity of UCP3. The authors concluded
that certain mutations in UCP3 alter its functional impact on membrane
potential, possibly conferring susceptibility to metabolic diseases.

Dalgaard et al. (2001) tested whether variation of the UCP3 promoter is
associated with either juvenile or maturity-onset obesity or body weight
change over a 26-year follow-up among Danish subjects. Mutation
screening of approximately 1 kb 5-prime upstream of the UCP3 gene
revealed a C-to-T variant at -55 (dbSNP rs1800849). The frequency of
this polymorphism was evaluated by restriction fragment length
polymorphism analysis in 4 groups: 1) a group of 744 obese Danish men
who at the draft board examinations had a BMI of at least 31 kg/m2; 2) a
randomly selected control group consisting of 857 draftees; 3) 258
middle-aged subjects; and 4) 409 sixty-year-old subjects. The frequency
of the T allele was 26.0% among the obese draftees and 26.9% in the
control group. The authors concluded that this variant does not play a
major role in the development of common obesity among Danish subjects.

ANIMAL MODEL

Clapham et al. (2000) created transgenic mice that overexpress human
UCP3 in skeletal muscle. UCP3 expression was driven by the human
alpha-skeletal actin (102610) promoter, limiting expression to skeletal
muscle. Clapham et al. (2000) bred 3 independent lines to homozygosity
and selected a line of mice that had a 66-fold increase in UCP3
expression. These mice were hyperphagic but weighed less than their
wildtype littermates. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a striking
reduction in adipose tissue mass. The mice also exhibited lower fasting
plasma glucose and insulin levels and an increased glucose clearance
rate. Clapham et al. (2000) concluded that their data provided evidence
that skeletal muscle UCP3 has the potential to influence metabolic rates
and glucose homeostasis in the whole animal. Choi et al. (2007) showed
that transgenic mice that overexpress human UCP3 in skeletal muscle were
completely protected against the fat-induced defects and insulin
resistance developed in wildtype mice fed a high-fat diet. Protection
was associated with a lower membrane-to-cytosolic ratio of
diacylglycerol and reduced PKC-theta (600448) activity.

Uncoupling protein-3 is a mitochondrial protein that can diminish the
mitochondrial membrane potential. Levels of muscle UCP3 mRNA are
increased by thyroid hormone and fasting. Gong et al. (2000) produced
Ucp3 knockout mice to test the hypothesis that UCP3 influences metabolic
efficiency and is a candidate obesity gene. The Ucp3 -/- mice had no
detectable immunoreactive UCP3 by Western blot analysis. In mitochondria
from the knockout mice, proton leak was greatly reduced in muscle,
minimally reduced in brown fat, and not reduced at all in liver. These
data suggested that UCP3 accounts for much of the proton leak in
skeletal muscle. Despite the lack of UCP3, no consistent phenotypic
abnormality was observed in the mice. They were not obese and had normal
serum insulin, triglyceride, and leptin levels, with a tendency toward
reduced free fatty acids and glucose. Knockout mice showed a normal
circadian rhythm in body temperature and motor activity and had normal
body temperature responses to fasting, stress, thyroid hormone, and cold
exposure. The baseline metabolic rate and respiratory exchange ratio
were the same in knockout and control mice, as were the effects of
fasting, a beta-3 adrenergic agonist, and thyroid hormone on these
parameters. The phenotype of Ucp1/Ucp3 double knockout mice was
indistinguishable from Ucp1 single knockout mice. The data suggested
that Ucp3 is not a major determinant of metabolic rate but, rather, has
other functions.

In Ucp3 knockout mice, Vidal-Puig et al. (2000) found that skeletal
muscle mitochondria lacking Ucp3 are more coupled (i.e., increased state
3/state 4 ratio), indicating that Ucp3 has uncoupling activity. In
addition, production of reactive oxygen species was increased in
mitochondria lacking Ucp3. Despite these effects on mitochondrial
function, Ucp3 did not seem to be required for body weight regulation,
exercise tolerance, fatty acid oxidation, or cold-induced thermogenesis.

Mills et al. (2003) found that mice deficient in Ucp3 have a diminished
thermogenic response to the drug MDMA, also known as 'ecstasy,' and did
not die from a dose of 40 mg kg(-1), which killed 30% of wildtype
littermates. Although the baseline temperature of Ucp3 -/- mice was
indistinguishable from that of wildtype animals, Ucp3-deficient mice
showed a significantly blunted rise in both skeletal muscle and rectal
temperature following MDMA administration. Mills et al. (2003) concluded
that UCP3 is important in MDMA-induced hyperthermia.

In a Gullah-speaking African American woman with severe obesity (601665)
and type II diabetes (125853), Argyropoulos et al. (1998) found
heterozygosity for a val102-to-ile (V102I) mutation of the UCP3 gene,
located in the first cytosol-oriented extramembranous loop. Three
overweight children in this family were found to be homozygous for the
V102I polymorphism. The fourth child, a 9-year-old male with a body mass
index (BMI) of 18.5, was heterozygous for the V102I polymorphism. No
paternal sample was available but the father was presumed to be at least
heterozygous for the V102I polymorphism. The polymorphism was not found
in genomic DNA from 128 Caucasian Americans. However, examination of 280
African Americans revealed that 4% of individuals were homozygous and
28% heterozygous for the polymorphism. In the Mende tribe in Sierra
Leone, 3% of the population was found to be homozygous A/A and 21%
heterozygous G/A.

UCP3, ARG143TER

In a 16-year-old with morbid obesity (601665) (BMI = 51.8) and type II
diabetes (125853), Argyropoulos et al. (1998) found compound
heterozygosity for a 427C-T transition in exon 4, resulting in the
introduction of a premature stop codon at residue 143, arg143 to ter
(R143X), in the third, matrix-oriented loop. In addition, the patient
was heterozygous for a guanine to adenine polymorphism at the splice
donor site of exon 6 (Ggt-Gat), resulting in loss of the splice junction
and premature termination of the protein product in the sixth,
matrix-oriented loop (602044.0003). A putative protein resulting from
this mutation would be identical to that encoded by the short transcript
of UCP3 mRNA. Pedigree analysis and DNA sequence determination of family
members showed that the R143X mutation was transmitted to the compound
heterozygous proband from the grandmother, through the mother, in
typical mendelian fashion. The heterozygous polymorphism at the exon 6
splice donor junction (Ggt-Gat) was not detected in the maternal lineage
and was most likely transmitted from the father, whose DNA was not
available for analysis, but may have arisen as a new change.
Argyropoulos et al. (1998) examined an additional 168 individuals
comprising both African Americans and Caucasians for the 2 nucleotide
changes. The R143X mutation was not detected in any other individual in
either racial group. The exon 6 splice donor stop mutation, however, was
detected in African-American subjects but not in Caucasians. An
identical allele frequency (G, 90% and A, 10%) was found in
Gullah-speaking African Americans and the Mende tribe. No homozygous
subjects for the polymorphism (a/a) were detected in 287 Gullah-speaking
African Americans and only 3 homozygotes were identified in 192 subjects
of the Mende tribe. Haplotype analysis of 2 polymorphisms, V102I
(602044.0001) and the exon 6 splice donor Ggt-Gat, showed that the 2
genotypes were independent.

UCP3, IVS6, G-A, +1

In a 16-year-old female with morbid obesity (601665), Argyropoulos et
al. (1998) found compound heterozygosity for a polymorphism at the exon
6 splice donor junction (Ggt-Gat) and the R143X mutation (602004.0002).
The rare R143X mutation was inherited in the maternal line; the splice
site polymorphism was presumably transmitted from the father. The g-to-a
transition at the splice donor site of exon 6 resulted in loss of the
splice junction and truncation of the protein product at the first tga
stop codon of the adjacent intron.

Among unrelated individuals, Argyropoulos et al. (1998) found that
heterozygotes for the exon 6 splice donor polymorphism had a 50%
reduction in fat oxidation adjusted for lean body mass and a marked
elevation in the nonprotein respiratory quotient, compared with wildtype
subjects. No significant differences were found between heterozygotes
and wildtype individuals for BMI, percentage of body fat, and resting
energy expenditure adjusted for lean body mass. The same analyses
performed for the V102I polymorphism (602044.0001) showed no significant
differences between heterozygotes and wildtype individuals for any of
the aforementioned quantitative traits. Nonetheless, the African
American population studied had a high prevalence of obesity; therefore,
the possibility that this could mask a potential effect of UCP3
mutations on BMI was also examined. Indeed, Argyropoulos et al. (1998)
found that the frequency of the g/a heterozygous genotype was nearly
twice as high (P = 0.04) in obese (30%) compared with lean (16%)
individuals.

Brown et al. (1999) identified a rare mutation in UCP3, arg70-to-trp, in
a 15-year-old male of Chinese descent with severe obesity (601665) and
type II diabetes (125853). Alignments showed that the mutated valine and
arginine residues in V102I (602044.0001) and R70W are completely
conserved in all known UCPs, including the plant UCP, suggesting that
these residues may play an important functional role. Brown et al.
(1999) expressed native human UCP3 mutations in yeast and showed
complete loss on the uncoupling activity of UCP3 with R70W and no effect
on this activity with V102I.

;;CELL DIVISION CYCLE 2-LIKE 1; CDC2L1;;
PROTEIN KINASE p58; PK58; p58;;
CDC-RELATED PROTEIN KINASE p58;;

CDK11
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Bunnell et al. (1990) identified a human cell division control
(CDC)-related protein kinase, p58, that is structurally and functionally
related to p34(cdc2) (CDC2; 116940). Abnormal expression of the p58
protein kinase in eukaryotic cells had effects suggesting that it is a
negative regulator of normal cell cycle progression. The gene is well
conserved evolutionarily. Its expression is regulated during murine
embryogenesis, and its activity is coordinately regulated with that of
p34(cdc2) during the cell cycle.

Lahti et al. (1994) characterized the genomic region surrounding CDC2L1
and found that a related gene, CDC2L2 (116951), was located within 100
kb. They referred to CDC2L1 as PITSLRE B, based on the amino acid
sequence of the region corresponding to the conserved CDC2 PSTAIRE box.

Xiang et al. (1994) isolated multiple, alternatively spliced CDC2L1 and
CDC2L2 mRNAs. The CDC2L1 transcripts encode protein isoforms ranging in
size from 58 to 110 kD. The isoforms vary in the length and sequence of
their N-terminal regions; the protein kinase catalytic and C-terminal
domains are identical. All contain a 30-residue acid blob domain
comprised primarily of glutamic acid. The larger protein species
contained a putative bipartite nuclear localization signal. Western blot
analysis revealed that the 58-kD isoform was present only in cells
undergoing apoptosis. Xiang et al. (1994) analyzed the expression
pattern of the CDC2L1 mRNAs.

The CDC2L1 and CDC2L2 genes encode almost identical protein kinases of
110 kD that contain at their C termini the open reading frame of a
smaller isoform of 58 kD. Cornelis et al. (2000) found that 2 PITSLRE
protein kinase isoforms, p110 and p58, are translated from a single
transcript by initiation at alternative in-frame AUG codons. p110 is
produced by classic cap-dependent translation, whereas p58 results from
internal initiation of translation controlled by an internal ribosome
entry site (IRES) with unique properties. The IRES element is localized
to the mRNA coding region, and its activity is cell cycle regulated,
permitting translation of p58 in G2/M.

Loyer et al. (2008) stated that both CDC2L2 and CDC2L1 can produce a
third isoform, p46, by caspase-dependent proteolysis of either the p110
or p58 isoforms. By immunofluorescence analysis of several human cell
lines, they detected p110 in both nucleoplasm and nuclear speckles.
Western blot analysis showed robust expression of p110 in several human
cell lines and in activated human peripheral blood cells. Only activated
blood cells expressed p58 and p46. Size exclusion chromatography of HeLa
cells revealed that p110 fractionated with protein complexes of about
170 kD to over 1 MDa.

GENE FUNCTION

Lahti et al. (1994) demonstrated that 1 allele of the entire gene CDC2L
complex was either deleted or translocated in 18 of 20 neuroblastoma
(256700) cell lines investigated. They suggested that the CDC2L gene
complex may harbor 1 or more tumor suppressor genes affected by
chromosome 1p36 modifications in neuroblastoma.

By immunoprecipitation analysis and protein pull-down assays with human
cell lines, Loyer et al. (2008) found that p110 CDK11 associated with
the alpha and beta isoforms of cyclin L1 (CCNL1; 613384) and L2 (CCNL2;
613482) in a high molecular mass complex that showed splicing activity.
The p58 and p46 CDK11 isoforms interacted more weakly with the cyclin L
alpha isoforms. In vivo splicing assays showed that expression of cyclin
L1-alpha, L1-beta, L2-alpha, or L2-beta and/or p110 CDK11 increased
intron-splicing activity and altered alternative splice-site selection
in a cyclin L1 and L2 isoform- and cell type-specific manner. In
contrast with p110 CDK11, p58 and p46 CDK11 reduced splicing activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Eipers et al. (1992) detailed the complete structure of the CDC2L1 gene
including its putative promoter region, transcriptional start sites,
exonic sequences, and intron/exon boundary sequences. The gene is 10 kb
and contains 12 exons and 11 introns.

Gururajan et al. (1998) determined the structure of the 140-kb CDC2L
genomic region. This region consists of 2 identical genomic segments
arranged in a tail-to-tail configuration. Each segment contains a CDC2L
gene linked to an MMP gene. See MMP21 (603320). In each case, the most
widely expressed products of the CDC2L gene are derived from a genomic
region that is composed of 20 exons and spans approximately 20 kb. The
authors reported that only 15 amino acids of the 773-786 residues that
encode the multiple CDC2L isoforms are unique to either CDC2L1 or
CDC2L2.

MAPPING

Eipers et al. (1991) assigned the expressed p58 gene to 1p36 by somatic
cell hybrid analysis, in situ hybridization, and nested PCR
amplification of microdissected chromosomes. The authors stated that
this gene, tentatively symbolized PK58, may be implicated in the
pathogenesis of tumors that have deletion in the region of 1p36.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Lahti et al. (1994) mapped the
CDC2L1 gene to 1p36.3.

White et al. (1995) showed that CDC2L1 is located outside the consensus
region of allelic loss of heterozygosity (LOH) associated with
neuroblastomas, namely, 1p36.3-p36.2, and is therefore not the
neuroblastoma suppressor gene.

615417	TITLE *615417 BET1-LIKE PROTEIN; BET1L
;;GOLGI SNARE, 15-KD; GS15
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

BET1L is part of a SNARE (SNAP receptor) complex that recruits soluble
N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF; 601633) attachment proteins
(SNAPs) to membranes. BET1L is a vesicle-associated SNARE (v-SNARE) that
pairs with a target membrane SNARE (t-SNARE), such as GOS28 (GOSR1;
604026) and syntaxin-5 (STX5; 603189) (Xu et al., 1997; Volchuk et al.,
2004).

CLONING

By searching databases using rat Bet1 (605456) as probe, followed by
screening a rat brain cDNA library, Xu et al. (1997) cloned rat Bet1l,
which they called Gs15. The deduced 111-amino acid protein has a
C-terminal hydrophobic region that may function as a membrane anchor.
Northern blot analysis revealed ubiquitous expression in rat tissues.
Immunoblot analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated
expression of a 15-kD protein on Golgi membranes.

GENE FUNCTION

Xu et al. (1997) showed that rat Gs15 bound to recombinant SNAP. They
concluded that GS15 is a C-terminal tail-anchored integral membrane
v-SNARE associated with the Golgi apparatus.

Using immunoelectron microscopy with mammalian cell lines and tissues,
Xu et al. (2002) showed that Gs15 was primarily found in the medial
cisternae of the Golgi apparatus and adjacent tubulovesicular elements.
Coimmunoprecipitation analysis identified rat Gs15 as part of a distinct
SNARE complex containing 3 other SNAREs, Stx5, Gs28, and Ykt6 (606209),
implicated in both ER-to-Golgi and intra-Golgi transport. Inhibition of
GS15 expression by small interfering RNA in HeLa cells resulted in
redistribution of Golgi markers into small dotty and diffuse labeling.
Xu et al. (2002) proposed that GS15 has an essential role in the Golgi
apparatus.

Using quantitative immunogold labeling in mammalian cells, Volchuk et
al. (2004) showed that the distribution of t-SNAREs was nearly even
across the Golgi stack from the cis to the trans side, whereas Gs15 was
present in a gradient of increasing concentration toward the trans face
of the stack. In contrast, the v- and t-SNARE subunits of a second
distinct SNARE complex required for intra-Golgi transport decreased in
concentration toward the trans face. Volchuk et al. (2004) proposed that
transport within the stack uses countercurrent gradients of 2 Golgi
SNAREpins (i.e., complexes of cognate v- and t-SNAREs bridging 2
membranes) and may involve a homotypic fusion mechanism.

MAPPING

Gross (2013) mapped the BET1L gene to chromosome 11p15.5 based on an
alignment of the BET1L sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF234160) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;ZINC FINGER PROTEIN, SUBFAMILY 1A, MEMBER 1; ZNFN1A1;;
IKAROS; IK1;;
LYF1
IKAROS/BCL6 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Ikaros proteins are lymphoid-restricted zinc finger transcription
factors that are considered master regulators of lymphocyte
differentiation. Klug et al. (1998) noted that there are at least 8
alternatively spliced transcripts of the Ikaros gene that encode
isoforms with common N-terminal and C-terminal domains. By screening a
Jurkat T-cell cDNA library with a mouse Ikaros cDNA, Molnar et al.
(1996) isolated human Ikaros cDNAs. The deduced human and mouse Ikaros
proteins are 95% identical. RT-PCR of human thymus and peripheral blood
leukocyte mRNAs detected 6 Ikaros splicing variants which were expressed
at similar levels and ratios as the corresponding mouse leukocyte Ikaros
transcripts. The authors found that Ikaros proteins are conserved in
sequence composition and relative expression between human T cells and
mouse thymocytes. Northern blot analysis demonstrated the expression of
7.5- and 4.5-kb Ikaros transcripts in human thymus, spleen, and
peripheral blood leukocytes.

By PCR using primers based on a conserved nucleotide sequence of various
zinc finger proteins, Nietfeld and Meyerhans (1996) cloned human bone
marrow cDNAs encoding Ikaros, which they designated IK1. The deduced
519-amino acid protein is 93% identical to the mouse Ikaros isoform
1/LyF1 isoform VI and contains 4 N-terminal and 2 C-terminal zinc finger
domains. The authors detected 3 human mRNA species by Northern blot
analysis: a 4.4-kb transcript, which was prominent in peripheral blood
leukocytes; a 6.0-kb transcript, which was strongly expressed in spleen,
thymus, lymph node, and bone marrow; and a 7.0-kb transcript. They
stated that the human and mouse Ikaros genes have similar overall
transcription patterns.

Dijon et al. (2008) stated that the N-terminal Kruppel-like zinc finger
domain of Ikaros proteins is involved in DNA binding, while the
C-terminal zinc finger domain mediates homo- or heterodimerization with
other Ikaros proteins. Alternative splicing of exons 3 to 6 produces
Ikaros isoforms with 0 to 4 N-terminal zinc fingers, and those with at
least 3 efficiently bind DNA. The DNA-binding Ikaros isoforms include
IK1, IK2, IK3, and IKX, and IK4 can bind DNA on palindromic sequences.
IK5, IK6, IK7, and IK8 are considered dominant-negative isoforms due to
their capacity to bind other isoforms and their inefficiency in binding
DNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Harker et al. (2002) showed that Ikaros may play an important role in
CD4 (186940) versus CD8 (see CD8A; 186910) lineage commitment decisions
by demonstrating: (1) that it binds to regulatory elements in the
endogenous CD8A locus in vivo using thymocyte chromatin
immunoprecipitations; (2) that Ikaros suppresses position effect
variegation of transgenes driven by CD8 regulatory elements; and (3)
that mice with reduced levels of Ikaros and Aiolos (606221) show an
apparent increase in CD4 populations with immature phenotype, i.e.,
cells that fail to activate the CD8A gene. The authors proposed that
Ikaros family members function as activators of the CD8A gene and that
their associated activities are critical for appropriate chromatin
remodeling transitions during thymocyte differentiation and lineage
commitment.

Ezzat et al. (2005) demonstrated that Ikaros is expressed in the
hormone-producing pituitary corticomelanotroph cells of mice, where it
binds the proopiomelanocortin promoter and regulates endogenous gene
expression. Ikaros-null mice had contraction of the pituitary
corticomelanotroph population, reduced circulating adrenocorticotrophic
hormone levels, and adrenal glucocorticoid insufficiency. Hematopoietic
reconstitution failed to correct this hormonal deficit, but the
phenotype of reduced body weight and diminished survival was rescued by
systemic glucocorticoid-hormone administration. Ezzat et al. (2005)
concluded that Ikaros plays a role in orchestrating immune-endocrine
development and function.

Yap et al. (2005) identified Ikaros-binding elements in the 5-prime
flanking regions of pufferfish, mouse, and human STAT4 (600558).
Transactivation, electrophoretic mobility shift, and RNA interference
analyses showed that Ikaros bound to the STAT4 promoter and was involved
in regulation of STAT4 in human T cells.

Dijon et al. (2008) found that purified CD34 (142230)-positive human
cord blood cells and adult peripheral blood cells that were cultured
under erythroid conditions expressed the DNA-binding Ikaros isoforms IK1
through IK4, but not the dominant-negative isoform IK6.
Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that expression of IK6 in these
cells resulted in complex formation between IK6 and IK1, and IK6
decreased cell number and increased cell death. IK6 overexpression
disturbed erythroid differentiation and expression of erythroid-specific
genes, although it had no effect on Ikaros expression, and favored
myelopoiesis by promoting expression of myeloid-specific genes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Dijon et al. (2008) stated that the IKZF1 gene contains 7 translated
exons.

MAPPING

Using somatic cell hybrid DNAs, Molnar et al. (1996) mapped the human
Ikaros gene to 7p13-p11.1, near the EGFR gene (131550). They mapped the
mouse Ikaros gene to chromosome 11 by interspecific backcross analysis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Ikaros is required for normal lymphocyte development. Germline mutant
mice that express only non-DNA-binding dominant-negative 'leukemogenic'
Ikaros isoforms lacking critical N-terminal zinc fingers develop an
aggressive form of lymphoblastic leukemia 3 to 6 months after birth (see
'Animal Model' below). These facts prompted Sun et al. (1999) to seek
molecular abnormalities involving the Ikaros gene in acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL2; 613067) in infants. In leukemic cells from 12 ALL
infants less than 1 year of age, Sun et al. (1999) found high-level
expression of dominant-negative isoforms of Ikaros with abnormal
subcellular compartmentalization patterns. PCR cloning and nucleotide
sequencing were used to identify the specific Ikaros isoforms and detect
Ikaros gene mutations in these cells. Leukemic cells from 7 of 7 infants
with ALL, including 5 of 5 MLL-AF4-positive (159557) infants, expressed
dominant-negative Ikaros isoforms IK4, IK7, and IK8 that lack critical
N-terminal zinc fingers. In 6 of 7 patients, Sun et al. (1999) detected
an in-frame deletion of 10 amino acids (KSSMPQKFLG) upstream of the
transcription-activation domain adjacent to the C-terminal zinc fingers
of IK2, IK4, IK7, and IK8. In contrast, only wildtype IK1 and IK2
isoforms with normal nuclear localization were found in normal infant
bone marrow cells and infant thymocytes. These results implicated the
expression of dominant-negative Ikaros isoforms and the disruption of
normal Ikaros function in the leukemogenesis of ALL in infants.

Nakase et al. (2000) found overexpression of the dominant-negative IK6
isoform in 14 of 41 B-cell patients with adult B-cell ALL. None of the
other dominant-negative isoforms of the Ikaros gene were detected by
RT-PCR analysis. Southern blot analysis with PstI digestion revealed
that those patients with the dominant-negative IK6 isoform might have
small mutations in the Ikaros locus. The results suggested that Ikaros
plays a key role in human B-cell malignancies through the
dominant-negative isoform IK6.

Using RT-PCR to detect Ikaros isoforms with the 30-base deletion in exon
6, Payne et al. (2001) showed that transcripts for IK1 and IK1 with the
deletion were present in normal cord blood and bone marrow, as well as
in 3 ALL cell lines. In addition, they identified an isoform, IKX, that
was identical to IK3 except that it included exon 6; IKX was generated
from a novel exon combination with and without the 30-base deletion.
Payne et al. (2001) detected multiple DNA-binding and nonbinding
isoforms with a 60-base insertion linked to leukemia expressed at the
RNA level in normal hemopoietic cells. Immunoblot analysis indicated
that the predominant isoform in normal cells is IKX, while the
predominant form in leukemic cells is IK1.

In a genomewide analysis of leukemic cells from 242 pediatric ALL
patients using high resolution, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
arrays and genomic DNA sequencing, Mullighan et al. (2007) identified
mutations in genes encoding principal regulators of B-lymphocyte
development and differentiation in 40% of B-progenitor ALL cases.
Deletions were detected in IKZF1, IKZF3 (606221),TCF3 (147141), EBF1
(164343), and LEF1 (153245). The PAX5 (167414) gene was the most
frequent target of somatic mutation, being altered in 31.7% of cases.

The Philadelphia chromosome, a chromosomal abnormality that encodes
BCR-ABL1 (see 151410, 189980), is the defining lesion of chronic
myelogenous leukemia (CML) and a subset of acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(ALL). To define oncogenic lesions that cooperate with BCR-ABL1 to
induce ALL, Mullighan et al. (2008) performed a genomewide analysis of
diagnostic leukemia samples from 304 individuals with ALL, including 43
BCR-ABL1 B-progenitor ALLs and 23 CML cases. IKZF1, encoding the
transcription factor Ikaros, was deleted in 83.7% of BCR-ABL1 ALL, but
not in chronic phase CML. Deletion of IKZF1 was also identified as an
acquired lesion at the time of transformation of CML to ALL (lymphoid
blast crisis). The IKZF1 deletions resulted in haploinsufficiency,
expression of a dominant-negative Ikaros isoform, or the complete loss
of Ikaros expression. Sequencing of IKZF1 deletion breakpoints suggested
that aberrant RAG-mediated recombination (see 179615) is responsible for
the deletions. Mullighan et al. (2008) concluded that genetic lesions
resulting in the loss of Ikaros function are an important event in the
development of BCR-ABL1 ALL.

Mullighan et al. (2009) identified deletions involving the IKZF1 gene in
leukemic cells of 63 (28.6%) of 221 children with B-cell acute
lymphoblastic leukemia. Cells from 20 patients had a deletion of coding
exons 3 through 6, resulting in the expression of a dominant-negative
form of IKZF1. IKZF1 deletions were associated with an increased risk of
relapse and adverse effects in the original cohort and in an independent
cohort of 258 patients (p values ranging from less than 0.001 to 0.004).

For a discussion of a possible association between variation in the
IKZF1 gene and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, see ALL2 (613067).

CYTOGENETICS

The BCL6 gene (109565), isolated from the breakpoints of 3q27-associated
chromosomal translocations, is implicated in diffuse large B-cell
lymphomas (DLBL). Hosokawa et al. (2000) described the molecular
characterization of novel t(3;7)(q27;p12) translocations in 2 patients
with DLBL. Molecular genetic analysis of the breakpoint area involving
BCL6 revealed the presence of the Ikaros gene. As a molecular
consequence of the translocation, the 5-prime regulatory region of BCL6
was replaced by the putative 5-prime regulatory region of the Ikaros
gene, probably leading to deregulated expression of the BCL6 gene
throughout B-cell differentiation. RT-PCR and FISH analyses of a patient
sample established that the translocation resulted in fusion of the
Ikaros and BCL6 genes. The clinical features of the 2 patients with DLBL
and t(3;7)(q27;p12) translocations were reported by Ichinohasama et al.
(1998).

ANIMAL MODEL

Mice homozygous for a germline mutation in the Ikaros DNA-binding domain
lack not only T and B lymphocytes and natural killer cells, but also
their earliest defined progenitors (Georgopoulos et al., 1994). In
contrast, the erythroid and myeloid lineages are intact in these mutant
mice. Klug et al. (1998) showed that the DNA-binding isoforms of mouse
Ikaros are localized in the nucleus of the most primitive hematopoietic
stem cell subset. They found that Ikaros localizes to heterochromatin in
Abelson-transformed pre-B lymphocytes. Changes in the RNA splicing
pattern of Ikaros occurred at 2 stages of lymphoid differentiation.

O'Neill et al. (1999, 2000) described the structure of a chromatin
remodeling complex associated with Ikaros that is present only in adult
hematopoietic cells. This complex binds to Ikaros-like DNA-binding
sites, including a long polypyrimidine-rich sequence upstream of the
human delta-globin gene (142000), and was thus called PYR complex.
Deletion of this sequence in a human beta locus-containing cosmid
(carrying sequences from the human gamma-A gene, 142200, through the
adult beta-globin gene, 141900) in transgenic mice resulted in delayed
switching from gamma-globin to beta-globin. Lopez et al. (2002) showed
that homozygous Ikaros-null mice lacked the PYR complex, demonstrating a
requirement for Ikaros in the formation of the complex on DNA.
Heterozygous Ikaros-null mice had about half as much PYR complex,
indicating a dosage effect for both Ikaros and PYR complex. They also
showed that Ikaros-null mice had multiple hematopoietic cell defects,
including anemia and megakaryocytic abnormalities, in addition to
lymphoid and stem cell defects. The null mice also had a delay in murine
embryonic-to-adult beta-globin switching and a delay in human
gamma-to-beta switching, consistent with the suggested role for PYR
complex in this process. Lastly, cDNA array analyses indicated that
several hematopoietic cell-specific genes in all blood lineages were
either up- or downregulated in 14-day embryos from Ikaros-null mice
compared with wildtype mice. These results indicated that Ikaros and PYR
complex function together in vivo at many adult hematopoietic
cell-specific genes and at intergenic sites, affecting their expression
and leading to pleiotropic hematopoietic defects.

Plasmacytoid dendritic cells are specialized dendritic cells that
produce high levels of type I interferon (see IFNA1; 147660) upon viral
infection. Allman et al. (2006) showed that mice expressing low levels
of Ikaros lacked peripheral plasmacytoid dendritic cells but not other
dendritic cell subsets. Loss of plasmacytoid dendritic cells was
associated with inability to produce type I interferon after challenge
with Tlr7 (300365) or Tlr9 (605474) ligands or murine cytomegalovirus.
Conventional dendritic cells were present in normal numbers and
exhibited normal responses to in vivo challenge with murine
cytomegalovirus or inactivated toxoplasma antigen.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ST3GAL3 gene encodes
beta-galactoside-alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase-III, a Golgi resident
membrane protein that forms the sialyl Lewis a (sLe-a) epitope on
glyocoproteins. These glycoproteins form the glycocalyx, composed of
sialic acids that act as key determinants of a variety of cellular
recognition and communication processes (summary by Hu et al., 2011).

CLONING

By screening a human placenta cDNA library with a probe based on the
sialyl motif (a highly conserved region in the catalytic domain of
sialyltransferases), Kitagawa and Paulson (1993) isolated a cDNA
encoding SIAT6, which they termed ST3N (EC 2.4.99.6). The deduced
375-amino acid protein is 97% identical to the rat protein. SDS-PAGE
analysis showed expression of an 80-kD protein having sialyltransferase
activity. Northern blot analysis revealed wide expression of a 2.7-kb
transcript with abundant expression in skeletal muscle and high
expression in fetal tissue but low expression in placenta.

Using Northern blot analysis, Kitagawa and Paulson (1994) evaluated the
differential expression of 5 human sialyltransferase genes in adult and
fetal tissues. A 2.7-kb ST3N transcript was expressed highly in skeletal
muscle and moderately in most other tissues examined. A 3.8-kb
transcript was also expressed in testis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Taniguchi et al. (2003) determined that the 5-prime UTR of the ST3GAL3
gene consists of 2 exons. The 5-prime flanking region of the promoter
lacks canonical TATA or CCAAT boxes, but it contains several putative
transcriptional factor binding sites.

Hu et al. (2011) stated that the ST3GAL3 gene contains 15 exons, 12 of
which are coding exons.

MAPPING

The International RH Mapping Consortium mapped the SIAT6 gene to
chromosome 1 (TMAP stSG22084).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Autosomal Recessive Mental Retardation 12

In affected members of 2 unrelated consanguineous Iranian families with
autosomal recessive nonsyndromic mental retardation-12 (MRT12; 611090),
Hu et al. (2011) used linkage analysis, chromosome sorting, and
next-generation sequencing to identify 2 different homozygous mutations
in the ST3GAL3 gene (A13D, 606494.0001 and D370Y, 606494.0002,
respectively.) Neither mutation affected the highly conserved sialyl
motifs, but rather affected the N-terminal transmembrane domain and
catalytic domain, respectively. In vitro functional expression studies
showed that the mutant proteins were mislocalized to the endoplasmic
reticulum and that one (D370Y) had loss of catalytic activity. The
findings demonstrated a link between the glycoprotein complex,
sialyltransferase activity, and higher cognitive functioning.

- Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy 15

In 4 members of a consanguineous Palestinian family with early infantile
epileptic encephalopathy-15 (EIEE15; 615006), Edvardson et al. (2013)
identified a homozygous mutation in the ST3GAL3 gene (A320P;
606494.0003). The mutation was identified by linkage analysis combined
with whole-exome sequencing of 1 individual and confirmed by Sanger
sequencing. The mutation affected the highly conserved sialyl motif S,
which is crucially involved in binding of both donor and acceptor
substrate. In vitro functional expression studies showed that secretion
of the mutant protein was reduced to 25% of control levels and it had no
detectable enzymatic activity. The phenotype was severe: patients showed
delayed psychomotor development and had onset of refractory infantile
spasms between ages 3 and 7 months associated with hypsarrhythmia on
EEG. Other features included hypotonia, poor eye contact, and inability
to speak or walk, even later in childhood. All were profoundly mentally
retarded. Edvardson et al. (2013) noted that the phenotype was more
severe than that observed by Hu et al. (2011), who had identified
ST3GAL3 mutations outside of the highly conserved and functionally
important sialyl motifs.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MENTAL RETARDATION, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 12
ST3GAL3, ALA13ASP

In affected members of a consanguineous Iranian family with autosomal
recessive mental retardation-12 (MRT12; 611090), previously reported by
Najmabadi et al. (2007), Hu et al. (2011) identified a homozygous 38C-A
transversion in exon 2 of the ST3GAL3 gene, resulting in an ala13-to-asp
(A13D) substitution in the transmembrane domain. The mutation was not
found in 278 copies of chromosome 1 from ethnically matched controls or
in 385 control individuals. In vitro functional expression studies in
murine fibroblasts showed that most of the mutant protein was improperly
localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, preventing the protein from
interacting with its substrates in the Golgi, resulting in a loss of
function. Catalytic activity of the A13D mutant enzyme was similar to
wildtype.

.0002
MENTAL RETARDATION, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 12
ST3GAL3, ASP370TYR

In affected members of a consanguineous Iranian family with autosomal
recessive mental retardation-12 (MRT12; 611090), Hu et al. (2011)
identified a homozygous 1108G-T transversion in exon 14 of the ST3GAL3
gene, resulting in an asp370-to-tyr (D370Y) substitution in the
catalytic domain at the C-terminal end of the protein. The mutation was
not found in 278 copies of chromosome 1 from ethnically matched controls
or in 385 control individuals. In vitro functional expression studies in
murine fibroblasts showed that the mutant protein was improperly
localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, preventing the protein from
interacting with its substrates in the Golgi, resulting in a loss of
function. The D370Y mutant protein also showed a complete lack of enzyme
activity. Studies of recombinant proteins in CHO cells indicated that
secretion of the D370Y mutant protein was dramatically reduced compared
to wildtype. Hu et al. (2011) concluded that the mutant protein was
cleared by the endoplasmic reticulum-mediated system, suggesting that
the C terminus is important for the proper folding of functional
ST3GAL3.

.0003
EPILEPTIC ENCEPHALOPATHY, EARLY INFANTILE, 15
ST3GAL3, ALA320PRO

In 4 members of a consanguineous Palestinian family with early infantile
epileptic encephalopathy-15 (EIEE15; 615006), Edvardson et al. (2013)
identified a homozygous 958G-C transversion in exon 12 of the ST3GAL3
gene, resulting in an ala320-to-pro (A320P) substitution at a highly
conserved residue in the sialyl motif S. The mutation was identified by
linkage analysis combined with whole-exome sequencing of 1 individual
and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. It segregated with the disorder in
the family and was not found in 123 controls of the same ethnic origin
or in 5,379 control exomes. In vitro functional expression studies
showed that secretion of the mutant protein was reduced to 25% of
control levels and that the protein had no detectable enzymatic
activity.

ATF4 belongs to the large ATF/CREB family of transcription factors.
These proteins bind DNA via their basic region and dimerize via their
leucine zipper domain to form a variety of homo- and heterodimers to
regulate gene transcription (De Angelis et al., 2003).

CLONING

An activating transcription factor (ATF)-binding site is a promoter
element present in a wide variety of viral and cellular genes, including
E1A-inducible adenoviral genes and cAMP-inducible cellular genes. Hai et
al. (1989) identified cDNAs encoding 8 different human ATF
consensus-binding proteins, including a partial cDNA corresponding to
ATF4. They found that members of this family share significant sequence
similarity within a leucine zipper DNA-binding motif and an adjacent
basic region; the proteins show little similarity outside of these
regions.

The cAMP response element (CRE) is an octanucleotide motif that mediates
diverse transcriptional regulatory effects. By screening a Jurkat T-cell
line expression library for the ability to bind CRE, Karpinski et al.
(1992) isolated a full-length cDNA corresponding to ATF4, which they
called CREB2 (CRE-binding protein-2). The predicted protein contains 351
amino acids. Northern blot analysis revealed that the 1.5-kb CREB2 mRNA
was expressed in all human tumor cell lines and mouse organs tested.

GENE FUNCTION

Karpinski et al. (1992) found that, unlike CREB (123810), which
activates transcription from CRE-containing promoters, CREB2 functions
as a specific repressor of CRE-dependent transcription. The
transcriptional repressor activity resides within the C-terminal leucine
zipper and basic domain region of the CREB2 protein.

The p40tax gene product of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)
activates HTLV-1 viral transcription in trans through tax-responsive
enhancers in the long terminal repeats. Tsujimoto et al. (1991)
identified ATF4 as TAXREB67, a protein that binds to the tax-responsive
enhancer element in HTLV-1.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay, He et al. (2001) found that mouse Nrf2
(NFE2L2; 600492) interacted with rat Atf4. Coimmunoprecipitation and
mammalian 2-hybrid analyses confirmed the interaction. An Nrf2-Atf4
dimer bound a stress response element (StRE) sequence from an Nrf2
target gene, Ho1 (HMOX1; 141250). CdCl2, an Ho1 inducer, increased
expression of Atf4 in mouse hepatoma cells prior to induction of Ho1. A
dominant-negative Atf4 mutant inhibited basal and CdCl2-induced
expression of an StRE-dependent construct in hepatoma cells, but it only
inhibited basal expression in a human mammary epithelial cell line. He
et al. (2001) concluded that ATF4 regulates HO1 expression in a
cell-specific manner, possibly in a complex with NRF2.

Siu et al. (2002) presented evidence that ATF4 binds nutrient-sensing
response element-1 (NSRE1) in the human asparagine synthetase (ASNS;
108370) gene and activates ASNS transcription in response to nutrient
stress.

Bagheri-Yarmand et al. (2003) found that expression of Atf4 was high in
virgin mouse mammary glands and in pregnant mammary glands, but it was
dramatically reduced during lactation and higher after weaning.
Transgenic mice overexpressing Atf4 in mammary epithelium showed
decreased proliferation and impaired differentiation of alveolar
epithelial cells during pregnancy and lactation. In addition, Atf4
overexpression induced apoptosis and accelerated involution of the
mammary gland, suggesting a role for ATF4 in the regulation of normal
mammary gland involution.

De Angelis et al. (2003) showed that human ATF4 and RBP3 (E2F1; 189971)
dimerized in vitro and in vivo and that RBP3 enhanced ATF4
transactivating activity. Expression of both proteins increased during
differentiation of a mouse myogenic cell line.

ATF4 has 2 upstream ORFs (uORFs) that are conserved in vertebrates. The
more 3-prime uORF, uORF2, extends into the coding region of full-length
ATF4. Independently, Lu et al. (2004) and Vattem and Wek (2004) found
that scanning ribosomes initiated translation at both uORFs of mouse
Atf4, and that ribosomes that translated uORF1 efficiently reinitiated
translation at downstream AUGs. In unstressed mouse fibroblasts, low
levels of phosphorylated Eif2 (see EIF2S1; 603907) favored early
capacitation of reinitiating ribosomes, directing them to the inhibitory
uORF2 downstream of uORF1, which precluded translation of Atf4 and
repressed the integrated stress response. In stressed cells, high levels
of phosphorylated Eif2 delayed capacitation of reinitiating ribosomes,
favoring reinitiation at the Atf4 coding sequence over uORF2, which
permitted Atf4 expression and activated the integrated stress response.

Using Rsk2 (300075) -/- mice, Yang et al. (2004) showed that RSK2 is
required for osteoblast differentiation and function. They identified
the transcription factor ATF4 as a critical substrate of RSK2 that is
required for the timely onset of osteoblast differentiation, for
terminal differentiation of osteoblasts, and for osteoblast-specific
gene expression. Additionally, RSK2 and ATF4 were found to
posttranscriptionally regulate the synthesis of type I collagen (see
120150), the main constituent of the bone matrix. Accordingly, Atf4
deficiency in mice resulted in delayed bone formation during embryonic
development and low bone mass throughout postnatal life. Yang et al.
(2004) concluded that ATF4 is a critical regulator of osteoblast
differentiation and function and that lack of ATF4 phosphorylation by
RSK2 may contribute to the skeletal phenotype of Coffin-Lowry syndrome
(303600).

Blais et al. (2004) determined that EIF2-alpha (EIF2S1), PERK (EIF2AK3;
604032), ATF4, and GADD34 (PPP1R15A; 611048) are involved in an
integrated adaptive response to hypoxic stress in HeLa cells.

Sayer et al. (2006) performed a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human fetal
brain expression library and identified ATF4 as a direct interaction
partner of CEP290 (NPHP6; 610142). The protein-interaction domains
mapped to the N-terminal third of CEP290, encoded by exons 2 through 21,
and the C-terminal two-thirds of ATF4. To confirm that CEP290 and ATF4
interact physiologically in vivo, Sayer et al. (2006) performed
coimmunoprecipitation experiments using bovine retina extracts.
Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that endogenous ATF4 can be
immunoprecipitated using an antibody to CEP290 but not using a control
IgG. Reverse coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that antibody to
ATF4 can also precipitate endogenous CEP290.

Lin et al. (2010) showed that although Skp2 (601436) inactivation on its
own does not induce cellular senescence, aberrant protooncogenic signals
as well as inactivation of tumor suppressor genes do trigger a potent,
tumor-suppressive senescence response in mice and cells devoid of Skp2.
Notably, Skp2 inactivation and oncogenic stress-driven senescence
neither elicit activation of the p19(Arf) (see 600160)-p53 (191170)
pathway nor DNA damage, but instead depend on Aft4, p27 (600778), and
p21 (116899). Lin et al. (2010) further demonstrated that genetic Skp2
inactivation evokes cellular senescence even in oncogenic conditions in
which the p19(Arf)-p53 response is impaired, whereas a Skp2-SCF complex
inhibitor can trigger cellular senescence in p53/Pten (601728)-deficient
cells and tumor regression in preclinical studies. Lin et al. (2010)
concluded that their findings provided proof-of-principle evidence that
pharmacologic inhibition of Skp2 may represent a general approach for
cancer prevention and therapy.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the ATF4
gene to chromosome 22 (TMAP stSG29796).

ANIMAL MODEL

Tanaka et al. (1998) used gene targeting to generate mice lacking Atf4.
They found that Atf4-deficient mice exhibited severe microphthalmia. The
Atf4-deficient eyes revealed a normal gross lens structure up to
embryonic day 14.5, after which the lens degenerated due to apoptosis
without the formation of lens secondary fiber cells. Retinal development
was normal in the mutant mice. The lens-specific expression of Atf4 in
the mutant mice led not only to the recovery of lens secondary fibers
but also to the induction of hyperplasia of these fibers. Tanaka et al.
(1998) concluded that ATF4 is essential for the later stages of lens
fiber cell differentiation.

NOMENCLATURE

The ATF4 gene, which Karpinski et al. (1992) referred to as CREB2,
should not be confused with the ATF2 gene (123811), which was formerly
known as CREB2.

605625	TITLE *605625 MYELOMA OVEREXPRESSED GENE; MYEOV
DESCRIPTION Translocations involving the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (IgH; see
147100) at 14q32.3 are mediated by errors during VDJ recombination
either early in development or during class-switch recombination at
later stages in B-cell development. Such translocations occur in as many
as 70% of multiple myelomas and plasma cell leukemias. See 254500.

By cloning gastric carcinoma tumor DNA into phage vectors, probing with
human Alu repetitive sequences, and exon-trap analysis, Janssen et al.
(2000) isolated a cDNA encoding MYEOV (myeloma overexpressed gene).
Sequence analysis predicted that the 313-amino acid protein contains no
known functional motifs except for an RNP1 motif typical of RNA-binding
proteins and a leucine-isoleucine tail similar to cytoplasmically
exposed membrane proteins with a C-terminal membrane anchor. Northern
blot analysis detected a major 2.8-kb and a minor 3.5-kb transcript in
various tumor cell lines. In 3 of 7 multiple myeloma cell lines with a
t(11;14)(q13;q32) and cyclin D1 (CCND1; 168461) overexpression, Northern
blot analysis determined that MYEOV was overexpressed. In all 7 cell
lines, the breakpoint was mapped to the 360-kb region between the 2
genes. MYEOV overexpression was associated with the juxtaposition of an
enhancer to the MYEOV gene.

Using FISH, Janssen et al. (2000) mapped the MYEOV gene to 11q13.1, 360
kb centromeric to CCND1.

DNA amplifications at 11q13 are frequently observed in esophageal
squamous cell carcinoma (133239) and correlate with a malignant
phenotype. Although this amplicon spans a region of several megabases
and harbors numerous genes, CCND1 and EMS1 (164765) are thought to be
the relevant candidates in esophageal carcinoma. Janssen et al. (2002)
investigated whether the putative transforming gene MYEOV, mapping 360
kb centromeric to CCND1 and activated concomitantly with CCND1 in a
subset of t(11;14)(q13;q32) positive multiple myeloma cell lines,
represents a target of 11q13 amplification in esophageal carcinoma. They
tested 31 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell lines and 48 primary
tumors for copy number levels of MYEOV and demonstrated that MYEOV was
always coamplified with CCND1. However, its activation was sometimes
inhibited by an epigenetic mechanism.

607290	TITLE *607290 SHISA, XENOPUS, HOMOLOG OF, 5; SHISA5
;;SCOTIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Zhang et al. (2000) cloned a cDNA encoding Scotin, which they called
HSPC217, from CD34 (142230)-positive hematopoietic stem/progenitor
cells. The deduced 170-amino acid protein contains an MYB (189990)
DNA-binding domain repeat signature. Microarray analysis of 5
hematopoietic cell lines detected low-level expression of Scotin in NB4
and Jurkat cells, but no expression was detected in HL60, K562, and U937
cells.

Bourdon et al. (2002) identified mouse Scotin by differential display of
spleen and thymus of normal and p53 (191170) null mice after gamma
irradiation of whole animals. The induced 1.85-kb transcript encodes a
deduced 235-amino acid protein. By searching an EST database using the
mouse sequence as probe, followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE, Bourdon
et al. (2002) cloned a full-length cDNA encoding Scotin from a placenta
cDNA library. The deduced 240-amino acid human protein shares 70%
identity with mouse Scotin. Both the human and the mouse proteins
contain an N-terminal signal sequence, a central transmembrane domain
composed of 18 hydrophobic amino acids, and a proline/tyrosine domain,
and both show an apparent molecular mass of 25 kD by Western blot
analysis. Immunolocalization of exogenously expressed Scotin revealed
colocalization with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) markers. By mutation
analysis, Bourdon et al. (2002) determined that the proline-rich domain
is required for ER localization.

GENE FUNCTION

Bourdon et al. (2002) noted that mouse thymus and spleen cells underwent
massive p53-dependent apoptosis following ultraviolet irradiation or
exposure to actinomycin D. They found that Scotin mRNA was induced
coincident with apoptosis and was expressed only in spleen and thymus of
irradiated wildtype mice and not in the spleen or thymus of irradiated
p53 null mice. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, they
confirmed direct binding between p53 and Scotin, and using a luciferase
reporter plasmid driven by the mouse Scotin promoter, they confirmed
dose-dependent p53 transactiviation. Furthermore, Bourdon et al. (2002)
showed that the apoptosis induced by the p53/Scotin pathway is caspase
dependent.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Bourdon et al. (2002) determined that the
human Scotin gene contains 6 exons. They identified a p53-responsive
element of 9 decamers within the mouse Scotin promoter.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Zhang et al. (2000) mapped the human
Scotin gene to chromosome 3. By genomic sequence analysis, Bourdon et
al. (2002) mapped the Scotin gene to chromosome 3p21.3. They also
identified a Scotin pseudogene on chromosome Xq13.1-q13.3.

600764	TITLE *600764 MAJOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY COMPLEX, CLASS I-RELATED; MR1
;;MAJOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY COMPLEX, CLASS I-LIKE SEQUENCE; HLALS;;
MHC-RELATED PROTEIN 1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Hashimoto et al. (1995) identified an expressed class I gene, which they
called MR1 (or MHC-related 1), by means of a PCR-based strategy using 2
primers that correspond to the 2 conserved regions in the alpha-3 domain
of class I molecules. Similar to a typical class I molecule, the MR1
protein comprises a signal sequence, 3 extracellular domains (alpha-1,
alpha-2, and alpha-3), a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain.

GENE FUNCTION

Treiner et al. (2003) showed that T cells that express the canonical
hV-alpha-7.2-J-alpha-33 TCR rearrangement are preferentially located in
the gut lamina propria of humans and are therefore genuine
mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells. Selection and/or expansion
of this population requires B lymphocytes, as MAIT cells are absent in
B-cell-deficient patients. In addition, Treiner et al. (2003)
demonstrated that MAIT cells are selected and/or restricted by MR1, a
monomorphic major histocompatibility complex class I-related molecule
that is markedly conserved in diverse mammalian species. MAIT cells are
not present in germ-free mice, indicating that commensal flora are
required for their expansion in the gut lamina propria. Treiner et al.
(2003) concluded that this indicates that MAIT cells are probably
involved in the host response at the site of pathogen entry, and may
regulate intestinal B-cell activity.

Kjer-Nielsen et al. (2012) demonstrated that the structure and chemistry
within the antigen-binding cleft of MR1 is distinct from the MHC and CD1
families. MR1 is ideally suited to bind ligands originating from vitamin
metabolites. The structure of MR1 in complex with 6-formyl pterin, a
folic acid (vitamin B9) metabolite, shows the pterin ring sequestered
within MR1. Furthermore, Kjer-Nielsen et al. (2012) characterized
related MR1-restricted vitamin derivatives, originating from the
bacterial riboflavin (vitamin B2) biosynthetic pathway, which
specifically and potently activate MAIT cells. Accordingly, the authors
showed that metabolites of vitamin B represent a class of antigen that
are presented by MR1 for MAIT cell immunosurveillance. Kjer-Nielsen et
al. (2012) concluded that since many vitamin biosynthetic pathways are
unique to bacteria and yeast, MAIT cells use these metabolites to detect
microbial infection.

MAPPING

Hashimoto et al. (1995) mapped the MR1 gene by fluorescence in situ
hybridization to 1q25.3. The localization of MR1 on chromosome 1 was
also supported by the results of PCR amplification of the MR1 fragment
from somatic cell hybrid DNAs.

GENE FAMILY

Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules present
antigenic peptides to CD8-positive T cells. The HLA class I gene family
in humans consists of 6 members: polymorphic HLA-A (142800), HLA-B
(142830), and HLA-C (142840), and oligomorphic HLA-E (143010), HLA-F
(143110), and HLA-G (142871). The functions of HLA-E, -F, and -G
molecules are unknown, although HLA-G may play a role in the
maternal-fetal interaction. Several groups of human class I-related
molecules have been identified, including the CD1 family (e.g., CD1A;
188370), zinc-alpha-2-glycoprotein (AZGP1; 194460), MHC class I
chain-related molecule A (MICA; 600169), and a human homolog of the rat
neonatal Fc receptor (Simister and Mostov, 1989) (summary by Hashimoto
et al., 1995).

EVOLUTION

In contrast to other known human divergent class I genes, MR1 encodes
peptide-binding domains similar to those encoded by HLA class I genes on
chromosome 6 and by nonmammalian classical MHC class I genes.
Identification of a homolog of MR1 in the mouse genome implied that the
ancestor of MR1 was present in the primordial mammalian species.
Hashimoto et al. (1995) suggested that species at distinct evolutionary
stages may adapt distinct gene lineages for their MHC. For example, in a
New World primate (the cotton-top tamarin), the most broadly expressed
class I gene lineage is HLA-G, which in the human is expressed only in a
highly restricted manner and is oligomorphic. They suggested further
that the location of the CD1 gene family, also on 1q, as well as many
other members of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily, may be
significant.

612605	TITLE *612605 LATE CORNIFIED ENVELOPE 1C; LCE1C
;;LATE ENVELOPE PROTEIN 3; LEP3
DESCRIPTION For background information on the LCE gene cluster, see 612603.

CLONING

By database analysis to identify human orthologs of mouse genes encoding
late envelope proteins (LEPs), Marshall et al. (2001) identified LCE1C,
which they called LEP3.

Using real-time PCR, Jackson et al. (2005) detected high LCE1C
expression in human fetal, arm, penal, and abdominal skin. Expression
was much lower in vulva and was not detected in tongue and esophagus.

GENE FUNCTION

Jackson et al. (2005) showed that expression of LCE1 genes, including
LCE1C, was upregulated in cultured normal human keratinocytes by
ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, but not by calcium. Induction of LCE1C
could be detected 24 hours after UV irradiation and was very high 36
hours after UV irradiation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Jackson et al. (2005) determined that the LCE1C gene contains 2 exons.
Exon 1 is noncoding.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Marshall et al. (2001) mapped the LCE1C
gene within the LCE gene cluster on chromosome 1q21. Jackson et al.
(2005) stated that the mouse Lce1c gene maps to a syntenic LCE gene
cluster on chromosome 3F1.

615196	TITLE *615196 SHORT-CHAIN DEHYDROGENASE/REDUCTASE FAMILY, MEMBER 4-LIKE 2; DHRS4L2
;;DHRS4-LIKE 2;;
DHRS4P1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase enzymes, like DHRS4 (611596), are
NAD/NADP-dependent oxidoreductases that function in the breakdown of
steroids, retinoids, prostaglandins, and xenobiotics. DHRS4L2 arose by
duplication of the DHRS4 gene (summary by Gabrielli and Tofanelli,
2012).

CLONING

By RT-PCR of human neuroblastoma cell lines, Zhang et al. (2009) cloned
8 DHRS4L2 splice variants that originated from an alternative upstream
first exon. Database analysis revealed expression of DHRS4L2 from the
upstream exon in several normal human tissues, including brain,
placenta, and testis. RT-PCR confirmed abundant expression from the
upstream exon in testis, with much lower expression in other tissues
examined. RNA structural analysis of 2 of the variants suggested that
they are noncoding.

Gabrielli and Tofanelli (2012) reported that DHRS4L2, which they called
DHRS4P1, is transcribed, but that it contains a frameshift and stop
signal in exon 6 compared with DHRS4, which terminates in exon 8. The
deduced DHRS4L2 protein shares significant identity with the N-terminal
210 amino acids of DHRS4, but it lacks the C-terminal region of DHRS4.
Gabrielli and Tofanelli (2012) suggested that DHRS4L2 may be a
transcribed pseudogene.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhang et al. (2009) determined that the DHRS4L2 gene contains 9 exons,
including 2 alternative first exons associated with alternative
promoters. The region upstream of exon 1 contains TATA and CCAAT boxes
and CpG islands.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Zhang et al. (2009) mapped the DHRS4L2
gene near the DHRS4 gene on chromosome 14q11.2.

608408	TITLE *608408 DEVELOPMENTAL PLURIPOTENCY-ASSOCIATED GENE 3; DPPA3
;;STELLA, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF;;
PRIMORDIAL GERM CELL PROTEIN 7; PGC7
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening for genes expressed in a sex-specific manner during early
embryonic gonadal development in the mouse, Bowles et al. (2003) cloned
Dppa3. The deduced protein contains 150 amino acids. Northern blot
analysis detected a 1.2-kb transcript expressed in male mouse gonads at
13.5 days postcoitum. In situ hybridization of whole mouse embryos
showed Dppa3 expressed initially in the gonads of both sexes, but
expression was downregulated in female gonads by at least 13.5 days
postcoitum. Embryonic mice deficient in germ cells did not express
Dppa3. Bowles et al. (2003) identified human DPPA3, which encodes a
160-amino acid protein. EST database searches revealed that human DPPA3
expression had been detected only in germ cell tumors, but not in normal
testis.

GENE FUNCTION

West et al. (2009) differentiated mouse embryonic stem cells carrying a
Stella transgenic reporter into putative primordial germ cells (PGCs) in
vitro. The Stella-positive cells possessed a transcriptional profile
similar to embryo-derived PGCs, and like their counterparts in vivo,
lost imprints in a time-dependent manner. Using inhibitory RNAs to
screen candidate genes for effects on the development of Stella-positive
cells in vitro, West et al. (2009) found that Lin28 (611043), a negative
regulator of let7 (605386) microRNA processing, is essential for proper
PGC development. Furthermore, Blimp1 (PRDM1; 603423), a let7 target and
a master regulator of PGC specification, rescued the effect of Lin28
deficiency during PGC development, thereby establishing a mechanism of
action for Lin28 during PGC specification. Overexpression of Lin28
promotes formation of Stella-positive cells in vitro and PGCs in
chimeric embryos, and is associated with human germ cell tumors.

Nakamura et al. (2012) showed that PGC7 protects 5-methylcytosine (5mC)
from Tet3 (613555)-mediated conversion to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC)
by binding to maternal chromatin containing dimethylated histone H3
lysine-9 (H3K9me2) in mice. In addition, imprinted loci that are marked
with H3K9me2 in mature sperm are protected by PGC7 binding in early
embryogenesis. Nakamura et al. (2012) suggested that this type of
regulatory mechanism could be involved in DNA modifications in somatic
cells as well as in early embryos.

MAPPING

Bowles et al. (2003) identified the DPPA3 gene on chromosome 12p13.31.
They stated that the mouse Dppa3 gene maps to chromosome 6F2 in a region
that shows homology of synteny to human chromosome 12p13.31.

611984	TITLE *611984 MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN S21; MRPS21
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mitochondria have their own translation system for production of 13
proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation. MRPS21 is 1 of more
than 70 protein components of mitochondrial ribosomes that are encoded
by the nuclear genome (Kenmochi et al., 2001).

CLONING

By proteolytic digestion of whole bovine 28S subunits, followed by
peptide analysis and EST database analysis, Koc et al. (2001) identified
full-length human MRPS21. The deduced 87-amino acid MRPS21 protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 10.7 kD. Koc et al. (2001) identified
MRPS21 orthologs in mouse, Drosophila, C. elegans, yeast, and E. coli.
Highest conservation is in the N-terminal and central regions of MRPS21
orthologs. Mouse and human MRPS21 share 90.8% amino acid identity.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis and analysis of an integrated BAC-STS map,
Kenmochi et al. (2001) mapped the MRPS21 gene to chromosome 1q21. Zhang
and Gerstein (2003) identified 9 MRPS21 pseudogenes scattered throughout
the genome.

300463	TITLE *300463 POLYGLUTAMINE-BINDING PROTEIN 1; PQBP1
;;NUCLEAR PROTEIN CONTAINING A WW DOMAIN, 38-KD; NPW38
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PQBP1 is a nuclear polyglutamine-binding protein that contains a WW
domain (Waragai et al., 1999).

CLONING

Using the polyglutamine tract of murine Brn2 (POU3F2; 600494) as bait in
a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human embryonic brain cDNA library, Imafuku
et al. (1998) cloned PQBP1. The deduced protein contains an arginine-
and aspartic acid-rich domain that assumes a helical structure. Northern
blot analysis confirmed expression of PQBP1 in human brain.

Waragai et al. (1999) further characterized PQBP1, which they had
previously cloned (Imafuku et al., 1998). The deduced 265-amino acid
PQBP1 protein contains an N-terminal WW domain, a protein-protein
interaction motif that has 2 conserved trp (W) residues, which lies
between an acidic region and an acidic-basic amino acid repetitive
region. PQBP1 also has a putative nuclear localization signal. Using
Northern blot analysis, Waragai et al. (1999) detected a 1.0-kb
transcript in all 8 tissues examined. Northern blot analysis and in situ
hybridization revealed PQBP1 in several regions of the brain, with
highest expression in cerebellum, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb.
Immunohistochemistry indicated that, in the brain, PQBP1 was present
primarily in neurons. By immunofluorescence studies and expression of a
PQBP1-GFP fusion protein, Waragai et al. (1999) showed that the PQBP1
protein localized in the nucleus.

By searching a full-length cDNA database for sequences encoding proteins
with protein-protein interaction domains, Komuro et al. (1999)
identified PQBP1, which they called NPW38. Using SDS-PAGE and Western
blot analysis, Komuro et al. (1999) showed that PQBP1 had an apparent
molecular mass of 38 kD. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.3-kb PQBP1
transcript in all 16 tissues examined.

Iwamoto et al. (2000) identified 4 alternative PQBP1 transcripts, which
they designated PQBP1a to PQBP1d, in addition to the PQBP1 transcript
identified by Komuro et al. (1999) and Waragai et al. (1999). All of the
PQBP1 transcripts encode proteins that retain the WW domain in their
N-terminal regions, but there is wide variation in their C-terminal
regions. Iwamoto et al. (2000) noted that PQBP1a and PQBP1d lack the
domain responsible for interaction with homopolymeric glutamine repeats
and the nuclear localization signal.

GENE FUNCTION

Using deletion analysis, Imafuku et al. (1998) showed that the arg- and
asp-rich motif of PQBP1 was essential for binding the polyglutamine
tract of mouse Brn2.

Waragai et al. (1999) proposed that PQBP1 mediates cellular functions by
binding to polyglutamine tracts via its polar amino acid-rich domain.
Using immunoprecipitation, they confirmed that PQBP1 binds mouse Brn2.
In cotransfection experiments, PQBP1 suppressed the ability of Brn2 to
transactivate a target gene. Waragai et al. (1999) noted that PQBP1
binds with a higher affinity to an expanded polyglutamine tract, and
they confirmed that PQBP1 interacts with the polyglutamine tracts of
huntingtin (613004) and androgen receptor (AR; 313700). Overexpression
of PQBP1 suppressed the growth of cells in culture and increased their
susceptibility to various stresses.

Komuro et al. (1999) observed that the WW domain of PQBP1 functioned as
a transcriptional activator in yeast 2-hybrid assays and in mammalian
cells in vivo. However, the transcriptional activity of the WW domain
was repressed by regions of PQBP1 flanking the WW domain. In vitro
translated PQBP1 specifically bound to poly(rG) resin, suggesting that
PQBP1 functions as an RNA-binding protein.

Okazawa et al. (2002) proposed that modified transcription may underlie
polyglutamine-mediated pathology and that PQBP1 may be involved in the
pathology of spinocerebellar ataxia-1 (SCA1; 164400). Using in vitro and
in vivo assays, they showed that interaction between ataxin-1 (ATX1;
601556) and PQBP1 was positively influenced by expanded polyglutamine
sequences. In immunoprecipitation experiments, mutant ataxin-1 enhanced
interaction between PQBP1 and the RNA polymerase II (pol II) large
subunit (180660), and the authors proposed that a ternary complex is
formed by PQBP1 in the presence of mutant ataxin-1. PQBP1 and mutant
ataxin-1 acted cooperatively in cell lines to repress transcription and
induce cell death. Okazawa et al. (2002) hypothesized that high
expression of PQBP1 in the cerebellum promotes mutant ataxin-1-induced
cell death, contributing to the region-specific neurodegeneration seen
in SCA1 patient tissues.

Enokido et al. (2002) examined the effects of PQBP1 on primary-cultured
cerebellar neurons and concluded that overexpression of PQBP1 inhibits
the basal transcription in cerebellar neurons and increases their
vulnerability to low potassium conditions.

GENE STRUCTURE

Iwamoto et al. (2000) determined that the PQBP1 gene contains 6 exons
and spans at least 4.6 kb.

MAPPING

Kalscheuer et al. (2003) stated that the PQBP1 gene maps to chromosome
Xp11.23.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Based on the distribution of linkage intervals in 125 unrelated families
with X-linked mental retardation (XLMR), Ropers et al. (2003) estimated
that one-third of all mutations underlying XLMR are clustered on
proximal Xp. In 5 of 29 families with XLMR, Kalscheuer et al. (2003)
identified mutations in the PQBP1 gene that caused frameshifts in the
fourth coding exon, which contains a stretch of 6 AG dinucleotides in
the DR/ER repeat. In 1 family not previously reported and a family with
Sutherland-Haan syndrome (309500), Kalscheuer et al. (2003) found that
affected males carried an extra AG dinucleotide (300463.0001). Two other
families, one not previously reported and the other reported as MRX55
(see 309500) by Deqaqi et al. (1998), had a deletion of 2 AG
dinucleotides (300463.0002). A single AG unit was deleted (300463.0003)
in affected males of a family that had been reported by Hamel et al.
(1994) as having mental retardation, congenital heart defect, cleft
palate, short stature, and facial anomalies. Considerable phenotypic
variability was observed between families with different mutations and
even between families with the same mutation.

In affected members of a Canadian Mennonite family with Renpenning
syndrome (309500), Lenski et al. (2004) identified a 1-bp insertion in
the PQBP1 gene (300463.0004). They commented that mental retardation,
microcephaly, and short stature seem to be consistent findings among
individuals with PQBP1 mutations. As microcephaly is the most common
physical finding among males with mental retardation of unknown cause,
and is a reliably ascertained finding, they suggested that it may be
useful in the selection of cases for PQBP1 mutation testing.

Golabi et al. (1984) reported a family with X-linked mental retardation,
microcephaly, postnatal growth deficiency, and other anomalies including
atrial septal defect. Lubs et al. (2006) restudied the family, but no
significant linkage to X chromosome markers could be found. Because
microcephaly, short stature, and atrial septal defect in the family of
Golabi et al. (1984) had a clinical similarity to families with other
X-linked mental retardation syndromes, including Renpenning syndrome, in
which mutations in PQBP1 had been identified, Lubs et al. (2006) did a
mutation screen of that gene. A missense mutation in PQBP1 was
identified that changed the conserved tyrosine residue in the WW domain
at position 65 to a cysteine (Y65C; 300463.0007).

ANIMAL MODEL

Okuda et al. (2003) generated transgenic mice overexpressing human
PQBP1. The mice showed a late-onset and gradually progressive motor
neuron disease-like phenotype suggestive of the neurogenic muscular
atrophy observed in patients with SCA1. Ataxia could not be
discriminated from predominant progressive weakness. Pathologic
examinations of the transgenic mice revealed loss of Purkinje and
granular cells in the cerebellum as well as loss of motor neurons in the
spinal anterior horn, corresponding to the pathology of human SCA1.
Okuda et al. (2003) concluded that excessive action of PQBP1 causes
neuronal dysfunction and that PQBP1 may be involved in the pathology of
SCA1.

Ito et al. (2009) generated Pqbp1-knockdown mice using a transgene
expressing double-strand RNA that is endogenously cleaved to an siRNA,
which inhibited 50% of Pqbp1 expression. Pqbp1-knockdown mice possessed
normal ability in ordinary memory tests including water-maze test,
whereas they showed abnormal anxiety-related behavior in light/dark
exploration test and open-field test, and showed obvious declines of
anxiety-related cognition in the repetitive elevated plus maze or novel
object recognition test. C-fos upregulation and histone H3 acetylation
after behavior tests were decreased in neurons of amygdala, prefrontal
cortex, and hippocampus. Administration of 4-phenylbutyric acid (PBA),
an HDAC inhibitor, efficiently improved expression of these genes and
rescued the abnormal phenotypes in adult Pqbp1-knockdown mice. Ito et
al. (2009) suggested that Pqbp1 dysfunction in regulating gene
expression may underlie the abnormal behavior and cognition of
Pqbp1-knockdown mice and that recovery of expression of such PQBP1
target genes might improve the symptoms in adult patients with
Renpenning syndrome and PQBP1-linked mental retardation.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RENPENNING SYNDROME
PQBP1, 2-BP INS, 3900AG

In all affected males from a family with an X-linked mental retardation
syndrome (309500) previously reported by Sutherland et al. (1988),
Kalscheuer et al. (2003) identified an insertion of an extra AG
dinucleotide at position 3900 of the PQBP1 gene. Affected males showed
mental retardation, short stature, microcephaly, brachycephaly, spastic
diplegia, small testes, and anal stenosis or atresia. Kalscheuer et al.
(2003) identified the same AG duplication in a second family with
X-linked mental retardation (see 309500), but the affected males showed
no spastic diplegia or small testes. In both families the disease was
not progressive.

.0002
RENPENNING SYNDROME
PQBP1, 4-BP DEL, 3896AGAG

In affected males of 2 families with X-linked mental retardation
(309500), Kalscheuer et al. (2003) identified a deletion of 2 AG
dinucleotides at position 3896 of the PQBP1 gene. The mutant protein was
predicted to differ by only 2 amino acids from the normal protein.
Affected individuals from 1 family, which had been reported as MRX55
(see 309500) by Deqaqi et al. (1998), were moderately retarded but had
no other clinical signs, except for a somewhat smaller body size in 1
individual. In contrast, all affected members of the second family,
which had not been reported previously, had microcephaly in addition to
mental retardation. One member also had anal atresia, and another had
complete situs inversus. Kalscheuer et al. (2003) suggested that this
clinical variability might be due to differences in the genetic
background; the mildly affected family was from Morocco, while the other
family was from the Netherlands. The disorder was not progressive in any
of these families.

In affected members and obligate carriers of a family with MRXS3,
previously described by Fichera et al. (2002), Fichera et al. (2005)
identified the 3896delAGAG mutation in the PQBP1 gene. The authors
observed skewed X inactivation in 8 of 9 heterozygous females in this
family; the inactivated X chromosome was of maternal origin.

In a family (K8600) with Renpenning syndrome, Stevenson et al. (2005)
identified a 4-bp deletion in exon 4 of the PQBP1 gene, which they
stated was identical to that previously identified by Kalscheuer et al.
(2003) in the MRX55 family, although Stevenson et al. (2005) denoted the
mutation as 459-462delAGAG. The deletion causes a frameshift and a
premature stop codon, resulting in a protein that partially lacks the
PRD domain and completely lacks the NLS and C2 domains. The deletion was
found in all affected males and obligate carriers.

.0003
RENPENNING SYNDROME
PQBP1, 2-BP DEL, 3898AG

In affected males from a family with an X-linked mental retardation
syndrome (309500) reported by Hamel et al. (1994), Kalscheuer et al.
(2003) identified a deletion of a single AG dinucleotide at position
3898 in the PQBP1 gene. All affected males had congenital heart defects
in addition to severe mental retardation, microcephaly, spasticity,
short stature, cleft or highly arched palate, and other craniofacial
abnormalities. The mother of 2 of the affected individuals had a
corrected atrial septal defect. Facial features coarsened with age.

Lenski et al. (2004) referred to this as the cerebropalatocardiac
syndrome or Hamel syndrome.

In 2 male cousins with right microphthalmia and left choroid coloboma,
microcephaly, mental retardation, renal hypoplasia, and spastic
diplegia, Martinez-Garay et al. (2007) identified a 2-bp deletion in the
PQBP1 gene that they designated 461delAG; they stated that it was the
same deletion previously reported by Kalscheuer et al. (2003). The
deletion was also found in both obligate carrier mothers; haplotype
analysis suggested germline mosaicism for the deletion in the maternal
grandmother.

.0004
RENPENNING SYNDROME
PQBP1, 1-BP INS, 641C

Renpenning et al. (1962) described a Canadian Mennonite family in which
20 males in 3 generations had mental retardation (309500).
Manifestations in affected males included microcephaly, short stature,
and small testes; carrier females appeared normal. Stevenson et al.
(1998) mapped the disorder in this family to Xp11.4-p11.2. In affected
members of this family, Lenski et al. (2004) identified a 1-bp insertion
in the PQBP1 gene, 641insC, resulting in a frameshift with a premature
stop codon.

.0005
RENPENNING SYNDROME
PQBP1, 23-BP DEL, NT547

In a French boy with X-linked mental retardation associated with
microcephaly, short stature, and hyperactivity (309500), Cossee et al.
(2006) identified a 23-bp deletion encompassing nucleotides 547-569 in
exon 4 of the PQBP1 gene, resulting in a frameshift and a truncated
PQPB1 protein lacking the NLS signal and the C2 domain. The same
mutation was identified in a maternal half-brother who had mild mental
retardation, microcephaly, short stature, facial dysmorphism, choanal
atresia, and anal imperforation.

.0006
RENPENNING SYNDROME
PQBP1, 21-BP DEL, NT334

In 3 unrelated boys with X-linked mental retardation (309500), Cossee et
al. (2006) identified a 21-bp in-frame deletion encompassing nucleotides
334 to 354 in exon 4 of the PQBP1 gene. Two of the boys had mild mental
retardation and mostly behavioral abnormalities without microcephaly or
short stature. The third boy had severe global developmental delay and
borderline short stature without microcephaly. The 21-bp deletion
affects a region of 5 imperfect 7-amino acid tandem repeats in the PRD
domain of the protein, present in the predominant isoform. The deletion
may not affect some of the rarer isoforms, and may not have drastic
functional effects, which may underlie the milder phenotype in these
patients.

.0007
RENPENNING SYNDROME
PQBP1, TYR65CYS

Lubs et al. (2006) identified a 194A-G transition, resulting in a
tyr65-to-cys (Y65C) substitution, in the PQBP1 gene in affected members
of a family with an X-linked mental retardation syndrome originally
described by Golabi et al. (1984) under the moniker 'Golabi-Ito-Hall
syndrome.' Features included microcephaly, postnatal growth deficiency,
and other anomalies, such as atrial septal defect, all of which are also
found in the Renpenning type of X-linked mental retardation (309500)
(Stevenson et al., 2005; Tapia et al., 2010). The Y65C substitution was
the first missense mutation identified in the PQBP1 gene and the first
mutation found in its WW domain. The WW domain had been shown to play an
important role in regulation of transcription by interacting with the
PPxY motif in transcription factors. The Y65C mutation was thought to
affect the proper functioning of the PQBP1 protein as a transcriptional
coactivator.

The highly conserved quartet of hydrophobic residues trp52, tyr65,
asn67, and pro78 of PQBP1 constitutes the core of its WW domain. Tapia
et al. (2010) found that the T65C substitution disturbed folding of the
isolated WW domain and rendered it vulnerable to oxidation and
dimerization compared with wildtype. The W65C mutant WW domain also
showed impaired binding to PPxY-containing peptides, and the full-length
mutant protein showed reduced binding to the mRNA splicing factor WBP11.
Consistent with these findings, lymphoblasts from a Golabi-Ito-Hall
syndrome patient showed more than 80% reduced splicing efficiency
compared with normal control cells. The T65C mutant protein did not show
reduced stability compared with wildtype, suggesting that it is not
recognized as a misfolded protein.
