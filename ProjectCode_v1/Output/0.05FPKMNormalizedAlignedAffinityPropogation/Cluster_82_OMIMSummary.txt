608735	TITLE *608735 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 39 (ZINC TRANSPORTER), MEMBER 13; SLC39A13
;;ZIP13;;
LZT-HS9
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Zinc is an essential cofactor for hundreds of enzymes. It is involved in
protein, nucleic acid, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism, as well as in
the control of gene transcription, growth, development, and
differentiation. SLC39A13 belongs to a subfamily of proteins that show
structural characteristics of zinc transporters (Taylor and Nicholson,
2003).

CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to a unique motif within
LIV1 (SLC39A6; 608731), Taylor and Nicholson (2003) identified SLC39A13,
which they designated LZT-Hs9. The deduced 364-amino acid protein
contains a long N terminus, followed by 8 putative transmembrane domains
and a short C terminus. It also has a high histidine content, including
a motif similar to the catalytic zinc-binding site of matrix
metalloproteases.

Using in situ hybridization, Fukada et al. (2008) found that Slc39a13
was highly expressed in mouse bone and eye. Slc39a13 was expressed in
osteoblasts of tibia and alveolar bone, in proliferative zone of growth
plate, in odontoblasts of the forming dentin crown in molar teeth, and
in fibroblasts of the reticular layer of skin. Immunohistochemical
analysis showed that Slc39a13 localized in the perinuclear region of
osteoblasts, chondrocytes, pulpal cells, and fibroblasts and was mainly
associated with the Golgi apparatus. Fukada et al. (2008) concluded that
SLC39A13 is expressed in cells essential for connective tissue
development.

Bin et al. (2011) noted that SLC39A13, which they called ZIP13, contains
an N-terminal pro-ala-leu (PAL) zinc-dependent processing site and a
his-glu-x-x-his (HExxH) zinc-binding motif, both of which are found in
the LZT family of zinc transporters. In ZIP13, the HExxH motif is
located within transmembrane domain 5. ZIP13 also has a putative
zinc-binding HN motif in transmembrane domain 4. Bin et al. (2011)
identified a a cleavable endoplasmic reticulum (ER) signal peptide
N-terminal to the PAL motif in ZIP13. Immunocytochemical analysis
revealed that ZIP13 colocalized with a Golgi marker and partially with
an ER marker. Protease accessibility experiments revealed that both the
N and C termini of ZIP13 were luminal.

MAPPING

Hartz (2004) mapped the SLC39A13 gene to chromosome 11p11.2 based on an
alignment of the SLC39A13 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK098651) with the
genomic sequence.

GENE FUNCTION

Using reducing and nonreducing SDS-PAGE, immunoprecipitation analysis,
and crosslinking experiments, Bin et al. (2011) showed that ZIP13 formed
homodimers. Overexpression of ZIP13 in HEK293 cells elevated
intracellular zinc content and caused upregulation of the gene encoding
metallothionein-1A (MT1A; 156350).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 6 affected members of 2 consanguineous families with a
spondylocheirodysplastic form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (612350), Giunta
et al. (2008) identified homozygosity for a 9-bp in-frame deletion in
exon 4 of the SLC39A13 gene (608735.0001).

Fukada et al. (2008) identified a homozygous loss-of-function mutation
in the SLC39A13 gene (G74D; 608735.0002) in 2 sibs with an Ehlers-Danlos
syndrome-like phenotype similar to that reported by Giunta et al.
(2008).

ANIMAL MODEL

Fukada et al. (2008) found that Slc39a13 -/- mice were growth retarded
and developed progressive kyphosis after 3 or 4 weeks of age. They
showed changes in bone, teeth, and connective tissue reminiscent of
human Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, with defects in the maturation of
osteoblasts, chondrocytes, odontoblasts, and fibroblasts. The
corresponding tissues and cells showed impaired bone morphogenic protein
(BMP; see 112264) and TGF-beta (TGFB1; 190180) signaling.

SLC39A13, 9-BP DEL, NT483

In 6 affected members of 2 consanguineous families with a
spondylocheirodysplastic form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (612350), Giunta
et al. (2008) identified homozygosity for a 9-bp in-frame deletion in
exon 4 of the SLC39A13 gene (483_491del9), resulting in the deletion of
3 amino acids (F162_164del) within the highly conserved transmembrane
domain III. All of the parents and several sibs were heterozygous for
the mutation, which was not found in 182 control individuals.

.0002
SPONDYLOCHEIRODYSPLASIA, EHLERS-DANLOS SYNDROME-LIKE
SLC39A13, GLY74ASP

In 2 sibs with the spondylocheirodysplastic form of Ehlers-Danlos
syndrome (612350), Fukada et al. (2008) identified a homozygous G-to-A
transition at nucleotide 221 in the SLC39A13 cDNA, resulting in a
nonconservative gly74-to-asp (G74D) substitution. G74 is located in the
second transmembrane domain of SLC39A13 and is conserved in vertebrates
from fish to humans.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Watanabe et al. (1996) isolated UBE2G1, which they designated UBE2G,
from a human fetal brain cDNA library. The cDNA encodes a deduced
170-amino acid protein. The predicted peptide product shares 74%
sequence identity with UBC7 of C. elegans, a high degree of homology
with UBC7s of other species, and significant homologies with other
subgroups of UBCs. Northern blot analysis revealed strong expression of
transcripts of 3 sizes in skeletal muscle. Weak expression was observed
in 15 other tissues examined.

MAPPING

Watanabe (2000) confirmed the mapping of a BAC (GenBank GENBANK
AC012479) containing most exons of the UBE2G gene to chromosome 17 by
radiation hybrid mapping using 2 primer sets designed from the BAC
sequence. By screening a human monochromosomal somatic cell hybrid panel
with 3 distinct primers designed from UBE2G cDNA sequences, they further
confirmed this localization. Watanabe (2000) stated that a previous
mapping of the UBE2G gene to 1q42 was in error and may have represented
the mapping of a pseudogene.

;;B-CELL ANTIGEN CD22;;
SIALIC ACID-BINDING IMMUNOGLOBULIN-LIKE LECTIN 2; SIGLEC2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The human B-lymphocyte-restricted antigen CD22 is expressed early in
B-cell development in pro-B cells, as a cytoplasmic protein, and later
in B-cell development, at the late pre-B-cell stage, as a cell surface
protein. Once expressed as a membrane protein, CD22 persists on B cells
until they differentiate into plasma cells. The presence of cytoplasmic
CD22 is a useful marker for B-cell precursor acute lymphocytic leukemia.
CD22 appears to be a heterodimer consisting of 130- and 140-kD
glycoproteins with protein cores of 80 and 100 kD, respectively. The 2
subunits are thought to be independently transported to the surface and
originate from 2 separate precursor molecules. Studies of the structure
of the 2 proteins and cDNA cloning suggested that the 2 proteins arise
from differential RNA processing of the same gene, with the larger
subunit being composed of an extracellular portion of 7 immunoglobulin
domains, 1 V-like and 6 C-like, and a smaller subunit of 5 Ig domains, 1
V-like and 4 C-like. The CD22 polypeptide is structurally related to
myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG; 159460), neural cell adhesion
molecule (NCAM; 116930), and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA; 114890).
Consistent with the structural similarities to the adhesion molecules,
CD22 participates in adhesion between B cells and other cell types.
Wilson et al. (1991) cloned a full-length cDNA corresponding to the
B-cell membrane protein CD22.

GENE FUNCTION

Nonhuman mammalian cells express N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and
N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc). Human cells contain only Neu5Ac
because of an exon deletion/frameshift mutation in cytidine
monophospho-sialic acid hydroxylase (CMAH; 603209), which converts
Neu5Ac to Neu5Gc. Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins, or
SIGLECs, such as CD22 (SIGLEC2), recognize sialic acids. Brinkman-Van
der Linden et al. (2000) showed that human SIGLEC1 (SN; 600751) strongly
prefers Neu5Ac over Neu5Gc. Sequence analysis of SIGLEC2 cDNA found that
while the chimpanzee sequence is 97% homologous to human, bonobo and
gorilla are only 96% homologous, and the orangutan is only 93%
homologous. Using regions of SIGLEC2 proteins from mouse, chimpanzee,
orangutan, and human fused to the Fc region of human IgG, and flow
cytometry analysis, Brinkman-Van der Linden et al. (2000) showed that
all bound well to chimpanzee Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B
cells, which expressed high levels of Neu5Gc. Except for mouse, all
bound well to human EBV-transformed B cells, which expressed high levels
of Neu5Ac.

In a review of immune inhibitory receptors, Ravetch and Lanier (2000)
pointed out that autoimmune disorders may result from the disruption of
inhibitory receptors, particularly in their conserved intracellular
immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs). ITIMs are sites
for alternative phosphorylation, typically by a Src kinase, and
dephosphorylation, either by the tyrosine phosphatase SHP1 (176883) or
the inositol phosphatase SHIP (601582), transducing signals to distinct
pathways. Ravetch and Lanier (2000) noted that CD22 has ITIMs that
interact with SHP1 and oppose activation mediated by the B cell
receptor.

Using murine B-cell lines, Wakabayashi et al. (2002) demonstrated that
CD22 downmodulates signaling through the IgM and IgD B-cell receptors
(BCRs), but not through the IgG BCR, because the IgG cytoplasmic tail
prevents CD22 phosphorylation and actually enhances IgG-BCR signaling.
Wakabayashi et al. (2002) proposed that enhanced IgG-BCR signaling may
be involved in efficient IgG production, which is crucial for protective
immunity against pathogens.

Using yeast 2-hybrid and coprecipitation analyses, John et al. (2003)
found that tyr843 or tyr863 in the cytoplasmic tail of CD22 interacted
with AP50 (AP2M1; 601024), the medium chain subunit of the AP2 complex.
Studies on B cells showed that internalization of CD22 was dependent on
its association with the AP2 complex via tyrosine-based internalization
motifs.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wilson et al. (1993) used a nearly full-length cDNA clone of CD22 to
isolate genomic clones that spanned the gene. The gene covers 22 kb of
DNA and comprises 15 exons.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Wilson et al. (1993) showed that
the CD22 locus is located within band 19q13.1.

ANIMAL MODEL

O'Keefe et al. (1996) made observations in mice with a targeted
disruption of the CD22 gene indicating that CD22 is a negative regulator
of antigen receptor signaling whose onset of expression at the mature B
cell stage may serve to raise the antigen concentration threshold
required for B cell triggering. Splenic B cells from CD22 knockout mice
were found to be hyperresponsive to receptor signaling. Heightened
calcium fluxes and cell proliferation were obtained at lower ligand
concentrations. The mice gave augmented immune response, had an expanded
peritoneal B-1 cell population, and contained increased serum titers of
autoantibody.

Chen et al. (2004) expressed mouse Cd22 in mouse and chicken B-cell
lines devoid of Cd22 and examined B cells from mice deficient in Cd22 or
Pmca4 (108732). They identified an activation-dependent interaction
between phosphorylated Cd22 and Pmca4 and found that Cd22 together with
Shp1 (PTPN6; 176883) provided negative control of B-cell activation by
enhancing Pmca4-mediated calcium efflux after B-cell receptor
stimulation.

;;RIBONUCLEASE H2, LARGE SUBUNIT;;
RIBONUCLEASE HI, LARGE SUBUNIT;;
RNase HI, LARGE SUBUNIT
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ribonuclease (RNase) H enzymes specifically cleave ribonucleotides from
RNA:DNA duplexes. Two classes of RNase H exist: type 1 (I) and 2 (II).
RNase H2 is the major source of RNase H activity in mammalian cells and
yeast. The protein complex is proposed to function in the removal of
lagging-strand Okazaki fragment RNA primers during DNA replication and
in the excision of single ribonucleotides from DNA:DNA duplexes. See
also RNASEH2B (610326) and RNASEH2C (610330). The 3 homologs in S.
cerevisiae are known as Rnh2Ap, Rnh2Bp, and RNh2Cp, respectively (Crow
et al., 2006).

CLONING

By biochemical purification of the 32-kD subunit of calf thymus RNase
HI, microsequence analysis, EST database searching, and PCR with
degenerate primers on an erythroleukemia cDNA library, Frank et al.
(1998) obtained a cDNA encoding the large subunit of human RNase HI. The
deduced 299-amino acid protein appeared to lack RNA- and DNA-binding
domains. Genomic database comparisons revealed homologies between the
large subunit of mammalian RNase HI and prokaryotic RNase HII. Western
blot analysis showed expression of a 33-kD recombinant protein, close to
the predicted size. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.2-kb transcript
in a kidney cell line.

GENE STRUCTURE

The RNASEH2A gene contains 8 exons (Crow et al., 2006).

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the
RNASEH2A gene to chromosome 19 (TMAP stSG4402).

Crow et al. (2006) refined the mapping of the RNASEH2A gene to 19p13.13.

GENE FUNCTION

RNase HI is involved in DNA replication and participates with FEN1
(600393) in DNA repair. The smaller RNase HII is associated with
transcription (Frank et al., 1998).

By transient expression in HEK293T cells, Crow et al. (2006) showed that
the human RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, and RNASEH2C genes interact with each
other and form an enzymatic protein complex with RNase H2 activity. The
complex was able to recognize and cleave a single ribonucleotide
embedded in a DNA-DNA complex.

RNase H2 is specialized to remove single ribonucleotides (ribonucleoside
monophosphates, or rNMPs) from duplex DNA, and its absence in budding
yeast has been associated with the accumulation of deletions within
short tandem repeats. Kim et al. (2011) demonstrated that
rNMP-associated deletion formation requires the activity of Top1
(126420), a topoisomerase that relaxes supercoils by reversibly nicking
duplex DNA. The reported studies extended the role of Top1 to include
the processing of rNMPs in genomic DNA into irreversible single-strand
breaks, an activity that can have distinct mutagenic consequences and
may be relevant to human disease.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 children with Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome (AGS4; 610333) from a
consanguineous family of Spanish ancestry reported by Sanchis et al.
(2005), Crow et al. (2006) identified a homozygous mutation in the
RNASEH2A gene (606034.0001).

Rice et al. (2007) found RNASEH2A mutations in 3 of 127 pedigrees with a
clinical diagnosis of AGS. Four children in these 3 families had
biallelic mutations. Four of 5 mutations, 1 of which occurred in
homozygous form, were missense. In 1 family Rice et al. (2007)
identified a single mutation in RNASEH2A that had been inherited.

Rice et al. (2013) studied 4 probands with AGS who had homozygous or
compound heterozygous mutations in the RNASEH2A gene
(606034.0002-606034.0006). All 4 patients carried at least 1 synonymous
RNASEH2A mutation; functional analysis confirmed the pathogenicity of
the synonymous mutations.

In 2 brothers with Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome-4 (AGS4; 610333) from a
consanguineous family of Spanish ancestry reported by Sanchis et al.
(2005), Crow et al. (2006) identified a homozygous 109G-A transition in
exon 1 of the RNASEH2A gene, resulting in a gly37-to-ser (G37S)
substitution at the end of the first beta-sheet in the floor of the
predicted substrate-binding cleft near the catalytic site. This amino
acid is conserved across all 3 major phylogenetic divisions (archea,
eubacteria, eukaryotes). In vitro functional expression studies showed
that the G37S mutant protein resulted in markedly reduced protein
activity. The mutation was not detected in 178 European control alleles,
and both parents were heterozygous for the mutation.

AICARDI-GOUTIERES SYNDROME 4
RNASEH2A, ARG25ARG

In a 7-year-old Belgian girl with Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome-4 (610333),
Rice et al. (2013) identified homozygosity for a c.75C-T transition in
exon 1 of the RNASEH2A gene, resulting in an arg25-to-arg (R25R)
substitution. Her unaffected parents were heterozygous for the variant.
The mutation was predicted to create a new donor splice site within exon
1; sequencing of the smaller RT-PCR product obtained from patient cell
lines confirmed preferential usage of the new donor splice site. The
aberrant transcript had a 54-bp in-frame deletion, resulting in an
18-amino acid internal deletion (del26-43) in the RNASEH2A protein.
Coexpression of the mutant RNASEH2A with the B and C subunits in E. coli
showed that although a mutant trimeric complex was formed, it exhibited
no detectable catalytic activity, consistent with the loss of key
metal-binding residues asp34 and glu35 in the mutant enzyme. However, a
small amount of full-length transcript was also detected and confirmed
by quantitative RT-PCR analysis of patient cells and peripheral whole
blood, and residual levels of cellular RNase H2 activity were confirmed
using a fluorometric assay on whole cell lysates from patient
fibroblasts and lymphoblastoid cells.

In a 12-year-old Spanish girl with Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome-4 (610333)

heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the RNASEH2A gene: a synonymous R25R
substitution (606034.0002), and a c.704G-A transition in exon 7,
resulting in an arg235-to-gln (R235Q) substitution at a highly conserved
residue. Their unaffected parents were each heterozygous for 1 of the
mutations. Coffin et al. (2011) performed kinetic analysis of wildtype
and R235Q mutant RNASEH2A and observed that the mutant showed
dramatically reduced activity, measured at 1/370, 1/600, and 1/750
relative to wildtype, as well as reduced binding affinity, measured at
1/4, 1/4, and 1/10 relative to wildtype, using polynucleotide substrates
containing 1, 4, and 20 ribonucleotides, respectively. Catalytic
efficiency with the R235Q mutant was 1/800 of the efficiency of the
wildtype protein.

RNASEH2A, VAL23VAL

In an Italian boy with Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome-4 (610333) who died at
3.5 years of age, Rice et al. (2013) identified compound heterozygosity
for 2 mutations in the RNASEH2A gene. The first mutation was a c.69G-A
transition in exon 1, resulting in a val23-to-val (V23V) substitution
and predicted to create a new donor splice site; sequencing confirmed an
out-of-frame deletion and insertion of 20 amino acids followed by a
premature stop codon at residue 42. The second mutation was a c.556C-T
transition in exon 6, resulting in an arg186-to-trp (R186W; 606034.0005)
substitution at a highly conserved residue. His unaffected parents were
each heterozygous for 1 of the mutations. Coffin et al. (2011) performed
kinetic analysis of wildtype and R186W mutant RNASEH2A and observed that
the mutant showed dramatically reduced activity, measured at 1/160, 1/9,
and 1/8 relative to wildtype, as well as reduced binding affinity,
measured at 1/8, 1/25, and 1/100 relative to wildtype, using
polynucleotide substrates containing 1, 4, and 20 ribonucleotides,
respectively. Catalytic efficiency with the R186W mutant was 1/56 of the
efficiency of the wildtype protein.

mutations in the RNASEH2A gene: a synonymous V23V mutation
(606034.0004), and a c.635A-T transversion in exon 6, resulting in an
asn212-to-ile (N212I) substitution at a conserved residue. His
unaffected parents were each heterozygous for 1 of the mutations. RNase
H2 enzyme activity was strongly reduced in cell lysates from the
patient, whereas enzyme activity in parental cells was similar to
control levels. Coffin et al. (2011) performed kinetic analysis of
wildtype and N212I mutant RNASEH2A and observed that although activity
and catalytic efficiency were comparable to wildtype, the mutant showed
reduced binding affinity, measured at 1/2 and 1/3 relative to wildtype,
using polynucleotide substrates containing 4 and 20 ribonucleotides,
respectively.

;;URACIL-DNA GLYCOSYLASE 2; UNG2; UDG2;;
URACIL-DNA GLYCOSYLASE, CYCLIN-LIKE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using antibodies directed to uracil-DNA glycosylase purified from HeLa
cells, Muller and Caradonna (1991) cloned UDG2 cDNA from a Jurkat T-cell
expression library. The deduced 327-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 35.4 kD. Muller and Caradonna (1991) noted that UDG2
shares no significant amino acid homology with human UNG (191525) or
with uracil-DNA glycosylases from yeast, E. coli, or herpes simplex
virus. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.6-kb transcript in HeLa
cells. Western blot analysis detected a 36-kD protein in human
fibroblasts and placenta and in monkey kidney cells, but not in hamster
ovary or mouse fibroblasts.

Muller and Caradonna (1993) determined that UDG2 shares significant
homology with the conserved cyclin box region of several cyclins,
including human cyclin A (CCNA2; 123835).

By immunohistochemical analysis of 3 human cell lines, Caradonna et al.
(1996) found that UDG2 localized exclusively in the nucleus.

GENE FUNCTION

Muller and Caradonna (1991) determined that in vitro translated UDG2
showed significant uracil-DNA glycosylase activity. However, Caradonna
(2006) noted that the activity of in vitro translated UDG2 was not as
robust as that of the mitochondrial isoform of UNG.

Muller and Caradonna (1993) found that transcription of UDG2 mRNA
increased 2- to 3-fold during the G1 phase of the cell cycle in both
HeLa cells and human lung fibroblasts. By gel shift assays of cells
prepared from various stages of the cell cycle, they demonstrated that a
repressor element in the promoter formed several specific DNA complexes
during S and G2 phases that were not present during M and G1 phases. Two
of the complexes resulted from binding to an inverted cell cycle box
(CCB). Immunoprecipitation studies revealed that UDG2 protein levels
increased during G1 phase and that the protein turned over during the
course of 1 cell cycle.

GENE STRUCTURE

Muller and Caradonna (1993) determined that the CCNO gene contains 2
exons and spans about 4.2 kb. The promoter region contains 2 CCB
regulatory elements. Deletion analysis revealed a repressor region that
contains an inverted CCB and an SP1 (189906)-like binding region.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis, Muller and Caradonna (1991) mapped the
CCNO gene to chromosome 5.

605929	TITLE *605929 SORTING NEXIN 2; SNX2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SNX2 is a member of the sorting nexin family of molecules that contain
an approximately 100-amino acid region termed the phox homology (PX)
domain (Haft et al., 1998).

CLONING

By database searching with the sequence of sorting nexin-1 (SNX1;
601272), Haft et al. (1998) obtained several human EST clones,
determined their nucleotide sequences, and constructed full-length cDNAS
corresponding to an isoform of SNX1 (SNX1A), SNX2, SNX3 (605930), and
SNX4 (605931). The SNX2 cDNA encodes a deduced 519-amino acid protein
that shares 63% sequence identity with SNX1. Northern blot analysis
detected SNX2 transcripts of approximately 3.1 and 2.4 kb in all tissues
tested, with highest expression in spleen, heart, skeletal muscle, and
peripheral leukocytes, and low expression in kidney, liver, and brain.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SNX2
gene to chromosome 5q23 (TMAP stSG21976).

GENE FUNCTION

By Western blot analysis, Haft et al. (1998) showed that SNX1, SNX1A,
SNX2, and SNX4 are associated predominantly with membranes, whereas SNX3
is found mainly in the cytosol. SNX2 is able to oligomerize with itself
and forms heteromeric complexes with SNX1, SNX1A, and SNX4, but not with
SNX3. When expressed in COS-7 cells, epitope-tagged SNX1, SNX1A, SNX2,
and SNX4 coimmunoprecipitated with receptor tyrosine kinases for EGF
(131550), platelet-derived growth factor (see 173490), and insulin
(147670). They also associated with the long isoform of the leptin
receptor (601007) but not with the short and medium isoforms. Based on
the functions of their yeast homologs, Haft et al. (1998) suggested that
mammalian sorting nexins function in intracellular trafficking of
proteins to various organelles.

The cell surface receptor CED1 (107770) mediates apoptotic cell
recognition by phagocytic cells, enabling cell corpse clearance in C.
elegans. Chen et al. (2010) found that the C. elegans intracellular
protein sorting complex, retromer, was required for cell corpse
clearance by mediating the recycling of CED1. The mammalian retromer
complex contains sorting nexins 1 and 2 (C. elegans homolog snx1) and
5/6 (605937, 606098) (C. elegans homolog snx6). Retromer was recruited
to the surfaces of phagosomes containing cell corpses, and its loss of
function caused defective cell corpse removal. The retromer probably
acted through direct interaction with CED1 in the cell corpse
recognition pathway. In the absence of retromer function, CED1
associated with lysosomes and failed to recycle from phagosomes and
cytosol to the plasma membrane. Thus, Chen et al. (2010) concluded that
retromer is an essential mediator of apoptotic cell clearance by
regulating phagocytic receptor(s) during cell corpse engulfment.

610123	TITLE *610123 5-@HYDROXYTRYPTAMINE RECEPTOR 3, SUBUNIT E; HTR3E
;;SEROTONIN 5-HT-3E RECEPTOR
DESCRIPTION For background information on the serotonin (5-HT) receptor gene family,
see 182131.

CLONING

The serotonin receptor 5-HT3 is an oligomeric complex composed of 5
subunits. Using BLAST analysis with a consensus sequence derived from
HTR3A (182139) and HTR3B (604654), Niesler et al. (2003) identified and
subsequently cloned 2 novel homologous genes, HTR3D and HTR3E. The HTR3E
gene encodes a predicted protein of 471 amino acids including a 16-amino
acid signal sequence, 4 transmembrane domains, and several potential
glycosylation and phosphorylation sites. Sequence comparisons showed
that HTR3C, HTR3D, and HTR3E share amino acid sequence identities of
64.8 to 74.3%; multiple sequence alignments suggested that HTR3C
(610121), HTR3D (610122), and HTR3E share a common evolutionary history,
whereas HTR3A and HTR3B are evolutionarily more distant. RT-PCR analysis
showed HTR3E expression only in adult colon and intestine.

Karnovsky et al. (2003) identified HTR3E and showed using RT-PCR that 2
alternative first exons are used, encoding predicted proteins of either
456 or 471 amino acids. HTR3E contains 6 proline residues necessary for
normal 5-HT3 receptor function. RT-PCR showed very strong expression in
small intestine and weak expression in spinal cord and retina. HTR3E is
also expressed in the human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines SW480
and differentiated Caco-2. Southern blot analyses of zooblots showed
HTR3E hybridization to human, dog, cow, pig, rabbit, and chicken genomic
DNA, but not to mouse or rat genomic DNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Using in situ hybridization, Kapeller et al. (2008) observed
colocalization of HTR3E with microRNA-510 (MIR510; 610123) in
enterocytes of colonic mucosa and in myenteric plexus. They identified
an MIR510-binding site in the 3-prime UTR of the HTR3E gene. Following
transfection of Colo320 cells, MIR510 downregulated expression of a
reporter gene that included the HTR3E 3-prime UTR in a dose-dependent
manner. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that MIR510 binding did not
affect the stability of HTR3E mRNA, suggesting that MIR510 repressed
HTR3E expression at the translational level.

GENE STRUCTURE

Karnovsky et al. (2003) reported that the HTR3E gene contains 9 exons
spanning at least 7.7 kb. They also found an additional alternative
first exon that includes exon 2 and 112 nucleotides between exons 1 and
2.

MAPPING

Niesler et al. (2003) mapped the HTR3E gene to chromosome 3q27 by FISH.
PCR and hybridization analysis showed that HTR3E, HTR3C, and HTR3D form
a cluster and map within a 100-kb region.

612419	TITLE *612419 CARTILAGE INTERMEDIATE LAYER PROTEIN 2; CILP2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to CILP1 (CILP; 603489),
followed by screening an osteoarthritic joint cartilage chondrocyte cDNA
library, Johnson et al. (2003) cloned full-length CILP2. The deduced
CILP2 protein shares 50.6% identity with CILP1, and both proteins have a
central furin (FUR; 136950) endoprotease consensus cleavage site
predicted to cause release of N- and C-terminal peptides. The N-terminal
halves of CILP1 and CILP2 contain a thrombospondin (see 188060) type-1
repeat and an immunoglobulin C2-type domain, but the N-terminal half of
CILP2 lacks the putative aldehyde dehydrogenase (see 100640) cysteine
active site and the ATP-binding site found in CILP1. RT-PCR analysis
detected both CILP1 and CILP2 in cultured normal hyaline cartilage
articular chondrocytes, but not in osteoblasts, fibroblasts, or vascular
smooth muscle cells. Only CILP1 was detected in normal knee meniscal
fibrocartilage chondrocytic cells.

Bernardo et al. (2011) showed that mouse Cilp2 mRNA is distributed at
the surface of the articular cartilage during development and localizes
to the intermediate zone of articular cartilage and meniscal cartilage
with maturity. The Cilp2 protein is more localized in the deeper
intermediate zone of the articular cartilage than Cilp1. The human CILP2
protein was found in articular cartilage and shown to be proteolytically
processed and N-glycosylated. Bernardo et al. (2011) found that Cilp2
protein was reduced in mouse osteoarthritic cartilage. RT-PCR analysis
detected Cilp1 and Cilp2 transcripts in heart and skeletal muscle,
indicating that these genes are not exclusively expressed by
chondrocytes.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Johnson et al. (2003) mapped the CILP2
gene to chromosome 9p13.11. However, Gross (2012) mapped the CILP2 gene
to chromosome 19p13.11 based on an alignment of the CILP2 sequence
(GenBank GENBANK AF542080) with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

613333	TITLE *613333 MEMBRANE-ASSOCIATED RING-CH FINGER PROTEIN 3; MARCH3
;;MARCH III
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MARCH3 is a member of the MARCH family of membrane-bound E3 ubiquitin
ligases (EC 6.3.2.19). MARCH proteins add ubiquitin (see 191339) to
target lysines in substrate proteins, thereby signaling their vesicular
transport between membrane compartments. MARCH3 appears to function in
the endosomal recycling pathway (Fukuda et al., 2006).

CLONING

Poxviruses and gamma-2 herpesviruses express ubiquitin ligases called K3
proteins that inhibit the surface expression of glycoproteins, including
major histocompatibility complex class I molecules (see 142800). By
searching a database for sequences similar to the functional domains of
viral K3 proteins, Bartee et al. (2004) identified 9 human MARCH
proteins, including MARCH3. The deduced MARCH3 protein contains a short
N terminus, followed by a RING-CH domain and 2 transmembrane domains.
MARCH3 shares about 60% identity with MARCH2 (613332) in the RING-CH and
transmembrane domains. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that
epitope-tagged MARCH3 colocalized with a marker for endocytic or
lysosomal vesicles.

Using RT-PCR, De Gassart et al. (2008) detected variable MARCH3
expression in all human cells and cell lines examined, including
immature and mature dendritic cells, HeLa and B-cell lines, and
monocytes.

Using Northern blot analysis, Fukuda et al. (2006) detected variable
March3 expression in all rat tissues examined. Immunofluorescence
microscopy detected endogenous MARCH3 in HeLa cells, where it partly
colocalized with transferrin receptor (TFRC; 190010), an early endosome
marker.

GENE FUNCTION

Fukuda et al. (2006) showed that the RING-CH finger domain of rat March3
functioned as an E3 ubiquitin ligase in an in vitro ubiquitination
reaction. Overexpression of March3 in HeLa cells caused mislocalization
of TGN46 (TGOLN2; 603062), an endosome protein that normally cycles
between the plasma membrane and the trans-Golgi network (TGN), from the
TGN to peripheral vesicles. Overexpression of March3 also interfered
with uptake of transferrin (TF; 190000) through the endosomal recycling
pathway. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that epitope-tagged March3
interacted with March2 and with syntaxin-6 (STX6; 603944). Deletion of
the C-terminal class I PDZ-binding motif caused accumulation of March3
in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), suggesting that the PDZ-binding
sequence is necessary for proper exit from the ER. Mutation analysis
also showed that 2 critical cysteines within the RING-CH domain of
March3 were necessary for targeting of March3 to peripheral vesicles.

MAPPING

Hartz (2010) mapped the MARCH3 gene to chromosome 5q23.2 based on an
alignment of the MARCH3 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF055007) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Patients with autosomal dominant adult-onset leukodystrophy (ADLD;
169500) have been found to have a duplication on chromosome 5 that
includes all of the LMNB1 gene (150340) and part of the MARCH3 gene (see
150340.0001).

605703	TITLE *605703 VESICLE-ASSOCIATED MEMBRANE PROTEIN-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN A; VAPA
;;VAMP-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN A;;
VAMP-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN, 33-KD; VAP33
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SNAREs (see 603215) are compartmentally specific, cytoplasmically
oriented integral membrane proteins involved in the fusion of membranes
and the transport of intracellular proteins. Recognition of vesicles and
target membranes is mediated by v-SNAREs (e.g., VAMP8; 603177) and
t-SNAREs (e.g., SNAP23; 602534), respectively.

CLONING

By searching an EST database for human homologs of the Aplysia 33-kD
VAMP-associated protein (Vap33), Weir et al. (1998) identified a cDNA
encoding VAPA, which they termed VAP33. Sequence analysis predicted that
the 242-amino acid protein, which is 50% identical to the molluscan
sequence, contains 8 potential phosphorylation sites, an alpha-helical
coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal transmembrane domain. Northern blot
analysis of mouse tissues detected a major 1.9-kb transcript and minor
3.9- and 7.1-kb transcripts in all tissues tested, with highest
expression in brain, testis, ovary, kidney and skeletal muscle. In
contrast, Vap33 expression is neuron specific in Aplysia.

Nishimura et al. (1999) identified cDNAs encoding VAPA and the 60%
homologous VAPB (605704). Northern blot analysis detected a 1.7-kb VAPA
transcript in all human tissues tested.

GENE FUNCTION

By Western blot analysis, Weir et al. (1998) showed that VAPA interacts
with VAMP1 (185880) and VAMP2 (185881) but not with SNAP25 (600322).

By SDS-PAGE analysis, Nishimura et al. (1999) demonstrated that the
transmembrane domain of recombinant VAPA interacted with VAPA and VAPB
fusion proteins.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the VAPA
gene to chromosome 18 (TMAP stSG49693).

614360	TITLE *614360 ACYL-CoA SYNTHETASE MEDIUM CHAIN FAMILY, MEMBER 4; ACSM4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Fatty acids are incorporated into membranes and signaling molecules and
have roles in energy storage and metabolism. These essential functions
require activation of the fatty acid by acyl-coenzyme A (CoA)
synthetases, such as ACSM4, which form an activating thioester linkage
between the fatty acid and CoA (Watkins et al., 2007).

CLONING

By searching databases for sequences containing acyl-CoA synthetase
motifs 1 and 2, Watkins et al. (2007) identified human ACSM4. The
deduced 580-amino acid protein contains 4 of 5 motifs characteristic of
acyl-CoA synthetases. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that ACSM4 belongs
to a family of medium chain acyl-CoA synthetases.

GENE STRUCTURE

Watkins et al. (2007) determined that the ACSM4 gene contains 13 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Watkins et al. (2007) mapped the ACSM4
gene to the plus strand of chromosome 12p13.31.

171790	TITLE *171790 PHOSPHATASE, PROSTATE-SPECIFIC ACID; ACPP
;;PROSTATIC ACID PHOSPHATASE; PAP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Yeh et al. (1987) reported the cloning of a cDNA from a human liver
library using polyclonal antiserum to human acid phosphatase isoenzyme
2a/4. This isoenzyme is the major phosphatase of the human prostate.

Sharief et al. (1989) isolated and sequenced cDNA clones encoding human
prostatic acid phosphatase from a prostatic cDNA expression library
established from benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Tailor et al. (1990) reported the complete coding sequence of the ACPP
gene. The open reading frame encoded a protein of 342 amino acid
residues with a calculated molecular weight of about 50,000 daltons.

GENE FUNCTION

In a phase I clinical vaccine trial in 21 patients with metastatic
prostate cancer using autologous dendritic cells pulsed with xenogeneic
mouse Pap, Fong et al. (2001) observed minimal side effects and
ubiquitous T-cell immunity to Pap. Th1-type T-cell immune responses to
homologous self-antigen PAP developed in 11 subjects. In addition to
safety and immunogenicity, Fong et al. (2001) found that 6 of the
patients had evidence of disease stabilization lasting for more than 1
year after the 2 monthly vaccinations, as determined by serum PSA
levels, computed tomography, and bone scans. The development of a
PAP-specific T-cell response correlated with an increase in disease
progression-free survival. Fong et al. (2001) concluded that
immunization with xenogeneic antigens, which are different enough to
represent 'altered self,' is superior to poorly immunogenic self
antigens in inducing an antitumor response.

By screening a peptide/protein seminal fluid library, Munch et al.
(2007) identified fragments of PAP that strongly enhanced human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV; see 609423) infection. The peptide
fragments formed amyloid fibrils that captured HIV particles and
increased the number of productively infected T cells, macrophages, and
tonsillar tissue, as well as transinfected T cells that obtained virus
from dendritic or epithelial cells, by promoting viral attachment and
fusion. Munch et al. (2007) concluded that amyloidogenic PAP fragments
are abundant in seminal fluid and drastically enhance HIV infection.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sharief and Li (1992) determined the nucleotide sequence of the 10 exons
and their flanking regions. The positions of all 9 introns in the ACPP
gene were homologous to those of the first 9 introns in the lysosomal
acid phosphatase gene (171650). The eleventh exon of the lysosomal acid
phosphatase gene encoding the COOH-terminal domain, which includes a
transmembrane segment, was found to be absent in the ACPP gene. Sharief
and Li (1992) concluded that the total length of the ACPP gene is at
least 50 kb. Sharief and Li (1994) reported a partial nucleotide
sequence of ACPP including 7 Alu repeats, of which 3 were located
immediately upstream of exon 1 and another was identified in intron 1.

MAPPING

Winqvist et al. (1989) used a cDNA probe for prostate-specific acid
phosphatase to assign the gene to chromosome 3 by Southern blot analysis
of human/mouse somatic cell hybrid DNAs. Sublocalization of the gene was
performed using hybrids that had retained only portions of human
chromosome 3. The gene was found to segregate specifically with the
segment 3q21-qter. Sharief et al. (1989) confirmed the assignment to
chromosome 3 by means of sorted human chromosome spot-blot hybridization
to their cDNA probe. Li and Sharief (1993) assigned the ACPP gene to
chromosome 3 by probing a panel of 25 human/Chinese hamster somatic cell
hybrids and further localized the gene to 3q21-q23 by fluorescence in
situ hybridization.

300092	TITLE *300092 TESTIS-EXPRESSED GENE 28; TEX28
;;CHROMOSOME X OPEN READING FRAME 2; CXORF2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Hanna et al. (1997) analyzed ESTs from a variety of human cDNA libraries
and identified a sequence identical to intergenic regions of the red
(RCP, or OPN1LW; 300822) and green (GCP, or OPN1MW; 300821) color
pigment gene cluster. The EST was derived from a testis cDNA clone. The
longest open reading frame encodes a polypeptide of 410 amino acids. A
1.8-kb transcript of the gene, which the authors called TEX28, was
detected in testis, but not in other tissues examined.

Using PCR, Chen et al. (2006) detected high expression of TEX28 in
testis and marginal expression in prostate, spleen, brain, breast,
pancreas, and placenta.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hanna et al. (1997) determined that the TEX28 gene contains 5 exons and
spans at least 96% of the 25.5 kb between the GCP and transketolase-2
(TKTL1; 300044) genes. It is transcribed in the orientation opposite to
GCP and TKTL1.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Hanna et al. (1997) mapped the TEX28 gene
between the GCP and TKTL1 genes on chromosome Xq28. They determined that
TEX28 is repeated multiple times within the color pigment gene array on
chromosome Xq28, but exclusion of exon 1 from the duplicative copies
suggested that transcription is restricted to the copy between the GCP
and TKTL1 genes. Hanna et al. (1997) suggested that color vision
disorders that result from deletion of the color pigment genes should be
reappraised for possible associated phenotypes that might derive from
disruption of the TEX28 gene.

Chen et al. (2006) determined that there are 3 exact copies of the TEX28
gene on chromosome Xq28.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Metlapally et al. (2009) used array CGH to study copy number variation
(CNV) in 5 families segregating X-linked high myopia with cone
dysfunction (300843), and found that affected individuals from 4 of the
families had either a greater (4 or 5) or fewer (1) number of copies of
CXORF2 than the 3 copies found in unaffected individuals. Metlapally et
al. (2009) suggested that CXORF2 gene CNVs appear to be associated with
the X-linked myopia and cone dysfunction phenotype.

604163	TITLE *604163 RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN L3; RPL3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

RPL3 is an essential and indispensable component for formation of the
ribosomal peptidyltransferase center. It has a role in aminoacyl-tRNA
binding, peptidyltransferase activity, drug resistance, translational
frame maintenance, and virus replication. RPL3 also acts as a binding
site for a ribosome inhibitory protein (Meskauskas and Dinman, 2007).

CLONING

Adams et al. (1992) isolated the 3-prime region of an RPL3 cDNA as a
human brain EST. The complete coding sequence of the human RPL3 gene has
been deposited in GenBank (GENBANK X73460). The deduced RPL3 protein has
403 amino acids.

Cuccurese et al. (2005) identified an RPL3 splice variant in a human
lung carcinoma cell line that was induced by pharmacologic blockade of
the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway. This splice variant retains
the 3-prime-most 180 nucleotides of intron 3, resulting in an in-frame
premature termination codon. Northern blot analysis showed that the
variant transcript is 1.5 kb, while the major RPL3 transcript is 1.3 kb.
Intron 3 is highly conserved in human, mouse, and bovine RPL3.

GENE FUNCTION

Cuccurese et al. (2005) blocked nonsense-mediated mRNA decay using
cycloheximide and wortmannin and observed pronounced accumulation of the
1.5-kb RPL3 splice variant, but no change in the level of the major RPL3
transcript. The level of the 1.5-kb transcript progressively decreased
following drug withdrawal. RPL3 protein overexpression resulted in
accumulation of the alternative transcript in a dose-dependent manner.
Cuccurese et al. (2005) concluded that the RPL3 protein regulates
alternative splicing of the RPL3 gene.

Meskauskas and Dinman (2007) stated that RPL3 has 2 long tentacle-like
structures that extend deep into the mostly rRNA core of the ribosome.
The central extension, called the 'W finger,' reaches all the way to the
A-site side of the peptidyltransferase center. Meskauskas and Dinman
(2007) used targeted mutagenesis and structural, biochemical, and
genetic approaches to examine the W finger of S. cerevisiae Rpl3. The
findings suggested a model in which RPL3 plays a role in synchronizing
aminoacyl-tRNA accommodation and translocation by functioning as a
sensor of tRNA occupancy at the A site of the peptidyltransferase
center.

GENE STRUCTURE

Duga et al. (2000) determined that the RPL3 gene contains 10 exons and
spans about 6.7 kb. Introns 1, 3, 5, and 7 of the RPL3 gene encode the
C/D box small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) U43 (SNORD43; 611068), U86
(611069), U83A (SNORD83A; 611070), and U83B (SNORD83B; 611071),
respectively. Intron 4 harbors a 283-bp Alu-SP-like repeat.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid mapping analyses, Kenmochi
et al. (1998) mapped the human RPL3 gene to 22q.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Duga et al. (2000) identified a polymorphic 19-bp deletion within intron
6 of the RPL3 gene that showed an allelic frequency of about 3% in a
Northern Italian population.

;;TUBULIN, BETA-2C; TUBB2C;;
TUBULIN, BETA-2;;
TUBULIN, BETA, CLASS IVB
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Microtubules are dynamic polymeric structures consisting of heterodimers
of alpha-tubulins (see 602529) and beta-tubulins, such as TUBB4B, that
are continuously incorporated and released. Microtubules function in
mitosis, intracellular transport, neuron morphology, and ciliary and
flagellar motility (Leandro-Garcia et al., 2010).

CLONING

Lewis et al. (1985) cloned the tubulin beta-2 isoform gene. The beta-2
gene is expressed as a 1.8-kb mRNA, and the sequence encodes a predicted
445-amino acid protein. Lewis and Cowan (1990) stated that the mouse
homolog of beta-2, M-beta-3, is expressed abundantly in testis and at
lower levels in many other tissues.

Using database analysis, Leandro-Garcia et al. (2010) identified 8 major
beta-tubulins, including TUBB4B, which they called TUBB2C. Quantitative
RT-PCR showed variable TUBB2C expression in all 21 normal human tissues
examined, with highest expression in heart and testis, and lowest
expression in prostate. TUBB2C was the predominant beta-tubulin isotype
in testis, kidney, heart, skeletal muscle, and lung. Abnormal TUBB2C
expression was detected in several tumors compared with their normal
counterparts.

GENE FAMILY

Lewis and Cowan (1990) reviewed the beta-tubulin gene family. In humans,
this family consists of 15 to 20 dispersed genes, many of which are
processed pseudogenes. The positions of the first 2 introns are
identical among members of the human and chicken gene families. Within a
vertebrate species, the genes are distinguished by their C-terminal
region. The amino acid sequence differences show varying degrees of
conservation across species, depending on the isotype.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the TUBB4B gene to chromosome 9q34.3 based on an
alignment of the TUBB4B sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC001911) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

610431	TITLE *610431 RING FINGER PROTEIN 167; RNF167
;;RING105
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

RNF167 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that interacts with TSSC5 (SLC22A18;
602631) and, together with UBCH6 (UBE2E1; 602916), facilitates TSSC5
polyubiquitylation (Yamada and Gorbsky, 2006).

CLONING

Using bacterial 2-hybrid screening with CDC34 (116948) as bait, Yamada
and Gorbsky (2006) isolated RNF167, which they called RING105. The
predicted 350-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal transmembrane
(TM) domain, followed by a protease-associated domain, a second TM
domain, a RING finger domain, and a putative PEST sequence. Fluorescence
microscopy and immunoblot analyses demonstrated that the 45-kD RING105
protein was expressed on cytoplasmic membranes and was most abundant in
liver and kidney.

GENE FUNCTION

Yamada and Gorbsky (2006) found that ectopic expression of RING105 in
HeLa and embryonic kidney cells resulted in protein degradation in the
absence of a proteasome inhibitor. Immunoprecipitation analysis with
UBCH5A (UBE2D1; 602961) and UBCH6 showed that RING105 had
autoubiquitylation activity. Bacterial 2-hybrid screening with RING105
as bait revealed an interaction with TSSC5, which, like RING105,
localized to cytoplasmic membranes. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot
analyses with truncated forms of TSSC5 demonstrated that TSSC5 was
polyubiquitylated on its sixth hydrophilic loop in an accelerated manner
in the presence of RING105 and UBCH6. FACS analysis showed that RING105
delayed cell-cycle transition in a RING finger domain-dependent manner.
Yamada and Gorbsky (2006) proposed that UBCH6 and RING105 may define a
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway that targets TSSC5.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the RNF167
gene to chromosome 17 (TMAP RH12586).

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In a bioinformatics analysis to reveal proteins related to Abraxas
(ABRA1; 611143), Wang et al. (2007) identified the KIAA0157 protein
(Nagase et al., 1995). The 415-amino acid protein, which Wang et al.
(2007) designated ABRO1 for 'Abraxas brother-1,' shares 39% identity to
ABRA1 in the N-terminal two-thirds of the protein (amino acids 1 to
260), including a coiled-coil domain and a region called the ABR domain.
However, ABRO1 lacks the phosphorylated ser-X-X-phe motif of ABRA1 and,
unlike ABRA1, does not bind to BRCA1 (113705).

MAPPING

By PCR of a panel of human-rodent hybrid cell lines, Nagase et al.
(1995) mapped the FAM175B gene to chromosome 10.

605535	TITLE *605535 HIGH MOBILITY GROUP PROTEIN 20B; HMG20B
;;BRCA2-ASSOCIATED FACTOR, 35-KD; BRAF35
DESCRIPTION High mobility group (HMG) proteins are nonhistone chromosomal proteins
that contain a conserved DNA-binding domain called the HMG box. See HMG2
(163906) for additional information on HMG proteins.

By EST database searching for sequences homologous to HMG20A (605534),
Sumoy et al. (2000) identified a novel member of the HMG family, which
they designated HMG20B. The longest cDNA obtained encodes a deduced
317-amino acid protein. Northern blot analysis detected 2 major
transcripts of approximately 2.6 and 1.5 kb. The highest expression of
the 1.5-kb form was found in prostate, testis, heart, and kidney, while
brain, spleen, lung, skeletal muscle, and leukocytes showed lower
levels. Within the brain, it was expressed almost uniformly, with
increased levels in the corpus callosum and hippocampus. The 2.6-kb
transcript was expressed at lower levels and was found in thymus,
prostate, placenta, liver, kidney, and pancreas.

Germline mutations of the BRCA2 gene (600185) confer susceptibility to
breast cancer. Marmorstein et al. (2001) isolated a 2-MD
BRCA2-containing complex from HeLa cells and, using mass spectrometry,
identified a structural DNA-binding component they designated BRAF35.
The 317-amino acid BRAF35 protein contains a nonspecific DNA-binding HMG
domain and a kinesin-like coiled-coil domain. The only protein with
structural domains similar to those of BRAF35 was BAF57 (603111), a
subunit of the SWI/SNF complex. In situ hybridization showed that
similar to BRCA2, BRAF35 mRNA expression levels in mouse embryos were
highest in proliferating tissues with high mitotic index. Strikingly,
nuclear staining revealed a close association of the BRAF35-BRCA2
complex with condensed chromatin coincident with histone H3 (see 602810)
phosphorylation. Antibody microinjection experiments suggested a role
for the BRCA2-BRAF35 complex in modulation of cell cycle progression.

Sumoy et al. (2000) inferred the map position of HMG20B from genomic
clone sequence annotation to be in 19p13.3, between D19S209 and D19S216
(Deloukas et al., 1998).

611617	TITLE *611617 EF-HAND DOMAIN FAMILY, MEMBER D1; EFHD1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

EFHD1 is an EF-hand domain-containing protein that displays increased
expression during neuronal differentiation (Tominaga and Tomooka, 2002).

CLONING

By subtractive hybridization analysis to identify genes upregulated in
differentiated mouse cerebellar cells compared to undifferentiated
cells, followed by database analysis, Tominaga and Tomooka (2002) cloned
mouse Efhd1. The deduced 240-amino acid mouse protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 27 kD. Efhd1 contains 2 putative EF-hand motifs, a
putative coiled-coil region, and 7 potential phosphorylation sites.
Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues detected high expression in
testis, followed by ovary, kidney, cerebrum, cerebellum, heart, liver,
and spleen. Northern blot analysis of developing cerebrum and cerebellum
showed progressively upregulated expression of Efhd1 during postnatal
development. Southern blot analysis characterized Efhd1 as a single-copy
gene. In situ hybridization of adult mouse brain detected expression
primarily in neurons of the cerebellum, cerebrum, and hippocampus, with
little expression in white matter. In postnatal mouse brain, Efhd1
expression was detected in the Purkinje cell layer of P0 sagittal
cortex, while at later stages Efhd1 expression was observed in the
Purkinje cell layer and internal granule cell layer, with increased
signal in later developmental stages. Efhd1 expression was also
localized specifically to spermatocytes, ovarian granulosa cells, and to
collecting ducts of adult kidney. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that mouse
Efhd1 bound Ca(2+) in vitro.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the EFHD1
gene to chromosome 2 (TMAP G31075).

179095	TITLE *179095 UBIQUITIN-CONJUGATING ENZYME E2B; UBE2B
;;RAD6, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF, TYPE B; RAD6B;;
HHR6B
DESCRIPTION See RAD6A (312180).

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization using a biotinylated probe, Koken et al. (1992)
assigned the UBE2B gene, the human homolog of yeast rad6, to 5q23-q31.
Studies in interspecific backcrosses by Roller et al. (1995) showed 2
genes related to UBE2B in the mouse: one mapped to mouse chromosome 13,
which shows homology to human 5q and may represent the functional gene.
A second maps to a region of chromosome 11 with homology to human
chromosome 17 and may represent a pseudogene.

GENETIC VARIABILITY

Lench et al. (1995) used PCR to detect polymorphisms in a (CGG)n
trinucleotide repeat sequence in the 5-prime region of the UBE2B DNA
repair gene, which they referred to as HHR6B.

GENE FUNCTION

The RAD6 pathway is central to postreplicative DNA repair in eukaryotic
cells. Two principal elements of this pathway are the
ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes RAD6 and the MMS2 (603001)-UBC13 (603679)
heterodimer, which are recruited to chromatin by the RING-finger
proteins RAD18 (605256) and RAD5 (608048), respectively. Hoege et al.
(2002) showed that UBC9 (601661), a small ubiquitin-related modifier
(SUMO)-conjugating enzyme, is also affiliated with this pathway and that
proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA; 176740), a DNA polymerase
sliding clamp involved in DNA synthesis and repair, is a substrate. PCNA
is monoubiquitinated through RAD6 and RAD18, modified by lys63-linked
multiubiquitination, which additionally requires MMS2, UBC13, and RAD5,
and is conjugated to SUMO by UBC9. All 3 modifications affect the same
lysine residue of PCNA, K164, suggesting that they label PCNA for
alternative functions. Hoege et al. (2002) demonstrated that these
modifications differentially affect resistance to DNA damage, and that
damage-induced PCNA ubiquitination is elementary for DNA repair and
occurs at the same conserved residue in yeast and humans.

Ulrich and Jentsch (2000) demonstrated that RAD18 and RAD5 play a
central role in mediating physical contacts between the members of the
RAD6 pathway. RAD5 recruits the UBC13-MMS2 complex to DNA by means of
its RING finger domain. Moreover, RAD5 association with RAD18 brings
UBC13-MMS2 into contact with the RAD6-RAD18 complex. Interaction between
the 2 RING finger proteins thus promotes the formation of a heteromeric
complex in which the 2 distinct ubiquitin-conjugating activities of RAD6
and UBC13-MMS2 can be closely coordinated. Ulrich and Jentsch (2000)
found that while UBC13 and MMS2 are largely cytosolic proteins, DNA
damage triggers their redistribution to the nucleus.

Hishida et al. (2009) examined the response of yeast cells to chronic
low dose ultraviolet light (CLUV) and identified a key role for the
RAD6-RAD18 (605256)-RAD5 (608048) error-free postreplication repair
(PRR) pathway in promoting cell growth and survival. They found that
loss of the RAD6 error-free PRR pathway resulted in DNA damage
checkpoint-induced G2 arrest in CLUV-exposed cells, whereas wildtype and
nucleotide excision repair-deficient cells were largely unaffected. Cell
cycle arrest in the absence of the RAD6 error-free PRR pathway was not
caused by a repair defect or by the accumulation of ultraviolet-induced
photoproducts. Hishida et al. (2009) observed increased replication
protein A (RPA; see 179835)- and Rad52 (600392)-yellow fluorescent
protein foci in the CLUV-exposed Rad18 (605256)-delta cells and
demonstrated that Rad52-mediated homologous recombination is required
for the viability of the Rad18-delta cells after release from
CLUV-induced G2 arrest. These and other data presented suggested that,
in response to environmental levels of ultraviolet exposure, the RAD6
error-free PRR pathway promotes replication of damaged templates without
the generation of extensive single-stranded DNA regions. Thus this
pathway is specifically important during chronic low-dose ultraviolet
exposure to prevent counterproductive DNA checkpoint activation and
allow cells to proliferate normally.

ANIMAL MODEL

Roest et al. (1996) reported the phenotype of the first animal mutant in
the ubiquitin pathway. Experimental inactivation of the RAD6B gene in
mice caused male infertility. Derailment of spermatogenesis became overt
during the postmeiotic condensation of chromatin in spermatids. In yeast
the gene is not only implicated in postreplication repair and
damage-induced mutagenesis but is also required for sporulation and may
modulate chromatin structure via histone ubiquitination. The authors
stated that the findings in the 'knock-out' mice provided a parallel
between yeast sporulation and mammalian spermatogenesis and strongly
implicated RAD6-dependent ubiquitination in chromatin remodeling in the
human. Since heterozygous male mice and even knockout female mice are
completely normal and fertile and thus able to transmit the defect,
similar RAD6B mutations may cause male infertility in man. The fact that
the RAD6B mice are viable and phenotypically normal is presumably due to
functional redundancy with RAD6A (312180).

Baarends et al. (2003) determined that primary spermatocytes of Hr6b
knockout mice underwent increased apoptosis during meiotic prophase. In
the absence of Hr6b, the structure and telomere localization of
synaptonemal complexes were altered within the nuclei of pachytene and
diplotene spermatocytes. The number of foci containing the mismatch DNA
repair protein Mlh1 (120436) was increased and reflected a consistent 20
to 25% increase in crossing-over frequency in mutant spermatocytes.
Baarends et al. (2003) concluded that the ubiquitin-conjugating activity
of HR6B is required within the synaptonemal complex and for meiotic
recombination in spermatocytes.

NOMENCLATURE

Roest et al. (1996) referred to the 2 closely related human homologs of
yeast RAD6 as hHR6A and hHR6B (for human homologs of RAD6).

602775	TITLE *602775 SUPPRESSOR OF CLEAR, C. ELEGANS, HOMOLOG OF; SHOC2
;;RAS-BINDING PROTEIN SUR8, C. ELEGANS, HOMOLOG OF; SUR8
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Activation of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors elicits diverse
cellular responses, including growth, mitogenesis, migration, and
differentiation. Selfors et al. (1998) shed light on the intracellular
signaling pathways that mediate these processes by studies in
Caenorhabditis elegans. In this organism, they screened for genes that
suppress the activity of an activated form of the EGL-15 FGF receptor
consistent with the functioning of these genes downstream of EGL-15. Two
of these genes were soc1 and soc2, symbolized thus for 'suppressor of
clear (Clr)' phenotype; the third was sem5. Selfors et al. (1998) showed
that soc2 encodes a protein composed almost entirely of leucine-rich
repeats, a domain implicated in protein-protein interactions. They
identified a putative human homolog, SHOC2, which is 54% identical to
soc2. They showed that SHOC2 mRNA was expressed in all tissues assayed
and that the SHOC2 protein is localized to the cytoplasm.

Selfors et al. (1998) showed that within the leucine-rich repeats of
both soc2 and SHOC2 are 2 YXNX motifs that are potential
tyrosine-phosphorylated docking sites for the SEM5/GRB2 Src homology 2
domain. However, phosphorylation of these residues was not required for
soc2 function in vivo, and SHOC2 was not observed to be tyrosine
phosphorylated in response to FGF stimulation. Selfors et al. (1998)
concluded that this genetic system identified a conserved gene
implicated in mediating FGF receptor signaling in C. elegans.

MAPPING

By FISH analysis, Selfors et al. (1998) mapped the SHOC2 gene to
chromosome 10q25.

GENE FUNCTION

Sieburth et al. (1998) identified and characterized the sur8 gene in C.
elegans, which positively regulates Ras-mediated signal transduction
during vulval development. The authors found that reduction of sur8
function suppresses an activated Ras mutation and dramatically enhances
phenotypes of mpk1/sur1 MAP kinase (see 176948) and ksr1 (601132)
mutations, whereas increase of sur8 dosage enhances an activated Ras
mutation. Sur8 appears to act downstream of or in parallel to Ras but
upstream of Raf. Sur8 encodes a conserved protein that is composed
predominantly of leucine-rich repeats. The sur8 protein interacts
directly with Ras but not with the Ras(P34G) mutant protein, suggesting
that sur8 may mediate its effects through Ras binding. By use of EST
primers and 5-prime RACE, Sieburth et al. (1998) cloned a structural and
functional SUR8 homolog in humans that specifically binds K-Ras (190070)
and N-Ras (164790) but not H-Ras (190020) in vitro.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using a systems biology approach based on in silico protein network
analysis that identified SHOC2 as a candidate gene, Cordeddu et al.
(2009) sequenced SHOC2 coding exons in a Noonan syndrome (see 163950)
cohort that included 96 individuals who were negative for mutations in
known disease genes. The authors identified a heterozygous mutation
(S2G; 602775.0001) in the SHOC2 gene in 4 unrelated individuals. They
then analyzed the SHOC2 gene in a cohort of 410 mutation-negative
patients with Noonan syndrome or a related phenotype and identified 21
individuals with the same S2G mutation. All of the patients with the S2G
mutation had a relatively consistent Noonan syndrome-like disorder with
loose anagen hair (NSLH; 607721). Functional studies of S2G-mutant SHOC2
demonstrated introduction of an N-myristoylation site, resulting in
aberrant localization and signaling.

In a male infant with typical dysmorphic facial features and other signs
of Noonan syndrome, who died of congestive heart failure at 4 months of
age, Hoban et al. (2012) identified heterozygosity for the S2G mutation
in SHOC2.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
NOONAN SYNDROME-LIKE DISORDER WITH LOOSE ANAGEN HAIR
SHOC2, SER2GLY

In 21 patients with a Noonan syndrome-like disorder with loose anagen
hair (NSLH; 607721), Cordeddu et al. (2009) identified heterozygosity
for a 4A-G transition in exon 2 of the SHOC2 gene, resulting in a
ser2-to-gly (S2G) substitution. The mutation was shown to be de novo in
the 15 patients for whom parental DNA was available. Functional studies
demonstrated that the S2G mutation introduces an N-myristoylation site,
resulting in aberrant targeting of SHOC2 to the plasma membrane and
impaired translocation to the nucleus upon growth factor stimulation. In
vitro expression of mutant SHOC2 enhanced MAPK (176948) activation in a
cell type-specific fashion. Induction of mutant SHOC2 in C. elegans
engendered protruding vulva, a neomorphic phenotype previously
associated with aberrant signaling.

In a male infant with typical dysmorphic facial features and other signs
of Noonan syndrome, who died of congestive heart failure at 4 months of
age, Hoban et al. (2012) identified heterozygosity for the S2G mutation
in SHOC2. The authors noted that the 'loose anagen hair' phenotype and
skin features previously reported in patients with the S2G mutation were
not present in this young infant, and stated that the cardiac anomaly
expanded the clinical phenotype associated with the SHOC2 mutation.

611734	TITLE *611734 WD REPEAT-CONTAINING PROTEIN 77; WDR77
;;METHYLOSOME PROTEIN, 50-KD; MEP50;;
ANDROGEN RECEPTOR-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN, 44-KD; p44
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

WDR77 is a component of the 20S PRMT5 (604045)-containing
methyltransferase complex, which modifies specific arginines to
dimethylarginines in several spliceosomal Sm proteins (see 601061). This
modification targets Sm proteins to the survival of motor neurons (SMN)
complex (see 600354) for assembly into small nuclear ribonucleoprotein
core particles (Friesen et al., 2002).

CLONING

By peptide sequencing of a protein associated with the 20S
methyltransferase complex, followed by database analysis, Friesen et al.
(2002) obtained a full-length clone encoding WDR77, which they called
MEP50. The deduced 342-amino acid protein has 6 WD repeats and has a
calculated molecular mass of 36.7 kD. By SDS-PAGE, MEP50 had an apparent
molecular mass of 50 kD.

Using biochemical cellular fractionation and immunofluorescence
analysis, Licciardo et al. (2003) showed that MEP50 localized to both
the nucleus and cytoplasm in human cells.

Liang et al. (2007) showed that PRMT5 and WDR77, which they called p44,
were expressed predominantly as nuclear proteins in fetal Leydig cells
and adult human testis, whereas they were predominantly cytoplasmic in
fetal germ cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Friesen et al. (2002) showed that endogenous MEP50 associated with PRMT5
in the 20S arginine methyltransferase complex in HeLa cells. Protein
pull-down assays revealed that MEP50 specifically interacted with SmB
(SNRPB; 182282) and SmD2 (SNRPD2; 601061) and more weakly with SmD3
(SNRPD3; 601062) and SmE (SNRPE; 128260). Antibodies directed against
MEP50 significantly reduced the arginine methyltransferase activity of
the immunopurified complex toward Sm substrates.

FCP1 (CTDP1; 604927) is a phosphatase specific for the C-terminal domain
(CTD) of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II (POLR2A; 180660), which
is cyclically phosphorylated during RNA polymerase II transcription.
Licciardo et al. (2003) found that FCP1-affinity purified complexes in
an FCP1-expressing human lung carcinoma cell line (H1299) contained
MEP50 and RNA polymerase II. Glycerol gradient fractionation and Western
blot analysis of H1299 whole cell extracts detected MEP50 in protein
complexes of 400 kD and more than 800 kD. In nuclear extracts, MEP50 was
associated only with the 400-kD complex, which also appeared to contain
FCP1 and was distinct from the larger methyltransferase complex
containing PRMT5.

SUZ12 (606245) belongs to the polycomb group of proteins, which mediate
chromatin modification and epigenetic repression of gene expression.
Using yeast 2-hybrid, coimmunoprecipitation, and protein pull-down
analyses, Furuno et al. (2006) found that SUZ12 interacted with mouse
and human MEP50. Human MEP50 interacted with free histone H2a (see
601772) from calf thymus, but not with other histones or with H2A
complexed in isolated HeLa cell nucleosomes. PRMT5-mediated
transcriptional repression of a reporter gene was dependent on MEP50.
Furuno et al. (2006) concluded that MEP50 may be an adaptor between
PRMT5 and its H2A substrate and that SUZ12 may have a role in
transcriptional regulation through physical interaction with MEP50.

Using in vitro assays and in vivo tumor xenograft experiments, Peng et
al. (2008) showed that nuclear human p44 inhibits prostate cancer (see
176807) growth, at least in part, through the regulation of cell cycle
regulatory genes that include p21 (CDKN1A; 116899). Conversely,
cytoplasmic p44 promoted prostate cancer growth through upregulation of
cyclin D2 (123833) and CDK6 (603368). Immunofluorescence analysis of
prostate cancer tissue indicated that nuclear exclusion of p44 was
associated with androgen-independent prostate cancer.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the WDR77
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP RH11857).

ANIMAL MODEL

Liang et al. (2007) showed that heterozygous Wdr77 knockout mice had
increased testicular size and increased numbers of spermatocytes,
spermatozoa, and spermatids compared with testis from wildtype mice.

602074	TITLE *602074 DEATH-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 3; DAP3
;;MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN S29; MRPS29
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Kissil et al. (1995) cloned DAP3. DAP3 is transcribed into a 1.7-kb mRNA
and encodes a 46-kD protein carrying a potential nucleotide-binding
motif.

By proteolytic digestion of whole bovine 28S subunits, followed by
peptide analysis and EST database analysis, Koc et al. (2001) identified
full-length human DAP3, which they called MRPS29. The deduced 397-amino
acid MRPS29 protein has a calculated molecular mass of 45.6 kD. Removal
of a predicted 16-amino acid N-terminal mitochondrial localization
signal results in a mature 43.6-kD protein. Koc et al. (2001) identified
MRPS29 orthologs in mouse, Drosophila, C. elegans, and yeast, but not in
E. coli. Mouse and human MRPS29 share 81.8% amino acid identity.

GENE FUNCTION

Kissil et al. (1995) found that DAP3 was involved in mediating
interferon-gamma (147570)-induced cell death. Several lines of evidence
suggested that suppression of cell death is a critical step in the
multistage process of tumorigenesis. Kissil et al. (1995) concluded that
DAP3, being a positive mediator of cell death, may be a tumor suppressor
gene subject to loss or inactivation in tumors.

MAPPING

Kissil and Kimchi (1997) mapped the DAP3 gene to chromosome 1q21 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. Verification of the assignment was
achieved by identifying the gene in a YAC contig encompassing chromosome
1q21.1-q21.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Hirota et al. (2004) found a strong association between bronchial asthma
(600807) in adults and SNPs in the DAP3 gene (p = 0.0051; OR = 1.87; 95%
CI = 1.20-2.92), but no association with childhood asthma. The tendency
was more prominent in patients with high serum total immunoglobulin E
(IgE; 147180). DAP3 was found to be expressed in normal bronchial
epithelial cells, and that expression was induced by IFNG.

612688	TITLE *612688 RING FINGER PROTEIN 168; RNF168
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The complex repair response elicited by DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs)
includes recruitment of several DNA repair proteins and ubiquitination
of H2A-type histones (see 613499). RNF168 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase
critical for DSB repair (Stewart et al., 2009).

CLONING

Using RNA interference to identify proteins required for accumulation of
53BP1 (TP53BP1; 605230) at sites of DNA damage, Doil et al. (2009) and
Stewart et al. (2009) independently identified RNF168. The deduced
571-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal RING finger domain,
followed by 2 'motifs interacting with ubiquitin' (MIU) domains. Doil et
al. (2009) noted that the first MIU domain is located within a
coiled-coil region.

GENE FUNCTION

Independently, Doil et al. (2009) and Stewart et al. (2009) found that
RNF168 was required to sustain conjugated ubiquitin (191339) at DSBs.
RNF168 assembled at DSBs in an RNF8 (611685)-dependent manner and
functioned as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that acted with UBC13 (UBE2N;
603679) to catalyze formation of lys63-linked ubiquitin conjugates and
promote ubiquitination of H2A and H2AX (H2AFX; 601772). Ubiquitinated
H2A and H2AX in turn mediated accumulation of 53BP1 and BRCA1 (113705)
at DSBs to promote DSB repair and DNA damage checkpoints.

Nakada et al. (2010) reported that OTUB1 (608337), a deubiquitinating
enzyme, is an inhibitor of double-stranded break-induced chromatin
ubiquitination. Surprisingly, they found that OTUB1 suppresses
RNF168-dependent polyubiquitination independently of its catalytic
activity. OTUB1 does so by binding to and inhibiting UBC13, the cognate
E2 enzyme for RNF168. Nakada et al. (2010) suggested that this unusual
mode of regulation is unlikely to be limited to UBC13 because analysis
of OTUB1-associated proteins revealed that OTUB1 binds to E2s of the
UBE2D and UBE2E subfamilies. Finally, OTUB1 depletion mitigates the
double-stranded break repair defect associated with defective ATM
(607585) signaling, indicating that pharmacologic targeting of the
OTUB1-UBC13 interaction might enhance the DNA damage response.

Okamoto et al. (2013) addressed the molecular properties of TRF2
(602027) that are both necessary and sufficient to protect chromosome
ends in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and stated that their data
supported a 2-step mechanism for TRF2-mediated end protection. First,
the dimerization domain of TRF2 is required to inhibit ATM (607585)
activation, the key initial step involved in the activation of a DNA
damage response (DDR). Next, TRF2 independently suppresses the
propagation of DNA damage signaling downstream of ATM activation. This
novel modulation of the DDR at telomeres occurs at the level of the E3
ubiquitin ligase RNF168. Inhibition of RNF168 at telomeres involves the
deubiquitinating enzyme BRCC3 (300617) and the ubiquitin ligase UBR5
(608413), and is sufficient to suppress chromosome end-to-end fusions.
Okamoto et al. (2013) concluded that this 2-step mechanism for
TRF2-mediated end protection helped to explain the apparent paradox of
frequent localization of DDR proteins at functional telomeres without
concurrent induction of detrimental DNA repair activities.

GENE STRUCTURE

Stewart et al. (2009) determined that the RNF168 gene contains at least
6 exons.

MAPPING

Doil et al. (2009) stated that the RNF168 gene maps to chromosome 3q29.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a patient with RIDDLE syndrome (611943), Stewart et al. (2009)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 truncating mutations in the
RNF168 gene (612688.0001 and 612688.0002). The authors noted that the
patient's father, who was heterozygous for 1 of the mutations, had
developed chronic B-cell leukemia, suggesting that RNF168 may also act
as a tumor suppressor gene.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RIDDLE SYNDROME
RNF168, 1-BP DUP, 397G

In a patient with RIDDLE syndrome (611943), Stewart et al. (2009)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the RNF168 gene: a
1-bp duplication (397dupG) and a 4-bp deletion (1323delACAA;
612688.0002). Both mutations resulted in a frameshift and premature
protein truncation. Each unaffected parent was heterozygous for 1 of the
mutations. Immunostudies failed to detect any RNF168 protein in the
patient's cells, and expression of wildtype RNF168 restored
radioresistance. Stewart et al. (2009) concluded that lack of RNF168
resulted in the inability to repair double-stranded DNA breaks.

612604	TITLE *612604 LATE CORNIFIED ENVELOPE PROTEIN 1B; LCE1B
;;LATE ENVELOPE PROTEIN 2; LEP2
DESCRIPTION For background information on the LCE gene cluster, see 612603.

CLONING

By database analysis to identify human orthologs of mouse genes encoding
late envelope proteins (LEPs), Marshall et al. (2001) identified LCE1B,
which they called LEP2. RT-PCR detected LEP2 in human skin, but not in
heart or esophagus.

Using real-time PCR, Jackson et al. (2005) detected low LCE1B expression
in human fetal, arm, penal, and abdominal skin. Little to no expression
was detected in vulva, tongue, and esophagus.

GENE STRUCTURE

Jackson et al. (2005) determined that LCE1B is a single-exon gene.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Marshall et al. (2001) mapped the LCE1B
gene within the LCE gene cluster on chromosome 1q21. Jackson et al.
(2005) stated that the mouse Lce1b gene maps to a syntenic LCE gene
cluster on chromosome 3F1.

172405	TITLE *172405 PHOSPHOLAMBAN; PLN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Phospholamban is expressed in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane as a
30-kD homopentamer. It controls cellular calcium levels by a mechanism
that depends on its phosphorylation (summary by Oxenoid and Chou, 2005).

CLONING

Using dog and rabbit phospholamban cDNAs as probes, Fujii et al. (1991)
cloned human phospholamban from a skeletal muscle cDNA library. The
deduced 52-amino acid human protein differs from rabbit, dog, and pig at
position 27 and from dog and pig at position 2. Northern blot analysis
of rabbit tissues detected phospholamban transcripts in heart and soleus
and in tissues rich in smooth muscle, such as uterus, small and large
intestine, trachea, bladder, esophagus, and aorta. No expression was
detected in plantaris, spleen, testis, brain, liver, and kidney.

McTiernan et al. (1999) found that human ventricle and quadriceps
displayed high levels of phospholamban transcripts and proteins, with
markedly lower expression in smooth muscles. The right atrium also
expressed low levels of phospholamban.

GENE STRUCTURE

Fujii et al. (1991) found that the rabbit Pln gene spans 13.2 kb and
contains only 1 intron, which separates exonic sequences in the 5-prime
UTR.

McTiernan et al. (1999) reported that the structure of the human
phospholamban gene closely resembles that reported for the chicken,
rabbit, rat, and mouse genes. Comparison of the human to other mammalian
phospholamban genes indicated a marked conservation of sequence for at
least 217 bp upstream of the transcription start site.

MAPPING

Using a human phospholamban cDNA, Fujii et al. (1991) mapped the
phospholamban gene to human chromosome 6. By fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Otsu et al. (1993) mapped the PLN gene to chromosome
6q22.1.

GENE FUNCTION

Fujii et al. (1991) stated that phospholamban is a major substrate for
the cAMP-dependent protein kinase in cardiac muscle. Phospholamban is an
inhibitor of cardiac muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase
(SERCA2a; see 108740) in the unphosphorylated state, but inhibition is
relieved upon phosphorylation of the protein. The subsequent activation
of the Ca(2+) pump leads to enhanced muscle relaxation rates, thereby
contributing to the inotropic response elicited in heart by beta
agonists. Phospholamban is also expressed in slow-twitch skeletal muscle
and some smooth muscle cells.

Asahi et al. (2004) generated mice with cardiac-specific overexpression
of epitope-tagged rabbit sarcolipin (SLN; 602203). Overexpression of Sln
decreased the apparent affinity of Serca2a (108740) for calcium in
transgenic hearts. The mice had altered calcium currents, impaired
cardiac contractility with altered tension and relaxation times, and
ventricular hypertrophy. Coimmunoprecipitation indicated that
overexpressed Sln bound both Serca2a and Pln, forming a ternary complex.
The results suggested that Sln overexpression inhibits Serca2a through
stabilization of Serca2a-Pln interaction and through inhibition of Pln
phosphorylation. Asahi et al. (2004) concluded that inhibition of
Serca2a impairs contractility and calcium cycling, but responsiveness to
beta-adrenergic agonists may prevent progression to heart failure.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Using NMR experiments, Oxenoid and Chou (2005) characterized the
reconstituted human PLN pentamer. They found that PLN assembled by
parallel packing into well-structured pentamers with 5-fold rotational
symmetry. In the PLN pentamer, the positively-charged N-terminal domains
formed alpha helices that repulsed one another via electrostatic charges
and assumed a bellflower appearance. The linker regions of each subunit
acquired dihedral angles characteristic of beta strands. The long,
largely hydrophobic C-terminal transmembrane alpha helices engaged in
leu/ile zipper interactions and formed a funnel-like pore with a
diameter of about 3.6 angstroms at its narrowest point. Oxenoid and Chou
(2005) concluded that, like monomeric PLN, pentameric PLN can interact
with the SERCA cytoplasmic domain due to the relative mobility of the
N-terminal SERCA-interacting domains. They proposed that the entire PLN
pentamer may have a dual function as a regulatory protein and as an ion
channel.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Dilated Cardiomyopathy 1P

Schmitt et al. (2003) sequenced the PLN gene in 20 unrelated individuals
with inherited dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure (see CMD1P,
609909). In 1 sample, an arginine-to-cysteine substitution at codon 9 in
the cytosolic PLN domain was identified and segregated with disease in
that 4-generation family (R9C;172405.0001). Affected individuals had
increased chamber dimensions and decreased contractile function at age
20 to 30 years, with progression to heart failure within 5 to 10 years
after symptom onset. Congestive heart failure was severe in 12
individuals, necessitating cardiac transplantation in 4. The average age
at death of affected individuals was 25.1 +/- 12.7 years.

In 2 unrelated families with CMD1P (609909), Haghighi et al. (2003)
identified a truncating mutation in the PLN gene, leu39 to ter (L39X;
172405.0002). The 2 homozygous individuals developed dilated
cardiomyopathy and heart failure requiring cardiac transplantation at
ages 16 and 27 years, respectively; 11 heterozygous individuals
exhibited variable clinical findings, indicating incomplete penetrance
of the cardiomyopathy phenotype. Haghighi et al. (2003) concluded that
in contrast to mice in which Pln deficiency enhances myocardial inotropy
and lusitropy without adverse effects, PLN is essential for cardiac
health in humans, and its absence results in lethal heart failure.

In affected members of a 7-generation family with CMD, Haghighi et al.
(2006) identified heterozygosity for a 3-bp deletion in the PLN gene
(172405.0003).

Haghighi et al. (2008) analyzed the PLN gene in 381 CMD patients and 296
controls with no known cardiomyopathy history and identified a
heterozygous -36A-C variant in the 5-prime untranslated region
(172405.0006) in 22 CMD patients and 1 control. Functional analysis
demonstrated that the -36A-C variant increased PLN activity by 24%
compared to wildtype and that this alteration in the steroid receptor
sequence for the glucocorticoid nuclear receptor/transcription factor
resulted in enhanced binding.

- Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy 18

Minamisawa et al. (2003) analyzed the candidate gene phospholamban (PLN)
in 87 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (see CMH18; 613874), 10
with dilated cardiomyopathy, and 2 patients with restricted
cardiomyopathy (RCM; see 115210). In the proband of a 2-generation
family with CMH, Minamisawa et al. (2003) identified heterozygosity for
a mutation in the promoter region (172405.0004) that increased
transcriptional activity 1.5-fold compared to wildtype and was not found
in 296 Japanese controls. No PLN mutations were identified in the
remaining 98 cardiomyopathy patients.

Kalemi et al. (2005) did not find mutations in the PLN gene in 53 Greek
patients with CMH, but noted that because 95% of identified CMH-related
mutations involve 4 genes, namely MYH7 (160760), TNNT2 (191045), MYBPC3
(600958), and TNNI3 (191044), a large cohort of CMH patients would be
required to identify a novel CMH-causing gene.

Medin et al. (2007) performed SSCP mutation screening and DNA sequencing
of the PLN gene in 101 CMH patients and 85 CMD patients and identified a
point mutation in the promoter region (172405.0005) in 1 CMH proband.

Chiu et al. (2007) screened an Australian cohort of 252 unrelated CMH
patients for mutations in calcium regulatory genes and identified
heterozygosity for the L39X mutation in the PLN gene in 1 proband
(172405.0002).

Landstrom et al. (2011) analyzed the PLN gene in a cohort of 1,064 CMH
probands and identified heterozygosity for the L39X mutation (L39X;
172405.0002) in a 58-year-old male proband with CMH.

Petkow-Dimitrow et al. (2011) screened 50 consecutive patients with CMH
from southern Poland for the R9C (172405.0001) and L39X mutations in the
PLN gene but did not find those mutations in any patients or in 50 sex-
and age-matched controls with normal echocardiograms.

ANIMAL MODEL

Luo et al. (1994) generated Pln -/- mice, which exhibited significantly
enhanced myocardial performance that was associated with an increase in
the affinity of Serca2 for Ca(2+). Isoproterenol dose-response curves
for contraction and relaxation in the Pln-null mice began at a maximum
level and were not further increased by isoproterenol. Luo et al. (1994)
concluded that PLN acts as a critical repressor of basal myocardial
contractility and may be the key phosphoprotein mediating in cardiac
contractile responses to beta-adrenergic agonists.

Using echocardiography to assess left ventricular function in Pln-null
mice in vivo, Hoit et al. (1995) observed significant increases in
multiple physiologic parameters compared to wildtype controls (p less
than 0.05) and concluded that PLN regulates basal left ventricular
function in vivo.

In a hamster model of progressive heart failure, Hoshijima et al. (2002)
used an in vivo transcoronary delivery system to administer recombinant
adeno-associated virus expressing a pseudophosphorylated mutant of human
PLN. The treatment suppressed progressive impairment of left ventricular
systolic function and contractility for 28 to 30 weeks; low left
ventricular systolic pressure and deterioration in left ventricular
relaxation were also largely prevented, protecting the hamsters from
myocardial cell loss.

Schmitt et al. (2003) generated transgenic mice expressing the PLN R9C
mutation under the control of the alpha-cardiac myosin heavy chain
(160710) promoter. Two independent lines with identical phenotype were
generated: biventricular cardiac dilation began at age 4 months, and
dilated cardiomyopathy was rapidly progressive. Cellular and biochemical
studies revealed that, unlike wildtype PLN, PLN-R9C did not directly
inhibit SERCA2a. Rather, PLN-R9C trapped protein kinase A (see 176911),
which blocked PKA-mediated phosphorylation of wildtype PLN and in turn
delayed decay of calcium transients in myocytes. Schmitt et al. (2003)
concluded that myocellular calcium dysregulation can initiate human
heart failure.

In transgenic mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of the PLN arg14
deletion, Haghighi et al. (2006) observed recapitulation of human
cardiomyopathy, with similar histopathologic abnormalities and premature
death. Coexpression of normal and mutant PLN in HEK293 cells resulted in
superinhibition of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase activity, and
the dominant effect of the arg14 deletion could not be fully removed,
even upon phosphorylation by protein kinase A (see 176911).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CARDIOMYOPATHY, DILATED, 1P
PLN, ARG9CYS

In a 4-generation family segregating autosomal dominant dilated
cardiomyopathy with heart failure (609909), Schmitt et al. (2003)
identified a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 25 of the PLN gene,
resulting in an arg9-to-cys (R9C) substitution in the cytosolic PLN
domain. This mutation segregated absolutely with affected status in the
family, occurred in a highly conserved residue, and was absent from more
than 200 normal chromosomes. In the family, affected individuals had
increased chamber dimensions and decreased contractile function at age
20 to 30 years, with progression to heart failure within 5 to 10 years
after symptom onset. Congestive heart failure was severe in 12
individuals, necessitating cardiac transplantation in 4. The average age
at death in affected individuals was 25.1 +/- 12.7 years.

Using biochemical and biophysical techniques in vitro and in live cells,
Ha et al. (2011) found that the R9C mutation led to stabilization of
pentameric PLN due to disulfide bridge formation between the cytoplasmic
domains of individual PLN(R9C) subunits. Stabilization of the PLN
pentamer inhibited the dissociation of the pentamer into PLN monomers
and promoted the formation of PLN(R9C) dimers, particularly under
oxidative conditions. PKA (see 176911)-mediated phosphorylation of
pentameric PLN(R9C) was significantly impaired due to this
stabilization.

PLN, LEU39TER

In 2 unrelated families with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (609909),
Haghighi et al. (2003) identified a 116T-G transversion in the PLN gene,
resulting in a leu39-to-ter (L39X) substitution that truncated the
52-amino acid protein in the highly conserved transmembrane domain II.
The 2 homozygous individuals developed dilated cardiomyopathy and heart
failure requiring cardiac transplantation at ages 16 and 27 years,
respectively; 11 heterozygous individuals exhibited variable clinical
findings indicating incomplete penetrance of the cardiomyopathy
phenotype: 2 had dilated cardiomyopathy with ejection fractions of 25%
or less, 4 had left ventricular hypertrophy with normal left ventricular
systolic function, and 5 had normal echocardiograms.

In a 65-year-old Australian woman who was diagnosed with familial
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (CMH18; 613874) at age 61 years, Chiu et al.
(2007) identified heterozygosity for the L39X mutation in the PLN gene.
Echocardiography revealed asymmetric septal hypertrophy with a maximum
wall thickness of 20 mm, normal systolic contractile function, and no
evidence of left ventricular dilation. Her mother had also been
diagnosed with CMH and had died at age 80 of noncardiac causes.

In a 58-year-old man with CMH18, Landstrom et al. (2011) identified
heterozygosity for the L39X mutation in the PLN gene. The mutation
segregated with disease in the family and was not found in 300 controls.

deletion of a highly conserved arg14 residue. By middle age,
heterozygous individuals in this family developed left ventricular

with overt heart failure in some cases. No homozygous individuals were

heterozygosity for a -77A-G transition in the promoter region of the PLN
gene. Functional analysis in transiently transfected neonatal rat
cardiomyocytes demonstrated that the mutation resulted in a 1.5-fold
increase in PLN transcription compared to wildtype. The mutation was not
found in 296 Japanese controls. The proband's family history was
consistent with a late-onset type of CMH: her father, who was diagnosed
with cardiomyopathy, had died at age 82, and an older brother was also
diagnosed with CMH at age 62 years. None of the family members were
available for study.

PLN, -42C-G

In an 85-year-old woman who was diagnosed with apical hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (CMH18; 613874) at 67 years of age, Medin et al. (2007)
identified heterozygosity for a -42C-G transversion n the promoter
region of the PLN gene that was not found in more than 100 control
subjects. Mutations in 6 other known CMH genes were excluded in the
proband. Transfection studies in the C6 glioma cell line and C2C12
muscle cells demonstrated a 43% and 47% decrease in transcriptional
activity compared to wildtype, respectively. The proband's brother was
diagnosed with apical CMH at 72 years of age and died suddenly at age 81
years. Screening of the proband's 3 asymptomatic sons revealed that 1
had apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with mild hypertrophy at age 59
years; the other 2 had normal electro- and echocardiograms. The affected
son and a 55-year-old asymptomatic son were also heterozygous for the
-42C-G mutation.

CARDIOMYOPATHY, DILATED, 1P
PLN, -36A-C

Haghighi et al. (2008) analyzed the PLN gene in 381 CMD patients and 296
controls with no known cardiomyopathy history and identified a
heterozygous -36A-C transversion in the PLN promoter region in 22 CMD
patients and 1 control. Luciferase reporter analysis in rat neonatal
cardiomyocytes demonstrated that the -36A-C variant increased PLN
activity by 24% compared to wildtype. In addition, the -36A-C alteration
in the steroid receptor sequence for the glucocorticoid nuclear
receptor/transcription factor resulted in enhanced binding. Haghighi et
al. (2008) suggested that this variant might contribute to depressed
contractility and accelerate functional deterioration in heart failure.

612971	TITLE *612971 PDZ DOMAIN-CONTAINING 7; PDZD7
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Schneider et al. (2009) used positional cloning to identify the PDZD7
gene from junction fragments of a reciprocal t(10;11) translocation.
They identified 4 PDZD7 isoforms; isoforms A and B contain 2 PDZ
domains, and the shorter isoforms C and D contain no PDZ domains and 1
PDZ domain, respectively. RT-PCR analysis detected PDZD7 expression in
human cortex with weak expression in the human inner ear.

GENE STRUCTURE

Schneider et al. (2009) reported that PDZD7 consists of 16 exons
spanning 23.3 kb and results in 4 different transcripts. The A and B
isoforms are encoded by exons 2 to 8 or 9, and the C and D isoforms are
encoded by exons 6 to 13 and exons 13 to 16, respectively.

MAPPING

By positional cloning, Schneider et al. (2009) mapped the PDZD7 gene to
chromosome 10q24.3.

GENE FUNCTION

By GST pull-down assay and Western blot analysis, Schneider et al.
(2009) showed that PDZD7 interacted with SANS (USH1G; 607696) in HEK293T
cells. GST pull-down assay in mouse retina showed that PDZD7 also
interacted with harmonin (USH1C; 605242).

Ebermann et al. (2010) performed a yeast 2-hybrid screen of human fetal
brain and observed interaction of the PDZ2 domain of PDZD7 with the
C-terminal intracellular domain of GPR98 (602851), including its
PDZ-binding motif. Coimmunoprecipitation studies confirmed the
interaction and revealed that it is mediated by the PDZ2 domain of PDZD7
and the PDZ-binding motif of GPR98. In addition, coimmunoprecipitation
studies demonstrated interaction of the first and second PDZ domains of
PDZD7 with USH2A (608400); a truncated version of USH2A without the
C-terminal PDZ-binding motif showed reduced interaction.

CYTOGENETICS

In a boy with nonsyndromic congenital sensorineural hearing impairment,
born of consanguineous parents, Schneider et al. (2009) identified a
homozygous reciprocal 46,XY t(10;11),t(10;11) translocation. Examination
did not show any signs of retinitis pigmentosa or vestibular dysfunction
at age 8 years. Both parents and their 4 other children were
heterozygous translocation carriers. FISH analysis localized the
breakpoints to chromosome 10q24.3 in intron 10 of the PDZD7 gene and to
chromosome 11q23.3 in close proximity (less than 5 Mb) to 2 other
nonsyndromic deafness genes, RDX (179410) and TECTA (602574). The
10q24.3 breakpoint would disrupt the open reading frame of the C and D
isoforms of PDZD7. Schneider et al. (2009) suggested that the PDZD7 gene
can cause nonsyndromic autosomal recessive deafness and is also a prime
candidate gene for Usher syndrome (see 276900).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Modifier of Retinal Disease in Usher Syndrome Type IIA

In 2 French Canadian sisters with USH2A (276901), Ebermann et al. (2010)
analyzed the PDZD7 gene and identified heterozygosity for a de novo
frameshift mutation (612971.0001) in 1 of the sisters, who had
earlier-onset and more severe retinal disease. The authors concluded
that PDZD7 is a retinal disease modifier in patients with USH2A.

- Usher Syndrome Type IIC, GPR98/PDZD7 Digenic

In a 51-year-old German man with type II Usher syndrome (see USH2C,
605472) who was negative for mutation in the Usher syndrome genes USH2A
(608400), WHRN (607928), and CLRN1 (606397), Ebermann et al. (2010)
identified a heterozygous frameshift mutation in the GPR98 gene
(602851.0010) and a heterozygous frameshift mutation in the PDZD7 gene
(612971.0002). No second mutant allele was detected in GPR98 or PDZD7.

ANIMAL MODEL

Ebermann et al. (2010) characterized pdzd7 in zebrafish and identified 2
orthologs, pdzd7a and pdzd7b, which were expressed in retinal cells and
mechanosensory hair cells of the inner ear. Functional studies of the
ortholog with higher expression, pdzd7a, demonstrated localization in
the connecting cilium region of photoreceptors as well as in the apical
region of hair cells in the inner ear and neuromasts in young fish.
Strong pdzd7a localization at the ciliary base as well as more diffuse
labeling of photoreceptor outer segments persisted in adult retinas,
indicating postdevelopmental function. Morpholino knockdown of pdzd7a
produced Usher-like symptoms that had previously been described in
zebrafish Usher gene mutations, including circling, reduced startle
reflex, and disorganized stereocilia. Half-strength morpholino knockdown
produced no impairment of balance or retinal cell survival when used
alone, whereas combined partial pdzd7a;gpr98 knockdown produced
Usher-like circling and retinal degeneration. In addition, no Usher-like
phenotype was observed in combined partial pdzd7a;ush2a knockdown.
However, knockdowns of either ush2a or pdzd7a alone produced similar
moderate levels of photoreceptor cell death, and this degeneration
increased dramatically when embryos were treated with a full dose of
ush2a morpholino combined with a half dose of pdzd7a morpholino. The
cell death observed in these retinas was restricted to the
photoreceptors, and the retinas were otherwise morphologically normal.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RETINAL DISEASE IN USHER SYNDROME TYPE IIA, MODIFIER OF
PDZD7, 1-BP INS, 166C

Ebermann et al. (2010) analyzed the PDZD7 gene in 2 French Canadian
sisters with USH2A (276901) who were homozygous for a frameshift
mutation in the USH2A gene (608400.0003), and identified heterozygosity
for an additional de novo 1-bp insertion (166insC) in the PDZD7 gene in
1 of the sisters, who had earlier-onset and more severe retinal disease.
The PDZD7 mutation was not present in the less-affected sister or in 254
controls.

.0002
USHER SYNDROME, TYPE IIC, GPR98/PDZD7 DIGENIC
PDZD7, 9-BP INS, NT2194

In a 51-year-old German man with Usher syndrome (see USH2C; 605472),
Ebermann et al. (2010) identified a heterozygous 9-bp deletion
(2194_2203del) in the PDZD7 gene and a heterozygous frameshift mutation
in the GPR98 gene (602851.0010). No second mutant allele was detected in
GPR98 or PDZD7. His unaffected sister was heterozygous for the PDZD7
mutation but did not carry the GPR98 mutation; the PDZD7 mutation was
not found in 405 controls.
