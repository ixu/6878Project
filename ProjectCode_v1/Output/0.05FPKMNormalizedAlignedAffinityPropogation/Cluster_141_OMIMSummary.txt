602104	TITLE *602104 SH3 DOMAIN-BINDING PROTEIN 2; SH3BP2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Bell et al. (1997) isolated a 2.4-kb cDNA clone corresponding to the
mouse Sh3bp2 gene from a human fetal brain cDNA library. The deduced
561-residue protein contains an Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, an Src
homology 3 (SH3)-binding domain, and a pleckstrin (173570) homology
domain, suggesting a possible role in signal transduction.

GENE STRUCTURE

The SH3BP2 gene contains 13 exons and spans approximately 16 kb (Bell et
al., 1997).

MAPPING

Bell et al. (1997) determined that the SH3BP2 gene maps to chromosome
4p16.3.

GENE FUNCTION

Bell et al. (1997) noted that SH3BP2 is a gene of interest in cancer
because of potential negative regulation of the ABL (189980) oncogene.
However, mutational analysis and expression studies in bladder cancer
samples found no evidence that this gene is a tumor suppressor gene
involved in bladder cancer.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 12 families with cherubism (118400), an autosomal
dominant disorder characterized by excessive bone degradation of the
upper and lower jaws, Ueki et al. (2001) identified mutations in the
SH3BP2 gene (see, e.g., 602104.0001-602104.0007). All mutations were
located in exon 9 and affected 3 amino acids within a 6-amino acid
sequence (RSPPDG) located 31 to 36 amino acids upstream of the SH2
domain and 205 to 210 amino acids downstream of the SH3-binding domain.
Mutations in pro418 were the most common and occurred in 8 families. The
results and the clustering of mutations in SH3BP2 supported the
hypothesis that the mutations in SH3BP2 lead to a gain of function or
act in a dominant-negative manner.

ANIMAL MODEL

Ueki et al. (2007) found that mice with a P416R mutation in the Sh3bp2
gene, which is equivalent to P418R in humans (602104.0002), showed
trabecular bone loss, osteoporosis, increased numbers of osteoclasts,
TNF-alpha (191160)-dependent systemic macrophage inflammation, and
cortical bone erosion. The phenotype was more evident in homozygous
mice. Cellular studies showed that mutant myeloid cells showed increased
responses to M-CSF (120420) and RANKL (602642) stimulation and formed
macrophages that expressed high levels of TNF-alpha. There was also
increased phosphorylation of SYK kinase (600085). Ueki et al. (2007)
concluded that cherubism is primarily a consequence of abnormal gain of
myeloid cell function and that SH3BP2 is a critical regulator of myeloid
cell responses.

gene, resulting in a gly420-to-arg (G420R) substitution. In this family,
G420R was caused by the change of GGG (gly) to AGG (arg); a family in
which G420R was caused by a change from GGG to CGG (arg) had previously
been reported (Ueki et al., 2001). The manifestations were on the whole
milder than those of many published cases (see, e.g., Figure 1 in Ueki
et al. (2001)). One transmitting female was judged to be unaffected. In
the proband, the diagnosis had been made at the age of 8 years and

607003	TITLE *607003 THYMIC STROMAL LYMPHOPOIETIN; TSLP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Several cytokines, including interleukin-7 (IL7; 146660), play a key
role in the development of B lymphocytes. TSLP is a member of this
family of B cell-stimulating factors.

CLONING

By EST and genomic database screening for sequences similar to IL7,
followed by screening a lung fibroblast sarcoma cDNA library, Reche et
al. (2001) obtained a cDNA encoding TSLP. The deduced 159-amino acid
protein, which is only 43% identical to mouse Tslp, contains a
28-residue signal sequence, 6 cysteines, and 2 N-glycosylation sites.
SDS-PAGE analysis showed expression of a 23-kD protein, larger than the
predicted 15 kD, suggesting that TSLP is glycosylated. PCR analysis of a
panel of cDNA libraries and cultured cell lines indicated that
expression of a 1.3-kb TSLP transcript may be restricted to a few lung
libraries. Reche et al. (2001) also identified TSLP receptor, which is
composed of TSLPR (CRLF2; 300357) and IL7R (146661) subunits. Dendritic
cells (DCs) and monocytes coexpress IL7R and TSLPR.

Quentmeier et al. (2001) also cloned and characterized TSLP. They noted
the presence of 7 basic C-terminal amino acids (KKRRKRK) in the protein
and that 6 of the 7 cysteines in the mouse protein (those involved in
disulfide bond formation) are conserved in human, whereas the sites for
N-glycosylation are distinct. Northern blot analysis revealed wide
expression of an approximately 1.1-kb transcript, with highest levels in
heart, liver, testis, and prostate.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Quentmeier et al. (2001) mapped the
TSLP gene to chromosome 5 in a region showing homology of synteny to
mouse chromosome 18, where the mouse Tslp gene is localized.

GENE FUNCTION

Reche et al. (2001) showed that incubation of DCs or monocytes with TSLP
enhanced the expression of CCL17 (601520), CCL18 (603757), CCL22
(602957), and CCL19 (602227). IL7, on the other hand, induced expression
of CCL17, CCL22, and CCL19, but also CXCL8 (146930), CXCL7 (121010),
CXCL5 (600324), CXCL1 (155730), CXCL2 (139110), and CXCL3 (139111).
Functional analysis indicated that TSLP enhances the DC maturation
process, as evidenced by upregulation of DC markers and costimulatory
molecules and stronger T-cell proliferation.

By screening myeloid cell lines, Quentmeier et al. (2001) established
that an acute myeloid leukemia line, MUTZ-3, responds by proliferating
in response to TSLP. TSLP also inhibited apoptosis in these cells.
Proliferation in response to TSLP could not be attributed to the
production of other growth factors tested and could be inhibited by
relatively high concentrations of anti-IL7R. TSLP, like IL7, stimulated
phosphorylation of STAT5 (601511), but unlike IL7, it did not activate
JAK3 (600173). TSLP did not phosphorylate mitogen-activated protein
kinases (e.g., ERK1; 601795).

By flow cytometric analysis, Soumelis et al. (2002) showed that
TSLP-activated DCs (TSLP-DCs) express higher levels of HLA-DR and DCLAMP
(605883) than do nonactivated or IL7-activated DCs, and that TSLP-DCs
induce marked proliferation and expansion of allogeneic naive CD4
(186940)-positive T cells. Quantitative mRNA screening and ELISA
analysis showed that TSLP-DCs do not produce detectable proinflammatory
cytokines, but do produce high levels of TARC (CCL17) and MDC (CCL22)
chemokines, which preferentially attract CCR4 (604836)-expressing Th2
lymphocytes. TSLP-DCs induced CD4 cells to produce high amounts of IL13
(147683), IL5 (147850), and the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis
factor (TNF; 191160), but only low amounts of IL10 (124092) and
gamma-interferon (IFNG; 147570). RT-PCR analysis did not detect TSLP in
most hemopoietic cells, the exception being mast cells. Keratinocytes,
epithelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and lung fibroblasts also
expressed high levels of TSLP. Within tonsils, highest levels were in
crypt epithelial cells. Soumelis et al. (2002) suggested that TSLP may
contribute to constitutive inflammation in this tissue and sporadic
inflammation in squamous epithelium. Immunohistochemical analysis of
allergic inflammatory tissue showed high expression of TSLP in
keratinocytes of acute and chronic atopic dermatitis lesions, but no
expression in normal skin. Strong TSLP expression in atopic dermatitis
was associated with the disappearance of langerin (604862)-positive
Langerhans cells within the epidermis and the concurrent appearance of
many DCLAMP-activated DCs within the dermis, many of which expressed
langerin. Soumelis et al. (2002) proposed that TSLP expression by
keratinocytes in atopic dermatitis lesions may contribute directly to
the activation of Langerhans cells, which may migrate into the dermis
and then the draining lymph nodes where they can prime allergen-specific
Th2 responses.

Watanabe et al. (2005) reported that human Hassall corpuscles express
TSLP. Human TSLP activates thymic CD11c+ (151510) dendritic cells to
express high levels of CD80 (112203) and CD86 (601020). These
TSLP-conditioned cells are then able to induce the proliferation and
differentiation of CD4+/CD8-(186910)/CD25-(147730) thymic T cells into
CD4+/CD25+/FOXP3+ (300292) regulatory T cells. This induction depends on
peptide-MHC class II interactions and the presence of CD80 and CD86 as
well as IL2 (147680). Immunohistochemistry studies revealed that
CD25+/CTLA4+(123890) regulatory T cells associate in the thymic medulla
with activated or mature dendritic cells and TSLP-expressing Hassall
corpuscles. Watanabe et al. (2005) concluded that Hassall corpuscles
have a critical role in dendritic cell-mediated secondary positive
selection of medium to high affinity self-reactive T cells, leading to
the generation of CD4+/CD25+ regulatory T cells within the thymus.

Siracusa et al. (2011) demonstrated that TSLP promotes systemic
basophilia, that disruption of TSLP-TSLPR interactions results in
defective basophil responses, and that TSLPR-sufficient basophils can
restore TH2-cell-dependent immunity in vivo. TSLP acted directly on bone
marrow-resident progenitors to promote basophil responses selectively.
Critically, TSLP could elicit basophil responses in both IL3
(147740)-IL3R (see 308385)-sufficient and -deficient environments, and
genomewide transcriptional profiling and functional analyses identified
heterogeneity between TSLP-elicited versus IL3-elicited basophils.
Furthermore, activated human basophils expressed TSLPR, and basophils
isolated from eosinophilic esophagitis (see 610247) patients were
distinct from classical basophils. Siracusa et al. (2011) concluded that
collectively, their studies identified previously unrecognized
heterogeneity within the basophil cell lineage and indicated that
expression of TSLP may influence susceptibility to multiple allergic
diseases by regulating basophil hematopoiesis and eliciting a population
of functionally distinct basophils that promote TH2 cytokine-mediated
inflammation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

For discussion of a possible association between variation in the TSLP
gene and eosinophilic esophagitis, see EOE2 (613412).

ANIMAL MODEL

Using mice deficient in Il7r and/or the common cytokine receptor gamma
chain, Il2rg (308380), Vobhenrich et al. (2003) determined the cytokines
responsible for fetal and perinatal lymphopoiesis in the absence of Il7.
Fetal and perinatal B-cell lymphopoiesis occurred in the bone marrow of
Il2rg -/- mice until 12 weeks of age, but it was absent in Il7r -/- mice
by 4 weeks of age. Lymphopoiesis in Il7r -/- mice was restricted to
fetal liver and was dependent on the presence of Tslp. The residual
lymphopoiesis that occurred in Il7r -/- mice was dependent on Flk2
(136351). Vobhenrich et al. (2003) concluded that TSLP is the main
factor driving IL7-independent fetal and perinatal lymphopoiesis,
although FLK2 is involved.

Using a mouse model of allergic skin inflammation elicited by repeated
epicutaneous (EC) sensitization with ovalbumin (OVA) to tape-stripped
skin, which mimics the scratching-inflicted injury associated with
atopic dermatitis (see 603165), He et al. (2008) found that Tslpr -/-
mice had reduced inflammation, with fewer eosinophils and local Th2
cytokine expression, but unchanged splenocyte secretion of these
cytokines. Addition of Tslp significantly enhanced Th2 cytokine
secretion in vitro by targeting Tlspr on antigen-specific T cells.
Intradermal injection of anti-Tlsp blocked the development of allergic
skin inflammation after EC antigen challenge of OVA-immunized wildtype
mice. He et al. (2008) proposed that TLSP is essential for
antigen-driven Th2 cytokine secretion by skin-infiltrating effector T
cells.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Lahn and Page (1997) isolated PRY2 among testis cDNAs corresponding to
genes located in the nonrecombining portion of the Y chromosome. PRY2 is
1 of 3 PRY genes they identified in this region. Northern blot analysis
of several tissues detected PRY expression only in testis.

MAPPING

By analysis of a panel of partial Y chromosomes, Lahn and Page (1997)
mapped PRY genes to regions 6C (PRY2) and 6E (PRY1; 400019) on the long
arm of the Y chromosome, and to region 4A on Yp. Skaletsky et al. (2003)
determined that the region of chromosome Yq containing PRY1 and PRY2 is
palindromic.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Repping et al. (2004) identified the b2/b3 deletion within the AZFc
region (415000) of the Y chromosome, in which both PRY1 and PRY2 are
deleted. The b2/b3 deletion has no obvious effect on fitness.

603153	TITLE *603153 RAD1, S. POMBE, HOMOLOG OF; RAD1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In the fission yeast S. pombe, the rad1+ gene product is required for
DNA repair and replication. Parker et al. (1998) cloned 2 alternatively
spliced human cDNAs encoding proteins with significant homology to yeast
rad1+. The longer cDNA, called Hrad1A, encodes a 282-amino acid
polypeptide, while Hrad1B encodes a 163-amino acid polypeptide. Northern
blot analysis revealed that human RAD1 is expressed as mRNAs of 5, 3,
and 1.3 kb in a variety of human tissues, with higher levels present in
some cancer cell lines. Northern blot analysis of cells subjected to
ultraviolet radiation demonstrated that human RAD1 expression is not
induced in response to DNA damage. Purified RAD1 exhibited terminal
exonuclease activity on double-stranded DNA, with a preference for
3-prime ends.

Independently, Udell et al. (1998) isolated RAD1 cDNAs from a
spontaneously transformed human keratinocyte cDNA library. The cDNAs
encode the 282-amino acid RAD1 isoform, which is 90% and 27% identical
to mouse Rad1 and S. pombe rad1+, respectively. Udell et al. (1998)
found that expression of human RAD1 in yeast rad1 mutants partially
restores radiation resistance and G2 checkpoint proficiency.

GENE FUNCTION

Volkmer and Karnitz (1999) demonstrated that the human RAD1 and HUS1
(603760) proteins associate in a complex that interacts with a highly
modified form of RAD9 (603761). They concluded that these 3 proteins are
central components of a DNA damage-responsive protein complex in human
cells.

MAPPING

Parker et al. (1998) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to map the
RAD1 gene to human chromosome 5p13.3-p13.2. The authors stated that loss
of heterozygosity (LOH) of this region has been linked to a variety of
human neoplasias. This mapping assignment was confirmed by Dean et al.
(1998) using fluorescence in situ hybridization and radiation hybrid
analysis.

180903	TITLE *180903 RYANODINE RECEPTOR 3; RYR3
;;RYANODINE RECEPTOR, BRAIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ryanodine receptors, such as RYR3, are intracellular calcium ion release
channels responsible for the release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores
following transduction of many different extracellular stimuli.

CLONING

Hakamata et al. (1992) deduced the complete amino acid sequence of a
novel ryanodine receptor/calcium release channel from rabbit brain by
cloning and sequence analysis of the cDNA. The protein was composed of
4,872 amino acids and shared characteristic structural features with the
skeletal muscle (RYR1; 180901) and cardiac (RYR2; 180902) ryanodine
receptors. RNA blot hybridization analysis showed that the brain
ryanodine receptor is abundantly expressed in corpus striatum, thalamus,
and hippocampus, whereas the cardiac ryanodine receptor is more
uniformly expressed in the brain. The brain ryanodine receptor gene was
also transcribed in smooth muscle.

Using rabbit Ryr3 cDNA as probe, Nakashima et al. (1997) cloned RYR3
from a brain cDNA library. The deduced 4,866-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of about 551 kD. RYR3 contains 4 repeated
sequences organized into 2 tandem pairs, as well as 4 highly hydrophobic
C-terminal segments. It does not have an N-terminal signal sequence.
Northern blot analysis detected a 16-kb transcript expressed at high
levels in caudate nucleus, amygdala, and hippocampus, and at lower
levels in corpus callosum, substantia nigra, and thalamus. Abundant
expression was also detected in skeletal muscle, and a faint signal was
detected in heart.

Leeb and Brenig (1998) isolated overlapping human RYR3 clones from a
random primed fetal brain cDNA library. The gene encodes a 4,870-amino
acid polypeptide that contains 4 RYR repeats, 3 SPRY domains, an ATP/GTP
binding site consensus sequence, and 3 potential calmodulin-binding
sites. They identified an alternatively spliced transcript that encodes
a truncated protein.

Jiang et al. (2003) identified 7 alternatively spliced variants of
rabbit Ryr3 that were expressed in a tissue-specific manner.

GENE FUNCTION

By functional expression of RYR3 and a chimeric RYR, Nakashima et al.
(1997) confirmed that RYR3 forms a calcium release channel with low
Ca(2+) sensitivity.

Jiang et al. (2003) characterized several rabbit Ryr3 splice variants.
One variant lacked a predicted transmembrane helix encoded by exon 92
and was highly expressed in smooth muscle tissues, but not in skeletal
muscle, heart, or brain. This variant did not form a functional Ca(2+)
channel when expressed alone in HEK293 cells, but it formed functional
heteromeric channels with reduced caffeine sensitivity when coexpressed
with wildtype Ryr3. This variant was also able to form heteromeric
channels with and suppress the activity of Ryr2 in a dominant-negative
manner. Jiang et al. (2003) concluded that the heterogeneity of Ryr3
splice variants may explain the unique tissue-specific pharmacologic and
functional properties of Ryr3.

MAPPING

By isotopic in situ hybridization, Sorrentino et al. (1993) mapped the
RYR3 gene to 15q14-q15; 15q15 is a probable location. By in situ
hybridization, Mattei et al. (1994) mapped the type 3 ryanodine receptor
to mouse chromosome 2E5-2F3. Richard et al. (1994) presented an
integrated physical, expression, and genetic map of chromosome 15. They
found that the RYR3 gene fell in their region I: 15pter-q14.

ANIMAL MODEL

Takeshima et al. (1996), Bertocchini et al. (1997), and Futatsugi et al.
(1999) independently generated Ryr3-deficient mice. In all cases, the
homozygous mutant mice were fertile and displayed no gross
abnormalities. Takeshima et al. (1996) detected increased locomotor
activity in Ryr3 knockout mice compared to that of the control mice and
concluded that the lack of Ryr3-mediated Ca(2+) signaling results in
abnormalities of certain neurons in the central nervous system.

Bertocchini et al. (1997) detected normal Ryr3 expression in murine
skeletal muscles during the postnatal phase of muscle development, but
not in muscles of adult mice, with the exception of the diaphragm and
soleus muscles. The authors demonstrated that skeletal muscle
contraction in Ryr3 knockout mice was impaired during the first weeks
after birth. They concluded that Ryr3 has a physiologic role in
excitation-contraction coupling of neonatal skeletal muscles.

Futatsugi et al. (1999) measured the electrophysiologic and
pharmacologic properties of synaptic plasticity in the CA1 area of
Ryr3-deficient mice. The results suggested that Ryr3-mediated
intracellular calcium release from endoplasmic reticulum may inhibit
hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and spatial learning.

Barone et al. (1998) generated double mutant mice carrying a targeted
disruption of both the Ryr1 and Ryr3 genes. Skeletal muscles from mice
homozygous for both mutations did not contract in response to caffeine
or ryanodine. In addition, these muscles showed very low tension when
directly activated with micromolar ionized calcium after membrane
permeabilization, indicating either poor development or degeneration of
the myofibrils. This was confirmed by biochemical analysis of
contractile proteins. Electron microscopy confirmed small size of
myofibrils and showed complete absence of feet (RyRs) in the junctional
sarcoplasmic reticulum.

Balschun et al. (1999) found that hippocampal tissue from Ryr3 knockout
mice showed no morphologic changes and had robust in vitro LTP induced
by repeated strong tetanization in the CA1 region, similar to control
tissue. However, the hippocampal tissue from the mutant mice showed
significantly impaired initial amplitude of potentiation and LTP
maintenance in response to weak tetanization compared to controls. In a
water maze test, the mutant animals showed normal learning acquisition
but had deficits in spatial learning, suggesting impaired synaptic
plasticity. Balschun et al. (1999) concluded that RYR3 has a functional
role in hippocampal synaptic plasticity, specifically on the adaptation
of acquired memory in response to external changes or stimuli.

603200	TITLE *603200 REGULATORY FACTOR X, ANKYRIN REPEAT-CONTAINING; RFXANK
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Major histocompatibility (MHC) class II molecules are transmembrane
proteins that have a central role in development and control of the
immune system. They are encoded by a multigene family and their
expression is tightly regulated. MHC class II deficiency (209920) is an
autosomal recessive immunodeficiency syndrome resulting from defects in
transacting factors essential for transcription of MHC class II genes.
There are 4 genetic complementation groups (A, B, C, and D), reflecting
the existence of 4 MHC class II regulators. The factor defective in
group A is CIITA, or MHC class II transactivator (MHCTA; 600005); in
group C, regulatory factor-5 (RFX5; 601863); and in group D, regulatory
factor X-associated protein (RFXAP; 601861). CIITA is a non-DNA-binding
coactivator that controls the cell type specificity and inducibility of
MHC class II expression. RFX5 and RFXAP are 2 subunits of RFX, a
multiprotein complex that binds the X box motif of MHC class II
promoters. Mutations in the genes encoding RFX5 or RFXAP abolish binding
of RFX to DNA. Similar to groups C and D, group B is characterized by a
defect in RFX binding, and although it accounts for the majority of
patients, the factor defective in group B remained unknown until
Masternak et al. (1998) isolated RFX by a novel single-step DNA-affinity
purification approach and identified RFXANK, the gene encoding the third
subunit of RFX. RFXANK restored MHC class II expression in cell lines
from patients in group B and was found to be mutated in these patients.
RFXANK contains a protein-protein interaction region consisting of 3
ankyrin repeats. Its interaction with RFX5 and RFXAP is essential for
binding of the RFX complex to MHC class II promoters. The gene was
symbolized RFXANK because the protein contains 3 ankyrin repeats.
Wiszniewski et al. (2000) stated that, since the first description of
combined immunodeficiency due to absence of MHC class II molecule
expression, about 70 patients from 50 families had been reported. Of the
4 complementation groups described, the largest had been group B. Most
of the patients in this category had been of North African origin.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Nekrep et al. (2000) demonstrated a direct interaction between the C
terminus of RFXAP and RFXANK; mutant RFXAP or RFXANK proteins failed to
bind. The authors found that RFX5 binds only to the RFXANK-RFXAP
scaffold and not to either protein alone. However, neither the scaffold
nor RFX5 alone can bind DNA. Nekrep et al. (2000) concluded that the
binding of the RFXANK-RFXAP scaffold to RFX5 leads to a conformational
change in the latter that exposes the DNA-binding domain of RFX5. The
DNA-binding domain of RFX5 anchors the RFX complex to the MHC class II X
and S promoter boxes. Another part of the RFX5 protein interacts with
MHC2TA. The authors pointed out that mutation of either protein in
complementation group B or group D of BLS patients prevents its binding
to the other protein, explaining why MHC class II promoters are bare in
the bare lymphocyte syndrome.

GENE STRUCTURE

Masternak et al. (1998) found that the RFXANK gene is composed of 10
exons spanning approximately 10 kb.

MAPPING

Masternak et al. (1998) reported that the RFXANK gene is located on
19p12 between MEF2B (600661) and CSPG3 (600826). This mapping was
accomplished by genomic DNA sequence information which referred them to
specific cosmids that were part of the Lawrence-Livermore chromosome 19
sequencing work.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Lennon-Dumenil et al. (2001) described a patient of North African origin
with the classic features of MHC class II deficiency. The patient had a
homozygous mutation affecting a splice donor site downstream of exon 4
of the RFXANK gene (603200.0003), resulting in a premature stop codon
and an inactive protein lacking all 3 ankyrin domains. Northern and
Western blot analyses of a cell line established from the patient
revealed a lack of expression of HLA-DPA (142880), HLA-DRB (142857),
HLA-DQB (604305), and HLA-DPB (142858), but near normal expression of
HLA-DRA (142860) and HLA-DQA (146880). The authors identified an
alternatively spliced RFXANK gene product that lacks exon 4, resulting
in a 28-amino acid deletion, and complementation and cytofluorometric
analyses confirmed that this alternative RFXANK cDNA could rescue
HLA-DRA and HLA-DRB expression.

Wiszniewski et al. (2003) stated that 7 different RFXANK mutations had
been reported in 26 unrelated patients with MHC class II deficiency.
They reported 2 novel mutations, including D121V (603200.0004),
resulting in loss of function of the gene.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
BARE LYMPHOCYTE SYNDROME, TYPE II, COMPLEMENTATION GROUP B
RFXANK, 26-BP DEL, NT752

In 2 unrelated patients with bare lymphocyte syndrome type II,
complementation group B (209920), Masternak et al. (1998) found a 26-bp
deletion of genomic DNA that removed the splice acceptor site and the
first nucleotide of exon 6 of the RFXANK gene. In 1 of these families,
reported by Lisowska-Grospierre et al. (1994), the parents were known to
be consanguineous. In both families, homozygosity was confirmed by
analysis of DNA from other family members.

Wiszniewski et al. (2000) performed a mutation analysis in 20 additional
patients belonging to complementation group B and detected the 26-bp
deletion beginning with 752G in 17 patients, all of North African
origin. A founder effect was documented, since all tested patients,
except 1, displayed a common haplotype spanning the RFXANK locus.

.0002
BARE LYMPHOCYTE SYNDROME, TYPE II, COMPLEMENTATION GROUP B
RFXANK, 58-BP DEL

In a patient with bare lymphocyte syndrome type II, complementation type
B (209920), Masternak et al. (1998) found a 58-bp deletion of genomic
DNA that removed the last 23 nucleotides and the splice donor site of
exon 6 of the RFXANK gene.

.0003
BARE LYMPHOCYTE SYNDROME, TYPE II, COMPLEMENTATION GROUP B
RFXANK, IVS4DS, G-C, +1

Lennon-Dumenil et al. (2001) described a patient of North African origin
with MHC class II deficiency (209920). The patient had a homozygous 1-bp
transversion (G to C) that abolished the splice site downstream of exon
4 of the RFXANK gene, resulting in a premature stop codon and an
inactive protein lacking all 3 ankyrin domains. Northern and Western
blot analyses of a cell line established from the patient revealed a
lack of expression of HLA-DPA (142880), HLA-DRB (142857), HLA-DQB
(604305), and HLA-DPB (142858), but near normal expression of HLA-DRA
(142860) and HLA-DQA (146880). The authors identified an alternatively
spliced RFXANK gene product that lacks exon 4, resulting in a 28-amino
acid deletion, and complementation and cytofluorometric analyses
confirmed that this alternative RFXANK cDNA could rescue HLA-DRA and
HLA-DRB expression.

.0004
BARE LYMPHOCYTE SYNDROME, TYPE II, COMPLEMENTATION GROUP B
RFXANK, ASP121VAL

Wiszniewski et al. (2003) identified an asp121-to-val (D121V) missense
mutation in the RFXANK gene. The D121V mutant was unable to form the RFX
complex, indicating that D121 is required for RFXAP binding.

608726	TITLE *608726 PHOSPHATASE AND ACTIN REGULATOR 4; PHACTR4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to rat Phactr1 (608723),
Allen et al. (2004) identified a family of 4 PHACTR genes in mouse and
human, including PHACTR4. The PHACTR proteins share highest similarity
in sequences surrounding the N- and C-terminal RPEL repeats and in the
C-terminal actin- and protein phosphatase-1 (PP1; see 176875)-binding
domains. In situ hybridization of rat brain showed Phactr4 highly
expressed in periventricular regions, cerebellum, and hippocampus.

GENE FUNCTION

Allen et al. (2004) determined that mouse Phactr4 coprecipitated with
both PP1 and actin following expression in human embryonic kidney cells.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PHACTR4
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP SHGC-74491).

ANIMAL MODEL

Using N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis screens, Kim et al. (2007)
isolated the 'humpty dumpty' (humdy) mutant mouse line, which showed
failure to close the neural tube and optic fissure, causing exencephaly
and retinal coloboma. Homozygous humdy embryos exhibited complete
exencephaly, and most died by embryonic day 14.5, although a few
survived to birth and died shortly thereafter. About 8% of heterozygous
embryos displayed a midbrain-specific exencephaly, indicating an
incompletely penetrant dominant effect. Humdy was due to a missense
mutation in the Pp1-binding domain of Phactr4 that specifically
disrupted binding of Pp1 to Phactr4, leading to increased inhibitory
phosphorylation of thr320 on Pp1 in the ventral neural tube and eye and
disruption of Pp1 activity toward its target, Rb (RB1; 614041).
Consequently, Rb became hyperphosphorylated and inactivated, leading to
derepression of E2f (see E2F1; 189971) target genes. Loss of Phactr4
function resulted in shortening of the cell cycle, an increase in
proliferating neural progenitors, and ectopic cell division and/or cell
cycle exit defects in differentiating cells of the humdy neural tube and
retina. Loss of a single E2f1 allele rescued the exencephaly, coloboma,
and proliferation/differentiation defects of humdy mice, indicating that
the critical target of Phactr4 is the cell cycle regulator E2f1.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NHE3 (SLC9A3; 182307) is a sodium/hydrogen exchanger in the brush border
membrane of the proximal tubule, small intestine, and colon that plays a
major role in transepithelial sodium absorption. SLC9A3R2, as well as
SLC9A3R1 (604990) and protein kinase A phosphorylation, may play a role
in NHE3 regulation.

CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a HeLa cell cDNA library with SRY
(480000) as bait, Poulat et al. (1997) obtained a cDNA encoding
SLC9A3R2, which they termed SIP1. The deduced 326-amino acid protein
contains 2 highly conserved PDZ domains. Northern blot analysis revealed
wide expression of SLC9A3R2, suggesting a function not restricted to the
sex-determination process. Western blot analysis showed expression of a
34-kD protein. Binding and mutational analyses confirmed the interaction
of the PDZ domains of SLC9A3R2 with the C terminus of SRY.
Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated nuclear expression of
SLC9A3R2.

By means of a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a lung fibroblast cDNA library
with the cytoplasmic tail of NHE3 as bait, Yun et al. (1997) isolated a
cDNA encoding SLC9A3R2, which they designated E3KARP. Sequence analysis
predicted that the 337-amino acid protein is 55% identical to SLC9A3R1
(Reczek et al., 1997). Yun et al. (1997) concluded that either E3KARP or
EBP50 (SLC9A3R1) is necessary for the cAMP-dependent inhibition of NHE3.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Hall et al. (1998) determined that the DS/TxL motif at the cytoplasmic
tail of the beta-2 adrenergic receptor (ADRB2; 109690), P2Y1 (601167),
and CFTR (602421) is necessary for interaction with the first PDZ domain
of NHERF (SLC9A3R1) and NHERF2. They suggested that the presence of this
motif at the C terminus of a variety of proteins is a useful indicator
of potential NHERF binding to intracellular proteins.

Yun et al. (1998) showed that a central domain of NHE3, not a C-terminal
domain, interacts with NHERF2 through its second PDZ domain plus its C
terminus. Confocal microscopy demonstrated predominantly cytosolic
expression of NHERF2 in the absence of NHE3, with more plasma membrane
expression in the presence of NHE3. Gel overlay analysis showed that, as
seen with NHERF, the N terminus of ezrin (VIL2; 123900) interacts with
the C-terminal residues of NHERF2.

GENE FUNCTION

Mahon et al. (2002) demonstrated that parathyroid hormone receptor-1
(PTHR1; 168468) binds to the sodium/hydrogen exchanger regulatory
factors NHERF1 (604990) and NHERF2 through a PDZ-domain interaction in
vitro and in PTH target cells. NHERF2 simultaneously binds phospholipase
C-beta-1 and an atypical, carboxyl-terminal PDZ consensus motif, ETVM,
of the PTHR1 through PDZ1 and PDZ2, respectively. PTH treatment of cells
that express the NHERF2-PTH1R complex markedly activated phospholipase
C-beta and inhibits adenylylcyclase through stimulation of inhibitory G
proteins (see 139310). NHERF-mediated assembly of PTHR1 and
phospholipase C-beta is a unique mechanism to regulate PTH signaling in
cells and membranes of polarized cells that express NHERF, which may
account for many tissue- and cell-specific actions of PTH/PTH-related
protein (168470) and may also be relevant to signaling by many G
protein-coupled receptors.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a human brain cDNA expression library,
DeMarco et al. (2002) found that PCMA2b (108733) interacted with NHERF2.
Coimmunoprecipitation analysis indicated that the interaction was
specific and selective, in that PCMA4b (108732) did not interact with
either NHERF2 or NHERF1, and PCMA2b preferred NHERF2 over NHERF1.
Fluorescence-tagged PCMA2b was expressed at the apical membrane of
canine kidney epithelial cells, where it colocalized with apically
targeted NHERF2. DeMarco et al. (2002) hypothesized that the
PCMA2b-NHERF2 interaction may allow the assembly of PMCA2b in a
multiprotein Ca(2+) signaling complex.

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a rat glomerular cDNA library, Takeda
et al. (2001) found that the PDZ-binding motif in the cytoplasmic
C-terminal tail of rat podocalyxin (PODXL; 602632) bound the second PDZ
domain of Nherf2. Immunocytochemical analysis colocalized Nherf2 with
podocalyxin and ezrin along the apical domain of the glomerular
epithelial cell membrane. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis showed that
Nherf2 and ezrin formed a multimeric complex with podocalyxin. The
complex interacted with the actin cytoskeleton, and this interaction was
disrupted in glomerular epithelial cells from rats treated with agents
that cause loss of foot processes. Takeda et al. (2001) concluded that
NHERF2 functions as a scaffold protein linking podocalyxin to ezrin and
the actin cytoskeleton.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis of the 3-prime-flanking sequence of the NTHL1 gene
(602656), Imai et al. (1998) mapped the SLC9A3R2 gene to an adjacent
region on chromosome 16p13.3.

602644	TITLE *602644 TETRASPANIN 4; TSPAN4
;;TRANSMEMBRANE 4 SUPERFAMILY, MEMBER 7; TM4SF7;;
TETRASPAN;;
NOVEL ANTIGEN 2; NAG2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TSPAN4 belongs to the large family of tetraspanins, so named because
they contain 4 transmembrane domains. Tetraspanins are frequently
expressed at the cell surface in association with each other and with
other molecules, such as integrins (see ITGB1; 135630), and they
function to regulate cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and
differentiation (summary by Todd et al., 1998).

CLONING

Tachibana et al. (1997) generated monoclonal antibodies against proteins
that coimmunoprecipitated with CD81 (TAPA1; 186845) from a human breast
cancer cell line. Two antibodies recognized a 28- to 35-kD protein,
which Tachibana et al. (1997) named NAG2 for 'novel antigen-2.' Using
the antibodies to screen a cDNA expression library derived from the
breast cancer cell line, the authors cloned cDNAs encoding NAG2. The
predicted 238-amino acid NAG2 protein contains 4 hydrophobic domains and
shows homology to transmembrane 4 superfamily (TM4SF) proteins. Northern
blot analysis detected a 1.5-kb NAG2 mRNA, and together with flow
cytometry and immunohistochemistry, showed that NAG2 was expressed in
multiple tissues but was absent in brain, lymphoid cells, and platelets.
Immunofluorescence analysis showed that NAG2 colocalized with CD81 on
the cell surface. Tachibana et al. (1997) identified mouse ESTs encoding
the mouse homolog of NAG2. The human and mouse NAG2 proteins have 95%
amino acid identity.

By searching an EST database for sequences containing a tetraspanin
consensus sequence, Todd et al. (1998) identified human TSPAN4. The
deduced 238-amino acid protein contains 4 transmembrane domains and
other features characteristic of tetraspanins, including conservation of
charged residues in or near the transmembrane domains, similar to ion
channels, and of 4 cysteines in the second extracellular domain.
Northern blot analysis detected highest TSPAN4 expression in heart and
placenta. EST database analysis suggested that TSPAN4 is also expressed
in brain, melanocytes, pancreas, and fetal liver/spleen, in addition to
pregnant uterus and adult and fetal heart.

GENE FUNCTION

Tachibana et al. (1997) found that NAG2 coimmunoprecipitated with
integrins and other TM4SF members, indicating that NAG2 is present in
TM4SF-TM4SF and TM4SF-integrin complexes.

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the TSPAN4 gene to chromosome 11p15.5 based on an
alignment of the TSPAN4 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF022813) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

608477	TITLE *608477 ALDO-KETO REDUCTASE FAMILY 7, MEMBER A3; AKR7A3
;;AFLATOXIN B1-ALDEHYDE REDUCTASE 2; AFAR2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Aldo-keto reductases, such as AKR7A3, are involved in the detoxification
of aldehydes and ketones.

CLONING

Using rat Akr7a3 to screen a human liver cDNA library, Knight et al.
(1999) cloned AKR7A3. The deduced 331-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 37 kD. AKR7A3 and AKR7A2 (603418) share 88%
amino acid identity. Northern blot analysis detected ubiquitous
expression of a 1.4-kb transcript, with highest expression in stomach,
pancreas, kidney, and liver. Lowest expression was in lung and
peripheral blood leukocytes. Western blot analysis detected AKR7A3 in
liver at an apparent molecular mass of 37 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Knight et al. (1999) demonstrated that bacterially expressed human
AKR7A3 was active against an AKR model substrate, 4-nitrobenzaldehyde,
over a broad pH range (pH 5 to 8), with an optimum at pH 6.6. It was
also active against 9,10-phenanthrenequinone and the toxic fungal
metabolite aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) dihydrodiol. The conversion of AFB1
dihydrodiol to ABF1 dialcohol was NADP(+)-dependent.

GENE STRUCTURE

Praml et al. (2003) determined that the AKR7A3 gene contains 7 exons and
spans 6.0 kb.

MAPPING

By FISH and genomic sequence analysis, Praml et al. (2003) mapped the
AKR7A3 gene to chromosome 1p36.1-p35, where it lies in a gene cluster
with the AKR7A2 and AKR7A4 (608478) genes. The genes are oriented in a
head-to-tail tandem arrangement,
distal-5-prime-AKR7A2-AKR7A3-AKR7A4-3-prime-proximal.

182175	TITLE *182175 SIGNAL RECOGNITION PARTICLE, 19-KD; SRP19
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The signal recognition particle (SRP) is a ribonucleoprotein complex
that mediates the targeting of proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER). The complex consists of a 7S (or 7SL) RNA and 6 different
proteins, SRP9 (600707), SRP14 (600708), SRP19, SRP54 (604857), SRP68
(604858), and SRP72 (602122). The proteins are bound to the 7S RNA as
monomers (SRP19 and SRP54) or heterodimers (SRP9/SRP14 and SRP68/SRP72).
SRP9 and SRP14 bind to the Alu domain of the SRP, whereas the other 4
proteins belong to the S domain. SRP has at least 3 distinct functions
that can be associated with the protein subunits: signal recognition,
translational arrest, and ER membrane targeting by interaction with the
docking protein.

For information on a signal recognition particle database, see Larsen et
al. (1998).

By screening a liver cDNA library with an anti-SRP19 probe, Lingelbach
et al. (1988) isolated a human SRP19 cDNA encoding a 144-amino acid
protein. Sequence analysis showed that SRP19 contains a very basic
C-terminal domain of 7 lysine residues interrupted by 2 glycine
residues. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a 0.9 kb
transcript in HeLa cells. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that SRP19 is
expressed as a 19-kD protein, identical in size to canine SRP19.
Functional analysis determined that the SRP19 protein binds to 7SL RNA
in canine pancreas.

GENE STRUCTURE

Groden et al. (1991) determined that the SRP19 gene consists of 5 exons.

GENE FUNCTION

In 2 small nested deletions of 100 to 260 kb identified by Joslyn et al.
(1991) in patients with adenomatous polyposis coli (APC; 175100), Groden
et al. (1991) identified 3 genes in a span of about 100 kb on chromosome
5. One of these was DP1 (125265); a second was the gene that is mutant
in APC, called by them DP2.5 (611731). The third was a gene which was
found to have the same sequence as that of SRP19. Horii et al. (1993)
discussed the occurrence of alternative splicing not only within the APC
gene but also between the APC gene and the neighboring SRP19 gene.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Wild et al. (2001) reported the 1.8-angstrom resolution crystal
structure of human SRP19 in complex with its primary binding site on
helix 6 of SRP RNA, which consists of a stem-loop structure closed by an
unusual GGAG tetraloop. Protein-RNA interactions are mediated by the
specific recognition of a widened major groove and the tetraloop without
any direct protein-base contacts and include a complex network of highly
ordered water molecules. Wild et al. (2001) proposed a model of the
assembly of the SRP core comprising SRP19, SRP54, and SRP RNA based on
crystallographic and biochemical data.

Halic et al. (2004) presented the structure of a targeting complex
consisting of mammalian SRP bound to an active 80S ribosome carrying a
signal sequence. This structure, determined to 12-angstrom resolution by
cryoelectron microscopy, enabled Halic et al. (2004) to generate a
molecular model of SRP in its functional conformation. The model showed
how the S domain of SRP contacts the large ribosomal subunit at the
nascent chain exit site to bind the signal sequence, and that the Alu
domain reaches into the elongation factor-binding site of the ribosome,
explaining its elongation arrest activity.

MAPPING

The SRP19 gene maps to chromosome 5q21-q22, between the DP1 (125265) and
APC (611731) genes (Groden et al., 1991).

608503	TITLE *608503 POLY(rC)-BINDING PROTEIN 4; PCBP4
;;ALPHA-CP4;;
MCG10
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The poly(rC)-binding proteins are a subfamily of KH-domain-containing
RNA-binding proteins that bind C-rich pyrimidine tracts and play pivotal
roles in a broad spectrum of posttranscriptional events (Chkheidze and
Liebhaber, 2003).

CLONING

By subtraction hybridization for genes induced by p53 (191170) in a lung
cancer cell line, Zhu and Chen (2000) cloned PCBP4, which they
designated MCG10. They also identified an alternatively spliced
transcript, which they designated MCG10as. The deduced proteins contain
424 and 369 amino acids. Each protein contains an N-terminal KH (HNRNPK
(600712)-homology) domain, a C-terminal KH domain, 3 proline-rich
domains, a potential nuclear export signal, and a potential nuclear
localization signal.

Based on its sequence similarity with mouse and human PCBP2 (601210),
Makeyev and Liebhaber (2000) cloned mouse Pcbp4, and using this sequence
as query to search an EST database, they identified human PCBP4. Both
mouse and human PCBP4 encode 403-amino acid proteins with calculated
molecular masses of 41.5 kD. PCBP4 contains 2 KH domains in the
N-terminal half, and 1 near the C terminus. Quantitative RT-PCR detected
expression in all mouse tissues examined.

Chkheidze and Liebhaber (2003) cloned a PCBP4 transcript that encodes a
deduced 329-amino acid protein. Epitope-tagged PCBP4 localized to the
cytosol of transfected HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhu and Chen (2000) found that PCBP4 was induced following p53
expression in a lung cancer cell line. Expression of a p53 mutant
defective in transactivation, and a p53 lacking the proline-rich domain,
did not induce PCBP4 expression. Chemically-induced DNA damage also led
to p53-dependent PCBP4 upregulation. By generating cell lines that
inducibly expressed either wildtype or mutated forms of the 2 PCBP4
splice variants, Zhu and Chen (2000) found that both variants suppressed
cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in
G(2)-M. Through their KH domains, both variants bound poly(rC) and their
RNA-binding activity was necessary to induce apoptosis and cell cycle
arrest.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhu and Chen (2000) identified 3 potential p53-binding sites in the
untranslated region upstream of the PCBP4 transcription start site.
Makeyev and Liebhaber (2000) determined that the PCBP4 gene contains 14
exons and spans 9.8 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Zhu and Chen (2000) and Makeyev and
Liebhaber (2000) mapped the PCBP4 gene to chromosome 3p21. By FISH,
Makeyev and Liebhaber (2000) mapped the mouse Pcbp4 gene to a syntenic
region of mouse chromosome 9F1-F2.

606609	TITLE *606609 3-PRIME @REPAIR EXONUCLEASE 1; TREX1
;;DNase III
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The multistep processes of DNA replication, repair, and recombination
require the excision of nucleotides from DNA 3-prime termini. Enzymes
containing 3-prime-to-5-prime exonuclease activity remove mismatched,
modified, fragmented, and normal nucleotides to generate the appropriate
3-prime termini for subsequent steps in the DNA metabolic pathways
(Mazur and Perrino, 1999).

CLONING

By micropeptide sequence analysis of the 30-kD bovine Trex1 protein, PCR
with degenerate primers, and EST database searching, Mazur and Perrino
(1999) obtained cDNAs encoding mouse and human TREX1 and TREX2 (300370).
Sequence analysis predicted that the 304-amino acid TREX1 protein is 44%
identical to TREX2 (Mazur and Perrino (2001) corrected the TREX1
sequence to 314 amino acids). TREX1 contains 3 conserved exonuclease
motifs, with an HxAxxD sequence in the third motif. Functional analysis
confirmed that the 3-prime-to-5-prime exonuclease activity of the
recombinant protein is comparable to that of the native protein and
prefers mismatched 3-prime termini. Mazur and Perrino (1999) concluded
that the TREX proteins are small, independent 3-prime excision enzymes,
whereas the multifunctional p53 (191170) and WRN (RECQL2; 604611)
proteins, which also have 3-prime-to-5-prime exonuclease activity, are
much larger.

Using rabbit Trex1 to search an EST database, Hoss et al. (1999) also
isolated human TREX1, which they termed DNase III. Northern blot
analysis revealed expression of a 1.15-kb TREX1 transcript in all
tissues tested.

Mazur and Perrino (2001) used 5-prime RACE to identify the flanking
region of TREX1. Genomic sequence analysis suggested that TREX1 open
reading frames are produced by a variety of mechanisms, including
alternate promoter usage, alternative splicing, and varied sites for
3-prime cleavage. RT-PCR analysis detected ubiquitous expression of
TREX1.

GENE STRUCTURE

The TREX1 gene contains a single exon (Hoss et al., 1999; Mazur and
Perrino, 2001).

MAPPING

Hoss et al. (1999) and Mazur and Perrino (2001) identified clones
containing the TREX1 gene that map to chromosome 3p21.3-p21.2.

GENE FUNCTION

SET (600960) and NM23H1 (NME1; 156490) reside in an endoplasmic
reticulum-associated complex, the SET complex, that translocates to the
nucleus in response to superoxide generation by granzyme A (GZMA;
140050). Chowdhury et al. (2006) identified TREX1 as a component of the
SET complex. TREX1 bound SET and colocalized and translocated with the
SET complex. On its own, TREX1 did not damage intact DNA, but it acted
in concert with NM23H1 to destroy DNA during granzyme A-mediated cell
death. After NM23H1 nicked 1 strand, TREX1 removed bases from the free
3-prime end to enhance the damage and prevent DNA end reannealing and
repair.

Using mass spectrometry and Western blot analysis, Stetson et al. (2008)
identified mouse Trex1 as a protein involved in recognition of
interferon stimulatory DNA (ISD) BrdU-labeled intracellular
oligonucleotides. Microarray analysis showed that Trex1 was upregulated
in response to ISD stimulation. However, Trex1 -/- cells retained an
intact ISD response, ruling out Trex1 as the ISD sensor. In contrast
with Trex1 -/- mice, which succumb to lethal autoimmunity (see ANIMAL
MODEL), Trex1 -/- mice lacking Irf3 (603734), Ifnar1 (107450), or Rag2
(179616) survived and regained normal body weight through amelioration
of disease at discrete phases, indicating that TREX1 substrates are
ligands of the ISD pathway. Single-stranded DNA derived from endogenous
retroelements accumulated in Trex1 -/- cells, and Trex1 metabolized
reverse-transcribed DNA. Stetson et al. (2008) concluded that TREX1 is
an essential negative regulator of the ISD response and represents a
mechanism to prevent autoimmunity caused by endogenous retroelements.

Using mutation analysis with recombinant human TREX1, Fye et al. (2011)
found that arg174 and lys175 within the flexible loop and arg128 in the
catalytic core contributed to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and
double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) degradation. TREX1 degraded
endonuclease-treated hamster liver nuclei, suggesting that TREX1
contributes to apoptosis-associated DNA degradation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Aicardi-Goutieres Syndrome 1

In affected members of 10 families with Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome
(AGS1; 225750), Crow et al. (2006) identified 5 different mutations in
the TREX1 gene in homozygous or compound heterozygous state (see, e.g.,
606609.0001-606609.0004). One of the mutations, R114H (606609.0001), was
identified in 7 European pedigrees. Crow et al. (2006) identified a
homozygous mutation in the TREX1 gene (606609.0002) in a patient
originally diagnosed with Cree encephalitis, indicating that Cree
encephalitis is essentially the same disorder as AGS1.

Rice et al. (2007) described a de novo heterozygous TREX1 mutation,
affecting a critical catalytic residue in TREX1 (D200N; 606609.0006),
that resulted in typical Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome, thus defining a
dominant form of the disorder.

Haaxma et al. (2010) reported a second patient with Aicardi-Goutieres
syndrome and a de novo heterozygous TREX1 mutation (D18N; 606609.0007).
The D18N mutation had previously been identified in heterozygosity by
Lee-Kirsch et al. (2007) in a family with chilblain lupus.

- Susceptibility to Systemic Lupus Erythematosus

Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome shows overlap with systemic erythematosus
(SLE; 152700) at both clinical and pathologic levels. Lee-Kirsch et al.
(2007) analyzed the TREX1 gene in 417 patients with SLE and 1,712
controls and identified heterozygosity for a 3-prime UTR variant and 11
nonsynonymous changes in 12 patients (see, e.g., 606609.0001). They
found only 2 nonsynonymous changes in 2 controls (p = 1.7 X 10(-7),
relative risk = 25.3). In vitro studies of 2 frameshift mutations
revealed that both caused altered subcellular distribution.

- Chilblain Lupus

Rice et al. (2007) reported a heterozygous TREX1 mutation (606609.0005)
causing familial chilblain lupus (CHBL; 610448), a rare cutaneous form
of SLE.

In affected members of the large 5-generation German family with
chilblain lupus in which the disease was mapped to chromosome 3p21-p14
by Lee-Kirsch et al. (2006), Lee-Kirsch et al. (2007) identified
heterozygosity for a missense mutation (D18N; 606609.0007) in the TREX1
gene.

- Retinal Vasculopathy with Cerebral Leukodystrophy

In 9 families with autosomal dominant retinal vasculopathy with cerebral
leukodystrophy (192315), Richards et al. (2007) identified 5 different
heterozygous frameshift mutations at the C terminus of the TREX1 gene
(see, e.g., 606609.0008 and 606609.0009). In expression studies, the
truncated proteins retained exonuclease activity but lost normal
perinuclear localization.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

The TREX1 D200N and D18N dominant heterozygous mutations are associated
with AGS1 and CHBL, respectively. Using exonuclease enzyme analysis,
Lehtinen et al. (2008) showed that TREX1 heterodimers containing
wildtype TREX1 and either D200N or D18N mutant proteins were completely
deficient in degrading dsDNA and degraded ssDNA at an approximately
2-fold lower rate than wildtype TREX1. In addition, D200N- and
D18N-containing homo- and heterodimers inhibited the dsDNA degradation
activity of wildtype TREX1, providing an explanation for the dominant
phenotype of the mutant alleles. In contrast, the R114H mutation, which
causes AGS1 when present as a homozygous mutation and SLE when present
as a heterozygous mutation, had dysfunctional dsDNA and ssDNA
degradation activities as a homodimer, but it was functional as a
heterodimer. The R114H homodimer lacked inhibitory activity against
wildtype TREX1, supporting the recessive genetics of the R114H mutation
in AGS1. Lehtinen et al. (2008) concluded that the dysfunctional dsDNA
activities of the disease-related TREX1 mutants could account for
persistent dsDNA from dying cells leading to an aberrant autoimmune
response in these disorders.

ANIMAL MODEL

Morita et al. (2004) found that Trex1 -/- mice developed inflammatory
myocarditis, suggesting a role for this enzyme in immune regulation.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
AICARDI-GOUTIERES SYNDROME 1
SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, INCLUDED
TREX1, ARG114HIS

In affected members of 7 families of European origin with
Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome-1 (225750), Crow et al. (2006) identified a
341G-A transition in the TREX1 gene, resulting in an arg114-to-his
(R114H) substitution at a residue predicted to be involved in protein
dimerization. Five of the families were homozygous for the mutation and
2 were compound heterozygous with another TREX1 mutation (606609.0003).
Patient-derived fibroblasts showed no detectable TREX1 3-prime
exonuclease activity.

Lee Kirsch et al. (2007) analyzed the TREX1 gene in 417 patients with
systemic lupus erythematosus (152700) and identified heterozygosity for
the R114H mutation in a European female patient who had nephritis,
arthritis, and antinuclear and anti-dsDNA antibodies.

In an extensive study of the clinical and molecular phenotypes of
Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome, Rice et al. (2007) found biallelic mutations
in TREX1 in 31 of 127 families with the clinical diagnosis of the
disorder. Eighteen families, 14 of which were of northern European
origin, were homozygous (15) or compound heterozygous (3) for the 341G-A
transition (R114H). Notably, all R114H homozygotes were also homozygous
for the T allele of a SNP at position 531. This allele exhibited highly
significant (P less than 0.001) overrepresentation in patients compared
with controls (with a T allele population frequency of 0.4), suggesting
that R114H might be an ancient founder mutation.

.0002
AICARDI-GOUTIERES SYNDROME 1
TREX1, ARG164TER

In a patient with Cree encephalitis, also known as AGS1 (225750), born
of consanguineous parents, Crow et al. (2006) identified a homozygous
490C-T transition in the TREX1 gene, resulting in an arg164-to-ter
(R164X) substitution. A lymphoblastoid cell line derived from the
patient showed no detectable 3-prime exonuclease activity. The findings
confirmed that Cree encephalitis and AGS1 are essentially the same
disorder.

.0003
AICARDI-GOUTIERES SYNDROME 1
TREX1, 3-BP INS, 600GAT

In affected members of 2 unrelated families with AGS1 (225750), Crow et
al. (2006) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
TREX1 gene: a 3-bp insertion (600insGAT), resulting in duplication of an
aspartate residue involved in divalent cation binding within the
catalytic site, and R114H (606609.0001).

.0004
AICARDI-GOUTIERES SYNDROME 1
TREX1, VAL201ASP

In a patient with AGS1 (225750), born of consanguineous Turkish parents,
Crow et al. (2006) identified a homozygous 602T-A transversion in the
TREX1 gene, resulting in a val201-to-asp (V201D) substitution in the
catalytic site of the protein. Patient-derived fibroblasts showed no
detectable TREX1 3-prime exonuclease activity.

.0005
CHILBLAIN LUPUS
TREX1, 1-BP DUP, 375T

In a nonconsanguineous Bangladeshi family, Rice et al. (2007) found
association between chilblain lupus (610448) and a heterozygous mutation
in the TREX1 gene, the duplication of a single base (375dupT) that
resulted in a truncated protein missing the last 188 amino acids. The
mutation was present in 3 affected sibs; it was found also in a fourth
sib with a subclinical phenotype.

.0006
AICARDI-GOUTIERES SYNDROME 1, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
TREX1, ASP200ASN

In a child with a classic history of Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome
(225750), born to nonconsanguineous Scottish parents, Rice et al. (2007)
found heterozygosity for a missense mutation in the TREX1 gene: a 598G-A
transition that resulted in a substitution of asparagine for aspartic
acid at codon 200 (D200N). Both parents had a homozygous wildtype
genotype at this position, suggesting a de novo occurrence.
Differentiation of the maternal and paternal alleles was possible
because of a frequently observed C-to-T SNP at position 531, which
allowed the authors to demonstrate that the mutation has arisen on the
maternal allele. A standard exonuclease assay indicated close-to-normal
TREX1 enzymatic activity. Rice et al. (2007) hypothesized that the
aspartic acid at position 200 of TREX1 represents one of 4 residues
essential for coordinating 2 magnesium ions involved in DNA binding and
catalysis, and that the D200N mutation represents a gain-of-function
mutation conferring altered substrate specificity, DNA binding, or
protein-protein interaction which would not be detected in a standard
TREX1 exonuclease assay.

Fye et al. (2011) stated that asp18 and asp200 are the 2 aspartates that
coordinate the divalent metal ion Mg(2+) at the TREX1 active site and
contribute to DNA binding and catalysis. They found that homodimers of
recombinant human TREX1 containing D200N or D18N (606609.0007) mutations
had negligible nuclease activity against ssDNA and dsDNA compared with
wildtype. Heterodimers of wildtype TREX1 with D18N or D200N TREX1
mutants had more modestly reduced ssDNA nuclease activity, but
profoundly reduced dsDNA nuclease activity, compared with wildtype
homodimers. Fye et al. (2011) concluded that the dominant phenotypes of
asp18 and asp200 mutations relate predominantly to impaired dsDNA
degradation and indicate that TREX1 dsDNA degradation activity is
fundamental to the prevention of autoimmunity.

.0007
CHILBLAIN LUPUS
AICARDI-GOUTIERES SYNDROME 1, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT, INCLUDED
TREX1, ASP18ASN

In affected members of the large 5-generation German family with
chilblain lupus (610448) previously described by Lee-Kirsch et al.
(2006), Lee-Kirsch et al. (2007) identified heterozygosity for a 52G-A
transversion in exon 1 of the TREX1 gene, resulting in an asp18-to-asn
(D18N) substitution at a highly conserved residue critical for catalytic
activity. The mutation was not found in unaffected family members or in
400 control chromosomes. Recombinant mutant TREX1 homodimers were
enzymatically inactive, whereas mutant/wildtype heterodimers had
approximately 40% of the activity of wildtype dimers, indicating that
D18N is a loss-of-function allele that does not exhibit a
dominant-negative effect. Compared to control cells, patient-derived
lymphoblastoid cells were substantially less sensitive to cell death
after treatment with granzyme A (GZMA; 140050) but not granzyme B (GZMB;
123910), indicating that D18N specifically interferes with GZMA-mediated
cell death in the caspase-independent form of apoptosis.

In a 16-year-old girl with relatively mild Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome
(AGS1; 225750), who was negative for mutation in other known AGS genes,
Haaxma et al. (2010) identified a de novo heterozygous D18N missense
mutation in the TREX1 gene. The mutation was not found in either parent
or in 200 control chromosomes. The patient also displayed features of
mitochondrial disease, with cytochrome oxidase-negative and ragged-red
fibers seen on histologic examination of the quadriceps muscle;
biochemical measurements showed decreased overall energy production (ATP
and CrP) in the presence of normal activities of individual respiratory
chain complexes, again compatible with mitochondrial dysfunction.
However, heteroduplex analysis of the entire mitochondrial DNA did not
show any mutations. This patient also had peripheral neuropathy with
prominent axonal loss and disturbances of myelination without strict
demyelination.

Fye et al. (2011) stated that asp18 and asp200 are the 2 aspartates that
coordinate the divalent metal ion Mg(2+) at the TREX1 active site and
contribute to DNA binding and catalysis. They found that homodimers of
recombinant human TREX1 containing D200N (60609.0006) or D18N mutations
had negligible nuclease activity against ssDNA and dsDNA compared with
wildtype. Heterodimers of wildtype TREX1 with D18N or D200N TREX1
mutants had more modestly reduced ssDNA nuclease activity, but
profoundly reduced dsDNA nuclease activity, compared with wildtype
homodimers. Fye et al. (2011) concluded that the dominant phenotypes of
asp18 and asp200 mutations relates predominantly to impaired dsDNA
degradation and indicates that TREX1 dsDNA degradation activity is
fundamental to the prevention of autoimmunity.

VASCULOPATHY, RETINAL, WITH CEREBRAL LEUKODYSTROPHY
TREX1, 1-BP INS, 3688G

In 5 families with autosomal dominant retinal vasculopathy with cerebral
leukodystrophy (192315), including 2 North American families previously
reported by Grand et al. (1988) and 1 Dutch pedigree originally
described by Storimans et al. (1991), Richards et al. (2007) identified
heterozygosity for a 1-bp insertion (3688G) at the C terminus of the
TREX1 gene, resulting in a frameshift at val235 (V235fs). Haplotype
analysis suggested that these families were not related. The mutation
was not found in 192 Caucasian, 192 Chinese, or 300 Dutch control
alleles. In expression studies, the truncated protein retained
exonuclease activity but lost normal perinuclear localization.

.0009
VASCULOPATHY, RETINAL, WITH CEREBRAL LEUKODYSTROPHY
TREX1, 4-BP DUP, 3727GTCA

In a North American family of Chinese ancestry with autosomal dominant
retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukodystrophy (192315), previously
reported by Jen et al. (1997), Richards et al. (2007) identified
heterozygosity for a 4-bp duplication (3727dupGTCA) at the C terminus of
the TREX1 gene, resulting in a frameshift at thr249 (T249fs). The
mutation was not found in 192 Caucasian, 192 Chinese, or 300 Dutch
control alleles. In expression studies, the truncated protein retained
exonuclease activity but lost normal perinuclear localization.

;;INOSINE-5-PRIME-MONOPHOSPHATE DEHYDROGENASE, TYPE II; IMPD2
IMPDH2 ENZYME ACTIVITY, VARIATION IN, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Human type II inosine 5-prime-monophosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.205)
is the rate-limiting enzyme in de novo guanine nucleotide biosynthesis.
Regulated inosine 5-prime-monophosphate dehydrogenase activity is
associated with cellular proliferation, transformation, and
differentiation (Glesne and Huberman, 1994).

See also IMP dehydrogenase-1 (IMPDH1; 146690).

CLONING

Glesne and Huberman (1994) isolated YAC clones containing the IMPDH2
gene and cloned the full-length human cDNA from a human peripheral blood
genomic library. IMPDH2 shares 84% amino acid identity with IMPDH1. They
identified 4 Sp1-binding sites but did not identify a TATA box. The
transcriptional start sites were determined by S1 nuclease mapping to be
somewhat heterogeneous, but the predominant mRNA species showed a
5-prime end at 102 and 85 nucleotides from the translational initiation
codon. Zimmermann et al. (1995) also cloned the IMPDH2 gene and
characterized regulatory elements, including a TATA box and SP1, AP2,
ATF, and CREB transcription factor-binding sites in the 5-prime flanking
region of the gene.

GENE STRUCTURE

Glesne and Huberman (1994) determined that the IMPDH2 gene contains 13
exons and spans approximately 5 kb. Zimmermann et al. (1995) determined
that the IMPDH2 gene contains 14 exons spanning approximately 5.8 kb.
They also characterized regulatory elements in the 5-prime flanking
region of the gene.

MAPPING

Using PCR primers specific for type II IMPDH, Glesne et al. (1993)
screened a panel of human/Chinese hamster cell somatic hybrids and a
separate deletion panel of chromosome 3 hybrids and localized the gene
to chromosome 3p24.2-p21.2.

By FISH, Kost-Alimova et al. (1998) refined the localization of the
IMPDH2 gene to 3p21.2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Wang et al. (2007) identified a missense mutation in the IMPDH2 gene
(146691.0001) that reduces activity of IMPDH2 to 10% of that of
wildtype. The authors suggested that this functional variant may
contribute to interindividual differences in transplant patient response
to treatment with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), the active metabolite of
which targets IMPDH2.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
IMPDH2 ENZYME ACTIVITY, VARIATION IN
IMPDH2, LEU263PHE

Wang et al. (2007) analyzed the IMPDH2 gene in DNA samples from 152
solid organ transplant patients and identified a 787C-T transition in
exon 7 of the IMPDH2 gene, resulting in a leu263-to-phe (L263F)
substitution at a highly conserved residue within the alpha-helix of the
alpha/beta barrel core domain of the protein, which contains the entire
machinery for enzyme catalytic activity. Kinetic assay demonstrated that
the enzyme activity of the L263F variant was reduced 10-fold compared to
wildtype. The authors suggested that this functional variant may
contribute to interindividual differences in transplant patient response
to treatment with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), the active metabolite of
which (mycophenolic acid) targets IMPDH2.

;;EOGT1;;
CHROMOSOME 3 OPEN READING FRAME 64; C3ORF64
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Protein modification by O-linked-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc)
regulates intracellular signaling, endocytosis, transcription, and
protein stability, and can modulate nutrient sensing. EOGT functions as
an O-GlcNAc transferase (EC 2.4.1.255) that modifies threonine residues
within epidermal growth factor (EGF; see 131530)-like repeats (summary
by Sakaidani et al., 2012).

CLONING

By database analysis using Drosophila Eogt as query, Sakaidani et al.
(2012) identified the mouse, human, and nematode orthologs. Mouse Eogt1
encodes a deduced 527-amino acid protein containing an N-terminal signal
peptide and a C-terminal KDEL-like sequence for retention in the
endoplasmic reticulum. Northern blot analysis detected variable
expression of a major 4.6-kb transcript in all mouse tissues examined,
with highest expression in lung and lowest expression in skeletal
muscle. Sakaidani et al. (2012) also identified a minor splice variant
that includes the 94-basepair intron 12, resulting in a premature stop
codon. The truncated protein is predicted to be inactive.

To determine the developmental expression pattern of Eogt, Shaheen et
al. (2013) performed whole-mount in situ hybridization on mouse embryos
and observed expression of Eogt at embryonic day (E) 10.5 in the growing
edge of the limb buds. At E11.5, Eogt mRNA was enriched in the apical
ectodermal ridge of the limbs. By E12.5, the expression of Eogt assumed
a digit-condensation pattern in the 4 limbs.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the EOGT gene to chromosome 3p14.1 based on an
alignment of the EOGT sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK091089) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

Using an in vitro assay, Sakaidani et al. (2012) found that mouse Eogt
utilized uridine diphosphate (UDP)-GlcNAc as a sugar donor to transfer
GlcNAc to a conserved threonine residue within the EGF-like domain of
Notch (see 190198). Enzyme activity was enhanced in the presence of
divalent cations, particularly Mn(2+). In transfected HEK293 cells, the
O-GlcNAc moiety was further modified into an elongated glycan capped by
N-acetyl-lactosamine.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected individuals from 3 consangineous Arab families with
Adams-Oliver syndrome mapping to chromosome 3 (AOS4; 615297), Shaheen et
al. (2013) identified homozygosity for 2 missense mutations and a 1-bp
deletion, respectively (614789.0001-614789.0003). The variants
segregated with disease in the families and were not found in 230 Saudi
exomes, the 1000 Genomes Project, or the NHLBI Exome Variant Server.

ANIMAL MODEL

Sakaidani et al. (2012) found that depletion of Eogt in developing
Drosophila wing discs caused cell adhesion defects and resulted in wing
blistering in the posterior compartment. The phenotype was completely
rescued by expression of mouse Eogt1, indicating conservation of
function.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ADAMS-OLIVER SYNDROME 4
EOGT, TRP207SER

In a 5-week-old Arab girl with Adams-Oliver syndrome (AOS4; 615297),
born of first-cousin parents, Shaheen et al. (2013) identified
homozygosity for a c.620G-C transversion in the EOGT gene, resulting in
a trp207-to-ser (W207S) substitution at a highly conserved residue. Her
unaffected parents were heterozygous carriers of the mutation, which was
not found in 230 Saudi exomes, the 1000 Genomes Project, or the NHLBI
Exome Variant Server. In addition to cutis aplasia of the scalp and
terminal transverse defects of her toes, she had an atrial septal defect
(ASD-II), but she had no microphthalmia and neuroimaging was normal.

.0002
ADAMS-OLIVER SYNDROME 4
EOGT, 1-BP DEL, 1074A

In a 2.67-year-old Arab boy with Adams-Oliver syndrome (AOS4; 615297),
born of consanguineous parents, Shaheen et al. (2013) identified
homozygosity for a 1-bp deletion (c.1074delA) in the EOGT gene, causing
a frameshift that resulted in a premature stop codon (Gly359AspfsTer28).
The mutation was not found in 230 Saudi exomes, the 1000 Genomes
Project, or the NHLBI Exome Variant Server. In addition to cutis aplasia
of the scalp and terminal transverse defects of the toes that were more
pronounced on the right, he had a muscular ventricular septal defect and
patent ductus arteriosus, which had resolved. Additional features
included left temporal and occipital lobe infarcts of presumed prenatal
origin, speech and fine motor delays, and umbilical hernia. Shaheen et
al. (2013) stated that using the alternatively spliced NCBI version of
EOGT (RefSeq NM_173654.1), the mutation would be designated 832-791delA.

.0003
ADAMS-OLIVER SYNDROME 4
EOGT, ARG377GLN

In 3 affected children from a consanguineous Arab kindred with
Adams-Oliver syndrome (AOS4; 615297), Shaheen et al. (2013) identified
homozygosity for a c.1130G-A transition in the EOGT gene, resulting in
an arg377-to-gln (R377Q) substitution at a highly conserved residue. The
unaffected parents were heterozygous for the mutation, which was not
found in 230 Saudi exomes, the 1000 Genomes Project, or the NHLBI Exome
Variant Server. The 3 affected individuals had cutis aplasia of the
scalp and terminal transverse defects of the toes, but no microphthalmia
or cardiac anomalies. The 3-year-old female proband also exhibited cutis
marmorata, 6 cafe-au-lait patches on her chest and abdomen, and a small
umbilical hernia. Shaheen et al. (2013) stated that using the
alternatively spliced NCBI version of EOGT (RefSeq NM_173654.1), the
mutation would be designated c.878G-A, ARG293GLN.

612701	TITLE *612701 RIMS-BINDING PROTEIN 3C; RIMBP3C
;;RIMBP3.3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Mittelstaedt and Schoch (2007) cloned mouse Rimbp3, and by database
analysis, they identified 3 human RIMBP3 genes, RIMBP3 (612699), RIMBP3B
(612700), and RIMBP3C, which share 99% nucleotide identity. Each of the
deduced human RIMBP3 proteins contains 1,639 amino acids and has a
calculated molecular mass of 180 kD. The protein has a central SRC
(190090) homology-3 (SH3) domain, followed by 2 tandem fibronectin
(135600)-like 3 (FN3) domains, and 2 C-terminal SH3 domains.
Mittelstaedt and Schoch (2007) noted that all other members of the RIMBP
family have 3 tandem FN3 domains. The N-terminal region is rich in
arginine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, serine, and proline.
Quantitative real-time PCR of mouse tissues detected ubiquitous Rimbp3
expression, with the highest level in testis. Rimbp3 showed low uniform
expression in all mouse brain regions examined and in embryonic mouse
brain.

GENE STRUCTURE

Mittelstaedt and Schoch (2007) found that each of the 3 RIMBP3 genes
contains a single exon. RIMBP3C spans about 5.5 kb.

MAPPING

Mittelstaedt and Schoch (2007) mapped the 3 RIMBP3 genes to a 1.4-Mb
region of chromosome 22q11.21. They mapped the single mouse Rimbp3 gene
to chromosome 16A3.

603819	TITLE *603819 STEROID RECEPTOR RNA ACTIVATOR 1; SRA1
;;SRA
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screening system, Lanz et al. (1999) isolated a
transcriptional coactivator of steroid nuclear receptors, termed steroid
receptor RNA activator (SRA). Northern blot analysis revealed that the
SRA gene was expressed in all human tissues tested as major transcripts
of approximately 0.7 to 0.85 kb and minor transcripts of approximately
1.3 to 1.5 kb; SRA was expressed at high levels in liver and skeletal
muscle and at a low level in brain.

GENE FUNCTION

Lanz et al. (1999) found that SRA was selective for steroid hormone
receptors and mediated transactivation via their N-terminal activation
function. The authors provided functional and mechanistic evidence that
SRA acts as an RNA transcript; transfected SRA, unlike other steroid
receptor coregulators, functioned in the presence of cycloheximide, and
SRA mutants containing multiple translational stop signals retained
their ability to activate steroid receptor-dependent gene expression.
Biochemical fractionation showed that SRA exists in distinct
ribonucleoprotein complexes, one of which contains steroid receptor
coactivator-1 (602691). Lanz et al. (1999) suggested that SRA may act to
confer functional specificity upon multiprotein complexes recruited by
liganded receptors during transcriptional activation.

By immunoprecipitation analysis, Caretti et al. (2006) found that p68
(DDX5; 180630), p72 (DDX17; 608469), and the noncoding RNA SRA
associated with MYOD (MYOD1; 159970) in MYOD-transfected HeLa cells. In
vitro and in vivo experiments identified p68, p72, and SRA as
coactivators of MYOD, and their knockdown in C2C12 mouse myoblast cells
prevented proper muscle gene expression and cell differentiation.

MAPPING

By sequence comparisons, Lanz et al. (1999) identified partial SRA
sequences isolated as HepG2 3-prime untranslated region (GenBank GENBANK
D16861), EST clones, and chromosome 5 BAC clone 319C17 (GenBank GENBANK
AC005214), providing a preliminary mapping of the SRA gene to chromosome
5.

608877	TITLE *608877 VACUOLAR PROTEIN SORTING 13, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF, D; VPS13D
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to VPS13A (605978),
followed by RT-PCR of lymphoid cell line and brain RNA, Velayos-Baeza et
al. (2004) cloned VPS13D. They identified 2 main splice variants,
variant 1A and variant 2A, based on the presence or absence of exon 40,
respectively, and they identified 4 different 3-prime end splice
variants in the databases. Variant 1A encodes a deduced 4,388-amino acid
protein, and variant 2A encodes a deduced 4,363-amino acid protein.
VPS13D shares significant similarity with yeast Vps13 and other human
VPS13 proteins, mostly in the N and C termini. Northern blot analysis
detected VPS13D expression in all tissues tested. Variant 2A
predominated in all tissues except brain and testis, in which variant 1A
predominated.

GENE STRUCTURE

Velayos-Baeza et al. (2004) determined that the VPS13D gene contains 70
exons and spans 280 kb. The translation start codon is in exon 2.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Velayos-Baeza et al. (2004) mapped the
VPS13D gene to chromosome 1p36. They mapped the mouse Vps13d gene to
chromosome 4E1.

ALPHA-2,3-SIALYLTRANSFERASE II; ST3GALII;;

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ST3GAL3 gene encodes
beta-galactoside-alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase-III, a Golgi resident
membrane protein that forms the sialyl Lewis a (sLe-a) epitope on
glyocoproteins. These glycoproteins form the glycocalyx, composed of
sialic acids that act as key determinants of a variety of cellular
recognition and communication processes (summary by Hu et al., 2011).

CLONING

By screening a human placenta cDNA library with a probe based on the
sialyl motif (a highly conserved region in the catalytic domain of
sialyltransferases), Kitagawa and Paulson (1993) isolated a cDNA
encoding SIAT6, which they termed ST3N (EC 2.4.99.6). The deduced
375-amino acid protein is 97% identical to the rat protein. SDS-PAGE
analysis showed expression of an 80-kD protein having sialyltransferase
activity. Northern blot analysis revealed wide expression of a 2.7-kb
transcript with abundant expression in skeletal muscle and high
expression in fetal tissue but low expression in placenta.

Using Northern blot analysis, Kitagawa and Paulson (1994) evaluated the
differential expression of 5 human sialyltransferase genes in adult and
fetal tissues. A 2.7-kb ST3N transcript was expressed highly in skeletal
muscle and moderately in most other tissues examined. A 3.8-kb
transcript was also expressed in testis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Taniguchi et al. (2003) determined that the 5-prime UTR of the ST3GAL3
gene consists of 2 exons. The 5-prime flanking region of the promoter
lacks canonical TATA or CCAAT boxes, but it contains several putative
transcriptional factor binding sites.

Hu et al. (2011) stated that the ST3GAL3 gene contains 15 exons, 12 of
which are coding exons.

MAPPING

The International RH Mapping Consortium mapped the SIAT6 gene to
chromosome 1 (TMAP stSG22084).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Autosomal Recessive Mental Retardation 12

In affected members of 2 unrelated consanguineous Iranian families with
autosomal recessive nonsyndromic mental retardation-12 (MRT12; 611090),
Hu et al. (2011) used linkage analysis, chromosome sorting, and
next-generation sequencing to identify 2 different homozygous mutations
in the ST3GAL3 gene (A13D, 606494.0001 and D370Y, 606494.0002,
respectively.) Neither mutation affected the highly conserved sialyl
motifs, but rather affected the N-terminal transmembrane domain and
catalytic domain, respectively. In vitro functional expression studies
showed that the mutant proteins were mislocalized to the endoplasmic
reticulum and that one (D370Y) had loss of catalytic activity. The
findings demonstrated a link between the glycoprotein complex,
sialyltransferase activity, and higher cognitive functioning.

- Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy 15

In 4 members of a consanguineous Palestinian family with early infantile
epileptic encephalopathy-15 (EIEE15; 615006), Edvardson et al. (2013)
identified a homozygous mutation in the ST3GAL3 gene (A320P;
606494.0003). The mutation was identified by linkage analysis combined
with whole-exome sequencing of 1 individual and confirmed by Sanger
sequencing. The mutation affected the highly conserved sialyl motif S,
which is crucially involved in binding of both donor and acceptor
substrate. In vitro functional expression studies showed that secretion
of the mutant protein was reduced to 25% of control levels and it had no
detectable enzymatic activity. The phenotype was severe: patients showed
delayed psychomotor development and had onset of refractory infantile
spasms between ages 3 and 7 months associated with hypsarrhythmia on
EEG. Other features included hypotonia, poor eye contact, and inability
to speak or walk, even later in childhood. All were profoundly mentally
retarded. Edvardson et al. (2013) noted that the phenotype was more
severe than that observed by Hu et al. (2011), who had identified
ST3GAL3 mutations outside of the highly conserved and functionally
important sialyl motifs.

In affected members of a consanguineous Iranian family with autosomal

Najmabadi et al. (2007), Hu et al. (2011) identified a homozygous 38C-A
transversion in exon 2 of the ST3GAL3 gene, resulting in an ala13-to-asp
(A13D) substitution in the transmembrane domain. The mutation was not
found in 278 copies of chromosome 1 from ethnically matched controls or
in 385 control individuals. In vitro functional expression studies in
murine fibroblasts showed that most of the mutant protein was improperly
localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, preventing the protein from
interacting with its substrates in the Golgi, resulting in a loss of
function. Catalytic activity of the A13D mutant enzyme was similar to
wildtype.

In affected members of a consanguineous Iranian family with autosomal

identified a homozygous 1108G-T transversion in exon 14 of the ST3GAL3
gene, resulting in an asp370-to-tyr (D370Y) substitution in the
catalytic domain at the C-terminal end of the protein. The mutation was
not found in 278 copies of chromosome 1 from ethnically matched controls
or in 385 control individuals. In vitro functional expression studies in
murine fibroblasts showed that the mutant protein was improperly
localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, preventing the protein from
interacting with its substrates in the Golgi, resulting in a loss of
function. The D370Y mutant protein also showed a complete lack of enzyme
activity. Studies of recombinant proteins in CHO cells indicated that
secretion of the D370Y mutant protein was dramatically reduced compared
to wildtype. Hu et al. (2011) concluded that the mutant protein was
cleared by the endoplasmic reticulum-mediated system, suggesting that
the C terminus is important for the proper folding of functional
ST3GAL3.

linkage analysis combined with whole-exome sequencing of 1 individual
and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. It segregated with the disorder in
the family and was not found in 123 controls of the same ethnic origin
or in 5,379 control exomes. In vitro functional expression studies
showed that secretion of the mutant protein was reduced to 25% of
control levels and that the protein had no detectable enzymatic
activity.

601900	TITLE *601900 INTERFERON REGULATORY FACTOR 4; IRF4
;;LYMPHOCYTE-SPECIFIC IRF; LSIRF;;
MULTIPLE MYELOMA ONCOGENE 1; MUM1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

IRF4 is a transcription factor essential for the development of T
helper-2 (Th2) cells, IL17 (see 603149)-producing Th17 cells, and IL9
(146931)-producing Th9 cells (Staudt et al., 2010).

CLONING

Grossman et al. (1996) cloned a novel human interferon regulatory factor
(IRF) that they named LSIRF for 'lymphocyte-specific IRF.' They reported
that the gene encodes a 450-amino acid polypeptide with a predicted mass
of 51.6 kD. The gene is expressed as a single 5-kb transcript in spleen,
lymphocytes, and melanocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

Grossman et al. (1996) found that expression of LSIRF was induced in T
cells after crosslinking of the T-cell receptor (see 186880).

By fluorescence and confocal microscopy, Negishi et al. (2005)
demonstrated that IRF4 interacted with MYD88 (602170) in the cytoplasm
of human embryonic kidney cells. Mutation and coimmunoprecipitation
analysis showed that IRF4 interacted with the TIR/IL1 region of MYD88.
IRF4 inhibited interaction of MYD88 with IRF5 (607218), which interacts
with the same central region of MYD88 as IRF4, but it did not block
interaction of MYD88 with IRF7 (605047), which binds to the N terminus.
IRF5-dependent gene induction was inhibited by IRF4, and IRF4-deficient
macrophages were hyperresponsive to Toll-like receptor (TLR; see 603030)
stimuli. Negishi et al. (2005) concluded that IRF4 negatively regulates
TLR signaling by selectively competing with IRF5.

Shaffer et al. (2008) used a loss-of-function, RNA interference-based
genetic screen to demonstrate that IRF4 inhibition is toxic to myeloma
cell lines, regardless of transforming oncogenic mechanism. Gene
expression profiling and genomewide chromatin immunoprecipitation
analysis uncovered an extensive network of IRF4 target genes and
identified MYC (190080) as a direct target of IRF4 in activated B cells
and myeloma. Unexpectedly, IRF4 was itself a direct target of MYC
transactivation, generating an autoregulatory circuit in myeloma cells.
Shaffer et al. (2008) suggested that although IRF4 is not genetically
altered in most myelomas, they are nonetheless addicted to an aberrant
IRF4 regulatory network that fuses the gene expression programs of
normal plasma cells and activated B cells.

Zheng et al. (2009) showed that in mouse T regulatory cells, high
amounts of IRF4, a transcription factor essential for TH2 effector cell
differentiation, is dependent on Foxp3 (300292) expression. They
proposed that IRF4 expression endows T regulatory cells with the ability
to suppress TH2 responses. Indeed, ablation of a conditional Irf4 allele
in T regulatory cells resulted in selective dysregulation of TH2
responses, IL4-dependent immunoglobulin isotype production, and tissue
lesions with pronounced plasma cell infiltration, in contrast to the
mononuclear cell-dominated pathology typical of mice lacking T
regulatory cells. Zheng et al. (2009) concluded that T regulatory cells
use components of the transcriptional machinery, promoting a particular
type of effector CD4+ T cell differentiation, to efficiently restrain
the corresponding type of the immune response.

Staudt et al. (2010) found that Cd4 (186940)-positive T cells from Irf4
-/- mice failed to differentiate into Il9-producing Th9 cells in the
presence of Tgfb (190180) and Il4 (147780). Treatment of Cd4-positive T
cells with Irf4 small interfering RNA strongly reduced Il9 production
and enhanced Ifng (147570) expression, but had no effect on Il2 (147680)
production. Reporter gene analysis demonstrated that Irf4 bound directly
to the Il9 promoter. Naive human CD4-positive T cells stimulated with
IL4 and TGFB also differentiated into Th9 cells, and this was
accompanied by strong expression of IRF4. Staudt et al. (2010) concluded
that IRF4 is essential for development of Th9 cells.

By flow cytometric analysis, Cretney et al. (2011) demonstrated that
Blimp1 (PRDM1; 603423) was expressed in a subset of mouse regulatory T
cells (Tregs) that localized mainly to mucosal sites and expressed Il10
(124092) in a Blimp1-dependent manner. Blimp1 was also required for
tissue homeostasis. Irf4, but not Tbet (TBX21; 604895), was essential
for Blimp1 expression and for differentiation of all effector Tregs.
Cretney et al. (2011) concluded that the differentiation pathway that
leads to the acquisition of Treg effector functions requires both IRF4
and BLIMP1.

Li et al. (2012) showed that in mouse CD4+ T cells and B cells IRF4
unexpectedly can cooperate with activator protein-1 (AP1; see 165160)
complexes to bind to AP1-IRF4 composite (5-prime-TGAnTCA/GAAA-3-prime)
motifs that they denoted as AP1-IRF composite elements (AICEs).
Moreover, BATF-JUN family protein complexes cooperate with IRF4 in
binding to AICEs in preactivated CD4+ T cells stimulated with IL21
(605384) and in TH17 differentiated cells. Importantly, BATF (612476)
binding was diminished in Irf4-null T cells and IRF4 binding was
diminished in Batf-null T cells, consistent with functional cooperation
between these factors. Moreover, Li et al. (2012) showed that AP1 and
IRF complexes cooperatively promote transcription of the Il10 gene,
which is expressed in TH17 cells and potently regulated by IL21. Li et
al. (2012) concluded that their findings revealed that IRF4 can signal
via complexes containing ETS or AP1 motifs depending on the cellular
context.

Using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing in T-helper-17 (TH17)
cells, Glasmacher et al. (2012) found that IRF4 targets sequences
enriched for activated protein-1 (AP1; 165160)-IRF composite elements
(AICEs) that are cobound by BATF (612476), an AP1 factor required for
TH17, B, and dendritic cell differentiation. IRF4 and BATF bind
cooperatively to structurally divergent AICEs to promote gene activation
and TH17 differentiation. The AICE motif directs assembly of IRF4 or
IRF8 (601565) with BATF heterodimers and is also used in TH2, B, and
dendritic cells. Glasmacher et al. (2012) concluded that this genomic
regulatory element and cognate factors appear to have evolved to
integrate diverse immunomodulatory signals.

MAPPING

Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, Grossman et al. (1996) mapped
the LSIRF gene to chromosome 6p25-p23.

- Association with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia

In a genomewide association study to identify common variants
influencing the risk of developing chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL;
see 151400), Di Bernardo et al. (2008) found the strongest association
with 2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that mapped to a 97-kb
block of linkage disequilibrium on chromosome 6p25.3 (CLLS4; 612558)
that contains the IRF4 gene. The SNP dbSNP rs872071 maps within the
3-prime untranslated region of IRF4. The overall estimate of effect
associated with dbSNP rs872071 was an odds ratio trend of 1.54 with a
95% confidence interval of 1.41 to 1.69 and a P value of 1.91 x 10(-20).
The genotype at SNP dbSNP rs872071 was sufficient to capture all of the
locus variation. Di Bernardo et al. (2008) considered IRF4 a strong
candidate gene for a CLL susceptibility a priori, being a key regulator
of lymphocyte development and proliferation. In studies using
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphocytes, expression of IRF4
mRNA was significantly associated with genotype in a dose-dependent
fashion (P = 0.042), with lower expression associated with risk alleles.
Di Bernardo et al. (2008) argued that this observation is consistent
with a model in which the causal variant influences risk by arresting
transition of memory B cells through decreased IRF4 expression.

Using a set of SNP markers, Crowther-Swanepoel et al. (2010) generated a
fine-scale map of 6p25.3 and narrowed the signal for association with
CLL to an 18-kb DNA segment within the 3-prime untranslated region (UTR)
of IRF4. Resequencing this segment in European subjects identified 55
common polymorphisms, including 13 highly correlated candidate causal
variants. In a large case-control study, it was shown that all but 4
variants could be excluded with 95% confidence. These 4 SNPs mapped to a
3-kb region of the 3-prime UTR of IRF4, consistent with the causal basis
of the association being differential IRF4 expression.

CYTOGENETICS

In multiple myeloma (254500), chromosomal translocations affecting 14q32
and unidentified partner chromosomes are common, suggesting that they
may cause the activation of novel oncogenes. In multiple myeloma cell
lines, Iida et al. (1997) identified a t(6;14)(p25;q32) translocation in
2 of 11 cell lines. The translocation juxtaposes the immunoglobulin
heavy-chain (IGHG1; 147100) locus to the MUM1 (for 'multiple myeloma
oncogene 1') gene, which is also referred to as interferon regulatory
factor-4 (IRF4), a member of a gene family known to be active in the
control of B-cell proliferation and differentiation. See IRF1 (147575)
on chromosome 5 and IRF2 (147576) on chromosome 4. As a result of the
translocation, the MUM1/IRF4 gene is overexpressed, an event that may
contribute to tumorigenesis, as Iida et al. (1997) showed that MUM1/IRF4
has oncogenic activity in vitro.

ANIMAL MODEL

By knocking out exons 2 and 3 of the Irf4 gene, Mittrucker et al. (1997)
generated mice deficient in Irf4 protein. Flow cytometric analysis
indicated normal expression of bone marrow and immature B-lymphocyte
markers. After 4 to 5 weeks of age, the mutant mice began to develop
generalized lymphadenopathy with expansion of both T and B lymphocytes,
failed to develop germinal centers in B-cell follicles or plasma cells
after immunization, had poor T- and B-lymphocyte proliferative responses
after stimulation with most mitogens, lacked production of all serum Ig
subclasses after immunization with T cell-dependent or -independent
antigens, and were unable to reject mastocytoma cells. Mittrucker et al.
(1997) concluded that IRF4 is essential for mature T- and B-lymphocyte
function.

Negishi et al. (2005) found that mice lacking Irf4 displayed a more
potent and lethal inflammatory response to CpG oligonucleotides,
underscoring the role of IRF4 as a critical negative regulator of TLR
signaling.

Honma et al. (2005) showed that Irf4 -/- mice were sensitive to TLR
stimulation, such as lipopolysaccharide-induced shock. Irf4 -/-
macrophages produced high levels of Tnf (191160) and Il6 (147620) in
response to TLR ligands. Small interfering RNA against Irf4 in normal
macrophages inhibited the inflammatory response. Honma et al. (2005)
concluded that IRF4 negatively regulates TLR signaling and inhibits
proinflammatory cytokine production.

Staudt et al. (2010) found that transfer of either Th2 or Th9 cells to
Rag2 (179616)-deficient mice resulted in severe asthma symptoms. In mice
that had received Th9 cells, but not Th2 cells, these symptoms could be
relieved with anti-Il9. Mice lacking Irf4, which is essential for Th9
cell development, were resistant to development of asthma, while Irf4
+/- heterozygotes had an intermediate phenotype. Staudt et al. (2010)
concluded that Th9 cell-derived IL9 is an important inducer of asthmatic
symptoms, equivalent to that caused by Th2 cells and IL4.

;;CELL DIVISION CYCLE 2-LIKE 5; CDC2L5;;
CELL DIVISION CONTROLLER, CHOLINESTERASE-RELATED; CHED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Lapidot-Lifson et al. (1992) cloned a glioblastoma cDNA encoding a
protein related to the S. pombe cdc2 kinase. They designated the
predicted 418-amino acid protein CHED, for cholinesterase-related cell
division controller. The CHED protein shares 34 to 42% sequence identity
with human CDC2 (116940), S. cerevisiae Cdc28, and S. pombe Cdc2, 3
functionally interchangeable proteins. Northern blot analysis revealed
that CHED is expressed as 2.2- to 2.3-kb mRNAs in several fetal tissues
and tumor cell lines.

GENE FUNCTION

Using an antisense oligonucleotide, Lapidot-Lifson et al. (1992) found
that reduced CHED expression selectively inhibited megakaryocyte
development in murine bone marrow cultures but did not prevent other
hematopoietic pathways. Antisense mRNA inhibition of BCHE (177400)
expression had a similar effect. The authors suggested that CHED and
BCHE are interrelated components responsive to cholinergic signals in
the hematopoietic pathway. They stated that a link between cholinergic
signaling and cell division might be mediated through individual CDC
proteins in a cell lineage-specific manner.

MAPPING

Gross (2012) mapped the CDK13 gene to chromosome 7p14.1 based on an
alignment of the CDK13 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AJ297709) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

609294	TITLE *609294 SEMAPHORIN 6C; SEMA6C
;;KIAA1869
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2001) cloned SEMA6C, which they designated
KIAA1869. The deduced protein contains 755 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected high expression in skeletal muscle and relatively low
expression in whole adult brain and pancreas. Expression was
intermediate in fetal brain and in all other tissues and specific adult
brain regions examined.

By searching a fetal liver cDNA library for sequences similar to rat
Sema6c, followed by PCR and 5-prime RACE of a human brain cDNA library,
Qu et al. (2002) cloned 3 SEMA6C splice variants. The longest deduced
protein, designated SEMA6C.1, has 962 amino acids and a calculated
molecular mass of 104.3 kD. SEMA6C.1 contains an N-terminal signal
sequence, followed by a SEMA domain, a PSI domain, a transmembrane
segment, and a proline-rich C terminus. SEMA6C.1 also has 3 potential
N-glycosylation sites. SEMA6C.2 contains 930 amino acids and has a
deletion between the extracellular PSI domain and the transmembrane
domain. SEMA6C.3 contains 922 amino acids and has an incomplete SEMA
domain. Northern blot analysis detected a major transcript of 4.0 kb and
a second transcript of 6.0 kb. Expression was high in skeletal muscle,
moderate in heart, brain, and kidney, low in liver and placenta, and
barely detectable in other tissues examined. In situ hybridization of
mouse embryos detected Sema6c expression beginning at embryonic day 13,
with widespread expression in brain and spinal cord. Labeling of
cultured rat spinal cord neurons showed expression in neural perikaryon,
processes, and termini, but no labeling of nuclei or axons. Transient
transfection of SEMA6C.1 in COS-7 cells resulted in expression of a
cytoplasmic protein of about 62.5 kD and a secreted protein of about 75
kD, suggesting modification after secretion. SEMA6C.1 was also expressed
on the cell surface. Both SEMA6C.3 and a SEMA6C.1 mutant lacking the PSI
domain were expressed in a punctate cytoplasmic distribution, with
accumulation at the 2 ends of many cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Qu et al. (2002) exposed chicken embryo dorsal root ganglion explants
and neonatal rat cortical and hippocampal neurons to SEMA6C secreted
from transfected COS-7 cells and found that SEMA6C induced growth cone
collapse. SEMA6C also inhibited axonal extension in a nerve growth
factor (NGF; see 162030)-differentiated rat pheochromocytoma cell line.

GENE STRUCTURE

Qu et al. (2002) determined that the SEMA6C contains at least 20 exons
and spans about 15 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2001) mapped the SEMA6C
gene to chromosome 10. However, Qu et al. (2002) mapped the SEMA6C gene
to chromosome 1q12-q21.1 by genomic sequence analysis. The International
Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SEMA6C gene to chromosome
1 (TMAP RH47819).

Qu et al. (2002) mapped the mouse Sema6c gene to chromosome 16.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Microtubule-associated proteins MAP1A (600178) and MAP1B (157129)
constitute nearly half of the mass of all the microtubule associated
proteins that copurify with brain microtubules. MAP1A and MAP1B are each
composed of a heavy chain and multiple light-chain subunits. Two of
these light-chain subunits, LC1 and LC2, are encoded within the 3-prime
end of the same open reading frames that encode the MAP1B and MAP1A
heavy chains, respectively (Hammarback et al., 1991; Langkopf et al.,
1992). Mann and Hammarback (1996) examined the expression of another
light chain, LC3, which is a component of both MAP1A and MAP1B
microtubule-binding complexes. They found that, although LC3 was
expressed exclusively in cells expressing heavy chains, developmental
changes in the total amount of LC3 protein were not proportional to the
amounts of either heavy chain MAP1A or MAP1B. Using LC3-specific
oligonucleotides, Mann and Hammarback (1996) amplified a 300-bp LC3
fragment from a human retina cDNA library.

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to rat Map1lc3,
followed by PCR of a heart cDNA library, He et al. (2003) cloned
MAP1LC3A. The deduced 121-amino acid protein shares 81% identity with
rat Map1lc3. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.1-kb transcript in most
tissues examined, with highest expression in heart, brain, liver,
skeletal muscle, and testis. No MAP1LC3A expression was detected in
thymus and peripheral blood leukocytes. Western blot analysis of
transfected human embryonic kidney cells detected MAP1LC3A proteins of
about 18 and 15 kD. Following fractionation of transfected HeLa cells,
the 15-kD form associated with the membrane pellet and the 18-kD form
associated with both the membrane and cytosolic fractions.

GENE FUNCTION

Rat Lc3 is processed into cytosolic and membrane-bound forms termed Lc3
I and Lc3 II, respectively. Kabeya et al. (2000) found that the
autophagic vacuole fraction prepared from starved rat liver was enriched
with Lc3 II. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed specific labeling of
autophagosome membrane in addition to cytoplasmic labeling. Lc3 II was
present both inside and outside autophagosomes. Mutation analysis
indicated that Lc3 I was formed by removal of the C-terminal 22 amino
acids from newly synthesized Lc3, leaving a C-terminal glyc120 residue.
A fraction of Lc3 I was then converted into Lc3 II. The amount of Lc3 II
produced correlated with the extent of autophagosome formation.

He et al. (2003) found that MAP1LC3A underwent C-terminal cleavage,
resulting in a protein with the conserved gly120 as its terminal
residue. Gly120 was required for posttranslational modification of
MAP1LC3A.

Behrends et al. (2010) reported a proteomic analysis of the autophagy
interaction network (AIN) in human cells under conditions of ongoing
(basal) autophagy, revealing a network of 751 interactions among 409
candidate interacting proteins with extensive connectivity among
subnetworks. Many new AIN components have roles in vesicle trafficking,
protein or lipid phosphorylation, and protein ubiquitination, and affect
autophagosome number or flux when depleted by RNA interference. The 6
human orthologs of yeast autophagy-8 (ATG8), MAP1LC3A, MAP1LC3B
(609604), MAP1LC3C (609605), GABARAP (605125), GABARAPL1 (607420), and
GABARAPL2 (607452), interact with a cohort of 67 proteins, with
extensive binding partner overlap between family members, and frequent
involvement of a conserved surface on ATG8 proteins known to interact
with LC3-interacting regions in partner proteins. Behrends et al. (2010)
concluded that their studies provided a global view of the mammalian
autophagy interaction landscape and a resource for mechanistic analysis
of this critical protein homeostasis pathway.

Choy et al. (2012) found that the intracellular pathogen Legionella
pneumophila could interfere with autophagy by using the bacterial
effector protein RavZ to directly uncouple Atg8 proteins attached to
phosphatidylethanolamine on autophagosome membranes. RavZ hydrolyzed the
amide bond between the carboxyl-terminal glycine residue and an adjacent
aromatic residue in Atg8 proteins, producing an Atg8 protein that could
not be reconjugated by Atg7 (see 608760) and Atg3 (see 609606). Thus,
Choy et al. (2012) concluded that intracellular pathogens can inhibit
autophagy by irreversibly inactivating Atg8 proteins during infection.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Microtubule-associated protein light chain-3, a mammalian homolog of
yeast Atg8, plays an essential role in autophagy, which is involved in
the bulk degradation of cytoplasmic components by the lysosomal system.
Sugawara et al. (2004) described the crystal structure of LC3 at
2.05-angstrom resolution; it has a ubiquitin fold at the C-terminal
region and 2 helices at the N-terminal region.

MAPPING

Mann and Hammarback (1996) mapped the LC3 gene to chromosome 20cen-q13
using a human/rodent hybrid cell mapping panel.

610207	TITLE *610207 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 4 (ANION EXCHANGER), MEMBER 9; SLC4A9
;;ANION EXCHANGE PROTEIN 4; AE4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By genomic sequence analysis, database analysis, and PCR of kidney and
fetal brain cDNA libraries, Lipovich et al. (2001) cloned SLC4A9. They
identified 14 different SLC4A9 splice variants, with most variation
involving the inclusion or exclusion of portions of exons 8, 10, 11, 19,
and 20. The major splice variant encodes a 990-amino acid protein that
shares 49% and 48% identity with SLC4A4 (603345) and SLC4A7 (603353),
respectively. It contains 12 transmembrane domains, intracellular N and
C termini, and several serine and threonine phosphorylation sites.
Northern blot analysis detected transcripts of 4.3 and 6.0 kb in kidney
only.

By searching databases for homologs of bicarbonate transporters,
followed by PCR of a kidney cDNA library, Parker et al. (2001) cloned
SLC4A9, which they called AE4. The predicted protein contains 945 amino
acids and has a calculated molecular mass of 104 kD. AE4 has 14
transmembrane domains and intracellular N and C termini. It contains an
N-terminal leucine zipper motif, multiple intracellular phosphorylation
sites, and 2 extracellular N-glycosylation sites. It shares 84% amino
acid identity with rabbit Ae4, a sodium-independent Cl-/HCO3- exchanger
located on the apical membrane of beta-intercalated kidney cells.
SDS-PAGE following cell-free translation revealed AE4 at an apparent
molecular mass of 100 kD. AE4 did not appear to be N-glycosylated.
Northern blot analysis detected expression in kidney only.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lipovich et al. (2001) determined that the SLC4A9 gene contains 23
exons. Parker et al. (2001) identified 22 exons in the SLC4A9 gene. A
CCAAT box, a GC box, and a TATA box are located upstream of the
transcriptional start site.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Lipovich et al. (2001) mapped the SLC4A9
gene to chromosome 5q31, between the HEGFL (HBEGF; 126150) and FGF1
(131220) genes.

118661	TITLE *118661 VERSICAN; VCAN
;;CHONDROITIN SULFATE PROTEOGLYCAN 2; CSPG2;;
CHONDROITIN SULFATE PROTEOGLYCAN CORE PROTEIN, CARTILAGE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans were first identified in hyaline
cartilage, where they specifically interact with hyaluronan and form
large supramolecular complexes. Together with other matrix
glycoproteins, they provide mechanical support and a fixed negative
charge. Such molecules exist also in a variety of soft tissues where
they may play additional physiologic roles (Kjellen and Lindahl, 1991).

CLONING

Zimmermann and Ruoslahti (1989) cloned and sequenced the cDNA of the
core protein of fibroblast chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. They
designated it versican in recognition of its versatile modular
structure. Decorin (125255) and biglycan (301870) are 2 other soft
tissue proteoglycans.

Naso et al. (1995) reported that the mouse versican protein is 89%
identical to human versican and is highly expressed in mouse embryos at
days 13, 14, and 18.

Dours-Zimmermann and Zimmermann (1994) provided evidence for the
existence of 3 versican splice variants, designated V0, V1, and V2,
which differ in the length of their glycosaminoglycan attachment portion
inserted between the globular modules at the N- and C-terminal ends of
the core proteins. Versican V1 and V2 include either the GAG-alpha or
the GAG-beta domain providing attachment sites for about 5 to 8 or 12 to
15 glycosaminoglycan chains, respectively. In the V0 variant, both
GAG-alpha and GAG-beta are present. Zako et al. (1995) demonstrated the
existence of another splice variant, designated V3, which lacks a
chondroitin sulfate attachment region, the most distinctive portion of a
proteoglycan molecule.

Bode-Lesniewska et al. (1996) studied the distribution of versican by
using affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies that recognize the core
protein of the prominent versican splice variants V0 and V1. Versican
was present in the loose connective tissues of various organs and was
often associated with the elastic fiber network. It was localized in
most smooth muscle tissues and in fibrous and elastic cartilage.
Versican staining was noted in the central and peripheral nervous
system, in the basal layer of the epidermis, and on the luminal surface
of some glandular epithelia. In blood vessels, versican was present in
all 3 wall layers of veins and elastic arteries. In muscular arteries
the immunoreactivity was normally restricted to the tunica adventitia.
However, it appeared in the media and the split elastica interna of
atherosclerotically transformed vessel walls.

GENE STRUCTURE

Naso et al. (1994) showed that the human versican gene contains 15 exons
spanning more than 90 kb. One of these, exon 7, is used in an
alternative splice variant. The authors sequenced the 5-prime
promoter-containing region of the gene and found that it contained
numerous binding sites for transactivators such as AP2 (107580) and Sp1
(189906). They used transient transfection studies to show that the
promoter functioned well in both mesenchymal and epithelial cells. The
authors used deletion studies to show that this 5-prime region (to
approximately -630) contains both strong enhancer and strong negative
regulatory elements.

MAPPING

The distinctness of CSPG1 (AGC1; 155760) and CSPG2 was uncertain until
both genes had been mapped. Whereas CSPG1 is located on chromosome 15,
Iozzo et al. (1992) demonstrated that the CSPG2 gene is located on
chromosome 5. They used a combination of human/rodent somatic cell
hybrids including a panel of hybrids containing partial deletions of
chromosome 5 and narrowed the assignment to 5q12-q14, with the precise
site likely to be 5q13.2, by in situ hybridization.

Using interspecific backcross analysis, Naso et al. (1995) assigned the
Cspg2 gene to mouse chromosome 13 in a region that is syntenic with 5q.

GENE FUNCTION

To determine whether TP53 (191170) gene dosage affects transcriptional
regulation of target genes, Yoon et al. (2002) performed oligonucleotide
array gene expression analysis by using human cells with wildtype p53 or
with 1 or both TP53 alleles disrupted by homologous recombination. They
identified 35 genes, including CSPG2, whose expression was significantly
correlated to the dosage of TP53. Motif search analysis revealed that
CSPG2 contains a p53 consensus binding site in its first intron. In
vitro and in vivo assays demonstrated that CSPG2 is directly
transactivated by p53.

To understand how cancer cells infect the inflammatory microenvironment,
Kim et al. (2009) conducted a biochemical screen for
macrophage-activating factors secreted by metastatic carcinomas. They
demonstrated that, among the cell lines screened, Lewis lung carcinoma
(LLC) were the most potent macrophage activators leading to production
of interleukin-6 (IL6; 147620) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha
(TNF-alpha; 119160) through activation of the Toll-like receptor family
members TLR2 (603028) and TLR6 (605403). Both TNF-alpha and TLR2 were
found to be required for LLC metastasis. Biochemical purification of
LLC-conditioned medium led to identification of the extracellular matrix
proteoglycan versican, which is upregulated in many human tumors
including lung cancer, as a macrophage activator that acts through TLR2
and its coreceptors TLR6 and CD14 (158120). By activating TLR2:TLR6
complexes and inducing TNF-alpha secretion by myeloid cells, versican
strongly enhances LLC metastatic growth. Kim et al. (2009) concluded
that their results explained how advanced cancer cells usurp components
of the host innate immune system, including bone marrow-derived myeloid
progenitors, to generate an inflammatory microenvironment hospitable for
metastatic growth.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Wagner vitreoretinopathy (WGVRP; 143200) is an autosomal dominant
vitreoretinopathy. Miyamoto et al. (2005) demonstrated a heterozygous
A-to-G transversion at the second base of the 3-prime acceptor splice
site of intron 7 of the CSPG2 gene that cosegregated with the disease in
a Japanese family (118661.0001).

In the large 5-generation Swiss family with vitreoretinopathy originally
described by Wagner (1938), Kloeckener-Gruissem et al. (2006) identified
a heterozygous splice site mutation in intron 8 of the VCAN gene
(118661.0002) that segregated fully with disease.

In affected members of 7 Dutch families with vitreoretinopathy,
Mukhopadhyay et al. (2006) identified heterozygosity for 3 splice site
mutations in intron 7 of the VCAN gene (118661.0003-118661.0005).
Quantitative PCR using RNA from patient blood samples revealed a highly
significant (p less than 0.0001) and consistent increase in the V2 and
V3 splice variants (more than 38-fold and more than 12-fold,
respectively) in all patients with intron 7 nucleotide changes, as well
as in a Chinese family with vitreoretinopathy in which a causal variant
was not identified. Mukhopadhyay et al. (2006) suggested that Wagner
vitreoretinopathy is caused by an imbalance of versican isoforms,
mediated by intronic variants.

In a 4-generation French family with a severe vitreoretinal disorder
mapping to 5q13-q14, Brezin et al. (2011) identified a heterozygous
splice site mutation in intron 7 of the VCAN gene (118661.0006) that
segregated with disease and was not found 100 French controls.

In a British family and a French family with Wagner vitreoretinopathy,
Kloeckener-Gruissem et al. (2013) sequenced the VCAN gene and identified
2 heterozygous splice site mutations, in intron 8 and intron 7 of the
VCAN gene, respectively, that segregated with disease in each family
(118661.0007 and 118661.0008). The levels of splice variants V2 and V3
were significantly increased in all patient fibroblast and blood samples
from these families as well as samples from the Swiss family with
vitreoretinopathy originally described by Wagner (1938), although the
magnitude of the increase varied between tissues and mutations. There
were no statistically significant differences in V0 and V1 levels in
fibroblasts or blood between patients and controls.

In a Japanese family with Wagner syndrome (143200) in which members of 4
generations, to a total of 13 with 11 living at the time of study, were
affected, Miyamoto et al. (2005) described a heterozygous splice
acceptor site mutation in the CSPG2 gene: 4004-2 A-G. Results of RT-PCR
analysis indicated that the mutation activated a cryptic splice site
located 39 bp downstream from the authentic 3-prime splice acceptor
site.

WAGNER VITREORETINOPATHY
VCAN, IVS8DS, G-A, +1

In a large 5-generation Swiss family with vitreoretinopathy (143200),
originally described by Wagner (1938), Kloeckener-Gruissem et al. (2006)
identified a heterozygous transition (9265+1G-A) at the highly conserved
splice donor sequence in intron 8 of the VCAN gene, which segregated
with the phenotype in 21 affected and 26 unaffected family members and
was not found in 104 control alleles. RT-PCR analysis using patient RNA
from venous blood revealed 2 aberrant CSPG2 transcripts, 1 lacking the
entire exon 8 and the other missing only the last 21 bp of exon 8.

Kloeckener-Gruissem et al. (2013) analyzed fibroblasts from a member of
the Swiss family with vitreoretinopathy originally described by Wagner
(1938) and found a 700-fold and a 150-fold increase in versican isoforms
V2 and V3, respectively, compared to controls. In patient blood samples,
amounts of V2 and V3 were increased 48-fold and 32-fold, respectively.

.0003
WAGNER VITREORETINOPATHY
VCAN, IVS7AS, T-C, -5

In all affected individuals from 5 Dutch families with vitreoretinopathy
(143200), including 4 families diagnosed with Wagner syndrome and 1 with
erosive vitreoretinopathy, Mukhopadhyay et al. (2006) identified
heterozygosity for a transition in intron 7 (4004-5T-C) of the VCAN
gene. The mutation was not found in unaffected individuals from any of
the 5 families, or in 250 Dutch controls. The 5 families shared a common
haplotype on chromosome 5q14, suggesting a founder mutation.
Quantitative PCR using RNA from patient blood samples revealed a highly
significant (p less than 0.0001) and consistent increase in the V2 and
V3 splice variants (more than 38-fold and more than 12-fold,
respectively) compared to controls.

WAGNER VITREORETINOPATHY
VCAN, IVS7AS, T-A, -5

In affected members of a Dutch family with Wagner vitreoretinopathy
(143200), Mukhopadhyay et al. (2006) identified heterozygosity for a
transition in intron 7 (4004-5T-A) of the VCAN gene. The mutation was
not found in unaffected members of the family, or in 250 Dutch controls.
RT-PCR analysis of mutant versican transcripts showed activation of a
cryptic splice site resulting in a 39-nucleotide in-frame deletion of
exon 8 in splice variant V0. Quantitative PCR using RNA from patient
blood samples revealed a highly significant (p less than 0.0001) and
consistent increase in the V2 and V3 splice variants (more than 45-fold
and more than 13-fold, respectively) compared to controls.

.0005
WAGNER VITREORETINOPATHY
VCAN, IVS7AS, G-A, -1

In affected members of a Dutch family with Wagner vitreoretinopathy
(143200), Mukhopadhyay et al. (2006) identified heterozygosity for a
transition in intron 7 (4004-1G-A) of the VCAN gene. The mutation was
not found in unaffected members of the family, or in 250 Dutch controls.
RT-PCR analysis of mutant versican transcripts showed activation of a
cryptic splice site resulting in a 39-nucleotide in-frame deletion of
exon 8 in splice variant V0. Quantitative PCR using RNA from patient
blood samples revealed a highly significant (p less than 0.0001) and
consistent increase in the V2 and V3 splice variants (more than 137-fold
and more than 22-fold, respectively) compared to controls.

.0006
WAGNER VITREORETINOPATHY
VCAN, IVS7AS, A-T, -2

In 10 affected members of a 4-generation French family with severe
vitreoretinopathy (1432300), Brezin et al. (2011) identified
heterozygosity for a transversion within the highly conserved acceptor
splice site of intron 7 (4004-2A-T) of the VCAN gene. The mutation was
not found in 6 unaffected family members or in 100 French controls.
Patients in this kindred had a highly variable phenotype, including
exudative vascular abnormalities, and exhibited severe visual
impairment. RT-PCR analysis of patient lymphoblastoid cell RNA indicated
that the mutation activates a cryptic acceptor splice site within exon
8, located 39 bp downstream from the authentic 3-prime splice acceptor
site. Direct sequencing of a shortened RNA fragment showed loss of the
first 39 bp of exon 8, predicted to cause in-frame deletion of 13 amino
acid residues from the beginning of the GAG-beta domain of mature
versican. RT-PCR also indicated aberrant expression of a versican mRNA
lacking the entire exon 8.

.0007
WAGNER VITREORETINOPATHY
VCAN, IVS7, T-A, +2

In 3 affected members of a 4-generation British family with Wagner
vitreoretinopathy (143200), previously studied by Fryer et al. (1990),
Kloeckener-Gruissem et al. (2013) identified heterozygosity for a
transition within the conserved splice donor site of intron 8
(9265+2T-A) of the VCAN gene. The mutation was not found in 300 control
alleles. In patient blood samples, there was a 230-fold and a 143-fold
increase in versican isoforms V2 and V3, respectively, compared to
controls.

.0008
WAGNER VITREORETINOPATHY
VCAN, IVS7, G-C, -1

In 19 affected members of a 4-generation French family with Wagner
vitreoretinopathy (143200), originally reported by Zech et al. (1999),
Kloeckener-Gruissem et al. (2013) identified heterozygosity for a
transversion within the conserved splice acceptor site of intron 7
(4004-1G-C) of the VCAN gene. The mutation was not found in 19
unaffected family members or in 300 control alleles. In patient
fibroblasts, there was an 80-fold and a 150-fold increase in versican
isoforms V2 and V3, respectively, compared to controls, whereas in
patient blood samples, amounts of V2 and V3 increased 64-fold and
6-fold, respectively.
