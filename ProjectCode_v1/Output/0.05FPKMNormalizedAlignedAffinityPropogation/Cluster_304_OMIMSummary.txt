DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Ishikawa et al. (1998) cloned MECT1, which they designated
KIAA0616. The MECT1 mRNA contains a repetitive element in the 3-prime
UTR. Following in vitro translation, the deduced 634-amino acid protein
had an apparent molecular mass of 75 kD by SDS-PAGE. RT-PCR detected
highest expression in brain and kidney, intermediate expression in
heart, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, pancreas, testis, and ovary, and
little to no expression in spleen.

By searching for genes that could activate the IL8 (146930) promoter,
Iourgenko et al. (2003) cloned TORC1. The deduced 650-amino acid protein
contains an N-terminal coiled-coil domain and a protein kinase A (see
176911) phosphorylation site. TORC1 shares 32% amino acid identity with
TORC2 (608972) and TORC3 (608986).

GENE STRUCTURE

Tonon et al. (2003) determined that the CRTC1 gene contains 18 exons.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1998) mapped the CRTC1
gene to chromosome 19. By sequence analysis, Tonon et al. (2003) mapped
the CRTC1 gene to chromosome 19p13.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a reporter gene assay driven by the IL8 promoter in transfected
HeLa cells, Iourgenko et al. (2003) determined that TORC1 is a strong
IL8 activator. Mutation of the CRE-like site in the IL8 promoter
dramatically decreased induction. TORC1 activated expression through a
variant CRE site and through consensus CRE sites. TORC1 potently induced
CREB1 (123810) target genes, bound CREB1, and activated expression
through a potent transcription activation domain.

Wu et al. (2006) screened a human cDNA expression library for genes that
could activate the mouse Pgc1-alpha (PPARGC1A; 604517) promoter
following expression in HeLa cells and identified TORC1, TORC2, and
TORC3 as potent Pgc1-alpha activators. Forced expression of these TORCs
in mouse primary muscle cells induced endogenous Pgc1-alpha and its
target genes, resulting in increased mitochondrial oxidative capacity.

Kovacs et al. (2007) found that Torc1 was expressed in adult mouse brain
and cultured neurons, and that it translocated to the nucleus upon
concomitant activation of calcium and cAMP signaling pathways. Nuclear
translocation of Torc1 resulted in synergistic activation of
Creb-mediated transcription, and Torc1 played a role in activation of
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; 113505) by calcium and cAMP.
Torc1 was involved in late-phase long-term potentiation maintenance at
the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses in the hippocampus. Kovacs et al.
(2007) concluded that TORC1 plays a role in synaptic plasticity and
long-term memory.

Mair et al. (2011) showed that both AMPK (see 602739) and calcineurin
(see 114105) modulate longevity exclusively through posttranslational
modification of CRTC1, the sole C. elegans CRTC. Mair et al. (2011)
demonstrated that CRTC1 is a direct AMPK target, and interacts with the
CREB homolog-1 (CRH1) transcription factor in vivo. The prolongevity
effects of activating AMPK or deactivating calcineurin decrease CRTC1
and CRH1 activity and induce transcriptional responses similar to those
of CRH1-null worms. Downregulation of CRTC1 increases life span in a
CRH1-dependent manner, and directly reducing CRH1 expression increases
longevity, substantiating a role for CRTCs and CREB in aging. Mair et
al. (2011) concluded that their findings indicated a novel role for
CRTCs and CREB in determining life span downstream of AMPK and
calcineurin, and illustrated the molecular mechanisms by which an
evolutionarily conserved pathway responds to low energy to increase
longevity.

CYTOGENETICS

- MECT1/MAML2 Fusion Gene

Truncation of Notch1 (190198) causes a subtype of acute leukemia
(Ellisen et al., 1991), and activation of Notch4 (164951) is associated
with mammary and salivary gland carcinomas of mice (Jhappan et al.,
1992). Tonon et al. (2003) identified a mechanism for disrupting Notch
signaling in human tumorigenesis, characterized by altered function of a
novel human ortholog of the Drosophila Notch coactivation molecule
Mastermind. Tonon et al. (2003) cloned the t(11;19) translocation that
underlies the most common type of human malignant salivary gland tumor.
This rearrangement fuses exon 1 from the MECT1 gene at 19p13 with exons
2 to 5 of the MAML2 gene (6075357), a novel member of the
Mastermind-like gene family, at 11q21 (Wu et al., 2002). Similar to
Drosophila Mastermind and MAML1 (605424), full-length MAML2 functions as
a CSL-dependent transcriptional coactivator for ligand-stimulated Notch.
In contrast, Tonon et al. (2003) found that the MECT1-MAML2 fusion
protein activated transcription of the Notch target gene HES1 (139605)
independently of both Notch ligand and CSL binding sites. MECT1-MAML2
induced loci formation in RK3E epithelial cells, confirming a biologic
effect for the fusion product. The data suggested a novel mechanism to
disrupt the function of a Notch coactivator in a common type of
malignant salivary gland tumor.

Conkright et al. (2003) determined that the MECT1-MAML2 fusion protein,
which they called TORC1-MAML2, bound CREB following transfection in
HEK293 cells. Cotransfection of the TORC1-MAML2 expression vector
strongly induced CRE reporter activity, but MAML2 alone, which lacks a
CREB-binding domain, had no effect.

Using expression arrays, Wu et al. (2005) found that MECT1/MAML2 induced
expression of multiple genes involved in cAMP signaling in epithelial
cells. The transforming activity of MECT1/MAML2 required both the
CREB-binding domain from MECT1 and the TAD domain from MAML2.
MECT1/MAML2 recruited p300 (EP300; 602700)/CBP (CREBBP; 600140) to the
CRE transcriptional complex, and this recruitment activity was partially
responsible for activation of the CREB pathway and transforming
activity. Disruption of CREB activity reduced the ability of MECT1/MAML2
to transform RK3E rat kidney epithelial cells and suppressed growth in 2
human MECT1/MAML2-positive MEC cell lines.

ANIMAL MODEL

Altarejos et al. (2008) demonstrated that CRTC1 is required for energy
balance and reproduction. Crtc1-null mice are hyperphagic, obese, and
infertile. Hypothalamic Crtc1 was phosphorylated and inactive in leptin
(164160)-deficient ob/ob mice, while leptin administration increased
amounts of dephosphorylated nuclear Crtc1. Dephosphorylated Crtc1
stimulated expression of the Cartpt (602606) and Kiss1 (603286) genes,
which encode hypothalamic neuropeptides that mediate leptin's effects on
satiety and fertility. Crtc1 overexpression in hypothalamic cells
increased Cartpt and Kiss1 gene expression, whereas Crtc1 depletion
decreased it. Indeed, leptin enhanced Crtc1 activity over the Cartpt and
Kiss1 promoters in cells overexpressing leptin receptor (601007), and
these effects were disrupted by expression of a dominant-negative Creb1
polypeptide. As leptin administration increased recruitment of
hypothalamic Crtc1 to Cartpt and Kiss1 promoters, Altarejos et al.
(2008) concluded that the Creb1 (123810)-Crtc1 pathway mediates the
central effects of hormones and nutrients on energy balance and
fertility.

602055	TITLE *602055 INSULIN-INDUCED GENE 1; INSIG1
;;CL6, RAT, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By subtractive hybridization and differential screening following
induction by insulin, Diamond et al. (1993) identified a 'delayed-early
gene,' designated CL-6, from the rat H35 cell line. The deduced
256-amino acid rat protein is highly hydrophobic. CL-6 is the most
highly insulin-induced gene in H35 cells. Northern blot analysis showed
that CL-6 is expressed in normal liver and kidney as well as in
regenerating liver. Peng et al. (1997) isolated a human gene that they
designated insulin-induced gene-1 (INSIG1). They found it to share 80%
identity with the rat CL-6 gene within the translated region.

By PCR of a HepG2 cell cDNA library, Yang et al. (2002) obtained a cDNA
encoding INSIG1. The deduced 277-amino acid protein has at least 6
membrane spanning regions and differs from the sequence reported by Peng
et al. (1997) at residues 27 (ala vs thr), 31 (ala vs pro), 32 (ala vs
pro), 99 (ala vs thr), 170 (val vs gly), and 172 (val vs gly). The human
INSIG1 protein is 84.6% and 84.2% identical to rat and mouse Insig1,
respectively. Northern blot analysis detected expression of INSIG1 in
all tissues tested, with high expression in liver. Immunofluorescence of
epitope-tagged INSIG1 in stably transfected CHO cells showed an
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localization when the cells were cultured in
either the absence or presence of sterols.

GENE FUNCTION

Using coimmunoprecipitation and tandem mass spectrometry, Yang et al.
(2002) identified INSIG1 as an ER protein that binds the sterol-sensing
domain of SREBP (see 184756) cleavage-activating protein (SCAP; 601510)
and facilitates retention of the SCAP/SREBP complex in the ER. In
sterol-depleted cells, SCAP escorts SREBPs from ER to Golgi for
proteolytic processing, thereby allowing SREBPs to stimulate cholesterol
synthesis. Using blue native-PAGE, Yang et al. (2002) showed that
sterols induce binding of SCAP to INSIG1, and this binding was
correlated with the inhibition of SCAP exit from the ER. Overexpression
of INSIG1 increased the sensitivity of cells to sterol-mediated
inhibition of SREBP processing. Mutant SCAP (tyr298 to cys) failed to
bind INSIG1 and was resistant to sterol-mediated inhibition of ER exit.
The authors concluded that by facilitating sterol-dependent ER retention
of SCAP, INSIG1 plays a central role in cholesterol homeostasis.

Sever et al. (2003) showed that degradation of HMG-CoA reductase
(142910) is accelerated by the sterol-induced binding of its
sterol-sensing domain to the ER protein INSIG1. Accelerated degradation
was inhibited by overexpression of the sterol-sensing domain of SCAP,
suggesting that both proteins bind to the same site on INSIG1. Whereas
INSIG1 binding to SCAP led to ER retention, INSIG1 binding to HMG-CoA
reductase led to accelerated degradation that could be blocked by
proteasome inhibitors. The authors concluded that INSIG1 plays an
essential role in the sterol-mediated trafficking of HMG-CoA reductase
and SCAP.

Song et al. (2005) found that rodent Gp78 (AMFR; 603243), a
membrane-bound E3 ubiquitin ligase, associated with Insig1. Insig1 bound
the membrane domain of Gp78 in the absence or presence of sterols, and
upon addition of sterols, HMG-CoA reductase was recruited to the
complex. Knockdown of Gp78 by RNA interference prevented
sterol-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of endogenous reductase.
Vcp (601023), an ATPase that participates in postubiquitination steps of
ER-associated degradation and is required for reductase degradation,
indirectly associated with Insig1 by binding Gp78. The results
identified GP78 as a ubiquitin ligase that initiates sterol-dependent
degradation of HMG-CoA reductase, and INSIG1 as the bridge between
GP78/VCP and the reductase substrate.

Li et al. (2003) presented experimental results suggesting that INSIG1
expression restricts lipogenesis in mature adipocytes and blocks
differentiation in preadipocytes. They examined gene expression in the
fat tissue of normal mice at the onset of diet-induced obesity. INSIG1
mRNA rose progressively with a high-fat diet and declined on a
restricted diet. Transfection of mouse or human INSIG1 into 3T3-L1
preadipocytes completely prevented oil red O staining and blocked
upregulation of adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein-2 (FABP2; 134640),
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma-2 (PPARG2; see 601487),
and carbohydrate response element-binding protein, while reducing
downregulation of preadipocyte factor-1 (PREF1; 176290).

Asp205 in INSIG1 and asp149 in INSIG2 are conserved residues that abut
the fourth transmembrane helix at the cytosolic side of the ER membrane.
Gong et al. (2006) found that mutation of these residues to alanine
resulted in INSIG proteins that were unable to bind SCAP and suppress
cleavage of SREBPs. The mutant INSIGs were also ineffective in
accelerating sterol-stimulated degradation of HMG CoA reductase.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Peng et al. (1997) mapped the
INSIG1 gene to chromosome 7q36.

ANIMAL MODEL

Takaishi et al. (2004) infected Zucker diabetic fatty rats (see 601007)
with recombinant adenovirus containing Insig1 or Insig2 (608660) cDNA.
Triacylglycerols in the liver and plasma of control diabetic rats rose
steeply, whereas the Insig-infected rats exhibited substantial
attenuation of hepatic steatosis and hyperlipidemia. Insig
overexpression was also associated with a reduction in the elevated
level of nuclear Srebp1c and reduced expression of Srebp1c lipogenic
target enzymes. In normal animals, overexpression of the Insigs reduced
the increase in Srebp1c mRNA and its target enzymes caused by refeeding.
Takaishi et al. (2004) concluded that both Insigs have antilipogenic
action.

Engelking et al. (2005) found that, whereas cholesterol feeding reduced
nuclear Srebps and lipogenic mRNAs in wildtype mice, this feedback
response was severely blunted in Insig1/Insig2 double-knockout mice, and
synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids was not repressed.

In cortical neuron culture, Taghibiglou et al. (2009) found that
activation of NMDA receptors resulted in increased activation and
nuclear accumulation of SREBP1. The activation was primarily mediated by
the NR2B (138252) subunit-containing receptor. Inhibition of
NMDAR-dependent SREBP1 activation by cholesterol decreased NMDA-induced
excitotoxic cell death. Similarly, shRNA against SREBP1 also resulted in
decreased cell death in culture. These findings implicated SREBP1 as a
mediator of NMDA-induced excitotoxicity. NMDAR-mediated activation of
SREBP1 was shown to result from increased Insig1 degradation, which
could be inhibited with an interference peptide. In a rat model of focal
ischemic stroke, systemic administration of the INSIG1 interference
peptide prevented SREBP1 activation, substantially reduced neuronal
damage, and improved behavioral outcome.

611665	TITLE *611665 DEAD/H BOX 54; DDX54
;;DEAD BOX RNA HELICASE, 97-KD; DP97
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DEAD box family members, including DDX54, are putative ATP-dependent RNA
helicases that play important roles in a variety of cellular processes
including cell development, differentiation, and proliferation. The name
of the gene family is derived from the amino acid sequence
Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD), one of at least 8 highly conserved motifs shared
by the family members. See also DDX8 (600396).

CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of human breast cancer cells using
antiestrogen-liganded ER-alpha (ESR1; 133430) as bait, followed by
screening a human muscle cDNA library, Rajendran et al. (2003) cloned
DDX54, which they called DP97. The deduced 865-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 97 kD. DDX54 contains 2 bipartite nuclear
localization signals, 3 nuclear receptor boxes (LXXLL motifs), a
potential CoRNR box, and several stretches of glutamate and lysine
residues. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.1-kb transcript and a
minor 4.3-kb transcript in several human cancer cell lines and in all
tissues examined, with highest expression in pancreas and lung.
Immunocytochemical studies localized DDX54 to the nucleus where it was
distributed throughout the nucleoplasm and concentrated at the nucleoli.
DDX54 colocalized with ER-alpha to speckled structures in the
nucleoplasm.

GENE FUNCTION

Rajendran et al. (2003) showed that DDX54 displayed ATP-dependent RNA
helicase activity. In vitro binding and yeast 2-hybrid analysis showed
stronger interaction for antiestrogen-liganded ER-alpha than for
estradiol-liganded ER-alpha. In DDX54-transfected Chinese hamster ovary
(CHO) cells, transactivation assays demonstrated that DDX54 repressed
ER-alpha transcriptional activity, and DDX54 also displayed nuclear
receptor corepressor activity against ER-beta (ESR2; 601663),
progesterone (PGR; 607311), glucocorticoid (GCCR; 138040), and RARA
(180240). Deletion studies and Gal4 fusion studies showed that DDX54
amino acids 589-631 function as the transcriptional repression domain
and that the C-terminal DDX54 amino acids 664-865 interact with the
C-terminal portion of nuclear receptors. Both antisense and siRNA
knockdown of DDX54 caused an increase in ER transcriptional activity and
expression of estradiol-stimulated genes.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Rajendran et al. (2003) mapped the DDX54
gene to chromosome 12q22-q23.

601311	TITLE *601311 STEROL O-ACYLTRANSFERASE 2; SOAT2
;;ACYL-CoA:CHOLESTEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE 2; ACACT2;;
ACAT2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT; EC 2.3.1.26), also known as
sterol O-acyltransferase (SOAT), catalyzes the formation of cholesterol
esters from long-chain fatty acyl CoA and cholesterol (Chang et al.,
1997).

CLONING

The esterification of intracellular sterol by the membrane-bound SOAT1
enzyme (102642) is a critical determinant of eukaryotic cell membrane
fluidity and function. Using a consensus sequence found in human and
yeast sterol O-acyltransferase genes, Yang et al. (1996) cloned the
partial sequence of a second distinct human gene of the SOAT family
(GenBank GENBANK R07932). The second human gene, designated SOAT2,
shares 47% identity with the gene encoding human SOAT1 as well as with 2
yeast sterol O-acyltransferase genes.

MAPPING

The human SOAT2 gene maps to chromosome 12q13 (Cases et al., 1998; Lee
et al., 2000).

Song et al. (2001) found that the ACAT2 gene is linked to the
insulin-like growth factor binding protein-6 gene (IGFBP6; 146735) in a
head-to-tail manner with a small intergenic region of about 1.2 kb.

GENE STRUCTURE

Song et al. (2001) determined that the ACAT2 gene spans over 18 kb and
contains 15 exons. The 5-prime flanking region of the gene contains many
cis-acting elements for multiple transcriptional regulatory factors but
lacks TATA and CCAAT boxes.

ANIMAL MODEL

Deficiency of Soat2 (Acat2) in mice results in a reduction in
cholesterol ester synthesis in the small intestine and liver, which in
turn limits intestinal cholesterol absorption, hepatic cholesterol
gallstone formation, and the accumulation of cholesterol esters in the
plasma lipoproteins. Willner et al. (2003) examined the contribution of
Soat2-derived cholesterol esters to atherosclerosis by crossing
Soat2-deficient mice with apolipoprotein E (Apoe; 107741)-deficient
mice, an atherosclerosis-susceptible strain that has impaired
apoE-mediated clearance of apoB (107730)-containing lipoproteins. Doubly
deficient mice and Soat2 +/+/apoE -/- control mice had similar
elevations of plasma apoB and total plasma lipids; however, the lipid
cores of the apoB-containing lipoproteins in doubly-null mice contained
primarily triglycerides rather than cholesterol esters. At 30 weeks of
age, only the control mice had significant atherosclerosis, which was
nearly absent in doubly-null mice. The results demonstrated the crucial
role of Soat2-derived cholesterol esters in the development of
atherosclerosis in mice and suggested that triglyceride-rich
apoB-containing lipoproteins are not as atherogenic as those containing
cholesterol esters. The results also supported the rationale of
pharmacologic inhibition of SOAT2 as a therapy for atherosclerosis.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Matthijs et al. (1997) cloned a cDNA encoding phosphomannomutase (EC
5.4.2.8), the human homolog of SEC53 or yeast phosphomannomutase from a
liver cDNA library. The deduced 262-amino acid protein has a predicted
molecular mass of 29 kD and shares 54% sequence identity with yeast
phosphomannomutase. Expression of the human cDNA in Escherichia coli
yielded an active phosphomannomutase that was purified to homogeneity.
Northern blot analysis of human tissues showed strong expression in
liver, heart, brain, and pancreas, and a lower expression in skeletal
muscle.

Wada and Sakamoto (1997) cloned the PMM1 gene from a human placenta cDNA
library.

See also PMM2 (601785).

MAPPING

By use of hybrid cell lines and fluorescence in situ hybridization,
Matthijs et al. (1997) assigned the PMM1 gene to chromosome 22q13.

Wada and Sakamoto (1997) assigned the PMM1 gene to chromosome 22q13 by

606428	TITLE *606428 UDP-GLYCOSYLTRANSFERASE 1 FAMILY, POLYPEPTIDE A3; UGT1A3
;;UGT1C
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Enzymes of the UDP glycosyltransferase (UGT; EC 2.4.1.17) superfamily
covalently link glycosyl groups to lipophilic substrates. UGT1A enzymes,
such as UGT1A3, efficiently use UDP-glucuronic acid as the glycosyl
donor and are invaluable in detoxifying both endogenous and foreign
chemicals, because the glycosylated chemical is more water soluble and
therefore more readily excreted. Several UGT1A enzymes, including
UGT1A3, are encoded by the UGT1A gene complex on chromosome 2q37. Within
this complex, 9 viable first exons are independently spliced to 4 common
exons to generate 9 UGT1A transcripts with unique 5-prime ends and
identical 3-prime ends. UGT1A3, like each first exon within the UGT1A
gene complex, is considered a unique gene linked to the 4 common exons
(Gong et al., 2001; Mackenzie et al., 2005). See 191740 for further
information on the UGT1A gene complex.

CLONING

By screening a colon cDNA library, followed by RT-PCR of liver mRNA,
Mojarrabi et al. (1996) obtained a cDNA encoding UGT1A3. The deduced
534-amino acid protein has 5 potential N-glycosylation sites and its
first exon is identical to that of UGT1 exon 1c (Ritter et al., 1992).
Expression in COS-7 cells revealed a major protein of 55 kD. By RT-PCR
analysis, Mojarrabi et al. (1996) detected expression of UGT1A3 in human
liver and colon.

GENE FUNCTION

Expression of UGT1A3 in COS-7 cells by Mojarrabi et al. (1996) revealed
glucuronidation activity toward estrone, 2-hydroxyestrone, and
metabolites of benzo[a]pyrene.

MAPPING

Using DNA probes prepared from the 5-prime terminal portion of 4 cDNA
clones for UGT1 and a sequence common to all 4 clones isolated from the
3-prime terminal portion of one of the clones, Moghrabi et al. (1992)
analyzed a panel of 16 human/rodent somatic cell hybrid DNAs by Southern
blot analysis to locate the gene on chromosome 2.

609827	TITLE *609827 PELLINO, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 3; PELI3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Toll-like receptors (TLRs; see 603030) and IL1R (IL1R1; 147810) are part
of the innate immune response aimed at mobilizing defense mechanisms in
response in infection or injury. Pellino proteins, such as PELI3, are
intermediate components in the signaling cascades initiated by TLRs and
IL1R (Jensen and Whitehead, 2003).

CLONING

By searching for sequences similar to PELI1 (614797) and PELI2 (614798),
followed by 3-prime RACE, Jensen and Whitehead (2003) cloned 2 splice
variants of PELI3, which they called PELI3-alpha and PELI3-beta. The
deduced 469-amino acid PELI3-alpha protein contains 24 amino acids
encoded by exon 3 that are absent in the 445-amino acid PELI3-beta
protein. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.5-kb transcript expressed
at high levels in brain, heart, and testis, and at lower levels in
kidney, liver, lung, placenta, small intestine, spleen, and stomach.
RT-PCR, but not Northern blot analysis, also showed PELI3 expression in
muscle and colon.

GENE FUNCTION

Jensen and Whitehead (2003) found that PELI3 interacted directly with
IL1R-associated kinase-1 (IRAK1; 300283), TNF receptor-associated
factor-6 (TRAF6; 602355), TNF-beta-activated kinase-1 (TAK1, or MAP3K7;
602614), and NFKB-inducing kinase (NIK, or MAP3K14; 604655) in an IL1
(see IL1A; 147760)-dependent manner. In reporter gene assays, PELI3
activated JUN (165160) and ELK1 (311040), but not NFKB (see 164011).
Jensen and Whitehead (2003) concluded that PELI3 plays a role in the
innate immune response and may be a scaffolding protein.

Butler et al. (2005) found that both isoforms of PELI3 could induce
expression of a reporter gene dependent on p38 MAPK (MAPK14; 600289)
activation in human embryonic kidney cells. Activation of p38 MAPK by
PELI3 coincided with binding of PELI3 to IRAK1. TRAF6 and TAK1 were
identified as downstream mediators of p38 MAPK activation by PELI3.
PELI3 promoted translocation of the p38 MAPK substrate, MAPK-activated
protein kinase-2 (MAPKAPK2; 602006), from the nucleus to the cytoplasm
and activated the transcription factor CREB (123810) in a p38
MAPK-dependent manner.

GENE STRUCTURE

Jensen and Whitehead (2003) determined that the PELI3 gene contains 8
exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Jensen and Whitehead (2003) mapped the
PELI3 gene to chromosome 11.

611725	TITLE *611725 POTASSIUM CHANNEL TETRAMERIZATION DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 7; KCTD7
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the KCTD gene family, including KCTD7, encode predicted
proteins containing an N-terminal domain that is homologous to the T1
domain in voltage-gated potassium channels (see KCNA1, 176260). KCTD7
displays a primary sequence and hydropathy profile indicating
intracytoplasmic localization. EST database analysis showed that KCTD7
is expressed in human and mouse brain (Van Bogaert et al., 2007).

CLONING

Staropoli et al. (2012) detected expression of a full-length 31-kD Kctd7
isoform in mouse brain. Other major immunoreactive bands included a
28-kD species in the spleen, liver, and kidneys, a 37-kD species in the
kidneys, and a 62-kD form most likely corresponding to a stable dimer.
The presence of multiple bands was consistent with alternative splicing
and tissue-specific regulation.

Kousi et al. (2012) found expression of the Kctd7 gene in cultured mouse
hippocampal cells. Expression was found in the cell soma, in neuritic
varicosities along the developing neuronal extensions, and in neurite
growth cones, but not in the nucleus. Kctd7 was widely expressed in
neurons throughout the intact mouse brain, including in cortical
neurons, in granular and pyramidal cell layers of the hippocampus, and
in cerebellar Purkinje cells. However, not all neuronal cells were
immunopositive for Kctd7, and expression was not seen in astrocytes or
microglial cells. Expression was constant from P5 to 2 months in
cerebellar lysates. Overexpression of KCTD7 in HeLa and COS-1 cells,
which do not express endogenous KCTD7, showed diffuse cytosolic
localization, with no colocalization with markers for endosomes, ER,
Golgi, lysosomes, or the cytoskeleton.

MAPPING

The KCTD7 gene maps to chromosome 7q11.2 (Van Bogaert et al., 2007).

GENE FUNCTION

Azizieh et al. (2011) demonstrated that KCTD7 expression hyperpolarizes
the cell membrane and reduces the excitability of transfected neurons in
patch clamp experiments. Kctd7 was expressed in hippocampal and Purkinje
cells of the murine brain. Immunoprecipitation assays showed that KCTD7
directly interacted with cullin-3 (CUL3; 603136), a component of the
ubiquitin ligase complex.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 affected members of a large consanguineous Moroccan family with
progressive myoclonic epilepsy-3 (EPM3; 611726), Van Bogaert et al.
(2007) identified a homozygous mutation in the KCTD7 gene (611725.0001).

In 2 Mexican sibs with infantile onset of progressive myoclonic epilepsy
and pathologic findings of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis in multiple
cell types, Staropoli et al. (2012) identified a homozygous mutation in
the KCTD7 gene (R184C; 611725.0002). The mutation was identified by
whole-exome sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Staropoli et
al. (2012) designated the phenotype CLN14 (611726). KCTD7 mutations were
not found in 32 additional CLN samples.

In affected members of 7 unrelated families with progressive myoclonic
epilepsy-3, Kousi et al. (2012) identified 6 different mutations in the
KCTD7 gene (see, e.g., 611725.0003-611725.0007). All mutations were in
the homozygous or compound heterozygous state. The initial mutations
were found in 2 probands by homozygosity mapping followed by candidate
gene sequencing, and the other mutations were found by screening of the
gene in 108 Turkish patients and 1 Pakistani patient with the phenotype.
Four mutations were missense, 1 was an in-frame deletion, and 1 was
truncating. None of the patients with KCTD7 mutations tested had
evidence of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis on skin biopsy, and none of
22 additional patients with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis carried
mutations in the KCTD7 gene.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
EPILEPSY, PROGRESSIVE MYOCLONIC 3, WITHOUT INTRACELLULAR INCLUSIONS
KCTD7, ARG99TER

In 3 affected members of a large consanguineous Moroccan family with
progressive myoclonic epilepsy-3 (611726), Van Bogaert et al. (2007)
identified a homozygous C-to-T transition in exon 2 of the KCTD7 gene,
resulting in an arg99-to-ter (R99X) substitution. The patients had onset
of myoclonic seizures and neurodegeneration between 16 and 24 months of
age. The phenotype was severe and included mental retardation. The
unaffected parents were heterozygous for the mutation. Ultrastructural
analysis of a skin biopsy was normal.

KCTD7, ARG184CYS

In 2 Mexican sibs with infantile onset of progressive myoclonic epilepsy
(611726) and intracellular inclusions, consistent with a diagnosis of
neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (designated CLN14), Staropoli et al.
(2012) identified a homozygous 550C-T transition in exon 4 of the KCTD7
gene, resulting in an arg184-to-cys (R184C) substitution. The mutation
was found by exome sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Each
unaffected parent was heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found
in over 6,000 controls. In cerebellar cells, wildtype KCTD7 showed
broad, punctate cytoplasmic localization and distinct signal at the
plasma membrane, whereas mutant A184C showed more diffuse cytoplasmic
localization, markedly diminished signaling at the plasma membrane, and
prominent cytoplasmic aggregates. These results suggested that the
mutation affects the trafficking and/or solubility of KCTD7. Studies in
HEK293T cells showed that the R184C mutation abrogated the interaction
with cullin-3 (CUL3; 603136), which Staropoli et al. (2012) suggested
may lead to an accumulation of toxic intracellular proteins.

gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination
(Ile199SerfsTer74).

homozygous 818A-T transversion in exon 4 of the KCTD7 gene, resulting in
an asn273-to-ile (N273I) substitution at a highly conserved residue.
Another Turkish boy with the disorder was compound heterozygous for
N273I and a 343G-T transversion, resulting in an asp115-to-tyr (D115Y;
611725.0006) substitution. The D115Y substitution did not occur at a
highly conserved residue and was predicted to be benign, but neither
mutation was found in 150 Turkish control chromosomes.

;;MLT;;
PARACASPASE
MALT1/API2 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The MALT1 gene encodes a caspase-like cysteine protease that is
essential for nuclear factor-kappa-B (NFKB; see 164011) activation
downstream of cell surface receptors (summary by Jabara et al., 2013).

CLONING

A t(11;18)(q21;q21) translocation is a characteristic cytogenetic
abnormality in low-grade B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid
tissue (MALT) type (Ott et al., 1997). By FISH, Dierlamm et al. (1999)
mapped the position of YAC probes on 11q21-q22.31 relative to the
breakpoints on chromosome 18. By searching EST databases, they
identified a 178-bp fragment that represented an exon of a human gene,
which the authors called MLT (MALT lymphoma-associated translocation),
that was disrupted by the translocation. The authors stated that a
consensus MLT cDNA encodes a 729-amino acid protein, but later revised
the number of amino acids to 824 (GenBank GENBANK AF130356). The 3-prime
sequence of MLT encodes 2 putative Ig-like C2-type domains. Sequence
analysis of amplified cDNA from a lymphoma patient showed that the
3-prime end of MLT was fused to the 5-prime portion of API2 (601721), an
inhibitor of apoptosis located at 11q22. The authors noted that API2 is
highly expressed in adult lymphoid tissue.

Using exon amplification and cDNA library screening, Akagi et al. (1999)
also identified a cDNA encoding MALT1 at the 18q21 breakpoint region.
They found that the cDNA encodes an 813-amino acid protein, apparently a
splice variant of the sequence reported by Dierlamm et al. (1999).
Northern blot analysis revealed 4.5- and 3.1-kb transcripts that showed
highest expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, moderate or
weak expression in bone marrow, thymus, lymph node, colon, and lung, and
no expression in liver. Akagi et al. (1999) also detected expression in
hematopoietic cell lines and aberrant expression of transcripts larger
than 4.5 kb in 4 of 5 patients with MALT lymphoma; in the other patient,
there was only weak expression of normal-sized transcripts.

GENE FUNCTION

Using mouse models, Ruland et al. (2003) demonstrated that MALT1 is
essential for T-cell activation, proliferation, and IL2 (147680)
production in response to T-cell receptor ligation and strictly required
for signal-specific NF-kappa-B (NFKB; see 164011) activation induced by
the T-cell receptor but not TNF-alpha (191160) or IL1 (see 147760)
signaling. MALT1 operates downstream of BCL10 (603517), controls the
catalytic activity of the canonical I-kappa-B kinase (see 600664)
complex, and regulates the signaling of JNK (601158) and p38 (600289)
MAP kinases. In contrast to BCL10 disruption, however, inactivation of
MALT1 has only mild effects on B-cell activation and does not cause
defects during neurodevelopment. Thus, Ruland et al. (2003) concluded
that MALT1 is an essential regulator of BCL10 signaling that is
differentially required depending on cellular context.

Using biochemical and genetic approaches, Wegener et al. (2006)
demonstrated that IKKB (IKBKB; 603258) is critical for regulation of the
CARMA1 (CARD11; 607210)-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex. They found that IKKB
is required not only for initial complex formation, but also for
triggering disengagement of BCL10 and MALT1 by phosphorylation of the C
terminus of BCL10, thereby negatively influencing T-cell receptor
signaling. Wegener et al. (2006) proposed a model in which IKKB is
associated with BCL10-MALT1 in resting T cells. Following T-cell
activation, protein kinase C-theta (PRKCQ; 600448) phosphorylates CARMA1
and induces association of CARMA1 with BCL10-MALT1. Formation of the BCM
complex induces maximal activation of IKK through activation of IKKG
(IKBKG; 300248). IKKB phosphorylates BCL10 in its MALT1 interaction
domain, causing BCL10 and MALT1 to disassociate, resulting in
attenuation of NFKB signaling and cytokine production.

By immunoblot analysis, Coornaert et al. (2008) showed that MALT1 is a
functional cysteine protease activated by T-cell receptor stimulation
and that it rapidly cleaves A20 (TNFAIP; 191163) after arg439, impairing
its NFKB inhibitor function. Coornaert et al. (2008) concluded that A20
is a substrate of MALT1 and that MALT1 proteolytic activity is important
in the fine tuning of T cell antigen receptor signaling.

Using immunoprecipitation, immunoblot, and FACS analysis, Ferch et al.
(2009) showed that aggressive activated B cell-like (ABC) diffuse large
B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cells, but not germinal center B cell-like (GCB)
DLBCL, possess constitutively assembled CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM)
complexes that continuously and selectively process A20. Inhibition of
MALT1 blocks A20 and BCL10 cleavage, reduces NFKB activity, and
decreases the expression of NFKB targets BCLXL (BCL2L1; (600039), IL6
(147620), and IL10 (124092)). Inhibition of MALT1 paracaspase leads to
ABC-DLBCL cell death and growth retardation. Ferch et al. (2009)
concluded that MALT1 paracaspase activity has a growth-promoting role,
specifically in ABC-DLBCL cells, and proposed that MALT1 protease
activity is a potential target for pharmacologic treatment of ABC-DLBCL.

MAPPING

Dierlamm et al. (1999) and Akagi et al. (1999) mapped the MALT1 gene to
chromosome 18q21.

CYTOGENETICS

- API2/MALT1 Fusion Oncoprotein

To gain insight into the mechanism that generates the t(11;18)
translocation in MALT lymphomas, Sato et al. (2001) cloned and sequenced
an API2-MALT1 fused transcript as well as genomic DNA of the t(11;18)
translocation from a MALT lymphoma. They localized the API2 breakpoint
within intron 7. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that the genomic
breakpoint junction possesses the consensus heptamers of immunoglobulin
V(D)J recombination signal sequences, all the matches being completely
present on the API2 allele and 5 of 7 matches on the MALT1 allele. These
data suggested that the translocation in the MALT lymphoma may have been
mediated in part by an aberrant V(D)J recombination event.

In approximately 5 to 10% of gastric MALT lymphomas, evidence of
Helicobacter pylori infection is absent. Ye et al. (2003) reviewed the
clinical data and histology of 17 such cases and examined them for the
t(11;18)(q21;q21) translocation and BCL10 expression pattern. In each
case, the absence of H. pylori was confirmed by negative serology and
histology/immunohistochemistry. In 5 cases the disease was first treated
with antibiotics, and none of them showed any endoscopic or histologic
response. Review of the histology failed to identify any apparent
difference between gastric MALT lymphomas with or without H. pylori
infection. The t(11;18) translocation was identified in 9 (53%) of 17
cases. Two translocation-positive lymphomas were treated by partial
gastrectomy and more than 16 years later showed lymphoma relapse in the
gastric stump with dissemination to other mucosal sites, poorly
responsive to therapy.

Rosebeck et al. (2011) demonstrated that the API2/MALT1 fusion
oncoprotein created by the recurrent t(11;18)(q21;q21) in MALT lymphoma
induces proteolytic cleavage of NF-kappa-B-inducing kinase (NIK; 604655)
at arginine-325. NIK cleavage requires the concerted actions of both
fusion partners and generates a C-terminal NIK fragment that retains
kinase activity and is resistant to proteasomal degradation. The
resulting deregulated NIK activity is associated with constitutive
noncanonical NF-kappa-B signaling, enhanced B-cell adhesion, and
apoptosis resistance. Rosebeck et al. (2011) concluded that their study
revealed the gain-of-function proteolytic activity of a fusion
oncoprotein and highlighted the importance of the noncanonical
NF-kappa-B pathway in B lymphoproliferative disease.

- Translocation t(14;18)(q32;q21)

The MALT1 gene is located approximately 5 Mb centromeric to the BCL2
gene (151430) on 18q21. Sanchez-Izquierdo et al. (2003) reported 2
lymphoma patients, 1 with MALT lymphoma and the other with aggressive
marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), with a t(14;18)(q32;q21) translocation
cytogenetically identical to the frequent translocation involving BCL2
in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (see 605027); however, in these 2 cases
FISH indicated involvement of the MALT1 gene. There had been other
evidence suggesting that genes other than BCL2 in the 18q21 band can
account for lymphoma; see, e.g., the follicular-variant-translocation
gene (FVT1; 136440).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 sibs, born of consanguineous Lebanese parents, with primary
immunodeficiency-12 (IMD12; 615468), Jabara et al. (2013) identified a
homozygous mutation in the MALT1 gene (S89I; 604860.0001). The mutation,
which was found by homozygosity mapping and whole-exome sequencing,
segregated with the disorder in the family. Patient T cells showed
impaired degradation of the NFKB inhibitor I-kappa-B-alpha (NFKB1A;
164008) and decreased IL2 (147680) expression after T-cell activation,
and the mutant cDNA failed to rescue defective activation of T cells
from Malt1-null mice, consistent with a loss of function. The patients
had onset of recurrent bacterial and candidal infections in infancy. The
patients died at ages 7 and 13.5 years. Laboratory studies showed normal
numbers of lymphocytes, but poor antibody response and decreased T-cell
proliferative responses to mitogens. The clinical and laboratory
findings were similar to those of patients with IMD11 (615206), which is
caused by loss-of-function mutations in the CARD11 gene (607210). The
findings showed the importance of MALT1 and the CBM complex for
activation of NFKB in proper T-cell function.

ANIMAL MODEL

Ruefli-Brasse et al. (2003) generated mice deficient in Malt1
(paracaspase) by targeted disruption and found that primary T- and
B-cell lymphocytes from these mice were defective in antigen
receptor-induced NF-kappa-B activation, cytokine production, and
proliferation. Paracaspase acts downstream of BCL10 to induce NF-kappa-B
activation and is required for the normal development of B cells,
indicating that paracaspase provides the missing link between BCL10 and
activation of the I-kappa-B kinase complex.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
IMMUNODEFICIENCY 12 (1 family)
MALT1, SER89ILE

In 2 sibs, born of consanguineous Lebanese parents, with primary
immunodeficiency-12 (IMD12; 615468), Jabara et al. (2013) identified a
homozygous c.266G-T transversion in the MALT1 gene, resulting in a
ser89-to-ile (S89I) substitution at a highly conserved residue in the
CARD domain. The mutation was predicted to disrupt the structure of the
domain and render the mutant protein susceptible to degradation. The
mutation, which was found by homozygosity mapping and whole-exome
sequencing, segregated with the disorder in the family. The mutation was
not present in the dbSNP or 1000 Genomes databases, or in 150 ethnically
matched controls. Cells from 1 of the patients showed normal amounts of
mutant mRNA, but no detectable MALT1 protein. Patient T cells showed
decreased expression of IL2 after T-cell activation, and the mutant cDNA
failed to rescue defective activation of T cells from Malt1-null mice,
consistent with a loss of function. The patients had onset of recurrent
bacterial and candidal infections in infancy. The patients died at ages
7 and 13.5 years. Laboratory studies showed normal numbers of
lymphocytes, but poor antibody response and decreased T-cell
proliferative responses to mitogens.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Demuth et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA clone, designated pHKB3, encoding a
human erythrocyte surface protein band 3-like gene product. Peptide
mapping shows substantial sequence homology between the erythrocyte band
3 protein (109270) and a band 3-like protein found in leukocytes.
Palumbo et al. (1986) described the partial sequence of a 2.7-kb human
cDNA clone encoding a band 3-related protein in nonerythroid cells.
Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence for this cDNA with the
amino acid sequences of mouse and human erythroid band 3 proteins
confirmed that the human clone is related to but distinct from erythroid
band 3. Palumbo et al. (1986) symbolized the gene as HKB3, in part after
the name of the human cell line studied.

Tanner (1993) referred to this nonerythroid anion exchanger as AE2. The
ability of AE2 to mediate anion transport has been confirmed. Northern
blotting studies showed that the AE2 gene is transcribed in a wide
variety of tissues. In the mouse, Lindsey et al. (1990) found that AE2
is expressed only in choroid plexus, the site of cerebrospinal fluid
production. Kudrycki et al. (1990) found that, in the rat, AE2 is
particularly abundant in the stomach and portions of the
gastrointestinal tract.

GENE STRUCTURE

Medina et al. (1997) determined that the AE2 gene spans approximately 17
kb and consists of 23 exons.

MAPPING

Using somatic cell genetics and in situ hybridization, Palumbo et al.
(1986) mapped the HKB3 gene to 7q35-q36. Showe et al. (1993) identified
an MboI RFLP in the EPB3L1 gene. White et al. (1994) demonstrated that
the murine AE2 gene is located on chromosome 5. This result was obtained
by analysis of recombinant inbred lines and by interspecific backcross
analysis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Medina et al. (2003) disrupted the mouse Ae2 gene in a manner that
prevented the expression of 3 Ae2 isoforms normally found in testis.
Male Ae2 -/- mice, but not female Ae2 -/- mice, were infertile.
Histopathologic analysis of mutant testis showed an interruption in
spermiogenesis, with only a few late spermatids and a complete absence
of spermatozoa in the seminiferous tubules. The number of apoptotic
bodies was increased in the seminiferous tubules and in the epididymis,
which also showed squamous metaplasia of the epididymal epithelium.

DESCRIPTION 
MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Loftus et al. (1999) mapped the PM5 gene (see
NOMO1; 609157) to a region of chromosome 16p13.1-p11.2 that shows a high
degree of gene duplication. Scott (2004) mapped 3 copies of the PM5
gene, including NOMO3, within this region. The NOMO3 gene maps
centromeric to the XYLT1 gene (608124) and telomeric to the SMG1 gene
(607032).

NECTIN 3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Nectins (e.g., PVRL1, 600644) are immunoglobulin-like adhesion molecules
that interact with afadin (AF6; 159559). Afadin is an actin
filament-binding protein that connects nectins to the actin
cytoskeleton. The nectin-afadin system organizes adherens junctions
cooperatively with the cadherin (see 192090)-catenin (see 116805) system
in epithelial cells.

CLONING

By searching an EST database using PRR1, PRR2 (PVRL2; 600798), and PVR
(173850) as queries, followed by RT-PCR of placenta mRNA, Reymond et al.
(2000) cloned a full-length cDNA encoding PRR3. The deduced 550-amino
acid PRR3 protein has a calculated molecular mass of 55.4 kD and
contains an N-terminal hydrophobic leader sequence; an ectodomain
containing a V-type Ig domain and 2 C-type Ig domains bracketed by 6
cysteine residues; a hydrophobic transmembrane region; and a long
cytoplasmic sequence. PRR3 also has 6 potential N-glycosylation sites.
Northern blot analysis revealed PRR3 expression predominantly in
placenta and testis, with faint or no expression in other tissues. A
major transcript of 2.8 kb and minor transcripts of 9.5, 6.0, and 4.7 kb
were detected in placenta. PRR3 was also expressed in mammalian
epithelial cell lines. Flow cytometry showed expression of PRR3 at the
surface of transfected COS-1 cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using coimmunoprecipitation experiments, Reymond et al. (2000) found
that PRR3 interacts with both the L- and S-afadin isoforms in a similar
ratio.

Using immunolocalization of adult mouse hippocampal sections Mizoguchi
et al. (2002) found that the nectin-afadin system colocalizes with the
cadherin-catenin system at synapses between mossy fiber terminals and
dendrites of pyramidal cells in the CA3 area. Nectins-1 and -3
asymmetrically localize at the pre- and postsynaptic sides of puncta
adherentia junctions, respectively. During development, nectins-1 and -3
asymmetrically localize not only at puncta adherentia junctions but also
at synaptic junctions. Using rat hippocampal neurons in culture,
Mizoguchi et al. (2002) observed that inhibition of the nectin-based
adhesion results in a decrease in synapse size and a concomitant
increase in synapse number.

Togashi et al. (2011) found that mouse hair cells and supporting cells
express the immunoglobulin-like adhesion molecules nectin-1 (600644) and
-3, respectively, and that their interaction mediates the heterotypic
adhesion between these 2 cell types. Genetic removal of nectin-1 or -3
disrupted the checkerboard-like pattern, inducing aberrant attachment
between hair cells. When cells expressing either nectin-1 or -3 were
cocultured, they arranged themselves into a mosaic pattern. Thus,
Togashi et al. (2011) concluded that nectin-1 and nectin-3 promote the
formation of the checkerboard-like pattern of the auditory epithelia.

ANIMAL MODEL

Inagaki et al. (2006) found that male, but not female, nectin-3 -/- mice
were infertile. Phase contrast microscopy revealed that spermatozoa of
mutant mice showed severe malformation of the head and midpiece.
Nectin-3 knockout resulted in defects in the later steps of sperm
morphogenesis, including distorted nuclei and abnormal distribution of
mitochondria, as well as loss of nectin-2 (PVRL2; 600798) at
Sertoli-spermatid junctions. The localization of nectin-2 at
Sertoli-Sertoli junctions was unaffected.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PVRL3
gene to chromosome 3 (TMAP stSG2552).

;;KALLIKREIN 11;;
PROTEASE, SERINE, 20; PRSS20;;
TRYPSIN-LIKE SERINE PROTEASE; TLSP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

KLK11 belongs to the kallikrein subfamily of serine proteases, which are
involved in a variety of enzymatic processes (Gan et al., 2000).

CLONING

By PCR of human hippocampus cDNA using primers derived from mouse
neuropsin cDNA sequences corresponding to conserved regions of serine
proteases, Yoshida et al. (1998) identified a novel serine protease,
KLK11, which they named TLSP. The deduced 260-amino acid protein
contains a signal peptide, 3 key amino acids essential for serine
protease activity, an asp residue in a position that suggests a
trypsin-type substrate specificity for basic amino acids at the P1
position, conserved amino acids that can form an oxyanion hole, and a
potential N-glycosylation site. KLK11 shares 48% amino acid sequence
identity with mouse neuropsin, 43% identity with both human trypsin-1
(PRSS1; 276000) and human kallikrein (KLK1; 147910), and 38% identity
with the mouse nerve growth factor gamma subunit. Western blot analysis
of recombinant KLK11 suggested that the protein is secreted and
posttranslationally processed. Northern blot analysis of RNA from
keratinocyte primary cultures detected a 1.1-kb KLK11 transcript.

By PCR of 35 adult and fetal tissues, Gan et al. (2000) detected high
KLK11 expression in prostate, testis, trachea, pancreas, salivary gland,
thyroid, parathyroid, lung, stomach, and adult and fetal skin. Weaker
expression was detected in heart, mammary gland, uterus, colon, and
small intestine, with little to no expression in other tissues examined.

GENE STRUCTURE

Elliott et al. (2006) determined that the KLK11 gene contains 6 exons,
the first of which is noncoding.

MAPPING

Harvey et al. (2000) mapped the KLK11 gene to chromosome 19q13.4 in the
KLK gene cluster between KLK10 (602673) and KLK12 (605539). They noted
that KLK5 (605643) to KLK14 are transcribed telomere to centromere.

606530	TITLE *606530 CYTOCHROME P450, SUBFAMILY XXVIIA, POLYPEPTIDE 1; CYP27A1
;;CYP27;;
STEROL 27-HYDROXYLASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Sterol 27-hydroxylase, a mitochondrial cytochrome P450, together with 2
protein cofactors, adrenodoxin (103260) and adrenodoxin reductase
(103270), hydroxylates a variety of sterols at the C27 position. In the
bile acid synthesis pathway, sterol 27-hydroxylase catalyzes the first
step in the oxidation of the side chain of sterol intermediates (summary
by Cali and Russell, 1991).

CLONING

Cali and Russell (1991) cloned cDNAs for human sterol 27-hydroxylase
from a liver cDNA library by cross-hybridization with a previously
cloned rabbit cDNA probe. DNA sequence predicted a protein with a
33-amino acid mitochondrial signal sequence followed by a mature protein
of 498 amino acids. RNA blotting experiments demonstrated mRNAs of
approximately 1.8 to 2.2 kb in liver and fibroblast cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Leitersdorf et al. (1993) demonstrated that the CYP27 gene contains 9
exons and 8 introns and encompasses at least 18.6 kb of DNA. The
putative promoter region was found to be rich in GC residues and
contained potential binding sites for the transcription factor SP1
(189906) and the liver transcription factor LF-B1.

MAPPING

Using the human CYP27 cDNA in a study of a panel of Chinese
hamster/human hybrid cell clones, Cali and Russell (1991) assigned the
CYP27A1 gene to chromosome 2 and further regionalized it to 2q33-qter by
study of hybrid cells containing various parts of chromosome 2. The
Cyp27 gene was similarly mapped to chromosome 1 of the mouse.

GENE FUNCTION

Shinkyo et al. (2004) compared vitamin D metabolism by recombinant human
CYP2R1 (608713) and CYP27A1. A clear difference was observed between
CYP2R1 and CYP27A1 in metabolism of vitamin D2: CYP2R1 showed
hydroxylase activity at the C25 position, whereas CYP27A1 showed
hydroxylase activity at the C24 and C27 positions. CYP2R1 also showed
significantly higher affinity and C25 hydroxylation activity toward
vitamin D3 than CYP27A1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX; 213700), Cali et
al. (1991) identified mutations in the CYP27A1 gene
(606530.0001-606530.0002).

Guyant-Marechal et al. (2005) described a 53-year-old man with an
unusual CTX phenotype, involving no mental retardation and a progressive
neuropsychiatric disorder beginning at age 44, in whom they identified
compound heterozygosity for mutations in the CYP27A1 gene
(606530.0013-606530.0014).

ANIMAL MODEL

By targeted disruption, Rosen et al. (1998) generated mice deficient in
sterol 27-hydroxylase. They found that mice with disrupted Cyp27 had
normal plasma levels of cholesterol, retinol, tocopherol, and
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Excretion of fecal bile acids was decreased
(less than 20% of normal), and formation of bile acids from
tritium-labeled 7-alpha-hydroxycholesterol was less than 15% of normal.
Compensatory upregulation of hepatic cholesterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase and
hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (9- and 2- to 3-fold increases in
mRNA levels, respectively) was found. No CTX-related pathologic
abnormalities were observed. In CTX, there was an increased formation of
25-hydroxylated bile alcohols and cholestanol. In bile and feces of
Cyp27 -/- mice, only traces of bile alcohols were found and there was no
evidence of cholestanol accumulation. Rosen et al. (1998) concluded that
sterol 27-hydroxylase is more important for bile acid synthesis in mice
than in humans, and that their results did not support the contention
that 27-hydroxylated steroids are critical for maintenance of
cholesterol homeostasis or levels of vitamin D metabolites in the
circulation.

Meir et al. (2002) developed transgenic mice overexpressing human
CYP27A1. Transgenic mice showed elevated blood and tissue levels of
27-hydroxycholesterol and reduced blood levels of 24-hydroxycholesterol.
There were no gross morphologic differences between the overexpressing
mice and their controls. Total cholesterol and triglyceride levels were
unaffected, as were serum lathosterol and 7-alpha-hydroxycholesterol
levels. Biliary bile acid composition and fecal neutral steroids were
slightly affected. Meir et al. (2002) concluded that levels of
27-hydroxycholesterol are not critically important for cholesterol
homeostasis in mice.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CEREBROTENDINOUS XANTHOMATOSIS
CYP27A1, ARG446CYS

Cali et al. (1991) identified 2 different mutations in unrelated cases
of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (213700). Both involved single
basepair substitutions that converted arginine codons (CGPy) to cysteine
codons (TGPy). One mutation, called by them CTX1, was at codon 446 near
the heme ligand, cys444. The second, called CTX2, was at codon 362 in
the adrenodoxin binding region.

CEREBROTENDINOUS XANTHOMATOSIS
CYP27A1, 1-BP DEL

A relatively high prevalence of CTX (213700) has been noted in Jews of
Moroccan origin. By single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis
followed by sequence analysis, Leitersdorf et al. (1993) identified 2
mutations: deletion of a thymidine in exon 4 and a G-to-A transition at
the 3-prime splice acceptor site of intron 4 (606530.0004). The deletion
of the thymidine resulted in a frameshift and a premature termination
codon 35 nucleotides downstream. Two patients were homozygous for the
frameshift. In 4 families that were studied, 1 was homozygous for the
splice mutation, 2 were homozygous for the frameshift mutation, and 1
was a genetic compound for the 2 mutations. Only the fourth family was
nonconsanguineous.

CYP27A1, ARG441GLN

In 2 Japanese homozygotes, as well as a heterozygous subject, with
cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (213700), Kim et al. (1994) identified a
G-to-A transition, changing codon 441 from CGG (arg) to CAG (gln).

.0006
CEREBROTENDINOUS XANTHOMATOSIS
CYP27A1, ARG441TRP

In a Japanese homozygote with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (213700),
Kim et al. (1994) demonstrated that the CYP27 gene contained a C-to-T
transition that converted codon 441 from CGG (arg) to TGG (trp). Both
this and the arg441-to-gln mutation (606530.0005) resulted in a change
in the restriction pattern with the enzymes StuI or HpaII.

.0007
CEREBROTENDINOUS XANTHOMATOSIS
CYP27A1, ARG372GLN

In a Japanese family with CTX (213700), Chen et al. (1997) identified a
G-to-A transition, resulting in an arg372-to-gln amino acid substitution
in the CYP27 protein. The mutation, homozygous in 1 family, was found in
compound heterozygous state in a second Japanese family with a G-to-A
substitution at amino acid position 441 (arg441 to gln; 606530.0005).
They stated that Japanese CTX patients accounted for nearly one-third of
all the CTX patients reported in the world up to that time.

.0008
CEREBROTENDINOUS XANTHOMATOSIS
CYP27A1, ARG362SER

In a 57-year-old Japanese male with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis
(213700), Chen et al. (1998) identified a C-to-A transversion in the -2
position of exon 6, leading to an arg-to-ser substitution at codon 362.
This mutation, in addition to causing an amino acid substitution, also
affected normal splicing of exon 6, causing activation of a cryptic
5-prime splice site 88 bp upstream from the 5-prime end of exon 6.

.0009
CEREBROTENDINOUS XANTHOMATOSIS
CYP27A1, IVS7, G-A, +1

In a Japanese family with CTX (213700), Shiga et al. (1999) found
homozygosity for a G-to-A transition at the 5-prime end in intron 7.
Sequencing disclosed a direct conjunction of exon 6 and exon 8, i.e.,
skipping of exon 7.

.0010
CEREBROTENDINOUS XANTHOMATOSIS
CYP27A1, ARG441TRP

Toba et al. (2002) described a Japanese patient with cerebrotendinous
xanthomatosis (213700) and compound heterozygosity for arg441-to-trp
(R441W) and arg 372-to-gln (R372Q; 606530.0007) mutations in the CYP27A1
gene. The R441W substitution was the result of a C-to-T transition at
nucleotide 1441 in exon 8. The patient was a 33-year-old male who had
tendon hypertrophy, gait instability, difficulty in swallowing, juvenile
cataract, and mental retardation, but not the rapid speech phenomenon.
Dysarthria and excessive salivation were unusual features.

.0011
CEREBROTENDINOUS XANTHOMATOSIS
CYP27A1, GLY112GLU

In a 49-year-old woman of Portuguese and Cape Verdean descent who
presented with elevated cholestanol levels, markedly reduced
mitochondrial 27-hydroxylase activity, and altered bile acid
composition, Lamon-Fava et al. (2002) found that cerebrotendinous
xanthomatosis (213700) was associated with compound heterozygosity for a
gly112-to-glu (G112E) mutation and a 5-nucleotide deletion in exon 5
(from nucleotides 965 to 969) that resulted in frameshift and insertion
of a premature codon at position 296 (606530.0012). The patient had a
history of mild intellectual disability and the development of Achilles
tendon xanthomas beginning in early adolescence. She had received more
than 18 years of treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid, which effectively
prevented progression of the disease.

In a 53-year-old man with an unusual cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis
phenotype (213700), involving xanthomas since adolescence, no mental
retardation, and a progressive neuropsychiatric disorder beginning at
age 44, Guyant-Marechal et al. (2005) identified compound heterozygosity
for a 1016C-T transition in exon 5 of the CYP27A1 gene, resulting in a
thr339-to-met (T339M) substitution on 1 allele, and a 1435C-G
transversion in exon 8, resulting in an arg479-to-gly (R479G)
substitution on the other allele.

606570	TITLE *606570 SECRETED FRIZZLED-RELATED PROTEIN 4; SFRP4
;;FRIZZLED-RELATED PROTEIN, HUMAN ENDOMETRIUM; FRPHE
DESCRIPTION The WNT (e.g., WNT6; 604663) signaling cascade is involved in regulation
of cytoskeletal rearrangements, apoptosis, and proliferation.
WNT-mediated simulation of 'frizzled' receptors (e.g., FZD2; 600667) can
activate the beta-catenin (CTNNB1; 116806) pathway, mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) cascades, and G protein-dependent pathways. The
signaling function of the WNT/frizzled pathway is antagonized by
secreted frizzled-related proteins (e.g. SFRP1; 604156), which bind to
either WNTs or frizzled receptors.

CLONING

Using differential display to compare uterine adenocarcinoma with normal
proliferative endometrium, followed by screening a uterine cDNA library
and 5-prime RACE, Abu Jawdeh et al. (1999) isolated a cDNA encoding
SFRP4, which they termed FRPHE. Sequence analysis predicted that the
346-amino acid SFRP4 protein contains an N-terminal signal peptide, no
transmembrane domain, and a hydrophilic C terminus. In situ
hybridization analysis demonstrated exclusive expression in stromal and
myometrial cells, particularly in endometrium and breast. Upregulated
expression was detected in endometrial and breast carcinomas. Northern
blot analysis revealed wide expression of 3.0- and 2.2-kb SFRP4
transcripts, and expression in endometrium correlated with phase of the
menstrual cycle. Expression was highest in late proliferative
endometrium. Function analysis in Xenopus embryos indicated that SFRP4
inhibited WNT8 (606360)-mediated development of secondary axes.
Abu-Jawdeh et al. (1999) proposed that SFRP4 may act in endometrium as a
modulator of WNT-mediated signaling to regulate adult uterine morphology
and function.

GENE FUNCTION

By RT-PCR analysis, Schumann et al. (2000) showed that expression of
SFRP1, SFRP2 (604157), and FZD2 was unchanged in failing myocardium
compared with nonfailing controls, whereas expression of SFRP3 (FRZB;
605083) and SFRP4 was elevated. In situ RT-PCR analysis detected
expression of SFRP3 and SFRP4 in cardiomyocytes. Western blot analysis
indicated that CTNNB1 expression was decreased in myocardium with high
SFRP3 and SFRP4 levels. Schumann et al. (2000) proposed that paracrine
WNT/frizzled signaling is inhibited by SFRPs in overloaded myocardium
and that this inhibition is associated with depletion of cytosolic
CTNNB1 and the induction of apoptosis susceptibility.

MAPPING

Rattner et al. (1997) mapped the mouse Sfrp4 gene to chromosome 13 in a
region showing homology of synteny to human chromosome 7p14-p13.

614169	TITLE *614169 NEUROBEACHIN-LIKE 2; NBEAL2
;;KIAA0540
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NBEAL2 belongs to the BEACH (beige and CHS1) domain-containing protein
family, which includes NBEAL1 (609816), neurobeachin (NBEA; 604889),
CHS1 (LYST; 606897), and LRBA (606453). NBEAL2 is predicted to have a
role in alpha-granule biogenesis in megakaryocytes (Gunay-Aygun et al.,
2011; Albers et al., 2011; Kahr et al., 2011).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned NBEAL2, which they designated
KIAA0540. The deduced 1,113-amino acid protein shares weak similarity
with human beige-like protein (BGL, or LRBA; 606453). RT-PCR analysis
detected variable NBEAL2 expression in all tissues examined. Expression
was highest in lung, kidney, and thymus, lowest in brain, spleen, and
testis, and intermediate in all other tissues.

By database analysis, Gunay-Aygun et al. (2011) identified 15 NBEAL2
mRNA transcripts, of which at least 7 are protein coding. The
full-length 2,754-amino acid NBEAL2 protein has an armadillo (ARM; see
611226)-type fold in its N-terminal half and a BEACH domain and WD40
repeats in its C-terminal half. RT-PCR detected variable expression of
most NBEAL2 transcripts in whole blood and in all hematopoietic cell
types examined, including megakaryocytes and platelets. Electron
microscopic analysis of fractionated normal human platelets revealed
colocalization of NBEAL2 with markers of the dense tubular system and
endoplasmic reticulum.

By database analysis, Albers et al. (2011) found that NBEAL2 was
expressed in hematopoietic cells, but not in adult or fetal brain. Among
8 blood lineages and platelets, NBEAL2 showed highest expression in
megakaryocytes and granulocytes, and it was upregulated during
megakaryopoiesis.

Kahr et al. (2011) stated that the 2,754-amino acid NBEAL2 protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 302.5 kD. In addition to the BEACH domain
and WD40 repeats, NBEAL2 has a concavalin A-like lectin domain and a
pleckstrin (PLEK; 173570) homology domain.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gunay-Aygun et al. (2011) determined that the NBEAL2 gene contains 54
exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the NBEAL2
gene to chromosome 3. By genomic sequence analysis, Gunay-Aygun et al.
(2011) mapped the NBEAL2 gene within the gray platelet syndrome (GPS;
139090) locus on chromosome 3p22.1-p21.1. Albers et al. (2011) and Kahr
et al. (2011) stated that the NBEAL2 gene maps to chromosome 3p21.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Simultaneously and independently, Gunay-Aygun et al. (2011), Albers et
al. (2011), and Kahr et al. (2011) identified biallelic mutations in the
NBEAL2 gene in patients with gray platelet syndrome (GPS; 139090), a
rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by mild to moderate
bleeding tendency, moderate thrombocytopenia, and a marked decrease or
absence of platelet alpha-granules and of the proteins contained in
alpha-granules. Using exome sequencing of the 3p21 locus, Gunay-Aygun et
al. (2011) identified homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in
the NBEAL2 gene (see, e.g., 614169.0001-614169.0003) in 15 unrelated
patients with the disorder who had been linked to the 3p21 locus
(Gunay-Aygun et al., 2010). There were 5 missense, 3 nonsense, 4
frameshift, and 3 splice site mutations. The mutations were not found in
629 control genomes or 100 control individuals. There were no apparent
genotype/phenotype correlations. Albers et al. (2011) also used exome
sequencing of the 3p21 locus to identify homozygous or compound
heterozygous NBEAL2 mutations (see, e.g., 614169.0003-614169.0005) in
affected members of 4 families with GPS. The mutations occurred
throughout the gene. Kahr et al. (2011) used platelet-derived mRNA to
identify the NBEAL2 gene as mutant in a patient with GPS. Sequencing of
the gene identified biallelic mutations (see, e.g., 614169.0006 and
614169.0007) in affected individuals of 3 families with the disorder.
One family was Pakistani, 1 was Native American, and a third was Native
American/Mexican. All the authors noted that NBEAL2 belongs to a family
of proteins involved in membrane dynamics and intracellular vesicle
trafficking. One such protein, LYST (606897), is mutant in
Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS; 214500), which is characterized by
defects in platelet granules and other lysosome-related organelles. The
findings indicated that NBEAL2 is critical for the development of
platelet alpha-granules.

ANIMAL MODEL

Albers et al. (2011) found that knockout of zebrafish Nbeal2 via
morpholino oligonucleotides resulted in spontaneous tail bleeding in 41%
of embryos. Morpholino knockdown resulted in complete abrogation of
thrombocytes, the zebrafish equivalent of platelets, whereas mature
erythrocytes were not affected.

GRAY PLATELET SYNDROME
NBEAL2, ARG901TER

In a Muslim Bedouin patient with gray platelet syndrome (GPS; 139090),
Gunay-Aygun et al. (2011) identified a homozygous 2701C-T transition in
exon 19 of the NBEAL2 gene, resulting in an arg901-to-ter (R901X)
substitution. The patient had moderate bleeding.

the NBEAL2 gene, resulting in a ser294-to-ter (S294X) substitution. The
patient had severe bleeding.

In a French patient with moderate bleeding due to gray platelet syndrome
(139090), Gunay-Aygun et al. (2011) identified a homozygous 1163T-C
transition in exon 11 of the NBEAL2 gene, resulting in a leu388-to-pro

Albers et al. (2011) identified a homozygous L388P mutation in a patient
with GPS.

gene: an A-to-T transversion resulting in a glu643-to-val (E643V)
substitution, and a C-to-T transition resulting in a pro2100-to-leu
(P2100L; 614169.0005) substitution in the BEACH domain. Both
substitutions occurred in highly conserved regions. The unaffected
mother was heterozygous for the E643V substitution, but DNA from the
father was unavailable.

the NBEAL2 gene, resulting in a trp607-to-ter (W607X) substitution. Two
sibs from a second family with the disorder were compound heterozygous
for W607X and a 1-bp duplication in exon 33 (5413dupG; 614169.0007). The

609709	TITLE *609709 GLYCOSYLTRANSFERASE-LIKE 1B; GYLTL1B
;;LIKE-GLYCOSYLTRANSFERASE 2;;
LARGE2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database searching, Fujimura et al. (2005) identified a sequence,
which they designated LARGE2, that showed homology to LARGE (603590), a
putative glycosyltransferase thought to be involved in the maturation of
alpha-dystroglycan (alpha-DG, DAG1; 128239). Fujimura et al. (2005)
identified and subsequently cloned the LARGE2 gene from human kidney
RNA. LARGE2 encodes a deduced 721-amino acid protein with a topology
typical of a type II membrane protein, and a DXD motif that is present
in many glycosyltransferases. The LARGE2 and LARGE proteins share 64.2%
sequence identity. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that LARGE2 and
LARGE are expressed almost ubiquitously. LARGE2 exhibits highest
expression in placenta, followed by pancreas, mammary gland, and kidney.
Unlike LARGE, which is expressed most highly in fetal brain, LARGE2 is
hardly detectable in the central nervous system.

GENE FUNCTION

Fujimura et al. (2005) coexpressed alpha-DG with LARGE and LARGE2 in
human embryonic kidney 3T3 cells and observed that LARGE2 supported the
maturation of alpha-DG more effectively than LARGE and exerted its
activity in addition to LARGE. Using deletion mutants of alpha-DG,
Fujimura et al. (2005) found that LARGE and/or LARGE2 facilitate the
functional glycosylation of the mucin-like domain of alpha-DG. In vitro
pull-down assays indicated that LARGE2 recognizes the N-terminal domain
of alpha-DG. Fujimura et al. (2005) suggested that LARGE and LARGE2 have
compensatory functions that can explain the residual functionally
glycosylated alpha-DG in a patient with a form of muscular dystrophy
(MDC1D; 608840) who had null LARGE alleles.

Brockington et al. (2005) showed that GYLTL1B and LARGE localized to the
Golgi apparatus and both stimulated alpha-dystroglycan
hyperglycosylation and increased its affinity for laminin binding. The
authors suggested that GYLTL1B may be a candidate gene for muscular
dystrophy, and that its overexpression could compensate for the
deficiency of both LARGE and other glycosyltransferases.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Fujimura et al. (2005) mapped the LARGE2 gene to
chromosome 11p11.2.

601929	TITLE *601929 ATPase, Ca(2+)-TRANSPORTING, UBIQUITOUS; ATP2A3
;;SARCOPLASMIC RETICULUM Ca(2+)-ATPase 3; SERCA3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPases (SERCAs), such as ATP2A3, are
membrane-spanning proteins that transport Ca(2+) across membranes
bordering Ca(2+)-sequestering stores, such as the sarcoplasmic or
endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Isoform diversity results by alternative
processing of the primary gene transcripts in a developmentally
modulated or tissue-specific manner.

CLONING

Dode et al. (1996) isolated cDNA and genomic clones of human SERCA3. The
deduced 109,237-Da protein contains 999 amino acids and is 94% similar
to rat SERCA3. Northern blot analysis provided evidence for alternative
processing of the SERCA3 transcript.

By RT-PCR, Santiago-Garcia et al. (1996) found variable expression of
the PMCA (see 108731) and SERCA genes during human fetal heart
development. SERCA3 was expressed at relatively constant levels at all
stages of fetal heart development examined and in adult heart and
placenta.

Poch et al. (1998) cloned 2 SERCA3 splice variants from a kidney cDNA
library and a Jurkat T-cell line cDNA library. The deduced proteins,
which contain 999 and 1,029 amino acids, both have 10 transmembrane
domains but differ at their C termini. They also cloned a third variant
encoding a 998-amino acid protein that differs from the 999-amino acid
protein at 3 amino acids; however, the origin of this variant was
unclear. Northern blot analysis detected a major transcript of about 5
kb expressed at highest levels in thymus, colon, pancreas, and spleen.
Intermediate to low expression was detected in all other tissues
examined. The SERCA3 proteins localized in the nuclear envelope and in
the ER throughout human embryonic kidney and Jurkat T-cell lines.

Dode et al. (1998) identified 3 SERCA3 splice variants that encode
proteins with 999, 1,043, and 1,024 amino acids. The proteins, which the
authors designated SERCA3a, SERCA3b, and SERCA3c, respectively, differ
only in their C termini. Mouse Serca3 is also expressed as 3 variants of
similar size.

By RT-PCR of human platelets, Martin et al. (2002) identified and cloned
2 additional SERCA3 splice variants, which they designated SERCA3d and
SERCA3e. The deduced proteins contain 1,044 and 1,052 amino acids,
respectively, and differ from each other and the previously identified
SERCA3 isoforms only in their C termini. RT-PCR detected all 5 SERCA3
splice variants in platelets, lung, and pancreas. Heart, brain,
placenta, and kidney expressed 3 or 4 splice variants, and skeletal
muscle expressed only 1 variant. Variation was also found in the
expression of SERCA3 variants in established cell lines.

Bobe et al. (2004) identified a sixth SERCA3 variant, which they
designated SERCA3f, that lacks exon 21 but retains exon 22. The deduced
SERCA3f protein contains 1,033-amino acids and differs from the other
SERCA3 isoforms at the C terminus. RT-PCR detected SERCA3f expression in
all tissues and cell lines examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Following isolation of the microsome fraction of transfected human
embryonic kidney cells, Poch et al. (1998) demonstrated that proteins
encoded by 2 SERCA3 splice variants supported Ca(2+) uptake and ATPase
activity.

Martin et al. (2002) found that all 5 SERCA3 isoforms pumped Ca(2+) with
similar affinities, and all pumped Ca(2+) toward the ER. However, the
isoforms modulated cytosolic Ca(2+) concentrations and ER Ca(2+)
concentrations differently. Martin et al. (2002) concluded that the
SERCA3 isoforms have widespread roles in cellular Ca(2+) signaling.

Gelebart et al. (2002) found that expression of SERCA3 was significantly
reduced or lost in colon carcinomas compared with normal colonic
epithelial cells. Treatment of tumor cells with butyrate or other
differentiation inducers resulted in increased SERCA3 expression,
whereas SERCA2 (ATP2A2; 108740) expression was unaltered or was reduced.
SERCA3 expression was increased along with other differentiation markers
during spontaneous post-confluence differentiation of a colon carcinoma
cell line.

Because the SERCA3b and SERCA3f isoforms diverge at the beginning of the
C-terminal domain but share the same last 21 amino acids, Bobe et al.
(2004) investigated the relationship between structure, function, and
location of these isoforms. Immunofluorescence and/or confocal
microscopy showed that SERCA3f and SERCA3b localized in overlapping but
distinct ER locations. By transfection in human embryonic kidney cells,
Bobe et al. (2004) found that SERCA3b and SERCA3f created distinct
resting cytosolic Ca(2+) concentrations and ER Ca(2+) content. SERCA3b
and SERCA3f showed similar sensitivity to a SERCA inhibitor and similar
kinetics of Ca(2+) release and reuptake. They both demonstrated low
apparent Ca(2+) affinity and enhanced rates of dephosphorylation of the
phosphoenzyme intermediate relative to other SERCA Ca(2+) channels.

GENE STRUCTURE

Dode et al. (1998) determined that the ATP2A3 gene contains 22 exons and
spans more than 50 kb. Exon 21 is subject to alternative splicing and
may be included, partially included, or excluded. The promoter region
has no TATA box, but it has 14 putative Sp1 (189906) sites, 11 CACCC
boxes, 5 AP2 (107580)-binding motifs, 3 GGCTGGGG motifs, 3 CANNTG boxes,
a GATA (see 305371) site, and single sites for ETS1 (164720), MYC
(190080), and TFIIIC (see 603246). The authors showed that the GC-rich
region was critical for SERCA3 transcription in Jurkat cells.

Martin et al. (2002) identified a novel exon within what was previously
reported as the last intron of ATP2A3, indicating that the ATP2A3 gene
contains 23 exons.

MAPPING

Dode et al. (1996) assigned the ATP2A3 gene to human chromosome 17p13.3
by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

ANIMAL MODEL

Liu et al. (1997) found that Serca3-null mice were viable, fertile, and
did not exhibit an overt disease phenotype. However, mutant aortic ring
preparations showed diminished acetylcholine-induced intracellular
Ca(2+) signaling and relaxation, with reduced Ca(2+) transient and
nitric oxide production. Their response to other modifiers of vascular
tone was unaltered. Liu et al. (1997) concluded that SERCA3 plays a role
in Ca(2+) signaling mechanisms that mediate endothelium-dependent
relaxation of vascular smooth muscle.

Serca3 expression is restricted to beta cells in mouse pancreas.
Arredouani et al. (2002) found the Serca3 ablation was insufficient in
itself to alter glucose homeostasis or impair insulin secretion in mice.
However, Serca3 ablation altered the reuptake of Ca(2+) into the ER and
increased the insulin response of islets to glucose.

DESCRIPTION For background information on the LIM gene family, see LHX1 (601999).

CLONING

By screening a human fetal brain cDNA library with mouse Lhx5 PCR
primers, Zhao et al. (2000) identified the human homolog, LHX5. The LHX5
gene encodes a predicted 402-amino acid protein containing 2 LIM domains
and a homeodomain. LHX5 shares 98.8% amino acid identity with the mouse
Lhx5 gene product. Using RT-PCR, Zhao et al. (2000) detected LHX5
expression in fetal brain as well as in various regions of the adult
central nervous system including spinal cord, cerebellum, and thalamus.
Using in situ hybridization, Sheng et al. (1997) detected Lhx5 mRNA
expression in the developing central nervous system of mouse embryos and
concluded that the expression pattern suggested a regulatory function in
forebrain formation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhao et al. (2000) determined that the LHX5 gene contains 5 exons.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Zhao et al. (2000) mapped the
LHX5 gene to chromosome 12q24.31-q24.32.

ANIMAL MODEL

Zhao et al. (1999) generated mice lacking functional Lhx5. Although most
of the homozygous Lhx5 mutant mice died a few days after birth, some
survived to adulthood. Histologic analysis of the surviving homozygous
mutant mice revealed a defect in hippocampal development. Hippocampal
neural precursor cells were specified and proliferated, but many of them
failed either to exit the cell cycle or to differentiate and migrate
properly. Zhao et al. (1999) concluded that Lhx5 is essential for the
regulation of precursor cell proliferation and for the control of
neuronal differentiation and migration during hippocampal development.

MUTED, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; MUTED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The muted (mu) mouse is a model for Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome (HPS;
203300). Mice with mutations in the muted gene have light eyes at birth
and fur of a muted brown shade.

CLONING

Zhang et al. (2002) identified and cloned the mouse muted gene.
Full-length muted cDNA encodes a deduced 185-amino acid protein.
Northern blot analysis revealed ubiquitous expression of a 1.8-kb
transcript in normal mice, with higher levels in brain, bone marrow,
kidney, and liver and lower levels in skeletal muscle. By transfection
of mouse melanocytes with epitope-tagged muted constructs, Zhang et al.
(2002) found muted protein in vesicles distributed throughout the cell
body and dendrites. Comparison with bright field images established that
the vesicles were not coincident with melanosomes. Transfected COS-7
cells exhibited a similar vesicular pattern throughout the cell body.

Zhang et al. (2002) cloned the human muted gene by RT-PCR, 5-prime RACE,
and 3-prime RACE of human placenta mRNA. The deduced protein has 187
amino acids and contains a possible vacuolar targeting motif (TLPK) that
is absent from the mouse sequence. The mouse and human proteins share
76% sequence identity.

By Western blot analysis of wildtype mouse fibroblasts, Falcon-Perez et
al. (2002) detected expression of a 23-kD muted protein.

GENE FUNCTION

By coimmunoprecipitation and immunodepletion experiments of mouse skin
fibroblasts, Falcon-Perez et al. (2002) identified muted as a component
of BLOC1 (biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex-1), which
also contains pallidin (PLDN; 604310). A yeast 2-hybrid screen found no
direct interaction between muted and pallidin, but pallidin was found to
interact with itself.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhang et al. (2002) determined that the mouse muted gene contains 5
exons and spans 52 kb. The genomic structure of the human muted gene is
similar.

MAPPING

Zhang et al. (2002) mapped the mouse muted gene to a segment of
chromosome 13 that shows homology of synteny to human chromosome
6p24-p23. By genomic sequence analysis, they mapped the human gene to
chromosome 6p25.1-p24.3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Zhang et al. (2002) noted that 'muted' (mu) mice show hypopigmentation,
hemorrhaging, and early death due to lung abnormalities. Ultrastructural
examination revealed that the eyes of adult muted mice had reduced total
number of melanosomes within the retinal pigment epithelium and
significantly reduced number within the choroid. Northern blot analysis
revealed a lack of muted transcript in tissues obtained from muted mice;
intermediate amounts of transcript were detected in heterozygous mice.
Zhang et al. (2002) determined that expression of muted was abrogated in
a mutant allele containing an insertion of an early transposon (ETn)
retrotransposon. Expression was likewise lost in the muted(J) allele,
which has a 1-bp deletion within the coding region. The mu mouse is a
model for Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS; see 203300). The mu gene
encodes a ubiquitously expressed transcript, specifying a predicted
185-amino acid protein, whose expression is abrogated in the mu allele
by insertion of an early transposon (ETn) retrotransposon. Mu mice
demonstrated structurally aberrant melanosomes in the eyes; the muted
protein was localized by immunofluorescence within vesicles of the cell
body and dendrites of transfected melanocytes, suggesting a role of the
mu gene in vesicle trafficking. The mu gene was present only in mice and
humans among analyzed genomes, and BACs containing the human homolog
were previously localized to chromosome 6p24.3-p25.1. The authors
concluded that the mu gene is a member of a novel gene set found among
higher eukaryotes which regulates the synthesis/function of highly
specialized subcellular organelles such as melanosomes and platelet
dense granules.

Falcon-Perez et al. (2002) detected no muted protein in fibroblasts from
muted mice.

607096	TITLE *607096 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 22 (URATE TRANSPORTER), MEMBER 12; SLC22A12
;;ORGANIC ANION TRANSPORTER 4-LIKE; OAT4L;;
URATE TRANSPORTER 1; URAT1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The SLC22A12 gene encodes URAT1, a renal urate-anion exchanger that
regulates blood urate levels.

CLONING

Enomoto et al. (2002) isolated a SLC22A12 cDNA from a human kidney cDNA
library. The cDNA, which they called URAT1 for 'urate transporter-1,'
corresponds to a gene of 2,642 basepairs encoding a protein of 555 amino
acids that is 42% identical to OAT4 (SLC22A11; 607097). The hydropathy
plot predicts 12 membrane-spanning domains in URAT1, which are similar
to those in members of the OAT family. URAT1 has 3 consensus sequences
for N-glycosylation and 2 cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase
phosphorylation sites. High stringency Northern analysis revealed
predominant expression of URAT1 mRNA in the human adult and fetal
kidney, and immunohistochemical analysis revealed that URAT1 protein is
prominent in epithelial cells of the proximal tubule of the renal
cortex. Under high magnification, the protein was found to be located in
the luminal membrane of the epithelium of proximal tubules but not in
that of distal tubules.

GENE FUNCTION

Enomoto et al. (2002) demonstrated that Xenopus oocytes injected with
URAT1 cRNA exhibited time-dependent transport activity of [14C]urate but
not of various typical substrates of OATs or organic cation
transporters. URAT1 was found to be a cotransporter with anions, in
particular chloride, bromide, or iodine, but not fluoride. Enomoto et
al. (2002) found that urate transport via URAT1 is inhibited selectively
by organic anions such as lactate, nicotinate, acetoacetate,
hydroxybutyrate, and succinate. Para-aminohippurate (PAH), the
representative substrate of OATs, did not exert an inhibitory effect on
urate uptake via URAT1, consistent with the observation that PAH has no
effect on the fractional excretion of urate in humans. Benzbromarone,
probenecid, phenylbutazone, sulfinpyrazone, nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory drugs, and diuretics inhibited urate uptake.
Trans-stimulation experiments indicated that the major counteranions
that exchange for urate via URAT1 are organic anions rather than
inorganic chloride.

Thangaraju et al. (2006) found the urinary excretion of urate was
significantly elevated in Cebpd (116898) -/- mice, although expression
of Urat1 was unaltered. However, expression of the Na(+)/lactate
cotransporters Slc5a8 (608044) and Slc5a12 (612455) was almost
completely ablated in Cebpd -/- mice. Thangaraju et al. (2006) proposed
that lactate reabsorption by SLC5A8 and SLC5A12 is coupled to urate
reabsorption by URAT1 at the proximal tubule apical membrane.

MAPPING

Enomoto et al. (2002) identified a sequence representing the SLC22A12
gene within a BAC clone (GenBank GENBANK AC044790) mapping to chromosome
11q13, near the SLC22A11 gene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In patients with renal hypouricemia (220150), Enomoto et al. (2002) and
Tanaka et al. (2003) identified mutations in the SLC22A12 gene
(607096.0001-607096.0003).

Ichida et al. (2008) identified SLC22A12 mutations in 66 of 71 71
Japanese patients with hypouricemia. The W258X mutation (607096.0001)
was by far the most common mutation, occurring in 93 alleles, including
31 homozygotes and 23 compound heterozygotes. A total of 13 mutations,
including 3 novel mutations, were identified (see, e.g. 607096.0005;
607096.0006). Acute renal failure and urolithiasis occurred in 21.1% and
8.5% of patients, respectively. Three patients had chronic renal
failure. By haplotype analysis, Ichida et al. (2008) found that W258X
was a founder mutation with an estimated age of 6,820 years.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPOURICEMIA, RENAL, 1
SLC22A12, TRP258TER

In a 48-year-old male with idiopathic renal hypouricemia (220150),
Enomoto et al. (2002) identified a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 774
within exon 4 of the SLC22A12 gene, resulting in a tryptophan-to-stop
substitution at codon 258 (W258X). This mutation was found in
homozygosity and was not identified in 180 randomly chosen control
Japanese individuals.

In 2 brothers with hereditary renal hypouricemia and exercise-induced
acute renal failure, Tanaka et al. (2003) identified homozygosity for
the W258X mutation. The parents of the sibs and all of the sibs' 5
children were heterozygous for the mutation.

By haplotype analysis of 31 Japanese individuals homozygous for the
W258X mutation, Ichida et al. (2008) estimated that the mutation is
about 6,820 years old. This mutation dates back from between the time
when the Jomon people predominated in Japan and the time when the Yayoi
people started to migrate to Japan from the Korean peninsula.

.0002
HYPOURICEMIA, RENAL, 1
SLC22A12, THR217MET

In a patient with idiopathic renal hypouricemia (220150), Enomoto et al.
(2002) identified a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 650 in exon 3 of the
SLC22A12 gene, resulting in a threonine-to-methionine substitution at
codon 217 (T217M). This mutation was found in homozygosity and was not
identified in any of 180 randomly chosen control Japanese individuals.

.0003
HYPOURICEMIA, RENAL, 1
SLC22A12, GLU298ASP

In a patient with idiopathic renal hypouricemia (220150), Enomoto et al.
(2002) identified a G-to-T transversion at nucleotide 894 in exon 5 of
the SLC22A12 gene, resulting in a glutamic acid-to-aspartic acid
substitution at codon 298 (E298D). This mutation was found in
homozygosity and was not identified in any of 180 randomly chosen
control Japanese individuals.

.0004
HYPOURICEMIA, RENAL, 1
SLC22A12, LEU418ARG

In the affected member of a Japanese family with renal hypouricemia
(220150), Wakida et al. (2005) detected compound heterozygosity for
W258X (607096.0001) and for a novel mutation, a 1253T-G transversion in
the SLC22A12 gene that resulted in a leu418-to-arg (L418R) substitution
in the tenth transmembrane domain of the protein. The L418R mutation had
significantly reduced urate-transporting activities compared with
wildtype (P less than 0.05), suggesting that it is a loss-of-function
mutation.

.0005
HYPOURICEMIA, RENAL, 1
SLC22A12, ARG90HIS

In a Japanese man with renal hypouricemia (220150), Ichida et al. (2008)
identified a homozygous 269G-A transition in the SLC22A12 gene,
resulting in an arg90-to-his (R90H) substitution. Nine additional
affected individuals were compound heterozygous for R90H and W258X
(607096.0001).

.0006
HYPOURICEMIA, RENAL, 1
SLC22A12, GLY361VAL

In 2 unrelated Japanese individuals with renal hypouricemia (220150),
Ichida et al. (2008) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations
in the SLC22A12 gene: a 1082G-T transversion resulting in a
gly361-to-val (G361V) substitution, and W258X (607096.0001). In vitro
functional expression assays showed that the G361V-mutant protein had
decreased uric acid transport activity.

600076	TITLE *600076 TENSIN 1; TNS1
;;TENSIN; TNS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Tensin is an actin-binding protein that is concentrated in some
submembranous cytoskeletal focal contacts (Weigt et al., 1992). In
addition to its 3 actin-binding domains, the 200-kD tensin protein
contains an Src homology 2 (SH2) motif that mediates protein-protein
contacts and is shared by a variety of signal transduction molecules. In
addition, tensin can bind to phosphotyrosine-containing proteins and can
itself be phosphorylated, suggesting that tensin may be a link between
the cytoskeleton and a signal transduction pathway. Tensin
phosphorylation occurs during cell adhesion to extracellular matrix
proteins.

CLONING

Using avian tensin as probe, Chen et al. (2000) obtained overlapping
clones of tensin from human heart and bovine pericyte cDNA libraries.
The deduced 1,735-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of
185 kD. Human and bovine tensins share 82% amino acid identity. In
addition to the actin-binding domains and SH2 domain, tensin contains a
region similar to PTEN (601728) and a 9-amino acid sequence that is
repeated 4 times. Northern blot analysis revealed a major 10-kb
transcript expressed in most tissues, with highest levels in heart,
skeletal muscle, kidney, and lung. Heart and skeletal muscle also
expressed a 9-kb transcript. Western blot analysis revealed an apparent
molecular mass of 220 kD, and mutation analysis revealed that the
discrepancy between the calculated and the apparent molecular masses was
due to the reduced electrophoretic mobility of the central region of the
tensin polypeptide. Expression of tensin in mouse fibroblasts resulted
in staining at focal adhesions.

GENE FUNCTION

Katz et al. (2000) presented evidence that overexpression of mammalian
tensin activates both the JNK (601158) and p38 MAPK (600289) pathways.
Tensin-mediated JNK activation was independent of the activities of Rac
(602048) and Cdc42 (116952), but did depend on Sek (601335).

Chen et al. (2002) determined that stable overexpression of both
tensin-1 and -2 (TENC1; 607717) in HEK293 cells promoted cell migration
on fibronectin (135600) in a cell migration assay. Fibroblasts from
tensin-1-null mice migrated significantly slower than their normal
counterparts in the cell migration assay, and tensin-2 expression was
not upregulated to compensate for loss of tensin-1 function.

Chen et al. (2000) found that tensin expression was reduced or absent in
several prostate and breast cancer cell lines, while the levels of talin
(186745) and focal adhesion kinase (600758) remained at normal levels.
They also found that tensin is a substrate for a focal adhesion
protease, calpain II (114230), and that incubation of cells with a
calpain inhibitor prevented tensin cleavage and induced morphologic
change. Chen et al. (2002) hypothesized that cleavage of tensin and
other focal adhesion constituents by calpain disrupts maintenance of
normal cell shape.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chen et al. (2002) determined that the tensin gene contains 33 exons and
spans about 150 kb. Exon 6 contains the putative start codon.

MAPPING

Jankowski and Gumucio (1995) demonstrated that, in the mouse, genes for
tensin, villin (193040), and desmin (125660) are closely linked on
chromosome 1. This region is homologous to human chromosome 2; in the
human, the desmin gene maps to 2q35 and the villin-1 gene to 2q35-q36.
Jankowski and Gumucio (1995) used a rat DNA probe to study human/rodent
somatic cell hybrids and obtained results consistent with location of
the human TNS gene on chromosome 2. Homology of synteny would suggest
that it is located in the 2q35-q36 region.

ANIMAL MODEL

Lo et al. (1997) generated tensin-null mice. These mice appeared normal
and healthy for several months, but eventually developed cystic kidneys.
Progressive cyst formation led to kidney degeneration and death from
renal failure. The authors concluded that tensin is not necessary for
mouse embryogenesis, but it is required for the maintenance of normal
renal function.
