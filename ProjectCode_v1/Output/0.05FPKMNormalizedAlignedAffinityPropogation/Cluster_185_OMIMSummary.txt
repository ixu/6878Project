DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

GPCR41 (607882) and GPCR42 act as receptors for porcine endogenous
retrovirus subgroup A (PERV-A).

The water-soluble vitamin riboflavin is converted to the coenzymes
flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), and
is essential for normal cellular functions. SLC52A1, or RFT1, is a
transmembrane protein that mediates cellular uptake of riboflavin
(summary by Yao et al., 2010).

CLONING

By database screening for homologs of GPCR41, Ericsson et al. (2003)
identified GPCR42, which they designated PAR2. They cloned full-length
PAR2 from a 293-cell cDNA library. The deduced 448-amino acid protein is
a putative G protein-coupled receptor and contains 10 or 11 putative
transmembrane regions similar to other gammaretrovirus receptors. PAR2
shares significant homology with PAR1 and with PAR proteins from baboon,
pig, and mouse. Northern blot analysis using a probe that did not
differentiate between PAR1 and PAR2 detected expression in all tissues
examined, with the possible exception of bladder. Highest expression was
in testis. RT-PCR detected PAR1 and PAR2 expression in peripheral blood
mononuclear cells of 11 healthy volunteers. Confocal microscopy detected
expression of fluorescence-tagged PAR2 at the plasma membrane and in the
perinuclear region of transfected rabbit corneal fibroblasts.

Using real-time PCR, Yao et al. (2010) detected highly specific RFT1
expression in placenta. Much lower expression was detected in small
intestine, thymus, and trachea, with little to none in other tissues
examined. Fluorescence-tagged RFT1 was expressed in the plasma membrane
of transfected HEK293 cells.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Ericsson et al. (2003) mapped the GPR172B
gene to chromosome 17.

Hartz (2012) mapped the SLC52A1 gene to chromosome 17p13.2 based on an
alignment of the SLC52A1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK000922) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

Ericsson et al. (2003) determined that expression of PAR1 or PAR2 in
transfected rabbit corneal fibroblasts and mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts
mediated both the entry and the productive replication of PERV-A.
Expression of PAR1 and PAR2 did not alter the sensitivity of the rabbit
cells to PERV-B or -C. The results suggested that PAR2 may mediate a
higher level of PERV infection than PAR1. Ericsson et al. (2003) noted
that the presence of these PERV-A receptors highlights a risk faced by
xenotransplant recipients.

Using transfected HEK293 cells, Yao et al. (2010) showed that RFT1, RFT2
(SLC52A3; 613350), and RFT3 (SLC52A2; 607882) mediated uptake of
radiolabeled riboflavin in a time- and concentration-dependent manner.
All 3 transporters also mediated riboflavin uptake independent of
extracellular Na+ and Cl-. RFT2, but not RFT1 or RFT3, showed reduced
riboflavin uptake when extracellular pH was increased from 5.4 to 8.4.
For all 3, radiolabeled riboflavin transport was completely inhibited by
excess unlabeled riboflavin and lumiflavine, and modestly inhibited by
FMN. FAD slightly but significantly inhibited RFT3-mediated riboflavin
uptake. Little to no effect was observed with other riboflavin analogs,
D-ribose, organic ions, or other vitamins.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a woman with riboflavin deficiency (RBFVD; 615026) who had an infant
with transient neonatal riboflavin deficiency (Chiong et al., 2007), Ho
et al. (2011) identified a de novo heterozygous 1.9-kb deletion within
the SLC52A1 gene (607883.0001), predicted to result in
haploinsufficiency. The infant did not carry the deletion. These
findings confirmed that the transient clinical and metabolic
abnormalities in the infant were the result of maternal riboflavin
deficiency.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RIBOFLAVIN DEFICIENCY
SLC52A1, 1.9-KB DEL

In a woman with riboflavin deficiency (RBFVD; 615026), Ho et al. (2011)
identified a de novo heterozygous 1.9-kb deletion in the SLC52A1 gene,
resulting in the deletion of exons 2 and 3 and predicted to cause
haploinsufficiency. The woman was clinically asymptomatic, but showed
biochemical evidence of riboflavin deficiency, manifest as increased
serum acylcarnitines. She was originally ascertained (Chiong et al.,
2007) after her newborn daughter presented soon after birth with poor
suck, hypoglycemia, and metabolic acidosis. The child had dicarboxylic
aciduria and elevated plasma acylcarnitine levels, initially thought to
be consistent with multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD;
231680). Treatment with oral riboflavin resulted in complete resolution
of the clinical and biochemical findings. The findings were consistent
with transient neonatal riboflavin deficiency secondary to maternal
riboflavin deficiency that was exacerbated during pregnancy. The infant
did not carry the deletion.

615178	TITLE *615178 KXDL MOTIF-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; KXD1
;;CHROMOSOME 19 OPEN READING FRAME 50; C19ORF50
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Based on experiments in mice and Drosophila, KXD1 is predicted to have a
role in biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles (Yang et al., 2012).

CLONING

By database analysis, Yang et al. (2012) identified human KXD1 and 2
splice variants of mouse Kxd1, which they termed Kxd1a and Kxd1b. The
deduced 177-amino acid mouse Kxd1a protein has a calculated molecular
mass of 20 kD and shares 93% amino acid identity with human KXD1. Kxd1a
is predicted to have 2 coiled-coil regions, the second of which contains
the KxDL motif. Kxd1b encodes a deduced 219-amino acid protein with an
N-terminal extension compared with Kxd1a. Western blot analysis detected
a single Kxdl1 protein that was expressed at variable levels in all
mouse tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Using protein interaction assays, Yang et al. (2012) showed that mouse
Kxd1 interacted with BLOS1 (BLOC1S1; 601444) and all other subunits of
biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex-1 (BLOC1) examined.
Knockdown of BLOS1 in HeLa cells via small interfering RNA reduced KXD1
protein content.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the KXD1 gene to chromosome 19p13.11 based on an
alignment of the KXD1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK098346) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

ANIMAL MODEL

Yang et al. (2012) found that Kxd1 -/- mice had a mild phenotype that
included reduction in dense granule content in platelets and
malformation of melanosomes in retinal pigment epithelia. The retinal
defect was associated with significantly reduced eumelanin content.
Knockout of Kxd1 reduced the steady-state level of Blos1, whereas the
levels of the BLOC1 subunits dysbindin (DTNBP1; 607145) and pallidin
(BLOC1S6; 604310) were unaffected. Likewise, Kxd1 content was not
altered in the BLOC1 mouse mutants sandy (DTNBP1), muted (BLOC1S5;
607289), and pallid (BLOC1S6).

610289	TITLE *610289 3-@OXOACID CoA TRANSFERASE 2; OXCT2
;;SCOT-T;;
FLJ00030
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

OXCT2 is a testis-specific succinyl-CoA:3-oxoacid CoA transferase (EC
2.8.3.5), which catalyzes the reversible transfer of CoA from
succinyl-CoA to acetoacetate in the first step of ketone body
utilization. See also OXCT1 (601424).

CLONING

Using mouse Oxct2 cDNA as a probe to screen a human testis cDNA library,
Tanaka et al. (2001) cloned OXCT2, which they called SCOT-T. The deduced
517-amino acid protein contains a predicted hydrophilic bridge region
and a conserved active site glutamate in common with OXCT1. OXCT2 shares
75.8% and 74.6% amino acid identity with mouse Oxct2 and human OXCT1,
respectively. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.8-kb transcript
expressed exclusively in testis. Using Western blot analysis and
indirect immunofluorescence staining of spermatozoa, Tanaka et al.
(2001) detected OXCT2 protein in testis and spermatozoa, where it
localized specifically to the midpiece of sperm flagellum.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tanaka et al. (2001) determined that the OXCT2 gene lacks an intron, and
they identified a nearby nonfunctional pseudogene in which nucleotides
745-762 and 778 are deleted. The entire OXCT2 transcription unit is
located within an intron of the BMP8 gene (602284).

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Tanaka et al. (2001) mapped the OXCT2 gene to
chromosome 1p35.3-p34.1.

607998	TITLE *607998 TRIPEPTIDYL PEPTIDASE I; TPP1
;;TPP I;;
CLN2 GENE; CLN2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TPP1 (EC 3.4.14.9) is a lysosomal exopeptidase that sequentially removes
tripeptides from the N termini of proteins. It also has a minor
endoprotease activity (Golabek et al., 2005).

CLONING

Sleat et al. (1997) used an approach applicable to other lysosomal
storage diseases to identify the molecular basis of 'late infantile
neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis' (LINCL, or CLN2; 204500). By purifying
mannose 6-phosphate-containing glycoproteins, which are present on newly
synthesized lysosomal enzymes, from normal brain by affinity
chromatography and fractionation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis, they identified a single protein absent in CLN2
specimens. Comparisons with EST databases resulted in the assembly of a
nearly complete sequence for the human CLN2 gene. Northern blot analysis
showed 2 transcripts, and mRNA was detected in all tissues examined with
highest levels in heart and placenta. The CLN2 transcript encodes a
563-residue protein with a molecular mass of 46 kD. Sequence comparisons
suggested that this protein is a pepstatin-insensitive lysosomal
peptidase.

Liu et al. (1998) reported the complete sequence of the CLN2 gene.

Golabek et al. (2003) stated that TPP1 encodes a 563-amino acid
preproenzyme with a 19-amino acid signal peptide and a 176-amino acid
prodomain that are removed during maturation, yielding a 368-amino acid
mature enzyme. TPP1 also contains 5 N-glycosylation sites. The proenzyme
has an apparent molecular mass of 66 kD, and the mature enzyme has an
apparent molecular mass of 46 to 48 kD.

GENE STRUCTURE

Liu et al. (1998) determined that the CLN2 gene contains 13 exons and
spans 6.65 kb.

MAPPING

By genomewide analysis, Haines et al. (1998) mapped the CLN2 gene to
chromosome 11p15.5.

GENE FUNCTION

Using immunostaining and confocal microscopy, Golabek et al. (2003)
found that TPP1 was present in lysosomes of Chinese hamster ovary cells
expressing human TPP1, similar to the endogenous enzyme in human cells.
Immunoblot analysis of cell lysates revealed a 68-kD precursor that was
converted to a mature 48-kD enzyme. Compounds affecting the pH of
intracellular acidic compartments and those interfering with
intracellular vesicular transport, as well as inhibition of fusion
between late endosomes and lysosomes, hampered conversion of TPP1
proenzyme into the mature form, suggesting that this process takes place
in lysosomes. Digestion of immunoprecipitated TPP1 with glycosidases or
chemical inhibition of N-glycosylation in cells reduced the molecular
mass of TPP1 proenzyme by about 10 kD, indicating that all 5
N-glycosylation sites of TPP1 are used. Further analysis showed that a
serine protease sensitive to the inhibitor AEBSF participated in
processing the TPP1 proenzyme to the mature form in vivo.

TPP1 proenzyme autoactivates in vitro via an unimolecular mechanism.
Golabek et al. (2005) found that high ionic strength and
glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) increased yield (ionic strength) or yield and
rate (GAGs) of TPP1 activation, enhanced degradation of liberated TPP1
prosegment fragments, and increased the pH of autoactivation up to 6.0.
Although ionic strength and GAGs also inhibited TPP1 activity in vitro
and in living cells, the degree of inhibition (from 20 to 60%) appeared
to be of limited functional significance. Binding of TPP1 to GAGs
improved its thermal stability and protected the enzyme against alkaline
pH-induced denaturation in vitro and in vivo. Golabek et al. (2005)
concluded that TPP1 can be autoactivated in vivo at lysosomal pH and
that GAGs can regulate this process.

Oyama et al. (2005) purified recombinant human TPP1 from
virus-TPP1-infected silkworm pupae and found that it had been processed
to the mature enzyme. Using a synthetic substrate, they showed that
mature TPP1 was stable in a pH range of 2.5 to 5.0, with an optimum pH
for activity of 4.0; activity was lost above pH 7. Oyama et al. (2005)
identified ser280, glu77, and asp81 (numbering of the mature enzyme) as
catalytic residues by mutational analysis, inhibition studies, and
sequence similarity with other family members.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In patients with late-infantile onset of CLN2 (204500), Sleat et al.
(1997) identified mutations in the CLN2 gene (607998.0001-607998.0004).

In 2 unrelated patients, originally diagnosed with juvenile-onset CLN3
(204200) on the basis of age at onset, age at death, and inclusion
morphology, Sleat et al. (1999) identified a rare monoallelic mutation
that resulted in an arg447-to-his (R447H) substitution in the CLN2 gene
(607998.0005).

Defects in the CLN2 gene do not appear to be responsible for adult NCL
(CLN4; 204300), or Kufs disease, as CLN2 protease activities are the
same as or higher than controls in adult NCL lymphoblasts (Sohar et al.,
1999).

Mole et al. (1999) tabulated the reported mutations and polymorphisms in
the CLN genes. The largest number of mutations, 26, had been identified
in the CLN2 gene.

Moore et al. (2008) identified 5 different mutations in the CLN2 gene
(see, e.g., 607998.0007) in affected members of 18 CLN2 families from
Newfoundland. Among a total of 28 CLN families in this population, CLN2
showed the highest incidence of 1 in 11,161 live births.

Walus et al. (2010) expressed 14 disease-associated missense TPP1
mutations (see, e.g., C365R, 607998.0001; R447H, 607998.0005; R206C,
607998.0006; G284V, 607998.0007; N286S, 607998.0008), into Chinese
hamster ovary cells. Most variants showed folding abnormalities,
resulting in obstructed transport to the lysosomes, prolonged half-life
of the proenzyme, and significantly reduced or no enzymatic activity.
Many of the mutant proteins were retained in the ER. The routes of
removal of misfolded proteins by the cells varied, ranging from
efficient degradation by the ubiquitin/proteasome system to abundant
secretion. Two TPPI variants (V277M and R447H) demonstrated enhanced
processing in response to folding improvement with molecular chaperones,
and R447H showed a 5-fold increase in activity under permissive
temperature conditions, suggesting that folding improvement strategies
may ameliorate the function of some misfolding TPPI mutant proteins.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Bessa et al. (2008) reported a 40-year-old Portuguese man with a mild
protracted form of CLN2 who was homozygous for a mutation that created a
potential acceptor site in intron 7 of the TPP1 gene (IVS7AS-10A-G;
607998.0009), predicted to result in a protein with 3 extra amino acids
between codons 295 and 296 and not affecting the wildtype splice site.
The patient had onset at age 10 years of progressive cognitive and motor
dysfunction and seizures. Western blot analysis detected a 60% reduction
in overall TPP1 protein levels, suggesting that the mutant protein had
decreased stability. Bessa et al. (2008) concluded that the mutant
protein retained enzyme activity, which was consistent with the milder
phenotype.

TPP1, CYS365ARG

In 2 unrelated patients with late-infantile onset of CLN2 (204500),
Sleat et al. (1997) identified a mutation in the CLN2 gene. In 1
patient, a monoallelic T-C transition resulted in a cys365-to-arg
substitution (C365R); presumably, the defect in this patient was
compound heterozygous and there was an additional, unidentified
mutation. In the second patient, a homozygous G-A transition in the same
codon resulted in a cys365-to-tyr (C365Y) amino acid substitution
(607998.0002) in the protein expressed from both alleles. Since this
cysteine proved to be involved in disulfide bonding, Sleat et al. (1997)
predicted that these mutations are probably highly disruptive given the
role of disulfide bonds in establishing and maintaining protein
structure.

In 2 sibs with late-infantile onset of CLN2 (204500), Sleat et al.
(1997) found compound heterozygosity for a C-to-T transition that
resulted in the conversion of codon 208 (CGA) to a stop codon (TGA). In
the other allele, the conserved AG of the intronic 3-prime splice
junction sequence was changed to AC, which was predicted to result in
intron splicing (607998.0004). Each parent possessed a single different
mutant allele.

Sleat et al. (1997) described compound heterozygosity in 2 sibs with

nonsense mutation (607998.0003); the other allele showed a splice site
mutation, a G-to-C transversion of the consensus AG 3-prime splice
acceptor site immediately preceding 523T of the cDNA sequence.

.0005
CEROID LIPOFUSCINOSIS, NEURONAL, 2

In 2 unrelated patients with juvenile-onset CLN2 (204500), Sleat et al.
(1999) identified a rare monoallelic mutation that resulted in an
arg447-to-his (R447H) substitution in the CLN2 gene. Both of these
patients were compound heterozygotes, with either a monoallelic common
splice junction mutation (607998.0004) or the arg208-to-ter mutation
(607998.0003). Both patients were originally diagnosed with
juvenile-onset CLN3 (204200) on the basis of age at onset, age at death,
and inclusion morphology. Sleat et al. (1999) considered it likely that
the R447H mutation caused incomplete loss of function of the CLN2
protease, resulting in the protracted phenotype. The findings indicated
that an attenuated form of CLN2 (i.e., with juvenile onset) may not be
correctly diagnosed or may be confused with other later-onset
neurodegenerative disorders. Such observations are not uncommon with
other lysosomal storage diseases, in which missense mutations result in
a partial dysfunction and subsequent mild or protracted phenotype. The
possible phenotype of an individual homozygous for the R447H allele
remained unknown.

In a family with first-cousin parents, Berry-Kravis et al. (2000)
demonstrated a 3664C-T transition in the CLN2 gene, resulting in an
arg206-to-cys mutation (R206C), as the cause of late-infantile onset of
CLN2 (204500) and used the mutation successfully for prenatal diagnosis,
demonstrating that the fetus at risk was homozygous for the wildtype
alleles. The homozygous proband had developed seizures at age 3 years
and was unable to ambulate independently by age 5. Electron microscopy
performed on a skin biopsy demonstrated curvilinear bodies typical of
CLN2.

In affected members of 11 of 20 Canadian families with late-infantile

(G284V) mutation in the CLN2 gene, which represented 55% and 32.5% of
families and alleles, respectively, in this study. The authors referred
to this mutation as the Canadian mutation, noting that it had not been
found in any other population.

Moore et al. (2008) identified a homozygous G284V mutation in affected
members from 5 families from Newfoundland with CLN2.

.0008
CEROID LIPOFUSCINOSIS, NEURONAL, 2
TPP1, ASN286SER

In 2 unrelated female patients of Kurdish ethnicity with late infantile
neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (CLN2; 204500), Steinfeld et al. (2002)
identified a homozygous A-to-G transition at nucleotide 857 in exon 7 of
the TPP1 gene. The mutation resulted in an asn286-to-ser (N286S)
substitution that altered 1 of 5 N-glycosylation sites in the TPP1
protein. Both patients had a more protracted clinical course compared
with patients with typical disease progression.

By transient transfection analysis in human embryonic kidney cells,
Tsiakas et al. (2004) found that TPP1 containing the N286S mutation was
synthesized and sorted in the Golgi like wildtype TPP1, but it was
expressed at a lower level and was enzymatically inactive. TPP1 with the
N286 mutation had an apparent molecular mass 2 kD lower than that of
wildtype TPP1, whereas deglycosylation of mutant and wildtype TPP1 led
to proteins of the same size. Tsiakas et al. (2004) concluded that TPP1
with the N286S mutation lacks 1 oligosaccharide chain, resulting in
enzymatic inactivation and possibly prelysosomal protein degradation.

TPP1, IVS7AS, A-G, -10

In a 40-year-old Portuguese man with a mild protracted form of CLN2
(204500), Bessa et al. (2008) identified a homozygous A-to-G transition
in intron 7 (IVS7AS-10A-G) of the TPP1 gene, which created a potential
acceptor site predicted to result in 3 extra amino acids between codons
295 and 296 and not affecting the wildtype splice site. The patient had
onset at age 10 years of progressive cognitive and motor dysfunction and
seizures. Leukocytes and fibroblasts showed decreased TPP1 activity
compared to controls, but about 2-fold higher than that associated with
TPP1-null mutations. Northern blot analysis found normal levels of
correctly spliced CLN2 mRNA in patient fibroblasts, but cDNA sequencing
showed the retention of 9 nucleotides from intron 7, showing that the
alternative splice site was used. Western blot analysis detected a 60%
reduction in overall TPP1 protein levels, suggesting that the mutant
protein had decreased stability. Each unaffected parent was heterozygous
for the mutation, which was not found in 100 control chromosomes. Bessa
et al. (2008) concluded that the mutant protein retained enzyme
activity, which was consistent with the milder phenotype.

602229	TITLE *602229 SRY-BOX 10; SOX10
;;SRY-RELATED HMG-BOX GENE 10;;
DOMINANT MEGACOLON, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; DOM
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The testis-determining gene SRY (480000) encodes a transcription factor
characterized by a DNA-binding motif known as the HMG (high mobility
group) domain. The SOX gene family consists of genes related to SRY,
with a sequence identity of more than 60% to the SRY HMG box.

CLONING

Using a rat SOX10 cDNA probe to screen a human brain cDNA library,
Pingault et al. (1998) isolated a human SOX10 cDNA predicted to encode a
466-amino acid protein with a highly conserved HMG domain.

Pusch et al. (1998) cloned and sequenced the human SOX10 and the mouse
Sox10 genes, which share 98% amino acid identity. Sequence analysis
suggested that SOX9 (608160) and SOX10 have a common evolutionary
origin. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.9-kb SOX10 mRNA in fetal
brain and in adult heart, brain, small intestine, and colon. Low-level
expression was seen in prostate and testis. In mouse embryos, Sox10
expression was detected in the developing peripheral nervous system,
most prominent in the trigeminal, geniculate, and acoustic ganglia.

Kuhlbrodt et al. (1998) cloned the rat SOX10 gene, which encodes a
466-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of approximately 50 kD.
Northern blot analysis detected a 3-kb SOX10 mRNA transcript that was
largely restricted to glial cells in the adult nervous system. During
development, SOX10 first appeared in the forming neural crest and
continued to be expressed as these cells contributed to the forming
peripheral nervous system and finally differentiated into Schwann cells.
In the central nervous system, SOX10 transcripts were originally
confined to glial precursors and later detected in oligodendrocytes of
the adult brain.

Pingault et al. (2013) demonstrated expression of SOX10 in olfactory
ensheathing cells during development of the peripheral olfactory system
in mice and humans.

GENE STRUCTURE

Pingault et al. (1998) determined that the SOX10 gene contains 5 exons.

MAPPING

Lane and Liu (1984) determined that a mouse model of Hirschsprung
disease (HSCR; 142623), dominant megacolon (Dom), mapped to a
mid-terminal region of mouse chromosome 15 (see ANIMAL MODEL).

Pingault et al. (1997) noted that, in mice, natural and in vitro-induced
mutations affecting the Ret (164761), Ednrb (131242), and Edn3 (131244)
genes generated phenotypes similar to human Hirschsprung disease. Using
polymorphisms for conserved human/mouse genes, Pingault et al. (1997)
established homology between the Dom locus and human chromosome
22q12-q13. Two genes, Smstr3 and Adsl (608222), not previously mapped in
the mouse genome, were also mapped to mouse chromosome 15. The
investigators stated that 3 genes, Smstr3, Lgals1 (150570), and Pdgfb
(190040), are possible Dom candidates, as they did not recombine with
the Dom mutation in a backcross.

GENE FUNCTION

Kuhlbrodt et al. (1998) studied 4 SOX10 mutations found in patients with
Waardenburg-Shah syndrome (WS4; 277580). Unlike the rat SOX10 protein,
which failed to show transcriptional activity on its own, wildtype human
SOX10 displayed a weak, but reproducible, activity as a transcriptional
activator. All mutant SOX10 proteins, including the 1 that lacked only
the last 106 amino acids, were deficient in this capacity, indicating
that the C terminus of human SOX10 carries a transactivation domain.
Whereas all 4 mutants failed to transactivate, only 2 failed to enhance
synergistically the activity of other transcription factors. Synergy
required the ability to bind to DNA and a region in the N-terminal part
of SOX10. Those mutants that failed to synergize were unable to bind to
DNA. Analysis of the naturally occurring SOX10 mutations not only helped
to dissect SOX10 structure, but also allowed limited predictions on the
severity of the disease.

To evaluate further the role of Sox10 in development and disease,
Southard-Smith et al. (1999) performed comparative genomic analyses. An
essential role for the SOX10 gene in neural crest development was
supported by zoo blot hybridizations that revealed extensive
conservation throughout vertebrate evolution and by similar Northern
blot expression profiles between mouse and man.

Potterf et al. (2000) elucidated the hierarchical relationship of 3
transcription factors, MITF (156845), PAX3 (606597), and SOX10, that are
capable of producing several different forms of Waardenburg syndrome,
WS2A (193510), WS1 (193500), and WS4 (277580), respectively. SOX10 was
able to transactivate the MITF promoter 100-fold, and the
transactivation was further stimulated by PAX3. By promoter deletion and
mutation analyses, Potterf et al. (2000) showed that SOX10 can activate
MITF expression through binding to a region that is evolutionarily
conserved between the mouse and human MITF promoters. A SOX10 mutant
that models C-terminal truncations in patients with WS can reduce
wildtype SOX10 induction of MITF, suggesting that these mutations may
act in a dominant-negative fashion. The data support a model in which
the hypopigmentation of WS results from a disruption in function of the
central melanocyte transcription factor MITF.

Bondurand et al. (2000) also showed that SOX10, in synergy with PAX3,
strongly activates MITF expression in transfection assays. Transfection
experiments revealed that PAX3 and SOX10 interact directly by binding to
a proximal region of the MITF promoter containing binding sites for both
factors. Mutant SOX10 or PAX3 proteins failed to transactivate this
promoter, providing further evidence that the 2 genes act in concert to
directly regulate expression of MITF. In situ hybridization experiments
carried out in the dominant megacolon (Dom) mouse confirmed that SOX10
dysfunction impaired Mitf expression as well as melanocytic development
and survival. The authors hypothesized that interaction between 3 of the
genes that are altered in WS could explain the auditory/pigmentary
symptoms of this disease.

Lee et al. (2000) demonstrated that wildtype SOX10 directly binds and
activates transcription of the MITF promoter, whereas a mutant form of
the SOX10 protein (602229.0001) associated with Waardenburg-Shah
syndrome acts as a dominant-negative repressor of MITF expression and
reduces endogenous MITF protein levels. The ability of SOX10 to activate
transcription of the MITF promoter implicates SOX10 in the regulation of
melanocyte development and provides a molecular basis for the
hypopigmentation and deafness associated with WS4.

Connexin-32 (CX32, GJB1; 304040) is a major protein of peripheral
myelin. Mutations in CX32 have been characterized in patients with the
X-linked form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTX1; 302800), a
peripheral neuropathy. Bondurand et al. (2001) showed that SOX10, in
synergy with EGR2 (129010), strongly activates CX32 expression in vitro
by directly binding to its promoter. In agreement with this finding,
SOX10 and EGR2 mutants identified in patients with peripheral myelin
defects failed to transactivate the CX32 promoter. In addition, some
CMTX1 patients harbored a T-to-G transversion at position -528 of the
CX32 promoter (304040.0015). The authors demonstrated that this mutation
eliminates binding and activation by SOX10.

SOX10 acts as a critical transactivator of tyrosinase-related protein-1
(TYRP1; 115501) during melanoblast development and as a potent
transactivator of MITF, which is considered to be a master gene that
controls the development and postnatal survival of melanocytes. Khong
and Rosenberg (2002) identified, for the first time, the presence of de
novo cellular immune reactivity against SOX10, using tumor-infiltrating
lymphocytes obtained from a 63-year-old woman with metastases of
melanoma refractory to chemotherapy, who was started on a 4-peptide
vaccination protocol. Most of her tumors completely regressed after 2
cycles of immunotherapy, including complete resolution of a large tumor
in her left thigh, an intrapelvic mass, a liver lesion, and most of the
nodules in her lungs. She also developed vitiligo on the dorsal areas of
her hand and distal forearm bilaterally.

The Sox10 and Pax3 transcription factors can directly regulate both MITF
and RET (164761) in a synergistic fashion. Lang and Epstein (2003)
showed that Pax3 and Sox10 can physically interact; this interaction
contributes to synergistic activation of a conserved RET enhancer, and
it explains why Sox10 mutants that cannot bind DNA still retain the
ability to activate this enhancer in the presence of Pax3. However, in
the context of the MITF gene, Pax3 and Sox10 must each bind
independently to DNA in order to achieve synergy. These observations
appear to explain the phenotype in the mild form of Waardenburg syndrome
(WS2E; 611584) caused by a specific SOX10 mutation (S135T; 602229.0005)
in the HMG box that abrogates DNA binding without disrupting association
with PAX3.

Using gene expression profiling, Iwashita et al. (2003) determined that
genes associated with Hirschsprung disease were highly upregulated in
rat gut neural crest stem cells relative to whole-fetus RNA. The genes
with highest expression were GDNF (600837), SOX10, GFRA1 (601496), and
EDNRB. The highest expression was seen in RET (164761), which was found
to be necessary for neural crest stem cell migration in the gut. GDNF
promoted the migration of neural crest stem cells in culture but did not
affect their survival or proliferation. The observations made by
Iwashita et al. (2003) were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR, flow
cytometry, and functional analysis.

By expression of Sox9 or Sox10 in early Xenopus embryos, Taylor and
LaBonne (2005) found that each factor could direct the formation of
neural crest precursors and the development of a range of neural crest
derivatives. They detected no differences in the activities of Sox9 and
Sox10 in these assays. They identified Sumo1 (601912) and Ubc9 (UBE2I;
601661) as Sox-interacting proteins that play a role in regulating the
function of Sox9 and Sox10 during neural crest and inner ear
development.

Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF; 118945) is a major mediator of the
protective effects of Schwann cells, both under physiologic and
pathologic conditions. Ito et al. (2006) identified SOX10 as a key
regulator of CNTF expression. Overexpression of Sox10 in cultured
primary Schwann cells from rat sciatic nerves upregulated Cntf protein
levels more than 100-fold. In addition, Cntf expression was
significantly lower in sciatic nerves of Sox10 +/- mice, suggesting that
SOX10 acts as a physiologic regulator of CNTF gene expression in vivo.

The specificity of NFAT complexes on target genes arises from assembly
of NFATc family members (see 600489) with nuclear partner proteins.
Purification of Nfat protein complexes from mouse neural tubes showed
that Sox10 is an Nfat nuclear partner and synergizes with Nfatc4
(602699) to activate Krox20 (129010), which regulates genes necessary
for myelination. Protein domain deletion studies indicated that Sox10
bound to the Rel homology domain of Nfatc4. Using oligonucleotide
affinity purification, Kao et al. (2009) found that Nfatc4 facilitated
Sox10 binding to the NRE4 region of the Krox20 myelin-specific enhancer.
Kao et al. (2009) concluded that NFATc4 and Sox10 cooperate in myelin
gene expression.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Waardenburg Syndrome Type 4C

Based on the finding that Sox10 underlies the Dom mouse model (see
ANIMAL MODEL), Southard-Smith et al. (1998) and Herbarth et al. (1998)
considered SOX10 to be a likely candidate for the site of mutations in
individuals with Hirschsprung disease or Waardenburg syndrome whose
disease had not been related to mutations in other genes.

Waardenburg-Shah syndrome, also known as Waardenburg syndrome type 4
(see WS4C; 613266) is characterized by deafness, pigmentary
abnormalities, and Hirschsprung disease. These features are all caused
by defects in the embryonic neural crest. In 4 patients with
Waardenburg-Shah syndrome, Pingault et al. (1998) identified
heterozygous mutations in the SOX10 gene (602229.0001-602229.0004). Each
mutation was predicted to result in loss of function, suggesting that
the pathologic mechanism is haploinsufficiency.

In 2 patients with WS4, Southard-Smith et al. (1999) identified
mutations in the SOX10 gene (602229.0009-602229.0010).

Pingault et al. (2002) identified SOX10 mutations in patients with WS4
with Hirschsprung disease and in patients with WS and intestinal
pseudoobstruction without frank aganglionosis. These results showed that
chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction may be a manifestation associated
with WS, and indicated that aganglionosis is not the only mechanism
underlying the intestinal dysfunction of patients with SOX10 mutations.

Morin et al. (2008) described a de novo missense mutation (602229.0016)
in the gene encoding the SOX10 transcription factor in a Spanish patient
with sporadic WS4.

Bondurand et al. (2007) used a combination of semiquantitative
fluorescent multiplex polymerase chain reaction and fluorescence in situ
hybridization to search for SOX10 heterozygous deletions in cases of
Waardenburg syndrome. They described the first characterization of SOX10
deletions (see, e.g., 602229.0012) in patients presenting with WS4.

- Peripheral Demyelinating Neuropathy, Central Dysmyelination,
Waardenburg Syndrome, and Hirschsprung Disease

Of 12 unrelated Waardenburg-Shah syndrome patients recruited by the
Genetic Center at the Necker Hospital in Paris, Touraine et al. (2000)
described 3 patients with growth retardation and a previously unreported
neurologic phenotype with impairment of both the central and autonomic
nervous systems and occasionally neonatal hypotonia and arthrogryposis
(PCWH; 609136). Each of the 3 patients was heterozygous for a SOX10
truncating mutation: tyr313 to ter (Y313X; 602229.0006) or ser251 to ter
(S251X; 602229.0007). The extended spectrum of the WS4 phenotype was
considered relevant to the brain expression of SOX10 during human
embryonic and fetal development. The expression of SOX10 in human embryo
was not restricted to the neural crest-derived cells but also involved
fetal brain cells, most likely of glial origin. The data emphasized the
important role of SOX10 in early development of both neural
crest-derived tissues, namely melanocytes and autonomic and enteric
nervous systems, and glial cells of the central nervous system.

Pingault et al. (2000) described a patient with a heterozygous mutation
in the SOX10 gene (602229.0019) who had peripheral neuropathy with
hypomyelination, deafness, and chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction, but
not Hirschsprung disease or pigmentary abnormalities. Chronic intestinal
pseudoobstruction is defined by repetitive episodes or continuous
symptoms of bowel obstruction in the absence of a mechanical occluding
lesion. It differs from Hirschsprung disease by the persistence of
ganglionic cells and nervous plexus in the submucosal compartments of
the bowel.

In an infant with pigmentary abnormalities, deafness, and decreased
myenteric and submucosal ganglion cells in the colon and small bowel,
Inoue et al. (2002) identified a heterozygous truncating mutation in the
SOX10 gene (602229.0011). In addition, the patient had little
spontaneous respiratory or other movement, severe hypotonia, multiple
contractures, undetectable tendon reflexes, and tongue fasciculations.
Histopathologic studies showed an absence of peripheral nerve myelin
despite normal numbers of Schwann cells, and profound dysmyelination in
the CNS.

- Waardenburg Syndrome Type 2E

Bondurand et al. (2007) found 5 different SOX10 deletions (see, e.g.,
602229.0013) in 5 patients with WS2E (611584), making SOX10 a new gene
for that form of Waardenburg syndrome. No SOX10 point mutations were
identified by DNA sequencing of the 3 SOX10 coding exons. Neurologic
phenotypes reminiscent of that observed in variant WS4, i.e., PCWH
syndrome (peripheral demyelinating neuropathy, central demyelination,
WS, and Hirschsprung disease; 609136) were observed in some WS2-affected
patients with SOX10 deletions.

Zhang et al. (2012) performed functional analysis of 4 different
heterozygous truncating mutations in the SOX10 gene, 3 reported by Chen
et al. (2010) (e.g., 602229.0021) and 1 novel (602229.0022). In vitro
functional expression studies showed that the mutant proteins lacked the
ability to transactivate the MITF promoter.

Pingault et al. (2013) analyzed the SOX10 gene in 17 patients with
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and anosmia who had been diagnosed with
Kallmann syndrome (see 147950) but who also exhibited at least 1
Waardenburg-like feature, and identified heterozygous SOX10 mutations in
6 of them (see, e.g., 602229.0023). Analysis of SOX10 in 86 more
patients with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and anosmia, 20 of whom had
various nonolfactory, nonreproductive associated anomalies, revealed
heterozygous mutations in 2 patients; 1 of the 2 had hypoacusis and the
other had normal hearing but showed macroscelia. Pingault et al. (2013)
stated that there was no evidence to indicate why a given SOX10 mutation
might be associated with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and anosmia, and
also noted that anosmia and hypogonadism might be underestimated in
Waardenburg syndrome since individuals usually do not spontaneously
complain of anosmia and WS is often diagnosed in childhood.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

In 4 patients with the neurologic variant of Waardenburg-Shah syndrome,
which is also known by the acronym PCWH (peripheral demyelinating
neuropathy, central demyelination, Waardenburg syndrome, and
Hirschsprung disease; 609136), Inoue et al. (2004) identified truncating
mutations in the SOX10 gene; 2 patients, including 1 who had previously
been reported by Jacobs and Wilson (1992), had the Y313X mutation
(602229.0006). All the mutations were located in the last exon (exon 5)
in the 3-prime region of the SOX10 gene. Functional analysis showed that
the truncating mutations suppressed the transcriptional activity of
cotransfected wildtype SOX10 in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that
PCWH is caused by dominant-negative mutations. However, 2 truncating
mutations (E189X; 602229.0001 and Y207X; 602229.0009) associated with
the less severe WS4C phenotype ultimately showed different effects.
Northern blot analysis demonstrated that WS4C-associated mutations, but
not PCWH-associated mutations, lead to a reduction in mRNA via the
nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway, thereby causing
haploinsufficiency and preventing a dominant-negative effect. Inoue et
al. (2004) noted that the results were consistent with the NMD RNA
surveillance pathway, which typically degrades only transcripts
containing nonsense mutations that are followed by at least 1 intron
(Carter et al., 1996; Nagy and Maquat, 1998), as usually occurs with
WS4C-associated mutations. Accordingly, the PCWH-associated mutations
that occur in SOX10 exon 5 are not followed by an intron, may escape
NMD, and express large amounts of dominant-negative protein. Similar
results were obtained for truncating mutations in the myelin protein
zero gene (MPZ; 159440) that cause distinct myelinopathies. Inoue et al.
(2004) suggested that, in general, the NMD mechanism may function
protectively to convert dominant-negative effects to haploinsufficiency.

ANIMAL MODEL

A mouse model of Hirschsprung disease (HSCR; 142623), dominant megacolon
(Dom), arose spontaneously at the Jackson Laboratory (Lane and Liu,
1984). Megacolon was associated with dominantly inherited spotting.
Dom/+ heterozygous mice displayed regional deficiencies of neural
crest-derived enteric ganglia in the distal colon, whereas Dom/Dom
homozygous animals were embryonic lethal. The Dom locus mapped to a
mid-terminal region of mouse chromosome 15.

Using a positional cloning strategy, Southard-Smith et al. (1998)
identified Sox10 as the gene underlying the Dom Hirschsprung mouse
model. BLAST analysis of the EST database identified the candidate
transcript as Sox10 on the basis of its homology with the 163-bp
sequence of the SRY-like HMG box transcription factor Sox10 (Stock et
al., 1996; Wright et al., 1993). The finding was consistent with Sox10
expression in the 2 principal cell types affected in Dom/+ mice, neural
crest-derived melanocytes and enteric ganglia. In Dom mice,
Southard-Smith et al. (1998) identified a premature termination mutation
of Sox10 underlying the absence of neural crest derivatives. They
demonstrated Sox10 expression in normal neural crest cells, disrupted
expression of both Sox10 and the HSCR disease gene Ednrb in Dom mutant
embryos, and loss of neural crest derivatives due to apoptosis. The
authors concluded that Sox10 is essential for proper peripheral nervous
system development. Herbarth et al. (1998) also showed that the Dom
mutant mouse is caused by a defect in the Sox10 gene and that Sox10 is
an essential factor in mouse neural crest development.

Variability in the disease phenotype of patients with WS4 suggests the
influence of genetic modifier loci in the disorder. Mice heterozygous
for the Sox10(Dom) allele exhibit variability of aganglionosis and
hypopigmentation influenced by genetic background similar to that
observed in WS4 patients. Southard-Smith et al. (1999) constructed
Sox10(Dom)/+ congenic lines to segregate loci that modify the neural
crest defects in the heterozygous mice. Consistent with previous
studies, increased lethality in the heterozygous mice resulted from a
C57BL/6J locus; also, an increase in hypopigmentation was noted in
conjunction with a locus in another strain. Linkage analysis localized a
hypopigmentation modifier of the Dom phenotype to mouse chromosome 10 in
close proximity to a modifier of hypopigmentation for the EDNRB (131244)
mouse model of WS4.

Paratore et al. (2002) used mice with a targeted deletion of the Sox10
gene to study the etiology of Hirschsprung disease. Neural crest-derived
enteric progenitors that were heterozygous for the Sox10 mutation
colonized the proximal intestine but were unaffected in their survival
capacity. However, unlike their wildtype counterparts, mutant enteric
neural crest-derived cells were unable to maintain their progenitor
state and acquired preneuronal traits, which resulted in a reduction of
the progenitor pool size. Thus, the cells that normally colonize the
hindgut were depleted in the Sox10 mutant, causing the distal bowel to
become aganglionic.

Cantrell et al. (2004) tested for association between genes in the
endothelin signaling pathway and severity of aganglionosis in an
extended pedigree of B6C3FeLe.Sox10(Dom) mice. Single-locus association
analysis identified interaction between EdnrB (131244) and Sox10.
Additional analysis of F2 intercross progeny confirmed a highly
significant effect of EdnrB alleles on the Sox10(Dom/+) phenotype. The
presence of C57BL/6J alleles at EdnrB was associated with increased
penetrance and more severe aganglionosis in Sox10(Dom) mutants. Crosses
between EdnrB and Sox10 mutants corroborated this gene interaction, with
double-mutant progeny exhibiting significantly more severe
aganglionosis. The background strain of the EdnrB mutant further
influenced the phenotype of Sox10/EdnrB double-mutant progeny, implying
the action of additional modifiers on this phenotype.

Owens et al. (2005) focused on enteric ganglia deficits in Sox10(Dom)
mice and defined aganglionosis as a quantitative trait in Sox10(Dom)
intercross progeny to investigate the contribution of strain background
to variation in enteric nervous system deficits. The phenotype of
Sox10(Dom/+) mutants ranged over a continuum from severe aganglionosis
to no detectable phenotype in the gut. A SNP-based genome scan in
Sox10(Dom/+) F1 intercross progeny revealed modifier loci on mouse
chromosomes 3, 5, 8, 11, and 14 with distinct effects on penetrance and
severity of aganglionosis.

Using an N-ethyl-N-nitrosurea mutagenesis screen, Matera et al. (2008)
identified Gli3 (165240) as a modifier of Sox10 neurocristopathy.
Heterozygosity for a null mutation of Gli3 increased the penetrance and
severity of the hypopigmentation phenotype of Sox10 +/- mice.

Polanco et al. (2010) showed that transgenic expression of Sox10, a
close relative of Sox9 (608160), in gonads of XX mice resulted in
development of testes and male physiology. The degree of sex reversal
correlated with levels of Sox10 expression in different transgenic
lines. Sox10 was expressed at low levels in primordial gonads of both
sexes during normal mouse development, becoming male-specific during
testis differentiation. SOX10 protein was able to activate
transcriptional targets of SOX9, explaining at a mechanistic level its
ability to direct male development. Overexpression of SOX10 alone was
able to mimic human 46,XX disorder of sexual development (DSD)
phenotypes associated with duplication of chromosome 22q13. Given that
human SOX10 maps to chromosome 22q13.1, Polanco et al. (2010) implicated
SOX10 in the etiology of chromosome 22q13-related DSD.

Cossais et al. (2010) used in ovo electroporation in the developing
neural tube of chicken to determine which regions and properties of
SOX10 are required for early neural crest development. There was a
strict reliance on the DNA-binding activity and the presence of the
C-terminal transactivation domain, and a lesser influence of the
dimerization function and a conserved domain in the center of the
protein. Dominant-negative effects on early neural crest development
were mostly observed for truncated SOX10 proteins, whose production in
patients may be prevented by nonsense-mediated decay. In contrast,
mutant SOX10 proteins that occurred in patients were usually inactive.
The authors proposed that any dominant-negative activity that some
mutants may possess must therefore be restricted to single neural
crest-derived cell lineages or oligodendrocytes at later times.

In SOX10-null mice, Pingault et al. (2013) observed an almost complete
absence of olfactory ensheathing cells along the olfactory nerve
pathway, as well as defasciculation and misrouting of the nerve fibers,
impaired migration of GnRH cells, and disorganization of the olfactory
nerve layer of the olfactory bulbs.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
WAARDENBURG SYNDROME, TYPE 4C
SOX10, GLU189TER

In a child with bilateral profound hearing loss, short segment
Hirschsprung disease, and pigmentary abnormalities, including white
hair, blue irides with gray speckles, and depigmented skin patches, all
features consistent with WS4C (613266), Pingault et al. (1998)
identified a heterozygous glu189-to-ter mutation (E189X) in the SOX10
gene. The de novo mutation truncated the SOX10 protein, leaving the HMG
binding domain intact.

.0002
WAARDENBURG SYNDROME, TYPE 4C
SOX10, TYR83TER

In a boy with WS4C (613266) characterized by bilateral profound hearing
loss (treated by a cochlear implant), fair hair and vivid blue eyes, and
chronic bowel problems, Pingault et al. (1998) identified a heterozygous
de novo nonsense tyr83-to-ter mutation (Y83X) in the SOX10 gene. Rectal
biopsy showed that the number of ganglia was dramatically reduced. The
de novo mutation was located upstream of the HMG domain.

.0003
WAARDENBURG SYNDROME, TYPE 4C
SOX10, 6-BP INS, NT482

In a patient with deafness and short segment aganglionosis (613266),
Pingault et al. (1998) found a heterozygous 6-bp insertion (GCTCCT)
between nucleotides 482 and 483 in exon 4 of the SOX10 gene. The
mutation resulted in duplication of arg161leu162 in the middle of helix
3 of the HMG domain. This duplication changed the spacing between 2
highly conserved residues and was likely to disrupt the structure of the
DNA-binding domain.

.0004
WAARDENBURG SYNDROME, TYPE 4C
SOX10, 2-BP DEL, 1076GA

In a patient with HSCR, deafness, and hypopigmentation (613266),
Pingault et al. (1998) identified a heterozygous 2-bp deletion
(1076delGA) in exon 5 of the SOX10 gene, resulting in a frameshift that
altered the mRNA sequence and introduced a premature termination codon
at position 400. This and the other 3 mutations identified by Pingault
et al. (1998) were likely to result in a loss of function, suggesting
that the pathologic mechanism in Waardenburg-Shah syndrome is
haploinsufficiency and that the developmental process is sensitive to
the exact level of the SOX10 product.

.0005
WAARDENBURG SYNDROME, TYPE 2E, WITHOUT NEUROLOGIC INVOLVEMENT
SOX10, SER135THR

In a girl with a mild form of Waardenburg syndrome type 2E (611584),
reported by Hennekam and Gorlin (1996), Bondurand et al. (1999)
identified a heterozygous ser135-to-thr (S135T) mutation in the SOX10
gene. She had cutaneous hypo- and hyperpigmented regions and hearing
loss.

SYNDROME, AND HIRSCHSPRUNG DISEASE
SOX10, TYR313TER

In 2 unrelated patients (one living in Germany and the second in
France), Touraine et al. (2000) observed a neurologic variant of
Waardenburg-Shah syndrome (609136) associated with a tyr313-to-ter
(Y313X) mutation in the SOX10 gene.

In 2 patients with a neurologic variant of Waardenburg-Shah syndrome,
one of whom had previously been reported by Jacobs and Wilson (1992),
Inoue et al. (2004) identified a tyr313-to-ter (Y313X) mutation in the
SOX10 gene. In the 27-year-old male previously reported by Jacobs and
Wilson (1992), the Y313X mutation was the result of a 1-bp insertion
(938insA); in the other patient, an 18-year-old male, the Y313X mutation
was the result of a 939C-G transversion. Both patients had muscle
wasting/atrophy, pes cavus, and areflexia/hyporeflexia, indicating
peripheral neuropathy. Both had developmental delay and hypotonia,
indicative of dysmyelination, with nystagmus and spastic diplegia also
present in the younger patient. Both patients had hypopigmentation and
neurosensory deafness, indicating dysmyelinating Waardenburg syndrome,
and both had long segment Hirschsprung disease.

SOX10, SER251TER

Touraine et al. (2000) found a ser251-to-ter (S251X) truncating mutation
of the SOX10 gene in a child in France with a neurologic variant of
Waardenburg-Shah syndrome (609136). There was no history of either WS or
Hirschsprung disease (142623) in other members of the family.

.0008
PERIPHERAL DEMYELINATING NEUROPATHY, CENTRAL DYSMYELINATION, WAARDENBURG
SYNDROME, AND HIRSCHSPRUNG DISEASE
SOX10, 12-BP DEL, EXON 5

Inoue et al. (1999) described a patient presenting with a neurologic
variant of Waardenburg-Shah syndrome (PCWH; 609136) characterized by
severe dysmyelination compatible with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (see
312080) and peripheral neuropathy consistent with Charcot-Marie-Tooth
disease type I (see 118200), in addition to Waardenburg-Hirschsprung
syndrome (277580). In the patient, Inoue et al. (1999) identified a
novel heterozygous 12-bp deletion in exon 5 of the SOX10 gene that did
not disrupt the coding region, but extended the peptide and hence was
thought to act as a dominant-negative allele. There was a 6-bp direct
repeat in the wildtype SOX10 sequence that flanked the deletion,
suggesting that the deletion may have been mediated by DNA polymerase
slippage between these direct repeats. The healthy parents and sibs did
not have this deletion, indicating that this was a de novo mutation.
Deletion started at the second nucleotide of the TAA stop codon,
resulting in disruption of the stop codon, and, by conceptual
translation, an extension of 82 amino acids on the carboxy terminus
without any other alterations in the putative SOX10 protein. The 12-bp
deletion converted the carboxy-terminal codon from TAA (stop) to TGT
(cys).

By in vitro functional expression assays, Inoue et al. (2007) showed
that the 12-bp deletion led to severely diminished transcription and
DNA-binding activity of SOX10. However, the mutant protein did not show
dominant-negative interference with wildtype SOX10 in vitro. Within the
additional 82-amino acid tail, an 11-amino acid region (termed the WR
domain) presumably formed an alpha-helix structure and inhibited SOX10
transcription activity if inserted in the C-terminal half of the
protein. The WR domain also affected other transcription factors with a
graded effect when fused to the C terminus, suggesting that it elicited
a toxic functional activity. Inoue et al. (2007) concluded that the
molecular pathology caused by the 12-bp deletion and its resulting
extension was distinct from that of more common premature termination
mutations. Failure to properly terminate SOX10 translation resulted in
the generation of a deleterious functional domain and a gain-of-function
effect.

.0009
WAARDENBURG SYNDROME, TYPE 4C
SOX10, TYR207TER

Southard-Smith et al. (1999) described heterozygosity for a
tyr207-to-ter (Y207X) mutation in a patient with Waardenburg syndrome
type 4C (613266) manifested by short segment Hirschsprung disease,
profound sensorineural hearing loss, and hypopigmentation on the abdomen
and neck. Both parents were phenotypically normal and neither carried
the mutation. The mutation was in exon 4, 27 residues downstream of the
carboxyl end of the HMG box and 14 residues downstream of the
corresponding site in the Sox10(Dom) mouse where the single basepair
insertion is located.

WAARDENBURG SYNDROME, TYPE 4C

SOX10, GLN377TER

In a boy with Waardenburg syndrome type 4C (613266), Southard-Smith et
al. (1999) found a gln377-to-ter (Q377X) mutation that truncated the
SOX10 protein within the transcription modulation domain. The
heterozygous proband had sensorineural deafness and variable diagnoses
of enteric function ranging from hypoganglionosis to long segment
Hirschsprung disease. He also had nystagmus and ataxic cerebral palsy.
His sister was also profoundly deaf and had nystagmus and cerebral
palsy, but did not have Hirschsprung disease (WS2E; 611584).

PERIPHERAL DEMYELINATING NEUROPATHY, CENTRAL DYSMYELINATION, WAARDENBURG
SYNDROME, AND HIRSCHSPRUNG DISEASE
SOX10, GLN250TER

Inoue et al. (2002) reported a male infant with peripheral demyelinating
neuropathy, central dysmyelination, Waardenburg syndrome, and
Hirschsprung disease (PCWH; 609136) who was heterozygous for a 748C-T
transition in the SOX10 gene, resulting in a gln250-to-ter (Q250X)
substitution. The patient presented at birth with a white forelock and
hyperpigmented and hypopigmented patches on the face, body, and limbs,
deafness, and chronic ileus. He never passed meconium and required
repeated segmental small and large bowel resections. Myenteric and
submucosal ganglion cells were severely diminished throughout the entire
colon and much of the small bowel. In addition, he had little
spontaneous respiratory or other movement, severe hypotonia, multiple
contractures, undetectable tendon reflexes, and tongue fasciculations.
Histopathologic studies showed an absence of peripheral nerve myelin
despite normal numbers of Schwann cells, and profound dysmyelination in
the CNS. He remained ventilator-dependent his entire life and died at 83
days of age of Pseudomonas aeruginosa sepsis. The observations suggested
that some SOX10 mutations, such as Q250X, may allow Schwann cells and
oligodendrocytes to proliferate but interfere with further
differentiation to form myelin. In contrast to SOX10 loss-of-function
mutations causing only WS4C (613266), mutations associated with both
peripheral and central dysmyelination may affect pathology through a
dominant-negative mechanism.

.0012
WAARDENBURG SYNDROME, TYPE 4C
SOX10, 1128-BP DEL/3-BP INS

In a 1-year-old boy with Waardenburg syndrome type 4C (613266),
Bondurand et al. (2007) identified a heterozygous deletion that removed
part of exon 5 of the SOX10 gene. The mutation comprised a 1,128-bp
deletion encompassing 740 bp of intron 4 and 388 bp of exon 5, and a
3-bp insertion (697-740_1085del ins CCT). The patient had short-segment
Hirschsprung disease, bilateral sensorineural deafness, hair and skin
hypopigmentation, and bilateral cryptorchidism.

.0013
WAARDENBURG SYNDROME, TYPE 2E, WITHOUT NEUROLOGIC INVOLVEMENT
SOX10, 253-BP DEL

In a 9-year-old boy with Waardenburg syndrome type 2 (WS2E; 611584) and
in his similarly affected brother, Bondurand et al. (2007) identified a
heterozygous 253-bp deletion in the SOX10 gene (219_428+43del). The
deletion removed 210 bp of exon 3 and 43 bp of intron 3. The proband had
profound deafness, pigmentation abnormalities of the skin and eyes, but
no Hirschsprung disease or mental retardation. The patient's mother
exhibited somatic mosaicism for the mutation.

.0014
WAARDENBURG SYNDROME, TYPE 2E, WITHOUT NEUROLOGIC INVOLVEMENT
SOX10, 1,777-BP DEL

In an 8-year-old boy with Waardenburg syndrome type 2 (WS2E; 611584),
Bondurand et al. (2007) identified heterozygosity for a 1,777-bp
deletion in the SOX10 gene that removed the whole exon 4, 1,112 bp of
intron 3, and 396 bp of intron 4 (429-1112_697+396del). The mutation was
inherited from the mother, who also had WS2.

.0015
WAARDENBURG SYNDROME, TYPE 2E, WITHOUT NEUROLOGIC INVOLVEMENT
SOX10, 1-BP DEL, 506C

In a Japanese girl with Waardenburg syndrome type 2E (611584), Iso et
al. (2008) identified a heterozygous 1-bp deletion (506delC) in exon 4
of the SOX10 gene, predicted to result in a frameshift and premature
termination that would remove the C-terminal part of the HMG domain and
the whole transactivation domain. She had ocular albinism, a white
forelock, and sensorineural deafness.

.0016
WAARDENBURG SYNDROME, TYPE 4C
SOX10, ALA157VAL

In an 18-month old Spanish boy with severe sensorineural hearing loss,
Hirschsprung disease, and heterochromia irides but neither pigmentary
abnormalities in the skin nor white forelock (613266), Morin et al.
(2008) identified a 470C-T transition in the SOX10 gene, resulting in an
ala157-to-val (A157V) change in the predicted polypeptide. The mutation
affects the alanine at position 56 in the highly conserved HMG domain.
The side chain of ala56 participates in interactions between the
N-terminal end of helix 1 and helix 3. Morin et al. (2008) proposed that
the A157V mutation could disturb these interactions through steric
hindrance, destabilizing the HMG domain. The mutation was not present in
the patient's parents, his brother, or in 95 unrelated Spanish controls.

.0017
WAARDENBURG SYNDROME, TYPE 2E, WITH NEUROLOGIC INVOLVEMENT
SOX10, IVS4AS, A-C, -2

In a boy with Waardenburg syndrome type 2E (611584), Sznajer et al.
(2008) identified a heterozygous de novo A-to-C transversion in intron 4
of the SOX10 gene. In addition to sensorineural deafness and vivid blue
eyes, he had neurologic abnormalities, including white matter anomalies,
mental retardation with autistic-like behavior, hypotonia, and a
generalized peripheral neuropathy. Brain imaging showed complete
agenesis of the semicircular canals. Hirschsprung disease was absent.
Sznajer et al. (2008) hypothesized that the mutation decreased the
strength of the acceptor splice site and increased the strength of at
least 1 cryptic site 5 nucleotides downstream. Utilization of this
cryptic site would cause a frameshift and premature termination 46
residues downstream. The mutation was not present in either parent or in
300 control chromosomes.

.0018
WAARDENBURG SYNDROME, TYPE 2E, WITH NEUROLOGIC INVOLVEMENT
SOX10, GLN174PRO

In a 21-month-old boy with Waardenburg syndrome type 2E (611584),
Barnett et al. (2009) identified a heterozygous 521A-C transversion in
exon 4 of the SOX10 gene, resulting in a gln174-to-pro (Q174P)
substitution in the highly conserved HMG domain. He had sensorineural
deafness, fair skin and hair pigmentation, multiple tiny lentigines,
cafe au lait spots, and light blue irides, but no evidence of
Hirschsprung disease. He also showed neurologic involvement, with
hypotonia, poor vision with intermittent nystagmus in early life,
inability to fix or follow, and increased muscle tone. Brain imaging
showed absence of the cochlear nerves, absence of the olfactory bulbs,
and brain hypomyelination.

SOX10, 1-BP DEL, 795G

In a girl with a phenotype consistent with PCWH (609136), Pingault et
al. (2000) identified a de novo heterozygous 1-bp deletion (795delG) in
the SOX10 gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination. She
had peripheral neuropathy with marked slowing of nerve conduction
velocities resulting in delayed motor development, chronic intestinal
pseudoobstruction, hypolacrimation, absence of sweating, and deafness.
The peripheral nerve histologic features were more consistent with a
developmental dysregulation defect than a degenerative process.

PERIPHERAL DEMYELINATING NEUROPATHY, CENTRAL DYSMYELINATION, WAARDENBURG
SYNDROME, AND HIRSCHSPRUNG DISEASE
SOX10, 1-BP DEL, 915G

In a Spanish boy with PCWH (609136), Vinuela et al. (2009) identified a
de novo heterozygous 1-bp deletion (915delG) in exon 5 of the SOX10
gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination at residue
306. The patient had Hirschsprung disease since birth and progressive
sensorineural hearing loss associated with hypoplasia of the cochlea. He
had blue eyes, but no pigmentary anomalies of the skin or white
forelock. Neurologic findings included congenital nystagmus and delayed
motor development due to hypotonia and spasticity. Brain MRI showed
central dysmyelinization. Vinuela et al. (2009) noted that the location
of this mutation would cause an escape from nonsense-mediated decay and
generate a dominant-negative effect resulting in neurologic features,
consistent with the findings of Inoue et al. (2004).

.0021
WAARDENBURG SYNDROME, TYPE 2E, WITHOUT NEUROLOGIC INVOLVEMENT
SOX10, 2-BP DEL, 743AG

In a Chinese father and daughter with WS2E (611584), Zhang et al. (2012)
identified a heterozygous 2-bp deletion, 743delAG, in exon 5 of the
SOX10 gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination at codon
248 (Glu248fsTer30). The truncated protein lacked the transactivation
domain but retained the DNA-binding domain. In vitro functional
expression studies in human cells showed that the mutant protein was
expressed and localized only to the nucleus, but did not transactivate
the MITF (156845) promoter and acted in a dominant-negative manner.
However, the mutant protein was degraded faster than wildtype SOX10,
which Zhang et al. (2012) postulated may have resulted in
haploinsufficiency and the somewhat mild phenotype. Both patients had
bilateral profound hearing loss and bilateral heterochromia irides, but
no additional features.

.0022
WAARDENBURG SYNDROME, TYPE 2E, WITHOUT NEUROLOGIC INVOLVEMENT
SOX10, 1-BP DEL, 113G

In a Chinese boy with WS2E (611584), Chen et al. (2010) identified a
heterozygous 1-bp deletion (113delG) in exon 3 of the SOX10 gene,
resulting in a frameshift and premature termination (Gly38fsTer69). In
functional studies, Zhang et al. (2012) demonstrated that the truncated
protein was expressed and lacked the nuclear localization signal; it
showed localization in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, but did not
transactivate the MITF (156845) promoter, consistent with
haploinsufficiency. The patient had bilateral profound hearing loss and
bilateral heterochromia irides, but no additional features.

.0023
WAARDENBURG SYNDROME, TYPE 2E, WITHOUT NEUROLOGIC INVOLVEMENT
SOX10, 2T-G

In a 26-year-old man with unilateral deafness, white hair, anosmia,
cryptorchidism, and micropenis (WSE2; 611584), Pingault et al. (2013)
identified heterozygosity for a c.2T-G transversion in the SOX10 gene.
Luciferase reporter-gene analysis in transfected HeLa cells showed
reduced or absent transactivation capacity with the mutant compared to
wildtype. The proband's mother also had unilateral deafness, and his
sister was anosmic; their mutation status was unknown.

602138	TITLE *602138 NADH-UBIQUINONE OXIDOREDUCTASE 1 ALPHA SUBCOMPLEX, 6; NDUFA6
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

See NDUFA2 (602137). Ton et al. (1997) isolated human heart cDNAs
encoding CI-B14 (NDUFA6) and 4 other complex I subunits.

MAPPING

By intron-based radiation hybrid mapping, Emahazion and Brookes (1998)
assigned the NDUFA6 gene to 22q13.1. Dunbar et al. (1997) had mapped the
NDUFA6 gene to 21q22 by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).
Emahazion and Brookes (1998) stated that subsequent mapping studies with
subfragments of the FISH-mapped recombinants of Dunbar et al. (1997)
suggested chimerism and confirmed that the earlier FISH data were
flawed.

;;LISTERIA-INDUCED GENE; LIND;;
FLJ21162
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using differential display RT-PCR, followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE,
Staege et al. (2001) isolated a cDNA encoding TNIP3, which they called
LIND, that was upregulated in monocytes infected with Listeria
monocytogenes. The predicted 325-amino acid protein contains 3
coiled-coil domains and is most likely localized to the nucleus. The
authors identified potential splice sites that would result in variants
with different C termini. Northern blot analysis detected 1.7- and
2.4-kb transcripts in Listeria-infected monocytes, but not in uninfected
controls. RT-PCR analysis showed highest expression in lung, lymph node,
thymus, and fetal liver, with lower levels in brain, spleen, leukocytes,
and tonsils. Northern blot analysis of multiple tissues showed no
expression.

611616	TITLE *611616 NAD KINASE; NADK
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NADK catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to NAD to
generate NADP, which in its reduced form acts as an electron donor for
biosynthetic reactions (Lerner et al., 2001).

CLONING

By EST database analysis using prokaryotic DNA kinase sequences as
probe, followed by PCR of a human fibroblast cDNA library, Lerner et al.
(2001) cloned NADK. The deduced 446-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 49.2 kD. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.0-kb
transcript with high expression in placenta, moderate expression in
brain, colon, heart, liver, kidney, lung, spleen, stomach, and testis,
and low expression in small intestine. A band of 1.8 kb was detected in
several tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Using recombinant NADK overexpressed in E. coli, Lerner et al. (2001)
showed that purified NADK catalyzed the synthesis of NADP from NAD and
ATP. By gel filtration analysis, they determined that catalytically
active human NADK was a homotetramer. NADK exhibited a specific activity
of 6.7 microM with a high specificity for NAD and ATP substrates. NADK
activity was resistant to heat treatment, had an optimum pH of 7-8, and
required divalent cations. NADK displayed a preference for zinc and
manganese ions over magnesium ions, while copper and nickel ions had no
effect on enzyme activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lerner et al. (2001) determined that the NADK gene contains 11 exons
spanning 14 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Lerner et al. (2001) mapped the NADK gene
to chromosome 1p36.33-p36.21.

603759	TITLE *603759 LIM HOMEOBOX GENE 2; LHX2
;;LIM HOX GENE 2; LH2
DESCRIPTION See LHX1 (601999) for a discussion of this gene family.

CLONING

Xu et al. (1993) identified in the rat a LIM-Hox gene closely related to
'apterous' in Drosophila. (They referred to the gene as LH2.) LH2 is
expressed in the rodent in both developing and adult central nervous
system, in immature but not mature B cells, and in T cells. Mouse Lh2 is
expressed in rodent pituitary glands and acts as a transcriptional
regulator of the promoter of the pituitary glycoprotein hormone alpha
subunit (Roberson et al., 1994). Wu et al. (1996) isolated the human
homolog of LH2, a putative transcription factor containing 2 LIM domains
and a HOX DNA-binding domain. High levels of expression of this gene
were observed in all cases of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML; 608232)
tested, regardless of disease status. Expression of LH2 was also
observed in lymphoid malignancies and myeloid cell lines, but not in
primary cases of acute myelogenous leukemia. Wu et al. (1996) commented
that LH2 may prove useful as a marker of CML for monitoring residual
disease.

GENE FUNCTION

Mangale et al. (2008) demonstrated that Lhx2 acts as a classic selector
gene and essential intrinsic determinant of cortical identity. Lhx2
selector activity is restricted to an early critical period when stem
cells comprise the cortical neuroepithelium, where it acts cell
autonomously to specify cortical identity and suppress alternative fates
in a spatially-dependent manner. Laterally, Lhx2-null cells adopt
antihem identity, whereas medially they become cortical hem cells, which
can induce and organize ectopic hippocampal fields. Mangale et al.
(2008) concluded that, in addition to providing functional evidence for
Lhx2 selector activity, their findings showed that the cortical hem is a
hippocampal organizer.

MAPPING

Wu et al. (1996) mapped the LH2 gene to 9q33-q34.1, in the same region
as the break of the reciprocal translocation that creates the BCR-ABL
chimera of the Philadelphia chromosome in CML; LH2 was retained on the
derivative chromosome 9 and is therefore centromeric to ABL (189980).
The proximity of LH2 to the breakpoint on chromosome 9 raised the
possibility of cis-activation by the t(9;22)(q34;q11) translocation. The
chromosomal assignment was achieved by fluorescence in situ
hybridization and confirmed by Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA
from hamster/human hybrid cells.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hirota and Mombaerts (2004) reported that Lhx2 -/- mice had defects in
the development of the eyes, forebrain, and erythrocytes and died a few
days before birth due to severe anemia. The olfactory epithelium of
mutant mice was grossly normal, but there was a failure of olfactory
receptor gene expression and incomplete development of olfactory sensory
neurons.

Wandzioch et al. (2004) found that livers of Lhx2 -/- mouse embryos
contained numerous activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and showed an
increased deposition of extracellular matrix proteins associated with
liver fibrosis. Transfection of mouse Lhx2 into a human HSC line
downregulated expression of genes characteristic of activated HSCs. Lhx2
-/- mouse liver also showed disrupted cellular organization and altered
gene expression of intrahepatic endodermal cells, and increased
deposition of matrix proteins preceded these abnormalities. Wandzioch et
al. (2004) concluded that LHX2 negatively regulates HSC activation and
that its inactivation in developing HSCs mimics the signals triggered by
the wound-healing response to chronic liver injury.

To define how hair follicle stem cells are specified and maintained in
an undifferentiated state, Rhee et al. (2006) developed a strategy to
isolate and transcriptionally profile embryonic hair progenitors in
mice. They identified Lhx2 as a transcription factor positioned
downstream of signals necessary to specify hair follicle stem cells, but
upstream from signals required to drive activated stem cells to
terminally differentiate. Using gain- and loss-of-function studies, Rhee
et al. (2006) uncovered a role for Lhx2 in maintaining the growth and
undifferentiated properties of hair follicle progenitors.

DESCRIPTION 
MAPPING

By isotopic in situ hybridization, Rousseau-Merck et al. (1995) assigned
the KOX9 gene to 8q24, where the KOX4 gene (194531) had been previously
mapped. From pulsed field gel electrophoresis data, they concluded that
KOX4 and KOX9 lie within less than 580 kb of each other. They tabulated
a total of 18 different KOX genes that are located in pairs within 9 DNA
fragments of 200 to 580 kb on 7 different chromosomes.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases using a cadherin (see 192090) motif, Hong et al.
(2004) identified CDHJ and PCDHJ. CDHJ has 25 exons and encodes a
deduced 2,916-amino acid protein containing a long N-terminal ectodomain
with numerous individual cadherin domains, followed by a transmembrane
domain and a C-terminal domain. PCDHJ has 2 exons and encodes a deduced
702-amino acid protein with 5 cadherin domains. PCR analysis detected 2
CDHJ variants in cerebral cortex and testis only. Hartz (2008)
determined that the CDHJ and PCDHJ transcripts use nonoverlapping
5-prime and 3-prime exons of the full-length DCHS2 gene, respectively.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Hong et al. (2004) mapped the DCHS2 gene
to chromosome 4q31.3. They mapped the mouse Dchs2 gene to a syntenic
region of mouse chromosome 3.

605343	TITLE *605343 FOLLISTATIN-LIKE 3; FSTL3
;;FOLLISTATIN-RELATED GENE; FLRG
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Follistatin-like-3 (FSTL3) is a member of the follistatin-module protein
family, which is composed of extracellular matrix-associated
glycoproteins thought to act in a paracrine manner to bind morphogens or
growth/differentiation factors and regulate their activity during
development (Hayette et al., 1998).

CLONING

Hayette et al. (1998) studied a t(11;19) translocation from a B-cell
chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell line in which an aberrant cyclin D1
(CCND1; 168461) transcript on chromosome 11 was juxtaposed to a
transcriptional unit on chromosome 19 (Rimokh et al., 1993). They
identified this transcriptional unit by screening a human placenta cDNA
library with a probe derived from fragments spanning the 19q13
breakpoint. The FSTL3 cDNA, which they called FLRG (follistatin-related
gene), encodes a deduced 263-amino acid protein that shares 85% amino
acid identity with mouse Fstl3. It contains 2 cysteine-rich repeats that
are closely related to the class 1-1 follistatin modules present in
other follistatin family members. Northern blot analysis demonstrated
expression of a 2.5-kb transcript in placenta, amniocytes, chorionic
villosities, and bone marrow stromal cells, with weaker expression in
fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and endothelial cells. A 1.3-kb transcript
was also detected in some human tissues and was thought to result from
use of an alternate polyadenylation site. Expression was not detected in
any normal hematopoietic tissues. Northern blot analysis with mouse
tissues showed expression in adult testis, kidney, muscle, lung, and
heart as well as during gastrulation (embryonic day 7). Transfection of
the FSTL3 cDNA into COS-7 cells resulted in expression of a 33-kD
protein in the supernatant. The FSTL3 protein contains 2 potential
N-glycosylation sites and the predicted mass of the unmodified core
protein is 27 kD. These observations are consistent with FSTL3
functioning as a secreted glycoprotein.

By Northern blot analysis, Tortoriello et al. (2001) found nearly
ubiquitous expression of FSTL3 in human adult and fetal tissues, with
highest expression in testis, placenta, heart, and pancreas. They noted
that FSTL3 mRNA was expressed by all cells examined, but the protein was
secreted from only a minority of the cultures. Using a cell line
expressing both FSTL3 and follistatin (FST; 136470), Tortoriello et al.
(2001) localized FSTL3 to the nuclear compartment and FST to the
cytoplasm. Fractionation of transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells
confirmed the nuclear localization of FSTL3.

GENE FUNCTION

Bartholin et al. (2001) cloned the promoter region of the FLRG gene and
defined the minimal region necessary for transcription activation in a
reporter-system assay. They showed that the fragment between positions
-130 and +6, which consists of multiple consensus Sp1 (SP1;
189906)-binding sites, is required for the constitutive expression of
the FLRG gene. They further demonstrated that FLRG mRNA expression is
rapidly induced by TGF-beta (190180) or by transfection with SMAD
protein (e.g., 601595) expression vectors in human HepG2 cells. Other
data showed that through specific interactions with the SMAD-binding
element consensus motif found in the FLRG promoter, SMAD proteins
participate in the regulation of expression of FLRG, a new target of
TGF-beta transcription activation.

Using recombinant mouse Fstl3, Tsuchida et al. (2000) found that Fstl3
bound both activin (see 147290) and BMP2 (112261) and had a higher
affinity for activin. They located the activin-binding domain in the
second follistatin domain of the C terminus. Overexpression of Fstl3
inhibited BMP2-induced cell signaling in a reporter assay.

In addition to the t(11;19) translocation in a case of B-cell chronic
lymphocytic leukemia from which FSTL3 was isolated, Hayette et al.
(1998) also observed rearrangement of the FSTL3 gene in a case of B-cell
non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL; 605027) and in a case of B-cell mantle zone
lymphoma, suggesting that FSTL3 may be involved in the leukemogenesis
process.

Schneyer et al. (2004) reviewed the differential actions of FST and
FSTL3. They noted that both FST and FSTL3 bind and inhibit activin B
(147390) less efficiently than activin A.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hayette et al. (1998) determined that the FSTL3 gene extends over 7 kbp
and contains 5 exons.

MAPPING

By Southern blot analysis of somatic cell hybrids and FISH, Hayette et
al. (1998) localized the FSTL3 gene to chromosome 19p13.

ANIMAL MODEL

Mukherjee et al. (2007) generated Fstl3 -/- mice, which survived to
adulthood and developed a distinct group of metabolic phenotypes
including increased pancreatic islet number and size, beta cell
hyperplasia, decreased visceral fat mass, improved glucose tolerance,
and enhanced insulin sensitivity. The mice also developed hepatic
steatosis and mild hypertension but exhibited no alteration of muscle or
body weight. Mukherjee et al. (2007) suggested that this combination of
phenotypes arises from increased activin (see 147290) and myostatin
(MSTN; 601788) bioactivity in specific tissues, and concluded that FSTL3
regulation of activin and myostatin is critical for normal adult
metabolic homeostasis.

604998	TITLE *604998 CALCIUM/CALMODULIN-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE I; CAMK1
;;CAMKI
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Calcium/calmodulin (see CALM1; 114180)-dependent protein kinases (CAMKs)
are a subfamily of the serine/threonine protein kinase family. Multiple
substrates for rodent Camk1 have been identified, including SYN1
(313440), SYN2 (600755), CREB (see 123810), and CFTR (602421). Camk1
activity is dependent upon its phosphorylation by a Camk1 kinase. By
screening an HL-60 cDNA library using a neutrophil-derived protein
kinase-like clone as the probe, Haribabu et al. (1995) isolated a cDNA
encoding human CAMK1. The predicted 370-amino acid human CAMK1 protein
shares 97% amino acid identity with rat Camk1. Northern blot analysis
detected a widely expressed CAMK1 transcript of 1.5 kb.

GENE FUNCTION

Haribabu et al. (1995) found that a CAMK1 protein truncated at residue
306 was unable to bind calcium/calmodulin and lacked kinase activity,
whereas a CAMK1 protein truncated at residue 294 also did not bind
calcium/calmodulin but retained kinase activity even in the absence of
calcium/calmodulin. These results were consistent with essential
portions of the autoinhibitory and calcium/calmodulin-binding domains
encompassing residues 295 to 306 and residues C-terminal to 306,
respectively. By mutation analysis, the authors showed that CAMK1
requires thr177 for its phosphorylation. Furthermore, they found that
CAMK1 activity is enhanced by CAMK1 kinase in the presence of
calcium/calmodulin.

To determine how calcium/calmodulin activates CAMK1, Chin et al. (1997)
characterized CAMK1 activation by calmodulin mutants with substitutions
at hydrophobic residues. They found that CAMK1 activity is dependent on
met124 within the C-terminal domain of calmodulin as well as on
N-terminal hydrophobic residues of calmodulin.

Condon et al. (2002) investigated the calcium-dependent mechanism
regulating CYP11B2 (124080) transcription in a human adrenocortical cell
line using a reporter construct containing the 5-prime region of the
CYP11B2 gene. They found that CAMK and calmodulin inhibitors blocked
angiotensin II (160150)- and potassium-stimulated CYP11B2 reporter gene
expression. CAMK1 augmented reporter expression when cellular calcium
was elevated, but CAMK4 (114080) and CAMK2 (see 114078) had little or no
effect. A constitutively active CAMK1 mutant stimulated reporter
activity. Condon et al. (2002) concluded that CAMK1 is involved in
angiotensin II- and potassium-stimulated CYP11B2 transcription.

MAPPING

Haribabu et al. (1995) mapped the CAMK1 gene to chromosome 3 by somatic
cell hybrid analysis. Southern blot analysis predicted that CAMK1 is
present as a single gene.

162651	TITLE *162651 NEUROTENSIN RECEPTOR 1; NTSR1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The NTSR1 gene encodes a G protein-coupled receptor for neurotensin
(NTS; 162650), a short peptide that functions both as a neurotransmitter
and a hormone. NTSR1 signals preferentially through the Gq protein (see
GNAQ; 600998) to mediate most of the effects of NTS (summary by White et
al., 2012). See also NTSR2 (605538) and NTSR3 (SORT1; 602458).

CLONING

The tridecapeptide neurotensin (162650) is widely distributed in various
regions of the brain and in peripheral tissues. In the brain,
neurotensin acts as a neuromodulator, in particular of dopamine
transmission in the nigrostriatal and mesocorticolimbic systems,
suggesting its possible implication in dopamine-associated behavioral
neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. Its various effects
are mediated by specific membrane receptors. Vita et al. (1993) isolated
a cDNA encoding a human neurotensin receptor (NTSR1) and showed that it
predicts a 418-amino acid protein that shares 84% homology with the rat
protein.

Vincent (1995) reviewed pharmacologic and molecular data suggesting the
existence of other types of functional neurotensin receptors.

Le et al. (1997) cloned human NTSR1 cDNA and its genomic DNA. The
authors stated that the neurotensin receptor has 7 transmembrane
spanning regions and high homology to other receptors that couple to G
proteins.

GENE FUNCTION

Using RT-PCR, immunofluorescence microscopy, and flow cytometric
analysis, Saada et al. (2012) detected expression of NTS, NTSR1, NTSR2,
and NTSR3 in primary human B lymphocytes and human B-cell lines at
different stages of maturation. NTS exerted a proliferative and
antiapoptotic effect on B cells. Patients with chronic B-cell
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL; 151400) showed no expression of NTS and
increased expression of NTSR2. Saada et al. (2012) concluded that NTS
and its 2 specific receptors, NTSR1 and NTSR2, are expressed in human B
lymphocytes, as previously found for T cells, macrophages, and dendritic
cells, indicating that NTS may modulate immune responses and cell
interactions.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

White et al. (2012) presented the crystal structure at 2.8-angstrom
resolution of Rattus norvegicus NTSR1 in an active-like state, bound to
NTS(8-13), the carboxy-terminal portion of NTS responsible for
agonist-induced activation of the receptor. The peptide agonist binds to
NTSR1 in an extended conformation nearly perpendicular to the membrane
plane, with the C terminus oriented towards the receptor core.

GENE STRUCTURE

Le et al. (1997) determined that the NTSR1 gene contains 4 exons and
spans more than 10 kb. The authors identified a highly polymorphic
tetranucleotide repeat approximately 3 kb from the gene. Southern blot
analysis revealed that the NTSR1 gene is present in the human genome as
a single-copy gene.

MAPPING

Using fluorescence in situ hybridization with a human probe, Laurent et
al. (1994) mapped the human NTSR1 gene to 20q13. Using a radiolabeled
rat cDNA as a probe, they mapped the mouse neurotensin receptor gene to
the H region of chromosome 2.

603692	TITLE *603692 GALANIN RECEPTOR 3; GALR3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The neuropeptide galanin modulates a variety of physiologic processes
including cognition/memory, sensory/pain processing, hormone secretion,
and feeding behavior. The human galanin receptors GALR1 (600377) and
GALR2 (603691) are G protein-coupled receptors that functionally couple
to their intracellular effector through distinct signaling pathways.
GALR1 inhibits adenylyl cyclase via a G protein of the Gi/Go (see
139310) family, whereas GALR2 stimulates inositol phospholipid turnover
and intracellular calcium mobilization through a Gq/G11-type (see
600998) mechanism. By a combination of homology and expression cloning
strategies, Smith et al. (1998) isolated human and rat cDNAs encoding
GALR3, a novel galanin receptor.

Kolakowski et al. (1998) cloned genomic regions containing the GALR2 and
GALR3 genes. Sequence analysis indicated that the predicted 368-amino
acid human GALR3 protein shares 89%, 36%, and 58% identity with rat
GALR3, human GALR1, and human GALR2, respectively. GALR3 contains
features typical of G protein-coupled receptors, including the 7
transmembrane domains and aromatic amino acid triplet signature sequence
adjacent to transmembrane domain 3. Northern blot analysis revealed that
GALR3 is expressed as 1.4-, 2.4-, and 5-kb mRNAs in many human tissues.
Using mammalian cells expressing GALR3, Smith et al. (1998) found that
this receptor exhibits a pharmacologic profile similar to, but distinct
from, that of GALR1 and GALR2. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, human
and rat GALR3 coupled to a G protein of the Gi/Go class.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kolakowski et al. (1998) reported that the GALR3 gene contains a single
intron located at a splice site identical to that in GALR2.

MAPPING

By inclusion within mapped clones, Kolakowski et al. (1998) mapped the
GALR3 gene to chromosome 22. They refined the map position to
22q12.2-q13.1 using fluorescence in situ hybridization.

;;NKX6.1;;
NK HOMEOBOX, FAMILY 6, MEMBER A;;
HOMEOBOX 6A, NK; NKX6A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

In the pancreas, NKX6.1 is required for the development of beta cells
and is a potent bifunctional transcription regulator that binds to
AT-rich sequences within the promoter region of target genes Iype et al.
(2004).

CLONING

Homeobox genes encode a highly conserved DNA-binding domain that plays a
role in cell-specific differentiation and development. Inoue et al.
(1997) cloned the human NKX6A gene. It encodes a predicted 367-amino
acid protein that is 97% identical to the protein product of the
previously identified hamster NK homeobox gene, Nkx6.1 (Nkx6A), which is
expressed in pancreatic islet beta-cell lines.

GENE FUNCTION

Iype et al. (2004) identified a proximal beta cell-specific enhancer
(PBE) element in the NKX6.1 gene that is completely conserved between
rat, mouse, and human. The PBE is made up of an AT-containing sequence
flanked by GC-rich stretches. Mouse Nkx6.1 robustly activated
transcription through direct interaction with the AT-rich sequence in
this element. By electrophoretic mobility shift assay, Iype et al.
(2004) showed that Nkx6.1 bound the PBE in vitro, and by chromatin
immunoprecipitation assay, they showed that Nkx6.1 natively occupied
this region in vivo in a mouse beta-cell line. Mirmira et al. (2000)
demonstrated that when the enhancer region of target genes (e.g. INS;
(176730)) contains isolated or tandem TAAT or ATTA homeodomain binding
sites, Nkx6.1 directly binds to DNA and represses transcription through
interactions involving its N-terminal domain. By contrast, Iype et al.
(2004) showed that when a gene such as Nkx6.1 itself contains an ATTT
homeodomain binding site in the proximity of a GC-rich region, Nkx6.1
activates transcription through interactions involving an acidic
sequence within its C-terminal domain. Iype et al. (2004) concluded that
Nkx6.1 is a bifunctional transcription factor that maintains expression
of its own gene during beta-cell differentiation while simultaneously
effecting broader gene repression events.

Schisler et al. (2005) found that rat Nkx6.1 suppressed glucagon
expression and controlled glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in
pancreatic beta cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Inoue et al. (1997) found that the coding region of human NKX6.1 is
composed of 3 exons and spans approximately 4.8 kb.

MAPPING

Inoue et al. (1997) mapped the NKX6.1 gene to chromosome 4q21.2-q22 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

604694	TITLE *604694 A-KINASE ANCHOR PROTEIN 10; AKAP10
;;DUAL-SPECIFIC A KINASE-ANCHORING PROTEIN 2; DAKAP2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

A-kinase anchor proteins (AKAPs) direct the subcellular localization of
protein kinase A (PKA; see 176911) by binding to its regulatory (R)
subunits. Dual-specific AKAPs, such as AKAP10, interact with both RI
(see PRKAR1A; 188830) and RII (see PRKAR2B; 176912) (Wang et al., 2001).

CLONING

Using a 2-hybrid screen with the RET/PTC2 (188830) oncoprotein as bait,
Huang et al. (1997) isolated 3 cDNA fragments that associated
specifically with the RI portion of RET/PTC2. By screening a mouse
testis library with one of the fragments as a probe, they isolated a
full-length cDNA encoding Akap10, which they called Dakap2. The deduced
protein contains 372 amino acids. Sequence analysis revealed the
presence of a potential RGS (regulator of G protein signaling) motif.
Northern blot analysis detected expression of a 5-kb transcript in all
embryonic stages and in all adult tissues tested. A 10-kb transcript was
also expressed in brain, skeletal muscle, and testis. In testis, 3
smaller transcripts were also expressed. In situ hybridization analysis
showed that RI and AKAP10 were expressed in the same regions in the
testis.

By database analysis and PCR of a human brain cDNA library, Wang et al.
(2001) cloned DAKAP2. The deduced protein contains 662 amino acids, with
2 RGS domains and a C-terminal PKA-binding domain. The C-terminal 372
amino acids of DAKAP2, which contain the second RGS domain and the
PKA-binding domain, are 94% identical to the entire deduced mouse Dakap2
protein, suggesting that the previously cloned mouse cDNA is
N-terminally truncated. Semiquantitative PCR of human tissues detected a
single product expressed ubiquitously at variable levels. Western blot
analysis of mouse tissues detected several protein bands, with
reproducible tissue-specific expression. Dakap2 protein expression was
most abundant in brain, brown adipose tissue (BAT), heart, and pancreas.
Subcellular fractionation of mouse and rat BAT, as well as
immunocytochemical analysis of mouse and human cell lines and primary
rat cardiomyocyte cultures, showed DAKAP2 enriched in mitochondria.
Immunofluorescence microscopy of rat cerebellar slices found Dakap2
associated with only a subset of mitochondria, predominantly in Purkinje
cell soma, basket cells, and stellate cells. Labeling was weak or absent
in many mitochondria of Purkinje cell dendrites, parallel fibers,
climbing fibers of the molecular layer, and the granule cell layer.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a series of deletion mutants, Huang et al. (1997) determined that
the R-binding domain of mouse Dakap2, comprising residues 333 to 372 of
the C terminus, interacts with the N-terminal dimerization domain of
both RI and RII PKA.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wang et al. (2001) determined that the AKAP10 gene contains 15 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Wang et al. (2001) mapped the AKAP10 gene
to chromosome 17q.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Working on the assumption that the frequencies of disease susceptibility
alleles decrease in healthy elderly individuals in the general
population because of their contribution to disease morbidity and/or
mortality, Kammerer et al. (2003) compared allele frequencies of 6,500
SNPs located in approximately 5,000 genes between DNA pools of healthy,
age-stratified European Americans. They identified a 2073A-G SNP in exon
14 of the DAKAP2 gene, resulting in an ile646-to-val substitution in the
A-kinase-binding domain (I646V; 604694.0001), that showed the strongest
correlation with age (152430). Subsequent analysis of an independent
sample indicated that the val variant was associated with a
statistically significant decrease in the length of the
electrocardiogram PR interval. An in vitro binding assay revealed that
the ile variant bound approximately 3-fold weaker to the PKA RI-alpha
isoform than the val variant. This decreased affinity resulted in
alterations in the subcellular distribution of the recombinantly
expressed PKA RI-alpha isoform. Kammerer et al. (2003) concluded that
alterations in PKA RI-alpha subcellular localization caused by variation
in DAKAP2 may have a negative health prognosis in the aging population
that may be related to cardiac dysfunction, and that age-stratified
samples appeared to be useful for screening SNPs to identify functional
gene variants that have an impact on health.

Tingley et al. (2007) genotyped 122 individuals with stable coronary
heart disease for I646V and found the 646V variant to be associated with
markers of low vagus nerve sensitivity that predict an increased risk of
sudden cardiac death (see 115080).

ANIMAL MODEL

In cultured mouse cardiac myocytes derived from embryonic stem cells
bearing a heterozygous disruption of the Akap10 gene by a mutation that
eliminates the last 51 amino acids, including the PKA-binding domain,
Tingley et al. (2007) observed an increase in the contractile response
to cholinergic signals. Both heterozygous and homozygous mice derived
from these embryonic stem cells had an increased cardiac response to
cholinergic signals, suggesting a dominant interfering effect of the
Akap10 mutant allele. The Akap10 mutation shortened mouse life span in a
dose-dependent manner, with approximately 50% of homozygous and 25% of
heterozygous mice dying in the first year of life, apparently due to
cardiac arrhythmia as there was no overt illness and no sign of organ
histopathology.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CARDIAC CONDUCTION DEFECT, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
AKAP10, ILE646VAL

In a screen comparing allele frequencies of 6,500 SNPs located in
approximately 5,000 genes between samples of young and elderly European
Americans, Kammerer et al. (2003) identified a 2073A-G SNP in exon 14 of
the AKAP10 gene, resulting in an ile646-to-val (I646V) substitution. The
frequency of the SNP differed significantly between young and old
persons in both males (P = 0.03) and females (P = 0.009). There was no
significant difference between young males and females or between old
males and females. GG homozygotes were reduced and AA homozygotes were
increased in the older samples of both sexes, suggesting that the G
allele, which determines the val allele at I646V, is associated with a
negative impact on health and, therefore, longevity (152430).

Tingley et al. (2007) characterized the cardiac cycle and AKAP10 I646V
genotype of 122 participants in the Heart and Soul Study who had stable
coronary heart disease and found that the 646V variant was associated
with markers of low vagus nerve sensitivity, e.g., fast heart rate and
low heart rate variability; the authors noted that these markers predict
an increased risk of sudden cardiac death (see 115080).

600140	TITLE *600140 CREB-BINDING PROTEIN; CREBBP
;;CBP
CBP/MOZ FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

When cellular levels of cAMP increase, a cascade of events leads to the
induction of genes that contain cis-regulatory elements called
cAMP-response elements (CREs). Elevated cAMP levels cause stimulation
and nuclear translocation of protein kinase A (PKA; see 176911), which
activates the transcription factor CREB (CRE-binding protein; see
123810) by phosphorylating it at a single residue, serine-133 (Gonzalez
and Montminy, 1989).

Chrivia et al. (1993) reported the discovery of a nuclear
transcriptional coactivator protein, CREB-binding protein (CBP), that
binds specifically to the PKA-phosphorylated form of the CREB protein.
CBP is a large protein with a molecular mass of about 250 kD which
contains a bromodomain, i.e., a conserved structural unit important for
protein-protein interactions. In Drosophila and yeast, this domain is
found in coactivator proteins involved in signal-dependent, but not
basal, transcription (Nordheim, 1994).

To isolate the gene responsible for Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS1;
180849), which is associated with breakpoints in and microdeletions of
chromosome 16p13.3, Petrij et al. (1995) used FISH to situate all RSTS
breakpoints in an area of 150 kb, thus defining a candidate region.
Complementary DNAs from this area showed very high sequence homology
with mouse CBP. Further studies indicated that the human CBP gene spans
at least the 150-kb genomic area containing the RSTS breakpoints. Giles
et al. (1997) reported the cloning and sequencing of human CREBBP, which
encodes a deduced 2,442-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 265
kD with 95% homology to the mouse protein.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Liu et al. (2008) described a high resolution x-ray crystal structure of
a semisynthetic heterodimeric p300 (602700) HAT domain in complex with a
bisubstrate inhibitor, Lys-CoA. This structure showed that p300/CBP is a
distant cousin of other structurally characterized HATs, but revealed
several novel features that explain the broad substrate specificity and
preference for nearby basic residues. Based on this structure and
accompanying biochemical data, Liu et al. (2008) proposed that p300/CBP
uses an unusual hit-and-run (Theorell-Chance) catalytic mechanism that
is distinct from other characterized HATs. Several disease-associated
mutations could also be readily accounted for by the p300 HAT structure.

MAPPING

Petrij et al. (1995) used FISH to show that mouse CBP hybridized to
human 16p13.3. Chen and Korenberg (1995) also mapped CREBBP to 16p13.3
using a cDNA probe for the mouse gene in fluorescence in situ
hybridization. Using a human genomic clone for FISH, Wydner et al.
(1995) mapped CREBBP to 16p13.3-p13.2.

GENE FUNCTION

Kwok et al. (1994) used fluorescence anisotropy measurements to define
the equilibrium binding parameters of the phosphoCREB:CBP interaction
and reported that CBP can activate transcription through a region in its
C terminus. The activation domain of CBP interacts directly with the
basal transcription factor TFIIB (189963). As TFIIB interacts with the
TATA-box-binding protein TBP1 (186852), a continuous chain of physical
contacts is established linking the stimulus-activated phosphoCREB,
bound distal to the promoter, with the polymerase II complex that
initiates transcription (Nordheim, 1994). Acting as a coactivator, CBP
augments the activity of phosphorylated CREB to activate transcription
of cAMP-responsive genes.

Arias et al. (1994) microinjected an anti-CBP antiserum into fibroblasts
and determined that transcription from a cAMP promoter can be inhibited.
Arias et al. (1994) also reported that CBP cooperates with upstream
activators, such as JUN (165160), that are involved in
mitogen-responsive transcription. Studies indicated that when JUN was
phosphorylated at the transcriptionally stimulatory sites ser73 and
ser63, it bound CBP with comparable affinity to CREB. They proposed that
CBP is recruited to the promoter through interaction with certain
phosphorylated factors and that CBP may thus play a critical role in the
transmission of inductive signals from cell surface receptors to the
transcriptional apparatus.

Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs; e.g., 184756)
activate transcription of genes whose products are involved in the
cellular uptake and synthesis of cholesterol. Oliner et al. (1996)
showed that the putative activation domain of SREBP binds specifically
to the N-terminal domains of recombinant CBP and p300 (EP300; 602700), a
CREBBP-related protein. Transfection studies demonstrated that CBP
enhances the ability of SREBP to activate transcription of reporter
genes in HeLa cells, thus suggesting that CBP may serve as a coactivator
for SREBP.

Weaver et al. (1998) identified CREBBP/EP300 and IRF3 (603734) as
components of DRAF1 (double-stranded RNA-activated factor-1), a positive
regulator of interferon-stimulated gene transcription that functions as
a direct response to viral infection.

Lin et al. (2001) identified a compactly folded 46-residue domain in CBP
and p300, the IRF3-binding domain (IBID), and determined its structure
by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. IBID has a helical framework
containing an apparently flexible polyglutamine loop that participates
in ligand binding. Spectroscopic data indicated that induced folding
accompanies association of IBID with its partners, which exhibit no
evident sequence similarities. IBID is an important contributor to
signal integration by CBP and p300.

CBP binds to the ser133 phosphorylated region of CREB via a domain
called KIX (Parker et al., 1996). The phosphorylated domain of CREB was
termed KID for kinase-inducible domain. Radhakrishnan et al. (1997) used
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to study the molecular
interactions of the KIX:KID domains of CBP and CREB, respectively. The
KIX domain of CBP comprises amino acid residues 586 to 666. The KID
domain of CREB comprises amino acid residues 101 to 160. The KID
undergoes a coil-to-helix folding transition upon binding to KIX,
forming 2 alpha helices. The amphipathic helix alpha-B of KID interacts
with a hydrophobic groove defined by helices alpha-1 and alpha-3 of KIX.
The other KID helix, alpha-A, contacts a different face of the alpha-3
helix. The phosphate group of the critical phosphoserine residue of KID
forms a hydrogen bond to the side chain of tyr658 of KIX. The structure
provides a model for interactions between other transactivation domains
and their targets.

Growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF; 131530) and insulin
(176730) regulate development and metabolism via genes containing both
POU homeodomain (PIT1; 173110) and phorbol ester (AP1, or JNK) response
elements. Although CBP functions as a coactivator on these elements, the
mechanism of transactivation was unclear. Zanger et al. (2001)
demonstrated that CBP is recruited to these elements only after it is
phosphorylated at ser436 by growth factor-dependent signaling pathways.
In contrast, p300, a protein closely related to CBP that lacks this
phosphorylation site, binds only weakly to the transcription complex and
in a growth factor-independent manner. A small region of CBP (amino
acids 312 to 440), which the authors termed the GF box, contains a
potent transactivation domain and mediates this effect. Direct
phosphorylation represents a novel mechanism controlling coactivator
recruitment to the transcription complex.

To determine the physiologic significance of the phosphorylation site at
ser436 of the CREBBP protein, Zhou et al. (2004) generated knockin mice
containing a ser436-to-ala mutation. They demonstrated both in vitro and
in vivo that the mutant CREBBP was aberrantly recruited to CREB protein,
resulting in inappropriate activation of gluconeogenesis in the fed
state and glucose intolerance resulting from increased hepatic glucose
production. Zhou et al. (2004) proposed that insulin signaling may
directly regulate many cAMP signaling pathways at the transcriptional
level by controlling CREBBP recruitment.

To elucidate the molecular basis of assembling the multiprotein
activation complex, Demarest et al. (2002) undertook a structural and
thermodynamic analysis of the interaction domains of CBP and the
activator for thyroid hormone and retinoid receptors (TRAM1; 601937).
Demarest et al. (2002) demonstrated that although the isolated domains
are intrinsically disordered, they combine with high affinity to form a
cooperatively folded helical heterodimer. The authors concluded that
their study uncovers a unique mechanism, which they termed 'synergistic
folding,' through which p160 coactivators recruit CBP to allow
transmission of the hormone signal to the transcriptional machinery.

Zhong et al. (2002) demonstrated that transcriptionally inactive nuclear
NFKB in resting cells consists of homodimers of either p65 (164014) or
p50 (164011) complexed with the histone deacetylase HDAC1 (601241). Only
the p50-HDAC1 complexes bound to DNA and suppressed NFKB-dependent gene
expression in unstimulated cells. Appropriate stimulation caused nuclear
localization of NFKB complexes containing phosphorylated p65 that
associated with CBP and displaced the p50-HDAC1 complexes. These results
demonstrated that phosphorylation of p65 determines whether it
associates with either CBP or HDAC1, ensuring that only p65 entering the
nucleus from cytoplasmic NFKB-IKB (164008) complexes can activate
transcription.

TDG (601423) initiates repair of G/T and G/U mismatches, commonly
associated with CpG islands, by removing thymine and uracil moieties.
Tini et al. (2002) reported that TDG associates with transcriptional
coactivators CBP and p300 (602700) and that the resulting complexes are
competent for both the excision step of repair and histone acetylation.
TDG stimulated CBP transcriptional activity in transfected cells and
reciprocally served as a substrate for CBP/p300 acetylation. This
acetylation triggered release of CBP from DNA ternary complexes and also
regulated recruitment of repair endonuclease APE (107748). These
observations revealed a potential regulatory role for protein
acetylation in base mismatch repair and a role for CBP/p300 in
maintaining genomic stability.

Huntington disease (HD; 143100) belongs to the CAG repeat family of
neurodegenerative diseases and is characterized by the presence of an
expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat in the huntingtin gene (HTT;
613004). PolyQ-expanded htt accumulates within large aggregates that are
found in various subcellular compartments, but are more often localized
within the nucleus. It has been suggested that the sequestration of
proteins essential to cell viability may be 1 mechanism that accounts
for toxicity generated by polyQ-expanded proteins. Nuclear inclusions
containing polyQ-expanded htt have been shown to recruit CREBBP. In a
hippocampal cell line, Jiang et al. (2003) found that toxicity within
individual cells induced by polyQ-expanded htt (as revealed by a TUNEL
assay) was associated with the localization of the mutant htt within
either nuclear or perinuclear aggregates. However, in addition to CREBBP
recruitment, CREBBP ubiquitylation and degradation were selectively
enhanced by polyQ-expanded htt. Jiang et al. (2003) concluded that
selected substrates may be directed to the
ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent protein degradation pathway in response
to polyQ-expanded htt within the nucleus.

Tsuda et al. (2003) found that SOX9 (608160) used CBP and p300 as
transcriptional coactivators. SOX9 bound CBP and p300 in vitro and in
vivo, and both coactivators enhanced SOX9-dependent COL2A1 (120140)
promoter activity. Disruption of the CBP-SOX9 complex inhibited COL2A1
mRNA expression and differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells into
chondrocytes.

Blobel et al. (1998) found that in mouse nonhematopoietic cells, Cbp
stimulated Gata1 (305371) transcriptional activity. Cbp and Gata1 also
coimmunoprecipitated from nuclear extracts of mouse erythroid cells.
Interaction mapping pinpointed the contact sites to the zinc finger
region of Gata1 and to the E1A-binding region of Cbp. Expression of
adenovirus E1A revealed that the interaction of Cbp with Gata1 in
erythroid cells affected differentiation and expression of endogenous
Gata1 target genes.

Turnell et al. (2005) showed that 2 anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome
(APC/C) components, APC5 (606948) and APC7 (606949), interact directly
with the coactivators CBP and p300 through protein-protein interaction
domains that are evolutionarily conserved in adenovirus E1A. This
interaction stimulates intrinsic CBP/p300 acetyltransferase activity and
potentiates CBP/p300-dependent transcription. Turnell et al. (2005) also
showed that APC5 and APC7 suppress E1A-mediated transformation in a
CBP/p300-dependent manner, indicating that these components of the APC/C
may be targeted during cellular transformation. Furthermore, Turnell et
al. (2005) established that CBP is required for APC/C function;
specifically, gene ablation of CBP by RNA-mediated interference markedly
reduces the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of the APC/C and the
progression of cells through mitosis. Taken together, Turnell et al.
(2005) concluded that their results define discrete roles for the
APC/C-CBP/p300 complexes in growth regulation.

Wang et al. (2008) showed that an RNA-binding protein, TLS (137070),
serves as a key transcriptional regulatory sensor of DNA damage signals
that, on the basis of its allosteric modulation by RNA, specifically
binds to and inhibits CBP and p300 histone acetyltransferase activities
on a repressed gene target, cyclin D1 (CCND1; 168461), in human cell
lines. Recruitment of TLS to the CCND1 promoter to cause gene-specific
repression is directed by single-stranded, low copy-number noncoding RNA
(ncRNA) transcripts tethered to the 5-prime regulatory regions of CCND1
that are induced in response to DNA damage signals. Wang et al. (2008)
suggested that signal-induced noncoding RNAs localized to regulatory
regions of transcription units can act cooperatively as selective
ligands, recruiting and modulating the activities of distinct classes of
RNA-binding coregulators in response to specific signals, providing an
unexpected noncoding RNA/RNA-binding protein-based strategy to integrate
transcriptional programs.

Das et al. (2009) demonstrated that the histone acetyltransferase CBP in
flies, and CBP and p300 in humans, acetylate histone H3 on lys56
(H3K56), whereas Drosophila sir2 and human SIRT1 (604479) and SIRT2
(604480) deacetylate H3K56 acetylation. The histone chaperones ASF1A
(609189) in humans and Asf1 in Drosophila are required for acetylation
of H3K56 in vivo, whereas the histone chaperone CAF1 (see 601245) in
humans and Caf1 in Drosophila are required for the incorporation of
histones bearing this mark into chromatin. Das et al. (2009) showed
that, in response to DNA damage, histones bearing acetylated K56 are
assembled into chromatin in Drosophila and human cells, forming foci
that colocalize with sites of DNA repair. Furthermore, acetylation of
H3K56 is increased in multiple types of cancer, correlating with
increased levels of ASF1A in these tumors. Das et al. (2009) concluded
that their identification of multiple proteins regulating the levels of
H3K56 acetylation in metazoans will allow future studies of this
critical and unique histone modification that couples chromatin assembly
to DNA synthesis, cell proliferation, and cancer.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Acute Myelogenous Leukemia

Petrij et al. (1995) noted a case of acute myeloid leukemia (601626)
type M5b reported by Wessels et al. (1991) that was associated with a
translocation t(8;16) whose breakpoint was located in the same region as
the breakpoints in Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome-1 (RSTS1; 180849) (see
below). Petrij et al. (1995) proposed that the translocation may have
joined CBP to an unknown gene on chromosome 8, leading to the
malignancy.

By positional cloning on chromosome 16, Borrow et al. (1996) implicated
the CREB-binding protein in the M4/M5 subtype of acute myeloid leukemia.
Borrow et al. (1996) also used positional cloning to identify a novel
gene at the chromosome 8 breakpoint, which they termed MOZ (601408) for
monocytic leukemia zinc finger protein.

Sobulo et al. (1997) stated that the recurring translocation
t(11;16)(q23;p13.3) has been observed only in cases of acute leukemia or
myelodysplasia secondary to therapy with drugs targeting DNA
topoisomerase II (126430). Sobulo et al. (1997) showed that in 2
patients the MLL gene was fused in-frame to a different exon of the
CREBBP gene, producing chimeric proteins containing the AT-hooks,
methyltransferase homology domain, and transcriptional repression domain
of MLL fused to the CREB-binding domain or to the bromodomain of CREBBP.
Both fusion products retained the histone acetyltransferase domain of
CREBBP and may lead to leukemia by promoting histone acetylation of
genomic regions targeted by the MLL AT-hooks, leading to transcriptional
deregulation via aberrant chromatin organization.

Panagopoulos et al. (2001) reported a novel t(10;16)(q22;p13)
chromosomal translocation in a childhood acute myelogenous leukemia
(AML-M5a) leading to a MORF (605880)-CBP chimera. RT-PCR experiments
yielded in-frame MORF-CBP and CBP-MORF fusion transcripts. Genomic
analyses revealed that the breaks were close to Alu elements in intron
16 of MORF and intron 2 of CBP and that duplications had occurred near
the breakpoints. The MORF-CBP protein retained the zinc fingers, 2
nuclear localization signals, the histone acetyltransferase (HAT)
domain, a portion of the acidic domain of MORF, and the CBP protein
downstream of codon 29. The part of CBP encoding the RARA-binding
domain, the CREB-binding domain, the 3 cys/his-rich regions, the
bromodomain, the HAT domain, and the glu-rich domains was present. In
the reciprocal CBP-MORF, part of the acidic domain and the C-terminal
ser- and met-rich regions of MORF may be driven by the CBP promoter.

The t(8;16)(p11;p13) translocation, which is strongly associated with
AML displaying monocytic differentiation, erythrophagocytosis by the
leukemic cells, and a poor response to chemotherapy, fuses the CBP gene
on chromosome 16p13 with the MOZ gene on chromosome 8p11. Panagopoulos
et al. (2003) sequenced the breakpoints in 4 t(8;16)-positive AML cases.
The breaks clustered in both CBP intron 2 and MOZ intron 16, and were
close to repetitive elements; in 1 case, an Alu-Alu junction for the
CBP/MOZ hybrid was identified. All 4 cases showed additional genomic
events (i.e., deletions, duplications, and insertions) in the breakpoint
regions in both the MOZ and CBP genes. Thus, the translocation did not
originate through a simple end-to-end fusion. The findings of multiple
breaks and rearrangements suggested the involvement of a damage repair
mechanism in the origin of this translocation.

- Rubinstein-Taybi Syndrome 1

Petrij et al. (1995) found that all the breakpoints and microdeletions
in Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome are located in 16p13.3, in a region
containing the CREBBP gene. They showed, furthermore, that RSTS results
not only from gross chromosomal rearrangements of 16p but also from
heterozygous point mutations in the CBP gene itself (see, e.g.,
600140.0001), suggesting that the loss of one functional copy of the CBP
gene underlies the developmental abnormalities in RSTS, and possibly the
propensity for malignancy and keloid formation. To search for mutations
in RSTS patients without rearrangements, Petrij et al. (1995) used the
protein truncation test. In 2 of 16 patients, a truncated protein
product was found; both patients, who had classic RSTS phenotype, had a
change of a glutamine codon to a stop codon (see 600140.0001 and
600140.0002).

Taine et al. (1998) found microdeletion of the RT1 probe (D16S237) in 3
of 30 French patients with RSTS. By pooling data from their study and
previous series, they found the cumulative frequency of the 16p13.3
microdeletion to be 11.9% (19 in 159). Most reported microdeletions of
the CREBBP gene in RSTS had been detected by FISH with a single cosmid
probe specific to the 3-prime region of the gene. To explore the
possibility that the rate of microdeletion-positive cases would be
greater if the entire gene were evaluated, Blough et al. (2000)
performed FISH on 66 patients with an established diagnosis of RSTS,
using a panel of 5 cosmids spanning the CREBBP gene. Five of the 66
patients had deletions by FISH (9%), consistent with those rates
reported in various series that ranged between 3% and 25%. The findings
of a partial 5-prime deletion and of interstitial deletions of the gene
added to the known spectrum of mutations and demonstrated the need for
evaluation of the entire CREBBP gene in RSTS patients. No phenotypic
differences between partial deletion, complete deletion, and nondeletion
patients were observed, supporting a haploinsufficiency model for this
disorder.

Petrij et al. (2000) reported diagnostic analysis of 194 patients with
RSTS. Of these, 86 had previously been reported. A total of 157
individuals were tested by FISH, 23 by protein truncation test, and 14
by both methods for microdeletions and truncating mutations in CBP.
Fourteen of 171 (8.2%) patients had microdeletions. Eighty-nine of the
171 were tested using 5 cosmid probes: RT1, RT100, RT102, RT191, RT203
and RT166. Eight microdeletions were found in this group, of which 4
were not deleted for RT1/RT100. Petrij et al. (2000) concluded that the
use of all 5 probes is essential to detect all microdeletions in
patients with clinical features of RSTS. The protein truncation test
revealed truncating mutations in 4 of 37 (10.8%) cases. Petrij et al.
(2000) concluded that microdeletions and truncating mutations in CBP
account for approximately 20% of mutations in individuals with the RSTS
phenotype.

Petrij et al. (2000) stated that the breakpoints of 6 translocations and
inversions described in RSTS patients clustered in a 13-kb intronic
region at the 5-prime end of the CBP gene and could theoretically result
only in proteins containing the extreme N-terminal region of
CREB-binding protein. Microdeletions had occurred more frequently, in
approximately 10% of cases. In contrast to the previous findings, Petrij
et al. (2000) showed that in one patient with a translocation
t(2;16)(q36.3;p13.3), the chromosome 16 breakpoint was located about 100
kb downstream of the previously identified breakpoint cluster. Fiber
FISH and Southern blot analysis were used in this determination. Western
blot analysis of extracts prepared from lymphoblasts showed both a
normal and an abnormal shorter protein lacking the C-terminal domain,
indicating expression of both the normal and the mutant allele. The
results suggested that the loss of C-terminal domains of the protein
product is sufficient to cause RSTS. Furthermore, the data indicated the
potential utility of Western blot analysis as an inexpensive and fast
approach for screening RSTS mutations.

Murata et al. (2001) analyzed the CBP gene in 16 RSTS patients. A
microdeletion was identified in 1 patient by FISH analysis;
heteroallelic mutations were identified in 5 patients. These included a
2-bp and an 11-bp deletion, a 14-bp insertion, and a missense mutation
resulting in an arg1378-to-pro substitution (600140.0003). This missense
mutation was introduced into the recombinant mouse CBP, where it
abolished the HAT activity of CBP and the ability of CBP to
transactivate CREB. The authors hypothesized that loss of HAT activity
of CBP may cause RSTS. They further speculated that treatment of RSTS
patients with histone deacetylase inhibitors might have beneficial
effects.

Among 63 patients with RSTS, Coupry et al. (2002) used several molecular
techniques, including cDNA probes to search for gross gene
rearrangements, intragenic microsatellite markers, and PCR with direct
sequencing, to identify 22 novel point mutations in the CBP gene. In 33
patients, no abnormality in the CBP gene was detected.

Kalkhoven et al. (2003) performed mutational analysis in 39 RSTS
patients and identified 8 heterozygous mutations in the HAT domain of
CBP, one of which altered a conserved plant homeodomain (PHD) zinc
finger amino acid (E1278K; 600140.0006), while a second deleted exon 22
(600140.0007), which encodes the central region of the PHD finger.
Functional analysis revealed that these PHD finger mutants lacked in
vitro acetyltransferase activity towards histones and CBP itself and
displayed reduced coactivator function for the transcription factor
CREB. In EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cells from the exon 22 deletion
patient, there was 50% less endogenous CBP HAT activity. The authors
stressed the functional importance of the PHD finger in vivo, and
implied that reduction of CBP HAT activity, as exemplified by disruption
of the PHD finger, may be sufficient to cause RSTS.

In 6 (28.6%) of 21 RSTS patients in whom no point mutations had been
identified, Stef et al. (2007) used comparative genomic hybridization on
microarrays and quantitative multiplex fluorescent-PCR to identify
deletions involving the CREBBP gene. The deletions ranged in size from
3.3 kb to 6.5 Mb; 1 patient had a deleterious duplication containing
exon 16. No phenotypic differences were observed, except for 1 patient
with a 6.5-Mb deletion, who had a severe phenotype and died at 34 days
of life. Stef et al. (2007) concluded that CREBBP dosage anomalies
constitute a common cause of the disorder and recommended
high-resolution gene dosage studies of the CREBBP gene in candidate
patients.

Gervasini et al. (2007) used FISH and microsatellite analysis to screen
42 Italian RSTS patients and identified deletions involving the CREBBP
gene that ranged in size from 150 kb to 2.6 Mb in 6 patients. Three of
the patients were low-level mosaics, with the deletion present in less
than 30% of lymphoctyes and in less than 20% of epithelial cells
analyzed. The authors noted that, despite the small number of deleted
cells in the investigated tissues, the clinical phenotype of the mosaic
patients was quite typical, thus emphasizing the dose sensitivity of
CREBBP.

- Spinal and Bulbar Muscular Atrophy

Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA; 313200) is an inherited
neurodegenerative disease caused by CAG repeat expansion within the gene
encoding the androgen receptor (AR; 313700). The expansion results in an
expanded polyglutamine tract, which likely confers a novel, toxic
function to the affected protein. Cell culture and transgenic mouse
studies have implicated the nucleus as a site for pathogenesis,
suggesting that a critical nuclear factor or process may be disrupted by
the polyglutamine expansion. McCampbell et al. (2000) demonstrated that
CREB-binding protein is incorporated into nuclear inclusions formed by
polyglutamine-containing proteins in cultured cells, transgenic mice,
and tissue from patients with SBMA. Soluble levels of CREB-binding
protein were reduced in cells expressing expanded polyglutamine despite
increased levels of CBP mRNA. Overexpression of CREBBP rescued cells
from polyglutamine-mediated toxicity in neuronal cell culture. The
authors proposed a CREBBP-sequestration model of polyglutamine expansion
disease.

- Chromosome 16p13.3 Duplication Syndrome

Thienpont et al. (2010) reported 12 unrelated patients with mild to
moderate mental retardation and mild skeletal anomalies associated with
interstitial duplication of chromosome 16p13.3 (613458). Ten of the 12
duplications occurred de novo, and 2 were inherited from unaffected
parents. The duplications ranged in size, but the smallest region of
overlap was 186 to 260 kb in size and included the CREBBP gene. None of
the breakpoints were recurrent, arguing against nonallelic homologous
recombination as a mechanism. The findings indicated that CREBBP is
dosage-sensitive. Thienpont et al. (2010) estimated the frequency of
CREBBP duplication to be 1 in 97,000 to 146,000 live births.

- Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma

Pasqualucci et al. (2011) reported that the 2 most common types of B
cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (605027), follicular lymphoma and diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma, harbor frequent structural alterations
inactivating CREBBP and, more rarely, EP300 (602700), 2 highly related
histone and nonhistone acetyltransferases (HATs) that act as
transcriptional coactivators in multiple signaling pathways. Overall,
about 39% of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and 41% of follicular
lymphoma cases display genomic deletions and/or somatic mutations that
remove or inactivate the HAT coding domain of these 2 genes. These
lesions usually affect 1 allele, suggesting that reduction in HAT dosage
is important for lymphomagenesis. Pasqualucci et al. (2011) demonstrated
specific defects in acetylation-mediated inactivation of the BCL6
oncoprotein (109565) and activation of the p53 tumor suppressor
(191170).

- Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia

Mullighan et al. (2011) found that 18.3% of relapse cases of acute
lymphoblastic leukemia had sequence or deletion mutations in CREBBP and
that these frequently occurred in the histone acetyltransferase domain.

EVOLUTION

While mapping and cloning the human CREBBP gene on 16p13.3, Giles et al.
(1997) noticed an emerging pattern of relationship between this
chromosome band and a region of chromosome 22q. CBP exhibits extensive
homology to the adenovirus E1A-associated protein p300, whose gene
(EP300; 602700) maps to 22q13 (Eckner et al., 1994; Lundblad et al.,
1995). They noted that the heme oxygenase-1 gene (HMOX1; 141250) maps to
22q12 and the heme oxygenase-2 gene (HMOX2; 141251) to 16p13.3
Furthermore, the gene for phosphomannomutase-2 (PMM2; 601785) is on
16p13 and that for phosphomannomutase-1 (PMM1; 601786) is on 22q13.
Sequence comparison at the amino acid level revealed that homology
between these paralogous proteins is high: 63% between CBP and p300, 66%
between PMM1 and PMM2, and 74% between HMOX1 and HMOX2. By examination
of genome databases, e.g., OMIM, Giles et al. (1998) found 6 additional
sets of paralogs mapping to 16p13 and 22q11-q13, although the extent of
homology between these paralogous sets was not known. These pairs were
SSTR5 (182455) and SSTR3 (182453) on 16 and 22, respectively; CSNK2A2
(115442) and CSNK1E (600863); UBE2I (601661) and UB2L3; MYH11 (160745)
and MYH9 (160775); CRYM (123740) and a cluster of crystallin genes on
chromosome 22, e.g., CRYBB1 (600929); IL4RA (147781) and IL2RB (146710).
Giles et al. (1998) postulated that these bands show homology because of
an ancestral event of the type proposed by Ohno (1993). Arguing from the
fact that chromosome 14q carries SSTR1 (182451), UBE2L1 (600012), MYH6
(160710), and MYH7 (160760), whereas SSTR2 (182452), CSNK1D (600864),
and CRYBA1 (123610) map to 17q, combined with the location on leukemia
breakpoints, strongly suggested to Giles et al. (1998) that these gene
families arose by tetraploidization resulting in members on 14q, 16p,
17q, and 22q. Genetic redundancy is potentially of great relevance to
organismal evolution since it may protect against potentially harmful
mutations and may provide a pool of diverse yet functionally similar
proteins for further evolution.

ANIMAL MODEL

Tanaka et al. (1997) generated Cbp +/- mice with haploinsufficiency of
the Cbp protein, as demonstrated by Western blot analysis. Many of the
mutant mice exhibited abnormal skeletal patterning similar to some
features found in Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, including delayed
ossification of the frontal bones, enlarged anterior fontanels, and
various anomalies of the sternum, rib cage, xiphoid process, and
vertebrae. The mutant mice also had decreased levels of bone
morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP7; 112267), a molecule believed to be part
of the signaling cascade in skeletal development. Tanaka et al. (1997)
found that mice homozygous for the mutation died in utero.

Kung et al. (2000) showed that Cbp +/- mice display an increased cancer
risk similar to that seen in patients with RSTS. These results provided
experimental evidence that CBP has tumor suppressing activity.

To identify the physiologic functions of the Cbp protein using a
loss-of-function mutant, Yamauchi et al. (2002) analyzed Cbp-deficient
mice. As Crebbp-null mice died during embryogenesis, they used
heterozygous mice. Unexpectedly, Crebbp +/- mice showed markedly reduced
weight of white adipose tissue but not of other tissues. Despite this
lipodystrophy, Crebbp +/- mice showed increased insulin sensitivity and
glucose tolerance and were completely protected from body weight gain
induced by high-fat diet. They observed increased leptin sensitivity and
increased serum adiponectin (605441) levels in Crebbp +/- mice. These
increased effects of insulin-sensitizing hormones secreted from white
adipose tissue may explain, at least in part, the phenotypes of Crebbp
+/- mice. The study demonstrated that CBP may function as a
'master-switch' between energy storage and expenditure.

Kasper et al. (2002) demonstrated that the protein-binding KIX domains
of CBP and p300 (602700) have nonredundant functions in mice. In mice
homozygous for point mutations in the KIX domain of p300 designed to
disrupt the binding surface for the transcription factors c-Myb (189990)
and Creb, multilineage defects occur in hematopoiesis, including anemia,
B-cell deficiency, thymic hypoplasia, megakaryocytosis, and
thrombocytosis. By contrast, age-matched mice homozygous for identical
mutations in the KIX domain of CBP are essentially normal. There is a
synergistic genetic interaction between mutations in c-MYB and mutations
in the KIX domain of p300, which suggests that the binding of c-MYB to
this domain of p300 is crucial for the development and function of
megakaryocytes. Thus, Kasper et al. (2002) concluded that conserved
domains in 2 highly related coactivators have contrasting roles in
hematopoiesis.

Bourtchouladze et al. (2003) reasoned that drugs that modulate CREB
function by enhancing cAMP signaling might yield an effective treatment
for the memory defect of CBP +/- mice. To this end, they designed a
cell-based drug screen and discovered inhibitors of phosphodiesterase-4
(see 600126, for example) to be particularly effective enhancers of CREB
function. They extended previous behavioral observations by showing that
CBP +/- mutants have impaired long-term memory but normal learning and
short-term memory in an objective recognition task. They demonstrated
that the prototypic PDE4 inhibitor, rolipram, and a novel one (HT0712)
abolish the long-term memory defect of CBP +/- mice. The genetic lesion
in CBP acts specifically to shift the dose sensitivity for HT0712 to
enhance memory formation, which conveys molecular specificity on the
drug's mechanism of action. The results suggested that PDE4 inhibitors
might be used to treat the cognitive dysfunction of RSTS patients.

Alarcon et al. (2004) found that transgenic mice haploinsufficient for
the Cbp protein exhibited normal activity, motivation, anxiety, and
working short-term memory, but had reduced long-term memory for fear and
object recognition. Electrophysiologic measurements showed that the
mutant mice had normal basal synaptic transmission, but had a defect in
the late phase of hippocampal long-term potentiation that is dependent
on transcriptional activation. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot
analysis showed that the Cbp +/- mice had decreased acetylation of
histone H2B (see 609904), indicating an alteration in chromatin. Both
enhancement of the expression of CREB-dependent genes and inhibition of
histone deacetylation ameliorated the long-term potentiation and memory
defects. Alarcon et al. (2004) concluded that some of the cognitive
deficits in RTS may result from the continued requirement throughout
life for both functions of CBP: activation of CREB and histone
acetylation with chromatin remodeling.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RUBINSTEIN-TAYBI SYNDROME 1
CREBBP, GLN136TER

In a patient with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome-1 (RSTS1; 180849), Petrij et
al. (1995) identified a C-T transition in the CREBBP gene, resulting in
a stop codon and a truncated protein product.

.0002
RUBINSTEIN-TAYBI SYNDROME 1
CREBBP, GLN357TER

In a patient with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome-1 (RSTS1; 180849), Petrij et
al. (1995) identified a C-T transition in the CREBBP gene, resulting in
a stop codon and a truncated protein product. In this patient, the
mutation destroyed a PvuII restriction site. Since the site was found to
be intact in both chromosomes of the parents, the mutation in the
patient must have been de novo.

.0003
RUBINSTEIN-TAYBI SYNDROME 1
CREBBP, ARG1378PRO

In a patient with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome-1 (180849), Murata et al.
(2001) demonstrated a G-C transversion in the CREBBP gene, resulting in
an arg1378-to-pro (R1378P) substitution. In a transgenic mouse model,
this mutation abolished HAT activity of the CREB-binding protein.

.0004
RUBINSTEIN-TAYBI SYNDROME 1
CREBBP, 2-BP DEL, NT5222

In a patient with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome-1 (180849), Murata et al.
(2001) demonstrated a 2-bp deletion in the CREBBP gene of nucleotides
5222-5223, leading to missense translation from codons 1469-1476,
followed by premature termination at codon 1477.

.0005
RUBINSTEIN-TAYBI SYNDROME 1, INCOMPLETE
CREBBP, TYR1175CYS

In a patient with a mild form of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome-1 (180849),
Bartsch et al. (2002) identified a 3524A-G transition in the CREBBP
gene, resulting in a tyr1175-to-cys (Y1175C) substitution. The authors
concluded that the missense mutation resulted in the milder phenotype.

.0006
RUBINSTEIN-TAYBI SYNDROME 1
CREBBP, GLU1278LYS

In a patient with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome-1 (180849), Kalkhoven et al.
(2003) identified a 3832G-A transition in the CREBBP gene, resulting in
a glu1278-to-lys (E1278K) substitution at a conserved residue within the
PHD finger of the HAT domain.

.0007
RUBINSTEIN-TAYBI SYNDROME 1
CREBBP, IVS21, A-T, -2

In a patient with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome-1 (180849), Kalkhoven et al.
(2003) identified an A-to-T transversion 2 bp 5-prime to exon 22 in the
CREBBP gene. The mutation was predicted to result in aberrant splicing
and loss of the 26 amino acids encoded by exon 22. These residues lie in
the middle of the PHD finger of the HAT domain. Expression studies
revealed loss of HAT activity in transiently transfected cells.

.0008
RUBINSTEIN-TAYBI SYNDROME 1, INCOMPLETE
CREBBP, THR910ALA

In a girl, her mother, and maternal grandmother with an incomplete form
of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome-1 (180849), Bartsch et al. (2010)
identified a heterozygous 2728A-G transition in exon 14 of the CREBBP
gene, resulting in a thr910-to-ala (T910A) substitution in a partially
conserved residue. The mutation occurred outside the crucial histone
acetyltransferase domain, which could explain the milder phenotype. The
12-year-old female proband had mild dysmorphic features, such as
high-arched eyebrows, elongated face, prominent nose, high-arched
palate, short broad thumbs, and broad halluces. She had a short
attention span, dyslexia, dyscalculia, reading difficulties, and needed
specal teaching in language and mathematics. Her mother had similar
facial features, was mildly obese, and had normal intelligence. The
grandmother reportedly had a similar appearance and had not finished
school. The report confirmed autosomal dominant inheritance of the
disorder.

602026	TITLE *602026 PHYTANOYL-CoA HYDROXYLASE; PHYH
;;PAHX;;
LNAP1, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The PHYH gene encodes phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase, a peroxisomal protein
that catalyzes the first step in the alpha-oxidation of phytanic acid, a
branched-chain fatty acid. Because beta-oxidation is blocked by the
methyl group at C-3, phytanic acid must first undergo decarboxylation
via an alpha-oxidation mechanism catalyzed by PHYH (Jansen et al.,
1997).

CLONING

The gene encoding the PHYH enzyme was identified by Mihalik et al.
(1997) starting from studies of peroxisomal genes and gene defects in
yeast and independently by Jansen et al. (1997) working back from the
partial amino acid sequence of the purified rat protein. Both groups
made use of expressed sequence tag (EST) database searching for
identification of the full-length human cDNA sequence. The open reading
frame encodes a 41.2-kD protein of 338 amino acids, which contains a
cleavable peroxisomal targeting signal type 2 (PTS2).

GENE STRUCTURE

Jansen et al. (2000) determined that the PHYH gene spans approximately
21 kb and contains 9 exons.

MAPPING

Radiation hybrid data studies by Mihalik et al. (1997) placed the PAHX
gene on chromosome 10 between markers D10S249 and D10S466.

GENE FUNCTION

The structure and subcellular localization of the phytanic acid
alpha-oxidation pathway long remained enigmatic, although it was
generally assumed to involve phytanic acid and not its CoA-ester.
However, this view was challenged by the finding in rat liver that
phytanic acid must first be activated to its CoA ester, phytanoyl-CoA,
before it can be oxidized (Watkins et al., 1994).

Mihalik et al. (1995) identified an enzyme activity (phytanoyl-CoA
hydroxylase) in rat-liver peroxisomes by which phytanoyl-CoA is
converted to 2-hydroxyphytanoyl-CoA. Jansen et al. (1996) showed that
phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase is present in human liver. Furthermore, they
showed that it is located in peroxisomes and is deficient in liver from
Zellweger syndrome (see 214100) patients, who lack morphologically
distinguishable peroxisomes, providing an explanation for the long-known
deficient oxidation of phytanic acid in these patients. They also showed
that phytanic acid alpha-oxidation is peroxisomal and that it utilizes
the CoA derivative as substrate, thus giving support in favor of the
revised pathway of phytanic acid alpha-oxidation.

Mihalik et al. (1997) found that human PAHX is targeted to peroxisomes,
requires the PTS2 receptor PEX7 (601757) for peroxisomal localization,
interacts with the PTS2 receptor in the yeast 2-hybrid assay, and has
intrinsic phytanoyl-CoA alpha-hydroxylase activity that requires the
dioxygenase cofactor iron and cosubstrate 2-oxoglutarate.

Using the yeast 2-hybrid system to investigate the physiologic function
of FKBP52 (600611), Chambraud et al. (1999) found that PAHX is an
FKBP-associated protein. They found, furthermore, that the protein
corresponds to the mouse protein Lnap1, which, based on studies of the
MRL/lpr mouse, may be involved in the progression of lupus nephritis
(Iwano et al., 1996). Chambraud et al. (1999) suggested that PAHX is a
serious candidate for studying the cellular signaling pathway(s)
involving FKBP52 in the presence of immunosuppressant drugs.

McDonough et al. (2005) stated that both the pro and mature forms of
human PAHX are enzymatically active and show similar substrate
specificity.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

McDonough et al. (2005) solved the x-ray crystallographic structure of
human PAHX complexed with Fe(2+) and 2-oxoglutarate to 2.5-angstrom
resolution. PAHX has a double-stranded beta-helix core with 3
iron-binding residues, his175, asp177, and his264. The 2-oxoacid group
of 2-oxoglutarate binds to Fe(2+) in a bidentate manner. Cys191 is
positioned 6.7-angstrom from Fe(2+), and his155 and his281 form part of
the active site. Of the 15 PAHX residues mutated in Refsum disease
(266500) patients, 11 cluster in 2 distinct groups around the binding
sites for Fe(2+) (e.g., gln176; see 602026.0007) and 2-oxoglutarate
(e.g., gly204; see 602026.0008).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Mihalik et al. (1997) and Jansen et al. (1997) identified homozygous or
compound heterozygous mutations in the PHYH gene
(602026.0001-602026.0004) in a total of 7 patients with Refsum disease
(266500).

In 22 patients with Refsum disease, Jansen et al. (2000) identified
mutations in the PHYH gene, including 14 different missense mutations, a
3-bp insertion, and a 1-bp deletion, which were all confirmed at the
genome level. A 111-bp deletion identified in the PHYH cDNA of several
patients with Refsum disease was due to either 1 of 2 different
mutations in the same splice acceptor site, which result in skipping of
exon 3. Six mutations were expressed in S. cerevisiae, and all led to an
enzymatically inactive PhyH protein.

Mukherji et al. (2001) relied on crystallographic data for other members
of the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenase superfamily to generate
secondary structural predictions for the PHYH gene, which were tested by
site-directed mutagenesis. Constructed H175A and D177A mutants did not
catalyze hydroxylation of phytanoyl-CoA, consistent with the assigned
role of these residues as iron(II) binding ligands. The clinically
observed mutations pro29 to ser (P29S; 602026.0006), gln176 to lys
(Q176K; 602026.0007), gly204 to ser (G204S; 602026.0008), asn269 to his
(N269H; 602026.0004), arg275 to gln (R275Q; 602026.0009), and arg275 to
trp (R275W; 602026.0001) were assayed for both 2-oxoglutarate and
phytanoyl-CoA oxidation. The P29S mutant was fully active, implying that
the mutation may result in defective targeting of the protein to
peroxisomes. Mutation of arg275 resulted in impaired 2-oxoglutarate
binding. The Q176K, G204S, and N269H mutations caused partial uncoupling
of 2-oxoglutarate conversion from phytanoyl-CoA oxidation. The authors
cautioned that the diagnosis of Refsum disease should not solely rely
upon PHYH assays for 2-oxoglutarate or phytanoyl-CoA oxidation.

Jansen et al. (2004) reviewed mutations in the PHYH gene causing Refsum
disease.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
REFSUM DISEASE, ADULT, 1
PHYH, ARG275TRP

In a Ukrainian patient with Refsum disease (266500), whose parents
originated from the same region, Mihalik et al. (1997) identified a
homozygous 823C-T transition in the PHYH gene, predicted to result in an
arg275-to-trp (R275W) amino acid substitution. The mutation also
eliminated a unique BspEI restriction site. The arginine-275 residue is
conserved in both the mouse and the C. elegans forms of the protein. In
vitro functional expression studies showed that the mutant enzyme was
inactive.

Jansen et al. (2000) expressed the mutant R275W allele in S. cerevisiae
and determined that no enzymatic activity was present.

.0002
REFSUM DISEASE, ADULT, 1
PHYH, IVS2AS, A-G, -2

In a patient with Refsum disease (266500), Mihalik et al. (1997)
discovered a truncated form of PHYH mRNA lacking 111 nucleotides of the
open reading frame (residues 158-269 of the cDNA sequence), deleting
codons 46-82. (Jansen et al. (1997) stated that this nucleotide
numbering was incorrect; see below.) Sequence analysis of genomic DNA
spanning this region of the gene revealed the absence of a single exon
in the cDNA. An A-to-G transition was found at the penultimate residue
of the upstream intron, altering the consensus splice acceptor sequence
of AG to GG. The patient was homozygous for the mutation.

In 3 unrelated patients with Refsum disease, Jansen et al. (1997)
observed a 111-bp deletion covering residues 135 to 246 of their PHYH
cDNA. The deletion did not cause a frameshift, but resulted in a protein
lacking 37 internal amino acids (Y46-R82del) that was presumed to be
enzymatically inactive. The deletion was thought to be the result of the
missplicing and skipping of 1 or more exons, as analysis of the putative
exon boundaries showed a perfect match with the 5-prime exon boundary
consensus. The deletion was homozygous in 2 patients and present in
compound heterozygous state in the third.

.0003
REFSUM DISEASE, ADULT, 1
PHYH, 1-BP DEL, 164T

In a brother and sister with Refsum disease (266500) born to healthy
first-cousin Pakistani parents, Jansen et al. (1997) identified a
homozygous deletion of nucleotide 164T in the PHYH gene, leading to a
frameshift and a premature stop codon after amino acid 66. The first
manifestation in the sister was nystagmus at the age of 6 months. Night
blindness and retinitis pigmentosa were found at the age of 8 years. At
the age of 10 years, she had ataxia, deafness, ichthyosis, and short
metacarpal bones, as well as peripheral neuropathy but normal
intellectual performance. Plasma phytanic acid level was elevated. The
brother showed elevated plasma phytanic acid when first measured at 7
weeks. He was placed on a low phytanic acid diet with vitamin C
supplement. His development was good and he appeared to see well.
Although the appearance of his retina was normal, visual evoked
responses were delayed and ERG response was poor.

.0004
REFSUM DISEASE, ADULT, 1
PHYH, ASN269HIS

In a Caucasian male with Refsum disease (266500) reported by Skjeldal et
al. (1987), Jansen et al. (1997) identified a heterozygous 805A-C
transition in the PHYH gene, resulting in an asn269-to-his (N269H)
substitution. The patient was a compound heterozygote for this missense
mutation and for a 111-bp deletion (602026.0002), which was observed in
2 other unrelated patients.

.0005
REFSUM DISEASE, ADULT, 1
PHYH, 3-BP INS, 576GCC

In 2 sibs with Refsum disease (266500), Jansen et al. (2000)
demonstrated homozygosity for a 3-bp insertion (576insGCC) in exon 6 of
the PHYH gene, resulting in addition of an alanine residue after amino
acid 192.

.0006
RECLASSIFIED - PHYTANOYL-CoA HYDROXYLASE POLYMORPHISM (dbSNP rs28938169)
PHYH, PRO29SER

This variant, formerly titled REFSUM DISEASE, ADULT, 1, has been
reclassified as a polymorphism. As of December 2012, the pro29-to-ser
(P29S) variant had an overall population frequency of 20% (Exome Variant
Server, 2012). In addition, the patients reported by Jansen et al.
(2000) with this mutation had additional mutations in the PHYH gene that
may have been causative and the P29S mutant was found to be fully
active.

In 2 patients with Refsum disease (266500), Jansen et al. (2000) found
an 85C-T transition in the PHYH gene, leading to a P29S substitution.
The patients also had a truncating mutation (602026.0002) and either
589G-C or 648C-T leading to missense mutations E197Q or H220Y,
respectively.

.0007
REFSUM DISEASE, ADULT, 1
PHYH, GLN176LYS

In the cDNA of a patient with Refsum disease (266500), Jansen et al.
(2000) described a 526C-A transversion in the PHYH gene, leading to a
gln176-to-lys (Q176K) substitution.

.0008
REFSUM DISEASE, ADULT, 1
PHYH, GLY204SER

In the cDNA of a patient with Refsum disease (266500), Jansen et al.
(2000) described a 610G-A transition in the PHYH gene, leading to a
gly204-to-ser (G204S) substitution.

.0009
REFSUM DISEASE, ADULT, 1
PHYH, ARG275GLN

In the cDNA of patients with Refsum disease (266500), Jansen et al.
(2000) described an 824G-A transition in the PHYH gene, leading to an
arg275-to-gln (R275Q) mutation.

613634	TITLE *613634 DENN/MADD DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1C; DENND1C
;;CONNECDENN 3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Clathrin (see 118955)-mediated endocytosis is a major mechanism for
internalization of proteins and lipids. Members of the connecdenn
family, such as DENND1C, function as guanine nucleotide exchange factors
(GEFs) for the early endosomal small GTPase RAB35 (604199) and bind to
clathrin and clathrin adaptor protein-2 (AP2; see 601024). Thus,
connecdenns link RAB35 activation with the clathrin machinery (Marat and
McPherson, 2010).

CLONING

By searching a database for sequences similar to connecdenn-1 (DENND1A;
613633), Marat and McPherson (2010) identified human DENND1B (613292)
and DENND1C, which they designated connecdenn-2 and -3, respectively.
The deduced 801-amino acid connecdenn-3 protein contains an N-terminal
DENN domain with 3 DENN modules and C-terminal motifs for binding to the
alpha ear of AP2 and to clathrin heavy chain (CLTC; 118955).
Connecdenn-3 shares 32% amino acid identity with connecdenn-1. Western
blot analysis showed that rat connecdenn-3 was ubiquitously expressed,
with highest expression in brain.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a protein pull-down assay with rat brain lysates, Marat and
McPherson (2010) showed that connecdenn-1, -2, and -3 bound the terminal
domain of clathrin heavy chain. All 3 connecdenns bound AP2, but
mutation analysis revealed that they used different AP2-binding motifs.
The isolated DENN domains of connecdenn-1 and -2 bound the GDP-bound
form of RAB35, whereas the DENN domain of connecdenn-3 did not bind
RAB35. However, all 3 connecdenns functioned as GEFs for RAB35. All 3
connecdenns also copurified with rat brain clathrin-coated vesicles,
although connecdenn-2 and -3 also showed a substantial cytosolic pool.
Knockdown of connecdenn-1 or -2 or Rab35 in COS-7 cells resulted in
perinuclear clustering and enlargement of early endosomes.

MAPPING

Marat and McPherson (2010) stated that the DENND1C gene maps to
chromosome 19p13.3.

;;TRINUCLEOTIDE REPEAT-CONTAINING GENE 5; TNRC5;;
PROTEIN ASSOCIATED WITH TOLL-LIKE RECEPTOR 4, A; PRAT4A;;
PROTEIN ASSOCIATED WITH TLR4, A;;
EXPANDED REPEAT DOMAIN, CAG/CTG, 5; ERDA5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PRAT4A is associated with the immature form of TLR4 (603030) and
regulates its cell surface expression (Wakabayashi et al., 2006).

CLONING

By immunoprecipitation analysis of an embryonic kidney cell line,
Wakabayashi et al. (2006) identified TNRC5, which they called PRAT4A, as
a 40-kD protein that coprecipitated with TLR4 and MD2 (605243). The
278-amino acid PRAT4A protein has a 37-amino acid N-terminal signal
sequence, a canonical N-glycosylation site, and 6 cys residues. It
shares significant homology with mouse Prat4a and human PRAT4B (610047).
Northern blot analysis detected Prat4a expression in all mouse tissues
examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Using RNA interference in human and mouse cell lines, Wakabayashi et al.
(2006) demonstrated that knockdown of PRAT4A diminished TLR4/MD2
expression, as well as lipopolysaccharide responsiveness. Human PRAT4A
bound hypoglycosylated mouse Tlr4 with or without Md2, but it did not
bind mature Tlr4/Md2, in human and mouse cells. Wakabayashi et al.
(2006) proposed that PRAT4A has a role in TLR4 maturation and
glycosylation.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the CNPY3
gene to chromosome 6 (TMAP RH18283).

601209	TITLE *601209 POLY(rC)-BINDING PROTEIN 1; PCBP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Leffers et al. (1995) described the cloning and characterization of 2
cDNAs for poly(rC)-binding proteins, called PCBP1 and PCBP2 (601210) by
them. The authors analyzed an EST database for sequences that were
predicted to encode a protein with K-homologous (KH) domains. The 60- to
70-amino acid KH motifs are found in several putative nucleic acid
binding proteins such as FMR1 (309550) and HNRNPK (600712) and are
thought to be involved in RNA binding. Using primers from 1 EST the
authors produced a probe that was used to screen a cDNA library of
transformed human amnion cells. The cDNA they isolated for PCBP1 encodes
a putative 356-amino acid protein that contains 3 KH domains. It is 83%
identical to PCBP2 at the DNA level and 90% homologous at the amino acid
level. The PCBP1 protein is about 85% similar to the mouse hnRNP-X/mCTBP
protein (Hahm et al., 1993).

Chkheidze and Liebhaber (2003) determined that endogenous HeLa cell
PCBP1 colocalized to nuclear speckles with SC35 (600813). They
identified a nuclear localization signal within a 9-amino acid segment
between KH2 and KH3. Deletion of this segment blocked nuclear
accumulation of PCBP1.

GENE FUNCTION

When expressed with a vaccinia virus system in transformed amnion cells,
Leffers et al. (1995) found that both PCBP1 and PCBP2 bound poly(rC)
when not phosphorylated; phosphorylated protein bound with much lower
affinity.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a human brain cDNA library, Kosturko et
al. (2006) found that mouse Hnrnpa2 (600124) interacted with human
HNRNPE1. They confirmed the interaction with in vivo and in vitro
protein interaction assays. Hnrnpe1 colocalized with Hnrnpa2 and A2RE
mRNA in granules in dendrites of rat oligodendrocytes. Overexpression of
HNRNPE1 or microinjection of exogenous HNRNPE1 in rat neural cells
inhibited translation of A2RE mRNA, but not translation of mutated A2RE
mRNA. Excess HNRNPE1 added to an in vitro translation system reduced
translation efficiency of A2RE mRNA in an Hnrnpa2-dependent manner.
Kosturko et al. (2006) hypothesized that binding of HNRNPE1 to HNRNPA2
inhibits A2RE mRNA translation during granule transport.

Shi et al. (2008) identified PCBP1 in a genetic screen to identify human
genes that, when expressed in yeast, could increase the amount of iron
loaded into ferritin (see 134790). PCBP1 bound to ferritin in vivo, and
bound iron and facilitated iron loading into ferritin in vitro.
Depletion of PCBP1 in human cells inhibited ferritin iron loading and
increased cytosolic iron pools. Thus, Shi et al. (2008) concluded that
PCBP1 can function as a cytosolic iron chaperone in the delivery of iron
to ferritin.

MAPPING

Transcripts of both PCBPs were detected in all the human tissues
analyzed. Tommerup and Leffers (1996) mapped PCBP1 to 2p13-p12 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

;;RIBOSOMAL RNA-PROCESSING PROTEIN 42, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; RRP42;;
KIAA0116
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing cDNAs randomly selected from a cDNA library derived from
the human immature myeloid cell line KG-1, Nagase et al. (1995) isolated
a cDNA encoding RRP42, which they designated KIAA0116. The predicted
290-amino acid KIAA0116 protein is 26.7% identical to the 75-kD
autoantigen (PMSCL1; 606180) over a 225-amino acid region. Northern blot
analysis detected expression of KIAA0116 in all tissues tested.

Inherently unstable mammalian mRNAs contain AU-rich elements (AREs)
within their 3-prime untranslated regions. In yeast, 3-prime-to-5-prime
mRNA degradation is mediated by the exosome, a multisubunit particle.
Chen et al. (2001) purified and characterized the human exosome by mass
spectrometry and found its composition to be similar to its yeast
counterpart. They identified the following protein subunits within the
human exosome: p7, which is homologous to the yeast Rrp4 protein
(602238); p8, which is homologous to the yeast Rrp42 protein; p9, which
is homologous to the yeast Rrp43 protein (OIP2; 606019); p10, which is
homologous to the yeast Rrp40 protein (606489); p11, which is homologous
to the yeast Mtr3 protein (606490); p12A, which is homologous to the
yeast Rrp41 protein (606491); p12B, which is homologous to the yeast
Rrp46 protein (606492); and p13, which is homologous to the yeast Csl4
protein (606493). They also identified 2 exosome-associated factors, p1
(600478) and p14 (MPP6; 605500), that were not homologous to any yeast
exosome components.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a cell-free RNA decay system, Chen et al. (2001) demonstrated that
the mammalian exosome is required for rapid degradation of
ARE-containing RNAs but not for poly(A) shortening. They found that the
mammalian exosome does not recognize ARE-containing RNAs on its own. ARE
recognition required certain ARE-binding proteins that could interact
with the exosome and recruit it to unstable RNAs, thereby promoting
their rapid degradation.

Using mammalian 2-hybrid and GST pull-down analyses, Raijmakers et al.
(2002) found that the CSL4 protein, but not mutant forms lacking N- or
C-terminal residues, interacted directly with RRP42 and RRP46. The
deletion mutants were also unable to interact with the exosome. RRP42
and RRP46 did not interact with each other.

MAPPING

By analysis of a panel of human/rodent hybrid cell lines, Nagase et al.
(1995) mapped the KIAA0116 gene to chromosome 3.

DNase I-LIKE, MUSCLE-SPECIFIC
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Parrish et al. (1995) isolated a novel cDNA from the region of Xq28
between QM (312173) and DXS1010E. Translation of the long open reading
frame found in the cDNA yielded a putative 302-amino acid protein with
37.6% identity to human DNase I (125505). The protein was predicted to
contain a signal sequence at the amino terminus, a transmembrane domain
near the carboxyl terminus, and a helix-loop-helix domain. The
transcript was present at highest levels in skeletal and cardiac muscle,
with lower expression in other tissues.

Pergolizzi et al. (1996) screened cDNA libraries with a cosmid that had
been mapped to Xq28 in the region between RCP/GCP (300822; 300821) and
G6PD (305900). They obtained a 2.1-kb cDNA and showed that it encodes a
putative 302-amino acid protein with 44% sequence identity to pig DNase
I and 39% identity to human DNase I. Northern blot analysis detected a
single 2.0-kb transcript in adult heart and skeletal muscle and an
additional transcript of 2.5 kb in some fetal tissues. The sequence of
Pergolizzi et al. (1996) was identical to that reported by Parrish et
al. (1995).

MAPPING

The DNASE1L1 gene maps to chromosome Xq28 (Parrish et al., 1995).

611059	TITLE *611059 WD REPEAT-CONTAINING PROTEIN 82; WDR82
;;TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN 113; TMEM113
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

WDR82 is a regulatory component of the mammalian SET1A (611052) and
SET1B (611055) histone H3 (see 602810) lys4 methyltransferase complexes
(Lee and Skalnik, 2005; Lee et al., 2007). WDR82 additionally associates
with multiple protein complexes, including a chaperonin-containing TCP1
(186980) complex and a protein phosphatase-1 (PP1; see 176875) complex
(Lee et al., 2010).

CLONING

In their Figure 3, Lee et al. (2010) showed that the WDR82 protein
contains 7 WD40 domains distributed throughout the molecule.

GENE FUNCTION

By mass spectrometric analysis of nuclear proteins that
immunoprecipitated with WDR82 from HEK293 cell nuclear extracts, Lee et
al. (2010) identified WDR82 as a component of several protein complexes,
including 4 distinct histone H3 lys4 methyltransferase complexes, a
chaperonin-containing TCP1 complex, and a PP1 complex. They
characterized the PP1 complex further and found that it contained PNUTS
(PPP1R10; 603771), TOX4 (614032), WDR82, and any 1 of the 3 catalytic
subunits of PP1, PP1-alpha (PPP1CA; 176875), PP1-beta (PPP1CB; 600590),
or PP1-gamma (PPP1CC; 176914). The complex, which they called PTW/PP1,
had an apparent molecular mass of about 200 kD, suggesting that it
contains 1 molecule of each subunit. Mutation analysis revealed that
human WDR82 interacted with a central domain of mouse Pnuts. WDR82 did
not interact directly with any other human PTW/PP1 subunit. The PTW/PP1
complex efficiently dephosphorylated the isolated C-terminal domain of
the large subunit of mouse RNA polymerase II (POLR2A; 180660) in vitro.
The PTW/PP1 complex was stable throughout the cell cycle in HEK293
cells, but its association with chromatin was regulated. PTW/PP1
associated with chromatin during interphase, was excluded from condensed
chromosomes during early mitosis, and was reloaded onto chromosomes at
late telophase.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the TMEM113
gene to chromosome 3 (TMAP SHGC-77002). Scott (2007) mapped the TMEM113
gene to chromosome 3p21.1 based on an alignment of the TMEM113 sequence
(GenBank GENBANK AC092045) with the genomic sequence (build 36.2).

601281	TITLE *601281 SEMAPHORIN 3B; SEMA3B
;;SEMAPHORIN A; SEMAA;;
SEMAPHORIN V; SEMA5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The semaphorin/collapsin family of molecules plays a critical role in
the guidance of growth cones during neuronal development. See
semaphorin-3F (601124).

CLONING

In the process of constructing a complete cosmid/P1 contig covering this
region for the positional cloning of oncogenes, Sekido et al. (1996)
identified 2 additional members of the human semaphorin family,
semaphorin-3B, which they called semaphorin A(V), and semaphorin-3F,
which they called semaphorin IV, in chromosome region 3p21.3. The 2
genes have widespread but distinct patterns of expression in nonneural
tissues, and have different patterns of expression in lung cancer. Human
semaphorin A(V) has 86% amino acid homology with murine semaphorin A,
whereas semaphorin IV is more closely related to murine semaphorin E,
with 50% homology. Sekido et al. (1996) showed that human semaphorin
A(V) is translated in vitro into a 90-kD protein that accumulates in the
endoplasmic reticulum. Human semaphorin A(V) was expressed in only 1 out
of 23 small cell lung cancers (SCLCs) and 7 out of 16 non-SCLCs, whereas
semaphorin IV was expressed in 19 out of 23 SCLCs and 13 out of 16
non-SCLCs. Mutational analysis of semaphorin A(V) revealed mutations
(germline in 1 case) in 3 of 40 lung cancers.

Using Northern blot analysis, Lerman and Minna (2000) detected wide
expression of a 3.4-kb SEMA3B transcript that was strongest in placenta,
weaker in other tissues, including lung and testis, and not detectable
in small cell lung cancer cell lines. Missense mutations were found in
nonsmall cell lung cancer cell lines. The authors stated that SEMA3B is
likely to be an extracellular secreted protein. Lerman and Minna (2000)
concluded that SEMA3B is an attractive candidate for methylation and
functional tumor suppressor gene analyses.

GENE FUNCTION

The short arm of chromosome 3 exhibits high loss of heterozygosity (LOH)
in several types of cancer, including ovarian, kidney, lung, and
testicular. In particular, overlapping homozygous deletions in lung
cancers have been identified in region 3p21.3; more than 90% of small
cell lung cancers (182280) exhibit LOH at this site. To examine the
question of whether the SEMA3B gene, which resides on 3p21.3, may be a
tumor suppressor gene, Tse et al. (2002) analyzed the effects of SEMA3B
on HEY cells, an ovarian cancer cell line. They found that HEY cells
expressing SEMA3B diminished tumorigenicity in nude mice. SEMA3B also
markedly reduced the anchorage independence of HEY cells.

Gong et al. (2003) described a large-scale screen to create an atlas of
CNS gene expression at the cellular level, and to provide a library of
verified bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) vectors and transgenic
mouse lines that offer experimental access to CNS regions, cell classes,
and pathways. They demonstrated that Sema3b is involved in axon-target
interactions. Sema3b can act to repulse axons expressing neuropilin-2
(NPN2; 602070) and can antagonize the repulsive action of Sema3a
(603961) on axonal growth cones expressing neuropilin-1 (602069).
Visualization of the expression of the enhanced green fluorescent
protein (EGFP) reporter in Sema3b BAC transgenic mice predicted an
important role for Sema3b in the formation of the circuitry of the
olfactory system. In embryonic day 15.5 embryos, Sema3b expression in
the developing olfactory system was widespread. Intense expression was
also present in the developing vomeronasal organ.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Lerman and Minna (2000) determined that
the SEMA3B gene contains 17 exons and spans 8 to 10 kb.

MAPPING

Sekido et al. (1996) mapped the SEMA3B and SEMA3F genes to chromosome
3p21.3. The 2 genes lie within approximately 70 kb of each other. SEMA3B
and SEMA3F are flanked by 2 GTP-binding protein genes, GNAI2 (139360)
and GNAT1 (139330). Sekido et al. (1996) stated that other human
semaphorin gene sequences, for example, human semaphorin III (SEMA3A;
603961) and homologs of murine semaphorins B (SEMA4A) and C (SEMA4B),
are not located on chromosome 3.

;;SMALL CTD PHOSPHATASE 2; SCP2;;
CONSERVED GENE AMPLIFIED IN OSTEOSARCOMA 4; OS4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing genes within a region of chromosome 12 amplified in
sarcomas and brain tumors, Su et al. (1997) cloned CTDSP2, which they
designated OS4. The deduced 283-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 31.8 kD. Northern blot analysis detected expression in
all tissues examined, with highest expression in pancreas and lowest
expression in brain, lung, and liver.

Yeo et al. (2003) determined that the phosphatase domain of CTDSP2
shares more than 90% homology with the phosphatase domains of CTDSP1
(605323) and CTDSPL (608592).

GENE FUNCTION

Su et al. (1997) found that expression of CTDSP2 mRNA was enhanced in
several cancer cell lines with amplification of the CTDSP2 and CDK4
(123829) genes. CTDSP2 was also coamplified with CDK4 in 5 of 5 primary
sarcomas. Su et al. (1997) hypothesized that CTDSP2 may contribute to
the development of a subset of sarcomas.

Using the synthetic substrate para-nitrophenylphosphate in an in vitro
phosphatase assay, Yeo et al. (2003) determined that CTDSP2 has
phosphatase activity similar to that of SCP1, with Mg(2+)-dependent
activity and a pH optimum near 5.0.

Neuronal gene transcription is repressed in nonneuronal cells by the
repressor element-1 (RE1)-silencing transcription
factor/neuron-restrictive silencer factor (REST/NRSF; 600571) complex.
To understand how this silencing is achieved, Yeo et al. (2005) examined
CTDSP1, CTDSP2, and CTDSPL, the small CTD phosphatases (SCP), whose
expression is restricted to nonneuronal tissues. Yeo et al. (2005)
showed that REST/NRSF recruits SCPs to neuronal genes that contain RE1
elements, leading to neuronal gene silencing in nonneuronal cells.
Phosphatase-inactive forms of SCP interfere with REST/NRSF function and
promote neuronal differentiation of P19 stem cells. Likewise, small
interfering RNA directed to the single Drosophila SCP unmasks neuronal
gene expression in S2 cells. Thus, Yeo et al. (2005) concluded that SCP
activity is an evolutionarily conserved transcriptional regulator that
acts globally to silence neuronal genes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chang et al. (2008) showed that the CTDSP2 gene has 8 exons and that
intron 5 contains the microRNA MIRN26A2.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Su et al. (1997) mapped the CTDSP2 gene to
chromosome 12q13-q15, where it lies about 60 kb telomeric to the CDK4
gene.

604266	TITLE *604266 MULTIPLE EPIDERMAL GROWTH FACTOR-LIKE DOMAINS 6; MEGF6
;;EPIDERMAL GROWTH FACTOR-LIKE 3, FORMERLY; EGFL3, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The domain that characterizes epidermal growth factor (EGF; 131530)
consists of approximately 50 amino acids with 3 disulfide bonds.
EGF-like domains are believed to play a critical role in a number of
extracellular events, including cell adhesion and receptor-ligand
interactions. Proteins with EGF-like domains often consist of more than
1,000 amino acids, have multiple copies of the EGF-like domain, and
contain additional domains known to be involved in specific
protein-protein interactions. To identify proteins containing EGF-like
domains, Nakayama et al. (1998) searched a database of long cDNA
sequences randomly selected from a human brain cDNA library for those
that encode an EGF-like motif. They identified several partial cDNAs
encoding novel proteins with EGF-like domains, such as EGFL3, which they
named MEGF6. Nakayama et al. (1998) isolated a rat cDNA containing the
complete Megf6 coding sequence. The predicted Megf6 protein contains a
signal sequence and 30 EGF-like domains, 3 of which are a
calcium-binding type and 23 of which contain 2 additional cysteine
residues within the consensus EGF-like motif. The N-terminal portion of
Megf6 shows significant sequence similarity to fibrillin (134797).
Northern blot analysis detected Megf6 expression in rat lung.

MAPPING

Using a radiation hybrid mapping panel, Nakayama et al. (1998) mapped
the EGFL3 gene to 1p36.3.

606398	TITLE *606398 ACTIVATING TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 5; ATF5
;;ATFX
DESCRIPTION Activating transcription factors (ATFs), or cAMP response
element-binding proteins (CREBs), bind to cAMP-inducible promoters and
are involved in gene transcription.

CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen with CDC34 (116948) as the bait, Pati et
al. (1999) obtained a partial cDNA encoding ATF5. The deduced 122-amino
acid protein contains a C-terminal bZIP motif with only 3 leucines
instead of the conventional 5; the 2 distal leucines are replaced by
valines. Functional analysis showed that ATF5 is degraded by ubiquitin
proteasome machinery in a CDC34- and RAD6B (UBE2B; 179095)-dependent
pathway.

By yeast 2-hybrid screening with the GABA-B receptor (GABBR1; 603540) as
the bait, White et al. (2000) isolated a full-length cDNA encoding ATF5,
which they termed ATFX. Sequence analysis predicted that the 282-amino
acid protein, which is 57% identical to CREB2 (ATF2; 123811) in the bZIP
domain, contains 2 N-terminal consensus MAP kinase phosphorylation
sites. Mutation analysis showed that the GABBR1-ATF5 interaction occurs
between the C-terminal coiled-coil domain of GABBR1 and the bZIP domain
of ATF5.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen with PRL1 (PTP4A1; 601585) as the bait,
Peters et al. (2001) identified a cDNA encoding ATF5, which they termed
ATF7. EMSA analysis indicated that ATF5 binds to CRE but not C/EBP
oligonucleotides. Northern blot analysis revealed ubiquitous expression
of ATF5, with highest levels in liver, lung, adipose tissue, heart, and
skeletal muscle. Coimmunoprecipitation and GST pull-down analyses
confirmed the association of the C-terminal bZIP motif of ATF5 with the
PTPase domain and adjacent residues of PRL1 in vitro. SDS-PAGE analysis
showed that PRL1 dephosphorylates ATF5.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the ATF5
gene to chromosome 19 (TMAP stSG54779).

GENE FUNCTION

Sheng et al. (2010) used a genomewide RNAi screen in mouse glioma
(137800) cells to identify activators of the trancription factor ATF5,
which is highly expressed in glioma cells. The results indicated that
FRS2 (607743), PAK1 (602590), and CREB3L2 (608834) are components of
RAS-MAPK- or PI3K-activated pathways that regulate ATF5 expression, and
that this pathway is required for viability of malignant glioma cells.
Further studies indicated that ATF5 promoted survival through
upregulation of MCL1 (159552), an antiapoptotic factor. The ATF5 pathway
was also found to promote survival in other human cancer cell lines.
Analysis of human malignant glioma samples indicated that ATF5
expression inversely correlated with disease prognosis. The RAF kinase
inhibitor sorafenib suppressed ATF5 expression in glioma stem cells and
inhibited malignant glioma growth in human cell culture and mouse
models. The findings demonstrated that ATF5 is essential in genesis of
malignant glioma.

;;ANNEXIN VI; ANX6;;
CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEIN p68;;
CALELECTRIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ANXA6 is a member of a family of proteins that bind membrane or
cytoskeleton in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. These proteins are
characterized by homologous amino acid sequences that are present in
multiple copies in each protein. The family is variously known as
calelectrins, annexins, calpactins, endonexins, and lipocortins.

CLONING

Three members of the calelectrin family with apparent molecular masses
of 67 kD, 35 kD, and 32.5 kD had been purified to homogeneity. Sudhof et
al. (1988) reported the cDNA cloning and primary structure of human
67-kD calelectrin. The deduced sequence contains 8 similar repeats, each
consisting of about 68 amino acids. Comparison of the 67-kD calelectrin
sequence with the protein sequences of lipocortins I and II (151690,
151740) demonstrated a close relationship (42 to 45% identity).

Thomas et al. (2002) found that Anxa6 showed a punctate supranuclear and
apical distribution in rat pancreatic acinary cells. Anxa6 colocalized
with Crhsp28, a component of a protein complex associated with vesicular
structures.

MAPPING

Davies et al. (1989) assigned the ANXA6 gene to 5q32-q34 by use of a
cDNA clone to probe genomic DNA from rodent-human somatic cell hybrids
and for in situ hybridization. The corresponding gene in the mouse was
assigned to chromosome 11 by probing DNA from rodent-rodent somatic cell
hybrids. Warrington and Bengtsson (1994) used 3 physical mapping methods
(radiation hybrid mapping, pulsed field gel electrophoresis, and
fluorescence in situ hybridization of interphase nuclei) to determine
the order and relative distances between 12 loci in the 5q31-q33 region.
ANXA6 was one of those loci.

GENE STRUCTURE

Smith et al. (1994) demonstrated that the ANX6 gene is approximately 60
kb long and contains 26 exons. The genomic sequence at the 3-prime end
does not contain a canonical polyadenylylation signal. The genomic
sequence upstream of the transcription start site contains TATAA and
CAAT motifs. The spatial organization of the exons revealed no obvious
similarities between the 2 halves of the ANX6 gene. Comparison of the
intron/exon boundary positions of ANX6 with those of ANX1 (151690) and
ANX2 (151740) revealed that within the repeated domains the breakpoints
are perfectly conserved except for exon 8, which is 1 codon smaller in
ANX2. The corresponding point in the second half of ANX6 is represented
by 2 exons, exons 20 and 21. The latter exon is alternatively spliced,
giving rise to annexin VI isoforms that differ with respect to a 6-amino
acid insertion at the start of repeat 7.

GENE FUNCTION

Thomas et al. (2002) found that stimulation of rat pancreatic acinary
cells with the secretagogue cholecystokinin (118440) enhanced the
colocalization of Anxa6 and Crhsp28 within regions of acini immediately
below the apical plasma membrane. Thomas et al. (2002) concluded that
Ca(2+)-dependent binding between CRHSP28 and ANXA6 is required for
acinar cell membrane trafficking events and digestive enzyme secretion.

DESCRIPTION All human bloods, with exceedingly rare exceptions, carry the red cell H
antigen. It is present in greatest amount on type O red cells and least
on type A1B cells. The H antigen is an intermediate stage in a series of
syntheses ending, in the presence of the A or B genes, in the production
of the corresponding A and B antigens. The first examples of blood
completely lacking H were found in Bombay by Bhende et al. (1952). These
individuals with the so-called Bombay phenotype are recognized by the
presence of anti-H in the serum, in addition to anti-A and anti-B, as in
type O persons. By family studies Levine et al. (1955) and Aloysia et
al. (1961) showed that the Bombay phenotype, called by them Oh, is due
to the presence in homozygous state of a rare recessive gene. Yunis et
al. (1969) found 7 affected persons in 3 generations, including a
homozygous by heterozygous mating. They proposed that there are 2 kinds
of Bombay genotypes. Oriol et al. (1981) suggested that the Se locus and
the Hh locus may be closely linked. This is a condition of their model.
Classically, the Se gene is considered to be a regulatory gene
controlling expression of the structural gene H in external secretions.
Under this hypothesis, Bombay (h-h) persons should not be able to
express the Se gene. Oriol et al. (1981) analyzed statistically the 44
published Bombay pedigrees and concluded that in fact there is no
suppression of Se in Bombay persons. Furthermore, they found a lod score
of 12.9 at 1% recombination for linkage of Se and H. They suggested that
Hh and Se are both structural genes, each coding for a
2-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase. The same group (Le Pendu et al., 1982)
presented evidence that the fucosyltransferase of epithelial origin,
coded by the Se gene, is able to transform both type 1 and type 2
natural substrate, whereas the enzyme of mesodermal origin, coded by the
H gene (mutant in the Bombay phenotype), works preferentially on type 2
natural substrate. The close linkage of the 2 genes is of interest. The
possible existence of 2 alpha (1-to-2) fucosyltransferases was first
suggested on the basis of stereochemical differences between the 2
precursor chains, types 1 and 2.

Gerard et al. (1982) expected a high incidence of H-deficient phenotypes
among the half-million people living on Reunion Island (in the Indian
Ocean east of Madagascar), since most of the cases of the Bombay
phenotype published by French teams of Salmon and others traced their
ancestry to this small island. An analysis of the results of ABO typing
at transfusion centers on the island confirmed their prediction; 42
persons were found to be lacking H-antigen on red cells with anti-H in
their serum. A, B, and AB Bombay subjects had small but detectable
amounts of A and/or B antigens on erythrocytes. All H-deficient persons
were nonsecretors, and one-third were Lewis negative. Of 108 unaffected
persons in 14 Bombay pedigrees, 53 (49%) were se/se, suggesting that the
Bombay probands have an se/se genotype. All the children from Bombay
nonsecretor X unaffected nonsecretor were se/se, supporting the previous
conclusion that Se and H are closely linked structural genes. The 2
largest series of H-deficient phenotypes in the Indian Ocean area
(Bombay and Natal) were Indians. On Reunion, 85% were whites. In a
cooperative study of 85 informative families, Oriol (1983) found a total
lod score of 20.4 at 1% recombination for the H and Se linkage. Close
linkage of H and Le was excluded. Adding previously published lod
scores, Se-Le linkage up to 30% recombination was excluded.

On the basis of the Oriol model, 2 main types of recessive H-deficient
red cell phenotypes are recognized: (1) the nonsecretor classic Bombay
type (h/h, se/se) with H-deficiency of both red cells and saliva, and
(2) the secretor Bombay type (h/h, Se/-) with normal ABH in secretions
but H-deficiency in red cells. Le Pendu et al. (1983) identified 2
variants of the first form on Reunion Island: (1) H-negative persons
with the classic Bombay phenotype, all Indians, who completely lacked H
antigen on their red cells and whose anti-H antibodies reacted strongly
with normal O and O(h) red cells from whites, and (2) H-weak persons,
all white, who showed weak expression of the H antigen and whose anti-H
antibodies reacted with normal O red cells but not with O(h) red cells
regardless of ethnic origin. The authors called the particular variant
of weak H phenotype, belonging to the so-called para-Bombay series,
Reunion. The same phenotype has been found in whites in Europe. On
Reunion, almost all the cases could be traced to the Cilaos area. Indian
Bombay secretor families have been observed, as well as H-deficient
secretor phenotypes in Europeans and Japanese, but no Reunion secretor
phenotype has been found on Reunion Island. Le Pendu et al. (1983) found
a dosage effect for quantitative measurement of H-enzyme activity
(alpha-2-L-fucosyltransferase) in serum. Heterozygotes had about half as
much enzyme activity as homozygotes. Le Pendu et al. (1985) concluded
that there are at least 2 distinct alpha-2-L-fucosyltransferases in
human serum; the enzymatic activity in H-deficient secretor serum may be
the product of the Se gene (182100) and the enzymatic activity found in
the H-normal nonsecretor serum could be the product of the H gene. These
conclusions are consistent with the close linkage of the H and Se genes,
which may have arisen by gene duplication from a common ancestral gene.

Larsen et al. (1990) cloned and sequenced a gene which they showed
encodes the H blood group antigen. When expressed in COS-1 cells, the
cDNA directed expression of cell surface H structures and a cognate
alpha-(1,2)FT activity with properties analogous to the human H blood
group alpha-(1,2)FT. The cDNA predicted a 365-amino acid polypeptide.
Southern blot analysis showed that this cDNA identifies DNA sequences
syntenic to the human H locus on chromosome 19. A study of null alleles
isolated from individuals with the Bombay phenotype will be of interest.
Studies along that line were reported by Kelly et al. (1994).
Inactivating point mutations were identified within the coding portions
of the FUT1 gene in a Bombay pedigree. They were also found in a
para-Bombay pedigree. (According to a 2-locus model, the H blood group
locus determines expression of the H antigen (as well as A and/or B
antigens) in the erythroid lineage, whereas the SE locus controls H
expression (and thus A or B antigen expression) in a variety of
secretory epithelia and in saliva.) Nonsecretors are homozygous for null
alleles at the SE locus, whereas individuals with the Bombay phenotype
lack H determinants in all tissues and appear to be homozygous for null
alleles at both the H and the SE loci. Individuals of the para-Bombay
phenotype synthesize H determinants in their secretory epithelia but not
in the erythroid lineage. These persons are believed to be homozygous
for null alleles at the H locus, but apparently have at least one
functional SE allele. The H and secretor loci are alternatively known as
FUT1 and FUT2, respectively. Since the para-Bombay individuals studied
by Kelly et al. (1994) maintained a functional SE-determined
fucosyltransferase, but not an H-encoded fucosyltransferase, it could be
concluded that the SE locus must correspond to a fucosyltransferase gene
distinct from the one defective in the Bombay phenotype. Thus,
additional support was provided for the conclusion that the human H and
SE blood group loci correspond to distinct fucosyltransferase genes.

From comparison of the genetic and physical maps and linkage studies
using microsatellite markers, Reguigne-Arnould et al. (1995) concluded
that the tightly linked FUT1-FUT2 genes are located on 19q13.3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using gene targeting in embryonic stem cells, Domino et al. (2001)
generated mice that were deficient in Fut1. Fut1-null mice developed
normally and exhibited no gross phenotypic abnormalities. Using
immunohistochemistry, the authors observed that Fut1-null mice were
deficient in epididymal cell surface alpha(1,2)-fucosylated glycans
expressed by wildtype mice. However, normal fertility was observed. They
concluded that alpha(1,2)-fucosylated glycans play nonessential roles in
blastocyst implantation or sperm function in mice.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
BOMBAY PHENOTYPE
FUT1, TYR316TER

Kelly et al. (1994) sequenced approximately 6.5 kb of genomic DNA
encompassing a wildtype allele and the corresponding region in a Bombay
allele. The Bombay allele differed from the wildtype allele at 6
positions. Three of these single nucleotide differences were in the
gene's single intervening sequence, 1 was within the coding region, and
2 were in the 3-prime untranslated region. The sequence difference in
the coding region was a nonsense mutation that created a termination
codon corresponding to amino acid 316 of the wildtype alpha(1,2)FT:
tyr316-to-ter. This sequence alteration predicted a mutant polypeptide
that is missing the 50 C-terminal amino acids of the wildtype enzyme. To
confirm that the tyr316-to-ter mutation inactivates the allele, Kelly et
al. (1994) moved this DNA sequence difference and each of the others
into the wildtype sequence background and tested for function by
transfection into an alpha(1,2)FT-deficient mammalian host, namely,
COS-1 cells. The wildtype construct encoded a substantial amount of
transferase activity, whereas the Bombay construct generated no enzyme
activity. By contrast, vectors containing each of the other DNA sequence
differences expressed normal levels of transferase activity in
transfected cells.

PARA-BOMBAY PHENOTYPE
FUT1, LEU164HIS

In an individual with the para-Bombay phenotype, Kelly et al. (1994)
found compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations of the FUT1 gene:
leu164-to-his and gln276-to-ter.

In 3 unrelated individuals with the Bombay phenotype, Koda et al. (1997)
found that a 725T-G transversion in FUT1, which results in an amino acid
change, leu242 to arg, and complete deletion of FUT2 (182100.0003) were
responsible for the classical Bombay phenotype.

603046	TITLE *603046 RING FINGER PROTEIN 139; RNF139
;;TRANSLOCATION IN RENAL CARCINOMA ON CHROMOSOME 8; TRC8
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

RNF139 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that functions at the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) and is involved in regulating sterol biosynthesis
(Irisawa et al., 2009; Stagg et al., 2009).

CLONING

Using 5-prime RACE, Gemmill et al. (1998) identified TRC8 as the gene on
chromosome 8 disrupted in a lymphoblastoid cell line carrying a
translocation t(3;8)(p14.2;q24.1) established from a family with renal
cell carcinoma (144700) and thyroid carcinoma described by Cohen et al.
(1979). The deduced 664-amino acid human TRC8 protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 76 kD. It has 10 membrane-spanning segments, with 2
regions of similarity with Patched (see PTCH1; 601309), including a
putative sterol-sensing domain and an extracellular loop that, in
Patched, is involved in SHH (600725) binding. TRC8 also has an
intracellular loop that is not conserved among Patched homologs, an
intracellular C-terminal RING-H2 motif, and 3 N-glycosylation sites.
Northern blot analysis detected a 3.0-kb TRC8 mRNA at variable levels in
all tissues examined. RNA dot blot analysis confirmed expression in all
adult and fetal tissues, with highest TRC8 expression in adult testis
and placenta.

GENE FUNCTION

Gemmill et al. (2002) isolated the Drosophila homolog of TRC8 and
studied its function by genetic manipulations and a yeast 2-hybrid
screen. Human and Drosophila TRC8 proteins localized to the ER. Loss of
either Drosophila Trc8 or Vhl resulted in an identical ventral midline
defect. Direct interaction between Trc8 and Vhl in Drosophila was
confirmed by GST pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation experiments.
Gemmill et al. (2002) found that in Drosophila, overexpression of Trc8
inhibited growth consistent with its presumed role as a tumor suppressor
gene. Human JAB1 (604850) localization was dependent on VHL mutant
status. Thus, the VHL, TRC8, and JAB1 proteins appear to be linked both
physically and functionally, and all 3 may participate in the
development of kidney cancer.

Irisawa et al. (2009) noted that overexpression of TRC8 had been shown
to suppress genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis
(Brauweiler et al., 2007). Using human cell lines, Irisawa et al. (2009)
confirmed that TRC8 is a direct sterol-sensing ER membrane protein. TRC8
was destabilized by lipoprotein, but not by cholesterol or
25-hydroxycholesterol, and TRC8 destabilization required TRC8
autoubiquitination via its intrinsic E3 ubiquitin ligase activity.
Conversely, TRC8 was stabilized under lipoprotein-depleted conditions.
Stabilized TRC8 interfered with proteolytic processing of the
cholesterol regulatory protein SRBP2 (SREBF2; 600481) into its
transcriptionally active form. This inhibition required direct binding
of TRC8 to SRBP2 and its interacting partner SCAP (601510), which
blocked transport of SRBP2-SCAP to the Golgi, where proteolytic
activation of SRBP2 occurs. The E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of TRC8 was
dispensable for inhibition of SRBP2 processing. Irisawa et al. (2009)
hypothesized that the inhibitory effect of TRC8 on cholesterol
metabolism could underlie its tumor suppressor function, since cancer
cells require a large amount of membrane cholesterol for rapid cell
growth.

The human cytomegalovirus proteins US2 and US11 hijack the ER-associated
degradation (ERAD) pathway to promote ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal
elimination of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I)
molecules (see 142800). Intracellular degradation of MHC I reduces MHC I
cell surface expression and enhances viral evasion of the immune
response. Stagg et al. (2009) found that small interfering RNA-mediated
knockdown of TRC8 in US2-expressing HeLa cells reduced MHC I
ubiquitination and rescued MHC I cell surface expression. Overexpression
of an inactive RING finger domain mutant of TRC8 also rescued MHC I cell
surface expression. Immunoprecipitation analysis of US2-expressing
HEK293 cells showed that TRC8 was associated with SPP (HM13; 607106), in
addition to US2 and MHC I, in an ER protein complex. Stagg et al. (2009)
concluded that TRC8 is an ERAD ubiquitin E3 ligase that is recruited by
US2 for the ubiquitination and degradation of MHC I during
cytomegalovirus infection.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gemmill et al. (2002) found that the RNF139 upstream region contains a
CpG island.

MAPPING

Gemmill et al. (1998) mapped the TRC8 gene to chromosome 8q24.1 by
analysis of the breakpoint region in a translocation
t(3;8)(p14.2;q24.1).

CYTOGENETICS

Gemmill et al. (1998) found that the TRC8 gene was disrupted in a family
with a constitutional translocation t(3;8)(p14.2;q24.1) and renal cell
carcinoma and thyroid carcinoma described by Cohen et al. (1979). The
3p14.2 breakpoint had been shown to interrupt the fragile histidine
triad (FHIT; 601153) gene in its 5-prime noncoding region (Ohta et al.,
1996). In the 3;8 translocation, TRC8 was fused to FHIT and disrupted
within the sterol-sensing domain. In contrast, the FHIT coding region
was maintained and expressed.

Melendez et al. (2003) described a family in which a t(3;8)(p13;q24.1)
translocation was present in 2 consecutive generations and in which 2
members of the family, the proband and his mother, had clear cell renal
carcinoma. The translocation carrier status of the mother, who was
deceased, could be deduced given that there were other relatives with
the translocation in the family. In the proband, Melendez et al. (2003)
observed loss of the derivative chromosome, der(8), carrying the 3p
segment, and somatic mutation of the VHL gene (608537) in tumor tissue
from the left kidney; the tumor in the right kidney carried a different
VHL mutation and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was not detected. Tumor
tissue in the mother did not carry any VHL gene mutations.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using SSCP analysis with 12 primer pairs covering the coding sequence
and the 5-prime untranslated region of the TRC8 gene in 32 renal
carcinomas, Gemmill et al. (1998) found a duplication of 12 nucleotides
in the 5-prime untranslated region in 1 tumor that was absent in matched
normal DNA. This mutation was verified by multiple separate PCR
amplifications, SSCP analyses and sequencing, as well as proper use of
an alternative primer set, thus eliminating the possibility of a PCR
artifact. The duplication was found to occur in a consistently predicted
RNA stem loop structure. Although studies demonstrated that the 3p14.2
breakpoint interrupted the FHIT gene in its 5-prime noncoding region,
several reasons made it unlikely that FHIT is causally related to renal
or other malignancies. Gemmill et al. (1998) concluded that by analogy
to Patched, TRC8 might function as a signaling receptor, and that other
pathway members are mutation candidates in malignant diseases involving
the kidney and thyroid.

608524	TITLE *608524 INHIBITOR OF GROWTH 4; ING4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for sequences similar to ING1 (601566) and ING2 (604215),
followed by PCR and RACE of a placenta cDNA library, Shiseki et al.
(2003) cloned ING4, which they called p29ING4. The deduced 249-amino
acid protein contains a C-terminal plant homeodomain finger motif and 2
nuclear localization signals.

GENE FUNCTION

Shiseki et al. (2003) showed that overexpression of ING4 or ING5
(608525) in cancer cell lines diminished colony-forming efficiency,
decreased cell population in S phase, and induced p53 (191170)-dependent
apoptosis. Both ING4 and ING5 activated the WAF1 (116899) promoter and
induced WAF1 expression. ING4 and ING5 physically interacted with p300
(602700), a member of histone acetyltransferase complexes, and with p53
in vivo, and they enhanced acetylation of p53 at lys382.

Garkavtsev et al. (2004) reported that ING4 is involved in regulating
brain tumor growth and angiogenesis. Expression of ING4 was
significantly reduced in gliomas as compared with normal human brain
tissue, and the extent of reduction correlated with the progression from
lower to higher grades of tumors. In mice, xenografts of human
glioblastoma U87MG, which has decreased expression of ING4, grew
significantly faster and had higher vascular volume fractions than
control tumors. Garkavtsev et al. (2004) showed that ING4 physically
interacts with the p65 (RelA; 164014) subunit of NFKB (see 164011), and
that ING4 regulates brain tumor angiogenesis through transcriptional
repression of NFKB-responsive genes, including IL8 (146930), IL6
(147620), COX2 (600262), and colony-stimulating factor 3 (138970). The
authors concluded that ING4 has an important role in brain tumor
pathogenesis.

A key component of the hypoxic response pathway is hypoxia-inducible
factor (HIF; see 603348). Ozer et al. (2005) found that ING4 suppressed
expression of HIF target genes under hypoxic conditions. ING4 directly
interacted with HPH2 (EGLN1; 606425), a mediator of HIF stability,
providing a mechanism for ING4 recruitment to HIF. ING4 association with
HPH2 did not affect hydroxylase activity or HIF stability , but it
suppressed HIF activity in a chromatin-dependent manner. Ozer et al.
(2005) hypothesized that ING4, recruited to HIF by HPH2 under hypoxic
conditions, acts as an adaptor protein to recruit transcriptional
repressors to mediate HIF activity.

By immunopurifying HeLa cell proteins that associated with ING4, Doyon
et al. (2006) found that ING4 was a component of a histone
acetyltransferase complex containing HBO1 (MYST2; 609880). Using an in
vitro acetyltransferase assay, they showed that the complex could
acetylate lysines of the histone H4 (see 602822) N-terminal domain.

Zhang et al. (2010) presented evidence that microRNA-650 (MIR650;
615379) plays a role in human gastric cancer tumorigenicity. Using
bioinformatic analysis, they identified a potential binding site for
MIR650 in the 3-prime UTR of ING4. Transfection of MIR650 precursor into
HEK293 cells reduced protein content of ING4, whereas inhibition of
MIR650 increased expression of a reporter gene containing the ING4
3-prime UTR.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the ING4
gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP WI-19753).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Kim et al. (2004) devised a screen for genes that suppress the loss of
contact inhibition elicited by overexpression of the protooncogene MYCN
(164840). The initial application of this screen detected 9 distinctive
suppressors within a representative human cDNA library. One of these
genes was ING4, a potential tumor suppressor gene. Ectopic expression of
ING4 suppressed the loss of contact inhibition elicited by either MYCN
or MYC (190080) but had no direct effect on cellular proliferation.
Pursuing the possibility that ING4 might be a tumor suppressor gene, Kim
et al. (2004) found inactivating mutations in ING4 transcripts from
various human cancer cell lines. In addition, they used comparative
genomic hybridization to detect deletion of the ING4 locus in 10 to 20%
of human breast cancer cell lines and primary breast tumors. Ectopic
expression of ING4 attenuated the growth of the human breast tumor cell
line T47D in soft agar. Kim et al. (2004) concluded that ING4 is a
strong candidate as a tumor suppressor gene.

HIGH DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL LEVEL QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCUS
8, INCLUDED; HDLCQ8, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Hematopoietic precursor cells migrate to the thymus, where they
differentiate into mature T lymphocytes. Aurrand-Lions et al. (1996)
reported the cDNA cloning and functional analysis of mouse vanin-1
(vascular noninflammatory molecule-1), a novel cell surface molecule
that is involved in the thymus homing of bone marrow cells. Vanin-1 is a
glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored molecule expressed by
perivascular thymic stromal cells. Antibody against vanin-1 blocked
thymus colonization by hematopoietic progenitor cells in both short- and
long-term assays and interfered with lymphostromal cell adhesion. The
authors suggested that vanin-1 regulates late adhesion steps of thymus
homing under physiologic, noninflammatory conditions.

By searching an EST database with mouse vanin-1 and human vanin-2 (VNN2;
603571) cDNA sequences, Galland et al. (1998) identified cDNAs encoding
human vanin-1 (VNN1). The deduced 513-amino acid VNN1 protein shares
78%, 64%, and 43% sequence identity with mouse vanin-1, VNN2, and
biotinidase (609019), respectively. Like mouse vanin-1, human VNN1 has a
leader peptide and a C-terminal GPI cleavage motif. VNN1 protein
translated in vitro migrated as 55- and 53-kD polypeptides. Northern
blot analysis revealed that the 3.4-kb VNN1 mRNA is expressed in spleen,
thymus, peripheral blood lymphocytes, and small intestine; minor
transcripts were also detected.

Martin et al. (2001) found that the vanin family is encoded by at least
2 mouse genes, vanin-1 and vanin-3, and 3 human orthologous genes, VNN1,
VNN2, and VNN3 (606592). They showed that the vanin genes encode
different isoforms of the mammalian pantetheinase activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Martin et al. (2001) reported the structural characterization of the
human and mouse vanin genes. All contain 7 exons.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, Galland et al. (1998) mapped the mouse vanin-1
gene to the proximal third of chromosome 10, which shows homology of
synteny with human 6q21-q24. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization
and analysis of somatic cell hybrids, they localized the human VNN1 gene
to 6q23-q24. Galland et al. (1998) identified a YAC clone from 6q23-q24
that contained both the VNN1 and VNN2 genes.

Martin et al. (2001) found that the 3 human vanin genes are closely
linked on 6q23-q24 and are aligned in the same transcriptional
orientation. The 2 mouse vanin genes are located on chromosome 10A2B1.

GENE FUNCTION

The mouse vanin-1 molecule plays a role in thymic reconstitution
following damage by irradiation. Pitari et al. (2000) demonstrated that
the mouse vanin-1 molecule is a pantetheinase, i.e., an amidohydrolase
that catalyzes the hydrolysis of D-pantetheine, permitting the recycling
of pantothenate (vitamin B5) and the generation of an antioxidant
metabolite, cysteamine.

The mammalian sex-determining pathway is controlled by the presence or
absence of SRY (480000) expression in the embryonic gonad. To identify
additional sex-determining or gonadal differentiation genes, Grimmond et
al. (2000) screened for genes exhibiting sexually dimorphic patterns of
expression in the mouse gonad at 12.5 and 13.5 days postcoitum, after
overt gonad differentiation, by comparing complex cDNA probes derived
from male and female gonadal tissue at these stages on microarrays
constructed from a normalized urogenital ridge library. Using in situ
hybridization analysis, they determined that mouse protease nexin-1
(177010) and Vnn1 exhibit male-specific expression prior to overt
gonadal differentiation and are detected in the somatic portion of the
developing gonad, suggesting to the authors a possible direct link to
the testis-determining pathway for both genes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Quantitative differences in gene expression are thought to contribute to
phenotypic differences between individuals. Goring et al. (2007)
generated genomewide transcriptional profiles of lymphocyte samples from
1,240 participants in the San Antonio Family Heart Study. Evidence of
significant heritability was found for the expression levels of 85% of
the 19,648 detected autosomal transcripts. By linkage analysis, the
authors uncovered more than 1,000 cis-regulated transcripts and showed
that the expression quantitative trait loci with the most significant
linkage evidence are often located at the structural locus of a given
transcript. To highlight the usefulness of this much-enlarged map of
cis-regulated transcripts for the discovery of genes that influence
complex traits in humans, Goring et al. (2007) selected high density
lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) concentration as a phenotype of clinical
importance, and identified the cis-regulated VNN1 gene as harboring
sequence variants that influence HDLC concentrations. Several VNN1
promoter variants showed highly significant association with HDLC
concentration. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that one of these, the
-137T allele (603570.0001), is embedded in a consensus Sp1 binding site.
This and other information provided indirect support for functionality
of this promoter variant.

ANIMAL MODEL

Martin et al. (2004) generated Vnn1-deficient mice that lacked free
cysteamine and examined their susceptibility to intestinal inflammation,
either acute (NSAID administration) or chronic (Schistosoma mansoni
infection). They found that Vnn1 -/- mice better controlled inflammatory
reaction and intestinal injury in both experiments, and had increased
gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (see 606857) activity and increased
stores of reduced glutathione, as well as reduced inflammatory cell
activation in inflamed tissues. Oral administration of cystamine
reversed all aspects of the deficient phenotype. Martin et al. (2004)
concluded that the pantetheinase activity of the vanin-1 molecule is a
major regulator of intestinal inflammation, acting through cysteamine
release.

120325	TITLE *120325 COLLAGEN, TYPE XV, ALPHA-1; COL15A1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Myers et al. (1992) isolated a 2.1-kb cDNA clone containing a derived
gly-X-Y sequence very different from those of collagen types I through
XIV. The protein partially encoded by this clone was named the alpha-1
chain of type XV collagen. Kivirikko et al. (1994) and Muragaki et al.
(1994) obtained additional cDNA sequences and deduced the complete
primary structure of the polypeptide. The former group also partially
characterized the gene structure, while the latter noted strong amino
acid sequence similarity to mouse alpha-1(XVIII) collagen (COL18A1;
120328). The presence of a predicted signal peptide suggests that the
protein is secreted into the extracellular matrix. Muragaki et al.
(1994) also presented evidence for predominant expression in embryonic
internal organs such as the adrenal glands, kidney, and pancreas. Types
XV and XVIII collagen form a distinct subgroup among the collagens
(Muragaki et al., 1994; Rehn et al., 1994). Type XVIII collagen
(COL18A1; 120328) is the precursor of endostatin, which has a potent
antiangiogenic effect. The highest degree of homology between collagens
type XV and type XVIII involves the C-terminal endostatin sequence. The
corresponding fragment in type XV collagen has also been shown to have
antiangiogenic activity (Ramchandran et al., 1999; Sasaki et al., 2000).

Myers et al. (1996) stated that the collagen family of proteins consists
of 19 types encoded by 33 genes. Type XV collagen has a 577-amino acid,
highly interrupted, triple-helical region that is flanked by N- and
C-terminal noncollagenous domains of 555 and 256 residues, respectively.

Hagg et al. (1998) reported that the COL15A1 protein contains 1,388
amino acids.

GENE FUNCTION

Myers et al. (1996) produced a bacteria-expressed recombinant protein
representing the first half of the type XV collagen C-terminal domain in
order to generate highly specific polyclonal antisera. Northern blot
hybridization to human tissue RNAs indicated that type XV has a
widespread distribution. To determine the precise localization of type
XV collagen, immunohistochemical analyses were performed. A surprisingly
restricted and uniform presence was demonstrated in many tissues which
showed a strong association with vascular, neuronal, mesenchymal, and
some epithelial basement membrane zones. Myers et al. (1996) suggested
that type XV collagen may function in some manner to adhere basement
membrane to the underlying connective tissue stroma.

Using an antibody produced against the C-terminal noncollagenous domain
of human type XV collagen, Hagg et al. (1997) found conspicuous staining
of most capillaries and the staining of the basement membrane zones of
muscle cells. Differences in the expression of type XV collagen could be
observed during kidney development, and staining of fetal lung tissue
suggested that changes in its expression may also occur during the
formation of vascular structures. Pronounced renal interstitial type XV
collagen staining was observed in patients with kidney fibrosis
occurring as part of different pathologic processes. They suggested that
the accumulation of type XV collagen may accompany fibrotic processes.

To understand the biologic role of type XV collagen, Eklund et al.
(2001) introduced a null mutation in the Col15a1 gene into the germline
of mice. Despite the complete lack of type XV collagen, the mutant mice
developed and reproduced normally, and they were indistinguishable from
their wildtype littermates. However, Col15a1-deficient mice showed
progressive histologic changes characteristic for muscular disease after
3 months of age, and they were more vulnerable than controls to
exercise-induced muscle injury. Despite the antiangiogenic role of type
XV collagen-derived endostatin, the development of the vasculature
appeared normal in the null mice. Nevertheless, ultrastructural analyses
revealed collapsed capillaries and endothelial cell degeneration in
heart and skeletal muscle. Furthermore, perfused hearts showed a
diminished inotropic response, and exercise resulted in cardiac injury,
changes that mimic early or mild heart disease. Thus, type XV collagen
appears to function as a structural component needed to stabilize
skeletal muscle cells and microvessels.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Hagg et al. (1998) determined that the
COL15A1 gene has 42 coding exons spanning 145 kb. The promoter region
lacks a TATAA motif, has multiple apparently functional Sp1
(189906)-binding sites, and has several GC motifs similar to the
promoters of housekeeping genes. Comparative analysis between COL15A1
and mouse Col18a1 (120328) suggested that the 2 genes are derived from a
common ancestor.

MAPPING

By studying DNAs from rodent-human hybrid cells and by in situ
hybridization, Huebner et al. (1992) assigned the gene to 9q21-q22, a
region to which no other collagen genes had previously been assigned.
Huebner et al. (1992) stated that this was the twenty-first collagen
gene to be localized and that chromosome 9 was the twelfth of the human
chromosomes found to contain at least one member of this unusual gene
family. Hagg et al. (1997) cloned the mouse gene and mapped it to mouse
chromosome 4 in a region of conserved synteny with human chromosome
9q21-q22.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using light and electron microscopy, Rasi et al. (2010) found that
deletion of Col15a1 in mice resulted in disorganized fibrillar collagen
bundles in heart, with interstitial deposition of nonfibrillar protein
aggregates, abnormal capillary morphology, extravasated erythrocytes,
and ischemic damage in some cardiomyocytes. These changes correlated
with measurable microvascular and cardiac dysfunction and increased
myocardial stiffness. Echocardiograms indicated that the early changes
in cardiac performance and geometry in Col15a1 -/- mice varied with age
and showed some reversal with age.

612607	TITLE *612607 LATE CORNIFIED ENVELOPE PROTEIN 1E; LCE1E
;;LATE ENVELOPE PROTEIN 5; LEP5
DESCRIPTION For background information on the LCE gene cluster, see 612603.

CLONING

By database analysis to identify human orthologs of mouse genes encoding
late envelope proteins (LEPs), Marshall et al. (2001) identified LCE1E,
which they called LEP5.

Using real-time PCR with primers that did not differentiate between
LCE1D (612606) and LCE1E, Jackson et al. (2005) detected moderate
LCE1D/E expression in human fetal, arm, penal, and abdominal skin. Much
lower expression was detected in vulva, and little to no expression was
detected in tongue and esophagus. Using 5-prime RACE and sequence
analysis, Jackson et al. (2005) identified a minor LCE1E splice variant
containing 2 untranslated upstream exons.

GENE FUNCTION

Jackson et al. (2005) showed that expression of LCE1 genes, including
LCE1D/E, was upregulated in cultured normal human keratinocytes by
ultraviolet irradiation, but not by calcium. Real-time PCR of skin
biopsies from 4 normal individuals revealed an individual who lacked
LCE1D/E almost completely. The individual did not have a major skin
defect, suggesting the loss of 1 of these genes has only minor
consequences.

GENE STRUCTURE

Jackson et al. (2005) determined that the LCE1E gene contains 3 exons.
Exon 1 is noncoding, and the second exon is an alternatively spliced,
noncoding minor exon.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Marshall et al. (2001) mapped the LCE1E
gene within the LCE gene cluster on chromosome 1q21. Jackson et al.
(2005) stated that the mouse Lce1e gene maps to a syntenic LCE gene
cluster on chromosome 3F1.

602617	TITLE *602617 FORKHEAD BOX E1; FOXE1
;;FORKHEAD, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG-LIKE 15; FKHL15;;
THYROID TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 2; TTF2;;
TITF2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The 'forkhead' gene family, originally identified in Drosophila, encodes
transcription factors with a conserved 100-amino acid DNA-binding motif
called the 'forkhead domain'. Chadwick et al. (1997) isolated FKHL15
cDNAs from a cDNA library enriched for transcripts from 9q22. The
predicted 376-amino acid FKHL15 protein contains a 19-residue
polyalanine tract and 2 putative nuclear localization signals which
flank the forkhead domain. Northern blot analysis detected a single
4.5-kb FKHL15 mRNA in a variety of tissues and multiple FKHL15
transcripts in others.

Clifton-Bligh et al. (1998) found by a database search against the rat
TTF2 gene more than 90% homology with FKHL15. A probe specific to the
3-prime UTR of FKHL15 detected a 5.3-kb transcript that was highly
expressed in thyroid tissues, and a second 3.2-kb transcript seen in
both thyroid and testis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Clifton-Bligh et al. (1998) found that the FKHL15 gene consists of a
single exon.

MAPPING

Chadwick et al. (1997) localized the FKHL15 gene to 9q22 by somatic cell
hybrid analysis and by its inclusion in cosmids that map to that region.

GENE FUNCTION

Thyroid gland organogenesis involves the dorso-caudal migration of a
median endodermal bud that originates from the posterior region of the
pharyngeal floor. The thyroid primordium migrates to the area located
between the fourth pharyngeal pouches and eventually fuses with them.
The adult thyroid gland is composed of cells derived from all 3 germ
layers, but thyroid follicular cells (TFCs), which are responsible for
thyroid hormone biosynthesis, appear to derive primarily from the median
primordium, though a contribution from the endoderm of the pharyngeal
pouches has also been proposed (Manley and Capecchi, 1998). Functional
differentiation, as shown by the expression of thyroglobulin, occurs in
TFCs following migration, suggesting that migration and functional
differentiation may be mutually exclusive. Three transcription factors,
TTF1 (NKX2-1; 600635), TTF2, and PAX8 (167415), are present from the
start of thyroid morphogenesis. TTF2, which is also expressed in most of
the foregut endoderm, in the craniopharyngeal ectoderm involved in
palate formation and in the Rathke pouch, is transiently expressed at
these sites from embryonic day (E) 8-8.5 to E13.5. The mRNA encoding
TTF2 is downregulated in TFC precursors following their migration and
just before their differentiation (summary by De Felice et al., 1998).
De Felice et al. (1998) reported that Zannini et al. (1997) suggested
that TTF2 is involved either in promoting the migration process or in
repressing differentiation of the TFCs until migration has occurred.
Thus, De Felice et al. (1998) predicted that the absence of TTF2 would
result in alteration of thyroid primordium migration and/or precocious
functional differentiation.

Brancaccio et al. (2004) reported that Foxe1 was specifically expressed
in the lower undifferentiated compartment of hair follicles in mouse
skin, at a time and site that parallel activation of the Shh (600725)
signaling pathway. Foxe1 protein was also expressed in human and mouse
basal cell carcinoma in which hedgehog signaling is constitutively
activated, whereas it was undetectable in normal epidermis and squamous
cell carcinoma. Expression of a dominant-negative form of Gli2 (165230)
in mouse skin resulted in complete suppression of Foxe1 expression in
hair follicles, whereas transcriptionally active Gli2 stimulated
activity of the Foxe1 promoter. Foxe1-null skin that was grafted to
immunodeficient mice displayed thin and curly pelage hairs, as well as
disoriented, misaligned, and aberrantly shaped hair follicles.
Brancaccio et al. (2004) concluded that the defect in Bamforth-Lazarus
syndrome is due to altered FOXE1 function in the hair follicle and is
independent of systemic defects present in affected individuals. They
further hypothesized that Foxe1 is a downstream target of the Shh/Gli
pathway in hair follicle morphogenesis and plays a crucial role in
correct hair follicle orientation into the dermis and subcutis.

To gain insight into human thyroid development and thyroid
dysgenesis-associated malformations, Trueba et al. (2005) studied the
expression patterns of the PAX8, TITF1, and FOXE1 genes during human
development. PAX8 and TITF1 were first expressed in the median thyroid
primordium. Interestingly, PAX8 was also expressed in the thyroglossal
duct and the ultimobranchial bodies. Human FOXE1 expression was detected
later than in the mouse. PAX8 was also expressed in the developing
central nervous system and kidney, including the ureteric bud and the
main collecting ducts. TITF1 was expressed in the ventral forebrain and
lung. FOXE1 expression was detected in the oropharyngeal epithelium and
thymus. The expression patterns of these genes in human show some
differences from those reported in the mouse; Pax8, Titf1, and Foxe1 are
expressed in the mouse thyroid bud as soon as it differentiates on the
pharyngeal floor. The authors concluded that the expression patterns of
these 3 genes correlate well with the phenotypes observed in patients
carrying mutations of the corresponding gene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Hypothyroidism, Athyroidal, with Spiky Hair and Cleft Palate

Clifton-Bligh et al. (1998) demonstrated that the FKHL15 gene, which is
the human homolog of the mouse Titf2 gene, was homozygously mutated
(602617.0001) in 2 sibs with thyroid agenesis, cleft palate, and choanal
atresia, previously reported by Bamforth et al. (1989); see
Bamforth-Lazarus syndrome (241850). Spiky or curly hair was also a
feature, as was bifid epiglottis. Polyhydramnios, which was present in
the 2 pregnancies of the brothers and in another reported case of
Bamforth-Lazarus syndrome, may have been caused by the choanal atresia.

In 2 brothers with congenital hypothyroidism, athyreosis, and cleft
palate, Castanet et al. (2002) identified homozygosity for a missense
mutation in the FOXE1 gene (S57N; 602617.0002). The authors noted that
these patients had an incomplete clinical phenotype, lacking choanal
atresia and bifid epiglottis.

In a girl with Bamforth-Lazarus syndrome, Baris et al. (2006) identified
homozygosity for a missense mutation (R102C; 602617.0003) in the FOXE1
gene. The patient had congenital hypothyroidism, bilateral choanal
atresia, cleft palate, and spiky hair, but was not athyreotic.

- Thyroid Dysgenesis

Carre et al. (2007) analyzed FOXE1 alanine tract length in 115 patients
with thyroid dysgenesis (see CHNG1, 275200) and 129 controls. They found
that 16/16 and 16/14 genotypes were inversely associated with thyroid
dysgenesis (OR, 0.39; p = 0.0005), suggesting that FOXE1 with 16
alanines protects against occurrence of thyroid dysgenesis; the
protective effect was confirmed by transmission disequilibrium analysis
in 39 parent-proband trios. Conversely, the 14/14 genotype was
associated with an increased risk of thyroid dysgenesis (OR, 2.59; p =
0.0005). Expression studies showed that transcription activity of FOXE1
with 16 alanines was 1.55-fold higher than FOXE1 with 14 alanines (p
less than 0.003); nuclear localization of FOXE1 was not affected. Carre
et al. (2007) suggested that FOXE1 alanine tract length modulates
genetic susceptibility to thyroid dysgenesis.

- Nonsyndromic Orofacial Clefting

Nonsyndromic orofacial clefts are a common complex birth defect caused
by genetic and environmental factors and/or their interactions. In a
cohort of cleft lip and palate (CL/P; see 119530) families from
Colombia, United States, and the Philippines, Moreno et al. (2009)
tested 397 SNPs spanning 9q22-q33 for association. Significant SNP and
haplotype association signals narrowed the interval to a 200-kb region
containing FOXE1, C9ORF156, and HEMGN (610715). Association results were
replicated in CL/P families of European descent; when all populations
were combined, the 2 most associated SNPs, dbSNP rs3758249 (P =
5.01E-13) and dbSNP rs4460498 (P = 6.51E-12), were located inside a
70-kb high linkage disequilibrium block containing FOXE1. Association
signals for Caucasians and Asians clustered 5-prime and 3-prime of
FOXE1, respectively. Isolated cleft palate (CP) was also associated,
indicating that FOXE1 may play a role in 2 phenotypes thought to be
genetically distinct. Foxe1 expression was found in the epithelium
undergoing fusion between the medial nasal and maxillary processes.
Mutation screens of FOXE1 identified 2 family-specific missense
mutations (ile59 to ser and pro208 to arg) at highly conserved amino
acids. Although predicted to be benign by a computer program, both
mutations are near previously identified deleterious mutations. The
authors concluded that FOXE1 may be a major gene for CL/P and CP.

- Association with Thyroid Cancer

For a discussion of a possible association between variation in the
FOXE1 gene and thyroid cancer, see 188550 and 188470.

ANIMAL MODEL

Many members of the forkhead/winged-helix transcription factor family
are key regulators of embryogenesis (summary by Kaufmann and Knochel,
1996). Thyroid transcription factor-2 (TTF2), a forkhead
domain-containing transcription factor, was cloned by Zannini et al.
(1997) and the mouse gene, designated Titf2, was mapped to chromosome 4.
De Felice et al. (1998) showed that Titf2-null mutant mice exhibit cleft
palate and either a sublingual or completely absent thyroid gland. Thus,
the Titf2-/- mutation results in neonatal hypothyroidism that showed
similarity to thyroid dysgenesis in humans. Among the 1 in 3,000 or
4,000 newborns in which congenital hypothyroidism is detected, 80% have
either an ectopic, small and sublingual thyroid, or have no thyroid
tissue (Toublanc, 1992). Most of these cases appear sporadically,
although a few cases of recurring familial thyroid dysgenesis (218700)
have been reported.

HISTORY

By screening a human fetal brain cDNA library with the forkhead domain
of rat HNF3A (602294) as probe, Wiese et al. (1997) identified what they
considered to be a novel member of the forkhead family of transcription
factors, which they called HFKL5 and was later designated FOXE2 by the
HUGO gene nomenclature committee. As described by Wiese et al. (1997),
the full-length cDNA encodes a deduced 500-amino acid protein with a
calculated molecular mass of approximately 55 kD. The protein shows
little homology in the forkhead domain with other members of the
forkhead family. Northern blot analysis detected a 4.4-kb transcript in
all fetal and adult tissues tested. In situ hybridization studies
detected expression in differentiated fetal and adult neurons but not in
undifferentiated neurons, such as those in the periventricular matrix.
Expression was also detected in neuron-derived cells in various tissues,
such as the parasympathetic ganglia of the intestine, and in a subset of
hepatocytes, lymphatic tissue cells, and kidney tubule cells. Although
Wiese et al. (1997) stated that the HFKL5 gene maps to chromosome 22,
Scott (2007) found that this mapping is not supported by the human
genome build 36.2.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPOTHYROIDISM, ATHYROIDAL, WITH SPIKY HAIR AND CLEFT PALATE
FOXE1, ALA65VAL

In 2 brothers with a syndrome of thyroid agenesis, cleft palate, and
choanal atresia originally reported by Bamforth et al. (1989) (see
241850), Clifton-Bligh et al. (1998) identified homozygosity for a
missense mutation at nucleotide 196, causing an ala-to-val substitution
at codon 65 in the predicted structure of the TTF2 protein.

.0002
HYPOTHYROIDISM, ATHYROIDAL, WITH SPIKY HAIR AND CLEFT PALATE
FOXE1, SER57ASN

Castanet et al. (2002) described 2 male sibs, born to consanguineous
parents, with congenital hypothyroidism, athyreosis, and cleft palate
(see 241850). Unlike previous cases, these patients had an incomplete
clinical phenotype, lacking choanal atresia and bifid epiglottis. They
were homozygous for a 169G-A transition, which was predicted to result
in a ser57-to-asn (S57N) substitution in the forkhead DNA binding domain
of FOXE1. The mutant protein showed impaired DNA binding and partial
loss of transcriptional function.

.0003
HYPOTHYROIDISM, THYROIDAL, WITH SPIKY HAIR AND CLEFT PALATE
FOXE1, ARG102CYS

Baris et al. (2006) reported a female child with Bamforth-Lazarus
syndrome (241850) who presented with congenital hypothroidism, bilateral
choanal atresia, cleft palate, and spiky hair but who was not
athyreotic. Thyroid ultrasonography and computed tomography examination
indicated thyroid tissue in a eutopic location, although biochemical
measurements and radioisotope scanning showed that it was nonfunctional.
The child was homozygous for a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 304 that
resulted in an arginine-to-cysteine mutation at codon 102 (R102C), a
highly conserved residue within the forkhead DNA-binding domain of
FOXE1. Her consanguineous Turkish parents were unaffected heterozygotes,
and the mutation was not detected in 100 control chromosomes. Consonant
with its location, the R102C mutant FOXE1 protein showed loss of DNA
binding and was transcriptionally inactive.

;;IMMUNOGLOBULIN G Fc RECEPTOR III-2;;
FCRIII-2;;
CD16A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The Fc receptor with low affinity for IgG (FCGR3, or CD16) is encoded by
2 nearly identical genes, FCGR3A and FCGR3B (610665), resulting in
tissue-specific expression of alternative membrane-anchored isoforms.
FCGR3A encodes a transmembrane protein expressed on activated
monocytes/macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, and a subset of T
cells. In contrast, FCGR3B encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol
(GPI)-anchored protein that is expressed constitutively by neutrophils
and after gamma-interferon (IFNG; 147570) stimulation by eosinophils
(summary by Gessner et al., 1995).

CLONING

By Western blot and flow cytometric analyses, Ravetch and Perussia
(1989) demonstrated differential expression of FCGR3 on
polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and NK cells. The glycoprotein on
NK cells (FCGR3A) had a molecular mass 6 to 10 kD larger than that on
neutrophils (FCGR3B) and was resistant to phosphatidylinositol-specific
phospholipase C. Transcripts derived from FCGR3A and FCGR3B in NK cells
and PMNs, respectively, have multiple single nucleotide differences,
including 1 that converts a termination codon to a codon encoding arg,
thereby extending the cytoplasmic domain by 21 amino acids and
introducing a transmembrane anchor for FCGR3A in NK cells. The deduced
FCGR3A protein contains 254 amino acids, whereas the deduced FCGR3B
protein contains 233 amino acids. Ravetch and Perussia (1989) concluded
that cell type-specific expression of 2 genes encoding alternative FCGR3
proteins has a significant effect on the biologic functions of the
molecules.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gessner et al. (1995) isolated and sequenced genomic clones of FCGR3A
and FCGR3B, located their transcription initiation sites, identified the
different organizations of their 5-prime regions, and demonstrated 4
distinct classes of FCGR3A transcripts compared with a single class of
FCGR3B transcripts. The gene promoters displayed different
tissue-specific transcriptional activities reflecting expression of
FCGR3A in NK cells and FCGR3B in neutrophils.

MAPPING

Le Coniat et al. (1990) mapped the FCGR3A gene to chromosome 1q23 by in
situ hybridization.

GENE FUNCTION

Anderson et al. (1990) concluded that CD16 is included in the zeta
natural killer cell receptor complex (CD3Z; 186780).

Some gamma-delta T cells (see TCRG, 186970 and TCRD, 186810) express
CD16. Using flow cytometric analysis, Bodman-Smith et al. (2000)
examined the relative proportions of CD16+ gamma-delta T cells in the
blood and synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis (RA; 180300) patients
and the blood of control subjects. There was a significant reduction in
CD16+ gamma-delta T cells in synovial fluid compared with the
circulation. Mitogenic stimulation of circulating gamma-delta T cells
resulted in an increased expression of the HLA-DR activation marker and
a concomitant time-dependent decrease in the expression of CD16.
Bodman-Smith et al. (2000) concluded that CD16 expression is lost in the
synovial compartment as a result of activation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

On the natural killer (NK) cells of a 3-year-old boy who suffered from
recurrent viral respiratory tract infections since birth, de Vries et
al. (1996) found an unusual CD16 phenotype. The child also had severe
clinical problems with BCG vaccination and after Epstein-Barr virus and
varicella-zoster virus infections. His peripheral blood lymphocytes
contained a normal percentage and absolute number of CD3(-)CD7(+) cells,
which were positively stained with CD16 monoclonal antibodies. FCGR3
expression on granulocytes appeared to be normal. Sequence analysis of
the FCGR3A gene, encoding CD16 on NK cells and macrophages, showed a
T-to-A nucleotide substitution at position 230 on both alleles,
predicting a leucine to histidine amino acid change at position 48
(146740.0002).

By cloning and sequencing FCGR3A cDNA from NK cells and macrophages of a
heterozygous donor, de Haas et al. (1996) identified a 230T-G SNP that
resulted in a leu48-to-arg (L48R) substitution in the first
extracellular Ig-like domain and caused a higher electrophoretic
mobility of deglycosylated FCGR3A. PCR and restriction analysis
identified a 230T-A SNP, resulting in a leu48-to-his (L48H)
substitution, in another donor. Genotype analysis revealed a gene
frequency of 86% for 230T (L48), 6% for 230G (R48), and 8% for 230A
(H48) in 93 FCGR3B-positive individuals. In contrast, the frequency of
the 230G allele was significantly higher in 12 FCGR3B-deficient donors.
The H48 and R48 variants exhibited a higher binding capacity for IgG1,
IgG3, and IgG4 than did the common L48 variant. De Haas et al. (1996)
concluded that SNPs at position 230 of FCGR3A influence IgG binding, as
well as reactivity of CD16 monoclonal antibodies.

Koene et al. (1997) used PCR-based restriction analysis to genotype 87
donors for a 559T-G SNP in FCGR3A that results in a phe158-to-val
(F158V) substitution. They found gene frequencies of 57% and 43% for
F158 and V158, respectively. F158 was linked to L48, and V158 was linked
to R48 or H48. Through functional analysis, Koene et al. (1997)
determined that the previously identified differences in IgG binding
among the 3 FCGR3A variants at position 48 are a consequence of the
linked polymorphism at position 158.

Among 1,115 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA; 180300) and 654
controls, Robinson et al. (2012) found no significant association
between FCGR3A copy number and disease.

Although nearly all adults have been exposed to herpes simplex virus
(HSV)-1, the clinical course of infection varies remarkably. By
analyzing the contribution of gene families on chromosomes 1, 6, 12, and
19 to susceptibility to HSV-1 infection in 302 individuals, Moraru et
al. (2012) identified no specific susceptibility locus. However, they
found that the risk of suffering clinical HSV-1 infection was modified
by MHC class I allotypes, HLA-C1 (142840) interaction with KIR2DL2
(604937), and the phe/val polymorphism at codon 158 of CD16A.

EVOLUTION

By determining the nature and rate of copy number variation (CNV)
mutation and investigating the global variation of disease-associated
variation at the FCGR locus, Machado et al. (2012) determined that CNV
of the FCGR3 genes is mediated by recurrent nonallelic homologous
recombination between the 2 segmental duplications that carry FCGR3A and
FCGR3B. They showed that pathogen richness, particularly helminth
pathogens, is likely to have influenced the patterns of variation in
FCGRs in humans. Machado et al. (2012) proposed that alterations to IgG
binding in the context of helminth infection have driven positive
selection in FCGR among different mammalian species, linking
evolutionary pressure of helminth infection with autoimmune disease via
adaptation at the genetic level. This model supports the 'hygiene
hypothesis,' which states that in the absence of chronic helminth
infection in modern populations, previously selected alleles respond to
immune system challenges differently and therefore may alter
susceptibility to autoimmune disease.

ANIMAL MODEL

Pinheiro da Silva et al. (2007) found that Fcrg (FCER1G; 147139) -/-
mice showed reduced mortality in an acute peritonitis model caused by
cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) compared with wildtype mice. The
reduced mortality in Fcrg -/- mice was associated with lower serum and
peritoneal Tnf (191160) and significantly increased capacity of
neutrophils and macrophages to phagocytose E. coli. Fcgr3 -/- mice also
had reduced sepsis after CLP. Fcgr3 bound E. coli, inducing Fcrg
phosphorylation, recruitment of tyrosine phosphatase Shp1 (PTPN6;
176883), and dephosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K;
see 171834). Decreased Pi3k activity inhibited E. coli phagocytosis and
increased Tnf production through Tlr4 (603030). Confocal microscopy
demonstrated negative regulation of Marco (604870) by Fcrg. Interaction
of E. coli with Fcgr3 induced recruitment of Shp1 to Marco and inhibited
E. coli phagocytosis. Pinheiro da Silva et al. (2007) concluded that
binding of E. coli to FCGR3 triggers an inhibitory FCRG pathway that
impairs MARCO-mediated bacterial clearance and activates TNF secretion.

In a 3-year-old boy who had suffered from recurrent viral respiratory
tract infections since birth, de Vries et al. (1996) found an unusual
CD16 phenotype on the natural killer (NK) cells. Sequence analysis of
the IGFR3 gene showed a T-to-A nucleotide substitution at position 230
on both alleles, predicting a leucine-to-histidine amino acid change at
position 48 in the first extracellular Ig-like domain of the FCGR3A
protein. The child had also had severe problems with BCG vaccination and
with Epstein-Barr virus and varicella-zoster virus infections. The
clinical pattern was considered compatible with an in vivo dysfunction
of NK cells. Only 1 patient with absolute NK cell deficiency had been
previously described. Biron et al. (1989) reported the case of an
adolescent with recurrent life-threatening herpesvirus infections, who
completely lacked CD16 and/or CD56 positive cells in vivo and
NK-activity in vitro. In a note added in proof, de Vries et al. (1996)
called attention to the case of homozygosity for a IGFR3 mutation
reported by Jawahar et al. (1996).
