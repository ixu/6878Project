604267	TITLE *604267 MULTIPLE EPIDERMAL GROWTH FACTOR-LIKE DOMAINS 8; MEGF8
;;EPIDERMAL GROWTH FACTOR-LIKE 4, FORMERLY; EGFL4, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The domain that characterizes epidermal growth factor (EGF; 131530)
consists of approximately 50 amino acids with 3 disulfide bonds.
EGF-like domains are believed to play a critical role in a number of
extracellular events, including cell adhesion and receptor-ligand
interactions. Proteins with EGF-like domains often consist of more than
1,000 amino acids, have multiple copies of the EGF-like domain, and
contain additional domains known to be involved in specific
protein-protein interactions. To identify proteins containing EGF-like
domains, Nakayama et al. (1998) searched a database of long cDNA
sequences randomly selected from a human brain cDNA library for those
that encode an EGF-like motif. They identified several partial cDNAs
encoding novel proteins with EGF-like domains, such as EGFL4, which they
named MEGF8. The predicted partial EGFL4 protein has a laminin (e.g.,
150240)-type EGF-like domain, 5 EGF-like domains, and a transmembrane
domain.

MAPPING

Using a radiation hybrid mapping panel, Nakayama et al. (1998) mapped
the EGFL4 gene to 19q12.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 4 unrelated probands with a form of Carpenter syndrome frequently
associated with defective lateralization (CRPT2; 614976), Twigg et al.
(2012) identified homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the
MEGF8 gene (see, e.g., 604267.0001-604267.0004).

ANIMAL MODEL

Using N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis in mice, Zhang et al.
(2009) found a recessive phenotype characterized by heterotaxy, complex
congenital heart defects, and preaxial polydactyly that was associated
with a cys193-to-arg (C193R) substitution in the Megf8 gene on mouse
chromosome 7. The authors used massively parallel sequencing to identify
the mutation. The substitution eliminated an invariant cysteine situated
in the second putative EGF domain and could disrupt formation of a
disulfide bond required for proper protein folding. Megf8 transcripts
were ubiquitously expressed in both wildtype and mutant mouse embryos.
Immunostaining showed punctate nuclear localization with Gfi1b (604383)
and Baf60c (SMARCD3; 601737), 2 proteins involved in chromatin
remodeling. Mutant mice showed normal breaking of symmetry at the node,
but Nodal (601265) signaling failed to be propagated to the left lateral
plate mesoderm. Cilia motility was unaffected. Morpholino knockdown of
Megf8 in zebrafish embryos resulted in a heterotaxic phenotype with
discordant heart and gut situs. The findings suggested that MEGF8 is an
essential regulator of left-right patterning.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CARPENTER SYNDROME 2
MEGF8, ARG1499HIS

In a 9-year-old Turkish boy with features of Carpenter syndrome and
dextrocardia (CRPT2; 614976), Twigg et al. (2012) identified
homozygosity for a 4496G-A transition in exon 26 of the MEGF8 gene,
resulting in an arg1499-to-his (R1499H) substitution at a highly
conserved residue in a kelch domain. The mutation was present in
heterozygosity in his unaffected parents and sister, but was not found
in the dbSNP135 or Exome Variant Server databases. In zebrafish
morpholino knockdown experiments, coinjection of the R1499H mutant did
not result in effective rescue compared to wildtype, but the reduced
proportion of epiboly defects (down to 60% from 83%) suggested that the
mutant protein might retain some residual function.

.0002
CARPENTER SYNDROME 2
MEGF8, SER2367GLY

In a 6.5-year-old German girl with features of Carpenter syndrome
(CRPT2; 614976), Twigg et al. (2012) identified compound heterozygosity
for a missense and a nonsense mutation in the MEGF8 gene: a 7099A-G
transition in exon 41, resulting in a ser2367-to-gly (S2367G)
substitution at a highly conserved residue in an EGF-like laminin
domain, and a 1342C-T transition in exon 7, resulting in an
arg448-to-ter (R448X; 604267.0002) substitution. The patient's
unaffected father was heterozygous for the S367G mutation, which was not
found in 192 northern European controls, and her unaffected mother was
heterozygous for the R448X mutation, which was not found in 189 Turkish
controls; neither mutation was found in the dbSNP135 or Exome Variant
Server databases. In zebrafish morpholino knockdown experiments,
coinjection of the S236G mutant did not result in effective rescue
compared to wildtype, but the reduced proportion of epiboly defects
(down to 71% from 83%) suggested that the mutant protein might retain
some residual function.

CARPENTER SYNDROME 2
MEGF8, GLY199ARG

In a Turkish boy with features of Carpenter syndrome who also exhibited
dextrocardia and situs inversus totalis (CRPT2; 604267), originally
reported by Altunhan et al. (2011), Twigg et al. (2012) identified
homozygosity for a 595G-C transversion in exon 4 of the MEGF8 gene,
resulting in a gly199-to-arg (G199R) substitution at a highly conserved
residue in an EGF domain. The proband's unaffected father and 2
unaffected sisters were heterozygous for the mutation, which was not
found in 189 Turkish controls or in the dbSNP135 or Exome Variant Server
databases; his mother was deceased. In zebrafish morpholino knockdown
experiments, coinjection of the G199R mutant did not result in effective
rescue compared to wildtype, but the reduced proportion of epiboly
defects (down to 73% from 83%) suggested that the mutant protein might
retain some residual function.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DPEP1 (EC 3.4.13.11) is a kidney membrane enzyme that hydrolyzes a
variety of dipeptides and is implicated in renal metabolism of
glutathione and its conjugates, e.g., leukotriene D4 (Kozak and Tate,
1982). DPEP1 is responsible for hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring of
antibiotics, such as penem and carbapenem (Campbell et al., 1984).
Earlier, beta-lactamase enzymes were thought to occur only in bacteria,
where their probable function was in protecting the organisms against
the action of beta-lactam antibiotics. These antibiotics exhibit
selective toxicity against bacteria but virtual inertness against many
eukaryotic cells (Adachi et al., 1990).

CLONING

Adachi et al. (1990) isolated and characterized cDNA clones for human
DPEP1, which they called RDP. DNA and RNA blot analysis indicated the
existence of a single gene.

To isolate potential tumor/growth suppressor genes involved in Wilms
tumor, Austruy et al. (1993) constructed a cDNA library by cloning a
mature kidney cDNA subtracted with an excess of Wilms tumor mRNA. Clones
were selected according to a differential pattern of expression, i.e.,
positive with RNA from mature kidney and negative with RNA from several
Wilms tumors. By comparison of sequences of these clones with database
sequences, 1 clone was identified as DPEP1.

Nitanai et al. (2002) stated that RDP is a homodimer of identical
369-amino acid subunits. Each subunit has a calculated molecular mass of
about 42 kD, but N-glycosylation at 4 possible sites results in a highly
glycosylated peptide of about 63 kD. In addition, each RDP subunit has a
C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol membrane anchor.

Habib et al. (2003) cloned mouse Dpep1, which they designated Mbd1.
Northern blot analysis detected 3 transcripts that were differentially
expressed in heart, lung, skeletal muscle, kidney, liver, and testis. No
Mbd1 expression was detected in brain and spleen. The transcripts likely
arise from the use of alternate poly(A) sites and variations in the
5-prime UTR.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Nitanai et al. (2002) determined the crystal structure of human RDP.
Each subunit appears to assume a barrel shape made up of 8 alpha helix
and beta sheet pairs. Each monomer requires 2 zinc ions that are ligated
to the catalytic residues (glu125, his198, and his219) at the bottom of
the enzymatic pocket. His152 is not ligated to zinc, but it is
responsible for recognition of a substrate or inhibitor. The pocket is
reinforced by 2 adjacent disulfide bonds and by 3 proline residues.
Cys361 is involved in a disulfide bridge between monomers.

GENE FUNCTION

Kera et al. (1999) measured dipeptidase activity in several human
postmortem tissues and in rat tissues using glycyl-D-alanine as
substrate. Highest activity in human tissues was detected in kidney
cortex, pancreas, and testis. Much lower activity was detected in
adrenal gland and liver, and very low activity was detected in lung,
spleen, cerebrum, and cerebellum. The enzyme was also found in serum and
urine from healthy volunteers. Activity in rats was similar, but was
much higher in lung. The distribution of enzyme activity in various
tissues changed in postnatal rats up to 8 weeks of age.

Habib et al. (2003) demonstrated that COS-7 cells transfected with mouse
Mbd1 were able to convert leukotriene D4 to leukotriene E4 and could
hydrolyze cystinyl-bis-glycine (cys-bis-gly) and beta-lactam. Inhibition
of Mbd1 by penicillamine indicated that it is a metallopeptidase.

GENE STRUCTURE

Satoh et al. (1993) determined that the DPEP1 gene contains 10 exons and
spans about 6 kb.

MAPPING

By FISH, Nakagawa et al. (1991) mapped the RDP gene to chromosome 16q24.

Austruy et al. (1993) used somatic cell hybrids carrying either
different human chromosomes or chromosome 16 segments to confirm and
refine the physical mapping of DPEP1 to 16q24.3. Two RFLPs were
described and used to show linkage of DPEP1 to D16S7; maximum lod score
was 5.8 at theta of 0.03.

ANIMAL MODEL

Habib et al. (1998) found that Mbd1-deficient mice retained partial
ability to degrade cys-bis-gly and to convert leukotriene D4 to
leukotriene E4 depending on the tissue examined. Habib et al. (2003)
suggested that tissue- and substrate-specific activities of Mbd2 (DPEP2;
609925) and Mbd3 (DPEP3; 609926) partially compensate for the loss of
Mbd1 in these mice.

613753	TITLE *613753 MICRO RNA 211; MIR211
;;miRNA211;;
MIRN211
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), such as MIR211, are small noncoding RNAs that
commonly basepair with sequences in the 3-prime UTRs of target mRNAs and
either inhibit mRNA translation or cause mRNA destabilization (Krol et
al., 2010).

CLONING

Krol et al. (2010) found that Mir211, Mir204 (610942), and the Mir183
(611608)/Mir96 (611606)/Mir182 (611607) cluster were highly expressed in
mouse retina. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that expression of Mir204 and
Mir211 was enriched in the microdissected inner nuclear layer, whereas
the Mir183/Mir9/Mir182 cluster was most abundant in photoreceptors.

GENE FUNCTION

Using expression arrays and quantitative RT-PCR, Krol et al. (2010)
showed that expression of Mir211, Mir204, and the Mir183/Mir96/Mir182
cluster was reversibly up- and downregulated in mouse retina during
light and dark adaptation, respectively. Increased accumulation of these
miRNAs upon light adaptation occurred independently of circadian rhythm.
The half-lives of these and other miRNAs appeared to be much shorter in
retinal neurons than in rod bipolar cells or Muller glia cells. Similar
rapid miRNA decay was observed in cultured rodent neurons and mouse
embryonic stem cell-derived neurons. Inhibitor studies revealed that
miRNA turnover was stimulated by neuronal activity.

Chen et al. (2010) found that miR211 regulates the vascular endothelial
growth factor angiopoietin-1 (ANGPT1; 601667).

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the MIR211 gene to chromosome 15q13.3 based on an
alignment of the mature MIR211 sequence (UUCCCUUUGUCAUCCUUCGCCU) with
the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

Krol et al. (2010) noted that the mouse Mir211 gene is located within an
intron of the Trpm1 gene (603576).

601572	TITLE *601572 CAPPING PROTEIN, BETA; CAPZB
;;CAP PROTEIN, ACTIN, BETA; CAPPB
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

CapZ was identified in chicken as an actin-binding protein composed of
alpha (see 601580) and beta subunits. From a human retina cDNA library,
Barron-Casella et al. (1995) isolated cDNAs homologous for the beta
subunit of chicken CapZ.

MAPPING

Barron-Casella et al. (1995) mapped the CAPZB gene to chromosome 1p36.1
by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

HISTORY

In the course of mapping 39 ESTs on chromosome 6p24-p23, Olavesen et al.
(1997) concluded that CAPZB is located in that region flanked by EDN1
(131240) on the centromeric side and TFAP2 (107580) on the telomeric
side. However, Cooper (1999) stated that a 'simple clerical error'
occurred at the outset of this project; the EST in question does not
share sequence similarity with the CAPZB gene and, therefore, the
mapping of the CAPZB gene to chromosome 6p24-p23 is incorrect.

171640	TITLE *171640 PHOSPHATASE, ACID, TYPE 5, TARTRATE-RESISTANT; ACP5
;;TARTRATE-RESISTANT ACID PHOSPHATASE; TRAP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Ketcham et al. (1988) cloned a full-length cDNA for type 5
tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase from human placenta and found that
it contained an open reading frame of 969 basepairs (corresponding to a
protein of 323 amino acids), a putative signal sequence of 19 amino
acids, and 2 potential glycosylation sites. The deduced amino acid
sequence of the human isozyme is 85% identical to the amino acid
sequence of porcine uteroferrin and 82% identical to the corresponding
regions of a partial amino acid sequence of the bovine spleen enzyme.
The type 5 isozyme of acid phosphatase is the most basic of the acid
phosphatases and is the only form insensitive to inhibition by
L(+)-tartrate. Normally, it is detected as a minor intracellular
component of spleen, lung, liver, and bone. High levels of acid
phosphatase-5 are found within the spleen and monocytes of patients with
Gaucher disease (230800). The type 5 isozyme is an iron-containing
glycoprotein with a molecular mass of approximately 34 kD.

Lord et al. (1990) also isolated a clone for ACP5, which is found
principally in resident tissue macrophages. They found that an ACP5 cDNA
clone contained an open reading frame of 975 bp, encoded a protein of
325 amino acids, including a single peptide of 19 residues and 2
potential sites for N-glycosylation.

MAPPING

Allen et al. (1989) assigned the ACP5 gene to 15q22-q26 by in situ
hybridization both to normal metaphase chromosomes and to the
chromosomes of an individual carrying an unbalanced translocation
involving chromosome 15. However, Grimes et al. (1993) showed that the
Acp5 gene maps to mouse chromosome 9 in a group of genes that are
homologous to a group of genes on 19p13.3-p13.1. By Southern blot
analysis of somatic cell hybrids and use of a PCR method, Leach et al.
(1994) confirmed the assignment of ACP5 to chromosome 19. By isotopic in
situ hybridization, Lord et al. (1990) mapped the APC5 gene to
19p13.3-p13.2 with a peak at 19p13.2.

GENE FUNCTION

Lord et al. (1990) found that the expression of ACP5 mRNA was restricted
to mononuclear phagocytes and that the enzyme was induced more than
20-fold on transformation of normal human monocytes to macrophages by
culture in serum-supplemented medium.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 10 patients with spondyloenchondrodysplasia with immune dysregulation
(SPENCDI; 607944) from 8 families, Briggs et al. (2011) identified
homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for mutations in the ACP5 gene
(see, e.g., 171640.0001-171640.0004). In vivo testing confirmed a loss
of expressed protein, and all 8 cases assayed showed elevated serum
interferon alpha (see IFNA1, 147660) activity, with gene expression
profiling in whole blood defining a type I interferon signature.

Simultaneously and independently, Lausch et al. (2011) mapped SPENCDI to
chromosome 19p13 and identified homozygous or compound heterozygous
mutations in the ACP5 gene in 14 affected individuals from 11 families
(see, e.g., 171640.0004-171640.0007). Lausch et al. (2011) demonstrated
that the mutations abolished TRAP enzyme function in serum and cells of
affected individuals, and that phosphorylated osteopontin accumulated in
serum, urine, and cells cultured from TRAP-deficient individuals.
Case-derived dendritic cells exhibited an altered cytokine profile and
were more potent than matched controls in stimulating allogeneic T-cell
proliferation in mixed lymphocyte reactions.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hayman et al. (1996) observed that mice with a targeted disruption of
the Acp5 gene, or Trap, suffered from developmental deformities of the
limb and axial skeleton and had osteoclasts defective in bone
resorption, resulting in mild osteopetrosis.

Bune et al. (2001) determined that macrophages of Acp5-deficient mice
had compensatory acid phosphatase activity attributable to the Acp2 gene
(171650) and enhanced proinflammatory responses in vitro. However, mice
lacking Acp5 showed delayed clearance of Staphylococcus aureus in vivo,
which was associated with reduced numbers of peritoneal macrophages, in
spite of normal macrophage and neutrophil phagocytosis and killing in
vitro.

SPONDYLOENCHONDRODYSPLASIA WITH IMMUNE DYSREGULATION
ACP5, THR89ILE

In a Turkish brother and sister with spondyloenchondrodysplasia and
immune dysregulation (607944), born of first-cousin parents, Briggs et
al. (2011) identified homozygosity for a 266C-T transition in exon 4 of
the ACP5 gene, resulting in a thr89-to-ile (T89I) substitution at a
highly conserved residue. The brother, who was previously reported by
Navarro et al. (2008), presented at age 22 months with spasticity and a
vasculitic skin rash. Upon evaluation at 11 years of age, plasma levels
of total TRAP protein were negligible and TRAP 5a protein was
undetectable, and he had spasticity and intracranial calcifications,
elevated antinuclear antibody and anti-double-stranded DNA antibody
titers, and hypocomplementemia. His older sister, who was evaluated at
14 years of age for short stature, had a history of Raynaud phenomenon
but did not have elevated ANA or anti-dsDNA titers; she was, however,
found to have a high level of interferon-alpha (147660) in serum.

In an 11-year-old Pakistani boy with spondyloenchondrodysplasia and
immune dysregulation (607944), born of first-cousin parents and
previously reported by Renella et al. (2006) as 'patient 10' (Crow,
2011), Briggs et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for a 667C-T
transition in the ACP5 gene, resulting in a gln223-to-ter (Q223X)
substitution. Plasma levels of total TRAP protein were negligible and
TRAP 5a protein was undetectable in this patient, indicating an almost
complete lack of TRAP synthesis or secretion. In addition to skeletal
manifestations, the patient had elevated antinuclear antibody and
anti-double-stranded DNA antibody titers and autoimmune hemolytic
anemia.

SPONDYLOENCHONDRODYSPLASIA WITH IMMUNE DYSREGULATION
ACP5, MET264LYS

In a female patient with spondyloenchondrodysplasia and immune
dysregulation (607944), who was born of first-cousin parents of
Portuguese descent and was originally reported by Roifman and Melamed
(2003), Briggs et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for a 791T-A
transversion in exon 7 of the ACP5 gene, resulting in a met264-to-lys
(M264K) substitution. Computational analysis indicated that this change
was likely to destabilize the structure of the protein. In addition to
skeletal changes, the patient had a history of recurrent infections,
elevated antinuclear antibody and anti-double-stranded DNA antibody
titers, thrombocytopenia requiring splenectomy, nonerosive arthropathy,
systemic lupus erythematosus, and hypothyroidism.

SPONDYLOENCHONDRODYSPLASIA WITH IMMUNE DYSREGULATION
ACP5, GLY215ARG

In a female patient from Mali with spondyloenchondrodysplasia and immune
dysregulation (607944), Briggs et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for
a 643G-A transition in exon 6 of the ACP5 gene, resulting in a
gly215-to-arg (G215R) substitution. This patient, who presented at 6
years of age with nephropathy, also had severe short stature with
metaphyseal dysplasia, elevated antinuclear antibody and
anti-double-stranded DNA antibody titers, and systemic lupus
erythematosus with class V lupus nephritis on renal biopsy.

In 2 unrelated girls with spondyloenchondrodysplasia, 14 years and 10
years of age, respectively, Lausch et al. (2011) identified homozygosity
for the G215R mutation in the ACP5 gene. In addition to skeletal
changes, the older girl had chronic thrombocytopenia, ataxia,
leukodystrophy, and basal ganglia calcifications, whereas the younger
girl had only calcifications of the left globus pallidus without
immunologic or neurologic symptoms. The mutation was not found in 228
control alleles.

SPONDYLOENCHONDRODYSPLASIA WITH IMMUNE DYSREGULATION
ACP5, GLY109ARG

In 2 sibs with spondyloenchondrodysplasia and immune dysregulation
(607944), Lausch et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for a 325G-A
transition in exon 7 of the ACP5 gene, resulting in a gly109-to-arg
(G109R) substitution. In addition to skeletal changes, both sibs had
systemic lupus erythematosus, the older sib also had arthralgia and
vitiligo, and the younger sib had arthritis; the older sib also had mild
developmental delay and diffuse intracranial calcifications as well as
of the basal ganglia, and the younger sib had basal ganglia and right
frontal lobe calcifications, but neither sib displayed neurologic signs.
In 2 additional affected individuals from unrelated families, 1 of whom
was the patient originally reported by Scharer (1958), Lausch et al.
(2011) identified compound heterozygosity for the G109R mutation and
another mutation in the ACP5 gene (see 171640.0006 and 171640.0007).
None of the mutations was found in 228 control alleles.

SPONDYLOENCHONDRODYSPLASIA WITH IMMUNE DYSREGULATION
ACP5, 3-BP DEL, 831CTA

In a 64-year-old Ashkenazi Jewish man with spondyloenchondrodysplasia
and immune dysregulation (607944), who was originally reported by
Scharer (1958) and later studied by Renella et al. (2006), Lausch et al.
(2011) identified compound heterozygosity for mutations in the ACP5
gene: a 3-bp deletion (813delCTA) in exon 7 and a G109R substitution
(171640.0005). The patient was diagnosed with systemic lupus
erythematosus at 9.5 years of age but was subsequently lost to
follow-up; the diagnosis of spondyloenchondrodysplasia was made 40 years
later upon reevaluation of his radiographs. In adulthood he had
continued to have recurrent fevers and arthralgias and developed
antiphospholipid syndrome, steroid-dependent neutropenia, and
thrombocytopenia.

SPONDYLOENCHONDRODYSPLASIA WITH IMMUNE DYSREGULATION
ACP5, LEU201PRO

In a 12-year-old patient with spondyloenchondrodysplasia and immune
dysregulation (607944), Lausch et al. (2011) identified compound
heterozygosity for mutations in the ACP5 gene: a 602T-C transition in
exon 6, resulting in a leu201-to-pro (L201P) substitution, and a G109R
substitution (171640.0005). In addition to skeletal manifestations, the
patient had thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, elevated
antinuclear antibody titers, childhood-onset spastic diplegia, and
calcification of the basal ganglia and frontal subcortical area.

604026	TITLE *604026 GOLGI SNAP RECEPTOR COMPLEX MEMBER 1; GOSR1
;;GOS28;;
GOLGI SNARE, 28-KD; GS28
DESCRIPTION The specificity of vesicular transport is thought to be determined by
correct pairing of vesicle-associated SNAREs (v-SNAREs) with those on
the target membrane (t-SNAREs). This complex then recruits soluble NSF
attachment proteins (SNAPs) and N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF;
601633) to form a 20S fusion (or SNARE) complex. See SNAPA (603215).
Nagahama et al. (1996) identified GOS28, a putative Golgi v-SNARE of 28
kD that localized primarily to transport vesicles at the terminal rims
of Golgi stacks. They demonstrated that GOS28 plays a role in
intra-Golgi transport. Subramaniam et al. (1996) isolated cDNAs encoding
rat GOS28, which they called p28 or GS28 (Golgi SNARE of 28 kD).
Sequence analysis revealed that the predicted protein contained a
central coiled-coil domain and a C-terminal membrane anchor. The authors
found that GS28 is a core component of the Golgi 20S SNARE complex that
participates in the docking or fusion stage of endoplasmic
reticulum-Golgi transport. Lowe et al. (1997) reported that GS28 plays a
role in transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cis- (inside
face) and medial-Golgi, while the GS27 (604027) Golgi SNARE participates
in protein movement from the medial-Golgi towards the trans- Golgi
(plasma-membrane face) and the trans-Golgi network.

By searching EST databases using the rat GS28 protein sequence, Bui et
al. (1999) identified human GS28 cDNAs. The deduced 250-amino acid human
protein is 97% identical to rat GS28. Independently, Mao et al. (1998)
identified a human GOS28 cDNA among a collection of cDNAs expressed in
hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells.

By analysis of radiation hybrids and by fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Bui et al. (1999) mapped the GS28 gene to 17q11.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Long-chain acyl-CoA thioesterases (EC 3.1.2.2), such as ACOT7, are found
in all organisms and cleave fatty acyl-CoAs into free fatty acids and
CoA.

CLONING

Engberg et al. (1997) purified a liver cytosolic isoform of long-chain
acyl-CoA thioesterase from peroxisome proliferator-treated rats and
named it CTE-II for 'cytosolic long-chain acyl-CoA thioesterase.'
Antibodies against CTE-II were used to screen an expression library of
peroxisome proliferator-induced rat liver cDNA. The predicted 338-amino
acid protein migrated at 40 kD on SDS-PAGE. Engberg et al. (1997)
observed many evenly distributed nucleotide differences and pronounced
differences in the C-terminal regions between CTE-II and the closely
related ACT (602586) and suggested that the 2 enzymes are encoded by
different genes. Engberg et al. (1997) noted that there are human ESTs
homologous to CTE-II.

Yamada et al. (1997) isolated cDNAs encoding long-chain acyl-CoA
hydrolases from rat brain and liver cDNA libraries and designated the
clones Bach and Lach, respectively. Since the nucleotide sequences of
the N-terminal regions were entirely different but the downstream
sequences were virtually identical, Yamada et al. (1997) suggested that
Bach and Lach are derived from the same gene by alternative splicing.

Using a rat Bach cDNA to screen a human brain cDNA library, Yamada et
al. (1999) cloned BACH. The deduced protein contains 338 amino acids and
shares 95% identity with rat Bach. Northern blot analysis detected a
1.9-kb BACH transcript in human brain RNA. Biochemical analysis of human
brain homogenates showed that BACH is a cytosolic enzyme. SDS-PAGE
detected BACH at 43 kD, but gel filtration detected BACH at about 100
kD, indicating that the protein forms multimers.

By 5-prime RACE and RT-PCR of human brain total RNA, Yamada et al.
(2002) identified 6 BACH splice variants. Four variants, designated
BACHa to BACHd, differ in their use of 1 of 4 alternate first exons
(exons 1a through 1d, respectively) and encode proteins of 329 to 380
amino acids. All 4 of these proteins contain the hydrolase domain and a
bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) in their C-terminal halves,
and BACHb and BACHc have N-terminal mitochondrial localization signals.
The 2 remaining variants contain exon X, an alternatively spliced exon
between exons 7 and 8 that causes a frameshift and introduces a
premature stop codon. These C-terminally truncated proteins of 246 and
283 amino acids lack the hydrolase domain and NLS. The BACH proteins
containing the mitochondrial localization signal were detected in
mitochondria of transfected mouse neuroblastoma cells, but those
containing only the NLS did not localize to nuclei, even though the
isolated NLS was functional when fused to a test protein.
Immunohistochemical analysis of human brain detected BACHa in the
cytosol of neurons such as pyramidal cells in the cerebral cortex and
Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. In mouse brain, Bacha was also
detected in nuclei as well as cytosol of certain large neurons in the
cerebellum, medulla oblongata, and spinal cord. Yamada et al. (2002)
suggested that the NLS of BACH may be masked by the full-length protein
as a regulatory mechanism.

GENE FUNCTION

Yamada et al. (1997) found that bacterial extracts of E. coli expressing
either rat Bach or Lach cDNAs had 100-fold higher acyl-CoA hydrolase
activity, demonstrating that both cDNAs encode long-chain acyl-CoA
hydrolases.

By analyzing the activity of purified BACH against several fatty
acyl-CoAs, Yamada et al. (1999) found that BACH showed a relatively
broad specificity, with acyl-CoAs with carbon chains of C8 to C18 being
good substrates. BACH activity was inhibited by a sulfhydryl blocking
agent. Recombinant BACH was also active against palmitoyl-CoA.

Yang et al. (2004) found significantly decreased levels of acyl-CoA
hydrolase in hippocampal tissue from 5 patients with mesial temporal
lobe epilepsy (608096) compared to controls.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yamada et al. (2002) determined that the ACOT7 gene contains 13 exons,
including 4 alternative first exons (exons 1a through 1d) and exon X, an
alternatively spliced exon between exons 7 and 8. The gene spans 129 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Yamada et al. (1999) mapped the ACOT7 gene
to chromosome 1p36.2. Hunt et al. (2005) stated that the human ACOT7
gene maps to chromosome 1p36.31-p36.11 and the mouse Acot7 gene maps to
chromosome 4E2.

NOMENCLATURE

Hunt et al. (2005) noted that acyl-CoA thioesterases are referred to in
the literature as acyl-CoA hydrolases, but the reaction catalyzed is the
cleavage of a thioester bond. They presented a revised nomenclature for
these enzymes using the name acyl-CoA thioesterase and the root gene
symbol ACOT.

602224	TITLE *602224 EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 4E-BINDING PROTEIN 2; EIF4EBP2
;;4EBP2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Pause et al. (1994) reported that the 4EBP2 gene encodes a 120-amino
acid polypeptide that is 56% identical to that of 4EBP1 (602223). By
Northern blot analysis, Tsukiyama-Kohara et al. (1996) showed that a
major 3.5-kb transcript of 4EBP2 is expressed ubiquitously.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tsukiyama-Kohara et al. (1996) analyzed the genomic structure of the
mouse EIF4EBP2 gene and showed that it consists of 3 exons and spans 20
kb. Its intron/exon structure is identical to that of EIF4EBP1.

Colina et al. (2008) showed that translational control is critical for
induction of type I interferon (see 147570) production. In mouse
embryonic fibroblasts lacking the translational repressors 4Ebp1 and
4Ebp2, the threshold for eliciting type I interferon production is
lowered. Consequently, replication of encephalomyocarditis virus,
vesicular stomatitis virus, influenza virus, and Sindbis virus is
markedly suppressed. Furthermore, Colina et al. (2008) showed that mice
with both 4Ebp1 and 4Ebp2 genes knocked out are resistant to vesicular
stomatitis virus infection, and this correlates with an enhanced type I
interferon production in plasmacytoid dendritic cells and the expression
of interferon-regulated genes in the lungs. The enhanced type I
interferon response of 4Ebp1 -/- 4Ebp2 -/- double knockout mouse
embryonic fibroblasts is caused by upregulation of interferon regulatory
factor-7 (Irf7; 605047) mRNA translation. Colina et al. (2008) found
that their findings highlighted the role of 4EBPs as negative regulators
of type I interferon production, via translational repression of IRF7
mRNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Dowling et al. (2010) inhibited the mTORC1 (601231) pathway in cells
lacking EIF4EBP1, EIF4EBP2, and EIF4EBP3 (603483) and analyzed the
effects on cell size, cell proliferation, and cell cycle progression.
Although the EIF4EBPs had no effect on cell size, they inhibited cell
proliferation by selectively inhibiting the translation of mRNAs that
encode proliferation-promoting proteins and proteins involved in cell
cycle progression. Thus, Dowling et al. (2010) concluded that control of
cell size and cell cycle progression appear to be independent in
mammalian cells, whereas in lower eukaryotes, EIF4E binding proteins
influence both cell growth and proliferation.

MAPPING

Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, Tsukiyama-Kohara et al. (1996)
mapped the EIF4EBP2 gene to human chromosome 10q21-q22. They noted that
chromosomal alterations in this region have been found in some human
cancers. Tsukiyama-Kohara et al. (1996) mapped the mouse 4EBP2 gene to
chromosome 10B4-B5.

ANIMAL MODEL

Gkogkas et al. (2013) demonstrated that knockout of EIF4EBP2, (an EIF4E
(133440) repressor downstream of MTOR), or EIF4E overexpression leads to
increased translation of neuroligins, which are postsynaptic proteins
that are causally linked to autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Mice with
knockout of Eif4ebp2 exhibit an increased ratio of excitatory to
inhibitory synaptic inputs and autistic-like behaviors (i.e., social
interaction deficits, altered communication, and repetitive/stereotyped
behaviors). Pharmacologic inhibition of Eif4e activity or normalization
of neuroligin-1 (600568), but not neuroligin-2 (606479), protein levels
restored the normal excitation/inhibition ratio and rectified the social
behavior deficits. Thus, Gkogkas et al. (2013) concluded that
translational control by EIF4E regulates the synthesis of neuroligins,
maintaining the excitation-to-inhibition balance, and its dysregulation
engenders ASD-like phenotypes.

614259	TITLE *614259 WD REPEAT-CONTAINING PROTEIN 65; WDR65
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database analysis and PCR of human and mouse testis cDNA libraries,
Rorick et al. (2011) cloned 2 splice variants of human and mouse WDR65.
The deduced full-length human protein contains 1,283 amino acids and has
2 WD repeat domains. The shorter human variant encodes a deduced
698-amino acid protein that is truncated after the 2 WD repeat domains.
PCR analysis of mouse tissues revealed highest Wdr65 expression in lung,
testis, and skin. Weaker expression was detected in brain and kidney,
and no expression was detected in heart, liver, skeletal muscle, and
spleen. Wdr65 was expressed in mouse embryonic stem cells and in whole
mouse embryos beginning at about 15 days postcoitum. In situ
hybridization revealed Wdr65 expression in mouse nasal epithelium and
medial edge epithelium at 14.5 days postcoitum, and in nasal respiratory
epithelium and epidermis, but not oral epithelium, at 15.5 days
postcoitum. The increase in Wdr65 expression in these embryonic mouse
craniofacial tissues correlated with development and dissolution of the
epithelial seam.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rorick et al. (2011) determined that the WDR65 gene contains 24 exons.

MAPPING

Rorick et al. (2011) reported that the WDR65 gene maps to chromosome
1p34.2. The mouse Wdr65 gene maps to a region of chromosome 4 that
shares homology of synteny with human chromosome 1p36-p32.

GENE FUNCTION

Using microarray analysis, Rorick et al. (2011) showed that expression
of Wdr65 was significantly downregulated in Irf6 (607199)-deficient
mouse embryos compared with wildtype embryos. Database analysis revealed
an IRF6-binding site for WDR65 in an exon of the EBNA1BP2 gene (614443),
which is located 63 bp upstream of WDR65 on the opposite strand.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a Brazilian patient with van der Woude syndrome (606713), Rorick et
al. (2011) identified heterozygosity for a possibly causative missense
mutation at a conserved residue in the WDR65 gene (614259.0001).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RECLASSIFIED - VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
WDR65, ASP523TYR

This variant, formerly titled VAN DER WOUDE SYNDROME 2 (606713), has
been reclassified because its contribution to the phenotype has not been
confirmed.

In a Brazilian patient with van der Woude syndrome-2, Rorick et al.
(2011) identified a heterozygous 1567G-T transversion in exon 10 of the
WDR65 gene, resulting in an asp523-to-tyr (D523Y) substitution at a
conserved residue. Because the mutation was not found in controls and
significantly changes the biochemical properties of a conserved residue,
Rorick et al. (2011) concluded that it was potentially etiologic.

608879	TITLE *608879 VACUOLAR PROTEIN SORTING 13, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF, C; VPS13C
;;KIAA1421
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned VPS13C, which they designated
KIAA1421. The deduced protein contains 1,463 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected VPS13C expression in all adult and fetal tissues and all
specific brain regions examined. Expression was intermediate in most
tissues, but it was lower in adult pancreas and lung and in fetal liver
and brain.

By searching databases for sequences similar to VPS13A (605978),
followed by RT-PCR of lymphoid cell line and brain RNA, Velayos-Baeza et
al. (2004) cloned VPS13C. They identified 2 main splice variants,
variant 1A and variant 2A, as well as 4 different 3-prime end splice
variants. Variant 1A encodes a deduced 3,710-amino acid protein, and
variant 2A encodes a deduced 3,753-amino acid protein. VPS13C shares
significant similarity with yeast Vps13 and other human VPS13 proteins,
mostly in the N and C termini. Northern blot analysis detected
expression of variant 1A in all tissues tested, whereas variant 2A was
expressed only in brain, although at a higher level than variant 1A.

GENE STRUCTURE

Velayos-Baeza et al. (2004) determined that the VPS13C gene contains 86
exons, including 1 alternative exon (exon 81b), and spans 208 kb.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the VPS13C
gene to chromosome 15. By genomic sequence analysis, Velayos-Baeza et
al. (2004) mapped the VPS13C gene to chromosome 15q21.3. They mapped the
mouse Vps13c gene to chromosome 9C.
