;;HUMAN ENHANCER OF INVASION 10; HEI10;;
CHROMOSOME 14 OPEN READING FRAME 18; C14ORF18
HEI10/HMGIC FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

HEI10 is a member of the E3 ubiquitin ligase family and functions in
progression of the cell cycle through G(2)/M.

CLONING

By screening a HeLa cell cDNA library for enhancement of invasive
filamentous growth of yeast, Toby et al. (2003) identified a partial
cDNA for HEI10 (human enhancer of invasion-10). By database mining, they
assembled a full-length cDNA, which encodes a deduced 277-amino acid
protein with a predicted molecular mass of 32 kD. The protein contains a
divergent RING finger motif in the N terminus, a coiled-coil domain, and
cyclin and cyclin-dependent kinase phosphorylation sites in the C
terminus. Northern blot analysis identified a 1.6-kb HEI10 transcript
that was expressed at high levels in heart, moderate levels in kidney
and liver, and low levels in placenta, brain, and lung. Toby et al.
(2003) noted that the 87% sequence identity shared by the human and
mouse HEI10 orthologs is slightly higher than the average identified by
Makatowski et al. (1996).

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Toby et al. (2003) demonstrated the
interaction of HEI10 with cyclin B1 (123836) and the E2
ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcH7 (603721). Deletion constructs showed
that the RING finger domain is required for induction of filamentous
growth. Immunofluorescence analysis of human cell lines using an HEI10
antibody showed nuclear localization of HEI10, with strong expression
during cellular growth and chromosomal association during mitosis. HEI10
expression in Xenopus oocytes showed that HEI10 acts as an E3 ubiquitin
ligase, causing delayed entry into mitosis by reducing cyclin B levels.
In vitro, the cyclin B-cdc2 complex phosphorylated HEI10 primarily at
the NTPVR cell cycle kinase consensus site.

GENE STRUCTURE

Toby et al. (2003) determined that the HEI10 gene contains 3 exons.

MAPPING

Band 12q15 is often rearranged in benign mesenchymal tumors such as
uterine leiomyomas (150699), and the HMGIC gene (600698) is present in
that region. Mine et al. (2001) identified HEI10 as a fusion partner
with HMGIC in a uterine leiomyoma. Radiation hybrid mapping demonstrated
that the normal location of HEI10 is 14q11. In the fusion transcript,
the first 2 exons of the HMGIC gene, which encode DNA-binding domains,
were fused in the 3-prime portion of the HEI10 gene.

By genomic sequence analysis, Toby et al. (2003) mapped the HEI10 gene
to chromosome 14q11.1.

612662	TITLE *612662 TBC1 DOMAIN FAMILY, MEMBER 15; TBC1D15
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of a mouse adipocyte cDNA library using the
cytoplasmic domain of VAMP2 (185881) as bait, followed by sequencing
murine EST clones and database analysis, Zhang et al. (2005) cloned
mouse Tbc1d15 and identified human TBC1D15. The deduced 691-amino acid
human protein shares 88% amino acid identity with its mouse homolog, and
both proteins contain the TBC domain (see 609850). TBC1D15 shares 46%
identity with TBC1D17. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues detected
2 variants in most tissues examined, with highest expression in heart,
liver, and testis and lower expression in brain, spleen, lung, kidney,
and skeletal muscle. Immunofluorescence studies showed a diffuse
intracellular distribution of Tbc1d15 in transfected COS-1 cells,
suggesting primarily cytosolic localization.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhang et al. (2005) used baculovirus-expressed protein to demonstrate
that Tbc1d15 has Rab-GAP activity. Tbc1d15 increased Rab7 (602298)
GTPase activity and showed a lower rate of increase in activity for
Rab11 (see RAB11A; 605570), but was largely inactive against Rab4
(179511) and Rab6 (RAB6A; 179513).

602856	TITLE *602856 REGULATOR OF G PROTEIN SIGNALING 10; RGS10
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

RGS proteins negatively regulate signaling pathways involving
7-transmembrane receptors and heterotrimeric G proteins. See 602189 for
background.

CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid system with a mutationally activated form of rat
G-alpha(i3) as the bait, Hunt et al. (1996) isolated HeLa cell cDNAs
encoding RGS10. Like all members of the RGS family, the predicted
173-amino acid RGS10 contains a 120-amino acid core domain that is
strongly conserved with the yeast Sst2 protein. Northern blot analysis
detected an approximately 900-bp RGS10 transcript in HeLa cells, human
embryonic kidney 293 cells, and mouse brain.

By microarray analysis, Yang and Li (2007) found that RGS10 was highly
expressed in human osteoclastoma. Northern blot analysis confirmed high
RGS10 expression in osteoclastoma and detected weaker expression in
brain, liver, kidney, and the Hep2 cell line; no expression was detected
in other tissues and cell lines examined. Mouse Rgs10 was highly
expressed in preosteoclasts and osteoclasts derived from RANKL (TNFSF11;
602642)-stimulated bone marrow-derived monocytes, but it was not
expressed in osteoblasts or preosteoblasts.

GENE FUNCTION

Using coimmunoprecipitation studies, Hunt et al. (1996) demonstrated
that RGS10 associates specifically with the activated forms of the 2
related G protein subunits G-alpha(i3) and G-alpha(z) but fails to
interact with the structurally and functionally distinct G-alpha(s)
subunit. In vitro assays indicated that RGS10 potently and selectively
increases the GTP hydrolytic activity of several G-alpha(i) family
members.

Using human T cells silenced for or overexpressing RGS10, Garcia-Bernal
et al. (2011) showed that RGS10 inhibited G-alpha-dependent,
chemokine-upregulated T-cell adhesion mediated by alpha-4 (ITGA4;
192975)/beta-1 (ITGB1; 135630) and alpha-L (ITGAL; 153370)/beta-2
(ITGB2; 600065) integrins. The data suggested that RGS10 opposes
activation by chemokines of the VAV1 (164875)-RAC1 (602048) pathway in T
cells, leading to repression of adhesion strengthening mediated by
alpha-4/beta-1. RGS10 also limited adhesion-independent cell chemotaxis
and activation of CDC42 (116952).

GENE STRUCTURE

Sierra et al. (2002) determined that the RGS10 gene contains 5 exons and
spans 35 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Sierra et al. (2002) mapped the RGS10 gene
to chromosome 10q26.11. They mapped the mouse Rgs10 gene to chromosome 7
by interspecific backcross mapping.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yang and Li (2007) obtained Rgs10 -/- mice at the expected mendelian
ratio, but they were smaller and had shorter limbs than their wildtype
littermates. Growth retardation became apparent during the first or
second postnatal week. Histologically, Rgs10 -/- mice exhibited severe
osteopetrosis. Disruption of Rgs10 impaired osteoclast differentiation
due to the absence of calcium current oscillations and loss of Nfatc1
(600489) expression. Ectopic expression of Rgs10 markedly enhanced
Rankl-induced osteoclast differentiation. Rgs10 competitively bound
Ca(2+)/calmodulin (see CALM1; 114180) and phosphatidylinositol
3-phosphate in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. Yang and Li (2007) concluded
that RGS10 is a key regulator of Ca(2+) current oscillations during
osteoclast differentiation.

;;CHURCHILL; CHCH;;
CHROMOSOME 14 OPEN READING FRAME 52; C14ORF52
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a differential screen to identify early response genes in chicken
epiblast cells exposed to a Hensen node graft, Sheng et al. (2003)
cloned Chch. They obtained human and rodent CHCH by database searching
and PCR. The deduced CHCH protein in all species contains 112 amino
acids and has 2 putative C4-type zinc fingers, inspiring the gene name
Churchill by analogy to Sir Winston's famous gesture. Human CHCH shares
about 70% amino acid identity with fish and frog Chch and 96.4% identity
with rat and mouse Chch.

GENE FUNCTION

Sheng et al. (2003) found that Chch acts as a switch between the
different roles played by FGF (see 131220) in early chicken and frog
development. FGF induced Chch slowly, which then activated
Smad-interacting protein-1 (ZEB2; 605802), blocking further induction of
mesoderm markers by FGF. Chch was first expressed when cells stopped
migrating through the primitive streak, and Chch regulated cell
ingression.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the CHCH
gene to chromosome 14 (TMAP SHGC-33304).

606285	TITLE *606285 SORCS RECEPTOR 3; SORCS3
;;KIAA1059
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The VPS10 domain-containing receptors, including sortilin (SORT1;
602458) and sortilin-related receptor (SORL1; 602005), derive their name
from the yeast vacuolar protein sorting protein-10, which is involved in
sorting of carboxy-peptidase Y from the Golgi apparatus to the vacuole.
By EST database searching with mouse sequence of 2 VPS10 proteins,
SorCS1 (606283) and SorCS2 (606284) (Hermey et al., 1999; Rezgaoui et
al., 2001), Hampe et al. (2001) identified 3 novel human VPS10
domain-containing receptors. Two were orthologs of mouse SORCS1 and
SORCS2; the third was designated SORCS3. Hampe et al. (2001) noted that
all mammalian VPS10 domains carry an N-terminal signal peptide for
translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum. The greatest similarity
between the receptors is found in the C-terminal parts of the VPS10
domains, which harbor 12 cysteine residues with a characteristic spacing
conserved in all VPS10 proteins from yeast to man. SORCS1 and SORCS3
share the greatest homology. SORCS2 shares the same domain composition,
but is less similar. SORT1 and SORTL1 lack the leucine-rich domain of
the SORCS proteins, and their VPS10 domains are less related.

Kikuno et al. (1999) cloned a human SORCS3 cDNA, which they designated
KIAA1059, from a brain cDNA library and found that it encodes a deduced
1,297-amino acid protein.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Kikuno et al. (1999) mapped the SORCS3
gene to chromosome 10. By electronic PCR, Hampe et al. (2001) mapped the
gene within a BAC clone on chromosome 10q23.3.

606273	TITLE *606273 EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 2B, SUBUNIT 3; EIF2B3
;;EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 2B, GAMMA;;
EIF2B-GAMMA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The EIF2B3 gene contains a subunit of eIF2B, a heteropentameric guanine
nucleotide exchange factor necessary for the proper function of the
translation initiation factor eIF2 (see 603907). EIF2B catalyzes the
exchange of GDP for GTP (summary by Fogli et al., 2004).

CLONING

Translation of mRNA usually requires modification of the 5-prime cap,
but some viral and cellular mRNAs use a cap-independent mechanism of
ribosome binding mediated by an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES).
The 5-prime untranslated region of hepatitis C virus (HCV) is highly
conserved in all strains and folds into an IRES that binds directly to
40S ribosome subunits. Among the relatively limited number of cellular
cofactors binding to the HCV IRES/40S subunit is EIF2 (see 603907).
Using a ribozyme based selection system to identify cellular factors
involved in HCV IRES function, followed by database searches and 5-prime
RACE with ribozyme-binding sequences as primers, Kruger et al. (2000)
isolated a cDNA encoding EIF2B3, which they called EIF2B-gamma. The
deduced 452-amino acid protein is 91% identical to rat Eif2b-gamma.

Using human EST database searching and PCR, followed by screening of a
rat cDNA library, Price et al. (1996) obtained a partial cDNA encoding
human EIF2B3 and a full-length rat clone encoding Eif2b3. Northern blot
analysis revealed wide expression of an approximately 1.8-kb Eif2b3
transcript in rat tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Fogli et al. (2004) measured the guanine nucleotide exchange factor
(GEF) activity of EIF2B in transformed lymphocytes from 30 patients with
leukoencephalopathies (603896) with homozygous or compound heterozygous
mutations in EIF2B2 (606454), EIF2B3, EIF2B4 (606687), and EIF2B5
(603945) compared to 10 unaffected heterozygotes and 22 controls with no
EIF2B mutation. A significant decrease of 20 to 70% in GEF activity was
observed in all mutated cells, and the extent of the decrease correlated
with age at onset of disease. Fogli et al. (2004) suggested that a
deficiency in GEF activity underlies the encephalopathy in EIF2B-related
disease.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the EIF2B3
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP WI-14181).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter (VWM; 603896) is an
autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a chronic and progressive
course with additional episodes of rapid deterioration provoked by fever
and minor head trauma. Van der Knaap et al. (2002) demonstrated that
mutations in each of the 5 subunits of the translation initiation factor
eIF2B can cause the disorder. Two mutations were found in the EIF2B3
gene in compound heterozygous state (606273.0001, 606273.0002); 1 was
found in homozygosity (606273.0003).

In 5 of 11 unrelated Chinese patients with leukoencephalopathy with
vanishing white matter, Wu et al. (2009) identified mutations in the
EIF2B3, including 4 patients with the same mutation (I346T;
606273.0004), of whom 2 were homozygotes.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

In a 30-year-old Japanese woman, born of consanguineous parents, with
adult-onset VWM, Matsukawa et al. (2011) identified a homozygous
missense mutation in the EIF2B3 gene (L27Q; 606273.0005). In vitro
functional expression studies showed that the GDP/GTP exchange activity
of eIF2B containing mutant EIF2B3 was significantly decreased (40%
decrease) compared to wildtype, although the decrease was not as much as
observed in mutations associated with childhood-onset VWM. The findings
suggested that mutations that result in residual eIF2B activity may be
associated with a later age at disease onset.

LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY WITH VANISHING WHITE MATTER
EIF2B3, ARG225GLN

In a patient with leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter

2 mutations in the EIF2B3 gene: arg225 to gln (R225Q) and 1295delTG
(606273.0002). The R225Q substitution was caused by a G-to-A transition
in exon 6.

(603896), van der Knaap et al. (2002) found homozygosity for an
ala87-to-val (A87V) substitution in the EIF2B3 gene, which resulted from
a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 362 in exon 2.

In 4 of 11 unrelated Chinese patients with leukoencephalopathy with

transition in exon 9 of the EIF2B3 gene, resulting in an ile346-to-thr
(I346T) substitution. The mutation was not observed in 100 control
samples. Two patients were homozygous for the mutation, 1 was compound
heterozygous with another pathogenic EIF2B3 mutation, and the second
mutation could not be identified in the fourth patient.

LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY WITH VANISHING WHITE MATTER, ADULT-ONSET
EIF2B3, LEU27GLN

In a 30-year-old Japanese woman, born of consanguineous parents, with

homozygous 80T-A transversion in the EIF2B3 gene, resulting in a
leu27-to-gln (L27Q) substitution. She developed secondary amenorrhea at
age 28 years, left hemianopia at age 29, and weakness in her left leg
after a fall. In vitro functional expression studies showed that the
GDP/GTP exchange activity of eIF2B containing mutant EIF2B was
significantly decreased (40% decrease) compared to wildtype, although
the decrease was not as much as observed in mutations associated with
childhood-onset VWM. The findings suggested that mutations that result
in residual eIF2B activity may be associated with a later age at disease
onset.

605562	TITLE *605562 SECRETOGLOBIN, FAMILY 2A, MEMBER 2; SCGB2A2
;;MAMMAGLOBIN 1; MGB1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a modified differential display PCR technique, Watson and Fleming
(1994) isolated sequence fragments that were abundantly expressed in a
breast tumor relative to normal breast tissue. Using this fragment,
RT-PCR, and RACE, Watson and Fleming (1996) isolated a novel full-length
cDNA clone, which they designated mammaglobin-1 (MGB1). MGB1 encodes a
deduced 93-amino acid protein with a 19-amino acid hydrophobic peptide
signal sequence and a predicted molecular mass of 10.5-kD. The protein
shares 42% sequence identity with the rat prostatein protein (rPSC3). It
also shares high homology with rabbit and human uteroglobin (UGB;
192020) genes, including the conservation of cysteines known to play a
role in disulfide bond formation between uteroglobin subunits and a
conserved tyrosine required for progesterone binding to the uteroglobin
dimer. Watson et al. (1998) reported that the arrangement and splice
sites of the 3 exons of MGB1, UGB, and rPSC3 are well conserved,
suggesting that these genes constitute a multigene family derived from a
common ancestral sequence. The mammaglobin gene itself, however, is not
well conserved phylogenetically.

GENE FUNCTION

Because other uteroglobin gene family members are regulated by steroid
hormones, Watson et al. (1998) analyzed the MGB1 gene promoter for
steroid-responsive elements. They identified 2 imperfect elements
similar to estrogen- and androgen-response elements. Additionally, the
promoter contains a polyoma enhancer-related (PEA3, or ETV4; 600711)
motif. PEA3 is associated with activation of vimentin (193060)
transcription in mammary epithelial cells and overexpression of ERBB2
(164870) in human breast tumors. Watson et al. (1998) also identified
binding sites for the Sp family of transcription factors, an Ap-1
consensus site, and a binding site similar to the binding site of
pregnancy-specific mammary factor in the MGB1 promoter. They did not
observe any modulation of MGB1 transcription by estradiol, progesterone,
dexamethasone, or androgens.

Using Northern blot analysis and RT-PCR, Watson and Fleming (1996)
detected low level, breast-restricted expression of a 0.5-kb MGB1
transcript. They also detected MGB1 expression in several breast
carcinoma cell lines but not in primary breast myoepithelial cells,
primary breast stromal cells, an immortalized breast cell line, or an
immortalized luminal ductal breast cell line. In the cell lines
displaying the highest levels of expression, they also detected a 3-kb
transcript, which they hypothesized was unprocessed nuclear mRNA. Watson
and Fleming (1996) found that 8 of 35 primary breast carcinomas
overexpressed MGB1 relative to normal breast tissue specimens, and
Watson et al. (1998) found that 5 of 10 breast carcinoma cell lines and
13 of 21 metastatic breast tumors exhibited high levels of MGB1 mRNA.
The overexpression did not appear to correlate with histology, tumor
grade, tumor stage, or hormone receptor status. Watson and Fleming
(1996) concluded that MGB1 expression is mammary-specific and may define
a unique phenotype to a subset of breast carcinoma cell lines. Watson et
al. (1998) presented preliminary data suggesting that expression of MGB1
is not associated with lactation, but instead with mammary gland
proliferation and terminal differentiation.

GENE STRUCTURE

The human MGB1 gene comprises 3 exons (Watson et al., 1998).

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization and radiation hybrid analysis,
Watson et al. (1998) mapped the MGB1 gene to 11q12.3-q13.1. They
detected a second FISH signal on 15q23-q24, indicating a possible
homologous gene sequence. Chromosome 11q13 is frequently amplified in
breast carcinomas, but Watson et al. (1998) did not detect gene
amplification or gross rearrangements in breast tumors or cell lines.

604580	TITLE *604580 FIBULIN 5; FBLN5
;;DEVELOPMENTAL ARTERIES AND NEURAL CREST EGF-LIKE; DANCE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a cDNA probe derived from signal sequence trap screening of mouse
embryonic heart, EST database screening, and 5-prime RACE, Nakamura et
al. (1999) obtained a cDNA for fibulin-5 (FBLN5), which they called
DANCE (for developmental arteries and neural crest EGF-like). The FBLN5
cDNA encodes a deduced 448-amino acid secreted protein with a molecular
mass of 66 kD. Its amino acid sequence is 94% identical to that of the
mouse Fbln5 protein. It contains 6 calcium-binding EGF-like domains, one
of which contains an RGD motif. Northern blot analysis revealed a major
transcript of 2.6 kb that is expressed predominantly in heart, ovary,
and colon but also in kidney, pancreas, testis, lung, and placenta.
FBLN5 is not detectable in brain, liver, thymus, prostate, or peripheral
blood leukocytes. FBLN5 is prominently expressed in developing arteries;
in adult vessels, its expression is largely diminished but is reinduced
in balloon-injured vessels and atherosclerotic lesions, notably in
intimal vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells.

MAPPING

By FISH, Nakamura et al. (1999) mapped the FBLN5 gene to chromosome
14q32.1. By FISH and radiation hybrid analysis, Kowal et al. (1999)
mapped the FBLN5 gene to 14q31.

GENE FUNCTION

Nakamura et al. (1999) showed that FBLN5 promotes adhesion of
endothelial cells through interaction of integrins and the RGD motif.
The authors suggested that FBLN5 is a novel vascular ligand for integrin
receptors and may play a role in vascular development and remodeling.

Mullins et al. (2007) localized the fibulin-5 protein to Bruch membrane
and to the intercapillary pillars of the choriocapillaris in normal
human donor eyes. In eyes with age-related macular degeneration (ARMD3;
608895), they localized the protein to pathologic basal deposits beneath
the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) as well as in some small drusen.
Mullins et al. (2007) suggested that fibulin-5 may promote extracellular
deposit formation in macular degeneration.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Autosomal Recessive Cutis Laxa

Hereditary cutis laxa comprises a heterogeneous group of connective
tissue disorders characterized by loose skin and variable systemic
involvement. The phenotypic abnormalities observed in a fibulin-5
knockout mouse model by Nakamura et al. (2002) are reminiscent of human
autosomal recessive cutis laxa type I (ARCL1A; 219100). Both share cutis
laxa, lung emphysema, and arterial involvement. Loeys et al. (2002)
studied a large consanguineous Turkish family with 4 patients affected
by autosomal recessive cutis laxa type I, originally described by Van
Maldergem et al. (1988), and demonstrated the presence of a homozygous
missense mutation in the FBLN5 gene, resulting in a ser227-to-pro
(S227P; 604580.0001) substitution.

Hu et al. (2006) analyzed 2 disease-causing missense substitutions in
fibulin-5, C217R (604580.0010) and S227P, and found evidence for
misfolding, decreased secretion, and reduced interaction with elastin
and fibrillin-1, resulting in impaired elastic fiber development. These
findings supported the hypothesis that fibulin-5 is necessary for
elastic fiber formation by facilitating the deposition of elastin onto a
microfibrillar scaffold via direct molecular interactions.

Callewaert et al. (2013) analyzed the FBLN4 (604633), FBLN5, and LTBP4
(604710) genes in 12 families with type I ARCL and identified homozygous
mutations in the FLBN5 gene in 2 families (604580.0010 and 604580.0011).
Homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in LTBP4 were identified
in 9 families (see, e.g., 604710.0005-604710.0008). No mutations were
found in the FBLN4 gene, and no mutations were detected in 1 family in
which the proband had cutis laxa and bladder diverticula without obvious
emphysema. Callewaert et al. (2013) noted that the FBLN5 and LTBP4
mutations caused a very similar phenotype associated with severe
pulmonary emphysema, in the absence of vascular tortuosity or aneurysms.
Gastointestinal and genitourinary tract involvement seemed to be more
severe in patients with LTBP4 mutations.

- Autosomal Dominant Cutis Laxa

In a patient with autosomal dominant cutis laxa (ADCL2; 614434), Markova
et al. (2003) identified a 22-kb tandem duplication in the FBLN5 gene,
resulting in a 483-bp duplication (604580.0002).

- Age-Related Macular Degeneration 3

Stone et al. (2004) studied 402 patients with age-related macular
degeneration (see ARMD3, 608895) and identified 7 different mutations in
the FBLN5 gene (604580.0003-604580.0009) that were not found in any of
429 controls (p = 0.006). Each of the 7 patients had small circular
drusen, commonly referred to as basal laminar or cuticular drusen.

Lotery et al. (2006) investigated the role of fibulin-5 in ARMD using 2
European cohorts of 805 ARMD patients and 279 controls and by
determining the functional effects of the missense mutations on
expression of the FBLN5 gene. They found 2 novel sequence changes in
ARMD patients that were absent in controls and expressed these and the
other 9 previously reported FBLN5 mutations associated with ARMD and 2
associated with autosomal recessive cutis laxa. Fibulin-5 secretion was
significantly reduced (p less than 0.001) for 4 ARMD missense mutations
and 2 cutis laxa mutations. These results suggested that some missense
mutations associated with ARMD lead to decreased fibulin-5 secretion
with a possible corresponding reduction in elastinogenesis. The studies
further demonstrated that FBLN5 mutations can be associated with
different phenotypes of ARMD (not limited to the previously described
cuticular drusen type). FBLN5 ARMD can be a cause of choroidal
neovascularization in the absence of drusen.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yanagisawa et al. (2002) generated mice deficient in fibulin-5 by
targeted disruption. Homozygous mutant mice were viable and appeared
indistinguishable from wildtype littermates during the first 4 weeks
except that slight looseness of the skin was noticeable by weaning. By
approximately 50 days of age homozygous mutant mice showed lax skin,
which progressed with age. The lungs of homozygous mutant mice were
expanded and contained dilated alveoli, which were most severe in
peripheral regions. There was tortuosity and elongation of the aorta, as
well as elongation of the ductus arteriosus. The ascending aorta
proximal to the aortic arch was elongated in fibulin-5 -/- mice, causing
the brachiocephalic trunk and left common carotid artery to be
juxtaposed. Elastin staining of skin showed a marked reduction of the
elastic fiber network surrounding hair follicles. Enlargement of the
distal airspaces of the lung was evident by 2 weeks of age in homozygous
mutant mice. This phenotype progressed with age, leading to a severe
emphysematous change with the formation of peripheral bullae in adult
mice. Elastin staining showed that elastin (130160) at the tips of the
secondary septae was fragmented and that the elastic fibers associated
with the alveolar walls were short, thickened, and disrupted in
2-week-old homozygous mice when compared with wildtype littermates.
Elastin staining of the aorta showed that elastic laminae in homozygous
mutant mice were fragmented, the defect being more severe toward the
adventitia. Despite the disorganized elastic laminae, there was no
indication of aneurysms or dissections of the medial layers of aortae in
fibulin-5 -/- mice. Other organs were normal. Disruption of the elastic
laminae of vessels was evident as early as postnatal day 1, suggesting
that the defect seen in the adult aorta of homozygous mutant mice was
not the result of degradation of intact elastic laminae by activated
inflammatory cells, but rather the consequence of an underlying
developmental defect in the final organization of the elastic fibers in
fibulin-5 -/- mice. Yanagisawa et al. (2002) performed solid-phase
binding assays to assess the biochemical interaction of fibulin-5 with
other extracellular matrix proteins. Fibulin-5 bound strongly to
tropoelastin, and this binding was completely inhibited in the presence
of EDTA, suggesting that fibulin-5 may use calcium-binding EGF-like
motifs to bind to tropoelastin. Using immunogold labeling and electron
microscopy, Yanagisawa et al. (2002) demonstrated that fibulin-5 protein
is present along the surface of elastic lamina adjacent to the
endothelial cell membrane, demonstrating that fibulin-5 is a surface
component of elastic fibers in vivo.

Nakamura et al. (2002) independently generated fibulin-5 -/- mice. The
phenotypic findings were similar to those described by Yanagisawa et al.
(2002). They showed that the aorta, lung, and skin of fibulin-5 -/- mice
contained fragmented elastin without an increase of elastase activity,
indicating defective development of elastic fibers. Fibulin-5 interacts
directly with elastic fibers in vitro, and serves as a ligand for cell
surface integrins alpha-5/beta-3, alpha-5/beta-5 (see 193210), and
alpha-9/beta-1 (see 603963) through its N-terminal domain. Nakamura et
al. (2002) postulated that fibulin-5 may provide anchorage of elastic
fibers to cells, thereby acting to stabilize and organize elastic fibers
in the skin, lung, and vasculature.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CUTIS LAXA, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, TYPE IA
FBLN5, SER227PRO

Loeys et al. (2002) studied a large consanguineous Turkish family,
originally described by Van Maldergem et al. (1988), in which 4 patients
were affected by autosomal recessive cutis laxa type I (ARCL1A; 219100)
and demonstrated homozygosity for a 998T-C transition in the FBLN5 gene.
The mutation was predicted to result in a ser227-to-pro (S227P)
substitution in the fourth cbEGF-like domain of fibulin-5 protein.
Because serine is found in this position in mouse and rat fibulin-5 as
well as in human fibulin-3, substitution for this amino acid may have
important structural and functional consequences for normal
elastogenesis.

Hu et al. (2006) showed that S227P mutant fibulin-5 is synthesized and
secreted at a reduced rate compared to wildtype. The mutant also failed
to be incorporated into elastic fibers by transfected rat lung
fibroblasts. Purified recombinant S227P fibulin-5 showed reduced
affinity for tropoelastin in solid-phase binding assays as well as
impaired association with fibrillin-1 microfibrils; in addition, the
mutant protein triggered an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response,
as indicated by strong colocalization of the mutant with folding
chaperones in the ER and by increased rates of apoptosis in patient
fibroblasts. Histologic analysis of patient skin sections showed a lack
of fibulin-5 in the extracellular matrix and concomitant disorganization
of dermal elastic fibers, and electron microscopy of patient elastic
fibers showed a failure of elastin globules to fuse into a continuous
elastic fiber core.

.0002
CUTIS LAXA, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT 2
FBLN5, 483-BP DUP

Markova et al. (2003) analyzed the expression of the elastin gene and
the fibulin genes 1 through 5 in fibroblasts from 5 patients with cutis
laxa (ADCL2; 614434). One patient was found to express both normal (2.2
kb) and mutant (2.7 kb) fibulin-5 mRNA transcripts. The larger
transcript contained an internal duplication of 483 nucleotides, which
resulted in the synthesis and secretion of a mutant fibulin-5 protein
with 4 additional tandem calcium-binding epidermal growth factor-like
motifs. The mutation arose from a 22-kb tandem gene duplication,
encompassing the sequence from intron 4 to exon 9. No fibulin-5 or
elastin mutations were detected in the other 4 patients.

CUTIS LAXA, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, TYPE IA
FBLN5, CYS217ARG

In 3 affected sibs from a consanguineous Lebanese family with severe
generalized cutis laxa (ARCL1A; 219100), Callewaert et al. (2013)
identified homozygosity for a 649T-C transition in the FBLN5 gene,
resulting in a cys217-to-arg (C217R) substitution at a highly conserved
residue in the fourth calcium-binding EGF-like domain. The female
proband died of pulmonary emphysema and bronchiolitis at 11 months of
age; her 2 affected brothers had milder pulmonary emphysema. Other
features in the 3 sibs included peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis,
aortic valve stenosis and/or insufficiency, pyloric stenosis, and
inguinal hernias. Callewaert et al. (2013) noted that the C217R had
previously been identified by Claus et al. (2008) in another Lebanese
family with cutis laxa.

In a 19-month-old girl from a consanguineous Algerian family with severe
generalized cutis laxa with facial involvement (ARCL1A; 219100),
Callewaert et al. (2013) identified homozygosity for a 1171G-T
transversion in the FBLN5 gene, resulting in a glu391-to-ter (E391X)
substitution in the FBLN-specific domain. The mutation was present in
heterozygosity in the unaffected parents and an unaffected sister. The
mother had had 2 spontaneous abortions and 2 older sisters and a brother
with cutis laxa had died in infancy. The proband had a high and broad
forehead, low and broad nasal bridge, beaked nose, large dysplastic
ears, sagging cheeks, and everted lower lip. Other features included
severe emphysema, normal cardiac status by echocardiography,
photophobia, hypotonicity, and normal mental status.

600282	TITLE *600282 GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR, IONOTROPIC, KAINATE 4; GRIK4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian
central nervous system. Its physiologic action is exerted through the
activation of ligand-gated ion channels and G protein-coupled membrane
receptors. Glutamate-gated ionic channels are broadly classified into
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and non-NMDA types. Three related non-NMDA
receptor subunit gene families have been defined: the AMPA-preferring
family, e.g., GLUR1 (138248), and the 2 kainate-preferring families.
GRIK1 (138245), GRIK2 (138244), and GRIK3 (138243) constitute one of the
GRIK gene families, and KA1 and KA2 (gene symbols, GRIK4 and GRIK5
(600283), respectively) constitute the second GRIK gene family. GRIK4
and GRIK5 form functional heteromeric kainate-preferring ionic channels
with the subunits encoded by the GRIK1, GRIK2, and GRIK3 genes, but not
with those falling in the AMP-preferring family (Szpirer et al., 1994).

CLONING

The KA1 and KA2 subunits display 68% identity in their amino acid
sequence (Szpirer et al., 1994).

MAPPING

By Southern analysis of rat/mouse and human/mouse somatic cell hybrid
panels and by fluorescence in situ hybridization, Szpirer et al. (1994)
determined that the GRIK4 and GRIK5 genes are located on human 11q22.3
and human 19q13.2, respectively; on mouse chromosome 9 and mouse
chromosome 7, respectively; and on rat chromosome 8 and rat chromosome
1, respectively. (The localization of the mouse Grik4 and Grik5 genes
was established by interspecific backcross mapping.)

EVOLUTION

Human evolution is characterized by a dramatic increase in brain size
and complexity. To probe its genetic basis, Dorus et al. (2004) examined
the evolution of genes involved in diverse aspects of nervous system
biology. These genes, including GRIK4, displayed significantly higher
rates of protein evolution in primates than in rodents. This trend was
most pronounced for the subset of genes implicated in nervous system
development. Moreover, within primates, the acceleration of protein
evolution was most prominent in the lineage leading from ancestral
primates to humans. Dorus et al. (2004) concluded that the phenotypic
evolution of the human nervous system has a salient molecular correlate,
i.e., accelerated evolution of the underlying genes, particularly those
linked to nervous system development.

613221	TITLE *613221 MITOCHONDRIAL CARRIER HOMOLOG 2; MTCH2
;;MET-INDUCED MITOCHONDRIAL PROTEIN; MIMP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Yerushalmi et al. (2002) cloned mouse Mtch2, which they called Mimp, and
they identified human MIMP by database analysis. The mouse and human
MIMP proteins contain 303 amino acids and share 93% identity. Mimp has
characteristics of a mitochondrial carrier protein, including 6
transmembrane domains, weak tandem repeats, and an energy transfer
signature motif. Northern blot and RNA dot-blot analyses of mouse
tissues revealed ubiquitous expression. Expression was highest in testis
and brain and moderate in smooth muscle, thyroid, submaxillary gland,
and epididymis. MIMP was also expressed in a number of human epithelial
cell lines. Transfection of epitope-tagged Mimp followed by
immunohistochemical analysis and subcellular fractionation experiments
confirmed that Mimp is a mitochondrial protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Using differential display, Yerushalmi et al. (2002) showed that
expression of mouse Mimp was upregulated by the Met (167860)-hepatocyte
growth factor (HGF; 142409) signaling pathway. Activation of an
inducible Mimp expression vector in a mouse adenocarcinoma cell line led
to dose-dependent mitochondrial depolarization.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yerushalmi et al. (2002) determined that the MTCH2 gene has 13 exons and
spans at least 29 kb.

Willer et al. (2009) performed a metaanalysis of 15 genomewide
association studies for BMI comprising 32,387 participants and followed
up top signals in 14 additional cohorts comprising 59,082 participants.
Willer et al. (2009) identified dbSNP rs10838738 in the MTCH2 gene as
causing a per-allele change in BMI of 0.07 with an overall P value of
1.9 x 10(-11).

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Yerushalmi et al. (2002) mapped the MTCH2
gene to chromosome 11q12.1.

614000	TITLE *614000 NEUROBLASTOMA BREAKPOINT FAMILY, MEMBER 10; NBPF10
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NBPF10 is a member of the NBPF gene family, which consists of 22 genes
and pseudogenes that arose by gene duplication. NBPF genes contain
numerous low-copy repetitive elements and show high intergenic and
intragenic sequence identity in coding and noncoding regions (Vandepoele
et al., 2005).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to NBPF1 (610501),
Vandepoele et al. (2005) identified NBPF10. The deduced protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 416 kD. EST database analysis suggested
that NBPF10 is widely expressed in normal and tumor tissues.

GENE STRUCTURE

Vandepoele et al. (2005) determined that the NBPF10 gene contains 86
coding exons, most of which result from internal duplication.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis and FISH, Vandepoele et al. (2005) mapped
the NBPF10 gene to an NBPF gene cluster on chromosome 1q21.1.

601196	TITLE *601196 PR DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; PRDM2
;;RETINOBLASTOMA PROTEIN-BINDING ZINC FINGER PROTEIN RIZ; RIZ
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The PR domain is a protein-protein interaction module of about 100 amino
acids. PR domain-containing proteins, such as PRDM2, are often involved
in transcriptional regulation (Jiang and Huang, 2000).

CLONING

The RB1 protein (614041) is a target of viral oncoproteins. To explore
the hypothesis that viral proteins may be structural mimics of cellular
RB-binding proteins that normally mediate RB function, Buyse et al.
(1995) searched cDNA libraries for RB-binding proteins. They reported
the cloning of a cDNA for the zinc finger protein they called RIZ from
rat and human cells. It is a 250-kD nuclear protein containing 8 zinc
finger motifs. It contains an RB-binding motif that is related to that
of the adenovirus E1A oncoprotein; RIZ also shares an antigenic epitope
with the C terminus of E1A. It is expressed in human retinoblastoma
cells and at low levels in all other human cell lines examined. While
the function of RIZ was not clear, its structure and pattern of
expression suggested to Buyse et al. (1995) a role in transcriptional
regulation during neuronal differentiation and pathogenesis of
retinoblastoma.

Jiang and Huang (2000) reviewed the PR domain-containing protein family.
They stated that the full-length RIZ isoform, RIZ1, is a 1,719-amino
acid protein with an N-terminal PR domain, followed by an acidic region,
3 zinc fingers, a central GTPase domain, and a C-terminal region
containing a PEST sequence and 5 more zinc fingers. The acidic region
and first set of zinc fingers act as the RB-binding domain. The RIZ2
splice variant encodes a protein lacking the N-terminal PR domain.

GENE STRUCTURE

The RIZ gene contains at least 10 exons and spans more than 150 kb. The
majority of the RIZ1 transcript is encoded by exon 7. The RIZ2 splice
variant is produced by an internal GC-rich promoter located at the
intron-exon boundary of coding exon 5. (Jiang and Huang, 2000).

MAPPING

Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, Buyse et al. (1996) mapped the
RIZ gene to 1p36. To further determine the physical location, they
screened YACs from the CEPH human megaYAC library and found
hybridization to a YAC mapped to 1p36 that had been demonstrated to be
nonchimeric. Buyse et al. (1996) commented that RIZ may be a candidate
target of 1p36 alterations that commonly occur in neuroendocrine,
breast, liver, colon, and lymphoid tumors.

Mock et al. (1996) mapped the Riz gene to mouse chromosome 4.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The distal portion of chromosome 1p is one of the most commonly affected
regions in human cancer. In a study of hereditary and sporadic
colorectal cancer, Chadwick et al. (2000) identified a region of
frequent deletion at 32.2 centimorgans from 1ptel. Deletion breakpoints
clustered in the vicinity of or inside the gene RIZ. Sequence analysis
demonstrated frequent frameshift mutations of the RIZ gene. The
mutations consisted of 1- or 2-bp deletions of coding poly(A) tracts
(A)8 or (A)9, and were confined to microsatellite-unstable colorectal
tumors, being present in 9 of 24 (37.5%) primary tumors and in 6 of 11
(54.5%) cell lines; in 2 cell lines the mutation was homozygous (or
hemizygous). The mutations apparently were selected clonally in
tumorigenesis, because similar poly(A) tracts in other genes were not
affected. Of the 2 alternative products of the gene, RIZ1 contains a PR
domain implicated in tumor suppressor function and RIZ2 lacks this
motif. Chadwick et al. (2000) proposed that RIZ is a target of observed
1p alterations, with impairment of the PR domain-mediated function
through either frameshift mutation or genomic deletion.

Because alterations in the 1p36 region, where the RIZ gene is located,
had been described in malignant melanomas, Poetsch et al. (2002)
analyzed the RIZ gene in 16 typical nevi, 19 atypical nevi, 33 primary
melanoma lesions and 25 metastases, and DNA from 4 melanoma cell lines.
Frameshift mutations were found in 17% of melanoma samples and 8.6% of
nevi, but no missense mutations were found in the exons of RIZ. No LOH
of the RIZ gene and no microsatellite instability in 6 dinucleotide
markers or in the mononucleotide repeats MSH3 (600887) and MSH6 (600678)
could be demonstrated in the samples with RIZ frameshift mutations.
Although the results did not explain the high rate of deletions in 1p36
in melanoma, Poetsch et al. (2002) concluded that RIZ has a potential
role in the multistep tumor-forming process of malignant melanoma of the
skin.

Fang et al. (2001) identified a polymorphism in the RIZ gene consisting
of the presence or absence of a proline at codon 704 (P704). Grundberg
et al. (2004) performed in vitro studies comparing the abilities of RIZ1
P704 polymorphic variants (homozygous presence, P704+; absence, P704-;
heterozygosity, P704 +/-) to coactivate the ER-alpha (133430) and
examined association of the polymorphism to bone mineral density (BMD;
see 601884) in 343 Swedish women, aged 20 to 39 years. The expression
vector containing P704- RIZ1 showed an impaired response in coactivating
ER-alpha in a ligand- and dose-dependent manner compared with P704+ RIZ
(P less than 0.0001). The genotype frequencies were 19% (P704+), 32%
(P704-), and 49% (P704 +/-) and were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. BMD
at the heel was higher in the P704+ genotype group than in the P704 +/-
group (P = 0.02), which was evident also after corrections for fat and
lean mass (P = 0.03). Grundberg et al. (2004) concluded that RIZ1 may be
a candidate gene for involvement in the variation seen in BMD.

609091	TITLE *609091 F-BOX ONLY PROTEIN 9; FBXO9
;;FBX9;;
NY-REN-57
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the F-box protein family, such as FBXO9, are characterized by
an approximately 40-amino acid F-box motif. SCF complexes, formed by
SKP1 (601434), cullin (see CUL1; 603134), and F-box proteins, act as
protein-ubiquitin ligases. F-box proteins interact with SKP1 through the
F box, and they interact with ubiquitination targets through other
protein interaction domains (Jin et al., 2004).

CLONING

Using SKP1 as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen and by searching DNA
databases, Cenciarelli et al. (1999) identified several genes encoding
F-box proteins, including FBX9. The N-terminal half of FBX9 contains a
leucine zipper, followed by an F box.

Jin et al. (2004) reported that the FBXO9 protein contains an N-terminal
tetratricopeptide repeat, a central F box, and a C-terminal HNH nuclease
family domain.

MAPPING

Jin et al. (2004) stated that the FBXO9 gene maps to chromosome
6p12.3-p11.2 and the mouse Fbxo9 gene maps to chromosome 9E1.0.

165195	TITLE *165195 OPIOID RECEPTOR, DELTA-1; OPRD1
;;OPRD
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Bzdega et al. (1993) cloned the mouse Oprd1 gene from a mouse
neuroblastoma-rat glioma hybrid cell line. The clone they isolated was
apparently identical to those reported by others (e.g., Evans et al.,
1992). They found full-length transcripts of the gene in mouse brain but
in no other tissues examined. Within the brain the gene was expressed at
low levels in many regions, but transcripts were found in particularly
large amounts in the anterior pituitary and pineal glands. Since these
tissues are located outside the blood-brain barrier, opioid peptides
easily can reach receptors in these areas from the blood.

By RT-PCR screening of melanoma cell lines for the presence of
delta-opioid receptor mRNA, Mayer et al. (2000) detected a 623-bp
product in addition to the expected 773-bp product. Ligand binding
studies confirmed the presence of the delta-opioid receptors on pigment
cells at the expected binding capacity but at somewhat lower density
than expected. Further RT-PCR screening determined that the normal
receptor is present on all normal and malignant pigment and neuronal
cells, whereas the short form is found exclusively in the tumors.
Sequence analysis indicated that the short receptor is not encoded by
the genome but results from mRNA processing and a deletion, apparently
by a transposon mechanism, of 144 bp within the third exon. This region
corresponds to the third cytoplasmic domain of the receptor molecule.

GENE STRUCTURE

Mayer et al. (2000) noted that the OPRD1 gene contains 3 exons.

MAPPING

Bzdega et al. (1993) mapped the mouse Oprd1 gene, which they called Nbor
for 'neuroblastoma opiate receptor,' to the distal region of mouse
chromosome 4 by linkage studies. It was found to lie between Lck and
Gnb-1. The human homologs of these 2 genes, LCK (153390) and GNB1
(139380), are located on human chromosome 1p; thus, the human gene for
delta-opiate receptor is probably in this region. (GNB1 is mapped to
1pter-p31.2; LCK is mapped to 1p35-p32.)

Kaufman et al. (1994) reported linkage relationships of Oprd1 on mouse
chromosome 4 and stated that the human homolog had been mapped to 1p by
in situ hybridization.

Befort et al. (1994) assigned the OPRD1 gene to chromosome 1p36.1-p34.3
by isotopic in situ hybridization and the homologous gene to mouse
chromosome 4 by the same method.

GENE FUNCTION

Jordan and Devi (1999) provided biochemical and pharmacologic evidence
for the heterodimerization of 2 fully functional opioid receptors, kappa
(OPRK1; 165196) and delta. This results in a new receptor that exhibits
ligand binding and functional properties that are distinct from those of
either receptor. Furthermore, the kappa-delta heterodimer
synergistically binds highly selective agonists and potentiates signal
transduction.

Whistler et al. (2002) identified a G protein-coupled
receptor-associated sorting protein, GASP (300417), that interacts with
the cytoplasmic tail of OPRD1 and appears to modulate OPRD1 recycling
and trafficking to lysosomes. Opioid peptide activation of HEK293 cells
transfected with GASP resulted in rapid endocytosis and proteolysis of
OPRD1. Using several binding assays with truncated GASP proteins,
Whistler et al. (2002) determined that the C-terminal portion of GASP
binds specifically to the OPRD1 tail.

Agirregoitia et al. (2006) studied the expression and localization of
delta (OPRD1), kappa (OPRK1), and mu (OPRM1; 600018) opioid receptors on
human spermatozoa and the implication in sperm motility. These receptors
are located in different parts of the head, in the middle region, and in
the tail of the sperm. Progressive motility of spermatozoa, an important
parameter to evaluate male fertility, was significantly reduced after
incubation with the mu receptor agonist morphine, whereas this effect
was antagonized in the presence of the corresponding antagonist
naloxone. The delta receptor antagonist naltrindole significantly
reduced progressive motility immediately after its addition. However,
the delta receptor agonist DPDPE had no significant effect. Finally,
neither the kappa receptor agonist U50488 nor its antagonist
norbinaltorphimine significantly affected the progressive motility of
human spermatozoa.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Pharmacologic and electrophysiologic evidence indicates that opioid
receptors are involved in the mechanism of heroin dependence. Thus,
opioid receptors are appropriate candidate genes for case-control
association studies of heroin dependence. To test the hypothesis that
OPRD1 or a closely linked gene is associated with heroin dependence, Xu
et al. (2002) used 5-prime nuclease assays to genotype 2 OPRD1 SNPs in
450 Chinese heroin dependent patients and 304 unaffected controls from
the same population. In addition, 5 SNPs distributed in 4 other genes
(ADH1B, 103720; ALDH2, 100650; OPRM1, 600018; and DRD1, 126449) were
used as genomic control loci to test the case and control populations
for stratification bias. One of the SNPs, 80G, was absent from both
Chinese opioid dependence patients and controls; genotype and allele
frequencies at the other OPRD1 SNP, 921T-C, were not significantly
different.

Zhang et al. (2008) genotyped 11 SNPs in the OPRD1 gene in spanning
OPRD1 were examined in 1,063 European Americans, including 620 with
substance dependence, 557 with alcohol dependence (103780), 225 with
cocaine dependence, 111 with opioid dependence (610064), and 443
controls. Although individual SNPs in general did not show significant
associations after multiple corrections, haplotype analyses showed that
a 6-SNP haplotype, which harbors the G allele of 80G-T (dbSNP rs1042114)
and the C allele of 921C-T (dbSNP rs2234918), was significantly
associated with alcohol dependence (p = 0.002) and opioid dependence (p
less than 0.001). This haplotype yielded odds ratios of 6.43 for alcohol
dependence and 50.57 for opioid dependence.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Granier et al. (2012) reported the crystal structure of the mouse
delta-opioid receptor bound to the subtype-selective antagonist
naltrindole. Together with the structures of the mu-opioid receptor and
kappa-opioid receptor, the delta-opioid receptor structure provided
insights into conserved elements of opioid ligand recognition while also
revealing structural features associated with ligand subtype
selectivity. The binding pocket of opioid receptors can be divided into
2 distinct regions. Whereas the lower part of this pocket is highly
conserved among opioid receptors, the upper part contains divergent
residues that confer subtype selectivity. This provides a structural
explanation and validation for the 'message-address' model of opioid
receptor pharmacology, in which distinct 'message' (efficacy) and
'address' (selectivity) determinants are contained within a single
ligand. Comparison of the address region of the delta-opioid receptor
with other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) revealed that this
structural organization may be a more general phenomenon, extending to
other GPCR families as well.

ANIMAL MODEL

Filliol et al. (2000) generated Oprd1-deficient mice and compared the
behavioral responses of mice lacking Oprd1, Oprm, and Oprk1 in several
models of anxiety and depression. Their data showed no detectable
phenotype in Oprk1 -/- mutants, suggesting that kappa-receptors do not
have a role in this aspect of opioid function. Opposing phenotypes in
Oprm -/- and Oprd1 -/- mutants contrasted with the classic notion of
similar activities of mu- and delta-receptors. Anxiogenic- and
depressive-like responses in Oprd1 -/- mice indicated that
delta-receptor activity contributes to improvement of mood states.
Filliol et al. (2000) concluded that the Oprd1-encoded receptor, which
has been proposed to be a promising target for the clinical management
of pain, should also be considered in the treatment of drug addiction
and other mood-related disorders.

102600	TITLE *102600 ADENINE PHOSPHORIBOSYLTRANSFERASE; APRT
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The APRT gene encodes adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.7), an
enzyme that catalyzes the formation of AMP from adenine and
phosphoribosylpyrophosphate. APRT acts as a salvage enzyme for the
recycling of adenine into nucleic acids (summary by Broderick et al.,
1987).

CLONING

Wilson et al. (1986) determined the amino acid sequence of the APRT
protein. The enzyme has 179 residues with a calculated molecular weight
of 19.5 kD.

Broderick et al. (1987) determined the nucleotide sequence of the human
APRT gene. The APRT gene encodes a 180-amino acid protein (Tischfield
and Ruddle, 1974). Comparative analysis by Broderick et al. (1987)
showed that the amino acid sequence is highly conserved: the human
protein was 82% and 90% identical to the mouse and hamster sequences,
respectively. The gene is constitutively expressed and subject to
little, if any, regulation.

Hidaka et al. (1987) prepared a complete sequence of the APRT gene and
found a number of discrepancies from the sequence reported by Broderick
et al. (1987), all occurring within noncoding regions.

GENE STRUCTURE

Broderick et al. (1987) determined that the APRT gene is about 2.6 kb
long and contains 5 exons. The promoter region of the human APRT gene,
like that of several other housekeeping genes, lacks the 'TATA' and
'CCAAT' boxes but contains 5 GC boxes that are potential binding sites
for the Sp1 transcription factor. Broderick et al. (1987) found that CpG
dinucleotides in the APRT gene in species as widely separated in
evolution as man, mouse, hamster, and E. coli were conserved at a
frequency higher than expected on the basis of randomness considering
the G+C content of the gene. This suggested some importance of this
sequence to the function of the gene. Although the intron 1 sequences of
mouse and man had no apparent homology, both had retained a very high
CpG content.

MAPPING

By cell hybridization studies, Tischfield and Ruddle (1974) concluded
that the APRT locus is on chromosome 16. Marimo and Giannelli (1975)
confirmed this assignment by demonstrating a 1.69-fold increase in
enzyme level in trisomy 16 cells. The same cells showed no difference in
the levels of HGPRT (308000), G6PD (305900) or adenosine kinase (102750)
from controls.

Barg et al. (1982) assigned APRT to chromosome 16pter-q12. Lavinha et
al. (1984) assigned APRT and DIA4 (125860) to 16q12-q22 by study of
rearranged chromosomes 16 in somatic cell hybrids. For APRT,
Ferguson-Smith and Cox (1984) found a smallest region of overlap (SRO)
of 16q22.2-q22.3.

Fratini et al. (1986) mapped the APRT locus with respect to the HP
(140100) locus and the fragile site at 16q23.2 (FRA16D). A subclone of
the APRT gene and a cDNA clone of HP were used for molecular
hybridization to DNA from mouse-human hybrid cell lines containing
specific chromosome 16 translocations. The APRT subclone was used for in
situ hybridization to chromosomes expressing FRA16D. APRT was found to
be distal to HP and FRA16D and was localized at 16q24, making the gene
order cen--FRA16B--HP--FRA16D--APRT--qter.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Mutant forms of adenine phosphoribosyltransferase resulting in enzyme
deficiency (APRTD; 614723) were described by Kelley et al. (1968) and by
Henderson et al. (1969), who found the inheritance to be autosomal. A
heat-stable enzyme allele had a frequency of about 15% and the
heat-labile enzyme allele a frequency of about 85%. Kelley et al. (1968)
found apparent heterozygosity in 4 persons in 3 generations of a family.
However, the level of enzyme activity ranged from 21 to 37%, not 50%.

In a lymphoblastoid cell line from a Caucasian patient in Belgium with
complete APRT deficiency (614723), Hidaka et al. (1987) identified
compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the APRT gene (102600.0001
and 102600.0002). Gathof et al. (1991) identified homozygosity for an
APRT mutation (102600.0002) in identical twin brothers born to
nonconsanguineous German parents with APRT deficiency. In 5 patients
from Iceland with complete APRT deficiency, Chen et al. (1990)
identified a homozygous mutation in the APRT gene (D65V; 102600.0004).

In Japanese, partial deficiency of APRT leads to 2,8-dihydroxyadenine
urolithiasis (type II), whereas all Caucasian patients with 2,8-DHA
urolithiasis have been completely deficient (type I). Fujimori et al.
(1985) found that partially purified enzyme from Japanese families has a
reduced affinity for phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP), as well as
increased resistance to heat and reduced sensitivity to the stabilizing
effect of PRPP. They referred to this common Japanese mutant allele as
APRT*J. In Japanese patients with APRT deficiency, Hidaka et al. (1988)
identified the molecular basis for the APRT*J allele: an M136T
(102600.0003) substitution in the putative PRPP-binding site. The mutant
enzyme showed abnormal kinetics and activity that was less than 10.3% of
normal. By a specific cleavage method using cyanogen bromide (BrCN) to
identify the M136T allele, Kamatani et al. (1989) found that 79% of all
Japanese patients with APRT deficiency and more than half of the world's
patients have this particular mutation.

Hakoda et al. (1990) made the interesting observation that 2-step
mutations leading to homozygous deficiencies at the somatic cell level,
as proposed by the Knudson hypothesis of carcinogenesis in
retinoblastoma (180200) and some other human tumors, occur at other
autosomal loci. They cloned and enumerated somatic T cells with
mutations at the APRT locus by taking advantage of the presence of
heterozygous APRT deficiency and an effective selection procedure for
homozygosity. They cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells with
2,6-diaminopurine, an APRT-dependent cytotoxin, to search for in vivo
mutational cells. In all 4 heterozygotes studied, homozygously deficient
T cells were found, at an average frequency of 1.3 x 10(-4). Among 310
normal persons, Hakoda et al. (1990) identified only 1 homozygous
APRT-deficient clone, with a calculated frequency of 5.0 x 10(-9).
Homozygous cells were found at rather high frequencies in 15 putative
heterozygotes, as reported by Hakoda et al. (1991). Analysis of genomic
DNA in 82 resistant clones from 2 of the heterozygotes showed that 64
(78%) had lost the germinally intact alleles. This approach may prove
useful for identifying heterozygotes for other enzyme deficiencies.

CYTOGENETICS

Wang et al. (1999) described a Czech patient with Morquio syndrome
(253000) who also had deficiency of APRT leading to 2,8-dihydroxyadenine
urolithiasis. They pointed out that both GALNS (612222) and APRT are
located on 16q24.3, suggesting that the patient had a deletion involving
both genes. PCR amplification of genomic DNA indicated that a novel
junction was created by the fusion of sequences distal to GALNS exon 2
and proximal to APRT exon 3, and that the size of the deleted region was
approximately 100 kb. The deletion breakpoints were localized within
GALNS intron 2 and APRT intron 2. Several other genes, including CYBA
(608508), which is deleted or mutated in an autosomal form of chronic
granulomatous disease (233690), are located in the 16q24.3 region.
However, PCR amplification showed that the CYBA gene was present in the
proband. Fukuda et al. (1996) described a Japanese patient with a
submicroscopic deletion involving GALNS and APRT in one chromosome and a
point mutation (R386C; 253000.0003) in the other GALNS allele. Wang et
al. (1999) concluded that these findings indicated that APRT is located
telomeric to GALNS, that GALNS and APRT are transcribed in the same
orientation (centromeric to telomeric), and that combined APRT/GALNS
deficiency may be more common than hitherto realized.

ANIMAL MODEL

Engle et al. (1996) used targeted homologous recombination in embryonic
stem cells to produce mice that lack APRT. Mice homozygous for a null
Aprt allele excreted adenine and DHA crystals in their urine. Renal
histopathology showed extensive tubular dilation, inflammation,
necrosis, and fibrosis that varied in severity between different mouse
backgrounds.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
APRT DEFICIENCY
APRT, 3-BP DEL, 2179TTC

In a lymphoblastoid cell line from a Caucasian patient in Belgium with
complete APRT deficiency (614723), Hidaka et al. (1987) identified
compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the APRT gene: a 3-bp
deletion (2179delTTC) in exon 4, resulting in the deletion of codon
phe173, and a 1-bp insertion (1834insT) immediately adjacent to the
splice site at the 5-prime end of intron 4 (102600.0002). This insertion
led to aberrant splicing, the absence of exon 4, frameshift, and
premature termination at amino acid 110. The enzyme activity was less
than 1% of normal and the enzyme protein was immunologically
undetectable.

.0002
APRT DEFICIENCY
APRT, 1-BP INS, 1834T

See 102600.0001 and Hidaka et al. (1987).

In identical twin brothers born to nonconsanguineous German parents with
APRT deficiency (614723), Gathof et al. (1991) identified a homozygous
1-bp insertion in the splice donor site of intron 4 of the APRT gene
(the numbering system used by Gathof et al. (1991) indicated that the
insertion was between bases 1831 and 1832 or 1832 and 1833). The
insertion resulted in aberrant splicing. They quoted finding of the same
mutation in 2 other Caucasian patients living in the U.S., and as one of
2 alleles in a Belgian patient with compound heterozygous APRT mutations
(Hidaka et al., 1987).

Menardi et al. (1997) demonstrated homozygosity for this common T
insertion at the exon 4/intron 4 junction, resulting in the lack of exon
4 in the APRT mRNA. This common splice site mutation had always been
found in association with a TaqI RFLP, leading to the proposal that this
splice site mutation originated from a single event (Chen et al., 1993).
However, Menardi et al. (1997) found a patient with this mutation who
was negative for the TaqI RFLP. The position of this T insertion
suggested it was a hotspot for mutational events (Chen et al., 1993).

.0003
APRT DEFICIENCY, JAPANESE TYPE
APRT, MET136THR

This mutation has been designated APRT*J.

In Japanese patients with APRT deficiency (614723), Hidaka et al. (1988)
identified a 2069T-C transition in exon 5 of the APRT gene, resulting in
a met136-to-thr (M136T) substitution in the putative PRPP-binding site.
The mutant enzyme showed abnormal kinetics and activity that was less
than 10.3% of normal.

By a specific cleavage method using cyanogen bromide (BrCN) to identify
the M136T allele, Kamatani et al. (1989) found that 79% of all Japanese
patients with APRT deficiency and more than half of the world's patients
have this particular mutation.

Kamatani et al. (1990) found that 24 of 39 Japanese patients with
2,8-dihydroxyadenine urolithiasis had only APRT*J alleles. They found
that normal alleles occur in 4 major haplotypes, whereas all APRT*J
alleles occurred in only 2. They interpreted this as meaning that all
APRT*J alleles had a single origin and that this mutant sequence has
been maintained for a long time, as reflected in the frequency of the
recombinant alleles.

Sahota et al. (1991) described DHA-lithiasis in a Japanese patient with
APRT deficiency who was heterozygous for the M136T mutation. Enzyme
studies showed decreased overall activity, with decreased affinity for
PRPP. Lithiasis had previously only been observed in homozygotes. The
polyamine pathway is thought to be the major source of endogenous
adenine in man. Whether increased polyamine synthesis could lead to
increased adenine production and predispose to DHA-lithiasis in an APRT
heterozygote, remained to be determined.

Among 141 defective APRT alleles from 72 different Japanese families,
Kamatani et al. (1992) found the met136-to-thr mutation in 96 (68%).
Thirty (21%) and 10 (7%) alleles had the TGG-to-TGA nonsense mutation at
codon 98 (102600.0005) and duplication of a 4-bp sequence in exon 3
(102600.0006), respectively.

Kamatani et al. (1996) noted that the APRT*J mutation is distributed
nearly uniformly on the 4 main islands of Japan and Okinawa, suggesting
a very early origin. Among 955 random Japanese blood samples, 7 (0.73%)
were heterozygous for the APRT*J mutation. None of 231 Taiwanese samples
contained heterozygotes for this mutation, whereas 2 (0.53%) of 356
Korean samples were heterozygous. Since the APRT*J mutation was found in
Koreans and Okinawans who shared ancestors only before the Yayoi era
(3rd century B.C. to 3rd century A.D.), the origin of the APRT*J
mutation predates 300 B.C.

.0004
APRT DEFICIENCY
APRT, ASP65VAL

In 5 patients from Iceland with complete APRT deficiency (614723), Chen
et al. (1990) identified a homozygous 1350A-T transversion in exon 3 of
the APRT gene, resulting in an asp65-to-val (D65V) substitution. Common
ancestry could only be identified for 2 of the cases.

.0005
APRT DEFICIENCY
APRT, TRP98TER

In 4 unrelated Japanese individuals with complete APRT deficiency
(614723), Mimori et al. (1991) identified a 1453G-A transition in the
APRT gene, resulting in a trp98-to-ter (Y98X) substitution.

.0006
APRT DEFICIENCY
APRT, 4-BP DUP, EX3

Among 141 defective APRT alleles from 72 different Japanese families
with APRT deficiency (614723), Kamatani et al. (1992) found that 10 (7%)
had duplication of a CCGA sequence in exon 3. The duplication resulted
in an APRT*Q0 (null) allele. Two other alleles, APRT*J (102600.0003) and
trp98-to-ter (Y98X; 102600.0005), accounted for 68% and 21% mutant
alleles, respectively. The different alleles with the same mutation had
the same haplotype, except for APRT*J. Evidence for a crossover or a
gene conversion event within the APRT gene was observed in an APRT*J
mutant allele.

.0007
APRT DEFICIENCY
APRT, LEU110PRO

In 2 sisters from Newfoundland with APRT deficiency (614723), Sahota et
al. (1994) identified a homozygous mutation in the APRT gene, resulting
in a leu110-to-pro (L110P) substitution. One of the sisters exhibited
2,8-dihydroxyadenine urolithiasis, whereas the other was disease-free.

.0008
APRT DEFICIENCY
APRT, 254-BP DEL AND 8-BP INS

In a Caucasian patient with complete APRT deficiency (614723), Menardi
et al. (1997) found compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the APRT
gene: a common T insertion at the IVS4 splice donor site (102600.0002)
and a novel complex mutation involving simultaneous deletion/insertion
and repair events. The second mutation involved a deletion of 254 bp and
an insertion of 8 bp exactly at the site of the deletion. Downstream of
the mutations, Menardi et al. (1997) found a 14-bp sequence of inverse
complementary to this insertion and 6 flanking nucleotides. A more
detailed analysis of the region where the deletion had occurred revealed
several informative sequence features suitable to explain how the
mutation took place.

.0009
APRT DEFICIENCY
APRT, TER-SER

In a Japanese man with APRT deficiency (614723), Taniguchi et al. (1998)
found that the physiologic stop codon of the gene, TGA, was replaced by
TCA. This base substitution generated a new HinfI restriction site, and,
using PCR and subsequent digestion by this enzyme, they could confirm
that the patient was homozygous for the base substitution. The amount of
mRNA in transformed B cells was approximately one-quarter of that in
control subjects, and no APRT proteins were detected. In eukaryotes,
unlike prokaryotes, no rescue systems for defective polypeptide
termination caused by a missing stop codon have been found. Therefore,
the outcome of the defect in this patient was unclear from present
knowledge about termination of polypeptide synthesis. The stop codon was
changed to a serine codon and the reading frame was extended to the
poly(A) addition site. The poly(A) signal AGTAAA is located 213
nucleotides downstream of the physiologic stop codon, but there are no
stop codons between them (Broderick et al., 1987). The patient developed
pseudoarthrosis after a traumatic broken arm, and was found to have
increased serum creatinine and 2,8-dihydroxyadenine crystals in his
urine. Imaging showed a small right kidney.

602644	TITLE *602644 TETRASPANIN 4; TSPAN4
;;TRANSMEMBRANE 4 SUPERFAMILY, MEMBER 7; TM4SF7;;
TETRASPAN;;
NOVEL ANTIGEN 2; NAG2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TSPAN4 belongs to the large family of tetraspanins, so named because
they contain 4 transmembrane domains. Tetraspanins are frequently
expressed at the cell surface in association with each other and with
other molecules, such as integrins (see ITGB1; 135630), and they
function to regulate cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and
differentiation (summary by Todd et al., 1998).

CLONING

Tachibana et al. (1997) generated monoclonal antibodies against proteins
that coimmunoprecipitated with CD81 (TAPA1; 186845) from a human breast
cancer cell line. Two antibodies recognized a 28- to 35-kD protein,
which Tachibana et al. (1997) named NAG2 for 'novel antigen-2.' Using
the antibodies to screen a cDNA expression library derived from the
breast cancer cell line, the authors cloned cDNAs encoding NAG2. The
predicted 238-amino acid NAG2 protein contains 4 hydrophobic domains and
shows homology to transmembrane 4 superfamily (TM4SF) proteins. Northern
blot analysis detected a 1.5-kb NAG2 mRNA, and together with flow
cytometry and immunohistochemistry, showed that NAG2 was expressed in
multiple tissues but was absent in brain, lymphoid cells, and platelets.
Immunofluorescence analysis showed that NAG2 colocalized with CD81 on
the cell surface. Tachibana et al. (1997) identified mouse ESTs encoding
the mouse homolog of NAG2. The human and mouse NAG2 proteins have 95%
amino acid identity.

By searching an EST database for sequences containing a tetraspanin
consensus sequence, Todd et al. (1998) identified human TSPAN4. The
deduced 238-amino acid protein contains 4 transmembrane domains and
other features characteristic of tetraspanins, including conservation of
charged residues in or near the transmembrane domains, similar to ion
channels, and of 4 cysteines in the second extracellular domain.
Northern blot analysis detected highest TSPAN4 expression in heart and
placenta. EST database analysis suggested that TSPAN4 is also expressed
in brain, melanocytes, pancreas, and fetal liver/spleen, in addition to
pregnant uterus and adult and fetal heart.

GENE FUNCTION

Tachibana et al. (1997) found that NAG2 coimmunoprecipitated with
integrins and other TM4SF members, indicating that NAG2 is present in
TM4SF-TM4SF and TM4SF-integrin complexes.

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the TSPAN4 gene to chromosome 11p15.5 based on an
alignment of the TSPAN4 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF022813) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

103180	TITLE *103180 ADP-RIBOSYLATION FACTOR 1; ARF1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs), such as ARF1, are small guanine
nucleotide-binding proteins that enhance the enzymatic activities of
cholera toxin. ARFs are essential and ubiquitous in eukaryotes, being
involved in vesicular transport and functioning as activators of
phospholipase D. The functions of ARF proteins in membrane traffic and
organelle integrity are intimately tied to their reversible association
with membranes and specific interactions with membrane phospholipids. A
common feature of these functions is their regulation by the binding and
hydrolysis of GTP (summary by Bobak et al. (1989) and Amor et al.
(1994)).

CLONING

Bobak et al. (1989) cloned 2 ARF cDNAs, ARF1 and ARF3 (103190), from a
human cerebellum library. Based on deduced amino acid sequences and
patterns of hybridization of cDNA and oligonucleotide probes with
mammalian brain poly(A)+ RNA, human ARF1 is the homolog of bovine ARF1.
Human ARF3, however, appeared to represent a newly identified, third
type of ARF, which differs from bovine ARF1 and bovine ARF2. Peng et al.
(1989) also reported cloning of ADP-ribosylation factor.

Lee et al. (1992) found that human ARF1 is identical to its bovine
counterpart, has a distinctive pattern of tissue and developmental
expression, and is encoded by an mRNA of approximately 1.9 kb.

GENE FUNCTION

Coatomer, or COPI (see 601924), is a heptameric protein recruited to
membranes by ARF1. Coat assembly helps in the transport of budding off
membrane between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus.
Using fluorescence microscopy, Presley et al. (2002) showed that guanine
nucleotide exchange-activated ARF1 at the Golgi membrane recruits and
binds cytoplasmic COPI to the membranes. Photobleaching experiments
demonstrated that COPI remains at the membranes after ARF1-GTP has been
hydrolyzed by ARFGAP1 (608377). COPI binds to membrane cargo,
soluble-cargo receptors, or other Golgi proteins. Uncoating, or the
release of COPI from Golgi membranes to the cytoplasm, then occurs,
which can be inhibited by aluminum fluoride. Presley et al. (2002)
concluded from their kinetic and biochemical analyses that COPI and ARF1
continuously bind and release from Golgi membranes, allowing the
membrane at these sites to recruit cargo, alter their phospholipid
composition, and become larger, phase-separated domains.

Endocytosis of glycosylphosphatidyl inositol (GPI)-anchored proteins and
the fluid phase takes place primarily through a dynamin (see DNM1;
602377)- and clathrin (see CLTC; 118955)-independent, CDC42
(116952)-regulated pinocytic mechanism. In Chinese hamster ovary cells,
Kumari and Mayor (2008) found that reduced activity or levels of Arf1
inhibited GPI-anchored protein and fluid-phase endocytosis without
affecting other clathrin-dependent or -independent endocytic pathways.
Arf1 was activated at distinct sites on the plasma membrane, and it
recruited the CDC42 GTPase-activating protein Arhgap10 (609746) to the
plasma membrane, thereby modulating cell surface Cdc42 dynamics. Kumari
and Mayor (2008) concluded that ARF1 regulates both endocytosis and
secretion and may provide a mechanism for crosstalk between these
processes.

Using a yeast genetic screen for substrates of the Shigella flexneri
type III effector protein IpaJ, Burnaevskiy et al. (2013) identified
Arf1 and Arf2 (ARF4; 601177). Mass spectrometric analysis showed that
IpaJ cleaved the peptide bond between myristoylated gly2 and asn3 of
human ARF1. Further analysis showed that IpaJ cleaved numerous
N-myristoylated proteins with various functions. Burnaevskiy et al.
(2013) concluded that IpaJ is a cysteine protease that cleaves the
N-myrisoylated glycine from ARF1, possibly as the substrate cycles
between activity-dependent conformational states. They proposed that
cleavage of lipidated proteins may be a mechanism of microbial
pathogenesis.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Amor et al. (1994) described the 3-dimensional structure of full-length
human ARF1 in its GDP-bound nonmyristoylated form.

Mossessova et al. (1998) reported the crystal structure of the catalytic
Sec7 homology domain of ARNO (602488), a human guanine nucleotide
exchange factor (GEF) for ARF1, determined at 2.2-angstrom resolution.
The Sec7 domain is an elongated, all-helical protein with a distinctive
hydrophobic groove that is phylogenetically conserved. Structure-based
mutagenesis identifies the groove and an adjacent conserved loop as the
ARF-interacting surface. The sites of Sec7 domain interaction on ARF1
have subsequently been mapped, by protein footprinting experiments, to
the switch 1 and switch 2 GTPase regions, leading to a model for the
interaction between ARF GTPases and Sec7 domain exchange factors.

Nucleotide dissociation from small G protein-GEF complexes involves
transient GDP-bound intermediates. In the case of ARF proteins, small G
proteins that regulate membrane traffic in eukaryotic cells, such
intermediates can be trapped either by the natural inhibitor brefeldin A
or by charge reversal at the catalytic glutamate of the Sec7 domain of
their GEFs. Renault et al. (2003) reported the crystal structure of
these intermediates, which shows that membrane recruitment of ARF and
nucleotide dissociation are separate reactions stimulated by the Sec7
domain. The reactions proceed through sequential rotations of the
Arf-GDP core towards the Sec7 catalytic site, and are blocked by
interfacial binding of brefeldin A and unproductive stabilization of GDP
by charge reversal.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lee et al. (1992) determined that the ARF1 gene has 4 introns and spans
approximately 16.5 kb. Exon 1 (46 bp) contains only untranslated
sequence. The 5-prime flanking region has a high GC content but no TATA
or CAAT box, as found in housekeeping genes. The authors stated that the
2 human class I ARF genes, ARF1 and ARF3, have similar exon/intron
organizations and use GC-rich promoters.

MAPPING

Hirai et al. (1996) obtained an expressed sequence tag related to the
ARF1 gene and used fluorescence in situ hybridization to assign ARF1 to
1q42.

138380	TITLE *138380 GLUTATHIONE S-TRANSFERASE, MU-2; GSTM2
;;GLUTATHIONE S-TRANSFERASE 4; GST4;;
GLUTATHIONE S-TRANSFERASE M2;;
GST, MUSCLE; GSTM
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The glutathione S-transferases (GST; EC 2.5.1.18) are a family of
enzymes responsible for the metabolism of a broad range of xenobiotics
and carcinogens (Mannervik, 1985). This enzyme catalyzes the reaction of
glutathione with a wide variety of organic compounds to form thioethers,
a reaction that is sometimes a first step in a detoxification process
leading to mercapturic acid formation.

Based on amino acid sequence similarities and antibody
cross-reactivities, the mammalian cytosolic GSTs are divided into
several classes, including alpha (e.g., 138359), mu (e.g., 138350),
kappa (602321), theta (e.g., 600436), pi (134660), omega (605482), and
zeta (603758). In addition, there is a class of microsomal GSTs (e.g.,
138330). Each class is encoded by a single gene or a gene family.

CLONING

In muscle extracts, Van Cong et al. (1984) observed a novel GST band
(called GST4, or GSTM2), which migrated between GST3 (GSTP1; 134660) and
GST1 (GSTM1; 138350). No polymorphism was noted. The formation of
heterodimeric bands with GSTM1 indicated that GSTM2 is a dimeric enzyme
and that it is controlled by a separate gene. GSTM1, GSTM2, and GSTM3
(138390) are class mu isoenzymes. GSTM1 encodes an enzyme expressed in
liver and peripheral blood, while the products of GSTM2 and GSTM3 are
expressed in muscle and brain, respectively.

Vorachek et al. (1991) isolated a cDNA for GSTM2 from a human myoblast
cDNA library and determined its sequence. The deduced 217-amino acid
protein has a molecular mass of 25,599 Da. It shares 84.8% sequence
identity with the GSTM1 protein.

MAPPING

Taylor et al. (1991) demonstrated that GSTM2 and GSTM4 (138333) are
located on the same cosmid. Pearson et al. (1993) isolated a YAC clone
containing all 5 GSTM genes, GSTM1-5; using this clone, they mapped all
of these genes to 1p13.3 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Milstien et al. (1996) purified and characterized a protein in rat that
bound to GTP cyclohydrolase I (600225) and exhibited
tetrahydrobiopterin-dependent inhibition of that enzyme. They found that
this regulatory protein, which they termed GFRP, consists of a homodimer
of 9.5-kD subunits and has a molecular mass of 20 kD. Milstien et al.
(1996) used peptide sequences to clone the corresponding rat cDNA which
encodes an 84-amino acid polypeptide. Northern blot analysis of rat
tissues revealed that a 0.8-kb GFRP transcript was expressed at
relatively high levels in liver and kidney and at somewhat lower levels
in testis, heart, brain, and lung. Milstien et al. (1996) suggested that
GFRP may play a role in regulating phenylalanine metabolism in the liver
and in the production of biogenic amine neurotransmitters and nitric
oxide.

;;CHROMOSOME 10 OPEN READING FRAME 132; C10ORF132
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By PCR of human brain, Steck et al. (2007) cloned GOLGA7B, which they
called C10ORF132. The deduced 167-amino acid protein shares 78% identity
with GOLGA7 (609453). RT-PCR detected GOLGA7B expression in human brain,
but not in lung or chondrocytes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Steck et al. (2007) determined that the GOLGA7B gene contains 5 exons
and spans about 17.8 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Steck et al. (2007) mapped the GOLGA7B
gene to chromosome 10q22. The 3-prime exon of the GOLGA7B gene overlaps
the 3-prime exon of the CRTAC1 gene (606276), which is transcribed from
the opposite strand.

;;SU48;;
KIAA0844
TALANIN, INCLUDED; TALN, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned ZNF365, which they designated
KIAA0844. The deduced protein contains 407 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected high expression in brain and intermediate to low expression in
heart, lung, skeletal muscle, kidney, pancreas, spleen, testis, and
ovary. Little to no expression was detected in liver.

By positional cloning in the uric acid nephrolithiasis (UAN; 605990)
critical region on chromosome 10q, Gianfrancesco et al. (2003)
identified a novel gene, which they designated ZNF365. By database
searching, RT-PCR, and 3-prime and 5-prime RACE, they obtained a
full-length ZNF365 cDNA. They found that the ZNF365 gene encodes at
least 4 deduced protein isoforms of 407, 333, 462, and 216 amino acids,
designated ZNF365A-D, respectively. Northern blot analysis revealed
ubiquitous expression of a 5-kb ZNF36A transcript but no signal for the
other isoforms. By RT-PCR analysis, ZNF365A (KIAA0844) was expressed at
high levels in brain and at low levels in other tissues; ZNF365B is
expressed in placenta and at low levels in lung and liver; ZNF365C is
expressed only in kidney and pancreas; and ZNF365D is expressed in
placenta, lung, liver, kidney, and pancreas. Gianfrancesco et al. (2003)
found that the ZNF365D isoform, which they called talanin, was
completely included in the 67-kb critical interval identified for UAN by
linkage studies. Computer-assisted analysis revealed that ZNF365D has at
least 1 membrane-spanning domain and several N- and O-glycosylation
consensus sites at the N terminus, suggesting that it may be an integral
membrane protein.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunofluorescence microscopy, Wang et al. (2006) found that ZNF365A,
which they called SU48, localized to the centrosome throughout the cell
cycle in several human cell lines. The centrosomal localization of
ZNF365A was not affected by a microtubule depolymerizing agent. Mutation
analysis showed that the centrosomal localization of ZNF365A required 2
coiled-coil subdomains, but not the C-terminal zinc finger structure.
The coiled-coil structure was also involved in formation of homodimers
or multimeric assemblies. Overexpression of ZNF365A caused abnormal
mitosis, and a mutant form of ZNF365A lacking the C-terminal region
disrupted localization of gamma-tubulin (see 191135) to the centrosome.
Disruption of normal ZNF365A function led to mitotic failure, possibly
due to centrosome defects or incomplete cytokinesis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gianfrancesco et al. (2003) determined that the ZNF365 gene contains 15
exons spanning approximately 300 kb. The gene has a complex pattern of
alternative splicing and transcriptional start sites.

MAPPING

By positional cloning, Gianfrancesco et al. (2003) identified the ZNF365
gene within the UAN critical region on chromosome 10q21-q22.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Gianfrancesco et al. (2003) performed mutation analysis of the ZNF365
gene in 8 patients with UAN and identified an ala62-to-thr mutation in
exon 12 of the ZNF365D isoform (A62T; 607818.0001), which was in strong
association with the disorder (P = 0.0051). Moreover, A62T modified
predicted protein secondary structure, suggesting that it may have a
role in UAN etiology.

For a discussion of a possible association between mammographic density
and variation in the ZNF365 gene, see 607308.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
URIC ACID NEPHROLITHIASIS, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
ZNF365, ALA62THR

In 8 patients with uric acid nephrolithiasis (605990), Gianfrancesco et
al. (2003) identified an ala62-to-thr (A62T) mutation in exon 12 of the
ZNF365 gene. Comparison of allelic frequency in a selected sample of 34
cases and 53 controls showed strong association between uric acid
nephrolithiasis and the A62T variant (P = 0.0096) with a significant
increase in risk (OR 2.73). The estimated penetrance of A62T showed an
increasing trend across genotypes: the penetrances of ala/ala
homozygotes, ala/thr heterozygotes, and thr/thr homozygotes were 17.6%,
32.3%, and 44.8%, respectively. Prediction of protein secondary
structure suggested that the substitution of threonine for alanine
causes a significant conformational change that may have important
implications for the biologic function of the ZNF365D protein or its
interaction with other proteins.

605405	TITLE *605405 USP6 N-TERMINAL-LIKE; USP6NL
;;RELATED TO THE N TERMINUS OF TRE; RNTRE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing cDNAs randomly selected from a cDNA library derived from
the human immature myeloid cell line KG-1, Nomura et al. (1994) isolated
a cDNA encoding a protein they designated KIAA0019. Matoskova et al.
(1996) identified a cDNA encoding KIAA0019 by searching for cDNAs
encoding proteins that bind to the SH3 domain of EPS8 (600206). Because
the 828-amino acid protein encoded by this cDNA shows homology to the
N-terminal region of the TRE oncogene (see 604334), the authors
designated it RNTRE, for 'related to the N terminus of TRE.' RNTRE was
shown to be ubiquitously expressed. The regional homology between RNTRE
and TRE, which is limited to their N-terminal portion, prompted
Matoskova et al. (1996) to investigate the origin of the TRE oncogene
transcriptional unit. They showed that TRE is the fusion product of a
5-prime genetic element homologous to RNTRE and a 3-prime element
encoding a deubiquitinating enzyme. Moreover, they identified within the
N terminus of RNTRE and TRE a TRE homology (TRH) domain, which is
conserved within several proteins from yeast to mammal and has
protein-binding properties in vitro.

GENE FUNCTION

Matoskova et al. (1996) demonstrated that the product of the RNTRE gene
is a 97- to 100-kD protein that stably associates in vivo and in vitro
with EPS8 via the SH3 domain of the latter. In vitro, RNTRE displayed
remarkable preference for binding to the SH3 domain of EPS8, compared
with 8 other SH3s. A C-terminal truncated mutant of RNTRE was able to
confer proliferative advantage and reduced serum requirement to NIH 3T3
fibroblasts, suggesting a role for RNTRE in cell proliferation.

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; 131550) signaling involves small
GTPases of the Rho family, and EGFR trafficking involves small GTPases
of the Rab family. Lanzetti et al. (2000) reported that the EPS8 protein
connects these signaling pathways. EPS8 is a substrate of EGFR that is
held in a complex with SOS1 (182530) by the adaptor protein E3B1
(603050), thereby mediating activation of RAC (602048). Through its SH3
domain, EPS8 interacts with RNTRE. Lanzetti et al. (2000) showed that
RNTRE is a RAB5 (179512) GTPase-activating protein (GAP) whose activity
is regulated by EGFR. By entering in a complex with EPS8, RNTRE acts on
RAB5 and inhibits internalization of the EGFR. Furthermore, RNTRE
diverts EPS8 from its RAC-activating function, resulting in the
attenuation of RAC signaling. Thus, depending on its state of
association with E3B1 or RNTRE, EPS8 participates in both EGFR signaling
through RAC and EGFR trafficking through RAB5. Lanzetti et al. (2000)
showed that 2 arginine residues (arg106 and arg150 of RNTRE) are highly
conserved in TRH domains. In addition, an aspartate residue (asp147 of
RNTRE) is invariant. Mutations of any of these residues to alanine
resulted in proteins that were unable to display GAP activity on RAB5.

Lanzetti et al. (2004) demonstrated that RAB5 is indispensable for a
form of receptor tyrosine kinase-induced actin remodeling called
circular ruffling. Three independent signals, originating from RAB5,
phosphatidylinositol-3-hydroxykinase, and RAC (see 602048),
respectively, are simultaneously required for the induction of circular
ruffles. RAB5 signals to the actin cytoskeleton through RNTRE, a
RAB5-specific GTPase-activating protein (GAP). Lanzetti et al. (2004)
demonstrated that RNTRE has the dual function of RAB5-GAP and RAB5
effector. They also showed that RNTRE is critical for macropinocytosis,
a process connected to the formation of circular ruffles. Finally, RNTRE
interacts with both F-actin and actinin-4 (604638), an F-actin bundling
protein. Lanzetti et al. (2004) proposed that RNTRE establishes a
3-pronged connection with RAB5, F-actin, and actinin-4. This may aid
crosslinking of actin fibers into actin networks at the plasma membrane.
Lanzetti et al. (2004) concluded that they showed that RAB5 is a
signaling GTPase and elucidated the major molecular elements of its
downstream pathway.

MAPPING

Matoskova et al. (1996) mapped RNTRE to 10p13, a region known to be
involved in translocations in various leukemias. In addition, a 10p13
monosomy syndrome, characterized by developmental alternations, has been
reported.

604395	TITLE *604395 MutL, E. COLI, HOMOLOG OF, 3; MLH3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

DNA mismatch repair (MMR) is important because of its role in
maintaining genomic integrity and its association with hereditary
nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC; see 120435). To identify new human
mismatch repair proteins, Lipkin et al. (2000) probed nuclear extracts
with the conserved C-terminal interaction domain of MLH1 (120436). They
described the cloning and complete genomic sequence of MLH3, which
encodes a DNA mismatch repair protein that interacts with MLH1. They
found that MLH3 is more similar to mismatch repair proteins from yeast,
plants, worms, and bacteria than to any known mammalian protein,
suggesting that its conserved sequence may confer unique functions in
mice and humans. Cells in culture stably expressing a dominant-negative
MLH3 protein exhibited microsatellite instability.

GENE FUNCTION

To investigate whether MLH3 acts during meiotic recombination,
(Santucci-Darmanin et al. (2002)) analyzed its expression in mammalian
germ cells. The MLH3 gene was expressed in mouse meiotic cells and in
human testis, and immunoprecipitation assays revealed that the MLH3
protein was found in mouse spermatocytes. The meiosis-specific MSH4
(602105) protein, known to participate in meiotic recombination,
coimmunoprecipitated with MLH3 from mouse meiotic cell extracts. Two
MLH3 protein isoforms potentially expressed in human testis (MLH3 and
MLH3-delta-7) interacted in vitro with the MSH4 protein. The authors
suggested that MLH3 is associated with MSH4 in mammalian meiotic cells,
and that MLH3 may play a role in mammalian meiotic recombination.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization using mouse and human BACs, Lipkin
et al. (2000) mapped the respective MLH3 genes to human 14q24.3 and
mouse 12.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Somatic Mutation in Colorectal Cancer

Malfunction of the mismatch repair system results in a mutator
phenotype, which is manifested as microsatellite instability (MSI). MSI
is often divided into 2 forms: MSI-high (MSI-H) and MSI-low (MSI-L),
based quantitatively on the observed frequency of genomic mutations
(Boland et al., 1998). Lipkin et al. (2001) screened 36 colon tumors and
discovered an appreciable frequency of somatic MLH3 coding mutations in
MSI-H tumors (25%). They found mutations in 8- and 9-bp polyadenine
mononucleotide runs that resulted in frameshift. The 8-bp run extended
from coding nucleotides 1747 to 1755; the 9-bp run extended from 2014 to
2021. In 4 of 6 tumors, evidence of biallelic inactivation was noted.
Furthermore, MLH3 nonsense mutations were identified in 2 of 12
microsatellite-stable (MSS) tumors with 14q24 loss of heterozygosity
(see 604395.0001). Screening of 60 probands with increased genetic risk
factors for colorectal cancer susceptibility demonstrated no germline
mutations of MLH3 and no mutations in other candidate genes. While the
analyses did not exclude the existence of germline MLH3 mutations in
some such patients, they suggested that they are at most uncommon. The
finding of an appreciable frequency of somatic MLH3 mutations was
considered consistent with a possible role for this gene in the
progression of colorectal cancer tumorigenesis.

- Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer 7

Wu et al. (2001) investigated the possible role of MLH3 in hereditary
nonpolyposis colorectal cancer by scanning for mutations in 39 HNPCC
families and in 288 patients suspected of having HNPCC. They identified
10 different germline MLH3 variants, 1 frameshift and 9 missense
mutations, in 12 patients suspected of HNPCC. In 3 of the 12 patients, a
mutation was also found in MSH6 (600678). Eight of the 10 mutations were
situated in exon 1, 1 was in exon 11, and 1 was in exon 12. The same
group (Ou et al., 2009) found that all of the reported MLH3 variants
were expressed normally, localized normally in the cell nucleus, and
interacted normally with MLH1. Ou et al. (2009) concluded that there is
no evidence to support a role for MLH3 variants in HNPCC, although a
role for such variants in tumorigenesis cannot be fully excluded.

Liu et al. (2003) identified 12 variants in the MLH3 gene (see, e.g.,
604395.0005-604395.0008) in 16 (23%) of 70 probands of families with
colorectal cancer (HNPCC7; 614385), some of whom had relatives with
endometrial cancer. Most mutations showed reduced penetrance, suggesting
that MLH3 is a low-risk gene and may work together with other factors in
an additive manner. None of the tumors with MLH3 mutations showed
microsatellite instability, indicating that MLH3 does not contribute to
carcinogenesis through impaired DNA mismatch repair function.

- Esophageal Cancer

In a cohort of patients with esophageal cancer (133239), Liu et al.
(2006) found that while MLH3 is a high-risk gene with a reduced
penetrance in some families, it acts as a low-risk gene in most
families, and may work together with other genes in an accumulated
manner. They concluded that MLH3 mutations may predispose to esophageal
cancer in some families.

- Endometrial Cancer

Taylor et al. (2006) analyzed the MLH3 gene in 57 women with endometrial
cancer (608089). One patient had a germline variant (T942I) and loss of
heterozygosity at the MLH3 locus in the tumor tissue. A germline
heterozygous P844L polymorphism was found in 61% of patients. Somatic
MLH3 mutations were identified in 3 of 57 tumors. Functional expression
studies were not performed. Taylor et al. (2006) concluded that MLH3
mutations may play a role in a subset of endometrial cancers.

ANIMAL MODEL

Lipkin et al. (2000) stated that mouse Mlh3 is highly expressed in
gastrointestinal epithelium and physically maps to the mouse complex
trait locus colon cancer susceptibility-1 (Ccs1). Although Lipkin et al.
(2000) were unable to identify a mutation in the protein-coding region
of Mlh3 in the susceptible mouse strain, colon tumors from congenic Ccs1
mice exhibited microsatellite instability. Functional redundancy among
Mlh3, Pms1 (600258), and Pms2 (600259) may explain why neither Pms1 nor
Pms2 mutant mice develop colon cancer, and why PMS1 and PMS2 mutations
are only rarely found in HNPCC families.

To assess the role of Mlh3 in mammalian meiosis, Lipkin et al. (2002)
generated and characterized Mlh3 -/- mice. They showed that the null
mice are viable but sterile. Mlh3 is required for Mlh1 binding to
meiotic chromosomes and localizes to meiotic chromosomes from the
mid-pachynema stage of prophase I. Mlh3 -/- spermatocytes reached
metaphase before succumbing to apoptosis, but oocytes failed to complete
meiosis I after fertilization. The results showed that Mlh3 has an
essential and distinct role in mammalian meiosis.

COLORECTAL CANCER, SOMATIC
MLH3, 2483G-T

In a colorectal cancer (114500) sample that showed loss of
heterozygosity at 14q24, Lipkin et al. (2001) identified a 2483G-T
transversion that converted codon GAG (glu) to TAG (stop) in the MLH3
gene.

RECLASSIFIED - VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
MLH3, GLN24GLU

This variant, formerly titled COLON CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS,
TYPE 7, has been reclassified based on the findings of Korhonen et al.
(2008) and Ou et al. (2009).

Wu et al. (2001) identified a 70C-G transversion in exon 1 of the MLH3
gene, resulting in a missense gln24-to-glu (Q24E) amino acid change in a
patient with HNPCC. There was no associated mutation found in MSH6
(600678).

By in vitro functional expression studies, Ou et al. (2009) determined
that the Q24E MLH3 variant was expressed normally, localized normally in
the cell nucleus, and interacted normally with MLH1 (120436). In silico
analysis suggested no damaging effect of the change. Independent studies
by Korhonen et al. (2008) showed that the Q24E variant functioned
normally and was able to complement mismatch repair defects in cell
lines. Ou et al. (2009) concluded that there is no evidence to support a
role for this variant in HNPCC, although a role for the variant in
tumorigenesis cannot be fully excluded.

gene, resulting in an asn499-to-ser (N499S) amino acid change, in a
patient with HNPCC.

By in vitro functional expression studies, Ou et al. (2009) determined
that the N499S MLH3 variant was expressed normally, localized normally
in the cell nucleus, and interacted normally with MLH1 (120436). In
silico analysis suggested a possibly damaging effect of the change. Ou
et al. (2009) concluded that there is no evidence to support a role for
this variant in HNPCC, although a role for the variant in tumorigenesis
cannot be fully excluded.

.0004
RECLASSIFIED - VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
MLH3, GLU624GLN

This variant, formerly titled COLON CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS,
TYPE 7, has been reclassified based on the findings of Ou et al. (2009).

In 2 unrelated probands with HNPCC, Wu et al. (2001) found an 1870G-C
transversion in exon 1 of the MLH3 gene, predicted to result in a
glu624-to-gln (E624Q) amino acid change. Immunohistochemical analysis
demonstrated the expression of MSH2 (609309), MLH1 (see 120436), and
MSH6 (600678) in 1 patient.

Liu et al. (2003) identified the E624Q substitution in 1 patient with
familial colorectal cancer. However, none of 6 other affected family
members carried this variant, and it was found in 3.2% of controls.

By in vitro functional expression studies, Ou et al. (2009) determined
that the N499S MLH3 variant was expressed normally, localized normally
in the cell nucleus, and interacted normally with MLH1 (120436). In
silico analysis suggested no damaging effect of the change. Ou et al.
(2009) concluded that there is no evidence to support a role for this

MLH3, GLU1451LYS

This variant, formerly titled COLON CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS,
TYPE 7, has been reclassified based on the findings of Ou et al. (2009)
and Korhonen et al. (2008).

In 2 probands with HNPCC, Wu et al. (2001) identified a heterozygous a
4351G-A transition in exon 12 of the MLH3 gene, predicted to result in a
glu1451-to-lys (E1451K) amino acid substitution. Both probands were also
compound heterozygous for a mutation in the MSH6 gene (V878A;
600678.0006 and 650insT; 600678.0007, respectively).

Liu et al. (2003) identified the E1451K mutation in a patient with
colorectal cancer and in her sister with endometrial cancer (608089).
However, the mutation was not found in another sister with colorectal
cancer and was not found in 90 control individuals.

Kim et al. (2007) identified the E1451K variant in healthy Korean
controls and concluded that it is a polymorphism in that population.

By in vitro functional expression studies, Ou et al. (2009) determined
that the E1451K MLH3 variant was expressed normally, localized normally
in the cell nucleus, and interacted normally with MLH1 (120436). In
silico analysis suggested no damaging effect of the change. Independent
studies by Korhonen et al. (2008) showed that the E1451K variant
functioned normally and was able to complement mismatch repair defects
in cell lines. Ou et al. (2009) concluded that there is no evidence to
support a role for this variant in HNPCC, although a role for the
variant in tumorigenesis cannot be fully excluded.

COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 7
ENDOMETRIAL CANCER, INCLUDED
MLH3, 1-BP DEL, 885G

In a patient with colorectal cancer (HNPCC7; 614385), Liu et al. (2003)
identified a 1-bp deletion (885delG) in exon 1 of the MLH3 gene,
predicted to result in a frameshift and premature termination. The
mutation was found in another family member with colorectal cancer, in 1
family member with endometrial cancer (608089), and in 1 of 3 unaffected
relatives over the age of 75 years, indicating reduced penetrance. The
mutation was not found in 96 controls.

.0007
ENDOMETRIAL CANCER
COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 7, INCLUDED
MLH3, VAL741PHE

In a mother and daughter with endometrial cancer (608089), Liu et al.
(2003) identified a heterozygous 2221G-T transversion in exon 1 of the
MLH3 gene, resulting in a val741-to-phe (V741F) substitution. An
unaffected aunt, over the age of 80 years, also carried the mutation,
indicating reduced penetrance. The mutation was not found in 95
controls.

Kim et al. (2007) identified a V741F mutation in a 71-year-old man with
colon cancer (HNPCC7; 614385). His 2 sisters developed gastric cancer
and breast cancer at ages 57 and 61, respectively. The authors suggested
moderate penetrance for this variant.

.0008
COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 7
MLH3, TRP1276ARG

In 4 sibs with HNPCC (HNPCC7; 614385) without microsatellite
instability, Liu et al. (2003) identified a 3826T-C transition in exon 7
of the MLH3 gene, resulting in a trp1276-to-arg (W1276R) substitution.
The mutation was inherited from the mother, who had gastric cancer. The
mutation was not found in 96 controls. All 4 sibs also carried a
mutation in the MSH2 gene (609309). Liu et al. (2003) suggested that the
additive effect of these 2 mutations resulted in the phenotype. These
findings were consistent with the hypothesis that low-penetrance
additive risk alleles contribute to the risk of developing colorectal
cancer.

Liu et al. (2006) identified a W1276R substitution in 1 patient with
colorectal cancer. However, 2 unaffected family members also carried the
variant and 2 family members with esophageal cancer did not carry the
mutation.

148060	TITLE *148060 KERATIN 8; KRT8
;;K8;;
CYTOKERATIN 8
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Keratin 8 is a type II keratin (Moll et al., 1982). Endo A is the mouse
equivalent. Endo B, which is the equivalent of human keratin 18
(148070), a type I keratin, is coexpressed with Endo A; the 2 appear to
be the first intermediate filament (IF) proteins expressed during murine
development (Jackson et al., 1980). Yamamoto et al. (1990) studied a
full-length cDNA for cytokeratin 8 from placenta. They determined the
distribution of cytokeratin 8 mRNA in various fetal tissues and in
placentae of different gestational ages.

Krauss and Franke (1990) cloned cytokeratin 8 from a genomic library.
The 485-amino acid protein deduced from the exon sequences has a
calculated molecular mass of about 53.5 kD. CK8 shows strong homology
with the corresponding bovine, mouse, and Xenopus proteins. The human
and mouse CK8 share about 82% identity in the N-terminal head domain,
95% identity in the alpha helical rod domain, and 67.5% identity in the
C-terminal tail.

GENE FUNCTION

He et al. (2002) presented evidence that soluble depolymerized K8
subunits were phosphorylated on ser73 by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK1;
601158) upon stimulation of the proapoptotic cytokine receptor Fas
(134637) in colon carcinoma cells. K8 was also phosphorylated following
exposure to ultraviolet light. Coimmunoprecipitation studies indicated
that JNK interacted directly with K8, and K8 was able to sequester a
substantial amount of the 54-kD isoform of JNK. The association of JNK
with K8 correlated with the decreased ability of JNK to phosphorylate
endogenous c-Jun (see 165160). He et al. (2002) hypothesized that K8
phosphorylation could regulate JNK signaling and/or keratin dynamics. Ku
et al. (2002) reported the phosphorylation of K8 ser73 by p38
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK14; 600289). p38 MAPK associated
with K8/K18 complexes in transfected baby hamster kidney cells,
phosphorylated K8 on ser73, and bound specifically to K8 in vitro. Ku et
al. (2002) noted that the leu160-to-pro mutation in K1 (139350.0002)
leads to epidermolytic hyperkeratosis (113800). The comparable mutation
in K8 resulted in hyperphosphorylation of K8 due to neophosphorylation
of ser70 in addition to phosphorylation of ser73, and keratin filament
collapse in the presence of okadaic acid, a phosphatase inhibitor.

GENE STRUCTURE

Krauss and Franke (1990) determined that the CK8 gene contains 8 exons
instead of 9 as is found in all other type II cytokeratins due to lack
of intron 5, and the gene spans over 8.8 kb. The 5-prime flanking region
contains a TATA box, 1 SP1 (189906) motif, and an Alu-like sequence in
an orientation opposite that of the CK8 gene. Intron 1 is long (about
2.5 kb) and contains 3 SP1 sites, 1 AP1 (see 165160) site, and another
Alu element in the same orientation as CK8.

MAPPING

Keratins 8 and 18 of simple epithelia differ from the keratins of
stratified epithelia in tissue expression and regulation. Using PCR to
study DNAs from somatic cell hybrids, Waseem et al. (1990) located a
single active gene for keratin 8 on chromosome 12. This chromosome
contains several genes for type II keratins and also the gene for
keratin 18, the type I keratin that is coexpressed with keratin 8. This
location of both members of a keratin pair on a single chromosome is
unique among keratin genes; it is consistent with the hypothesis that
keratins 8 and 18 may be closer to an ancestral gene than the keratins
of more highly differentiated epithelia.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

About 10% of patients who undergo liver transplantation have cryptogenic
liver disease. In animal models, the absence of heteropolymeric keratins
8 and 18 or the presence of mutant keratins in hepatocytes causes or
promotes liver disease. Ku et al. (1997) demonstrated a germline
mutation in keratin 18 (148070.0001) in 1 of 28 patients with
cryptogenic cirrhosis (see 215600). Of 55 patients with cryptogenic
liver disease screened by Ku et al. (2001), 5 unrelated patients had
mutations in the keratin 8 gene that appeared to have predisposed them
to the disease. Three patients had a gly61-to-cys mutation at a highly
conserved glycine (148060.0001), and the other 2 had a tyr53-to-his
mutation (148060.0002). These mutations were not detected in patients
with other forms of liver disease or in randomly selected patients. In
transfected cells, the gly61-to-cys mutation limited keratin filament
reorganization when the cells were exposed to oxidative stress. In
contrast, the tyr53-to-his mutation destabilized keratin filaments when
transfected cells were exposed to heat or okadaic acid stress.

Following up on the observation that KRT8 and KRT18 mutations are found
in patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis, Ku et al. (2003) investigated
the role of keratin mutations in noncryptogenic cirrhosis and the
incidence of keratin mutations in the general population. The results
suggested that K8 and K18 are likely susceptibility genes for developing
both cryptogenic and noncryptogenic forms of liver disease. They studied
314 liver explants of patients who primarily had noncryptogenic
cirrhosis and compared the results with 349 blood bank volunteers. Seven
unique K8/K18 mutations were found in 11 independent patients with
biliary atresia, hepatitis B/C, alcoholism, primary biliary cirrhosis,
and fulminant hepatitis. Seven of the 11 patients had mutations
previously described in patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis: gly61 to
cys (148060.0001), tyr53 to his (148060.0002), and his127 to leu
(148070.0001). Of the 349 blood bank control samples, only 1 contained
the tyr53-to-his mutation and 1 the gly61-to-cys mutation. Livers with
keratin mutations had cytoplasmic filamentous deposits that were less
frequent in livers without the mutations (P = 0.03).

ANIMAL MODEL

Casanova et al. (1999) generated mice expressing the human KRT8 gene,
leading to a moderate increase in the content of keratin in simple
epithelia. These mice displayed progressive exocrine pancreas
alterations, including dysplasia and loss of acinar architecture,
redifferentiation of acinar to ductal cells, inflammation, fibrosis, and
substitution of exocrine by adipose tissue, as well as increased cell
proliferation and apoptosis. The phenotype was very similar to that
reported for transgenic mice expressing a dominant-negative mutant
TGF-beta type II receptor (TGFBR2; 190182). Casanova et al. (1999)
showed that these Tgfbr2 mutant mice also had elevated KRT8/KRT18
levels. The results indicated that simple epithelial keratins play a
relevant role in the regulation of exocrine pancreas homeostasis and
supported the idea that disruption of mechanisms that normally regulate
keratin expression in vivo could be related to inflammatory and
neoplastic pancreatic disorders.

Jaquemar et al. (2003) determined that the lethality seen in genetically
sensitive K8-null mouse embryos is due to disruption of the trophoblast
giant cell layer that normally forms a barrier between the maternal and
embryonic compartments. Massive hemorrhages of maternal blood were found
between the decidua capsularis and the parietal yolk sac. Maternal tumor
necrosis factor (TNF; 191160) and TNF receptor (see 191190) contributed
to the lethality.

In 3 of 55 patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis (see 215600), Ku et al.

gene.

Ku et al. (2003) found the G61C mutation in a few patients with
noncryptogenic cirrhosis, and concluded that this mutation causes
susceptibility to noncryptogenic cirrhosis.

607233	TITLE *607233 MAS-RELATED G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR FAMILY, MEMBER F; MRGPRF
;;MRGF;;
RAT THORACIC ARTERY PROTEIN, HOMOLOG OF; RTA
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Ross et al. (1990) cloned rat Mrgprf, which they called Rta. The deduced
343-amino acid protein has 7 transmembrane domains and is most closely
related to the human MAS1 oncogene (165180), with which it shares 34%
amino acid identity.

Dong et al. (2001) identified, in the mouse and human genomes, a family
of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) related to the MAS1 oncogene,
including MRGPRF, which they called MRGF. Several pseudogenes were also
identified. The predicted MRG proteins contain transmembrane,
extracellular, and cytoplasmic domains. A subset of MRGs was expressed
in specific subpopulations of sensory neurons that detect painful
stimuli. The expression patterns of these genes thus revealed an
unexpected degree of molecular diversity among nociceptive neurons. Some
MRGs could be specifically activated in heterologous cells by RFamide
neuropeptides, such as NPFF and NPAF (see 604643), which are analgesic
in vivo. The authors concluded that MRGs may regulate nociceptor
function and/or development, including the sensation or modulation of
pain.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Dong et al. (2001) mapped the MRGF gene to
chromosome 11.

605716	TITLE *605716 POTASSIUM CHANNEL, VOLTAGE-GATED, SUBFAMILY H, MEMBER 5; KCNH5
DESCRIPTION Voltage-gated potassium channels, which constitute an evolutionarily
related superfamily, play an essential role in controlling cellular
excitability in the nervous system by regulating a variety of neuronal
properties, such as interspike membrane potential, action potential
waveform, and firing frequency.

By EST database searching, Occhiodoro et al. (1998) identified an EST
isolated from an adult brain cDNA library that showed significant
homology to the rat ether-a-go-go (eag) voltage-gated potassium channel
(see KCNH1; 603305) and to a human cDNA clone mapping to chromosome 14
(TMAP WI-6411). Sequencing of the clone indicated that the deduced
protein, designated KCNH5, shares 58% sequence identity with KCNH1 over
a total overlap of 457 amino acids. RT-PCR showed that KCNH5 is not
expressed in differentiating myoblasts. Northern blot analysis detected
expression of an approximately 11-kb transcript in adult brain tissue
only.

142600	TITLE *142600 HEXOKINASE 1; HK1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1) catalyzes the first step in glucose metabolism,
using ATP for the phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate.
Four different forms of hexokinase, designated type HK1, HK2 (601125),
HK3 (142570), and HK4 (138079), encoded by different genes, are present
in mammalian tissues. Among these, HK1 is the predominant glucose
phosphorylating activity in those tissues that share a strict dependence
on glucose utilization for their physiologic functions, such as brain,
erythrocytes, platelets, lymphocytes, and fibroblasts (summary by
Bianchi et al., 1997). Different isoforms of HK1 are either cytoplasmic
or associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) through a
5-prime porin (VDAC1; 604492)-binding domain (Murakami and Piomelli,
1997).

CLONING

Nishi et al. (1988) analyzed cDNA clones encoding human hexokinase
isolated from an adult kidney library. Analysis of this 917-amino acid
protein showed that the sequences of the N- and C-terminal halves,
corresponding to the regulatory and catalytic domains, respectively, are
homologous. Eukaryotic hexokinases evolved from duplication of a gene
encoding a protein of about 450 amino acids. Griffin et al. (1991)
thought that comparisons of sequences in many species supported the
theory of Ureta (1982) that the mammalian hexokinases arose from the
duplication and fusion of an ancestral protoenzyme and that the yeast
and mammalian glucokinases arose twice in evolution. Sequence analysis
demonstrated that a 15-amino acid porin-binding domain in the N terminus
of HK1 is absolutely conserved and mediates the binding of HK1 to the
mitochondria. In the course of their work, Griffin et al. (1991)
developed a method for cloning the cDNA for a low abundance protein
using knowledge of the evolutionary conservation of amino acid and
nucleotide sequence.

By liquid chromatography, Murakami et al. (1990) identified 2 distinct
major isozymes of human red blood cell (RBC) hexokinase. One had a
molecular mass similar to that of HK1 identified in liver, and the
other, designated HKR, was larger than HK1 by several kilodaltons. RBC
from normal blood contained HK1 and HKR at an equal activity, but in
reticulocyte-rich RBC, HKR dominated. Murakami and Piomelli (1997)
isolated a cDNA clone for the red cell-specific HK isozyme HKR. Its
nucleotide sequence was identical to HK1 cDNA except for the 5-prime
end. It lacks the first 62 nucleotides of the HK1 coding region;
instead, it contains a unique sequence of 60 nucleotides at the
beginning of the coding sequence as well as another unique sequence
upstream of the putative translation initiation site. It lacks the
porin-binding domain that facilitates binding to mitochondria, thus
explaining the exclusive cytoplasmic localization of red blood cell HK.
Northern blot analysis showed that it was expressed in reticulocytes and
in an erythroleukemic cell line, but not in a lymphocytic cell line.

Mori et al. (1996) reported the cloning of cDNAs representing 3 unique
human type 1 hexokinase mRNAs expressed in testis, which were not
detected by Northern blot analysis in other human tissues. These mRNAs
contained unique sequences in the 5-prime terminus and lacked the
porin-binding domain (PBD), a conserved sequence that mediates the
binding of hexokinase to the mitochondria. The sequences were similar to
those identified by Mori et al. (1993) in mouse testis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ruzzo et al. (1998) determined that the HK1 gene contains 18 exons and
spans about 75 kb. Analysis of the 5-prime flanking region revealed
binding sites for AP1 and CRE as well as several binding sites for SP1.
Ruzzo et al. (1998) identified an exon 1 specific to HK1 expressed in
somatic cells; an alternative exon (exon 1R) transcribed in red blood
cells replaced the somatic exon 1 by alternative splicing. Exon 1R lacks
the porin-binding domain.

Andreoni et al. (2000) found that multiple testis-specific HK1
transcripts are encoded by 6 different exons; 5 of the exons are located
upstream from the somatic exon 1, and one is located within intron 1.
With identification of these additional exons, they determined that the
gene spans at least 100 kb.

MAPPING

Shows (1974) presented evidence from somatic cell hybrid experiments
that hexokinase and cytoplasmic glutamate oxaloacetic transaminase are
syntenic on chromosome 10. By gene dosage studies of fibroblasts,
Gitelman and Simpson (1982) mapped HK1 to 10p11-q23. By dosage effect,
Dallapiccola et al. (1981) narrowed the HK1 assignment to 10pter-p13.
Dallapiccola et al. (1984) determined HK1 activity in the red cells of 5
patients with various partial duplications of 10p and concluded that the
most likely regional assignment for HK1 is 10p11.2. By in situ
hybridization, Shows et al. (1989) regionalized the HK1 gene to 10q22.
Daniele et al. (1992) used an HK1 cDNA as a probe for the study of a
panel of human-hamster somatic cell hybrids to assign the gene to the
long arm of chromosome 10 in the region q11.2-qter. This result agrees
with those reported by Gitelman and Simpson (1982) and Shows et al.
(1989) but conflicts with that reported by Dallapiccola et al. (1984).
Daniele et al. (1992) acknowledged the possibility that the HK1 probe
they used recognized more than a single locus but concluded that if 2 or
more HK loci exist they are all located on chromosome 10. Gelb et al.
(1992) demonstrated that most of the coding region of the HK1 gene is
located in a 120-kb YAC, which mapped entirely to chromosome 10.

The genes for 3 separate hexokinases have been assigned to specific
sites as of 1997: HK1, a red-cell isoform, to chromosome 10; HK2
(601125), the major hexokinase expressed in skeletal muscle, to
chromosome 2; and HK3 (142570), an isoform in white blood cells, to
chromosome 5. Hexokinase-4 (HK4) is glucokinase (GCK; 138079), which
maps to chromosome 7.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Nonspherocytic Hemolytic Anemia Due to Hexokinase Deficiency

Bianchi and Magnani (1995) reported the molecular characterization of
the defect in HK1 in a patient with hemolytic anemia due to hexokinase
deficiency (235700). PCR amplification and sequence of the cDNA revealed
compound heterozygosity for a deletion and a single nucleotide
substitution. The 96-bp deletion (142600.0001) involved nucleotides 577
to 672 of their cDNA sequence and was found in the cDNA of none of 14
unrelated normal subjects. The sequence of the HK1 allele without
deletion showed a T-to-C transition of nucleotide 1677, which caused the
amino acid change leu529-to-ser (142600.0002). The substitution was not
found in 10 normal controls. Bianchi and Magnani (1995) stated that to
their knowledge only 14 cases had been described, 2 of which had been
studied in their laboratory: HK-Melzo and HK-Napoli. It was in HK-Melzo
that the molecular defect was demonstrated. They showed that in the
HK-Melzo variant, the HK deficiency was expressed not only in
erythrocytes but also in platelets, lymphocytes, and fibroblasts. All
these types of cells contain HK type I as the predominant glucose
phosphorylating enzyme and, in particular, platelets and erythrocytes
share a strict dependence upon glucose utilization for their physiologic
functions.

In a girl, born of consanguineous parents, with severe nonspherocytic
hemolytic anemia due to hexokinase deficiency previously reported by
Rijksen et al. (1983), van Wijk et al. (2003) identified a homozygous
mutation in the HK1 gene (T680S; 142600.0004). The mutation, which
segregated with the disorder in the family and was not found in 50
controls, was designated 'Utrecht.' In vitro studies of the mutant
enzyme showed that it had a 2-fold decrease in affinity for Mg-ATP2 and
a markedly decreased affinity for the inhibitor glucose-1,6-diphosphate.
Patient red cells and platelets had about 25% residual activity.

- Russe Type of Hereditary Motor and Sensory Neuropathy

In all 34 European Gypsy individuals with the Russe type of hereditary
motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSNR; 605285) who were studied, Hantke et
al. (2009) identified a homozygous sequence change in the HK1 gene
(142600.0003) that mapped within the candidate disease interval on
chromosome 10q. The mutation was located at a highly conserved
nucleotide in the putative AltT2 exon located in the 5-prime region
upstream of HK1. The variant was found in heterozygous state in 5 of 790
control individuals representing a cross-section of the Gypsy
population, but not in 233 Bulgarian controls. AltT2-containing
transcripts in the mouse peripheral nerve were rare compared to the
coding region of HK1. However, 6 of 8 testis AltT2-containing isoforms
were found, with expression patterns differing between the peripheral
nerve and the brain and between newborn and adult tissues in mice. There
was no difference in HK1 mRNA in Schwann cells derived from patients or
controls, and patient cells showed no evidence of HK1 enzyme activity
compared to controls. Bioinformatic tools did not suggest an effect of
the variant on HK1 gene splicing or binding sites for interacting
proteins. However, there was evidence that the variant may cause a
ter-to-tyr substitution in 1 upstream open reading frame that had a
non-AUG start codon, which could potentially disrupt HK1 translation
regulation. Hantke et al. (2009) speculated that non-OMM-binding HK1 may
play a role in the pathogenesis of HMSNR.

Sevilla et al. (2013) found that 11 patients from 9 Roma Gypsy families
were homozygous for the HK1 variant (g.9712G-C; 142600.0003) identified
by Hantke et al. (2009), and haplotype analysis confirmed a founder
effect in this population.

In the so-called HK-Melzo variant of hexokinase deficiency (235700),
Bianchi and Magnani (1995) demonstrated compound heterozygosity for
deletion of nucleotides 577 to 672 in the HK cDNA sequence and a
leu529-to-ser missense mutation (142600.0002).

NEUROPATHY, HEREDITARY MOTOR AND SENSORY, RUSSE TYPE
HK1, -3818-195G-C, AltT2 EXON

In all 34 individuals with the Russe type of hereditary motor and
sensory neuropathy (HMSNR; 605285) who were studied, Hantke et al.
(2009) identified 2 homozygous sequence changes in the HK1 gene, which
maps within the candidate disease interval on chromosome 10q. One was a
G-to-C transversion at a highly conserved nucleotide in the putative
AltT2 exon located in the 5-prime region upstream of HK1 (-3818-195G-C,
NM_033497; Chandler, 2013), and the other was an intronic G-to-A
transition downstream of the AltT2 change; the G-to-A transition was not
highly conserved, and thus not thought to be pathogenic. These 2
variants were found in heterozygous state in 5 of 790 control
individuals representing a cross-section of the Gypsy population, but
not in 233 Bulgarian controls. AltT2-containing transcripts in the mouse
peripheral nerve were rare compared to the coding region of HK1.
However, 6 of 8 testis AltT2-containing isoforms were found, with
expression patterns differing between the peripheral nerve and the brain
and between newborn and adult tissues in mice. There was no difference
in HK1 mRNA in Schwann cells derived from patients or controls, and
patient cells showed no evidence of HK1 enzyme activity compared to
controls. Bioinformatic tools did not suggest an effect of the G-C
change on HK1 gene splicing or binding sites for interacting proteins.
However, there was evidence that the G-C change may cause a ter-to-tyr
substitution in 1 upstream open reading frame that had a non-AUG start
codon, which could potentially disrupt HK1 translation regulation.
Hantke et al. (2009) speculated that non-OMM-binding HK1 may play a role
in the pathogenesis of HMSNR.

Sevilla et al. (2013) found that 11 patients from 9 Roma Gypsy families
with progressive hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy were homozygous
for the HK1 variant (g.9712G-C) identified by Hantke et al. (2009), and
haplotype analysis confirmed a founder effect in this population. The
founding ancestor was estimated to have lived at the end of the 18th
century, when a population split occurred from a tribal group and the
Gypsy population in Spain increased under the rule of Charles III.

HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA, NONSPHEROCYTIC, DUE TO HEXOKINASE DEFICIENCY
HK1, THR680SER

In a girl, born of consanguineous parents, with severe nonspherocytic
hemolytic anemia due to hexokinase deficiency (235700) previously
reported by Rijksen et al. (1983), van Wijk et al. (2003) identified a
homozygous c.2039C-G transversion in exon 15 of the HK1 gene, resulting
in a thr680-to-ser (T680S) substitution at a highly conserved residue in
the active site. The mutation, which segregated with the disorder in the
family and was not found in 50 controls, was designated 'Utrecht.' In
vitro studies of the mutant enzyme showed that it had a 2-fold decrease
in affinity for Mg-ATP2 and a markedly decreased affinity for the
inhibitor glucose-1,6-diphosphate.

;;CD242 ANTIGEN; CD242;;
LW GENE; LW
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Intracellular adhesion molecule-4 (ICAM4) is a member of the
immunoglobulin (Ig) gene superfamily and encodes the Landsteiner-Wiener
(LW) blood group antigens (111250) (Bailly et al., 1994; Bailly et al.,
1995).

CLONING

Bailly et al. (1994) cloned ICAM4 cDNAs from a human bone marrow cDNA
library. One form encodes a single-spanning transmembrane protein of 270
amino acids, including a 29-amino acid signal peptide. A second form
encodes a shortened protein of 236 residues without transmembrane and
cytoplasm domains. The predicted protein shares approximately 30%
identity with intercellular adhesion molecules ICAM1 (147840), ICAM2
(146630), and ICAM3 (146631), which are the counterreceptors for the
lymphocyte function-associated antigen LFA1 (see 153370 and 600065). The
extracellular domain of ICAM4 consists, like that of ICAM2, of 2 Ig-like
domains, and the critical residues involved in binding of LFA1 to ICAMs
are partially conserved in ICAM4.

Using RT-PCR, Hermand et al. (1995) cloned ICAM4 from whole blood RNA.
The sequence was identical to that of the full-length cDNA reported by
Bailly et al. (1994) except for differences in the region encoding the
signal sequence. The corrected ICAM4 sequence reported by Hermand et al.
(1995) encodes a 271-amino acid protein with a 30-amino acid signal
peptide.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hermand et al. (1996) characterized the ICAM4 gene, which contains 3
exons spanning approximately 2.65 kb.

MAPPING

ICAM4 maps to chromosome 19p13.2, based on the previous mapping of the
LW locus to this location (Hermand et al., 1995).

GENE FUNCTION

Bailly et al. (1995) purified the ICAM4 (LW) protein from red cells and
found that the protein bound to the leukocyte CD11a/CD18 and CD11b/CD18
integrins (see 600065). They speculated that ICAM4 may be involved in
regulation of red cell turnover.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- LW Blood Group System: LW(a)/LW(b) Polymorphism

Hermand et al. (1995) determined that the LW(a)/LW(b) polymorphism of
the LW blood group system (111250) is determined by a single-basepair
substitution in the ICAM4 gene (614088.0001).

- LW Blood Group System: LW(a-b-) Phenotype

Using Southern blot analysis, Hermand et al. (1995) showed that the
ICAM4 gene was not grossly rearranged in an individual with the LW(a-b-)
phenotype of the LW blood group system (111250) or in individuals with
the Rh-null phenotype, who also lack LW antigens. RFLP analysis using
PvuII indicated that the LW(a-b-) individual and 3 Rh-null individuals
were homozygous for a phenotypically silent LW(a) allele.

In an individual with the LW(a-b-) phenotype who carried a normal Rh
phenotype, Hermand et al. (1996) found a 10-bp deletion in the ICAM4
gene (614088.0002) that generated a premature stop codon and encoded a
truncated protein without the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains.
Heterogeneity was indicated by the fact that no detectable abnormality
of the LW gene or transcript could be detected in another LW(a-b-)
individual.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
LW BLOOD GROUP SYSTEM, LW(a)/LW(b) POLYMORPHISM
ICAM4, GLN100ARG

Hermand et al. (1995) demonstrated that the molecular basis for the
LW(a)/LW(b) polymorphism of the LW blood group system (111250) is an
A-to-G change at nucleotide 299 (relative to the translation initiation
site) of the ICAM4 gene that correlates with a PvuII restriction site
and results in a gln100-to-arg (Q100R) amino acid substitution. COS-7
cells transfected with LW(a) or LW(b) cDNAs reacted with human
anti-LW(a) and anti-LW(b) sera, respectively, as well as with a murine
monoclonal anti-LW(ab) antibody, as shown by flow cytometry analysis.
Hermand et al. (1995) referred to this polymorphism as an A-to-G change
at nucleotide 308 (relative to the transcription initiation site),
resulting in a GLN70ARG (Q70R) substitution (numbering using the mature
ICAM4 protein sequence, after removal of the signal peptide).

.0002
LW BLOOD GROUP SYSTEM, LW(a-b-) PHENOTYPE
ICAM4, 10-BP DEL, NT346

In an individual with the rare LW(a-b-) phenotype of the LW blood group
system (111250) who carried a normal Rh phenotype, Hermand et al. (1996)
identified a 10-bp deletion (ACCTGCGCAG) at nucleotide 346 (relative to
the translation initiation site) in exon 1 of the ICAM4 gene. The
deletion generated a premature stop codon, resulting in a truncated
protein without the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Heterogeneity
was indicated by the fact that no detectable abnormality of the ICAM4
gene or transcript could be detected in another LW(a-b-) individual.
Hermand et al. (1996) referred to this mutation as a 10-bp deletion at
nucleotide 355 (relative to the transcription initiation site).

neurons, endocrine cells, and muscle cells. The archetypal KATP channel
is an octameric complex of KCNJ11 subunits and either SUR1 (ABCC8;
600509) subunits in pancreatic beta cells and many neurons or SUR2
(ABCC9; 601439) subunits in muscle. Four KCNJ11 subunits form the
channel pore, and each is associated with a SUR subunit that contributes
to regulation of channel gating (summary by Girard et al., 2009).

CLONING

Inagaki et al. (1995) cloned a member of the inwardly rectifying
potassium channel family, which they called BIR, for 'beta-cell inward
rectifier,' or Kir6.2, in the nomenclature of Chandy and Gutman (1993).
The channel was expressed in large amounts in rat pancreatic islets and
glucose-responsive insulin-secreting cell lines. The sequence showed a
single open reading frame encoding a 390-amino acid protein with 2
putative transmembrane segments. The mouse homolog also had a single
open reading frame encoding a 390-amino acid protein with 96% amino acid
identity with human BIR.

GENE STRUCTURE

Inagaki et al. (1995) determined that KCNJ11, the gene encoding human
BIR, is intronless in the protein-coding region. Several other genes
encoding inward rectifiers lack introns.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Inagaki et al. (1995) mapped the
BIR gene to 11p15.1. The sequence obtained from 1 lambda clone at the
3-prime end of the SUR gene (ABCC8; 600509) matched a part of the gene
encoding BIR; with a sense primer near the 3-prime end of the SUR gene
and an antisense primer near the 5-prime end of the BIR gene they
PCR-amplified an approximately 4.5-kb fragment. Thus, the authors
determined that the 2 genes are clustered at 11p15.1, with the BIR gene
immediately 3-prime of the SUR gene. The SUR gene had previously been
mapped to 11p15.1 by fluorescence in situ hybridization (Thomas et al.,
1995).

GENE FUNCTION

In pancreatic beta cells, ATP-potassium channels are crucial for the
regulation of glucose-induced insulin secretion and are the target for
the sulfonylureas, oral hypoglycemic agents widely used in the treatment
of noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM; 125853), and for
diazoxide, a potassium channel opener. The sulfonylurea receptor (SUR)
is a member of the ATP-binding cassette superfamily with multiple
transmembrane-spanning domains and 2 potential nucleotide-binding folds.
Inagaki et al. (1995) demonstrated that coexpression of BIR with SUR
reconstituted an inwardly rectifying potassium conductance of 76
picosiemens that was sensitive to ATP and was inhibited by sulfonylureas
and activated by diazoxide. The data indicated to the authors that these
pancreatic beta-cell potassium channels are a complex composed of at
least 2 subunits: BIR and SUR.

Inagaki et al. (1996) cloned rat SUR2 (601439) and found that
coexpression of SUR2 and BIR in COS-1 cells reconstituted the properties
of K(ATP) channels described in cardiac and skeletal muscle. However,
they found that the SUR2/BIR channel is less sensitive than the SUR/BIR
channel both to ATP and to the sulfonylurea glibenclamide, and is
activated by the cardiac K(ATP) channel openers cromakalim and pinacidil
but not by diazoxide. The affinity of SUR2 for sulfonylureas is 500
times lower than that of SUR.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Hyperinsulinemic Hypoglycemia

Thomas et al. (1996) screened genomic DNA from members of 15 families
with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (HHF2; 601820) for mutations in the
KCNJ11 gene. In a male infant with profound hypoglycemia, born of
consanguineous Iranian parents, Thomas et al. (1996) identified
homozygosity for a 649T-C mutation (600937.0001). His parents were
heterozygous for the mutation.

Using SSCP and nucleotide sequence analysis, Nestorowicz et al. (1997)
screened 78 patients with hyperinsulinism for mutations in the KCNJ11
gene and identified homozygosity for a nonsense mutation (600937.0009)
in 1 patient.

De Lonlay et al. (1997) showed that in cases of the focal form, but not
those of the diffuse form, of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia there was
specific loss of maternal alleles of the imprinted chromosome region
11p15 in cells of the hyperplastic area of the pancreas but not in
normal pancreatic cells. This somatic event was consistent with a
proliferative monoclonal lesion. It involves disruption of the balance
between monoallelic expression of several maternally and paternally
expressed genes. Thus, they provided the first molecular explanation for
the heterogeneity of sporadic forms of PHHI such that it is possible to
perform only partial pancreatectomy, limited to the focal somatic
lesion, so as to avoid iatrogenic diabetes in patients with focal
adenomatous hyperplasia. It is possible that in these cases of somatic
loss of maternal 11p15.1, there is reduction to homozygosity for a
recessive ABCC8 or KCNJ11 mutation on the paternal allele, since both
ABCC8 and KCNJ11 are located in the 11p15.1 region.

Tornovsky et al. (2004) screened 15 patients with neonatal
hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia for mutations in the ABCC8 and KCNJ11
genes and identified 12 mutations in 11 patients. Homozygosity for a
mutation in the promoter (600937.0010) and in exon 1 (600937.0011) of
the KCNJ11 gene were identified in an Israeli Bedouin and an Arab
patient, respectively.

Henwood et al. (2005) measured acute insulin responses (AIRs) to
calcium, leucine, glucose, and tolbutamide in 22 infants with recessive
ABCC8 or KCNJ11 mutations (see, e.g., 600937.0019), 8 of whom had
diffuse hyperinsulinism and 14 of whom had focal hyperinsulinism. Of the
24 total mutations, 7 showed evidence of residual K(ATP) channel
function: 2 of the patients with partial defects were homozygous and 4
heterozygous for amino acid substitutions or insertions, and 1 was a
compound heterozygote for 2 premature stop codons.

Lin et al. (2008) investigated the mechanisms by which
hyperinsulinism-associated mutations of arg301 (R301) in KCNJ11 (e.g.,
R301H; 600937.0019) lead to channel dysfunction. They found that R301
mutations in rat Kcnj11 resulted in reduced channel expression at the
cell surface in transfected cells and caused rapid, spontaneous current
decay, or inactivation. Mutagenesis studies indicated that R301 is near
the Kcnj11 subunit-subunit interface and likely stabilizes channel
activity. To evaluate the effects of channel inactivation on beta cell
function, Lin et al. (2008) expressed an alternative R301 mutation,
R301A, which induces channel inactivation without affecting channel
surface expression, in a rat insulinoma cell line. Expression of Kcnj11
with R301A resulted in more depolarized membrane potential and elevated
insulin secretion at basal glucose concentration compared with cells
expressing wildtype channels. Lin et al. (2008) concluded that mutations
at R301 may cause channel inactivation by disrupting subunit-subunit
interactions, and that this gating defect is sufficient to cause loss of
channel function and hyperinsulinism.

Pinney et al. (2008) identified 14 different dominantly inherited K(ATP)
channel mutations in 16 unrelated families, 13 with mutations in the
ABCC8 gene (see, e.g., 600509.0011) and 3 with mutations in the KCNJ11
gene (see, e.g., 600937.0020). Unlike recessive mutations, dominantly
inherited K(ATP) mutant subunits trafficked normally to the plasma
membrane when expressed in simian kidney cells; dominant mutations also
resulted in different channel-gating defects, with dominant ABCC8
mutations diminishing channel responses to magnesium adenosine
diphosphate or diazoxide and dominant KCNJ11 mutations impairing channel
opening even in the absence of nucleotides. Pinney et al. (2008)
concluded that there are distinctive features of dominant K(ATP)
hyperinsulinism compared to the more common and more severe recessive
form, including retention of normal subunit trafficking, impaired
channel activity, and a milder hypoglycemia phenotype that may escape
detection in infancy and is often responsive to diazoxide medical
therapy.

Taneja et al. (2009) reported that the Kir6.2 channel contains a
diacidic ER exit signal DXE at codons 280 to 282, which promotes
concentration of the channel into COPII-enriched ER exit sites prior to
ER export via a process that requires Sar1-GTPase (607690). They
identified an E282K mutation (600937.0022) in a Swedish patient with
HHF2 with focal adenomatous hyperplasia. The E282K mutation abrogated
the ER exit signal and prevented ER export and surface expression of the
channel. When coexpressed, the E282K-mutant subunit was able to
associate with the wildtype Kir6.2 and form functional channels, and
unlike most mutations did not cause protein misfolding. Since in focal
congenital hyperinsulinism, the maternal chromosome containing the
K(ATP) channel genes is lost, beta-cells of the patient lacked wildtype
Kir6.2 to rescue the mutant Kir6.2 subunit expressed from the paternal
chromosome. The resultant absence of functional KATP channels leads to
insulin hypersecretion. Taneja et al. (2009) concluded that surface
expression of K(ATP) channels is critically dependent on the
Sar1-GTPase-dependent ER exit mechanism, and abrogation of the diacidic
ER exit signal leads to congenital hyperinsulinism.

- Diabetes Mellitus Type II

Hani et al. (1998) identified an association between an E23K variant in
the KCNJ11 gene (600937.0014) and type II diabetes mellitus (125853) in
French families.

Hansen et al. (2005) studied the effects of the E23K polymorphism and a
PPARG P12A polymorphism (601487.0002) on the risk of type II diabetes
and found that the polymorphisms may act in an additive manner to
increase the risk of type II diabetes.

- Permanent Neonatal Diabetes

Because ATP-sensitive potassium channels mediate glucose-stimulated
insulin secretion from the pancreatic beta cells, Gloyn et al. (2004)
hypothesized that activating mutations in the KCNJ11 gene might cause
neonatal diabetes. They studied 29 patients with permanent neonatal
diabetes (PNDM; 606176) characterized by ketoacidosis or marked
hyperglycemia who were treated with insulin. The patients did not
secrete insulin in response to glucose or glucagon but did secrete
insulin in response to tolbutamide. Four of the patients also had severe
developmental delay and muscle weakness; 3 of them also had epilepsy and
mild dysmorphic features (DEND; see 606176). Gloyn et al. (2004)
sequenced the KCNJ11 gene in all 29 patients and identified 6 novel,
heterozygous missense mutations in 10. In 4 of the 10 families, the
mutation was an arg201-to-his (R201H) substitution (600937.0002). In 2
patients, the diabetes was familial. In 8 patients, the diabetes arose
from a spontaneous mutation (see, e.g., V59M; 600937.0003). When the
most common mutation, R201H, was coexpressed with SUR in Xenopus
oocytes, the ability of ATP to block mutant ATP-sensitive potassium
channels was greatly reduced. Thus, whereas inactivating mutations of
KCNJ11 lead to uncontrolled insulin secretion and congenital
hyperinsulinism, activating mutations cause neonatal diabetes. Gloyn et
al. (2004) concluded that heterozygous activating mutations of the
KCNJ11 gene are a common cause (approximately 34%) of permanent neonatal
diabetes. In a high proportion (80%) of subjects studied in their
series, the mutation occurred de novo.

Gloyn et al. (2005) identified 3 novel heterozygous mutations (see,
e.g., 600937.0017-600937.0018) in 3 of 11 probands with clinically
defined TNDM who did not have chromosome 6q24 abnormalities. The
mutations cosegregated with diabetes in 2 families and were not found in
100 controls. All 3 probands had insulin-treated diabetes diagnosed in
the first 4 months of life and went into remission by 7 to 17 months of
age. In transformed Xenopus oocytes, all 3 heterozygous mutations
resulted in a reduction in sensitivity to ATP when compared with
wildtype; however, the effect was less than that of PNDM-associated
mutations. Gloyn et al. (2005) concluded that mutations in KCNJ11 can
cause both remitting and permanent diabetes, suggesting that a fixed ion
channel abnormality may result in a fluctuating glycemic phenotype.

Yorifuji et al. (2005) found a missense mutation in the KCNJ11 gene
(600937.0012) in a 4-generation family with dominantly inherited
diabetes mellitus observed in 3 generations (see 610582). The onset and
severity of the diabetes were variable: transient neonatal diabetes,
childhood-onset diabetes, gestational diabetes, or adult-onset diabetes.

In a 20-year-old woman who had transient neonatal diabetes mellitus that
recurred at age 7 years, Colombo et al. (2005) identified heterozygosity
for a de novo R201H mutation in the KCNJ11 gene.

Proks et al. (2005) studied the MgATP sensitivity of KCNJ11-mutant
K(ATP) channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. In contrast to wildtype
channels, Mg(2+) dramatically reduced the ATP sensitivity of
heterozygous R201C (600937.0004), R201H, V59M, and V59G (600937.0005)
channels. This effect was predominantly mediated via the
nucleotide-binding domains of SUR1 (ABCC8; 600509) and resulted from an
enhanced stimulatory action of MgATP. Proks et al. (2005) concluded that
KCNJ11 mutations increase the current magnitude of heterozygous K(ATP)
channels by increasing MgATP activation and by decreasing ATP
inhibition. The fraction of unblocked K(ATP) current at physiologic
MgATP concentrations correlated with the severity of the clinical
phenotype.

- Association with Impaired Exercise Stress Response

Reyes et al. (2009) found that the E23K polymorphism was overrepresented
in individuals with dilated cardiomyopathy (see 115200) and congestive
heart failure (CHF) compared to controls, and that the KK genotype was
associated with abnormal cardiopulmonary exercise stress testing. Reyes
et al. (2009) suggested that E23K might represent a biomarker for
impaired stress performance.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

To determine why some mutations in the KCNJ11 gene cause PNDM in
isolation whereas others cause PNDM associated with marked developmental
delay, muscle weakness, and epilepsy, Proks et al. (2004) expressed
wildtype or mutant Kir6.2/sulfonylurea receptor-1 channels in Xenopus
oocytes. All of the mutations investigated (R201C, Q52R, and V59G)
increased resting whole-cell K(ATP) currents by reducing channel
inhibition by ATP, but in the simulated heterozygous state, the mutation
causing PNDM alone (R201C) produced smaller K(ATP) currents and less
change in ATP sensitivity than mutations associated with severe disease
(Q52R and V59G). These findings suggested that increased K(ATP) currents
hyperpolarize pancreatic beta cells and impair insulin secretion,
whereas larger K(ATP) currents are required to influence extra
pancreatic cell function. Proks et al. (2004) also found that mutations
causing PNDM alone impaired ATP sensitivity directly (at the binding
site), whereas those associated with severe disease acted indirectly by
biasing the channel conformation toward the open state. The effect of
the mutation on ATP sensitivity in the heterozygous state reflected the
different contributions of a single subunit in the Kir6.2 tetramer to
ATP inhibition and to the energy of the open state. The results showed
that mutations in the slide helix of Kir6.2 (V59G) influence the channel
kinetics, providing evidence that this domain is involved in Kir channel
gating and suggesting that the efficacy of sulfonylurea therapy in PNDM
may vary with genotype.

Massa et al. (2005) screened the KCNJ11 gene in 18 Italian patients with
what they termed 'permanent diabetes mellitus of infancy' (PDMI),
including 12 patients with onset within 3 months after birth and 6 with
onset between 3 months to 1 year of age. Five different heterozygous
mutations were identified in 8 patients with diabetes diagnosed between
day 3 and day 182. Two of these mutations were novel. Four of the 8
patients also had motor and/or developmental delay. Massa et al. (2005)
concluded that KCNJ11 mutations are a common cause of PNDM either in
isolation or associated with developmental delay.

The beta-cell ATP-sensitive potassium channel is a key component of
stimulus-secretion coupling in the pancreatic beta cell. The channel
couples metabolism to membrane electrical events, bringing about insulin
secretion. Given the critical role of this channel in glucose
homeostasis, it is not surprising that mutations in the genes encoding
the 2 essential subunits of the channel, KCNJ11 and ABCC8, can result in
either hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. Gloyn et al. (2006) reviewed the
loss-of-function mutations in KCNJ11 and ABCC8, which can cause
oversecretion of insulin and result in hyperinsulinemia of infancy. They
reviewed the management of patients in whom mutations in these genes are
found.

From a study of 49 patients with activating Kir6.2 mutations,
Slingerland and Hattersley (2006) concluded that these mutations cause a
severe reduction in fetal insulin secretion and hence fetal growth but
that this is independent of mutation severity. Postnatal catch-up
required insulin treatment but was complete, except in those with
epilepsy.

ANIMAL MODEL

Miki et al. (1997) generated transgenic mice expressing a
dominant-negative mutation within the conserved gly-tyr-gly motif of the
putative K(+)-permeable domain of Kcnj11. The gene was inserted
downstream of the human insulin promoter region for selective expression
in pancreatic beta cells. Transgenic mice developed hypoglycemia with
hyperinsulinemia as neonates and hyperglycemia with hypoinsulinemia and
decreased beta cell numbers as adults. Kcnj11 function was impaired in
the beta cells of transgenic mice with hyperglycemia, and both resting
membrane potential and basal calcium concentrations were significantly
elevated in transgenic mice. Miki et al. (1997) also observed a high
frequency of apoptotic beta cells prior to the development of
hyperglycemia, suggesting a role for Kcnj11 in cell survival as well as
in regulating insulin secretion.

Koster et al. (2000) generated transgenic mice expressing pancreatic
beta-cell K(ATP) channels with reduced ATP sensitivity. They used
transgenes with truncation of the N-terminal 30 amino acids of the
Kir6.2 subunit, and a double mutant with the 30-amino acid truncation
and a lys185-to-gln mutation. These transgenes were fused at the C
terminus with the green fluorescent protein to allow for detection under
ultraviolet illumination. Transgenic animals developed severe
hyperglycemia, hypoinsulinemia, and ketoacidosis within 2 days, and
typically died within 5 days. Nevertheless, islet morphology, insulin
localization, and alpha- and beta-cell distributions were normal (before
day 3), pointing to reduced insulin secretion as causal. The data
indicated that normal K(ATP) channel activity is critical for
maintenance of euglycemia and that overactivity can cause diabetes by
inhibiting insulin secretion.

In mice with a conditional deletion of Hnf4a (600281) in pancreatic beta
cells, Gupta et al. (2005) observed hyperinsulinemia in fasted and fed
animals but also impaired glucose tolerance. Islet perfusion and
calcium-imaging studies showed abnormal beta cell responses to
stimulation by glucose and sulfonylureas, explainable in part by a 60%
reduction in expression of the potassium channel subunit Kir6.2.
Cotransfection assays revealed that the Kir6.2 gene is a transcriptional
target of HNF4A. Gupta et al. (2005) concluded that HNF4A is required in
the pancreatic beta cell for regulation of the pathway of insulin
secretion dependent on the ATP-dependent potassium channel.

ATP-sensitive potassium channels are activated by various metabolic
stresses, including hypoxia. The substantia nigra pars reticulata, the
area with the highest expression of ATP-sensitive potassium channels in
the brain, plays a pivotal role in the control of seizures. Yamada et
al. (2001) studied mutant mice lacking the Kir6.2 subunit of
ATP-sensitive potassium channels and found that they were susceptible to
generalized seizures after brief hypoxia. In normal mice, the substantia
nigra pars reticulata neuron activity was inactivated during hypoxia by
the opening of the postsynaptic ATP-sensitive potassium channels,
whereas in knockout mice, the activity of these neurons was enhanced.
ATP-sensitive potassium channels exert a depressant effect on substantia
nigra pars reticulata neuronal activity during hypoxia and may be
involved in the nigral protection mechanism against generalized
seizures.

Girard et al. (2009) created a mouse strain conditionally expressing the
human Kir6.2 V59M mutation (600937.0003) specifically in pancreatic beta
cells. Kir6.2(V59M) mRNA was expressed at a level comparable to that of
endogenous wildtype Kir6.2 mRNA. Mutant mice (beta-V59M mice) developed
severe diabetes soon after birth, and by 5 weeks of age, blood glucose
levels were markedly increased and insulin was undetectable. Isolated
beta-V59M islets displayed a reduced percentage of beta cells, abnormal
morphology, abnormal calcium oscillations, lower insulin content, and
decreased expression of Kir6.2, Sur1, and insulin mRNA. Beta-V59M islets
secreted substantially less insulin and showed a smaller increase in
intracellular calcium in response to glucose than wildtype islets, which
was due to reduced sensitivity of Kir6.2(V69M) channels to ATP or
glucose. Current and secretion events downstream of channel closure
remained intact.

By using mice carrying the human V59M mutation in Kir6.2 (600937.0003)
targeted to either muscle or nerve, Clark et al. (2010) showed that
analogous motor impairments originate in the central nervous system
rather than in muscle or peripheral nerves. Clark et al. (2010) also
identified locomotor hyperactivity as a feature of K(ATP) channel
overactivity. Clark et al. (2010) concluded that their finding suggested
that drugs targeted against neuronal, rather than muscle, K(ATP)
channels are needed to treat the motor deficits and that such drugs
require high blood-brain barrier permeability.

In a male infant with profound hypoglycemia (601820), born of

homozygosity for a 649T-C mutation in the KCNJ11 gene, resulting in a

KCNJ11, ARG201HIS

In 4 unrelated patients with permanent neonatal diabetes (606176), Gloyn
et al. (2004) identified a heterozygous arg201-to-his (R201H) mutation
in the KCNJ11 gene. The arg201 residue lies close to the ATP-binding
site and was implicated in ATP sensitivity (Ribalet et al., 2003). In 1
family reported by Gloyn et al. (2004), 2 brothers and the father were
affected. Diabetes in the brothers was diagnosed under the age of 3 or 4
weeks, and in the father at the age of 12 weeks. The father was age 46
years at the time of report. In another family, mother and son were
affected. The diagnosis had been made at birth in the son and at age 6
weeks in the mother, who was 36 years old at the time of report. None of
the patients with the R201H mutation had muscle weakness, neurologic
abnormalities, or dysmorphic features. The arginine residue at position
201 of Kir6.2 lies close to the ATP-binding site and was previously
implicated in ATP sensing.

By functional expression studies in Xenopus oocytes, Proks et al. (2004)
found that mutations at the arg201 residue (see also R201C; 600937.0004)
caused a decrease in ATP sensitivity by altering the ATP-binding site.
However, the decreased sensitivity found in cells with a mutation at
arg201 was not as severe as that found in cells with a mutation at val59
(see V59M, 600937.0003 and V59G, 600937.0005).

Gloyn et al. (2006) reported 2 unrelated infants with PNDM and the R201H
mutation. The male infant also had dysmorphic facial features and
neurologic involvement, including seizures, developmental delay, and
axial hypotonia. In contrast, the other infant did not have neurologic
involvement, and her mother, who also carried the mutation, had severe
diabetes mellitus without neurologic involvement. The phenotypic
variability suggested that other modifying factors likely play a role.

In a 20-year-old woman with transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM3;
610582) in whom diabetes remitted at age 29 months and recurred at age 7
years, Colombo et al. (2005) identified heterozygosity for a de novo
602G-A (R201H) mutation in the KCNJ11 gene.

KCNJ11, VAL59MET

In 2 unrelated males with permanent neonatal diabetes (606176), Gloyn et
al. (2004) found heterozygosity for a val59-to-met (V59M) mutation in
the KCNJ11 gene. One of the patients had muscle weakness, and mildly
delayed motor and mental development.

Proks et al. (2004) noted that 2 mutations in the same residue of
Kir6.2, V59M and V59G (600937.0005), are associated with a more severe
form of PNDM that may be accompanied by developmental delay, muscle
weakness, and epilepsy, compared to PNDM caused by the mutations R201H
(600937.0002) and R201C (600937.0004). They found that residue val59
lies some distance from the ATP-binding site, within the N-terminal
region of the protein; moreover, val59 lies within the 'slide helix,' a
domain postulated to be involved in the opening and closing (gating) of
Kir channels. Functional expression studies in Xenopus oocytes indicated
that the V59M and V59G mutations decreased ATP sensitivity indirectly by
favoring the open conformation of the channel.

Massa et al. (2005) found the V59M mutation in 4 unrelated Italian
patients with PNDM. Two of the patients had motor and mental
developmental delay. One of the patients was diagnosed at over 6 months
of age (182 days). Massa et al. (2005) suggested that the designation
'permanent diabetes mellitus of infancy' (PDMI) replace 'permanent
neonatal diabetes mellitus.'

Gloyn et al. (2006) reported a patient with the V59M mutation who had
PNDM and neurologic features, including mild motor developmental delay
and axial hypotonia.

In a patient with PNDM (606176), Gloyn et al. (2004) identified a
heterozygous arg201-to-cys (R201C) mutation in the Kir6.2 gene. The
patient was diagnosed at 4 weeks of age and had no additional neurologic
or dysmorphic features. The arg201 residue lies close to the ATP-binding
site and was implicated in ATP sensitivity (Ribalet et al., 2003).

Proks et al. (2004) stated that the 2 mutations in residue arg201, R201H
(600937.0002) and R201C, which lie in the ATP-binding site of Kir6.2,
cause milder PNDM disease without neurologic features; however, Massa et
al. (2005) identified the R201C mutation in a patient with PNDM who also
had muscle weakness and delayed motor development.

Gloyn et al. (2004) described a family in which 2 affected paternal
half-sibs were heterozygous for the R201C mutation. Direct sequencing of
leukocyte DNA showed that their clinically unaffected mothers and father
were genotypically normal. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of the
father's leukocyte DNA detected no trace of mutant DNA. These results
were consistent with the father being mosaic for the mutation, which was
restricted to his germline. Gloyn et al. (2004) concluded that the high
percentage of permanent neonatal diabetes cases due to de novo KCNJ11
mutations (Gloyn et al., 2004) suggests that germline mosaicism may be
common.

In a male patient with permanent neonatal diabetes (606176), Gloyn et

the KCNJ11 gene. In addition to neonatal diabetes, the patient had
muscle weakness, marked motor and mental developmental delay, myoclonic
seizures with abnormal EEG, and dysmorphic features, including a
downturned mouth, bilateral ptosis, and contractures primarily in the

Proks et al. (2004) noted that 2 mutations in the same residue of
Kir6.2, V59M (600937.0003) and V59G, are associated with a more severe
form of PNDM that may be accompanied by developmental delay, muscle
weakness, and epilepsy, compared to PNDM caused by the mutations R201H
(600937.0002) and R201C (600937.0004). Proks et al. (2004) found that
residue val59 lies some distance from the ATP-binding site, within the
N-terminal region of the protein; moreover, val59 lies within the 'slide
helix,' a domain postulated to be involved in the opening and closing
(gating) of Kir channels. Functional expression studies in Xenopus
oocytes indicated that the V59M and V59G mutations decreased ATP
sensitivity indirectly by favoring the open conformation of the channel.

a 510G-C transversion in the KCNJ11 gene, resulting in a lys170-to-asn

HYPERINSULINEMIC HYPOGLYCEMIA, FAMILIAL, 2
KCNJ11, TYR12TER

In a Palestinian Arab boy with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (601820),
born of first-cousin parents, Nestorowicz et al. (1997) identified
homozygosity for a 39C-A transversion in the KCNJ11 gene, resulting in a
tyr12-to-ter (Y12X) substitution. The mutation is predicted to produce a
truncated Kir6.2 polypeptide lacking the putative K+ ion-selective pore
region as well as those domains proposed to confer the gating and inward
rectification properties of the molecule. In vitro studies in
transfected COS-1 cells confirmed the deleterious effect of the mutation
on channel activity. The authors noted that this patient was clinically
indistinguishable from patients with severe hyperinsulinism caused by
mutations in SUR1 (ABCC8; 600509; see HHF1, 600509).

KCNJ11, 88G-T, PROMOTER REGION

In an Israeli Bedouin infant with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia
(601820), Tornovsky et al. (2004) identified homozygosity for an 88G-T
transversion 5-prime of the transcription start site in the promoter
region of the KCNJ11 gene. Functional studies using a luciferase
reporter vector revealed a 44% decrease in reporter gene expression for
the mutant variant compared to wildtype.

In an Arab infant in whom a prenatal diagnosis of hyperinsulinism was
made due to a family history of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (601820),
Tornovsky et al. (2004) identified homozygosity for a C-T transition at
codon 254 in exon 1 of the KCNJ11 gene, resulting in a pro254-to-leu
(P254L) substitution. Photolabeling studies after transient transfection
into COSm6 cells revealed impaired trafficking of the mutant channel.

KCNJ11, CYS42ARG

In affected members of a 4-generation Japanese family with dominantly
inherited diabetes mellitus observed in 3 generations, Yorifuji et al.
(2005) detected a T-to-C transition at nucleotide 124 of the KCNJ11 gene
that gave rise to a cys42-to-arg amino acid substitution (C24R). The
proband had transient neonatal diabetes (TNDM3; 610582), and his
paternal grandfather had childhood diabetes. The others had adult-onset
diabetes without autoantibodies or insulin resistance. Patch-clamp
experiments using the mutated KCNJ11 showed that the mutation causes
increased spontaneous open probability and reduced ATP sensitivity. The
effect, however, was partially compensated by the reduction of
functional ATP-sensitive potassium channel expression at the cell
surface, which could account for the milder phenotype of the patients.
The authors concluded that these results broadened the spectrum of
diabetes phenotypes caused by mutations of KCNJ11 and suggested that
mutations in this gene should be taken into consideration for not only
permanent neonatal diabetes but also other forms of diabetes with milder
phenotypes and later onset.

HYPERINSULINEMIC HYPOGLYCEMIA, FAMILIAL, 2
KCNJ11, HIS259ARG

In a patient with severe congenital hyperinsulinism (601820), Marthinet
et al. (2005) identified a homozygous A-to-G transition at nucleotide
776 of the KCNJ11 gene that resulted in a his-259-to-arg substitution
(H259R). The patient presented with macrosomia at birth and severe
hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. Despite medical treatment, the newborn
continued to suffer from severe hypoglycemic episodes, and at 4 months
of age subtotal pancreatectomy was performed. Coexpression of KCNJ11
H259R with ABCC8 (600509) in HEK293T cells completely abolished K(ATP)
currents in electrophysiologic recordings. Double immunofluorescence
staining revealed that mutant KCNJ11 was partly retained in the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) causing decreased surface expression as
observed with total internal reflection fluorescence. Mutation of an
ER-retention signal partially rescued the trafficking defect without
restoring whole-cell currents.

KCNJ11, GLU23LYS

Hani et al. (1998) identified a glu23-to-lys (E23K) amino acid
substitution in the KCNJ11 gene by molecular screening using SSCP and
direct sequencing in 72 French Caucasian type II diabetic families. They
genotyped this variant in French cohorts of 191 unrelated type II
diabetic probands and 119 normoglycemic control subjects and performed
association studies. Homozygosity for lys23 (KK) was more frequent in
type II diabetic than in control subjects (27 vs 14%; p = 0.015).
Analyses in a recessive model (KK vs EK/EE) showed a stronger
association of the K allele with diabetes. In a metaanalysis of their
data for the E23K variant and data obtained from 3 other Caucasian
groups, Hani et al. (1998) found the E23K variant to be significantly
associated with type II diabetes.

Hansen et al. (2005) investigated the separate and combined effects of
the PPARG pro12-to-ala (P12A; 601487.0002) and the KCNJ11 E23K
polymorphisms on risk of type II diabetes. The combined analysis
involved 1,164 type II diabetic patients and 4,733 middle-aged,
glucose-tolerant subjects. In the separate analyses, the K allele of
KCNJ11 E23K associated with type II diabetes (odds ratio, 1.19; P =
0.0002), whereas PPARG P12A showed no significant association with type
2 diabetes. The combined analysis indicated that the 2 polymorphisms
acted in an additive manner to increase the risk of type II diabetes,
and the authors found no evidence for a synergistic interaction between
them. Together, the 2 polymorphisms conferred a population-attributable
risk for type II diabetes of 28%. The authors concluded that their
results showed no evidence of a synergistic interaction between the
KCNJ11 E23K and PPARG P12A polymorphisms, but indicated that they may
act in an additive manner to increase the risk of type II diabetes.

Laukkanen et al. (2004) found an additive effect of a high risk ABCC8
(600509) haplotype, composed of a silent polymorphism (AGG-AGA; arg1273
to arg) and 3 promoter polymorphisms, and the 23K allele of the KCNJ11
gene.

In genomewide association studies of type 2 diabetes involving genotype
data from a variety of international consortia, the Diabetes Genetics
Initiative of Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Lund University, and
Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (2007), Zeggini et al.
(2007), and Scott et al. (2007) confirmed association of the E23K
polymorphism (dbSNP rs5219) with diabetes susceptibility. Although this
association was not strongly observed in any single scan, all-data
metaanalyses resulted in genomewide significant association (OR = 1.14,
P = 6.7 x 10(-11)).

Association with Impaired Exercise Stress Response

Reyes et al. (2009) found that the E23K polymorphism was overrepresented
in 115 individuals with dilated cardiomyopathy (see 115200) and
congestive heart failure (CHF) compared to 2,031 community-based
controls (p less than 0.001). In addition, the KK genotype, which was
present in 18% of the CHF patients, was associated with abnormal
cardiopulmonary exercise stress testing: despite similar baseline heart
rates among genotype subgroups, individuals with the KK genotype had a
significantly reduced heart rate increase at matched workload, at 75% of
maximum oxygen consumption, and at peak VO(2), compared to those with
the EE or EK genotypes. Noting that the glu23 residue is located within
the functionally relevant intracellular slide helix region, Reyes et al.
(2009) suggested that E23K might represent a biomarker for impaired
stress performance.

KCNJ11, CYS166PHE

In an infant with a severe form of permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus
with neurologic features (606176), Gloyn et al. (2006) identified a
heterozygous G-to-T transversion in the KCNJ11 gene, resulting in a
cys166-to-phe (C166F) substitution. The infant had feeding problem from
birth and was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus at age 3 months. She also
had seizures with hypsarrhythmia, progressive neurologic deterioration,
diffuse hypotonia, and dysmorphic facial features. She died from
aspiration pneumonia at age 6 months. Gloyn et al. (2006) noted that the
C166F mutation is predicted to result in a channel with a marked
increase in open probability and reduced sensitivity to ATP, which would
severely alter the function of the channel in brain, muscle, and nerves,
in addition to pancreatic beta cells.

In an Italian boy with a severe form of permanent neonatal diabetes with
neurologic features (606176), Shimomura et al. (2007) identified a
heterozygous de novo 499A-C transversion in the KCNJ11 gene, resulting
in an ile167-to-leu (I167L) substitution at the cytoplasmic end of the
second transmembrane domain near the internal gate of the channel. In
vitro functional expression studies showed that the mutant I167L channel
had severely impaired sensitivity to ATP and markedly increased open
channel probability. Sulfonylurea treatment resulted in partial blockade
of current in the mutant channels, and the patient showed a good
response to sulfonylurea treatment, with both improved glycemic control
and neurologic improvement.

In a sister and brother with TNDM3 (610582), Gloyn et al. (2005)
identified a heterozygous G-to-A transition in the KCNJ11 gene,
resulting in a gly53-to-ser (G53S) substitution. The mutation was not
identified in 100 control individuals. Both children had insulin-treated
diabetes diagnosed in the first 3 weeks of life and went into remission
by age 20 months. The affected mother was positive for the mutation but
had a milder phenotype, having been diagnosed at age 4 years and
requiring only a low dose of insulin for glycemic control. In
transformed Xenopus oocytes, the G53S mutation resulted in a reduction
in sensitivity to ATP when compared with wildtype; however, the effect
was less than that of PNDM-associated mutations.

KCNJ11, GLY53ARG

In a male proband with TNDM3 (610582), Gloyn et al. (2005) identified a
heterozygous G-to-C transversion in the KCNJ11 gene, resulting in a
gly53-to-arg (G53R) substitution. The mutation was not identified in 100
control individuals. The proband had insulin-treated diabetes diagnosed
at age 16 weeks and went into remission by 17 months with relapse at age
28 months. The affected mother was positive for the mutation and was
diagnosed with diabetes at 11 weeks with no periods of remission. Both
mother and son had learning difficulties. In transformed Xenopus
oocytes, the G53R mutation resulted in a reduction in sensitivity to ATP
when compared with wildtype; however, the effect was less than that of
PNDM-associated mutations.

KCNJ11, GLY53ASP

Koster et al. (2008) reported a 27-year-old patient with intermediate
developmental delay, epilepsy, and neonatal diabetes (606176) in whom
sequencing revealed a heterozygous gly53-to-asp (G53D) mutation in the
KCNJ11 gene. Treatment was progressively transferred from insulin to the
inhibitory sulfonylureas (SUs) gliclazide and finally to glibenclamide.
The patient demonstrated improved glycemic control and motor
coordination with SU treatment, with glibenclamide more effective than
gliclazide. Reconstituted G53D channels exhibited reduced ATP
sensitivity, which was predicted to suppress electrical activity in
vivo. G53D channels coexpressed with the pancreatic and neuronal isoform
of the sulfonylurea receptor SUR1 (600509) exhibited high-affinity block
by gliclazide but were insensitive to block when coexpressed with the
skeletal muscle isoform SUR2A (601439). Koster et al. (2008) concluded
that SUs can resolve motor dysfunction in an adult with intermediate
DEND and that this improvement is due to inhibition of the neuronal but
not skeletal muscle ATP-sensitive potassium channel.

HYPERINSULINEMIC HYPOGLYCEMIA, FAMILIAL, 2
KCNJ11, GLU282LYS

In a Swedish patient with HHF2 (601820) with focal adenomatous
hyperplasia, Taneja et al. (2009) identified an 844G-A transition in the
KCNJ11 gene, resulting in a glu282-to-lys (E282K) substitution within a
diacidic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit signal DXE at codons 280 to
282. The paternal E282K mutation abrogated the exit signal and prevented
the ER export and surface expression of the channel. Since in focal
hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, the maternal chromosome containing the
K(ATP) channel genes are lost, beta-cells of the patient would lack
wildtype Kir6.2 to rescue the mutant Kir6.2 subunit expressed from the
paternal chromosome.

DIABETES MELLITUS, PERMANENT NEONATAL, WITH NEUROLOGIC FEATURES
KCNJ11, PHE60TYR

In a patient with neonatal diabetes, developmental delay, and epilepsy
(606176), Mannikko et al. (2010) identified heterozygosity for 2 novel
mutations on the same haplotype (cis), phe60 to tyr (F60Y) and val64 to
leu (V64L), in the slide helix of Kir6.2 (KCNJ11). Functional analysis
revealed that the F60Y mutation increased the intrinsic channel open
probability, thereby indirectly producing a marked decrease in channel
inhibition by ATP and an increase in whole-cell potassium-ATP currents.
When expressed alone, the V64L mutation caused a small reduction in
apparent ATP inhibition, by enhancing the ability of MgATP to stimulate
channel activity. The V64L mutation also ameliorated the deleterious
effects on the F60Y mutation when it was expressed on the same, but not
a different, subunit. The authors concluded that F60Y is the pathogenic
mutation and that interactions between slide helix residues may
influence KATP channel gating.

600339	TITLE *600339 HEPATOMA-DERIVED GROWTH FACTOR; HDGF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Nakamura et al. (1994) purified a novel hepatoma-derived growth factor
from the conditioned medium of human hepatoma-derived cell line HuH-7.
Molecular cloning of a cDNA from the cDNA library of the same cell line
was done on the basis of the N-terminal amino acid sequence. The cDNA
was 2.4 kb long and the deduced amino acid sequence contained 240 amino
acids without a signal peptide-like N-terminal hydrophobic sequence. The
primary sequence shared homology with the high mobility group-1 protein
(163905); they showed 23.4% amino acid identity and 35.6% amino acid
similarity.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunofluorescence study, Nakamura et al. (1994) showed that HDGF is
localized in the cytoplasm of hepatoma cells and northern blots showed
that it is expressed ubiquitously in normal tissues and tumor cell
lines. Nakamura et al. (1994) suggested that it is a novel
heparin-binding protein with mitogenic activity for fibroblasts.

MAPPING

By PCR screening of a commercial monochromosomal hybrid panel, Wanschura
et al. (1996) mapped HDGF to the X chromosome. By FISH, they refined the
localization to Xq25. Subsequently, however, the International Radiation
Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the HDGF gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP
SHGC-132090). Amberger (2007) refined the localization to 1q21 based on
an alignment of the HDGF sequence (GenBank GENBANK D16431) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.2).

176871	TITLE *176871 EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 2-ALPHA KINASE 2; EIF2AK2
;;PROTEIN KINASE, INTERFERON-INDUCIBLE DOUBLE-STRANDED RNA-ACTIVATED;
PRKR;;
PKR;;
p68 KINASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

EIF2AK2 is a protein serine/threonine kinase that acquires enzymatic
activity following autophosphorylation, a process mediated by
double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Activation of EIF2AK2 allows the kinase to
phosphorylate its natural substrate, the alpha subunit of eukaryotic
protein synthesis initiation factor-2 (EIF2-alpha; 603907), leading to
the inhibition of protein synthesis (summary by Kuhen et al., 1996).

CLONING

Meurs et al. (1990) cloned EIF2AK2, which encodes a 550-amino acid
protein with a predicted molecular mass of 62 kD. Immunoblot assay of
interferon-treated human Daudi and murine L929 cells identified a 68-kD
protein in human cells and a 65-kD protein in mouse cells. Transcription
of EIF2AK2 was induced following exposure to interferon (IFNG; 147570)
in a dose-dependent manner and was not affected by inhibition of protein
synthesis.

Kuhen et al. (1996) isolated the EIF2AK2 gene, which they called PKR, as
lambda phage and P1 phage clones from a human genomic library, and
compared the structural organization of the mouse and human genes. The
human and mouse proteins shared approximately 60% amino acid identity.
Kuhen et al. (1996) determined the nucleotide sequence of the human
EIF2AK2 gene, which encodes a 551-amino acid protein.

Jeon et al. (2012) reported that PKR contains 2 N-terminal dsRNA-
binding motifs and a long C-terminal kinase domain.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kuhen et al. (1996) determined that the EIF2AK2 gene contains 17 exons
and spans approximately 50 kb.

MAPPING

Barber et al. (1993) mapped the EIF2AK2 gene to chromosome 2p21 by in
situ hybridization. The corresponding mouse gene was mapped to
chromosome 17 (band E2) by the same method. By FISH analysis, Squire et
al. (1993) assigned the EIF2AK2 gene to the boundary between chromosome
2p22-p21.

GENE FUNCTION

Ben-Asouli et al. (2002) showed that human gamma-interferon mRNA uses
local activation of PKR in the cell to control its own translation
yield. IFNG mRNA was found to activate PKR through a pseudoknot in its
5-prime untranslated region. Mutations that impaired pseudoknot
stability reduced the ability to activate PKR and strongly increased the
translation efficiency of IFNG mRNA. Nonphosphorylatable mutant
eIF2-alpha (eIF2A; 609234), knockout of PKR, and the PKR inhibitors
2-aminopurine, transdominant-negative PKR, or vaccinia E3L
correspondingly enhanced translation of IFNG mRNA. The potential to form
the pseudoknot was found to be phylogenetically conserved. Ben-Asouli et
al. (2002) proposed that the RNA pseudoknot acts to adjust translation
of IFNG mRNA to the PKR level expressed in the cell.

Taylor et al. (1999) studied the mechanism underlying the resistance of
hepatitis C virus (HCV) to interferon. They demonstrated that the HCV
envelope protein E2 contains a sequence identical with phosphorylation
sites of the interferon-inducible protein kinase PKR and the translation
initiation factor EIF2-alpha, a target of PKR. E2 inhibited the kinase
activity of PKR and blocked its inhibitory effect on protein synthesis
and cell growth. This interaction of E2 in PKR may be one mechanism by
which HCV circumvents the antiviral effect of interferon. Taylor et al.
(1999) hypothesized that another potential outcome of PKR inhibition is
the promotion of cell growth which may contribute to HCV-associated
hepatocellular carcinoma.

Huntington disease (143100) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a
trinucleotide repeat expansion within the huntingtin gene (613004),
resulting in generation of a polyglutamine tract in the protein product.
Peel et al. (2001) showed that PKR preferentially bound mutant
huntingtin RNA transcripts immobilized on streptavidin columns that had
been incubated with human brain extracts. Immunohistochemical studies
demonstrated that PKR was present in its activated form in both human
Huntington autopsy material and brain tissue derived from Huntington
yeast artificial chromosome transgenic mice. The increased
immunolocalization of the activated kinase was more pronounced in areas
most affected by the disease. The authors suggested a role for PKR
activation in the Huntington disease process.

Gale et al. (1998) showed that P58(IPK) (601184) is inhibited through a
direct interaction with P52(rIPK) (607374), which in turn results in
upregulation of PKR activity. Gale et al. (1998) concluded that their
data described a protein kinase-regulatory system that encompasses an
intersection of interferon-, stress-, and growth-regulatory pathways.

PKR, which is involved in TLR signaling and mediates apoptosis in
fibroblasts in response to viral infection and inflammatory cytokines,
also activates IKK (see 600664) and NFKB (see 164011), thereby
suppressing apoptosis. To determine the role of PKR in macrophage
apoptosis, Hsu et al. (2004) examined its regulation and found that both
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and poly(IC) activate PKR dependent on the
presence of TRIF (607601). Macrophages lacking PKR had normal activation
of p38 (MAPK14; 600289) and IKK as well as other NFKB target genes in
response to LPS, but exhibited defective STAT1 (600555) phosphorylation
and failed to undergo apoptosis, independent of the presence of IFNB
(147640). They observed that apoptosis induced by live pathogenic
gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria required both TLR4 (603030) and
PKR, possibly representing a major mechanism for pathogenic bacteria
that use specific virulence factors to avoid detection and destruction
by the innate immune system. Hsu et al. (2004) proposed that TLR4
activates PKR and triggers apoptosis through TRIF and TRAM (608321)
adaptor proteins and that inhibition of PKR may augment
macrophage-mediated antibacterial responses.

Zhang et al. (2004) used immunoprecipitation and reconstituted kinase
assays to show that the FANCC (227645), FANCA (607139), and FANCG
(602956) proteins functionally interacted with and inhibited PKR in bone
marrow cells. PKR showed strongest binding to the FANCC protein. PKR
activity was increased in bone marrow cells of patients with Fanconi
anemia (FA; 227650) with mutations in the FANCC, FANCA, or FANCG genes.
All 3 of these cell lines showed significant increases in PKR bound to
the FANCC protein, which correlated with increased PKR activation. The
cells also showed hypersensitivity to growth repression mediated by
IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha (191160). Forced expression of a patient-derived
FANCC mutation increased PKR activation and cell death. Zhang et al.
(2004) concluded that FA mutations cause increased binding of PKR to
FANCC and increased PKR activation, leading to growth inhibition of
hematopoietic progenitors and bone marrow failure in Fanconi anemia.

Nallagatla et al. (2007) reported that RNAs with very limited secondary
structures activate PKR in a 5-prime-triphosphate-dependent fashion in
vitro and in vivo. Activation of PKR by 5-prime-triphosphate RNA is
independent of RIG1 (ROBO3; 608630) and is enhanced by treatment with
type I interferon (IFNA; 147660). Surveillance of molecular features at
the 5-prime end of transcripts by PKR presents a means of allowing
pathogenic RNA to be distinguished from self-RNA. Nallagatla et al.
(2007) concluded that this form of RNA-based discrimination may be a
critical step in mounting an early immune response.

To be effective, PKR must recognize a conserved substrate (eIF2A;
609234) while avoiding rapidly evolving substrate mimics such as the
poxvirus-encoded K3L. Using the PKR-K3L system and a combination of
phylogenetic and functional analyses, Elde et al. (2009) uncovered
evolutionary strategies by which host proteins can overcome viral
mimicry. Elde et al. (2009) found that PKR has evolved under intense
episodes of positive selection in primates. The ability of PKR to evade
viral mimics is partly due to positive selection at sites most
intimately involved in eIF2A recognition. They also found that adaptive
changes on multiple surfaces of PKR produce combinations of
substitutions that increase the odds of defeating mimicry. Elde et al.
(2009) concluded that, although it can seem that pathogens gain
insurmountable advantages by mimicking cellular components, host factors
such as PKR can compete in molecular 'arms races' with mimics because of
evolutionary flexibility at protein interaction interfaces challenged by
mimicry.

Using HCT116 human colon carcinoma cells and mouse embryo fibroblasts,
Yoon et al. (2009) found PKR mRNA and protein were upregulated by p53
(TP53; 191170) and by genotoxic stress, which induces p53 expression.
Deletion analysis and DNase footprinting revealed 2 half-sites for p53
binding within the PKR promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays,
chromatin immunoprecipitation, and reporter gene assays revealed direct
p53 binding to these sites, with activation of the PKR promoter. Binding
and activation of PKR by p53 was independent of interferon binding. In
response to genotoxic stress, cytoplasmic PKR was largely phosphorylated
and was associated with the phosphorylation and activation of
EIF2-alpha. Knockdown of either p53 or PKR abrogated all cellular
effects of genotoxic stress. PKR also played a role in p53-mediated
inhibition of translation, G2 arrest, and apoptosis following DNA
damage. Furthermore, knockdown of PKR in HCT116 cells and derived tumors
provided resistance to anticancer agents. Yoon et al. (2009) concluded
that PKR has a role in p53-mediated cellular responses to genotoxic
stress.

By studying HMGB1 (163905) release mechanisms, Lu et al. (2012)
identified a role for PKR in inflammasome activation. Exposure of
macrophages to inflammasome agonists induced PKR autophosphorylation.
PKR inactivation by genetic deletion or pharmacologic inhibition
severely impaired inflammasome activation in response to double-stranded
RNA, ATP, monosodium urate, adjuvant aluminum, rotenone, live E. coli,
anthrax lethal toxin, DNA transfection, and S. typhimurium infection.
PKR deficiency significantly inhibited the secretion of IL1-beta
(147720), IL18 (600953), and HMGB1 in E. coli-induced peritonitis. PKR
physically interacts with several inflammasome components, including
NLRP3 (606416), NLRP1 (606636), NLRC4 (606831), and AIM2 (604578), and
broadly regulates inflammasome activation. PKR autophosphorylation in a
cell-free system with recombinant NLRP3, ASC (PYCARD; 606838), and
pro-caspase-1 (147678) reconstituted inflammasome activity. Lu et al.
(2012) concluded that their results showed a crucial role for PKR in
inflammasome activation, and indicated that it should be possible to
pharmacologically target this molecule to treat inflammation.

Lee et al. (2011) found that the long noncoding RNA VTRNA2-1 (614938),
which they called pre-MIR886, directly bound to PKR in human cell lines
and inhibited its autoactivation. VTRNA2-1 was downregulated and PKR was
activated in a significant number of diverse cancer cell lines.
Knockdown of VTRNA2-1 resulted in PKR activation and PKR-dependent
phosphorylation of EIF2-alpha. PKR activation also independently induced
the NF-kappa-B pathway.

Kunkeaw et al. (2012) confirmed that VTRNA2-1, which they called NC886,
was a direct inhibitor of PKR. Knockdown of NC886 in nontransformed
cholangiocyte cells consistently activated the canonical PKR-EIF2-alpha
cell death pathway. However, in cholangiocarcinoma cells that either
lacked endogenous NC886 expression or in which NC886 expression was
knocked down, PKR activation frequently induced the NF-kappa-B cell
survival pathway. Kunkeaw et al. (2012) concluded that the effects of
NC886 downregulation or PKR activation depend on cellular context.

Jeon et al. (2012) found that a central region of NC886 stably
interacted with the 2 N-terminal dsRNA-binding motifs of PKR, with much
weaker binding to each motif individually. PKR bound preferentially to
NC886 in its slow-migrating conformation when the PKR-binding sequence
was single-stranded and sensitive to RNase digestion, but not when it
assumed a 4-nucleotide duplex structure. NC886 reciprocally competed
with double-stranded poly(I:C) for PKR binding. Because NC886 does not
show an extensive duplex region, Jeon et al. (2012) predicted that NC886
and dsRNAs bind PKR via different mechanisms. They hypothesized that
NC886 provides a threshold for PKR activation so that it occurs during
genuine viral infection and not in response to basal levels of cellular
dsRNA.
