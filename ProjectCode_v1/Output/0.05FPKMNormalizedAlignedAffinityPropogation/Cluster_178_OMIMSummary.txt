;;CLCKB
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The CLCNKA and CLCNKB channels are members of the ClC family, which
comprises at least 9 mammalian chloride channels. Each is believed to
have 12 transmembrane domains and intracellular N and C termini. The
prototype of the family in Torpedo is gated by both voltage and chloride
(Jentsch and Gunther, 1997).

CLONING

Kieferle et al. (1994) cloned rat and human homologs of 2 closely
related chloride channels found specifically in mammalian kidney, which
they called ClCK1 and ClCK2. In the rat, ClCK1 and ClCK2 appear to be
expressed along the nephron from the thin ascending limb of the Henle
loop onwards. The human homologs of these 2 genes, CLCNKA (602024) and
CLCNKB, encode proteins of 687 amino acids (Saito-Ohara et al., 1996).

GENE STRUCTURE

Simon et al. (1997) demonstrated that the intron-exon organization of
the CLCNKA and CLCNKB genes was identical, with each channel encoded by
19 exons. Overall, the genes show 94% DNA sequence identity in exons.
The 2 genes are transcribed from the same DNA strand, with CLCNKA
5-prime of CLCNKB. The 2 genes are separated by 11 kb of genomic DNA.

MAPPING

Saito-Ohara et al. (1996) mapped the CLCNKA and CLCNKB genes to
chromosome 1p36.

Considering CLCNKA and CLCNKB as candidate genes in families with
Bartter syndrome (607364), Simon et al. (1997) isolated PAC and cosmid
genomic clones encoding these genes. They found that both genes were
present in all 6 PAC clones, indicating that they are closely linked to
one another, as previously suggested by in situ hybridization using CLCK
cDNA (Saito-Ohara et al., 1996). Using a marker polymorphism in exon 13
of the CLCNKA gene, Simon et al. (1997) showed that in CEPH kindreds the
gene is linked to chromosome 1; a multipoint lod score of 15.8 at a
recombination fraction of 0.0 was obtained with D1S436.

GENE FUNCTION

Estevez et al. (2001) demonstrated that barttin (BSND; 606412) acts as
an essential beta subunit for CLCNKA and CLCNKB chloride channels, with
which it colocalizes in basolateral membranes of renal tubules and of
potassium-secreting epithelia of the inner ear. Disease-causing
mutations in either CLCNKB or barttin compromise currents through
heteromeric channels. Currents can be stimulated further by mutating a
proline-tyrosine (PY) motif on barttin. Estevez et al. (2001) concluded
that their work described the first known beta subunit for CLC chloride
channels and revealed that heteromers formed by chloride channels and
barttin are crucial for renal salt reabsorption and potassium recycling
in the inner ear.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Bartter Syndrome Type 3

In affected members of 10 kindreds with Bartter syndrome type 3
(607364), Simon et al. (1997) found homozygous deletion of the CLCNKB
gene. Two kindreds showed homozygous loss of part of CLCNKB. The tight
linkage and topology of CLCNKA and CLCNKB raised the question of unequal
crossing over between these genes or blocks of homologous flanking
sequences as a mechanism for deletion of CLCNKB sequences. Simon et al.
(1997) found reciprocal loss of CLCNKA and CLCNKB sequences consistent
with this mechanism. They also demonstrated 7 mutations altering the
CLCNKB gene and cosegregating with the disease (e.g., 602023.0001). In 4
kindreds, affected persons were homozygous for identified mutations, 2
index cases were compound heterozygotes, and a single mutation was
identified in 1 kindred.

Jeck et al. (2000) described 3 unrelated patients presenting with the
typical laboratory findings of Gitelman syndrome (263800). Mutation
analysis in these 3 patients revealed no abnormality in the SLC12A3
(600968) gene. Instead, all patients were found to carry previously
described mutations in the CLCNKB gene: 2 were homozygous for complete
deletion of the gene (602023.0006) and 1 was homozygous for an A-G
substitution at the splice acceptor site of intron 7 (602023.0007)
(Konrad et al., 2000). Further clinical investigation revealed features
more typical of Bartter syndrome than of Gitelman syndrome. Jeck et al.
(2000) suggested that the phenotypic overlap may indicate a physiologic
cooperation of the apical thiazide-sensitive NaCl cotransporter
(SLC12A3) and the basolateral chloride channel (CLCNKB) for salt
reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule.

Schurman et al. (2001) studied 5 African American children with Bartter
syndrome. Like the African American children reported by Simon et al.
(1997), these children demonstrated homozygous deletion of the CLCNKB
gene (602023.0006). They had partial correction of hypokalemia, normal
calciotropic activity, suboptimal growth despite therapy, and abnormal
renal ultrasounds but no nephrocalcinosis.

Fukuyama et al. (2004) reported 2 Japanese patients who suffered from
clinically diagnosed classic Bartter syndrome but who had hypocalciuria.
Hypocalciuria is believed to be a pathognomic finding of Na-Cl
cotransporter malfunction. They identified mutations in the CLCNKB gene,
including a premature termination mutation (602023.0009) and a splice
site mutation (602023.0010). The authors concluded that some CLCNKB
mutations may affect calcium handling in renal tubular cells.

- Bartter Syndrome Type 4B

In a child with renal salt wasting and deafness (Bartter syndrome type
4B; 613090) who had no mutation in the BSND gene (606412), Schlingmann
et al. (2004) identified both a homozygous deletion of the CLCNKB gene
(602023.0008) and a homozygous trp80-to-cys mutation in the CLCNKA gene
(W80C; 602024.0001). Because this combined impairment of the CLCNKA and
CLCNKB genes resulted in a phenotype mimicking the form of infantile
Bartter syndrome with sensorineural deafness caused by mutation in the
BSND gene (Bartter syndrome type 4A; 602522), Schlingmann et al. (2004)
concluded that this case with digenic inheritance supported the notion
that the CLCNK-type channels are regulated by barttin and offered strong
evidence of genetic heterogeneity in patients who have both severe renal
salt wasting and deafness.

Nozu et al. (2008) reported a 2-year-old Japanese girl with a severe
form of Bartter syndrome with sensorineural deafness who was born of
nonconsanguineous parents. Genetic analysis showed 2 heterozygous
mutations in the CLCNKA (602024.0002) and CLCNKB (602023.0011) genes on
the paternal allele, and a 12-kb deletion involving portions of the
CLCNKA and CLCNKB genes on the maternal allele. Neither parent was
clinically affected. The findings indicated clear digenic inheritance in
this patient and confirmed that loss of function of all 4 alleles of the
CLCNKA and CLCNKB genes can result in Bartter syndrome type 4B.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
BARTTER SYNDROME, TYPE 3
CLCNKB, PRO124LEU

In 2 apparently unrelated Turkish kindreds, Simon et al. (1997) found
that children with Bartter syndrome type 3 (607364) were homozygous for
the identical mutation, a substitution of leucine for proline at codon
124 of the CLCNKB gene. This proline residue is conserved among all
mammalian members of the CLC family.

.0002
BARTTER SYNDROME, TYPE 3
CLCNKB, ALA204THR

In 2 Spanish kindreds, Simon et al. (1997) found that individuals with
Bartter syndrome type 3 (607364) were homozygous for substitution of
threonine for alanine at codon 204 in the fifth transmembrane domain of
the CLCNKB gene. All CLC channel members, including the CLC-related
channel of yeast, have alanine or glycine at this position, within a
highly conserved hydrophobic segment (amino acids AAAA or AGAA).

.0003
BARTTER SYNDROME, TYPE 3
CLCNKB, ARG438CYS

One of the missense mutations in the CLCNKB gene identified by Simon et
al. (1997) in Bartter syndrome type 3 (607364) patients was arg438 to
cys (R438C), where R438 is conserved among all members of the CLC
family.

.0004
BARTTER SYNDROME, TYPE 3
CLCNKB, ALA349ASP

One of the missense mutations identified by Simon et al. (1997) in the
CLCNKB gene in patients with Bartter syndrome type 3 (607364) was ala349
to asp (A349D), which introduces a charged residue in the predicted
eighth transmembrane domain of the channel.

.0005
BARTTER SYNDROME, TYPE 3
CLCNKB, TYR432HIS

One of the mutations identified by Simon et al. (1997) in the CLCNKB
gene in Bartter syndrome type 3 (607364) patients was a tyr432-to-his
(Y432H) substitution.

.0006
BARTTER SYNDROME, TYPE 3
CLCNKB, DEL

In 3 patients, the offspring of consanguineous parents, presenting with
biochemical findings consistent with the diagnosis of Gitelman syndrome
(263800), Jeck et al. (2000) detected 2 mutations previously described
by Konrad et al. (2000): homozygous deletion of the CLCNKB gene was
present in 2 patients, and homozygous exchange of guanine for adenine at
the consensus acceptor site of intron 7 (602023.0007) was present in the
third. Review of medical history revealed early onset of the disease,
within the first year of life. Clinical presentation included episodes
of dehydration, weakness, and failure to thrive, much more suggestive of
classic Bartter syndrome (607364) than of Gitelman syndrome. The
coexistence of hypomagnesemia and hypocalciuria was not present from the
beginning. In the follow-up, a drop of both parameters below normal
range was a consistent finding reflecting a transition from classic
Bartter syndrome to Gitelman syndrome phenotype. Jeck et al. (2000)
suggested that the phenotypic overlap may indicate a physiologic
cooperation of the apical thiazide-sensitive NaCl cotransporter and the
basolateral chloride channel for salt reabsorption in the distal
convoluted tubule.

See 602023.0006 and Jeck et al. (2000).

.0008
BARTTER SYNDROME, TYPE 4B
CLCNKB, DEL

In a child with renal salt wasting and deafness (Bartter syndrome type
4B; 613090) who had no mutation in the BSND gene (606412), Schlingmann
et al. (2004) identified both a homozygous deletion of the CLCNKB gene
and a homozygous cys80-to-trp (C80W) mutation in the CLCNKA gene (C80W;
602024.0001). The patient was born prematurely to consanguineous
parents, and the pregnancy was complicated by severe maternal
polyhydramnios during the last 6 weeks of gestation.

.0009
BARTTER SYNDROME, TYPE 3, WITH HYPOCALCIURIA
CLCNKB, TRP610TER

In 2 Japanese patients who had been diagnosed with classic Bartter
syndrome (607364) but who presented with hypocalciuria, Fukuyama et al.
(2004) found a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 1830 in exon 16 of the
CLCNKB gene that resulted in premature termination (trp610 to ter;
W610X).

.0010
BARTTER SYNDROME, TYPE 3, WITH HYPOCALCIURIA
CLCNKB, IVS2AS, G-C, -1

In a Japanese patient who had been diagnosed with classic Bartter
syndrome (607364) but who presented with hypocalciuria, Fukuyama et al.
(2004) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the CLCNKB
gene. One was a G-to-C transversion at the 3-prime splice site of intron
2; the other was a premature termination mutation (W610X; 602023.0009).

.0011
BARTTER SYNDROME, TYPE 4B
CLCNKB, IVS17DS, G-A, +1

In a 2-year-old Japanese girl with a severe form of Bartter syndrome
with sensorineural deafness (613090), Nozu et al. (2008) identified a
heterozygous G-to-A transition in intron 7 of the CLCNKB gene, resulting
in a splice site mutation, and a heterozygous mutation in the CLCNKA
gene (Q260X; 602024.0002), both inherited from the father. The maternal
allele had a 12-kb deletion including portions of both CLCNKA and
CLCNKB. Neither parent was clinically affected. The findings indicated
clear digenic inheritance in this patient and confirmed that loss of
function of all 4 alleles of the CLCNKA and CLCNKB genes can result in
Bartter syndrome type 4B.
