ERBA-RELATED 2; EAR2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Miyajima et al. (1988) identified in the human genome 2 ERBA-related
genes, named EAR2 and EAR3 (132890), and characterized them by cDNA
cloning. The genes are predicted to encode proteins very similar in
primary structure to receptors for steroid hormones and thyroid hormone.
In addition, the amino acid sequences of the 2 gene products are very
similar to each other, especially in the DNA-binding domain (86%
homology) and at the putative ligand-binding domain (76% homology).
Northern hybridization using EAR DNA probes with RNAs from various
tissues of the human fetus showed that the expression of EAR2 is high in
the liver, whereas the expression of EAR3 is relatively ubiquitous.

MAPPING

By hybridization analysis of DNAs from sorted chromosomes, Miyajima et
al. (1988) showed that the EAR2 gene is located on chromosome 19 and the
EAR3 gene on chromosome 5.

Bahler et al. (1997) performed cosmid contig mapping indicating that the
NR2F6 gene was 100 kb proximal to MYO9B (602129) on chromosome 19p13.1.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 1-hybrid screen and in vitro assays of recombinant mouse Ear2,
Liu et al. (2003) determined that Ear2 specifically binds the TGACCT
direct-repeat motif. Overexpression of Ear2 in mouse kidney tumor cells
showed that Ear2 potently decreased both baseline and retinoid-induced
mouse renin promoter activity in a dose-dependent, enhancer-dependent,
and sequence-specific manner. Mutations in Ear2, which abolished binding
to the TGACCT motif, also abolished transcriptional repression.

By in silico and biochemical analyses, Hermann-Kleiter et al. (2008)
identified ser83 on NR2F6 as a substrate for protein kinase C (PKC; see
176960). NR2F6 potently antagonized the ability of mouse Th0 and Th17
cells to induce expression of cytokines, including Il2 (147680) and Il17
(IL17A; 603149). NR2F6 interfered with DNA binding by the NFAT (see
600490)/AP1 (165160) complex, but not NF-kappa-B (see 164011) and,
subsequently, transcriptional activity of the NFAT-dependent IL17A
promoter. Based on these findings and findings in Nr2f6 -/- mice (see
ANIMAL MODEL), Hermann-Kleiter et al. (2008) concluded that NR2F6 is a
transcriptional repressor of IL17 expression in Th17-differentiated
CD4-positive T cells in vitro and in vivo.

ANIMAL MODEL

Warnecke et al. (2005) found that Nr2f6-null mice were born at expected
mendelian ratios, but they showed defects in development of the locus
ceruleus (LC). Examination of the genes expressed in the LC of
Nr2f6-null mice suggested that Nr2f6 resides in a signaling cascade
leading to LC development that operates in the order Mash1 (ASCL1;
100790)--Nr2f6--Phox2b (603851)--Phox2a (ARIX; 602753). More than 70% of
LC neurons were absent in Nr2f6-null adults, with agenesis affecting
primarily the dorsal division of the LC, which normally projects
noradrenergic efferents to the cortex. In agreement with this, the
cortical concentration of noradrenalin was reduced 4-fold in mutant
mice. The defects in the LC of mutant mice were also associated with
defects in circadian behaviors and circadian gene expression. Warnecke
et al. (2005) concluded that NR2F6 is required early in the development
of the LC. They proposed that neurons in the dorsal division of the LC
contribute to the regulation of the forebrain clock, at least in part,
through targeted release of noradrenalin into the cortical area.

Hermann-Kleiter et al. (2008) found that mice lacking Nr2f6 had
hyperactive lymphocytes, developed late-onset immunopathology, and were
hypersusceptible to Th17-dependent experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis.

603466	TITLE *603466 EMBRYONIC LETHAL, ABNORMAL VISION, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG-LIKE 1; ELAVL1
;;HU-ANTIGEN R; HuR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cis-acting AU-rich elements (AREs) destabilize mRNAs and play an
important role in the control of gene expression. Members of the ELAVL
protein family, such as ELAVL1, contain 3 RNA-binding domains and bind
to AREs (Ma et al., 1996).

CLONING

By RT-PCR of HeLa cell mRNA using primers based on a conserved region of
HuD (ELAVL4; 168360), Ma et al. (1996) isolated a partial cDNA encoding
ELAVL1, which they designated HuR. They recovered additional cDNAs
corresponding to the entire coding region and determined that the
predicted HuR protein contains 326 amino acids. Like other ELAVL
proteins, HuR has a short N-terminal region followed by 2 RNA-binding
motifs, a basic linker domain, and a third RNA-binding motif. RT-PCR
analysis indicated that HuR was expressed ubiquitously, in contrast to
the neural-specific expression of ELAVL2 (601673), ELAVL3 (603458), and
ELAVL4.

GENE FUNCTION

Ma et al. (1996) found that recombinant HuR protein bound to AREs in
both cytokine and oncogene mRNAs with high specificity and affinity.

Li et al. (2002) found that mammalian Carm1 (603934) associated with HuR
and activated HuR via methylation in vitro and in vivo. Carm1 methylated
HuR predominantly on arg217 in the hinge region between the second and
third recognition motif domains. HuR methylation increased in cells that
overexpressed Carm1, and lipopolysaccharide stimulation of mouse
macrophages caused increased methylation of endogenous HuR, leading to
the stabilization of TNF-alpha (TNF; 191160) mRNA.

Bhattacharyya et al. (2006) found that endogenous cationic amino acid
transporter-1 (CAT1, or SLC7A1; 104615) mRNA was translationally
repressed by miR122 (MIR122A; 609582) in Huh7 human hepatoma cells. CAT1
mRNA and reporters bearing its 3-prime UTR could be relieved from
miR122-mediated repression by subjecting Huh7 cells to different stress
conditions. This derepression was accompanied by release of CAT1 mRNA
from cytoplasmic processing bodies and its entry into polysomes, and
this process involved binding of HuR to the 3-prime UTR of CAT1.

Abdelmohsen et al. (2007) showed that the 3-prime UTR of SIRT1 (604479)
transcripts contains AREs with HuR binding motifs. They found that HuR
associated with SIRT1 mRNA and enhanced its stability. In human diploid
fibroblasts, they found a concomitant reduction in both HuR and SIRT1
during replicative senescence. Oxidative stress lowered SIRT1 mRNA and
protein levels, caused the dissociation of HuR from SIRT1 mRNA, and
reduced the stability of SIRT1 mRNA in an HuR-dependent manner. The
oxidant-activated cell cycle checkpoint kinase CHK2 (CHEK2; 604373)
phosphorylated HuR and altered its binding to SIRT1 and other HuR target
mRNAs.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Ma and Furneaux (1997) mapped the
HuR gene to 19p13.2.

ANIMAL MODEL

Katsanou et al. (2005) studied the role of HuR in inflammatory responses
using a transgenic murine system in which overexpression of HuR was
restricted to the myeloid lineage and was quantitatively regulated with
tetracycline analogs. They found that HuR suppressed biosynthesis of
specific inflammatory mediators (e.g., TNF; 191160) in synergy with
negative posttranscriptional modulators such as TIA1 (603518). Katsanou
et al. (2005) proposed that the HuR/TIA1 cooperation results in the
formation of an 'inert' reservoir of mRNAs that may subsequently become
labile for degradation by tristetraprolin (ZFP36; 190700).

Chi et al. (2011) stated that knockout of Hur in mice is embryonic
lethal due to defective placental branching. They targeted Hur deletion
to primordial germ cells and found that Hur deletion resulted in male,
but not female, infertility. Histologic examination of Hur -/- testis
revealed vacuolization of seminiferous tubules, extensive cell death
during meiotic divisions, and failure of spermatid elongation.
Overexpression of Hur also caused failure of spermatid elongation. Both
deletion and overexpression of Hur led to downregulation and
mislocalization of Hspa2 (140560), a critical regulator of
spermatogenesis. RNA immunoprecipitation analysis of wildtype testis
suggested that Hur bound Hspa2 mRNA. Chi et al. (2011) concluded that
HUR is not essential for progenitor germ cell survival, but that it is
required for completion of meiosis. They proposed that HUR may direct
HSPA2 mRNA to polysomes and control HSPA2 expression at the
translational level.

606031	TITLE *606031 WD REPEAT-CONTAINING PROTEIN 6; WDR6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

A conserved core of 4 or more modular repeat units defines a group of
functionally diverse regulatory proteins in eukaryotes known as the WD
repeat family. WD repeats are minimally conserved regions of
approximately 40 amino acids typically bracketed by gly-his and trp-asp
(GH-WD), which may facilitate formation of heterotrimeric or
multiprotein complexes. Proteins belonging to the WD repeat family are
involved in a variety of cellular processes, including cell cycle
progression, signal transduction, apoptosis, and gene regulation
(summary by Claudio et al., 1999).

CLONING

Using a cDNA fragment obtained with a differential display/PCR technique
to screen a human atrial cDNA library, Li et al. (2000) obtained a novel
WD repeat-containing cDNA, designated WDR6. WDR6 encodes a 1,121-amino
acid protein with 11 WD repeat units clustered into 2 distinct groups
that are separated by a putative transmembrane domain. Northern blot
analysis detected ubiquitous expression of a major 4.4-kb transcript,
with prominent expression in pancreas.

MAPPING

By FISH, Li et al. (2000) mapped the WDR6 gene to chromosome 15q21.
However, Gross (2011) mapped the WDR6 gene to chromosome 3p21.31 based
on an alignment of the WDR6 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF099100) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

611532	TITLE *611532 NUCLEOLAR PROTEIN 6; NOL6
;;NUCLEOLAR RNA-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; NRAP;;
UTP22, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; UTP22
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening a mouse embryonic stem cell cDNA library with a partial
Nol6 clone, followed by 5-prime RACE, database analysis, and RT-PCR of
human hepatic cell line RNA, Utama et al. (2002) cloned full-length
human and mouse NOL6, which they called NRAP. They identified
NOL6-alpha, -beta, and -gamma isoforms that contain 1,146, 1,007, and
699 amino acids, respectively. NOL6-alpha shares 88% amino acid identity
with mouse Nol6-alpha. Both human and mouse coding regions are GC-rich
and share weak homology to a PAP/25A core domain, which is found in
poly(A) polymerases (605553). NOL6 contains potential nuclear
localization signals and has several potential phosphorylation sites.
Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence studies localized Nol6
expression within the nucleolus in a variety of rodent cell lines,
although expression was not specifically localized to rRNA transcription
sites. Nol6 localized to the condensed chromosomes during mitosis in a
pattern similar to that of B23/nucleophosmin (NPM1; 164040). In situ
hybridization studies in mouse embryos showed ubiquitous Nol6 expression
during development. Immunoblot studies of mouse tissues detected strong
expression in spleen, testis, colon, kidney, stomach, and brain, with
moderate expression in lung, liver, and small intestine, and low
expression in heart and skeletal muscle.

By database analysis, Bernstein et al. (2004) identified NOL6 as the
human ortholog of yeast Utp22. Utp22 is a component of a yeast
ribonucleoprotein required for biogenesis of the 18S rRNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Utama et al. (2002) showed that both actinomycin D and RNase treatment
disrupted Nol6 nucleolar localization while cyclohexamide had no effect.
They suggested that Nol6 interacts either directly or indirectly with
the pre-rRNA transcript.

GENE STRUCTURE

Utama et al. (2002) determined that the NOL6 gene contains 26 exons
spanning 11.4 kb. Alternative splicing excludes exons 24 and 25 in
NOL6-beta and skips exons 16 to 25 in the NOL6-gamma isoform.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Utama et al. (2002) mapped the NOL6 gene
to chromosome 9p13.

606267	TITLE *606267 WINGLESS-TYPE MMTV INTEGRATION SITE FAMILY, MEMBER 16; WNT16
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The WNT gene family consists of structurally related genes, such as
WNT16, encoding secreted signaling molecules that have been implicated
in oncogenesis and in several developmental processes, including
regulation of cell fate and patterning during embryogenesis. For general
information about WNT genes, see WNT1 (164820).

CLONING

Using representational difference analysis (RDA) to search for genes
upregulated by E2A-Pbx1 (see 176310), a chimeric transcription factor
generated by a chromosomal translocation found in pre-B acute
lymphoblastoid leukemias (ALL), McWhirter et al. (1999) identified a
novel member of the WNT gene family, which they designated WNT16. They
also identified a putative mouse homolog by screening a mouse genomic
library with the human WNT16 cDNA. WNT16 encodes a deduced 365-amino
acid protein with characteristics of a secreted protein, including a
hydrophobic signal peptide and many conserved cysteine residues located
throughout the protein. The WNT16 protein shares 42 to 48% sequence
identity with WNT2B (601968). Using Northern blot analysis, McWhirter et
al. (1999) detected a 3.2-kb WNT16 transcript in brain and placenta.
They also observed 3.0- and 3.5-kb transcripts in peripheral lymphoid
organs including spleen, lymph node, and appendix, but not bone marrow.
In contrast, they detected high levels of WNT16 transcripts in bone
marrow and cell lines derived from pre-B ALL patients carrying the
E2A-Pbx1 hybrid gene. Northern blot analysis of mouse embryos detected
Wnt16 expression at embryonic days 11, 15, and 17.

GENE FUNCTION

From results of studies with antisense oligonucleotides, McWhirter et
al. (1999) concluded that the E2A-Pbx1 fusion protein consistently
activates transcription of WNT16 in pre-B ALL, raising the possibility
that a WNT16-mediated autocrine growth mechanism may contribute to the
initiation or progression of t(1;19)-positive leukemia.

Guo et al. (2004) found that several Wnt genes, including Wnt4 (603490),
Wnt14 (602863), and Wnt16, were expressed in overlapping and
complementary patterns in developing mouse synovial joints, where
beta-catenin (CTNNB1; 116806) protein level and transcription activity
were upregulated. They presented evidence indicating that the Wnt/CTNNB1
signaling pathway is necessary and sufficient to induce early steps of
synovial joint formation. Guo et al. (2004) suggested that WNT4, WNT14,
and WNT16 may play redundant roles in synovial joint induction by
signaling through the CTNNB1-mediated canonical Wnt pathway.

In zebrafish, Clements et al. (2011) demonstrated that Wnt16 controls a
novel genetic regulatory network required for hematopoietic stem cell
specification. Noncanonical signaling by Wnt16 is required for somitic
expression of the Notch (190198) ligands delta-C (dlc) and delta-D (dld)
(see 606582), and these ligands are, in turn, required for the
establishment of definitive hematopoiesis. Notch signaling downstream of
Dlc and Dld is earlier than, and distinct from, known cell-autonomous
requirements for Notch, strongly suggesting that novel Notch-dependent
relay signal(s) induce the first hematopoietic stem cells in parallel to
other established pathways. Clements et al. (2011) concluded that
somite-specific gene expression is required for the production of
hemogenic endothelium in zebrafish.

605340	TITLE *605340 CYTOCHROME P450, SUBFAMILY IIIA, POLYPEPTIDE 7; CYP3A7
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CYP3A enzymes are the most abundantly expressed cytochrome P450 enzymes
in liver and are responsible for the metabolism of more than 50% of all
clinically used drugs (Paulussen et al., 2000).

CLONING

By screening a human fetal liver cDNA library with a fragment of a P450
cDNA as probe, Komori et al. (1989) obtained a full-length CYP3A7 cDNA
encoding a deduced 503-amino acid protein that shares 87% sequence
identity with CYP3A4 (124010). Komori et al. (1990) found that CYP3A7 is
expressed specifically in fetal livers but not in adult livers, opposite
to the expression pattern of CYP3A4.

Schuetz et al. (1993) used Western blot analysis to show that CYP3A7 is
expressed in placental and endometrial microsomes as a 51.5-kD protein
that increases dramatically from the first to the second trimester of
pregnancy. Northern blot analysis also showed increased expression of a
2.1-kb transcript in endometria of pregnant compared with nonpregnant
women as well as an increase from the first to the second trimester of
pregnancy.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Itoh et al. (1992) determined that the
CYP3A7 gene contains 13 exons and spans at least 17.1 kb. Sequence
analysis of the 5-prime flanking region identified putative
estrogen-response element (ERE), progesterone-response element (PRE),
AP3 (see 602416), GF1 (GATA1; 305371), and basic transcription element
(BTE) binding sites as well as a CAAT box. Gel shift analysis indicated
that BTEB (602902) interacts with the 5-prime flanking region of CYP3A7.

GENE FUNCTION

Masuyama et al. (2003) examined the expression and potential role of the
pregnane X receptor (PXR; 603065)-CYP3A pathway in endometrial cancer
tissues. Tissues showing high PXR expression showed significantly high
expression of PXR targets CYP3A4 and CYP3A7 and low expression of the
estrogen receptor (ER; see 133430) compared with levels in tissues
showing low PXR expression. Among endometrial cancer cell lines, HEC-1
cells, which express high PXR and low ER and progesterone receptor
(607311), showed a stronger transcriptional response of the PXR-CYP3A
pathway to PXR ligands than did Ishikawa cells, which express low PXR
but high ER. The authors concluded that steroid/xenobiotics metabolism
in tumor tissue through the PXR-CYP3A pathway might play an important
role as an alternative pathway for gonadal hormone and
endocrine-disrupting chemical effects on endometrial cancer expressing
low ER-alpha.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the CYP3A7
gene to chromosome 7 (TMAP D00408).

Gellner et al. (2001) found that on chromosome 7q21.1, where the CYP3A4
gene had previously been mapped, there is a 231-kb region containing 3
CYP3A genes: CYP3A4, CYP3A5 (605325), and CYP3A7, as well as 3
pseudogenes and a novel CYP3A gene, which they termed CYP3A43 (606534).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Burk et al. (2002) described several alleles of CYP3A7 in Caucasians
that were associated with high expression of CYP3A7 in adult liver and
intestine and included polymorphisms in the promoter region that altered
expression profiles. One polymorphism replaced part of the CYP3A7
promoter with the corresponding region of CYP3A4 containing the
PXR-binding motif. This mutation conferred a CYP3A4-like expression
pattern to CYP3A7.

Smit et al. (2005) presented evidence that heterozygosity for the
CYP3A7*1C polymorphism causes the persistence of enzymatic activity of
CYP3A7 during adult life, resulting in lower circulating
dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and estrone levels. However, they found no
indication in the 2 populations of healthy elderly individuals studied
that such lowered levels were associated with an acceleration of the
aging process.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

DeMartino et al. (1991) cloned a partial cDNA encoding the PSMB6
subunit, termed 'subunit delta.' Akiyama et al. (1994) cloned the
full-length cDNA, which encoded a 239-amino acid polypeptide. The amino
acid sequence has significant homology to other proteasome beta
subunits. See PSMB5 (600306).

GENE FUNCTION

Coux et al. (1996) reviewed the structures and functions of the 20S
proteasome subunits. The beta subunits are believed to form the inner
rings of the proteasome and to mediate proteolysis.

MAPPING

Belich et al. (1994) mapped the PSMB6 gene to 17p13 by fluorescence in
situ hybridization.

605920	TITLE *605920 STAUFEN, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 2; STAU2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The STAU2 gene encodes a protein homologous to both human STAU1 (601716)
and Drosophila staufen, a double-stranded RNA-binding protein required
both for the localization of maternal determinants to the posterior pole
of the Drosophila egg and for bicoid RNA to localize correctly to the
anterior pole (summary by Buchner et al., 1999).

CLONING

Buchner et al. (1999) determined that a transcriptional unit thought to
map to chromosome Xp showed 100% sequence homology with a cDNA clone
mapped to chromosome 8q13-q21. Using a segment of this clone to screen a
neural precursor cell cDNA library, they cloned the full-length cDNA,
the sequence of which matched 2 ESTs on chromosome 8q13-q21.1. A related
sequence matched an EST on chromosome Xq, but was considered to be a
pseudogene. The full-length cDNA on chromosome 8, designated STAU2,
encodes a deduced 479-amino acid protein that shares 48.5% and 59.9%
similarity to the Drosophila staufen and the human staufen-1 (STAU;
601716) proteins, respectively. The STAU2 protein contains 3 predicted
double-stranded RNA-binding domains (dsRBDs), including a conserved
dsRBD, present in Drosophila staufen and human STAU, which has been
demonstrated to be responsible for RNA binding. Using the full-length
STAU2 cDNA as query, Buchner et al. (1999) identified 40 different ESTs
derived from different tissues, demonstrating that STAU2 is ubiquitously
expressed.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Buchner et al. (1999) mapped the STAU2 gene to
chromosome 8q13-q21.

MONARCH 1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NALPs are cytoplasmic proteins that form a subfamily within the larger
CATERPILLER protein family. Most short NALPs, such as NALP12, have an
N-terminal pyrin (MEFV; 608107) domain (PYD), followed by a NACHT
domain, a NACHT-associated domain (NAD), and a C-terminal leucine-rich
repeat (LRR) region. The long NALP, NALP1 (606636), also has a
C-terminal extension containing a function to find domain (FIIND) and a
caspase recruitment domain (CARD). NALPs are implicated in the
activation of proinflammatory caspases (e.g., CASP1; 147678) via their
involvement in multiprotein complexes called inflammasomes (Tschopp et
al., 2003).

CLONING

Using representational difference analysis with a nitric oxide-treated
leukemia cell line, Shami et al. (2001) isolated a cDNA encoding NALP12,
which they termed RNO. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a
3.0-kb transcript in polymorphonuclear cells and monocytes.

By searching databases for PYPAF homologs, Wang et al. (2002) identified
NALP12, which they called PYPAF7. The predicted 1,061-amino acid protein
has an N-terminal PYRIN domain, a central NACHT-type nucleotide-binding
site domain, and a C-terminal domain with at least 12 LRR motifs.
Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses revealed expression in peripheral
blood leukocytes, with little to no expression in 75 other tissues and
cell lines examined. Real-time PCR detected expression predominantly in
eosinophils and granulocytes, with lower expression in monocytes.

By searching for genes with homology to CIITA (MHC2TA; 600005), followed
by RT-PCR and RACE using monocyte cell line cDNA, Williams et al. (2003)
obtained a cDNA encoding NALP12, which they called monarch-1. The
full-length 1,063-amino acid monarch-1 protein is identical to PYPAF7
(Wang et al., 2002) except that it has an additional arg at position
692. Williams et al. (2003) also identified monarch-1 splice variants
lacking 9 (isoform II), exons 7 and 8 (isoform III), and exons 7 through
9 (isoform IV).

GENE FUNCTION

Using coexpression studies, Wang et al. (2002) found that PYPAF7
associated with ASC (PYCARD; 606838) in a PYD-dependent manner.
Immunoblot and luciferase reporter analyses showed that ASC and PYPAF7
synergistically participated in activation of NFKB (see 164011) and
procaspase-1. Wang et al. (2002) concluded that PYPAF7 has a role in the
transduction of proinflammatory signals leading to activation of NFKB
and procaspase-1.

By microarray and real-time RT-PCR analyses following expression of
monarch-1 in nonexpressing cell lines, Williams et al. (2003) found that
monarch-1 upregulated classical and nonclassical MHC I genes, as well as
LMP7 (PSMB8; 177046). TNF (191160) and IFNG (147570), which upregulate
MHC expression, downregulated monarch-1 expression, suggesting that
monarch-1 may represent a separate pathway for MHC I induction.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Wang et al. (2002) mapped the NALP12 gene
to chromosome 19q13.4 in close proximity to most other NALP genes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 2 unrelated families with familial cold
autoinflammatory syndrome-2 (FCAS2; 611762), Jeru et al. (2008)
identified heterozygosity for mutation in the NLRP12 gene (609648.0001
and 609648.0002, respectively). The findings indicated a dominant mode
of expression through haploinsufficiency.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
FAMILIAL COLD AUTOINFLAMMATORY SYNDROME 2
NLRP12, ARG284TER

In a father and his twin sons with cold autoinflammatory syndrome-2
(FCAS2; 611762), Jeru et al. (2008) identified a heterozygous 850C-T
transition in exon 3 of the NLRP12 gene, resulting in an arg284-to-ter
(R284X) substitution within the nucleotide binding site of the protein.
The family was from Guadeloupe. The phenotype included episodic fever,
arthralgia, myalgia, and urticaria triggered by cold exposure. Both sons
had sensorineural hearing loss. In vitro functional expression studies
showed that the mutant NLRP12 had reduced inhibitory action against
NF-kappa-B (164011) compared to wildtype NLRP12.

FAMILIAL COLD AUTOINFLAMMATORY SYNDROME 2
NLRP12, IVS3DS, 1-BP INS, +3T

In a father and daughter from Guadeloupe with cold autoinflammatory
syndrome-2 (FCAS2; 611762), Jeru et al. (2008) identified a 1-bp
insertion (2072+3insT) within the donor splice site of intron 3,
resulting in a frameshift and premature protein truncation. The daughter
had the more severe phenotype, characterized by episodic fever,
abdominal pain, buccal aphthous ulcers, and arthralgia triggered by
cold. In vitro functional expression studies showed that the mutant
NLRP12 had reduced inhibitory action against NF-kappa-B (164011)
compared to wildtype NLRP12.

610666	TITLE *610666 NEURENSIN 2; NRSN2
DESCRIPTION Using BLAST analysis with the sequence of mouse neurensin-1 (NRSN1) as
query, Nakanishi et al. (2006) identified mouse and human sequences of a
homologous gene that they named neurensin-2 (NRSN2). Human NRSN2 protein
contains 2 membrane-spanning domains and shares 41% identity with mouse
Nrsn1. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues showed brain-specific
expression of a 1.7-kb Nrsn2 transcript. Immunoblot analysis showed
expression of Nrsn2 protein from embryonic day 15.5, with robust
expression seen from postnatal days 7 through 14 and at 10 weeks of age.
Immunoblot analysis of brain regions showed that Nrsn2 is broadly
expressed throughout the cerebral cortex, with highest expression in the
thalamus/hypothalamus. Indirect immunofluorescence in transfected
Neuro2a cells showed that Nrsn2 localizes to perinuclear organelles and
processes in regions distinct from those stained by Nrsn1, and in
transfected COS-7 cells showed that Nrsn2 localizes to lysosomes.
Immunohistochemistry in mouse brain showed similar overall distributions
for Nrsn2 and Nrsn1 but different subcellular localizations, with Nrsn2
in somatic regions and Nrsn1 in neuritic processes. Nrsn2-positive cells
were seen in the septum nucleus, diagonal band, hippocampus, amygdaloid
nucleus, habenula nucleus, and cerebral pyriform cortex, and prominent
immunostaining was seen in cell bodies of cerebellar Purkinje cells.

;;DERMAL PAPILLA-DERIVED PROTEIN 6; DERP6;;
CHROMOSOME 17 OPEN READING FRAME 81; C17ORF81
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ELP5 is 1 of 6 subunits of the elongator complex. Elongator promotes RNA
polymerase II transcript elongation through histone acetylation in the
nucleus and also regulates translational fidelity through tRNA
modification in the cytoplasm (summary by Close et al., 2012).

CLONING

By PCR of a human testis cDNA library, Yuan et al. (2006) cloned ELP5,
which they called DERP6. The deduced protein contains 316 amino acids.
Northern blot analysis detected variable expression of a major 1.5-kb
DERP6 transcript in all 16 human tissues examined, with highest
expression in heart, brain, liver, skeletal muscle, and testis.
Fluorescence-tagged DERP6 showed a punctate cytoplasmic distribution in
transfected COS-7 cells.

By mass spectrometric analysis of proteins that copurified with the
elongator complex in HEK293 cells, Close et al. (2012) identified ELP5.
The deduced protein contains a large central HAP2 (NFYA; 189903)
elongator superfamily domain. SDS-PAGE detected ELP5 at an apparent
molecular mass of 38 kD. In fractionated cells, Western blot analysis
detected most ELP5 in the cytosolic fraction, with a small proportion in
the nuclear fraction.

GENE FUNCTION

Yuan et al. (2006) found that human DERP6 increased transcriptional
activity of a p53 (TP53; 191170) reporter. DERP6 had no effect on other
transcription factors examined.

Using RNA interference, Close et al. (2012) found that depletion of any
of the elongator complex components Elp1 (IKBKAP; 603722), Elp3
(612722), Elp5, or Elp6 (615020) in B16-F10 mouse melanoma cells reduced
cell motility in a wound-healing assay and reduced the capacity of cells
to form colonies in soft agar. Deletion analysis revealed that 2 ELP5
domains interacted with ELP4 (606985) and that 2 distinct ELP5 domains
interacted with ELP1 and ELP3. Protein pull-down assays revealed that
ELP5 was required for interaction of ELP3 with ELP4.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yuan et al. (2006) determined that the ELP5 gene contains 8 exons and
spans about 8 kb. All exons contain coding sequence.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Yuan et al. (2006) mapped the ELP5 gene to
chromosome 17p13.1.

610677	TITLE *610677 LSM14A PROTEIN; LSM14A
;;RNA-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 55; RAP55
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Sm-like proteins were identified in a variety of organisms based on
sequence homology with the Sm protein family (see SNRPD2; 601061).
Sm-like proteins contain the Sm sequence motif, which consists of 2
regions separated by a linker of variable length that folds as a loop.
The Sm-like proteins are thought to form a stable heteromer present in
tri-snRNP particles, which are important for pre-mRNA splicing.

CLONING

P-bodies are discrete cytoplasmic structures that contain enzymes
involved in mRNA degradation and have been implicated in RNAi-mediated
posttranscriptional gene silencing. Using immunofluorescence and
immunoblot assays on human HEP2 cells, Yang et al. (2006) showed that
antibodies in serum from patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC;
109720) are reactive to a 60-kD protein present in P-bodies. Human cDNA
expression library screening with PBC serum identified this protein as
RNA-associated protein, 55-kD (RAP55), also known as LSM14A. LSM14A
encodes a 463-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 50.5
kD that contains an N-terminal LSM domain and 2 RGG-rich domains
flanking an FDF motif at the C terminus. Proteins containing LSM domains
comprise a family of RNA-binding proteins (see 607281); RGG-rich domains
are found in RNA-binding proteins including human HNRNPU (602869),
fibrillarin (134795), and nucleolin (164035), and FDF motifs have been
proposed to interact with RNA or RNP complex members. A series of
transfections of HEP2 cells with LSM14A showed that LSM14A localizes to
P-bodies, and both the RGG domains and the FDF motif are required for
this localization. Database searches showed that LSM14A homologs exist
in C. elegans, Drosophila, Pleurodeles (newt), and Xenopus. Examination
of Unigene showed nearly ubiquitous LSM14A expression during all
developmental stages, and immunohistochemistry showed expression of
LSM14A in human cell lines including lymphocytes, monocytes, Hep2, A549,
Be2C, and U2OS cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using Hep2 cells transfected with LSM14A, Yang et al. (2006) showed that
LSM14A is targeted to stress granules during arsenite-induced oxidative
stress, and that the C-terminal RGG domain is necessary and sufficient
for this targeting. Downregulation of LSM14A in Hep2 cells by siRNA
resulted in the loss of P-bodies.

;;TOLLOID, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF; TLD;;
PROCOLLAGEN C-PROTEINASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Bone morphogenetic protein-1/Tolloid is the prototype of a family of
metalloproteases implicated in embryonic patterning in diverse species.
Members of this family contain an astacin-like protease domain and
varying numbers of CUB protein-protein interaction domains and EGF
motifs (Bond and Beynon, 1995).

CLONING

The BMP1 locus encodes a protein that is capable of inducing formation
of cartilage in vivo (Wozney et al., 1988). Although other bone
morphogenetic proteins are members of the TGF-beta (190180) superfamily,
BMP1 encodes a novel protein that is not closely related to other known
growth factors.

In mammals, a single BMP1 gene apparently encodes alternatively spliced
transcript not only for BMP1 but also for a larger protein with a domain
structure identical to that of the Drosophila dorsal-ventral patterning
gene product Tolloid (Tld) (Takahara et al., 1994).

Kessler et al. (1996) showed that recombinantly expressed BMP1 and
purified procollagen C proteinase (PCP), a secreted metalloprotease
requiring calcium and needed for cartilage and bone formation, are, in
fact, identical. PCP cleaves the C-terminal propeptides of procollagen I
(120150), II (120140), and III (120180) and its activity is increased by
the procollagen C-endopeptidase enhancer protein (600270). Reddi (1996)
discussed the significance of the finding that BMP1 is the same as
procollagen C-proteinase.

GENE FUNCTION

Amano et al. (2000) found that BMP1 cleaves the laminin-5 (LAMA3;
600805) chain at sites within the G4 subdomain and the IIIa domain and
that BMP1 cleaves the LAMC2 (150292) chain within the second EGF
(131530)-like repeat of domain III. Immunocytochemical analysis showed
that BMP1 is localized to the basal epithelial cell layer in embryonic
bovine skin, supporting the likelihood that BMP1 is involved in
laminin-5 processing in vivo as well as in vitro.

Scott et al. (1999) compared enzymatic activities and expression domains
of 4 mammalian BMP1/TLD-like proteases and found differences in their
ability to process fibrillar collagen precursors and to cleave chordin
(603475). As previously demonstrated for BMP1 and TLD, TLL1 (606742)
specifically processes procollagen C-propeptides at the physiologically
relevant site, whereas TLL2 (606743) lacks this activity. BMP1 and TLL1
cleave chordin, at sites similar to procollagen C-propeptide cleavage
sites, and counteract dorsalizing effects of chordin upon overexpression
on Xenopus embryos. Proteases TLD and TLL2 do not cleave chordin. Scott
et al. (1999) suggested that BMP1 is the major chordin antagonist in
early mammalian embryogenesis and in pre- and postnatal skeletogenesis.

In addition to expression in pituitary and placenta and functions in
growth and reproduction, prolactin (PRL; 176760), growth hormone (GH;
139250), and placental lactogen (CSH1; 150200) are expressed in
endothelial cells and have angiogenic effects. Ge et al. (2007) found
that BMP1 and BMP1-like proteinases processed PRL and GH in vitro and in
vivo to produce approximately 17-kD N-terminal fragments with
antiangiogenic activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Takahara et al. (1995) described the organization of the 46-kb, 22-exon
human BMP1/TLD gene. Exons corresponding to each of the alternatively
spliced transcripts were identified and comparison with the Drosophila
Tld gene revealed alignment of introns at only 3 positions. The major
BMP1/TLD transcription start site was found only 706 bp downstream of
the polyadenylation site of the SFTP2 surfactant gene (178620), and a
previously reported highly polymorphic CA repeat was found within the
BMP1/TLD first intron. These 2 findings placed the BMP1/TLD gene between
markers D8S298 and D8S5 on the genetic map.

MAPPING

Ceci et al. (1990) mapped murine Bmp1 to a region of mouse chromosome 14
close to esterase-10 and the murine homolog of the human RB1 gene
(614041); thus, it was considered possible for the human homolog of Bmp1
to be located on 13q14. However, using cDNA probes in the analysis of
somatic cell hybrid lines, Tabas et al. (1991) demonstrated that the
BMP1 gene maps to chromosome 8. By in situ hybridization, Yoshiura et
al. (1993) mapped the BMP1 gene to 8p21.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By genomewide homozygosity mapping in a consanguineous Egyptian family
in which 2 sibs had a severe form of autosomal recessive osteogenesis
imperfecta (OI13; 614856), Martinez-Glez et al. (2012) identified a
region of homozygosity on 8p containing the BMP1 gene. By direct
sequencing of this gene in the proband, they identified homozygosity for
a missense mutation (F249L; 112264.0001). The same mutation was found in
homozygous state in the proband's affected brother and in heterozygous
state in their parents and unaffected sibs.

In 2 affected sibs of a consanguineous family from Turkey with increased
bone mineral density and multiple recurrent fractures, Asharani et al.
(2012) identified homozygosity for a missense mutation (G12R;
112264.0002) in the BMP1 gene. The mutation was identified by combined
whole-exome sequencing and filtering for homozygous stretches of
identified variants.

Yang et al. (2010) reported that holoprosencephaly (HPE; see 236100) in
mice can result from simultaneous reduction in both Nodal (601265)
signaling and expression levels of the Bmp antagonists chordin (CHRD;
603475) or Noggin (NOG; 602991). HPE defects are the result of reduced
production of tissues that promote forebrain and craniofacial
development. Nodal promotes the expression of genes in the anterior
primitive streak important for the development of these tissues, whereas
Bmp inhibits their expression. Pharmacologic and transgenic manipulation
of these signaling pathways suggested that the Bmp and Nodal pathways
antagonize each other prior to intracellular signal transduction. In
vitro experiments indicated that secreted Bmp2 (112261) and Nodal can
form extracellular complexes, potentially interfering with receptor
activation. Yang et al. (2010) concluded that the patterning of
forebrain and medial craniofacial elements requires a fine balance
between BMP and NODAL signaling during primitive streak development.

ANIMAL MODEL

Asharani et al. (2012) characterized a zebrafish bone mutant harboring
lesions in bmp1a, demonstrating conservation of BMP1 function in
osteogenesis across species. Genetic, biochemical, and histologic
analyses of this mutant and a comparison to a second, similar locus
revealed that Bmp1a is critically required for mature-collagen
generation, downstream of osteoblast maturation, in bone.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
OSTEOGENESIS IMPERFECTA, TYPE XIII
BMP1, PHE249LEU

In 2 Egyptian children from a consanguineous family with severe
osteogenesis imperfecta and a large umbilical hernia (OI13; 614856),
Martinez-Glez et al. (2012) identified a homozygous 747C-G transversion
in exon 6 of the BMP1 gene, resulting in a phe249-to-leu (F249L)
substitution. Segregation analysis of the mutation within the family
showed that the unaffected sister and brother and parents carried the
mutation in heterozygous state. The mutation was not found in 100
chromosomes from ethnically matched controls or in 884 chromosomes from
European controls.

Martinez-Glez et al. (2012) performed type I procollagen analysis in
supernatants from cultured fibroblasts and demonstrated abnormal PICP
processing in patient-derived cells consistent with the F249L mutation
causing decreased BMP1 function. This was further confirmed by
overexpressing wildtype and mutant BMP1 longer isoform (mammalian
Tolloid protein; mTLD) in NIH3T3 fibroblasts and human primary
fibroblasts. Whereas overproduction of normal mTLD resulted in a large
proportion of pro-alpha-1(I) in the culture media being C-terminally
processed, pro-alpha-1(I) cleavage was not enhanced by an excess of the
mutant protein, proving that the mutation leads to a BMP1/mTLD protein
with deficient PICP proteolytic activity.

.0002
OSTEOGENESIS IMPERFECTA, TYPE XIII
BMP1, GLY12ARG

In 2 children from a consanguineous family from Turkey affected by
increased bone mineral density and multiple recurrent fractures (OI13;
614856), Asharani et al. (2012) identified a homozygous 34G-C
transversion in exon 1 of the BMP1 gene, resulting in a gly12-to-arg
(G12R) substitution within the signal peptide; this signal peptide is
essential for the protein's localization to the endoplasmic reticulum,
correct posttranslational glycosylation, and secretion. Asharani et al.
(2012) confirmed in in vitro assays that the mutation leads to severely
reduced posttranslational N-glycosylation of the protein and impairs
protein secretion. They also showed that the mutation leads to both
reduced secretion and subsequent reduced processing of the substrates
chordin and collagen I.

;;ADENYLYL CYCLASE 2;;
ADENYLYL CYCLASE, BRAIN, TYPE II
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ADCY2 belongs to the adenylate cyclase (EC 4.6.1.1) family of enzymes
responsible for the synthesis of cAMP (Ludwig and Seuwen, 2002).

CLONING

Stengel et al. (1992) identified a brain cDNA corresponding to a gene
that encodes a human brain adenylyl cyclase, which they symbolized
HBAC2. The amino acid sequence of ADCY2 displayed significant homology
with ADCY8 (103070) in the highly conserved adenylyl cyclase domain (250
amino acids) found in the 3-prime cytoplasmic portion of all mammalian
adenylyl cyclases. However, outside this domain, the homology was
extremely low.

Wong et al. (2000) identified the presence of adenylyl cyclases 2, 3
(600291), and 4 (600292) in olfactory cilia.

By database analysis, Ludwig and Seuwen (2002) identified full-length
ADCY2, encoding a deduced protein of 1,086 amino acids. Semiquantitative
RT-PCR detected ADCY2 in all tissues examined except peripheral blood
leukocytes. Highest expression was detected in brain, skeletal muscle,
and testis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ludwig and Seuwen (2002) determined that the ADCY2 gene contains 25
exons and spans 429.7 kb.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization to metaphase chromosomal spreads using a human
brain cDNA probe, Stengel et al. (1992) demonstrated that the ADCY2 gene
maps to 5p15.3. Using Southern blot analysis of somatic cell hybrid
DNAs, Gaudin et al. (1994) likewise mapped type II adenylyl cyclase to
chromosome 5. Furthermore, they determined the chromosomal location of 4
other isoforms: type III on chromosome 2, type IV on chromosome 14, type
V on chromosome 3, and type VI on chromosome 12. By fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Edelhoff et al. (1995) mapped the mouse homolog to
chromosome 13 in the C1 region.

612503	TITLE *612503 ATP-BINDING CASSETTE, SUBFAMILY A, MEMBER 5; ABCA5
;;KIAA1888
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the ABC family of membrane proteins, such as ABCA5, are
involved in energy-dependent transport of a wide variety of substrates
across membranes (Allikmets et al., 1996).

CLONING

Using the N-terminal ATP-binding domain of PGY1 (ABCB1; 171050) and the
complete sequence of CFTR (602421) to query a human EST database,
Allikmets et al. (1996) identified an ABCA5 clone, which they designated
EST90625, from an infant spleen cDNA library. Northern blot analysis
detected a 7-kb transcript in heart and skeletal muscle and a 2.5-kb
transcript in liver.

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2001) cloned ABCA5, which they designated
KIAA1888. The deduced 737-amino acid protein shares significant
similarity with ABCA2 (600047). RT-PCR ELISA detected moderate ABCA5
expression in all tissues and specific brain regions examined, with
highest levels in skeletal muscle and cerebellum.

By RT-PCR of testis RNA, followed by 5-prime RACE of hepatoma cell line
RNA, Petry et al. (2003) cloned full-length ABCA5. The deduced
1,642-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 183 kD. It
has up to 16 predicted transmembrane segments in 2 transmembrane
domains, which are followed by their respective nucleotide-binding
folds. Petry et al. (2003) also identified 2 alternatively-spliced ABCA5
transcripts, one of which encodes a 925-amino acid ABC half-transporter
with 9 transmembrane segments and only the first nucleotide-binding fold
of the full-length protein. Northern blot analysis detected a 6.2-kb
transcript in skeletal muscle, with lower levels in kidney, liver, and
placenta.

Using RT-PCR, Ohtsuki et al. (2004) detected expression of ABCA2 and
ABCA5 in cultured human brain capillary endothelial cells, which form
the blood-brain barrier.

Kubo et al. (2005) cloned mouse Abca5. The deduced 1,642-amino acid
protein has 12 membrane-spanning segments and 2 nucleotide-binding
domains, and it shares 77% identity with human ABCA5. Northern blot
analysis detected 3 mouse Abca5 transcripts, with high expression in
brain, testis, and lung, and lower expression in heart, liver, kidney,
skeletal muscle, and placenta. Immunofluorescence microscopy localized
Abca5 in cardiomyocytes of heart, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes of
brain, alveolar type II cells of lung, and in a lysosome-related
compartment of lung epithelial cells, but Abca5 was not observed in
liver. In transfected cells, Abca5 colocalized with marker proteins of
lysosomes and late endosomes. Glycosidase treatment reduced the apparent
molecular mass of Abca5, suggesting that it is a glycoprotein.

GENE STRUCTURE

Petry et al. (2003) determined that the ABCA5 gene contains 39 exons and
spans about 80 kb. Exon 2 contains the putative translation start site.

MAPPING

Using somatic cell hybrid, radiation hybrid, and YAC analyses, Allikmets
et al. (1996) mapped the ABCA5 gene to chromosome 17q21-q24. By genomic
sequence analysis, Petry et al. (2003) mapped the ABCA5 gene to
chromosome 17q24.3, where it is the first gene in a tandem array of 5
related ABCA genes.

ANIMAL MODEL

Kubo et al. (2005) obtained Abca5 -/- mice at a mendelian ratio, and the
mutant mice were fertile. Upon reaching adulthood, they exhibited
subcutaneous edema, exophthalmos, and trembling, and they finally died.
Prior to death, Abca5 -/- cardiomyocytes showed degeneration due to
vacuolation and accumulation of autolysosomes and autophagosomes.
Exophthalmos was accompanied by hypothyroidism due to collapse of
thyroid follicles.

120290	TITLE *120290 COLLAGEN, TYPE XI, ALPHA-2; COL11A2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Type XI collagen, a fibril-forming collagen found mainly in the
cartilage extracellular matrix, is important for the integrity and
development of the skeleton (summary by Lui et al., 1996).

CLONING

Kimura et al. (1989) cloned human COL11A2, which encodes a deduced
protein with high sequence similarity to COL11A1 (120280). By Northern
blot analysis, Kimura et al. (1989) showed that COL11A2 is expressed in
cartilage but not in adult liver, skin, and tendon.

MAPPING

Law et al. (1989, 1990) used a cosmid clone containing the COL11A2 gene
as a probe in the Southern blot analysis of DNA from a panel of
human/hamster somatic cell hybrids containing different numbers and
combinations of human chromosomes. They concluded that the gene is
located on chromosome 6, and study of a cell hybrid containing only 6q
indicated that the COL11A2 gene is on 6p.

By a combination of somatic cell hybrid mapping and in situ
hybridization, Hanson et al. (1989, 1989) localized the COL11A2 gene to
6p21.3. By physical mapping of the class II HLA region using pulsed
field gel electrophoresis, Hanson et al. (1991) demonstrated that the
COL11A2 gene is about 45 kb centromeric to HLA-DPA1 (142880) and is
transcribed in the opposite (i.e., telomeric) direction.

Kimura et al. (1989) assigned the COL11A2 gene to 6p21.2 by in situ
hybridization. The nucleotide sequence showed that although type XI
collagen belongs to the fibril-forming class of collagens, there are
substantial differences in exon sizes at the 3-prime end of the gene
when comparing the COL11A2 gene with the genes for types I, II, and III
collagens. It is thought that the alpha-3 chain of type XI collagen is a
posttranslational variant of the type II, or cartilage, collagen
subunit, i.e., is encoded by the COL2A1 gene (120140).

Stubbs et al. (1993) showed that the homologous gene in the mouse is
also 'embedded' within the major histocompatibility complex on
chromosome 17.

GENE STRUCTURE

Vuoristo et al. (1995) analyzed the COL11A2 gene from 2 overlapping
cosmid clones that had previously been isolated in the course of
searching the human major histocompatibility region. Nucleotide sequence
defined over 28,000 bp of the gene. It was shown to contain 66 exons. As
with most genes for fibrillar collagens, the first intron was among the
largest, and the introns at the 5-prime end of the gene were in general
larger than the introns at the 3-prime end. Analysis of the exons coding
for the major triple helical domain indicated that the gene structure
had not evolved with the genes for the major fibrillar collagen and that
there were marked differences in the number of exons, the exon sizes,
and codon usage. The gene was located close to the gene for the retinoid
X receptor beta (180246) in a head-to-tail arrangement similar to that
previously seen with the 2 mouse genes. Also, there was marked
interspecies homology in the intergenic sequences.

Lui et al. (1996) showed that COL11A2 contains at least 62 exons
spanning 30.5 kb. The gene differs from other collagens in that the
amino propeptide is encoded by 14 exons rather than the usual 5 to 8.
The promoter is GC-rich and lacks a TATA box. The authors believed that
the gene is likely to undergo alternative splicing. The gene lies within
the MHC region and is only 1.1-kb from the retinoid X receptor-beta
(180246) and about 40 kb from DPB2 (142880).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Melkoniemi et al. (2000) stated that in spite of partial overlap between
the Stickler (see 108300), Marshall (154780), Weissenbacher-Zweymuller
(277610), and otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia (OSMED; 215150)
phenotypes caused by mutations in the COL2A1 (120140), COL11A1 (120280),
and COL11A2 genes, absence of eye involvement in patients carrying
COL11A2 mutations is noteworthy. This was best explained by the finding
that the COL11A2 gene is not expressed in the vitreous body and that the
COL5A2 (120190) chain replaces the COL11A2 chain in the ocular vitreous
(Mayne et al., 1993).

- Stickler Syndrome, Type III

Type II collagen is closely associated with both type IX collagen
(120210) and type XI collagen in thin collagen fibrils of hyaline
cartilage. This prompted Brunner et al. (1994) to study linkage of a
Stickler syndrome phenotype (STL3; 184840) to polymorphic markers within
or near genes encoding these cartilage collagens. In a large Dutch
kindred, Stickler syndrome was found to be linked to the 6p22-p21.3
region where COL11A2 maps. Unlike the usual cases of Stickler syndrome
which show high myopia, vitreoretinal degeneration, and retinal
detachment, ocular features were lacking in all affected individuals in
the Dutch family. This may be explained by absence of the alpha-2 chain
of type XI collagen in the vitreous. The skeletal and otologic
manifestations of the Stickler syndrome were present in the family,
however. Vikkula et al. (1995) established that the affected members of
the Dutch kindred with Stickler syndrome reported by Brunner et al.
(1994) had a mutation in the COL11A2 gene (120290.0001).

Sirko-Osadsa et al. (1998) described a family with Stickler syndrome in
which there was no eye involvement and demonstrated that the phenotype
was due to heterozygosity for a 27-bp deletion in the COL11A2 gene
(120290.0003). The affected members of the family had sensorineural
hearing loss, cleft palate/uvula, micrognathia, malar flattening, joint
pains, and multiple hereditary exostoses.

- Weissenbacher-Zweymuller Syndrome

Pihlajamaa et al. (1998) demonstrated that the original patient
described by Weissenbacher and Zweymuller (1964) as a 'combination of a
Pierre Robin syndrome with a fetal chondrodysplasia' (WZS; 277610) had a
heterozygous mutation in the COL11A2 gene (120290.0004).

- Otospondylomegaepiphyseal Dysplasia

Vikkula et al. (1995) studied a Dutch kindred in which 3 sibs of a
consanguineous mating had a severe degenerative joint disease resembling
osteoarthritis that presented in early adulthood and affected
predominantly the hips, knees, elbows, and shoulders (OSMED; 215150).
Vikkula et al. (1995) found that the mutation in these sibs was a
gly175-to-arg mutation of the COL11A2 gene (120290.0002). van Steensel
et al. (1997) described the clinical and radiographic features of
otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia in these sibs.

Melkoniemi et al. (2000) reported 7 families with OSMED. All affected
individuals had a remarkably similar phenotype: profound sensorineural
hearing loss, skeletal dysplasia with limb shortening and large
epiphyses, cleft palate, very flat face, hypoplasia of the mandible, a
short nose with anteverted nares, and a flat nasal bridge. A different
mutation of the COL11A2 gene was identified in each family. In 4
families, including 3 with consanguineous parents, the mutations were
homozygous. Individuals in 3 other families, in which parents were
nonconsanguineous, were compound heterozygous. Of the 10 identified
mutations, 9 were predicted to cause premature termination of
translation, and 1 was predicted to cause an in-frame deletion.

In an Egyptian brother and sister with OSMED, Temtamy et al. (2006)
identified homozygosity for a 1-bp deletion in the COL11A2 gene
(120290.0011). The first-cousin parents were heterozygous for the
deletion; a younger brother was unaffected.

- Deafness, Autosomal Dominant 13

In 2 families, 1 American and 1 Dutch, with autosomal dominant,
nonsyndromic hearing loss (DFNA13; 601868) previously been mapped to 6p,
McGuirt et al. (1999) identified heterozygous mutations in the COL11A2
gene (120290.0005-120290.0006) that were predicted to affect the
triple-helix domain of the collagen protein. McGuirt et al. (1999) found
that mice with a targeted disruption of Col11a2 also showed hearing
loss. Electron microscopy of the tectorial membrane of these mice
revealed loss of organization of the collagen fibrils. The findings
revealed a unique ultrastructural malformation of the inner ear
architecture associated with nonsyndromic hearing loss, and suggested
that tectorial membrane abnormalities may be one etiology of
sensorineural hearing loss primarily affecting the mid-frequencies.

- Deafness, Autosomal Recessive 53

In 5 affected members of 2 sibships of a consanguineous Iranian family
with nonsyndromic hearing loss (DFNB53; 609706), Chen et al. (2005)
identified homozygosity for a missense mutation in the COL11A2 gene
(P621T; 120290.0008). The 4 parents and 1 sib were heterozygous for the
mutation.

- Fibrochondrogenesis 2

In a deceased infant with fibrochondrogenesis (FBCG2; 614524), born of
consanguineous parents, Tompson et al. (2012) identified homozygosity
for a splice site mutation in the COL11A2 gene (120290.0012). In another
deceased infant with fibrochondrogenesis, who was born of healthy
nonconsanguineous parents, they identified heterozygosity for a 9-bp
deletion (120290.0013).

- Associations Pending Confirmation

Among Japanese, ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament of
the spine (OPLL; 602475) is a leading cause of myelopathy, showing
ectopic bone formation in the paravertebral ligament. Maeda et al.
(2001) provided genetic evidence that the COL11A2 locus constitutes
susceptibility for OPLL. Five distinct SNPs identified in COL11A2 were
combined to construct haplotypes. A male-specific association with a
COL11A2 haplotype was found with OPLL. In a case-control study of 711
Japanese individuals with OPLL and 896 controls, Horikoshi et al. (2006)
found no association between 2 SNPs in the COL11A2 gene and OPLL.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
STICKLER SYNDROME, TYPE III
COL11A2, IVS, G-A, +1

In a large Dutch kindred with Stickler syndrome (184840), which was
found by Brunner et al. (1994) to map to the same region of 6p as the
COL11A2 gene, Vikkula et al. (1995) found heterozygosity for a 1-bp
change at the exon-intron boundary such that the intronic donor-site
sequence, GTGAG, was replaced by ATGAG. This change created a novel
NlaIII restriction site in the genomic sequence. The G-to-A transition
resulted in a 54-bp in-frame deletion, which represented deletion of the
exon 5-prime of the mutation. This exon sequence was located 108
nucleotides upstream of the junction between sequences encoding the
triple-helical and C-propeptide domains of the alpha-2(XI) chain.

.0002
OTOSPONDYLOMEGAEPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA
COL11A2, GLY175ARG

Vikkula et al. (1995) studied a Dutch kindred in which 3 sibs had a
severe degenerative joint disease resembling osteoarthritis that
presented in early adulthood and affected predominantly the hips, knees,
elbows, and shoulders (215150). The spine was less severely affected,
and adult height was only slightly below that of the unaffected sibs.
There was increased lumbar lordosis and prominent interphalangeal
joints. Short fifth metacarpals were found in all 3 sibs. The patients
had distinctive facial features with midface hypoplasia with a short
upturned nose, prominent eyes, depressed nasal bridge, and prominent
supraorbital ridges. Sensorineural hearing loss was present from birth
and required the use of hearing aids in all 3 affected sibs. None of the
3 had myopia or vitreoretinal degeneration. The parents were fourth
cousins. The affected sibs were found to be homozygous for an extended
haplotype of 7 CA dinucleotide repeat polymorphisms from 6p21 near the
COL11A2 locus. Using conservative estimates of 0.002 for the frequency
of the abnormal allele and 0.005 for the frequency of the marker
haplotype, Vikkula et al. (1995) obtained a lod score of 3.09 at theta =
0.0 for linkage of the disease phenotype to 6p21. To find the mutation
causing the autosomal recessive disorder, they used RT-PCR with total
RNA extracted from EBV-transformed lymphoblasts, and the complete coding
sequence of the COL11A2 gene was determined for 1 individual. This
identified a G-to-A transition, converting a glycyl to an arginyl codon,
within the triple-helical domain of the alpha-2(XI) chain. The change in
sequence eliminated an MspI restriction site. Affected children were
homozygous for the arginyl codon, while unaffected children were
homozygous for the glycyl codon; both parents were heterozygous for the
sequence change. The mutation occurred in a Gly-X-Y triplet. The
clinical findings in the 3 sibs with the gly175-to-arg missense mutation
were described by van Steensel et al. (1997).

.0003
STICKLER SYNDROME, TYPE III
COL11A2, 27-BP DEL

In a family with type III Stickler syndrome (184840), Sirko-Osadsa et
al. (1998) identified a 27-bp deletion within exon 39 of the COL11A2
gene.

.0004
WEISSENBACHER-ZWEYMULLER SYNDROME
OTOSPONDYLOMEGAEPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA, HETEROZYGOUS, INCLUDED
COL11A2, GLY955GLU

Weissenbacher and Zweymuller (1964) described a newborn boy of normal
size who presented with a 'combination of a Pierre Robin syndrome with a
fetal chondrodysplasia' (277610). The child had a markedly snub nose,
cleft palate, micrognathia, glossoptosis, rhizomelic shortness of the
limbs with dumbbell-shaped femora, and coronal vertebral clefts. A
follow-up report when the original WZS patient was 18 years old (Giedion
et al., 1982) indicated that he had developed sensorineural deafness at
about 5 years of age, and a spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia with enlarged
epiphyses of the long bones, radiologically most pronounced at the age
of 13.5 years. At age 18, he was normal in height (164 cm) and in
appearance except for slightly shorter limbs and lower segment. Also, he
had no ocular signs or symptoms. His parents were healthy and
nonconsanguineous. A brother was unaffected. Giedion et al. (1982)
reported 3 additional patients with the same condition and suggested
that they should be classified as otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia
(OSMED; 215150); common findings in patients of the OSMED group were
midface hypoplasia, cleft palate, micrognathia, sensorineural deafness,
normal eyes, and spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia with large epiphyses.
Pihlajamaa et al. (1998) analyzed the original WZS patient for mutations
in 2 collagen genes expressed in cartilage, COL2A1 and COL11A2. No
mutations were found in the COL2A1 gene but the COL11A2 gene contained a
G-to-A transition that converted codon 955 from an obligate glycine
(GGG) in the major triple helix of the protein to a codon for glutamate
(GAG). The mutation was present in heterozygous state.

.0005
DEAFNESS, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT 13
COL11A2, ARG549CYS

In affected members of an American family with autosomal dominant
nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss (DFNA13; 601868), McGuirt et al.
(1999) identified a heterozygous C-to-T missense mutation in exon 42
that predicted an arg549-to-cys amino acid substitution.

.0006
DEAFNESS, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT 13
COL11A2, GLY323GLU

In affected members of a Dutch family with autosomal dominant
nonsyndromic sensorineural deafness (DFNA13; 601868), McGuirt et al.
(1999) found a heterozygous G-to-A transition in exon 31 that predicted
a gly323-to-glu amino acid substitution.

.0007
OTOSPONDYLOMEGAEPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA
COL11A2, SER345TER

In a family from Morocco with consanguineous parents, Melkoniemi et al.
(2000) found that 3 children with OSMED (215150) were homozygous for a
C-to-A transversion at nucleotide 2492 in exon 33 of the COL11A2 gene,
resulting in a ser345-to-ter substitution. One of the children was
described as having normal body length at birth, but short limbs with
enlarged joints and stiff interphalangeal joints were noted. The
radiologic features included vertebral coronal clefts, square iliac
wings and a thick ischium, large metaphyses of the long bones, and
enlarged epiphyses of the elbows and knees. At age 7 years, she was of
nearly normal height, but disproportionate, and her palate was extremely
narrow, with a double row of teeth. Eye examination revealed slight
myopia.

.0008
STICKLER SYNDROME, TYPE III
COL11A2, ARG893TER

In affected members of a 3-generation family with type III Stickler
syndrome (184840), Vuoristo et al. (2004) identified a heterozygous
C-to-T transition in exon 57 of the COL11A2 gene, resulting in an
arg893-to-ter (R893X) substitution. The mutation induced skipping of
exon 57 in 1 allele, resulting in an in-frame deletion of 18 amino
acids. Sensorineural hearing loss was present in all 3 generations. The
propositus was a 4-year-old boy who had Robin sequence at birth. Both
the propositus and his father had a flat malar area and nasal bridge,
and the nose was upturned. The father had symptoms and radiologic
findings of osteoarthritis from the age of 29 years. At age 73 years,
the affected grandmother showed extensive osteoarthritic changes in the
spine. Her father had undergone hip replacement in midadulthood.

.0009
WEISSENBACHER-ZWEYMULLER SYNDROME, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
COL11A2, ARG845TER

In 5 individuals from a consanguineous Israeli Bedouin family with
autosomal recessive Weissenbacher-Zweymuller syndrome (277610), Harel et
al. (2005) identified homozygosity for a 3991C-T transition in exon 56
of the COL11A2 gene, resulting in an arg845-to-ter (R845X) substitution.
The R845X mutation was initially reported by Melkoniemi et al. (2000) in
compound heterozygous state in the offspring of nonconsanguineous
parents of northern European descent. The major differentiation between
WZS and otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia (OSMED; 215150) had been
proposed to be the 'catch-up growth' associated with the former, with a
definite diagnosis established also after follow-up. Given that
homozygous COL11A2 mutations causing OSMED have been identified
throughout the COL11A2 gene (Melkoniemi et al., 2000), it seems
improbable that one could define a specific region in the gene that,
when mutated, might cause WZS rather than OSMED. The R845X premature
translation termination mutation is in accordance with the mutations of
COL11A2 that are associated with OSMED, which are almost exclusively
frameshift or nonsense mutations that lead to the production of
truncated alpha-2 (XI) chains, unlikely to be incorporated into type XI
collagen molecules. Alternatively, these mutations may trigger
nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, and thus would be expected to be
functional nulls. Harel et al. (2005) concluded that autosomal recessive
WZS and OSMED are a single entity.

.0010
DEAFNESS, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 53
COL11A2, PRO621THR

In 5 affected members of 2 sibships of a consanguineous Iranian family
with nonsyndromic hearing loss (DFNB53; 609706), Chen et al. (2005)
identified homozygosity for an 1861C-A transversion in exon 21 of the
COL11A2 gene, resulting in a pro621-to-thr (P621T) substitution near the
N terminus of the triple helical region. The 4 parents and 1 sib were
heterozygous for the mutation.

.0011
OTOSPONDYLOMEGAEPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA
COL11A2, 1-BP DEL, 3962G

In an Egyptian brother and sister with OSMED (215150), Temtamy et al.
(2006) identified homozygosity for a 1-bp deletion (3962delG) in exon 55
of the COL11A2 gene, resulting in a termination codon in exon 56. The
first-cousin parents were heterozygous for the deletion; a younger
brother was unaffected.

.0012
FIBROCHONDROGENESIS 2
COL11A2, IVS18, 1-BP INS, +3

In a deceased infant with fibrochondrogenesis-2 (FBCG2; 614524), born of
consanguineous parents, Tompson et al. (2012) identified homozygosity
for a 1-bp insertion in intron 18 (+3insG) of the COL11A2 gene,
predicted to result in aberrant mRNA processing. The unaffected parents
were heterozygous for the mutation, as was an unaffected sib. An exon
trapping splicing assay in COS-7 cells demonstrated skipping of exon 18
in RNA from the mutant construct but not from the control.

.0013
FIBROCHONDROGENESIS 2
COL11A2, 9-BP DEL, NT2899

In a deceased infant with fibrochondrogenesis-2 (FBCG2; 614524), born of
healthy nonconsanguineous parents, Tompson et al. (2012) identified
heterozygosity for a de novo 9-bp deletion (2899_2907del9), predicted to
delete 3 amino acids within the triple helical domain. The mutation was
not present in the unaffected parents.

605532	TITLE *605532 SMAD-SPECIFIC E3 UBIQUITIN PROTEIN LIGASE 2; SMURF2
;;SMAD UBIQUITINATION REGULATORY FACTOR 2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ubiquitination controls various cellular functions by tagging proteins
for proteasomal degradation or incorporation into other regulatory
complexes. Central to this system are E3 ubiquitin ligases, which
function in the chain of reactions resulting in attachment of ubiquitin
moieties to substrate proteins. SMURF2 is a HECT domain E3 ubiquitin
ligase involved in degradation of SMADs (see 601595), TGF-beta receptor
(TGFBR; see 190181), and other substrates. SMURF2 also functions in
regulation of neuronal and planar cell polarity, induction of
senescence, and tumor suppression (summary by Blank et al., 2012).

CLONING

By searching sequence databases for proteins related to the E3 ubiquitin
ligase SMURF1 (605568), Kavsak et al. (2000) identified SMURF2, which
encodes a C2-WW-HECT domain ubiquitin ligase.

Using a similar strategy, Lin et al. (2000) independently cloned a cDNA
encoding SMURF2, a 748-amino acid ubiquitin E3 ligase that is 83%
identical to SMURF1.

MAPPING

Scott (2001) mapped the SMURF2 gene to chromosome 17q22-q23 based on
sequence similarity between the SMURF2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK
AF310676) and a genomic contig (GenBank GENBANK NT_010748).

GENE FUNCTION

Kavsak et al. (2000) found that SMURF2 associated constitutively with
SMAD7 (602932). SMURF2 was nuclear, but binding to SMAD7 induced export
and recruitment to activated TGFBR, where it caused degradation of
receptors and of SMAD7 via proteasomal and lysosomal pathways.
Gamma-interferon (IFNG; 147570), which stimulates expression of SMAD7,
induced SMAD7-SMURF2 complex formation and increased TGFBR turnover,
which was stabilized by blocking SMAD7 or SMURF2 expression.
Furthermore, SMAD7 mutants that interfered with recruitment of SMURF2 to
the receptors were compromised in their inhibitory activity. These
studies defined SMAD7 as an adaptor in an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex
that targets TGFBR for degradation.

Using yeast 2-hybrid assays and GST fusion-binding analysis, Lin et al.
(2000) found a strong interaction of the second and third SMURF2 WW
domains with the receptor-activated SMAD1 (601595), SMAD2 (601366), and
SMAD3 (603109), but not the common SMAD4 (600993). Western blot analysis
showed that SMURF2 selectively regulated the expression of SMAD2 and, to
some extent, SMAD1, but not SMAD3, through a ubiquitination- and
proteasome-dependent degradation process catalyzed by the HECT ligase.
Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis determined that the
SMURF2/phosphorylated SMAD2 interaction was dependent on the presence of
TGFB1 (190180) and occurred in the nucleus. Reporter assay analysis
indicated that SMURF2 decreased SMAD2-dependent transcription.

Using protein pull-down and immunoprecipitation assays, Subramaniam et
al. (2003) found that RNF11 (612598) interacted with SMURF2, leading to
ubiquitination of both proteins. The interaction required the PY motif
of RNF11 and WW domains 2 and 3 of SMURF2. RNF11 also interacted with
the ubiquitin-conjugating protein UBCH5 (UBE2D1; 602961), but not with
UBC3 (CDC34; 116948), and ubiquitination of RNF11 by SMURF2 required the
PY motif. SMURF2 represses TGF-beta signaling, and Subramaniam et al.
(2003) showed that RNF11 relieved SMURF2-mediated transcriptional
inhibition of a TGF-beta-responsive promoter in reporter gene assays.

Using RNF11 as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human ovary cDNA
library, Li and Seth (2004) showed that human RNF11 interacted with
several proteins, including AMSH (STAMBP; 606247). AMSH was
ubiquitinated by SMURF2 in the presence of RNF11, and reduction in the
steady-state level of AMSH required both RNF11 and SMURF2. Li and Seth
(2004) concluded that RNF11 recruits AMSH to SMURF2 for ubiquitination,
leading to its degradation by the 26S proteasome.

Zhang and Cohen (2004) found that telomere attrition in human
fibroblasts induced SMURF2 upregulation, and this upregulation was
sufficient to produce the senescence phenotype. Infection of early
passage fibroblasts with retrovirus carrying SMURF2 led to morphologic
and biochemical alterations characteristic of senescence, including
altered gene expression and reversal of cellular immortalization by TERT
(187270). Senescence induction occurred in the absence of detectable DNA
damage or stress response and was independent of the E3 ligase activity
of SMURF2. Zhang and Cohen (2004) showed that SMURF2 activated
senescence through the RB1 (614041) and p53 (TP53; 191170) pathways.

Blank et al. (2012) found that knockdown of SMURF2 in human tumor cell
lines resulted in increased levels of RNF20 protein (607699) and
ubiquitination of the RNF20 substrate histone H2B (see 609904), similar
to findings in Smurf2 -/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (see ANIMAL
MODEL). Knockdown of RNF20 increased chromatin compaction.
Immunohistochemical analysis of 40 breast cancer tissues and 55
lymphomas and matched adjacent normal tissue showed that tumor formation
was associated with low SMURF2 expression and high RNF20 expression.
Blank et al. (2012) concluded that SMURF2 is directly involved in
regulation of the DNA damage response by directing polyubiquitination
and proteasomal degradation of RNF20.

ANIMAL MODEL

Blank et al. (2012) found that Smurf2 -/- mice appeared normal at birth
and early in adulthood; however, a large number of them developed tumors
of all types with age. Smurf2 -/- MEFs proliferated more rapidly than
wildtype at all stages. In later passages, Smurf2 -/- MEFs lost contact
inhibition, showed evidence of DNA damage, and readily induced tumors
following injection into nude mice. Smurf2 -/- MEFs also showed elevated
protein level, but not mRNA level, of Rnf20, which was associated with
relaxed chromatin compaction and elevated ubiquitination of H2B. In
wildtype cells, but not Smurf2 -/- cells, proteasome inhibition elevated
Rnf20 protein content. Knockdown of Rnf20 in Smurf2 -/- cells retarded
cell growth and oncogenic transformation and reduced the amount of
ubiquitinated H2B.

607648	TITLE *607648 SERINE/THREONINE PROTEIN KINASE 39; STK39
;;STE20/SPS1-RELATED PROLINE- AND ALANINE-RICH KINASE; SPAK
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database analysis, Johnston et al. (2000) identified a kinase domain
fragment of STK39, which they called SPAK, based on its homology with
the STE20 (STK25; 602255) family of kinases. They used this fragment to
clone full-length STK39 from a brain cDNA library. The deduced 547-amino
acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 59.6 kD. STK39 contains
an N-terminal series of proline and alanine repeats (PAPA box), followed
by a serine/threonine kinase catalytic domain, a nuclear localization
signal, a consensus caspase cleavage recognition motif, and a C-terminal
region. Northern blot analysis detected ubiquitous expression of a
3.8-kb transcript, with most abundant expression in brain and pancreas.
Western blot analysis of mouse tissues detected a protein of about 60 kD
in all tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Johnston et al. (2000) characterized human and murine STK39 and
confirmed that the recombinant protein is a serine/threonine kinase that
can phosphorylate itself and an exogenous substrate in vitro. STK39
immunoprecipitated from transfected mammalian cells in a complex with
another serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylated catalytically
inactive STK39. STK39 activated the p38 MAP kinase (600289) pathway in
cotransfection assays. Full-length STK39 was expressed in the cytoplasm
in transfected cells, while a mutant corresponding to caspase-cleaved
STK39 localized predominantly in the nucleus.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the STK39
gene to chromosome 2 (TMAP stSG52257).

614425	TITLE *614425 TELO2-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1; TTI1
;;KIAA0406
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Ishikawa et al. (1997) obtained a partial TTI1 clone, which
they designated KIAA0406. The transcript contains repetitive elements in
its 3-prime end. RT-PCR analysis revealed ubiquitous TTI1 expression.

Using RNA interference to identify genes involved in resistance to
ionizing radiation in U2OS human osteosarcoma cells, Hurov et al. (2010)
identified TTI1. The deduced protein contains 1,089 amino acids, and is
highly conserved, with orthologs in mouse, chicken, fly, frog, fish,
plants, and yeast.

GENE FUNCTION

Using RNA interference experiments with U2OS cells, Hurov et al. (2010)
found that TTI1 and TTI2 (614426) were required for resistance to
ionizing radiation and other DNA-damaging agents. Cells depleted of TTI1
or TTI2 were unable to efficiently arrest in G2 in response to ionizing
radiation, showed defective DNA damage response signaling, and were
unable to maintain abundance of phosphoinositide-3-kinase-related
protein kinases (PIKKs), notably ATM (607585) and MTOR (FRAP1; 601231).
Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that TTI1 associated with PIKKs,
and both TTI1 and TTI2 associated with TEL2 (TELO2; 611140) in a complex
of about 2 million daltons, which they called the TTT complex. All 3 TTT
complex components were required for stabilization of PIKKs and
resistance to DNA damage. Hurov et al. (2010) proposed that the TTT
complex may participate in proper folding of newly synthesized PIKKs.

Takai et al. (2010) found that PIKKs depended on HSP90 (see 140571) and
the TEL2-TTI1-TTI2 complex for their maturation. In vivo labeling showed
that PIKKs bound TEL2 soon after their synthesis in a manner that
depended on HSP90. Knockout of Tel2 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts
(MEFs) or pharmacologic inhibition of HSP90 in human cells impaired
formation of 3 PIKK complexes: TORC1, which contains MTOR, GBL (MLST8;
612190), and RAPTOR (RPTOR; 607130); TORC2, which contains MTOR, GBL,
and RICTOR (609022); and ATM-ATRIP (606605). Once mature, the PIKK
complexes no longer associated with the TEL2-TTI1-TTI2 complex.
Tel2-mutants defective in binding Tti1 and Tti2 were impaired in their
ability to rescue the growth and checkpoint defects in Tel2-knockout
MEFs. Takai et al. (2010) concluded that the TEL2-TTI1-TTI2 complex is
required for assembly of MTOR and ATR with their respective partners.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1997) mapped the TTI1
gene to chromosome 20.

Hartz (2012) mapped the TTI1 gene to chromosome 20q11.23 based on an
alignment of the TTI1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB007866) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

609385	TITLE *609385 DEAD END, ZEBRAFISH, HOMOLOG OF, 1; DND1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Weidinger et al. (2003) cloned zebrafish Dnd1, encoding a putative
RNA-binding protein expressed specifically in primordial germ cells
(PGCs) throughout embryogenesis and localized to perinuclear germ
granules within PGCs. By database analysis, Weidinger et al. (2003)
identified human DND1. The deduced 353-amino acid protein contains a
single-strand RNA-binding domain in the N-terminus and shares 34%
sequence identity with zebrafish Dnd1.

GENE FUNCTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short noncoding RNAs that bind to complementary
sequences in the 3-prime UTRs of target mRNAs and inhibit their
expression. Kedde et al. (2007) showed that the expression of DND1
counteracted the inhibitory effect of several miRNAs in human cells and
in primordial germ cells of zebrafish by preventing the association of
miRNAs with their target mRNAs. Kedde et al. (2007) detailed the effect
of DND1 on the downregulation of p27 mRNA (CDKN1B; 600778) by miR221
(MIRN221; 300568) in human cells. Introduction of DND1 abolished the
interaction between miR221 and the 3-prime UTR of p27 mRNA and countered
the downregulation of p27 expression by miR221. DND1 bound a
uridine-rich region in the 3-prime UTR of p27 mRNA that is near the
miR221-binding site and prevented miR221 binding. At least 1 of the 2
uridine-rich regions in the p27 3-prime UTR and the RNA-binding domain
of DND1 were required to rescue p27 expression.

MAPPING

Hartz (2005) mapped the DND1 gene to chromosome 5q31.3 based on an
alignment of the DND1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AY321065) with the
genomic sequence.

ANIMAL MODEL

Weidinger et al. (2003) found that knockdown of Dnd1 in zebrafish
blocked confinement of the PGCs to the deep blastoderm shortly after
their specification and resulted in failure of PGCs to exhibit motile
behavior and to migrate actively. PGCs subsequently died, but somatic
development was not affected.

Stevens (1973) reported the Ter mutation in an inbred line of mice with
a high incidence of spontaneous congenital testicular teratoma (273300).
Noguchi and Noguchi (1985) found that Ter is a recessive mutation
causing germ cell deficiency and a high incidence of congenital
testicular teratoma in 129-Ter/Ter mice. Sakurai et al. (1995) showed
that the Ter mutation first causes primordial germ cell deficiency in
Ter/Ter mouse embryos at 8 days' gestation. Youngren et al. (2005)
reported the positional cloning of Ter, revealing a point mutation that
introduces a termination codon in the mouse Dnd1 gene. PGC deficiency
was corrected both with BACs containing Dnd1 and with a Dnd1-encoding
transgene. Dnd1 is expressed in fetal gonads during the critical period
when testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT) originate. Dnd1 has an RNA
recognition motif and is most similar to the apobec (see 600130)
complementation factor, a component of the cytidine to uridine RNA
editing complex. These results suggested that Ter may adversely affect
essential aspects of RNA biology during PGC development. Youngren et al.
(2005) stated that Dnd1 was the first protein known to have an RNA
recognition motif directly implicated as a heritable cause of
spontaneous tumorigenesis, and they suggested that TGCT development in
the 129-Ter mouse strain models pediatric TGCTs in humans.

608383	TITLE *608383 DIHYDROPYRIMIDINASE-LIKE 5; DPYSL5
;;COLLAPSIN RESPONSE MEDIATOR PROTEIN 5; CRMP5;;
CRMP3-ASSOCIATED MOLECULE; CRAM;;
ULIP6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the CRMP family, such as DPYSL5, are believed to play a role
in growth cone guidance during neural development.

CLONING

Using chicken Crmp3 as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen, Fukada et al.
(2000) cloned mouse Crmp5. The deduced 564-amino acid protein contains
several consensus phosphorylation sites. It shares about 51% amino acid
identity with mouse Dpys (222748) and 49 to 50% identity with other
Crmps. Northern blot analysis of several mouse tissues detected a
transcript of about 5.0 kb only in brain. During development, Crmp5 was
expressed before embryonic day 11. Expression peaked in the first
postnatal week and declined in the second week.

Inatome et al. (2000) cloned Cram from rat brain. The deduced protein
contains 2 central WD repeats, as well as several consensus
phosphorylation sites. It shares 57% amino acid identity with rat Dpys
and about 50% identity with other Crmps. Cram mRNA became detectable in
the brains of embryonic rats at embryonic day 14. Expression increased
until postnatal day 1, then decreased to very low levels in adult rat
brains.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the DPYSL5
gene to chromosome 2 (TMAP WI-18667). By FISH, Fukada et al. (2000)
mapped the mouse Dpysl5 gene to chromosome 5B1.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis and coimmunoprecipitation assays, Fukada et
al. (2000) showed that mouse Crmp5 interacted with Dpys and several
other Crmps, including itself, but not with Crmp1 (602462).

Inatome et al. (2000) found that Cram expression was increased in rat
adrenal chromaffin cells induced to differentiate into neurons by NGF
(162030). Cram was detected in high molecular mass complexes containing
Crmp3, and it coimmunoprecipitated with proteins having protein tyrosine
kinase activity.

Neurologic manifestations of paraneoplastic syndromes reflect antitumor
immune responses initiated by neuron and muscle autoantigens expressed
by cancer cells. Multiple other autoantibodies associated with
paraneoplastic syndromes have been identified, including anti-Yo (see
302650 and 117340) and anti-Hu (see 603458 and 168360). Yu et al. (2001)
defined a paraneoplastic IgG autoantibody specific for CRMP5, which is
expressed in adult central and peripheral neurons and in small-cell lung
carcinomas. CRMP5-IgG was detected in 121 of approximately 68,000
patients suspected to have a paraneoplastic syndrome. Clinical features
included chorea (11%), cranial neuropathy (17%), peripheral neuropathy
(47%), autonomic neuropathy (31%), cerebellar ataxia (26%), subacute
dementia (25%), and neuromuscular junction disorders (12%). Lung
carcinoma, mostly small-cell, was found in 77% of patients; thymoma was
in 6%. Serum IgG in all cases bound to recombinant CRMP5, but not to
CRMP2 (602463) or CRMP3. Cross et al. (2003) reported 16 patients with
CRMP5-IgG antibodies who had optic neuritis, 5 of whom had coexisting
retinitis. Fifteen of the patients had subacute vision loss, swollen

cytotoxic T cells, were present. All patients had other neurologic
symptoms or signs at some point in their illness.

608383	TITLE *608383 DIHYDROPYRIMIDINASE-LIKE 5; DPYSL5
;;COLLAPSIN RESPONSE MEDIATOR PROTEIN 5; CRMP5;;
CRMP3-ASSOCIATED MOLECULE; CRAM;;
ULIP6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the CRMP family, such as DPYSL5, are believed to play a role
in growth cone guidance during neural development.

CLONING

Using chicken Crmp3 as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen, Fukada et al.
(2000) cloned mouse Crmp5. The deduced 564-amino acid protein contains
several consensus phosphorylation sites. It shares about 51% amino acid
identity with mouse Dpys (222748) and 49 to 50% identity with other
Crmps. Northern blot analysis of several mouse tissues detected a
transcript of about 5.0 kb only in brain. During development, Crmp5 was
expressed before embryonic day 11. Expression peaked in the first
postnatal week and declined in the second week.

Inatome et al. (2000) cloned Cram from rat brain. The deduced protein
contains 2 central WD repeats, as well as several consensus
phosphorylation sites. It shares 57% amino acid identity with rat Dpys
and about 50% identity with other Crmps. Cram mRNA became detectable in
the brains of embryonic rats at embryonic day 14. Expression increased
until postnatal day 1, then decreased to very low levels in adult rat
brains.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the DPYSL5
gene to chromosome 2 (TMAP WI-18667). By FISH, Fukada et al. (2000)
mapped the mouse Dpysl5 gene to chromosome 5B1.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis and coimmunoprecipitation assays, Fukada et
al. (2000) showed that mouse Crmp5 interacted with Dpys and several
other Crmps, including itself, but not with Crmp1 (602462).

Inatome et al. (2000) found that Cram expression was increased in rat
adrenal chromaffin cells induced to differentiate into neurons by NGF
(162030). Cram was detected in high molecular mass complexes containing
Crmp3, and it coimmunoprecipitated with proteins having protein tyrosine
kinase activity.

Neurologic manifestations of paraneoplastic syndromes reflect antitumor
immune responses initiated by neuron and muscle autoantigens expressed
by cancer cells. Multiple other autoantibodies associated with
paraneoplastic syndromes have been identified, including anti-Yo (see
302650 and 117340) and anti-Hu (see 603458 and 168360). Yu et al. (2001)
defined a paraneoplastic IgG autoantibody specific for CRMP5, which is
expressed in adult central and peripheral neurons and in small-cell lung
carcinomas. CRMP5-IgG was detected in 121 of approximately 68,000
patients suspected to have a paraneoplastic syndrome. Clinical features
included chorea (11%), cranial neuropathy (17%), peripheral neuropathy
(47%), autonomic neuropathy (31%), cerebellar ataxia (26%), subacute
dementia (25%), and neuromuscular junction disorders (12%). Lung
carcinoma, mostly small-cell, was found in 77% of patients; thymoma was
in 6%. Serum IgG in all cases bound to recombinant CRMP5, but not to
CRMP2 (602463) or CRMP3. Cross et al. (2003) reported 16 patients with
CRMP5-IgG antibodies who had optic neuritis, 5 of whom had coexisting
retinitis. Fifteen of the patients had subacute vision loss, swollen
optic discs, and field defects. Vitreous inflammatory cells, primarily
cytotoxic T cells, were present. All patients had other neurologic
symptoms or signs at some point in their illness.

601961	TITLE *601961 PROTEIN ARGININE N-METHYLTRANSFERASE 2; PRMT2
;;HETEROGENEOUS NUCLEAR RIBONUCLEOPROTEIN METHYLTRANSFERASE 1-LIKE 1;
HRMT1L1;;
HMT1-LIKE 1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Katsanis et al. (1997) isolated HRMT1L1, a novel transcript from
chromosome 21 similar to the rat protein arginine N-methyltransferase-1
gene (PRMT1; 602950) reported by Lin et al. (1996). Katsanis et al.
(1997) found that HRMT1L1 was expressed in all tissues they
investigated.

Scott et al. (1998) further characterized HRMT1L1 and HRMT1L2. By
Northern blot analysis, they found that HRMT1L1 is expressed as a 2.4-kb
transcript in various adult and fetal tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Katsanis et al. (1997) noted that the function of protein
methyltransferases is posttranslational methylation of arginine
residues. Two types of activity had been described, attributed to
different classes of enzymes. One methylates myelin protein zero (MPZ;
159440); the other was originally thought to methylate histones, but was
later found to methylate hnRNPs far more efficiently. The authors
suggested that HRMT1L1, a human homolog of yeast RMT1, associates with
hnRNPs.

Scott et al. (1998) found that HRMT1L1 could not methylate HNRNPA1
(164017) or any other tested substrate in vitro, and did not complement
a yeast arginine methyltransferase mutant strain.

MAPPING

Katsanis et al. (1997) mapped the PRMT2 gene to chromosome 21 by study
of monochromosomal cell hybrids and fine mapped the gene by PCR analysis
of a partial chromosome 21 hybrid panel to a telomeric position on
21q22.3. Hybridization to a YAC that was positive for S100B (176990)
indicated that PRMT2 is no more than 10 kb from S100B. S100B was the
most telomeric chromosome 21 gene known at that time.

609426	TITLE *609426 MISSHAPEN/NIK-RELATED KINASE 1; MINK1
;;MINK
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MINK1 belongs to the germinal center kinase (GCK) family. GCKs regulate
a wide variety of cellular processes by coupling cell surface receptors
to mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, such as the JNK
pathway (see 601158) (Hu et al., 2004).

CLONING

Dan et al. (2000) cloned mouse Mink based on its upregulated expression
during postnatal cerebral development. The deduced protein contains
1,300 amino acids and has a calculated molecular mass of 146 kD. Mink
has an N-terminal kinase domain, an intermediate region, and a
C-terminal GCK homology domain. The intermediate region of Mink contains
2 glutamine-rich motifs and 8 proline-rich motifs, which are putative
SH3 domain-binding regions. Mink is highly homologous to several group I
GCKs, including NIK (MAP3K14; 604655) and its Drosophila homolog,
Misshapen. By searching sequence databases, Dan et al. (2000) identified
human MINK, which encodes a predicted 1,296-amino acid protein that
shares 97% identity and a similar structure with the mouse protein.
Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues detected abundant expression in
brain, with lower levels in kidney, spleen, and heart. Longer exposure
showed expression in all tissues tested.

By screening a Jurkat cDNA library for genes conferring resistance to
Taxol-induced cell death, Hu et al. (2004) identified an antisense
fragment of human MINK1. They screened a HeLa cell cDNA library using
the fragment as probe and obtained a full-length MINK1 splice variant
that they termed MINK1-beta. The predicted 1,312-amino acid human
MINK1-beta protein and its mouse homolog share 98% identity in the
N-terminal kinase and C-terminal citron (605629) homology domains. Their
intermediate domains share at least 80% sequence similarity. RT-PCR
analysis identified 5 alternatively spliced variants of MINK1, including
MINK1-beta. The longest isoform, MINK1-alpha, contains 1,332 amino
acids. The other variants encode proteins that vary in their
intermediate domains. Northern blot analysis, which did not distinguish
between the variants, revealed ubiquitous expression of MINK1, with
highest levels in brain, skeletal muscle, pancreas, and testis. RT-PCR
analysis showed that the MINK1 variants have distinct expression
patterns. MINK1-alpha was expressed ubiquitously, with higher levels in
most tissues than the other variants. MINK1-gamma was predominantly
expressed in brain, and MINK1-delta was most abundant in skeletal
muscle. MINK1-beta and MINK1-epsilon were expressed as minor forms in
almost every tissue tested.

GENE FUNCTION

Dan et al. (2000) found that mouse Mink activated the JNK and p38 (see
600289) pathways.

Using kinase assays, Hu et al. (2004) found that MINK1-beta
phosphorylated myelin basic protein (MBP; 159430), as well as itself,
and activated the JNK pathway independently of its kinase activity.
MINK1-beta did not activate the ERK (e.g., MAPK1; 176948) and p38
pathways. Yeast 2-hybrid and GST pull-down assays showed that MINK1-beta
associated with the SH3 domain of NCK (NCK1; 600508). Fluorescence
microscopy demonstrated that MINK1-beta was involved in modulating cell
morphology, possibly through its effects on actin organization and cell
adhesion to the extracellular matrix. MINK1-beta appeared to be
associated with the Golgi apparatus.

McCarty et al. (2005) noted that thymocytes that engage MHC-self peptide
complexes with intermediate affinity are expanded in the thymus through
a process of positive selection, whereas those that bind to these
complexes with high affinity are eliminated through a process of
negative selection. They demonstrated that MINK1 is an essential
signaling element that couples the T-cell receptor to negative, but not
positive, selection.

GENE STRUCTURE

Dan et al. (2000) determined that the MINK1 gene covers more than 63 kb
of genomic DNA and contains 31 exons.

Dan et al. (2002) found that the terminal exons of the MINK1 and CHRNE
(100725) genes overlap in a tail-to-tail manner on opposite DNA strands
in hominoid genomes, but not in the mouse. They suggested that the
potentially hazardous mutations responsible for the exon overlap managed
to escape evolutionary pressures by differential temporospatial
expression of the 2 genes.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Dan et al. (2002) mapped the MINK1 gene to
chromosome 17p13.1.

611248	TITLE *611248 KELCH DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 3; KLHDC3
;;PEAS
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening a mouse genomic library using mouse Mea1 (143170) as probe,
followed by database analysis, RT-PCR, and RACE, Ohinata et al. (2003)
cloned mouse and human KLHDC3 genomic cDNAs, which they called PEAS. The
deduced 382-amino acid human protein has a calculated molecular mass of
about 43 kD, and it contains an N-terminal region with 6 tandem repeat
kelch motifs (see KLHL1, 605332), predicted to form a beta-propeller
structure, and a relatively hydrophobic C-terminal region. Human and
mouse KLHDC3 proteins share similarity to RAG2 (179616). Northern blot
analysis of mouse tissues detected expression primarily in testis. In
situ hybridization of mouse testis localized expression in pachytene
spermatocytes and spermatids. Immunohistochemical studies detected mouse
protein primarily to pachytene spermatocytes where Klhdc3 localized to
both the cytoplasm and nucleus. Ohinata et al. (2003) stated that within
the nucleus mouse Klhdc3 had a granular distribution and localized to
meiotic chromatin.

GENE FUNCTION

Ohinata et al. (2003) demonstrated retinoic acid induction of
transcription of mouse Peas and Mea1 and concluded that Peas and Mea1
are transcribed from a shared bidirectional promoter.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ohinata et al. (2003) showed that both human and mouse KLHDC3 overlap in
a head-to-head orientation with MEA1 and that the 2 genes share a
GC-rich bidirectional promoter spanning roughly 1 kb. They determined
that KLHDC3, MEA1, and PPP2R5D (601646) form an overlapping gene
complex, which they called the PEAS-MEA1-PPP2R5D (PMP) gene complex.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Ohinata et al. (2003) mapped the KLHDC3
gene to chromosome 6p21.1. They mapped the mouse Klhdc3 gene to mouse
chromosome 17.

;;TETRATRICOPEPTIDE REPEAT DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 15; TTC15
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TRAPPC12 is a component of the TRAPP multisubunit tethering complex
involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking (Scrivens et al., 2011).

CLONING

Using tandem affinity purification followed by SDS-PAGE and mass
spectrometry to identify proteins that copurified with TRAPPC2 (300202)
and TRAPPC2L (610970) from HEK293 cells, Scrivens et al. (2011)
identified TRAPPC12. The deduced protein contains 4 tetratricopeptide
repeats of about 34 amino acids each. TRAPPC12 had an apparent molecular
mass of 79 kD by SDS-PAGE.

GENE FUNCTION

Scrivens et al. (2011) found that depletion of TRAPPC12 in HeLa cells
via interfering RNA resulted in Golgi fragmentation into dispersed
punctae and arrested anterograde trafficking, suggesting that TRAPPC12
is involved in an early trafficking event between the endoplasmic
reticulum and Golgi.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the TRAPPC12 gene to chromosome 2p25.3 based on an
alignment of the TRAPPC12 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF151845) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

610736	TITLE *610736 ANKYRIN REPEAT DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 23; ANKRD23
;;DIABETES-RELATED ANKYRIN REPEAT PROTEIN; DARP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ANKRD23 belongs to the conserved muscle ankyrin repeat protein (MARP)
family. Expression of MARPs is induced in response to physiologic
stress, injury, and hypertrophy (Miller et al., 2003).

CLONING

By RT-PCR of skeletal muscle total RNA using primers based on mouse
Darp, Ikeda et al. (2003) cloned human ANKRD23, which they called DARP.
The deduced 305-amino acid protein has an N-terminal nuclear
localization signal and 4 C-terminal ankyrin repeats. Northern blot
analysis of adult mouse tissues detected abundant expression of Darp in
skeletal muscle, with slightly lower levels in heart and brown adipose
tissue. Darp was not expressed in other tissues examined. Chinese
hamster ovary cells expressed epitope-tagged Darp in both nuclear and
cytoplasmic fractions.

Using the N2A region of titin (TTN; 188840) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid
screen of a skeletal muscle cDNA library, Miller et al. (2003) cloned
DARP. The deduced 305-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass
of 34 kD. Northern blot analysis detected DARP expression in skeletal
and cardiac muscle. Western blot analysis revealed 55- and 60-kD DARP
proteins in heart and a 34-kD DARP protein in skeletal muscle. By
database analysis, Miller et al. (2003) identified an N-terminally
extended Darp isoform in rat derived from an alternate upstream ATG
start codon. Immunofluorescence microscopy localized Darp in fetal rat
cardiac myocytes in cell junctions, within nuclei, and in faint
striations on some myofibrils. Darp was present in intercalated discs in
adult rat heart. Fluorescence-tagged Darp targeted to the I-band region
and colocalized with N2A in fetal mouse cardiac myocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

Ikeda et al. (2003) found that expression of Darp was upregulated in the
heart of the KKA(y) mouse, a type-2 diabetes (125853) and insulin
resistance model. Darp expression was also altered in the
insulin-resistant Zucker rat. Expression of mouse Darp in Chinese
hamster ovary cells resulted in significantly decreased palmitate
uptake. Furthermore, Darp expression was altered by changes of energy
supply induced by excess fatty acid treatment of skeletal myotubes in
vitro and in fasting mice in vivo. Ikeda et al. (2003) concluded that
DARP is a nuclear protein involved in energy metabolism.

By mutation analysis, Miller et al. (2003) determined that a portion of
ankyrin repeat-2 of DARP bound the N2A region of titin between
immunoglobulin repeats 80 and 81. Expression of Darp was upregulated in
response to stretch on myofibrils, within nuclei, and at cell junctions
in most cultured fetal rat cardiac myocytes examined.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Ikeda et al. (2003) mapped the ANKRD23
gene to chromosome 2p11.1-q11.1.

;;CALCIUM CHANNEL, L TYPE, ALPHA-1 POLYPEPTIDE, ISOFORM 4; CACNL1A4;;
CaV2.1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The CACNA1A gene encodes the transmembrane pore-forming subunit of the
P/Q-type or CaV2.1 voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) (Kordasiewicz et
al., 2006). Voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels not only mediate the entry
of Ca(2+) ions into excitable cells but are also involved in a variety
of Ca(2+)-dependent processes, including muscle contraction, hormone or
neurotransmitter release, and gene expression. Diriong et al. (1995)
noted that calcium channels are multisubunit complexes and that the
channel activity is directed by a pore-forming alpha-1 subunit, which is
often sufficient to generate voltage-sensitive Ca(2+) channel activity.
There are at least 6 classes of alpha-1 subunits: alpha-1A, B, C, D, E,
and S, which are derived from 6 genes representing members of a gene
family. The auxiliary subunits beta (e.g., 114207), alpha-2/delta, and
gamma (e.g., 114209) regulate channel activity.

CLONING

Ophoff et al. (1996) characterized the CACNL1A4 gene and reported the
amino acid sequence for residues 1-2262 of the protein. Northern
analysis detected a 9.8-kb transcript in cerebellum, cerebral cortex,
thalamus, and hypothalamus.

Kordasiewicz et al. (2006) showed that a 75-kD human polypeptide
consisting of C terminus of CACNA1A is cleaved from the full-length
protein and is present in the nucleus of HEK293 cells, as well as in
mouse and human cerebellar Purkinje cells. Nuclear translocation
depended partly on the presence of 3 nuclear localization signals within
the C terminus.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ophoff et al. (1996) characterized the CACNL1A4 gene in preparation for
a mutation search in neurologic disorders that map to 19p13. They found
that the gene covers 300 kb with 47 exons. Sequencing of all exons and
their surroundings revealed polymorphic variations, including a
(CA)n-repeat (D19S1150) and a (CAG)n-repeat in the 3-prime-UTR.

Trettel et al. (2000) determined that the CACNL1A4 gene is alternatively
spliced. A second isoform contains an alternative exon 37 that differs
from the first by 97 nucleotides.

MAPPING

By FISH, Diriong et al. (1995) assigned the CACNA1A gene to chromosome
19p13.

GENE FUNCTION

Ca(2+) currents have been described on the basis of their biophysical
and pharmacologic properties and include L-, N-, T-, P-, Q-, and R-
types. The distinctive properties of these Ca(2+) channel types are
related primarily to the expression of a variety of alpha-1 isoforms
(Dunlap et al., 1995). The alpha-1A isoform is abundantly expressed in
neuronal tissue and corresponds to the P/Q Ca(2+) channel type. The B
and E isoforms are also expressed in neuronal tissue and correspond to
the N-type and R-type of Ca(2+) channels, respectively (Lehmann-Horn and
Jurkat-Rott, 1999). The genes encoding the alpha-1A, B, and E isoforms
are symbolized CACNL1A4 or CACNA1A, CACNL1A5 (601012), and CACNL1A6
(601013) and are located on 19p13, 9q34 and 1q25-q31, respectively
(Diriong et al., 1995).

Alpha-1C, D, and S are involved with L-type Ca(2+) channels and are
referred to as cardiac, neuroendocrine/brain, and skeletal muscle
isoforms, respectively. They are encoded, respectively, by the CACNL1A1
gene (114205) on 12p13.3, the CACNL1A2 gene (114206) on 3p14.3, and the
CACNL1A3 gene (114208) on 1q31-q32.

Takamori et al. (1997) and Takamori (2004) presented evidence suggesting
that the alpha-1A subunit of the P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channel
contains antigenic sites implicated in Lambert-Eaton myasthenic
syndrome.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Nishimune et al. (2004) showed that laminin beta-2 (150325), a component
of the synaptic cleft at the neuromuscular junction, binds directly to
calcium channels that are required for neurotransmitter release from
motor nerve terminals. This interaction leads to clustering of channels
which in turn recruit other presynaptic components. Perturbation of this
interaction in vivo results in disassembly of neurotransmitter release
sites, resembling defects previously observed in an autoimmune
neuromuscular disorder, Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (600003).
Nishimune et al. (2004) concluded that their results identify an
extracellular ligand of the voltage-gated calcium channel as well as a
new laminin receptor, suggest a model for the development of nerve
terminals, and provide clues to the pathogenesis of a synaptic disease.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Episodic Ataxia Type 2

In 2 unrelated patients with episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2; 108500),
Ophoff et al. (1996) identified 2 mutations in the CACNA1A gene
resulting in a disrupted reading frame. The first of these was deletion
of a single C, nucleotide 4073 in codon 1266 (601011.0005), leading to a
frameshift in the putative translation product with a stop codon in the
next exon (codon 1294). See also 601011.0006.

Eunson et al. (2005) identified 2 splice site mutations in the CACNA1A
gene in 2 unrelated families with EA2.

Riant et al. (2010) identified 4 different exonic deletions in the
CACNA1A gene in 4 (14%) of 27 patients with episodic ataxia, in whom
sequencing analysis was negative for CACNA1A point mutations. The EA2
phenotype in the patients with deletion was similar to that of patients
with point mutations. The findings indicated that screening for
deletions in the CACNA1A gene should also be done for a complete genetic
workup.

Labrum et al. (2009) used multiplex ligation-dependent probe
amplification (MLPA) to screen for large-scale genetic rearrangements in
CACNA1A in 53 patients with a clinical diagnosis of episodic ataxia type
2 (EA2; 108500) or familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 (FHM1; 141500) in
whom sequencing analysis was negative for CACNA1A point mutations.
Labrum et al. (2009) identified 5 previously unreported large-scale
deletions in the CACNA1A gene in 6 families with EA2 and the first
pathogenic duplication in CACNA1A in an index patient with isolated
episodic diplopia without ataxia (601011.0030) whose father reportedly
had typical EA2 (601011.0030). Labrum et al. (2009) suggested that
large-scale deletions and duplications can cause CACNA1A-associated
channelopathies and that screening for large-scale rearrangements by
rapid techniques such as MLPA should be considered as a first-line
approach for genetic diagnostic testing of CACNA1A-associated
channelopathies.

- Familial Hemiplegic Migraine

In 5 unrelated families with familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM; 141500),
Ophoff et al. (1996) identified 4 different missense mutations in the
CACNA1A gene (601011.0001-601011.0004). The authors raised the
possibility that a similar defect may be involved in common types of
migraine. Based on their mutational findings, Ophoff et al. (1996)
suggested that FHM and EA2 are allelic channelopathies.

To determine the pathophysiologic consequences of missense mutations in
the pore-forming human alpha-1A subunit of neuronal P/Q-type calcium
channels associated with FHM, Kraus et al. (1998) introduced 4 single
mutations (R192Q, 601011.0001; T666M, 601011.0002; V714A, 601011.0003;
and I1811L, 601011.0004) into alpha-1A and investigated possible changes
in channel function after functional expression of mutant subunits in
Xenopus laevis oocytes. Changes in channel gating were observed for
mutants T666M, V714A, and I1811L, but not for R192Q. Barium current
inactivation was slightly faster in mutants T666M and V714A than in
wildtype. The time course of recovery from channel inactivation was
slower than in wildtype in T666M and accelerated in V714A and I1811L.
Kraus et al. (1998) concluded that 3 of the 4 FHM mutations, located at
the putative channel pore, alter inactivation gating and provide a
pathophysiologic basis for the postulated neuronal instability in
patients with FHM.

Kraus et al. (2000) continued their channel function studies with 3
additional mutations associated with FHM, including D715E (601011.0010)
and V1457L (601011.0019). All 3 mutations significantly shifted the
voltage dependence of activation to more negative potentials, resulting
in altered calcium signaling by increasing channel activity at weak
depolarizations. The authors suggested that these gating abnormalities
underlie channel dysfunction in FHM.

Tottene et al. (2002) extended single-channel analysis to human
voltage-gated P/Q type calcium channels (Ca(v)2.1) containing the V1457L
mutation. This mutation increased the channel open probability by
shifting its activation to more negative voltages and reduced both the
unitary conductance and the density of functional channels in the
membrane. To investigate the possibility of changes in Ca(v)2.1 function
common to all FHM mutations, Tottene et al. (2002) calculated the
product of single-channel current and open probability as a measure of
calcium ion influx through single Ca(v)2.1 channels. All 5 FHM mutants
analyzed showed a single-channel calcium ion influx larger than
wildtype. They also expressed the FHM mutants in cerebellar granular
cells from mice null for the mutation. The FHM mutations invariably led
to a decrease of the maximal Ca(v)2.1 current density in neurons. The
data showed that mutational changes of functional channel densities can
be different in different cell types, and uncovered 2 functional effects
common to all FHM mutations analyzed: increase of single-channel calcium
ion influx and decrease of maximal Ca(v)2.1 current density in neurons.
Tottene et al. (2002) hypothesized that these 2 apparently contradictory
effects may underlie parallel processes of migraine and aura. This
notion came from the clinical evidence that the migraine aura and the
headache are not necessarily sequential, and that the aura may not be
the trigger for the pain.

By studying mouse hippocampal neurons transfected with 4 human
FHM1-related CACNA1A mutations (R192Q, T666M, V714A, and I1811L), Cao
and Tsien (2005) observed that all 4 mutations resulted in decreased
channel current without a change in voltage dependence. The mutant P/Q
calcium channels were associated with a defect in GABA inhibitory
transmission, although overall basal inhibitory transmission remained
well preserved owing to a shift to N-type calcium channels. This shift
increased the susceptibility to G protein-coupled modulation of
presynaptic neurotransmission, which may be weakened in a heightened
state of neuromodulation, like that provoked by triggers of migraine
such as stress.

In approximately 20% of cases of FHM, the disease is associated with a
mild permanent cerebellar ataxia which may be progressive (PCA). The
CACNA1A gene is involved in about 50% of unselected hemiplegic migraine
families and in all families with FHM/PCA. Ducros et al. (1999) screened
16 families and 3 nonfamilial cases with HPM/PCA for specific CACNA1A
mutations and found 9 families and 1 nonfamilial case with the same
T666M mutation (601011.0002), 1 novel mutation (D715E; 601011.0010) in 1
family, and no CAG repeat expansion. Both T666M and D715E substitutions
were absent in 12 probands belonging to pure HPM families whose disease
appeared to be linked to CACNA1A. Finally, haplotyping with neighboring
markers suggested that T666M arose through recurrent mutational events.
These data suggested that the PCA observed in 20% of HPM families
results from specific pathophysiologic mechanisms.

Ducros et al. (2001) found 9 mutations in the CACNA1A gene in 15 of 16
probands of families affected by hemiplegic migraine and cerebellar
signs, in 2 of 3 subjects with sporadic hemiplegic migraine and
cerebellar signs, and in 4 of 12 probands of families affected by pure
hemiplegic migraine. Genotyping of probands and relatives identified a
total of 117 subjects with mutations whose clinical manifestations were
assessed in detail. Of the subjects with mutations, 89% had attacks of
hemiplegic migraine. One-third had severe attacks with coma, prolonged
hemiplegia, or both, with full recovery. All 9 mutations, including 5
newly identified ones, were missense mutations. Six mutations were
associated with hemiplegic migraine and cerebellar signs, and 83% of the
subjects with these 6 mutations had nystagmus, ataxia, or both. Three
mutations were associated with pure hemiplegic migraine.

Kim et al. (1998) sought mutations in the CACNA1A gene in 9 propositi of
families with migraine headaches and episodic vertigo inherited in an
autosomal dominant pattern. All 47 exons and flanking introns were
subjected to SSCP analysis of PCR-amplified genomic DNA. Several
polymorphisms were found, but no mutations were identified in any of the
47 exons of the 9 patients. They also determined the CAG repeat length
at the 3-prime end of CACNA1A. No index case had a CAG repeat length
greater than 13 (normal less than 17). Thus, mutations in CACNA1A must
be uncommon in families with migraine headaches and episodic vertigo.
Other ion channel genes expressed in the brain and inner ear remained
candidate genes.

Labrum et al. (2009) used multiplex ligation-dependent probe
amplification to screen for large-scale genetic rearrangements in
CACNA1A in 53 patients with a clinical diagnosis of episodic ataxia type
2 or familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 in whom sequencing analysis was
negative for CACNA1A point mutations. They identified a large-scale
deletion in 1 patient with FHM1 (601011.0034) and in several patients
with EA2.

- Spinocerebellar Ataxia 6

Zhuchenko et al. (1997) identified expansion of a CAG repeat
(601011.0007) predicted to code for polyglutamine in the C-terminal
coding region of the CACNL1A4 gene in families with slowly progressive
spinocerebellar ataxia designated SCA6 (183086).

Analysis of CAG repeat expansion in the CACNL1A4 gene by Ishikawa et al.
(1997) revealed expansion in 8 of 15 Japanese families with autosomal
dominant cerebellar ataxia; all affected individuals had larger alleles
(range of CAG repeats 21 to 25), compared with alleles observed in
neurologically normal Japanese (range 5 to 20 repeats). Inverse
correlation between the CAG-repeat number and the age of onset was found
in affected individuals with expansion. The number of CAG repeats in
expanded chromosomes was completely stable within each family, which was
consistent with the fact that anticipation was not statistically proved
in these SCA6 families. Ishikawa et al. (1997) concluded that more than
half of Japanese cases of ADPCA map to 19p and are strongly associated
with the mild CAG expansion in the SCA6/CACNL1A4 gene.

Using a whole-cell voltage clamp technique, Toru et al. (2000)
demonstrated functional alterations of human alpha-1A channels carrying
various polyglutamine lengths in a model of SCA6. Alpha-1A channels
lacking an asparagine-proline (NP) stretch in domain IV corresponded to
P-type channels expressed in Purkinje cells, the main cell that is
degenerated in SCA6. Polyglutamine elongation caused a proportional
negative shift of voltage-dependent inactivation, and the authors
hypothesized that the resulting reduction of calcium influx may
contribute to Purkinje cell death.

Kordasiewicz et al. (2006) found that the 75-kD C-terminal fragment of
CACNA1A, which is the location of the polyglutamine tract expanded in
SCA6, is cleaved from the full-length protein and translocated to the
nucleus, where it is toxic to cells when in the expanded state. The
polyglutamine-mediated cell toxicity was dependent on nuclear
localization, suggesting that specific processing and localization of
the mutant protein is involved in the pathogenesis of SCA6.

Li et al. (2009) confirmed that C-terminal fragments of CACNA1A
localized predominantly to the nucleus of HEK293 cells where they
existed as speckle-like structures resembling promyelocytic leukemia
nuclear bodies (PMLNBs). HEK293 cells expressing an expanded (24 CAG
repeats) C-terminal end of CACNA1A showed decreased viability when
exposed to toxic cadmium compared to cells with nonexpanded (13 CAG)
repeats. However, there were no differences in viability under normal
culture conditions. Cadmium treatment also disrupted PMLNBs and enhanced
aggregation of C-terminal CACNA1A fragments, particularly in
CAG-expanded cells. Immunocytochemical studies showed that
cadmium-induced death was caspase-3 (CASP3; 600636)-dependent,
indicating apoptosis. Gene expression studies showed downregulation of
the HSF1 (140580)-HSPA1A (140550) axis as an event in 24-CAG repeat
cells that appeared to be critical for cellular toxicity. The findings
were consistent with SCA6 pathogenesis being related to polyglutamine
diseases.

- Idiopathic Generalized Epilepsy

Chioza et al. (2001) provided direct evidence that the CACNA1A gene is
involved in the etiology of idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE;
600669). They analyzed 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from
patients with IGE and found that 1 of them, SNP8, showed significant
association with the disease. Because SNP8 is a silent polymorphism, the
authors suggested that the association must be with a closely linked
variant.

PATHOGENESIS

Ackerman and Clapham (1997) provided a comprehensive review of the role
of ion channel defects in disease. They provided useful illustrations of
the physiology and structure of ion channels and of patch-clamp
measurement of ion channel activity. They also discussed the design and
use of drugs that target ion channels.

- Drug Design

Hoffman and Gardner (1997) pointed out that a drug designed to correct
for the calcium-channel defect in patients with mutations of the
CACNL1A4 gene may need to be completely 'phenotype-specific' as well as
'channel-specific' and may need to modulate the activity of the calcium
channel differently between several disorders, despite the shared site
of the biochemical defect. Conceivably, inhibitors of channel function
may be effective in disorders caused by change-of-function mutations
(e.g., in patients with hemiplegic migraine), whereas agents that
stimulate the same channel might be beneficial in patients with
loss-of-function mutations (such as those in episodic ataxia). Drugs
that modulate the level of function of the channels may have little
efficacy in patients with the SCA6 phenotype, since this disorder
results from progressive cerebellar cell loss which is probably due to
neurotoxicity of the polyglutamine peptide that is mutated in the
disorder.

ANIMAL MODEL

By a positional cloning approach, Fletcher et al. (1996) identified an
alpha-1 voltage-sensitive Ca(2+) channel gene that is mutated in the
'tottering' mutations in tg and tg(la) mice. The tg mutation is a
well-studied mutation that gives rise to behavioral arrest seizures,
which may be compared to human absence (or petit mal) epilepsy (600131)
and cerebellar ataxia. The tottering phenotype also includes motor
seizures. Fletcher et al. (1996) noted that the tg leaner mice, tg(la),
suffer from absence seizures but do not have motor seizures. These mice
are severely ataxic. Fletcher et al. (1996) mapped the tg phenotype to
mouse chromosome 8 in the vicinity of the Junb gene (165161). Fletcher
et al. (1996) evaluated the Ca(2+) channel gene as a candidate for the
tg locus using RT-PCR and sequencing. In the tg(la) mice they
demonstrated a single G-to-A change in a splice donor site in the
portion of the mouse gene encoding the putative regulatory C-terminal
domain of the channel. This mutation resulted in several aberrant mRNA
species, including insertion of 98 nucleotides at position 5901/2 and
deletion of nucleotides 5763-5901, either of which altered the reading
frame 3-prime to the mutations. The tg transcript contained a C-to-A
change at position 1802 relative to the control sequence. Fletcher et
al. (1996) reported that this alteration leads to a nonconservative
proline-to-leucine amino acid substitution that may affect the pore
function of the Ca(2+) channel. Fletcher et al. (1996) noted that this
is the first gene identified as being involved in absence epilepsy.

The alpha-1 voltage-sensitive Ca(2+) channel sequence reported by
Fletcher et al. (1996) is the mouse homolog of the human Ca(2+) channel
alpha subunit, also designated CACNL1A4. It is noteworthy that the
CACNL1A4 gene maps to chromosome 19p13 in a region that is homologous to
the region of mouse chromosome 8 where tg maps.

In a provocatively entitled minireview, 'Migraines in Mice?,' Hess
(1996) compared the tottering/leaner mouse mutations with the human
mutations in CACNL1A4. She referred to inherited ion channel mutations
as channelopathies.

Thibault and Landfield (1996) used partially dissociated hippocampal
slice preparations to analyze single Ca(2+) channel activity in neurons
of adult and aged rats. They reported that total L-type Ca(2+) channel
activity increased primarily because of increased density of functional
channels. They noted that learning in aged animals was inversely
correlated with channel density. Thibault and Landfield (1996)
postulated that the observed increase in functional Ca(2+) channels with
aging could underlie the vulnerability of neurons to age-associated
neurodegenerative conditions.

Van den Maagdenberg et al. (2004) generated a transgenic mouse model
carrying the human CACNA1A mutation R192Q (601011.0001). Cultured
cerebellar granule cells from R192Q mice showed increased Ca(v)2.1
channel current densities, which were activated at more negative
voltages than wildtype channels. Neuromuscular synapses with the mutant
CACNA1A channels had increased induced neurotransmission and increased
spontaneous miniature endplate potential frequency at low Ca(2+) levels
compared to controls, consistent with a gain of function. In addition,
the intact transgenic animal showed increased susceptibility to cortical
spreading depression, the likely mechanism for migraine aura. Van den
Maagdenberg et al. (2004) concluded that the underlying mechanism in FHM
is cortical hyperexcitability due to excessive release of excitatory
amino acids in response to increased Ca(2+) influx through a defective
Ca(v)2.1 channel.

Near postnatal day 10, mice lacking P/Q-type calcium channels have
difficulty walking, have absence seizures, and are ataxic and dystonic.
Neurologic symptoms in these mice become more acute with age, until they
are unable to walk and die at about 3 weeks of age (Jun et al., 1999).
Mutant animals also show increased density of T-type channels (CACNA1G;
604065) that support low-threshold action potentials in the absence of
P/Q-type channels (Song et al., 2004). Llinas et al. (2007) found that
in vitro patch recordings of thalamic neurons from mice lacking P/Q-type
channels showed no gamma band subthreshold oscillation, and
voltage-sensitive dye imaging demonstrated absence of cortical gamma
band-dependent columnar activation involving cortical inhibitory
interneuron activity. In vivo EEGs showed showed persistent absence
status and dramatically reduced gamma band activity. Pharmacologic
blockade of T-type channels left knockout mice in a coma-like state,
indicating that increased T-type channel expression in thalamocortical
neurons was causally related to generation of absence seizures. Llinas
et al. (2007) concluded that P/Q-type calcium channels are essential for
generation of gamma band activity and resultant cognitive function.

Watase et al. (2008) found that knockin mice expressing a hyperexpanded
polyglutamine (84Q) Cacna1a repeat developed progressive motor
impairment consistent with SCA6. Knockin mice with normal 14 CAG or
expanded 30 CAG repeats did not show such defects. Electrophysiologic
analysis of cerebellar Purkinje cells revealed similar calcium channel
current density among the 3 mouse models, although all were decreased
compared to wildtype due to decreased channel abundance. Neither voltage
sensitivity of activation nor inactivation was altered in the Sca6(84Q)
neurons, suggesting that the expanded CAG repeat does not per se affect
the intrinsic electrophysiologic properties of the channels. Mice with
the hyperexpanded polyglutamine repeat showed cytoplasmic neuronal
inclusions, consistent with aggregation of mutant calcium channels.
Watase et al. (2008) concluded that the pathogenesis of SCA6 is related
to an age-dependent process accompanied by accumulation of mutant
CACNA1A channels resulting in a toxic gain-of-function effect.

Van Oosterhout et al. (2008) found that R192Q-mutant mice showed
atypical phase resetting of their circadian rhythms when subjected to
6-hour advance shifts of the light/dark cycle. Compared to controls,
mutant mice showed a more than 2-fold enhanced adjustment of behavioral
wheel-running activity and EEG patterns, as well as enhanced shifts of
electrical activity of suprachiasmatic neurons (SCN) in vivo. No
differences were observed for a 6-hour delay. The physiologic inhibitory
process appeared to be mediated by CACNA1A channel-dependent afferent
signaling from extra-SCN brain areas to the SCN. Van Oosterhout et al.
(2008) interpreted the findings as suggesting that abrupt circadian
rhythm changes may trigger migraine attacks, possibly because patients
have an inadequate adaptation mechanism.

Eikermann-Haerter et al. (2009) found that transgenic mice expressing
the R192Q or S218L (601011.0017) CACNA1A mutations had increased
frequency and speed of spreading depression and enhanced corticostriatal
propagation compared to wildtype mice after induction. Mutant mice also
developed severe and prolonged neurologic deficits. The susceptibility
to spreading depression and neurologic deficits was affected by allele
dosage and was higher in S218L than R192Q mutants, similar to
observations in humans. Female mutant mice were more susceptible to
spreading depression and neurologic deficits than males, and this sex
difference was abrogated by ovariectomy or senescence and partially
restored by estrogen replacement. The findings implicating ovarian
hormones in the observed sex differences in humans with FHM1. In a
follow-up study, Eikermann-Haerter et al. (2009) demonstrated that
orchidectomy in R192Q-mutant male mice increased susceptibility to
cortical spreading depression, and that chronic testosterone replacement
restored the lower susceptibility in mutant males. These findings
implicated androgens as a modulating factor in genetically-enhanced
susceptibility to cortical spreading depression.

Van den Maagdenberg et al. (2010) found that transgenic S218L homozygous
mice had mild cerebellar ataxia and reduced arborization of proximal
primary dendrites of cerebellar Purkinje neurons. They exhibited 2 types
of spontaneous attacks: those consistent with hemiparesis observed in
patients with FHM1 and attacks of generalized seizures that were fatal
in some cases. In addition, homozygous mutant mice developed significant
brain edema 24 hours after mild head impact, indicating that these mice
mimicked the broad complex neurologic spectrum of spontaneous episodic,
mild impact-triggered, and permanent clinical features seen in human
patients heterozygous for the S218L mutation. In vitro studies on mouse
cerebellar granule neurons showed that the S218L mutation increased
whole-cell calcium current density at negative voltages, resulted in a
leftward shift in voltage-dependent activation, and increased
spontaneous neurotransmitter release, consistent with a gain of
function. The calcium current in homozygous mutant cells was 6.6 times
greater than that in wildtype neurons. Further studies showed that
mutant mice had an increased susceptibility to successive cortical
spreading depression events compared to wildtype and mutant R192Q mice.
In general, all of the changes associated with the S218L mutation were
quantitatively more pronounced than those observed with the R192Q
mutation.

In 5 unrelated families with familial hemiplegic migraine (141500),
Ophoff et al. (1996) identified 4 different missense mutations in the
CACNL1A4 gene. One of these mutations was a G-to-A transition at
nucleotide 850 in exon 4 resulting in an arg192-to-gln (R192Q) amino
acid substitution.

CACNA1A, THR666MET

In families with hemiplegic migraine (141500), Ophoff et al. (1996)
discovered a C-to-T transition in nucleotide 2272 of CACNL1A4, resulting
in a thr666-to-met (T666M) amino acid substitution.

Ducros et al. (1999) screened 16 families and 3 nonfamilial cases with
hemiplegic migraine associated with progressive cerebellar ataxia. They
found the T666M mutation in 9 families and 1 nonfamilial case. The T666M
mutation was absent in 12 probands belonging to pure HPM families whose
disease appeared to be linked to CACNA1A.

Friend et al. (1999) found this recurrent mutation in exon 16 in an
Australian patient with familial hemiplegic migraine.

Terwindt et al. (2002) studied 27 patients with sporadic hemiplegic
migraine and found the T666M mutation in a 78-year-old woman who had
characteristic attacks starting at age 14 as well as interictal
nystagmus, dysarthria, limb and gait ataxia, and cerebellar atrophy.

Kors et al. (2003) reported the clinical symptoms of 5 families with
hemiplegic migraine and the T666M mutation. Three of the families
displayed cerebellar ataxia, 3 had loss of consciousness or coma
associated with episodes, 1 had attacks with confusion but without
hemiparesis, and 1 had progressive cognitive dysfunction. The authors
emphasized the inter- and intrafamilial clinical heterogeneity.

In families with hemiplegic migraine (141500), Ophoff et al. (1996)

resulting in a val714-to-ala (V714A) amino acid substitution.

MIGRAINE, FAMILIAL HEMIPLEGIC, 1
CACNA1A, ILE1811LEU

In 2 unrelated families, Ophoff et al. (1996) found that members with
hemiplegic migraine (141500) had an A-to-C transversion at nucleotide
5706 of the CACNL1A4 gene, resulting in an ile1811-to-leu (I1811L) amino
acid substitution in the gene product. The mutation occurred on
different 19p13 haplotypes in the 2 families, indicating that this was a
recurrent mutation rather than a founder effect. Cerebellar atrophy is
said to occur in approximately 40% of chromosome 19-linked HPM families
but not in unlinked HPM families (Terwindt et al., 1996). Of the 2
families with the I1811L mutation, Ophoff et al. (1996) noted that only
1 displayed cerebellar atrophy and in that family only some members were
affected. Apparently other factors in this amino acid substitution
further contribute to the phenotypic variability. These factors may
include genetic polymorphisms elsewhere in the gene or at other
channel-related loci and the net effect of other ion channels on the
polarity of the cell membrane.

CACNA1A, 1-BP DEL, 4073C

In 2 unrelated patients with episodic ataxia type 2 (108500), Ophoff et
al. (1996) identified mutations resulting in a disrupted reading frame.
The first of these was deletion of a single C, nucleotide 4073 in codon
1266, leading to a frameshift in the putative translation product with a
stop codon in the next exon (codon 1294). See also 601011.0006.

EPISODIC ATAXIA, TYPE 2
CACNA1A, IVS24DS, G-A, +1

In a patient with episodic ataxia type 2 (108500), Ophoff et al. (1996)
identified a G-to-A transition in the first nucleotide of intron 24,
changing the highly conserved GT dinucleotide of the intronic 5-prime
splice junction. The mutation resulted in the loss of a BsaAI
restriction site. The brain-specific expression of CACNL1A4 precluded
testing the hypothesis that this mutation produced aberrantly spliced
RNAs by retaining the intron or utilizing other cryptic 5-prime splice
sites. Such was, however, presumably the case.

.0007
SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA 6
CACNA1A, (CAG)n EXPANSION

Zhuchenko et al. (1997) identified expansion of a CAG repeat predicted
to encode for polyglutamine in exon 47 of the coding region of the
CACNL1A4 gene in families with slowly progressive spinocerebellar ataxia
designated SCA6 (183086).

Matsuyama et al. (1997) analyzed 60 SCA6 individuals from 39 independent
Japanese SCA6 families and found that the CAG repeat length in the
CACNL1A4 gene was inversely correlated with age of onset. SCA6
chromosomes contained 21 to 30 repeat units, whereas normal chromosomes
displayed 6 to 17 repeats. There was no overlap between the normal and
affected CAG repeat number. Anticipation was observed clinically in all
8 parent-child pairs examined; the mean age of onset was significantly
lower (P = 0.0042) in children than in parents. However, a parent-child
analysis showed an increase in the expansion of CAG repeats only in 1
pair and no diminution in any affected cases. The results suggested that
factors other than CAG repeats may produce the clinical anticipation. A
homozygotic case could not demonstrate unequivocal gene dosage effect on
the age of onset. See also Ishikawa et al. (1997).

Riess et al. (1997) found that the SCA6 mutation accounts for
approximately 10% of autosomal dominant SCA in Germany. They observed
the trinucleotide expansion in 4 ataxia patients without obvious family
history of the disease, indicating the necessity to search for the SCA6
(CAG)n expansion even in sporadic patients. In their series of 32
patients, onset was usually late and the (CAG)n stretch varied between
22 and 28 trinucleotide units, the shortest trinucleotide repeat
expansion causing spinocerebellar ataxia. Analyzing 248 apparently
healthy octogenarians, Riess et al. (1997) found 1 allele of 18 repeats,
the longest normal CAG repeat in the CACNL1A4 gene reported to that
time. They could demonstrate no repeat instability of the expanded
allele on transmission and no repeat instability was found for the
normal allele in 431 meioses in the CEPH families.

Sasaki et al. (1998) described neuropathologic and molecular findings in
a Japanese woman who died of lymphoma at the age of 61 years after a
7-year history of progressive pure cerebellar ataxia. Neuropathologic
examination showed neuronal degeneration confined to the cerebellar
Purkinje cells and, to a lesser degree, the granular cells, without
involvement of other CNS structures. The pathologic selectivity
correlated with the localized expression of the CACNA1A gene and
coincided with the neurologic manifestations. The father and a sister
were also affected. Each of the affected sisters was heterozygous for an
expanded allele with a repeat size that fell into the range of the SCA6
mutation.

Craig et al. (2008) identified a common core haplotype carrying the
CACNA1A CAG repeat in 45 SCA6 families from different geographic
regions, including Europe, Brazil, and Japan. The haplotype was also
present in the unaffected father of a proven de novo Japanese patient,
suggesting that the shared chromosome predisposes to the CAG repeat
expansion at the SCA6 locus. The SCA6 expansion lies immediately
downstream of a CpG island, which could act as a cis-acting element
predisposing to repeat expansion, as observed for other CAG/CTG repeat
diseases.

EPISODIC ATAXIA, TYPE 2
CACNA1A, (CAG)n EXPANSION

In a family with a clinical diagnosis of episodic ataxia-2 (108500),
Jodice et al. (1997) found a (CAG)23 repeat allele segregating in
patients showing different interictal symptoms, ranging from nystagmus
only to severe progressive cerebellar ataxia. No additional mutations in
coding and intron-exon junction sequences in disequilibrium with the CAG
expansion were found. In a second family, initially classified as
autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia of unknown type, an
intergenerational allele size change showed that a (CAG)20 allele was
associated with an EA2 phenotype and a (CAG)25 allele with progressive
cerebellar ataxia. These results suggested that EA2 and SCA6 (183086)
are the same disorder with a high phenotypic variability, at least
partly related to the number of repeats, and suggested that the small
expansions may not be as stable as previously reported. See also
601011.0007.

SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA 6
EPISODIC ATAXIA, TYPE 2, INCLUDED
CACNA1A, GLY293ARG

Yue et al. (1997) studied a family in which multiple members had severe
progressive cerebellar ataxia involving the trunk, extremities, and
speech (183086). The proband started at age 15 years with gradual onset
of imbalance and incoordination. Slurred speech was first noted in her
twenties. She became confined to a wheelchair at the age of 44 years. By
that time prominent atrophy of the cerebellum was demonstrated by
magnetic resonance imaging. Two sons had episodes of vertigo and ataxia
that were not responsive to acetazolamide, consistent with episodic
ataxia type 2 (108500). Quantitative eye movement testing showed a
consistent pattern of abnormalities localized to the cerebellum.
Genotyping suggested linkage to 19p, and SSCP showed an aberrant
migrating fragment in exon 6 of the CACNA1A gene which cosegregated with
the disease. Sequencing of exon 6 identified a G-to-A transition in 1
allele, at nucleotide 1152, resulting in a predicted gly293-to-arg amino
acid substitution. The CAG-repeat expansion associated with SCA6
(601011.0007) was not present in any family member. Yue et al. (1997)
indicated that replacement of a neutral amino acid (glycine) with a
positively charged amino acid (arginine) near the center of the pore in
domain I would likely lead to a distortion of the pore region. Two
patients in the family had prominent ataxic episodes, whereas the other
2 patients had no episodes, suggesting that other factors such as
modifying genes or metabolic factors such as hormone levels may be
important in determining susceptibility to episodic dysfunction. On the
other hand, all 4 patients exhibited gradually progressive ataxia,
indicating that this pore mutation resulted in chronic increased
intracellular calcium, ultimately leading to neuronal death.

Wan et al. (2005) performed functional expression studies of the G293R
mutation in the family reported by Yue et al. (1997) and the adjacent
C287Y mutation (601011.0025).

CACNA1A, ASP715GLU

In a family in which members were affected with hemiplegic migraine
(141500) associated with progressive cerebellar ataxia, Ducros et al.
(1999) identified an asp715-to-glu (D715E) mutation in the CACNA1A gene.

.0011
EPISODIC ATAXIA, TYPE 2
CACNA1A, ARG1666HIS

Friend et al. (1999) found a 5260G-A transition in exon 32 of the
CACNA1A gene, resulting in an arg1666-to-his amino acid substitution, in
a patient with episodic ataxia (108500). The amino acid substitution
occurred in a highly conserved position within the gene. This
represented the first point mutation that did not result in a proposed
truncated protein. One member of the family, who had inherited both the
mutation and the affected haplotype, had no clinical evidence of
cerebellar dysfunction. On examination, he had no signs of nystagmus on
lateral gaze, and his balance and cerebellar examination were within
normal limits. He did, however, experience migraines.

.0012
EPISODIC ATAXIA, TYPE 2
CACNA1A, PHE1491SER

Guida et al. (2001) reported the first functional analysis of a novel
missense mutation associated with an EA2 phenotype: a T-to-C transition
at nucleotide 4747 in exon 28 of the CACNA1A gene, predicted to change a
highly conserved phenylalanine residue to a serine at codon 1491,
located in the putative transmembrane segment S6 of domain III.
Patch-clamp recording in HEK 293 cells, coexpressing the mutagenized
human alpha-1A subunit, together with the human beta and alpha-delta
subunits, showed that channel activity was completely abolished,
although the mutated protein was expressed in the cell. These results
indicated that a complete loss of P/Q channel function is the mechanism
underlying EA2, whether due to truncating or to missense mutations.

.0013
MIGRAINE, FAMILIAL HEMIPLEGIC, 1
CACNA1A, TYR1385CYS

In a patient with hemiplegic migraine associated with coma,
hyperthermia, meningeal signs, and partial seizures, Vahedi et al.
(2000) identified a de novo A-to-G transversion (TAC to TGC) at codon
1385 of the CACNA1A gene, resulting in a tyrosine-to-cysteine amino acid
substitution in the alpha-1A subunit of the P/Q-type calcium channel.
The mutation was not detected in 200 control chromosomes or in either of
the healthy parents, suggesting that the mutation is not a polymorphism.
The mutation is in the highly conserved segment 5 of the third domain of
the calcium channel, an area previously shown to be important in
familial hemiplegic migraine (Ophoff et al., 1996; Ducros et al., 1999).

.0014
EPISODIC ATAXIA, TYPE 2
CACNA1A, GLU1757LYS

In 4 members of a family with onset of episodic ataxia type 2 (108500)
after age 30, Denier et al. (2001) identified a G-to-A change in exon 35
of the CACNA1A gene, resulting in a glu1757-to-lys substitution. The
authors did not detect the mutation in 200 control chromosomes. The
mutation affects a highly conserved amino acid located in the pore loop,
which plays a major role in the function of the channel.

.0015
EPISODIC ATAXIA, TYPE 2
CACNA1A, 1-BP INS, 3091G

Scoggan et al. (2001) identified a 1-bp insertion at nucleotide 3091 of
the CACNA1A gene (3091insG) in an individual with episodic ataxia type 2
(108500). Scoggan et al. (2001) believed this to be the first mutation
identified to occur in an intracellular loop of the CACNA1A protein.

Scoggan et al. (2001) identified a 1-bp deletion at nucleotide 5123 of
the CACNA1A gene (5123delG) in an individual with episodic ataxia type 2
(108500). Scoggan et al. (2001) believed this to be the most 3-prime
CACNA1A mutation reported to that time.

.0017
MIGRAINE, FAMILIAL HEMIPLEGIC 1, WITH PROGRESSIVE CEREBELLAR ATAXIA
CACNA1A, SER218LEU

Noting that familial hemiplegic migraine (141500) can be triggered by
minor head trauma, Kors et al. (2001) investigated a role for CACNA1A in
'delayed cerebral edema,' a severe, sometimes even fatal, cerebral edema
and coma occurring after a lucid interval as a result of trivial head
trauma. In 2 patients with the phenomenon from a family with extreme
familial hemiplegic migraine and in 1 patient whose parent had familial
hemiplegic migraine and whose family suffered from various neurologic
abnormalities, Kors et al. (2001) identified heterozygosity for a
mutation in the CACNA1A gene, resulting in the replacement of a
hydrophilic serine for a hydrophobic leucine at residue 218 (S218L) in
the highly conserved intracellular loop of the alpha-1A subunit. The
authors suggested a pathogenic mechanism involving ionic perturbation
resulting from inappropriately depolarized ion channels.

Chan et al. (2008) reported 3 Malaysian sibs with FHM1 due to
heterozygosity for a 935C-T transition in exon 5 of the CACNA1A gene,
resulting in the S218L mutation. The phenotype of the hemiplegic
migraine episodes was severe in the older brother and sister, each of
whom became comatose on at least 1 occasion. A history of generalized
seizures was associated with mild head trauma in the older boy and with
febrile illness in the younger boy. The older brother and sister also
had cerebellar atrophy on brain MRI. EEG studies of them during
hemiplegic attacks showed evidence of depressed cortical activity
contralateral to the hemiparesis, perhaps representing cortical
spreading depression due to a defect in calcium channel activity.

CACNA1A, ARG583GLN

In 2 Italian sisters with familial hemiplegic migraine (141500) and
late-onset cerebellar ataxia and cerebellar atrophy, Battistini et al.
(1999) identified an arg583-to-gln (R583Q) mutation in a putative
voltage sensor domain of the CACNA1A gene. The frequency and severity of
the attacks increased near the sixth decade for both patients, when the
cerebellar signs developed. Acetazolamide was effective prophylactic
therapy.

Terwindt et al. (2002) studied 27 patients with sporadic hemiplegic
migraine and found the R583Q mutation in a 16-year-old boy with no
cerebellar signs.

In a large Portuguese family in which 17 patients over 4 generations
were affected with hemiplegic migraine and/or progressive cerebellar
ataxia-6 (SCA6; 183086), Alonso et al. (2003) found that all patients
shared a common haplotype and carried the R583Q mutation. Mean age at
onset for hemiplegic migraine symptoms was in the second decade and
onset of cerebellar signs was approximately 20 years later. Four
patients, all under the age of 18 years, had only hemiplegic migraine, 8
patients had isolated progressive cerebellar ataxia, and 5 patients had
both hemiplegic migraine and cerebellar ataxia. Several patients
reported symptoms triggered by minor head trauma. Alonso et al. (2003)
postulated that the mutation, which occurs in a transmembrane segment of
the voltage sensor of the channel, may cause a shift in the voltage
dependence of the channel, leading to an increase in intracellular
calcium. They suggested that episodic ataxia-2 (108500), SCA6, and
familial hemiplegic migraine are not only allelic disorders, but may be
the same disorder with great phenotypic variability.

De Vries et al. (2007) identified a 2021G-A transition in the CACNA1A
gene, resulting in an R583Q substitution, in a patient who developed FHM
at age 13 years. The mutation was also identified in his mother, who had
migraine with aura. The findings suggested either reduced penetrance or
a common pathogenetic mechanism for both hemiplegic and nonhemiplegic
migraine.

CACNA1A, VAL1457LEU

In a 5-generation Caucasian family originating from northeastern Italy,
in which the average age of onset of familial hemiplegic migraine
(141500) was 33.8 years, Carrera et al. (1999) found a G-to-T
transversion at nucleotide position 4644 in exon 27 of the CACNA1A gene,
which resulted in a val1457-to-leu (V1457L) amino acid substitution. All
patients had clinical symptoms preceded by aura, followed by hemiparesis
and various degrees of aphasia congruent with the hemispheric dominance
of each individual. Patients did not report cerebellar ataxia or coma.
Carrera et al. (1999) noted that the location of the mutation, in the
putative pore-forming (P) region between the S5-S6 transmembrane domains
in motif III of CACNA1A, suggests a potential for interference in
transmembrane conductance.

.0020
EPISODIC ATAXIA, TYPE 2
CACNA1A, ARG1281TER

Yue et al. (1998) reported a patient with episodic ataxia type 2
(108500) who carried a 4410C-T substitution in exon 23 of the CACNA1A
gene, resulting in an arg1281-to-ter (R1281X) mutation that predicts a
truncated product containing only the first 2 domains of the protein.
The patient experienced attacks of vertigo, truncal and limb ataxia,
nystagmus, and diffuse weakness during ataxic spells.

By use of whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, Jen et al. (2001)
demonstrated that the R1281X, R1549X (601011.0021), and F1406C
(601011.0022) mutations, when expressed in COS-7 cells, resulted in
markedly diminished barium current density and amplitude compared with
the wildtype gene. They used single-fiber EMG (SFEMG) recordings to
examine synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction in the 3
patients who carried these mutations, all of whom complained of episodic
weakness. The SFEMG demonstrated abnormal neuromuscular transmission in
vivo, suggesting that these mutations contributed to the symptoms of
weakness described by the patients.

EPISODIC ATAXIA, TYPE 2
CACNA1A, ARG1549TER

Jen et al. (1999) reported affected members of a family with episodic
ataxia type 2 (108500) who carried a 4914C-T substitution in exon 29 of
the CACNA1A gene. The substitution resulted in an arg1549-to-ter
(R1549X) mutation (reported in the article as ARG1547TER) that predicts
a truncated product containing the first 3 domains of the protein. The
patients experienced attacks of vertigo, truncal and limb ataxia,
nystagmus, and diffuse weakness during ataxic spells. See also

CACNA1A, PHE1406CYS

Jen et al. (2001) reported a patient with episodic ataxia type 2
(108500) who also developed progressive episodic weakness beginning in
his teens. Mutation analysis revealed a 4486T-G change in exon 26 of the
CACNA1A gene, resulting in a phe1406-to-cys (F1406) change in the
putative P loop of the protein between domains 3 and 4, which may
disrupt pore formation. See also 601011.0020.

EPISODIC ATAXIA, TYPE 2, AND EPILEPSY
CACNA1A, ARG1820TER

In an isolated case of a boy with seizures, episodic ataxia type 2
(108500), and interictal progressive cerebellar signs, Jouvenceau et al.
(2001) identified a heterozygous 5733C-T transition in the CACNA1A gene,
resulting in a premature stop codon (arg1820 to ter; R1820X) between the
last transmembrane segment (IVS6) and the intracellular C terminus of
the mature protein. Functional expression studies indicated a
dominant-negative effect on channel conductance. Jouvenceau et al.
(2001) noted that mouse models of absence epilepsy and cerebellar
degeneration harbor mutations in the CACNA1A gene.

Holtmann et al. (2002) reported a family in which a father and daughter
had idiopathic focal epilepsy, episodic ataxia type 2, and migraine.
Four other family members had migraine, and 2 had reported seizures.
Holtmann et al. (2002) suggested that the cooccurrence of periodic
neurologic disorders in their family was similar to that in the case
presented by Jouvenceau et al. (2001).

In a mother and her 2 adult children who had familial hemiplegic

Kors et al. (2004) identified a heterozygous 5405T-C transition in exon
33 of the CACNA1A gene, resulting in an ile1710-to-thr (I1710T)
substitution within transmembrane segment 5 of the fourth domain of the
protein. Kors et al. (2004) stated that the affected residue is strongly
conserved. In addition to FHM and SCA6, both children had complex
partial and generalized tonic-clonic seizures that occurred
independently of the FHM attacks and were restricted to childhood.

EPISODIC ATAXIA, TYPE 2
CACNA1A, CYS287TYR

In affected members of a family with episodic ataxia type 2 (108500) and
mild baseline ataxia, Wan et al. (2005) identified a 1096G-A transition
in exon 6 of the CACNA1A gene, resulting in a cys287-to-tyr (C287Y)
substitution in the putative P loop between transmembrane segments S5
and S6 within domain I of the protein. The mutation is adjacent to
another mutation, G293R (601011.0009), in the same region of the
protein. Functional expression studies of both mutations indicated that
the mutant channels exhibited decreased current densities (31 to 35% of
wildtype), which were partially restored by cooling. Immunofluorescence
studies showed that the mutant proteins accumulated in the endoplasmic
reticulum. The findings suggested that the mutations caused misfolding
and altered trafficking of the protein, resulting in a defect in plasma
membrane targeting. Once expressed at the cell surface, the mutant
channels were able to conduct current but with altered biophysical
properties. Wan et al. (2005) hypothesized that the episodic features of
EA2 result from altered channel function, while the interictal features
result from protein mishandling, eventually leading to cerebellar
neuronal death.

In 3 affected members of a family with episodic ataxia type 2 (108500),
Riant et al. (2008) identified a heterozygous 39.5-kb deletion in the
CACNA1A gene, resulting in the removal of the last 16 coding exons of

the deletion arose through homologous recombination of Alu sequences.

In affected members of 4 unrelated families with FHM1 (141500), Stam et

the CACNA1A gene, resulting in an arg1347-to-gln (R1347Q) substitution
in the S4 segment of protein domain III. Haplotype analysis excluded a
founder effect. In 3 of the 4 families, age at onset was before age 3
years. Two patients in 1 family also had focal seizures. Stam et al.
(2008) stated that the R1347Q mutation was the third most common CACNA1A

602777	TITLE *602777 SMALL NUCLEAR RNA-ACTIVATING PROTEIN COMPLEX, POLYPEPTIDE 4; SNAPC4
;;SMALL NUCLEAR RNA-ACTIVATING PROTEIN COMPLEX, 190-KD SUBUNIT; SNAP190;;
PSE-BINDING TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR, ALPHA;;
PTF-ALPHA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SNAPC4 encodes a subunit of the snRNA-activating protein complex
(SNAPc), which is required for transcription of both RNA polymerase II
and III snRNA genes (see SNAPC1, 600591).

CLONING

Wong et al. (1998) reported that SNAPc consists of at least 4 subunits,
3 of which, SNAPC1, SNAPC2 (605076), and SNAPC3 (602348), had been
cloned. Using sequences derived from purified SNAPc, Wong et al. (1998)
assembled a cDNA open reading frame for SNAPC4 (SNAP190), the largest
known subunit of the SNAP complex (190 kD), by a combination of library
screens and direct RT-PCR. The 1,469-amino acid protein encoded by this
sequence contains a Myb protein domain followed by arginine- and
serine-rich regions, and a carboxy-terminal region with a leucine
zipper-like motif.

GENE FUNCTION

Wong et al. (1998) showed that SNAPC4 is required for both RNA
polymerase II and III transcription of snRNA genes and that it interacts
strongly with SNAPC2 but not with SNAPC1 or SNAPC3. In addition, they
found that whereas full-length SNAPC4 protein did not bind to the PSE, a
truncated protein containing the Rc and Rd repeats within the Myb domain
was able to bind DNA specifically. The carboxy-terminal half of SNAPC4
can interact with DNA-bound transcription activator OCT1 (164175).

612931	TITLE *612931 PHOSPHOGLYCERATE MUTASE 2; PGAM2
;;PHOSPHOGLYCERATE MUTASE, MUSCLE; PGAMM
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The PGAM2 gene encodes muscle phosphoglycerate mutase-2 (EC 5.4.2.1).
PGAM is a dimer containing, in different tissues, various proportions of
a slow-migrating muscle (M) isoenzyme and a fast-migrating brain (B)
isoenzyme (PGAMB, PGAM1; 172250) (DiMauro et al., 1986).

CLONING

Shanske et al. (1987) isolated a full-length cDNA specifying the
muscle-specific subunit of PGAM. The deduced 253-residue protein was
clearly related to yeast Pgam and to bisphosphoglycerate mutase (BPGM;
613896). Genomic Southern analysis with this cDNA suggested the presence
of a large PGAM gene family in the human genome, while Northern analysis
demonstrated tissue-specific transcription of the specific PGAM gene.
The B subunit is predominantly expressed in red blood cells, liver, and
brain, the M subunit in muscle, and both subunits in heart.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tsujino et al. (1989) found that the PGAM2 gene spans 2.83 kb and has a
3-exon/2-intron structure similar to that of the BPGM gene, in that the
second intron in both genes is localized at precisely the same position.
Comparison with other muscle-specific enzyme genes showed a conserved
9-bp element (GGGGCTGGG) in the 5-prime flanking region that may be
associated with the expression of genes encoding muscle-specific
enzymes.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, Mattei et al. (1989) mapped the PGAMM gene to
chromosome 7p13-p12; see Castella-Escola et al. (1990). The B subunit of
PGAM maps to 10q25, and the BPGM maps to 7q22-q34.

Edwards et al. (1989) used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to
amplify the human PGAM2 sequence in rodent/human hybrid DNA and thereby
map the gene to human chromosome 7.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 5 patients with muscle phosphoglycerate mutase deficiency, also known
as glycogen storage disease X (GSD10; 261670), Tsujino et al. (1993)
identified 3 homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the PGAM2
gene (612931.0001-612931.0003). Four of the 5 patients were African
American; the fifth was Italian. All had severely decreased PGAM2
activity (2 to 6% of normal values).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE X
PGAM2, TRP78TER

In 3 unrelated African American patients with glycogen storage disease X
(GSD10; 261670), Tsujino et al. (1993) identified a homozygous G-to-A
transition in the PGAM2 gene, resulting in a trp78-to-ter (W78X)
substitution. Two of the patients had previously been described by
Bresolin et al. (1983) and Kissel et al. (1985). The third patient, a
17-year-old girl, complained of exercise intolerance since age 8 years;
intense exertion caused pain and cramps in the exercising muscles.
During episodes of myalgia, increases of serum creatine kinase were
documented but there was no pigmenturia. A brother complained of similar
exercise intolerance with cramps and had persistently elevated serum
creatine kinase. A fourth patient, also African American, was a compound
heterozygote for W78X and G89A (612931.0002). PGAM2 activities in all
patients were decreased to 2.1 to 6% of normal values.

.0002
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE X
PGAM2, GLU89ALA

In a 30-year-old African American man with GSD10 (261670), Tsujino et
al. (1993) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
PGAM2 gene: W78X (612931.0001) and an A-to-C transversion resulting in a
glu89-to-ala (E89A) substitution. He reported a history of pigmenturia
that appeared a few hours after he ran a race. Serum creatine kinase was
greatly elevated and myoglobin was demonstrated in the urine. He
developed renal failure that required hemodialysis. He had had 2 similar
episodes, at ages 21 and 22 years, both after strenuous exercise. PGAM2
activity was 2.6% of normal values.

.0003
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE X
PGAM2, ARG90TRP

In a 24-year-old Italian man, the first reported Caucasian with muscle
phosphoglycerate mutase deficiency (GSD10; 261670) (Vita et al., 1990),
Tsujino et al. (1993) demonstrated homozygosity for a C-to-T transition
in the PGAM2 gene, resulting in an arg90-to-trp (R90W) substitution. He
had episodes of myalgia, weakness, and pigmenturia after brief intense
exercise. PGAM2 activity was 6% of normal values.

.0004
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE X
PGAM2, GLY97ASP

In a Japanese family with partial PGAM2 deficiency (GSD10; 261670),
Hadjigeorgiou et al. (1999) identified a 209G-A transition in the PGAM2
gene, resulting in the substitution of a highly conserved glycine at
codon 97 with aspartic acid (G97D). Two family members heterozygous for
the G97D mutation presented with exercise intolerance and muscle cramps.
In at least 2 families, manifesting heterozygotes had previously been
described (Tsujino et al., 1993; Bresolin et al., 1983).

604948	TITLE *604948 GROWTH ARREST- AND DNA DAMAGE-INDUCIBLE GENE GADD45, BETA; GADD45B
;;MYD118, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; MYD118
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The stress-responsive p38 (see MAPK14; 600289) and JNK (see MAPK8;
601158) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways regulate cell
cycle and apoptosis. A human MAP3K, MTK1 (MAP3K4; 602425), mediates
activation of both p38 and JNK in response to environmental stresses. By
screening a placenta cDNA library using a yeast 2-hybrid method,
Takekawa and Saito (1998) isolated cDNAs encoding 3 related proteins,
GADD45-alpha (GADD45A; 126335), GADD45-beta (GADD45B), and GADD45-gamma
(GADD45G; 604949), that bound to an N-terminal domain of MTK1. The
deduced GADD45B protein contains 160 amino acids. GADD45A, GADD45B, and
GADD45G share 55 to 58% amino acid identity. These proteins activated
MTK1 kinase activity, both in vivo and in vitro. All 3 GADD45-like genes
were induced by environmental stresses, including methyl
methanesulfonate, UV, and gamma irradiation. Expression of the
GADD45-like genes induced p38/JNK activation and apoptosis, which could
be partially suppressed by coexpression of a dominant inhibitory MTK1
mutant protein. Northern blot analysis detected strong expression of a
1.4-kb GADD45B transcript in heart and liver, with moderate expression
in placenta, lung, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas, and little or
no expression in brain. Takekawa and Saito (1998) proposed that the
GADD45-like proteins mediate activation of the p38/JNK pathway, via
MTK1, in response to environmental stresses.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the GADD45B
gene to 19p13.3 (TMAP D20061).

GENE FUNCTION

Using RelA (164014)-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts and mouse T
cell hybridomas incapable of activation of NFKB (see 164011), De Smaele
et al. (2001) showed by Northern blot analysis that GADD45B is a TNFA
(191160)-inducible gene and a physiologic target of NFKB. Expression of
physiologic levels of GADD45B prevents, at least temporarily, cells not
expressing activated NFKB from apoptosis induced by TNFA by abrogating
caspase activation and mitochondrial depolarization. Western blot
analysis revealed that NFKB is required to terminate JNK (e.g., JNK1,
601158) signaling triggered by TNFR (191190). Antisense inhibition of
GADD45B led to prolonged JNK activation and cytotoxicity after TNFR
triggering. De Smaele et al. (2001) concluded that JNK is crucial to
programmed cell death induced by TNFR and that one mechanism by which
NFKB protects cells is the downregulation of the JNK cascade through the
transcriptional activation of GADD45B.

Ma et al. (2009) identified GADD45B as a neural activity-induced
immediate early gene in mature hippocampal neurons. Mice with Gadd45b
deletion exhibited specific deficits in neural activity-induced
proliferation of neural progenitors and dendritic growth of newborn
neurons in the adult hippocampus. Mechanistically, GADD45B is required
for activity-induced DNA demethylation of specific promoters and
expression of corresponding genes critical for adult neurogenesis,
including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; 113505) and
fibroblast growth factor (FGF; see 131220). Thus, Ma et al. (2009)
concluded that GADD45B links neuronal circuit activity to epigenetic DNA
modification and expression of secreted factors in mature neurons for
extrinsic modulation of neurogenesis in the adult brain.
