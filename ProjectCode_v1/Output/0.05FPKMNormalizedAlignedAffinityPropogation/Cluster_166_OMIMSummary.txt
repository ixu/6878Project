602344	TITLE *602344 PLATELET-ACTIVATING FACTOR ACETYLHYDROLASE 2; PAFAH2
DESCRIPTION Hattori et al. (1996) reported the cloning of a novel isoform of
platelet-activating factor (PAF) acetylhydrolase (AH), termed PAFAH2 by
the authors, from human tissue. PAFAH2 encodes a 392-amino acid
polypeptide with a predicted mass of approximately 43 kD. Other PAF
acetylhydrolases include the isoform found in plasma (PAFAH; 601690) and
isoform Ib (PAFAH1B1; 601545), which is found in brain and is associated
with lissencephaly (607432). Hattori et al. (1996) found that PAFAH2
shares approximately 43% identity with plasma PAFAH, but has virtually
no similarity to brain PAFAH1B1. Unlike PAFAH, PAFAH2 contains no
secretory signal sequence, confirming its intracellular localization.
Northern blotting of bovine tissue revealed that PAFAH2 is expressed at
highest level in liver and at lower levels in a variety of other
tissues.

DESCRIPTION For background information on histones, histone gene clusters, and the
H2B histone family, see HIST1H2BA (609904).

MAPPING

By analysis of a YAC contig from chromosome 6p21.3, Albig et al. (1997)
characterized a cluster of 35 histone genes that included H2B/h.

By genomic sequence analysis, Marzluff et al. (2002) determined that the
histone gene cluster on chromosome 6p22-p21, which they called histone
gene cluster-1 (HIST1), contains 55 histone genes, including HIST1H2BE.

GENE FUNCTION

See HIST1H2BA (609904) for functional information on H2B histones.
