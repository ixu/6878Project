DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

In mammals, lipoyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.181) catalyzes the second of 2
steps in the covalent attachment of lipoic acid to lipoate-dependent
proteins, including the glycine cleavage system H protein (GCSH; 238330)
and the dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase (E2) subunits of the pyruvate
dehydrogenase complex (DLAT; 608770), the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase
complex (DLST; 126063), and the branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase
complex (DBT; 248610) (Fujiwara et al., 1999).

CLONING

Using a bovine lipoyltransferase cDNA fragment as probe, Fujiwara et al.
(1999) cloned human LIPT1 from a liver cDNA library. The deduced
373-amino acid precursor protein shares 88% and 31% sequence identity
with bovine lipoyltransferase II and E. coli lipoate-protein ligase A,
respectively. By alignment of LIPT1 with the bovine lipoyltransferase
amino acid sequence, Fujiwara et al. (1999) predicted that the
N-terminal 26 amino acids comprise a mitochondrial targeting sequence,
with the threonine-27 corresponding to the first residue of the mature
enzyme. Thus, the deduced mature LIPT1 enzyme contains 347 amino acids
with a calculated molecular mass of 39.539 kD. Northern blot analysis
detected a major 1.5-kb transcript in all tissues examined, with highest
expression in skeletal muscle and heart, followed by liver, brain,
placenta, and lung.

GENE STRUCTURE

Fujiwara et al. (1999) determined that the LIPT1 gene contains 4 exons
and spans 8 kb of genomic DNA. They found evidence of several LIPT1
transcripts resulting from alternative splicing in the 5-prime
untranslated region.

MAPPING

By FISH, Fujiwara et al. (1999) mapped the LIPT1 gene to chromosome
2q11.2.

;;TPI
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Triosephosphate isomerase (TPI; EC 5.3.1.1) catalyzes the
interconversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (summary by Ationu et al., 1999).

CLONING

Electrophoretic variants of triosephosphate isomerase were identified by
the Galton Laboratory group (Hopkinson and Harris, 1971).

Brown et al. (1985) isolated the functional gene and 3 intronless
pseudogenes for human TPI from a recombinant DNA library. The
pseudogenes share a high degree of homology with the functional gene but
contain mutations that preclude synthesis of active TPI enzyme. Sequence
divergence indicated origin of the pseudogenes about 18 million years
ago. Brown et al. (1985) concluded that the human TPI gene family has
only 1 functional gene.

Yuan et al. (1979), on the basis of structural analysis, concluded that
the TPI-A and TPI-B isozymes are products of distinct structural loci.
Decker and Mohrenweiser (1981) presented evidence that triosephosphate
isomerase isozymes are the expression of a single structural locus. (The
existence of 2 TPI loci, both probably coded by chromosome 12, had been
suggested to explain the observed isozyme patterns.) They identified a
rare electrophoretic variant and found that the variant phenotype was
expressed in the TPI-B isozyme of both red cells and circulating
lymphocytes and was also expressed in the TPI-A isozyme of
mitogen-stimulated lymphoblasts.

GENE FUNCTION

TPI is a dimeric enzyme of identical subunits that is characterized by a
high constitutive level of activity in all tissues. It is involved in
both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, catalyzing the interconversion of
DHAP and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. TPI is one of the most efficient
enzymes known, enhancing proton transfer by a factor of 10(10), and is
the least rate-limiting step in glycolysis (summary by Watanabe et al.,
1996).

GENE STRUCTURE

Brown et al. (1985) found that the functional TPI1 gene spans 3.5 kb and
is split into 7 exons.

MAPPING

From study of 3 patients with different deletions of chromosome 12,
Rethore et al. (1976, 1977) concluded that the GAPD locus (138400) is on
the distal part of 12p, between 12p12.2 and 12pter, and that the LDHB
locus (150100) is on the middle third between 12p12.1 and 12p12.2. The
results for TPI were like those for GAPD, suggesting the same distal
localization.

Law and Kao (1978) summarized data suggesting the order
12pter--TPI--GAPD--SHMT (SHMT2; 138450) on chromosome 12. SHMT lies on
the proximal part of 12q between the centromere and PEPB (169900).

Brown et al. (1985) confirmed that the functional TPI gene is on
chromosome 12 whereas the pseudogenes are on other chromosomes.

Asakawa and Iida (1985) also found support for a single TPI locus. GPI
(172400) and PEPD (613230), which are on chromosome 19 in man, are on
chromosome 9 of the Chinese hamster, and TPI, which is on chromosome 12
of man, is on Chinese hamster chromosome 8 (Siciliano et al., 1983).

OTHER FEATURES

TPI was 1 of 4 representative 'ancient' proteins used by Stoltzfus et
al. (1994) to test the exon theory of genes. Spliceosomal introns are
present in the nuclear protein-coding genes of most eukaryotic
organisms, but they have not been detected in several eukaryotic protist
phyla or in eubacteria, archaebacteria, and organelles. Two major
theories had emerged in the continuing debate on the origin of these
introns. The exon theory of genes (sometimes called the introns-early
view) proposed that exons are the descendants of ancient mini-genes and
introns are the descendants of the spaces between them; genes large
enough to encode contemporary proteins were first assembled from sets of
exons; the machinery of splicing originated in an ancient RNA world; and
introns were lost completely from both kingdoms of bacteria as well as
several protist groups. In contrast, the insertional theory of intron
origin (also known as the introns-late view) holds that split genes
arise from uninterrupted genes by insertion of introns; genes large
enough to encode contemporary proteins first arose (presumably from
smaller genes) without the participation of introns; the machinery of
spliceosomal splicing arose from fragmented self-splicing introns; and
spliceosomal introns were never present in the ancestors of those
organisms that now lack them. The analysis performed by Stoltzfus et al.
(1994) on TPI, the globins, pyruvate kinase, and alcohol dehydrogenase
demonstrated no significant correspondence between exons and units of
protein structure, suggesting that the putative correspondence does not
exist and that the exon theory of genes is untenable.

The chicken-and-egg question of which came first--exons or introns--was
studied, using TPI as a model, also by Kwiatowski et al. (1995) and
Logsdon et al. (1995). Each group looked at the positions of introns in
homologous TPI genes from a number of phylogenetically diverse species.
Both groups concluded that introns were gained comparatively recently in
eukaryotic evolution by insertion into preexisting genes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Eber et al. (1979) identified 5 persons heterozygous for a TPI null
allele.

Maquat et al. (1985) concluded that the genetic basis of TPI deficiency
is heterogeneous: normal levels of TPI mRNA were found in 1 homozygote
and about 40% of normal in another. The rare homozygous deficient
persons usually have 3 to 10% of normal enzyme activity.

Daar et al. (1986) and Pekrun et al. (1995) identified homoygosity for a
glu104-to-asp (E104D; 190450.0001) mutation in the TPI1 gene in patients
with triosephosphate deficiency. Arya et al. (1997) found that among 7
unrelated Northern European kindreds with clinical TPI deficiency, the
glu104-to-asp mutation accounted for 11 of 14 (79%) mutant alleles.
Haplotype analysis supported a founder effect.

Studies by Boyer et al. (1989) and Boyer and Maquat (1990) identified
several sequences in the 5-prime region that appear to be required for
maintenance of normal levels of gene expression. These include a CAP
proximal element (CPE) spanning nucleotides -6 and -12. The -5A-G and
-8G-A substitutions identified by Watanabe et al. (1996) are located
within the CPE region. The observation that all 7 affected individuals
shared the same variant CPE allele, an allele that does not exist at
higher frequency in the general African American population, suggested
to the authors a common origin for this TPI-deficiency allele; how the
allele frequency is maintained at such a high level was unclear.

Watanabe et al. (1996) undertook the molecular characterization of the
variant alleles from 7 African American and 3 Caucasian individuals from
the unrelated group identified in the frequency studies. In Caucasians
they found 3 amino acid substitutions, all in residues that are not
directly involved in the enzyme's active site but are highly conserved
through evolutionary time, suggesting important roles for these residues
in maintenance of subunit structure and conformation. One of the amino
acid substitutions, glu104-to-asp (190450.0001), had been previously
identified in cases of hemolytic anemia due to TPI deficiency. The
variant allele in the 7 African American individuals had nucleotide
changes at positions -8 and -5 on the 5-prime side of the
transcription-initiation site.

In a study of 424 African American subjects and 75 white subjects,
Schneider et al. (1998) found that the -5 (592A-G), -8 (382G-A), and -24
(573T-G) variants in the triosephosphate isomerase gene occurred
frequently (41%) in the African American subjects but did not occur in
whites. These data suggested that this set of polymorphisms may be one
of the higher-incidence molecular markers of African lineage. Although
the variant substitutions (occurring in 3 haplotypes: -5 alone, -5 -8,
and -5 -8 -24) were associated with moderate reduction in enzyme
activity, severe deficiency heterozygotes could not be identified with
certainty, and none of the haplotypes was restricted to subjects with
marked reduction of enzyme activity. Three subjects were homozygous for
the -5 -8 haplotype, a finding inconsistent with the putative role of
this haplotype as the cause of a null variant incompatible with life in
homozygotes, as had been suggested in the past for the rarity of
homozygotes with TPI deficiency in African Americans. Despite these
findings, Schneider et al. (1998) admitted the possibility that the -5
-8 or -5 -8 -24 haplotypes may in some instances contribute to compound
heterozygosity and clinical TPI deficiency.

ANIMAL MODEL

Gnerer et al. (2006) identified a recessive hypomorphic mutation in
Drosophila, which they called 'wasted away' (wstd), that causes
progressive motor impairment, vacuolar neuropathology, and severely
reduced life span. They found that wstd was caused by a mutation in the
Tpi1 gene. The mutation did not result in a significant deficit in ATP,
and the authors suggested that the lack of TPI1 activity may cause the
accumulation of toxic metabolites upstream of the enzymatic block.

HISTORY

From studies in the cri-du-chat syndrome (123450), Sparkes et al. (1969)
suggested that the TPI locus is on the short arm of chromosome 5. Others
failed to confirm this (Brock and Singer, 1970). Cell hybridization
studies indicated that the TPI locus is on chromosome 12.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
TRIOSEPHOSPHATE ISOMERASE DEFICIENCY
TPI1, GLU104ASP

In 2 unrelated patients with TPI deficiency (615512), Daar et al. (1986)
found a guanine-to-cytosine transversion in the codon for amino acid
104, resulting in a structurally altered protein in which a glutamate
residue was replaced by an aspartate residue. The importance of
glutamate-104 to enzyme structure and function was indicated by its
conservation in the TPI protein of all species characterized to date.
The glutamate-to-aspartate substitution resulted in a thermolabile
enzyme. The same mutation was identified in an Australian family by
Chang et al. (1993). The alteration of codon 104 was from GAG to GAC.

Pekrun et al. (1995) found this same mutation in a family with severe
TPI deficiency. The 1-year-old index patient suffered from hemolytic
anemia, neuromuscular impairment, and recurrent pneumonia, with the
necessity of intermittent mechanical ventilation. TPI activity in red
cells was reduced to about 20% of normal. Heat stability of the enzyme
was strongly reduced; concentration of the physiologic substrate,
dihydroxyacetone phosphate, was increased 20-fold due to the metabolic
block. During a second pregnancy, examination of a cord blood sample
obtained in the nineteenth gestational week showed that the infant was
homozygous normal. An unaffected, healthy newborn was delivered. The
parents were consanguineous and of Turkish origin.

Arya et al. (1997) found that among 7 unrelated Northern European
kindreds with clinical TPI deficiency, the glu104-to-asp mutation
accounted for 11 (79%) of 14 mutant alleles. In 3 families, molecular
analysis revealed compound heterozygosity for glu104 to asp and novel
missense mutations (see 190450.0004 and 190450.0005). The origin of the
glu104-to-asp mutation was defined by haplotype analysis using a novel
G/A polymorphism at nucleotide 2898 of the TPI gene. Cosegregation of
the low frequency 2898A allele with the G-to-C base change at nucleotide
315, responsible for the glu104-to-asp amino acid substitution,
supported a single origin for that mutation, i.e., founder effect.

.0002
TRIOSEPHOSPHATE ISOMERASE MANCHESTER
TPI-MANCHESTER
TPI1, GLY122ARG

In a screening of more than 3,400 persons in an Ann Arbor, Michigan,
population, Perry and Mohrenweiser (1992) found only 1 example of a TPI
electromorph variant. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of
polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified DNA products and subsequent
direct sequencing identified a G-to-A transition causing a replacement
of gly122 with arg in this electrophoretic mobility variant of TPI which
was referred to as TPI-Manchester. The substitution was at the amino
terminus or solvent interaction end of the fifth beta sheet of the
alpha/beta barrel structure. TPI-Manchester was found to be thermolabile
but the stability of the variant enzyme was not sensitive to other
denaturants.

.0003
TRIOSEPHOSPHATE ISOMERASE DEFICIENCY
TPI-HUNGARY
TPI1, PHE240LEU

In a Hungarian family, Chang et al. (1993) found that the proband with
TPI deficiency (615512), who had chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia
but no neuromuscular disabilities, was a genetic compound. One of the
mutations was a missense mutation within codon 240 that changed TTC
(phe) to CTC (leu) and created a thermolabile protein. The substitution
occurred in a phylogenetically conserved amino acid and affected enzyme
activity by disrupting intersubunit contacts or substrate binding, as
deduced from enzyme structural studies. The nature of the other mutation
was not identified (see 190450.0006), but it had the effect of reducing
the abundance of TPI mRNA 10- to 20-fold. The same family was also
reported by Hollan et al. (1993) who gave clinical details on the
13-year-old boy with congenital hemolytic anemia and hyperkinetic
torsion dyskinesia associated with severe TPI deficiency, and on his
brother, a 23-year-old amateur wrestler, who also had congenital
hemolytic anemia but no neurologic symptoms. The latter was the proband
in the study of Chang et al. (1993), which demonstrated compound
heterozygosity. (Hollan et al. (1993) incorrectly referred to the
brothers as being double heterozygotes.) Both had less than 10% TPI
activity and a greatly increased dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) level
in their red blood cells. Their TPI had a slow electrophoretic mobility
and was heat unstable. Both parents and a third brother were healthy
heterozygotes. The older brother represented a unique phenotype since
all published homozygotes had severe neurologic alterations from infancy
or early childhood except 1 infant who died at 11 months, probably too
young for neurologic symptoms to be noted. Furthermore, in contrast to
the 2 affected Hungarian brothers, all but 1 homozygote had died before
the age of 6 years.

.0004
TRIOSEPHOSPHATE ISOMERASE DEFICIENCY
TPI1, CYS41TYR

In 2 families with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency (615512), Arya
et al. (1997) found compound heterozygosity for the common glu104-to-asp
mutation (190450.0001) and a previously unknown missense mutation, cys41
to tyr, due to a TGT-to-TAT transition.

.0005
TRIOSEPHOSPHATE ISOMERASE DEFICIENCY
TPI1, ILE170VAL

In a family with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency (615512), Arya et
al. (1997) found that affected individuals showed compound
heterozygosity for the common glu104-to-asp substitution (190450.0001)
and a novel ile170-to-val missense mutation.

.0006
TRIOSEPHOSPHATE ISOMERASE DEFICIENCY
TPI1, GLU145TER

In a Hungarian family with severe TPI deficiency (615512) originally
described by Chang et al. (1993), Orosz et al. (2001) analyzed 2
germline-identical but phenotypically different brothers who were
compound heterozygotes for the F240L mutation (190450.0003) and a
glu145-to-ter (E145X) mutation. The kinetic, thermodynamic, and
associative properties of the recombinant human wildtype and F240L
mutant enzymes were compared with those of TPIs in normal and deficient
erythrocyte hemolysates. The specific activity of the recombinant mutant
enzyme relative to the wildtype was much higher (30%) than expected from
the activity (3%) measured in hemolysates. Comparative studies of the
hemolysate from a British patient with glu104-to-asp (190450.0001)
homozygosity (Ationu et al., 1999) and the platelet lysates from the
Hungarian family suggested that the microcompartmentation of TPI is not
unique for the hemolysates from the Hungarian TPI-deficient brothers.

603084	TITLE *603084 ASPARTYL-tRNA SYNTHETASE; DARS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The DARS gene encodes cytoplasmic aspartyl-tRNA synthetase.
Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases constitute a family of enzymes catalyzing the
specific aminoacylation of cognate tRNA in the initial step of
ribosome-dependent protein biosynthesis. Mammalian synthetases differ
from those of prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes in that they associate as
multienzyme complexes (summary by Jacobo-Molina et al., 1989).

CLONING

By screening a HeLa cell cDNA library with a rat Dars cDNA cloned by
them, Jacobo-Molina et al. (1989) isolated a cDNA encoding DARS. The
predicted DARS protein has 500 amino acids and a calculated molecular
mass of 57,000 Da. The human DARS protein has 95% amino acid identity
with rat Dars and shares unevenly distributed identity with yeast
aspartyl-tRNA synthetase, with 69% identity at the C-terminal half and
46% identity at the N-terminal half. The authors discussed several
potential functional domains in the DAR protein, including a region of
conserved lysine residues which is also found in bacterial and yeast
synthetases and is likely to be the binding site for the 3-prime end of
tRNA, a nucleotide triphosphate-binding motif, an ATP-binding motif with
strong similarity to that present in E. coli alanyl-tRNA synthetase, and
a cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site.
Jacobo-Molina et al. (1989) predicted a neutral amphiphilic helix at the
N-terminal end of the DARS protein and stated that this structure does
not occur in other known synthetases from bacteria, yeast, and higher
organisms.

Based on a curated set of publicly available data, Taft et al. (2013)
found that Dars is diffusely localized in the cytoplasm and broadly
expressed across tissue types, including the central nervous system. In
mice, Dars showed specific expression in neurons of the hippocampus, the
dentate gyrus, and the molecular layer of the cerebellum. DARS
expression in the developing and adult human brain showed a similar
pattern, with preferential immunostaining of neurons in the cerebellum,
cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and lateral ventricle. In addition,
staining of peripheral neurons was evident in the colon.

MAPPING

Gross (2012) mapped the DARS gene to chromosome 2q21.3 based on an
alignment of the DARS sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC000629) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 10 patients from 7 unrelated families of various origins with
hypomyelination with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and
spasticity (HBSL; 615281), Taft et al. (2013) identified homozygous or
compound heterozygous mutations in the DARS gene (see, e.g.,
603084.0001-603084.0006). The mutations, which were found by exome
sequencing, occurred in the 3-prime third of DARS, which corresponds to
the C-terminal active-site domain of the enzyme. The phenotype was
characterized by onset in the first year of life of severe spasticity,
mainly affecting the lower limbs and resulting in an inability to
achieve independent ambulation. Affected individuals showed delayed
motor development and nystagmus; 4 patients had mild mental retardation.
Brain MRI showed hypomyelination and white matter lesions in the
cerebrum, brainstem, cerebellum, and spinal cord. Taft et al. (2013)
noted the phenotypic similarities to leukoencephalopathy with brainstem
and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation (LBSL; 611105), which
is caused by mutation in the DARS2 gene (610956).

In an Australian boy with hypomyelination with brainstem and spinal cord
involvement and leg spasticity (HBSL; 615281), Taft et al. (2013)
identified compound heterozygous mutations in the DARS gene: a c.1099G-T
transversion in exon 11, resulting in an asp367-to-tyr (D367Y)
substitution, and a c.821C-T transition in exon 10, resulting in an
ala274-to-val (A274V; dbSNP rs112205661; 603084.0002) substitution. Both
mutations occurred at conserved residues in the active-site pocket. The
mutations, which were identified by whole-genome sequencing and
confirmed by Sanger sequencing, segregated with the disorder in the
family. The D367Y mutation was not found in several large control
databases, while the A274V mutation was found at a frequency of 0.001%.

In 2 sibs and 2 additional unrelated patients of Indian or Pakistani

c.766A-C transversion in exon 9 of the DARS gene, resulting in a
met256-to-leu (M256L) substitution at a conserved residue. The mutation,
which was initially found by whole-exome sequencing, was not present in

may alter an amino acid likely to be fundamental to chains supporting

in an arg487-to-cys (R487C) substitution at a conserved residue. The
mutation, which was found by whole-exome sequencing, was not present in

is likely to destabilize the tRNA-protein interaction.

transition in exon 15, resulting in an arg460-to-his (R460H)
substitution at a conserved residue, and a c.1480C-T transition in exon
16, resulting in an arg494-to-gly (R494G; dbSNP rs147077598;
603084.0006) substitution at a conserved residue. Molecular modeling
suggested that the R460H mutation may alter an amino acid likely to be
fundamental to chains supporting the active site, and that the R494G
mutation is likely to destabilize the tRNA-protein interaction. The
R460H mutation was not found in several large control databases, while
the R494G mutation was found at a frequency of 0.001%.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening human brain cDNAs for the potential to encode proteins that
are at least 50 kD, Nagase et al. (1998) isolated an SLC21A9 cDNA, which
they called KIAA0880, that contains a complete coding sequence. The
predicted 709-amino acid SLC21A9 protein contains 8 membrane-spanning
regions. SLC21A9 shares 42.8% amino acid sequence identity with a rat
prostaglandin transporter across 678 residues. RT-PCR followed by ELISA
detected SLC21A9 expression in all human tissues examined, with the
highest expression in liver, lower expression in lung, ovary, brain,
heart, kidney, pancreas, spleen, and testis, and lowest expression in
skeletal muscle.

By searching EST databases for sequences similar to OATP (SLCO1A2;
602883), followed by RT-PCR of adult brain RNA, Tamai et al. (2000)
cloned SLCO2B1, which they designated OATPB. The deduced 709-amino acid
protein has 12 potential transmembrane regions and several
phosphorylation and N-glycosylation sites. RT-PCR detected OATPB
expression in adult pancreas, liver, lung, gut, ovary, testis, and
spleen, and in all fetal tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs) are a family of
multispecific carriers that mediate the sodium-independent transport of
steroid hormone and conjugates, drugs, and numerous anionic endogenous
substrates. St-Pierre et al. (2002) investigated whether members of the
OATP gene family could mediate fetal-maternal transfer of anionic
steroid conjugates in the human placenta. They isolated OATPB from a
placenta cDNA library. An antiserum to OATPB detected an 85-kD protein
in basal but not apical syncytiotrophoblast membranes.
Immunohistochemistry of first-, second-, and third-trimester placenta
showed staining in the cytotrophoblast membranes and at the basal
surface of the syncytiotrophoblast. Trophoblasts that reacted with an
antibody to Ki-67, a proliferation-associated antigen, expressed lower
levels of OATPB. OATPB mRNA levels were measured in isolated
trophoblasts under culture conditions that promoted syncytia formation.
Real-time quantitative PCR estimated an 8-fold increase in OATPB
expression on differentiation to syncytia. Pregnenolone sulfate
partially inhibited OATPB-mediated transport of estrone-3-sulfate in an
oocyte expression system. The authors concluded that these findings
suggested a physiologic role for OATPB in the placental uptake of
fetal-derived sulfated steroids.

Tamai et al. (2000) overexpressed OATPB in HEK293 cells and found that
it mediated transport of estrone-3-sulfate and, more weakly,
prostaglandin E2.

MAPPING

By analysis of a radiation hybrid mapping panel, Nagase et al. (1998)
mapped the SLC21A9 gene to chromosome 11. By radiation hybrid analysis,
Tamai et al. (2000) mapped the SLCO2B1 gene to chromosome 11, between
markers D11S916 and D11S911.

;;AT3;;
MJD GENE; MJD1;;
SCA3 GENE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ATXN3 has deubiquitinase activity and appears to be a component of the
ubiquitin proteasome system. It may also have roles in transcriptional
regulation and neuroprotection (summary by Haacke et al., 2006).

CLONING

To identify the gene affected by CAG expansion in Machado-Joseph disease
(MJD; 109150), Kawaguchi et al. (1994) isolated a cDNA with a CAG repeat
from a human brain cDNA library using an oligonucleotide probe with 13
CTG repeats, complementary to the CAG repeats. The cDNA, which they
designated MJD1, encodes a deduced 359-amino acid protein.

Goto et al. (1997) obtained 3 ATXN3 cDNAs from a human brain cDNA
library. Two of the cDNAs represent an ATXN3 variant that differs from
the cDNA reported by Kawaguchi et al. (1994) in splicing of the 3-prime
exons, resulting in a different C-terminal sequence in the protein. The
third cDNA has a stop codon polymorphism that results in additional
C-terminal amino acids. The deduced ATXN3 proteins, which range in size
from 360 to 374 amino acids, differ only at their C termini and in the
number of glutamines in the polyglutamine (polyQ) tract.

Schmitt et al. (1997) isolated rat Atxn3. They found that the rat and
human ATXN3 genes are highly homologous, with an overall sequence
identity of approximately 88%. However, the C-terminal end of the
putative rat protein differs strongly from the human sequence published
by Kawaguchi et al. (1994). The (CAG)n block in the rat cDNA consists of
only 3 interrupted units, suggesting that a long polyQ stretch is not
essential for normal function of the Atxn3 protein in rodents.
Transcription of rat Atxn3 was detected in most rat tissues, including
brain. In human brain sections, Schmitt et al. (1997) did not find
significantly higher ATXN3 mRNA levels in regions predominantly affected
in MJD, suggesting that additional molecules and/or regulatory events
are necessary to explain the exclusive degeneration of certain brain
areas in MJD.

Using immunohistochemistry of normal and MJD brain, Paulson et al.
(1997) showed that expression of ATXN3 was restricted to a limited
subset of neurons, particularly to those in the striatum. In normal and
diseased brain and in transfected cells, immunolocalization studies
revealed that ATXN3 was predominantly a cytoplasmic protein that
localized to neuronal processes as well.

Tait et al. (1998) studied the subcellular localization of full-length
ataxin-3 protein with a glutamine sequence in the normal range in 2
mammalian cell lines. By immunofluorescence and confocal laser scanning
microscopy, and by biochemical subcellular fractionations, they detected
the protein predominantly, but not exclusively, in the nucleus. The
ataxin-3 present in the nucleus of neuroblastoma cells associated with
the inner nuclear matrix. The authors concluded that the ataxin-3
protein, which contains a putative nuclear localization signal very
close to the glutamine tract, per se has the ability to be transported
into the nucleus and that an expanded glutamine repeat is not essential
for this transport.

Using Northern blot analysis, Ichikawa et al. (2001) showed that ATXN3
mRNA was ubiquitously expressed in human tissues. They detected at least
4 ATXN3 transcripts of 1.4, 1.8, 4.5, and 7.5 kb and suggested that the
different mRNA species probably result from differential splicing and
polyadenylation.

Burnett et al. (2003) stated that the major human AT3 isoform contains
an N-terminal deubiquitinating domain, called the Josephin domain,
followed by 2 ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs) and a polyQ tract near
the C terminus. In some isoforms, the polyQ tract is followed by a third
UIM. Burnett et al. (2003) identified a catalytic triad of cys14,
his119, and asn134 and other highly conserved residues within the
Josephin domain of AT3.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ichikawa et al. (2001) determined that the ATXN3 gene spans 48,240 bp
and contains 11 exons.

MAPPING

By FISH, Kawaguchi et al. (1994) mapped the ATXN3 gene to chromosome
14q32.1.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a 2-hybrid system, Wang et al. (2000) found that ataxin-3
interacted with 2 human homologs of the yeast DNA repair protein RAD23,
HHR23A (RAD23A; 600061) and HHR23B (RAD23B; 600062). Both normal and
mutant ataxin-3 proteins interacted with the ubiquitin-like domain at
the N terminus of the HHR23 proteins, which is a motif important for
nucleotide excision repair. However, in HEK 293 cells, HHR23A was
recruited to intranuclear inclusions formed by the mutant ataxin-3 (see
MOLECULAR GENETICS) through its interaction with ataxin-3. The authors
suggested that this interaction may be associated with the normal
function of ataxin-3, and that some functional abnormality of the HHR23
proteins may exist in MJD.

By combining profile-based sequence analysis with genomewide functional
data in model organisms, Scheel et al. (2003) determined that ataxin-3
belongs to a novel group of cysteine proteases and is predicted to be
active against ubiquitin chains or related substrates. The catalytic
site of this enzyme class is similar to that found in UBP (see USP1;
603478)- and UCH (see UCHL3; 603090)-type ubiquitin proteases. They
suggested the finding had implications for disease pathogenesis by
providing a direct connection between SCA3 and ubiquitin metabolism.

Doss-Pepe et al. (2003) showed that both normal and polyQ-expanded human
ATXN3 associated with a number of proteasome subunits and with
ubiquitinated proteins. Truncation analysis showed that the UIMs of
ATXN3 bound polyubiquitin, but other factors in the full-length protein
increased the affinity of ATXN3 for polyubiquitin. Both normal and
polyQ-expanded ATXN3 inhibited formation of ubiquitin-conjugated histone
H2B (see 609904).

Burnett et al. (2003) showed that the UIM domain of AT3 bound ubiquitin
chains containing 4 or more ubiquitin units, the chain length required
for proteasome degradation. PolyQ-expanded AT3 showed similar binding to
ubiquitin chains. Both wildtype and pathologic AT3 also decreased the
degree of polyubiquitination of the test protein, iodinated lysosome,
suggesting that AT3 is a ubiquitin protease. AT3 was sensitive to a
specific ubiquitin protease inhibitor. Mutation of cys14 within the
Josephin domain to alanine reduced the ability of AT3 to remove
polyubiquitin chains from iodinated lysosome.

Winborn et al. (2008) showed that human ATXN3 bound both lys48- and
lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains, but preferentially cleaved lys63
linkages. ATXN3 showed greater activity toward mixed-linkage
polyubiquitin, cleaving lys63 linkages in chains that contained both
lys48 and lys63 linkages. PolyQ expansion did not alter the binding or
catalytic properties of ATXN3. The authors concluded that ATXN3 is a
mixed-linkage, chain-editing enzyme and that the UIM region of ATXN3
regulates its substrate specificity.

Mueller et al. (2009) showed that protein casein kinase-2 (CK2, see
115440)-dependent phosphorylation controlled the nuclear localization,
aggregation, and stability of ataxin-3. Ser340 and ser352 within the
third ubiquitin-interacting motif of ATXN3 were particularly important
for nuclear localization of normal and expanded ATXN3, and mutation of
these sites robustly reduced the formation of nuclear inclusions. A
putative nuclear leader sequence was not required. ATXN3 associated with
CK2-alpha (CSNK2A1; 115440), and pharmacologic inhibition of CK2
decreased nuclear ATXN3 levels and the formation of nuclear inclusions.
ATXN3 shifted to the nucleus upon thermal stress in a CK2-dependent
manner, suggesting a key role of CK2-mediated phosphorylation of ATXN3
in SCA3 pathophysiology.

Reina et al. (2010) showed that interactions of ATXN3 with
valosin-containing protein (VCP; 601023) and HHR23B were dynamic and
modulated by proteotoxic stresses. Heat shock, a general proteotoxic
stress, also induced wildtype and pathogenic ATXN3 to accumulate in the
nucleus. Mapping studies showed that 2 regions of ATXN3, the Josephin
domain and the C terminus, regulated heat shock-induced nuclear
localization. Atxn3-null mouse cells were more sensitive to toxic
effects of heat shock, suggesting that ATXN3 had a protective function
in the cellular response to heat shock. Oxidative stress also induced
nuclear localization of ATXN3; both wildtype and pathogenic ATXN3
accumulated in the nucleus of SCA3 patient fibroblasts following
oxidative stress. Heat shock and oxidative stress were the first
processes identified that increased nuclear localization of ATXN3. Reina
et al. (2010) suggested that the nucleus may be a key site for early
pathogenesis of SCA3.

Koch et al. (2011) showed that L-glutamate-induced excitation of
patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons
initiates calcium-dependent proteolysis of ATXN3 followed by the
formation of SDS-insoluble aggregates. This phenotype could be abolished
by calpain (see 114220) inhibition, confirming a key role of this
protease in ATXN3 aggregation. Aggregate formation was further dependent
on functional sodium and potassium channels as well as ionotropic and
voltage-gated calcium channels, and was not observed in iPSCs,
fibroblasts, or glia, thereby providing an explanation for the
neuron-specific phenotype of Machado-Joseph disease. Koch et al. (2011)
concluded that iPSCs enable the study of aberrant protein processing
associated with late-onset neurodegenerative disorders in
patient-specific neurons.

Using immunoprecipitation analysis and protein pull-down studies, Araujo
et al. (2011) found that endogenous ATXN3 interacted directly with the
transcription factor FOXO4 (300033) in nuclear extracts of HeLa cells,
rat CSM14.1 mesencephalic cells, and mouse brain. The interaction
required the N-terminal Josephin domain of ATXN3. Expression of ATXN3
enhanced FOXO4-dependent expression of the antioxidant enzyme SOD2
(147460) in a manner independent of ATXN3 deubiquitinase activity.
Treatment of HeLa cells with H2O2 induced nuclear translocation of FOXO4
and ATXN3, enhanced binding of FOXO4 and ATXN3 to the SOD2 promoter, and
induced SOD2 expression. Coexpression of mutant ATXN3 with an expanded
polyglutamine tract or knockdown of ATXN3 via short hairpin RNA reduced
FOXO4 nuclear translocation and induction of SOD2. Lymphocytes from SCA3
patients exposed to oxidative stress showed reduced binding of FOXO4 to
the SOD2 promoter, concomitant with impaired upregulation of SOD2 and
enhanced oxidative cytotoxicity. Araujo et al. (2011) concluded that
ATXN3 stabilizes FOXO4 and acts as a transcriptional coactivator with
FOXO4 in the oxidative stress response.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- CAG Expansion in ATXN3 in Machado-Joseph Disease

In 8 of 9 patients with clinically diagnosed MJD, Kawaguchi et al.
(1994) identified CAG expansions of between 68 to 79 in the ATXN3 gene
(607047.0001). In normal individuals, the ATXN3 gene was found to
contain between 13 and 36 CAG repeats.

Kawaguchi et al. (1994) found a negative correlation between age of
onset and CAG repeat numbers. Southern blot analyses and genomic cloning
demonstrated the existence of related genes and raised the possibility
that similar abnormalities in related genes may give rise to diseases
similar to MJD.

- Pathogenic Effects of Polyglutamine Expansion in ATXN3

Paulson et al. (1997) showed that ATXN3 with a polyglutamine sequence in
the pathologic range accumulated in ubiquitinated intranuclear
inclusions selectively in neurons of affected brain regions. They
provided evidence in vitro for a model of disease in which an expanded
polyglutamine-containing fragment recruits full-length protein into
insoluble aggregates.

Evert et al. (1999) generated ataxin-3-expressing rat mesencephalic
CSM14.1 cells to study the effects of long-term expression of ataxin-3.
The isolated stable cell lines provided high level expression of human
full-length ataxin-3 with either the normal nonexpanded CAG repeats
(SCA3-Q23) or the pathogenic expanded CAG repeats (SCA3-Q70). When
cultured at a nonpermissive temperature (39 degrees C), CSM14.1 cells
expressing the expanded full-length ataxin-3 developed nuclear inclusion
bodies, strong indentations of the nuclear envelope, and cytoplasmic
vacuolation, whereas cells expressing the nonexpanded form and control
cells did not. The ultrastructural alterations resembled those found in
affected neurons of SCA3 patients. Cells with such changes exhibited
increased spontaneous nonapoptotic cell death.

Gaspar et al. (2000) explored the possibility that frameshift mutations
in expanded CAG tracts of ATXN3 can generate polyalanine mutant proteins
and form intranuclear inclusions. Antisera were raised against a
synthetic peptide corresponding to the C terminus of ATXN3, which would
result from a frameshift within the CAG repeat motif with an intervening
polyalanine stretch. Corresponding proteins were evident in MJD patients
by Western blot analysis of lymphoblastoid proteins and in situ
hybridization of MJD pontine neurons. Transfection experiments suggested
that frameshifts are more likely to occur in longer CAG repeats and that
alanine polymers alone may be harmful to cells. The authors suggested
that a similar pathogenic mechanism may occur in other CAG repeat
disorders.

Toulouse et al. (2005) established a cellular model of transcript
frameshifting of expanded CAG tracts, resulting from ribosomal slippage
to the -1 frame exclusively. Ribosomal frameshifting depended on the
presence of long CAG tracts, and polyalanine-frameshifted proteins may
enhance polyglutamine-associated toxicity, possibly contributing to
pathogenesis. Anisomycin, a ribosome-interacting drug that reduces -1
frameshifting, also reduced toxicity, suggesting a therapeutic
opportunity for these disorders.

Haacke et al. (2006) found that full-length recombinant human AT3 formed
detergent-resistant fibrillar aggregates in vitro with extremely low
efficiency, even when it contained a pathogenic polyQ tract of 71
residues (AT3Q71). However, an N-terminally truncated form, called
257cQ71, which began with residue 257 and contained only the C terminus
with an expanded polyQ region, readily formed detergent-insoluble
aggregates and recruited full-length nonpathogenic AT3Q22 into the
aggregates. The efficiency of recruitment increased with expansion of
the polyQ stretch. FRET analysis revealed that the interaction of AT3Q22
with the polyQ tract of 257cQ71 caused a conformational change that
affected the active-site cysteine within the Josephin domain of AT3Q22.
Similar results were found in vivo with transfected mouse neuroblastoma
cells: 257cQ71 formed inclusions in almost all cells, and full-length
AT3 proteins did not readily aggregate unless coexpressed with 257cQ71.
AT3Q71 also formed inclusions, but it appeared to do so following its
partial degradation. Use of an engineered protease-sensitive form of AT3
suggested that release of expanded polyQ fragments initiates the
formation of cellular inclusions. Haacke et al. (2006) concluded that
recruitment of functional AT3 into aggregates by expanded
polyQ-containing fragments reduces cellular AT3 content and thus impairs
its function.

- Suppression of Mutant ATXN3

In animal cell models, Miller et al. (2003) demonstrated that
allele-specific silencing of disease genes with small interfering RNA
(siRNA) could be achieved by targeting either a linked SNP or the
disease mutation directly. They determined that selective targeting of
the disease-causing CAG repeat in the ATXN3 gene was not possible and
then took advantage of an associated SNP to generate siRNA that
exclusively silenced the mutant ATXN3 allele while sparing expression of
the wildtype allele. Allele-specific suppression was accomplished with
all 3 siRNA delivery approaches in use at the time: in vitro-synthesized
duplexes and plasmid and viral expression of short hairpin RNA.

In vitro, Li et al. (2004) found that an siRNA targeted to a C/G
polymorphism immediately after the CAG repeat that is expanded in MJD
effectively suppressed expression of mutant ataxin-3 (79 repeats) by 96%
without significant effect on the wildtype protein. In addition, siRNA
decreased cell death by 63 to 76%.

- Susceptibility to Late-Onset Parkinson Disease

In a family of African descent in which 3 members presented with
phenotypic features reminiscent of typical Parkinson disease (168600),
Gwinn-Hardy et al. (2001) identified pathogenic expansions in the ATXN3
gene. Features suggestive of PD included bradykinesis, facial masking,
rigidity, postural instability, shuffling, asymmetric onset, dopamine
responsiveness, and lack of atypical features often associated with
SCA3. A fourth, mildly symptomatic patient also carried the repeat
expansion. The authors suggested that the low numbers of repeats in this
family (67-75; normal, 16-34) presenting with parkinsonism may be
associated with ethnic background and that evaluation for SCA3 should be
considered in similar cases.

EVOLUTION

By comparing wildtype haplotypes encompassing the ATXN3 CAG repeat in
431 chromosomes of European, Asian, and African origin, Martins et al.
(2006) concluded that the main mutation mechanism occurring in the
evolution of the polymorphic CAG repeat is a multistep process resulting
from gene conversion or DNA slippage, as opposed to a stepwise process.
The 4 most frequent haplotypes showed a bimodal CAG repeat length
frequency distribution, particularly in the European population, and
genetic distances among all the alleles from each population did not
reflect allele size differences.

ANIMAL MODEL

- Transgenic Rodent Models of Machado-Joseph Disease

Cemal et al. (2002) generated transgenic mice by introducing pathologic
ATXN3 alleles with polyglutamine tract lengths of 64, 67, 72, 76, and 84
repeats, as well as the wildtype with 15 repeats. The mice with expanded
alleles demonstrated a mild and slowly progressive cerebellar deficit,
manifesting as early as 4 weeks of age. As the disease progressed,
pelvic elevation became markedly flattened and was accompanied by
hypotonia and motor and sensory loss. Neuronal intranuclear inclusion
formation and cell loss was prominent in the pontine and dentate nuclei,
with variable cell loss in other regions of the cerebellum from 4 weeks
of age. Peripheral nerve demyelination and axonal loss was also detected
in symptomatic mice from 26 weeks of age. In contrast, transgenic mice
carrying the wildtype (CAG)15 allele of the ATXN3 locus appeared
completely normal at 20 months. Disease severity increased with the
level of expression of the expanded protein and the size of the repeat.

Boy et al. (2009) generated a conditional mouse model of SCA3.
Transgenic mice developed a progressive neurologic phenotype
characterized by neuronal dysfunction in the cerebellum, reduced
anxiety, hyperactivity, impaired performance on the rotarod test, and
lower body weight gain. When mutant ataxin-3 expression was turned off
in symptomatic mice in an early disease state, the transgenic mice were
indistinguishable from negative controls after 5 months of treatment.
Boy et al. (2009) concluded that reducing the production of pathogenic
ataxin-3 may be a promising approach to treat SCA3, provided that such
treatment is applied before irreversible damage has taken place and that
it is continued for a sufficiently long time.

Alves et al. (2010) both overexpressed and silenced wildtype ATX3 in the
rat model of MJD developed by Alves et al. (2008). They found that
overexpression of wildtype ATX3 did not protect against MJD pathology,
that knockdown of wildtype ATX3 did not aggravate MJD pathology, and
that non-allele-specific silencing of ataxin-3 strongly reduced
neuropathology.

- Transgenic Drosophila Models of Machado-Joseph Disease

Warrick et al. (2005) expressed normal and pathogenic forms of human
ATXN3 in Drosophila and found that the normal activity of ATXN3
mitigated polyQ-induced neurodegeneration. When both normal and
pathogenic proteins were expressed together throughout the nervous
system, flies lived longer and showed improved brain cortical structure
compared with flies expressing only the pathogenic protein. Normal ATXN3
reduced accumulation of pathogenic ATXN3 and of other polyQ disease
proteins. Mutations in the ubiquitin interaction motif or in the
ubiquitin protease domain of ATXN3 abrogated the protective effect.
Protection also required proteasome activity, indicating that the normal
function of ATXN3 requires the ubiquitin pathway of protein quality
control.

Jung and Bonini (2007) showed that a transgenic Drosophila model for
spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 recapitulated key features of human CAG
repeat instability, including large repeat changes and strong expansion
bias. Instability was dramatically enhanced by transcription and
modulated by nuclear excision repair and CREB-binding protein (600140),
a histone acetyltransferase whose decreased activity contributes to
polyglutamine disease. Pharmacologic treatment normalized
acetylation-suppressed instability. Thus, Jung and Bonini (2007)
concluded that toxic consequences of pathogenic polyglutamine protein
may include enhancing repeat instability.

Li et al. (2008) provided evidence of a pathogenic role for ATXN3 CAG
repeat RNA in polyQ toxicity. In a screen for modifiers of polyQ
degeneration induced by ATXN3 in a transgenic Drosophila model, the
authors isolated an upregulation allele of muscleblind (see MBNL1;
606516), a gene implicated in the RNA toxicity of CUG expansion
diseases. Upregulation of muscleblind enhanced ATXN3 toxicity. Altering
the ATXN3 repeat sequence to an interrupted CAACAG repeat within the
polyQ-encoding region resulted in dramatically mitigated toxicity in
flies. Expressing an untranslated CAG repeat of pathogenic length in
flies resulted neuronal degeneration. Li et al. (2008) concluded that
these studies reveal a role for RNA in polyQ toxicity, highlighting
common components in RNA-based and polyQ protein-based trinucleotide
repeat expansion diseases.

To gain insight into the significance of ataxin-3 cleavage, Jung et al.
(2009) developed a Drosophila SL2 cell-based model as well as transgenic
fly models of SCA3. Ataxin-3 protein cleavage was conserved in the fly
and may be caspase-dependent as reported previously. Comparison of flies
expressing either wildtype or caspase-site mutant proteins indicated
that ataxin-3 cleavage enhanced neuronal loss in vivo.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MACHADO-JOSEPH DISEASE
PARKINSON DISEASE, LATE-ONSET, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, INCLUDED
ATXN3, (CAG)n EXPANSION

Machado-Joseph disease (109150), also known as spinocerebellar ataxia-3,
results from an expansion of a (CAG)n repeat in the ATXN3 gene. In
normal individuals, the gene contains between 13 and 36 CAG repeats,
whereas most patients with clinically diagnosed MJD and all of the
affected members of a family with clinical and pathologic MJD showed
expansion of the repeat number in the range of 68 to 79 copies
(Kawaguchi et al., 1994).

Susceptibility to Late-Onset Parkinson Disease

In a family of African descent in which 3 members presented with
phenotypic features reminiscent of typical Parkinson disease (168600),
Gwinn-Hardy et al. (2001) identified pathogenic expansions in the ATXN3
gene. Features suggestive of PD included bradykinesis, facial masking,
rigidity, postural instability, shuffling, asymmetric onset, dopamine
responsiveness, and lack of atypical features often associated with
SCA3. A fourth, mildly symptomatic patient also carried the repeat
expansion. The authors suggested that the low numbers of repeats in this
family (67-75; normal, 16-34) presenting with parkinsonism may be
associated with ethnic background and that evaluation for SCA3 should be
considered in similar cases.

;;UBAP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening the expression patterns of ESTs located in a region at
9p22-p21 undergoing loss of heterozygosity in nasopharyngeal carcinoma
(NPC), Yang et al. (1999) identified an EST that is downregulated in
NPC. Using the clone for this EST and 5-prime RACE, Qian et al. (2001)
identified the full-length cDNA sequence, which they designated UBAP1.
The deduced 502-amino acid protein has a predicted molecular mass of 55
kD and contains 2 putative tandem UBA domains at the C terminus, a
coiled-coil domain, 2 possible N-glycosylation sites, 5 PKC
phosphorylation sites, 7 casein kinase II phosphorylation sites, and 3
N-myristoylation sites. Qian et al. (2001) also identified mouse Ubap1.
The human and mouse proteins share 90% sequence identity. Northern blot
analysis of human tissues detected ubiquitous expression of a 2.7-kb
transcript, with highest expression in heart, skeletal muscle, and
liver. RT-PCR of mouse tissues also revealed ubiquitous expression.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using RT-PCR and direct sequencing, Qian et al. (2001) screened the NPC
cell line HNE1 and 10 primary NPCs for mutations in the UBAP1 gene. They
found no sequence alterations.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Qian et al. (2001) mapped the UBAP1 gene to
chromosome 9p22-p21.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Transport of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to the cell surface
membrane is critical for receptor-ligand recognition. However, mammalian
GPCR odorant receptors (ORs), when heterologously expressed in cells,
are poorly expressed on the cell surface. By screening for genes that
induced cell surface expression of ORs expressed in human embryonic
kidney cells, Saito et al. (2004) identified mouse and human REEP1
(609139). They searched databases for homologs of REEP1 and identified
several other REEP genes, including REEP3. In situ hybridization of
mouse olfactory epithelium revealed that, unlike Reep1, Reep3 was not
expressed in olfactory neurons.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the REEP3
gene to chromosome 10 (TMAP RH69842).

613907	TITLE *613907 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 652; ZNF652
;;KIAA0924
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned ZNF652, which they designated
KIAA0924. The deduced protein contains 606 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected moderate ZNF652 expression in all tissues and specific brain
regions examined except spleen, where expression was low.

Using a sequence from CBFA2T3 (603870) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid
screen of a human breast cDNA library, Kumar et al. (2006) cloned
ZNF652. The deduced 606-amino acid protein contains 7 central C2H2-type
zinc finger motifs. RNA dot-blot analysis revealed ubiquitous ZNF652
expression, with highest levels in breast, vulva, prostate, and
pancreas. ZNF652 expression was reduced in a number of cancers compared
with matched normal tissue. Western blot analysis detected ZNF652 at an
apparent molecular mass of 85 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoprecipitation analysis of cotransfected HEK293T cells, Kumar et
al. (2006) confirmed that ZNF652 interacted with CBFA2T3. Deletion
analysis revealed that the C-terminal 109-amino acids of ZNF652 were
required for the interaction, and inclusion of the ZNF652 central zinc
finger domain stabilized the interaction. Reporter gene assays showed
that ZNF652 functioned as a transcriptional repressor. CBFA2T3 enhanced
the repressor activity of ZNF652 in a dose-dependent manner.

Kumar et al. (2008) found that ZNF652 alone or in complex with CBFA2T3
bound the consensus ZNF652 response element (AAGGGTTAA) found in the
promoter region of the HEB (TCF12; 600480) gene. In HEK293T cells, which
express endogenous ZNF652 and CBFA2T3, overexpression of either
repressor downregulated HEB expression, and repression was enhanced by
coexpression of both ZNF652 and CBFA2T3. Mutation analysis revealed that
the NHR3 and NHR4 motifs of CBFA2T3 interacted with the proline-rich
stretch in the C terminus of ZNF652.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1999) mapped the ZNF652
gene to chromosome 17. Kumar et al. (2006) mapped the ZNF652 gene to
chromosome 17q21.32 by database analysis.

;;INTERFERON-INDUCED PROTEIN 17; IFI17;;
LEU13;;
CD225
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In addition to their role in the defense against microbial infections,
interferons (IFNs; see, for example, 147570) exhibit antiproliferative
and differentiating activities that may confer on them potential as
antitumor agents. Exposure to IFNs leads to a modulation in the levels
of many cellular proteins that mediate the pleiotropic effects of
interferons. These effects may be mediated by soluble factors or by
cell-cell interactions involving specific membrane proteins. Deblandre
et al. (1995) identified a 17-kD membrane protein, IFI17, that was
inducible on tumor cell lines by interferon-alpha (147660) and, usually
to a lesser extent, by interferon-gamma (IFNG; 147570). Expression as
detected by FACS analysis or immunoprecipitation was correlated with
sensitivity of the cell lines to growth suppression by interferon. Using
mRNA extracted from HeLa cells incubated with interferon-alpha, the
authors screened a cDNA expression library by panning with a monoclonal
anti-IFI17. They obtained a cDNA sequence encoding a protein that is
identical except for 1 residue to the 125-amino acid protein 9-27 that
Reid et al. (1989) had isolated from a lymphoid cell cosmid library.

By whole-mount in situ hybridization, Lange et al. (2003) found that
expression of mouse fragilis, fragilis-2, and fragilis-3 was restricted
to the epiblast at embryonic days 5.5 and 6.5. By embryonic day 7.5, all
3 transcripts showed variable expression in a cluster of founder
premordial germ cells, and at embryonic days 11.5 and 12.5, all 3
transcripts were detected in gonadal germ cells. The 3 transcripts
showed unique patterns of expression in other tissues during mouse
development.

GENE FUNCTION

Reid et al. (1989) showed that transcription of the IFITM1 gene is
controlled by a 13-bp IFN-stimulated response element in the 5-prime
flanking region of the gene.

To determine precisely how germ cells are specified, Saitou et al.
(2002) performed a genetic screen between single nascent germ cells and
their somatic neighbors that share common ancestry. They demonstrated
that fragilis, a member of the IFN-inducible transmembrane protein
family, marks the onset of germ cell competence, and they proposed that
through homotypic association, it demarcates germ cells from somatic
neighbors. Using single cell gene expression profiles, Saitou et al.
(2002) showed that only those cells with the highest expression of
fragilis subsequently express 'stella' (see 608408), a murine gene that
was detected exclusively in lineage-restricted germ cells. The
stella-positive nascent germ cells exhibited repression of HOXB1
(142968), which may explain their escape from a somatic cell fate and
the retention of pluripotency.

Tanaka et al. (2005) determined that mouse Ifitm1 and Ifitm3 are
expressed on the cell surface of primordial germ cells in a
developmentally-regulated manner and that they appear to modulate cell
adhesion and influence cell differentiation. Ifitm1 activity was
required for primordial germ cell transit, and Ifitm1 acted as a
repulsive molecule, repelling non-Ifitm1-expressing primordial germ
cells from the mesoderm into the endoderm. In contrast, Ifitm3 was
expressed in migratory primordial germ cells and behaved as a homing
signal, enabling the cells to respond to environmental cues that guided
their localization. The guidance activities of Ifitm1 and Ifitm3 were
mediated by their unique N-terminal domains.

GENE STRUCTURE

Reid et al. (1989) found that the IFITM1 gene contains 2 exons.

Perry et al. (1999) found that the promoter of the bovine ISG17 gene was
similar to that of the ISG15 gene (147571) in placement of a tandem
IFN-stimulatory response element (ISRE) at position -90, but unique in
the presence of 3 additional ISREs at positions -123, -332, and -525.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Lange et al. (2003) mapped the IFITM1 gene
to an IFITM gene cluster on chromosome 11p15.5. The order of the genes,
from telomere to centromere, is IFITM5 (614757), IFITM2 (605578),
IFITM1, and IFITM3 (605579), and the cluster spans about 26.5 kb. Lange
et al. (2003) stated that IFITM2 maps to the plus strand and that all
other IFITM genes map to the minus strand. However, Gross (2012)
determined that, in addition to IFITM2, the IFITM1 gene maps to the plus
strand based on an alignment of the IFITM1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK
BC000897) with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

Lange et al. (2003) mapped the mouse Ifitm gene cluster to a region of
chromosome 7F5 that shares homology of synteny with human chromosome
11p15.5. The mouse Ifitm gene cluster contains 5 genes, whereas the
human cluster contains only 4 genes.

EVOLUTION

By phylogenetic analysis, Lange et al. (2003) found that only 2 mouse
fragilis genes, fragilis-4 (Ifitm5) and either fragilis (Ifitm3),
fragilis-2 (Ifitm1), or fragilis-3 (Ifitm2), have been conserved from
mouse to human. They suggested that subsequent gene duplications may
have occurred independently in both species.

605571	TITLE *605571 PIWI-LIKE 1; PIWIL1
;;HIWI;;
MIWI, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; MIWI
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Self-renewing asymmetric division of germline stem cells (GSCs) in
Drosophila is controlled both by an intracellular mechanism and by
cell-cell interactions. Cox et al. (1998) cloned and characterized the
Drosophila piwi gene and showed that it is essential for GSC maintenance
in both males and females. Mutation in piwi causes differentiation of
GSCs without self-renewing divisions immediately following the
initiation of oogenesis. The piwi protein is highly basic, especially in
the C-terminal 100 amino acid residues, and is well conserved in
evolution. Cox et al. (1998) cloned 2 piwi-like genes in C. elegans that
are required for GSC renewal and also found sequence similarity with 2
Arabidopsis thaliana proteins required for meristem cell division. By
use of an EST with sequence similarity to the Drosophila piwi gene to
screen a human testis cDNA library, they cloned the human homolog,
PIWIL1. The deduced PIWIL1 protein shares 47.1% overall sequence
identity, and 58.7% identity within the C terminus, with the Drosophila
protein. Cox et al. (1998) found no piwi-related genes in the bacteria
and yeast genomes, suggesting that piwi has a stem cell-related function
only in multicellular organisms. Piwi and piwi-related proteins differ
in the N terminus but show high homology in the C terminus where they
all contain a conserved 43-amino acid domain, which the authors
designated the PIWI box. Cox et al. (1998) suggested that piwi-related
genes represent a novel class of genes required for GSC division in
diverse multicellular organisms.

By PCR of CD34 (142230)-positive hematopoietic cells, followed by
5-prime RACE of a testis cDNA library, Sharma et al. (2001) cloned
PIWIL1, which they called HIWI. PCR analysis of adult and fetal tissues
detected highest HIWI expression in adult testis, followed by adult and
fetal kidney. Weaker expression was detected in all other fetal tissues
examined and in adult prostate, ovary, small intestine, heart, brain,
liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas. Semiquantitative RT-PCR
revealed HIWI expression in CD34-positive hematopoietic cells, and HIWI
expression diminished during differentiation. HIWI was not expressed in
C34-negative cells.

By 5-prime RACE of testis mRNA, Qiao et al. (2002) obtained a
full-length HIWI cDNA. The deduced 861-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 98.5 kD and contains a central PAZ motif
and a C-terminal PIWI motif. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.6-kb
HIWI transcript in testis only. RT-PCR detected low HIWI expression in
testis from a 7-year-old boy. In situ hybridization and
immunofluorescence labeling of adult testis revealed HIWI mRNA and
protein only in a subset of spermatogenic cells in transverse sections
of tubules. HIWI was not detected in basal germ cells of seminiferous
epithelium or in Sertoli cells. Expression of HIWI appeared to be
limited to specific stages of the seminiferous epithelial cycle.
Northern blot analysis showed upregulated HIWI expression in 12 of 19
seminomas. In contrast, HIWI expression was not increased in 10
nonseminomas and 4 spermatocyte seminomas.

Deng and Lin (2002) cloned a mouse Piwil1 cDNA, which they called Miwi.
Northern blot analysis revealed a major and a minor Miwi transcript in
adult testis, but not in any other adult or embryonic tissues examined.
In adult testis, Miwi RNA was detected in a small number of germ cells
at the basal layer of the seminiferous tubule, presumably in zygotene
stage spermatocytes, and expression was abundant in primary
spermatocytes. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed Miwi in pachytene
stage spermatocytes, and expression increased until the early round
spermatid stage, after which its abundance decreased. Western blot
analysis detected Miwi at an apparent molecular mass of 100 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Sharma et al. (2001) found that transient expression of HIWI in a human
leukemia cell line resulted in a dramatic reduction in cellular
proliferation. Overexpression of HIWI led to programmed cell death.

Deng and Lin (2002) found that mouse Miwi complexed with mRNAs of Act
(605126) and Crem (123812) target genes.

Girard et al. (2006) showed that mouse Miwi bound a novel class of
approximately 29- to 30-nucleotide RNAs that were highly abundant in
testis. They named these RNAs 'Piwi-interacting RNAs,' or piRNAs, and
identified 52,934 candidate piRNAs. The distribution of piRNAs among
chromosomes did not correlate either with gene density or repeat
density. Nearly 84% of piRNAs mapped uniquely in the genome, and 17%
mapped to repeats, including SINES, LINES, and LTR retrotransposons.
piRNAs were predominantly grouped into 20- to 90-kb clusters, with long
stretches of small RNAs derived from only 1 strand. Similar piRNAs were
identified in human and rat, with major clusters occurring in syntenic
locations. Girard et al. (2006) proposed that the abundance of piRNAs in
germline cells and the male sterility of Miwi mutants suggests a role
for piRNAs in gametogenesis.

Grivna et al. (2006) found that Miwi associated with both piRNAs and
mRNAs in cytosolic ribonucleoprotein and polysome fractions of mouse
testicular extract. As polysomes increased in early spermiogenesis, Miwi
levels increased in polysome fractions. Moreover, Miwi associated with
the mRNA cap-binding complex. Examination of Miwi -/- testis revealed
that Miwi was required for expression of piRNAs and testis-associated
miRNAs. Immunoprecipitation of Miwi from mouse testicular extracts
coprecipitated Dicer (606241), but Miwi was not required for Dicer
expression or stability. Grivna et al. (2006) concluded that Miwi has a
role in small RNA-mediated processes during spermatogenesis.

Canalization, or developmental robustness, is an organism's ability to
produce the same phenotype despite genotypic variations and
environmental influences. Expression of a gain-of-function allele of
Drosophila Kruppel results in misregulation of genes in the fly eye disc
and generation of eye outgrowths, which are normally repressed via
canalization. Using a fly eye outgrowth assay, Gangaraju et al. (2011)
showed that a protein complex made up of Piwi, Hsp83 (HSP90; see
140571), and Hop (STIP1; 605063) was involved in canalization. The
results suggested that canalization may involve Hsp83-mediated
phosphorylation of Piwi. Gangaraju et al. (2011) concluded that the eye
outgrowth phenotype is a defect in epigenetic silencing of a normally
suppressed genotype.

Reuter et al. (2011) showed that Miwi is a small RNA-guided RNase
(slicer) that requires extensive complementarity for target cleavage in
vitro. Disruption of its catalytic activity in mice by a single point
mutation caused male infertility, and mutant germ cells showed increased
accumulation of LINE-1 retrotransposon transcripts. Reuter et al. (2011)
provided evidence for Miwi slicer activity directly cleaving transposon
mRNAs, offering an explanation for the continued maintenance of
repeat-derived piRNAs long after transposon silencing is established in
germline stem cells. Furthermore, Reuter et al. (2011) concluded that
their study supported a slicer-dependent silencing mechanism that
functions without piRNA amplification. Thus, Piwi proteins seem to act
in a 2-pronged mammalian transposon silencing strategy: one promotes
transcriptional repression in the embryo, the other reinforces silencing
at the posttranscriptional level after birth.

GENE STRUCTURE

Deng and Lin (2002) determined that the mouse Piwil1 gene contains 22
exons and spans 19.2 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis and FISH, Sharma et al. (2001) mapped the
PIWIL1 gene to chromosome 12q24.2-q24.32. Qiao et al. (2002) mapped the
PIWIL1 gene to chromosome 12q24.33 by radiation hybrid analysis and
FISH. By genomic sequence analysis, Sasaki et al. (2003) mapped the
PIWIL1 gene to chromosome 12q23.

Deng and Lin (2002) mapped the mouse Piwil1 gene to a region of
chromosome 5 that shows homology of synteny to human chromosome 12.

ANIMAL MODEL

Deng and Lin (2002) found that Miwi-null mice were born at the expected
mendelian ratio and developed normally. Mutant males were sterile,
whereas mutant females were fertile. No sperm was found in the
epididymis of Miwi-null males, and spermatogenesis was uniformly
arrested at the round spermatid stage following the first wave of
spermatogenesis. Miwi-null testis showed increased numbers of apoptotic
cells from the basal layer to the luminal layer of the seminiferous
epithelium, suggesting that survival of spermatocytes, spermatids, and
possibly spermatogonia was compromised. Expression of Crem and Trf2
(TERF2; 602027) target genes was reduced in Miwi-null testis.

604260	TITLE *604260 SIGNAL TRANSDUCER AND ACTIVATOR OF TRANSCRIPTION 5B; STAT5B
STAT5B/RARA FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

STAT5A (601511) and STAT5B are activated in response to a variety of
cytokines (Wang et al., 1996).

CLONING

Ambrosio et al. (2002) cloned the human STAT5B gene. They identified 2
alternatively spliced STAT5B transcripts that differ only in their
noncoding promoter sequences. The deduced 787-amino acid STAT5B protein
has an N-terminal DNA-binding domain, followed by a 4-helix bundle, a
DNA-binding specificity domain, a connector region, an SH2 domain, and a
C-terminal transactivation domain. RT-PCR detected the STAT5B transcript
containing promoter I in all tissues and cell lines examined.
Transcripts containing promoter II were highly expressed in placenta and
could be detected at weaker levels in spleen, brain, and heart, as well
as in some cell lines.

Wang et al. (1996) demonstrated that carboxy-truncated variant Stat5a
and Stat5b proteins of 77 and 80 kD, respectively, naturally occur in
mouse. These truncated Stat5a and Stat5b forms are derived from
incompletely spliced Stat5a and Stat5b transcripts.

By Northern blot analysis, Miyoshi et al. (2001) found that mouse Stat5b
is expressed from 2 promoters. Expression from the distal promoter was
ubiquitous, whereas expression from the proximal promoter was restricted
to liver, muscle, and mammary tissue.

GENE FUNCTION

Wang et al. (1996) showed that the truncated mouse Stat5a and Stat5b
proteins are inducibly tyrosine phosphorylated in the response to
several cytokines. These truncated Stat5 proteins form heterodimers with
both the full-length wildtype Stat5a and Stat5b proteins. Wang et al.
(1996) demonstrated that recombinant truncated forms of Stat5a and
Stat5b can be tyrosine phosphorylated and can bind to DNA. The tyrosine
phosphorylation of the carboxy-truncated forms was considerably more
stable than that of the wildtype Stat5a and Stat5b proteins.
Overexpression of a carboxy-truncated Stat5a protein in cells resulted
in the specific inhibition of the IL3 (147740)-induced transcriptional
activation of the oncostatin M gene (OSM; 165095) and the
cytokine-inducible SH2 domain-encoding gene (Cis), both of which have
been shown to be normally regulated by Stat5a. Although the truncated
Stat5a protein dominantly suppressed the induction of these genes, no
effects on cell proliferation were observed. Wang et al. (1996) stated
that their results demonstrate the natural existence of potential
dominantly suppressive variants of Stat5a and Stat5b, and implicate the
carboxyl domains of Stat5a and Stat5b proteins in transcriptional
regulation and functions related to dephosphorylation.

Boucheron et al. (1998) examined the DNA-binding domains of mouse Stat5a
and Stat5b and determined that the difference in their DNA-binding
specificities depends on a critical glycine residue in Stat5b and a
critical glutamic residue at a similar position in Stat5a.

Mak et al. (2002) studied the role of STAT5 as a component of the
differentiation of endometrium in response to ovarian hormone
stimulation in vivo. The abundance and subcellular distribution of STAT5
in endometrial stromal cells after a decidualization stimulus of cAMP
plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) had been investigated in vitro.
Western blot analysis revealed an increase in the apparent abundance of
STAT5A and STAT5B in the cytosolic and nuclear fractions at 2, 3, and 4
days after stimulation. The potential functional relevance of this
increase in STAT5 was suggested by the ability of transiently
transfected STAT5A or STAT5B to significantly enhance the response of
the decidual PRL (176760) promoter to cAMP/MPA acetate and attenuation
of the response to cAMP/MPA by dominant-negative STAT5. Mak et al.
(2002) concluded that regulated expression of STAT5 is therefore a
component of decidual differentiation of human endometrial stromal cells
and contributes significantly to activation of the decidual PRL
promoter. Alteration of this process by an antiphospholipid antibody
component suggested decidual differentiation as a potential clinical
target in recurrent early miscarriages.

In the Drosophila male germline, local activation of the Janus
kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (Jak-STAT)
pathway maintains stem cells; germline stem cells lacking Jak-STAT
signaling differentiate into spermatogonia without self-renewal. By
conditionally manipulating Jak-STAT signaling using a
temperature-sensitive allele of Stat92e, the Drosophila homolog of
STAT5B, Brawley and Matunis (2004) demonstrated that spermatogonia that
have initiated differentiation and are undergoing limited mitotic
(transit-amplifying) divisions can repopulate the niche and revert to
stem cell identity. Thus, Brawley and Matunis (2004) have shown that in
the appropriate microenvironment, transit-amplifying cells
dedifferentiate, becoming functional stem cells during tissue
regeneration.

Wawersik et al. (2005) showed that the JAK/STAT pathway provides a
sex-specific signal from the soma to the germline in Drosophila
embryonic gonads. The somatic gonad expresses a JAK/STAT ligand,
'unpaired' (upd), in a male-specific manner, and activates the JAK/STAT
pathway in male germ cells at the time of gonad formation. Furthermore,
the JAK/STAT pathway is necessary for male-specific germ cell behavior
during early gonad development, and is sufficient to activate aspects of
male germ cell behavior in female germ cells. Wawersik et al. (2005)
found that Drosophila Stat92e was upregulated specifically in male, but
not female, germ cells at the time of gonad formation. This reflects
male-specific activation of the JAK/STAT pathway because the activated
form of Stat92e (phosphorylated Stat92e) was also detected only in male
germ cells, and JAK activity was necessary and sufficient for Stat92e
expression. Wawersik et al. (2005) concluded that their findings
provided direct evidence that the JAK/STAT pathway mediates a key signal
from the somatic gonad that regulates male germline sexual development.

Vignudelli et al. (2010) found that overexpression of ZFP36L1 (601064)
in human CD34 (142230)-positive cord blood-derived stem/progenitor cells
inhibited their erythroid differentiation and colony formation, which
appeared to be due to downregulation of STAT5B protein levels through
degradation of STAT5B mRNA. Overexpression of ZFP36 (190700) also
inhibited erythroid differentiation, and overexpression of both ZFP36
and ZFP36L1 had a cumulative effect. Both ZFP36 and ZFP36L1 directly
bound a canonical AU-rich element II in the 3-prime UTR of STAT5B mRNA.
Vignudelli et al. (2010) concluded that ZFP36L1 negatively regulates
erythroid differentiation by interfering with the STAT5B pathway in
human hematopoietic stem cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ambrosio et al. (2002) determined that the STAT5B gene contains 19
exons. It has 2 alternate first exons, 1a and 1b, which are separated by
about 1.3 kb. A CpG island covers exon 1a and extends into the 5-prime
flanking region. Exon 2 contains the ATG start codon.

Miyoshi et al. (2001) determined that the mouse Stat5b gene contains 20
exons and spans more than 50 kb. The translation initiation codon is in
exon 2, and the stop codon is in exon 19. Stat5b has 2 promoters
separated by more than 20 kb.

Crispi et al. (2004) determined that both the STAT5A and STAT5B genes
lack TATA and CAAT elements, but both have binding sites for
transcription factors common in TATA-less promoters. Using a reporter
assay, they determined that gene fragments containing the CpG islands
were the most transcriptionally active fragments. Sp1 (189906) enhanced
expression of the basal promoters, and DNA methylation interfered with
Sp1-induced transcription. Cross-species sequence comparison identified
a bidirectional negative cis-acting regulatory element in the STAT5
intergenic region.

MAPPING

By FISH, Lin et al. (1996) mapped the STAT5A (601511) and STAT5B genes
to 17q11.2. In their FISH analysis, Arnould et al. (1999) found that the
STAT5B and RARA genes are very close to each other in 17q21.1-q21.2.
Ambrosio et al. (2002) determined that the STAT5A and STAT5B genes are
in an inverted orientation, with their 5-prime ends about 11 kb apart.

Miyoshi et al. (2001) mapped the mouse Stat5b gene to chromosome 11. The
promoters of the Stat5a and Stat5b genes are located head to head and
are separated by 10 kb. The order and orientation of genes at this
locus, Ptrf (603189)--Stat3 (102582)--Stat5a--Stat5b--Lgp1
(608587)--Hcrt (602358), are identical in the syntenic region of human
chromosome 17q21.

CYTOGENETICS

Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) exhibits a characteristic t(15;17)
translocation that fuses the promyelocytic leukemia gene (PML; 102578)
on 15q22 to the retinoic acid receptor-alpha gene (RARA; 180240) on
17q12-q21.1. In a small subset of acute promyelocytic-like leukemias
(APLL), RARA is fused to a different partner: the promyelocytic leukemia
zinc finger gene (PLZF; 176797) on 11q23, the nucleophosmin gene (NPM1;
164040) on 5q35, or the nuclear mitotic apparatus-1 gene (NUMA1; 164009)
on 11q13. Arnould et al. (1999) reported the molecular characterization
of a RARA gene rearrangement in a patient with APLL and demonstrated
that the partner fused to RARA was the STAT5B gene, which belongs to the
Janus kinase (JAK)/STAT signaling pathway. Remarkably, the STAT5B
component of the chimeric protein was delocalized from the cytoplasm to
the nucleus, where it displayed a microspeckled pattern. Therefore,
unusual features of this APLL might result from dysregulation of the
JAK/STAT5 signal transducing pathways in the leukemic cells of the
patient. This was the first example of a human tumor bearing a
structurally abnormal STAT gene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Kofoed et al. (2003) noted that signal transduction involving the growth
hormone receptor (GHR; 600946) occurs by means of at least 3
well-established pathways: STAT, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (see
PIK3R1, 171833), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (see MAPK1,
176948) pathways. Collectively, these pathways mediate the
growth-promoting and metabolic actions of growth hormone (GH; 139250).
Kofoed et al. (2003) described a patient with the clinical and
biochemical characteristics of growth hormone insensitivity (245590), a
normal GHR gene, and a homozygous ala630-to-pro mutation (A630P;
604260.0001) in the STATB gene. The patient had a combined phenotype of
GH insensitivity and immunodeficiency consistent with the presence of a
defect in the JAK/STAT system.

Cohen et al. (2006) studied the patient originally reported by Kofoed et
al. (2003) and observed immune dysregulation with decreased numbers of
regulatory CD4+ (186940)/CD25 (IL2RA; 147730)-high T cells (Tregs). The
patient's Tregs showed low expression of FOXP3 (300292) and were
impaired in their ability to suppress proliferation of or to kill
CD4+/CD25- cells. CD25 expression was also reduced after IL2 (147680)
stimulation, although IL2-mediated upregulation of IL2RG (308380),
perforin (PRF1; 170280), and CD154 (CD40LG; 300386) was normal. The
immunologic phenotype of the patient's heterozygous parents tended to be
normal or intermediate.

In a 16.4-year-old Turkish girl with postnatal growth retardation and
insensitivity to growth hormone, who also had recurrent pulmonary
infections and a bleeding diathesis due to defective thrombocyte
aggregation, Hwa et al. (2005) identified homozygosity for a 1-bp
insertion in the STAT5B gene (604260.0002).

In a 30-year-old man born in the Dutch Antilles who had short stature
and delayed puberty with normal GH and GHBP levels, an elevated plasma
prolactin (176760) level, and extremely low levels of IGF1, IGFBP3
(146732), and acid-labile subunit (ALS; 601489), Vidarsdottir et al.
(2006) identified homozygosity for a 1-bp insertion in the STAT5B gene
(604260.0003). The authors stated that the patient was diagnosed with
congenital ichthyosis at birth (see 242300) and had hemorrhagic
varicella at 16 years of age, but had no history of pulmonary or
immunologic problems.

In a 16-year-old girl with severe postnatal growth failure, GH
insensitivity, and immunodeficiency, Bernasconi et al. (2006) identified
homozygosity for a nonsense mutation in the STAT5B gene (604260.0004).
Immunologic analysis revealed a moderate T-cell lymphopenia, normal
CD4/CD8 ratio, and very low numbers of natural killer and gamma-delta
(see 186970) T cells, and the T cells had a chronically hyperactivated
phenotype. In vitro T-cell proliferation and interleukin-2 (147680)
signaling were impaired, and CD4+/CD25+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) were
significantly diminished. Bernasconi et al. (2006) concluded that STAT5B
is a key protein for T-cell function in humans.

In 2 Kuwaiti sisters with severe postnatal growth retardation, normal GH
and GHBP levels, and no mutation in the GH receptor gene, Hwa et al.
(2007) identified homozygosity for a 1-bp deletion in the STAT5B gene
(604260.0005). The 3.9-year-old sister had recently been diagnosed with
bronchiectasis and interstitial pneumonitis, and her 2-year-old sister
had been diagnosed with idiopathic juvenile arthritis.

ANIMAL MODEL

STAT5 is activated in a broad spectrum of human hematologic
malignancies. Using a genetic approach, Schwaller et al. (2000)
addressed whether activation of STAT5 is necessary for the myelo- and
lymphoproliferative disease induced by the TEL (600618)/JAK2 (147796)
fusion gene. Whereas mice transplanted with bone marrow transduced with
retrovirus expressing TEL/JAK2 developed a rapidly fatal myelo- and
lymphoproliferative syndrome, reconstitution with bone marrow derived
from Stat5a/b-deficient mice expressing TEL/JAK2 did not induce disease.
Disease induction in the Stat5a/b-deficient background was rescued with
a bicistronic retrovirus encoding TEL/JAK2 and Stat5a. Furthermore,
myeloproliferative disease was induced by reconstitution with bone
marrow cells expressing a constitutively active mutant, Stat5a, or a
single Stat5a target, murine Osm. These data defined a critical role for
STAT5A/B and OSM in the pathogenesis of TEL/JAK2 disease.

Snow et al. (2003) observed that a subset of mice deficient in both
Stat5a and Stat5b had dramatic alterations in several bone marrow
progenitor populations, along with cellular infiltration of colon,
liver, and kidney and early death. The pathology and increased mortality
in these mice were abrogated when Rag1 (179615) was also deleted. The
phenotype was similar to that in mice defective in Il2 (147680)
signaling and correlated with a reduction in the number of Cd4
(186940)-positive/Cd25 (IL2RA; 147730)-positive regulatory T cells. Snow
et al. (2003) concluded that STAT5 is critical for maintenance of
tolerance in vivo and that STAT5 is probably activated by IL2R.

Cui et al. (2004) conditionally deleted the 110-kb Stat5 locus, which
spans both the Stat5a and Stat5b genes, to study the functions of the
Stat5 genes during mouse mammary gland development. Loss of the Stat5
genes prior to pregnancy prevented epithelial proliferation and
differentiation. Deletion of Stat5 during pregnancy, after mammary
epithelium had entered Stat5-mediated differentiation, resulted in
premature cell death, indicating that mammary epithelial cell
proliferation, differentiation, and survival require Stat5.

Yao et al. (2006) compared mice with a complete deletion of Stat5a and
Stat5b (Stat5 -/-) with mice having an N-terminally truncated, partially
functional Stat5 protein (Stat5delN) and mice lacking Il7r (146661),
Jak3 (600173), or the common gamma chain, Il2rg (308380). Stat5 -/- mice
died before or shortly after birth. Examination of day-18.5 Stat5 -/-
embryos showed a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID; see 601457)
phenotype with significantly fewer thymocytes and splenocytes than
wildtype controls. The thymocyte deficit in Stat5 -/- embryos was
similar in magnitude to that in Il7r- or Il2rg-deficient embryos,
whereas Stat5delN embryos had significantly more thymocytes. The
splenocyte reduction in Stat5 -/- embryos was more severe than that in
Il7r- or IL2rg-deficient mice. B-cell proportions were particularly low
in Stat5 -/- embryos compared with controls, similar to Il7r -/- mice.
Tcra (see 186880) and Tcrb (see 186930) rearrangement was normal in
Stat5 -/- mice, but Tcrg (see 186970) rearrangement was defective. As in
Jak3 -/- mice, there was a marked reduction in CD8-positive T cells. Yao
et al. (2006) concluded that STAT5 deficiency results in SCID, similar
in many respects to what occurs in IL7R, JAK3, or IL2RG deficiency.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
GROWTH HORMONE INSENSITIVITY WITH IMMUNODEFICIENCY
STAT5B, ALA630PRO

In a 16.5-year-old Argentinian girl with short stature and growth
hormone insensitivity (245590), Kofoed et al. (2003) identified
homozygosity for a G-to-C transversion in exon 15 of the STAT5B gene,
result in an ala630-to-pro (A630P) substitution. Both parents were
heterozygous for the mutation; there was no family history of growth
failure, and the girl's younger sisters were of normal stature. The
patient also had recurrent pulmonary infections; biopsy revealed
lymphoid interstitial pneumonia and Pneumocystis carinii was isolated
from the tissue. Kofoed et al. (2003) concluded that the combined
phenotype of growth hormone insensitivity and immunodeficiency was
consistent with the presence of a defect in the JAK/STAT signaling
system.

Fang et al. (2006) studied the molecular mechanisms underlying the
growth hormone (GH; 139250) insensitivity and IGF1 (147440) deficiency
caused by A630P-mutated STAT5B. The A630P mutation disrupts the SRC
homology 2 (SH2) architecture such that mutant STAT5B most likely cannot
dock to phosphotyrosines on ligand-activated receptors, and stable
interactions with DNA are prevented. Fang et al. (2006) concluded that
because A630P-mutant STAT5B is an inefficient signal transducer and
transcription factor, the detrimental impact on signaling pathways
important for normal growth and immunity explains, in part, the complex
clinical phenotype of GH insensitivity and immune dysfunction.

.0002
GROWTH HORMONE INSENSITIVITY WITH IMMUNODEFICIENCY
STAT5B, 1-BP INS, 1191G

In a 16.4-year-old Turkish girl with postnatal growth retardation and
insensitivity to growth hormone (245590), born of second-cousin parents,
Hwa et al. (2005) identified homozygosity for a 1-bp insertion
(1191insG) in exon 10 of the STAT5B gene, resulting in an asp398-to-glu
(N398E) substitution and predicted to cause a stop codon 15 amino acids
downstream with loss of the C terminus. The mutation was not found in 50
controls. The patient also had recurrent pulmonary infections and a
bleeding diathesis due to defective thrombocyte aggregation.

.0003
GROWTH HORMONE INSENSITIVITY WITH IMMUNODEFICIENCY
STAT5B, 1-BP INS, 1102C

In a 30-year-old man, born in the Dutch Antilles of nonconsanguineous
parents, who had short stature and delayed puberty with growth hormone
insensitivity (245590), Vidarsdottir et al. (2006) identified
homozygosity for a 1-bp insertion (1102insC) in the STAT5b gene, causing
a frameshift predicted to result in a truncated protein lacking most of
the DNA-binding domain and the SH2 domain. The patient's parents,
brother, and sister were all heterozygous carriers of the mutation. The
authors stated that the patient was diagnosed with congenital ichthyosis
at birth (see 242300) and had hemorrhagic varicella at 16 years of age,
but had no history of pulmonary or immunologic problems.

.0004
GROWTH HORMONE INSENSITIVITY WITH IMMUNODEFICIENCY
STAT5B, ARG152TER

In a 16-year-old girl with severe postnatal growth failure, growth
hormone insensitivity, and immunodeficiency (245590), Bernasconi et al.
(2006) identified homozygosity for a C-T transition in exon 5 of the
STAT5B gene, resulting in an arg152-to-ter (R152X) substitution
predicted to cause complete absence of protein expression. The patient's
parents and brother were heterozygous for the mutation.

.0005
GROWTH HORMONE INSENSITIVITY WITH IMMUNODEFICIENCY
STAT5B, 1-BP DEL, EXON 13/INTRON 13 JUNCTION

In 2 Kuwaiti sisters, born of consanguineous parents, who had severe
postnatal growth retardation but normal growth hormone (139250) and
growth hormone-binding protein (see 600946) levels, Hwa et al. (2007)
identified homozygosity for the deletion of a single G at the exon
13/intron 13 junction of the STAT5B gene, predicted to cause a
frameshift and alternative splicing. The parents, who were of normal
stature, were heterozygous for the mutation. The older sister, aged 3.9
years, had recently been diagnosed with bronchiectasis and interstitial
pneumonitis, and her 2-year-old sister had been diagnosed with
idiopathic juvenile arthritis.

176945	TITLE *176945 EPHRIN RECEPTOR EphA8; EPHA8
;;EPH- AND ELK-RELATED KINASE; EEK;;
PROTEIN TYROSINE KINASE EEK;;
HEK3
DESCRIPTION See EPH (EPHA1; 179610) for background on Eph receptors and their
ligands, the ephrins. Chan and Watt (1991) identified human and rat DNAs
encoding 2 novel members of the EPH subclass of putative receptor
protein-tyrosine kinases. Rat cDNA clones encoding EEK (EPH- and
ELK-related kinase) were isolated from a brain cDNA library probed with
DNA encoding the kinase region of the insulin receptor-related receptor
(INSRR; 147671). The EEK protein was predicted to contain all the amino
acid residues conserved in the catalytic domains of protein-tyrosine
kinases and was most similar to 2 putative receptor protein-tyrosine
kinases of the EPH subclass, ELK (EPHB1; 600600) and EPH, showing 69 and
57% identity, respectively. Human genomic DNAs, encoding part of EEK as
well as another putative protein tyrosine kinase most similar to ELK
(90%) and symbolized ERK (EPHB2; 600997) for ELK-related kinase, were
isolated and partially characterized. The novel identity of these 2
EPH-family genes was further supported by Southern blot analysis and
localization to human chromosome 1. In Northern blot analysis of rat
RNA, DNAs encoding rat EEK and human ERK hybridized to transcripts most
abundant in brain and lung, respectively. These 2 new members of the EPH
subclass of receptor protein-tyrosine kinases, EEK and ERK, may
therefore have tissue-specific functions distinct from those of the
other EPH family members.

ANIMAL MODEL

Park et al. (1997) generated mice homozygous for a mutation that
disrupts the gene encoding EPHA8, a member of the Eph family of tyrosine
proteinase receptors. EphA8 -/- mice developed to term, were fertile,
and did not display obvious anatomical or physiologic defects. The mouse
EphA8 gene is expressed primarily in a rostral to caudal gradient in the
developing tectum. Axonal tracing experiments revealed that in these
mutant mice, axons from a subpopulation of tectal neurons located in the
superficial layers of the superior colliculus did not reach targets
located in the contralateral inferior colliculus. Moreover, EphA8-null
animals displayed an aberrant ipsilateral axonal tract that projected to
the ventral region of the cervical spinal cord. Retrograde labeling
revealed that these abnormal projections originated from a small
subpopulation of superior colliculus neurons that normally express the
EPHA8 gene. Park et al. (1997) suggested that EPHA8 receptors play a
role in axonal pathfinding during development of the mammalian nervous
system.

603420	TITLE *603420 CALUMENIN; CALU
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Many calcium-binding proteins are reported to be localized in the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and involved in such ER functions as protein
folding and sorting. Among these are RCN1 (602735), RCN2 (602584), and
calumenin (CALU), which form a novel family of calcium-binding proteins
in the ER and Golgi apparatus. By searching sequence databases with a
mouse Calu cDNA sequence (Yabe et al., 1997), Yabe et al. (1998)
identified a human CALU EST, which they used to clone a full-length CALU
cDNA. The cDNA encodes a deduced 315-amino acid protein containing 6
EF-hand motifs, 1 potential N-glycosylation site, and a C-terminal ER
retention signal. The human and mouse CALU proteins are 98% identical.
Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the 3.4-kb CALU mRNA is
ubiquitously expressed in human tissues. Southern blot analysis using a
human CALU cDNA probe detected bands in a variety of species.

MAPPING

Yabe et al. (1997) mapped the mouse Calu gene to the proximal portion of
chromosome 7. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Yabe et al. (1998)
localized the human CALU gene to 7q32, which was an unexpected result
due to the homology of synteny between proximal mouse chromosome 7 and
human 19q13.2-q13.3.

615295	TITLE *615295 UBIQUITIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE 34; USP34
;;KIAA0570
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ubiquitin (191339)-specific proteases, like USP34, remove ubiquitin
modifications from ubiquitinated proteins and thereby rescue these
proteins from proteasomal degradation (Lui et al., 2011).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) obtained a partial USP34 clone, which they
designated KIAA0570. RT-PCR detected variable USP34 expression in all
tissues examined.

Lui et al. (2011) stated that full-length USP34 contains 3,546 amino
acids and possesses a central ubiquitin hydrolase domain characteristic
of deubiquitinating enzymes.

GENE FUNCTION

AXIN1 (603816) functions within a 'destruction complex' to inhibit
signaling through the Wnt (see 164820)-beta-catenin (CTNNB1; 116806)
pathway, which modulates multiple cellular processes during embryonic
development and adult tissue homeostasis. Lui et al. (2011) found that
USP34 interacted directly with ubiquitinated AXIN1 in AXIN1-containing
complexes in human cell lines. USP34 conferred deubiquitinating activity
to AXIN1 complexes and promoted AXIN1 nuclear accumulation. Knockdown of
USP34 reduced AXIN1 content and beta-catenin signaling, and AXIN1 levels
could be rescued by inhibition of the proteasome. In vitro, the isolated
recombinant USP34 hydrolytic core region exhibited robust ubiquitin
isopeptidase activity that required the catalytic residue cys1903. Lui
et al. (2011) concluded that nuclear AXIN1 has a positive regulatory
role in Wnt-beta-catenin signaling that is controlled by USP34.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the USP34 gene
to chromosome 2.

Hartz (2013) mapped the USP34 gene to chromosome 2p15 based on an
alignment of the USP34 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB011142) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

614206	TITLE *614206 CHROMATIN TARGET OF PRMT1; CHTOP
;;CHROMOSOME 1 OPEN READING FRAME 77; C1OORF77;;
SMALL PROTEIN RICH IN ARGININE AND GLYCINE; SRAG;;
FRIEND OF PRMT1; FOP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By PCR of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Zullo et al. (2009) cloned 3 splice
variants of CHTOP, which they called SRAG, SRAG3, and SRAG5. SRAG
encodes the full-length 248-amino acid protein, which contains a central
arginine- and glycine-rich domain similar to that found in nucleolin
(NCL; 164035) and fibrillarin (FBL; 134795). Compared with the
full-length SRAG protein, SRAG3 contains an N-terminal deletion, and
SRAG5 encodes a protein with a partial deletion within the arginine- and
glycine-rich domain. Western blot analysis of mouse tissues revealed
widespread Srag expression, with highest levels in thymus, spleen, and
lymph node. Srag3 was expressed in lung only, and Srag5 was expressed in
stomach only. Endogenous HEK293 cell SRAG protein migrated as a doublet
with an apparent molecular mass of about 28 kD. Cell fractionation and
extraction experiments revealed that SRAG was predominantly a nuclear
protein, with some nucleolar localization. SRAG5, but not SRAG3, was
also detected in nucleoli. However, immunofluorescence microscopy of
transfected HeLa cells revealed that fluorescence-tagged SRAG and SRAG5
were nucleolar in 25 to 35% of cells, whereas SRAG3 was nucleolar in
nearly 100% of cells. Database analysis revealed SRAG orthologs in
vertebrates, but not invertebrates.

Van Dijk et al. (2010) cloned mouse Chtop, which they designated Fop,
and by database analysis, they identified full-length human FOP. The
mouse and human FOP proteins both contain 249 amino acids. A second FOP
isoform may be translated from a conserved internal methionine at
residue 26. Full-length FOP has a central glycine- and arginine-rich
(GAR) domain and 2 copies of a 9-amino acid sequence near the C
terminus. Immunohistochemical analysis of mouse erythroleukemia (MEL)
cells revealed a punctate nuclear distribution. In day-16.5 mouse
embryos, Fop protein was expressed in heart, lung, gut, kidney,
submandibular gland, thymus, follicles of the vibrissae, muscle, brown
fat, and neuronal cells of brain, olfactory epithelium, and dorsal root
ganglia. Fop tightly associated with facultative heterochromatin in MEL
cells. Time-lapse imaging showed that fluorescence-tagged Fop released
from condensed chromosomes during mitosis and relocalized to chromatin
after cell division.

GENE FUNCTION

Using mutation analysis, Zullo et al. (2009) showed that the N-terminal
40 amino acids of full-length SRAG functioned as a nucleolar exclusion
signal. Treatment with an RNase or disruption of nucleolar ribosomal RNA
reduced nucleolar SRAG localization, suggesting that nucleolar SRAG
depends upon RNA. Srag protein expression was reduced following
activation of mouse thymocytes and during the G2/M phase of the cell
cycle in HeLa cells. Overexpression of SRAG in HeLa cells slowed cell
growth by reducing entry into the G2/M phase and by enhancing cell
death.

Using fetal mouse liver cells expressing the entire human beta-globin
cluster (see HBB; 141900), van Dijk et al. (2010) found that knockdown
of Fop via lentivirus infection upregulated the expression of human
fetal gamma-globin (see HBG1; 142200) within the beta-globin cluster, in
addition to upregulating expression of the embryonic mouse beta-globin
genes, epsilon-Y and beta-H1. Silencing of Fop did not alter expression
of the adult mouse globin genes beta-major and alpha-globin (see HBA1;
141800). Depletion of FOP from adult human erythroid progenitor cells
increased expression of embryonic epsilon-globin (HBE1; 142100) and
gamma-globin and decreased expression of adult beta-globin mRNA. The
embryonic zeta-globin gene (HBZ; 142310) within the alpha-globin cluster
was also reactivated following FOP depletion. FOP appeared to modulate
SOX6 (607257)-dependent silencing of gamma-globin in the adult erythroid
progenitor cells. Van Dijk et al. (2010) concluded that FOP is a
critical regulator of fetal globin gene expression.

Using yeast 2-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation analyses, van Dijk et al.
(2010) found that mouse Fop interacted with the methyltransferase Prmt1
(602950). The GAR domain of Fop was heavily methylated by Prmt1 and
Prmt5 (604045) in vitro and in vivo, and both methyltransferases
competed for Fop binding. Knockdown of FOP in estrogen-responsive MCF7
human breast cancer cells via small interfering RNA almost completely
blocked estrogen-induced promoter occupancy by ER-alpha (ESR1; 133430)
and reduced expression of the estrogen-responsive genes PS2 (TFF1;
113710), lactoferrin (LTF; 150210), and TGF-alpha (TGFA; 190170).

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the CHTOP gene to chromosome 1q21.3 based on an
alignment of the CHTOP sequence (GenBank GENBANK AL050260) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

ANIMAL MODEL

Zullo et al. (2009) found that Srag knockout in mice was embryonic
lethal and incompatible with viability in mouse embryonic fibroblasts
and stem cells.

609168	TITLE *609168 SHUGOSHIN-LIKE 1; SGOL1
;;SGO; SGO1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Kitajima et al. (2004) cloned yeast Sgo1 and Sgo2, and by database
analysis, they identified 2 similar human proteins, SGOL1 and SGOL2
(612425), which they referred to as Q9BVA8 and tripin, respectively. All
Sgo-like proteins contain an N-terminal coiled-coil domain and a
C-terminal basic region.

By searching for sequences similar to Xenopus Sgo, Salic et al. (2004)
identified mouse and human SGOL1, which they called SGO. The human
protein shares significant similarity with mouse and frog Sgo at the N-
and C-terminal ends.

Wang et al. (2008) noted that full-length SGO1 contains 527 amino acids.
An SGO1 splice variant lacking exon 6 encodes a 292-amino acid isoform
designated sSGO1. Using fluorescence microscopy, Wang et al. (2008)
showed that full-length SGO1 localized to kinetochores during mitosis.
In contrast, sSGO1 localized to centrosomes at interphase and to spindle
poles at mitosis, but not to kinetochores.

GENE FUNCTION

Salic et al. (2004) determined that the N terminus of mouse Sgo bound
and stabilized microtubules. Following transfection in HeLa cells,
epitope-tagged mouse Sgo localized to kinetochores between the fibrous
corona and the underlying centromeric chromatin, around the inner or
outer kinetochore plate. Endogenous HeLa cell SGOL1 was degraded by both
CDC20 (603618)- and CDH1 (603619)-activated anaphase-promoting complex
(APC), resulting in loss of SGOL1 from kinetochores during the
metaphase-to-anaphase transition. SGOL1 depletion by RNA interference
(RNAi) caused mitotic arrest with loss of sister kinetochore cohesion.
Chromosomes and their centromeres did not align to form a metaphase
plate; instead they scattered throughout the cell. SGOL1 depletion also
destabilized kinetochore microtubules. Salic et al. (2004) concluded
that SGOL1 is required for mitotic progression and chromosome
segregation and provides a link between sister centromere cohesion and
microtubule interactions at kinetochores.

Tang et al. (2004) found that depletion of BUB1 (602452) and SGO1 in
HeLa cells by RNAi caused massive missegregation of sister chromatids
that originated at centromeres. Loss of chromatid cohesion in BUB1 and
SGO1 RNAi cells did not appear to require activation of separase (see
604143), but instead triggered mitotic arrest dependent on MAD2 (601467)
and Aurora B (604970). Tang et al. (2004) determined that BUB1 maintains
the steady-state level and centromeric localization of SGO1, and they
concluded that BUB1 protects centromeric cohesion in mitosis through
SGO1.

Riedel et al. (2006) showed in both fission and budding yeast that Sgo1
recruited to centromeres a specific form of protein phosphatase-2A
(PP2A; 176915). Its inactivation caused loss of centromeric cohesin (see
RAD21; 606462) at anaphase I and random segregation of sister
centromeres at the second meiotic division. Artificial recruitment of
PP2A to chromosome arms prevented Rec8 (608193) phosphorylation and
hindered resolution of chiasmata. Riedel et al. (2006) concluded that
their data were consistent with the notion that efficient cleavage of
Rec8 requires phosphorylation of cohesin and that this is blocked by
PP2A at meiosis I centromeres.

In mitotic cells, phosphorylation of cohesin promotes its dissociation
from chromosomes, but centromeric cohesin is protected from
phosphorylation until kinetochores are properly captured by the spindle
microtubules. Kitajima et al. (2006) found that a shugoshin complex made
up of SGO1, SGO2, and a specific subtype of PP2A containing the
regulatory B56 subunit (see 601643) was required for protection of
centromeric cohesin in HeLa cells. The shugoshin-PP2A complex protected
cohesin by reversing phosphorylation of the cohesin subunit SA2 (STAG2;
300826). Both SGO1 and SGO2 bound PP2A directly, although SGO1 appeared
to bind the regulatory subunit PP2A-B56, while SGO2 appeared to bind the
core subunit PP2A-A (see 605983). Knockdown studies showed that SGO2
tethered PP2A to the centromere, whereas SGO1 had the more important
role in centromere protection and appeared to facilitate PP2A function
at centromeres.

Brar et al. (2006) showed that phosphorylation of the cohesin subunit
REC8 contributes to stepwise cohesin removal. Their data further
implicated 2 other key regulators of meiotic chromosome segregation, the
cohesin protector SGO1 and meiotic recombination in bringing about the
stepwise loss of cohesins and thus the establishment of the meiotic
chromosome segregation pattern.

Wang et al. (2008) found that SGO1 depletion via RNA interference
induced formation of multiple centrosome-like structures in mitotic HeLa
cells due to separation of paired centrioles. Sgo1 +/- mouse embryonic
fibroblasts displayed split centrosomes. sSGO1 interacted with PLK1
(602098) in HeLa cells, and mutation of PLK1 phosphorylation sites in
sSGO1 (ser73 and thr146) resulted in mislocalization of sSGO1 from
mitotic spindle poles. Centriole splitting induced by SGO1 depletion or
expression of a dominant-negative mutant was suppressed by ectopic
expression of sSGO1 or by PLK1 knockdown. Wang et al. (2008) concluded
that sSGO1 plays an essential role in protecting centriole cohesion,
which is partly regulated by PLK1.

Yamagishi et al. (2008) showed that the requirement of heterochromatin
for mitotic chromosome segregation is largely replaced by forcibly
enriching cohesin at centromeres in fission yeast. However, this
enrichment of cohesin is not sufficient to replace the meiotic
requirement for heterochromatin. Yamagishi et al. (2008) found that the
heterochromatin protein Swi6 (whose human homolog is HP1, 604478)
associates directly with meiosis-specific shugoshin Sgo1, a protector of
cohesin at centromeres. A point mutation of Sgo1 (V243E), which
abolishes the interaction with Swi6, impairs the centromeric
localization and function of Sgo1. The forced centromeric localization
of Sgo1 restores proper meiotic chromosome segregation in swi6-delta
cells. Yamagishi et al. (2008) also showed that the direct link between
HP1 and shugoshin is conserved in human cells. Yamagishi et al. (2008)
suggested that the recruitment of shugoshin is the important primary
role for centromeric heterochromatin in ensuring eukaryotic chromosome
segregation.

Kawashima et al. (2010) demonstrated that BUB1 (602452) phosphorylates
the conserved ser121 of histone H2A in fission yeast S. pombe. The
h2a-SA mutant, in which all cellular H2A-S121 is replaced with alanine,
phenocopies the Bub1 kinase-dead mutant (bub1-KD) in losing the
centromeric localization of shugoshin proteins. Artificial tethering of
shugoshin to centromeres largely restores the h2a-SA or bub1-KD-related
chromatin instability defects, a function that is evolutionarily
conserved. Kawashima et al. (2010) concluded that Bub1 kinase creates a
mark for shugoshin localization and the correct partitioning of
chromosomes.

MAPPING

Hartz (2005) mapped the SGOL1 gene to chromosome 3p24.3 based on an
alignment of the SGOL1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF308299) with the
genomic sequence.

610980	TITLE *610980 KCNQ1 DOWNSTREAM NEIGHBOR; KCNQ1DN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Imprinting is a phenomenon in which epigenetic modifications lead to
expression or suppression of alleles of some genes based on their
parental origin. Wilms tumor-2 (WT2; 194071) is defined by
maternal-specific loss of heterozygosity of a critical region on
chromosome 11p15.5 that includes several imprinted genes. KCNQ1DN is an
imprinted gene located within the WT2 critical region that is expressed
from the maternal allele (Xin et al., 2000).

CLONING

By sequence analysis of the WT2 critical region, followed by database
analysis and screening a testis cDNA library, Xin et al. (2000) cloned
KCNQ1DN. KCNQ1DN has a small ORF encoding 68 amino acids, but it lacks a
Kozak consensus sequence around the initiator ATG, suggesting it is not
translated. Scott (2007) failed to identify sequences related to the
predicted 68-amino acid protein in other species through database
analysis, providing further evidence that KCNQ1DN is not translated.
Using RT-PCR, Xin et al. (2000) detected expression of KCNQ1DN in adult
brain, heart, kidney, testis, and placenta. KCNQ1DN expression was
present in fetal kidney between 82 and 103 days of gestation. RT-PCR
showed monoallelic expression of KCNQ1DN in fetal kidney and maternal
expression of KCNQ1DN in placenta.

GENE FUNCTION

Using RT-PCR, Xin et al. (2000) found that KCNQ1DN expression was absent
in 7 of 18 Wilms tumors. In contrast, other nearby maternally expressed
genes, including CDKN1C (600856), IMPT1 (SLC22A18; 602631), and IPL
(PHLDA2; 602131), were normally expressed. Xin et al. (2000) concluded
that KCNQ1DN may be involved in Wilms tumorigenesis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Xin et al. (2000) determined that the KCNQ1DN gene contains at least 2
exons, and they identified an upstream CpG island.

611605	TITLE *611605 ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM LIPID RAFT-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 2; ERLIN2
;;SPFH DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; SPFH2;;
CHROMOSOME 8 OPEN READING FRAME 2; C8ORF2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By genomic sequence analysis, followed by PCR and RACE of adult and
fetal cDNA libraries, Ikegawa et al. (1999) cloned 2 splice variants of
ERLIN2, which they designated C8ORF2. The deduced 339- and 152-amino
acid proteins share the first 141 N-terminal amino acids, then diverge.
Both proteins have an N-glycosylation site and type-2 membrane topology,
and the longer protein has a lysine- and glutamic acid-rich region.
Northern blot analysis detected ubiquitous expression of 1.6- and 2.5-kb
transcripts; a minor 4.4-kb transcript was also observed.

Using monoclonal antibodies to human lipid raft proteins, Browman et al.
(2006) identified ERLIN1 (611604) and ERLIN2 as components of lipid
rafts. Immunohistochemical analysis of endogenous and
fluorescence-tagged proteins revealed that ERLIN1 and ERLIN2 localized
specifically to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and nuclear envelope. The
2 proteins share 83% identity, and both contain a conserved prohibitin
(PHB; 176705) homology domain of about 160 amino acids.

GENE FUNCTION

The ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway removes aberrant proteins
and metabolically regulated native proteins from the ER. Pearce et al.
(2007) found that SPFH2 associated rapidly with activated IP3 receptors
(see IP3R1; 147265), which are substrates for the ERAD pathway, in
various mammalian cell lines. A proportion of SPFH2 associated with
several components of the ERAD pathway, and RNA interference-mediated
depletion of SPFH2 inhibited polyubiquitination and degradation of IP3R1
and turnover of model ERAD substrates. Pearce et al. (2007) concluded
that SPFH2 is a key ERAD pathway component that may act as a substrate
recognition factor.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ikegawa et al. (1999) determined that the ERLIN2 gene contains 16 exons
and spans more than 16.5 kb. The first 4 exons encode alternative
5-prime UTRs, exon 5 contains the initiating methionine, and exons 10
and 16 encode alternative 3-prime UTRs.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Ikegawa et al. (1999) mapped the ERLIN2
gene to chromosome 8p11.2.

CYTOGENETICS

By autozygosity mapping followed by candidate gene sequencing in a
consanguineous Saudi family with complicated SPG18 (611225), Alazami et
al. (2011) identified a homozygous 20-kb deletion on chromosome 8, with
the distal breakpoint near physical position 37,694,857 (NCBI36) and the
proximal breakpoint near 37,714,575 immediately upstream of exon 2 of
the ERLIN2 gene. This 20-kb interval spans 2 protein-coding genes,
ERLIN2 and FLJ34378. RT-PCR analysis of patient lymphoblasts showed loss
of ERLIN2 transcription, consistent with a null allele. Alazami et al.
(2011) noted that ERLIN2 is involved in the endoplasmic
reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, and postulated that
loss of ERLIN2 may result in persistent activation of IP3 signaling and
neuronal channel activity since ERAD normally degrades IP3 receptors.
Alazami et al. (2011) concluded that ERLIN2 depletion caused the
phenotype, although they could not exclude a role for FLJ34378.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of a consanguineous Turkish family with autosomal
recessive spastic paraplegia-18 (SPG18; 611225), Yildirim et al. (2011)
identified a truncation mutation in the ERLIN2 gene (611605.0001) by
linkage analysis followed by candidate gene sequencing. The authors
termed the disorder 'intellectual disability, motor dysfunction, and
contractures (IDMDC).' Affected individuals presented between ages 6
months and 2 years with an arrest and regression of motor function. They
developed progressive severe contractures of all joints, resulting in
severe motor disability and a fixed position. All had severe
intellectual disability, and none could speak, read, or write. Features
suggestive of spasticity included hyperactive reflexes, ankle clonus,
and extensor plantar responses, but the neurologic examination was
difficult to perform in most. Electron microscopy of white blood cells
from 2 affected sibs showed large membrane-bound vacuoles containing
flocculent material in 7 to 10% of cells, and these vacuoles appeared to
be associated with the endoplasmic reticulum.

In affected members of a consanguineous Turkish family with autosomal
recessive intellectual disability, motor dysfunction, and contractures,
or spastic paraplegia-18 (SPG18; 611225), Yildirim et al. (2011)
identified a 2-bp insertion (812insAC) in exon 11 of the ERLIN2 gene,
resulting in a frameshift and premature termination in the
oligomerization domain. The protein was predicted to be truncated by
20%, but the mutant transcript did not appear to undergo
nonsense-mediated decay. The mutation was not found in 109 control
individuals.

612962	TITLE *612962 DYNACTIN 5; DCTN5
;;p25
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Dynactin (see 601143) is a multimeric protein essential for
minus-end-directed transport driven by the microtubule-based motor
dynein (see DYNC1H1; 600112). DCTN5 is a subunit of the pointed-end
subcomplex of dynactin that is thought to interact with membranous cargo
(Parisi et al., 2004).

CLONING

Eckley et al. (1999) identified Dctn5, which they called p25, as a
component of the pointed-end dynactin subcomplex in bovine brain. By
database analysis, they identified mouse p25, which encodes a 182-amino
acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 20.1 kD. Eckley et al.
(1999) also identified p25 orthologs in fly and worm.

By searching databases for proteins containing an isoleucine-patch motif
predicted to adopt a left-handed parallel beta-helix fold, Parisi et al.
(2004) identified mouse p25.

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the DCTN5 gene to chromosome 16p12.2 based on an
alignment of the DCTN5 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK027387) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

613534	TITLE *613534 FANCD2/FANCI-ASSOCIATED NUCLEASE 1; FAN1
;;MYOTUBULARIN-RELATED PROTEIN 15; MTMR15;;
KIAA1018
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

FAN1 is a DNA endo- and exonuclease involved in the repair of DNA damage
caused by crosslinking agents. FAN1 is recruited to sites of interstrand
cross linkage damage by interacting with the FANCI (611360)-FANCD2
(227646) complex (MacKay et al., 2010; Kratz et al., 2010; Smogorzewska
et al., 2010).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned FAN1, which they designated
KIAA1018. The deduced protein contains 1,017 amino acids. RT-PCR
analysis detected relatively uniform FAN1 expression in all adult and
fetal tissues and specific adult brain regions examined.

Kratz et al. (2010) stated that the FAN1 protein contains a predicted
N-terminal RAD18 (605256)-like ubiquitin (191339)-binding zinc finger
domain and a C-terminal nuclease domain.

Zhou et al. (2012) found expression of the FAN1 gene in multiple
parenchymatous human tissues, including the kidney, liver, neuronal
tissue, and female reproductive organs. The expression pattern differed
from that of FANCD2, which was found primarily in lymphatic and bone
marrow-derived sources, as well as in skin and testes.

GENE FUNCTION

Using tandem affinity purification and large-scale immunoprecipitation
analysis, followed by mass spectroscopy, Cannavo et al. (2007)
identified FAN1 as a protein that interacted with the mismatch repair
proteins MLH1 (120436), PMS1 (600258), and PMS2 (600259).

Independently, MacKay et al. (2010) and Kratz et al. (2010) found that
recombinant human FAN1 exhibited DNA endonuclease activity toward
5-prime flaps and had 5-prime exonuclease activity mediated by its
C-terminal nuclease domain. Only DNA damage caused by interstrand
crosslinking agents resulted in recruitment of FAN1 to sites of DNA
damage, and this recruitment required interaction of FAN1 with
monoubiquitinated FANCD2. Depletion of FAN1 sensitized human cell lines
to interstrand crosslinking agents and caused chromosomal instability.
Smogorzewska et al. (2010) reported similar findings and showed that
FAN1 required both FANCI and FANCD2 for localization at sites of DNA
damage.

A central event in the Fanconi pathway is monoubiquitylation of the
FANCI-FANCD2 protein complex. Liu et al. (2010) characterized FAN1,
which promotes interstrand crosslink repair in a manner strictly
dependent on its ability to accumulate at or near sites of DNA damage
and that relies on monoubiquitylation of the FANCI-FANCD2 complex. Liu
et al. (2010) concluded that the monoubiquitylated complex recruits the
downstream repair protein FAN1 and facilitates repair of DNA interstrand
crosslinks.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1999) mapped the FAN1
gene to chromosome 15.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 9 unrelated families with karyomegalic
interstitial nephritis (KMIN; 614817), Zhou et al. (2012) identified 12
different homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the FAN1 gene
(see, e.g., 613534.0001-613534.0008). Eight of the 12 mutations resulted
in a truncated protein. The first mutation was identified by
homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing in 1 affected family. Upon
exposure to mitomycin C, FAN1 mutant cells showed genomic instability,
as manifest by increased chromatid breaks and radial chromosomes on
metaphase spreads. Although the results of the test for Fanconi anemia
(see, e.g., 227650), diepoxybutane-induced breakage, were negative in
FAN1-mutant cells lines, these cells still showed decreased survival in
response to either inducer of interstrand crosslink repair (ICL)
compared to controls. Thus, there were subtle differences in cell
reaction between FANCA (607139)-mutant and FAN1-mutant cells, suggesting
that these proteins act in somewhat distinct manners. None of the FAN1
mutant proteins was able to correct mitomycin C-induced decreased
survival in cells lacking FAN1 nuclease activity. Morpholino knockdown
of Fan1 in zebrafish embryos resulted in a nephronophthisis (NPHP;
256100)-like phenotype, with shortened and curved body axis, as well as
a Fanconi anemia-like phenotype, with microcephaly, microphthalmia, and
massive apoptosis. There was evidence of activation of the DNA damage
repair pathway, as demonstrated by increased signaling for gamma-H2AX
(H2AFX; 601772). Knockdown of born Fan1 and p53 (191170) in zebrafish
caused renal cysts, reminiscent of a ciliopathy. In the fawn-hooded
hypertensive rat, an animal model of chronic kidney disease, as well as
in kidney samples from humans with genetically heterogeneous forms of
chronic kidney disease, Zhou et al. (2012) found increased nuclear
staining for gamma-H2AX, indicating activation of the DNA damage
response pathway. These findings supported the hypothesis that DNA
lesions and DNA damage response pathways may partially drive renal
damage in NPHP-related ciliopathies and in chronic kidney disease.

heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the FAN1 gene. Both families carried a
T-to-A transition in intron 2 (1234+2T-A), resulting in a splice site
mutation on 1 allele. One family (Godin et al., 1996) carried a 2-bp
deletion in exon 7 (2036_7delGA; 613534.0003) on the second allele, and
the other family carried a 2245C-T transition in exon 9, resulting in an
arg749-to-ter (R749X; 613534.0004) substitution on the second allele.
None of the mutations were found in 96 controls, and haplotype analysis
suggested a founder effect for the splice site mutation.

CHROMOSOME 10 OPEN READING FRAME 61; C10ORF61
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to TCTN1 (609863), Reiter
and Skarnes (2006) identified mouse and human TCTN2 (613846) and TCTN3.
The deduced mouse Tctn3 protein contains 595 amino acids. It has an
N-terminal signal peptide and a C-terminal transmembrane domain that is
conserved in Drosophila tectonic.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the TCTN3 gene to chromosome 10q24.1 based on an
alignment of the TCTN3 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AL050022) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 6 fetuses from 5 consanguineous families with orofaciodigital
syndrome IV (OFD4; 258860), Thomas et al. (2012) identified homozygosity
or compound heterozygosity for truncating mutations in the TCTN3 gene
(613847.0001-613847.0005). Analysis of TCTN3 in a Turkish family with
Joubert syndrome mapping to chromosome 10 (JBTS18; 614815) revealed
homozygosity for a missense mutation (613847.0006) in the 2 affected
sibs. Functional analysis indicated that TCTN3 is necessary for
transduction of the SHH (600725) signaling pathway, as revealed by
abnormal processing of GLI3 (165240) in patient cells.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
OROFACIODIGITAL SYNDROME IV
TCTN3, GLN480TER

In a fetus with orofaciodigital syndrome IV (OFD4; 258860) from a
consanguineous Senegalese family, Thomas et al. (2012) identified
homozygosity for a 1222C-T transition in exon 11 of the TCTN3 gene,
resulting in a gln408-to-ter (Q408X) substitution. Patient fibroblasts
displayed negligible responsiveness to SHH (600725) agonists compared to
controls, and mutant fibroblasts exhibited decreased amounts of
full-length unprocessed GLI3 (165240), a transcriptional target of SHH
signaling, and increased amounts of the cleaved repressor form (GLI3R),
indicating that TCTN3 is essential for GLI3 processing and function.
Thomas et al. (2012) concluded that at least some of the defects in
affected individuals with TCTN3 mutations may be secondary to reduced
SHH signaling.

In 2 fetuses with orofaciodigital syndrome IV (OFD4; 258860) from 2

identified homozygosity for a 4-bp deletion (650_653del) in exon 5 of
the TCTN3 gene, predicted to cause a frameshift resulting in premature
termination (Tyr217SerfsTer6). The mutation segregated in all available
family members from both families with the expected patterns of
autosomal recessive inheritance.

In a fetus with orofaciodigital syndrome IV (OFD4; 258860) from a

homozygosity for a 1327C-T transition in exon 12 of the TCTN3 gene,
resulting in a gln443-to-ter (Q443X) substitution. The mutation
segregated in all available family members with the expected patterns of
autosomal recessive inheritance.

heterozygosity for a 2-bp deletion (566_567del) in exon 4 of the TCTN3
gene (Glu189Valfs*52), and a 2-bp deletion (1348_1349del; 613847.0005)
in exon 12 (Leu450SerfsTer14), both predicted to cause a frameshift and

JOUBERT SYNDROME 18
TCTN3, GLY314ARG

In 2 sibs with Joubert syndrome (JBTS18; 614815) from a consanguineous
Turkish family, Thomas et al. (2012) identified homozygosity for a
940G-A transition in exon 8 of the TCTN3 gene, resulting in a
gly314-to-arg (G314R) substitution at a highly conserved residue. The
mutation was not found in SNP databases, the 1000 Genomes Project, or
150 ethnically matched chromosomes.
