DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SIN1, MTOR (FRAP1; 601231), RICTOR (609022), and LST8 (GBL; 612190) are
components of TORC2, a protein kinase complex involved in AKT (164730)
phosphorylation and cell signaling (Yang et al., 2006).

CLONING

By screening an expression library for cDNAs that suppressed the heat
shock-sensitive phenotype of yeast with an activated Ras2 gene (see
HRAS; 190020), Colicelli et al. (1991) obtained a partial cDNA encoding
MAPKAP1, which they called JC310.

By searching an EST database with the partial JC310 sequence, followed
by RT-PCR, Schroder et al. (2004) obtained a full-length cDNA encoding
MAPKAP1, which they called SIN1. The deduced 522-amino acid protein has
a nuclear localization signal, 2 bipartite nuclear localization signals,
a peroxisomal targeting signal, and a PEST motif for rapid protein
degradation. Comparison of SIN1 with homologs from various species
revealed a short, highly conserved region, designated Box1, located
within a larger conserved domain, designated CRIM (conserved region in
middle). Schroder et al. (2004) also identified several SIN1 splice
variants, including SIN1-alpha, which encodes a 323-amino acid
C-terminally truncated protein, and SIN1-beta and SIN1-gamma, which
encode 487- and 475-amino acid proteins, respectively, with internal
deletions. Two other variants, SIN1-delta and SIN1-epsilon, lack the
first coding exon and the first 2 coding exons of SIN1, respectively.
Northern blot analysis detected SIN1 transcripts of 3.8 and 2.6 kb in
all tissues examined, with highest levels in skeletal muscle and heart.

GENE FUNCTION

Yang et al. (2006) identified SIN1 as an essential component of TORC2,
but not TORC1. SIN1 specifically interacted with MTOR and RICTOR, but
not RAPTOR (607130), the defining component of the TORC1 complex.
Knockdown of SIN1 resulted in decreased RICTOR phosphorylation and
protein levels, as well as disruption of binding between RICTOR and
MTOR. RICTOR knockdown dramatically decreased SIN1 protein levels.
Knockdown of SIN1 in both Drosophila and human cells diminished AKT
phosphorylation, and SIN1-knockdown cells displayed less phosphorylation
of AKT substrates and more sensitivity to apoptosis.

Independently, Jacinto et al. (2006) identified SIN1 as an essential
TORC2 subunit in human cells. Phosphorylation of Akt at ser473 was lost
in Sin1 -/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), whereas phosphorylation
of thr308 was unaffected. Defective ser473 phosphorylation affected only
a subset of Akt targets in vivo, including Foxo1 (136533) and Foxo3a
(602681). Sin1 -/- MEFs were more sensitive to stress-induced apoptosis,
suggesting that phosphorylation of AKT at ser473 plays an important role
in cell survival.

GENE STRUCTURE

Schroder et al. (2004) determined that the MAPKAP1 gene contains 13
exons, the first of which is noncoding. The 5-prime region contains 2
short open reading frames of 9 and 5 codons, and the 3-prime region
contains 2 polyadenylation sites.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the MAPKAP1
gene to chromosome 9 (TMAP RH41772).

ANIMAL MODEL

Jacinto et al. (2006) found that Sin1 deletion was embryonic lethal in
mice due to early developmental problems.
