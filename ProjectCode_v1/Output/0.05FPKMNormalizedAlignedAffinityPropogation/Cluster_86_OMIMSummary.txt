;;PHOSPHOLIPASE C-RELATED CATALYTICALLY INACTIVE PROTEIN 2; PRIP2;;
KIAA1092
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Kikuno et al. (1999) cloned PLCL2, which they designated
KIAA1092. The deduced 1,154-amino acid protein shares significant
similarity with rat 130-kD inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-binding protein
(PLCL1; 600597). RT-PCR ELISA detected very high expression in adult
brain and much lower expression in fetal brain. High expression was also
detected in adult skeletal muscle, ovary, heart, and liver, with lower
expression in all other adult and fetal tissues examined. Within
specific brain regions, highest expression was detected in amygdala,
cerebellum, and caudate nucleus.

Otsuki et al. (1999) cloned mouse Plcl2 from a myoblast cDNA library.
The deduced 1,128-amino acid protein has an N-terminal pleckstrin (PLEK;
173570) homology (PH) domain and putative phospholipase catalytic
domains X and Y. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues detected
highest expression in skeletal muscle, with moderate expression in brain
and spleen. Western blot analysis detected Plcl2 at an apparent
molecular mass of 130 kD in skeletal muscle, brain, thymus, kidney, and
liver. Immunohistochemical analysis of C2C12 mouse myoblasts and
transfected COS-7 cells revealed a cytoplasmic punctate pattern of Plcl2
expression, with concentration in the perinuclear area.

GENE FUNCTION

Otsuki et al. (1999) found that mouse Plcl2 lacked phospholipase
catalytic activity. However, the isolated PH domain of Plcl2 bound
strongly to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) and
moderately to PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(4)P. Plcl2 also bound inositol
1,4,5-trisphosphate.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Kikuno et al. (1999) mapped the PLCL2 gene
to chromosome 3. Using FISH, Otsuki et al. (1999) mapped the PLCL2 gene
to chromosome 3p25-p24.

ANIMAL MODEL

Tsutsumi et al. (2011) stated that they had previously found that female
mice lacking both Prip1 and Prip2 (PLCL2; 614276) (Prip -/- mice) were
subfertile, with high plasma gonadotropin and low gonadal steroid
levels. Tsutsumi et al. (2011) found that bone mineral density and
trabecular bone volume were higher in female Prip -/- mice, but much
less so in male Prip -/- mice. The difference in bone density between
Prip -/- and wildtype females became negligible by 12 months of age.
Ovariectomy resulted in no change in bone measures in Prip -/- mice,
suggesting that the effect of Prip deletion was independent of hormonal
imbalance. Histologic analysis revealed abnormal bone formation in Prip
-/- mice, with enlarged osteoclasts containing more than 15 nuclei and
loose, weakened absorbing surfaces between osteoclasts and bone. Prip
-/- bone marrow cells cultured to differentiate into osteoclasts were
less active and showed elevated Bmp (see 112262)-dependent Smad (see
601595) phosphorylation compared with wildtype cells. Tsutsumi et al.
(2011) concluded that PRIP1 and PRIP2 are involved in negative
regulation of bone formation.

614184	TITLE *614184 DIS3 MITOTIC CONTROL, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG-LIKE 2; DIS3L2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The RNA exosome is an approximately 400-kD multimeric ribonucleolytic
complex that participates in both endonucleolytic and 3-prime/5-prime
exonucleolytic activity in RNA processing and in the degradation of a
variety of RNA substrates. DIS3L2 shares high sequence similarity with
catalytic exosome subunits that have 3-prime/5-prime exonucleolytic
activity (summary by Tomecki et al., 2010).

CLONING

By searching the human genomic database for sequences similar to DIS3L
(614183), Staals et al. (2010) identified 5 potential splice variants of
DIS3L2. The longest deduced protein contains 885 amino acids and has a
calculated molecular mass of 99.2 kD. It has a poorly conserved
N-terminal PIN domain, followed by a cold-shock domain, a putative RNB
exonuclease catalytic domain, and a possible C-terminal S1 RNA-binding
domain.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the DIS3L2 gene to chromosome 2q37.2 based on an
alignment of the DIS3L2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC030113) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

In transfected COS-7 and HeLa cells, Astuti et al. (2012) observed that
DIS3L2 was localized predominantly in the cytoplasm. RNA degradation
assays using transfected HEK293 cells demonstrated that DIS3L2 has
exonuclease activity. Knockdown studies in HeLa cells showed that DIS3L2
inactivation was associated with mitotic abnormalities and altered
expression of mitotic checkpoint proteins, with lowered expression of
TTK (604092), aurora B (AURKB; 604970), and phosphorylated CDC25C
(157680), but upregulation of cyclin B1 (CCNB1; 123836), RAD21 (606462),
and securin (PTTG1; 604147). DIS3L2 overexpression suppressed the growth
of human cancer cell lines, and knockdown enhanced the growth of those
cells. Astuti et al. (2012) concluded that DIS3L2 has a critical role in
RNA metabolism and is essential for the regulation of cell growth and
division.

The pluripotency factor LIN28 (611043) blocks the expression of LET7
(605386) microRNAs in undifferentiated cells during development by
binding to pre-LET7 RNAs and recruiting RNA uridyltransferases ZCCHC11
(613692) and ZCCHC6 to uridylate pre-LET7. The identity of the RNase
that degrades uridylated pre-LET7 was unknown. Chang et al. (2013)
identified Dis3l2 as the 3-prime-5-prime exonuclease responsible for the
decay of uridylated pre-let7 in mouse embryonic stem cells. Biochemical
reconstitution assays showed that 3-prime oligouridylation stimulates
Dis3l2 activity in vitro, and knockdown of Dis3l2 in mouse embryonic
stem cells leads to the stabilization of pre-let7. Chang et al. (2013)
concluded that their study established 3-prime oligouridylation as an
RNA decay signal for DIS3L2 and identified the first physiologic RNA
substrate of this exonuclease.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 8 affected individuals from 6 families with Perlman syndrome (PRLMNS;
267000), Astuti et al. (2012) identified homozygosity or compound
heterozygosity for mutations in the DIS3L2 gene
(614184.0001-614184.0004).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PERLMAN SYNDROME
DIS3L2, 82.8-KB DEL, EX6DEL

In a brother and sister from a consanguineous Pakistani family with
Perlman syndrome (267000), Astuti et al. (2012) identified homozygosity
for an 82.8-kb deletion (367-41553_602+40962del) between exons 5 and 7
of the DIS3L2 gene, resulting in a truncated protein of 258 amino acids.
Functional studies in HEK293 cells demonstrated that mutant DIS3L2
lacking exon 6 had substantially reduced ribonuclease activity. The
mutation segregated with disease in the family and was not found in at
least 300 ancestrally matched samples. The brother died at 3.5 years of
age and the sister at 2 months of age.

.0002
PERLMAN SYNDROME
DIS3L2, 22-KB DEL, EX9DEL

In 3 patients from 2 Dutch families with Perlman syndrome (267000),
previously reported by Henneveld et al. (1999), as well as an unrelated
Dutch infant with this syndrome, Astuti et al. (2012) identified
homozygosity for an approximately 22-kb deletion (951-?_1124+?del)
between exons 8 and 10 of the DIS3L2 gene, resulting in loss of the RNB
domain (gln318_arg375del). Functional studies in HEK293 cells
demonstrated that mutant DIS3L2 lacking exon 9 had substantially reduced
ribonuclease activity. The mutation segregated with disease in both
families and was not found in at least 300 ancestrally matched samples.
All 4 Dutch patients died in infancy. In addition, in a cell line from a
30-week amniotic fluid sample from a male patient with Perlman syndrome,
the exon 9 deletion was found in compound heterozygosity with a 1466G-A
transition in the DIS3L2 gene, resulting in a cys489-to-tyr (C489Y;
614184.0003) substitution at a highly conserved residue.

See 614184.0002 and Astuti et al. (2012).

.0004
PERLMAN SYNDROME
DIS3L2, IVS19, G-A, +5

In a cell line taken from a 14-year-old girl with Perlman syndrome
(267000), previously reported by Neri et al. (1984), Astuti et al.
(2012) identified a heterozygous G-to-A transition in exon 19
(2394+5G-A) of the DIS3L2 gene, predicted to cause skipping or deletion
of exon 19. The mutation segregated with disease in the family and was
not found in at least 300 ancestrally matched control samples. Although
a second mutation was not detected, only the transcript lacking exon 19
was found, suggesting the presence of another mutation that might
abolish transcription or cause mRNA instability.

613574	TITLE *613574 TETRATRICOPEPTIDE REPEAT DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 39B; TTC39B
DESCRIPTION 
MAPPING

Hartz (2010) mapped the TTC39B gene to chromosome 9p22.3 based on an
alignment of the TTC39B sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK091187) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

Teslovich et al. (2010) found that knockdown in mouse liver of the
ortholog Ttc39b via a viral vector resulted in significantly higher
plasma high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Teslovich et al. (2010) performed a genomewide association study of
plasma lipids in more than 100,000 individuals of European ancestry and
reported 95 significantly associated loci (P = less than 5 x 10(-8)),
with 59 showing genomewide significant association with lipid traits for
the first time. The 95 loci contributed not only to normal variation in
lipid traits but also to extreme lipid phenotypes and affected lipid
traits in 3 non-European populations (East Asians, South Asians, and
African Americans). Teslovich et al. (2010) identified dbSNP rs581080, a
SNP in the TTC39B gene on chromosome 9p22, as having an effect on HDL-C
concentrations with an effect size of -0.65 mg per deciliter and a P
value of 3 x 10(-12). In liver, the allele associated with decreased
expression correlated with increased HDL-C.

606400	TITLE *606400 CALPAIN 7; CAPN7
;;PALB, ASPERGILLUS NIDULANS, HOMOLOG OF; PALBH
DESCRIPTION Calpain is an intracellular, nonlysosomal cysteine protease whose
activity is regulated by calcium. Micro- and millicalpains (CAPN1,
114220, and CAPN2, 114230, respectively), which differ in their calcium
requirements for protease activity, are ubiquitously expressed. Other
calpains are expressed in specific tissues, such as CAPN3 (114240) and
CAPN9 (606401), which are predominant in skeletal muscle and
gastrointestinal tissue, respectively (Huang and Wang, 2001).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for homologs of the atypical Aspergillus
calpain Palb, followed by RACE, Futai et al. (2001) obtained cDNAs
encoding mouse and human CAPN7, which they termed PALBH. The deduced
814-amino acid human protein contains a calpain-like cysteine protease
domain and a C-terminal PBH domain. Northern blot analysis revealed wide
expression of a 3.8-kb CAPN7 transcript. Expression was strong in
pancreas, moderate in skeletal muscle, liver, and placenta, and weak in
kidney, lung, brain, and heart. Western blot analysis detected
expression of a 92-kD protein. Immunofluorescence microscopy
demonstrated nuclear expression of CAPN7, unlike other calpains.
Functional analysis could not demonstrate complementation in mutant
yeast or activity against conventional calpain substrates.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Futai et al. (2001) mapped the CAPN7 gene
to 3p24.

611411	TITLE *611411 CALCIUM/CALMODULIN-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE KINASE 1, ALPHA; CAMKK1
;;CAMKK-ALPHA; CAMKKA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CAMKK1 catalyzes the phosphorylation and activation of Ca(2+)/calmodulin
kinase (CaMK) as an upstream component of the CaMK cascade that has been
implicated in neuronal gene transcription, synaptic plasticity, and
long-term memory consolidation (Blaeser et al., 2006).

CLONING

By screening a rat brain cDNA library using partial amino acid sequence
of a 68-kD purified rat brain CaMK kinase, followed by 5-prime RACE,
Tokumitsu et al. (1995) cloned rat Camkk1. The deduced 505-amino acid
protein has a calculated molecular mass of 56 kD. Camkk1 shares 30 to
40% amino acid identity over the catalytic domains of serine/threonine
kinases such as the CaM-kinase family (see CAMK2A; 114078). Camkk1
contains a 22-amino acid proline-, arginine-, and glycine-rich insert
between the ATP-binding motif and DGF kinase motif that is similar to
the insert in yeast Ste11. Northern blot analysis of rat tissues
detected high expression in forebrain, lower expression in cerebellum,
and detectable signal in thymus and spleen.

GENE FUNCTION

Using Western blot analysis or gel overlay, Tokumitsu et al. (1995)
showed that Camkk1 binds calmodulin (CALM1; 114180) and activated Camk4
(114080) with a 6-fold increase in total activity and a 100-fold
increase in Camk4 Ca(2+)-independent activity. Camkk1 catalyzed a
10-fold increase in the total activity of Camk1 (604998) and had no
effect on Camk2 (see CAMK2A; 114078). Cotransfection of COS-7 cells with
Camkk1 and Camk4 resulted in a 14-fold increase in CRE-binding protein
(CREB1; 123810)-dependent transcription compared with Camk4 alone,
suggesting that Camkk1 enhances Camk4-mediated transcriptional
regulation.

Using pharmacologic inhibitors to block potential pathways involved in
cytomegalovirus (CMV)-mediated activation of glycolysis, McArdle et al.
(2011) found that inhibition of CAMKK, but not CAMK2 or protein kinase A
(PKA; see 176911), blocked CMV-mediated glycolysis activation. CMV
infection also induced CAMKK1 mRNA and protein expression. Inhibition of
CAMKK had a negligible impact on CMV immediate-early protein
accumulation, but it severely attenuated production of CMV viral
progeny, reduced expression of 1 early CMV gene, and blocked viral DNA
replication. CAMKK inhibition had no impact on herpes simplex virus
(HSV)-1-induced glycolytic activation and a limited impact on HSV-1
replication. McArdle et al. (2011) concluded that CAMKK has a role that
is CMV specific and that it is an important factor in both CMV
replication and glycolytic activation.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the CAMKK1
gene to chromosome 17 (TMAP SHGC-32989).

ANIMAL MODEL

Blaeser et al. (2006) generated mice with targeted disruption of Camkk1
and carried out a variety of behavioral and learning and memory tests.
Mutant mice exhibited normal long-term spatial memory, cued fear memory,
basal synaptic transmission, and long-term potentiation. However, mutant
mice displayed deficient long-term contextual fear memory, as measured
in the post-shock freezing response. Mutant mice displayed decreased
stress-induced anxiety-like behavior; however, other measures of anxiety
such as the elevated plus maze and open field tests showed no difference
from wildtype. Blaeser et al. (2006) concluded that Camkk1 plays a
selective role in contextual fear memory. They showed that mice lacking
Camkk1 displayed decreased phosphorylation and activation of Camk4 and
Creb in specific brain areas involved in contextual fear memory
formation.
