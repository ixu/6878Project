DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Phospholipases A2 (PLA2s) catalyze hydrolysis of the sn-2 acyl-ester
bonds in phospholipids, leading to the release of arachidonic acid and
other fatty acids. PLA2G6 is a calcium-independent PLA2 (Forsell et al.,
1999).

CLONING

Tang et al. (1997) purified an 85-kD cytosolic calcium-independent PLA2,
termed iPLA2, from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. They isolated a
partial human cDNA from a Burkitt lymphoma cDNA library by screening
with a CHO cDNA. Northern blot analysis revealed that iPLA2 is expressed
in a variety of rodent tissues.

Larsson et al. (1998) cloned human iPLA2 cDNAs and discovered multiple
mRNA isoforms resulting from alternative splicing. The full-length cDNA
encodes an 806-amino acid protein with a lipase motif and 8 ankyrin
repeats. Human and rodent iPLA2 share 90% overall amino acid sequence
identity, with the human sequence differing in containing a 54-residue
insertion that would interrupt the last putative ankyrin repeat. Two of
the alternatively spliced forms encode only the ankyrin repeat region of
the protein. Coexpression of these variants with the active iPLA2 enzyme
resulted in a decrease of the enzyme's activity.

By computational analysis, Forsell et al. (1999) identified several
human iPLA2 variants that were alternatively spliced at exons 3, 9, 9a,
and 10a, as well as part of exon 14. Northern blot analysis detected
iPLA2 transcripts of 1.8, 2.0, 3.2, and 4.2 kb. The 2.0-kb variant was
expressed at variable levels in all tissues examined, the 3.2-kb and
4.2-kb transcripts were expressed at variable levels in most tissues
examined, and the 1.8-kb transcript was expressed predominantly in heart
and skeletal muscle, with lower levels in bone marrow. Western blot
analysis of fractionated transfected COS-7 cells showed that full-length
human iPLA2 associated with membranes. Hydropathy plot and bioinformatic
analyses suggested that iPLA2 contains 2 hydrophobic regions that may be
transmembrane domains.

Using rat iPla2 to screen a human insulinoma cDNA library, followed by
RT-PCR of human islet RNA, Ma et al. (1999) cloned long and short iPLA2
splice variants. The short variant lacks an insert encoding a 54-amino
acid proline-rich region in the long variant. This insert interrupts the
last putative ankyrin repeat and is likely to function as a linker
region that separates the N-terminal protein-binding domain from the
C-terminal catalytic domain. RT-PCR detected these 2 transcripts in a
human promonocytic cell line and in normal islet cells. SDS-PAGE showed
that the recombinant short and long isoforms of human iPLA2 had apparent
molecular masses of 85 kD and 88 kD, respectively.

GENE STRUCTURE

Forsell et al. (1999) determined that the PLA2G6 gene contains 19 exons,
including the alternative exons 9a and 10a, and spans more than 69 kb.
The promoter region lacks a TATA box, but contains a CpG island and
several potential SP1 (189906)-binding sites. The 5-prime flanking
region also contains an inverted MER53 sequence and an Alu element.

MAPPING

Ma et al. (1999) mapped the PLA2G6 gene to chromosome 22q13.1 by FISH.

GENE FUNCTION

Tang et al. (1997) found that expression of the hamster iPla2 cDNA
generated an active 85-kD protein that selectively hydrolyzed sn-2 over
sn-1 fatty acids.

Forsell et al. (1999) found that COS-7 cells expressing full-length
human iPLA2 and rat vascular smooth muscle cells showed
Ca(2+)-independent release of arachidonic acid from radiolabeled
phospholipids, and that the activity was associated with the membrane
fractions.

Ma et al. (1999) found that both recombinant short and long isoforms of
human iPLA2 had Ca(2+)-independent PLA2 activity in cytosolic and
membrane fractions. Their activities were inhibited by bromoenol
lactone, an iPLA2 suicide substrate. The long iPLA2 isoform, but not the
short isoform, was activated by ATP.

Turk and Ramanadham (2004) stated that the shorter iPLA2 isoforms that
lack the C-terminal catalytic domain function as negative modulators of
iPLA2-beta, the full-length isoform. They also noted that iPLA2-beta can
be proteolytically processed to yield truncated products that are
constitutively active. Turk and Ramanadham (2004) reviewed the role of
iPLA2 in phospholipid remodeling, signal transduction, cell
proliferation, and endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated apoptosis. They
stated that, in pancreatic islets, beta cells, and insulinoma cells,
iPLA2-beta participates in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, but it
is not involved in membrane phospholipid remodeling.

Arachidonic acid and its metabolites are involved in regulation of
endothelial cell proliferation. Herbert and Walker (2006) showed that
bromoenol lactone-mediated inhibition of iPLA2-VIA activity in human
endothelial cells blocked endothelial cell growth and inhibited DNA
synthesis in a dose-dependent manner. These effects were reversed upon
the exogenous addition of arachidonic acid. iPLA2-VIA activity was
required for expression of the cyclin A (see CCNA1; 604036)/CDK2
(116953) complex, and thus inhibition of iPLA2-VIA blocked S phase
progression and resulted in exit from the cell cycle. Inhibition of
iPLA2-VIA-mediated endothelial cell proliferation was sufficient to
block angiogenic tubule formation by human endothelial cells cocultured
with human dermal fibroblasts. Herbert and Walker (2006) concluded that,
by generating arachidonic acid, iPLA2-VIA regulates endothelial cell S
phase progression, cell cycle residence, and angiogenesis. They noted
that iPLA2-VIA is involved in cell growth and division in other cell
types through arachidonic acid-independent regulation of
glycerophospholipid metabolism during the cell cycle.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Neurodegeneration with Brain Iron Accumulation 2A and 2B
and Karak Syndrome

In studies of 12 families with infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (INAD,
NBIA2A; 256600) and a large consanguineous Pakistani family with
neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA2B; 610217), Morgan
et al. (2006) mapped a novel INAD locus to 22q12.3-q13.2 (lod score
4.78), with evidence of locus heterogeneity. They also detected linkage
to 22q12-q13 in a family with NBIA (lod score 4.65) suggesting allelism.
After sequencing 70 of the approximately 100 positional candidate genes,
they detected mutations in PLA2G6 in 4 kindreds, including the Pakistani
family with NBIA2B and 3 INAD probands (603604.0001-603604.0005). They
also identified PLA2G6 mutations in 28 additional probands with INAD and
in the original family with Karak syndrome and high basal ganglia iron
(see 610217). In all, they identified 44 unique mutations (32 missense,
5 deletions leading to frameshift, 3 nonsense, 2 leading to amino acid
deletions without frameshift, 1 splice site, and 1 large deletion). Of
the missense mutations, 85% occurred at amino acid positions that are
conserved in vertebrates.

In an independent study, Khateeb et al. (2006) identified a homozygous
mutation in PLA2G6 in 2 consanguineous Israeli Bedouin kindreds with
infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (NBIA2A). The 3-bp deletion
(603604.0004) resulted in the deletion of valine-691.

Gregory et al. (2008) found PLA2G6 mutations in 45 (79%) of 56 patients
with INAD1 (NBIA2A) and in 6 (20%) of 23 patients with idiopathic NBIA2B
(see, e.g., 603604.0006-603604.0008). No PLA2G6 mutations were found in
11 patients with clinical evidence of INAD, including 5 in whom
spheroids were reported on peripheral nerve biopsy. All 28 patients with
2 null mutations or homozygous for any mutation had early onset and
rapidly progressive disease. Patients with the less severe phenotype of
NBIA tended to have compound heterozygous missense mutations, consistent
with residual protein function.

- Parkinson Disease 14

In 2 unrelated families with adult-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (PARK14;
612953), Paisan-Ruiz et al. (2009) identified 2 different homozygous
mutations in the PLA2G6 gene (R741Q; 603604.0009 and R747W; 603604.0010,
respectively). The disorder was characterized by rapidly progressive
cognitive decline, bradykinesia, rigidity, and dystonia. None of the 3
affected patients had evidence of brain iron accumulation. The authors
emphasized that PLA2G6 mutations should be considered in patients with
neurodegeneration even without brain iron on MRI scan.

ANIMAL MODEL

Bao et al. (2004) obtained Ipla2-beta-null mice at a mendelian ratio.
They found that spermatozoa from Ipla2-beta -/- mice had reduced
motility and impaired ability to fertilize mouse oocytes in vitro and in
vivo. Female Ipla2-beta -/- mice had nearly normal fertility.

Ramanadham et al. (2008) found that Ipla2-beta-null mice had cortical
bone size, trabecular bone volume, bone mineralizing surfaces, and bone
strength similar to wildtype mice at 3 months of age. Both groups showed
declines in these measures with age, but the decline was more pronounced
in Ipla2-beta-null mice. The lower bone mass in Ipla2-beta-null mice was
accompanied by an increase in bone marrow fat. Relative to wildtype
mice, undifferentiated bone marrow stromal cells from knockout mice
expressed higher levels of Pparg (601487) and lower levels of Runx2
(600211) mRNA, and these changes correlated with increased adipogenesis
and decreased osteogenesis in bone marrow stromal cells in knockout
mice.

Malik et al. (2008) found that Pla2g6-null mice developed age-dependent
neurologic impairment that was evident in rotarod, balance, and climbing
tests by 13 months of age. Neuropathologic analysis showed numerous
spheroids in the brain similar to those observed in human INAD.
Spheroids contained tubulovesicular membranes and stained strongly with
anti-ubiquitin antibodies. Onset of motor impairment correlated with
increased spheroids throughout the neuropil in nearly all brain regions.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
NEURODEGENERATION WITH BRAIN IRON ACCUMULATION 2A
PLA2G6, TYR790TER

In a proband with classic infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (256600),
Morgan et al. (2006) identified a 2370T-G transversion in exon 17 of the
PLA2G6 gene that was predicted to result in a premature termination in
the protein (tyr790 to stop; Y790X). The parents were known to be
consanguineous and the mutation was present in homozygous state. The
presence of spheroids had been demonstrated.

NEURODEGENERATION WITH BRAIN IRON ACCUMULATION 2B
PLA2G6, LYS545THR

In a large consanguineous Pakistani family with neurodegeneration with
brain iron accumulation-2B (NBIA2B; 610217), Morgan et al. (2006)
identified homozygosity for a missense mutation in exon 12 of the PLA2G6
gene, a 1634A-C transversion that resulted in a lys545-to-thr
substitution (K545T).

.0003
NEURODEGENERATION WITH BRAIN IRON ACCUMULATION 2A
PLA2G6, VAL310GLU

In a case of classic infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (256600), Morgan et
al. (2006) described a 929T-A transversion in exon 7 of the PLA2G6 gene,
predicted to result in a val310-to-glu (V310E) amino acid change in the
protein. The mutation was present in homozygous state.

.0004
NEURODEGENERATION WITH BRAIN IRON ACCUMULATION 2A
PLA2G6, 2-BP DEL, 2070TGT

In a case of classic infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (256600), Morgan et
al. (2006) found a 3-bp deletion in exon 15 of the PLA2G6 gene,
2070_2072delTGT, resulting in deletion of val691 from the protein
(V691del). The mutation was present in homozygous state, or possibly
hemizygous state because of deletion of 1 allele.

In a consanguineous Bedouin kindred with cases of infantile neuroaxonal
dystrophy in 3 separate sibships and in another kindred with a single
affected individual, Khateeb et al. (2006) found the same 3-nucleotide
deletion. The mutation was also found in heterozygosity in a single
individual among 300 unrelated Bedouin controls. Both affected families
and the unrelated carrier had the same haplotype surrounding the
mutation.

.0005
KARAK SYNDROME
PLA2G6, ARG632TRP

In the original family with Karak syndrome (see 610217), Morgan et al.
(2006) detected homozygosity for a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 1894
in exon 14 of the PLA2G6 gene that resulted in a substitution of trp for
arg at codon 632 (R632W).

.0006
NEURODEGENERATION WITH BRAIN IRON ACCUMULATION 2A
PLA2G6, TYR790TER

In 4 patients with infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (256600), Gregory et
al. (2008) identified a homozygous 2370T-G transversion in the PLA2G6
gene, resulting in a tyr790-to-ter (Y790X) substitution. The INAD1
phenotype was characterized by early onset of psychomotor regression
with truncal hypotonia and rapid progression to tetraparesis.

PLA2G6, 2-BP DEL, 2370TG

Neurodegeneration with Brain Iron Accumulation 2A

In a patient with infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (256600), Gregory et
al. (2008) identified a homozygous 2-bp deletion (2370delTG) in the
PLA2G6 gene, which resulted in premature termination at codon 790
similar to the Y790X mutation (603604.0006).

Neurodegeneration with Brain Iron Accumulation 2B

In a patient with NBIA2B (610217), Gregory et al. (2008) identified
compound heterozygosity for the 2370delTG mutation and a 238G-A
transition, resulting in an ala80-to-thr (A80T; 603604.0007)
substitution. The patient presented at 3 years of age with toe walking
and lower extremity spasticity. She developed optic atrophy and became
nonambulatory by 5 years of age with dystonia and dysarthria,
progressing to profound sensorimotor impairment by age 9 years. She died
at age 23 years. Postmortem examination showed neuronal loss, axonal
swelling, and Lewy bodies and neurofibrillary tangles.

PARKINSON DISEASE 14
PLA2G6, ARG741GLN

In 2 affected first cousins from a large consanguineous Indian kindred
segregating adult-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (PARK14; 612953),
Paisan-Ruiz et al. (2009) identified a homozygous 2222G-A transition in
the PLA2G6 gene, resulting in an arg741-to-gln (R741Q) substitution in a
conserved residue. Both had onset at age 26 years of a rapidly
progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by rapid cognitive
decline, bradykinesia, tremor and imbalance, eventually leading to loss
of mobility. Although Paisan-Ruiz et al. (2009) noted that brain MRI
showed no evidence of brain iron accumulation, Gregory et al. (2009)
stated that this disorder could be considered under the umbrella
designation of atypical neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation
(NBIA).

.0010
PARKINSON DISEASE 14
PLA2G6, ARG747TRP

In a Pakistani man, born of consanguineous parents, with adult-onset
dystonia-parkinsonism (612953), Paisan-Ruiz et al. (2009) identified a
homozygous 2239C-T transition in the PLA2G6 gene, resulting in an
arg747-to-trp (R747W) substitution in a conserved region. The patient
had onset at age 18 years of rapid cognitive decline with personality
changes, foot dystonia, parkinsonism, and spasticity. Although
Paisan-Ruiz et al. (2009) noted that brain MRI showed no evidence of
brain iron accumulation, Gregory et al. (2009) stated that this disorder
could be considered under the umbrella designation of atypical
neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA).

.0011
PARKINSON DISEASE 14
PLA2G6, ARG635GLN

In 3 Japanese patients, including 2 sibs, with early-onset Parkinson
disease-14 (612953), Yoshino et al. (2010) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the PLA2G6 gene. All 3 patients
carried a 1904G-A transition, resulting in an arg635-to-gln (R635Q)
substitution in the catalytic domain. The 2 sibs also had a heterozygous
1354C-T transition, resulting in a gln452-to-ter (Q452X; 603604.0012)
substitution, and the third unrelated patient had a heterozygous 216C-A
transversion, resulting in a phe72-to-leu (F72L; 603604.0013)
substitution. Haplotype analysis suggested a founder effect for the
R635Q mutation. All 3 patients had onset before age 30 years of
L-dopa-responsive parkinsonism with varying degrees of cognitive decline
and frontotemporal lobar atrophy. Brain MRI of 1 patient showed iron
accumulation in the substantia nigra and striatum. None of the parents
with heterozygous mutations had signs of the disorder.

PLA2G6, 6.6-KB DEL

In a patient with infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (256600), Tonelli et
al. (2010) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
PLA2G6 gene: a 6.6-kb deletion from intron 4 to 6, resulting in an
in-frame deletion and removal of exons 5 and 6 and a large portion of
the ankyrin repeats motif, and a 109C-T transition in exon 2 resulting
in an arg37-to-ter (R37X; 603604.0015) substitution. Analysis of the
deletion junction in the first mutation showed that both breakpoints
occurred within AluY sequences, suggesting that the deletion was likely
mediated by nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR). The mutations
were predicted to result in an almost complete lack of enzyme activity,
although a gain of function could not be excluded. The patient had a
severe and rapidly progressive disease course, with onset before age 12
months, hypotonia, severe developmental delay with mental retardation,
and no eye contact. Spastic tetraparesis developed by age 18 months.
Skin biopsy showed axonal spheroids. Although brain iron accumulation
was not present, MRI at age 20 months showed hyperintensities on
T2-weighted imaging in the caudate and putamen, suggesting an early
degeneration process. Brain MRI at age 3 years showed cerebellar
cortical atrophy.

PARKINSON DISEASE 14
PLA2G6, ASP331TYR

In a Chinese man, born of consanguineous parents, with early-onset
Parkinson disease (612953), Shi et al. (2011) identified a homozygous
991G-T transversion in the PLA2G6 gene, resulting in an asp331-to-tyr
(D331Y) substitution. The mutation was not found in 300 control
individuals. The patient developed foot dragging and difficulty walking
at age 37 years. Symptoms progressed to include masked facies,
bradykinesia, and rigidity, but no atypical features. He had initial
good response to L-dopa treatment, but developed dyskinesias. Brain MRI
excluded iron deposition. PET scan showed significant reduction in DAT
binding in the basal ganglia. In vitro functional expression studies in
HEK293 cells showed that the mutant PLA2G6 protein had about 30%
residual activity. The patient's clinically unaffected 34-year-old
sister was also homozygous for the mutation, and PET scan showed some
loss of binding. The patient was identified in a cohort of 12 Chinese
families with early-onset parkinsonism who were screened for PLA2G6
mutations; none of the other 11 families carried a PLA2G6 mutation.

607714	TITLE *607714 TNFAIP3-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1; TNIP1
;;NEF-ASSOCIATED FACTOR 1; NAF1;;
A20-BINDING INHIBITOR OF NFKB 1; ABIN1;;
KIAA0113
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen to identify proteins that interact with
the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 Nef protein, Fukushi et al.
(1999) isolated TNIP1, which they designated NAF1, from an activated
leukocyte cDNA library. They obtained full-length NAF1 cDNAs by 5-prime
and 3-prime RACE. Fukushi et al. (1999) identified 2 alternatively
spliced isoforms of NAF1, NAF1-alpha and NAF1-beta, that differ only in
their C-terminal amino acids. NAF1-alpha contains 636 amino acids, and
NAF1-beta contains 640 amino acids. Both isoforms have 4 coiled-coil
domains and a proline-rich C terminus. Northern blot analysis detected a
2.8-kb transcript in all tissues tested, with strong expression in
peripheral blood lymphocytes, spleen, and skeletal muscle, and weak
expression in brain. NAF mRNA was also detected in various human
hematopoietic cell lines.

GENE FUNCTION

Fukushi et al. (1999) determined that the region of NAF1 that interacts
with the HIV-1 Nef protein is located within amino acids 94 to 412.
Overexpression of NAF1 increased cell surface expression of CD4 (186940)
in a reporter cell system, and cotransfection with Nef suppressed
NAF1-induced augmentation of CD4 expression.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen, in vitro pull-down assays, and in vivo
immunoprecipitations, Zhang et al. (2002) determined that NAF1-alpha
interacts directly with ERK2 (176948). EGF (131530) treatment of
NAF1-alpha-transfected human osteosarcoma cells resulted in the
phosphorylation of NAF1-alpha by the EGF/MEK (176872)/ERK2 signal
transduction pathway. Overexpression of NAF1-alpha suppressed ERK2
nuclear translocation following activation and inhibited the
ERK2-dependent transactivation of ELK1 (311040) in a reporter assay.
Zhang et al. (2002) concluded that NAF1 is an attenuator of activated
ERK2 signaling.

GENE STRUCTURE

Fukushi et al. (1999) determined that the NAF1 gene contains 18 exons.
Exon 1 is untranslated.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Fukushi et al. (1999) mapped the NAF1 gene
to chromosome 5q32-q33.1.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using a murine model of allergen-induced asthma, El Bakkouri et al.
(2005) showed that delivery of the nuclear factor kappa-B (NFKB; see
164011) inhibitory protein Abin1 to the lung epithelium resulted in a
significant reduction of allergen-induced eosinophil infiltration into
the lungs. This reduction was associated with an Abin1-induced decrease
in allergen-specific IgE serum levels and a reduction of eotaxin (CCL11;
601156), Il4 (147780), and Il1b (147720) in bronchoalveolar lavage
fluid. El Bakkouri et al. (2005) concluded that NFKB plays a critical
role in the pathogenesis of allergic inflammation and proposed that
inhibiting NFKB could be useful in asthma therapy.

Oshima et al. (2009) showed that mice deficient for Abin1 died during
embryogenesis with fetal liver apoptosis, anemia, and hypoplasia.
Abin1-deficient cells were hypersensitive to tumor necrosis factor (TNF;
191160)-induced programmed cell death, and Tnf deficiency rescued
Abin1-deficient embryos. ABIN1 inhibits caspase-8 (CASP8; 601763)
recruitment to FADD (602457) in TNF-induced signaling complexes,
preventing CASP8 cleavage and programmed cell death. Moreover, ABIN1
directly binds polyubiquitin chains, and this ubiquitin-sensing activity
is required for ABIN1's antiapoptotic activity. Oshima et al. (2009)
concluded that their studies provided insights into how ubiquitination
and ubiquitin-sensing proteins regulate cellular and organismal
survival.

607389	TITLE *607389 SINGLE-STRANDED DNA-BINDING PROTEIN 2; SSBP2
;;SENSOR OF SINGLE-STRANDED DNA COMPLEX, SUBUNIT B2; SOSSB2;;
SOSS COMPLEX, SUBUNIT B2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SSBP2 is a subunit of a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding complex
involved in the maintenance of genome stability (Huang et al., 2009).

CLONING

By positional cloning, Castro et al. (2002) identified a novel gene,
which they designated SSBP2, that is disrupted at the 5q13 breakpoint in
the acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line ML3. EST database searching
revealed that the transcript is similar to the chicken gene CSDP, which
encodes a protein that binds single-stranded pyrimidine-rich
mirror-repeat elements with high specificity. By further database
searching, they identified 2 additional cDNAs encoding single-stranded
DNA-binding proteins, SSBP3 (607390) and SSBP4 (607391). The deduced
362-amino acid SSBP2 protein shares 83% and 73% sequence identity with
SSBP3 and SSBP4, respectively, and 100% identity with the mouse Ssbp2
homolog. SSBP family members share a highly conserved N terminus
followed by a glycine- and proline-rich domain. Northern blot analysis
detected ubiquitous expression of a 1.9-kb SSBP2 transcript. Expression
was high in all hematopoietic tissues, including spleen, lymph node,
peripheral blood, bone marrow, thymus, and fetal liver, with highest
expression in thymus and fetal liver. Expression was also high in heart,
brain, kidney, and skeletal muscle. Of 5 leukemia cell lines tested,
expression was highest in pre-T lymphoblastic leukemia cell line CEM. No
gross inactivating mutations were found in leukemia cell lines or in
primary leukemic blasts from 4 patients.

GENE FUNCTION

Using HEK293 cells for tandem affinity purification, Huang et al. (2009)
identified SOSSA (INTS3; 611347) and SOSSC (613273) as common components
of 2 distinct and complementary ssDNA-binding heterotrimeric complexes
defined by their inclusion of either SOSSB1 (SSBP1; 600439) or SOSSB2
(SSBP2), but not both. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis confirmed that
SOSS complexes formed in HeLa cells independent of DNA damage.
Recombinant heterotrimeric SOSS complexes specifically bound ssDNA, but
not double-stranded DNA. SOSSA served as the central assembly factor,
and SOSSB and SOSSC bound overlapping regions on SOSSA, but they did not
interact directly with each other. Depletion of SOSSA by small
interfering RNA led to dramatic decreases in SOSSB1 and SOSSB2 protein
levels, abrogated targeting of SOSSB1 and SOSSB2 to chromatin, increased
ionizing radiation sensitivity, caused defective G2/M checkpoint, and
impaired homologous recombination repair. Huang et al. (2009)
demonstrated that both SOSS complexes and the CTIP (RBBP8; 604124)/RPA
(see RPA1; 179835) complex acted downstream of the MRE11 (600814)-RAD50
(604040)-NBS1 (NBN; 602667) complex and functioned in DNA damage repair.

GENE STRUCTURE

Castro et al. (2002) determined that the SSBP2, SSBP3, and SSBP4 genes
all contain 17 exons and have identical intron/exon boundaries,
suggesting duplication from a common ancestral gene. They also
identified alternative splicing and additional internal exons for all 3
genes, suggesting the existence of multiple isoforms for each protein.
The SSBP2 gene spans more than 200 kb.

MAPPING

Castro et al. (2002) mapped the SSBP2 gene to chromosome 5q13.3, within
the critical breakpoint region in the AML cell line ML3.

602842	TITLE *602842 GEMININ; GMNN
;;GEM
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

McGarry and Kirschner (1998) described a 25-kD protein, designated
geminin, which inhibits DNA replication and is degraded during the
mitotic phase of the cell cycle. Geminin contains 212 amino acids; it
has a destruction box sequence (RRTLKVIQP) and is ubiquitinated by the
anaphase-promoting complex in vitro.

GENE FUNCTION

In synchronized HeLa cells, McGarry and Kirschner (1998) demonstrated
that geminin is absent during G1 phase, accumulates during S, G2, and M
phases, and disappears at the time of the metaphase-anaphase transition.
Geminin inhibits DNA replication by preventing the incorporation of
minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex into prereplication complex.
McGarry and Kirschner (1998) proposed that geminin inhibits DNA
replication during S, G2, and M phases and that geminin destruction at
the metaphase-anaphase transition permits replication in the succeeding
cell cycle.

Wohlschlegel et al. (2000) demonstrated that geminin interacts tightly
with CDT1 (605525), a replication initiation factor necessary for MCM
loading. Inhibition of DNA replication by geminin in cell-free cDNA
replication extracts could be reversed by the addition of excess CDT1.
In the normal cell cycle, CDT1 is present only in G1 and S phases,
whereas geminin is present in S and G2 phases. Wohlschlegel et al.
(2000) concluded that their results suggest that geminin inhibits
inappropriate origin firing by targeting CDT1.

In a yeast 2-hybrid screen, Del Bene et al. (2004) identified the DNA
replication-inhibitor geminin as a partner of Six3 (603714). Geminin
inhibits cell cycle progression by sequestering Cdt1, the key component
for the assembly of the prereplication complex. Del Bene et al. (2004)
showed that Six3 efficiently competes with Cdt1 directly to bind to
geminin, which reveals how Six3 can promote cell proliferation without
transcription. In common with Six3 inactivation, overexpression of the
geminin gene in medaka induces specific forebrain and eye defects that
are rescued by Six3. Conversely, loss of Gem (in common with gain of
Six3) promotes retinal precursor-cell proliferation and results in
expanded optic vesicles, markedly potentiating Six3 gain-of-function
phenotypes. Del Bene et al. (2004) concluded that the transcription
factor Six3 and the replication-initiation inhibitor geminin act
antagonistically to control the balance between proliferation and
differentiation during early vertebrate eye development.

Luo et al. (2004) showed that murine geminin associates transiently with
members of the Hox-repressing polycomb complex, with the chromatin of
Hox regulatory DNA elements, and with Hox proteins. Gain- and
loss-of-function experiments in the chick neural tube demonstrated that
geminin modulates the anterior boundary of Hoxb9 (142964) transcription,
which suggests a polycomb-like activity for geminin. The interaction
between geminin and Hox proteins prevents Hox proteins from binding to
DNA, inhibits HOX-dependent transcriptional activation of reporter and
endogenous downstream target genes, and displaces Cdt1 (605525) from its
complex with geminin. By establishing competitive regulation, geminin
functions as a coordinator of developmental and proliferative control.

Initiation of DNA replication requires the assembly of a prereplication
complex (pre-RC) in late mitosis and G1, with sequential loading of the
origin recognition complex (see ORC1; 601902), CDC6 (602627), CDT1, and
the MCM2-7 complex (see MCM2; 116945) onto replication origins. Upon
initiation of DNA replication, the pre-RC is disassembled, and CDT1 and
CDC6 are released from the origins to prevent rereplication. Using human
cell lines, Shen et al. (2012) showed that ORCA (LRWD1; 615167) was
required for pre-RC assembly and replication initiation. Knockdown of
ORCA via small interfering RNA reduced association of ORC and MCM2-7
with chromatin and caused failure of cell cycle progression through S
phase. ORCA associated dynamically with different pre-RC components
during the cell cycle: it associated with ORC and CDT1 at G1, with
ORC(2-5) and geminin in S phase, and with ORC(2-5), phosphorylated CDT1,
and phosphorylated geminin during mitosis. ORCA interacted directly with
ORC2 (601182), CDT1, and geminin, and ORC2 was required for ORCA
stability. Overexpression of geminin reduced the affinity of CDT1 for
ORCA, and loss of association between ORCA and CDT1 appeared to be a key
step in disassembling the pre-RC at the end of G1 phase.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Lee et al. (2004) described the crystal structure of the mouse
geminin-Cdt1 (605525) complex using a truncated geminin involving
residues 79-157 and a truncated Cdt1 including residues 172-368. The
N-terminal region of a coiled-coil dimer of truncated geminin interacted
with both N-terminal and C-terminal parts of truncated Cdt1. The primary
interface relied on the steric complementarity between the truncated
geminin dimer and hydrophobic face of the 2 short N-terminal helices of
truncated Cdt1 and, in particular, pro181, ala182, tyr183, phe186, and
leu189. Lee et al. (2004) concluded that the crystal structure, in
conjunction with their biochemical data, indicated that the N-terminal
region of truncated geminin might be required to anchor truncated Cdt1,
and the C-terminal region of truncated geminin prevents access of the
MCM complex to truncated Cdt1 through steric hindrance.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the GMNN
gene to chromosome 6 (TMAP WI-12631).

ANIMAL MODEL

Gonzalez et al. (2006) did not find Gmnn-null mouse embryos at any
postimplantation stages of development. Ablation of Gmnn prevented
formation of the inner cell mass and caused premature endoreduplication
at 8 cells, rather than 32 cells. All cells in Gmnn-deficient embryos
committed to the trophoblast cell lineage and consisted of trophoblast
giant cells only. Gonzalez et al. (2006) concluded that degradation of
geminin during S and gap-like phases by proteasome-mediated degradation
is part of the mechanism regulating endoreduplication.

142810	TITLE *142810 HISTIDYL-tRNA SYNTHETASE; HARS
;;HRS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

HARS catalyzes the covalent ligation of histidine to its cognate tRNA as
an early step in protein biosynthesis (O'Hanlon and Miller, 2002).

CLONING

O'Hanlon et al. (1995) noted that HARS and HARS2 (600783), which they
called HO3, are oriented in a head-to-head configuration and share a
bidirectional promoter. They reported that the deduced 509-amino acid
HARS protein shares 72% amino acid identity with HARS2. Both proteins
contain 3 motifs conserved among class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and
2 signature regions of histidyl-tRNA synthetases. However, HARS and
HARS2 have divergent N-terminal domains that are encoded by the first 2
exons of each gene. HARS has a calculated molecular mass of 57.4 kD.
Northern blot analysis detected a 2.0-kb HARS transcript that was highly
expressed in heart, brain, liver, and kidney.

Using 5-prime RACE with a human kidney cDNA library, O'Hanlon and Miller
(2002) identified several HARS transcripts that differed only in the
lengths of their 5-prime UTRs. O'Hanlon and Miller (2002) noted that
pufferfish and human HARS proteins share 84% amino acid homology,
suggesting a high degree of conservation.

GENE STRUCTURE

O'Hanlon and Miller (2002) determined that the HARS gene contains 13
exons and spans approximately 17.4 kb. The HARS and HARS2 genes share a
bidirectional promoter that lacks TATA and CAAT boxes. Both genes use
multiple transcriptional start sites. HARS also uses a second, more
distal promoter that overlaps the first exons of the HARS2 gene.

MAPPING

Carlock et al. (1985) used a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line with
mutations in 3 genes, HARS, RPS14 (130620) and CHR (118840), in
interspecies cell hybridization experiments, to assign the HARS gene to
chromosome 5. Wasmuth and Carlock (1986) assigned the HARS gene to
chromosome 5 by use of human-Chinese hamster ovary cell hybrids.

By genomic sequence analysis, O'Hanlon and Miller (2002) mapped the HARS
and HARS2 genes to chromosome 5q31.3. HARS and HARS2 exhibit a
head-to-head orientation, with 344 bp separating their ORFs.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 patients from Old Order Amish families in Pennsylvania with Usher
syndrome type III mapping to chromosome 5q (USH3B; 614504), Puffenberger
et al. (2012) identified homozygosity for a missense mutation in the
HARS gene (Y454S; 142810.0001) that was not found in dbSNP 129 or the
1000 Genomes Project. In addition, an Old Order Amish patient from an
unrelated deme in Ontario, Canada, had an identical phenotype and was
homozygous for the same mutation.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
USHER SYNDROME, TYPE IIIB
HARS, TYR454SER

In 2 patients from Old Order Amish families in Pennsylvania with Usher
syndrome type IIIB (USH3B; 614504), Puffenberger et al. (2012)
identified homozygosity for a 1361A-C transversion in the HARS gene,
resulting in a tyr454-to-ser (Y454S) substitution in the interface
between the catalytic domain and the anticodon binding domain. A patient
with an identical phenotype from an unrelated Old Order Amish deme in
Ontario, Canada, was also homozygous for the Y454S mutation. The variant
was not found in dbSNP 129 or the 1000 Genomes Project; it was, however,
detected in 7 of 406 Old Order Amish alleles, for a population-specific
allele frequency of 1.72%. (Puffenberger (2012) stated that the correct
population-specific allele frequency data appear in Table 4;
corresponding data in the text are incorrect.)

.0002
VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
HARS, ARG137GLN (dbSNP rs191391414)

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to a peripheral neuropathy has not been confirmed.

In a 64-year-old man with a 15-year history of impaired sensation in the
lower extremities and electrophysiologic studies suggestive of an axonal
peripheral neuropathy, Vester et al. (2013) identified a heterozygous
410G-A transition (dbSNP rs191391414) in the HARS gene, resulting in an
arg137-to-gln (R137Q) substitution at a highly conserved residue in the
catalytic core of the enzyme. The patient was ascertained from a larger
cohort of 363 individuals with peripheral neuropathy. The R137Q variant
was also found in 3 of over 13,000 control chromosomes. One of the
control carriers had no evidence of neuropathy at age 57 years.
Generation of a yeast strain with deletion of the Hst1 gene (the
ortholog of HARS) showed that the R137Q variant could not complement the
Hst1 deletion, suggesting that it is a loss-of-function allele.
Expression of the R137Q variant specifically in GABA motor nerves of C.
elegans caused gross morphologic defects in commissural axons, with
failure to reach the dorsal nerve cord, axonal beading, defasciculation,
and breaks in the nerve cord. The animals with the variant also showed
locomotor defects. Vester et al. (2013) concluded that the HARS R137Q
variant may be a pathogenic allele that predisposes to the development
of peripheral neuropathy, similar to other ARS mutations (see, e.g.,
GARS, 600287), but noted that a causal link remains unclear.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PLPLA2 is a triglyceride lipase (EC 3.1.1.3) that localizes to lipid
droplets and catalyzes the initial step in triglyceride hydrolysis
(Zimmermann et al., 2004).

CLONING

By searching for genes expressed exclusively in mouse adipose tissue,
Villena et al. (2004) cloned Pnpla2, which they designated desnutrin.
The deduced 486-amino acid protein contains a highly conserved 180-amino
acid N-terminal patatin domain with a glycine-rich region, an active
serine hydrolase motif, and an aspartate active site motif. By database
analysis, Villena et al. (2004) identified human PNPLA2, which shows 88%
amino acid homology to mouse desnutrin. Northern blot analysis detected
a 2.0-kb transcript expressed at high levels in mouse brown and white
adipose tissue and at intermediate levels in heart and testis. Very low
expression was detected in all other mouse tissues examined. Expression
of desnutrin was lower in gonadal fat deposits of genetically obese mice
compared with wildtype mice. Desnutrin mRNA was found only in mature
adipocytes and not in proliferating or confluent mouse preadipocytes.
Expression was rapidly increased in cells induced to differentiate.

GENE FUNCTION

Villena et al. (2004) found that desnutrin mRNA levels were regulated by
the nutritional status of mice, being transiently induced during
fasting. In vitro desnutrin gene expression was upregulated by
dexamethasone in a dose-dependent manner, but not by cAMP, suggesting
that glucocorticoids could mediate the increased desnutrin mRNA levels
observed during fasting.

Zimmermann et al. (2004) reported that an enzyme besides
hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL; 151750) that they called 'adipose
triglyceride lipase (ATGL)' catalyzes the initial step in triglyceride
hydrolysis in mammalian adipose tissue. ATGL contains a 'patatin domain'
common to plant acyl-hydrolases. ATGL is highly expressed in adipose
tissue of mice and humans. It exhibits high substrate specificity for
triacylglycerol and is associated with lipid droplets. Inhibition of
ATGL markedly decreased total adipose acyl-hydrolase activity. Thus,
Zimmermann et al. (2004) concluded that ATGL and hormone-sensitive
lipase coordinately catabolize stored triglycerides in adipose tissue of
mammals.

Jenkins et al. (2004) found that purified recombinant PNPLA3 (609567),
PNPLA2, and GS2 (PNPLA4; 300102) expressed in insect cells showed
abundant triacylglycerol lipase activity. The recombinant enzymes also
showed acylglycerol transacylase activity by transferring the acyl donor
mono-olein to mono-olein or diolein acceptors to form diolein and
triolein, respectively.

Using a cell culture model and various biochemical approaches, Wang et
al. (2011) investigated the mechanisms by which perilipin-1 (PLIN1;
170290), PLIN2 (103195), and PLIN5 (613248) control lipolysis by ATGL
and its colipase, CGI58 (ABHD5; 604780). PLIN5 exerted a negative
regulatory role in lipid droplet hydrolysis by binding and inhibiting
ATGL activity at the lipid droplet surface under basal conditions. Even
after protein kinase A (PKA; see 188830) activation, release of fatty
acid was only modestly increased. In contrast, recruitment of CGI58,
followed by interaction with ATGL, increased lipolysis. Neither PLIN1
nor PLIN2 directly interacted with ATGL. Wang et al. (2011) proposed
that PLIN5 plays a critical role in oxidative tissues (e.g., heart and
skeletal muscle) to protect mitochondria from a rapid increase of fatty
acid during lipolysis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Fischer et al. (2007) reported that the PNPLA2 gene comprises 9 coding
exons.

MAPPING

The Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PNPLA2 gene to
chromosome 11 (TMAP A009K14). Villena et al. (2004) mapped the mouse
Pnpla2 gene to chromosome 7.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 patients with a neutral lipids storage disorder (NLSD) associated
with mild myopathy but not ichthyosis (NLSDM; 610717), Fischer et al.
(2007) detected mutations in the PNPLA2 gene. One individual was a
compound heterozygote for a 1-bp deletion (808delC; 609059.0001) and a
missense mutation (P195L; 609059.0002). The second was homozygous for a
1-bp deletion (847delC; 609059.0003). The third was homozygous for a
nonsense mutation (Q289X; 609059.0004). Fischer et al. (2007) considered
the PNPLA2 gene as a good candidate for mutations causing this disorder
because PNPLA2 is activated by ABHD5 (604780), mutations in which cause
another NLSD, that with ichthyosis (NLSDI), also called Chanarin-Dorfman
syndrome (CDS; 275630). Fischer et al. (2007) noted that the 808delC,
847delC, and Q289X mutations severely alter and delete the C-terminal
region of the protein, which includes the putative lipid-binding site.
They suggested that loss of the C-terminal region could explain the low
activity of the lipid droplet-associated lipase and the defect in
triglyceride catabolism, while the intact N-terminal region containing
the catalytic site may retain lipase activity, explaining the normal in
vitro lipase activity in whole lysate of fibroblasts.

Reilich et al. (2011) identified biallelic mutations in the PNPLA2 gene
(see, e.g., 609059.0002; 609059.0009-609059.0010) in 6 patients,
including 2 sibs, with NLSDM. Mutations in 5 of the patients resulted in
a lack of protein expression. The patients had adult onset of muscle
weakness affecting primarily the shoulder girdle but sometimes affecting
the lower limbs and distal muscles of the fingers and feet. Some
patients developed cardiac involvement later in the disease course. All
had increased serum creatine kinase, most had increased serum
triglycerides, and all had Jordans bodies on peripheral blood smear,
consistent with multisystem lipid accumulation. Other, more variable
features included diabetes, hepatic steatosis, and sensorineural hearing
loss. Activation of hormone-sensitive lipase by beta-adrenergic agents
such as clenbuterol appeared to bypass the enzymatic block in
PNPLA2-deficient patient cells in vitro, suggesting a possible
therapeutic approach.

In 3 unrelated Han Chinese patients with adult-onset neutral lipid
storage disease with myopathy, Lin et al. (2012) identified 4 different
mutations in the PNPLA2 gene (609059.0005-609059.0008). All mutations
occurred in the homozygous or compound heterozygous state.

ANIMAL MODEL

Das et al. (2011) showed that inhibition of lipolysis through genetic
ablation of Atgl or hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL; 151750) ameliorated
certain features of cancer-associated cachexia. In wildtype C57BL/6
mice, the injection of Lewis lung carcinoma or B16 melanoma cells causes
tumor growth, loss of white adipose tissue, and a marked reduction of
gastrocnemius muscle. In contrast, Atgl-deficient mice with tumors
resisted increased white adipose tissue lipolysis, myocyte apoptosis,
and proteasomal muscle degradation and maintained normal adipose and
gastrocnemius muscle mass. Hsl-deficient mice with tumors were also
protected, although to a lesser degree. Das et al. (2011) concluded that
functional lipolysis is essential in the pathogenesis of
cancer-associated cachexia.

Haemmerle et al. (2011) found that Atgl knockout in mice resulted in
cardiac insufficiency and premature death. Cardiac dysfunction was
associated with excessive lipid and glycogen accumulation, disrupted
substrate oxidation and respiration in predominantly subsarcolemmal
mitochondria, reduced expression of Ppar-alpha (PPARA; 170998) and
Ppar-delta (PPARD; 600409) target genes, including genes directly
involved in fatty acid and glucose metabolism, and reduced expression of
Pgc1-alpha (PPARGC1A; 604517) and Pgc1-beta (PPARGC1B; 608886).
Atgl-null mice also showed defective expression of Ppar-alpha and
Ppar-delta target genes in liver, but decreased expression of Pgc1-alpha
and Pgc1-beta was specific to cardiac muscle. Conditional Atgl deletion
in heart and skeletal muscle only resulted in a cardiac phenotype
identical to that in Atgl -/- mice. Reexpression of an Atgl transgene in
hearts of Atgl -/- mice entirely rescued the lethal cardiac phenotype,
increased expression of Ppar-alpha and Ppar-delta target genes and
Pgc1-alpha and Pgc1-beta, restored the metabolic profile, and increased
life span to a level indistinguishable from wildtype. Treatment of Atgl
-/- mice with Ppar-alpha agonists, but not Ppar-delta agonists,
completely reversed all pathologic effects of Atgl deletion. Haemmerle
et al. (2011) concluded that ATGL is required for cardiac mitochondrial
function and activation of lipids as signaling molecules.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
NEUTRAL LIPID STORAGE DISEASE WITH MYOPATHY
PNPLA2, 1-BP DEL, 808C

In a female from the Netherlands with neutral lipid storage disease with
myopathy (NLSDM; 610717), Fischer et al. (2007) detected compound
heterozygosity for mutations in the PNPLA2 gene. A 1-bp deletion in exon
7 (808delC) led to frameshift and a premature stop codon at amino acid
position 319. The other allele carried a missense mutation
(609059.0002).

.0002
NEUTRAL LIPID STORAGE DISEASE WITH MYOPATHY
PNPLA2, PRO195LEU

The patient of Fischer et al. (2007) from the Netherlands with neutral
lipid storage disease with myopathy (NLSDM; 610717) carried a 584C-T
transition in exon 5 of the PNPLA2 gene that led to a pro195-to-leu
substitution (P195L). This mutation is localized on the border of the
N-terminal patatin domain in a region that is conserved in 5 proteins of
the PNPLA family and in homologous genes conserved in bilateral animals.
The other allele of the patient carried a 1-bp deletion (609059.0001).

Reilich et al. (2011) reported a 45-year-old woman from Newfoundland
with NLSDM and a homozygous P195L mutation in the PNPLA2 gene. She had
onset of slowly progressive myopathy in her twenties, followed by severe
congestive heart failure and cardiomyopathy by her late thirties. She
also developed diabetes mellitus. The proximal muscles were more
severely affected. Her father died of dilated cardiomyopathy at age 57.
The proband also carried a homozygous G483R substitution in the PNPLA2
gene, which was of uncertain significance.

.0003
NEUTRAL LIPID STORAGE DISEASE WITH MYOPATHY
PNPLA2, 1-BP DEL, 847C

In a French patient with neutral lipid storage disease with myopathy
(NLSDM; 610717), Fischer et al. (2007) detected homozygosity for a 1-bp
deletion in exon 7 of the PNPLA2 gene, 847delC, leading to frameshift
and a premature stop codon at amino acid position 319. This patient
developed diabetes at age 12 and died from cardiovascular complications
at age 34.

.0004
NEUTRAL LIPID STORAGE DISEASE WITH MYOPATHY
PNPLA2, GLN289TER

In an Algerian patient with neutral lipid storage disease with myopathy
(NLSDM; 610717), Fischer et al. (2007) found homozygosity for an 865C-T
transition in exon 7 of the PNPLA2 gene that substituted a stop codon
for the glutamine at codon 289 (Q289X).

.0005
NEUTRAL LIPID STORAGE DISEASE WITH MYOPATHY
PNPLA2, IVS6DS, T-C, +2

In a 44-year-old Han Chinese man with adult-onset NLSDM (610717), Lin et
al. (2012) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
PNPLA2 gene: a T-to-C transition in intron 6, and a 749A-C transversion
resulting in a gln250-to-pro (Q250P; 609059.0006) substitution. RT-PCR
of patient skeletal muscle detected only the Q250P mutant mRNA,
indicating that absence of the transcript results from the splice site
mutation. The Q250P mutation was not found in 50 controls.

.0006
NEUTRAL LIPID STORAGE DISEASE WITH MYOPATHY

See 609059.0005 and Lin et al. (2012).

.0007
NEUTRAL LIPID STORAGE DISEASE WITH MYOPATHY
PNPLA2, IVS6DS, G-T, +1

In a 48-year-old Han Chinese woman with adult-onset NLSDM (610717), Lin
et al. (2012) identified a homozygous G-to-T transversion in intron 6 of
the PNPLA2 gene. No PNPLA2 transcript was detected by RT-PCR analysis of
mRNA from skeletal muscle.

.0008
NEUTRAL LIPID STORAGE DISEASE WITH MYOPATHY
PNPLA2, 1-BP DEL, 467C

In a 39-year-old Han Chinese man with adult-onset NLSDM (610717), Lin et
al. (2012) identified a homozygous 1-bp deletion (467delC) in the PNPLA2
gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination
(Pro156LeufsTer100).

.0009
NEUTRAL LIPID STORAGE DISEASE WITH MYOPATHY
PNPLA2, 1-BP DUP, 613C

In 2 Turkish sibs with adult-onset NLSDM (610717), Reilich et al. (2011)
identified a homozygous 1-bp duplication (c.613dupC) in exon 5 of the
PNPLA2 gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination. The
mutant transcript was predicted to undergo nonsense-mediated mRNA decay,
resulting in a lack of protein. Muscle weakness primarily affected the
proximal upper limbs, although both patients also had some distal
involvement, including of the lower limbs in 1. Serum creatine kinase
and triglycerides were increased. Both patients had hepatic steatosis,
but neither had cardiac involvement. Jordans bodies were present in
peripheral blood.

.0010
NEUTRAL LIPID STORAGE DISEASE WITH MYOPATHY
PNPLA2, 1-BP DEL, 543C

In a British man with adult-onset NLSDM (610717), Reilich et al. (2011)
identified a homozygous 1-bp deletion (c.543delC) in exon 5 of the
PNPLA2 gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination. The
mutant transcript was predicted to undergo nonsense-mediated mRNA decay,
resulting in a lack of protein. At age 28 years, the patient developed
slowly progressive muscle weakness affecting the proximal upper and
lower limbs. At age 52 years, he had Gowers sign, distal muscle weakness
of the upper and lower extremities, and cardiac involvement. He also had
sensorineural hearing loss since childhood. Jordans bodies were present
in peripheral blood.

.0011
NEUTRAL LIPID STORAGE DISEASE WITH MYOPATHY
PNPLA2, 4-BP DUP, 475CTCC

In a 35-year-old Japanese woman with NLSDM (610717), Akiyama et al.
(2007) identified a homozygous 4-bp duplication (c.475_478dupCTCC) in
exon 4 of the PNPLA2 gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature
termination in the patatin domain (Gln160ProfsTer19). The mutation was
not found in 100 control alleles or in 50 unrelated Japanese
individuals. She had delayed walking and slow running from childhood,
with severe upper and lower limb involvement as an adult. However, she
did not have cardiac involvement. Imaging showed fatty replacement of
multiple skeletal muscles, and skeletal muscle biopsy showed
accumulation of neutral lipid droplets.

615178	TITLE *615178 KXDL MOTIF-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; KXD1
;;CHROMOSOME 19 OPEN READING FRAME 50; C19ORF50
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Based on experiments in mice and Drosophila, KXD1 is predicted to have a
role in biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles (Yang et al., 2012).

CLONING

By database analysis, Yang et al. (2012) identified human KXD1 and 2
splice variants of mouse Kxd1, which they termed Kxd1a and Kxd1b. The
deduced 177-amino acid mouse Kxd1a protein has a calculated molecular
mass of 20 kD and shares 93% amino acid identity with human KXD1. Kxd1a
is predicted to have 2 coiled-coil regions, the second of which contains
the KxDL motif. Kxd1b encodes a deduced 219-amino acid protein with an
N-terminal extension compared with Kxd1a. Western blot analysis detected
a single Kxdl1 protein that was expressed at variable levels in all
mouse tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Using protein interaction assays, Yang et al. (2012) showed that mouse
Kxd1 interacted with BLOS1 (BLOC1S1; 601444) and all other subunits of
biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex-1 (BLOC1) examined.
Knockdown of BLOS1 in HeLa cells via small interfering RNA reduced KXD1
protein content.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the KXD1 gene to chromosome 19p13.11 based on an
alignment of the KXD1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK098346) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

ANIMAL MODEL

Yang et al. (2012) found that Kxd1 -/- mice had a mild phenotype that
included reduction in dense granule content in platelets and
malformation of melanosomes in retinal pigment epithelia. The retinal
defect was associated with significantly reduced eumelanin content.
Knockout of Kxd1 reduced the steady-state level of Blos1, whereas the
levels of the BLOC1 subunits dysbindin (DTNBP1; 607145) and pallidin
(BLOC1S6; 604310) were unaffected. Likewise, Kxd1 content was not
altered in the BLOC1 mouse mutants sandy (DTNBP1), muted (BLOC1S5;
607289), and pallid (BLOC1S6).

;;SMALL INDUCIBLE CYTOKINE SUBFAMILY A, MEMBER 24; SCYA24;;
MYELOID PROGENITOR INHIBITORY FACTOR 2; MPIF2;;
EOTAXIN 2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chemokines are a family of small cytokines that stimulate
proinflammatory activity by attracting leukocytes. Beta-chemokines are
characterized by a C-C motif (2 contiguous cysteines). Patel et al.
(1997) identified 2 beta-chemokines by searching ESTs for conserved
beta-chemokine motifs, and designated them MPIF1 (602494) and MPIF2.
MPIF2 encodes a predicted 119-amino acid protein containing a 26-amino
acid N-terminal signal peptide. The MPIF2 protein, which migrates as a
10.5-kD band on SDS-PAGE, is most closely related to that of MCP3 (39%
identity; 158106) and MIP-1-alpha (42% identity; 182283). MPIF2
expression was undetectable on Northern blots, but was found by RT-PCR
in activated monocytes and T lymphocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

Patel et al. (1997) found that MPIF2 had chemotactic activity on resting
T lymphocytes and lower activity on neutrophils. MPIF2 was a strong
suppressor of colony formation by a multipotential hematopoietic
progenitor cell line.

Menzies-Gow et al. (2002) used immunohistological analysis to examined
the effects of intradermal injection of eotaxin (CCL11; 601156) and
eotaxin-2, both of which act through CCR3 (601268), into human atopic
and nonatopic skin. Both chemokines produced a dose- and time-dependent
local eosinophilia of comparable intensity and an acute wheal and flare
response regardless of atopy status. Basophils and neutrophils also
accumulated at the injection sites. Menzies-Gow et al. (2002) concluded
that the eosinophilic and inflammatory cell infiltrate induced by
eotaxins is consistent with CC chemokine-induced mast cell
degranulation.

MAPPING

By use of PCR analysis of somatic cell hybrid DNAs, radiation hybrid
mapping, and a chromosome 7-specific YAC library, Nomiyama et al. (1998)
mapped the SCYA24 gene to chromosome 7q11.23.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The eotaxin gene family (eotaxin 1; eotaxin 2; and eotaxin 3, 604697)
recruits and activates CCR3-bearing cells such as eosinophils, mast
cells, and Th2 lymphocytes that play a major role in allergic disorders.
Shin et al. (2003) genotyped a 721-member asthma (600807) cohort at 17
polymorphisms among the 3 eotaxin loci. Statistical analysis revealed
that the eotaxin 2 +1272A-G G* allele showed significantly lower
frequency in asthmatics than in normal healthy controls (0.14 versus
0.23, P=0.002), and that distribution of the eotaxin 2 +1272A-G G*
allele-containing genotypes was also much lower in asthmatics (26.3
versus 40.8%, P = 0.003). In addition, a nonsynonymous single-nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) in eotaxin 1, +123Ala to Thr, showed significant
association with total serum IgE levels (P = 0.002-0.02) (see 147050).
The effect of eotaxin 1 +123Ala to Thr on total serum IgE appeared in a
gene dose-dependent manner. The authors suggested that the development
of asthma may be associated with eotaxin 2 +1272A-G polymorphisms, and
the susceptibility to high IgE production may be attributed to the
eotaxin 1 +123Ala to Thr polymorphism. In an erratum, the authors noted
that the first base of the translation start site of the eotaxin 2
genomic reference sequence had been denoted as +1, introducing some
errors in the numbering of the eotaxin 2 SNPs.

Min et al. (2005) found that plasma eotaxin-2 levels were increased in
asthmatics compared to healthy controls, and that the increased levels
were proportional to the number of 1272A-G alleles. Min et al. (2005)
suggested that plasma eotaxin-2 may have a protective effect against the
development of asthma via desensitization.

MICRO RNA 409-3p, INCLUDED; MIR409-3p, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding RNA molecules of about 22 nucleotides
that play important roles in gene regulation. The MIR409 precursor
stem-loop sequence encodes 2 mature miRNAs, MIR409-5p and MIR409-3p,
from its 5-prime and 3-prime ends, respectively (Altuvia et al., 2005).

CLONING

By database and sequence analysis, Altuvia et al. (2005) identified
MIR409-5p and MIR409-3p, which lie on the 5-prime and 3-prime ends,
respectively, of the MIR409 precursor stem-loop structure. They cloned
MIR409-5p from a pituitary gland cDNA library and MIR409-3p from a
neuroblastoma cDNA library.

GENE FUNCTION

By screening an miRNA library, Fort et al. (2010) identified MIR409-3p
among a small group of miRNAs that reduced production of fibrinogen (see
FGB; 134830) in HuH7 human hepatoma cells. Luciferase assays showed that
MIR409-3p specifically lowered FGB mRNA levels via a target site in the
FGB mRNA 3-prime UTR.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Altuvia et al. (2005) mapped the MIR409
gene within a miRNA cluster on chromosome 14 that includes MIR369
(611794).

Gross (2011) mapped the MIR409 gene to chromosome 14q32.31 based on an
alignment of the MIR409 stem-loop sequence
(UGGUACUCGGGGAGAGGUUACCCGAGCAACUUUGCAUCUGGACGACGAAUGUUGCUCGGUGAACCCCUUUUCGGUAUCA)
with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;POLARITY-OSMOTIC DEFECTIVE 1, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF; POD1;;
CRN7
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Coronins, such as CORO7, constitute an evolutionarily conserved family
of WD-repeat actin-binding proteins. CORO7 plays a role in Golgi complex
morphology and function (Rybakin et al., 2004, 2006).

CLONING

By EST database analysis, followed by RT-PCR of human liver carcinoma
cDNA, Rybakin et al. (2004) cloned CORO7, which they called CRN7. The
deduced 924-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 100.5
kD, which was confirmed experimentally. CORO7 contains 2 coronin WD
repeat-containing domains with a proline-, serine-, and
threonine-enriched region (PST motif) preceding the second WD-repeat.
CORO7 shares 30% and 29% amino acid identity with Drosophila Pod1 and C.
elegans Pod1, respectively. Northern blot analysis detected expression
in mouse embryos as early as day 5 postcoitum and expression increased
through day 15. Coro7 expression was detected in most mouse tissues
examined with high levels in brain, thymus, and kidney and low levels in
heart, liver, testis, and muscle. Western blot analysis of mouse tissues
showed a similar distribution of Coro7 with low expression in skeletal
and heart muscle. Immunofluorescence studies detected developmental
expression of mouse Coro7 in embryonic brain, thymus, intestine, skin,
and eye. Indirect immunofluorescence studies detected Coro7 in
vesicle-like structures and in a Golgi-like perinuclear compartment in
mouse fibroblasts. Sucrose gradient centrifugation and
immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that Coro7 localized to
cytosolic vesicles and to the cis-Golgi region. The membrane-associated
form of Coro7 was tyrosine-phosphorylated, whereas the cytosolic form
was not.

GENE FUNCTION

By electron microscopy, Rybakin et al. (2006) showed that siRNA
knockdown of CORO7 in HeLa cells caused loss of Golgi integrity and
membrane scattering. CORO7 knockdown caused a defect in Golgi export of
vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG) but did not alter protein
import into the trans-Golgi network. Golgi cargo glycosylation was not
affected. Using in vitro binding, coimmunoprecipitation, and
colocalization studies, the authors demonstrated that CORO7 interacted
with clathrin adaptor AP1 (see 600157) and that this interaction takes
place at Golgi membranes. Rybakin et al. (2006) showed that CORO7 was
not required for AP1 targeting to Golgi membranes and suggested that
CORO7 acts downstream of AP1 recruitment.

603214	TITLE *603214 ATP-BINDING CASSETTE, SUBFAMILY D, MEMBER 4; ABCD4
;;PEROXISOMAL MEMBRANE PROTEIN 1-LIKE; PXMP1L;;
P70R;;
PMP69
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ABCD4 gene encodes a protein with several transmembrane domains and
ATPase function. There is a cytosolic nucleotide (ATP)-binding domain
with highly conserved motifs at the C terminus. The protein is involved
in the intracellular processing of cobalamin (vitamin B12) (summary by
Coelho et al., 2012).

CLONING

The peroxisomal membrane contains several ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
transporters, including PMP70 (ABCD3; 170995), ALDP (ABCD1; 300371), and
ALDR (ABCD2; 601081). All 3 proteins are ABC half-transporters, which
dimerize to form an active transporter. See 603076. By searching an EST
database for homologs of PMP70 and ALDP, Shani et al. (1997) and
Holzinger et al. (1997) identified PXMP1L cDNAs. They respectively
designated the gene P70R and PMP69. Shani et al. (1997) reported that
the predicted 606-amino acid protein has the structure of an ABC
half-transporter and shares 25 to 27% sequence identity with PMP70,
ALDR, and ALDP. Antibodies against PXMP1L detected a 73-kD protein on
Western blots. Immunofluorescence studies localized the protein to
peroxisomes. Northern blot analysis revealed that PXMP1L was expressed
as a 2.6-kb mRNA in all tissues examined. Holzinger et al. (1997) and
Holzinger et al. (1998) found transcript variants resulting from
alternative splicing and use of alternative polyadenylation sites.

GENE STRUCTURE

Holzinger et al. (1998) reported that the PXMP1L gene contains 19 exons
and spans approximately 16 kb.

MAPPING

By analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel and by identity with mapped
clones, Shani et al. (1997) mapped the PXMP1L gene to 14q24. Holzinger
et al. (1998) confirmed this localization by fluorescence in situ
hybridization. They noted that part of a PXMP1L cDNA was included in a
cosmid derived from chromosome 14q24.3.

GENE FUNCTION

Coelho et al. (2012) demonstrated that ABCD4 colocalized with the
lysosomal proteins LAMP1 (153330) and LMBRD1 (612625), the latter of
which is deficient in methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria, type
cblF (277380). Cellular studies with mutant ABCD4 alleles indicated that
the ATPase domain of ABCD4 may be involved in the intracellular
processing of vitamin B12 (cobalamin). The biochemical findings and
localization studies suggested that ABCD4 is involved in the lysosomal
release of cbl into the cytoplasm. Although ABCD4 was initially thought
to be a peroxisomal protein, Coelho et al. (2012) provided evidence
against the involvement of peroxisomes in cbl metabolism.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Childhood cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (CCER), adrenomyeloneuropathy
(AMN), and AMN with cerebral demyelination are the main phenotypic
variants of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD; 300100), which is caused
by mutation in the ABCD1 gene (300371). The biochemical hallmark of ALD
is the accumulation of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) in plasma and
tissues. Asheuer et al. (2005) studied the expression of the ABCD1,
ABCD2, ABCD3 (170995), and ABCD4 genes and 2 VLCFA synthetase genes,
VLCS (SLC27A2; 603247) and BG1 (ACSBG1; 614362), in fibroblasts and
brains from normal controls and ALD patients with the 3 main phenotypes,
and they studied VLCFA concentrations in normal-appearing white matter
from ALD patients with the 3 main phenotypes. The authors showed that
ABCD1-truncating mutations were unlikely to cause variation in the ALD
phenotype. Accumulation of saturated VLCFA in normal-appearing white
matter correlated with ALD phenotype. Expression of ABCD4 and BG1, but
not of the ABCD2, ABCD3, and VLCS genes, tended to correlate with the
severity of the disease, acting early in the pathogenesis of ALD.

In 2 unrelated children with methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria
type cblJ (614857), Coelho et al. (2012) identified 4 different
mutations in the ABCD4 gene (603214.0001-603214.0004) in compound
heterozygous state. The mutations, which were found using
microcell-mediated chromosome transfer and exome sequencing, resulted in
a loss of function. The patients presented soon after birth with
hypotonia, respiratory distress, and evidence of bone marrow failure.
One child had mild dysmorphic features, cardiac abnormalities, and
delayed psychomotor development. Biochemical studies confirmed a defect
in cobalamin metabolism and were similar to abnormalities observed in
patients with cblF (277380). Patient cell lines showed no rescue of the
defect when transfected with LMBRD1, suggesting that these 2 genes
function in the same pathway.

In a North American child with methylmalonic aciduria and
homocystinuria, complementation group J (cblJ; 614857), Coelho et al.
(2012) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the ABCD4
gene: a 956A-G transition resulting in a tyr319-to-cys (Y319C)
substitution in the last transmembrane domain, and a 2-bp insertion
(1746insCT; 603214.0001), resulting in a frameshift and premature
termination (Glu583LeufsTer9) leading to the removal of 14 residues from
the C terminus in the predicted cytosolic nucleotide binding domain. The
mutations were identified by exome sequencing and confirmed by Sanger
sequencing. Each unaffected parent was heterozygous for 1 of the
mutations. Neither mutation was found in the 1000 Genomes Project data
set. Expression of wildtype ABCD4 in patient fibroblasts led to rescue
of the biochemical phenotype.

compound heterozygosity for 2 splice site mutations in the ABCD4 gene: a
G-T transversion in intron 5 (542+1G-T), resulting in the skipping of
exon 5 (D143_S181del), which encodes 1 of the transmembrane domains, and
a 1456G-T transversion at the last nucleotide in exon 14, resulting in
the skipping of exons 13 and 14 (G443_S485del; 603214.0004) in the
cytosolic nucleotide binding domain. The mutations were identified by
microcell-mediated chromosome transfer and exome sequencing. Neither
mutation was found in the 1000 Genomes Project data set. Expression of
wildtype ABCD4 in patient fibroblasts led to rescue of the biochemical
phenotype.

;;AN1-TYPE ZINC FINGER DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2B;;
ARSENITE-INDUCIBLE RNA-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN-LIKE PROTEIN; AIRAPL;;
AIRAP-LIKE PROTEIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Yun et al. (2008) cloned mouse Zfand2b, which they called Airapl. The
deduced 257-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal AN1-type zinc
finger, followed by 2 ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs) and a
C-terminal CAAX box for protein prenylation. The C-terminal domain of
Airapl also has 3 p38 MAP kinase (MAPK14; 600289) phosphorylation sites.
Airapl and Airap (ZFAND2A; 610699) share 60% identity in their
N-terminal ends, but their C termini differ. EST database analysis
detected broad AIRAPL expression in human and mouse tissues.
Immunohistochemical analysis showed that mouse Airapl was expressed in
the endoplasmic reticulum of transfected COS-1 cells, and this
localization required the C-terminal prenylation motif.

GENE FUNCTION

Yun et al. (2008) found that membrane-bound Airapl associated with
proteasomes following sodium arsenite-induced cell stress in mouse
fibroblasts. Cytosolic Airap associated with proteasomes several hours
after Airapl. Binding of Airap and Airapl to proteasomes enhanced the
ability of proteasomes to digest a small peptide substrate. Domain
swapping between Airap and Airapl revealed that the C-terminal domain of
Airapl directed arsenite-regulated proteasome complex formation. This
C-terminal domain of Airapl was phosphorylated by p38 MAP kinase, but
this phosphorylation did not alter arsenite-regulated proteasome
association. C. elegans contains a single AIRAP ortholog, Aip1, and
worms depleted of Aip1 were hypersensitive to arsenite- and unfolded
protein-induced stress and showed reduced life span. Yun et al. (2008)
concluded that AIRAP and AIRAPL enhance proteasome function during cell
stress.

Hassan et al. (2009) used a transgenic C. elegans Alzheimer disease (AD;
104300) model to identify cellular responses to proteotoxicity resulting
from expression of the human beta-amyloid peptide (APP; 104760).
Arsenite-inducible protein-1 (Aip1) was upregulated in A-beta-expressing
animals. Overexpression of Aip1 protected against, while RNAi knockdown
of Aip1 exacerbated, A-beta toxicity. Aip1 overexpression also reduced
accumulation of A-beta in this model, which is consistent with Aip1
enhancing protein degradation. Transgenic expression of human Aip1
homologs AIRAPL, but not AIRAP, suppressed A-beta toxicity in C.
elegans. The Aip1 farnesylation site (which is absent from AIRAP) is
essential for an Aip1 prolongevity function, and an Aip1 mutant lacking
the predicted farnesylation site failed to protect against A-beta
toxicity. Hassan et al. (2009) proposed that Aip1 may play a role in the
regulation of protein turnover and protection against A-beta toxicity
and suggested that AIRAPL may be the functional mammalian homolog of C.
elegans Aip1.

MAPPING

Hartz (2010) mapped the ZFAND2B gene to chromosome 2q35 based on an
alignment of the ZFAND2B sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC018415) with the

604420	TITLE *604420 HEMATOPOIETICALLY EXPRESSED HOMEOBOX; HHEX
;;PRHX; PRH
DESCRIPTION Homeobox-containing genes are a large family of transcription factors
that are distinguished by a 60-amino acid evolutionarily conserved
DNA-binding homeodomain. See 142950 for additional background
information on homeobox genes.

CLONING

By PCR using oligonucleotide primers based on the chicken Prh sequence,
Crompton et al. (1992) isolated a partial human promyelocytic leukemia
cell line cDNA encoding HHEX (hematopoietically expressed homeobox),
which the authors termed Prh, for proline-rich homeobox. They isolated a
full-length HHEX cDNA by screening a human acute myelogenous leukemia
cell line cDNA library. HHEX encodes a 270-amino acid protein that shows
75% sequence identity with the chicken protein and 97% identity with it
in the homeodomain, where there are 2 consecutive proline residues.
Northern blot analysis revealed expression of HHEX mRNA as a 1.7-kb
transcript in myeloid cell lines but not in lymphoid cell lines or
peripheral blood lymphocytes. Among nonhematopoietic cells, HHEX was
found in liver cells but not in fibroblasts, placenta, or HeLa cells.

Bedford et al. (1993) cloned an HHEX cDNA, which they termed HEX, from
human hematopoietic tissue by PCR using degenerate primers derived from
conserved regions of the homeodomain. The sequence of the HEX
homeodomain is 98% identical to that of the mouse and shows 55% homology
with that of human HOX11 (186770), another homeobox-containing
hematopoietic gene. The authors detected HEX as a 1.9-kb transcript in
normal human B cells and in most B-cell lines but not in normal T cells
or in most T-cell lines.

MAPPING

Using somatic cell hybrid analysis, Hromas et al. (1993) mapped the HHEX
gene to chromosome 10, where the HOX11 gene is located. By FISH,
Morgutti et al. (2001) mapped the HHEX gene to chromosome 10q24.

GENE STRUCTURE

Morgutti et al. (2001) determined that the HHEX gene contains 4 exons
and spans 5.7 kb of genomic DNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Tanaka et al. (1999) found that rat HHEX functions as a transcriptional
repressor in liver cells and may be involved in the differentiation
and/or maintenance of the differentiated state in hepatocytes.

The divergent homeobox gene HEX is expressed in the anterior visceral
endoderm during early mouse development and in some adult tissues of
endodermal origin, including liver and thyroid. D'Elia et al. (2002)
analyzed HEX expression and subcellular localization in a series of 55
human thyroid tumors and in several tumor cell lines. HEX mRNA was
detected by RT-PCR either in normal tissues or in thyroid adenomas and
differentiated (papillary and follicular) carcinomas. HEX mRNA was also
expressed in most undifferentiated carcinomas. In normal tissues and
adenomas, HEX protein was present both in nucleus and cytoplasm. In
contrast, both differentiated and undifferentiated carcinomas, as well
as the tumor cell lines investigated, showed HEX protein only in the
cytoplasm. These findings suggested that regulation of HEX entry in the
nucleus of thyrocytes may represent a critical step during human thyroid
tumorigenesis.

Donaldson et al. (2005) developed computational tools for the
identification of gene regulatory sequences functionally related to the
stem cell enhancer, SCL (TAL1; 187040). Two candidate enhancers
discovered in this way were located in intron 1 of the FLI1 (193067) and
HHEX genes, both transcription factors previously implicated in
controlling blood and endothelial development. Transgenic and
biochemical analyses demonstrated that the 2 enhancers are functionally
related to the SCL stem cell enhancer.

Foley and Mercola (2005) presented evidence suggesting that HHEX has a
role in fetal cardiac development.

Using binding studies and reporter gene assays, Oram et al. (2010) found
that ERG (165080) and FLI1 bound and activated the intermediate promoter
of the LMO2 gene (180385) in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL)
samples. LMO2 also bound enhancers in the FLI1 and ERG loci, and all 3
proteins bound an enhancer element in the first intron of the
hematopoietically expressed HHEX gene and upregulated expression of an
HHEX reporter gene. Oram et al. (2010) proposed that a self-sustaining
triad of LMO2, ERG, and FLI1 are involved in T-ALL by stabilizing HHEX
expression.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

type 2 diabetes, see 125853.

ANIMAL MODEL

Paz et al. (2010) stated that Hhex knockout in mice is embryonic lethal,
with impaired forebrain, liver, and thyroid development. Using a mouse
embryonic stem (ES) cell coculture system, in which ES cells could
differentiate into Cd41 (see 607759)-positive and Cd45 (PTPRC;
151460)-positive hematopoietic progenitors in vitro, Paz et al. (2010)
found that Hhex -/- ES cells accumulated as Cd41-positive and
Cd41-positive/Kit (164920)-positive hematopoietic progenitors with
reduced ability to develop into mature Cd45-positive hematopoietic
cells. These Cd41-positive/Kit-positive progenitors showed reduced
proliferation due to accumulation at the G2 phase of the cell cycle.
Loss of Hhex expression lead to delayed hemangioblast development and
reduced capacity to form mature Cd45-positive progenitor cells. Those
Hhex -/- ES cells able to mature into Cd45-positive cells were able to
differentiate into more committed B and myeloid lineages.

602074	TITLE *602074 DEATH-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 3; DAP3
;;MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN S29; MRPS29
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Kissil et al. (1995) cloned DAP3. DAP3 is transcribed into a 1.7-kb mRNA
and encodes a 46-kD protein carrying a potential nucleotide-binding
motif.

By proteolytic digestion of whole bovine 28S subunits, followed by
peptide analysis and EST database analysis, Koc et al. (2001) identified
full-length human DAP3, which they called MRPS29. The deduced 397-amino
acid MRPS29 protein has a calculated molecular mass of 45.6 kD. Removal
of a predicted 16-amino acid N-terminal mitochondrial localization
signal results in a mature 43.6-kD protein. Koc et al. (2001) identified
MRPS29 orthologs in mouse, Drosophila, C. elegans, and yeast, but not in
E. coli. Mouse and human MRPS29 share 81.8% amino acid identity.

GENE FUNCTION

Kissil et al. (1995) found that DAP3 was involved in mediating
interferon-gamma (147570)-induced cell death. Several lines of evidence
suggested that suppression of cell death is a critical step in the
multistage process of tumorigenesis. Kissil et al. (1995) concluded that
DAP3, being a positive mediator of cell death, may be a tumor suppressor
gene subject to loss or inactivation in tumors.

MAPPING

Kissil and Kimchi (1997) mapped the DAP3 gene to chromosome 1q21 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. Verification of the assignment was
achieved by identifying the gene in a YAC contig encompassing chromosome
1q21.1-q21.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Hirota et al. (2004) found a strong association between bronchial asthma
(600807) in adults and SNPs in the DAP3 gene (p = 0.0051; OR = 1.87; 95%
CI = 1.20-2.92), but no association with childhood asthma. The tendency
was more prominent in patients with high serum total immunoglobulin E
(IgE; 147180). DAP3 was found to be expressed in normal bronchial
epithelial cells, and that expression was induced by IFNG.

609768	TITLE *609768 BIOGENESIS OF LYSOSOME-RELATED ORGANELLES COMPLEX 1, SUBUNIT 2; BLOC1S2
;;BLOC1, SUBUNIT 2; BLOS2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

BLOC1S2 is a component of the ubiquitously expressed BLOC1 multisubunit
protein complex. BLOC1 is required for normal biogenesis of specialized
organelles of the endosomal-lysosomal system, such as melanosomes and
platelet dense granules (Starcevic and Dell'Angelica, 2004).

CLONING

Using the BLOC1 subunit pallidin (PLDN; 604310) as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Starcevic and Dell'Angelica
(2004) cloned BLOC1S2, which they called BLOS2. The deduced BLOS2
protein contains coiled-coil regions and has a calculated molecular mass
of 16 kD. Western blot analysis detected endogenous HeLa cell BLOS2 at
an apparent molecular mass of 18 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

By mass spectrometry of BLOC1 proteins purified from bovine liver, mouse
liver, and HeLa cells, Starcevic and Dell'Angelica (2004) identified
BLOS2 as a subunit of BLOC1. Other BLOC1 subunits identified were
pallidin, muted (607289), dysbindin (DTNBP1; 607145), cappuccino
(605695), snapin (SNAPAP; 607007), BLOC1S1 (601444), and BLOC1S3
(609762). Coimmunoprecipitation and yeast 2-hybrid analyses confirmed
that these proteins interact within the BLOC1 complex.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the BLOC1S2
gene to chromosome 10 (TMAP RH47426).

141251	TITLE *141251 HEME OXYGENASE 2; HMOX2
;;HEMOXYGENASE 2
DESCRIPTION 
GENE FUNCTION

Heme oxygenase is the rate-limiting enzyme in the heme degradative
pathway (Kutty et al., 1994). This degradative process has 2 important
products, biliverdin, the precursor of the bile pigment bilirubin, and
carbon monoxide, a putative neurotransmitter. There are 2 isozymic forms
of heme oxygenase, an inducible heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1; 141250) and a
constitutive heme oxygenase-2 (HMOX2).

Heme oxygenase-2, which synthesizes carbon monoxide (CO), has been
localized by immunohistochemistry to endothelial cells and adventitial
nerves of blood vessels. It is also localized to neurons in autonomic
ganglia, including the petrosal, superior cervical, and nodose ganglia,
as well as ganglia in the myenteric plexus of the intestine. Zakhary et
al. (1996) demonstrated by enzyme studies that tin protoporphyrin IX is
a selective inhibitor of heme oxygenase with about 10-fold selectivity
for heme oxygenase over endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3; 163729)
and soluble guanylyl cyclase. Inhibition of heme oxygenase activity by
tin protoporphyrin IX reverses the component of endothelial-derived
relaxation porcine distal pulmonary arteries not reversed by an
inhibitor of NOS. Thus, the authors concluded that CO, like nitric oxide
(NO), may have endothelial-derived relaxing activity; additionally, the
similarity of NOS and heme oxygenase-2 localizations and functions in
blood vessels and the autonomic nervous system implies complementary and
possibly coordinated physiologic roles for these 2 mediators.

Using immunoprecipitation studies, Takahashi et al. (2000) showed that
amyloid precursor protein (APP; 104760) and amyloid precursor-like
protein (APLP1; 104775) bound to HMOX1 and HMOX2 in the endoplasmic
reticulum and inhibited heme oxygenase activity by 25 to 35% in vitro.
Familial Alzheimer disease (AD; 104300)-associated APP mutations showed
greater inhibition (45 to 50%) of heme oxygenase. As heme oxygenase
shows antioxidative effects, the authors hypothesized that APP-mediated
inhibition of heme oxygenase may result in increased oxidative
neurotoxicity in AD.

Williams et al. (2004) demonstrated that hemoxygenase-2 is part of the
BK channel complex (600150) and enhances channel activity in normoxia.
Knockdown of hemoxygenase-2 expression reduced channel activity, and
carbon monoxide, a product of hemoxygenase-2 activity, rescued this loss
of function. Inhibition of BK channels by hypoxia was dependent on
hemoxygenase-2 expression and was augmented by hemoxygenase-2
stimulation. Furthermore, carotid body cells demonstrated
hemoxygenase-2-dependent hypoxic BK channel inhibition, which indicated
that hemoxygenase-2 is an oxygen sensor that controls channel activity
during oxygen deprivation.

MAPPING

Using the polymerase chain reaction for analysis of human/rodent somatic
cell hybrids, Kutty et al. (1994) assigned the HMOX2 gene to chromosome
16. They regionalized the assignment to 16p13.3 by fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH). By FISH, Saito-Ohara et al. (1997) mapped the
Hmox2 gene to mouse chromosome 16B1.

ANIMAL MODEL

Heme oxygenase activity leads to accumulation of the antioxidant
bilirubin, and degradation of the preoxidant heme. Moderate
overexpression of the inducible form, HMOX1, is associated with
protection against oxidative injury. To evaluate the role of HMOX2
(called HO-2 by the authors) in oxidative stress, Dennery et al. (1998)
investigated Hmox2 null 'knockout' mice exposed to more than 95% O(2)
compared with wildtype controls. Similar basal levels of lung
antioxidants were observed, except that the knockouts had a 2-fold
increase in total glutathione content. Despite increased Hmox1
expression from Hmox1 induction, knockout animals were sensitized to
hyperoxia-induced oxidative injury and mortality, and also had
significantly increased markers of oxidative injury before hyperoxic
exposure. The results suggested that Hmox2 functions to augment the
turnover of lung iron during oxidative stress, and that this function
does not appear to be compensated for by induction of Hmox1 in the
knockouts.

604472	TITLE *604472 TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR LIGAND SUPERFAMILY, MEMBER 13; TNFSF13
;;APRIL;;
TNF- AND APOL-RELATED LEUKOCYTE EXPRESSED LIGAND 2; TALL2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family of ligands play
important roles in various physiologic and pathologic processes,
including cell proliferation, differentiation, and death, and modulation
of immune responses. By screening EST databases, Hahne et al. (1998)
cloned a novel TNF cDNA, TNFSF13, which they called APRIL, for 'a
proliferation-inducing ligand.' The full-length cDNA TNFSF13 clone
encodes a 250-amino acid protein with a predicted 28-amino acid
cytoplasmic domain, a hydrophobic transmembrane region, and an
extracellular domain of 201 amino acids with no signal peptide. There is
only 1 N-linked glycosylation site. The sequence of the extracellular
domain shows 21% homology with TNFSF6 (134638) and 20% homology with
TNFA (191160). Northern blot analysis revealed weak expression
restricted to a few tissues: transcripts of 2.1 and 2.4 kb in prostate
and a transcript of 1.8 kb in peripheral blood leukocytes. All tumor
cell lines, however, strongly expressed the TNFSF13 2.1-kb transcript,
and expression of extracellular or full-length TNFSF13 led to increased
proliferation of various cell lines.

Shu et al. (1999) identified the same gene, which they designated TALL2.
TALL2 shares about 35% sequence identity with TALL1 (BLYS, or TNFSF13B;
603969) in the C terminus.

By RACE, RT-PCR, and screening of a T-cell cDNA library, Pradet-Balade
et al. (2002) isolated a hybrid transcript formed by intergenic splicing
of exons 1 through 6 of TWEAK (TNFSF12; 602695) to exons 2 through 6 of
APRIL. See 602695 for further information on the protein encoded by the
TWEAK/APRIL transcript, which Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) called
TWEPRIL.

Using Northern blot analysis, Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) found that
relative expression of the 1.9-kb APRIL transcript was about 6-fold
higher than that of the 2.5-kb TWEPRIL transcript in resting T cells.
However, in activated T cells, both transcripts were expressed at
similar levels. A similar expression pattern for APRIL and TWEPRIL was
detected in CD4 (186940)-positive and CD8 (see 186910)-positive T-cell
subpopulations. TWEAK expression was similar between resting and
activated T cells. TWEAK was found predominantly in ribosome-free
fractions in both resting and activated T cells, whereas APRIL and
TWEPRIL increased their association with polyribosomes following T-cell
activation, suggesting that translational efficiency of APRIL and
TWEPRIL increases upon T-cell activation.

GENE FUNCTION

Seyler et al. (2005) analyzed synovial tissue specimens from 72 patients
with rheumatoid arthritis (180300) for TNFSF13 and TNFSF13B production
and TNFSF13/TNFSF13B receptor expression. Synovitis with ectopic
germinal centers present had the highest levels of TNFSF13, produced
exclusively by CD83 (604534)-positive dendritic cells; TNFSF13B was
present in similar levels in all types of synovitis (with or without
germinal centers or T cell-B cell aggregates) and was produced
exclusively from CD68 (153634)-positive macrophages. In synovitis with
germinal centers, inhibiting TNFSF13 and TNFSF13B with a TACI
(TNFRSF13B; 604907):Fc fusion protein resulted in destruction of the
germinal centers and marked inhibition of IFN-gamma (147570) and Ig
transcription, whereas similar inhibition in the aggregate and diffuse
types of synovitis enhanced IFN-gamma production and did not affect Ig
levels. These differential immunomodulatory effects correlated with the
presence of TACI-positive T cells in aggregate and diffuse synovitis and
their absence in synovitis with germinal centers. Seyler et al. (2005)
proposed that TNFSF13 and TNFSF13B regulate B-cell as well as T-cell
function and have both pro- and antiinflammatory effects in rheumatoid
arthritis.

Both BLYS and APRIL have been described as homotrimeric molecules, a
feature common to many members of the TNF superfamily. Using ELISA
analysis, Roschke et al. (2002) found that patients with systemic lupus
erythematosus (152700), rheumatoid arthritis, Reiter syndrome, psoriatic
arthritis (see 607507), polymyositis (see 160750), and ankylosing
spondylitis (106300) had significantly higher levels of BLYS/APRIL
heterotrimers than did controls. Roschke et al. (2002) proposed that
BLYS/APRIL heterotrimers may play a role in rheumatic and other
autoimmune diseases, and that other members of the TNF ligand
superfamily may also form active soluble heterotrimers.

Using cell-based, biochemical, and structural studies, Hymowitz et al.
(2005) characterized interactions between APRIL and TACI. They found
that the short isoform of human TACI, which lacks cysteine-rich domain-1
(CRD1), was still functional for signaling and that CRD2 of TACI was
sufficient for high-affinity binding to either murine April or human
BAFF (TNFSF13B). The solution structure of CRD2 of TACI revealed a
compact domain and additional ligand-binding determinants. Cocrystal
structures of murine April bound to CRD2 of human TACI or to human BCMA
(TNFRSF17; 109545) showed large interfaces and revealed key differences
that likely influence ligand-binding affinity and specificity.

Ingold et al. (2005) showed that the TNF homology domain of mouse and
human APRIL bound BCMA and TACI, whereas a basic sequence (QKQKKQ) close
to the N terminus of the mature protein bound negatively charged
sulfated glycosaminoglycan side chains of proteoglycans. Although T-cell
lines bound little APRIL, ectopic expression of glycosaminoglycan-rich
syndecans (see SDC1; 186355) or glypicans (see GPC1; 600395) conferred
on these cells a high binding capacity that was completely dependent on
the N-terminal basic sequence of APRIL. Moreover, SDC1-positive plasma
cells and proteoglycan-rich nonhematopoietic cells displayed high
specific, heparin-sensitive binding to APRIL. Inhibition of BAFF and
APRIL, but not BAFF alone, prevented survival and/or migration of newly
formed plasma cells to bone marrow. In addition, costimulation of B-cell
proliferation by APRIL was only effective upon APRIL oligomerization.
Ingold et al. (2005) proposed that APRIL binding to the extracellular
matrix or to proteoglycan-positive cells induces APRIL oligomerization,
which is the prerequisite for triggering TACI- and/or BCMA-mediated
activation, migration, and survival signals.

Using flow cytometry, fluorescence microscopy, and immunohistochemical
analysis, Huard et al. (2008) found that APRIL was expressed on
recruited neutrophils and accumulated on subepithelial heparan sulfate
proteoglycans in upper (e.g., tonsils) and lower (e.g., lamina propria)
mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) and contributed to survival of
plasma cells. Mice lacking April had less-persistent mucosal humoral
immunity. Huard et al. (2008) proposed that inflammation-recruited
neutrophils may create plasma cell niches in MALT to sustain local
antibody production.

GENE STRUCTURE

Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) determined that the TNFSF13 gene contains 6
exons.

MAPPING

Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) determined that the transcriptional start
site of the TNFSF13 gene lies 878 bp downstream of the TNFSF12 gene on
chromosome 17p13.1.

ANIMAL MODEL

By treating mice with TACI-Ig, Gross et al. (2001) determined that BLYS
and APRIL are required for the development of both transitional (T2) and
mature B lymphocytes. TACI-Ig-treated mice also had less circulating
immunoglobulin and produced less collagen-specific antibody. TACI-Ig
treatment inhibited the development of collagen-induced rheumatoid
arthritis. Gross et al. (2001) proposed that TACI-Ig may have a role in
both the prevention and treatment of autoimmune disease mediated by
pathogenic autoantibodies.

Stein et al. (2002) created mice expressing human APRIL as a transgene
in T cells. These mice appeared normal. Transgenic T cells showed
enhanced survival in vitro and enhanced survival of staphylococcal
enterotoxin B-reactive Cd4-positive T cells in vivo, and both of these
responses correlated with elevated Bcl2 levels. Analysis of humoral
responses to T cell-dependent antigens in the transgenic mice indicated
that APRIL affected IgM responses, but not IgG responses. In contrast, T
cell-independent type-2 (TI-2) humoral responses were enhanced in APRIL
transgenic mice. As TACI had been reported to be indispensable for TI-2
antibody formation, Stein et al. (2002) concluded that APRIL-TACI
interactions have a role in generating the TI-2 response and that APRIL
is involved in the induction and/or maintenance of T- and B-cell
responses.

To investigate the role of APRIL in immunity, Castigli et al. (2004)
generated April-deficient mice. April -/- mice had normal T and B
lymphocyte development, normal T and B cell proliferation in vitro, but
increased numbers of CD4+ effector/memory T cells and increased IgG
responses to T-dependent antigens. Serum IgA levels were significantly
decreased, and serum IgA antibody responses to mucosal immunization with
T-dependent antigens and to type 1 T-independent antigens were impaired
in April -/- mice. The results suggested that APRIL downregulates T
cell-dependent antibody responses and promotes IgA class switching.

602705	TITLE *602705 SYNAPSIN III; SYN3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Synapsins are a family of neuron-specific synaptic vesicle-associated
phosphoproteins that have been implicated in synaptogenesis and in the
modulation of neurotransmitter release. In mammals, distinct genes for
synapsins I (SYN1; 313440) and II (SYN2; 600755) have been identified,
each of which encodes 2 alternatively spliced isoforms. Kao et al.
(1998) cloned and characterized a third member of the synapsin gene
family, synapsin III, from human DNA. Synapsin III gives rise to at
least 1 protein isoform, designated synapsin IIIa, in several mammalian
species. Synapsin IIIa is associated with synaptic vesicles, and its
expression appears to be neuron-specific. The primary structure of
synapsin IIIa conforms to the domain model previously described for the
synapsin family, with domains A, C, and E exhibiting the highest degree
of conservation. Synapsin IIIa contains a novel domain, termed domain J,
located between domains C and E. The similarities among synapsins I, II,
and III in domain organization, neuron-specific expression, and
subcellular localization suggested a possible role for synapsin III in
the regulation of neurotransmitter release and synaptogenesis.

Hosaka and Sudhof (1998) identified the human SYN3 gene. Among the rat
tissues tested, they found that Syn3 was expressed only in brain. As in
other synapsins, the C domain of Syn3 bound ATP with high affinity and
ADP with a lower affinity, consistent with a cycle of ATP binding and
hydrolysis. However, unlike with Syn1 and Syn2, calcium inhibited ATP
binding to Syn3. The authors concluded that calcium has distinct
regulatory effects on Syn1, Syn2, and Syn3.

MAPPING

Kao et al. (1998) found that an anonymous marker from 22q12-q13,
D22S280, was located within an intron between exons 2 and 4 of the SYN3
gene.

GENE FUNCTION

Kao et al. (1998) noted that the 22q12-q13 region had previously been
identified as a potential schizophrenia susceptibility locus (600850).
D22S278, which was shown by the Schizophrenia Collaborative Linkage
Group (Chromosome 22) (1996) to be significantly associated with
schizophrenia, was approximately 4.5 cM removed from D22S280, located
within an intron of the SYN3 gene.

From a study in Taiwan, Tsai et al. (2002) presented data that did not
support a large effect of the synapsin III gene in the pathogenesis of
schizophrenia. They performed systematic sequencing of the protein
coding and 5-prime promoter regions in 62 Han Chinese schizophrenic
patients with a positive family history. Further case-control
association studies were performed using genetic polymorphic markers.

PICALM/AF10 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In the course of the molecular characterization of the translocation
t(10;11)(p13;q14) in the monocytic cell line U937, Dreyling et al.
(1996) identified a breakpoint on chromosome 11 involving the previously
unknown gene, CALM. CALM has a very high homology to the murine clathrin
assembly protein ap3 (Morris et al., 1993).

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Ford et al. (2001) presented the structure of the N-terminal domain of
CALM bound to phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate via a lysine-rich
motif. This motif is found in other proteins predicted to have domains
of similar structure (e.g., Huntingtin-interacting protein-1; 601767).
The structure is in part similar to the epsin (607262) N-terminal (ENTH)
domain, but epsin lacks the
phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate-binding site.

Mao et al. (2001) determined the crystal structure of the N-terminal
domain (the NAP domain) of the Drosophila Lap protein, which is
homologous to human PICALM. The structure revealed a novel fold
consisting of a large double layer of sheets of 10 alpha helices and a
unique site for binding phosphoinositides.

CYTOGENETICS

- PICALM/AF10 Fusion Gene

Dreyling et al. (1996) identified a breakpoint on chromosome 11
involving the CALM gene in the translocation t(10;11)(p13;q14) in the
monocytic cell line U937. The fusion partner of the CALM gene on
chromosome 11 was the putative transcription factor AF10 (602409)
located on 10p13. Dreyling et al. (1998) found that both MLL (159555)
and CALM are fused to AF10 in morphologically distinct subsets of acute
leukemia with t(10;11). Both rearrangements were associated with a poor
prognosis.

Bohlander et al. (2000) and Carlson et al. (2000) performed molecular
analyses of the CALM/AF10 fusion in cases of leukemia. Bohlander et al.
(2000) studied a series of 3 patients with AML, 1 patient with T-ALL,
and 2 patients with precursor T lymphoblastic lymphoma. The
rearrangements were essentially identical in all. In all 6 patients the
breakpoint in CALM was at the 3-prime end of the coding region. Three
breakpoints could be identified in AF10. The findings indicated that
CALM/AF10 fusions differ only slightly with respect to the portion of
AF10 present and that there is no obvious difference between the fusions
found in AML patients compared to those found in patients with lymphoid
malignancies. Carlson et al. (2000) studied 6 patients with myeloid
leukemia and 3 with T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia. They identified 4
different CALM/AF10 fusion products in 5 patients and AF10/CALM
reciprocal message in 1. Carlson et al. (2000) concluded that the fusion
of CALM and AF10 is a recurring abnormality in both lymphoid and myeloid
leukemias of various types including AML-M5; that the breakpoints in the
2 types of leukemia do not differ; and that the CALM/AF10 fusion product
on the derivative chromosome 10 is critical to leukemogenesis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

For a discussion of a possible association between variation in the
PICALM gene and late-onset Alzheimer disease, see 104300.

ANIMAL MODEL

Treusch et al. (2011) modeled amyloid-beta (see 104760) toxicity in
yeast by directing the peptide to the secretory pathway. A genomewide
screen for toxicity modifiers identified the yeast homolog of PICALM and
other endocytic factors connected to Alzheimer disease (104300) whose
relationship to amyloid-beta had been unknown. The factors identified in
yeast modified amyloid-beta toxicity in glutamatergic neurons of C.
elegans and in primary rat cortical neurons. In yeast, amyloid-beta
impaired the endocytic trafficking of a plasma membrane receptor, which
was ameliorated by endocytic pathway factors identified in the yeast
screen. Treusch et al. (2011) concluded that links between amyloid-beta,
endocytosis, and human Alzheimer disease risk factors can be ascertained
with yeast as a model system.

NOMENCLATURE

Mao et al. (2001) referred to PICALM as 'the human AP180.' However, the
true homolog of AP180 is SNAP91 (607923), a paralog of PICALM.

;;ATF7-INTERACTING PROTEIN;;
ATFA MODULATOR, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; AM;;
MBD1-CONTAINING CHROMATIN-ASSOCIATED FACTOR; MCAF;;
MCAF1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ATF7IP is a multifunctional nuclear protein that associates with
heterochromatin. It can act as a transcriptional coactivator or
corepressor depending upon its binding partners (summary by Liu et al.,
2009).

CLONING

Using mass spectroscopy to identify HeLa cell proteins that copurified
with SETDB1 (604396), followed by EST database and genomic sequence
analyses, Wang et al. (2003) cloned full-length ATF7IP, which they
called AM. The deduced 1,270-amino acid human protein shares 78%
identity with mouse Am, an Atfa (ATF7; 606371)-associated factor. Human
AM had an apparent molecular mass of 200 kD by SDS-PAGE.

Using the transcriptional repressor domain of MBD1 (156535) as bait in a
yeast 2-hybrid screen of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Fujita et al. (2003)
cloned ATF7IP, which they called MCAF. The deduced 1,270-amino acid
protein contains 2 conserved domains in its C-terminal half. Western
blot analysis detected endogenous MCAF at an apparent molecular mass of
about 200 kD in several human cell lines. MCAF and MBD1 colocalized in
multiple foci in HeLa cell interphase nuclei.

Uchimura et al. (2006) identified a highly conserved SUMO (see SUMO1;
601912)-interacting motif between the 2 C-terminal domains of human
MCAF1.

GENE FUNCTION

Wang et al. (2003) showed that recombinant mouse Am increased the
methyltransferase activity of recombinant mouse Setdb1 against histone
H3 (see 602810) lys9 (H3K9). The methyltransferase activity of the
recombinant Am-Setdb1 complex was comparable to that of the endogenous
AM-SETDB1 complex purified from HeLa cells. Am increased the turnover
rate of the reaction by increasing Vmax and decreasing Km. In the
absence of Am, the predominant Setdb1 product was dimethylated H3K9, and
in the presence of Am, the predominant Setdb1 product was trimethylated
H3K9. These results were confirmed by small interfering RNA-mediated
knockdown of AM in HEK293 cells and HeLa cells. Use of a reconstituted
chromatin transcription system revealed that Am also enhanced the
transcriptional repression activity of Setdb1.

Using reciprocal immunoprecipitation analysis and protein pull-down
assays, Fujita et al. (2003) confirmed a direct interaction between MCAF
and MBD1. Deletion analysis revealed that the C-terminal transcriptional
repressor domain (TRD) of MBD1 interacted with the most C-terminal
conserved domain of MCAF. Reporter gene assays showed that MCAF enhanced
SP1 (189906)-mediated transcription of several SP1-responsive promoters.
However, MCAF also increased the repressive function of the isolated TRD
of MBD1 against SP1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed
that MBD1 linked MCAF to methylated promoters. MCAF also associated with
unmethylated promoters regardless of the presence of MBD1.

Ichimura et al. (2005) showed that both MCAF1 and MCAF2 (ATF7IP2;
613645) bound to the C-terminal TRD of MBD1, as well as to SETDB1 and
SP1. Immunoprecipitation analysis of K562 human erythroleukemia cells
revealed that MCAF1 showed higher affinity for SETDB1 than SP1, whereas
MCAF2 showed higher affinity for SP1 than SETDB1. Both MCAF proteins
were also detected in the same immunoprecipitates. Both MCAF1 and MCAF2
increased transcription of a reporter gene activated by SP1, and the TRD
of MBD1 moderately repressed transcription in the presence of either
MCAF1 or MCAF2. The combination of MCAF1, the TRD of MBD1, and SETDB1
caused marked transcriptional repression in a SETDB1-dependent manner.
In contrast, SETDB1 had no effect on promoter activity in the presence
of MCAF2 and the TRD of MBD1. Knockdown of MCAF1 in HeLa cells abolished
repression by the TRD of MBD1, and exogenous expression of MCAF2 partly
compensated for MCAF1 knockdown.

Uchimura et al. (2006) found that MBD1 was multiply sumoylated in HeLa
cells and that sumoylation of MBD1 increased its interaction with MCAF1.
MCAF1 itself was not a target for sumoylation. MCAF1 and endogenous
SUMO1 or SUMO2 (603042)/SUMO3 (602231) partly colocalized at nuclear
foci in C-33A human cervical carcinoma cells. Knockdown of SUMO1 or
SUMO2/SUMO3 disrupted the association of MCAF1 with MBD1. SUMO knockdown
also disrupted the association of MBD1 with several factors required for
heterochromatin assembly, including HP1-beta (CBX1; 604511). Ectopic
expression of the SUMO-binding fragment of MCAF1 caused delocalization
of MCAF1 and HP1-beta, possibly by sequestration of free SUMO proteins.

Using protein pull-down assays and deletion analysis, Liu et al. (2009)
found that the 2 conserved domains of MCAF1 interacted directly with
overlapping C-terminal domains in SP1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation
analysis of HeLa cells revealed that both MCAF1 and SP1 associated with
the TERT (187270) and TERC (602322) promoter regions. Small interfering
RNA-mediated knockdown studies showed that MCAF1 interacted with the
TERT promoter in an SP1-dependent manner. Knockdown of either MCAF1 or
SP1 downregulated expression of TERT by reducing association of
phosphorylated RNA polymerase II (see 180660) and ERCC3 (133510) at the
TERT promoter and compromised telomere maintenance. Immunoprecipitation
analysis revealed that MCAF1 was contained in a general transcriptional
complex along with TFIIE-alpha (GTF2E1; 189962), TFIIE-beta (GTF2E2;
189964), ERCC2 (126340), and ERCC3. Protein pull-down assays and domain
analysis revealed that each of these proteins bound 1 or both conserved
domains of MCAF1.

MAPPING

Hartz (2010) mapped the ATF7IP gene to chromosome 12p13.1 based on an
alignment of the ATF7IP gene (GenBank GENBANK AK001550) with the genomic
sequence (GRCh37).

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

KLK7 belongs to the kallikrein subfamily of serine proteases, which are
involved in a variety of enzymatic processes (Gan et al., 2000).

CLONING

The stratum corneum is the outermost layer of the epidermis, i.e., the
stratified squamous epithelium lining the body surface. The cells of the
stratum corneum, the corneocytes, represent the end stage of the
epidermal differentiation process. Corneocytes are highly resistant
anucleated cells mainly consisting of keratin filaments surrounded by a
crosslinked protein envelope. The mechanical resistance of the stratum
corneum is dependent on the cohesion between individual corneocytes,
which is mediated to a major extent by modified desmosomes. Since a
fraction of epidermal cells continuously leaves the proliferating basal
layer and goes through differentiation, there is a continuous de novo
production of corneocytes. This is balanced to give a constant and
well-regulated stratum corneum thickness by cell shedding at the skin
surface in a process called desquamation. Desquamation means elimination
of stratum corneum cell cohesion in superficial cell layers. It has been
established that proteolysis of intercellular cohesive structures is of
major importance in the series of events preceding desquamation. Stratum
corneum chymotryptic enzyme (SCCE), or kallikrein-7 (KLK7), is a serine
proteinase with an inhibitor profile, pH dependence, and tissue
localization compatible with a role in desquamation. Egelrud (1993)
purified SCCE from human plantar corneocytes. SDS-PAGE indicated that
the purified preparation contained 1 major component with an apparent
molecular mass of 25 kD and 1 minor component with a slightly higher
apparent molecular mass. Both of these components were associated with
chymotrypsin-like activity, although SCCE differed significantly from
bovine chymotrypsin, human cathepsin G (116830), and human mast cell
chymases (see 118938) in its relative activity toward various substrates
and in its inhibitor profile. Hansson et al. (1994) sequenced the
N-terminal region of the native SCCE enzyme. By screening a human
keratinocyte cDNA library with a degenerate oligonucleotide based on the
amino acid sequence of SCCE, they isolated 2 forms of SCCE cDNA that
differed only in the 3-prime untranslated region. The predicted
253-amino acid protein consists of a 22-amino acid signal peptide and a
7-amino acid propeptide followed by the active enzyme. SCCE contains the
conserved active site regions of serine proteinases and a potential
N-glycosylation site. The amino acid sequence homology between SCCE and
human chymotrypsin, cathepsin G, and mast cell chymase, all of which
have chymotryptic activity, did not exceed 40%. Hansson et al. (1994)
demonstrated that SCCE is heterogenously glycosylated. Northern blot
analysis detected 1.2- and 2.0-kb SCCE transcripts in human skin.
Abundant SCCE mRNA expression was restricted to skin, with very low
levels of expression found in brain and kidney. Immunohistochemical
analyses had shown that the SCCE protein is present in high suprabasal
keratinocytes in the epidermis and in the keratinizing inner root sheet
of the hair follicle (Sondell et al., 1994). In the human oral cavity,
only suprabasal keratinocytes at sites where a stratum corneum is formed
contained SCCE.

Yousef et al. (2000) noted the presence of 12 cysteine residues in KLK7,
10 of which are conserved in all serine proteases, and 2 of which are
also found in other KLK proteins. RT-PCR analysis revealed expression
primarily in brain, mammary gland, cerebellum, spinal cord, kidney, and
skin, with lower levels or none detected in other tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Yousef et al. (2000) observed the upregulation of KLK7 expression in a
breast cancer cell in response to estrogens and glucocorticoids.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Yousef et al. (2000) determined that the
KLK7 gene contains 6 exons, 5 of which are coding. The gene spans 6 kb.

MAPPING

By computational analysis, Yousef et al. (2000) mapped the KLK7 gene to
chromosome 19q13.3-q13.4 between KLK6 (602652) and KLK8 (605644).

609806	TITLE *609806 HYDROXYMETHYLBILANE SYNTHASE; HMBS
;;PORPHOBILINOGEN DEAMINASE; PBGD;;
PRE-UROPORPHYRINOGEN SYNTHASE;;
UROPORPHYRINOGEN I SYNTHASE;;
UROPORPHYRINOGEN I SYNTHETASE
DESCRIPTION Porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD; EC 4.3.1.8) is the third enzyme of the
biosynthetic pathway leading to the production of heme. It catalyzes the
synthesis of hydroxymethylbilane by stepwise condensation of 4
porphobilinogen units. Hydroxymethylbilane is then converted to
uroporphyrinogen III by uroporphyrinogen III synthetase (UROS; 606938)
(Raich et al., 1986).

CLONING

Raich et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA clone corresponding to the human
erythrocyte porphobilinogen deaminase gene from a human erythrocyte
library prepared from human spleen. The deduced 334-amino acid protein
has a calculated molecular mass of approximately 37.6 kD. Northern blot
analysis identified a single 1.6-kb mRNA transcript.

Grandchamp et al. (1987) determined that there are 2 PBGD isoforms that
differ by approximately 2 kD (40 and 42 kD). One is active in all
tissues and can be isolated from liver, and the other is restricted to
erythrocytes. The nonerythrocyte isoform contains an additional 17 amino
acid residues at the N terminus.

Chretien et al. (1988) demonstrated that the PBGD gene undergoes
alternative splicing with 2 different promoters to yield 2 mRNAs. The
first 'upstream' promoter is active in all tissues and has structural
features of a housekeeping promoter, whereas the second promoter,
located 3 kb downstream, is active only in erythrocytes and shows
structural homology to the beta-globin gene (141900) promoters. The 2
mRNAs differ only in their first exon.

Gubin and Miller (2001) identified 2 alternatively spliced isoforms of
erythroid PBGD in CD34+/- (142230) erythroid precursor cells. Complete
sequencing showed that the alternatively spliced form, designated
PBGD-EA, contained the intron between exons 2 and 3, thus extending the
5-prime untranslated region of the erythroid transcript by 176 bp.
Northern blot analysis identified a distinct 1.5-kb mRNA corresponding
to the alternatively spliced erythrocyte isoform only in bone marrow and
fetal spleen.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chretien et al. (1988) determined that the HMBS gene contains 15 exons
and spans approximately 10 kb of DNA.

The housekeeping HMBS transcript contains exons 1 and 3-15; the
erythroid HMBS transcript is encoded by exons 2-15 (Chen et al., 1994).

MAPPING

By study of mouse-human hybrid clones, Meisler et al. (1980, 1981)
showed that PBG-deaminase is determined by a gene on chromosome 11; Wang
et al. (1981) assigned the locus to the long arm in the segment
11q23-qter. In 3 children with trisomy of 11qter, de Verneuil et al.
(1982) studied expression of uroporphyrinogen I synthase. Dosage effect
supported assignment to the region 11q23.2-qter.

By in situ hybridization and by gene dosage studies in patients with
monosomy or trisomy of the terminal portion of 11q, Namba et al. (1991)
refined the assignment of the PBGD gene to 11q24.1-q24.2.

Tunnacliffe and McGuire (1990) constructed a long-range restriction map
extending over 1.8 Mb of 11q23.3 using pulsed field gel electrophoresis
and concluded that PBGD is situated in the following relation to 5 other
genes: cen--CD3E--CD3D--CD3G--PBGD--CBL2--THY1--qter. They determined
that the CD3G (186740) gene and PBGD are separated by 750 kb.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

By the method of isoelectric focusing, Meisler and Carter (1980)
identified structural variants of PBG-deaminase.

Louie et al. (1992) defined the 3-domain structure of PBGD by x-ray
analysis. Two of the domains structurally resembled the transferrins
(see, e.g., TF; 190000). The x-ray structure and results from
site-directed mutagenesis provided evidence for a single catalytic site.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a large Dutch family with the nonerythroid variant of AIP, Grandchamp
et al. (1989) identified a heterozygous splice site mutation in intron 1
of the PBGD gene (609806.0001). The mutation interrupted the sequence
coding for the nonerythroid isoform of PBGD; thus, expression of the
erythroid isoform was unaffected. In a patient with CRM-positive AIP,
Grandchamp et al. (1989) identified a mutation in the HMBS gene,
resulting in the skipping of exon 12 (609806.0002).

In affected members of 11 different families with either CRM-negative or
CRM-positive AIP, Grandchamp et al. (1990) identified 7 different point
mutations in the PBGD gene.

In a patient with the nonerythroid variant of AIP, Chen et al. (1994)
identified a mutation in the initiation codon of the housekeeping HMBS
isoform (M1V; 609806.0044). Puy et al. (1998) identified 3 different
mutations in the donor splice site of the HMBS gene in 4 unrelated
patients with the nonerythroid variant of AIP. They found that the
splice site mutations resulted in activation of a cryptic splice site
located 67 nucleotides downstream from the normal splice site, leading
to a frameshift and premature stop codon in exon 4.

In 28 Finnish families representing 72% of all AIP families in the
Finnish population of 5 million, Kauppinen et al. (1995) found 19
separate mutations in HMBS: 13 novel mutations, including 1 de novo
event, and 6 previously characterized mutations.

Whatley et al. (1999) found 39 different mutations in the HMBS gene in
54 of 57 consecutive patients with AIP.

In patients with the nonerythroid variant of AIP, Whatley et al. (2000)
identified mutations in the housekeeping promoter (-154delG;
609806.0041) and in exon 3 (41delA; 609806.0042) of the HMBS gene.

Floderus et al. (2002) studied most of the AIP kindreds in Sweden. They
identified 27 novel mutations in the HMBS gene, bringing the total
number of known mutations in the HMBS gene in Sweden to 39. Most of the
mutations were located in exons 10 and 12, with fewer in exon 7.
Floderus et al. (2002) used the 3-dimensional structure of the
porphobilinogen deaminase enzyme to predict the possible molecular and
functional consequences of the novel Swedish missense and nonsense
mutations.

In a patient with AIP, Hessels et al. (2004) detected a novel homozygous
leu81-to-pro (L81P) mutation in exon 6 of the HMBS gene (609806.0045).
Porphobilinogen deaminase activity in red cells was decreased to 2 to
4%.

ANIMAL MODEL

Clavero et al. (2010) described a naturally occurring feline model of
AIP in 4 unrelated cat lines that presented phenotypically as congenital
erythropoietic porphyria (CEP; 263700). Affected cats had erythrodontia,
brownish urine, fluorescent bones, and markedly elevated urinary
uroporphyrin and coproporphyrin, consistent with CEP. However, their
UROS activities (deficient in CEP) were normal. Notably, affected cats
had half-normal HMBS activities and elevated urinary 5-aminolevulinic
acid and porphobilinogen. Sequencing the feline Hmbs gene revealed
different mutations in each line, including a duplication, an in-frame
3-bp deletion (842delGAG), and 2 missense (A84T and R149W) mutations.
The 842delGAG and R149W mutations were identical to mutations reported
in human. Prokaryotic expression of the 842delGAG and R149W mutations
resulted in mutant enzymes with less than 1% wildtype activity, whereas
the A84T mutation expressed a stable enzyme with approximately 35% of
wildtype activity. The discolored teeth from the affected cats contained
markedly elevated URO I and III, accounting for the CEP-like phenocopy.
In 3 lines, the phenotype was an autosomal dominant trait, while
affected cats with the A84T mutation were homozygous, a unique recessive
form of AIP.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PORPHYRIA, ACUTE INTERMITTENT, NONERYTHROID VARIANT
HMBS, IVS1DS, G-A, +1

In affected members of a large Dutch family with the nonerythroid
variant of acute intermittent porphyria (176000), Grandchamp et al.
(1989) identified a G-to-A transition in the 5-prime splice donor site
of intron 1 of the HMBS gene. The mutation interrupted the sequence
coding for the nonerythroid isoform of PBGD; thus, expression of the
erythroid isoform was unaffected. Hybridization analysis using
oligonucleotide probes after in vitro amplification of genomic DNA
offered another possibility of detecting asymptomatic carriers of the
mutation in affected families.

Puy et al. (1997, 1998) identified this splice site mutation in patients
with nonerythroid variant AIP.

Petrides (1998) identified the G-to-A transition in intron 1 of the HMBS
gene in 9 members of a German kindred in which the proband had a
life-threatening coma due to the nonerythroid variant of AIP. The newly
identified family members were taught how to prevent porphyric attacks.

.0002
PORPHYRIA, ACUTE INTERMITTENT
HMBS, EX12DEL

In a patient with acute intermittent porphyria (176000), Grandchamp et
al. (1989) identified a G-to-A transition in exon 12 of the HMBS gene,
resulting in the skipping of exon 12. The resulting aberrant mRNA
encoded a truncated protein that was inactive, but stable, and could be
detected using antibodies directed against the normal enzyme
(CRM-positive).

.0003
PORPHYRIA, ACUTE INTERMITTENT, NONERYTHROID VARIANT
HMBS, IVS1DS, G-T, +1

In a Finnish family with the nonerythroid variant of acute intermittent
porphyria (176000) Grandchamp et al. (1989) identified a G-to-T
transversion in the 5-prime splice donor sequence of intron 1 of the
HMBS gene. This is only 1 nucleotide removed from the mutation listed as
609806.0001, in which the change occurred in the first nucleotide of
intron 1. Grandchamp et al. (1989) proposed that both of these mutations
resulted in an abnormal splicing of primary transcripts initiated at the
upstream promoter of the gene without affecting the expression of the
PBGD gene in erythroid cells where the downstream promoter is utilized.
A similar mutation located at the last position of exon 1 of the
beta-globin gene was found by Vidaud et al. (1989) to be responsible for
a splicing defect leading to beta-thalassemia.

.0004
PORPHYRIA, ACUTE INTERMITTENT
HMBS, ARG116TRP

In affected members of a Swedish family with AIP (176000), Lee et al.
(1990) identified a C-to-T transition in exon 8 of the HMBS gene,
resulting in an arg116-to-trp (R116W) substitution.

The R116W mutation was found by Gu et al. (1993) in 15 Dutch AIP
families and in 1 French AIP family.

.0005
PORPHYRIA, ACUTE INTERMITTENT
HMBS, ARG167GLN

In patients with AIP (176000), Delfau et al. (1990) identified a G-to-A
transition in exon 10 of the HMBS gene, resulting in an arg167-to-gln
(R167Q) substitution.

In a brother and sister with severe AIP (176000), Llewellyn et al.
(1992) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the PBGD
gene: a 500G-A transition, resulting in an R167Q substitution, and a
499C-T transition, resulting in an R167W substitution (609806.0013). The
mutations occurred in adjacent nucleotides.

.0006

HMBS, ARG173GLN

In patients with AIP (176000), Delfau et al. (1990) identified a G-to-A
transition in exon 10 of the HMBS gene, resulting in an arg173-to-gln
(R173Q) substitution.

Kauppinen et al. (1992) identified the R173Q substitution in 3 out of 7
Finnish families with CRM-positive AIP.

.0007
PORPHYRIA, ACUTE INTERMITTENT
HMBS, GLN155TER

In 1 of 43 unrelated patients with AIP (176000), Scobie et al. (1990)
identified a C-to-T transition in the HMBS gene, resulting in a
gln155-to-ter (Q155X) substitution.

.0008
PORPHYRIA, ACUTE INTERMITTENT
HMBS, ARG149GLN

In a patient with AIP (176000), Delfau et al. (1991) identified a 446G-A
transition in exon 9 of the HMBS gene, resulting in an arg149-to-gln
(R159Q) substitution.

.0009
PORPHYRIA, ACUTE INTERMITTENT
HMBS, LEU245ARG

In a patient with AIP (176000), Delfau et al. (1991) identified a 734T-G
transversion in exon 12 of the HMBS gene, resulting in a leu245-to-arg
(L245R) substitution.

.0010
PORPHYRIA, ACUTE INTERMITTENT
HMBS, 1-BP DEL, 900T

In a patient with CRM-positive AIP (176000), Delfau et al. (1991)
identified a 1-bp deletion (900delT) in exon 1 of the HMBS gene,
resulting in a stop codon located 15 codons downstream from the
deletion.

.0011
PORPHYRIA, ACUTE INTERMITTENT
HMBS, 9-BP DEL, EX10

In a patient with CRM-positive AIP (176000), Delfau et al. (1991)
identified a deletion of the last 9 bp of exon 10. This resulted from
abnormal splicing of intron 10 which was a consequence of a G-to-T
substitution of the last base of exon 10.

.0012
PORPHYRIA, ACUTE INTERMITTENT
HMBS, TRP198TER

In affected members of a northern Swedish (Lappland) family with AIP
(176000), Lee and Anvret (1991) identified a G-to-A transition in exon
10 of the HMBS gene, resulting in a trp198-to-ter (W198X) substitution.
The same mutation was found in 15 of 33 Swedish AIP families. Genealogic
data showed that 12 of the 15 were related, indicating a founder effect.

.0013
PORPHYRIA, ACUTE INTERMITTENT
HMBS, ARG167TRP

In a brother and sister with severe AIP (176000), Llewellyn et al.
(1992) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the PBGD
gene: a 499C-T transition, resulting in an arg167-to-trp (R167W)
substitution, and an adjacent 500G-A transition, resulting in an R167Q
(609806.0005) substitution.

The seemingly high frequency of mutations in exon 10 (Delfau et al.,
1990) prompted Gu et al. (1992) to screen this exon in 41 unrelated AIP
patients by use of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) after
PCR amplification. In about one-fourth of the patients, they
distinguished 3 abnormal migration patterns, indicating the presence of
mutation in heterozygous state. Sequencing demonstrated the presence of
3 different single-base substitutions: R167Q, R173Q (609806.0006), and
R167W.

In Finland, Kauppinen et al. (1992) found an R167W mutation in 3 out of
7 families with CRM-positive AIP. DNA analyses of family members
demonstrated that conventional assays of erythrocyte PBGD activity
identified correctly only 72% of the carriers of the mutation.

Solis et al. (2004) reported a Spanish AIP patient who was homozygous
for the R167W substitution. Both parents were heterozygous for the
mutation. The patient had a severe course, with psychomotor delay,
dystonic movements, axial hypotonia, delayed myelination, and death at
age 40 months.

Solis et al. (2004) noted that the R167W, R173Q, and R167Q mutations all
occur at CpG dinucleotides within exon 10, and can thus be considered
mutation hotspots. All 3 substitutions alter highly conserved arginines
in the enzyme's active site, which interact with the precursor
porphobilinogen and the acidic side chains of the enzyme's
dipyrromethane cofactor. Functional expression studies showed that all 3
substitutions resulted in less than 2% normal HMBS activity.

.0014
PORPHYRIA, ACUTE INTERMITTENT
HMBS, ARG167LEU

Using site-directed mutagenesis, Lander et al. (1991) demonstrated that
an arg167-to-leu (R167L) substitution in the HMBS protein resulted in a
profound decrease of PBGD activity, consistent with AIP (176000). It is
noteworthy that substitution of arg167 by glutamine (R167Q; 609806.0005)
and by tryptophan (R167W; 609806.0013) resulted in loss of enzyme
activity.

HMBS, ARG26HIS

In a patient with CRM-positive AIP (176000), Llewellyn et al. (1993)

In a patient with CRM-negative AIP (176000), Gu et al. (1994) identified
a 331G-A transversion in exon 7 of the HMBS gene, resulting in a
gly111-to-arg (G111R) substitution.

In Argentina, De Siervi et al. (1999) found that the G111R mutation was
present in 12 of 26 (46%) presumably unrelated propositi with AIP;
haplotype analysis with intragenic and flanking markers indicated an
ancestral founder.

PORPHYRIA, ACUTE INTERMITTENT
HMBS, 8-BP INS

In a patient with CRM-negative AIP (176000), Gu et al. (1994) identified
an 8-bp insertion at position 742 of the coding sequence in exon 12 of
the HMBS gene. This frameshift mutation leads to a premature termination
10 codons downstream and a truncated protein.

.0031
PORPHYRIA, ACUTE INTERMITTENT
HMBS, GLU250LYS

In a patient with CRM-negative AIP (176000), Gu et al. (1994) identified
a 748G-A transversion in exon 12 of the HMBS gene, resulting in a
glu250-to-lys (E250K) substitution.

.0032
PORPHYRIA, ACUTE INTERMITTENT
HMBS, ALA252THR

In a patient with AIP (176000), Mgone et al. (1993) identified a 754G-A
transversion in exon 12 of the HMBS gene, resulting in an ala252-to-thr
(A252T) substitution.

.0033
PORPHYRIA, ACUTE INTERMITTENT
HMBS, ALA252VAL

In a patient with AIP (176000), Mgone et al. (1993) identified a 755C-T
transition in exon 12 of the HMBS gene, resulting in an ala252-to-val
(A252V) substitution.

.0034
PORPHYRIA, ACUTE INTERMITTENT
HMBS, HIS256ASN

In a patient with AIP (176000), Mgone et al. (1993) identified a 766C-A
transversion in exon 12 of the HMBS gene, resulting in a his256-to-asn
(H256N) substitution.

.0035
PORPHYRIA, ACUTE INTERMITTENT
HMBS, IVS12DS, G-C, +1

In a Japanese patient with AIP (176000), Daimon et al. (1993) identified
a 771G-C transversion in the first nucleotide of the donor site of
intron 12 of the HMBS gene, resulting in aberrant splicing and the
skipping of exon 12.

.0036
PORPHYRIA, ACUTE INTERMITTENT
HMBS, IVS14DS, G-A, +1

In a patient with CRM-negative AIP (176000), Gu et al. (1993) identified
a 912G-A transition in the first nucleotide of the donor splice site of
intron 14 of the HMBS gene, resulting in abnormal splicing and the
skipping of exon 14.

.0037
PORPHYRIA, ACUTE INTERMITTENT
HMBS, IVS6DS, G-C, +1

In affected members of 28 Swedish families with CRM-negative AIP
(176000), Lundin et al. (1997) identified a G-to-C transversion at the
splice donor site of intron 6 of the HMBS gene.

.0038
PORPHYRIA, ACUTE INTERMITTENT
HMBS, GLY216ASP

In affected members of a Swedish family with CRM-negative AIP (176000),
Lundin et al. (1997) identified a 646G-A transition in exon 11 of the
HMBS gene, resulting in a gly216-to-asp (G216D) substitution.

.0039
PORPHYRIA, ACUTE INTERMITTENT
HMBS, 2-BP DEL, 847TG

In affected members of a Swedish family with AIP (176000), Lundin et al.
(1997) identified a 2-bp deletion (847delTG) in exon 14 of the HMBS
gene, resulting in an mRNA translational frameshift.

.0040
PORPHYRIA, ACUTE INTERMITTENT
HMBS, ALU INS

Mustajoki et al. (1999) reported a large Finnish family in which an Alu
element interfered with the coding region of the PBGD gene, resulting in
acute intermittent porphyria (176000). A 333-bp Alu sequence was
directly inserted into exon 5 in antisense orientation. Mustajoki et al.
(1999) noted that this Alu cassette belongs to a Ya5 subfamily, one of
the evolutionarily youngest and at that time most active Alu
subfamilies.

.0041
PORPHYRIA, ACUTE INTERMITTENT, NONERYTHROID VARIANT
HMBS, 1-BP DEL, -154G

Whatley et al. (2000) identified a 1-bp deletion (-154delG) in the
promoter region of the HMBS gene as the cause of the nonerythroid
variant of AIP (176000). Reporter gene and electromobility shift assays
showed that the G nucleotide at position -154, the most 5-prime of
several transcription initiation sites in the ubiquitous HMBS promoter,
which lies immediately 3-prime to a transcription factor IIB binding
motif, is essential for normal transcription.

.0042
PORPHYRIA, ACUTE INTERMITTENT, NONERYTHROID VARIANT
HMBS, 1-BP DEL, 41A

Whatley et al. (2000) identified a 1-bp deletion (41delA) in exon 3 of
the HMBS gene as the cause of the nonerythroid variant of AIP (176000).
The frameshift mutation introduced a stop codon into mRNA for the
ubiquitous isoform only.

.0043
PORPHYRIA, ACUTE INTERMITTENT
HMBS, TRP283TER

In a patient with AIP (176000), Chen et al. (1994) identified a
heterozygous 848G-A transition in exon 14 of the HMBS gene, resulting in
a trp283-to-ter (W283X) substitution.

Nearly 60% of all Swiss AIP patients carry the W283X mutation. In
France, the prevalence of W283X is less than 5% (Schneider-Yin et al.,
2002). In 12 of 25 AIP families of Swiss and French origin,
Schneider-Yin et al. (2002) identified a common haplotype containing the
W283X HMBS mutation. The authors suggested that a single mutational
event took place approximately 40 generations ago (i.e., 1,000 years
ago).

.0044
PORPHYRIA, ACUTE INTERMITTENT, NONERYTHROID VARIANT
HMBS, MET1VAL

In a patient with the nonerythroid variant of AIP (176000), Chen et al.
(1994) identified a heterozygous 3G-A transition in exon 1 of the HMBS
gene, resulting in a met1-to-val (M1V) substitution in the initiation of
translation codon for the housekeeping transcript. Thus, translation of
the erythrocyte transcript was unaffected.

.0045
PORPHYRIA, ACUTE INTERMITTENT
HMBS, LEU81PRO

In a 7-year-old boy with acute intermittent porphyria (176000), Hessels
et al. (2004) detected a homozygous leu-to-pro substitution at codon 81
(L81P) in exon 6 of the HMBS gene. Porphobilinogen activity in red cells
was decreased to 2 to 4%. Both parents were heterozygous and
asymptomatic. Leu81 in PBG deaminase is an evolutionarily conserved
residue in the second alpha helix, suggesting its structural importance
for preservation of enzyme activity.

.0046
PORPHYRIA, ACUTE INTERMITTENT
HMBS, ARG149TER

In affected members of 2 Finnish families with acute intermittent
porphyria (176000), Kauppinen et al. (1995) identified a heterozygous
445C-T transition in exon 9 of the HMBS gene, resulting in an
arg149-to-ter (R149X) substitution.

Poblete-Gutierrez et al. (2006) identified a heterozygous R149X
substitution in affected members of the original family with so-called
'Chester type porphyria' (McColl et al., 1985) (see 176000). The
mutation was not found in 200 control chromosomes. The family had
originally been reported as having features of both AIP and variegated
porphyria (VP; 176200), but no mutations in the PPOX gene (600923) were
identified. The mutation occurred at a hypermutable CpG dinucleotide.
The findings confirmed that Chester type porphyria is a variant of AIP.
Poblete-Gutierrez et al. (2006) suggested that the original biochemical
studies indicating PPOX deficiency may have been erroneous or
misinterpreted. A different mutation in this codon has also been
associated with AIP (R149Q; 609806.0008).

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Miwa et al. (1991) isolated recombinant phages that carried the human
smooth muscle (enteric) gamma-actin gene (which they symbolized ACTSG)
from human genomic DNA libraries.

Ueyama et al. (1995) isolated genomic clones containing the ACTG2 gene,
which has also been symbolized ACTA3.

Szucsik and Lessard (1995) characterized the mouse smooth muscle
(enteric) gamma-actin gene. It represented the largest isoactin gene
characterized to that time, measuring over 23,000 bp from the
transcription start site to the polyadenylation signal. The gene encodes
a mature actin protein of 374 amino acids.

GENE STRUCTURE

Miwa et al. (1991) determined that the human ACTG2 gene contains one
5-prime untranslated exon and 8 coding exons extending for 27 kb.

Szucsik and Lessard (1995) determined that the mouse Actg2 gene contains
9 exons.

GENE FAMILY

From the characterized molecular structures of the 6 human actin isoform
genes, Miwa et al. (1991) proposed a hypothesis of the evolutionary
pathway of the actin gene family. Each of the 5 other actin genes maps
to a separate chromosome.

MAPPING

Miwa et al. (1991) mapped the human ACTG2 gene to chromosome 2 by study
of rodent-human somatic cell hybrids. Ueyama et al. (1995) mapped the
ACTG2 gene to 2p13.1 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

GENETIC VARIABILITY

Ueyama et al. (1995) demonstrated that the HindIII RFLP in the first
intron of the ACTG2 gene is due to the presence/absence of a 24-bp
sequence harboring a HindIII restriction site. A biallelic system was
found to have allelic frequencies of 45 (HindIII-minus):55
(HindIII-Plus).

By studying lymphoblastoid cells, Cheung et al. (2003) studied natural
variation in human gene expression. The variance ratio of 813 genes
ranged from 0.4 to 64 with a median value of 2.5. In an examination of
the actual variances of expression levels of ACTG2 and 4 other highly
variable genes, ACTG2 showed the highest variance ratio; in 35 persons
studied, its expression level varied by a factor of 17. In an
examination of the gene transcript levels of ACTG2 and 4 other highly
variable genes among 3 groups of people (49 unrelated individuals,
offspring from 5 CEPH families, and 10 pairs of monozygotic twins), the
variance among unrelated individuals was 3 to 11 times greater than that
between monozygotic twins, and the variance among sibs was 2 to 5 times
greater than that between twins.

;;C3ORF29;;
EGG-DERIVED TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF;;
HJUMPY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The MTMR14 gene encodes a muscle-specific inositide phosphatase that
acts specifically on phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P2),
and possibly other targets, and plays a critical role in skeletal muscle
calcium homeostasis and likely other cellular processes (summary by
Romero-Suarez et al., 2010).

CLONING

From a database screen for protein sequences similar to human
myotubularin (300415), which is mutated in a form of centronuclear
myopathy (CNMX; 310400), Tosch et al. (2006) identified a novel protein,
MTMR14, with high homology to Drosophila egg-derived tyrosine
phosphatase (EDTP). The authors called this protein hJUMPY because
disruption of EDTP protein function in Drosophila causes a phenotype
termed JUMPY: a muscle defect and a progressive loss of muscle control
together with shaky and slower movements. The deduced 650-amino acid
MTMR14 protein contains a predicted protein tyrosine phosphatase and
dual-specificity phosphatase (PTP/DSP) domain and the canonical C(X)5R
consensus present in active PTP/DSPs. The MTMR14 catalytic loop shows
closest resemblance to that of active myotubularins. Northern blot
analysis detected a 2.5-kb MTMR14 transcript with highest expression in
skeletal muscle and heart and lower expression in placenta, kidney,
liver, pancreas, and lung. Immunofluorescence studies showed that MTMR14
localizes to cytoplasmic reticular structures and plasma membrane
ruffles, and displays a concentration near the nucleus of COS-1 cells.
MTMR14 was more concentrated in structures positive for giantin
(602500), a Golgi marker.

Shen et al. (2009) identified the MTMR14 protein as a phosphatase
predominantly expressed in skeletal and heart muscle. The human and
mouse proteins share 90% amino acid sequence homology.

GENE FUNCTION

By quantitative PCR in mice, Tosch et al. (2006) showed that expression
of Mtmr14 increased with C2C12 myotubule formation and differentiation
in culture. Using in vitro and ex vivo approaches, Tosch et al. (2006)
demonstrated that MTMR14 is a PPIn 3-phosphatase that dephosphorylates
the same substrates as myotubularin, PtdIns(3)P and PtdIns(3,5)P2.

Shen et al. (2009) also demonstrated that MTMR14 dephosphorylates a
variety of PtdInsPs, particularly PtdIns(3,5)P2.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tosch et al. (2006) determined that the MTMR14 gene contains 19 exons;
EST database analysis indicated that exons 17 and 18 are alternatives.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Tosch et al. (2006) mapped the MTMR14 gene
to chromosome 3p25.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Tosch et al. (2006) described 2 sporadic cases of centronuclear myopathy
in which each proband carried a heterozygous missense mutation in the
MTMR14 gene. The first proband and his unaffected father carried an
R336Q substitution (611089.0001). A second mutant allele was postulated,
but not identified. The other proband carried a Y462C substitution in
MTMR14 (611089.0002) and an additional missense mutation in DYN2 (E368K;
602378.0007), consistent with autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy
(160150). The Y462C mutation was also found in a control individual.
Both variants impaired enzymatic function, the R336Q mutation strongly
and the Y462C mutation to a lesser extent. Tosch et al. (2006) remarked
that myotubular myopathy patients with other characterized mutations in
DYN2 usually have an age of onset in childhood or adulthood, whereas the
age of onset in their patient was neonatal. The report raised the
possibility of MTMR14 being a modifier of the phenotype in some cases of
centronuclear myopathy.

ANIMAL MODEL

Shen et al. (2009) found that Mtmr14-null mice had muscle weakness and
increased fatigue with exercise. Isolated muscles from mutant mice
showed decreased contractile force, exacerbated fatigue, and prolonged
relaxation compared to muscle from wildtype mice. Mtmr14 deficiency
resulted in increased elevated resting calcium levels in myotubes due to
spontaneous calcium leakage from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This
leakage was attributed to decreased activity of Mtmr14 phosphatase
activity and accumulation of substrates, especially PtdIns(3,5)P2 and
PtdIns(3,4)P2. In addition, PtdIns(3,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4)P2 bound to and
directly activated the RYR1 (180901) calcium release channel in the
sarcoplasmic reticulum. The findings indicated that fine control of
PtdInsP levels in muscle cells is essential for maintaining calcium
homeostasis and muscle performance.

Normal aging is associated with sarcopenia, or a decrease in muscle mass
and function. Romero-Suarez et al. (2010) found that Mtmr14-null mice
manifested features of sarcopenia much earlier (12 to 14 months)
compared to wildtype mice (22 to 24 months). In particular, young and
mature mutant mice behaved like old wildtype mice, indicating earlier
onset of locomotor dysfunction in mutant mice. These changes were
associated with muscle atrophy and a decrease in contractile force and
power in the muscles of mutant mice. Wildtype mice showed downregulation
of Mtmr14 during normal aging, and muscle tissue from both old wildtype
and mutant mature mice showed dysfunctional calcium homeostasis, with
increased resting calcium levels and decreased calcium release from the
sarcoplasmic reticulum when triggered. The findings indicated that
Mtmr14 is a potent regulator of skeletal muscle function under normal
conditions and that its downregulation may contribute to age-related
sarcopenia. Romero-Suarez et al. (2010) concluded that loss of Mtmr14
results in altered PtdIns(3,5)P2 signaling, as well as altered calcium
signaling, which can affect a variety of cell processes.

Dowling et al. (2010) examined zebrafish MTMR14 using gene dosage
manipulation. As with MTM1 (300415) knockdown, morpholino-mediated
knockdown of MTMR14 resulted in morphologic abnormalities, a
developmental motor phenotype characterized by diminished spontaneous
contractions and abnormal escape response, and impaired
excitation-contraction coupling. In contrast to MTM1 knockdown, however,
muscle ultrastructure was unaffected. Double knockdown of MTM1 and
MTMR14 significantly impaired motor function and altered skeletal muscle
ultrastructure. The combined effect of reducing levels of both MTMR14
and MTM1 was significantly more severe than either knockdown alone, an
effect which may be mediated by increased autophagy. The authors
concluded that MTMR14 is required for motor function and, in combination
with MTM1, is required for myocyte homeostasis and normal embryonic
development.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MYOPATHY, CENTRONUCLEAR, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT, MODIFIER OF
MTMR14, ARG336GLN

Tosch et al. (2006) reported a 12-year old Brazilian boy with
centronuclear myopathy (160150) who presented with neonatal hypotonia,
proximal muscle weakness, and ophthalmoparesis. Both he and his
clinically unaffected father were heterozygous for a 1007G-A transition
in exon 11 of the MTMR14 gene. The mutation was predicted to result in
an arg336-to-gln (R336Q) substitution in a highly conserved region of
the active site of the protein. The mutation was not found in 820
control chromosomes. Immunoprecipitation assays detected a strong
decrease in the phosphatase activity of the R336Q mutant, 22% of the
level of wildtype. A second mutation in MTMR14 was not identified, and
the patient did not have a mutation in exons or splice sites of the DNM2
gene (602378). Tosch et al. (2006) hypothesized that another mutant
allele in either the MTMR14 gene or in another gene must be present.

.0002
MYOPATHY, CENTRONUCLEAR, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT, MODIFIER OF
MTMR14, TYR462CYS

Tosch et al. (2006) reported a 36-year-old woman with centronuclear
myopathy-1 (160150) caused by a heterozygous missense mutation in the
DNM2 gene (E368K; 602378.0007) who also carried a heterozygous 1385A-G
transition in exon 16 of the MTMR14 gene, resulting in a tyr462-to-cys
(Y462C) substitution in a semiconserved region outside of the active
site of the protein. The Y462C mutation was found in 1 of 700 Brazilian
control chromosomes. The Y462C mutant displayed 80% of the phosphatase
activity of the wildtype protein in immunoprecipitation assays. Both
mutations occurred de novo. The patient presented with neonatal
hypotonia, muscle weakness, and ophthalmoparesis. The report raised the
possibility of MTMR14 being a modifier of the phenotype in some cases of
centronuclear myopathy.

607376	TITLE *607376 DYNACTIN 2; DCTN2
;;DYNAMITIN;;
DYNACTIN COMPLEX, 50-KD SUBUNIT; DCTN50
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DCTN2 is a 50-kD subunit of dynactin, a multiprotein complex associated
with dynein. Cytoplasmic dynein is a molecular motor responsible for
minus-end-directed movement along microtubules. See DCTN1 (601143) and
DNCH1 (600112) for additional information about the dynactin complex and
dynein.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the DCTN2
gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP RH70660).

ANIMAL MODEL

LaMonte et al. (2002) generated a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS; 105400) by overexpressing dynamitin in postnatal motor
neurons of transgenic mice. They found that dynamitin overexpression
disrupted the dynein-dynactin complex, resulting in an inhibition of
retrograde axonal transport. The authors observed a late-onset, slowly
progressive motor neuron degenerative disease in the transgenic mice and
concluded that their mouse model confirms the critical role of disrupted
axonal transport in the pathogenesis of motor neuron degenerative
disease.

603940	TITLE *603940 POTASSIUM CHANNEL, SUBFAMILY K, MEMBER 7; KCNK7
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Members of the tandem pore domain potassium (K2P) channel family, such
as TWIK1 (601745) and TREK (603219), contain 4 transmembrane domains and
2 pore-forming (P) domains. See KCNK6 (603939). By searching an EST
database for sequences related to mouse Kcnk6, Salinas et al. (1999)
isolated a human cDNA encoding a novel potassium channel, which they
designated KCNK7. RT-PCR revealed that exon skipping gives rise to 5
mRNA species encoding 3 protein forms, KCNK7-A, -B, and -C. The
predicted 307-amino acid KCNK7A form is the longest; KCNK7B and KCNK7C
have truncated cytoplasmic C termini. Sequence analysis revealed that
the KCNK7 protein contains 4 potential transmembrane segments and 2 P
domains. The P2 domain contains a very unconventional GLE motif instead
of the GLG found in TWIK1 and KCNK6 or the GFG found in other K2P
channels. The core region spanning the 4 transmembrane domains of KCNK7A
shares 80% and 42% protein sequence identity with those of Kcnk6 and
TWIK1, respectively. As with Kcnk6, none of the KCNK7 protein forms were
able to generate channel activity when expressed in mammalian cells.

MAPPING

By analysis of radiation hybrids, Salinas et al. (1999) mapped the KCNK7
gene to 11q13.

603647	TITLE *603647 BCS1, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG-LIKE; BCS1L
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The human BCS1L gene encodes a homolog of S. cerevisiae bcs1 protein
involved in the assembly of complex III of the mitochondrial respiratory
chain.

CLONING

The S. cerevisiae bcs1 protein is a constituent of the inner
mitochondrial membrane and is required for the expression of functional
ubiquinol-cytochrome-c reductase (bc1) complex (see 191328). The bcs1
protein shares sequence similarity with members of the AAA (ATPases
associated with various cellular activities) superfamily (see 601681).
By searching an EST database for sequences related to bcs1, Petruzzella
et al. (1998) identified a cDNA encoding human BCS1L (BCS1-like). The
predicted 420-amino acid human protein is 50% identical to yeast bcs1
and, like bcs1, contains 2 conserved nucleotide-binding motifs. Although
BCS1L does not contain an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence,
in vitro mitochondrial import and trypsin-protection assays demonstrated
that it is imported into mitochondria. Northern blot analysis revealed
that BCS1L is expressed ubiquitously as a 1.4-kb mRNA. The authors also
detected a 4.5-kb transcript that they considered to be either an
alternative BCS1L mRNA or an mRNA derived from a related gene.

GENE FUNCTION

Found within the inner mitochondrial membrane, BCS1L is presumed to
facilitate insertion of Rieske Fe/S protein into precursors to complex
III during assembly of the respiratory chain (Cruciat et al., 1999).
Complex III then becomes assembled with complexes IV and I into a
respirasome supercomplex that facilitates the electron transfer required
for the synthesis of ATP.

MAPPING

Based on sequence similarity to ESTs, Petruzzella et al. (1998)
tentatively mapped the BCS1L gene to 2q33.

GENE STRUCTURE

De Lonlay et al. (2001) showed that the BCS1L gene consists of 7 exons.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Mitochondrial Complex III Deficiency, Nuclear Type 1

De Lonlay et al. (2001) found 4 biallelic mutations in the BCS1L gene in
6 patients from 4 families with mitochondrial complex III deficiency
nuclear type 1 (MC3DN1; 124000) characterized by neonatal proximal
tubulopathy, hepatic involvement, and encephalopathy. Complementation
studies in yeast confirmed the deleterious effect of these missense
mutations. De Lonlay et al. (2001) suggested that mutation of BCS1L is a
frequent cause of complex III deficiency, as one-third of their Turkish
patients had mutations in the BSC1L gene. De Lonlay et al. (2001)
reported that they had not been able to detect BCS1L mutations in
complex III-deficient patients with clinical presentations other than
neonatal tubulopathy with hepatic involvement and encephalopathy.

- GRACILE Syndrome

The GRACILE (growth retardation, amino aciduria, cholestasis, iron
overload, lactic acidosis, and early death) syndrome (603358) belongs to
the disease heritage of Finland. All affected families carry the same
ancestral haplotype on 2q33-q37, indicating 1 founder mutation (Visapaa
et al., 1998). Visapaa et al. (2002) identified a homozygous
ser78-to-gly mutation (S78G; 603358.0005) in the BCS1L gene in all
Finnish patients with GRACILE syndrome studied. In addition, they
identified 5 different mutations in the BCS1L gene in 3 British infants,
previously reported by Morris et al. (1995), whose symptoms resembled
those in GRACILE syndrome but who also had complex III deficiency and
neurologic symptoms. The phenotype of the Turkish patients in whom de
Lonlay et al. (2001) demonstrated mutations in the BCS1L gene was
distinctly different from that of the Finnish patients. Whereas the
Turkish patients had complex III deficiency, the Finnish patients had
complex III activity within the normal range. The Finnish patients had
no neurologic problems, but had marked hepatic iron overload, associated
with abnormal levels of proteins involved in iron transfer and storage,
and free plasma iron. These findings implied that BCS1L has another
cellular function that is uncharacterized but essential, and that it is
putatively involved in iron metabolism.

- Bjornstad Syndrome

Bjornstad syndrome (262000) is an autosomal recessive condition
characterized by sensorineural hearing loss and pili torti. Lubianca
Neto et al. (1998) mapped the Bjornstad syndrome locus to 2q34-q36.
Hinson et al. (2007) refined the map location of the disorder to 2q35
and demonstrated mutations in the BCS1L gene (e.g., 603647.0001).

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

To understand how BCS2L mutations cause such widely different clinical
phenotypes, Hinson et al. (2007) considered the locations of defects on
the BCS1L protein structure and compared the function of mutant BCS1L in
yeast and in human lymphocytes. Their studies showed that all BCS1L
mutations disrupted the assembly of mitochondrial respirasomes (the
basic unit of respiration in human mitochondria), but the clinical
severity of the mutations was correlated with the production of reactive
oxygen species. The data indicated that in addition to mitochondrial
heteroplasmy and variable energy requirements of tissues,
tissue-specific sensitivities to reactive oxygen species contribute to
the variability of the manifestations of mitochondrial defects.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX III DEFICIENCY, NUCLEAR TYPE 1
BCS1L, SER277ASN

In 2 affected sibs and 1 fetus in a consanguineous family with
mitochondrial complex III deficiency nuclear type 1 (MC3DN1; 124000)
characterized by neonatal tubulopathy, encephalopathy, and liver
failure, de Lonlay et al. (2001) identified a homozygous 830G-A
transition in the BCS1L gene, resulting in a ser277-to-asp (S277N)
substitution.

.0002
LEIGH SYNDROME DUE TO MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX III DEFICIENCY
BCS1L, PRO99LEU

In 2 patients with complex III deficiency (124000), a boy and a girl,
born to unrelated consanguineous families, de Lonlay et al. (2001)
identified the same homozygous C-to-T transition at nucleotide 296 in
exon 1 of the BCS1L gene, causing the substitution of a leucine for a
highly conserved proline at codon 99 (P99L). The patients had metabolic
acidosis, hepatic involvement, neurologic deterioration, and brainstem
and basal ganglia lesions consistent with a diagnosis of Leigh syndrome
(256000). One patient had abnormal ventilation patterns and proximal
renal tubulopathy.

.0003
MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX III DEFICIENCY, NUCLEAR TYPE 1
BCS1L, ARG155PRO

In a boy of Turkish origin with complex III deficiency (124000) born to
nonconsanguineous parents, de Lonlay et al. (2001) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the BCS1L gene: a 464C-G transversion
in exon 3 of the BCS1L gene, resulting in an arg155-to-pro (R155P)
substitution, and a 1057G-A transition in exon 7, resulting in a
val353-to-met (V353M; 603647.0004) substitution.

GRACILE SYNDROME
BCS1L, SER78GLY

Visapaa et al. (2002) reported that all GRACILE syndrome (603358)
patients in Finland were homozygous for a 232A-G mutation in exon 2 of
the BCS1L gene, resulting in a ser78-to-gly (S78G) substitution. Unlike
the Turkish patients reported by de Lonlay et al. (2001), the Finnish
patients had normal complex III activity and no neurologic problems, but
did have marked iron overload.

.0006
MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX III DEFICIENCY, NUCLEAR TYPE 1
BCS1L, ARG45CYS

In 2 Spanish sibs with fatal infantile complex III deficiency (124000),
De Meirleir et al. (2003) identified compound heterozygosity for
mutation in the BCS1L gene: a 246C-T transition in exon 1, resulting in
an arg45-to-cys (R45C) substitution, and a 279C-T transition in exon 1,
resulting in an arg56-to-ter (R56X; 603647.0007) substitution. The R45C
substitution occurs in a crucial targeting signal of the gene and is
predicted to interfere with proper protein functioning. Each parent was
heterozygous for 1 of the mutations. Both patients had severe metabolic
acidosis noted shortly after birth, as well as severe liver dysfunction
and a renal tubulopathy. One died at age 3 weeks of lactic acidosis. The
second infant also had obvious neurologic involvement, with delayed
myelination, axial hypotonia, and developmental delay. He died at age 3
months. Postmortem liver examination of both infants showed liver
fibrosis, severe cholestasis, and hepatosiderosis with accumulation of
iron in aggregates of macrophages and in Kupffer cells. Mitochondria
appeared enlarged with few or no cristae and a fluffy matrix. De
Meirleir et al. (2003) suggested that the iron accumulation could be
explained by the lack of incorporation of iron in the iron-sulfur
cluster of complex III.

Ramos-Arroyo et al. (2009) reported another Spanish infant with the R45C
and R56X mutations. She presented with neonatal severe hypotonia, food
intolerance, and vomiting. She soon developed a proximal renal
tubulopathy with glucosuria, phosphaturia, and aminoaciduria, metabolic
lactic acidosis, and hepatic involvement. Bilateral cataracts were also
noted. At age 4 months, she showed nystagmus, hypertonia, microcephaly,
developmental delay, and failure to thrive. Her neurologic condition and
metabolic acidosis worsened rapidly, and she died at 6 months of age.
Biochemical studies of muscle tissue showed impaired activity of
mitochondrial complex III. Ramos-Arroyo et al. (2009) noted that this
child did not have evidence of altered iron metabolism, as had been
observed in the patients reported by De Meirleir et al. (2003), and as
has been observed in patients with the allelic disorder GRACILE syndrome
(603358). Ramos-Arroyo et al. (2009) postulated that phenotypic
variability even in individuals with the same BCS1L genotype may reflect
tissue-specific expression of the mutant gene.

BJORNSTAD SYNDROME
BCS1L, ARG183HIS

In affected members of the family with Bjornstad syndrome (262000) in
which Lubianca Neto et al. (1998) demonstrated linkage to 2q, Hinson et
al. (2007) identified homozygosity for a C-to-T transition in the BCS1L
gene, resulting in an arg183-to-his (R183H) substitution. Eight
individuals in 2 sibships related as first cousins once removed were
affected; the parents in each case were consanguineous.

BJORNSTAD SYNDROME WITH MILD MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX III DEFICIENCY
MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX III DEFICIENCY, NUCLEAR TYPE 1, INCLUDED
BCS1L, ARG184CYS

In a sporadic case of Bjornstad syndrome (262000) with mild
mitochondrial complex III deficiency (124000), Hinson et al. (2007)
found compound heterozygosity for 2 missense mutations in the BCS1L
gene: arg184 to cys (R184C) and gly35 to arg (G35R; 603647.0010).

In a Moroccan girl with mitochondrial complex III deficiency (124000),
Fernandez-Vizarra et al. (2007) identified compound heterozygosity for
the R184C mutation and a 547C-T transition in exon 3 of the BCS1L gene,
resulting in an arg183-to-cys (R183C; 603647.0012) substitution. She
presented at age 9 months with acute psychomotor regression, hypotonia,
and failure to thrive, which progressed to spastic quadriparesis and
mental retardation associated with abnormal signal intensities in the
thalami, basal ganglia, and periventricular white matter, consistent
with an encephalopathy. Heart, liver, and kidneys were apparently
unaffected, but she was also noted to have brittle hair. Studies in
yeast showed that both mutations significantly reduced mitochondrial
cytochrome content and respiratory activity, as well as caused a
decreased incorporation of the Rieske iron-sulfur protein (UQCRFS1;
191327) into complex III. Further studies showed decreased levels of
fully assembled complex III. The findings suggested that BCS1L is
necessary for proper complex III assembly.

In a 4-year-old Spanish boy with isolated mitochondrial complex III
deficiency (124000), Blazquez et al. (2009) identified a homozygous
148A-G transition in exon 1 of the BCS1L gene, resulting in a
thr50-to-ala (T50A) substitution in the mitochondrial sorting sequence.
He presented at 6 months of age with psychomotor retardation, failure to
thrive, hypotonia, lactic acidosis, and hepatic dysfunction. Physical
examination showed unstable head support, poor eye fixation, coarse
facies, and epicanthus. There was hypertrichosis of the frontal head
zone and limbs, and excessive fat distribution in the upper back, neck,
hands and feet, with almost no fat on the limbs. Respiratory chain
activity in muscle and fibroblasts showed an isolated complex III defect
(58% of normal in muscle, 93% in fibroblasts). At age 4 years, he still
showed psychomotor retardation, had developed mild sensorineural hearing
loss, and persistent lactic acidemia, but renal function, hair, and iron
metabolism were normal. Brain MRI was normal. The mutation was not found
in 400 control alleles, and each unaffected parent was heterozygous for
the mutation.

162096	TITLE *162096 MIDKINE; MDK
;;MIDGESTATION AND KIDNEY; MK;;
NEURITE GROWTH-PROMOTING FACTOR 2, FORMERLY; NEGF2, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Midkine is a retinoic acid-responsive, heparin-binding growth factor
expressed in various cell types during embryogenesis. It promotes
angiogenesis, cell growth, and cell migration. Midkine is also expressed
in several carcinomas, suggesting that it may play a role in
tumorigenesis, perhaps through its effects on angiogenesis (summary by
Reynolds et al., 2004).

CLONING

Using mouse Mk to screen a midgestation human embryonic kidney cDNA
library, followed by screening a placenta genomic library, Tsutsui et
al. (1991) cloned human MDK, which they called MK. The deduced 121-amino
acid protein has a signal sequence and shares 87% identity with mouse
Mk. Orthologs of MK were detected in rat, cow, and chicken. The chicken
ortholog, Rihb, is a retinoic acid-induced heparin-binding protein. MK
shares about 50% amino acid homology with the human heparin-binding
protein pleiotrophin (PTN; 162095), with highest conservation in the
central part of the molecule and complete conservation of cysteine
residues. Northern blot analysis detected a transcript of about 1 kb in
adult human kidney and PA1 human teratocarcinoma cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Reynolds et al. (2004) found that hypoxia induced midkine expression in
alveolar epithelial cells and pulmonary vasculature in a strain of mice
sensitive to hypoxia. Hypoxia induced expression of both HIF1-alpha
(603348) and midkine in human placental adenocarcinoma, mouse fetal lung
mesenchyme, and human pulmonary adenocarcinoma cell lines. HIF1-alpha
induced midkine expression via regulatory elements in the mouse midkine
promoter. Chronic expression of midkine during embryonic development in
transgenic mice resulted in pulmonary arterial remodeling and
muscularization, but only during the postnatal phase of lung
development. In fetal mouse lung mesenchymal cells and transgenic mice,
midkine upregulated expression of myocardin (MYOCD; 606127), a regulator
of smooth muscle cell differentiation.

Intraperitoneal adhesions between organs or between organs and
peritoneal walls occur in more than 90% of cases involving major
abdominal operations. Using a model of postoperative adhesions and
Mk-null mice, Inoh et al. (2004) showed that midkine was fundamentally
involved in the formation of intraperitoneal adhesions, at least partly
by promoting migration of macrophages and neutrophils to the omentum.

Hobo et al. (2009) found that 5/6 nephrectomy in mice, a model of
chronic kidney disease, induced expression of midkine in lung, leading
to elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE; 106180) activity and
plasma angiotensin II (106150) levels and subsequent hypertension.
Exposure to midkine enhanced ACE expression in primary cultured human
lung microvascular endothelial cells. Oxidative stress may have
contributed to midkine expression, since 5/6 nephrectomy induced
expression of NADH/NADPH oxidase-1 (NOX1; 300225), Nox2 (CYBB; 300481),
and Nox4 (605261). Furthermore, an antioxidant reduced midkine
expression and plasma angiotensin II levels and ameliorated hypertension
in 5/6 nephrectomized mice.

GENE STRUCTURE

Uehara et al. (1992) determined that the MDK gene contains 4 exons. The
5-prime flanking region adjacent to the start site contains 5 GC boxes,
a steroid/thyroid hormone receptor-binding site, and an A/T-rich island,
but there is no obvious CAAT box. Further upstream there is a region
with high GC content. The mouse Mdk gene has a similar organization,
with conservation of exons and significant homology in the 5-prime
region adjacent to the start site. There are 3 additional regions of
homology between mouse and human MDK in the 5-prime UTR.

MAPPING

By study of somatic cell hybrids, Eddy et al. (1991) demonstrated that
the MDK gene segregates concordantly with chromosome 11 and, using cell
hybrids carrying translocations involving chromosome 11, they mapped the
gene regionally to 11p13-p11. Kaname et al. (1993) mapped the MDK gene
to human chromosome 11p11.2 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.
Simon-Chazottes et al. (1992) mapped the mouse Mdk gene to chromosome 2,
using an interspecific backcross panel and microsatellite polymorphisms
as markers. O'Hara et al. (1995) used somatic cell hybrid analysis and
interspecific backcross analysis, respectively, to map human Mdk to
chromosome 11p13-p11 and mouse Mdk to a syntenic region of mouse
chromosome 2. They also mapped an Mdk pseudogene to mouse chromosome 11.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using microarray analysis, Ezquerra et al. (2005) found that aortae of
Mk -/- mice showed elevated expression of renin (REN; 179820),
angiotensinogen (106150), angiotensin II receptor-1 (AGTR1; 106165), and
angiotensin II receptor-2 (AGTR2; 300034) and decreased expression of
Ace.

611334	TITLE *611334 SMALL NUCLEOLAR RNA, H/ACA BOX, 81; SNORA81
;;snoRNA, HBI-61
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs involved in RNA
processing. Box H/ACA snoRNAs, such as SNORA81, direct the conversion of
uridine to pseudouridine at specific residues of ribosomal RNAs or small
nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) (Gu et al., 2005).

CLONING

By RT-PCR of human blood total RNA, Gu et al. (2005) identified several
box H/ACA snoRNAs, including SNORA81, which they called HBI-61. HBI-61
contains 178 nucleotides and has 3 isoforms.

MAPPING

Gu et al. (2005) mapped the SNORA81 gene to chromosome 3, within intron
3 of the EIF2A gene (609234).

604634	TITLE *604634 TRANSGELIN 2; TAGLN2
DESCRIPTION By sequencing cDNAs randomly selected from a cDNA library derived from a
human immature myeloid cell line, Nagase et al. (1995) isolated a cDNA
encoding TAGLN2, which they called KIAA0120. The deduced 199-amino acid
TAGLN2 protein shares 69.7% amino acid sequence identity with rat
neuronal protein NP25 (607953) over 195 amino acids. Northern blot
analysis detected TAGLN2 expression in all 16 human tissues examined,
with high expression in lung, liver, kidney, spleen, thymus, small
intestine, colon, prostate, testis, ovary, placenta, and peripheral
blood leukocytes, lower expression in skeletal muscle, pancreas, and
heart, and lowest expression in brain.

Stanier et al. (1998) cloned mouse Tagln2 cDNAs. They found that mouse
and human TAGLN2 share 95% amino acid sequence identity.

Using a somatic cell hybrid mapping panel, Nagase et al. (1995)
determined that the TAGLN2 gene maps to either chromosome 1 or 8.
Stanier et al. (1998) noted that an EST cluster representing the TAGLN2
gene had been mapped to 1q21-q25. By linkage analysis, Stanier et al.
(1998) mapped the mouse Tagln2 gene to distal chromosome 1, between the
Fcgr2 gene (146790) and marker D1Mit149. Distal mouse chromosome 1 shows
homology of synteny with human 1q21-q25.

108732	TITLE *108732 ATPase, Ca(2+)-TRANSPORTING, PLASMA MEMBRANE, 4; ATP2B4
;;PLASMA MEMBRANE Ca(2+)-ATPase, TYPE 4; PMCA4;;
ATP2B2, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The Ca(2+)-ATPases are a family of plasma membrane pumps encoded by at
least 4 genes: ATP2B1 (108731) on chromosome 12q21; ATP2B2 (108733) on
3q26; ATP2B3 (300014) on Xq28; and ATP2B4.

CLONING

By PCR, Brandt et al. (1992) detected expression of the PMCA4a variant
in all tissues examined. They identified a second variant, PMCA4b, that
was primarily expressed in skeletal muscle, small intestine, heart,
spinal cord, and brain. Brandt et al. (1992) isolated the full-length
PMCA4b cDNA from a fetal brain cDNA library. The deduced 473-amino acid
protein lacks a large portion of the C terminus found in PMCA4a.

By RT-PCR, Santiago-Garcia et al. (1996) found variable expression of
the PMCA and SERCA (see 108730) genes during human fetal heart
development. PMCA4 and PMCA1 were expressed in 8-, 12-, and 20-week
fetal heart and in adult heart. Two PMCA4 splice variants were detected
in heart tissue, whereas only 1 was detected in placenta.

Okunade et al. (2004) examined Pmca1 and Pmca4 expression in mouse
tissues. Pmca1 was expressed in all tissues examined, and Pmca4 was
expressed in all tissues examined except liver. Pmca1 predominated in
brain, intestine, kidney, lung, and stomach, whereas Pmca4 predominated
in aorta, portal vein, bladder, diaphragm, seminal vesicles, and testis.
Immunostaining localized Pmca4 to the principal piece of the sperm tail,
the location of Catsper (606389), the major Ca(2+) channel required for
sperm motility.

MAPPING

Olson et al. (1991) mapped the PMCA4 gene to chromosome 1q25-q32 by
Southern analysis of human-rodent somatic cell hybrids, in situ
hybridization of human metaphase spreads, and genetic linkage analysis
in the CEPH pedigrees. No evidence was obtained for multiple copies of
the gene at this locus; however, a cross-hybridizing sequence was
detected on Xq13-qter at low stringency.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Associations Pending Confirmation

For discussion of a possible association between variation in the ATP2B4
gene and resistance to severe malaria, see 611162.

ANIMAL MODEL

Chen et al. (2004) expressed mouse Cd22 (107266) in mouse and chicken
B-cell lines devoid of Cd22 and examined B cells from mice deficient in
Cd22 or Pmca4. They identified an activation-dependent interaction
between phosphorylated Cd22 and Pmca4 and found that Cd22 together with
Shp1 (PTPN6; 176883) provided negative control of B-cell activation by
enhancing Pmca4-mediated calcium efflux after B-cell receptor
stimulation.

Okunade et al. (2004) found that loss of both copies of the mouse Pmca4
gene resulted in no overt phenotype. Loss of Pmca4 impaired phasic
contractions and caused apoptosis in portal vein smooth muscle in vitro,
but this phenotype was dependent on the mouse strain employed. On a
Black Swiss background, the phenotype was not expressed unless the mice
also carried a null mutation in 1 copy of the Pmca1 gene. Pmca4 -/- male
mice were infertile but had normal spermatogenesis and mating behavior.
Pmca4 -/- sperm that had not undergone capacitation exhibited normal
motility but did not achieve hyperactivated motility needed to traverse
the female genital tract. Ultrastructure of the motility apparatus of
mutant sperm tails showed mitochondrial condensation, indicating Ca(2+)
overload. Okunade et al. (2004) concluded that PMCA4 expression in the
principal piece of sperm tail is essential for hyperactivated motility
and male fertility.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

KLK8 belongs to the kallikrein subgroup of serine proteases, which have
diverse physiologic functions in many tissues. For background
information on kallikreins, see 147960.

CLONING

By searching an EST database, followed by PCR on hippocampus and
keratinocyte cDNA and RACE, Yoshida et al. (1998) isolated a cDNA
encoding KLK8, the human homolog of mouse neuropsin. The deduced
260-amino acid protein, 72% identical to the mouse sequence, has an
N-terminal signal peptide, conserved residues for protease activity, an
N-linked glycosylation site, and 13 cys residues. Northern blot analysis
detected a 0.9-kb transcript in keratinocytes.

Using a similar strategy, Mitsui et al. (1999) obtained cDNAs encoding
260- and 305-amino acid KLK8 isoforms, which they termed type-1 and
type-2 neuropsin, respectively. Sequence analysis determined that type 2
has a 45-residue leucine- and proline-rich insert at the C terminus of
the putative leader sequence of type 1. Mouse and human genomic sequence
analysis indicated that type 2 is a species-specific splice variant for
humans. Northern blot analysis revealed that type 1 is most intensely
expressed in pancreas, with lower expression in placenta, whereas type 2
is expressed in brain, suggesting organ-specific alternative splicing.
RT-PCR analysis detected type 2 expression in hippocampus. Dot blot
hybridization demonstrated expression of type 2 in all investigated
areas of the brain. Western blot analysis showed that type-1 and type-2
neuropsin are secreted as 35- and 38-kD proteins, respectively, from
insect cells.

By RT-PCR analysis using degenerate primers for serine proteases in
normal ovary and ovarian carcinoma, Underwood et al. (1999) identified a
cDNA encoding KLK8, which they called TADG14. Database searching showed
that TADG14 is identical to the 280-amino acid human neuropsin at the
protein but not the cDNA level. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.4-kb
transcript that was highly overexpressed in 20 of 30 ovarian carcinomas
studied. Western blot analysis detected a 30-kD protein in tumor cell
lines. Immunohistochemical analysis detected KLK8 in carcinoma but not
normal ovarian tissue. Underwood et al. (1999) suggested that
circulating KLK8 may be a useful marker for early detection of ovarian
carcinoma.

By RT-PCR of 35 adult and fetal tissues, Gan et al. (2000) detected
highest KLK8 expression in adult skin. Most other tissues showed weak
KLK8 expression.

Kishi et al. (2003) demonstrated K8 protein in ovarian cancer tissue
extracts, serum, and ascites fluid, suggesting that it may serve as a
new ovarian cancer marker.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Yoshida et al. (1998) determined that KLK8
is a single-copy gene that contains 6 exons and spans 5.4 kb. Promoter
analysis revealed atypical TATA and CCAAT box sequences.

GENE FUNCTION

Attwood et al. (2011) demonstrated in mice that the serine protease
neuropsin is critical for stress-related plasticity in the amygdala by
regulating the dynamics of the EphB2-NMDA receptor interaction, the
expression of Fkbp5 (602623), and anxiety-like behavior. Stress results
in neuropsin-dependent cleavage of EphB2 in the amygdala, causing
dissociation of EphB2 from the NR1 (138249) subunit of the NMDA receptor
and promoting membrane turnover of EphB2 receptors. Dynamic EphB2-NR1
interaction enhances NMDA receptor current, induces Fkpb5 gene
expression, and enhances behavioral signatures of anxiety. On stress,
neuropsin-deficient mice do not show EphB2 cleavage and its dissociation
from NR1, resulting in a static EphB2-NR1 interaction, attenuated
induction of the Fkbp5 gene, and low anxiety. The behavioral response to
stress can be restored by intraamygdala injection of neuropsin into
neuropsin-deficient mice and disrupted by the injection of either
anti-EphB2 antibodies or silencing the Fkbp5 gene in the amygdala of
wildtype mice. Attwood et al. (2011) concluded that their findings
established a novel neuronal pathway linking stress-induced proteolysis
of EphB2 in the amygdala to anxiety.

MAPPING

Harvey et al. (2000) mapped the KLK8 gene to chromosome 19q13.4 in the
KLK gene cluster between KLK7 (604438) and KLK9 (605504). They noted
that KLK5 (605643) to KLK14 are transcribed telomere to centromere.

EVOLUTION

Lu et al. (2007) demonstrated that type-2 KLK8 is absent from nonhuman
primates, indicating that it is human specific. In vitro splicing assays
revealed a human-specific mutation that triggers the change in splicing
pattern, and mutation assays showed that this mutation is necessary and
sufficient for type-2 KLK8 expression.

603167	TITLE *603167 BCL2 ANTAGONIST OF CELL DEATH; BAD
;;BCL2-BINDING PROTEIN; BCL2L8;;
BCL2-BINDING COMPONENT 6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Protein interactions among different pro- and antiapoptotic members of
the BCL2 (151430) family are central to their regulation of apoptosis.
These interactions are chiefly influenced by alpha-helical segments
known as BCL2 homology (BH) domains. Some proapoptotic and all
antiapoptotic BCL2 family members share homology within 3 to 4 BH
domains, whereas the BH3-only proapoptotic proteins share homology
within a single BH3 domain. BAD is a BH3-only protein that alternately
functions in apoptosis and metabolism depending upon the availability of
growth factors and nutrients. The switch between apoptotic and metabolic
functions of BAD is controlled by phosphorylation (summary by Danial,
2009).

CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of a mouse embryonic cDNA fusion library,
Yang et al. (1995) obtained a cDNA encoding a novel Bcl2-binding
protein, termed Bad for 'Bcl2 antagonist of cell death.' The 204-amino
acid murine protein has sequence similarity to members of the BCL2
family within the BH1 and BH2 domains.

Wang et al. (1996) used PCR based on EST sequences to clone a fragment
of the human BAD cDNA.

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to mouse Bad,
followed by screening substantia nigra, bone marrow, and placenta cDNA
libraries, Ottilie et al. (1997) cloned full-length human BAD. The
deduced 168-amino acid protein shares 74% identity with mouse Bad, but
it lacks 42 N-terminal amino acids found in the mouse protein. Ottilie
et al. (1997) noted that the met start codon of human BAD satisfies
Kozak criteria, and that no human BAD variants encoding an N-terminally
extended protein were identified. Alignment of BAD with other BCL2
family proteins revealed a single putative BH3 domain.

GENE FUNCTION

Yang et al. (1995) found that mouse Bad heterodimerized strongly with
Bclx (600039) and less strongly with Bcl2, but it did not bind to other
members of the family. At similar levels of expression, Bad countered
the death repressor activity of Bclx, but not that of Bcl2. Functional
studies revealed that when Bad dimerized with Bclx, it displaced Bax
(600040) and restored its apoptosis-inducing ability. The authors
suggested that BAD may influence the effectiveness of BCL2 versus BCLX
in repressing cell death.

Wang et al. (1996) showed that the human BAD protein was phosphorylated
by the protein kinase RAF1 (164760), which had been targeted by BCL2 to
the mitochondrial membrane.

Using yeast 2-hybrid and solid-phase binding assays, Ottilie et al.
(1997) showed that human BAD dimerized strongly with the long BCLX
isoform (BCLXL) and more weakly with BCL2. BAD did not bind the short
BCLX isoform (BCLXS), BAX, or BAK (600516), and it did not homodimerize.
Competition studies revealed that the BH3 domains of BAD, BCLXL, and
BCL2 were required for heterodimerization. BAD increased the number of
apoptotic cells when transfected into human HEK293 cells, and it
cancelled the prosurvival effect of BCLXL in GM701 human fibroblasts.

Bonni et al. (1999) characterized the mechanism by which the RAS (see
190020)-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway (see
602448) mediates growth factor-dependent cell survival. The
MAP-activated kinases, the Rsks (see 300075), catalyzed the
phosphorylation of the proapoptotic protein BAD at ser112 both in vitro
and in vivo. The Rsk-induced phosphorylation of BAD at ser112 suppressed
BAD-mediated apoptosis in neurons.

Danial et al. (2003) undertook a proteomic analysis to assess whether
BAD might participate in mitochondrial physiology. In liver
mitochondria, BAD resides in a functional holoenzyme complex together
with protein kinase A (see 176911) and protein phosphatase-1 (PP1; see
176875) catalytic units, WAVE1 (605035) as an A kinase-anchoring
protein, and glucokinase (138079). Using mitochondria from hepatocytes
of Bad-deficient mice, Danial et al. (2003) demonstrated that BAD is
required to assemble the complex, the lack of which results in
diminished mitochondria-based glucokinase activity and blunted
mitochondrial respiration in response to glucose. Glucose deprivation
results in dephosphorylation of BAD, and BAD-dependent cell death.
Moreover, Danial et al. (2003) demonstrated that the phosphorylation
status of BAD helps regulate glucokinase activity. Mice deficient in BAD
or bearing a nonphosphorylatable BAD (3SA) mutant (Datta et al., 2002)
display abnormal glucose homeostasis, including profound defects in
glucose tolerance. Danial et al. (2003) concluded that this combination
of proteomics, genetics, and physiology indicates an unanticipated role
for BAD in integrating pathways of glucose metabolism and apoptosis.

- Reviews

Danial (2009) reviewed the roles of BAD in apoptosis and metabolism, as
well as its regulation by phosphorylation.

MAPPING

Gross (2010) mapped the BAD gene to chromosome 11q13.1 based on an
alignment of the BAD sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB451254) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

ANIMAL MODEL

Ranger et al. (2003) reported that Bad-deficient mice lacking both long
and short Bad proteins were viable, and most cell types appeared to
develop normally. Lymphocytes developed normally with no premalignant
hyperplasia, but they displayed subtle abnormalities in proliferation
and IgG production. Despite the minimal phenotype, Bad-deficient mice
progressed, with aging, to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of germinal
center origin. Exposure of Bad-null mice to sublethal gamma irradiation
resulted in an increased incidence of pre-T-cell and pro-/pre-B-cell
lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma. Thus, proapoptotic BAD suppresses
tumorigenesis in the lymphocyte lineage.

609080	TITLE *609080 F-BOX AND LEUCINE-RICH REPEAT PROTEIN 13; FBXL13
;;FBL13
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the F-box protein family, such as FBXL13, are characterized
by an approximately 40-amino acid F-box motif. SCF complexes, formed by
SKP1 (601434), cullin (see CUL1; 603134), and F-box proteins, act as
protein-ubiquitin ligases. F-box proteins interact with SKP1 through the
F box, and they interact with ubiquitination targets through other
protein interaction domains (Jin et al., 2004).

CLONING

Jin et al. (2004) reported that the human FBXL13 protein contains an
N-terminal F box, followed by a tandem array of 4 leucine-rich repeats,
a short spacer, and a second tandem array of 7 leucine-rich repeats.

By Northern blot analysis, Curtiss et al. (2005) identified 2 FBXL13
mRNA splice variants in a leukemia cell line. A message of about 1.6 kb
encodes a protein with an F-box domain and 5 leucine-rich repeats, and a
message of about 2.3 kb encodes a protein with an F-box domain and 12
leucine-rich repeats.

GENE STRUCTURE

Curtiss et al. (2005) determined that the FBXL13 gene contains 19 exons
and spans 261 kb.

MAPPING

Jin et al. (2004) stated that the FBXL13 gene maps to chromosome 7q22.1
and the mouse Fbxl13 gene maps to chromosome 5A3.

604471	TITLE *604471 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 1 (GLUTAMATE TRANSPORTER), MEMBER 7; SLC1A7
;;EXCITATORY AMINO ACID TRANSPORTER 5; EAAT5;;
GLUTAMATE TRANSPORTER, RETINA
DESCRIPTION The uptake of glutamate and other excitatory amino acids is mediated by
a family of high-affinity sodium-dependent transporters, the excitatory
amino acid transporters (EAATs). The transport of glutamate is driven by
the cotransport of sodium ions and the countertransport of potassium
ions down their electrochemical gradients, and studies have suggested
that this complex process involves the cotransport of protons as well.
In addition to these transport currents, an uncoupled passive flux of
chloride ions has been detected. The relative magnitude of this
associated chloride conductance varies with each transporter subtype. A
glutamate-dependent current that has a transporter-like pharmacology is
carried largely by chloride ions in retinal cone and rod photoreceptors
and bipolar cells. By screening a human retina cDNA library with a
salamander retina cDNA encoding a glutamate transporter associated with
a large chloride conductance, Arriza et al. (1997) identified SLC1A7,
which they called EAAT5. They isolated an EAAT5 cDNA encoding a deduced
560-amino acid protein containing 8 putative transmembrane domains and a
single potential N-linked glycosylation site in the putative large
extracellular loop. Although EAAT5 shares the structural homologies of
the EAAT family, 1 novel feature of the EAAT5 sequence is a C-terminal
motif previously identified in N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and
potassium channels and shown to confer interactions with a family of
synaptic proteins that promote ion channel clustering. EAAT5 has 46%
amino acid sequence identity with EAAT1 (SLC1A3; 600111), 43% identity
with EAAT4 (SLC1A6; 600637), 37% identity with EAAT3 (SLC1A1; 133550),
and 36% identity with EAAT2 (SLC1A2; 600300). Arriza et al. (1997)
measured the functional properties of EAAT5 in a Xenopus oocyte
expression system by measuring radiolabeled glutamate flux and
2-electrode voltage clamp recording. EAAT5-mediated L-glutamate uptake
was sodium- and voltage-dependent and chloride-independent. Transporter
currents elicited by glutamate were also sodium- and voltage-dependent,
but ion substitution experiments suggested that this current was largely
carried by chloride ions. Northern blot analysis of 8 human tissues
detected a major 3.1-kb EAAT5 transcript that was abundantly expressed
only in retina. Arriza et al. (1997) concluded that the properties of
EAAT5 are similar to the glutamate-elicited chloride conductances
described in retinal neurons, suggesting that the EAAT5-associated
chloride conductance may participate in visual processing.

;;HERPESVIRUS ENTRY MEDIATOR C; HVEC;;
POLIOVIRUS RECEPTOR-RELATED 1; PVRR1;;
PVRR; PRR;;
NECTIN 1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PVRL1, or nectin-1, belongs to the nectin subfamily of
immunoglobulin-like adhesion molecules that participate in
Ca(2+)-independent cell-cell adhesion. Nectins bind to the actin
cytoskeleton through the adaptor protein afadin (MLLT4; 159559) and are
key components of adherens junctions (summary by Barron et al. (2008)).

CLONING

Members of the immunoglobin (Ig) superfamily have been shown to serve as
receptors for various viruses. The human poliovirus receptor (PVR;
173850) is an integral membrane protein with one V-like extracellular Ig
domain, 2 C-like extracellular Ig domains, a transmembrane region, and
an intracytoplasmic region. Lopez et al. (1995) isolated a cDNA for a
poliovirus receptor related gene, which they symbolized PRR. The
predicted protein is 518 amino acids long and has a domain structure
similar to PVR. In the extracellular domain, PRR is nearly 52% identical
to PVR and 54% identical to the murine homolog of PVR. Northern blots
showed a major 5.9-kb mRNA in all tissues tested.

GENE FUNCTION

Using the Don Chinese hamster line, Carritt and Goldfarb (1976) found
that susceptibility to herpesvirus is determined by a gene on chromosome
3. Francke and Francke (1979) used a V79 line and concluded that human
chromosome 11 is responsible for susceptibility; Don and V79 did not
complement.

Geraghty et al. (1998) showed that poliovirus receptor-related protein-1
mediated entry of several alphaherpesviruses, including herpes simplex
viruses (HSV) 1 and 2, porcine pseudorabies virus (PRV), and bovine
herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1) into cells. The poliovirus receptor itself
mediated entry of PRV and BHV-1, but not of the HSV strains tested by
Geraghty et al. (1998). They found that PVRR1 was expressed in human
cells of epithelial and neuronal origin and concluded that it is a prime
candidate for the coreceptor that allows both HSV-1 and HSV-2 to infect
epithelial cells on mucosal surfaces and spread to cells of the nervous
system.

Using immunolocalization of adult mouse hippocampal sections Mizoguchi
et al. (2002) found that the nectin-afadin system colocalizes with the
cadherin (see 192090)-catenin (see 116805) system at synapses between
mossy fiber terminals and dendrites of pyramidal cells in the CA3 area.
Nectins-1 and -3 (PVRL3; 607147) asymmetrically localize at the pre- and
postsynaptic sides of puncta adherentia junctions, respectively. During
development, nectins-1 and -3 asymmetrically localize not only at puncta
adherentia junctions but also at synaptic junctions. Using rat
hippocampal neurons in culture, Mizoguchi et al. (2002) observed that
inhibition of the nectin-based adhesion results in a decrease in synapse
size and a concomitant increase in synapse number.

Togashi et al. (2011) found that mouse hair cells and supporting cells
express the immunoglobulin-like adhesion molecules nectin-1 and -3,
respectively, and that their interaction mediates the heterotypic
adhesion between these 2 cell types. Genetic removal of nectin-1 or -3
disrupted the checkerboard-like pattern, inducing aberrant attachment
between hair cells. When cells expressing either nectin-1 or -3 were
cocultured, they arranged themselves into a mosaic pattern. Thus,
Togashi et al. (2011) concluded that nectin-1 and nectin-3 promote the
formation of the checkerboard-like pattern of the auditory epithelia.

MAPPING

Lopez et al. (1995) mapped the PVRR gene to 11q23-q24 by in situ
hybridization.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The cleft lip/palate-ectodermal dysplasia syndrome (CLPED1; 225060),
which has been called both Zlotogora-Ogur syndrome and Margarita Island
ectodermal dysplasia, is characterized clinically by cleft lip/palate,
hidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, developmental defects of the hands, and,
in some cases, mental retardation. Although generally rare, CLPED1
occurs with a frequency of approximately 1 per 2,000 among the
indigenous population of Margarita Island, in whom Suzuki et al. (1998)
assigned the CLPED1 locus to 11q23 by linkage mapping. Suzuki et al.
(2000) genotyped markers spanning the CLPED1 interval in an inbred
Israeli family with a diagnosis of Zlotogora-Ogur syndrome. The proband
was homozygous and the first-cousin parents heterozygous for all markers
tested, but with a different disease-associated haplotype than in
Margarita Island families, consistent with allelism between Margarita
Island and Israeli CLPED1. Suzuki et al. (2000) followed a positional
cloning approach to identify the CLPED1 gene as PVRL1, encoding
nectin-1, an immunoglobulin-related transmembrane cell-cell adhesion
molecule that is part of the NAP cell adhesion system. Nectin-1 is also
the principal cell surface receptor for alpha-herpesviruses (Geraghty et
al., 1998). Suzuki et al. (2000) speculated that the high frequency of
CLPED1 on Margarita Island in the Caribbean Sea might have resulted from
resistance of heterozygotes to infection by these viruses.

In Margarita Island CLPED1 patients, Suzuki et al. (2000) identified a
nonsense mutation (W185X; 600644.0001) in the PVRL1 gene.

Sozen et al. (2001) demonstrated a highly significant association
between heterozygosity for the W185X mutation and sporadic, nonsyndromic
cleft lip with or without cleft palate (see 225060) in northern
Venezuela.

ANIMAL MODEL

Barron et al. (2008) found that nectin-1 -/- mice were viable and
fertile, but manifested microphthalmia and defective amelogenesis of
their incisor teeth. Nectin-1 -/- incisors lacked the normal iron
pigmentation characteristic of rodent enamel and were prone to wear and
breakage. Immunohistochemical analysis of wildtype mice showed nectin-1
staining at the interface between the maturation-stage ameloblasts and
the underlying cells of the stratum intermedium. In the absence of
nectin-1, these cell layers were separated. Numerous large desmosomes
were present at this interface in wildtype mice; however, where adhesion
persisted in nectin-1 -/- mice, the desmosomes were smaller and less
numerous. Barron et al. (2008) concluded that nectin-1 participates in
desmosome assembly.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CLEFT LIP/PALATE-ECTODERMAL DYSPLASIA SYNDROME
OROFACIAL CLEFT 7, INCLUDED
PVRL1, TRP185TER

In Margarita Island CLPED1 patients (225060), Suzuki et al. (2000)
identified a nonsense mutation of codon trp185 (TGG to TAG) in the PVRL1
gene.

Sozen et al. (2001) demonstrated a highly significant association
between heterozygosity for the W185X mutation and nonsyndromic, sporadic
cleft lip with or without cleft palate (see 119530) in northern
Venezuela. In the Cumana region of northern Venezuela, 14 (5.8%) of 243
individuals with cleft lip with or without cleft palate carried this
mutation, versus 1 of 245 controls (0.4%) (p = 0.00039).

.0002
CLEFT LIP/PALATE-ECTODERMAL DYSPLASIA SYNDROME
PVRL1, 1-BP DEL

In an Israeli family with cleft lip/palate-ectodermal dysplasia (225060)
reported by Zlotogora et al. (1987), Suzuki et al. (2000) identified
deletion of 1 guanine from codon 185 (trp) of the PVRL1 gene, converting
TGG to T-G and resulting in a frameshift. Notably this involved the same
codon as was involved in a nonsense mutation in the Margarita Island
CLEPD1 patients (600644.0001).

.0003
CLEFT LIP/PALATE-ECTODERMAL DYSPLASIA SYNDROME
PVRL1, 1-BP DUP

In a Brazilian family with CLEPD1 (225060), Suzuki et al. (2000)
identified a single-base duplication in codon gly323 of the PVRL1 gene
(GGT to GGTT), resulting in frameshift.

125305	TITLE *125305 ERYTHROCYTE MEMBRANE PROTEIN BAND 4.9; EPB49
;;DEMATIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Dematin, or EPB49, is an actin-bundling protein originally identified in
the erythroid membrane skeleton. Its actin-bundling activity is
abolished upon phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and is
restored after dephosphorylation (Rana et al., 1993).

CLONING

Chishti et al. (1989) proposed the name dematin (from the Greek 'dema,'
a bundle) for an actin-bundling protein identified in the human
erythroid membrane skeleton. Rana et al. (1993) noted that dematin
consists of 2 polypeptide chains of 48 and 52 kD that were identified as
protein 4.9 on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. In solution, dematin exists as a
trimer and bundles actin filaments in a phosphorylation-dependent
manner. Rana et al. (1993) cloned dematin from a human reticulocyte cDNA
library. The deduced 383-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of 43 kD. Dematin has a polyglutamine motif that may constitute a
nuclear localization signal, a PEST sequence, a C-terminal domain highly
similar to the C-terminal headpiece domain of villin (VIL; 193040), and
several putative phosphorylation sites. Northern blot analysis detected
variable dematin expression in all tissues examined. Immunofluorescence
microscopy revealed punctate dematin staining around the cell nucleus in
cultured human erythroblasts.

Although dematin is an actin-bundling protein of the erythroid membrane
skeleton, it is abundantly expressed in human brain, heart, skeletal
muscle, kidney, and lung. Azim et al. (1995) reported the primary
structure of the 52-kD subunit of dematin, which differs from the 48-kD
subunit by a 22-amino acid insertion within its headpiece domain. A
unique feature of the insertion sequence of the 52-kD subunit is its
homology to erythrocyte protein 4.2 (177070).

GENE FUNCTION

Rana et al. (1993) confirmed that purified human dematin possessed
actin-bundling activity in vitro. Protease treatment and microsequencing
revealed that the C-terminal headpiece domain bound actin filaments, but
it did not have actin-bundling activity.

Azim et al. (1996) demonstrated that dematin and protein 4.2 bound ATP.

Gilligan and Bennett (1993) provided a review.

MAPPING

Using somatic cell hybrid panels and fluorescence in situ hybridization,
Azim et al. (1995) localized the dematin gene to chromosome 8p21.1, a
site distal to the locus of ankyrin (612641) at chromosome 8p11.2.

Peters et al. (1995) demonstrated that the murine dematin gene,
symbolized Epb4.9, maps to chromosome 14. They raised the possibility
that dematin mutations may be involved in neurologic abnormalities in
the mouse.

ANIMAL MODEL

By using homologous recombination in mouse embryonic stem cells, Khanna
et al. (2002) deleted the headpiece domain of dematin to evaluate its
function in vivo. Dematin headpiece-null mice were viable and born at
the expected mendelian ratio. Hematologic evaluation showed evidence of
compensated anemia and spherocytosis in these mice, however. The
headpiece-null erythrocytes were osmotically fragile, and displayed
reduced deformability and filterability. In vitro, significantly greater
membrane fragmentation of these erythrocytes was demonstrated.
Biochemical characterization showed a weakened membrane skeleton
evidenced by reduced association of spectrin and actin to the plasma
membrane. Together, these results provided evidence for the physiologic
significance of dematin and demonstrated a role for the headpiece domain
in the maintenance of structural integrity and mechanical properties of
red cells in vivo.

Chen et al. (2007) created double-knockout mice lacking beta-adducin
(ADD2; 102681) and the headpiece domain of dematin. Double-knockout pups
were pale compared with wildtype pups, but otherwise they appeared
grossly normal. Peripheral blood analysis showed severe hemolytic anemia
with reduced number of erythrocytes/hematocrit/hemoglobin and an
approximately 12-fold increase in the number of circulating
reticulocytes. The presence of a variety of misshapen and fragmented
erythrocytes correlated with increased osmotic fragility and reduced in
vivo life span. Mutant erythrocyte membranes showed weak retention of
spectrin-actin complexes, increased grain size, decreased filament
number, and features consistent with the presence of large protein
aggregates. Chen et al. (2007) concluded that dematin and adducin are
essential for the maintenance of erythrocyte shape and membrane
stability.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database analysis, followed by PCR of a human kidney cDNA library,
Wang et al. (2005) cloned SPSB2, which they called SSB2. The deduced
263-amino acid protein shares 50% amino acid identity with SPSB1
(611657). SPSB2 contains a central SPRY domain and a C-terminal SOCS
box. Coimmunoprecipitation studies showed that SPSB2 interacted with MET
(164860).

613565	TITLE *613565 UBIQUITINATION FACTOR E4B; UBE4B
;;UFD2, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF, A; UFD2A;;
KIAA0684
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Ishikawa et al. (1998) cloned UBE4B, which they designated
KIAA0684. The deduced 903-amino acid protein shares weak similarity with
Dictyostelium NOSA, a developmental regulator involved in proteasomal
degradation of ubiquitinated proteins (Koegl et al., 1999). See also
UBE4A, 603753. Using RT-PCR, Ishikawa et al. (1998) found uniformly high
KIAA0684 expression in all 10 human tissues examined. In vitro
translation resulted in a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 92
kD by SDS-PAGE.

Kaneko et al. (2003) cloned mouse Ube4b, which they called Ufd2a, from
testis and T cell cDNA libraries. The deduced 1,174-amino acid protein
has a C-terminal U-box domain including a proline residue perfectly
conserved among U-box proteins. Western blot analysis detected Ufd2a at
an apparent molecular mass of 140 kD in most mouse tissues examined,
with highest abundance in cerebrum, cerebellum, and skeletal muscle.
Immunohistochemical analysis revealed localization of Ufd2a in the
cytoplasm of cortical pyramidal cells and cerebellar Purkinje cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By expressing epitope-tagged mouse proteins in human embryonic kidney
cells, Kaneko et al. (2003) showed that Ufd2a interacted with Vcp
(601023), a AAA-family ATPase implicated in protein folding.

Using an in vitro ubiquitination assay with mouse and human UBE4B and
MDM2 (164785), Wu et al. (2011) showed that either UBE4B or MDM2 alone
led to monoubiquitination of the tumor suppressor p53 (TP53; 191170),
while UBE4B in combination with MDM2 promoted p53 polyubiquitination.
Reciprocal immunoprecipitation analysis and protein pull-down assays
revealed that UBE4B interacted directly with MDM2. Overexpression and
knockdown studies in mouse and human cell lines revealed that
interaction of UBE4B with MDM2 reduced the half-life of p53 via
proteasome-mediated degradation and caused repression of p53-dependent
transactivation and apoptosis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Krona et al. (2003) determined that the UBE4B gene contains 28 exons.

Kaneko et al. (2003) found that the mouse Ube4b gene contains 27 coding
exons. The promoter region has a CpG island that contains a functional
cis-acting element, but no TATA or CAAT boxes.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1998) mapped the UBE4B
gene to chromosome 1. By genomic sequence analysis, Krona et al. (2003)
mapped the UBE4B gene to chromosome 1p36.3-p36.2.

613952	TITLE *613952 FAMILY WITH SEQUENCE SIMILARITY 46, MEMBER C; FAM46C
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

FAM46C is a type I interferon (e.g., IFNA1; 147660)-stimulated gene
(ISG) that encodes a protein that appears to enhance replication of
certain viruses (Schoggins et al., 2011).

GENE FUNCTION

Using an overexpression screening approach to test more than 380 ISGs,
including MB21D1, for their ability to inhibit replication of various
human and animal viruses, including hepatitis C virus (see 609532),
yellow fever virus (YFV), West Nile virus (see 610379), chikungunya
virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), and human
immunodeficiency virus-1 (see 609423), Schoggins et al. (2011) found
that FAM46C enhanced replication of YFV and VEEV. FAM46C had little or
no effect on other viruses tested.

MAPPING

Gross (2011) mapped the FAM46C gene to chromosome 1p12 based on an
alignment of the FAM46C sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC036516) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

608003	TITLE *608003 HOMEODOMAIN-INTERACTING PROTEIN KINASE 1; HIPK1
;;KIAA0630
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Ishikawa et al. (1998) obtained a partial HIPK1 cDNA clone,
which they designated KIAA0630. Over 295 amino acids, the deduced
sequence shares 32.2% identity with a serine/threonine protein kinase.
RT-PCR detected expression in all tissues examined.

Ecsedy et al. (2003) cloned mouse Hipk1. Northern blot analysis detected
expression in all mouse and human tissues examined. RNA dot-blot
analysis of human tissues detected expression in all adult and fetal
tissues. Immunolocalization of Hipk1 in mouse fibroblasts detected
punctate nuclear staining. Hipk1 also localized throughout the nucleus
and was excluded only from nucleoli. In addition, there was a diffuse
cytoplasmic staining.

Using p53 (191170) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen, Kondo et al.
(2003) cloned rat Hipk1, and using the rat cDNA as probe, they cloned
human HIPK1 from a skeletal muscle cDNA library. The deduced 1,210-amino
acid protein contains a putative serine/threonine kinase domain.
Northern blot analysis detected expression of a 9-kb transcript in
heart, brain, placenta, skeletal muscle, and pancreas.

GENE FUNCTION

Ecsedy et al. (2003) found that HIPK1, but not a kinase-dead mutant
(lys219 to ala), underwent autophosphorylation and was able to
phosphorylate substrate proteins in vitro. Endogenous HIPK1
immunoprecipitated with DAXX (603186) from human embryonic kidney cells
and phosphorylated DAXX in vitro and in vivo. HIPK1 phosphorylated DAXX
on ser669, and phosphorylation diminished DAXX transcriptional
repression in 3 of 4 reporters assayed. In human embryonic kidney cells,
interaction with HIPK1 resulted in the relocalization of DAXX from
promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML; 102578) oncogenic domains (PODs).
The relocalization required the HIPK1 kinase domain, but it was
independent of DAXX phosphorylation.

Kondo et al. (2003) confirmed interaction between HIPK1 and p53 by
immunoprecipitation assays. Deletion analysis showed that amino acids
100 to 370 of p53 and 885 to 1093 of HIPK1 were sufficient for the
interaction. HIPK1 serine phosphorylated p53 and was able to
autophosphorylate. Kondo et al. (2003) found HIPK1 expression elevated
in 12 of 14 breast cancer cell lines. In 2 of these cell lines, HIPK1
was expressed at more than 10 times the control levels. Oncogenically
transformed mouse embryonic fibroblasts developed from Hipk1-null mice
showed reduced transcription of Mdm2 (164785) and were more susceptible
to apoptosis induced by DNA damage. Carcinogen-treated Hipk1-null mice
developed fewer and smaller skin tumors than wildtype mice.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1998) mapped the HIPK1
gene to chromosome 1. By in situ hybridization, Kondo et al. (2003)
mapped the HIPK1 gene to chromosome 1p13.

300110	TITLE *300110 CALCIUM CHANNEL, VOLTAGE-DEPENDENT, ALPHA-1F SUBUNIT; CACNA1F
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The human Xp11.23-p11.22 interval is involved in several hereditary
diseases. Fisher et al. (1997) noted that in constructing YAC contigs
spanning this region, it was found that the region of Xp surrounding the
synaptophysin gene (SYP; 313475) was refractory to cloning in YACs, but
highly stable in cosmids. Preliminary analysis of the cosmid suggested a
high density of coding sequences and prompted complete sequencing of an
SYP-containing cosmid. Fisher et al. (1997) identified 29 putative exons
organized into 3 genes, in addition to the 7 exons of the complete SYP
coding region, all mapping within a 44-kb interval. Two genes were
novel: one (CACNA1F) shows high homology to alpha-1 subunits of calcium
channels (see CACNA2; 114204), whereas the other (LMO6; 300111) encodes
a product with significant similarity to LIM-domain proteins. RT-PCR and
Northern blot studies confirmed that these loci were indeed transcribed.
The third locus (A4; 300112) had been previously described but not
localized to a specific chromosomal site. The region has an elevated GC
content (more than 53%), and Fisher et al. (1997) identified CpG islands
associated with the 5-prime ends of SYP, A4, and LMO6.

Naylor et al. (2000) cloned the mouse Cacna1f gene. The deduced
1,985-amino acid channel protein shares 90% identity with the
1,977-amino acid human protein, with almost perfect conservation between
the functional domains and only a single amino acid substitution within
the transmembrane segments. RT-PCR of several mouse tissues detected
Cacna1f expression only in eye. In situ hybridization detected Cacna1f
in the outer nuclear layer, the inner nuclear layer, and the ganglion
cell layer of mouse retina.

GENE FUNCTION

To study the electrophysiologic and pharmacologic properties of the
L-type calcium channel CACNA1F, Baumann et al. (2004) cloned and
functionally expressed the complete Cacna1f cDNA from the mouse retina.
The data indicated that CACNA1F constitutes the major molecular
correlate of the retinal L-type calcium current. Its intrinsic
biophysical properties, in particular its unique inactivation
properties, enable it to provide a sustained calcium current over the
voltage range required for tonic glutamate release at the photoreceptor
synapse.

Liu et al. (2010) combined electrophysiology to characterize channel
regulation with optical fluorescence resonance energy transfer sensor
determination of free-apocalmodulin (CALM1; 114180) concentration in
live cells. This approach translates quantitative calmodulin
biochemistry from the traditional test-tube context into the realm of
functioning holochannels within intact cells. From this perspective, Liu
et al. (2010) found that long splice forms of Ca(V)1.3 (CACNA1D; 114206)
and Ca(V)1.4 (CACNA1F) channels include a distal carboxy tail that
resembles an enzyme competitive inhibitor that retunes channel affinity
for apocalmodulin such that natural calmodulin variations affect the
strength of Ca(2+) feedback modulation. Given the ubiquity of these
channels, the connection between ambient calmodulin levels and Ca(2+)
entry through channels is broadly significant for Ca(2+) homeostasis.

MAPPING

Fisher et al. (1997) determined that the order of loci in the
Xp11.23-p11.22 interval is Xpter-A4-LMO6-SYP-CACNA1F-Xcen, with
intergenic distances ranging from approximately 300 bp to approximately
5 kb. The density of transcribed sequences in this area (more than 80%)
is comparable to that found in the highly gene-rich band Xq28.

Naylor et al. (2000) mapped the mouse Cacna1f gene to a region of the X
chromosome that shows homology of synteny to human chromosome Xp11.23.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Incomplete Congenital Stationary Night Blindness, Type 2A

Conducting mutation analysis in 13 families with the incomplete form of
X-linked congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB2A; 300071), Strom
et al. (1998) identified 9 different mutations in 10 families, including
3 nonsense and 1 frameshift mutation. Similarly, by mutation analysis of
the CACNA1F gene in 20 families with incomplete CSNB, Bech-Hansen et al.
(1998) found 6 different mutations, all of which predicted premature
protein truncation.

Boycott et al. (2001) summarized 20 CACNA1F mutations that had been
identified in 36 families with incomplete X-linked congenital stationary
night blindness. Three of the mutations accounted for incomplete CSNB in
2 or more families, and a founder effect was demonstrable for one of
these mutations. Of the 20 mutations identified, 14 (70%) were predicted
to cause premature protein truncation and 6 (30%) to cause amino acid
substitutions or deletions at conserved positions in the alpha-1F
protein.

Wutz et al. (2002) reported comprehensive mutation analysis of the 48
exons of the CACNA1F gene in 34 unrelated cases (33 families and 1
sporadic case) diagnosed with the incomplete form of X-linked congenital
stationary night blindness, based on ERG data and dark adaptation tests.
Ten of the families had been partially characterized previously (Strom
et al., 1998). The patients were of German (32), Belgian (1), and French
(1) origin. Mutation analysis was also performed in 2 patients with an
Aland Island disease (300600)-related phenotype. A total of 30 different
mutations (20 of which were novel) were identified in 33 patients, 31
CSNB2 familial cases, and the 2 patients with an AIED-like phenotype.
Reevaluation of the AIED-like phenotype indicated full compatibility of
the patients' ophthalmologic findings with CSNB2. The mutations were
equally distributed over the entire gene sequence and included 13
missense, 8 nonsense, 5 splice site, 3 deletion, and 1 insertion
mutations. RT-PCR experiments in mouse strains with photoreceptor
degeneration showed that the Cacna1f gene is not exclusively expressed
in photoreceptors but in the outer nuclear, the inner nuclear, and the
ganglion cell layer as well.

Nakamura et al. (2003) described 2 Japanese brothers with retinal and
optic disc atrophy and progressive decrease of visual function with
increasing age. Although these clinical features are atypical of
patients with incomplete CSNB, both patients had an in-frame mutation
with deletion and insertion in exon 4 of the CACNA1F gene. In both
patients, the bright flash, mixed rod-cone ERG had a negative
configuration, characteristic of incomplete CSNB. However, the
full-field scotopic and photopic ERGs were nonrecordable, indicating
severe, diffuse retinal malfunction, not typical of incomplete CSNB.
These findings underscored the phenotypic variability of incomplete
CSNB.

Hemara-Wahanui et al. (2005) identified an ile745-to-thr mutation
(I745T; 300110.0006) in the CACNA1F gene in a New Zealand family with a
visual disorder more severe than typical CSNB2.

- Cone-Rod Dystrophy 3

In a large Finnish family with X-linked cone-rod dystrophy-3 (CORDX3;
300476), previously reported by Jalkanen et al. (2003), Jalkanen et al.
(2006) identified a splice site mutation in the CACNA1F gene
(300110.0007).

- Aland Island Eye Disease

In affected members of the original family with Aland Island eye disease
(300600) described by Forsius and Eriksson (1964), Jalkanen et al.
(2007) identified homozygosity for a 425-bp deletion mutation
encompassing exon 30 and portions of adjacent introns of the CACN1F gene
(300110.0008). The mutation was found in heterozygous state in carrier
females of this family and was not found in samples from 121 Finnish
male control subjects.

ANIMAL MODEL

Mansergh et al. (2005) generated a mouse with a loss-of-function
mutation in exon 7 of the mouse Cacna1f gene. Electroretinography of the
mutant mouse revealed a scotopic a-wave of marginally reduced amplitude
compared with the wildtype mouse and absence of the postreceptoral
b-wave and oscillatory potentials. Cone ERG responses together with
visual evoked potentials and multi-unit activity in the superior
colliculus were also absent. Calcium imaging of retinal slices
depolarized with KCl showed 90% less peak signal in the photoreceptor
synapses of the Cacna1f mutant than in wildtype mice. The absence of
postreceptoral ERG responses and the diminished photoreceptor calcium
signals were consistent with a loss of Ca(2+) channel function in
photoreceptors. Immunocytochemistry showed no detectable Cav1.4 protein
in the outer plexiform layer of Cacna1f-mutant mice, profound loss of
photoreceptor synapses, and abnormal dendritic sprouting of second-order
neurons in the photoreceptor layer. Mansergh et al. (2005) concluded
that the Cav1.4 calcium channel is vital for the functional assembly
and/or maintenance and synaptic functions of photoreceptor ribbon
synapses.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
NIGHT BLINDNESS, CONGENITAL STATIONARY, TYPE 2A
CACNA1F, GLY369ASP

One of the missense mutations identified by Strom et al. (1998) in cases
of incomplete X-linked congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB2A;
300071) was a gly369-to-asp (G369D) amino acid substitution resulting
from a transition of nucleotide 1106 in exon 8.

.0002
NIGHT BLINDNESS, CONGENITAL STATIONARY, TYPE 2A
CACNA1F, ARG958TER

One of the nonsense mutations identified in families with incomplete
X-linked congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB2A; 300071) by Strom
et al. (1998) was an arg958-to-ter (R958X) mutation due to a C-to-T
transition of nucleotide 2172 in exon 24.

.0003
NIGHT BLINDNESS, CONGENITAL STATIONARY, TYPE 2A
CACNA1F, 1-BP INS, 991C

In 15 CSNB2A (300071) families with the common Mennonite haplotype,
suggesting that these families share a founder mutation (Boycott et al.
(1998)), Bech-Hansen et al. (1998) found insertion of a single C
nucleotide at codon 991 for leucine (L991insC). The insertion caused a
frameshift with stop codon 1001.

.0004
NIGHT BLINDNESS, CONGENITAL STATIONARY, TYPE 2A
CACNA1F, ARG830TER

Among families with CSNB2A (300071), one of the truncating mutations
found by Bech-Hansen et al. (1998) was a C-to-T transition in exon 21 of
the CACNA1F gene, resulting in an arg830-to-ter (R830X) nonsense amino
acid change.

.0005
NIGHT BLINDNESS, CONGENITAL STATIONARY, TYPE 2A
CACNA1F, 1-BP DEL, 4548C

In 2 affected members of a French family segregating X-linked congenital
stationary night blindness type 2, Jacobi et al. (2003) identified a
1-bp deletion (C) at nucleotide 4548 in the CACNA1F gene, resulting in a
frameshift with a predicted premature termination at codon 1524.

.0006
NIGHT BLINDNESS, CONGENITAL STATIONARY, TYPE 2A, SEVERE
CACNA1F, ILE745THR

Hemara-Wahanui et al. (2005) identified a C-to-T transition at
nucleotide 2234 in exon 17 of the CACNA1F gene in a New Zealand family
with a retinal disorder similar to, but more severe than, X-linked
congenital stationary night blindness-2 (CSNB2A; 300071). The transition
resulted in the substitution of a conserved isoleucine with threonine at
residue 745 (I745T) within transmembrane segment IIS6. Affected males
had congenital nystagmus, decreased visual acuity, frequent
hypermetropia, and normal fundi. Female family members had congenital
nystagmus, decreased visual acuity, and frequent high myopia, in
contrast to typical CSNB2A families, in which female heterozygotes are
unaffected. Electroretinography showed CSNB2A-like features in males and
similar, but less severe, features in females. In addition, some
visually impaired males had intellectual impairment and were autistic.
Hemara-Wahanui et al. (2005) found that the I745T mutation caused
altered channel activity following expression in human embryonic kidney
cells. The channel showed a dramatic shift of about -30 mV in the
voltage dependence of activation and significantly slower inactivation
kinetics. Hemara-Wahanui et al. (2005) concluded that the I745T mutation
increases the number of mutant channels open at physiologic membrane
potential and allows for persistent Ca(2+) entry due to reduced channel
inactivation, resulting in a gain-of-function defect.

.0007
CONE-ROD DYSTROPHY, X-LINKED, 3
CACNA1F, 5-BP DEL/3-BP INS

In a large Finnish family with X-linked cone-rod dystrophy-3 (CORDX3;
300476), previously reported by Jalkanen et al. (2003), Jalkanen et al.
(2006) identified a deletion/insertion (IVS28-1 GCGTC-TGG) at -1
position in the splice acceptor site of intron 28 of the CACNA1F gene.
The mutation cosegregated completely with the disease phenotype in the
family, which included 7 affected males, 10 carrier females, and 33
unaffected family members; it was not found in 200 control chromosomes.
RNA studies revealed that the mutation caused altered splicing of the
CACNA1F transcript, resulting in 5 variants with predicted premature
termination and exonic deletions of the encoded protein.

.0008
ALAND ISLAND EYE DISEASE
CACNA1F, 425-BP DEL

In affected members of the original family with Aland Island eye disease
(300600) described by Forsius and Eriksson (1964), Jalkanen et al.
(2007) identified homozygosity for a 425-bp deletion mutation
encompassing exon 30 and portions of adjacent introns of the CACN1F
gene. The mutation was found in heterozygous state in carrier females of
this family and was not found in samples from 121 Finnish male control
subjects. The mutation is predicted to cause a deletion of the
transmembrane domain IVS2 and the preceding extracellular loop and
consequently an altered membrane topology for the C-terminal part of the
protein.

;;PROTEASE INHIBITOR 6; PI6;;
PLACENTAL THROMBIN INHIBITOR; PTI;;
SPI3, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; SPI3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Coughlin et al. (1993) described a cDNA encoding a serine proteinase
inhibitor present in placental tissue and in the cytosolic fraction of
the leukemic cell line K562. On the basis of its interaction with
thrombin, through which it was discovered, the inhibitor was
operationally named the placental thrombin inhibitor (PTI). Amino acid
sequence comparisons suggested that its reactive center is located at
arg341 and cys342, that it lacks a classic N-terminal signal sequence,
and that it has the highest degree of similarity to intracellular serine
proteinase inhibitors (serpins), such as the human monocyte/neutrophil
elastase inhibitor (ELANH2; 130135). Analysis of human tissue mRNA
indicated that PTI is expressed widely, with the highest levels in
cardiac and skeletal muscle and placenta. Coughlin et al. (1993)
concluded that PTI is a member of an emerging class of intracellular
serpins.

Sun et al. (1995) showed that expression of the mouse PI6 homolog, Spi3,
is developmentally regulated, and that, unlike the situation in the
human, Spi3 is absent from the mouse placenta.

Nishibori et al. (1995) isolated a serum protease, designated B43, from
bovine brain. They used histochemical staining to demonstrate its
presence in fibrous astroglial cells, particularly in endfeet-like
cellular structures, suggesting its involvement in the blood-brain
barrier. Partial amino acid sequence of the protease suggested that it
was the homolog of human PI6 and mouse Spi3.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sun et al. (1995) determined that the mouse Spi3 gene spans 20 kb,
contains 7 exons and 6 introns, and contains a TATA motif 24 bp upstream
of the transcriptional start site.

MAPPING

Coughlin et al. (1995) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to map
the SERPINB6 gene to chromosome 6p25.

While studying a cluster of serine proteinase inhibitors of the
ovalbumin family, including maspin (SERPINB6; 154790) located on
chromosome 18q21.3, Schneider et al. (1995) prepared PCR primer sets for
the 3-prime untranslated region of PTI. Using the NIGMS monochromosomal
somatic cell hybrid panel, they mapped the PTI gene to chromosome 6.
Evans et al. (1995) confirmed the assignment to chromosome 6 and
regionalized it to 6pter-p24 by demonstrating that PI6 colocalizes with
another Ov-serpin gene, ELANH2 (130135). The localization was achieved
with a chromosome 6 regional hybrid DNA panel.

Sun et al. (1995) mapped the mouse Spi3 gene to chromosome 13 between
the Pl1 and ctla2a genes.

GENE FUNCTION

Sirmaci et al. (2010) found that Serpinb6 was expressed in crista hair
cells of the mouse inner ear at embryonic day (E) 16.5. Hair cell
expression was sustained in adult mice. Serpinb6 was expressed in the
cytoplasm of both cochlear and utricular hair cells in the embryo and
early postnatal age, and in the greater epithelial ridge region in early
postnatal age.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By genomewide linkage analysis followed by candidate gene sequencing in
affected members of a consanguineous Turkish family with nonsyndromic
progressive hearing loss (DFNB91; 613453), Sirmaci et al. (2010)
identified a homozygous truncating mutation in the SERPINB6 gene (E245X;
173321.0001), resulting in loss of function. Sirmaci et al. (2010)
concluded that SERPINB6 plays an important role in the inner ear in the
protection against leakage of lysosomal content during stress, and that
loss of this protection results in cell death and sensorineural hearing
loss.

Scarff et al. (2004) found that Spi3-deficient mice developed normally,
were fertile, and had no obvious pathology. Increased levels of Elanh2
in the tissues of mutant mice suggested that compensation by other
serpins reduced the impact of Spi3 deficiency.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
DEAFNESS, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 91
SERPINB6, GLU245TER

In affected members of a consanguineous Turkish family with nonsyndromic
progressive hearing loss (DFNB91; 613453), Sirmaci et al. (2010)
identified a homozygous 744G-T transversion in the SERPINB6 gene,
resulting in a gly245-to-ter (E245X) substitution, which removes 131
amino acids in the C-terminal region that includes the reactive center
loop. Further studies showed that the mutation resulted in mRNA decay
and complete lack of protein expression. The mutation was not found in
300 Turkish controls or in an additional 542 Turkish, Greek, American,
and Palestinian families, mostly with congenital hearing loss. In vitro
functional expression studies in HeLa cells showed that the E245X
mutation resulted in increased loss of lysosomal integrity in response
to osmotic shock compared to cells transfected with wildtype SERPINB6.
These findings suggested that wildtype SERPINB6 is required to counter
potentially cytotoxic components of leaking lysosomal proteases that
result from various stress conditions. Although the precise age of onset
could not be ascertained, the youngest affected individual, who was 23
years old, reported loss of hearing after age 20. The hearing loss was
progressive and age-dependent, consistent with a loss of function of an
intracellular protease inhibitor.
