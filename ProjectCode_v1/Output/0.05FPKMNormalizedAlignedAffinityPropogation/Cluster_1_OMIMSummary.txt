PC4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By differential screening for cDNAs upregulated during nerve growth
factor (NGF; 162030)-induced neural differentiation in rat PC12 cells,
Tirone and Shooter (1989) cloned Pc4. The deduced protein contains 3
highly hydrophobic regions. Northern blot analysis of adult rat tissues
detected expression in skeletal muscle, heart, and spleen, but not in
kidney, liver, and brain. In day-13.5 rat embryonic tissues, expression
was detected in brain, placenta, and amnion.

The rat Pc4 gene, initially isolated as a nerve growth factor-inducible
sequence in PC12 cells, is necessary for muscle differentiation and may
have a role in signal transduction. By searching EST databases with a
rat Pc4 cDNA, Buanne et al. (1998) isolated ESTs encoding IFDR1, a human
homolog of rat Pc4. The deduced 453-amino acid human IFRD1 protein is
90% identical to both rat and mouse Ifrd1 (Pc4), and 47.6% identical to
human SKMc15 (IFRD2; 602725). The C terminus of IFRD1 shows 47.5%
similarity to the entire human interferon-gamma (IFNG; 147570) protein.
IFRD1 has a calculated molecular mass of 50,685 Da. Northern blot
analysis detected a 2.2-kb IFRD1 transcript in several human tissues,
although at different levels of expression. At midgestation during mouse
development, Ifrd1 was expressed primarily in specific differentiating
structures and body organs.

GENE FUNCTION

By RT-PCR-based differential display, Vietor et al. (2002) identified
Tis7 as a gene upregulated upon Jun (165160)-induced loss of polarity in
a mouse mammary epithelial cell line. In unpolarized cells, the level of
Tis7 protein was elevated and Tis7 translocated into the nucleus. cDNA
microarray analysis revealed that overexpression of Tis7 repressed
several genes. By yeast 2-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation analyses,
Vietor et al. (2002) determined that Tis7 interacts with several
proteins of the SIN3 complex, including Sin3b (607777), Hdac1 (601241),
Ncor (600849), and Sap30 (603378). The coprecipitated complex was
enzymatically active and repressed transcription of a reporter gene.

GENE STRUCTURE

Brkanac et al. (2009) stated that the IFRD1 gene comprises 12 exons.

MAPPING

Based on STSs, Buanne et al. (1998) tentatively mapped the IFRD1 gene to
7q22-q31.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

To identify genetic modifiers of lung disease severity in cystic
fibrosis (219700), Gu et al. (2009) performed a genomewide
single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) scan in 1 cohort of cystic fibrosis
patients, replicating top candidates in an independent cohort. This
approach identified IFRD1 as a modifier of cystic fibrosis lung disease
severity. IFRD1 is a histone deacetylase-dependent transcriptional
coregulator expressed during terminal neutrophil differentiation.
Neutrophils, but not macrophages, from Ifrd1-null mice showed blunted
effector function, associated with decreased NF-kappa-B p65 (RELA;
164014) transactivation. In vivo, IFRD1 deficiency caused delayed
bacterial clearance from the airway, but also less inflammation and
disease--a phenotype primarily dependent on hematopoietic cell
expression, or lack of expression, of IFRD1. In humans, IFRD1
polymorphisms were significantly associated with variation in neutrophil
effector function. The IFRD SNP dbSNP rs7817 showed significant
association with both cross-sectional or longitudinal measures of lung
function with a P value of less than 0.05 after Bonferroni correction.
Notably, both family-based association and quantitative transmission
disequilibrium tests showed that the heterozygote genotype CT was
associated with lower lung function than either homozygote CC or TT.

Brkanac et al. (2009) identified a missense mutation in the IFRD1 gene,
a A-to-G transition at nucleotide 743 that resulting in an ile-to-val
substitution at codon 172 (I172V), that segregated absolutely with the
SMNA (607458) phenotype in a 6-generation American family of Irish
descent. Isoleucine-172 is highly conserved across species, but valine
at this position is present in elephant, chicken, Xenopus tropicalis,
and zebrafish. Brkanac et al. (2009) suggested that this change might
affect protein structure. However, they concluded that mutation analysis
of IFRD1 in additional patients with similar phenotypes was needed for
demonstration of causality and further evaluation of the importance of
IRFD1 in neurologic diseases.

ANIMAL MODEL

Vadivelu et al. (2004) found that Tis7 knockout mice were fertile and
showed no gross histologic abnormalities. However, Tis7 disruption
delayed skeletal muscle regeneration and altered skeletal muscle
isometric contractile properties after muscle crush damage, and it
downregulated expression of several muscle-specific genes. Cultured
primary myogenic satellite cells from Tis7 -/- mice showed reduced
differentiation potential and fusion index. Vadivelu et al. (2004)
concluded that TIS7 plays a regulatory role during adult muscle
regeneration.

SPERM OOCYTE-BINDING PROTEIN 1; SOB1
DESCRIPTION A-kinase anchor proteins (AKAPs; see 602449) direct the activity of
protein kinase A (PKA; see 176911) by tethering the enzyme near its
physiologic substrates.

Lefevre et al. (1999) purified and sequenced a human sperm
oocyte-binding protein (SOB1). Using degenerate PCR primers based on the
peptide sequences of SOB1, they obtained a cDNA encoding a novel member
of the AKAP family, AKAP3. The deduced 853-amino acid protein has 4
N-glycosylation sites, 26 phosphorylation sites, 8 N-myristoylation
sites, and 1 amidation site. Northern blot analysis revealed expression
of an approximately 3-kb transcript in testis only.

Independently, Vijayaraghavan et al. (1999) cloned human AKAP3, which
they designated AKAP110, and its murine and bovine homologs. Western
blot analysis determined that the RII binding site is in the N terminus
and comprises residues 124 to 141. Northern blot analysis revealed
expression of an approximately 3.6-kb transcript in testis only. In situ
hybridization analysis showed restricted expression in round spermatids.
Spermatozoa stained with anti-AKAP3 exhibited intense fluorescence of
the anterior acrosome and along the entire flagellum of bovine sperm,
suggesting that AKAP3 associates with both the RI and RII subunits of
PKA. By immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy, Mandal et al.
(1999) determined that human AKAP3 localizes to the ribs of the fibrous
sheath in the principal piece of the sperm tail.

By Southern blot analysis, Lefevre et al. (1999) demonstrated that AKAP3
is a single copy gene. Mandal et al. (1999) determined that AKAP3 has 5
exons separated by 4 introns.

By FISH, Mandal et al. (1999) and Lefevre et al. (1999) mapped the AKAP3
gene to chromosome 12p13.

602997	TITLE *602997 CUBILIN; CUBN
;;INTRINSIC FACTOR-COBALAMIN RECEPTOR; IFCR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cubilin is the intestinal receptor for the endocytosis of intrinsic
factor (IF; 609342)-vitamin B12 and a receptor in epithelial apoA-I/HDL
(see 107680) metabolism (summary by Kozyraki et al., 1998).

CLONING

By surface plasmon resonance analysis of ligand-affinity-purified human
cubilin, Kozyraki et al. (1998) demonstrated a high affinity calcium-
and cobalamin (vitamin B12)-dependent binding of gastric intrinsic
factor (IF)-cobalamin. Complete cDNA cloning of the human receptor
showed a 3,598-amino acid peripheral membrane protein with 69% identity
to rat cubilin. Amino-terminal sequencing of the receptor indicated that
the cDNA sequence encodes a precursor protein undergoing proteolytic
processing due to cleavage at a recognition site
(arg-7/glu-8/lys-9/arg-10) for the trans-Golgi proteinase furin
(136950).

MAPPING

Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, radiation hybrid mapping, and
screening of YAC clones, Kozyraki et al. (1998) mapped the human cubilin
gene between markers D10S1661 and WI-5445 on the short arm of chromosome
10. This was within the 6-cM region harboring the gene responsible for
megaloblastic anemia-1 (MGA1; 261100). All of this was considered
circumstantial evidence that an impaired synthesis, processing, or
ligand binding of cubilin is the molecular basis of Imerslund-Grasbeck
disease (MGA1).

GENE FUNCTION

Studies in rodents showed that uptake of cobalamin in complex with IF is
facilitated by an intestinal 460-kD protein (Birn et al., 1997;
Seetharam et al., 1997), designated cubilin (Moestrup et al., 1998).
Cubilin is suggested to traffic by means of megalin (LRP2; 600073), a
600-kD endocytic receptor expressed in the same tissues and mediating
uptake of a number of ligands, including transcobalamin-cobalamin
complexes. Like megalin, cubilin has a significantly higher expression
in the renal proximal tubules compared with the intestine, and, because
IF is only present in minute amounts in nongastrointestinal tissues,
cubilin might also have multiligand properties. Cubilin binds
receptor-associated protein (RAP; 104225), a 40-kD endoplasmic reticulum
protein also binding with high affinity to the multiligand giant
receptors (e.g., megalin) belonging to the low density lipoprotein
receptor (LDLR; 606945) protein family. RAP may function as a chaperone
during folding of the receptors. Moestrup et al. (1998) determined the
primary structure of rat cubilin and showed that almost the entire
sequence is accounted for by a cluster of 8 epidermal growth factor
(EGF) repeats, followed by a large cluster of 27 CUB domains which led
to the designation of the receptor. (The name CUB, introduced by Bork
and Beckmann (1993), is an abbreviation for complement subcomponents
C1r/C1s (613785; 120580), Uegf, and bone morphogenetic protein-1 (BMP1;
112264).)

Although cubilin is the intestinal receptor for the endocytosis of
intrinsic factor-vitamin B12, several lines of evidence, including a
high expression in kidney and yolk sac, indicated that it may have
additional functions. Using cubilin affinity chromatography, Kozyraki et
al. (1999) isolated apolipoprotein A-I (APOA1; 107680), the main protein
of high density lipoprotein (HDL). They demonstrated a high-affinity
binding of APOA1 and HDL to cubilin, and cubilin-expressing yolk sac
cells showed efficient endocytosis of iodine-labeled HDL that could be
inhibited by IgG antibodies against APOA1 and cubilin. The physiologic
relevance of the cubilin-APOA1 interaction was further emphasized by
urinary APOA1 loss in some known cases of functional cubilin deficiency
(Imerslund-Grasbeck syndrome). Therefore, cubilin is a receptor in
epithelial APOA1/HDL metabolism.

Megalin binds a large number of structurally unrelated ligands, and
coreceptors may confer ligand specificity by sequestering and presenting
their cargo to megalin. For example, IF-B12 complex is taken up in the
intestine by a tandem receptor-mediated mechanism; the complex is first
bound to a receptor, cubilin, anchored to the outer leaflet of the
plasma membrane possibly by an amphipathic helix, followed by
endocytosis of cubilin and its cargo mediated by megalin. The pivotal
role of intestinal cubilin is underscored by the vitamin B12 deficiency
observed in patients with Imerslund-Grasbeck disease characterized by
defective cubilin incapable of binding IF-B12. These patients have low
molecular weight proteinuria in addition to megaloblastic anemia,
indicating dysfunction of cubilin coexpressed with megalin in kidney
proximal tubules (summary by Nykjaer et al., 2001).

Nykjaer et al. (2001) identified cubilin as an important coreceptor in
the endocytic pathway for retrieval of 25(OH)D3-DBP complexes by
megalin-mediated endocytosis in the kidney. They showed that absence of
cubilin or inhibition of its function markedly reduces cellular uptake
of the steroid-carrier complex, and animals or patients lacking
functional cubilin are characterized by abnormal vitamin D metabolism.
They identified patients with mutations in an endocytic pathway that
regulates steroid hormone metabolism.

Cubilin recognizes intrinsic factor (IF)-cobalamin and various other
proteins to be endocytosed in the intestine and kidney, respectively.
Fyfe et al. (2004) showed that cubilin and amnionless (AMN; 605799)
colocalize in the endocytic apparatus of polarized epithelial cells and
copurify as a tight complex during IF-cobalamin affinity and
nondenaturing gel filtration chromatography. In transfected cells
expressing either AMN or a truncated IF-cobalamin-binding cubilin
construct, neither protein alone conferred ligand endocytosis. Other
studies indicated that cubilin and AMN are subunits of a novel
cubilin/AMN (cubam) complex, where AMN binds to the N-terminal third of
cubilin and directs subcellular localization and endocytosis of cubilin
with its ligand. Fyfe et al. (2004) concluded that mutations affecting
either of the 2 proteins may abrogate function of the cubam complex and
cause Imerslund-Grasbeck syndrome.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Andersen et al. (2010) presented the crystal structure of the complex
between gastric intrinsic factor (IF; 609342)-cobalamin and the
CUBN-IF-cobalamin-binding region determined at 3.3-angstrom resolution.
The structure provided insight into how several CUB (complement C1r/C1s,
Uegf, Bmp1) domains collectively function as modular ligand-binding
regions, and how 2 distant CUB domains embrace the cobalamin molecule by
binding the 2 IF domains in a calcium-dependent manner. This dual-point
model provided a probable explanation of how cobalamin indirectly
induces ligand-receptor coupling. Finally, the comparison of
calcium-binding CUB domains and the LDLR-type A modules suggested that
the electrostatic pairing of a basic ligand arginine/lysine residue with
calcium-coordinating acidic aspartates/glutamates is a common theme of
calcium-dependent ligand-receptor interactions.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Megaloblastic anemia-1 (MGA1; 261100) is a rare, autosomal recessive
disorder characterized by juvenile megaloblastic anemia, as well as
neurologic symptoms that may be the only manifestations. At the cellular
level, MGA1 is characterized by selective intestinal B12 malabsorption.
MGA1 occurs worldwide, but its prevalence is higher in several Middle
Eastern countries and in Norway, and highest in Finland (0.8 in
100,000). Aminoff et al. (1995) mapped the MGA1 locus by linkage
analysis in Finnish and Norwegian families to a 6-cM region on 10p12.1.
As the receptor for intrinsic factor-B12 complex (IF-B12), the CUBN gene
was a logical candidate for the site of the mutation and was also a
positional candidate because it maps to the same region. Aminoff et al.
(1999) refined the MGA1 region by linkage disequilibrium (LD) mapping,
fine-mapped the CUBN gene in 17 Finnish MGA1 families, and identified 2
independent disease-specific CUBN mutations.

Nykjaer et al. (2001) found that a patient with megaloblastic anemia-1
who was homozygous for the intronic single-nucleotide substitution
causing the activation of a cryptic splice site and leading to an
insertion into domain 6 of the CUBN (602997.0002) gene showed urinary
loss of DBP and 25(OH)D3. On the other hand, patients with the missense
mutation P1297L (602997.0001) reabsorbed DBP normally, suggesting that
the binding site for 25(OH)D3-DBP is distinct from the binding site for
IF-B12.

In a patient with megalobastic anemia-1, Finnish type, Storm et al.
(2011) identified homozygosity for a splice site mutation in the CUBN
gene (602997.0003). This patient showed no immunogenic reaction to
cubilin and was found to have an abnormal cytoplasmic, vesicular
distribution of amnionless, its receptor partner, in renal biopsy
specimen, indicating that amnionless depends on cubilin for correct
localization in the human proximal tubule.

ANIMAL MODEL

Mixed breed dogs exhibiting autosomal recessive inheritance of cubilin
malexpression have been reported (Fyfe et al., 1991; Xu et al., 1999).
In these dogs, Nykjaer et al. (2001) showed that there is a disturbance
of vitamin D metabolism as well as severe vitamin B12 deficiency similar
to that of patients with Imerslund-Grasbeck disease.

HISTORY

Megaloblastic anemia and neurologic disturbances are common symptoms of
deficiency of the coenzyme vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin). The cellular
uptake of the vitamin and its modified forms depends on the binding to
the carrier proteins, intrinsic factor (IF; 609342) produced in the
stomach, and transcobalamin, present in the circulation and various
tissue fluids. Hereditary forms of cobalamin deficiency are known to
relate to qualitatively abnormal IF (see 261000), to decreased synthesis
of transcobalamin (275350), and to a defect of the intestinal epithelium
leading to decreased uptake of IF-cobalamin and failure to absorb
cobalamin (Imerslund-Grasbeck disease (IGS), or megaloblastic anemia-1
(MGA1); 261100). Imerslund-Grasbeck disease has been shown by linkage
studies to be caused by mutation in a region designated MGA1
(megaloblastic anemia-1), located on 10p between markers D10S548 and
D10S466. The defect has been thought to be related to abnormal
epithelial translocation of cobalamin, perhaps due to decreased receptor
function/expression.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MEGALOBLASTIC ANEMIA 1, FINNISH TYPE
CUBN, PRO1297LEU

In 16 of 17 Finnish families segregating megaloblastic anemia-1
(261100), Aminoff et al. (1999) found that 31 of 34 disease chromosomes
carried a 3916C-T transition in the CUBN gene, resulting in a
pro1297-to-leu amino acid substitution in cubilin. The mutation was
found in only 1 of 316 control Finnish chromosomes. All parents were
heterozygous.

By site-directed mutagenesis, mammalian expression, and functional
comparison of the purified wildtype and Finnish mutant forms of the
IF-cobalamin-binding region of cubilin (amino acids 928-1386),
Kristiansen et al. (2000) investigated the functional implications of
the P1297L mutation. They found that the mutation impairs recognition of
intrinsic factor-vitamin B12 complex by cubilin.

.0002
MEGALOBLASTIC ANEMIA 1, FINNISH TYPE
CUBN, IVS6, C-G

Aminoff et al. (1999) found that in 1 Finnish family with MGA1 (261100),
the proband was homozygous for an intronic mutation which was found in
none of the 302 control Finnish chromosomes. An apparent in-frame
insertion had occurred due to a point mutation in the intron
interrupting domain 6 of the CUBN gene. The change was a C-to-G
transversion.

.0003
MEGALOBLASTIC ANEMIA 1, FINNISH TYPE
CUBN, IVS23, G-T, +1

Storm et al. (2011) identified a patient with Imerslund-Grasbeck
syndrome (261100) with a novel homozygous G-to-T transversion at the
conserved donor splice site of exon 23 of the CUBN gene. A renal biopsy
specimen from the patient showed no immunologic reaction for cubilin and
an abnormal cytoplasmic, vesicular distribution of amnionless (605799),
indicating that amnionless depends on cubilin for correct localization
in the human proximal tubule.

601580	TITLE *601580 CAPPING PROTEIN, ALPHA-1; CAPZA1
;;CAP PROTEIN, ACTIN, ALPHA-1 SUBUNIT; CAPPA1
DESCRIPTION Barron-Casella et al. (1995) stated that CapZ was identified in chicken
as a nonsevering, barbed-end actin-binding protein composed of alpha and
beta subunits. In the chicken, 2 cDNAs were isolated for the alpha
subunit. The alpha-1 and alpha-2 (CAPZA2; 601571) isoforms, which share
85% identity, are the products of 2 separate genes; 1 gene appears to be
responsible for beta-subunit expression (see CAPZB; 601572). By capping
the barbed end of actin filaments, CapZ regulates the growth of the
actin filament at the barbed end.

Cooper (1999) noted that the STS stSG3463 (GenBank GENBANK G43425),
which has been mapped to chromosome 1, shares sequence identity with the
corresponding region of a CAPZA1 cDNA.

Hart et al. (1997) cloned 3 mouse homologs of CAPZA1, 2 of which are
pseudogenes. They mapped the functional mouse Capza1 gene to chromosome
3 by interspecific backcross analysis.

614539	TITLE *614539 HELICASE, DNA, B; HELB
;;DNA HELICASE B;;
HDHB
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DNA replication, repair, recombination, and transcription require
unwinding of the DNA double-helical structure. DNA helicases, such as
HELB, are DNA-dependent ATPases that catalyze DNA unwinding (Tada et
al., 2001).

CLONING

Tada et al. (2001) cloned mouse Helb. The deduced 1,074-amino acid
protein has 7 conserved helicase motifs and a calculated molecular mass
of 121.5 kD. Helb had an apparent molecular mass of 130 kD by SDS-PAGE.

Using mouse Helb to search an EST database, followed by RT-PCR of HeLa
and HEK293 cell RNA, Taneja et al. (2002) cloned human HELB, which they
called HDHB. The deduced 1,087-amino acid protein has 7 helicase motifs,
including Walker A and Walker B motifs, characteristic of superfamily-1
helicases. It contains 9 potential phosphorylation sites. RT-PCR
analysis detected HELB expression in all tissues examined, with highest
levels in testis and thymus. Expression was also detected in several
human cell lines and in human foreskin fibroblasts. Western blot
analysis of transfected insect cells detected HELB at an apparent
molecular mass of 180 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Tada et al. (2001) identified a point mutation in Helb in
temperature-sensitive mutant cells derived from a mouse mammary
carcinoma cell line that exhibited reduced cell growth and DNA-dependent
ATPase activity when incubated at the nonpermissive temperature, 39
degree C. Growth arrest in mutant cells occurred at early S phase at the
nonpermissive temperature, suggesting that Helb functions in the early
stage of S phase.

Using recombinant protein expressed in insect cells, Taneja et al.
(2002) found that HDHB had robust ATPase activity in the presence of
single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) or a DNA fork-like substrate with
single-stranded 5-prime and 3-prime tails. It had little to no activity
against duplex DNA or RNA. Both ATP and deoxyATP, but not other ribo- or
deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, supported HDHB unwinding activity
against the fork structure. Helicase activity was detected with either
Mg(2+) or Mn(2+), but not with other divalent cations. HDHB showed
5-prime to 3-prime polarity of unwinding. HDHB stimulated synthesis of
RNA primers from M13 ssDNA by human DNA polymerase alpha-primase (see
176635) in the presence of RPA (RPA1; 179835). Inactivating mutations
within the Walker A or Walker B motifs of HDHB did not abrogate
coprecipitation of HDHB with the polymerase alpha-primase subunits p180
(POLA1; 312040) or p68 (POLA2). However, mutations within the Walker A
or Walker B motifs resulted in a dominant-negative HDHB protein that
interfered with wildtype HDHB and inhibited G1/S transition when
injected into HeLa cells in early G1.

Guler et al. (2012) found that chemical- or ultraviolet
irradiation-induced DNA damage caused recruitment of soluble nuclear
HDHB to chromatin in several human cell lines, predominantly during S
phase. Silencing of RPA70 (RPA1) reduced accumulation of HDHB on
chromatin. Mutation analysis and protein interaction assays revealed
that a basic cleft of the N-terminal oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide
binding-fold domain of RPA70 interacted with highly conserved acidic
residues C-terminal to the Walker A motif of HDHB. Knockdown of HDHB
increased replication stress caused by hydroxyurea exposure and
sensitized cells to camptothecin-induced DNA damage. Guler et al. (2012)
hypothesized that RPA70 recruits HDHB to sites of DNA damage and that
HDHB has a role in recovery from replication stress.

GENE STRUCTURE

Taneja et al. (2002) stated that the HELB gene contains over 13 exons.

MAPPING

Taneja et al. (2002) stated that the HELB gene maps to chromosome 12q13.

102540	TITLE *102540 ACTIN, ALPHA, CARDIAC MUSCLE; ACTC1
;;ACTC;;
SMOOTH MUSCLE ACTIN;;
ACTIN, ALPHA
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Because actin is a highly conserved protein, Engel et al. (1981) could
use cloned actin genes from Drosophila and from chicken to isolate 12
actin gene fragments from a human DNA library. Restriction endonuclease
studies of each indicated that they are not allelic and are from
nonoverlapping regions of the genome. In all, 25 to 30 EcoRI fragments
homologous to actin genes were found in the human genome and no
restriction site polymorphism was found indicating evolutionary
conservatism.

Humphries et al. (1981) used probes from the mouse to detect actin genes
in human DNA and concluded that there are about 20 actin genes in the
human genome. Three lines of evidence supported this number: the rate of
hybridization of the mouse probe with human DNA; the fact that the probe
hybridizes to 17-20 bands in Southern blots of restriction enzyme
digests of total human DNA; restriction enzyme mapping of individual
human actin genes indicating at least 9 different genes, judged on
probability grounds to have been picked from a pool of at least 20.

Hamada et al. (1982) isolated and characterized the human cardiac actin
gene. The cardiac and skeletal actin genes showed close similarity,
suggesting a relatively recent derivation from a common ancestral gene.
Nucleotide sequences of all exon/intron boundaries agreed with the GT/AG
rule (GT at the 5-prime and AG at the 3-prime termini of each intron).
Gunning et al. (1984) noted that the cardiac actin gene and the skeletal
actin gene (102610) on chromosome 1 are coexpressed in both skeletal and
heart muscle.

MAPPING

Using a cDNA fragment from an exon of the human cardiac actin gene in
somatic hybrid cell studies, Shows et al. (1984) showed that the gene is
coded by the segment 15q11-qter. Crosby et al. (1989) showed that in the
mouse the cardiac actin gene (Actc-1) is not on chromosome 17 as
previously reported (Czosnek et al., 1983) but is located on chromosome
2. It is closely linked to beta-2-microglobulin as indicated by mapping
studies using restriction fragment variants in recombinant inbred
strains. Using a highly polymorphic CA repeat microsatellite within
intron 4 of the ACTC gene, Kramer et al. (1992) did family linkage
studies with multiple markers on 15q, thus permitting the gene to be
placed on the chromosome linkage map. They demonstrated that it lies
about 0.06 cM proximal to D15S49, which is about 0.05 cM proximal to
D15S25, which in turn is about 0.07 cM proximal to D15S1; D15S1 is
tightly linked to the Marfan syndrome and to fibrillin. Thus ACTC may be
about 0.18 cM proximal to the fibrillin locus and no more distal than
15q21.1.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Ueyama et al. (1995) assigned the
ACTC1 gene to chromosome 15q14.

GENE FUNCTION

Actin has been identified in many kinds of cells including muscle, where
it is a major constituent of the thin filament, and platelets. Muscle
actins from sources as diverse as rabbits and fish are very similar in
amino acid sequence. Elzinga et al. (1976) examined whether actin in
different tissues of the same organism are products of the same gene.
They found that human platelet and human cardiac actins differ by one
amino acid, viz., threonine and valine, respectively, at position 129.
Thus they must be determined by different genes. Actins can be separated
by isoelectric focusing into 3 main groups which show more than 90%
homology of amino acid sequence. Firtel (1981) referred to the actin of
smooth muscle, the most acidic form, as alpha type and the 2 cytoplasmic
forms as beta and gamma. Beta and gamma actins are involved in the
cytoskeleton and in internal cell mobility phenomena.

The actins constitute multiple gene families. There is only a 4% amino
acid difference in the actins of Physarum and mammals. In mammals, 4
different muscle actins have been sequenced: from fast muscle, heart,
aorta, and stomach. These vary only by 4 to 6 amino acids from each
other, and by about 25 amino acids from the beta and gamma actins. Thus,
from the protein data, at least 6 actin genes would be expected in
mammals. Recombinant DNA probes for both actin and myosin of the mouse
have been made (Weydert et al., 1981).

Buckingham et al. (1986) provided a summary of the actin and myosin
multigene families in mouse and man. Certain inbred mouse lines, e.g.,
BALB/c, have a mutant cardiac actin locus (Garner et al., 1986). The
first 3 coding exons and promoter region of the gene are present as a
duplication immediately upstream from the cardiac actin gene. The
upstream promoter is active, and partial gene transcripts are generated
which are correctly spliced for the first 3 coding exons but which
terminate at cryptic sites in the region between the duplication and the
gene. Transcriptional activity at the upstream promoter interferes with
the downstream promoter of the bona fide cardiac actin gene, leading to
a 5- to 6-fold reduction in cardiac actin mRNA in the hearts of BALB/c
mice. In this situation there is an accumulation of skeletal actin gene
transcripts in the adult hearts of these mice, which partially
compensates for the reduction in cardiac actin transcripts. BALB/c mice
have a normal life span and their hearts do not undergo hypertrophy.
Apparently, cardiac and skeletal actins, which differ only by 4 out of
375 amino acids, are to some extent interchangeable. Schwartz et al.
(1986) found that under conditions of aortic stenosis leading to cardiac
overload and cardiac hypertrophy, skeletal actin gene transcripts are
found in adult rodent hearts in addition to the cardiac actin gene
products normally present.

Matsson et al. (2008) performed morpholino knockdown of the Actc1 gene
in chick embryos and found significant association with delayed looping
and reduced atrial septa, supporting a developmental role for the
protein.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Litt and Luty (1989) used PCR to amplify a microsatellite hypervariable
repeat in the human cardiac actin gene. They detected 12 different
allelic fragments in 37 unrelated individuals, of whom 32 were
heterozygous.

(Weber and May (1989) also found that (GT)n repeats within human loci
are highly polymorphic.) In vertebrates, 6 actin isoforms are known: 4
muscle types (skeletal, cardiac, and 2 smooth muscle types) and 2
nonmuscle types (cytoplasmic actins).

- Dilated Cardiomyopathy 1R

To test the hypothesis that actin dysfunction leads to heart failure,
Olson et al. (1998) examined patients with hereditary idiopathic dilated
cardiomyopathy (see 115200) for mutations in the cardiac ACTC gene.
Missense mutations in ACTC (102540.0001 and 102540.0002) that
cosegregated with a form of dilated cardiomyopathy, here designated
CMD1R (613424), were identified in 2 unrelated families, respectively.
Both mutations affected universally conserved amino acids in domains of
actin that attached to Z bands and intercalated discs. Coupled with
previous data showing that dystrophin mutations also cause dilated
cardiomyopathy, these results raised the possibility that defective
transmission of force in cardiac myocytes is a mechanism underlying
heart failure.

To determine how frequently mutations in the ACTC gene are responsible
for dilated cardiomyopathy, Takai et al. (1999) studied 136 Japanese
cases of this disorder. Although several polymorphisms were found, no
disease-causing changes were identified, leading Takai et al. (1999) to
conclude that mutation in the ACTC gene is a rare cause of dilated
cardiomyopathy, at least in Japanese patients.

Mayosi et al. (1999) studied 57 South African patients with dilated
cardiomyopathy, 56% of whom were of black African origin. No mutation
predicted to produce an alteration in protein was identified in either
the skeletal or cardiac actin genes in any patient.

- Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy 11

In a large 3-generation family with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (CMH11;
612098), Mogensen et al. (1999) identified heterozygosity for a missense
mutation in the ACTC1 gene (A295S; 102540.0003) that was located near 2
missense mutations previously identified as causing an inherited form of
dilated cardiomyopathy (CMD1R). The authors stated that ACTC1 was the
first sarcomeric gene described in which mutations are responsible for 2
different cardiomyopathies, and hypothesized that ACTC1 mutations
affecting sarcomere contraction lead to HCM and that mutations affecting
force transmission from the sarcomere to the surrounding syncytium lead
to dilated cardiomyopathy.

Olson et al. (2000) screened the ACTC1 gene in 368 unrelated patients
with sporadic or familial CMH and identified 3 different heterozygous
mutations in 2 sporadic patients with apical CMH (102540.0007 and
102540.0008, respectively) and in a 4-generation family segregating
autosomal dominant CMH (E101K; 102540.0009). None of the mutations was
detected in 150 unrelated controls, and each involved a highly conserved
residue in ACTC1. The authors noted that these and previously identified
CMH-related ACTC1 mutations are likely to affect actin-myosin
interaction and force generation; in contrast, CMD-related ACTC1
mutations (e.g., R312H and E361G) are not located in domains interacting
with the myosin head, but rather occur in a region of the actin monomer
that forms the immobilized end of the actin filament. Olson et al.
(2000) concluded that mutations in ACTC1 can cause either CMH or CMD,
depending on the functional domain of actin that is affected.

In affected members of 2 families segregating autosomal dominant apical
CMH over 3 generations, Arad et al. (2005) identified heterozygosity for
the E101K mutation in the ACTC1 gene.

Monserrat et al. (2007) screened 247 probands with CMH, CMD, or left
ventricular noncompaction (see LVNC4, 613424) for the E101K mutation,
and identified the mutation in 4 probands with CMH, 2 of whom were
previously studied by Arad et al. (2005), and in 1 proband with LVNC. Of
46 family members with CMH, 23 fulfilled criteria for LVNC, 22 were
diagnosed with apical CMH, and 3 had been diagnosed with restrictive
cardiomyopathy. Septal defects were identified in 9 mutation carriers
from 4 families (8 atrial defects and 1 ventricular), and were absent in
relatives without the mutation. Monserrat et al. (2007) concluded that
LVNC and CMH may appear as overlapping entities, and that E101K should
be considered in the genetic diagnosis of LVNC, apical CMH, and septal
defects.

In 2 unrelated children with idiopathic cardiac hypertrophy and presumed
sporadic cardiomyopathy, Morita et al. (2008) identified 2 different
missense mutations in the ACTC1 gene (see, e.g., 102540.0004); 1 of the
children also carried a missense mutation in the MYH7 gene (160760),
which is known to cause CMH1 (192600). The parents were not studied.

- Left Ventricular Noncompaction 4

Klaassen et al. (2008) analyzed 6 sarcomere protein genes in 63
unrelated adult probands with left ventricular noncompaction (see LVNC4;
613424) and no other congenital heart anomalies and identified the E101K
mutation in the ACTC1 gene in 2 probands.

- Atrial Septal Defect 5

Matsson et al. (2008) analyzed the ACTC1 gene in 2 large Swedish
families segregating autosomal dominant secundum atrial septal defect
(ASD5; 612794) and identified heterozygosity for a mutation (M123V;
102540.0005) in the 20 available affected individuals. The authors
studied 408 additional individuals referred for sporadic congenital
heart disease and identified a 17-bp deletion (102540.0006) in the ACTC1
gene in a 10-year-old girl with secundum ASD.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CARDIOMYOPATHY, DILATED, 1R
ACTC1, ARG312HIS

In a 36-year-old mother and 2 daughters, aged 5 and 2 years, of German
ancestry who had dilated cardiomyopathy (CMD1R; 613424), Olson et al.
(1998) found a G-to-A substitution in codon 312 in exon 5 of the ACTC
gene, resulting in an arg312-to-his (R312H) amino acid substitution. A
15-year-old son likewise had inherited the mutation but had not
developed dilated cardiomyopathy.

.0002
CARDIOMYOPATHY, DILATED, 1R
ACTC1, GLU361GLY

In a family of Swedish Norwegian ancestry, Olson et al. (1998) found
that a father and son, aged 41 and 14 years, respectively, with dilated
cardiomyopathy-1R (613424) carried a GAG (glu)-to-GGG (gly) mutation in
codon 361 in exon 6 of the ACTC gene. In addition, a 34-year-old woman
with a dilated heart and a 9-year-old with borderline heart size also
had inherited the mutation.

ACTC1, ALA295SER

In a 3-generation family with autosomal dominant hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (612098), Mogensen et al. (1999) identified a 253G-T
transversion in exon 5 of the ACTC gene resulting in an ala295-to-ser
substitution. The ala at position 295 is conserved in 19 different
species. The expression of the actin mutation in this family gave the
impression of a highly penetrant disease with diverse phenotypes and
variable age of onset. Only 1 individual of 13 family members carrying
the mutant allele was nonpenetrant, and morbidity was low, as only 3 of
the 13 carrying the mutant allele had symptoms of the disease.

In a child with idiopathic cardiac hypertrophy and presumed sporadic

CMH genes, Morita et al. (2008) identified a heterozygous C-to-T
transition in the ACTC1 gene resulting in a his90-to-tyr (H90Y)
substitution. The parents were not studied. The mutation was not found
in unrelated individuals matched by ancestral origin or in more than
1,000 control chromosomes.

.0005
ATRIAL SEPTAL DEFECT 5
ACTC1, MET123VAL

In 20 affected individuals from 2 Swedish families segregating autosomal
dominant atrial septal defect (ASD5; 612794), Matsson et al. (2008)
identified heterozygosity for a 373A-G transition in exon 2 of the ACTC1
gene, predicted to result in a met123-to-val (M123V) substitution.
Functional analysis of the M123V-mutant protein showed a reduced
affinity for myosin, but retention of actin filament polymerization and
actomyosin motor properties. The mutation was not found in 580 control
samples.

.0006
ATRIAL SEPTAL DEFECT 5
ACTC1, 17-BP DEL, NT251

In a 10-year-old girl with a secundum atrial septal defect (ASD5;
612794), Matsson et al. (2008) identified heterozygosity for a 17-bp
deletion beginning at nucleotide 251 in exon 2 of the ACTC1 gene,
predicted to result in a severely truncated protein of 86 amino acids in
length. The mutation was also identified in her clinically unaffected
43-year-old father, who was found to have an abnormal echocardiogram
with a posteriorly deviated interventricular septum, believed to be
associated with a spontaneously closed perimembranous ventricular septal
defect, causing aortic valve regurgitation. The deletion was not found
in 580 control samples.

.0007
CARDIOMYOPATHY, FAMILIAL HYPERTROPHIC, 11
ACTC1, ALA331PRO

In a 21-year-old man with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (CMH11; 612098),
Olson et al. (2000) identified heterozygosity for a G-C transversion in
exon 6 of the ACTC1 gene, resulting in an ala331-to-pro (A331P)
substitution at a highly conserved residue. The patient presented at 8
years of age with 2 near-syncopal episodes and was diagnosed with
idiopathic CMH. At 10 years of age, he was resuscitated from ventricular
fibrillation that occurred while running, and a defibrillator was
placed. Cardiac evaluation revealed hypertrophy of the septum and left
ventricular apex. His unaffected parents did not carry the mutation, nor
was it found in 150 unrelated controls.

.0008
CARDIOMYOPATHY, FAMILIAL HYPERTROPHIC, 11
ACTC1, PRO164ALA

In a 12-year-old boy with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy-11 (612098), Olson
et al. (2000) identified heterozygosity for a C-G transversion in exon 2
of the ACTC1 gene, resulting in a pro164-to-ala (P164A) substitution at
a highly conserved residue. The patient was diagnosed with CMH at 17
months of age due to syncopal episodes. He later had occasional episodes
of chest pain, dyspnea, and near-syncope, and underwent insertion of a
pacemaker. Cardiac evaluation revealed hypertrophy of the septum and
left ventricular apex. His unaffected parents did not carry the
mutation, nor was it found in 150 unrelated controls.

Using a new numbering system, Arad et al. (2005) designated this
mutation GLU101LYS (E101K).

In 7 affected members of a 4-generation family segregating autosomal
dominant hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (CMH11; 612098), Olson et al.
(2000) identified heterozygosity for a G-A transition in exon 2 of the
ACTC1 gene, resulting in a glu99-to-lys (GLU99LYS) substitution at a
highly conserved residue. Apical left ventricular hypertrophy was
present in 5 cases and a trabeculated apex in 2 cases; 2 individuals
also had marked hypertrophy of the interventricular septum without left
ventricular outflow obstruction, and 1 had an atrial septal defect.

In affected members of 2 families segregating autosomal dominant apical
CMH over 3 generations, Arad et al. (2005) identified heterozygosity for
the E101K mutation in the ACTC1 gene. A shared haplotype was also
identified, providing odds greater than 100:1 that E101K represents a
founding mutation in the 2 families; however, haplotype data indicated
that E101K arose independently in the family reported by Olson et al.
(2000). Of 18 mutation-positive individuals studied by Arad et al.
(2005), 2 individuals, ages 10 and 29 years, had no clinical evidence of
cardiomyopathy. Isolated apical hypertrophy was found in 5 individuals;
11 others also had mild thickening of the basal segments and/or
involvement of the midventricular segment, and 2 also had trabeculation
of the apex. Right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy in 1 patient
revealed myocyte hypertrophy and disarray with extensive replacement
fibrosis that was more marked than that typically seen in CMH associated
with other morphologic patterns of hypertrophy.

Monserrat et al. (2007) screened 247 probands with CMH, dilated
cardiomyopathy (CMD), or left ventricular noncompaction (see LVNC4,
613424) for the E101K mutation, and identified the mutation in 4
probands with CMH and 1 with LVNC. The 5 mutation-positive families, 2
of which were previously studied by Arad et al. (2005), were all from
the same local area in Galicia, Spain, and shared the same 88-bp allele
of the intragenic ACTC1 microsatellite marker that cosegregated with
disease in the families, suggesting a likely founder effect. Of 46
family members with CMH, 23 fulfilled criteria for LVNC, 22 were
diagnosed with apical CMH, and 3 had been diagnosed with restrictive
cardiomyopathy. Septal defects were identified in 9 mutation carriers
from 4 families (8 atrial defects and 1 ventricular), and were absent in
relatives without the mutation. The E101K mutation was not found in 48
unaffected family members. Monserrat et al. (2007) concluded that LVNC
and CMH may appear as overlapping entities, and that E101K should be
considered in the genetic diagnosis of LVNC, apical CMH, and septal
defects.

In a 15-year-old girl and an unrelated 38-year-old woman with LVNC,
Klaassen et al. (2008) identified heterozygosity for the E101K mutation
in the ACTC1 gene. Both had inherited the mutation from their affected
fathers; haplotype analysis excluded a common ancestor. All 4 patients
had noncompaction of the apex and midventricular wall and no other
congenital cardiac anomalies.

608271	TITLE *608271 MICROTUBULE-ACTIN CROSS-LINKING FACTOR 1; MACF1
;;MACROPHIN 1;;
TRABECULIN-ALPHA;;
ACTIN CROSS-LINKING FACTOR 7; ACF7;;
KIAA1251
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ACF7 is a member of the spectraplakin family of cytoskeletal
cross-linking proteins that possess actin- and microtubule-binding
domains (Kodama et al., 2003).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned MACF1, which they designated
KIAA1251. The 3-prime UTR of the transcript contains Alu repeat
sequences, and the deduced protein contains 1,483 amino acids. RT-PCR
ELISA detected low expression of MACF1 in lung, ovary, and liver.

Sun et al. (1999) cloned several contiguous partial MACF1 cDNAs from a
prostate cDNA library and assembled the full-length sequence. The
deduced 5,373-amino acid MACF1 protein, which they designated
trabeculin-alpha, has a calculated molecular mass of 614 kD. MACF1 has
an N-terminal actin-binding domain, followed by a plectin (601282)-like
domain, 29 central spectrin (see 182860)-like repeats, and a C-terminal
region that contain 2 tandem Ca(2+)-binding EF-hand motifs, a GAR22
(GAS2L1; 602128)-like domain, and a serine-rich region. The C terminus
also has several putative tyrosine kinase motifs. MACF1 shares 88% amino
acid with its mouse homolog. Northern blot analysis detected MACF1
expression in all tissues examined, with highest expression in heart,
skeletal muscle, prostate, intestine, colon, and gonads. Lowest
expression was in brain, spleen, thymus, liver, placenta, and lung.
Immunofluorescence analysis of several cell lines detected MACF1
distributed in a filamentous network throughout the cytoplasm, with
exclusion from the nucleus.

By PCR of the HepG2 hepatoma cell line with degenerate primers based on
conserved C-terminal domains of FAK (600758) and CAKB (601212), followed
by screening a HepG2 cell line cDNA library, Okuda et al. (1999) cloned
MACF1, which they designated macrophin. The deduced 5,430-amino acid
protein has a calculated molecular mass of 620 kD. RT-PCR detected high
expression in heart, placenta, liver, kidney, and pancreas, moderate
expression in brain and lung, and weak expression in skeletal muscle. In
situ hybridization of pancreas showed mRNA mainly in acinar tissue.

By searching sequence databases using a chicken partial cDNA that was
differentially expressed during regeneration of the auditory epithelium
after noise trauma, followed by screening pituitary gland and heart cDNA
libraries, Gong et al. (2001) cloned a splice variant of MACF1. The
deduced protein, which they called MACF1-4, has a calculated molecular
mass of 670 kD, contains 8 N-terminal plectin repeats, and has no
actin-binding domain. The authors noted that 3 other splice variants
with different N termini had been identified for mouse Macf1. mRNA dot
blot analysis showed that MACF1 was expressed ubiquitously, with highest
expression in pituitary, adrenal, thyroid, salivary gland, mammary
gland, pancreas, heart, and skeletal muscle. mRNA dot blot analysis
using a riboprobe specific for the MACF1-4 variant showed highest
expression in heart, lung, pituitary gland, and placenta. PCR analysis
using MACF1-4-specific primers detected MACF1-4 in lung, heart,
pituitary, and placenta, but not in brain, kidney, liver, pancreas,
skeletal muscle, or HepG2 hepatoma cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By sedimentation binding assay, Sun et al. (1999) confirmed that the
N-terminal actin-binding domain of MACF1 coprecipitated with F-actin.
Cytochalasin D disruption of actin filaments also resulted in a marked
but incomplete disruption of MACF1 fine filament structures and the
appearance of punctate aggregates of MACF1. Mouse Macf1 mRNA levels
increased steadily during formation of fused myotubes during
differentiation in a mouse myoblasts cell line. Kodama et al. (2003)
showed that mouse Acf7 is an essential integrator of microtubule-actin
dynamics. In mouse endodermal cells, Acf7 bound along microtubules, but
concentrated at their distal ends and at cell borders when polarized. In
the absence of Acf7, microtubules still bound Eb1 (603108) and Clip170
(179838), but they no longer grew along polarized actin bundles, nor did
they pause and tether to actin-rich cortical sites. The consequences
were long, less stable microtubules with skewed cytoplasmic trajectories
and altered dynamic instability. In response to wounding, Acf7 null
cultures activated polarizing signals, but they failed to maintain them
and coordinate migration. Rescue of these defects required the actin-
and microtubule-binding domains of Acf7. Kodama et al. (2003) concluded
that spectraplakins are important for controlling microtubule dynamics
and reinforcing links between microtubules and polarized F-actin, so
that cellular polarization and coordinated cell movements can be
sustained.

Chen et al. (2006) found that siRNA knockdown of Macf1 inhibited Wnt
signaling (see WNT1; 164820) in a mouse embryonic carcinoma cell line.
Reporter gene assays indicated that Macf1 acted upstream of Gsk3b
(605004) in the Wnt signaling pathway. Macf1 interacted directly with
Axin (see AXIN1, 603816) and translocated with the Axin complex to the
cell membrane upon Wnt stimulation.

A resident population of adult stem cells (SCs) in hair follicles is
involved in hair growth and in epidermal reepithelialization during
wound healing. Wu et al. (2011) found that adult mouse hair follicle SCs
expressed high levels of Acf7 and that phosphorylation of Acf7 by
Gsk3-beta reduced the affinity of Acf7 for microtubules. Expression of a
constitutively active Gsk3-beta mutant in hair follicle SCs resulted in
elevated phosphorylation of Acf7 and altered microtubule structure
similar to that in Acf7-knockout cells. Conversely, inhibition of
Gsk3-beta increased microtubule binding by endogenous Acf7 in hair
follicle SCs. SC migration in a wound-healing assay was inhibited by
Acf7 knockout and by both over- and underactivation of Gsk3-beta. Wu et
al. (2011) concluded that cyclic phosphorylation of Acf7 by Gsk3-beta is
required for Acf7- and microtubule-based cell migration in hair follicle
SCs.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gong et al. (2001) determined that the MACF1 gene contains at least 102
exons and spans more than 270 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1999) mapped the MACF1 gene
to chromosome 1. Okuda et al. (1999) mapped the MACF1 gene to chromosome
1p32-p31 by radiation hybrid analysis and genomic sequence analysis. By
FISH, Sun et al. (1999) mapped the MACF1 gene to chromosome 1p34.2-p33.
Gong et al. (2001) mapped the mouse Macf1 gene to a region of mouse
chromosome 4 that shows homology of synteny to human chromosome 1p32.

ANIMAL MODEL

Chen et al. (2006) found that Macf1 -/- mice died at the gastrulation
stage and displayed developmental retardation at embryonic day 7.5 with
defects in the formation of the primitive streak, node, and mesoderm.
The phenotype was similar to that of Wnt3 (165330)-null mice and Lrp5
(604506)/Lrp6 (603507) double-knockout mice.

601814	TITLE *601814 FXYD DOMAIN-CONTAINING ION TRANSPORT REGULATOR 2; FXYD2
;;SODIUM-POTASSIUM-ATPase, GAMMA-1 POLYPEPTIDE; ATP1G1
DESCRIPTION The gene family FXYD (pronounced fix-id) consists of small membrane
proteins containing a core motif of 35 invariant and conserved amino
acids centered on a single transmembrane span.

CLONING

Kim et al. (1997) cloned a cDNA encoding the sodium-potassium-ATPase
gamma-subunit polypeptide from a human fetal liver cDNA library. The
deduced amino acid sequence of the protein comprises 58 amino acids with
a calculated molecular weight of 6,400 Da and shows about 86% homology
when compared with those of the bovine, rat, and mouse gamma subunits.
Northern blot analysis showed that the cDNA hybridizes to a 0.7-kb mRNA
that is expressed in human kidney, pancreas, and fetal liver. See ATP1A1
(182310).

By EST database searching and in silico analysis, Sweadner and Rael
(2000) identified genes and protein sequences for 7 FXYD molecules in
rodents and humans. The deduced FXYD2 protein, the smallest of the 7,
has 2 variants. The gamma-b isoform contains 66 amino acids and has no
signal peptide. Sweadner and Rael (2000) noted that ESTs for FXYD2 are
found in muscle, blood, and transport tissues, particularly kidney, but
not in nervous system tissues, suggesting wide but not ubiquitous
expression.

Sweadner et al. (2000) purified Na,K-ATPase-enriched membranes from rat
and human kidneys. By Western blot analysis, they confirmed that both
rat and human FXYD2 proteins migrate as doublets, with apparent
molecular masses of 7.9 and 6.9 kD.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sweadner et al. (2000) determined that the FXYD2 gene contains 7 exons
and spans 9.2 kb. They identified 2 alternatively spliced exons encoding
different N termini as well as 2 candidate promoters with consensus
sites for transcription factors SP1, AP1 and AP2, consistent with
independent transcription of the splice variants. The gene has a high
concentration of repeat elements.

MAPPING

Annabi et al. (1998) mapped the gene for glycogen storage disease Ib
(232220) to a 3-cM region on 11q23, between markers D11S939 and
D11S4129. They found that the IL10R (146933), ATP1G1, and ALL1 (159555)
genes were present in the same interval, in that order from centromere
to telomere.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Morth et al. (2007) presented the x-ray crystal structure at
3.5-angstrom resolution of the pig renal sodium-potassium-ATPase
(Na+,K(+)-ATPase) with 2 rubidium ions bound (as potassium congeners) in
an occluded state in the transmembrane part of the alpha-subunit.
Several of the residues forming the cavity for rubidium/potassium
occlusion in the Na+,K(+)-ATPase are homologous to those binding calcium
in the calcium-ion ATPase of sarcoendoplasmic reticulum (SERCA1;
108730). The beta and gamma subunits specific to the Na+,K(+)-ATPase are
associated with transmembrane helices alpha-M7/alpha-M10, and alpha-M9,
respectively. The gamma subunit corresponds to a fragment of the V-type
ATPase c subunit. The carboxy terminus of the alpha subunit is contained
within a pocket between transmembrane helices and seems to be a novel
regulatory element controlling sodium affinity, possibly influenced by
the membrane potential.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Autosomal dominant isolated renal magnesium loss (154020) is due to loss
of magnesium in the kidney. It is usually associated with lowered
urinary excretion of calcium, presumably as a consequence of increased
reabsorption of calcium in the loop of Henle. By a candidate gene
approach, following mapping of the disorder to 11q23, Meij et al. (2000)
identified a putative dominant-negative mutation in the gene encoding
the Na+,K(+)-ATPase gamma subunit (601814.0001), leading to defective
routing of the protein, which failed to find its way to the plasma
membrane. This is a small, type I membrane protein localized on
basolateral membranes of nephron epithelial cells and expressed in the
distal convoluted tubule, the main site of active renal Mg(2+)
reabsorption. This was said to be the first time that mutations in a
gene encoding an Na+,K(+)-ATPase subunit had been implicated in human
disease.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPOMAGNESEMIA 2, RENAL
FXYD2, GLY41ARG

In patients with dominant isolated renal magnesium loss (154020), Meij
et al. (2000) identified a heterozygous mutation, 121G-A, in the FXYD2
gene that cosegregated with the disorder. The mutation caused a
substitution of the conserved glycine-41 within the putative
transmembrane domain by arginine.

611748	TITLE *611748 OTU DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 7B; OTUD7B
;;CELLULAR ZINC FINGER ANTI-NFKB;;
CEZANNE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to A20 (TNFAIP3;
191163), followed by RACE PCR of human peripheral blood lymphocyte cDNA,
Evans et al. (2001) cloned OTUD7B, which they called Cezanne. The
deduced protein contains more than 800 amino acids and has an N-terminal
TRAF (see TRAF1; 601711)-binding domain, a putative nuclear localization
signal, and a C-terminal A20-like zinc finger domain. Northern blot
analysis detected a major 6-kb transcript in human epithelial cells and
fibroblasts and in a liver carcinoma cell line. Epithelial cells and
fibroblasts also expressed a minor 9.5-kb transcript. Both transcripts
were detected in human tissues, with prominent expression in heart.
RT-PCR showed highest levels of Cezanne in kidney, heart, and fetal
liver. Fluorescence-tagged Cezanne distributed diffusely within the
cytoplasm of fibroblasts and epithelial cells and showed some nuclear
staining in endothelial cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Evans et al. (2001) showed that expression of Cezanne in HEK293 human
embryonic kidney cells reduced NF-kappa-B (see 164011) activity in a
dose-dependent manner following stimulation with TNF-alpha (TNF;
191160). When overexpressed in HEK293 cells, exogenous A20, Cezanne, and
TRABID (ZRANB1; 611749) coimmunoprecipitated with TRAF6 (602355).

Evans et al. (2003) reported that the N-terminal catalytic domain of
Cezanne is similar to the OTU superfamily of proteins, which share
structural similarity with cysteine proteinases. They identified Cezanne
as a deubiquitinating enzyme. Recombinant Cezanne cleaved ubiquitin
monomers from linear or branched synthetic ubiquitin chains and from
ubiquitinated proteins. Mutation of a conserved cysteine (cys209) in the
catalytic site of the proteolytic domain caused Cezanne to coprecipitate
polyubiquitinated cellular proteins. In addition to the N-terminal
catalytic domain, a C-terminal domain was required for efficient
hydrolysis of both free and conjugated forms of branched ubiquitin
chains.

Hu et al. (2013) identified the deubiquitinase OTUD7B as a pivotal
regulator of the noncanonical NF-kappa-B pathway. OTUD7B deficiency in
mice has no appreciable effect on canonical NF-kappa-B activation but
causes hyperactivation of noncanonical NF-kappa-B. In response to
noncanonical NF-kappa-B stimuli, OTUD7B binds and deubiquitinates TRAF3
(601896), thereby inhibiting TRAF3 proteolysis and preventing aberrant
noncanonical NF-kappa-B activation. Consequently, the OTUD7B deficiency
results in B-cell hyperresponsiveness to antigens, lymphoid follicular
hyperplasia in the intestinal mucosa, and elevated host-defense ability
against an intestinal bacterial pathogen, Citrobacter rodentium. Hu et
al. (2013) concluded that their findings established OTUD7B as a crucial
regulator of signal-induced noncanonical NF-kappa-B activation, and
indicated a mechanism of immune regulation that involves OTUD7B-mediated
deubiquitination and stabilization of TRAF3.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the OTUD7B
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP G20321).

604696	TITLE *604696 A-KINASE ANCHOR PROTEIN 11; AKAP11
;;A-KINASE ANCHOR PROTEIN, 220-KD; AKAP220
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

A-kinase anchor proteins (AKAPs; see 602449) direct the activity of
protein kinase A (PKA; see 176911) by tethering the enzyme near its
physiologic substrates.

CLONING

By screening rat pituitary and olfactory bulb cDNA libraries with a PKA
type II regulatory (RII) probe, Lester et al. (1996) identified a novel
AKAP, AKAP11, which the authors designated AKAP220. The AKAP11 protein
has 1,129 amino acids and contains a PKA-binding region and a peroxisome
targeting motif. Immunohistochemical analysis of rat testis cells showed
that AKAP220 and a proportion of RII PKA are colocalized in microbodies
that appear to be a subset of peroxisomes. By RT-PCR analysis, Ishikawa
et al. (1998) detected expression of human AKAP11 in heart, brain, lung,
liver, kidney, testis, and ovary, with weaker expression in skeletal
muscle, pancreas, and spleen.

GENE FUNCTION

Logue et al. (2011) showed that AKAP220 interacts with the cytoskeletal
scaffolding protein IQGAP1 (603379) at the leading edges of migrating
cells. The AKAP220/IQGAP1 complex was proposed to form a component of a
microtubule-associated network of several proteins, including CLASP2
(605853), that receive and process calcium and cAMP second messenger
signals. Silencing of the AKAP220 gene retarded cell migration in human
cancer cells.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1998) mapped the AKAP11
gene, which they designated KIAA0629, to human chromosome 13.

612824	TITLE *612824 SEC14-LIKE 3; SEC14L3
;;SEC14, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF, 3;;
TOCOPHEROL-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 2; TAP2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database analysis of the region surrounding human TAP1 (SEC14L2;
607558), followed by RT-PCR analysis of human lung total RNA, Kempna et
al. (2003) cloned SEC14L3 and SEC14L4 (612825), which they called TAP2
and TAP3, respectively. SEC14L3 shares 86% similarity with SEC14L2. All
3 proteins share residues glu185 and lys216, which are predicted to play
a role in phospholipid binding and transfer activity in S. cerevisiae
Sec14. RT-PCR of human tissues and cell lines detected SEC14L3
expression in all tissues examined, with lower expression in skin,
blood, and liver. Immunocytochemical studies localized SEC14L3 to
intracellular membranes of the cytoplasm in HeLa cells, including
partial localization to the ER and Golgi, with more intense staining
surrounding but not within the nucleus.

Ye et al. (2004) independently cloned SEC14L3 as part of a large-scale
sequencing of human fetal brain cDNAs. The deduced 400-amino acid
protein has a calculated molecular mass of 46.1 kD. SEC14L3 has a
conserved CRAL/TRIO domain and shares 76% homology to SEC14L2. In
contrast to Kempna et al. (2003), Ye et al. (2004) detected SEC14L3
expression in liver only by RT-PCR analysis.

GENE FUNCTION

Kempna et al. (2003) showed that in HeLa cells deletion of the
C-terminal Golgi dynamics (GOLD) domain reduced SEC14L3 localization in
the region surrounding the nucleus with an increase in staining of
larger granules. They suggested that the SEC14L3 GOLD domain may play a
role in docking to other proteins or in intracellular transport of bound
ligands. Using several assays, Kempna et al. (2003) demonstrated that
SEC14L3 bound tocopherol, squalene, and phospholipids
(phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylglycerol).
Although SEC14L3 bound phospholipids, it failed to complement an S.
cerevisiae temperature-sensitive Sec14 allele in yeast. Using
immunoprecipitation assays, Kempna et al. (2003) showed that SEC14L3 may
interact with and regulate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity and
that SEC14L3 displayed low basal GTPase activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kempna et al. (2003) determined that the SEC14L3 gene contains 12 exons,
and Ye et al. (2004) stated that these 12 exons span 12.8 kb.

MAPPING

By database analysis, Kempna et al. (2003) mapped the SEC14L3 gene to
chromosome 22q12.1-qter, where it lies within 100 kb of the SEC14L2 and
SEC14L4 genes. Ye et al. (2004) independently mapped SEC14L3 to
chromosome 22q12 by database analysis.

;;BONE MORPHOGENETIC PROTEIN, PLACENTA; PLAB;;
PROSTATE-DERIVED FACTOR; PDF;;
MACROPHAGE-INHIBITING CYTOKINE 1; MIC1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

GDF15 is a distant member of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP; see
112264) subfamily of the transforming growth factor-beta (see TGFB1;
190180) superfamily. GDF15 is weakly expressed under normal conditions,
but it is sharply upregulated during inflammation and acts as an
autocrine regulator of macrophage activation. In addition to its effects
on macrophages, GDF15 is a downstream target of p53 (TP53; 191170) that
may be involved in the injury response to DNA damage and in cancer
(summary by de Jager et al., 2011).

CLONING

By screening a full-length cDNA library constructed from a fibrosarcoma
cell line for secretory proteins, Yokoyama-Kobayashi et al. (1997)
isolated a cDNA encoding a 308-amino acid protein related to TGFB.
Northern blot analysis detected strongest expression of a 1.35-kb
transcript in placenta, with lower levels in prostate and colon and some
expression in kidney. By searching an EST database for TGFB/BMP-related
sequences, Hromas et al. (1997) identified a cDNA encoding an identical
protein, which they called PLAB (placental BMP). Through analysis of
hematopoietic progenitor proliferation, they found that PLAB reduces the
growth of granulocytes and macrophages.

By searching an EST database, followed by screening a placenta cDNA
library, Paralkar et al. (1998) isolated a cDNA encoding PLAB, which
they called PDF (prostate-derived factor). Western blot analysis showed
that PDF is expressed as a 16-kD protein under reducing conditions. In
situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that
PDF is expressed at high levels in cells of the terminal villi in
placenta and in the epithelium of prostate but not in other accessory
male genital glands.

Using subtraction cloning in a monocyte/macrophage cell line, Bootcov et
al. (1997) isolated a cDNA encoding PLAB, which they called MIC1
(macrophage-inhibiting cytokine-1). Sequence analysis predicted that the
mature secreted MIC1 protein contains 224 amino acids. Northern blot
analysis showed that MIC1 is not expressed in undifferentiated cells but
is progressively upregulated upon differentiation with retinoic acid
followed by phorbol ester or cytokine (e.g., TNFA; 191160) treatment.
Exposure of macrophages to MIC1 or TGFB1, followed by stimulation with
lipopolysaccharide, suppressed the production of TNFA.

Unlike most TGFB superfamily members, in which the amino acid sequence
is completely conserved, MIC1 shares only 70% amino acid identity with
its rodent counterparts (Bottner et al., 1999).

GENE STRUCTURE

Bottner et al. (1999) determined that the MIC1 gene is composed of 2
exons separated by an approximately 3-kb intron.

MAPPING

Using FISH, Bottner et al. (1999) mapped the MIC1 gene to 19p13.2-p13.1.

GENE FUNCTION

Moore et al. (2000) used a sensitive sandwich enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for quantification of MIC1 to examine the
role of this cytokine in pregnancy. High levels of MIC1 are present in
the sera of pregnant women; the levels rise substantially with progress
of gestation. MIC1 is also present in large amounts in amniotic fluid
and placental extracts. In addition, the BeWo placental trophoblastic
cell line constitutively expresses the MIC1 transcript and secretes
large amounts of MIC1. The authors concluded that the placental
trophoblast is a major source of the MIC1 present in maternal serum and
amniotic fluid. They inferred that MIC1 may promote fetal survival by
suppressing the production of maternally derived proinflammatory
cytokines within the uterus.

Tong et al. (2004) measured serum concentrations of MIC1 in 100
asymptomatic women at 6 to 13 weeks' gestation who subsequently
miscarried or who had already miscarried. Their MIC1 concentrations were
one-third of those measured in 197 patients who had ongoing pregnancies.
Concentrations were just as low 3 weeks before diagnosis as on the day
of diagnosis, suggesting possible predictive and causative roles.

Johnen et al. (2007) found that nude mice injected with human prostate
cancer cells stably expressing MIC1 showed weight loss that correlated
with levels of serum MIC1. Weight loss was due to reduced food intake
and could be reversed by treatment with anti-MIC1. Tumor size was not
affected by anti-MIC1. Elevated serum MIC1 levels correlated with
greater weight loss in patients with advanced prostate cancer and lower
body mass index in patients with chronic renal failure. Transgenic mice
overexpressing Mic1 were smaller and ate less than wildtype mice.
Injection of Mic1 activated hypothalamic, notably arcuate, neurons
through Tgfbr2 (190182), as demonstrated by enhanced Fos (164810) and
Stat3 (102582) expression. Hypothalamic overexpression of Mic1 induced
rapid weight loss in mice. Johnen et al. (2007) concluded that MIC1 is a
central regulator of appetite and weight and is a potential target for
treatment of cancer, anorexia, and weight loss.

Tanno et al. (2007) hypothesized that accumulation of iron in the
absence of blood transfusions in thalassemia patients may result from
inappropriate suppression of the iron-regulating peptide hepcidin
(606464) by an erythropoietic mechanism. To test this hypothesis, Tanno
et al. (2007) examined erythroblast transcriptome profiles from 15
healthy nonthalassemic donors. GDF15 showed increased expression and
secretion during erythroblast maturation. Healthy volunteers had mean
GDF15 serum concentrations of 450 +/- 50 pg/ml. In comparison,
individuals with beta-thalassemia syndromes had elevated GDF15 serum
levels (mean 66,000 +/- 9,600 pg/ml; range 4,800-248,000 pg/ml; P less
than 0.05) that were positively correlated with the levels of soluble
transferrin receptor (190010), erythropoietin (133170), and ferritin
(see 134790). Serum from thalassemia patients suppressed hepcidin mRNA
expression in primary human hepatocytes, and depletion of GDF15 reversed
hepcidin suppression. Tanno et al. (2007) concluded that GDF15
overexpression arising from an expanded erythroid compartment
contributes to iron overload in thalassemia syndromes by inhibiting
hepcidin expression.

Kempf et al. (2011) observed that GDF15 expression increased in mouse
and human heart within hours after myocardial infarction and remained
elevated in the infarcted myocardium for several days. They found that
Gdf15 -/- mice exhibited greatly increased mortality compared with
wildtype mice following coronary artery ligation. These Gdf15 -/- mice
showed increased myocardial rupture and hemothorax and an enhanced
inflammatory reaction characterized by elevated infiltration of the
infarcted area with polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and elevated
Mmp9 (120361) expression and activity. Recombinant human GDF15 inhibited
mouse and human PMN adhesion and transmigration by inhibiting beta-2
integrin (ITGB2; 600065) clustering and activation. GDF15 inhibited
integrin activation by interfering with activation of the small GTPase
Rap1 (RAP1A; 179520) and by directly activating the small GTPase Cdc42
(116952). Kempf et al. (2011) concluded that GDF15 functions as an
antiinflammatory cytokine by directly interfering with chemokine
signaling and integrin activation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

MIC1 is expressed in activated but not resting macrophages. Two allelic
forms of the MIC1 gene were identified by Fairlie et al. (2001), one of
which has a SNP causing a his6-to-asp substitution in the MIC1 protein.
The homozygous asp (D) allele is present in approximately 5% of normal
individuals. Because of the different properties of the amino acids, the
polymorphism could alter the function of MIC1. Brown et al. (2002) noted
that activated macrophages have been implicated in the pathogenesis of
atherosclerosis and vascular occlusion and that strong epidemiologic
data have linked measurement of inflammatory markers such as C-reactive
protein (123260) and interleukin-6 (147620) with risk of vascular
occlusive events. As part of the Women's Health Study, a large primary
prevention trial of aspirin and vitamin E in American women, Brown et
al. (2002) investigated the possible relationship between MIC1
concentration in plasma and risk of cardiovascular events in women.
Plasma MIC1 concentrations were higher at baseline in women who
subsequently had cardiovascular events than in those who did not.
Concentrations above the 90th percentile were associated with a 2.7-fold
increase in risk. The effect was independent of traditional
cardiovascular risk factors and at least additive to that of C-reactive
protein. There was no significant association between the MIC1
polymorphism identified by Fairlie et al. (2001) and vascular events.

ANIMAL MODEL

De Jager et al. (2011) noted that elevated GDF15 serum levels are
associated with risk for acute coronary syndromes. They found that Gdf15
expression was upregulated in a mouse model of atherosclerosis.
Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated colocalization of Gdf15 with
plaque macrophages. Hematopoietic cells lacking Gdf15 in Ldlr (606945)
-/- mice had impaired initial lesion formation due to reduced Ccr2
(601267) chemotaxis and increased collagen in later lesions. De Jager et
al. (2011) concluded that GDF15 deficiency improves atherosclerotic
plaque stability by enhancing collagen deposition and decreasing
necrotic core expansion.

607351	TITLE *607351 RHO-RELATED BTB DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; RHOBTB1
;;KIAA0740
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the RHOBTB subfamily of Rho GTPases are evolutionarily
conserved. They are characterized by a modular organization, consisting
of a GTPase domain, a proline-rich region, a tandem of 2 BTB (broad
complex, tramtrack, and bric-a-brac) domains, and a conserved C-terminal
region. The BTB domain, also known as a POZ (poxvirus and zinc finger)
domain, is involved in protein-protein interactions.

CLONING

By randomly sequencing clones from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) obtained a cDNA encoding RHOBTB1, which
they called KIAA0740. The deduced protein contains 532 amino acids and
shares 39% identity with RAC1 (602048). RT-PCR followed by ELISA
revealed ubiquitous but variable expression, with highest levels in
skeletal muscle, kidney, and ovary.

By searching an EST database, Ramos et al. (2002) obtained full-length
cDNAs encoding RHOBTB1, RHOBTB2 (607352), and RHOBTB3 (607353). RHOBTB1
contains all the domains characteristic of RHOBTB proteins. The
C-terminal domain consists of about 80 amino acids in 4 consecutive
alpha helices, with the last third having a high content of charged
residues. RHOBTB1 and RHOBTB2 share 77% nucleotide identity, and RHOBTB1
shares 84% nucleotide identity with mouse Rhobtb1. Northern dot blot
analysis revealed ubiquitous expression of RHOBTB1, with highest levels
in skeletal muscle, placenta, testis, stomach, and kidney, followed by
uterus and adrenal gland. RHOBTB1 was expressed in a variety of fetal
tissues. In mouse, expression of Rhobtb1 was highest in heart and
testis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ramos et al. (2002) determined that the RHOBTB1 gene contains 9 exons
and spans about 75 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Ramos et al. (2002) mapped the RHOBTB1
gene to chromosome 10q21.1, downstream of the CDC2 gene (116940) and
upstream of the EGR2 gene (129010).

612655	TITLE *612655 TBC1 DOMAIN FAMILY, MEMBER 7; TBC1D7
;;CELL MIGRATION-INDUCING PROTEIN 23;;
PIG51;;
TBC7
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TBC1D7 belongs to a family of proteins sharing a 180- to 200-amino acid
TBC domain presumed to have a role in regulating cell growth and
differentiation. These proteins share significant homology with TRE2
(USP6; 604334), yeast Bub2, and CDC16 (603461) (Nakashima et al., 2007).

CLONING

Nakashima et al. (2007) identified TBC1D7, which they called TBC7, by
coimmunoprecipitation with the tuberous sclerosis complex proteins TSC1
(605284) and TSC2 (191092) from transfected HEK293 cells. The deduced
293-amino acid TBC1D7 protein contains a putative TBC domain. SDS-PAGE
showed that TBC1D7 was expressed as a 30-kD protein. Northern blot
analysis detected an approximately 1.1-kb transcript with high
expression in human heart and low expression in kidney, liver, and
placenta. Immunofluorescence studies colocalized TBC1D7 and TSC1 to the
cytoplasm when expressed in NIH3T3 cells; with subcellular
fractionation, TBC1D7 localized to the cytoplasmic vesicles of the
endomembrane in a complex with TSC1-TSC2.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoblot and GST pull-down assay, Nakashima et al. (2007) confirmed
that TBC1D7 interacted with the TSC1-TSC2 complex. Further studies
showed that TBC1D7 interacted directly with TSC1 through the C-terminal
half of the TSC1 coiled-coil domain. Overexpression of TBC1D7 caused an
increase in phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 protein (RPS6; 180460) at
ser235/236 by RPS6 kinase (RPS6KB1; 608938) activation, suggesting that
TBC1D7 plays a role in positive regulation of the mTOR-signaling
pathway. Overexpression of TBC1D7 also increased TSC1 ubiquitination.

602123	TITLE *602123 CALCIUM/CALMODULIN-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE II-GAMMA; CAMK2G
;;CaM KINASE II GAMMA SUBUNIT;;
CAMKG
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) is a
ubiquitous serine/threonine protein kinase that has been implicated in
diverse effects of hormones and neurotransmitters that utilize Ca(2+) as
a second messenger. The enzyme is an oligomeric protein composed of
distinct but related subunits, alpha (114078), beta (607707), gamma, and
delta (607708), each encoded by a separate gene. Each subunit has
alternatively spliced variants.

CLONING

Breen and Ashcroft (1997) cloned and sequenced a novel CaM kinase
II-gamma cDNA from human islet cell RNA. This isoform, designated
gamma-SRP by the authors, encodes a truncated gamma CaM kinase II in
which the 3-prime end consists of 804 basepairs of the human SRP72 gene
(602122).

Tombes and Krystal (1997) identified a number of CAMKG variants
expressed by neuronal cells. Two variants were consistently expressed in
nonneuronal cell lines, and another was preferentially expressed in
tumor cells.

MAPPING

Using somatic cell hybrid analysis and fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Li et al. (1994) mapped the CAMK2G gene to human
chromosome 10q22. Ahmed et al. (2001) stated that CAMK2G is 1 of 3 genes
that are nested in the introns of PCDH15 (605514).

GENE FUNCTION

In mouse cardiomyocytes, Zhu et al. (2003) demonstrated that
beta-1-adrenergic receptor (ADRB1; 109630)-induced apoptosis was
resistant to inhibition of PKA (see 176911). Rather, the Adrb1
proapoptotic effect was associated with non-Pka-dependent increases in
intracellular Ca(2+) and Camk2 activity. Blocking the L-type Ca(2+)
channel (see 114205), buffering intracellular Ca(2+), or inhibiting
Camk2 activity fully protected cardiomyocytes against Adrb1-induced
apoptosis; overexpressing the c splice variant of Camk2d markedly
exaggerated the Adrb1 apoptotic effect. Zhu et al. (2003) concluded that
CAMK2 constitutes a PKA-independent linkage of ADRB1 stimulation to
cardiomyocyte apoptosis.

Among 304 Swiss individuals tested and genotyped, de Quervain and
Papassotiropoulos (2006) found a significant association (p = 0.00008)
between short-term episodic memory performance and genetic variations in
a 7-gene cluster consisting of the ADCY8 (103070), PRKACG (176893),
CAMK2G, GRIN2A (138253), GRIN2B (138252), GRM3 (601115), and PRKCA
(176960) genes, all of which have well-established molecular and
biologic functions in animal memory. Functional MRI studies in an
independent set of 32 individuals with similar memory performance showed
a correlation between activation in memory-related brain regions,
including the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus, and genetic
variability in the 7-gene cluster. De Quervain and Papassotiropoulos
(2006) concluded that these 7 genes encode proteins of the memory
formation signaling cascade that are important for human memory
function.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

For discussion of mutation in the CAMK2G gene as a possible cause of an
intellectual disability phenotype, see 602123.0001.

ANIMAL MODEL

To study the role of CaMKII in T cells, Bui et al. (2000) generated
transgenic mice expressing a partially calcium-independent mutant form
of CAMKG (thr287 to asp). The size of the thymus was increased 1.5- to
2-fold in these mice, at least in part due to an increase in the life
span of double-positive thymocytes. There was an increase in the number
of T cells in the secondary lymphoid organs that had acquired an
antigen-dependent memory phenotype. These T cells were bona fide memory
cells as assessed by a variety of criteria. In addition, T cells from
wildtype mice acquired calcium-independent CaMKII activity after several
rounds of antigen-stimulated division. The authors proposed that CaMKII
controls a distinct process of activation-induced cellular
differentiation.

Using gene targeting, Zhang et al. (2005) developed a mouse model of
cardiac Camk2 inhibition and demonstrated substantial prevention of
maladaptive remodeling from excessive beta-adrenergic receptor
stimulation and myocardial infarction, and induction of balanced changes
in excitation-contraction coupling that preserved baseline and
beta-adrenergic receptor-stimulated physiologic increases in cardiac
function. Zhang et al. (2005) concluded that CAMK2 is a determinant of
clinically important heart disease phenotypes.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
CAMK2G, ARG292PRO

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to intellectual disability has not been confirmed.

In a boy with severe intellectual disability with self mutilation,
myopia, strabismus, mitochondrial dysfunction without mitochondrial gene
defects, short stature, flat face with narrow forehead, long palpebral
fissures, arched eyebrows, sacral dimple, short hands, brachydactyly,
and short feet, de Ligt et al. (2012) identified a de novo heterozygous
875G-C transversion resulting in an arg29-to-pro (R29P) substitution.
The patient had normal array and MLL2 testing.

615187	TITLE *615187 POST-GPI ATTACHMENT TO PROTEINS 2; PGAP2
;;FGF RECEPTOR-ACTIVATING PROTEIN 1; FRAG1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) modification of plasma membrane
proteins occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and GPI-anchored
proteins are incorporated into rafts in the Golgi during their transport
to the cell surface. PGAP2 appears to be involved in maturation of the
GPI anchor on GPI-anchored proteins (Tashima et al., 2006).

CLONING

By screening an M426 human embryonic fibroblast cell line with rat
Frag1, Lorenzi et al. (1999) cloned PGAP2, which they called FRAG1. The
deduced 316-amino acid protein has 2 N-terminal FRAG1 homology (FH)
domains and 4 possible isoprenylation signals. Hydropathy analysis
suggested that FRAG1 has 7 transmembrane segments. Human and rat FRAG1
share 92% amino acid identity, but the rat protein has only 1 FH domain.
Northern blot analysis detected variable expression of a 2.0-kb FRAG1
transcript in all 16 tissues examined, with highest expression in testis
and pancreas, and lowest expression in brain and thymus. A transcript of
about 3.2 kb was also detected in several tissues, predominantly
pancreas, spleen, and prostate. FRAG1 was also detected in a number of
tumor cell lines at a level comparable to that observed in normal
tissues.

By database analysis and cloning using rat and hamster cDNA libraries,
Tashima et al. (2006) identified human, rat, and hamster cDNAs encoding
a 254-amino acid PGAP2 protein. They also identified a splice variant in
human and hamster that encodes a 250-amino acid isoform lacking a VSQE
sequence. Rat Pgap2 localized to Golgi in transfected NRK cells.

Hansen et al. (2013) stated that the PGAP2 gene encodes 16 different RNA
transcripts, 8 of which encode different isoforms and 8 that are
noncoding RNA. Isoform 8, which is 254 amino acids long and contains 5
alpha-helix domains embedded in the Golgi membrane, is believed to be
the biologically active isoform. The N terminus is in the cytoplasm and
the C terminus is in the Golgi lumen.

GENE FUNCTION

Tashima et al. (2006) found that transfected CHO cells lacking Pgap2
were deficient in cell surface expression of the human GPI-anchored
proteins CD59 (107271) and CD55 (125240). Cotransfection of rat Pgap2 or
the human or hamster variant encoding the short PGAP2 isoform restored
CD59 surface expression. GPI-anchored proteins appeared to traffic
normally through the ER and Golgi, but they were secreted upon arrival
at the plasma membrane via phospholipid D (see 602382)-like activity.
The secreted proteins showed an altered GPI anchor. Tashima et al.
(2006) proposed that remodeling of the GPI anchor occurs in GPI-anchored
proteins, and that in Pgap2-deficient cells, this remodeling is
defective, resulting in GPI-anchored proteins that are sensitive to
cleavage then secretion from the plasma membrane.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lorenzi et al. (1999) determined that the PGAP2 gene contains 6 exons
and spans over 7 kb. The tandem FH domains in the FRAG1 protein are
encoded by exons 1 and 2.

MAPPING

Using FISH and radiation hybrid analysis, Lorenzi et al. (1999) mapped
the PGAP2 gene to chromosome 11p15.5.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 2 unrelated consanguineous families with
hyperphosphatasia with mental retardation syndrome-3 (HPMRS3; 614207),
Hansen et al. (2013) identified 2 different homozygous missense
mutations in the PGAP2 gene (615187.0001 and 615187.0002, respectively).
In vitro functional expression studies showed that the mutant alleles
were hypomorphic and caused decreased enzyme activity. Hansen et al.
(2013) commented that the disorder due to PGAP2 mutations can be viewed
as part of a disease family representing a spectrum of disorders due to
mutations in genes involved in glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor
biosynthesis. Mutations in genes earlier in the pathway appear to cause
a more severe phenotype, including dysmorphic features (e.g., MCAHS1,
614080), than mutations in genes that act later in the pathway.

Among 13 individuals with intellectual disability and increased serum
alkaline phosphatase who were screened for mutations in genes encoding
proteins in the GPI-anchor biosynthesis pathway, Krawitz et al. (2013)
found that 2 unrelated patients carried biallelic missense mutations in
the PGAP2 gene (615187.0003-615187.0005). In vitro studies showed that
the mutations caused decreased enzyme activity.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPERPHOSPHATASIA WITH MENTAL RETARDATION SYNDROME 3
PGAP2, TYR99CYS

In 3 affected members of a consanguineous Syrian family (MR043) with
autosomal recessive hyperphosphatasia with mental retardation-3 (HPMRS3;
614207) originally reported by Abou Jamra et al. (2011), Hansen et al.
(2013) identified a homozygous c.296A-G transition in the PGAP2 gene,
resulting in a tyr99-to-cys (Y99C) substitution between transmembrane
segments 1 and 2 in the Golgi lumen. The mutation, which was found by
exome sequencing of the linked region on chromosome 11p15, was confirmed
by Sanger sequencing and segregated with the disorder in the family. In
vitro functional expression studies in CHO cells showed that the mutant
protein was expressed but had significantly decreased activity compared
to wildtype. Patient lymphoblastoid cells showed essentially normal
expression of the GPI-anchored proteins DAF (125240) and CD59 (107271),
supporting a hypomorphic effect of the Y99C mutation.

.0002
HYPERPHOSPHATASIA WITH MENTAL RETARDATION SYNDROME 3
PGAP2, ARG177PRO

In affected members of a consanguineous Pakistani family (MR5) with
HPMRS3 (614207) originally reported by Rehman et al. (2011), Hansen et
al. (2013) identified a homozygous c.530G-C transversion in the PGAP2
gene, resulting in an arg177-to-pro (R177P) substitution between
transmembrane segments 3 and 4 in the Golgi lumen. The mutation, which
was found by exome sequencing of the linked region on chromosome 11p15,
was confirmed by Sanger sequencing and segregated with the disorder in
the family. In vitro functional expression studies in CHO cells showed
that the mutant protein was expressed but had significantly decreased
activity compared to wildtype. Patient lymphoblastoid cells showed
essentially normal expression of the GPI-anchored proteins DAF (125240)
and CD59 (107271), supporting a hypomorphic effect of the R177P
mutation.

.0003
HYPERPHOSPHATASIA WITH MENTAL RETARDATION SYNDROME 3
PGAP2, LEU127SER

In a Turkish boy, born of consanguineous parents, with HPMRS3 (614207),
Krawitz et al. (2013) identified a homozygous c.380T-C transition in the
PGAP2 gene, resulting in a leu127-to-ser (L127S) substitution at a
highly conserved residue. The mutation segregated with the disorder in
the family. In vitro functional expression studies showed that the
mutant protein had decreased activity compared to wildtype.

.0004
HYPERPHOSPHATASIA WITH MENTAL RETARDATION SYNDROME 3
PGAP2, ARG16TRP

In a 28-year-old Finnish woman with mild HPMRS3 (614207), Krawitz et al.
(2013) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the PGAP2
gene: a c.46C-T transition resulting in an arg16-to-trp (R16W)
substitution, and a c.479C-T transition resulting in a thr160-to-ile
(T160I; 615187.0005) substitution. Both mutations occurred at highly
conserved residues. In vitro functional expression studies showed that
the mutant proteins had decreased activity compared to wildtype. Higher
residual activity of R16W may explain the milder phenotype in this
patient.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The CDKN2A gene encodes proteins that regulate 2 critical cell cycle
regulatory pathways, the p53 (TP53; 191170) pathway and the RB1 (614041)
pathway. Through the use of shared coding regions and alternative
reading frames, the CDKN2A gene produces 2 major proteins: p16(INK4),
which is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, and p14(ARF), which binds
the p53-stabilizing protein MDM2 (164785) (Robertson and Jones, 1999).

CLONING

Using CDK4 (123829) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen, Serrano et al.
(1993) cloned human CDKN2A, which they designated p16(INK4). The deduced
148-amino acid protein contained 4 ankyrin repeats and had a calculated
molecular mass of 15.8 kD.

Kamb et al. (1994) identified a putative tumor suppressor locus in
chromosome band 9p21, within a region of less than 40 kb, by means of
analyzing homozygous deletions in melanoma cell lines. The region was
found to contain a gene, called MTS1 (for multiple tumor suppressor-1),
that encodes a previously identified inhibitor (p16) of CDK4. The
sequence of the MTS1 gene as determined by Kamb et al. (1994) was
identical to that of the p16 gene as determined by Serrano et al.
(1993).

Using a p16 probe, Stone et al. (1995) isolated 2 cDNAs that differed in
their first exons, which they called E1-alpha and E1-beta. E1-alpha
encodes the first 43 amino acids of the p16 protein. E1-beta is utilized
by a second open reading frame that encodes a protein of at least 180
amino acids, in a different reading frame relative to p16. This protein
was designated p14(ARF) (alternative reading frame). Stone et al. (1995)
also cloned 2 p16 cDNAs from mouse. The mouse and human p16 proteins
share 60% identity, but the p14(ARF) proteins share only 28% identity.
Northern blot analysis detected different ratios of both transcripts in
all human tissues examined. The ratio of the 2 variants changed
dramatically through the cell cycle in human peripheral blood
lymphocytes. As stimulated T cells entered the cell cycle, the ratio of
beta-to-alpha splice variants increased.

Stott et al. (1998) stated that the alpha transcript of CDKN2A encodes
p16(INK4a), a recognized tumor suppressor that induces a G1 cell cycle
arrest by inhibiting the phosphorylation of the Rb protein by the
cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6. The beta transcript of CDKN2A
encodes p14(ARF). The predicted 132-amino acid p14(ARF) is shorter than
the corresponding mouse protein, p19(ARF), and the 2 proteins share only
50% identity. However, both proteins have the ability to elicit a p53
(191170) response, manifest in the increased expression of both CDKN1A
(116899), also called CIP1, and MDM2 (164785), and resulting in a
distinctive cell cycle arrest in both the G1 and G2/M phases.

Robertson and Jones (1999) detected a theretofore unrecognized splice
variant of INK4a, termed p12, that arises through use of an alternative
splice donor site within intron 1. The p12 transcript produced a 12-kD
protein composed of INK4a exon 1-alpha and a novel intron-derived C
terminus. p12 contains only 1.5 of the 4 ankyrin repeats found in
p16(INK4A). Robertson and Jones (1999) showed that p12 did not interact
with CDK4, but its overexpression suppressed growth in cultured human
cervical carcinoma or pancreatic cell lines. Northern blot analysis
detected p12 transcripts in pancreas only.

Lin et al. (2007) stated that p16(INK4A) contains 156 amino acids and
has a calculated molecular mass of 16.5 kD. By RT-PCR of a human
neuroblastoma cell line, they cloned a splice variant of p16(INK4A),
p16-gamma. The transcript includes a 197-bp cryptic exon (exon 2-gamma)
from intron 2 that is spliced in-frame with p16(INK4A) exons 2 and 3.
The stop codon for p16-gamma lies within exon 2-gamma. The deduced
p16-gamma protein contains 167 amino acids and has a calculated
molecular mass of 17.9 kD. The first 152 amino acids of p16(INK4A) and
p16-gamma are identical. Biophysical analysis indicated that p16-gamma,
like p16(INK4A), is an ankyrin repeat protein. Lin et al. (2007) stated
that p14(ARF) does not contain ankyrin repeats. RT-PCR detected
p16-gamma transcripts in primary T-cell and B-cell acute lymphoblastic
leukemia patient samples and in other p16(INK4A)-expressing tumor
samples. Lower levels were detected in normal mononuclear cells and
non-tumor tissues.

Using RT-PCR, Burdon et al. (2011) demonstrated expression of CDKN2A in
human ocular tissues, including in the iris, ciliary body, retina, and
optic nerve.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kamb et al. (1994) stated that the CDKN2 gene consists of 3 coding
exons: exon 1 (E1), containing 125 basepairs; E2, containing 307
basepairs; and E3, containing just 12 basepairs.

Stone et al. (1995) determined that the CDKN2A gene spans 30 kb. Exon
E1-beta is the most 5-prime of the p16 exons. Lin et al. (2007)
identified an alternatively spliced exon, called 2-gamma, between exon
E1-alpha and exon 2 of the CDKN2A gene.

Quelle et al. (1995) found that in mouse, as in human, the INK4 locus
gives rise to 2 distinct transcripts from different promoters. Each
transcript has a specific 5-prime exon, E1-alpha or E1-beta, which is
spliced into common exons E2 and E3. The E1-alpha-containing transcript
encodes p16(INK4a) and the E1-beta-containing transcript encodes
p19(ARF) from a different AUG initiated in the E1-beta exon. Both
p19(ARF) and p16(INK4a) induced growth arrest in mammalian fibroblasts.

MAPPING

The p16 gene (CDKN2A) was mapped to 9p21 (Kamb et al., 1994; Nobori et
al., 1994). This same region has frequently been involved in deletions
and rearrangements in dysplastic nevi (Cowan et al., 1988), a major
precursor lesion of melanoma, and in cutaneous malignant melanoma, or
CMM (Fountain et al., 1992), and was shown by Petty et al. (1993) to be
involved in a constitutional deletion in a patient with multiple primary
melanomas. A locus for familial malignant melanoma, symbolized CMM2
(155601), has been mapped to 9p21. Kamb et al. (1994) noted that
chromosome region 9p21 is involved in chromosomal inversions,
translocations, heterozygous deletions, and homozygous deletions in a
variety of malignant cell lines including those from glioma, nonsmall
cell lung cancer, leukemia, and melanoma. Deletion of 9p21 markers is
found in more than half of all melanoma cell lines. These findings
suggested to Kamb et al. (1994) that 9p21 contains a tumor suppressor
locus that may be involved in the genesis of several tumor types.

Quelle et al. (1995) mapped the p16(INK4a) and p15(INK4b) genes to
position C3-C6 on mouse chromosome 4 in a region syntenic with human
chromosome 9p.

GENE FUNCTION

Kamb et al. (1994) found that MTS1 was homozygously deleted at high
frequency in cell lines derived from tumors of lung, breast, brain,
bone, skin, bladder, kidney, ovary, and lymphocyte. Melanoma cell lines
carried at least one copy of MTS1 in combination with a deleted allele.
Melanoma cell lines that carried at least 1 copy of MTS1 frequently
showed nonsense, missense, or frameshift mutations in the gene. Thus,
MTS1 may rival p53 (191170) in the universality of its involvement in
tumorigenesis. Furthermore, it illustrates, as does p53, the
relationship between the tumor suppressor genes and the regulation of
the cell cycle.

Quelle et al. (1995) showed that the protein p19(ARF) arises in major
part from an alternative reading frame of the mouse INK4a gene, and that
its ectopic expression in the nucleus of rodent fibroblasts induces G1
and G2 phase arrest. The authors noted that economical reutilization of
coding sequences in this manner is practically without precedent in
mammalian genomes, and they speculated that the unitary inheritance of
p16(INK4a) and p19(ARF) may underlie their dual requirement in cell
cycle control. A somewhat similar situation was reported by Labarriere
et al. (1995) who found that transcripts originating from a novel
promoter in the human growth hormone gene GH1 (139250) have the
potential to specify a 107-amino acid protein, the C-terminal half of
which arises from a second reading frame in GH exons 1 and 2. Antibodies
to the C terminus of this predicted polypeptide histochemically stained
a subpopulation of pituitary cells, arguing for limited focal
translation of this mRNA.

The frequent deletion or mutation of CDKN2A in tumor cells suggests that
p16 acts as a tumor suppressor. Lukas et al. (1995) showed that wildtype
p16 arrests normal diploid cells in late G1, whereas a tumor-associated
mutant of p16 does not. Significantly, the ability of p16 to induce cell
cycle arrest was lost in cells lacking functional RB1 protein (614041).
Thus, loss of p16, overexpression of D-cyclins, and loss of
retinoblastoma have similar effects on G1 progression, and may represent
a common pathway to tumorigenesis. The mutation used by Lukas et al.
(1995) in their studies was a C-to-T transition changing proline-114 to
leucine and had been observed in 3 independent melanoma cell lines. Koh
et al. (1995) reported similar results. They demonstrated that p16 can
act as a potent and specific inhibitor of progression through the G1
phase of the cell cycle and that several tumor-derived alleles of p16
encode functionally compromised proteins. In vivo, the presence of
functional retinoblastoma protein appeared to be necessary but may not
be sufficient to confer full sensitivity to p16-mediated growth arrest.
In addition to the P114L allele, they used an asp74-to-asn (D74N)
mutant, a de novo somatic mutation isolated independently from tumors of
the esophagus and bladder; an asp84-to-asn (D84N) mutation found in a
survey of esophageal squamous cell carcinomas; and several other
mutations associated with melanoma.

Using amplification of polyadenylated mRNA by PCR, Quelle et al. (1995)
observed no expression of mouse p16 in many normal tissues, whereas p15
was expressed ubiquitously.

By immunohistochemical analysis of archival paraffin specimens and tumor
cell lines, Kratzke et al. (1995) found that p16(INK4) was expressed in
a nonsmall cell lung cancer cell line but not in 12 of 12 primary
thoracic mesotheliomas (156240) and 15 of 15 mesothelioma cell lines.
All tumor specimens and the tumor cell lines showed expression of
wildtype retinoblastoma protein. In addition, transfection of CDKN2
suppressed the growth of 2 independent mesothelioma cell lines. The
authors concluded that inactivation of the CDKN2 gene is an essential
step in the etiology of malignant mesotheliomas.

Serrano et al. (1996) proposed that the absence of p16(INK4a)
contributes significantly to the tumor susceptibility phenotype. Kamijo
et al. (1997) used a conventional targeting vector to ablate the mouse
p19(ARF) exon 1b in mouse embryonic stem cells, replacing it with a
neomycin-resistant gene. The expression of the p16(INK4a) gene was not
abolished. Mice lacking p19(ARF) but expressing functional p16(INK4a)
developed tumors early in life. Their embryo fibroblasts did not senesce
and were transformed by oncogenic Ha-ras alone. Conversion of
p16(ARF)+/+ or p16(ARF)+/- mouse embryo fibroblasts to continuously
proliferating cell lines involved loss of either p19(ARF) or p53.
Checkpoint control mediated by p53 was unperturbed in p19(ARF)-null
fibroblasts, whereas p53-negative cell lines were resistant to
p19(ARF)-induced growth arrest. Kamijo et al. (1997) concluded that
INK4a encodes growth inhibitory proteins that act upstream of the
retinoblastoma protein and p53. They suggested that mutations and
deletions targeting this locus in cancer cells are unlikely to be
functionally equivalent.

Splicing of alternative first exons (1-alpha vs 1-beta) to a common
second exon within the INK4A gene generates mRNAs in which exon 2
sequences are translated in 2 different reading frames. One of the
products, the cyclin D-dependent kinase inhibitor p16, is functionally
inactivated by mutations or deletions in a wide variety of cancers;
however, because many such mutations occur in exon 2, they also affect
the alternative reading frame (ARF) protein. To determine whether such
mutations disrupt p19(ARF) function, Quelle et al. (1997) introduced
naturally occurring missense mutations into mouse Ink4a exon 2 sequences
and tested mutant p16 and p19 proteins for their ability to inhibit cell
cycle progression. Six p19(ARF) point mutants remained fully active in
mediating cell cycle arrest in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, whereas 2 of the
corresponding mutations within p16 resulted in complete loss of
activity. Analysis of p19(ARF) deletion mutants indicated that the
unique N-terminal domain encoded by exon 1-beta was both necessary and
sufficient for inducing cell cycle G1 arrest. Therefore, they concluded
that cancer-associated mutations within exon 2 of the INK4A gene
specifically target p16 and not p19 for inactivation.

Zhang et al. (1998) stated that the 2 unrelated proteins encoded by the
INK4A-ARF locus function in tumor suppression. Zhang et al. (1998)
showed that ARF binds to MDM2 (164785) and promotes the rapid
degradation of MDM2. This interaction is mediated by the E1-beta-encoded
N-terminal domain of ARF and a C-terminal region of MDM2. ARF-promoted
MDM2 degradation is associated with MDM2 modification and concurrent p53
(191170) stabilization and accumulation. The functional consequence of
ARF-regulated p53 levels via MDM2 proteolysis is evidenced by the
ability of ectopically expressed ARF to restore a p53-imposed G1 cell
cycle arrest that is otherwise abrogated by MDM2. Thus, Zhang et al.
(1998) concluded that deletion of the ARF-INK4A locus simultaneously
impairs the INK4A--cyclin D/CDK4--RB and the ARF--MDM2--p53 pathways.

Pomerantz et al. (1998) showed that p19(ARF) potently suppresses
oncogenic transformation in primary cells and that this function is
abrogated when p53 is neutralized by viral oncoproteins and
dominant-negative mutants but not by the p53 antagonist MDM2. This
finding, coupled with the observations that p19(ARF) and MDM2 physically
interact and that p19(ARF) blocks MDM2-induced p53 degradation and
transactivational silencing, suggests that p19(ARF) functions to prevent
the neutralization of p53 by MDM2. Pomerantz et al. (1998) suggested
that INK4A has a potent tumor suppressor activity to the cooperative
actions of its 2 protein products and their relation to the 2 central
growth control pathways, Rb and p53.

Zhang and Xiong (1999) reported that the human ARF protein predominantly
localizes to the nucleolus via a sequence within the exon 2-encoded
C-terminal domain and is induced to leave the nucleolus by MDM2. ARF
forms nuclear bodies with MDM2 and p53 and blocks p53 and MDM2 nuclear
export. Tumor-associated mutations in exon 2 of the ARF-INK4a locus
disrupted the nucleolar localization of ARF and reduced its ability to
block p53 nuclear export and to stabilize p53. These results suggested
an ARF-regulated MDM2-dependent p53 stabilization and linked the human
tumor-associated mutations in the ARF-INK4a locus with a functional
alteration.

Vivo et al. (2001) performed coimmunoprecipitation and transfection
experiments demonstrating that the C-terminal region of spinophilin
(PPP1R9B; 603325) interacts with ARF in vitro and in mammalian cells.
Studies with deletion mutants showed that the first 65 amino acids in
the N terminus of ARF are necessary for this interaction. Ectopic
expression in different human and mouse cell lines showed that
spinophilin reduced the number of G418-resistant colonies with an
efficiency similar to or higher than that of ARF; this effect was
independent of the status of p53, Rb, and ARF. Coexpression of
ARF/spinophilin in Saos-2 cells suggested synergistic activity.

The p16(INK4A) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor is implicated in
replicative senescence, the state of permanent growth arrest provoked by
cumulative cell divisions or as a response to constitutive Ras-Raf-MEK
signaling in somatic cells. Ohtani et al. (2001) demonstrated a role for
the ETS1 (164720) and ETS2 (164740) transcription factors in regulating
the expression of p16(INK4A) in these different contexts based on their
ability to activate the p16(INK4A) promoter through an ETS binding site
and their patterns of expression during the life span of human diploid
fibroblasts. The induction of p16(INK4A) by ETS2, which is abundant in
young human diploid fibroblasts, is potentiated by signaling through the
Ras-Raf-MEK kinase cascade and inhibited by a direct interaction with
the helix-loop-helix protein ID1 (600349). In senescent cells, where the
ETS2 levels and MEK signaling decline, the marked increase in p16(INK4A)
expression is consistent with the reciprocal reduction of ID1 and
accumulation of ETS1.

Linggi et al. (2002) demonstrated that p14(ARF) is a direct
transcriptional target of the AML1-ETO (133435) fusion gene that results
from the t(8;21) translocation associated with acute leukemia.
Repression of p14(ARF) may explain why p53 is not mutated in
t(8;21)-containing leukemias and suggests that p14(ARF) is an important
tumor suppressor in a large number of human leukemias.

In mouse embryo fibroblasts, Qi et al. (2004) showed that p19(Arf) can
inhibit c-Myc (190080) by a unique and direct mechanism that is
independent of p53. When c-Myc increased, p19(Arf) bound with c-Myc and
dramatically blocked c-Myc's ability to activate transcription and
induce hyperproliferation and transformation. In contrast, c-Myc's
ability to repress transcription was unaffected by p19(Arf), and
c-Myc-mediated apoptosis was enhanced. These differential effects of
p19(Arf) on c-Myc function suggested that separate molecular mechanisms
mediate c-Myc-induced hyperproliferation and apoptosis. This direct
feedback mechanism represents a p53-independent checkpoint to prevent
c-Myc-mediated tumorigenesis.

Gonzalez et al. (2006) identified a putative DNA replication origin at
the INK4/ARF locus that assembles a multiprotein complex containing CDC6
(602627), ORC2 (601182), and minichromosome maintenance proteins (MCMs),
and that coincide with a conserved noncoding DNA element, regulatory
domain RD(INK4/ARF). Targeted and localized RNA interference-induced
heterochromatinization of RD(INK4/ARF) resulted in transcriptional
repression of the locus, revealing that RD(INK4/ARF) is a relevant
transcriptional regulatory element. CDC6 is overexpressed in human
cancers, where it might have roles in addition to DNA replication.
Gonzalez et al. (2006) found that high levels of CDC6 resulted in
RD(INK4/ARF)-dependent transcriptional repression, recruitment of
histone deacetylases, and heterochromatinization of the INK4/ARF locus,
and a concomitant decrease in the expression of the 3 tumor suppressors
encoded by this locus. Gonzalez et al. (2006) suggested that this
mechanism is reminiscent of the silencing of the mating-type HM loci in
yeast by replication factors. Consistent with its ability to repress the
INK4/ARF locus, CDC6 had cellular immortalization activity and
neoplastic transformation capacity in cooperation with oncogenic Ras
(see 190020). Furthermore, human lung carcinomas with high levels of
CDC6 were associated with low levels of p16(INK4a). Gonzalez et al.
(2006) concluded that aberrant expression of CDC6 is oncogenic by
directly repressing the INK4/ARF locus through the RD(INK4/ARF) element.

Reef et al. (2006) identified mouse and human smARF, a short
mitochondrial form of p19(ARF) that results from initiation of
translation at met45 in mice and met48 in humans. smARF lacks the
N-terminal nucleolar localization signal and several functional domains
of p19(ARF) and represents a small fraction of total p19(ARF) in vivo.
Mouse smARF localized to mitochondria and caused dissipation of
mitochondrial membrane potential independent of p53 (191170) and Bcl2
(151430) family members without releasing cytochrome c. Overexpression
of smARF led to induction of massive autophagy and to
caspase-independent cell death.

Janzen et al. (2006) reported that the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor
p16(INK4a), the level of which increases in other cell types with age,
accumulates and modulates specific age-associated hematopoietic stem
cell functions. Notably, in the absence of p16(INK4a), hematopoietic
stem cell repopulating defects and apoptosis were mitigated, improving
the stress tolerance of cells and the survival of animals in successive
transplants, a stem cell-autonomous tissue regeneration model. Janzen et
al. (2006) suggested that inhibition of p16(INK4a) may ameliorate the
physiologic impact of aging on stem cells and thereby improve injury
repair in aged tissue.

Molofsky et al. (2006) showed that progenitor proliferation in the
subventricular zone and neurogenesis in the olfactory bulb, as well as
multipotent progenitor frequency and self-renewal potential, all decline
with age in the mouse forebrain. These declines in progenitor frequency
and function correlate with increased expression of p16(INK4a), which
encodes a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor linked to senescence. Aging
p16(INK4a)-deficient mice showed a significantly smaller decline in
subventricular zone proliferation, olfactory bulb neurogenesis, and the
frequency and self-renewal potential of multipotent progenitors.
p16(INK4a) deficiency did not detectably affect progenitor function in
the dentate gyrus or enteric nervous system, indicating regional
differences in the response of neural progenitors to increased
p16(INK4a) expression during aging. Molofsky et al. (2006) concluded
that declining subventricular zone progenitor function and olfactory
bulb neurogenesis during aging are caused partly by increasing
p16(INK4a) expression.

Krishnamurthy et al. (2006) showed that p16(INK4a) constrains islet
proliferation and regeneration in an age-dependent manner. Expression of
the p16(INK4a) transcript is enriched in purified islets compared with
the exocrine pancreas, and islet-specific expression of p16(INK4a), but
not other cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, increases markedly with
aging. To determine the physiologic significance of p16(INK4a)
accumulation on islet function, Krishnamurthy et al. (2006) assessed the
impact of p16(INK4a) deficiency and overexpression with increasing age
and in the regenerative response after exposure to a specific islet
beta-cell toxin. Transgenic mice that overexpress p16(INK4a) to a degree
seen with aging demonstrated decreased islet proliferation. Similarly,
islet proliferation was unaffected by p16(INK4a) deficiency in young
mice, but was relatively increased in p16(INK4a)-deficient old mice.
Survival after toxin-mediated ablation of beta-cells, which requires
islet proliferation, declined with advancing age; however, mice lacking
p16(INK4a) demonstrated enhanced islet proliferation and survival after
beta-cell ablation. Krishnamurthy et al. (2006) concluded that these
genetic data supported the view that an age-induced increase of
p16(INK4a) expression limits the regenerative capacity of beta-cells
with aging.

Lin et al. (2007) showed that human p16-gamma interacts with CDK4 and
inhibited its kinase activity. Using a reporter gene assay, transfection
of p16-gamma repressed the E2F response (see E2F1, 189971), the
downstream target of RB1, with an efficacy equivalent to that of
p16(INK4A). Moreover, p16-gamma, like p16(INK4A), induced cell cycle
arrest at G0/G1, and inhibited cell growth in a human osteosarcoma cell
line in a colony formation assay.

Li et al. (2009) showed that the Ink4/Arf locus, comprising
Cdkn2a-Cdnk2b (600431), is completely silenced in induced pluripotent
stem (iPS) cells as well as in embryonic stem cells, acquiring the
epigenetic marks of a bivalent chromatin domain, and retaining the
ability to be reactivated after differentiation. Cell culture conditions
during reprogramming enhance the expression of the Ink4/Arf locus,
further highlighting the importance of silencing the locus to allow
proliferation and reprogramming. Indeed, Oct4 (164177), Klf4 (602253),
and Sox2 (184429) together repress the Ink4/Arf locus soon after their
expression and concomitant with the appearance of the first molecular
markers of 'stemness.' This downregulation also occurs in cells carrying
the oncoprotein simian virus-40 'large-T' antigen, which functionally
inactivates the pathways regulated by the Ink4/Arf locus, thus
indicating that the silencing of the locus is intrinsic to reprogramming
and not the result of a selective process. Genetic inhibition of the
Ink4/Arf locus has a profound positive effect on the efficiency of iPS
cell generation, increasing both the kinetics of reprogramming and the
number of emerging iPS cell colonies. In murine cells, Arf, rather than
Ink4a, is the main barrier to reprogramming by activation of p53 and p21
(CDKN1A; 116899) whereas in human fibroblasts, INK4a is more important
than ARF. Furthermore, organismal aging upregulates the Ink4/Arf locus
and, accordingly, reprogramming is less efficient in cells from old
organisms, but this defect can be rescued by inhibiting the locus with a
short hairpin RNA. Li et al. (2009) concluded that the silencing of
Ink4/Arf locus is rate-limiting for reprogramming, and its transient
inhibition may significantly improve the generation of iPS cells.

Utikal et al. (2009) noted that the reprogramming potential of primary
murine fibroblasts into iPS cells decreases after serial passaging and
the concomitant onset of senescence. They demonstrated that cells with
low endogenous p19(Arf) protein levels and immortal fibroblasts
deficient in components of the Arf-Trp53 pathway yield iPS cell colonies
with up to 3-fold faster kinetics and at a significantly higher
efficiency than wildtype cells, endowing almost every somatic cell with
the potential to form iPS cells. Notably, the acute genetic ablation of
p53 in cellular subpopulations that normally fail to reprogram rescues
their ability to produce iPS cells. The results of Utikal et al. (2009)
showed that the acquisition of immortality is a crucial and
rate-limiting step towards the establishment of a pluripotent state in
somatic cells and underscored the similarities between induced
pluripotency and tumorigenesis.

Chen et al. (2010) reported that ARF is very unstable in normal human
cells but that its degradation is inhibited in cancer cells. Through
biochemical purification, Chen et al. (2010) identified a specific
ubiquitin ligase for ARF and named it ULF (604506). ULF interacts with
ARF both in vitro and in vivo and promotes the lysine-independent
ubiquitylation and degradation of ARF. ULF knockdown stabilizes ARF in
normal human cells, triggering ARF-dependent p53-mediated growth arrest.
Moreover, nucleophosmin (NPM; 164040) and c-Myc (190080), both of which
are commonly overexpressed in cancer cells, are capable of abrogating
ULF-mediated ARF ubiquitylation through distinct mechanisms, and thereby
promote ARF stabilization in cancer cells. Chen et al. (2010) concluded
that their findings revealed the dynamic feature of the ARF-p53 pathway
and suggested that the transcription-independent mechanisms are
critically involved in ARF regulation during responses to oncogenic
stress.

Baker et al. (2011) used a biomarker for senescence, p16(Ink4a), to
design a novel transgene, INK-ATTAC, for inducible elimination of
p16(Ink4a)-positive senescent cells upon administration of a drug. Baker
et al. (2011) showed that in the BubR1 (602860) progeroid mouse
background, INK-ATTAC removes p16(Ink4a)-positive senescent cells upon
drug treatment. In tissues such as adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and
eye, in which p16(Ink4a) contributes to the acquisition of age-related
pathologies, lifelong removal of p16(Ink4a)-expressing cells delayed
onset of these phenotypes. Furthermore, late-life clearance attenuated
progression of already established age-related disorders. Baker et al.
(2011) concluded that cellular senescence is causally implicated in
generating age-related phenotypes and that removal of senescent cells
can prevent or delay tissue dysfunction and extend 'healthspan.'

Braumuller et al. (2013) showed that the combined action of the T
helper-1-cell cytokines IFN-gamma (IFNG; 147570) and tumor necrosis
factor (TNF; 191160) directly induces permanent growth arrest in
cancers. To safely separate senescence induced by tumor immunity from
oncogene-induced senescence, Braumuller et al. (2013) used a mouse model
in which the Simian virus-40 large T antigen (Tag) expressed under the
control of the rat insulin promoter creates tumors by attenuating p53
(191170)- and Rb (614041)-mediated cell cycle control. When combined,
Ifng and Tnf drive Tag-expressing cancers into senescence by inducing
permanent growth arrest in G1/G0, activation of p16Ink4a, and downstream
Rb hypophosphorylation at ser795. This cytokine-induced senescence
strictly requires Stat1 (600555) and Tnfr1 (TNFRSF1A; 191190) signaling
in addition to p16Ink4a. In vivo, Tag-specific T-helper-1 cells
permanently arrest Tag-expressing cancers by inducing Ifng- and
Tnfr1-dependent senescence. Conversely, Tnfr1-null Tag-expressing
cancers resist cytokine-induced senescence and grow aggressively, even
in Tnfr1-expressing hosts. Braumuller et al. (2013) concluded that as
IFNG and TNF induce senescence in numerous murine and human cancers,
this may be a general mechanism for arresting cancer progression.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The p16 protein binds to CDK4 (123829) and inhibits the ability of CDK4
to interact with cyclin D and stimulate passage through the G1 phase of
the cell cycle (Serrano et al., 1993). Deletions or mutations in the p16
gene may affect the relative balance of functional p16 and cyclin D,
resulting in abnormal cell growth. Kamb et al. (1994) and Nobori et al.
(1994) observed a high frequency of p16 deletions and mutations in many
tumor cell lines, which supported the above model and suggested that p16
has a pivotal role in inhibiting the development of human cancers. On
the other hand, studies by Cairns et al. (1994), demonstrating a much
lower frequency of mutations in primary tumors, suggested that the high
frequency of p16 mutations observed in cell lines are in vitro artifacts
and not evidence of a major role of the gene in the development of a
wide variety of malignancies.

Inactivation of tumor suppressor genes by large deletions, intragenic
mutations, altered splicing and promoter mutations may not be the only
mechanism leading to tumorigenesis. Merlo et al. (1995) showed that
although LOH on 9p21 is one of the most frequent genetic alterations
identified in human cancer, point mutations of p16 on the other
chromosome are relatively rare. They showed that monosomic cell lines
with structurally unaltered p16 contained methylation of the 5-prime CpG
island of the p16 gene. This distinct methylation pattern was associated
with a complete transcriptional block that was reversible upon treatment
with 5-deoxyazacytidine. Moreover, de novo methylation of the 5-prime
CpG island of p16 was found in approximately 20% of different primary
neoplasms, but not in normal cells, potentially representing a common
pathway of tumor suppressor gene inactivation in human cancers. Little
and Wainwright (1995) raised the possibility that the aberrant
methylation of p16 may reflect the activity of a p16-specific
'imprintor.' The isolation of a p16 imprintor gene would be an exciting
development in cancer biology. As tumorigenesis often apes embryology,
such an imprintor may be necessary to 'switch off' p16-driven inhibition
of cell proliferation during certain stages of development. The findings
of Merlo et al. (1995) suggested that gene-specific methylation is
another way to 'suppress the suppressors.' In their brief review, Little
and Wainwright (1995) speculated: 'If methylation of (the) p16 (gene) is
the driving force behind the tumour, could p16 be specifically
demethylated?'

Hinshelwood et al. (2009) investigated the temporal progression of DNA
methylation and histone remodeling in the p16(INK4A) CpG island in
primary human mammary epithelial cell (HMEC) strains during selection,
as a model for early breast cancer. Gene silencing occurred prior to de
novo methylation and histone remodeling. An increase in DNA methylation
was associated with a rapid loss of both histone H3K27 trimethylation
and H3K9 acetylation and a gradual gain of H3K9 dimethylation.
Regional-specific 'seeding' methylation occurred early after
post-selection, and the de novo methylation pattern observed in HMECs
correlated with the apparent footprint of nucleosomes across the
p16(INK4A) CpG island. Hinshelwood et al. (2009) concluded that CDKN2A
gene silencing is a precursor to epigenetic suppression; subsequent de
novo methylation initially occurs in nucleosome-free regions across the
p16(INK4A) CpG island, and this is associated with a dynamic change in
histone modifications.

McKenzie et al. (2010) assessed the utility of different assays in
predicting functional effects of CDKN2A mutations. They evaluated 28
different mutations, including missense, truncating, and intragenic
deletions for binding affinity to CDK4 and CDK6, cell-cycle inhibitory
activity, and subcellular distribution. There were varying results, with
some mutant proteins showing features similar to wildtype, and others
causing disruption of normal function. Almost all mutant proteins showed
a decrease in binding to CDK4, and most showed altered subcellular
localization in a punctate or speckled pattern. McKenzie et al. (2010)
concluded that a combination of assays to determine CDK4 binding
affinity and assays to determine subcellular distribution in mammalian
cells can provide a rapid and accurate assessment of CDKN2A mutation
function. CDK6-binding activity, in silico analysis, and Ki67 (176741)
expression were not useful adjuncts.

- Role in Pancreatic Cancer

Caldas et al. (1994) concluded that the CDKN2A gene is frequently the
site of mutations causing pancreatic adenocarcinoma. They had noted a
high frequency of allelic loss at 9p, including 9p21, in cases of
pancreatic adenocarcinoma. This tumor characteristically generates an
intense host desmoplastic reaction, and primary tumor tissue contains a
high admixture of contaminating nonneoplastic inflammatory and stromal
cells. For this reason, and because of the difficulty in establishing
pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells in culture, Caldas et al. (1994) took
advantage of xenograft explants. The analysis of MTS1 in 27 xenografted
pancreatic carcinomas and 10 pancreatic carcinoma cell lines showed
homozygous deletions in 15 (41%) and sequence changes in 14 (38%).
Sequencing of MTS1 from primary tumors confirmed the mutations.
Coexistent inactivation of both MTS1 and p53 (191170) was common.
Bartsch et al. (1995) found somatic CDKN2 mutations in 11 of 32
pancreatic adenocarcinomas. One tumor appeared to have a homozygous
deletion of CDKN2.

Liu et al. (1995) found that exons 1 and 2 of the MTS1 gene were deleted
in 50% of pancreatic cancer cell lines. The region 9p22-p21, where the
MTS1 gene is located, had been observed to show frequent loss of
heterozygosity (LOH) in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas and
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas.

Mutation in CDKN2A can cause a syndrome of pancreatic cancer and
melanoma (see 606719).

In a population-based study, Ghiorzo et al. (2012) identified CDKN2A
mutations in 13 (5.7%) of 225 Italian patients with pancreatic cancer.
Six patients carried the common G101W mutation (600160.0005), which was
the most common mutation. Among the 16 probands with a family history of
cancer, including pancreatic and melanoma, 5 (31%) were found to carry
CDKN2A mutations. The mutation frequency ranged from 20% in families
with 2 affected members to 50% in families with 3 affected members. The
findings suggested that CDKN2A is the main susceptibility gene in
Italian families with pancreatic cancer.

Harinck et al. (2012) identified CDKN2A mutations in 6 (21%) of 28
families ascertained for familial clustering of pancreatic cancer. Five
of the 6 families were of Caucasian origin and carried the same Dutch
founder Leiden mutation (19-bp del; 600160.0003). Four of the 5 families
with the Leiden mutation had members who developed melanoma. In the
fifth family, only pancreatic cancer segregated with mutation status. A
sixth family, of Indonesian origin, with only pancreatic cancer and no
melanoma carried a different heterozygous mutation in the CDKN2A gene
(600160.0022). Harinck et al. (2012) concluded that the CDKN2A gene
should be analyzed in families with pancreatic cancer, even if melanoma
is not present.

- Role in Esophageal and Gastric Cancers

Igaki et al. (1994) found homozygous deletion of p16 in 12 of 13
esophageal cancer cell lines and in 2 of 9 gastric cancer cell lines.
They also found that p16 gene loss, cyclin D1 (168461), and p53 gene
mutations occurred independently in these cell lines. They interpreted
these results as indicating that changes in the p16 gene are involved in
most esophageal cancers and play a critical role in the development of
this type of malignancy.

Liu et al. (1995) found that exons 1 and 2 of the MTS1 gene were deleted
in 67% of esophageal squamous cancer cell lines examined.

Serrano et al. (2000) analyzed gastrinomas from 44 patients for CDKN2A
gene mutations and correlated the results to the tumor's biologic
behavior, growth pattern, and aggressiveness. No gastrinomas had
mutations of exon 1 or exon 2 of CDKN2A, although polymorphisms were
found in 54%. No homozygous deletions were found. In 52% of the
gastrinomas, hypermethylation of a 5-prime CpG island of the CDKN2A
promoter was found. The presence or absence of methylation of the CDKN2A
gene did not correlate with clinical characteristics of the gastrinoma,
biologic behavior (gastrin release and basal or maximal acid output),
the presence or absence of known prognostic factors (tumor size,
gastrinoma location, lymph node metastases, liver metastases, and
curability), or growth pattern of the gastrinoma postresection. The
authors concluded that methylation of the CDKN2A gene is probably a
central process in the molecular pathogenesis of these tumors.

- Role in Leukemia

By Southern blot analysis, Ogawa et al. (1994) found that both alleles
of the CDK4 inhibitor gene were completely or partially deleted in human
leukemia cells derived from leukemia patients and from established cell
lines. Homozygous deletion was found in 14 of 37 (38%) cell lines and 4
of 72 (6%) samples from leukemia patients, including 45 with acute
myelocytic leukemia, 14 with acute lymphocytic leukemia, and 13 with
chronic myelocytic leukemia in blastic crisis. All 4 leukemia patients
with homozygous deletion of CDKN2A had acute lymphocytic leukemia; 2 of
them had no cytogenetic abnormality of chromosome 9. Hebert et al.
(1994) likewise found homozygous MTS1 deletions in 20 of 24 cases of
T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia; homozygous MTS1 deletions were
found in only 2 of 31 B-lineage cases (P less than 0.001). The deletions
involved MTS1 and MTS2 (CDKN2B; 600431) in most cases. In only 5 cases
(4 T and 1 B), deletions involving MTS1 spared the MTS2 gene.

Hemizygous deletions and rearrangements of 9p21 are among the most
frequent cytogenetic abnormalities detected in pediatric acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), occurring in approximately 10% of cases.
To determine if the p16(INK4a) locus and the tandemly linked p15(INK4b)
locus might be the target of these chromosomal lesions, Okuda et al.
(1995) analyzed both genes in primary clinical samples from 43 pediatric
ALL patients using interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization,
Southern blot analysis, and PCR. Deletion of the 2 genes was identified
in 18 of 20 cases with cytogenetically observed abnormalities of 9p and
in 5 of 23 cases with apparently normal chromosomes 9p, with the
majority containing biallelic deletions (16 homozygous and 7
hemizygous). Although most homozygous deletions involved both genes,
Southern blot analysis showed an interstitial deletion in a single case
that was confined to p16(INK4a), suggesting that p15(INK4b) was not the
critical target gene in this case. Sequence analysis of both genes in
all 7 cases with hemizygous deletions failed to show mutations within
the coding regions of the retained alleles.

Using data from a genomewide association study of 907 individuals with
childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 2,398 controls and with
validation in samples totaling 2,386 cases and 2,419 controls, Sherborne
et al. (2010) demonstrated that common variation at 9p21.3 (dbSNP
rs3731217, intron 1 of CDKN2A) influences acute lymphoblastic leukemia
risk with an odds ratio = 0.71, P = 3.01 x 10(-11), irrespective of cell
lineage.

- Role in Bladder Cancer

In a screen for deletions and sequence variants of p16 in 140 bladder
tumors and 16 bladder tumor cell lines, Williamson et al. (1995) found
homozygous deletion of p16 in 8 cell lines and small sequence variations
in 2. All 13 tumors with small defined deletions of 9p21, 18/31 (58%) of
tumors with monosomy 9, and 9/91 (10%) of tumors with no chromosome 9
LOH had homozygous deletion of p16. No tumor-specific sequence variants
were identified. Deletion mapping revealed a nested set of deletions
focused on p16. The p16 gene, but not the related adjacent p15 gene, was
involved in 6 deletions, and 1 tumor had an intragenic deletion of p16.
All other deletions involved both p16 and p15 (CDKN2B). Williamson et
al. (1995) concluded that p16 represents the major target for deletion
at 9p21 in bladder cancer. Cairns et al. (1995) likewise found that
homozygous deletions represent the predominant mechanism of inactivation
of 9p21 in bladder tumors and are present in other tumor types,
including breast and prostate cancer. Moreover, fine mapping of these
deletions implicated a 170-kb minimal region that includes p16 and
excludes p15. Of 285 bladder cancers studied, 177 (62%) had loss of 9p
material; of these, they found LOH in 51 and homozygous deletion in 126.

Tsutsumi et al. (1998) studied p16/p19 deletion and p16 promoter
methylation, as well as loss of 9p21 heterozygosity, in pure squamous
cell carcinomas (SCC) and in transitional cell carcinomas (TCC) with SCC
of the bladder. Homozygous deletion of p16/p19 was detected in 11 of 21
(52%) cases of pure SCC and in 3 of 10 (30%) cases of TCC with SCC.
Three cases of TCC with SCC had p16/p19 deletion, hypermethylation of
the p16 promoter, or loss of heterozygosity on 9p21 only in the SCC
components, suggesting that these molecular alterations occurred
preferentially in SCC. Interestingly, homozygous deletion of p16/p19 was
observed in squamous metaplasia from 5 of 11 (45%) bladder cancer
patients, showing that this change occurred in preneoplastic cells. On
the other hand, these deletions were not found in squamous metaplasias
from noncancerous patients. Tsutsumi et al. (1998) concluded that
p16/p19 deletion is associated with early carcinogenesis of SCC of the
bladder, and squamous metaplasia of the bladder cancer patient has
already sustained genetic changes found in cancer, and that genetic
mosaicism occurs in cases of TCC with SCC, with the SCC component
showing more frequent 9p21 alterations than the TCC component.

- Role in Cutaneous Melanoma

Kamb et al. (1994) found mutations or homozygous deletions in
approximately 75% of melanoma cell lines. Studying 18 familial melanoma
kindreds, Hussussian et al. (1994) identified 6 probable disease-related
mutations in the CDKN2A gene. Among families with sufficient linkage
data, the disease-related CDKN2A germline mutations were detected in
families linked to 9p21 and not in families linked to 1p36 (155600),
thus providing support for genetic heterogeneity for this disease.
Hussussian et al. (1994) admitted that the data did not provide
definitive proof that CDKN2A mutation or deletion is required for the
development of melanoma. Functional studies of the mutated p16 protein
and gene transfer experiments to determine the ability of wildtype and
mutant CDKN2A to suppress tumorigenicity in melanoma cells with
homozygous deletions of 9p21 were considered necessary to provide that
proof.

Ranade et al. (1995) described biochemical analyses of the missense
germline mutations and a single somatic mutation detected in the
melanoma families by Hussussian et al. (1994). The melanoma-related
mutants were impaired in their ability to inhibit the catalytic activity
of the cyclin D1/CDK4 (123829) and cyclin D1/CDK6 (603368) complexes in
vitro. The data of Ranade et al. (1995) were thought to provide a
biochemical rationale for the hypothesis that carriers of certain CDKN2
mutations are at increased risk of developing melanoma.

Kamb et al. (1994) concluded that either the majority of mutations in
the CDKN2A gene causing malignant melanoma fall outside the CDKN2A
coding sequence or that CDKN2A is not the chromosome 9p melanoma
susceptibility locus that they symbolized MLM. They screened the gene
(referred to as CDKN2) for mutations in 8 American and 5 Dutch families
in which linkage studies appeared to indicate mapping of a
susceptibility locus to 9p21. Sequence analysis of the 3 coding exons
and the adjacent splice junctions revealed only 3 heterozygous
nucleotide substitutions among the 8 American probands and none in the
Dutch probands. A population frequency analysis was then conducted in
unrelated individuals who had married into high risk cancer kindreds in
Utah. Two of the variants were not detected in a set of 100 normal
samples; the third was present in 6 out of 163 samples, suggesting that
it is a polymorphism present in roughly 4% of the Utah population. By
allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO) experiments, Kamb et al. (1994)
sought the other 2 mutations in 30 affected individuals with a positive
family history for melanoma but with unknown linkage status, and in 66
affected individuals with unknown family history. No other occurrence of
the mutations was detected.

Wainwright (1994) referred to the uncertainty about the relationship of
familial melanoma and p16 as 'a hung jury.' He suggested that the
familial melanoma story 'contains a sobering, perhaps slightly
depressing lesson for those attempting to isolate genes which do not
show a fully penetrant, single locus inheritance' such as the hereditary
breast and ovarian cancer locus at chromosome 17q21 (113705).

Puig et al. (1995) analyzed 12 microsatellite markers on 9p in 54 CMM
tumors and paired normal tissues from the same subjects. In 46% of the
tumors, including 2 in situ CMMs, LOH was found at 9p. Only one tumor
was homozygously deleted for 9p markers. The smallest deleted region was
defined by 5 tumors and included markers D9S126 to D9S259. Loss of 8 or
more markers correlated significantly with a worse prognosis (P less
than 0.002). Among the primary tumors, 87.5% of those with large
deletions had a high risk of metastasis, as compared with only 18% of
those without deletions or with loss of fewer than 8 markers (P = less
than 0.001). It was not possible for Puig et al. (1995) to demonstrate
homozygous deletions of p16 in any of the CMM tumors. In 4 tumors, the
LOH for 9p markers did not involve p16. Thus, the data suggested the
existence of several tumor suppressor genes on 9p that are involved in
the predisposition to and/or progression of CMM and exclude p16 from
involvement in the early development of some melanoma tumors.

Liu et al. (1995) described a family with inherited melanoma in which a
novel mutation in exon 2 of the p16(INK4A) gene (600160.0004) segregated
with disease. The mutant allele encoded a protein with an in-frame
deletion of 2 amino acids (asp96 and leu97). They showed that the mutant
protein is functionally abnormal: it was unable to bind CDK4 in vitro
and did not inhibit colony formation in tertiary passage rat embryo
fibroblasts. Moreover, in a metastatic lesion from 1 patient, the
wildtype allele was deleted and the mutant allele retained. Liu et al.
(1995) concluded that family members carrying the germline mutation in
this gene are predisposed to melanoma.

Walker et al. (1995) found that in 7 of 18 Australian melanoma kindreds,
including the 6 largest, CDKN2 mutations segregated with the putative
melanoma chromosome previously assigned by 9p haplotype analysis. The
mutations included duplication of a 24-bp repeat, a deleted C residue
resulting in the introduction of a premature stop codon, and 4 single
basepair changes causing amino acid substitutions. Mutations segregated
to 46 of 51 affected persons in these 7 kindreds, with 3 apparent
sporadic cases in 1 family and 1 in each of another 2 families.
Penetrance was variable (55-100%) among the different mutations. These
data were presented as additional strong support that the CDKN2 gene is
the chromosome 9p21 familial melanoma locus.

FitzGerald et al. (1996) screened for germline mutations in p16 and in 2
other candidate melanoma genes, p19ARF and CDK4 (123829), in 33
consecutive patients treated for melanoma; these patients had at least 1
affected first- or second-degree relative (28 independent families).
Five independent, definitive p16 mutations were detected, including 1
nonsense, 1 disease-associated missense, and 3 small deletions. No
mutations were detected in CDK4. Disease-associated mutations in p19ARF,
whose transcript is derived in part from an alternative codon reading
frame from p16, were detected in patients who also had mutations
inactivating p16.

Dracopoli and Fountain (1996) reviewed the role of CDKN2 mutations in
cutaneous melanoma. They reported that there had been 7 independent
studies in which the CDKN2 gene was screened for germline mutations.
Germline mutations were found in 34 of 76 families. They emphasized that
CDKN2 mutations are only found in a subset of the 9p21-linked families
and postulated that failure to detect CDKN2 mutations in these
9p21-linked families may be due to problems of mutation detection by
SSCP analysis in a GC-rich region, failure to detect promoter mutations,
or genomic imprinting of CDKN2. Dracopoli and Fountain (1996) reviewed
the evidence for a second melanoma predisposing gene on 9p21 and for the
possible role in melanoma pathogenesis of the CDKN2B gene (600431),
which maps in close proximity to the CDKN2 gene. They noted that 14
different germline mutations of CDKN2 have been reported; these include
7 missense mutations, 1 nonsense mutation, 1 insertion, 4 deletions, and
a splice donor mutation. Dracopoli and Fountain (1996) stated that the
functional significance of the 7 missense mutations was hard to predict.
Using in vitro assays, they identified 3 mutants with greatly reduced
binding capacity for CDK4/cyclin D1 complexes and reduced inhibition of
RB phosphorylation. Based on comparative analysis of sporadic melanomas
and melanoma cell lines, Dracopoli and Fountain (1996) determined that
small homozygous deletions limited to a region surrounding the CDKN2
gene are approximately 5 to 6 times more common in melanoma cell lines
than in uncultured metastatic melanomas. They concluded that the growth
potential in culture of a melanoma cell without functional CDKN2 protein
is significantly higher than that of a melanoma cell with wildtype
CDKN2, and that mutation analysis based solely on analysis of tumor cell
lines should be viewed with caution.

In 27 UK families showing evidence of predisposition to melanoma,
Harland et al. (1997) sequenced all exons of CDKN2 and analyzed the CDK4
gene, which encodes the protein to which p16 binds, for mutations. Five
different germline mutations in CDKN2 were found in 6 families (e.g.,
600160.0007); 3 of them had previously been reported.

Monzon et al. (1998) used PCR, SSCP analysis, and direct DNA sequencing
to identify germline mutations in the CDKN2A gene in patients with
multiple primary melanomas who did not have family histories of the
disease. A quantitative yeast 2-hybrid assay was used to evaluate the
functional importance of the variants found. Of 33 patients with
multiple primary melanomas, 5 (15%) had germline mutations. These
included a 24-bp insertion at the 5-prime end of the coding sequence, 3
missense mutations, and a 2-bp deletion at nucleotide position 307-308,
resulting in a truncated CDKN2A protein. In 3 families, CDKN2A mutations
identical to those in the probands were found in other family members.
In 2 families with mutations, previously unknown family histories of
melanoma were uncovered.

Fargnoli et al. (1998) screened 10 familial melanoma kindreds for
germline mutations in the p16(INK4a) and p19(ARF) genes, alternatively
spliced forms of the CDKN2A gene. They identified 4 independent germline
mutations in exon 1-alpha and exon 2 of the CDKN2A gene. No
disease-associated mutations in exon 1-beta of the p19(ARF) gene were
found. From this small study, it appeared that the p19(ARF) gene does
not play a role in melanoma susceptibility.

As noted earlier, Dracopoli and Fountain (1996) reviewed the evidence
for a second melanoma predisposing gene on 9p21. Puig et al. (1995)
found large 9p deletions in 25 of 54 primary and metastatic melanomas.
Surprisingly, 4 of those 25 deletions did not include p16 itself, but
were located more proximally. Furthermore, Wiest et al. (1997) observed
100% loss of heterozygosity in the 9p region in squamous cell carcinomas
of the lung. About half of these tumors were shown to be homozygous for
a microdeletion within the area of loss of heterozygosity. Those
microdeletions clustered approximately equally in 2 areas, one of which
included p16, whereas the other more proximal cluster could have
revealed the location of another tumor suppressor gene. Studying Dutch
families with familial atypical multiple mole-melanoma syndrome (FAMMM;
155600) with the founder mutation, a 19-bp deletion in exon 2 of the
CDKN2A gene, so-called p16-Leiden (600160.0003), van der Velden et al.
(1999) found a characteristic haplotype in those carriers of p16-Leiden
with melanoma, as opposed to those p16-Leiden persons without melanoma.
They interpreted this as indicating the location of a locus linked to
p16 which modifies melanoma risk in these families.

Solar ultraviolet radiation is the major environmental risk factor for
nevi. However, Zhu et al. (1999) performed a twin study to investigate
large differences among individuals living in a small geographic area
with uniformly high skin exposure. Nevi may be subclassified as raised
or flat. In the sample of Zhu et al. (1999), raised nevi were 27% of the
total, and the 2 kinds had a correlation of 0.33. Correlations for total
nevus count in 153 monozygotic and 199 dizygotic twin pairs were 0.94
and 0.60, respectively, a finding compatible with a very high degree of
genetic determination. The authors hypothesized that some of the genetic
variance might be due to variation in the CDKN2A gene. Analysis of
linkage to a highly polymorphic marker (D9S942), located close to
CDKN2A, detected quantitative trait loci (QTL) effects accounting for
27% of variance in total nevus count, rising to 33% if flat but not
raised moles were considered. Total heritability was higher for raised
(0.69) than for flat (0.42) moles, but QTL linkage was zero for raised
moles, whereas it accounted for 80% of the heritability of flat moles;
additionally, family environment accounted for only 15% of variance in
raised moles versus 46% in flat moles. These findings suggested that
raised and flat nevi have different etiologies. Longer alleles at D9S942
were associated with higher flat mole counts. Since germline mutations
in CDKN2A are rare, it was considered likely that variants in the
noncoding regions of this gene, or in another gene nearby, are
responsible for this major determinant of moles and, hence, of melanoma
risk.

In a genomewide study of nevus count using an expanded sample of twins
and their families, including 221 pairs of monozygotic twins, Zhu et al.
(2007) confirmed linkage to chromosome 9p21 with a maximum lod score of
3.42 after inclusion of fine mapping markers.

Bahuau et al. (1998) identified a germline deletion involving the CDKN2A
locus in familial proneness to melanoma and nervous system tumors.
Petronzelli et al. (2001) detected a novel splice site mutation in a
family with melanomas, neurofibromas, and multiple dysplastic nevi. Both
alternative mRNAs produced by the mutant allele lacked shared sequences
from exon 2, which encodes a substantial portion (more than 50%) of both
p16(INK4) and p14(ARF) proteins. They suggested that the development of
neurofibromas may be explained by cooperative effects of combined
inactivation of these 2 proteins or, alternatively, of p14(ARF) alone.

The melanoma-astrocytoma syndrome (155755) is characterized by a dual
predisposition to melanoma and neural system tumors, commonly
astrocytoma. Germline deletions of the region on 9p21 containing the
CDKN2A and CDKN2B genes and CDKN2A exon 1-beta have been reported in
kindreds, implicating contiguous tumor suppressor gene deletion as a
cause of this syndrome. Randerson-Moor et al. (2001) described a family
characterized by multiple melanoma and neural cell tumors segregating
with a germline deletion of the p14(ARF)-specific exon 1-beta of CDKN2A.
The deletion did not affect the coding or minimal promoter sequences of
either CDKN2A or CDKN2B. The authors hypothesized that the phenotype is
due to either loss of p14(ARF) function, rather than contiguous loss of
both CDKN2A and CDKN2B; or disruption of expression of p16.

Mutations in the CDKN2A gene are melanoma-predisposition alleles with
high penetrance, although they have low population frequencies. In
contrast, variants of the melanocortin-1 receptor gene (MC1R; 155555)
confer much lower melanoma risk but are common in European populations.
To test for possible modifier effects on melanoma risk, Box et al.
(2001) assessed 15 Australian CDKN2A mutation-carrying melanoma
pedigrees for MC1R genotype. A CDKN2A mutation in the presence of a
homozygous consensus MC1R genotype had a raw penetrance of 50%, with a
mean age at onset of 58.1 years. When an MC1R variant allele was also
present, the raw penetrance of the CDKN2A mutation increased to 84%,
with a mean age at onset of 37.8 years (P = 0.01). The presence of a
CDKN2A mutation gave a hazard ratio of 13.35, and a hazard ratio of 3.72
for MC1R variant alleles was also significant. The impact of MC1R
variants on risk of melanoma was mediated largely through the action of
3 common alleles, arg151 to cys (R151C; 155555.0004), arg160 to trp
(155555.0005), and asp294 to his (155555.0001), known to be associated
with red hair, fair skin, and skin sensitivity to ultraviolet light.

Van der Velden et al. (2001) found that the MC1R variant R151C modified
melanoma risk in Dutch families with melanoma. They concluded that the
R151C variant is overrepresented in patients with melanoma from families
with the p16-Leiden mutation (600160.0003). They suggested that the
R151C variant may be involved in melanoma tumorigenesis in a dual
manner, both as a determinant of fair skin and as a component in an
independent additional pathway, because the variant contributed to
increased melanoma risk even after statistical correction for its effect
on skin type.

In an analysis of 15 Italian melanoma families for germline mutations,
Della Torre et al. (2001) gained results supporting the view that
inactivating mutations of CDKN2A contribute to melanoma susceptibility
more than activating mutations of CDK4 and that other genetic factors
must be responsible for melanoma clustering in a high proportion of
families.

In North America, Europe, and Australasia, approximately 20% of familial
melanoma kindreds carry germline mutations in CDKN2A. There is also an
increased risk of pancreatic cancer in a subset of families with
mutation in this gene. Using published data, Goldstein (2004) found that
67 different CDKN2A mutations had been identified in 189 melanoma-prone
families. In 42 families with 18 different mutations, pancreatic cancer
had also been reported. Seventy percent of the mutations were observed
only once. Comparison of 147 melanoma-prone families without pancreatic
cancer to the 42 families that had pancreatic cancer reported showed no
significant differences in the types or locations of mutations.

Kannengiesser et al. (2009) identified 20 novel germline mutations in
the CDKN2A gene in patients with familial melanoma or multiple
melanomas. Segregation studies, in silico analysis, in vitro functional
studies showing loss of interaction with CDK4, and cell proliferation
assays indicated that 18 of the 20 variants had clear loss of function,
allowing them to be classified as pathogenic. All of the mutations
affected the p16(INK4) structure.

- Association with Diabetes

In genomewide association studies of type 2 diabetes (125853) involving
genotype data from a variety of international consortia, the Diabetes
Genetics Initiative of Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Lund
University, and Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (2007),
Zeggini et al. (2007), and Scott et al. (2007) detected association of a
single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on chromosome 9, dbSNP rs10811661,
and diabetes susceptibility. This SNP is 125 kb upstream from
CDKN2A/CDKN2B, the nearest annotated genes. All-data metaanalyses
obtained genomewide significance (OR = 1.20, P = 7.8 x 10(-15)).

Helgadottir et al. (2008) replicated the association of the dbSNP
rs10811661 T allele to type 2 diabetes in Icelandic, Danish, and United
States case-control groups (OR = 1.29, P = 2.5 x 10(-10)).

- Role in Other Cancers

Although pituitary tumors develop at a high frequency in retinoblastoma
(Rb)-knockout mice, defects in the RB gene are not common in human
pituitary tumors. The inverse correlation of RB and p16 defects in
certain human tumors led Woloschak et al. (1996) to investigate the
expression of p16 in human pituitary tumors as an indirect mechanism of
RB inactivation. By Western blot analysis, the p16 gene product was
undetectable in 25 human pituitary tumors, whereas high levels of p16
could be demonstrated in 10 normal human pituitary specimens under the
same conditions of protein extraction and immunoblotting. Similar
results were obtained at the mRNA level. Quantitative PCR analysis
revealed diminished amplification of p16 relative to a control gene in 3
of 25 tumors, suggesting homozygous p16 gene loss. This altered
expression is not associated with frequent p16 mutation or gene loss,
suggesting to Woloschak et al. (1996) that alternative mechanisms of
gene inactivation and/or altered regulation occur in most of these
tumors.

Ohhara et al. (1996) examined the sequence and expression level of the
CDKN2A gene in primary colorectal carcinomas. Using RT-PCR, they
quantitatively detected the CDKN2A transcript in 14 of 17 tumors, but in
only one case of adjacent normal mucosa. Direct sequencing of the
amplified CDKN2A gene showed no somatic mutations in the 17 tumors
examined. The authors concluded that enhanced expression, rather than
inactivation of the CDKN2A gene, may be involved in the early stages of
the pathogenesis of primary colorectal carcinomas.

Pilon et al. (1999) investigated inactivation of the p16 tumor
suppressor gene in a series of 14 adrenocortical tumors. Using 11
polymorphic microsatellite markers spanning the short arm of chromosome
9, they demonstrated that 3 of 7 adrenocortical carcinomas and 1 of 7
adrenocortical adenomas had LOH within chromosome 9p21, the region
containing p16. Immunohistochemistry showed the absence of p16 nuclear
staining in all adrenocortical tumors with LOH within 9p21, and positive
staining in all remaining tumors without LOH. The authors concluded that
LOH within 9p21 associated with lack of p16 expression occurs in a
considerable proportion of adrenocortical malignant tumors but is rare
in adenomas. Furthermore, they suggested that inactivation of p16 may
contribute to the deregulation of cell proliferation in this neoplastic
disease.

Honoki et al. (2007) performed a metaanalysis of 6 studies representing
188 patients with Ewing sarcoma (612219). Presence of a p16(INK4a)
mutation was associated with a poor prognosis, as assessed by likelihood
of 2-year survival. The estimated pooled relative risk for p16(INK4a)
alteration for 2-year survival was statistically significant (2.17; 95%
confidence interval 1.55-3.03). There was no statistically significant
difference in the pooled estimated risk ratios of p16(INK4a) alteration
for disease outcome between patients with or without metastasis at
diagnosis.

In a study of patients with stage I nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC;
see 211980) who underwent curative resection but had a recurrence
compared to matched patients who did not have a recurrence, Brock et al.
(2008) found that promoter methylation of the CDKN2A, CDH13 (601364),
RASSF1A (605082), and APC (611731) genes in tumors and in histologically
tumor-negative lymph nodes was independently associated with tumor
recurrence. Methylation of the promoter regions of CDKN2A and CDH13 in
both tumor and mediastinal lymph nodes was associated with an odds ratio
of recurrent cancer of 15.50 in the original cohort and an OR of 25.25
when the original cohort was combined with an independent validation
cohort of 20 patients with stage I NSCLC.

For a discussion of a possible association between variation in the
CDKN2A gene and glioma, see GLM5 (613030).

- Mutation Databases

Smith-Sorensen and Hovig (1996) reported a database with 146 point
mutations in the CDKN2A gene. They also summarized studies of the
biochemical and biologic functions of both wildtype and mutant proteins.

Murphy et al. (2004) described an online database describing both
germline and somatic variants of the CDKN2A tumor suppressor gene.

NOMENCLATURE

Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor-2A (CDKN2A) goes by the colloquial
designation p16, and is sometimes (e.g., Wainwright, 1994; Ranade et
al., 1995) referred to as p16(INK4). The gene was originally symbolized
MTS1 (for multiple tumor suppressor-1) by Kamb et al. (1994), who later
used the symbol CDKN2 because MTS1 had been preempted by the malignant
transformation suppression-1 gene (154280) located on 1p. See also
CDKN2B (600431).

ANIMAL MODEL

Krimpenfort et al. (2001) mutated mice specifically in the
Cdkn2a(p16-Ink4a) isoform, generating an allele called Ink4a. This
allele is silent in the p16(Arf) reading frame but introduces a stop
codon in the p16(Ink4a) transcript at conserved amino acid position 101,
resulting in deletion of the fourth ankyrin repeat motif. The analogous
human allele is a naturally occurring mutation found in a wide variety
of human tumor types and results in an unstable protein that is severely
defective in its ability to inhibit phosphorylation of RB1 and to induce
cell cycle arrest in transfected cells. Ink4a-homozygous mice do not
show a significant predisposition to spontaneous tumor formation within
17 months. Embryo fibroblasts derived from them proliferate normally,
are mortal, and are not transformed by oncogenic HRAS (190020). The very
mild phenotype of the Ink4a-homozygous mice implies that the very strong
phenotypes of the original Ink4a/Arf(delta-2,3) mice was primarily or
solely due to loss of Arf. However, mice that are deficient for Ink4a
and heterozygous for Arf spontaneously developed a wide spectrum of
tumors, including melanoma. Treatment of these mice with the carcinogen
7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA) results in an increased incidence of
melanoma, with frequent metastases. Krimpenfort et al. (2001) concluded
that in the mouse, Ink4a is a tumor-suppressor gene that, when lost, can
recapitulate the tumor predisposition seen in humans. Sharpless et al.
(2001) generated p16(Ink4a)-specific knockout mice that retained normal
p19(Arf) function. Mice lacking p16(Ink4a) were born with expected
mendelian distribution and exhibited normal development except for
thymic hyperplasia. T cells deficient in p16(Ink4a) exhibited enhanced
mitogenic responsiveness, consistent with the established role of
p16(Ink4a) in constraining cellular proliferation. In contrast to mouse
embryo fibroblasts deficient in p19(Arf), p16(Ink4a)-null mouse embryo
fibroblasts possessed normal growth characteristics and remained
susceptible to RAS-induced senescence. Compared with wildtype mouse
embryo fibroblasts, p16(Ink4a)-null mouse embryo fibroblasts exhibited
an increased rate of immortalization, although this rate was less than
that observed previously for cells null for Ink4a/Arf, p19(Arf), or p53
(191170). Furthermore, p16(Ink4a) deficiency alone was associated with
an increased incidence in spontaneous and carcinogen-induced cancers.
Sharpless et al. (2001) concluded that p16(Ink4a) along with p19(Arf),
functions as a tumor suppressor in mice.

INK4A/ARF and p53 mutations promote tumorigenesis and drug resistance in
part by disabling apoptosis. Schmitt et al. (2002) showed that primary
murine lymphomas responded to chemotherapy by engaging a senescence
program controlled by p53 and p16(Ink4a). Hence, tumors with p53 or
Ink4a/Arf mutations, but not those lacking Arf alone, responded poorly
to cyclophosphamide therapy in vivo. Moreover, tumors harboring a Bcl2
(151430)-mediated apoptotic block underwent a drug-induced cytostasis
involving the accumulation of p53, p16(Ink4a), and senescence markers,
and typically acquired p53 or Ink4a mutations upon progression to a
terminal stage. Mice bearing tumors capable of drug-induced senescence
had a much better prognosis following chemotherapy than those harboring
tumors with senescence defects. Therefore, cellular senescence
contributes to treatment outcome in vivo.

Sugimoto et al. (2003) showed that p19(ARF) inhibits production of
ribosomal RNA, retarding processing of 47/45S and 32S precursors. These
effects correlated with but did not strictly depend upon inhibition of
rRNA biosynthesis or cell cycle arrest, were not mimicked by p53, and
required neither p53 nor MDM2. ARF mutants lacking conserved amino acid
residues 2 to 14 did not block rRNA synthesis and processing or inhibit
cell proliferation. The authors proposed that evolution may have linked
a primordial nucleolar ARF function to MDM2 and p53, creating a more
efficient checkpoint-signaling pathway for coordinating ribosomal
biogenesis and cell cycle progression.

The TRP53 and RB pathways are 2 of the principal pathways controlling
cell proliferation that have been identified in human and mouse cells.
The CDKN2A locus is involved in both pathways by virtue of encoding
p16(INK4a), a regulator of RB1 phosphorylation mediated by CDK4 and CDK6
(603368), and p19(ARF), a modulator of p53 degradation mediated by MDM2.
Mice deficient for both p16(INK4a) and p19(ARF) are viable but highly
prone to tumors, succumbing to lymphomas and fibrosarcomas early in life
(Serrano et al., 1996). Lund et al. (2002) used large-scale insertional
mutagenesis to screen for loci that can participate in tumorigenesis in
collaboration with loss of the Cdkn2a gene in Cdkn2a -/- mice. They
infected such mice with Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMuLV).
Insertional mutagenesis by the latent retrovirus was synergistic with
loss of Cdkn2a expression, as indicated by a marked acceleration in the
development of both myeloid and lymphoid tumors. Lund et al. (2002)
isolated 747 unique sequences flanking retroviral integration sites and
mapped them against the mouse genome sequence databases from Celera and
Ensembl. In addition to 17 insertions targeting gene loci known to be
cancer related, the authors identified 37 new common insertion sites, 8
of which encode components of signaling pathways that are involved in
cancer.

Tsai et al. (2002) demonstrated that loss of the Arf tumor suppressor
gene strongly accelerates intermediate lobe pituitary tumorigenesis in
Rb heterozygous mice. The effects in the pituitary were greater than
those conferred by loss of p53. Tsai et al. (2002) concluded that
inactivation of ARF acts more broadly than that of p53 in connecting
abrogation of the RB pathway to tumorigenesis.

Aslanian et al. (2004) found that in wildtype mouse embryonic
fibroblasts (MEFs), the Arf promoter was occupied by E2f3 but not by any
other E2f family members. In quiescent cells, this role was largely
fulfilled by the E2f3b isoform. E2f3 loss was sufficient to derepress
Arf, triggering activation of p53 (191170) and expression of p21(Cip1).
Thus, E2f3 is a key repressor of the p19(Arf)-p53 pathway in normal
cells. Consistent with this, Arf mutation suppressed the activation of
p53 and p21(Cip1) in E2f3-deficient MEFs. Arf loss also rescued the cell
cycle reentry defect of E2f3-null cells, which correlated with
restoration of appropriate activation of classic E2f-responsive genes.

In rodent models of aging, Krishnamurthy et al. (2004) found that
expression of p16(Ink4a) and Arf markedly increased in almost all
tissues with advancing age, whereas there was little or no change in the
expression of other related cell cycle inhibitors. The age-associated
increase in expression of p16(Ink4a) and Arf was attenuated in the
kidney, ovary, and heart by caloric restriction, and this decrease
correlated with diminished expression of an in vivo marker of senescence
as well as decreased pathology of those organs. Krishnamurthy et al.
(2004) suggested that expression of the INK4A/ARF tumor suppressor locus
is a robust biomarker, and possible effector, of mammalian aging.

To investigate the role of oncogenic signaling in p53-mediated
protection against cancer, Efeyan et al. (2006) used mice with 2
genetically engineered traits: one had no Arf allele, and the other had
a 'super' p53 allele, i.e., they carried a single additional transgenic
copy of the intact p53 gene. Efeyan et al. (2006) found that Arf-null
mice responded normally to DNA damage and that p53(super) mice showed
the same enhancement of apoptosis irrespective of whether ARF was
present or absent. However, Arf-null cells were unable to respond
effectively to oncogenic signaling and underwent neoplastic
transformation by oncogenes in vitro, irrespective of the presence or
absence of the p53(super) allele. Efeyan et al. (2006) found that
p53(super)/Arf-null mice succumbed to spontaneous tumors at the same
rate as wildtype p53/Arf-null mice, producing the same profile of
sarcomas, lymphomas, and histiocytic sarcomas. When they treated both
classes of mice with a DNA-damaging agent, the p53(super) mice with the
Arf-null allele did not benefit from the extra p53 allele. Efeyan et al.
(2006) concluded that oncogenic signaling is the critical event that
elicits p53-dependent protection, and that DNA damage stimulus is less
important.

Using the model developed by Christophorou et al. (2005) in which p53
status can be reversibly switched in vivo between functional and
inactive states, Christophorou et al. (2006) found that the p53-mediated
pathologic response to whole body irradiation, a prototypic genotoxic
carcinogen, is irrelevant for suppression of radiation-induced lymphoma.
In contrast, delaying the restoration of p53 function until the acute
radiation response subsided abrogated all of the radiation-induced
pathology yet preserved much of the protection from lymphoma.
Christophorou et al. (2006) found that such protection is absolutely
dependent on p19(ARF), a tumor suppressor induced not by DNA damage, but
by oncogenic disruption of the cell cycle.

Matheu et al. (2007) showed that genetically manipulated mice with
increased but otherwise normally regulated levels of Arf and p53
presented strong cancer resistance and had decreased levels of
aging-associated damage. Matheu et al. (2007) concluded that their
observations extended the protective role of Arf/p53 to aging, revealing
a previously unknown anti-aging mechanism and providing a rationale for
the coevolution of cancer resistance and longevity.

Because mice lacking the Arf tumor-suppressor gene develop eye disease
reminiscent of persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV; see
611308), Thornton et al. (2007) explored mechanisms by which Arf
promoted eye development and its absence caused a PHPV-like disease.
Chimeric mice were made by fusing wildtype and Arf -/- morulae. Newborn
chimeras had primary vitreous hyperplasia, evident as a retrolental
mass. The mass was usually present when the proportion of Arf -/- was
relatively high and absent when the Arf -/- proportion was low. Thornton
et al. (2007) concluded that in the mouse model, loss of Arf in only a
subset of cells caused a PHPV-like disease. The data indicated that both
cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous effects of Arf might contribute
to its role in vitreous development.

Krimpenfort et al. (2007) reported that mice deficient for all 3 open
reading frames encoded at the Cdkn2 locus (Cdkn2ab-null) are more
tumor-prone and develop a wider spectrum of tumors than Cdkn2a mutant
mice, with a preponderance of skin tumors and soft tissue sarcomas
(i.e., mesothelioma) frequently composed of mixed cell types and often
showing biphasic differentiation. Cdkn2ab-null mouse embryonic
fibroblasts were substantially more sensitive to oncogenic
transformation than Cdkn2a mutant mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs).
Under conditions of stress, p15(Ink4b) (600431) protein levels were
significantly elevated in MEFs deficient for p16(Ink4a). Krimpenfort et
al. (2007) concluded that p15(Ink4b) can fulfill a critical backup
function for p16(Ink4a) and suggested a model that provided an
explanation for the frequent loss of the complete CDKN2B-CDKN2A locus in
human tumors.

Bmi1 (164831) is necessary for the maintenance of adult hematopoietic
stem cells (HSCs) and neural stem cells. Akala et al. (2008)
demonstrated that bone marrow cells from mice with triple deletion of
p16(Ink4a), p19(Arf), and Trp53, all genetically downstream of Bmi1,
have an approximately 10-fold increase in cells able to reconstitute the
blood long term. This increase was associated with the acquisition of
long-term reconstitution capacity by cells of the phenotype
c-kit+Sca1+Flt3+CD150-CD48-Lin-, which defines multipotent progenitors
in wildtype mice. The pattern of triple mutant multipotent progenitor
response to growth factors resembled that of wildtype multipotent
progenitors but not wildtype HSCs. Akala et al. (2008) concluded that
p16(Ink4a)/p19(Arf) and Trp53 have a central role in limiting the
expansion potential of multipotent progenitors. The authors commented
that these pathways are commonly repressed in cancer, suggesting a
mechanism by which early progenitor cells could gain the ability to
self-renew and become malignant with further oncogenic mutations.

Visel et al. (2010) showed that deletion of the 70-kb noncoding interval
on mouse chromosome 4 orthologous to the chromosome 9p21 interval
associated with human coronary artery disease (CAD) (see CHD8, 611139)
affects cardiac expression of neighboring genes, as well as
proliferation properties of vascular cells. Mice with homozygous
deletion of the 70-kb interval (delta-70-kb) were viable but showed
increased mortality both during development and as adults. Cardiac
expression of 2 genes near the noncoding interval, Cdkn2a and Cdkn2b
(600431), was severely reduced in delta-70-kb homozygous mice,
indicating that distant-acting gene regulatory functions are located in
the noncoding CAD risk interval. Allele-specific expression of Cdkn2b
transcripts in heterozygous mice showed that the deletion affects
expression through a cis-acting mechanism. Primary cultures of aortic
smooth muscle cells from homozygous delta-70-kb mice exhibited excessive
proliferation and diminished senescence, a cellular phenotype consistent
with accelerated CAD pathogenesis. Visel et al. (2010) concluded that,
taken together, their results provided direct evidence that the CAD risk
interval has a pivotal role in the regulation of cardiac CDKN2A/B
expression, and suggested that this region affects coronary artery
disease progression by altering the dynamics of vascular cell
proliferation.

Huang et al. (2011) demonstrated the direct induction of functional
hepatocyte-like (induced hepatocyte, iHep) cells from mouse tail-tip
fibroblasts by transduction of Gata4 (600576), Hnf1-alpha (142410), and
Foxa3 (602295) and inactivation of p19(Arf). iHep cells showed typical
epithelial morphology, expressed hepatic genes, and acquired hepatocyte
functions. Notably, transplanted iHep cells repopulated the livers of
fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase-deficient (Fah-null; see 613871) mice and
rescued almost half of recipients from death by restoring liver
functions.

Among the melanoma (155601) cell lines that carried at least 1 copy of
CDKN2A (the other copy frequently being deleted), Kamb et al. (1994)

nonsense, missense, or frameshift mutations were identified, Kamb et al.
(1994) found the same mutation in 2: a C-to-T transition converting
codon 232 from arg to stop.

CDKN2A, 19-BP DEL, NT225

Gruis et al. (1995) analyzed CDKN2A coding sequences in 15 Dutch FAMMM
syndrome pedigrees, and identified a 19-bp germline deletion in 13 of
them. All 13 families originated from an endogamous population. The
deletion caused a reading-frame shift, predicted to result in a severely
truncated p16 protein. Homozygosity for the deletion was found in 2
family members, one of whom showed no obvious signs of melanoma. The
finding demonstrated that homozygotes for this CDKN2A mutation are
viable, and suggested the presence of a genetic mechanism that can
compensate for the functional loss of p16. The results strengthened the
notion that p16 is the molecular nature of the 9p21-linked form of
familial melanoma (CMM2; 155601). Of the 2 homozygous individuals, one
was fully examined at the age of 54 and showed as the only possible sign
of FAMMM 3 very mildly atypical nevi. Until her death from
adenocarcinoma (site not stated) at the age of 55, this subject remained
free of melanomas. The second homozygote, a nephew of the first, had a
very large number of atypical moles at the age of 11; at the age of 15,
an invasive melanoma was found.

(In addition to the 19-bp deletion of p16, which goes by the name of
Leiden, there is at least one familial hypercholesterolemia Leiden
(143890.0041), factor V Leiden (612309.0001), apoE3 Leiden
(107741.0006), and a hemoglobin Leiden (141900.0156).)

Van der Velden et al. (1999) hypothesized that a tentative second
tumor-related gene in 9p21 may also act as a modifier of melanoma risk
conveyed by known CDKN2A mutations. To identify genetic modifiers for a
known, 'primary' susceptibility gene, one would ideally need to study a
large number of carriers of a single mutation in that primary gene.
Dutch FAMMM families provided them with a unique opportunity for such
studies, since the 19-bp founder deletion in exon 2 of the CDKN2A gene,
p16-Leiden, segregated in most Dutch FAMMM families. The 36% cumulative
incidence for melanoma in p16-Leiden carriers illustrated a high
melanoma risk associated with this mutation but also suggested that
environmental and/or genetic factors act as risk modifiers. Van der
Velden et al. (1999) performed haplotype analysis for 9p21 using
microsatellite markers in 6 p16-Leiden families originating from a
founder population. In 2 families, p16-Leiden carriers shared an
unexpectedly large founder haplotype (approximately 20 cM) around
CDKN2A, mostly in the proximal direction. Melanoma-positive p16-Leiden
carriers from these families showed this extensive proximal haplotype,
compared with melanoma-negative p16-Leiden carriers from the same
families. Additional p16-Leiden families less heavily affected with
melanoma showed shorter haplotype sharing, excluding the region proximal
of CDKN2A. The presence of a gene involved in melanoma susceptibility
proximal to CDKN2A was corroborated by somatic deletions of 9p in
tumors, which frequently did not include CDKN2A but a more proximal
chromosomal region instead. The results provided a candidate region for
further gene mapping in p16-negative 9p21-linked melanoma families and
guided the search for risk modifiers in melanoma development.

Vasen et al. (2000) performed mutation analysis on 27 families with
FAMMM syndrome and identified the CDKN2A-Leiden mutation in 19 families.
They identified 86 patients with melanoma, and the second most frequent
cancer was pancreatic carcinoma, which was observed in 15 patients from
7 families. The mean age at diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma was 58
years, with a range from 38 to 77 years. Putative mutation carriers had
an estimated cumulative risk of 17% for developing pancreatic carcinoma
by age 75 years. In the 8 CDKN2A-Leiden-negative families, no cases of
pancreatic carcinoma had occurred. The authors concluded that
individuals with the CDKN2A-Leiden mutation show an enormous risk of
developing pancreatic cancer (see 606719).

Schneider-Stock et al. (2003) found the p16-Leiden mutation in
heterozygous state in the blood and all 3 tumors of a man who was
diagnosed at age 54 years with simultaneous development of 3 carcinomas
of the pharynx and oral cavity. The patient neither smoked more than 5
cigarettes daily nor abused alcohol. Both his parents and his only
sister died of cancer very early (the mother of gynecologic cancer, the
father of liver carcinoma, and the sister of leukemia).

Harinck et al. (2012) identified the Leiden mutation (225_243del) in 5
Dutch families ascertained for familial clustering of pancreatic cancer.
Four of the families with the Leiden mutation had members who developed
melanoma. In the fifth family, only pancreatic cancer segregated with
mutation status; no cases of melanoma were noted. Harinck et al. (2012)
concluded that the CDKN2A gene should be analyzed in families with
pancreatic cancer, even if melanoma is not present.

mutation is now designated GLY101TRP.)

Whelan et al. (1995) described a kindred with an increased risk of
pancreatic cancers, melanomas, and possibly additional types of tumors
(see 606719) cosegregating with the gly93-to-trp CDKN2 mutation. Of
interest was the occurrence of squamous-cell carcinomas in this family,
a rare form, and squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue in the proband.
More than half of primary esophageal squamous cell carcinomas have CDKN2
mutations (Mori et al., 1994). The mutation was identified by SSCP
analysis and was located in exon 2 where direct sequencing demonstrated
a G-to-T nucleotide change at position 295.

Ciotti et al. (1996) indicated that in a small geographic area of Italy
(possibly because of founder effect), they had detected the gly93-to-trp
mutation in 7 apparently unrelated families and in none of 50 control
persons. Nineteen cases of melanoma and 3 of dysplastic nevi were
diagnosed at ages ranging from 21 to 70 years in the kindreds with the
G93W mutation. In addition, 15 cancers at other sites were found in
these kindreds, including 3 pancreatic cancers but no gastric cancers.
The pancreatic tumors developed in members of 3 different families at
the ages of 48, 51, and 60 years.

Ciotti et al. (2000) stated that gly101-to-trp is the most common CDKN2A
missense mutation, having been reported in numerous families from around
the world, with a particularly high occurrence in France and Italy. They
examined the date of origin of the mutation and its migratory spread in
10 families from Italy, 4 families from the U.S., and 6 families from
France. In all families studied, the mutation appeared to have been
derived from a single ancestral haplotype. Using maximum likelihood
methods, they estimated that the mutation arose 97 generations ago,
providing some explanation for the wide geographic spread of this common
mutation, particularly in southwestern Europe. All of the Italian
families, with one exception, came from a small area on the eastern
coast of Liguria.

Auroy et al. (2001) found the G101W mutation in 7 patients with multiple
primary melanomas with no known melanoma cases within their families.
They stated that the mutation had already been described in more than 20
melanoma-prone families. They genotyped 8 microsatellite markers
flanking the CDKN2A gene and found, after allowing for recombination
over time, that haplotype sharing provided evidence for an original
G101W mutation common to 6 of the 7 sporadic multiple primary melanoma
cases.

In Italy, Mantelli et al. (2002) screened for CDKN2A mutations in
families with 2 melanoma patients, 1 of whom was younger than 50 years
at onset and the other complying with 1 of the following: being a
first-degree relative; having an additional relative with pancreatic
cancer; or having multiple primary melanomas. Mutations were found in 21
of the 62 families (34%) with a high prevalence of the G101W mutation
(18 of 21).

In in vitro functional studies in mammalian cells, McKenzie et al.
(2010) found that the G101W mutant protein had decreased binding to CDK4
(123829) (about 20% of wildtype). Cell cycle inhibitory activity was
similar to wildtype at 37 degrees Celsius, but was decreased at 40
degrees.

MELANOMA, CUTANEOUS MALIGNANT, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO , 2
CDKN2A, 3-BP DUP, ARG105INS

In 10 melanoma (155601) kindreds from southern Sweden, Borg et al.
(1996) identified a novel germline mutation in 2 families, constituting
an in-frame 3-bp duplication at nucleotide 332 in exon 2. The mutation
resulted in an insertion of arg at codon 105, which interrupts the last
of the 4 ankyrin repeats of the p16 protein, motifs which have been
demonstrated as important in binding and inhibiting the activity of
cyclin D-dependent kinases 4 and 6 in cell cycle G1 phase regulation.
Other malignancies observed in gene carriers or obligate carriers
included cervical, breast, and pancreatic carcinomas, and a non-Hodgkin
lymphoma. Analysis of microsatellite markers adjacent to the p16 gene at
chromosomal region 9p21 in the 2 families with the mutation showed that
they shared a common haplotype, in keeping with a common ancestor.

By haplotype analysis, Hashemi et al. (2001) concluded that the mutation
arose 98 generations, or approximately 2,000 years, ago. Thus, the
mutation, which they designated 113insR, could be expected to have a
more widespread geographic distribution in regions of Europe and North
America with ancestral connections to Sweden. Alternatively, CDKN2A may
lie in a recombination hotspot region, as suggested by the finding of
many meiotic recombinations in a narrow region of approximately 1 cM on
9p21.

.0007
MELANOMA, CUTANEOUS MALIGNANT, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 2
CDKN2A, MET53ILE

Harland et al. (1997) identified a met53-to-ile (M53I) mutation in the
CDKN2A gene in affected members of a family with melanoma (155601). They
showed that the protein expressed from this previously described
mutation did not bind to CDK4/CDK6 (see 123829), confirming its role as
a causal mutation in melanoma. Monzon et al. (1998) found the same
mutation in a patient with multiple melanomas who was thought to have no
family history of melanoma when first investigated.

Pollock et al. (1998) pointed out that the M53I mutation had been
described in 5 melanoma families from Australia and North America.
Haplotype analysis suggested that there may have been only 1 original
M53I mutation.

MacKie et al. (1998) identified this mutation in 4 U.K. melanoma
families and also in 1 patient with multiple primary melanomas and a
negative family history.

.0008
MELANOMA, CUTANEOUS MALIGNANT, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 2
CDKN2A, ARG24PRO

In a patient with multiple primary melanomas (155601), Monzon et al.
(1998) identified an arg24-to-pro mutation in the CDKN2A gene. They
pointed out that this mutation had previously been reported in
melanoma-prone families and was found to cosegregate with cases of
melanoma. MacKie et al. (1998) identified this mutation in a U.K.
melanoma family.

.0009
MELANOMA, CUTANEOUS MALIGNANT, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 2
CDKN2A, 24-BP DUP

Pollock et al. (1998) identified 2 new melanoma (155601) kindreds that
carried a duplication of a 24-bp repeat present in the 5-prime region of
the CDKN2A gene. This brought to a total of 5 the number of melanoma
families described with this mutation; the 5 families were from 3
continents: Europe, North America, and Australasia. Previous families
were reported by Goldstein et al. (1995), Walker et al. (1995), and
Flores et al. (1997). This suggested to Pollock et al. (1998) that there
had been at least 3 independent 24-bp duplication events. The
duplication was hypothesized to have arisen due to an unequal
crossing-over between the two 24-bp repeats naturally present in the
wildtype sequence, possibly through polymerase slippage during
replication. Further evidence that this repeat region is unstable and
therefore prone to both meiotic and mitotic slippage was provided by the
identification of a somatic 24-bp deletion of 1 of these normally
occurring repeats in a prostate tumor (Komiya et al., 1995).

In in vitro functional expression studies in mammalian cells, McKenzie
et al. (2010) found that the 24-bp duplication mutant had slightly
decreased affinity for CDK4 (123829) (80% compared to wildtype), but
remained fully active in mediating cell cycle arrest. In addition, the
24-bp duplication showed normal subcellular localization.

.0010
MELANOMA, CUTANEOUS MALIGNANT, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 2
CDKN2A, -34G-T

Though germline CDKN2A coding mutations cosegregated with melanoma
(155601) in 25 to 60% of families predisposed to the disease, there
remain a number of mutation-negative families that demonstrate linkage
of inherited melanoma to 9p21 markers (Hayward, 1996). Liu et al. (1999)
showed that a subset of these kindreds possesses a G-to-T transversion
at nucleotide -34 of CDKN2A, designated -34G-T. The mutation gives rise
to a novel AUG translation initiation codon that decreases translation
from the wildtype AUG. The -34G-T mutation was not seen in controls,
segregated with melanoma in families, and, on the basis of haplotyping
studies, appeared to have arisen from a common founder in the United
Kingdom. Liu et al. (1999) suggested that screening for mutations in the
promoter region of the CDKN2A gene should be useful in English (MacGeoch
et al., 1994), Australian (Holland et al., 1995), and other northern
European populations (Borg et al., 1996) in which a low incidence of
germline coding mutations of CDKN2A has been found in familial melanoma
cases.

MELANOMA AND NEURAL SYSTEM TUMOR SYNDROME
CDKN2A, EXON 1-BETA DEL

Randerson-Moor et al. (2001) described a family characterized by
multiple melanoma and neural cell tumors (155755) segregating with a
germline deletion of the p14(ARF)-specific exon 1-beta of CDKN2A. The
deletion was approximately 14 kb and did not affect the coding or
minimal promoter sequences of either CDKN2A or CDKN2B.

CDKN2A, VAL126ASP

One of the most common melanoma (155601)-related CDKN2A mutations
reported in North America is val126 to asp (V126D). Goldstein et al.
(2001) examined 9 markers surrounding the CDKN2A gene in 3 American and
4 Canadian families carrying this mutation. All 7 families had a
haplotype consistent with a common ancestor/founder. The mutation
appeared to have originated 34 to 52 generations ago; 1 lod unit
supported an interval of 13 to 98 generations.

.0014
MELANOMA, CUTANEOUS MALIGNANT, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 2
CDKN2A, IVS2, A-G, -105

Harland et al. (2001) reported that affected individuals in 6 of 90
English melanoma (155601) pedigrees screened carried a transition
(IVS2-105 A-G) deep in intron 2 of the CDKN2A gene. The mutation creates
a false GT splice donor site 105 bases 5-prime of exon 3 and results in
aberrant splicing of the mRNA. The authors proposed that this mutation
and others similar to it may account for a significant proportion of
9p21-linked melanoma pedigrees with no detectable mutations in the
coding region of CDKN2A.

.0015
MELANOMA, CUTANEOUS MALIGNANT, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 2
CDKN2A, GLY122ARG

Hewitt et al. (2002) reported a family harboring a splice mutation in
exon 1-beta of the CDKN2A gene that resulted in ARF haploinsufficiency.
The mutation was observed in a mother and daughter with melanoma and a
sib of the mother with breast cancer. The mutation was a 334G-C
transversion in exon 1-beta, which predicts a gly122-to-arg
substitution. Its position at the 3-prime end of exon 1-beta raised the
possibility of interference with splicing. Analysis of the melanoma from
1 individual revealed a 62-bp deletion in exon 3 of the wildtype allele
and loss of the mutant allele; these somatic changes would affect both
CDKN2A and ARF. The authors suggested that concomitant inactivation of
both ARF and CDKN2A may be necessary for melanoma development and that
mutations in ARF and CDKN2A possibly confer different levels of
susceptibility to melanoma, with the former associated with lesser
predisposition.

.0016
MELANOMA, CUTANEOUS MALIGNANT, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 2
CDKN2A, VAL59GLY

A val59-to-gly mutation in the CDKN2A gene was found in 4 families
segregating cutaneous malignant melanoma (155601): an Israeli family of
Moroccan Jewish ancestry (Yakobson et al., 2001), 2 French families (1
of Tunisian Jewish ancestry and another without known Jewish roots)
(Soufir et al., 1998), and a Spanish family (Ruiz et al., 1999).
Yakobson et al. (2003) found that all but 1 of those affected in these
families were heterozygous for the mutation; 1 affected member of the
Israeli family was homozygous. Haplotype analysis indicated a single
ancestral founder. The mutation, which occurs in a hydrophobic region
with the second ankyrin repeat, impairs p16-INK4a function, as shown by
studies of protein-protein interactions and cell proliferation assays.

.0017
MELANOMA, CUTANEOUS MALIGNANT, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 2
CDKN2A, LEU113LEU AND PRO114SER

In 4 affected members from 3 families and 1 isolated patient with
cutaneous malignant melanoma (155601), Kannengiesser et al. (2007)
identified a heterozygous tandem germline 339G-C transversion and 340C-T
transition in the CDKN2A gene, resulting in a leu113-to-leu (L113L) and
a pro114-to-ser (P114S) substitution, respectively. All families were
from southeastern France, and haplotype analysis indicated a founder
effect. The sporadic patient had a high sun exposure history and
Parkinson disease (168600) and received treatment with levodopa. He
subsequently developed 22 primary melanomas, suggesting that levodopa
may have contributed to the lesions. Further testing of this individual
showed 2 pathogenic variants in the MC1R gene (see, e.g., R151C;
155555.0004), which likely contributed to the severe phenotype.

MELANOMA, CUTANEOUS MALIGNANT, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 2
CDKN2A, SER56ILE

In affected members of 3 families with cutaneous malignant melanoma
(155601), Kannengiesser et al. (2007) identified a 167G-T transversion
in the CDKN2A gene, resulting in a ser56-to-ile (S56I) substitution. Two
patients were homozygous for the mutation, suggesting remote
consanguinity. All families were from southeastern France, and haplotype
analysis indicated a founder effect.

.0019
MELANOMA, CUTANEOUS MALIGNANT, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 2
CDKN2A, GLY89ASP

Goldstein et al. (2008) identified a gly89-to-asp (G89D) variant in the
CDKN2A gene that was associated with significantly increased risk for
cutaneous malignant melanoma (155601) in an Icelandic population. The
mutation results in a synonymous G143G change in the p14(ARF) protein.
The frequency of the G89D variant was 0.7 in melanoma patients compared
to 0.08 in controls. The association was strengthened when restricted to
invasive melanoma, present in 2% of patients (p = 0.0015). Relatives of
affected G89D carriers were at significantly increased risk of melanoma,
head and neck cancers, and pancreatic carcinoma compared to relatives of
other melanoma patients. Haplotype analysis indicated a founder effect.
The common ancestor was determined to be a female who lived in
Hunavatnssysla county in northern Iceland from about 1605-1665.

CDKN2A, IVS1BDS, A-G, +1

In affected members of 2 unrelated Italian families with malignant
melanoma (155601), Binni et al. (2010) identified a heterozygous A-to-G
transition in exon 1B of the CDKN2A gene, affecting splicing of the
p14(ARF) isoform. The families were ascertained from a large cohort of
155 Italian probands.

In affected members of an Italian family with malignant melanoma
(155601), Binni et al. (2010) identified a heterozygous 161G-A
transition in exon 1B of the CDKN2A gene, resulting in an arg54-to-his
(R54H) substitution in a highly conserved residue of the p14(ARF)
isoform. The family was ascertained from a large cohort of 155 Italian
probands.

MELANOMA-PANCREATIC CANCER SYNDROME
CDKN2A, 5-BP DUP, NT19

In 3 members of a family of Indonesian descent with pancreatic cancer
(606719), Harinck et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous 5-bp
duplication (19_23dup) in the CDKN2A gene, resulting in a frameshift and
premature termination. Although there were no cases of melanoma in this
family, Harinck et al. (2012) noted that the dark skin of the
individuals may have offered protection from developing melanoma.

604693	TITLE *604693 A-KINASE ANCHOR PROTEIN 7; AKAP7
;;A-KINASE ANCHOR PROTEIN, 18-KD; AKAP18
DESCRIPTION A-kinase anchor proteins (AKAPs; see 602449) direct the activity of
protein kinase A (PKA; see 176911) by tethering the enzyme near its
physiologic substrates.

By screening a fetal brain cDNA library with regulatory type II (RII)
PKA as a probe, Fraser et al. (1998) obtained a cDNA encoding a novel
AKAP protein, AKAP7, which the authors designated AKAP18. AKAP7 contains
81 amino acids. Northern blot analysis demonstrated the expression of a
major 2.9-kb transcript in pancreas, brain, and heart as well as a minor
band of 4.3 kb in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Helical wheel analysis
showed that the RII-binding amphipathic helix domain comprises residues
29 to 42. Sequence analysis identified a myristoylation signal at the
N-terminal glycine residue and 2 palmitoylation sites at cys4 and cys5.
Immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence confocal microscopy analyses
of wildtype and mutant AKAP18 showed that the lipids are required for
attachment of AKAP18 to the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane.
Expression of AKAP18 in cells expressing cardiac L-type calcium channels
promoted an increase in cAMP-responsive calcium currents, suggesting
that membrane anchoring of PKA participates in physiologically relevant
events involving ion channel activation.

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Corsortium mapped the AKAP7

PI4KII-ALPHA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Phosphatidylinositolpolyphosphates (PtdInsPs) are centrally involved in
many biologic processes, ranging from cell growth and organization of
the actin cytoskeleton to endo- and exocytosis. PI4KII phosphorylates
PtdIns at the D-4 position, an essential step in the biosynthesis of
PtdInsPs (Barylko et al., 2001).

CLONING

Minogue et al. (2001) partially purified PI4KII from plasma membrane
rafts isolated from human A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells. By peptide
sequencing, database analysis, and RT-PCR of A431 total RNA, they
obtained a full-length PI4KII cDNA. The deduced 479-amino acid protein
has a calculated molecular mass of about 54 kD. PI4KII has a kinase
domain and a leucine zipper, but no transmembrane sequence or acylation
motif. Northern blot analysis detected a 6.6-kb transcript in all
tissues examined. Expression was highest in kidney, brain, heart,
skeletal muscle, and placenta, and was lowest in colon, thymus, and
small intestine. Purified PI4KII had an apparent molecular mass of 52 kD
by SDS-PAGE.

Barylko et al. (2001) identified a cysteine-rich segment (CCPCC), a
potential palmitoylation site, in rat and human PI4KII.

By immunofluorescence localization, Wang et al. (2003) found that PI4KII
localized to the Golgi in transfected COS-7 cells.

Using microarray analysis, Li et al. (2010) found ubiquitous PI4K-alpha
expression, with higher levels in brain, kidney, stomach, and lung, and
lower levels in thyroid, dermis, breast, and fibrous tissue.

GENE FUNCTION

Minogue et al. (2001) assayed recombinant PI4KII expressed in bacteria
and found that it phosphorylated PtdIns, but not PtdIns3P, PtdIns4P, or
PtdIns5P. Like PI4KII purified from tissues, recombinant PI4KII was
activated by detergent and inhibited by adenosine.

Wang et al. (2003) found that overexpression of PI4KII in COS-7 cells
increased synthesis of PtdIns4P. Some cells overexpressing PI4KII had
scattered or no perinuclear Golgi. Knockdown of PI4KII by RNA
interference (RNAi) did not disrupt the Golgi, and some cells showed
expanded Golgi. RNAi reduced the Golgi level of PtdIns4P and blocked the
association between AP1 (see 607291) and the trans-Golgi network (TGN).
PI4KII RNAi had little effect on intra-Golgi trafficking, but it
inhibited TGN-to-plasma membrane export by 35%. Wang et al. (2003)
proposed that PI4KII generates PtdIns4P-rich domains within the Golgi
that specify docking of the AP1 coat machinery.

By screening a human kinase small interfering RNA library, Pan et al.
(2008) identified PI4KII-alpha and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate
5-kinase type I (PIP5KI; 603275) as required for Wnt3a (606359)-induced
LRP6 (603507) phosphorylation at ser1490 in mammalian cells and
confirmed that these kinases are important for Wnt signaling in Xenopus
embryos. Wnt3a stimulates the formation of phosphatidylinositol
4,5-bisphosphates through 'frizzled' (see 603408) and 'dishevelled' (see
601365), the latter of which directly interacted with and activated
PIP5KI. In turn, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphates regulated
phosphorylation of LRP6 at thr1479 and ser1490. Pan et al. (2008)
concluded that their study revealed a signaling mechanism for Wnt to
regulate LRP6 phosphorylation.

Li et al. (2010) found that PI4KII-alpha induced angiogenesis in mouse
and human cells via activation of a HER2 (ERBB2; 164870)-PI3K (see
PIK3CG; 601232)-ERK1 (MAPK3; 601795)/ERK2 (MAPK1; 176948) signaling
cascade, resulting in upregulation of HIF1-alpha (HIF1A; 603348) and
HIF1-alpha-dependent upregulation of VEGF (see VEGFA; 192240) and iNOS
(NOS2A; 163730). Downregulation of PI4KII in HeLa cells via RNA
interference did not cause cell death, but it reduced tumor growth
following inoculation of nude mice. Li et al. (2010) concluded that
PI4KII-alpha can contribute to tumorigenesis via induction of blood
vessel formation under anoxic conditions.

Jovic et al. (2012) found that the PtdIns4P-synthesizing enzymes
PI4KII-alpha and PI4KIII-beta (PI4KB; 602758) had distinct and
sequential roles in the lysosomal delivery of beta-glucosidase (GBA;
606463) and its receptor, LIMP2 (602257). Activity of PI4KIII-beta at
the Golgi was required to drive exit of LIMP2 from the Golgi, whereas
PI4KII-alpha at the trans-Golgi network regulated sorting of LIMP2
toward the late endosome/lysosome compartment. Knockdown or inhibition
of PI3KIII-beta led to accumulation of LIMP2 at the Golgi compartment,
and knockdown of either LIMP2 or PI4KII-alpha increased beta-GC
secretion. Mutations in PI4KII-alpha that disrupted its association with
AP3 (see AP3B1; 603401) disrupted lysosomal LIMP2 targeting.

MAPPING

Gross (2013) mapped the PI4K2A gene to chromosome 10q24.2 based on an
alignment of the PI4K2A sequence (GenBank GENBANK AJ303098) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using positional cloning methods, Wang et al. (1996) identified a gene,
which they called KVLQT1, within the critical region for long QT
syndrome-1 locus (LQT1; 192500) on chromosome 11. They also determined
that mutations in this gene are responsible for the disorder. KVLQT1 is
strongly expressed in the heart and encodes a protein with structural
features of a voltage-gated potassium channel. The longest open reading
frame of the KVLQT1 cDNA spans 1,645 bp.

Sanguinetti et al. (1996) identified an apparently full-length human
cDNA clone for KVLQT1. This clone predicted a 581-amino acid protein. By
Northern blot analysis they detected a single 3.2-kb mRNA in human
pancreas, heart, kidney, lung, and placenta. No message was detected in
brain, liver, or skeletal muscle.

Yang et al. (1997) described the cloning of a full-length KVLQT1 cDNA
encoding a 676-amino acid polypeptide with structural characteristics
similar to voltage-gated potassium channels.

Barhanin et al. (1996) cloned a full-length KVLQT1 cDNA from a mouse
heart library. Its sequence revealed an open reading frame encoding a
604-amino acid polypeptide sharing 90.5% identity with a human KVLQT1
partial sequence. Hydrophobicity analysis predicted a classic
voltage-dependent potassium channel topology with 6 transmembrane
segments (of the Shaker type) and a long unique C-terminal cytoplasmic
domain.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Splawski et al. (1998) found that the
KCNQ1 gene contains 16 exons and spans 400 kb. The exon sizes range from
47 to 1,122 bp. Neyroud et al. (1999) comprehensively detailed the
genomic structure of KCNQ1. They determined that the gene contains 19
exons and spans more than 400 kb on chromosome 11p15.5. The authors
presented the sequences of exon-intron boundaries and of oligonucleotide
primers designed to allow PCR amplification of all exons from genomic
DNA.

MAPPING

By positional cloning methods, Wang et al. (1996) identified the KVLQT1
gene within the critical region for long QT syndrome on chromosome
11p15. Sanguinetti et al. (1996) showed that a fragment of the KVLQT1
cDNA mapped to the short arm of chromosome 11.

GENE FUNCTION

To define the function of the KVLQT1 gene, Sanguinetti et al. (1996)
transfected KVLQT1 cDNA into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The
biophysical properties of the transfected KVLQT1 cDNA clone were unlike
those of other known cardiac potassium channels. Through cotransfection
studies, they demonstrated that KVLQT1 and ISK (KCNE1; 176261)
coassemble to form the cardiac I(Ks) channel. They noted that 2
delayed-rectifier potassium channels, I(Kr) and I(Ks), modulate action
potential duration in cardiac myocytes and that dysfunction of both of
the channels contributes to the risk of sudden death from cardiac
arrhythmia.

Barhanin et al. (1996) expressed KVLQT1 in COS cells and carried out
electrophysiologic studies. They demonstrated that KVLQT1 encodes a
subunit forming the cardiac ion channel underlying the I(Ks) cardiac
current. They observed, however, that an additional subunit, ISK, was
required to form the I(Ks) channel. Barhanin et al. (1996) noted that
the I(Kr) and the I(Ks) currents are the targets of antiarrhythmic drugs
and have an important impact in controlling the ventricular
repolarization process. They postulated that the molecular
identification of the I(Ks) channel should help with the design of new
antiarrhythmic drugs.

Expression of KVLQT1 in Xenopus oocytes and human embryonic kidney cells
by Yang et al. (1997) elicited a rapidly activating, K(+)-selective
outward current. They found that clofilium, a class III antiarrhythmic
agent with the propensity to induce torsade de pointes, substantially
inhibited the current. Elevation of cAMP levels in oocytes nearly
doubled the amplitude of KVLQT1 currents.

Marx et al. (2002) demonstrated that beta-adrenergic receptor modulation
of the slow outward potassium ion current (I-KS) requires targeting of
cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (188830) and protein phosphatase 1 (PP1;
e.g., 176875) to KCNQ1 through the targeting protein yotiao (604001).
Yotiao binds to KCNQ1 by a leucine zipper motif, which is disrupted by
an LQTS mutation (KCNQ1-G589D; 607542.0029). Identification of the KCNQ1
macromolecular complex provides a mechanism for sympathetic nervous
system modulation of cardiac action potential duration through I-KS.

Melman et al. (2004) showed that multiple segments of KCNQ1, including
the pore and C terminus, bind the accessory proteins KCNE1 and KCNE3
(604433). They demonstrated that all KCNE-binding sites of KCNQ1 are
required for proper regulation by the accessory subunit.

To resolve the controversy about messengers regulating KCNQ ion channels
during phospholipase C (see 600810)-mediated suppression of current, Suh
et al. (2006) designed translocatable enzymes that quickly altered the
phosphoinositide composition of the plasma membrane after application of
a chemical cue. The KCNQ current fell rapidly to zero when
phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate was depleted without changing
calcium ion, diacylglycerol, or inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Current
rose by 30% when phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate was overproduced
and did not change when phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate was
raised. Hence Suh et al. (2006) concluded that the depletion of
phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate suffices to suppress current
fully, and other second messengers are not needed. Furthermore, their
development of these new compounds allowed additional study of biologic
signaling networks involving membrane phosphoinositides.

Roepke et al. (2009) demonstrated that both KCNQ1 and KCNE2 (603796)
were expressed and partially colocalized in human and mouse thyroid
glands with the basolaterally located Na(+)/I(-) symporter (NIS) that
mediates active I(-) transport, the first step in thyroid hormone
biosynthesis. Using the rat thyroid-derived FRTL5 cell line, the authors
detected endogenous expression of KCNQ1 and KCNE2 proteins that was
upregulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH; see 188540) or its
major downstream effector cAMP in the cell membrane fraction. The
authors identified a TSH-stimulated K(+) current in FRTL5 cells that
bore the signature linear current-voltage relationship of KCNQ1-KCNE2
channels and was inhibited by a KCNQ1-specific antagonist. Kcne2 -/-
pups nursing from Kcne2 -/- dams had an 87% reduction in thyroid I(-)
accumulation compared to wildtype pups. Roepke et al. (2009) concluded
that the potassium channel subunits KCNQ1 and KCNE2 form a
TSH-stimulated constitutively active thyrocyte K(+) channel that is
required for normal thyroid hormone biosynthesis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Long QT Syndrome

Discrepancies in the codon numbers of the allelic variants exist because
of changes in information about the sequence of KCNQ1. Yang et al.
(1997) demonstrated that the full-length KCNQ1 cDNA codes for 676 amino
acids. Thus, for example, the A341V mutation (607542.0010), one of the
most frequent causes of type 1 long QT syndrome (192500), was denoted
A212V by Wang et al. (1996) and A246V by Li et al. (1998).

Wang et al. (1996) found KVLQT1 mutations in affected members of 16
families with long QT syndrome-1, including 1 intragenic deletion and 10
different missense mutations (e.g., 607542.0001). Shalaby et al. (1997)
used site-directed mutagenesis to generate 3 mutant human KVLQT1 cDNAs,
equivalent to mutations previously described by Wang et al. (1996). The
corresponding mutant KVLQT1 proteins were coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes
with wildtype KVLQT1 and minK (176261) proteins. Channel currents were
studied using a voltage clamp technique. Shalaby et al. (1997) showed
that mutations in the putative cytoplasmic loop (e.g., 607542.0002) and
pore signature sequence (e.g., 607542.0008) abolished KVLQT1 activity
when expressed individually. A mutation in the transmembrane region
(e.g., 607542.0006) significantly reduced KVLQT1 activity. When
coexpressed with wildtype KVLQT1 protein with or without minK protein,
each mutant exerted a dominant-negative effect on the wildtype KVLQT1
current. Shalaby et al. (1997) concluded that in patients carrying such
mutant alleles, diminution in the repolarizing I(ks) current would
result in prolongation of the cardiac action potential and predispose to
cardiac arrhythmias.

Russell et al. (1996) used SSCP analysis to screen 2 large and 9 small
LQT families for mutations of the KVLQT1 potassium channel gene. They
identified a novel missense mutation in 2 unrelated families: a
gly314-to-ser substitution (607542.0012) in the KVLQT1 gene. In a third
family, an ala341-to-val substitution (607542.0010) resulted in the
spontaneous occurrence of LQT in monozygotic twin offspring of
unaffected parents. Russell et al. (1996) noted that mutations at this
same nucleotide had been observed in 8 of 19 LQT families determined to
have KVLQT1 mutations to that time, suggesting a mutation hotspot. Both
of the mutations reported in this study occurred at CpG dinucleotides.
Russell et al. (1996) observed that both of the mutations alter the
amino acid sequence in, or adjacent to, the pore of the channel and may
diminish the channel's ability to conduct a repolarizing potassium
current. Russell et al. (1996) reported that their data confirm the role
of KVLQT1 in LQT. They noted that all the KVLQT1 mutations reported to
that time were missense mutations and suggested that mutant KVLQT1
proteins may exert a dominant-negative effect on repolarizing potassium
currents by forming multimers with normal potassium channel protein
subunits, dramatically reducing the number of fully functional KVLQT1
channels.

Among 32 Japanese families with LQT, Tanaka et al. (1997) identified
mutations in KCNQ1 in 4 families comprising 16 patients.

Jongbloed et al. (1999) screened 24 Dutch LQTS families for mutations in
the KCNQ1 and HERG genes. Fourteen missense mutations were identified.
Eight of these missense mutations were novel: 3 in the KCNQ1 gene and 5
in the HERG gene. The KCNQ1 mutation G189R (607542.0003) and the novel
HERG mutation R582C (607542.0009) were detected in 2 families each.
Genotype-phenotype studies indicated that auditory stimuli trigger
cardiac events differentiating LQTS2 from LQTS1. In LQTS1, exercise was
the predominant trigger. In addition, a number of asymptomatic gene
defect carriers were identified. Jongbloed et al. (1999) concluded that
asymptomatic carriers are still at risk of the development of
life-threatening arrhythmias, underlining the importance of DNA analysis
for unequivocal diagnosis of patients with LQTS.

Neyroud et al. (1999) identified 5 novel mutations in LQTS patients
within the C-terminal part of KCNQ1 (see 607542.0025, 607542.0026, and
607542.0027). Neyroud et al. (1999) commented that the low mutation
detection rate in large cohorts of LQTS patients may reflect the fact
that the C-terminal region had not been analyzed to that time.

A comprehensive review of the genetic and molecular basis of long QT
syndromes was given by Priori et al. (1999, 1999).

In 2 severely affected sisters from a large Belgian family with LQTS,
Berthet et al. (1999) identified biallelic digenic mutations: a missense
mutation in the KCNQ1 gene (A341E; 607542.0009) and a splice site
mutation in the KCNH2 gene (2592+1G-A; 152427.0019). Berthet et al.
(1999) stated that this was the first description of double
heterozygosity in long QT syndrome.

Splawski et al. (2000) screened 262 unrelated individuals with LQT
syndrome for mutations in the 5 defined genes (KCNQ1; KCNH2, 152427;
SCN5A, 600163; KCNE1; and KCNE2) and identified mutations in 177
individuals (68%). KCNQ1 and KCNH2 accounted for 87% of mutations (42%
and 45%, respectively), and SCN5A, KCNE1, and KCNE2 for the remaining
13% (8%, 3%, and 2%, respectively).

Yang et al. (2002) analyzed the KCNQ1, KCNH2, and SCN5A genes in 92
patients with drug-induced long QT syndrome and identified 2 missense
mutations, 1 in KCNQ1 (607542.0031) and 1 in KCNH2 (152427.0014), not
found in 228 controls, that were shown to reduce K+ currents in vitro.

In a 13-year-old girl with long QT syndrome, Aizawa et al. (2004)
identified a frameshift mutation in the KCNQ1 gene (607542.0036) that
eliminates the S3 to S6 domains and the C terminus of the KCNQ1 channel.
Coexpression experiments in COS-7 cells showed that mutant and wildtype
KCNQ1 remained within the cytoplasm rather than being distributed to the
plasma membrane. Aizawa et al. (2004) suggested that the truncated
mutant forms a heteromultimer with wildtype KCNQ1 and causes a
dominant-negative effect due to a trafficking defect.

Tester et al. (2005) analyzed 5 LQTS-associated cardiac channel genes in
541 consecutive unrelated patients with LQT syndrome (average QTc, 482
ms). In 272 (50%) patients, they identified 211 different pathogenic
mutations, including 88 in KCNQ1, 89 in KCNH2, 32 in SCN5A, and 1 each
in KCNE1 and KCNE2. Mutations considered pathogenic were absent in more
than 1,400 reference alleles. Among the mutation-positive patients, 29
(11%) had 2 LQTS-causing mutations, of which 16 (8%) were in 2 different
LQTS genes (biallelic digenic). Tester et al. (2005) noted that patients
with multiple mutations were younger at diagnosis, but they did not
discern any genotype/phenotype correlations associated with location or
type of mutation.

In 44 unrelated patients with LQT syndrome, Millat et al. (2006) used
DHLP chromatography to analyze the KCNQ1, KCNH2, SCN5A, KCNE1, and KCNE2
genes for mutations and SNPs. Most of the patients (84%) showed a
complex molecular pattern, with an identified mutation associated with 1
or more SNPs located in several LQTS genes; 4 of the patients also had a
second mutation in a different LQTS gene (biallelic digenic inheritance;
see, e.g., 607542.0038 and 607542.0039).

Arbour et al. (2008) identified a missense mutation (607542.0040)
causing long QT syndrome-1 among a First Nations community of northern
British Columbia.

- Jervell and Lange-Nielsen Syndrome

Neyroud et al. (1997) used homozygosity mapping to locate the gene for
the Jervell and Lange-Nielsen cardioauditory syndrome (JLNS1; 220400) to
the same region of 11p15.5 where the KVLQT1 gene maps. In 3 affected
children of 2 families with the disorder, they demonstrated homozygosity
for a deletion-insertion mutation in the C-terminal domain of the KVLQT1
gene (607542.0013). They noted that this is another instance of dominant
or recessive inheritance of disorders due to different mutations in the
same gene. Schmitt et al. (2000) identified a small domain between
residues 589 and 620 in the KCNQ1 C terminus that may function as an
assembly domain for KCNQ1 subunits. KCNQ1 C termini do not assemble and
KCNQ1 subunits do not express functional potassium channels without this
domain. The authors showed that the deletion-insertion mutation at KCNQ1
residue 540 identified by Neyroud et al. (1997) eliminated important
parts of the C-terminal assembly domain. Therefore, JLNS mutants may be
defective in KCNQ1 subunit assembly. The results provided a molecular
basis for the clinical observation that heterozygous JLNS carriers show
slight cardiac dysfunction and that the severe JLNS phenotype is
characterized by the absence of the KCNQ1 channel.

Tyson et al. (2000) studied 10 JLNS families from Great Britain and
Norway and identified 9 different mutations in the KCNQ1 gene, 2 of
which were novel. Truncation of the protein proximal to the C-terminal
assembly domain was expected to preclude assembly of KCNQ1 monomers into
tetramers, explaining the recessive inheritance of JLNS.

- Familial Atrial Fibrillation

Chen et al. (2003) identified a missense mutation, ser140 to gly
(607542.0032), in the KCNQ1 gene in autosomal dominant atrial
fibrillation (607554). Functional analysis of this mutant revealed a
gain-of-function effect on the KCNQ1/KCNE1 and KCNQ1/KCNE2 currents,
which contrasts with the dominant-negative or loss-of-function effects
of the KCNQ1 mutations previously identified in patients with long QT
syndrome. Chen et al. (2003) concluded that the ser140-to-gly mutation
is likely to initiate and maintain atrial fibrillation by reducing
action potential duration and effective refractory period in atrial
myocytes.

- Short QT Syndrome

In a 70-year-old man with short QT syndrome-2 (SQT2; 609621) who
survived an episode of ventricular fibrillation, Bellocq et al. (2004)
identified a missense mutation in the KCNQ1 gene (607542.0037).
Functional studies of the mutant channel revealed that both a pronounced
shift of the half-activation potential and an acceleration of the
activation kinetics led to a gain of function in I(Ks).

- Imprinting

Genomic imprinting is the process by which a subset of mammalian genes
is 'marked' during gametogenesis such that they are expressed
differentially in somatic cells depending on their parental origin. This
mark may be differential methylation, because DNA methylation is
necessary for the proper regulation of imprinted genes. Furthermore,
some differentially methylated regions (DMRs) are thought to represent
gametic imprints, because they are differentially methylated in male and
female germ cells and remain so throughout development. The DMRs of most
imprinted genes are associated with short, G-rich, direct repeat
sequences, which may facilitate heterochromatization and gene silencing
at imprinted loci. Another characteristic of imprinted genes is their
association, in some cases, with imprinted antisense RNA transcripts. At
the paternally expressed mouse and human IGF2 (147470) and ZPF127 loci,
antisense transcripts that are also expressed paternally have been
identified and overlap with the protein coding gene. For the maternally
expressed IGF2R (147280) and UBE3A (601623) genes, overlapping antisense
transcripts have been found and are oppositely imprinted with respect to
the protein coding gene. Antisense transcripts may serve to regulate
overlapping genes by promoter or transcript occlusion or by competing
with these loci for regulatory elements such as transcription factors or
enhancers (Smilinich et al., 1999). Imprinting control elements are
proposed to exist within the KVLQT1 locus, because multiple chromosome
rearrangements associated with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS; 130650)
disrupt this gene.

Lee et al. (1997) demonstrated that the KVLQT1 gene spans much of the
interval between p57(KIP2) (CDKN1C; 600856) and IGF2 and that, like
those 2 genes, it is imprinted. They demonstrated, furthermore, that the
KVLQT1 gene is disrupted by chromosomal rearrangements in patients with
Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, as well as by a balanced chromosomal
translocation in an embryonal rhabdoid tumor. They concluded that the
lack of parent-of-origin effect in the long QT syndrome (192500) must
reflect a relative lack of imprinting in the affected tissue, cardiac
muscle, thereby representing a novel mechanism for incomplete penetrance
of a human disease gene. Mannens and Wilde (1997) and Barlow (1997)
discussed the findings of Lee et al. (1997) and Neyroud et al. (1997)
and hypothesized that aberrant expression of the KVLQT1 gene may be
responsible for the profound growth abnormalities seen in BWS. Four
isoforms of KVLQT1 exist, 2 of which (isoforms 3 and 4) seem to be
untranslated. KVLQT1 imprinting may be associated with specific
isoforms, as has been shown for IGF2. KVLQT1 isoform 2 seems to be most
abundant in heart and is probably biallelically expressed. Isoform 1 is
expressed in multiple tissues and is most likely paternally imprinted.
The tissue-specific imprinting of KVLQT1 and the presence of multiple
isoforms might explain the various modes of inheritance seen in LQT,
JLNS, and BWS.

Smilinich et al. (1999) identified an evolutionarily conserved,
maternally methylated CpG island, which they called KVDMR1, in an intron
of the KVLQT1 gene. Among 12 cases of BWS with normal H19 methylation, 5
showed demethylation of KVDMR1 in fibroblast or lymphocyte DNA; on the
other hand, in 4 cases of BWS with H19 hypermethylation, methylation at
KVDMR1 was normal. Thus, inactivation of H19 and hypomethylation of
KVDMR1 (or an associated phenomenon) represented distinct epigenetic
anomalies associated with biallelic expression of IGF2. Reverse
transcription-PCR analysis of the human and syntenic mouse loci
identified a KVDMR1-associated RNA transcribed exclusively from the
paternal allele and in the opposite orientation with respect to the
maternally expressed KVLQT1 gene. Smilinich et al. (1999) proposed that
KVDMR1 and/or its associated antisense RNA represents an additional
imprinting control element or center in human 11p15.5 and mouse distal 7
imprinted domains.

To explore the importance of imprinted gene clustering, Cleary et al.
(2001) used the Cre/loxP recombination system to disrupt a cluster of
imprinted genes on mouse distal chromosome 7. In mice carrying a
site-specific translocation, t(7;11), separating Cdkn1c and Kcnq1,
imprinting of the genes retained on chromosome 7, including Kcnq1,
Kcnq1ot1 (604115), Ascl2 (601886), H19 (103280), and Igf2 (147470), was
unaffected, demonstrating that these genes are not regulated by elements
near or telomeric to Cdkn1c. In contrast, expression and imprinting of
the translocated Cdkn1c, Slc22a1l (602631), and Tssc3 (602131) genes on
chromosome 11 were affected, consistent with the hypothesis that
elements regulating both expression and imprinting of these genes lie
within or proximal to Kcnq1. The findings supported the proposal that
chromosomal abnormalities, including translocations, within KCNQ1 that
are associated with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome may disrupt CDKN1C
expression.

One-third of individuals with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome lose
maternal-specific methylation at KvDMR1, a putative imprinting control
region within intron 10 of the KCNQ1 gene (Lee et al., 1999; Smilinich
et al., 1999; Engel et al., 2000). It has been proposed that this
epimutation results in aberrant imprinting and, consequently, BWS.
Fitzpatrick et al. (2002) showed that paternal inheritance of this
mutation in mice results in the derepression in cis of 6 genes,
including Cdkn1c, which encodes cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1C.
Furthermore, fetuses and adult mice that inherited the deletion from
their fathers were 20 to 25% smaller than their wildtype littermates. By
contrast, maternal inheritance of this deletion had no effect on
imprinted gene expression or growth. Thus, the unmethylated paternal
KvDMR1 allele regulates imprinted expression by silencing genes on the
paternal chromosome. These findings supported the hypothesis that loss
of methylation in BWS patients activates the repressive function of
KvDMR1 on the maternal chromosome, resulting in abnormal silencing of
CDKN1C and the development of BWS.

Mancini-DiNardo et al. (2003) showed that the imprinting control region
(ICR) on mouse distal chromosome 7 contains a promoter for a paternally
expressed antisense transcript, Kcnq1ot1. Three paternal-specific
nuclease-hypersensitive sites, which are required for full promoter
activity, lie immediately upstream from the start site. The expression
of Kcnq1ot1 during pre- and postnatal development was compared to that
of other imprinted genes in its vicinity, Cdkn1c (600856) and Kcnq1; a
lack of coordination in their expression did not support an enhancer
competition model for the action of the ICR in imprinting control. Using
a stable transfection assay, the authors showed that the region contains
a position-independent and orientation-independent silencer. The authors
proposed that the Kcnq1 ICR may function as a silencer on the paternal
chromosome to effect the repression of neighboring genes.

Imboden et al. (2006) investigated the distribution of mutant alleles
for the long-QT syndrome in 484 nuclear families with type I disease
(LQT1 due to mutation in the KCNQ1 gene) and 269 nuclear families with
type II disease (LQT2 (613688) due to mutation in the KCNH2 gene;
152427). In offspring of the female carriers of LQT1 or male and female
carriers of LQT2, classic mendelian inheritance ratios were not
observed. Among the 1,534 descendants, the proportion of genetically
affected offspring was significantly greater than that expected
according to mendelian inheritance: 870 were carriers of a mutation
(57%), and 664 were noncarriers (43%) (P less than 0.001). Among the 870
carriers, the allele for the long-QT syndrome was transmitted more often
to female offspring (476; 55%) than to male offspring (394; 45%) (P =
0.005). Increased maternal transmission of the long QT syndrome to
daughters was also observed, possibly contributing to the excess of
female patients with autosomal dominant long QT syndrome.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

The relation of ion channels to disease was comprehensively reviewed by
Ackerman and Clapham (1997).

In a large collaborative study, Zareba et al. (1998) demonstrated that
the genotype of the long QT syndrome influences the clinical course. The
risk of cardiac events (syncope, aborted cardiac arrest, or sudden
death) was significantly higher among subjects with mutations at the
LQT1 or LQT2 locus than among those with mutations at the LQT3 locus.
Although the cumulative mortality was similar regardless of the
genotype, the percentage of cardiac events that were lethal was
significantly higher in families with mutations at the LQT3 locus. In
this large study, 112 patients had mutations at the LQT1 locus, 72 at
the LQT2 locus, and 62 at the LQT3 locus. Thus, paradoxically, cardiac
events were less frequent in LQT3 but more likely to be lethal; the
likelihood of dying during a cardiac event was 20% in families with an
LQT3 mutation and 4% with either an LQT1 or an LQT2 mutation.

Using SSCP and DNA sequence analyses, Chen et al. (2003) studied the
KCNQ1 gene in 102 families with a history of lethal cardiac events: 55
LQTS, 9 Brugada syndrome (601144), 18 idiopathic ventricular
fibrillation (IVF; 603829), and 20 acquired LQTS. Families found to have
KCNQ1 mutations were phenotyped using ECG parameters and cardiac event
history, and genotype-phenotype correlation was performed. No mutations
were found in Brugada syndrome, IVF, or acquired LQTS families. Of the
55 LQTS families, 10 had KCNQ1 mutations and 62 carriers were
identified. Five novel mutations were identified. There were 6 instances
of sudden death and in 2 of these, death was the first symptom. The
findings of this study emphasized the reduced penetrance of both the
long QT and symptoms, resulting in diagnostic challenges, and the
importance of genetic testing for identification of gene carriers with
reduced penetrance in order to provide treatment and prevent lethal
cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death.

Westenskow et al. (2004) analyzed the KCNQ1, KCNH2, SCN5A, KCNE1, and
KCNE2 genes in 252 probands with long QT syndrome and identified 19 with
biallelic mutations in LQTS genes, of whom 18 were either compound
(monogenic) or double (digenic) heterozygotes and 1 was a homozygote.
They also identified 1 patient who had triallelic digenic mutations (see
152427.0021). Compared with probands who had 1 or no identified
mutation, probands with 2 mutations had longer QTc intervals (p less
than 0.001) and were 3.5-fold more likely to undergo cardiac arrest (p
less than 0.01). Voltage clamp studies in Xenopus oocytes coexpressing
wildtype and variant subunits demonstrated a reduction in I(Ks) density
that was equivalent to the additive effects of the single mutations.
Westenskow et al. (2004) concluded that biallelic mono- or digenic
mutations (which the authors termed 'compound mutations') cause a severe
phenotype and are relatively common in long QT syndrome. The authors
noted that these findings support the concept of arrhythmia risk as a
multi-hit process and suggested that genotype can be used to predict
risk.

ANIMAL MODEL

To produce a mouse model for Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome,
Casimiro et al. (2001) generated a line of transgenic mice that had a
targeted disruption in the Kcnq1 gene. Behavioral analysis demonstrated
that the homozygous-null mice were deaf and exhibited a shaker-waltzer
phenotype. Histologic analysis of the inner ear structures of these mice
showed gross morphologic anomalies because of drastic reduction in the
volume of endolymph. ECGs recorded from the null mice demonstrated
abnormal T- and P-wave morphologies and prolongation of the QT and JT
intervals when measured in vivo, but not in isolated hearts. These
changes were indicative of cardiac repolarization defects that appear to
be induced by extracardiac signals.

Casimiro et al. (2004) noted that Kcnq1 knockout results in mice with
more severe defects than those in human LQT1 or JLNS1. They developed
mouse lines with point mutations in the Kcnq1 gene that cause LQT1 in
humans. Mice with an ala340-to-glu mutation had normal hearing but a
long QT and therefore modeled patients with LQT1. Mice with a
thr311-to-ile mutation phenocopied JLNS1, but they also displayed the
shaker/waltzer defect, which is specific to mouse.

Imprinted genes are clustered in domains, and their allelic repression
is mediated by imprinting control regions. These imprinting control
regions are marked by DNA methylation, which is essential to maintain
imprinting in the embryo. To explore how imprinting is regulated in
placenta, Umlauf et al. (2004) studied the Kcnq1 domain on mouse distal
chromosome 7. This large domain is controlled by an intronic imprinting
control region (Fitzpatrick et al., 2002; Mancini-DiNardo et al., 2003)
and comprises multiple genes that are imprinted in placenta, without the
involvement of promoter DNA methylation. Umlauf et al. (2004) found that
the paternal repression along the domain involves acquisition of
trimethylation at lys27 and dimethylation at lys9 of histone H3 (see
602810). Eed (605984)-Ezh2 (601573) Polycomb complexes are recruited to
the paternal chromosome and potentially regulate its repressive histone
methylation. Studies on embryonic stem cells and early embryos supported
the proposal of Umlauf et al. (2004) that chromatin repression is
established early in development and is maintained in the placenta. In
the embryo, on the other hand, imprinting is stably maintained only at
genes that have promoter DNA methylation. Random X inactivation in the
embryo proper also involves repressive histone methylation and
recruitment of Eed-Ezh2 complexes (Silva et al., 2003). Umlauf et al.
(2004) concluded that their data underscored the importance of histone
methylation in placental imprinting and identified mechanistic
similarities with X chromosome inactivation in extraembryonic tissues,
suggesting that the 2 epigenetic mechanisms are evolutionarily linked.

Studying imprinting in the placenta in the region of distal mouse
chromosome 7, Lewis et al. (2004) found that the silent paternal alleles
of imprinted genes are marked in the trophoblast by repressive histone
modifications (dimethylation at lys9 of histone H3 and trimethylation at
lys27 of histone H3), which were disrupted when imprinting center-2
(IC2) on mouse distal chromosome 7 was deleted. The deletion led to
reactivation of the paternal alleles. Lewis et al. (2004) proposed that
an evolutionarily older imprinting mechanism limited to extraembryonic
tissues was based on histone modifications.

Elso et al. (2004) characterized 2 mouse lines carrying mutant alleles
of Kcnq1, which very rapidly established chronic gastritis in a
bacterial pathogen-exposed environment. Independent of infection, mutant
mice developed gastric hyperplasia, hypochlorhydria, and mucin
dysregulation, as well as metaplasia, dysplasia, and premalignant
adenomatous hyperplasia of the stomach.

Using pharmacologic inhibition and gene knockout in mice, Vallon et al.
(2005) demonstrated the importance of Kcnq1 channel complexes in
maintenance of the driving force for proximal tubular and intestinal Na+
absorption, gastric acid secretion, and cAMP-induced jejunal Cl-
secretion. In the kidney, Kcnq1 was dispensable under basal conditions;
however, luminal Kcnq1 repolarized the proximal tubule and stabilized
the driving force for Na+ reabsorption under conditions of increased
glucose or amino acid resorption. In mice lacking functional Kcnq1,
impaired intestinal absorption was associated with reduced serum vitamin
B12 concentrations, mild macrocytic anemia, and fecal loss of Na+ and
K+, the latter affecting K+ homeostasis.

In studies of Drosophila, Ocorr et al. (2007) observed a markedly
elevated incidence of cardiac dysfunction and arrhythmias in aging fruit
fly hearts and a concomitant decrease in expression of Kcnq, which is
the Drosophila homolog of human KCNQ1. Hearts from young Kcnq-mutant
fruit flies exhibited arrhythmias reminiscent of torsade de pointes and
had severely increased susceptibility to pacing-induced cardiac
dysfunction at young ages, characteristics that are observed only at
advanced ages in wildtype flies. Alterations in rhythmicity of the
mutant flies was rescued by transgenic wildtype Kcnq, and heart-specific
Kcnq overexpression in old wildtype flies reversed the age-dependent
increase in arrhythmias. Ocorr et al. (2007) suggested that an
age-dependent decrease in KCNQ1 expression within the heart may
contribute to the increased incidence of arrhythmia observed with age.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
LONG QT SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, 3-BP DEL

Using SSCP analysis, Wang et al. (1996) demonstrated a deletion in the
KVLQT1 gene in a sporadic case of LQT1 (192500). Deletion of 3
nucleotides, TCG, changed codon 72 from TTC (phe) to TGG (trp) and
deleted the first G of codon 73. (Codon 72 used to be known as codon 38
and codon 73 as codon 39.)

.0002
LONG QT SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, ALA178PRO

Using SSCP analysis, Wang et al. (1996) found a GCC (ala) to CCC (pro)
transversion in codon 83 of the KVLQT1 gene in a sporadic case of LQT1
(192500). (This variant used to be known as ALA49PRO and ALA83PRO.)

.0003
LONG QT SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, GLY189ARG

In a family in which 3 members had LQT1 (192500), Wang et al. (1996)
demonstrated a GGG (gly) to AGG (arg) transition in codon 189 of the
KVLQT1 gene. Jongbloed et al. (1999) identified this mutation in 2
families with LQT1. (This variant used to be known as GLY60ARG and
GLY94ARG.)

.0004
LONG QT SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, ARG190GLN

In a family with 2 members affected by LQT1 (192500), Wang et al. (1996)
used SSCP analysis to demonstrate a CGG (arg) to CAG (gln) transition in
codon 95 of the KVLQT1 gene. (This variant used to be known as ARG61GLN
and ARG95GLN.)

Moretti et al. (2010) reported the creation of patient-specific induced
pluripotent stem (IPS) cells containing the R190Q mutation in KCNQ1.
They compared IPS cells derived from dermal fibroblasts from 2 patients
with this mutation with those from 2 control individuals. The cells were
able to generate functional myocytes that showed a ventricular, atrial,
or nodal phenotype, as evidenced by expression of cell type-specific
markers and as seen in recordings of the action potentials in single
cells. The duration of the action potential was markedly prolonged in
ventricular and atrial cells derived from patients with LQTS1, as
compared with cells from control subjects. Further characterization of
the role of the R190Q KCNQ1 mutation in the pathogenesis of LQTS1
revealed a dominant-negative trafficking defect associated with a 70 to
80% reduction in I(Ks) current and altered channel activation and
deactivation properties. Moreover, Moretti et al. (2010) showed that
myocytes derived from patients with LQTS1 had an increased
susceptibility to catecholamine-induced tachyarrhythmia and that
beta-blockade attenuated this phenotype, as was demonstrated in the
patients themselves.

.0005
LONG QT SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, VAL254MET

In a kindred in which 70 members were affected by LQT1 (192500), Wang et
al. (1996) used SSCP analysis to demonstrate a GTG (val) to ATG (met)
transition in codon 159 of the KVLQT1 gene. (This variant used to be
known as VAL125MET and VAL159MET.)

.0006
LONG QT SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, LEU273PHE

In a kindred in which 2 members were affected by LQT1 (192500), Wang et
al. (1996) demonstrated a CTC (leu) to TTC (phe) transition in codon 273
of the KVLQT1 gene. (This variant used to be known as LEU144PHE and
LEU178PHE.)

.0007
LONG QT SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, GLY306ARG

In a sporadic case of LQT1 (192500), Wang et al. (1996) demonstrated a
GGG (gly) to AGG (arg) transition in codon 211 of the KVLQT1 gene. (This
mutation used to be known as GLY177ARG and GLY211ARG.)

.0008
LONG QT SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, THR312ILE

In a sporadic case of LQT1 (192500), Wang et al. (1996) demonstrated a
ACC (thr) to ATC (ile) transition in codon 217 of the KVLQT1 gene. (This
mutation used to be known as THR183ILE and THR217ILE.)

.0009
LONG QT SYNDROME 1
LONG QT SYNDROME 1/2, DIGENIC, INCLUDED
KCNQ1, ALA341GLU

In 2 kindreds with 8 members affected by LQT1 (192500), Wang et al.
(1996) demonstrated a GCG (ala) to GAG (glu) transversion in codon 341
(A341E) of the KCNQ1 gene. (This variant used to be known as ALA212GLU
and ALA246GLU.)

In 2 severely affected sisters from a large Belgian family with long QT
syndrome (see 192500), Berthet et al. (1999) identified biallelic
digenic mutations: the A341E substitution in exon 6, within the S6
transmembrane domain of KCNQ1; and a splice site mutation in the KCNH2
gene (2592+1G-A; 152427.0019). The father and his affected relatives
were heterozygous for the A341E mutation in KCNQ1; the mother, a more
mildly affected sister, and a grandson were heterozygous for the splice
site mutation in KCNH2. Neither mutation was found in 2 unaffected sibs
or in other unaffected family members. Berthet et al. (1999) stated that
this was the first description of double heterozygosity in long QT
syndrome.

.0010
LONG QT SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, ALA341VAL

In 5 kindreds with 47 members affected by LQT1 (192500), Wang et al.
(1996) demonstrated a GCG (ala) to GTG (val) transversion in codon 341
of the KVLQT1 gene. Russell et al. (1996) detected this mutation in the
spontaneous occurrence of LQT in monozygotic twin offspring of normal
parents. This mutation would be expected to encode a potassium channel
with altered conductance properties. They noted that mutations at this
same nucleotide have been observed in 8 of 19 LQT families determined to
have KVLQT1 mutations to that time, suggesting a mutation hotspot. (This
variant used to be known as ALA212VAL and ALA246VAL.)

.0011
LONG QT SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, GLY345GLU

In a family with 11 members affected by LQT1 (192500), Wang et al.
(1996) demonstrated a GGG (gly) to GAG (glu) transversion in codon 250
of the KVLQT1 gene. (This variant used to be known as GLY216GLU and
GLY250GLU.)

.0012
LONG QT SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, GLY314SER

Russell et al. (1996) reported a mutation resulting in a gly219-to-ser
substitution in 2 LQT1 (192500) families. (This variant used to be known
as GLY185SER and GLY219SER.) This mutation would be expected to encode a
potassium channel with altered conductance properties.

.0013
JERVELL AND LANGE-NIELSEN SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, 7-BP DEL/8-BP INS, NT1244

In 3 children with Jervell and Lange-Nielsen cardioauditory syndrome
(JLNS1; 220400) from 2 consanguineous families, Neyroud et al. (1997)
found homozygosity for a deletion-insertion mutation in the C-terminal
domain of the KVLQT1 gene. At nucleotide 1244, a deletion of 7 bp and an
insertion of 8 bp was found in affected individuals. The mutation
resulted in a frameshift from codon 415, leading to a premature stop
signal at codon 522 close to the end of the coding sequence, which is at
codon 547. Several other members of the 2 families were heterozygous for
the mutation. Both families originated from Kabylia, which suggested
founder effect.

.0014
JERVELL AND LANGE-NIELSEN SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, 1-BP INS, 282G

In a patient with Jervell and Lange-Nielson syndrome (220400), Splawski
et al. (1997) found homozygosity for a 1-bp insertion (G) after
nucleotide 282 of the KVLQT1 gene. The insertion caused a frameshift,
disrupting the coding sequence after the second putative
membrane-spanning domain of the KVLQT1 protein and leading to a
premature stop codon at nucleotide 564. The proband was born to
second-cousin parents. At 35 weeks' gestation, the obstetrician informed
the mother that the fetal heart rate had dropped to 70 to 80 beats per
minute. At 38 weeks, the heart rate continued to be slow, and slow heart
rate persisted after birth. One hour after delivery, at the time of the
first bottle feeding, the infant had cyanosis and hypotonia. A diagnosis
of LQT was made and treatment with propranolol was started. On the
eighth day, audiograms indicated bilateral sensory deafness. The family
members were not evaluated at that time. Seven months after the delivery
of the proband, the mother had a cardiac arrest and died when her alarm
clock sounded. She was exhausted and very anxious at the time.
Investigation of the family demonstrated an extensive involvement of
many members with typical heterozygous LQT. Linkage analysis showed that
the disorder mapped to the KVLQT1 region on 11p15.5.

.0015
LONG QT SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, ARG555CYS

In a study of 20 WRS (LQT1; 192500) families originating from France,
Donger et al. (1997) identified a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 1663
of the KVLQT1 gene causing a missense arg555-to-cys substitution in the
C-terminal domain. In 3 large kindreds, there was a total of 44 carriers
of this mutation. Only 5 living subjects experienced syncope and there
were 2 sudden deaths. Syncope or death occurred only in the presence of
drugs known to modify ventricular repolarization (terfenadine,
disopyramide, meflaquine, and diuretics). Carriers of the arg555-to-cys
mutation had only minor or no prolongation of the QT interval. Donger et
al. (1997) proposed that this allelic variant causes a forme fruste LQT1
phenotype.

.0016
JERVELL AND LANGE-NIELSEN SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, TRP305SER

In 2 consanguineous Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (JLNS1; 220400)
families, Neyroud et al. (1998) identified a trp305-to-ser mutation in
the pore region of KCNQ1 by PCR-SSCP analysis. In contrast to several
missense mutations found in the same region of the KCNQ1 gene in
heterozygous state in Ward-Romano syndrome patients, which are
associated with severe cardiac phenotypes, the heterozygous state of the
W305S mutation yielded an apparently normal phenotype. This is the same
phenomenon as that observed in a number of other situations: different
mutations in the same gene produce a phenotype that may be recessive or
dominant and the phenotype may be the same or different in the case of
the 2 modes of inheritance.

.0017
LONG QT SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, ALA300THR

Priori et al. (1998) described a 9-year-old boy with classic Romano-Ward
syndrome (LQT1; 192500) (syncope, prolonged QT interval, normal
audiogram) born to second cousins. Two brothers of the proband had died
suddenly, one at rest and the other while swimming. Sequence analysis in
the proband demonstrated a novel homozygous missense mutation, a G-to-A
transition resulting in an alanine-to-threonine amino acid substitution
at position 300 of the KVLQT1 protein. Both parents were heterozygous
for this mutation and had normal QT intervals. None of 100 control
chromosomes exhibited this mutation. Coexpression of the mutant KVLQT1
protein with minK (176261) in Xenopus oocytes demonstrated a mild
electrophysiologic effect on ion flux. The authors commented that this
mutation in the homozygous state caused Romano-Ward syndrome and not
Jervell and Lange-Nielson syndrome (220400), citing it as evidence for a
recessive variant of Romano-Ward syndrome.

.0018
LONG QT SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, 3-BP DEL, PHE339DEL

After identifying a 10-year-old boy with long QT syndrome (192500) after
a near-drowning that required defibrillation from torsade de pointes,
Ackerman et al. (1998) evaluated first-degree relatives and found a
4-generation family comprising 26 individuals with 4 additional
symptomatic and 8 asymptomatic members harboring an abnormally prolonged
QT interval. Linkage to the 11p15.5 region was found with a maximum lod
score of 3.36. A mutation search revealed a 3-bp deletion resulting in
an in-frame deletion of codon 339 for phenylalanine. Ackerman et al.
(1998) pointed out that the delF339 mutation is closely situated to
codon 341, which is the site of 2 common mutations, A341V (607542.0010)
and A341E (607542.0009).

.0019
LONG QT SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, 9-BP DEL, NT373

In a 19-year-old woman with LQT1 (192500) who had been asymptomatic but
who died after a near-drowning, Ackerman et al. (1999) demonstrated by
molecular tests at autopsy a 9-bp deletion involving nucleotides 373
through 381 of the KCNQ1 gene. The 9-bp deletion (GCCGCGCCC) resulted in
an in-frame deletion of 3 amino acids (alanine, alanine, and proline)
from position 71 through 73 in the cytoplasmic N-terminal region of the
KCNQ1 ion channel subunit. The woman's maternal grandfather, mother, and
18-year-old sister also had the 9-bp deletion. It appears that a
substantial number of unexplained drownings may have a basis in the long
QT syndrome. Although the mother had electrocardiographic changes of
long QT syndrome, the 18-year-old sister who was a carrier had equivocal
or normal electrocardiogram in the view of half a panel of expert
electrocardiographers. The resuscitation of the proband, although
ultimately unsuccessful because of the extended period of anoxia, did
allow electrocardiographic documentation of QT prolongation, which was a
notable finding, given the entirely asymptomatic personal and family
history.

LONG QT SYNDROME 1, RECESSIVE
KCNQ1, ARG518TER

Larsen et al. (1999) described a Swedish family in which the proband and
his brother suffered from severe Romano-Ward syndrome (LQT1; 192500)
associated with compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the KCNQ1
gene: R518X and A525T. The mutations were found to segregate as
heterozygotes in the maternal and paternal lineage, respectively. None
of the heterozygotes exhibited clinical long QT syndrome. No hearing
defects were found in the proband. The data strongly indicated that
compound heterozygosity for these 2 mutations is the cause of the
autosomal recessive form of RWS in this family. A recessive variant of
the Ward-Romano long QT syndrome (607542.0017) was suggested by Priori
et al. (1998) on the basis of a finding of homozygosity in a
consanguineous family. Larsen et al. (1999) suggested that 'sporadic
RWS' should be considered as potentially recessive RWS, and efforts made
to determine the molecular defects and identify carriers in the family,
since they may be at risk of dying suddenly from drug-induced LQTS.

JERVELL AND LANGE-NIELSEN SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, 2-BP DEL

Chen et al. (1999) reported a small Amish family in which 2 sibs
fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for JLNS (220400). Both were
homozygous for a novel 2-bp deletion in the S2 transmembrane domain of
KVLQT1. This mutation predicts a frameshift leading to protein
truncation. The protein product was predicted to be functionless due to
most transmembrane domains and the pore region of the KVLQT1 protein
having been deleted.

.0023
LONG QT SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, IVS5, -1

Murray et al. (1999) examined a French LQTS (192500) family and found a
novel G-to-C transversion at position 922 -1 in the splice acceptor site
of intron 5 of the KCNQ1 gene. The effect on splicing efficiency was not
determined.

.0024
LONG QT SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, CODON 344 SPLICE MUTATION

Murray et al. (1999) found linkage to KCNQ1 in a families with LQTS
(192500) and detected a G-to-C transversion at position 1032 within the
last codon of exon 6. The coded alanine was conserved. RT-PCR from fresh
blood samples from the proband and his affected mother demonstrated
transcripts lacking exons 6 and 7. Transcripts lacking exon 7 were also
found in lymphocyte DNA from a patient with this mutation and in normal
cardiac tissue from a patient without LQTS. The reading frame remained
intact, resulting in the deletion of the pore, or S6, domain. These
observations suggested that the G-to-C transversion in the exon 6/intron
7 consensus splice donor sequence affects splicing efficiency.

The authors also found a G-to-A transition at position 1032 in 2
unrelated French families. This had been independently reported in 5
other families by Li et al. (1998) and Kanters et al. (1998). Murray et
al. (1999) suggested that base position 1032 represented a mutation
hotspot within KCNQ1. The commonest site for mutation is codon 341, in
association with a methylated CpG dinucleotide.

.0025
LONG QT SYNDROME 1
KNCQ1, 1-BP INS

In affected individuals in a family with Romano-Ward syndrome (LQT1;
192500), Neyroud et al. (1999), detected insertion of a C at nucleotide
position 1893 in exon 15. This created a frameshift with a premature
stop codon 19 amino acids later, resulting in a largely intact protein.

.0026
JERVELL AND LANGE-NIELSEN SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, 20-BP DEL, NT1892

Neyroud et al. (1999) found that a male with Jervell and Lange-Nielsen
syndrome (JLNS1; 220400) was a compound heterozygote for a frameshift
mutation in exon 15 and another mutation that was not identified. The
frameshift, caused by a 20-bp deletion at nucleotide position 1892,
created a premature stop codon 13 amino acids later.

.0027
JERVELL AND LANGE-NIELSEN SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, THR587MET

Neyroud et al. (1999) reported that a male patient with Jervell
Lange-Nielsen syndrome (220400) was a compound heterozygote. One of the
mutations, a de novo missense C-to-T transition at base position 1760,
changed a threonine to a methionine within exon 14. The other mutation
was a maternally derived splice mutation in intron 1.

LONG QT SYNDROME 1
JERVELL AND LANGE-NIELSEN SYNDROME 1, INCLUDED
KCNQ1, GLY589ASP

Piippo et al. (2001) identified a novel missense mutation in Finns with
Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (220400) or long QT syndrome
(192500). The mutation, a glycine-to-aspartic acid substitution at codon
589 (G589D) in the C terminus of the KCNQ1 subunit, was identified in
homozygous state in 2 sibs with Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome and
in heterozygous state in 34 of 114 probands with Romano-Ward syndrome
and 282 family members. The mean rate-corrected QT intervals of the 316
heterozygous subjects and 423 noncarriers were 460 +/- 40 ms and 410 +/-
20 ms (p less than 0.001), respectively. Piippo et al. (2001) concluded
that the G589D mutation accounts for 30% of Finnish cases with long QT
syndrome and may be associated with both Romano-Ward and Jervell and
Lange-Nielsen phenotypes of the syndrome. They suggested that the
relative enrichment of this mutation most likely represents a founder
gene effect.

.0030
LONG QT SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, PRO117LEU

Schwartz et al. (2001) identified 2 Italian families with LQT1 (192500)
with the same heterozygous 350C-T transition in the KCNQ1 gene,
resulting in a pro117-to-leu substitution. In 1 family, an infant had
died of SIDS and was found postmortem to have a de novo mutation. In the
other family, several members had long QT syndrome. The mutation was not
found in 800 reference alleles of Italian origin.

.0031
LONG QT SYNDROME 1
LONG QT SYNDROME 1, ACQUIRED, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, INCLUDED
KCNQ1, ARG583CYS

In a patient with long QT syndrome (192500), Splawski et al. (2000)
identified heterozygosity for a 1747C-T transition in exon 15 of the
KCNQ1 gene, resulting in an arg583-to-cys (R583C) substitution.

In a patient who developed QT prolongation and torsade de pointes while
taking the drug dofetilide (see 192500), Yang et al. (2002) identified
heterozygosity for an R583C mutation in the KCNQ1 gene. The mutation was
not found in 228 controls. In vitro expression studies of the mutant
protein confirmed a significant reduction in potassium currents,
suggesting that the R583C mutation was responsible for the patient's
response to dofetilide.

.0032
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, FAMILIAL, 3
KCNQ1, SER140GLY

In a 4-generation family with autosomal dominant atrial fibrillation
(607554) from Shandong Province, China, Chen et al. (2003) identified an
A-to-G substitution at nucleotide 418 of the KCNQ1 gene leading to a
ser-to-gly substitution at codon 140 in all affected family members.
This mutation was not observed in normal individuals in the family with
1 exception, which Chen et al. (2003) ascribed to delayed manifestation
or incomplete penetrance. The mutation was absent in 188 healthy control
individuals. The serine at position 140 is well conserved among
different species and is located in the S1 transmembrane segment of
KCNQ1 in a position close to the extracellular surface of the plasma
membrane.

.0033
LONG QT SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, GLY269SER

Reardon et al. (1993) reported a family in which the proband had a
cardiac arrest at 4 years of age; she and her brother were then found to
have a QTc of 490 ms. The parents of the proband were first cousins and
there were hearing abnormalities reported in several family members. It
was uncertain whether the diagnosis should be Romano-Ward syndrome
(192500), which is dominant, or Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome
(220400), which is recessive. Murray et al. (2002) identified a
gly269-to-ser (G269S) mutation in the KCNQ1 gene in homozygous state in
the proband and her brother. Functional studies indicated that the
mutation had both recessive and dominant characteristics.

.0034
LONG QT SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, GLY269ASP

In 8 affected members of a family with a severe form of dominantly
inherited Romano-Ward syndrome (192500), 5 of whom had sudden deaths,
Donger et al. (1997) identified a gly269-to-asp (G269D) mutation in the
KCNQ1 gene.

.0035
LONG QT SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, VAL254MET AND VAL417MET

Wedekind et al. (2004) described a 4-generation family with long QT
syndrome (192500) in which 7 members were carriers of 2 amino acid
alterations in cis in the KCNQ1 gene: val254 to met (V254M) and val417
to met (V417M). Voltage clamp recordings of mutant KCNQ1 protein in
Xenopus oocytes showed that only the V254M mutation reduced the I(Ks)
current and that the effect of the V417M variant was negligible. The
family exhibited the complete clinical spectrum of the disease, from
asymptomatic patients to victims of sudden death before beta-blocker
therapy. Of 9 family members, 1 female died suddenly before treatment, 3
females of the second generation were asymptomatic, and 4 members of the
third and fourth generations were symptomatic. All mutation carriers
were treated with beta-blockers and remained asymptomatic for a
follow-up of up to 23 years.

.0036
LONG QT SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, 1-BP DEL/2-BP INS, NT533

In a 13-year-old girl with long QT syndrome (192500), Aizawa et al.
(2004) identified a C-to-GG substitution at nucleotide 533 in the KCNQ1
gene, causing a frameshift at alanine-178 and resulting in a truncated
protein with elimination of the S3 to S6 domains and the C terminus of
the KCNQ1 channel. Coexpression experiments in COS-7 cells showed that
mutant and wildtype KCNQ1 remained within the cytoplasm rather than
being distributed to the plasma membrane, suggesting that the truncated
mutant forms a heteromultimer with wildtype KCNQ1 and causes a
dominant-negative effect due to a trafficking defect.

.0037
SHORT QT SYNDROME 2
KCNQ1, VAL307LEU

In a 70-year-old man with short QT syndrome-2 (SQT2; 609621) who
survived an episode of ventricular fibrillation, Bellocq et al. (2004)
identified a 919G-C transversion in the KCNQ1 gene, resulting in a
val307-to-leu (V307L) substitution. Functional studies of the mutant
channel revealed that both a pronounced shift of the half-activation
potential and an acceleration of the activation kinetics led to a gain
of function in I(Ks).

.0038
LONG QT SYNDROME 1/2, DIGENIC
KCNQ1, 1-BP DEL, 562T

In a female infant with a family history of sudden death, who had
severe, continuous bradycardia in utero that was confirmed after birth
and a QTc of 485 ms (see 192500), Millat et al. (2006) identified
biallelic digenic mutations: a 1-bp deletion (562delT) in exon 2 of the
KCNQ1 gene, causing a frameshift at trp188, and an insertion in the
KCNH2 gene (2775insG; 152427.0020).

.0039
LONG QT SYNDROME 1/2, DIGENIC
KCNQ1, ARG243PRO

In a female infant with fetal and neonatal bradycardia and a QTc of 570
ms (see 192500), Millat et al. (2006) identified biallelic digenic
mutations: a 728G-C transversion in exon 4 of the KCNQ1 gene, resulting
in an arg243-to-pro (R243P) substitution, and a missense mutation in the
KCNH2 gene (R948C; 152427.0022).

.0040
LONG QT SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, VAL205MET

In 2 severely affected index cases with long QT syndrome (LQT1; 192500)
from a First Nations community in northern British Columbia (Gitxsan),
Arbour et al. (2008) identified a G-to-A transition in exon 4 of the
KCNQ1 gene that resulted in a val-to-met substitution at codon 205
(V205M). Identification of the mutation prompted the ascertainment of
122 relatives using community-based participatory research principles.
The 22 further mutation carriers identified had a significantly higher
mean corrected QT interval than noncarriers (465 +/- 28 milliseconds vs
434 +/- 26 milliseconds, P less than 0.0001); however, 30% of carriers
had a corrected QT interval below 440 milliseconds. In transfected mouse
Itk cells this mutation suppressed I(Ks) by causing a dramatic
depolarizing shift in activation voltage coupled with acceleration of
channel deactivation. Arbour et al. (2008) concluded that this mutation
likely conferred increased susceptibility to arrhythmias because of
decreased I(Ks) current. Even with a common mutation within a relatively
homogeneous population, clinical expression remains variable, supporting
the difficulty of definitive diagnosis without genetic testing.

610401	TITLE *610401 NETRIN 4; NTN4
;;BETA-NETRIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NTN4 belongs to a family of proteins related to laminins (see LAMA1,
150320) Koch et al. (2000).

CLONING

Koch et al. (2000) cloned mouse and human NTN4, which they designated
beta-netrin. The deduced 629-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal
domain similar to domain VI of laminin beta-chains, a central domain
similar to domain V of laminin beta-chains, and a C-terminal netrin C
domain. There are 2 N-glycosylation sites. Northern blot analysis
detected highest expression in kidney, spleen, mammary gland, aorta,
heart, ovary, prostate, and fetal spleen. Little to no expression was
detected in other tissues examined. RT-PCR of mouse tissues detected
high expression in kidney, heart, and ovary. Beta-netrin was also
expressed in brain and retina. Examination of specific mouse brain
regions detected highest expression in olfactory bulb.
Immunofluorescence localization detected beta-netrin in the basement
membranes of a variety of rat tissues, and it appeared to be produced by
both the epithelium and mesenchyme. Unlike other netrins (see NTN1,
601614), Ntn4 was not expressed during the development of mouse spinal
cord.

By RACE of total brain mRNA, Zhang et al. (2004) cloned a splice variant
of human netrin-4 that differed in the first coding exon. The deduced
591-amino acid protein lacks the N-terminal signal sequence found in
full-length beta-netrin. Northern blot analysis of specific human brain
regions detected a 3.2-kb transcript highly expressed in cerebral
cortex, but not in other regions examined. Netrin-4 was widely expressed
in adult rat brain.

By immunohistochemical analysis, Larrieu-Lahargue et al. (2010) found
that netrin-4 was expressed in dorsal aorta, anterior cardinal vein, and
lymphatic progenitor cells of mice at embryonic day 10.5. In adult mice,
netrin-4 was expressed in intestinal villi and crypts, lymph nodes, and
skin. Netrin-4 was also expressed in human breast tumor lymphatic and
blood vessels.

GENE FUNCTION

Koch et al. (2000) demonstrated that beta-netrin increased both the
neurite length and the number of neurites extending from explant
cultures of rat olfactory bulb.

Larrieu-Lahargue et al. (2010) stated that netrin-4 regulates
angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. They found that netrin-4 induced
lymphangiogenesis in lymphatic dermal human microvascular endothelial
cells (HMVEC-dLys). Netrin-4 treatment of HMVEC-dLys cells led to
dose-dependent increases in cell proliferation, cell adhesion,
chemotactic activity, and tube formation, and it reduced serum
deprivation-induced cell death. Overexpression of netrin-4 led to
enhanced metastasis of human breast cancer cells following injection in
nude mice. In addition, Netrin-4 induced lymphatic leakiness when
overexpressed in mice. Netrin-4-induced cell proliferation was
accompanied by phosphorylation of ERK1 (MAPK3; 601795)/ERK2 (MAPK1;
176948), AKT (see 164730), and S6 (RPS6; 180460) in a concentration- and
time-dependent manner. Netrin-4 activity was strongly inhibited by
inhibitors of both PI3 kinase (see 601232) and AKT. Netrin-4-induced
vascular permeability was accompanied by activation of the small GTPases
RHOA (ARHA; 165390) and RAC1 (602048), Src family kinases (see 190090),
and FAK (PTK2; 600758), as well as downregulation of tight junction
proteins (see 601009).

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhang et al. (2004) determined that the NTN4 gene contains 10 exons and
spans about 133 kb. The promoter region contains 2 TATA boxes, 7 CCAAT
sites, and binding sites for several transcription factors, including 8
MYT1 (600379), and 4 olfactory neuron-specific binding sites (see EBF,
164343).

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

By transmission electron microscopy after rotary shadowing, Koch et al.
(2000) found that the overall length of purified recombinant NTN4 is
about 17 nanometers. The molecules appeared to associate to form dimers
and to a lesser extent higher order assemblies. Dimerization occurred
through antiparallel linear alignment of the V and C domains.

MAPPING

Using FISH, Koch et al. (2000) mapped the NTN4 gene to chromosome
12q22-q23.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using mouse Nemo/Ikk-gamma (IKBKG; 300248) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid
screen, Leonardi et al. (2000) cloned CIKS from a human liver cDNA
library. The deduced 574-amino acid protein contains a C-terminal
leucine zipper. Northern blot analysis of multiple human tissues
indicated ubiquitous expression of a 2.5-kb transcript.

Li et al. (2000) cloned a cDNA encoding ACT1 from a cDNA library
constructed from embryonic kidney cells induced to display constitutive
activation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NFKB; see 164011). The deduced
574-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 60 kD and
contains a helix-loop-helix domain and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain.
The helix-loop-helix domain shares 35% identity with the
helix-loop-helix domain of upstream stimulatory factor-1 (USF1; 191523).
Northern blot analysis detected highest expression in thymus, kidney,
and placenta, moderate expression in heart, skeletal muscle, colon,
liver, lung, and small intestine, and low expression in brain, spleen,
and peripheral blood leukocytes.

By screening thymus, skeletal muscle, and fetal liver cDNA libraries,
Morelli et al. (2000) identified 3 isoforms of ACT1 that they designated
C6ORF4, C6ORF5, and C6ORF6. C6ORF4 encodes a deduced 575-amino acid
protein. C6ORF5 and C6ORF6 result from the skipping of exon 2 and are
differentiated by use of alternate polyadenylation signals, yielding
identical proteins of 566 amino acids. Northern blot analysis detected
5.0- and 2.5-kb transcripts in all tissues examined, with a weak 3.8-kb
transcript in heart, skeletal muscle, and pancreas.

GENE FUNCTION

Leonardi et al. (2000) verified the interaction between CIKS and
IKK-gamma by in vitro binding assays using recombinant proteins and by
coimmunoprecipitation of lysates of transfected HeLa cells or
untransfected Jurkat T-leukemic cells. IKK-alpha (CHUK; 600664) and
IKK-beta (IKBKB; 603258) also coimmunoprecipitated with CIKS. Using
truncation mutants, the authors localized the binding domain to the N
terminus of CIKS. HeLa cells transfected with increasing amounts of CIKS
showed dose-dependent activation of an Ig kappa-B luciferase reporter
plasmid, and the activation could be blocked by cotransfection with
IKK-gamma. Cotransfection of CIKS with kinase-deficient mutants of NIK
(MAP3K14; 604655), MEKK1 (MAP3K1: 600982), IKK-alpha, and IKK-beta
indicated that CIKS activates NFKB exclusively through an IKK-dependent
mechanism. Overexpressed CIKS also potently activated SAPK/JNK (MAPK8;
601158). Analysis of the binding activity of truncation mutants showed
that the C terminus of CIK is involved in SAPK/JNK activation, whereas
the N terminus is necessary and sufficient for kappa-B reporter
activation.

Using gel shift assays, Li et al. (2000) confirmed constitutive
activation of NFKB with transfection of ACT1 into human embryonic kidney
cells. They also found constitutive activation of JNK and IKK.
Disruption of the N-terminal helix-loop-helix domain of ACT1 completely
abolished the interaction between ACT1 and the IKK complex as well as
the activation of NFKB.

By mutation analysis, Pacifico et al. (2003) identified a sequence in
the 5-prime flanking region of human CIKS that was essential for basal
promoter activity in a canine kidney cell line. RT-PCR, Northern, and
Western blot analyses showed that various proinflammatory cytokines
upregulated CIKS expression in HeLa cells.

Using immunoprecipitation analysis, Qian et al. (2007) found that IL17
(603149) induced association of ACT1 with IL17RA (605461) in various
cell types. The ACT1-IL17RA interaction required the SEFIR domain of
IL17RA. Expression of Il17-dependent inflammation-related genes was
abolished in Act1-deficient mouse cells. Mice lacking Act1 had delayed
onset and lower severity of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, as
well as limited colitis. Qian et al. (2007) concluded that ACT1 is
essential for IL17-dependent signaling in autoimmune and inflammatory
disease.

GENE STRUCTURE

Morelli et al. (2000) determined that the ACT1 gene contains 10 exons
and spans more than 50 kb. They also identified C6UAS, which overlaps
exon 2 and is transcribed in the antisense orientation from the
complementary strand of C6ORF4. C6UAS has no apparent open reading
frame, but Morelli et al. (2000) provided experimental evidence that it
has a regulatory function and can behave as an antisense RNA in the
control of C6ORF4 translation.

Pacifico et al. (2003) mapped the CIKS transcription start site and
found that the 5-prime flanking region was TATA-less, but it had
initiator, GC, and CAAT boxes.

MAPPING

Morelli et al. (2000) identified ACT1 within an EST clone that maps to
chromosome 6q21.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Ellinghaus et al. (2010) and Huffmeier et al. (2010) independently
identified association of a coding single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP),
dbSNP rs33980500 (607043.0001), in the TRAF3IP2 gene with psoriasis
susceptibility (PSORS13; 614070).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PSORIASIS SUSCEPTIBILITY 13
TRAF3IP2, ASP19ASN (dbSNP rs33980500)

In a case-control genomewide association study of psoriasis
susceptibility (PSORS13; 614070), Ellinghaus et al. (2010) identified a
coding SNP, dbSNP rs33980500, in exon 2 of the TRAF3IP2 gene. A C-to-T
transition results in substitution of asn for asp at codon 19 (D19N).
This SNP was significantly associated with risk for psoriasis vulgaris
(P = 1.24 x 10(-16)) and psoriatic arthritis (P = 4.57 x 10(-12)).

In an independent case-control genomewide association study, Huffmeier
et al. (2010) found significant association of dbSNP rs33980500 with
psoriatic arthritis in a subset of cases and controls (P = 1.13 x
10(-20), OR = 1.95). Functional assays showed reducing binding of this
TRAF3IP2 variant to TRAF6 (602355), suggesting altered modulation of
immunoregulatory signals through altered TRAF interactions as a novel
and shared pathway for psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis vulgaris.
Huffmeier et al. (2010) referred to the amino acid change correlated
with this SNP as ASP10ASN.

609036	TITLE *609036 APBB1-INTERACTING PROTEIN; APBB1IP
;;RAP1-INTERACTING ADAPTOR MOLECULE; RIAM;;
RETINOIC ACID-RESPONSIVE PROLINE-RICH PROTEIN 1; RARP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By differential display to identify retinoic acid-induced transcripts in
a promyeloleukemic cell line, followed by 5-prime RACE of a thymus cDNA
library, Inagaki et al. (2003) cloned RARP1. The deduced 666-amino acid
protein contains an N-terminal proline-rich domain, a RAS
(190020)-associated domain, a PH domain, and a long C-terminal
proline-rich domain. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.6-kb transcript
in most tissues, with highest expression in thymus, spleen, liver, and
peripheral leukocytes. RNA dot blot analysis detected RARP1
preferentially expressed in thymus, spleen, lymph node, bone marrow, and
peripheral leukocytes. Western blot analysis showed that endogenous
promyeloleukemic cell RARP1 has an apparent molecular mass of 110 kD.
Immunostaining of transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells found RARP1
localized to the cytoplasm. Endogenous mouse Rarp1 was found in the
cytoplasm of megakaryocytes or their progenitor cells in bone marrow and
spleen.

Using a constitutively GTP-bound mutant RAP1 (RAP1A; 179520) as bait in
a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a Jurkat T-cell cDNA library, Lafuente et al.
(2004) cloned RIAM. The deduced 665-amino acid protein contains
predicted coiled-coil regions immediately N-terminal and C-terminal of
the RAS-associated domain, as well as several proline-rich regions,
including 6 profilin (176610)-binding motifs and 6 Enabled (ENA;
609061)/VASP (601703) homology-1 (EVH1) domain-binding motifs. RIAM
shares highest similarity with lamellipodin (RAPH1; 609035) and lower
similarity with GRB7 (601522), GRB10 (601523), and GRB14 (601524).
Database analysis identified a possible RIAM splice variant.

GENE FUNCTION

Using promoter-reporter gene assays, Inagaki et al. (2003) found that
RARP1 suppressed transcription from AP1 (165160) and SRE sites, but not
CRE sites, in all cell lines examined. The proline-rich regions of RARP1
suppressed AP1 transactivation.

Lafuente et al. (2004) found that RIAM interacted with profilin and
VASP, molecules that regulate actin dynamics, as well as with RAP1-GTP.
Overexpression of RIAM induced cell spreading and lamellipodia
formation, changes that require actin polymerization. Overexpression
also induced integrin (see 600065) activation and cell adhesion. In
contrast, RIAM knockdown cells had reduced content of polymerized actin.
Knockdown also displaced RAP1-GTP from the plasma membrane and abrogated
RAP1-induced adhesion. Lafuente et al. (2004) concluded that RIAM links
RAP1 to integrin activation and plays a role in regulating actin
dynamics.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Lafuente et al. (2004) mapped the RIAM
gene to chromosome 10p12.1.

614888	TITLE *614888 ALPHA- AND GAMMA-ADAPTIN-BINDING PROTEIN; AAGAB
;;p34
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

AP1 and AP2 are heterotetrameric complexes involved in clathrin-coated
vesicle trafficking that associate with the trans-Golgi network (TGN)
and plasma membrane, respectively. AAGAB, or p34, interacts with the
gamma-adaptin (AP1G1; 603533) subunit of AP1 and with the alpha-adaptin
(AP2A1; 601026) subunit of AP2 (Page et al., 1999).

CLONING

Using mouse gamma-adaptin in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a rat brain cDNA
library, Page et al. (1999) cloned Aagab, which they called p34. The
deduced protein contains 315 amino acids. Northern blot analysis
detected variable Aagab expression in all rat tissues examined.

By searching for genes in a region of chromosome 15 linked to punctate
palmoplantar keratoderma type I (PPKP1A; 148600), followed by PCR of a
human keratinocyte cDNA library, Giehl et al. (2012) cloned full-length
AAGAB. RT-PCR analysis detected AAGAB expression in hair follicle cells,
skin, HaCaT keratinocytes, and lymphocytes, with highest relative
expression in HaCaT cells. Database analysis suggested ubiquitous AAGAB
expression. Immunohistochemical analysis of normal palmoplantar skin
detected granular cytoplasmic AAGAB staining, particularly in the
stratum basale and the first suprabasal cell layers of the stratum
spinosum. Much weaker staining was detected in upper layers of the
stratum spinosum, where it localized only around nuclei in a few
keratinocytes. Dermal vessels were also AAGAB positive.

Independently, Pohler et al. (2012) cloned AAGAB by RT-PCR of HaCaT cell
total RNA. The deduced 315-amino acid protein contains a RAB (see
179508)-like GTPase domain in its N-terminal half and an adaptin-binding
domain in its C-terminal half. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed
AAGAB expression in all 48 human tissues examined, with highest
expression in rectum and thymus, followed by adrenal gland, spleen,
uterus, and vagina. Lowest expression was detected in mammary gland.
Fluorescence-tagged AAGAB was expressed in cytosol, but not in membrane
or clathrin-coated vesicle fractions, of HaCaT and HeLa cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Independently, Giehl et al. (2012) and Pohler et al. (2012) determined
that the AAGAB gene contains 10 exons. Pohler et al. (2012) reported
that the AAGAB gene spans 53.7 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Giehl et al. (2012) mapped the AAGAB gene
to chromosome 15q22.33-q23.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Page et al. (1999) found that rat p34
interacted with mouse gamma-adaptin and alpha-adaptin.

Using immunoprecipitation analysis and Western blot analysis, Pohler et
al. (2012) confirmed that p34 interacted with both AP1 and AP2
complexes. Knockdown of p34 did not alter the TNG or plasma membrane
localization of AP1 or AP2, respectively. In HaCaT cells, knockdown of
AAGAB increased EGFR (131550) mRNA levels and EGFR tyrosine
phosphorylation, indicative of active EGFR signaling. Pohler et al.
(2012) concluded that AAGAB may have a role in regulating EGFR turnover,
possibly via ATPase activity.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 families with type I punctate palmoplantar keratoderma (PPKP1;
148600), Giehl et al. (2012) identified 2 heterozygous nonsense
mutations in the AAGAB gene, R161X (614888.0001) and R124X
(614888.0002), that segregated fully with disease in the respective
families. Immunofluorescence analyses of skin from the palms and soles
of affected individuals revealed that the amount of granular staining in
keratinocytes was lower in the cytoplasm but higher around the nucleus
than in keratinocytes from controls, suggesting clumping of defective
keratin molecules.

In a collection of 18 PPKP1 kindreds from Scotland, Ireland, Japan, and
Tunisia, 11 of which had a family history consistent with autosomal
dominant inheritance, Pohler et al. (2012) identified heterozygous
mutations in the AAGAB gene (see, e.g., 614888.0001 and
614888.0003-614888.0006).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
KERATODERMA, PALMOPLANTAR, PUNCTATE TYPE IA
AAGAB, ARG161TER

In affected members of 2 Croatian families with type I punctate
palmoplantar keratoderma (PPKP1A; 148600), Giehl et al. (2012)
identified heterozygosity for a 481C-T transition in exon 5 of the AAGAB
gene, resulting in an arg161-to-ter (R161X) substitution. The mutation
was not found in unaffected family members. Genotyping of 21 individuals
from the 2 families revealed a 1.2-Mb common haplotype between markers
SNP15-67469128 and SNP15-68728632, indicating that the affected
individuals inherited the mutation by descent from a common ancestor.
Immunoblot analysis confirmed the predicted truncated size of
approximately 24 kD for R161X and showed a strong band, suggesting that
the protein is stable and not degraded. Allele-specific PCR
amplification yielded only a very small peak for the 481C-T allele.

In a 4-generation Scottish family with PPKP, Pohler et al. (2012)
identified heterozygosity for the R161X mutation, which segregated with
disease in the family and was not found in the dbSNP or 1000 Genomes
databases.

KERATODERMA, PALMOPLANTAR, PUNCTATE TYPE IA
AAGAB, ARG124TER

In affected members of a German family with type I punctate palmoplantar
keratoderma (PPKP1A; 148600), Giehl et al. (2012) identified
heterozygosity for a 370C-T transition in exon 4 of the AAGAB gene,
resulting in an arg124-to-ter (R124X) substitution. The mutation was not
found in unaffected family members. Immunoblot analysis confirmed the
predicted truncated size of approximately 18 kD for R124X but showed
only a faint band, suggesting that the corresponding mRNA is prone to
decay. Allele-specific PCR amplification yielded undetectable results
for the 370C-T allele, indicating loss of the protein.

reported by El Amri et al. (2010), Pohler et al. (2012) identified
heterozygosity for a 2-bp deletion (348_349delAG) in the AAGAB gene,
predicted to cause a frameshift within the GTPase domain resulting in a
premature termination codon (R116Sfs*1).

identified heterozygosity for a 1-bp deletion (473del) in the AAGAB
gene, predicted to cause a frameshift resulting in a premature
termination codon (Gly158Glufs*0).

607556	TITLE *607556 TWIST, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 2; TWIST2
;;DERMIS-EXPRESSED PROTEIN 1, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; DERMO1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using the yeast 2-hybrid system to screen for tissue-specific basic
helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins, which dimerize with the ubiquitous
protein E12 (147141) Li et al. (1995) cloned mouse Dermo1. Within its
bHLH region, the 160-amino acid Dermo1 protein shares extensive homology
with members of the Twist family of bHLH proteins (see TWIST; 601622),
which are expressed in embryonic mesoderm. During mouse embryogenesis,
Dermo1 showed an expression pattern similar to, but distinct from, that
of mouse Twist. Dermo1 was expressed at a low level in the sclerotome
and dermatome of the somites and in the limb buds at day 10.5 postcoitum
(pc), and it accumulated predominantly in the dermatome, prevertebrae,
and the derivatives of the branchial arches by day 13.5 pc. As
differentiation of prechondrial cells proceeded, Dermo1 expression
became restricted to the perichondrium. Expression of Dermo1 increased
continuously in the dermis through day 17.5 pc and was also detected in
the dermis of neonates, but it became downregulated in adult tissues.

By screening femur and rib cDNA libraries using mouse Twist as the
probe, Lee et al. (2000) cloned human DERMO1. The deduced DERMO1 protein
contains 160 amino acids and has a calculated molecular mass of 18 kD.
There are only 5 amino acid differences in the bHLH domains of DERMO1
and TWIST, and the N and C termini of these proteins also share
extensive homology. Human DERMO1 shares 99% amino acid identity with
mouse and rat Dermo1.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Perrin-Schmitt et al. (1997) mapped the
DERMO1 gene to chromosome 2q37.3.

GENE FUNCTION

Li et al. (1995) showed that the mouse Dermo1 protein bound the E-box
consensus sequence in the presence of E12, but transcriptional activity
was not detectable. Instead, Dermo1 repressed transcriptional activity
of myogenic bHLH proteins.

Lee et al. (2000) demonstrated that human DERMO1 caused changes similar
to TWIST in the osteogenic properties of osteoblastic cells, such as
morphology, bone marker gene expression, and biochemical response to
cytokines. However, DERMO1 expression also had unique effects in
regulating the mechanism of proliferation, on alkaline phosphatase
enzyme activity, and in temporal expression patterns.

Gong and Li (2002) generated a series of mouse Dermo1 mutants to
characterize the role of each domain in transcriptional repression. They
determined that the HLH and C-terminal domains, but not the N-terminal
and the basic regions of Dermo1, were essential for transcriptional
repression activity. They also found that Dermo1 directly associates
with Mef2 (see 600660) to repress its transactivation domain, and
histone deacetylation is involved in Dermo1-mediated gene repression.

Sosic et al. (2003) showed that Twist and Dermo1, which they called
Twist1 and Twist2, respectively, were induced by a cytokine signaling
pathway that required the dorsal-related protein Rela (164014), a member
of the nuclear factor kappa-B (NFKB; see 164011) family of transcription
factors, in mice. Twist1 and Twist2 repressed cytokine gene expression
through interaction with Rela. Mice homozygous for a Twist2 null allele
or doubly heterozygous for Twist1 and Twist2 alleles showed elevated
expression of proinflammatory cytokines, resulting in perinatal death
from cachexia. Sosic et al. (2003) concluded that there is an
evolutionarily conserved signaling circuit in which TWIST proteins
regulate cytokine signaling by establishing a negative feedback loop
that represses the NFKB-dependent cytokine pathway.

Bialek et al. (2004) determined that the Twist proteins transiently
inhibit Runx2 (600211) function during skeletal development in mice.
Twist1 and Twist2 were expressed in Runx2-expressing cells throughout
the skeleton early during development, and osteoblast-specific gene
expression occurred only after their expression decreased. Double
heterozygotes for Twist1 and Runx2 deletion showed none of the skull
abnormalities observed in Runx2 +/- mice, a Twist2 null background
rescued the clavicle phenotype of Runx2 +/- mice, and Twist1 or Twist2
deficiency led to premature osteoblast differentiation. The
antiosteogenic function of the Twist proteins was mediated by a domain
Bialek et al. (2004) called the Twist box, which interacted with the
Runx2 DNA-binding domain to inhibit its function.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 families with Setleis syndrome (FFDD3; 227260) mapping to
chromosome 2q37.3, Tukel et al. (2010) analyzed the candidate gene
TWIST2 and identified homozygous nonsense mutations that segregated with
disease in each family (607556.0001 and 607556.0002, respectively).

In 2 Mexican-Nahua sibs with the characteristic features of Setleis
syndrome, Cervantes-Barragan et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for a
1-bp deletion in the TWIST2 gene (607556.0003). Their parents and 2 sibs
were heterozygous for the mutation, and all 4 heterozygotes exhibited
distichiasis of the upper eyelids and partial absence of the lower
eyelashes. Cervantes-Barragan et al. (2011) concluded that heterozygotes
with TWIST2 mutations may have syndromic manifestations.

ANIMAL MODEL

Tukel et al. (2010) analyzed Twist2 knockout mice on a 129/C57 mixed
background and observed a facial phenotype similar to that of Setleis
syndrome patients, including thin skin and sparse hair with bilateral
pronounced alopecic areas between the ears and the eyes, resembling the
bitemporal forceps marks in humans. They also had absent lower
eyelashes, narrow snouts, protruding chins, short anterior-posterior
head diameters, and low-set dysmorphic ears. Histologically, the
bilateral alopecic areas in the Twist2 -/- mice were similar to the
defects in Setleis syndrome patients, including hypoplastic dermis and
absence of epidermal appendages and subcutaneous fat. The knockout mice
also had absent or hypoplastic Meibomian glands, as seen in Setleis
syndrome patients.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
FOCAL FACIAL DERMAL DYSPLASIA 3, SETLEIS TYPE
TWIST2, GLN119TER

In affected members from a large multigenerational Puerto Rican family
segregating autosomal recessive Setleis syndrome (FFDD3; 227260),
originally reported by Setleis et al. (1963), Tukel et al. (2010)
identified homozygosity for a 486C-T transition in the TWIST2 gene,
resulting in a gln119-to-ter (Q119X) substitution that was predicted to
truncate the C terminus after the bHLH motif. Quantitative PCR in
transfected HeLa cells revealed 3- to 4-fold decreased amounts of mRNA
compared to wildtype; immunoblot analysis showed that the mutant protein
was unstable, consistent with nonsense-mediated decay.

.0002
FOCAL FACIAL DERMAL DYSPLASIA 3, SETLEIS TYPE
TWIST2, GLN65TER

In affected members of a consanguineous Arab family with Setleis
syndrome (FFDD3; 227260), originally reported by Al-Gazali and
Al-Talabani (1996), Tukel et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for a
324C-T transition in the TWIST2 gene, resulting in a gln65-to-ter (Q65X)
substitution that was predicted to eliminate the bHLH region and the C
terminus. Quantitative PCR in transfected HeLa cells revealed 3- to
4-fold decreased amounts of mRNA compared to wildtype; immunoblot
analysis showed that the mutant protein was unstable, consistent with
nonsense-mediated decay.

In an 8-year-old girl and her 1-month-old brother with Setleis syndrome
(FFDD3; 227260), Cervantes-Barragan et al. (2011) identified
homozygosity for a 1-bp deletion (168delC) in the TWIST2 gene, causing a
frameshift resulting in premature termination. Their parents and 2 of
their sibs, who were heterozygous for the deletion, exhibited eyelash
manifestations consisting of upper lid distichiasis and partial absence
of the lower eyelashes.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

In eukaryotic cells, the nucleus is spatially and functionally separated
from the cytoplasm by the nuclear envelope. All molecular transport
across the nuclear envelope takes place exclusively through the nuclear
pore. Small molecules, such as ions and polypeptides smaller than
approximately 40 kD, pass freely through the nuclear pore, but larger
molecules require a carrier protein. The nuclear pore is formed by the
nuclear pore complex (NPC), an 8-fold symmetrical structure composed of
multiple copies of about 30 different proteins called nucleoporins. The
NUP98 gene encodes a NUP98-NUP96 precursor protein that is cleaved by
its own peptidase activity to produce 2 distinct nucleoporins, NUP98 and
NUP96. Alternative splicing also generates NUP98 transcripts that encode
NUP98, but not NUP96. NUP98 is a peripheral nucleoporin located at both
the cytoplasmic and nuclear sides of the central channel of the NPC. It
contains a characteristic gly-leu-phe-gly (GFLG) repeat region that
contributes to nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking, including mRNA export.
NUP98 also plays roles in gene expression, mitotic checkpoint, and
pathogenesis. NUP96 is a scaffold component of the NPC (review by
Iwamoto et al., 2010).

CLONING

Fontoura et al. (1999) identified NUP96 as a nucleoporin with a
predicted molecular mass of 96 kD. NUP96 is generated through an unusual
biogenesis pathway that involves synthesis of a 186-kD precursor
protein. Proteolytic cleavage of the precursor yields 2 nucleoporins:
NUP98 and NUP96. NUP96 is proteolytically cleaved in vivo. NUP96 is
localized to the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC at or near the
nucleoplasmic basket. The correct targeting of both NUP96 and NUP98 to
the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC was found to be dependent on
proteolytic cleavage, suggesting that the cleavage process may regulate
NPC assembly.

In their review, Iwamoto et al. (2010) noted that alternative splicing
produces 4 human NUP98 variants. Variants 1 and 4 are generated by
alternative splicing in exon 20 and are translated into the NUP98-NUP96
precursor protein. Variants 2 and 3 are generated without splicing in
exon 20 and are translated into NUP98 connected to a 57-amino acid
polypeptide tail that is removed from NUP98 by autocleavage. Variants 1
and 4 differ from one another due to alternative splicing in exon 29,
and variants 2 and 3 differ from one another due to alternative splicing
in exon 10.

MAPPING

Nakamura et al. (1996) mapped the NUP98 gene to 11p15 by analysis of a
panel of somatic cell hybrids and by pulsed field gel electrophoresis.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunogold electron microscopy, Radu et al. (1995) localized the
NUP98 protein to the nucleoplasmic side of the nuclear pore. Nakamura et
al. (1996) stated that ligand blot analysis suggested that NUP98
functions as a docking protein for cytosol-mediated docking of import
substrates. The docking function has been localized to the N-terminal
half of NUP98, the part of NUP98 that is retained in the NUP98/HOXA9
fusion (Radu et al., 1995).

Rosenblum and Blobel (1999) determined that no protease is involved in
the processing of the NUP98-NUP96 precursor, but the molecule
specifically cleaves itself between phe863 and ser864. The 2 fragments
then form a low-affinity complex.

Von Kobbe et al. (2000) demonstrated that NUP98 is a target of the
vesicular stomatitis virus M protein-mediated inhibition of mRNA nuclear
export.

Enninga et al. (2002) demonstrated that NUP98 and NUP96 are upregulated
by interferon. M protein-mediated inhibition of mRNA nuclear export was
reversed when cells were treated with interferon-gamma (IFNG; 147570) or
transfected with a cDNA encoding NUP98 and NUP96. Enninga et al. (2002)
concluded that increased NUP98 and NUP96 expression constitutes an
IFN-mediated mechanism that reverses M protein-mediated inhibition of
gene expression.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen, Enninga et al. (2003) determined that
SEC13L1 (600152) and an N-terminal region of NUP96 interact. By mutation
analysis, they determined that the WD repeat region of SEC13L1 and
residues 201 to 378 of NUP96 were required for the interaction. SEC13L1
did not bind NUP98. During mitosis, SEC13L1 was dispersed throughout the
cell, whereas a pool of NUP96 colocalized with the spindle apparatus.

Jeganathan et al. (2005) showed that in mitosis, timely destruction of
securin (604147) by the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) is regulated by
the nucleocytoplasmic transport factors Rae1 (603343) and Nup98. They
showed that combined haploinsufficiency for Rae1 and Nup98 in mice
results in premature separation of sister chromatids, severe aneuploidy,
and untimely degradation of securin. They also determined that Rae1 and
Nup98 form a complex with cadherin-1 (Cdh1; 192090)-activated APC,
APC(Cdh1), in early mitosis and specifically inhibit APC(Cdh1)-mediated
ubiquitination of securin. Dissociation of Rae1 and Nup98 from APC(Cdh1)
coincides with the release of the mitotic checkpoint protein BubR1
(602860) from Cdc20 (603618)-activated APC at the metaphase to anaphase
transition. Jeganathan et al. (2005) concluded that together, their
results suggest that Rae1 and Nup98 are temporal regulators of APC(Cdh1)
that maintain euploidy by preventing unscheduled degradation of securin.

Wang et al. (2009) reported that fusing an histone H3 lysine-4
trimethylation (H3K4me3)-binding PHD finger, such as the C-terminal PHD
finger of PHF23 (612910) or JARID1A (180202), to a common fusion partner
NUP98, as identified in human leukemias (Reader et al., 2007; van Zutven
et al., 2006), generated potent oncoproteins that arrested hematopoietic
differentiation and induced acute myeloid leukemia in murine models. In
these processes, a PHD finger that specifically recognizes H3K4me3/2
marks was essential for leukemogenesis. Mutations in PHD fingers that
abrogated H3K4me3 binding also abolished leukemic transformation.
NUP98-PHD fusion prevented the differentiation-associated removal of
H3K4me3 at many loci encoding lineage-specific transcription factors
such as Hox(s) (see 142950), Gata3 (131320), Meis1 (601739), Eya1
(601653), and Pbx1 (176310), and enforced their active gene
transcription in murine hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells.
Mechanistically, NUP98-PHD fusions act as 'chromatin boundary factors,'
dominating over polycomb-mediated gene silencing to 'lock'
developmentally critical loci into an active chromatin state (H3K4me3
with induced histone acetylation), a state that defined leukemia stem
cells. Wang et al. (2009) concluded that their studies represented the
first report that deregulation of the PHD finger, an effector of
specific histone modification, perturbs the epigenetic dynamics on
developmentally critical loci, leading to catastrophic cell fate
decision making and oncogenesis during mammalian development.

Rapid disassembly of the NPC during mitotic entry requires the master
mitotic kinase CDK1 (116940) and involves phosphorylation of many
nucleoporins. Laurell et al. (2011) identified phosphorylation of NUP98
as an early and crucial step during NPC disassembly in HeLa cells.
Recombinant NUP98 was hyperphosphorylated by PLK1 (602098), NEK6
(604884), and other NEK family members in vitro. Mass spectrometric
analysis revealed that NUP98 was phosphorylated on ser591 and ser822 by
NEK6 and on thr529, thr536, ser595, ser606, and thr653 by CDK1.
Phosphomimetic mutants of NUP98 localized to the cytoplasm instead of
NPCs. Conversely, phosphodeficient NUP98 mutants significantly delayed
NPC disassembly and loss of the nuclear envelope permeability barrier.
Laurell et al. (2011) concluded that NUP98 phosphorylation is critical
for NPC disassembly at the onset of mitosis.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Hodel et al. (2002) reported that the 3-dimensional structure of the
C-terminal domain of NUP98 revealed a novel protein fold, and thus a new
class of autocatalytic proteases. The structure further indicated that
the nucleoporin RNA-binding motif is unlikely to bind to RNA. The C
terminus was found to contain sequences that target NUP98 to the nuclear
pore complex. Noncovalent interactions between the C-terminal domain and
the cleaved peptide tail were visible and suggested a model for
cleavage-dependent targeting of NUP98 to the nuclear pore.

CYTOGENETICS

Lam and Aplan (2001) reviewed gene fusions involving NUP98. The NUP98
gene is fused to 1 of a considerable number of other genes in various
hematologic malignancies as a consequence of chromosomal translocation.
The common theme in all NUP98 chimeras is a transcript consisting of the
5-prime part of NUP98 and the 3-prime portion of the partner gene.
However, apart from the frequent fusion to different homeobox genes,
there is no apparent similarity among the other partners.

Nakamura et al. (1996) showed that in 3 patients with t(7;11), the
chromosome rearrangement created a genomic fusion between the HOXA9 gene
(142956) and the nucleoporin gene NUP98 on 11p15. Expression of Hoxa7
and Hoxa9 is activated by proviral integration in BXH2 murine myeloid
leukemias; this result, combined with the mapping of the HOXA cluster to
7p15, suggested that one of the HOXA genes may be involved in the human
t(7;11)(p15;p15) translocation found in some myeloid leukemia patients.
The translocation produced an invariant chimeric NUP98/HOXA9 transcript
containing the amino terminal half of NUP98 fused in-frame to HOXA9.
These studies identified HOXA9 as an important human myeloid leukemia
gene and suggested an important role for nucleoporins in human myeloid
leukemia, given that a second nucleoporin, NUP214 (114350), had also
been implicated in human myeloid leukemia. The 11p15 gene was identified
by exon trapping experiments.

Borrow et al. (1996) likewise identified the HOXA9 and NUP98 genes as
the parents of the fusion in t(7;11)(p15;p15) in acute myeloid leukemia
of the FABM2 and M4 types. Borrow et al. (1996) suggested that the
predicted NUP98/HOXA9 fusion protein may promote leukemogenesis through
inhibition of HOXA9-mediated terminal differentiation and/or aberrant
nucleocytoplasmic transport.

Hussey et al. (1999) identified the breakpoint genes of the
translocation t(4;11)(q21;p15) that occurred in a case of adult T-cell
acute lymphocytic leukemia (T-ALL). By analysis of somatic cell hybrids,
they showed that the chromosome 11 breakpoint occurred within the NUP98
gene, which is rearranged in several acute myeloid leukemia
translocations. Using 3-prime RACE, Hussey et al. (1999) identified the
fusion partner of NUP98 as RAP1GDS1 (179502). This was the first report
of the involvement of RAP1GDS1 in any malignancy. The product of the
RAP1GDS1 gene, usually referred to as smgGDS, has guanine nucleotide
exchange factor activity (Mizuno et al., 1991). In the fusion
transcript, which the authors referred to as NRG, the 5-prime end of the
NUP98 gene was joined in-frame to the coding region of the RAP1GDS1
gene. This joined the FG repeat-rich region of NUP98 to RAP1GDS1, which
largely consists of tandem armadillo repeats. Hussey et al. (1999) found
that the NRG fusion maintained the reading frame of RAP1GDS1. The
RAP1GDS1 sequence in NRG started at nucleotide 5 of the coding sequence.
The methionine and the first G of the codon for aspartic acid were lost.
However, the first aspartic acid was retained in the fusion protein,
because the last base of NUP98 exon B is a G. Hussey et al. (1999)
showed that this translocation is recurrent in T-ALL.

Nakamura et al. (1999) studied a translocation fusion gene in acute
myelogenous leukemia in which the promoter of the nucleoporin gene on
11p15 was fused to the DNA-binding domain of PRRX1 (167420).

Jaju et al. (1999) identified a recurrent cryptic translocation,
t(5;11)(q35;p15.5), associated with a deletion of the long arm of
chromosome 5 in de novo childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML; see
601626). Jaju et al. (2001) confirmed that the chromosome 11 breakpoint
gene is NUP98 and cloned the chromosome 5 fusion partner, NSD1 (606681).
Nucleotide 1552 of NUP98 was fused in-frame to nucleotide 3504 of NSD1.

Constitutive activation of tyrosine kinases, such as the BCR/ABL
(151410, 189980) fusion associated with t(9;22)(q34;q22), is a hallmark
of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; 608232) in humans. Expression of
BCR/ABL is both necessary and sufficient to cause a chronic
myeloproliferative syndrome in murine bone marrow transplantation
models, and depends absolutely on kinase activity. Progression of CML to
acute leukemia (blast crisis) in humans had been associated with
acquisition of secondary chromosomal translocations, including the
t(7;11)(p15;p15) resulting in the NUP98/HOXA9 fusion protein. Dash et
al. (2002) demonstrated that BCR/ABL cooperates with NUP98/HOXA9 to
cause blast crisis in the murine model. The phenotype depends on
expression of both BCR/ABL and NUP98/HOXA9, but tumors retain
sensitivity to the ABL inhibitor STI571 in vitro and in vivo. This
paradigm is applicable to other constitutively activated tyrosine
kinases such as TEL/PDGFRB (600618, 173410). The experiments of Dash et
al. (2002) documented cooperative effects between constitutively
activated tyrosine kinases, which confer proliferative and survival
properties to hematopoietic cells, with mutations that impair
differentiation, such as the NUP98/HOXA9 fusion, giving rise to the
acute myeloid leukemia phenotype. Furthermore, these data indicated that
despite acquisition of additional mutations, CML blast crisis cells
retain their dependence on BCR/ABL for proliferation and survival.

Rosati et al. (2002) reported a fusion between the NUP98 and NSD3
(607083) genes in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia associated with
t(8;11)(p11.2;p15). Hitherto, acute myeloid leukemia had been reported
with translocations creating chimeric genes between NUP98 and PMX1
(PRRX1), HOXD13 (142989), NSD1, HOXA9, LEDGF, DDX10 (601235), and TOP1
(126420). In patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and
t(4;11)(q21;p21), fusion of the NUP98 gene to the RAP1GDS1 gene had been
observed (Hussey et al., 1999).

Arai et al. (1997) showed that the recurrent chromosome abnormality
inv(11)(p15q22), which is associated with de novo and therapy-related
myeloid malignancies, results in fusion of the nucleoporin gene NUP98
with DDX10. In DDX10 and NUP98, the inv(11) breakpoints occurred within
2 introns of each gene, and the 2 genes merged in-frame to produce the
chimeric transcripts characteristic of this translocation. Although 2
reciprocal chimeric products, NUP98-DDX10 and DDX10-NUP98, were
predicted, only NUP98-DDX10 appeared to be implicated in tumorigenesis.
DDX10 is involved in ribosome assembly, and NUP98 is a nuclear pore
complex protein and a target of other chromosomal translocations found
in AML. Arai et al. (1997) predicted the NUP98-DDX10 fusion protein may
promote leukemogenesis through aberrant nucleoplasmic transport of mRNA
or alterations in ribosome assembly.

Ahuja et al. (1999) cloned and characterized a t(11;20)(p15;q11)
translocation from patients with therapy-related AML and therapy-related
myelodysplastic syndromes. They found that the breakpoint on 11p15
targets the NUP98 gene and results in the separation of the N-terminal
FXFG repeats from the RNA-binding domain located in the C terminus. The
breakpoint on 20q11 occurred within the TOP1 gene. As a result, a
chimeric mRNA encoding the NUP98 FXFG repeats fused to the body of TOP1.
Ahuja et al. (1999) concluded that NUP98 is a recurrent target in
therapy-related malignancies and that TOP1 is a previously unrecognized
target for chromosomal translocations.

Taketani et al. (2002) found that in the t(2;11)(q31;p15) translocation
2 alternatively spliced 5-prime NUP98 transcripts were fused in-frame to
the HOXD11 gene (142986). The NUP98/HOXD fusion genes encode similar
fusion proteins, suggesting that NUP98/HOXD11 and NUP98/HOXD13 fusion
proteins play a role in leukemogenesis through similar mechanisms.

The NUP98 gene had been found at the breakpoints of several distinct
chromosomal translocations in patients with both de novo and
therapy-related myelodysplastic syndromes and AML. Using combined
cytogenetic and molecular analyses, Ahuja et al. (2001) found
rearrangements of the NUP98 gene in the leukemic cells of 2 patients
with Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML during disease evolution.
Analysis of the t(7;11)(p15;p15) translocation from 1 of the patients
showed an in-frame NUP98/HOXA9 fusion. The fusion points were similar to
those previously reported from patients with myelodysplastic syndromes
or AML. The results indicated that the NUP98 gene is an additional,
albeit infrequent, genetic target during clonal evolution of CML.

Panagopoulos et al. (2003) reported a patient with de novo AML with a
t(11;12)(p15;q13) translocation resulting in a novel NUP98/HOXC13
(142976) fusion gene. FISH analyses showed a fusion signal on the
derivative chromosome 11, indicating a NUP98/HOXC chimera, whereas no
fusion was found on the derivative chromosome 12, suggesting that the
reciprocal fusion gene was deleted. Thus, NUP98/HOXC13 is of
pathogenetic importance in t(11;12)-positive AML.

Lahortiga et al. (2003) noted that the NUP98 gene had been reported to
be fused to 13 partner genes in hematologic malignancies with 11p15
translocations. Twelve of the 13 had been identified in patients with
myeloid neoplasias and only 1, RAP1GDS1, was fused with NUP98 in 5
patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Three of these
patients coexpressed T cell and myeloid markers, suggesting a specific
association of RAP1GDS1 fusion with a subset of T-ALL originated from an
early progenitor, which has a potential to express mature T-cell
antigens as well as myeloid markers. Lahortiga et al. (2003) described a
new NUP98 partner involved in a t(10;11)(q25;p15) in a patient with
acute biphenotypic leukemia, showing coexpression of mature T cell and
myeloid markers. The gene involved, located at 10q25, was identified as
adducin-3 (ADD3; 601568) using 3-prime RACE. ADD3 codes for the
ubiquitously expressed subunit gamma of the adducin protein and it seems
to play an important role in the skeletal organization of the cell
membrane. Both NUP98/ADD3 and ADD3/NUP98 fusion transcription were
expressed in the patient. Adducin shares with the product of RAP1GDS1,
and with all of the nonhomeobox NUP98 partners, the presence of a region
with significant probability of adopting a coiled-coil conformation.
This region is always retained in the fusion transcript with the NH2
terminus FG repeats of NUP98, suggesting an important role in the
mechanism of leukemogenesis.

Panagopoulos et al. (2006) reported the case of a fourth NUP98 chimera
in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia; a t(11;18)(p15;q12) resulted in
a novel NUP98 fusion. They found that exon 12 of NUP98 was fused
in-frame with exon 5 SETBP1. Nested PCR did not amplify the reciprocal
SETBP1/NUP98, suggesting that the NUP98/SETBP1 transcript is
pathogenetically important.

In a 42-year-old man with AML, Reader et al. (2007) identified a cryptic
translocation, t(11;17)(p15;p13), that resulted in in-frame fusion of
exon 13 of NUP98 to exon 4 of PHF23 (612910). The deduced chimeric
protein contains the N-terminal half of NUP98 fused to the C-terminal
functional domains of PHF23.

Such et al. (2011) identified a NUP98/RARG (180190) fusion gene
resulting from a t(11;12)(p15;p13) translocation in bone marrow cells
derived from a 35-year-old man with AML that had morphologic and
immunophenotypic features of the hypergranular subtype of acute
promyelocytic leukemia (APL; 612376). Sequence analysis determined that
NUP98 exon 12 was fused in-frame to RARG exon 4, predicted to encode an
862-residue protein with aberrant RARG receptor function. The patient
was treated with standard chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation;
response to ATRA was not assessed.

Tosi et al. (2005) identified a translocation, t(6;11)(q24.1;p15.5), in
a patient with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. RT-PCR and sequencing
revealed a transcript that contained exon 13 of NUP98 fused in-frame
with exon 2 of C6ORF80 (CCDC28A; 615353). The reciprocal fusion
transcript was not detected.

Petit et al. (2012) found that the NUP98-CCDC28A transcript contains
1,833 nucleotides of NUP98 fused in-frame to nucleotide 384 of CDCD28A.
The resultant 712-amino acid protein contains the N-terminal
transactivating GLFG repeats of NUP98 fused to CCDC28A beginning at
amino acid 77 and including its C-terminal coiled-coil domain. The
fusion protein was expressed in the nucleus following transfection of
primary mouse bone marrow cells. Immortalized mouse cells expressing
human NUP98-CCDC28A exhibited myeloblast morphology, proliferated in a
cytokine-independent manner, and caused fatal myeloproliferative
neoplasms in transplanted mice, with selective expansion of
granulocyte-macrophage progenitors in bone marrow.

ANIMAL MODEL

Iwasaki et al. (2005) generated transgenic mice in which the NUP98/HOXA9
fusion gene was specifically expressed in the myeloid lineage under the
control of the cathepsin G promoter. Approximately 20% of the transgenic
mice developed acute myeloid leukemia after a long latency period. When
NUP98/HOXA9 was introduced into the sensitive BXH2 mouse strain, it
promoted onset of retrovirus-induced myeloid leukemia. By examining
common retrovirus integration sites in these mice, Iwasaki et al. (2005)
found that Meis1 (601739), Dnalc4 (610565), Fcgr2b (604590), Fcrl
(606891), and Con1 cooperated with NUP98/HOXA9 in promoting the
development of myeloid leukemias. Using a transformation assay with
mouse NIH3T3 cells, Iwasaki et al. (2005) confirmed that these genes
cooperated with NUP98/HOXA9 in inducing the transformed phenotype,
although none alone were transforming.

614121	TITLE *614121 POLY(A) POLYMERASE-ASSOCIATED DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 4; PAPD4
;;GLD2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PAPD4 is a poly(A) polymerase (PAP; EC 2.7.7.19). Gld2, the C. elegans
ortholog of PAPD4, functions as a cytoplasmic PAP that regulates stem
cell fate and is required for stem cells to complete meiosis (Kwak et
al., 2004).

CLONING

By searching a human database for sequences similar to C. elegans Gld2,
followed by PCR of a human breast cancer cell line, Kwak et al. (2004)
cloned PAPD4, which they called GLD2. The deduced 484-amino acid protein
contains a catalytic domain within a central domain that shares higher
similarity with C. elegans cytosolic Gld2 than with canonic nuclear PAP
(PAPOLA; 605553). Kwak et al. (2004) also cloned mouse Gld2, which
encodes a deduced 484-amino acid protein that shares 93% identity with
human GLD2.

GENE FUNCTION

Kwak et al. (2004) stated that C. elegans Gld2 has little PAP activity
until it is directed to RNA via interaction with Gld3, an RNA-binding
protein. They showed that Gld2 tethered to RNA via Ms2, a nonnative
RNA-binding protein, efficiently catalyzed polyadenylation of reporter
mRNA. Similarly, mouse and human GLD2 catalyzed polyadenylation of
reporter mRNA to which they were tethered.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the PAPD4 gene to chromosome 5q14.1 based on an
alignment of the PAPD4 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK095818) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

601958	TITLE *601958 CALCIUM CHANNEL, VOLTAGE-DEPENDENT, BETA-3 SUBUNIT; CACNB3
;;CALCIUM CHANNEL, L TYPE, BETA-3 POLYPEPTIDE; CACNLB3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Collin et al. (1994) isolated the beta subunit of a human
voltage-dependent calcium channel gene from a 9-week-old human
total-embryo cDNA library. The gene encodes a 482-amino acid polypeptide
with a predicted mass of 54,571 kD. The gene, called H beta 3 by them,
was expressed mostly in brain, smooth muscle, and ovary.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yamada et al. (1995) described the exon-intron structure of the CACNLB3
gene, which spans approximately 8 kb and comprises 13 exons.

MAPPING

Collin et al. (1994) localized the CACNB3 gene to chromosome 12q13 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

To elucidate the molecular mechanism of the interaction between calcium
channel alpha-1 (see 601011) and beta subunits, Chen et al. (2004)
determined the crystal structures of the conserved core region of beta-3
(CACNB3), alone and in complex with the alpha-interaction domain (AID),
and of beta-4 (CACNB4; 601949) alone. The structures showed that the
beta subunit core contains 2 interacting domains: a Src homology 3 (SH3)
domain and a guanylate kinase domain. The AID binds to a hydrophobic
groove in the guanylate kinase domain through extensive interactions,
conferring extremely high affinity between alpha-1 and beta subunits.
The beta-interaction domain (BID) is essential both for the structural
integrity of and for bridging the SH3 and guanylate kinase domains, but
it does not participate directly in binding alpha-1.

NOMENCLATURE

Lory et al. (1997) provided a unified nomenclature for voltage-gated
calcium channel genes (see 114207), tabulated 12 of these genes, and
gave the map location of each.

ANIMAL MODEL

Murakami et al. (2002) noted that the accessory beta-3 subunits of
calcium channels are preferentially associated with the alpha-1b subunit
(CACNA1B; 601012) in neuronal N-type channels. By gene targeting, they
deleted the beta-3 subunit in mice and found that the mutation dampened
the processing of painful stimuli, specifically pain induced by chemical
inflammation. The ascending pain pathways of the spinal chord showed
altered N-type channel activity. In vitro binding studies and
pharmacologic manipulation indicated reduced expression of alpha-1b
subunits in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Murakami et al. (2002)
concluded that, since beta-3 controls the membrane targeting of alpha-1
subunits, the loss of beta-3 reduced the number of N-type calcium
channels present in the membranes of DRG neurons and dampened their
response to inflammatory stimuli.

Berggren et al. (2004) found that Cacnb3 -/- mice showed a more
efficient glucose homeostasis compared with wildtype mice due to
increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The increased insulin
secretion resulted from increased glucose-induced cytoplasmic free
Ca(2+) concentration oscillation frequency in Cacnb3 -/- beta cells, an
effect accounted for by enhanced formation of inositol
1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) and increased Ca(2+) mobilization from
intracellular stores. Berggren et al. (2004) concluded that CACNB3
negatively modulates InsP3-induced Ca(2+) release without affecting the
function of the voltage-gated L-type Ca(2+) channel.

605002	TITLE *605002 CORONIN 2B; CORO2B
;;CORONIN-LIKE PROTEIN C; CLIPINC
DESCRIPTION The Dictyostelium actin-binding protein coronin accumulates at the
leading edges of motile cells and in crown-shaped extensions on the
dorsal cell surface. Coronin is involved in cell motility, cytokinesis,
and phagocytosis, all of which depend on cytoskeletal rearrangement; see
CORO1A (605000).

By screening a frontal cortex cDNA library with a brain-enriched clone
showing similarity to Dictyostelium coronin, Nakamura et al. (1999)
isolated a full-length cDNA encoding CORO2B, which they called CLIPINC.
The predicted 475-amino acid CORO2B protein has an N-terminal domain
containing 5 WD repeats and a succeeding domain with a tendency to form
alpha helices. Northern blot analysis detected abundant expression of an
approximately 4.0-kb CORO2B transcript in brain, with moderate
expression in heart and ovary, and little or no expression in other
tissues tested. In contrast, CORO1A is primarily expressed in immune
system tissues, and CORO2A (602159) is predominantly expressed in colon,
prostate, and testis. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed Coro2a
expression in mouse cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, olfactory
bulb, and cerebellum, as well as in the inner nuclear layer of embryonic
retina and embryonic olfactory bulb. Cosedimentation analysis
demonstrated that CORO2B associates with F-actin. Immunofluorescence
analysis indicated that CORO2B accumulates at neurite tips, at focal
adhesions in association with VCL (193065), and along stress fibers.

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1999) mapped the CORO2B
gene, which they called KIAA0925, to chromosome 15.

300775	TITLE *300775 E74-LIKE FACTOR 4; ELF4
;;MYELOID ELF1-LIKE FACTOR; MEF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ELF4 is a member of the ETS (see 164720) gene family of transcription
factors (Aryee et al., 1998). ELF4 is involved in inducing cell cycle
arrest in naive CD8+ T cells (Yamada et al., 2009).

CLONING

Using nested, degenerate oligonucleotide PCR to obtain an ETS
domain-containing cDNA from megakaryocytes, followed by sequence
analysis and RACE, Miyazaki et al. (1996) obtained a full-length cDNA
encoding ELF4, which they termed MEF for myeloid ELF1 (189973)-like
factor. The predicted 663-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal
acidic region, an 85-amino acid ETS domain that is 94% identical to that
of ELF1, a central serine-threonine-rich region, and a proline-rich
region. Northern blot analysis revealed a major 4.2-kb transcript in
peripheral blood, ovary, spleen, thymus, liver, and colon as well as in
several cell lines of hematopoietic origin. Liver contained a minor
3.5-kb transcript, whereas a minor 6.2-kb transcript was found in the
other tissues. DNA binding and EMSA analysis indicated that MEF binds to
the ETS consensus GGA motif. Reporter assays showed that MEF, but not
ELF1, both binds and transactivates GMCSF (CSF2; 138960) and IL3
(147740) gene promoters. Miyazaki et al. (1996) concluded that MEF has
DNA binding properties similar to ELF1 but has additional
transactivating effects in hematopoietic cells.

Aryee et al. (1998) cloned and characterized ELF4, which they termed
ELFR for ELF1-related protein. Northern blot analysis revealed highest
expression in placenta.

ANIMAL MODEL

By BrdU and CFSE incorporation analysis, Yamada et al. (2009) showed
that activated naive, but not memory, Elf4 -/- CD8+ T cells proliferate
much more than Elf4+ cells. Proliferation in response to low antigen
concentrations was greater in Elf4 -/- CD8+ T cells than in those of
wildtype. The percentage of memory (CD44-high, 107269/CD122+, 146710)
CD8+ T cells increased and CD44-low cells decreased with age, and the
increase was accelerated in the absence of Elf4, accompanied by
splenomegaly, hyperplasia of the white pulp, increased CD4+ and CD8+
splenic T cells, and lymphocytic infiltration in the liver. The
Elf4-deficient mice accumulated memory cells expressing low levels of
the lymph node-homing marker CD62l (SELL; 153240) and its activator Klf2
(602016), as well as Ccr7 (600242), leading to a diversion of CD8+
memory cells from lymph nodes to the spleen. Mice lacking Elf4 also
accumulated a higher proportion and number of memory CD8+ T cells after
vaccination. Global gene expression, reporter, and ChIP analysis
determined that Klf4 (602253) is upregulated by Elf4, resulting in an
inhibition of CD8+ T cell proliferation. Yamada et al. (2009) concluded
that ELF4 regulates T cell homeostasis and the antigen-driven expansion
of polyclonal T cells by inducing KLF4 expression, and controls T cell
homing via KLF2. In turn, through KLF4 expression, ELF4 maintains the
expression of CD62L and CCR7 on memory T cells.

MAPPING

;;ERAP140
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By Far Western screening of a lymphoma cell cDNA library for estrogen
receptor-alpha (ESR1; 133430)-associated factors, Shao et al. (2002)
identified a novel cDNA, nuclear receptor coactivator-7. NCOA7 encodes a
942-amino acid protein, which the authors called ERAP140 (estrogen
receptor-associated protein of 140 kD). Northern blot analysis revealed
an approximately 5.5-kb transcript in all tumor lines examined,
including ESR-positive and ESR-negative breast cancer cell lines and
HeLa cells. Northern blot analysis of multiple human tissues revealed
highest expression in brain, with lower expression in mammary gland,
ovary, uterus, prostate, stomach, bladder, spinal cord, and pancreas. In
situ hybridization in mouse tissues demonstrated exclusive expression in
neurons in brain and significant expression in the cortex but not in the
medulla in kidney.

GENE FUNCTION

Using GST pull-down assays, Shao et al. (2002) found that NCOA7
demonstrated a low level of ligand-dependent constitutive binding to
ESR1, ESR2 (see 601663), THRB (190160), PPARG (601487), and RARA
(180240). Binding was further induced by the presence of ligands. NCOA7
did not bind to RXRA (180245) in the presence or absence of ligand.
NCOA7 can enhance the transcriptional activity of the nuclear receptors
with which it interacts.

Shao et al. (2002) found that NCOA7 differs from other nuclear receptor
coactivators in that it does not contain an LXXLL receptor-coactivator
interaction motif. Instead it contains a central domain between amino
acids 489 and 559 that mediates ESR1 binding. A leucine at position 523
and/or an isoleucine at position 524 appeared to be essential for the
interaction, and the binding surface appeared to be similar to that of
other coactivators.

GENE STRUCTURE

Shao et al. (2002) demonstrated that the NCOA7 gene contains 15 exons
and spans about 150 kb of genomic DNA.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Shao et al. (2002) mapped the NCOA7 gene to
chromosome 6q22.33.

;;tRNA PHOSPHOTRANSFERASE 1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database searching and screening of a human 18-week-old fetal brain
cDNA library, Hu et al. (2003) identified TRPT1, the homolog of S.
cerevisiae tRNA phosphotransferase-1 (TPT1). In yeast, TPT1 catalyzes
the removal of the 2-prime-phosphate from ligated tRNA during pre-tRNA
splicing and maturation. The deduced 253-amino acid human protein has a
predicted molecular mass of 27.8 kD and contains a DUF60/KptA domain. It
shares 83% and 40% sequence identity with the mouse and S. cerevisiae
homologs, respectively. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.0-kb
transcript with highest expression in skeletal muscle followed by heart,
intermediate expression in kidney and liver, low expression in thymus
and placenta, barely detectable expression in brain and colon, and no
expression in spleen, small intestine, lung, and peripheral blood
leukocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a plasmid shuffling experiment with an S. cerevisiae TPT1 mutant
strain, Hu et al. (2003) showed that TRPT1 functionally complements the
mutant phenotype.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hu et al. (2003) determined that the TRPT1 gene contains 8 exons and
spans approximately 2.5 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Hu et al. (2003) mapped the TRPT1 gene to
chromosome 11q13.

cAMP-REGULATED PHOSPHOPROTEIN, 16-KD, INCLUDED; ARPP16, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The 19-kD cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein plays a role in regulating
mitosis by inhibiting protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A; see 176915) (summary
by Gharbi-Ayachi et al., 2010).

CLONING

By screening striatal cDNA libraries with rodent and bovine probes,
Brene et al. (1994) obtained cDNAs encoding ARPP16, its splice variant,
ARPP19, and ARPP21 (605488). The deduced 96-amino acid ARPP16 protein is
99% identical to the rat and cow proteins. Compared with ARPP16, ARPP19
has 16 additional N-terminal amino acids. Northern blot analysis
detected a 1.7-kb transcript. In situ hybridization analysis revealed
expression of ARPP16/19, DARPP32, and ARPP21, with variable intensity,
in caudate nucleus, putamen, nucleus accumbens, cerebellar cortex, and
neocortex.

Heron et al. (1998) cloned ARPP19 and showed that it shares considerable
homology, except in the N-terminal region, with alpha-endosulfine (ENSA;
603061).

GENE FUNCTION

Mochida et al. (2010) identified alpha-endosulfine (ENSA; 603061) and
Arpp19 as phosphorylation-dependent inhibitors of protein phosphatase-2A
(PP2A)-B55-delta (PPP2R2D; 613992) and physiologic substrates of the
protein kinase Greatwall (MASTL; 608221).

Initiation and maintenance of mitosis require the inhibition of PP2A,
which dephosphorylates mitotic substrates. The protein kinase Greatwall
(Gwl) is required to maintain mitosis through PP2A inhibition.
Gharbi-Ayachi et al. (2010) described how Gwl activation results in PP2A
inhibition. They identified Arpp19 and Ensa as 2 substrates of Gwl that,
when phosphorylated by this kinase, associate with and inhibit PP2A,
thus promoting mitotic entry. Conversely, in the absence of Gwl
activity, Arpp19 and Ensa are dephosphorylated and lose their capacity
to bind and inhibit PP2A. Gharbi-Ayachi et al. (2010) stated that
although both proteins can inhibit PP2A, endogenous Arpp19, but not
Ensa, is responsible for PP2A inhibition and mitotic entry in Xenopus
egg extracts.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the ARPP19
gene to chromosome 15 (TMAP stSG3285).

607203	TITLE *607203 SALVADOR, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF; SAV1
;;SAV;;
WW DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN, 45-KD; WW45
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching an EST database using C. elegans and Drosophila WW
domain-containing protein sequences as bait, followed by 5-prime and
3-prime RACE using a human heart cDNA library, Valverde (2000) obtained
a full-length cDNA encoding WW45. The deduced 383-amino acid protein has
a predicted molecular mass of approximately 45 kD. It contains 2 WW
domains, a region rich in prolines and glutamines, and a coiled-coil
region, as well as a nuclear localization signal and 2 endoplasmic
reticulum retention signals. The mouse Ww45 cDNA has a different 3-prime
untranslated region and encodes a protein that shares 93% identity with
human WW45. Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses demonstrated that both
human and mouse WW45 transcripts (1.2 and 2.7 kb, respectively) are
ubiquitously expressed in adult tissues. In human, highest expression
was in pancreas, while in mouse, highest expression was in testis.
Northern blot analysis of whole mouse embryos showed that embryonic
expression of Ww45 first occurred at 7 days postcoitum. Expression
levels markedly decreased at day 11 and remained low at days 15 and 17,
suggesting that WW45 expression is developmentally regulated.
Accordingly, expression of human WW45 was found to be higher in fetal
heart than in adult heart.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Valverde (2000) mapped the WW45 gene to
chromosome 14q13-q23.

GENE FUNCTION

The mammalian core Hippo signaling components include Ste20 family
kinases Mst1 (604965) and Mst2 (605030), which are homologous to
Drosophila Hippo. To determine whether Hippo signaling controls
mammalian heart size, Heallen et al. (2011) inactivated Hippo pathway
components (e.g., SAV) in the developing mouse heart. Hippo-deficient
embryos had overgrown hearts with elevated cardiomyocyte proliferation.
Gene expression profiling and chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed
that Hippo signaling negatively regulates a subset of Wnt (see 606359)
target genes. Genetic interaction studies indicated that beta-catenin
(116806) heterozygosity suppressed the Hippo cardiomyocyte overgrowth
phenotype. Furthermore, the Hippo effector Yap (606608) interacts with
beta-catenin on Sox2 (184429) and Snai2 (602150) genes. Heallen et al.
(2011) concluded that their data uncovered a nuclear interaction between
Hippo and Wnt signaling that restricts cardiomyocyte proliferation and
controls heart size.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a screen for Drosophila mutations that result in tissue overgrowth,
Tapon et al. (2002) identified salvador (sav), a gene that promotes both
cell cycle exit and cell death. Elevated cyclin E (123837) and inhibitor
of apoptosis-1 (Diap1) levels were found in mutant cells, resulting in
delayed cell cycle exit and impaired apoptosis. Salvador contains 2 WW
domains and binds to the Warts (or Lats; see 603473) protein kinase.
Because WW45 is the human ortholog of salvador, Tapon et al. (2002)
sequenced the entire WW45 coding region in a panel of 52 tumor-derived
cell lines, representing a broad range of tissue types. One colon cancer
cell line, HCT15, had a heterozygous C-to-A mutation at nucleotide 554,
resulting in an asp185-to-ala substitution. This mutation was not
present in 185 population-based controls (370 chromosomes), indicating
that it is not a common polymorphism. The authors noted that HCT15
carries a mutation in the mismatch repair gene MSH6 (600678), which
appears to enhance the frequency of point mutations in other genes. Two
renal cancer cell lines, ACHN and 786-O, had deletions involving WW45.
The normal allele was not present in either cell line, indicating that
these cell lines were either homozygous or hemizygous for the deletion.
The WW45 transcript was undetectable by RT-PCR in both cell lines, and a
Southern blot using a probe derived from the 3-prime portion of the gene
demonstrated that this part of the gene was absent in both cell lines.
In cell line 786-O, PCR analysis of genomic DNA indicated that there was
a deletion of approximately 157 kb, with the 5-prime breakpoint between
exons 2 and 3 of WW45. The deletion in ACHN of approximately 138 kb
encompassed the entire gene. The common region of overlap between these
2 deletions was only 21 kb, containing exons 3 to 5 of WW45. No other
transcription units were identified within this 21 kb interval.

602327	TITLE *602327 PLECKSTRIN AND SEC7 DOMAINS-CONTAINING PROTEIN; PSD
;;TYL;;
EXCHANGE FACTOR FOR ARF6; EFA6;;
EFA6A
DESCRIPTION Perletti et al. (1997) identified a novel human gene on 10q24,
contiguous to the 3-prime end of the NFKB2 gene (164012) in a
tail-to-tail arrangement. They described a cDNA of 4,307 bp, isolated
from an adult human brain cDNA library, which contains an open reading
frame encoding a putative protein of 645 amino acids with a predicted
molecular weight of 71 kD. Database homology searches indicated that the
novel gene codes for a putative protein containing 2 discrete domains
with significant homology to the Sec7 and pleckstrin-homology (PH)
domains, respectively. They used the gene symbol PSD for
'pleckstrin-Sec7 domains.' Northern blot analysis of a panel of RNAs
from normal human tissues using the PSD cDNA as probe revealed the
presence of 3 different tissue-specific transcripts of approximately
4.3, 2.3, and 1.8 kb, the longest of which was expressed only in brain.
The data suggested that the PSD gene may encode a protein related to the
protein family containing both the Sec7 in the PH domains and thought to
be involved in signaling transduction processes. Other human proteins in
the same family include cytohesin-1 (Kolanus et al., 1996) and ARNO
(602488) (Chardin et al., 1996).

Derrien et al. (2002) reported that PSD, which they called EFA6A, is 63%
identical to EFA6B (PSD4; 614442) and contains a Sec7 domain adjacent to
a PH domain, followed by a C-terminal coiled-coil motif. Northern blot
analysis showed that EFA6A expression was largely restricted to brain,
with a smaller transcript expressed in small intestine, colon, and
ovary. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated punctate cell surface
expression of ARF6 (600464) and EFA6A, like EFA6B, in transfected baby
hamster kidney cells. Both EFA6 proteins also colocalized with F-actin
(see 102610).

GENE FUNCTION

Derrien et al. (2002) found that recombinant EFA6A stimulated nucleotide
exchange on myristoylated ARF6, with only low activity on ARF1 (103180).
The C-terminal region was involved in microvilli lengthening. Derrien et
al. (2002) concluded that EFA6 family guanine exchange factors are
modular proteins that work through the coordinated action of the
catalytic Sec7 domain to promote ARF6 activation, through the PH domain
to regulate association with specific subdomains of the plasma membrane,
and through the C-terminal region to control actin cytoskeletal
reorganization.

MAPPING

Gross (2012) mapped the PSD gene to chromosome 10q24.32 based on an
alignment of the PSD sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC142689) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;PSTPIP;;
CD2 ANTIGEN-BINDING PROTEIN 1; CD2BP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Spencer et al. (1997) identified mouse Pstpip1 as a binding protein of
the PEST-type protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs, e.g., PTP-PEST;
600079).

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a T-cell cDNA library with the
cytoplasmic tail of CD2 (186990) as bait, followed by probing a T-cell
cDNA library, Li et al. (1998) isolated cDNAs encoding splice variants
of human PSTPIP1, which they called CD2BP1. The full-length 417-amino
acid protein, which is 88% identical to mouse Pstpip1, contains a
coiled-coil region, which is 30% identical to yeast Cdc15, a PEST
region, and a C-terminal SH3 domain. Compared with full-length CD2BP1,
the shorter variant has a 19-amino acid deletion. Northern blot analysis
revealed expression of a 1.9-kb CD2BP1 transcript that was restricted to
hemopoietic tissues and cell lines, with expression upregulated in
activated T cells. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed expression of a
50-kD protein. Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated localization of
CD2BP1 at the interface of the cytosol and the plasma membrane and
colocalization with CD2 after ligand-induced clustering of surface CD2.

GENE FUNCTION

Binding analysis by Li et al. (1998) showed that the CD2BP1 SH3 domain
interacts with proline-rich segments of the CD2 cytoplasmic tail.
Functional analysis indicated a lack of kinase activity, but significant
tyrosine phosphatase activity.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen, Cong et al. (2000) identified mouse
Pstpip1 as an ABL (189980)-interacting protein. They showed that Pstpip1
was phosphorylated by ABL. Growth factor-induced Pstpip1 phosphorylation
was diminished in ABL null fibroblasts. Pstpip1 was able to bridge ABL
to the PEST-type PTPs. Several experiments suggested that the PEST-type
PTPs negatively regulate ABL activity: ABL was hyperphosphorylated in
PTP-PEST-deficient cells; disruption of the ABL-Pstpip1-PEST-type PTP
ternary complex by overexpression of mutants increased ABL
phosphotyrosine content; and PDGF (see 190040)-induced ABL kinase
activation was prolonged in PTP-PEST-deficient cells. The authors
concluded that dephosphorylation of ABL by PSTPIP1-directed PEST-type
PTPs represents a novel mechanism by which ABL activity is regulated.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay, Shoham et al. (2003) showed that human
PSTPIP1 and human pyrin (MEFV; 608107) interacted with each other and
colocalized within peripheral blood granulocytes and monocytes. Tyrosine
phosphorylation of PSTPIP1 markedly increased binding to pyrin.
Expression of 2 PSTPIP1 mutations (606347.0001 and 606347.0002)
associated with PAPA syndrome (604416) resulted in increased
PSTPIP1-pyrin binding. Shoham et al. (2003) suggested that sequestration
of pyrin in PAPA syndrome may prevent pyrin's normal immunoregulatory
functions, resulting in an excess of IL1-beta (147720) production, as
found in a patient with PAPA syndrome. The findings elucidated another
pathway involved in regulating inflammation, and linked PAPA syndrome
and familial Mediterranean fever (FMF; 249100) as disorders arising from
defects within the same pathway.

Yu et al. (2007) found that both pyrin and PSTPIP1 formed homotrimers,
and that the pyrin homotrimer was inactive due to masking of its PYD
motif by its B box. PSTPIP1 activated pyrin by binding to its B box and
unmasking the PYD, leading to interaction of the PYD with ASC (PYCARD;
606838), ASC dimerization, and recruitment and activation of caspase-1
(CASP1; 147678), a proinflammatory enzyme. Autoinflammatory PSTPIP1
mutants had higher binding affinities for the pyrin B box than did
wildtype PSTPIP1.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PSTPIP1
gene to 15q24-q25.1 (TMAP D15S1170).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Yeon et al. (2000) localized the genes for PAPA syndrome (604416) and
familial recurrent arthritis to chromosome 15q and suggested that they
are the same disorder. Wise et al. (2002) identified mutations in the
PSTPIP1 gene in 2 reported families with this disorder. E250Q
(606347.0001) or A230T (606347.0002) amino acid substitutions occurred
within a domain highly homologous to yeast cleavage furrow-associated
protein CDC15. PSTPIP1 and its murine ortholog are adaptor proteins
known to interact with PEST-type PTPs such as PTPN12 (600079). Yeast
2-hybrid assays demonstrated severely reduced binding between PTPN12 and
both the E250Q and A230T mutant proteins. Previous evidence supported
the integral role of PSTPIP1 and its interacting proteins in actin
reorganization during cytoskeletal-mediated events. The authors
hypothesized that the disease-causing mutations identified compromise
physiologic signaling necessary for the maintenance of a proper
inflammatory response.

In a 4-generation family with familial recurrent arthritis, which was
thought to be the same disorder as PAPA syndrome (604416), Wise et al.
(2002) identified a 964G-C transversion in the PSTPIP1 gene, which was
predicted to result in a glu250-to-gln (E250Q) substitution. Yeast
2-hybrid assays demonstrated severely reduced binding between PTPN12 and
the mutant protein.

In affected sibs with PAPA syndrome (604416), Wise et al. (2002)

to result in an ala230-to-thr (A230T) substitution. Yeast 2-hybrid
assays demonstrated severely reduced binding between PTPN12 and the
mutant protein.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NFKB1 (164011) or NFKB2 (164012) is bound to REL (164910), RELA, or RELB
(604758) to form the NFKB complex. The p50 (NFKB1)/p65 (RELA)
heterodimer is the most abundant form of NFKB. The NFKB complex is
inhibited by I-kappa-B proteins (NFKBIA, 164008 or NFKBIB, 604495),
which inactivate NFKB by trapping it in the cytoplasm. Phosphorylation
of serine residues on the I-kappa-B proteins by kinases (IKBKA, 600664,
or IKBKB, 603258) marks them for destruction via the ubiquitination
pathway, thereby allowing activation of the NFKB complex. Activated NFKB
complex translocates into the nucleus and binds DNA at kappa-B-binding
motifs such as 5-prime GGGRNNYYCC 3-prime or 5-prime HGGARNYYCC 3-prime
(where H is A, C, or T; R is an A or G purine; and Y is a C or T
pyrimidine).

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Zhong et al. (1998) reported that the transcriptional activity of
NF-kappa-B is stimulated upon phosphorylation of its p65 subunit on
serine-276 by protein kinase A (PKA). The transcriptional coactivator
CBP (600140)/p300 (602700) associates with NF-kappa-B p65 through 2
sites, an N-terminal domain that interacts with the C-terminal region of
unphosphorylated p65, and a second domain that only interacts with p65
phosphorylated on serine-276. Phosphorylation by PKA both weakens the
interaction between the N- and C-terminal regions of p65 and creates an
additional site for interaction with CBP/p300. Therefore, PKA regulates
the transcriptional activity of NF-kappa-B by modulating its interaction
with CBP/p300.

Jacobs and Harrison (1998) and Huxford et al. (1998) determined the
structure of the NFKBIA ankyrin repeat domain, bound to a partially
truncated NFKB heterodimer (p50/p65), by x-ray crystallography at 2.7-
and 2.3-angstrom resolution, respectively. It shows a stack of 6 NFKBIA
ankyrin repeats facing the C-terminal domains of the NFKB rel homology
regions. Contacts occur in discontinuous patches, suggesting a
combinatorial quality for ankyrin repeat specificity. The first 2
repeats cover an alpha helically ordered segment containing the p65
nuclear localization signal. The position of the sixth ankyrin repeat
shows that full-length NFKBIA will occlude the NFKB DNA-binding cleft.
The orientation of NFKBIA in the complex places its N- and C-terminal
regions in appropriate locations for their known regulatory functions.
Baeuerle (1998) discussed the model of interactions between NFKBIA and
NFKB.

GENE FUNCTION

Chen et al. (2001) noted that the events involved in the release of NFKB
from IKBA are relatively well understood, but the regulation of nuclear
forms of NFKB that ensure transient transcriptional responses are less
well delineated. Luciferase reporter analysis showed that treatment with
trichostatin A (TSA), an inhibitor of multiple histone deacetylases
(e.g., HDAC1; 601241), results in prolonged intranuclear expression of
RELA after TNFA (191160) stimulation. Expression of HDAC3 (605166), but
not other HDACs, was found to inhibit kappa-B luciferase activity and
abolish the acetylation of RELA, which is mediated by p300 or CBP but
not PCAF (602303), in the absence of TSA. Coimmunoprecipitation and
mammalian 2-hybrid analyses indicated that RELA and HDAC3 associate
through their N termini. Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that
coexpression of RELA with HDAC3, but not with HDAC1, results in
cytoplasmic instead of nuclear localization of RELA, and this is
dependent on the expression of exportin-1 (XPO1; 602559). Coexpression
of HDAC3 in the presence of p300 allowed binding of RELA to IKBA,
suggesting that deacetylation of RELA stimulates IKBA binding and the
termination of the NFKB transcriptional response. Fluorescence
microscopy showed that in the presence of HDAC3, RELA expression shifts
to the cytoplasm in wildtype murine embryo fibroblasts but not in
fibroblasts obtained from Ikba -/- mice, indicating that IKBA is
required for the nuclear export of deacetylated RELA. Chen et al. (2001)
concluded that RELA is a nonhistone substrate of HDAC3 and that
IKBA-dependent nuclear export of the HDAC3-deacetylated RELA replenishes
the depleted cytoplasmic pool of latent NFKB-IKBA complexes for
subsequent NFKB responses.

Zhong et al. (2002) demonstrated that transcriptionally inactive nuclear
NFKB in resting cells consists of homodimers of either p65 or p50
complexed with the histone deacetylase HDAC1. Only the p50-HDAC1
complexes bound to DNA and suppressed NFKB-dependent gene expression in
unstimulated cells. Appropriate stimulation caused nuclear localization
of NFKB complexes containing phosphorylated p65 that associated with CBP
and displaced the p50-HDAC1 complexes. These results demonstrated that
phosphorylation of p65 determines whether it associates with either CBP
or HDAC1, ensuring that only p65 entering the nucleus from cytoplasmic
NFKB-IKB complexes can activate transcription.

Because therapeutics inhibiting RAS and NFKB pathways are used to treat
human cancer, experiments assessing the effects of altering these
regulators have been performed in mice. The medical relevance of murine
studies is limited, however, by differences between mouse and human
skin, and by the greater ease of transforming murine cells. To study RAS
and NFKB in a setting more relevant to human tumorigenesis, Dajee et al.
(2003) expressed the active HRAS gly12-to-val mutation (190020.0001),
NFKB p65, and a stable NFKB repressor mutant of IKBA (164008) in human
skin tissue. Although implicated in promoting features of neoplasia in
other settings, coexpression of oncogenic RAS with NFKB subunits failed
to support proliferation. Coexpression of RAS and IKBA produced large
neoplasms with deep invasion through fat into underlying muscle and
fascia, similar to human squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), in 3 weeks.
Dajee et al. (2003) demonstrated that growth arrest triggered by
oncogenic RAS can be bypassed by IKBA-mediated blockade of NFKB and that
RAS opposed the increased susceptibility to apoptosis caused by NFKB
blockade, generating malignant human epidermal tissue resembling SCC.

Smahi et al. (2002) reviewed the NFKB signaling pathway, with emphasis
on its dysregulation in the genetic disorders incontinentia pigmenti
(308300), hypohidrotic/anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (see 305100),
anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immunodeficiency (EDA-ID; 300291),
and EDA-ID with osteopetrosis and lymphoedema (300301).

In rat sciatic nerves, Nickols et al. (2003) found that expression of
the activated p65 subunit of NFKB was high in the nuclei of
premyelinating Schwann cells and then progressively declined until it
was nearly absent in adults. NFKB expression preceded and was necessary
for the upregulation of the transcription factor Oct6 (POU3F1; 602479),
which has been shown to play a role in the differentiation of promyelin
cells to myelinating cells. The authors concluded that NFKB is upstream
of Oct6 induction and is also required for the formation of peripheral
myelin.

Using cDNA microarray and in vitro analyses, Kelly et al. (2004) found
that the commensal bacterium Bacteroides thetaioatomicron attenuated
inflammatory responses, notably IL8 (146930) production, in intestinal
cell lines exposed to pathogenic Salmonella enteritidis and a number of
other inflammatory mediators. The commensal organism induced CRM1
(XPO1)-independent nuclear export, rather than import only, of the NFKB
subunit RELA, with an eventual predominance of RELA cytoplasmic
distribution after the peak of RELA induction by IL1A (147760) and IL1B
(147720). RELA nucleocytoplasmic redistribution coincided with export of
PPARG (601487), and immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that
PPARG-RELA association was dependent on the PPARG C-terminal
ligand-binding domain. Kelly et al. (2004) concluded that at least some
commensal bacteria contribute to immune homeostasis through an
antiinflammatory mechanism involving PPARG and NFKB.

Mazzeo et al. (2004) found positive immunostaining for activated p65
NFKB in nerve biopsies from 5 patients with chronic inflammatory
demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP; see 139393), 5 with familial
amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP; see 176300), and 3 with vasculitis.
Mild to moderate staining was detected in 2 to 15% of epineurial and
endoneurial vessel walls, 5 to 10% of outer layers of myelin sheaths,
and in amyloid deposits of FAP. There was an association between NFKB
staining and localization of the terminal membrane attack complex (MAC)
of the complement system. No staining was seen in 3 control specimens.
Mazzeo et al. (2004) suggested a role for NFKB in inflammatory
conditions of the peripheral nervous system.

Signaling by the transcription factor NFKB involves its release from IKB
in the cytosol, followed by translocation into the nucleus. NFKB
regulation of I-kappa-B-alpha transcription represents a delayed
negative feedback loop that drives oscillations in NFKB translocation.
Nelson et al. (2004) reported that single-cell time-lapse imaging and
computational modeling of NFKB localization showed asynchronous
oscillations following cell stimulation that decreased in frequency with
increased I-kappa-B-alpha transcription. Transcription of target genes
depended on oscillation persistence, involving cycles of NFKB
phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Nelson et al. (2004) concluded
that the functional consequences of NFKB signaling may thus depend on
number, period, and amplitude of oscillations.

Barken et al. (2005) commented on the paper by Nelson et al. (2004),
suggesting that altering expression levels of fluorescently-tagged
signal proteins can severely affect the dynamic behavior of the
signaling pathway under study and cautioning against equating the
signaling behavior of genetically engineered cells with that of normal
cells. In response to the comment by Barken et al. (2005), Nelson et al.
(2005) stated that their experimental data showed no correlation between
NF-kappa-B (RelA) expression level and oscillation dynamics. Nelson et
al. (2005) showed that a small change to the computational model used by
Barken et al. (2005) to generate their theoretical data reduced the
apparent discrepancies. Cell system differences and possible
compensatory changes to normal signaling in their genetically knockout
cells may explain differences between the 2 studies.

Liu et al. (2006) showed that preexisting nuclear RELA positively
regulates ultraviolet (UV) irradiation-induced activation of JNK (MAPK8;
601158). In UV-irradiated mouse fibroblasts, they found that Pkc-delta
(176977) was required for Rela to activate Jnk, thereby contributing to
UV-induced apoptosis.

By genomewide mapping of RELA-bound loci in lipopolysaccharide
(LPS)-stimulated monocytes, together with global gene expression
profiling, Lim et al. (2007) identified an overrepresentation of the
E2F1 (189971)-binding motif among RELA-bound loci associated with NFKB
target genes. Knockdown of endogenous E2F1 impaired the LPS inducibility
of the proinflammatory cytokines CCL3 (182283), IL23A (605580), TNF, and
IL1B. Sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation and coimmunoprecipitation
analysis showed that E2F1 existed as a complex with p50/RELA in
LPS-stimulated monocytes. Lim et al. (2007) concluded that NFKB recruits
E2F1 to positively regulate a spectrum of NFKB target genes.

Using knockdown, transfection, and protein interaction experiments with
human cell lines and mouse embryonic fibroblasts, Mao et al. (2009)
showed that a complex of COMMD1 (607238), GCN5 (KAT2A; 602301), and CUL2
(603135) mediated ubiquitination of RELA, an event required for proper
termination of RELA-promoter interactions. Chromatin immunoprecipitation
experiments showed that COMMD1 or GCN5 deficiency prolonged promoter
occupancy by RELA. IKK-dependent phosphorylation of RELA on ser468
enhanced binding of GCN5 to RELA and RELA ubiquitination.

GENE STRUCTURE

Deloukas and van Loon (1993) determined the complete genomic structure
of the human gene and a partial structure of the mouse gene encoding
p65. The human gene consists of 10 exons and spans about 8.1 kb of DNA.
A surprisingly high degree of conservation of intronic sequences was
observed between the species. Variants generated by alternative splicing
of intron 6 were observed in both species and the existence of another
as yet unknown splice variant of p65 was predicted.

MAPPING

Using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), Mathew et al. (1993)
demonstrated that the NFKB3 gene is located on 11q13. Using a YAC
containing the entire NFKB3 gene and FISH, Deloukas et al. (1994) found
2 sites of hybridization, 11q12 and Xp11.4, for sequences present in the
YAC. The NFKB3 gene was assigned to 11q12 by PCR analysis of a panel of
relevant hybrid cell lines.

ANIMAL MODEL

Beg et al. (1995) made a transgenic knockout mouse line for RelA and
showed that loss of the protein led to embryonic lethality at 15-16 days
of gestation as a result of massive degeneration of the liver due to
apoptosis.

Neurath et al. (1996) reported direct evidence for the involvement of
p65 in chronic intestinal inflammation induced in mice and suggested a
potential molecular therapeutic approach to the treatment of patients
with Crohn disease (see 266600) using p65 antisense oligonucleotides.

In order to study the effect of Rela deficiency on mouse skin, Zhang et
al. (2004) harvested Rela -/- embryo skin prior to embryonic lethality
around embryonic day 15.5 and grafted it onto immune-deficient mice.
Histologic examination revealed that Rela deficiency led to epidermal
hyperplasia and moderately increased cell size. The granular and
cornified layers appeared normal, and there was no inflammatory cell
infiltration. Rela -/- keratinocytes exhibited enhanced proliferation in
culture. Tnfr1 (191190)-dependent Jnk (601158) activation occurred in
Rela -/- epidermis, and Jnk inhibition abolished hyperproliferation due
to Rela deficiency. Furthermore, the hyperproliferation of
Rela-deficient skin was completely reversed in Rela-Tnfr1
double-knockout skin. Zhang et al. (2004) concluded that RELA
antagonizes TNFR1-JNK proliferative signals in epidermis and plays a
nonredundant role in restraining epidermal growth.

Gugasyan et al. (2004) found that mutant mice lacking both c-rel and
RelA displayed multiple epidermal defects, including thin epidermis and
failure to form tylotrich hair. Although mutant keratinocytes underwent
terminal differentiation, mutant basal keratinocytes were abnormally
small, showed growth delay, and failed to form colonies in culture. The
findings indicated that c-rel and RelA regulate skin development in a
redundant manner and that both are required for normal epidermal
development in mice.

ABI1/MLL FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Taki et al. (1998) identified the ABI1 gene as the fusion partner with
MLL (159555) in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and a
t(10;11)(p11.2;q23) ABI1 is a human homolog of mouse Abl-interactor-1
(Abi1). The ABI1 protein exhibited sequence similarity to protein of
homeotic genes, contained several polyproline stretches, and included a
Src homology-3 (SH3) domain at the C terminus that is required for
binding of mouse Abi1 protein to Abl proteins. Three types of the ABI1
gene were expressed in normal peripheral blood. The MLL-ABI1 fusion
transcript in this patient was formed by an alternatively spliced ABI1.
In-frame MLL-ABI1 fusion transcripts combined the MLL AT-hook motifs and
DNA methyltransferase homology region with the homeodomain homologous
region, polyproline stretches, and SH3 domain of the alternatively
spliced transcript of ABI1. The results suggested that ABI1 plays a role
in the leukemogenesis by translocating to MLL.

Taki et al. (1998) noted the similarity between the protein they
described and the E3B1 protein described by Biesova et al. (1997), which
was also isolated as a human homolog of mouse Abi1.

MAPPING

Taki et al. (1998) identified the ABI1 gene on chromosome 10p11.2 as the
fusion partner of MLL in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia.

GENE FUNCTION

Scita et al. (1999) demonstrated that EPS8 (600206) and E3B1/ABI1
participate in the transduction of signals from Ras (190020) to Rac (see
602048) by regulating Rac-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor
(GEF) activities. Scita et al. (1999) also showed that EPS8, E3B1, and
SOS1 (182530) form a tricomplex in vivo that exhibits Rac-specific GEF
activity in vitro. Scita et al. (1999) proposed a model in which EPS8
mediates the transfer of signals between Ras and Rac by forming a
complex with E3B1 and SOS1.

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; 131550) signaling involves small
GTPases of the Rho family, and EGFR trafficking involves small GTPases
of the Rab family. Lanzetti et al. (2000) reported that the EPS8 protein
connects these signaling pathways. EPS8 is a substrate of EGFR that is
held in a complex with SOS1 by the adaptor protein E3B1, thereby
mediating activation of RAC. Through its SH3 domain, EPS8 interacts with
RNTRE (605405). Lanzetti et al. (2000) showed that RNTRE is a RAB5
(179512) GTPase-activating protein whose activity is regulated by EGFR.
By entering in a complex with EPS8, RNTRE acts on RAB5 and inhibits
internalization of the EGFR. Furthermore, RNTRE diverts EPS8 from its
RAC-activating function, resulting in the attenuation of RAC signaling.
Thus, depending on its state of association with E3B1 or RNTRE, EPS8
participates in both EGFR signaling through RAC and EGFR trafficking
through RAB5.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay, Tani et al. (2003) found that human ABI1
bound mouse Mena (ENAH; 609061). Binding analysis revealed that the EVH1
domain of Mena bound a polyproline structure of ABI1. Endogenous MENA
and ABL1 (189980) coprecipitated with epitope-tagged ABI1 from human
embryonic kidney cells. ABI1 dramatically promoted ABL1-mediated
tyrosine phosphorylation of MENA, but not of other substrates. Mutation
analysis demonstrated that Mena was tyrosine phosphorylated on tyr296.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned ANKRD12, which they designated
KIAA0874. The deduced protein contains 601 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected moderate expression in brain, kidney, heart, lung, liver,
testis, and ovary. Low expression was detected in skeletal muscle,
pancreas, and spleen.

Using the p19(Arf) isoform of mouse Cdkn2a (600160) as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen of a mouse embryonic fibroblast cDNA library, Tompkins
et al. (2006) cloned Ankrd12. The deduced protein contains an ankyrin
repeat. Tompkins et al. (2006) referred to Ankrd12 as Anco1.

GENE FUNCTION

Using an in vitro binding assay, Tompkins et al. (2006) confirmed
binding between mouse p19(Arf) and Ankrd12.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the ANKRD12
gene to chromosome 18.

601515	TITLE *601515 FIBROBLAST GROWTH FACTOR 14; FGF14
;;FIBROBLAST GROWTH FACTOR HOMOLOGOUS FACTOR 4; FHF4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

FGF14 belongs to a subclass of fibroblast growth factors that are
expressed in the developing and adult central nervous system (Smallwood
et al., 1996). For a discussion on the FGF gene family, see FGF12
(601513).

CLONING

Smallwood et al. (1996) identified and characterized 4 novel members of
the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family, including FGF14, which they
called FHF4. The genes were identified by a combination of random cDNA
sequencing, database searches, and degenerate PCR.

GENE FUNCTION

Wang et al. (2000) characterized 2 mouse isoforms of Fgf14, which they
called Fgf14-1a and Fgf14-1b, resulting from alternative first exons. In
situ hybridization showed that Fgf14 is widely expressed in mouse brain,
spinal cord, major arteries, and thymus between embryonic days 12.5 and
14.5. In mouse cerebellar development, Fgf14 was first observed at
postnatal day 1 in postmitotic granule cells and later in migrating and
postmigratory granule cells. The Fgf14 expression pattern in cerebellum
was complementary to that of Math1 (ATOH1; 601461), a marker for
proliferating granule cells in the external germinal layer.

MAPPING

By Southern blot hybridization of genomic DNA from rodent/human hybrid
cell lines carrying individual human chromosomes, Smallwood et al.
(1996) mapped the FGF14 gene to chromosome 13. Using an interspecific
backcross mapping panel, they mapped the mouse homolog to chromosome 14,
very close to the Rap2a (179540) gene, which in the human maps to 13q34.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a large 3-generation Dutch family with early-onset tremor,
dyskinesia, and slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia (SCA27; 609307),
van Swieten et al. (2003) found a phe145-to-ser mutation in the FGF14
gene (F145S; 601515.0001). The disorder was consistent with the
occurrence of ataxia and paroxysmal dyskinesia in Fgf14 knockout mice
(Wang et al., 2002).

In 1 of 208 unrelated patients with familial ataxia, Dalski et al.
(2005) identified a heterozygous 1-bp deletion in the FGF14 gene
(601515.0002). The patient had early onset of the disorder and mild
mental retardation.

ANIMAL MODEL

To study the role of Fgf14 in CNS development and adult brain function,
Wang et al. (2002) generated Fgf14-deficient mice that expressed an
FGF14/beta-galactosidase fusion protein in place of the normal Fgf14
protein. The Fgf14-deficient mice were viable, fertile, and anatomically
normal, but developed ataxia and a paroxysmal hyperkinetic movement
disorder. The authors noted that the motor abnormalities are associated
with dysfunction of the basal ganglia system and resemble several human
dystonia syndromes. Using neuropharmacologic studies, Wang et al. (2002)
showed that the Fgf14-deficient mice had reduced responses to dopamine
agonists. They suggested a function for Fgf14 in neuronal signaling,
axonal trafficking, and synaptosomal function.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA 27
FGF14, PHE145SER

In affected members of a 3-generation Dutch family with autosomal
dominant spinocerebellar ataxia-27 (609307), van Swieten et al. (2003)
identified a phe145-to-ser (F145S) mutation in the FGF14 gene. As
indicated by protein modeling, the amino acid change was predicted to
reduce the stability of the protein.

.0002
SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA 27
FGF14, 1-BP DEL, 487A

In a patient with spinocerebellar ataxia-27 (609307), Dalski et al.
(2005) identified a heterozygous 1-bp deletion (487delA) in exon 4 of
the FGF14 gene, resulting in premature termination of the protein and
loss of one-third of amino acid residues. The mutation was not
identified in 208 control samples. The patient had early onset of the
disorder and mild mental retardation.

;;MYOMEGALIN, RAT, HOMOLOG OF;;
MYOMEGALIN-LIKE PROTEIN; MMGL;;
KIAA0454;;
KIAA0477
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen to identify proteins that interact with
rat Pde4d (600129), Verde et al. (2001) cloned rat Pde4dip, which they
called myomegalin. Rat myomegalin is a 2,324-amino acid protein composed
mostly of alpha-helical and coiled-coil structures. It contains domains
that share similarity with microtubule-associated proteins, as well as a
leucine zipper identical to that found in Drosophila centrosomin (see
602039). Northern blot analysis detected a 7.5- to 8.0-kb transcript in
most rat tissues examined; testis-, heart-, and skeletal muscle-specific
variants were also detected. Western blot analysis detected myomegalin
at about 62 kD in testis and at 230 to 250 kD in heart and skeletal
muscle. Immunocytochemistry and transfection studies demonstrated
colocalization of myomegalin with Pde4d in the Golgi/centrosomal area of
cultured cells and in sarcomeric structures of skeletal muscle.

By analyzing ESTs for cardiac muscle-specific transcripts, followed by
screening heart cDNA libraries and 5-prime RACE, Soejima et al. (2001)
cloned 4 splice variants of PDE4DIP, which they called MMGL. The
variant-1 transcript has a long 3-prime untranslated region containing 9
possible polyadenylation signals, and it encodes a deduced 174-amino
acid protein. Variants 2, 3, and 4 encode proteins of 174, 173, and 240
amino acids, respectively. Northern blot analysis detected high
expression of a 1.0- to 1.3-kb band and lower expression of 4.4- and
8.5-kb bands in adult and fetal heart, skeletal muscle, and all specific
heart regions examined. Only the 4.4-kb transcript was detected in
aorta. Fluorescence-tagged variants 1 and 4 were expressed in both the
cytoplasm and nucleus of transfected mouse myocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis and coimmunoprecipitation studies of
myomegalin expressed in COS-7 cells, Verde et al. (2001) found that rat
myomegalin associated with variant 3 of Pde4d and that they were
sequestered in particulate structures.

GENE STRUCTURE

Soejima et al. (2001) determined that the PDE4DIP gene contains 8 exons
and spans at least 70 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Soejima et al. (2001) mapped the PDE4DIP
gene to chromosome 1q1, but by FISH they mapped it to chromosomes 1q1
and 1p1. They determined that chromosome 1q1 is the correct location of
the PDE4DIP gene.

Wilkinson et al. (2003) reported the molecular cloning of a novel
translocation t(1;5)(q23;q33). They showed that it resulted in fusion of
the PDGFRB gene (173410) on 5q33 with the PDE4DIP gene, which by this
evidence is located on 1q23. They found that the translocation
t(1;5)(q23;q33) resulted in a myeloproliferative disorder associated
with eosinophilia.

;;SAC DOMAIN-CONTAINING INOSITOL PHOSPHATASE 3; SAC3;;
KIAA0274
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The content of phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2) in
endosomal membranes changes dynamically with fission and fusion events
that generate or absorb intracellular transport vesicles. FIG4 is a
PtdIns(3,5)P2 5-phosphatase that functions in a trimolecular complex
that tightly regulates the level of PtdIns(3,5)P2. Other components of
this complex are the PtdIns(3,5)P2-synthesizing enzyme PIKFYVE (609414)
and its activator, VAC14 (604632) (Sbrissa et al., 2007).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1996) cloned full-length FIG4, which they called
KIAA0274. The deduced protein contains 907 amino acids. Northern blot
analysis detected expression in all tissues examined, with highest
expression in testis.

Sbrissa et al. (2007) stated that the full-length 907-amino acid SAC3
protein contains an N-terminal SAC phosphatase domain of about 400 amino
acids. SAC3 also has multiple sites for serine/threonine and tyrosine
phosphorylation and numerous motifs for interaction with intracellular
transport and sorting molecules. Western blot analysis of HEK293 human
embryonic kidney cells and other mammalian cell lines detected SAC3 at
an apparent molecular mass of 97 kD. The presence of a broad band
suggested posttranslational modification of the protein. Fractionation
of HEK293 cells showed that SAC3 associated with both cytosol and
membranes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chow et al. (2007) determined that the human FIG4 gene comprises 23
coding exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1996) mapped the KIAA0274
gene to chromosome 6. Chow et al. (2007) localized the gene to
chromosome 6q21.

GENE FUNCTION

Using coimmunoprecipitation analysis, Sbrissa et al. (2007) showed that
endogenous SAC3, PIKFYVE, and ARPIKFYVE (VAC14) formed a stable ternary
complex in HEK293 cells and other mammalian cell lines.
Immunoprecipitated epitope-tagged SAC3 hydrolyzed the D5 phosphate from
PtdIns(4,5)P2, PtdIns(3,5)P2, and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, but it did not use
PtdIns(5)P or other PtdIns substrates. Mutation analysis showed that
asp488 was required for SAC3 phosphatase activity. Overexpression of
SAC3 in HEK293 cells did not produce an obvious morphologic phenotype,
but it rendered cells prone to developing dilated intracellular
membranes, consistent with perturbation of membrane PtdIns(3,5)P2
levels. In contrast, depletion of SAC3 via small interfering RNA
enhanced endosome carrier vesicles/multivesicular body formation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Autosomal Recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease 4J

In 4 unrelated patients with autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth
disease type 4J (CMT4J; 611228), Chow et al. (2007) identified compound
heterozygous mutations in the FIG4 gene (609390.0001-609390.0005).

- Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis 11

In 5 unrelated patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS11;
612577), Chow et al. (2009) identified heterozygosity for a missense, 2
splice site, and 2 truncating mutations in the FIG4 gene (see, e.g.,
609390.0006-609390.0008). The mutations were shown to result in complete
or significant loss of protein function. Five different missense FIG4
mutations were identified in 5 patients with a diagnosis of ALS or
adult-onset primary lateral sclerosis (PLSA1; 611637), but these
mutations were not clearly shown to be pathogenic.

- Yunis-Varon Syndrome

In 5 patients from 3 unrelated families with Yunis-Varon syndrome (YVS;
216340), Campeau et al. (2013) identified homozygous or compound
heterozygous mutations in the FIG4 gene (609390.0009-609390.0012). The
phenotype was severe, characterized by cleidocranial dysplasia, digital
anomalies, hypotonia, dysmorphic facial features, and severe neurologic
involvement, all apparent from birth. Most patients died in infancy.
Tissue samples showed enlarged cytoplasmic vacuoles. All the mutations,
which were found by exome sequencing, resulted in complete loss of
protein function, which Campeau et al. (2013) suggested resulted in a
more severe phenotype than that observed in CMT4J; the latter disorder
is associated with at least 1 missense hypomorphic mutation in the FIG4
gene. The report demonstrated that absence of FIG4 activity leads to
central nervous system dysfunction and extensive skeletal anomalies,
which suggested a role for PI(3,5)P2 signaling in skeletal development
and maintenance.

ANIMAL MODEL

The phenotype of the 'pale tremor' (plt) mouse, identified by Chow et
al. (2007), is characterized by a multi-organ disorder with neuronal
degeneration in the central nervous system, peripheral neuronopathy, and
diluted pigmentation. Positional cloning identified insertion of
ETn2-beta (early transposon 2-beta) into intron 18 of the mouse Fig4
gene, the homolog of a yeast suppressor of actin (SAC) domain
phosphatidylinositol(3,5)P(2)5-phosphatase located in the vacuolar
membrane. The abnormal concentration of
phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate in cultured fibroblasts from pale
tremor mice demonstrated the conserved biochemical function of mammalian
Fig4. The cytoplasm of fibroblasts from pale tremor mice was filled with
large vacuoles that were immunoreactive for Lamp2 (309060), consistent
with dysfunction of the late endosome-lysosome axis. Neonatal
neurodegeneration in sensory and autonomic ganglia was followed by loss
of neurons from layers 4 and 5 of the cortex, deep cerebellar nuclei,
and other localized brain regions. The sciatic nerve exhibited reduced
numbers of large-diameter myelinated axons, slowed nerve conduction
velocity, and reduced amplitude of compound muscle action potentials.

Mutations affecting the conversion of PI3P to the signaling lipid
PI(3,5)P2 result in spongiform degeneration of mouse brain and are
associated with the human disorders Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Ferguson et al. (2009) reported
accumulation of the proteins Lc3II (MAP1LC3A; 601242), p62 (SQSTM1;
601530), and Lamp2 in neurons and astrocytes of mice with mutations in 2
components of the PI(3,5)P2 regulatory complex, Fig4 and Vac14 (604632).
Cytoplasmic inclusion bodies containing p62 and ubiquitinated proteins
were present in regions of the mutant brain that underwent degeneration.
Colocalization of p62 and LAMP2 in affected cells indicated that
formation or recycling of the autolysosome may be impaired. The authors
proposed a role for PI(3,5)P2 in autophagy in the mammalian central
nervous system and demonstrated that mutations affecting PI(3,5)P2 may
contribute to inclusion body disease.

In patient fibroblasts, cell culture, and transgenic mice, Lenk et al.
(2011) demonstrated that the I41T mutant protein (609390.0001) is
unstable, resulting in low levels of FIG4. Low levels of the protein
resulted from impaired interaction with VAC14, which stabilizes FIG4.
Overexpression of mutant I41T in Fig4-null mice to 10% of wildtype
levels rescued the severe neurodegenerative phenotype, whereas lesser
overexpression (2-fold) resulted in partial rescue and a CMT-like
phenotype. The abundance of the I41T protein in cultured cells could be
increased by treatment with a proteasome inhibitor. The findings
indicated that I41T is a hypomorphic allele and suggested that
increasing expression of the I41T mutant allele in CMT4J patients with
the mutation may be therapeutic.

In mouse tissue, Campeau et al. (2013) found that Fig4 expression in
calvaria, osteoblasts, and bone marrow cells was comparable to its
expression in brain. Fig4-null mice showed a smaller skeleton than
wildtype mice at day P21, with smaller long bones, clavicles, and pelvic
bones. Although the shapes of the bones were similar to wildtype,
Fig4-null mouse bones had significantly lower (50%) trabecular and
cortical density, bone volume fraction, bone surface, trabecular number,
and connectivity density, consistent with abnormal ossification.
Cultures of isolated osteoblasts from calvarial tissue showed extensive
vacuolization. Fig4-null mice did not exhibit aplasia or hypoplasia of
digits on the front or rear limbs.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, TYPE 4J
FIG4, ILE41THR

In 4 unrelated patients with severe early-onset autosomal recessive
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT4J; 611228), Chow et al. (2007) found
the same mutation in the FIG4 gene, a T-to-C transition at nucleotide
122 resulting in an ile-to-thr substitution at codon 41 (I41T). The
mutation occurred in compound heterozygosity in each patient with 1 of 4
other FIG4 mutations. The 4 patients carried I41T on the same 15-kb
haplotype, defined by 3 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs),
consistent with inheritance of a common ancestral mutant allele. The
isoleucine at codon 41 is invariant from human to yeast.

In patient fibroblasts, cell culture, and transgenic mice, Lenk et al.
(2011) demonstrated that the I41T mutant protein is unstable, resulting
in low levels of FIG4. Low levels of the protein resulted from impaired
interaction with VAC14 (604362), which stabilizes FIG4. Overexpression
of mutant I41T in Fig4-null mice to 10% of wildtype levels rescued the
neurodegenerative phenotype. The abundance of the I41T protein in
cultured cells could be increased by treatment with a proteasome
inhibitor. The findings indicated that I41T is a hypomorphic allele and
suggested that increasing expression of the I41T mutant allele in
patients with the mutation may be therapeutic.

CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, TYPE 4J
FIG4, 1-BP DEL, 294T

In a patient with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4J (611228), Chow et
al. (2007) identified a single-basepair deletion, of thymidine, at
nucleotide 294 of the FIG4 gene, resulting in frameshift and premature
termination of the protein (F98fsX102). The patient was compound
heterozygous for the I41T allele (609390.0001).

.0003
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, TYPE 4J
FIG4, ARG183TER

In a patient and her sib with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4J
(611228), Chow et al. (2007) found compound heterozygosity for a C-to-T
transition at nucleotide 718 of the FIG4 gene, resulting in an
arg-to-ter substitution at codon 183 (R183X), and the I41T mutation
(609390.0001). Both sibs had severe disease. The proband was a
functional quadriplegic, and her sib was wheelchair-bound with normal
use of his arms. Both had slow nerve conduction velocities. A sural
nerve biopsy from the proband demonstrated profound axonal loss, thinly
myelinated nerve fibers, and evidence of de- and remyelination.

.0004
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, TYPE 4J
FIG4, 8-BP DEL, NT1043

In a patient with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4J (611228), Chow et
al. (2007) found compound heterozygosity for the I41T mutation in FIG4
(609390.0001) and an 8-basepair deletion, of ATCAGGCA, starting at
nucleotide position 1043 (D348fsX359).

.0005
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, TYPE 4J
FIG4, 1-BP DEL, 759G

In a patient with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4J (611228), Chow et
al. (2007) found a single-basepair deletion of a guanine at position 759
of the FIG4 gene, resulting in a frameshift and early termination
(G253fsX261). The patient carried this mutation in compound
heterozygosity with the I41T mutation (609390.0001).

.0006
AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS 11
FIG4, ARG183TER

In a man with probable ALS11 (612577), Chow et al. (2009) identified a
heterozygous 547C-T transition in exon 6 of the FIG4 gene, resulting in
an arg183-to-ter (R183X) substitution, predicted to result in loss of
phosphatase activity. He had onset at age 62 and presented with bulbar
signs. He had prominent cortical spinal tract findings and moderate
lower motor neuron findings. EMG showed mild denervation of 3
extremities.

AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS 11
FIG4, IVS11DS, G-T, +5

In a woman with definite ALS11 (612577), Chow et al. (2009) identified a
heterozygous G-to-T transversion in intron 11 (1386+5G-T) of the FIG4
gene, predicted to result in the skipping of exon 12 or premature
termination. She had onset at age 57 and presented with involvement of
the upper extremity. She had both upper and lower motor neuron signs and
acute and chronic denervation on EMG.

.0008
AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS 11
FIG4, ASP53TYR

In a woman with definite ALS11 (612577), Chow et al. (2009) identified a
heterozygous 157G-T transversion in exon 2 of the FIG4 gene, resulting
in an asp53-to-tyr (D53Y) substitution. In vitro functional expression
studies in yeast showed that the mutant protein had significantly less
activity compared to wildtype. The patient presented at age 56 with
bulbar signs. She had moderate corticospinal findings, and autopsy
showed lower motor neuron loss.

YUNIS-VARON SYNDROME
FIG4, 2-BP DEL, 1260GT

In 2 sibs, born of consanguineous Mexican parents, with Yunis-Varon
syndrome (YVS; 216340), who had been reported by Corona-Rivera et al.
(2011), Campeau et al. (2013) identified a homozygous 2-bp deletion
(c.1260_1261delGT) in exon 11 of the FIG4 gene, resulting in a
frameshift and premature termination (Thr422GlnfsTer6) predicted to
cause protein truncation upstream of the phosphatase catalytic motif and
complete loss of function. Each unaffected parent was heterozygous fort
the mutation, which was found by exome sequencing.

.0010
YUNIS-VARON SYNDROME
FIG4, GLY104ASP

In 2 sibs, born of unrelated English parents, with Yunis-Varon syndrome
(216340), who had been reported by Garrett et al. (1990), Campeau et al.
(2013) identified compound heterozygous mutations in the FIG4 gene: a
c.311G-A transition in exon 4, resulting in a gly104-to-asp (G104D)
substitution at a highly conserved residue located at the beginning of
beta-sheet 7 in the noncatalytic, protein-binding domain of FIG4, and an
8-bp deletion (c.831_838delTAAATTTG; 609390.0011) in exon 8, resulting
in a frameshift and premature termination (Lys278TrpfsTer6). Each
unaffected parent carried 1 of the mutations, which were found by exome
sequencing. Transfection of the G104D mutation in cultured fibroblasts
from the Fig4-null mouse failed to correct cytoplasmic vacuolization,
consistent with complete loss of function.

YUNIS-VARON SYNDROME
FIG4, LEU175PRO

In an Italian girl, born of unrelated parents, with Yunis-Varon syndrome
(216340), who had been described by Dworzak et al. (1995), Campeau et
al. (2013) identified a homozygous c.524T-C transition in exon 6 of the
FIG4 gene, resulting in a leu175-to-pro (L175P) substitution at a highly
conserved residue in alpha-helix 2 of a noncatalytic, protein-binding
domain of FIG4. Each unaffected parent was heterozygous for the
mutation, which was found by exome sequencing. Transfection of the
mutation in cultured fibroblasts from the Fig4-null mouse failed to
correct cytoplasmic vacuolization, consistent with complete loss of
function.

609683	TITLE *609683 DNA CROSS-LINK REPAIR PROTEIN 1B; DCLRE1B
;;SNM1, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF, B; SNM1B;;
APOLLO
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DNA interstrand cross-links prevent strand separation, thereby
physically blocking transcription, replication, and segregation of DNA.
DCLRE1B is one of several evolutionarily conserved genes involved in
repair of interstrand cross-links (Dronkert et al., 2000).

CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to S. cerevisiae Pso2/Snm1
and human SNM1 (DCLRE1A; 609682), Dronkert et al. (2000) identified
partial clones encoding mouse and human DCLRE1B, which they called
SNM1B. The human and mouse SNM1B proteins share high similarity with one
another, but less similarity with S. cerevisiae Snm1.

By searching databases using the partial SNM1B sequence obtained by
Dronkert et al. (2000) as query, Demuth et al. (2004) identified
full-length SNM1B clones. The deduced protein contains 532 amino acids
and shares similarity with S. cerevisiae Pso2 only in its N terminus.
Demuth et al. (2004) also identified a rare SNM1B transcript lacking
exon 2 that may encode smaller proteins without the N-terminal Pso2
homology domain. RT-PCR detected SNM1B expression in HeLa cells, but
protein levels were below the level of detection by Western blot
analysis.

Lenain et al. (2006) reported that the deduced 532-amino acid SNM1B
protein has an N-terminal beta-lactamase (LACTB; 608440) domain and a
central beta-CASP domain. Because SNM1B shares higher sequence
similarity with Artemis (DCLRE1C; 605988) than with SNM1A, Lenain et al.
(2006) named it Apollo, after the twin brother of Artemis in Greek
mythology.

GENE FUNCTION

Mutation in the yeast Pso2 gene confers sensitivity to interstrand
cross-linking agents. Demuth et al. (2004) found that depletion of HeLa
cell SNM1B by small interfering RNA conferred sensitivity to mitomycin
C, cisplatin, and ionizing radiation. SNM1B-depleted cells showed an
elevated rate of chromosome breakage. Demuth et al. (2004) concluded
that SNM1B may be involved in homologous recombination repair of
double-strand breaks arising as intermediates during repair of
interstrand cross-links.

Lenain et al. (2006) showed that purified human Apollo exhibited
5-prime-to-3-prime DNA exonuclease activity against single- and
double-stranded DNA, but not against DNA substrates with telomeric
sequences. Apollo did not show endonuclease activity. Yeast 2-hybrid and
protein pull-down assays showed that the N terminus of Apollo bound TRF2
(TERF2; 602027), another beta-CASP metallo-beta-lactamase family member.
DNA was not required for the Apollo-TRF2 interaction. Apollo
preferentially localized to telomeres in a TRF2-dependent manner.
Knockdown of Apollo in HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells exacerbated
sensitivity to TRF2 inhibition and resulted in severe growth defects,
increased number of telomere-induced DNA-damage foci, and telomere
fusion.

The 6-protein mammalian telomere protection complex shelterin contains
the closely related proteins TRF1 (600951) and TRF2, which recruit
various proteins to telomeres. Chen et al. (2008) showed that the TRF
homology domain docking site of TRF2 binds the shelterin accessory
factor Apollo, which does not interact with the TRF homology domain of
TRF1.

Ye et al. (2010) showed that TRF2 stimulated the exonuclease activity of
Apollo against single-stranded telomeric DNA, but not against
double-stranded substrates that mimicked telomeric DNA ends. Both
proteins bound an 800-bp telomeric sequence artificially integrated into
the middle of chromosome 4q. Mutation of catalytic residues in Apollo
revealed that its exonuclease activity was required to protect
telomerase (see 187270)-negative cells against accumulation of telomere
dysfunction-induced foci and cell senescence. Telomere deficiencies due
to inhibition or knockdown of TOP2-alpha (TOP2A; 126430) were rescued by
overexpression of Apollo and TRF2. Overexpression of Apollo and TRF2
reduced the requirement for TOP2-alpha for telomere replication. Ye et
al. (2010) found that TRF2 showed preferential binding to positively
supercoiled DNA. They hypothesized that TRF2-Apollo and TOP2 act in
concert to release positive superhelical strain created in telomeric DNA
during replication fork progression.

GENE STRUCTURE

Demuth et al. (2004) determined that the DCLRE1B gene contains 4 exons
that span 7 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Demuth et al. (2004) mapped the DCLRE1B
gene to chromosome 1p13.3-p13.1.

603847	TITLE *603847 NADH-UBIQUINONE OXIDOREDUCTASE Fe-S PROTEIN 5; NDUFS5
;;COMPLEX I, MITOCHONDRIAL RESPIRATORY CHAIN, 15-KD SUBUNIT
DESCRIPTION The multisubunit NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) is the first
enzyme complex in the electron transport chain of mitochondria. The
iron-sulfur protein (IP) fraction is made up of 7 subunits. See NDUFS1
(157655). By a combination of EST database searching and RT-PCR, Loeffen
et al. (1999) isolated cDNAs encoding the human homolog of the bovine
15-kD IP subunit. The predicted 106-amino acid human NDUFS5 protein
shares 75% homology with the bovine protein. Northern dot blot analysis
revealed that NDUFS5 was expressed in all human tissues tested. Mao et
al. (1998) identified an NDUFS5 cDNA, HD-CI-15, among a collection of
cDNAs expressed in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells.

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids, Loeffen et al. (1999) mapped the
NDUFS5 gene to chromosome 1. By radiation hybrid analysis, Emahazion et
al. (1998) mapped the NDUFS5 gene to 1p34.2-p33.

Smeitink and van den Heuvel (1999) reviewed the available molecular data
regarding the human nuclear-encoded complex I subunits.

609538	TITLE *609538 PROTEIN-TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE, MITOCHONDRIAL, 1; PTPMT1
;;PTEN-LIKE PHOSPHATASE; PLIP;;
PHOSPHOINOSITIDE LIPID PHOSPHATASE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases using the phosphatase domain of PTEN (601728) as
query, Pagliarini et al. (2004) identified PTPMT1, which they called
PLIP. Database analysis using the mouse ortholog, which encodes a
deduced 261-amino acid protein, revealed 60 orthologs from 4 different
phylogenetic kingdoms that share more than 70% amino acid identity
within the active site region. The active site sequence between amino
acids 128 and 148 of mouse and human PLIP is identical. Northern blot
analysis of several mouse tissues detected highest expression in testis.
In addition to testis, RT-PCR detected expression in brain, liver,
skeletal muscle, and uterus, with low levels in all other tissues
examined.

Pagliarini et al. (2005) found that mouse Ptpmt1 was targeted to
mitochondria in transfected COS-1 cells. Targeting was determined by an
N-terminal signal sequence, and Ptpmt1 was anchored to the matrix face
of the inner membrane.

GENE FUNCTION

Pagliarini et al. (2004) found that recombinant mouse Plip showed highly
selective activity against phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate
(PtdIns(5)P), with a pH optimum at 5.5. Plip showed activity against
PtdIns(5)P that was 44-fold greater than that against PtdIns(3,5)P2, its
second most preferred substrate, when the phosphoinositides were
presented in a lipid bilayer with phosphatidylserine.

Pagliarini et al. (2005) found that knockdown of Ptpmt1 expression in a
rat pancreatic insulinoma cell line altered the mitochondrial
phosphoprotein profile and enhanced both ATP production and insulin
secretion.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PTPMT1
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP RH47256).

606513	TITLE *606513 PROTEIN KINASE C AND CASEIN KINASE SUBSTRATE IN NEURONS 3; PACSIN3
DESCRIPTION PACSINs are a family of cytoplasmic phosphoproteins that play a role in
vesicle formation and transport.

CLONING

Howard et al. (1999) cloned a cDNA encoding PACSIN3, which they regarded
as the human ortholog of the chicken focal adhesion protein, Fap52.

Using murine cDNAs for Pacsin1 (606512) and Pacsin2 (604960) as probes
to search EST databases, Modregger et al. (2000) obtained cDNAs encoding
mouse and human PACSIN3. Sequence analysis predicted that the 424-amino
acid human PACSIN3 protein, which is 94% identical to the mouse protein,
has an N-terminal CDC15 domain and a conserved C-terminal SH3 domain
preceded by a proline-rich region. RNA dot blot analysis detected
PACSIN3 expression mainly in skeletal muscle, heart, lung, kidney,
adrenal gland, and placenta. Immunoblot analysis showed predominant
expression of a 48-kD protein in mouse lung, skeletal muscle, and heart;
expression was also detected in brain, kidney, and uterus.
Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated colocalization of PACSIN3
with dynamin (DNM1; 602377) on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma
membrane. GST pull-down analysis indicated binding to dynamin,
synaptojanin (SYNJ1; 604297), and N-WASP (WASL; 605056) through an
intact SH3 domain. Yeast 2-hybrid analysis established that all 3
PACSINs can form both homo- and heteroaggregates. Functional analysis
showed that overexpressed wildtype PACSINs, but not SH3-deleted PACSINs,
blocked the endocytosis of transferrin (TF; 190000).

Sumoy et al. (2001) also cloned cDNAs encoding PACSIN3. Northern blot
analysis revealed ubiquitous expression of a 2.2-kb PACSIN3 transcript,
with higher levels in heart and skeletal muscle. Immunofluorescence
microscopy demonstrated cytoplasmic expression but, unlike chicken
Fap52, no concentration at focal adhesions.

MAPPING

Sumoy et al. (2001) stated that the PACSIN3 gene maps to 11p11.

;;NOS2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Tsuda et al. (2003) cloned mouse Nanos2. The deduced protein contains a
zinc finger motif. Nanos2 expression was restricted to male mouse germ
cells.

Using quantitative PCR, Angeles Julaton and Reijo Pera (2011) detected
highest NANOS2 expression in adult and fetal testis. Weaker NANOS2
expression was detected in other fetal tissues, particularly in brain,
kidney, liver, lung, ovary, skeletal muscle, spleen, and thymus. NANOS2
was also detected in adult ovary and spleen, with little to no
expression in other adult tissues. Western blot analysis detected NANOS2
at an apparent molecular mass of 24 kD in adult and fetal testis and
ovary.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the NANOS2 gene to chromosome 19q13.32 based on an
alignment of the NANOS2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC042883) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

ANIMAL MODEL

Tsuda et al. (2003) found that Nanos2-null mice were viable and showed
no apparent abnormalities, but Nanos2-null testes had defects in
spermatogenesis. The weight of testes in 4-week-old mutant males was
reduced to about 30% of normal, and no germ cells were detected.
Morphologic examination revealed apoptotic germ cells after embryonic
day 15.5, and apoptosis continued until the germ cells had completely
disappeared by 4 weeks of age. In contrast, female gonads were
morphologically and functionally normal, and homozygous female mice were
fertile.

Using Nanos2-null mice, Suzuki and Saga (2008) showed that Nanos2
suppressed meiosis in male mouse germ cells by preventing Stra8 (609987)
expression, which was required for premeiotic DNA replication, after
Cyp26b1 (605207) downregulation. Forced expression of Nanos2 in female
germ cells resulted in inhibition of meiosis and induction of male-type
differentiation, indicating that Nanos2 activates a male-specific
genetic program.

;;ASPARAGINE-LINKED GLYCOSYLATION 11, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF;;
KIAA0266
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ALG11 is a mannosyltransferase that uses GDP-mannose to sequentially add
the fourth and fifth mannose residues to growing dolichol-linked
oligosaccharide side chains at the outer leaflet of the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER). Upon completion, the lipid-linked polyoligosaccharides
are translocated to the ER lumen for subsequent transfer to substrate
asparagine residues of newly synthesized glycoproteins (Rind et al.,
2010).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated KG-1 immature
myeloid cell line, Nagase et al. (1996) cloned ALG11, which they
designated KIAA0266. The transcript contains a repetitive element in its
3-prime end, and the deduced protein contains 766 amino acids. Northern
blot analysis revealed low and uniform expression of ALG11 in all human
tissues and cell lines examined.

Rind et al. (2010) predicted that human ALG11 contains 2 Rossmann-like
type B domains, which are separated by a catalytic flexible hinge
region, and a conserved C-terminal nucleotide sugar-binding region.
ALG11 also has 2 predicted transmembrane domains and 2 putative
N-glycosylation sites. Immunofluorescence analysis of human fibroblasts
revealed colocalization of ALG11 with an ER marker, calnexin (CANX;
114217).

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1996) mapped the ALG11 gene
to chromosome 13. Hartz (2010) mapped the ALG11 gene to chromosome
13q14.3 based on an alignment of the ALG11 sequence (GenBank GENBANK
AK025456) with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 Turkish sibs, born of consanguineous parents, with congenital
disorder of glycosylation type Ip (CDG1P; 613661), Rind et al. (2010)
identified a homozygous mutation (L86S; 613666.0001) in the ALG11 gene.
The phenotype was a multisystem metabolic disorder characterized by
hypotonia, seizures, developmental retardation, deafness, and death by
age 2 years. One affected child showed mild dysmorphic features.

In 3 unrelated patients with CDG1P, Thiel et al. (2012) identified
compound heterozygous or homozygous mutations in the ALG11 gene
(613666.0002-613666.0006). All mutations occurred in conserved residues,
and the cellular biochemical defects could be rescued by retroviral
complementation with wildtype ALG11. Glucose starvation prior to
metabolic labeling of patient-derived fibroblasts was a crucial step for
the correct biochemical diagnosis.

ALG11, LEU86SER

In 2 Turkish sibs, born of consanguineous parents, with congenital
disorder of glycosylation type Ip (CDG1P; 613661), Rind et al. (2010)
identified a homozygous 257T-C transition in exon 2 of the ALG11 gene,
resulting in a leu86-to-ser (L86S) substitution in a highly conserved
region in the N terminus between 2 hydrophobic helices at the end of a
glycine-rich motif. Each unaffected parent was heterozygous for the
mutation, which was not found in 100 control alleles. Introduction of
wildtype ALG11 in patient fibroblasts and yeast deficient in the enzyme
complemented the biochemical abnormality. Immunofluorescent studies
showed that the mutation did not affect protein localization and did not
appear to affect the stability of the mannosyltransferase complex.
However, studies in yeast showed that the mutant L86S protein had some
residual activity, but not as much as wildtype, suggesting that it is a
leaky mutation.

ALG11, 18-BP DEL, NT623

In a 7-year-old girl with CDG1P (613661), Thiel et al. (2012) identified
compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the ALG11 gene: an 18-bp
deletion (623_642) resulting in a frameshift and premature truncation
after 210 amino acids, and an 836A-C transversion resulting in a
tyr279-to-ser (Y279S; 613666.0003) substitution. The patient had
developmental delay, mental retardation, axial hypotonia, slight
peripheral hypertonia, no communication and poor social interaction,
seizures, and strabismus. Neither mutation was found in 120 control
alleles. Biochemical analysis showed a CDG type I pattern. However, the
pathologic glycosylation phenotype was only apparent after glucose
starvation in patient fibroblasts; then, analysis of dolichol-linked
oligosaccharides led to the emergence of pathologic shortened
intermediate dolichol-linked oligosaccharides, indicating a defect in
biosynthesis which could be rescued by retroviral complementation with
wildtype ALG11.

and a 1192G-A transition resulting in a glu398-to-lys (E398K;

retardation, central hypotonia, peripheral hypertonia, no communication,
and seizures. Other anomalies included dystrophic facial features with
high forehead, long philtrum, and retrognathia, dry scaly skin,
oscillation of body temperature, inverted nipples, fat pads, and
scoliosis. Neither mutation was found in 120 control alleles.
Biochemical analysis showed a CDG type I pattern. However, the

600616	TITLE *600616 LUMICAN; LUM
;;LDC
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Lumican, a member of the small interstitial proteoglycan gene (SIPG)
family, is a keratan sulfate proteoglycan present in large quantities in
the corneal stroma and in interstitial collagenous matrices of the
heart, aorta, skeletal muscle, skin, and intervertebral discs
(Chakravarti and Magnuson, 1995). Other SIPG members are decorin
(125255), biglycan (301870), and fibromodulin (600245).

CLONING

Chakravarti et al. (1995) derived the primary structure of lumican from
cDNA sequencing of chicken, bovine, and human clones and demonstrated
that lumican shows all the characteristic features of the SIPG family,
namely, 4 and 2 cysteines in the N- and C-terminal globular domains, I
and III, and a central, cysteine-free domain II, with 9 beta
sheet-forming leucine motifs. This human core protein contains 4
putative N-glycosylation sites in the central domains, all or some of
which are substituted with keratan sulfate side chains. At the amino
acid level, it is 90% identical with the bovine and 72% identical with
the chicken core protein. By immunohistochemical staining, Chakravarti
et al. (1995) showed that lumican is present not only in the corneal
stroma but also in the dermal area of the skin.

Grover et al. (1995) used PCR techniques to derive a human lumican cDNA
sequence from RNA obtained from intestine, placenta, and articular
cartilage. The deduced lumican protein sequence had 338 amino acids,
including a putative 18-residue signal peptide. The lumican message is
expressed at high levels in adult articular chondrocytes, but at low
levels in the young juvenile. It is present in the extracellular matrix
of human articular cartilage at all ages, although its abundance is far
greater in the adult. In adult cartilage, lumican exists predominantly
in a glycoprotein form lacking keratan sulfate, whereas the juvenile
form of the molecule is a proteoglycan.

Yeh et al. (2010) found that zebrafish Lum existed as a keratan sulfate
proteoglycan in corneal stroma and as an unglycanated glycoprotein in
sclera.

GENE STRUCTURE

Grover et al. (1995) showed that the LDC gene is spread over about 7.5
kb of genomic DNA and consists of 3 exons separated by introns of 2.2
and 3.5 kb.

MAPPING

Chakravarti and Magnuson (1995) localized the mouse lumican gene to
distal chromosome 10 by segregation analysis of restriction fragment
length variants (RFLVs) in recombinant inbred (RI) strains of mice.

Chakravarti et al. (1995) localized the lumican gene to human chromosome
12 by hybridizing a cDNA probe to a Southern blot containing a
human/hamster monochromosomal mapping panel DNA. Sublocalization to
12q21.3-q22 was performed by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

By PCR analysis of human/hamster somatic cell hybrids Grover et al.
(1995) mapped the LDC gene to chromosome 12 and regionalized it to
chromosome 12q22 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

GENE FUNCTION

Like decorin, lumican interacts with collagen and limits growth of
fibrils in diameter (Chakravarti and Magnuson, 1995). In the cornea,
lumican not only interacts with collagen molecules to limit fibril
growth, but by virtue of its keratan sulfate-containing
glycosaminoglycan side chains LDC plays a critical role in the regular
spacing of fibrils and acquisition of corneal transparency.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Association with Myopia

For discussion of a possible association between variation in the LUM
gene and myopia, see MYP3 (603221).

ANIMAL MODEL

Lumican and fibromodulin (600245) regulate the assembly of collagens
into higher-order fibrils in connective tissues. Jepsen et al. (2002)
showed that mice deficient in both of these proteoglycans manifest
several clinical features of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (see 130000).
Double-null Lum -/- Fmod -/- mice were smaller than their wildtype
littermates and displayed gait abnormality, joint laxity, and
age-dependent osteoarthritis. Misaligned patellae, severe knee
dysmorphogenesis, and extreme tendon weakness were the likely causes for
joint laxity in the double-nulls. Fibromodulin deficiency alone led to
significant reduction in tendon stiffness, with further loss in
stiffness in a Lum gene dose-dependent way. At the protein level, Jepsen
et al. (2002) showed marked increase of lumican in Fmod -/- tendons,
which may partially rescue the tendon phenotype in this genotype. These
results established fibromodulin as a key regulator and lumican as a
modulator of tendon strength. A disproportionate increase in small
diameter immature collagen fibrils and a lack of progression to mature,
large diameter fibrils in the Fmod -/- background constitute the
underlying cause of tendon weakness and suggest that fibromodulin aids
fibril maturation. The study suggested that lumican and fibromodulin may
be key players in the pathogenesis of certain types of Ehlers-Danlos
syndrome and other connective tissue disorders.

Yeh et al. (2010) found that knockdown of zebrafish Lum by antisense
morpholinos resulted in ocular enlargement resembling axial myopia.
Mutant zebrafish also showed enlarged pericardium and deformed body
shape. Ocular enlargement was due to disruption of the collagen fibril
arrangement in the sclera and resulted in scleral thinning.
Administration of muscarinic receptor antagonists subdued ocular
enlargement.

;;SGT1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Kitagawa et al. (1999) identified the S. cerevisiae SGT1 (suppressor of
G2 allele of SKP1) gene, which, like SKP1 (see 601434), is required for
both the G1/S and G2/M transitions in the cell cycle. The SGT1 protein
physically associates with the SKP1 protein and the SCF (SKP1/Cdc53/F
box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex (see 603134) and is required for
kinetochore function, where it serves as an activator of the Ctf13
protein. Kitagawa et al. (1999) also cloned the human homolog of the
yeast SGT1 gene. The yeast and human SGT1 proteins share 26% identity
and 30% similarity. Human SGT1 could perform the essential functions of
SGT1 in budding yeast, indicating that SGT1 function is conserved
throughout eukaryotes.

MAPPING

Gross (2012) mapped the SUGT1 gene to chromosome 13q14.3 based on an
alignment of the SUGT1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF132856) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

615203	TITLE *615203 RHOMBOID DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; RHBDD2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

RHBDD2 is a distantly related member of the rhomboid family of
membrane-bound proteases that catalyze regulated intramembrane
proteolysis (Ahmedli et al., 2013).

CLONING

Using database analysis to identify rhomboid-like genes that were
overexpressed in breast cancers, Abba et al. (2009) identified
full-length RHBDD2 and a splice variant lacking exon 2. Western blot
analysis revealed that full-length RHBDD2 had an apparent molecular mass
of 47 kD, whereas the smaller isoform had an apparent molecular mass of
40 kD.

Independently, Ahmedli et al. (2013) identified full-length human
RHBDD2, which encodes a 364-amino acid protein. They also identified 2
variants that, compared with full-length RHBDD2, include insertions in
intron 1, and both encode a 223-amino acid protein. RHBDD2 was predicted
to have either 5 or 7 transmembrane helices and a potential glycine
zipper motif. Northern blot analysis detected a major transcript of
about 2.0 kb in all mouse tissues examined, with highest expression in
brain, kidney, testis, and ovary, and weaker expression in heart, liver,
spleen, embryo, and lung. Transcripts of 4.0 and 2.5 kb were also
detected in all tissues examined. All 3 transcripts were detected in
mouse retina. Quantitative RT-PCR of developing mouse retina revealed
low Rhbdd2 expression at postnatal day 1, with expression increasing to
a maximum at postnatal day 14, and decreasing to postnatal day 30. In
transfected HEK293 cells, mouse Rhbdd2 localized predominantly to the
cis-Golgi. Rhbdd2 retained its association with the Golgi marker Gm130
(GOLGA2; 602580) during the cell cycle and following disruption of the
Golgi with brefeldin A. Rhbdd2 also colocalized with Gm130 in the inner
segment of photoreceptor cells and in the perinuclear region of ganglion
cells in mouse retina.

GENE FUNCTION

Abba et al. (2009) found that expression of RHBDD2 was upregulated in
primary tumors from patients with recurrent breast cancer and in
advanced stage III breast carcinomas. RHBDD2 expression was linked to
shortened metastasis-free interval and relapse-free survival, but only
in patients with cancers negative for estrogen receptor-alpha (ESR1;
133430). Amplification at the RHBDD2 locus was detected in 21% of 98
invasive breast carcinomas and in MCF7 and T47D breast carcinoma cell
lines. Knockdown of RHBDD2 in MCF7 cells via small interfering RNA
reduced proliferation, but it did not affect cell viability or
morphology.

Ahmedli et al. (2013) found that disruption of the glycine zipper motif
in mouse Rhbdd2 disrupted its Golgi localization.

GENE STRUCTURE

Abba et al. (2009) determined that the RHBDD2 gene contains 5 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Abba et al. (2009) mapped the RHBDD2 gene
to chromosome 7q11.23.

164015	TITLE *164015 MATRIN 3; MATR3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Stuurman et al. (1990) showed that nuclear matrins, a group of proteins
in the nuclear matrix, are present in cultured cells from a variety of
tissues and are probably common to mammalian cells. Stuurman et al.
(1990) differentiated 2 nuclear matrix fractions: the peripheral nuclear
matrix (matrix proteins that remain insoluble after reduction), and the
internal nuclear matrix (matrix proteins released by reduction).

Nakayasu and Berezney (1991) identified several novel nuclear matrins
from a rat liver nuclear matrix and characterized them by peptide maps,
polyclonal antibodies generated against the individual matrins, and
indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. They designated the proteins
matrins 3, 4, D-G, 12, and 13.

Belgrader et al. (1991) cloned a full-length rat insulinoma cDNA that
encodes an acidic internal matrix protein designated matrin-3. The
deduced 845-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of
approximately 95 kD. Its primary structure consists of 33% charged
residues and is generally hydrophilic. Like the lamins (see 150330),
matrin-3 has a positively charged N terminus that contains a large
number of amino acids with free hydroxyl groups. A highly acidic domain
near the C terminus, in which 32% of the amino acids are acidic, is a
characteristic found in other nuclear proteins.

Nagase et al. (1998) cloned and sequenced matrin-3, which they called
KIAA0723, from human brain cDNA libraries. The deduced protein contains
847 amino acids.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the MATR3
gene to chromosome 5 (TMAP WI-15469).

Using genomic sequence analysis, Senderek et al. (2009) mapped the MATR3
gene to chromosome 5q31.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 unrelated families with a form of distal myopathy that included
vocal cord and pharyngeal weakness (MPD2; 606070), Senderek et al.
(2009) identified the same missense mutation in the MATR3 gene (S85C;

In affected members of a North American family originally reported by
Feit et al. (1998) and in an unrelated Bulgarian family with distal
myopathy with vocal cord and pharyngeal weakness (MPD2; 606070),
Senderek et al. (2009) identified heterozygosity for a C-to-G
transversion at nucleotide 254 in exon 2 of the MATR3 gene that resulted
in a change from serine to cysteine at codon 85 (S85C).

605837	TITLE *605837 HECT DOMAIN AND RCC1-LIKE DOMAIN 2; HERC2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The HERC2 gene encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase that shuttles between the
nucleus and the cytoplasm. It binds to UBE3A (601623) and activates the
ubiquitin ligase activity of that gene (summary by Puffenberger et al.,
2012).

For background information on the HERC gene family, see HERC1 (605109).

CLONING

Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS; 176270) and Angelman syndrome (AS; 105830)
result from deletions and loss of function of oppositely imprinted genes
located within the proximal 2 Mb of the 15q11-q13 region. Low-copy
repeat elements have been identified in the vicinity of the 3 deletion
breakpoint hotspots using molecular and cytologic methods. Using
positional cloning from low-copy repeats flanking 15q11-q13, genomic
sequence analysis, EST database searching, PCR, and long-range RT-PCR,
Ji et al. (1999) obtained a cDNA encoding HERC2, which is identical to a
partial cDNA, KIAA0393, identified by Nagase et al. (1997). Sequence
analysis predicted that the 4,834-amino acid protein, which is 95%
identical and 99% similar to the mouse protein, contains 3 RCC1-like
domains (RLDs); a putative ZZ-type zinc finger motif with 6 conserved
cysteines and 2 outlying histidine residues; a C-terminal HECT or E3
ubiquitin ligase (see UBE3A; 601623) domain; and several potential
phosphorylation sites. The overall structure is similar to that of
HERC1, although HERC1 has only 2 RLDs and no zinc finger motif. The
C-terminal region of HERC2 resembles that of HERC3 (605200). Northern
blot analysis revealed ubiquitous expression of a 15.5-kb HERC2
transcript, with high levels in fetal tissues and adult skeletal muscle,
heart, ovary, testis, and brain.

GENE FUNCTION

Ji et al. (1999) identified splice junction mutations in the Herc2 gene
in chemically-induced jdf2 mutant alleles. The mutations led to exon
skipping and premature termination, resulting in neuromuscular secretory
vesicle defects, sperm acrosome defects, and juvenile lethality in jdf2
mice.

MAPPING

Nagase et al. (1997) mapped the HERC2 gene, which they called KIAA0393,
to chromosome 15 using radiation hybrid analysis. By Southern blot
analysis of YACs and radiation hybrid analysis, Ji et al. (1999) mapped
the HERC2 gene to 15q11-q13, very close to the P gene (OCA2; 611409).
Southern blot analysis of PWS and AS patients resulted in HERC2 signals
of 50% intensity compared with controls. The mouse Herc2 gene maps to
chromosome 7C, within the juvenile development and fertility-2 (jdf2)
interval (Ji et al., 1999).

Kayser et al. (2008) identified the HERC2 gene within a region on
chromosome 15q13.1 linked to determination of human iris color.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Skin, Hair, Eye Pigmentation

In a large genomewide scan to identify variants associated with hair and
eye pigmentation, skin sensitivity to sun, and freckling, Sulem et al.
(2007) identified a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), dbSNP
rs1667394, in intron 4 of the HERC2 gene (605837.0001) that was
associated with blue eye color and blond hair. Of several SNPs within a
1-Mb region of linkage overlapping the OCA2 gene (611409), dbSNP
rs1667394 had the strongest association with pigmentation. Given the
established relationship between OCA2 and pigmentation, Sulem et al.
(2007) considered it unlikely that the association signal provided by
this SNP was due to a functional effect on HERC2.

In 3 independent genomewide association studies and a genomewide linkage
study involving over 2,600 persons from the Netherlands, Kayser et al.
(2008) found that the chromosome 15q13.1 region is the predominant
region involved in human iris color. There were no other regions showing
consistent genomewide evidence for association and linkage to iris
color. SNPs in the HERC2 gene and, to a lesser extent, in the
neighboring OCA2 gene (611409) were independently associated with iris
color variation. Kayser et al. (2008) found that HERC2 dbSNP rs916977
(605837.0002) showed a clinal allele distribution across 23 European
populations that was significantly correlated to iris color variation.
They suggested that genetic variants regulating expression of the OCA2
gene exist in the HERC2 gene or, alternatively, with the 11.7 kb of
sequence between OCA2 and HERC2, and that most iris color variation in
Europeans is explained by those 2 genes. They further suggested that
testing markers in the HERC2-OCA2 region may be useful in forensic
applications to predict eye color phenotypes of unknown persons of
European genetic origin.

Duffy et al. (2007) demonstrated that haplotypes of 3 SNPs within the
first intron of the OCA2 gene are strongly associated with variation in
human eye color. Following up on this study, Sturm et al. (2008)
described additional fine association mapping of eye color SNPs in the
intergenic region upstream of OCA2 and within the neighboring HERC2
gene. They screened an additional 92 SNPs in 300 to 3,000 European
individuals and found that a single SNP in intron 86 of HERC2, dbSNP
rs12913832 (605837.0003), predicted eye color significantly better than
their previous best OCA2 haplotype. Comparison of sequence alignments of
multiple species showed that this SNP lies in the center of a short
highly conserved sequence and that the blue eye-associated allele
(frequency 78%) breaks up this conserved sequence, part of which forms a
consensus binding site for the helicase-like transcription factor (HLTF;
603257). Sturm et al. (2008) also demonstrated that the OCA2 coding SNP
R419Q (611409.0012) acts as a penetrance modifier of this new HERC2 SNP
for eye color and, somewhat independently, of melanoma risk. Sturm et
al. (2008) concluded that the conserved region around dbSNP rs12913832
(the SNP in intron 86 of HERC2) represents a regulatory region
controlling constitutive expression of OCA2 and that the C allele at
this SNP leads to decreased expression of OCA2, particularly within iris
melanocytes, which they postulated to be the ultimate cause of blue eye
color.

In a 3-generation Danish family segregating blue and brown eye color,
Eiberg et al. (2008) used fine mapping to identify a 166-kb candidate
region within the HERC2 gene. Further studies of SNPs within this region
among 144 blue-eyed and 45 brown-eyed individuals identified 2 SNPs,
dbSNP rs1129038 and the strongly conserved dbSNP rs12913832, that showed
significant associations with the blue-eyed phenotype (p = 6.2 x
10(-46)). A common founder haplotype containing these SNPs was
identified among blue-eyed persons from Denmark, Turkey, and Jordan. In
vitro functional expression studies in human colon carcinoma cells
showed that what the authors referred to as the 'G' allele of dbSNP
rs12913832, present in blue-eyed individuals, had an inhibitory effect
on OCA2 promoter activity. In the 3-generation Danish family, blond hair
color was associated with lighter brown/blue eyes and brown hair color
was associated with brown eyes. Hair color also associated with several
SNPs in the HERC2 gene. However, linkage analysis also implicated a
region associated with hair color on chromosome 14 (lod score of 4.21 at
D14S72), close to the RABGGTA gene (601905).

Donnelly et al. (2012) genotyped 3,432 individuals from 72 populations
for 21 SNPs in the OCA2-HERC2 region, and found that blue-eye-associated
alleles in all 3 haplotypes that previously had been associated with eye
pigmentation in Europeans occurred at high frequencies in Europe;
however, 1 was restricted to Europe and surrounding regions, whereas the
other 2 were found at moderate to high frequencies throughout the world.
Their data suggested that the TG allele of the haplotype restricted to
Europe, consisting of the SNPs dbSNP rs1129038 and dbSNP rs12913832 and
which they designated 'BEH2,' was the best marker for blue eyes.

- Autosomal Recessive Mental Retardation 38

In 7 patients of Amish or mixed Amish/Mennonite descent with autosomal
recessive mental retardation-38 (MRT38; 615516), Puffenberger et al.
(2012) identified a homozygous missense mutation in the HERC2 gene
(P594L; 605837.0004). The mutation was found by a combination of
homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing. Cellular transfection studies
showed that the mutant protein was less stable than wildtype and had a
diffuse cytosolic localization with the formation of abnormal
aggregates. Decreased abundance and/or activity of HERC2 could produce a
toxic loss of E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, leading to decreased
degradation of ARC (612461) and decreased postsynaptic glutamatergic
AMPA receptor density. Puffenberger et al. (2012) noted that this
pathophysiologic mechanism is similar to that thought to underlie
Angelman syndrome (105830), which results from loss of function of the
UBE3A gene (601623) on chromosome 15q11. The individuals with MRT38 had
some features similar to those of AS.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SKIN/HAIR/EYE PIGMENTATION 1, BLUE/NONBLUE EYES
SKIN/HAIR/EYE PIGMENTATION 1, BLOND/BROWN HAIR, INCLUDED
HERC2, IVS4, A/G

In a discovery sample of 2,986 Icelanders and replication samples of
2,718 Icelanders and 1,214 Dutch, Sulem et al. (2007) found association
of the A allele of dbSNP rs1667394 with blue versus brown eyes (OR =
35.42, P = 1.4 x 10(-124)), with blue versus green eyes (OR = 7.02, P =
5.1 x 10(-25)), and with blond versus brown hair (OR = 5.62, P = 4.4 x
10(-16)). Although the dbSNP rs1667394 variant resides in the HERC2
gene, Sulem et al. (2007) considered it unlikely that the association
signal provided by this SNP was due to a functional effect on HERC2.
Because of the established relationship between the OCA2 gene (611409)
and blue eye color and lighter hair and skin tones (227220), the authors
suggested that perhaps sequence variation in the introns of HERC2
affects the expression of OCA2, or that functional variants exist within
OCA2 that correlate with dbSNP rs1667394.

.0002
SKIN/HAIR/EYE PIGMENTATION 1, BLUE/NONBLUE EYES
HERC2, IVS12, C/T

In 3 independent genomewide association studies of a total of 1,406
persons and a genomewide linkage study of 1,292 relatives, all from the
Netherlands, Kayser et al. (2008) found that the HERC2 variant dbSNP
rs916977 showed a gradient-wise (clinal) allele distribution across 23
European populations that was significantly correlated to iris color
variation (227220), with the C allele, associated with blue eyes, being
more common in northern Europe and the T allele, associated with brown
eyes, more common in southern Europe. Analysis of dbSNP rs916977
together with the 3 SNPs in intron 1 of the OCA2 gene identified by
Duffy et al. (2007) (611409.0013) revealed significant genomewide
association for only the HERC2 SNP (P = 3.53 x 10(-18)).

.0003
SKIN/HAIR/EYE PIGMENTATION 1, BLUE/NONBLUE EYES
HERC2, IVS86, C/T

In a study of the association with eye color (227220) with
haplotype-tagging SNPs proximal to intron 1 of the OCA2 gene (611409)
that span the intergenic region and encompass the 3-prime end of the
upstream gene HERC2, Sturm et al. (2008) identified a SNP in intron 86
of HERC2, dbSNP rs12913832, that was strongly associated with eye color
in 3011 European individuals (P = 2 x 10(-78)). Individuals carrying the
CC genotype had only a 1% probability of having brown eyes, while those
with the TT genotype had an 80% probability. Haplotype analysis
combining the 3 SNPs in OCA2 identified by Duffy et al. (2007)
(611409.0013) with dbSNP rs12913832 followed by multiple ordinal
logistic regression showed that the HERC2 SNP alone was the best
predictor of eye color. Sturm et al. (2008) concluded that the conserved
region around dbSNP rs12913832 represents a regulatory region
controlling constitutive expression of OCA2, and that the C allele of
dbSNP rs12913832 leads to decreased expression of OCA2, particularly
within iris melanocytes, by abrogation of the binding site for HLTF
(603257) that regulates transcription of OCA2. Sturm et al. (2008) also
demonstrated that the OCA2 coding SNP R419Q (611409.0012) acts as a
penetrance modifier of dbSNP rs12913832.

In a 3-generation Danish family segregating blue and brown eye color,
Eiberg et al. (2008) used fine mapping to identify a 166-kb candidate
region within the HERC2 gene. Further studies of SNPs within this region
among 144 blue-eyed and 45 brown-eyed individuals identified 2 SNPs,
dbSNP rs1129038 and the strongly conserved dbSNP rs12913832, that showed
significant associations with the blue-eyed phenotype (p = 6.2 x
10(-46)). A common founder haplotype containing these SNPs was
identified among blue-eyed persons from Denmark, Turkey, and Jordan. In
vitro functional expression studies in human colon carcinoma cells
showed that what the authors referred to as the 'G' allele of dbSNP
rs12913832, present in blue-eyed individuals, had an inhibitory effect
on OCA2 promoter activity.

MENTAL RETARDATION, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 38
HERC2, PRO594LEU

In 7 patients of Amish or mixed Amish/Mennonite descent with autosomal
recessive mental retardation-38 (MRT38; 615516), Puffenberger et al.
(2012) identified a homozygous c.1781C-T transition in the HERC2 gene,
resulting in a pro594-to-leu (P594L) substitution at a highly conserved
residue in the first RLD1 domain. The mutation was found by a
combination of homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing. The mutation
was not present in the dbSNP database or in 760 alleles from Amish and
Mennonite controls. Cellular transfection studies demonstrated that the
mutant protein was less stable than wildtype and showed diffuse
cytosolic localization with the formation of abnormal aggregates.
Decreased abundance and/or activity of HERC2 could produce a toxic loss
of E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, leading to decreased degradation of ARC
(612461) and decreased postsynaptic glutamatergic AMPA receptor density.
Puffenberger et al. (2012) noted that this pathophysiologic mechanism is
similar to that thought to underlie Angelman syndrome (105830), which
results from loss of function of the UBE3A gene (601623) on chromosome
15q11. The affected individuals with the HERC2 mutation had global
developmental delay and autistic features similar to Angelman syndrome;
they also had blue irides.

608057	TITLE *608057 DEOXYRIBONUCLEASE II BETA; DNASE2B
;;DNase II-BETA;;
DNASE2-LIKE ACID DNase; DLAD
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DLAD is a cation-independent acid endonuclease that shares homology with
deoxyribonuclease II (DNASE2; 126350). Unlike DNASE2, however, DLAD
shows a restricted tissue distribution.

CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences sharing similarity with
DNASE2, followed by 3-prime RACE of salivary gland RNA, Krieser et al.
(2001) cloned full-length DLAD, which they called DNase II-beta. The
deduced 357-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal signal sequence, a
signal peptide cleavage site, and a conserved active site. It shares 37%
amino acid identity with DNASE2. Northern blot analysis of salivary
gland detected a 2.1-kb transcript. Expression array analysis detected
highest expression in salivary gland, followed by lung, prostate, and
lymph node. Weak expression was detected in trachea and testis, and no
expression was detected in any other tissue examined. Northern blot
analysis of mouse tissues detected expression of a 1.6-kb Dlad
transcript only in liver. By 5-prime RACE of lymphoid and lung cell line
RNA, Krieser et al. (2001) identified a DLAD sequence containing exon 1
of the inactive UOX pseudogene (191540), which is located in tandem with
DLAD on chromosome 1, within the 5-prime untranslated region. By
database analysis, they found DLAD homologs in all mammals examined and
in C. elegans and Drosophila.

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to mouse Dlad,
followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE of lung cDNA, Shiokawa and Tanuma
(2001) cloned DLAD. The deduced protein contains 153 amino acids and
includes a conserved active site histidine. Northern blot analysis of
several tissues detected a 1.1-kb transcript only in lung. By genomic
sequence analysis and PCR, Shiokawa and Tanuma (2001) identified a
longer DLAD variant that encodes a deduced 361-amino acid protein with 5
putative N-glycosylation sites. The longer DLAD sequence shares 63.2%
and 65.1% amino acid identity with mouse and rat Dlad, respectively.
Shiokawa and Tanuma (2001) determined that the lung-specific DLAD mRNA
is transcribed from intron 2 through exon 6.

GENE FUNCTION

Krieser et al. (2001) detected DNase activity at acidic pH in human
saliva following immunodepletion of DNASE2. They attributed the residual
activity to DLAD.

Shiokawa and Tanuma (2001) characterized affinity-purified recombinant
DLAD. They observed endonuclease activity over a broad pH range, with
maximum activity at pH 4.8 to 5.6. The activity was independent of
divalent cations and chelating agents.

Nishimoto et al. (2003) found that DLAD mRNA is highly expressed in the
mouse lens, with expression level in the lens about 10 times higher than
that in the liver. DLAD mRNA levels in the mouse lens were low at
embryonic day 14.5, but much increased at the late stage of mouse
embryogenesis. DLAD mRNA was detected in human lens cells from patients
with senile cataracts. An epithelial cell line established from human
lens also expressed a significant level of DLAD mRNA. Little expression
of DLAD mRNA was found in the other types of cell lines.

GENE STRUCTURE

Krieser et al. (2001) and Shiokawa and Tanuma (2001) determined that the
DLAD gene contains 6 exons and lies in a head-to-head orientation with
the inactive UOX pseudogene. Krieser et al. (2001) determined that the
DLAD gene spans about 16.3 kb, while Shiokawa and Tanuma (2001)
determined that it spans about 18 kb. Shiokawa and Tanuma (2001) found
that the promoter region of the mouse Dlad gene contains no canonical
TATA or CAAT boxes.

MAPPING

By FISH, Krieser et al. (2001) mapped the DLAD gene to chromosome
1p22.3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Nishimoto et al. (2003) generated Dlad-null mice by gene targeting.
Their targeting vector deleted exons 3 and 4, as confirmed by Southern
hybridization, Northern blot analysis, and RT-PCR. Dlad-null mice were
born at the expected mendelian frequency, showed no gross developmental
abnormality other than cataract, and were fertile. The eyeballs of
Dlad-null mice were of normal morphology, with well-differentiated
mature lens fiber cells. Mature lens fiber cells did not contain
endoplasmic reticulum or mitochondria; however, undigested DNA was
identified in the epithelial layer and the nucleus. Newborn Dlad-null
mice showed weak but recognizable cataract that was enhanced with age.
Nishimoto et al. (2003) concluded that DLAD is responsible for the
degradation of nuclear DNA during lens cell differentiation and that if

607128	TITLE *607128 TRF1-INTERACTING ANKYRIN-RELATED ADP-RIBOSE POLYMERASE 2; TNKS2
;;TANKYRASE 2; TANK2;;
TNKL
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using the adaptor protein GRB14 (601524) in a yeast 2-hybrid screen,
Lyons et al. (2001) identified a partial TNKS2 clone within a human
liver cDNA library. They generated the full-length sequence by isolation
of a series of overlapping clones. The deduced 1,166-amino acid protein
has a calculated molecular mass of 130 kD. It shares approximately 83%
sequence identity with tankyrase-1 (TNKS; 603303), differing mainly in
the absence of a histidine/proline/serine-rich (HPS) domain. Both
proteins possess 24 ankyrin-type repeats, a sterile alpha motif, and a
C-terminal poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) homology domain. Critical
residues required for NAD+ binding and catalysis are entirely conserved.
Northern blot analysis detected strong expression of a 7-kb transcript
in skeletal muscle and placenta and moderate expression in leukocytes,
small intestine, ovary, testis, prostate, thymus, spleen, and pancreas.
Western blot analysis of prostate carcinoma cells revealed a protein
with an apparent molecular mass of 130 kD. Fractionation of a fibroblast
cell line followed by Western blot analysis revealed both TNKS2 and TNKS
in the low density microsome fraction. Confocal microscopy demonstrated
both diffuse and punctate cytoplasmic staining for TNKS2, with some
overlap with GRB14.

Using the telomeric repeat-binding factor-1 (TRF1; 600951) as probe,
Kaminker et al. (2001) isolated a partial TNKS2 cDNA in a yeast 2-hybrid
screen of a fibroblast library and attained the full-length clone by
5-prime RACE. The human and mouse TNKS2 proteins share 96% sequence
identity. In place of the HPS domain in TNKS, human TNKS2 contains a
unique 25-amino acid N-terminal domain. Northern blot analysis detected
ubiquitous expression of a 6.6-kb transcript, at varying levels. TNKS2
was found in an insoluble fraction when cells were extracted under
nondenaturing conditions, suggesting that the protein associates with
insoluble nuclear or cytoskeletal matrices. In mitotic cells, TNKS2
localized to the pericentriolar matrix.

GENE FUNCTION

Using deletion analysis with a yeast 2-hybrid binding assay, Lyons et
al. (2001) determined that the N-terminal set of ankyrin repeats in
TNKS2 interacts with the N terminus of GRB14. By coimmunoprecipitation
experiments, they confirmed interaction between TNKS2 and GRB14 in
transfected HEK293 cells.

By coimmunoprecipitation and binding studies of in vitro translated
protein, Kaminker et al. (2001) verified TRF1/TNKS2 interaction and
localized the site of interaction to a 52-amino acid N-terminal domain
of TRF1. They also found that overexpression of TNKS2 is cytotoxic,
causing loss of mitochondrial membrane potential within 7 hours of
transfection. Addition of a PARP inhibitor partially protected cells
from TNKS2 toxicity.

In an immunoscreen of novel antigens associated with meningioma, Monz et
al. (2001) found that sera of patients with the most common types of
meningioma recognized TNKS2. Northern blot analysis demonstrated
expression of TNKS2 in 2 common-type meningiomas from patients with
immune response, but Monz et al. (2001) were unable to correlate
expression of TNKS2 to the immune response.

To investigate a role for TNKS2 at telomeres, Cook et al. (2002)
subjected TNKS2 to an in vitro PARP assay. TNKS2 poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated
itself and TRF1. Overexpression of TNKS2 in the nucleus released
endogenous TRF1 from telomeres. These findings established TNKS2 as a
bona fide PARP, with itself and TRF1 as acceptors of ADP-ribosylation,
and suggested the possibility of a role for TNKS2 at telomeres. Using
Northern blot analysis, Cook et al. (2002) detected TNKS2 expression
nearly ubiquitously in human adult and fetal tissues, in HeLa cells, and
in primary fibroblasts.

Sbodio et al. (2002) showed that tankyrase-2 contains intrinsic PARP
activity and, like tankyrase-1, binds to both TRF1 and IRAP (151300).
Intrinsic PARP activity of tankyrase-2 depends critically on the met1054
residue. Sequence analysis suggested that the ANK domain of tankyrases
comprises 5 subdomains, each consisting of 4 ANK repeats and demarcated
from its adjacent subdomain by an LLEAAR-containing insert, that provide
redundant binding sites for IRAP. Moreover, tankyrase-2 associates and
colocalizes with tankyrase-1, suggesting that both tankyrases might
function as a complex. Taken together, the findings of Sbodio et al.
(2002) indicated that tankyrase-1 and tankyrase-2 interact with the same
set of proteins and probably mediate overlapping functions, both at
telomeres and in vesicular compartments.

To examine whether tumors overexpress tankyrase-2, Sidorova et al.
(2006) raised anti-TNKL antibodies that did not cross-react with
tankyrase-1. Of 18 breast tumor sections, 2 were positive for TNKL.
Others were negative or contained barely detectable protein. Surrounding
normal tissues were negative. Immunostaining with anti-TNKL antibody
revealed expression of TNKL protein in epithelial cells of a limited
number of normal renal tubules, whereas other renal tubules were
negative. These data suggested that TNKL is not expressed ubiquitously
in human tissues. To determine whether the upregulation of TNKL is
associated with tissue regeneration and cell proliferation, Sidorova et
al. (2006) compared the activity and concentration of the enzyme in a
model HEK293 cell line arrested by serum deprivation and restimulated
with serum. The serum-starved quiescent cell culture exhibited
detectable protein as did the proliferating cells; enzyme activity
dramatically increased in the latter. Sidorova et al. (2006) concluded
that pathologic overexpression of TNKL in some tumors may be the result
of the cancer-related adaptation of the malignant cells dependent on
tankyrase activity. Under normal conditions, the protein might be
upregulated during cell differentiation and also posttranslationally in
proliferating cells.

Huang et al. (2009) used a chemical genetic screen to identify a small
molecule, XAV939, which selectively inhibits beta-catenin
(116806)-mediated transcription. XAV939 stimulates beta-catenin
degradation by stabilizing axin (603816), the concentration-limiting
component of the destruction complex. Using a quantitative chemical
proteomic approach, Huang et al. (2009) found that XAV939 stabilizes
axin by inhibiting the poly-ADP-ribosylating enzymes tankyrase-1
(603303) and tankyrase-2. Both tankyrase isoforms interact with a highly
conserved domain of axin and stimulate its degradation through the
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kaminker et al. (2001) determined that the TNKS2 gene contains 27 exons
and spans about 66 kb.

MAPPING

By FISH, Lyons et al. (2001) mapped the TNKS2 gene to chromosome
10q23.2. Kaminker et al. (2001) mapped the TNKS2 gene to chromosome
10q23-q24 by FISH and refined the localization to 10q23.3 by radiation
hybrid analysis.

176871	TITLE *176871 EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 2-ALPHA KINASE 2; EIF2AK2
;;PROTEIN KINASE, INTERFERON-INDUCIBLE DOUBLE-STRANDED RNA-ACTIVATED;
PRKR;;
PKR;;
p68 KINASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

EIF2AK2 is a protein serine/threonine kinase that acquires enzymatic
activity following autophosphorylation, a process mediated by
double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Activation of EIF2AK2 allows the kinase to
phosphorylate its natural substrate, the alpha subunit of eukaryotic
protein synthesis initiation factor-2 (EIF2-alpha; 603907), leading to
the inhibition of protein synthesis (summary by Kuhen et al., 1996).

CLONING

Meurs et al. (1990) cloned EIF2AK2, which encodes a 550-amino acid
protein with a predicted molecular mass of 62 kD. Immunoblot assay of
interferon-treated human Daudi and murine L929 cells identified a 68-kD
protein in human cells and a 65-kD protein in mouse cells. Transcription
of EIF2AK2 was induced following exposure to interferon (IFNG; 147570)
in a dose-dependent manner and was not affected by inhibition of protein
synthesis.

Kuhen et al. (1996) isolated the EIF2AK2 gene, which they called PKR, as
lambda phage and P1 phage clones from a human genomic library, and
compared the structural organization of the mouse and human genes. The
human and mouse proteins shared approximately 60% amino acid identity.
Kuhen et al. (1996) determined the nucleotide sequence of the human
EIF2AK2 gene, which encodes a 551-amino acid protein.

Jeon et al. (2012) reported that PKR contains 2 N-terminal dsRNA-
binding motifs and a long C-terminal kinase domain.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kuhen et al. (1996) determined that the EIF2AK2 gene contains 17 exons
and spans approximately 50 kb.

MAPPING

Barber et al. (1993) mapped the EIF2AK2 gene to chromosome 2p21 by in
situ hybridization. The corresponding mouse gene was mapped to
chromosome 17 (band E2) by the same method. By FISH analysis, Squire et
al. (1993) assigned the EIF2AK2 gene to the boundary between chromosome
2p22-p21.

GENE FUNCTION

Ben-Asouli et al. (2002) showed that human gamma-interferon mRNA uses
local activation of PKR in the cell to control its own translation
yield. IFNG mRNA was found to activate PKR through a pseudoknot in its
5-prime untranslated region. Mutations that impaired pseudoknot
stability reduced the ability to activate PKR and strongly increased the
translation efficiency of IFNG mRNA. Nonphosphorylatable mutant
eIF2-alpha (eIF2A; 609234), knockout of PKR, and the PKR inhibitors
2-aminopurine, transdominant-negative PKR, or vaccinia E3L
correspondingly enhanced translation of IFNG mRNA. The potential to form
the pseudoknot was found to be phylogenetically conserved. Ben-Asouli et
al. (2002) proposed that the RNA pseudoknot acts to adjust translation
of IFNG mRNA to the PKR level expressed in the cell.

Taylor et al. (1999) studied the mechanism underlying the resistance of
hepatitis C virus (HCV) to interferon. They demonstrated that the HCV
envelope protein E2 contains a sequence identical with phosphorylation
sites of the interferon-inducible protein kinase PKR and the translation
initiation factor EIF2-alpha, a target of PKR. E2 inhibited the kinase
activity of PKR and blocked its inhibitory effect on protein synthesis
and cell growth. This interaction of E2 in PKR may be one mechanism by
which HCV circumvents the antiviral effect of interferon. Taylor et al.
(1999) hypothesized that another potential outcome of PKR inhibition is
the promotion of cell growth which may contribute to HCV-associated
hepatocellular carcinoma.

Huntington disease (143100) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a
trinucleotide repeat expansion within the huntingtin gene (613004),
resulting in generation of a polyglutamine tract in the protein product.
Peel et al. (2001) showed that PKR preferentially bound mutant
huntingtin RNA transcripts immobilized on streptavidin columns that had
been incubated with human brain extracts. Immunohistochemical studies
demonstrated that PKR was present in its activated form in both human
Huntington autopsy material and brain tissue derived from Huntington
yeast artificial chromosome transgenic mice. The increased
immunolocalization of the activated kinase was more pronounced in areas
most affected by the disease. The authors suggested a role for PKR
activation in the Huntington disease process.

Gale et al. (1998) showed that P58(IPK) (601184) is inhibited through a
direct interaction with P52(rIPK) (607374), which in turn results in
upregulation of PKR activity. Gale et al. (1998) concluded that their
data described a protein kinase-regulatory system that encompasses an
intersection of interferon-, stress-, and growth-regulatory pathways.

PKR, which is involved in TLR signaling and mediates apoptosis in
fibroblasts in response to viral infection and inflammatory cytokines,
also activates IKK (see 600664) and NFKB (see 164011), thereby
suppressing apoptosis. To determine the role of PKR in macrophage
apoptosis, Hsu et al. (2004) examined its regulation and found that both
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and poly(IC) activate PKR dependent on the
presence of TRIF (607601). Macrophages lacking PKR had normal activation
of p38 (MAPK14; 600289) and IKK as well as other NFKB target genes in
response to LPS, but exhibited defective STAT1 (600555) phosphorylation
and failed to undergo apoptosis, independent of the presence of IFNB
(147640). They observed that apoptosis induced by live pathogenic
gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria required both TLR4 (603030) and
PKR, possibly representing a major mechanism for pathogenic bacteria
that use specific virulence factors to avoid detection and destruction
by the innate immune system. Hsu et al. (2004) proposed that TLR4
activates PKR and triggers apoptosis through TRIF and TRAM (608321)
adaptor proteins and that inhibition of PKR may augment
macrophage-mediated antibacterial responses.

Zhang et al. (2004) used immunoprecipitation and reconstituted kinase
assays to show that the FANCC (227645), FANCA (607139), and FANCG
(602956) proteins functionally interacted with and inhibited PKR in bone
marrow cells. PKR showed strongest binding to the FANCC protein. PKR
activity was increased in bone marrow cells of patients with Fanconi
anemia (FA; 227650) with mutations in the FANCC, FANCA, or FANCG genes.
All 3 of these cell lines showed significant increases in PKR bound to
the FANCC protein, which correlated with increased PKR activation. The
cells also showed hypersensitivity to growth repression mediated by
IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha (191160). Forced expression of a patient-derived
FANCC mutation increased PKR activation and cell death. Zhang et al.
(2004) concluded that FA mutations cause increased binding of PKR to
FANCC and increased PKR activation, leading to growth inhibition of
hematopoietic progenitors and bone marrow failure in Fanconi anemia.

Nallagatla et al. (2007) reported that RNAs with very limited secondary
structures activate PKR in a 5-prime-triphosphate-dependent fashion in
vitro and in vivo. Activation of PKR by 5-prime-triphosphate RNA is
independent of RIG1 (ROBO3; 608630) and is enhanced by treatment with
type I interferon (IFNA; 147660). Surveillance of molecular features at
the 5-prime end of transcripts by PKR presents a means of allowing
pathogenic RNA to be distinguished from self-RNA. Nallagatla et al.
(2007) concluded that this form of RNA-based discrimination may be a
critical step in mounting an early immune response.

To be effective, PKR must recognize a conserved substrate (eIF2A;
609234) while avoiding rapidly evolving substrate mimics such as the
poxvirus-encoded K3L. Using the PKR-K3L system and a combination of
phylogenetic and functional analyses, Elde et al. (2009) uncovered
evolutionary strategies by which host proteins can overcome viral
mimicry. Elde et al. (2009) found that PKR has evolved under intense
episodes of positive selection in primates. The ability of PKR to evade
viral mimics is partly due to positive selection at sites most
intimately involved in eIF2A recognition. They also found that adaptive
changes on multiple surfaces of PKR produce combinations of
substitutions that increase the odds of defeating mimicry. Elde et al.
(2009) concluded that, although it can seem that pathogens gain
insurmountable advantages by mimicking cellular components, host factors
such as PKR can compete in molecular 'arms races' with mimics because of
evolutionary flexibility at protein interaction interfaces challenged by
mimicry.

Using HCT116 human colon carcinoma cells and mouse embryo fibroblasts,
Yoon et al. (2009) found PKR mRNA and protein were upregulated by p53
(TP53; 191170) and by genotoxic stress, which induces p53 expression.
Deletion analysis and DNase footprinting revealed 2 half-sites for p53
binding within the PKR promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays,
chromatin immunoprecipitation, and reporter gene assays revealed direct
p53 binding to these sites, with activation of the PKR promoter. Binding
and activation of PKR by p53 was independent of interferon binding. In
response to genotoxic stress, cytoplasmic PKR was largely phosphorylated
and was associated with the phosphorylation and activation of
EIF2-alpha. Knockdown of either p53 or PKR abrogated all cellular
effects of genotoxic stress. PKR also played a role in p53-mediated
inhibition of translation, G2 arrest, and apoptosis following DNA
damage. Furthermore, knockdown of PKR in HCT116 cells and derived tumors
provided resistance to anticancer agents. Yoon et al. (2009) concluded
that PKR has a role in p53-mediated cellular responses to genotoxic
stress.

By studying HMGB1 (163905) release mechanisms, Lu et al. (2012)
identified a role for PKR in inflammasome activation. Exposure of
macrophages to inflammasome agonists induced PKR autophosphorylation.
PKR inactivation by genetic deletion or pharmacologic inhibition
severely impaired inflammasome activation in response to double-stranded
RNA, ATP, monosodium urate, adjuvant aluminum, rotenone, live E. coli,
anthrax lethal toxin, DNA transfection, and S. typhimurium infection.
PKR deficiency significantly inhibited the secretion of IL1-beta
(147720), IL18 (600953), and HMGB1 in E. coli-induced peritonitis. PKR
physically interacts with several inflammasome components, including
NLRP3 (606416), NLRP1 (606636), NLRC4 (606831), and AIM2 (604578), and
broadly regulates inflammasome activation. PKR autophosphorylation in a
cell-free system with recombinant NLRP3, ASC (PYCARD; 606838), and
pro-caspase-1 (147678) reconstituted inflammasome activity. Lu et al.
(2012) concluded that their results showed a crucial role for PKR in
inflammasome activation, and indicated that it should be possible to
pharmacologically target this molecule to treat inflammation.

Lee et al. (2011) found that the long noncoding RNA VTRNA2-1 (614938),
which they called pre-MIR886, directly bound to PKR in human cell lines
and inhibited its autoactivation. VTRNA2-1 was downregulated and PKR was
activated in a significant number of diverse cancer cell lines.
Knockdown of VTRNA2-1 resulted in PKR activation and PKR-dependent
phosphorylation of EIF2-alpha. PKR activation also independently induced
the NF-kappa-B pathway.

Kunkeaw et al. (2012) confirmed that VTRNA2-1, which they called NC886,
was a direct inhibitor of PKR. Knockdown of NC886 in nontransformed
cholangiocyte cells consistently activated the canonical PKR-EIF2-alpha
cell death pathway. However, in cholangiocarcinoma cells that either
lacked endogenous NC886 expression or in which NC886 expression was
knocked down, PKR activation frequently induced the NF-kappa-B cell
survival pathway. Kunkeaw et al. (2012) concluded that the effects of
NC886 downregulation or PKR activation depend on cellular context.

Jeon et al. (2012) found that a central region of NC886 stably
interacted with the 2 N-terminal dsRNA-binding motifs of PKR, with much
weaker binding to each motif individually. PKR bound preferentially to
NC886 in its slow-migrating conformation when the PKR-binding sequence
was single-stranded and sensitive to RNase digestion, but not when it
assumed a 4-nucleotide duplex structure. NC886 reciprocally competed
with double-stranded poly(I:C) for PKR binding. Because NC886 does not
show an extensive duplex region, Jeon et al. (2012) predicted that NC886
and dsRNAs bind PKR via different mechanisms. They hypothesized that
NC886 provides a threshold for PKR activation so that it occurs during
genuine viral infection and not in response to basal levels of cellular
dsRNA.

612609	TITLE *612609 LATE CORNIFIED ENVELOPE PROTEIN 2A; LCE2A
;;LATE ENVELOPE PROTEIN 9; LEP9
DESCRIPTION For background information on the LCE gene cluster, see 612603.

CLONING

By database analysis to identify human orthologs of mouse genes encoding
late envelope proteins (LEPs), Marshall et al. (2001) identified LCE2A,
which they called LEP9.

Using real-time PCR, Jackson et al. (2005) detected LCE2A expression in
human fetal, arm, penal, and abdominal skin. Much weaker expression was
detected in vulva, but not in tongue or esophagus.

GENE FUNCTION

Jackson et al. (2005) showed that expression of LCE2 genes, including
LCE2A, was upregulated in cultured normal human keratinocytes by both
ultraviolet irradiation and calcium.

GENE STRUCTURE

Jackson et al. (2005) determined that the LCE2A gene contains 2 exons.
Exon 1 is noncoding.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Marshall et al. (2001) mapped the LCE2A
gene within the LCE gene cluster on chromosome 1q21. Jackson et al.
(2005) stated that the mouse Lce2a gene maps to a syntenic LCE gene
cluster on chromosome 3F1.
