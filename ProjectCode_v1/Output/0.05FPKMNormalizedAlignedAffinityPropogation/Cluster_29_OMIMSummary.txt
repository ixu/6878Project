;;ZIC FAMILY MEMBER 1;;
ZIC
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In the mouse, Aruga et al. (1994) cloned a gene, which they named zic
(for zinc finger protein of the cerebellum), after screening a lambda
gt11 mouse cerebellar cDNA library. The putative open reading frame is
1,344 nucleotides encoding 447 amino acids and is preceded by 530
nucleotides of a 5-prime untranslated region. Northern blot
hybridization studies failed to demonstrate zic expression in any
tissues other than nervous tissue. Within the central nervous system,
the highest level of expression was in the cerebellum, whereas the
olfactory bulb, diencephalon, and brainstem showed only low levels of
zic expression. The zic gene has significant homology to the zinc finger
domain of the Caenorhabditis elegans tra1 gene, the Drosophila cubitus
interruptus dominant gene, and the human GLI oncogene (165220). In situ
hybridization demonstrated restricted expression of zic in granule cells
and their putative precursors. It is also expressed in the dorsal half
of the neural tube at early embryonic stages. Aruga et al. (1994)
speculated that zic encodes a nuclear factor involved in differentiation
in early development, as well as in the maintenance of the phenotypic
properties of the cerebellar granule cells.

The ZIC is a zinc finger protein that displays a highly restricted
expression pattern in the adult and developing mouse cerebellum and is
highly homologous to the Drosophila pair-rule gene Opa. To clarify the
mechanism for the development of the human cerebellum and the possible
involvement of ZIC in human nervous system diseases, Yokota et al.
(1996) isolated human ZIC cDNA and examined its expression by using
monoclonal antibody against recombinant ZIC protein. The nucleotide
sequence of human ZIC cDNA is 85% homologous to that the mouse zic gene.
Its putative amino acid sequence is highly conserved (more than 99%)
except for substitution of only 2 amino acid residues. The human ZIC
protein was immunohistochemically detected in the nuclei of the
cerebellar granule cell lineage from the progenitor cells of the
external germinal layer to the postmigrated cells of the internal
granular layer. Furthermore, ZIC protein was detected in medulloblastoma
(26 of 29 cases), whereas none of 70 other tumors examined, including
primitive neuroectodermal tumors, expressed this protein. These findings
suggested that ZIC is a potential biomarker for medulloblastoma as well
as the human cerebellar granule cell lineage.

Using a yeast 1-hybrid screen with the proximal region of the APOE
(107741) promoter as bait, Salero et al. (2001) isolated cDNAs encoding
the ZIC1 and ZIC2 (603073) transcription factors. Electrophoretic
mobility shift and mutational analyses identified binding sites in the
-136 to -125, -65 to -54, and -185 to -174 regions of the APOE promoter.
Luciferase reporter analysis showed that the ZIC proteins stimulate
potent transcriptional activation of APOE through these binding sites.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Yokota et al. (1996) mapped the
human ZIC gene to 3q24.

Dandy-Walker malformation (DWM; 220200) is a common but poorly
understood congenital cerebellar malformation in humans. Through mapping
of 3q2 interstitial deletions in several individuals with DWM, Grinberg
et al. (2004) defined the critical region associated with DWM,
encompassing 2 ZIC genes, ZIC1 and ZIC4 (608948). Mice with a
heterozygous deletion of these 2 linked genes were found to have a
phenotype that closely resembles DWM, providing a mouse model for this
malformation.

;;VASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL PROTEIN-TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE; VEPTP
DESCRIPTION For background information on protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases),
see 176884.

CLONING

By screening a human brainstem cDNA library with a leukocyte common
antigen (LCA, or PTPRC; 151460) probe spanning both conserved
cytoplasmic domains, Kaplan et al. (1990) isolated clones encoding the
alpha polypeptide (PTPRA; 176884) of the receptor-type PTPases, as well
as partial clones for 2 other tyrosine phosphatases, beta (PTPRB) and
gamma (PTPRG; 176886).

By screening a human placenta cDNA library with Drosophila Ptp, Krueger
et al. (1990) cloned several PTPases, including PTPRB, which they called
PTP-beta. The deduced 1,997-amino acid protein has an N-terminal signal
peptide, followed by an extracellular receptor-like domain, a
transmembrane segment, and a cytoplasmic region containing a
characteristic PTPase domain. The extracellular region contains 16
repeated fibronectin (FN1; 135600) type III domains of about 90 amino
acids each, followed by a putative proline-rich hinge region before the
transmembrane segment. Krueger et al. (1990) also identified a PTP-beta
splice variant predicted to alter the extracellular region of the
protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Using the cytoplasmic segment of human PTP-beta expressed in E. coli,
Krueger et al. (1990) confirmed that PTP-beta had robust PTPase activity
against phosphorylated test substrates.

MAPPING

Using a cDNA probe for in situ hybridization, Harder et al. (1992)
mapped the PTPRB gene to chromosome 12q15-q21.

ANIMAL MODEL

Dominguez et al. (2007) replaced mouse Veptp with a reporter gene and
found that Veptp was expressed in endothelium and in the developing
outflow tract of the heart, with later expression in developing heart
valves. Embryonic Veptp-null mice died due to a variety of angiogenic
defects in the embryo and yolk sac, including failure of remodeling of
the vascular plexus into large veins and branched vascular networks.
Dominguez et al. (2007) concluded that VEPTP is essential for
cardiovascular development and proposed that its continued expression in
adult mouse suggests that it may have a role in vascular homeostasis and
may be involved in pathologic angiogenesis of tumors.

;;COPPER METABOLISM MURR1 DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 5;;
HYPERTENSION-RELATED CALCIUM-REGULATED GENE; HCARG
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Solban et al. (2000) cloned rat Hcarg from a cDNA library constructed
from the spontaneously hypertensive rat parathyroid gland. The deduced
224-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of about 22.5 kD.
Hcarg has a 67% alpha helix content, a calcium-binding EF-hand motif, 4
putative leucine zipper motifs, a nuclear receptor-binding domain, and
no transmembrane domain. It also contains several putative
phosphorylation sites and an N-glycosylation site. Using rat Hcarg as
probe, Solban et al. (2000) cloned human HCARG from a vascular smooth
muscle cell cDNA library. The deduced 224-amino acid protein shares 80%
homology with rat Hcarg. Multiple-tissue expression array analysis
detected high expression in heart, stomach, jejunum, kidney, liver, and
adrenal gland. Expression was generally higher in adult organs than in
fetal tissues, particularly in heart, kidney, and liver. In situ
hybridization of rat tissues detected expression in the medulla and zona
fasciculata of the adrenal cortex and in the tubules of the kidney, but
showed no expression in renal glomeruli. Immunofluorescence microscopy
of transfected COS-7 cells and immunohistochemical staining of rat
pituitary detected Hcarg predominantly localized to the nucleus, with
some staining at sites of protein synthesis.

GENE FUNCTION

Solban et al. (2000) found that expression of Hcarg was higher in the
adrenal cortex and kidney tubules of hypertensive rats compared with
their normotensive controls. Rat Hcarg inhibited cell proliferation in
human embryonic kidney cells following transfection.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Solban et al. (2002) mapped the COMMD5
gene to chromosome 8q24.3.

173391	TITLE *173391 PLASMINOGEN ACTIVATOR RECEPTOR, UROKINASE-TYPE; PLAUR
;;UPA RECEPTOR; UPAR;;
CD87 ANTIGEN; CD87
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor is a key molecule in
the regulation of cell-surface plasminogen activation and, as such,
plays an important role in many normal as well as pathologic processes.

CLONING

Min et al. (1992) cloned the cDNA for Mo3, an activation antigen
expressed by human monocytes and myelomonocytic cell lines after
stimulation by a variety of agents. Mo3 expression in vivo is associated
predominantly with macrophages in inflammatory sites. It is a highly
glycosylated protein of about 50 kD in monocytes where it is anchored to
the plasma membrane by glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol linkage. The
complete coding sequence of the cDNA was found to encode 335 amino acids
including a predicted signal peptide of 22 residues and a hydrophobic
C-terminal portion. A database search revealed that Mo3 is identical to
the human receptor for the urokinase plasminogen activator (UPA, or
PLAU; 191840).

GENE FUNCTION

Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer and biochemical analysis,
Sitrin et al. (2001) demonstrated that PLAUR is directly associated with
the carbohydrate-binding domain of SELL (153240) in the membrane of
neutrophils, an association analogous to that between PLAUR and beta-2
integrins (see 600065). Spectrofluorometric analysis indicated that
PLAUR-mediated calcium mobilization is SELL dependent.

Foca et al. (2000) demonstrated that UPAR mRNA levels correlated with
the invasive potential of endometrial carcinomas and showed a 33-fold
increase in UPAR mRNA levels in advanced clinical stage endometrial
tumors compared with normal endometrial tissue. Furthermore, the
increase in UPAR mRNA levels correlated linearly with the progression of
disease stage. Memarzadeh et al. (2002) examined whether UPAR protein
expression correlated with (1) the grade and stage of endometrial cancer
and (2) recurrence and mortality rate in patients with endometrial
cancer. Their ultimate goal was to determine whether UPAR protein could
be used as a prognostic marker in patients with endometrial cancer. They
found no expression of UPAR protein in 7 patients with benign neoplasia
of the endometrium. On the other hand, UPAR protein expression highly
correlated with stage of disease in endometrial cancer. Moreover, high
UPAR expression positively correlated with grade of disease. It also
correlated positively with rate of recurrence and mortality in patients
with endometrial cancer. Memarzadeh et al. (2002) concluded that UPAR is
a useful prognostic marker for biologically aggressive forms of
endometrial cancer.

In human coronary artery vascular smooth muscle cells, UPA stimulates
cell migration via a UPAR signaling complex containing TYK2 (176941) and
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K; see 601232). Kiian et al. (2003)
showed that association of TYK2 and PI3K with active GTP-bound forms of
both RHOA (ARHA; 165390) and RAC1 (602048), but not CDC42 (116952), as
well as phosphorylation of myosin light chain (see 160781), are
downstream events required for UPA/UPAR-directed migration.

Wang et al. (2004) found that both Klf4 (602253) and Upar were
predominantly expressed in luminal surface epithelial cells of the
colonic crypt in mice. Colon cells from Klf4-null mice showed a dramatic
reduction in Upar protein compared with wildtype mice. Conversely, KLF4
expression in human colon cancer cells increased the amount of UPAR
protein and mRNA. Mobility shift experiments and chromatin
immunoprecipitation showed that KLF4 bound multiple regions of the UPAR
promoter.

Park et al. (2009) found that macrophages from Upar -/- mice had
enhanced ability to engulf wildtype neutrophils, but not Upar -/-
neutrophils. The enhanced phagocytic activity of Upar -/- macrophages
could be abrogated by incubation with soluble Upar, arg-gly-asp
peptides, or anti-integrin antibodies. Similarly, wildtype macrophages
showed increased uptake of Upar -/- neutrophils, except in the presence
of soluble Upar or anti-integrin antibodies. Incubation of either Upar
-/- neutrophils or Upar -/- macrophages, but not both, with soluble Upar
enhanced the uptake of Upar -/- neutrophils by Upar -/- macrophages.
Upar expression was reduced on the surface of apoptotic neutrophils
compared with viable neutrophils. Park et al. (2009) concluded that UPAR
is involved in the recognition and clearance of neutrophils.

- Role in Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis

Using quantitative RT-PCR with glomeruli isolated from human kidney
biopsies, Wei et al. (2008) found that expression of UPAR was low in
healthy glomeruli, but it was induced in glomeruli from individuals with
focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS; see 603278) and highly induced
in glomeruli from individuals with diabetic nephropathy. In all rat and
mouse models of proteinuria, Upar protein expression was increased in
glomerular cells, including podocytes, compared with controls.
Immunoelectron microscopy detected homogeneous distribution of Upar in
normal rat podocytes and mesangial and endothelial cells. However,
diabetic rats showed increased Upar labeling in all cells of the
glomerular tuft and increased podocyte Upar expression in basal
membranes of the foot process. Mice lacking Upar were protected from
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated proteinuria, but they developed
disease after expression of constitutively active beta-3 integrin
(ITGB3; 173470). Gene transfer studies revealed a prerequisite for Upar
expression in podocytes, but not in endothelial cells, for development
of LPS-mediated proteinuria. Upar was required to activate alpha-V
(ITGAV; 193210)/beta-3 integrin in podocytes, promoting cell motility
and activation of the small GTPases Cdc42 (116952) and Rac1 (602048).
Blockade of alpha-5/beta-3 integrin reduced podocyte motility in vitro
and lowered proteinuria in mice. Wei et al. (2008) concluded that UPAR
has a role in regulating renal permeability.

Wei et al. (2011) identified secreted PLAUR as a circulating factor
responsible for the development of FSGS. Levels of serum soluble PLAUR
were increased in two-thirds of patients with FSGS, but not in patients
with other glomerular disease. A higher serum concentration of PLAUR
before kidney transplantation was associated with an increased risk for
recurrence of FSGS after transplantation. Immunohistochemical studies on
human kidney samples derived from patients with FSGS demonstrated that
soluble PLAUR binds to and activates beta-3 integrin. In mouse models,
Plaur activated podocyte beta-3 integrin in both native and grafted
kidneys, causing foot process effacement, proteinuria, and FSGS-like
glomerulopathy. The findings suggested that renal disease only develops
when Plaur sufficiently activates podocyte beta-3-integrin. Inhibition
of PLAUR resulted in a reduction of beta-integrin activity in podocytes,
and plasmapheresis in humans reduced serum PLAUR concentrations in some
patients with increased levels. Wei et al. (2011) concluded that
pharmacologic modulation of excessive podocyte beta-3 integrin
activation may be a target for management of this form of renal disease.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Huai et al. (2006) reported the crystal structure at 1.9 angstroms of
the urokinase receptor complexed with the urokinase amino-terminal
fragment and antibody against the receptor. The 3 domains of the
urokinase receptor form a concave shape with a central cone-shaped
cavity where the urokinase fragment inserts. Huai et al. (2006)
concluded that the structure provides insight into the flexibility of
the urokinase receptor that enables its interaction with a wide variety
of ligands and a basis for the design of urokinase-urokinase receptor
antagonists.

MAPPING

By hybridization of a cDNA probe to DNAs from a panel of somatic cell
hybrids, Borglum et al. (1991, 1992) mapped the gene for the
urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor to 19q13-qter. Using RFLPs
related to the clone, they did linkage studies in 40 CEPH families and
demonstrated localization in the 19q13.1-q13.2 region. By in situ
hybridization, Vagnarelli et al. (1992) localized the PLAUR gene to
19q13.

ANIMAL MODEL

Powell et al. (2001) reported that Plaur knockout mice (Dewerchin et al.
(1996)) exhibit deficient scatter activity in the forebrain, abnormal
interneuron migration from the ganglionic eminence, and reduced
interneurons in the frontal and parietal cortex. Using immunoblots and
scatter assays, they concluded that the forebrain of Plaur knockout mice
has reduced levels of biologically active HGF (142409).

Stimulation with either gram-negative or gram-positive bacteria induces
upregulation of UPAR on monocytes and neutrophils. In general,
gram-negative bacterial stimuli require the beta-2 integrin CD11B/CD18B
for neutrophil emigration, whereas gram-positive bacteria do not.
Rijneveld et al. (2002) generated mice deficient in Upa or Upar.
Intranasal exposure to a beta-2 integrin-dependent pathogen,
Streptococcus pneumoniae, resulted in locally elevated levels of Upa in
wildtype mouse lungs. In Upar -/- mice, there was less granulocyte
accumulation but more bacteria in lungs, as well as reduced survival,
compared with wildtype mice. In contrast, Upa -/- mice manifested
increased neutrophil influx and fewer pneumococci in the lungs.
Rijneveld et al. (2002) concluded that UPAR is necessary for adequate
neutrophil recruitment into alveoli and lungs during pneumonia caused by
S. pneumoniae.

607204	TITLE *607204 PUMILIO, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 1; PUM1
;;KIAA0099
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing cDNAs randomly selected from a cDNA library derived from
the human immature myeloid cell line KG-1, Nagase et al. (1995) isolated
a cDNA encoding PUM1, a human homolog of the Drosophila Pumilio protein,
which they designated KIAA0099. The predicted 1,186-amino acid KIAA0099
protein is 42.1% identical to Drosophila Pumilio over an 875-amino acid
region . Northern blot analysis detected expression of KIAA0099 in all
tissues tested.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Wang et al. (2002) determined the structure of the RNA-binding domain of
human PUM1 bound to a high-affinity RNA ligand. The RNA binds the
concave surface of the molecule, where each of the protein's 8 repeats
makes contact with a different RNA base via 3 amino acid side chains at
conserved positions. Wang et al. (2002) mutated these 3 side chains in 1
repeat, thereby altering the sequence specificity of PUM1. They
concluded that the high affinity and specificity of the PUM homology
domain for RNA is achieved using multiple copies of a simple repeated
motif.

MAPPING

By analysis of human/rodent hybrid cell lines, Nagase et al. (1995)
mapped the KIAA0099 gene to chromosome 1.

607533	TITLE *607533 DIS3 MITOTIC CONTROL, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; DIS3
;;RIBOSOMAL RNA-PROCESSING PROTEIN 44, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; RRP44;;
KIAA1008
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The RNA exosome is an approximately 400-kD multimeric ribonucleolytic
complex that participates in both endonucleolytic and 3-prime/5-prime
exonucleolytic activity in RNA processing and in the degradation of a
variety of RNA substrates. DIS3 is a catalytic subunit that has both
endonucleolytic and 3-prime/5-prime exonucleolytic activity (summary by
Tomecki et al., 2010).

CLONING

By randomly sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain
cDNA library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned DIS3, which they designated
KIAA1008. The deduced 928-amino acid protein shares 44.5% identity with
the mitotic control protein Dis3 of S. pombe. PCR-ELISA detected low to
moderate expression in all tissues and brain regions tested, with
highest expression in testis and moderate expression in kidney, ovary,
corpus callosum, spinal cord, and fetal brain.

By sequence analysis of chromosome 13q21-q22 to identify a breast cancer
susceptibility gene, Rozenblum et al. (2002) identified DIS3. The
deduced protein contains 958 amino acids. Northern blot analysis
detected ubiquitous expression.

By searching a human EST database for sequences similar to yeast Dis3,
Tomecki et al. (2010) identified DIS3. The deduced 958-amino acid
protein contains a well conserved N-terminal PIN domain, followed by 2
cold-shock domains, an RNB exonuclease catalytic domain, and a
C-terminal S1 domain. DIS3 localized predominantly to the nucleus in
HEK293 and HeLa cells, with exclusion from nucleoli.

GENE FUNCTION

Tomecki et al. (2010) found that epitope-tagged human DIS3 or DIS3L
(614183) coimmunoprecipitated with core exosome subunits from
transfected HEK293 cells. Depletion of DIS3 or RRP6 (EXOSC10; 605960)
from HeLa cells resulted in the accumulation of nuclear 5.8 rRNA
precursors, an effect that was exacerbated by RRP6/DIS3 double
knockdown. Double depletion also resulted in partial stabilization of
cytoplasmic MYC (190080) mRNA. DIS3 purified from transfected HEK293
cells showed 3-prime/5-prime exonuclease activity against
single-stranded RNA and endonuclease activity against a circular RNA
substrate. Domain analysis revealed that the PIN and RNB domains of DIS3
conferred endonuclease and exonuclease activity, respectively.
Expression of human DIS3 could partially complement Dis3 depletion in
yeast.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rozenblum et al. (2002) determined that the DIS3 gene contains 21 exons
and spans 26.5 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Rozenblum et al. (2002) mapped the DIS3
gene to chromosome 13q21-q22.

604051	TITLE *604051 ENDO/EXONUCLEASE, ENDOG-LIKE; EXOG
;;ENDONUCLEASE G-LIKE 1; ENDOGL1;;
ENGL
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

EXOG is an endonuclease G (ENDOG; 600440)-like mitochondrial
endo/exonuclease that has both endonuclease and 5-prime-to-3-prime
exonuclease activities (Cymerman et al., 2008).

CLONING

By analysis of a 515-kb cloned segment from 3p22-p21.3, a region that is
commonly deleted in various carcinomas, Daigo et al. (1999) identified
10 genes, 4 of which were novel. They designated one of the novel genes
ENGL (endonuclease G-like) because the predicted 368-amino acid ENGL
protein shares 38% identity with endonuclease G (ENDOG; 600440).
Northern blot analysis revealed that ENGL was expressed as a 1.7-kb mRNA
in all tissues tested. An additional 2.1-kb mRNA, designated ENGLb, was
detected in heart, liver, skeletal muscle, and testis. The ENGLb
transcript contained all or part of 4 of the 6 ENGL exons, as well as a
3-prime exon not present in the genomic clone analyzed.

Cymerman et al. (2008) reported that the 368-amino acid EXOG protein has
a calculated molecular mass of 41.1 kD. It contains an N-terminal
mitochondrial leader sequence (MLS), a central catalytic ser-arg-gly-his
(SRGH) motif, and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain. A predicted helical
transmembrane segment is located within the MLS. Confocal
immunohistochemical analysis revealed that EXOG localized to
mitochondria in HeLa cells. Mitochondrial subfractionation, immunogold
electron microscopy, and confocal laser scanning microscopy showed that
EXOG localized specifically to the inner mitochondrial membrane.

GENE FUNCTION

By assaying transfected HEK293 cells, Cymerman et al. (2008) showed that
EXOG had high endonuclease activity against circular single-stranded
DNA. Recombinant EXOG lacking the N-terminal MLS showed a similar
preference for circular single-stranded DNA, but it also cleaved
super-coiled and open circular DNA after prolonged incubation. EXOG
showed 5-prime-to-3-prime exonuclease activity toward single- and
double-stranded DNA and single-stranded RNA. It showed little to no
endonuclease activity on ribosomal RNA substrates. Mutation of the
conserved his140 within the SRGH catalytic motif or removal of the
C-terminal coiled-coil domain abolished EXOG activity. Cymerman et al.
(2008) also found that a naturally occurring SNP resulting in a
gly277-to-val (G277V) substitution inactivated EXOG. Mutation analysis
showed that the transmembrane segment within the N-terminal MLS of EXOG
was required for EXOG mitochondrial localization.

GENE STRUCTURE

Daigo et al. (1999) determined that the EXOG gene contains 6 exons.
Cymerman et al. (2008) found that it spans 28.35 kb.

MAPPING

Daigo et al. (1999) identified the EXOG gene within a 515-kb cloned
segment from 3p22-p21.3. EXOG was the most telomeric gene in the cloned
region and was located next to the ActRIIB (ACVR2B; 602730) gene.
Cymerman et al. (2008) stated that the EXOG gene maps to chromosome
3p21.3.

613110	TITLE *613110 BLADDER CANCER-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; BLCAP
;;BLADDER CANCER-ASSOCIATED, 10-KD; BC10
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The BLCAP gene is a tumor suppressor that limits cell proliferation and
stimulates apoptosis. BLCAP protein or message is downregulated or
absent in a variety of human cancers (Schulz et al., 2009).

CLONING

Using differential display to identify genes upregulated in tumor
biopsies obtained from a noninvasive compared with invasive bladder
transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs), Gromova et al. (1999) identified
BLCAP, which they designated BC10. Gromova et al. (2002) cloned
full-length BC10 from a cDNA library developed from a noninvasive TCC.
The deduced 87-amino acid peptide has a calculated molecular mass of 9.8
kD. It has an N-terminal cytoplasmic region, followed by a proline-rich
region with characteristics of the SRC (190090) homology-3
domain-binding site, 2 highly hydrophobic regions, and a C terminus with
a putative casein kinase II (see CSNK2A1, 115440) phosphorylation site.
Human and mouse BC10 share 100% amino acid identity, and the
corresponding transcripts share 95% nucleotide identity in the coding
region. Close orthologs were also detected in nematode and fly,
suggesting a high degree of conservation. Northern blot analysis
detected a transcript of about 2 kb in noninvasive TCC. Two-dimensional
separation of proteins in BC10-expressing COS cells, followed by Western
blot analysis, revealed a major acidic form of BC10, and a minor basic
form of BC10, both at an apparent molecular mass of 10 kD. The acidic
form is likely phosphorylated.

Schulz et al. (2009) identified at least 4 distinct human BLCAP
transcripts and 2 distinct mouse transcripts. They referred to BLCAP
transcripts with translation start sites downstream of NNAT (603106),
which is within intron 1 of BLCAP, as BLCAP-V1A, -V1B, and -V1C, and
they referred to the BLCAP transcript with translation start site
upstream of NNAT as BLCAP-V2A.

GENE FUNCTION

Using Northern blot analysis and RT-PCR, Gromova et al. (2002) confirmed
that the expression of BLCAP was downregulated in invasive bladder TCCs.

Yao et al. (2007) stated that expression of BLCAP is downregulated in
several types of carcinomas and overexpression of BLCAP in HeLa cells
induces apoptosis. They found that BLCAP overexpression in a human
tongue carcinoma cell line induced S phase arrest and apoptosis,
accompanied by upregulation of p21 (CDKN1A; 116899) and downregulation
of BCL2 (151430) and BCLXL (BCL2L1; 600039).

GENE STRUCTURE

Schulz et al. (2009) noted that the BLCAP gene consists of 2 exons
traversing approximately 13 kb, with evidence for 2 alternative exons
resulting in minor splice variants. In mouse and human, the first intron
of the BLCAP gene contains the distinct neuronatin (NNAT; 603106) gene,
which is an imprinted gene exclusively expressed from the paternally
inherited allele.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Gromova et al. (2002) mapped the BLCAP
gene to chromosome 20q11.2-q12.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Schulz et al. (2009) found that mouse Blcap-v1 transcripts were
preferentially expressed from maternally-inherited alleles in adult and
fetal brain but not in other murine tissues, and likewise human BLCAP-V1
transcripts showed similar preferential expression from
maternally-inherited alleles in adult and fetal brain. Mouse and human
BLCAP-V2A transcripts were found predominantly expressed from
paternally-inherited alleles in brain. They proposed that the
tissue-specific imprinting of BLCAP may be due to the particularly high
transcriptional activity of NNAT in brain. Schulz et al. (2009)
hypothesized that the imprinted expression of BLCAP and its interplay
with NNAT at the transcriptional level may be relevant to human
carcinogenesis.

600754	TITLE *600754 MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASE 14; MMP14
;;MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASE 14, MEMBRANE-TYPE;;
MEMBRANE-TYPE MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASE 1;;
MT1-MMP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are Zn(2+)-binding endopeptidases that
degrade various components of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The MMPs
are enzymes implicated in normal and pathologic tissue remodeling
processes, wound healing, angiogenesis, and tumor invasion. MMPs have
different substrate specificities and are encoded by different genes.
Sato et al. (1994) cloned a cDNA for the human gene from a placenta cDNA
library (they called the gene MMP-X1 and the gene product membrane-type
metalloproteinase). The authors noted that the protein was expressed at
the surface of invasive tumor cells. Using degenerate PCR, Takino et al.
(1995) cloned the entire genomic sequence of this member of the MMP
superfamily (see MMP1; 120353). The cDNA identified codes for a
582-amino acid protein which shared conserved sequence and a similar
domain structure to other MMPs. They noted that the cDNA, termed MMP-X1
by them, had a unique transmembrane domain at the C terminus. Thus, they
predicted that MMP-X1 was a membrane spanning protein rather than a
secretory protein like the other MMPs. Northern blots showed that MMP-X1
expression was present at varying intensity in almost all tissues
examined, but was highest in the placenta.

MAPPING

By isotopic in situ hybridization, Mignon et al. (1995) mapped the MMP14
gene to chromosome 14q11-q12.

GENE FAMILY

Mignon et al. (1995) tabulated 11 members of the matrix
metalloproteinase family and their chromosomal locations; with 1
exception, the genes encoding them had been mapped. Six of them,
including 3 collagenases and 2 stromelysins, had been assigned to 11q.

GENE FUNCTION

Mignon et al. (1995) stated that membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase
(MMP14) may be an activator of pro-gelatinase A (MMP2; 120360) and is
expressed in fibroblast cells during both wound healing and human cancer
progression.

Ueda et al. (2002) investigated survivin gene and protein expression in
a tumor-like benign disease, endometriosis, and correlated them with
apoptosis and invasive phenotype of endometriotic tissues. Gene
expression levels of survivin (603352), MMP2, MMP9 (120361), and MMP14
in 63 pigmented or nonpigmented endometriotic tissues surgically
obtained from 35 women with endometriosis were compared with those in
normal eutopic endometrium obtained from 12 women without endometriosis.
Survivin, MMP2, MMP9, and MMP14 mRNA expression levels in clinically
aggressive pigmented lesions were significantly higher than those in
normal eutopic endometrium, and survivin gene expression in pigmented
lesions was also higher than that in nonpigmented lesions (P less than
0.05). There was a close correlation between survivin and MMP2, MMP9,
and MMP14 gene expression levels in 63 endometriotic tissues examined (P
less than 0.01). The authors concluded that upregulation of survivin and
MMPs may cooperatively contribute to survival and invasion of
endometriosis.

Noda et al. (2003) studied MMPs and their activation in association with
the pathogenesis of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR; 603933).
They demonstrated that pro-MMP2 was efficiently activated in the
fibrovascular tissues of PDR, probably through interaction with MT1-MMP
and TIMP2 (188825). The results suggested that MMP2 and MT1-MMP may be
involved in the formation of the fibrovascular tissues.

Hotary et al. (2003) found that MT1-MMP conferred human tumor cell lines
with a 3-dimensional growth advantage in vitro and in vivo. The
replicative advantage conferred by MT1-MMP required pericellular
proteolysis of the extracellular matrix, as proliferation was suppressed
by protease-resistant collagen gels. In the absence of proteolysis,
tumor cells embedded in extracellular matrices were trapped in a
compact, spherical configuration and were unable to undergo changes in
cell shape or cytoskeletal reorganization required for 3-dimensional
growth.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a proband with Winchester syndrome (WNCHRS; 277950), originally
described by Winchester et al. (1969), Evans et al. (2012) identified a
homozygous missense mutation in the MMP14 gene (600754.0001). The
mutation, which occurred in the hydrophobic region of the signal
peptide, decreased MMP14 membrane localization with consequent
impairment of pro-MMP2 activation.

ANIMAL MODEL

By gene targeting, Holmbeck et al. (1999) generated mice deficient in
the Mmp14 gene, which they called MT1-MMP. Mmp14 deficiency caused
craniofacial dysmorphism, arthritis, osteopenia, dwarfism, and fibrosis
of soft tissues due to ablation of a collagenolytic activity that is
essential for modeling of skeletal and extraskeletal connective tissues.
These findings demonstrated the pivotal function of MMP14 in connective
tissue metabolism and illustrated that modeling of the soft connective
tissue matrix by resident cells is essential for the development and
maintenance of the hard tissues of the skeleton.

The MMP family, which has approximately 25 members in mammals, has been
implicated in extracellular matrix remodeling associated with embryonic
development, cancer formation and progression, and various other
physiologic and pathologic events. Oh et al. (2004) stated that at the
time of their report, inactivating mutations in individual matrix
metalloproteinase genes in mice were nonlethal, at least for the first
few weeks after birth, suggesting functional redundancy among MMP family
members. The authors reported that mice lacking 2 MMPs, a nonmembrane
type (MMP2; 120360) and a membrane type (MT1-MMP), die immediately after
birth with respiratory failure, abnormal blood vessels, and immature
muscle fibers reminiscent of central core disease (117000). In the
absence of Mmp2 and MT1-MMP, myoblast fusion in vitro was also
significantly retarded. These findings suggested functional overlap in
mice between the 2 MMPs with distinct molecular natures. Mutations in
both were synthetically lethal in mice.

Chun et al. (2006) showed that Mt1-mmp coordinated adipocyte
differentiation in mice. In the absence of Mt1-mmp, white adipose tissue
development was aborted, leaving tissues populated by mini-adipocytes
that rendered null mice lipodystrophic. Null preadipocytes were able to
differentiate into functional adipocytes in a 2-dimensional culture, but
not in a 3-dimensional gel.

In a proband with Winchester syndrome (WNCHRS; 277950), originally
described by Winchester et al. (1969), Evans et al. (2012) identified a
homozygous 284C-G transversion in the MMP14 gene, resulting in a
thr17-to-arg (T17R) substitution. The mutation, which occurred in the
hydrophobic region of the signal peptide, decreased MMP14 membrane
localization with consequent impairment of pro-MMP2 activation. The
mutation was not present in the dbSNP132 or 1000 Genomes databases or in
100 Puerto Rican control chromosomes.

612252	TITLE *612252 C-TYPE LECTIN DOMAIN FAMILY 9, MEMBER A; CLEC9A
;;DENDRITIC CELL NATURAL KILLER LECTIN GROUP RECEPTOR 1; DNGR1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CLEC9A is a group V C-type lectin-like receptor (CTLR) that functions as
an activation receptor and is expressed on myeloid lineage cells
(Huysamen et al., 2008).

CLONING

By sequence analysis of the dectin-1 (CLEC7A; 606264) cluster on
chromosome 12, Huysamen et al. (2008) identified CLEC9A. The predicted
type II transmembrane CTLR contains 241 amino acids and has a calculated
molecular mass of 30 kD. It has a C-type lectin domain (CTLD), followed
by a stalk region, the transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail with
an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM). The CTLD
contains 6 characteristic cysteines, but it lacks residues involved in
calcium ion coordination and carbohydrate binding. The stalk region has
2 cysteines and an N-linked glycosylation site. Flow cytometric, Western
blot, and deglycosylation analyses showed surface expression of a
glycosylated CLEC9A dimer of 40 and 45 kD under reducing conditions. The
deglycosylated dimer was approximately 30 and 35 kD. RT-PCR detected
CLEC9A expression in most human tissues examined, with highest levels in
brain, thymus, and spleen. Flow cytometric sorting and RT-PCR analysis
detected CLEC9A expression predominantly in BDCA3-positive dendritic
cells (DCs), but also in a monocyte subset. Huysamen et al. (2008) also
cloned mouse Clec9a, which shares 53% amino acid identity with human
CLEC9A. Mouse Clec9a was expressed at the cell surface, but unlike human
CLEC9A, it was not glycosylated and was expressed as a monomer.

GENE FUNCTION

Huysamen et al. (2008) expressed human CLEC9A in mouse fibroblasts and
macrophages and showed that crosslinking of CLEC9A led to receptor
internalization or endocytosis, but not phagocytosis. CLEC9A-positive
macrophages stimulated with zymosan expressed TNF (191160) via SYK
(600085). Huysamen et al. (2008) concluded that CLEC9A is an activation
receptor.

In mice, Sancho et al. (2008) showed that Clec9a, which they called
Dngr1, could deliver antigens to Cd8a (186910)-positive DCs for MHC
class I cross-presentation and promotion of tumor immunity. In humans,
they found that DNGR1 was an endocytic receptor expressed uniformly on
BDCA3-positive DCs.

Sancho et al. (2009) showed that CD8A-positive DCs use CLEC9A to
recognize a preformed signal that is exposed on necrotic cells. Loss or
blockade of CLEC9A did not impair the uptake of necrotic cell material
by CD8A-positive DCs, but specifically reduced crosspresentation of dead
cell-associated antigens in vitro and decreased the immunogenicity of
necrotic cells in vivo. The function of CLEC9A requires a key tyrosine
residue in its intracellular tail that allows the recruitment and
activation of the tyrosine kinase SYK (600085), which is also essential
for crosspresentation of dead cell-associated antigens. Thus, Sancho et
al. (2009) concluded that CLEC9A functions as a SYK-coupled C-type
lectin receptor to mediate sensing of necrosis by the principal DC
subset involved in regulating crosspriming to cell-associated antigens.

GENE STRUCTURE

Huysamen et al. (2008) determined that the CLEC9A gene contains 6 exons
and spans approximately 13 kb. Sancho et al. (2008) stated that CLEC9A
contains 9 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Huysamen et al. (2008) mapped the CLEC9A
gene to chromosome 12p13.31, centromeric to CLEC12B and telomeric to
CLEC1A (606782).

171835	TITLE *171835 6-@PHOSPHOFRUCTO-2-KINASE/FRUCTOSE-2,6-BISPHOSPHATASE 2; PFKFB2
;;PFKFB, CARDIAC
DESCRIPTION Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate is an intracellular regulatory molecule that
controls glycolysis in all eukaryotic tissues by integrating hormonal
and metabolic signals. The synthesis and degradation of fructose
2,6-bisphosphate are catalyzed by 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (EC
2.7.1.105) and fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (EC 3.1.3.46), respectively.
In liver, these 2 activities belong to the same polypeptide encoded by
the gene PFKFB1, which also encodes the muscle isozyme and is located on
the X chromosome (311790). The heart isozyme is encoded by a separate
gene, which Hilliker et al. (1991) showed, by means of probes generated
by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), to be located on 1q31 in the
human and 13q24-q25 in the rat. The mapping was done by analysis of
somatic cell hybrids and followed by in situ hybridization.

605842	TITLE *605842 TRANSDUCIN-BETA-LIKE 2; TBL2
;;WBSCR13
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Meng et al. (1998) constructed a physical map encompassing the 1.5-Mb
region of chromosome 7q11.23 that is commonly deleted in Williams-Beuren
syndrome (WBS; 194050). They identified 3 genes within this region,
including TBL2, which they designated WS-beta-TRP. By EST database
searching, screening of a testis cDNA library, and sequencing, they
cloned a TBL2 cDNA encoding a deduced 426-amino acid protein with 4 WD
(or beta-transducin) repeats. TBL2 shares approximately 40% homology
with a hypothetical C. elegans protein, suggesting that the gene has
been conserved throughout evolution. Northern blot analysis detected a
2.4-kb transcript in all tissues examined, with high expression in
heart, brain, placenta, skeletal muscle, and pancreas.

Perez Jurado et al. (1999) cloned a TBL2 cDNA from a fetal brain cDNA
library and found that it encodes a deduced 447-amino acid protein with
a predicted molecular mass of 49.8 kD. They also cloned the mouse
ortholog, which shares 84% sequence identity with the human protein.
Northern blot analysis of human tissues detected not only the 2.4-kb
transcript, but an approximately 5-kb transcript which was ubiquitously
expressed at lower levels. Perez Jurado et al. (1999) also identified an
alternatively spliced transcript containing an additional exon (exon
2-prime) with an in-frame stop codon that encodes a deduced 75-amino
acid protein with 43 amino acids identical to TBL2 at the N terminus and
no known functional domain.

GENE STRUCTURE

Perez Jurado et al. (1999) determined that the TBL2 gene spans 8.9 kb of
genomic DNA and contains 7 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Meng et al. (1998) identified the TBL2
gene on chromosome 7q11.23. Perez Jurado et al. (1999) mapped the mouse
Tbl2 gene to chromosome 5 in a region of conserved synteny with human
7q11.23.

614995	TITLE *614995 INTERLEUKIN 17 RECEPTOR E; IL17RE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

IL17RE, a member of the IL17R family (IL17RA, 605461; IL17RB, 605458:
IL17RC; 610925; and IL17RD, 606807), is involved in host mucosal defense
against infection. IL17RE is a receptor specific for IL17C (604628)
(Song et al., 2011).

CLONING

By RT-PCR analysis of mouse tissues, Song et al. (2011) detected high
levels of IL17re in colon, followed by kidney, cecum, and ileum.

Chang et al. (2011) detected increased binding of IL17C in embryonic
kidney cells transfected with IL17RE, but not other IL17Rs. Mouse Th17
cells express high levels of IL17re, dependent on the presence of Stat3
(102582), Rorc (602943), and Rora (600825). Expression was enhanced
after stimulation with IL6 (147620) and Tgfb (190180). IL17c-induced
expression of IL17a is dependent on the presence of both IL17ra and
IL17re as well as the adaptor protein Act1 (TRAF3IP2; 607043).

ANIMAL MODEL

In Il17re -/- mice, Song et al. (2011) observed weight loss, accompanied
by enlargement of spleen and intestine, high bacterial loads, and death
13 days after infection with Citrobacter rodentium. Infected mice
lacking IL17re have reduced levels of antibacterial peptides (e.g.,
S100A8, 123885; S100A9, 123886; and LCN2, 600181), proinflammatory
cytokines (TNF, 191160; IL1B, 147720), and chemokines (KC, 155730;
CXCL2, 139110; and CCL20, 601960). Wildtype mice express high levels of
IL17c and IL17f (606496) at day 4 after infection, whereas IL17a
(603149) is expressed late in infection at day 12. Exposure of wildtype,
but not IL17re-deficient, colonic epithelial cells (CEC) to IL17c
induced the expression of genes encoding antibacterial peptides.
Immunoprecipitation analysis showed interaction of IL17c with the
extracellular domains of IL17ra and IL17re but not with other IL17r
members. IL17ra and IL17re associate with each other; IL17c binds to the
heterodimeric receptor and activates downstream signaling. Exposure of
wildtype, but not IL17re -/-, CEC to IL17c and IL22 (605330), resulted
in synergistic induction of antibacterial peptides.

In mice with transgenic expression of Il17re in T cells, Chang et al.
(2011) observed increased susceptibility to experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE). They concluded that enhanced signaling of
IL17RE in CD4+ T cells leads to greater EAE disease as well as an
enhanced Th17 cell response and increased expression of IKBZ (NFKBIZ;
608004).

613482	TITLE *613482 CYCLIN L2; CCNL2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By randomly sequencing clones obtained from a human bone marrow stromal
cell cDNA library, followed by database analysis and PCR of a Raji
leukemia cell cDNA library, Yang et al. (2004) cloned CCNL2. The deduced
520-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 58.1 kD. CCNL2
has 2 cyclin domains and 2 putative transmembrane regions in its
N-terminal half, several arg/ser (RS) repeats in its C-terminal half,
and several nuclear localization signals. It shares 65% and 90% amino
acid identity with human CCNL1 (613384) and mouse Ccnl2, respectively.
Raji cell cDNA also contained a CCNL2 splice variant that encodes a
deduced 227-amino acid protein lacking the C-terminal RS motifs.
Northern blot analysis detected a transcript of about 5.0 kb in all
normal tissues analyzed, with highest expression in ovary, heart, liver,
and pancreas, and lower expression in spleen, colon, peripheral blood
leukocytes, lung, and skeletal muscle. RT-PCR detected CCNL2 in all
human hematopoietic cell lines and solid tumor cell lines examined.
Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that epitope-tagged CCNL2 localized
to the nucleus in transfected human hepatoma SMMC-7721 cells. CCNL2
showed both a generalized nucleoplasmic distribution and a punctate
distribution, where it colocalized in nuclear speckles with the splicing
factors SC35 (SFRS2; 600813) and 9G8 (SFRS7; 600572).

By screening a human fetal brain expression library for proteins that
bound to and were phosphorylated by the nuclear protein kinase DYRK1A
(600855), followed by database analysis, de Graaf et al. (2004)
identified 3 CCNL2 transcripts. The longest transcript, T1, is about 4.5
kb long and contains all CCNL2 exons, including the alternatively
spliced exon 6a, which introduces a stop codon. T1 encodes a truncated
CCNL2 protein lacking the RS domain of full-length CCNL2. The T2
transcript is about 2.4 kb long, lacks exon 6a, and encodes the
full-length CCNL2 protein. Transcript T3 is about 1.2 kb long, includes
an alternative polyadenylation signal in exon 6a, and lacks all further
exons. T3 and T1 encode identical truncated proteins. Using
exon-specific probes for Northern blot analysis, de Graaf et al. (2004)
found variable T1 expression in all tissues examined. T2 was
predominantly expressed in testis, and T3 was weakly expressed in almost
all tissues. PCR analysis gave similar results, with T1 and T3 highly
expressed in pancreas, and T2 highly expressed in testis.

Using Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses, Loyer et al. (2008) identified
5 distinct cyclin L2 splice variants that were variably expressed in a
tissue-dependent manner in human brain, liver, testis, spleen, and
thymus. The 5 variants have 3 distinct ORFs and encode the cyclin
L2-alpha, L2-beta-A, and L2-beta-B isoforms, which differ at their
C-terminal ends. Immunofluorescence analysis of several human cell lines
detected all cyclin L1 and L2 isoforms in both nucleoplasm and large
nuclear speckles and showed colocalization with the p110 isoform of
CDK11 (see CDK11A; 116951).

GENE FUNCTION

Using immunoprecipitation analysis, Yang et al. (2004) showed that CCNL2
interacted with the hyperphosphorylated form of RNA polymerase II (RNA
pol II; see 180660), with the p110 subunit of the cyclin-dependent
kinase PITSLRE (see 176873), and with the splicing factors SC35 and 9G8.
Mutation analysis revealed that the cyclin domains of CCNL2 associated
with RNA pol II and p110 PITSLRE, whereas the RS domain of CCNL2
associated with the splicing factors. Using HeLa cell nuclear extracts
in an in vitro splicing assay, Yang et al. (2004) showed that CCNL2
stimulated splicing activity. Overexpression of CCNL2 in SMMC-7721 cells
suppressed cell growth and induced apoptosis, which involved
upregulation of the apoptotic proteins p53 (TP53; 191170) and BAX
(600040) and downregulation of the antiapoptotic protein BCL2 (151430).
Injection of CCNL2 into SMMC-7721 tumors in nude mice inhibited tumor
growth and induced apoptotic changes.

Using FRAP analysis and live cell imaging, de Graaf et al. (2004) showed
that fluorescence-tagged CCNL2 localized transiently to nuclear speckles
in COS-7 cells. Full-length CCNL2, but not the isoform lacking the RS
domain, associated with DYRK1A in pull-down assays. CCNL2 also
interacted with DYRK2 (603496) and with p110 PITSLRE. In vitro
phosphorylation assays showed that DYRK1A phosphorylated CCNL2 on
ser330, ser338, and ser369, all of which are N-terminal to a proline
residue. De Graaf et al. (2004) concluded that CCNL2 is a highly mobile
component of nuclear speckles and that DYRK1A may regulate splicing by
phosphorylating CCNL2.

By immunoprecipitation analysis and protein pull-down assays with human
cell lines, Loyer et al. (2008) found that the alpha and beta isoforms
of cyclin L1 and L2, but not the gamma isoform of cyclin L1, interacted
with the p110 isoform of CDK11 in a high molecular mass complex that
showed splicing activity in vitro. The alpha isoforms of cyclin L1 and
L2 also interacted with the p58 and p46 isoforms of CDK11. In vivo
splicing assays showed that expression of cyclin L1-alpha, L1-beta,
L2-alpha, or L2-beta and/or p110 CDK11 increased intron-splicing
activity and altered alternative splice-site selection in a cyclin L1
and L2 isoform- and cell type-specific manner.

GENE STRUCTURE

De Graaf et al. (2004) determined that the CCNL2 gene contains at least
11 exons and spans about 13 kb. The alternatively spliced exon 6a
contains an alternative stop codon and polyadenylation site. The 3-prime
region of the CCNL2 gene contains 2 additional polyadenylation sites.

Loyer et al. (2008) stated that the CCNL2 gene contains 14 exons and
spans about 11.8 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, de Graaf et al. (2004) mapped the CCNL2
gene to chromosome 1p36.33.

Yang et al. (2004) mapped the mouse Ccnl2 gene to the low terminus of
chromosome 4.

194558	TITLE *194558 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 83; ZNF83
DESCRIPTION 
MAPPING

Marine et al. (1994) assigned the ZNF83 gene (also known as HPF1) to
chromosome 19 by screening a human/rodent hybrid panel and localized the
gene further to 19q13.3-q13.4 by fluorescence in situ hybridization and
digital imaging microscopy.

HISTORY

Conserved structural motifs define large families of nucleic acid
binding proteins in eukaryotes. The C2H2-type zinc finger motif,
conferring both specific RNA and DNA binding activities, was first
detected within the amino acid sequence of the Xenopus transcription
factor IIIA (Miller et al., 1985). Thereafter, vertebrate genomes were
shown to encode hundreds of so-called zinc finger proteins (ZFPs).
Subfamilies were defined on the basis of conserved sequence elements
outside the finger repeat, such as the KRAB domain. Several members of
these subfamilies were found to have a clustered genomic organization.

614855	TITLE *614855 TBC1 DOMAIN FAMILY, MEMBER 14; TBC1D14
;;KIAA1322
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Autophagy is a bulk degradation process induced in cells by a range of
pathologic conditions, including starvation. In autophagy, portions of
cytoplasm are enclosed in a double-membrane autophagosome and targeted
for degradation by fusion with endosomes and lysosomes. TBC1D14 is a
negative regulator of autophagosome formation (Longatti et al., 2012).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned TBC1D14, which they designated
KIAA1322. The deduced protein contains 702 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected variable TBC1D14 expression in all adult and fetal tissues
examined, with highest expression in adult brain, lung, and ovary and in
most specific adult brain regions examined. Expression in fetal brain
was lower than that in adult brain.

Longatti et al. (2012) reported that full-length TBC1D14 contains 693
amino acids and has a C-terminal TRE2 (USP6; 604334)-yeast Bub2-CDC16
(603461) (TBC) domain. Fluorescence-tagged TBC1D14 colocalized with
Golgi and endosome markers in transfected HEK293A cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Longatti et al. (2012) identified TBC1D14 as a negative regulator of
starvation-induced autophagosome formation in HEK293A cells. In
serum-starved HEK293A cells, TBC1D14 directly bound the
autophagy-related kinase ULK1 (603168) and the recycling
endosome-related small GTPases RAB11A (605570) and RAB11B (604198), but
it did not appear to function as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for
RAB11. Overexpression of TBC1D14 caused tubulation of recycling
endosomes, inhibited autophagosome formation, and delayed recycling of
transferrin receptor (TFRC; 190010)-associated endosomes back to the
plasma membrane. In contrast, knockdown of TBC1D14 via small interfering
RNA increased starvation-induced autophagy. Like TBC1D14 overexpression,
a dominant-negative RAB11A mutant defective for GTP binding also
inhibited starvation-induced autophagy. Longatti et al. (2012)
hypothesized that TBC1D14 inhibits autophagosome formation by
functioning as a non-GAP activator of RAB11.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the TBC1D14
gene to chromosome 4. Hartz (2012) mapped the TBC1D14 gene to chromosome
4p16.1 based on an alignment of the TBC1D14 sequence (GenBank GENBANK
AB037743) with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

605475	TITLE *605475 BAI1-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 2; BAIAP2
;;INSULIN RECEPTOR SUBSTRATE p53; IRSP53
DESCRIPTION Brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor-1 (BAI1; 602682) is a secretin
receptor family member whose expression is induced by p53 (191170). Yeh
et al. (1996) cloned a hamster cDNA encoding a 53-kD BAI-associated
protein which, when expressed in mammalian cells, is tyrosine
phosphorylated by the insulin receptor. They termed the protein IRSp53
for insulin receptor substrate p53. The protein contains 521 amino acids
with a calculated molecular mass of 57 kD and is highly expressed in the
brain. The protein appears to be localized primarily in the particulate
fraction of cell lysates. The IRSp53 cDNA was found to encode an
additional protein product of 58 kD (p58) in vivo.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen with cytoplasmic BAI1 as bait, followed by
screening of a human fetal brain cDNA library, Oda et al. (1999)
isolated a cDNA encoding BAIAP2 and a splice variant. Sequence analysis
predicted that the 520- and 521-amino acid proteins are homologous to
hamster IRSp53 with identity conserved in the C-terminal SH3 domain.
Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a 3.2-kb transcript
primarily in brain with very low levels in placenta, prostate, and
testis as well as ubiquitous expression of a 2.2-kb transcript that is
relatively abundant in liver, prostate, testis, and placenta. The
expression of the 3.2-kb transcript overlaps that of BAI1 in brain
subregions, is similar to that of neuron- and neuroendocrine-restricted
NSE (ENO2; 131360), but different from that of astrocyte-specific GFAP
(137780). Yeast 2-hybrid and GST pull-down analyses with mutated
proteins confirmed that the SH3 domain of BAIAP2 interacts with the
proline-rich cytoplasmic portion of BAI1. Double immunofluorescence
microscopy demonstrated colocalization of BAI1 and BAIAP2 in the
cytoplasmic membrane, whereas cells expressing BAIAP2 alone showed
diffuse staining of the cytosol and nucleus.

Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA; 125370) is an autosomal
dominant, progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by
selective neuron death in the dentatorubral and pallidoluysian pathways
and is associated with CAG repeats in the DRPLA gene (607462). Using a
yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human fetal brain cDNA library with
N-terminus-deleted DRPLA as bait, Okamura-Oho et al. (1999) identified
cDNAs encoding human IRSP53. Sequence analysis identified deduced
proteins of 552 and 521 amino acids. The latter sequence is 94%
identical to hamster IRSp53. Northern blot analysis revealed expression
of a 3.0-kb transcript in most tissues examined and a 3.8-kb transcript
mainly in brain, suggesting alternative splicing. After stimulation of
cells with insulin, immunoblot analysis detected a phosphorylated 58-kD
IRSP53 protein which did not enhance binding to DRPLA.
Coimmunoprecipitation analysis and reporter gene assays indicated that
DRPLA and IRSP53 do interact. Confocal microscopy demonstrated
colocalization in perinuclear dots. GST pull-down analysis determined
that the SH3 domain in the C terminus of IRSP53 binds to a proline-rich
region of DRPLA, which may be interfered with by extended polyglutamine
tracts in the form of CAG repeats.

Miki et al. (2000) demonstrated that IRSP53 is the critical linker
between RAC (see 602048) and WAVE2 (605875). Activated RAC binds to the
N terminus of IRSP53, and the C-terminal SH3 domain of IRSP53 binds to
WAVE2 to form a trimolecular complex. From studies of ectopic
expression, Miki et al. (2000) found that IRSP53 is essential for RAC to
induce membrane ruffling, probably because it recruits WAVE2, which
stimulates actin polymerization mediated by the ARP2/3 complex.

By FISH, Oda et al. (1999) mapped the BAIAP2 gene to chromosome 17q25.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The PCTAIRE protein kinases comprise a distinct subfamily of the CDC2
(116940)-related serine/threonine-specific protein kinases. See PCTK1
(311550). Meyerson et al. (1992) isolated a partial cDNA encoding
PCTAIRE3. Like other members of the PCTAIRE subfamily, the predicted
PCTAIRE3 protein contains an N-terminal extension relative to CDC2. The
CDC2-related region of PCTAIRE3, excluding the N-terminal extension,
shares 51%, 79%, and 80% protein sequence identity with CDC2, PCTK1, and
PCTK2 (603440), respectively. Northern blot analysis revealed that
PCTAIRE3 is expressed in a variety of human cell lines and tissues.
Okuda et al. (1992) identified the mouse homolog of PCTK3.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Okuda et al. (1994) mapped the
CDK18 gene to 1q31-q32.

;;WASP FAMILY, MEMBER 2;;
WASP FAMILY, VERPROLIN HOMOLOGY DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; WAVE2;;
SCAR, DICTYOSTELIUM, HOMOLOG OF, 2; SCAR2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The actin cytoskeleton plays critical roles in cell morphologic changes
and motility. Rho family small GTPases, such as Rho (see 165370), RAC
(see 602048), and CDC42 (116952), organize the actin cytoskeleton. Other
major players in actin-based motility are the 7 members of the ARP2/3
complex (see 604221). The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP;
301000), WASP-like (WASL; 605056), and WASF2 are among the downstream
effector molecules involved in the transmission of signals from tyrosine
kinase receptors and small GTPases to the actin cytoskeleton. WASF1
(605035) is also involved in actin reorganization, but its expression is
restricted to brain.

CLONING

By searching an EST database for homologs of WASF1 and by screening cDNA
libraries, Suetsugu et al. (1999) identified WASF2 and WASF3 (605068),
which they termed WAVE2 and WAVE3, respectively. The predicted 498-amino
acid WASF2 protein shares 48% amino acid identity with WASF1. Northern
blot analysis detected WASF2 expression in all tissues tested except
skeletal muscle, with strongest expression in placenta, lung, and
peripheral blood leukocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

Using SDS-PAGE analysis, Suetsugu et al. (1999) showed that, like other
WASP family members, WASF2 binds actin through its C-terminal verprolin
homology (VPH) domain. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that
ectopically expressed WASF2 induces abnormal actin clusters. These actin
cluster formations were suppressed by deletion of the VPH domain of
WASF2.

Neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP, or WASL) functions in
several intracellular events including filopodium formation, vesicle
transport, and movement of viruses, by stimulating rapid actin
polymerization through the ARP2/3 complex. N-WASP is regulated by the
direct binding of CDC42, which exposes the domain in N-WASP that
activates the ARP2/3 complex. The WASP-related protein WAVE functions in
RAC-induced membrane ruffling; however, RAC does not bind directly to
WAVE, raising the question of how WAVE is regulated by RAC. Miki et al.
(2000) demonstrated that IRSP53 (605475), a substrate for insulin
receptor with unknown function, is the 'missing link' between RAC and
WAVE2. Activated RAC binds to the N terminus of IRSP53, and the
C-terminal SH3 domain of IRSP53 binds to WAVE2 to form a trimolecular
complex. From studies of ectopic expression, Miki et al. (2000) found
that IRSP53 is essential for RAC to induce membrane ruffling, probably
because it recruits WAVE2, which stimulates actin polymerization
mediated by the ARP2/3 complex.

Suetsugu et al. (2003) observed that, following PDGF (see 190040)
stimulation, Wave2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts displayed
impaired peripheral ruffle formation, and Wave1-deficient fibroblasts
displayed impaired dorsal ruffle formation. Wave2, but not Wave1, was
essential for directed cell migration in the absence of extracellular
matrix (ECM), when cells migrated with peripheral ruffles at the leading
edge. In contrast, both Wave1 and Wave2 were essential for invading
migration into ECM, suggesting that the leading edge in ECM has
characteristics of both ruffles. In dorsal ruffles, Wave1 colocalized
with ECM-degrading enzyme Mmp2 (120360), which was required for
Wave1-dependent migration, but not Wave2-dependent migration.

Oikawa et al. (2004) determined that mouse Wave2 contains an N-terminal
inositol phosphate-binding domain. Expression of a full-length Wave2
mutant lacking lipid-binding activity inhibited proper formation of
lamellipodia in mouse fibroblasts.

MAPPING

Suetsugu et al. (1999) stated that the WASF2 gene maps to Xp11.21, near
the WASP gene at Xp11.22. Scott (2001) mapped the WASF2 gene to
chromosome 1p36.11-p34.3 based on sequence similarity between the WASF2
sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB026542) and the chromosome 1 clone RP1-144C9
(GenBank GENBANK AL096774). The related sequence on the X chromosome may
be a pseudogene.

ANIMAL MODEL

By a targeted gene disruption, Yamazaki et al. (2003) generated mice
deficient in Wave2, which is expressed predominantly in vascular
endothelial cells during embryogenesis. Wave2 null embryos showed
hemorrhages and died at approximately embryonic day 10. Deficiency in
Wave2 had no significant effect on vasculogenesis, but it decreased
sprouting and branching of endothelial cells from existing vessels
during angiogenesis. In Wave2 null endothelial cells, cell polarity
formed in response to vascular endothelial growth factor (192240), but
the formation of lamellipodia at leading edges and capillaries was
severely impaired. Yamazaki et al. (2003) concluded that WAVE2-regulated
actin reorganization might be required for proper cell movement and that
a lack of functional WAVE2 impairs angiogenesis in vivo.

;;SET7;;
SET9;;
HISTONE H3-LYSINE 4-SPECIFIC METHYLTRANSFERASE;;
H3-K4-HMTase;;
KIAA1717
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Methylation of histone H3 (see 602810) at lysine-9 (K9) by SUV39H1
(300254) and the subsequent recruitment of heterochromatin protein-1
(HP1; see 604478) is linked to gene silencing. In addition to K9, H3
methylation also occurs at K4, K27, and K36. Wang et al. (2001) reported
the purification, molecular identification, and functional
characterization of an H3-K4-specific methyltransferase (H3-K4-HMTase)
that they named SET7 due to the presence of a SET domain in its C
terminus. The authors determined that the SET7 cDNA, which is identical
to the KIAA1717 cDNA reported by Nagase et al. (2000), encodes a
366-amino acid protein that is 96% identical to its mouse homolog.

Nishioka et al. (2002) isolated SET7, which they termed SET9, from HeLa
cells. The predicted protein contains a SET domain, but it lacks the
pre- and post-SET domains.

GENE FUNCTION

Wang et al. (2001) showed that SET7 methylates H3-K4 in vitro and in
vivo and that methylation of H3-K4 and methylation of H3-K9 inhibit each
other. Furthermore, H3-K4 methylation and H3-K9 methylation by SET7 and
SUV39H1, respectively, were found to have differential effects on
subsequent histone acetylation by p300 (602700). This study provided a
molecular explanation to the differential effects of H3-K4 and H3-K9
methylation on transcription.

Chuikov et al. (2004) reported a novel mechanism of p53 (191170)
regulation through lysine methylation by Set9 methyltransferase. Set9
specifically methylates p53 at lys372 within the C-terminal regulatory
region. Methylated p53 is restricted to the nucleus and the modification
positively affects its stability. Set9 regulates the expression of p53
target genes in a manner dependent on the p53 methylation site. The
crystal structure of a ternary complex of Set9 with a p53 peptide and
the cofactor product S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine provided the molecular
basis for recognition of p53 by this lysine methyltransferase.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

The evolutionarily conserved SET domain occurs in most proteins known to
possess histone lysine methyltransferase activity. Wilson et al. (2002)
described the crystal structure of a large fragment of human SET7 that
contains an N-terminal beta-sheet domain as well as the conserved SET
domain. Mutagenesis identified 2 residues in the C terminus of the
protein that appeared essential for catalytic activity toward lys4 of
histone H3. Furthermore, the cofactor S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet)
bound to this domain. Wilson et al. (2002) presented biochemical data
supporting the role of invariant residues in catalysis, binding of
AdoMet, and interactions with the peptide substrate.

Xiao et al. (2003) identified the high-resolution crystal structure of a
ternary complex of human SET7/9 with a histone peptide and cofactor,
which revealed that the peptide substrate and cofactor bind on opposite
surfaces of the enzyme. The target lysine accesses the active site of
the enzyme and the S-adenosyl-L-methionine cofactor by inserting its
side chain into a narrow channel that runs through the enzyme,
connecting the 2 surfaces. Xiao et al. (2003) showed from the structure
and from solution studies that SET7/9, unlike most other SET proteins,
is exclusively a mono-methylase. The structure indicates the molecular
basis of the specificity of the enzyme for the histone target, and Xiao
et al. (2003) proposed a model for the methylation reaction that
accounts for the role of many of the residues that are invariant across
the SET family.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SETD7
gene to chromosome 4 (TMAP D4S3221).

607292	TITLE *607292 SEMAPHORIN 4A; SEMA4A
;;SEMAPHORIN B; SEMAB; SEMB
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SEMA4A is a member of the semaphorin family of soluble and transmembrane
proteins. Semaphorins are involved in guidance of axonal migration
during neuronal development and in immune responses.

CLONING

Using degenerate PCR primers based on motifs conserved in members of the
semaphorin family, Kumanogoh et al. (2002) identified mouse Sema4a,
which was originally identified as SemB (Puschel et al., 1995). RT-PCR
analysis detected prominent expression in adult mouse brain, spleen,
lung, kidney, and testis. Flow cytometric analysis showed expression in
B cells and dendritic cells (DCs) but not in resting T cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Kumanogoh et al. (2002) showed that activation upregulated expression of
mouse Sema4a in both B and T cells, and proliferation and interleukin-2
(IL2; 147680) production by T cells were enhanced in the presence of
Sema4a. However, Sema4a, unlike CD100 (SEMA4D; 601866), did not enhance
the activation of B cells or DCs. Mice treated with Sema4a had enhanced
priming of antigen-specific T cells secreting both IL4 (147780) and
gamma-interferon (IFNG; 147570). Treatment of mice with anti-Sema4a
early after immunization with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein
suppressed the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.
In these mice, infiltration of mononuclear inflammatory cells was
ablated by inhibition of the generation of antigen-specific T cells by
anti-Sema4a. Expression cloning determined that the high-affinity
receptor for Sema4a is Tim2. Sema4a stimulation of cells expressing Tim2
induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Tim2 but not of Tim3 (606652).
Kumanogoh et al. (2002) concluded that Sema4a and CD100 have crucial
roles in the reciprocal stimulation between T cell and
antigen-presenting cells.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Abid et al. (2006) screened 135 Pakistani patients with retinitis
pigmentosa (RP35; 610282), 25 with cone-rod dystrophy (CORD10; 610283),
and 30 with congenital blindness for mutations in the SEMA4A gene. They
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 substitutions
(607292.0001-607292.0002) in 2 RP and 2 CORD patients and heterozygosity
for another substitution (607292.0003) in 3 patients with RP and 1
patient with congenital blindness. No mutations in SEMA4A were found in
affected members of a Pakistani family with cone-rod dystrophy (CORD8;
605549) previously mapped to chromosome 1q12-q24 (Ismail et al., 2006).

In 2 Pakistani patients with retinitis pigmentosa-35 (610282) and 2 with

heterozygosity for a G-to-C transversion in codon 345 and a T-to-G
transversion in codon 350 in exon 10 of the SEMA4A gene, resulting in an
asp345-to-his (D345H) and a phe350-to-cys (F350C; 607292.0002)
substitution in the conserved semaphorin domain, respectively. Sequence
analysis of the unaffected parents of 1 of the CORD patients revealed
that his father was heterozygous for the D345H mutation and his mother
was heterozygous for the F350C mutation. Neither mutation was found in
100 ethnically matched controls.

identified heterozygosity for a G-to-A transition in codon 713 of exon
15 of the SEMA4A gene, resulting in an arg713-to-gln (R713Q)
substitution in the cytoplasmic tail. Sequence analysis of family
members of 1 of the RP patients confirmed that the R713Q mutation
segregated with the disease phenotype in an autosomal dominant mode of
inheritance, and the mutation was not found in 100 ethnically matched
controls.

URA1, YEAST, HUMAN COMPLEMENT OF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.3.1) catalyzes the fourth enzymatic
step in de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. Minet et al. (1992) isolated a
truncated human cDNA encoding this enzyme from a HeLa cell cDNA library
by functional complementation of a corresponding deletion mutant from
the Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The gene in yeast is symbolized ura1. DHO
dehydrogenase is a monofunctional protein which, in most eukaryotic
organisms, is located on the outer surface of the inner mitochondrial
membrane. In yeast, however, it has a cytosolic location.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ng et al. (2010) determined that the DHODH gene contains 9 exons.

GENE FUNCTION

White et al. (2011) used zebrafish embryos to identify the initiating
transcriptional events that occur on activation of human BRAF(V600E)
(164757.0001) in the neural crest lineage. Zebrafish embryos that are
transgenic for mitfa:BRAF(V600E) and lack p53 (191170) have a gene
signature that is enriched for markers of multipotent neural crest
cells, and neural crest progenitors from these embryos fail to
terminally differentiate. To determine whether these early
transcriptional events are important for melanoma pathogenesis, White et
al. (2011) performed a chemical genetic screen to identify
small-molecule suppressors of the neural crest lineage, which were then
tested for their effects on melanoma. One class of compound, inhibitors
of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), e.g., leflunomide, led to an
almost complete abrogation of neural crest development in zebrafish and
to a reduction in the self-renewal of mammalian neural crest stem cells.
Leflunomide exerts these effects by inhibiting the transcriptional
elongation of genes that are required for neural crest development and
melanoma growth. When used alone or in combination with a specific
inhibitor of the BRAF(V600E) oncogene, DHODH inhibition led to a marked
decrease in melanoma growth both in vitro and in mouse xenograft
studies. White et al. (2011) concluded that their studies, taken
together, highlight developmental pathways in neural crest cells that
have a direct bearing on melanoma formation.

MAPPING

Barnes et al. (1993) mapped the DHODH gene to 16q22 by fluorescence in
situ hybridization.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Mutations in the DHODH gene cause Miller syndrome (263750), an autosomal
recessive disorder also known as postaxial acrofacial dysostosis. Ng et
al. (2010) found 10 different missense mutations and 1 frameshift
mutation in the DHODH gene underlying Miller syndrome. All patients were
found to be compound heterozygotes, and each parent a carrier. These
findings were supported by whole-genome sequencing by Roach et al.
(2010).

;;SODIUM/HYDROGEN EXCHANGER 8; NHE8;;
KIAA0939
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Sodium-hydrogen exchangers (NHEs), such as SLC9A8, are integral
transmembrane proteins that exchange extracellular Na+ for intracellular
H+. NHEs have multiple functions, including intracellular pH
homeostasis, cell volume regulation, and electroneutral NaCl absorption
in epithelia (Xu et al., 2008).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) obtained a partial SLC9A8 clone, which
they designated KIAA0939. RT-PCR ELISA detected low expression in most
adult tissues and specific brain regions examined. Little to no
expression was detected in adult lung and spleen and in fetal liver and
brain.

By searching databases using rabbit Nhe3 (SLC9A3; 182307) as query,
Goyal et al. (2003) identified human SLC9A8, which they called NHE8. The
full-length protein contains 581 amino acids and shares 96% identity
with mouse Nhe8. NHE8 has an N-terminal hydrophobic domain with 10 to 12
transmembrane segments and a short C-terminal hydrophilic tail. It also
has 4 potential N-glycosylation sites, a PKC-epsilon (PRKCE; 176975)
phosphorylation site, and putative SH2-, SH3-, ERK (see MAPK3; 601795)-,
and type III PDZ-binding domains. Northern blot analysis of mouse
tissues revealed ubiquitous expression, with highest levels in kidney,
testis, skeletal muscle, and liver. Western blot analysis detected Nhe8
in apical membranes purified from rat renal cortex. In situ
hybridization of rat kidney revealed high expression of Nhe8 in proximal
tubules in the outer stripe of the outer medulla, with lower expression
in cortical proximal tubules. No message was detected in glomeruli.

Using Northern blot analysis, Xu et al. (2008) detected 7- and 4-kb NHE8
transcripts in all sections of the human gastrointestinal tract, with
highest expression in stomach, duodenum, and ascending colon. Adult
mouse gastrointestinal tract showed a slightly different distribution of
Nhe8, and Nhe8 expression was much higher in stomach and jejunum of
young mice compared with adult mice.

By immunofluorescence analysis and immunogold electron microscopy of
HeLa cells, Lawrence et al. (2010) found that the majority of NHE8
localized to the trans-Golgi network, with a smaller proportion
localized with multivesicular bodies.

GENE FUNCTION

Xu et al. (2008) found that rat Nhe8 was a functional NHE with kinetics
and an inhibitor profile that differed from other apically expressed
NHEs.

Lawrence et al. (2010) found that knockdown of NHE8 in HeLa cells, but
not knockdown of any other NHE tested, resulted in endosomal clustering,
increased proportion of dense multivesicular bodies, and elevated EGF
(131530) degradation. Overexpression of an inactive NHE8 mutant resulted
in a similar endosomal phenotype. Depletion of NHE8 had no effect on
perinuclear localization of the trans-Golgi network, rate of protein
secretion, or endosomal pH.

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the SLC9A8 gene to chromosome 20q13.13 based on an
alignment of the SLC9A8 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB023156) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

610735	TITLE *610735 MYOZENIN 3; MYOZ3
;;CALSARCIN 3;;
FATZ-RELATED PROTEIN 3; FRP3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database analysis, followed by PCR of a human skeletal muscle cDNA
library, Frey and Olson (2002) cloned MYOZ3, which they called
calsarcin-3. The predicted 251-amino acid protein exhibits highest
homology to MYOZ1 (605603) and MYOZ2 (605602) at its N and C termini and
shares 75% identity with mouse Myoz3. Northern blot analysis of adult
human tissues revealed expression of a major 3.4-kb transcript, as well
as 2 other transcripts, in skeletal muscle only,

GENE FUNCTION

Frey and Olson (2002) showed that calsarcin-3 coimmunoprecipitated with
calcineurin (see 114105) and the Z disc proteins telethonin (TCAP;
604488), alpha-actinin-2 (ACTN2; 102573), and gamma-filamin (FLNC;
102565). Analysis of deletion mutants revealed 2 independent domains
that are sufficient to bind ACTN2, an N-terminal and a C-terminal
domain, with the former domain also required for calcineurin and
telethonin binding. A second N-terminal domain mediated binding to
gamma-filamin. By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, they showed that ZASP (LDB3;
605906) interacted strongly with all 3 calsarcins. Immunolocalization
experiments revealed a strong Z disc staining pattern in cryosections of
mouse hindlimb skeletal muscle, as indicated by colocalization with
alpha-actinin. Preferential expression of calsarcin-3 in fast-twitch
myofibers was observed using immunofluorescence. Frey and Olson (2002)
proposed that calsarcins may serve to crosslink Z disc proteins,
contributing to the formation and maintenance of the Z disc.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Frey and Olson (2002) mapped the MYOZ3
gene to chromosome 5q31.

GENE STRUCTURE

Frey and Olson (2002) determined that the MYOZ3 gene contains 7 exons
and spans approximately 19 kb.

180390	TITLE *180390 RIBONUCLEOTIDE REDUCTASE, M2 SUBUNIT; RRM2
;;RIBONUCLEOTIDE REDUCTASE, SMALL SUBUNIT;;
RIBONUCLEOTIDE REDUCTASE, R2 SUBUNIT; R2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The RRM2 gene encodes the small subunit (R2) of ribonucleotide
reductase, the heterodimeric enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting
step in deoxyribonucleotide synthesis.

CLONING

Pavloff et al. (1992) cloned human RRM1 (180410) and RRM2 cDNAs from a
breast carcinoma cDNA library. The deduced 389-amino acid RRM2 protein
has a molecular mass of 45 kD and is 1 amino acid shorter than the
equivalent mouse protein. The human and mouse RRM2 proteins share 96%
homology in the C terminus, but only 69% in the first 68 residues in the
N terminus.

GENE FUNCTION

In dividing cells, ribonucleotide reductase is essential for the
production of deoxyribonucleotides before DNA synthesis in S phase.
Neither of its 2 subunits, R1 or R2, are detectable in quiescent cells.
In cycling cells, RRM2 mRNA and protein are present throughout the cell
cycle (summary by Parker et al., 1994).

Using a library of endoribonuclease-prepared short interfering RNAs
(esiRNAs), Kittler et al. (2004) identified 37 genes required for cell
division, one of which was RRM2. These 37 genes included several
splicing factors for which knockdown generates mitotic spindle defects.
In addition, a putative nuclear-export terminator was found to speed up
cell proliferation and mitotic progression after knockdown.

MAPPING

Yang-Feng et al. (1986, 1987) carried out chromosomal mapping of RRM2 by
means of a full-length mouse cDNA. By Southern blot analysis of
interspecies somatic cell hybrid lines and by in situ hybridization,
Yang-Feng et al. (1987) found that the 4 chromosomal sites carrying
M2-related sequences are 1p33-p31, 1q21-q23, 2p25-p24, and Xp21-p11. In
the mouse, M2 sequences were found on chromosomes 4, 7, 12, and 13 by
somatic cell hybrid studies. By Southern analysis of human and mouse
hydroxyurea-resistant cells that overproduce M2 due to gene
amplification, Yang-Feng et al. (1987) identified the amplified
restriction fragments as those that map to human chromosome 2 and to
mouse chromosome 12. The sites other than 2p probably represent
pseudogenes, particularly the ones on the X chromosome since active
genes on mammalian X chromosomes are conserved and no RRM2 sequence was
found on the mouse X chromosome. Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC; 165640)
is coamplified with RRM2 in human and rodent hydroxyurea-resistant cell
lines. Using cDNA clones, Yang-Feng et al. (1987) mapped ODC to the same
region of human chromosome 2. In an RRM2 overproducing mouse cell line,
they found amplification of the chromosome 12-specific restriction
fragments. Thus, the functional loci of both RRM2 and ODC are on murine
chromosome 12.

606110	TITLE *606110 LY6/NEUROTOXIN 1; LYNX1
;;SECRETED LY6/PLAUR DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; SLURP2;;
SECRETED LY6/UPAR-RELATED PROTEIN 2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The LYNX1 gene encodes a protein that shares characteristics with toxins
that bind and inhibit nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR; see,
e.g., CHRNA1, 100690) (Miwa et al., 1999). Components of snake venoms
often have structural and functional mammalian homologs. For example,
hemolytic snake venom toxins are related to cellular phospholipases
(e.g., PLA2G1B; 172410), and snake sarafotoxins may be related to
vertebrate endothelins (e.g., EDN1; 131240). The elapid venom
alpha-bungarotoxin also binds to and inhibits nAChR.

CLONING

By screening for central nervous system-specific, developmentally
regulated cDNAs in mouse, Miwa et al. (1999) identified a cDNA encoding
GC26, which was expressed in mouse cerebellum. Sequence analysis
predicted that the 116-amino acid protein contains a signal sequence at
its N terminus, a cysteine-rich consensus motif characteristic of LY6
family proteins (e.g., CD59; 107271) and snake alpha-neurotoxins, and an
asparagine/GPI anchor motif at its C terminus. The overall structure of
GC26 is similar to that of LY6 family proteins and snake
alpha-neurotoxins, and Miwa et al. (1999) redesignated the protein
'Ly6/neurotoxin-1,' or Lynx1. A partial sequence encoding a human Lynx1
homolog has been identified (GenBank GENBANK AF321824). Northern blot
analysis revealed predominant expression of Lynx1 in mouse brain. In
situ hybridization analysis showed Lynx1 expression in neurons in
multiple brain structures. Immunocytochemistry demonstrated expression
of Lynx1 in neuronal soma and proximal dendrites.

Using microarray analysis to identify ESTs expressed predominantly in
the skin of patients with psoriasis vulgaris (see 177900), followed by
PCR and RACE of cultured keratinocyte cDNA libraries, Tsuji et al.
(2003) cloned LYNX1, which they called SLURP2. The deduced 97-amino acid
protein contains a signal peptide and 10 conserved cysteine residues
with a spacing pattern characteristic of the LY6 superfamily, but it
does not have the GPI anchor or transmembrane domains found in
membrane-bound LY6 proteins. Northern blot analysis detected a 0.6-kb
transcript in esophagus and a 1.6-kb transcript in stomach and duodenum.
No expression was detected in other tissues examined, including skin.
RT-PCR detected abundant LYNX1 expression in cervix and esophagus, with
lower expression in adult and fetal skin and keratinocytes. Weak
expression was detected in brain, lung, stomach, small intestine, colon,
rectum, uterus, and thymus. No expression was detected in spleen and
bone marrow. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis detected a 3.8- to
2.8-fold increase in LYNX1 expression in lesional skin from 5 psoriasis
patients compared with nonlesional skin or normal skin.

GENE FUNCTION

Functional analysis by Miwa et al. (1999) indicated that Lynx1 is not a
ligand or neurotransmitter but has the capacity to enhance nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor function in the presence of acetylcholine.

Morishita et al. (2010) identified an increase in expression of Lynx1
protein in mice that prevented plasticity in the primary visual cortex
late in life. Removal of this molecular brake enhanced nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor signaling. Lynx1 expression thus maintains
stability of mature cortical networks in the presence of cholinergic
innervation. Morishita et al. (2010) concluded that modulating the
balance between excitatory and inhibitory circuits reactivates visual
plasticity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tsuji et al. (2003) determined that the LYNX1 gene contains 3 exons and
spans about 5.6 kb. The promoter region contains 3 Sp1 (189906)- and 2
AP1 (165160)-binding sites, as well as single sites for E2F (189971) and
GATA3 (131320). It lacks TATA and CAAT consensus sequences. There are 2
major transcriptional initiation sites.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Tsuji et al. (2003) mapped the LYNX1 gene
to chromosome 8q24.3. Southern blot analysis indicated that LYNX1 is a
single-copy gene.

EVOLUTION

Human evolution is characterized by a dramatic increase in brain size
and complexity. To probe its genetic basis, Dorus et al. (2004) examined
the evolution of genes involved in diverse aspects of nervous system
biology. These genes, including LYNX1, displayed significantly higher
rates of protein evolution in primates than in rodents. This trend was
most pronounced for the subset of genes implicated in nervous system
development. Moreover, within primates, the acceleration of protein
evolution was most prominent in the lineage leading from ancestral
primates to humans. Dorus et al. (2004) concluded that the phenotypic
evolution of the human nervous system has a salient molecular correlate,
i.e., accelerated evolution of the underlying genes, particularly those
linked to nervous system development.

ANIMAL MODEL

Miwa et al. (2006) found that Lynx1 -/- mice showed no gross
abnormalities in size, viability, CNS morphology, or longevity compared
to wildtype mice. However, Lynx1-null mice showed increased learning and
memory in a fear-conditioned paradigm and displayed increased
sensitivity to nicotine in motor tasks compared to wildtype. Neurons
from Lynx1-null mice showed heightened sensitivity and increased
intracellular calcium levels in response to nicotine. Loss of Lynx1
decreased receptor desensitization and enhanced synaptic efficacy.
Mutant neurons were also more sensitive to excitotoxic insult, and Lynx1
mutant mice exhibited age-dependent degeneration that was exacerbated by
nicotine and rescued by null mutations in nAChR subunits. These data
supported the hypotheses that Lynx1 normally decreases activity of
nAChRs and that deletion of Lynx1 shifts the balance in favor of
increased neuronal activity and synaptic plasticity. But the short-term
benefits of the loss of Lynx1 were counterbalanced by an increased
vulnerability of Lynx1 mutant neurons to glutamate toxicity and by loss
of nicotine's neuroprotective effect on these cells. Miwa et al. (2006)
concluded that Lynx1 modulates nAChR function to maintain low
sensitivity and plays a critical role in maintaining a balance between
the beneficial effects of short-term nAChR activation and the
degenerative effects of chronic receptor activation.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Experimental evidence indicates that specific protein-tyrosine
phosphatases (PTPases) interact with members of cascades to modulate
biologic function differentiation and development. Experiments suggested
that the PTPases PTP-beta (176882) and PTP-epsilon (600926) are involved
in the early molecular events for in vitro differentiation of mouse
erythroleukemia (MEL) as well as embryonic carcinoma (F9) cells
(Watanabe et al., 1995).

CLONING

A human homolog of mouse Ptprj, encoding PTP-beta-2, was identified by
Ostman et al. (1994).

Honda et al. (1994) cloned and characterized the PTPRJ gene, which they
designated HPTP-eta. The predicted protein has a molecular mass of
approximately 220 to 250 kD and contains an extracellular region
homologous to fibronectin type III repeats, a transmembrane region, and
a cytoplasmic region containing a single PTPase-like domain.

MAPPING

Honda et al. (1994) mapped the PTPRJ gene to chromosome 11p11.2 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

Using mouse cDNA for PTP-beta-2 and PTP-epsilon, Watanabe et al. (1995)
assigned the genes, Ptprj and Ptpre, to chromosome 2 and chromosome 7,
respectively.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Nonfamilial, 'sporadic' cancers, which represent most cancer cases, have
a significant hereditary component, but the genes involved have low
penetrance and are extremely difficult to detect. Therefore, mapping and
cloning of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for cancer susceptibility in
animals may help identify homologous genes in humans. For example,
several cancer susceptibility QTLs were mapped in mouse and rat. One of
these, the mouse gene Scc1 (susceptibility to colon cancer-1), was
positionally cloned by Ruivenkamp et al. (2002) and identified as Ptprj,
which encodes a receptor-type protein-tyrosine phosphatase. Furthermore,
in human cancers of colon, lung, and breast, Ruivenkamp et al. (2002)
found frequent deletions, loss of heterozygosity, and missense mutations
in the PTPRJ gene (see, e.g., 600925.0001-600925.0002).

Lesueur et al. (2005) assessed common SNPs and haplotypes of the PTPRJ
gene in 4,512 breast cancer (114480) patients and 4,554 controls from
East Anglia, U.K. The authors observed a difference in the haplotype
frequency distributions between patients and controls (P = 0.0023; OR =
0.81; range 0.72-0.92). They concluded that carrying a specific PTPRJ
haplotype may confer a protective effect on the risk of breast cancer.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
COLON CANCER, SOMATIC
PTPRJ, ARG214CYS

Ruivenkamp et al. (2002) identified 5 somatic missense mutations in the
PTPRJ gene in colon cancer (see 114500). Sequence alignments, secondary
structure prediction, and homology modeling predicted with high
confidence levels that most of these in the extracellular portion of the
gene product occur in exposed regions available for interactions with
ligands or other proteins and could affect the signaling process. One of
these missense mutations was an arg214-to-cys mutation (R214C) that
resulted in loss of a positive charge.

.0002
COLON CANCER, SOMATIC
PTPRJ, GLN276PRO

In a colon cancer (see 114500), Ruivenkamp et al. (2002) found a
gln276-to-pro (Q276P) mutation in exon 5 of the PTPRJ gene. The change
was predicted to result in torsional stress.

600025	TITLE *600025 KINESIN LIGHT CHAIN 1; KLC1
;;KINESIN 2; KNS2;;
KNS2A;;
KLC
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Kinesins are tubulin (see 191130) molecular motors that transport
organelles within cells and move chromosomes along microtubules during
cell division. In sea urchin and mammalian cells, kinesins have been
characterized as tetrameric proteins containing 2 heavy (alpha) chains
of approximately 120 kD and 2 light (beta) chains of approximately 70
kD. The alpha chains provide the tubulin binding site and the ATPase
domains, whereas the beta chains are responsible for the specific
attachment of the organelle to be moved by the kinesin tetramer.
Kinesins transport their bound organelle to the plus end of the
microtubule (summary by Chernajovsky et al., 1996).

CLONING

Chernajovsky et al. (1996) noted that differential splicing occurs for
the kinesin beta (light chain) cDNA sequences at the 3-prime end of the
rat kinesin mRNA, producing kinesins having different C-terminal ends
that seem to confer the kinesin specificity for organelle binding.
Cabeza-Arvelaiz et al. (1993) isolated and sequenced a cDNA encoding the
human kinesin light chain protein (KLC). The cDNA encodes a deduced
polypeptide of 569 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 64,789
Da. The predicted secondary internal structure of the KLC molecule
consists of about 27 contiguous repeats, each of approximately 21 amino
acids, and could be divided into 3 domains.

Rahman et al. (1998) cloned mouse Klc1. The deduced 581-amino acid
protein has an N-terminal coiled-coil region of about 100 amino acids
and 6 imperfect tetratricopeptide repeats of about 34 amino acids each.
Northern and Western blot analyses detected Klc1 predominantly in mouse
central and peripheral neuronal tissues. Immunofluorescence analysis of
cultured rat hippocampal precursor cells showed that Klc1 levels
increased with differentiation. In situ hybridization of mouse brain
showed that both Klc1 and Klc2 (611729) were enriched in olfactory bulb,
hippocampus, dentate gyrus, and the granular layer of cerebellum. Klc1
was expressed in a subset of cells in the sciatic nerve and showed
diffuse axonal staining. Fractionation of whole mouse brain extracts
revealed Klc1 and Klc2 in the cytosolic fraction and Klc2 in the
microsomal fraction.

GENE FUNCTION

Chernajovsky et al. (1996) characterized the human KNS2 gene product of
a differentially spliced, T-cell-derived mRNA and cloned its promoter
region. The promoter region transcribes constitutively. In permanently
transfected human HeLa and NB100 neuroblastoma cells, a reporter gene
containing the promoter and part of the first exon of beta kinesin was
75-fold more active than the HSV-tk promoter. The first exon contains a
5-prime untranslated sequence capable of forming a stable double-hairpin
loop, which functions as a translational enhancer. Its deletion
decreases the efficiency of in vitro translation of beta kinesin mRNA.

Kamal et al. (2000) demonstrated that the axonal transport of APP
(104760) in neurons is mediated by the direct binding of APP to the
light chain subunit of kinesin-1.

Using anti-mouse Klc1 antibodies to immunoprecipitate proteins from
mouse brain lysates, Rahman et al. (1998) showed that Klc1 associated
with Nkhc (KIF5A; 602821) and Ukhc (KIF5B; 602809), but not with Klc2.
In the presence of a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, both Klc1 and Klc2
cosedimented with taxol-stabilized mouse brain microtubules.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chernajovsky et al. (1996) determined that the entire KNS2 gene spans 90
kb and encodes a 70-kD protein.

MAPPING

Cabeza-Arvelaiz et al. (1993) assigned the KLC gene to chromosome 14 by
screening of a human/hamster somatic cell hybrid panel. Goedert et al.
(1996) mapped the KNS2 gene to 14q32.3 by fluorescence in situ
hybridization.
