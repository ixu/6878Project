MULTIPLE EPIDERMAL GROWTH FACTOR-LIKE DOMAINS 4; MEGF4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the SLIT family, such as SLIT1, are secreted glycoproteins
that bind and activate ROBO receptors (see ROBO1; 602430) and function
in axon guidance during development (Xiao et al., 2011).

CLONING

In Drosophila embryogenesis, the 'slit' gene has been shown to play a
critical role in central nervous system midline formation. Itoh et al.
(1998) cloned SLIT1, a human homolog of the Drosophila 'slit' gene. They
also cloned 2 additional human 'slit' homologs, which they termed SLIT2
(603746) and SLIT3 (603745), as well as the rat homolog, Slit1. Each
SLIT gene encodes a putative secreted protein that contains conserved
protein-protein interaction domains, including leucine-rich repeats and
epidermal growth factor-like (see 131530) motifs, similar to those of
the Drosophila protein. The SLIT1 cDNA encodes a 1,534-amino acid
polypeptide with 43.5% similarity to the Drosophila 'slit' protein.
Northern blot analysis revealed that the human SLIT1 gene was expressed
as a major 8.4- and a minor 5.9-kb transcript primarily in the brain.
SLIT2 and SLIT3 mRNAs were primarily expressed in the spinal cord and
thyroid, respectively. In situ hybridization studies indicated that the
rat Slit1 mRNA was specifically expressed in the neurons of fetal and
adult forebrains. These data suggested that the SLIT genes form an
evolutionarily conserved group in vertebrates and invertebrates, and
that the mammalian SLIT proteins may participate in the formation and
maintenance of the nervous and endocrine systems by protein-protein
interactions.

GENE FUNCTION

Wu et al. (1999) reported that the secreted protein Slit repels neuronal
precursors migrating from the anterior subventricular zone in the
telencephalon to the olfactory bulb. They provided direct demonstration
of a molecular cue whose concentration gradient guides the direction of
migrating neurons. Both the Slit1 and Slit2 genes are expressed in the
murine postnatal septum and the neocortex. Wu et al. (1999) concluded
that their data support a common guidance mechanism for axon projection
and neuronal migration, and suggested that Slit may provide a molecular
tool with potential therapeutic applications in controlling and
directing cell migration.

Using cocultured explants of mouse embryonic retina, Plump et al. (2002)
found that Slit1, like Slit2, is a potent inhibitor of retinal axon
growth, inducing a similar decrease in the extent of outgrowth to that
seen in the presence of Slit2.

MAPPING

By PCR analysis of radiation hybrid panels, Nakayama et al. (1998)
mapped the SLIT1 gene, which they referred to as the MEGF4 gene, to
chromosome 10q23.3-q24.

ANIMAL MODEL

To investigate the role of Slit proteins in retinal ganglion cell axon
guidance, Plump et al. (2002) used gene targeting to generate mice
deficient in either Slit1 or Slit2. The knockout mice exhibited few
retinal ganglion cell axon guidance defects and the authors concluded
that Slit1 and Slit2 deficiency alone does not cause significant defects
in axon guidance within the developing visual system. In contrast, they
demonstrated that Slit1/2 double mutants develop severe and persistent
axon guidance defects in the visual system. Using lipophilic dye tracing
and immunohistochemistry, they detected defects in the double knockout
mice including the formation of a second, ectopic optic chiasm; aberrant
growth of retinal axons into the contralateral optic nerve; and axon
wandering defects in the ventral diencephalon. Plump et al. (2002)
concluded that Slit1 and Slit2 play a critical role in channeling
retinal axons toward their appropriate midline crossing point, serving
as inhibitors for growth into inappropriate regions of the brain. The
authors hypothesized that the complementary domains of Slit1 and Slit2
expression surrounding the path of the ingrowing retinal axons establish
a corridor through which retinal axons can travel, resulting in the
correct positioning of the optic chiasm within the brain.

Using immunohistochemistry and axon tracing experiments, Bagri et al.
(2002) presented a detailed characterization of abnormal axonal
projections within the forebrain of Slit2 knockout and Slit1/2 double
knockout mice (Plump et al. (2002)). They provided in vivo evidence that
Slit proteins are regulators of guidance of corticofugal, callosal,
thalamocortical, serotonergic, and dopaminergic projections in the
embryonic forebrain. The authors concluded that Slit proteins in the
brain appear to contribute to the maintenance of dorsal position by
prevention of axonal growth into ventral regions, the prevention of
axonal extension toward and across the midline, and the channeling of
axons toward particular regions.

In the mouse ventral spinal cord, Hochstim et al. (2008) identified 3
subtypes of white matter astrocytes with differential gene expression
corresponding to position. Astrocytes expressing both Reln (600514) and
Slit1 were in the ventrolateral domain, those expressing Reln only were
at the dorsolateral domain, and those expressing Slit1 only were at the
ventromedial domain. The distinct positions of these astrocytes were
specified by varying expression of the homeodomain transcription factors
Pax6 (607108) and Nkx6.1 (602563). The findings indicated that
positional identity is an organizing principle underlying phenotypic
diversity among white matter astrocytes, as well as among neurons, and
that this diversity is prespecified within precursor cells in the
germinal zone of the CNS.

Using a zebrafish model, Xiao et al. (2011) showed that the type IV
collagen Col4a5 (303630) on the surface of the tectum basement membrane
bound Slit1 and guided retinal ganglion cell axons expressing Robo2.

612681	TITLE *612681 CUGBP- AND ELAV-LIKE FAMILY, MEMBER 6; CELF6
;;BRUNO-LIKE 6; BRUNOL6;;
CUGBP- AND ETR3-LIKE FACTOR 6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the CELF family, such as CELF6, play various roles in
cotranscriptional and posttranscriptional RNA processing. All CELF
proteins appear to affect pre-mRNA splicing, but individual CELFs have
divergent roles in regulating mRNA stability and translation (summary by
Wagnon et al., 2012).

CLONING

By searching databases for human sequences similar to Xenopus Brunol1
(TNRC4; 612678), Good et al. (2000) identified BRUNOL6. The deduced
protein contains 2 N-terminal domain RNA-recognition motifs (RRMs), a
long linker region, and a C-terminal RRM.

By searching genomic sequences from CELF-like proteins, followed by PCR
of a human brain cDNA library, Ladd et al. (2004) cloned full-length
BRUNOL6, which they called CELF6. The deduced 481-amino acid protein has
a calculated molecular mass of 50.4 kD. CELF6 has 3 RRMs, with a
268-amino acid divergent domain separating RRM2 and RRM3. It also has
numerous potential phosphorylation sites, a potential nuclear
localization signal at the C terminus, and an alanine-rich region within
the divergent domain. Ladd et al. (2004) also identified 3 splice
variants of CELF6 that encode proteins with C-terminal truncations
compared with full-length CELF6 (isoform-1). Isoform-2 contains RRM1 and
part of RRM2, isoform-3, the shortest isoform, contains only RRM1, and
isoform-4 contains RRM1, RRM2, and part of the divergent domain.
Northern blot analysis detected 7.5- and 4.0-kb transcripts that were
abundantly expressed in kidney and brain, respectively. Both variants
were detected at low levels in several other tissues. RNA dot blot
analysis revealed highest CELF6 expression in adult kidney, brain, and
testis, with low expression in most other tissues. CELF6 was detected in
fetal brain, but only low expression was detected in fetal kidney.
Western blot analysis showed that full-length CELF6, isoform-2, and
isoform-4 were expressed in transfected quail fibroblasts, but isoform-3
was not detected, apparently due to protein instability.

GENE FUNCTION

CELF proteins (e.g., TNRC4; 612678) promote active exon inclusion of
cardiac troponin T (TNNT2; 191045) minigenes in vivo via muscle-specific
splicing enhancer (MSE) sequences. Ladd et al. (2004) showed that
full-length CELF6, isoform-2, and isoform-4 promoted exon inclusion from
these minigenes in a dose- and isoform-dependent manner. Full-length
CELF6 also promoted insulin receptor (INSR; 147670) exon 11 skipping in
a dose-dependent manner, similar to CUGBP (601074), whereas CELF6
isoform-4 showed weaker exon skipping potential, and isoform-2 had no
effect.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Good et al. (2000) mapped the BRUNOL6 gene
to chromosome 15q24.
