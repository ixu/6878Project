;;KCHIP2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In the brain and heart, rapidly inactivating (A-type) voltage-gated
potassium (Kv) currents operate at subthreshold membrane potentials to
control the excitability of neurons and cardiac myocytes. An et al.
(2000) described 3 Kv channel-interacting proteins called KCHIPs that
bind to the cytoplasmic amino termini of Kv4-alpha subunits. See KCHIP1
(604660). The KCHIP2 cDNA encodes a 252-amino acid protein that has a
distinct amino terminus but shares approximately 70% amino acid identity
with KCHIP1 and KCHIP3 throughout a carboxy-terminal 185-amino acid core
domain containing 4 EF-hand-like motifs. Expression of KCHIP2 and Kv4
together reconstituted several features of native A-type currents by
modulating the density, inactivation kinetics, and rate of recovery from
inactivation of Kv4 channels in heterologous cells. The KCHIPs
colocalized and coimmunoprecipitated with brain Kv4-alpha subunits and
are thus integral components of native Kv4 channel complexes.

GENE FUNCTION

Jeyaraj et al. (2012) provided molecular evidence that links circadian
rhythms to vulnerability in ventricular arrhythmias in mice.
Specifically, they showed that cardiac ion channel expression and QT
interval duration (an index of myocardial repolarization) exhibit
endogenous circadian rhythmicity under the control of a clock-dependent
oscillator, Kruppel-like factor-15 (KLF15; 606465). Klf15
transcriptionally controls rhythmic expression of KChIP2, a critical
subunit required for generating the transient outward potassium current.
Deficiency or excess of Klf15 causes loss of rhythmic QT variation,
abnormal repolarization, and enhanced susceptibility to ventricular
arrhythmias. Jeyaraj et al. (2012) concluded that their findings
identified circadian transcription of ion channels as a mechanism for
cardiac arrhythmogenesis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Kuo et al. (2001) found that knockout mice deficient for Kchip2
exhibited normal cardiac structure and function but displayed a
prolonged elevation in the ST segment on the electrocardiogram. The
Kchip2 -/- mice were highly susceptible to the induction of cardiac
arrhythmias. Single-cell analysis revealed a substrate for
arrhythmogenesis, including a complete absence of transient outward
potassium current (I-to) and a marked increase in action potential
duration. These studies demonstrated that a defect in KCHIP2 is
sufficient to confer a marked genetic susceptibility to arrhythmias,
establishing a novel genetic pathway for ventricular tachycardia via a
loss of the transmural gradient of I-to.

610400	TITLE *610400 MACRO DOMAIN-CONTAINING 1; MACROD1
;;LRP16 PROTEIN; LRP16
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By restriction landmark genomic analysis of human lymphocytes, followed
by PCR and RACE, Han et al. (2001) cloned MACROD1, which they called
LRP16. Zhao et al. (2005) noted that LRP16 encodes a 325-amino acid
protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhao et al. (2005) reported that ectopic expression of LRP16 stimulated
proliferation of MCF7 breast cancer cells. LRP16 expression was
stimulated by 17-beta-estradiol (E2), and a 2.6-kb fragment upstream of
the translation start site of LRP16 contains ESR1 (133430)
responsiveness. Using 5-prime deletion constructs in MCF7 and HeLa
cells, Zhao et al. (2005) showed that the LRP16 proximal region of -251
to -214 bp contributed to E2-induced transactivation, via an
estrogen-responsive element half-site and an SP1 (189906) binding site.
Gel mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that
ESR1 and SP1 bound directly to DNA and were required for E2-induced
transactivation of LRP16.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the MACROD1
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP STS-RH38365).
