IL1 RECEPTOR-RELATED PROTEIN; IL1RRP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a YAC template known to contain IL1R1 (147810), Parnet et al.
(1996) cloned by PCR with degenerate primers what was thought to be a
member of the interleukin-1 receptor family, which they called IL1
receptor-related protein (IL1RRP). The gene encodes a deduced 541-amino
acid protein. Although the sequence was similar to that of IL1Rs, the
extracellular portion failed to bind IL1A (147760), IL1B (147720), or
IL1RN (147679). When the cytoplasmic domain was fused to mouse IL1
extracellular and transmembrane portions, it activated NF-kappa-B
(164011) in response to IL1. Northern blot analysis revealed that IL1RRP
is expressed in lung, leukocytes, spleen, liver, thymus, prostate, small
intestine, colon, placenta, and heart, and is absent from brain,
skeletal muscle, pancreas, and kidney.

Torigoe et al. (1997) purified human IL18R, symbolized IL18R1, by
selecting a Hodgkin disease cell line, L428, that was the best binder in
IL18 (600953) binding assays. The binding of radiolabeled IL18 was
inhibited by IL18 but not by IL1B, with which it has 15% amino acid
homology but no functional resemblance. The authors raised a monoclonal
antibody against L428 cells and used it to purify IL18R from solubilized
cells after wheat germ lectin chromatography. They found that the
internal amino acid sequence matched that of IL1RRP. When expressed in
COS-1 cells, the cDNA of IL1RRP conferred IL18 binding properties and
the ability to activate NF-kappa-B in response to IL18 but not IL1B.

MAPPING

Dale and Nicklin (1999) showed by radiation hybrid mapping that IL1R2
(147811), IL1R1, IL1RL2 (604512), IL1RL1 (601203), and IL18R1 map to
2q12 and are transcribed in the same direction, with IL1R2 being
transcribed towards the cluster.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Hunt et al. (2008) found an association between celiac disease (CELIAC8;
612006) and dbSNP rs917997, a SNP located in an extended haplotype block
that includes the IL18R1 and IL18RAP (604509) genes. Zhernakova et al.
(2008) found strong association between dbSNP rs917997 and both Crohn
disease and ulcerative colitis (see IBD1, 266600).

IL18R1 gene and susceptibility to leprosy, see 609888.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using database analysis and protein profiling to identify human
orthologs of yeast cytochrome c oxidase (COX) assembly proteins,
followed by PCR of a heart cDNA library, Szklarczyk et al. (2012) cloned
PET100. Mouse heart Pet100 localized to mitochondria.

GENE FUNCTION

Szklarczyk et al. (2012) showed that epitope-tagged PET100 copurified
with the COX assembly protein COX17 (604813) from transfected HEK293
cells.

MAPPING

;;PB1;;
BRG1-ASSOCIATED FACTOR, 180-KD; BAF180
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Multisubunit ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complexes facilitate the
opening of chromatin structures to allow transcription and other
metabolic reactions to occur on DNA. The complexes contain an ATPase
related to yeast Swi2/Snf2-like ATPases (e.g., SMARCA2; 600014) and use
the energy of ATP hydrolysis to disrupt nucleosomes. By biochemical
purification of the Polybromo- and BRG1 (603254)-associated factor
(PBAF) complex, or SWI/SNF complex B, followed by micropeptide sequence
analysis, EST database searching, and screening of a T-cell cDNA
library, Xue et al. (2000) obtained a cDNA encoding BAF180. Immunoblot
analysis showed that BAF180 was expressed as a 180-kD protein. The
deduced 1,582-amino acid BAF180 protein, which is 90% identical to the
chicken polybromo-1 protein, possesses 5 bromodomains, 2 bromo-adjacent
homology (BAH) regions, and 1 high-mobility group (HMG) motif. BAF180 is
also highly homologous to yeast Rsc1, Rsc2, and Rsc3, essential proteins
that are required for cell cycle progression through mitosis. Northern
blot analysis revealed wide expression of 9.5- and 7.5-kb BAF180
transcripts. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that BAF180 was
expressed in the nucleus during interphase but colocalized with
cytoplasmic dynein (see 600112) at some kinetochores during
prometaphase. The localization of BAF180 at kinetochores was not
observed in metaphase, anaphase, or telophase. Xue et al. (2000)
proposed that BAF180 and PBAF are more closely related to yeast Rsc than
to SWI/SNF.

GENE FUNCTION

Using an integrated chromatin-dependent reconstituted transcription
reaction, Lemon et al. (2001) identified PBAF, but not SWI/SNF or the
ISWI (see 603375)-containing chromatin remodeling complex ACF, as a
cofactor necessary for ligand-dependent transactivation by nuclear
hormone receptors. Further immunoprecipitation analysis determined that
PBAF as well as TFIID (see 313650) and ARC (see 605718) are required for
transcription from a chromatin template, but only TFIID is needed for
transcription from naked DNA. Lemon et al. (2001) suggested that
different chromatin-remodeling complexes may perform quite specific
functions that are not interchangeable in supporting transcription.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Varela et al. (2011) sequenced the protein coding exome in a series of
primary clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and reported the
identification of mutations in PBRM1 as a second (VHL, 608537 being the
first) major ccRCC cancer gene, with truncating mutations in 41%
(92/227) of cases. Varela et al. (2011) concluded that their data
further elucidated the somatic genetic architecture of ccRCC and
emphasized the marked contribution of aberrant chromatin biology.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PBRM1
gene to chromosome 3 (TMAP stSG47433).

ANIMAL MODEL

Wang et al. (2004) found that Baf180-null mouse embryos died between
embryonic day 12.5 and 15.5. Most organs were present and appeared
grossly normal, except that liver and lung were small. Mutant embryos
showed generalized edema due to reduced heart rate and blood volume.
Histologic examination revealed severe hypoplasia of the cardiac
ventricular free walls, as well as ventricular septal defect; other
heart structures appeared normal. Tunnel assays indicated a failure in
cell growth or differentiation rather than cell death caused the heart
defects. Placentas from Baf180-null fetuses were also abnormal, with
indistinct spongiotrophoblast and labyrinthine layers. Wang et al.
(2004) found that Baf180 was recruited to the promoter regions of
S100a13 (601989), Rarb2 (RARB; 180220), and Crabp2 (180231), and Baf180
deficiency affected the retinoic acid responses of Rarb2 and Crabp2.

603540	TITLE *603540 GAMMA-AMINOBUTYRIC ACID B RECEPTOR 1; GABBR1
;;GABA-B RECEPTOR, R1 SUBUNIT; GABABR1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors are a family of proteins
involved in the GABAergic neurotransmission of the mammalian central
nervous system. The metabotropic GABA-B receptors are coupled to G
proteins and modulate synaptic transmission through intracellular
effector systems. GABA-B receptors function by inhibiting presynaptic
transmitter release or by increasing the potassium conductance
responsible for long-lasting inhibitory postsynaptic potentials
(Bittiger et al., 1993; Goei et al., 1998).

CLONING

Goei et al. (1998) and Grifa et al. (1998) characterized the human
GABA-B receptor-1 (GABBR1) gene. Northern blot analysis revealed that
the GABBR1 gene was expressed as a 4.4-kb mRNA, with high levels in
human brain and lower levels in small intestine and uterus. The
predicted 961-amino acid GABBR1 protein contains an N-terminal signal
peptide, a large N-terminal extracellular domain structurally similar to
bacterial amino acid-binding proteins, and 7 closely spaced putative
transmembrane domains that are characteristic of G protein-coupled
receptors. Grifa et al. (1998) reported that human GABBR1 and the rat
GABA-B R1a receptor share 99% protein sequence identity.

Kaupmann et al. (1997) described 2 Gabbr1 transcripts in rat, Gabbr1a
and Gabbr1b, which encode proteins that differ only in their N-terminal
sequences.

Peters et al. (1998) identified 2 splice variants of human GABBR1 that
differ in their 5-prime ends and in their translational start sites. The
longer transcript, GABABR1a, contains 4 exons not found in GABABR1b, and
the first exon of GABABR1b contains intronic sequence not found in
GABABR1a.

Martin et al. (2001) reported that splice junctions present in the
GABBR1 gene sequence are consistent with the formation of a GABBR1c
alternate transcript resulting from exon skipping of 1 sushi domain
module. Using RNA analysis, Martin et al. (2001) detected GABBR1c
transcripts in fetal and adult human brain.

By PCR of adult human brain and prostate cDNA libraries, Schwarz et al.
(2000) isolated a GABBR1 clone, GABAB1e, that lacks exon 10. Due to the
introduction of a stop codon, the deduced GABAB1e protein is truncated
compared with full-length GABAB1a and contains only the ligand-binding
extracellular domain. RT-PCR analysis showed that GABAB1e was a minor
variant relative to GABAB1a in adult and fetal whole brain and in adult
cerebellum and spinal cord, but that it was the dominant transcript in
all peripheral tissues examined. A similar tissue distribution was found
in rat.

Lamp et al. (2001) cloned 2 mouse Gabbr1 variants that show nearly
identical splicing as the human GABABR1a and GABABR1b variants cloned by
Peters et al. (1998). The deduced mouse and human GABABR1a proteins
share 98.2% identity. RT-PCR of mouse tissues detected Gababr1 in
cortex, cerebellum, and spinal cord, but not in heart, liver, spleen,
kidney, and testis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Goei et al. (1998) determined that the GABBR1 gene contains 22 exons and
spans at least 18 kb. Peters et al. (1998) also reported that the GABBR1
gene contains 22 exons.

Lamp et al. (2001) noted that both the mouse and human GABBR1 genes
contain potential transcription initiation sites within 2 potential CpG
islands.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Goei et al. (1998) mapped the human GABBR1
gene to chromosome 6p21.3 and the mouse Gabbr1 gene to chromosome 17.
They identified a putative human GABBR1 pseudogene 2 Mb telomeric of the
GABBR1 gene.

Independently, Lamp et al. (2001) mapped the mouse Gabbr1 gene to a
region of chromosome 17 that shares homology of synteny with human
chromosome 6p21.3.

GENE FUNCTION

In studies in rat, Kaupmann et al. (1998) and Jones et al. (1998) found
that GABBR1a, GABBR1b and GABBR2 (GPR51; 607340) alone do not activate
Kir3-type potassium channels efficiently, but coexpression of these
receptors confers robust stimulation of channel activity. Kaupmann et
al. (1998) provided evidence for the assembly of heteromeric GABA-B
receptors in vivo and showed that GPR51 and GABBR1a/b proteins
immunoprecipitate and localize together at dendritic spines. Jones et
al. (1998) detected colocalization of Gabbr1 and Gabbr2 in the same
subpopulations of neurons and concluded that GABBR1 and GPR51 are
targeted to the plasma membrane and associate with each other in a
heteromeric complex, probably as dimers. White et al. (1998) concluded
that GPR51 and GABBR1 form heterodimers through an interaction at their
intracellular C-terminal tails.

Both Ng et al. (1999) and Kuner et al. (1999) detected colocalization of
Gabbr1 and Gpr51 transcripts in many brain regions of rat brain. Kuner
et al. (1999) concluded that the interaction of these receptors appears
to be crucial for important physiologic effects of GABA and provides a
mechanism in receptor signaling pathways that involve a heterotrimeric
GTP-binding protein.

Clark et al. (2000) compared the similar distribution of Gabbr1 and
Gpr51 expression in rat CNS. The authors concluded that native GABA-B
receptors function as heteromeric proteins, the most abundant form being
the Gabbr1/Gpr51 receptor. However, the more limited distribution of
Gpr51 receptor mRNA led Clark et al. (2000) to hypothesize that there
are brain regions where GABA-B receptors are composed of Gabbr1 and as
yet unidentified family members.

Using Northern blot analysis, Martin et al. (1999) detected a 4.4-kb
GABBR1 transcript in human brain regions including the cerebral cortex,
frontal lobe, occipital pole, temporal lobe, cerebellum, medulla,
amygdala, hippocampus, substantia nigra, and thalamus. Using in situ
hybridization with adult rat tissues, they detected overlapping, but
distinct expression patterns for Gpr51 and Gabbr1 in the nervous system.
The authors concluded that GPR51 and GABBR1 are distinct in their
structure, expression pattern, and plasma membrane localization.

By analyzing surface expression of GABBR1 deletion and point mutation
constructs, Margeta-Mitrovic et al. (2000) identified an RXR(R) motif in
the C terminus of GABBR1, which they hypothesized is responsible for
endoplasmic reticulum retention of heterologously expressed GABBR1. They
concluded that this GABBR1 retention signal is shielded by the
interaction of GABBR1 and GPR51, thereby allowing the assembled
heterodimeric complex to traffic to the cell surface. Only completely
assembled heterodimers were able to activate GIRK channels in Xenopus
oocytes, leading the authors to conclude that a trafficking checkpoint
ensures efficient assembly of functional GABA-B receptors.

Schwarz et al. (2000) noted that GABAB1a and GABAB2 (GABBR2) dimerize
via an intracellular C-terminal coil-coiled interaction. They showed
that GABAB1e, which lacks the intracellular C-terminal region,
interacted with the extracellular domain of GABAB2 via a pair of sushi
repeats. GABAB1e competed with GABAB1a for binding to GABAB2. GABAB1a
and GABAB2 bound the antagonist CGP54626A when coexpressed in HEK293
cells, but GABAB1e and GABAB2 did not. Similarly, GABAB1a and GABAB2
could activate G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channels
when coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes or HEK293 cells, but GABAB1e and
GABAB2 could not.

One of the few cortical areas consistently activated by painful stimuli
is the rostral agranular insular cortex (RAIC) where, as in other parts
of the cortex, the neurotransmitter GABA robustly inhibits neuronal
activity. Jasmin et al. (2003) showed that changes in GABA
neurotransmission in the RAIC can raise or lower the pain
threshold--producing analgesia or hyperalgesia, respectively--in freely
moving rats. Locally increasing GABA, by using an enzyme inhibitor or
gene transfer mediated by a viral vector, produced lasting analgesia by
enhancing the descending inhibition of spinal nociceptive neurons.
Selectively activating GABA-B receptor-bearing RAIC neurons produced
hyperalgesia through projections to the amygdala, an area involved in
pain and fear. Whereas most studies focused on the role of cerebral
cortex as the end point of nociceptive processing, Jasmin et al. (2003)
suggested that cerebral cortex activity can change the set point of pain
threshold in a top-down manner.

Schwenk et al. (2010) showed by functional proteomics in rat and mouse
that gamma-aminobutyric acid-B (GABA-B) receptors in the brain are high
molecular mass complexes of GABAB1, GABAB2 (607340), and members of a
subfamily of the KCTD proteins. KCTD proteins 8, 12 (610521), 12B, and
16 (613423) show distinct expression profiles in the brain and associate
tightly with the carboxy terminus of GABAB2 as tetramers. This
coassembly changes the properties of the GABA-B(1,2) core receptor: the
KCTD proteins increase agonist potency and markedly alter the G protein
signaling of the receptors by accelerating onset and promoting
desensitization in a KCTD subtype-specific manner. Schwenk et al. (2010)
concluded that their results established the KCTD proteins as auxillary
subunits of GABA-B receptors that determine the pharmacology and
kinetics of the receptor response.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

For a discussion of a possible association between variation in the
GABBR1 gene and susceptibility to nasopharyngeal carcinoma, see NPCA2
(161550).

ANIMAL MODEL

Using targeted mutagenesis, Schuler et al. (2001) generated mice lacking
the GABBR1 subunit. The GABBR1-null mice were viable but exhibited
spontaneous seizures, hyperalgesia, hyperlocomotor activity, and memory
impairment. Upon GABA-B agonist application, the mice did not show
typical muscle relaxation, hypothermia, or delta EEG waves. The
behavioral findings were paralleled by a loss of all biochemical and
electrophysiologic GABA-B responses. Schuler et al. (2001) concluded
that GABBR1 is an essential component of pre- and postsynaptic GABA-B
receptors.

601313	TITLE *601313 POLYCYSTIN 1; PKD1
;;PKD1 GENE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Polycystin-1, encoded by the PKD1 gene, forms a complex with
polycystin-2 (PKD2; 173910) that regulates multiple signaling pathways
to maintain normal renal tubular structure and function (summary by Song
et al., 2009). Mutations in PKD1 and PKD2 cause polycystic kidney
disease (see 173900 and 613095, respectively).

CLONING

Characterization of the PKD1 gene had been complicated by rearrangements
on chromosome 16 resulting in homologous regions in 16p termed the
homologous gene (HG) area. All but 3.5 kb at the 3-prime end of the PKD1
transcript (which is approximately 14 kb in total) is encoded by a
region reiterated several times in the HG area. The HG region encodes 3
large transcripts of 21 kb (HG-A), 17 kb (HG-B), and 8.5 kb (HG-C), and
although these have 3-prime ends that differ from PKD1, they share
substantial homology to the PKD1 transcript over most of their length.
It was not known, however, whether the HG transcripts produce functional
proteins (summary by Hughes et al., 1995).

To overcome cloning problems caused by the HG region, Hughes et al.
(1995) isolated the full PKD1 gene using an exon-linking strategy. They
took RNA from a cell line containing PKD1 but not the duplicate HG loci
and cloned a cDNA contig of the entire PKD1 transcript. The predicted
PKD1 protein, called polycystin, is a glycoprotein with multiple
transmembrane domains and a cytoplasmic C-tail. The N-terminal
extracellular region of over 2,500 amino acids contains leucine-rich
repeats, a C-type lectin, 16 immunoglobulin-like repeats, and 4 type III
fibronectin-related domains. The findings indicated that polycystin is
an integral membrane protein involved in cell-cell/matrix interactions.

The International Polycystic Kidney Disease Consortium (1995) reported
the complete structure of the PKD1 gene and its protein. The PKD1
transcript contains 46 exons. The 14.5-kb PKD1 transcript encodes a
4,304-amino acid protein that has a novel domain architecture. The
N-terminal half of the protein consists of a mosaic of previously
described domains, including leucine-rich repeats flanked by
characteristic cysteine-rich structures, LDL-A and C-type lectin
domains, and 14 units of a novel 80 amino acid domain. The presence of
these domains suggested that the PKD1 protein is involved in adhesive
protein-protein and protein-carbohydrate interactions in the
extracellular compartment. They proposed a hypothesis that links the
predicted properties of the protein with the phenotypic features of
autosomal dominant PKD.

In a study of PKD1 mRNA with an RNase protection assay, Ward et al.
(1996) found widespread expression in adult tissue, with high levels in
brain and moderate signal in kidney. Expression of the PKD1 protein was
assessed in kidney, using monoclonal antibodies to a recombinant protein
containing the C terminus of the molecule. In fetal and adult kidney,
staining was restricted to epithelial cells. Expression in the
developing nephron was most prominent in mature tubules, with lesser
staining in Bowman capsule and the proximal ureteric bud. In later fetal
and adult kidney, strong staining persisted in cortical tubules with
moderate staining detected in the loops of Henle and collecting ducts.
The authors suggested that the major role of polycystin is in the
maintenance of renal epithelial differentiation and organization from
early fetal life. Polycystin expression, monitored at the mRNA level and
by immunohistochemistry, appeared higher in cystic epithelia, indicating
that the disease does not result from complete loss of the protein.

Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya et al. (1997) assembled an authentic full-length
PKD1 cDNA and demonstrated expression of polycystin in vitro. Polyclonal
antibodies directed against distinct extra- and intracellular domains
specifically immunoprecipitated in vitro translated polycystin. The
panel of antibodies was used to determine localization of polycystin in
renal epithelial and endothelial cell lines and tissues of fetal, adult,
and cystic origins. In normal adult kidney and maturing fetal nephrons,
polycystin expression was confined to epithelial cells of the distal
nephron and vascular endothelial cells. Expression in the proximal
nephron was observed only after injury-induced cell proliferation.
Polycystin expression was confined to ductal epithelium in liver,
pancreas, and breast, and restricted to astrocytes in normal brain. The
investigators found clear evidence for the membrane localization of
polycystin by both tissue sections and by confocal microscopy in
cultured renal and endothelial cells. When cultured cells made cell-cell
contact, polycystin was localized to the lateral membranes of cells in
contact. The data suggested that polycystin probably has a widespread
role in epithelial cell differentiation and maturation and in cell-cell
interactions.

GENE FUNCTION

It had been suggested that the different forms of autosomal dominant
polycystic kidney disease, PKD1 and PKD2, and perhaps a third form
result from defects in interactive factors involved in a common pathway.
The discovery of the genes for the 2 most common forms of ADPKD provided
an opportunity to test this hypothesis. Qian et al. (1997) described a
previously unrecognized coiled-coil domain within the C terminus of the
PKD1 gene product, polycystin-1, and demonstrated that it binds
specifically to the C terminus of the PKD2 gene product, polycystin-2
(173910). Homotypic interactions involving the C terminus of each were
also demonstrated. They showed that naturally occurring pathogenic
mutations of PKD1 and PKD2 disrupt their associations. Qian et al.
(1997) suggested that PKD1 and PKD2 associate physically in vivo and may
be partners of a common signaling cascade involved in tubular
morphogenesis.

Tsiokas et al. (1997) showed that PKD1 and PKD2 interact through their
C-terminal cytoplasmic tails. This interaction results in up-regulation
of PKD1 but not PKD2. Furthermore, the cytoplasmic tail of PKD2 but not
PKD1 forms homodimers through a coiled-coil domain distinct from the
region required for interaction with PKD1. These interactions suggested
that PKD1 and PKD2 may function through a common signaling pathway that
is necessary for normal tubulogenesis and that PKD1 requires the
presence of PKD2 for stable expression.

PKD1 is thought to encode a membrane protein, polycystin-1, involved in
cell-to-cell or cell-matrix interactions, whereas the PKD2 gene product,
polycystin-2, is thought to be a channel protein. Hanaoka et al. (2000)
demonstrated that polycystin-1 and -2 interact to produce new
calcium-permeable nonselective cation currents. Neither polycystin-1 nor
polycystin-2 alone is capable of producing currents. Moreover,
disease-associated mutant forms of either polycystin protein that are
incapable of heterodimerization through the coiled-coil domain do not
result in new channel activity. Hanaoka et al. (2000) also showed that
polycystin-2 is localized in the cell in the absence of polycystin-1,
but is translocated to the plasma membrane in its presence. Thus,
polycystin-1 and -2 coassemble at the plasma membrane to produce a new
channel and to regulate renal tubular morphology and function.

Grimm et al. (2003) found that mammalian polycystin-1 localized to the
cell surface and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in cells that did not
express polycystin-2. However, when the 2 proteins were coexpressed in
the same cell line, polycystin-1 colocalized exclusively with
polycystin-2 in the ER. Further work indicated that the subcellular
localization of polycystin-1 depended on the ratio of polycystin-2 to
polycystin-1 expression and that the localization of polycystin-1 could
be regulated via the relative expression level of polycystin-2.

A large proportion of the extracellular N terminus of polycystin-1 is
composed of 15 tandemly repeated PKD repeats (Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya et
al., 2000). Situated between the last PKD repeat and the first
transmembrane segment is the receptor for 'egg jelly' (REJ) domain,
which was originally described in sea urchin. Immediately following this
domain is a G protein-coupled receptor proteolytic site (GPS) domain
(Delmas et al., 2002). Qian et al. (2002) demonstrated that polycystin-1
undergoes cleavage at the GPS domain in a process that requires the REJ
domain. Most of the N-terminal fragment remains tethered at the cell
surface, although a small amount is secreted. PKD1-associated mutations
in the REJ domain disrupt cleavage, abolish the ability of polycystin-1
to activate signal transducer and activator of transcription-1, and
induce tubulogenesis in vitro. Qian et al. (2002) concluded that
cleavage of polycystin-1 is likely essential for its biologic activity.

Using antibodies raised against various domains of polycystin-1 and
against specific adhesion complex proteins, Scheffers et al. (2000)
determined that polycystin-1 was detected in the cytoplasm as well as
colocalizing with desmosomes of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells,
but not with tight or adherens junctions. They further confirmed the
desmosomal localization using confocal laser scanning and immunoelectron
microscopy. By performing a calcium switch experiment, the authors
demonstrated the sequential reassembly of tight junctions, subsequently
adherens junctions, and finally desmosomes. Polycystin-1 stained the
membrane only after incorporation of desmoplakin (125647) into the
desmosomes, suggesting that membrane-bound polycystin-1 may be important
for cellular signaling or cell adhesion, but not for the assembly of
adhesion complexes.

Because signaling from cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion complexes
regulates cell proliferation and polarity, Huan and van Adelsberg (1999)
speculated that polycystin-1 may interact with these complexes. They
showed that polycystin-1 colocalizes with the cell adhesion molecules
E-cadherin (CDH1; 192090) and alpha- (116805), beta- (116806), and
gamma-catenin. Polycystin-1 coprecipitated with these proteins and
comigrated with them on sucrose density gradients, but it did not
colocalize, coprecipitate, or comigrate with focal adhesion kinase
(600758), a component of the focal adhesion. Huan and van Adelsberg
(1999) concluded that polycystin-1 is in a complex containing E-cadherin
and alpha-, beta-, and gamma-catenin. These observations raised the
question of whether the defects in cell proliferation and cell polarity
observed in ADPKD are mediated by E-cadherin or the catenins.

Rodova et al. (2002) presented evidence for beta-catenin-induced
expression of PKD1. They analyzed the promoter region of PKD1 and
identified numerous transactivating factors, including 4 T-cell factor
(TCF)-binding elements (TBEs). Beta-catenin induced a reporter construct
containing TBE1 6-fold when cotransfected into HEK293T cells, which
express TCF4 (TCF7L2; 602228). Dominant-negative TCF4 or deletion of the
TBE1 sequence inhibited the induction. Gel shift assays confirmed that
TCF4 and beta-catenin could complex with the TBE1 site, and HeLa cells
stably transfected with beta-catenin responded with elevated levels of
endogenous PKD1 mRNA. Rodova et al. (2002) concluded that the PKD1 gene
is a target of the beta-catenin/TCF pathway.

Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya et al. (2000) showed that polycystin-1 is
localized to cell-cell contacts in kidney epithelial cell (MDCK)
cultures. In vitro binding assays demonstrated that the Ig-like domains
XI to XVI form interactions with high affinity, while domains II to V
interact with a lower affinity. Antibodies raised against Ig-like
domains of polycystin-1 disrupted cell-cell interactions in MDCK cell
monolayers. The authors hypothesized that interactions of the Ig-like
repeats of polycystin-1 play an important role in mediating
intercellular adhesion, and that loss of these interactions due to
mutations in polycystin-1 may be an important step in cystogenesis.

Boletta et al. (2000) described a novel cell culture system for studying
how PKD1 regulates the later stages of renal tubular differentiation.
They showed that expression of human PKD1 in MDCK cells slowed their
growth and protected them from programmed cell death. MDCK cells
expressing PKD1 also spontaneously formed branching tubules, while
control cells formed simple cysts. Increased cell proliferation and
apoptosis have been implicated in the pathogenesis of cystic diseases.
This study suggested that PKD1 may function to regulate both pathways,
allowing cells to enter a differentiation pathway that results in tubule
formation.

Bhunia et al. (2002) showed that expression of polycystin-1 activates
the JAK (see 147795)-STAT (see STAT1; 600555) pathway, thereby
upregulating WAF1 (CDKN1A; 116899) and inducing cell cycle arrest in
G0/G1. They found that this process requires polycystin-2 as an
essential cofactor. Mutations that disrupted binding of polycystin-1 and
-2 prevented activation of the pathway. Mouse embryos lacking Pkd1 had
defective Stat1 phosphorylation and Waf1 induction. These results
suggested that 1 function of the complex of polycystin-1 and -2 is to
regulate the JAK-STAT pathway and explained how mutations of either gene
can result in dysregulated growth.

Xu et al. (2001) provided experimental evidence for the interaction of
polycystin-1 with the intermediate filament network. They found that
vimentin (193060) binds the C terminus of mouse polycystin-1 in a yeast
2-hybrid screen of canine kidney cells. Deletion of the coiled-coil
sequence from either peptide abolished the interaction. By GST pull-down
and in vitro filament assembly analyses, they also found the
cytokeratins K8 (KRT8; 148060) and K18 (KRT18; 148070) able to bind the
coiled-coil region of polycystin-1. Immunolocalization of endogenous
polycystin-1 in canine kidney cells revealed discrete nodular junctional
staining that overlapped staining for cytokeratin and desmoplakin
(125647). With use of coimmunoprecipitation and cosedimentation
techniques, Newby et al. (2002) found that 7 to 8% of polycystin-2
colocalizes with polycystin-1 in plasma membrane fractions of both
normal human kidney and mouse kidney cells transgenic for human PKD1.
Polycystin-1 purified from transgenic mouse kidney cells was heavily
N-glycosylated, and both endoglycosidase (Endo-H)-sensitive and mature
Endo-H-resistant forms of the protein were able to interact with
polycystin-2. Newby et al. (2002) interpreted these results to suggest
early association of the 2 proteins in the ER/cis-Golgi prior to complex
glycosylation and insertion into the plasma membrane.

Bukanov et al. (2002) utilized a 3-dimensional MDCK in vitro model of
tubulogenesis and cystogenesis to demonstrate that polycystin-1 is a
novel component of desmosomal junctions of epithelial cells.
Downregulation of polycystin-1 mRNA was detected in cysts as compared to
tubules, leading to altered protein expression and localization. While
polycystin-1 was localized to basolateral membranes of MDCK tubules, it
was only detected in cytoplasmic pools in cystic cells. Polycystin-1 was
not detected in intercellular contacts at early steps of tubulogenesis,
but assumed its basolateral localization at the time of cell
polarization and lumen formation. During a similar morphologic process,
upregulation of polycystin-1 mRNA and protein levels was noted as a
pancreatic ductal epithelial cell line underwent in vitro
differentiation, resulting in dome formation. The authors suggested that
the loss of polycystin-1 from its basolateral location in tubular
epithelium may alter critical pathways controlling normal tubulogenesis
leading to cystic transformation.

ADPKD is associated with altered endothelial-dependent vasodilation and
decreased vascular production of NO. Thus, eNOS (163729) could have a
modifier effect in ADPKD. In order to test this hypothesis, Persu et al.
(2002) genotyped 173 unrelated European ADPKD patients for the
glu298-to-asp (163729.0001), intron 4 VNTR, and -786T-C (163729.0002)
polymorphisms of ENOS and looked for their influence on the age at
end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In 93 males, the glu298-to-asp
polymorphism was associated with a lower age at ESRD. This effect was
confirmed in a subset of males linked to PKD1 and reaching ESRD before
age 45, and by a cumulative renal survival analysis in PKD1-linked
families. Further studies demonstrated that NOS activity was decreased
in renal artery samples from PKD males harboring the asp298 allele, in
association with posttranslational modifications and partial cleavage of
eNOS. No significant effect of the other polymorphisms was found in
males, and no polymorphism influenced the age at ESRD in females. Persu
et al. (2002) concluded that glu298-to-asp is associated with a 5 year
lower mean age at ESRD in a subset of ADPKD males. They hypothesized
that the effect could be due to decreased NOS activity and a partial
cleavage of eNOS, leading to a further decrease in the vascular
production of NO.

Nauli et al. (2003) showed that polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 in mice
codistribute in the primary cilia of kidney epithelium. Cells isolated
from transgenic mice that lacked functional polycystin-1 formed cilia
but did not increase Ca(2+) influx in response to physiologic fluid
flow. Blocking antibodies directed against polycystin-2 similarly
abolished the flow response in wildtype cells as did inhibitors of the
ryanodine receptor (RYR1; 180901), whereas inhibitors of G proteins,
phospholipase C (see 600220), and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors
had no effect. These data suggested that polycystin-1 and polycystin-2
contribute to fluid-flow sensation by the primary cilium in renal
epithelium and that they both function in the same mechanotransduction
pathway. Loss or dysfunction of polycystin-1 or polycystin-2 may
therefore lead to polycystic kidney disease owing to the inability of
cells to sense mechanical cues that normally regulate tissue
morphogenesis. Calvet (2003) reproduced a scanning electron micrograph
of the inside of a collecting-duct cyst from a human autosomal dominant
polycystic kidney, showing a single intercalated cell surrounded by
principal cells, each with 1 or several primary cilia. Although the
cilia on these cells appeared normal, they were presumably functionally
defective because of the mutation in the PKD1 or PKD2 gene.

In mouse kidneys and MDCK cell lines, Chauvet et al. (2004) demonstrated
that polycystin-1 undergoes proteolytic cleavage that releases its
C-terminal tail, which enters the nucleus and initiates signaling
processes. Using a ureteral ligation mouse model, they showed that the
cleavage occurs in vivo in association with alterations in mechanical
stimuli. Polycystin-2 was observed to modulate the signaling properties
of the polycystin-1 C-terminal tail. Chauvet et al. (2004) concluded
that this represents a pathway by which polycystin-1 transmits messages
directly to the nucleus.

Following its nuclear translocation in MDCK cells, Low et al. (2006)
found that the C-terminal tail of human polycystin-1 interacted with
Stat6 (601512) and P100 (602181) and stimulated Stat6-dependent gene
expression. Under normal conditions, Stat6 localized to primary cilia of
renal epithelial cells; however, cessation of apical fluid flow resulted
in its nuclear translocation. Cyst-lining cells in ADPKD exhibited
elevated levels of nuclear STAT6, P100, and the polycystin-1 C-terminal
tail. Exogenous expression of the human polycystin-1 C-terminal tail
resulted in renal cyst formation in zebrafish embryos. Low et al. (2006)
concluded that upregulation of the STAT6/P100 pathway by the
polycystin-1 C-terminal tail leads to the cellular changes
characteristic of renal cysts.

Li et al. (2005) found that polycystin-2 overexpression in human
embryonic kidney cells led to reduced cell proliferation. They showed
that polycystin-2 interacted directly with ID2 (600386) and modulated
the cell cycle via the ID2-CDKN1A-CDK2 (116953) pathway. The
ID2-polycystin-2 interaction caused sequestration of ID2 in the
cytoplasm and required polycystin-1-dependent serine phosphorylation of
polycystin-2. Kidney epithelial cells from a mouse model of PKD1 showed
abnormalities in the cell cycle that could be reversed by RNA
interference-mediated inhibition of Id2 mRNA expression.

Shillingford et al. (2006) found that the cytoplasmic tail of PC1
interacted with tuberin (191092), a regulator of MTOR (FRAP1; 601231)
kinase activity, and that the MTOR pathway was inappropriately activated
in cyst-lining epithelial cells from human ADPKD patients and mouse
models. Rapamycin, an inhibitor of MTOR, was effective in reducing renal
cystogenesis in 2 independent mouse models of PKD, and it appeared to
reduce renal cysts, at least partially, by selective induction of
apoptosis and luminal shedding of cyst-lining epithelial cells.
Advanced-stage ADPKD patients frequently receive a renal transplant
without removal of the affected cystic kidneys, and rapamycin is often
used to prevent transplant rejection. Shillingford et al. (2006) found
that patients treated with rapamycin had a statistically significant
reduction in native polycystic kidney size over a period of 24 months
compared with patients treated with other antirejection drugs.

Sharif-Naeini et al. (2009) showed that mouse Pkd1 and Pkd2, which they
called Trpp1 and Trpp2, could regulate stretch-activated ion channels
and were involved in pressure sensing.

MAPPING

Reeders et al. (1985) showed that the PKD1 locus is closely linked to
the alpha-globin locus (HBA1; 141800) on 16p (lod = 25.85, theta = 0.05,
99% confidence limits = 2-11 cM). In establishing this linkage, they
used a highly polymorphic region about 8 kb beyond the 3-prime end of
the alpha-globin cluster (3-prime-HVR = 3-prime-hypervariable region).
In the Oxford data (Reeders, 1985), APKD versus phosphoglycolate
phosphatase (PGP; 172280) showed a lod score of 8.21 at theta = 0.0. PGP
and HBA showed a lod score of 11.61 at theta = 0.0. In 13 South Wales
kindreds, Lazarou et al. (1987) found a maximum lod score of 24.187 at a
recombination fraction of 0.03 for linkage between PKD1 and
alpha-globin. Despite phenotypic heterogeneity, they found no evidence
of linkage heterogeneity.

Watson et al. (1987) found tight linkage of APKD and PGP; the maximum
likelihood value of the recombination fraction was 0.0 with a lod score
of 5.5. Together with the APKD versus HVR linkage data, these findings
suggested to them that APKD and PGP are on the 5-prime side of the
alpha-globin cluster. The polarity of the HBAC gene cluster viz-a-viz
the centromere is unknown. The recombination fraction for the
3-prime-HVR and APKD is somewhat greater in males than in females
(Reeders, 1986)--an anomalous finding. Reeders et al. (1985) found no
definite recombination between PGP and APKD. HBAC is distal to APKD but
whether PGP is proximal or distal to APKD is unknown. The evidence on
location of HBAC was conflicting, with assignments from 16p13.11 to
16p13.33. Reeders et al. (1988) described an array of linked markers
that bracket the PKD1 locus. Germino et al. (1990) demonstrated a DNA
marker, D16S84, that showed no recombination with PKD1 in 201
informative meioses.

Pound et al. (1992) presented evidence for linkage disequilibrium
between PKD1 and D16S94. Breuning et al. (1990) further defined the
location of markers on 16p in the vicinity of the PKD1 locus. Harris et
al. (1991) identified closely linked microsatellite polymorphisms that
could be used in a PCR-based assay for a rapid, inexpensive, and
nonradioactive method of linkage analysis.

Gal et al. (1989) studied 10 families in which early manifestation of
the disorder was a frequent finding. In all families studied, close
linkage was observed between the chromosome 16 alpha-globin marker and
the APKD locus. They concluded that there is no evidence for genetic
heterogeneity of APKD in families with early- and later-onset disease.
In 28 northern European pedigrees from England, Scotland, Holland, and
eastern Finland, Reeders et al. (1987) found no evidence of
heterogeneity of the linkage of PKD1 with alpha-globin. (The recessive
form of early-onset polycystic kidney disease is probably not linked to
HBA (Reeders, 1986).)

Zerres et al. (1993) also investigated 79 children with early
manifestation of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD).
They belonged to 64 families (64 index patients and 15 affected sibs).
Early manifestation was defined as clinical manifestations
(hypertension, proteinuria, impaired renal function, palpably enlarged
kidneys) occurring before the age of 15 years. A strong familial
clustering for early manifesting ADPKD was found; out of the total of 65
sibs of the 64 index patients, 15 showed comparably early manifestation.
Another 10 symptom-free children were diagnosed sonographically as
having ADPKD before the age of 18 years. The authors noted that high
recurrence risk to sibs has important implications for genetic
counseling and clinical care of affected families.

Among the same 17 families reported by Bear et al. (1984, 1992), Parfrey
et al. (1990) found that polycystic kidney disease cosegregated with
polymorphic DNA markers flanking the PKD1 locus in 10; in 2 families
cosegregation did not occur, and in 5 families linkage could not be
determined because of uninformativeness of the markers.

Ryynanen et al. (1987) did linkage studies in a 4-generation Finnish
family with polycystic kidney disease; all affected members of the
extended pedigree were asymptomatic and none had developed renal
failure. They showed that the mutation in this family was closely linked
to the alpha-globin cluster. This might be an allelic disorder. Using
DNA from a set of multigenerational families from CEPH (Centre d'etude
polymorphisme humaine, Paris), Keith et al. (1987) constructed a genetic
map of chromosome 16 based on 40 polymorphic DNA markers. The map
spanned 142 cM in males, somewhat larger than the 108 cM previously
estimated by chiasma counts. Males had higher recombination fractions
near the alpha-globin gene cluster, but females showed higher
recombination in other regions.

Germino et al. (1992) demonstrated that the PKD1 gene lies within an
extremely CpG-rich 750-kb segment of 16p13.3. Its genetic localization
with respect to physically mapped markers in this segment was refined by
Somlo et al. (1992).

In the Spanish population, Peral et al. (1993) typed 31 families from
different geographic areas using marker loci flanking PKD1 on 16p.
Multilocus linkage analysis indicated that in 26 families the disease
resulted from PKD1 mutations, whereas in 3 families it resulted from
mutations in a locus other than PKD1; 2 other families were not
informative. Using the HOMOG test, they estimated that PKD1-linked
mutations were responsible for 85% of families with PKD in Spain.

The 400-Mb genome of the Japanese pufferfish, Fugu rubripes, is
relatively free of repetitive DNA and contains genes with small introns
at high density. Sandford et al. (1996) demonstrated that the genes that
are mutant in polycystic kidney disease-1 and tuberous sclerosis-2
(TSC2; 191092) are conserved in the Fugu genome where they are tightly
linked. In addition, sequences homologous to the SSTR5 gene (182455)
were identified 5-prime to PKD1, defining a larger syntenic region. As
in genomes of mouse and human, the Fugu TSC2 and PKD1 genes are adjacent
in a tail-to-tail orientation.

- PKD1 Pseudogenes

A large part of the PKD1 gene is duplicated in an unknown number of
homologous genes (HG) which are located on chromosome 16p13.1 and share
approximately 95% homology with the PKD1 gene (Hughes et al., 1995).
Bogdanova et al. (2001) examined the expression of 5 of these homologous
genes located proximal to PKD1. They used RT-PCR of total RNA and mRNA
associated within polysomes isolated from a human glioblastoma cell line
in which polycystins are well expressed. Analysis of the products
suggested that the homologs produce mRNA species with suboptimal start
codons and that these mRNA species are not translated. Bogdanova et al.
(2001) concluded that the homologs are pseudogenes.

PATHOGENESIS

To elucidate the molecular pathways that modulate renal cyst growth in
ADPKD, Song et al. (2009) used cDNA microarray gene profiling of cysts
of different size and minimally cystic tissue (MCT) from 5 PKD1 human
polycystic kidneys. The authors found downregulation of kidney
epithelial-restricted genes (e.g., nephron segment-specific markers and
cilia-associated cystic genes such as HNF1B (189907), PKHD1 (606702),
IFT88 (600595), and CYS1) in the PKD1 renal cysts. Upregulated genes in
PKD1 cysts included those associated with renal development,
mitogen-mediated proliferation, cell cycle progression,
epithelial-mesenchymal transition, hypoxia, aging, and
immune/inflammatory responses. The authors suggested that upregulated
signaling of Wnt/beta-catenin, pleiotropic growth factors, such as VEGF
(192240), and G protein-coupled receptors, such as PTGER2 (176804), was
associated with renal cystic growth. By integrating these pathways with
a number of dysregulated networks of transcription factors, including
SRF (600589), Song et al. (2009) suggested that epithelial
dedifferentiation accompanied by aberrant activation and crosstalk of
specific signaling pathways may be required for PKD1 cyst growth and
disease progression.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hughes et al. (1995) determined that the 14,148-bp PKD1 transcript is
distributed among 46 exons spanning 52 kb.

Lantinga-van Leeuwen et al. (2005) determined that the promoter region
of both the PKD1 and PKD2 genes are TATA-less, but they have binding
sites for E2F (see 189971), EGRF (see EGR1; 128990), ETS (see 600541),
MZF1 (194550), SP1 (189906), and ZBP89 (601867). The PKD1 promoter also
contains an E box, MINI (muscle initiator sequence) motif, and a binding
site for AP2 (107580). Deletion studies of the mouse Pkd1 promoter
identified a 280-bp fragment capable of driving reporter gene
expression, whereas reporter constructs containing larger fragments of
the promoter showed lower activity. Mutating a potential E2f-binding
site within the 280-bp fragment diminished reporter activity, suggesting
a role for E2F in regulating cell cycle-dependent expression of the PKD1
gene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The European Polycystic Kidney Disease Consortium (1994) isolated a gene
encoding a 14-kb transcript that was disrupted by a chromosome
translocation in a family with PKD1. Indeed, the unusual Portuguese
family had both PKD and tuberous sclerosis (TSC2; 191092), which maps to
the same region of 16p. The mother had a balanced translocation, 46,XX
t(16;22)(p13.3;q11.21), which was inherited by her daughter. The son, on
the other hand, had an unbalanced karyotype 45,XY with monosomy for
16pter-p13.3 as well as for 22pter-q11.21. This individual had the
clinical phenotype of tuberous sclerosis which was thought to be due to
the fact that the TSC2 locus located within 16p13.3 was deleted in the
unbalanced karyotype. The mother and the daughter with the balanced
translocation had the clinical features of PKD1, while the parents of
the mother were cytogenetically normal, with no clinical features of
tuberous sclerosis and no renal cysts on ultrasound examination. The
location of the breakpoint in the balanced translocation was more than
20 kb proximal to the TSC2 locus. The consortium isolated a gene
spanning the breakpoint and designated it PBP (for 'polycystic
breakpoint'). They then identified mutations in the PBP gene in other
patients with PKD1. The first mutation found was a 5.5-kb genomic
deletion within the 3-prime end of the PBP gene in an affected woman and
in paraffin-embedded tissue from her affected father (deceased at the
time of report). The second rearrangement detected was a 2-kb genomic
deletion within the PBP gene which was found to have a frameshift
deletion of 446 bp (between basepairs 1746 and 2192). This was a de novo
mutation. Sequencing of genomic DNA in another patient demonstrated a
G-to-C transition at the +1 position of the splice donor site following
the 135-bp exon. The splicing defect resulted in an in-frame deletion of
135-bp from the PBP transcript (basepairs 3696 to 3831). A fourth
patient was described in which both the TSC2 gene and the PKD1 gene were
deleted. Further study indicated that the deletion extended over
approximately 100 kb and deleted most, if not all, of the PKD1 gene. By
'zoo blotting,' the consortium demonstrated that the PKD1 gene is
conserved in other mammalian species, including horse, dog, pig, and
rodents. No related sequences were seen by hybridization at normal
stringency in chicken, frog, or fruit fly. Wunderle et al. (1994)
pointed out that 3 explanations are classically used to account for
dominant inheritance in a disorder such as PKD1: haploinsufficiency,
gain-of-function mutations (including dominant negative effects), and
2-hit mechanisms (a second somatic mutation being required to give rise
to defective cells).

Harris et al. (1990) found that the region around the PKD1 locus is
unusually rich in CpG dinucleotides. In a search for the gene that is
mutant in polycystic kidney disease, Gillespie et al. (1991)
concentrated on CpG islands in a region between 2 markers that flank the
PKD1 locus and are separated by less than 750 kb. One of the genes so
marked, ATP6C (108745), was isolated from HeLa and cultured cystic
kidney epithelial cell cDNA libraries. It was found to encode a
155-amino acid peptide having 4 putative transmembrane domains. The
corresponding transcript was found in all tissues tested but was most
abundant in brain and kidney. The deduced amino acid sequence showed 93%
similarity to part of the proton channel of vacuolar H(+)-ATPase.
Because of the possible role of a mutated proton channel in the
pathogenesis of cystic disease, Gillespie et al. (1991) sequenced cDNAs
corresponding to both alleles of an affected individual but found no
differences in the deduced amino acid sequence. Moreover, transcript
size and abundance were not altered in cystic kidney.

Peral et al. (1995) sought mutations in the PKD1 gene in this disorder.
Analysis of 3 regions in the 3-prime part of the gene revealed 2
mutations that occurred by a novel mechanism. Both were deletions (of 18
or 20 bp) within the same 75-bp intron and, although these deletions did
not disrupt the splice donor or acceptor sites at the boundary of the
intron, they nevertheless resulted in aberrant splicing. Two different
transcripts were produced in each case; one included the normally
deleted intron while the other had a 66-bp deletion due to activation of
a cryptic 5-prime splice site. No normal product was generated from the
deletion-mutant gene. Peral et al. (1995) speculated that aberrant
splicing probably occurred because the deletion made the intron too
small for spliceosome assembly using the authentic splice sites. They
also identified a 9-bp direct repeat within the intron, which probably
facilitated the intronic deletion by promoting misalignment of sequence.

At a point when only 7 mutations in the PKD1 gene had been described,
Peral et al. (1996) reported a systematic screen covering nearly 80% of
the approximately 2.5 kb of translated transcript that is encoded by a
single-copy DNA. They identified and characterized 6 novel mutations
that, together with the previously described changes, amounted to a
detection rate of 10 to 15% in the population studied. Study of the PKD1
mutation search in the PKD1 gene is complicated by the fact that most of
the gene lies in a genomic region reiterated several times elsewhere on
chromosome 16. The results of the study of Peral et al. (1996) have
important implications for genetic diagnosis of PKD1 because they
indicate that most of the mutations lie within the duplicated area which
is difficult to study. They provided a diagram of the structure of the
polycystin protein with an indication of the site of the mutations
described to date. Comparison of the phenotypes of patients with large
frameshifting or terminating changes and those with more subtle in-frame
changes showed no obvious differences, suggesting that they may all be
inactivating changes. They cited evidence of an alternatively spliced
form of PKD1 that contains an additional exon in intron 16. Inclusion of
this exon would change the reading frame and result in the production of
a much smaller protein product. Hence they suggested that all PKD1
mutations may be inactivating, but those in typical families disrupt
just the full-length polycystin, whereas those associated with large
deletions disrupt both forms of the PKD1 protein, resulting in a more
severe, early-onset disease.

Neophytou et al. (1996) identified an intragenic polymorphism in the
coding region of the gene. Alanine at position 4091 is encoded by either
GCA or GCG. In the Cypriot population this polymorphism had a
heterozygosity of 35%. Neophytou et al. (1996) reported that this
polymorphism is readily detectable with the enzyme Bsp1286I. They
considered this intragenic polymorphism to be highly useful in
informative families, given the instability of the PKD1 region. They
also identified a 12258T-A mutation that led to premature termination of
translation (601313.0006).

Reeders (1992) put forward an interesting 2-hit mutational hypothesis
for PKD1. He pointed out the several unusual features such as the
absence of detectable abnormalities in most nephrons; even in the
end-stage disease, less than 10% of the roughly 1 million nephrons in
each kidney contain cysts. Furthermore, any segment of the nephron, from
the glomerulus to the collecting duct, may harbor a cyst. The hypothesis
suggests that at the sites of cyst formation, a somatic mutation occurs
in the chromosome 16 that does not carry the inherited mutation. A
prediction of the 2-hit model is that renal cysts will occasionally be
found in persons without an inherited predisposition as a result of 2
somatic mutations occurring in a single cell. One or 2 renal cysts are a
common radiologic finding in the general population and the probability
of finding a cyst in an individual does, as predicted, rise with age.
The 2-hit model predicts that the number of cysts would increase with
age in PKD1.

ADPKD is characterized by progressive cyst formation in a variety of
organs outside the kidney, including liver and pancreas. Using DNA from
the liver cysts of 2 donors with ADPKD, Watnick et al. (1998) showed
that intragenic, somatic mutations (frameshifts, nonsense codons, severe
splicing mutations, and loss of heterozygosity) are common in hepatic
cysts. All pathogenic mutations were shown to have altered the
previously normal copy of the gene. These data extend the 2-hit model of
cystogenesis to include a second focal manifestation of the disease.

Qian et al. (1996) developed a novel method for isolating renal cystic
epithelia from single cysts and showed that individual renal cysts in
PKD1 are monoclonal. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was discovered within
a subset of cysts for 2 closely linked polymorphic markers located
within the PKD1 gene. Genetic analysis revealed that it was the normal
haplotype that was lost. The findings provided a molecular explanation
for the focal nature of cyst formation and a probable mechanism whereby
mutations cause disease. The high rate at which 'second hits' must occur
to account for the large number of cysts observed suggested to Qian et
al. (1996) that unique structural features of the PKD1 gene may be
responsible for its mutability. (This is a remarkable example of the
Knudson mechanism which has been established in a considerable number of
neoplasms. VAM.) They previously reported an extremely unusual 2.5-kb
polypyrimidine tract within intron 21 of the PKD1 gene that they
postulated as being responsible for the gene's increased rate of
mutation (Burn et al., 1995). Qian et al. (1996) postulated that the
polypyrimidine tract may cause ongoing errors in its
transcription-coupled repair, thus resulting in a high frequency of
somatic mutation. Thus, they concluded that PKD1 is a recessive
disorder, when viewed at the level of the individual renal lesions.

Mutation screening of the PKD1 gene is complicated by the large
transcript size (more than 14 kb) and by reiteration of the genomic area
encoding 75% of the protein on the same chromosome. The sequence
similarity between the duplicated region precludes specific analysis for
mutations and consequently mutations were first identified in the unique
3-prime region of PKD1. Peral et al. (1997) developed a novel anchored
RT-PCR approach to amplify specifically duplicated regions of PKD1,
employing 1 primer situated within the single-copy region and 1 within
the reiterated area. This strategy was incorporated in a mutation screen
of 100 patients for more than half of the PKD1 exons (exons 22 to 46;
37% of the coding region), including 11 (exons 22 to 32) within the
duplicated gene region, by use of the protein-truncation test (PTT).
Sixty of the patients were also screened for missense changes, by use of
the nonisotopic RNase cleavage assay (NIRCA), in exons 23 to 36. In this
way, Peral et al. (1997) identified 11 mutations, 6 within the
duplicated region: 3 stop mutations, 3 frameshifting deletions of 1
nucleotide, 2 splicing defects, and 3 possible missense changes. Each
mutation was detected in just 1 family, although 1 had been described
previously; no mutation hotspot was identified. The nature and
distribution of mutations, plus the lack of a clear phenotype/genotype
correlation, suggested that the mutations may inactivate the molecule.
Peral et al. (1997) recommended RT-PCR/PTT as a rapid and efficient
method to detect PKD1 mutations and differentiate pathogenic changes
from polymorphisms.

Constantinides et al. (1997) reported a new amino acid polymorphism,
ala/val4058, with allelic frequencies of 0.88 and 0.12, respectively,
and a heterozygosity of 0.23, in the Greek and Greek-Cypriot
populations. The val4058 polymorphism occurred on the background of the
ala4091-G allele of the ala4091-A/G polymorphism, previously described
by Neophytou et al. (1996) and Peral et al. (1996). Neither polymorphism
was observed in 44 Japanese subjects, leading Constantinides et al.
(1997) to suggest that these polymorphic alleles would be useful for
linkage analysis only in specific ethnic groups.

A major challenge faced by researchers attempting to do a complete
mutation analysis of the PKD1 gene is the presence of several homologous
loci, also located on chromosome 16. Because the sequence of PKD1 and
its homologs is nearly identical in the 5-prime region of the gene, most
traditional approaches to mutation analysis cannot distinguish sequence
variants occurring uniquely in PKD1. Although linkage information
indicates that mutations in PKD1 account for approximately 85% of all
autosomal dominant PKD, relatively few mutations were identified in the
4-year period following the identification of the gene in 1994, and most
were clustered in the unique portion of the gene. Approximately 70% of
the length of the gene is present in at least 3 faithful copies at
16p13.1. The duplicated region extends from exon 1 to intron 34 and
includes all intervening sequences. The PKD1 copies are transcribed but
their respective mRNA molecules can be distinguished from authentic PKD1
transcripts on the basis of size. Furthermore, bisecting intron 21 of
PKD1 is an unusual polypyrimidine tract of approximately 2.5 kb. This
element is also present in the PKD1 homologs.

To study the duplicated region of PKD1, Watnick et al. (1997) devised a
novel strategy that depends on long-range PCR and a single gene-specific
primer from the unique region of the gene to amplify a PKD1-specific
template that spans exons 23 to 34. This 10-kb template, amplified from
genomic DNA, can be employed for mutation analysis using a wide range of
sequence-based approaches. Using this long-range PCR strategy to screen
for sequence variants with heteroduplex analysis, Watnick et al. (1997)
identified several affected individuals with clusters of basepair
substitutions in exons 23 and 25. In 2 patients, these changes,
identified in exon 23, would be predicted to result in multiple amino
acid substitutions in a short stretch of the protein. This unusual
clustering of basepair substitutions suggested that mutation may result
from unique structural features of the PKD1 gene. The observation that
renal cysts are due to somatic mutations and the high frequency of
'second hits' implied by this in hereditary polycystic kidney disease
also suggests an unusual mechanism of mutation. Watnick et al. (1997)
observed that the PKD1 gene has 3 long polypyrimidine tracts within
introns 1, 21, and 22, the longest of which is 2.5 kb in intron 21. The
tract in intron 21 was the longest polypyrimidine tract sequenced to
that time and contains 23 mirror repeats with stem lengths of at least
10 nucleotides. They predicted that the mirror repeats are likely to
form H-DNA structures composed of a triple helix conformation under
appropriate conditions. Triple helix structures can promote localized
mutagenesis in cultured cells. The unusual pattern of clustered multiple
basepair substitutions is consistent with that associated with triple
helix formation.

Roelfsema et al. (1997) reduced the problem in mutation detection posed
by the HG region by use of the protein-truncation test. They identified
8 novel mutations, 7 of which were located in the repeated part of the
PKD1 gene (e.g., 601313.0008).

Watnick et al. (1997) devised a strategy for mutation detection in the
duplicated region of PKD1. The method used 1 gene-specific primer, PKD1,
as an anchor in combination with a primer from the duplicated portion to
amplify PKD1-specific templates that are approximately 10 kb long and
include exons 23 to 34 or exons 23 to 38. They demonstrated that the
3-prime long-range PCR product (3-prime-LR) is PKD1 specific once it has
been diluted sufficiently to remove genomic contamination and could be
used for nested PCR of any exon contained within it. These products
could then be analyzed for PKD1 mutations with conventional methods such
as heteroduplex or single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP)
analysis. Using this technique, Watnick et al. (1997) identified an
unusual cluster of nearly identical basepair transitions involving exon
23 in 2 unrelated individuals. These changes were predicted to result in
multiple nonconservative amino acid substitutions in a short stretch of
the protein. Both the unusual pattern of these mutations and their
apparent independent origin prompted Watnick et al. (1998) to test
whether these sequence differences could have arisen through gene
conversion since pseudogenes had been known to be reservoirs for
mutations by this mechanism for a number of other diseases, such as
Gaucher disease and congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase
deficiency (201910). Using changes in restriction digest patterns, they
showed that these sequence substitutions were also present in a
rodent-human somatic cell hybrid that contained only the PKD1 homologs.
Moreover, these changes were also detected in total DNA from several
affected and unaffected individuals that did not harbor this mutation in
their PKD1 gene copy. Although PKD1 and CYP21, the gene mutant in
congenital adrenal hyperplasia, resemble each other in some respects,
they differ in the number and proximity of their homologous loci. The
PKD1 gene is replicated in at least 3 copies that are located megabases
away, while CYP21 has only 1 tandemly repeated unit. Multiple adjacent
nucleotide substitutions have been described in the von Willebrand
factor gene (VWF; 613160) on chromosome 12 that mimic the sequence of
its pseudogene located on chromosome 22 (Eikenboom et al., 1994). Murti
et al. (1994) demonstrated gene conversion between unlinked sequences in
the germline of mice. Gene conversion, first studied extensively in
yeast, is the nonreciprocal exchange of genetic information. Gene
conversion and recombination may be related processes that involve
pairing of homologous sequences except that in gene conversion, genetic
information is transferred from the donor gene to the recipient without
the donor being modified in the process. The fact that both PKD1 and its
homologs contain unusual polypyrimidine tracts that are situated in
adjacent introns may promote nonreciprocal recombination leading to gene
conversion. They postulated that these polypyrimidine tracts form triple
helices under appropriate conditions that could conceivably contribute
to mutagenesis by more than 1 mechanism. Gene conversion may also
account for the apparently high mutation rate, both somatic and
germline, in the PKD1 gene. A high germline mutation is suggested by the
frequency of polycystic kidney disease, which is estimated to be as high
as 1 in 1,000 individuals, and by the high somatic mutation rate that is
required, each with a separate second mutational event. It is possible,
furthermore, that somatic mutation in the PKD1 gene represents the
second hit in the case of the multiple cysts of PKD2 and PKD3 (Germino,
1998).

Thomas et al. (1999) concluded that when long-range PCR is applied to
identify mutations in the duplicated part of the PKD1 gene, coupled with
existing mutation detection methods, virtually the whole of this large,
complex gene can be screened for mutations. By means of a PKD1-specific
primer in intron 1, they used an approximately 13.6-kb PCR product that
includes exons 2 to 15 of the PKD1 gene to search for mutations by
direct sequence analysis. This region contains the majority of the
predicted extracellular domains of the PKD1 gene product, polycystin,
including the 16 novel PKD domains that have similarity to
immunoglobulin-like domains found in many cell adhesion molecules and
cell surface receptors. In 24 unrelated patients, 7 novel mutations were
found: 2 deletions (1 of 3 kb and the other of 28 bp), 1 single-base
insertion, and 4 nucleotide substitutions (1 splice site, 1 nonsense,
and 2 missense). Five of these mutations were predicted to cause a
prematurely truncated protein. Two coding and 18 silent polymorphisms
were also found.

It is known that several of the most severe complications of autosomal
dominant polycystic kidney disease, such as intracranial aneurysms,
cluster in families. Watnick et al. (1999) described a cluster of 4 bp
in exon 15 that is unique to PKD1. Forward and reverse PKD1-specific
primers were designed in this location to amplify regions of the gene
from exons 11 to 21 by use of long-range PCR. The 2 templates described
were used to analyze 35 pedigrees selected for study because they
included individuals with either intracranial aneurysms and/or very
early-onset disease. Watnick et al. (1999) identified 8 novel truncating
mutations, 2 missense mutations not found in a panel of controls, and
several informative polymorphisms. Many of the polymorphisms were also
present in the homologous loci on chromosome 16, supporting the idea
that they may serve as a reservoir for genetic variability in the PKD1
gene. To their surprise, Watnick et al. (1999) found that 3
independently ascertained pedigrees had an identical 2-bp deletion in
exon 15 (601313.0014).

Rossetti et al. (2001) developed methods to amplify all of the PKD1
coding area and screened for mutations in 131 unrelated patients with
ADPKD, using the protein-truncation test and direct sequencing.
Mutations were identified in 57 families, and, including 24 previously
characterized changes from this cohort, a detection rate of 52.3% was
achieved in 155 families. Mutations were distributed through all areas
of the gene, from exon 1 to exon 46, with no clear hotspot identified.
There was no significant difference in mutation frequency between the
single-copy and duplicated areas of the gene, but mutations were more
than twice as frequent in the 3-prime half of the gene, compared with
the 5-prime half. Most mutations were predicted to truncate the protein
through nonsense mutations (32%), insertions or deletions (29.6%), or
splicing changes (6.2%), although the figures were biased by the methods
employed, and, in sequenced areas, approximately 50% of all mutations
were missense or in-frame. Other studies had suggested that gene
conversion may be a significant cause of mutation in PKD1, but only 3 of
69 different mutations matched the PKD1-like HG sequence. A relatively
high rate of new PKD1 mutations was calculated, 1.8 x 10(-5) mutations
per generation, consistent with the many different mutations identified
(69 in 81 pedigrees) and suggesting significant selection against mutant
alleles. In this study, the mutation detection rate of more than 50% was
comparable to that achieved for other large multiexon genes and showed
the feasibility of DNA diagnosis in this disorder.

Perrichot et al. (1999) used denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis
(DGGE) to scan for mutations in the nonduplicated region of the PKD1
gene in a large cohort of 146 French unrelated ADPKD patients. They
identified several novel mutations: 3 frameshift mutations, 2 nonsense
mutations, 2 missense mutations, 1 insertion in a frame of 9
nucleotides, 3 intronic variations, and several polymorphisms. One of
these mutations, W4139X (601313.0015), was said by Perrichot et al.
(1999) to be the fourth reported de novo mutation in the PKD1 gene.
Anticipation was suspected in 1 family in which the diagnosis was made
in utero in a member of the most recent generation. This study was
undertaken in patients in Brittany, a Celtic area in the western part of
France. A previous epidemiologic study in Brittany by Simon et al.
(1996) found the frequency of the disease to be close to 1 in 1,100.

Koptides et al. (2000) provided the first direct genetic evidence that
polycystins 1 and 2 interact, perhaps as part of a larger complex. In
cystic DNA from a kidney of a patient with autosomal dominant PKD1, the
authors showed somatic mutations not only in the PKD1 gene of certain
cysts, but also in the PKD2 gene of others, generating a
transheterozygous state with mutations in both genes. The mutation in
the PKD1 gene was of germinal nature and the mutation in the PKD2 gene
was of somatic nature. The authors stated that to their knowledge this
was the first demonstration of the transheterozygous model as a
mechanism for human disease development. In Drosophila melanogaster, a
transheterozygous situation for 2 recessive mutations, the multiple wing
hair and flare-3, has been exploited by Delgado-Rodriguez et al. (1999)
for developing the wing spot test, which identifies genotoxic
substances.

Koptides and Deltas (2000) reviewed the molecular genetics and molecular
pathogenesis of ADPKD. They reviewed data that support or possibly
contradict the 2-hit hypothesis, and other data that support the
transheterozygous model for cystogenesis.

Using exon-by-exon SSCP analysis on long-range PCR products, Bouba et
al. (2001) performed a systematic screening of part of the duplicated
region of the PKD1 gene in a cohort of 53 Hellenic ADPKD families from
Greece and Cyprus. The region screened (exons 16-34) represented 23% of
the PKD1 coding sequence, and 8 probable disease mutations were
identified: 5 deletions and 3 missense mutations. In one family, a 3-bp
and an 8-bp deletion in exons 20 and 21, respectively, were coinherited
on the same PKD1 chromosome, causing disease in the mother and 3 sons.
Eleven intragenic polymorphisms were also detected, representing neutral
or coding variants, confirming previous suggestions that the PKD1 gene
is prone to mutations.

Pei et al. (2001) reported studies of an extensively affected
Newfoundland family in which it appeared that there was bilineal
polycystic kidney disease from independently segregating PKD1 and PKD2
mutations. Affected members who were heterozygous for mutations in both
the PKD1 and PKD2 genes (transheterozygotes) had a more severe clinical
course than those with mutations in only 1 of the genes.

In 17 unrelated Australian individuals with PKD1-linked autosomal
dominant PKD, McCluskey et al. (2002) screened for disease-causing
mutations in the duplicated region of the PKD1 gene. They identified 12
novel probably pathogenic DNA variants. Defects in the duplicated region
of the gene accounted for 63% of the patients. Together with the
previously detected mutations in the 3-prime region of the gene, the
study achieved an overall mutation detection rate of 74%. They also
detected 31 variants (9 novel and 22 previously published) that did not
segregate with the disease and were considered to be polymorphisms.
Three of the 9 novel polymorphisms were missense mutations with a
predicted effect on protein conformation, emphasizing the problems of
interpretation in PKD1 mutation screening.

Inoue et al. (2002) examined PKD1 mutations in Japanese ADPKD patients.
Six novel chain-terminating mutations were detected. They concluded that
most PKD1 mutations in Japanese ADPKD patients are novel and definitely
pathogenic. One pedigree did not link to either PKD1 or PKD2.

Eo et al. (2002) described 3 novel mutations of the PKD1 gene in Korean
patients. In this study, the clinical data from affected individuals and
from previously reported Korean PKD1 mutations showed that patients with
frameshift or nonsense mutations were more prone to develop end-stage
renal failure than those with missense mutations.

Familial clustering of intracranial aneurysms suggests that genetic
factors are important in the etiology of ADPKD. Rossetti et al. (2003)
characterized mutations in 58 ADPKD families with vascular
complications; 51 were PKD1 (88%) and 7 were PKD2 (12%). The median
position of the PKD1 mutation was significantly further 5-prime in the
vascular population than in the 87 control pedigrees (amino acid
position 2163 vs 2773, p = 0.0034). Subsets of the vascular population
with aneurysmal rupture, early rupture, or families with more than 1
vascular case had median mutation locations even further 5-prime.

Gout et al. (2007) retrospectively reviewed published variants in the
PKD1 genes and detected errors in 39 of 771 variants (5.06%). All arose
from human processing mistakes. As peer-reviewed publication is no
safeguard for those considering the clinical significance of an unknown
variant, the authors suggested that reporting of new variants for the
proposed Human Variome Project should employ both automated reporting
and expert scrutiny. Errors were grouped into 3 categories:
misassignment, miscounting, and typographical. A table of erroneous
variant reports with corrections was published.

ANIMAL MODEL

Himmelbauer et al. (1991, 1992) mapped 2 human cDNA clones, derived from
the region between markers flanking PKD1, in the mouse genome. From the
study of recombinant inbred strains and of somatic cell hybrids, they
found that the PKD1 region markers mapped to mouse chromosome 17.

Aziz et al. (1993, 1994) demonstrated that the mouse Ke6 gene (601417)
is involved in the manifestation of polycystic kidney disease in 2
different murine models of PKD. The HKE4 (601416) and HKE6 genes are
located in the major histocompatibility complex in mouse and human, on
mouse chromosome 17 and human chromosome 6, respectively.

Olsson et al. (1996) mapped the Pkd1 locus to mouse chromosome 17 using
somatic cell hybrids, B x D recombinant inbred strains, and fluorescence
in situ hybridization. The gene is located within a previously defined
conserved synteny group that includes the mouse homolog of tuberous
sclerosis-2 (TSC2; 191092) and is linked to the alpha-globin pseudogene.
Like their human counterparts, the mouse Tsc2 and Pkd1 genes are
arranged in a tail-to-tail orientation with a distance of only 63 bp
between the polyadenylation signals of the 2 genes.

Lohning et al. (1997) studied the mouse version of the PKD1 gene. The
predicted protein is 79% identical to human PKD1 and contains most of
the domains identified in the human sequence. As in the human, the mouse
homolog is transcribed from a unique gene and there are no transcribed,
closely related copies. At the junction of exons 12 and 13, several
different splicing variants were identified that lead to a predicted
protein that could be secreted. These forms were found predominantly in
newborn brain, while in kidney the transcript homologous to the
previously described human RNA predominated.

Lu et al. (1997) introduced into mice by homologous recombination a Pkd1
truncation mutation that mimicked a mutation found in human ADPKD.
Heterozygotes had no discernible phenotype, whereas homozygotes died
during the perinatal period with massively enlarged cystic kidneys,
pancreatic ductal cysts, and pulmonary hypoplasia. Renal cyst formation
began at embryonic day 15.5 in proximal tubules and progressed rapidly
to replace the entire renal parenchyma. The timing of cyst formation
suggested that full-length polycystin is required for normal
morphogenesis during elongation and maturation of tubular structures in
the kidney and pancreas. Hepatic and pancreatic cysts are rather common
in ADPKD (Gabow, 1993), but are rarely of clinical significance. The
pulmonary hypoplasia that occurred in the mice and is found in
polycystic disease in childhood probably results from oligohydramnios
and abdominal distention produced by renal enlargement. Although liver
cysts occur in about 30% of patients with ADPKD, surprisingly none were
observed in the homozygous mutant mice. There were also no abnormalities
in tissues such as myocardium and vascular smooth muscle in which
polycystin is normally expressed. These findings suggested that vascular
abnormalities such as aneurysm may be secondary phenomena, and indeed
these have been commonly attributed to the occurrence of hypertension.
However, Kim et al. (2000) demonstrated a primary role of PKD1 mutations
in vascular fragility. They found that mouse embryos homozygous for a
mutant allele, generated by knockout, exhibited subcutaneous edema,
vascular leaks, and rupture of blood vessels, culminating in lethality
at embryonic day 15.5. Kidney and pancreatic ductal cysts were present.
They detected mouse polycystin-1 in normal endothelium and the
surrounding vascular smooth muscle cells. These data revealed a
requisite role for polycystin-1 in maintaining the structural integrity
of the vasculature as well as epithelium and suggested that the nature
of the PKD1 mutation contributes to the phenotypic variance in ADPKD.

Pritchard et al. (2000) generated transgenic mice with approximately 30
copies of a 108-kb human genomic fragment containing the entire
autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease gene, PKD1. Two such cell
lines produced full-length PKD1 mRNA and polycystin-1 protein that was
developmentally regulated, similar to the endogenous pattern, with
expression during renal embryogenesis and neonatal life that was
markedly reduced at the conclusion of renal development. Transgenic
animals from both lines often displayed multiple renal microcysts,
mainly of glomerular origin. Hepatic cysts and bile duct proliferation,
characteristic of ADPKD, were also seen. To test the functionality of
the transgene, animals were bred with the Pkd1del34 knockout mouse (Lu
et al., 1997). Both transgenic lines rescued the embryonically lethal
Pkd1del34/del34 phenotype, demonstrating that human polycystin-1 can
compensate for loss of the endogenous protein. The rescued animals were
viable into adulthood, although more than half developed hepatic cystic
disease in later life, similar to the phenotype of older Pkd1del34/+
animals. The authors hypothesized that overexpression of normal PKD1 can
elicit a disease phenotype, suggesting that the level of polycystin-1
expression may be relevant in the human disease.

Kleymenova et al. (2001) found that rats with a germline inactivation of
1 allele of the Tsc2 tumor suppressor gene developed early-onset severe
bilateral polycystic kidney disease, with similarities to the human
contiguous gene syndrome caused by germline codeletion of the PKD1 and
TSC2 genes. Polycystic rat renal cells retained 2 normal Pkd1 alleles
but were null for Tsc2 and exhibited loss of lateral membrane-localized
polycystin-1. In tuberin-deficient cells, intracellular trafficking of
polycystin-1 was disrupted, resulting in sequestration of polycystin-1
within the Golgi, and reexpression of Tsc2 restored correct polycystin-1
membrane localization. These data identified tuberin as a determinant of
polycystin-1 functional localization and, potentially, autosomal
dominant polycystic kidney disease severity.

Boulter et al. (2001) described mice carrying a targeted mutation in the
Pkd1 gene, which defined its expression pattern by using a lacZ reporter
gene. Although heterozygous adult mice developed renal and hepatic
cysts, homozygous embryos died at embryonic days 13.5 to 14.5 from a
primary cardiovascular defect that included double outflow right
ventricle, disorganized myocardium, and abnormal atrioventricular
septation. Skeletal development was also severely compromised. These
abnormalities correlated with the major sites of Pkd1 expression. During
nephrogenesis, Pkd1 was expressed in maturing tubular epithelial cells
from embryonic day 15.5. This expression coincided with the onset of
cyst formation in transgenic mice for mutations either in Pkd1 or Pkd2,
supporting the hypothesis that polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 interact in
vivo and that their failure to do so leads to abnormalities in tubule
morphology and function.

Lu et al. (2001) reported the generation of a targeted mouse mutant with
a null mutation in Pkd1 and its phenotypic characterization in
comparison with the del34 mutants that carry a truncation mutation in
Pkd1. Null homozygotes develop more aggressive renal and pancreatic
cystic disease than del34/del34. Moreover, both homozygous mutants
developed polyhydramnios, hydrops fetalis, spina bifida occulta, and
osteochondrodysplasia. Heterozygotes also develop adult-onset pancreatic
disease. The del34 homozygotes continue to produce mutant polycystin-1,
thereby providing a possible explanation for increased immunoreactive
polycystin-1 in ADPKD cyst epithelia in the context of the 2-hit model.
The authors concluded that loss of polycystin-1 leads to cyst formation
and defective skeletogenesis, and polycystin-1 may be critical in both
epithelium and chondrocyte development.

To study molecular defects in Pkd1 mutants, Muto et al. (2002) generated
a mouse with a targeted deletion of exons 2 to 6 of Pkd1. Homozygous
embryos (Pkd1 -/-) developed hydrops, cardiac conotruncal defects, and
renal cystogenesis. Total protein levels of beta-catenin in heart and
kidney and c-myc (190080) in heart were decreased in Pkd1 -/- embryos.
In the kidneys of Pkd1 -/-, the expression of E-cadherin and Pecam1
(173445) in basolateral membranes of renal tubules was attenuated, and
tyrosine phosphorylation of Egfr (131550) and Gab1 (604439) were
constitutively enhanced when cystogenesis started on embryonic day 15.5
to 16.5. Maternally administered pioglitazone, a thiazolidinedione
compound, resolved these molecular defects of Pkd1 -/-. Treatment with
pioglitazone improved survival of Pkd1 -/- embryos and ameliorated the
cardiac defects and the degree of renal cystogenesis. Long-term
treatment with pioglitazone improved the endothelial function of adult
Pkd1 +/-. The authors concluded that molecular defects observed in Pkd1
-/- embryos contributed to the pathogenesis of ADPKD, and that
thiazolidinediones had a compensatory effect on the pathway affected by
the loss of polycystin-1.

Wu et al. (2002) investigated the role of trans-heterozygous mutations
in mouse models of polycystic kidney disease. In Pkd1 +/-, Pkd2 +/-, and
Pkd1 +/-: Pkd2 +/- mice, the renal cystic lesion was mild and variable
with no adverse effect on survival at 1 year. In keeping with the 2-hit
mechanism of cyst formation, approximately 70% of kidney cysts in Pkd2
+/- mice exhibited uniform loss of polycystin-2 expression. Cystic
disease in trans-heterozygous Pkd1 +/-: Pkd2 +/- mice, however, was
notable for severity in excess of that predicted by a simple additive
effect based on cyst formation in singly heterozygous mice. These data
suggested a modifier role for the 'trans' polycystin gene in cystic
kidney disease, and suggested a contribution from threshold effects to
cyst formation and growth.

Lantinga-van Leeuwen et al. (2004) generated mice carrying a hypomorphic
Pkd1 allele (Pkd1nl), which yielded only 13 to 20% normally spliced Pkd1
transcripts in homozygous mice. Homozygous Pkd1nl mice were viable,
showing bilaterally enlarged polycystic kidneys. In addition, homozygous
Pkd1nl mice showed dilatations of pancreatic and liver bile ducts as
well as cardiovascular abnormalities, pathogenic features similar to the
human ADPKD phenotype. The authors concluded that a reduced dosage of
Pkd1 is sufficient to initiate cystogenesis and vascular defects, and
that low Pkd1 gene expression levels can overcome the embryonic
lethality seen in Pkd1-knockout mice. Lantinga-van Leeuwen et al. (2004)
hypothesized that in patients, reduced PKD1 expression of the normal
allele below a critical level, due to genetic, environmental, or
stochastic factors, may lead to cyst formation in the kidneys and other
clinical features of ADPKD.

The homolog of the human PKD1 gene maps to feline chromosome E3. Young
et al. (2005) demonstrated that the feline polycystic kidney disease
maps to this region.

Piontek et al. (2007) found that inactivation of the Pkd1 gene in mice
before postnatal day 13 resulted in severely cystic kidneys within 3
weeks, whereas inactivation at day 14 or later resulted in cysts only
after 5 months. In both cases, the cysts originated from all tubular
segments. The abrupt change in response to Pkd1 inactivation
corresponded to a brake point in renal growth and significant changes in
gene expression. Piontek et al. (2007) concluded that the pathologic
consequences of PKD1 inactivation are defined by a developmental switch
that signals terminal renal maturation.

Patients with tuberous sclerosis often develop renal cysts and those
with inherited codeletions of PKD1 gene develop severe, early-onset
polycystic kidneys. Using mouse models, Bonnet et al. (2009) showed that
many of the earliest lesions from Tsc1 (605284) +/-, Tsc2 +/-, and Pkd1
+/- mice did not exhibit activation of mTOR, confirming an
mTOR-independent pathway of renal cystogenesis. Using Tsc1/Pkd1 and
Tsc2/Pkd1 heterozygous double-mutants, the authors showed functional
cooperation and an effect on renal primary cilium length between
hamartin and tuberin with polycystin-1. The Tsc1, Tsc2, and Pkd1 gene
products helped regulate primary cilia length in renal tubules, renal
epithelial cells, and precystic hepatic cholangiocytes. Consistent with
the function of cilia in modulating cell polarity, Bonnet et al. (2009)
found that many dividing precystic renal tubule and hepatic bile duct
cells from Tsc1, Tsc2, and Pkd1 heterozygous mice were highly
misoriented. Bonnet et al. (2009) proposed that defects in cell polarity
may underlie cystic disease associated with TSC1, TSC2, and PKD1, and
that targeting of this pathway may be of key therapeutic benefit.

Takakura et al. (2009) showed that renal injury led to massive cystic
disease in a mouse model of adult inactivation of Pkd1 using the
Mx1Cre(+) allele. Cysts were labeled with a collecting duct/tubule
marker Dolichos biflorus agglutinin, which correlated with the site of
Cre-mediated recombination in the collecting system. BrdU labeling
revealed that cyst-lining epithelial cells were comprised of regenerated
cells in response to renal injury. Takakura et al. (2009) proposed a
role for polycystin-1 in kidney injury and repair and suggested that
renal injury may constitute a 'third hit' resulting in rapid cyst
formation in adulthood.

Kurbegovic et al. (2010) generated 3 transgenic mouse lines from a
Pkd1-BAC modified by introducing a silent tag via homologous
recombination to target a sustained wildtype genomic Pkd1 expression
within the native tissue and temporal regulation. The mice specifically
overexpressed the Pkd1 transgene in extrarenal and renal tissues from 2-
to 15-fold over Pkd1 endogenous levels in a copy-dependent manner. All
transgenic mice reproducibly developed tubular and glomerular cysts
leading to renal insufficiency. Pkd1(TAG) mice also exhibited renal
fibrosis and calcium deposits in papilla reminiscent of nephrolithiasis,
as is frequently observed in ADPKD. Similar to human ADPKD, these mice
consistently displayed hepatic fibrosis and approximately 15%
intrahepatic cysts of the bile ducts, affecting females preferentially.
A significant proportion of mice developed cardiac anomalies with severe
left ventricular hypertrophy, marked aortic arch distention, and/or
valvular stenosis and calcification that had profound functional impact.
Pkd1(TAG) mice displayed occasional cerebral lesions with evidence of
ruptured and unruptured cerebral aneurysms.

Using a combination of targeted knockout and overexpression with 2 genes
mutated in polycystic liver disease (PCLD; 174050), Prkcsh (177060) and
Sec63 (608648), and 3 genes mutated in polycystic kidney disease, Pkd1,
Pkd2, and Pkhd1, Fedeles et al. (2011) produced a spectrum of cystic
disease severity in mice. Cyst formation in all combinations of these
genes, except complete loss of Pkd2, was significantly modulated by
altering expression of Pkd1. Proteasome inhibition increased the
steady-state levels of Pkd1 in cells lacking Prkcsh and reduced cystic
disease in mouse models of autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease.
Fedeles et al. (2011) concluded that PRKCSH, SEC63, PKD1, PKD2, and
PKHD1 form an interaction network with PKD1 as the rate-limiting
component.

HISTORY

Chanmugam et al. (1971) reported a family that might suggest linkage of
hereditary spherocytosis (see 182900) and polycystic kidney disease. A
father and 3 children had both diseases. Three other children and 4 sibs
of the father were thought to be free of both diseases. There is,
however, no other suggestion of location of a spherocytosis locus on
chromosome 16, or chromosome 4 (cf. 173910), where genes for adult
polycystic kidney disease have been mapped.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE 1
PKD1, IVSDS, G-C, +1

In probands with polycystic kidney disease-1 (PKD1; 173900), the
European Polycystic Kidney Disease Consortium (1994) found 4 mutations
in the PKD1 gene, including a G-to-C transition at position +1 of the
splice donor site following the 135-bp exon and resulting in an in-frame
deletion of basepairs 3696-3831. The proband was from a large family in
which the disease could be traced through 3 generations. In a parent and
2 affected sibs, the abnormal transcript segregated with PKD1.

.0002
POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE 1
PKD1, GLN1273TER

Turco et al. (1995) used PCR with primer pairs located in the 3-prime
unique region of the PKD1 gene and heteroduplex DNA analysis in 20
unrelated ADPKD probands from northern Italy, all of whom were members
of families in which previous studies had indicated linkage to PKD1
(173900). In 5 affected individuals from the same family, they found
novel aberrant bands that were absent in 13 unaffected family members.
Cloning and automated DNA sequencing revealed a C-to-T transition at
nucleotide 3817 of the published cDNA sequence, which created a
premature stop codon. The mutation changed a CAG codon for glutamine to
a TAG amber stop codon (Q1273X). The mutation destroyed an MspA1I
restriction site, and the abnormal restriction pattern was observed on
genomic DNA from all the affected family members. RT-PCR and restriction
analysis performed on peripheral white blood cell mRNA showed that in
the affected members both the mutant and the normal transcript were
represented. The mutation was not found in the probands of the other
families studied. This appears to have been the first nonsense mutation
described in the PKD1 gene.

.0003
POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE 1
PKD1, 15-BP DEL

Among the 6 novel mutations in families with PKD1 (173900) that Peral et
al. (1996) added to the 7 previously described ones was an in-frame
15-bp deletion which removed 5 amino acids, RQVRL, between amino acids
3747 and 3753. The deletion was probably promoted by misalignment of 2
directly repeated 7-bp sequences. The repeated sequences meant that the
precise region deleted could not be determined.

.0004
POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE 1
PKD1, ARG4227TER

Peral et al. (1996) found an abnormal fragment by SSCP analysis of the
PKD1 gene in a patient with polycystic kidney disease (173900). Direct
sequencing revealed a C-to-T transition changing the arg4227 codon, CGA,
to a stop codon, TGA, and giving rise to a predicted truncated protein
76 amino acids shorter than the normal protein. The same abnormality was
found in 2 affected relatives.

.0005
POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE 1
PKD1, GLN3837TER

Peral et al. (1996) used SSCP analysis followed by direct sequencing in
a patient with polycystic kidney disease (173900) revealed a
gln3837-to-ter (CAG-to-TAG, Q3837X) mutation in the PKD1 gene. The
mutation abolished a PvuII restriction site and this was used to confirm
the mutation in 2 other affected relatives.

.0006
POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE 1
PKD1, CYS4086TER

In a large Cypriot family with PKD1 (173900), Neophytou et al. (1996)
identified a T-to-A nucleotide substitution at position 12258 in the
3-prime region of polycystin that led to a cys4086-to-ter mutation
(C4086X). The premature stop codon is expected to remove 217 amino acids
from the C-terminal intracellular domain of the gene product.

.0007
POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE 1
PKD1, TYR3818TER

Peral et al. (1996) described a tyr3818-to-ter (Y3818X) mutation in the
PKD1 gene in a severely affected child with polycystic kidney disease
(173900). They found the same mutation in her clinically normal twin
brother and in her father who had typical adult-onset disease. Because
the same stable mutation was associated with very different disease
severity in this family, Peral et al. (1996) proposed that a small
number of modifying factors may radically affect the course of type 1
polycystic kidney disease.

.0008
POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE 1
PKD1, 12036G-A

In individuals of Dutch origin with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney
disease (173900), Roelfsema et al. (1997) used the protein truncation
test (PTT) to detect mutations in the PKD1 gene. Since the PTT detects
only translation-terminating mutations, all mutations that they found
were either base substitutions leading to a stop codon or frameshifts.
In 4 cases there were small deletions leading to frameshifts; base
substitutions were found in 3 individuals. One of these was a G-to-A
transition of nucleotide 12036 in exon 44. The transition created a new
Sau3AI restriction site and eliminated an AvaII site.

.0009
POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE 1
PKD1, 28-BP DEL, NT6434

Using long-range PCR and direct sequence analysis in a group of 24
unrelated patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease
(173900), Thomas et al. (1999) identified 7 novel mutations in the PKD1
gene, one of which was a 28-bp deletion involving nucleotides 6434-6461
in exon 15.

.0010
POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE 1
PKD1, IVS14, G-A, -1

One of 7 unique mutations identified by Thomas et al. (1999) in patients
with PKD1 (173900) was a splice mutation, a G-to-A transition at
position -1 in the acceptor site in intron 14.

.0011
POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE 1
PKD1, ARG324LEU

One of 7 unique mutations identified by Thomas et al. (1999) by
long-range PCR and direct sequencing of the PKD1 gene in patients with
polycystic kidney disease (173900) was an arg324-to-leu (R324L) mutation
in exon 5.

.0012
POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE 1
PKD1, LEU845SER

One of 7 unique mutations identified by Thomas et al. (1999) by
long-range PCR and direct sequencing of the PKD1 gene in patients with
polycystic kidney disease (173900) was a leu845-to-ser (L845S) mutation
in exon 11.

.0013
POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE 1
PKD1, GLN1922TER

One of 7 unique mutations identified by Thomas et al. (1999) by
long-range PCR and direct sequencing of the PKD1 gene in patients with
polycystic kidney disease (173900) was a nonsense mutation, gln1922 to
ter (Q1922X), in exon 15.

.0014
POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE 1, SEVERE
PKD1, 2-BP DEL, 5224AG

In 3 of 35 independently ascertained pedigrees with polycystic kidney
disease (173900) selected for study because they included individuals
with either intracranial aneurysms and/or very early-onset disease,
Watnick et al. (1999) identified an identical 2-bp deletion (AG) at
nucleotide 5224 in exon 15 of the PKD1 gene. One family contained an
individual with a cerebral aneurysm. A second family was evaluated
because a child had very early-onset disease; the affected father had
the same mutation as the daughter. The third family had at least 3
individuals with aneurysms, including 1 with very early onset. There
were 2 additional individuals in this family (both cousins of the
individual with both early onset-disease and aneurysm) who had very
early-onset disease but from whom DNA samples were not available.
Although each of these 3 families had individuals who were severely
affected, there were also individuals with renal cystic disease and a
more routine presentation.

.0015
POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE 1, SEVERE
PKD1, TRP4139TER

In a 25-year-old French patient with APKD (173900), Perrichot et al.
(1999) identified what they claimed to be the fourth reported de novo
mutation in the PKD1 gene: a 12628G-A transition in exon 45 leading to a
trp4139-to-ter (W4139X) mutation.

.0016
POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE 1
PKD1, GLY2579DEL, 8-BP DEL

In a family with ADPKD (173900), Bouba et al. (2001) identified 2
deletions in the PKD1 gene: a 3-bp deletion in exon 20 and an 8-bp
deletion in exon 21. The deletions were coinherited on the same
chromosome, causing disease in the mother and 3 sons. The 3-bp mutation
corresponded to glycine at codon 2579. The 8-bp deletion was predicted
to result in a translation frameshift after amino acid 2657, leading to
a stop codon 483 bp downstream. Cloning and sequencing experiments
showed that the 2 deletions were in cis position on the chromosome that
was inherited from the affected mother.

609316	TITLE *609316 TRIPARTITE MOTIF-CONTAINING PROTEIN 31; TRIM31
;;HCGI
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening a duodenal mucosa cDNA library with a fragment of a YAC
containing the HLA-A gene (142800), El Kahloun et al. (1992) cloned
TRIM31, which they designated HCGI. Northern blot analysis of several
tissues detected a 1.2-kb TRIM31 transcript in duodenal mucosa only.

Using a B-box domain consensus sequence to screen EST databases for
novel TRIM family members, Reymond et al. (2001) identified and cloned
mouse and human TRIM31. The deduced protein contains an N-terminal RING
domain, a B-box-2 domain, and a coiled-coil region.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Reymond et al. (2001) found that TRIM31
forms homodimers. Mutation analysis of other TRIM proteins suggested
that the coiled-coil region mediates complex formation.

MAPPING

By YAC analysis, El Kahloun et al. (1992) mapped the TRIM31 gene to
chromosome 6p3-p21. TRIM31 is a single-copy gene about 170 kb
centromeric to HLA-A.

By radiation hybrid analysis, Reymond et al. (2001) mapped the TRIM31
gene to chromosome 6p23-p21, where it resides within a TRIM gene cluster
that includes TRIM10 (605701), TRIM26 (600830), and TRIM27 (RFP;
602165).

609268	TITLE *609268 SPLICING REGULATORY PROTEIN, GLUTAMINE/LYSINE-RICH, 1; SREK1
;;SPLICING FACTOR, ARGININE/SERINE-RICH, 12; SFRS12;;
SR-RELATED PROTEIN, 86-KD; SRRp86;;
SRRp508
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SFRS12 belongs to the superfamily of serine/arginine-rich (SR) splicing
factors. It modulates splice site selection by regulating the activities
of other SR proteins (Barnard et al., 2002).

CLONING

Barnard and Patton (2000) cloned rat Sfrs12, which they called Srrp86.
The deduced 495-amino acid protein contains an RNA recognition motif
(RRM) near its N terminus and 2 SR domains separated by a unique EK
(glutamic acid and lysine)-rich region.

By PCR of a human pancreas cDNA library, Zhang et al. (2002) cloned
SFRS12, which they called SRRp508. The deduced 508-amino acid protein
contains an N-terminal RRM and 2 C-terminal regions rich in SR
dipeptides. The rat and human SFRS12 proteins share 86% identity. Zhang
et al. (2002) determined that SFRS12 has an extensive expression
profile.

GENE FUNCTION

Barnard and Patton (2000) found that immunodepletion of SRRp86 did not
affect the ability of HeLa cell nuclear extracts to splice an RNA test
substrate. However, SRRp86 could modulate the ability of purified
mammalian SR proteins to activate splicing in vitro and in vivo.
Mammalian SRp20 (SFRS3; 603364) was activated by SRRp86, whereas ASF
(SFRS1; 600812), SC35 (SFRS2; 600813), and SRp55 (SFRS6; 601944) were
inhibited. Full-length mammalian SRRp86, but not a mutant lacking the 2
RS domains and the intervening EK-rich region, preferentially interacted
with itself, SRp20, ASF, SRp55, and, to a lesser extent, SC35. Barnard
and Patton (2000) concluded that the pairwise combination of SRRp86 and
specific SR proteins leads to altered splicing efficiency and
differential splice site selection.

By Western blot analysis of several rat tissues, Barnard et al. (2002)
found that the ratio of Srrp86, Srp20, and Sc35 was tissue specific.
They hypothesized that the altered ratio of SR proteins could allow for
fine-tuned control of tissue-specific alternative splicing by varying
the levels of activators and repressors of splice site selection.

Li et al. (2002) generated a series of chimeric proteins by swapping the
RRM and SR domains between mammalian SRRp86, ASF, and SRp75 (SFRS4;
601940). Although domain swaps between SRRp86 and ASF showed that the
RRMs primarily determined splicing activity, swaps between SRRp86 and
SRp75 demonstrated that the SR domains could also determine activity.
The EK domain of SRRp86 repressed splicing and splice site selection
both in vitro and in vivo. Li et al. (2002) concluded that the EK domain
of SRRp86 plays a modulatory role in controlling SR domain function.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhang et al. (2002) determined that the SFRS12 gene contains 12 exons.
The promoter region contains a TATA box.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Zhang et al. (2002) mapped the SFRS12 gene
to chromosome 5q11.2-q12.1.

603764	TITLE *603764 CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE 5, REGULATORY SUBUNIT 2; CDK5R2
;;NEURONAL CDK5 ACTIVATOR ISOFORM; NCK5AI;;
CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE 5, REGULATORY PARTNER, 39-KD; p39;;
p39(NCK5AI)
DESCRIPTION Neuronal CDC2 (116940)-like kinase is a heterodimer of CDK5 (123831) and
p25(nck5a), a neuron-specific 25-kD regulatory subunit derived
proteolytically from NCK5A (neuronal CDK5 activator; 603460). By
screening a human hippocampus library with a bovine Nck5a cDNA, Tang et
al. (1995) isolated cDNAs encoding NCK5AI, a distinct NCK5A isoform.
They also referred to the protein as p39(nck5ai) based on its calculated
molecular mass of 39 kD. The predicted 367-amino acid p39(nck5ai)
protein shares 57% sequence identity with human NCK5A. As does
p25(nck5a), a 30-kD truncated form of p39(nck5ai) activated both
recombinant and native CDK5 in vitro. Northern blot analysis of rat
tissues indicated that both Nck5A and p39(nck5ai) are expressed
exclusively in brain. In situ hybridization to rat brain sections
revealed that p39(nck5ai) mRNA was highly expressed in the CA1 to CA3
zone of hippocampal formation, an area highly enriched in neurons. There
was no expression in the fimbria hippocampi, where glial cells
predominate. Tang et al. (1995) concluded that p39(nck5ai) shares many
common characteristics with NCK5A, including CDK5-activating activity
and brain- and neuron-specific expression.

Nilden et al. (1998) identified Cdk5r2, the mouse gene homologous to
human p39(nck5ai). The coding region of Cdk5r2 is contained within a
single exon. The predicted mouse and human proteins are 95% identical.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Muravenko et al. (2000) mapped

604450	TITLE *604450 PROTEASOME 26S SUBUNIT, NON-ATPase, 12; PSMD12
;;p55
DESCRIPTION The 26S proteasome is responsible for the ATP-dependent degradation of a
variety of cellular proteins. Selective breakdown of these proteins is
mediated by the ubiquitin pathway. The 26S proteasome is a 2,000-kD
protein complex composed of the 20S proteasome, which is the catalytic
subcomplex, and PA700, which is the regulatory subcomplex. The
approximately 700-kD PA700 complex consists of approximately 20
heterogeneous proteins ranging from 25 to 112 kD. These subunits can be
divided into 2 classes, those that are members of the AAA (ATPases
associated with various cellular activities) family and those that are
not.

Saito et al. (1997) sequenced peptides from the p55 subunit of the
bovine PA700 complex. They identified a human EST encoding a homologous
protein and used this EST to isolate hepatoblastoma HepG2 cell cDNAs
encoding human p55, also called PSMD12. The deduced 456-amino acid
PSMD12 protein has a calculated molecular mass of 52,903 Da. The authors
identified a putative S. cerevisiae homolog, which they named NAS5, that
shares 41.1% amino acid sequence identity with PSMD12. Disruption of the
NAS5 gene resulted in lethality.

602423	TITLE *602423 NUCLEAR RECEPTOR SUBFAMILY 1, GROUP H, MEMBER 3; NR1H3
;;LIVER X RECEPTOR, ALPHA;;
LX RECEPTOR, ALPHA; LXRA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The liver X receptors, LXRA and LXRB (NR1H2; 600380), form a subfamily
of the nuclear receptor superfamily and are key regulators of macrophage
function, controlling transcriptional programs involved in lipid
homeostasis and inflammation. The inducible LXRA is highly expressed in
liver, adrenal gland, intestine, adipose tissue, macrophages, lung, and
kidney, whereas LXRB is ubiquitously expressed. Ligand-activated LXRs
form obligate heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (RXRs; see 180245)
and regulate expression of target genes containing LXR response elements
(summary by Korf et al., 2009).

CLONING

Retinoic acid mediates tissue-specific expression of target genes
through its binding to nuclear hormone receptors (e.g., RARA; 180240).
To activate transcription, these receptors bind specific sites, called
hormone response elements, within the target gene's regulatory region.
By screening a human liver cDNA library with an RARA cDNA probe, Willy
et al. (1995) identified a cDNA encoding NR1H3, or LXRA, an orphan
member of the nuclear receptor superfamily. The predicted 447-amino acid
LXRA protein contains a DNA-binding domain and a putative ligand-binding
domain; the amino acid sequences of these domains are 77% identical to
those of NR1H2. Northern blot analysis showed strong expression of a
1.9-kb LXRA transcript in metabolic organs such as liver, kidney, and
intestine. In mouse, Northern blot analysis detected a low level of Lxra
expression at embryonic day 13.5 that continued to increase through
parturition.

GENE FUNCTION

Willy et al. (1995) identified a distinct retinoid response element for
LXRA/RXRA (180245) heterodimers, termed the LXR-responsive element
(LXRE), that consists of 2 degenerate copies of the consensus hexad
sequence spaced by 4 nucleotides. LXRA specifically interacted with RXRA
in vivo to form a functional heterodimer in which RXRA was the
ligand-binding subunit. Willy et al. (1995) found that LXRA-mediated
gene activation was only induced by certain retinoids, including 9-cis
retinoic acid (9cRA). They concluded that LXRA is a tissue-specific
cofactor that permits RXRA to function as a potent 9cRA receptor with a
distinct target gene specificity. Willy et al. (1995) stated that LXRA
defines a novel retinoid response system.

In an elegant series of experiments designed to understand the effect of
RXR activation on cholesterol balance, Repa et al. (2000) treated
animals with the rexinoid LG268. Animals treated with rexinoid exhibited
marked changes in cholesterol balance, including inhibition of
cholesterol absorption and repressed bile acid synthesis. Studies with
receptor-selective agonists revealed that oxysterol receptors (LXRs) and
the bile acid receptor, FXR (603826), are the RXR heterodimeric partners
that mediate these effects by regulating expression of the
reverse-cholesterol transporter, ABC1 (ABCA1; 600046), and the
rate-limiting enzyme of bile acid synthesis, CYP7A1, respectively. These
RXR heterodimers serve as key regulators in cholesterol homeostasis by
governing reverse cholesterol transport from peripheral tissues, bile
acid synthesis in liver, and cholesterol absorption in intestine.
Activation of RXR/LXR heterodimers inhibits cholesterol absorption by
upregulation of ABC1 expression in the small intestine. Activation of
RXR/FXR heterodimers represses CYP7A1 expression and bile acid
production, leading to a failure to solubilize and absorb cholesterol.
Studies have shown that RXR/FXR-mediated repression of CYP7A1 is
dominant over RXR/LXR-mediated induction of CYP7A1, which explains why
the rexinoid represses rather than activates CYP7A1 (Lu et al., 2000).
Activation of the LXR signaling pathway results in the upregulation of
ABC1 in peripheral cells, including macrophages, to efflux free
cholesterol for transport back to the liver through high density
lipoprotein, where it is converted to bile acids by the LXR-mediated
increase in CYP7A1 expression. Secretion of biliary cholesterol in the
presence of increased bile acid pools normally results in enhanced
reabsorption of cholesterol; however, with the increased expression of
ABC1 and efflux of cholesterol back into the lumen, there is a reduction
in cholesterol absorption and net excretion of cholesterol and bile
acid. Rexinoids therefore offer a novel class of agents for treating
elevated cholesterol.

LXR activity is critical for physiologic lipid metabolism and transport.
Tangirala et al. (2002) linked LXR signaling pathways to the
pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. Bone marrow transplantations
were used to selectively eliminate macrophage LXR expression in the
context of murine models of atherosclerosis. The results demonstrated
that LXRs are endogenous inhibitors of atherogenesis. Additionally,
elimination of LXR activity in bone marrow-derived cells mimicked many
aspects of Tangier disease (205400), a human high density lipoprotein
deficiency, including aberrant regulation of cholesterol transporter
expression, lipid accumulation in macrophages, splenomegaly, and
increased atherosclerosis. These results identified LXRs as targets for
therapeutic intervention in cardiovascular disease.

Macrophages have important roles in both lipid metabolism and
inflammation and are central to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. The
liver X receptors (LXRs) are established mediators of lipid-inducible
gene expression. In studies in cultured cells and in mice, Joseph et al.
(2003) demonstrated that LXRs and their ligands are negative regulators
of macrophage inflammatory gene expression. Transcriptional profiling of
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced macrophages revealed reciprocal
LXR-dependent regulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism and the
innate immune response. In vitro, LXR ligands inhibited the expression
of inflammatory mediators such as inducible nitric oxide synthase
(163730), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 (600262), and interleukin-6 (IL6;
147620) in response to bacterial infection or LPS stimulation. In vivo,
LXR agonists reduced inflammation in a model of contact dermatitis and
inhibited inflammatory gene expression in the aortas of atherosclerotic
mice. These findings indicated that LXRs are lipid-dependent regulators
of inflammatory gene expression that may serve to link lipid metabolism
and immune functions in macrophages.

Mitro et al. (2007) showed that glucose binds and stimulates the
transcriptional activity of LXR, a nuclear receptor that coordinates
hepatic lipid metabolism. D-glucose and D-glucose-6-phosphate are direct
agonists of both LXR-alpha and LXR-beta. Glucose activated LXR at
physiologic concentrations expected in the liver and induced expression
of LXR target genes with efficacy similar to that of oxysterols, the
known LXR ligands. Cholesterol homeostasis genes that require LXR for
expression were upregulated in liver and intestine of fasted mice refed
with a glucose diet, indicating that glucose is an endogenous LXR
ligand. Mitro et al. (2007) concluded that their results identified LXR
as a transcriptional switch that integrates hepatic glucose metabolism
and fatty acid synthesis.

Zelcer et al. (2009) demonstrated that the sterol-responsive nuclear
liver X receptor (LXR) helps maintain cholesterol homeostasis, not only
through promotion of cholesterol efflux but also through suppression of
LDL uptake. LXR inhibits the LDL receptor (LDLR; 606945) pathway through
the transcriptional induction of IDOL (MYLIP; 610082), an E3 ubiquitin
ligase that triggers ubiquitination of the LDLR on its cytoplasmic
domain, thereby targeting it for degradation. LXR ligand reduced,
whereas LXR knockout increased, LDLR protein levels in vivo in a
tissue-selective manner. IDOL knockdown in hepatocytes increased LDLR
protein levels and promoted LDL uptake. Conversely, Zelcer et al. (2009)
found that adenovirus-mediated expression of IDOL in mouse liver
promoted LDLR degradation and elevated plasma LDL levels. Zelcer et al.
(2009) concluded that the LXR-IDOL-LDLR axis defines a complementary
pathway to sterol response element-binding proteins for sterol
regulation of cholesterol uptake.

ANIMAL MODEL

Peet et al. (1998) demonstrated that mice lacking the oxysterol receptor
LXRA lost their ability to respond normally to dietary cholesterol and
were unable to tolerate any amount of cholesterol in excess of that
which they synthesized de novo. When fed diets containing cholesterol,
Lxra -/- mice failed to induce transcription of the gene encoding
cholesterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1; 118455), the rate-limiting
enzyme in bile acid synthesis. This defect was associated with a rapid
accumulation of large amounts of cholesterol in the liver that
eventually led to impaired hepatic function. The regulation of several
other crucial lipid metabolizing genes was also altered in Lxra -/-
mice. The results of Peet et al. (1998) demonstrated the existence of a
physiologically significant feed-forward regulatory pathway for sterol
metabolism and established the role of LXRA as the major sensor of
dietary cholesterol.

Repa et al. (2002) presented evidence for the direct control of the
ATP-binding cassette sterol transporters Abca1 (600046), Abcg5 (605459),
and Abcg8 (605460) by the liver X receptors. The intensity of hepatic
and jejunal staining for Abcg5/g8 and Abca1 was increased in normal mice
fed cholesterol or other Lxr agonists. Cholesterol feeding resulted in
upregulation of Abcg5 and Abcg8 in the Lxrb-null mice, but not in the
Lxra-null or double knockout mice, suggesting that Lxra is required for
sterol upregulation of Abcg5/g8 in this model. In a rat hepatoma cell
line, Lxr-dependent transcription of the Abcg5/g8 genes was
cycloheximide-resistant, indicating that these genes are directly
regulated by the liver X receptors.

Joseph et al. (2002) demonstrated that the nonsteroidal Lxr agonist
GW3965 has potent antiatherogenic activity in 2 different murine models:
Ldlr -/- mice (606945) and ApoE -/- mice (107741).

Joseph et al. (2003) demonstrated that LXR agonists reduced inflammation
in a model of contact dermatitis and inhibited inflammatory gene
expression in the aortas of atherosclerotic mice; these and other
findings suggested that LXRs are lipid-dependent regulators of
inflammatory gene expression that may serve to link lipid metabolism and
immune functions in macrophages.

In Abcg5/Abcg8-deficient mice, Yang et al. (2004) demonstrated that
accumulation of plant sterols perturbed cholesterol homeostasis in the
adrenal gland, with a 91% reduction in its cholesterol content. Despite
very low cholesterol levels, there was no compensatory increase in
cholesterol synthesis or in lipoprotein receptor expression. Adrenal
cholesterol levels returned to near-normal levels in mice treated with
ezetimibe, which blocks phytosterol absorption. In cultured adrenal
cells, stigmasterol but not sitosterol inhibited SREBP2 (600481)
processing and reduced cholesterol synthesis; stigmasterol also
activated the liver X receptor in a cell-based reporter assay. Yang et
al. (2004) concluded that selected dietary plant sterols disrupt
cholesterol homeostasis by affecting 2 critical regulatory pathways of
lipid metabolism.

Macrophages play a direct role, through both innate and adaptive
immunity, in microbial killing, and they orchestrate inflammatory
responses through the release of immune modulators, such as chemokines
and cytokines. Joseph et al. (2004) found that mice lacking both Lxra
and Lxrb (Lxr-null) were highly susceptible to infection with Listeria
monocytogenes (LM) in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, they
determined that Lxra-deficient mice were more susceptible than
Lxrb-deficient mice. Compared with wildtype mice, bacterial burdens were
2 logs higher in Lxr-null and Lxra -/- mice, and neutrophilic abscesses
in liver were increased in Lxr-null mice. Analysis of plasma cytokine
and chemokine mediators indicated no significant change in inflammatory
mediators, except for Il6 and Il12p70 (see 161560). Microarray analysis
and real-time RT-PCR revealed that the most striking difference in
response to LM infection in the mutant mice was reduced expression of
the antiapoptotic factor Sp-alpha (CD5L; 602592) and, to a lesser
extent, Marco (604870), both of which are members of the scavenger
receptor cysteine-rich repeat family. Sp-alpha expression was severely
compromised in response to LXR ligands in Lxra -/- macrophages, but not
in Lxrb -/- macrophages, and the Sp-alpha promoter was preferentially
activated by Lxra. In contrast, expression of Cd14 (158120) and Cd68
(153634) increased in Lxr-null mice after LM infection. Infection of
macrophages with LM or Shigella, but not with extracellular bacteria,
strongly induced Lxra expression, but not Lxrb expression, via the NOD
(see CARD4; 605980) signaling pathway. Flow cytometric and TUNEL
analyses demonstrated increased apoptosis in Lxr-null macrophages
compared with wildtype macrophages. Joseph et al. (2004) concluded that
LXR activity and its regulation of Sp-alpha promotes macrophage survival
and antimicrobial function in the setting of LM and intracellular
pathogen infection.

In a mouse renin (179820)-expressing cell line, Morello et al. (2005)
demonstrated that both LXRA and LXRB could bind to the renin promoter
and regulate renin transcription; cAMP increased LXRA activity but
decreased that of LXRB. In the mouse kidney, in situ hybridization
studies showed colocalization of renin and LXRA in juxtaglomerular
cells, and in mouse models, renin-angiotensin (see 106150) activation
was associated with increased binding of LXRA to the renin promoter. In
Lxra-null mice, the elevation of renin triggered by adrenergic
stimulation was abolished; untreated Lxrb-null mice exhibited reduced
kidney renin mRNA levels compared with controls. Lxra/Lxrb-null mice
showed a combined phenotype of lower basal renin and blunted adrenergic
response. Morello et al. (2005) concluded that LXRA and LXRB regulate
renin expression in vivo by directly interacting with the renin promoter
and that the cAMP/LXRA signaling pathway is required for adrenergic
control of the renin-angiotensin system.

Cummins et al. (2006) demonstrated that under chronic dietary stress the
adrenal glands of Lxra/Lxrb double-null mice accumulated free
cholesterol, whereas wildtype mice maintained cholesterol homeostasis.
At baseline, Lxra/Lxrb double-null mice exhibited a marked decrease in
Abca1 and derepression of Star (600617) expression, causing a net
decrease in cholesterol efflux and an increase in steroidogenesis. In
Lxra/Lxrb double-null mice pretreated with dexamethasone to prevent the
acute stress response, the phenotype of hypercorticosteronemia,
cholesterol ester accumulation, and adrenomegaly was specific to loss of
Lxra and not Lxrb. Western blot analysis showed increased expression of
STAR in human and mouse adrenal cells treated with LXR and RXR agonists.
Stimulation of Star expression by Lxra activation was mediated by
binding of the Lxra/Rxra heterodimer to an LXR response element (LRE) in
the mouse Star promoter. Cummins et al. (2006) suggested that LXRA
provides a safety valve to limit free cholesterol levels as a basal
protective mechanism in the adrenal gland.

Bradley et al. (2007) generated Lxra-null/Apoe-null mice and observed
extreme cholesterol accumulation in peripheral tissues, a dramatic
increase in whole-body cholesterol burden, and accelerated
atherosclerosis, which suggested that the level of Lxr pathway
activation in macrophages achieved by Lxrb and endogenous ligand was
unable to maintain homeostasis in the setting of hypercholesterolemia.
Treatment of Lxra-null/Apoe-null mice with the highly efficacious
synthetic Lxr agonist GW3965, however, ameliorated the cholesterol
overload phenotype and reduced atherosclerosis. Bradley et al. (2007)
concluded that LXRA has an essential role in maintaining peripheral
cholesterol homeostasis in the context of hypercholesterolemia.

Using mice lacking Lxra or Lxrb, Bensinger et al. (2008) showed that
T-cell activation triggered induction of the oxysterol-metabolizing
enzyme Sult2b1 (604125), suppression of the Lxr pathway for cholesterol
transport, and promotion of the Srebp2 pathway for cholesterol
synthesis. Proliferation was inhibited by Lxr ligation during T-cell
activation by mitogen, but cells from mice lacking Lxrb had a
proliferative advantage. Lymphocytes lacking Abcg1 (603076) were not
inhibited in the presence of Lxr agonists, indicating that transport of
sterols by ABCG1 is required for LXR agonist-mediated inhibition. Mice
lacking Lxrb displayed lymphoid hyperplasia and enhanced responses to
antigenic challenge. Bensinger et al. (2008) concluded that cellular
cholesterol levels in dividing T cells are maintained, in part, through
reciprocal regulation of LXR and SREBP transcriptional programs, and
that LXR signaling is a metabolic checkpoint that modulates cell
proliferation and immunity.

Using RT-PCR analysis of Cd11c (ITGAX; 151510)-positive lung and
alveolar cells from mice infected intratracheally with Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, Korf et al. (2009) detected increased expression of Lxra
and Lxrb and their target genes, Apoe and Abca1, as well as Pparg
(601487) and Srebp1 (SREBF1; 184756). Mice deficient in Lxra or both
Lxra and Lxrb, but not mice deficient in Lxrb only, were more
susceptible to infection than wildtype mice in terms of bacterial burden
and in size and number of granulomatous lesions. Double-knockout mice
failed to mount an early neutrophilic response and showed dysregulation
in the expression of inflammatory factors by Cd11c cells. Diminished Th1
and Th17 function, but not Th2 function, was also found in lungs of
infected mice. Treatment with Lxr agonists resulted in a 10-fold
decrease in bacterial burden and increased Th1 and Th17 function. Korf
et al. (2009) concluded that the neutrophil-IL17 (603149) axis depends
on LXR signaling and is important in resistance to M. tuberculosis
infection.

602656	TITLE *602656 ENDONUCLEASE III-LIKE 1; NTHL1
;;ENDONUCLEASE III, E. COLI, HOMOLOG OF; NTH1;;
OCTS3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DNA N-glycosylases, or apurinic/apyrimidinic lyases, of the endonuclease
III family, such as NTHL1, initiate DNA base excision repair of oxidized
ring saturated pyrimidine residues (Ocampo et al., 2002).

CLONING

The European Chromosome 16 Tuberous Sclerosis Consortium (1993)
identified a gene, termed OCTS3, that lies next to TSC2 (191092) in a
head-to-head orientation on chromosome 16. Aspinwall et al. (1997)
cloned a corresponding cDNA and showed that OCTS3 encodes a human
homolog of E. coli endonuclease III. They renamed the human gene NTH1,
in reference to the E. coli 'nth' gene. The human NTH1 gene encodes a
312-amino acid polypeptide with a predicted mass of 34.3 kD. When
expressed and purified, the protein had the same enzymatic activities as
the E. coli enzyme: DNA glycosylase activity on DNA substrates
containing oxidized pyrimidine residues, and apurinic/apyrimidinic lyase
activity.

Based on peptide sequences of purified bovine endonuclease III and
sequences in the expressed sequence tag database (dbEST), Hilbert et al.
(1997) also cloned a human NTH1 cDNA.

Using Northern blot analysis, Imai et al. (1998) found ubiquitous but
variable expression of a 1.0-kb NTHL1 transcript.

GENE STRUCTURE

Imai et al. (1998) cloned the NTHL1 gene and showed that it contains 6
exons spanning approximately 8 kb of genomic DNA. Promoter analysis
indicated a lack of TATA and CAAT boxes but the presence of a CpG island
with binding sites for several transcription factors.

MAPPING

Hilbert et al. (1997) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to
localize the NTHL1 gene to chromosome 16p13.3-p13.2.

ANIMAL MODEL

Ocampo et al. (2002) found that the phenotype of Nth1 -/- mice was
indistinguishable from that of wildtype mice. They found that loss of
Nth1 activity was compensated for by enzymatic activity that recognized
oxidized thymine in DNA, particularly when paired with guanine.

DESCRIPTION For background information on histones, histone gene clusters, and the
H1 histone family, see HIST1H1A (142709).

CLONING

Eick et al. (1989) cloned the genes encoding H1.2 and H1.1 (HIST1H1A;
142709).

GENE FUNCTION

Several reports described an activity that modifies
nitrotyrosine-containing proteins and their immunoreactivity to
antibodies against nitrotyrosine (e.g., Kamisaki et al., 1998). Without
knowing the product of the reaction, this activity has been called a
'denitrase.' These studies used some nonspecific proteins that have
multiple tyrosine residues, e.g., albumin, as substrate to study the
mechanism of the reaction. Irie et al. (2003) developed an assay
strategy for determining the substrate for denitrase combining 2D-gel
electrophoresis and an on-blot enzyme assay. They found that histone
H1.2, an isoform protein of linker histone, was one such substrate. H1.2
has only 1 tyrosine residue in the entire molecule, which ensured the
exact position of the substrate to be involved. It had been reported
that histones are the most prominent nitrated proteins in cancer
tissues. It was also demonstrated that tyrosine nitration of histone H1
occurs in vivo. Conceiving that H1.2 might be an intrinsic substrate for
denitrase, they performed further experiments demonstrating that the
denitrase activity behaves as an enzymatic activity because the reaction
was time-dependent and was destroyed by heat or trypsin treatment. The
activity was shown to be specific for histone H1.2, to differ from
proteasome activity, and to require no additional cofactors.

Konishi et al. (2003) found that histone H1.2 was a cytochrome
c-releasing factor that appeared in the cytoplasm after exposure of
cells to x-ray irradiation. While all nuclear histone H1 forms were
released into the cytoplasm in a p53 (TP53; 191170)-dependent manner
after irradiation, only H1.2 induced cytochrome c release from isolated
mitochondria in a BAK (BAK1; 600516)-dependent manner. Reducing H1.2
expression enhanced cellular resistance to apoptosis induced by x-ray
irradiation or etoposide, but not that induced by other apoptotic
stimuli. Thymocytes and small intestines of H1.2-deficient mice
exhibited increased cellular resistance to x-ray-induced apoptosis.
Konishi et al. (2003) concluded that histone H1.2 has a role in
transmitting apoptotic signals from the nucleus to the mitochondria
following DNA double-strand breaks.

See HIST1H1A (142709) for additional functional information on H1
histones.

MAPPING

By PCR analysis of chromosomal DNA from a panel of human/rodent somatic
cell hybrids and by fluorescence in situ hybridization, Albig et al.
(1993) demonstrated that 6 human histone H1 genes, including H1.2, are
located on chromosome 6p22.2-p21.1. By analysis of a YAC contig, Albig
et al. (1997) mapped the H1.2 gene to chromosome 6p21.3 within a cluster
of 35 histone genes, including H1.1 to H1.4 (HIST1H1E; 142220) and H1T
(HIST1H1T; 142712). The H1.5 gene (HIST1H1B; 142711) is part of a
separate subcluster within the same chromosomal region.

By genomic sequence analysis, Marzluff et al. (2002) determined that the
histone gene cluster on chromosome 6p22-p21, which they called histone
gene cluster-1 (HIST1), contains 55 histone genes, including HIST1H1C.

300339	TITLE *300339 PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 2, REGULATORY SUBUNIT B-DOUBLE PRIME, BETA; PPP2R3B
;;PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 2A, REGULATORY SUBUNIT, 48-KD; PR48
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a heterotrimeric serine/threonine
phosphatase, exerts regulatory control over the initiation of DNA
replication and has a particularly complex set of regulatory subunits
controlling its function and localization; see PPP2CA (176915). The PP2A
holoenzyme is composed of 3 subunits, A, B, and C. The structural A
subunit and the catalytic C subunit form a catalytic core, while
substrate specificity is directed by the B subunit.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human placenta cDNA library for
proteins that bind to Cdc6 (CDC18L; 602627), Yan et al. (2000)
identified PR48, a regulatory subunit of PP2A. PR48 was also identified
and named NY-REN-8 by Scanlan et al. (1999) during a serologic analysis
of cDNA expression libraries derived from renal cell carcinoma patients.
PR48 encodes a deduced 414-amino acid protein that shares amino acid
sequence homology with B-double prime subunits of PP2A, including mouse
and human PPP2R3A (604944). Using RT-PCR, Scanlan et al. (1999) detected
PR48 expression in lung, testis, small intestine, breast, liver, and
placenta. Using recombinant baculovirus infections, Yan et al. (2000)
demonstrated that PR48 forms a functional holoenzyme complex with the A
and C subunits of PP2A. They localized PR48 to the nucleus of mammalian
cells using subcellular fractionation experiments and fluorescence
microscopy. With transfection experiments, they demonstrated that forced
overexpression of PR48 perturbs cell cycle progression, causing a G1
arrest. Yan et al. (2000) concluded that PR48 is a bona fide subunit of
the PP2A holoenzyme and that PR48 forms a complex with CDC6 through a
specific interaction with the N-terminal region of CDC6.

604065	TITLE *604065 CALCIUM CHANNEL, VOLTAGE-DEPENDENT, T TYPE, ALPHA-1G SUBUNIT; CACNA1G
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Voltage-activated calcium channels can be distinguished based on their
voltage-dependence, deactivation, and single-channel conductance. See
601011. Low-voltage-activated calcium channels are referred to as 'T'
type because their currents are both transient, owing to fast
inactivation, and tiny, owing to small conductance. T-type channels are
thought to be involved in pacemaker activity, low-threshold calcium
spikes, neuronal oscillations and resonance, and rebound burst firing.

CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences related to calcium channels,
Perez-Reyes et al. (1998) identified a partial human cDNA encoding a
novel channel that they designated alpha-1G or Ca(V)T.1. The authors
used the partial cDNA to isolate additional human, rat, and mouse
alpha-1G cDNAs. Northern blot analysis of human and rat tissues
indicated that the alpha-1G gene was expressed as an 8.5-kb mRNA
predominantly in brain. An additional 9.7-kb transcript was also
detected. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, the rat alpha-1G channel
exhibited the properties of a low-voltage-activated T-type calcium
channel.

Jagannathan et al. (2002) found that multiple isoforms of CACNA1G and at
least 2 isoforms of CACNA1H (607904) are generated by alternative
splicing and are expressed in testis. In situ hybridization localized
transcripts both in germ cells and in other testis cell types. Within
cardiac tissue, both CACNA1G and CACNA1H were expressed in vascular
tissue and not in myocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

By whole-cell patch clamp, Jagannathan et al. (2002) detected T-type
voltage-operated Ca(2+) channel currents in isolated round spermatids.
Currents were consistent with those generated by CACNA1H or CACNA1G
channels.

By action potential clamp studies, Chemin et al. (2002) found
significant differences in the biochemical properties of CACNA1G,
CACNA1H, and CACNA1I (608230) following transient transfection in human
embryonic kidney cells. Using firing activities recorded in dissociated
rat cerebellar Purkinje neurons and thalamocortical relay neurons as
voltage-clamp waveforms, they showed that CACNA1I currents contributed
to sustained electrical activities, while CACNA1G and CACNA1H currents
generated short burst firing. Chemin et al. (2002) hypothesized that
each of the T-channel pore-forming subunits displays specific gating
properties that uniquely contribute to neuronal firing and that CACNA1I
channels provide pacemaker activity.

MAPPING

By FISH and radiation hybrid analysis, Perez-Reyes et al. (1998) mapped
the CACNA1G gene to 17q22. Using interspecific backcross analysis, they
mapped the mouse Cacna1g gene to the distal portion of chromosome 11, in
a region showing homology of synteny with 17q22.

ANIMAL MODEL

To investigate whether T-type Ca(2+) channels in thalamocortical relay
(TC) neurons are involved in the generation of spike-and-wave discharges
(SWDs), Kim et al. (2001) used gene targeting to generate a null
mutation of CACNA1G that encodes the pore-forming subunit of T-type
Ca(2+) channels. The knockout mice grew normally and were fertile.
General development of the brain and major organs appeared normal. Using
pharmacologic models, Kim et al. (2001) analyzed the ability of mutant
mice to generate SWDs. The thalamocortical relay neurons of the knockout
mice lacked the burst mode firing of action potentials, whereas they
showed the normal pattern of tonic mode firing. The knockout thalamus
was specifically resistant to the generation of SWDs in response to
GABA-B receptor (see 603540) activation. Kim et al. (2001) concluded
that the modulation of the intrinsic firing pattern mediated by CACNA1G
T-type Ca(2+) channels plays a critical role in the generation of GABA-B
receptor-mediated SWDs in the thalamocortical pathway, the hallmark of
absence seizures.

Sensations from viscera, like fullness, easily become painful if the
stimulus persists. Kim et al. (2003) demonstrated that mice lacking
alpha 1G T-type calcium channels show hyperalgesia to visceral pain.
Thalamic infusion of a T-type blocker induced similar hyperalgesia in
wildtype mice. In response to visceral pain, the ventroposterolateral
thalamic neurons evoked a surge of single spikes, which then slowly
decayed as T type-dependent burst spikes gradually increased. In
alpha-1G-deficient neurons, the single-spike response persisted without
burst spikes. Kim et al. (2003) concluded that T-type calcium channels
underlie an antinociceptive mechanism operating in the thalamus and that
their findings support the idea that burst firing plays a critical role
in sensory gating in the thalamus.

606214	TITLE *606214 SPECTRIN, BETA, NONERYTHROCYTIC, 4; SPTBN4
;;SPECTRIN, BETA-IV;;
QUIVERING, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; QV
DESCRIPTION Spectrins (e.g., SPTA1; 182860) are rod-shaped proteins that are part of
the lattice-like cytoskeleton under the erythrocyte membrane. This
meshwork is critical for the maintenance of plasma membrane shape and
lipid asymmetry, as revealed by mutant spectrins in diseases such as
elliptocytosis (see 182860) and spherocytosis (see 182870). Although
originally identified in erythrocytes, spectrins have also been found in
the membranes of intracellular organelles, such as the Golgi, lysosomes,
and secretory vesicles. The spectrin molecule is a tetramer consisting
of 2 alpha and 2 beta subunits, in which the N terminus of an alpha
subunit is tightly connected with the C terminus of a beta subunit to
form a heterodimer. Spectrin repeats contain approximately 106 amino
acids. Alpha subunits have 20 spectrin repeats, while beta subunits have
17.

CLONING

By screening a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA library for cDNAs with
the potential to encode large proteins, Nagase et al. (2000) isolated a
partial cDNA encoding SPTBN4, which they called KIAA1642. RT-PCR
analysis detected ubiquitous expression of SPTBN4, with relatively high
levels in adult and fetal brain, low levels in lung, liver, pancreas,
and spleen, and intermediate levels in the other tissues tested and in
specific brain regions.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a brain cDNA library with the
cytoplasmic domain of ICA512 (PTPRN; 601773) as bait, followed by
probing a brain cDNA library, PCR, and genomic sequence analysis, Berghs
et al. (2000) isolated cDNAs encoding SPTBN4 and several splice
variants. Sequence analysis predicted that the full-length 2,559-amino
acid SPTBN4 protein, designated sigma-1, contains 2 N-terminal calponin
homology domains, which mediate interactions with actin; 16 complete
spectrin repeats; 1 partial spectrin repeat; a unique proline-rich,
basic domain containing 4 ERQES repeats; numerous SH3 binding sites; and
a C-terminal pleckstrin homology domain. An insertion in exon 17 termed
exon 17b yields a 1,302-residue splice variant, sigma-2, which
terminates in spectrin repeat 9, and another variant, sigma-3, which
begins at exon 17b to generate a 1,307-amino acid protein. Variant
sigma-4 has an insertion in exon 30 termed exon 30b that introduces 42
amino acids and a stop codon, resulting in a 2,149-amino acid protein
that lacks the ERQES and pleckstrin homology domains. Binding analysis
indicated that the C terminus of SPTBN4 binds to PTPRN and only weakly
to an active tyrosine phosphatase mutant of PTPRN and to PHOGRIN
(601698). Northern blot analysis revealed expression of 9.0-, 5.1-, and
3.1-kb SPTBN4 transcripts that were predominantly expressed in brain.
Western blot analysis showed expression of 250- and 160-kD proteins in
rat brain and human pancreatic islets, as well as a 140-kD protein in
rat brain only. Phosphatase treatment indicated that the 160-kD protein
is phosphorylated, probably in the ERQES domain, which modifies its
interaction with cytoskeletal and membrane proteins. Immunocytochemistry
and confocal microscopy demonstrated coexpression of PTPRN and SPTBN4 in
both insulin-secreting beta cells and glucagon-secreting alpha cells. In
situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry suggested coexpression of
SPTBN4 and ankyrin-G (ANK3; 600465) in rat brain.

Tse et al. (2001) cloned SPTBN4, which they termed SPTBN3, as well as a
splice variant, sigma-5, encoding a 678-amino acid protein. Whole-mount
in situ hybridization analysis revealed Sptbn4 expression that was
restricted to forebrain, hindbrain, and developing eye in postcoital
day-9.5 mice. Western blot analysis with polyclonal antibodies detected
expression of a predominant 72-kD protein, close to the expected size of
the sigma-5 variant. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated
colocalization of SPTBN4 with PML (102578) and with SUMO1 (UBL1; 601912)
in the cytoplasm and nucleus. The authors showed that both the N- and
C-terminal helical coils of sigma-5 are needed to form nuclear dots and
are associated with the nuclear matrix. Tse et al. (2001) proposed that
a spectrin-based skeleton may be important for the structure of the
nucleus.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Berghs et al. (2000) determined that the
SPTBN4 gene contains 36 exons. Tse et al. (2001) determined that the
SPTBN4 gene spans over 145 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the SPTBN4
gene to chromosome 19. Berghs et al. (2000) localized the gene to
19q13.13 by FISH. They identified a highly related gene that resides on
chromosome 16. Tse et al. (2001) mapped the SPTBN4 gene to
19q13.13-q13.2 by radiation hybrid analysis. Berghs et al. (2000) and
Tse et al. (2001) mapped the mouse Spnb4 gene to chromosome 7b2.

ANIMAL MODEL

The autosomal recessive mouse mutation 'quivering' (qv), described by
Yoon and Les (1957), produces progressive ataxia with hindlimb
paralysis, deafness, and tremor. Ear twitch responses (Preyer reflex) to
sound are absent in homozygous qv/qv mice, although cochlear morphology
seems normal and cochlear potentials recorded at the round window are no
different from those of control mice. However, responses from brainstem
auditory nuclei show abnormal transmission of auditory inflammation,
indicating that in contrast to the many mutations causing deafness
originating in the cochlea, deafness in qv is central in origin (Deol et
al., 1983; Bock et al., 1983). Parkinson et al. (2001) reported that qv
mice carry loss-of-function mutations in the Spnb4 gene that cause
alterations in ion channel localization in myelinated nerves. They
concluded that this finding provides a rationale for the auditory and
motor neuropathies of these mice.

606694	TITLE *606694 NUCLEOPORIN, 155-KD; NUP155
;;KIAA0791
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Nucleoporins, such as NUP155, are the main components of the nuclear
pore complex (NPC) of eukaryotic cells. They are involved in
bidirectional trafficking of molecules, especially mRNAs and proteins,
through the nuclear pores between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in
eukaryotic cells (summary by Gorlich and Mattaj, 1996).

CLONING

Using a combination of positional and in silico cloning, Zhang et al.
(1999) obtained the human NUP155 cDNA sequence. The full-length cDNA
encodes a 1,391-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of
about 155 kD. The protein shares 91% sequence identity with the rat
homolog, including an identical stretch of 6 amino acids (GVRLYF). Like
the rat homolog, it is a member of the nonrepetitive/WGA-negative class
of nucleoporins. Neither possesses the typical repeat sequences of FG,
FXFG, or GLFG found in most types of vertebrate nucleoporins. Unlike the
rat protein, the human protein contains a leucine zipper in its N
terminus. Like other nucleoporins, it contains numerous potential
phosphorylation sites. Northern blot analysis detected a major 5.4-kb
transcript in all tissues tested, but predominantly in heart, placenta,
liver, and skeletal muscle, and a minor 4.7-kb transcript in some
tissues tested, consistent with the finding of 2 alternative
polyadenylation sites in the cDNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Hawryluk-Gara et al. (2005) identified human NUP205 (614352), NUP93
(614351), NUP155, and NUP53 (NUP35; 608140) as components of a
nucleoporin subcomplex. In vitro protein binding assays showed that both
NUP53 and NUP93 could bind NUP155 and NUP205 and that NUP53 and NUP93
could bind each other. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown
of NUP53 in HeLa cells resulted in slow growth, abnormal nuclear
morphology, and loss of NUP93, NUP155, and NUP205 proteins. Knockdown of
NUP53 also reduced the level of MAD1 (MXD1; 600021), which binds to
nuclear pore complexes during interphase. Depletion of NUP93 via siRNA
resulted in changes similar to those seen with NUP53 depletion, except
that NUP93 depletion had no effect on MAD1 level.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the NUP155
gene, which they called KIAA0791, to chromosome 5. By FISH, Zhang et al.
(1999) localized the NUP155 gene to 5p13.

614030	TITLE *614030 SPEEDY, XENOPUS, HOMOLOG OF, C; SPDYC
;;RAPID INDUCER OF G2/M PROGRESSION IN OOCYTES, XENOPUS, HOMOLOG OF,
C;;
RINGO C
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SPDYC activates cyclin-dependent kinases (e.g., CDK2; 116953) and
positively regulates cell cycle progression during the late S and G2
phases (Cheng and Solomon, 2008).

CLONING

By searching EST databases for sequences similar to Xenopus Speedy/Ringo
(see SPDYA; 614029), followed by RT-PCR of placenta RNA, Cheng et al.
(2005) cloned SPDYC, which they called Speedy/Ringo C. The deduced
293-amino acid protein contains a highly conserved region of about 140
amino acids, which Cheng et al. (2005) called the Speedy/Ringo box.
Orthologs of SPDYC were detected in cow and pig, but not in mouse and
rat. RT-PCR detected SPDYC expression in human bone marrow, kidney,
small intestine, liver, placenta, and testis, but not in 14 other
tissues.

Using RT-PCR, Cheng and Solomon (2008) found that Speedy/Ringo C was
expressed in K562 erythroleukemia cells and HEK293 cells, but not in
A549 lung carcinoma cells or HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Cheng et al. (2005) found that recombinant human SPDYC bound and
activated CDC2 (CDK1; 116940) and CDK2 in vitro and in transfected
HEK293 cells.

Cheng and Solomon (2008) showed that downregulation of SPDYC via RNA
interference in HEK293 cells inhibited cell growth, reduced the fraction
of cells in G1, and increased the fraction of cells in S and G2.
Conversely, ectopic expression of SPDYC caused cell cycle arrest at the
G1-to-S transition, elevated levels of p21 (CDKN1A; 116899) and p27
(CDKN1B; 600778), increased cell death, and decreased the fraction of
cells in S and G2/M. Consistent with its role as a CDK activator, FACS
analysis indicated that overexpression of SPDYC accelerated late S phase
progression and disrupted the G2 DNA damage checkpoint. Cheng and
Solomon (2008) concluded that, in contrast with SPDYA, which functions
during the G1/S transition and S phase progression, SPDYC regulates S
and G2 phase progression and may trigger mitotic entry.

Mouron et al. (2010) found that knockdown of Ringo C in U2OS human
osteosarcoma cells resulted in premature mitotic exit and misaligned
chromosomes. Ringo C-depleted cells showed checkpoint defects, resulting
in chromosome missegregation and an increased number of micronuclei and
binucleated structures. Time-lapse microscopy revealed that Ringo C was
involved in the spindle-assembly checkpoint (SAC). Depletion of Ringo C
resulted in impaired recruitment of the SAC components MAD2 (MAD2L1;
601467), BUB1 (602452), and BUBR1 (BUB1B; 602860) and triggered
premature activation of anaphase-promoting complex (see 608473)-mediated
degradation of cyclin B (CCNB1; 123836). Ringo C associated with the
mitotic kinase Aurora B (AURKB; 604970) via a domain separate from its
CDK-binding domain. Downregulation of Ringo C produced mislocalization
of the active form of Aurora B in prometaphase. Mouron et al. (2010)
concluded that Ringo C has a role in mitotic checkpoint, recruitment of
SAC components, and proper localization of Aurora kinase B.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the SPDYC gene to chromosome 11q13.1 based on an
alignment of the SPDYC sequence (GenBank GENBANK AY820305) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

614463	TITLE *614463 NMYC DOWNSTREAM-REGULATED GENE 4; NDRG4
;;SMOOTH MUSCLE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 8; SMAP8;;
KIAA1180
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Hirosawa et al. (1999) cloned NDRG4. The deduced protein
contains 273 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA detected highest expression in
adult and fetal brain and adult heart, followed by lung and testis.
Lower expression was detected in other adult tissues examined, but
little to no expression was detected in fetal liver. High NDRG4
expression was detected in all specific adult brain regions examined,
with highest expression in amygdala, cerebellum, and thalamus.

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to NDRG1 (605262),
followed by 3-prime and 5-prime RACE of human brain and heart cDNA
libraries and cap-site hunting, Zhou et al. (2001) cloned 3 splice
variants of NDRG4. The variants NDRG4B and NDRG4B-var, which were
obtained from the brain library, encode deduced proteins of 339 and 352
amino acids with calculated molecular masses of 37.1 and 38.5 kD,
respectively. Compared with NDRG4B, NDRG4B-var has a 14-amino acid
insertion near the C terminus. The variant NDRG4H, which was obtained
from the heart library, encodes a deduced 371-amino acid protein with a
calculated molecular mass of 40.6 kD. NDRG4H differs from NDRG4B and
NDRG4B-var at its N-terminal end, and it lacks the 14-amino acid
insertion. Northern blot analysis detected NDRG4 transcripts of about
3.2 kb in brain and heart only. Variant-specific probes showed NDRG4B
expression in brain only, whereas NDRG4H was expressed in both brain and
heart, with higher expression in heart. RT-PCR confirmed expression of
all 3 variants in brain and of NDRG4H in heart. RNA dot-blot analysis
revealed NDRG4 expression in spinal cord, all specific brain regions
examined, and all specific heart regions examined except aorta.
Expression was also detected in spleen, lymph node, testis, adrenal
gland, and fetal brain and heart, but not in other tissues examined. In
situ hybridization of normal adult brain detected NDRG4 mRNA in
cytoplasm of neurons in cerebral cortex, cerebellum, mesencephalon,
pons, medulla oblongata, and spinal cord. No signal was detected in
peripheral nerves or other cell types, such as glial cells. Western blot
analysis of endogenous or exogenously expressed proteins showed that
NDRG4B, NDRG4B-var, and NDRG4H had apparent molecular masses of 37, 39,
and 41 kD, respectively.

Using expression profiling to identify genes expressed in aortic smooth
muscle, followed by screening a heart cDNA library, Nishimoto et al.
(2003) cloned NDRG4, which they called SMAP8. The deduced 371-amino acid
protein has a calculated molecular mass of 40.7 kD. Northern blot
analysis detected high expression of an approximately 3.3-kb transcript
in heart and brain, with little to no expression in other tissues
examined. PCR analysis showed moderate expression in aorta and vascular
smooth muscle cells. Western blot analysis of heart and brain detected
SMAP8 at an apparent molecular mass of about 45 kD. SMAP8 localized to
the cytoplasmic fraction of transfected A10 embryonic rat aortic smooth
muscle cells.

By in situ hybridization of adult mouse brain, Yamamoto et al. (2011)
detected wide distribution of Ndrg4 in neurons, but not in astrocytes.
Western blot analysis of adult mouse brain detected 3 Ndrg4 isoforms
representing orthologs of human NDRG4B, NDRG4B-var, and NDRG4H.

GENE FUNCTION

Nishimoto et al. (2003) showed that homocysteine upregulated SMAP8
expression in primary human aortic smooth muscle cells and rat A10
cells, but not in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Proliferation
and migration of A10 cells significantly decreased following expression
of human SMAP8. SMAP8 was phosphorylated by a serine/threonine kinase
via activation of a PDGF (see 173430) signaling pathway. In addition,
ERK1 (MAPK3; 601795)/ERK2 (MAPK1; 176948) and MEK1 (MAP2K1; 176872)/MEK2
(MAP2K2; 601263) were activated in SMAP8-transfected A10 cells.

Hongo et al. (2006) found that overexpression of 1 of the 6 isoforms of
rat Ndrg4, Ndrg4c2, in PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells reduced NGF (see
162030)-induced phosphorylation of Elk1 (311040), a nuclear target of
Erk. Reporter gene assays revealed that Ndrg4c2 suppressed Elk1-mediated
activation of a serum response element.

By RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analysis, Schilling et al. (2009)
found that NDRG4 expression was increased in glioblastoma multiforme
(GBM; see 137800) compared with normal human astrocytes. Knockdown of
NDRG4 via short hairpin RNA reduced the viability of GBM cells via G1
cell cycle arrest and subsequent apoptosis. Knockdown of NDRG4 also
reduced the viability of several GBM cell lines and primary astrocytes.
Knockdown of NDRG4 in GBM tumor xenografts reduced tumor growth
following intracranial injection in immunocompromised mice.
Overexpression of NDRG4B or NDRG4H did not affect cell viability.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhou et al. (2001) determined that the NDRG4 gene contains 17 exons and
spans 26 kb. Exons 1 and 2 are specific for NDRG4H, exon 3 is specific
for NDRG4B and NDGR4B-var, and exon 16 is specific for NDRG4B-var. The
region upstream of exon 1 contains a GGCG sequence that may represent a
TATA-less promoter for NDRG4H expression. The region upstream of exon 3
contains a consensus TATA box and 2 CCAAT sequences and may represent
the promoter for NDRG4B and NDRG4B-var expression.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Zhou et al. (2001) mapped the NDRG4 gene
to chromosome 16q21-q22.3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yamamoto et al. (2011) found that Ndrg4 -/- mice were born at the
expected mendelian ratio, appeared normal, and were fertile. However,
Ndrg4 -/- mice showed deficits in spatial learning and memory, and they
exhibited increased sensitivity to ischemic stress following middle
cerebral artery occlusion. Consistent with these findings, Ndrg4 -/-
mice had reduced expression of the neuroprotective factor Bdnf (113505).

608424	TITLE *608424 MUCIN 17; MUC17
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Membrane mucins, such as MUC17, function in epithelial cells to provide
cytoprotection, maintain luminal structure, provide signal transduction,
and confer antiadhesive properties upon cancer cells that lose their
apical/basal polarization.

CLONING

By database searching and RT-PCR to extend a partial mucin-like sequence
found during analysis of MUC3 (see 158371), Gum et al. (2002) cloned
MUC17. The deduced 1,029-amino acid protein contains 5 N-terminal thr-,
ser-, and pro-rich tandem repeats, followed by a region with degenerate
tandem repeats and mucin-like sequences; 2 EGF (131530)-like domains
separated by a SEA module; a putative transmembrane domain; and a
C-terminal cytoplasmic domain with potential serine and tyrosine
phosphorylation sites. RNA dot blot analysis of several tissues detected
highest expression in duodenum and transverse colon. The only
nonintestinal tissues that expressed MUC17 were stomach and fetal
kidney. Expression was also detected in several colon and pancreatic
cancer cell lines. In situ hybridization showed MUC17 expression
predominantly in the apical region of mature intestinal absorptive
epithelial cells. Barely detectable expression was found in immature
cells of the crypts.

Using real-time RT-PCR, Moehle et al. (2006) found that MUC17 was highly
expressed in adult small intestine, followed by stomach and colon. Weak
expression was detected in prostate and uterus, with no expression
detected in other tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

By microarray analysis, Moehle et al. (2006) found coordinated
downregulation of mucins, including MUC17, in colon of patients with
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; see 266600), including Crohn disease
and ulcerative colitis, compared with controls. They identified an
NF-kappa-B (see 164011)-binding site in the MUC17 promoter and showed
that activation of the NF-kappa-B signaling pathway by inflammatory
cytokines TNF-alpha (TNF; 191160) and TGF-beta (TGFB1; 190180)
upregulated MUC17 mRNA expression about 2-fold and 3-fold, respectively.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Gum et al. (2002) mapped the MUC17 gene to
chromosome 7q22.

614584	TITLE *614584 PROLYL 4-HYDROXYLASE, TRANSMEMBRANE; P4HTM
;;PROLINE HYDROXYLASE 4; PH4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

P4HTM belongs to a family of enzymes that downregulate expression of
hypoxia-induced transcription factors (HIFs; see 603348) under normoxic
conditions. These enzymes hydroxylate specific proline residues within
HIF oxygen-dependent degradation domains, inducing their
proteasome-dependent degradation (Oehme et al., 2002).

CLONING

By searching EST databases for sequences similar to the collagen prolyl
4-hydroxylase P4HA1 (176710), followed by RT-PCR of human brain mRNA,
Oehme et al. (2002) cloned P4HTM, which they called PH4. The deduced
502-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 56.7 kD. The
N-terminal half of PH4 has a transmembrane domain and an EF-hand motif,
and the C-terminal half has a putative catalytic domain containing iron-
and oxoglutarate-binding motifs. Quantitative RT-PCR detected variable
PH4 expression in the 17 human tissues examined, with highest expression
in brain, followed by adrenal gland and kidney. Lowest expression was
detected in prostate. Epitope-tagged PH4 colocalized with an endoplasmic
reticulum tracer in transfected COS-7 cells.

Koivunen et al. (2007) found that the full-length 502-amino acid P4HTM
protein contains a putative endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal
and 2 potential N-glycosylation sites. Northern blot analysis detected
P4HTM transcripts of 2.7, 2.3, and 1.8 kb in several human tissues. The
1.8-kb transcript was the main form in all tissues except brain. PCR
analysis detected P4HTM in human epiphyseal cartilage and fibroblasts
and in all tumor samples tested. N-end sequencing revealed that
endogenous and recombinant P4HTM proteins were expressed as full-length
forms and N-terminally truncated forms that began with asp88. Gel
filtration and Western blot analysis detected both full-length and
N-terminally truncated P4HTM in fractions corresponding to molecular
masses of about 105 to 120 kD and 85 to 90 kD, respectively.
Immunoelectron microscopy revealed that the catalytic domain of P4HTM
was expressed on the luminal face of ER membranes. Database analysis
revealed orthologs of P4HTM in vertebrates only.

GENE FUNCTION

Using transfected COS-7 cells, Oehme et al. (2002) showed that human
PH4, like EGLN3 (606426), reduced the transactivation activities of
mouse Hif1-alpha (HIF1A; 603348) and Hif2-alpha (EPAS1; 603349) on a
reporter construct containing tandem hypoxia-responsive elements. Loss
of Hif2-alpha activity correlated with loss of Hif2-alpha protein. Oehme
et al. (2002) hypothesized that PH4 has a role in cellular oxygen
sensing.

By Western blot analysis, Koivunen et al. (2007) found that hypoxia
induced expression of P4HTM in several human cell lines and in adult
human fibroblasts. Overexpression of P4HTM reduced the cellular content
of the isolated transfected HIF1-alpha and HIF2-alpha oxygen-dependent
degradation domains. In contrast, small interfering RNA-mediated
silencing of P4HTM increased full-length HIF1-alpha content. Purified
recombinant P4HTM hydroxylated prolines in HIF1-alpha at 2 sites, with
preference for the more C-terminal site. P4HTM also catalyzed an
uncoupled decarboxylation of 2-oxoglutarate, but it did not hydroxylate
procollagen polypeptides in vitro.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the P4HTM gene to chromosome 3p21.31 based on an
alignment of the P4HTM sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK000269) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

125305	TITLE *125305 ERYTHROCYTE MEMBRANE PROTEIN BAND 4.9; EPB49
;;DEMATIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Dematin, or EPB49, is an actin-bundling protein originally identified in
the erythroid membrane skeleton. Its actin-bundling activity is
abolished upon phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and is
restored after dephosphorylation (Rana et al., 1993).

CLONING

Chishti et al. (1989) proposed the name dematin (from the Greek 'dema,'
a bundle) for an actin-bundling protein identified in the human
erythroid membrane skeleton. Rana et al. (1993) noted that dematin
consists of 2 polypeptide chains of 48 and 52 kD that were identified as
protein 4.9 on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. In solution, dematin exists as a
trimer and bundles actin filaments in a phosphorylation-dependent
manner. Rana et al. (1993) cloned dematin from a human reticulocyte cDNA
library. The deduced 383-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of 43 kD. Dematin has a polyglutamine motif that may constitute a
nuclear localization signal, a PEST sequence, a C-terminal domain highly
similar to the C-terminal headpiece domain of villin (VIL; 193040), and
several putative phosphorylation sites. Northern blot analysis detected
variable dematin expression in all tissues examined. Immunofluorescence
microscopy revealed punctate dematin staining around the cell nucleus in
cultured human erythroblasts.

Although dematin is an actin-bundling protein of the erythroid membrane
skeleton, it is abundantly expressed in human brain, heart, skeletal
muscle, kidney, and lung. Azim et al. (1995) reported the primary
structure of the 52-kD subunit of dematin, which differs from the 48-kD
subunit by a 22-amino acid insertion within its headpiece domain. A
unique feature of the insertion sequence of the 52-kD subunit is its
homology to erythrocyte protein 4.2 (177070).

GENE FUNCTION

Rana et al. (1993) confirmed that purified human dematin possessed
actin-bundling activity in vitro. Protease treatment and microsequencing
revealed that the C-terminal headpiece domain bound actin filaments, but
it did not have actin-bundling activity.

Azim et al. (1996) demonstrated that dematin and protein 4.2 bound ATP.

Gilligan and Bennett (1993) provided a review.

MAPPING

Using somatic cell hybrid panels and fluorescence in situ hybridization,
Azim et al. (1995) localized the dematin gene to chromosome 8p21.1, a
site distal to the locus of ankyrin (612641) at chromosome 8p11.2.

Peters et al. (1995) demonstrated that the murine dematin gene,
symbolized Epb4.9, maps to chromosome 14. They raised the possibility
that dematin mutations may be involved in neurologic abnormalities in
the mouse.

ANIMAL MODEL

By using homologous recombination in mouse embryonic stem cells, Khanna
et al. (2002) deleted the headpiece domain of dematin to evaluate its
function in vivo. Dematin headpiece-null mice were viable and born at
the expected mendelian ratio. Hematologic evaluation showed evidence of
compensated anemia and spherocytosis in these mice, however. The
headpiece-null erythrocytes were osmotically fragile, and displayed
reduced deformability and filterability. In vitro, significantly greater
membrane fragmentation of these erythrocytes was demonstrated.
Biochemical characterization showed a weakened membrane skeleton
evidenced by reduced association of spectrin and actin to the plasma
membrane. Together, these results provided evidence for the physiologic
significance of dematin and demonstrated a role for the headpiece domain
in the maintenance of structural integrity and mechanical properties of
red cells in vivo.

Chen et al. (2007) created double-knockout mice lacking beta-adducin
(ADD2; 102681) and the headpiece domain of dematin. Double-knockout pups
were pale compared with wildtype pups, but otherwise they appeared
grossly normal. Peripheral blood analysis showed severe hemolytic anemia
with reduced number of erythrocytes/hematocrit/hemoglobin and an
approximately 12-fold increase in the number of circulating
reticulocytes. The presence of a variety of misshapen and fragmented
erythrocytes correlated with increased osmotic fragility and reduced in
vivo life span. Mutant erythrocyte membranes showed weak retention of
spectrin-actin complexes, increased grain size, decreased filament
number, and features consistent with the presence of large protein
aggregates. Chen et al. (2007) concluded that dematin and adducin are
essential for the maintenance of erythrocyte shape and membrane
stability.

602064	TITLE *602064 MYO-INOSITOL MONOPHOSPHATASE 1; IMPA1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

McAllister et al. (1992) cloned the gene encoding human enzyme IMPase
(IMPA1).

GENE STRUCTURE

Sjoholt et al. (1997) determined the genomic structure of the human
IMPA1 gene. They found that it is composed of at least 9 exons and
covers more than 20 kb of sequence on 8q21.13-q21.3. In the 3-prime
untranslated part of the gene, they observed a G-to-A transition and
also 2 short sequences similar to the inositol/cholin-responsive element
consensus. They postulated that 2 additional IMPA-like transcripts
originate from the human genome, 1 from a position close to IMPA1 itself
on chromosome 8 and the other from 18p.

GENE FUNCTION

Manic depressive psychosis (125480) is a serious psychiatric disorder
that in many, but far from all, patients can be treated with lithium.
IMPase has been postulated as a target for the mood-stabilizing effects
of lithium. Variation in the 277-codon coding region of IMPA1 has not
been observed in manic-depressive patients (Steen et al., 1996). Sjoholt
et al. (1997) suggested that polymorphisms or mutations in the noncoding
regions of this gene could influence the lithium response in psychiatric
patients.

In studies on the effect of lithium on Xenopus morphogenesis, Klein and
Melton (1996) concluded that lithium acts through inhibition of glycogen
synthase kinase beta-3 (GSK3B; 605004), and not through inhibition of
IMPase. The authors suggested that their observations could provide
insights into the pathogenesis and treatment of bipolar disorder.

MAPPING

By PCR analysis of both CEPH megabase-insert YAC DNA pools and
human/rodent somatic cell hybrid DNAs, Sjoholt et al. (1997) mapped the
IMPA1 gene to 8q21.13-q21.3.

605921	TITLE *605921 STROMAL INTERACTION MOLECULE 1; STIM1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

STIM1 is a calcium sensor that conveys the calcium load of the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to store-operated channels (SOCs) at the
plasma membrane (Yuan et al., 2007).

CLONING

Using sequences identified by database searching with a transcript from
human chromosome 11p15.5, Parker et al. (1996) screened placental and
fetal liver cDNA libraries and cloned a novel cDNA, STIM1, which they
called GOK. The deduced 746-amino acid protein contains a predicted
signal peptide and transmembrane helix. Parker et al. (1996) also cloned
a partial mouse Stim1 genomic clone and found that the human and mouse
proteins share 90% sequence identity.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhang et al. (2005) showed that overexpression of EF-hand mutants of
Stim or STIM1 activated calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC)
channels constitutively without changing calcium store content. By
immunofluorescence, electron microscopy localization, and surface
biotinylation they showed that STIM1 migrates from endoplasmic
reticulum-like sites to the plasma membrane (PM) upon depletion of the
calcium store. Zhang et al. (2005) proposed that STIM1 functions as the
missing link between calcium store depletion and store-operated calcium
(SOC) influx, serving as a calcium sensor that translocates upon store
depletion to the PM to activate calcium release-activated calcium
channels.

Roos et al. (2005) found that knockdown of STIM1 significantly reduced
CRAC channel activity in human Jurkat T cells. Knockdown of STIM1 in
human embryonic kidney (HEK293) or neuroblastoma cells inhibited
thapsigargin- or agonist-dependent calcium entry. Conversely,
overexpression of STIM1 in HEK293 cells modestly enhanced
thapsigargin-induced calcium entry.

Yeromin et al. (2006) showed that interaction between wildtype STIM and
ORAI1 (610277), assessed by coimmunoprecipitation, is greatly enhanced
after treatment with thapsigargin to induce calcium ion store depletion.

Soboloff et al. (2006) showed that coexpression of STIM1 and ORAI1
resulted in an enormous gain in function of SOC entry. Expression of
ORAI1 alone inhibited SOC entry. Store-independent Ca(2+) entry was
enhanced by coexpression of ORAI1 and STIM2 (610841), but not STIM1.
Soboloff et al. (2006) concluded that ORAI1 is likely the channel entity
mediating SOC function. They noted that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
and PM localizations of STIM1 and ORAI1, respectively, are consistent
with their roles as ER Ca(2+) sensor and PM Ca(2+) channel,
respectively.

Independently, Mercer et al. (2006) showed that coexpression of STIM1
with ORAI1 resulted in enhanced SOC entry. Coexpression of STIM1 with
ORAI2 (610929) augmented SOC entry to a lesser extent, while ORAI3
(610930) alone or with STIM1 had no effect on SOC entry, although it
could rescue knockdown of ORAI1 function. Fluorescence and confocal
microscopy demonstrated that STIM1 relocated from the ER to the vicinity
of the PM following depletion of calcium stores, but it was not detected
on the cell surface in the presence or absence of ORAI1. Mercer et al.
(2006) proposed that STIM1 regulates or interacts with ORAI1 at sites of
close apposition between the PM and an intracellular STIM1-containing
organelle, such as the ER.

Soboloff et al. (2006) found that STIM2 was a powerful inhibitor of
STIM1-mediated SOC entry when expressed in human and rat cell lines.
Confocal microscopy demonstrated coexpression of STIM1 and STIM2 in
puncta upon store depletion, and immunoprecipitation revealed direct
interaction between STIM1 and STIM2. Soboloff et al. (2006) concluded
that STIM2 interferes with STIM1-mediated SOC entry at a point
downstream of puncta formation.

Takahashi et al. (2007) found that knockdown of STIM1 expression by
small interfering RNA (siRNA) drastically decreased SOC entry in primary
human vascular smooth muscle cells. In contrast, an EF-hand mutant of
STIM1 increased SOC entry, which was abolished by cotransfection of
siRNA against TRPC1 (602343). Knockdown of STIM1 also suppressed
phosphorylation of CREB (CREB1; 123810) and cell growth.

Using mouse or human constructs (Worley, 2008) with human embryonic
kidney cells, Yuan et al. (2007) showed that STIM1 regulated directly or
indirectly all plasma membrane TRPC channels except TRPC7 (TRPM2;
603749). Human STIM1 directly bound human TRPC1 and mouse Trpc4 (603651)
and Trpc5 (300334) and stimulated their function as SOCs. STIM1 did not
directly bind human TRPC3 (602345) or mouse Trpc6 (603652), but
regulated their function indirectly by mediating the
heteromultimerization of TRPC3 with TRPC1 and Trpc6 with Trpc4. STIM1
was required for receptor stimulation of TRPC channels, but it was not a
channel subunit and was not needed for TRPC channel function. The
migration of STIM1 to the plasma membrane appeared to stabilize or
promote the formation of the TRPC1-TRPC3 complex.

Luik et al. (2008) defined the relationships among endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) calcium ion concentration, STIM1 redistribution, and CRAC channel
activation and identified STIM1 oligomerization as a critical ER calcium
concentration-dependent event that drives store-operated calcium ion
entry. In human Jurkat leukemic T cells expressing an ER-targeted
calcium ion indicator, CRAC channel activation and STIM1 redistribution
followed the same function of ER calcium concentration, reaching
half-maximum at about 200 micromolar with a Hill coefficient of
approximately 4. Because STIM1 binds only a single calcium ion, the high
apparent cooperativity suggested that STIM1 must first oligomerize to
enable its accumulation at ER-plasma membrane (PM) junctions. To assess
directly the causal role of STIM1 oligomerization in store-operated
calcium entry, Luik et al. (2008) replaced the luminal calcium-sensing
domain of STIM1 with the 12-kD FK506- and rapamycin-binding protein
(FKBP12; 186945) or the FKBP-rapamycin binding domain of mTOR (601231).
A rapamycin analog oligomerized the fusion proteins and caused them to
accumulate at ER-PM junctions and activate CRAC channels without
depleting calcium from the ER. Thus, Luik et al. (2008) concluded that
STIM1 oligomerization is the critical transduction event through which
calcium ion store depletion controls store-operated calcium entry,
acting as a switch that triggers the self-organization and activation of
STIM1-ORAI1 clusters at ER-PM junctions.

Using confocal microscopy, Lioudyno et al. (2008) demonstrated that both
STIM1 and ORAI1 accumulated in the immunologic synapse of either
activated or resting T cells in contact with antigen-pulsed dendritic
cells. Ca(2+) concentrations were increased near the interface of the
cells, and Ca(2+) signaling could be blocked by an ORAI1
dominant-negative mutant. Lioudyno et al. (2008) concluded that a
positive feedback loop exists in which the initial T-cell receptor
signal favors upregulation of STIM1 and ORAI1, which then augment Ca(2+)
signaling during subsequent antigen encounter.

Using human constructs and cell lines, Muik et al. (2008) showed that
STIM1 and ORAI1 interacted dynamically to activate PM Ca(2+) currents.
ER store depletion caused STIM1-STIM1 multimerization at the ER,
followed by STIM1-ORAI1 cluster formation at the ER-PM interface, and
both interactions were reversed by store refilling. The C terminus of
STIM1, when coexpressed with ORAI1, resulted in constitutive currents in
the absence of STIM1-ORAI1 cluster formation and ER store depletion.
Both N- and C-terminal deletion mutants of ORAI1 failed to generate
Ca(2+) entry or currents upon ER store depletion; the C-terminal ORAI1
mutant failed to interact with STIM1, and the N-terminal ORAI1 mutant,
which interacted with STIM1, exhibited a defect in channel gating.

Yuan et al. (2009) reported the molecular basis for the gating of ORAI1
(610277) by STIM1. All ORAI channels were fully activated by a conserved
STIM1 amino acid fragment (residues 344 to 442), which Yuan et al.
(2009) termed STIM1 ORAI-activating region (SOAR). SOAR acted with STIM1
amino acids 450 to 485 to regulate the strength of the interaction with
ORAI1. Activation of ORAI1 by SOAR recapitulated all the kinetic
properties of activation with full-length STIM1. However, mutations
within SOAR did not affect coclustering of STIM1 and ORAI1 in response
to Ca(2+) store depletion, indicating that coclustering is not
sufficient for ORAI1 activation. SOAR-mediated activation required an
intact alpha-helical region at the C terminus of ORAI1. Deletion of
N-terminal amino acids 1 to 73 of ORAI1 impaired activation by STIM1,
but not by SOAR. In addition, inward rectification of ORAI1 was mediated
by an interaction between the polybasic STIM1 residues 672 to 685 and a
pro-rich region in the N terminus of ORAI1. Yuan et al. (2009) concluded
that the essential properties of ORAI1 function can be understood by
interactions with discrete regions of STIM1.

Park et al. (2010) found that STIM1, the main activator of
store-operated calcium channels, directly suppresses
depolarization-induced opening of the voltage-gated calcium channel
Ca(v)1.2 (114205). STIM1 binds to the C terminus of Ca(v)1.2 through its
calcium release-activated calcium activation domain, acutely inhibits
gating, and causes long-term internalization of the channel from the
membrane. Park et al. (2010) concluded that their results established a
theretofore unknown function for STIM1 and provided a molecular
mechanism to explain the reciprocal regulation of these 2 channels in
cells.

Wang et al. (2010) revealed a regulatory link between Orai channels and
Ca(v)1.2 channels mediated by the ubiquitous calcium-sensing STIM
proteins. STIM1 activation by store depletion or mutational modification
strongly suppresses voltage-operated calcium (Cav1.2) channels while
activating store-operated (Orai) channels. Both actions are mediated by
the short STIM-Orai activating region (SOAR) of STIM1. STIM1 interacts
with Ca(v)1.2 channels and localizes within discrete endoplasmic
reticulum/plasma membrane junctions containing both Ca(v)1.2 and ORAI1
channels. Hence, STIM1 interacts with and reciprocally controls 2 major
calcium channels hitherto thought to operate independently. Wang et al.
(2010) concluded that such coordinated control of the widely expressed
Ca(v)1.2 and Orai channels has major implications for calcium signal
generation in excitable and nonexcitable cells.

Srikanth et al. (2010) found that CRACR2A (EFCAB4B; 614178)
coimmunoprecipitated with ORAI1 (610277), ORAI2 (610929), ORAI3
(610930), and STIM1, suggesting that CRACR2A may have a role in
store-operated calcium channels. Depletion of CRACR2A via small
interfering RNA severely reduced stimulation-induced clustering between
STIM1 and ORAI1. Depletion of CRACR2A in HEK293 cells or CRACR2B
(EFCAB4A; 614177) in Jurkat human T cells also decreased store-operated
calcium entry. Mutation analysis revealed that the EF hands of CRACR2A
mediate calcium-sensitive interaction with ORAI1 and STIM1, and calcium
binding by the EF hands of CRACR2A reduced the interaction of CRACR2A
with ORAI1 and STIM1.

McNally et al. (2012) probed the central features of the STIM1 gating
mechanism in the human CRAC channel protein, ORAI1, and identified the
valine at residue 102 (V102), located in the extracellular region of the
pore, as a candidate for the channel gate. Mutations at V102 produce
constitutively active CRAC channels that are open even in the absence of
STIM1. Unexpectedly, although STIM1-free V102 mutant channels are not
Ca(2+)-selective, their Ca(2+) selectivity is dose-dependently boosted
by interactions with STIM1. Similar enhancement of Ca(2+) selectivity is
also seen in wildtype ORAI1 channels by increasing the number of STIM1
activation domains that are directly tethered to ORAI1 channels, or by
increasing the relative expression of full-length STIM1. Thus, exquisite
Ca(2+) selectivity is not an intrinsic property of CRAC channels but
rather a tuneable feature that is bestowed on otherwise nonselective
ORAI1 channels by STIM1. McNally et al. (2012) concluded that
STIM1-mediated gating of CRAC channels occurs through an unusual
mechanism in which permeation and gating are closely coupled.

Using a genomewide RNA interference screen in HeLa cells, Sharma et al.
(2013) identified filamentous septin proteins, particularly SEPT4
(603696), as crucial regulators of store-operated Ca(2+) entry. Septin
filaments and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2)
rearrange locally at endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane junctions
before and during formation of STIM1-ORAI1 clusters, facilitating STIM1
targeting to these junctions and promoting the stable recruitment of
ORAI1. Septin rearrangement at junctions is required for PtdIns(4,5)P2
reorganization and efficient STIM1-ORAI1 communication. Septins
demarcate specialized membrane regions such as dendritic spines, the
yeast bud, and the primary cilium, and serve as membrane diffusion
barriers and/or signaling hubs in cellular processes such as vesicle
trafficking, cell polarity, and cytokinesis. Sharma et al. (2013)
concluded that their data showed that septins also organize the highly
localized plasma membrane domains that are important in STIM1-ORAI1
signaling, and indicated that septins may organize membrane microdomains
relevant to other signaling processes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sabbioni et al. (1999) determined that the STIM1 gene contains 12 exons
that span more than 250 kb between the RRM1 and NUP98 (601021) genes.

MAPPING

Restriction mapping by pulsed field electrophoresis placed the STIM1
gene 1.7 kb telomeric of the RRM1 gene (180410) on chromosome 11p15.5
(Parker et al., 1996).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Primary Immunodeficiency 10

Picard et al. (2009) reported a consanguineous family from central
Europe in which 3 sibs had primary immunodeficiency-10 (IMD10; 612783).
The disorder was characterized by T-cell immune dysfunction, autoimmune
hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, muscular hypotonia, and defective
enamel dentition. In 2 of the sibs with DNA samples available, they
identified homozygosity for a 1-bp insertion in the STIM1 gene
(605921.0001).

Using whole-exome sequencing, Byun et al. (2010) identified a homozygous
splice-site mutation at the -1 position of exon 8 in the STIM1 gene
(605921.0002) in a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seronegative
Turkish child of consanguineous parents who died at age 2 years from
disseminated Kaposi sarcoma (KS) associated with complete STIM1
deficiency. In addition to the STIM1 splice-site mutation, 11 missense
mutations were identified, but none of the affected genes were
implicated in immunity or selectively expressed in endothelial cells.
RT-PCR analysis of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B cell lines
from the patient showed significantly reduced STIM1 mRNA expression, and
no STIM1 protein was detected by Western blot analysis. Ca(2+) influx
was completely abolished in the patient's EVB-B cells, and expression of
wildtype STIM1 rescued this defect. Byun et al. (2010) concluded that
STIM1 deficiency precipitated the development of lethal classic KS upon
infection with human herpesvirus (HHV)-8, the cause of all forms of KS.

Fuchs et al. (2012) reported 2 Pakistani sisters with STIM1 deficiency
who were homozygous for an arg429-to-cys (R429C; 605921.0003) mutation
in the STIM1 gene that completely abolished store-operated calcium entry
in T cells. Immunologic analysis of the surviving patient showed defects
in T-cell proliferation and cytokine production in vitro, as expected,
but also the generation of significant antiviral T-cell populations in
vivo. The latter cells proliferated in response to viral antigens and
showed normal antiviral cytotoxicity. In spite of this apparent
antiviral immunity, the patient experienced chronic cytomegalovirus and
EBV infections, possibly due to impaired natural killer cell function
and absent natural killer T cells. The patient also experienced
autoimmune cytopenia, eczema, and intermittent diarrhea, suggesting
impaired immune regulation. She possessed FOXP3 (300292)-positive
regulatory T (Treg) cells with an abnormal phenotype but normal
function. Fuchs et al. (2012) proposed that the sum of these partial
defects contribute to the overall pathogenesis of immunodeficiency and
autoimmunity in STIM1 deficiency.

- Tubular Aggregate Myopathy, Autosomal Dominant

In affected members from 4 unrelated families with autosomal dominant
tubular aggregate myopathy (TAM; 160565), Bohm et al. (2013) identified
4 different heterozygous mutations in the intraluminal EF hand domains
of the STIM1 gene (605921.0004-605921.0007). The initial mutations were
identified by whole-exome sequencing. In vitro studies showed that the
mutations induced STIM1 clustering, indicating that calcium sensing was
impaired and resulting in a gain-of-function effect. TAM myoblasts
showed a higher level of basal calcium and dysregulation of
intracellular calcium homeostasis compared to controls. Because
recessive STIM1 loss-of-function mutations are associated with
immunodeficiency, Bohm et al. (2013) concluded that the tissue-specific
impact of STIM1 loss or constitutive activation is different, and that a
tight regulation of STIM1-dependent calcium entry is fundamental for
normal skeletal muscle structure and function. None of the TAM patients
had evidence of immune dysfunction.

ANIMAL MODEL

Braun et al. (2009) showed that mouse macrophages lacking Stim1 could
not activate Fcgr (e.g., 146760)-induced Ca(2+) entry and phagocytosis.
As a consequence, mice lacking Stim1 resisted experimental immune
thrombocytopenia and anaphylaxis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and acute
pneumonitis. Braun et al. (2009) concluded that STIM1 is an essential
component of FCGR activation and proposed that inhibition of STIM1
signaling may have therapeutic potential.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
IMMUNODEFICIENCY 10
STIM1, 1-BP INS, 380A

In 2 sibs from a consanguineous family with primary immunodeficiency-10
(IMD10; 612783) characterized by defective T-cell function, Picard et
al. (2009) identified a homozygous 1-bp insertion (380insA) in exon 3 of
the STIM1 gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination. A
third sib from the family had a similar phenotype, but no DNA sample was
available for testing. There was significantly decreased STIM1 mRNA and
protein in patient fibroblasts. Lymphocyte counts were slightly reduced
or normal, but T cells showed a severely impaired proliferative response
to stimulation. Both patients had normal immunoglobulin levels, but
impaired T-cell responses to recall antigens despite immunization.
Further studies showed a defect in cellular store-operated calcium
entry, which is required for lymphocyte activation. Transfection of
wildtype STIM1 corrected the defect in vitro. Other clinical features
included autoimmune hemolytic anemia, muscular hypotonia, and defective
enamel dentition. The phenotype was similar to that observed in another
family with immune deficiency (612782) resulting from a mutation in the
ORAI1 gene (610277).

IMMUNODEFICIENCY 10
STIM1, IVS7AS, G-A, -1

Using whole-exome sequencing, Byun et al. (2010) identified a homozygous
splice-site mutation at the -1 position of exon 8 (1538-1G-A) in the
STIM1 gene in an HIV-seronegative Turkish child of consanguineous
parents who died at age 2 years from disseminated Kaposi sarcoma
associated with complete STIM1 deficiency (IMD10; 612783). RT-PCR
analysis of EBV-transformed B cell lines from the patient showed
significantly reduced STIM1 mRNA expression, and no STIM1 protein was
detected by Western blot analysis. Ca(2+) influx was completely
abolished in the patient's EVB-B cells, and expression of wildtype STIM1
rescued this defect.

.0003
IMMUNODEFICIENCY 10
STIM1, ARG429CYS

Fuchs et al. (2012) reported IMD10 (612783) in a 6-year-old Pakistani
girl of consanguineous parents. She experienced chronic and recurrent
pneumonia, diarrhea, and viremia due to infection with herpesviruses and
other pathogens. The patient's younger sister had a similar history and
died at age 21 months. A first cord blood transplant failed in the older
girl. Both sisters were homozygous for a C-to-T transition at nucleotide
1285 in exon 10 of the STIM1 gene, resulting in an arg429-to-cys (R429C)
substitution.

.0004
MYOPATHY, TUBULAR AGGREGATE
STIM1, ASP84GLY

In 3 affected members of a family with autosomal dominant tubular
aggregate myopathy (TAM; 160565), Bohm et al. (2013) identified a
heterozygous 251A-G transition in the STIM1 gene, resulting in an
asp84-to-gly (D84G) substitution at a highly conserved residue in the
intraluminal EF1 hand domain. The mutation, which was identified by
whole-exome sequencing, segregated with the disorder and was not found
in several large control databases. The level of STIM1 was not decreased
in patient myoblasts. In vitro functional expression assays showed that
myoblasts transfected with the mutation had significantly increased
clustering of STIM1, regardless of calcium levels, indicating that
calcium sensing in the sarcoplasmic reticulum was impaired. Studies of
D84G mutant cells showed increased higher basal calcium levels and
increased calcium influx in response to calcium depletion compared to
wildtype. These findings indicated constitutive activation of
store-operated calcium entry and a gain of function, most likely
resulting from the disruption of calcium-dependent inactivation of
STIM1. The findings suggested that altered calcium homeostasis causes
the muscle dysfunction and damage in this disorder.

.0005
MYOPATHY, TUBULAR AGGREGATE
STIM1, HIS109ASN

In affected members of a family with autosomal dominant TAM (160565),
Bohm et al. (2013) identified a heterozygous 325C-A transversion in the
STIM1 gene, resulting in a his109-to-asn (H109N) substitution at a
highly conserved residue in the intraluminal EF2 hand domain. The
mutation was not found in several large control databases. In vitro
functional expression assays showed that myoblasts transfected with the
mutation had significantly increased clustering of STIM1, regardless of
calcium levels, indicating that calcium sensing in the sarcoplasmic
reticulum was impaired.

.0006
MYOPATHY, TUBULAR AGGREGATE
STIM1, HIS109ARG

In affected members of a family with autosomal dominant TAM (160565),
Bohm et al. (2013) identified a heterozygous 326A-G transition in the
STIM1 gene, resulting in a his109-to-arg (H109R) substitution at a
highly conserved residue in the intraluminal EF2 hand domain. The
mutation was not found in several large control databases. In vitro
functional expression assays showed that myoblasts transfected with the
mutation had significantly increased clustering of STIM1, regardless of
calcium levels, indicating that calcium sensing in the sarcoplasmic
reticulum was impaired.

.0007
MYOPATHY, TUBULAR AGGREGATE
STIM1, HIS72GLN

In affected members of a family with autosomal dominant TAM (160565),
Bohm et al. (2013) identified a heterozygous 216C-G transversion in the
STIM1 gene, resulting in a his72-to-gln (H72Q) substitution at a highly
conserved residue in the intraluminal EF1 hand domain. The mutation was
not found in several large control databases. In vitro functional
expression assays showed that myoblasts transfected with the mutation
had significantly increased clustering of STIM1, regardless of calcium
levels, indicating that calcium sensing in the sarcoplasmic reticulum
was impaired.

173391	TITLE *173391 PLASMINOGEN ACTIVATOR RECEPTOR, UROKINASE-TYPE; PLAUR
;;UPA RECEPTOR; UPAR;;
CD87 ANTIGEN; CD87
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor is a key molecule in
the regulation of cell-surface plasminogen activation and, as such,
plays an important role in many normal as well as pathologic processes.

CLONING

Min et al. (1992) cloned the cDNA for Mo3, an activation antigen
expressed by human monocytes and myelomonocytic cell lines after
stimulation by a variety of agents. Mo3 expression in vivo is associated
predominantly with macrophages in inflammatory sites. It is a highly
glycosylated protein of about 50 kD in monocytes where it is anchored to
the plasma membrane by glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol linkage. The
complete coding sequence of the cDNA was found to encode 335 amino acids
including a predicted signal peptide of 22 residues and a hydrophobic
C-terminal portion. A database search revealed that Mo3 is identical to
the human receptor for the urokinase plasminogen activator (UPA, or
PLAU; 191840).

GENE FUNCTION

Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer and biochemical analysis,
Sitrin et al. (2001) demonstrated that PLAUR is directly associated with
the carbohydrate-binding domain of SELL (153240) in the membrane of
neutrophils, an association analogous to that between PLAUR and beta-2
integrins (see 600065). Spectrofluorometric analysis indicated that
PLAUR-mediated calcium mobilization is SELL dependent.

Foca et al. (2000) demonstrated that UPAR mRNA levels correlated with
the invasive potential of endometrial carcinomas and showed a 33-fold
increase in UPAR mRNA levels in advanced clinical stage endometrial
tumors compared with normal endometrial tissue. Furthermore, the
increase in UPAR mRNA levels correlated linearly with the progression of
disease stage. Memarzadeh et al. (2002) examined whether UPAR protein
expression correlated with (1) the grade and stage of endometrial cancer
and (2) recurrence and mortality rate in patients with endometrial
cancer. Their ultimate goal was to determine whether UPAR protein could
be used as a prognostic marker in patients with endometrial cancer. They
found no expression of UPAR protein in 7 patients with benign neoplasia
of the endometrium. On the other hand, UPAR protein expression highly
correlated with stage of disease in endometrial cancer. Moreover, high
UPAR expression positively correlated with grade of disease. It also
correlated positively with rate of recurrence and mortality in patients
with endometrial cancer. Memarzadeh et al. (2002) concluded that UPAR is
a useful prognostic marker for biologically aggressive forms of
endometrial cancer.

In human coronary artery vascular smooth muscle cells, UPA stimulates
cell migration via a UPAR signaling complex containing TYK2 (176941) and
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K; see 601232). Kiian et al. (2003)
showed that association of TYK2 and PI3K with active GTP-bound forms of
both RHOA (ARHA; 165390) and RAC1 (602048), but not CDC42 (116952), as
well as phosphorylation of myosin light chain (see 160781), are
downstream events required for UPA/UPAR-directed migration.

Wang et al. (2004) found that both Klf4 (602253) and Upar were
predominantly expressed in luminal surface epithelial cells of the
colonic crypt in mice. Colon cells from Klf4-null mice showed a dramatic
reduction in Upar protein compared with wildtype mice. Conversely, KLF4
expression in human colon cancer cells increased the amount of UPAR
protein and mRNA. Mobility shift experiments and chromatin
immunoprecipitation showed that KLF4 bound multiple regions of the UPAR
promoter.

Park et al. (2009) found that macrophages from Upar -/- mice had
enhanced ability to engulf wildtype neutrophils, but not Upar -/-
neutrophils. The enhanced phagocytic activity of Upar -/- macrophages
could be abrogated by incubation with soluble Upar, arg-gly-asp
peptides, or anti-integrin antibodies. Similarly, wildtype macrophages
showed increased uptake of Upar -/- neutrophils, except in the presence
of soluble Upar or anti-integrin antibodies. Incubation of either Upar
-/- neutrophils or Upar -/- macrophages, but not both, with soluble Upar
enhanced the uptake of Upar -/- neutrophils by Upar -/- macrophages.
Upar expression was reduced on the surface of apoptotic neutrophils
compared with viable neutrophils. Park et al. (2009) concluded that UPAR
is involved in the recognition and clearance of neutrophils.

- Role in Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis

Using quantitative RT-PCR with glomeruli isolated from human kidney
biopsies, Wei et al. (2008) found that expression of UPAR was low in
healthy glomeruli, but it was induced in glomeruli from individuals with
focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS; see 603278) and highly induced
in glomeruli from individuals with diabetic nephropathy. In all rat and
mouse models of proteinuria, Upar protein expression was increased in
glomerular cells, including podocytes, compared with controls.
Immunoelectron microscopy detected homogeneous distribution of Upar in
normal rat podocytes and mesangial and endothelial cells. However,
diabetic rats showed increased Upar labeling in all cells of the
glomerular tuft and increased podocyte Upar expression in basal
membranes of the foot process. Mice lacking Upar were protected from
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated proteinuria, but they developed
disease after expression of constitutively active beta-3 integrin
(ITGB3; 173470). Gene transfer studies revealed a prerequisite for Upar
expression in podocytes, but not in endothelial cells, for development
of LPS-mediated proteinuria. Upar was required to activate alpha-V
(ITGAV; 193210)/beta-3 integrin in podocytes, promoting cell motility
and activation of the small GTPases Cdc42 (116952) and Rac1 (602048).
Blockade of alpha-5/beta-3 integrin reduced podocyte motility in vitro
and lowered proteinuria in mice. Wei et al. (2008) concluded that UPAR
has a role in regulating renal permeability.

Wei et al. (2011) identified secreted PLAUR as a circulating factor
responsible for the development of FSGS. Levels of serum soluble PLAUR
were increased in two-thirds of patients with FSGS, but not in patients
with other glomerular disease. A higher serum concentration of PLAUR
before kidney transplantation was associated with an increased risk for
recurrence of FSGS after transplantation. Immunohistochemical studies on
human kidney samples derived from patients with FSGS demonstrated that
soluble PLAUR binds to and activates beta-3 integrin. In mouse models,
Plaur activated podocyte beta-3 integrin in both native and grafted
kidneys, causing foot process effacement, proteinuria, and FSGS-like
glomerulopathy. The findings suggested that renal disease only develops
when Plaur sufficiently activates podocyte beta-3-integrin. Inhibition
of PLAUR resulted in a reduction of beta-integrin activity in podocytes,
and plasmapheresis in humans reduced serum PLAUR concentrations in some
patients with increased levels. Wei et al. (2011) concluded that
pharmacologic modulation of excessive podocyte beta-3 integrin
activation may be a target for management of this form of renal disease.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Huai et al. (2006) reported the crystal structure at 1.9 angstroms of
the urokinase receptor complexed with the urokinase amino-terminal
fragment and antibody against the receptor. The 3 domains of the
urokinase receptor form a concave shape with a central cone-shaped
cavity where the urokinase fragment inserts. Huai et al. (2006)
concluded that the structure provides insight into the flexibility of
the urokinase receptor that enables its interaction with a wide variety
of ligands and a basis for the design of urokinase-urokinase receptor
antagonists.

MAPPING

By hybridization of a cDNA probe to DNAs from a panel of somatic cell
hybrids, Borglum et al. (1991, 1992) mapped the gene for the
urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor to 19q13-qter. Using RFLPs
related to the clone, they did linkage studies in 40 CEPH families and
demonstrated localization in the 19q13.1-q13.2 region. By in situ
hybridization, Vagnarelli et al. (1992) localized the PLAUR gene to
19q13.

ANIMAL MODEL

Powell et al. (2001) reported that Plaur knockout mice (Dewerchin et al.
(1996)) exhibit deficient scatter activity in the forebrain, abnormal
interneuron migration from the ganglionic eminence, and reduced
interneurons in the frontal and parietal cortex. Using immunoblots and
scatter assays, they concluded that the forebrain of Plaur knockout mice
has reduced levels of biologically active HGF (142409).

Stimulation with either gram-negative or gram-positive bacteria induces
upregulation of UPAR on monocytes and neutrophils. In general,
gram-negative bacterial stimuli require the beta-2 integrin CD11B/CD18B
for neutrophil emigration, whereas gram-positive bacteria do not.
Rijneveld et al. (2002) generated mice deficient in Upa or Upar.
Intranasal exposure to a beta-2 integrin-dependent pathogen,
Streptococcus pneumoniae, resulted in locally elevated levels of Upa in
wildtype mouse lungs. In Upar -/- mice, there was less granulocyte
accumulation but more bacteria in lungs, as well as reduced survival,
compared with wildtype mice. In contrast, Upa -/- mice manifested
increased neutrophil influx and fewer pneumococci in the lungs.
Rijneveld et al. (2002) concluded that UPAR is necessary for adequate
neutrophil recruitment into alveoli and lungs during pneumonia caused by
S. pneumoniae.

;;UPA RECEPTOR; UPAR;;
CD87 ANTIGEN; CD87
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor is a key molecule in
the regulation of cell-surface plasminogen activation and, as such,
plays an important role in many normal as well as pathologic processes.

CLONING

Min et al. (1992) cloned the cDNA for Mo3, an activation antigen
expressed by human monocytes and myelomonocytic cell lines after
stimulation by a variety of agents. Mo3 expression in vivo is associated
predominantly with macrophages in inflammatory sites. It is a highly
glycosylated protein of about 50 kD in monocytes where it is anchored to
the plasma membrane by glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol linkage. The
complete coding sequence of the cDNA was found to encode 335 amino acids
including a predicted signal peptide of 22 residues and a hydrophobic
C-terminal portion. A database search revealed that Mo3 is identical to
the human receptor for the urokinase plasminogen activator (UPA, or
PLAU; 191840).

GENE FUNCTION

Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer and biochemical analysis,
Sitrin et al. (2001) demonstrated that PLAUR is directly associated with
the carbohydrate-binding domain of SELL (153240) in the membrane of
neutrophils, an association analogous to that between PLAUR and beta-2
integrins (see 600065). Spectrofluorometric analysis indicated that
PLAUR-mediated calcium mobilization is SELL dependent.

Foca et al. (2000) demonstrated that UPAR mRNA levels correlated with
the invasive potential of endometrial carcinomas and showed a 33-fold
increase in UPAR mRNA levels in advanced clinical stage endometrial
tumors compared with normal endometrial tissue. Furthermore, the
increase in UPAR mRNA levels correlated linearly with the progression of
disease stage. Memarzadeh et al. (2002) examined whether UPAR protein
expression correlated with (1) the grade and stage of endometrial cancer
and (2) recurrence and mortality rate in patients with endometrial
cancer. Their ultimate goal was to determine whether UPAR protein could
be used as a prognostic marker in patients with endometrial cancer. They
found no expression of UPAR protein in 7 patients with benign neoplasia
of the endometrium. On the other hand, UPAR protein expression highly
correlated with stage of disease in endometrial cancer. Moreover, high
UPAR expression positively correlated with grade of disease. It also
correlated positively with rate of recurrence and mortality in patients
with endometrial cancer. Memarzadeh et al. (2002) concluded that UPAR is
a useful prognostic marker for biologically aggressive forms of
endometrial cancer.

In human coronary artery vascular smooth muscle cells, UPA stimulates
cell migration via a UPAR signaling complex containing TYK2 (176941) and
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K; see 601232). Kiian et al. (2003)
showed that association of TYK2 and PI3K with active GTP-bound forms of
both RHOA (ARHA; 165390) and RAC1 (602048), but not CDC42 (116952), as
well as phosphorylation of myosin light chain (see 160781), are
downstream events required for UPA/UPAR-directed migration.

Wang et al. (2004) found that both Klf4 (602253) and Upar were
predominantly expressed in luminal surface epithelial cells of the
colonic crypt in mice. Colon cells from Klf4-null mice showed a dramatic
reduction in Upar protein compared with wildtype mice. Conversely, KLF4
expression in human colon cancer cells increased the amount of UPAR
protein and mRNA. Mobility shift experiments and chromatin
immunoprecipitation showed that KLF4 bound multiple regions of the UPAR
promoter.

Park et al. (2009) found that macrophages from Upar -/- mice had
enhanced ability to engulf wildtype neutrophils, but not Upar -/-
neutrophils. The enhanced phagocytic activity of Upar -/- macrophages
could be abrogated by incubation with soluble Upar, arg-gly-asp
peptides, or anti-integrin antibodies. Similarly, wildtype macrophages
showed increased uptake of Upar -/- neutrophils, except in the presence
of soluble Upar or anti-integrin antibodies. Incubation of either Upar
-/- neutrophils or Upar -/- macrophages, but not both, with soluble Upar
enhanced the uptake of Upar -/- neutrophils by Upar -/- macrophages.
Upar expression was reduced on the surface of apoptotic neutrophils
compared with viable neutrophils. Park et al. (2009) concluded that UPAR
is involved in the recognition and clearance of neutrophils.

- Role in Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis

Using quantitative RT-PCR with glomeruli isolated from human kidney
biopsies, Wei et al. (2008) found that expression of UPAR was low in
healthy glomeruli, but it was induced in glomeruli from individuals with
focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS; see 603278) and highly induced
in glomeruli from individuals with diabetic nephropathy. In all rat and
mouse models of proteinuria, Upar protein expression was increased in
glomerular cells, including podocytes, compared with controls.
Immunoelectron microscopy detected homogeneous distribution of Upar in
normal rat podocytes and mesangial and endothelial cells. However,
diabetic rats showed increased Upar labeling in all cells of the
glomerular tuft and increased podocyte Upar expression in basal
membranes of the foot process. Mice lacking Upar were protected from
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated proteinuria, but they developed
disease after expression of constitutively active beta-3 integrin
(ITGB3; 173470). Gene transfer studies revealed a prerequisite for Upar
expression in podocytes, but not in endothelial cells, for development
of LPS-mediated proteinuria. Upar was required to activate alpha-V
(ITGAV; 193210)/beta-3 integrin in podocytes, promoting cell motility
and activation of the small GTPases Cdc42 (116952) and Rac1 (602048).
Blockade of alpha-5/beta-3 integrin reduced podocyte motility in vitro
and lowered proteinuria in mice. Wei et al. (2008) concluded that UPAR
has a role in regulating renal permeability.

Wei et al. (2011) identified secreted PLAUR as a circulating factor
responsible for the development of FSGS. Levels of serum soluble PLAUR
were increased in two-thirds of patients with FSGS, but not in patients
with other glomerular disease. A higher serum concentration of PLAUR
before kidney transplantation was associated with an increased risk for
recurrence of FSGS after transplantation. Immunohistochemical studies on
human kidney samples derived from patients with FSGS demonstrated that
soluble PLAUR binds to and activates beta-3 integrin. In mouse models,
Plaur activated podocyte beta-3 integrin in both native and grafted
kidneys, causing foot process effacement, proteinuria, and FSGS-like
glomerulopathy. The findings suggested that renal disease only develops
when Plaur sufficiently activates podocyte beta-3-integrin. Inhibition
of PLAUR resulted in a reduction of beta-integrin activity in podocytes,
and plasmapheresis in humans reduced serum PLAUR concentrations in some
patients with increased levels. Wei et al. (2011) concluded that
pharmacologic modulation of excessive podocyte beta-3 integrin
activation may be a target for management of this form of renal disease.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Huai et al. (2006) reported the crystal structure at 1.9 angstroms of
the urokinase receptor complexed with the urokinase amino-terminal
fragment and antibody against the receptor. The 3 domains of the
urokinase receptor form a concave shape with a central cone-shaped
cavity where the urokinase fragment inserts. Huai et al. (2006)
concluded that the structure provides insight into the flexibility of
the urokinase receptor that enables its interaction with a wide variety
of ligands and a basis for the design of urokinase-urokinase receptor
antagonists.

MAPPING

By hybridization of a cDNA probe to DNAs from a panel of somatic cell
hybrids, Borglum et al. (1991, 1992) mapped the gene for the
urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor to 19q13-qter. Using RFLPs
related to the clone, they did linkage studies in 40 CEPH families and
demonstrated localization in the 19q13.1-q13.2 region. By in situ
hybridization, Vagnarelli et al. (1992) localized the PLAUR gene to
19q13.

ANIMAL MODEL

Powell et al. (2001) reported that Plaur knockout mice (Dewerchin et al.
(1996)) exhibit deficient scatter activity in the forebrain, abnormal
interneuron migration from the ganglionic eminence, and reduced
interneurons in the frontal and parietal cortex. Using immunoblots and
scatter assays, they concluded that the forebrain of Plaur knockout mice
has reduced levels of biologically active HGF (142409).

Stimulation with either gram-negative or gram-positive bacteria induces
upregulation of UPAR on monocytes and neutrophils. In general,
gram-negative bacterial stimuli require the beta-2 integrin CD11B/CD18B
for neutrophil emigration, whereas gram-positive bacteria do not.
Rijneveld et al. (2002) generated mice deficient in Upa or Upar.
Intranasal exposure to a beta-2 integrin-dependent pathogen,
Streptococcus pneumoniae, resulted in locally elevated levels of Upa in
wildtype mouse lungs. In Upar -/- mice, there was less granulocyte
accumulation but more bacteria in lungs, as well as reduced survival,
compared with wildtype mice. In contrast, Upa -/- mice manifested
increased neutrophil influx and fewer pneumococci in the lungs.
Rijneveld et al. (2002) concluded that UPAR is necessary for adequate
neutrophil recruitment into alveoli and lungs during pneumonia caused by
S. pneumoniae.
