DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Monocyte chemotactic protein-1, a member of the small inducible gene
(SIG) family, plays a role in the recruitment of monocytes to sites of
injury and infection.

CLONING

Yoshimura et al. (1989) isolated a full-length cDNA clone of the MCP1
gene. Southern blot analysis showed that it is present as a single gene
in the genome and is conserved in several primates. MCP1 mRNA was
induced in human peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes by
phytohemagglutinin (PHA), lipopolysaccharide, and interleukin-1 (see
147760), but not by IL2 (147680), TNF (191160), or IFN-gamma (147570).
Sequence similarity suggested that MCP1 may be the human homolog of the
mouse competence gene JE.

Furutani et al. (1989) isolated and sequenced cDNA clones having the
identical nucleotide sequence and encoding a gene that they designated
human monocyte chemotactic and activating factor (MCAF). The amino acid
sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence showed the primary
structure of the MCAF precursor to be composed of a putative signal
peptide sequence of 23 amino acid residues and a mature MCAF sequence of
76 amino acid residues. Robinson et al. (1989) reported the complete
amino acid sequence of a monocyte chemotactic factor derived from a
human glioma and called GDCF-2. The amino acid composition of this
protein is the same as that of lymphocyte-derived chemotactic factor
(LDCF), which is thought to account for monocyte accumulation in
cellular immune reactions. The authors used Edman degradation and mass
spectrometry to demonstrate that GDCF-2 consists of 76 amino acid
residues, including 4 half-cysteines at positions 11, 12, 36, and 52.

MAPPING

By analysis of a panel of somatic cell hybrids, Mehrabian et al. (1991)
localized the gene for monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (CCL2) to
chromosome 17. By in situ hybridization, they localized the gene to
17q11.2-q21.1. By a combination of in situ hybridization and a study of
somatic cell hybrids, Rollins et al. (1991) assigned the gene to
17q11.2-q12. They pointed out that CCL2 belongs to a family of cytokines
which can be grouped into 2 subfamilies based on structure and
chromosomal location, namely 17q and 4q. The cytokines on 4q are IL8
(146930), MGSA (155730), and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (see
139110) (Wolpe et al., 1989).

GENE FUNCTION

Using flow cytometry, Corrigall et al. (2001) detected expression of a
functional IL2 receptor of intermediate affinity composed solely of
IL2RB (146710) and IL2RG (308380) on fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS)
obtained from rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis patients. Addition
of recombinant IL2, IL1B (147720), or TNFA independently did not
upregulate expression of the receptors on FLS, but IL2 or IL1B did
significantly increase expression of intracellular
tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins and the production of MCP1. Corrigall
et al. (2001) proposed that MCP1 in the synovial membrane serves to
recruit macrophages and perpetuate inflammation in the joints of
patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

Aljada et al. (2001) investigated whether insulin (176730) inhibits the
proinflammatory chemokine MCP1, which attracts leukocytes to inflamed
sites and is regulated by NF-kappa-B (see 164011). Insulin was incubated
with cultured human aortic endothelial cells at 0, 100, and 1,000
microU/mL. Intranuclear NF-kappa-B binding activity was suppressed by
approximately 45% at 100 microU/mL and by 60% at 1,000 microU/mL. MCP1
mRNA expression was also suppressed by 47% at 100 microU/mL and by 79%
at 1,000 microU/mL. The authors concluded that insulin at
physiologically relevant concentrations exerts an inhibitory effect on
the cardinal proinflammatory transcription factor NF-kappa-B and the
proinflammatory chemokine MCP1; these effects suggest an
antiinflammatory and potential antiatherogenic effect of insulin.

Sartipy and Loskutoff (2003) showed that insulin induces substantial
expression and secretion of MCP1 both in vitro in insulin-resistant
adipocytes and in vivo in insulin-resistant obese mice (ob/ob). Thus,
MCP1 resembles other genes that remain sensitive to insulin in
insulin-resistant states (e.g., PAI1, 173360). The hyperinsulinemia that
frequently accompanies obesity and insulin resistance may therefore
contribute to the altered expression of these and other genes in insulin
target tissues. These and other results suggested that elevated MCP1 may
induce adipocyte dedifferentiation and contribute to pathologic states
associated with hyperinsulinemia and obesity, including type II diabetes
(125853).

Kanda et al. (2006) found increased abundance of Mcp1 mRNA in adipose
tissue and Mcp1 protein in plasma in genetically obese diabetic (db/db)
mice and in wildtype mice with obesity induced by a high-fat diet.
Insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, and macrophage accumulation in
adipose tissue induced by a high-fat diet were reduced extensively in
Mcp1 -/- mice compared with wildtype animals. Acute expression of a
dominant-negative mutant of Mcp1 ameliorated insulin resistance in db/db
mice and in wildtype mice fed a high-fat diet.

In a study of chemokine expression in fibroblasts from patients with
systemic sclerosis (181750) and controls, Galindo et al. (2001) found
that systemic sclerosis fibroblasts displayed increased constitutive
expression of MCP1 mRNA and protein and showed a blunted response to
oxidative stress. In systemic sclerosis skin sections, MCP1 expression
was detected in fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and mononuclear cells,
whereas it was undetectable in normal skin.

Using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry studies for MCP1 on
skin biopsy specimens, Distler et al. (2001) found that MCP1 was
expressed by fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and perivascular infiltrates
throughout the skin, in involved as well as uninvolved areas, from 10 of
11 systemic sclerosis patients, whereas no expression of MCP1 was found
in healthy controls. Stimulation with platelet-derived growth factor
(PDGF; see 173430) resulted in a significant increase in MCP1 mRNA and
protein. The chemotactic activity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells
in systemic sclerosis fibroblast supernatants decreased when
MCP1-blocking antibodies were added. No effect of recombinant MCP1 on
the synthesis of type I collagen (see 120150) was observed. Distler et
al. (2001) suggested that MCP1 may contribute to the initiation of
inflammatory infiltrates in systemic sclerosis, possibly in response to
stimulation by PDGF.

Qian et al. (2011) defined the origin of metastasis-associated
macrophages by showing that Gr1-positive inflammatory monocytes are
preferentially recruited to pulmonary metastases but not to primary
mammary tumors in mice. This process also occurs for human inflammatory
monocytes in pulmonary metastases of human breast cancer cells. The
recruitment of these inflammatory monocytes, which express CCR2
(601267), the receptor for chemokine CCL2, as well as the subsequent
recruitment of metastasis-associated macrophages and their interaction
with metastasizing tumor cells, is dependent on CCL2 synthesized by both
the tumor and the stroma. Inhibition of CCL2-CCR2 signaling blocked the
recruitment of inflammatory monocytes, inhibited metastasis in vivo, and
prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing mice. Depletion of tumor
cell-derived CCL2 also inhibited metastatic seeding. Inflammatory
monocytes promote the extravasation of tumor cells in a process that
requires monocyte-derived vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF;
192240). CCL2 expression and macrophage infiltration are correlated with
poor prognosis and metastatic disease in human breast cancer. Qian et
al. (2011) suggested that their data provide the mechanistic link
between these 2 clinical associations.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Modi et al. (2003) identified 3 SNPs that formed a 31-kb haplotype (H7;
see 158105.0001) spanning the CCL2-CCL7 (158106)-CCL11 (601156) gene
cluster on chromosome 17q. The SNPs and the H7 haplotype were
significantly associated with protection from HIV-1 infection (see
609423).

Spina bifida (182940) is one of the most common congenital
malformations. Early first trimester hyperthermia, caused by
infection/fever or use of hot tubs/saunas, is associated with a 2-fold
increase in the risk of spina bifida (see Chambers et al., 1998). This
suggests that processes related to inflammation and elevated body
temperature, in particular signaling by molecules such as chemokines,
may be involved in the etiology of spina bifida. A polymorphism,
A(-2518)G (158105.0003), in the CCL2 gene differentially controls the
level of MCP1 protein that monocytes export following treatment with
interleukin-1-beta (147720) in vitro (Rovin et al., 1999). Cells with
the homozygous AA genotype produce significantly less MCP1 than do cells
with either the AG or GG genotype (Rovin et al., 1999). Furthermore,
genotype for the A(-2518)G polymorphism is associated with severity of
coronary artery disease (CAD) in those with established CAD (Szalai et
al., 2001) and the progression to CAD in patients with HIV
(Alonso-Villaverde et al., 2004). Jensen et al. (2006) hypothesized,
therefore, that the CCL2 A(-2518)G promoter polymorphism would be a
maternal genetic risk factor for spina bifida and, specifically, that
the maternal homozygous AA genotype, by mounting a less vigorous
systemic and/or local response to infection, would confer excess risk.
They tested the hypothesis in 469 families in which at least 1 member
had spina bifida. Their finding that the maternal genotype for the CCL2
A(-2518)G polymorphism is associated with spina bifida was the first
involving an immune/inflammation related gene.

Flores-Villanueva et al. (2005) found an increased risk of developing
tuberculosis (TB; see 607948) in Mexicans and Koreans heterozygous or
homozygous for MCP1 -2518G (dbSNP rs1024611) compared with those
homozygous for -2518A. ELISA analysis showed that TB patients homozygous
for -2518G had the highest plasma levels of MCP1 and the lowest plasma
levels of IL12p40 (IL12B; 161561), and these values were negatively
correlated. Stimulation of monocytes from healthy -2518G homozygotes
with M. tuberculosis antigens also yielded higher MCP1 and lower IL12p40
compared with healthy -2518A homozygotes. Addition of anti-MCP1
increased IL12 production by -2518G homozygotes, whereas addition of
MCP1 reduced IL12 production by -2518A homozygotes. Flores-Villanueva et
al. (2005) concluded that those with the MCP1 -2518GG genotype produce
high concentration of MCP1, which inhibits IL12p40 production in
response to M. tuberculosis and increases the likelihood of TB infection
progressing to active disease.

The results of Thye et al. (2009) did not support an association of MCP1
-12581 with TB.

ANIMAL MODEL

Lu et al. (1998) generated mice with targeted disruption of the MCP1
gene. Despite normal numbers of circulating leukocytes and resident
macrophages, Mcp1 -/- mice were specifically unable to recruit monocytes
72 hours after intraperitoneal thioglycollate administration. Similarly,
accumulation of F4/80+ monocytes in delayed-type hypersensitivity
lesions was impaired, although the swelling response was normal.
Development of secondary pulmonary granulomata in response to
Schistosoma mansoni eggs was blunted in Mcp1 -/- mice, as was expression
of IL4 (147780), IL5 (147850), and interferon-gamma in splenocytes. In
contrast, Mcp1 -/- mice were indistinguishable from wildtype mice in
their ability to clear Mycobacterium tuberculosis. These data indicated
that MCP1 is uniquely essential for monocyte recruitment in several
inflammatory models in vivo and influences expression of cytokines
related to T helper responses.

Recruitment of blood monocytes into the arterial subendothelium is one
of the earliest steps in atherogenesis. MCP1, a CC chemokine, is one
likely signal involved in this process. To test the role of MCP1 in
atherogenesis, Gu et al. (1998) generated low density lipoprotein (LDL)
receptor-deficient mice that were also deficient for Mcp1 and fed them a
high cholesterol diet. Despite having the same amount of total and
fractionated serum cholesterol as LDL receptor-deficient mice with
wildtype Mcp1 alleles, LDL receptor/Mcp1-deficient mice had 83% less
lipid deposition throughout their aortas. Consistent with the monocyte
chemoattractant properties of MCP1, compound-deficient mice also had
fewer macrophages in their aortic walls. Thus, MCP1 plays a unique and
crucial role in the initiation of atherosclerosis. Comparable findings
were reported by Gosling et al. (1999), who reported that absence of the
Mcp1 gene in transgenic mice overexpressing human apolipoprotein B
provided dramatic protection from macrophage recruitment and
atherosclerotic lesion formation, without altering lipoprotein
metabolism.

Gu et al. (2000) demonstrated that Mcp1-deficient mice were unable to
mount type 2 helper cell (TH2) responses. Lymph node cells from
immunized Mcp1 -/- mice synthesized extremely low levels of
interleukin-4, interleukin-5, and interleukin-10 (124092) but normal
amounts of interferon-gamma and interleukin-2. Consequently, these mice
did not accomplish the immunoglobulin subclass switch that is
characteristic of TH2 responses and were resistant to Leishmania major.
The observed effects were direct rather than due to abnormal cell
migration, because the trafficking of naive T cells is undisturbed in
Mcp1 -/- mice despite the presence of Mcp1-expressing cells in secondary
lymphoid organs of wildtype mice. Gu et al. (2000) concluded that MCP1
influences both innate immunity, through effects on monocytes, and
adaptive immunity, through control of T helper cell polarization.

Ambati et al. (2003) found that mice lacking either Mcp1 or its
receptor, Ccr2 (601267), developed cardinal features of age-related
macular degeneration (ARMD; see, e.g., 153800), including accumulation
of lipofuscin in, and drusen beneath, the retinal pigmented epithelium
(RPE), photoreceptor atrophy, and choroidal neovascularization. In
addition there was an age-related accumulation of complement components
and IgG in the RPE of the knockout mice, perhaps reflecting dysfunction
in macrophage recruitment.

Zhou et al. (2006) showed in vitro that MCP1 binding to CCR2 induced a
transcription factor ZC3H12A (610562) that is involved in apoptosis. In
transgenic mice expressing MCP1 in cardiomyocytes, which is a model of
heart failure following cardiac inflammation, they found increased
ZC3H12A expression, increased cell death, and accumulation of ZC3H12A
protein in myocardial vacuoles, characteristic of both human and mouse
heart failure.

CCL2, -2136A-T

Modi et al. (2003) genotyped 9 SNPs spanning the CCL2-CCL7
(158106)-CCL11 (601156) gene cluster on chromosome 17q in more than
3,000 DNA samples from 5 AIDS cohorts (see 609423). Extensive linkage
disequilibrium was observed, particularly for 3 SNPs, -2136T in the CCL2
promoter, 767G in intron 1 of the CCL2 gene (158105.0002), and -1385A in
the CCL11 promoter (601156.0001), that formed a 31-kb haplotype (H7)
containing the 3 genes. The frequencies of these 3 SNPs and the H7
haplotype were significantly elevated in uninfected individuals
repeatedly exposed to HIV-1 through high-risk sexual behavior or
contaminated blood products. Since these chemokines do not bind the
primary HIV-1 coreceptors CCR5 (601373) or CXCR4 (162643), Modi et al.
(2003) proposed that the influence of the H7 haplotype on HIV-1
transmission may result from activation of the immune system rather than
receptor blockage.

CCL2, -2518A-G

Jensen et al. (2006) related maternal homozygosity for the A allele of
the A(-2518)G promoter polymorphism of the CCL2 gene (dbSNP rs1024611)
to susceptibility to spina bifida (182940). The investigation was
initiated because of the relationship between maternal inflammation and
elevated body temperature to the development of spina bifida. The same
polymorphism had been associated with the severity of coronary artery
disease in patients with established CAD (Szalai et al., 2001) and a
progression to CAD in HIV patients (Alonso-Villaverde et al., 2004).

Flores-Villanueva et al. (2005) found that Mexicans heterozygous or
homozygous for -2518G had a 2.3- and 5.4-fold increased risk of
developing active pulmonary tuberculosis (607948), respectively. Among
Korean patients, the increased risk was 2.8- and 6.9-fold higher,
respectively.

Thye et al. (2009) determined the -2518 genotype and additional MCP1
variants in more than 2,000 cases with pulmonary TB and more than 2,300
healthy controls and 332 affected nuclear families from Ghana, West
Africa, and more than 1,400 TB patients and more than 1,500 controls
from Russia. In contrast to the report of Flores-Villanueva et al.
(2005), MCP1 -2518G was significantly associated with resistance to TB
in cases versus controls (odds ratio (OR) 0.81, corrected P value
(Pcorr) = 0.0012) and nuclear families (OR 0.72, Pcorr = 0.04) and not
with disease susceptibility, whereas in the Russian sample no evidence
of association was found (P = 0.86). These and other results did not
support an association of MCP1 -2518 with TB. In the Ghanaian
population, 8 additional MCP1 polymorphisms were genotyped. MCP1 -362C
was associated with resistance to TB in the case-control collection (OR
0.83, Pcorr = 0.00017) and in the affected families (OR 0.7, Pcorr =
0.004). Linkage disequilibrium (LD) and logistic regression analyses
indicated that, in Ghanaians, the effect was due exclusively to the MCP1
-362 variant, whereas the effect of -2518 may in part be explained by
its LD with -362.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The NTKR1 gene encodes the neurotrophic tyrosine kinase-1 receptor and
belongs to a family of nerve growth factor receptors whose ligands
include neurotrophins. Neurotrophins and their receptors play an
important role in regulating development of both the central and the
peripheral nervous systems. Bothwell (1996), Carter and Lewin (1997),
and Bibel and Barde (2000) reviewed neurotrophins and their receptors.
Nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR; 162010) is also referred to as
p75(NTR) due to its molecular mass and its ability to bind at low
affinity not only NGF (see 162020, 162030), but also other
neurotrophins, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF;
113505), neurotrophin-3 (NTF3; 162660), and neurotrophin-4 (NTF4;
162662). Higher affinity binding of NGFR can achieved by association
with higher molecular mass, low-affinity neurotrophin receptors, namely
the tropomyosin receptor kinases, TRKA (NTRK1), TRKB (NTRK2; 600456),
and TRKC (NTRK3; 191316). TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC are specific for or
'preferred by' NGF, NTF4 and BDNF, and NTF3, respectively (Ip et al.,
1993). NTF3 also binds to TRKA and TRKB, but with significantly lower
affinity.

CLONING

Mardy et al. (1999) reported cloning of the full-length human TRKA gene,
which was predicted to encode a 790- or 796-residue protein with a
single transmembrane domain. The extracellular domain is important for
specific NGF binding and contains 2 immunoglobulin-like domains. The
intracellular domain contains a juxtamembrane region, a tyrosine kinase
domain, and a short C terminal tail.

- NTRK1/TPM3 Fusion Gene

Martin-Zanca et al. (1986, 1986) identified a biologically active cDNA
of a transforming gene in a human colon carcinoma cell line. The gene,
referred to as the TRK protooncogene, is a chimera containing sequences
of both tropomyosin-3 (TPM3; 191030) and a tyrosine kinase. The TRK
protooncogene was predicted to encode a 641-amino acid transmembrane
tyrosine kinase expressed in neural tissues. The protein was identified
by its ability to transform rodent cells in gene transfer assays.
Martin-Zanca et al. (1986) suggested that the chimeric gene was likely
formed by a somatic rearrangement between the 2 genes, resulting in the
replacement of the extracellular domain of a putative transmembrane
receptor with the first 221 amino acids of the tropomyosin-3 molecule.

Mitra et al. (1987) expressed the entire coding sequence of the TRK
oncogene in E. coli. Antisera raised against these bacteria-synthesized
TRK polypeptides were used to identify the gene product of the TRK
oncogene as a 70-kD protein.

GENE STRUCTURE

Greco et al. (1996) determined that the human NTRK1 gene contains 17
exons spanning 25 kb of DNA, of which exon 9 is alternatively spliced.
The 5-prime untranslated region lacks a TATA box but has putative
binding sites for the transcription factors Sp1 (189906), AP1 (165160),
AP2 (107580), AP3, ATF (123803), and GCF (189901).

MAPPING

Miozzo et al. (1990) mapped the TRK protooncogene to chromosome 1q32-q41
by means of Southern analysis of a panel of human-rodent somatic cell
hybrids and subsequent in situ hybridization of human metaphase
chromosomes. Morris et al. (1991) localized the TRK oncogene to a more
proximal location, 1q23-q24, by in situ hybridization.

By use of computer-assisted microscopy and a method of fluorescence in
situ hybridization involving selection of human genomic P1 clones with
large DNA inserts, Weier et al. (1995) mapped the NTRK1 gene to
1q21-q22.

GENE FUNCTION

Hempstead et al. (1991) found that high affinity binding of NGF required
coexpression of the TRK gene and the low-affinity NGF receptor. NGF
stimulated phosphorylation of the TRK protein in neural cell lines and
in embryonic dorsal root ganglia. Kaplan et al. (1991) likewise
identified the TRK gene product as an NGF receptor, thus indicating that
the protein participates in the primary signal transduction mechanism of
NGF. Loeb et al. (1991) presented results indicating that TRK was
necessary for functional nerve growth factor signal transduction.
Cordon-Cardo et al. (1991) presented evidence that the product of the
TRK protooncogene was sufficient to mediate signal transduction
processes induced by nerve growth factor and neurotrophin-3. Ehrhard et
al. (1993) reported that TRK is expressed in monocytes; this finding as
well as others suggested that nerve growth factor is an immunoregulatory
cytokine acting on monocytes in addition to its neurotrophic function.

Chuang et al. (2001) demonstrated that bradykinin- or NGF-mediated
potentiation of thermal sensitivity in vivo required expression of VR1
(602076), a heat-activated ion channel on sensory neurons. Diminution of
plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol-4,5,bisphosphate levels through
antibody sequestration or PLC-mediated hydrolysis mimicked the
potentiating effects of bradykinin or NGF at the cellular level.
Moreover, recruitment of PLC-gamma (172420) to TRK-alpha was essential
for NGF-mediated potentiation of channel activity, and biochemical
studies suggested that VR1 associates with this complex. Chuang et al.
(2001) concluded that their studies delineated a biochemical mechanism
through which bradykinin and NGF produce hypersensitivity and might
explain how the activation of PLC signaling systems regulates other
members of the TRP channel family.

Kuruvilla et al. (2004) found that the related neurotrophins NGF and
NT3, acting through a common TRKA receptor, were required for sequential
stages of sympathetic axon growth and innervation of target fields. Yet,
whereas NGF supported TRKA internalization and retrograde signaling from
distal axons to cell bodies to promote neuronal survival, NT3 could not.
Final target-derived NGF promoted expression of the p75 neurotrophin
receptor, in turn causing a reduction in the sensitivity of axons to
intermediate target-derived NT3. Kuruvilla et al. (2004) proposed that a
hierarchical neurotrophin signaling cascade coordinates sequential
stages of sympathetic axon growth, innervation of targets, and survival
in a manner dependent on the differential control of TRKA
internalization, trafficking, and retrograde axonal signaling.

Neurotrophins (NTFs) act as survival and differentiation factors in the
nervous system and have been detected in the developing rodent testis.
To determine whether neurotrophins could influence development and
maturation of the human fetal testis, Robinson et al. (2003) examined
the cell-specific expression and distribution of several members of the
neurotrophin family and their receptors during the second trimester,
with particular emphasis on NT4 and TRKB. They detected expression of
mRNA for nerve growth factor (NGF; 162030), NTF3 (162660) and NTF4
(162662), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; 113505), the
high-affinity receptors TRKA, TRKB (600456), and TRKC (191316), and the
low-affinity p75 receptor NGFR in the human testis between 14 and 19
weeks' gestation. NT4 mRNA and protein were predominantly localized to
the peritubular cells. These cells were also the site of expression of
p75. By contrast, NGF and NT3 were mainly expressed in Sertoli and
interstitial cells. The authors concluded that these data demonstrate
the expression of neurotrophins and their receptors in the human fetal
testis during the second trimester and indicate possible roles in the
regulation of proliferation and survival of germ cells and peritubular
cells.

Cholinergic projection neurons of the basal forebrain nucleus basalis
(NB) express NGF receptors p75(NTR) and TrkA, which promote cell
survival. These same cells undergo extensive degeneration in Alzheimer
disease (AD; 104300). Counts et al. (2004) found an approximately 50%
average reduction in TrkA levels in 4 cortical brain regions of 15
patients with AD, compared to 18 individuals with no cognitive
impairment (NCI) and 16 with mild/moderate cognitive impairment (MCI).
By contrast, cortical p75(NTR) levels were stable across the diagnostic
groups. Scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) correlated
with TrkA levels in the anterior cingulate, superior frontal, and
superior temporal cortices. Counts et al. (2004) suggested that reduced
TrkA levels may be the cause or result of abnormal NB cholinergic
function in AD.

The AML1 (RUNX1; 151385)/ETO (CBFA2T1; 133435) fusion protein results
from a t(8;21) chromosomal translocation and is a potent transcriptional
modulator associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML; 601626). Mulloy
et al. (2005) transduced CD34 (142230)-positive cells with a retrovirus
carrying the AML1/ETO fusion transcript and found that AML1/ETO
expression upregulated NTRK1. Physiologic concentrations of NGF
increased the proliferation of AML1/ETO-transduced cells. Furthermore,
NGF and IL3 (147740) synergistically promoted the expansion of
ALM1/ETO-expressing cells, but not control CD34-positive cells, in
liquid culture. Mulloy et al. (2005) examined a large number of AML bone
marrow or peripheral blood samples and found those containing the
t(8;21) translocation expressed significantly higher levels of NTRK1
mRNA than samples without the translocation. They concluded that the
NGF/NTRK1 signaling pathway may be involved in the development of AML.

Keratoconus is a common corneal dystrophy that leads to severe visual
impairment. Since NGF is involved in trophism and corneal wound healing,
Lambiase et al. (2005) investigated alterations in the NGF pathway in
keratoconus-affected corneas and found a total absence of TRKA
expression and decreased expression of NGF and p75(NTR). The absence of
TRKA expression was associated with a strong increase in expression of
the short isoforms of SP3 (601804), which is involved in gene
repression, and lack of the long SP3 isoform, which is involved in gene
activation. Furthermore, expression of short SP3 isoforms in human
corneal keratocyte primary cultures resulted in downregulation of TRKA
expression. Lambiase et al. (2005) hypothesized that an imbalance in SP
transcription factor isoforms may play a role in controlling NGF
signaling, thus contributing to the pathogenesis of keratoconus.

Mutoh et al. (2005) reported an 86-year-old Japanese man with a history
of non-Hodgkin lymphoma who developed sensory axonal neuropathy and
autonomic dysfunction. Detailed laboratory investigations identified a
paraneoplastic autoantibody to Trk. Serum from the patient inhibited
NGF-induced neurite outgrowth and Trk autophosphorylation in rat
pheochromocytoma cells, suggesting that the autoantibody was responsible
for the clinical symptoms. Treatment with intravenous human
immunoglobulin resulted in clinical improvement.

Deppmann et al. (2008) reported that developmental competition between
sympathetic neurons for survival is critically dependent on a
sensitization process initiated by target innervation and mediated by a
series of feedback loops. Target-derived NGF (see 162020) promoted
expression of its own receptor TrkA in mouse and rat neurons and
prolonged TrkA-mediated signals. NGF also controlled expression of
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; 113505) and neurotrophin-4
(NT4; 162662), which, through the receptor p75, can kill neighboring
neurons with low retrograde NGF-TrkA signaling, whereas neurons with
high NGF-TrkA signaling are protected. Perturbation of any of these
feedback loops disrupts the dynamics of competition. Deppmann et al.
(2008) suggested that 3 target-initiated events are essential for rapid
and robust competition between neurons: sensitization, paracrine
apoptotic signaling, and protection from such effects.

- NTRK1/TPM3 Fusion Gene

Coulier et al. (1989) found that the only change leading to the
transforming capacity of the TRK oncogene was replacement of the
extracellular domain of NTRK1 by sequences coding for the 221
amino-terminal residues of TPM3.

By transfection assay, Bongarzone et al. (1989) found that the TRK
oncogene was activated in tumor cells, both primary tumor and/or
metastasis, in 4 of 16 patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma
(188550).

Chromosomal rearrangements are responsible for the generation of 2
different oncogenes in papillary thyroid carcinoma: RET/PTC (164761) and
NTRK1/TPM3 (TRK). Both of these oncogenes result from the fusion of the
tyrosine kinase domain of a membrane receptor protein (RET and NTRK1,
respectively) with 5-prime unrelated sequences, yielding chimeric
proteins with ectopic, constitutive tyrosine kinase activity. Greco et
al. (1993) established that the oncogenic rearrangement of the NTRK1
gene detected in thyroid tumors involved 3 different genes: the TPM3
gene was fused to the NTRK1 tyrosine kinase domain in 3 cases; the TPR
gene (189940) was involved in 3 cases; and the TAG gene (TFG; 602498)
was involved in the rearrangement in 1 case. Greco et al. (1993) found
that the rearrangements creating all the TRK oncogenes fell within a
2.9-kb XbaI/SmaI restriction fragment of the NTRK1 gene.

In 3 of 8 papillary thyroid carcinomas, Butti et al. (1995) found that
replacement of the extracellular domain of the NTRK1 gene by sequences
coding for the 221 amino-terminal residues of the TPM3 gene was
responsible for the oncogenic NTRK1 activation. In all of them, the
illegitimate recombination involved the 611-bp NTRK1 intron placed
upstream of the transmembrane domain and the TPM3 intron located between
exons 7 and 8. Therefore, due to the displacing mechanism, all of the
TPM3/NTRK1 gene fusions encoded an invariable transcript and the same
chimeric protein of 70 kD, which was constitutively phosphorylated on
tyrosine. In 2 of the 3 tumors, the simultaneous presence of the
reciprocal products of the TPM3/NTRK1 recombination (5-prime
TPM3/3-prime NTRK1 and 5-prime NTRK1/3-prime TPM3) and the previously
demonstrated localization of both genes on 1q led Butti et al. (1995) to
suggest that an intrachromosomal inversion was responsible for their
recombination. In these recombinant regions, they found some
recombinogenic elements as well as palindromes, direct and inverted
repeats, and Alu family sequences.

Using 3-dimensional structural analysis and a protein-protein
interaction system, Wehrman et al. (2007) found no evidence of TRKA and
p75 heterodimerization. Instead, TRKA formed a crab-shaped homodimer
after interaction with NGF, and p75 existed on the cell surface as a
preformed oligomer that was not dissociated by NGF. Wehrman et al.
(2007) proposed that TRKA and NGFR do not interact directly, but that
they likely communicate through convergence of downstream signaling
pathways and/or shared adaptor molecules.

Using engineered embryonic stem cells, Nikoletopoulou et al. (2010)
demonstrated that the neurotrophin receptors TRKA and TRKC (191316)
instruct developing neurons to die, both in vitro and in vivo. By
contrast, TRKB (600456), a closely related receptor primarily expressed
in the central nervous system, does not. These results indicated that
TRKA and TRKC behave as dependence receptors, explaining why developing
sympathetic and sensory neurons become trophic factor-dependent for
survival. Nikoletopoulou et al. (2010) suggested that the expansion of
the TRK gene family that accompanied the segregation of the peripheral
from the central nervous system generated a novel mechanism of cell
number control.

- NTRK1/TFG Fusion Gene

In one papillary thyroid carcinoma tumor, Greco et al. (1995) found a
chimeric oncogene, which they designated TRKT3, in which 1,412
nucleotides of NTRK1 were fused to 598 nucleotides from the TRK-fused
gene (TFG; 602498). Greco et al. (1995) determined that the TRKT3 gene
encodes a predicted 592-amino acid chimeric protein that forms
multimeric complexes in vivo.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 7 families with congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis
(CIPA; 256800), Mardy et al. (1999) identified 11 novel mutations of the
TRKA gene: 6 missense mutations, 2 frameshift mutations, 1 nonsense
mutation, and 2 splice site mutations. Mendelian inheritance of the
mutations in this autosomal recessive disorder was confirmed in 6
families for which parent samples were available. The mutations were
distributed in an extracellular domain, involved in nerve growth factor
binding, as well as the intracellular signal transduction domain. Two
mutations were linked (on the same chromosome) to arg85 to ser
(191315.0006) and to his598 to tyr;gly607 to val (191315.0005); hence,
they probably represented double and triple mutations. Triple mutation
is rare and has been reported in Gaucher disease; see 230800.0009.
Double mutations have been reported more often, e.g., in the HEXA gene
causing Tay-Sachs disease (272800.0036), and in the LDLR gene causing
familial hypercholesterolemia (143890.0055).

Miura et al. (2000) studied the NTRK1 gene in 46 CIPA chromosomes
derived from 23 unrelated Japanese CIPA families, including 3 that had
previously been reported, and identified 11 novel mutations. Four were
missense mutations that resulted in amino acid substitutions at
positions conserved in the TRK family. Three frameshift and 3 nonsense
mutations were found. One was an intronic branch-site mutation
(191315.0007), causing aberrant splicing in vitro.

Shatzky et al. (2000) identified 2 novel mutations in the NTRK1 gene in
consanguineous Israeli-Bedouins with CIPA: a 1926insT (191315.0010) in
most of the patients of the southern Israeli-Negev, and a pro689-to-leu
mutation (191315.0011) in a different Bedouin isolate in northern
Israel.

Miura et al. (2000) reported the second case of paternal uniparental
disomy (UPD) for chromosome 1 in a male patient with congenital
insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis, who developed normally at term
and did not show overt dysmorphisms or malformations. He had only the
usual features of CIPA with a homozygous mutation (1726delC;
191315.0001) at the TRKA locus and a normal karyotype with no visible
deletions or evidence of monosomy 1. Haplotype analysis of the TRKA
locus and allelotype analyses of whole chromosome 1 revealed that the
chromosome pair was exclusively derived from his father. Nonmaternity
was excluded by analyses of autosomes other than chromosome 1. The
findings further supported the idea that there are no paternally
imprinted genes on chromosome 1 with a major effect on phenotype.

Mardy et al. (2001) introduced various CIPA-causing mutations into TRKA
cDNA and examined NGF-stimulated autophosphorylation in neuronal and
nonneuronal cells. Two mutations in the extracellular domain were
aberrantly processed and showed diminished autophosphorylation in
neuronal cells. Five mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain, including
gly571 to arg (191315.0003), were processed as wildtype TRKA but showed
significantly diminished autophosphorylation in both neuronal and
nonneuronal cells. In contrast, arg85 to ser (191315.0006) and his598 to
tyr; gly607 to val (191315.0005), detected previously as double and
triple mutations, are possibly polymorphisms in a particular ethnic
background.

Indo (2001) reviewed mutations and polymorphisms in the NTRK1 gene.
Thirty-seven different mutations had been identified.

Indo et al. (2001) reported 8 novel mutations in the TRKA gene in
patients with CIPA, detected in either homozygous or heterozygous state
in 9 families from 5 countries. In 1 family, paternal uniparental disomy
for chromosome 1 was thought to be the cause of reduction to
homozygosity of the TRKA gene mutation. A Hispanic patient from the
United States had 2 autosomal genetic disorders, CIPA and pyruvate
kinase (PK) deficiency (266200), whose genetic loci map to a closely
linked chromosomal region. A splice mutation and a missense mutation
were detected in the TRKA and PKLR (609712) genes, respectively, from
the homozygous proband. Thus, concordant occurrence of 2 disorders was
ascribed to a combination of 2 separate mutant genes, not to a
contiguous gene syndrome.

ANIMAL MODEL

Smeyne et al. (1994) found that mice lacking the gene for Trka shared
dramatic features of congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis
(CIPA; 256800), including loss of responses to painful stimuli, although
anhidrosis is not apparent in the animals. This prompted Indo et al.
(1996) to consider the human TRKA homolog as a candidate for the CIPA
gene. In 3 unrelated CIPA patients who had consanguineous parents, they
detected a deletion (191315.0001), a splice site aberration
(191315.0002), and a missense mutation (191315.0003) in the tyrosine
kinase domain of the TRKA gene. The findings suggested to Indo et al.
(1996) that the NGF-TRKA system has a crucial role in the development
and function of the nociceptive reception system as well as
establishment of thermoregulation via sweating in humans.

Ugolini et al. (2007) found that MNAC13, an anti-TrkA antibody with
known neutralizing properties, induced analgesia in mouse models of both
acute inflammatory and chronic neuropathic pain. Treatment with MNAC13
resulted in a long-lasting effect in the neuropathic model and resulted
in significant functional recovery in mice with sciatic nerve ligation.
Moreover, treatment with MNAC13 potentiated the analgesic effects of
subthreshold doses of opiates.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
INSENSITIVITY TO PAIN, CONGENITAL, WITH ANHIDROSIS
NTRK1, 1-BP DEL, 1726C

In a patient with congenital insensitivity to pain (256800), Indo et al.
(1996) found deletion of a single base C at nucleotide 1726 in exon C of
the NTRK1 gene. The deletion occurred in a region encoding the tyrosine
kinase domain, causing a frameshift and premature termination codons
downstream. The proband and her parents were homozygous and heterozygous
for the deletion, respectively. In a note added in proof, Indo et al.
(1996) indicated that they had discovered another patient homozygous for
the same single-base deletion in exon C.

Miura et al. (2000) found that the 1726delC mutation was present in 20
of 40 CIPA chromosomes studied. In 6 families, the mutation was
homozygous in affected individuals; in 8 families it was heterozygous.

The 1726delC mutation causes a frameshift and premature termination
codon after amino acid arg548 in exon 14. In the case of paternal
uniparental isodisomy for chromosome 1 reported by Miura et al. (2000),
the father was heterozygous for the mutation, and the mother was
homozygous for the wildtype allele. The mutation was on the chromosome 1
derived from the paternal grandmother. Neither maternal grandparent
carried the mutation.

.0002
INSENSITIVITY TO PAIN, CONGENITAL, WITH ANHIDROSIS
NTRK1, IVSDS, A-C, +3

In 2 Ecuadorian brothers with congenital insensitivity to pain with
anhidrosis (GM08382 and GM08383) (256800), Indo et al. (1996) found a
deletion of exon D (nucleotides 1872-2112) on 1 allele of the NTRK1
gene. Part of the same exon (nucleotides 1966-2112) was deleted on the
other allele, indicating the presence of RNA splicing errors. The
partial exon deletion was apparently due to activation of a cryptic
splice donor site. Sequencing of genomic DNA revealed that the 5-prime
splice site of an intron between exons D and E contained an A-to-C
transversion in the third position. Such mutations are known to result
in skipping of the preceding exon. No substitution was found in exon D
and the flanking exon/intron junctions. Restriction digestion analysis
demonstrated that GM08382 and GM08383 (identification numbers for cell
lines in the NIGMS cell bank) were homozygous for the A-to-C
transversion and that the parents were heterozygous.

.0003
INSENSITIVITY TO PAIN, CONGENITAL, WITH ANHIDROSIS
NTRK1, GLY571ARG

In a patient with congenital insensitivity to pain and anhidrosis
(256800), Indo et al. (1996) found a G-to-C transversion at nucleotide
1795 in exon C which caused a gly571-to-arg substitution. The patient
and parents were homozygous and heterozygous for this mutation,
respectively. The investigators noted that gly571 is located in the
tyrosine kinase domain and is conserved among 14 receptor tyrosine
kinases, including human TRKB (600456) and TRKC (191316), suggesting
that it is important for enzyme activity.

.0004
INSENSITIVITY TO PAIN, CONGENITAL, WITH ANHIDROSIS
NTRK1, ARG774PRO

In an Italian patient with congenital insensitivity to pain and
anhidrosis (256800), Greco et al. (1999) identified homozygosity for a
G-to-C transversion at nucleotide 2405 in exon 17, predicting an
arg774-to-pro substitution. Other members of the family were
heterozygous; indeed, the arg774-to-pro mutation was present in both
maternal grandparents, who had no documented consanguinity but were from
the same village. Biologic and biochemical studies were consistent with
a loss-of-function effect.

.0005
INSENSITIVITY TO PAIN, CONGENITAL, WITH ANHIDROSIS
NTRK1, GLN9TER, HIS598TYR, AND GLY607VAL

In an Italian patient with congenital insensitivity to pain with
anhidrosis (256800), Mardy et al. (1999) found homozygosity for a triple
mutation in exons 1 and 15 in the NTRK1 gene, leading to 1 nonsense
mutation (gln9 to ter) and 2 missense mutations (his598 to tyr; gly607
to val). Mardy et al. (1999) suggested that the gln9-to-ter mutation was
the most likely cause of CIPA in this family. The missense mutations
were later determined to have no effect on autophosphorylation of NTRK1
(Mardy et al., 2001), and are thus likely to be polymorphisms in this
population.

.0006
INSENSITIVITY TO PAIN, CONGENITAL, WITH ANHIDROSIS
NTRK1, IVS4, G-C, -1 AND ARG85SER

In a male patient with CIPA (256800) from the United Arab Emirates,
Mardy et al. (1999) found homozygosity for a double mutation in the
NTRK1 gene: a G-to-C transversion in the first position of exon 4
(IVS4-1G-C), and a C-to-A transversion at nucleotide 337 in exon 2
causing an arg85-to-ser substitution. The latter mutation was later
determined to have no effect on autophosphorylation of NTRK1 (Mardy et
al., 2001), and is thus likely to be a polymorphism in this population.

INSENSITIVITY TO PAIN, CONGENITAL, WITH ANHIDROSIS
NTRK1, IVS7AS, T-A, -33

In a Japanese patient with CIPA (256800), Miura et al. (2000) identified
an intronic branch-site mutation, IVS7AS-33 T-A, causing aberrant
splicing in vitro.

THYROID CARCINOMA, FAMILIAL MEDULLARY
NTRK1, TYR604HIS

By SSCP analysis of 31 sporadic medullary thyroid carcinomas (155240),
Gimm et al. (1999) detected variants in 5 exons (exons 4 and 14-17) of
the NTRK1 gene. All variants were also present in the corresponding
germline DNA. Interestingly, the sequence variants at codon 604 (C1810T,
tyr to his) and codon 613 (G1838T, val to gly) of exon 15 always
occurred together, possibly representing linkage disequilibrium.

INSENSITIVITY TO PAIN, CONGENITAL, WITH ANHIDROSIS
NTRK1, 1-BP INS, 1926T

In patients with congenital insensitivity to pain (256800) from 16
Bedouin families from the southern Israeli-Negev, Shatzky et al. (2000)
identified a 1-bp insertion in the NTRK1 gene. The mutation was used for
prenatal diagnosis in 6 cases.

.0011
INSENSITIVITY TO PAIN, CONGENITAL, WITH ANHIDROSIS
NTRK1, PRO689LEU

In CIPA (256800) patients from an isolate of Bedouins in northern
Israel, Shatzky et al. (2000) identified a pro689-to-leu mutation in the
NTRK1 gene.

.0012
INSENSITIVITY TO PAIN, CONGENITAL, WITH ANHIDROSIS
NTRK1, TYR359CYS

Houlden et al. (2001) described a boy, from a consanguineous Pakistani
family, with recurrent pyrexial episodes from early life who sustained a
painless ankle injury and was found to have a calcaneus fracture and,
later, neuropathic joint degeneration of the tarsus. Examination
revealed distal loss of pain and temperature sensation and widespread
anhidrosis. Sural nerve biopsy demonstrated severe reduction in
small-caliber myelinated fiber density but only modest reduction in
unmyelinated axons. Houlden et al. (2001) concluded that the pathologic
findings were most consistent with hereditary sensory and autonomic
neuropathy type V (HSAN5; 608654); HSAN V is distinguished from the
usual congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA or HSAN4;
256800) by the selective loss of small myelinated fibers (Low et al.,
1978; Donaghy et al., 1987). Because the Pakistani patient was
homozygous for a tyr359-to-cys missense mutation in exon 8 of the NTRK1
gene, Houlden et al. (2001) concluded that HSAN IV and V are not
distinct disorders but different manifestations of mutations in the
NTRK1 gene.

Toscano et al. (2002) suggested that the patient reported by Houlden et
al. (2001) had HSAN4, not HSAN5, and noted that Houlden et al. (2001)
had based their diagnosis mainly on the pathologic findings.

.0013
INSENSITIVITY TO PAIN, CONGENITAL, WITH ANHIDROSIS
NTRK1, MET581VAL

In a large family with CIPA (256800) with many consanguineous marriages
from a small remote island in the southern part of Japan, Yotsumoto et
al. (1999) reported a met581-to-val (M581V) mutation, occurring within
subdomain V (beta-5 strand) of the NTRK1 tyrosine kinase domain. The
amino acid substitution resulted from an A-to-G transition at nucleotide
1825 in exon 14 of the NTRK1 gene. The 3 affected individuals were
adults and displayed milder clinical symptoms compared with other CIPA
patients, including normal temperature sensation and a relatively long
survival. Two patients were homozygous for the M581V mutation. Miranda
et al. (2002) demonstrated that the M581V mutation causes a reduction of
activity of the NTRK1 receptor in transfected COS-1 and NIH 3T3 cells.

.0014
INSENSITIVITY TO PAIN, CONGENITAL, WITH ANHIDROSIS
NTRK1, 2-BP DEL, 207TG

In 2 sibs with CIPA (256800), whose unrelated Israeli parents were of
Moroccan Jewish descent, Suriu et al. (2009) identified a homozygous
2-bp deletion (207delTG) in exon 1 of the NTRK1 gene, resulting in a
frameshift and premature termination at codon 86. Each unaffected parent
was heterozygous for the mutation. This mutation was identified in the
heterozygous state in a carrier from a second unrelated family of
Moroccan Jewish origin in which 2 individuals had CIPA and died. The
mutation was not found in 600 control chromosomes. Haplotype analysis
indicated shared markers surrounding the mutant allele. Both families
originated from Skoura, a small oasis village along the Valley of a
Thousand Kasbahs in southern Morocco. Most members of the Jewish
families residing there had immigrated to Israel in the 1950s. The
common ancestry suggested that 207delTG may be a founder mutation.

604602	TITLE *604602 RIBOSOME-RECYCLING FACTOR, MITOCHONDRIAL; MRRF
;;RRF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The termination of protein synthesis requires the action of several
auxiliary factors. In bacteria, ribosome-recycling factor (Rrf) is
essential for the release of ribosomes from the mRNA at the stop codon.
Mitochondria perform protein synthesis using a translation system that
has some features reminiscent of prokaryotic translation and other
features that are unique. By searching an EST database using the E. coli
Rrf protein sequence as the query, Zhang and Spremulli (1998) identified
human ESTs encoding mitochondrial ribosome-recycling factor (MRRF). They
assembled the complete MRRF coding sequence using ESTs. Sequence
analysis of the deduced 263-amino acid MRRF protein indicated that it is
likely localized in the mitochondria; however, MRRF does not have a
clear cleavage signal for removal of the signal peptide. Human MRRF
shares approximately 25 to 30% amino acid sequence identity with
bacterial RRFs.

GENE FUNCTION

Using in vitro assays with recombinant human proteins, Tsuboi et al.
(2009) showed that RRF interacted directly with EFG2 (GFM2; 606544) and
that both were required for ribosome dissociation from mRNA. GTP, but
not GTP hydrolysis, was also required. GTP hydrolysis by EFG2 appeared
to follow the ribosome splitting reaction and occurred on the ribosomal
large subunit. EFG2 and RRF remained on the large subunit until GTP was
hydrolyzed and prevented reassociation of subunits.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Hansen et al. (2000) assigned the MRRF
gene to chromosome 9q32-q34.1.

605424	TITLE *605424 MASTERMIND-LIKE 1; MAML1
;;MASTERMIND, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 1; MAM1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Notch receptors (see NOTCH2; 600275) are involved in cell-fate
determination in organisms as diverse as flies, frogs, and humans. The
'mastermind' gene has been identified in multiple genetic screens for
modifiers of Notch mutations in Drosophila. Using a yeast 2-hybrid
system on a HeLa cell cDNA library, Wu et al. (2000) isolated a cDNA
encoding MAML1, a human homolog of Drosophila mastermind. The MAML1 gene
encodes a 130-kD, 1,016-amino acid protein that localizes to nuclear
bodies. MAML1 shares 24% amino acid identity with Drosophila mastermind
and is identical to the KIAA0200 protein reported by Nagase et al.
(1996). Northern blot analysis detected a single 6-kb MAML1 transcript
in all tissues tested, with an additional 1-kb transcript in placenta.

GENE FUNCTION

Wu et al. (2000) found that MAML1 bound to the ankyrin repeat domain of
all 4 mammalian Notch receptors and amplified Notch-induced
transcription of HES1 (139605). They concluded that MAML1 functions as a
transcriptional coactivator for Notch signaling.

Moellering et al. (2009) reported the design of synthetic,
cell-permeable, stabilized alpha-helical peptides that target a critical
protein-protein interface in the NOTCH transactivation complex. The
authors demonstrated that direct, high-affinity binding of the
hydrocarbon-stapled peptide SAHM1 (stapled alpha-helical peptide derived
from MAML1) prevents assembly of the active transcriptional complex.
Inappropriate NOTCH activation is directly implicated in the
pathogenesis of several disease states, including T-cell acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). The treatment of leukemic cells with
SAHM1 resulted in genomewide suppression of NOTCH-activated genes.
Direct antagonism of the NOTCH transcriptional program caused potent,
NOTCH-specific antiproliferative effects in cultured cells and in a
mouse model of NOTCH1 (190198)-driven T-ALL.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1996) mapped the MAML1 gene
to chromosome 5.

ANIMAL MODEL

Maml1 -/- mice fail to thrive, exhibit severe muscular dystrophy, and
die within 10 days of birth (Shen et al., 2006). To study the
hematopoietic effects of Maml1 deficiency, Wu et al. (2007) transplanted
Maml1 -/- fetal liver cells into lethally irradiated wildtype recipient
mice. Maml1 deficiency minimally affected T-cell development, but it
eliminated development of marginal zone B cells, a phenotype similar to
that of Notch2 deficiency. Moreover, the number of marginal zone B cells
correlated with Maml1 gene dosage. Since all 3 Maml genes were expressed
in marginal zone B cells and their precursors, Wu et al. (2007)
concluded that Maml1 is specifically required for Notch2 signaling in
marginal zone B cells.

;;HNRPH1;;
HETEROGENEOUS NUCLEAR RIBONUCLEOPROTEIN H
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) constitute a set of
polypeptides that bind heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA), the
transcripts produced by RNA polymerase II (see 180660). More than 20
such proteins have been described and designated with letters from A to
U. By molecular cDNA cloning, 2-dimensional gel immunoblotting, and
amino acid microsequencing, Honore et al. (1995) identified 3
sequence-unique and distinct proteins that constitute a subfamily of
ubiquitously expressed hnRNPs. The identity between hnRNPs H and H-prime
(300610) was 96%, between H and F (601037), 78%, and between H-prime and
F, 75%.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Honore et al. (1995) mapped the
HNRNPH1 gene to chromosome 5q35.3.

GENE FUNCTION

Masuda et al. (2008) identified a key nucleotide in an intron of the
CHRNA1 gene (100690) that is part of an intronic splicing silencer (ISS)
sequence targeted by hnRNP H and suppresses inclusion of an alternative
exon in the CHRNA1 gene. Analysis of the human genome suggested that the
hnRNP H-binding motif 'UGGG' is overrepresented close to the 3-prime
ends of introns. Masuda et al. (2008) found that alternative exons of
several other genes, including GRIP1 (604597), FAS (TNFRSF6; 134637),
VPS13C (608879), and NRCAM (601581) are downregulated by hnRNP H. These
findings suggest that presence of the hnRNP H-binding motif close to the
3-prime end of an intron is an essential, and perhaps underestimated,
splicing regulator of the downstream exon.

602327	TITLE *602327 PLECKSTRIN AND SEC7 DOMAINS-CONTAINING PROTEIN; PSD
;;TYL;;
EXCHANGE FACTOR FOR ARF6; EFA6;;
EFA6A
DESCRIPTION Perletti et al. (1997) identified a novel human gene on 10q24,
contiguous to the 3-prime end of the NFKB2 gene (164012) in a
tail-to-tail arrangement. They described a cDNA of 4,307 bp, isolated
from an adult human brain cDNA library, which contains an open reading
frame encoding a putative protein of 645 amino acids with a predicted
molecular weight of 71 kD. Database homology searches indicated that the
novel gene codes for a putative protein containing 2 discrete domains
with significant homology to the Sec7 and pleckstrin-homology (PH)
domains, respectively. They used the gene symbol PSD for
'pleckstrin-Sec7 domains.' Northern blot analysis of a panel of RNAs
from normal human tissues using the PSD cDNA as probe revealed the
presence of 3 different tissue-specific transcripts of approximately
4.3, 2.3, and 1.8 kb, the longest of which was expressed only in brain.
The data suggested that the PSD gene may encode a protein related to the
protein family containing both the Sec7 in the PH domains and thought to
be involved in signaling transduction processes. Other human proteins in
the same family include cytohesin-1 (Kolanus et al., 1996) and ARNO
(602488) (Chardin et al., 1996).

Derrien et al. (2002) reported that PSD, which they called EFA6A, is 63%
identical to EFA6B (PSD4; 614442) and contains a Sec7 domain adjacent to
a PH domain, followed by a C-terminal coiled-coil motif. Northern blot
analysis showed that EFA6A expression was largely restricted to brain,
with a smaller transcript expressed in small intestine, colon, and
ovary. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated punctate cell surface
expression of ARF6 (600464) and EFA6A, like EFA6B, in transfected baby
hamster kidney cells. Both EFA6 proteins also colocalized with F-actin
(see 102610).

GENE FUNCTION

Derrien et al. (2002) found that recombinant EFA6A stimulated nucleotide
exchange on myristoylated ARF6, with only low activity on ARF1 (103180).
The C-terminal region was involved in microvilli lengthening. Derrien et
al. (2002) concluded that EFA6 family guanine exchange factors are
modular proteins that work through the coordinated action of the
catalytic Sec7 domain to promote ARF6 activation, through the PH domain
to regulate association with specific subdomains of the plasma membrane,
and through the C-terminal region to control actin cytoskeletal
reorganization.

MAPPING

Gross (2012) mapped the PSD gene to chromosome 10q24.32 based on an
alignment of the PSD sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC142689) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

147380	TITLE *147380 INHIBIN, ALPHA; INHA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Bremner (1989) stated that inhibin, a gonadal glycoprotein hormone which
regulates pituitary FSH (136530) secretion, was postulated to exist in
the 1920s and named in 1932, but 'during the next 40 years...attained
only slightly more scientific credibility than the unicorn.' Inhibin
exists in 2 forms, each of which shares the same alpha subunit and, when
covalently linked to 1 of 2 distinct subunits called beta-a (INHBA;
147290) and beta-b (INHBB; 147390), strongly inhibits pituitary FSH
secretion. On the other hand, the dimers of 2 beta subunits, termed
activin, are potent stimulators of FSH secretion and release in vitro.
These beta subunits share extensive sequence homology with transforming
growth factor-beta (190180).

CLONING

Mason et al. (1986) isolated cDNAs for the 3 inhibin subunits.

MAPPING

Barton et al. (1987, 1989) used cDNAs for the 3 inhibin subunits
isolated by Mason et al. (1986) to map cognate loci in mouse and man by
Southern blot analysis of somatic cell hybrid DNAs. These experiments
demonstrated that INHA maps to 2q33-qter, INHBA to 7p15-p13, and INHBB
to 2cen-q13. In the mouse the 2 loci that are on chromosome 2 in man
mapped to chromosome 1 and the INHBA gene mapped to mouse chromosome 13.
The region of mouse chromosome 1 that carries other genes known to have
homologs on human chromosome 2q includes the jsd (juvenile
spermatogonial depletion) locus. Adult jsd/jsd mice have elevated levels
of serum FSH in their testes and are devoid of spermatogonial cells. The
possibility that the mutation in jsd involves the INHA or INHBB gene was
investigated by Southern blotting of DNA from jsd/jsd mice and no major
deletions or rearrangements were detected (Barton et al., 1989).

GENE FUNCTION

Ramasharma and Li (1987) reported the identification and
characterization of binding sites for alpha-inhibin on human pituitary
membranes.

By S1-nuclease analysis, Meunier et al. (1988) showed that the inhibin
subunits are expressed in many extragonadal tissues as well as gonadal
tissues, suggesting diverse functions.

Inhibin is normally produced by ovarian granulosa cells. Lappohn et al.
(1989) found that inhibin is produced also by granulosa-cell tumors and
that measurement of serum inhibin levels is a useful early marker for
primary, recurrent, and residual granulosa-cell tumors. The other
clinical application that has been explored is male contraception
through FSH suppression.

Mellor et al. (1998) studied inhibin alpha-subunit gene and protein
expression in prostate cancer. The authors studied mRNA expression by in
situ hybridization and protein localization by immunohistochemistry.
They observed inhibin alpha-subunit mRNA expression and protein
localization in the epithelium of tissues from men with benign prostatic
hyperplasia, in regions of basal cell hyperplasia, and in nonmalignant
regions of tissue from men with high-grade prostate cancer. In the
malignant regions of tissue from men with high-grade prostate cancer,
expression of the inhibin alpha-subunit gene was suppressed and was not
detectable in poorly differentiated tumor cells. These results indicated
that in contrast to ovarian granulosa cell tumors, alpha-inhibin gene
expression is downregulated in poorly differentiated prostate cancer.

Schmitt et al. (2002) examined the INHA gene promoter and gene locus to
determine whether promoter hypermethylation or loss of heterozygosity
(LOH) occurred in DNA from prostate cancer. A 135-bp region of the human
promoter sequence that continued a cluster of CpG sites was analyzed for
hypermethylation. Significant (p less than 0.001) hypermethylation of
the INHA gene promoter occurred in DNA from Gleason pattern 3, 4, and 5
carcinomas compared with nonmalignant tissue samples. A subset of
carcinomas with a cribriform pattern were unmethylated. LOH at 2q32-q36,
the chromosomal region harboring the INHA gene, was observed in 42% of
prostate carcinomas. The authors concluded that these data provided the
first demonstration that promoter hypermethylation and LOH are
associated with the INHA gene and gene locus in prostate cancer.

Thirunavukarasu et al. (2001) reported that the molecular weight
patterns of INHBA and pro-alpha-C (a processed form of the free alpha
subunit) in serum during early pregnancy (less than 19 weeks' gestation)
showed peaks between 25 and 40 kD and approximately 60 kD, consistent
with the presence of known mature and larger precursor inhibin forms.
However, during late pregnancy (more than 19 weeks' gestation), an
increase in the proportion of smaller molecular weight forms (from 2 to
25%) of INHBA and pro-alpha-C of unknown structure were observed in the
less than 30-kD and less than 25-kD regions, respectively. Incubation of
iodinated 30-kD human INHBA with serum or plasma obtained from early or
late pregnancy showed no evidence of cleavage, suggesting that 30-kD
INHBA is not the cleavage precursor. The authors concluded that INHBA
and pro-alpha-C are processed in late pregnancy by more than one
mechanism to form low molecular weight circulating forms of unknown
structure.

Longui et al. (2004) investigated the INHA gene in 46 Brazilian children
with adrenocortical tumors (ADCC; 202300), 39 of whom were heterozygous
carriers of the R337H TP53 mutation (191170.0035). Six patients were
heterozygous for 3 INHA mutations: 127C-G in exon 1 and 3998G-A and
4088G-A in exon 2, leading to P43A, G227R, and A257T substitutions,
respectively. A257T is located in a conserved INHA region, highly
homologous to transforming growth factor-beta; both G227R and A257T
change polarity, and G227R also changes the pH. Longui et al. (2004)
concluded that INHA may be one of the contributing factors needed for
adrenocortical tumor formation in pediatric patients with the R337H TP53
mutation.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using embryonic stem cell technology, Matzuk et al. (1992) generated
inhibin-deficient mice, which developed sex cord stromal tumors at an
early age with nearly 100% penetrance, demonstrating that inhibin
functions in vivo as a tumor suppressor in the gonads of mice. Matzuk et
al. (1994) demonstrated that a severe wasting syndrome, which mimics the
human cancer cachexia syndrome, accompanies the development of gonadal
sex cord stromal tumors in inhibin-deficient mice. The cachectic
inhibin-deficient mice developed hepatocellular necrosis around the
central vein and parietal cell depletion and mucosal atrophy in the
glandular stomach, were anemic, and demonstrated severe weight loss.
Activins were elevated more than 10-fold in the serum. In contrast,
inhibin-deficient mice gonadectomized at an early age did not develop
this wasting syndrome; however, these mice eventually developed adrenal
cortical sex steroidogenic tumors with nearly 100% penetrance,
demonstrating that inhibin is also a tumor suppressor for the adrenal
gland.

609846	TITLE *609846 REGENERATING ISLET-DERIVED FAMILY, MEMBER 4; REG4
;;REG IV
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

From high-throughput sequence analysis of a large inflammatory bowel
disease cDNA library, Hartupee et al. (2001) identified a novel member
of the regenerating (REG) gene family, which they designated REG IV. The
REG4 gene encodes a deduced 158-amino acid protein with an N-terminal
signal peptide of 22 amino acids and a predicted molecular mass of 18.2
kD. REG4 maintains conservation of the 6 cysteine residues present in
other known members of the REG family. By Northern blot analysis of
intestinal mucosa from 12 individuals with inflammatory bowel disease,
Hartupee et al. (2001) identified a 1.1-kb REG4 transcript in all
samples. Control specimens had low but detectable expression of REG4.
REG4 expression was significantly upregulated by inflammation and tissue
injury associated with active Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis. RNA
dot-blot analysis showed that most of the tissues expressing REG4 are in
the gastrointestinal tract, i.e., colon, small intestine, stomach, and
pancreas.

Using real-time PCR, Violette et al. (2003) found higher levels of REG4
expression in normal small intestine than in normal colon, and barely
detectable REG4 expression in normal pancreas.

By in situ hybridization experiments on small intestine, Violette et al.
(2003) found that some cells in the epithelium, in crypts and villi,
express REG4. REG4 mRNA was located at the basal perinuclear zone of
goblet cells, and enteroendocrine cells were strongly stained.

GENE FUNCTION

Using Northern blot analysis, Violette et al. (2003) demonstrated high
levels of REG4 mRNA in 4 of 6 drug-resistant human colorectal cancer
cell lines, but very little or no REG4 mRNA is 2 drug-sensitive cell
lines. Furthermore, 77% (10/13) of colorectal tumors displayed a higher
level of REG4 mRNA than normal colon mucosa specimens. Real-time PCR
showed stronger expression of REG4 in 68% (16/22) of colorectal tumor
samples analyzed when compared with normal colon. The level of REG4 mRNA
varied within a range of 4 orders of magnitude between the different
tumors. Unlike REG4, 3 other REG genes (REG1A, 167700; REG1B, 167771;
REG3A, 167805) were present at low or undetectable levels in most tumor
samples. Violette et al. (2003) found no significant relationship
between the presence of REG4 transcripts or the increase in REG4
expression and the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) state of tumors or their
localization. However, most of the colorectal tumors overexpressing REG4
were mucinous tumors or neuroendocrine tumors.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hartupee et al. (2001) determined that the REG4 gene contains 6 exons
and that the exon structure is preserved among members of the REG gene
family.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Hartupee et al. (2001) mapped the REG4 gene to
chromosome 1.

NOCICEPTIN RECEPTOR; NOCIR;;

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Mollereau et al. (1994) used degenerate PCR based on sequences of known
opioid receptors to clone a novel receptor, which they termed ORL1, from
a human brainstem cDNA library. The cDNA encodes a 370-amino acid
polypeptide with general features of a G protein-coupled receptor and
highest homology with other opioid receptors and, to a lesser extent,
somatostatin receptors. The ORL1 protein is 49 to 50% identical to the
murine mu (600018), delta (165195), and kappa (165196) opioid receptors.
In situ hybridization to central nervous system tissues from mouse
revealed that the gene is expressed in many regions of the mouse brain
and spinal cord, particularly in limbic and hypothalamic structures.

Wick et al. (1995) screened a human lymphocyte library for opioid
receptors and isolated a cDNA, termed AT7-5EU, whose coding region is
identical to ORL1. This clone, however, has a different 5-prime
untranslated region, perhaps indicating a mechanism for tissue-specific
expression of this receptor. Northern blotting showed that AT7-5EU is
expressed in human lymphocyte cell lines of both B- and T-cell lineages
and is induced at least 10-fold by activation of lymphocytes with
phytohemagglutinin.

GENE FUNCTION

Mollereau et al. (1994) expressed the ORL1 cDNA in CHO cells and found
that ORL1 mediates inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by etorphine, a
universal opioid agonist.

Meunier et al. (1995) and Reinscheid et al. (1995) showed that the
17-amino acid neuropeptide nociceptin/orphanin FQ (601459) is the
natural agonist of the ORL1 receptor. Ma et al. (1997) found that the
NG108-15 neuronal cell line endogenously expresses the ORL1 receptor. In
these cells, the ORL1 receptor can be desensitized by treatment with its
ligand, nociceptin/orphanin FQ, and does not crossreact with specific
ligands of the delta opioid receptor.

Using RT-PCR analysis, Serhan et al. (2001) showed that both
polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and monocytes express ORL1. Binding
analysis determined that PMNs have a high-affinity receptor. Chemotactic
assays indicated that nociceptin induces PMN chemotaxis over a wide
concentration range without stimulating calcium mobilization or altering
calcium mobilization in response to other chemoattractants. In a mouse
air pouch model, Serhan et al. (2001) confirmed the chemoattractant
capacity of nociceptin in vivo, which could be blocked by the
administration of an aspirin-triggered lipid analog. Serhan et al.
(2001) proposed that release of nociceptin from afferent nerve fibers
may contribute to leukocyte trafficking and the recruitment of PMNs to
the site of inflammation.

To clarify possible involvement of the nociceptin receptor in the
regulation of nociception and locomotion, Noda et al. (1998) used
nociceptin receptor knockout mice and naloxone benzoylhydrazone
(NalBzoH), which was originally identified as a ligand for opioid
receptors. Experiments on cultured cells transfected with nociceptin
receptor cDNA showed that NalBzoH competed with tridiated nociceptin
binding and attenuated the nociceptin-induced inhibition of cyclic AMP
accumulation. Furthermore, behavioral studies demonstrated that NalBzoH
completely inhibited nociceptin-induced hyperalgesia and hypolocomotion.
Noda et al. (1998) concluded that NalBzoH can likely act as a potent
antagonist for the nociceptin receptor in vivo. In wildtype mice,
NalBzoH induced antinociception but did not affect locomotor activity.
In contrast, in the knockout mice, no significant changes in nociception
and locomotion were induced by NalBzoH. Noda et al. (1998) suggested
that the nociceptin system takes part in the physiologic regulation of
nociceptive thresholds but not in the basal modulation of locomotion.

In vitro, Beedle et al. (2004) showed that expression of human ORL1 with
N-type calcium channels resulted in a tonic voltage-dependent G-protein
inhibition of the calcium channel that occurred in the absence of
nociceptin, the ORL1 receptor agonist. Tonic inhibition of the current
was dependent on receptor density. The application of nociceptin further
reduced the current amplitude. Biochemical characterization showed that
N-type calcium channels and ORL1 receptors form a signaling complex
which efficiently exposes N-type channels to constitutive ORL1 receptor
activity. The findings demonstrated that some calcium channel activity
is regulated by changes in ORL1 receptor expression.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Although NOP shares high sequence similarity with classical opioid GPCR
subtypes (approximately 60%), NOP has a markedly distinct pharmacology,
featuring activation by the endogenous peptide N/OFQ (601459), and
unique selectivity for exogenous ligands. Thompson et al. (2012)
reported the crystal structure of human NOP, solved in complex with the
peptide mimetic antagonist compound-24 (C-24), revealing atomic details
of ligand-receptor recognition and selectivity. C-24 mimics the first 4
amino-terminal residues of the NOP-selective peptide antagonist UFP-101,
a close derivative of N/OFQ, and provides important clues to the binding
of these peptides. The x-ray structure also shows substantial
conformational differences in the pocket regions between NOP and the
classical opioid receptors kappa (165196) and mu (600018), and these are
probably due to a small number of residues that vary between these
receptors. The NOP-C-24 structure explains the divergent selectivity
profile of NOP and provides a structural template for the design of NOP
ligands.

602140	TITLE *602140 NADH-UBIQUINONE OXIDOREDUCTASE 1 BETA SUBCOMPLEX, 8; NDUFB8
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

See NDUFA2 (602137). By a combination of EST database searching and PCR,
Loeffen et al. (1998) isolated human cDNAs encoding NDUFB8 and 7 other
complex I subunits. The predicted 186-amino acid human protein is 85%
identical to ASHI, the bovine homolog.

MAPPING

By intron-based radiation hybrid mapping, Emahazion and Brookes (1998)
assigned the NDUFB8 gene to 10q23.2-q23.33. Dunbar et al. (1997) had
mapped the NDUFB8 gene to 12q21 by fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH). Emahazion and Brookes (1998) stated that subsequent mapping
studies with subfragments of the FISH-mapped recombinants of Dunbar et
al. (1997) suggested chimerism and confirmed that the earlier FISH data
were flawed.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The An1, An2, and An11 loci control the pigmentation of petunias by
stimulating transcription of anthocyanin genes. By Southern blot
analysis with a petunia An11 probe, followed by EST database searching
and PCR, de Vetten et al. (1997) obtained a cDNA encoding human AN11.
The deduced 342-amino acid, WD repeat-containing protein is 53%
identical to the petunia An11 protein and is conserved in worms and
yeast, which do not produce anthocyanins. Functional analysis showed
that human AN11 could partially complement a petunia An11 mutant. De
Vetten et al. (1997) concluded that An11 is involved in signal
transduction in petunias.

300083	TITLE *300083 PROTEIN KINASE, X-LINKED; PRKX
;;PROTEIN KINASE PKX1; PKX1
DESCRIPTION Klink et al. (1995) isolated a gene designated PKX1 by virtue of its
position within the candidate region for chondrodysplasia punctata in
Xp22.3. PKX1 appeared to encode a novel type of protein kinase that is
related to the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinases and
has striking homology to the DC2 protein kinase of Drosophila
melanogaster. PKX1 is part of a family of at least 4 genes or
pseudogenes, of which 3 map to the human sex chromosomes. In contrast to
all other genes from the X-specific region of Xp22.3, PKX1 has a homolog
on Yp (PRKY; 400008) rather than Yq. This suggests that the single
pericentric inversion event hypothesized to have occurred during primate
evolution is not sufficient to explain the present X/Y homology pattern
of Xp22.3. Klink et al. (1995) found that a high proportion of the
chromosomal rearrangements in Xp22.3 or Yp occurred within the PKX1
locus. This suggests that the PKX1 gene, besides harboring a previously
described hotspot for illegitimate Xp/Yp recombination, contains
additional sequences which predispose the X chromosome to breakage
events.

PRKX (formerly PKX1) is a novel serine/threonine subtype of protein
kinase that appears to encode a protein related to the catalytic subunit
of the cAMP-dependent protein kinases which are key players in the
cellular responses to the second messenger cAMP. Klink et al. (1995)
found that somatic cell hybrid analysis of PRKX under high stringency
conditions revealed at least 3 further loci closely related to this gene
in the human, constituting a small subfamily. Schiebel et al. (1997)
used FISH analysis to map the Y homolog of PRKX (PRKY) to Yp11.2 in
close proximity to AMELY (410000); the autosomal copy, a pseudogene
(PRKXP1), to 15q26; and a further X-linked pseudogene (PRKXP2) to
Xq12-q13.

Renal expression of the PRKX gene is developmentally regulated and
restricted to the ureteric bud epithelium of the fetal metanephric
kidney. Li et al. (2002) found aberrant adult kidney expression of PRKX
in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (PKD1; 601313). PRKX
kinase expression markedly activated migration of cultured renal
epithelial cells in the presence of cAMP; this effect was blocked by
cell treatment with the PKA inhibitor H89 and was not observed in
PKA-transfected cells. These and other results suggested that the PRKX
kinase may regulate epithelial morphogenesis during mammalian kidney
development.

601672	TITLE *601672 D4, ZINC, AND DOUBLE PHD FINGERS FAMILY, MEMBER 3; DPF3
;;CER-D4, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; CERD4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chestkov et al. (1996) described DPF3, which they called Cer-d4, a
conserved gene homologous to Neuro-d4 (DPF1; 601670). The human protein
is the apparent homolog of the mouse Cer-d4 protein.

Ninkina et al. (2001) isolated a cDNA encoding a truncated isoform of
mouse Dpf3, which they called Cerd4. The deduced protein contains 356
amino acids. Northern blot analysis detected multiple Cerd4 transcripts
in mouse retina, cerebellum, and testis only.

Lange et al. (2008) stated that there are 2 splice variants of DPF3.
They cloned the cDNA encoding the full-length isoform, DPF3B, from a
human heart cDNA library. The deduced 378-amino acid DPF3B protein
contains an N-terminal 2/3 domain, which includes a putative nuclear
localization signal, followed by a nuclear receptor interaction domain,
a C2H2 Kruppel-like zinc finger, and 2 C-terminal plant homeodomains
(PHDs). The deduced truncated isoform, DPF3A, contains 357 amino acids
and is identical to DPF3B through the first 290 amino acids, but it
contains only a single truncated PHD finger at its C terminus.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Zeng et al. (2010) reported the structural mechanism of acetylated
histone binding by the double PHD fingers of human DPF3B. Their
3-dimensional solution structure and biochemical analysis of DPF3B
highlighted the molecular basis of the integrated tandem PHD finger,
which acts as 1 functional unit in the sequence-specific recognition of
lys14-acetylated histone H3 (see 602810). Whereas the interaction with
H3 was promoted by acetylation at lys14, it was inhibited by methylation
at lys4, and these opposing influences were important during
transcriptional activation of the mouse Dpb3b target genes Pitx2
(601542) and Jmjd1c (604503). Zeng et al. (2010) concluded that binding
of this tandem protein module to chromatin can thus be regulated by
different histone modifications during the initiation of gene
transcription.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ninkina et al. (2001) determined that the DPF3 gene contains 12 exons
and spans over 275 kb.

MAPPING

Chestkov et al. (1996) mapped the DPF3 gene to chromosome 14q24.3-q31.1
by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

Ninkina et al. (2001) mapped the mouse Dpf3 gene to a region of
chromosome 12D3 that shares homology of synteny with human chromosome
14q24.3-q31.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TXNDC12 belongs to the thioredoxin superfamily (see TXN; 187700).
Members of this superfamily possess a thioredoxin fold with a consensus
active-site sequence (CxxC) and have roles in redox regulation, defense
against oxidative stress, refolding of disulfide-containing proteins,
and regulation of transcription factors (Liu et al., 2003).

CLONING

By searching genomic and EST databases for putative secretory proteins,
followed by RT-PCR of human liver RNA, Liu et al. (2003) cloned TXNDC12,
which they called TLP19. The transcript contains 2 putative poly(A)
signals in its 3-prime UTR. The deduced 172-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 19.2 kD. TLP19 has an N-terminal signal
peptide and a central thioredoxin-like domain containing the consensus
active-site motif. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.6-kb TLP19
transcript in all tissues examined, with highest expression in placenta
and liver. Placenta also expressed a 1.2-kb TLP19 transcript.
Epitope-tagged TLP19 was expressed in the Golgi apparatus of transiently
transfected COS-7 cells, and it was secreted into the culture medium.

Alanen et al. (2003) cloned TXNDC12, which they called ERP18, from a
liver cDNA library. They identified a putative C-terminal endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) retention signal (EDEL) within the deduced protein.
Alanen et al. (2003) also noted that the active-site motif of ERP18
(CGAC) is unlike the catalytic motifs of other thioredoxin superfamily
members, including thioredoxins, isomerases, and oxidating enzymes. The
overall structure of the ERP18 catalytic domain most strongly resembles
those of protein disulfide isomerases (PDI; see 176790). In contrast to
the findings of Liu et al. (2003), Alanen et al. (2003) found that
fluorescence-tagged ERP18 was retained in the ER of transfected COS-7
cells, and the staining did not overlap that of a Golgi marker.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

From circular dichroism and NMR measurements, Alanen et al. (2003)
determined that ERP18 undergoes only a minor conformational change upon
dithiol-disulfide exchange in the active site. Guanidinium chloride
denaturation curves indicated that the reduced form of the protein is
more stable than the oxidized form, suggesting that ERP18 is involved in
disulfide bond formation.

GENE FUNCTION

Liu et al. (2003) found that recombinant TLP19 without the signal
peptide showed reducing activity against an insulin-disulfide substrate.

Alanen et al. (2003) found that ERP18 showed significant peptide
thiol-disulfide oxidase activity in vitro, and the activity was
dependent on the presence of both active-site cysteines. The activity
differed from that of the human PDI family in that it was limited by
substrate oxidation and not by enzyme reoxidation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Liu et al. (2003) determined that the TLP19 gene contains 7 exons and
spans more than 35 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Liu et al. (2003) mapped the TLP19 gene to
chromosome 1p32.3.

601155	TITLE *601155 MINOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY ANTIGEN HA-1; HMHA1
;;HISTOCOMPATIBILITY (MINOR) HA-1;;
HLA-HA1;;
KIAA0223
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Cytotoxic T lymphocytes directed against minor histocompatibility
antigens of the host were demonstrated in blood from recipients of bone
marrow from donors who were genotypically HLA identical. Clones of such
cytotoxic T cells were isolated from lymphocyte populations in the blood
of patients with severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD; see 614395).
These clones were used as reagents to identify 5 nonsex-linked minor
histocompatibility antigens, designated HA-1, -2 (600642) , -3, -4, and
-5 by van Els et al. (1992). Most of the cytotoxic-T-cell clones
isolated from various patients reacted against HA-1 (van Els et al.,
1992). Goulmy et al. (1996) stated that for immune recognition, the
HA-1, -2, -4, and -5 antigens must be presented to cytotoxic T cells by
the major histocompatibility antigen HLA-A2. In this way, they behave
like antigens recognized in an HLA-restricted fashion. The HA-1 antigen
is present in 69% of normal people who express HLA-A2, whereas the
frequencies of the 3 others in this set of HLA-A2-restricted minor
histocompatibility antigens are either high (95% for HA-2); or low (16%
of HA-4 and 7% for HA-5). The HLA-1-restricted minor histocompatibility
antigen HA-3 occurs in 88% of persons positive for HLA-A1. HA-1, -2, -4,
and -5 are inherited independently of the HLA genes; each of them is
encoded by a single gene, and none has a locus within the HLA region
(Schreuder et al., 1993).

GENE FUNCTION

To investigate whether mismatching of minor histocompatibility antigens
contributes to acute GVHD in recipients of genotypically HLA-identical
bone marrow, Goulmy et al. (1996) studied 148 bone marrow recipients and
their sib donors. Fifty pairs were positive for HLA-A1, 117 were
positive for HLA-A2, and 19 were positive for both. The pairs were typed
with cytotoxic-T-cell clones specific for HA-1, -2, -3, -4, and -5. A
mismatch of only HA-1 was significantly correlated with GVHD of grade II
or higher in adults.

Den Haan et al. (1998) identified HA-1 as a nonapeptide derived from a
partial cDNA sequence, designated KIAA0223, derived from the acute
myelogenous leukemia KG-1. HA-1 has the amino acid sequence VLHDDLLEA,
termed HA-1(H). A single amino acid substitution of arginine for
histidine leads to HA-1-negative status, termed HA-1(R). Den Haan et al.
(1998) found that HA-1(H) is presented by its recognizing antigen,
HLA-A*0201, while HA-1(R) is not. The binding affinity of the HA-1(R)
peptide for HLA-A*0201 is 1/12 that of HA-1(H). The authors concluded
that HA-1(R) is a null allele and that only bone marrow transplantation
from an HA-1(R/R) donor to an HA-1(H/H) or HA-1(H/R) recipient, and not
the reverse, would be significantly associated with GVHD. Den Haan et
al. (1998) suggested that HA-1 typing before bone marrow transplantation
of HLA-matched donor-recipient combinations would improve bone marrow
donor selection and prediction of HA-1-induced GVHD.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kaminski et al. (2000) determined that the HA-1 gene contains 23 exons
and spans 16 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1996) mapped the KIAA0223
gene to chromosome 19. Kaminski et al. (2000) mapped the HA-1 gene to
chromosome 19p13.3 based on sequence identity shared with a BAC clone
mapped to 19p13.3.

606510	TITLE *606510 Fc RECEPTOR-LIKE PROTEIN 3; FCRL3
;;FCRH3
DESCRIPTION Receptors for the Fc region (FcRs) of immunoglobulins (Igs) modulate
cellular and humoral immunity by linking their antibody ligands with
effector cells of the immune system. FcRs sense humoral concentrations
of antibody, initiate cellular responses in host defense, and
participate in autoimmune disorders.

CLONING

By database searching using a consensus sequence corresponding to the
second Ig-like domains of FCGR1A (146760), FCGR2A (146790), and FCGR3A
(146740) as well as the third Ig-like domain of the polymeric Ig
receptor (PIGR; 173880), Davis et al. (2001) identified 2 BAC clones
located at chromosome 1q21.1-q22. They found that one of these clones
contained 3 novel putative Ig superfamily genes, which they designated
FCRH1 (606508), FCRH2 (SPAP1; 606509), and FCRH3, as well as 2
previously identified members of this family, FCRH4 (IRTA1; 605876) and
FCRH5 (IRTA2; 605877). Sequence analysis predicted that the 734-amino
acid type I transmembrane protein possesses a hydrophobic signal
peptide, 6 extracellular C2 type Ig-like domains, 7 N-linked
glycosylation sites, an uncharged transmembrane segment, and a 140-amino
acid cytoplasmic tail with 1 ITAM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based
activation motif), 1 ITIM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory
motif), and an ITAM-like region. Northern blot analysis revealed
expression of approximately 3.5-, 5.5- and 7.0-kb transcripts, chiefly
in spleen and lymph nodes but also in peripheral blood lymphocytes,
thymus, and bone marrow, and an approximately 1.35-kb transcript in
skeletal muscle. RT-PCR analysis detected expression in mature B-cell
lines. Davis et al. (2001) suggested that FCRH3 may have an
activating/inhibitory or a fine-tuning role in regulation of immunologic
function.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Davis et al. (2001) determined that the
FCRH3 gene contains 11 exons spanning approximately 28 kb.

MAPPING

By BAC and genomic sequence analysis, Davis et al. (2001) mapped the
FCRH3 gene to chromosome 1q21.2-q22, near the classic FCGR loci.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Kochi et al. (2005) concluded that FCRL3 may have a pivotal role in
autoimmunity. They identified a SNP in the promoter region of FCRL3 that
is associated with susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis (180300),
autoimmune thyroid disease (see 608173), and systemic lupus
erythematosus (152700). The polymorphism alters the binding affinity of
nuclear factor-kappa-B (see 164011) and regulates FCRL3 expression. They
observed high FCRL3 expression on B cells and augmented autoantibody
production in individuals with the disease-susceptible genotype.

By means of an association study using nonsynonymous SNPs and tag SNPs
from the major histocompatibility complex, the (Wellcome Trust Case
Control Consortium and The Australo-Anglo-American Spondylitis
Consortium, 2007) confirmed the association of autoimmune thyroid
disease with FCRL3 reported by Kochi et al. (2005).

120216	TITLE *120216 COLLAGEN, TYPE V, ALPHA-3; COL5A3
DESCRIPTION Type V collagen is distributed in vertebrate tissues as a heterotrimer
of 3 different polypeptide chains, alpha-1 (COL5A1, 120215), alpha-2
(COL5A1, 120190), and alpha-3 (COL5A3), a heterotrimer of 2 copies of
alpha-1 and 1 copy of alpha-2, or a homotrimer of alpha-1 polypeptides.
For additional background information on collagen V, see 120215.

CLONING

By database searching, screening of cDNA libraries, and nested PCR,
Imamura et al. (2000) cloned full-length human and mouse COL5A3 cDNAs
encoding 1,745- and 1,739-amino acid proteins, respectively. COL5A3 is
most similar to the fibrillar procollagens COL5A1, COL11A1 (120280), and
COL11A2 (120290). Dot-blot analysis demonstrated particularly high
levels of COL5A3 expression in mammary gland, high levels in placenta,
uterus, fetal heart and lung, and moderately high levels in adult heart
and brain. Relatively high levels of COL5A1 and COL5A2 were found in
most of the same tissues, indicating the presence of heterotrimers of
the collagen V alpha chains in these tissues. An exception was adult
brain, in which the levels of COL5A3 were not matched by those of the
other two. Northern blot analysis detected particularly high expression
of an approximately 6.0-kb transcript in heart, placenta, and uterus.
Smaller bands of approximately 4.2 kb and 5.5 kb were found in brain and
lung, respectively. In situ hybridization of mouse embryos detected
Col5a3 expression primarily in the epimysial sheaths of developing
muscles and within nascent ligaments adjacent to forming bones and in
joints.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Imamura et al. (2000) mapped the COL5A3
gene to chromosome 19p13.2. By interspecific backcross analysis, they
mapped the mouse homolog to a region of syntenic homology on proximal
chromosome 9.

602509	TITLE *602509 GOLGI AUTOANTIGEN, GOLGIN SUBFAMILY A, 4; GOLGA4
;;TRANS-GOLGI p230;;
GOLGIN 245
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

To characterize the Golgi complex, Kooy et al. (1992) used serum from a
Sjogren syndrome (270150) patient with a high titer of anti-Golgi
autoantibodies. The serum immunoprecipitated a 230-kD protein that was
specifically localized to the cytosolic surface of what was probably the
trans-face of the Golgi stack. The 230-kD Golgi protein appeared to be a
peripheral membrane component. The authors detected the 230-kD antigen
in several cell types and species. By screening a HeLa cell cDNA
expression library with the anti-Golgi autoantibodies, Erlich et al.
(1996) identified a p230 cDNA. The 7.7-kb p230 mRNA encodes a
2,230-amino acid protein with a predicted coiled-coil structure,
stabilized by heptad repeats. The p230 protein also contains a granin
motif (see 113705). By SDS-PAGE, p230 from HeLa cells migrated as a
230-kD protein.

Independently, Fritzler et al. (1995) cloned a partial GOLGA4 cDNA,
using serum from a Sjogren syndrome patient. Based on its predicted
molecular mass, they designated the GOLGA4 protein golgin-245.

GENE FUNCTION

Using live-cell imaging, Lieu et al. (2008) showed that tubules and
carriers expressing p230 selectively mediated TNF (191160) transport
from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) in HeLa cells. Lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) activation of macrophages caused a dramatic increase in
p230-labeled tubules and carriers emerging from the TGN. Depletion of
p230 in macrophages reduced cell surface delivery of TNF more than
10-fold compared with control cells. Mice with RNA interference-mediated
silencing of p230 also had dramatically reduced surface expression of
Tnf. Lieu et al. (2008) concluded that p230 is a key regulator of TNF
secretion and that LPS activation of macrophages increases Golgi
carriers for export.

GENE STRUCTURE

Daigo et al. (1999) determined that the GOLGA4 gene contains at least 11
exons.

MAPPING

By analysis of a cloned segment from 3p22-p21.3, Daigo et al. (1999)
determined that the GOLGA4 gene is located in this region.

603444	TITLE *603444 FAR UPSTREAM ELEMENT-BINDING PROTEIN 1; FUBP1
;;FAR UPSTREAM ELEMENT-BINDING PROTEIN; FUBP;;
FUSE-BINDING PROTEIN; FBP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The far upstream element (FUSE) of the human MYC (190080) protooncogene
stimulates expression in undifferentiated cells. Duncan et al. (1994)
purified a 70-kD FUSE-binding protein, or FBP, that is present in
undifferentiated but not differentiated cells. FBP exhibited DNA binding
specificity for the noncoding strand of the FUSE site in vitro. By PCR
of human cell line cDNA with degenerate primers based on a partial FBP
protein sequence, the authors isolated partial FBP cDNAs. They recovered
additional cDNAs from several libraries and used them to assemble a
full-length FBP cDNA sequence. The central region of the predicted
644-amino acid protein contains 4 copies of a repeat unit. In vitro
binding assays with mutant protein constructs indicated that the third
and fourth copies constituted the minimum single-stranded DNA-binding
domain. Using potassium permanganate to probe DNA conformation in vivo,
Duncan et al. (1994) determined that the pattern of sensitivity of
genomic DNA was consistent with the binding of FBP to the noncoding
strand of FUSE, which displaced the coding strand. Expression of FBP in
human leukemia cells stimulated the activity of a MYC promoter in a
FUSE-dependent manner. Northern blot analysis revealed that expression
of the 2.6-kb FBP mRNA declined upon differentiation, suggesting that
FUSE-binding activity may be regulated transcriptionally. In addition,
by sequence analysis of FBP cDNAs, the authors found evidence that FBP
activity may also be regulated by alternative splicing, translation
efficiency, and posttranslational modification.

GENE FUNCTION

Inherited mutations of the transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) helicase
subunits XPB (133510) or XPD (278730) yield overlapping DNA repair and
transcription syndromes. The high risk of cancer in these patients is
not fully explained by the repair defect. The transcription defect,
however, is subtle and more difficult to evaluate. Liu et al. (2001)
showed that XPB and XPD mutations block transcription activation by FBP,
a regulator of MYC expression, and block repression by the
FBP-interacting repressor (FIR; 604819). Through TFIIH, FBP facilitates
transcription until promoter escape, whereas after initiation, FIR uses
TFIIH to delay promoter escape. Mutations in TFIIH that impair
regulation by FBP and FIR affect proper regulation of MYC expression and
have implications in the development of malignancy.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Bettegowda et al. (2011) performed exonic sequencing of 7
oligodendrogliomas. Among other changes, they found that the CIC gene
(612082) (homolog of the Drosophila gene capicua) on chromosome 19q was
somatically mutated in 6 cases and that the FUBP1 gene on chromosome 1p
was somatically mutated in 2 tumors. Examination of 27 additional
oligodendrogliomas revealed 12 and 3 more tumors with mutations of CIC
and FUBP1, respectively, 58% of which were predicted to result in
truncations of the encoded proteins. Bettegowda et al. (2011) concluded
that their results suggested a critical role for these genes in the
biology and pathology of oligodendrocytes.

606935	TITLE *606935 RNA-BINDING MOTIF PROTEIN 17; RBM17
;;SPLICING FACTOR, 45-KD; SPF45
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Neubauer et al. (1998) characterized the mammalian spliceosome, a
multiprotein complex that removes introns from mRNA precursors.
Approximately half of the components excised from a 2-dimensional gel
separation of the spliceosome were found in protein sequence databases.
Using nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry, the remainder were identified
and cloned using EST databases. One of the proteins characterized was a
45-kD splicing factor that the authors termed SPF45.

GENE FUNCTION

The Drosophila 'sex-lethal' (Sxl) protein promotes skipping of exon 3
from its own pre-mRNA. An unusual sequence arrangement of 2 AG
dinucleotides and an intervening polypyrimidine (Py) tract at the
3-prime end of intron 2 is important for Sxl autoregulation. Lallena et
al. (2002) showed that U2AF (see 191317) interacts with the Py tract and
downstream AG, whereas SPF45 interacts with the upstream AG and
activates it for the second catalytic step of the splicing reaction. The
authors stated that SPF45 represents a novel class of second-step
factors, and its interaction with Sxl was found to block splicing at the
second step. These results were in contrast with other mechanisms of
splicing regulation, which target early events of spliceosome assembly.
A similar role for SPF45 was demonstrated in the activation of a cryptic
3-prime splice site generated by a common mutation in the HBB gene
(141900.0364) that causes beta-thalassemia (613985).

Lim et al. (2008) demonstrated that the expanded polyglutamine tract of
ATXN1 (601556) differentially affects the function of the host protein
in the context of different endogenous protein complexes. Polyglutamine
expansion in ATXN1 favors the formation of a particular protein complex
containing RBM17 contributing to the neuropathology of SCA1 (164400) by
means of a gain-of-function mechanism. Concomitantly, polyglutamine
expansion attenuates the formation and function of another protein
complex containing ATXN1 and capicua (612082), contributing to SCA1
through a partial loss-of-function mechanism. Lim et al. (2008)
concluded that their model provides mechanistic insight into the
molecular pathogenesis of SCA1 as well as other polyglutamine diseases.

MAPPING

The RBM17 gene is located on chromosome 10p15.1, 21 kb centromeric to
the IL2RA gene (147730) in a head-to-head orientation (Lowe et al.,
2007).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In an analysis of up to 5,312 individuals with type 1 diabetes (see
601942) and 6,855 controls, Lowe et al. (2007) localized the type 1
diabetes association in the IL2RA gene region to 2 independent groups of
SNPs, spanning overlapping regions of 14 and 40 kb, encompassing IL2RA
(147730) intron 1 and the 5-prime regions of IL2RA and flanking gene
RBM17 (odds ratio = 2.04; p = 10(-28)). The authors commented that it
was unlikely that the causal variants were located within RBM17 itself,
but stated that an effect on RBM17 due to polymorphisms in the
intergenic region affecting transcription could not be ruled out.

614997	TITLE *614997 GATA ZINC FINGER DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2A; GATAD2A
;;p66-ALPHA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

GATAD2A is a subunit of the methyl-CpG-binding protein-1 complex (MeCP1;
see 156535), which deacetylates methylated nucleosomes to repress gene
expression (summary by Brackertz et al., 2002).

CLONING

Brackertz et al. (2002) cloned GATAD2A and GATAD2B (614998), which
encode p66-alpha and p66-beta proteins, respectively. The deduced
633-amino acid p66-alpha protein contains 2 conserved regions, CR1 and
CR2. CR2 has characteristics of a GATA-type zinc finger domain.
Semiquantitative PCR detected variable expression of both p66-alpha and
p66-beta in all human tissues and cancer cell lines examined. In
transfected cells, p66-alpha and p66-beta colocalized in nuclear
speckles, and both partly colocalized with the MeCP1 complex subunit
MBD2 (603547).

GENE FUNCTION

Brackertz et al. (2002) found that expression of human p66-alpha in CV1
monkey kidney cells caused dose-dependent repression of a reporter gene.
Truncation analysis revealed several repressive domains in p66-alpha
that acted together to mediate full repressive function. Protein
pull-down experiments revealed that both p66-alpha and p66-beta
interacted with MBD2 and MBD3. Mutation analysis revealed that both CR1
and CR2 of p66-alpha and 2 domains of MBD2 were required for the
interaction.

Brackertz et al. (2006) found that, when targeted to chromatin, both
p66-alpha and p66-beta showed transcriptional repressor activity that
was independent of MBD2. MBD2 appeared to function as a scaffold
protein, targeting p66-alpha and p66-beta to chromatin. Both p66-alpha
and p66-beta also interacted with all histone tails tested, and
acetylation of histone tails interfered with p66 binding.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Brackertz et al. (2002) mapped the GATAD2A
gene to chromosome 19q13.11.

606584	TITLE *606584 PROTEIN-TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE, NONRECEPTOR-TYPE, 23; PTPN23
;;HIS-DOMAIN PROTEIN-TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE; HDPTP;;
KIAA1471
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Toyooka et al. (2000) isolated a cDNA encoding a novel protein tyrosine
phosphatase, PTPN23, from a gastric cancer cell line. The predicted
protein contains at least 1,636 amino acids and has several features
distinct from those in previously identified PTPs, the most striking of
which is the sequence VHCSSG instead of the invariant VHCSAG sequence at
the PTP active center. PTPN23 contains a zinc-hand domain, which the
authors called a 'His domain' (HD); several SH3-binding motifs; a
tyrosine phosphatase domain; a C-terminal PEST motif; and an N-terminal
domain similar to yeast BRO1, mouse rhophilin (601031), and human AIP1
(605555). It appears to be the homolog of rat PTP-TD14 which has been
found to inhibit activated H-ras-mediated cell transformation (Cao et
al., 1998). Northern blot analysis in rat revealed ubiquitous expression
of a 6-kb PTPN23 transcript. Expression experiments demonstrated that
PTPN23 is distributed within the cytoplasm.

In the RERF-LCMA small cell lung cancer cell line (see 182280), Toyooka
et al. (2000) identified a hemizygous missense mutation in the PTPN23
gene, a CCT-to-TCT change resulting in a pro1099-to-ser substitution.
The mutation causes an alteration in the structure of one of the
SH3-binding motifs within the His domain.

GENE FUNCTION

In a functional genomic screen using RNA interference, Kim et al. (2010)
identified PTPN23 as a gene involved in ciliogenesis control. Silencing
of PTPN23 greatly reduced the number of ciliated cells in functional
assays.

GENE STRUCTURE

Toyooka et al. (2000) determined that the PTPN23 gene contains at least
25 exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis and sequence analysis, Toyooka et al.
(2000) mapped the PTPN23 gene between markers WI-11814 and WI-18411 on
chromosome 3p21.3, within a putative tumor suppressor region.

146740	TITLE *146740 Fc FRAGMENT OF IgG, LOW AFFINITY IIIa, RECEPTOR FOR; FCGR3A
;;IMMUNOGLOBULIN G Fc RECEPTOR III-2;;
FCRIII-2;;
CD16A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The Fc receptor with low affinity for IgG (FCGR3, or CD16) is encoded by
2 nearly identical genes, FCGR3A and FCGR3B (610665), resulting in
tissue-specific expression of alternative membrane-anchored isoforms.
FCGR3A encodes a transmembrane protein expressed on activated
monocytes/macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, and a subset of T
cells. In contrast, FCGR3B encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol
(GPI)-anchored protein that is expressed constitutively by neutrophils
and after gamma-interferon (IFNG; 147570) stimulation by eosinophils
(summary by Gessner et al., 1995).

CLONING

By Western blot and flow cytometric analyses, Ravetch and Perussia
(1989) demonstrated differential expression of FCGR3 on
polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and NK cells. The glycoprotein on
NK cells (FCGR3A) had a molecular mass 6 to 10 kD larger than that on
neutrophils (FCGR3B) and was resistant to phosphatidylinositol-specific
phospholipase C. Transcripts derived from FCGR3A and FCGR3B in NK cells
and PMNs, respectively, have multiple single nucleotide differences,
including 1 that converts a termination codon to a codon encoding arg,
thereby extending the cytoplasmic domain by 21 amino acids and
introducing a transmembrane anchor for FCGR3A in NK cells. The deduced
FCGR3A protein contains 254 amino acids, whereas the deduced FCGR3B
protein contains 233 amino acids. Ravetch and Perussia (1989) concluded
that cell type-specific expression of 2 genes encoding alternative FCGR3
proteins has a significant effect on the biologic functions of the
molecules.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gessner et al. (1995) isolated and sequenced genomic clones of FCGR3A
and FCGR3B, located their transcription initiation sites, identified the
different organizations of their 5-prime regions, and demonstrated 4
distinct classes of FCGR3A transcripts compared with a single class of
FCGR3B transcripts. The gene promoters displayed different
tissue-specific transcriptional activities reflecting expression of
FCGR3A in NK cells and FCGR3B in neutrophils.

MAPPING

Le Coniat et al. (1990) mapped the FCGR3A gene to chromosome 1q23 by in
situ hybridization.

GENE FUNCTION

Anderson et al. (1990) concluded that CD16 is included in the zeta
natural killer cell receptor complex (CD3Z; 186780).

Some gamma-delta T cells (see TCRG, 186970 and TCRD, 186810) express
CD16. Using flow cytometric analysis, Bodman-Smith et al. (2000)
examined the relative proportions of CD16+ gamma-delta T cells in the
blood and synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis (RA; 180300) patients
and the blood of control subjects. There was a significant reduction in
CD16+ gamma-delta T cells in synovial fluid compared with the
circulation. Mitogenic stimulation of circulating gamma-delta T cells
resulted in an increased expression of the HLA-DR activation marker and
a concomitant time-dependent decrease in the expression of CD16.
Bodman-Smith et al. (2000) concluded that CD16 expression is lost in the
synovial compartment as a result of activation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

On the natural killer (NK) cells of a 3-year-old boy who suffered from
recurrent viral respiratory tract infections since birth, de Vries et
al. (1996) found an unusual CD16 phenotype. The child also had severe
clinical problems with BCG vaccination and after Epstein-Barr virus and
varicella-zoster virus infections. His peripheral blood lymphocytes
contained a normal percentage and absolute number of CD3(-)CD7(+) cells,
which were positively stained with CD16 monoclonal antibodies. FCGR3
expression on granulocytes appeared to be normal. Sequence analysis of
the FCGR3A gene, encoding CD16 on NK cells and macrophages, showed a
T-to-A nucleotide substitution at position 230 on both alleles,
predicting a leucine to histidine amino acid change at position 48
(146740.0002).

By cloning and sequencing FCGR3A cDNA from NK cells and macrophages of a
heterozygous donor, de Haas et al. (1996) identified a 230T-G SNP that
resulted in a leu48-to-arg (L48R) substitution in the first
extracellular Ig-like domain and caused a higher electrophoretic
mobility of deglycosylated FCGR3A. PCR and restriction analysis
identified a 230T-A SNP, resulting in a leu48-to-his (L48H)
substitution, in another donor. Genotype analysis revealed a gene
frequency of 86% for 230T (L48), 6% for 230G (R48), and 8% for 230A
(H48) in 93 FCGR3B-positive individuals. In contrast, the frequency of
the 230G allele was significantly higher in 12 FCGR3B-deficient donors.
The H48 and R48 variants exhibited a higher binding capacity for IgG1,
IgG3, and IgG4 than did the common L48 variant. De Haas et al. (1996)
concluded that SNPs at position 230 of FCGR3A influence IgG binding, as
well as reactivity of CD16 monoclonal antibodies.

Koene et al. (1997) used PCR-based restriction analysis to genotype 87
donors for a 559T-G SNP in FCGR3A that results in a phe158-to-val
(F158V) substitution. They found gene frequencies of 57% and 43% for
F158 and V158, respectively. F158 was linked to L48, and V158 was linked
to R48 or H48. Through functional analysis, Koene et al. (1997)
determined that the previously identified differences in IgG binding
among the 3 FCGR3A variants at position 48 are a consequence of the
linked polymorphism at position 158.

Among 1,115 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA; 180300) and 654
controls, Robinson et al. (2012) found no significant association
between FCGR3A copy number and disease.

Although nearly all adults have been exposed to herpes simplex virus
(HSV)-1, the clinical course of infection varies remarkably. By
analyzing the contribution of gene families on chromosomes 1, 6, 12, and
19 to susceptibility to HSV-1 infection in 302 individuals, Moraru et
al. (2012) identified no specific susceptibility locus. However, they
found that the risk of suffering clinical HSV-1 infection was modified
by MHC class I allotypes, HLA-C1 (142840) interaction with KIR2DL2
(604937), and the phe/val polymorphism at codon 158 of CD16A.

EVOLUTION

By determining the nature and rate of copy number variation (CNV)
mutation and investigating the global variation of disease-associated
variation at the FCGR locus, Machado et al. (2012) determined that CNV
of the FCGR3 genes is mediated by recurrent nonallelic homologous
recombination between the 2 segmental duplications that carry FCGR3A and
FCGR3B. They showed that pathogen richness, particularly helminth
pathogens, is likely to have influenced the patterns of variation in
FCGRs in humans. Machado et al. (2012) proposed that alterations to IgG
binding in the context of helminth infection have driven positive
selection in FCGR among different mammalian species, linking
evolutionary pressure of helminth infection with autoimmune disease via
adaptation at the genetic level. This model supports the 'hygiene
hypothesis,' which states that in the absence of chronic helminth
infection in modern populations, previously selected alleles respond to
immune system challenges differently and therefore may alter
susceptibility to autoimmune disease.

ANIMAL MODEL

Pinheiro da Silva et al. (2007) found that Fcrg (FCER1G; 147139) -/-
mice showed reduced mortality in an acute peritonitis model caused by
cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) compared with wildtype mice. The
reduced mortality in Fcrg -/- mice was associated with lower serum and
peritoneal Tnf (191160) and significantly increased capacity of
neutrophils and macrophages to phagocytose E. coli. Fcgr3 -/- mice also
had reduced sepsis after CLP. Fcgr3 bound E. coli, inducing Fcrg
phosphorylation, recruitment of tyrosine phosphatase Shp1 (PTPN6;
176883), and dephosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K;
see 171834). Decreased Pi3k activity inhibited E. coli phagocytosis and
increased Tnf production through Tlr4 (603030). Confocal microscopy
demonstrated negative regulation of Marco (604870) by Fcrg. Interaction
of E. coli with Fcgr3 induced recruitment of Shp1 to Marco and inhibited
E. coli phagocytosis. Pinheiro da Silva et al. (2007) concluded that
binding of E. coli to FCGR3 triggers an inhibitory FCRG pathway that
impairs MARCO-mediated bacterial clearance and activates TNF secretion.

FCGR3A, LEU48HIS

In a 3-year-old boy who had suffered from recurrent viral respiratory
tract infections since birth, de Vries et al. (1996) found an unusual
CD16 phenotype on the natural killer (NK) cells. Sequence analysis of
the IGFR3 gene showed a T-to-A nucleotide substitution at position 230
on both alleles, predicting a leucine-to-histidine amino acid change at
position 48 in the first extracellular Ig-like domain of the FCGR3A
protein. The child had also had severe problems with BCG vaccination and
with Epstein-Barr virus and varicella-zoster virus infections. The
clinical pattern was considered compatible with an in vivo dysfunction
of NK cells. Only 1 patient with absolute NK cell deficiency had been
previously described. Biron et al. (1989) reported the case of an
adolescent with recurrent life-threatening herpesvirus infections, who
completely lacked CD16 and/or CD56 positive cells in vivo and
NK-activity in vitro. In a note added in proof, de Vries et al. (1996)
called attention to the case of homozygosity for a IGFR3 mutation
reported by Jawahar et al. (1996).
