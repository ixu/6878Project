607185	TITLE *607185 SEC24-RELATED GENE FAMILY, MEMBER C; SEC24C
;;KIAA0079
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

In yeast, the Sec23-Sec24 complex is a component of coat protein II
(COPII; see 601924)-coated vesicles that mediate protein transport from
the endoplasmic reticulum. SEC24C is 1 of several mammalian proteins
that show structural and functional homology to yeast Sec24.

CLONING

Nomura et al. (1994) cloned SEC24C, which they called KIAA0079, from a
human immature myeloid cell line cDNA library. The deduced 1,125-amino
acid protein contains a crystallin-beta (see 123610)/gamma (see 123660)
'Greek key' motif and a glycosyl hydrolase motif. Northern blot analysis
revealed ubiquitous expression.

Tani et al. (1999) characterized KIAA0079 and noted its homology with
yeast Sec24. By Northern blot analysis, they confirmed ubiquitous
expression of a 4.4-kb transcript. SDS/PAGE of bovine brain Sec24c
indicated an apparent molecular mass of 120 kD.

Tang et al. (1999) determined that SEC24A (607183) and SEC24B (607184)
share about 56% sequence identity, while SEC24C and SEC24D (607186)
share about 52% identity. However, the identity shared between these 2
pairs is only about 20%. When expressed in COS cells, both SEC24C and
SEC24D showed cytoplasmic staining and staining of perinuclear vesicular
structures. The perinuclear membrane-associated staining for both also
colocalized well with that of SEC13 (see 600152).

By transient expression of SEC24C in green monkey kidney cells, Tani et
al. (1999) found that, when expressed at low levels, SEC24C localized in
structures scattered throughout the cytoplasm and in more central
reticular structures, with significant colocalization with a cis-Golgi
marker, beta-COP (600959).

Using expression in Chinese hamster ovary cells, Pagano et al. (1999)
confirmed that the intracellular distribution of SEC24C colocalizes with
SEC13, and that both show punctate cytoplasmic and perinuclear
distribution. RNase protection assays demonstrated that SEC24A, SEC24B,
and SEC24C were expressed simultaneously in several cell lines,
including lines originating from fibroblasts, hepatocytes, and
lymphocytes. The major difference in expression was a constant 2- to
3-fold lower level of expression of SEC24B compared with SEC24A and
SEC24C.

GENE FUNCTION

Tani et al. (1999) found that, when overexpressed in green monkey kidney
cells, SEC24C caused a defect in protein export from the endoplasmic
reticulum. Gel filtration and Western blot analyses of bovine brain
cytosol showed that Sec24c coeluted with mammalian Sec23 at a position
corresponding to an apparent molecular of 300 to 400 kD. The authors
confirmed an interaction between the proteins by in vitro pull-down
assays. By mutation analysis, they identified the interacting domains as
the C terminus of Sec24c and the N terminus of Sec23.

By gel filtration analysis, Pagano et al. (1999) determined that SEC24C
and SEC24B elute in the same fractions, corresponding to a molecular
mass of 400 kD. However, coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed no
evidence for direct interaction between SEC24C and SEC24B, although both
coimmunoprecipitated with SEC23A. Pagano et al. (1999) confirmed the
interaction between SEC24C and SEC23A by yeast 2-hybrid assays. The
interacting domain of SEC24C included amino acids 485 and 807,
containing the conserved SEC24 family domain. Within SEC23A, the
interacting domain included the N terminus up to amino acid 543.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis, Nomura et al. (1994) mapped the SEC24C
gene to chromosome 10.

602325	TITLE *602325 EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 4-GAMMA, 2; EIF4G2
;;EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 4G-LIKE 1;;
p97;;
DEATH-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 5; DAP5
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

All eukaryotic cellular mRNAs are posttranscriptionally modified by the
addition of a cap structure, m(7)GpppN (where N is any nucleotide), at
the 5-prime terminus. Translation initiation is mediated by specific
recognition of the cap structure by eukaryotic translation initiation
factor 4F (eIF4F), a cap-binding complex. Eukaryotic initiation factor
4G (EIF4G; 600495) serves as the scaffold for formation of the eIF4F
complex. Imataka et al. (1997) identified a human embryonic brain cDNA
encoding a protein of 907 amino acids, termed p97, with 28% identity to
the C-terminal two-thirds of EIF4G, a region that contains EIF4A (see
601102)- and EIF3 (see 602039)-binding sites. In vitro mutagenesis
followed by transfection into Hela cells demonstrated that the start
codon is a GTG.

Shaughnessy et al. (1997) independently cloned a mouse homolog of EIF4G,
which they designated Eif4g2, by exon trapping from a mouse YAC spanning
a site of viral integration found in myeloid leukemias of BXH2 mice.
Northern blots using the mouse gene as a probe revealed that the gene is
expressed ubiquitously in human tissues as a 4.6-kb transcript. Yamanaka
et al. (1997) reported that the mouse and human EIF4G2 (which they
termed NAT1) genes are 96% identical.

In a screen for genes involved in interferon gamma (IFNG;
147570)-induced apoptosis, Levy-Strumpf et al. (1997) identified EIF4G2
and named it DAP5 for 'death-associated protein 5.'

GENE FUNCTION

Imataka et al. (1997) used immunoprecipitation studies with HA- or
FLAG-tagged proteins to show that p97 specifically binds to EIF4A and
EIF3, but not to EIF4E (133440) in vitro. Transient transfection
experiments showed that p97 suppressed both cap-dependent and
independent translation, and that overexpression of p97 reduced overall
protein synthesis. Imataka et al. (1997) suggested that p97 is a general
repressor of translation that acts by forming translationally inactive
complexes.

Pyronnet et al. (1999) demonstrated that MNK1 (MKNK1; 606724) interacts
with the C-terminal region of p97. They hypothesized that p97 may block
phosphorylation of eIF4E by sequestering Mnk1.

Levy-Strumpf et al. (1997) showed that while a fragment of DAP5 cDNA
from the C-terminal region (encoding a 28-kD 'miniprotein') protected
cells from IFNG-induced programmed cell death at low levels of
expression, higher levels of expression were toxic. They proposed that
the miniprotein may be a dominant-negative inhibitor of the essential
DAP5 protein, and that DAP5 may play a specific role in apoptosis.

Yamanaka et al. (1997) found that NAT1 mRNA is edited at high levels by
APOBEC1 (600130), creating multiple stop codons. They suggested that
aberrant APOBEC1 editing of NAT1 mRNA may contribute to the potent
oncogenesis induced by APOBEC1 overexpression in mice.

In stressed cells, a caspase (see CASP1; 147678)-cleaved DAP5/p86
isoform regulates cap-independent translation of various mRNAs via an
internal ribosome entry site (IRES). Marash et al. (2008) showed that
DAP5 also regulated cap-independent translation in unstressed cells.
Knockdown of endogenous DAP5 in HeLa cells by short hairpin RNA induced
substantial apoptosis during M phase that was associated with reduced
translation of the antiapoptotic proteins BCL2 (151430) and CDK1 (CDC2;
116940). Cap-dependent translation was not inhibited in DAP5-knockdown
cells. Marash et al. (2008) concluded that DAP5 maintains cell survival
during mitosis by promoting cap-independent translation of prosurvival
proteins.

MAPPING

Shaughnessy et al. (1997) suggested that, based on synteny with mouse
chromosomes, the human EIF4G2 gene maps to 11p15. Yamanaka et al. (1997)
independently mapped the EIF4G2 gene to 11p15 by fluorescence in situ
hybridization.

606778	TITLE *606778 SLINGSHOT, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 1; SSH1
;;KIAA1298
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ADF (actin-depolymerizing factor)/cofilin family (see 601442) is
composed of stimulus-responsive mediators of actin dynamics. ADF/cofilin
proteins are inactivated by kinases such as LIM domain kinase-1 (LIMK1;
601329). The SSH family appears to play a role in actin dynamics by
reactivating ADF/cofilin proteins in vivo (Niwa et al., 2002).

CLONING

Niwa et al. (2002) identified the Drosophila 'slingshot' (ssh) gene,
which encodes a 1,045-amino acid phosphatase that binds F actin. The
phosphatase domain of ssh is distantly related to those of the family of
mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatases (MKPs; see 602749). Niwa
et al. (2002) identified 3 human homologs of ssh, SSH1, SSH2 (606779),
and SSH3 (606780), by genomic sequence analysis. Transcript analysis
suggested that at least 6 polypeptides would be produced from these
genes. SSH1 encodes 3 isoforms, SSH1L (1,049 amino acids), SSH1S (692
amino acids), and SSH1B (148 amino acids), and SSH2 encodes 2 isoforms,
SSH2 (449 amino acids) and SSH2B (195 amino acids). The SSH3 protein has
471 amino acids. Besides the catalytic domain, 2 other domains are
conserved between Drosophila ssh and the human SSHs (domains A and B)
and are unique to the SSH family.

GENE FUNCTION

Niwa et al. (2002) found that loss of ssh function in Drosophila
dramatically increased levels of both F actin and phospho-cofilin
(P-cofilin) and disorganized epidermal cell morphogenesis. Two of the
human proteins, SSH1L and SSH2, were enzymatically active when reacted
with an artificial substrate, p-nitrophenyl phosphate. SSH3 did not
exhibit activity toward p-nitrophenyl phosphate, and its expression did
not reduce the level of P-cofilin in COS-7 cells. In mammalian cells,
SSH1L and SSH2 suppressed LIMK1-induced actin reorganization.
Furthermore, ssh, SSH1L, and SSH2 dephosphorylated P-cofilin in cultured
cells and in cell-free assays. These results suggested that the SSH gene
family plays a pivotal role in actin dynamics by reactivating
ADF/cofilin in vivo.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SSH1
gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP stSG16406).

gene and porokeratosis, see 175900.

602892	TITLE *602892 KILLER CELL LECTIN-LIKE RECEPTOR, SUBFAMILY C, MEMBER 3; KLRC3
;;NKG2E
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Natural killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes that can mediate lysis of
certain tumor cells and virus-infected cells without previous
activation. Members of the NKG2 gene family encode NK cell-specific
lectin-like molecules that may have receptor function. See 161555. By
screening an NK cell library with an NKG2C (KLR2C; 602891) cDNA,
Adamkiewicz et al. (1994) identified cDNAs corresponding to a member of
the NKG2 family that they called NKG2E. The sequence of the predicted
261-amino acid protein is 95% identical to that of NKG2C over the first
191 amino acids.

GENE STRUCTURE

Glienke et al. (1998) determined that the NKG2C, NKG2E, and NKG2F
(602893) genes are highly similar except for variability at their
3-prime ends. The NKG2C gene contains 6 exons, whereas NKG2E has 7 exons
and NKG2F has only 4 exons.

MAPPING

By analysis of a cosmid contig, Plougastel and Trowsdale (1998) found
that the NKG2E gene and other members of the NKG2 gene family are
clustered within 350 kb on 12p13.2-p12.3. This cluster is located within
the NK complex, a region that contains C-type lectin genes
preferentially expressed on NK cells.

607741	TITLE *607741 TBC1 DOMAIN FAMILY, MEMBER 3; TBC1D3
;;TBC1D3A
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By genomic sequence analysis, Paulding et al. (2003) identified TBC1D3.
The deduced protein contains a TBC domain found in proteins involved in
RAB (see 179508) GTPase signaling. RT-PCR analysis of 15 human tissues
detected expression of TBC1D3 in liver, skeletal muscle, kidney,
pancreas, spleen, testis, ovary, small intestine, and peripheral blood
leukocytes.

By genomic sequence analysis, Hodzic et al. (2006) identified 8 paralogs
of the TBC1D3 gene on chromosome 17, including TBC1D3, which they called
paralog H. All TBC1D3 paralogs encode a deduced 549-amino acid protein,
but missense changes at 6 residues among the paralogs result in 5
different TBC1D3 isoforms. The TBC1D3 paralogs appeared to be
differentially expressed in human tissues. TBC1D3 was the only paralog
expressed in heart.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Paulding et al. (2003) mapped the TBC1D3
gene to chromosome 17q12. Genome assembly (build 35.1) indicated that
there is a nearly identical duplicated locus, TBC1D3B (610144), in the
same region (Scott, 2005).

By genomic sequence analysis, Hodzic et al. (2006) identified 8 TBC1D3
paralogs, including the TBC1D3 gene, on chromosome 17q12. The paralogs
are clustered in 2 groups of 4 genes, and each cluster spans
approximately 400 kb.

EVOLUTION

Paulding et al. (2003) determined that the TRE2 oncogene (USP6; 604334)
is derived from the chimeric fusion of the USP32 gene (607740) and the
TBC1D3 gene. USP32 is an ancient, highly conserved gene, whereas TBC1D3
is derived from a recent segmental duplication that is absent in most
other mammals and shows rapid amplification and dispersal through the
primate lineage. The chimeric TRE2 gene exists only in the hominoid
lineage of primates and arose as recently as 21 to 33 million years ago,
after proliferation of the TBC1D3 segmental duplication. In contrast to
the broad expression patterns of USP32 and TBC1D3, expression of TRE2 is
testis-specific, a pattern proposed for genes implicated in the
emergence of reproductive barriers. The authors concluded that the
sudden emergence of chimeric proteins, such as that encoded by TRE2, may
have contributed to hominoid speciation.

;;ALDEHYDE DEHYDROGENASE 8; ALDH8;;
ACETALDEHYDE DEHYDROGENASE 8
DESCRIPTION See ALDH1 (100640). Hsu et al. (1995) and Hsu and Chang (1996) reported
the cloning, sequencing and expression of the human ALDH8 gene. Hsu et
al. (1997) determined the structure of the ALDH7 (600466) and ALDH8
genes. The ALDH7 gene spans about 20 kb of genomic DNA and contains 9
coding exons. The ALDH8 gene is over 10 kb long and contains at least 10
exons. The ALDH8 gene contains an in-frame stop codon at the seventeenth
codon position from the first initiator methionine. The coding region of
the ALDH7 gene shows about 86% nucleotide identity with the
corresponding region of the ALDH8 gene. The numbers and positions of the
introns of the 2 genes are conserved, suggesting that gene duplication
is involved in the expansion of the ALDH gene family. The human ALDH7
and ALDH8 genes have a close evolutionary relationship with human ALDH3
(100660).

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the ALDH8
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP U37519).

610771	TITLE *610771 CHROMODOMAIN HELICASE DNA-BINDING PROTEIN 5; CHD5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Changes in gene expression are associated with changes in chromatin
structure, which can result from modification of histones by acetylation
and methylation. In addition, SWI/SNF proteins can effect chromatin
structure and gene expression by causing ATP-dependent disruption of the
nucleosome and by enhancing binding of transcription factors. CHD5
belongs to a group of SWI/SNF proteins called CHD proteins, which
contain a SWI/SNF-like helicase/ATPase domain, as well as a DNA-binding
domain and a chromodomain that directly modifies chromatin structure
(Thompson et al., 2003).

CLONING

By sequence analysis of a region on chromosome 1 frequently deleted in
neuroblastomas, followed by PCR and 5-prime RACE of a fetal brain cDNA
library, Thompson et al. (2003) cloned CHD5. The predicted 1,954-amino
acid CHD5 protein contains 2 N-terminal PHD zinc fingers, followed by 2
chromodomains, a central helicase/ATPase domain, and a C-terminal
DNA-binding domain. It has several potential nuclear localization
signals. Among CHD proteins, CHD5 is most homologous to CHD3 and CHD4,
sharing 70% and 76% amino acid identity, respectively. It shares 93%
amino acid identity with its mouse homolog. RT-PCR detected CHD5
expression in adult and fetal total brain, cerebellum, and adrenal
gland, but not in any other tissue examined.

GENE STRUCTURE

Thompson et al. (2003) determined that the CHD5 gene contains 42 exons
and spans more than 78 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Thompson et al. (2003) mapped the CHD5
gene to chromosome 1p36.3. This region is frequently deleted in
neuroblastomas and other neural crest tumors, suggesting that CHD5
deletion might contribute to cancer. Thompson et al. (2003) also noted
that microdeletions in monosomy 1p36 syndrome (607872) would include the
CHD5 gene, suggesting that haploinsufficiency of CHD5 may contribute to
the neurologic and developmental problems seen in those patients.

Bagchi et al. (2007) mapped the mouse Cdh5 gene to chromosome 4 in a
region that shows homology of synteny to human chromosome 1p36.

ANIMAL MODEL

Deletions of chromosome 1p36 are common in human malignancies of
epithelial, neural, and hematopoietic origins. To identify tumor
suppressor genes in this region, Bagchi et al. (2007) used Cre-lox
methodology to generate mice with either a gain or loss of the syntenic
4.5-Mb interval on mouse chromosome 4. Fibroblasts from embryos
heterozygous for an extra copy of the region showed decreased
proliferation and increased senescence compared with wildtype
fibroblasts, whereas fibroblasts from embryos heterozygous for a single
copy of the region showed enhanced proliferation. Fibroblasts from
embryos heterozygous for the duplicated region could be serially
passaged in culture only 8 to 10 times, but fibroblasts from embryos
heterozygous for a single copy of the region grew indefinitely. Mice
heterozygous for a single copy of the region were indistinguishable from
wildtype mice at embryonic day 17.5, although adult mice frequently
developed hyperplasia. In contrast, embryos of mice heterozygous for the
duplicated region died perinatally due to developmental abnormalities
resulting from increased apoptosis. Embryos with the duplicated interval
on one chromosome and the deleted interval on the other chromosome
(i.e., normal copy number) were indistinguishable from wildtype embryos.
Mice heterozygous for the duplicated interval could be rescued on a
background with a single p53 gene (TP53; 191170), indicating that the
increased dosage acted through the p53 pathway. To identify the
causative gene, Bagchi et al. (2007) used short hairpin RNA
(shRNA)-mediated knockdown of several genes in the interval and found
that only shRNA against Chd5 efficiently rescued the proliferative
effect of fibroblasts heterozygous for the duplicated interval.
Additional experiments using fibroblasts from embryos heterozygous for a
single copy of the interval or a duplication of the interval, as well as
fibroblasts in which Chd5 expression was knocked down by RNA
interference, showed that Chd5 modulated p53 through the intermediaries
p19(Arf) and p16(Ink4a), which are encoded by the Cdkn2a gene (600160).
Bagchi et al. (2007) concluded that CHD5 is a tumor suppressor that
controls proliferation, apoptosis, and senescence via the p19(ARF)/p53
pathway. When more copies of CHD5 are present, more p19(ARF) is produced

608352	TITLE *608352 ACROSIN-BINDING PROTEIN; ACRBP
;;PROACROSIN-BINDING PROTEIN SP32 PRECURSOR; SP32;;
OY-TES-1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to mouse Pem (see
300446), followed by PCR and 5-prime RACE of a human testis cDNA
library, Ono et al. (2001) cloned ACRBP, which they designated OY-TES-1.
The deduced 543-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal glutamic acid-
and glutamine-rich domain and a central acidic amino acid region. It has
20 cysteine residues that are completely conserved between several
mammalian species. The mature protein is cleaved between arg273 and
glu274. ACRBP shares 77.2%, 81.9%, and 75.2% amino acid identity with
its guinea pig, pig, and mouse homologs, respectively. RT-PCR of several
human tissues detected ACRBP expression only in testis. ACRBP was also
expressed in a subset of tumors of varied tissue origin. A serologic
survey found antibodies against ACRBP in 25 of 362 cancer patients. No
ACRBP reactivity was found in 20 normal individuals.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ono et al. (2001) determined that the ACRBP gene contains 10 exons and
spans more than 9.3 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis and FISH, Ono et al. (2001) mapped the
ACRBP gene to chromosome 12p13-p12. Southern blot analysis indicated
that there are 2 ACRBP-related genes in the human genome.

614570	TITLE *614570 KINESIN FAMILY MEMBER 18B; KIF18B
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

KIF18B belongs to the kinesin superfamily of ATPases that move cargo
molecules or organelles along microtubules from the center of the cell
toward the cell periphery. Kinesins contain 4 major domains: a globular
motor domain with binding sites for microtubules and ATP; a short linker
region; a long coiled-coil stalk for dimerization; and a cargo-binding
C-terminal tail domain (summary by Lee et al., 2010).

CLONING

By RT-PCR of HeLa cell mRNA, Lee et al. (2010) cloned KIF18B. The
deduced 842-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 92 kD.
The motor and stalk domains of KIF18B share 60% identity with the
corresponding region of KIF18A (611271). RT-PCR of several human cell
lines revealed a KIF18B splice variant encoding a deduced 873-amino acid
protein, which the authors called isoform-2. Compared with isoform-1,
isoform-2 contains a unique C-terminal end that includes 3 overlapping
PxxP motifs. Northern blot analysis of HeLa cell RNA revealed a 3.0-kb
transcript. RNA dot-blot analysis of several tissues revealed high
KIF18B expression only in amygdala, with weak expression in a limited
number of other adult tissues, fetal tissues, and human cell lines.
RT-PCR analysis revealed variable KIF18B expression in all human cell
lines examined. Western blot analysis of synchronized HeLa cells showed
that KIF18B expression was elevated at late G2 through metaphase and
that KIF18B had an apparent molecular mass of 120 kD.
Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that KIF18B was present
predominantly in the nucleus and to a lesser extent in the cytoplasm of
interphase cells. During mitosis, most KIF18B was closely associated
with the plus end of astral microtubules emanating from the spindle pole
during prometaphase and metaphase. KIF18B was not detected at anaphase
and telophase. Database analysis revealed orthologs of KIF18B in several
vertebrate species.

Tanenbaum et al. (2011) found that KIF18B localized to microtubule plus
ends during early prometaphase in human U2OS osteosarcoma cells. KIF18B
was not expressed in G1 and was sequestered in the nucleus in G2. KIF18B
was completely degraded at the metaphase-anaphase transition.

GENE FUNCTION

By mutation analysis, Lee et al. (2010) found that only 1 of 3 putative
nuclear localization signals in KIF18B directed nuclear localization.

Using U2OS human osteosarcoma cells, Tanenbaum et al. (2011) identified
KIF18B as an essential component of a microtubule-depolymerizing complex
containing MCAK (KIF2C; 604538) and EB1 (MAPRE1; 603108). KIF18B
interacted independently with MCAK and a subset of EB1 at microtubule
plus ends. All 3 proteins, in addition to KIF18B motor activity, were
required for efficient plus-end microtubule depolymerization. Knockdown
of either KIF18B or MCAK reduced the localization of the other protein
at microtubule plus ends and reduced microtubule depolymerization.
Disruption of the MCAK-KIF18B interaction by mutation of the interacting
domains, or phosphorylation of MCAK by the microtubule-polymerizing
agents Aurora A (AURKA; 603072) or Aurora B (AURKB; 604970), similarly
blocked microtubule depolymerization. Use of a KIF5B (602809)/KIF18B
chimera revealed that the major role of KIF18B motor domain in this
process was to provide plus end-directed movement along microtubules.
Tanenbaum et al. (2011) hypothesized that KIF18B, released into the
cytoplasm upon mitotic nuclear envelope breakdown, is recruited to
microtubule plus ends through interaction with EB1 and MCAK. The motor
activity of KIF18B directs the complex to the tip of microtubules, and
the depolymerizing activity of the complex is modulated by Aurora A and
Aurora B.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lee et al. (2010) determined that the KIF18B gene contains 15 exons, the
last of which is alternatively spliced.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the KIF18B gene to chromosome 17q21.31 based on an
alignment of the KIF18B sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC044933) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

602503	TITLE *602503 FREQUENTLY REARRANGED IN ADVANCED T-CELL LYMPHOMAS; FRAT1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Retroviral infection of oncogene-bearing transgenic mice can be used to
identify cooperating oncogenes (see 164831). Jonkers et al. (1997)
infected E-mu-Pim1 mice with Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) to
induce accelerated onset of T-cell lymphomas with proviral insertions in
Myc (190080) or NMyc (164840). They then transplanted the tumors to
syngeneic hosts to allow proviral tagging of genes involved in the later
stages of tumor development. The gene Frat1 was identified as one that
was frequently mutated by proviral insertion during later stages of
T-cell lymphomagenesis. Mouse Frat1 is an intronless gene that encodes a
predicted 274-amino acid protein. All proviral insertions left the
coding domain intact, suggesting to Jonkers et al. (1997) that it is
overexpression of the normal gene that contributes to transformation.
Overexpression of Frat1 in lymphoma cells that overexpressed Myc and
Pim1 conferred a selective advantage. Jonkers et al. (1997) identified
the human FRAT1 gene using the mouse gene as a probe. The human FRAT1
gene encodes a polypeptide of 279 amino acids that is 79% identical to
the mouse protein.

Dorsal accumulation of beta-catenin (CTNNB1; 116806) in early Xenopus
embryos is required for body axis formation. Beta-catenin is dorsally
stabilized by the localized inhibition of the kinase GSK3 (see GSK3B;
605004). Using a yeast 2-hybrid system to identify a cytoplasmic
regulator of Xenopus GSK3, Yost et al. (1998) isolated an oocyte cDNA
encoding a 169-amino acid protein that they termed GSK3-binding protein,
or GBP. By searching sequence databases, Yost et al. (1998) identified 2
homologous human sequences, FRAT1 and FRAT2 (605006), a partial sequence
that shares 59% amino acid identity with FRAT1. Sequence analysis
predicted that GBP and the FRAT proteins contain 3 well-conserved
regions.

GENE FUNCTION

Binding and functional analyses by Yost et al. (1998) revealed that the
GSK3-binding and -inhibitory activities of Xenopus GBP and human FRAT2
reside in the C-terminal conserved domain III sequence, which is shared
with FRAT1. The authors proposed that GBP, FRAT1, and FRAT2 form a
family of GSK3-binding proteins that inhibit the phosphorylation of
beta-catenin, preventing its degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome
pathway.

MAPPING

Jonkers et al. (1997) mapped the Frat1 gene to chromosome 19 in mouse
and, by homology of synteny, to 10q23-q24 in humans.

ANIMAL MODEL

Inhibition of GSK3 by FRAT was thought to be important for Wnt (see
WNT1; 164820) signal transduction through beta-catenin. To test this
hypothesis, van Amerongen et al. (2005) developed triple-knockout mice
lacking Frat1, Frat2, and Frat3. They found that Frat-null mice were
viable, healthy, and fertile. In addition, in vitro assays of primary
Frat-deficient cells showed that Wnt signaling through beta-catenin was
unaffected. Van Amerongen et al. (2005) concluded that Wnt signaling in
higher vertebrates is not dependent on Frat.

104701	TITLE *104701 AMYLASE, SALIVARY, B; AMY1B
DESCRIPTION To investigate the genomic organization of the human alpha-amylase
genes, Groot et al. (1989) isolated the pertinent genes from a cosmid
library constructed of DNA from an individual expressing 3 different
salivary amylase allozymes. From the restriction maps of the overlapping
cosmids and a comparison of these maps with the restriction enzyme
patterns of DNA from the donor and family members, they were able to
identify 2 haplotypes consisting of very different numbers of salivary
amylase genes. The short haplotype contained 2 pancreatic genes, AMY2A
and AMY2B, and 1 salivary amylase gene, AMY1C, arranged in the order
2B--2A--1C, encompassing a total length of approximately 100 kb. The
long haplotype spanned about 300 kb and contained 6 additional genes
arranged in 2 repeats, each one consisting of 2 salivary genes, AMY1A
and AMY1B, and a pseudogene lacking the first 3 exons, AMYP1. The order
of the amylase genes within the repeat was 1A--1B--P1. All of the genes
were in a head-to-tail orientation except AMY1B, which had the reverse
orientation with respect to the other genes.

605143	TITLE *605143 ACTIN-RELATED PROTEIN 1A; ACTR1A
;;ARP1;;
CENTRACTIN, ALPHA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ACTR1A is an essential subunit of the 20S dynactin complex, which is
involved in microtubule-dependent vesicular transport, spindle assembly,
and cell division. Polymers of 8 to 13 ACTR1 molecules make up the
central 37-nm filament that forms the base of the dynactin complex
(summary by Karki et al., 2000).

CLONING

By randomly sequencing a brain cDNA library, Adams et al. (1991)
identified a cDNA (EST00370) encoding a 37-amino acid peptide with 76%
similarity to actin.

Using oligonucleotide probes derived from clone EST00370 to screen a
teratocarcinoma library, Lees-Miller et al. (1992) obtained a cDNA
encoding ACTR1A, which they called actin-RPV (vertebrate actin-related
protein). Sequence analysis predicted that the 376-amino acid ACTR1A
protein shares only 69% amino acid similarity with vertebrate actins;
most of the nonconservative substitutions occur in the surface loops of
ACTR1A rather than the core structure. Two-dimensional immunoblot
analysis of the dynactin complex, an activator of dynein-driven vesicle
movement (see 601143), determined that ACTR1A is the most abundant
molecule in the complex and is expressed as a 45-kD protein with a pI of
6.8.

By screening a testis cDNA library with a canine alpha-centractin probe,
Clark et al. (1994) isolated cDNAs encoding ACTR1A, which they called
alpha-centractin. Northern blot analysis detected variable levels of a
3.0-kb ACTR1A transcript in all tissues tested. The same probe also
detected a 1.3-kb transcript representing a putative truncated isoform,
which the authors called centractin-gamma. Two-dimensional immunoblot
analysis determined that ACTR1A is expressed in the cytosol as part of
the dynactin complex as a 43-kD protein with a pI of 6.6; levels of
ACTR1A were at least 15-fold greater than those of ACTR1B (605144).

GENE FUNCTION

Eaton et al. (2002) disrupted the dynactin complex in Drosophila, using
3 separate perturbations: dsRNA interference with arp1, mutation in
p150/Glued (homolog of DCTN1; 601143), and a dominant-negative Glued
transgene. In all 3 cases, the disruption resulted in an increase in the
frequency and extent of synaptic retraction events at the neuromuscular
junction. Eaton et al. (2002) concluded that dynactin functions locally
within the presynaptic arbor to promote synapse stability at the
neuromuscular junction.

Karki et al. (2000) noted that one end of the ARP1 filament is likely
capped by the alpha (see 601580) and beta (CAPZB; 601572) subunits of
capping protein. They found that the other end of ARP1 was bound by p62
dynactin (DCTN4; 614758).

MAPPING

Gross (2012) mapped the ACTR1A gene to chromosome 10q24.32 based on an
alignment of the ACTR1A sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK302072) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;RNA HELICASE, 54-KD; p54;;
HELICASE, RNA, NUCLEAR 2; HLR2;;
ONCOGENE RCK
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DDX6 belongs to the DEAD box family of putative RNA helicases that
contain a characteristic asp-glu-ala-asp (DEAD) box motif (Seto et al.,
1995). DDX6 localizes to cytoplasmic processing bodies (P bodies)
involved in mRNA storage, processing, regulation, and degradation and is
required for P-body formation (Scheller et al., 2007).

CLONING

Akao et al. (1991) cloned the breakpoint of the t(11;14)(q23;q32) in
B-cell lymphoma (Akao et al., 1990), as represented in the RC-K8 cell
line, and named the locus RCK. Using a probe from the t(11;14)
breakpoint, Akao et al. (1992) isolated a partial cDNA for the RCK gene,
which detected a 7.5-kb mRNA. The predicted RCK protein has 472 amino
acids and shares sequence homology with a translation initiation
factor/helicase family.

Lu and Yunis (1992) cloned a putative human RNA helicase, p54, from a
lymphoid cell line with chromosomal breakpoint 11q23.3. The predicted
amino acid sequence shares 75% identity with the female
germline-specific RNA helicase ME31B gene of Drosophila. Unlike ME31B,
however, the human gene expressed an abundant transcript in a large
number of adult tissues.

Seto et al. (1995) found that the RCK/p54 gene, which encodes a 472- to
483-amino acid peptide belonging to the RNA helicase/translation
initiation factor family, is highly conserved in mouse. The mouse cDNA
shows 93.7% nucleotide identity and 97.7% predicted amino acid identity
with human RCK.

Using Northern blot analysis, Scheller et al. (2007) detected variable
expression of a 7.5-kb RCK transcript in all human tissues examined. In
HeLa cells, RCK colocalized with PATL1 (614660), LSM (607281), and CDP1
(see 607010) in cytoplasmic P bodies.

MAPPING

By analysis of a B-cell lymphoma with t(11;14)(q23;q32), Akao et al.
(1991) mapped the DDX6 gene to chromosome 11q23. Tunnacliffe et al.
(1993) assigned the DDX6 gene more precisely using a panel of sequence
tagged sites (STSs) representing 30 markers previously assigned to
11q23.

Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, Akao and Matsuda (1996) mapped
the Ddx6 gene to mouse chromosome 9.

CYTOGENETICS

Akao et al. (1992) stated that by pulsed field gel electrophoresis, they
had previously shown that the RCK locus was centromeric to the PBGD gene
(HMBS; 609806) on chromosome 11q23, while the breakpoints of infantile
leukemia cell lines with t(11;19)(q23;p13) were detected by a probe for
CD3D (186790), which is centromeric to RCK. Akao et al. (1992) did
long-range mapping from the CD3 genes to the PBGD gene on 11q23 to
determine the relationship between RCK and MLL (159555). They showed
that RCK and MLL are on different NotI fragments, indicating that 2
different genes are associated with 11q23 translocations in
hematopoietic tumors.

Lu and Yunis (1992) found that the 5-prime noncoding region of p54 was
split in a t(11;14)(q23.3;q32.3) cell line from a diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma.

GENE FUNCTION

Using mass spectroscopy, Fenger-Gron et al. (2005) found that RCK, EDC3
(YJDC; 609842), and HEDLS (RCD8; 606030) coimmunopurified with DCP1A
(607010) and DCP2 (609844) from HEK293 cell lysates. Overexpression of
DCP2, RCK, or EDC3 in HeLa cells reduced the association of endogenous
DCP1A and XRN1 (607994) with cytoplasmic P bodies.

Using small interfering RNAs, Scheller et al. (2007) found that
knockdown of PATL1 or RCK reduced the number of P bodies in HeLa cells.

;;PR55-ALPHA;;
B55-ALPHA
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Protein phosphorylation on serine and threonine residues by protein
kinases is responsible for the communication of many intracellular
signals. Equally important is the dephosphorylation of proteins by
serine/threonine phosphatases. Protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A; see
176915), a heterotrimeric serine/threonine phosphatase, has a
particularly complex set of regulatory subunits controlling its function
and localization. By screening lung fibroblast and fetal brain cDNA
libraries using 2 overlapping oligonucleotides corresponding to a
tryptic peptide derived from the 55-kD subunit of rabbit PP2A (PR55),
Mayer et al. (1991) isolated human cDNAs encoding PPP2R2A and PPP2R2B
(604325), which they termed PR55-alpha and PR55-beta, respectively. The
deduced 447-amino acid PPP2R2A protein has a calculated molecular mass
of approximately 52 kD. SDS-PAGE analysis, however, showed that PPP2R2A
was expressed as a 55-kD protein. The nucleotide sequence of PPP2R2A is
75% identical to PPP2R2B in the coding region. Northern blot analysis
detected PPP2R2A transcripts of 2.3 and 2.5 kb, as well as a less
abundant one of 4.4 kb, in all cell lines examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Hyperphosphorylation of Tau (MAPT; 157140) contributes to Alzheimer
disease (104300), and PP2A dephosphorylates Tau, reducing its
deleterious effect. Using an in vitro assay with recombinant human
proteins, Xu et al. (2008) showed that the B-alpha subunit specifically
and markedly facilitated dephosphorylation of phosphorylated Tau by
heterotrimeric PP2A.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PPP2R2A
gene to chromosome 8 (TMAP WI-18898).

600958	TITLE *600958 MYOSIN-BINDING PROTEIN C, CARDIAC; MYBPC3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cardiac myosin-binding protein C (MYBPC3) is arrayed transversely in
sarcomere A-bands and binds myosin heavy chain (see 160710) in thick
filaments and titin (188840) in elastic filaments. Phosphorylation of
this protein appears to modulate contraction.

GENE STRUCTURE

Carrier et al. (1997) reported that the MYBPC3 gene spans more than 21
kb and contains 35 exons. Two exons are unusually small, 3 bp each.

Klaassen (2013) noted that the MYBPC3 gene contains a noncoding exon 1.
Some authors (e.g., Probst et al., 2011) have used this noncoding exon
in the numbering of the exons in the gene.

GENE FUNCTION

Using single-particle fluorescence imaging techniques, transgenic
protein expression, proteomics, and modeling, Previs et al. (2012) found
that cMyBP-C slows actomyosin motion generation in native cardiac thick
filaments. This mechanical effect was localized to where cMyBP-C resides
within the thick filament (i.e., the C-zones) and was modulated by
phosphorylation and site-specific proteolytic degradation. Previs et al.
(2012) concluded that their results provided molecular insight into why
cMyBP-C should be considered a member of a tripartite complex with actin
and myosin that allows fine tuning of cardiac muscle contraction.

MAPPING

Gautel et al. (1995) mapped the MYBPC3 gene to 11p11.2 by fluorescence
in situ hybridization and proposed it as a candidate for the site of the
mutation in familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy-4 (CMH4; 115197), which
maps to the same region.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Watkins et al. (1995) found that the MYBPC3 gene was linked to CMH4 and
demonstrated a splice donor mutation (600958.0001) in 1 family with
familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and a duplication mutation
(600958.0002) in a second. Both mutations were predicted to disrupt the
high-affinity, C-terminal myosin-binding domain of cardiac MyBP-C.
Again, findings demonstrated that as in the case of the 3 forms that had
been defined in molecular terms previously, familial hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy is a disease of the sarcomere.

In 2 unrelated French families with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
of the CMH4 type (as indicated by linkage), Bonne et al. (1995) found a
mutation in a splice acceptor site of the MYBPC3 gene which caused
skipping of the associated exon and was predicted to produce a truncated
gene product. The 2 families shared a common haplotype in a region of 2
cM around the MYBPC gene, suggesting that they may be distantly related.

Carrier et al. (1997) found 6 novel mutations in the CYBPC3 gene that
were associated with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in 7 unrelated
French families. Four of these mutations were predicted to produce
truncated cardiac myosin-binding protein C polypeptides (e.g.,
600958.0007). The 2 others produced aberrant proteins, 1 truncated
(600985.0005) and 1 mutated (600958.0006).

Mutations in the gene for cardiac myosin-binding protein C account for
approximately 15% of cases of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
Niimura et al. (1998) studied the spectrum of disease-causing mutations
and the associated clinical features of these gene defects. Among 16
families studied, 12 novel mutations were identified: 4 missense
mutations and 8 defects (insertions, deletions, and splice mutations)
predicted to truncate cardiac myosin-binding protein C. The clinical
expression of either missense or truncation mutations was similar to
that observed for other genetic causes of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,
but the age at onset of the disease differed markedly. Only 58% of
adults under the age of 50 years who had a mutation in the MYBPC3 gene
(68 of 117 patients) had cardiac hypertrophy; disease penetrance
remained incomplete through the age of 60 years. Survival was generally
better than that observed among patients with hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy caused by mutations in other genes for sarcomere
proteins. Most deaths due to cardiac causes in these families occurred
suddenly.

In 46 young patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (CMD1MM; 615396),
Daehmlow et al. (2002) performed mutation screening of 4 sarcomeric
protein genes. They identified 2 mutations in the MYH7 gene
(160760.0026-160760.0027) and 1 mutation in the MYBPC3 gene
(asn948-to-thr; 600958.0013). Daehmlow et al. (2002) noted that they
could not confirm the disease-causing nature of these variants because
family members for the calculation of 2-point lod scores could not be
obtained for further investigation.

Konno et al. (2003) analyzed the MYBPC3 gene in 250 unrelated probands
with CMH and 90 with CMD and identified a missense mutation (R820Q;
600958.0015) in 16 individuals from families with CMH and in a
71-year-old man with a clinical diagnosis of CMD. The authors suggested
that the patient diagnosed with CMD may actually have been in the
'burnt-out' phase of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Lekanne Deprez et al. (2006) reported 2 unrelated Dutch infants with
severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in whom they identified compound
heterozygosity for truncating mutations in the MYBPC3 gene (see, e.g.,
600958.0023). The infants died at 5 and 6 weeks of age. The
nonconsanguineous asymptomatic parents were heterozygous carriers of 1
of the mutations in each case; 1 of the fathers was found to have mild
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy on cardiac MRI.

Wang et al. (2005) observed that patients with hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy carrying identical mutations can have different left
ventricular thicknesses, suggesting the presence of modifying variants.
They genotyped 226 patients with CMH and 226 age- and sex-matched
controls for 3 MYBPC3 polymorphisms, and found that the GG genotype at
nucleotide 18443 in exon 30 was associated with a significantly thicker
left ventricular wall in patients, compared to the AA and AG genotypes
(p less than 0.001). GG was not associated with left ventricular wall
thickness in normal controls, and there was no difference in genotype
distribution between patients and controls. Wang et al. (2005) concluded
that the MYBPC3 polymorphism is a modifier for expression of cardiac
hypertrophy in patients with CMH.

In a 12-month-old girl with restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM3; 612422),
Peddy et al. (2006) performed direct sequencing of the 8 genes most
commonly implicated in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and identified a de
novo 3-bp deletion in the TNNT2 gene (191045.0011). The girl also
carried a known MYBPC3 (600958) polymorphism, V896M, which was also
found in her unaffected father; the authors suggested that the V896M
variant may have acted as a modifier, exacerbating the phenotypic
expression of the TNNT2 mutation and causing an unusually early onset of
RMC.

In 23 Old Order Amish infants with severe neonatal hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy, Xin et al. (2007) identified homozygosity for a splice
site mutation in the MYBPC3 gene (3330+2T-G; 600958.0020). Noting the
many reports of cardiac symptoms, including sudden death, among these
probands' parents and relatives, and the close similarity between this
mutation and the 3330+5G-C mutation (600958.0001) previously documented
by Watkins et al. (1995) as the cause of CMH in heterozygous carriers,
Xin et al. (2007) suggested that heterozygotes for the 3330+2T-G
mutation may also be at risk for CMH.

Frank-Hansen et al. (2008) used SSCP analysis and sequence confirmation
in 250 unrelated patients with CMH to determine whether intronic
variation flanking the 3 microexons in the MYBPC3 gene is
disease-causing. Functional studies and segregation analysis indicated
that 4 of the 7 mutations they identified are associated with CMH (see,
e.g., 600958.0016 and 600958.0017): all 4 mutations result in premature
termination codons, suggesting that haploinsufficiency is a pathogenic
mechanism of this type of mutation. In 1 family, a second mutation in
the MYBPC3 gene was also identified (V1125M; 600958.0018).

Ehlermann et al. (2008) screened the MYBPC3 gene in 87 patients with
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and 71 patients with CMD and identified
heterozygous mutations in 16 (18.4%) of the CMH patients and in 2 (2.8%)
of the CMD patients. However, in the first CMD family, 3 additional
carriers of the MYBPC3 missense mutation had no certain pathologic
findings, and the authors noted that in the index patient, hypertensive
heart disease could not be ruled out as the cause of his CMD phenotype.
In the second CMD family, the 2 oldest carriers of the splice site
mutation displayed CMD, whereas 4 younger mutation carriers showed CMH;
the authors stated that it was mostly likely that the 2 older patients
suffered from end-stage CMH with progression to a CMD phenotype.
Screening the cohort for variation in 5 additional
cardiomyopathy-associated genes (MYH7, 160760; TNNT2, 191045; TNNI3,
191044; ACTC1, 102540; and TPM1, 191010) revealed no further mutations.
Of a total of 45 affected individuals, from 12 families and 6 sporadic
patients, 23 (51%) suffered an adverse event such as progression to
severe heart failure, transient ischemic attack, stroke, or sudden
death.

Waldmuller et al. (2003) identified a 25-bp deletion in intron 32 of the
MYBPC3 gene (600958.0019) in 2 south Indian families with CMH, 1 of
which was also known to carry a mutation in the MYH7 gene (160760). The
polymorphism was detected in 16 of 229 unrelated healthy Indian
individuals but not in western European individuals, and the authors
considered that it represents a regional polymorphism restricted to
southern India. Waldmuller et al. (2003) stated that the relationship to
disease was 'not unequivocal' and suggested that the deletion may
represent a modifier polymorphism that may enhance the phenotypes of
mutations responsible for disease. Dhandapany et al. (2009) analyzed the
25-bp deletion in the MYBPC3 gene in Indian patients with hypertrophic,
dilated, and restrictive cardiomyopathies and identified an association
with familial cardiomyopathy and an increased risk of heart failure
(overall odds ratio, 6.99; p = 4 x 10(-11)).

After typing 811 genomewide short-tandem repeat markers in 100 members
of a CMH family originally reported by Niimura et al. (1998), 36 of whom
carried the MYBPC3 791insG mutation (600958.0011), Daw et al. (2007)
performed oligogenic simultaneous segregation and linkage analyses using
Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and detected the strongest signals on
chromosomes 10p13 and 17q24, with log of the posterior placement
probability ratio (LOP) scores of 4.86 and 4.17, respectively. The
effect size of the MYBPC3 mutation on left ventricular mass was
significantly decreased when modifier loci were included in the
analysis, suggesting an interaction between the causal mutation and
modifier genes.

In a 28-year-old Australian man who was diagnosed at age 18 years with
severe CMH, Ingles et al. (2005) detected compound heterozygous missense
mutations in the MYBPC3 gene (600958.0021 and 600958.0022). Chiu et al.
(2007) also identified a heterozygous R73Q substitution in the CALR3
gene (611414) in this patient. Chiu et al. (2007) suggested that
calreticulin may be involved in both disease pathogenesis and
modification.

In a female infant with fatal cardiomyopathy who also showed evidence of
skeletal myopathy, Tajsharghi et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for
a nonsense mutation in the MYBPC3 gene (R943X; 600958.0023). Skeletal
muscle biopsy at 2 months of age showed pronounced myopathic changes
with numerous small fibers; immunohistochemical staining showed the
presence of cardiac MYBPC in the small abnormal fibers, and RT-PCR and
sequencing demonstrated the mutation in transcripts of skeletal muscle.
Tajsharghi et al. (2010) noted that cardiac MYBPC is not normally
expressed in skeletal muscle and stated that the reason for the ectopic
expression of cardiac MYBPC remained unknown.

Hershberger et al. (2010) screened 5 cardiomyopathy-associated genes in
312 patients with CMD, who had previously been studied by Hershberger et
al. (2008), and identified 12 MYBPC3 variants in 13 (4.2%) of the
probands, of which 2 were considered to be 'likely' disease-causing
mutations: A833T (600958.0024) and C1264F (600958.0025). The A833T
change was identified in affected individuals from 3 families; haplotype
analysis suggested a founder mutation. Hershberger et al. (2010) noted
that the A833T mutation had previously been identified in a family with
CMH (Morner et al., 2003).

In a cohort of 63 unrelated white patients of western European descent
with left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC10; see 615396), Probst et al.
(2011) analyzed 8 sarcomere genes and identified 5 probands with 4
different heterozygous mutations in the MYBPC3 gene (see, e.g.,
600958.0026-600958.0028). In a 21-year-old man from a consanguineous
Chinese family with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Wang et al. (2013)
screened the coding sequence and flanking regions of 26 CMH-related
genes and identified a homozygous missense mutation in the MYBPC3 gene
(G490V; 600958.0029). His affected younger brother was also homozygous
for the mutation; 6 other relatives, including their unaffected parents,
were heterozygous for the mutation. None of the heterozygous carriers
had any of the typical clinical manifestations of CMH, including the 2
oldest carriers at ages 62 years and 71 years, and none showed
abnormalities on electrocardiography or left ventricular hypertrophy on
echocardiography. CMR of 3 heterozygous individuals showed no structural
abnormalities or cardiac fibrosis. Wang et al. (2013) noted that a
different mutation at the same residue, G490R (600958.0026), had
previously been reported to cause disease in heterozygosity; they
proposed that the difference in inheritance pattern might stem from the
fact that G490R produces a more prominent structural change by
substituting a small side chain for a bulky one and changing the
polarity from neutral to basic, whereas G490V keeps the side chain small
and polarity neutral.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Charron et al. (1998) studied clinical features of 76 individuals
heterozygous for disease-causing mutations in the MYBPC3 gene. Little
phenotypic variation was noted among the 7 MYBPC3 mutations described.
Compared to 52 individuals with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy due
to myosin heavy chain gene mutations, prognosis was significantly better
in patients with CMH due to MYBPC3 mutations. In patients with MYBPC3
mutations, the mean age of onset was higher and penetrance below the age
of 30 was lower, leading to a milder phenotype with less hypertrophy and
fewer T-wave abnormalities. No deaths occurred below the age of 40
regardless of the mutation involved. Cause of death was sudden death in
4 of 9 individuals, refractory heart failure in 3 of 9 individuals, and
stroke in 2 of 9 individuals.

To test the hypothesis that some cardiac hypertrophy of the elderly
might be attributable to sarcomere protein gene mutations, Niimura et
al. (2002) conducted a genetic analysis of 31 individuals with
late-onset hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and no other family history. Five
individuals with pathogenic mutations in MYBPC were identified. The mean
age of symptom development in this group was 56 +/- 13.2 with a mean age
at diagnosis of 60.2 +/- 8.9. The reported mutations in the MYBPC3 gene
included missense mutations, truncating mutations, and splice mutations.
The authors highlighted the importance of these findings for counseling
relatives of individuals with elderly-onset hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Seidman (2000) pointed out that correlations between genotype and
prognosis in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is possible. Life expectancy is
markedly diminished in individuals with the R719W (160760.0017) and
R403Q (160760.0001) mutations in the MYH7 gene but near normal in
individuals with the E542Q (600958.0006) and 791insG (600958.0011)
mutations in the MYBPC3 gene.

Verweij and Hamel (2002) discussed the moral dilemma when there are
unexpected findings in identifiable stored blood samples collected for
an unrelated study and not carrying consent for other use. The case in
point was that of a woman in a family with triphalangeal
thumb-polysyndactyly syndrome (174500) in which the disorder was mapped
to 7q36 (Tsukurov et al., 1994). The samples were used to study genes
involved in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and a mutation in the MYBPC3
gene was found. Verweij and Hamel (2002) discussed the benefits and
harmful consequences of disclosure, including the uncertainty of the
functional significance of the particular mutation.

Van Driest et al. (2004) analyzed the MYBPC3 gene in a cohort of 389 CMH
probands who had previously been genotyped for mutation in genes
encoding the sarcomeric proteins comprising the thick filament (MYH7 and
the regulatory and essential light chains, MYL2 and MYL3) and the thin
filament (TNNT2, TNNI3, TPM1, and ACTC). Forty-six different MYBPC3
mutations were identified in 71 (18%) of the patients. Patients with
MYBPC3 mutations did not differ significantly from patients with thick
filament-CMH, thin filament-CMH, or genotype-negative CMH with respect
to age at diagnosis, degree of hypertrophy, incidence of myectomy, or
family history of CMH or sudden death. The 10 patients with multiple
mutations (2.6% of the total cohort) had the most severe disease
presentation.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yang et al. (1998) created transgenic mice in which varying amounts of a
mutated MYBPC gene, lacking the myosin and titin binding domains, were
expressed in the heart. The transgenically encoded, truncated protein
was stable but was not incorporated efficiently into the sarcomere. The
transgenic muscle fibers showed a leftward shift in the calcium-force
curve and their power output was reduced. Additionally, expression of
the mutant protein led to decreased levels of endogenous myosin-binding
protein C, resulting in a striking pattern of sarcomere disorganization
and dysgenesis.

Yang et al. (1999) generated a second series of transgenic mice
containing a mutant MYBPC gene lacking only the myosin binding site. In
contrast to this group's previous mouse model (see Yang et al. (1998)),
expression of mutant protein was reduced in the heterozygote transgenic
mouse myocardium. Immunofluorescence studies demonstrated correct
incorporation of the mutant protein into the sarcomere, but transmission
electron microscopy revealed marked disorganization of sarcomeric
ultrastructure. Gross cardiac morphology in transgenic mice was also
abnormal, with a globular heart and mild thickening of the left
ventricular free wall and papillary muscle. Functional analysis of
skinned papillary fibers demonstrated reductions in unloaded shortening
velocity, maximum shortening velocity, and relative maximal power
output. This mutant polypeptide appeared to behave in a
dominant-negative fashion.

Meurs et al. (2005) identified a reduction in Mybpc3 protein in
myocardium from Maine Coon cats with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in
comparison to control cats (P less than 0.001). In affected cats, the
authors identified a G-C transversion in exon 3 of the feline Mybpc3
gene, resulting in an ala31-to-pro (A31P) substitution in the linker
region between the C0 and C1 domains. The mutation was predicted to
alter protein conformation and result in sarcomeric disorganization.
Affected cats had some variability of phenotype from mildly affected to
severe hypertrophy. Some cats developed congestive heart failure, and
others died suddenly.

Pohlmann et al. (2007) found that cardiac myocytes from 6-week-old
Mybpc3-null mice exhibited mild hypertrophy that became more pronounced
by 30 weeks of age. Isolated Mybpc3-null myocytes showed markedly lower
diastolic sarcomere length without change in diastolic Ca(2+). This
reduced sarcomere length was partially abolished by inhibition of
actin-myosin ATPase, indicating residual actin-myosin interaction in
diastole. Mybpc3-null myocytes started to contract at lower Ca(2+)
concentration, and both sarcomere shortening and Ca(2+) transients were
prolonged in Mybpc3-null cells. Isolated Mybpc3-null left atria
exhibited a marked increase in sensitivity to external Ca(2+) and, in
contrast to wildtype, continued to develop twitch force at low
micromolar Ca(2+) concentration. Pohlmann et al. (2007) concluded that
MYBPC3 functions as a restraint on myosin-actin interaction at low
Ca(2+) concentrations and short sarcomere length to allow complete
relaxation during diastole.

MYBPC3, IVS, G-C, +5

To determine if mutation of the cardiac MYBPC gene caused CMH in
chromosome 11-linked families (115197), Watkins et al. (1995) amplified
lymphocyte RNA by reverse-transcription and nested PCR. An abnormally
short cDNA in one patient was found to be the result of a G-to-C
transversion at position 5 of the 5-prime splice donor sequence GTGAGC
in the following intron. The G-to-C transversion created a new BstEII
site, allowing independent confirmation of the mutation which was
present in all clinically affected members and not present in unaffected
members (except for 2, who carried a disease-associated haplotype).

MYBPC3, 18-BP DUP

In a family with chromosome 11-linked familial hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (115197), Watkins et al. (1995) demonstrated an 18-bp
tandem duplication of nucleotide residues 3774-3791. Sequencing of the
genomic product confirmed the duplication, which occurred in the
penultimate exon of the coding sequence (denoted exon P). The
duplication was demonstrated in all affected members of the family and
also in a presumed nonpenetrant 16-year-old member. It was not present
in the other unaffected family members or in 200 chromosomes from
unrelated, unaffected individuals.

.0003
CARDIOMYOPATHY, FAMILIAL HYPERTROPHIC, 4
MYBPC3, IVS, A-G

In 2 French kindreds with chromosome 11-linked hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (115197), Bonne et al. (1995) found 2 cDNAs of different
lengths, 336 bp and 196 bp, in affected individuals. Direct sequencing
of the 336 nucleotide product gave 2 different sequences; the normal
cDNA and a cDNA with an 11-bp deletion between nucleotides 1960 and
1970. Sequencing of the 196-bp product gave a cDNA with a 140-bp
deletion between positions 1960 and 2099. Both deletions resulted in a
frameshift followed by a premature stop codon. Studies of genomic DNA
revealed an A-to-G transition at a 3-prime splice acceptor site in
affected individuals. This mutation accounted for both aberrant
transcripts since the 140-bp deletion resulted from skipping the exon
that spans positions 1060 to 2099, while the 11-bp deletion resulted
from the use of a cryptic splice site downstream from the normal splice
site that had been inactivated. The A-to-G transition mutation
introduced a new NlaIV restriction site which was used to screen
affected and unaffected individuals.

CARDIOMYOPATHY, FAMILIAL HYPERTROPHIC, 4
MYBPC3, IVS, G-A, +1

In a family with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy linked to polymorphic
markers on chromosome 11 (115197), Rottbauer et al. (1997) found a
mutation of a splice donor site of the MYBPC gene. The mutation, a
G-to-A transition at position +1 of the donor splice site of exon N,
caused skipping of the associated exon in mRNA from lymphocytes and
myocardium. The skipping of the exon with a consecutive reading
frameshift led to premature termination of translation and was expected
to produce a truncated cardiac myosin-binding protein-C. Western blot
analysis of endomyocardial biopsies from histologically affected left
ventricular myocardium failed to show the expected truncated protein.
The absence of a mutant protein and of significantly reduced amounts of
wildtype protein in the presence of the mutated mRNA argued against the
'poison protein' and the 'null allele' hypotheses and suggested yet
unknown mechanisms relevant to the genesis of chromosome 11-associated
familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

CARDIOMYOPATHY, FAMILIAL HYPERTROPHIC, 4
MYBPC3, IVS7, G-A, +5

One of the 6 new mutations associated with CMH (115197) discovered by
Carrier et al. (1997) in 7 unrelated French families was a G-to-A
transition at position +5 in intron 7. The G residue is highly conserved
at this position in the splice donor consensus sequence. The mutation
resulted in skipping of the 49-bp exon 7 and a frameshift. The aberrant
cDNA encoded 258 normal residues, followed by 25 new amino acids and a
premature termination of translation. This was predicted to produce a
large truncated protein, missing approximately 80% of the normal protein
and lacking the motif containing the phosphorylation sites and the titin
(188840) and myosin (160710)-binding sites.

MYBPC3, GLU542GLN

The second of the 6 new mutations discovered by Carrier et al. (1997) in
7 unrelated French CMH (115197) families was a G-to-C transversion at
position 1656 in exon 17 of the MYBPC3 gene. This was found in 2
families and produced the missense change glu542gln in the C3 domain. In
addition, the mutation affected the last nucleotide of the exon, which
is part of the consensus splicing site. A common feature in human
exon/intron boundaries is that 80% of exons finish with a guanine; this
proportion is 85% in MYBPC3. As a result exon 17 was skipped. The
aberrant cDNA encoded 486 normal residues, leading to a truncated
protein that lacked about 62%, including the titin (188840) and myosin
(160710)-binding sites.

MYBPC3, IVS23, G-A, +1

The third of 6 new mutations discovered by Carrier et al. (1997) in
French CMH (115197) families was a G-to-A transition at position +1 in
the splice donor site of intron 23 that inactivated the splicing site
and produced skipping of the 160-bp exon 23. The mutated cDNA encoded
717 normal residues and then 51 novel amino acids, followed by premature
termination of the translation in the C5 domain. The resulting protein
was predicted to be truncated with a loss of 44%, including the titin
(188840) and myosin (160710)-binding domains.

MYBPC3, BRANCH POINT, IVS23, A-G, TGAT-TGGT

The fourth of the 6 novel mutations discovered by Carrier et al. (1997)
in French CMH (115197) families involved a change from TGAT to TGGT in
intron 23. This A-to-G transition inactivated a potential branch point
consensus sequence (URAY). Although 3 potential branch points existed
upstream from the mutation they did not seem to be used, since analysis
of the transcripts in lymphocytes indicated the existence of 2 aberrant
cDNAs. One corresponded to skipping of the 105-bp exon 24 without
frameshift and encoded a polypeptide depleted of 35 amino acids in the
C6 domain. The other cDNA retained the 724-bp intron 23. The mutant cDNA
was associated with a frameshift; it encoded 770 normal residues and
then 100 novel amino acids, followed by a stop codon, and the
corresponding truncated protein was predicted to be missing 40% of its
structure and should not react with either titin (188840) or myosin
(160710).

MYBPC3, 5-BP DEL, EX25

The fifth the of 6 novel mutations in the MYBPC3 gene discovered by
Carrier et al. (1997) in French CMH (115197) families was a 5-bp
deletion (-GCGTC) in exon 25. The deletion produced a frameshift; the
aberrant cDNA identified in lymphocytes encoded 845 normal residues and
then 35 novel amino acids, followed by premature stop codon in domain C6
that should produce a truncated protein missing 34% and loosing the
C-terminal region containing both the titin (188840)- and myosin
(160710)-binding sites.

MYBPC3, 12-BP DUP/4-BP DEL, EX33

One of the 6 novel mutations in the MYBPC3 gene discovered by Carrier et
al. (1997) in French CMH (115197) families was a 12-bp duplication and a
4-bp deletion in exon 33. This modification introduced a frameshift at
position 3691 that led to 1,220 normal MyBPC residues and then 19 novel
amino acids, followed by a premature stop codon in the last third of the
C10 domain. The predicted truncated protein, lacking 4%, should lose
part of its myosin (160710) binding site.

MYBPC3, 1-BP INS, 2405G

In 115 members of 3 families with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Niimura
et al. (1998) identified a 1-bp insertion in codon 791 (791insG, or
2405insG) in exon 25 of the MYBPC3 gene. Of mutation-positive
individuals who underwent examination, only 1 of 19 less than 20 years
of age had cardiac hypertrophy, whereas 44 of 72 mutation-positive
individuals 20 years old or older had cardiac hypertrophy.

Moolman et al. (2000) reported a large family with hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (CMH4; 115197) with a single base insertion (G) in exon
25 of the MYBPC3 gene. This created a 5-prime splice donor site
(AGGTGGG). Moolman et al. (2000) demonstrated that this mutation
resulted in the loss of 40 basepairs at the 3-prime end of exon 25 in
mRNA extracted from affected myocardium. This in turn led to a premature
translation stop and a truncated protein in which the C-terminal binding
sites for myosin heavy chain and titin were lost. This study also
examined the phenotypic consequences of this mutation in 27 carriers
within the same family. Overall, only 15 (56%) showed features of
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Age of onset of symptoms varied from 29 to
68, with most individuals developing their first symptoms from the
fourth decade onwards. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve for this group
was similar to that of carriers of the asp175-to-asn tropomyosin-1
mutation (191010.0002) and significantly better than that of carriers of
cardiac troponin T2 (191045) or cardiac beta-myosin heavy chain (160760)
mutations. Twelve mutation carriers were entirely asymptomatic and had
no changes on echocardiography or ECG at the time of the study. This
mutation was therefore considered to have considerably reduced
penetrance and delayed onset.

MYBPC3, THR59ALA

In a study of late-onset hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (115197), Niimura
et al. (2002) reported an individual with an A-to-G transition at
nucleotide 206 of the MYBPC3 gene that was predicted to replace the
normal, conserved hydrophilic polar threonine with a hydrophobic
nonpolar alanine at amino acid residue 59 (T59A). The individual had no
family history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

MYBPC3, ASN948THR

In a 40-year-old man diagnosed at the age of 36 years with dilated
cardiomyopathy (CMD1MM; see 615396), Daehmlow et al. (2002) found
heterozygosity for an A-to-C transversion at nucleotide 16575 in exon 27
of the MYBPC3 gene, resulting in an asn948-to-thr (N948T) substitution
at a highly conserved residue. Daehmlow et al. (2002) noted that they
could not confirm the disease-causing nature of this variant because
family members for the calculation of 2-point lod scores could not be
obtained for further investigation.

MYBPC3, GLU1096TER

In a family with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (115197) previously
reported by Hengstenberg et al. (1993, 1994), Richard et al. (1999)
found that of 8 affected members, 2 had a G-to-T mutation at codon 1096
of the MYBPC3 gene, leading to a TAA termination codon (E1096X); 4 had a
G-to-A transition in exon 15 of the MYH7 gene (160760.0033) and 2 were
doubly heterozygous for the 2 mutations. The E1096X mutation was
predicted to produce a truncated protein without the C-terminal domain,
which binds to titin and myosin.

MYBPC3, ARG820GLN

In 16 affected members of 7 families with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
(115197) and in a 71-year-old man with a clinical diagnosis of dilated
cardiomyopathy (see 115200), Konno et al. (2003) identified
heterozygosity for a G-A transition in exon 25 of the MYBPC3 gene,
resulting in an arg820-to-gln (R820Q) substitution at a conserved
residue. The mutation was not found in 6 clinically unaffected family
members or in 100 controls. The authors suggested that the elderly man
with a clinical diagnosis of CMD was in the 'burnt-out' phase of
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; cardiac biopsy showed mild fibrosis, no
myocardial hypertrophy, and no myofibrillar disarray. In a follow-up
study of this patient, Shimizu et al. (2005) stated that it was unclear
whether this patient had 'burnt-out' CMH or had had CMD from the outset.

In a 32-year-old man of Greek Cypriot descent who had mild cardiac
hypertrophy (CMH4; 115197) and severe left ventricular outflow tract
obstruction treated with left ventricular myectomy, Frank-Hansen et al.
(2008) identified heterozygosity for a splice site transition
(1224-19G-A) near exon 14 of the MYBPC3 gene. RT-PCR analysis of
peripheral blood leukocytes from the patient revealed that the mutation
produced a de novo acceptor splice site and extended the transcript by
17 nucleotides, thus introducing a frameshift and premature termination
codon in exon 15. The mutation was also identified in 2 other unrelated
probands, 1 Indian and 1 British, with mild hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,
and was not found in DNA samples from 192 Caucasian controls.

MYBPC3, IVS9, G-C, -1

In a 57-year-old woman with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (CMH4; 115197)
involving asymmetric septal hypertrophy with systolic anterior motion,
Frank-Hansen et al. (2008) identified compound heterozygosity for a
splice site mutation (906-1G-C) near exon 10 of the MYBPC3 gene and a
val1125-to-met (V1125M) substitution (600958.0018). RT-PCR analysis of
peripheral blood leukocytes from the patient revealed that the 906-1G-C
transition disrupted the existing 3-prime splice site and activated a
neighboring cryptic 3-prime splice site positioned 2 nucleotides
downstream, resulting in exclusion of the first 2 bases of exon 10,
producing a frameshift and premature termination codon in exon 12. The
proband's 64-year-old older sister also carried both mutations, and had
asymmetrical septal hypertrophy, right bundle branch block, and left
atrium dilatation; her son, the proband's nephew, who had a borderline
diagnosis of cardiac hypertrophy, was found to carry only the V1125M
mutation. The proband's mother and son carried only the 906-1G-C
mutation; her 94-year-old mother had a borderline diagnosis with T wave
inversion in the lateral leads and abnormal Q waves in the high lateral
leads on electrocardiogram, but a normal echocardiogram; the 26-year-old
son was unaffected, with normal electrocardiogram and echocardiogram.
Neither mutation was found in DNA samples from 192 Caucasian controls.

MYBPC3, IVS32, 25-BP DEL

In a south Indian family with mild hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (CMH4;
115197) and another south Indian family with CMH1 (192600) due to
mutation in the MYH7 gene (160760), Waldmuller et al. (2003) identified
a 25-bp deletion (nt21348-21372) in intron 32 of the MYBPC3 gene,
predicted to cause loss of the splicing branch point. Exon 33 sequences
in processed mRNA were significantly reduced in COS-1 cells and neonatal
rat cardiomyocytes transfected with the deletion but not in cells
transfected with wildtype; however, residual normal splicing was
observed. Noting that the 25-bp deletion was observed in 16 of 229
unrelated Indian controls from Kerala and Tamil Nadu but not in 270
Caucasians from Russia and western Europe, Waldmuller et al. (2003)
suggested that the deletion may represent a regional polymorphism of
southern India and may be a modifier enhancing the phenotypes of
mutations responsible for disease.

Dhandapany et al. (2009) analyzed the 25-bp MYBPC3 deletion in 354
Indian patients with cardiomyopathy and 238 healthy controls and found
an association with cardiomyopathy (odds ratio, 5.3; p = 2 x 10(-6)).
The findings were replicated in 446 cases and 466 controls from 6
independent Indian cohorts (combined odds ratio, 6.99; p = 4 x 10(-11)).
Analysis of RNA and protein from endomyocardial biopsies of 2
heterozygous individuals revealed 2 transcript structures, a normal
transcript and a mutated allele with skipping of the associated exon,
but the altered protein was not detected in tissue samples. Expression
of mutant and wildtype protein in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes
demonstrated a highly disorganized and diffuse pattern of sarcomeric
architecture as a result of aberrant incorporation of the mutant
protein. Dhandapany et al. (2009) concluded that the 25-bp MYBPC3
deletion is associated with a lifelong increased risk of heart failure.

Dhandapany et al. (2009) tested 63 world population samples, comprising
2,085 individuals from 26 countries, for the 25-bp deletion, and they
identified samples heterozygous for the deletion from Pakistan, Sri
Lanka, Indonesia, and Malaysia but not in other samples. Haplotype
analysis determined that the common 25-bp deletion likely arose
approximately 33,000 years ago on the Indian subcontinent.

In 23 Old Order Amish infants with severe neonatal hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (CMH4; 115197), 20 of whom were from the Geauga County
settlement in Ohio, Xin et al. (2007) identified homozygosity for a
3330+2T-G transition in the splice donor site of intron 30 of the MYBPC3
gene, resulting in skipping of the 140-bp exon 30 and causing a
frameshift and premature termination in exon 31. The mutation was found
in heterozygosity in parents. Heterozygous carrier frequency of this
mutation was calculated at 10% in the Geauga County settlement of Ohio.
DNA analysis of a Mennonite couple with a child who had died from CMH
revealed heterozygosity for the same 3330+2T-G mutation.

In a 28-year-old Australian man with familial hypertrophic

heterozygosity for an arg745-to-gly (R745G) substitution in exon 24 of
the MYBPC3 gene and a pro873-to-his (P873H; 600958.0022) substitution in
exon 27 of the MYBPC3 gene. The proband was diagnosed at 18 years of age
and had severe asymmetric septal hypertrophy on echocardiography and
received an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). The proband's
13-year-old son also had severe hypertrophy requiring myectomy on 2
occasions and received an ICD. The proband's father and a brother also
had CMH, but declined to participate in the study. Chiu et al. (2007)
also identified heterozygosity for an R73Q substitution in the CALR3
gene (611414) in this patient and suggested that calreticulin may be
involved in both disease pathogenesis and modification.

In a female infant with fatal cardiomyopathy (CMH4; 115197) who also had
evidence of skeletal myopathy, Tajsharghi et al. (2010) identified
homozygosity for a 2827C-T transition, resulting in an arg943-to-ter
(R943X) substitution in the MYBPC3 gene. Skeletal muscle biopsy at 2
months of age showed pronounced myopathic changes with numerous small
fibers, which all expressed slow/beta-cardiac myosin heavy chain protein
(MYH7; 160760). Electron microscopy revealed disorganization of the
sarcomeres and partial depletion of thick filaments in the small fibers;
immunohistochemical staining showed the presence of cardiac MYBPC in the
small abnormal fibers. RT-PCR and sequencing demonstrated the mutation
in transcripts of skeletal muscle. Tajsharghi et al. (2010) noted that
cardiac MYBPC is not normally expressed in skeletal muscle, and stated
that the reason for the ectopic expression of cardiac MYBPC remained
unknown. The R943X mutation had previously been identified in compound
heterozygosity with other truncating MYBPC3 mutations in 2 unrelated
Dutch infants with fatal hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Lekanne Deprez et
al., 2006); skeletal myopathy was not mentioned in that report.

unrelated CMD probands, but was not found in 246 controls. Haplotype
sharing near the variant suggested a founder mutation. Hershberger et

the MYBPC3 gene (GenBank GENBANK NM_000256.3), resulting in a
gly490-to-arg (G490R) substitution at a highly conserved residue. No
family members were available for segregation analysis. Hershberger et

associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (CMH4; 115197) by Van Driest
et al. (2004) and Morita et al. (2008).

In 2 unrelated white probands of western European descent with left
ventricular noncompaction (LVNC10; see 615396), Probst et al. (2011)
identified heterozygosity for a c.1523G-A transition in exon 18 of the
MYBPC3 gene, resulting in the G490R substitution within the third
cardiac-specific Ig-like domain. One proband was a 70-year-old man who
presented with dyspnea; family screening revealed that his asymptomatic
32-year-old son was also affected. The other proband was a 24-year-old
woman who had been evaluated for syncopal episodes. All 3

In 2 brothers from a consanguineous Chinese family with hypertrophic

homozygosity for a c.1469G-T transversion in exon 17 of the MYBPC3 gene,
resulting in a gly490-to-val (G490V) substitution at a highly conserved
residue. The mutation was present in heterozygosity in their unaffected
parents and 4 other unaffected relatives, none of whom had typical
clinical manifestations of CMH or any abnormalities on
electrocardiography or left ventricular hypertrophy on echocardiography.
The mutation was not found in 376 Chinese controls or in the dbSNP or
1000 Genomes public polymorphism databases. Wang et al. (2013) noted
that a different mutation at the same residue, G490R (600958.0026), had
previously been reported to cause disease in heterozygosity; they
proposed that the difference in inheritance pattern might stem from the
fact that G490R produces a more prominent structural change by
substituting a small side chain for a bulky one and changing the
polarity from neutral to basic, whereas G490V keeps the side chain small
and polarity neutral.

612333	TITLE *612333 PROGRAMMED CELL DEATH 11; PDCD11
;;APOPTOSIS-LINKED GENE 4; ALG4;;
NF-KAPPA-B-BINDING PROTEIN; NFBP;;
KIAA0185
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PDCD11 is a NF-kappa-B (NFKB1; 164011)-binding protein that colocalizes
with U3 RNA (180710) in the nucleolus and is required for rRNA
maturation and generation of 18S rRNA (Sweet et al., 2003; Sweet et al.,
2008).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated myeloid leukemia
cell line cDNA library, Nagase et al. (1996) cloned PDCD11, which they
designated KIAA0185. The deduced protein contains 1,884 amino acids.
Northern blot analysis detected moderate expression in testis and low
expression in placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, spleen,
thymus, ovary, small intestine, colon, and peripheral blood leukocytes.
Expression was weak in heart, brain, and pancreas, and no expression was
detected in prostate.

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of a human astrocytoma cell line cDNA
library using NFKB1 as bait, Sweet et al. (2003) cloned PDCD11, which
they called NFBP. They identified 2 isoforms, which encode a deduced
1,871-amino acid protein and a deduced 131-amino acid NFBP fragment
(NFBPF) corresponding to the NFBP C-terminal region, respectively.
PDCD11 protein contains 7 S1 RNA-binding domains and a histone
acetyltransferase (HAT) repeat and shares 82% and 26% identities with
the mouse Pdcd11 and S. cerevisiae Rrp5 orthologs, respectively.
Northern blot analysis detected a 5.5-kb PDCD11 transcript in several
cell lines and tissues. Immunofluorescence studies localized PDCD11 to
granular aggregates in the nucleus and was confirmed to be nucleolar by
mass spectrometry of proteins isolated from HeLa cell nucleoli.

Lacana and D'Adamio (1999) cloned mouse Pdcd11, which they called Alg4,
using a strategy to identify genes involved in programmed cell death.

GENE FUNCTION

Lacana and D'Adamio (1999) demonstrated that mouse Pcdc11 induced
transcription of Fas ligand (TNFSF6; 134638) leading to apoptosis.

Sweet et al. (2008) showed that PDCD11 colocalized with and
coprecipitated U3 RNA in the nucleolus. Using siRNA knockdown of PDCD11
mRNA, they demonstrated that PDCD11 was required for cleavage and
maturation of rRNA precursor and generation of the 18S rRNA species.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sweet et al. (2003) determined that the PDCD11 gene contains over 35
exons.

MAPPING

By FISH analysis, Sweet et al. (2003) mapped the PDCD11 gene to
chromosome 10q24.2-q25.1.

604447	TITLE *604447 GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE-BINDING PROTEIN, BETA-5; GNB5
;;GB5
DESCRIPTION The beta subunits of the heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G
proteins) are important regulators of G protein alpha subunits as well
as of certain signal transduction receptors and effectors. For
structural information about these proteins, see 600874.

CLONING

Using a degenerate PCR approach to screen a human brain cDNA library,
Jones et al. (1998) cloned the beta-5 subunit, symbolized GNB5, of G
protein. In contrast to beta subunits 1 through 4, which are at least
83% homologous, GNB5 is only 50% homologous to the other beta subunits.
On the other hand, the predicted 353-amino acid protein sequence is
99.4% homologous to the mouse beta-5 protein, with only 2 conservative
amino acid differences. Northern blot analysis revealed that mouse Gnb5
is expressed predominantly in brain (Watson et al., 1994), whereas human
GNB5 is expressed at high levels not only in brain but also in pancreas,
kidney, and heart (Jones et al., 1998), as a major 3.0- and minor 2.0-
and 9.0-kb transcripts. Within the brain, (Jones et al., 1998) detected
highest expression in cerebellum, cerebral cortex, occipital pole,
frontal lobe, temporal lobe, and caudate putamen, and lowest expression
in corpus callosum and spinal cord.

Watson et al. (1996) reported the cloning of a retina-specific cDNA,
termed G-beta-5L, in the mouse, which is identical to GNB5 except for an
additional 126-bp 5-prime exon.

GENE FUNCTION

GNB5 interacts with regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins
containing the G protein gamma-like (GGL) domain: RGS6 (603894), RGS7
(602517), RGS9 (604067), and RGS11 (603895). Chen et al. (2003)
presented data indicating that GNB5 and GGL domain-containing RGS
proteins are obligate partners and supporting the notion that GNB5
functions as a component of the GTPase-accelerating protein (GAP)
complex.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rosskopf et al. (2003) determined that the GNB5 gene contains 12 exons.
The first exon is noncoding and exons 2 and 3 contain alternate ATG
translational start codons.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the GNB5
gene to chromosome 15 (TMAP sts-AA017518).

ANIMAL MODEL

The 'flailer' (flr) mouse exhibits a phenotype consisting of frequent
falling, convulsive limb movements (leg flailing), and ataxia persistent
into adulthood. Jones et al. (2000) determined that the flailer mouse
expresses a novel gene combining the promoter and first 2 exons of Gnb5
with the C-terminal exons of the closely linked myosin-5A (MyoVA) gene
(Myo5a; 160777). Biochemical and genetic studies indicated that the
flailer protein, which is expressed predominantly in brain, competes
with wildtype MyoVA in vivo, preventing the localization of smooth
endoplasmic reticulum vesicles in the dendritic spines of cerebellar
Purkinje cells. The flailer protein thus has a dominant-negative
mechanism of action with a recessive mode of inheritance due to the
dependence of competitive binding on the ratio between mutant and
wildtype proteins. The chromosomal arrangement of Myo5a upstream of Gnb5
is consistent with nonhomologous recombination as the mutational
mechanism.

DESCRIPTION See replication factor C, subunit 2 (RFC2; 600404).

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Bowman et al. (2004) reported the crystal structure of the 5-protein
clamp loader complex (replication factor-C, RFC) of the yeast S.
cerevisiae, bound to the sliding clamp (proliferating cell nuclear
antigen, or PCNA; 176740). Tight interfacial coordination of the ATP
analog ATP-gamma-S by RFC resulted in a spiral arrangement of the ATPase
domains of the clamp loader above the PCNA ring. Placement of a model
for primed DNA within the central hole of PCNA revealed a striking
correspondence between the RFC spiral and the grooves of the DNA double
helix. Bowman et al. (2004) concluded that this model, in which the
clamp loader complex locks into primed DNA in a screwcap-like
arrangement, provides a simple explanation for the process by which the
engagement of primer-template junctions by the RFC:PCNA complex results
in ATP hydrolysis and release of the sliding clamp on DNA.

MAPPING

Okumura et al. (1995) mapped the RFC3 gene to 13q12.3-q13 by PCR
amplification of DNAs from a panel of somatic hybrids and by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

;;NM23H7;;
NUCLEOSIDE DIPHOSPHATE KINASE 7
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In a review of human Nm23/nucleoside diphosphate kinases (EC 2.7.4.6),
Lacombe et al. (2000) stated that the NME7 gene encodes a deduced
376-amino acid protein containing 2 kinase-like domains, each of which
lacks 3 residues deemed crucial for catalysis. RT-PCR detected highest
NME7 expression in testis, and weaker expression in liver, heart, brain,
ovary, small intestine, and spleen.

GENE FUNCTION

Hutchins et al. (2010) showed that mouse Nme7 associated with the
centralspindlin complex (see KIF23, 605064) in transfected HeLa cells.
This complex is believed to have a role in spindle assembly and
cytokinesis.

Lacombe et al. (2000) determined that the NME7 gene contains 12 exons
spanning over 180 kb.

MAPPING

Lacombe et al. (2000) mapped the NME7 gene to chromosome 1q24. They
noted that NME7 and ATP1B1 (182330) lie on opposite strands, with
overlapping 3-prime UTRs.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By homology searches using C. elegans Lin9 as query, Gagrica et al.
(2004) identified human LIN9, and subsequently used RACE PCR to clone a
full-length LIN9 cDNA from HeLa cells. LIN9 encodes a 542-amino acid
protein that contains 2 regions highly conserved between C. elegans Lin9
and 2 Drosophila orthologs (Aly and Twit).

GENE FUNCTION

Using immunofluorescence, Gagrica et al. (2004) showed that LIN9
localizes to the nucleus, and fractionation and crosslinking experiments
showed LIN9 is associated with chromatin. Immunoprecipitation
experiments with GST fusion proteins showed that LIN9 binds via its
amino-terminal portion to RB1 protein (614041) both in vitro and in
vivo. Coexpression of LIN9 with RB protein in Saos-2 cells enhanced the
formation of flat (senescent-like) cells. Transactivation assays with a
panel of incompletely penetrant RB mutants demonstrated that LIN9
enhances RB-dependent transactivation. Using a variety of transformation
assays, Gagrica et al. (2004) showed that LIN9 inhibited oncogenic
transformation of mouse fibroblasts in an RB-dependent manner, and that
inactivation of LIN9 substituted for inactivation of RB protein in the
transformation of human fibroblasts.

By gel filtration of MOLT-4 human T cells, Schmit et al. (2007)
identified LIN9 as a subunit of the over 669-kD LIN complex. Other
stable LIN complex components included LIN37, LIN54 (613367), BMYB
(MYBL2; 601415), and RBAP48 (RBBP4; 602923). All endogenous or
epitope-tagged LIN complex subunits coimmunoprecipitated with one
another, and all were efficiently codepleted together with antibodies
directed to LIN9. The LIN complex associated with E2F (see
189971)-regulated promoters in the T98G human glioblastoma cell line and
was required for activation of G2/M genes. Depletion of LIN complex
subunits had no significant effect on expression of G1/S genes.
