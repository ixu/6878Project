DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

LRP1 is synthesized as a 600-kD precursor transmembrane glycoprotein
that is cleaved in trans-Golgi network by furin (136950) to generate a
515-kD alpha subunit and an 85-kD beta subunit. The alpha and beta
subunits remain noncovalently associated during LRP1 transport to the
cell membrane. LRP1 interacts with a broad range of secreted proteins
and cell surface molecules and mediates their endocytosis and/or
activates signaling pathways through multiple cytosolic adaptor and
scaffold proteins. Phosphorylation of the LRP1 tail regulates ligand
internalization and signal transduction (summary by Deane et al., 2004).

CLONING

Herz et al. (1988) cloned a cDNA for the low density lipoprotein
receptor-related protein (LRP) by virtue of its close homology to the
LDL receptor (606945). The 4,544-amino acid protein contains a single
transmembrane segment. Northern blot analysis detected LRP1 mRNA in
liver, brain, and lung. Kristensen et al. (1990) and Strickland et al.
(1990) demonstrated that LRP is identical to alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M;
103950) receptor (A2MR). Like mannose-6-phosphate receptor (147280), the
A2MR/LRP molecule is probably bifunctional.

In the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, Yochem and Greenwald
(1993) isolated and sequenced a gene more than 23 kb long that encodes a
large integral membrane protein with a predicted structure similar to
that of LRP of mammals. The 4,753-amino acid product predicted for the
C. elegans gene shared a nearly identical number and arrangement of
amino acid sequence motifs with human LRP, and several exons of the C.
elegans LRP gene corresponded to exons of related parts of the human LRP
gene.

Ranganathan et al. (2011) stated that the heavy chain of LRP1 contains 4
clusters of ligand-binding repeats. The light chain includes the
transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic domain, which contains 2 NPxY
motifs and 2 dileucine repeats that contribute to LRP1 endocytosis.
Ranganathan et al. (2011) also purified a soluble form of LRP1 from
human plasma.

MAPPING

Myklebost et al. (1989) mapped the gene for the LRP-related protein to
12q13-q14 by study of DNA from rodent-human cell hybrids and by in situ
hybridization; the symbol APOER was used initially because of the
putative APOE receptor function.

By pulsed field gel analysis, Forus et al. (1991) found that the APR and
GLI genes are closely situated; probes for either gene hybridized to DNA
fragments of molecular weight 300-400 kb. More detailed restriction
analysis showed that the intergenic region was between 200 and 300 kb
(Forus and Myklebost, 1992). Hilliker et al. (1992) confirmed the
assignment to 12q13-q14 using both nonisotopic and isotopic in situ
hybridization. Also by in situ hybridization, they assigned the
corresponding locus to mouse chromosome 15. Binder et al. (2000) pointed
out that gp96 and CD91 both map to the long arm of chromosome 12.

GENE FUNCTION

Herz et al. (1988) found that LRP showed strong calcium binding.

Kounnas et al. (1995) showed that LRP mediates the endocytosis and
degradation of secreted amyloid precursor protein (APP; 104760),
suggesting that a single metabolic pathway links 2 molecules implicated
in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer disease (AD; 104300). Narita et al.
(1997) showed that A2M, via LRP, mediates the clearance and degradation
of APP-generated beta-amyloid (A-beta), the major component of amyloid
plaques in AD.

Kang et al. (2000) demonstrated in vitro that LRP1 is required for the
A2M-mediated clearance of A-beta 40 and 42 via a bona fide
receptor-mediated cellular uptake mechanism. Analysis of postmortem
human brain tissue showed that LRP expression normally declines with
age, and that LRP expression in AD brains was significantly lower than
in controls. Within the AD group, higher LRP levels were correlated with
later age of onset of AD and death. Kang et al. (2000) concluded that
reduced LRP expression is a contributing risk factor for AD, possibly by
impeding the clearance of soluble beta-amyloid.

The heat-shock protein gp96 (TRA1; 191175) is an intracellular protein
capable of chaperoning exogenous antigens from tumors or virus-infected
cells to antigen-presenting cells for presentation through major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I rather than class II molecules,
thereby eliciting CD8 (186910)-positive T-cell responses. Using a mouse
system, Binder et al. (2000) determined that the receptor for gp96 is
CD91 (A2MR) and that A2M, a protein found in blood, inhibits gp96
binding to CD91. They proposed that CD91 acts as a sensor for necrotic
cell death in tissues, leading to proinflammatory immune responses.

Basu et al. (2001) used fluorescence-labeled heat-shock proteins (HSPs)
to show that not only GP96, but also HSP90 (HSPCA; 140571), HSP70 (see
HSPA1A, 140550), and calreticulin (CALR; 109091) use CD91 as a common
receptor. The ability of the cells to bind HSPs correlates with the
proteasome- and TAP (170260)-dependent ability to re-present
HSP-chaperoned peptides.

Forus et al. (1991) found that the APR and GLI (165220) genes are
coamplified in a rhabdomyosarcoma cell line.

Smeijers et al. (2002) showed that murine Lrp1 is a cell surface
receptor for Pseudomonas aeruginosa toxin A.

Wang et al. (2003) demonstrated that tissue plasminogen activator (tPA,
or PLAT; 173370) upregulates MMP9 (120361) in cell culture and in vivo.
MMP9 levels were lower in tPA knockout compared with wildtype mice after
focal cerebral ischemia. In human cerebral microvascular endothelial
cells, MMP9 was upregulated when recombinant tPA was added. RNA
interference suggested that this response was mediated by LRP1, which
avidly binds tPA and possesses signaling properties.

THBS1 (188060) or a peptide of the 19-amino acid active site in its
heparin-binding domain signals focal adhesion disassembly through
interaction with a cell surface form of calreticulin (CRT, or CALR;
109091). Using bovine aortic endothelial cells and wildtype and Lrp -/-
mouse fibroblasts, Orr et al. (2003) showed that Lrp interacted with Crt
and was required to mediate focal adhesion disassembly and downstream
signaling for reorganization of focal adhesions. Binding of the LRP
ligand RAP to purified human LRP inhibited interaction between
recombinant human CRT and LRP.

Deane et al. (2004) found that wildtype A-beta 40 bound immobilized LRP
with higher affinity than A-beta 42 or mutant A-beta 40 due to the lower
beta sheet content of wildtype A-beta 40 compared with the other
molecules. Lrp at mouse brain capillaries mediated clearance of wildtype
A-beta 40 across the blood-brain barrier at a rate much higher than
those for A-beta 42 and mutant A-beta 40. In primary human brain
endothelial capillaries in culture, high concentrations of all A-beta
species reduced LRP content via degradation in proteasomes. Loss of the
LRP-binding protein Rap (LRPAP1; 104225) in Rap -/- mice reduced brain
capillary clearance of all A-beta species. Expression of LRP was reduced
in AD and Dutch-type cerebrovascular beta-amyloidosis (605714) brain
tissue, suggesting that inadequate LRP-mediated A-beta clearance
contributes to the formation of neurotoxic A-beta oligomers and
progressive neuronal dysfunction.

The cysteine-rich extracellular domains (CRDs) of frizzled proteins (see
FZ1, or FZD1; 603408) function as Wnt (see WNT3A; 606359) receptors.
Using transfected HEK293 cells, Zilberberg et al. (2004) showed that
LRP1 or a C-terminal fragment of LRP1 containing the fourth cluster of
ligand-binding repeats, the transmembrane domain, and the cytoplasmic
tail bound the CRD of human FZ1 and inhibited FZ1-dependent Wnt
signaling. LRP1 did not mediate FZ1 internalization and degradation, but
sequestered FZ1 and inhibited its formation of a functional Wnt
signaling complex with LRP6 (603507).

Since BACE1 (604252) and APP interact and traffic with one another, and
APP interacts with and traffics with LRP1, von Arnim et al. (2005)
investigated interactions between BACE1 and LRP1. They found that BACE1
interacted with the light chain of LRP1 on the cell surface in
association with lipid rafts. The BACE-LRP1 interaction led to increased
LRP1 extracellular domain cleavage and subsequent release of the LRP1
intracellular domain from the membrane. Von Arnim et al. (2005)
concluded that LRP1 is a BACE1 substrate.

Kinchen et al. (2005) showed that in C. elegans, CED1 (LRP1), CED6 (see
608165), and CED7 (see 601615) are required for actin reorganization
around the apoptotic cell corpse, and that CED1 and CED6 colocalize with
each other and with actin around the dead cell. Furthermore, Kinchen et
al. (2005) found that the CED10 (RAC1; 602048) GTPase acts genetically
downstream of these proteins to mediate corpse removal, functionally
linking the 2 engulfment pathways and identifying the CED1, CED6, and
CED7 signaling module as upstream regulators of Rac activation.

Using knockout mice, Liu et al. (2007) found that expression of Lrp1 was
elevated following deletion of App, its homolog Aplp2 (104776), or
components of the App-processing gamma-secretase complex (see 104311).
Lrp1 expression was also elevated following inhibition of
gamma-secretase activity. Elevated Lrp1 mRNA and protein was accompanied
by increased catabolism of Apoe (107741) and cholesterol. Reporter gene
assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that the App
intracellular domain (AICD), which is released along with A-beta by
gamma-secretase activity, bound the Lrp1 promoter together with Fe65
(APBB1; 602709) and Tip60 (KAT5; 601409) and suppressed Lrp1 expression.

Gaultier et al. (2008) found that Schwann cells in injured rodent nerve
exhibited increased expression of Lrp1. A soluble fragment of Lrp1 with
an intact alpha chain (sLrp-alpha) was shed by Schwann cells in vitro
and in the peripheral nervous system after injury. Injection of purified
sLrp-alpha into mouse sciatic nerves prior to chronic constriction
injury inhibited p38 Mapk (MAPK14; 600289) activation and decreased
expression of Tnf-alpha (191160) and Il1-beta (147720) locally.
sLrp-alpha also inhibited injury-induced spontaneous neuropathic pain
and decreased inflammatory cytokine expression in the spinal dorsal
horn, where neuropathic pain processing occurs. In cultured rat Schwann
cells, astrocytes, and microglia, sLrp-alpha inhibited Tnf-alpha-induced
activation of p38 Mapk and Erk/Mapk.

The cell surface receptor CED1 mediates apoptotic cell recognition by
phagocytic cells, enabling cell corpse clearance in C. elegans. Chen et
al. (2010) found that the C. elegans intracellular protein sorting
complex, retromer, was required for cell corpse clearance by mediating
the recycling of CED1. The mammalian retromer complex contains sorting
nexins 1/2 (601272, 605929) (C. elegans homolog snx1) and 5/6 (605937,
606098) (C. elegans homolog snx6). Retromer was recruited to the
surfaces of phagosomes containing cell corpses, and its loss of function
caused defective cell corpse removal. The retromer probably acted
through direct interaction with CED1 in the cell corpse recognition
pathway. In the absence of retromer function, CED1 associated with
lysosomes and failed to recycle from phagosomes and cytosol to the
plasma membrane. Thus, Chen et al. (2010) concluded that retromer is an
essential mediator of apoptotic cell clearance by regulating phagocytic
receptor(s) during cell corpse engulfment.

Ranganathan et al. (2011) noted that previous work (Cao et al., 2006)
had shown colocalization of LRP1 with integrin alpha-M (ITGAM;
120980)/beta-2 (ITGB2; 600065) at the trailing edge of migrating
macrophages and that macrophage migration depended upon coordinated
action of LRP1 and alpha-M/beta-2, as well as tissue plasminogen
activator and its inhibitor, PAI1 (SERPINE1; 173360). Ranganathan et al.
(2011) found that LRP1 specifically bound integrin alpha-M/beta-2, but
not the homologous receptor integrin alpha-L (ITGAL; 153370)/beta-2.
Activation of alpha-M/beta-2 by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) enhanced
interaction between LRP1 and alpha-M/beta-2 in macrophages. Transfection
experiments in HEK293 cells revealed that both the heavy and light
chains of LRP1 contributed to alpha-M/beta-2 binding. Within the LRP1
heavy chain, binding was mediated primarily via ligand-binding motifs 2
and 4. Within alpha-M, the sequence EQLKKSKTL within the I domain was
the major LRP1 recognition site. Exposure of alpha-M/beta-2-expressing
HEK293 cells to soluble LRP1 inhibited cell attachment to fibrinogen
(see 134820). Mouse macrophages lacking Lrp1 were deficient in
alpha-M/beta-2 internalization upon LPS stimulation. Ranganathan et al.
(2011) concluded that LRP1 has a role in macrophage migration and that
it is critical for internalization of integrin alpha-M/beta-2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Association with Alzheimer disease

The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein gene was an
attractive candidate for Alzheimer disease (AD) for several reasons. The
multifunctional LRP had been shown to function as a receptor for the
uptake of apolipoprotein E-containing lipoprotein particles by neurons.
The apoE4 (107741) allele is strongly associated with an increased risk
of late-onset familial Alzheimer disease and both late-onset and
early-onset sporadic AD. The LRP receptor is prominently located in the
soma regions and proximal processes of neurons. In a case-control study
of 183 familial and sporadic AD patients and 118 controls, Lendon et al.
(1997) found a moderate association (odds ratio = 1.57, p = 0.024)
between AD and the 87-bp allele of a tetranucleotide repeat polymorphism
located 5-prime to the LRP1 gene. Furthermore, Pericak-Vance et al.
(1997) found in a genomic screen and follow-up analysis of 54 late-onset
AD families, 4 regions potentially harboring AD genes; one of these
regions, on chromosome 12, was located about 10 cM proximal of LRP1.
Scott et al. (1998) examined 144 late-onset multiplex AD families, 436
sporadic AD cases, and 240 controls and found no evidence of linkage or
association of LRP1 and AD. Their data indicated that genetic variation
in the LRP1 gene is not a major risk factor in the etiology of Alzheimer
disease.

Among 157 patients with late-onset AD (85 with a family history and 72
without a family history), Kang et al. (1997) found increased frequency
of the C allele of a 766C-T polymorphism in exon 3 of the LRP1 gene
compared to controls, although the C allele was common in controls. The
authors suggested that the polymorphism, predicted to be silent, may be
in linkage disequilibrium with a putative nearby AD susceptibility
locus. Studies by Hollenbach et al. (1998) and Baum et al. (1998) also
provided evidence of increased frequency of the 766C allele in patients
with AD. McIlroy et al. (2001) found no association with the exon 3
polymorphism and development of AD.

Kang et al. (2000) noted that LRP and its ligands, APOE and
alpha-2-macroglobulin, are all genetically associated with AD.

Bian et al. (2005) investigated the potential genetic contribution of 4
polymorphisms in LRP1 to AD in the Han Chinese population by studying
216 late-onset AD patients and 200 control subjects. The LRP1 CTCG
haplotype (exon 3 T/C; intron 6 T/C, dbSNP rs2306692; exon 22 T/C;
intron 83 A/G, dbSNP rs1800164) was overrepresented in the control group
(p = 0.002). This difference was still statistically significant in the
APOE4-negative subjects (p = 0.003), indicating that the CTCG haplotype
of LRP1 may reduce the risk for late-onset AD.

gene and abdominal aortic aneurysm, see AAA4 (614375).

ANIMAL MODEL

Boucher et al. (2003) developed tissue-specific knockout mice that
lacked Lrp1 only in vascular smooth muscle cells. To increase
susceptibility to spontaneous atherosclerotic lesion development, these
animals were crossed to LDL receptor (Ldlr; 606945) knockout mice to
generate Ldlr-/smooth muscle Lrp- mice. The presence or absence of Lrp1
expression in smooth muscle cells had no effect on plasma cholesterol or
triglyceride levels in mice on normal chow or an atherogenic
high-cholesterol diet. However, aortas from smooth muscle Lrp- mice were
consistently distended and dilated. This difference increased over time
and was accompanied by thickening of the aortic wall, pronounced
atherosclerosis, and aneurysm formation. Boucher et al. (2003) showed
that Lrp1 forms a complex with the PDGF receptor (see PDGFR1, 173410).
Inactivation of Lrp1 in vascular smooth muscle cells of mice caused
PDGFR overexpression and abnormal activation of PDGFR signaling,
resulting in disruption of the elastic layer, smooth muscle cell
proliferation, aneurysm formation, and marked susceptibility to
cholesterol-induced atherosclerosis. The development of these
abnormalities was reduced by treatment with Gleevec, an inhibitor of
PDGF signaling. Thus, Boucher et al. (2003) concluded that LRP1 has a
pivotal role in protecting vascular wall integrity and preventing
atherosclerosis by controlling PDGFR activation.

May et al. (2004) found that mice with targeted disruption of the Lrp1
gene in differentiated postmitotic neurons demonstrated hyperactivity
and constant tremor, and later developed dystonic posturing with
increased thoracic kyphosis, waddling gait, and hindlimb weakness,
suggesting motoneuronal disinhibition or motor excitation. The
transgenic mice died prematurely at about 9 months of age. Brain
morphology was normal with no major neuronal loss, suggesting a
functional abnormality in neurotransmission. In vitro, LRP1
coimmunoprecipitated and colocalized with the postsynaptic protein PSD95
(602887) and the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits NR2A
(138253) and NR2B (138252). Treatment of neurons with NMDA reduced the
interaction of Lrp1 and Psd95. May et al. (2004) concluded that LRP1
plays a role in behavior and motor function by regulating postsynaptic
signaling mechanisms through interaction with NMDA receptors.

Hofmann et al. (2007) generated mice with adipocyte-specific
inactivation of LRP1 and observed delayed postprandial lipid clearance,
reduced body weight, smaller fat stores, lipid-depleted brown
adipocytes, improved glucose tolerance, and elevated energy expenditure
due to enhanced muscle thermogenesis. In addition, the mutant mice were
resistant to dietary fat-induced obesity and glucose intolerance.
Hofmann et al. (2007) concluded that LRP1 is a critical regulator of
adipocyte energy homeostasis.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
LRP1, HIS3258GLN

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to intellectual disability has not been confirmed.

In a boy who developed seizures and developmental stagnation at age 22
months and ultimately had severe intellectual disability with an IQ of
34, stereotypic behavior, high pain threshold, and sleep disturbances
with a normal brain MRI and no dysmorphic features, de Ligt et al.
(2012) identified a de novo heterozygous 9774C-G transversion resulting
in a his3258-to-gln (H3258Q) substitution.
