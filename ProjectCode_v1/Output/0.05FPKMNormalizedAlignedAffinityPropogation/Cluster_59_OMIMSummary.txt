;;GKRP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Glucokinase (GCK; 138079) in the liver and pancreatic beta cells is
subject to inhibition by a regulatory protein, GCKR. The inhibitory
effect of GCKR depends on the presence of fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) and
is antagonized by fructose-1-phosphate (F1P). Warner et al. (1995) noted
that mutations in GCKR might be diabetogenic if they resulted in the
synthesis of proteins with increased inhibitory activity, perhaps
reflecting increased sensitivity to fructose-6-phosphate or reduced
susceptibility to antagonism by fructose-1-phosphate. Warner et al.
(1995) determined the complete sequence of human GCKR cDNA. The GCKR
cDNA encodes a protein of 625 amino acids. Given the role of glucokinase
in the causation of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) type II
(125851), GCKR had been considered a candidate gene for a form of MODY.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hayward et al. (1998) determined that the GCKR gene contains 19 exons
and spans 27 kb.

MAPPING

Warner et al. (1995) isolated YAC clones containing human GCKR and
localized them to chromosome 2p23 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.
Vaxillaire et al. (1994) had previously assigned the GCKR gene to
chromosome 2p23-p22.3.

Hayward et al. (1996) demonstrated that the GCKR gene lies within 500 kb
of the gene encoding ketohexokinase (229800). By high-resolution
fluorescence in situ hybridization, they refined the localization of the
GCKR gene to chromosome 2p23.3-p23.2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

A common GCKR variant (P446L; dbSNP rs1260326; 600842.0001) is
associated with triglyceride and fasting plasma glucose levels (FGQTL5;
613463) in the general population. In a series of transfection
experiments using wildtype and P446L-GKRP, Beer et al. (2009) reported
reduced regulation by physiologic concentrations of F6P in the presence
of P446L-GKRP, resulting indirectly in increased GCK activity. Assays
matched for GKRP activity demonstrated no difference in dose-dependent
inhibition of GCK activity or F1P-mediated regulation. Quantitative
RT-PCR analysis showed that GCKR is highly expressed relative to GCK in
human liver and has very low expression in human pancreatic islets
relative to GCK. The authors noted that altered GCK regulation in liver
is predicted to enhance glycolytic flux, promoting hepatic glucose
metabolism and elevating concentrations of malonyl-CoA (a substrate for
de novo lipogenesis). Beer et al. (2009) proposed this as a mutational
mechanism for the association of the leu446 allele with raised
triglycerides and lower glucose levels.

Suhre et al. (2011) reported a comprehensive analysis of
genotype-dependent metabolic phenotypes using a GWAS with nontargeted
metabolomics. They identified 37 genetic loci associated with blood
metabolite concentrations, of which 25 showed effect sizes that were
unusually high for GWAS and accounted for 10 to 60% differences in
metabolite levels per allele copy. These associations provided new
functional insights for many disease-related associations that had been
reported in previous studies, including those for cardiovascular and
kidney disorders, type 2 diabetes, cancer, gout, venous thromboembolism,
and Crohn disease. Suhre et al. (2011) identified dbSNP rs780094 in the
GCKR gene as associated with glucose/mannose ratio with a p value value
of 5.5 x 10(-53).

ANIMAL MODEL

To further understand the role of glucokinase regulatory protein, which
they symbolized GKRP, Farrelly et al. (1999) inactivated the mouse
homolog. With the knockout of the mouse gene, there was a parallel loss
of glucokinase protein and activity in mutant mouse liver. The loss was
primarily because of posttranscriptional regulation of glucokinase,
indicating a positive regulatory role for GKRP in maintaining
glucokinase levels and activity. As in rat hepatocytes, both glucokinase
and GKRP were localized in the nuclei of mouse hepatocytes cultured in
low glucose-containing medium. In the presence of fructose or high
concentrations of glucose, conditions known to relieve glucokinase
inhibition by GKRP in vitro, only glucokinase was translocated into the
cytoplasm. In the GKRP-mutant hepatocytes, glucokinase was not found in
the nucleus under any tested conditions. Farrelly et al. (1999) proposed
that GKRP functions as an anchor to sequester and inhibit glucokinase in
the hepatocyte nucleus, where it is protected from degradation. This
ensures that glucose phosphorylation is minimal when the liver is in the
fasting, glucose-producing phase. This also enables the hepatocytes
rapidly to mobilize glucokinase into the cytoplasm to phosphorylate and
store or metabolize glucose after the ingestion of dietary glucose. In
GKRP-mutant mice, the disruption of this regulation and the subsequent
decrease in GK activity led to altered glucose metabolism and impaired
glycemic control.

Grimsby et al. (2000) found that wildtype and Gckr-null mice had
comparable glucokinase activity at physiologic glucose concentrations.
However, following a glucose tolerance test, the homozygous knockout
mice showed impaired glucose clearance, indicating that they could not
recruit sufficient glucokinase due to the absence of a nuclear reserve.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
FASTING PLASMA GLUCOSE LEVEL QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCUS 5
GCKR, PRO446LEU (dbSNP rs1260326)

Beer et al. (2009) noted that the 1403C-T transition (dbSNP rs1260326)
in the GCKR gene results in a pro446-to-leu (P446L) substitution at a
conserved residue in the glucokinase regulatory protein. Residue 446
lies between 2 motifs thought to be directly involved in binding of
phosphate esters.

By genomewide association studies, Orho-Melander et al. (2008) showed
that the intronic dbSNP rs780094 variant of the GCKR gene was associated
with higher plasma triglyceride levels (p = 3 x 10(-56)) but lower
fasting plasma glucose levels (p = 1 x 10(-13)) (FGQTL5; 613463).
Fine-mapping by genotyping and imputing SNPs across the GCKR locus
identified a common 1403C-T transition, resulting in a pro446-to-leu
(P446L; dbSNP rs1260326) substitution, as the strongest signal for
association with triglycerides. The dbSNP rs1260326 SNP shows strong
linkage disequilibrium (r(2) = 0.93) with dbSNP rs780094 and has a minor
allele frequency of 0.34.

In 4,833 middle-aged French individuals, Vaxillaire et al. (2008) found
that the minor T allele of the P446L (dbSNP rs1260326) SNP was strongly
associated with lower fasting glucose levels and fasting insulin levels,
and conversely, higher triglyceride levels.

Dupuis et al. (2010) performed metaanalyses of 21 genomewide association
studies informative for fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and indices of
beta-cell function (HOMA-B) and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in up to
46,186 nondiabetic participants. Follow-up of 25 loci in up to 76,558
additional subjects identified 16 loci associated with fasting glucose
and HOMA-B and 2 loci associated with fasting insulin and HOMA-IR.
Dupuis et al. (2010) identified association of elevation of fasting
blood glucose (p = 5.6 x 10(-38)) and decreased triglyceride levels (p =
9.6 x 10(-17)) with the C allele of the intronic C-T SNP (dbSNP
rs780094) in the GCKR gene on chromosome 2p23.3-p23.2. This variant was
also associated with fasting insulin levels (3.0 x 10(-24)).

In a series of transfection experiments using wildtype and P446L-GKRP,
Beer et al. (2009) reported reduced regulation by physiologic
concentrations of F6P in the presence of P446L-GKRP, resulting
indirectly in increased GCK activity. Assays matched for GKRP activity
demonstrated no difference in dose-dependent inhibition of GCK activity
or F1P-mediated regulation. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that
GCKR is highly expressed relative to GCK in human liver and has very low
expression in human pancreatic islets relative to GCK. The authors noted
that altered GCK regulation in liver is predicted to enhance glycolytic
flux, promoting hepatic glucose metabolism and elevating concentrations
of malonyl-CoA (a substrate for de novo lipogenesis). Beer et al. (2009)
proposed this as a mutational mechanism for the association of the
leu446 allele with raised triglycerides and lower glucose levels.

190170	TITLE *190170 TRANSFORMING GROWTH FACTOR, ALPHA; TGFA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Transforming growth factors (TGFs) are biologically active polypeptides
that reversibly confer the transformed phenotype on cultured cells.
TGF-alpha shows about 40% sequence homology with epidermal growth factor
(EGF; 131530) and competes with EGF for binding to the EGF receptor
(131550), stimulating its phosphorylation and producing a mitogenic
response.

GENE STRUCTURE

Collin et al. (1999) determined the exon-intron structure of the TGFA
gene and excluded it as a candidate for Alstrom syndrome (203800).

MAPPING

Brissenden et al. (1985) used a human genomic DNA clone to map the TGFA
locus to chromosome 2p13-2p11 in somatic cell hybrids with confirmation
by in situ hybridization. They commented on the possible significance of
the fact that in Burkitt lymphoma with 2;8 translocation, the breakpoint
is at chromosome 2p13-p11. Thus, t(2;8) might place TGFA near the MYC
oncogene. Tricoli et al. (1985, 1986) likewise assigned TGFA to
chromosome chromosome 2p13 by in situ hybridization. Fowler et al.
(1993) demonstrated that the murine Tgfa gene is linked to Igkc
(147200), Fabp1 (134650), and Ly-2 (CD8A; 186910) on chromosome 6.

GENE FUNCTION

Ellis et al. (1987) presented evidence that TGFA plays a role in certain
paraneoplastic manifestations of melanoma: the sign of Leser-Trelat (the
sudden appearance of, or increase in the number and size of, seborrheic
keratoses), acanthosis nigricans, and eruptive acrochordons (sudden
onset of multiple skin tags).

Fernandez-Larrea et al. (1999) used the 2-hybrid screen to identify
pro-TGF-alpha cytoplasmic domain-binding proteins, which they referred
to as TACIPs (pro-TGF-alpha cytoplasmic domain-interacting proteins),
involved in the trafficking of pro-TGF-alpha. They cloned 2 such
proteins, which they designated TACIP1 (601017) and TACIP18 (602217).

The circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus is thought to drive
daily rhythms of behavior by secreting factors that act locally within
the hypothalamus. In a systematic screen, Kramer et al. (2001)
identified TGFA as a likely suprachiasmatic nucleus inhibitor of
locomotion. TGFA is expressed rhythmically in the suprachiasmatic
nucleus, and when infused into the third ventricle it reversibly
inhibited locomotor activity and disrupted circadian sleep-wake cycles.
These actions were mediated by EGF receptors on neurons in the
hypothalamic subparaventricular zone. Mice with a hypomorphic EGF
receptor mutation exhibited excessive daytime locomotor activity and
failed to suppress activity when exposed to light. Kramer et al. (2001)
concluded that their results implicate EGF receptor signaling in the
daily control of locomotor activity. They identified a neural circuit in
the hypothalamus that likely mediates the regulation of behavior both by
the suprachiasmatic nucleus and the retina using TGFA and EGF receptors
in the retinohypothalamic tract.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

orofacial clefting, see OFC2 (602966).

;;HEPARAN GLUCOSAMINYL N-DEACETYLASE/N-SULFOTRANSFERASE 1;;
HEPARAN SULFATE N-DEACETYLASE/N-SULFOTRANSFERASE; HSST
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NDST1 belongs to a family of bifunctional enzymes involved in heparan
sulfate biosynthesis (Aikawa et al., 2001).

CLONING

Dixon et al. (1995) cloned a human heparan sulfate
N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase cDNA from a placenta library using a
cosmid from the Treacher Collins syndrome (154500) candidate region on
chromosome 5q32-q33.1. They detected 2 different mRNAs that vary in the
length of their 3-prime untranslated regions but encode the same
protein. The sequence predicts an 882-amino acid protein that is 98%
identical to the rat protein (Hashimoto et al., 1995).

Aikawa et al. (2001) cloned mouse Ndst1, which encodes a deduced
872-amino acid protein. RT-PCR detected variable Ndst1 expression in all
adult mouse tissues examined and in whole mouse embryos at all
developmental stages examined.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gladwin et al. (1996) determined that the HSST gene contains 14 exons.

MAPPING

The Treacher Collins Syndrome Collaborative Group (1996) stated that the
most 5-prime exon of the HSST gene lies approximately 150 kb distal to
TREACLE (606847), the gene responsible for Treacher Collins syndrome, on
chromosome 5q32-q33.1.

GENE FUNCTION

Using N-acetylheparosan purified from E. coli capsular polysaccharide as
substrate, Aikawa et al. (2001) found that recombinant mouse Ndst
enzymes showed distinct ratios of N-acetylglucosamine N-deacetylase to
N-sulfotransferase activities. Ndst1 had higher sulfotransferase
activity than deacetylation activity against this substrate.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Gladwin et al. (1996) excluded mutations within the coding sequence and
adjacent splice junctions of HSST from a causative role in the
pathogenesis of Treacher Collins syndrome.

EVOLUTION

Aikawa et al. (2001) determined that 3 gene duplication events likely
occurred to give rise to the 4 vertebrate NDST genes. They proposed that
after the initial gene duplication event, a duplication produced NDST1
and NDST2 (603268), followed by a much later duplication that produced
NDST3 (603950) and NDST4 (615039).

ANIMAL MODEL

Fan et al. (2000) found that Ndst1-null mice developed respiratory
distress and atelectasis that subsequently caused neonatal death.
Morphologic examination revealed type II pneumocyte immaturity, which
was characterized by an increased glycogen content and a reduced number
of lamellar bodies and microvilli. Biochemical analysis indicated that
both total phospholipids and desaturated phosphatidylcholine were
reduced in the mutant lung.

606112	TITLE *606112 RIBONUCLEASE P, 14-KD SUBUNIT; RPP14
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ribonuclease P (RNase P) removes the 5-prime leader sequences from
precursor tRNA molecules. RNase P consists of an RNA species (H1 RNA),
the POP1 protein (602486), and at least 7 proteins called RPPs. The RPPs
have apparent molecular masses of 14 kD (RPP14), 20 kD (RPP20; 606113),
25 kD (RPP25), 29 kD (RPP29; 606114), 30 kD (RPP30; 606115), 38 kD
(RPP38; 606116), and 40 kD (RPP40; 606117). Patients with scleroderma
(181750) have serum reactive with RNase P, the Th antigen, which is also
referred to as the To antigen, and RPP30 and RPP38 (summary by Jarrous
et al., 1998, 1999).

CLONING

By biochemical purification of RNase P, micropeptide sequence analysis,
and EST database searching, Jarrous et al. (1999) obtained a cDNA
encoding RPP14. The deduced basic protein has 124 amino acids and a
predicted molecular mass of nearly 14 kD. Immunoblot analysis showed
that antibodies to RPP14 or RPP29 precipitate native RNase P.

MAPPING

Gross (2013) mapped the RPP14 gene to chromosome 3p14.3 based on an
alignment of the RPP14 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF001175) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;ONCOGENE INT4; INT4
MOUSE MAMMARY TUMOR VIRUS INTEGRATION SITE 4, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Roelink et al. (1993) used mouse Wnt3 sequences as a probe to isolate a
genomic clone of the human homolog, WNT3. Comparison of the deduced
mouse and human WNT3 protein sequences showed 4 changes in 333 amino
acids.

Using ribonuclease protection analysis, Huguet et al. (1994)
investigated expression of WNT genes, including WNT3, in human cell
lines, as well as in normal, benign, and malignant breast tissue. They
detected WNT3 in breast cell lines and in breast tissue.

MAPPING

Rider et al. (1989) assigned the INT4 gene to 17q21-q22 using a DNA
probe in the study of a panel of chromosome-mediated gene transfectants
and conventional hybrids, in particular those with well-defined breaks
on human chromosome 17. In situ hybridization was performed for more
precise localization. The mouse MMTV integration site int4 was mapped to
mouse chromosome 11 in a region homologous to the region of human
chromosome 17 carrying the INT4 locus.

Roelink et al. (1993) localized the WNT3 gene to 17q21 by isotopic in
situ hybridization.

GENE FUNCTION

Several studies had implicated Wnt signaling in primary axis formation
during vertebrate embryogenesis, yet no Wnt protein had been shown to be
essential for this process. In the mouse, primitive streak formation is
the first overt morphologic sign of the anterior-posterior axis in
mesoderm. Liu et al. (1999) generated Wnt3 -/- mice by targeted
disruption of the mouse Wnt3 gene. Wnt3 -/- mice developed a normal egg
cylinder but did not form a primitive streak, mesoderm, or node. The
epiblast continued to proliferate in an undifferentiated state that
lacked anterior-posterior neural patterning, but anterior visceral
endoderm markers were expressed and correctly positioned. Liu et al.
(1999) concluded that regional patterning of the visceral endoderm is
independent of primitive streak formation, but the subsequent
establishment of anterior-posterior neural pattern in the ectoderm is
dependent on derivatives of the primitive streak. Their studies provided
genetic proof for the requirement of Wnt3 in primary axis formation in
the mouse.

Krylova et al. (2002) investigated the role of Wnt proteins in the
formation of the sensorimotor connections in the mouse spinal cord.
Using in situ hybridization, they detected Wnt3 gene expression in
motoneurons of the lateral motor column at a time when sensory axons
make contact with them. In neuronal cultures, Wnt3 increased branching
and growth cone size while inhibiting axonal extension in axons
responsive to neurotrophin-3 (Ntf3; 162660), but not in axons responsive
to nerve growth factor (NGF). In explant cultures, the ventral spinal
cord secreted factors with Wnt3-like axonal remodeling activity that was
blocked by Sfrp1 (604156), a Wnt antagonist. Krylova et al. (2002)
concluded that WNT3 acts as a retrograde branching and stop signal for
muscle afferents during the formation of sensorimotor circuits in the
spinal cord.

Lie et al. (2005) demonstrated that adult hippocampal stem/progenitor
cells (AHPs) express receptors and signaling components for Wnt
proteins, which are key regulators of neural stem behavior in embryonic
development. Lie et al. (2005) also showed that the Wnt/beta-catenin
(116806) pathway is active and that Wnt3 is expressed in the hippocampal
neurogenic niche. Overexpression of Wnt3 was sufficient to increase
neurogenesis from AHPs in vitro and in vivo. By contrast, blockade of
Wnt signaling reduced neurogenesis from AHPs in vitro and abolished
neurogenesis almost completely in vivo. Lie et al. (2005) concluded that
their data showed that Wnt signaling is a principal regulator of adult
hippocampal neurogenesis and provided evidence that Wnt proteins have a
role in adult hippocampal function.

Schmitt et al. (2006) found that Wnt3 is expressed in a medial-lateral
decreasing gradient in chick optic tectum and mouse superior colliculus.
Retinal ganglion cell axons from different dorsal-ventral positions
showed graded and biphasic response to Wnt3 in a concentration-dependent
manner. Wnt3 repulsion is mediated by Ryk (600524), expressed in a
ventral-to-dorsal decreasing gradient, whereas attraction of dorsal
axons at lower Wnt3 concentrations is mediated by Frizzled(s) (see
603408). Overexpression of Wnt3 in the lateral tectum repelled the
termination zones of dorsal retinal ganglion cell axons in vivo.
Expression of a dominant-negative Ryk in dorsal retinal ganglion cell
axons caused a medial shift of the termination zones, promoting medially
directed interstitial branches and eliminating laterally directed
branches. Therefore, Schmitt et al. (2006) concluded that a classic
morphogen, Wnt3, acting as an axon guidance molecule, plays a role in
retinotectal mapping along the medial-lateral axis, counterbalancing the
medial-directed EphrinB1-EphB (see 300035) activity.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 4 affected fetuses of a consanguineous Turkish family with autosomal
recessive tetraamelia (273395), Niemann et al. (2004) identified a
homozygous nonsense mutation in the WNT3 gene (165330.0001). Based on
the phenotypic findings in the affected patients, Niemann et al. (2004)
concluded that WNT3 is required at the early stages of limb formation,
as well as for craniofacial and urogenital development.

NOMENCLATURE

For the group of related genes of which the first to be discovered was
INT1 (164820), Nusse et al. (1991) suggested the designation Wnt
(pronounced 'wint'), a mnemonic for the 'wingless' homolog. The product
INT1 (renamed WNT1) encodes a novel secretory glycoprotein similar to
the product of the Drosophila melanogaster 'wingless' gene. The INT4
locus was renamed WNT3.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
TETRAAMELIA, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
WNT3, GLN83TER

In 4 affected fetuses of a consanguineous Turkish family with autosomal
recessive tetraamelia (273395), Niemann et al. (2004) identified a
homozygous 366C-T transition in the WNT3 gene, resulting in a
gln83-to-ter (Q83X) mutation. The mutation was predicted to result in a
truncated protein of only 82 amino acids. Hence, loss of function of
both copies of WNT3 is the most likely pathogenic mechanism in these
patients.

607300	TITLE *607300 PRECURSOR mRNA-PROCESSING FACTOR 8, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; PRPF8
;;PRP8;;
PRPC8;;
U5 snRNP-SPECIFIC PROTEIN, 220-KD
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PRPF8 is a component of mammalian spliceosomes, large multiprotein
complexes involved in the removal of introns from mRNA precursors
(summary by Luo et al., 1999).

CLONING

By searching EST databases using yeast and nematode Prp8, screening a
HeLa cell cDNA library, and 5-prime RACE of a placenta cDNA library, Luo
et al. (1999) cloned a full-length cDNA encoding PRP8. The deduced
2,335-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 274 kD.
Overall, PRP8 shares 86% identity with the nematode protein and 62%
identity with S. cerevisiae Prp8. A central 290-amino acid stretch shows
the highest identity, and the least conserved regions are located at the
N and C termini. Northern blot analysis revealed highest expression of a
7.8-kb transcript in skeletal muscle and heart, with lower expression in
pancreas, kidney, lung, placenta, and brain, and almost undetectable
expression in liver.

GENE FUNCTION

By sedimentation analysis, radioimmunoprecipitations, and Far Western
(overlay) analysis, Achsel et al. (1998) determined that the 220-kD
PRPF8 protein has a central structural role in the architecture of the
U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) particle. The 220-kD protein
is directly bound by the 40-kD component (SPF38; 607797) and by the
116-kD component (603892).

Luo et al. (1999) determined that antibodies to PRPF8 immunoprecipitated
the major U2 (180690)-dependent spliceosome. The precipitate included
pre-mRNA in addition to splicing intermediates and products, suggesting
that PRPF8 joined the spliceosome prior to the first chemical step and
remained associated with the complex through both splicing reactions.
Antibodies also immunoprecipitated the minor U12-dependent spliceosome,
with coimmunoprecipitation of pre-mRNA, lariat intermediate, lariat
product, and ligated exons.

GENE STRUCTURE

Luo et al. (1999) determined that the PRPF8 gene contains 43 exons. The
first exon is untranslated.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Luo et al. (1999) mapped the PRPF8 gene to
chromosome 17p13.3. By Southern blot analysis, they determined that
PRPF8 is represented by a single gene.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Mozaffari-Jovin et al. (2013) showed by crystal structure and
biochemical analyses that the Prp8 protein, a major regulator of the
spliceosome, can insert its C-terminal tail into the RNA-binding tunnel
of Brr2 (601664), thereby intermittently blocking Brr2's RNA-binding,
adenosine triphosphatase, and U4/U6-unwinding activities. Inefficient
Brr2 repression is the only recognizable phenotype associated with
certain retinitis pigmentosa-linked Prp8 mutations that map to its
C-terminal tail. Mozaffari-Jovin et al. (2013) concluded that their data
showed how a Ski2-like RNA helicase can be reversibly inhibited by a
protein cofactor that directly competes with RNA substrate binding.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By linkage mapping, the RP13 locus (600059) for autosomal dominant
retinitis pigmentosa (adRP) was mapped to chromosome 17p13.3 in a large
South African adRP family of British descent (Greenberg et al., 1994).
Using a positional cloning and candidate gene strategy, McKie et al.
(2001) identified 7 different missense mutations in the PRPF8 splicing
factor gene in adRP families (see, e.g., 607300.0001-607300.0005). Three
of the mutations cosegregated within 3 RP13-linked families including
the original large South African pedigree, and 4 additional mutations
had been identified in other unrelated adRP families. The 7 mutations
are clustered within a 14-codon stretch within the last exon of this
large 7-kb transcript. The altered amino acid residues at the C terminus
exhibited a high degree of conservation across species as diverse as
humans, Arabidopsis, and trypanosome, suggesting that some functional
significance may be associated with this part of the protein.

Towns et al. (2010) identified 3 mutations in PRPF8, including the first
documented mutation outside exon 42 (607300.0006) and the first de novo
mutation (607300.0002). They compared clinical data for 75 RP13
patients, which revealed that whereas the effect on peripheral retinal
function is severe, patients generally retain good visual acuity in at
least one eye until the fifth or sixth decade. They noted that the
H2309P (607300.0002) and H2309R (607300.0001) mutations seemed to be
associated with a worse prognosis than the R2310K mutation
(607300.0003), an observation that correlated with results of studies in
yeast.

Maubaret et al. (2011) presented detailed genotype/phenotype correlation
in 2 British RP13 families, including the one with an exon 38 mutation
reported by Towns et al. (2010).

By quantitating RNA content in Northern blots, Tanackovic et al. (2011)
determined that normal human retina expressed about 7 times more major
snRNAs than other tissues tested. Retina also expressed about twice as
many minor snRNAs than other tissues, except for testis, which had
comparable minor snRNA content. Retina also showed higher content of
processed pre-mRNAs. Compared with normal human lymphocytes, patient
lymphocyte cell lines with mutations in the PRPF31 (606419), PRPF3
(607301), and PRPF8 genes showed mutation- and gene-specific changes in
the stoichiometry of snRNAs and altered composition of the precatalytic
U4/U6.U5 complex. Mutations in the PRPF genes caused delayed spliceosome
assembly, with transcript-specific splicing defects and altered patterns
of alternative splicing. Tanackovic et al. (2011) concluded that
retinitis pigmentosa is a systemic splicing disease, but that retina is
more sensitive to the defect due to elevated splicing activity in retina
compared with other tissues.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 13
PRPF8, HIS2309ARG

In a large South African family with retinitis pigmentosa-13 (600059),
McKie et al. (2001) found affected individuals heterozygous for an
A-to-G transition at position 6967 in exon 42 of the PRPF8 gene, which
resulted in a his2309-to-arg (H2309R) substitution. Histidine-2309 is
one of several highly conserved residues in this region of the protein.

.0002
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 13
PRPF8, HIS2309PRO

In a large British family with retinitis pigmentosa-13 (600059), McKie
et al. (2001) found affected individuals heterozygous for an A-to-C
transversion at position 6967 in exon 42 of the PRPF8 gene, which
resulted in a his2309-to-pro (H2309P) substitution. Histidine-2309 is
one of several highly conserved residues in this region of the protein.

Towns et al. (2010) detected this mutation de novo in a 9-year-old
Caucasian boy. They commented that this observation could imply that
this codon, and potentially this region of the gene, may represent a
mutational hotspot. This was said to be the first report of a de novo
mutation in PRPF8 resulting in retinitis pigmentosa.

RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 13
PRPF8, ARG2310LYS

In a Dutch family with retinitis pigmentosa-13 (600059), McKie et al.
(2001) found affected individuals heterozygous for a G-to-A transition
at position 6970 in exon 42 of the PRPF8 gene, which resulted in an
arg2310-to-lys (R2310K) substitution. Arginine-2310 is one of several
highly conserved residues in this region of the protein.

.0004
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 13
PRPF8, PRO2301THR

In 2 British families with retinitis pigmentosa-13 (600059), McKie et
al. (2001) found affected individuals heterozygous for a C-to-A
transversion in exon 42 of the PRPF8 gene, which resulted in a
pro2301-to-thr (P2301T) substitution. Proline-2301 is one of several
highly conserved residues in this region of the protein.

.0005
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 13
PRPF8, PHE2304LEU

In 2 British families with retinitis pigmentosa-13 (600059), McKie et
al. (2001) found affected individuals heterozygous for a C-to-G
transversion at position 6953 in exon 42 of the PRPF8 gene, which
resulted in a phe2304-to-leu (F2304L) substitution. Phenylalanine-2304
is one of several highly conserved residues in this region of the
protein.

.0006
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 13
PRPF8, SER2118PHE

Towns et al. (2010) detected a 6353C-T transition in exon 38 of the
PRPF8 gene, resulting in a ser2118-to-phe substitution (S2118F), in the
proband of a British family with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa
(RP13; 600059). This was said to be the first report of a PRPF8 mutation
occurring outside exon 42.

Maubaret et al. (2011) presented a detailed genotype/phenotype
correlation of this 6-generation family, which demonstrated marked
variation in the clinical phenotype.

.0007
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 13
PRPF8, ARG2310SER

In the proband of a 3-generation British family with autosomal dominant
retinitis pigmentosa (RP13; 600059), Maubaret et al. (2011) reported a
6930G-C transversion in exon 42 of the PRPF8 gene, resulting in an
arg2310-to-ser substitution (R2310S).

;;PAIRED BASIC AMINO ACID CLEAVING ENZYME 4; PACE4;;
SPC4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using PCR methods, Kiefer et al. (1991) identified a human
subtilisin-like protease gene, which they designated PACE4. PCR primers
were designed to be specific for the subfamily of eukaryotic
subtilisin-like proteases with specificity for paired basic amino acid
residue processing motifs. The PACE4 gene also encoded a smaller
subtilisin-related polypeptide derived by alternative mRNA splicing. As
with the product of the PACE gene (FURIN; 136950), the tissue
distribution of PACE4 was widespread, with comparatively higher levels
in the liver.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization using isolated cosmid clones, Kiefer et al.
(1991) mapped the PACE4 gene to chromosome 15 in close proximity to the
PACE gene at 15q25-q26. Double labeling in situ hybridization suggested
that the 2 genes are within 5 megabases of each other.

Mbikay et al. (1995) mapped the mouse Pace4 gene (Pcsk6) to chromosome 7
by RFLP analysis of a DNA panel from an interspecific backcross. It was
located at a distance of 13 cM from the Pcsk3 locus, which specifies
furin (136950), another member of the proprotein convertase
subtilisin-like family of enzymes previously mapped to mouse chromosome
7. This is in concordance with the known close proximity of these 2 loci
in the homologous region on human 15q25-qter. Pcsk3 and Pcsk6 map to a
region of mouse chromosome 7 that has been associated cytogenetically
with postnatal lethality in maternal disomy, suggesting that these genes
may be imprinted.

Transport of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to the cell surface
membrane is critical for receptor-ligand recognition. However, mammalian
GPCR odorant receptors (ORs), when heterologously expressed in cells,
are poorly expressed on the cell surface. By screening for genes that
induced cell surface expression of ORs expressed in human embryonic
kidney cells, Saito et al. (2004) identified mouse and human REEP1. The
deduced mouse Reep1 protein contains 201 amino acids. Reep1 has 2
transmembrane domains, the first of which may function as a signal
peptide. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues detected expression of
Reep1 in olfactory and vomeronasal organs and in brain. In situ
hybridization of mouse olfactory epithelium revealed specific expression
of Reep1 in olfactory neurons. In situ hybridization of mouse brain
detected Reep1 expression in a subset of brain cells.

Beetz et al. (2012) found expression of the Reep1 gene in large motor
neurons of the ventral horn of the murine spinal cord. In HeLa cells,
wildtype human REEP1 localized to a cytoplasmic network consistent with
the tubular portion of the peripheral endoplasmic reticulum (ER).

GENE FUNCTION

Saito et al. (2004) showed that mouse Reep1 promoted functional cell
surface expression of ORs expressed in human embryonic kidney cells.
Reep1 was associated with OR proteins and enhanced the OR responses to
odorants, but its effects were much weaker than those shown by Rtp1
(609137) and Rtp2 (609138).

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the REEP1
gene to chromosome 2 (TMAP D2S1982).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Zuchner et al. (2006) identified mutations in the REEP1 gene causing
hereditary spastic paraplegia (SPG31; 610250) in 6.5% of patients in
their sample, making REEP1 the third most common HSP gene after spastin
(SPAST; 604277) and atlastin (ATL1; 606439). Since REEP1 is widely
expressed and localized to mitochondria, the findings underscored the
importance of mitochondrial function in neurodegenerative disease.

Beetz et al. (2008) identified 16 different mutations, including 14
novel mutations, in the REEP1 gene (see, e.g., 609139.0003-609139.0004)
in 16 (3.0%) of 535 unrelated patients with familial or sporadic SPG.
Small frameshift mutations were the most common type of REEP1 mutation.
Most patients with confirmed SPG31 had a pure phenotype, although some
also reported impaired distal vibration sense, urge incontinence, or
distal amyotrophy. There was a bimodal distribution of age onset: most
(71%) patients had onset in the first or second decade, whereas the rest
had onset after age 30 years. Mutations were distributed throughout the
gene, except for exon 3, and there were no apparent genotype/phenotype
correlations. Beetz et al. (2008) postulated haploinsufficiency as the
main molecular genetic mechanism.

In affected members of an Austrian family with autosomal dominant distal
hereditary motor neuronopathy type VB (HMN5B; 614751), Beetz et al.
(2012) identified a heterozygous splice site mutation in the REEP1 gene
(609139.0006), resulting in skipping of exon 5 and a mutant protein
lacking residues 102-139. The mutation was found by linkage analysis
followed by exome sequencing. The patients had a purely lower motor
neuron phenotype, with weakness and atrophy of the intrinsic hand
muscles and milder peroneal weakness and atrophy. There were no signs of
spasticity. A mutant REEP1 protein lacking exon 5 showed some
localization similar to wildtype, but also accumulated in cytoplasmic
compact structures of varying sizes, with the largest in the perinuclear
regions. REEP1 lacking exon 5 showed colocalization with atlastin-1
(606439), including in the abnormal cytoplasmic structures. In contrast,
the A20E mutant protein (609139.0004) associated with SPG31 showed
severely altered localization to numerous punctate small structures
throughout the cytoplasm and no localization to the ER. Moreover, A20E
did not colocalize with atlastin. These findings suggested a different
pathomechanism of these 2 mutations, which may explain the different
associated phenotypes. Beetz et al. (2012) postulated that
loss-of-function REEP1 mutations (i.e., A20E) may cause upper motor
neuron disease, whereas possible gain-of-function mutations (102_139del)
may cause lower motor neuron disease. The findings expanded the
phenotypic spectrum associated with REEP1 mutations, similar to that
observed with BSCL2 (606158).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 31, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
REEP1, 1-BP DEL, 507C

In a family with hereditary spastic paraplegia showing linkage to 2p12
(SPG31; 610250), Zuchner et al. (2006) identified a single-basepair
deletion, 507delC, in the REEP1 gene.

.0002
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 31, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
REEP1, IVS3AS, A-G, -2

In a family with hereditary spastic paraplegia showing linkage to 2p12
(SPG31; 610250), Zuchner et al. (2006) identified a splice site
mutation, 182-2A-G, in the REEP1 gene.

.0003
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 31, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
REEP1, 606+43G-T, 3-PRIME UTR

In patients with SPG31 (610250), Zuchner et al. (2006) identified a
heterozygous G-to-T transversion in a highly conserved domain of the
3-prime untranslated region (606+43G-T) of the REEP1 gene. The mutation
occurred in a microRNA-binding site (MIRN140; 611894), and was predicted
to foster suppressive miRNA-mediated effects on translation, leading to
less available REEP1 protein.

Beetz et al. (2008) identified the 606+43G-T mutation in 2 unrelated
probands with SPG31.

Hewamadduma et al. (2009) identified a heterozygous 606+43G-T mutation
in affected members of 2 unrelated British families with SPG31. The
proband of the first family developed unsteady gait and increased tone
and hyperreflexia in the upper and lower limbs at age 25 years. The
disease progressed, and she became wheelchair-bound. She also had mild
distal sensory loss. The proband of the second family had difficulties
in running and walking since age 9. At age 27, she had severe spastic
tetraparesis with spastic dysarthria and dysphagia, indicating bulbar
involvement. The findings indicated an expanded phenotypic spectrum
associated with REEP1 mutations.

.0004
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 31, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
REEP1, ALA20GLU

In 2 unrelated probands with SPG31 (610250), Beetz et al. (2008)
identified a heterozygous 59C-A transversion in exon 2 of the REEP1
gene, resulting in an ala20-to-glu (A20E) substitution in the first
transmembrane domain. One of the patients had a family history of the
disorder.

In HeLa cells, Beetz et al. (2012) found that the A20E mutant protein
showed severely altered localization to numerous punctate small
structures throughout the cytoplasm and no localization to the ER, as
was found with wildtype REEP1. The mutant A20E REEP1 protein showed no
interaction with atlastin-1 (606439).

.0005
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 31, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
REEP1, ARG113TER

In 3 affected members of a British family with SPG31 (610250),
Hewamadduma et al. (2009) identified a heterozygous 337C-T transition in
exon 5 of the REEP1 gene, resulting in an arg113-to-ter (R113X)
substitution. The mutation was not identified in 132 British control
individuals. The age at onset ranged between 15 and 30 years. The
proband had increased tone and hyperreflexia of all 4 limbs. Both he and
his affected father also had profound lower limb wasting. All 3 had pes
cavus and severe gait disturbances, necessitating wheelchair use by the
early thirties. Neurophysiologic studies of the proband showed chronic
denervation in the peroneal and quadriceps muscles, consistent with a
motor neuropathy. The amyotrophy and neuropathy in this family were
reminiscent of distal motor neuronopathy type VB (614751) (Beetz et al.,
2012). Beetz et al. (2012) suggested that the R113X mutation may
partially escape nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and thus also have a toxic
gain-of-function effect causing lower motor neuron disease.

.0006
NEURONOPATHY, DISTAL HEREDITARY MOTOR, TYPE VB
REEP1, IVS4AS, A-G, -2

In affected members of an Austrian family with autosomal dominant distal
hereditary motor neuronopathy type VB (HMN5B; 614751), Beetz et al.
(2012) identified a heterozygous A-to-G transition in intron 4 of the
REEP1 gene (305-2A-G), resulting in the skipping of exon 5. The mutant
transcript was translated into a protein with internal deletion of a
highly conserved portion of the protein (102_139del). The variant was
not detected in over 10,000 available control chromosomes or in 88 local
control individuals. The patients had a purely lower motor neuron
phenotype, with weakness and atrophy of the intrinsic hand muscles and
milder peroneal weakness and atrophy. There were no signs of spasticity.
In HeLa cells, human wildtype REEP1 localized to a cytoplasmic network
consistent with the tubular portion of the peripheral endoplasmic
reticulum. Mutant REEP1 lacking exon 5 showed some localization similar
to wildtype, but also accumulated in cytoplasmic compact structures of
varying sizes, with the largest in the perinuclear regions. REEP1
lacking exon 5 showed colocalization with atlastin-1 (606439), including
in the abnormal cytoplasmic structures. The A20E mutant protein
(609139.0004) showed severely altered localization to numerous punctate
small structures throughout the cytoplasm and no localization to the ER.
Moreover, A20E did not colocalize with atlastin. These findings
suggested a different pathomechanism of these 2 mutations, which may
explain the different associated phenotypes. Beetz et al. (2012)
postulated that loss-of-function REEP1 mutations (i.e., A20E) may cause
upper motor neuron disease, whereas possible gain-of-function mutations
(102_139del) may cause lower motor neuron disease.

;;PTPN20, CENTROMERIC COPY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Protein tyrosine phosphorylation plays an integral role in cellular
signaling and controls diverse cellular responses. Tyrosine
phosphorylation is a reversible and dynamic process controlled by the
activities of protein tyrosine kinases, which mediate the
phosphorylation reaction, and protein tyrosine phosphatases, such as
PTPN20A, which catalyze tyrosine dephosphorylation (Fodero-Tavoletti et
al., 2005).

CLONING

Using differential display to identify genes upregulated during
differentiation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, followed by
5-prime RACE of human testis and umbilical vein endothelial cell mRNA,
Fodero Tavoletti et al. (2005) cloned multiple PTPN20A splice variants.
The most widely expressed variant encodes a deduced 411-amino acid
protein with a 280-amino acid PTP catalytic domain containing 10
conserved catalytic motifs. Northern blot analysis detected high
expression of a 3.0-kb PTPN20A transcript in testis. RT-PCR detected the
primary PTPN20A transcript in all human cell lines examined, whereas the
other variants showed more restricted and variable expression. Western
blot analysis detected PTPN20A at an apparent molecular mass of 47.4 kD.
In nonsynchronized transfected COS-1 cells, epitope-tagged PTPN20A
showed an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi localization in some
cells, and diffuse cytoplasmic and cell peripheral staining in others.

GENE FUNCTION

By in vitro analysis, Fodero-Tavoletti et al. (2005) found that
recombinant PTPN20A exhibited catalytic activity toward
tyrosyl-phosphorylated substrates. In serum-starved COS-1 cells, PTPN20A
was targeted to the nucleus and the microtubule network, colocalizing
with the microtubule-organizing center and intracellular membrane
compartments, including the ER and Golgi apparatus. Stimulation of cells
with EGF (131530), osmotic shock, a PTP inhibitor, or integrin ligation
targeted PTPN20A to actin-rich structures that included membrane
ruffles.

GENE STRUCTURE

Fodero-Tavoletti et al. (2005) determined that the PTPN20A gene contains
12 exons and spans 92 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis and FISH, Fodero-Tavoletti et al. (2005)
mapped the PTPN20A gene to chromosome 10q11.2. A nearly identical copy
of PTPN20A, PTPN20B (610631), is located telomeric to PTPN20A (Hartz,
2006).

;;PLAKOPHILIN-RELATED ARMADILLO REPEAT PROTEIN-INTERACTING PDZ PROTEIN;

ACTIVATED IN PROSTATE CANCER; AIPC;;
KIAA0300
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1997) cloned PDZD2, which they designated
KIAA0300. Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis with NPRAP/delta-catenin
(CTNND2; 604275) as bait, followed by PCR of rat brain cDNA, Deguchi et
al. (2000) cloned rat PDZD2, which they called PAPIN.

Using differential display analysis, Chaib et al. (2001) identified a
transcript that was substantially upregulated in prostate primary
tumor-derived cell lines compared with a normal tissue-derived cell
line. By database analysis, they determined that the gene, which they
designated AIPC, was identical to KIAA0300 and the homolog of rat PAPIN.
Human PDZD2 contains 2,642 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass
of 280 kD. It contains 6 PDZ domains, each containing 80 to 90 residues
and a signature GLGF/L sequence. Yeung et al. (2003) found that PDZD2
shares 39% sequence identity with the pro-IL16 protein (IL16; 603035)
over a C-terminal 215-amino acid region, including a conserved
tryptophan residue important for binding of a secreted IL16 PDZ domain
produced by posttranslational processing. Using Western blot analysis
and mass spectrometry, Yeung et al. (2003) showed that PDZD2, like
pro-IL16, undergoes caspase-dependent posttranslational cleavage at its
C terminus, generating a 37-kD secreted peptide, sPDZD2, that contains 2
PDZ domains. Expression of sPDZD2 was detected in most mouse tissues
tested.

Using immunohistochemistry, Deguchi et al. (2000) colocalized rat PDZD2
and PKP4 (604276) to cell-cell contacts in kidney cells and bronchial
epithelial cells, whereas Yeung et al. (2003) localized rat PDZD2
primarily to the endoplasmic reticulum with a small proportion showing
nuclear localization. Chaib et al. (2001) found that PDZD2 staining was
mainly cytoplasmic in human prostate sections.

GENE FUNCTION

By coimmunoprecipitation of rat PDZD2 and PKP4 expressed in COS-7 cells,
Deguchi et al. (2000) showed that PDZD2 interacts with the PKP4 PDZ
domain.

By Western blot analysis and immunohistochemical and double
immunofluorescence studies, Ma et al. (2006) localized rat PDZD2 and
sPDZD2 specifically to pancreatic beta cells, with no expression
detected in alpha cells. Recombinant sPDZD2 induced cell proliferation
in rat insulinoma cell line INS-1E in a concentration-dependent manner,
with the highest mitogenic effect detected under low serum (0.5%)
conditions. At higher concentrations, sPDZD2 inhibited transcription
from the rat insulin I promoter (INS; 176730) while its effect on cell
proliferation was reduced.

Chaib et al. (2001) performed immunohistochemical analysis of a tissue
microarray comprising 158 tumor, 18 high-grade prostatic intraepithelial
neoplasia, and 91 normal prostate specimens with an anti-PDZD2 antibody.
Abundant PDZD2 expression was demonstrated in 75% of tumors, 83% of
prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia lesions, and 3% of normal tissues (p
less than 0.0001). Chaib et al. (2001) suggested that accumulation of
the PDZD2 protein may be associated with the initiation or early
promotion of prostate tumorigenesis.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1997) mapped the PDZD2 gene
to chromosome 5. Ma et al. (2006) stated that the PDZD2 gene maps to
5p13.2.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Basigin is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, with a structure
related to the putative primordial form of the family. As members of the
immunoglobulin superfamily play fundamental roles in intercellular
recognition involved in various immunologic phenomena, differentiation,
and development, basigin is thought also to play a role in intercellular
recognition (Miyauchi et al., 1991; Kanekura et al., 1991).

CLONING

Basigin was cloned as a carrier of an oncodevelopmental carbohydrate
marker expressed in teratocarcinoma stem cells. It is expressed broadly
in both embryos and adults. (Miyauchi et al., 1990, 1991; Kanekura et
al., 1991).

By biochemical, immunochemical, and micropeptide sequencing analyses,
Spring et al. (1997) determined that the OK blood group antigen (see
111380) is identical to the M6 leukocyte activation antigen and BSG.
Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated ubiquitous expression in
leukocytes. Immunohistochemistry indicated that OK antigen is expressed
in a number of normal human tissues as well as in malignant cells.
Immunoblot analysis showed expression of a 34-kD protein and a 50- to
70-kD protein of similar size to that seen in erythrocyte membranes.

By PCR using primers designed from purified peptide fragments, followed
by RACE, Biswas et al. (1995) cloned EMMPRIN. The deduced 269-amino acid
protein encodes a 21-amino acid N-terminal signal peptide, followed by a
185-amino acid extracellular domain, a putative transmembrane region,
and a short C-terminal domain. The extracellular domain contains 2
immunoglobulin-like subdomains, and the putative transmembrane region
has features of a leucine zipper motif. Northern blot analysis detected
a 1.7-kb EMMPRIN transcript in a human hepatic stellate cell line.

Wu et al. (2011) stated that there are 4 splice variants of BSG. RT-PCR
showed that only variant-2 was expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear
cells. Variant-2 lacks exon 3 and encodes a protein with a deletion in
its N-terminal region compared with the full-length protein.

GENE STRUCTURE

Guo et al. (1998) determined that the BSG gene contains 8 exons and
spans 10.8 kb. Exon 1 contains the 5-prime UTR and the translation start
site, which falls within a CpG island. The 5-prime flanking sequence
contains 3 consensus binding sites for SP1 (189906) and 2 sites for AP2
(107580), but no TATA or CAAT boxes.

Wu et al. (2011) reported that the BSG gene contains 10 exons. The first
4 exons, including 2 alternative first exons, are subject to alternative
splicing.

MAPPING

Kaname et al. (1993) mapped the human BSG gene to 19p13.3 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. Using an interspecific backcross
panel and microsatellite polymorphisms as markers, Simon-Chazottes et
al. (1992) mapped the gene for basigin (Bsg) to mouse chromosome 10.

GENE FUNCTION

Pushkarsky et al. (2001) identified CD147 as a receptor for
extracellular cyclophilin A (CYPA; 123840). They found that CD147
enhanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection through
interaction with CYPA incorporated into virions. Virus-associated CYPA
coimmunoprecipitated with CD147 from infected cells, and antibody to
CD147 inhibited HIV-1 entry. Viruses whose replication did not require
CYPA were resistant to the inhibitory effect of anti-CD147 antibody.
Pushkarsky et al. (2001) concluded that HIV-1 entry depends on an
interaction between virus-associated CYPA and CD147 on a target cell.

Yurchenko et al. (2001) determined that CD147 also serves as a receptor
for cyclophilin B (CYPB; 123841). CYPB induced Ca(2+) flux, ERK (see
MAPK3; 601795) phosphorylation, and chemotaxis in CD147-transfected
Chinese hamster ovary cells, but not in control cells. The chemotactic
response of primary human neutrophils to CYPB was blocked by antibodies
to CD147.

Using expression cloning, Renno et al. (2002) identified CD147 as a
molecule expressed on the surface of cycling thymocytes. CD147
expression correlated with immature thymocyte cycling, and ligation of
the molecule on these cells inhibited their development into mature T
cells.

Zhou et al. (2005) identified CD147 as a subunit of native
gamma-secretase complexes (see PSEN1; 104311) purified from HeLa cell
membranes. Coimmunoprecipitation studies confirmed the presence of CD147
in HeLa cell complexes and in soluble complexes from a human neural cell
line and embryonic kidney cells. Depletion of CD147 by RNA interference
increased production of amyloid-beta (see APP; 104760) peptides without
changing the expression of other gamma-secretase components or APP
substrates. Zhou et al. (2005) concluded that the presence of CD147
within the gamma-secretase complex downmodulates production of
amyloid-beta peptides.

Schreiner et al. (2007) found that SHREW1 (AJAP1; 610972), a protein
associated with cellular invasion, interacted with CD147 in epithelial
cells. Downregulation of SHREW1 or CD147 using small interfering RNA in
HeLa cells decreased invasiveness without affecting proliferation.
Schreiner et al. (2007) concluded that SHREW1-CD147 interaction is
associated with regulation of cellular invasion.

By systematic screening of a library of erythrocyte proteins, Crosnier
et al. (2011) identified basigin as a receptor for PfRh5, a Plasmodium
falciparum ligand essential for blood stage growth of the parasite, the
causative agent of malaria (see 611162). Soluble basigin or basigin
knockdown inhibited erythrocyte invasion by all P. falciparum strains,
and complete blocking was achieved by anti-basigin antibodies. OK(a-)
red blood cells, which express the glu92-to-lys (E92K; 109480.0001)
variant of basigin, had reduced binding to PfRh5 due to slower
association and faster dissociation rates. Another basigin variant,
leu90 to pro (L90P), did not interact with PfRh5 at all. Crosnier et al.
(2011) concluded that the dependence on a single receptor-ligand pair
across many P. falciparum strains may provide novel possibilities for
therapeutic intervention.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Wu et al. (2011) noted that a psoriasis susceptibility locus, PSORS6
(605364), is located on chromosome 19p13, where the BSG gene maps. They
genotyped a T-to-A SNP, dbSNP rs8259, in the 3-prime UTR of the BSG gene
in 668 psoriasis patients and 1,143 healthy controls from a central
south Chinese population. The T allele was associated with significantly
decreased susceptibility to psoriasis (odds ratio = 0.758; p = 0.002).
Wu et al. (2011) found that the T allele of dbSNP rs8259 created a
functional binding site for microRNA-492 (MIR492; 614384), leading to
reduced translation of the BSG transcript. In contrast, the A allele
abolished the MIR492-binding site and was associated with increased
expression of BSG variant-2 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

ANIMAL MODEL

Naruhashi et al. (1997) generated mice deficient in basigin by targeted
disruption. Bsg -/- mice showed worse performance than their wildtype
and heterozygous littermates in the Y-maze task, which assesses
short-term memory, and in the water-finding task, which examines latent
learning, without any motor dysfunction. Moreover, the mutant mice
showed less acclimation in the habituation task compared with the
wildtype mice. The mutant mice were also more sensitive to electric foot
shock. Naruhashi et al. (1997) found these findings consistent with the
expression profile of basigin in the central nervous system and
suggested that basigin may play an important role in learning and memory
as well as in sensory functions.

Kuno et al. (1998) demonstrated that female mice deficient in basigin
are infertile due to failure of female reproductive processes including
not only implantation but also fertilization. Bsg mRNA expression in
cumulus cells and basolateral localization of the Bsg protein in the
endometrial epithelium further support the importance of Bsg in these
processes.

In Bsg -/- mice, Philp et al. (2003) found severe reduction in
accumulation of MCT1 (600682) and MCT3 (610409) proteins in the retinal
pigment epithelium and concomitant reduction in the MCT1 and MCT4
(603877) proteins in the neural retina, supporting a role for basigin in
the targeting of these transporters to the plasma membrane. The authors
concluded that decreased expression of MCT1 and MCT4 on the surfaces of
Muller and photoreceptor cells might compromise energy metabolism in the
outer retina, leading to abnormal photoreceptor cell function and
degeneration.

In order to determine the contribution of genetic background on the
Bsg-null phenotype, Chen et al. (2004) developed 3 strains of Bsg-null
mice. In 2 strains, lack of Bsg caused a high rate of embryonic
lethality, sterility in both sexes, and blindness associated with
abnormal electroretinograms and retinal degeneration predominantly in
the photoreceptor layer. The third strain showed higher embryonic
survival, but infertility and blindness persisted.

Spring et al. (1997) determined that a G-to-A transition at nucleotide
331 of the BSG gene, leading to a glu92-to-lys substitution, resulted in
the OK(a-) phenotype (111380) in 2 Japanese sisters and an unrelated
Japanese donor. The authors noted that the OK(a-) phenotype had only
been identified in 8 families, all of which were Japanese.

601890	TITLE *601890 PROTEIN-TYROSINE KINASE PTK7; PTK7
;;COLON CARCINOMA KINASE-4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) play important roles in regulating cell
proliferation and differentiation during development. Lee et al. (1993)
isolated a 220-bp fragment of PTK7 cDNA through a screen designed to
identify tyrosine kinase mRNAs expressed in normal human melanocytes.
Park et al. (1996) isolated a full-length PTK7 cDNA and found that it
encodes a receptor protein-tyrosine kinase-like molecule closely related
to a chick kinase-like gene whose function was unknown. Mossie et al.
(1995) independently isolated the PTK7 gene from colon carcinoma and
designated it colon carcinoma kinase-4.

MAPPING

Lee et al. (1993) mapped a fragment of PTK7 to chromosome 6 by Southern
blot analysis using a panel of human-hamster somatic cell hybrids. Banga
et al. (1997) sublocalized the PTK7 gene to 6p21.1-p12.2 by fluorescence
in situ hybridization.

ANIMAL MODEL

Lu et al. (2004) demonstrated that a mutation in the mouse Ptk7 gene,
which encodes an evolutionarily conserved transmembrane protein with
tyrosine kinase homology, disrupts neural tube closure and stereociliary
bundle orientation, and shows genetic interactions with a mutation in
the mouse Van Gogh homolog Vangl2 (600533). Lu et al. (2004) also showed
that PTK7 is dynamically localized during hair cell polarization, and
that the Xenopus homolog of PTK7 is required for neural convergent
extension and neural tube closure. Lu et al. (2004) concluded that their
results identified PTK7 as a novel regulator of planar cell polarity in
vertebrates.

615003	TITLE *615003 DDHD DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; DDHD2
;;KIAA0725
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The DDHD2 gene encodes a phospholipase that hydrolyzes sn-1 ester bonds
of phospholipids, producing 2-acyl-lysophospholipids and fatty acids.
DDHD2 prefers phosphatidic acid as substrate and has a role in efficient
membrane trafficking from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane
(summary by Sato et al., 2010).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) obtained a partial DDHD2 clone, which they
designated KIAA0725. RT-PCR ELISA detected variable DDHD2 expression in
all human tissues examined, with highest expression in brain, followed
by heart, lung, ovary, and testis, much lower expression in kidney,
liver, skeletal muscle, and pancreas, and little to none in spleen.

Using 5-prime RACE of a placenta cDNA library to extend KIAA0725,
Nakajima et al. (2002) obtained a full-length KIAA0725 clone. The
deduced 711-amino acid has a central consensus lipase signature motif,
Gly-X-Ser-X-Gly, and a calculated molecular mass of 81 kD. Northern blot
analysis detected a major transcript of 5.4 kb and a minor transcript of
2.8 kb in all human tissues examined, with highest expression in heart,
brain, skeletal muscle, and testis. Epitope-tagged KIAA0725 was
expressed in punctate structures and large aggregates that partly
overlapped with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi markers.

Using immunofluorescence microscopy and photobleaching experiments, Sato
et al. (2010) showed that HeLa cell KIAA0725 rapidly cycled between the
perinuclear cis-Golgi and cytosol.

Inoue et al. (2012) described the domain structure of the full-length
711-amino acid KIAA0725. It has an N-terminal WWE domain predicted to
mediate protein-protein interaction, followed by a PI-PLC-X domain, a
lipase motif, a SAM domain, and a C-terminal DDHD domain. KIAA0725
localized to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and ER exit
sites.

Schuurs-Hoeijmakers et al. (2012) found high expression of the DDHD2
gene in multiple human brain regions, including the cerebellum, cortex,
hippocampus, and thalamus. Expression in the brain was about 10-fold
higher than in other human tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Nakajima et al. (2002) showed that soluble cytosolic KIAA0725 expressed
in mammalian cells cleaved the ester linkage at the sn-1 position of
phosphatidic acid in the presence or absence of Triton X-100. It also
hydrolyzed phosphatidylethanolamine, but only in the absence of Triton
X-100. KIAA0725 showed no activity against other phospholipids tested.
Overexpression of KIAA0725 altered the distribution of ER-Golgi
proteins. Mutation analysis revealed that catalytic ser351 was required
for lipase activity and for some, but not all, effects of KIAA0725
expression on ER-Golgi protein disorganization.

Using small interfering RNAs, Sato et al. (2010) showed that knockdown
of KIAA0725 in HeLa cells retarded the transport of vesicular stomatitis
virus-encoded glycoprotein (VSVG) from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma
membrane.

Using a lipid overlay and liposome sedimentation assays, Inoue et al.
(2012) showed that recombinant human KIAA0725 bound phosphatidylinositol
3-phosphate, i.e., PI(3)P, PI(4)P, and PI(5)P. Mutation analysis
revealed that the arg434-lys435-lys436 motif within its SAM domain, but
not its catalytic ser351, was required for binding of KIAA0725 to
phospholipids, and for KIAA0725 Golgi/ERGIC membrane association.
KIAA0725 formed oligomers via several interaction sites, including the
DDHD domain, which was also required for phospholipid binding. Nearly
the entire molecule was required for phospholipase activity.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the DDHD2 gene
to chromosome 8.

Hartz (2012) mapped the DDHD2 gene to chromosome 8p11.23 based on an
alignment of the DDHD2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB018268) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By exome sequencing of 2 unrelated families with a complex form of
autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia (SPG54; 615033),
Schuurs-Hoeijmakers et al. (2012) identified biallelic mutations in the
DDHD2 gene (615003.0001-615003.0004). The mutations segregated with the
phenotype in both families. Affected individuals from a large Omani
family with a similar disorder, originally reported as family A by
Al-Yahyaee et al. (2006), were found to be homozygous for another
mutation (615003.0005). An unrelated Iranian patient was homozygous for
yet another DDHD2 mutation (615003.0006). Five of the 6 mutations were
predicted to introduce a premature termination codon into the mRNA. The
phenotype was characterized by delayed psychomotor development,
intellectual disability, and early-onset spasticity of the lower limbs.
Brain MRI showed a thin corpus callosum and periventricular white matter
lesions, whereas brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed an
abnormal lipid peak. Patient fibroblasts did not show any gross
abnormalities in lipid metabolism or organelle morphology. Knockdown of
the Drosophila Ddhd ortholog in 2 cell lines did not change the overall
synaptic terminals in the neuromuscular junction, although 1 cell line
showed smaller synaptic terminals. Knockdown in all 3 cell lines caused
a decrease in active-zone number per synaptic terminal; the active zones
represent the presynaptic sites of neurotransmitter release. However,
mutant flies showed no obvious motor abnormalities. Overall, the
findings suggested that DDHD2 may play a role in synaptic organization
and plasticity.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 54, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
DDHD2, 1-BP INS, 1804T

In 2 sibs of Dutch Filipino descent with autosomal recessive spastic
paraplegia-54 (SPG54; 615033), Schuurs-Hoeijmakers et al. (2012)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the DDHD2 gene: a
1-bp insertion (1804insT), resulting in a frameshift and premature
termination (Thr602IlefsTer18), and a 1-bp deletion (2057delA;
615003.0002), resulting in a frameshift and premature termination
(Glu686GlyfsTer35). RT-PCR analysis suggested that 1 of the alleles,
probably 1804delT, resulted in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The
mutations were found by exome sequencing and confirmed by Sanger
sequencing. Each unaffected parent was heterozygous for 1 of the
mutations, which were not found in several large exome databases.

In 2 Canadian sibs with SPG54 (615033), Schuurs-Hoeijmakers et al.
(2012) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the DDHD2
gene: a 1-bp duplication (138dupC), resulting in a frameshift and
premature termination (Ile463HisfsTer6), and a 1978G-C transversion,
resulting in an asp660-to-his (D660H; 615003.0004) substitution at a
conserved residue in the RIDYXL motif. The mutations were found by exome
sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The 1-bp duplication was
not found in several large exome databases. The D660H mutation was found
in 1 of 13,006 control alleles, but not in a local SNP database of 2,302
alleles. Each unaffected parent was heterozygous for 1 of the mutations.

DDHD2, ARG516TER

In affected members of a large consanguineous Omani family with SPG54
(615033), Schuurs-Hoeijmakers et al. (2012) identified a homozygous
1546C-T transition in the DDHD2 gene, resulting in an arg516-to-ter
(R516X) substitution. This family had previously been reported by
Al-Yahyaee et al. (2006) as family A, showing linkage to chromosome 8p.
RT-PCR analysis suggested that the mutation resulted in
nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.

In an Iranian man, born of consanguineous parents, with SPG54 (615033),
Schuurs-Hoeijmakers et al. (2012) identified a homozygous 859C-T
transition in exon 9 of the DDHD2 gene, resulting in an arg287-to-ter
(R287X) substitution. RT-PCR analysis suggested that the mutation
resulted in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.

TFE3, a member of the helix-loop-helix family of transcription factors,
binds to the mu-E3 motif of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain enhancer and
is expressed in many cell types (Henthorn et al., 1991).

CLONING

Macchi et al. (1995) cloned the TFE3 gene. They corrected the earlier
cDNA sequence and showed that the predicted protein is 371 amino acids
long and more similar to the mouse protein of 326 amino acids than had
been previously reported.

GENE STRUCTURE

Macchi et al. (1995) showed that the TFE3 gene consists of 7 exons. The
activation domain is in exon 2, the leucine zipper in exon 6, and the
basic helix-loop-helix motif occurs from exons 4 to 6.

MAPPING

Henthorn et al. (1991) localized the TFE3 gene to the proximal short arm
of the X chromosome using a somatic cell hybrid panel. A frequent RsaI
RFLP detected by the TFE3 cDNA was found and used to confirm this
location by linkage analysis, which placed TFE3 near markers in Xp11.22.
In the course of high-resolution comparative mapping of the proximal
region of the mouse X chromosome, Blair et al. (1995) mapped the Tfe3
gene to the same region as the Gata1 gene (305371).

GENE FUNCTION

Using an expression cloning strategy, Nakagawa et al. (2006) identified
TFE3 as a transactivator of metabolic genes that are regulated through
an E box in their promoters. Adenovirus-mediated expression of TFE3 in
hepatocytes in culture and in vivo strongly activated expression of
insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS2; 600797) and AKT (164730) and
enhanced phosphorylation of insulin-signaling kinases such as AKT,
glycogen synthase kinase-3-beta (605004), and p70S6 kinase (see 608939).
TFE3 also induced hexokinase II (HK2; 601125) and insulin-induced gene-1
(INSIG1; 602055). These changes led to metabolic consequences such as
activation of glycogen and protein synthesis, but not lipogenesis, in
liver. Collectively, plasma glucose levels were markedly reduced both in
normal mice and in different mouse models of diabetes. Activation of
insulin signals in both insulin depletion and resistance suggested that
TFE3 could be a therapeutic target for diabetes.

CYTOGENETICS

Translocations involving Xp11.2 have been found in synovial sarcoma and
in a subgroup of renal adenocarcinomas, namely, papillary renal cell
carcinoma (RCCX1; 300854) (Meloni et al., 1993). Of particular interest
is the similar localization of the breakpoints within Xp11 despite the
distinct histologic origin. Sinke et al. (1993) undertook to define the
precise location of the translocations in the 2 cases, making use of
tumor-derived interspecies somatic cell hybrids in conjunction with
Southern blot analysis. The resulting mapping data made it possible to
distinguish between the 2 translocations, to review the physical map of
the proximal Xp region, and to provide a basis for the eventual
isolation of the breakpoints and the genes involved in the development
of these 2 types of solid tumors. The chromosomal break in papillary
renal cell carcinoma was found to lie between PFC (300383), OATL1
(311240), TIMP (305370), SYP (313475), and TFE3, distally; and OATL2
(258870), together with a number of DNA markers (DXS226, DXS146, DXS255,
DXS14), proximally.

Shipley et al. (1995) studied 2 RCCP cell lines carrying a
t(X;1)(p11.2;q21.2) translocation; one was derived from the first female
case to be reported. By fluorescence in situ hybridization used to
position YACs along contigs in the Xp11.2 region relative to the
breakpoint and by correlation with mapping information from the region,
they concluded that the breakpoint is situated centromeric to SYP
(131475) and telomeric to DXS255 and CLCN5 (300008).

- Fusion Genes

The specific translocation reported by Meloni et al. (1993) was between
the X chromosome and chromosome 1: t(X;1)(p11;q21). Sidhar et al. (1996)
showed that in papillary renal cell carcinoma associated with the
translocation t(X;1)(p11.2;q21.2), the TFE3 gene is fused with the PRCC
gene (179755). They noted that a frequent theme for translocations in
sarcomas is the fusion of a transcription factor activation domain to a
transcription factor DNA-binding domain.

Clark et al. (1997) identified cases of papillary renal cell carcinoma
in which the splicing factor gene SFPQ (605199) was partnered with the
TFE3 gene as a result of a translocation, t(X;1)(p11.2;p34).

Cytogenetic studies identified a recurrent der(17) due to a
nonreciprocal t(X;17)(p11.2;q25) in cases of alveolar soft part sarcoma
(ASPS) (Joyama et al., 1999). By Southern blot analysis using a TFE3
probe, Ladanyi et al. (2001) identified nongermline bands in several
ASPS cases, consistent with rearrangement and possible fusion of TFE3
with a gene on 17q25. By amplification of the 5-prime portion of cDNAs
containing the 3-prime portion of TFE3 in 2 ASPS cases, they identified
a novel sequence, ASPSCR1 (606236), fused in-frame to TFE3 exon 4 or
exon 3. RT-PCR analysis detected an ASPSCR1/TFE3 fusion transcript in
all 12 ASPS cases studied. The ASPSCR1/TFE3 fusion replaces the
N-terminal portion of TFE3 by the fused ASPSCR1 sequences, while
retaining the TFE3 DNA-binding domain, implicating transcriptional
deregulation in the pathogenesis of ASPS.

Heimann et al. (2001) identified the ASPSCR1 gene, which they called
RCC17, partnered with TFE3 in two 5-year-old Belgian girls of African
origin in whom papillary renal cell carcinomas carried the translocation
t(X;17)(p11.2;q25). In both patients, the t(X;17) fused the N terminal
region of RCC17 to the C-terminal region of TFE3 including the bHLH
DNA-binding domain and the leucine zipper dimerization domain. The
reciprocal fusion transcript TFE3/RCC17 was also expressed.

Argani et al. (2003) reported a case of renal cell carcinoma in which
the 3-prime exons of the TFE3 gene were fused with the 5-prime exons of
the CLTC gene (118955) as a result of a translocation,
t(X;17)(p11.2;q23). The patient was a 14-year-old boy who presented with
gross hematuria and was found by CT to have a finely calcified left
renal mass.

;;PM5, TELOMERIC COPY
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening a melanoma cDNA library using the metal-binding domain of
human fibroblast collagenase (MMP1; 120353) as probe, Templeton et al.
(1992) cloned NOMO1, which they designated PM5. Northern blot analysis
detected a 4.0-kb transcript in both normal and malignant colorectal
tissues.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Loftus et al. (1999) mapped the PM5 gene to a
region of chromosome 16p13.1-p11.2 that shows a high degree of gene
duplication. Scott (2004) mapped 3 copies of the PM5 gene, including
NOMO1, within this region. The NOMO1 gene maps centromeric to the BFAR
gene and telomeric to the KIAA0251 gene.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ADP-ribosylation factors, or ARFS (see ARF1; 103180), are small
GTP-binding proteins within the Ras superfamily that regulate vesicle
trafficking in eukaryotic cells. ARF1 recruits coat proteins (e.g.,
COPA; 601924) to membranes on the cytoplasmic face of the Golgi
apparatus. Cytohesins, such as CYTH3, function as guanine-nucleotide
exchange factors (GEFs) for ARFs. These proteins contain a C-terminal
pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and a central 200-amino acid region
similar to a domain within the yeast Sec7 protein, which is required for
vesicular traffic of polypeptides through the Golgi (Franco et al.,
1998).

CLONING

Klarlund et al. (1997) identified a cDNA encoding mouse Grp1 (general
receptor for phosphoinositides-1) by screening mouse adipocyte and brain
cDNA expression libraries with phosphoinositide probes. By searching an
EST database for sequences similar to mouse brain Grp1, followed by PCR
and screening of a human blood cDNA library, Venkateswarlu et al. (1998)
obtained a cDNA encoding PSCD3, which they called GRP1. The predicted
399-amino acid PSCD3 protein contains a 39-amino acid coiled-coil
domain, a 172-amino acid Sec7 domain, and a 118-amino acid PH domain.
PSCD3 shares 82.7% and 79.5% amino acid identity with PSCD1 and PSCD2
(602488), respectively, as well as 98.8% identity with mouse Grp1.

By searching an EST database for Sec7 domain-related sequences and by
screening a placenta cDNA library, Franco et al. (1998) isolated a cDNA
encoding PSCD3, which they called ARNO3. Northern blot analysis revealed
that PSCD3, in contrast to the ubiquitously expressed PSCD1 and PSCD2,
is expressed as a 4.5-kb transcript that is almost absent from liver,
thymus, and peripheral blood lymphocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

By Scatchard and mutational analyses, Venkateswarlu et al. (1998)
determined that PSCD3 binds via its PH domain to the inositol head group
of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate with high affinity. Confocal
laser microscopy demonstrated that stimulation of cells with either
epidermal growth factor (EGF; 131530) or nerve growth factor (NGF;
162030) results in PH domain-dependent translocation of PSCD3 from the
cytosol to the plasma membrane. The translocation was rapid and
transient with EGF, whereas NGF mediated a relatively longer
translocation.

Franco et al. (1998) found that PSCD3, like PSCD1 and PSCD2, showed GEF
activity, mediated by the Sec7 domain, towards ARF1 but not ARF6
(600464). Immunofluorescence microscopy indicated that overexpression of
PSCD3 induced major morphologic alterations of the Golgi apparatus,
including redistribution of Golgi resident proteins and the coat protein
COPB (600959).

By yeast 2-hybrid screening and in vitro pull-down assays, Nevrivy et
al. (2000) showed that the leucine-rich region of mouse Grasp (612027)
interacted with the N-terminal coiled-coil domain of Grp1. In
transfected HEK293 cells, Grasp enhanced Grp1 association with the
plasma membrane.

Using a library of endoribonuclease-prepared short interfering RNAs
(esiRNAs), Kittler et al. (2004) identified 37 genes required for cell
division, one of which was PSCD3. These 37 genes included several
splicing factors for which knockdown generates mitotic spindle defects.
In addition, a putative nuclear-export terminator was found to speed up
cell proliferation and mitotic progression after knockdown.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Lietzke et al. (2000) and Ferguson et al. (2000) determined the
structure of the GRP1 PH domain in the unliganded form and bound to
inositol 1,3,4,5-tetraphosphate. Lietzke et al. (2000) found that a
novel mode of phosphoinositide recognition involving a 20-residue
insertion within the beta-6/beta-7 loop explains the unusually high
specificity of the GRP1 PH domain and the promiscuous 3-phosphoinositide
binding typical of several other PH domains, including that of protein
kinase B (AKT1; 164730). By comparing the GRP1 PH domain to other PH
domains, general determinants of 3-phosphoinositide recognition and
specificity could be deduced.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PSCD3
gene to chromosome 7 (TMAP SHGC-35947).

604636	TITLE *604636 NEUREXOPHILIN 3; NXPH3
;;NPH3
DESCRIPTION Mammalian neurexophilin was discovered as a 29-kD neuronal glycoprotein
that copurifies in a tight complex with neurexin I-alpha (600565)
(Petrenko et al., 1996). By searching sequence databases using the amino
acid sequence of mammalian neurexophilin as the query, Missler and
Sudhof (1998) identified human ESTs corresponding to neurexophilins-1
(NXPH1; 604639), -2 (NXPH2; 604635), -3 (NXPH3), and -4 (NXPH4; 604637).
Comparison of the amino acid sequences of human, rat, mouse, and bovine
neurexophilins revealed that neurexophilins share a common predicted
structure composed of 5 domains: an N-terminal signal peptide, a
variable N-terminal domain, a highly conserved central domain that is
N-glycosylated, a short linker region, and a conserved C-terminal domain
that is cysteine-rich. Northern blot analysis of a variety of human
tissues detected almost brain-specific NXPH3 expression. Missler and
Sudhof (1998) concluded that neurexophilins form a family of related
glycoproteins that are proteolytically processed after synthesis. They
suggested that neurexophilins are signaling molecules that resemble
neuropeptides and that act by binding to alpha-neurexins and possibly
other receptors.

;;MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN, EPITHELIAL, 115-KD; EMAP115;;
ENSCONSIN, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF; ENS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Different types of microtubules (MTs), major components of the
cytoskeleton, contain different MT-associated proteins (MAPs), which
regulate the dynamics or stability of MTs. MAP7 is a retinoic
acid-inducible gene expressed in cells of epithelial origin and
implicated in microtubule functions required for spermatogenesis
(summary by Komada et al., 2000).

CLONING

By screening a HeLa cell expression library with antisera raised against
crude microtubule-binding proteins from HeLa cells, Masson and Kreis
(1993) isolated cDNAs encoding MAP7, which they designated EMAP115. The
predicted 749-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 84
kD, although it migrates anomalously at 115 kD by SDS-PAGE. EMAP115
contains a basic, highly charged N-terminal region that is separated
from an acidic C-terminal half by a stretch of amino acids rich in
proline and alanine (PAPA region). The N-terminal basic domain contains
the EMAP115 microtubule-binding site. Using immunoblots, the authors
determined that EMAP115 is predominantly expressed in cells of
epithelial origin. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy
indicated that it is specifically associated with microtubules in HeLa
cells. Overexpression of the N-terminal microtubule-binding domain in
monkey fibroblasts, which do not have significant levels of endogenous
EMAP115, led to stabilization of microtubules. Masson and Kreis (1993)
concluded that EMAP115 is a microtubule-stabilizing protein that may
play an important role in reorganization of microtubules during
polarization and differentiation of epithelial cells.

Vitamin A deficiency causes a number of defects, including deficient
spermatogenesis. Almost all of these defects are reversible by the
administration of a vitamin A metabolite, retinoic acid (RA), which
binds and activates 2 types of receptor families, RAR (e.g., RARA;
180240) and RXR (e.g., RXRA; 180245). Using gene trap mutagenesis on
mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, Komada et al. (2000) identified MAP7 as
an RA-responsive gene. The gene trap insertion led to a null allele of
the Map7 gene that the authors designated ROSA63. Northern blot analysis
detected broad expression of a 3.4-kb Map7 transcript, as well as a
testis-specific 2.5-kb transcript, in wildtype mice, with lower
expression in heterozygous ROSA63 mice and no expression in homozygous
ROSA63 mice, consistent with a null allele. The authors showed that RA
induces Map7 expression in ES cells in vitro and in vitamin A-deficient
mice in vivo.

GENE FUNCTION

Metzger et al. (2012) identified the microtubule-associated protein
ensconsin (ens)/MAP7 and kinesin heavy chain (KHC)/KIF5B (602809) as
essential, evolutionarily conserved regulators of myonuclear positioning
in Drosophila and cultured mammalian myotubes. Metzger et al. (2012)
found that these proteins interact physically and that expression of the
KIF5B motor domain fused to the MAP7 microtubule-binding domain rescues
nuclear positioning defects in MAP7-depleted cells. This suggested that
MAP7 links KIF5B to the microtubule cytoskeleton to promote nuclear
positioning. Finally, Metzger et al. (2012) showed that myonuclear
positioning is physiologically important. Drosophila ens mutant larvae
have decreased locomotion and incorrect myonuclear positioning, and
these phenotypes are rescued by muscle-specific expression of ens.
Metzger et al. (2012) concluded that improper nuclear positioning
contributes to muscle dysfunction in a cell-autonomous fashion.

ANIMAL MODEL

Komada et al. (2000) identified a gene trap insertion that resulted in a
null allele, designated ROSA63, of the Map7 gene. Male mice with the
ROSA63 mutation, though able to copulate, were sterile and had smaller
testes and epididymis than wildtype mice, while other organs were of
normal size. Histologic analysis showed that ROSA63 mutant mice
exhibited defective spermatogenesis, with spermatid deformation in the
first wave of spermatogenesis and subsequent germ cell loss. Both of
these abnormalities were associated with morphologically abnormal MTs in
the manchette of the spermatids and in Sertoli cells. Komada et al.
(2000) noted that similar defects occur in Rara knockout mice, but not
in other RA receptor knockout mice.

MAPPING

By interspecific backcross analysis, Komada et al. (2000) mapped the
mouse Map7 gene to the proximal region of chromosome 10 in a region
showing homology of synteny with human 6q22-q25. The authors noted that
this localization implies that MAP7 is a candidate autosomal infertility
gene.

157132	TITLE *157132 MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 4; MAP4
DESCRIPTION Chapin and Bulinski (1991) used a polyclonal antiserum raised against a
HeLa cell microtubule-associated protein of M(r) 210,000 (210-kD MAP or
MAP4), an abundant nonneuronal MAP, to isolate cDNA clones from a human
fetal brain lambda gt11 cDNA expression library. They found that this,
the major human nonneuronal MAP, resembles 2 neuronal MAPs in its
microtubule-binding domain, while most of the molecule has sequences,
and presumably functions, distinct from those of the neuronal MAPs
(e.g., 157130).

West et al. (1991) reported the structure of MAP4 on the basis of
comparisons of the human, mouse, and bovine sequences.

Chapin et al. (1995) isolated clones encoding alternatively spliced
forms of MAP4. One isoform is similar to an isoform of tau (157140) in
structure. The authors mapped human MAP4 gene to 3p21 by fluorescence in
situ hybridization. Mangan and Olmsted (1996) demonstrated that the
murine homolog is located on mouse chromosome 9.

147796	TITLE *147796 JANUS KINASE 2; JAK2
JAK2/ETV6 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

JAK2 kinase is a member of a family of tyrosine kinases involved in
cytokine receptor signaling. See 147795 for background information on
Janus kinases.

CLONING

By screening a human placenta cDNA library with a probe encoding the
catalytic domain of rat Jak2, followed by EST database searching,
Saltzman et al. (1998) obtained a cDNA encoding a full-length JAK2
sequence. The JAK2 gene encodes a 1,132-amino acid protein that shares
95% sequence similarity to rat and pig Jak2. Northern blot analysis
detected expression of 3 transcripts of 7.6, 5.9 and 4.8 kb in all
tissues tested except heart and skeletal muscle. Highest expression was
found in spleen, peripheral blood leukocytes, and testis. In heart and
skeletal muscle, significant expression of 7.6-, 4.8-, and 3.9-kb
transcripts was found.

MAPPING

Pritchard et al. (1992) mapped the JAK2 gene to chromosome 9p24 by in
situ hybridization. Gough et al. (1995) mapped the homologous gene
(Jak2) to mouse chromosome 19 in a region of homology of synteny to
human 9.

GENE FUNCTION

Campbell et al. (1994) presented evidence that JAK2 is constitutively
associated with the prolactin receptor (PRLR; 176761) and that it is
activated and tyrosine phosphorylated upon PRL binding to the PRL
receptor. These results are consistent with JAK2 serving as an early,
perhaps initial, signaling molecule for prolactin.

Watling et al. (1993) isolated a cell line, selected for its inability
to express interferon (IFN)-gamma (147570)-inducible cell-surface
markers. The cell line was deficient in all aspects of IFN-gamma
response tested but responded normally to alpha and beta IFNs (see
147660). The mutant cells could be complemented by the expression of
JAK2. Unlike IFNs alpha and beta, IFN-gamma induced rapid tyrosine
phosphorylation of JAK2 in wildtype cells, and JAK2 immunoprecipitates
from these cells showed tyrosine kinase activity. These responses were
absent in the mutant cell line. JAK2 is, therefore, required for the
response to interferon-gamma but not to IFNs alpha and beta.

Saltzman et al. (1998) demonstrated that JAK2 phosphorylates STAT1
(600555), STAT2 (600556), STAT3 (102582), STAT4 (600558), and STAT5 (see
STAT5A, 601511, and STAT5B, 604260), but not STAT6 (601512).

STAT5 is activated in a broad spectrum of human hematologic
malignancies. Using a genetic approach, Schwaller et al. (2000)
addressed whether activation of STAT5 is necessary for the myelo- and
lymphoproliferative disease induced by the TEL (600618)/JAK2 fusion
gene. Whereas mice transplanted with bone marrow transduced with
retrovirus expressing TEL/JAK2 developed a rapidly fatal myelo- and
lymphoproliferative syndrome, reconstitution with bone marrow derived
from Stat5a/b-deficient mice expressing TEL/JAK2 did not induce disease.
Disease induction in the Stat5a/b-deficient background was rescued with
a bicistronic retrovirus encoding TEL/JAK2 and Stat5a. Furthermore,
myeloproliferative disease was induced by reconstitution with bone
marrow cells expressing a constitutively active mutant, Stat5a, or a
single Stat5a target, murine oncostatin M (OSM; 165095). These data
defined a critical role for STAT5A/B and OSM in the pathogenesis of
TEL/JAK2 disease.

In addition to its role as a kidney cytokine regulating hematopoiesis,
erythropoietin (133170) is also produced in the brain after oxidative or
nitrosative stress. The transcription factor HIF1 (603348) upregulates
erythropoietin following hypoxic stimuli. Digicaylioglu and Lipton
(2001) demonstrated that preconditioning with erythropoietin protects
neurons in models of ischemic and degenerative damage due to
excitotoxins and consequent generation of free radicals, including
nitric oxide. Activation of neuronal erythropoietin receptors (EPOR;
133171) prevents apoptosis induced by NMDA or nitric oxide by triggering
crosstalk between the signaling pathways JAK2 and NFKB (see 164011).
Digicaylioglu and Lipton (2001) demonstrated that erythropoietin
receptor-mediated activation of JAK2 leads to phosphorylation of the
inhibitor of NFKB (I-kappa-B-alpha; 164008), subsequent nuclear
translocation of the transcription factor NFKB, and NFKB-dependent
transcription of neuroprotective genes. Transfection of cerebrocortical
neurons with a dominant interfering form of JAK2 or an I-kappa-B-alpha
superrepressor blocks erythropoietin-mediated prevention of neuronal
apoptosis. Thus, neuronal erythropoietin receptors activate a
neuroprotective pathway that is distinct from previously well
characterized JAK and NFKB functions. Moreover, this erythropoietin
effect may underlie neuroprotection mediated by hypoxic-ischemic
preconditioning.

Huang et al. (2001) showed that JAK2, and more specifically just its
intact N-terminal domain, binds to EPOR in the endoplasmic reticulum and
promotes its cell surface expression. This interaction was specific, as
JAK1 had no effect. Residues 32 to 58 of the JAK2 JH7 domain were
required for EPOR surface expression. Alanine scanning mutagenesis of
the EPOR membrane proximal region revealed 2 modes of EPOR-JAK2
interaction. A continuous block of EPOR residues was required for
functional, ligand-independent binding to JAK2 and cell surface receptor
expression, whereas 4 specific residues were essential in switching on
prebound JAK2 after ligand binding. Thus, in addition to its kinase
activity required for cytokine receptor signaling, JAK is also an
essential subunit required for surface expression of cytokine receptors.

Dawson et al. (2009) showed that human JAK2 is present in the nucleus of
hematopoietic cells and directly phosphorylates tyr41 (Y41) on histone
H3 (see 602810). Heterochromatin protein 1-alpha (HP1-alpha, 604478),
but not HP1-beta (604511), specifically binds to this region of H3
through its chromo-shadow domain. Phosphorylation of H3Y41 by JAK2
prevents this binding. Inhibition of JAK2 activity in human leukemic
cells decreases both the expression of hematopoietic oncogene LMO2
(180385) and the phosphorylation of H3Y41 at its promoter, while
simultaneously increasing the binding of HP1-alpha at the same site.
Dawson et al. (2009) concluded that their results identified a
previously unrecognized nuclear role for JAK2 in the phosphorylation of
H3Y41 and revealed a direct mechanistic link between 2 genes, JAK2 and
LMO2, involved in normal hematopoiesis and leukemia.

Mullighan et al. (2009) reported a recurring interstitial deletion of
pseudoautosomal region 1 of chromosomes X and Y in B-progenitor ALL
(613035) that juxtaposes the first, noncoding exon of P2RY8 (300525)
with the coding region of CRLF2 (300357). They identified the
P2RY8/CRLF2 fusion in 7% of individuals with B-progenitor ALL and 53% of
individuals with ALL associated with Down syndrome. CRLF2 alteration was
associated with activating JAK mutations, and expression of human
P2RY8/CRLF2 together with mutated mouse Jak2 resulted in constitutive
JAK-STAT activation and cytokine-independent growth of Ba/F3 cells
overexpressing IL7 receptor-alpha (IL7R; 146661). Mullighan et al.
(2009) concluded that rearrangement of CRLF2 and JAK mutations together
contribute to leukemogenesis in B-progenitor ALL.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Polycythemia vera (263300), thrombocythemia (THCYT3; 614521), and
idiopathic myelofibrosis (254450) are clonal myeloproliferative
disorders arising from a multipotent progenitor. The loss of
heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 9p in myeloproliferative disorders
suggested that 9p harbors a mutation that contributes to the cause of
clonal expansion of hematopoietic cells in these diseases. Baxter et al.
(2005) and Kralovics et al. (2005) found that a high proportion of
patients with these myeloproliferative disorders carried a dominant
somatic gain-of-function val617-to-phe mutation in the JAK2 gene (V617F;
147796.0001).

James et al. (2005) identified a somatic V617F mutation in 40 of 45
patients with polycythemia vera. They found that the mutation leads to
constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation activity that promotes cytokine
hypersensitivity and induces erythrocytosis in a mouse model.

Using granulocyte-based mutation screening in 220 patients with either
polycythemia vera or myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia, Tefferi et
al. (2005) identified 21 patients who were homozygous for the V617F
mutation of JAK2; 13 had polycythemia vera and 8 had myelofibrosis with
myeloid metaplasia. Kralovics et al. (2005) proposed a 2-step model for
the role of JAK2 (V617F) in the clonal evolution of myeloproliferative
disorders. The first step consists, in their view, of a G-to-T mutation
in 1 allele of the JAK2 gene that is acquired as a somatic mutation in a
hematopoietic progenitor cell or stem cell. This cell gives rise to a
clone that is heterozygous for V617F and expands to replace
hematopoietic cells without the JAK2 mutation. The second step consists
of a mitotic recombination in 1 of the progenitor cells or stem cells
heterozygous for the JAK2 mutation that generates uniparental disomy and
homozygosity for JAK2 (V617F) in 1 of the 2 daughter cells. This
daughter cell gives rise to a clone that is homozygous for V617F and
expands to replace heterozygous hematopoietic cells.

Lee et al. (2006) identified heterozygosity for mutations in the JAK2
gene (V617F and K607N, 147796.0002) in bone marrow aspirates from 3
(2.7%) of 113 unrelated patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML;
601626). JAK2 mutations were not found in 94 ductal breast carcinomas,
104 colorectal carcinomas, or 217 nonsmall cell lung cancers.

Scott et al. (2007) searched for new mutations in members of the JAK and
signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT; see 600555) gene
families in patients with V617F-negative polycythemia vera or idiopathic
erythrocytosis (see 133100). They identified 4 somatic gain-of-function
mutations affecting exon 12 of JAK2 in 10 of the V617F-negative
patients. Those with a JAK2 exon 12 mutation presented with an isolated
erythrocytosis and distinctive bone marrow morphology, and several also
had reduced serum erythropoietin levels. Erythroid colonies could be
grown from their blood samples in the absence of exogenous
erythropoietin. All such erythroid colonies were heterozygous for the
mutation, whereas colonies homozygous for the mutation occur in most
patients with V617F-positive polycythemia vera. BaF3 cells expressing
the murine erythropoietin receptor and also carrying exon 12 mutations
could proliferate without added interleukin-3 (147740). They also
exhibited increased phosphorylation of JAK2 and extracellular
signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1; 176872) and 2 (ERK2; 176948), as
compared with cells transduced by wildtype JAK2 or V617F JAK2. Three of
the exon 12 mutations included a substitution of leucine for lysine at
position 539 of JAK2 (147796.0003). This mutation resulted in a
myeloproliferative phenotype, including erythrocytosis, in a murine
model of retroviral bone marrow transplantation.

Bercovich et al. (2008) identified somatic JAK2 mutations in 16 (18%) of
88 patients with Down syndrome (190685)-associated acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL). Only 1 of 109 patients with non-Down syndrome-associated
leukemia had the mutation, but this child was also found to have an
isochromosome 21q. All the JAK2-associated leukemias were of the B-cell
precursor type. Children with a JAK2 mutation were younger (mean age,
4.5 years) compared to patients without JAK2 mutations (8.6 years) at
diagnosis. Five mutant JAK2 alleles were identified, each affecting a
highly conserved residue: arg683 (i.e., R683G, R683S, R683K). In vitro
functional expression studies in mouse hematopoietic progenitor cells
showed that the mutations caused constitutive Jak/Stat activation and
cytokine-independent growth, consistent with a gain of function. This
growth was sensitive to pharmacologic inhibition with a JAK inhibitor.
Modeling studies showed that arg683 is located in an exposed conserved
region of the JAK2 pseudokinase domain in a region different from that
implicated in myeloproliferative disorders. Bercovich et al. (2008)
concluded that there is a specific association between constitutional
trisomy 21 and arg683 JAK2 mutations that predisposes to the development
of B-cell ALL in patients with Down syndrome.

- Germline JAK2 Mutation

In a case-control study of unexplained pregnancy loss (see 614389),
Mercier et al. (2007) found association between the JAK2 V617F mutation
and the risk of fetal or embryonic loss. However, Dahabreh et al. (2008)
found no evidence for increased prevalence of the JAK2 V617F mutation in
women with a history of recurrent miscarriage.

By genomewide analysis of 181 individuals with polycythemia vera or
essential thrombocytosis, Kilpivaara et al. (2009) identified a C-G
transversion in intron 12 (dbSNP rs10974944) that predisposed to the
development of V617F-positive myeloproliferative neoplasms. The minor G
allele of this SNP was significantly more common among 324 individuals
with polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, or primary
myelofibrosis, compared to controls (odds ratio of 3.1; p = 4.1 x
10(-20)). The V617F mutation was preferentially acquired in cis with the
predisposition allele. These data suggested that germline variations are
an important contributor to myeloproliferative phenotype and
predisposition associated with somatic mutations.

Jones et al. (2009) found that 109 (77%) of 142 alleles harboring the
JAK2 V617F mutation from patients with a myeloproliferative neoplasm had
the JAK2 46/1 haplotype, which was tagged by dbSNP rs12343867 in intron
14 and dbSNP rs12340895, compared to only 9 (12%) of the 74 residual
wildtype alleles (p = 1.4 x 10(-20)). The results indicated that
homozygosity for V617F was not random, but rather occurred
preferentially when this mutation was present on the specific JAK2
haplotype. Additional analysis in 177 heterozygous V617F carriers found
that V617F occurred more frequently on the 46/1 haplotype (135 of 354
alleles) compared to 188 controls (92 of 376 alleles; p = 0.0001) and
1,500 controls (p = 3.3 x 10(-8)). Sequencing of the products in 66
informative cases showed that 49 (74%) V617F alleles arose on the 46/1
allele, whereas only 17 (26%) wildtype alleles were on 46/1 (p = 2.1 x
10(-8)). V617F-associated disease was strongly associated with haplotype
46/1 in all 3 disease entities compared to healthy controls:
polycythemia vera (p = 2.9 x 10(-16)), essential thrombocythemia (p =
8.2 x 10(-9)), and myelofibrosis (p = 8.0 x 10(-5)). Jones et al. (2009)
concluded that the 46/1 haplotype predisposes to the development of
V617F-associated myeloproliferative neoplasms, with an overall odds
ratio of 3.7.

Olcaydu et al. (2009) also found that a JAK2 haplotype including dbSNP
rs12343867 preferentially acquired the V617F mutation and conferred
susceptibility to myeloproliferative disorders. Ninety-three (85%) of
109 individuals with myeloproliferative disorders who were heterozygous
for dbSNP rs12343867 carried the V617F mutation on the C allele (p = 7.8
x 10(-15)). Olcaydu et al. (2009) suggested that a certain combination
of SNPs may render haplotypes differentially susceptible to somatic
mutagenesis.

In affected members of a family with autosomal dominant
thrombocythemia-3 (THCYT3; 614521), Mead et al. (2012) identified a
germline heterozygous G-to-A transition in the JAK2 gene, resulting in a
val617-to-ile (V617I) substitution. The proband presented at age 53
years with an ischemic cerebrovascular event associated with
long-standing thrombocytosis (700 x 10(9) to 970 x 10(9)). There were 5
additional family members with thrombocytosis, including 1 with a
myocardial infarction at age 46 and another with a myocardial infarction
at age 65 and an ischemic cerebrovascular event at age 72. Bone marrow
biopsy showed megakaryocyte hyperplasia without fibrosis. In addition,
none of the patients had splenomegaly or evidence of leukemic
transformation. Examination of peripheral blood cells showed normal
baseline STAT3 (102582) activity and lack of cytokine-independent colony
formation. However, after stimulation with granulocyte
colony-stimulating factor (GCSF; 138970), V617I-containing CD33+ myeloid
and CD34+ stem cells showed a marked increase in STAT3 levels,
particularly in response to low levels of GCSF, suggesting that the
mutation causes limited constitutive activation with a reduced threshold
for cytokine-induced activation.

CYTOGENETICS

- ETV6/JAK2 Fusion Gene

Peeters et al. (1997) identified a t(9;12)(p24;p13) translocation in a
patient with early pre-B acute lymphoid leukemia and a
t(9;15;12)(p24;q15;p13) translocation in a patient with atypical chronic
myelogenous leukemia (CML; 608232) in transformation. Both changes
involved the ETV6 gene (600618) at 12p13 and the JAK2 gene at 9p24. In
each case different fusion mRNAs were found, with only 1 resulting in a
chimeric protein consisting of the oligomerization domain of ETV6 and
the protein tyrosine kinase domain of JAK2.

Lacronique et al. (1997) observed a t(9;12)(p24;p13) translocation in
leukemic cells from a 4-year-old boy with T-cell ALL. The 3-prime
portion of the JAK2 gene was fused to the 5-prime portion of the ETV6
gene, resulting in a protein containing the catalytic domain of JAK2 and
the oligomerization domain of ETV6. The resultant protein had
constitutive tyrosine kinase activity and conferred cytokine-independent
proliferation to a murine cell line.

ANIMAL MODEL

To assess the role of JAK2, Parganas et al. (1998) derived
Jak2-deficient mice by targeted disruption of the mouse gene in
embryonic stem cells. The mutation caused an embryonic lethality due to
the absence of definitive erythropoiesis. Fetal liver myeloid
progenitors, although present based on the expression of
lineage-specific markers, failed to respond to erythropoietin,
thrombopoietin (600044), interleukin-3 (147740), or
granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (138960). In contrast,
the response to granulocyte-specific colony-stimulating factor was
unaffected. Jak2-deficient fibroblasts failed to respond to IFN-gamma,
although the responses to IFN-alpha/beta and interleukin-6 (147620) were
unaffected. Reconstitution experiments demonstrated that Jak2 was not
required for the generation of lymphoid progenitors, their
amplification, or their functional differentiation. Parganas et al.
(1998) concluded that Jak2 plays a critical, nonredundant role in the
function of a specific group of cytokine receptors.

Neubauer et al. (1998) also performed a targeted inactivation of Jak2 in
mice. Jak2 -/- embryos were anemic and died around day 12.5 postcoitum.
Primitive erythrocytes were found, but definitive erythropoiesis was
absent. Compared to erythropoietin receptor-deficient mice, the
phenotype of Jak2 deficiency was more severe. Fetal liver BFU-E and
CFU-E colonies were completely absent. However, multilineage
hematopoietic stem cells (CD34-low, c-kit-pos) were found, and B
lymphopoiesis appeared intact. In contrast to IFN-alpha stimulation,
Jak2 -/- cells did not respond to IFN-gamma. Jak2 -/- embryonic stem
cells were competent for LIF signaling. These data also demonstrated
that Jak2 has pivotal functions for signal transduction of a set of
cytokine receptors required in definitive erythropoiesis.

---Polycythemia Vera, Thrombocytopenia, Myelofibrosis, or Erythrocytosis

In 71 (97%) of 73 patients with polycythemia vera (PV; 263300), 29 (57%)
of 51 with essential thrombocythemia (THCYT3; 614521), and 8 (50%) of 16
with idiopathic myelofibrosis (254450), Baxter et al. (2005) identified
a somatic G-to-T transversion in the JAK2 gene, resulting in a
val617-to-phe (V617F) substitution in the negative regulatory JH2
domain. The mutation was predicted to dysregulate kinase activity. It
was heterozygous in most patients, homozygous in a subset as the result
of mitotic recombination, and arose in a multipotent progenitor capable
of giving rise to erythroid and myeloid cells.

In all 51 patients with loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) of chromosome 9p,
Kralovics et al. (2005) identified a somatic V617F mutation. Of 193
patients without 9p LOH, 66 were heterozygous for V617F and 127 did not
have the mutation. The frequency of V617F was 65% (83 of 128) among
patients with polycythemia vera, 57% (13 of 23) among patients with
idiopathic myelofibrosis, and 23% (21 of 93) among patients with
essential thrombocythemia.

James et al. (2005) identified a somatic V617F mutation in 40 of 45
patients with polycythemia vera. They found that the mutation leads to
constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation activity that promotes cytokine
hypersensitivity and induces erythrocytosis in a mouse model.

Jamieson et al. (2006) identified the V617F mutation in peripheral blood
and bone marrow cells in 14 of 16 PV patients. In all PV peripheral
blood samples analyzed, there were increased numbers of hematopoietic
stem cells compared to controls. The V617F mutation was detected in
hematopoietic stem cells of all 6 PV samples examined further, and those
stem cells showed skewed differentiation towards the erythroid lineage.
However, the mutation was also identified in most myeloid precursor
cells examined, indicating that the mutation was clonally transmitted to
all stem cell progeny. Aberrant erythroid potential of PV stem cells was
potently inhibited by the JAK2 inhibitor AG490.

An acquired V617F mutation in JAK2 occurs in most patients with
polycythemia vera, but is seen in only half those with essential
thrombocythemia and idiopathic myelofibrosis. Campbell et al. (2005)
attempted to determine whether essential thrombocythemia patients with
the mutation are biologically distinct from those without, and why the
same mutation is associated with different disease phenotypes. The
mutation-positive patients had lower serum erythropoietin and ferritin
concentrations than did mutation-negative patients. Mutation-negative
patients did, nonetheless, show many clinical and laboratory features
characteristic of a myeloproliferative disorder. These V617F-positive
individuals were more sensitive to therapy with hydroxyurea, but not
anagrelide, than those without the JAK2 mutation. Thus, Campbell et al.
(2005) concluded that V617F-positive essential thrombocythemia and
polycythemia vera form a biologic continuum, with the degree of
erythrocytosis determined by physiologic or genetic modifiers.

---Acute Myelogeneous Leukemia

Lee et al. (2006) identified heterozygosity for the V617F mutation in
bone marrow aspirates from 2 of 113 patients with acute myelogenous
leukemia (AML; 601626). Neither patient had a history of previous
hematologic disorders and or evidence of erythroid lineage proliferation
on bone marrow biopsy.

---Susceptibility to Pregnancy Loss

Mercier et al. (2007) screened for the JAK2 V617F mutation in 3,496
pairs of women enrolled in a matched case-control study of unexplained
pregnancy loss (see RPRGL1, 614389) and found that the mutation was
significantly associated with the risk of fetal loss (OR, 4.63; p =
0.002) and embryonic loss (OR, 7.20; p = 0.009). The mutation was more
frequent in women with embryonic loss than in those with fetal loss (p
less than 0.001); clinical examination and complete blood count were
normal in all women with the mutation. The increased risks were
independent of those associated with the 1691A mutation in the factor V
Leiden gene (612309.0001) and the 20210A mutation in the prothrombin
gene (176930.0009).

Dahabreh et al. (2008) screened 389 women with a history of at least 3
consecutive early or 1 late pregnancy loss but did not find the JAK2
V617F mutation in any case; the authors concluded that latent maternal
JAK2 V617F-positive myoproliferative neoplasm is an unlikely cause of
miscarriage.

---Budd-Chiari Syndrome

Chung et al. (2006) described Budd-Chiari syndrome (600880) in a
46-year-old woman who was well until the onset of increasing abdominal
distention over a period of several days. She was found to have a
combination of the V617F mutation and the factor V Leiden mutation
(612309.0001). This JAK2 mutation was found by Patel et al. (2006) in a
high proportion of patients with the Budd-Chiari syndrome, providing
evidence that these patients have a latent myeloproliferative disorder.

Sozer et al. (2009) identified somatic homozygous V617F mutations in
liver venule endothelial and hematopoietic cells from 2 unrelated PV
patients who developed Budd-Chiari syndrome. However, analysis of
endothelial cells from a third PV patient with Budd-Chiari syndrome and
in 2 patients with hepatoportal sclerosis without PV showed only
wildtype JAK2. Endothelial and hematopoietic cells are believed to come
from a common progenitor called the hemangioblast. Sozer et al. (2009)
concluded that finding V617F-positive endothelial cells and
hematopoietic cells from patients with PV who developed Budd-Chiari
syndrome indicates that endothelial cells are involved by the PV
malignant process, and suggested that the disease might originate from a
common cell of origin in some patients.

LEUKEMIA, ACUTE MYELOGENOUS, SOMATIC
JAK2, LYS607ASN

In bone marrow aspirate from 1 of 113 patients with acute myelogenous
leukemia (AML; 601626), Lee et al. (2006) identified a heterozygous
1821G-C transversion in the twelfth coding exon (exon 14) of the JAK2
gene, resulting in a lys607-to-asn (K607N) substitution in a conserved
residue in the pseudokinase domain.

.0003
ERYTHROCYTOSIS, JAK2-RELATED, SOMATIC
JAK2, LYS539LEU

Among 10 patients with a diagnosis of polycythemia vera or idiopathic
erythrocytosis (see 133100) who did not carry the V617F mutation in JAK2
(147796.0001), Scott et al. (2007) found 3 alleles carrying a somatic
lys539-to-leu substitution (K539L) in exon 12 of the JAK2 gene. Those
with this and 3 other JAK2 exon 12 mutations presented with an isolated
erythrocytosis and distinctive bone marrow morphology, and several also
had reduced serum erythropoietin levels. Erythroid colonies could be
grown from their blood samples in the absence of exogenous
erythropoietin. All such erythroid colonies were heterozygous for the
mutation, whereas colonies homozygous for the mutation occurred in most
patients with V617F-positive polycythemia vera. The K539L mutation
resulted in a myeloproliferative phenotype, including erythrocytosis, in
a murine model of retroviral bone marrow transplantation.

.0004
THROMBOCYTHEMIA 3
JAK2, VAL617ILE

In affected members of a family with autosomal dominant
thrombocythemia-3 (THCYT3; 614521), Mead et al. (2012) identified a
germline heterozygous G-to-A transition in the JAK2 gene, resulting in a
val617-to-ile (V617I) substitution. The proband presented at age 53
years with an ischemic cerebrovascular event associated with
long-standing thrombocytosis (700 x 10(9) to 970 x 10(9)). There were 5
additional family members with thrombocytosis, including 1 with a
myocardial infarction at age 46 and another with a myocardial infarction
at age 65 and an ischemic cerebrovascular event at age 72. Bone marrow
biopsy showed megakaryocyte hyperplasia without fibrosis. In addition,
none of the patients had splenomegaly or evidence of leukemic
transformation. Examination of peripheral blood cells showed normal
baseline STAT3 (102582) activity and lack of cytokine-independent colony
formation. However, after stimulation with (GCSF; 138970),
V617I-containing CD33+ myeloid and CD34+ stem cells showed a marked
increase in STAT3 levels, particularly in response to low levels of
GCSF, suggesting that the mutation causes limited constitutive
activation with a reduced threshold for cytokine-induced activation.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Glucuronidation represents a major pathway that enhances the elimination
of many lipophilic xenobiotics and endobiotics to more water-soluble
compounds. UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs, or UDPGTs; EC 2.4.1.17)
catalyze the addition of the glycosyl group from a nucleotide sugar to a
small hydrophobic molecule (aglycone). UGT1A1 encodes the critically
important bilirubin UGT (Ritter et al., 1992).

- UGT1A Gene Complex

Several UGT1A enzymes, including UGT1A1, are encoded by the UGT1A gene
complex on chromosome 2q37. The 5-prime region of the UGT1A complex
contains 13 tandemly arrayed first exons, including 4 pseudo exons, that
are linked to 4 common exons in the UGT1A 3-prime region. Each first
exon has its own promoter element. The 9 viable first exons are
independently spliced to the common exons 2 through 5 to generate 9
UGT1A transcripts with unique 5-prime ends and identical 3-prime ends.
The N-terminal region encoded by each unique first exon determines
acceptor substrate specificity, while the 246-amino acid C-terminal
region encoded by the 4 common exons specifies interactions with the
common donor substrate, UDP-glucuronic acid (Gong et al., 2001).

Each first exon is considered a unique gene linked to the 4 common exons
in the UGT1A complex. For information on functional UGT1A proteins other
than UGT1A1, see UGT1A3 (606428), UGT1A4 (606429), UGT1A5 (606430),
UGT1A6 (606431), UGT1A7 (606432), UGT1A8 (606433), UGT1A9 (606434), and
UGT1A10 (606435). The 4 UGT1A pseudogenes are designated UGT1A2P,
UGT1A11P, UGT1A12P, and UGT1A13P.

NOMENCLATURE

For members of the UDP glycosyltransferase gene superfamily, Burchell et
al. (1991) suggested and Mackenzie et al. (1997) recommended that the
root UGT symbol be followed by an arabic number representing the family,
followed by a letter designating the subfamily, and then another arabic
number denoting the individual gene. Mackenzie et al. (1997) noted that
the UGT1 complex contains at least 12 promoters/first exons that can be
spliced and joined with common exons 2 through 5. In this nomenclature
scheme, each first exon is regarded as a distinct gene. Mackenzie et al.
(2005) provided a nomenclature update for the UGT gene superfamily.

CLONING

By screening a liver cDNA library with a probe to a conserved
transferase C-terminal sequence, followed by 5-prime RACE, Ritter et al.
(1991) obtained cDNAs encoding UGT1A1 and UGT1A4 (606429), which they
termed HUGBR1 and HUGBR2, respectively. Sequence analysis predicted that
the 533-amino acid UGT1A1 protein shares with UGT1A4 66% sequence
similarity in the N terminus, which contains potential N-linked
glycosylation sites, and complete identity after codon 287. Northern
blot analysis revealed expression of a 2.6-kb transcript in liver.

Wooster et al. (1991) determined the sequence of human liver UDP
glucuronosyltransferases and concluded that the bilirubin UDP
glucuronosyltransferases are derived from the same large gene as the
phenol UGTs.

Using Northern blot analysis, Basu et al. (2004) detected
tissue-specific expression of UGT1A1, UGT1A7 (606432), UGT1A8 (606433),
UGT1A9 (606434), and UGT1A10 (606435). UGT1A1 was expressed highly in
liver, moderately in regions of small intestine and rectum, and weakly
in thyroid, spinal cord, trachea, uterus, and esophagus. In situ
hybridization showed highest UGT1A1 expression in duodenal enterocytes,
with progressively lower expression in mucosal layers of ileum and
mucous-secreting goblet cells of colon.

Girard et al. (2007) stated that 9 UGT1A proteins with different
N-terminal halves are produced by alternative splicing of 13 unique
first exons to 4 common exons in the UGT1A gene complex. They showed
that 9 additional UGT1A proteins are generated by alternative splicing
resulting in inclusion of a novel common region exon, exon 5b. Girard et
al. (2007) referred to the 9 original UGT1A proteins as 'isoform-1' and
the 9 novel proteins as 'isoform-2.' UGT1A variants containing both
exons 5A and 5B have the same ORFs as those containing only exon 5B, and
thus produce isoform-2. The predicted isoform-2 proteins lack the
C-terminal transmembrane domain encoded by exon 5A, but the 10 amino
acids encoded by exon 5B contain a typical dilysine motif for
endoplasmic reticulum retention. RT-PCR showed that all UGT1A splice
variants were widely expressed in a tissue-specific manner. Exon
5B-containing transcripts were most often coexpressed with their
respective exon 5A-containing transcripts, although there were
exceptions. Western blot analysis of microsomes from human tissues
detected UGT1A isoform-1 and -2 proteins of 55 and 45 kD, respectively.
Both UGT1A1 isoforms were expressed in intestine, ileum, and jejunum
microsomes, whereas only isoform-1 of UGT1A1 was expressed in liver
microsomes, and only isoform-2 of UGT1A1 was expressed in kidney
microsomes. Girard et al. (2007) stated that expression of UGT1A1
isoform-1 and -2 proteins also varied significantly among individuals.
Endoglycosylation experiments with microsomes from transfected human
embryonic kidney cells showed that both UGT1A isoforms were
glycosylated. RT-PCR detected Ugt1a variants containing a homologous
exon 5b in rat and monkey liver cDNA libraries, suggesting that the
splicing mechanism that produces UGT1A isoform-2 is conserved.

GENE STRUCTURE

- UGT1A Gene Complex

The UGT1 gene contains at least 12 different promoters/first exons that
are spliced to common exons 2 through 5, thus resulting in separate
UGT1A forms with unique N termini and a conserved 246-amino acid C
terminus Ritter et al. (1992). Each of these UGT1A forms has a
distinctive substrate specificity (see Table 2 in Tukey and Strassburg
(2000)).

Moghrabi et al. (1993) schematized the organization of the UGT1 gene
complex, which involves constant and variable regions (Ritter et al.,
1992).

Gong et al. (2001) completed description of the UGT1 gene complex locus,
which spans some 218 kb. They provided evidence for 7 additional exons
1, specifying the UGT1A7 through UGT1A13P genes. Similar to the exon 1
that encodes UGT1A2P, exons 1 for the UGT1A11P through UGT1A13P genes
are pseudo. The mRNA species encoded by the exons in the extended
portion of the locus are primarily extrahepatic, with extensive
distribution in the gastrointestinal tract.

Girard et al. (2007) identified an additional UGT1A common region exon,
exon 5b, between exons 4 and 5A.

MAPPING

- UGT1A Gene Complex

Harding et al. (1989,1990) mapped the human phenol
UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, which they termed GNT1, to chromosome 2. By
human/rodent somatic cell hybridization, Moghrabi et al. (1992) mapped
the gene encoding the human phenol and bilirubin
UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT1A subfamily) to chromosome 2. By in
situ hybridization, van Es et al. (1993) mapped the gene to chromosome
2q37.

Classic breeding studies in Gunn rats suggested that bilirubin UGT and
phenol UGT genes are linked on the same chromosome (Nagai et al., 1988).
By study of recombinant inbred mice strains, Miles et al. (1991) mapped
the phenol UGT gene in the mouse, Ugt1, to chromosome 1 in a region of
homology to human chromosome 2. By linkage studies using restriction
fragment length variations (RFLVs) detected in the bilirubin
UDP-glucuronosyltransferase gene by means of a rat cDNA probe, Sato et
al. (1992) likewise mapped the gene to mouse chromosome 1.

GENE FUNCTION

Functional analysis by Ritter et al. (1991) showed that UGT1A1 had
glucuronidating activity.

In a review of the UGTs, Tukey and Strassburg (2000) indicated that
UGT1A1 is the only isoform with bilirubin as its preferred substrate.
UGT1A1 also has moderate activity on simple phenols, flavones, and C18
steroids. It has low activity with complex phenols and coumarins.

By Northern blot analysis, Strassburg et al. (1997) showed that UGT1A1,
as well as other liver UGTs, including UGT1A3 (606428), UGT1A4 (606429),
and UGT1A9 (606434), but not UGT1A6 (606431), are downregulated in
malignant hepatocellular carcinoma.

Because there is an inverse relationship between serum bilirubin
concentrations and the risk of coronary artery disease, Lin et al.
(2003) carried out a genomewide scan in a Framingham Heart Study. Their
study sample consisted of 330 families with 1,394 sib pairs, 681 cousin
pairs, and 89 avuncular pairs. Using variance-component methods, the
heritability was estimated to be 49% +/- 6%, and the genome scan
demonstrated significant evidence of linkage of serum bilirubin to
chromosome 2q, with a lod score of 3.8 at location 243 cM. The peak
multipoint lod score is located 1 cM away from the UGT1A1 gene. Lin et
al. (2003) concluded that UGT1A1 may be a major gene controlling serum
bilirubin levels in the population.

Basu et al. (2004) showed that UGT1A1, UGT1A7, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, and
UGT1A10 metabolized a broad range of chemicals, predominantly
flavonoids, anthraquinones, hydrocarbons, and simple phenols. They also
exhibited different pH optima according to the particular substrate and
differed in their responses to high substrate concentrations. UGT1A1 was
predominantly active at pH 6.4.

Girard et al. (2007) showed that all UGT1A isoform-2 proteins were
enzymatically inactive against classical UGT1A substrates when using
UDP-glucuronic acid as cosubstrate. However, glycosyltransferase
activity of the isoform-1 proteins of UGT1A1, UGT1A7, UGT1A8, and UGT1A9
was significantly reduced when they were coexpressed with their
respective isoform-2 protein. Girard et al. (2007) concluded that UGT1A
isoform-2 proteins act as negative modulators of the active UGT1A
isoform-1 proteins.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Serum Level of Bilirubin Quantitative Trait Locus

Johnson et al. (2009) combined results from 3 genomewide association
studies (Framingham Heart Study, Rotterdam Study, and AGES-Reykjavik) to
assess genetic factors affecting serum bilirubin levels (601816) in
9,464 individuals. Metaanalysis showed strong replication of a genetic
influence at the UGT1A1 locus for a G-T transversion dbSNP rs6742078
(191740.0025; combined p value less than 5.0 x 10(-324)). In a subset of
490 individuals with UGT1A1*28 (191740.0011) and dbSNP rs6742078
genotypes available, they found the markers to be in high linkage
disequilibrium, suggesting the signal may be attributed to the UGT1A1*28
polymorphism. The dbSNP rs6742078 variant in the UGT1A1 gene explained
18% of the variation in total serum bilirubin levels.

Suhre et al. (2011) reported a comprehensive analysis of
genotype-dependent metabolic phenotypes using a GWAS with nontargeted
metabolomics. They identified 37 genetic loci associated with blood
metabolite concentrations, of which 25 showed effect sizes that were
unusually high for GWAS and accounted for 10 to 60% differences in
metabolite levels per allele copy. These associations provided new
functional insights for many disease-related associations that had been
reported in previous studies, including those for cardiovascular and
kidney disorders, type 2 diabetes, cancer, gout, venous thromboembolism,
and Crohn disease. Suhre et al. (2011) identified dbSNP rs887829 in the
UGT1A gene as associated with bilirubin/oleoylcarnitine ratio with a p
value of 2.9 x 10(-74).

- Inherited Disorders of Unconjugated Hyperbilirubinemia

Mutations in the UGT1A1 gene are responsible for both type I and type II
Crigler-Najjar syndromes (218800, 606785) as well as for the more common
mild hyperbilirubinemia known as Gilbert syndrome (143500) (Kadakol et
al., 2000). Patients with type I do not respond to phenobarbital
treatment and only traces of bilirubin glucuronides can be found in
their bile. Both Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II and Gilbert syndrome
patients have reduced bilirubin transferase activity and are responsive
to phenobarbital administration. Mutations in UGT1A1 are also
responsible for some cases of breastfeeding jaundice (237900), which may
be an infantile and inducible phenotype of Gilbert syndrome (Maruo et
al., 2000).

In a patient with Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I, Ritter et al. (1992)
identified a homozygous deletion in the UGT1A1 gene (191740.0001). The
patient was born of consanguineous parents.

Moghrabi et al. (1993) identified a homozygous mutation in the UGT1A1
gene (191740.0004) in an 11-month-old male patient, born of
consanguineous Pakistani parents, with Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I.
The patient had total absence of all phenol/bilirubin UGT proteins and
their activities in liver homogenate by enzymologic and immunochemical
analysis.

Seppen et al. (1994) showed that the 2 types of Crigler-Najjar syndrome
could be discriminated on the basis of expression of mutant cDNA in COS
cells. All type I patients examined had completely inactive enzymes; the
patients with type II had only partially inactivated enzyme. In one type
II patient, there was 4.4% residual activity and in a second, 38%
residual activity.

In affected members of 2 presumably unrelated Japanese families with
Gilbert syndrome, Koiwai et al. (1995) identified a heterozygous
mutation in the UGT1A gene (191470.0010). Expression studies in COS
cells demonstrated approximately 14% of normal UGT activity, whereas
enzymatic activity in the patient was approximately 30% of normal,
suggesting a dominant-negative effect.

In 10 patients with Gilbert syndrome, Bosma et al. (1995) identified a
homozygous 2-bp insertion (TA) in the TATAA element of the 5-prime
promoter region of the UGT1A1 gene (191470.0011). Normally, an A(TA)6TAA
element is present between nucleotides -23 and -38. All 10 patients were
homozygous for the sequence A(TA)7TAA; this resulted in reduced
expression of the gene. The (TA)7 allele was found to have a frequency
of 40% among normal controls, indicating that it is a polymorphism.
Thus, the promoter mutation appeared to be a necessary but not
sufficient factor in Gilbert syndrome.

Yamamoto et al. (1998) identified mutations in the UGT1A1 gene (see,
e.g., 191740.0010; 191740.0011) in 7 Japanese patients from 5 unrelated
families with Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II.

Maruo et al. (2000) identified mutations in the UGT1A1 gene in patients
with transient familial neonatal hyperbilirubinemia; some of the same
mutations (e.g., 191740.0011) had been found in patients with Gilbert
syndrome.

Petit et al. (2005) described paternal isodisomy for chromosome 2 as the
cause of Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I. The affected child had a
homozygous trinucleotide deletion in exon 1 resulting in the deletion of
1 of the 2 adjacent phenylalanine residues at position 170 or 171 of the
protein (191740.0006). The father was heterozygous for the mutation. The
father and child were both homozygous for the wildtype allele A(TA)6TAA
in the promoter of the UGT1A1 gene. The mother had no mutation in the
coding region of the UGT1A1 gene and was homozygous for the A(TA)7TAA
mutant allele.

Petit et al. (2006) identified 15 different mutations, including 4 novel
mutations, in the UGT1A1 gene among 13 patients with Crigler-Najjar
syndrome type II.

Strassburg (2008) provided a review of the role of UGT1A1 variants in
drug metabolism and noted that the variation of glucuronidation in
patients with Gilbert syndrome impacts drug therapy, particularly with
drugs that have a narrow therapeutic spectrum.

During a clinical trial of tocilizumab, Lee et al. (2011) identified 2
patients with elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and total
bilirubin, which in the absence of a mechanistic explanation predict
increased risk of severe liver damage from pharmaceuticals (Hy's law).
Both patients were homozygous for UGT1A1*28 (191740.0011), associated
with Gilbert syndrome, and UGT1A1*60 alleles (dbSNP rs4124874).
UGT1A1*28 and 3 additional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) showed
odds ratios greater than 25 for associations with elevated bilirubin.
Lee et al. (2011) concluded that the presence of dbSNP rs6742078
(171940.0025) accounted for 32% of the total variance in bilirubin (p =
2.2 x 10(-53)). Since these elevations in bilirubin occurring with
tocilizumab are not associated with hepatotoxicity, Lee et al. (2011)
suggested the value of genotyping in the clinical trial setting.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Based on more than 50 UGT1A1 disease-causing mutations, Kadakol et al.
(2000) presented a correlation of structure to function of UGT1A1. A
common insertion mutation of the TATAA element upstream of UGT1A1
(191740.0011) results in a reduced level of expression. Homozygosity for
this variant promoter is required for Gilbert syndrome, but is not
sufficient for manifestation of hyperbilirubinemia, which is partly
dependent on the rate of bilirubin production. Several structural
mutations of UGT1A1, e.g., G71R (191740.0016), had been reported to
cause mild reduction of UGT activity toward bilirubin, consistent with
Gilbert syndrome. When the normal allele of a heterozygote carrier for a
Crigler-Najjar-type structural mutation contains a Gilbert-type
promoter, intermediate levels of hyperbilirubinemia may be observed,
consistent with the diagnosis of Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II.
Mackenzie et al. (1997) stated that more than 40 different deleterious
mutations distributed both in the unique and common exons of the UGT1A1
gene had been found in Crigler-Najjar syndrome types I and II.

Kadakol et al. (2001) reported 4 families with unconjugated
hyperbilirubinemia. In one family, 2 infants compound heterozygous for
the promoter mutation and a structural mutation of the UGT1A1 gene
(191740.0020) presented with neonatal hyperbilirubinemia sufficiently
severe to cause kernicterus. In another family, compound heterozygosity
for the promoter mutation and a missense mutation presented with mild
hyperbilirubinemia. In a third family, homozygosity for both the
promoter mutation and a missense mutation (191740.0021) produced
Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II.

Sugatani et al. (2002) described a -3263T-G polymorphism in the
phenobarbital response enhancer module (PBREM) in the UGT1A1 promoter
with a frequency of 0.17 in the Japanese population. The polymorphism
reduced transcriptional activity to 60% of normal. As the study by
Ueyama et al. (1997) suggested that A(TA)7TAA alone is not the major
cause of Gilbert syndrome and might be genetically linked to an
unidentified defect, Maruo et al. (2004) tested the linkage of the 2
polymorphic mutations in 11 Caucasians and 12 Japanese patients who were
homozygous for A(TA)7TAA. All 23 patients were also homozygous for the
previously described polymorphism, which the authors referred to as
T-3279G, indicating that -3263T-G and A(TA)7TAA were linked. Maruo et
al. (2004) concluded that the decrease in transcription caused by both
mutations together may be essential to Gilbert syndrome.

Severe toxicity is commonly observed in cancer patients receiving
irinotecan (CPT-11). UGT1A1 catalyzes the glucuronidation of
7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38), the active metabolite of
irinotecan. Innocenti et al. (2004) found that grade 4 neutropenia was
much more common in patients with the TA indel 7/7 genotype (3 of 6
patients) compared with 6/7 (3 of 24 patients) and 6/6 (0 of 29
patients) (P = 0.001). The relative risk of grade 4 neutropenia was 9.3
for the 7/7 patients versus the rest of the patients. Pretreatment total
bilirubin levels were significantly higher in patients with grade 4
neutropenia compared to those without grade 4 neutropenia. The -3156G-A
variant seemed to distinguish different phenotypes of total bilirubin
within the TA indel genotypes. It was suggested that the -3156G-A
variant may be a better predictor of UGT1A1 status than the previously
reported TA indel genotypes.

POPULATION GENETICS

Kaniwa et al. (2005) investigated ethnic differences in genetic
polymorphisms in UGT1A1 among African Americans, Caucasians, and
Japanese using samples obtained from 150 individuals for each
population. Seven polymorphisms including 3 SNPs in the 3-prime
untranslated region of exon 5 were genotyped. Frequency of haplotypes in
the 3 populations were compared. Differences in haplotype distribution
patterns among the 3 populations suggested the possibility of ethnic
differences in toxicity profiles of drugs detoxicated by UGT1A1. A novel
SNP, 686C-T (P229L), was found in an African American. The intrinsic
clearance of SN-38 by P229L UGT1A1 expressed in COS-1 cells was about 3%
of wildtype. The results of Western blotting and real-time RT-PCR
suggested that the low glucuronidation activity of the variant was
partly due to its low stability. Kaniwa et al. (2005) suggested that the
variant 686C-T may cause high toxicity during CPT-11 therapy or
hyperbilirubinemia in patients.

Akaba et al. (1998) reported that the G71R (191470.0016) mutation of the
UGT1 gene, which in homozygous state causes Gilbert syndrome, is
prevalent among Japanese, Korean, and Chinese populations, with a gene
frequency of 0.13, 0.23, and 0.23, respectively. Akaba et al. (1999)
showed that neonates carrying the G71R mutation have significantly
increased bilirubin levels at days 2 to 4 in a gene dose-dependent
manner and that the frequency of this mutation was significantly higher
in the neonates who required phototherapy than in those who did not.
They suggested that the G71R mutation contributes to the high incidence
of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in Japanese.

HISTORY

Hagiwara et al. (1991) used a 5-prime EcoRI fragment of a cDNA cloned by
Jackson et al. (1987) to map what they presumed to be the bilirubin
glucuronosyltransferase. They concluded that the gene is located on
chromosome 1 by study of sorted chromosomes and narrowed the assignment
to 1q21-q23 by high resolution in situ hybridization. However, Burchell
(1991), who without his knowledge or consent was named as an author,
reported that the probe used (prepared in his laboratory) was not
specific for bilirubin UDPGT but rather was a relatively nonspecific
probe for 6-alpha-hydroxy bile acid UGT. Both the bilirubin UGTs and
phenol UGTs are encoded by UGT1.

ANIMAL MODEL

Irinotecan (CTP-11) is an antitumor agent that was approved in 1997 for
use in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer refractory to
5-fluorouracil therapy. Irinotecan is a semisynthetic analog of the
cytotoxic alkaloid camptothecin (CPT), which is obtained from the
oriental tree Camptotheca acuminata. Irinotecan is an inhibitor of the
topoisomerase-1 enzyme (TOP1; 126420). It is biotransformed by tissue
and serum carboxyl esterases into the inactive metabolite SN-38
(7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin), which has a 100- to 1,000-fold higher
antitumor activity than irinotecan. SN-38 is glucuronidated by hepatic
UGTs. The major dose-limiting toxicity of irinotecan therapy is
diarrhea, which is believed to be secondary to the biliary excretion of
SN-38, the extent of which is determined by SN-38 glucuronidation. Iyer
et al. (1998) undertook a study to identify the specific isoform of UGT
involved in SN-38 glucuronidation. In vitro glucuronidation of SN-38 was
screened in hepatic microsomes from normal rats, normal humans, Gunn
rats, and patients with Crigler-Najjar type I syndrome (218800). A wide
intersubject variability in the in vitro SN-38 glucuronide formation
rates was found in humans. Gunn rats and Crigler-Najjar patients lacked
SN-38 glucuronidating activity. A significant correlation was observed
between SN-38 and bilirubin glucuronidation, whereas there was a poor
relationship between para-nitrophenol and SN-38 glucuronidation. In
HK293 cells, intact SN-38 glucuronidation was observed only in cells
transfected with the UGT1A1 isozyme. These findings indicated a genetic
predisposition to the metabolism of irinotecan, suggesting that patients
with low UGT1A1 activity, such as those with Gilbert syndrome, may be at
increased risk for irinotecan toxicity.

The Gunn rat is an excellent animal model of type I Crigler-Najjar
syndrome, exhibiting deletion of a single guanosine (G) within the
Ugt1a1 gene. The defect results in a frameshift and a premature stop
codon, absence of enzyme activity, and hyperbilirubinemia. Kren et al.
(1999) showed permanent correction of the Ugt1a1 genetic defect in Gunn
rat liver with site-specific replacement of the absent G residue at
nucleotide 1206 by using an RNA/DNA oligonucleotide designed to promote
endogenous repair of genomic DNA. The chimeric oligonucleotide was
either complexed with polyethylenimine or encapsulated in anionic
liposomes, administered intravenously, and targeted to the hepatocyte
via the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGR1; 108360). G insertion was
determined by PCR amplification, colony lift hybridizations, restriction
endonuclease digestion, and DNA sequencing, and confirmed by genomic
Southern blot analysis. DNA repair was specific, efficient, and stable
throughout the 6-month observation period, and was associated with
reduction of serum bilirubin levels.

Findlay et al. (2000) reported that the predominant thyroid hormone
released from the thyroid gland, T4, and the inactive rat T3 were
glucuronidated by cloned expressed bilirubin UGT1A1 and also phenol
UGT1A9. Results from Crigler-Najjar microsomal samples indicated that
UGT1A1 was the main contributor to thyroid hormone glucuronidation in
the liver, with rat T3 being the preferential substrate. In kidney
microsomes, thyroid hormone glucuronidation was more complex, suggesting
that more than just the UGT1A9 isoform may be involved. Bioactive T3 was
not significantly glucuronidated by these isoforms and other UGTs, and
sulfotransferases may have been involved.

Nguyen et al. (2008) found that Ugt1 -/- mice developed extreme jaundice
within 8 hours of birth, and all Ugt1 -/- mice died within 2 weeks. In
Ugt1 -/- mice, serum levels of unconjugated bilirubin were 40- to
60-times higher than that of Ugt1 +/- or wildtype mice, which is
comparable to that found in patients with Crigler-Najjar type I disease.
Ugt2-dependent glucuronidation activity was unaffected. Microarray
analysis showed that loss of Ugt1 in liver altered the expression of
more than 350 genes at least 1.5-fold. Genes that were affected included
those involved in cell cycle regulation, kinase regulation, fatty acid
and pyrimidine metabolism, and steroid metabolism.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CRIGLER-NAJJAR SYNDROME, TYPE I
UGT1A1, 13-BP DEL, EX2

This variant has been designated UGT1A1*2 (MacKenzie et al., 1997).

In a patient with Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I (218800), born of
consanguineous parents, Ritter et al. (1992) identified a homozygous
13-bp deletion in exon 2 of the UGT1A1 gene. Both parents were
heterozygous for the allele, which was initially referred to as UGT1*FB
for the initials of the patient. The mutation was predicted to result in
the synthesis of a severely truncated bilirubin transferase isozyme that
lacked a highly conserved sequence in the C terminus and the
characteristic membrane (endoplasmic reticulum)-anchoring segment of the
protein molecule.

.0002
CRIGLER-NAJJAR SYNDROME, TYPE I
UGT1A1, SER376PHE

This variant has been designated UGT1A1*3 (Mackenzie et al., 1997).

In a patient with type I Crigler-Najjar syndrome (218800) and deficiency
of both bilirubin-UGT and phenol-UGT activities in the liver, Bosma et
al. (1992) found a C-to-T transition in exon 4 of the UGT1A1 gene,
resulting in a ser376-to-phe (S376F) substitution.

Erps et al. (1994) identified a homozygous S376F substitution in 2
affected first cousins from a consanguineous family with Crigler-Najjar
syndrome type I. The mutation was present in all UGT1-encoded UDPGTs,
including the primary bilirubin UDPGT isoform.

.0003
CRIGLER-NAJJAR SYNDROME, TYPE I
UGT1A1, GLN331TER

This variant has been designated UGT1A1*5 (Mackenzie et al., 1997).

In a patient with type I Crigler-Najjar syndrome (218800), Bosma et al.
(1992) found a C-to-T transition 6 bp upstream from the 3-prime end of
exon 2 of the UGT1A1 gene, resulting in a gln331-to-ter (Q331X)
substitution. Although the splice sites surrounding exon 2 were normal,
mRNA analysis showed a 132-nucleotide deletion corresponding to the
skipping of exon 2 in this patient. The relationship of the Q331R
mutation and exon 2 skipping was unclear. A mutation involving the same
codon (Q331R; 191740.0005) was identified in a patient with type II
Crigler-Najjar syndrome (606785).

.0004
CRIGLER-NAJJAR SYNDROME, TYPE I
GILBERT SYNDROME, INCLUDED
UGT1A1, ARG341TER

This variant has been designated UGT1A1*10 (Mackenzie et al., 1997).

In an 11-month-old male patient, with Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I
(218800), born of consanguineous Pakistani parents, Moghrabi et al.
(1993) identified a homozygous C-to-T transition in exon 3 of the UGT1A1
gene, resulting in an arg341-to-ter (R341X) substitution. The patient
had total absence of all phenol/bilirubin UGT proteins and their
activities in liver homogenate by enzymologic and immunochemical
analysis.

Maruo et al. (2003) reported a Chinese girl with Crigler-Najjar syndrome
type I, born of consanguineous parents, who was homozygous for the R341X
mutation, which resulted from a 1021C-T transition. Family members
heterozygous for the R341X mutation were asymptomatic. However, 3 family
members with Gilbert syndrome (143500) were found to be compound
heterozygous for R341X and a complex allele containing 2 mutations
(P229Q; 191740.0010 and A(TA)7TAA; 191740.0011).

.0005
CRIGLER-NAJJAR SYNDROME, TYPE II
UGT1A1, GLN331ARG

This variant has been designated UGT1A1*9 (Mackenzie et al., 1997).

In a 72-year-old Irish man with Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II
(606785), born of consanguineous parents, Moghrabi et al. (1993)
identified a homozygous A-to-G transition in exon 2 of the UGT1A1 gene,
resulting in a gln331-to-arg (Q331R) substitution. The patient was one
of the brothers reported by Gollan et al. (1975). The diagnosis was
initially made at the age of 55 years on the basis of reduction in serum
bilirubin levels upon treatment with phenobarbitone. Despite the lack of
phenobarbital therapy until the age of 55, he exhibited no signs of
intellectual impairment; however, a slight bilateral intention tremor
and some nonspecific EEG abnormalities were detected. A mutation
resulting in a premature stop codon at Q331 had been identified in a

CRIGLER-NAJJAR SYNDROME, TYPE I
UGT1A1, PHE170DEL

This variant has been designated UGT1A1*13 (Mackenzie et al., 1997).

In a patient with Crigler-Najjar type I (218800), Ritter et al. (1993)
identified a deletion of a phenylalanine codon at position 170 in exon 1
of the UGT1A1 gene, abolishing a conserved diphenylalanine. The
structure of the wildtype enzyme compared to that of the mutant
indicated that hydrophobic properties at the active center are critical
for metabolizing the lipophile-like substrate.

Rosatelli et al. (1997) identified the phe170del mutation in 5 Sardinian
patients with Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I; 2 of the 5 were sibs.
Whereas the other 3 patients were homozygous for the phe170del mutation,
the sibs were compound heterozygotes for this mutation and a 470insT
mutation (191740.0012). All but 2 heterozygotes for the phe170del
mutation showed normal serum bilirubin levels; these 2 subjects were
compound heterozygous for the sequence variation A(TA)7TAA in the
promoter region of the UGT1A gene (191740.0011).

Petit et al. (2005) described paternal isodisomy for chromosome 2 as the
cause of Crigler-Najjar type I syndrome. The affected child had a
homozygous trinucleotide deletion in exon 1 resulting in the deletion of
1 of the 2 adjacent phenylalanine residues at position 170 or 171 of the
protein and was homozygous for the wildtype allele A(TA)6TAA.

This variant has been designated UGT1A1*11 (Mackenzie et al., 1997).

In a 7-year-old girl with Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I (218800), born
of consanguineous parents, Erps et al. (1994) identified a homozygous
G-to-A transition in the UGT1A1 gene, resulting in a gly309-to-glu
(G309E) substitution. The unaffected parents and 1 sib were heterozygous
for the mutation.

This variant has been designated UGT1A1*25 (Mackenzie et al., 1997).

In a 1-year-old boy with type I Crigler-Najjar syndrome (218800), Aono
et al. (1994) identified a homozygous 840C-A transversion in exon 1 of
the UGT1A1 gene, resulting in a cys1-to-ter (C1X) substitution. The
unaffected parents and elder brother were heterozygous for the mutation.

UGT1A1, PRO229GLN

This variant has been designated UGT1A1*27 (Mackenzie et al., 1997).

In affected members of 2 presumably unrelated Japanese families with
Gilbert syndrome (143500), Koiwai et al. (1995) identified a
heterozygous 686C-A transversion in the UGT1A gene, resulting in a
pro229-to-gln (P229Q) substitution. Expression studies in COS cells
demonstrated approximately 14% of normal UGT activity, whereas enzymatic
activity in the patient was approximately 30% of normal, suggesting a
dominant-negative effect. Since, according to Peters et al. (1984), UGT
exists as a tetramer on the luminal surface of the endoplasmic
reticulum, the reduced level of UGT activity in the patient with Gilbert
syndrome may be explained by the random formation of complexes of
mutated UGT subunits and normally active UGT subunits on the endoplasmic
reticulum.

In a patient with Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II (606785), Yamamoto et
al. (1998) identified a complex genotype consisting of heterozygosity
for the P229Q mutation and homozygosity for a 2-bp insertion mutation
(191740.0011).

Udomuksorn et al. (2007) found that the P229Q mutant protein reduced the
in vitro clearance for total bilirubin glucuronidation by 70% by
increasing Km and decreasing Vmax. The magnitude of decreases in
clearance for other substrates varied according to substrate.

UGT1A1, 2-BP INS, TA, TATAA ELEMENT

This variant has been designated UGT1A1*28 (Mackenzie et al., 1997).

In 10 patients with Gilbert syndrome (143500), Bosma et al. (1995)
identified a homozygous 2-bp insertion (TA) in the TATAA element of the
5-prime promoter region of the UGT1A1 gene. Normally, an A(TA)6TAA
element is present between nucleotides -23 and -38. All 10 patients were
homozygous for the sequence A(TA)7TAA; this resulted in reduced
expression of the gene. The (TA)7 allele was found to have a frequency
of 40% among normal controls, indicating that it is a polymorphism.
Thus, the promoter mutation appeared to be a necessary but not
sufficient factor in Gilbert syndrome.

Bosma et al. (1995) found that 2 related individuals with Crigler-Najjar
syndrome type II (606785) who were homozygous for a structural mutation
in the UGT1A1 gene (Bosma et al., 1993) were also both homozygous for
the wildtype A(TA)6TAA allele. Among 10 family members who were
heterozygous for the coding mutation, the other allele contained the
(TA)7 element in 6 and the (TA)6 element in 4. The 6 heterozygotes with
the promoter abnormality had significantly higher serum bilirubin values
than the 4 with the normal TATAA element.

Kaplan et al. (1997) found that neonates with G6PD Mediterranean
deficiency (305900.0006) who were heterozygous or homozygous for the
variant (TA)7 UGT1A1 allele had a higher incidence of hyperbilirubinemia
than corresponding controls. Among those normal for G6PD, the UGT1A1
polymorphism had no significant effect. Neither G6PD deficiency nor the
variant UGT1A1 promoter alone increased the incidence of
hyperbilirubinemia, but in combination both did. This gene interaction
illustrated the paradigm of interaction of benign genetic polymorphisms
in the causation of disease.

Beutler et al. (1998) described this variant in the promoter of the
UGT1A1 gene as responsible for most cases of Gilbert syndrome.

In a patient with Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II, Yamamoto et al.
(1998) identified an usual genotype consisting of heterozygosity for a
P229Q mutation (191740.0010) and homozygosity for the 2-bp insertion
mutation.

The (TA)7 mutation of the UGT1A1 gene had been associated with increased
bilirubin levels in normal persons (Bosma et al., 1995), in those with
heterozygous beta-thalassemia (Galanello et al., 1997) or G6PD
deficiency (Sampietro et al., 1997), and with neonatal icterus in G6PD
deficiency (Kaplan et al., 1997) and hereditary spherocytosis (Iolascon
et al., 1998).

Beutler et al. (1998) examined the genotypes for the (TA)7 mutation in
persons of Asian, African, and Caucasian ancestry. Although within the
Caucasian ethnic group there was a strong correlation between promoter
repeat number and bilirubin level, between ethnic groups they found that
this relationship was inverse. Among people of African ancestry, there
were, in addition to those with 6 and 7 repeats, also persons who had 5
or 8 repeats. Using a reporter gene they showed that there is an inverse
relationship between the number of TA repeats and the activity of the
promoter through the range of 5 to 8 TA repeats. An incidental finding
was a polymorphism at nucleotide -106, tightly linked to the (TA)5
haplotype. Serum bilirubin levels are influenced by many factors, both
genetic and environmental. Beutler et al. (1998) suggested that the
unstable UGT1A1 polymorphism may serve to 'fine tune' the plasma
bilirubin level within population groups, maintaining it at a high
enough level to provide protection against oxidative damage, but at a
level that is sufficiently low to prevent kernicterus in infants.

In addition to the known common UGT1A1 TATA alleles (TA6 and TA7),
Monaghan et al. (1999) identified a novel TATA allele (TA5) in a neonate
with very prolonged jaundice. Statistical analysis of TATA genotype
distributions within a group of breastfed neonates revealed significant
differences among the acute, prolonged, and very prolonged subgroups:
the incidence of familial hyperbilirubinemia genotypes (7/7 and 5/7) was
5 times greater in very prolonged cases (31%) relative to acute cases
(6%). Neonates with prolonged jaundice from family pedigrees were
observed to demonstrate the Gilbert syndrome phenotype as children or
young adults.

Kaplan et al. (2000) investigated whether the UGT promoter polymorphism
would increase hyperbilirubinemia in direct Coombs-negative ABO (see
110300)-incompatible neonates, as seen in other combinations with this
condition. Forty ABO-incompatible and 334 ABO-compatible controls had an
allele frequency of 0.35 for the variant promoter gene. The incidence of
hyperbilirubinemia was significantly higher only in the ABO-incompatible
group who were also homozygous for the variant UGT promoter, compared
with ABO-incompatible babies homozygous for the normal UGT promoter (43%
vs 0.0; p of 0.02), and compared with ABO-compatible controls of all UGT
genotypes combined (relative risk, 5.65; 95% CI, 2.23 to 14.31). Kaplan
et al. (2000) concluded that Gilbert syndrome is a determining factor
for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in ABO incompatibility.

Maruo et al. (2000) analyzed 17 breastfed Japanese infants with apparent
prolonged jaundice (serum bilirubin greater than 10 mg/dL at age 3 weeks
to 1 month). When breastfeeding was stopped, the serum bilirubin levels
began to decrease in all cases, but when breastfeeding was resumed, the
serum bilirubin concentration again became elevated in some infants.
Serum bilirubin levels normalized by the time the infants were 4 months
old. Sequencing of UGT1A1 revealed that 1 infant was a compound
heterozygote for this TATA box variant and the G71R missense mutation
(191740.0016).

Kadakol et al. (2001) found compound heterozygosity for the Gilbert-type
promoter and a structural mutation of the UGT1A1 gene (191740.0020) in
18-month-old twins with severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia resulting in
kernicterus. They also found the promoter mutation in compound
heterozygosity with a missense mutation resulting in mild
hyperbilirubinemia. Homozygosity for both the Gilbert-type promoter and
a missense mutation (191740.0021) resulted in Crigler-Najjar syndrome
type II.

In a young girl with Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II, Labrune et al.
(2002) found homozygosity for a (TA)8 polymorphism and an asn400-to-asp
mutation (191740.0022).

In a study of 67 patients with sickle cell anemia (603903) in Brazil,
Fertrin et al. (2003) found that TA6/TA7 heterozygotes and TA7/TA7
homozygotes had higher bilirubin levels; both groups had a higher
probability of presenting symptomatic cholelithiasis (600803) than
TA6/TA6 homozygotes, but this finding was only statistically significant
in the TA6/TA7 heterozygotes.

Using a novel PCR method termed fluorescence resonance energy transfer
(FRET), Borlak et al. (2000) reported the (TA)6 and (TA)7 UGT1A1
genotypes of 265 unrelated healthy individuals from southern Germany.
Genotype distribution was 43:45:12 for (TA)6/(TA)6, (TA)6/(TA)7, and
(TA)7/(TA)7, respectively. Serum total bilirubin levels increased with
presence of the (TA)7 allele; median micromoles per liter were 12.0,
14.0, and 20.5, respectively, which was a statistically significant
difference. Prevalence for the homozygous (TA)7 genotype was 12.4%.
Borlak et al. (2000) emphasized the clinical importance of the UGT1A1
genotype and function of the enzyme, particularly for drug metabolism.

Roses (2004) pointed to an example of a mild adverse event with a clear
genetic component that could be used as a model of the safe use of
pharmacogenetics. Some patients in a trial of tranilast, a specific drug
to retard coronary artery restenosis after surgery, under investigation
by GlaxoSmithKline, developed hyperbilirubinemia. A screen for variants
in candidate genes revealed that high levels of bilirubin were most
common in patients who were homozygous for the 7-repeat UGT1A1 allele.
Breaking the placebo- versus the drug-treated codes at the end of the
trial showed that all 7-7 patients who developed hyperbilirubinemia
received the drug, whereas none of the 7-7 patients treated with the
placebo developed the adverse event. Several drug-treated patients with
the 6-7 genotype also developed mildly elevated levels of bilirubin, but
no treated or placebo patients with the 6-6 genotype became
hyperbilirubinemic.

A study of UGT1A1 gene polymorphism by Edison et al. (2005) showed that
the TA(7) variant was associated with hyperbilirubinemia in homozygous
HbE patients homozygous for the hemoglobin E gene (HBE; 141900.0071).
The role of the TA(7) polymorphism of UGT1A1 in the determination of
jaundice and gallstones in hemoglobin E beta-thalassemia had been
pointed out by Premawardhena et al. (2001) in studies from Sri Lanka.
The same group (Premawardhena et al., 2003) studied the global
distribution of length polymorphisms of the promoters of the UGT1A1
gene. They found that homozygosity for the TA(7) allele occurred in 10
to 25% of the populations of Africa and the Indian subcontinent, with a
variable frequency in Europe. It occurred at a much lower frequency in
Southeast Asia, Melanesia, and the Pacific Islands, ranging from 0 to
5%. African populations showed a much greater diversity of length
alleles than other populations. These findings defined those populations
with a high frequency of hemoglobin E beta-thalassemia and related
disorders that are at increased risk for hyperbilirubinemia and
gallbladder disease. Beutler et al. (1998) had suggested that the wide
diversity in the frequency of the UGT1A1 promoter alleles might reflect
a balanced polymorphism mediated through the protective effect of
bilirubin against oxidative damage.

French et al. (2005) genotyped 126 children with newly diagnosed acute
lymphoblastic leukemia at 16 well-characterized functional
polymorphisms. The UGT1A1*28 polymorphism was a significant predictor of
global gene expression, dividing patients based on their germline
genotypes. Genes whose expression distinguished the TA 7/7 genotype from
the other UGT1A1 genotypes included HDAC1 (601241), RELA (164014) and
SLC2A1 (138140). Although UGT1A1 expression is concentrated in liver, it
is involved in the conjugation (and thus transport, excretion, and
lipophilicity) of a broad range of endobiotics and xenobiotics, which
French et al. (2005) suggested could plausibly have consequences for
gene expression in different tissues.

Using a competitive electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), Hsieh
et al. (2007) demonstrated that mutant TA7 TATA-box-like sequence has
reduced binding affinity for nuclear binding complex and for
TATA-binding protein compared to wildtype TA6; quantitative EMSA showed
that the binding affinity progressively decreases as the number of TA
repeats in the TATA-box-like sequence increases. Hsieh et al. (2007)
stated that this decrease in binding affinity causes the reduced
promoter activity of mutant UGT1A1 compared to wildtype and explains the
pathogenesis of Gilbert syndrome.

In a population-based study examining serum total bilirubin (BILIQTL1;
601816) in 3 Asian groups from Xinjiang, China, including 502 Kazakh
herdsmen, 769 Uygur farmers, and 789 Han farmers, Lin et al. (2009)
found a significant association with 2 polymorphisms in the UGT1A1 gene:
the TA(n) repeat polymorphism and dbSNP rs4148323 (191740.0016) (p =
2.05 x 10(-26) and p = 5.21 x 10(-16) respectively). The TA(7) allele
and the A allele of dbSNP rs4148323 were independently associated with
increased total bilirubin levels. Combined, these SNPs could explain
between 3.9 to 9.8% of the variance in these populations. The frequency
of the TA(7) allele was 0.134 in Han Chinese, 0.256 in the Uygur, and
0.277 in the Kazakh, which was lower than that reported for Caucasian
populations (0.357 to 0.415; Beutler et al., 1998).

gene: a 145C-T transition in exon 1 resulting in a premature stop codon,
and an A-to-G transition in the splice acceptor site of intron 3
(191740.0015). Each unaffected parent was heterozygous for one of the
mutations.

This variant is designated UGT1A1*6 and dbSNP rs4148323.

In a Japanese girl with anorexia nervosa and Gilbert syndrome (143500),
Maruo et al. (1999) identified a homozygous 211G-A transition in exon 1
of the UGT1A1 gene, resulting in a gly71-to-arg substitution (G71R). The
parents were heterozygous for the mutation.

Akaba et al. (1998) reported that the G71R mutation of the UGT1A1 gene,
which in homozygous state causes Gilbert syndrome, is prevalent among
Japanese, Korean, and Chinese populations, with a gene frequency of
0.13, 0.23, and 0.23, respectively. Akaba et al. (1999) showed that
neonates carrying the G71R mutation have significantly increased
bilirubin levels (237900) at days 2 to 4 in a gene dose-dependent manner
and that the frequency of this mutation was significantly higher in the
neonates who required phototherapy than in those who did not. They
suggested that the G71R mutation contributes to the high incidence of
neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in Japanese.

Among 20 children with acute leukemia, Kimura et al. (1999) found 4 with
intermittent unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia during the course of
combined chemotherapy. The G71R mutation was detected in the 4 patients
with hyperbilirubinemia but was not found in the other 16 patients. Two
of the 4 were heterozygotes; one was a homozygote for the G71R mutation;
and the other was a compound heterozygote for G71R and the TA insertion
mutation in the TATA box (191740.0011).

Maruo et al. (2000) analyzed 17 breastfed Japanese infants with apparent
prolonged jaundice (serum bilirubin greater than 10 mg/dL at age 3 weeks
to 1 month). When breastfeeding was stopped, the serum bilirubin levels
began to decrease in all cases, but when breastfeeding was resumed, the
serum bilirubin concentration again became elevated in some infants.
Serum bilirubin levels normalized by the time the infants were 4 months
old. Thus the infants had transient familial neonatal hyperbilirubinemia
(237900). Sequencing of the UGT1A1 gene revealed that 8 infants were
homozygous and 7 heterozygous for the G71R mutation. Another UGT1A1
missense mutation (191740.0017) was found in one of the G71R
homozygotes, and an insertion in the TATA box of UGT1A1 (191740.0011)
was found in one of the G71R heterozygotes.

Udomuksorn et al. (2007) found that the G71R mutant protein reduced the
in vitro clearance for total bilirubin glucuronidation by 50% via a
reduction in Vmax. The magnitude of decreases in clearance for other
substrates varied according to substrate.

In a population-based study examining serum total bilirubin (BILIQTL1;
601816) in 3 Asian groups from Xinjiang, China, including 502 Kazakh
herdsmen, 769 Uygur farmers, and 789 Han farmers, Lin et al. (2009)
found a significant association with 2 polymorphisms in the UGT1A1 gene:
the TA(n) repeat polymorphism (191740.0011) and dbSNP rs4148323 (p =
2.05 x 10(-26) and p = 5.21 x 10(-16) respectively). The TA(7) allele
and the A allele of dbSNP rs4148323 were independently associated with
increased total bilirubin levels. Combined, these SNPs could explain
between 3.9 to 9.8% of the variance in these populations. The frequency
of the A allele of dbSNP rs4148323 for the Han, Uygur, and Kazakh
populations was 0.211, 0.168, and 0.211, respectively, and could explain
9.8%, 4.5%, and 3.9%, respectively, of the total variation in bilirubin
levels,

Sato et al. (2013) found that 56 (14%) of 401 Japanese neonates who were
exclusively breastfed developed hyperbilirubinemia and required
phototherapy. Neonates with a 10% or greater loss of body weight since
birth had a significantly higher peak bilirubin level and incidence of
hyperbilirubinemia, higher frequency of cesarean delivery, and shorter
gestational period compared to those with less than 10% loss of body
weight. Sex and body weight at birth were not significantly different
between the 2 groups. UGT1A1 genotyping of the entire cohort showed that
the frequency of the G71R polymorphism was 0.18 and was higher in
neonates with body weight loss less than 10%. However, maximal body
weight loss during the neonatal period was the only independent risk
factor for the development of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (odds ratio of
1.25). Although presence of the G71R variant was not a significant
independent risk factor for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia overall,
subgroup analysis revealed that G71R was a risk factor only in neonates
with a 5% or greater maximal body weight loss, and the influence
correlated with the degree of body weight loss. Sato et al. (2013)
suggested that adequate feeding in the neonatal period may overcome the
genetic predisposing factor of G71R to neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.

This variant is referred to as UGT1A1*7.

In an infant with transient familial neonatal hyperbilirubinemia
associated with breastfeeding (237900), Maruo et al. (2000) found a
heterozygous T-to-G transversion in exon 5 of the UGT1A1 gene,
predicting the substitution of an aspartic acid for a tyrosine at amino
acid 486 (Y486D). This infant was also heterozygous for the G71R
mutation (191740.0016).

Udomuksorn et al. (2007) stated that homozygosity for the Y486D mutation
is associated with Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II (606785).

Udomuksorn et al. (2007) found that the Y486D mutant protein had very
low activity for in vitro clearance for total bilirubin glucuronidation.
In addition, transfection of the Y486D mutation into UGT1A6 (606431) and
UGT1A10 (606435) reduced their activity, indicating that the mutation
may alter a common UGT1A active binding site.

In 6 Tunisian patients with Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I (218800),
Francoual et al. (2002) identified a homozygous A-to-G transition in the
UGT1A1 gene, resulting in a gln357-to-arg (Q357R) substitution.
Furthermore, all 6 patients were homozygous for a TA insertion within
the promoter of the UGT1A1 gene, thus resulting in TA7/TA7 homozygosity.
All 12 parents were heterozygous for the Q357R mutation and the TA7
allele. The patients originated from different parts of Tunisia and were
not related to each other. The findings suggested that the Q357R
mutation in this group of patients was due to a founder effect.

(191740.0011) in 2 girls with Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II (606785)

UGT1A1 gene, resulting in an asn400-to-asp (N400D) mutation. Both

substitution in the UGT1A1 gene. The mutation was predicted to disrupt
the hydrophobic core of the signal peptide. Transfection studies in COS
cells found equal expression of wildtype and mutant mRNA, but the mutant
protein was expressed with 0.5% efficiency compared to the wildtype
protein.

In COS cells transfected with the L15R mutation, Ohnishi and Emi (2003)
found that the mutant protein did not relocate across the endoplasmic
reticulum membrane and was degraded rapidly with a half-life of
approximately 50 minutes, in contrast to the much longer half-life of
approximately 12.8 hours for the wildtype protein. The findings
demonstrated that the L15R mutant protein was rapidly degraded by the
proteasome owing to its mislocalization in the cell.

GILBERT SYNDROME, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
UGT1A1, -3263T-G

Sugatani et al. (2002) identified a SNP, -3263T-G, in the UGT1A1
promoter, also known as the phenobarbital-responsive enhancer module NR3
region (gtPBREM NR3). Functional studies showed that the polymorphism
decreased transcriptional activity to approximately 62% of wildtype.
Sugatani et al. (2002) identified the -3263T-G polymorphism in 21 of 25
patients with Gilbert syndrome (143500); 8 patients were homozygous and
13 were heterozygous. Five of the homozygotes were also homozygous for
the (TA)7 mutation (191740.0011). Twelve of the polymorphism
heterozygotes and 1 of the homozygotes were also heterozygous for the
G71R mutation (191740.0016). Two of the 21 patients were compound
heterozygotes for the -3263T-G polymorphism, the (TA)7 mutation, and the
G71R mutation. Of the 4 individuals with Gilbert syndrome without the
-3263T-G polymorphism, 3 had the G71R mutation (1 heterozygote and 2
homozygotes) and 1 had no detectable changes in the UGT1A1 gene. In the
control group, 8 of 27 individuals had the -3263T-G polymorphism. The
frequency of alleles carrying the polymorphism was significantly higher
in the hyperbilirubinemic group than in the control group (0.58 vs 0.17,
respectively). Plasma total bilirubin levels in the double heterozygotes
were significantly higher than those with a single mutation or
polymorphism, indicating that those individuals who are heterozygous for
the -3263T-G polymorphism and for the G71R mutation are predisposed for
hyperbilirubinemia in Gilbert syndrome.

Maruo et al. (2004), who referred to this polymorphism as T-3279G,
studied 11 Caucasians and 12 Japanese patients with Gilbert syndrome and
found that all 23 patients were homozygous for both A(TA)7TAA and
-3263T-G, indicating that the 2 polymorphisms are linked. They suggested
that the decrease of transcription caused by both mutations may be
essential to the development of Gilbert syndrome.

BILIRUBIN, SERUM LEVEL OF, QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCUS 1
UGT1A1, G-T, (dbSNP rs6742078)

Johnson et al. (2009) combined results from 3 genomewide association
studies (Framingham Heart Study, Rotterdam Study, and AGES-Reykjavik) to
assess genetic factors affecting serum bilirubin levels (601816) in
9,464 individuals. Metaanalysis showed strong replication of a genetic
influence at the UGT1A1 locus for a G-T transversion dbSNP rs6742078
(combined p value less than 5.0 x 10(-324)). In a subset of 490
individuals with UGT1A1*28 (191740.0011) and dbSNP rs6742078 genotypes
available, they found the markers to be in high linkage disequilibrium,
suggesting the signal may be attributed to the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism.
The dbSNP rs6742078 variant in the UGT1A1 gene explained 18% of the
variation in total serum bilirubin levels.

In 610 patients treated with tocilizumab plus methotrexate or another
disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), those homozygous for the
variant allele at dbSNP rs6742078 experienced an additional 0.43 mg/dl
increase in maximum bilirubin, accounting for 32% of the total
population variance in maximum change from baseline (p = 2.2 x 10(-53)).

173850	TITLE *173850 POLIOVIRUS RECEPTOR; PVR
;;PVS;;
CD155;;
NECTIN-LIKE PROTEIN 5; NECL5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PVR, or CD155, belongs to a large family of immunoglobulin (Ig)-like
molecules called nectins and nectin-like proteins, which mediate
cell-cell adhesion, cell migration, and cell polarization by homotypic
contact or heterotypic interaction with other nectins. In addition, PVR
serves as the entry receptor for poliovirus and thereby mediates human
susceptibility to poliovirus infection (summary by Fuchs et al., 2004).

CLONING

Primates are susceptible to poliomyelitis infection, but rodents are
not; furthermore, human cells but not rodent cells are killed by
poliovirus in vitro. Susceptibility to poliovirus is a function of the
presence or absence of a cellular receptor to which the virus binds as
the first step in poliovirus replication. Mendelsohn et al. (1986)
succeeded in transforming a human poliovirus receptor gene into mouse L
cells, which are ordinarily resistant to poliovirus infection because
they do not bear a poliovirus receptor. Monoclonal antibody directed
against the HeLa cell poliovirus receptor site was used in rosette
assays to identify poliovirus-sensitive transformants.

Mendelsohn et al. (1989) and Koike et al. (1990) isolated genomic and
complementary DNAs for human poliovirus receptors (PVRs) from HeLa
cells. Four mRNA isoforms, 2 membrane-bound and 2 secreted, were
identified and shown to be generated by alternative splicing from the
primary transcript. The PVRs are members of the immunoglobulin
superfamily.

Shepley et al. (1988) prepared a monoclonal antibody that identified a
100-kD membrane protein in HeLa cells and in human spinal cord involved
in poliovirus attachment. They showed that the antigen identified by the
monoclonal antibody was associated with the presence of human chromosome
19 in human-mouse hybrid cell lines. The monoclonal antibodies stained
neurons in the reticular formation and clusters of brainstem neurons,
consistent with the known pattern of damage caused by poliovirus
infection in the brainstem. Furthermore, it reacted with human
peripheral mononuclear cells, consistent with the known replication of
poliovirus in Peyer patches and tonsils.

GENE FUNCTION

By analysis of transgenic mice expressing human CD155, Gromeier et al.
(2000) observed expression of CD155 within embryonic structures giving
rise to spinal cord anterior horn motor neurons. They suggested that
this expression may explain the restrictive host cell tropism of
poliovirus for this cellular compartment of the central nervous system.

Solecki et al. (2002) noted that CD155 is aberrantly expressed in
neuroectodermal tumors. RT-PCR analysis showed that SHH (600725)
treatment of teratocarcinoma cells upregulates CDC155 and that this
upregulation requires an intact GLI (165220)-binding site. The authors
proposed that their finding might help explain the normal function of
CD155 during development and its expression in tumors.

Bottino et al. (2003) immunized mice with natural killer
(NK)-susceptible human target cells and obtained antibodies to PVR and
nectin-2 (PVRL2; 600798). Binding analysis and flow cytometry
demonstrated that both molecules bound strongly with DNAM1 (CD226;
605397), but not with other activating NK receptors, including NKp46
(NCR1; 604530) and NKp30 (NCR3; 611550). Expression of PVR or PVRL2
rendered cells susceptible to enhanced lysis in a DNAM1-dependent manner
that was nearly abrogated in the presence of antibody to PVR, PVRL2, or
DNAM1.

Using flow cytometric analysis and fluorescence microscopy, Fuchs et al.
(2004) demonstrated that NK cells recognize PVR through an additional
receptor, CD96 (606037). CD96 promoted NK cell adhesion to target cells
expressing PVR, stimulated cytotoxicity by activated NK cells, and
mediated acquisition of PVR from target cells.

By flow cytometric and immunohistochemical analysis, Reymond et al.
(2004) found that PVR and nectin-2 were expressed at cell junctions on
primary vascular endothelial cells. Binding of DNAM1 at endothelial
junctions was abrogated by anti-PVR, but not by anti-nectin-2.
Transmigration assays showed that either anti-PVR or anti-DNAM1 blocked
monocyte transmigration through endothelium, with monocyte arrest at the
apical surface of endothelium over intercellular junctions, suggesting
that the DNAM1-PVR interaction occurs during diapedesis. Reymond et al.
(2004) concluded that DNAM1 regulates monocyte extravasation via
interaction with PVR.

Tomasec et al. (2005) showed that cells infected with high-passage
cytomegalovirus (CMV) strains were more susceptible to NK cell-mediated
lysis than cells infected with low-passage CMV strains. They determined
that high-passage CMV strains, such as AD169, had spontaneous 13- to
15-kb deletions that included the UL141 gene product. Tomasec et al.
(2005) found that UL141 mediated efficient protection against a wide
range of NK populations by downregulating expression of CD155 on the NK
cell surface.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

He et al. (2000) determined the structure of the extracellular, 3-domain
PVR/CD155 molecule complexed with poliovirus at 22-angstrom resolution.

MAPPING

In a study of human-mouse hybrids, Miller et al. (1974) showed that
chromosome 19 is correlated with susceptibility to poliovirus. Siddique
et al. (1985) regionalized the PVS gene to 19q13-qter. By the study of
rodent/human hybrid cell lines carrying 4 different regions of human
chromosome 19, Siddique et al. (1988) demonstrated that the typical
cytopathic effects of poliovirus infection were observed only when the
region 19q12-q13.2 was contained as the smallest region of overlap. The
same region contains the gene for myotonic dystrophy (160900). The PVS
gene is also of interest in connection with inherited motor neuron
diseases because it encodes a cell-surface receptor expressed on motor
neurons.

Schonk et al. (1990) assigned the PVS gene to 19q13.2 by hybridization
studies using a panel of somatic cell hybrids with subchromosomal
segments of 19q. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Trask et al.
(1993) assigned the PVS gene to 19q13.2-q13.3. Seldin et al. (1991)
mapped the homologous gene in the mouse to chromosome 9.

ANIMAL MODEL

Koike et al. (1991) noted that mouse L cells are not permissive for
poliovirus infection. However, mouse L-cell transformants carrying the
human PVS gene are permissive for infection of all 3 serotypes of
poliovirus. This observation indicated that all 3 serotypes use the same
cellular receptor and that mouse cells have the cellular machinery for
poliovirus replication except for the receptor. Koike et al. (1991)
created transgenic mice carrying the human PVS gene. They demonstrated
sensitivity of the cells in the central nervous system of the transgenic
mice to poliovirus and suggested that the transgenic mice may be an
excellent animal model for studying the pathogenesis of polio and
assessing poliovirus vaccines.

607593	TITLE *607593 MEDIATOR OF DNA DAMAGE CHECKPOINT PROTEIN 1; MDC1
;;NUCLEAR FACTOR WITH BRCT DOMAINS PROTEIN 1; NFBD1;;
KIAA0170
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The MDC1 protein contains a forkhead homology-associated (FHA) domain
and 2 BRCA1 (113705) C-terminal motifs (BRCTs) and is required for the
intra-S-phase DNA damage checkpoint (Goldberg et al., 2003).

CLONING

Shang et al. (2003) identified nuclear factor with BRCT domains
protein-1 (NFBD1) as a mammalian homolog of S. cerevisiae Rad9.

By randomly sequencing cDNAs obtained from the human myeloid cell line
KG-1, Nagase et al. (1996) cloned MDC1, which they called KIAA0170. The
deduced MDC1 protein contains 2,089 amino acids. Northern blot analysis
showed that MDC1 is ubiquitously expressed.

Goldberg et al. (2003) identified MDC1 as a binding partner for the
MRE11 complex (see MRE11; 600814). They determined that the MDC1 protein
has a predicted molecular mass of 226.5 kD. It contains an FHA domain at
its N terminus and 2 BRCTs at its C terminus. The central region of MDC1
has 19 consecutive repeats of an approximately 40-amino acid motif.

Stewart et al. (2003) reported that MDC1 contains a large S/TQ cluster
domain encompassing its N-terminal half. The central region of MDC1 has
a large proline/serine/threonine-rich repeat domain.

GENE FUNCTION

Goldberg et al. (2003) showed that, in response to ionizing radiation,
MDC1 was hyperphosphorylated in an ATM (607585)-dependent manner and
rapidly relocalized to nuclei foci containing the MRE11 complex,
phosphorylated histone H2AX (601772), and TP53BP1 (605230).
Downregulation of MDC1 expression by small interfering RNA yielded a
radioresistant DNA synthesis phenotype and prevented ionizing
radiation-induced focus formation by the MRE11 complex. However,
downregulation of MDC1 did not abolish the ionizing radiation-induced
phosphorylation of NBS1 (602667), CHK2 (604373), and SMC1 (300040), or
the degradation of CDC25A (116947). Furthermore, overexpression of the
MDC1 FHA domain interfered with focus formation by MDC1 itself and by
the MRE11 complex, and it induced a radioresistant DNA synthesis
phenotype. Goldberg et al. (2003) concluded that MDC1-mediated focus
formation by the MRE11 complex at sites of DNA damage is crucial for the
efficient activation of the intra-S-phase checkpoint.

Stewart et al. (2003) showed that MDC1 works with H2AX to promote
recruitment of repair proteins to the site of DNA breaks and controls
damage-induced cell-cycle arrest checkpoints. MDC1 formed foci that
colocalized extensively with gamma-H2AX foci within minutes after
exposure to ionizing radiation. H2AX was required for MDC1 foci
formation, and MDC1 formed complexes with phosphorylated H2AX. Peptides
containing the phosphorylated site on H2AX bound MDC1 in a
phosphorylation-dependent manner. Stewart et al. (2003) used small
interfering RNA to show that cells lacking MDC1 were sensitive to
ionizing radiation and that MDC1 controlled the formation of
damaged-induced TP53BP1, BRCA1 (113705), and MRN (MRE11, RAD50 (604040),
NBS1, i.e., the MRE11 complex) foci, in part by promoting efficient H2AX
phosphorylation. In addition, cells lacking MDC1 failed to activate the
intra-S phase and G2/M phase cell cycle checkpoints properly after
exposure to ionizing radiation, and this failure was associated with the
inability to regulate CHK1 (603078) properly.

Lou et al. (2003) found that MDC1 localized to sites of DNA breaks and
associated with CHK2 after DNA damage. This association was mediated by
the MDC1 FHA domain and the phosphorylated thr68 of CHK2. MDC1 was
phosphorylated in an ATM/CHK2-dependent manner after DNA damage,
suggesting that MDC1 may function in the ATM/CHK2 pathway. Consistent
with this hypothesis, suppression of MDC1 expression resulted in
defective S-phase checkpoint and reduced apoptosis in response to DNA
damage, which could be restored by expression of wildtype MDC1, but not
by MDC1 with a deleted FHA domain. Suppression of MDC1 expression
resulted in decreased p53 (191170) stabilization in response to DNA
damage. Lou et al. (2003) concluded that MDC1 is recruited through its
FHA domain to the activated CHK2 and has a critical role in
CHK2-mediated DNA damage responses.

Shang et al. (2003) showed that NFBD1 is a 250-kD nuclear protein
containing a forkhead-associated motif at its N terminus, 2 BRCT motifs
at its C terminus, and 13 internal repetitions of a 41-amino acid
sequence. Five minutes after gamma-irradiation, NFBD1 formed nuclear
foci that colocalized with the phosphorylated form of H2AX and CHK2, 2
phosphorylation events involved in early DNA damage response. NFBD1 foci
were also detected in response to camptothecin, etoposide, and
methylmethanesulfonate treatments. Deletion of the forkhead-associated
motif or the internal repeats of NFBD1 had no effect on DNA
damage-induced NFBD1 foci formation. Conversely, deletion of the BRCT
motifs abrogated damage-induced NFBD1 foci. Ectopic expression of the
BRCT motifs reduced damage-induced NFBD1 foci and compromised
phosphorylated CHK2- and phosphorylated H2AX-containing foci. Shang et
al. (2003) concluded that NFBD1, like BRCA1 and TP53BP1, participates in
the early response to DNA damage.

By examining immunoglobulin heavy chain (see 147100) class switch
recombination in mouse B-lymphocytes deficient in H2ax, Atm, 53bp1, or
Mdc1, Franco et al. (2006) determined that these factors promote end
joining and thereby prevent DNA double-strand breaks from progressing
into chromosomal breaks and translocations.

Dimitrova and de Lange (2006) found that MDC1 had a role in detection
and repair of human and mouse telomeres rendered dysfunctional through
inhibition of TRF2 (TERF2; 602027). MDC1 knockdown affected the
formation of telomere dysfunction-induced foci, diminishing accumulation
of phosphorylated ATM, TP53BP1, NBS1, and, to a lesser extent,
gamma-H2AX. In addition, inhibition of MDC1 itself or of its recruitment
to chromatin significantly decreased the rate of nonhomologous
end-joining of dysfunctional telomeres. MDC1 appeared to promote a step
in the nonhomologous end-joining pathway after removal of the 3-prime
telomeric overhang.

Kolas et al. (2007) determined that the ubiquitin ligase RNF8 (611685)
mediates ubiquitin conjugation and 53BP1 (605230) and BRCA1 (113705)
focal accumulation at sites of DNA lesions. Moreover, Kolas et al.
(2007) established that MDC1 recruits RNF8 through phosphodependent
interactions between the RNF8 forkhead-associated domain and motifs in
MDC1 that are phosphorylated by the DNA damage-activated protein kinase
ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM; 607585). They showed that depletion
of the E2 enzyme UBC13 (603679) impairs 53BP1 recruitment to sites of
damage, which suggests that it cooperates with RNF8. RNF8 was shown to
promote the G(2)/M DNA damage checkpoint and resistance to ionizing
radiation. Kolas et al. (2007) concluded that their results demonstrated
how the DNA damage response is orchestrated by ATM-dependent
phosphorylation of MDC1 and RNF8-mediated ubiquitination.

Pei et al. (2011) found that H4K20 methylation actually increases
locally upon the induction of double-strand breaks and that methylation
of H4K20 at double-strand breaks is mediated by the histone
methyltransferase MMSET (602952) in mammals. Downregulation of MMSET
significantly decreases H4K20 methylation at double-strand breaks and
the subsequent accumulation of 53BP1. Furthermore, Pei et al. (2011)
found that the recruitment of MMSET to double-strand breaks requires the
gamma-H2AX (601772)-MDC1 pathway; specifically, the interaction between
the MDC1 BRCT domain and phosphorylated ser102 of MMSET. Thus, Pei et
al. (2011) proposed that a pathway involving gamma-H2AX-MDC1-MMSET
regulates the induction of H4K20 methylation on histones around
double-strand breaks, which, in turn, facilitates 53BP1 recruitment.

MAPPING

By analysis of human/rodent hybrid cell lines, Nagase et al. (1996)
mapped the MDC1 gene to chromosome 6.

ANIMAL MODEL

Lou et al. (2006) found that Mdc1 -/- mice were born at the expected
mendelian frequency, but they showed a phenotype similar to that of H2ax
-/- mice, including growth retardation, male infertility, immune
defects, chromosome instability, DNA repair defects, and radiation
sensitivity. In the absence of Mdc1, many downstream Atm signaling
events were defective following DNA damage. Lou et al. (2006) concluded
that MDC1 is a signal amplifier of the ATM pathway that is vital in
controlling proper DNA damage response and maintaining genomic
stability.

604351	TITLE *604351 PHD FINGER PROTEIN 2; PHF2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PHD (plant homeodomain) finger genes are thought to belong to a diverse
group of transcriptional regulators affecting eukaryotic gene expression
by influencing chromatin structure (Hasenpusch-Theil et al., 1999). See
602881.

CLONING

By screening a size-fractionated human brain cDNA library for cDNAs
encoding proteins larger than 50 kD, Ishikawa et al. (1998) identified
PHF2, which they called KIAA0662. By in vitro transcription/translation,
they determined that the PHF2 gene encodes a protein of molecular mass
greater than 100 kD. RT-PCR showed expression of PHF2 in all tissues
examined.

Hasenpusch-Theil et al. (1999) isolated a cDNA encoding PHF2 from a
human cDNA library enriched for transcripts from chromosome 9q22. The
PHF2 cDNA encodes a putative 1,099-amino acid protein with a PHD finger
motif at the N terminus, 8 putative nuclear localization signals, and 2
PEST (proline-glutamic acid-serine-threonine) domains. Northern blot
analysis of adult human tissues detected a 5.5-kb transcript in all
tissues examined.

MAPPING

Hasenpusch-Theil et al. (1999) determined that the genetic marker D9S196
on chromosome 9q22 is located near or within the PHF2 gene. They
confirmed the mapping of the PHF2 gene to 9q22 by localizing this marker
by PCR to a cosmid used in the isolation procedure. Ishikawa et al.
(1998) mapped the PHF2 gene to chromosome 9 by analysis of a radiation
hybrid panel.

608525	TITLE *608525 INHIBITOR OF GROWTH 5; ING5
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for sequences similar to ING1 (601566) and ING2 (604215),
followed by PCR and RACE of a placenta cDNA library, Shiseki et al.
(2003) cloned ING5, which they called p28ING5. The deduced 240-amino
acid protein contains a C-terminal plant homeodomain finger motif and 2
nuclear localization signals.

GENE FUNCTION

Shiseki et al. (2003) showed that overexpression of ING4 (608524) or
ING5 in cancer cell lines diminished colony-forming efficiency,
decreased cell population in S phase, and induced p53 (191170)-dependent
apoptosis. Both ING4 and ING5 activated the WAF1 (116899) promoter and
induced WAF1 expression. ING4 and ING5 physically interacted with p300
(602700), a member of histone acetyltransferase complexes, and with p53
in vivo, and they enhanced acetylation of p53 at lys382.

By immunopurifying HeLa cell proteins that associated with ING5, Doyon
et al. (2006) found that ING5 was associated with 2 different histone
acetyltransferase complexes, one containing HBO1 (MYST2; 609880) and the
other containing MOZ (MYST3; 601408) and MORF (MYST4; 605880). In vitro
acetyltransferase assays indicated that the histone specificity of the 2
complexes differed, with the ING5-HBO1 complex targeting histone H4 (see
602822) and the ING5-MOZ-MORF complex targeting H3 (see 602810).
Knockdown of ING5 with small interfering RNA resulted in cells unable to
complete S phase. ING5-depleted HBO1 complexes were defective in their
ability to acetylate nucleosomal histones.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the ING5
gene to chromosome 2 (TMAP SHGC-64331).

608667	TITLE *608667 NIPPED-B-LIKE; NIPBL
;;NIPPED-B, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF;;
DELANGIN;;
SISTER CHROMATID COHESION 2, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; SCC2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Sister chromatids remain connected following duplication in S phase
until they segregate during anaphase of mitosis or meiosis II. This
cohesion counteracts the force of spindle microtubules on sister
kinetochores and allows chromosomes to align at the mitotic spindle.
Sister chromatid cohesion is also essential for segregation of
homologous chromosomes during meiosis I and for repair of DNA
double-strand breaks during G2 phase. Cohesin (see 606462) is a protein
complex required for sister chromatid cohesion. NIPBL forms a dimer with
MAU2 (614560) that is essential for loading the cohesin complex onto
sister chromatids (Watrin et al., 2006).

CLONING

In the course of searching for the molecular basis of the Cornelia de
Lange syndrome (CDLS; 122470), Tonkin et al. (2004) and Krantz et al.
(2004) analyzed de novo balanced translocations associated with Cornelia
de Lange syndrome and identified a novel gene at 5p13.1 that is
disrupted in these cases. Tonkin et al. (2004) designated the product of
the Nipped-B-like (NIPBL) gene 'delangin.' The coding sequence commences
in exon 2 and continues either to exon 47, generating a long isoform
(2,804 amino acids), or to an expanded variant of exon 46, generating a
slightly shorter isoform (2,697 amino acids). Residues 1 through 2,683
of the short and long isoforms are identical; the short isoform contains
a 14-amino acid C-terminal end that is unrelated to the 121-amino acid
C-terminal end of the long isoform (Tonkin et al., 2004). Northern blot
analysis showed that NIPBL is strongly expressed in fetal and adult
kidney, fetal liver, adult placenta, heart, skeletal muscle, and thymus,
but weakly or almost undetectably expressed in fetal and adult brain and
lung and in adult liver, colon, small intestine, and leukocytes (Tonkin
et al., 2004). Tonkin et al. (2004) found that vertebrate delangins have
substantial homology to orthologs in flies, worms, plants, and fungi,
including Scc2-type sister chromatid cohesion proteins, and D.
melanogaster Nipped-B.

Using bioinformatic analysis, Yan et al. (2006) showed that NIPBL
protein contains an N-terminal caldesmon (CALD1; 114213) domain, a
calponin (CNN1; 600806) domain, and 2 calmodulin (CALM1; 114180)-binding
motifs, followed by a nuclear localization signal, a nuclear export
signal, 5 HEAT repeats, and a C-terminal DNA-binding domain.

GENE FUNCTION

In situ hybridization to whole mouse embryos detected Nipbl transcripts
at gestation days 9.5 and 10.5, with notable accumulations in limb bud,
branchial arch, and craniofacial mesenchyme (Krantz et al., 2004). In
situ hybridization to human embryonic tissue sections revealed an
expression pattern largely consistent with the CDLS phenotype (Tonkin et
al., 2004). Krantz et al. (2004) found evidence for alternative splicing
of the NIPBL gene in the presence of multiple transcripts detected on
Northern blot analysis.

The evolution of an ancestral sister chromatid cohesion protein to
acquire an additional role in developmental gene regulation suggested to
Tonkin et al. (2004) that there are parallels between CDLS and Roberts
syndrome (268300), which is characterized by growth retardation, limb
reduction defects, craniofacial abnormalities, and premature centromere
separation. A dual role for Nipped-B in sister chromatid cohesion and
developmental regulation was confirmed by Rollins et al. (2004).

By metaphase spread analysis, Kaur et al. (2005) found evidence of
precocious sister chromatid separation (PSCS) in 37 (41%) of 90 probands
with CDLS compared to 8 (9%) of controls. Of the 37 CDLS patients with
PSCS, 16 (43%) had mutations in the NIPBL gene, whereas 21 (57%) did
not. Both severe and mild phenotypes were seen in those with PSCS and
those without PSCS. Kaur et al. (2005) noted that Roberts syndrome
(268300), which has phenotypic overlap with CDLS and is associated with
premature sister chromatid separation, is caused by mutations in the
ESCO2 gene (609353), which is required for proper establishment of the
sister chromatid cohesion complex.

Using immunoprecipitation analysis, Watrin et al. (2006) showed that
SCC4 (MAU2) interacted with SCC2 in HeLa cell nucleoplasmic extracts.
SCC4 and SCC2 cosedimented in fractionated HeLa cell extracts and
colocalized on chromatin in HeLa cells during interphase and telophase.
Depletion of either SCC4 or SCC2 via small interfering RNA delayed
mitotic exit and caused loss of cohesin from chromatin during interphase
and telophase, precocious loss of sister chromatid cohesion,
misalignment of chromosomes, appearance of single sister chromatids, and
prometaphase arrest. Knockdown of either SCC4 or SCC2 also reduced the
amount of the other protein, suggesting that physical association
between them is required for stability. Chromosomes in SCC4- or
SCC2-depleted cells lacked cohesin despite the presence of the cohesin
protectors SGO1 (SGOL1; 609168) and BUB1 (602452).

Independently, Seitan et al. (2006) showed that MAU2
coimmunoprecipitated with delangin. Drosophila and Xenopus orthologs of
MAU2 and delangin also interacted directly. Protein truncation and yeast
2-hybrid analyses revealed that the N termini of MAU2 and delangin
mediated their interaction. Knockdown of MAU2 in HeLa cells resulted in
increased frequency of precocious sister chromatid separation. In
control cells, release from block in G2/M resulted in rapid loading of
cohesin subunits onto chromatin. In MAU2 knockdown cells, cohesin
complexes formed, but they failed to load onto chromatin.

Kagey et al. (2010) reported that Mediator (see MED8, 607956) and
cohesin (see SMC1, 300040) physically and functionally connect the
enhancers and core promoters of active genes in murine embryonic stem
cells. Mediator, a transcriptional coactivator, forms a complex with
cohesin, which can form rings that connect 2 DNA segments. The
cohesin-loading factor NIPBL is associated with Mediator-cohesin
complexes, providing a means to load cohesin at promoters. DNA looping
is observed between the enhancers and promoters occupied by Mediator and
cohesin. Mediator and cohesin co-occupy different promoters in different
cells, thus generating cell type-specific DNA loops linked to the gene
expression program of each cell.

GENE STRUCTURE

The NIPBL gene contains 47 exons spanning 188 kb, with commencement of
the coding sequence in exon 2 (Krantz et al., 2004; Tonkin et al.,
2004).

MAPPING

Krantz et al. (2004) and Tonkin et al. (2004) identified the NIPBL gene
within chromosome 5p13.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Tonkin et al. (2004) studied CDLS cases without translocations and
identified 9 plausible point mutations, at least 5 of which arose de
novo. As they found NIPBL mutations in individuals with severe and mild
CDLS, phenotypic variation may be explained in part by allelic
heterogeneity. The spectrum and distribution of mutations implied that
pathogenesis arose from loss or altered function of a single NIPBL
allele. The mutation detection rate in the study of Tonkin et al. (2004)
was approximately 50%. Thus, locus heterogeneity as well as allelic
heterogeneity may be present, but limitations of the screening methods
were also cited as a plausible explanation for the comparatively low
mutation detection rate. On the other hand, considerable intrafamilial
variation in phenotype of CDLS, even between affected sibs
(Krajewska-Walasek et al., 1995), suggests that additional factors may
be important. Tonkin et al. (2004) proposed that perturbed delangin
function may inappropriately activate distal-less homeobox (DLX) genes,
thereby contributing to the proximodistal limb patterning defects in
CDLS.

Krantz et al. (2004) identified 6 point mutations in individuals with
CDLS (608667.0001-608667.0006). All were expected to result in a
truncated or, in the case of the met1-to-lys mutation (M1K;
608667.0001), an untranslated protein.

Gillis et al. (2004) described the spectrum and distribution of NIPBL
mutations in a large well-characterized cohort of individuals with CDLS.
In 56 (47%) of 120 unrelated individuals with sporadic or familial CDLS,
they identified mutations in the NIPBL gene (see
608667.0007-608667.0012). In 49 (46%) of the 106 individuals with
sporadic CDLS, 44 different mutations were identified, 14 (32%) of which
were small deletions. In 6 the 7 familial cases of CDLS in which NIPBL
mutations were identified, germline mosaicism was considered the likely
mechanism for the occurrence of affected sibs with mutation-negative
parents.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Gillis et al. (2004) found statistically significant phenotypic
differences between mutation-positive and mutation-negative individuals
with CDLS. Analysis also suggested a trend toward a milder phenotype in
individuals with missense mutations.

Yan et al. (2006) identified 13 different NIPBL mutations, including 11
novel mutations, in 13 (46%) of 28 Polish patients with a clinical
diagnosis of CDLS. Eleven of the mutations resulted in a premature
termination of the protein. Mutation-positive patients were more
severely affected than mutation-negative patients with respect to
prenatal growth, facial dysmorphism, and speech impairment.

CORNELIA DE LANGE SYNDROME 1
NIPBL, MET1LYS

In 3 sibs with CDLS (122470), each with a different father, Krantz et
al. (2004) identified a start codon mutation, 2G-A (M1K), in the NIPBL
gene. The mutation was not present in their mother or in the 2 fathers
from whom samples were available. All 3 sibs, ages 17, 8, and 3 years,
had moderate growth and cognitive delays, small hands without reduction
defects, hirsutism, and typical facial features. Germline mosaicism was
presumably the mechanism for the familial recurrence since the mother
had not manifested features of the disorder.

.0002
CORNELIA DE LANGE SYNDROME 1
NIPBL, TYR2430CYS

In an individual with classic features of CDLS (122470), Tonkin et al.
(2004) identified a 7289A-G transition in exon 43 of the NIPBL gene
resulting in a tyr2430-to-cys (Y2430C) amino acid change in the delangin
protein. The patient showed severe growth retardation, lobster limb
defect, characteristic face, feeding difficulties, and gastroesophageal
reflux.

.0003

NIPBL, 1-BP DEL, 150G

In a child with CDLS (122470), Krantz et al. (2004) identified a 1-bp
deletion, 150delG, in exon 3 of the NIPBL gene, resulting in frameshift
with a stop codon 28 amino acids downstream. The male child, seen at 4.5
months of age, had severe bilateral upper limb reduction defects
(oligodactyly, single digit), severe growth and cognitive delays,
typical facial features, hirsutism, and cleft palate.

(2004) found a de novo 1-bp insertion, 7306_7307insG, in exon 43 of the
NIPBL gene. The patient showed growth retardation, microbrachycephaly,
long philtrum, thin lips, crescent-shaped mouth, synophrys, bushy
eyebrows, general hirsutism, hearing impairment, myopia, micromelia,
clinodactyly, proximally placed thumbs, fixed flexion of the elbows,
syndactyly of the feet, bilateral inguinal hernias, and undescended
testes.

CORNELIA DE LANGE SYNDROME 1
NIPBL, 1-BP INS, 1546G

In an adult female with classic features of CDLS (122470), Krantz et al.
(2004) identified a 1-bp insertion, 1546_1547insG, in exon 10 of the
NIPBL gene. The insertion resulted in a frameshift with a stop codon 3
amino acids downstream. The patient showed severe growth and cognitive
delays, reduction defect of the right limb (oligodactyly, 4 digits) and
small left hand with no reduction defect, typical facial features,
hirsutism, cleft palate, and hearing loss.

In a patient with mild features of CDLS (122470), Tonkin et al. (2004)
described a 3-bp deletion of nucleotides 3616 through 3618 in exon 14 of
the NIPBL gene (ATA) resulting in deletion of isoleucine-1206. The
change was absent in maternal DNA; no paternal DNA was available. The
patient showed growth retardation, small hands, microcephaly, speech
delay, and inguinal hernia.

.0007
CORNELIA DE LANGE SYNDROME 1
NIPBL, 2-BP DEL, 2479AG

In 2 unrelated children with sporadic CDLS (122470), Gillis et al.
(2004) identified a 2-bp deletion in exon 10 of the NIPBL gene,
2479delAG, resulting in a frameshift and truncation of the protein 2
amino acids downstream. Both children were severely affected in terms of
growth and development; however, one had significant limb reduction
defects whereas the other did not.

NIPBL, ALA1246GLY

Krantz et al. (2001) described male first cousins from a family with
CDLS (122470), the sons of unaffected sisters, who were excluded from
linkage analysis because of the atypical inheritance pattern. In the 2
affected males, Gillis et al. (2004) identified different de novo
mutations in the NIPBL gene, neither of which was present in the
parents: in one, an ala1246-to-gly (A1246G) substitution in exon 15, and
in the other, a 7861G-C transversion at position -1 in the intron
upstream of exon 46 (608667.0010).

NIPBL, IVS44DS, A-G, +4

In affected members of a family with CDLS (122470) previously described
by Krantz et al. (2004), Gillis et al. (2004) identified a 7321A-G
transition at position +4 of exon 43 of the NIPBL gene. The mutation was

the NIPBL gene.

.0013
CORNELIA DE LANGE SYNDROME 1
NIPBL, 2-BP DEL/1-BP INS

Borck et al. (2006) screened 21 CDLS (122470) patients with no
previously identified NIPBL anomaly for mutations in the 5-prime
untranslated region and the proximal promoter of the NIPBL gene. They
identified a heterozygous deletion-insertion mutation in exon 1, 321
nucleotides upstream of the translation initiation codon
(-321_-320delCCinsA) in an affected girl and her mildly affected father.
The CC dinucleotide and the surrounding sequence are highly conserved in
mammalian NIPBL homologs. The deletion-insertion variant was not
identified in either parent of the father. The affected child was the
first offspring of parents who were related as second cousins
originating from Algeria. The diagnosis was made in the neonatal period
because of characteristic dysmorphic facial features. The father had had
feeding problems and gastroesophageal reflux in infancy, as did the
proband. He also had developmental delay and speech delay, with his
first words spoken at age 3 years, 6 months. At 7 years of age he was
operated on for subvalvular aortic stenosis. He had growth retardation
with a final height of 152 cm. The heights of his father and mother were
168 cm and 152 cm, respectively. Dysmorphic features in the father
included arched eyebrows with synophrys, long eyelashes, long nose, and
thin upper lip.

DESCRIPTION For background information on the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
and human leukocyte antigens (HLAs), see HLA-A (142800).

MAPPING

Cann et al. (1983) found a restriction fragment that segregated with
HLA-B8. Either the fragment carried the B8 specificity or represented
another class I gene (or pseudogene) in linkage disequilibrium with
HLA-B8.

Dunham et al. (1987) used pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and 'cosmid
walking' to establish a molecular map of the MHC region. They concluded
that the MHC spans 3,800 kb. The HLA-B locus lies about 250 kb on the
telomeric side of the tumor necrosis factor genes (see TNFA; 191160).

Spies et al. (1989) found that the HLA-B gene is 210 kb from the TNFA
and TNFB (153440) genes. The class III gene C2 is separated from the
HLA-B gene by 600 kb.

Spies et al. (1989) concluded that a 600-kb DNA segment between C2 and
HLA-B contains a minimum of 19 genes. In addition to BAT1 (142560)
through BAT5 (142620), which had been localized to the vicinity of the
TNFA and TNFB genes, 4 genes, called BAT6 through BAT9, were mapped near
C2 within a 120-kb region that also includes a pair of heat-shock
protein genes (see 140550). A large number of BssHII and SacII
restriction sites, known to indicate the presence of multiple islands of
CPG-rich sequences and in turn the association of expressed genes,
occurred within 140 kb of DNA upstream from C2. In contrast, no gene was
found within the 175-kb interval between BAT1 and HLA-B, which is
relatively devoid of CPG-rich sequences.

Bronson et al. (1991) isolated yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clones
carrying the HLA-B and HLA-C (142840) genes. The loci were found to be
located about 85 kb apart, each in close association with a CpG island.

GENE FUNCTION

Fleischhauer et al. (1990) demonstrated that a single amino acid
difference in the HLA-B molecule is sufficient for the development of
alloreactivity in vivo. They reported the case of a 29-year-old man with
chronic myelogenous leukemia who received a bone marrow transplant from
an unrelated female donor who was serologically HLA identical and
compatible in mixed lymphocyte culture. However, they differed with
respect to HLA-B44 subtypes B44.1 and B44.2, which were distinguishable
by their characteristic band patterns in isoelectric-focusing (IEF) gel
electrophoresis. The IEF difference, based on differences in charged
amino acids, was found to be due to leucine versus aspartic acid at
position 156.

Leinders-Zufall et al. (2004) showed that small peptides that serve as
ligands for MHC class I molecules function also as sensory stimuli for a
subset of vomeronasal sensory neurons located in the basal G-alpha-o-
(139311) and V2R receptor (see 605234)-expressing zone of the
vomeronasal epithelium. In behaving mice, the same peptides function as
individuality signals underlying mate recognition in the context of
pregnancy block. MHC peptides constitute a previously unknown family of
chemosensory stimuli by which MHC genotypic diversity can influence
social behavior.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Association With Protection From Severe Malaria

By means of a large case-controlled study of malaria (see 611162) in
West African children, Hill et al. (1991) showed that HLA-Bw53 and the
HLA class II haplotype, DRB1*1302/DQB1*0501, (see HLA-DRB1, 142857) are
independently associated with protection from severe malaria. The
antigens listed are common in West Africans but rare in other racial
groups. In this population, they account for as great a reduction in
disease incidence as the sickle-cell hemoglobin variant. Although the
relative strength of the protection is less than that of the sickle-cell
variant, the greater frequency of the DQB1 (see HLA-DQB1, 604305)
polymorphism makes the net effect on resistance to malaria comparable.
The findings support the hypothesis that the extraordinary polymorphism
of major histocompatibility complex genes has evolved primarily through
natural selection by infectious pathogens.

Hill et al. (1992) further investigated the protective association
between HLA-B53 and severe malaria by sequencing peptides eluted from
this molecule followed by screening of candidate epitopes from
pre-erythrocytic-stage antigens of Plasmodium falciparum in biochemical
and cellular assays. Among malaria-immune Africans, they found that
HLA-B53-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes recognized a conserved
nonamer peptide from liver-stage-specific antigen-1 (LSA-1), but no
HLA-B53-restricted epitopes were identified in other malaria antigens.
The findings of this 'reverse immunogenetic' approach indicated a
possible molecular basis for this HLA-disease association and supported
the candidacy of LSA-1 as a component for a malaria vaccine.

- Association With HIV-1 Disease Progression

Carrington et al. (1999) reported that the extended survival of 28 to
40% of HIV-1-infected Caucasian patients who avoided AIDS for 10 or more
years (see 609423) could be attributed to their being fully heterozygous
at HLA class I loci, to lacking the AIDS-associated alleles B*35 and
Cw*04, or to both.

Gao et al. (2001) examined subtypes of HLA-B*35 in 5 cohorts and
analyzed the relation of structural differences between subtypes to the
risk of progression to AIDS. Two subtypes were identified according to
peptide-binding specificity: the HLA-B*35-PY group, which consists
primarily of HLA-B*3501 and binds epitopes with proline in position 2
and tyrosine in position 9; and the more broadly reactive HLA-B*35-Px
group, which also binds epitopes with proline in position 2 but combines
several different amino acids (not including tyrosine) in position 9.
The influence of HLA-B*35 in accelerating progression to AIDS was
completely attributable to HLA-B*35-Px alleles, some of which differ
from HLA-B*35-Py alleles by only 1 amino acid residue. Gao et al. (2001)
concluded that the previously observed association of HLA-Cw*04 with
progression to AIDS was due to its linkage disequilibrium with
HLA-B*35-Px alleles. The fact that the association with B*35-Px was
observed in both blacks and whites supported the hypothesis that these
HLA-B alleles exert an effect on the immune response to HIV-1 infection.

Gao et al. (2005) found that HLA-B alleles acted during distinct
intervals after HIV infection. HLA-B35-Px and HLA-B57 were associated
with rate of progression to 4 outcomes: (1) progression to CD4+ T cells
less than 200 (CD4 less than 200), (2) CD4 less than 200 and/or an
AIDS-defining illness, (3) an AIDS-defining illness, and (4) death.
HLA-B27 (142830.0001), on the other hand, was only associated with the
last 3 outcomes. Protection mediated by HLA-B57 occurred early after
infection, whereas HLA-B27-mediated protection instead delayed
progression to an AIDS-defining illness after the decline in CD4 counts.
HLA-B35-Px showed an early susceptibility effect associated with rapid
progression from seroconversion to CD4 less than 200. Gao et al. (2005)
proposed that the presence of the various HLA-B alleles may lead to
different scenarios for viral escape from cytotoxic T-lymphocyte
pressure and virus subtypes with different fitnesses.

Martin et al. (2002) reported that the activating KIR allele KIR3DS1
(604946), in combination with HLA-B alleles that encode molecules with
isoleucine at position 80 (HLA-B Bw4-80Ile), is associated with delayed
progression to AIDS in individuals infected with HIV-1 (604946.0001). In
the absence of KIR3DS1, the HLA-B Bw4-80Ile allele was not associated
with any of the AIDS outcomes measured. By contrast, in the absence of
HLA-B Bw4-80Ile alleles, KIR3DS1 was significantly associated with more
rapid progression to AIDS. These observations strongly suggested a model
involving an epistatic interaction between the 2 loci. The strongest
synergistic effect of these loci was on progression to depletion of CD4+
T cells, which suggested that a protective response of NK cells
involving KIR3DS1 and its HLA class I ligands begins soon after HIV-1
infection.

Kiepiela et al. (2004) performed a comprehensive analysis of class I
restricted CD8+ T cell responses against HIV-1, immune control of which
depended upon virus-specific CD8+ T cell activity. In 375 HIV-1 infected
study subjects from southern Africa, a significantly greater number of
CD8+ T cell responses were HLA-B restricted compared to HLA-A (142800)
(2.5-fold; P = 0.0033). Kiepiela et al. (2004) showed that variation in
viral set point, in absolute CD4 count and, by inference, in rate of
disease progression in the cohort, was strongly associated with
particular HLA-B but not HLA-A allele expression (P less than 0.0001 and
P = 0.91, respectively). Moreover, substantially greater selection
pressure was imposed on HIV-1 by HLA-B alleles than by HLA-A (4.4-fold,
P = 0.0003). Kiepiela et al. (2004) concluded that their data indicated
that the principal focus of HIV-specific activity is at the HLA-B locus.
Furthermore, HLA-B gene frequencies in the population are those likely
to be most influenced by HIV disease, consistent with the observation
that B alleles evolve more rapidly than A alleles.

By testing the effects on HIV disease progression and viral load of
inhibitory KIR3DL1 subtypes in combination with HLA-B allelic groups,
Martin et al. (2007) determined that highly expressed, highly inhibitory
KIR3DL1*h alleles strongly enhance protection conferred by HLA-Bw4-80Ile
alleles, including HLA-B*57. Martin et al. (2007) proposed that greater
dependency on the expression of specific KIR3DL1-Bw4 receptor-ligand
pairs for NK cell inhibition in the resting state results in more
pronounced NK cell responses when the inhibition is abrogated in the
face of infection.

To define host genetic effects on the outcome of a chronic viral
infection, The International HIV Controllers Study (2010) performed
genomewide association analysis in a multiethnic cohort of HIV-1
controllers and progressors, and analyzed the effects of individual
amino acids within the classical human leukocyte antigen (HLA) proteins.
The International HIV Controllers Study (2010) identified more than 300
genomewide significant SNPs within the MHC and none elsewhere. Specific
amino acids in the HLA-B peptide binding groove, at positions 62, 63,
67, 70, and 97, as well as an independent HLA-C effect, explained the
SNP associations and reconciled both protective and risk HLA alleles.
The International HIV Controllers Study (2010) concluded that their
results implicated the nature of the HLA-viral peptide interaction as
the major factor modulating durable control of HIV infection.

- Association With Abacavir Hypersensitivity

Abacavir is a commonly used nucleoside analog with potent antiviral
activity against HIV-1. Approximately 5 to 9% of patients treated with
abacavir develop a hypersensitivity reaction characterized by
multisystem involvement that can be fatal in rare cases (Mallal et al.,
2002; Hetherington et al., 2002). Symptoms usually appear within the
first 6 weeks of treatment and include fever, rash, gastrointestinal
symptoms, and lethargy or malaise. Symptoms related to the
hypersensitivity reaction worsen with continued therapy and improve
within 72 hours of discontinuation of abacavir. Rechallenging with
abacavir after a hypersensitivity reaction typically results in
recurrence of symptoms within hours. Genetic predisposition for this
idiosyncratic hypersensitivity syndrome was suggested by its occurrence
in a small percentage of abacavir recipients during a short period of
drug exposure, and familial occurrence and decreased incidence in
individuals of African American origin (Symonds et al., 2002).
Consistent with these clinical observations, a strong predictive
association of HLA-B*5701 (142830.0003) was demonstrated, with further
evidence from recombinant haplotype mapping that the susceptibility
locus or loci reside specifically with the 57.1 ancestral haplotype,
identified by the haplospecific alleles HLA-B*5701 and C4A6 (see 120810)
and the HLA-DRB1*0701, HLA-DQ3 combination (Mallal et al., 2002). Martin
et al. (2004) reported that the combination of HLA-B*5701 and a
haplotypic M493T polymorphism of HSP70-HOM (140559) is highly predictive
of abacavir hypersensitivity.

- Association With Ankylosing Spondylitis

In a study of 15 multiplex families with ankylosing spondylitis
(106300), Rubin et al. (1992, 1994) found that 13 of 15 affected females
and 46 of 49 affected males were HLA-B27 (142830.0001) positive, as
compared with 22 of 43 unaffected females and 16 of 40 unaffected males.
The risk of ankylosing spondylitis for homozygotes was placed at 99.5%
and for heterozygotes at 43% with a sporadic risk of 0.1%. The B27
haplotype did not consistently segregate with disease in 2 families, but
both families still supported linkage to the major histocompatibility
complex. Identity-by-descent analyses showed a significant departure
from random segregation among affected avuncular (uncle/nephew-niece)
and cousin pairs. The presence of HLA-B40 in HLA-B27 positive
individuals increased the risk for disease more than 3-fold, confirming
previous reports. Disease susceptibility modeling suggested an autosomal
dominant pattern of inheritance with penetrance of approximately 20%. In
this study, which involved families from Toronto and Newfoundland, B27
alleles were detected by hybridization with sequence-specific
oligonucleotide probes after amplification of genomic DNA by PCR.

- Association With Age-Related Macular Degeneration

Goverdhan et al. (2005) investigated whether HLA genotypes were
associated with age-related macular degeneration (ARMD; see 603075).
They genotyped class I HLA-A, -B, and -Cw (see 142840) and class II DRB1
(142857) and DQB1 (604305) in 200 patients with ARMD, as well as in
controls. Allele Cw*0701 correlated positively with ARMD, whereas
alleles B*4001 and DRB1*1301 were negatively associated. These HLA
associations were independent of any linkage disequilibrium. Goverdhan
et al. (2005) concluded that HLA polymorphisms influenced the
development of ARMD and proposed modulation of choroidal immune function
as a possible mechanism for this effect.

- Association With Type I Diabetes

Nejentsev et al. (2007) used several large type I diabetes data sets to
analyze a combined total of 1,729 polymorphisms, and applied statistical
methods--recursive partitioning and regression--to pinpoint disease
susceptibility to the MHC class I genes HLA-B and HLA-A (142800) (risk
ratios greater than 1.5; P(combined) = 2.01 x 10(-19) and 2.35 x
10(-13), respectively) in addition to the established associations of
the MHC class II genes HLA-DQB1 (604305) and HLA-DRB1 (142857).
Nejentsev et al. (2007) suggested that other loci with smaller and/or
rarer effects might also be involved, but to find these future searches
must take into account both the HLA class II and class I genes and use
even larger samples. Taken together with previous studies, Nejentsev et
al. (2007) concluded that MHC class I-mediated events, principally
involving HLA-B*39, contribute to the etiology of type I diabetes.

- Association With Chronic Synovitis

Chronic synovitis occurs in about 10% of Indian patients with severe
hemophilia (HEMA, 306700; HEMB, 306900). Ghosh et al. (2003) reported an
association between the development of chronic synovitis in patients
with hemophilia and the HLA-B27 allele (142830.0001). Twenty-one (64%)
of 33 patients with both disorders had HLA-B27, compared to 23 (5%) of
440 with severe hemophilia without synovitis (odds ratio of 31.6). There
were 3 sib pairs with hemophilia in whom only 1 sib had synovitis; all
the affected sibs had the HLA-B27 allele, whereas the unaffected sibs
did not. Chronic synovitis presented as swelling of the joint with heat
and redness and absence of response to treatment with factor
concentrate. Ghosh et al. (2003) suggested that patients with HLA-B27
may ot be able to easily downregulate inflammatory mediators after
bleeding in the joints, leading to chronic synovitis.

- Association With Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reaction

Chung et al. (2004) studied 44 patients with carbamazepine-induced
Stevens-Johnson syndrome (608579), including 5 with overlapping toxic
epidermal necrolysis, in whom the clinical morphology fulfilled
Roujeau's diagnostic criteria (Roujeau, 1994). Controls included 101
patients who had been treated with carbamazepine for at least 3 months
without adverse reaction and 93 normal individuals. All participants
were Han Chinese residing in Taiwan. One hundred percent of the patients
who developed Stevens-Johnson syndrome carried the HLA-B*1502 allele
(142830.0002), while only 3% of the carbamazepine-tolerant individuals
and 8.6% of the normal controls carried this allele. When the
carbamazepine-tolerant group was used as the control, the presence of
HLA-B*1502 had a 93.6% positive predictive value for developing
carbamazepine-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome, whereas its absence had
a negative prediction value of 100%.

To identify genetic markers for allopurinol-induced severe cutaneous
adverse reaction (SCAR; 608579), Hung et al. (2005) genotyped 51
patients with allopurinol-SCAR and 228 controls (135
allopurinol-tolerant patients and 93 healthy individuals) for 823 SNPs
in genes related to drug metabolism and immune response. All
participants were unrelated Han Chinese residing in Taiwan. The
HLA-B*5801 allele (142830.0004) was present in all 51 of the patients
with allopurinol-SCAR, but in only 15% of allopurinol-tolerant controls
and 20% of healthy controls (p = 4.7 x 10(-24) and p = 8.1 x 10(-18),
respectively). Hung et al. (2005) concluded that the HLA-B*5801 allele
is an important genetic risk factor for severe cutaneous adverse
reactions to allopurinol in the Han Chinese population.

- Association With Drug-Induced Liver Injury Due To Flucloxacillin

In a genomewide association study of 51 patients with
flucloxacillin-induced liver injury and 282 controls, Daly et al. (2009)
found an association with dbSNP rs2395029 in the HCP5 gene (604676) in
the MHC region (p = 8.7 x 10(-33)). The SNP is in complete linkage
disequilibrium with HLA-B*5701 (142830.0003). Further MHC genotyping of
64 flucloxacillin-tolerant controls confirmed the association with
HLA-B*5701 (odds ratio of 80.6; p = 9.0 x 10(-19)). The association was
replicated in a second cohort of 23 patients. In HLA-B*5701 carriers,
dbSNP rs10937275 in the ST6GAL1 (109675) gene on chromosome 3q also
showed genomewide significance (odds ratio of 4.1; p = 1.4 x 10(-8)).

- Association With Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension
Without Deep Vein Thrombosis

For a discussion of a possible association between variation in the
HLA-B gene and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH)
without deep vein thrombosis, see 612862.

- Reviews

Cooke and Hill (2001) reviewed the genetics of susceptibility to human
infectious disease. Association with class I HLA alleles and infectious
disease have been demonstrated mainly with HLA-B: B8 with susceptibility
to pulmonary tuberculosis, B35 with susceptibility to AIDS, B53 with
resistance to severe malaria, and B57 with resistance to AIDS (see Table
3 of Cooke and Hill, 2001).

EVOLUTION

All Amerindian groups show limited HLA polymorphism which probably
reflects the small founder populations that colonized America by
overland migration from Asia 11,000 to 40,000 years ago. Belich et al.
(1992) found that the nucleotide sequences of HLA-B alleles from 2
culturally and linguistically distinct tribes of Southern Brazil are
distinct from those in Caucasian, Oriental, and other populations. By
comparison, the HLA-A (142800) and HLA-C alleles are similar. These
results and those reported by Watkins et al. (1992) from studies of a
tribe in Ecuador showed that a marked evolution of HLA-B occurred after
humans first entered South America. New alleles were formed through
recombination between preexisting alleles, not by point mutation, giving
rise to distinctive diversification of HLA-B in different South American
Indian tribes. Segmental exchanges of this type, even if they occur at a
lower frequency than point mutations, could be useful in the development
of resistance to infectious disease, for example, inasmuch as the
probability of an adaptively useful variant is much higher when there is
segmental exchange of already structurally valid coding sequence rather
than random point mutation.

Although most of the human MHC loci are relatively stable, the HLA-B
locus appears to be capable of rapid changes, especially in isolated
populations. To investigate the mechanisms of HLA-B evolution, McAdam et
al. (1994) compared the sequences of 19 HLA-B homologs from chimpanzees
(Pan troglodytes) and bonobos (Pan paniscus) to 65 HLA-B sequences.
Despite obvious similarities between chimpanzee and human alleles in
exon 2, there was little conservation of exon 3 between human and the 2
chimpanzee species. This finding suggested to McAdam et al. (1994) that,
unlike all other HLA loci, recombination has characterized the HLA-B
locus and its homologs for over 5 million years.

By genotyping individuals from 30 distinct populations, Single et al.
(2007) detected strong negative correlations between the presence of
activating KIR genes and their corresponding HLA ligand groups across
populations, particularly for KIR3DS1 (604946) and its putative HLA-B
Bw4-80Ile ligands. Weak positive relationships, on the other hand, were
found between inhibitory KIR genes and their HLA ligands. A negative
correlation was observed between distance from East Africa and the
frequency of activating KIR genes and their corresponding ligands.
Single et al. (2007) concluded that activating, rather than inhibitory,
receptor-ligand pairs show the strongest signature of coevolution
between the complex KIR and HLA genetic systems.

In a study of 15 multiplex families with ankylosing spondylitis

Chronic synovitis occurs in about 10% of Indian patients with severe
hemophilia (HEMA, 306700; HEMB, 306900). Ghosh et al. (2003) reported an
association between the development of chronic synovitis in patients
with hemophilia and the HLA-B27 allele. Twenty-one (64%) of 33 patients
with both disorders had HLA-B27, compared to 23 (5%) of 440 with severe
hemophilia without synovitis (odds ratio of 31.6). There were 3 sib
pairs with hemophilia in whom only 1 sib had synovitis; all the affected
sibs had the HLA-B27 allele, whereas the unaffected sibs did not.
Chronic synovitis presented as swelling of the joint with heat and

Ghosh et al. (2003) suggested that patients with HLA-B27 may ot be able
to easily downregulate inflammatory mediators after bleeding in the
joints, leading to chronic synovitis.

HLA-B, HLA-B*1502

Chung et al. (2004) studied 44 patients with carbamazepine-induced
Stevens-Johnson syndrome (608579), including 5 with overlapping toxic
epidermal necrolysis, in whom the clinical morphology fulfilled
Roujeau's diagnostic criteria (Roujeau, 1994). Controls included 101
patients who had been treated with carbamazepine for at least 3 months
without adverse reaction and 93 normal individuals. All participants
were Han Chinese residing in Taiwan. One hundred percent of the patients
who developed Stevens-Johnson syndrome carried the HLA-B*1502 allele,
while only 3% of the carbamazepine-tolerant individuals and 8.6% of the
normal controls carried this allele. When the carbamazepine-tolerant
group was used as the control, the presence of HLA-B*1502 had a 93.6%
positive predictive value for developing carbamazepine-induced
Stevens-Johnson syndrome, whereas its absence had a negative prediction
value of 100%.

In an expanded study of 60 Chinese patients with carbamazepine-induced
Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis, including the 44
patients reported by Chung et al. (2004), Hung et al. (2006) confirmed
the association between drug reaction and the HLA-B*1502 allele (p = 1.6
x 10(-41), odds ratio of 1,357). Fifty-nine of the 60 patients had the
susceptibility allele compared to 6 (4.2%) of 144 tolerant controls.
There was no association between HLA-B*1502 and 31 patients with
nonbullous adverse drug reactions, suggesting that HLA-B*1502 is
specific for bullous phenotypes.

Chen et al. (2011) recruited 4,877 candidate subjects from 23 hospitals
in Taiwan who had not taken carbamazepine. All were genotyped to
determine whether they carried the HLA-B*1502 allele. Those testing
positive (7.7% of the total) were advised not to take carbamazepine.
None of the 92.3% who were advised to take carbamazepine developed
Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis. The estimated
historical incidence of carbamazepine-induced SJS-TEN (0.23%) would
translate into approximately 10 cases among study subjects (P less than
0.001).

ABACAVIR HYPERSENSITIVITY, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
DRUG-INDUCED LIVER INJURY DUE TO FLUCLOXACILLIN, INCLUDED
HLA-B, HLA-B*5701

Abacavir is an HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitor used in combination
with other antivirals in the treatment of HIV infection. Its efficacy is
equivalent to other HIV drugs, such as HIV protease inhibitors, and
different combinations of drugs are used in clinical practice depending
on patient response, side effects, and drug resistance profiles.
Hypersensitivity reactions occur in approximately 5% of abacavir
patients and are characterized by symptoms such as fever, rash, and
acute respiratory symptoms, and can lead to potentially life-threatening
hypotension if drug therapy is not discontinued (Clay, 2002). Veenstra
(2004) noted that 2 studies had shown that patients with the HLA-B*5701
genotype are at greater risk of a hypersensitivity reaction, with an
odds ratio of 117 (95% CI = 29-481) in 1 study (Mallal et al., 2002) and
23.6 (95% CI = 8-70) in another (Hetherington et al., 2002). Hughes et
al. (2004) presented a cost-effectiveness analysis of HLA-B*5701
genotyping in preventing abacavir hypersensitivity.

Martin et al. (2004) reported that the combination of HLA-B*5701 and a
haplotypic M493T polymorphism of HSP70-HOM (140559) is highly predictive
of abacavir hypersensitivity.

Mallal et al. (2008) found that HLA-B*5701 screening reduced the risk of
hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir used in the treatment of HIV
infection.

In a genomewide association study of 51 patients with
flucloxacillin-induced liver injury and 282 controls, Daly et al. (2009)
found an association with dbSNP rs2395029 in the MHC region (p = 8.7 x
10(-33)). The SNP is in complete linkage disequilibrium with HLA-B*5701.
Further MHC genotyping of 64 flucloxacillin-tolerant controls confirmed
the association with HLA-B*5701 (odds ratio of 80.6; p = 9.0 x 10(-19)).
The association was replicated in a second cohort of 23 patients. In
HLA-B*5701 carriers, dbSNP rs10937275 in the ST6GAL1 (109675) gene on
chromosome 3q also showed genomewide significance (odds ratio of 4.1; p
= 1.4 x 10(-8)).

To identify genetic markers for allopurinol-induced severe cutaneous
adverse reaction (SCAR; 608579), Hung et al. (2005) genotyped 51
patients with allopurinol-SCAR and 228 controls (135
allopurinol-tolerant patients and 93 healthy individuals) for 823 SNPs
in genes related to drug metabolism and immune response. All
participants were unrelated Han Chinese residing in Taiwan. The
HLA-B*5801 allele was present in all 51 of the patients with
allopurinol-SCAR, but in only 15% of allopurinol-tolerant controls and
20% of healthy controls (p = 4.7 x 10(-24) and p = 8.1 x 10(-18),
respectively). Hung et al. (2005) concluded that the HLA-B*5801 allele
is an important genetic risk factor for severe cutaneous adverse
reactions to allopurinol in the Han Chinese population.

610523	TITLE *610523 CENTROSOMAL PROTEIN, 41-KD; CEP41
;;TESTIS-SPECIFIC PROTEIN A14 TESTIS-SPECIFIC PROTEIN 14, FORMERLY;
TSGA14, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using genomic sequence analysis of a PAC/BAC contig containing the
imprinted MEST (601029) gene, followed by EST database searching, Yamada
et al. (2002) identified cDNAs corresponding to 2 splice variants of
TSGA14 encoding deduced proteins of 373 and 54 amino acids. Northern
blot analysis detected transcripts of the longer isoform in adult testis
(1.4 and 3.7 kb) and in fetal brain, lung, liver, and kidney (3.7 and
2.9 kb). A 1.1-kb transcript of the shorter isoform was weakly expressed
in adult testis and fetal tissues. Using methylation analysis of a CpG
island in TSGA14 intron 1 and analysis of biallelic expression of an
exon 1 SNP in fetal tissues and blood lymphocytes, Yamada et al. (2002)
showed that TSGA14 escapes genomic imprinting. Yamada et al. (2002)
suggested that the 7q32 imprinted region may be small compared to other
imprinted domains.

In zebrafish, Lee et al. (2012) found Cep41 expression in various
ciliary organs, including Kupffer vesicle, ear, heart, brain, and
kidney. Cep41 was also found in the centrioles and cilia of several
ciliated cell lines, including mouse inner medullary collecting duct
cells and human retinal pigment epithelial cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yamada et al. (2002) determined that the TSGA14 gene contains 11 exons
and spans approximately 50 kb. The short variant is encoded by 3 exons,
the first 2 exons in common with the long variant and a third exon
located in intron 2 of the long variant.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Yamada et al. (2002) mapped the TGSA14
gene to chromosome 7q32 at a position 50 kb proximal to the MEST gene in
a head to head orientation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 3 consanguineous families with Joubert
syndrome-15 (JBTS15; 614464), 2 of Egyptian origin and 1 Portuguese, Lee
et al. (2012) identified 3 different homozygous mutations in the CEP41
gene (610523.0001-610523.0003). The first mutation was found by linkage
analysis followed by candidate gene sequencing in 1 of the families.
Heterozygous CEP41 mutations (see, e.g., 610523.0004-610523.0007) were
found in 5 additional patients with Joubert syndrome, and 3 of them were
found to carry heterozygous mutations in other genes associated with
ciliopathies (KIF7; 611254.0007 and CC2D2A; 612013.0007 and
612013.0009). These findings indicated digenic inheritance, and
suggested that CEP41 may act as a modifier in the broader class of
ciliopathies. Primary cultured fibroblasts from patients showed lack of
CEP41 protein. Induction of ciliogenesis in these fibroblast resulted in
cilia with a reduction of staining for GT335, which recognizes the
glutamylated forms of tubulin. Forced expression of CEP41 increased the
percentage of cells with glutamylated cilia. These findings suggested a
potential role of CEP41 in regulating the posttranslational modification
of tubulin by glutamylation. The cilia of zebrafish deficient in Cep41
showed a defect in tubulin structural defects, as well as defects in
motility. Only the axoneme appeared to be affected, with the centriole
being properly modified. Further studies in zebrafish and mouse cells
indicated that Cep41 functions by mediating transport of TTLL6 (610849),
an evolutionarily conserved polyglutamylase enzyme, between the basal
body and cilium. The findings implicated tubulin posttranslational
modification in the pathogenesis of human ciliary dysfunction.

ANIMAL MODEL

Lee et al. (2012) demonstrated that morpholino knockout of Cep41 in
zebrafish resulted in peripheral heart edema and tail defects, along
with ciliopathy-related phenotypes, including hydrocephalus, abnormal
ear otolith formation, and small eyes. Transfection of human CEP41
resulted in partial rescue of the phenotype. Specific knockout of Cep41
in zebrafish myocardium resulted in inversion defects or failure to
develop asymmetry of the ventricle and atrium, suggesting a role in
heart laterality. Homozygous Cep41 mouse mutants showed a wide range of
phenotypes, including malformed hindbrain, exencephaly, brain
hemorrhage, dilated pericardial sac, and lethality. However, some
homozygous mutants showed normal development, suggesting the presence of
extragenic phenotypic modifiers. The cilia of zebrafish deficient in
Cep41 showed a defect in tubulin glutamylation, and electron microscopy
showed structural defects in zebrafish renal cilia, with the A-tubules
of the outer doublet microtubules of the axoneme being collapsed and/or
duplicated. The cilia of the Kupffer vesicle and kidney showed disabled
motility. The data suggested that Cep41 is involved in ciliary
structural formation and motility by having an essential role in tubulin
glutamylation at the cilium.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
JOUBERT SYNDROME 15
CEP41, IVS1DS, T-G, +2

In 5 affected members of a consanguineous Egyptian family with Joubert
syndrome-15 (JBTS15; 614464), Lee et al. (2012) identified a homozygous
T-to-G transversion in intron 1 of the CEP41 gene (33+2T-G). Studies of
patient cells showed absence of mature CEP41 mRNA, probably a result of
nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The mutation was found by linkage analysis
followed by candidate gene sequencing. The patients had hypotonia,
ataxia, psychomotor delay with borderline or mild mental retardation,
and the molar tooth sign on brain imaging. One of the patients had a
more severe phenotype, with unilateral retinopathy, coloboma,
nephronophthisis, mild liver abnormalities, postaxial polydactyly, and
ambiguous genitalia, and died at age 7 days. The other 4 patients did
not have liver or renal involvement.

JOUBERT SYNDROME 15
CEP41, 3-BP DEL, IVS1DS, 97GAG

In 2 sisters, born of consanguineous Egyptian parents, with JBTS15
(614464), Lee et al. (2012) identified a homozygous 3-bp deletion
(97+3_5delGAG) predicted to abolish the donor splice site from exon 2.
The mutation was demonstrated to cause skipping of exon 2 and premature
truncation of the protein in exon 3. The girls had hypotonia, ataxia,
mental retardation, oculomotor apraxia, breathing abnormalities, and
molar tooth sign on brain imaging, but no renal or liver involvement.
One had unilateral postaxial polydactyly. A third sib, a boy, who did
not have the molar tooth sign, was found to be heterozygous for the
mutation.

CEP41, IVS6AS, A-C, -2

In a patient, born of consanguineous Portuguese parents, with JBTS15
(614464), Lee et al. (2012) identified a homozygous A-to-C transversion
(423-2A-C), predicted to abolish the splice acceptor site from exon 7.
The patient had hypotonia, ataxia, mental retardation, retinopathy,
polydactyly, and the molar tooth sign on brain imaging. He did not have
renal or hepatic involvement. He was also found to carry a heterozygous
mutation in the CEP290 gene (610142).

CEP41 gene, resulting in an arg179-to-his (R179H) substitution in a
highly conserved residue consistent with JBTS15 (614464), and a
heterozygous truncating mutation in the KIF7 gene (811delG;
611254.0007), consistent with JBTS12 (see 200990). He had hypotonia,
ataxia, mental retardation, oculomotor apraxia, breathing abnormalities,
and the molar tooth sign on brain imaging, but no liver, renal, or
retinal involvement.

In a Spanish patient with digenic inheritance of Joubert syndrome, Lee
et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous 107T-C transition in exon 3 of
the CEP41 gene, resulting in a met36-to-thr (M36T) substitution in a
highly conserved residue consistent with JBTS15 (614464), and a
heterozygous mutation in the CC2D2A gene (R1049X; 612013.0007),
consistent with JBTS9 (612285). She had hypotonia, ataxia, mental
retardation, and the molar tooth sign on brain MRI, but no liver, renal,
or retinal involvement.

.0006
JOUBERT SYNDROME 9/15, DIGENIC
CEP41, ARG360CYS

In a Swiss patient with digenic inheritance of Joubert syndrome, Lee et
al. (2012) identified a heterozygous 1078C-T transition in exon 11 of
the CEP41 gene resulting in an arg360-to-cys (R360C) substitution in a
conserved residue consistent with JBTS15 (614464), and a heterozygous
mutation in the CC2D2A gene (E1447A; 612013.0009), predicted to be a
potentially deleterious sequence variant and consistent with JBTS9
(612285). She had hypotonia, ataxia, mental retardation, oculomotor
apraxia, bilateral preaxial polydactyly, and the molar tooth sign on
brain MRI, but no liver, renal, or retinal involvement.

CEP41, SER28TER

In an Italian patient with JBTS15 (614464), Lee et al. (2012) identified
a heterozygous 83C-A transversion in exon 2 of the CEP41 gene, resulting
in a ser28-to-ter (S28X) substitution. A second pathogenic mutation was
not identified. The patient had hypotonia, ataxia, mental retardation,
oculomotor apraxia, breathing difficulties, and the molar tooth sign on
brain MRI, but no liver, renal, or retinal involvement.

604472	TITLE *604472 TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR LIGAND SUPERFAMILY, MEMBER 13; TNFSF13
;;APRIL;;
TNF- AND APOL-RELATED LEUKOCYTE EXPRESSED LIGAND 2; TALL2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family of ligands play
important roles in various physiologic and pathologic processes,
including cell proliferation, differentiation, and death, and modulation
of immune responses. By screening EST databases, Hahne et al. (1998)
cloned a novel TNF cDNA, TNFSF13, which they called APRIL, for 'a
proliferation-inducing ligand.' The full-length cDNA TNFSF13 clone
encodes a 250-amino acid protein with a predicted 28-amino acid
cytoplasmic domain, a hydrophobic transmembrane region, and an
extracellular domain of 201 amino acids with no signal peptide. There is
only 1 N-linked glycosylation site. The sequence of the extracellular
domain shows 21% homology with TNFSF6 (134638) and 20% homology with
TNFA (191160). Northern blot analysis revealed weak expression
restricted to a few tissues: transcripts of 2.1 and 2.4 kb in prostate
and a transcript of 1.8 kb in peripheral blood leukocytes. All tumor
cell lines, however, strongly expressed the TNFSF13 2.1-kb transcript,
and expression of extracellular or full-length TNFSF13 led to increased
proliferation of various cell lines.

Shu et al. (1999) identified the same gene, which they designated TALL2.
TALL2 shares about 35% sequence identity with TALL1 (BLYS, or TNFSF13B;
603969) in the C terminus.

By RACE, RT-PCR, and screening of a T-cell cDNA library, Pradet-Balade
et al. (2002) isolated a hybrid transcript formed by intergenic splicing
of exons 1 through 6 of TWEAK (TNFSF12; 602695) to exons 2 through 6 of
APRIL. See 602695 for further information on the protein encoded by the
TWEAK/APRIL transcript, which Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) called
TWEPRIL.

Using Northern blot analysis, Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) found that
relative expression of the 1.9-kb APRIL transcript was about 6-fold
higher than that of the 2.5-kb TWEPRIL transcript in resting T cells.
However, in activated T cells, both transcripts were expressed at
similar levels. A similar expression pattern for APRIL and TWEPRIL was
detected in CD4 (186940)-positive and CD8 (see 186910)-positive T-cell
subpopulations. TWEAK expression was similar between resting and
activated T cells. TWEAK was found predominantly in ribosome-free
fractions in both resting and activated T cells, whereas APRIL and
TWEPRIL increased their association with polyribosomes following T-cell
activation, suggesting that translational efficiency of APRIL and
TWEPRIL increases upon T-cell activation.

GENE FUNCTION

Seyler et al. (2005) analyzed synovial tissue specimens from 72 patients
with rheumatoid arthritis (180300) for TNFSF13 and TNFSF13B production
and TNFSF13/TNFSF13B receptor expression. Synovitis with ectopic
germinal centers present had the highest levels of TNFSF13, produced
exclusively by CD83 (604534)-positive dendritic cells; TNFSF13B was
present in similar levels in all types of synovitis (with or without
germinal centers or T cell-B cell aggregates) and was produced
exclusively from CD68 (153634)-positive macrophages. In synovitis with
germinal centers, inhibiting TNFSF13 and TNFSF13B with a TACI
(TNFRSF13B; 604907):Fc fusion protein resulted in destruction of the
germinal centers and marked inhibition of IFN-gamma (147570) and Ig
transcription, whereas similar inhibition in the aggregate and diffuse
types of synovitis enhanced IFN-gamma production and did not affect Ig
levels. These differential immunomodulatory effects correlated with the
presence of TACI-positive T cells in aggregate and diffuse synovitis and
their absence in synovitis with germinal centers. Seyler et al. (2005)
proposed that TNFSF13 and TNFSF13B regulate B-cell as well as T-cell
function and have both pro- and antiinflammatory effects in rheumatoid
arthritis.

Both BLYS and APRIL have been described as homotrimeric molecules, a
feature common to many members of the TNF superfamily. Using ELISA
analysis, Roschke et al. (2002) found that patients with systemic lupus
erythematosus (152700), rheumatoid arthritis, Reiter syndrome, psoriatic
arthritis (see 607507), polymyositis (see 160750), and ankylosing
spondylitis (106300) had significantly higher levels of BLYS/APRIL
heterotrimers than did controls. Roschke et al. (2002) proposed that
BLYS/APRIL heterotrimers may play a role in rheumatic and other
autoimmune diseases, and that other members of the TNF ligand
superfamily may also form active soluble heterotrimers.

Using cell-based, biochemical, and structural studies, Hymowitz et al.
(2005) characterized interactions between APRIL and TACI. They found
that the short isoform of human TACI, which lacks cysteine-rich domain-1
(CRD1), was still functional for signaling and that CRD2 of TACI was
sufficient for high-affinity binding to either murine April or human
BAFF (TNFSF13B). The solution structure of CRD2 of TACI revealed a
compact domain and additional ligand-binding determinants. Cocrystal
structures of murine April bound to CRD2 of human TACI or to human BCMA
(TNFRSF17; 109545) showed large interfaces and revealed key differences
that likely influence ligand-binding affinity and specificity.

Ingold et al. (2005) showed that the TNF homology domain of mouse and
human APRIL bound BCMA and TACI, whereas a basic sequence (QKQKKQ) close
to the N terminus of the mature protein bound negatively charged
sulfated glycosaminoglycan side chains of proteoglycans. Although T-cell
lines bound little APRIL, ectopic expression of glycosaminoglycan-rich
syndecans (see SDC1; 186355) or glypicans (see GPC1; 600395) conferred
on these cells a high binding capacity that was completely dependent on
the N-terminal basic sequence of APRIL. Moreover, SDC1-positive plasma
cells and proteoglycan-rich nonhematopoietic cells displayed high
specific, heparin-sensitive binding to APRIL. Inhibition of BAFF and
APRIL, but not BAFF alone, prevented survival and/or migration of newly
formed plasma cells to bone marrow. In addition, costimulation of B-cell
proliferation by APRIL was only effective upon APRIL oligomerization.
Ingold et al. (2005) proposed that APRIL binding to the extracellular
matrix or to proteoglycan-positive cells induces APRIL oligomerization,
which is the prerequisite for triggering TACI- and/or BCMA-mediated
activation, migration, and survival signals.

Using flow cytometry, fluorescence microscopy, and immunohistochemical
analysis, Huard et al. (2008) found that APRIL was expressed on
recruited neutrophils and accumulated on subepithelial heparan sulfate
proteoglycans in upper (e.g., tonsils) and lower (e.g., lamina propria)
mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) and contributed to survival of
plasma cells. Mice lacking April had less-persistent mucosal humoral
immunity. Huard et al. (2008) proposed that inflammation-recruited
neutrophils may create plasma cell niches in MALT to sustain local
antibody production.

GENE STRUCTURE

Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) determined that the TNFSF13 gene contains 6
exons.

MAPPING

Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) determined that the transcriptional start
site of the TNFSF13 gene lies 878 bp downstream of the TNFSF12 gene on
chromosome 17p13.1.

ANIMAL MODEL

By treating mice with TACI-Ig, Gross et al. (2001) determined that BLYS
and APRIL are required for the development of both transitional (T2) and
mature B lymphocytes. TACI-Ig-treated mice also had less circulating
immunoglobulin and produced less collagen-specific antibody. TACI-Ig
treatment inhibited the development of collagen-induced rheumatoid
arthritis. Gross et al. (2001) proposed that TACI-Ig may have a role in
both the prevention and treatment of autoimmune disease mediated by
pathogenic autoantibodies.

Stein et al. (2002) created mice expressing human APRIL as a transgene
in T cells. These mice appeared normal. Transgenic T cells showed
enhanced survival in vitro and enhanced survival of staphylococcal
enterotoxin B-reactive Cd4-positive T cells in vivo, and both of these
responses correlated with elevated Bcl2 levels. Analysis of humoral
responses to T cell-dependent antigens in the transgenic mice indicated
that APRIL affected IgM responses, but not IgG responses. In contrast, T
cell-independent type-2 (TI-2) humoral responses were enhanced in APRIL
transgenic mice. As TACI had been reported to be indispensable for TI-2
antibody formation, Stein et al. (2002) concluded that APRIL-TACI
interactions have a role in generating the TI-2 response and that APRIL
is involved in the induction and/or maintenance of T- and B-cell
responses.

To investigate the role of APRIL in immunity, Castigli et al. (2004)
generated April-deficient mice. April -/- mice had normal T and B
lymphocyte development, normal T and B cell proliferation in vitro, but
increased numbers of CD4+ effector/memory T cells and increased IgG
responses to T-dependent antigens. Serum IgA levels were significantly
decreased, and serum IgA antibody responses to mucosal immunization with
T-dependent antigens and to type 1 T-independent antigens were impaired
in April -/- mice. The results suggested that APRIL downregulates T
cell-dependent antibody responses and promotes IgA class switching.

607422	TITLE *607422 GLYCINE C-ACETYLTRANSFERASE; GCAT
;;2-@AMINO-3-KETOBUTYRATE COENZYME A LIGASE; KBL
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

GCAT (EC 2.3.1.29) is the second mitochondrial enzyme in a 2-step
reaction that converts L-threonine to glycine.

CLONING

Edgar and Polak (2000) identified an EST for GCAT, which they called
KBL, based on homology with the E. coli KBL gene. They determined the
complete cDNA sequence from overlapping clones obtained by 3-prime and
5-prime RACE of a lung cDNA library. The deduced 419-amino acid protein
has a predicted molecular mass of about 45 kD. Its N-terminal domain
contains a characteristic mitochondrial targeting sequence. The
21-residue prosequence is cleaved to produce a mature protein of about
43 kD. Edgar and Polak (2000) also cloned mouse Gcat from a lung cDNA
library. The deduced mouse protein contains 416 amino acids and shares
90% identity with the human protein. Northern blot analysis detected
highest expression of a 1.5-kb transcript in human heart, brain, liver,
and pancreas; expression in lung was weak.

GENE STRUCTURE

Edgar and Polak (2000) determined that the GCAT gene contains 9 exons
and spans 8.9 kb. The 5-prime flanking region contains a potential TATA
box and a CpG island that encompasses exon 1. GCAT also has an unusual
putative polyadenylation sequence.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Edgar and Polak (2000) mapped the GCAT
gene to chromosome 22q12-q13, between the H1F0 (142708) and GALR3
(603692) genes.

609742	TITLE *609742 INTERLEUKIN 4-INDUCED GENE 1; IL4I1
;;IL4-INDUCED GENE 1;;
FIG1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

IL4I1 is induced by treatment with IL4 (147780), a cytokine associated
with antibody responses and, when in excess, autoimmune responses. IL4I1
is most similar to L-amino acid oxidases (LAAOs) and contains several
residues important for substrate binding and catalysis (Chavan et al.,
2002).

CLONING

By low-stringency probing of human genomic DNA with mouse Fig1, followed
by EST database analysis, screening genomic DNA libraries, and RT-PCR
and RACE of IL4-induced human B-cell RNA, Chavan et al. (2002) cloned
human IL4I1, which they called FIG1. The predicted 567-amino acid
protein has a calculated molecular mass of 63 kD. It contains an
N-terminal signal peptide, a central region that shares homology with
nonmammalian LAAOs, and 3 conserved domains likely to be involved in FAD
binding. The C terminus of human IL4I1 is 63 residues shorter than that
of the mouse protein. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a
1.7-kb transcript primarily in immune tissues, with highest levels in
spleen and thymus, followed by placenta and lung. Expression of IL4I1
was induced by IL4 in human B cells.

Independently, Copie-Bergman et al. (2003) cloned and characterized
IL4I1. RT-PCR analysis indicated that IL4I1 was preferentially expressed
in primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphomas rather than nonmediastinal
diffuse large B-cell lymphomas.

Wiemann et al. (2005) identified an IL4I1 variant, IL4I1-2, containing
the first 2 exons of the upstream NUP62 gene (605815). They determined
that expression of IL4I1-2 is driven by the apparent promoter of NUP62
and is specific to non-B cells, such as testis Sertoli cells and brain
Purkinje cells. The IL4I1 and IL4I1-2 proteins differ only in the length
of the signal sequence, and the processed proteins are identical.

GENE FUNCTION

Mason et al. (2004) showed that IL4I1, like other LAAOs, has a
preference for aromatic amino acid substrates, particularly
phenylalanine. It could be inhibited by aromatic competitors, but not by
nonaromatic LAAO inhibitors. Confocal microscopy demonstrated
colocalization of IL4I1 with lysosomal dyes, confirming predictions
based on its higher enzymatic activity at acidic pH and its N-linked
glycosylation. Mason et al. (2004) proposed that IL4I1 may have an
important role in lysosomal antigen processing and presentation.

Using Western blot, enzymatic, and immunohistochemical analyses,
Boulland et al. (2007) identified IL4I1 as a secreted, N-glycosylated
enzyme located in germinal center macrophages and inflammatory myeloid
cells. Highest enzyme levels were found in dendritic cells. IL4I1
inhibited proliferation of CD4 (186940)-positive, CD8 (see
186910)-positive, and, in particular, memory T cells stimulated by CD3
(see 186740) in a manner dependent on its enzymatic activity and H2O2
production. Flow cytometric analysis showed that the IL4I1 inhibitory
effect was associated with transient downregulation of TCRZ (CD247;
186780) expression.

Santarlasci et al. (2012) noted that IL17A (603149)-producing T-helper
(Th17) cells have a critical pathogenic role in chronic inflammatory
disorders, but they are rarely found in inflammatory sites. Santarlasci
et al. (2012) found that, unlike Th1 cells, human CD161 (KLRB1;
602890)-positive Th17 precursor cells did not proliferate and produce
IL2 (147680) in response to anti-CD3/anti-CD28 (186760) stimulation.
Th17 cells also proliferated poorly in response to IL2, in part due to
lower expression of the transcription factors JUN (165160), FOS
(164810), and NFATC1 (600489) and reduced surface expression of CD3E
(186830) and CD3Z. Microarray and small interfering RNA analyses
revealed high expression of IL4I1 in Th17 precursor cells and showed
that IL4I1 upregulation was strictly dependent on RORC (602943), the
Th17 master regulatory gene. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that Th17
cells also exhibited high CD28 expression that was RORC dependent, and
stimulation of CD28 alone induced IL17 production and IL4I1 mRNA
upregulation. Th17 cells from synovial fluid of patients with juvenile
idiopathic arthritis (see 604302) also expressed higher levels of IL4I1
and CD28 than did Th1 cells. Santarlasci et al. (2012) concluded that
the rarity of human Th17 cells in inflamed tissues results from
RORC-dependent mechanisms that limit their expansion and, therefore,
reduce their potential to cause damage.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chavan et al. (2002) determined that the IL4I1 gene contains 8 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Chavan et al. (2002) mapped the IL4I1 gene
to chromosome 19q13.3-q13.4, between the FUT1 (211100) and KLK1 (147910)
genes. The 5-prime end of IL4I1 is adjacent to NUP62.

612935	TITLE *612935 MYOSIN PHOSPHATASE RHO-INTERACTING PROTEIN; MPRIP
;;MRIP;;
KIAA0864;;
p116 RHO-INTERACTING PROTEIN; p116RIP;;
RIP3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a mouse brain cDNA library to isolate RhoA
(165390)-binding proteins, Gebbink et al. (1997) cloned mouse Mprip,
which they called p116Rip. The deduced 1,024-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 116.4 kD. It has 2 proline-rich sequences
near the N-terminus that are predicted to bind SH3 domains, a central
pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, and a C-terminal coiled-coil region,
which overlaps with the RhoA-binding domain. Northern blot analysis
detected p116Rip in all mouse tissues examined.

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned MPRIP, which they designated
KIAA0864. The deduced protein contains 1,218 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected highest MPRIP expression in ovary, followed by heart, brain,
liver, kidney, lung, skeletal muscle, and testis with lower expression
in pancreas and spleen.

Using the myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphatase (MBS, or
PPP1R12A; 602021) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human aorta
cDNA library, Surks et al. (2003) cloned MPRIP, which they called MRIP.
The deduced 1,024-amino acid protein shares 90% identity with mouse and
rat p116Rip3. It has 2 PH domains flanking 2 polyproline motifs in the
N-terminal half, and 3 coiled-coil domains in the C-terminal half. It
also has sites for myristoylation and phosphorylation, and it has a
putative nuclear localization signal. Immunohistochemical analysis of
coronary artery smooth muscle cells showed that MRIP colocalized with
MBS and RhoA at actin stress fibers. MRIP did not show nuclear
localization. Western blot analysis detected endogenous MRIP at an
apparent molecular mass of 125 kD in human smooth muscle cell lines.

GENE FUNCTION

Gebbink et al. (1997) showed that mouse p116Rip interacted with both the
GDP- and GTP-bound forms of RhoA in a mouse neuroblastoma cell line.
Overexpression of p116Rip stimulated cell flattening and neurite
outgrowth in a way similar to dominant-negative RhoA. Cells that
overexpressed p116Rip failed to retract neurites in response to
lysophosphatidic acid. Gebbink et al. (1997) concluded that p116RIP
counters RhoA signaling in neurite outgrowth.

Mulder et al. (2003) found that, rather than directly binding to RhoA,
mouse p116Rip interacted with filamentous F-actin (see 102610) via its
N-terminal region. In mouse and monkey cell lines, p116Rip colocalized
with dynamic F-actin structures such as stress fibers, cortical
microfilaments, filopodia, and lamellipodia ruffles. p116Rip induced
F-actin bundling in vitro via its actin-binding domain. However,
overexpression of p116Rip or its N-terminal actin-binding domain in cell
culture disrupted the actin cytoskeleton and interfered with growth
factor-induced contractility and lamellipodia formation.

Using coimmunoprecipitation analysis, Surks et al. (2003) confirmed that
human MRIP interacted with MBS in vascular smooth muscle cells. Mutation
analysis showed that the second coiled-coil domain of MRIP interacted
with the leucine zipper domain of MBS. MRIP also bound both GDP- and
GTP-RhoA following expression in COS-1 cells, and MBS was not required
for this interaction. MRIP immunoprecipitation also led to recovery of
PP1 (PPA1; 179030) and cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PRKG1; 176894),
and interacted with these proteins indirectly via its interaction with
MBS.

Using gene silencing with human vascular smooth muscle cells, Surks et
al. (2005) showed that, via its interaction with MBS, MRIP targeted
myosin phosphatase to stress fibers to regulate the phosphorylation of
myosin light chain (see 160781). MRIP silencing resulted in marked
phenotypic changes in vascular smooth muscle cells, including increased
numbers of stress fibers, increased cell area, and reduced stress fiber
inhibition in response to a Rho-kinase inhibitor. Surks et al. (2005)
concluded that MRIP regulates the formation of stress fibers and
vascular smooth muscle cell shape via its interaction with myosin
phosphatase.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the MPRIP gene
to chromosome 17.
