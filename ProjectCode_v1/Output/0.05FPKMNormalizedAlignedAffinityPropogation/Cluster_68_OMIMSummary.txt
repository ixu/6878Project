VAULT RNA COMPONENT 1; VAULTRC1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Vaults are large cytoplasmic ribonucleoproteins of about 13 MD. They are
composed of a major vault protein, MVP (605088), 2 minor vault proteins,
TEP1 (601686) and PARP4 (607519), and a nontranslated RNA component,
VTRNA1-1 (Kickhoefer et al., 1999).

CLONING

By PCR of a human genomic DNA library, Kickhoefer et al. (1998) cloned
VTRNA1-1, which they called HVG1. The 96-base RNA contains an internal
RNA polymerase III (see 606007)-type promoter element and ends with a
typical polymerase III termination signal.

Kickhoefer et al. (2003) found that the mouse genome contains only 1
expressed vault RNA gene, which they called Mvr1. Northern blot analysis
detected a single Mvr1 transcript in all mouse tissues examined, with
highest expression in lung, heart, and spleen and lowest expression in
brain.

Nandy et al. (2009) described the structure of VTRNA1-1. The
99-nucleotide RNA forms an extended stem-loop structure with asymmetric
internal bulges. It contains characteristic internal polymerase III
A-box and B-box promoter elements and a downstream B2-box motif. Size
exclusion chromatography of fractionated HeLa cells, followed by
Northern and Western blot analyses, detected about 5% of the VTRNA1-1
and VTRNA1-2 content eluting with MVP, while 95% remained in the
supernatant.

GENE FUNCTION

Kickhoefer et al. (1998) found that HVG1, but not HVG2 (VTRNA1-2;
612696) or HVG3 (VTRNA1-3; 612696), associated with vaults in human cell
lines. However, only a proportion of HVG1 associated with vaults, and
HVG1 not associated with vaults remained in the soluble fraction.
Expression of MVP and HVG1 and assembly of vaults increased up to
15-fold in several drug-resistant cell lines compared with the parental
cell lines. Increased vault assembly was associated with a concomitant
shift of HVG1 from the soluble to the pellet fraction. Kickhoefer et al.
(1998) hypothesized that the absolute vault level in cell lines may
dictate the extent of drug resistance.

Using Northern blot analysis, Kickhoefer et al. (1999) found that the
vault RNAs HVG1 and HVG4 copurified with vaults from all human cell
types examined and interacted with mouse Tep1 in a yeast 3-hybrid
screen. However, Kickhoefer et al. (2003) reported that HVG4 is not
expressed.

Nandy et al. (2009) found that expression of VTRNA1-1, VTRNA1-2,
VTRNA1-3, and CBL3 (VTRNA2-1; 614938) was upregulated in cord blood
lymphocytes infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Upregulation was
highest for VTRNA1-1 (about 1,100-fold) and lowest for CBL3 (about
3-fold). Expression of VTRNA1-1, VTRNA1-2, and CBL3 was also upregulated
by the EBV-related Kaposi sarcoma virus, but not by members of other
virus families.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kickhoefer et al. (2003) determined that the upstream region of the
VTRNA1-1 gene contains a TATA-like element, a consensus proximal
sequence, and a cAMP response element.

MAPPING

Kickhoefer et al. (2003) stated that the VTRNA1-1, VTRNA1-2, and
VTRNA1-3 genes map to a 16-kb region of chromosome 5. A vault RNA
pseudogene, HVG4, maps to chromosome X. The only expressed mouse vault
RNA gene, Mvr1, maps to chromosome 18.

Nandy et al. (2009) stated that the VTRNA1-1 gene is located near the
PCDHA gene cluster (604966), which Wu and Maniatis (1999) mapped to
chromosome 5q31.

;;ASC1 COMPLEX, 50-KD SUBUNIT;;
p50
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing peptides that copurified with the 650-kD ASC1 (TRIP4;
604501) complex from HeLa cells, followed by database analysis and PCR
of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Jung et al. (2002) cloned ASCC1, which they
designated p50. The deduced 357-amino acid protein contains a KH-type
RNA-binding motif near its N terminus. Northern blot analysis detected
variable expression of an approximately 2.1-kb transcript in all tissues
examined. P50 localized to both nuclei and cytoplasm of HeLa cells.
Database analysis revealed orthologs of p50 in mouse, fly, frog, and
nematode.

GENE FUNCTION

Jung et al. (2002) identified a 650-kD protein complex containing ASC1,
p50, p100 (ASCC2; 614216), and p200 (ASCC3; 614217). Immunodepletion of
p50 from HeLa cell nuclear extracts almost completely eliminated phorbol
ester-induced AP1 (see 165160) transactivation of a reporter gene. Yeast
2-hybrid analysis, coimmunoprecipitation of in vitro-translated
proteins, and protein pull-down experiments confirmed direct interaction
between p50 and p200. Domain analysis revealed that the KH motif of p50
was required its interaction with p200.

Gastrin (GAS; 137250) regulates the expression of a variety of genes
involved in the control of acid secretion. It also triggers tissue
response to damage, infection, and inflammation in cells expressing
gastrin receptor (CCKBR; 118445) and, indirectly, in nearby cells via a
paracrine mechanism. Almeida-Vega et al. (2009) found that gastrin
directly induced upregulation of the antiapoptotic regulator PAI2
(SERPINB2; 173390) in CCKBR-positive cells. CCKBR-positive cells also
released IL8 (146930) and prostaglandin E2 into the culture medium in
response to gastrin, which resulted in elevated PAI2 expression in
cocultured CCKBR-negative cells. IL8 signaling in CCKBR-negative cells
upregulated PAI2 via binding of the ASC1 complex to the PAI2 promoter.
Prostaglandin E2 independently upregulated PAI2 via RHOA
(165390)-dependent signaling that induced binding of MAZ (600999) to the
PAI2 promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin
immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that MAZ and the p50 subunit of
the ASC1 complex bound directly to sites in the PAI2 promoter. Mutation
of the putative MAZ site in the PAI2 promoter reduced responses to RHOA.
Knockdown of the p50 or p65 (TRIP4) subunits of the ASC1 complex via
small interfering RNA significantly reduced PAI2 upregulation in
response to gastrin.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the ASCC1 gene to chromosome 10q22.1 based on an
alignment of the ASCC1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF132952) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Orloff et al. (2011) identified a germline asn290-to-ser (N290S;
614215.0001) mutation in the ASCC1 gene in 2 (2.1%) of 116 patients of
European descent with Barrett esophagus and/or esophageal adenocarcinoma
(614266). The mutation was not found in 125 controls. This genomic
region was studied after being identified by genomewide linkage analysis
of 21 concordant and 11 discordant sib pairs with the disorders.

604764	TITLE *604764 ZINC FINGER AND HOMEODOMAIN PROTEIN 1; ZHX1
DESCRIPTION NFYA (189903), NFYB (189904), and NFYC (605344) comprise the
heterotrimeric transcription factor known as nuclear factor Y (NF-Y), or
CCAAT-binding protein (CBF). NF-Y binds many CCAAT box elements and Y
box elements, which are inverted CCAAT boxes. Mutations of these
elements that disrupt the binding of NF-Y result in decreased
transcription from various tissue-specific and inducible promoters. To
identify proteins that interact with NF-Y and that may play a role in
tissue-specific or hormone-inducible promoter activity, Yamada et al.
(1999) screened a human liver cDNA library using a yeast 2-hybrid system
with the NFYA subunit as bait. They isolated a partial ZHX1 cDNA lacking
5-prime coding sequence. Yamada et al. (1999) subsequently cloned the
remaining ZHX1 coding sequence. The predicted 873-amino acid ZHX1
protein contains 2 N-terminal zinc fingers, 5 central and C-terminal
homeodomains, a C-terminal acidic region, and 2 putative nuclear
localization signals. Human and mouse ZHX1 share 91% amino acid sequence
identity. The authors demonstrated that ZHX1 specifically interacts with
NFYA both in vivo and in vitro. This interaction does not require the
zinc fingers of ZHX1. Northern blot analysis detected major 4.5- and
5-kb ZHX1 transcripts in all tissues tested, namely heart, lung, liver,
pancreas, kidney, brain, skeletal muscle, and placenta. The 5-kb
transcript was more highly expressed than the 4.5-kb transcript in most
of these tissues.

By analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel, Yamada et al. (1999) mapped
the ZHX1 gene to chromosome 8. They localized the ZHX1 gene to 8q by
radiation hybrid mapping.

614459	TITLE *614459 TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN 138; TMEM138
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TMEM138 is required for the assembly and function of cilia (Lee et al.,
2012).

CLONING

Lee et al. (2012) identified the TMEM138 gene near the TMEM216 (613277)
gene in a region of chromosome 11 linked to Joubert syndrome-2 (JBTS2;
608091). They obtained TMEM138 clones, including potential variants,
from a human fetal brain cDNA library. The deduced major isoform of
TMEM138 contains 162 amino acids and has an N-terminal signal sequence
followed by 3 transmembrane domains. Expression profiling showed TMEM138
expression in all tissues examined. In situ hybridization of human
embryos at 4 to 8 weeks' gestation revealed ubiquitous TMEM138
expression that increased with time. TMEM138 expression appeared to
parallel TMEM216 expression in all tissues examined. Immunohistochemical
analysis of mouse IMCD3 cells and transfected COS-7 cells revealed that
Tmem138 localized to ciliary axoneme/basal body and that Tmem216
localized to basal body and to the Golgi apparatus surrounding the base
of cilium. The 2 proteins also appeared to localize to different vesicle
pools that moved toward the primary cilia over time. Tmem138 vesicles,
but not Tmem216 vesicles, colocalized with endogenous Cep290 (610142) in
IMCD3 cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lee et al. (2012) determined that the TMEM138 gene contains 5 exons, the
first of which is noncoding. The 23-kb intergenic region between TMEM138
and TMEM216 contains a functional conserved RFX4 (603958)-binding site.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Lee et al. (2012) mapped the TMEM138 gene
to chromosome 11q12.2, 23 kb from the TMEM216 gene. TMEM138 and TMEM216
are in a head-to-tail orientation.

Lee et al. (2012) mapped the mouse Tmem138 gene to a region of
chromosome 19 that shares homology of synteny with human chromosome
11q12.2.

GENE FUNCTION

Lee et al. (2012) found that RFX4 mediated coordinated expression of
TMEM138 and TMEM216 by binding to a regulatory element within their
intergenic region. Knockdown of either Tmem138 or Tmem216 in mouse IMCD3
cells resulted in short cilia and a defect in ciliogenesis. Knockdown of
Tmem216 disrupted vesicular trafficking of Tmem138 and Cep290, whereas
knockdown of Tmem138 had little effect on vesicular movement of Tmem216.
Knockdown of Trappc9 (611966), a component of the transport protein
particle (TRAPP) II complex, disrupted vesicular tethering of both
proteins and reduced ciliogenesis.

EVOLUTION

Lee et al. (2012) found that the TMEM138 and TMEM216 genes are aligned
in a head-to-tail orientation, with a conserved intergenic region, in
higher vertebrates only. They determined that the 2 genes came into
close association during an ancient chromosomal rearrangement at the
amphibian-to-reptile transition about 340 million years ago.
Conservation in the intergenic region becomes progressively weaker from
human to anolis lizard, and the orthologous genes map to different
chromosomes in zebrafish.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By repeat sequencing of candidate genes in 6 consanguineous Arab
families with Joubert syndrome showing linkage to the JBTS2 locus
(608091) on chromosome 11q13, but who were negative for mutations in the
TMEM216 gene (613277), Lee et al. (2012) identified homozygous mutations
in the TMEM138 gene (614459.0001-614459.0005). None of the mutations was
found in 400 controls. Two additional patients from consanguineous Arab
families were also found to carry homozygous TMEM138 mutations. The
phenotype included the molar tooth sign on brain imaging, oculomotor
apraxia, variable coloboma, and rare kidney involvement. The phenotype
was indistinguishable from that caused by mutation in TMEM216 gene.

ANIMAL MODEL

Lee et al. (2012) found that knockdown of zebrafish Tmem138 or Tmem216
resulted in similar, but distinct, phenotypes. Knockdown of either gene
resulted in pericardial effusion, curved or kinked tail, and
gastrulation defects. However, only knockdown of Tmem16 resulted in
hydrocephalic brains.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
JOUBERT SYNDROME 16
TMEM138, IVS2DS, G-A, +5

In affected members of 2 consanguineous Arab families with Joubert
syndrome-16 (JBTS16; 614465), Lee et al. (2012) identified a homozygous
G-to-A transition in exon 2 of the TMEM138 gene, resulting in a splice
site mutation at a highly conserved position. Features were somewhat
variable, but included the molar tooth sign on brain imaging, oculomotor
apraxia, and coloboma. One patient had cystic kidneys and another had
polydactyly.

JOUBERT SYNDROME 16
TMEM138, HIS96ARG

In 2 Arab sibs, born of consanguineous parents, with JBTS16 (614465),
Lee et al. (2012) identified a homozygous 287A-G transition in the
TMEM138 gene, resulting in a his96-to-arg (H96R) substitution in a
highly conserved residue. A 17-year-old boy had the molar tooth sign and
a Dandy-Walker malformation, oculomotor apraxia, and nephronophthisis.
An affected fetus had an encephalocele and was diagnosed with Meckel
syndrome. In vitro functional expression studies showed that the mutant
H96R protein was expressed at about 40% of control levels, suggesting a
loss of function as the disease mechanism.

In 3 Arab sibs, born of consanguineous parents, with JBTS16 (614465),

TMEM138 gene, resulting in an ala127-to-val (A127V) substitution in a
highly conserved residue. The patients had the molar tooth sign and
retinal dystrophy.

In 3 patients from 3 consanguineous Arab families with JBTS16 (614465),

TMEM138 gene, resulting in an ala126-to-thr (A126T) substitution in a
highly conserved residue. All patients had the molar tooth sign and
oculomotor apraxia, and 2 had coloboma.

In a patient, born of consanguineous Arab parents, with JBTS16 (614465),

TMEM138 gene, resulting in a tyr130-to-cys (Y130C) substitution in a
highly conserved residue. The patient had the molar tooth sign,
oculomotor apraxia, coloboma, and cystic kidneys. Six deceased sibs were
reportedly affected.

603291	TITLE *603291 BCL2/ADENOVIRUS E1B 19-KD PROTEIN-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1; BNIP1
;;NIP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid system to identify proteins that interact with
discrete domains of the E1B 19-kD protein, which is involved in
suppression of cell death, Boyd et al. (1994) cloned human B-cell cDNAs
encoding NIP1, NIP2 (603292), and NIP3 (603293). The deduced NIP1
protein has 228 amino acids and contains a putative membrane-spanning
hydrophobic domain. Although the authors found no significant sequence
homology between NIP1 and other proteins, they identified a 59- to
83-amino acid region of NIP1 that shows 29% to 36% identity to a
conserved region within the catalytic domain of 3 mammalian
3-prime-5-prime-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases. Boyd et al. (1994)
localized NIP1 to the nuclear envelope region and to other cytoplasmic
structures.

GENE FUNCTION

Adenovirus E1B 19-kD protein protects against cell death induced by
viral infection and certain external stimuli. Using yeast 2-hybrid
analysis, Boyd et al. (1994) showed that NIP1, NIP2, and NIP3 interacted
with the adenovirus E1B 19-kD protein and with human BCL2 (151430),
which can functionally substitute for the 19-kD protein during
adenovirus infection. The interactions occurred at bipartite sequence
motifs common to both the E1B 19-kD and BCL2 proteins.

MAPPING

Gross (2012) mapped the BNIP1 gene to chromosome 5q35.1 based on an
alignment of the BNIP1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF083956) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;ACETYLCHOLINE RECEPTOR, NEURONAL NICOTINIC, BETA-4 SUBUNIT
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are members of a
superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels that mediate fast signal
transmission at synapses. The nAChRs are thought to be (hetero)pentamers
composed of homologous subunits. See 118508 for additional background
information on AChRs.

Tarroni et al. (1992) cloned a partial beta-4 subunit cDNA by screening
a human neuroblastoma cDNA library with a rat beta-4 subunit probe.
Using Northern blots and RT-PCR, Tarroni et al. (1992) found that the
human beta-4 subunit is expressed as a 3.1-kb mRNA in neuroblastoma and
small-cell lung carcinoma cell lines. Elliott et al. (1996) isolated a
complete beta-4 clone from a neuroblastoma cell line cDNA library. The
predicted 498-amino acid protein is 84% identical to rat beta-4 protein.
They demonstrated that human beta-4 encoded a functional receptor when
expressed in combination with alpha-2 (118502), alpha-3 (118503), or
alpha-4 (118504) subunits in Xenopus oocytes. Groot Kormelink and Luyten
(1997) also cloned a complete beta-4 cDNA from neuroblastoma cell line
mRNA. On Northern blots of a neuroblastoma cell line, Groot Kormelink
and Luyten (1997) found that the human beta-4 subunit is expressed as a
2.4-kb mRNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Transmitter-gated cation channels are detectors of excitatory chemical
signals at synapses in the nervous system. Khakh et al. (2000) showed
that structurally distinct alpha-3-beta-4 nicotinic and P2X(2) (600844)
channels influence each other when coactivated. The activation of one
channel type affects distinct kinetic and conductance states of the
other, and coactivation results in nonadditive responses owing to
inhibition of both channel types. State-dependent inhibition of
nicotinic channels was revealed most clearly with mutant P2X(2)
channels, and inhibition was decreased at lower densities of channel
expression. In synaptically coupled myenteric neurons, nicotinic fast
excitatory postsynaptic currents were occluded during activation of
endogenously coexpressed P2X channels. Khakh et al. (2000) concluded
that their data provide a molecular basis and a synaptic context for
cross-inhibition between transmitter-gated channels.

Lou et al. (2007) reported a generalized MDR (GMDR) method that
permitted adjustment for discrete and quantitative covariates and was
applicable to both dichotomous and continuous phenotypes in
population-based studies of various designs. They applied the method to
a genetic study of 4 genes that were reported to be associated with
nicotine dependence (188890): CHRNA2 (118502), CHRNB4, BDNF (113503),
and NTRK2 (600456). They found significant joint action between CHRNB4
and NTRK2. Lou et al. (2007) commented that ubiquity of joint actions
appears to be a natural property of complex inherited traits and that
the term 'epistasis,' coined for a specific type of gene-by-gene
interaction, has evolved to have different meanings in biologic and
statistical genetics.

By using a combination of pharmacologic, molecular genetic,
electrophysiologic, and feeding studies, Mineur et al. (2011) found that
activation of hypothalamic alpha-3 (118503)-beta-4 nicotinic
acetylcholine receptors leads to activation of proopiomelanocortin
(POMC; 176830) neurons. POMC neurons and subsequent activation of
melanocortin-4 receptors (MC4R; 155541) were critical for
nicotinic-induced decreases in food intake in mice. The study of Mineur
et al. (2011) demonstrated that nicotine decreases food intake and body
weight by influencing the hypothalamic melanocortin system and
identified critical molecular and synaptic mechanisms involved in
nicotine-induced decreases in appetite.

MAPPING

Raimondi et al. (1992) mapped the CHRNA3 (118503), CHRNA5 (118505), and
CHRNB4 genes to 15q24 by in situ hybridization and demonstrated that the
3 genes are physically linked.

Amos et al. (2008) placed the CHRNA3, CHRNA5, CHRNB4, and PSMA4 (176846)
genes within a 100-kb region on chromosome 15q25.1.

136836	TITLE *136836 FUCOSYLTRANSFERASE 6; FUT6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The alpha-1,3-fucosyltransferases constitute a large family of
glycosyltransferases with a high degree of homology. The enzymes of this
family comprise 3 main activity patterns called myeloid, plasma, and
Lewis, based on their capacity to transfer alpha-L-fucose to distinct
oligosaccharide acceptors, their sensitivity to N-ethylmaleimide
inhibition, their cation requirements, and their tissue-specific
expression patterns. The different categories of
alpha-1,3-fucosyltransferases are sequentially expressed during
embryo-fetal development. FUT6 encodes a 'plasma type' of
alpha-1,3-fucosyltransferase (summary by Mollicone et al., 1994).

CLONING

Weston et al. (1992) isolated and cloned a novel
alpha(1,3)fucosyltransferase gene, which they designated FUT6, which
encodes a deduced 358-amino acid protein. FUT6 shares 85% and 89% amino
acid sequence identity with FUT3 (111100) and FUT5 (136835),
respectively, but differs substantially in its acceptor substrate
requirements.

Koszdin and Bowen (1992) amplified FUT6 by PCR of a squamous carcinoma
cell line and a myeloid leukemia cell line.

Cameron et al. (1995) studied the tissue distribution of FUT6 by RT-PCR,
RACE, and Northern blot analysis. They found that FUT6 was expressed at
high levels as a 3.5-kb transcript in kidney and liver and as a 2.5-kb
transcript in colon and liver. They identified alternate polyadenylation
sites as well as splice variants resulting in deletion of the catalytic
domain. By RT-PCR, Schnyder-Candrian et al. (2000) found FUT6 to be the
major fucosyltransferase of human umbilical vein endothelial cells.
Immunolocalization showed that FUT6 colocalizes with
beta-4-galactosyltransferase-1 (B4GALT1; 137060) in compact juxtanuclear
structures typical of the Golgi apparatus. Antibodies raised against
another epitope of FUT6 localized the enzyme to Weibel-Palade bodies,
endothelial storage granules.

MAPPING

By PCR analysis of somatic cell hybrid DNAs, Weston et al. (1992)
demonstrated that the FUT6 gene is located on chromosome 19, where the
Lewis blood group gene (FUT3; 111100) had long been known to be located.

McCurley et al. (1995) demonstrated that FUT5, FUT3, and FUT6 are
located in the 19p13.3 region in an interval of about 40 kb. They are
situated in close proximity and the direction of transcription of all 3
is toward the telomere. The organization may suggest coordinate
regulation.

GENE FUNCTION

Weston et al. (1992) found that when FUT6 was transfected into mammalian
cells, it was capable of directing expression of the Lewis x, sialyl
Lewis x, and difucosyl sialyl Lewis x epitopes.

Koszdin and Bowen (1992) also showed that transfection of FUT6 cDNA into
mammalian cells conferred alpha-1,3-fucosyltransferase activity to the
cells, resulting in cell surface expression of Lewis x and sialyl Lewis
x carbohydrates.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Whereas most humans express an alpha-1,3-fucosyltransferase in plasma,
9% of individuals on the isle of Java (Indonesia) do not express this
enzyme. The Lewis negative phenotype is found on red cells of 95% of
these FUT-deficient individuals, suggesting strong linkage
disequilibrium between these 2 traits. To define a molecular basis for
this plasma FUT deficiency (613852) and to determine which of 2
candidate human FUT genes, FUT5 (136835) and FUT6, encode this enzyme,
Mollicone et al. (1994) cloned and analyzed alleles at these 2 loci from
an Indonesian individual with fucosyltransferase deficiency. Single
basepair changes were identified in the coding region of each gene,
yielding 3 codon changes in FUT5 and 3 in FUT6. Only the changes in the
FUT6 alleles inactivated the gene when tested by expression in
transfected COS-1 cells. One of these inactivating changes was a
missense mutation (glu247-to-lys) within the enzyme's catalytic domain.
The other inactivating mutation, a nonsense tyr315-to-ter change,
truncated the C terminus of the enzyme by 45 amino acids. The
glu247-to-lys missense mutation was present in homozygous state in 9
plasma FUT-deficient individuals tested, whereas the nonsense mutation
at tyrosine-315 was present in homozygous state in only 1 of these 9
persons. These results demonstrated that the
alpha-1,3-fucosyltransferase activity in human plasma is encoded by the
FUT6 gene and that the missense mutation within codon 247 of this gene
is responsible for the Indonesian deficiency of this activity.

Brinkman-Van der Linden et al. (1996) found that all individuals with a
homozygous gly739-to-ala FUT6 mutation showed no fucosylation of
alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. The same result was found for
alpha-1-antichymotrypsin and alpha-1-protease inhibitor. On the other
hand, in all individuals with alpha-3-fucosyltransferase activity in the
plasma, alpha-3-fucosylated glycoforms of the glycoproteins studied were
found. Thus, their data suggested that the product of FUT6, but not of
FUT3 or of FUT5, is responsible for the alpha-3-fucosylation of
glycoproteins produced in liver and suggested that this organ is a major
source of alpha-3-fucosyltransferase activity in plasma.

Pang et al. (1999) sequenced the 1080-bp coding region of the FUT6 gene
in 161 individuals (322 chromosomes) drawn from 3 populations: 56
Africans (Xhosa), 52 European-Africans of South Africa, and 53 Japanese.
In addition to 6 base substitutions previously reported, 11 new base
substitutions and a single base insertion were found. They also
identified 11 functional and 4 null alleles, of which 10 were novel. The
allelic distributions of FUT6 were different among these 3 populations.
The heterozygosity of FUT6 was 0.860, 0.699, and 0.632 in the 3
populations, respectively. Pang et al. (1999) suggested that the
extensive DNA sequence diversity of FUT6 may make it suitable as a tool
in genetic studies of modern human evolution.

;;ARVP;;
VASOPRESSIN-NEUROPHYSIN II;;
ANTIDIURETIC HORMONE; ADH
NEUROPHYSIN II, INCLUDED; NPII, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The arginine vasopressin (AVP) gene encodes prepro-AVP, which consists
of a signal peptide, AVP, neurophysin II (NPII), and a glycoprotein,
copeptin (summary by Mahoney et al., 2002).

CLONING

Land et al. (1982) sequenced a cDNA clone that encoded bovine arginine
vasopressin-neurophysin II (AVP-NpII) precursor.

GENE FUNCTION

Sachs et al. (1969) suggested that arginine vasopressin and its
corresponding neurophysin are synthesized in the form of a common
precursor which is cleaved by proteolysis to yield the biologically
functional peptides. Rats with hereditary diabetes insipidus are
deficient in synthesis of both arginine vasopressin and one species of
neurophysin (Sunde and Sokol, 1975). Both of the nonapeptide hormones
arginine vasopressin and oxytocin (OXT; 167050) are synthesized in the
supraoptic nucleus (SON) and paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the
hypothalamus together with their respective 'carrier' proteins, the
neurophysins (Brownstein et al., 1980). Vasopressin and oxytocin are
produced by separate populations of magnocellular neurons in both
nuclei. Together with the neurophysins they are packaged into
neurosecretory vesicles and transported axonally to the nerve endings in
the neurohypophysis, where they are either stored or secreted into the
bloodstream. In addition to having 9 amino acids, each has a disulfide
bond between the cysteines at positions 1 and 6. Ganz et al. (1989)
provided evidence that the hormone regulates pH in the presence of
bicarbonate by stimulating 3 acid-base transport systems.

Gabreels et al. (1998) showed 7B2 (173120) immunoreactivity in the
supraoptic nucleus or the paraventricular nucleus in only 3 of 5
Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) patients. In contrast with 5 other PWS
patients, the neurons in the hypothalamic SON and PVN of the two
7B2-immunonegative PWS patients also failed to show any reaction using 2
antibodies directed against processed vasopressin (VP). On the other
hand, even these 2 cases reacted normally with 5 antibodies that
recognize different parts of the VP precursor. This finding pointed to a
processing defect. The same patients had no PC2 (162151)
immunoreactivity in the SON or PVN, whereas PC1 (162150)
immunoreactivity was only slightly diminished. The authors concluded
that in the VP neurons of 2 PWS patients, the amounts of 7B2 and PC2
present are greatly reduced, resulting in diminished VP precursor
processing.

The PVN and the SON in the rat contain estrogen-regulated oxytocin and
arginine-vasopressin systems, but little or no estrogen receptor-alpha
(133430). Using estradiol-treated ovariectomized young adult
Sprague-Dawley rats and dual-labeled immunocytochemistry, Alves et al.
(1998) showed that OXT-ir (OXT-immunoreactivity) colocalized with
ESR-beta (601663)-ir in the parvicellular subnuclei of PVN but there was
little AVP-/ESR-beta-ir. In contrast, in the SON, most nuclear
ESR-beta-ir colocalized with AVP-ir, whereas few OXT-/ESR-beta-ir
dual-labeled cells were observed. These results suggested that estrogen
can directly modulate specific OXT and AVP systems through an
ESR-beta-mediated mechanism, in a tissue specific manner.

Growth hormone (GH; 139250) secretagogues (GHSs) act via specific
receptors in the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland to release GH (see
601898). GHSs also stimulate the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)
axis via central mechanisms probably involving corticotropin-releasing
hormone (CRH; 122560) or AVP. Korbonits et al. (1999) studied the
effects of the GHS hexarelin, CRH, and desmopressin, an AVP analog, on
stimulation of the HPA axis in 15 healthy young male volunteers. They
concluded that the effect of GHSs on the HPA axis does not involve CRH,
but may occur through the stimulation of AVP release.

Tobin et al. (2010) reported that the rat olfactory bulb contains a
large population of interneurons which express vasopressin, that
blocking the actions of vasopressin in the olfactory bulb impairs the
social recognition abilities of rats, and that vasopressin agonists and
antagonists can modulate the processing of information by olfactory bulb
neurons. Tobin et al. (2010) concluded that social information is
processed in part by a vasopressin system intrinsic to the olfactory
system.

GENE STRUCTURE

Vasopressin is synthesized as a much larger precursor which
includes--besides the hormone--its carrier protein, neurophysin, and a
glycoprotein. The functional domains of the protein precursor are coded
by 3 exons separated by 2 introns. The first exon encodes the hormone,
the second most of the carrier protein, and the third the glycoprotein
(summary by Schmale et al., 1984).

Sausville et al. (1985) found that the genes for
prepro-arginine-vasopressin-neurophysin II (AVP) and
prepro-oxytocin-neurophysin I (OXT; 167050) have a similar intron-exon
structure, are linked (on chromosome 20) with 12 kb intervening DNA, and
are transcribed from opposite DNA strands. In a human small cell lung
cancer (182280) cell line, they found that the first but not the second
strand was actively transcribed.

MAPPING

The structural gene for AVP was assigned to chromosome 20 by means of a
gene probe in somatic cell hybrids (Riddell et al., 1985); the gene
probe was for arginine vasopressin/neurophysin II.

By use of a RFLP located near the ARVP/OXT complex, Summar et al. (1990)
accumulated linkage data showing that the AVP and OXT genes are located
on the distal short arm of chromosome 20 about 15 cM toward the telomere
from the D20S5 locus, which is located near the middle of the short arm
of 20p12.21. Thus, the location of the gene can be stated as
20pter-p12.21. The mapping of the neighboring gene OXT to 20p13 by both
isotopic and fluorescence in situ hybridization (Gopal Rao et al., 1992)
means that AVP is also in band 20p13.

In the mouse, Marini et al. (1993) noted that Avp and Oxt are separated
by only 3.5 kb of intergenic sequence. By interspecific backcross
analysis, they mapped this pair of genes to mouse chromosome 2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Ito et al. (1991) showed that central diabetes insipidus (125700) was
caused by a gly57-to-ser substitution (192340.0001) of the AVP gene in 2
patients.

Rittig et al. (1996) identified 13 new mutations in the AVP gene in 17
unrelated kindreds with familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus.
They sequenced all 3 exons of the gene by using a rapid, direct
dye-terminator method and found the site of mutation in each case. Four
of the mutations had been described previously. There were 2 missense
mutations that altered the cleavage region of the signal peptide, 7
missense mutations in exon 2, which codes for the conserved portion of
the protein, 1 nonsense mutation in exon 2, and 3 nonsense mutations in
exon 3. The affected individuals were heterozygous for the mutations as
expected in this autosomal dominant disorder.

Repaske et al. (1996) examined the AVP gene in 3 unrelated kindreds with
autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus. They identified
3 different mutations, each of which represented a recurrence of a
previously described mutation. All 3 were transitions; 2 occurred in the
NPII moiety and 1 in the last amino acid at the C terminus of the signal
peptide. To determine if these apparent recurrent mutations arose
independently rather than from ancestral founder mutations, Repaske et
al. (1996) examined family origins, polymorphic markers on chromosome 20
in close proximity to AVP, and/or the occurrence of a de novo mutation
in these 3 families and compared the data to 4 previously reported
families. The results suggested that the mutations probably arose
independently in 2 of the 3 families but that 1 family may share an
ancestral founder mutation with a previously reported family.

Christensen et al. (2004) screened for mutations in the AVP gene in 1 or
more affected members of 15 unrelated kindreds in which diabetes
insipidus appeared to be segregating. In each of 6 kindreds, they
identified a unique novel mutation, 2 in the translation initiation
codon of the AVP pre-prohormone signal peptide and 4 that predict
substitutions in the NPII moiety of the AVP prohormone. In the other 9
kindreds, 7 different previously described mutations were identified.
Christensen et al. (2004) suggested that mutations in the AVP gene
causing familial central diabetes insipidus affect amino acid residues
known or presumed to be important for the proper folding and/or
dimerization of the NPII moiety of the AVP prohormone.

Ito et al. (1997) expressed wildtype and different mutant AVP genes in
neuro2A neuroblastoma cells. When cells were treated with valproic acid
to induce neuronal differentiation, each of the mutants caused reduced
viability. Metabolic labeling revealed diminished intracellular
trafficking of mutant AVP precursors and confirmed inefficient secretion
of immunoreactive AVP. Immunofluorescence studies demonstrated marked
accumulation of mutant AVP precursors within the endoplasmic reticulum.
These studies suggested that the cellular toxicity in familial
neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus may be caused by the intracellular
accumulation of mutant precursor proteins.

To elucidate the mechanism of neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus,
Nijenhuis et al. (1999) stably expressed 5 vasopressin prohormones with
a mutation in the neurophysin moiety in 2 neuroendocrine cell lines. The
mutations studied included G57S (192340.0001) and G65V (192340.0008).
Metabolic labeling demonstrated that the processing and secretion of all
5 mutants was impaired, albeit to different extents, the impairment
being greatest in G65V and least in G57S. Persisting endoglycosidase H
sensitivity showed that these defects were associated with retention of
mutant prohormone in the endoplasmic reticulum. Mutant prohormones that
partially passed the endoplasmic reticulum were normally targeted to the
regulated secretory pathway. This also included mutants with mutations
in residues involved in binding of vasopressin to neurophysin, a process
implicated in targeting of the prohormone. To mimic the high expression
in vasopressin-producing neurons, mutant vasopressin prohormones were
transiently expressed in one of the 2 neuroendocrine cell lines.
Immunofluorescence displayed formation of large accumulations of mutant
prohormone in the endoplasmic reticulum, accompanied by redistribution
of an endoplasmic reticulum marker. The data suggested that prolonged
perturbation of the endoplasmic reticulum eventually leads to
degeneration of neurons expressing mutant vasopressin prohormones,
explaining the dominant nature of the disease.

Christensen et al. (2004) compared the cellular handling of the
recessive P26L (see 192340.0016) and dominant Y21H (see 192340.0018)
prohormones and demonstrated that the recessive mutation does not seem
to affect the intracellular trafficking but rather the final processing
of the prohormone. The authors determined that their results provided an
important negative control in support of the hypothesis that autosomal
dominant inheritance of familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus is
caused by mutations in the AVP gene that alter amino acids important for
folding and/or dimerization of the neurophysin II moiety of the AVP
prohormone and subsequent transport from the endoplasmic reticulum.

ANIMAL MODEL

A single-nucleotide deletion is found in the second exon in the
Brattleboro rat with diabetes insipidus (Schmale et al., 1984). Diabetes
insipidus in the Brattleboro rat is autosomal recessive (Valtin et al.,
1965); in man, a recessive form is probably a rarity (see 125800). In
studies of the homozygous (di/di) Brattleboro rat with severe diabetes
insipidus, Evans et al. (1994) found evidence indicating that
nondividing neurons can be subject to somatic mutations at high
frequency. They reported specific frameshift mutations occurring in
postmitotic neurons. The mutations were identified in vasopressin
transcripts in magnocellular neurons of the homozygous rats and
consisted predominantly of a GA deletion in GAGAG motifs.
Immunocytochemistry provided evidence for similar events in wildtype
rats. However, the diseased state of the Brattleboro rat, resulting in a
permanent activation of vasopressin neurons, enhanced the mutation rate.

In Alzheimer disease (AD; 104300) and Down syndrome (190685) patients,
van Leeuwen et al. (1998) demonstrated the cellular colocalization of
truncated forms of ubiquitin-B (UBB; 191339) and beta-amyloid precursor
protein (APP; 104760) and involvement with a similar type of mutation
operating at the transcriptional level or by posttranscriptional editing
of RNA. They suggested that transcript mutation may be a widely
occurring phenomenon. The frequently mutated motif in exon 9 of the APP
gene transcript (GAGAGAGA) is an extended version of the GAGAG motif of
the AVP transcript that is frequently involved in a GA dinucleotide
deletion in the homozygous Brattleboro rat.

In 2 patients with central diabetes insipidus (125700) from a pedigree
consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance, Ito et al. (1991) used
PCR to amplify fragments including the promoter region and all coding
regions from genomic DNA. Direct sequencing showed that 1 of the 2 ARVP
genes contained a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 1859 in the second
exon, resulting in substitution of serine for glycine at amino acid
position 57 in the neurophysin II moiety of the gene. Ito et al. (1991)
also sequenced the AVP-NPII gene in 10 patients with idiopathic central
diabetes insipidus, of whom 5 had juvenile onset. No difference in
sequence was found compared with normal subjects. Autoimmunity has been
proposed as one cause of idiopathic diabetes insipidus (Scherbaum and
Bottazzo, 1983).

(125700) could be traced back for 5 generations, Bahnsen et al. (1992)
identified a G-to-T transversion within the neurophysin-encoding exon B,
which converted a highly conserved glycine (gly17 of neurophysin) to a
valine residue.

Olias et al. (1996) examined whether this point mutation affects the
processing and transport of the vasopressin-neurophysin precursor. They
stably expressed the normal and mutant vasopressin cDNAs under the
control of the cytomegalovirus promoter in the mouse pituitary cell line
AtT20. The mutant precursor was synthesized, but processing and
secretion were dramatically reduced compared to the normal. The mutant
neurophysin staining was restricted to the endoplasmic reticulum and
never reached the trans-Golgi network, whereas the normal neurophysin
concentrated in the tips of the cell processes where secretory granules
accumulate. These results suggested that the mutation alters the
conformation of the precursor, impairs its intracellular transport, and
triggers its retention.

AVP, ALA-1THR

In 23 individuals with central diabetes insipidus (125700) spanning 4
generations of a Japanese family, Ito et al. (1993) discovered a G-to-A
transition at nucleotide 279 in exon 1 of the ARVP gene, causing
substitution of thr (ACG) for ala (GCG) at -1 position (A-1T), the
carboxy end, of the signal peptide of prepro-VP. They suggested that
insufficient processing of prepro-VP produced by the mutant allele is
involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes insipidus in this family. A
similar defect in cleavage by signal peptidase occurs in factor X (Santo
Domingo) with resulting bleeding diathesis (227600.0005). Similarly, a
point mutation in the signal peptide-encoding region of the PTH gene has
been demonstrated as the cause of familial isolated hypoparathyroidism
(168450.0001). Precisely the same mutation was found by McLeod et al.
(1993) in a Caucasian American kindred with 14 affected members. The
mutation was also found in 2 infants in whom AVP was normal when tested
at 6 and 9 months of age. This led McLeod et al. (1993) to hypothesize
that a mutation in exon 1 of the AVP-neurophysin-II gene causes
neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus by making an abnormally processed
precursor that gradually destroys vasopressinergic neurons. Krishnamani
et al. (1993) found the same mutation in 15 members of a 4-generation
family, some members of which were reported by Doherty-Fuller and
Copeland (1988).

Siggaard et al. (1999) carried out genetic analysis and clinical studies
of AVP secretion, urinary AVP, and urine output in 16 affected and 16
unaffected family members and 11 spouses of a Danish kindred with
neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus who carried the A-1T mutation.
Mutant cDNA carrying the same mutation was expressed in a neurogenic
cell line, and the cellular effects were studied by Western blot
analysis, immunocytochemistry, and AVP measurements. Clinical studies
showed a severe progressive deficiency of plasma and urinary AVP that
manifested during childhood. Expression studies demonstrated that the
A-1T mutant cells produced 8-fold less AVP than wildtype cells and
accumulated excessive amounts of 23-kD NPII protein corresponding to
uncleaved prepro-AVP-NPII. Furthermore, a substantial portion of the
intracellular AVP-NPII precursor appeared to be colocalized with an
endoplasmic reticulum antigen (Grp78). The authors concluded that the
A-1T mutation produces neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus by directing
the production of a mutant preprohormone that accumulates in the
endoplasmic reticulum, because it cannot be cleaved from the signal
peptide and transported to neurosecretory vesicles for further
processing and secretion.

AVP, 3-BP DEL, NT1824

In a family with central diabetes insipidus (125700) in an autosomal
dominant pedigree pattern, Yuasa et al. (1993) demonstrated a 3-bp
deletion (AGG) out of 2 consecutive AGG sequences (nucleotides
1824-1829) in 1 AVP allele. Cosegregation of the mutation with the DI
phenotype in the family was confirmed by restriction enzyme analyses.
The mutation was predicted to yield an abnormal AVP precursor lacking
glu47 (E47) in its neurophysin-II moiety. Since glu47 (E47) is essential
for NP molecules to form a salt bridge with AVP, the function of NP as a
carrier protein for AVP would be impaired. As a result, AVP probably
undergoes accelerated proteolytic degradation.

To determine whether the clinical course of autosomal dominant NDI is
compatible with the hypothesis that the neuropathologic findings are
attributable to a progressive loss of magnocellular neurons beginning in
early life, Mahoney et al. (2002) performed posterior pituitary magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) and water deprivation tests, including plasma
adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) measurements, on 17 affected members of a
kindred with the delta-E47 neurophysin mutation whose ages ranged from 3
months to 54 years. Nine adult unaffected members aged 20 to 56 years
underwent these tests as controls. All 6 children undergoing MRI
demonstrated a posterior pituitary hyperintense signal (PPHS). Eight of
9 affected adults showed an absent or barely visible PPHS, whereas 8 of
9 age-matched unaffected adults produced a normal size PPHS. During
water deprivation tests, infants concentrated their urine normally, and
a 3-month-old infant produced a high plasma AVP level of 15.7
pmol/liter. By school age, affected children were no longer able to
concentrate their urine or prevent hypernatremia. Affected adults became
dehydrated; their median plasma AVP level was less than 1.0 pmol/liter,
but their median fasting plasma ACTH was 2-fold greater than the level
of unaffected adults (10.0 vs 5.0 pmol/liter; P = 0.008). The authors
concluded that autosomal dominant NDI is a progressive disease
associated with chronic loss of the magnocellular neurons that supply
AVP to the posterior pituitary but preservation of the parvocellular
neurons that supply AVP and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH;
122560) to the median eminence and stimulate ACTH production during
hypernatremia.

AVP, CYS67TER

In a Japanese pedigree with familial central diabetes insipidus
(125700), Nagasaki et al. (1995) demonstrated a TGC-to-TGA transition at
nucleotide position 1891 that generated a cys67-to-ter (C67X) change. As
the premature termination eliminated part of the COOH domain of the NPII
moiety and the glycoprotein moiety, the conformation of the protein was
probably markedly changed. A history of diabetes insipidus was obtained
in 3 members of the family spanning 3 generations.

Russell et al. (2003) established a murine knockin model of the human
C67X mutation. Heterozygous mice exhibited polyuria and polydipsia by 2
months of age, and these features of diabetes insipidus progressively
worsened with age. In addition, Avp gene products were not detected in
the neuronal projections, suggesting retention of wildtype and mutant
AVP precursors within the cell bodies. This murine model recapitulated
many features of the human disorder and demonstrated that expression of
the mutant AVP precursor leads to progressive neuronal cell loss, a
'dominant-negative' effect.

In a Japanese kindred with familial central diabetes insipidus (125700),

Rutishauser et al. (1996) identified a novel single base deletion (G227)
in the translation initiation codon of the AVP signal peptide in a
3-generation kindred with familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus
(125700). The mutation deletes nucleotide 227, the third base of the
initiation codon (ATG), and this may cause alternative use of an ATG
which is 4 triplets downstream. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies
showed the 'bright spot' that is characteristic of the posterior
pituitary in 2 unaffected family members whereas this was absent in all
4 affected family members studied. This absence may reflect the
deficient posterior pituitary function.

In a Japanese family with familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus
(125700), Ueta et al. (1996) found a G-to-T transversion of nucleotide
1884 in exon 2, resulting in a gly65-to-val substitution in the AVP
gene. (Note: the authors stated incorrectly in the abstract that the
substitution was 'glycine (Gly) for valine (Val)'.) To examine the
presence of this mutation in affected subjects, they designed 2 mutated
primers: by PCR amplification, 1 of the primers induced a new
endonuclease restriction site in the PCR fragment from normal persons,
while the other induced a different endonuclease restriction site from
patients with the mutation. Subsequently, restriction analysis of PCR
fragments and sequencing of genomic DNA indicated that affected subjects
were heterozygous for normal and mutant alleles.

AVP, ALA-1VAL

Repaske et al. (1997) identified a C-to-T transition in exon 1 of the
AVP gene causing an ala280-to-val substitution in the coding sequence
for the C terminus of the signal peptide (-1 amino acid) of the
prepro-AVP-NPII precursor in 2 independent families with autosomal
dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (125700). This mutation
predicts the complete inability of signal peptidase to cleave the signal
peptide from the preproprecursor and supports the hypothesis that the
progressive neurodegeneration that underlies neurohypophyseal diabetes
insipidus is caused by accumulation of malprocessed precursor.
Considerable heterogeneity in the age of onset (1 to 28 years of age)
and the severity of diabetes insipidus among affected members of these 2
families suggested that additional factors modulate the rate and extent
of progression of the neurodegeneration that results from this specific
mutation.

Heppner et al. (1998) found the same mutation in 2 children of an
affected father. Both children had onset of symptoms by 1 year of age.

In a girl with familial central diabetes insipidus (125700) who
presented at 9 months of age, and in her similarly affected younger
brother and father, Gagliardi et al. (1997) identified a 1758G-T
transversion in the AVP gene, resulting in a gly23-to-val substitution
in NPII. T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of the father's
pituitary gland showed an attenuated posterior pituitary bright spot.
The authors concluded that studies of this mutation may be useful in
developing models of dominantly inherited neurodegeneration because the
early age of onset of symptoms suggests that this mutation may be
particularly deleterious to the magnocellular neuron.

In all affected individuals of a Spanish kindred with familial
neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus, Calvo et al. (1999) identified
heterozygosity for a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 1757 of the AVP
gene, resulting in a gly23-to-arg substitution in the NPII domain. The
substitution was confirmed by restriction endonuclease analysis.
Additionally, one of the asymptomatic relatives, an 8-month-old girl,
was identified as being heterozygous for the same mutation and developed
the disease 3 months later.

Calvo et al. (1998) analyzed 2 families with familial neurohypophyseal

novel nonsense mutation in exon 3 of the AVP gene, consisting in a
G-to-T transversion at nucleotide 2101, which produces a stop signal in
codon 82 (glu) of NPII. The premature termination eliminates part of the
C-terminal domain of NPII, including a cysteine residue in position 85,
which may be involved in correct folding of the prohormone. In the
second family, heterozygosity for a 279G-A transition resulting in a
change of alanine to threonine at position -1 of the signal peptide
(192340.0003) was observed in all affected individuals.

Grant et al. (1998) identified 2 novel mutations of the AVP gene in 2
kindreds with familial diabetes insipidus (125700). In each kindred, the
inheritance of the diabetes insipidus phenotype was consistent with an
autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. The proband and 2 other members
of 1 kindred were heterozygous for a C-to-T transition at nucleotide
1857, predicting a ser-to-phe substitution at residue 56 of the
vasopressin-related neurophysin peptide encoded by the mutant allele.
The proband of the other kindred was heterozygous for a G-to-A

In a consanguineous Palestinian family with neurohypophyseal diabetes
insipidus (125700), Willcutts et al. (1999) identified a C-to-T
transition at nucleotide 301 (C301T) in exon 1 of the AVP gene,
replacing proline-7 of mature AVP with leucine (Leu-AVP). All 3 affected
children were homozygous for the mutation, and the parents were
heterozygous. The authors determined that Leu-AVP is a weak agonist with
approximately 30-fold reduced binding to the human V2 receptor. Serum
Leu-AVP levels were elevated in all 3 children and further increased
during water deprivation to as high as 30 times normal, as measured by
radioimmunoassay. The youngest child (2 years old) was only mildly
affected, but had Leu-AVP levels similar to her severely affected
8-year-old brother, suggesting to the authors that unknown mechanisms
may partially compensate for a deficiency of active AVP in very young
children.

Christensen et al. (2004) investigated the cellular handling of the P26L
prohormone (P7L in the mature AVP protein) by heterologous expression in
neurogenic and neuronal cell lines. Secretion of P26L prohormone was
unaffected compared to wildtype prohormone. Confocal laser scanning
microscopy showed localization of the P26L prohormone and/or processed
products in secretory granules in the cellular processes. Christensen et
al. (2004) concluded that the recessive P26L mutation does not seem to
affect intracellular trafficking but rather the final processing of the
AVP prohormone.

In a Dutch family in which familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus
(125700) had been diagnosed, Abbes et al. (2000) identified a cysteine
(TGC)-to-glycine (GGC) substitution at codon 116 of the AVP gene.
Nijenhuis et al. (2001) analyzed the intracellular transport of the
mutant vasopressin prohormone in stably transfected cell lines that
contained a regulated secretory pathway. Nijenhuis et al. (2001)
referred to the mutation as NP85C-G. In 2 children from this kindred
they found that growth retardation was an important early sign that
responded to substitution therapy with 1-desamino-8-D-arginine
vasopressin. To obtain clues about the basis for the dominant
inheritance of familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus, they
analyzed the trafficking and processing of the mutant vasopressin
prohormone in cell lines by metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation.
The mutant vasopressin prohormone was retained in the endoplasmic
reticulum and thus was not processed to vasopressin. The defect was not
caused by dimerization of the vasopressin prohormone via its unpaired
cysteine residue. High-level expression of the mutant vasopressin
prohormone in cell lines resulted in strong accumulation in the
endoplasmic reticulum and an altered morphology of this organelle. The
authors hypothesized that disturbance of the endoplasmic reticulum
results in dysfunction and ultimately cell death of the cells expressing
the mutant prohormone.

Rittig et al. (2002) reported a 3-generation Turkish kindred in which
severe familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (125700)
cosegregated with a novel missense mutation in the part of the AVP-NPII
gene encoding the AVP moiety. A heterozygous T-to-C transition at
position 285 in the genomic sequence predicted a tyr2-to-his (Y2H)
substitution. Like other mutations in the AVP gene that result in
diabetes insipidus, this substitution was expected to impair folding and
processing of the precursor, in this case by interfering with normal
binding of the AVP and NPII moieties. It was associated clinically with
inability to concentrate urine during fluid deprivation, a greater than
80% deficiency of AVP secretion, and absence of the posterior pituitary
bright spot on magnetic resonance imaging.

Christensen et al. (2004) investigated the cellular handling of the Y21H
prohormone (Y2H in the mature AVP protein) by heterologous expression in
neurogenic and neuronal cell lines. Immunoprecipitation demonstrated
retarded processing and secretion of the Y21H prohormone. Confocal laser

substitution (V67A). The authors noted that the mutation affects a
region of NPII unaffected by known AVP mutations and produces only a
minor change in the protein. They also noted that the inheritance
pattern was atypical and suggested incomplete penetrance. The proband
apparently inherited the disease through his affected mother, although
allegedly neither of his maternal grandparents had a history of
polyuria, but a brother of the maternal grandmother was affected.

In an American kindred with autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes

nucleotides in exon 1 of the AVP gene, either CTT or TTC, resulting in
deletion of the phenylalanine at codon 3 (F3del). The index patient was
a 78-year-old man noted to have hypotonic polyuria after a surgical
procedure. He had experienced polyuria and polydipsia since childhood
but had avoided medical attention by assiduously maintaining access to
water at all times. His family had recognized that some members required
large volumes of water, and to accommodate these individuals (known in
the family as 'water dogs'), a number of extra wells had been dug on the
family farm. Neuro 2A cells stably transfected with the mutant AVP-NP
construct showed increased rates of apoptosis as assessed by flow
cytometric methods. These observations supported the concept that
cellular toxicity of abnormal AVP-NP gene products underlies the
development of ADNDI, and the data further demonstrated that mutations
affecting the AVP moiety can result in initiation of these pathologic
processes.

612314	TITLE *612314 GLUTATHIONE S-TRANSFERASE, OMEGA-2; GSTO2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The omega class glutathione transferases (GST; EC 2.5.1.18) have poor
activity with common GST substrates, but exhibit novel
glutathione-dependent thioltransferase, dehydroascorbate reductase, and
monomethylarsonate reductase activities, and they modulate Ca(2+)
release by ryanodine receptors (e.g., RYR1, 180901) (Whitbread et al.,
2003).

For background information on GSTs, see 605482.

CLONING

By sequencing a chromosome 10 BAC contig containing the GSTO1 gene
(605482), Whitbread et al. (2003) identified GSTO2. The deduced
243-amino acid protein shares 64% identity with GSTO1. Northern blot
analysis detected a 2-kb GSTO2 transcript highly expressed in testis,
and a 1.26-kb GSTO2 transcript highly expressed in liver, kidney, and
skeletal muscle, with lower expression in heart and reproductive
tissues, predominantly testis, cervix, ovary, and prostate.

GENE STRUCTURE

Whitbread et al. (2003) determined that the GSTO2 gene contains 6 exons
and spans 24.5 kb.

MAPPING

By sequencing an unordered chromosome 10 contig containing GSTO1,
Whitbread et al. (2003) mapped the GSTO2 gene to chromosome 10q24-q25,
about 7.5-kb downstream of the GSTO1 gene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By PCR of an existing cDNA clone and by PCR of a testis cDNA library,
Whitbread et al. (2003) identified a GSTO2 polymorphism: a 424A-C
transition resulting in an asn142-to-asp (N142D) substitution.

600435	TITLE *600435 CARDIOTROPHIN 1; CTF1
;;CT1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Heart failure is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. A hallmark of
the disease is dilated cardiac hypertrophy, which is accompanied by a
reactivation of genes expressed in fetal heart development. Reasoning
that fetal or embryonic growth factors may mediate the onset of cardiac
hypertrophy, Pennica et al. (1995) coupled expression cloning with an
embryonic stem cell-based model of cardiogenesis to isolate a 21.5-kD
protein, cardiotrophin-1, that potently induces cardiac myocyte
hypertrophy in vitro. Amino acid similarity data indicated that CT1 is a
member of the family of cytokines that includes leukemia inhibitory
factor (LIF; 159540), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF; 118945),
oncostatin M (OSM; 165095), interleukin-6 (IL6; 147620), and
interleukin-11 (IL11; 147681). Several members of this family that are
known to signal through the transmembrane protein gp130 (IL6ST; 600694)
stimulate cardiac myocyte hypertrophy, like cardiotrophin-1, suggesting
that the gp130 signaling pathway may play a role in cardiac hypertrophy.
The 1.4-kb CT1 mRNA is present in the heart and several other mouse
tissues.

By screening a heart cDNA library with a mouse Ct1 probe, Pennica et al.
(1996) isolated a cDNA encoding human CTF1. The deduced CTF1 protein
contains 201 amino acids and shares 80% amino acid identity with the
203-amino acid mouse Ct1 sequence; however, unlike the mouse protein,
CTF1 has 2 rather than 1 cys and has no N-glycosylation site. Although
other gp130-signaling cytokines have similar structures with 4 alpha
helices, they share only 14 to 23% identity with CTF1. Despite lacking a
signal sequence, secreted CTF1 and mouse Ct1 induce cardiac myocyte
hypertrophy in cell culture and bind to both mouse and human LIFR
(151443) but not to OSMR (601743). Northern blot analysis detected a
1.7-kb CTF1 transcript at high levels in heart, skeletal muscle,
prostate, and ovary. Low levels were detected in lung, kidney, pancreas,
thymus, testis, and small intestine, with little or no expression
detected in brain, placenta, spleen, colon, and peripheral blood
leukocytes. Pennica et al. (1996) also observed strong expression in
fetal lung and kidney.

GENE STRUCTURE

Pennica et al. (1996) determined by genomic analysis that the CTF1 gene
contains 3 exons and spans over 6 to 7 kb.

GENE FUNCTION

Using in situ hybridization and RT-PCR, Pennica et al. (1996) detected
mouse Ctf1 expression in embryonic limb bud at high levels during
motoneuron death and markedly reduced after the period of motoneuron
cell death. Pennica et al. (1996) concluded that Ctf1 expression is
consistent with a role for Ctf1 in regulating motoneuron numbers during
development. Western blot analysis demonstrated that myotubes in culture
secrete a Ctf1 gene product with an apparent molecular weight of 30 kD.

Using a purified motoneuron culture system, Pennica et al. (1996)
demonstrated that Ctf1 is a potent long-term survival factor for a
fraction of motoneurons similar to those kept alive in culture by CNTF
or LIF. The authors also demonstrated that Ctf1 keeps lesioned
motoneurons alive in vivo after neonatal axotomy. They observed a
reduction in Ctf1-dependent motoneuron survival in culture upon
treatment with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (see
600220). Because phospholipase C can specifically cleave the GPI linkage
that attaches certain molecules to the cell surface, Pennica et al.
(1996) hypothesized that the Ctf1 receptor, like the CNTFR (118946), has
an essential GPI-linked component. Several methods were unable to detect
binding of Ctf1 to GPI-linked CNTFR alpha-subunit and hypothesized that
the GPI-linked component of the Ctf1 receptor complex on motoneurons may
therefore be a novel cytokine receptor subunit. Pennica et al. (1996)
hypothesized that Ctf1 may be important in normal motoneuron development
and as a potential tool for slowing motoneuron degeneration in human
diseases.

Development of the cerebral cortex is achieved through a common pool of
precursor cells that sequentially generate neurons and glial cells.
Barnabe-Heider et al. (2005) demonstrated that murine cortical neurons
synthesized and secreted cardiotrophin-1, which acted as gliotrophic
factor and activated the gp130-JAK (147795)-STAT (102582) pathway.
Secretion of Ctf1 was essential for the timed genesis of astrocytes as
shown in vitro and in vivo. The findings described a neural feedback
mechanism ensuring that gliogenesis does not occur until neurogenesis is
largely complete.

MAPPING

By FISH and radiation hybrid analysis, Pennica et al. (1996) mapped the
CTF1 gene to 16p11.2-p11.1, a location distinct from other IL6 cytokine
family members.

Derouet et al. (2004) determined that the mouse Ctf1 gene maps to
chromosome 7F3 in tandem with the neuropoietin gene (Np). The authors
suggested that Ctf1 and Np arose from a gene duplication event. In
human, NP has evolved into a pseudogene.

ANIMAL MODEL

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS; 105400) is a mainly sporadic
neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of cortical and spinal
motoneurons. Some familial ALS (FALS) cases have been linked to dominant
mutations in the gene encoding Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1;
147450). Transgenic mice overexpressing a mutated form of human SOD1
with a gly93-to-ala substitution (147450.0008) develop progressive
muscle wasting and paralysis as a result of spinal motoneuron loss and
die at 5 to 6 months. Bordet et al. (2001) investigated the effects of
neurotrophic factor gene delivery in this FALS model. Intramuscular
injection of an adenoviral vector encoding CTF1 in SOD1(G93A) newborn
mice delayed the onset of motor impairment as assessed in the rotarod
test. By CTF1 treatment, axonal degeneration was slowed, skeletal muscle
atrophy was largely reduced, and the time-course of motor impairment was
significantly decreased.

Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA1; 253300) is an autosomal recessive
disorder characterized by degeneration of lower motor neurons caused by
mutations of the survival motor neuron gene (SMN1; 600354).
Conditionally mutant mice homozygous for a deletion of Smn exon 7
(directed to neurons) display skeletal muscle denervation, moderate loss
of motor neuron cell bodies, and severe axonal degeneration. Lesbordes
et al. (2003) reported therapeutic benefits of systemic delivery of
CTF1. Intramuscular injection of adenoviral vector expressing CTF1, even
at very low dose, improved median survival, delayed motor defect, and
exerted a protective effect against loss of proximal motor axons and
aberrant cytoskeletal organization of motor synaptic terminals. In spite
of the severity of SMA phenotype in mutant mice, CTF1 was able to slow
disease progression.

607245	TITLE *607245 ADAPTOR-RELATED PROTEIN COMPLEX 4, BETA-1 SUBUNIT; AP4B1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The heterotetrameric adaptor protein (AP) complexes sort integral
membrane proteins at various stages of the endocytic and secretory
pathways. AP4 is composed of 2 large chains, beta-4 (AP4B1) and
epsilon-4 (AP4E1; 607244), a medium chain, mu-4 (AP4M1; 602296), and a
small chain, sigma-4 (AP4S1; 607243).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for homologs of the beta subunits of AP
complexes, followed by 5-prime RACE of a skeletal muscle cDNA library,
Dell'Angelica et al. (1999) obtained a full-length cDNA encoding AP4B1.
The deduced 739-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of
about 83 kD and contains an N-terminal 'trunk' region, a
solvent-accessible random coil 'hinge' region, and a C-terminal 'ear'
domain with a high alpha helix content. Homology with other beta
subunits is restricted to the N-terminal trunk region, where AP4B1
shares 28% identity with mammalian Ap1b1 (600157) and Ap2b1 (601025) and
21% identity with human AP3B1 (603401) and AP3B2 (602166). Northern blot
analysis revealed ubiquitous expression of a 2.5-kb transcript; a minor
6-kb species was detected in some tissues. Western blot analysis of HeLa
cell lysates confirmed an apparent molecular mass of 83 kD, and
fractionation studies revealed that it can partition as both a cytosolic
and a membrane protein. The membrane portion could be partially
extracted with high salt, indicating that AP4B1 is a peripheral membrane
protein. Gel filtration of human fibroblast cytosol revealed that AP4B1
is part of a 280-kD complex containing other proteins of 140, 50, and 17
kD. Western blot analysis identified these proteins as AP4E1, AP4M1, and
AP4S1, respectively. Immunolocalization of AP4B1 in HeLa cells indicated
that the AP4 complex associates with the trans-Golgi network or an
adjacent structure. This association was sensitive to brefeldin-A
treatment, indicating that the membrane localization of AP4 is dependent
upon the small GTP-binding protein ARF1 (103180).

By searching an EST database and screening a brain cDNA library, Hirst
et al. (1999) isolated a cDNA encoding AP4B1. The predicted AP4B1
protein contains several motifs shared with other AP beta subunits,
including a WIIGEY motif at amino acid 500 and a KKLVYLY motif near the
N terminus. They noted that AP4B1 is smaller that AP1B1, AP2B1, and
AP3B1 and appears to be missing most of the C-terminal hinge and/or ear
domain. By coimmunoprecipitation and yeast 2-hybrid analysis, the
authors confirmed that AP4B1 interacts with AP4E1 and AP4M1.

Abou Jamra et al. (2011) found ubiquitous AP4B1 expression in all fetal
and adult brain structures examined.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Consortium mapped the AP4B1 gene to
chromosome 1 (TMAP W87476).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By linkage analysis followed by candidate gene sequencing of a
consanguineous Israeli Arab family with autosomal recessive mental
retardation and spasticity (SPG47; 614066), Abou Jamra et al. (2011)
identified a homozygous truncating mutation in the AP4B1 gene
(607245.0001). The authors concluded that AP4-complex-mediated vesicular
trafficking plays a crucial role in brain development and function.

In 2 sibs, born of consanguineous Arab parents, with SPG47, Bauer et al.
(2012) identified a homozygous truncating mutation in the AP4B1 gene
(607245.0002). The mutation was found by exome sequencing of the
candidate region on chromosome 1p13-p12 identified by linkage analysis
(Blumkin et al., 2011). Bauer et al. (2012) noted the phenotypic
similarities to the patients reported by Abou Jamra et al. (2011).

By linkage analysis followed by candidate gene sequencing of a
consanguineous Israeli Arab family with autosomal recessive mental

identified a homozygous 3-bp insertion (487insTAT) in exon 5 of the
AP4B1 gene, resulting in premature protein termination. PCR analysis
showed decreased AP4B1 transcripts in patient cells compared to
controls, consistent with nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The mutation was
not found in 796 control chromosomes, including 160 Israeli Arab control
chromosomes.

identified a homozygous 1-bp deletion (664delC) in exon 5 of the AP4B1
gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination. Each
unaffected parent was heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found
in 316 Caucasian and 200 ethnically matched control chromosomes.

610434	TITLE *610434 LYMPHOCYTE ANTIGEN 6 COMPLEX, LOCUS G5C; LY6G5C
;;G5C
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

LY6G5C belongs to a cluster of leukocyte antigen-6 (LY6) genes located
in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class III region on
chromosome 6. Members of the LY6 superfamily typically contain 70 to 80
amino acids, including 8 to 10 cysteines. Most LY6 proteins are attached
to the cell surface by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor that
is directly involved in signal transduction (Mallya et al., 2002).

CLONING

By EST database searching and RT-PCR analysis, Mallya et al. (2002)
obtained LY6G5C cDNAs. The predicted protein contains an N-terminal
signal peptide, followed by a cys-rich LY6 domain. RT-PCR detected a
444-bp product in T-cell lines and fetal and adult lung. Several other
transcripts were detected, but all contained premature stop codons.

GENE STRUCTURE

Mallya et al. (2002) determined that the LY6G5C gene contains 4 exons
and spans at least 7 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Mallya et al. (2002) mapped the LY6G5C
gene to a LY6 gene cluster within the MHC class III region on chromosome
6p21.3.

609178	TITLE *609178 MIS12, S. POMBE, HOMOLOG OF; MIS12
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for sequences similar to yeast Mis12, followed by PCR of a
HeLa cell cDNA library, Goshima et al. (2003) cloned MIS12. The deduced
205-amino acid protein contains 2 conserved blocks in its N-terminal 100
amino acids, followed by a coiled-coil region of about 50 amino acids.
Endogenous HeLa cell MIS12 had an apparent molecular mass of about 25
kD. Immunolocalization showed MIS12 colocalized at kinetochores with
CENPA (117139) and CENPC (117141), and its position during the cell
cycle was that of a typical kinetochore protein. The level of MIS12 did
not fluctuate during the cell cycle.

GENE FUNCTION

Using RNA interference (RNAi) in HeLa cells, Goshima et al. (2003)
demonstrated that reduced MIS12 resulted in misaligned metaphase
chromosomes, abnormally extended metaphase spindle length, lagging
anaphase chromosomes, and interphase micronuclei without mitotic delay.
Spindle checkpoint protein MAD2 (601467) temporally localized at
kinetochores at early mitotic stages after MIS12 RNAi. Kinetochore
localization of MIS12 was unaffected by CENPA RNAi.

Following MIS12 overexpression in HeLa cells, Obuse et al. (2004)
immunoprecipitated MIS12 in a kinetochore-associated complex that
contained PMF1 (609176), DC8 (609174), C20ORF172 (609175), and HP1-alpha
(CBX5; 604478). ZWINT (609177) also associated with the complex at
kinetochores during mitosis. Immunoprecipitation of transfected cells
indicated that MIS12 could form stable complexes with C20ORF172 and DC8.
Much weaker interaction was detected between MIS12 and ZWINT. Exclusion
chromatography revealed 3 peaks containing MIS12 and C20ORF172, but only
the middle peak, which had a mass of 669 kD, contained HP1-alpha. MIS12
knockdown by RNAi abolished the kinetochore association of ZWINT, DC8,
and C20ORF172.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the MIS12
gene to chromosome 17 (TMAP SHGC-36031).

601530	TITLE *601530 SEQUESTOSOME 1; SQSTM1
;;UBIQUITIN-BINDING PROTEIN P62; P62
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The Src homology type 2 (SH2) domain is a highly conserved motif of
about 100 amino acids which mediates protein-protein interactions by
binding to phosphotyrosine. p56-lck (153390), a T-cell-specific src
family tyrosine kinase with an SH2 domain, is involved in T-cell signal
transduction. A 62-kD protein (p62) was identified by Park et al. (1995)
as a ligand of the p56-lck SH2 domain.

Joung et al. (1996) cloned the gene for p62 by purifying the p62 protein
to obtain peptide microsequences, producing a PCR product with
degenerate oligonucleotides, and then using this PCR product to screen a
HeLa cell cDNA library. Sequence analysis of full-length cDNAs by Joung
et al. (1996) revealed that the p62 gene encodes a 440-amino acid
polypeptide with the following conserved domains: (1) a cysteine-rich
domain, predicted to be a metal-binding site involved in protein-protein
or protein-DNA interaction; (2) a region with homology to the cdc42
GTPase binding-site; and (3) a PEST motif which is a degradation signal
found in many short-lived proteins. Northern blot analysis suggested
that p62 is expressed ubiquitously in all tissues examined.

Gong et al. (1999) screened a yeast 2-hybrid library made from rat
hippocampal mRNA against full-length Kv-beta-2 (601142). Two previously
unknown interacting proteins were identified, one of which was identical
to Zip (PKC-zeta (176982)-interacting protein), the rat homolog of p62.
Zip1 and Zip2, which arise from alternative splicing, are identical
except for 27 residues missing from Zip2.

GENE FUNCTION

Park et al. (1995) found that the p56-lck SH2 domain binds to p62 at the
ser59 of p62 only when that serine is phosphorylated. Moreover, Park et
al. (1995) found that p62 is associated with a serine/threonine kinase
activity and also binds to ras GTP-ase-activating protein, a negative
regulator of the ras signaling pathway.

Joung et al. (1996) expressed epitope-tagged p62 in HeLa cells and
showed that the expressed protein bound to the lck SH2 domain and that
this binding was dependent on the N-terminal 50 amino acids of p62 but
not on the tyrosine residue in this region. Thus Joung et al. (1996)
proposed that the mechanism of binding of p62 to the p56-lck SH2 domain
is by a mechanism different from the previously characterized modes of
binding of SH2 domains and their ligands.

Vadlamudi et al. (1996) used the yeast 2-hybrid system to identify
proteins that interact with p62. They isolated 46 clones that tested
positively for specific interaction with p62. Forty-three of the 46
clones were found by sequencing to be members of the ubiquitin family.
Ubiquitination of cellular proteins is a crucial feature in regulation
of signal transduction and cell cycle progression through
ubiquitination-dependent proteasomal degradation of important cellular
proteins. Vadlamudi et al. (1996) studied the interaction of p62 with
ubiquitin by in vitro binding studies which showed that p62 binds
noncovalently to ubiquitin. Vadlamudi et al. (1996) noted that p62
contains no homology with any known ubiquitin-binding protein and thus
represents a new class of ubiquitin-binding protein.

Gong et al. (1999) found that the rat Zip1 and Zip2 isoforms
differentially stimulated phosphorylation of Kv-beta-2 by PKC-zeta. Zip1
and Zip2 interacted to form heteromultimers, allowing for a hybrid
stimulatory activity to PKC-zeta. Gong et al. (1999) found that Zip1 and
Zip2 coexisted in the same cell type and were elevated differentially by
neurotrophic factors. They suggested that these results provide a
mechanism for specificity and regulation of PKC-zeta-targeted
phosphorylation.

By small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of Rab factors in a murine
macrophage line, Pilli et al. (2012) showed that inhibition of Rab8b
(613532) caused a decrease in conversion of Mycobacterium bovis BCG
phagosomes to degradative compartments after the induction of autophagy
and autophagic killing of mycobacteria. Knockdown of Rab8b-interacting
partners showed that Tbk1 (604834) was critical for autophagic killing
of BCG by suppressing the maturation of autophagosomes.
Coimmunoprecipitation, proximity ligation in situ analysis, and confocal
microscopy revealed that Tbk1 associated with Rab8b on autophagic
organelles. High-content imaging analysis showed that Tbk1 was required
in bone marrow macrophages for phosphorylation of p62 on ser403, which
was in turn required for autophagic function and clearance of p62 and
associated cargo. Further analysis revealed that Il1b was necessary for
the induction of autophagy in mycobacteria-infected macrophages and that
Tbk1 was required for Il1b-induced autophagic elimination of M.
tuberculosis.

Lee et al. (2012) showed that the atypical (i.e., nontuberculous)
mycobacterium M. abscessus (Mabc) robustly activated the NLRP3 (606416)
inflammasome in human macrophages via dectin-1 (CLEC7A; 606264)/SYK
(600085)-dependent signaling and the cytoplasmic scaffold protein
SQSTM1. Both dectin-1 and TLR2 (603028) were required for Mabc-induced
expression of IL1B (147720), CAMP (600474), and DEFB4 (DEFB4A; 602215).
Dectin-1-dependent SYK signaling, but not MYD88 (602170) signaling, led
to activation of CASP1 (147678) and secretion of IL1B through a
potassium efflux-dependent NLRP3/ASC (PYCARD; 606838) inflammasome.
Mabc-induced SQSTM1 expression was also critically involved in NLRP3
inflammasome activation. Lee et al. (2012) concluded that the NLRP3/ASC
inflammasome is critical for antimicrobial responses and innate immunity
to Mabc infection.

GENE STRUCTURE

The 2,870-nucleotide SQSTM1 transcript is contained within 8 exons
distributed over a 16-kb genomic segment (Laurin et al., 2002).

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the p62
gene to chromosome 5q35 (TMAP sts-Z40707).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using 24 French Canadian families and 112 unrelated individuals with
Paget disease of bone (602080), Laurin et al. (2002) confined the PDB3
locus (602080) on 5q35-qter to a region of approximately 300 kb. Within
this interval, 2 disease-related haplotype signatures were observed in
11 families and 18 unrelated patients. This region encoded the SQSTM1
gene, which is a candidate gene for PDB because of its association with
the RANK pathway (see 603499). Screening SQSTM1 for mutations led to the
identification of a recurrent nonconservative change (P392L;
601530.0001) flanking the ubiquitin-associated domain (UBA; position
394-440) of the protein that was not present in 291 control individuals.
The data demonstrated that 2 independent mutational events at the same
position in SQSTM1 cause Paget disease of bone in a high proportion of
French Canadian patients.

Kurihara et al. (2007) found that osteoclast precursors from PDB
patients with the P392L mutation and osteoclast precursors transduced
with p62 protein carrying the P392L mutation were hyperresponsive to
RANKL (TNFSF11; 602642) and TNF (191160) compared with control
osteoclast precursors. Mice transgenic for P392L developed increased
osteoclast numbers and progressive bone loss, but they did not manifest
the increased osteoblast numbers seen in PDB. Kurihara et al. (2007)
concluded that expression of P392L in osteoclasts is necessary to cause
predisposition to PDB, but it is not sufficient for the full PDB
phenotype.

ANIMAL MODEL

Inactivation of constitutive autophagy results in formation of
cytoplasmic protein inclusions and leads to liver injury and
neurodegeneration. Using proteomic, immunoprecipitation, and
immunofluorescence microscopy analyses, Komatsu et al. (2007) found that
p62 interacted with LC3 (MAP1LC3A; 601242) in mouse lysosomes and
autophagosomes. p62 accumulated in autophagy-deficient mouse livers and
neurons lacking Atg5 (604261) or Atg7 (608760). Mice lacking p62 were
fertile and lived more than 1 year, although they developed adult-onset
obesity and diabetes. p62 -/- Atg7 -/- double-knockout mice did not
accumulate ubiquitin protein inclusions in neurons or livers. Komatsu et
al. (2007) concluded that p62 levels are regulated by autophagy and that
the pathology of autophagy deficiency is cell type specific.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PAGET DISEASE OF BONE
SQSTM1, PRO392LEU

In 8 families showing linkage of Paget disease (602080) to the PDB3
locus on 5q, Laurin et al. (2002) used a haplotype signature strategy to
find ancestral haplotypes shared by affected individuals to narrow the
mapping interval. The SQSTM1 gene, which maps to that interval, was
found to have a C-to-T transition at position 1215 in exon 8 in all 5
affected individuals tested. This change caused the substitution of
proline-392 to a leucine (P392L). The P392L mutation was found in 18
(16%) of 112 sporadic cases and in 11 (46%) of 24 families with Paget
disease tested. Haplotype analysis by means of intragenic SNPs showed
that the P392L mutation was associated with 2 distinct haplotypes and
probably originated from 2 independent events. This mutation, occurring
at a hypermutable CpG dinucleotide, may have arisen by deamination of a
methylated cytosine.

.0002
PAGET DISEASE OF BONE
SQSTM1, 1-BP INS, 1224T

Hocking et al. (2002) identified 4 of 62 PDB (602080) families whose
affected members were heterozygous for a T insertion after base 1224 in
the SQSTM1 gene. The mutation was predicted to result in premature
termination at codon 396 in the ubiquitin-binding domain.

.0003
PAGET DISEASE OF BONE
SQSTM1, IVS7, G-A, +1

Hocking et al. (2002) identified an Australian family with PDB (602080)
whose affected members were heterozygous for a G-to-A substitution at
splice donor site IVS7+1 of the SQSTM1 gene. The mutation was predicted
to result in skipping of exon 7, which encodes part of the
ubiquitin-binding domain.

KERATIN 21, RAT, HOMOLOG OF; KRT21
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

KRT20 is an integral intermediate filament component and is a major
cytoskeletal keratin of the intestinal epithelium (Moll et al., 1990).

CLONING

Moll et al. (1990) purified KRT20, which they designated protein IT,
from human intestinal mucosa and from cytoskeletal intermediate
filaments. KRT20 has an apparent molecular mass of about 46 kD.
Antibodies raised against KRT20 decorated typical cytokeratin fibril
arrays in normal and transformed intestinal cells. Immunocytochemical
analysis of several human and rat tissues showed that KRT20 is a
prominent component of intestinal and gastric foveolar epithelium,
urothelial umbrella cells, and Merkel cells of epidermis. Sparse
positive epithelial cells were noted in the thymus, bronchus,
gallbladder, and prostate gland.

Using rat Krt21 as probe, Calnek and Quaroni (1993) obtained a partial
cDNA encoding KRT20, which they called CK20, from a colon tumor cell
line cDNA library. The partial sequence, extending from the end of
coil-1a of the alpha-helical rod domain to the polyadenylation tail
region, contains a highly conserved consensus sequence typically found
in the coil-1b alpha-helical rod domain of type I keratins. The partial
KRT20 protein shares 83% amino acid identity with the comparable
sequence of rat Krt21, which the authors renamed Ck20, or Krt20, to
reflect its homology with the human protein. The human and rat proteins
share 86% amino acid identity in the C-terminal nonhelical extension. In
situ hybridization of rat intestine detected expression of Krt20 only
after 20 days gestation (2 days before birth), when the intestinal
epithelium contained terminally differentiated epithelial cells; Krt20
was expressed with Krt8 (148060) by the entire epithelium.

GENE FUNCTION

Moll et al. (1990) found that KRT20 formed heterotypic complexes with
KRT8 in vitro, and the complexes assembled into intermediate filaments
under appropriate conditions.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Rogers et al. (2001) mapped the KRT20 gene
to the keratin gene cluster on chromosome 17q12-q21, which contains
KRT12 (601687) and several type I hair keratin genes (see 601077).

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The P518 precursor protein can be processed into several RF
(arg-phe)-amide peptides, including P518. RF-amide peptides share a
common C-terminal motif and are involved in cell signaling through G
protein-coupled receptors (Jiang et al., 2003).

CLONING

By searching a database for genes encoding RF-amide peptides, followed
by PCR of a kidney cDNA library, Jiang et al. (2003) cloned the P518
precursor gene. The deduced 126-amino acid protein contains a putative
N-terminal 22-amino acid signal peptide and no transmembrane domain,
suggesting that the protein or cleavage products can be secreted. The
26-amino acid P518 peptide sequence is located at the C terminus of the
precursor protein. Quantitative PCR detected significant expression of
P518 precursor mRNA in several specific brain regions, particularly in
cerebellum, medulla, retina, and vestibular nucleus. In peripheral
tissues, P518 precursor mRNA was detected in prostate, testis, colon,
thyroid, parathyroid, coronary artery, and bladder.

By searching for sequences similar to frog 26RFA, Chartrel et al. (2003)
identified human and rat cDNAs encoding prepro-26RFA. The deduced
136-amino acid human protein contains a 17-amino acid signal peptide,
followed by a dibasic processing site (arg-arg) and the 26RFA sequence,
which is identical to the P518 peptide sequence reported by Jiang et al.
(2003), at the C terminus. The human proprotein contains an additional
putative RF-amide peptide of 9 amino acids upstream of the 26RFA region
that is not found in rat.

By database analysis and RT-PCR of human brain RNA, Fukusumi et al.
(2003) isolated a cDNA encoding QRFP precursor protein. The 43-amino
acid QRFP peptide is located at the C terminus of the 136-amino acid
precursor protein.

Using in situ hybridization analysis in mouse brains, Takayasu et al.
(2006) demonstrated that QRFP is expressed exclusively in the
periventricular and lateral hypothalamus.

GENE FUNCTION

Jiang et al. (2003) found that the P518 peptide functioned as a
high-affinity ligand of GPR103 (606925) in GPR103-transfected human
embryonic kidney cells. The ability of P518 to mobilize intracellular
Ca(2+) via GPR103 appeared to be coupled to the G-alpha-q (GNAQ; 600998)
signaling pathway. In a human tissue RNA panel, both GPR103 and P518
precursor mRNA exhibited highest expression in brain, but their
expression in peripheral tissues was more divergent.

Chartrel et al. (2003) found that 26RFA induced a dose-dependent
stimulation of cAMP production by rat pituitary cells in vitro and
markedly increased food intake in mice.

In studies in CHO cells, Fukusumi et al. (2003) demonstrated that the
43-amino acid QRFP peptide was necessary to exhibit full agonistic
activity with GPR103. Intravenous administration of human QRFP into rats
caused release of aldosterone, suggesting that QRFP regulates adrenal
function.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the P518
precursor gene to chromosome 9 (TMAP RH48985).

ANIMAL MODEL

Takayasu et al. (2006) showed that QRFP administered centrally in mice
induced feeding behavior accompanied by increased general locomotor
activity and metabolic rate, as well as highly sustained elevations of
blood pressure and heart rate. QRFP-induced food intake was abolished by
preadministration of a specific antagonist for neuropeptide Y receptor
Y1 (162641). Hypothalamic prepro-QRFP mRNA expression was upregulated
upon fasting and in genetically obese ob/ob and db/db mice. Takayasu et
al. (2006) suggested that QRFP and GPR103 may regulate diverse
neuroendocrine and behavioral functions, and that this neuropeptide
system may be involved in metabolic syndrome (605552).

CERAMIDE GLUCOSYLTRANSFERASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

UDP-glucose ceramide glucosyltransferase (UGCG; EC 2.4.1.80) catalyzes
the first glycosylation step in glycosphingolipid (GSL) biosynthesis.
The product, glucosylceramide, is the core structure of more than 300
GSLs. GSLs are a group of membrane components that contain lipid and
sugar moieties. They are present in essentially all animal cells and are
believed to have important roles in various cellular processes (summary
by Ichikawa et al., 1996).

CLONING

Ichikawa et al. (1996) cloned a UGCG cDNA by expressing a human melanoma
cell cDNA library in a UGCG-deficient cell line and screening for UGCG
complementation. The predicted 394-amino acid UGCG protein has a
potential signal-anchor sequence and a single transmembrane domain near
the N terminus, and very hydrophobic regions close to the C terminus,
which may interact with the membrane. Northern blot analysis detected a
3.5-kb UGCG transcript in all human tissues examined.

By Western blot analysis using antibodies against GCS, or UGCG, Watanabe
et al. (1998) detected an approximately 38-kD protein in human
keratinocytes. They showed that GCS transcription is upregulated during
keratinocyte differentiation.

MAPPING

Ichikawa et al. (1997) mapped the UGCG gene to 9q31 by fluorescence in
situ hybridization. Ichikawa et al. (1998) mapped the mouse Ugcg gene to
chromosome 4B3.

;;ONCOGENE SK, CHICKEN VIRAL;;
SK ONCOGENE; SKI
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Nomura et al. (1989) isolated human cDNA clones of SKI and a SKI-related
gene, SNO (165340).

Doyle et al. (2012) performed a developmental survey of SKI expression
in wildtype mice and observed that at embryonic day 13.5, SKI protein
was robustly expressed throughout the vessel wall in the proximal
ascending aorta with less expression in the descending segment and was
localized to both the cytoplasm and nucleus. At birth, aortic expression
was somewhat reduced, and SKI was predominantly localized to the
cytoplasm. In adult mice (postnatal day 90), SKI expression was further
reduced in the medial layer of the aortic root, with exclusive
cytoplasmic localization; in the more distal ascending aorta, SKI
expression was largely absent from the central zone of the aortic media,
despite some residual expression in the intimal and adventitial layers.
Doyle et al. (2012) suggested that SKI might be predominantly required
in the very proximal aorta at early stages of development for the proper
regulation of TGF-beta signaling within the arterial media.

MAPPING

Shinagawa et al. (2001) mapped the SKI gene to chromosome 1p36.3.
Colmenares et al. (2002) confirmed the location of the gene in distal
1p36.3.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wu et al. (2002) determined the crystal structure of the SMAD4
(600993)-binding domain of SKI in complex with the MH2 domain of SMAD4
at 2.85-angstrom resolution. The structure revealed specific recognition
of the SMAD4 L3 loop region by a highly conserved interaction loop (I
loop) from SKI. The SKI-binding surface on SMAD4 was found to
significantly overlap with that required for binding of the
receptor-mediated SMADs (R-SMADs). Indeed, SKI disrupted the formation
of a functional complex between the comediator SMADs (Co-SMADs) and
R-SMADs, explaining how it could lead to repression of TGF-beta, activin
(see 147390), and bone morphogenetic protein (see 112264) responses. The
structure of the SKI fragment, stabilized by a bound zinc atom,
resembled the SAND domain found in transcription factors and other
nuclear proteins, in which the corresponding I loop is responsible for
DNA binding.

GENE FUNCTION

Transforming growth factor-beta (TGFB1; 190180) treatment of cells
induces a variety of physiologic responses, including growth inhibition,
differentiation, and induction of apoptosis. TGFB1 induces
phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of SMAD3 (603109). Sun et al.
(1999) described the association of SMAD3 with the nuclear protooncogene
protein SKI in response to the activation of TGFB1 signaling.
Association with SKI repressed transcriptional activation by SMAD3, and
overexpression of SKI rendered cells resistant to the growth-inhibitory
effects of TGFB1. The transcriptional repression as well as the growth
resistance to TGFB1 by overexpression of SKI could be overcome by
overexpression of SMAD3. These results demonstrated that SKI is a novel
component of the TGFB1 signaling pathway and shed light on the mechanism
of action of the SKI oncoprotein.

Experiments involving overexpression of Ski suggest that this gene is
involved in neural tube development and muscle differentiation (Sutrave
et al., 1990; Amaravadi et al., 1997; Kaufman et al., 2000). Ski -/-
mice display a cranial neural tube defect that results in exencephaly
and a marked reduction in skeletal muscle mass (Berk et al., 1997).
Colmenares et al. (2002) showed that the penetrance and expressivity of
the Ski -/- phenotype changes when the null mutation is backcrossed into
the C57BL6/J background, with the principal change involving a switch
from a neural tube defect to midline facial clefting. Other defects,
including depressed nasal bridge, eye abnormalities, skeletal muscle
defects, and digit abnormalities, show increased penetrance in the
C57BL6/J background. Of note, these phenotypes resemble some of the
features observed in individuals with 1p36 deletion syndrome (607872)
(Shapira et al., 1997; Slavotinek et al., 1999). These similarities
prompted Colmenares et al. (2002) to examine the chromosomal location of
human SKI and to determine whether SKI is included in the deletions of
1p36. They found that human SKI indeed is located at distal 1p36.3 and
was deleted in all of the individuals tested to that time who had the
1p36 deletion syndrome. Thus, SKI may contribute to some of the
phenotypes common in 1p36 deletion syndrome, and particularly to facial
clefting.

Shinagawa et al. (2001) also mapped the SKI gene to 1p36.3 and
determined its relationship to the p73 tumor suppressor gene (TP73;
601990) which also maps to 1p36. They showed that loss of 1 copy of
c-ski increases susceptibility to tumorigenesis in mice. When challenged
with a chemical carcinogen, c-ski heterozygous mice showed an increased
level of tumor formation relative to wildtype mice. In addition,
c-ski-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts had increased proliferative
capacity, whereas overexpression of c-ski suppressed the proliferation.

Okamoto et al. (2002) found that the SKI gene was deleted in a Japanese
girl with the 1p36 deletion syndrome with manifestations of congenital
fiber-type disproportion myopathy (CFTD; 255310) and dilated
cardiomyopathy.

Atanasoski et al. (2004) found that overexpression of human SKI in
cultured rodent Schwann cells inhibited TGFB1-mediated proliferation and
prevented growth-arrested cells from reentering the cell cycle. Ski was
upregulated in myelinating Schwann cells cocultured with dorsal root
ganglion neurons, in myelinating mouse Schwann cells in vivo, and during
remyelination after injury. Myelination was blocked in myelin-competent
cultures derived from Ski-deficient mice, and genes encoding myelin
components were downregulated in Ski-deficient nerves. Conversely,
overexpression of Ski in Schwann cells caused an upregulation of
myelin-related genes. Ski and Oct6 (602479), a transcription factor
involved in myelination, appeared to mutually regulate each other.
Atanasoski et al. (2004) concluded that expression of SKI is regulated
by axon-Schwann cell interactions and that SKI is a crucial signal in
Schwann cell development and myelination.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 10 of 12 sporadic patients with Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome (SGS;
182212), Doyle et al. (2012) identified de novo heterozygous mutations
in the SKI gene, including 8 missense mutations and one 9-bp deletion
(see, e.g., 164780.0001-164780.0005). Cultured dermal fibroblasts from
affected individuals showed enhanced activation of TGF-beta signaling
cascades and higher expression of TGF-beta-responsive genes relative to
control cells.

In 18 of 19 patients from 13 families with characteristic features of
SGS, including 5 affected individuals over 3 generations in 1 family and
another family in which 3 sibs were affected, Carmignac et al. (2012)
identified heterozygosity for 2 different in-frame deletions and 10
missense mutations in the SKI gene (see, e.g., 164780.0002, 164780.0004,
164780.0005, and 164780.0007-164780.0010). All of the mutations were
located in exon 1 of the SKI gene, within the R-SMAD-binding domain. No
SKI mutations were found in a cohort of 11 patients with other marfanoid
craniosynostosis syndromes.

ANIMAL MODEL

Doyle et al. (2012) generated zebrafish with morpholino-based knockdown
of the 2 paralogs of mammalian SKI (skia and skib), and observed mutant
embryos with marked craniofacial cartilage deficits, including shortened
and flat Meckel cartilage, irregular lengths of palatoquadrates,
shortened ceratohyales, and depleted ceratobranchial arches. These
deficits manifested in larval fish as maxillary hypoplasia, malformed
ethmoid plate, micrognathia, and microcephaly, and were frequently
accompanied by ocular hypertelorism and spinal malformation. In
addition, the skia- and skib-morphant embryos showed severe cardiac
anomalies, characterized by partial to complete failure in cardiac
looping and malformations of the outflow tract. Doyle et al. (2012)
noted that in comparison to Ski-null mice, the zebrafish morphants more
closely recapitulated the human craniofacial phenotype of
Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome.

HISTORY

Balazs et al. (1984) mapped the SK (for Sloan-Kettering) chicken viral
oncogene to 1q12-qter. By in situ hybridization, Chaganti et al. (1986)
regionalized the SKI gene to 1q22-q24.

601328	TITLE *601328 SODIUM CHANNEL, NONVOLTAGE-GATED 1, DELTA SUBUNIT; SCNN1D
;;SODIUM CHANNEL, EPITHELIAL, DELTA SUBUNIT; SCNED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Amiloride-sensitive sodium channels (ASCs) are nonvoltage-gated
sodium-permeable ion channels inhibited by the diuretic amiloride. They
are well characterized in epithelia where they constitute the
rate-limiting step for sodium ion reabsorption. Waldmann et al. (1995)
identified a novel homolog of the alpha (600228), beta (600760), and
gamma (600761) amiloride-sensitive sodium channels in the EST sequence
database and cloned the gene from a human kidney cDNA library. This
3.4-kb cDNA encodes a protein of 638 amino acids. Waldmann et al. (1995)
termed this channel the delta isoform and they determined by Northern
analysis that it is expressed mainly in ovary, testis, pancreas, and
brain. After expression in Xenopus oocytes, the delta isoform induced an
amiloride-sensitive sodium current. The current produced by the delta
isoform was increased by a factor of 100 after coexpression of the beta
subunit and gamma subunit, suggesting to Waldmann et al. (1995) that the
delta subunit is part of a novel heteromultimeric channel formed of 3
subunits with the same overall structure but no more than 27-29%
sequence identity among them. The pharmacology, sensitivity to
amiloride, conductance, and ionic selectivity of the delta/beta-gamma
channel were different from those of the alpha/beta-gamma channel.

GENE FAMILY

Molecular cloning of the epithelial amiloride-sensitive sodium channel
demonstrated that it is made up of at least 3 homologous subunits,
termed alpha, beta, and gamma, which are also homologs of the degenerins
of C. elegans, proteins considered to be probable neuronal ion channels
(Waldmann et al., 1996). Gain-of-function mutations of members of this
group of ion channels are involved in hereditary diseases. Mutations of
the C. elegans degenerins are the major known cause of neurodegeneration
in the nematode, and gain of function of the amiloride-sensitive sodium
channel beta-subunit or gamma-subunit is the cause of Liddle syndrome
(177200), a form of hereditary hypertension. The gene encoding the alpha
subunit (SCNN1A) maps to 12p13; the genes encoding the beta subunit
(SCNN1B) and gamma subunit (SCNN1G) map within a 400-kb fragment on
16p12.

MAPPING

By isotopic in situ hybridization, Waldmann et al. (1996) mapped the
gene encoding delta (SCNN1D) to 1p36.3-p36.2.

613314	TITLE *613314 RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN L37A; RPL37A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

RPL37A encodes a protein component of the large ribosomal subunit (Sim
et al., 2010).

CLONING

Saha et al. (1993) obtained a partial clone homologous to rat Rpl37a
from a human neuroblastoma cell line cDNA library, and by RT-PCR, they
obtained the full-length human RPL37A clone. The 5-prime terminus
contains a CTTTCC-like sequence characteristic of transcripts encoding
ribosomal proteins. The deduced 92-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 10.3 kD. It is highly basic and contains a putative
zinc finger domain. The human and rat transcripts share 85% nucleotide
identity, and the proteins are 100% identical. Northern blot analysis
detected RPL37A expression in normal human lymphocytes and in human
neuroblastoma and Molt4 cells. Variable Rpl37a expression was detected
in all rat tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Using RT-PCR, Sim et al. (2010) found that a subset of genes encoding
proteins of the large ribosomal subunit was differentially expressed in
nasopharyngeal carcinoma (see 607107) cell lines compared with a normal
nasopharyngeal epithelial cell line. RPL37A was 1 of 3 genes
significantly downregulated in the carcinoma cell lines.

MAPPING

Hartz (2010) mapped the RPL37A gene to chromosome 2q35 based on an
alignment of the RPL37A sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC000555) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

614003	TITLE *614003 NEUROBLASTOMA BREAKPOINT FAMILY, MEMBER 14; NBPF14
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NBPF14 is a member of the NBPF gene family, which consists of 22 genes
and pseudogenes that arose by gene duplication. NBPF genes contain
numerous low-copy repetitive elements and show high intergenic and
intragenic sequence identity in coding and noncoding regions (Vandepoele
et al., 2005).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to NBPF1 (610501),
Vandepoele et al. (2005) identified NBPF14. EST database analysis
revealed NBPF14 expression in fetal liver/spleen, prostate, uterus, and
leiomyosarcoma.

GENE STRUCTURE

Vandepoele et al. (2005) determined that the NBPF14 gene contains at
least 22 coding exons, several of which result from internal
duplication.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis and FISH, Vandepoele et al. (2005) mapped
the NBPF14 gene to an NBPF gene cluster on chromosome 1q21.1.

DESCRIPTION Yoshiura et al. (1998) identified a family in which cleft lip and palate
(119530) segregated in 2 of 3 generations with a balanced chromosomal
translocation t(2;19)(q11.2;q13.3). They identified a novel gene on
chromosome 19, which they named 'cleft lip- and palate-associated
transmembrane protein-1' (CLPTM1), by positional cloning. Assembled cDNA
sequences and comparison with genomic sequences predicted a gene with 13
exons encoding a putative protein with 7 transmembrane domains highly
conserved between human and C. elegans. Yoshiura et al. (1998) found
ubiquitous expression of a 2.6-kb transcript using Northern blot
analysis of various adult human tissues and whole-mount in situ
hybridization to day 10-12 postconception mouse embryos. Using SSCP
analysis in sporadic cases of clefting and direct sequencing of coding
sequences in familial cases, Yoshiura et al. (1998) identified no
pathologic mutations.

;;ZINC FINGER PROTEIN, SUBFAMILY 1A, MEMBER 1; ZNFN1A1;;
IKAROS; IK1;;
LYF1
IKAROS/BCL6 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Ikaros proteins are lymphoid-restricted zinc finger transcription
factors that are considered master regulators of lymphocyte
differentiation. Klug et al. (1998) noted that there are at least 8
alternatively spliced transcripts of the Ikaros gene that encode
isoforms with common N-terminal and C-terminal domains. By screening a
Jurkat T-cell cDNA library with a mouse Ikaros cDNA, Molnar et al.
(1996) isolated human Ikaros cDNAs. The deduced human and mouse Ikaros
proteins are 95% identical. RT-PCR of human thymus and peripheral blood
leukocyte mRNAs detected 6 Ikaros splicing variants which were expressed
at similar levels and ratios as the corresponding mouse leukocyte Ikaros
transcripts. The authors found that Ikaros proteins are conserved in
sequence composition and relative expression between human T cells and
mouse thymocytes. Northern blot analysis demonstrated the expression of
7.5- and 4.5-kb Ikaros transcripts in human thymus, spleen, and
peripheral blood leukocytes.

By PCR using primers based on a conserved nucleotide sequence of various
zinc finger proteins, Nietfeld and Meyerhans (1996) cloned human bone
marrow cDNAs encoding Ikaros, which they designated IK1. The deduced
519-amino acid protein is 93% identical to the mouse Ikaros isoform
1/LyF1 isoform VI and contains 4 N-terminal and 2 C-terminal zinc finger
domains. The authors detected 3 human mRNA species by Northern blot
analysis: a 4.4-kb transcript, which was prominent in peripheral blood
leukocytes; a 6.0-kb transcript, which was strongly expressed in spleen,
thymus, lymph node, and bone marrow; and a 7.0-kb transcript. They
stated that the human and mouse Ikaros genes have similar overall
transcription patterns.

Dijon et al. (2008) stated that the N-terminal Kruppel-like zinc finger
domain of Ikaros proteins is involved in DNA binding, while the
C-terminal zinc finger domain mediates homo- or heterodimerization with
other Ikaros proteins. Alternative splicing of exons 3 to 6 produces
Ikaros isoforms with 0 to 4 N-terminal zinc fingers, and those with at
least 3 efficiently bind DNA. The DNA-binding Ikaros isoforms include
IK1, IK2, IK3, and IKX, and IK4 can bind DNA on palindromic sequences.
IK5, IK6, IK7, and IK8 are considered dominant-negative isoforms due to
their capacity to bind other isoforms and their inefficiency in binding
DNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Harker et al. (2002) showed that Ikaros may play an important role in
CD4 (186940) versus CD8 (see CD8A; 186910) lineage commitment decisions
by demonstrating: (1) that it binds to regulatory elements in the
endogenous CD8A locus in vivo using thymocyte chromatin
immunoprecipitations; (2) that Ikaros suppresses position effect
variegation of transgenes driven by CD8 regulatory elements; and (3)
that mice with reduced levels of Ikaros and Aiolos (606221) show an
apparent increase in CD4 populations with immature phenotype, i.e.,
cells that fail to activate the CD8A gene. The authors proposed that
Ikaros family members function as activators of the CD8A gene and that
their associated activities are critical for appropriate chromatin
remodeling transitions during thymocyte differentiation and lineage
commitment.

Ezzat et al. (2005) demonstrated that Ikaros is expressed in the
hormone-producing pituitary corticomelanotroph cells of mice, where it
binds the proopiomelanocortin promoter and regulates endogenous gene
expression. Ikaros-null mice had contraction of the pituitary
corticomelanotroph population, reduced circulating adrenocorticotrophic
hormone levels, and adrenal glucocorticoid insufficiency. Hematopoietic
reconstitution failed to correct this hormonal deficit, but the
phenotype of reduced body weight and diminished survival was rescued by
systemic glucocorticoid-hormone administration. Ezzat et al. (2005)
concluded that Ikaros plays a role in orchestrating immune-endocrine
development and function.

Yap et al. (2005) identified Ikaros-binding elements in the 5-prime
flanking regions of pufferfish, mouse, and human STAT4 (600558).
Transactivation, electrophoretic mobility shift, and RNA interference
analyses showed that Ikaros bound to the STAT4 promoter and was involved
in regulation of STAT4 in human T cells.

Dijon et al. (2008) found that purified CD34 (142230)-positive human
cord blood cells and adult peripheral blood cells that were cultured
under erythroid conditions expressed the DNA-binding Ikaros isoforms IK1
through IK4, but not the dominant-negative isoform IK6.
Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that expression of IK6 in these
cells resulted in complex formation between IK6 and IK1, and IK6
decreased cell number and increased cell death. IK6 overexpression
disturbed erythroid differentiation and expression of erythroid-specific
genes, although it had no effect on Ikaros expression, and favored
myelopoiesis by promoting expression of myeloid-specific genes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Dijon et al. (2008) stated that the IKZF1 gene contains 7 translated
exons.

MAPPING

Using somatic cell hybrid DNAs, Molnar et al. (1996) mapped the human
Ikaros gene to 7p13-p11.1, near the EGFR gene (131550). They mapped the
mouse Ikaros gene to chromosome 11 by interspecific backcross analysis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Ikaros is required for normal lymphocyte development. Germline mutant
mice that express only non-DNA-binding dominant-negative 'leukemogenic'
Ikaros isoforms lacking critical N-terminal zinc fingers develop an
aggressive form of lymphoblastic leukemia 3 to 6 months after birth (see
'Animal Model' below). These facts prompted Sun et al. (1999) to seek
molecular abnormalities involving the Ikaros gene in acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL2; 613067) in infants. In leukemic cells from 12 ALL
infants less than 1 year of age, Sun et al. (1999) found high-level
expression of dominant-negative isoforms of Ikaros with abnormal
subcellular compartmentalization patterns. PCR cloning and nucleotide
sequencing were used to identify the specific Ikaros isoforms and detect
Ikaros gene mutations in these cells. Leukemic cells from 7 of 7 infants
with ALL, including 5 of 5 MLL-AF4-positive (159557) infants, expressed
dominant-negative Ikaros isoforms IK4, IK7, and IK8 that lack critical
N-terminal zinc fingers. In 6 of 7 patients, Sun et al. (1999) detected
an in-frame deletion of 10 amino acids (KSSMPQKFLG) upstream of the
transcription-activation domain adjacent to the C-terminal zinc fingers
of IK2, IK4, IK7, and IK8. In contrast, only wildtype IK1 and IK2
isoforms with normal nuclear localization were found in normal infant
bone marrow cells and infant thymocytes. These results implicated the
expression of dominant-negative Ikaros isoforms and the disruption of
normal Ikaros function in the leukemogenesis of ALL in infants.

Nakase et al. (2000) found overexpression of the dominant-negative IK6
isoform in 14 of 41 B-cell patients with adult B-cell ALL. None of the
other dominant-negative isoforms of the Ikaros gene were detected by
RT-PCR analysis. Southern blot analysis with PstI digestion revealed
that those patients with the dominant-negative IK6 isoform might have
small mutations in the Ikaros locus. The results suggested that Ikaros
plays a key role in human B-cell malignancies through the
dominant-negative isoform IK6.

Using RT-PCR to detect Ikaros isoforms with the 30-base deletion in exon
6, Payne et al. (2001) showed that transcripts for IK1 and IK1 with the
deletion were present in normal cord blood and bone marrow, as well as
in 3 ALL cell lines. In addition, they identified an isoform, IKX, that
was identical to IK3 except that it included exon 6; IKX was generated
from a novel exon combination with and without the 30-base deletion.
Payne et al. (2001) detected multiple DNA-binding and nonbinding
isoforms with a 60-base insertion linked to leukemia expressed at the
RNA level in normal hemopoietic cells. Immunoblot analysis indicated
that the predominant isoform in normal cells is IKX, while the
predominant form in leukemic cells is IK1.

In a genomewide analysis of leukemic cells from 242 pediatric ALL
patients using high resolution, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
arrays and genomic DNA sequencing, Mullighan et al. (2007) identified
mutations in genes encoding principal regulators of B-lymphocyte
development and differentiation in 40% of B-progenitor ALL cases.
Deletions were detected in IKZF1, IKZF3 (606221),TCF3 (147141), EBF1
(164343), and LEF1 (153245). The PAX5 (167414) gene was the most
frequent target of somatic mutation, being altered in 31.7% of cases.

The Philadelphia chromosome, a chromosomal abnormality that encodes
BCR-ABL1 (see 151410, 189980), is the defining lesion of chronic
myelogenous leukemia (CML) and a subset of acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(ALL). To define oncogenic lesions that cooperate with BCR-ABL1 to
induce ALL, Mullighan et al. (2008) performed a genomewide analysis of
diagnostic leukemia samples from 304 individuals with ALL, including 43
BCR-ABL1 B-progenitor ALLs and 23 CML cases. IKZF1, encoding the
transcription factor Ikaros, was deleted in 83.7% of BCR-ABL1 ALL, but
not in chronic phase CML. Deletion of IKZF1 was also identified as an
acquired lesion at the time of transformation of CML to ALL (lymphoid
blast crisis). The IKZF1 deletions resulted in haploinsufficiency,
expression of a dominant-negative Ikaros isoform, or the complete loss
of Ikaros expression. Sequencing of IKZF1 deletion breakpoints suggested
that aberrant RAG-mediated recombination (see 179615) is responsible for
the deletions. Mullighan et al. (2008) concluded that genetic lesions
resulting in the loss of Ikaros function are an important event in the
development of BCR-ABL1 ALL.

Mullighan et al. (2009) identified deletions involving the IKZF1 gene in
leukemic cells of 63 (28.6%) of 221 children with B-cell acute
lymphoblastic leukemia. Cells from 20 patients had a deletion of coding
exons 3 through 6, resulting in the expression of a dominant-negative
form of IKZF1. IKZF1 deletions were associated with an increased risk of
relapse and adverse effects in the original cohort and in an independent
cohort of 258 patients (p values ranging from less than 0.001 to 0.004).

For a discussion of a possible association between variation in the
IKZF1 gene and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, see ALL2 (613067).

CYTOGENETICS

The BCL6 gene (109565), isolated from the breakpoints of 3q27-associated
chromosomal translocations, is implicated in diffuse large B-cell
lymphomas (DLBL). Hosokawa et al. (2000) described the molecular
characterization of novel t(3;7)(q27;p12) translocations in 2 patients
with DLBL. Molecular genetic analysis of the breakpoint area involving
BCL6 revealed the presence of the Ikaros gene. As a molecular
consequence of the translocation, the 5-prime regulatory region of BCL6
was replaced by the putative 5-prime regulatory region of the Ikaros
gene, probably leading to deregulated expression of the BCL6 gene
throughout B-cell differentiation. RT-PCR and FISH analyses of a patient
sample established that the translocation resulted in fusion of the
Ikaros and BCL6 genes. The clinical features of the 2 patients with DLBL
and t(3;7)(q27;p12) translocations were reported by Ichinohasama et al.
(1998).

ANIMAL MODEL

Mice homozygous for a germline mutation in the Ikaros DNA-binding domain
lack not only T and B lymphocytes and natural killer cells, but also
their earliest defined progenitors (Georgopoulos et al., 1994). In
contrast, the erythroid and myeloid lineages are intact in these mutant
mice. Klug et al. (1998) showed that the DNA-binding isoforms of mouse
Ikaros are localized in the nucleus of the most primitive hematopoietic
stem cell subset. They found that Ikaros localizes to heterochromatin in
Abelson-transformed pre-B lymphocytes. Changes in the RNA splicing
pattern of Ikaros occurred at 2 stages of lymphoid differentiation.

O'Neill et al. (1999, 2000) described the structure of a chromatin
remodeling complex associated with Ikaros that is present only in adult
hematopoietic cells. This complex binds to Ikaros-like DNA-binding
sites, including a long polypyrimidine-rich sequence upstream of the
human delta-globin gene (142000), and was thus called PYR complex.
Deletion of this sequence in a human beta locus-containing cosmid
(carrying sequences from the human gamma-A gene, 142200, through the
adult beta-globin gene, 141900) in transgenic mice resulted in delayed
switching from gamma-globin to beta-globin. Lopez et al. (2002) showed
that homozygous Ikaros-null mice lacked the PYR complex, demonstrating a
requirement for Ikaros in the formation of the complex on DNA.
Heterozygous Ikaros-null mice had about half as much PYR complex,
indicating a dosage effect for both Ikaros and PYR complex. They also
showed that Ikaros-null mice had multiple hematopoietic cell defects,
including anemia and megakaryocytic abnormalities, in addition to
lymphoid and stem cell defects. The null mice also had a delay in murine
embryonic-to-adult beta-globin switching and a delay in human
gamma-to-beta switching, consistent with the suggested role for PYR
complex in this process. Lastly, cDNA array analyses indicated that
several hematopoietic cell-specific genes in all blood lineages were
either up- or downregulated in 14-day embryos from Ikaros-null mice
compared with wildtype mice. These results indicated that Ikaros and PYR
complex function together in vivo at many adult hematopoietic
cell-specific genes and at intergenic sites, affecting their expression
and leading to pleiotropic hematopoietic defects.

Plasmacytoid dendritic cells are specialized dendritic cells that
produce high levels of type I interferon (see IFNA1; 147660) upon viral
infection. Allman et al. (2006) showed that mice expressing low levels
of Ikaros lacked peripheral plasmacytoid dendritic cells but not other
dendritic cell subsets. Loss of plasmacytoid dendritic cells was
associated with inability to produce type I interferon after challenge
with Tlr7 (300365) or Tlr9 (605474) ligands or murine cytomegalovirus.
Conventional dendritic cells were present in normal numbers and
exhibited normal responses to in vivo challenge with murine
cytomegalovirus or inactivated toxoplasma antigen.
