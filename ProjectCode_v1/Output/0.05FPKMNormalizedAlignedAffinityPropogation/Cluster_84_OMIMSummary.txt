DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ARHGEF9 gene encodes collybistin, a brain-specific guanine
nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that belongs to a family of Rho-like
GTPases that act as molecular switches by cycling from the active
GTP-bound state to the inactive GDP-bound state. Collybistin has a
pivotal role in the formation of postsynaptic glycine and inhibitory
gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor clusters (summary by Shimojima et al.,
2011).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Ishikawa et al. (1997) cloned ARHGEF9, which they designated
KIAA0424. The deduced 516-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of about 58 kD. ARHGEF9 shares 22% identity with the DBL oncogene
(311030).

Reid et al. (1999) further characterized ARHGEF9, which they called
PEM2. ARHGEF9 contains an N-terminal SRC homology 3 (SH3) domain,
followed by tandem DBL homology (DH) and pleckstrin homology (PH)
domains and a C-terminal proline-rich sequence. Northern blot analysis
detected a transcript of about 6 kb expressed almost exclusively in
brain. ARHGEF9, expressed in COS-7 cells, showed an apparent molecular
mass of about 70 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

By biochemical analysis of ARHGEF9 expressed in COS-7 cells, Reid et al.
(1999) found the ARHGEF9 specifically activates CDC42 (116952) and not
Rac (602048) or RhoA (165390). Ectopic expression in mouse fibroblasts
revealed a Cdc42 phenotype featuring filopodia formation, followed by
cortical actin polymerization and cell rounding.

Using in vitro pull-down assays and yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Grosskreutz
et al. (2001) found that polar amino acids between the SH3 and DH
domains of rat Arhgef9, which they called collybistin, interacted with
gephyrin (603930). In vitro, gephyrin bound simultaneously to Arhgef9
and to a glycine receptor beta subunit (138492) peptide. Grosskreutz et
al. (2001) hypothesized that ARHGEF9-gephyrin interactions occur during
inhibitory postsynaptic membrane formation.

Harvey et al. (2004) characterized several new variants of collybistin,
which are created by alternative splicing of exons encoding an
N-terminal src homology-3 (SH3) domain and 3 alternate C termini (CB1,
CB2, and CB3). They localized the binding sites for collybistin and the
beta subunit of the glycine receptor (GLRE; 138492) to the C-terminal
MoeA homology domain of gephyrin (GPHN; 603930) and showed that
multimerization of this domain is required for collybistin-gephyrin and
GlyR-gephyrin interactions. They also demonstrated that gephyrin
clustering in recombinant systems and cultured neurons requires both
collybistin-gephyrin interactions and an intact collybistin pleckstrin
homology domain.

GENE STRUCTURE

Harvey et al. (2004) determined that the ARHGEF9 gene consists of 10
exons distributed over approximately 190 kb.

Shimojima et al. (2011) stated that the ARHGEF9 gene contains 11 exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1997) mapped the ARHGEF9
gene to the X chromosome. By genomic sequence analysis, Reid et al.
(1999) mapped the ARHGEF9 gene to a position 145 cR from the top of
chromosome X.

Harvey et al. (2004) stated that the ARHGEF9 gene maps to chromosome
Xq22.1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The vital importance of collybistin for inhibitory synaptogenesis was
underlined by the discovery by Harvey et al. (2004) of a mutation (G55A;
300429.0001) in exon 2 of the ARHGEF9 gene in a patient with clinical
symptoms of both hyperekplexia and early infantile epileptic
encephalopathy (EIEE8; 300607). Harvey et al. (2004) suggested that the
clinical manifestations of this ARHGEF9 missense mutation may result, at
least in part, from mislocalization of gephyrin and a major GABA(A)
receptor subtype.

In 1 of 23 boys with mental retardation, Shimojima et al. (2011)
identified a loss-of-function mutation in the ARHGEF9 gene (Q2X;
300429.0002). The patient had refractory seizures, right frontal
polymicrogyria, and severe psychomotor retardation.

CYTOGENETICS

Marco et al. (2008) reported a girl with mental retardation and sensory
hyperarousal associated with a balanced de novo paracentric inversion
(X)(q11.1;q27.3) that disrupted 1 allele of the ARHGEF9 gene between
exons 1 and 3. At age 18 months, she showed hyperarousal to noise and
social situations as well as global developmental delay. The
hyperarousal severely limited her activities and family life. As a teen,
other features included slightly dysarthric speech, difficulty with
smooth eye pursuit, mild bilateral lower extremity spasticity with brisk
reflexes and extensor plantar responses, and wide-based gait. Laboratory
studies showed completely skewed X inactivation in favor of the abnormal
X chromosome and decreased ARHGEF9 mRNA at 9% of control levels.

Shimojima et al. (2011) reported a 5-year-old boy with severely delayed
psychomotor development and seizures who had a de novo 737-kb deletion
of Xq11.1 including the ARHGEF9, SPIN4, and LOC92249 genes. His seizures
began at age 2 years, were well-controlled, and were of complex-partial
type. EEG showed separate spikes at the temporal regions. He also showed
generalized overgrowth and trigonocephaly, but no other dysmorphic
features.

Lesca et al. (2011) reported a 6-year-old boy with profound mental
retardation associated with a de novo 1.29-Mb deletion of Xq11.11
including the ARHGEF9 gene. He showed delayed psychomotor development in
infancy and presented at age 5 months with episodes of neurologic
distress, including loss of consciousness, hypotonia, cyanosis, and
turning of the head. The seizures were controlled, but worsened after
withdrawal of treatment at age 4 years, at which point he developed
nocturnal seizures with secondary generalization. At age 6, he showed
generalized overgrowth (weight, height, and head circumference all +3
SD), and had mild dysmorphic features, including pectus excavatum,
enlarged ear lobes, prominent nasal bridge, and small mouth with
prognathia. He had hyperactivity with attention deficit and limited
social interaction, but had no intolerance of loud noises and no
hyperarousal. Array CGH analysis identified a deletion including the
ARHGEF9, SPIN4, and LOC92249 genes, as well as 3 putative gene
sequences.

ANIMAL MODEL

Papadopoulos et al. (2007) found that Arhgef9-null mice had brain
region-specific loss of postsynaptic gephyrin clusters in the
hippocampus, the basolateral amygdala, parts of the thalamus, and the
cerebellum, although the overall expression levels of synaptic proteins
in the central nervous system were similar to wildtype. These findings
suggested a redistribution of postsynaptic proteins. Mutant mice also
had decreased postsynaptic levels of the GABA receptor subunit GABRG2
(137164) in the basolateral amygdala and hippocampus compared to
wildtype, and this was associated with decreased GABAergic transmission
and changes in synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Mutant mice
showed increased anxiety and impaired spatial learning, but no changes
in locomotor behavior. Specifically, mutant mice did not exhibit tremor
or altered gait compared to wildtype mice. There was no effect on the
localization of glycine receptors.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
EPILEPTIC ENCEPHALOPATHY, EARLY INFANTILE, 8
ARHGEF9, GLY55ALA

In a child with clinical features of both hyperekplexia and early
infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE8; 300607), Harvey et al. (2004)
demonstrated a gly55-to-ala (G55A) mutation that arose from a 164G-C
transversion in exon 2 of the ARHGEF9 gene. The conserved gly55 residue
is within the SH3 domain, and transfection studies in HEK293 cells
suggested that the G55A mutation disrupts SH3 domain structure and
function.

.0002
EPILEPTIC ENCEPHALOPATHY, EARLY INFANTILE, 8
ARHGEF9, GLN2TER

In a boy with early infantile encephalopathy-8 (300670), Shimojima et
al. (2011) identified a 4C-T transition in exon 1a of the ARHGEF9 gene,
resulting in a gln2-to-ter (Q2X) substitution. The mutation only affects
transcript variant 2, which is normally expressed in human fetal and
adult brain. His unaffected mother was heterozygous for the mutation,
which was not found in 100 control DNA samples. The patient had
psychomotor delay beginning in early infancy. He developed intractable
seizures at age 20 months, and EEG showed continuous spike and wave
patterns during sleep. Brain MRI showed right frontal polymicrogyria. At
age 5 years and 5 months, he had severe developmental delay, could not
speak, and was ataxic. Shimojima et al. (2011) postulated a
loss-of-function effect of the mutation.

;;GTP-SPECIFIC SUCCINYL-CoA SYNTHETASE, BETA SUBUNIT;;
G-BETA
DESCRIPTION Succinyl-CoA synthetase (SCS) is composed of an invariant alpha subunit
and a beta subunit that determines whether the enzyme is GTP-specific
(G-SCS; EC 6.2.1.4) or ATP-specific (A-SCS; EC 6.2.1.5). See SUCLA2
(603921). Johnson et al. (1998) identified human and mouse cDNAs
encoding A-beta and G-beta, the beta subunits of A-SCS and G-SCS,
respectively. The predicted 395-amino acid human G-beta protein shares
89 to 94% identity with that of pigeon, mouse, and pig, and 38 to 48%
identity with the beta subunit of bacterial SCSs. Human A-beta and
G-beta are 53% identical. RT-PCR revealed that G-beta is widely
expressed. Although the level of G-beta mRNA appears to be lower than
that of A-beta in most human and mouse tissues, Johnson et al. (1998)
demonstrated that G-SCS was generally the predominant enzyme activity in
rat and mouse tissues.

;;VACUOLAR PROTEIN SORTING 22, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; VPS22;;
ELL-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN, 30-KD; EAP30
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SNF8, VPS25 (610907), and VPS36 (610903) form ESCRT-II (endosomal
sorting complex required for transport II), a complex involved in
endocytosis of ubiquitinated membrane proteins. SNF8, VPS25, and VPS36
are also associated in a multiprotein complex with RNA polymerase II
elongation factor (ELL; 600284) (Slagsvold et al., 2005; Kamura et al.,
2001).

CLONING

Schmidt et al. (1999) purified the Ell-containing complex from rat liver
extracts, and by peptide sequencing and EST database analysis, they
obtained a full-length cDNA encoding SNF8, which they called EAP30. The
deduced protein contains 258 amino acids.

GENE FUNCTION

Schmidt et al. (1999) found that recombinant EAP30 could interact with
recombinant ELL in vitro and derepress the inhibitory activity of ELL
against RNA polymerase II (see 180660).

Using mouse proteins expressed in mammalian and insect cells, Kamura et
al. (2001) found that Eap30 and Eap20 (VPS25) could be
coimmunoprecipitated in the absence of Eap45 (VPS36), and that Eap20 and
Eap45 could be coimmunoprecipitated in the absence of Eap30. However,
little Eap30 was coimmunoprecipitated with Eap45 in the absence of
Eap20. Kamura et al. (2001) concluded that EAP20 bridges EAP30 and EAP45
and thereby nucleates assembly of the EAP complex.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SNF8
gene to chromosome 17 (TMAP D17S1827).

;;AZ1, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; AZ1;;
KIAA1118
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human adult brain
cDNA library, Kikuno et al. (1999) cloned AZI1, which they designated
KIAA1118. The deduced 1,165-amino acid protein shares a high degree of
similarity with the mouse Azi1 protein and with the troponin family (see
191041). RT-PCR ELISA detected highest AZI1 expression in spinal cord,
followed by testis, ovary, amygdala, cerebellum, and thalamus. Lower
expression was detected in all other adult and fetal tissues and
specific adult brain regions examined.

Aoto et al. (1995) cloned mouse Az1 from a testis cDNA library. The
deduced 947-amino acid protein has 2 proline-rich regions in its
N-terminal half, 5 potential N-glycosylation sites, and several putative
nuclear targeting sequences. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.7-kb
transcript in all mouse tissues examined, with highest expression in
testis, followed by ovary, brain, and adipose tissue. In mouse testis,
expression began in pachytene spermatocytes beginning at 16 days of age,
when meiosis occurs. Testis of jsd/jsd mice, in which germ cells are
arrested in an early stage of spermatogenesis, did not express Az1.
Immunohistochemical analysis revealed Az1 expression in the preacrosome
region of round and elongated spermatids in seminiferous tubules, but
not in more differentiated spermatids.

GENE FUNCTION

Aoto et al. (1995) found that the expression of Az1 was induced by
5-azacytidine, a potent inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase (see 126375)
that causes differentiation of C3H10T1/2 mouse mesenchymal cells into
chondrocytes, adipocytes, and myotubes, or induces transformation.

MAPPING

By analyzing a human-rodent hybrid panel, Kikuno et al. (1999) mapped
the AZI1 gene to chromosome 17. Gross (2011) mapped the AZI1 gene to
chromosome 17q25.3 based on an alignment of the AZI1 sequence (GenBank
GENBANK BC136578) with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;COMPARATIVE GENE IDENTIFICATION 58; CGI58;;
NCIE2 GENE; NCIE2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ABHD5 functions as an acyltransferase for the synthesis of phosphatidic
acid, the major intermediate in membrane and storage lipid biosynthesis.
It also functions as a coactivator of adipocyte triglyceride lipase
(ATGL, or PNPLA2; 609059) (Ghosh et al., 2008).

CLONING

By examining the critical region for Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome (CDS;
275630), a rare autosomal recessive form of NCIE (see 242300), on
chromosome 3p21, Lefevre et al. (2001) identified several candidate
genes, one of which, designated CGI58, was identified by Lai et al.
(2000) as having homology to a protein from C. elegans. Lefevre et al.
(2001) determined that CGI58 encodes a 349-amino acid protein of
approximately 39 kD that has strong homology with several members of a
large family defined by an alpha/beta hydrolase fold. CGI58 contains 3
sequence motifs that correspond to a catalytic triad found in the
esterase/lipase/thioesterase subfamily but differs in that its putative
catalytic triad contains an asparagine in place of the usual serine
residue. Database analysis showed wide expression of CGI58 in various
tissues, including skin, lymphocytes, liver, skeletal muscle, and brain.
Database analysis also revealed conservation of CGI58 from bacteria to
human.

Ghosh et al. (2008) noted that human CGI58 contains esterase,
hydrolase/acyltransferase, and lysophospholipase domains.

Using Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses of differentiated
mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes, Yamaguchi et al. (2004) detected Cgi58
predominantly at the surface of lipid droplets, where it colocalized
with perilipin (PLIN1; 170290) and Adrp (PLIN2; 103195). Some Cgi58 was
also detected in the cytosol of differentiated adipocytes, but it was
not detected prior to differentiation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lefevre et al. (2001) determined that the ABHD5 gene contains 7 exons.

MAPPING

Lefevre et al. (2001) identified the ABHD5 gene in the critical region
for Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome on chromosome 3p21.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid and protein pull-down assays, Yamaguchi et al. (2004)
found that rat Cgi58 bound directly to mouse perilipin and Adrp.

Ghosh et al. (2008) found that purified recombinant human CGI58 had
acyltransferase activity and converted lysophosphatidic acid to
phosphatidic acid using palmitoyl-CoA or oleoyl-CoA as acyl donors.
CGI58 did not use any other lysophospholipid as acyl acceptor; rather,
its activity was inhibited by all other lysophospholipids or
phospholipids examined, predominantly lysophosphatidylcholine.
Biochemical and Western blot analyses of mouse white adipose tissue
suggested that Cgi58 functions in the cytosol as well as on lipid
droplets. Expression of human CGI58 complemented the metabolic defect in
yeast lacking the acyltransferase Ict1. Overexpression of CGI58 in yeast
increased the amount of all major phospholipids examined and reduced the
amount of triacylglycerol. The CGI58 mutations gln130 to pro (Q130P;
604780.0004) and glu260 to lys (E260K; 604780.0007), which eliminate the
ability of CGI58 to activate ATGL, had no effect on CGI58
acyltransferase activity. Ghosh et al. (2008) concluded that CGI58 has
independent ATGL coactivation and acyltransferase activities.

Using a cell culture model and various biochemical approaches, Wang et
al. (2011) investigated the mechanisms by which PLIN1, PLIN2, and PLIN5
(613248) control lipolysis by ATGL and its colipase, CGI58. PLIN5
exerted a negative regulatory role in lipid droplet hydrolysis by
binding and inhibiting ATGL activity at the lipid droplet surface under
basal conditions. Even after protein kinase A (PKA; see 188830)
activation, release of fatty acid was only modestly increased. In
contrast, recruitment of CGI58, followed by interaction with ATGL,
increased lipolysis. Neither PLIN1 nor PLIN2 directly interacted with
ATGL. Wang et al. (2011) proposed that PLIN5 plays a critical role in
oxidative tissues (e.g., heart and skeletal muscle) to protect
mitochondria from a rapid increase of fatty acid during lipolysis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 9 families from the Mediterranean basin segregating Chanarin-Dorfman
syndrome (275630), Lefevre et al. (2001) identified 8 different
haplotypes and homozygous mutations in the ABHD5 gene
(604780.0001-604780.0008).

ANIMAL MODEL

Radner et al. (2010) obtained Cgi58 -/- mice at the expected mendelian
frequency, but they died within 16 hours after birth. Cgi58 -/- newborns
were smaller and weighed less than wildtype littermates, and they showed
abnormally low plasma lipid and glucose levels, ectopic lipid
accumulation, granulocyte vacuolization, and hepatic steatosis. Cgi58
-/- epidermis exhibited characteristics of lamellar ichthyosis with
impaired barrier function. Isolated fibroblasts from Cgi58 -/- embryos
showed excessive lipid storage due to impaired activation of
Atgl-mediated triglyceride hydrolysis. Immunohistochemical analysis of
Cgi58 -/- epidermis revealed delayed keratinocyte differentiation and
corneocyte formation. Unlike wildtype epidermis, Cgi58 -/- epidermis
transplanted onto nude mice exhibited severe growth retardation and
lacked fur development, suggesting that the skin defect in Cgi58 -/-
mice is inherent to the skin and not due to systemic Cgi58 deficiency.
Acylceramides are obligatory precursors for the covalent binding of
omega-OH-ceramides to corneocyte proteins. Characterization of the
corneal lipid envelope revealed reduced abundance of covalently bound
omega-OH-ceramides, elevated levels of free omega-OH-ceramides, and
undetectable acylceramides in Cgi58 -/- skin compared with wildtype or
Atgl -/- samples. Radiolabeled oleic acid was not released from the
triglyceride pool and was not converted to phospholipids or
acylceramides. The function of Cgi58 in skin appeared to be independent
of Atgl. Radner et al. (2010) concluded that CGI58 has a crucial role in
epidermal triglyceride catabolism for acylceramide synthesis, in
addition to its role in triglyceride homeostasis and energy catabolism.

Lefevre et al. (2001) identified a homozygous IVS3-2A-G mutation in the
acceptor splice site for exon 3 of the ABHD5 gene.

In a family from Algeria with Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome (275630),
Lefevre et al. (2001) identified a homozygous 389A-C mutation in exon 3
of the ABHD5 gene, resulting in a gln130-to-pro (Q130P) substitution.

Yamaguchi et al. (2004) found that expression of the corresponding
mutation in rat Cgi58 (Q132P) in 3 different cell lines caused
mistargeting of Cgi58 away from lipid droplets and toward a diffuse
cytoplasmic distribution. The mutant protein did not interact with
perilipin (PLIN1; 170290) or colocalize with perilipin on lipid
droplets.

ABHD5 gene, resulting in a glu260-to-lys (E260K) substitution.

Yamaguchi et al. (2004) found that expression of the corresponding
mutation in rat Cgi58 (E262K) in 3 different cell lines caused
mistargeting of Cgi58 away from lipid droplets and toward a diffuse
cytoplasmic distribution. The mutant protein did not interact with
perilipin (PLIN1; 170290) or colocalize with perilipin on lipid
droplets.

604037	TITLE *604037 RAS-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN RAB5C; RAB5C
;;RAB-LIKE, FORMERLY; RABL, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the Rab protein family are small GTPases of the Ras
superfamily that are thought to ensure fidelity in the process of
docking and/or fusion of vesicles with their correct acceptor
compartment (Han et al., 1996).

CLONING

Han et al. (1996) isolated fetal lung cDNAs encoding a RAB protein that
they designated RABL (RAB5-like). The predicted 216-amino acid RABL
protein shares 86% identity with RAB5A (179512) and RAB5B (179514) and
contains the conserved GTP-binding site characteristic of RAS proteins.
RT-PCR analysis revealed that RABL is expressed ubiquitously.

MAPPING

By analysis of cloned segments, Albertsen et al. (1994) determined that
the RAB5C gene, which they called BC1-16, is located in the BRCA1
(113705) gene region on chromosome 17q12-q21. Han et al. (1996) refined
the map position to 17q21.2 using FISH.

601627	TITLE *601627 SURVIVAL OF MOTOR NEURON 2; SMN2
;;SURVIVAL OF MOTOR NEURON, CENTROMERIC COPY; SMNC;;
C-BCD541
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The SMN1 (600354) and SMN2 genes lie within the telomeric and
centromeric halves, respectively, of a large, inverted duplication on
chromosome 5q13. These genes share more than 99% nucleotide identity,
and both are capable of encoding a 294-amino acid RNA-binding protein,
SMN, that is required for efficient assembly of small nuclear
ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complexes. Homozygous loss of the SMN1 gene
causes spinal muscular atrophy (SMA; 253300). Absence of SMN1 is
partially compensated for by SMN2, which produces enough SMN protein to
allow for relatively normal development in cell types other than motor
neurons. However, SMN2 cannot fully compensate for loss of SMN1 because,
although SMN2 is transcribed at a level comparable to that of SMN1, a
large majority of SMN2 transcripts lack exon 7, resulting in production
of a truncated, less stable SMN protein (Lefebvre et al., 1995; Kashima
et al., 2007).

CLONING

Lefebvre et al. (1995) described an inverted duplication of a 500-kb
element in normal chromosome 5q13, which contains the gene for spinal
muscular atrophy. Within the telomeric region, they identified the SMN1
gene. A highly homologous gene, referred to as C-BCD541 and also known
as SMNC or SMN2, was present in the duplicated centromeric element in
95% of controls. PCR amplification and sequence analysis revealed 5
nucleotide discrepancies between the centromeric and telomeric SMN
genes, 2 of which occur in exons 7 and 8. The centromeric SMN gene
undergoes alternative splicing of exon 7, resulting in a truncated mRNA
transcript lacking exon 7 and a putative protein with a different
C-terminal end.

Using a panel of anti-SMN antibodies, Coovert et al. (1997) demonstrated
that the SMN protein is expressed from both the SMN1 and SMN2 genes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Burglen et al. (1996) determined that the SMN gene has 9 exons and spans
approximately 20 kb. Burglen et al. (1996) referred to exon 2 as exons
2a and 2b.

Boda et al. (2004) determined that the first 4.6 kb of the SMN1 and SMN2
promoters are identical. The promoters contain 12 SP1 (189906), 8 AP1
(see 165160), 3 AP2 (107580), 6 HNF3 (see 602294), 24 Zeste (see
601674), and 4 RXR-beta (180246) sites. There are no RE1 elements. Boda
et al. (2004) transfected primary cultures of mouse embryonic spinal
cord and fibroblasts with constructs containing 1.8, 3.2, or 4.6 kb of
the promoter region fused to a reporter gene. Expression of the 1.8- and
3.2-kb constructs was stronger in spinal cord than in fibroblast
cultures; the 4.6-kb construct gave 5-fold higher expression in neurons
than in fibroblasts, with expression in fibroblasts lower than that
achieved with the 3.2-kb construct. Boda et al. (2004) concluded that
these results suggest the presence of an enhancer element between 1.8
and 3.2 kb upstream from the transcriptional start site of the SMN genes
that functions in both culture types, and a silencer between 3.2 and 4.6
kb that is active only in fibroblast cultures.

MAPPING

Lefebvre et al. (1995) determined that the SMN2 gene lies within the
centromeric half of a large inverted duplication on chromosome 5q13. The
SMN1 gene lies in the telomeric half of the duplication.

GENE FUNCTION

Monani et al. (1999) sequenced 3 genomic clones over 32 kb in length,
which spanned both the SMN1 and SMN2 genes. Of 35 sequence differences
noted between SMN1 and SMN2, only 3 were located in either exon 7 or
intron 7. Of note was a translationally silent 840C-T transition at
position +6 in exon 7, which affects splicing. Using minigene
constructs, the authors found that the presence of cytosine at position
+6 in exon 7 produced a normal splicing pattern retaining exon 7,
whereas thymine in this position resulted in the absence of exon 7 in
the majority of the transcripts. Since the majority of human SMN2
transcripts lack exon 7, the authors hypothesized that the 5-prime
portion of exon 7 in SMN1 contains an exonic splice enhancer (ESE), and
that low levels of full-length SMN transcript are responsible for the
SMA phenotype.

Andreassi et al. (2001) screened a library of compounds and found that
aclarubicin increased the retention of exon 7 into the SMN2 transcript
from the endogenous gene in type I SMA fibroblasts, as well as from an
SMN2 minigene in a motor neuron cell line. In type I fibroblasts,
treatment resulted in an increase in SMN protein and gems to normal
levels. The authors demonstrated the utility of high-throughput screens
in detecting compounds that affect the splicing pattern of a gene, and
suggested that alteration of splicing patterns may represent a feasible
approach to modification of gene expression in disease treatment.

Using in vivo splicing assays, Hofmann and Wirth (2002) identified the
protein hnRNPG (300199) and its paralog RBM (400006) as 2 novel splicing
factors that promote the inclusion of SMN2 exon 7. Both hnRNPG and RBM
nonspecifically bind RNA, but directly and specifically bind
Htra2-beta1, an SR-like splicing factor which stimulates inclusion of
exon 7 through a direct interaction with SMN2 exon 7 pre-mRNA. Using
deletion mutants of hnRNPG, the authors demonstrated a specific
protein-protein interaction of hnRNPG with Htra2-beta1 which mediates
the inclusion of SMN2 exon 7 rather than the nonspecific interaction of
hnRNPG with SMN pre-mRNA. These trans-acting splicing factors were also
effective on endogenous SMN2 transcripts and increased the endogenous
SMN protein level. The authors presented a model of how exon 7 mRNA
processing may be regulated by these splicing factors.

Kashima and Manley (2003) showed that the exonic splicing silencer in
SMN2 functions as a binding site for a known repressor protein, HNRNPA1
(164017), which binds to SMN2 but not SMN1 exon 7 RNA. By using small
interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to reduce HNRNPA1 protein levels in living
cells, Kashima and Manley (2003) demonstrated efficient SMN2 exon 7
splicing. The findings not only defined a new mechanism underlying the
inefficient splicing of SMN2 exon 7 but also illustrated more generally
the remarkable sensitivity and precision that characterizes control of
mRNA splicing. The work also made it possible to consider therapeutic
approaches to spinal muscular atrophy that involved decreasing HNRNPA1
RNA binding to or function on SMN2 exon 7.

Helmken et al. (2003) stated that sibs with identical 5q13 homologs and
homozygous absence of SMN1 can have variable phenotypes, suggesting that
the spinal muscular atrophy phenotype is modified by other factors,
which function either on the transcriptional level, to produce more
full-length SMN (FL-SMN) transcripts, or on the translational level, to
increase the amount of SMN2 protein. By analyzing 9 SMA discordant
families, Helmken et al. (2003) demonstrated that in all families
unaffected sibs produced significantly higher amounts of SMN,
SMN-interacting protein-1 (SIP1; 602595), GEMIN3 (606168), ZPR1
(603901), and hnRNPQ protein in lymphoblastoid cell lines, but not in
primary fibroblasts, compared with their affected sibs. The results
suggested that the modifying factor or factors act on the SMN gene to
influence SMN protein levels, thus modifying the SMA phenotype, and not
through an independent pathway. In addition, the observed coregulations
appeared to be tissue-specific. SMN significantly coregulated its
interacting partners, including its own splicing factor, HTRA2-beta-1
(see 606441), due to an indirect feedback mechanism. Thus, Helmken et
al. (2003) showed that reduction of the SMN protein has a significant
impact on the expression level of a splicing factor.

Brichta et al. (2003) showed that in fibroblast cultures derived from
SMA patients treated with therapeutic doses of valproic acid, the level
of full-length SMN2 mRNA/protein increased 2- to 4-fold. This
upregulation of SMN was most likely attributable to increased levels of
HTRA2-beta-1 as well as to SMN gene transcription activation. Valproic
acid also increased SMN protein levels through transcription activation
in organotypic hippocampal rat brain slices. Additionally, valproic acid
increased the expression of other serine-arginine family proteins, which
may have important implications for other disorders affected by
alternative splicing.

Grzeschik et al. (2005) reported that cultured lymphocytes from patients
with SMA showed increased production of the full-length SMN mRNA and
protein in response to treatment with hydroxyurea. The findings
suggested that hydroxyurea promoted inclusion of exon 7 during SMN2
transcription.

Kernochan et al. (2005) investigated the levels of acetylated H3 and H4
histones and histone deacetylases (HDACs) associated with different
regions of the human and mouse SMN genes in both cultured cells and
tissues. The SMN gene had a reproducible pattern of histone acetylation
that was largely conserved among different tissues and species. A
limited region of the promoter surrounding the transcriptional start
site had relatively high levels of histone acetylation. After HDAC
inhibitor treatment, acetylated histone levels increased, particularly
at upstream regions, correlating with a 2-fold increase in promoter
activity. During development in mouse tissues, histone acetylation
levels decreased and associated HDAC2 (605164) levels increased at the
region closest to the transcriptional start site, correlating with a 40
to 60% decrease in SMN transcript and protein levels. Kernochan et al.
(2005) suggested that histone acetylation may modulate SMN gene
expression.

Skipping of SMN2 exon 7 had been attributed to either the loss of an
SF2/ASF-dependent exonic splicing enhancer or the creation of an hnRNP
A/B-dependent exonic splicing silencer, as a result of the C-to-T
transition. Cartegni et al. (2006) reported the extensive testing of the
enhancer-loss and silencer-gain models by mutagenesis, RNA interference,
overexpression, RNA splicing, and RNA-protein interaction experiments.
The results supported the enhancer-loss model but also demonstrated that
hnRNP A/B proteins antagonize SF2/ASF-dependent ESE activity and promote
exon 7 skipping by a mechanism that is independent of the C-to-T
transition and is, therefore, common to both SMN1 and SMN2. The findings
explained the basis of defective SMN2 splicing, illustrated the fine
balance between positive and negative determinants of exon identity and
alternative splicing, and underscored the importance of antagonistic
splicing factors and exonic elements in a disease context.

Kashima et al. (2007) showed that the 840C-T transition in SMN2 created
a high-affinity HNRNPA1-binding site. Depletion of HNRNPA1 in HeLa cells
restored exon 7 inclusion, indicating that splicing of exon 7 in SMN2 is
repressed by an HNRNPA1-dependent exonic splicing silencer.

Kashima et al. (2007) identified a novel single nucleotide difference
between SMN1 and SMN2, an A-to-G change at position +100 within intron 7
of SMN2, which creates a second high-affinity HNRNPA1-binding site
specific to SMN2. Base substitutions that disrupted this site in SMN2
restored exon 7 inclusion in vivo and prevented HNRNPA1 binding in
vitro. Kashima et al. (2007) proposed that interactions between HNRNPA1
molecules bound to the exonic and intronic sites cooperate to exclude
exon 7 in SMN2.

Angelozzi et al. (2008) found that salbutamol increased full-length SMN2
mRNA transcript levels in fibroblasts derived from patients with SMA.
The maximum increase (over 200%) was observed after 30 to 60 minutes.
This rapid rise correlated with decreased levels of SMN2 mRNA with
deletion of exon 7. Salbutamol treatment also resulted in increased SMN
protein levels and nuclear gems.

Using SMN minigenes, Gladman and Chandler (2009) identified 2 elements
within intron 7 of the SMN genes that influenced exon 7 splicing in a
cell type-independent manner.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Spinal Muscular Atrophy

Hahnen et al. (1996) reported molecular analysis of 42 SMA patients who
carried homozygous deletions of exon 7 but not of exon 8 in the
telomeric copy of the SMN gene (SMN1). Additional homozygous deletions
of exon 8 in the centromeric copy of SMN (SMN2) were found in 2 of the
patients. By a simple PCR test, they demonstrated the existence of
hybrid SMN genes, i.e., genes composed of both the centromeric SMN2 and
the telomeric SMN1. They reported a high frequency of hybrid SMN genes
in SMA patients with Czech or Polish background. Hahnen et al. (1996)
identified a single haplotype for half of the hybrid genes analyzed,
suggesting that in these cases the SMA chromosomes shared a common
origin.

Schwartz et al. (1997) used solid-phase minisequencing to determine the
ratio between the number of telomeric and centromeric copies of the SMN
gene in affected and unaffected members of 30 SMA families. Six
predominant haplotypes were identified, 3 for normal chromosomes and 3
for SMA chromosomes, characterized by having 0, 1, or 2 copies,
respectively, of SMN2. They found patients homozygous for a deletion of
SMN1 and with only one copy of SMN2, but found none deleted for all
copies of SMN2. Several asymptomatic carriers of SMA with only a single
copy of SMN1 and no copy of SMN2 were identified. Schwartz et al. (1997)
could not confirm the hypothesis that the presence of more copies of
SMN2 is correlated with a less severe course of the disease. The
frequencies of haplotypes characterized by having 0, 1, or 2 copies,
respectively, of SMN2 were found to differ significantly between normal
and SMA chromosomes. This distribution could be explained by an
underrepresentation of the haplotype completely lacking SMN genes, which
is expected to cause early embryonic death in homozygotes.

Srivastava et al. (2001) reported a 5-year-old boy with childhood-onset
SMA who had a homozygous deletion of SMN2. He had wasting, weakness, and
hyporeflexia, predominantly in the distal muscles. The affected muscles
showed chronic neurogenic changes on electromyography. There was no
sensory involvement. A nerve conduction study showed near-normal
conduction velocity with reduction in the amplitude of the compound
muscle action potential. The SMN2 deletion was demonstrated by studies
of exons 7 and 8 of the SMN genes. Base sequencing and densitometric
analysis of the critical exon 7 region did not show any microdeletion or
duplication of SMN1, but confirmed the deletion of SMN2. Srivastava et
al. (2001) concluded that deletion of SMN2 can also result in the SMA
phenotype.

Feldkotter et al. (2002) developed a quantitative test for either SMN1
or SMN2 to analyze SMA patients for their SMN2 copy number and to
correlate the SMN2 copy number with type of SMA and duration of
survival. The quantitative analysis of SMN2 copies in 375 patients with
type I, type II, or type III SMA showed a significant correlation
between SMN2 copy number and type of SMA as well as duration of
survival. Thus, 80% of patients with type I SMA carried 1 or 2 SMN2
copies and 82% of patients with type II SMA carried 3 SMN2 copies,
whereas 96% of patients with type III SMA carried 3 or 4 SMN2 copies.
Among 113 patients with type I SMA, 9 with 1 SMN2 copy lived less than
11 months, 88 of 94 with 2 SMN2 copies lived less than 21 months, and 8
of 10 with 3 SMN2 copies lived 33 to 66 months. On the basis of SMN2
copy number, Feldkotter et al. (2002) calculated the posterior
probability that a child with homozygous absence of SMN1 will develop
type I, type II, or type III SMA.

Ogino et al. (2004) analyzed all 'available and reliable' data to
calculate allele/haplotype frequencies and new mutation rates in the SMN
region. The authors stated that their data provided the basis for the
most accurate genetic risk calculations as well as evidence that
nucleotide position 840 constitutes a mutation hotspot. Ogino et al.
(2004) suggested that there is selection of the single-copy SMN1-SMN2
haplotype and that rare chromosomes with 3 copies of SMN1 exist.

Wirth et al. (2006) analyzed SMN2 copy number in 115 patients with SMA3
(253400) or SMA4 (271150) who had confirmed homozygous absence of SMN1
and found that 62% of SMA3 patients with age of onset less than 3 years
had 2 or 3 SMN2 copies, whereas 65% of SMA3 patients with age of onset
greater than 3 years had 4 to 5 SMN2 copies. Of the 4 adult-onset (SMA4)
patients, 3 had 4 SMN2 copies and 1 had 6 copies. Wirth et al. (2006)
concluded that SMN2 may have a disease-modifying role in SMA, with a
greater SMN2 copy number associated with later onset and better
prognosis.

Hauke et al. (2009) demonstrated that SMN2 is subject to gene silencing
by DNA methylation. SMN2 contains 4 CpG islands which present highly
conserved methylation patterns and little interindividual variation in
SMN1-deleted SMA patients. The comprehensive analysis of SMN2
methylation in patients suffering from severe versus mild SMA carrying
identical SMN2 copy numbers revealed a correlation of CpG methylation at
the positions -290 and -296 with disease severity and the activity of
the first transcriptional start site of SMN2 at position -296. The
methyl-CpG-binding protein-2 (MECP2; 300005), a transcriptional
repressor, bound to the critical SMN2 promoter region in a
methylation-dependent manner. The authors identified histone deacetylase
(HDAC) inhibitors (including vorinostat and romidepsin) that were able
to bypass SMN2 gene silencing by DNA methylation, while others (such as
valproic acid and phenylbutyrate) did not, due to HDAC isoenzyme
specificities. The authors concluded that DNA methylation is
functionally important regarding SMA disease progression, and
pharmacologic SMN2 gene activation might have implications for future
SMA therapy regimens.

- Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis

Moulard et. al. (1998) found homozygous deletions of SMN2 in 36% of
individuals with sporadic adult-onset lower motor neuron disease (LMND),
but in only 6.2% of individuals with sporadic amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS; 105400) and 1.5% of individuals with familial ALS. The
authors argued that SMN2, but not SMN1, deletions are a susceptibility
factor for LMND, a disorder distinguishable from ALS by the absence of
upper motor neuron signs. LMND patients with SMN2 deletions differed
from those patients without such deletions by earlier age of onset (40
vs 56 years), more rapid disease progression (25 vs 36 months to death),
and a lower preponderance of males (M:F ratio of 1.5 vs 2.5).

Among 124 ALS patients, Gamez et al. (2002) found no association between
homozygous deletion of SMN2 and disease onset, respiratory decline, or
survival. A homozygous SMN2 deletion was identified in 11 (8.8%)
patients and 20 (10%) of 200 control individuals. Corcia et al. (2002)
found no difference in SMN2 gene copies among 167 ALS patients and 167
controls. Homozygous deletion of the SMN2 gene was found in 9 and 10% of
patients and controls, respectively. Among 600 patients with sporadic
ALS, Corcia et al. (2006) found no disease association with SMN2 copy
number.

Crawford and Skolasky (2002) briefly reviewed several reported
associations of SMN to ALS and concluded that the findings likely
represented nonsignificant or borderline significant fluctuations.
Corcia et al. (2002) responded that although they still supported a role
for the SMN2 gene in LMND (Moulard et al., 1998), the evidence of an
association between homozygous SMN2 deletion and ALS was less
convincing.

EVOLUTION

Rochette et al. (2001) used a number of approaches to probe the
evolutionary history of the SMN1 and SMN2 genes and showed that SMN gene
duplication and the appearance of SMN2 occurred at very distinct
evolutionary times. Molecular fossil and molecular clock data suggested
that this duplication may have occurred as recently as 3 million years
ago in that the position and repetitive elements are identical for both
human SMN genes and overall sequence divergence ranges from 0.15 to
0.34%. However, these approaches ignored the possibility of sequence
homogenization by means of gene conversion. Consequently, Rochette et
al. (2001) used quantitative polymerase chain reaction and analysis of
allelic variants to provide physical evidence for or against SMN gene
duplication in the chimpanzee, mankind's closest relative. These studies
revealed that chimpanzees have 2 to 7 copies of the SMN gene per diploid
genome; however, the 2 nucleotides diagnostic for exons 7-8 and the
SMNdel7 mRNA product of the SMN2 gene are absent in nonhuman primates.
In contrast, the SMN2 gene has been detected in all extant human
populations studied to date, including representatives from Europe, the
Central African Republic, and the Congo. These data provided conclusive
evidence that SMN gene duplication occurred more than 5 million years
ago, before the separation of human and chimpanzee lineages, but that
SMN2 appeared for the first time in Homo sapiens.

ANIMAL MODEL

Le et al. (2005) created transgenic mice expressing SMN2 lacking exon 7
(SMN-delta-7) and crossed them onto a severe SMA background. Expression
of SMN-delta-7 appeared to extend survival of SMA mice from 5 to 13
days. Unlike mice with selective deletion of SMN exon 7 in muscle, mice
with a small amount of full-length SMN (FL-SMN) did not show a
dystrophic phenotype. The authors suggested that low levels of FL-SMN
(as found in SMA patients) and absence of FL-SMN in muscle tissue may
have different effects, and raised the question of the importance of
high SMN levels in muscle in the presentation of SMA. SMN and
SMN-delta-7 can associate with each other; Le et al. (2005) suggested
that this association may stabilize SMN-delta-7 protein turnover and
ameliorate the SMA phenotype by increasing the amount of oligomeric SMN.

In SMA-like mouse embryonic fibroblasts and human SMN2-transfected motor
neuron cells, Ting et al. (2007) found that sodium vanadate,
trichostatin A, and aclarubicin effectively enhanced SMN2 expression by
inducing Stat5 (601511) activation. This resulted in enhanced SMN2
promoter activity with an increase in both full-length and deletion exon
7 SMN transcripts in human cells with SMN2. Knockdown of Stat5
expression disrupted the effects of sodium vanadate on SMN2 activation,
but did not influence SMN2 splicing, suggesting that Stat5 signaling is
involved in SMN2 transcriptional regulation. Constitutive expression of
the activated Stat5 mutant Stat5A1*6 profoundly increased the number of
nuclear gems in SMA patient lymphocytes and reduced SMA-like motor
neuron axon outgrowth defects.

Workman et al. (2009) showed that SMN(A111G), an allele capable of snRNP
assembly (A111G; 600354.0015), can rescue mice that lacked Smn and
contained either 1 or 2 copies of SMN2 (SMA mice). The correction of SMA
in these animals was directly correlated with snRNP assembly activity in
spinal cord, as was correction of snRNA levels. These data support snRNP
assembly as being the critical function affected in SMA and suggests
that the levels of snRNPs are critical to motor neurons. Furthermore,
SMN(A111G) could not rescue Smn-null mice without SMN2, suggesting that
both SMN(A111G) and SMN from SMN2 may undergo intragenic complementation
in vivo to function in heteromeric complexes that have greater function
than either allele alone. The oligomer composed of limiting full-length
SMN and SMN(A111G) had substantial snRNP assembly activity. The SMN(A2G)
(A2G; 600354.0002) and SMN(A111G) alleles in vivo did not complement
each other, leading to the possibility that these mutations could affect
the same function.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY, MODIFIER OF
SMN2, GLY287ARG

In a 42-year-old woman with a mild form of SMA type III (253400),
despite a homozygous absence of SMN1 exon 7 (600354), Prior et al.
(2009) identified a homozygous 859G-C transversion in exon 7 of the SMN2
gene, resulting in a gly287-to-arg (G287R) substitution. In vitro
functional expression studies showed that the change resulted in the
creation of an exonic splicing enhancer element and increased the amount
of full-length SMN2 transcripts compared to wildtype. The SMN1 genotype
(0 SMN1, 0 SNM2) predicted a more severe disorder (SMA1; 253300), but
the SMN2 variant increased SMN2 transcripts, resulting in a less severe
phenotype. The same 859G-C transversion was identified in heterozygosity
in 2 additional unrelated patients with mild forms of SMA, who were
predicted to have a more severe form of the disorder from their
genotypes (0 SMN1/1 SMN2 and 0 SMN1, 2 SMN2).

;;miRNA181C;;
MIRN181C
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), such as MIR181C, are short noncoding RNAs that
repress translation or induce cleavage of target mRNAs with which they
interact (Ciafre et al., 2005).

GENE FUNCTION

Using microarray analysis, Ciafre et al. (2005) found that expression of
MIR181C was significantly downregulated in primary glioblastomas and
human glioblastoma cell lines compared with normal brain tissue.

MAPPING

Ciafre et al. (2005) stated that the MIR181C gene maps to chromosome
19p13.3.

601614	TITLE *601614 NETRIN 1, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; NTN1
;;NETRIN 1-LIKE; NTN1L
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Embryologic experiments in both vertebrates and invertebrates provide
evidence that developing axons are guided to their targets in the
nervous system by the combined actions of attractive and repulsive
guidance cues (Tessier-Lavigne and Goodman, 1996). One family of
putative guidance cues for developing axons are the netrins, large
(approximately 70-80 kD), soluble proteins that show homology in their
amino termini to portions of the extracellular matrix molecule laminin
(see 150320) and that have been implicated in axon guidance through
distinct and complementary lines of evidence in worms, flies, and
vertebrates. Netrin-1 is a diffusible protein made by floor plate cells;
it can attract spinal commissural axons and repel trochlear axons in
vitro (summary by Serafini et al., 1996).

CLONING

Serafini et al. (1996) isolated cDNA clones comprising the entire coding
region of murine netrin-1. PCR was performed on reverse-transcribed
mouse brain poly(A)+ RNA using primers based upon sequence homologies
between chick netrin-1 and C. elegans Unc6.

Using degenerate PCR primers derived from highly conserved C-terminal
domains of chicken netrin-1, netrin-2 (see 602349), and Unc6 proteins,
followed by screening of a human brainstem cDNA library, Meyerhardt et
al. (1999) isolated NTN1 cDNA. The NTN1 gene encodes a 604-amino acid
protein with 98% identity to mouse netrin-1 and 50% identity to C.
elegans Unc6. Northern blot analysis detected a 5.0-kb NTN1 transcript
in most normal adult human tissues studied. Markedly reduced or absent
NTN1 expression was seen in approximately 50% of brain tumors and
neuroblastomas by RNase protection assays.

GENE FUNCTION

Using Xenopus, Hopker et al. (1999) demonstrated that laminin-1-beta
(150240) from the extracellular matrix converts netrin-mediated
attraction into repulsion. A soluble peptide fragment of laminin-1-beta
(YIGSR) mimicked this laminin-induced conversion. Low levels of cAMP in
growth cones also led to the conversion of netrin-induced attraction
into repulsion, and Hopker et al. (1999) showed that the amount of cAMP
decreases in the presence of laminin-1 or YIGSR, suggesting a possible
mechanism for laminin's effect. At the netrin-1-rich optic nerve head,
where axons turn sharply to leave the eye, laminin-1 is confined to the
retinal surface. Repulsion from the region in which laminin and netrin
are coexpressed may help to drive axons into the region where only
netrin is present, providing a mechanism for their escape from the
retinal surface. Hopker et al. (1999) concluded that extracellular
matrix molecules not only promote axon outgrowth, but also modify the
behavior of growth cones in response to diffusible guidance cues.

Meyerhardt et al. (1999) showed that netrin-1 protein could be
crosslinked to DCC (120470) protein on the cell surface, but did not
immunoprecipitate with DCC in the absence of crosslinking and failed to
bind to a soluble fusion protein containing the entire DCC extracellular
domain. Meyerhardt et al. (1999) concluded that the binding of netrin-1
to DCC appears to depend on the presence of a coreceptor or accessory
proteins.

The axonal chemoattractant netrin-1 guides spinal commissural axons by
activating its receptor DCC. Galko and Tessier-Lavigne (2000) found that
chemical inhibitors of metalloproteases potentiate netrin-mediated axon
outgrowth in vitro. Galko and Tessier-Lavigne (2000) also found that DCC
is a substrate for metalloprotease-dependent ectodomain shedding, and
that the inhibitors block proteolytic processing of DCC and cause an
increase in DCC protein levels on axons within spinal cord explants.
Thus, Galko and Tessier-Lavigne (2000) suggested that potentiation of
netrin activity by inhibitors may result from stabilization of DCC on
the axons, and proteolytic activity may regulate axon migration by
controlling the number of functional extracellular axon guidance
receptors.

Corset et al. (2000) showed that DCC interacts with the
membrane-associated adenosine A2b receptor (600466), a G protein-coupled
receptor that induces cAMP accumulation on binding adenosine. Corset et
al. (2000) showed that adenosine A2b receptor is actually a netrin-1
receptor and induces cAMP accumulation on binding netrin-1, and that
netrin-1-dependent outgrowth of dorsal spinal cord axons directly
involves A2b. Corset et al. (2000) concluded that the growth-promoting
function of netrin-1 may require a receptor complex containing DCC and
A2b.

Stein et al. (2001) demonstrated that netrin-1 binds DCC and that the
DCC cytoplasmic domain fused to a heterologous receptor ectodomain can
mediate guidance through a mechanism involving derepression of
cytoplasmic domain multimerization. Activation of the adenosine A2B
receptor, proposed to contribute to netrin effects on axons, is not
required for rat commissural axon outgrowth or Xenopus spinal axon
attraction to netrin-1. Thus, Stein et al. (2001) concluded that DCC
plays a central role in netrin signaling of axon growth and guidance
independent of A2B receptor activation.

Axonal growth cones that cross the nervous system midline change their
responsiveness to midline guidance cues: they become repelled by the
repellent Slit (603746) and simultaneously lose responsiveness to the
attractant netrin. These mutually reinforcing changes help to expel
growth cones from the midline by making a once-attractive environment
appear repulsive. Stein and Tessier-Lavigne (2001) provided evidence
that these 2 changes are causally linked: in the growth cones of
embryonic Xenopus spinal axons, activation of the Slit receptor
Roundabout (Robo; 602430) silences the attractive effect of netrin-1,
but not its growth-stimulatory effect, through direct binding of the
cytoplasmic domain of Robo to that of the netrin receptor DCC.
Biologically, this hierarchical silencing mechanism helps to prevent a
tug-of-war between attractive and repulsive signals in the growth cone
that might cause confusion. Molecularly, silencing is enabled by a
modular and interlocking design of the cytoplasmic domains of these
potentially antagonistic receptors that predetermines the outcome of
their simultaneous activation.

In a 'whole-optic pathway' preparation in Xenopus devised to assess the
behavior of retinal growth cones at 4 defined points along the optic
pathway, Shewan et al. (2002) found a gradual change in axonal response
to netrin-1, from attraction to repulsion at progressively distal points
along the pathway. Axons aged in culture underwent similar changes which
correlated with a decline in cAMP and netrin-1 receptor (ADORA2B;
600446) expression, suggesting that responsiveness is intrinsically and
developmentally regulated, and also suggesting a possible molecular
basis for the altered responsiveness.

Forcet et al. (2002) showed that in embryonic kidney cells expressing
full-length, but not cytoplasmic domain-truncated, DCC (120470), NTN1
causes increased transient phosphorylation and activity of ERK1 (601795)
and ERK2 (176948), but not of JNK1 (601158), JNK2 (602896), or p38
(MAPK14; 600289). This phosphorylation was mediated by MEK1 (MAP2K1;
176872) and/or MEK2 (MAP2K2; 601263). NTN1 also activated the
transcription factor ELK1 (311040) and serum response element-regulated
gene expression. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed interaction of
full-length DCC with MEK1/2 in the presence or absence of NTN1. Forcet
et al. (2002) showed that activation of Dcc by Ntn1 in rat embryonic
day-13 dorsal spinal cord stimulates and is required for the outgrowth
of commissural axons and Erk1/2 activation. Immunohistochemical analysis
demonstrated expression of activated Erk1/2 in embryonic commissural
axons, and this expression was diminished in Dcc or Ntn1 knockout
animals. Forcet et al. (2002) concluded that the MAPK pathway is
involved in responses to NTN1 and proposed that ERK activation affects
axonal growth by phosphorylation of microtubule-associated proteins and
neurofilaments.

Ming et al. (2002) found that axonal growth cones of cultured frog
spinal neurons exhibit adaptation during chemotactic migration,
undergoing consecutive phases of desensitization and resensitization in
the presence of increasing basal concentrations of the guidance factors
Ntn1 or Bdnf1 (113505). Ntn1- or Bdnf1-specific desensitization was
accompanied by a reduction of calcium signaling, whereas resensitization
required activation of Mapk and local protein synthesis. Ming et al.
(2002) suggested that the protracted nature of this process allows
adaptive changes in the sensitivity of the growth cone and that the
adaptive behavior exemplifies the image of the growth cone as a
chemotaking amoeba, as proposed in the 19th century by Ramon y Cajal.

Nishiyama et al. (2003) reported that the ratio of cyclic AMP to cyclic
GMP activities sets the polarity of netrin-1-induced axon guidance: high
ratios favor attraction, whereas low ratios favor repulsion. Whole-cell
recordings of calcium currents in Xenopus spinal neuron growth cones
indicated that cyclic nucleotide signaling directly modulates the
activity of L-type calcium channels in axonal growth cones. Furthermore,
cyclic GMP signaling activated by an arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase
metabolite suppressed L-type calcium channel activity triggered by
netrin-1, and was required for growth cone repulsion mediated by the
DCC-UNC5 (see 603610) receptor complex. By linking cyclic AMP and cyclic
GMP signaling and modulation of calcium channel activity in growth
cones, these findings delineated an early membrane-associated event
responsible for signal transduction during bidirectional axon guidance.

Mehlen et al. (1998) showed that DCC induces apoptosis conditionally: by
functioning as a dependence receptor, DCC induces apoptosis unless it is
engaged by its ligand netrin-1. Mazelin et al. (2004) demonstrated that
inhibition of cell death by enforced expression of netrin-1 in mouse
gastrointestinal tract led to the spontaneous formation of hyperplastic
and neoplastic lesions. Moreover, in the adenomatous polyposis coli
mutant background associated with adenoma formation, enforced expression
of netrin-1 engendered aggressive adenocarcinomatous malignancies.
Mazelin et al. (2004) concluded that netrin-1 can promote intestinal
tumor development, probably by regulating cell survival. Thus, a
netrin-1 receptor or receptors function as conditional tumor
suppressors.

Blood vessels and nerves often follow with parallel trajectories,
suggesting that distal targets use common cues that induce
vascularization and innervation. Netrins are secreted by the floor plate
and attract commissural axons toward the midline of the neural tube.
Park et al. (2004) showed that netrin-1 is also a potent vascular
mitogen. Netrin-1 stimulates proliferation, induces migration, and
promotes adhesion of endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells
with a specific activity comparable to vascular endothelial growth
factor (PEGF; 192240) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF; see
173430). The authors presented evidence indicating that the netrin
receptor neogenin (NEO1; 601907) mediates netrin signaling in vascular
smooth muscle cells, but suggested that an unidentified receptor
mediates the proangiogenic effects of netrin-1 on endothelial cells.
Netrin-1 also stimulates angiogenesis in vivo and augments the response
to vascular endothelial growth factor. Park et al. (2004) concluded that
netrin-1 is a secreted neural guidance cue with the unique ability to
attract both blood vessels and axons and that other cues may also
function as vascular endothelial growth factors.

Netrin proteins play a role in the developing nervous system by
promoting both axonal outgrowth and axonal guidance in pathfinding. Liu
et al. (2004), Li et al. (2004), and Ren et al. (2004) simultaneously
reported a complex network of intracellular signaling downstream from
netrin-1 involving DCC (120470), focal adhesion kinase (FAK; 600758),
and FYN (137025), a member of the SRC family kinases (see 190090). In
neurons cultured from rat cerebral cortex, Liu et al. (2004) found that
netrin-1 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and FYN, and
coimmunoprecipitation studies showed direct interaction of FAK and FYN
with DCC. Inhibition of FYN inhibited FAK phosphorylation, and FYN
mutants inhibited the attractive turning responses to netrin. Neurons
lacking the FAK gene showed reduced axonal outgrowth and attractive
turning responses to netrin. In cultured neurons from chick and mouse,
Li et al. (2004) found that netrin increased tyrosine phosphorylation of
DCC and FAK. Coimmunoprecipitation studies showed that DCC interacted
directly with FAK and SRC to form a complex and that FAK and SRC
cooperated to stimulate DCC phosphorylation by SRC. Li et al. (2004)
suggested that phosphorylated DCC acts as a kinase-coupled receptor and
that FAK and SRC act downstream of DCC in netrin signaling. Ren et al.
(2004) found that inhibition of FAK phosphorylation inhibited
netrin-1-induced axonal outgrowth and guidance. The authors suggested
that FAK may also function as a scaffolding protein and play a role in
cytoskeletal reorganization that is necessary for neurite outgrowth and
turning.

Lu et al. (2004) showed that the repulsive netrin receptor UNC5B
(607870) is expressed by endothelial tip cells of the vascular system.
Disruption of the Unc5b gene in mice or of Unc5b or netrin-1A in
zebrafish led to aberrant extension of endothelial tip cell filopodia,
excessive vessel branching, and abnormal navigation. Netrin-1 caused
endothelial filopodial retraction, but only when Unc5b was present.
Thus, Lu et al. (2004) concluded that UNC5B functions as a repulsive
netrin receptor in endothelial cells controlling morphogenesis of the
vascular system.

Larrivee et al. (2007) found that Unc5b was downregulated in quiescent
adult mouse vasculature, but it was reexpressed during sprouting
angiogenesis in 3-dimensional gels and in tumor implants. Stimulation of
Unc5b-expressing neovessels with netrin-1 inhibited sprouting
angiogenesis, and genetic loss of Unc5b reduced netrin-1-mediated
inhibition of angiogenesis. Expression of Unc5b triggered endothelial
cell repulsion in response to netrin-1 in vitro, whereas a truncated
Unc5b lacking the intracellular signaling domain failed to induce
repulsion. Larrivee et al. (2007) concluded that activation of UNC5B by
netrin-1 inhibits sprouting angiogenesis.

Wang and Poo (2005) reported that TRP (transient receptor
potential)-like channel activity exists in the growth cones of cultured
Xenopus neurons and can be modulated by exposure to netrin-1 and
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; 113505), 2 chemoattractants for
axon guidance. Whole-cell recording from growth cones showed that
netrin-1 induced a membrane depolarization, part of which remained after
all major voltage-dependent channels were blocked. Furthermore, the
membrane depolarization was sensitive to blockers of TRP channels.
Pharmacologic blockade of putative TRP currents or downregulation of
Xenopus TRP1 (xTRPC1) expression with a specific morpholino
oligonucleotide abolished the growth cone turning and calcium ion
elevation induced by a netrin-1 gradient. Thus, Wang and Poo (2005)
concluded that TRPC currents reflect early events in the growth cone's
detection of some extracellular guidance signal, resulting in membrane
depolarization and cytoplasmic calcium ion elevation that mediates the
turning of growth cones.

Wilson et al. (2006) demonstrated that netrins stimulate proliferation,
migration, and tube formation of human endothelial cells in vitro and
that this stimulation is independent of known netrin receptors.
Suppression of netrin-1a mRNA in zebrafish inhibited vascular sprouting,
implying a proangiogenic role for netrins during vertebrate development.
Wilson et al. (2006) also showed that netrins accelerate
neovascularization in an in vivo model of ischemia and that they reverse
neuropathy and vasculopathy in a diabetic murine model. Wilson et al.
(2006) found that vectors expressing netrin-1 and netrin-4 (NTN4;
610401) are comparable in effectiveness to vectors expressing VEGF
(192240) and promoting neovascularization and reperfusion.

Colon-Ramos et al. (2007) showed that connectivity between 2
interneurons in C. elegans, AIY and RIA, is orchestrated by a pair of
glial cells that express UNC6 (netrin-1). In the postsynaptic neuron
RIA, the netrin receptor UNC40 (DCC; 120470) plays a conventional
guidance role, directing outgrowth of the RIA process ventrally toward
the glia. The authors demonstrated that in the presynaptic neuron AIY,
UNC40 plays an unexpected and theretofore uncharacterized role: it
cell-autonomously promotes assembly of presynaptic terminals in the
immediate vicinity of the glial cell endfeet. Colon-Ramos et al. (2007)
concluded that netrin can be used both for guidance and local
synaptogenesis and suggested that glial cells can function as guideposts
during the assembly of neural circuits in vivo.

Using cultured rat and frog spinal neurons, Ly et al. (2008) showed that
Dscam (602523) could mediate the turning response to netrin-1 both alone
and in collaboration with the netrin receptor Dcc.

Using primary neurons derived from rat, mouse, and chicken embryos,
Furne et al. (2008) showed that Ntn1, in addition to behaving as an
attractive cue, functioned in cell survival by inhibiting the
proapoptotic activity of Dcc.

By quantitative RT-PCR of 51 primary breast tumors, Fitamant et al.
(2008) found significantly increased expression of netrin-1 in a high
proportion of lymph node-positive tumors and tumors from metastatic
patients. Netrin-1-expressing mammary metastatic tumor cell lines
underwent apoptosis when netrin-1 expression was experimentally
decreased or when decoy soluble netrin receptor ectodomains were added.
Such treatments prevented lung metastasis of a mammary cancer cell line
and a xenografted human breast tumor in mice. Fitamant et al. (2008)
concluded that netrin-1 expression confers a selective advantage for
tumor cell survival.

Moore et al. (2009) showed that traction on immobilized netrin-1 was
sufficient to reorient axons.

Delloye-Bourgeois et al. (2009) showed that autocrine production of NTN1
conveyed a selective advantage in tumor growth and dissemination in
aggressive forms of neuroblastoma (NB; see 256700) by blocking the
proapoptotic activity of the UNC5H receptors. NTN1 upregulation appeared
to be a marker for poor prognosis in infants with stage 4S and stage 4
NB. NTN1 disruption blocked NB metastasis in animals, and
Delloye-Bourgeois et al. (2009) proposed disrupting NTN1 expression as
an anticancer strategy.

MAPPING

Meyerhardt et al. (1999) mapped the human NTN1 gene to chromosome
17p13-p12 by FISH.

ANIMAL MODEL

Serafini et al. (1996) used the method of Skarnes et al. (1995) in
embryonic stem cells to selectively recover mutations in genes encoding
proteins with signal sequences by virtue of creating fusions of
N-terminal portions of these proteins with an exogenous transmembrane
domain. In this way Serafini et al. (1996) isolated a mutated murine
netrin-1 gene and transmitted it through the germline. Homozygotes were
born but apparently did not suckle and died within a few days.
Netrin-1-deficient mice exhibited defects in spinal commissural axon
projections that were considered consistent with netrin-1 guiding these
axons. Defects in several forebrain commissures were also observed,
suggesting additional guidance roles for netrin-1.

Poon et al. (2008) demonstrated that the axon guidance cue unc6/netrin
and its receptor unc5 (607869) act throughout development to exclude
synaptic vesicle and active zone proteins from the dendrite of the C.
elegans motor neuron DA9, which is proximal to a source of unc6/netrin.
In unc6/netrin and unc5 loss-of-function mutants, presynatic components
mislocalized to the DA9 dendrite. In addition, ectopically expressed
unc6/netrin, acting through unc5, was sufficient to exclude endogenous
synapses from adjacent subcellular domains within the DA9 axon.
Furthermore, this antisynaptogenic activity was interchangeable with
that of lin44/Wnt despite being transduced through different receptors,
suggesting that extracellular cues such as netrin and Wnts not only
guide axon navigation but also regulate the polarized accumulation of
presynaptic components through local exclusion.

185630	TITLE *185630 SURFEIT 2; SURF2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using mouse Surf2 cDNA to screen placenta and HeLa cell cDNA libraries,
followed by database analysis and 3-prime RACE of a HeLa cDNA library,
Lennard et al. (1994) cloned human SURF2. The deduced 256-amino acid
protein shares 69% identity with mouse Surf2.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lennard et al. (1994) found that the major start sites of the SURF1
(185620) and SURF2 genes are separated by 97 bp, although both genes
have multiple transcription start sites. The intergenic region is
expected to have bidirectional promoter activity, as is found in mouse.
This region lacks a TATA box, but is GC-rich. DNase footprint analysis
showed 4 regions that interacted with HeLa cell nuclear factor
complexes.

Duhig et al. (1998) stated that the 5-prime end of each of the surfeit
genes, including SURF2, is contained within a CpG island. Although the
mouse Surf2 and Surf4 (185660) genes overlap at their 3-prime ends,
human SURF2 and SURF4 are separated by 302 bp due to a much shorter
3-prime UTR in the human SURF2 gene.

MAPPING

Using FISH, Yon et al. (1993) mapped the SURF2 gene within the surfeit
gene cluster on chromosome 9q34. They stated that the mouse surfeit gene
cluster maps to the proximal portion of chromosome 2.

Duhig et al. (1998) determined that the human surfeit gene cluster spans
60 kb on chromosome 9q34.

600960	TITLE *600960 SET TRANSLOCATION, MYELOID LEUKEMIA-ASSOCIATED; SET
;;INHIBITOR OF GZMA-ACTIVATED DNase; IGAAD
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The translocation (6;9)(p23q34) is the hallmark of a specific subtype of
acute myeloid leukemia (AML) characterized by a poor prognosis and a
young age of onset. It is classified in the French-American-British
(FAB) system mostly as M2/M4 and rarely as M1 or refractive anemia with
excess of blast cells (RAEB). On chromosome 9, breakpoints take place in
a specific intron, denoted icb-9, of a large gene named Cain (CAN;
114350). On chromosome 6, breakpoints occur in a single intron, icb-6,
of a gene named DEK (125264). In a patient with acute undifferentiated
leukemia and an apparently normal karyotype, von Lindern et al. (1992)
found a breakpoint in icb-9 of the CAN gene in a bone marrow sample but
detected no breakpoint in DEK. They isolated and characterized a novel
gene, named SET (suppressor of variegation, enhancer of zeste, and
Trithorax), that was fused to CAN in the leukemic cells of this patient.
A chimeric SET-CAN transcript whose sequence predicted a fusion protein
of 155 kD was detected. The SET gene encodes transcripts of 2.0 and 2.7
kb that result from the use of alternative polyadenylation sites. Both
transcripts contained the open reading frame for a putative protein with
a predicted molecular mass of 32 kD. The SET sequence showed homology
with the yeast nucleosome assembly protein NAP-I. The only common
sequence motif of SET and DEK proteins is an acidic region. SET has a
long acidic tail, of which a large part is present in the predicted
SET-CAN fusion protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Carlson et al. (1998) studied the role of SET in the regulation of renal
cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. The mRNA encoding SET was
expressed at much higher levels in transformed human and rodent cell
lines than in cultured renal epithelial and primary endothelial cells.
Consistent with a role for SET in cell proliferation, SET mRNA
expression was markedly reduced in cells rendered quiescent by serum
starvation, contact inhibition, or differentiation. Previous findings
during renal development were extended by demonstrating that SET protein
expression is also much greater in developing rat and human kidney than
in fully differentiated, mature kidney. Finally, high levels of SET mRNA
and SET protein expression were found in Wilms tumor but not in renal
cell carcinoma, adult polycystic kidney disease, or in transitional cell
carcinoma. The SET domain (Tschiersch et al., 1994) is found in proteins
that are involved in embryonic development (Tripoulas et al., 1996).

Granzyme A (GZMA; 140050) induces a caspase-independent cell death
pathway characterized by single-stranded DNA nicks and other features of
apoptosis. A GZMA-activated DNase (GAAD) is in an endoplasmic
reticulum-associated complex containing pp32 (600832) and the GZMA
substrates SET, HMG2 (163906), and APE1 (107748). Fan et al. (2003)
showed that GAAD is NM23H1 (156490), a nucleoside diphosphate kinase
implicated in suppression of tumor metastasis, and its specific
inhibitor (IGAAD) is SET. NM23H1 bound SET and was released from
inhibition by GZMA cleavage of SET. After GZMA loading or cytotoxic T
lymphocyte attack, SET and NM23H1 translocated to the nucleus and SET
was degraded, allowing NM23H1 to nick chromosomal DNA. GZMA-treated
cells with silenced NM23H1 expression were resistant to GZMA-mediated
DNA damage and cytolysis, while cells overexpressing NM23H1 were more
sensitive.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis using the N-terminal 277 amino acids of SET
as bait, Minakuchi et al. (2001) identified SET-binding protein-1
(SETBP1; 611060). Deletion and mutagenesis analysis revealed that amino
acids 182 to 223 of SET interacted with amino acids 1238 to 1434 of
SETBP1. Immunoprecipitation analysis verified that SETBP1 interacted
with endogenous SET in a human osteosarcoma cell line.

Ischemia and seizure cause excessive neuronal excitation that is
associated with brain acidosis and neuronal cell death. Liu et al.
(2008) found that the neurotoxin kainic acid activated lysosomal
asparagine endopeptidase (AEP, or LGMN; 602620) in mouse brain and
triggered degradation of Set, followed by DNA nicking and neuronal cell
death. Pike-L (CENTG1; 605476) strongly bound Set in the nucleus and
protected Set from proteolytic cleavage by Aep in vitro and in vivo,
thereby diminishing DNA damage and neuronal cell death. Kainic acid or
stroke failed to provoke DNA nicking and neuronal cell death in
Aep-deficient mice.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, von Lindern et al. (1992)
assigned the SET gene to 9q34, centromeric of ABL (189980).

606453	TITLE *606453 LIPOPOLYSACCHARIDE-RESPONSIVE, BEIGE-LIKE ANCHOR PROTEIN; LRBA
;;LBA;;
CELL DIVISION CYCLE 4-LIKE PROTEIN; CDC4L;;
CDC4-LIKE PROTEIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Patients with Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS1; 214500) suffer from a
systemic immunodeficiency involving defects in polarized trafficking of
vesicles in a number of immune system cell types. In mouse, this
syndrome is reproduced in strains with a mutation in the 'beige' gene
that results in proteins lacking the BEACH (beige and CHS1) domain and
C-terminal WD repeats. LRBA contains key features of both beige/CHS1 and
A kinase anchor proteins (AKAPs; see 602449).

CLONING

Using a differential screening strategy to identify chimeric cDNA clones
derived from long-terminal repeat-promoted transcripts, Feuchter et al.
(1992) obtained a partial cDNA encoding LRBA, which they termed CDC4L
due to its homology to the yeast cell division cycle gene Cdc4.

By gene trapping of a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-inducible clone, PCR of a
mouse B-lymphocyte cDNA library, 5-prime and 3-prime RACE, and searching
sequence databases, Wang et al. (2001) obtained cDNAs encoding human
LRBA and 3 isoforms of mouse Lrba. Sequence analysis predicted that the
2,856-, 2,792-, and 2,579-amino acid mouse proteins (designated alpha,
beta, and gamma, respectively) all have a WD repeat-like (WDL) domain, a
BEACH domain with an SH3-binding site, and a unique C terminus. The
alpha isoform has 5 WD repeats, while the beta isoform has 3 and the
gamma isoform lacks WD repeats. The 2,863-amino acid human LRBA protein
is 85% identical to the mouse protein, and they have homology to a
Drosophila anchor protein, Akap550. Northern blot analysis using a mouse
Lrba probe revealed that expression of a 10-kb transcript was
upregulated in LPS-induced B-cell and macrophage lines. Simultaneous
multiplex RT-PCR analysis detected variable expression of the 3 Lrba
isoforms in cell lines and mouse tissues. Fluorescent, confocal, and
immunogold electron microscopy demonstrated upregulated expression of
the BEACH-WD region of Lrba in cytosolic vesicles after LPS stimulation;
it specifically colocalized with lysosomes and the Golgi apparatus. Wang
et al. (2001) proposed that LRBA is part of a WDL-BEACH-WD (WBW) gene
family. They concluded that LRBA is constitutively associated with
protein kinase A (PKA; see 176911), which, upon LPS stimulation and
BEACH phosphorylation, binds to intracellular vesicles that are
transported to the plasma membrane.

Lopez-Herrera et al. (2012) found expression of the LRBA gene in
multiple human tissues, both immune-related and nonimmune-related.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the LRBA
gene to chromosome 4 (TMAP stSG9931).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 5 patients from 4 unrelated consanguineous families with common
variable immunodeficiency-8 with autoimmunity (CVID8; 614700),
Lopez-Herrera et al. (2012) identified 4 different homozygous mutations
in the LRBA gene (606453.0001-606453.0004). The first mutation was found
by linkage analysis followed by candidate gene sequencing. Heterozygous
mutation carriers were unaffected. Affected individuals had
early-childhood onset of recurrent infections, particularly respiratory
infections, and also developed variable autoimmune disorders, including
idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and
inflammatory bowel disease. Laboratory studies showed decreased numbers
of switched memory B cells, hypogammaglobulinemia, and variable other
defects. Cultured patient B cells showed a failure to proliferate,
differentiate into plasma cells, or produce antibodies under inducible
conditions. Patient cells also showed an increased susceptibility to
apoptosis, most likely due to impaired autophagy and abnormal
accumulation of cellular organelles. No LRBA mutations were found in 12
additional families with suspected autosomal recessive CVID.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
IMMUNODEFICIENCY, COMMON VARIABLE, 8, WITH AUTOIMMUNITY
LRBA, ILE2657SER

In 2 sibs, born of consanguineous Arab parents, with common variable
immunodeficiency syndrome-8 with autoimmunity (CVID8; 614700),
Lopez-Herrera et al. (2012) identified a homozygous 7970T-G transversion
in exon 54 of the LRBA gene, resulting in an ile2657-to-ser (I2657S)
substitution in a highly conserved residue. Each unaffected parent and 4
unaffected sibs were heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found
in 128 controls. The mutation was identified by linkage analysis
followed by candidate gene sequencing. Immunoblot analysis of patient
cells showed complete absence of the LRBA protein, suggesting that the
mutant protein was unstable. Naive B cells from the patients showed
extremely low levels of IgG, IgA, and IgM antibody production and
lymphocyte proliferation when stimulated. Patient cells also showed
increased apoptosis under serum depletion compared to controls, and this
was associated with defects in autophagy.

.0002
IMMUNODEFICIENCY, COMMON VARIABLE, 8, WITH AUTOIMMUNITY
LRBA, ARG1683TER

In a boy, born of consanguineous Sicilian parents, with CVID8 with
autoimmunity (614700), Lopez-Herrera et al. (2012) identified a
homozygous 5047C-T transition in exon 30 of the LRBA gene, resulting in
an arg1683-to-ter (R1683X) substitution. No LRBA protein was detected in
patient cells. The mutation was not found in 200 control alleles. Naive
B cells from the patient showed extremely low levels of IgG production
and lymphocyte proliferation when stimulated. Patient cells also showed
increased apoptosis under serum depletion compared to controls, and this
was associated with defects in autophagy.

.0003
IMMUNODEFICIENCY, COMMON VARIABLE, 8, WITH AUTOIMMUNITY
LRBA, GLU59TER

In a boy, born of consanguineous Iranian parents, with CVID8 with
autoimmunity (614700), Lopez-Herrera et al. (2012) identified a
homozygous 175G-T transversion in exon 3 of the LRBA gene, resulting in
a glu59-to-ter (E59X) substitution. The mutation was not found in 233
Iranian controls. Naive B cells from the patient showed low lymphocyte
proliferation when stimulated. Patient cells showed increased areas of
Golgi apparatus and accumulation of autophagosomes, suggesting impaired
autophagy.

In a boy, born of consanguineous Iranian parents, with CVID8 with

homozygous 111.1-kb deletion on chromosome 4q including exons 1 and 2 of
the LRBA gene and about 60 kb upstream and 50 kb downstream of these
exons.

;;BREAST BASIC CONSERVED GENE 1; BBC1;;
D16S444E
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Adams et al. (1992) identified a novel cDNA representing an mRNA showing
significantly higher levels of expression in benign breast lesions than
in carcinomas. In both tissues, expression was highest in epithelial
cells, as determined by in situ hybridization to tissue sections. The
protein deduced from the nucleotide sequence was highly basic with no
signal or transmembrane sequence, but 2 potential nuclear localization
signals. The cDNA hybridized to multiple sequences within both human and
other mammalian genomes and to single genomic sequences in Drosophila,
Physarum, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Thus the cDNA represents a
highly conserved gene sequence. Only 1 major transcript was identified
in human cells, but the existence of several pseudogenes was suspected.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid analyses, Kenmochi et al.
(1998) mapped the RPL13 gene to chromosome 16.

606246	TITLE *606246 JUXTAPOSED WITH ANOTHER ZINC FINGER GENE 1; JAZF1
;;TAK1-INTERACTING PROTEIN 27; TIP27
JAZF1/JJAZ1 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

A variety of cytogenetic abnormalities involving chromosome 7 have been
reported in endometrial stromal sarcomas, including a recurrent
t(7;17)(p15;q21). In cases with this particular translocation, Koontz et
al. (2001) identified 2 zinc finger genes, which they termed JAZF1 and
JJAZ1 (606245), at the sites of the 7p15 and 17q21 breakpoints,
respectively. They obtained a JAZF1 cDNA by database analysis and
screening human brain and umbilical vein endothelial cell cDNA
libraries. The deduced 243-amino acid protein has an N-terminal zinc
finger domain and a nearly tandem pair of zinc finger domains close to
the C terminus.

Using the hinge and ligand-binding domains of TAK1 (NR2C2; 601426) as
bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a testis cDNA library, Nakajima et
al. (2004) cloned human JAZF1, which they called TIP27. The deduced
243-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 27.1 kD. It
has a putative zinc finger motif near the N terminus, followed by a TAK1
interaction domain, a glu/asp-rich stretch, and 2 additional zinc finger
motifs. The second zinc finger contains a putative nuclear localization
signal. Northern blot analysis detected variable expression of a 3.2-kb
TIP27 transcript in all 10 human tissues examined, with highest
expression in testis, followed by colon, ovary, prostate, and placenta.
Expression was lowest in pancreas, brain, and liver. A 0.9-kb TIP27
transcript was also detected in testis. In situ hybridization of testis
revealed expression of TIP27 in pachytene spermatocytes and round
spermatids. Fluorescence-tagged TIP27 colocalized with TAK1 in a
punctate pattern in transfected COS-1 cell nuclei, and both proteins
were excluded from nucleoli. Database analysis revealed orthologs of
TIP27 in mouse and Drosophila.

GENE FUNCTION

Using mammalian 2-hybrid analysis, Nakajima et al. (2004) showed that
TIP27 interacted with TAK1, but not with other nuclear receptors, either
in the presence or absence of their respective ligands. Protein
pull-down and immunoprecipitation analyses confirmed the interaction
between TIP27 and TAK1. Deletion analysis revealed that an N-terminal
domain of TIP27 interacted with a portion of the ligand-binding domain
of TAK1. Mutation analysis showed that tyr60 of TIP27 was crucial for
the interaction. Reporter gene assays revealed that TIP27 repressed TIP1
transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner. TIP27 did not
interfere with TIP1 homodimerization or with binding of TIP1 to DNA,
suggesting that interaction of TIP27 with TAK1 may inhibit recruitment
of a coactivator.

- JAZF1/JJAZ1 Fusion Protein

Koontz et al. (2001) determined that the recurrent t(7;17)(p15;q21) in
endometrial stromal sarcomas fuses the JAZF1 and JJAZ1 genes, resulting
in a chimeric transcript containing the 5-prime end of JAZF1 and the
3-prime end of JJAZ1. Analysis of tumor RNA indicated that a JAZF1/JJAZ1
fusion was present in all types of endometrial stromal tumors; however,
the fusion appeared to be rarer among endometrial stromal sarcomas that
would be considered high-grade according to certain classification
schemes. These findings suggested that the less malignant endometrial
stromal tumors may evolve toward more malignant types, but that some
endometrial stromal sarcomas with relatively abundant mitotic activity
may compose a biologically distinct group.

Li et al. (2007) stated that the first 3 exons of JAZF1 are joined to
the last 15 exons of JJAZ1 in the JAZF1/JJAZ1 fusion transcript. They
found that both benign and malignant forms of endometrial stromal tumors
had the JAZF1/JJAZ1 fusion, but only the malignant form also exhibited
suppression of the unrearranged JJAZ1 allele. Li et al. (2007) found
that suppression of endogenous JJAZ1 in human embryonic kidney cells
reduced the amounts of EZH2 (601573) and total histone-3 (see 602810)
lys27 trimethylation. Introduction of the JAZF1/JJAZ1 chimeric
transcript into the JJAZ1-depleted cells reversed these effects.
Suppression of JJAZ1 also reduced cell proliferation, whereas
JAZF1/JJAZ1 induced above normal proliferation in JJAZ1-depleted cells.
However, in the presence of normal JJAZ1 levels, JAZF1/JJAZ1 decreased
cell proliferation. Expression of JJAZF1/JJAZ1 with or without
suppression of JJAZ1 protected cells from apoptosis caused by serum
deprivation or hypoxia. Li et al. (2007) concluded that progression of a
benign precursor to a sarcoma involves increased cell survival
associated with rearrangement of a Polycomb group gene, such as JJAZ1,
followed by accelerated cellular proliferation upon exclusion of the
unrearranged allele of that gene.

Li et al. (2008) showed that normal endometrial stromal cells contain a
specific chimeric RNA joining 5-prime exons of the JAZF1 gene on
chromosome 7p15 to 3-prime exons of the Polycomb group gene JJAZ1
(606245) on chromosome 17q11 and that this RNA is translated into
JAZF1/JJAZ1, a protein with antiapoptotic activity. The JAZF1/JJAZ1 RNA
appears to arise from physiologically regulated trans-splicing between
precursor mRNAs for JAZF1 and JJAZ1. The chimeric RNA and protein are
identical to those produced from a gene fusion found in human
endometrial stromal tumors. Li et al. (2008) concluded that certain gene
fusions may be proneoplastic owing to constitutive expression of
chimeric gene products normally generated by trans-splicing of RNAs in
developing tissues.

GENE STRUCTURE

Li et al. (2007) stated that the JAZF1 gene contains 5 exons.

By genomic sequence analysis, Koontz et al. (2001) mapped the JAZF1 gene
to chromosome 7p15.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a large genomewide association study of prostate cancer, Thomas et
al. (2008) found association of a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
in the second intron of the JAZF1 gene, dbSNP rs10486567, with prostate
cancer risk (P = 2.14 x 10(-6)).

300393	TITLE *300393 G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR 101; GPR101
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs, or GPRs) contain 7 transmembrane
domains and transduce extracellular signals through heterotrimeric G
proteins.

CLONING

Lee et al. (2001) identified GPR101 within a genomic database using
sequences of the histamine receptor H1 (600167) as query. PCR primers
were designed to amplify and clone GPR101 from a genomic library.
Full-length GPR101 encodes a deduced 508-amino acid protein that shares
approximately 30% sequence identity in the transmembrane regions with
the G protein-coupled receptor RE2, the serotonin 5HT1A receptor (HTR1A;
109760), and the alpha-1A-adrenergic receptor (104221). Northern blot
analysis of human brain tissues revealed expression of 9.5- and 4.2-kb
transcripts in the caudate putamen and hypothalamus. No expression was
detected in cortex, thalamus, hippocampus and pons.

MAPPING

Lee et al. (2001) mapped the GPR101 gene to the X chromosome based on
sequence similarity between the GPR101 sequence and a genomic clone
(GenBank GENBANK AL390879) localized to the X chromosome.

613293	TITLE *613293 SH3 AND PX DOMAINS-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2B; SH3PXD2B
;;TYROSINE KINASE SUBSTRATE WITH 4 SH3 DOMAINS; TKS4;;
KIAA1295
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) obtained a partial SH3PXD2B clone, which
they designated KIAA1295. The transcript contains repetitive elements in
its 3-prime end, and the deduced protein contains putative SH3 domains.
RT-PCR ELISA detected highest expression in ovary, followed by testis,
liver, adult and fetal brain, and all specific adult brain regions
examined. Lower expression was detected in adult heart and lung and
fetal liver, and little to no expression was detected in skeletal
muscle, kidney, pancreas, and spleen.

Using PCR, Buschman et al. (2009) cloned full-length SH3PXD2B, which
they called TKS4, from mouse fibroblast and human brain cDNA libraries.
The deduced human SH3PXD2B protein contains 911 amino acids and has a
calculated molecular mass of 101.6 kD. It has an N-terminal Phox
homology (PX) domain, 4 SRC (190090) homology-3 (SH3) domains, numerous
PxxP motifs, and 3 putative tyrosine phosphorylation motifs.
Quantitative PCR analysis detected highest expression in mouse embryo
samples, with lower and variable expression in all adult mouse tissues
examined.

Mao et al. (2009) noted that the deduced 908-amino acid mouse Sh3pxd2b
protein has a calculated molecular mass of 102 kD and contains an
N-terminal PX domain and 4 SH3 domains. Endogenous Sh3pxd2b localized to
the cytoplasm of mouse fibroblasts, with concentration at podosome
clusters and rosettes. Western blot analysis detected variable
expression of Sh3pxd2b at an apparent molecular mass of 120 kD, with
highest expression in brain, lung, spleen, and stomach, but no
expression in kidney or bone marrow.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Buschman et al. (2009) mapped the human
and mouse SH3PXD2B genes to chromosomes 5 and 11, respectively.

GENE FUNCTION

Buschman et al. (2009) showed that the isolated PX domain of TKS4 bound
phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2) and PtdIns3P. It
also bound more weakly to phosphatidic acid. Knockdown or knockout of
Tks4 in mouse fibroblasts resulted in cells unable to form pseudopods
and with an inhibited ability to degrade a gelatin film, which was due
to reduced pseudopod recruitment of membrane type-1 matrix
metalloproteinase (MMP14; 600754). These functions were rescued by
reintroduction of wildtype Tks4, but not by Tks4 with mutations at the
putative tyrosine phosphorylation sites.

Using a protein pull-down assay, Mao et al. (2009) found that the fourth
SH3 domain of mouse Sh3pxd2b interacted with Adam15 (605548), a
metalloprotease involved in extracellular matrix remodeling. Mao et al.
(2009) hypothesized that Sh3pxd2b may function as an adaptor protein
involved in targeting of Adam15 to podosomes for extracellular matrix
remodeling.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a Lebanese family of Syrian origin with Frank-ter Haar syndrome
(FTHS; 249420), originally reported by Megarbane et al. (1997), Iqbal et
al. (2010) analyzed SNP array data for copy number variation and
identified a homozygous deletion on chromosome 5q in affected
individuals. The smallest interval overlapping a region of shared
homozygosity identified with other FTHS families contained only the
SH3PXD2B gene. Iqbal et al. (2010) screened SH3PXD2B in probands from 12
FTHS families and identified 4 homozygous mutations in 6 families
(613293.0001-613293.0004).

ANIMAL MODEL

Mao et al. (2009) found that mice homozygous for the spontaneous nee
mutation had a normal life span, but they exhibited runted growth,
craniofacial and skeletal abnormalities, ocular anterior segment
dysgenesis, and hearing impairment. Adults also exhibited infertility
and a form of lipodystrophy depleting white adipose tissue. Mao et al.
(2009) identified the nee mutation as a 1-bp deletion in the Sh3pxd2b
gene that was predicted to cause a frameshift and protein truncation,
altering a portion of the third SH3 domain and deleting all of the
fourth SH3 domain. Unlike wildtype Sh3pxd2b, mutant Sh3pxd2b localized
within the nucleus as well as the cytoplasm.

Iqbal et al. (2010) used a gene-trap strategy to generate Sh3pxd2b-null
mice and observed pronounced skeletal, eye, and cardiac abnormalities
that phenocopied the majority of the defects associated with Frank-ter
Haar syndrome (249420).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
FRANK-TER HAAR SYNDROME
SH3PXD2B, 1-BP INS, 147T

In 2 Dutch families with Frank-ter Haar syndrome (249420), including the
family originally described by ter Haar et al. (1982), Iqbal et al.
(2010) identified homozygosity for a 1-bp insertion (147insT) in the
SH3PXD2B gene, predicted to create an immediate stop at that codon
(phe49-to-ter; F49X) within the phox homology (PX) domain. The
unaffected parents from both families were heterozygous carriers of the
mutation, which was not found in at least 50 controls. Immunoblot
analysis showed no TKS4 signal in patient fibroblasts, demonstrating
that Frank-ter Haar syndrome can be caused by homozygous
loss-of-function mutations of SH3PXD2B. Quantitative PCR analysis in
patient fibroblasts showed normal levels of SH3PXD2B transcript, even
though no TKS4 protein was detected, indicating that the premature stop
codon likely results in a truncated unstable protein.

.0002
FRANK-TER HAAR SYNDROME
SH3PXD2B, 1-BP DEL, 969G

In the Turkish family originally reported by Maas et al. (2004) and
another family of Arabic origin with Frank-ter Haar syndrome (249420),
Iqbal et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for a 1-bp deletion
(969delG) in the SH3PXD2B gene, predicted to cause a frameshift followed
by a premature stop codon. The unaffected parents from both families
were heterozygous carriers of the mutation, which was not found in at
least 50 controls.

.0003
FRANK-TER HAAR SYNDROME
SH3PXD2B, ARG43TRP

In a male Turkish patient with Frank-ter Haar syndrome (249420), Iqbal
et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for a 129C-T transition in the
SH3PXD2B gene, resulting in an arg43-to-trp (R43W) substitution at a
highly conserved residue within the phox homology (PX) domain that was
predicted to abolish binding to phosphoinositides. The unaffected
parents were heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found in 210
control chromosomes.

.0004
FRANK-TER HAAR SYNDROME
SH3PXD2B, 76, A-C, -2

In a male Israeli patient with Frank-ter Haar syndrome (249420), Iqbal
et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for a 76-2A-C splice site mutation
in the SH3PXD2B gene, disrupting the strictly conserved adenosine of the
splice acceptor site. The unaffected parents were heterozygous for the
mutation, which was not found in 210 control chromosomes.

603750	TITLE *603750 AQUAPORIN 8; AQP8
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Aquaporins (AQPs) are water channels that are important for the
transport of water through high water-permeable membranes. The aquaporin
family has been divided into 2 groups based on sequence and function.
The first group is water-selective and includes AQP2 (107777) and AQP4
(600308), and the second group is permeable to both water and small
molecules and includes AQP3 (600170) and AQP7 (602974). Using a rat Aqp8
cDNA, Koyama et al. (1998) cloned human AQP8 genomic DNA. They isolated
human testis AQP8 cDNAs using the AQP8 genomic sequence. The predicted
261-amino acid AQP8 protein contains 6 membrane-spanning domains, 2
highly conserved asn-pro-ala (NPA) motifs, and 3 N-linked glycosylation
sites. The human AQP8 protein is 40.4% identical to the plant water
channel gamma-TIP, 76.0% identical to mouse Aqp8, 74.9% identical to rat
Aqp8, 29.5% identical to human AQP2, and 28.9% identical to human AQP3.
Northern blot analysis of human tissues detected a 1.35-kb AQP8 mRNA
only in pancreas and colon. Koyama et al. (1998) demonstrated that human
AQP8 is permeable to water but not to urea or glycerol. They suggested
that AQP8 is a member of a third group of aquaporins.

GENE STRUCTURE

Koyama et al. (1998) determined that, like the genes of
non-water-selective aquaporins, the AQP8 gene contains 6 exons; however,
its exon-intron boundaries are different from the boundaries of those
other aquaporin genes.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis and FISH, Viggiano et al. (1999) mapped
the AQP8 gene to chromosome 16p12. They mapped the mouse ortholog to
chromosome 7F3 in a region showing conserved synteny with human
16p12-p11.2.

609347	TITLE *609347 RECEPTOR EXPRESSION-ENHANCING PROTEIN 2; REEP2
;;SGC32445;;
CHROMOSOME 5 OPEN READING FRAME 19; C5ORF19
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Lai et al. (2001) identified C5ORF19, which they called SGC32445, within
a region of chromosome 5q frequently deleted in malignant myelomas. The
deduced 152-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of about
17 kD. Northern blot analysis detected a transcript of about 2.2 kb.
C5ORF19 expression was abundant in brain, heart, and skeletal muscle,
low in placenta, kidney, and pancreas, and absent in lung and liver.

Transport of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to the cell surface
membrane is critical for receptor-ligand recognition. However, mammalian
GPCR odorant receptors (ORs), when heterologously expressed in cells,
are poorly expressed on the cell surface. By screening for genes that
induced cell surface expression of ORs expressed in human embryonic
kidney cells, Saito et al. (2004) identified mouse and human REEP1
(609139). They searched databases for homologs of REEP1 and identified
several other REEP genes, including REEP2. In situ hybridization of
mouse olfactory epithelium revealed that, unlike Reep1, Reep2 was not
expressed in olfactory neurons.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lai et al. (2001) determined that the C5ORF19 gene contains 8 exons and
spans more than 7 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Lai et al. (2001) mapped the REEP2 gene to
chromosome 5q31.

;;GTP-SPECIFIC SUCCINYL-CoA SYNTHETASE, BETA SUBUNIT;;
G-BETA
DESCRIPTION Succinyl-CoA synthetase (SCS) is composed of an invariant alpha subunit
and a beta subunit that determines whether the enzyme is GTP-specific
(G-SCS; EC 6.2.1.4) or ATP-specific (A-SCS; EC 6.2.1.5). See SUCLA2
(603921). Johnson et al. (1998) identified human and mouse cDNAs
encoding A-beta and G-beta, the beta subunits of A-SCS and G-SCS,
respectively. The predicted 395-amino acid human G-beta protein shares
89 to 94% identity with that of pigeon, mouse, and pig, and 38 to 48%
identity with the beta subunit of bacterial SCSs. Human A-beta and
G-beta are 53% identical. RT-PCR revealed that G-beta is widely
expressed. Although the level of G-beta mRNA appears to be lower than
that of A-beta in most human and mouse tissues, Johnson et al. (1998)
demonstrated that G-SCS was generally the predominant enzyme activity in
rat and mouse tissues.

607189	TITLE *607189 REGULATOR OF G PROTEIN SIGNALING 8; RGS8
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are regulatory and
structural components of G protein-coupled receptor complexes. RGS
proteins are GTPase-activating proteins for Gi (see GNAI1; 139310) and
Gq (see GNAQ; 600998) class G-alpha proteins. They accelerate transit
through the cycle of GTP binding and hydrolysis and thereby accelerate
signaling kinetics and termination.

CLONING

Using a combination of exon trapping, cDNA library screening, and
shotgun sample sequencing, Sood et al. (2001) identified RGS8 within a
prostate cancer susceptibility region on chromosome 1 (HPC1; 601518).
They identified 2 RGS8 splice variants. The shorter variant contains
exons 3 through 7, while the longer variant lacks exon 3. The larger
transcript encodes a deduced 198-amino acid protein. Northern blot
analysis revealed a 6.5-kb transcript expressed only in brain. Dot blot
analysis of mRNA showed expression was stronger in several subregions of
the brain, particularly pons, putamen, thalamus, caudate nucleus, and
cerebellum. Low-level expression was detected in fetal brain, testis,
and thyroid gland.

Saitoh et al. (2002) cloned Rgs8 from a rat brain cDNA library and
identified 2 splice variants, one of which contains an N terminus of 7
amino acids, while the other contains an N terminus of 9 amino acids.

GENE FUNCTION

Saitoh et al. (2002) found that the longer Rgs8 variant in rat
accelerated the cycling of Gi/Go-mediated modulation of G protein-gated
inward-rectifying K(+) channels when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The
longer form also decreased the amplitude of the Gq-coupled response to
activation of M1 muscarinic receptor (CHRM1; 118510) or substance P
receptor (TACR1; 162323), but did not inhibit signaling from the M3
muscarinic receptor (CHRM3; 118494). The shorter variant showed weakened
modulation of Gi/o- and Gq-coupled signaling in all assays.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sood et al. (2001) determined that the RGS8 gene contains 7 exons.
Sierra et al. (2002), however, determined that RGS8 contains 6 exons and
spans more than 26 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Sierra et al. (2002) mapped the RGS8 gene
to chromosome 1q25.3. They mapped the mouse Rgs8 gene to chromosome 1 by
interspecific backcross mapping.

609557	TITLE *609557 PROLYL ENDOPEPTIDASE-LIKE; PREPL
;;KIAA0436
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PREPL belongs to the prolyl oligopeptidase subfamily of serine
peptidases (Parvari et al., 2005).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Ishikawa et al. (1997) cloned PREPL, which they designated
KIAA0436. The deduced 689-amino acid protein had an apparent molecular
mass of 72 kD by SDS-PAGE. RT-PCR detected high expression in all
tissues examined except spleen, where expression was low.

Parvari et al. (2001) identified PREPL as one of the genes affected by a
homozygous deletion of 179 kb on chromosome 2, which results in the 2p21
deletion syndrome (606407). By EST database analysis, Parvari et al.
(2005) identified 9 PREPL splice variants predicted to produce 4
different proteins. The longest deduced protein contains 727 amino acids
and has a propeller domain in its N-terminal half and a catalytic
domain, including the catalytic triad (ser, asp, his) essential for
serine peptidases, in its C-terminal half. EST database analysis and
RT-PCR showed tissue-specific expression of each PREPL variant.

GENE FUNCTION

PREPL is localized in the cytosol and shows homology with prolyl
endopeptidase (PREP; 600400) and oligopeptidase B (EC 3.4.21.83). Jaeken
et al. (2006) found that substitution of the predicted catalytic
residues (ser470, asp556, and his601) by alanines resulted in loss of
reactivity with a serine hydrolase-specific probe. In sharp contrast to
PREP and oligopeptidase B, which require both amino- and
carboxy-terminal sequences for activity, PREPL activity appeared to
depend only on the carboxy-terminal domain. Jaeken et al. (2006)
concluded that PREPL is a novel oligopeptidase with unique structural
and functional characteristics.

GENE STRUCTURE

Parvari et al. (2005) determined that the PREPL gene contains 14 coding
exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1997) mapped the PREPL
gene to chromosome 2.

By genomic sequence analysis, Parvari et al. (2001) mapped the PREPL
gene to chromosome 2p16. Parvari et al. (2005) refined the mapping to
chromosome 2p21.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Parvari et al. (2001, 2005) identified PREPL as one of the genes deleted
in the homozygous 2p21 deletion syndrome (606407).

Jaeken et al. (2006) studied 11 patients with the hypotonia-cystinuria
syndrome, also known as the 2p21 deletion syndrome. They found
microdeletion of part of the SLC3A1 (104614) and PREPL genes on 2p21.
Since loss-of-function mutations in SLC3A1 were known to cause isolated
cystinuria type I (220100), and since the expression of the flanking
genes, C2orf34 (609559) and PPM1B (603770), was normal, the extended
phenotype could be attributed to deletion of PREPL.

115440	TITLE *115440 CASEIN KINASE II, ALPHA-1; CSNK2A1
;;CASEIN KINASE II, ALPHA SUBUNIT; CK2A1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Casein kinase II is a serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates acidic
protein such as casein. It has a tetrameric a(2)/b(2) structure. The
alpha subunit of molecular mass 40 kD possesses catalytic activity,
whereas the beta subunit (115441), molecular mass 25 kD, is
autophosphorylated in vitro. Meisner et al. (1989) reported the
identification and nucleotide sequencing of a complete human cDNA for
the alpha subunit. Using the full-length cDNA probe, Meisner et al.
(1989) found 2 bands with restriction enzymes that have no recognition
sites within the cDNA and 3 to 6 bands with enzymes having single
internal sites. These results were considered consistent with the
existence of 2 genes encoding alpha subunits. See 115442.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wirkner et al. (1994) demonstrated that the CSNK2A1 gene contains 8
exons whose sequences comprise bases 102 to 824 of the coding region of
the human casein kinase II alpha subunit. Three of the 9 introns are
located at positions corresponding to those of the homologous gene in
the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The introns contain 8 complete and
8 incomplete Alu repeats.

GENE FUNCTION

Phosphorylation of the human p53 protein (191170) at ser392 is
responsive to ultraviolet (UV) but not gamma irradiation. Keller et al.
(2001) identified and purified a mammalian UV-activated protein kinase
complex that phosphorylates ser392 in vitro. This kinase complex
contains CK2 and the chromatin transcriptional elongation factor FACT, a
heterodimer of SPT16 (605012) and SSRP1 (604328). In vitro studies
showed that FACT alters the specificity of CK2 in the complex such that
it selectively phosphorylates p53 over other substrates, including
casein. In addition, phosphorylation by the kinase complex was found to
enhance p53 activity. These results provided a potential mechanism for
p53 activation by UV irradiation.

Doray et al. (2002) demonstrated that the Golgi-localized,
gamma-ear-containing adenosine diphosphate ribosylation factor-binding
proteins (GGA1, 606004 and GGA3, 606006) and the coat protein adaptor
protein-1 (AP-1) complex (see AP1G2, 603534) colocalize in
clathrin-coated buds of the trans-Golgi networks of mouse L cells and
human HeLa cells. Binding studies revealed a direct interaction between
the hinge domains of the GGAs and the gamma-ear domain of AP-1. Further,
AP-1 contained bound casein kinase-2 that phosphorylated GGA1 and GGA3,
thereby causing autoinhibition. Doray et al. (2002) demonstrated that
this autoinhibition could induce the directed transfer of mannose
6-phosphate receptors (see 154540) from the GGAs to AP-1. Mannose
6-phosphate receptors that were defective in binding to GGAs were poorly
incorporated into adaptor protein complex containing clathrin coated
vesicles. Thus, Doray et al. (2002) concluded that GGAs and the AP-1
complex interact to package mannose 6-phosphate receptors into
AP-1-containing coated vesicles.

Lin et al. (2002) identified a Drosophila circadian mutant, Timekeeper
(Tik), that behaved in a dominant manner. Tik homozygotes do not live to
adulthood, and heterozygotes have a circadian rhythm lengthened by about
3 hours. Lin et al. (2002) showed that the catalytic subunit of
Drosophila casein kinase-2 (CK2-alpha) is expressed predominantly in the
cytoplasm of key circadian pacemaker neurons. CK2-alpha mutant flies
showed lengthened circadian period, decreased CK2 activity, and delayed
nuclear entry of Per (see 602260). Lin et al. (2002) suggested that
these are probably direct, as CK2-alpha specifically phosphorylates Per
in vitro. Lin et al. (2002) proposed that CK2 is an evolutionary link
between the divergent circadian systems of animals, plants, and fungi.

Loizou et al. (2004) showed that CK2 phosphorylates the scaffold protein
XRCC1 (194360) and thereby enables the assembly and activity of DNA
single-strand break repair protein complexes in vitro and at sites of
chromosome breakage. Inhibition of XRCC1 phosphorylation by mutation of
the CK2 phosphorylation sites or by preventing CK2 activity using a
highly specific inhibitor ablated the rapid repair of cellular DNA
single-strand breaks by XRCC1. These data identified a direct role for
CK2 in the repair of chromosome DNA strand breaks and in maintaining
genetic integrity.

Downstream core promoter elements (DPE) are regulatory sequences that
add diversity to the promoter architecture of RNA polymerase
II-transcribed genes. Despite a functional correlation between the
presence of TFIID (313650) and DPE, Lewis et al. (2005) found that TFIID
was insufficient for DPE-specific transcription in HeLa cells. Using a
functional transcription assay coupled with conventional biochemistry,
they found that protein kinase CK2, in conjunction with the coactivator
PC4 (600503), established DPE-specific transcription.

MAPPING

By segregation analysis of rodent-human somatic cell hybrids and
chromosomal in situ hybridization, Yang-Feng et al. (1991) identified 2
loci for the alpha subunit of casein kinase II: 11p15.5-p.15.4 and
20p13. Whether one of these is a pseudogene remained to be determined.
Boldyreff et al. (1992) likewise found 2 assignments by in situ
hybridization: 11pter-p15.1 and 20p13. Only the locus on chromosome 11
was confirmed by somatic cell hybrid analysis, based on the presence of
a CK2A1-specific 20-kb fragment. However, Wirkner et al. (1992)
demonstrated that the sequence that maps to 11p15 by in situ
hybridization has the characteristics of a processed pseudogene.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization using an 18.9-kb genomic clone
representing the central portion of the gene, Wirkner et al. (1994)
mapped CSNK2A1 to 20p13. Using the genomic clone, no hybridization
signal was obtained in 11p15 as had previously been the case when the
cDNA was used as probe (Yang-Feng et al., 1991).
