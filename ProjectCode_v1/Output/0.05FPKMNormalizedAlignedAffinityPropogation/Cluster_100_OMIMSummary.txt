DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2001) cloned KIAA1840. The deduced protein
contains 1,437 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA detected moderate expression in
all tissues and specific brain regions examined, with highest expression
in liver, followed by brain and ovary.

Stevanin et al. (2007) demonstrated that the full-length 8-kb SPG11
transcript encodes a predicted protein of 2,443 amino acids, which they
termed spatacsin, after 'spasticity with thin or atrophied corpus
callosum syndrome protein.' Human SPG11 shares 85% identity with the
homologous protein in dog, 76% with mouse, and 73% with rat. The
spatacsin protein includes 4 putative transmembrane domains, suggesting
that the protein may be a receptor or transporter, as well as a leucine
zipper and coiled-coil domain. It was assigned to the aromatic compound
dioxygenase superfamily because of 22% identity with the consensus
sequence between residues 2104 and 2381. The SPG11 gene is expressed
ubiquitously in the nervous system but most prominently in the
cerebellum, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and pineal gland.
Overexpression of a GFP fusion protein in COS-7 cells demonstrated a
diffuse and reticular cytosolic and perinuclear distribution, sometimes
also present in nuclei. At least 3 alternative transcripts were detected
in all structures of adult brain. mRNA in situ hybridization in rat
brain detected no expression in newborn rat, but found expression
throughout the brain in adult rat.

GENE STRUCTURE

Stevanin et al. (2007) determined that the SPG11 gene comprises 40 exons
and spans 101 kb.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the
KIAA1840 gene to chromosome 15 (TMAP SGC33828). Stevanin et al. (2007)
mapped the SPG11 gene to chromosome 15q21.1 by genomic sequence
analysis.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoprecipitation analysis of HeLa cells, Slabicki et al. (2010)
showed that KIAA0415 (613653) exists in a core protein complex
containing SPG11, SPG15 (270700), C20ORF29 (AP5S1; 614824), and
DKFZp761E198 (614367). Knockdown of KIAA0415, C20ORF29, or SPG15 in HeLa
cells reduced homologous recombination in a test substrate, whereas
knockdown of SPG11 or DKFZp761E198 had no effect.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 11 families with autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia
with thin corpus callosum (SPG11; 604360), Stevanin et al. (2007) found
10 different mutations in the spatacsin gene. The mutations were either
nonsense or insertions or deletions leading to a frameshift, suggesting
a loss-of-function mechanism.

Del Bo et al. (2007) identified a homozygous mutation in the SPG11 gene
(733delAT; 610844.0004) in 27-year-old Italian opposite-sex dizygotic
twins with autosomal recessive SPG11.

In 9 unrelated families with SPG11, Hehr et al. (2007) identified 11
different mutations, including 10 novel mutations, in the SPG11 gene
(see, e.g., 610844.0005-610844.0006) in the homozygous or compound
heterozygous state. Four of the families were consanguineous, including
3 Turkish families initially reported by Olmez et al. (2006). Mutations
were distributed throughout the entire spatacsin gene without obvious
clustering.

Bauer et al. (2009) used high-resolution comparative genomic
hybridization (HRCGH) to identify deletions in the SPG11 gene in 3
patients with SPG11 in whom only 1 mutant SPG11 allele had been
identified by gene sequencing. HRCGH analysis suggested heterozygous
genomic deletion in all 3 patients; however, quantitative PCR confirmed
an 8.23-kb deletion in only 1 patient. The 8.23-kb deletion resulted in
loss of exons 31 to 34 and was also found in the proband's affected
sister and their unaffected father. The clinical features in the brother
and sister did not differ from those of patients with point mutations.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 11, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
SPG11, ARG2034TER

In 3 consanguineous North African kindreds, Stevanin et al. (2007) found
that a homozygous 6100C-T transition in exon 32 of the SPG11 gene,
resulting in an arg2034-to-stop substitution (R2034X), segregated with
spastic paraplegia with thin corpus callosum (604360). If not rapidly
degraded, the predicted protein would be truncated by 27% of its normal
size.

Boukhris et al. (2008) identified a homozygous R2034X mutation in
affected members of 2 Tunisian families of Arab origin with SPG11.

.0002
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 11, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
SPG11, 5-BP DEL, 529ATATT

In 2 Portuguese families, Stevanin et al. (2007) found that a 5-bp
deletion in exon 3 of the SPG11 gene, 529_533delATATT, in homozygosity
segregated with spastic paraplegia with thin corpus callosum (604360).
The mutation was predicted to lead to a frameshift with early
termination at amino acid residue 179 (I177_I178delfsX).

.0003
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 11, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
SPG11, 118C-T, GLN40TER

In a brother and sister from a consanguineous Israeli family, Stevanin
et al. (2007) found that spastic paraplegia with thin corpus callosum
(604360) was associated with a homozygous 118C-T transition in exon 1 of
the SPG11 gene that resulted in premature termination of the protein at
gln40 (Q40X).

.0004
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 11, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
SPG11, 2-BP DEL, 733AT

In 27-year-old Italian opposite-sex dizygotic twins with autosomal
recessive SPG11 (604360), Del Bo et al. (2007) identified a homozygous
2-bp deletion (733delAT) in exon 4 of the SPG11 gene, resulting in a
frameshift and premature termination at codon 247. The sibs had onset of
ataxia and cognitive impairment at ages 12 and 15 years, respectively.
The disorder progressed rapidly, leading to spastic paraplegia,
dysarthria, and peripheral neuropathy. Both were wheelchair-bound in
their early twenties. Brain MRI showed thin corpus callosum and cortical
atrophy in both sibs. Both parents were healthy and came from the same
small town in Sicily but denied consanguinity.

In a Spanish patient with SPG11, Hehr et al. (2007) identified compound
heterozygosity for the 733delAT mutation and 1-bp insertion (2472insT;
610844.0005) of exon 14 of the SPG11 gene, resulting in frameshift and
premature termination.

Boukhris et al. (2008) identified a homozygous 733delAT mutation in
affected members of 3 Tunisian families of Arab origin with SPG11.

SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 11, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
SPG11, IVS2DS, G-C, +1

In affected members of a consanguineous Turkish family with SPG11
(604360), Hehr et al. (2007) identified a homozygous G-to-C transversion
in the donor splice site of intron 2 of the SPG11 gene. The family had
been previously reported by Olmez et al. (2006).

.0007
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 11, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
SPG11, IVS39AS, G-C, -1

In a 48-year-old Swedish patient with SPG11 and central retinal
dystrophy (604360), Orlen et al. (2009) identified a homozygous G-to-C
transversion in intron 39 (7152-1G-C) of the SPG11 gene, resulting in
loss of the splice acceptor site and predicting a loss of function. An
unrelated 41-year-old Swedish patient with SPG11 had the splice site
mutation in compound heterozygosity with a 5623C-T transition in exon 30
of the SPG11 gene, resulting in a gln1875-to-ter (Q1875X; 610844.0008)
substitution. Haplotype analysis indicated a founder effect for
7152-1G-C mutation, which was found in 2 (1.8%) of 216 Swedish control
chromosomes. Both patients were wheelchair-bound due to lower limb
spasticity, had amyotrophy of the hands, sphincter disturbances, thin
corpus callosum, and late-onset progressive central retinal
degeneration.

SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 11, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
SPG11, 1-BP DUP, 3067A

In 2 sibs, born of consanguineous Iranian parents, with SPG11 (604360),
Orlen et al. (2009) identified a homozygous 1-bp duplication (3067dupA)
in exon 17 of the SPG11 gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature
termination. The patients were 14 and 29 years old, respectively, at the
time of the report. Both had onset at age 3 to 4 years, but the younger
brother had a milder phenotype. The older sister was wheelchair-bound
due to lower limb spasticity, had amyotrophy of the hands, learning
disability, thin corpus callosum, and central retinal degeneration.
