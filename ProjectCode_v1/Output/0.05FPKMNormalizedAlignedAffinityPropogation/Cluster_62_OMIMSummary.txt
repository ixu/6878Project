;;ITRPK1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Based on a bovine peptide sequence, Wilson and Majerus (1996) found a
human EST corresponding to the inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate 5/6-kinase
gene (ITRPK1). They used this EST to clone the cDNA of ITRPK1 from a
human fetal brain cDNA library. This cDNA encodes a 414-amino acid
polypeptide. Northern blot analysis revealed that ITRPK1 was expressed
as a 3.6-kb message in all tissues tested, with the highest levels in
brain. Expression of the cDNA resulted in inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate
5/6-kinase activity, showing that a single kinase phosphorylates
inositol in both the D5 and D6 positions.

By database searching with the ITPK1 sequence to identify an enzyme with
1-kinase activity, Yang and Shears (2000) also obtained a cDNA encoding
ITPK1 but with a serine replacing asparagine-356. Functional analysis
showed that the variant, which they called the type beta protein, as
well as the protein with asn356, which they called the type alpha
protein, phosphorylated not only the 5- and 6-hydroxy groups of
Ins(1,3,4)P3 but also the 1-hydroxy group of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4, suggesting
that the 2 inositol phosphates compete for phosphorylation in vivo. Yang
and Shears (2000) concluded that the same kinase is charged with
performing competing activities that both activate and deactivate a
signaling pathway.

610855	TITLE *610855 ANKYRIN REPEAT DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 26; ANKRD26
;;KIAA1074
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Kikuno et al. (1999) cloned ANKRD26, which they designated
KIAA1074. The deduced protein contains 1,709 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected moderate expression in fetal liver and in nearly all adult
tissues and specific brain regions examined. Low expression was detected
in adult pancreas and spleen and in fetal brain.

By database analysis, Hahn et al. (2006) identified ANKRD26 as a distant
homolog of the POTE family (see POTE2; 608914). The ANKRD26 protein
contains 4 N-terminal ankyrin repeats and a C-terminal coiled-coil
region. It shares 61.2% amino acid identity with mouse Ankrd26.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hahn et al. (2006) determined that the ANKRD26 gene contains 34 exons.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Kikuno et al. (1999) mapped the ANKRD26
gene to chromosome 10. By genomic sequence analysis, Hahn et al. (2006)
mapped the ANKRD26 gene to chromosome 10p12.1. They mapped the mouse
Ankrd26 gene to chromosome 6F1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 9 of 20 unrelated families with autosomal dominant nonsyndromic
thrombocytopenia-2 (THC2; 188000), Pippucci et al. (2011) identified 6
different heterozygous mutations in the 5-prime promoter region of the
ANKRD26 gene (see, e.g., 610855.0001-610855.0003). All of the mutations
occurred in a highly conserved 19-nucleotide stretch. In vitro
functional expression assays in Dami human megakaryoblastic cells
indicated that the mutations resulted in increased expression,
particularly when the cells were stimulated toward maturation. The
findings suggested a gain-of-function effect. Pippucci et al. (2011)
speculated that the ANKRD26 mutations interfere with the mechanism
controlling the expression of ANKRD26, which would then affect
megakaryopoiesis and platelet production, perhaps by inducing apoptosis.
The phenotype was characterized by thrombocytopenia without any
morphologic or functional platelet defect.

ANIMAL MODEL

Bera et al. (2008) generated mice homozygous for partial inactivation of
the Ankrd26 gene and observed the development of extreme obesity,
insulin resistance, and a dramatic increase in body size. The obesity
was associated with hyperphagia with no reduction in energy expenditure
or activity. Bera et al. (2008) detected expression of Ankrd26 in the
arcuate and ventromedial nuclei within the hypothalamus and in the
ependyma and the circumventricular organs that act as an interface
between the peripheral circulation and the brain. They also found
increased phosphorylation of Akt (see AKT1; 164730) and mTOR (FRAP1;
601231) in mutant hearts compared to wildtype.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
THROMBOCYTOPENIA 2
ANKRD26, -134G-A

In 7 affected members of a large Italian family with autosomal dominant
thrombocytopenia-2 (THC2; 188000) originally reported by Savoia et al.
(1999), Pippucci et al. (2011) identified a heterozygous -134G-A
transition in the 5-prime promoter region of the ANKRD26 gene. The same
mutation was also identified in 2 members of a second Italian family
with the disorder. The mutation was not found in 500 controls. In vitro
functional expression studies of the mutant protein in K562
undifferentiated myeloid cells showed 2.7 to 4.5-fold increased
expression of a luciferase reporter. Transfection of the -134G-A
mutation in Dami human megakaryoblastic cells showed overexpression of
the reporter gene in cells that were both unstimulated and stimulated
toward megakaryocytic maturation. Punzo et al. (2010) determined that
this large Italian family, originally reported by Savoia et al. (1999),
had a pathogenic mutation in the ACBD5 gene that caused the disorder,
but the findings of Pippucci et al. (2011) suggested that the ANKRD26
mutation was responsible for the phenotype.

.0002
THROMBOCYTOPENIA 2
ANKRD26, -127A-T

In 6 affected members of a large Italian family with autosomal dominant
thrombocytopenia-2 (THC2; 188000), Pippucci et al. (2011) identified a
heterozygous -127A-T transversion in the 5-prime promoter region of the
ANKRD26 gene. The same mutation was also identified in 2 members of
family from Argentina with the disorder. The mutation was not found in
500 controls. Transfection of the -127A-T mutation in Dami human
megakaryoblastic cells showed overexpression of the reporter gene in
Dami cells that were stimulated toward megakaryocytic maturation, but
not in unstimulated cells.

.0003
THROMBOCYTOPENIA 2
ANKRD26, -128G-A

In 7 affected members of a large Italian family with autosomal dominant
thrombocytopenia-2 (THC2; 188000), Pippucci et al. (2011) identified a
heterozygous -128G-A transition in the 5-prime promoter region of the
ANKRD26 gene. The same mutation was also identified in 3 members of
another Italian family with the disorder. The mutation was not found in
500 controls. Transfection of the -128G-A mutation in Dami human
megakaryoblastic cells showed overexpression of the reporter gene in
cells that were both unstimulated and stimulated toward megakaryocytic
maturation.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Hu et al. (2005) identified NSMCE4A, which is the human ortholog of S.
cerevisiae Nse4. The deduced 385-amino acid protein shares 22%
similarity with yeast Nse4.

GENE FUNCTION

Hu et al. (2005) showed that S. cerevisiae Nse4 mutants exhibited growth
arrest occurring after S phase and prior to mitosis in a Rad24
checkpoint-dependent manner, and displayed genome instability and
sensitivity to DNA damage agents. Hu et al. (2005) showed that Nse4 is a
non-SMC element of the Smc5 (609386)/Smc6 (609387) DNA repair complex.

600194	TITLE *600194 KERATIN 2; KRT2
;;KERATIN 2A; KRT2A;;
KERATIN 2e; KRT2E
DESCRIPTION 
GENE FAMILY

Keratins are the major gene product of keratinocytes and form the
intermediate filament cytoskeletal network in these cells. Intermediate
filament proteins consist of a central alpha-helical rod domain flanked
by nonhelical sequences of varying size and composition. Keratin
proteins fall into 2 classes on the basis of their electrophoretic
properties and sequence similarities. One member of each class is
required to form the heterodimeric coiled-coil precursor which through
both lateral and longitudinal associations form the mature keratin
intermediate filament. The major epidermal keratins of the type I class
are KRT9 (607606), KRT10 (148080), KRT14 (148066), and KRT16 (148067);
the major epidermal keratins of the type II class are KRT1 (139350),
KRT2, KRT5 (148040), KRT6A (148041), and KRT6B (148042). The expression
of individual keratins is specific both for body site and for stage of
differentiation of the epidermal keratinocyte. Keratinocytes in the
basal layer express KRT5 and KRT14. Upon differentiation and migration
to the spinous layer, these genes are downregulated and the expression
of KRT1 and KRT10 is induced. In cells of the upper spinous layer, KRT2
and KRT9 are expressed. Although the expression of KRT9 is limited to
palmoplantar epidermis, KRT2 is expressed not only in this tissue but
also in other regions, notably the epidermis covering the knee, thigh,
and groin. It is not known whether these keratins simply replace their
respective type I or type II counterpart in the preexisting KRT1/KRT10
network or dimerize with another, as yet undiscovered keratin partner.
The other major epidermal keratins, KRT6 and KRT16, are normally
expressed in the outer root sheath of the hair follicle and in
palmoplantar epidermis.

CLONING

Keratin 2e is a protein of molecular weight 65.8 kD encoded by a 2.6-kb
mRNA species. Collin et al. (1992) determined the sequence of the KRT2e
cDNA.

GENE STRUCTURE

Smith et al. (1998) determined the genomic organization and complete
sequence of the KRT2 gene, which consists of 9 exons spanning 7,634 bp
of DNA.

MAPPING

Presumably the KRT2 gene maps to 12q11-q13, the site of the other class
II genes, such as KRT1 and KRT5. By high-resolution radiation hybrid
mapping, Smith et al. (1998) localized the gene to the interval between
microsatellite markers D12S368 and a specific CHLC marker.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Mutations in the basal cell-specific keratins KRT5 and KRT14 are found
in patients with epidermolysis bullosa simplex (e.g., 131900); mutations
in the differentiation-specific keratins KRT1 and KRT10 have been found
in patients with epidermolytic hyperkeratosis (113800); and mutations in
the palmoplantar-specific keratin KRT9 have been found in patients with
epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma (144200). Rothnagel et al. (1994)
and McLean et al. (1994) demonstrated mutations in the KRT2 gene in
patients with ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens (IBS; 146800). Kremer et al.
(1994) also found mutations in the KRT2 gene in patients with IBS and in
patients with a phenotypically related, if not identical, disorder,
ichthyosis exfoliativa.

Smith et al. (1998) detected several intragenic polymorphisms in the
KRT2 gene, including an 18-bp duplication in exon 1, corresponding to
the V1 domain of the K2e polypeptide. Two novel mutations, N192Y in the
1A domain and E482K in the 2B domain of K2e, were found in families with
IBS.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ICHTHYOSIS BULLOSA OF SIEMENS
KRT2, GLU493ASP

In an Asian family with ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens (146800;
originally diagnosed as epidermolytic hyperkeratosis), Rothnagel et al.
(1994) identified a G-to-T transversion at basepair 1512 of the
published sequence (Collin et al., 1992) of the KRT2 gene, resulting in
a glutamic acid to aspartic acid substitution at residue 117 in the
highly conserved C terminal of the rod domain. (According to Rothnagel
et al. (1994), the residue designated 117 corresponds to codon 493 of
the published sequence.)

.0002
ICHTHYOSIS BULLOSA OF SIEMENS
ICHTHYOSIS EXFOLIATIVA, INCLUDED
KRT2, GLU493LYS

In 4 families with autosomal dominant inheritance of ichthyosis bullosa
of Siemens (146800) and in 1 sporadic case of this disorder, Rothnagel
et al. (1994) found a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 1510 resulting in
a lysine for glutamic acid substitution at residue 117 of the KRT2
protein. Thus in a total of 6 instances, the mutation occurred in the
same codon, GAG (glu); the mutation was to GAT in 1 family and to AAG in
the 5 others. (According to Rothnagel et al. (1994), the residue
designated 117 corresponds to codon 493 of the published sequence.)

In 2 unrelated British families with ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens,
McLean et al. (1994) found a glu493-to-lys mutation in the highly
conserved LLEGEE helix termination motif, producing a change to LLEGKE.
The mutation was predicted to be highly detrimental to keratin filament
assembly and/or functional integrity. A G-to-A transition at nucleotide
1510 of the cDNA sequence occurred in a CpG dinucleotide.

Kremer et al. (1994) identified the same mutation in a family described
as having ichthyosis exfoliativa and in yet another Dutch family with
ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens.

In a large family with ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens in 8 members
spanning 3 generations, Basarab et al. (1999) identified the E493K
mutation in the KRT2 gene. The patients showed blistering, superficial
peeling of the skin, and localized lichenified hyperkeratosis, mainly
confined to the limbs. Phenotypic variation with some individuals
exhibiting unusual clinical features was also observed. The index
patient was erythrodermic at birth and subsequently developed a
widespread pustular eruption. She also had hypertrichosis of the limbs,
as did an affected female first cousin. Basarab et al. (1999) found that
E493K is by far the most frequent mutation in this disorder.

.0003
ICHTHYOSIS BULLOSA OF SIEMENS
KRT2, GLN187PRO

In a Dutch family with ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens (146800), Kremer et
al. (1994) found a heterozygous transversion of adenosine to cytosine at
nucleotide 593. This transversion led to the substitution of a proline
for a glutamine at codon 187 (numbering according to Collin et al.
(1992)) of the predicted protein sequence.

.0004
ICHTHYOSIS BULLOSA OF SIEMENS
KRT2, THR485PRO

In a 4-year-old Korean boy, Yang et al. (1997) observed a sporadic case
of ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens (146800) and demonstrated a
thr485-to-pro amino acid substitution in the highly conserved consensus
motif at the end of the 2-B rod domain segment of the keratin 2 chain.
The disease phenotype was consistent with the inappropriate substitution
of proline near the end of the rod domain, because it was situated near
the predicted molecular overlap region of coiled-coil molecules, which
is critical for the maintenance of the structural integrity of keratin
intermediate filaments. The patient had brownish, wrinkled, and
encrusted hyperkeratosis and blistering over the entirety of his trunk
and limbs, especially on flexural areas, beginning at the age of 100
days. Blistering was more pronounced during summer and could be provoked
by mild trauma. Erythroderma had never been present. Light microscopic
examination showed epidermolytic hyperkeratosis limited to the upper
part of the epidermis.

.0005
ICHTHYOSIS BULLOSA OF SIEMENS
KRT2, ASN192TYR

In a family with ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens (146800), Smith et al.
(1998) identified an asn192-to-tyr substitution in the KRT2 gene.

.0006
ICHTHYOSIS BULLOSA OF SIEMENS
KRT2, GLU482LYS

In a family with ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens (146800), Smith et al.
(1998) identified a glu482-to-lys substitution in the KRT2 gene.

.0007
ICHTHYOSIS BULLOSA OF SIEMENS
KRT2, ASN192ASP

In a family with ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens (146800), Takizawa et al.
(2000) identified an A-to-G transition at nucleotide position 607 of the
KRT2 gene, resulting in an asn192-to-asp substitution.

.0008
ICHTHYOSIS BULLOSA OF SIEMENS
KRT2, ASN192LYS

In a patient with ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens (146800), Whittock et
al. (2001) reported a heterozygous C-to-A transversion at nucleotide 576
of the KRT2 gene that resulted in an asn192-to-lys (N192K) amino acid
substitution in the conserved 1A helix initiation peptide.

103020	TITLE *103020 ADENYLATE KINASE 2; AK2
;;ADENYLATE KINASE, MITOCHONDRIAL MYOKINASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Nucleoside monophosphate kinases, including adenylate kinases, catalyze
the reversible phosphorylation between nucleoside triphosphates and
monophosphates.

CLONING

Bruns and Regina (1977) analyzed the subcellular compartmentalization of
adenylate kinase-2 (EC 2.7.4.3) in HeLa cells, mouse RAG cells, and
RAG-human hybrids expressing human AK2. The results indicated that AK2
is a mitochondrial enzyme.

Noma et al. (1998) isolated cDNAs encoding human adenylate kinase-2 from
a HeLa cell cDNA library, using bovine AK2 cDNA as probe. Two
transcripts were identified: one, designated AK2A, encodes a deduced
239-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 26.5 kD, and
the other, designated AK2B, encodes a deduced 232-amino acid protein
with a predicted molecular mass of 25.6 kD. Northern blot analysis
demonstrated 3 strong hybridizing signals of 0.9 (AK2A), 1.7 (AK2B), and
3.5 kb, with high expression in liver, heart, skeletal muscle, and
pancreas, moderate expression in kidney, placenta, and brain, and weak
expression in lung. However, Western blot analysis showed high levels of
AK2 protein in liver, heart, and kidney, low levels in lung, and
undetectable levels in brain and skeletal muscle.

MAPPING

The existence of a second adenylate kinase locus linked to PGM1 and
peptidase C, i.e., on chromosome 1, was suggested by cell hybridization
studies by Van Cong et al. (1972). The Goss-Harris method of mapping
combines features of recombinational study in families and synteny tests
in hybrid cells. As applied to chromosome 1, the method shows that AK2
and UMPK are distal to PGM1 and that the order of the loci is PGM1:
UMPK: (AK2, alpha-FUC): ENO1 (Goss and Harris, 1977). Carritt et al.
(1982) presented evidence that AK2 is in 1p34.

GENE FUNCTION

Lee et al. (2007) showed that intrinsic apoptosis in human cells that
was induced by the chemotherapeutic agent etoposide or the antibiotic
staurosporine, but not by FAS ligand (TNFSF6; 134638) or TRAIL (TNFSF10;
603598), caused translocation of AK2 from mitochondria to the cytoplasm,
followed by formation of a complex between AK2, FADD (602457), and
CASP10 (601762). Yeast 2-hybrid analysis, protein pull-down assays, and
immunoprecipitation analysis showed that the N- and C-terminal domains
of AK2, which include nucleoside- and substrate-binding domains,
respectively, bound the C-terminal death domain of FADD. AK2 binding
promoted association of CASP10 with FADD, and addition of purified AK2
protein to cell extracts induced activation of CASP10 via FADD, leading
to subsequent activation of CASP9 (602234) and CASP3 (600636). Apoptosis
through the AK2 complex did not correlate with the adenylate kinase
activity of AK2, did not require CASP8 (601763)-mediated apoptotic
responses, and did not involve mitochondrial cytochrome c release.
Immunodepletion or knockdown of AK2, FADD, or CASP10 abrogated
etoposide-induced apoptosis, and AK2 complexes were not observed in
several etoposide-resistant human tumor cell lines that were deficient
in expression of FADD, CASP10, or CASP3. In contrast to the findings in
human cells, etoposide-induced apoptosis was observed in mouse embryonic
fibroblasts that lacked Fadd expression. Since mice also lack Casp10,
Lee et al. (2007) concluded that mice lack an apoptotic pathway
comparable to the AK2-FADD-CASP10 pathway in humans.

Pannicke et al. (2009) showed that knockdown of zebrafish ak2 also leads
to aberrant leukocyte development, demonstrating the evolutionarily
conserved role of AK2. They concluded that their results provide in vivo
evidence for AK2 selectivity in leukocyte differentiation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 6 affected individuals from 5 families segregating reticular
dysgenesis (267500), Pannicke et al. (2009) identified 6 causative
mutations in homozygous or compound heterozygous state
(103020.0001-103020.0006).

Lagresle-Peyrou et al. (2009) identified biallelic mutations in AK2
(103020.0007-103020.0013) in 7 individuals with reticular dysgenesis.
These mutations resulted in absent or strongly decreased protein
expression. The authors then demonstrated that restoration of AK2
expression in the bone marrow cells of individuals with reticular
dysgenesis overcomes the neutrophil differentiation arrest, underlining
its specific requirement in the development of a restricted set of
hematopoietic lineages. Finally, Lagresle-Peyrou et al. (2009)
established that AK2 is specifically expressed in the stria vascularis
region of the inner ear, which provides an explanation for the
sensorineural deafness in these individuals. Lagresle-Peyrou et al.
(2009) concluded that their results identified a previously unknown
mechanism involved in regulation of hematopoietic cell differentiation
in one of the most severe human immunodeficiency syndromes.

611695	TITLE *611695 TAU TUBULIN KINASE 2; TTBK2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Houlden et al. (2007) characterized the TTBK2 gene. TTBK2 produces a
5.6-kb transcript in which the longest open reading frame is 3,732
nucleotides, encoding a protein of 1,244 amino acids. The gene is
alternatively spliced, with ubiquitous expression in human adult and
fetal tissues. The N-terminus of TTBK2 encodes a
serine-threonine-tyrosine kinase domain, and a C-terminal region shows
homology to TTBK1. By in situ hybridization, Houlden et al. (2007)
showed that TTBK2 was expressed in all brain regions in human, rat, and
mouse tissue. There was particularly high expression in Purkinje cells
of the cerebellum, granular cell layer, hippocampus, midbrain, and
substantia nigra. Lower expression was seen in the cortex of human, rat,
and mouse brains.

GENE FUNCTION

TTBK2 encodes a member of the casein kinase (CK1) group of eukaryotic
protein kinases, as indicated by its ability to phosphorylate tau
(157140) and tubulin (see 602529) in vitro. TTBK1 has been implicated in
Alzheimer disease (104300) and in tangle formation (Sato et al., 2006).
The 2 TTBK2 phosphorylation sites in tau (ser208 and ser210) are priming
sites for the phosphorylation of tau by GSK-3-beta (605004), which
influences tau pathology.

GENE STRUCTURE

Houlden et al. (2007) determined that the TTBK2 gene comprises 16 exons.

MAPPING

Houlden et al. (2007) localized the TTBK2 to chromosome 15q15.2, within
a critical region linked to spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA11; 604432).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Spinocerebellar ataxia 11 (SCA11; 604432) is a pure progressive
cerebellar ataxia that has been linked to 15q14-q21 (Worth et al.,
1999). Houlden et al. (2007) narrowed the assignment to a 5.6-cM region
containing 134 genes. In an 8-generation English family they found a
1-base insertion in the TTBK2 gene creating a premature stop codon and a
truncation of the normal protein (611695.0001). In a second family of
Pakistani ancestry, a different mutation was found (611695.0002).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA 11
TTBK2, 1-BP INS, 1329A

In an English family from Devon with SCA11 (604432) in 8 generations,
Houlden et al. (2007) identified in affected individuals a 1-base
insertion of an adenosine in exon 13 of the TTBK2 gene, at nucleotide
1329, codon 444 (1329insA). This created a premature stop site (TGA) in
the mRNA at codon 450, truncating the normal protein from 1,244 to 450
amino acids.

.0002
SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA 11
TTBK2, 2-BP DEL, 1284GA

In a family of Pakistani ancestry with 5 individuals over 3 generations
presenting with spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA11; 604432), Houlden et al.
(2007) identified a frameshift deletion of 2 bases (GA) in exon 13 of
TTBK2 at nucleotides 1284 and 1285 in codons 428 and 429
(1284_1285delAG). The deletion created a premature stop site (TGA) in
mRNA at codon 449.

;;HISTONE GENE CLUSTER 1, H3H;;
HIST1 CLUSTER, H3H;;
H3 HISTONE FAMILY, MEMBER K; H3FK;;
H3/K
DESCRIPTION For background information on histones, histone gene clusters, and the
H3 histone family, see HIST1H3A (602810).

CLONING

By genomic sequence analysis, Marzluff et al. (2002) identified the
mouse and human HIST1H3H genes. They noted that all H3 genes in histone
gene cluster-1 (HIST1), including HIST1H3H, encode the same protein,
designated H3.1. H3.1 differs from H3.2, which is encoded by HIST2H3C
(142780), at only 1 residue, and from histone H3.3, which is encoded by
both H3F3A (601128) and H3F3B (601058), at a few residues.

MAPPING

By analysis of a YAC contig from chromosome 6p22-p21.3, Albig and
Doenecke (1997) characterized a second cluster of 16 histone genes,
including H3/k, located 2 Mb centromeric to the major histone gene
cluster.

By genomic sequence analysis, Marzluff et al. (2002) determined that the
histone gene cluster on chromosome 6p22-p21, which they called HIST1,
contains 55 histone genes, including HIST1H3H.

GENE FUNCTION

See HIST1H3A (602810) for functional information on H3.1 and the H3
histone family.

610855	TITLE *610855 ANKYRIN REPEAT DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 26; ANKRD26
;;KIAA1074
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Kikuno et al. (1999) cloned ANKRD26, which they designated
KIAA1074. The deduced protein contains 1,709 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected moderate expression in fetal liver and in nearly all adult
tissues and specific brain regions examined. Low expression was detected
in adult pancreas and spleen and in fetal brain.

By database analysis, Hahn et al. (2006) identified ANKRD26 as a distant
homolog of the POTE family (see POTE2; 608914). The ANKRD26 protein
contains 4 N-terminal ankyrin repeats and a C-terminal coiled-coil
region. It shares 61.2% amino acid identity with mouse Ankrd26.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hahn et al. (2006) determined that the ANKRD26 gene contains 34 exons.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Kikuno et al. (1999) mapped the ANKRD26
gene to chromosome 10. By genomic sequence analysis, Hahn et al. (2006)
mapped the ANKRD26 gene to chromosome 10p12.1. They mapped the mouse
Ankrd26 gene to chromosome 6F1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 9 of 20 unrelated families with autosomal dominant nonsyndromic
thrombocytopenia-2 (THC2; 188000), Pippucci et al. (2011) identified 6
different heterozygous mutations in the 5-prime promoter region of the
ANKRD26 gene (see, e.g., 610855.0001-610855.0003). All of the mutations
occurred in a highly conserved 19-nucleotide stretch. In vitro
functional expression assays in Dami human megakaryoblastic cells
indicated that the mutations resulted in increased expression,
particularly when the cells were stimulated toward maturation. The
findings suggested a gain-of-function effect. Pippucci et al. (2011)
speculated that the ANKRD26 mutations interfere with the mechanism
controlling the expression of ANKRD26, which would then affect
megakaryopoiesis and platelet production, perhaps by inducing apoptosis.
The phenotype was characterized by thrombocytopenia without any
morphologic or functional platelet defect.

ANIMAL MODEL

Bera et al. (2008) generated mice homozygous for partial inactivation of
the Ankrd26 gene and observed the development of extreme obesity,
insulin resistance, and a dramatic increase in body size. The obesity
was associated with hyperphagia with no reduction in energy expenditure
or activity. Bera et al. (2008) detected expression of Ankrd26 in the
arcuate and ventromedial nuclei within the hypothalamus and in the
ependyma and the circumventricular organs that act as an interface
between the peripheral circulation and the brain. They also found
increased phosphorylation of Akt (see AKT1; 164730) and mTOR (FRAP1;
601231) in mutant hearts compared to wildtype.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
THROMBOCYTOPENIA 2
ANKRD26, -134G-A

In 7 affected members of a large Italian family with autosomal dominant
thrombocytopenia-2 (THC2; 188000) originally reported by Savoia et al.
(1999), Pippucci et al. (2011) identified a heterozygous -134G-A
transition in the 5-prime promoter region of the ANKRD26 gene. The same
mutation was also identified in 2 members of a second Italian family
with the disorder. The mutation was not found in 500 controls. In vitro
functional expression studies of the mutant protein in K562
undifferentiated myeloid cells showed 2.7 to 4.5-fold increased
expression of a luciferase reporter. Transfection of the -134G-A
mutation in Dami human megakaryoblastic cells showed overexpression of
the reporter gene in cells that were both unstimulated and stimulated
toward megakaryocytic maturation. Punzo et al. (2010) determined that
this large Italian family, originally reported by Savoia et al. (1999),
had a pathogenic mutation in the ACBD5 gene that caused the disorder,
but the findings of Pippucci et al. (2011) suggested that the ANKRD26
mutation was responsible for the phenotype.

.0002
THROMBOCYTOPENIA 2
ANKRD26, -127A-T

In 6 affected members of a large Italian family with autosomal dominant
thrombocytopenia-2 (THC2; 188000), Pippucci et al. (2011) identified a
heterozygous -127A-T transversion in the 5-prime promoter region of the
ANKRD26 gene. The same mutation was also identified in 2 members of
family from Argentina with the disorder. The mutation was not found in
500 controls. Transfection of the -127A-T mutation in Dami human
megakaryoblastic cells showed overexpression of the reporter gene in
Dami cells that were stimulated toward megakaryocytic maturation, but
not in unstimulated cells.

.0003
THROMBOCYTOPENIA 2
ANKRD26, -128G-A

In 7 affected members of a large Italian family with autosomal dominant
thrombocytopenia-2 (THC2; 188000), Pippucci et al. (2011) identified a
heterozygous -128G-A transition in the 5-prime promoter region of the
ANKRD26 gene. The same mutation was also identified in 3 members of
another Italian family with the disorder. The mutation was not found in
500 controls. Transfection of the -128G-A mutation in Dami human
megakaryoblastic cells showed overexpression of the reporter gene in
cells that were both unstimulated and stimulated toward megakaryocytic
maturation.

179710	TITLE *179710 REGULATOR OF CHROMOSOME CONDENSATION 1; RCC1
;;CHROMOSOME CONDENSATION 1; CHC1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Mitotic cells possess chromosome-condensing factor(s), the presence of
which is shown by fusing mitotic and interphase cells. Upon fusion, the
chromatin is condensed and exhibits various forms of prematurely
condensed chromosomes (PCCs), depending on the phase of the cell. The
condensation process is essential for the even distribution of genetic
material into daughter cells. On the other hand, transcription cannot
occur from the mitotically condensed chromosomes. Cells obviously must
have regulatory mechanisms that allow condensation of the chromatin to
occur at a precisely correct time in the cell cycle. In the normal cell
cycle, the chromosome-condensing factor(s) appears in the early G2 phase
and accumulates toward the mitotic phase. Mutations associated with this
step in the cell cycle have to be isolated as temperature-sensitive
mutants (Kai et al., 1986). Ohtsubo et al. (1987) cloned the human RCC1
gene after DNA-mediated gene transfer into a temperature-sensitive
mutant which shows premature chromosome condensation at nonpermissive
temperatures (39.5-40 degrees C). This gene codes for a 2.5-kb
polyadenylated RNA that is well conserved in hamsters and humans.
Ohtsubo et al. (1987) found 2 cDNA clones in a human library that
complemented the temperature-sensitive mutation with an efficiency
comparable to that of the genomic DNA clone. The clones appeared to
encode a protein of 421 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight
of 44,847.

GENE STRUCTURE

Furuno et al. (1991) isolated total genomic DNA for the human RCC1 gene
from HeLa cells and determined its complete nucleotide sequence (34,641
bp) by the shotgun sequencing method. The gene was found to have 14
exons, 8 of which (starting from the seventh one) coded the 7 repeated
sequences of RCC1 protein. A single exon corresponded roughly to each
repeat of the RCC1 protein except for the middle one, indicating that
the RCC1 gene was generated through amplification of a primordial exon.
Primer extension analysis demonstrated the presence of an internal
promoter.

MAPPING

By hybridization to DNA from sorted chromosomes, Ohtsubo et al. (1987)
concluded that the gene, which they symbolized RCC1, is located on
chromosome 1. By fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using a
suppression FISH method for elimination of repetitive sequences in the
genomic clone, Nishimoto et al. (1994) mapped the CHC1 gene to 1p36.1.
They reported work of others indicating that the mouse counterpart maps
to the distal region of chromosome 4.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Makde et al. (2010) determined the crystal structure of a complex of
Drosophila RCC1 and the nucleosome core particle at 2.9-angstrom
resolution, providing an atomic view of how a chromatin protein
interacts with the histone and DNA components of the nucleosome. Their
structure also suggested that the Widom 601 DNA positioning sequence
present in the nucleosomes forms a 145-bp nucleosome core particle, not
the expected canonical 147-bp particle.

GENE FUNCTION

Bischoff et al. (1990) demonstrated that RCC1 protein is homologous to a
47-kD nuclear protein recognized by antikinetochore autoimmune sera from
patients with CREST syndrome (181750).

Hayashi et al. (1995) showed that, both in mammalian cells and in yeast,
RANBP1 (601180) acts as a negative regulator of RCC1 by inhibiting
RCC1-stimulated guanine nucleotide release from RAN (601179). See also
601181.

Ohba et al. (1999) demonstrated that the nucleotide exchange activity of
RCC1, the only known nucleotide exchange factor for RAN, was required
for microtubule aster formation with or without demembranated sperm in
Xenopus egg extracts arrested in meiosis II. In the RCC1-depleted egg
extracts, RanGTP (see 602362), but not RanGDP, induced self-organization
of microtubule asters, and the process required the activity of dynein
(see 603297). Thus, RAN was shown to regulate formation of the
microtubule network.

Adding chromatin beads to Xenopus egg extracts causes nucleation of
microtubules, which eventually reorganize into a bipolar spindle. Using
this assay, Carazo-Salas et al. (1999) demonstrated that the activity of
chromosome-associated RCC1 protein is required for spindle formation.
When in the GTP-bound state (RanGTP), RAN itself induces microtubule
nucleation and spindle-like structures in M-phase extract. Carazo-Salas
et al. (1999) proposed that RCC1 generates a high local concentration of
RanGTP around chromatin which, in turn, induces the local nucleation of
microtubules.

The Ran GTPase (601179) controls nucleocytoplasmic transport, mitotic
spindle formation, and nuclear envelope assembly. These functions rely
on the association of the Ran-specific exchange factor, RCC1, with
chromatin. Nemergut et al. (2001) found that RCC1 binds directly to
mononucleosomes and to histones H2A and H2B (142711). RCC1 utilizes
these histones to bind Xenopus sperm chromatin, and the binding of RCC1
to nucleosomes or histones stimulates the catalytic activity of RCC1.
Nemergut et al. (2001) proposed that the docking of RCC1 to H2A/H2B
establishes the polarity of the Ran-GTP gradient that drives nuclear
envelope assembly, nuclear transport, and other nuclear events.

Li and Zheng (2004) provided evidence that CDC2 (116940) coordinates
spindle assembly with the cell cycle during mitosis through
phosphorylation of RCC1. CDC2 phosphorylates RCC1 on serines located in
or near its nuclear localization signal. This phosphorylation activates
RCC1 to generate RanGTP on mitotic chromosomes, which is required for
spindle assembly and chromosome segregation.

At the time of the report of Schaner Tooley et al. (2010), the RAN
guanine nucleotide exchange factor RCC1 was the only protein for which
any biologic function of alpha-N-methylation had been identified.
Methylation-defective mutants of RCC1 have reduced affinity for DNA (Hao
and Macara, 2008) and cause mitotic defects (Chen et al., 2007), but
further characterization of this modification had been hindered by
ignorance of the responsible methyltransferase. Schaner Tooley et al.
(2010) reported the discovery of the first alpha-N-methyltransferase,
which they named N-terminal RCC1 methyltransferase (NRMT; 613560).
Substrate docking and mutational analysis of RCC1 defined the NRMT
recognition sequence and enabled the identification of numerous
methylation targets, including SET (600960) and RB1 (614041). Knockdown
of NRMT recapitulated the multispindle phenotype seen with
methylation-defective RCC1 mutants, demonstrating the importance of
alpha-N-methylation for normal bipolar spindle formation and chromosome
segregation.

NOMENCLATURE

RCC1 was used by HGM workshops for the primary renal cell carcinoma
locus on 3p (144700). CHC1 is another symbol for this locus (McAlpine,
1988).

;;NCKAP5-LIKE;;
KIAA1602
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human fetal brain
cDNA library, Nagase et al. (2000) identified a partial NCKAP5L clone,
which they designated KIAA1602. RT-PCR ELISA detected robust NCKAP5L
expression in all adult and fetal tissues examined, with highest
expression in adult brain and ovary and in most adult brain regions
examined. Expression was lower in fetal brain than in adult brain.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the NCKAP5L
gene to chromosome 12.

Hartz (2013) mapped the NCKAP5L gene to chromosome 12q13.12 based on an
alignment of the NCKAP5L sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB046822) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

603886	TITLE *603886 ARTEMIN; ARTN
;;NEUBLASTIN;;
ENOVIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Neurotrophic factors, such as GDNF (600837), NTN (602018), and PSPN
(602921), orchestrate multiple aspects of the development and
maintenance of the central and peripheral nervous systems. These GDNF
family ligands signal though a multicomponent receptor system composed
of a high affinity binding component, (GFRA1-GFRA4; see 601496) and a
common signaling component, the RET (164761) receptor tyrosine kinase.
By searching databases for sequences related to NTN, Baloh et al. (1998)
identified human and mouse genomic clones and cDNAs encoding a novel
member of the GDNF family, which they named Artemin. Northern blot
analysis revealed that Artemin is expressed at low levels in many
peripheral adult tissues. Using in situ hybridization analysis of rat
embryos at E14, the authors found that Artemin is expressed in regions
that are likely to influence the development of peripheral neurons, such
as the nerve roots, but not the developing neurons, of the dorsal root
ganglia. The predicted human Artemin protein contains a signal peptide
and a large proregion. The mature protein contains 113 amino acids.

GENE FUNCTION

Baloh et al. (1998) demonstrated that Artemin, like GDNF and NTN,
supports the survival of neurons from all peripheral ganglia examined,
including sympathetic, neural crest, and placodally derived sensory
neurons. In addition, Artemin can support the survival of at least 1
population of central nervous system neurons, the dopaminergic midbrain
neurons. Artemin is a ligand for the GFR-alpha-3 (GRFA3; 605710)
coreceptor, which together with RET, represents the preferred
multicomponent receptor for Artemin signaling.

In a mouse model of neuropathic pain, Gardell et al. (2003) found that
systemic, intermittent administration of artemin produced dose- and
time-related reversal of nerve injury-induced pain behavior as well as
partial to complete normalization of multiple morphologic and
neurochemical features of the injury state. After spinal injury, there
was an increase in dorsal root ganglion cells that were GFR-alpha-3
reactive, the primary site of artemin action.

GENE STRUCTURE

Baloh et al. (1998) determined that the Artemin gene contains 3 introns.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Baloh et al. (1998) mapped the Artemin
gene to chromosome 1p33-p32.

ANIMAL MODEL

Honma et al. (2002) found that Artn- and Gfra3-deficient mice shared
abnormalities in the migration and axonal projection pattern of the
entire sympathetic nervous system, resulting in abnormal innervation of
target tissues and cell death due to lack of neurotrophic support. They
visualized Artn expression in transgenic mice expressing
fluorescence-tagged Artn in order to characterize these defects.
Fluorescence was detected along blood vessels and in cells nearby to
sympathetic axonal projections. Honma et al. (2002) confirmed the
chemoattractive properties of Artn by demonstrating that sympathetic
neuroblasts migrated and projected axons toward Artn-soaked beads
implanted into mouse embryos.

;;BACTERICIDAL PERMEABILITY-INCREASING PROTEIN-LIKE 2; BPIL2;;
BPI-LIKE 2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

BPIL2 shares significant similarity with members of the lipid transfer
(LT)/lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein (LBP; 151990) family. All
LT/LBP proteins are capable of binding phospholipids and LPS. Some are
involved in lipid transfer and metabolism (e.g., CETP; 118470), and
others are involved in host response to gram-negative bacterial
infection (e.g., BPI; 109195) (summary by Mulero et al., 2002).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to BPI, followed by
screening and RACE of a fetal skin cDNA library, Mulero et al. (2002)
cloned BPIL2. The deduced 507-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal
signal sequence and shares 28% identity with BPI. Structural modeling
predicted that, like BPI, BPIL2 assumes a boomerang-like conformation
composed of 2 domains, each of which includes a hydrophobic pocket on
its concave surface. BPIL2 also has 10 potential N-glycosylation sites
and 2 conserved cysteines predicted to form a disulfide bridge to anchor
the N-terminal domain. Mulero et al. (2002) also identified several
splice variants of BPIL2. In situ hybridization detected BPIL2 in the
basal layer of the epidermis from inflammatory skin of patients with
psoriasis (see 177900), but not in normal fetal or adult skin.

GENE STRUCTURE

Mulero et al. (2002) determined that the BPIL2 gene contains 15 exons.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid, radiation hybrid, and database analyses, Mulero
et al. (2002) mapped the BPIL2 gene (BPIFC) to chromosome 22q13.

603456	TITLE *603456 DPH2, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; DPH2
;;DPH2-LIKE 2; DPH2L2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Diphthamide is a unique posttranslationally modified histidine found
only in translation elongation factor-2 (EEF2; 130610). This
modification is conserved from archaebacteria to humans and serves as
the target for ADP-ribosylation and inactivation of EEF2 by diphtheria
toxin (DT) and Pseudomonas exotoxin A. DPH2 is 1 of several enzymes
involved in synthesis of diphthamide in EEF2 (Liu et al., 2004).

CLONING

Mattheakis et al. (1993) found that dph2, a S. cerevisiae diphtheria
resistance gene, encodes a protein involved in diphthamide biosynthesis.
By searching an EST database, Schultz et al. (1998) identified a human
cDNA with 63% identity to the corresponding nucleotide sequence of human
DPH2-like 1 (DPH2L1, or DPH1; 603527). Using a PCR strategy, they
recovered cDNAs corresponding to the entire coding region of the gene,
which they called DPH2L2. The predicted 489-amino acid protein shared
24% and 28% sequence identity with DPH2L1 and yeast dph2, respectively.
Northern blot analysis revealed that DPH2L2 was expressed ubiquitously
as a 2.5-kb mRNA. An additional 3-kb transcript was found in several
tissues.

Liu et al. (2004) cloned mouse Dph2. The deduced 489-amino acid protein
shares 83% identity with human DPH2.

GENE FUNCTION

Liu et al. (2004) showed that mouse Dph2 could complement the
DT-resistant phenotype of diphthamide-deficient mutant Chinese hamster
ovary cell lines. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that yeast and
mouse Dph1 (603527) and Dph2 interacted, suggesting that these enzymes
may function in diphthamide biosynthesis as a dimer or multimer.

Carette et al. (2009) used insertional mutagenesis to develop a
screening method to generate null alleles in a human cell line haploid
for all chromosomes except chromosome 8. Using this approach, they
identified genes encoding important elements of the biosynthetic pathway
of diphthamide, which are required for the cytotoxic effects of
diphtheria toxin and exotoxin A. Mutants of the DPH1, DPH2, and DPH5
(611075) genes, involved in diphthamide biosynthesis, were identified as
resistant to both anthrax toxin and diphtheria toxin.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Schultz et al. (1998) mapped the
DPH2L2 gene to 1p34.

;;KERATIN, HAIR, BASIC, 6; KRTHB6;;
KERATIN, HARD, TYPE II, 6; HB6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

In addition to the epithelial, or soft, alpha-keratins, the keratin
multigene family comprises the smaller family of hard alpha-keratins
that, in accordance with their most frequently investigated site of
expression, are referred to as hair keratins. Independent of species,
the hair keratin family consists of several members of each of 2
subfamilies; according to Winter et al. (1997), 7 type I human hair
keratins (e.g., KRTHA1; 601077) and 4 type II hair keratins had been
identified.

Rogers et al. (1997) reviewed human hair keratin nomenclature.
Expression studies showed that hair keratin synthesis is not restricted
to the hair follicle and the cortex but clearly begins earlier in matrix
cells of the hair bulb. Whereas both matrix and cuticle trichocytes
appear to express only 1 keratin pair each, keratin expression in the
cortex involves at least 4 sequentially synthesized, structurally highly
related keratin pairs. The keratins have highly homologous central
alpha-helical rod domains flanked by variable-sized head and tail
domains. The boundary peptides at the extremities of the rod domain (the
helix initiation motif (HIM) of the 1A subdomain and the helix
termination motif (HTM) of the 2B subdomain) are highly conserved and
crucial for structure and function. Pathogenic mutations, which have
been described in epithelial alpha-keratins in a number of hereditary
disorders of skin, skin appendages, and oral mucosa, appear most
disruptive when located in the HIMs or HTMs of keratins. See KRTHA1 for
additional general information on hair keratins.

CLONING

By screening a human scalp cDNA library with a mouse genomic sequence
corresponding to the C terminus and 3-prime noncoding region of Hb6,
Rogers et al. (1997) isolated a cDNA encoding KRT86 (KRTHB6, or HB6).
The predicted protein has 483 amino acids. The amino acid sequences of
HB1 (602153), HB3 (602765), HB5 (602767), and HB6 are highly conserved,
with the similarity extending beyond the alpha-helical region into the
N-terminal and proximal C-terminal domains. HB6 is more closely related
to HB1 and HB3 than to HB5. In situ hybridization studies demonstrated
that type II keratin genes are sequentially activated in the hair
follicle in the following order: HB5--(HB1, HB3)--HB6. The synthesis of
HB6 mRNA begins slightly higher in the hair shaft than HB1 and HB3 mRNA
syntheses and continues much farther up, ending in the keratogenous
zone.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bowden et al. (1998) cloned the complete genomic sequence of HB6. The
HB6 gene has 9 exons and spans about 7.1 kb from the translational
initiation ATG codon to the poly(A) site. Its upstream regulatory
sequences contain a LEF1 (153245)-binding site, which is found in other
hair keratin genes.

MAPPING

Rogers et al. (1995) demonstrated that human hair keratin genes
colocalize with epithelial keratin genes on 17q12-q21 (type I genes) and
12q13 (type II genes), respectively.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Bowden et al. (1998) mapped the
HB6 gene to the type II hair keratin cluster on 12q13. The HB6 gene is
about 10 kb from the HB1 gene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Monilethrix (158000) is an autosomal dominant hair disorder
characterized clinically by alopecia and follicular papules. Affected
hairs have uniform elliptical nodes of normal thickness and intermittent
constrictions, internodes at which the hair easily breaks. Usually only
the scalp is involved, but in severe forms, the secondary sexual hair,
eyebrows, eyelashes, and nails may also be affected. The disorder has
been linked to the type II keratin gene cluster on 12q13 in several
pedigrees. Winter et al. (1997) analyzed a matrix basic keratin and 3
cortical basic keratins in a 4-generation British monilethrix family
with known linkage to 12q13. The gene regions encoding HIM and HTM were
amplified and sequenced. The authors detected a heterozygous G-to-A
point mutation in the first position of the glutamic acid 413 codon GAG
in the exon encoding the HTM of the cortical keratin HB6 in affected
members of the family. The mutation led to a nonconservative
glu413-to-lys (E413K; 601928.0001) substitution. A 3-generation French
monilethrix family in which linkage analysis had not been performed also
revealed a heterozygous point mutation in codon 413 in affected
individuals, but in this case, a G-to-T transversion occurred at the
third base of the codon and yielded a conservative substitution of
aspartic acid for glutamic acid-413 (E413D; 601928.0002). Winter et al.
(1997) predicted that, by analogy with epithelial keratins, a
monilethrix phenotype should also be expected from mutations in the type
I partner of HB6.

Winter et al. (1999) stated that causative mutations for monilethrix had
been found only in 2 type II cortex keratins, HB6 and HB1. In these hair
keratins, the HTM was the only site in which the mutations were located.
They described the first mutation in the HIM in the H6 gene, a change
from asn114 to asp (601928.0003). Winter et al. (1999) suggested that
monilethrix is a disease of hair cortex and that causative mutations are
restricted to type II hair keratins.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MONILETHRIX
KRT86, GLU413LYS

Winter et al. (1997) identified a glu413-to-lys (E413K) mutation in
affected members in the hair cortical basic keratin 6 in a British
monilethrix (158000) family that had been previously been found to show
linkage to a type II keratin cluster on 12q13. The mutation in the
analogous glutamic acid residue of the type II epidermal keratin 2e has
been identified in cases of ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens (600194.0002).

This mutation was originally designated GLU410LYS because the mutation
was identified in a partial HB6 cDNA clone; based on the complete HB6
sequence reported by Bowden et al. (1998), Winter et al. (1998) revised
the designation of the mutation to glu413 to lys. Glu413 to lys, the
most frequently observed mutation in monilethrix, was also found by
Korge et al. (1997) in 3 unrelated families.

Korge et al. (1998) sequenced the critical helix termination motif in
the 2B domain of the KRTHB6 gene in 13 unrelated families or cases with
monilethrix. In 5 of the 13 cases, they found the glu413-to-lys
mutation. In 8 cases, however, including 3 in which linkage data were
consistent with a defect in the type II keratin locus, no mutation was
found in this domain. These findings demonstrate that codon 413 and the
glutamic acid, which is residue 117 of the 2B helix, is a mutation
hotspot for monilethrix.

Winter et al. (1999) stated that this mutation had been found in 22
cases of monilethrix.

In 15 affected members of 2 unrelated Indian families with monilethrix,
Khandpur et al. (2004) identified the E413K mutation in the helix
termination motif (HTM) in exon 7 of the KRTHB6 gene; in each family,
the mutation segregated with polymorphisms in the HTM motif of the
KRTHB1 gene (602153): 1 with 3 novel SNPs in cis and a second with only
an intronic SNP. The 9 affected members of family 1 had a localized
severe hair defect with beaded appearance confined to the scalp and
carried the KRTHB1 polymorphisms in heterozygous state. The 6 affected
members of family 2 had a generalized unbeaded hair defect of moderate
severity and carried the KRTHB1 polymorphism with 3 SNPs in homozygous
state. Presence of both the E413K mutation and variation in the KRTHB1
gene was not observed in 150 randomly selected unaffected controls.

.0002
MONILETHRIX
KRT86, GLU413ASP

In a French family with monilethrix (158000), Winter et al. (1997)
demonstrated a glu413-to-asp amino acid substitution (G413D) in the
product of the HB6 gene. Although the same codon was involved as in the
initially studied British patient (600194.0001), the disorder was
clearly milder in the French family in which an adolescent's symptoms
were restricted largely to keratosis pilaris of the limbs.

This mutation was originally designated GLU410ASP based on a partial HB6
cDNA clone; based on the complete HB6 sequence reported by Bowden et al.
(1998), Winter et al. (1998) revised the designation of the mutation to
glu413 to asp.

.0003
MONILETHRIX
KRT86, GLU402LYS

In a patient with monilethrix (158000), Winter et al. (1999) identified
a glu402-to-lys mutation (E402K) in the HTM of cortex keratin HB6 which
was the equivalent of the E402K mutation of HB1 (602153.0002). The
mutation was detected in only 1 clinically affected individual of an
American family. Thus, the G-to-A transition represented a spontaneous
germline mutation in the HB6 gene. This finding indicated that both the
HB6/HB1 E413K substitution and the HB6/HB1 E402K substitution represent
mutation hotspots in the HTM of the type II cortex keratins.

See also 601928.0005 and Pearce et al. (1999).

In an 18-year-old woman of Turkish descent with monilethrix (158000),
van Steensel et al. (2005) identified the E402K mutation.

In 11 affected members of a 3-generation consanguineous Turkish family
segregating monilethrix, Celep et al. (2009) identified heterozygosity
for the E402K mutation in the KRT86 gene. Noting the low (1.7) lod score
obtained in this family at marker D12S390, the authors emphasized the
difficulties of mapping a heterozygous disorder in a country with a high
rate of consanguinity.

.0004
MONILETHRIX
KRT86, ASN114ASP

Winter et al. (1999) described the first monilethrix (158000)-causing
mutation in the HIM of the cortex keratin HB6. The critical
asn114-to-asp substitution was found only in affected members of a large
Swedish 3-generation kindred. Considering that since childhood, half of
the affected individuals suffered from complete baldness and follicular
keratosis, the HIM mutation seemed to be associated with a rather severe
disease phenotype.

.0005
MONILETHRIX
KRT86, GLU402GLN

Pearce et al. (1999) studied 2 unrelated monilethrix (158000) patients
and identified heterozygosity for 2 different mutations in the same
codon in exon 7 of the KRTHB6 gene. Both mutations affected the first
base of codon 402 (glutamic acid). In one patient, a G-to-C transversion
occurred causing a glutamine substitution (GAG to CAG; E402Q), whereas
in the second patient, a G-to-A transition yielded a lysine residue (GAG
to AAG; E402K 601928.0003). Both mutations disrupted a TaqI restriction
site and RFLP analysis showed that a diagnostic 361-bp fragment could
confirm the presence of the mutation.

.0006
MONILETHRIX
KRT86, ALA118GLU

In affected members of a 3-generation French family with monilethrix
(158000), Winter et al. (2000) identified a heterozygous C-to-A
transversion in exon 1 of the KRT86 gene, resulting in an ala118-to-glu
(A118E) substitution in the helix initiation motif. Winter et al. (2000)
concluded that the mutation was incompatible with stable intermediate
filament formation.

191050	TITLE *191050 TRYPTOPHANYL-tRNA SYNTHETASE; WARS
;;TRYPTOPHANYL-tRNA SYNTHETASE, CYTOPLASMIC
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases catalyze the first step of protein synthesis.
Human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (YARS; 603623) can be split into 2
fragments having distinct cytokine activities, thereby linking protein
synthesis to cytokine signaling pathways. Tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase
(WARS) is a close homolog of tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase. It catalyzes the
aminoacylation of tRNA(trp) with tryptophan, an essential function of
the cell's protein synthesis machinery.

CLONING

Frolova et al. (1991) cloned the human gene and reported its nucleotide
sequence. Shimizu et al. (1976) and Denney et al. (1978) located the
structural gene for tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase on chromosome 14.

GENE FUNCTION

In normal cells, human tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase exists in 2 forms.
The major form is the full-length protein, and the other is a truncated
form in which most of the extra-NH2-terminal domain is deleted because
of alternative splicing of the pre-mRNA (Tolstrup et al., 1995; Turpaev
et al., 1996), with met48 being deduced as the NH2-terminal residue of
the truncated form. The expression of the short form of WARS is highly
stimulated in human cells by the addition of interferon-gamma (IFNG;
147570).

Wakasugi et al. (2002) showed that the truncated form of WARS is
angiostatic in several different systems and assays, whereas the
full-length enzyme is inactive. Thus, protein synthesis may be linked to
the regulation of angiogenesis by a natural fragment of
tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase.

Otani et al. (2002) showed that a recombinant form of a COOH-terminal
fragment of tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase is a potent antagonist of
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; 192240)-induced angiogenesis
in a mouse model and of naturally occurring retinal angiogenesis in the
neonatal mouse. Angiostatic activity was dose-dependent in both systems.
The full-length protein was inactive as an antagonist of angiogenesis.
The results suggested that fragments of tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase, as
naturally occurring and potentially nonimmunogenic anti-angiogenics, can
be used for the treatment of neovascular eye diseases.

MAPPING

Francke et al. (1977) assigned WARS to 14q21-qter. Graphodatsky et al.
(1993) confirmed the assignment to chromosome 14 and regionalized it by
isotopic in situ hybridization to 14q23-q31. The gene may be in the
14q24 band where one-third of the grains were localized.

Borglum et al. (1996) mapped a cDNA probe of the WARS gene by a
combination of somatic cell hybrid analysis, fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH), and linkage analysis. Both FISH and linkage
analysis independently supported a more distal position of WARS than had
been previously reported. FISH mapping indicated the most likely
position to be 14q32.31.

Jensen et al. (2001) found that a pseudogene of the NDUFB3 gene
(603839), designated NDUFB3P4, is positioned in intron 2 of the WARS
gene in the opposite direction.
