602409	TITLE *602409 MYELOID/LYMPHOID OR MIXED LINEAGE LEUKEMIA, TRANSLOCATED TO, 10; MLLT10
;;ALL1-FUSED GENE FROM CHROMOSOME 10; AF10
AF10/MLL FUSION GENE, INCLUDED;;
AF10/HEAB FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Translocations affecting chromosome 11q23 involve many partner
chromosome regions and occur in various leukemias (see 600328). The
11q23 gene involved in the translocations is MLL (159555). Using RACE to
identify MLL fusion transcripts in RNA from 2 leukemia patients, Chaplin
et al. (1995) identified the partner gene involved in t(10;11)(p12;q23)
translocations. In both patients, the translocation fused MLL to a gene
that the authors designated AF10. The AF10 gene encodes a predicted
1,027-amino acid protein containing an N-terminal zinc finger and a
C-terminal leucine zipper domain that are highly homologous to similar
domains in AF17 (600328) and BR140 (602410). Northern blot analysis
showed that AF10 is expressed as a 5.5-kb mRNA in many tissues with
highest expression in testis, and has an alternatively spliced exon.

GENE FUNCTION

The AF10 gene is one of the few MLL partner genes to be independently
rearranged with a third gene in leukemia, the CALM gene (603025) in the
t(10;11)(p12;q14) translocation (Dreyling et al., 1996). Chimeric fusion
proteins MLL/AF10 and CALM/AF10 consistently retain the leucine zipper
motif of AF10. Debernardi et al. (2002) used this part of the C-terminal
region as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screening of a testis cDNA library.
They found that the leucine zipper interacted with GAS41 (602116), a
protein previously identified as the product of an amplified gene in a
glioblastoma. GAS41 shows significant homology to the human MLL fusion
partners AF9 (159558) and ENL (159556). The study also showed that GAS41
interacts with integrase interactor-1 (INI1; 601607) and that INI1 is a
component of the SWI/SNF complex (see 604958), which acts to remodel
chromatin and to modulate transcription. Retention of the leucine zipper
in the MLL and CALM fusions suggested that a key feature of these
chimeric proteins may be their ability to interfere in normal gene
regulation through interaction with the adenosine triphosphate-dependent
chromatin remodeling complexes.

MAPPING

Chaplin et al. (1995) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to map the
AF10 gene to 10p12.

CYTOGENETICS

- AF10/MLL Fusion Gene

Chaplin et al. (1995) found that all known translocations involving MLL
and AF10 or AF17 have involved breakpoints between the zinc finger and
leucine zipper domains, and have yielded fusion proteins in which the
MLL zinc fingers were replaced with leucine zipper regions. Chaplin et
al. (1995) speculated that the fusion proteins may participate in
abnormal heterodimers.

- AF10/HEAB Fusion Gene

Tanabe et al. (1996) identified an invins(10;11)(p12;q23q12) and other
complex chromosomal rearrangements in a 2-year old boy with acute
monoblastic leukemia (AML-M5). Cloning of the proximal 10p breakpoint
showed that the MLL gene at chromosome 11q23 was fused to the 3-prime
portion of AF10 at chromosome 10p12. Cloning of the telomeric 10p
junction revealed that the 5-prime portion of AF10 was fused with the
HEAB gene (608757). The 5-prime AF10/HEAB fusion transcript was out of
frame, while the MLL/3-prime AF10 transcript was in frame.

;;CYCLIN-FOLD PROTEIN 1; CFP1;;
CYCLIN X; CCNX;;
CHROMOSOME 10 OPEN READING FRAME 9; C10ORF9
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cyclins, such as CCNY, control cell division cycles and regulate
cyclin-dependent kinases (e.g., CDC2; 116940) (Li et al., 2009).

CLONING

Using mass spectrometry to identify proteins upregulated in metastatic
versus nonmetastatic human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines,
followed by database analysis, Zhang et al. (2005) identified an isoform
of CCNY that they called CFP1 variant A. The deduced protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 36.9 kD.

By database analysis and PCR of a testis cDNA library, Li et al. (2009)
cloned CCNY, which they designated CCNX. The deduced 287-amino acid
protein has a central cyclin box and shares highest similarity with
cyclin B3 (CCNB3; 300456). RT-PCR detected highest expression in testis
and lower expression in all other tissues examined except brain and
kidney. Fluorescence-tagged CCNX was expressed predominantly in the
nucleus in a human nonsmall lung cancer cell line.

GENE STRUCTURE

Li et al. (2009) determined that the CCNY gene contains 12 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Deloukas et al. (2004) mapped the CCNY
gene to chromosome 10p11.2, where it lies between the CREM (123812) and
FZD8 (606146) genes.

GENE FUNCTION

Using the promoter regions of several cell cycle regulators and
transcription factors, Li et al. (2009) showed that CCNX specifically
activated transcription from the MYC (190080) promoter.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

gene and inflammatory bowel disease, see IBD1 (266600).

B7 HOMOLOG 2; B7H2;;
GL50;;
B7-RELATED PROTEIN 1; B7RP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The costimulatory B7 molecules (e.g., B7-1, or CD80; 112203) signal
through CD28 (186760) family molecules, such as CD28, CTLA4 (123890),
and ICOS (604558). By searching sequence databases for human homologs of
the mouse B7-like gene Gl50, Ling et al. (2000) identified a brain cDNA,
KIAA0653 (Ishikawa et al., 1998), containing similar as well as
unrelated sequences. Using 3-prime RACE analysis of peripheral blood
leukocytes (PBLs) and RT-PCR of leukocyte RNA, Ling et al. (2000)
isolated a cDNA encoding a 309-amino acid human B7 homolog, which they
termed GL50, that is 42% identical to the mouse sequence. Northern blot
analysis detected highest expression of 2.4-, 3.0-, and 7.0-kb
transcripts in brain, heart, kidney, and liver, with lower expression in
colon and thymus. A 1.1-kb transcript was also detected in PBLs.

Yoshinaga et al. (2000) also cloned GL50, which they termed B7RP1.
Sequence analysis predicted that the 302-amino acid protein contains a
transmembrane domain and 5 conserved cysteine residues.

Wang et al. (2000) also cloned this gene, which they termed B7H2.
Sequence analysis predicted that the 302-amino acid type I glycoprotein
is 21% identical to B7H1 (605402).

GENE FUNCTION

By flow cytometric analysis, Ling et al. (2000) demonstrated that mouse
Gl50 binds to Icos but not to Ctla4 or Cd28.

BIAcore analysis by Yoshinaga et al. (2000) indicated that B7RP1 binds
preferentially to ICOS and does not bind to CTLA4. Flow cytometric
analysis demonstrated that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (191160) enhances
B7RP1 expression on B cells and monocytes, but decreases its expression
on dendritic cells. B7RP1 fusion protein or cells expressing B7RP1
enhanced T-cell proliferation and interleukin-2 (IL2; 147680)-dependent
cytokine production (gamma-interferon (147570) and IL10 (124092) but not
IL2) in response to anti-CD3 (see 186740) stimulation. This enhancement
could be blocked by soluble ICOS.

Flow cytometric analysis by Wang et al. (2000) demonstrated enhanced
B7H2 surface expression on dendritic cells stimulated with
granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF; 138960) and IL4
(147780), but not on those stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. Wang et
al. (2000) found that B7H2 costimulation enhances production of IL10 and
IL2 but that this varies with anti-CD3 concentration.

In mice, Xu et al. (2013) showed that Icos directly controls follicular
recruitment of activated T-helper cells in mice. This effect is
independent from ICOS ligand (ICOSL)-mediated costimulation provided by
antigen-presenting dendritic cells or cognate B cells, and does not rely
on Bcl6 (109565)-mediated programming as an intermediate step. Instead
it requires ICOSL expression by follicular bystander B cells, which do
not present cognate antigen to T-helper cells but collectively form an
ICOS-engaging field. Dynamic imaging revealed that Icos engagement
drives coordinated pseudopod formation and promotes persistent T-cell
migration at the border between the T-cell zone and the B-cell follicle
in vivo. When follicular bystander B cells could not express Icosl,
otherwise competent T-helper cells failed to develop into follicular
T-helper cells normally, and failed to promote optimal germinal center
responses. Xu et al. (2013) concluded that these results demonstrated a
costimulation-independent function of ICOS and uncovered a key role for
bystander B cells in promoting the development of follicular T-helper
cells.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1998) mapped the ICOSLG
gene, which they called KIAA0653, to chromosome 21.

ANIMAL MODEL

Mak et al. (2003) generated Icosl -/- mice by deleting the region of
Icosl encoding the IgV loop. These otherwise healthy and fertile mice
had reduced IgG1 production and affinity maturation, indicating a defect
in T cell-dependent responses. The Icosl -/- mice also had impaired T-
and B-cell interaction and germinal center formation. Adoptive transfer
experiments demonstrated that costimulation through Icos-Icosl is
pivotal in the primary, but not the secondary, phase of helper T-cell
responses. Using a model of allergic airway disease, Mak et al. (2003)
also observed lower IgE production and decreased recruitment of
inflammatory cells to the lung.

Gajewska et al. (2005) found that B7rp1-deficient mice developed airway
eosinophilia and Th2 responses, as assessed by the pattern of cytokine
and Ig production, following aerosolized ovalbumin challenge. In
addition, B7rp1-deficient mice did not develop inhalation tolerance.
Gajewska et al. (2005) concluded that the ICOS-B7RP1 pathway is
redundant for generation of Th2 responses, but it is required for
induction of inhalation tolerance.

;;TAX-TRANSCRIPTIONALLY ACTIVATED GLYCOPROTEIN 1 RECEPTOR; TXGP1L;;
OX40 ANTIGEN;;
LYMPHOID ACTIVATION ANTIGEN ACT35; ACT35;;
CD134
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ACT35 antigen is a cell surface glycoprotein that was discovered
through the production of a monoclonal antibody raised against the
HUT-102 cell line. Its expression can be induced on lymphocytes by
mitogen stimulation or viral stimulation. Because the cell and tissue
distribution resembles the pattern of the IL2 receptor, CD25 (147730),
it was speculated that a relationship between the ACT35 antigen and the
CD25 antigen exists.

CLONING

Latza et al. (1994) cloned a cDNA for the ACT35 antigen and showed its
strong homology with the previously described rat OX40 antigen. It is
therefore another member of the tumor necrosis factor/nerve growth
factor receptor family. Birkeland et al. (1995) cloned cDNA and genomic
DNA for the mouse homolog.

GENE FUNCTION

Song et al. (2004) showed that OX40 engagement sustains activation of
protein kinase B (PKB; 164730) and intermediates of PKB signaling
pathways, including PI3K (see 601232), GSK3 (see 606784), and FKHR
(FOXO1A; 136533). T cells from mice lacking Ox40 were unable to maintain
PKB activity over time, and this loss of activity coincided with cell
death. Expression of active PKB in responding Ox40 -/- cells reversed
the survival defect. Song et al. (2004) concluded that the duration of
signaling needed for long-term survival is much longer than that needed
for proliferation.

Munks et al. (2004) found that stimulation of 4-1BB (TNFRSF9; 602250) in
mice at the time of a DNA prime, poxvirus vaccine, increased the number
of functional memory CD8 (see 186910) T cells that responded, while
stimulation of OX40 increased the number of antigen-specific CD4
(186940) T cells that responded. Stimulating both of these TNFRs
enhanced the CD8 response more than stimulating 4-1BB alone. Munks et
al. (2004) suggested that stimulating these receptors can improve the
response to a powerful virus vector and may be useful in vaccine
development.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Using a single dose of agonistic antibody against OX40, Bansal-Pakala et
al. (2001) were able to prevent tolerance induction and to break
existing tolerance or augment the reactivity of hyporesponsive T cells.
Bansal-Pakala et al. (2001) proposed that targeting OX40 and possibly
other members of the TNFR family might have benefits as adjuvants.

GENE STRUCTURE

Birkeland et al. (1995) determined the gene structure of mouse OX40,
which showed that there are several intron/exon bodies shared between
OX40 and CD27 (186711), CD40 (109535), TNFR1 (191190), and CD95
(134637).

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Latza et al. (1994) mapped the
ACT35 gene to 1p36, where the genes for TNFR2 (191191) and the lymphoid
activation antigen CD30 (153243) are located.

Birkeland et al. (1995) mapped the gene encoding murine OX40 to
chromosome 4 in an area that contains the gene for TNFR2 and shows
homology of synteny with the region of human chromosome 1 that contains
the genes for TNFR2, OX40, and CD30.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using Ox40 -/- mice and a mouse model of asthma, Jember et al. (2001)
found that wildtype mice had significantly higher eosinophilic
infiltrate in the bronchial fluid than did Ox40 -/- mice. The
Ox40-deficient mice also had significantly reduced levels of the Th2
cytokines IL4 (147780) and IL5 (147850), but no elevation in IFNG
(147570), in bronchial fluid, and antigen-specific and total IgE was
reduced in serum. Functional analysis indicated that wildtype mice had
pronounced airway hyperreactivity compared with Ox40 -/- mice.
Histologic analysis revealed marked cellular infiltrate around the
bronchioles of wildtype mice and a near absence of mucus production by
Ox40 -/- mice. Jember et al. (2001) concluded that OX40/OX40L
interactions are integral to the development of the asthmatic phenotype.
They proposed that strategies targeting both OX40 and CD28 (186760) may
be most effective in preventing the development of allergen-specific T
cells.

OX40 is not expressed on naive T cells, but it is upregulated within 2
days of antigen activation. Humphreys et al. (2003) showed that
influenza virus-induced weight loss and T-cell inflammation in mice
could be reduced by an Ox40-Ig fusion protein. Flow cytometric and
intracellular cytokine analysis demonstrated that the number and
proportion of Cd8-positive T cells producing Tnf were reduced in treated
mice. Delayed treatment also inhibited weight loss in mice with
established illness without affecting viral clearance or antigen recall
responses. Reduced proliferation and enhanced apoptosis of lung cells
accompanied the improved clinical phenotype. Humphreys et al. (2003)
concluded that interference with the late costimulatory pathway has
potential for the treatment of dysregulated immune responses in lung.

Shimojima et al. (2004) found that CD134 is the primary receptor for
feline immunodeficiency virus. CD134 expression promotes viral binding
and renders cells permissive for viral entry, productive infection, and
syncytium formation. Infection is CXCR4 (162643)-dependent, analogous to
infection with X4 strains of HIV.

603936	TITLE *603936 GROWTH/DIFFERENTIATION FACTOR 11; GDF11
;;BONE MORPHOGENETIC PROTEIN 11; BMP11
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

GDF9, or BMP11, is a member of the transforming growth factor-beta (see
TGFB1, 191080) superfamily of regulatory molecules.

CLONING

The bones that comprise the axial skeleton have distinct morphologic
features characteristic of their positions along the anterior/posterior
axis. McPherron et al. (1997) described a novel mouse TGF-beta family
member, myostatin, encoded by the Mstn gene (601788), that has an
essential role in regulating skeletal muscle mass. By low-stringency
screening, McPherron et al. (1997) also identified a gene related to
Mstn. The cloning of this gene, designated Gdf11, was also reported by
Gamer et al. (1999) and Nakashima et al. (1999).

GENE FUNCTION

McPherron et al. (1999) showed that Gdf11 has an important role in
establishing the patterning of the axial skeleton. They found that
during early mouse embryogenesis Gdf11 is expressed in the primitive
streak and tail bud regions, which are sites where new mesodermal cells
are generated. Homozygous mutant mice carrying a targeted deletion of
Gdf11 exhibited anteriorly directed homeotic transformations throughout
the axial skeleton and posterior displacement of the hindlimbs. The
effect of the mutation was dose dependent, as Gdf11 +/- mice had a
milder phenotype than Gdf11 -/- mice. Mutant embryos showed alterations
in patterns of Hox (see 142950) gene expression, suggesting that Gdf11
acts upstream of the Hox genes. McPherron et al. (1999) interpreted
their findings to indicate that Gdf11 is a secreted signal that acts
globally to specify positional identity along the anterior/posterior
axis. To their knowledge, Gdf11 was the first secreted protein to be
discovered that functions globally to regulate anterior/posterior axial
patterning. The homeotic transformations observed in Gdf11 mutant mice
were more extensive than those seen either by genetic manipulation of
presumed patterning genes or by administration of retinoic acid. The
question was raised of whether Gdf11 and retinoic acid interact to
regulate Hox gene expression and anterior/posterior patterning and
whether Gdf11 regulates the patterning of tissues other than those
studied by McPherron et al. (1999).

Kim et al. (2005) demonstrated that mouse Gdf11 controls the number of
retinal ganglion cells, as well as amacrine and photoreceptor cells,
that form during development. Gdf11 does not affect proliferation of
progenitors, a major role of Gdf11 action in other tissues, but instead
controls duration of expression of Math5 (ATOH7; 609876), a gene that
confers competence for retinal ganglion cell genesis, in progenitor
cells. Thus, Gdf11 governs the temporal windows during which multipotent
progenitors retain competence to produce distinct neural progeny.

ANIMAL MODEL

Wu et al. (2003) presented evidence that mouse Gdf11 is involved in an
inhibitory feedback mechanism that limits the generation of new neurons
by neuronal progenitors in the olfactory epithelium. In vitro, Gdf11
inhibits neurogenesis in olfactory epithelium progenitors by inducing
Kip1 (600778) and reversible cell cycle arrest. Mice lacking functional
Gdf11 had more olfactory epithelium progenitors and neurons, whereas
mice lacking follistatin (136470), a Gdf11 antagonist, had decreased
progenitors and neurons.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the GDF11
gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP stSG47458).

606414	TITLE *606414 INSULIN-LIKE 6; INSL6
;;RELAXIN/INSULIN-LIKE FACTOR 1; RIF1
DESCRIPTION Insulin gene superfamily hormones regulate cell growth, metabolism, and
tissue-specific functions. Members of this family are characterized by a
signal peptide, a B chain, a connecting C chain, and an A chain.

CLONING

By EST database searching for sequences with similarity to the B or A
chains of insulin (INS; 176730) and relaxin (RLN1; 179730), followed by
RACE-PCR, Hsu (1999) identified cDNAs encoding mouse and human INSL6.
The deduced 213-amino acid protein, which shares 45% sequence identity
with the mouse protein, contains the classic B-C-A domain configuration,
including the 6 cysteines in the B and A domains, of the insulin/relaxin
family proteins. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a 1.2-kb
transcript confined to testis. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated
expression restricted to interstitial cells in mouse testis.

Using similar methods, Lok et al. (2000) also cloned and characterized
INSL6. In situ hybridization analysis detected localization primarily in
rat and rhesus seminiferous tubules.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Lok et al. (2000) mapped the INSL6 gene
to chromosome 9p24, near the INSL4 (600910) and a proposed
'testis-determining factor' (see 154230) genes. By FISH, Hsu (1999)
mapped the mouse Insl6 gene to chromosome 19C3.

612890	TITLE *612890 LEUCINE-RICH REPEAT-CONTAINING PROTEIN 8D; LRRC8D
;;LEUCINE-RICH REPEAT-CONTAINING PROTEIN 5; LRRC5
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching protein and nucleotide databases for sequences similar to
LRRC8 (LRRC8A; 608360), followed by RT-PCR of peripheral blood
mononuclear cell and monocyte total RNA, Kubota et al. (2004) identified
LRRC8D as LRRC5. The deduced 858-amino acid protein contains 4
N-terminal transmembrane domains and 16 C-terminal leucine-rich repeats.
LRRC8D shares 55% identity with LRRC8A and 95% identity with the
859-amino acid mouse ortholog. Semiquantitative PCR detected variable
LRRC8D expression in all tissues examined except skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Kubota et al. (2004) found that expression of LRRC8D in isolated human
peripheral blood mononuclear cells or monocytes was increased following
exposure to phytohemagglutinin, phorbol ester, or lipopolysaccharide.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Kubota et al. (2004) mapped the LRRC8D
gene to chromosome 1p22.2. They mapped the mouse Lrrc8d gene to
chromosome 5.

611310	TITLE *611310 PHOSPHOSERYL-tRNA KINASE; PSTK
;;CHROMOSOME 10 OPEN READING FRAME; C10ORF89
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In eukaryotes, decoding of the UGA codon as selenocysteine (Sec)
requires a Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) in the 3-prime untranslated
region of the mRNA. A specific elongation factor, EFSEC (607695),
specifically recognizes selenocysteyl-tRNA(Ser)Sec and the SECIS and
directs insertion of Sec into protein. Carlson et al. (2004) performed a
computational search of archaeal and eukaryotic genomes to find
kinase-like genes that occurred in organisms with the Sec insertion
machinery but not in organisms lacking this machinery. They found 27
ORFs that were further screened for homology to known kinase domains and
proteins in the National Center for Biotechnology Information
nonredundant database. They identified a novel protein, designated PSTK,
that had homologs in eurkaryotes with a functional Sec insertion system,
but not in those lacking this sytem. The PSTK cDNA was isolated and
cloned into a His-tag expression vector. The deduced human PSTK protein
contains 359 amino acids with a predicted ATP-binding domain. It shares
80% sequence identity with the mouse homolog.

GENE FUNCTION

Carlson et al. (2004) demonstrated that PSTK specifically catalyzed the
formation of phosphoseryl-tRNA(Ser)Sec from seryl-tRNA(Ser)Sec and ATP
in the presence of Mg2+. In binding assays, both tRNA(Ser)Sec and
seryl-tRNA(Ser)Sec bound to PSTK, but ATP enhanced the binding of
tRNA(Ser)Sec and decreased the binding of seryl-tRNA(Ser)Sec. Carlson et
al. (2004) suggested that PSTK plays an important role in selenoprotein
biosynthesis and/or regulation.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PSTK
gene to chromosome 10 (TMAP RH94240).

609051	TITLE *609051 CASPASE RECRUITMENT DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 8; CARD8
;;TUMOR-UPREGULATED CARD-CONTAINING ANTAGONIST OF CASP9; TUCAN;;
CARD INHIBITOR OF NFKB-ACTIVATING LIGANDS; CARDINAL;;
NDPP1;;
KIAA0955
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Caspase recruitment domain (CARD)-containing proteins, such as CARD8,
are involved in pathways leading to activation of caspases or nuclear
factor kappa-B (NFKB; see 164011) in the context of apoptosis or
inflammation, respectively (Bouchier-Hayes et al., 2001).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned CARD8, which they designated
KIAA0955. The transcript contains several repetitive elements in the
3-prime UTR, and the deduced protein contains 431 amino acids. RT-PCR
ELISA detected highest expression of CARD8 in kidney and corpus callosum
and lowest expression in pancreas. All other tissues and specific brain
regions examined showed intermediate expression.

By searching databases for sequences similar to the CARD domain of APAF1
(602233), followed by PCR, Pathan et al. (2001) cloned CARD8, which they
designated TUCAN. CARD8 contains an N-terminal segment that shares 50%
amino acid identity with a region of the proapoptotic protein DEFCAP
(NALP1; 606636), as well as a C-terminal CARD domain.

By Western blot analysis of several tissues, Bouchier-Hayes et al.
(2001) found CARD8 expressed at an apparent molecular mass of 50 kD,
close to the predicted molecular mass of 49 kD. Highest expression was
in lung, ovary, testis, and placenta, with low or absent expression in
brain, skeletal muscle, and spleen.

By RT-PCR, Razmara et al. (2002) found highest CARD8 expression in
placenta, spleen, lymph node, and bone marrow.

By EST analysis, Zhang and Fu (2002) identified 5 splice variants of
CARD8, which they called NDPP1. The variants all have different
translation start sites.

Yamamoto et al. (2005) cloned a splice variant of CARD8 that they named
TUCAN54 after the calculated molecular mass of the encoded protein. The
deduced 487-amino acid TUCAN54 protein has a unique 80-amino acid N
terminus compared with the 48-kD isoform, TUCAN48, but both proteins
contain a NALP homology domain, a candidate caspase cleavage site
(DEED), a C-terminal CARD domain, and several putative phosphorylation
sites. The N terminus of TUCAN54 provides phosphorylation sites not
found in TUCAN48. RT-PCR detected high TUCAN54 expression in leukocytes
and spleen. Expression was lower in heart, lung, thymus, liver,
pancreas, and testis, and little to no expression was detected in other
tissues examined. TUCAN54 was widely expressed in a variety of tumor
cell lines.

By EST database and RT-PCR analyses, Bagnall et al. (2008) characterized
5 isoforms of CARD8 that differ in their N termini and have predicted
molecular masses of 47.5, 48, 51, 54, and 60 kD. The major 48-kD isoform
has 432 amino acids and starts in exon 5, and the 54-kD isoform has 487
amino acids and starts in exon 4. The 47.5-kD isoform differs in the
first 20 amino acids from the 48-kD isoform and results from a putative
initiation codon 20 bp upstream of exon 6. Western blot analysis of
lymphoblastoid cell lines from 6 Crohn disease (see IBD1; 266600)
patients showed a 48- or 47.5-kD band in all cell lines and an
additional band of 54 kD in only 1 cell line.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhang and Fu (2002) determined that the CARD8 gene contains 14 exons and
spans more than 50 kb. The first 3 exons are noncoding.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Zhang and Fu (2002) mapped the CARD8 gene
to chromosome 19q13.3.

GENE FUNCTION

By overexpression in Jurkat human T cells, Pathan et al. (2001) found
that CARD8 inhibited apoptosis and caspase activation induced by APAF1-
and CASP9 (602234)-dependent stimuli but not APAF1- and
CASP9-independent stimuli. Immunohistochemical analysis detected
elevated CARD8 immunostaining in 42 of 66 (64%) colon cancer specimens
compared with the adjacent normal tissues. Higher endogenous CARD8
immunostaining correlated with shorter patient survival.

Bouchier-Hayes et al. (2001) found that CARD8 suppressed NFKB activation
associated with overexpression of NFKB activators or with ligand-induced
stimulation of IL1 receptor (see 147810) or TNF receptor (see 191190).
Coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that CARD8 interacted with
the regulatory subunit of the I-kappa-B kinase complex, IKK-gamma
(IKBKG; 300248). Bouchier-Hayes et al. (2001) concluded that CARD8 is a
regulator of NFKB activation in the context of proinflammatory signals.

Razmara et al. (2002) found that CARD8 mediated apoptosis.
Overexpression of CARD8 induced apoptosis in transfected breast cancer
and green monkey kidney cells. In contrast to the findings of Pathan et
al. (2001), inhibitor studies by Razmara et al. (2002) indicated that
apoptosis was induced by CARD8 via the APAF1/CASP9 apoptotic complex.
CARD8 also suppressed NFKB activation by diverse stimuli, and stable
CARD8 expression sensitized monocytes to differentiation-induced
apoptosis. Razmara et al. (2002) found that CARD8 bound CASP1 (147678)
and negatively regulated CASP1-dependent IL1B secretion in monocytes. In
addition, CARD8 bound the CASP1 inhibitors ICEBERG (605354) and
pseudo-ICE. Razmara et al. (2002) concluded that CARD8 may be an adaptor
molecule that regulates CASP1 activation, NFKB activation, and
apoptosis.

Zhang and Fu (2002) found that expression of CARD8 blocked BAX
(600040)-induced apoptosis in several human cell lines and in rat
embryonic fibroblasts. TNF-alpha-induced NFKB activation was suppressed
in a CARD8-transfected hepatoma cell line.

Agostini et al. (2004) noted that NALP1, unlike other short NALP
proteins, contains a C-terminal CARD domain that interacts with and
activates CASP5 (602665). CASP1 and CASP5 are activated when they
assemble with NALP1 and ASC (PYCARD; 606838) to form the inflammasome,
which is responsible for processing the inactive IL1B (147720) precursor
(proIL1B) to release active IL1B cytokine. Using immunoprecipitation
analysis, Agostini et al. (2004) found that CARD8, which contains
C-terminal FIIND (function to find) and CARD domains, associated with
constructs of NALP2 (609364) and NALP3 (CIAS1; 606416) lacking the
N-terminal pyrin domain and/or the C-terminal leucine-rich repeat
domain. They determined that the interaction was mediated by the FIIND
domain of CARD8 and the centrally located NACHT domain of NALP2 and
NALP3. The pyrin domain of NALP2 and NALP3, like that of NALP1,
interacted with the pyrin domain of ASC, which recruits CASP1.
Transfection experiments showed that an inflammasome could be assembled
containing ASC, CARD8, CASP1, and a short NALP, resulting in activation
of CASP1, but not CASP5, and strong processing of proIL1B.

Yamamoto et al. (2005) found that overexpression of TUCAN54 in human
cell lines inhibited pro-CASP9 activation and suppressed apoptosis
induced by staurosporin, a protein kinase inhibitor, and by etoposide, a
chemotherapeutic reagent. In contrast, suppression of TUCAN54 expression
via small interfering RNA increased etoposide-induced cell death.
TUCAN54 also inhibited CASP8 (601763) activation, thereby suppressing
FAS (TNFRSF6; 134637)-induced cell death. TUCAN48 inhibited CASP9
activation and, more weakly, CASP8 activation, but only TUCAN54
physically associated with FADD (602457). FADD constitutively associated
with pro-CASP8 in transfected cells, suggesting that TUCAN54 inhibits
pro-CASP8 activation by forming a molecular complex with FADD and
pro-CASP8.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using RNA from lymphoblastoid cell lines of Crohn disease patients,
Bagnall et al. (2008) showed that an A-to-T transversion in exon 5 of
the CARD8 gene (dbSNP rs2043211), predicted to result in a cys10-to-ter
(C10X) substitution in the 48-kD isoform of CARD8, did not affect the
47.5-kD isoform. Patients who were TT homozygous showed somewhat reduced
expression of CARD8 mRNA, but expressed a 47.5-kD protein. The authors
showed that the dbSNP rs2043211 variant had multiple outcomes including
unaffected, cys10 to ter, cys34 to ter, phe52 to ile, and phe102 to ile.
Bagnall et al. (2008) noted that the multiple isoforms and differing
consequences for a predicted stop codon polymorphism underline the
importance of detailed analysis of the effects of proposed functional
variants on gene expression.

Using a genomewide screen of Salmonella typhimurium-infected HapMap
lymphoblastoid cells from individuals of northern and western European
or Nigerian ancestry, Ko et al. (2009) identified a loss-of-function
allele of CARD8 (cys10 to ter; dbSNP rs2043211) that was associated with
increased cell death in vitro. Overexpression of alternative alleles and
RNA interference analysis supported the association. Genotyping of
individuals with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) showed a
modestly increased risk with the variant. Ko et al. (2009) proposed that
loss of CARD8 function and an increased inflammatory response may
protect against Salmonella but lead to increased inflammatory disease.

603286	TITLE *603286 KISS1 METASTASIS SUPPRESSOR; KISS1
;;METASTIN;;
KISSPEPTIN
DESCRIPTION KISS1 is a human metastasis suppressor gene that suppresses metastases
of melanomas and breast carcinomas without affecting tumorigenicity.

CLONING

Welch et al. (1994) found that microcell-mediated transfer of human
chromosome 6 into human metastatic melanoma cells (C8161 or MelJuSo)
suppressed their ability to metastasize in athymic nude mice by at least
95% without affecting the tumorigenicity of the cells. Using a modified
subtractive hybridization approach, Lee et al. (1996) isolated a cDNA
expressed in hybrid chromosome 6-C8161 cells but not in parental C8161
cells. They designated the cDNA KISS1, combining laboratory nomenclature
for putative suppressor sequences with acknowledgment of the gene's
discovery in Hershey, Pennsylvania. Lee et al. (1996) reported the
sequence of the predicted KISS1 protein and a corrected sequence in a
published erratum. The KISS1 protein consists of 145 amino acids.
Northern blot analysis revealed that KISS1 was expressed as a 1-kb mRNA
in chromosome 6-C8161 hybrid cell lines as well as in normal placenta
tissue. Low levels of smaller transcripts were observed in pancreas and
kidney. Lee et al. (1996) did not detect KISS1 expression in any cell
line capable of metastasizing in athymic nude mice.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), Lee et al. (1996) mapped
the KISS1 gene to 1q32-q41. They suggested that a metastasis-suppressing
gene or genes on chromosome 6 regulate KISS1. By radiation hybrid
mapping and FISH, West et al. (1998) localized the KISS1 gene to 1q32.

GENE FUNCTION

Lee et al. (1996) observed that expression of KISS1 in C8161 melanoma
cells suppressed metastasis, suggesting that KISS1 plays a role in the
regulation of cancer metastasis in human malignant melanoma. Lee and
Welch (1997) demonstrated that expression of KISS1 in human breast
carcinoma cells reduced metastatic potential by 95% compared to control
cells but did not suppress tumorigenicity. The authors concluded that
KISS1 also functions as a metastasis suppressor gene in at least some
human breast cancers.

Ohtaki et al. (2001) demonstrated that KISS1 encodes a
carboxy-terminally amidated peptide with 54 amino acid residues, which
they isolated from human placenta as the endogenous ligand of an orphan
G protein-coupled receptor (GPR54; 604161). They named the truncated
form of KISS1 'metastin.' Metastin inhibits chemotaxis and invasion of
GPR54-transfected CHO cells in vitro and attenuates pulmonary metastasis
of GPR54-transfected B16-BL6 melanomas in vivo.

Using real-time PCR, Shahab et al. (2005) found that expression of Kiss1
mRNA increased with puberty in both male and female rhesus monkeys.
Kisspeptin-10 (112-121), a decapeptide derived from KISS1, was
administered to agonadal juvenile monkeys and induced a GnRH (152760)
response as measured by a surge in plasma luteinizing hormone (LH; see
152780). In intact females, but not in agonadal males, the level of
Gpr54 mRNA in the hypothalamus increased about 3-fold from the juvenile
to midpubertal stage. In situ hybridization detected robust Kiss1 and
Gpr54 expression in the arcuate nucleus. Shahab et al. (2005) concluded
that KISS1 signaling through GPR54 in the primate hypothalamus at the
end of the juvenile phase of development may contribute to the pubertal
resurgence of pulsatile GnRH release.

Kinoshita et al. (2005) examined whether metastin, the product of
metastasis suppressor gene KISS1, is a central neuropeptide regulating
GnRH/LH surge and then estrous cyclicity in the female rat. Injection of
metastin into the third ventricle or preoptic area increased plasma LH
concentrations in estrogen-primed ovariectomized rats, demonstrating
that metastin profoundly stimulates LH secretion by acting on the
preoptic area, where most GnRH neurons projecting to the median eminence
are located. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated metastin neurons
in the arcuate nucleus colocalized with estrogen receptors, with some
fibers in the preoptic area in close apposition with GnRH neuronal cell
bodies or fibers. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed KISS1 and GPR54 (606161)
mRNAs expressed in the arcuate nucleus and preoptic area, respectively.
The blockade of local metastin action in the preoptic area with a
specific monoclonal antibody to rat metastin completely abolished
proestrous LH surge and inhibited estrous cyclicity. In the arcuate
nucleus, numbers of metastin-immunoreactive cell bodies and c-Fos
(164810) expression were significantly higher in the early proestrus
afternoon compared with the day of diestrus. Thus, Kinoshita et al.
(2005) concluded that metastin released in the preoptic area is involved
in inducing the preovulatory LH surge and regulating estrous cyclicity.

Navarro et al. (2005) studied the effect of KISS1 peptide on LH
secretion using in vitro and in vivo settings under different
experimental conditions. Central intracerebroventricular administration
of KISS1 peptide potently elicited LH secretion in vivo over a range of
doses from 10 pmol to 1 nmol. The effect of centrally injected KISS1
appeared to be mediated via the hypothalamic LHRH. However, no effect of
central administration of KISS1 was detected on relative LHRH mRNA
levels. Likewise, systemic (either intraperitoneal or intravascular)
injection of KISS1 markedly stimulated LH secretion. Navarro et al.
(2005) found that LH-releasing activity of KISS1 was persistently
observed after blockade of endogenous excitatory amino acid and nitric
oxide pathways, i.e., relevant neurotransmitters in the neuroendocrine
control of LH secretion. Navarro et al. (2005) concluded that their
results provided solid evidence for a potent stimulatory effect of KISS1
on LH release, acting at central levels (likely the hypothalamus) and
eventually at the pituitary, and further documented a novel role of the
KISS1/GPR54 system as a relevant downstream element in the
neuroendocrine network governing LH secretion.

Smith et al. (2005) found that KISS1 neurons in the arcuate nucleus,
which are inhibited by estradiol, may play a role in the negative
feedback regulation of GnRH secretion, whereas KISS1 neurons in the
anteroventral periventricular nucleus, which are stimulated by
estradiol, may participate in the positive feedback regulation of GnRH
secretion.

Navarro et al. (2005) studied the effects of KISS1 peptide on FSH (see
136530) secretion in vivo and in vitro. Intracerebroventricular
administration of KISS1 peptide significantly stimulated FSH secretion
in prepubertal and adult rats. Yet, dose-response analyses in vivo
demonstrated an ED50 value for the FSH-releasing effects of KISS1 of 400
pmol, i.e., approximately 100-fold higher than that of LH. In addition,
systemic injection of KISS1 significantly stimulated FSH secretion in
vivo. However, KISS1 failed to elicit basal FSH release directly at the
pituitary level, although it moderately enhanced GnRH-stimulated FSH
secretion in vitro. Finally, Navarro et al. (2005) reported that
mechanistic studies revealed that the ability of KISS1 to elicit FSH
secretion was abolished by the blockade of endogenous GnRH actions, but
it was persistently observed in different models of leptin (164160)
insufficiency and after blockade of endogenous excitatory amino acid and
nitric oxide pathways, relevant signals in the neuroendocrine control of
gonadotropin secretion. In summary, Navarro et al. (2005) concluded that
their results extended previous observations on the role of KISS1 in the
control of LH secretion and provided solid evidence for a stimulatory
effect of KISS1 on FSH release, acting at a central level.

In a study of 6 healthy male volunteers, Dhillo et al. (2005) found that
elevation of plasma concentrations of kisspeptin significantly increased
circulating LH, FSH, and testosterone levels. Dhillo et al. (2005)
suggested that kisspeptin infusion may provide a novel mechanism for
hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis manipulation in disorders of the
reproductive system.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a consanguineous Kurdish family in which 4 sisters had normosmic
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH13; 614842), Topaloglu et al. (2012)
identified homozygosity for a missense mutation in the KISS1 gene
(603286.0001) that segregated with the disease and was not found in 100
ethnically matched controls. Subsequent analysis of KISS1 in 12
additional families with normosmic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and in
90 sporadic cases revealed no mutations.

ANIMAL MODEL

D'Anglemont de Tassigny et al. (2007) generated Kiss1-null mice that
were viable and healthy with no apparent abnormalities but failed to
undergo sexual maturation. Mutant female mice did not progress through
the estrous cycle, had thread-like uteri and small ovaries, and did not
produce mature Graffian follicles. Mutant males had small testes, and
spermatogenesis arrested mainly at the early haploid spermatid stage.
Both sexes had low circulating gonadotropin (LH and FSH) and sex steroid
(beta-estradiol or testosterone) hormone levels. Migration of GnRH
neurons into the hypothalamus appeared normal with appropriate axonal
connections to the median eminence and total GnRH content. The
hypothalamic-pituitary axis was functional, as shown by robust LH
secretion after peripheral administration of kisspeptin. D'Anglemont de
Tassigny et al. (2007) stated that the phenotypes of Gpr54- and
Kiss1-null mice are virtually identical, providing direct proof that
kisspeptins are the true physiologic ligand for the GPR54 receptor in
vivo. The authors also noted that apart from activation of the
hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, KISS1 does not seem to play a vital
role in any other physiologic processes, and loss of KISS1 cannot be
overcome by compensatory mechanisms.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 13 WITHOUT ANOSMIA
KISS1, ASN115LYS

In 4 affected sisters from a consanguineous Kurdish family with
normosmic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH13; 614842), Topaloglu et al.
(2012) identified homozygosity for a 345C-G transversion in the KISS1
gene, resulting in an asn115-to-lys (N115K) substitution at a highly
conserved residue. The unaffected parents were heterozygous for the
mutation, and unaffected sibs were heterozygous or homozygous for
wildtype. The mutation was not found in 100 ethnically matched controls.
Functional studies showed that human KISS1R (604161) had significantly
reduced sensitivity to mutant kisspeptin-10, and mutant kisspeptin-10
was unable to stimulate a maximal inositol phosphate response at any
concentration tested, indicating significantly reduced efficacy as well
as potency.

607147	TITLE *607147 POLIOVIRUS RECEPTOR-LIKE 3; PVRL3
;;POLIOVIRUS RECEPTOR-RELATED 3; PVRR3; PRR3;;
NECTIN 3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Nectins (e.g., PVRL1, 600644) are immunoglobulin-like adhesion molecules
that interact with afadin (AF6; 159559). Afadin is an actin
filament-binding protein that connects nectins to the actin
cytoskeleton. The nectin-afadin system organizes adherens junctions
cooperatively with the cadherin (see 192090)-catenin (see 116805) system
in epithelial cells.

CLONING

By searching an EST database using PRR1, PRR2 (PVRL2; 600798), and PVR
(173850) as queries, followed by RT-PCR of placenta mRNA, Reymond et al.
(2000) cloned a full-length cDNA encoding PRR3. The deduced 550-amino
acid PRR3 protein has a calculated molecular mass of 55.4 kD and
contains an N-terminal hydrophobic leader sequence; an ectodomain
containing a V-type Ig domain and 2 C-type Ig domains bracketed by 6
cysteine residues; a hydrophobic transmembrane region; and a long
cytoplasmic sequence. PRR3 also has 6 potential N-glycosylation sites.
Northern blot analysis revealed PRR3 expression predominantly in
placenta and testis, with faint or no expression in other tissues. A
major transcript of 2.8 kb and minor transcripts of 9.5, 6.0, and 4.7 kb
were detected in placenta. PRR3 was also expressed in mammalian
epithelial cell lines. Flow cytometry showed expression of PRR3 at the
surface of transfected COS-1 cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using coimmunoprecipitation experiments, Reymond et al. (2000) found
that PRR3 interacts with both the L- and S-afadin isoforms in a similar
ratio.

Using immunolocalization of adult mouse hippocampal sections Mizoguchi
et al. (2002) found that the nectin-afadin system colocalizes with the
cadherin-catenin system at synapses between mossy fiber terminals and
dendrites of pyramidal cells in the CA3 area. Nectins-1 and -3
asymmetrically localize at the pre- and postsynaptic sides of puncta
adherentia junctions, respectively. During development, nectins-1 and -3
asymmetrically localize not only at puncta adherentia junctions but also
at synaptic junctions. Using rat hippocampal neurons in culture,
Mizoguchi et al. (2002) observed that inhibition of the nectin-based
adhesion results in a decrease in synapse size and a concomitant
increase in synapse number.

Togashi et al. (2011) found that mouse hair cells and supporting cells
express the immunoglobulin-like adhesion molecules nectin-1 (600644) and
-3, respectively, and that their interaction mediates the heterotypic
adhesion between these 2 cell types. Genetic removal of nectin-1 or -3
disrupted the checkerboard-like pattern, inducing aberrant attachment
between hair cells. When cells expressing either nectin-1 or -3 were
cocultured, they arranged themselves into a mosaic pattern. Thus,
Togashi et al. (2011) concluded that nectin-1 and nectin-3 promote the
formation of the checkerboard-like pattern of the auditory epithelia.

ANIMAL MODEL

Inagaki et al. (2006) found that male, but not female, nectin-3 -/- mice
were infertile. Phase contrast microscopy revealed that spermatozoa of
mutant mice showed severe malformation of the head and midpiece.
Nectin-3 knockout resulted in defects in the later steps of sperm
morphogenesis, including distorted nuclei and abnormal distribution of
mitochondria, as well as loss of nectin-2 (PVRL2; 600798) at
Sertoli-spermatid junctions. The localization of nectin-2 at
Sertoli-Sertoli junctions was unaffected.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PVRL3
gene to chromosome 3 (TMAP stSG2552).

606130	TITLE *606130 RING FINGER PROTEIN 26; RNF26
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The RING finger motif is a distinct zinc-chelating domain involved in
mediating protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions. RING finger
proteins are involved in a variety of functions such as oncogenesis,
signal transduction, peroxisome biogenesis, viral infection,
development, transcriptional repression, and ubiquitination. RNF26 is a
member of the C3HC5 RING finger subfamily.

CLONING

By use of a genomic fragment from a chromosome 11q23 contig and EST
database searching, Katoh (2001) cloned an RNF26 cDNA encoding a deduced
433-amino acid protein with an N-terminal leucine zipper domain and a
C-terminal RING finger domain. Its RING finger domain is 49% homologous
to that of CGR19 (606138), another C3HC5 RING finger protein. Northern
blot analysis detected ubiquitous expression of a 3.2-kb transcript in
adult and fetal human tissues. Expression of RNF26 was upregulated in
various human cancer cell lines, including promyelocytic leukemia,
cervical uterine cancer, colorectal cancer, and gastric cancer cell
lines, and in 3 of 6 primary gastric cancers.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Katoh (2001) mapped the RNF26 gene to chromosome
11q23.

607788	TITLE *607788 MULTIPLE COAGULATION FACTOR DEFICIENCY PROTEIN 2; MCFD2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Deka et al. (1988) cloned a gene they designated T+ due to the presence
of a transposon-like human repeat element (THE1) in the unusually long
3-prime untranslated region. The deduced protein contains 79 amino acids
and shares significant similarity with troponin-c (see 191040) and
calmodulin (see 114180) within a conserved 12-amino acid motif. Deka et
al. (1988) also identified a transcribed pseudogene, which they called
T-, that contains an interspersed Alu repeat instead of the THE1
element. Northern blot analysis of tissues and cell lines detected major
transcripts of 4.0, 3.0, 1.9, and 0.85 kb. A 2.5-kb transcript was also
detected in a neuroblastoma sample. The 4.0- and 1.9-kb transcripts were
present in HeLa cell polysome fractions, leading the authors to conclude
that they are likely translated.

Using a positional cloning strategy, Zhang et al. (2003) searched for
the gene responsible for the form of combined deficiency of factor V and
factor VIII that mapped to the region 2p21-p16.3 (F5F8D2; 613625). The
candidate genetic interval of approximately 2.4 Mb in the draft human
genome sequence contained about 20 known and predicted genes and a
number of partial ESTs, none of which had sequence homology to known
components of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or Golgi. Direct DNA
sequencing of individual candidate genes identified mutations in the
predicted exons and intron-exon junctions of a partial cDNA, HUMTRANSC,
previously reported based on its unusually long 3-prime untranslated
region containing a THE1. This gene, renamed MCFD2 (multiple coagulation
factor deficiency protein-2) by Zhang et al. (2003), contains a
145-amino acid open reading frame and is identical to the T+ gene
reported by Deka et al. (1988). Notable features include a predicted
signal peptide at the N terminus and 2 calmodulin-like EF-hands for
putative calcium binding at the C terminus. Northern blot analysis
showed that MCFD2 is expressed in multiple tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhang et al. (2003) showed that MCFD2 and the LMAN1 gene, which is
mutant in the most common form of F5F8D (F5F8D1; 227300), colocalize in
the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and
that MCFD2 is localized to the ERGIC through a direct, calcium-dependent
interaction with LMAN1.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhang et al. (2003) determined that the MCFD2 gene contains 4 exons
encompassing approximately 19 kb of genomic DNA. Deka et al. (1988)
determined that the promoter region of the MCFD2 gene contains a CAAT
element and a TATA element. The THE1 element is oriented in the reverse
direction of the gene.

MAPPING

Zhang et al. (2003) identified the MCFD2 gene within a critical region
on chromosome 2p21-p16.3 associated with F5F8D.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Zhang et al. (2003) identified 7 distinct mutations in the MCFD2 gene
accounting for F5F8D in 9 of 12 families. The affected individual in 1
of these families was 1 of the original F5F8D probands reported by Oeri
et al. (1954). Most of the mutations resulted in a null allele with
complete lack of protein expression (607788.0001-607788.0005). The other
2 mutations were missense (607788.0006-607788.0007). In vitro functional
expression studies in HeLa cells showed that LMAN1 did not
coimmunoprecipitate with missense mutant MCFD2. The results suggested an
essential role for the second EF-hand of MCFD2 in the calcium-dependent
interaction with LMAN1 and the subsequent function of the MCFD2-LMAN1
complex in the transport of factor V and factor VIII.

Zhang et al. (2008) identified 4 different MCFD2 mutations (see, e.g.,
607788.0008) in affected members of 4 families with combined factor V
and factor VIII deficiency. The families were of Greek, Afro-Caribbean,
Saudi Arabian, and Italian descent.

;;REV-ERBA-ALPHA-RELATED RECEPTOR; RVR;;
REV-ERBA-BETA;;
REV-ERB-BETA;;
BD73
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Dumas et al. (1994) used PCR with primers from conserved regions of
nuclear hormone receptor superfamily genes to identify a new member of
this superfamily, which they called BD73. The amino acid sequence of
BD73 is 96% identical to Rev-ErbA-alpha in the DNA-binding domain and
72% identical in the ligand-binding domain. Northern blot analysis
showed a 4.5-kb transcript present in variable amounts in a variety of
tissues and cell lines.

GENE FUNCTION

Dumas et al. (1994) showed that, in vitro, the BD73 protein has
DNA-binding activity to a specific A/T-rich sequence.

Toward a system-level understanding of the transcriptional circuitry
regulating circadian clocks, Ueda et al. (2005) identified
clock-controlled elements on 16 clock and clock-controlled genes in a
comprehensive surveillance of evolutionarily conserved cis elements and
measurement of the transcriptional dynamics. Ueda et al. (2005) found
that E boxes (CACGTG) and E-prime boxes (CACGTT) controlled the
expression of Per1 (602260), Nr1d2, Per2 (603426), Nr1d1 (602408), Dbp
(124097), Bhlhb2 (604256), and Bhlhb3 (606200) transcription following a
repressor-precedes-activator pattern, resulting in delayed
transcriptional activity. RevErbA/ROR (600825)-binding elements
regulated the transcriptional activity of Arntl (602550), Npas2
(603347), Nfil3 (605327), Clock (601851), Cry1 (601933), and Rorc
(602943) through a repressor-precedes-activator pattern as well.
DBP/E4BP4-binding elements controlled the expression of Per1, Per2, Per3
(603427), Nr1d1, Nr1d2, Rora, and Rorb (601972) through a
repressor-antiphasic-to-activator mechanism, which generates
high-amplitude transcriptional activity. Ueda et al. (2005) suggested
that regulation of E/E-prime boxes is a topologic vulnerability in
mammalian circadian clocks, a concept that had been functionally
verified using in vitro phenotype assay systems.

Solt et al. (2012) identified potent synthetic REV-ERB agonists with in
vivo activity. Administration of synthetic REV-ERB ligands alters
circadian behavior and the circadian pattern of core clock gene
expression in the hypothalami of mice. The circadian pattern of
expression of an array of metabolic genes in the liver, skeletal muscle,
and adipose tissue was also altered, resulting in increased energy
expenditure. Treatment of diet-induced obese mice with a REV-ERB agonist
decreased obesity by reducing fat mass and markedly improving
dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia.

Cho et al. (2012) determined the genomewide cis-acting targets of both
REV-ERB isoforms in murine liver, which revealed shared recognition at
over 50% of their total DNA binding sites and extensive overlap with the
master circadian regulator BMAL1. Although REV-ERB-alpha has been shown
to regulate BMAL1 expression directly, cistromic analysis revealed a
more profound connection between BMAL1 and the REV-ERB-alpha and
REV-ERB-beta genomic regulatory circuits than was previously suspected.
Genes within the intersection of the BMAL1, REV-ERB-alpha, and
REV-ERB-beta cistromes are highly enriched for both clock and metabolic
functions. As predicted by the cistromic analysis, dual depletion of
REV-ERB-alpha and REV-ERB-beta function by creating double-knockout mice
profoundly disrupted circadian expression of core circadian clock and
lipid homeostatic gene networks. As a result, double-knockout mice
showed markedly altered circadian wheel-running behavior and deregulated
lipid metabolism. Cho et al. (2012) concluded that their data united
REV-ERB-alpha and REV-ERB-beta with PER, CRY, and other components of
the principal feedback loop that drives circadian expression and
indicated a more integral mechanism for the coordination of circadian
rhythm and metabolism.

Lam et al. (2013) presented evidence that in mouse macrophages Rev-Erbs
regulate target gene expression by inhibiting the functions of distal
enhancers that are selected by macrophage lineage-determining factors,
thereby establishing a macrophage-specific program of repression. The
repressive functions of Rev-Erbs are associated with their ability to
inhibit the transcription of enhancer-derived RNAs (eRNAs). Furthermore,
targeted degradation of eRNAs at 2 enhancers subject to negative
regulation by Rev-Erbs resulted in reduced expression of nearby mRNAs,
suggesting a direct role of these eRNAs in enhancer function. By
precisely defining eRNA start sites using a modified form of global
run-on sequencing that quantifies nascent 5-prime ends, Lam et al.
(2013) showed that transfer of full enhancer activity to a target
promoter requires both the sequences mediating transcription factor
binding and the specific sequences encoding the eRNA transcript. Lam et
al. (2013) concluded that their studies provided evidence for a direct
role of eRNAs in contributing to enhancer function and suggested that
Rev-Erbs act to suppress gene expression at a distance by repressing
eRNA transcription.

MAPPING

Using YAC mapping and FISH, Koh and Moore (1999) mapped the NR1D2 gene
to chromosome 3p24.3-p24.2.

EVOLUTION

Koh and Moore (1999) noted that the THRA (190120), NR1D1 (602408), and
RARA (180240) genes are linked on chromosome 17q, and that the NR1D1
gene overlaps an exon of the THRA gene on the opposite strand. They
found that THRB (190160), NR1D2, and RARB (180220) are similarly linked
and oriented on chromosome 3p. The ancestral genes were duplicated
before the divergence of vertebrates, since at least the TRs and RARs
are also duplicated in birds and amphibians.

611883	TITLE *611883 BRCA2- AND CDKN1A-INTERACTING PROTEIN; BCCIP
;;p21- AND CDK-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1; TOK1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using the C-terminal half of p21 (CDK1A; 116899) as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen of a brain cDNA library, Ono et al. (2000) cloned BCCIP,
which they called TOK1. EST database analysis and PCR of a brain cDNA
library revealed 2 TOK1 variants, TOK1-alpha and -beta. The deduced
proteins contain 322 and 314 amino acids, respectively, and are
identical for the first 259 amino acids. Northern blot analysis using a
probe common to both TOK1 variants detected a major 1.5-kb transcript
and a minor 3-kb transcript. Specific probes detected both TOK1 variants
as 1.5-kb transcripts. TOK1-alpha was highly expressed in skeletal
muscle, with little to no expression in other tissues examined.
TOK1-beta was highly expressed in skeletal muscle and heart, moderately
expressed in placenta and pancreas, and weakly expressed in brain,
kidney, and liver. Western blot analysis detected TOK1-alpha and
TOK1-beta as 50- and 45-kD proteins, respectively. In synchronized HeLa
cells, expression of TOK1-alpha began after G2/M phase and peaked before
S phase. TOK1-beta was expressed throughout the cell cycle, but like
TOK1-alpha, its expression increased before S phase.

Using an internal conserved region of BRCA2 (600185) as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen, followed by database analysis, Liu et al. (2001) cloned
BCCIP-alpha and -beta, which correspond to TOK1-alpha and -beta,
respectively. Both BCCIP isoforms have an N-terminal acidic domain and
an evolutionarily conserved internal domain, followed by the C-terminal
variable domain. The internal domain contains a putative calcium-binding
domain. Western blot analysis detected both BCCIP proteins in all
tissues examined. Immunohistochemical analysis of several human cell
lines showed nuclear expression of endogenous BCCIP.

GENE FUNCTION

Using mutation analysis, Ono et al. (2000) found that TOK1-alpha bound
to the C-terminal proximal region of p21. However, TOK1-beta did not
bind p21. TOK1-alpha formed a ternary complex with p21 and an active
form of CDK2 (116953) in human embryonic kidney cells via its
interaction with p21. TOK1-alpha enhanced the inhibitory activity of p21
toward the histone H1 (see 142709) kinase activity of CDK2.

By coimmunoprecipitation analysis of transfected human embryonic kidney
cells, Liu et al. (2001) confirmed that BCCIP-alpha interacted with
endogenous BRCA2. Expression of BCCIP-beta protein was relatively
consistent among various tumor cell lines examined. In contrast,
expression of BCCIP-alpha protein was reduced in some brain, breast, and
endometrial tumor cell lines and increased in some endometrial tumor
cell lines, with relatively consistent expression among lung cancer cell
lines. BCCIP-alpha expression inhibited growth of some breast and brain
tumor cells, but it had no effect on other types of cancer cells.

Lu et al. (2007) stated that BCCIP regulates BRCA2 and RAD51 (179617)
nuclear focus formation, DNA double-strand break-induced homologous
recombination, and cell cycle progression. They transfected full-length
and truncated fragments of BCCIP into a human fibrosarcoma cell line and
found that BCCIP fragments that interacted with either BRCA2 or p21
inhibited homologous recombination similarly. Transient downregulation
of BCCIP in human cells did not affect nonspecific integration of
transfected DNA, but it significantly inhibited homology-directed gene
targeting. Cells with constitutive downregulation of BCCIP showed
increased levels of spontaneous single-stranded DNA and double-strand
breaks. Lu et al. (2007) concluded that multiple domains of BCCIP are
involved in homologous recombination and that BCCIP plays a critical
role in resolving spontaneous DNA damage.

Using a matched normal/tumor cDNA array, Meng et al. (2003) found
reduced expression of both BCCIP-alpha and -beta in kidney tumors.

GENE STRUCTURE

Meng et al. (2003) determined that the BCCIP gene contains 9 exons and
spans about 30 kb. The 5-prime end of the BCCIP gene abuts the UROS gene
(606938) on the opposite strand in a head-to-head manner. BCCIP and UROS
share a functional intergenic bidirectional promoter that contains
binding sites for various transcription factors. The last 3 exons of
BCCIP overlap with seven 3-prime exons of the DHX32 gene (607960) on the
opposite strand.

MAPPING

By FISH and genomic sequence analysis, Liu et al. (2001) mapped the
BCCIP gene to chromosome 10q25.3-q26.2.

612944	TITLE *612944 RIBONUCLEASE T2; RNASET2
;;RNASE6PL
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

RNASET2 belongs to the RNase T2 family (EC 3.1.27.1) of proteins that
are present in all phyla and primarily function in the extracellular
milieu. In some microorganisms and plants, T2 RNases mediate phosphate
uptake by digesting extracellular RNAs. In other species, they provide
host protection against pathogens or trigger cellular senescence. Human
RNASET2 appears to suppress tumorigenicity (Monti et al., 2008).

CLONING

By searching for coding sequences in a region of chromosome 6 that is
frequently rearranged in malignancies, followed by screening a pooled
tissue cDNA library, Trubia et al. (1997) cloned RNASET2. The deduced
191-amino acid protein contains 2 highly conserved pentameric catalytic
motifs. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.2-kb transcript in all
tissues examined.

Using Northern blot analysis, Acquati et al. (2001) detected ubiquitous
expression of a 1.4-kb RNASET2 transcript. Highest expression was in
liver and heart, and lowest expression was in lung and placenta.

Campomenosi et al. (2006) stated that full-length human RNASET2 has 256
amino acids and shares 67.4% identity with mouse Rnaset2. Western blot
analysis detected RNASET2 in most ovarian cancer cell lines at an
apparent molecular mass of 31 kD. Proteins of 36 and 27 kD were also
detected in some cell lines, and the 36-kD protein was secreted into the
culture medium. Subcellular fractionation of transfected ovarian cancer
cells revealed full-length RNASET2 in the endoplasmic reticulum fraction
and the 2 smaller RNASET2 isoforms in the lysosome fraction.

Acquati et al. (2005) identified an N-terminal signal sequence and 3
putative N-glycosylation sites in full-length RNASET2.
Fluorescence-tagged RNASET2 localized to the Golgi apparatus of
transfected human embryonic kidney cells, and the 36-kD protein was
secreted into the culture medium. Western blot analysis detected 4
RNASET2 species between 31 and 36 kD. Endoglycosylase treatment of in
vitro-translated RNASET2 resulted in disappearance of the higher
molecular mass forms and accumulation of the 31-kD protein. Acquati et
al. (2005) concluded that RNASET2 is a secreted glycoprotein.

By RT-PCR analysis, Henneke et al. (2009) found strong RNASET2
expression in temporal lobe and fetal brain, followed by capsula
interna, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and corpus callosum, and low
expression in amygdala.

GENE FUNCTION

Abnormalities of chromosome 6q are associated with several solid
neoplasms, including carcinomas of the ovary (167000). Using PCR,
Acquati et al. (2001) found that expression of RNASET2 was reduced in
30% of 55 primary ovarian tumors with alterations at 6q26-qter.
Downregulation of RNASET2 was also detected in 75% of ovarian tumor cell
lines. Transfection of RNASET2 into HEY4 and SG10G ovarian tumor cell
lines suppressed their tumorigenicity following injection into nude
mice. RNASET2 induced cell senescence in HEY4 cells when expressed over
a certain threshold, while suppression of tumorigenicity in mice
required only minimal RNASET2 expression.

Using zymogram gel electrophoresis, Campomenosi et al. (2006) showed
that recombinant RNASET2 had optimum catalytic activity at pH 5. PolyU
and polyA were efficiently cleaved, whereas polyG and polyC were
resistant to cleavage. Activity of RNASET2 did not depend on
glycosylation.

Acquati et al. (2005) introduced 2 mutations into RNASET2 (his65 to phe
and his118 to phe) that reduced its ribonuclease activity to less than
1% of wildtype. Using HEY4 cells and a highly metastatic HEY4 subclone,
they found that the mutations did not alter the ability of RNASET2 to
suppress metastasis following injection into nude mice.

Malignant melanoma (see 155600) is associated with chromosomal
rearrangements in the 6q27 region. Using real-time PCR, Monti et al.
(2008) found that RNASET2 expression was downregulated in 4 of 8
melanoma cell lines, including the SK-MEL28 cell line. Transfection of
SK-MEL28 cells with RNASET2 reduced their tumorigenicity upon injection
into nude mice, but it had no effect on their growth or clonogenicity in
culture.

GENE STRUCTURE

Acquati et al. (2001) determined that the RNASET2 gene contains 9 exons
and spans about 27 kb. The proximal promoter region shows greatest CpG
density close to the transcription start site.

MAPPING

By YAC analysis, Trubia et al. (1997) mapped the RNASET2 gene to
chromosome 6q27. Southern blot analysis showed that RNASET2 is a
single-copy gene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By linkage analysis followed by candidate gene sequencing in 2
consanguineous Turkish families with cystic leukoencephalopathy without
megalencephaly (612951), Henneke et al. (2009) identified 2 different
homozygous mutations in the RNASET2 gene (612944.0001 and 612944.0002,
respectively) that segregated with the disorder. Analysis of 3
additional unrelated individuals with the disorder identified homozygous
or compound heterozygous RNASET2 mutations (612944.0003-612944.0006).
All of the mutations were predicted to result in loss of protein
function. The phenotype was characterized by normo- or microcephaly,
early onset of severe psychomotor retardation, cystic changes in the
anterior temporal lobes, and multifocal white matter lesions; the
phenotype was indistinguishable from neonatal asymptomatic
cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY, CYSTIC, WITHOUT MEGALENCEPHALY
RNASET2, CYS184ARG

In 2 sibs, born of Turkish consanguineous parents, with cystic
leukoencephalopathy without megalencephaly (612951), Henneke et al.
(2009) identified a homozygous 550T-C transition in exon 8 of the
RNASET2 gene, resulting in a cys184-to-arg (C184R) substitution in a
highly conserved disulfide bond, predicted to interfere with the native
protein conformation. Both unaffected parents were heterozygous for the
mutation. In vitro functional expression studies showed that the
C184R-mutant protein showed defective trafficking to the extracellular
medium, consistent with impaired protein folding or stability. The
patients had onset of neurologic impairment by age 3 months.

.0002
LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY, CYSTIC, WITHOUT MEGALENCEPHALY
RNASET2, 2.5-KB DEL

In 2 sibs, born of Turkish consanguineous parents, with cystic
leukoencephalopathy (612951), Henneke et al. (2009) identified a
homozygous 2.5-kb deletion including exon 3 and part of introns 1 and 2
of the RNASET2 gene. Both unaffected parents were heterozygous for the
mutation. The patients had onset of neurologic impairment by age 1
month.

.0003
LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY, CYSTIC, WITHOUT MEGALENCEPHALY
RNASET2, IVS5AS, A-G, -2

In a Turkish girl, born of consanguineous parents, with cystic
leukoencephalopathy (612951), Henneke et al. (2009) identified a
homozygous A-to-G transition in intron 5 of the RNASET2 gene, resulting
in a splice site mutation and altered transcripts with either deletion
of exons or frameshifts. Both unaffected parents were heterozygous for
the mutation. The patient had onset of neurologic impairment by age 12
months. At age 4 years, she could sit and walk without aid, showed
spasticity, and had developed comprehensible speech.

.0004
LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY, CYSTIC, WITHOUT MEGALENCEPHALY
RNASET2, 1-BP DEL, 332+1G

In a Spanish boy with cystic leukoencephalopathy (612951), Henneke et
al. (2009) identified a homozygous 1-bp deletion (332+1delG) in the
donor splice site of exon 5 of the RNASET2 gene, resulting in altered
transcripts with deleted exons. The patient had onset of neurologic
impairment by age 3 months. At age 2 years, he had no head control, no
use of his hands, seizures, and poor social contact.

.0005
LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY, CYSTIC, WITHOUT MEGALENCEPHALY
RNASET2, 15-BP DEL

In a girl of German and Turkish ancestry with cystic leukoencephalopathy
(612951), Henneke et al. (2009) identified compound heterozygosity for 2
mutations in the RNASET2 gene: a 15-bp deletion in exon 1, resulting in
an in-frame loss of 5 residues within the putative signal peptide, and a
567G-A transition at the last nucleotide of exon 8 (612944.0006) that
does not change residue gln189, but disrupts the splicing process,
leading to the skipping of exon 8. She had onset of neurologic
impairment by age 7 months. Age age 10, she had microcephaly, seizures,
and could sit alone, but needed aid to walk. She had no speech
development.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ABCA4 gene produces an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily
transmembrane protein expressed exclusively in retinal photoreceptors
that is involved in clearance from photoreceptor cells of
all-trans-retinal aldehyde (atRAL), a byproduct of the retinoid cycle of
vision (Sun et al., 1999; Cideciyan et al., 2009).

CLONING

Allikmets et al. (1997) identified the ABCR gene among expressed
sequence tags obtained from human retina. ABCR was found to be closely
related to the mouse and human ABC1 (600046) and ABC2 (600047) genes.
The ABCR gene was not expressed detectably in any of 50 nonretinal fetal
and adult tissues examined. Other studies indicated that the gene is
uniquely retina-specific. The transcript size was estimated to be 8 kb.
Allikmets et al. (1997) reported the complete sequence of the 6,705-bp
ABCR coding region and the predicted 2,235-amino acid polypeptide
encoded by it.

Allikmets et al. (1998) revised the estimate of the size of the ABCR
gene to 6,819 bp encoding a 2,273-amino acid protein.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Gerber et al. (1998) and Allikmets et al.
(1998) determined that the ABCA4 gene contains at least 50 exons and
spans an estimated 150 kb. Exon sizes range from 33 bp to 266 bp.

GENE FAMILY

The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily includes genes whose products
are transmembrane proteins involved in energy-dependent transport of a
wide spectrum of substrates across membranes. Allikmets et al. (1997)
noted that many disease-causing members of this superfamily result in
defects in the transport of specific substrates, e.g., CFTR (602421),
ALD (300100), SUR (600509), PMP70 (170995), and TAP2 (170261). In
eukaryotes, ABC genes typically encode 4 domains that include 2
conserved ATP-binding domains and 2 domains with multiple transmembrane
segments. The ATP-binding domains of the ABC genes contain motifs of
characteristic conserved residues (Walker A and B motifs) spaced by 90
to 120 amino acids. Both this conserved spacing and the 'signature' or
'C' motif just upstream of the Walker B site distinguish members of the
ABC superfamily from other ATP-binding proteins. These features allowed
the isolation of new ABC genes by hybridization, degenerate PCR, and
inspection of DNA sequence databases. Allikmets et al. (1996)
characterized 21 members of the ABC superfamily by determining their map
locations and patterns of expression.

MAPPING

Using a whole genome radiation hybrid panel, Allikmets et al. (1997)
mapped the ABCR gene to 1p21-p13, close to microsatellite markers D1S236
and D1S188. They further refined the localization by screening YACs from
the described contig between these anonymous markers. These YACs
delineated a region containing the Stargardt disease gene.

Azarian and Travis (1997) mapped the human photoreceptor rim protein
gene (RMP) to chromosome 1 by radiation hybrid analysis. By homology,
they mapped the mouse Rmp gene to chromosome 3 between the Ly37 and Tshb
loci. Nasonkin et al. (1998) refined the map position of the human ABCR
gene to 1p22.1-p21 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. By contig
mapping, Allikmets et al. (1998) localized the ABCR gene to chromosome
1p22.3-p22.2 between markers D1S3361 and D1S236.

GENE FUNCTION

Allikmets et al. (1997) localized ABCR transcripts exclusively within
photoreceptor cells, indicating that ABCR mediates the transport of an
essential molecule (or ion) either into or out of photoreceptor cells.

The ABCR gene is expressed exclusively in the retina, and in situ
hybridization localized ABCR transcripts to rod photoreceptor cells. Sun
and Nathans (1997) further localized ABCR to the disc membrane of
retinal rod outer segments. The observations narrowed the range of
plausible functions for ABCR and the corresponding range of pathogenic
mechanisms underlying Stargardt disease (STGD; 248200). The authors
commented that the accumulation of lipofuscin in the retinal pigment
epithelium in Stargardt disease might reflect a defective ABCR-mediated
transport of retinoids within the rod outer segment.

Allikmets et al. (1997) commented that the accumulation in the retinal
pigment epithelium (RPE) of a lipofuscin-like substance in STGD suggests
that the site of ABCR-mediated transport may be on the apical face of
the photoreceptor cell and that this transport may affect exchange
between the RPE and the photoreceptors.

To search for natural and artificial substrates and/or allosteric
regulators of ABCR, Sun et al. (1999) solubilized and functionally
reconstituted the purified protein into lipid membranes and surveyed a
group of structurally diverse compounds for their ability to stimulate
or inhibit ABCR ATPase activity. They observed that all-trans-retinal
stimulated the ATPase activity of ABCR 3- to 4-fold. 11-cis- and
13-cis-retinal showed similar activity. All-trans-retinal stimulated the
ATPase activity of ABCR with Michaelis-Menten behavior indicative of
simple noncooperative binding associated with a rate-limiting
enzyme-substrate intermediate in the pathway of ATP hydrolysis. Sun et
al. (1999) concluded that these and other findings supported the
hypothesis that various geometric isomers of retinal and/or other
retinoids are transported by ABCR in a reaction that is coupled to ATP
hydrolysis. The kinetic behavior implied that all-trans-retinal binds to
an intermediate in the ATPase reaction pathway and that this binding
accelerates a rate-limiting step in ATP hydrolysis and/or release of the
hydrolysis products.

Korschen et al. (1999) identified glutamic acid-rich proteins (GARPs;
see 600724) as multivalent proteins that interact with the key players
of cGMP signaling, phosphodiesterase (see 602676) and guanylate cyclase
(see 600179), and with ABCR, through 4 short repetitive sequences. In
electron micrographs, GARPs are restricted to the rim region and
incisures of discs in close proximity to the guanylate cyclase and ABCR,
whereas the phosphodiesterase is randomly distributed. Korschen et al.
(1999) concluded that the GARPs organize a dynamic protein complex near
the disc rim that may control cGMP turnover and possibly other
light-dependent processes.

Molday et al. (2000) showed by immunofluorescence microscopy and Western
blot analysis that ABCR is present in foveal and peripheral cone, as
well as rod, photoreceptors. The results suggested that the loss in
central vision experienced by patients with Stargardt macular dystrophy
arises directly from ABCR-mediated foveal cone degeneration.

The aldehyde group of all-trans-retinal reacts with the primary amine of
phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to form an equilibrium mixture of
N-retinylidene-PE and all-trans-retinal. Beharry et al. (2004) isolated
Abca4 from bovine rod outer segment disc membranes, and using HPLC and
radiolabeled substrates, they found that Abca4 bound N-retinylidene-PE
and all-trans-retinal. ATP and GTP released these retinoids from Abca4,
but ADP, GDP, and nonhydrolyzable derivatives did not. N-retinyl-PE, the
reduced form of N-retinylidene-PE, also bound Abca4, and
all-trans-retinal bound Abca4 in the absence of PE. All-trans-retinol
did not bind Abca4. Beharry et al. (2004) concluded that ABCA4 functions
as a flippase to translocate N-retinylidene-PE from the lumen to the
cytoplasmic side of retinal disc membranes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Summaries of Mutations

Allikmets (2000) gave a tally of all ABCR alleles as 350 to 400, making
the heterogeneity of ABCR comparable to that of another member of the
ABC superfamily, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
(CFTR). Allelic variations in ABCR are the most prominent cause of
retinal dystrophies with mendelian inheritance patterns.

Sun et al. (2000) listed 37 reported naturally occurring ABCA4
mutations. By studying expression of ABCR variants in transiently
transfected 293 cells, they observed a wide spectrum of biochemical
defects in these variants and provided insight into the transport
mechanism of ABCR.

- Stargardt Macular Dystrophy

Allikmets et al. (1997) performed mutation analysis of the ABCR gene in
48 families with Stargardt macular dystrophy (STGD1; 248200) previously
ascertained by strict definitional criteria and shown to be linked to
1p. Using a total of 21 exons, they identified 19 different mutations
(see, e.g., 601691.0001-601691.0005), the majority representing missense
mutations in conserved amino acid positions. However, they also found
several 1- to 2-bp insertions and deletions representing frameshifts.
Two missense alterations (D847H; R943Q, 601691.0035) were found in at
least 1 control individual, suggesting that they are neutral
polymorphisms. The remaining mutations were found only in STGD patients
and not in at least 40 unrelated normal controls (80 chromosomes). The
mutations were scattered throughout the coding sequence of the ABCR
gene. Most of the patients were found to be compound heterozygotes but 2
consanguineous families (1 Saudi Arabian (601691.0002) and 1 North
American) were homozygous. In an erratum, Allikmets et al. (1997)
provided a correction of the numbering system for mutations in the ABCR
gene in Stargardt macular dystrophy. Sequencing of ABCR cDNA clones
revealed an additional 114-bp exon after position 4352. This exon adds
38 in-frame amino acids to the polypeptide and represents the major
transcript. See 601691.0004 and 601691.0005.

Nasonkin et al. (1998) reported 4 mutations in the ABCR gene in patients
with Stargardt disease: 3106G-A (601691.0011), 3211insGT (601691.0012),
2565G-A (601691.0013), and 6079C-T (601691.0004).

Lewis et al. (1999) reported results of mutation scanning and direct DNA
sequencing of all 50 exons of ABCR in 150 families segregating autosomal
recessive Stargardt disease (STGD1). ABCR variations were identified in
173 (57%) disease chromosomes, most of which represented missense amino
acid substitutions. These ABCR variants were not found in 220 unaffected
control individuals (440 chromosomes) but did cosegregate with the
disease in these families with STGD1, and many occurred in conserved
functional domains. Missense amino acid substitutions located in the
amino terminal one-third of the protein appeared to be associated with
earlier onset of the disease and may represent misfolding alleles. The 2
most common mutant alleles, gly1961 to glu (601691.0007) and ala1038 to
val (601691.0016), each identified in 16 of 173 disease chromosomes,
represented 18.5% of mutations identified. G1961E in heterozygous state
had previously been associated, at a statistically significant level,
with age-related macular degeneration (ARMD). Clinical evaluation of
these 150 families with STGD1 revealed a high frequency of ARMD in
first- and second-degree relatives. These findings supported the
hypothesis that compound heterozygous ABCR mutations are responsible for
STGD1 and that some ABCR mutations in heterozygous state may enhance
susceptibility to ARMD.

Rivera et al. (2000) studied 144 patients with Stargardt disease and 220
unaffected individuals ascertained from the German population, to
complete a comprehensive, population-specific survey of the sequence
variation in the ABCA4 gene. In addition, they studied 200 individuals
with ARMD to assess the possible role of ABCA4 in that disorder. Using a
screening strategy based primarily on denaturing gradient gel
electrophoresis, they identified a total of 127 unique alterations, of
which 90 had not previously been reported, and classified 72 as probable
pathogenic mutations. Of the 288 Stargardt disease chromosomes studied,
mutations were identified in 166, representing a detection rate of
approximately 58%. Eight different alleles accounted for 61% of the
identified disease alleles, and at least 1 of these, the L541P/A1038V
complex allele (601691.0023), appeared to be a founder mutation in the
German population. When the group with ARMD and the control group were
analyzed with the same methodology, 18 patients with ARMD and 12
controls were found to harbor possible disease-associated alterations.
This represented no significant difference between the 2 groups;
however, for detection of modest effects of rare alleles in complex
diseases, the analysis of larger cohorts of patients may be required.

Yatsenko et al. (2001) tested the hypothesis that patients with
late-onset Stargardt disease, i.e., onset at 35 years or later, retained
partial ABCR activity attributable to mild missense alleles. They
approached this study by in vivo functional analysis of various
combinations of mutant alleles. They directly sequenced the entire
coding region of ABCR and detected mutations in 33 of 50 (66%) disease
chromosomes, but surprisingly, 11 of 33 (33%) were truncating alleles.
Importantly, all 22 missense mutations were located outside the known
functional domains of ABCR (ATP-binding or transmembrane), whereas in
the general cohort of STGD1 subjects studied by Lewis et al. (1999),
alterations occurred with equal frequency across the entire protein.
Yatsenko et al. (2001) suggested that these missense mutations in
regions of unknown function are milder alleles and are more susceptible
to modifier effects. Thus, they corroborated a prediction from the model
of ABCR pathogenicity that (1) one mutant ABCR allele is always missense
in late-onset STGD1 patients, and (2) the age of onset is correlated
with the amount of ABCR activity of this allele. In addition, they
reported 3 new pseudodominant families, bringing the total to 8 of 178
outbred STGD1 families, and suggested a carrier frequency of
STGD1-associated ABCR mutations of about 4.5% (approximately 1 in 22).

Using double gradient-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DG-DGGE),
Fumagalli et al. (2001) performed a mutation screen in 44 Italian
autosomal recessive Stargardt disease patients corresponding to 36
independent genomes. In 34 of the 36 patients (94.4%), 37 sequence
changes were identified, including 26 missense, 6 frameshift, 3
splicing, and 2 nonsense variations. Twenty of the 37 mutations had not
previously been described. There appeared to exist a subset of molecular
defects specific to the Italian population. The identification of at
least 2 disease-associated mutations in 4 healthy control individuals
indicated a higher than expected carrier frequency of variant ABCR
alleles in the general population. Genotype-phenotype analysis showed a
possible correlation between the nature and location of some mutations
and specific ophthalmoscopic features of STGD disease.

Fingert et al. (2006) reported a case of Stargardt disease in a patient
homozygous for a mutation in the ABCA4 gene (601691.0026) as a result of
uniparental isodisomy of chromosome 1. The patient's father was
heterozygous for the mutation.

Pal Singh et al. (2006) identified homozygous null mutations in the
ABCA4 gene (601691.0028-601691.0029) in affected members of 2 Indian
families with early-onset severe retinal dystrophy.

- Age-Related Macular Degeneration

Age-related macular degeneration (ARMD; see 153800) is the leading cause
of severe central visual impairment among the elderly and is associated
both with environmental factors such as smoking and with genetic
factors. Allikmets et al. (1997) screened 167 unrelated ARMD patients
for alterations in the ABCR gene. Thirteen different ARMD-associated
alterations, both deletions and amino acid substitutions (e.g.,
601691.0006), were found in 1 allele of ABCR in 26 patients (16%). The
authors suggested that identification of ABCR alterations will permit
presymptomatic testing for high-risk individuals and may lead to earlier
diagnosis of ARMD and to new strategies for prevention and therapy.

De La Paz et al. (1999) screened their patients with ARMD (159 familial
cases from 112 multiple families and 53 sporadic cases) and 56 racially
matched individuals with no known history of ARMD for evidence of
mutation in the ABCR gene. The authors identified only 2 of the
previously reported variants in their study population. Both variants
occurred in sporadic cases, and none was found in familial cases or in
the randomly selected population. In addition, the authors identified
several previously undescribed polymorphisms and variants in both the
ARMD and control populations. The authors concluded that mutation in the
ABCR gene is not a major genetic risk factor for ARMD in their study
population.

Shroyer et al. (1999) analyzed the ABCA4 gene in a 3-generation family
manifesting both Stargardt disease and ARMD, and identified
heterozygosity for a missense mutation (P1380L; 601691.0026) in the
paternal grandmother with ARMD, whereas the proband and his 2 paternal
cousins with Stargardt disease were compound heterozygous for the P1380L
mutation and another missense mutation (601691.0036 and 601691.0037,
respectively) in the ABCA4 gene. Shroyer et al. (1999) suggested that
carrier relatives of STGD patients may have an increased risk of
developing ARMD.

Allikmets and the International ABCR Screening Consortium (2000) tested
the original hypothesis that ABCR is a dominant susceptibility locus for
ARMD by screening 1,218 unrelated ARMD patients of North American and
western European origin and 1,258 comparison individuals from 15 centers
in North America and Europe for the 2 most frequent ARMD-associated
variants found in ABCR: G1961E (601691.0007) and D2177N (601691.0006).
One or the other of these sequence changes was found in 1 allele of ABCR
in 40 patients (3.4%) and in 13 control subjects (0.95%). These
differences were considered statistically significant. The risk of ARMD
was elevated approximately 3-fold in D2177N carriers and approximately
5-fold in G1961E carriers.

By mutation analysis in a cohort of families that manifested both STGD
and ARMD, Shroyer et al. (2001) found that ARMD-affected relatives of
STGD patients are more likely to be carriers of pathogenic STGD alleles
than predicted based on chance alone. Shroyer et al. (2001) used an in
vitro biochemical assay to test for protein expression and ATP-binding
defects, and found that mutations associated with ARMD have a range of
assayable defects ranging from no detectable defect to apparent null
alleles. Of the 21 missense ABCR mutations reported in patients with
ARMD, 16 (76%) showed abnormalities in protein expression, ATP binding,
or ATPase activity. They inferred that carrier relatives of STGD
patients are predisposed to develop ARMD.

Guymer et al. (2001) investigated the role of the G1961E (601691.0007)
and D2177N (601691.0006) alleles of the ABCA4 gene in the pathogenesis
of ARMD. They concluded that although the ABCA4 gene is definitively
involved in the pathogenesis of Stargardt disease and some cases of
photoreceptor degeneration, the alleles did not appear to be involved in
a statistically significant fraction of ARMD cases.

Single-copy variants of the ABCR gene have been shown to confer enhanced
susceptibility to ARMD. Bernstein et al. (2002) examined 19 of 33 sibs
from 15 Stargardt families who carried their respective proband's
variant ABCR allele. Some families exhibited concordance of ABCR alleles
with the macular degeneration phenotype, but others did not. Exudative
ARMD was uncommon among both probands and sibs.

- Retinitis Pigmentosa 19

Martinez-Mir et al. (1998) demonstrated that the causative mutation in a
family with retinitis pigmentosa-19 (601718) was a frameshift
(601691.0008) in the ABCR gene, which was present in homozygous state.
The authors observed that the heterozygous parents, aged 72 and 82, in
their family showed no signs of age-related macular dystrophy (ARMD).
They thought, however, that this finding did not argue against
haploinsufficiency of ABCR as the cause of ARMD; because this is a
multifactorial disorder, ABCR haploinsufficiency may be only a
predisposing factor, and not all parents of patients have ARMD. ABCR
expression is confined to rods, and the fact that these photoreceptors
are the cell type primarily affected in RP support ABCR as the gene
responsible for RP19. They pointed out that the highest concentration of
rods is 5 mm out from the fovea, within the zone that is affected in
macular degeneration. If the rods in Stargardt disease and age-related
macular degeneration produce an aberrant product, it would be expected
to reach its highest concentration in this region. Persons with 1
wildtype and 1 mutant ABCR allele would be predisposed to a late-onset
accumulation of cellular debris (drusen) and the development of ARMD.

- Cone-Rod Dystrophy 3

To evaluate the importance of the ABCA4 gene as a cause of autosomal
recessive cone-rod dystrophy (CORD3; 604116), Maugeri et al. (2000)
studied 5 patients with autosomal recessive CORD and 15 patients with
isolated CORD, all from Germany and the Netherlands. They found 19 ABCA4
mutations in 13 (65%) of 20 patients. In 6 patients, mutations were
identified in both ABCA4 alleles; in 7 patients, mutations were detected
in 1 allele. The complex ABCA4 allele L541P/A1038V (601691.0023) was
found exclusively in German patients with CORD; 1 patient carried this
complex allele in homozygous state, and 5 others were compound
heterozygous.

Following the studies of Maugeri et al. (2000), Ducroq et al. (2002)
evaluated the prevalence of ABCA4 mutations in a cohort of 55 patients
with autosomal recessive or sporadic cone-rod dystrophy. They screened
the 50 exons of the ABCA4 gene as well as the flanking intronic
sequences using DHPLC and identified 16 different mutant alleles in 13
(23.6%) of 55 patients. Among these 13 patients, 2 were homozygotes
(from 2 consanguineous families; see, e.g., 601691.0024), 4 were
compound heterozygotes, and 7 were simple heterozygotes. There was no
significant difference in the frequency of ABCA4 mutations between
autosomal recessive and sporadic cases of CORD (6 of 29 versus 7 of 26
cases, respectively). Ducroq et al. (2002) estimated that this screen
detected approximately 80% of mutations present in these families, with
unidentified mutations potentially located in promoter or intron
sequences or in undiscovered exons, and stated that the corrected
mutation frequency would then be 29.5% of all CORD cases. For a sporadic
case of cone-rod dystrophy with no ABCA4 mutation, they estimated that
the risk of the disease being inherited as an autosomal recessive
condition can be estimated to be 15.6% using the Bayesian calculation.

Fishman et al. (2003) examined 30 patients with autosomal recessive
CORD, 16 of whom harbored plausible disease-causing variations in the
ABCA4 gene. Among the mutation-positive patients, 2 distinctly different
fundus phenotypes were observed: 12 showed diffuse pigmentary
degenerative changes (type 1), whereas 4 showed either no pigmentary
changes or only a mild degree of peripheral pigment degeneration (type
2). All 16 patients showed either a central scotoma (6 patients) or both
a central scotoma and some degree of peripheral field loss (10
patients). Both cone and rod a- and b-wave electroretinogram (ERG)
amplitudes were reduced in all patients, which is diagnostic for CORD.
Of the 12 patients classified as type 1, 4 harbored an A1038V change
(601691.0016): in 2 this was the only sequence variation identified; in
1 case, it was observed in compound heterozygosity with a nonsense
mutation; and in 1 case it was found as a complex allele with an L541P
mutation (see 601691.0023). In the additional 8 patients classified as
type 1, 2 showed 2 different heterozygous missense mutations, 3 had a
single heterozygous missense mutation, and 3 had a heterozygous splice
site mutation within intron 40 (601691.0010). In the 4 patients with
considerably less funduscopically apparent pigmentary change (type 2), a
heterozygous missense mutation was observed: in 2 instances L1201R
(601691.0025), and in another 2 L2027F (601691.0004).

Ducroq et al. (2006) analyzed a large multiplex Christian Arab family
with presumed autosomal recessive CORD and 6 consanguineous loops and
found segregation of 3 distinct haplotypes at the CORD3 locus.
Sequencing of the ABCA4 gene revealed 3 different mutations segregating
with the disease in this family: 4 patients were homozygous for a
splice-site mutation; 4 were compound heterozygous for the splice-site
mutation and 1 of 2 missense mutations, respectively; and 1 patient was
compound heterozygous for the 2 missense mutations. Ducroq et al. (2006)
emphasized the pitfalls of homozygosity mapping in highly inbred
families when the heterozygote carrier frequency is high in the general
population.

Kitiratschky et al. (2008) screened the ABCA4 gene in 64 patients with
cone or cone-rod dystrophy and a family history consistent with
autosomal recessive inheritance. They identified mutations in 20 (31%)
of 64 patients, including 16 with CORD and 3 with cone dystrophy (see,
e.g., 601690.0007, 601690.0010, and 601691.0030-601691.0033).

ABCA4 gene and susceptibility to nonsyndromic cleft lip/palate, see
119530.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Stargardt disease and late-onset fundus flavimaculatus (FFM) are
autosomal recessive disorders leading to macular degeneration in
childhood and adulthood, respectively. Rozet et al. (1998) screened the
entire coding sequence of the ABCR gene in 40 unrelated STGD and 15 FFM
families and showed that mutations truncating the ABCR protein
consistently led to STGD. On the other hand, all mutations identified in
FFM were missense mutations affecting uncharged amino acids. They stated
that this was the first genotype/phenotype correlation in ABCR gene
mutations.

Shroyer et al. (1999) reviewed ABCR mutations and the associated retinal
diseases and proposed a model in which ABCR activity inversely
correlates with severity of disease. In this model, truncating and
severely misfolding mutations are associated with early-onset disease
characterized by a primary photoreceptor loss and secondary retinal
pigment epithelium (RPE) defects (retinitis pigmentosa and cone-rod
dystrophy). In patients with milder mutations, photoreceptors are spared
initially, but byproducts of faulty ABCR transport lead to accumulated
material in the RPE and sequential photoreceptor loss (Stargardt disease
and fundus flavimaculatus). Similarly, ABCR-associated ARMD might be due
to the gradual accumulation of these same byproducts with eventual
photoreceptor loss.

Klevering et al. (2004) described 3 Dutch families in which different
combinations of retinal disorders occurred: ARMD, RP, and STGD in the
first family, RP and STGD in the second family, and ARMD, CORD, and STGD
in the third family. Three different mutations in the ABCA4 gene were
identified in these families. In view of the relatively high carrier
frequency of ABCA4 mutations (approximately 5%) in the general
population, Klevering et al. (2004) concluded that the occurrence of
various combinations of relatively rare retinal disorders in one family
might not be as uncommon as once believed.

Wiszniewski et al. (2005) analyzed missense mutations (see, e.g.,
601691.0023) in the photoreceptors of transgenic Xenopus laevis tadpoles
and found mislocalization of ABCA4 protein. These mutations caused
retention of ABCA4 in the photoreceptor inner segment, likely by
impairing correct folding, resulting in the total absence of physiologic
protein function. Patients with different retinal dystrophies harboring
2 misfolding alleles exhibit early age of onset (5 to 12 years) of
retinal disease. Wiszniewski et al. (2005) suggested that a class of
ABCA4 mutants may be an important determinant of the age of onset of
retinal disease.

Valverde et al. (2007) screened for mutations in the ABCA4 gene in 60
patients in 50 Spanish families with different retinal dystrophies: 16
with autosomal recessive CORD, 27 with autosomal recessive retinitis
pigmentosa, and 7 with autosomal dominant macular degeneration. Sixteen
distinct variants were identified in 25 of the families. Thirteen of the
CORD families had mutations in the ABCA4 gene; the most prevalent
mutation in these families was a 2888delG mutation (601691.0027),
accounting for 30% of the alleles detected. Putative disease-associated
alleles were identified in 9 of the RP families and in 3 of the macular
degeneration families.

In 66 individuals with known disease-causing ABCA4 alleles, Cideciyan et
al. (2009) defined retina-wide disease expression by measuring rod and
cone photoreceptor-mediated vision. Serial measurements over a mean
period of 8.7 years were consistent with a model wherein a normal
plateau phase of variable length was followed by initiation of
retina-wide disease that progressed exponentially. Estimates of the age
of disease initiation were used as a severity metric and contributions
made by each ABCA4 allele were predicted. One-third of the nontruncating
alleles were found to cause more severe disease than premature
terminations, supporting the existence of a pathogenic component beyond
simple loss of function.

ANIMAL MODEL

By SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis of purified bovine and frog rod
outer segments, Azarian and Travis (1997) identified 210- and 240-kD
proteins, respectively, as RMP. By peptide microsequence analysis and
degenerate primers for nested PCR on bovine and mouse retinal libraries,
Azarian and Travis (1997) isolated a mouse Rmp cDNA encoding a putative
2,310-amino acid protein. Sequence analysis predicted 86% identity and
92% similarity of mouse RMP to human ABCR protein, 3 potential
N-glycosylation sites, 12 membrane-spanning segments, 2 ABC transporter
signature motifs with potential phosphorylation sites, and 2 consensus
ATP/GTP nucleotide-binding sites. Northern blot analysis revealed
expression exclusively in retina. Immunoblot analysis showed that RMP is
expressed predominantly in the outer segments of retinal photoreceptors.

Weng et al. (1999) characterized the ocular phenotype in Abcr knockout
mice. Mice lacking the Abcr gene showed delayed dark adaptation,
increased all-trans-retinaldehyde (all-trans-RAL) following light
exposure, elevated phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in outer segments,
accumulation of the protonated Schiff base complex of all-trans-RAL and
PE (N-retinylidene-PE), and striking deposition of a major lipofuscin
fluorophore (A2E) in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). These data
suggested that ABCR functions as an outwardly directed flippase for
N-retinylidene-PE. Delayed dark adaptation is likely due to accumulation
in discs of the noncovalent complex between opsin and all-trans-RAL.
ABCR-mediated retinal degeneration in patients may result from
'poisoning' of the RPE due to A2E accumulation, with secondary
photoreceptor degeneration due to loss of the ABCR support role.

The primary pathologic defect in Stargardt disease is accumulation of
toxic lipofuscin pigments, such A2E, in cells of the RPE. This
accumulation was thought to be responsible for the photoreceptor death
and severe visual loss in patients with Stargardt disease. Sieving et
al. (2001) found that treatment of rodents with isotretinoin (Accutane),
an agent used in the treatment of acne, delayed rhodopsin regeneration
and slowed recovery of rod sensitivity after light exposure.
Importantly, isotretinoin did not cause photoreceptor degeneration and
actually protected photoreceptors from light-induced damage. Light
activation of rhodopsin results in its release of
all-trans-retinaldehyde, which constitutes the first reactant in A2E
biosynthesis. A side effect of treatment with isotretinoin is reduced
night vision because of its inhibitory effect on 11-cis-retinol
dehydrogenase (601617) in RPE cells. Radu et al. (2003) tested the
effects of isotretinoin on lipofuscin accumulation in Abcr knockout
mice, a model of recessive Stargardt disease. They observed by electron
microscopy that isotretinoin blocked the formation of A2E biochemically
and the accumulation of lipofuscin pigments. No significant visual loss
was observed in Abcr-null mice by electroretinography. Isotretinoin also
blocked the slower, age-dependent accumulation of lipofuscin in wildtype
mice. The results suggested that treatment with isotretinoin may inhibit
lipofuscin accumulation and delay the onset of visual loss in patients
with Stargardt disease and may be an effective treatment for other forms
of retinal or macular degeneration associated with lipofuscin
accumulation.

CONE-ROD DYSTROPHY 3, INCLUDED
ABCA4, GLY863ALA

In affected members of 3 families with Stargardt macular dystrophy
(248200), Allikmets et al. (1997) found a 2588G-C transversion of the
ABCA4 gene, predicting a gly863-to-ala (G863A) amino acid substitution.

In 40 western European patients with STGD, Maugeri et al. (1999) found
19 novel mutations in the ABCR gene. The 2588G-C transversion,
identified in 15 (37.5%) patients, showed linkage disequilibrium with a
rare 2828G-A polymorphism (R943Q; 601091.0035) in exon 19, suggesting a
founder effect. The guanine at position 2588 is part of the 3-prime
splice site of exon 17. Analysis of the lymphoblastoid cell mRNA of 2
STGD patients with the 2588G-C mutation showed that the resulting mutant
ABCR proteins either lack gly863 or contain the missense mutation gly863
to ala. Maugeri et al. (1999) hypothesized that the 2588G-C alteration
is a mild mutation that causes STGD only in combination with a severe
ABCR mutation. This was supported by the fact that the accompanying ABCR
mutation in at least 5 of the 8 STGD patients was null (severe) and that
a combination of 2 mild mutations had not been observed among 68 STGD
patients. The 2588G-C mutation is present in 1 of every 35 western
Europeans, a rate higher than that of the most frequent severe autosomal
recessive mutation, delta-F508, in the CFTR gene in cystic fibrosis
(602421.0001). Given an STGD incidence of 1 in 10,000, homozygosity for
the 2588G-C mutation or compound heterozygosity for this and other mild
ABCR mutations probably does not result in an STGD phenotype.

Maugeri et al. (2002) studied 2,343 unrelated random control individuals
from 11 European countries and 241 control individuals from the U.S. and
found a carrier frequency of the 2588G-C mutation of 1 out of 54 and 1
out of 121, respectively. In Europe, an increasing gradient was observed
from southwest (carrier frequency in Portugal: 0 out of 199) to
northeast (carrier frequency in Sweden: 1 out of 18). Haplotype analysis
in 16 families with STGD (12 Dutch, 3 German, and 1 of Swedish origin)
segregating the 2588G-C mutation showed 4 intragenic SNPs invariably
present in all disease chromosomes and sharing of the same allele for
several microsatellite markers flanking the ABCA4 locus in most of the
disease chromosomes. These results indicated a single origin of the
2588G-C mutation, which was estimated to have occurred between 2,400 and
3,000 years ago. This study confirmed the 2588G-C mutation as one of the
most frequent autosomal recessive disease mutations in the European
population, with an origin somewhere in the north-northeastern parts of
Europe. Maugeri et al. (2002) raised the possibility of a carrier
advantage due to some unknown function of ABCA4 in nonocular tissues.
The high carrier frequency of the 2588C allele in Sweden of 1 out of 18
was in striking contrast with the incidence of STGD, which apparently is
not higher in that country than in the rest of Europe, and therefore
supported the hypothesis that this mutation represents a mild allele
which is not disease causing in homozygous state.

By enzyme-kinetic studies of mutations in the nucleotide-binding
domain-1 (NBD1) of the ABCA4 gene, Suarez et al. (2002) showed that the
G863Q mutation had a significant attenuation of the rate of nucleotide
hydrolysis and nucleotide binding affinity compared to wildtype protein
and the mild R943Q mutation.

Aberrant or modified splicing patterns of genes are causative for many
human diseases. Hiller et al. (2004) described widespread occurrence of
alternative splicing at NAGNAG acceptors. Hiller et al. (2006) reported
a genomewide screen for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that
affect such tandem acceptors. From 121 SNPs identified, they extracted
64 SNPs that most likely affect alternative NAGNAG splicing. They
demonstrated that the NAGNAG motif is necessary and sufficient for this
type of alternative splicing. Since 28% of the NAGNAG SNPs occurred in
known disease genes, they represented preferred candidates for
functional analysis. As an example of the disease relevance of a NAGNAG
SNP, they cited the ABCA4 gene and the mutation described by Maugeri et
al. (1999): a NAGNAG mutation (2588G/C, changing the acceptor site
TAGGAG to TAGCAG) that has a high frequency in patients with STGD1. By
experimental analysis of the splice patterns of 2 patients with STGD who
carried the mutation and 1 control individual, they found that only the
alleles with the TAGCAG produce 2 splice forms. The study of Hiller et
al. (2006) would predict exactly this outcome of the mutation.

In an 18.5-year-old female with cone dystrophy (CORD3; 604116), in whom
information on rod function was unavailable, Kitiratschky et al. (2008)
identified compound heterozygosity for the G863A mutation and a splice
site mutation (601690.0030). The patient, who had onset of disease at 18
years of age, had increased glare sensitivity and normal night vision,
atrophy of RPE at the macula, central scotoma, and decreased cone
response on electroretinography (ERG); information was unavailable on
her color vision or on ERG rod function. Family members were not
available for study.

In 3 families, Allikmets et al. (1997) found that individuals with
Stargardt macular dystrophy (248200) had a C-to-T transition at
nucleotide 5965 of the ABCR gene, predicting a leu1989-to-phe (L1989F)
amino acid substitution. In a correction of the numbering system for
mutations, necessitated by the finding of an additional 114-bp exon
after nucleotide position 4352, Allikmets et al. (1997) indicated that
the mutation originally designated LEU1989PHE should be L2027F. In 2
sibs with Stargardt disease, Nasonkin et al. (1998) identified a 6079C-T
transition, resulting in a leucine-to-phenylalanine change at codon 2027
(L2027F).

Fishman et al. (2003) observed this mutation in 2 patients with cone-rod
dystrophy (604116) who had comparatively mild funduscopically apparent
pigmentary changes.

In 2 families with Stargardt disease (248200), Allikmets et al. (1997)

predicted to result in a val2012-to-leu (V2012L) amino acid substitution
in the protein product. In a correction to the numbering system,
Allikmets et al. (1997) indicated that this mutation, originally

of 167 patients with age-related macular dystrophy (153800) and in only
1 of 220 controls. The associated retinal pathology ranged from fine
macular cuticular drusen (age 62 years) to normal maculas but extensive
extramacular and peripheral drusen (ages 72 and 74 years, respectively),
to geographic atrophy involving the central third of the macula in each
eye (ages 61 to 86 years, respectively).

ABCA4, GLY1961GLU

In 6 of 167 patients with age-related macular dystrophy (ARMD2; 153800),
Allikmets et al. (1997) found a gly1961-to-glu (G1961E) alteration in
the ABCR protein. The associated pathology ranged from a few tiny
juxtafoveal drusen in 1 eye of a patient (age 74 years), to confluent
drusen and drusenoid retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) detachments (age
78 years), to various forms of soft to calcified macular drusen and
extensive geographic atrophy (more than 1 disc diameter) (ages 81 and 82
years, respectively).

In a study of 150 families with recessive Stargardt disease (248200),
Lewis et al. (1999) found that the G1961E mutation was present in 16 of
173 chromosomes in which mutation was identified. G1961E in heterozygous
state had previously been associated with age-related macular
degeneration. In 150 families with STGD1, a high frequency of ARMD in
first- and second-degree relatives was found, suggesting that
heterozygosity enhances susceptibility to ARMD.

In a 14-year-old female with cone dystrophy (CORD3; 604116),
Kitiratschky et al. (2008) identified compound heterozygosity for a
5882G-A transition in exon 42 of the ABCA4 gene, resulting in the G1961E
substitution, and a splice site mutation (601691.0030). The patient, who
had onset of disease at 6 years of age, had a red-green defect of color
vision, normal glare sensitivity and night vision, RPE atrophy of the
macula and peripheral retina, central scotoma, and a reduced cone but
normal rod electroretinogram (ERG). Both mutations were also identified
in her affected brother, and their unaffected parents were each
heterozygous for 1 of the mutations, respectively.

Martinez-Mir et al. (1997) demonstrated that one form of autosomal
recessive retinitis pigmentosa (601718) maps to 1p21-p13, the same
region as that to which Stargardt disease and its somewhat milder
variant, fundus flavimaculatus, map. In a family with RP19, Martinez-Mir
et al. (1998) demonstrated a homozygous mutation in the ABCR gene, a
1-bp deletion at cDNA position 1847 (1847delA). The mutation generated a
frameshift early in the coding region (codon 616 in exon 13) that added
32 new residues and a premature stop codon.

ABCA4, IVS30, G-T, +1

Ophthalmologic and molecular genetic studies were performed by Cremers
et al. (1998) in a consanguineous family with individuals showing either
retinitis pigmentosa (601718) or cone-rod dystrophy (CORD3; 604116).
Assuming pseudodominant (recessive) inheritance of allelic defects,
linkage analysis positioned the causal gene at 1p21-p13 (lod score =
4.22), a genomic segment that harbors the ABCA4 gene involved in
Stargardt disease and age-related macular degeneration. In 4 RP patients
in this family they found homozygosity for a 5-prime splice site
mutation, IVS30+1G-T. The 5 patients with CORD in this family were
compound heterozygotes for the IVS30+1G-T mutation and a 5-prime splice
site mutation in intron 40: IVS40+5G-A (601691.0010). Both splice site
mutations were found heterozygously in 2 unrelated STGD patients (in
whom the second mutation was either a missense mutation or unknown), but
not in 100 control individuals. Since no Stargardt patient had been
reported to carry 2 ABCR null alleles and the RP phenotype was more
severe than the STGD phenotype, Cremers et al. (1998) hypothesized that
the intron 30 splice site mutation represented a true null allele. Since
the intron 30 mutation was found heterozygously in the CORD patients,
the intron 40 mutation probably rendered the exon 40 5-prime splice site
partially functional. These results showed that mutations in the ABCR
gene result not only in STGD and ARMD, but also in autosomal recessive
RP and CORD.

Cremers et al. (1998) presented evidence that a 5-prime splice site
mutation in intron 40 (IVS40+5G-A) in compound heterozygous state with
the IVS30+1G-T mutation (601691.0009) in the ABCR gene can result in
cone-rod dystrophy (CORD3; 604116).

In 3 patients with autosomal recessive CORD and diffuse pigmentary
degenerative changes, Fishman et al. (2003) identified the IVS40+5G-A
mutation.

In a 30-year-old man with cone dystrophy, Kitiratschky et al. (2008)
identified compound heterozygosity for the IVS40 5714+5G-A splice site
mutation and an L1940P substitution (601690.0033) in the ABCA4 gene. The
patient, who had onset of disease at 7 years of age, had normal color
vision, normal glare sensitivity and night vision, atrophy of the RPE
and choroid as well as RPE clumping in the area of the macula, central
scotoma, and a reduced cone but normal rod electroretinogram. Both
mutations were also identified in his affected sister, and their

Fishman et al. (2003) identified this mutation in 4 patients with

Shroyer et al. (2000) described a family showing pseudodominant

In 2 patients with cone-rod dystrophy (CORD3; 604116) with comparatively
mild funduscopically apparent pigmentary changes, Fishman et al. (2003)
identified a heterozygous leu1201-to-arg mutation (L1201R) in the ABCA4
gene.

ABCA4, PRO1380LEU

In a 3-generation family manifesting both Stargardt disease (SGTD1;
248200) and age-related macular degeneration (ARMD2; 153800), Shroyer et
al. (1999) identified heterozygosity for a 4139C-T transition in the
ABCA4 gene, resulting in a pro1380-to-leu (P1380L) substitution, in the
paternal grandmother with ARMD. The proband and his 2 paternal cousins,
who all had Stargardt disease, were compound heterozygous for the P1380L
mutation and a 2461T-A transversion in the ABCA4 gene, resulting in a
trp821-to-arg (W821R; 601691.0036) substitution, and a 3365G-A
transition in the ABCA4 gene, resulting in a glu1122-to-lys (E1122K;
601691.0037) substitution, respectively. Shroyer et al. (1999) suggested
that carrier relatives of STGD patients may have an increased risk of
developing ARMD.

In a female patient with Stargardt disease, Fingert et al. (2006)
identified homozygosity for a pro1380-to-leu mutation in the ABCA4 gene
caused by uniparental isodisomy of chromosome 1. Her father was
heterozygous for the mutation and the mother was not a carrier.

.0027
CONE-ROD DYSTROPHY 3
ABCA4, 1-BP DEL, 2888G

Valverde et al. (2007) identified a 1-bp deletion (2888delG) in the
ABCA4 gene in compound heterozygous or homozygous state in 4 of 13
Spanish patients with cone-rod dystrophy-3 (604116). The mutation leads
to a frameshift that produces a stop codon.

.0028
RETINAL DYSTROPHY, EARLY-ONSET SEVERE
ABCA4, 1-BP DEL, 1225A

In a brother and sister, born of consanguineous Indian parents, with
early-onset severe retinal dystrophy (see 248200), Pal Singh et al.
(2006) identified homozygosity for a 1-bp deletion at nucleotide 1225
(1225delA) in exon 9 of the ABCA4 gene, resulting in a frameshift at
arg409. The parents and an unaffected sib were heterozygous for the
mutation, which was not found in 100 normal controls.

.0029
RETINAL DYSTROPHY, EARLY-ONSET SEVERE
ABCA4, ARG2030TER

In 3 brothers, born of consanguineous Indian parents, with early-onset
severe retinal dystrophy (see 248200), Pal Singh et al. (2006)
identified homozygosity for a 6088C-T transition in exon 44 of the ABCA4
gene, resulting in an arg2030-to-ter substitution. The parents and an
unaffected sib were heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found
in 100 normal controls.

CONE-ROD DYSTROPHY 3
ABCA4, IVS39, T-C, -10

In 6 patients with cone-rod dystrophy (CORD3; 604116), 1 with cone
dystrophy, and 1 with cone dystrophy but no information on rod function,
all of whom had a family history consistent with autosomal recessive
inheritance, Kitiratschky et al. (2008) identified compound
heterozygosity for a splice site mutation (5461-10T-C) in intron 39 and
another mutation in the ABCA4 gene (see, e.g., 601690.0001 and
601690.0007). In 2 of the CORD3 patients, a mutation on the second
allele was not detected; the authors noted that with the methods used,
genomic rearrangement mutations could not be excluded.

ABCA4, ALA1762ASP

In a 20-year-old woman with cone dystrophy (CORD3; 604116), Kitiratschky
et al. (2008) identified compound heterozygosity for a 5285C-A
transversion in exon 37 of the ABCA4 gene, resulting in an
ala1762-to-asp (A1762D) substitution, and a 15-bp deletion (3539del15;
601690.0032) in exon 24 of the ABCA4 gene. The patient, who had onset of
disease at 10 years of age, had a red-green defect of color vision,
normal glare sensitivity and night vision, RPE atrophy of the macula and
peripheral retina, central scotoma, and a reduced cone but normal rod
electroretinogram (ERG). Both mutations were also identified in her
affected sister, and their unaffected parents were each heterozygous for
1 of the mutations, respectively. The A1762D mutation had previously
been found (Stenirri et al., 2004) in compound heterozygosity with
another ABCA4 missense mutation in a patient with Stargardt disease
(248200).

In 2 unrelated Spanish patients, 1 with fundus flavimaculatus (see
248200) and 1 with early-onset Stargardt disease (248200), Paloma et al.
(2001) identified heterozygosity for a mutation in exon 41 of the ABCA4
gene, resulting in a leu1940-to-pro (L1940P) substitution. The second
disease allele remained unidentified for both patients.

In a 30-year-old man with cone dystrophy (CORD3; 604116), Kitiratschky
et al. (2008) identified compound heterozygosity for a splice site
mutation in intron 40 of the ABCA4 gene (601690.0010) and a 5819T-C
transition in exon 41, resulting in the L1940P substitution.

STARGARDT DISEASE 1
ABCA4, ARG943GLN

Allikmets et al. (1997) reported the 2828G-A transition in exon 19 of
the ABCA4 gene, resulting in an arg943-to-gln (R943Q) substitution as a
neutral polymorphism in STGD patients and controls. alterations in the
ABCR gene. Subsequently, the R943Q variant was associated with mild
forms of ARMD ( Allikmets et al., 1997). Maugeri et al. (1999) found
that the R943Q variant was in linkage disequilibrium with the G863A
mutation (601091.0001), suggesting a founder effect.

By enzyme-kinetic studies of mutations in the nucleotide-binding
domain-1 (NBD1) of the ABCA4 gene, Suarez et al. (2002) showed that the
R943Q mutation had a small but detectable reduction in nucleotidase
activity and nucleotide binding affinity compared to wildtype protein.

;;PMA-INDUCED PROTEIN 1;;
ATL-DERIVED PMA-RESPONSIVE GENE; APR;;
NOXA
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

To identify genes involved in leukemogenesis of adult T-cell leukemia
(ATL), Hijikata et al. (1990) constructed a cDNA library from an ATL
tumor cell line named IKD. By differential plaque hybridization using
P32-labeled cDNAs of poly(A+) RNA from IKD cells and a human
T-lymphotropic virus type I-infected T-cell line (C91/PL) as probes and
RNA blot analysis, Hijikata et al. (1990) obtained a cDNA clone of a
gene highly expressed in IKD cells. Expression of this gene was also
detected in fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells of several ATL
patients, but not in those of healthy donors. The cDNA is 1,897 base
pairs in length, with a short open reading frame encoding a polypeptide
of 54 amino acids. Exposure of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells,
a T-cell lymphoma cell line (Jurkat), and quiescent human embryonic lung
cells to phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) resulted in rapid,
transient expression of 2.0-kb mRNA of the gene. This induction was not
inhibited by cyclohexamide. Hijikata et al. (1990) named their gene APR
for 'ATL-derived PMA-responsive gene.' From these findings, Hijikata et
al. (1990) suggested APR as a member of the cellular
immediate-early-response genes.

The critical function of tumor suppressor p53 (191170) is the induction
of apoptosis in cells exposed to noxious stresses. Oda et al. (2000)
searched for target genes of IRF1 (147575), p53, or both that showed
increased transcription in response to DNA damage. They used an mRNA
differential display method to isolate cDNAs whose mRNA expression
profiles differed between the x-ray-irradiated wildtype and IRF1/p53
doubly deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). They identified a
gene that they called Noxa (for 'damage'). Oda et al. (2000) isolated
and characterized the mouse Noxa gene. The transcription initiation site
was determined to be 158 basepairs upstream from the initiator ATG, and
a potential p53 recognition sequence was located at -155 to -174 in the
promoter region. Its cDNA encodes a 103-amino acid protein with 2
mutually related 9-amino acid sequences characteristic to the BH3 motif
of the BCL2 family of proteins. Noxa mRNA was constitutively expressed
in small amounts in the brain, thymus, spleen, lung, kidney, and testis
of adult mice. Oda et al. (2000) screened for a human homolog of Noxa
cDNA and found that the cloned cDNA showing the highest degree of
similarity was identical to the APR gene. Human NOXA, or APR, encodes 54
amino acids, containing only 1 BH3 motif at amino acids 29 to 37. This
motif probably corresponds to the B motif of mouse Noxa, and the human
NOXA gene lacks the DNA segment corresponding to the second exon of
mouse Noxa. The promoter region of the human NOXA gene contains 1
p53-response element.

GENE FUNCTION

Oda et al. (2000) found that x-ray irradiation of wildtype MEFs
increased expression of Noxa mRNA about 5-fold, with kinetics similar to
those of the p53-dependent gene MDM2 (164785). In contrast, expression
of the Noxa gene was totally abolished in p53-deficient MEFs but not in
IRF1-deficient MEFs. When ectopically expressed, Noxa underwent BH3
motif-dependent localization to mitochondria and interacted with
antiapoptotic Bcl2 family members, resulting in the activation of
caspase-9 (602234). Human NOXA also induced apoptosis in various cells,
including Saos2 cells, in a BH3 motif-dependent manner. The introduction
of antisense oligonucleotide to NOXA inhibited p53-induced apoptosis.
Oda et al. (2000) concluded that Noxa may represent a novel mediator of
p53-dependent apoptosis.

Using a PCR-based subtractive hybridization approach, Kim et al. (2004)
found that Noxa was upregulated by hypoxia in cell lines from various
tissues in a p53-independent, Hif1a (603348)-dependent manner.
Upregulation of Noxa led to cell death by generating reactive oxygen
species (ROS) that induced cytochrome c release and caspase activation.
Induction of transient ischemia in a rat brain model, followed by TUNEL
analysis, revealed increased Noxa mRNA and protein expression and
apoptotic nuclei. The apoptosis could be reversed by liposomal delivery
of Noxa antisense oligonucleotides. Kim et al. (2004) concluded that
NOXA is an HIF1A-induced proapoptotic gene that mediates hypoxic cell
death by generation of ROS.

ANIMAL MODEL

Villunger et al. (2003) generated Noxa- and Puma- (605854) deficient
mice by targeted disruption. Null mice were born at the expected
frequency and became healthy adults. However, in both cases, there was
decreased DNA damage-induced apoptosis in fibroblasts, although only
loss of Puma protected lymphocytes from cell death. Puma deficiency also
protected cells against diverse p53-independent cytotoxic insults,
including cytokine deprivation and exposure to glucocorticoids, the
kinase inhibitor staurosporine, or phorbol ester. Villunger et al.
(2003) concluded that Puma and Noxa are critical mediators of the
apoptotic responses induced by p53 and other agents.

610101	TITLE *610101 CUTC COPPER TRANSPORTER, E. COLI, HOMOLOG OF; CUTC
;;COPPER TRANSPORTER PROTEIN CUTC
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the CUT family of copper transporters are associated with
copper homeostasis and are involved in the uptake, storage, delivery,
and efflux of copper (Gupta et al., 1995; Li et al., 2005).

CLONING

Using a PCR-based method, Li et al. (2005) cloned a member of the CUT
gene family, CUTC, from a human fetal brain cDNA library. CUTC encodes a
deduced 273-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of about 29.3 kD.
The CUTC protein shares 89% and 44% sequence identity with the mouse and
E. coli CutC proteins, respectively. RT-PCR analysis revealed expression
of CUTC in all human tissues examined, with lowest expression in
skeletal muscle, pancreas, prostate, and small intestine. Expression of
a CUTC-pEGF fusion plasmid in COS-7 and AD293 cells demonstrated the
presence of CUTC in the cytoplasm of both cell types and in the nucleus
of AD293 cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Based on the subcellular localization of the CUTC protein, Li et al.
(2005) suggested that CUTC may act as a shuttle protein in copper
homeostasis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Li et al. (2005) determined that the CUTC gene contains 9 exons and
spans over 23.6 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Li et al. (2005) mapped the CUTC gene to
chromosome 10q24.

612316	TITLE *612316 ATPase FAMILY, AAA DOMAIN-CONTAINING, MEMBER 3A; ATAD3A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ATAD3A and ATAD3B (612317) are mitochondrial membrane proteins that
contribute to the stabilization of large mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA)-protein complexes called nucleoids (He et al., 2007).

CLONING

Using mass spectroscopy to identify cell surface antigens on myeloid
cell lines, followed by RT-PCR of promyelocytic cell line RNA, Geuijen
et al. (2005) cloned ATAD3A. Western blot analysis detected ATAD3A at an
apparent molecular mass of 75 kD in transfected human embryonic kidney
(HEK293T) cells. Flow cytometry revealed ATAD3A on the cell surface of a
promyelocytic cell line, on 77% of AML (601626) samples, on half of
monocytes, and on a subpopulation of dendritic cells, but not on other
lymphocytes. ATAD3A was not expressed on the surface of transfected
HEK293T cells.

By searching for sequences similar to rat Atad3, He et al. (2007)
identified human ATAD3A and ATAD3B. In its C-terminal half, the deduced
587-amino acid ATAD3A protein contains Walker A and B motifs, followed
by ATP-binding sensor-1 and sensor-2 motifs. An alpha helix is located
N-terminal to the Walker A motif, and an arginine finger separates the
sensor motifs. An antibody that did not differentiate between ATAD3A and
ATAD3B detected ATAD3 in a punctate pattern within mitochondria of human
osteosarcoma cells. The pattern frequently coincided with
mtDNA-containing nucleoids, but not all nucleoids contained ATAD3.

Bogenhagen et al. (2008) stated that ATAD3A contains a central
transmembrane domain. Using immunofluorescence and protease
susceptibility studies, they found that ATAD3A was embedded in the inner
membrane of HeLa cell mitochondria, with the C-terminal AAA domain
directed toward the matrix and the N terminus exposed to the cytoplasm.

GENE FUNCTION

He et al. (2007) found that depletion of ATAD3 via small interfering RNA
in human osteosarcoma cells led to increased negative supercoiling of
mtDNA, although mitochondria maintained essentially normal morphology.

Bogenhagen et al. (2008) found that, although both ATAD3A and ATAD3B
were present in native HeLa cell nucleoids, neither ATAD3 protein was
crosslinked with mtDNA in isolated formaldehyde crosslinked HeLa cell
nucleoids, indicating that they are unlikely to bind mtDNA. In addition,
protease susceptibility studies suggested that the putative N-terminal
DNA-binding regions of ATAD3A and ATAD3B reside outside the
mitochondrial inner membrane.

MAPPING

Bogenhagen et al. (2008) stated that the ATAD3 locus is tandemly
duplicated in humans, generating 2 paralogs, ATAD3A and ATAD3B. The
ATAD3 genes are located on chromosome 1p36.33 (Schaffrik et al., 2006).

610777	TITLE *610777 NEUROGUIDIN; NGDN
;;NGD
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Neuroguidin is an EIF4E (133440)-binding protein that interacts with
CPEB (607342) and functions as a translational regulatory protein during
development of the vertebrate nervous system (Jung et al., 2006).

CLONING

Jung et al. (2006) cloned mouse Ngdn cDNA based on its homology with
Drosophila ngdn. The mouse and human protein sequences are 89%
identical. The 311-amino acid human NGDN protein has 3 conserved
N-terminal EIF4E-binding motifs. Northern blot analysis showed Ngdn
expression in mouse cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, kidney, spleen,
ovary, and testis. Western blot analysis detected Ngdn protein in all
mouse tissues except muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

By coimmunoprecipitation and cap column assays in mouse cerebellum
extracts, Jung et al. (2006) determined that Ngdn physically interacts
with EIF4E. Using Ngdn EIF4E-binding motif deletion mutants, they showed
that all 3 motifs contribute to binding and can compensate for one
another. In Xenopus oocytes, Ngdn coimmunoprecipitated with CPEB, and
Ngdn inhibited translation of cytoplasmic polyadenylation element
(CPE)-containing mRNAs in oocytes. Whole-mount in situ hybridization of
developing Xenopus embryos detected ngdn mRNA in the animal pole
blastomeres of the 4-cell embryo and in the neural crest and neural
folds of the neurula-stage embryo. Injection of antisense
morpholino-oligonucleotides against ngdn resulted in disrupted neural
tube closure and neural crest migration.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the NGDN
gene to chromosome 14 (TMAP SHGC-62927).

603427	TITLE *603427 PERIOD, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 3; PER3
DESCRIPTION The suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the anterior hypothalamus function
as a circadian clock in the mammalian brain, generating circadian
rhythms in physiology and behavior. The daily light-dark cycle acts
through retina-to-SCN neural pathways to entrain, or synchronize, the
SCN clock and its output rhythms to the 24-hour day. Shearman et al.
(1997) reported that PER3, a third mammalian homolog of the Drosophila
clock gene 'period' (per), is located within a human chromosome 1
genomic contig (GENBANK Z98884). The PAS (PER-ARNT-SIM) domain of PER3
shares 30%, 52%, and 51% identity with those of Drosophila per, PER1
(602260) and PER2 (603426), respectively. By searching an EST database,
Zylka et al. (1998) identified a cDNA encoding mouse Per3. They reported
that mouse Per3 RNA levels oscillate in the SCN and eyes. However,
unlike the RNA levels of Per1 and Per2 in the SCN, those of Per3 are not
acutely altered by light exposure at different times during subjective
night. Northern blot analysis indicated that Per3 is widely expressed in
tissues outside of brain. In liver, skeletal muscle, and testis, mouse
Per RNAs exhibited prominent synchronous circadian oscillations, leading
Zylka et al. (1998) to suggest that nonneuronal circadian oscillators
exist in mammals.

In zebrafish, Delaunay et al. (2000) found that expression of the clock
gene Per3 oscillates throughout embryogenesis in the central nervous
system and the retina. Per3 rhythmic expression was free-running and was
reset by light but not by the developmental delays caused by low
temperature. The time of fertilization had no effect on Per3 expression.
Per3 mRNA accumulated rhythmically in oocytes and persisted in embryos.
Delaunay et al. (2000) concluded that their results established that the
circadian clock functions during early embryogenesis in zebrafish.
Inheritance of maternal clock gene products suggests a mechanism of
phase inheritance through ovogenesis.

Toward a system-level understanding of the transcriptional circuitry
regulating circadian clocks, Ueda et al. (2005) identified
clock-controlled elements on 16 clock and clock-controlled genes in a
comprehensive surveillance of evolutionarily conserved cis elements and
measurement of the transcriptional dynamics. Ueda et al. (2005) found
that E boxes (CACGTG) and E-prime boxes (CACGTT) controlled the
expression of Per1 (602260), Nr1d2 (602304), Per2 (603426), Nr1d1
(602408), Dbp (124097), Bhlhb2 (604256), and Bhlhb3 (606200)
transcription following a repressor-precedes-activator pattern,
resulting in delayed transcriptional activity. RevErbA/ROR
(600825)-binding elements regulated the transcriptional activity of
Arntl (602550), Npas2 (603347), Nfil3 (605327), Clock (601851), Cry1
(601933), and Rorc (602943) through a repressor-precedes-activator
pattern as well. DBP/E4BP4-binding elements controlled the expression of
Per1, Per2, Per3, Nr1d1, Nr1d2, Rora (600825), and Rorb (601972) through
a repressor-antiphasic-to-activator mechanism, which generates
high-amplitude transcriptional activity. Ueda et al. (2005) suggested
that regulation of E/E-prime boxes is a topologic vulnerability in
mammalian circadian clocks, a concept that had been functionally
verified using in vitro phenotype assay systems.

ANIMAL MODEL

To assess the role of mouse Per3 in the circadian timing system,
Shearman et al. (2000) generated mice with a targeted disruption of the
Per3 gene and concluded that the gene is not necessary for circadian
rhythms in mice.

Bae et al. (2001) bred Per1/Per3 and Per2/Per3 double-mutant mice and
observed that behavioral rhythms of these mice resembled rhythms of mice
with disruption of Per1 or Per2 alone, respectively. They concluded that
Per3 does not play an important role in the circadian clock mechanism
regulating locomotor activity, and that the lack of robust phenotype in
Per3-deficient mice (Shearman et al., 2000) is not due to functional
redundancy among members of the Per gene family.

;;T2R42;;
T2R55
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TAS2R42 belongs to a family of intronless genes that encode highly
related bitter taste receptors (TAS2Rs). TAS2Rs are G protein-coupled
receptors, which are characterized by 7 transmembrane domains (summary
by Fischer et al., 2005). For further information on the TAS2R gene
family, see 604791.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Fischer et al. (2005) mapped the TAS2R42
gene, which they called T2R55, to a TAS2R gene cluster on chromosome
12p13.

;;MSPB
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

An abundant constituent of the human seminal plasma is a 14-kD protein
of prostate origin known as beta-microseminoprotein, prostatic secretory
protein (PRPS), or PSP94. It is a product of a single gene transcribed
in the prostate but not in the testis. The primary structure is known
from sequence determinations on the purified seminal plasma protein as
well as from the cDNA (Mbikay et al., 1987). The 94-amino acid seminal
protein is derived from a pre-polypeptide of 114 amino acids. There is a
possible N-glycosylation site on the amino-terminal leader peptide of
the pre-polypeptide molecule. From a comparison of the PSP(94) protein
in human and rhesus monkey, Nolet et al. (1991) found that the sequence
had evolved with few constraints and at a relatively rapid rate. Rapid
evolution of the gene might explain the apparent absence in nonprimates
of homologous sequences detectable by hybridization. The protein was
considered to be beta-inhibin because of reports of its ability to
suppress FSH secretion by the pituitary gland. Later the inhibin
activity of this seminal plasma protein was questioned when highly
purified preparations were found to be devoid of this activity.
Furthermore, it has no structural similarity to the ovarian inhibins.
Since the biologic functions of beta-microseminoprotein were unclear,
Ulvsback et al. (1989) studied expression of the gene. Transcripts of
identical size were found in prostate, respiratory (tracheal, bronchial,
and lung) tissues, and the mucosa of the gastric antrum. Thus, the
protein may have functions other than those related to male
reproduction.

MAPPING

Ulvsback et al. (1991) concluded that the gene is present in single copy
in the haploid human genome. By Southern analysis of DNA from somatic
cell hybrids, they assigned the gene to chromosome 10. The coding
nucleotides of the human MSMB gene are separated into 4 exons by
relatively large introns (Green et al., 1990). DNA hybridization under
conditions of low stringency suggested to Ulvsback et al. (1991) the
presence of a related gene in other mammals, birds, and amphibians.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization using a phage clone with an MSMB
insert, Sasaki et al. (1996) mapped the MSMB gene to 10q11.2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In large genomewide association studies to find common variants
influencing prostate cancer susceptibility, Thomas et al. (2008) and
Eeles et al. (2008) identified a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in
the proximal promoter of the MSMB gene (157145.0001) that was
significantly associated with prostate cancer risk.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PROSTATE CANCER, HEREDITARY, 13
MSMB, -2C-T (dbSNP rs10993994)

In a large 2-stage genomewide association study of prostate cancer,
Thomas et al. (2008) a single-nucleotide polymorphism, dbSNP rs10993994,
in the proximal promoter of the MSMB gene that was significantly
associated with prostate cancer risk (HPC13; 611928) (7.31 x 10(-13)).

Eeles et al. (2008) conducted a genomewide association study using blood
DNA samples from 1,854 individuals with clinically detected prostate
cancer diagnosed at or before the age of 60 years or with a family
history of disease, and 1,894 population-screened controls with a low
prostate-specific antigen (PSA; see 176820) concentration (less than 0.5
ng/ml). They analyzed these samples for 541,129 SNPs. Eeles et al.
(2008) identified a SNP in the MSMB gene, dbSNP rs10993994, that was
significantly associated with prostate cancer (8.7 x 10(-29)). The SNP
dbSNP rs10993994 is 2 basepairs upstream of the transcription start site
of MSMB. The risk allele, T, affects multiple predicted binding sites
for transcription and splicing factors.

Chang et al. (2009) genotyped 16 tagging SNPs and imputed 29 additional
SNPs in a 65-kb genomic region at chromosome 10q11 in a Swedish
population-based case-control study including 2,899 cases and 1,722
controls. They found evidence for 2 independent loci, separated by a
recombination hotspot, associated with prostate cancer risk. Among
multiple significant SNPs at locus 1, the initial SNP, dbSNP rs10993994,
was the most significant. The risk allele of this SNP, T, had only 13%
of the promoter activity of the wildtype allele in a prostate cancer
model, LNCaP cells. Chang et al. (2009) concluded that the T allele of
dbSNP rs10993994 may be a potential causal variant at chromosome 10q11
that confers increased risk of prostate cancer.

By fine-mapping analysis of a 65-kb region on chromosome 10q including
dbSNP rs10993994 in 6,118 prostate cancer cases and 6,105 controls of
European origin, Lou et al. (2009) found that dbSNP rs10993994 remained
the SNP most strongly associated with prostate cancer risk (p = 8.8 x
10(-18); heterozygous odds ratio (OR) of 1.20, homozygous OR of 1.64).
Lou et al. (2009) stated that the SNP was located at position -57. In
vitro functional analysis showed that the T allele was associated with
decreased transcriptional activity and that the C allele preferentially
bound to the CREB transcription factor (123810). Analysis of tumor cell
lines with a CC or CT genotype revealed a higher level of MSMB gene
expression compared to cell lines with a TT genotype. Lou et al. (2009)
suggested that regulation of MSMB expression is a plausible mechanism
accounting for the association with prostate cancer identified at this
locus.

Yeager et al. (2009) sequenced a 97-kb region of chromosome 10q11.2
including the area surrounding the MSMB gene and the NCOA4 gene (601984)
in 70 unrelated individuals, including 36 with prostate cancer. They
identified a 51-kb block of linkage disequilibrium (LD) containing dbSNP
rs10993994 and the proximal promoter of the MSMB gene. No additional
variants in LD with dbSNP rs10993994 were identified, suggesting that
this is the probable variant that accounts for the association with
prostate cancer. In total, 241 novel polymorphisms were identified in
the 97-kb region, but none were in the exons of the MSMB gene. No
polymorphic sites were found in the first 6 exons of the NCOA4 gene, but
several were observed in exons 7 through 10.

606439	TITLE *606439 ATLASTIN GTPase 1; ATL1
;;ATLASTIN;;
SPG3A GENE; SPG3A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ATL1 gene encodes atlastin-1, a dynamin-related GTPase, which plays
a role in formation of the tubular endoplasmic reticulum (ER) network
and in axon elongation in neurons (Zhu et al., 2006; Orso et al., 2009).

CLONING

By positional cloning, Zhao et al. (2001) demonstrated that a form of
autosomal dominant hereditary spastic paraplegia with early onset
(SPG3A; 182600), before the age of 10 years and usually before the age
of 5, is caused by mutation in a GTPase gene. The gene was found to have
no homology to genes that cause other forms of hereditary spastic
paraplegia. It does show significant homology to guanylate binding
protein-1 (GBP1; 600411), a member of the dynamin family of large
GTPases. Northern blot analysis of ATL1 expression detected a 2.2-kb
transcript primarily in adult and fetal brain. RT-PCR experiments
indicated measurable expression in all tissues examined, although
expression in adult brain was at least 50-fold higher than in other
tissues. Translation of the 2.2-kb cDNA sequence of ATL1 yielded a
peptide of 558 amino acids.

By PCR of a cerebral cortex cDNA library, Zhu et al. (2003) cloned ATL1,
which they called atlastin-1. The deduced 558-amino acid protein
contains GTP-binding motifs in its N-terminal half and 2 transmembrane
domains in its C-terminal half. It also has 3 potential N-glycosylation
sites. Western blot analysis of transfected COS-7 cells detected
atlastin-1 at an apparent molecular mass of about 64 kD. Western blot
analysis detected high atlastin-1 expression in human and rat brain
homogenates, with much lower expression in several other human tissues,
including smooth muscle, adrenal gland, kidney, testis, and lung.
Immunohistochemical analysis of rat brain sections detected high
expression of atlastin-1 in cortical neurons of lamina V, pyramidal
neurons in CA1 and CA3 of the hippocampus, and in amygdala and several
thalamic nuclei. Staining was most prominent in the cell soma, with
weaker staining of axons and dendrites. Immunogold labeling detected rat
atlastin-1 predominantly in the cis-Golgi cisternae. Protease protection
assays indicated that the N and C termini of human atlastin-1 were
exposed to the cytoplasmic face of the membrane in transfected cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay, Zhu et al. (2003) determined that
atlastin-1 self-associates. Chemical cross-linking experiments indicated
that atlastin-1 most likely forms a homotetramer of about 230 kD. Zhu et
al. (2003) demonstrated that atlastin-1 has GTPase activity.

Independently, Evans et al. (2006) and Sanderson et al. (2006)
demonstrated that the N-terminal domain of spastin (SPAST; 604277) bound
directly to the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of atlastin, suggesting
that the 2 gene products interact in a common biologic pathway. Evans et
al. (2006) used yeast 2-hybrid analysis and coimmunoprecipitation
studies in HeLa cells, and Sanderson et al. (2006) used yeast 2-hybrid
analysis of a human fetal brain cDNA library and protein pull-down,
coimmunoprecipitation, and colocalization studies in HeLa cells, HEK293T
cells, and mouse NSC34 neuronal cells.

In the developing rat brain, Zhu et al. (2006) found that atlastin-1 was
expressed not only in the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum, but
was also enriched in axonal growth cones and growth cone-like
varicosities along the axons. Atlastin-1 labeling was prominent on
vesicular structures within the growth cones, but not at the plasma
membrane and not at synapses. Knockdown of atlastin-1 using shRNA in
cultured cortical cells inhibited axonal growth. Overall, the findings
suggested that atlastin-1 has diverse functions in neurons, likely
acting both in intracellular membrane trafficking as well as in
expansion at the axonal growth cone. These functional studies suggested
that the early-onset axonopathy observed in SPG3A may result from
abnormal development of axons.

Orso et al. (2009) demonstrated that Drosophila atlastin localizes on
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes and that its loss causes ER
fragmentation. Drosophila atlastin embedded in distinct membranes has
the ability to form trans-oligomeric complexes, and its overexpression
induces enlargement of ER profiles, consistent with excessive fusion of
ER membranes. In vitro experiments confirmed that atlastin autonomously
drives membrane fusion in a GTP-dependent fashion. In contrast,
GTPase-deficient atlastin is inactive, unable to form trans-oligomeric
complexes owing to failure to self-associate, and incapable of promoting
fusion in vitro. The results of Orso et al. (2009) demonstrated that
atlastin mediates membrane tethering and fusion and strongly suggested
that it is the GTPase activity required for ER homotypic fusion.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhao et al. (2001) found that the ATL1 gene contains 14 exons and spans
approximately 69 kb.

MAPPING

Zhao et al. (2001) determined that the ATL1 gene maps to chromosome
14q11-q21. Zhu et al. (2003) stated that the ATL1 gene maps to
chromosome 14q22.1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Spastic Paraplegia 3A

Zhao et al. (2001) identified mutations in the ATL1 gene (see, e.g.,
606439.0001) in families with spastic paraplegia-3A (SPG3A; 182600) in
which linkage to 14q11-q21 had been demonstrated as well as in other
phenotypically similar families without linkage evidence.

Durr et al. (2004) identified mutations in the ATL1 gene in 12 (39%) of
31 families with early-onset autosomal dominant spastic paraplegia. One
family showed incomplete penetrance.

Namekawa et al. (2006) stated that 19 mutations in the ATL1 gene had
been identified in 40 different families. More than 90% of the mutations
were located in exons 4 (12.5%), 7 (27.5%), 8 (17.5%), and 12 (35%).

In COS-7 cells, Zhu et al. (2006) showed that disease-associated
missense mutations in the ATL1 gene were expressed and interacted
strongly with wildtype ATL1, causing a decrease in GTPase activity in a
dominant-negative manner. The GTPase impairment was strongest with the
R217Q mutation (606439.0004), which is located within the GTPase binding
site, but was also observed with other missense mutations (R239C;
606439.0001 and H258R; 606439.0003), suggesting that these regions may
modulate activity.

Beetz et al. (2007) reported a family in which spastic paraplegia
segregated with a deletion of exon 1 of the SPAST gene (604277) in the
proband, her brother, and her 2 sons. Although the proband and her
brother also had a deletion of the ATL1 gene, the ATL1 deletion did not
segregate with the disorder in her sons and had no apparent effect on
the severity of the disorder. The findings suggested that
haploinsufficiency is the pathogenic mechanism for SPG4 (182601),
whereas a dominant-negative effect is the pathogenic mechanism for
SPG3A.

- Hereditary Sensory Neuropathy Type 1D

By genomewide linkage analysis followed by array-based exonic sequencing
of candidate genes, Guelly et al. (2011) identified a heterozygous
mutation in the ATL1 gene (N355K; 606439.0010) as a cause of autosomal
dominant hereditary neuropathy type 1D (HSN1D; 613708) in an affected
family. Screening of this gene in 115 additional probands with a similar
disorder identified 2 additional heterozygous mutations in the ATL1 gene
in 2 unrelated probands (606439.0011 and 606439.0012, respectively). The
phenotype was characterized by adult onset of a distal axonal sensory
neuropathy affecting all modalities, often associated with distal
ulceration and amputation as well as hyporeflexia, although some
patients showed features suggesting upper neuron involvement. In vitro
functional expression studies in COS7 cells did not reveal a common
pathogenetic mechanism, and there was no clear functional distinction
between mutations causing SPG3A and HSN1D, but Guelly et al. (2011)
postulated that a defect in the tubular endoplasmic reticulum may
underlie both disorders.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 3, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
ATL1, ARG239CYS

In affected members of 3 apparently unrelated kindreds with spastic
paraplegia-3 (182600), Zhao et al. (2001) identified a heterozygous
884C-T transition in exon 7 of the ATL1 gene, resulting in an
arg239-to-cys (R239C) substitution.

Abel et al. (2004) identified the R239C mutation in all 22 affected
members of a French family with SPG3 reported by Hazan et al. (1993).
Abel et al. (2004) stated that this was the seventh SPG3 family of
western European descent found to have the R239C mutation. Abel et al.
(2004) reported the nucleotide change as 715C-T, based on numbering from
the translation initiation codon, and noted that position 715 is within
a CpG doublet, suggesting that it is a possible mutation hotspot.

By haplotype analysis of 3 French families with the R239C mutation,
Namekawa et al. (2006) concluded that the mutations arose independently
and were not due to a founder effect. Further analysis confirmed that
the mutation occurred in a hotspot defined by a methylated CpG
dinucleotide.

.0002
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 3, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
ATL1, SER259TYR

In a kindred designated ADHSP-P with early-onset autosomal dominant
spastic paraplegia (182600), Zhao et al. (2001) identified
heterozygosity (both C and A) at nucleotide 945 of the full-length ATL1
cDNA, corresponding to exon 8 of the gene. Unaffected members of the
family had only C at this position. This mutation, TCC (ser) to TAC
(tyr), was predicted to alter amino acid 259. Thus, this mutation,
S259Y, is adjacent to the H258R mutation (606439.0003).

.0003
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 3, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
ATL1, HIS258ARG

Zhao et al. (2001) found that affected members in a kindred with
autosomal dominant hereditary spastic paraplegia of early onset (182600)
were heterozygous (A and G) at nucleotide position 942 of the
full-length cDNA corresponding to the ATL1 gene. Affected members in
this kindred had only C at this position. The mutation was predicted to
result in a his258-to-arg (H258R) amino acid substitution, at a site
adjacent to S259Y (606439.0002).

.0004
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 3, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
ATL1, ARG217GLN

In a large Italian family with early-onset, autosomal dominant
uncomplicated spastic paraplegia (182600), Muglia et al. (2002)
identified an 818G-A mutation in the ATL1 gene, resulting in an
arg217-to-gln substitution in a highly conserved GTPase motif.

.0005
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 3, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
ATL1, 1-BP INS, 1688A

In an Italian family with autosomal dominant hereditary spastic
paraplegia (182600), Tessa et al. (2002) identified a heterozygous 1-bp
insertion, 1688A, in exon 12 of the ATL1 gene, producing a frameshift
and premature stop codon. The resulting protein lacked the last 37 amino
acids, including all of exon 14. Seven clearly affected individuals and
2 asymptomatic individuals with hyperreflexia carried the mutation. The
authors commented on the apparent age-dependent penetrance of the
disorder in this family.

.0006
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 3, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
ATL1, MET408VAL

In a family with 6 members affected with a very early onset severe form
of spastic paraplegia (182600), Dalpozzo et al. (2003) identified a
heterozygous 1222A-G transition in exon 12 of the ATL1 gene, resulting
in a met408-to-val (M408V) substitution. All affected members had onset
in infancy with delayed motor milestones, gait impairment, spastic
paraparesis, distal atrophy, and lower limb weakness. Because of the
very early onset, the first patients were misdiagnosed with cerebral
palsy, and the index patient (mother of 5 affected members) was unaware
that she had a genetically transmissible disease. Two patients had the
unusual sign of mild hand atrophy.

.0007
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 3, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
ATL1, ARG415TRP

In all 3 affected members tested from an Italian family with SPG3A
(182600), D'Amico et al. (2004) identified a heterozygous mutation in
exon 12 of the atlastin gene, resulting in an arg415-to-trp (R415W)
substitution. The mutation was not identified in 400 control
chromosomes. The 3 patients had onset before 5 years of age, and 2
additional family members were reportedly affected by infantile-onset
spastic paraparesis. However, 9 asymptomatic relatives ranging in age
from 13 to 70 years also had the mutation. D'Amico et al. (2004)
concluded that the reduced penetrance of this mutation indicated that
modulator genes or epigenetic factors are involved in the development of
the disease, and they noted the implications for genetic counseling.

Varga et al. (2013) identified a heterozygous c.1243C-T transition in
the ATL1 gene resulting in an R415W substitution in affected members of
a family with SPG3A originally reported by Raggio et al. (1973) as
having a pure spastic paraplegia transmitted in an X-linked pattern of
inheritance. Whole-exome sequencing of 1 of the affected males
identified the heterozygous R415W substitution. This mutation was then
identified in 3 affected family members and in 3 unaffected family
members, consistent with incomplete penetrance. Two of the unaffected
carriers were women, and family history indicated that most unaffected
women were obligate carriers. These findings were consistent with
sex-associated reduced penetrance of this mutation. Varga et al. (2013)
identified the same mutation in 1 of 83 Spanish patients with apparent
sporadic HSP and in 2 of 28 Russian patients with dominant HSP. Evidence
again suggested incomplete penetrance in these families. Varga et al.
(2013) also identified a heterozygous c.1244A-G transition, resulting in
an arg415-to-gln (R415Q; 606439.0014) substitution, in a Moroccan family
with SPG3A and incomplete penetrance. Varga et al. (2013) noted that
both the c.1243C-T and c.1244A-G transitions occur at a CpG nucleotide
(on the plus and minus strands, respectively) and thus may represent a
mutation hotspot due to spontaneous deamination of methylated cytosines.
R415 affects a highly conserved residue that does not localize to a
known protein domain.

SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 3, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
ATL1, LEU157TRP

In a mother and son with SPG3A (182600), Rainier et al. (2006)
identified a heterozygous 638T-C transition in exon 4 of the ATL1 gene,
resulting in a leu157-to-trp (L157W) substitution. The mutation is
predicted to disrupt a putative phosphorylation site of the protein.
Genetic analysis of family members indicated that the mutation occurred
de novo in the mother. The mother was a 34-year-old woman with
uncomplicated nonprogressive spastic paraplegia since infancy who was
originally diagnosed with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy. She was
correctly diagnosed with SPG after her son developed similar clinical
symptoms at age 10 months.

.0009
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 3, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
ATL1, 3-BP DEL

In affected members of a large French Canadian family with SPG3A
(182600), Meijer et al. (2007) identified a heterozygous 3-bp in-frame
deletion in the ATL1 gene, resulting in a deletion of asn436 (436delN).
Functional expression studies showed decreased ATL1 protein levels in
patients' lymphoblasts but normal levels of mRNA, normal GTPase
activity, and normal protein interactions. Meijer et al. (2007)
postulated decreased protein stability and a dominant-negative
loss-of-function mechanism.

.0010
NEUROPATHY, HEREDITARY SENSORY, TYPE ID
ATL1, ASN355LYS

In affected members of a large 4-generation family with autosomal
dominant hereditary sensory neuropathy type ID (HSN1D; 613708), Guelly
et al. (2011) identified a heterozygous 1065C-A transversion in exon 11
of the ATL1 gene, resulting in an asn355-to-lys (N355K) substitution.
The mutation was not found in 370 controls. The phenotype was
characterized by early adult onset of a severe distal st sensory axonal
neuropathy with frequent ulcerations and amputation digits. In vitro
functional expression studies in COS7 cells showed that the mutant
protein had decreased GTPase activity compared to wildtype, and caused
disruption of endoplasmic reticulum 3-way junctions.

.0011
NEUROPATHY, HEREDITARY SENSORY, TYPE ID
ATL1, GLU66GLN

In a 61-year-old man with hereditary sensory neuropathy-1D (HSN1D;
613708), Guelly et al. (2011) identified a heterozygous 196G-C
transversion in exon 2 of the ATL1 gene, resulting in a glu66-to-gln
(E66Q) substitution. He presented with progressive, ascending, severe
sensory loss affecting all modalities in the lower legs, but no foot
ulcerations or paresis. He had hyporeflexia, and sural nerve biopsy
revealed a severe, chronic, axonal neuropathy with a moderate
demyelinating component. The patient's deceased mother reportedly had a
similar severe sensory neuropathy. The mutation was not found in 150
control individuals, but in vitro functional expression studies showed
no change in GTPase activity and no changes in endoplasmic reticulum
morphology.

.0012
NEUROPATHY, HEREDITARY SENSORY, TYPE ID
ATL1, 1-BP DEL, 976G

In a man with hereditary sensory neuropathy-1D (HSN1D; 613708), Guelly
et al. (2011) identified a heterozygous 1-bp deletion (976delG) in exon
9 of the ATL1 gene, resulting in premature termination in the C
terminus. The patient had adult-onset sensory neuropathy with
ulcerations, lack of pain perception, paresthesias in the fingers, and
occasional lancinating pains in his ankles. Patellar tendon reflexes
were brisk, and Achilles tendon reflexes were absent. His father and
brother were similarly affected. The mutation was not found in 334
control individuals. In vitro functional expression studies showed
decreased expression of the truncated protein and diffuse localization
throughout the cytoplasm instead of proper localization to the
endoplasmic reticulum.

.0013
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 3, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
ATL1, ARG416CYS

In affected members of a 3-generation South African Zulu family with
autosomal dominant SPG3A (182600), Orlacchio et al. (2011) identified a
heterozygous 1246C-T transition in exon 12 of the ATL1 gene, resulting
in an arg416-to-cys (R416C) substitution. The mutation was not found in
400 controls. The phenotype in this family was unusual in that affected
individuals had late onset (range 38 to 56 years), mild mental
retardation (IQ 32 to 67), and thin corpus callosum without cerebellar
involvement or white matter abnormalities. Spasticity was restricted to
the lower limbs; 3 patients had sphincter disturbances.

.0014
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 3, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
ATL1, ARG415GLN

In 4 Moroccan sibs with SPG3A (182600), Varga et al. (2013) identified a
c.1244A-G transition in the ATL1 gene, resulting in an arg415-to-gln
(R415Q) substitution. Three sibs were homozygous and 1 was heterozygous
for the mutation. Heterozygosity for the mutation was then found in 3
unaffected family members and in 2 family members who had very subtle
signs of the disorder (hyperreflexia). These findings suggested complete
penetrance for the mutation in homozygous state and incomplete
penetrance for the mutation in heterozygous state. Varga et al. (2013)
also identified a heterozygous c.1243C-T transition, resulting in an
R415W (606439.0007) substitution in another family with SPG3A and
incomplete penetrance. Varga et al. (2013) noted that both the c.1243C-T
and c.1244A-G transitions occur at a CpG nucleotide (on the plus and
minus strands, respectively) and thus may represent a mutation hotspot
due to spontaneous deamination of methylated cytosines. R415 is a highly
conserved residue that does not localize to a known protein domain.

601070	TITLE *601070 INTERLEUKIN 15 RECEPTOR, ALPHA; IL15RA
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Interleukin-2 (IL2; 147680) and interleukin-15 (IL15; 600554) are
cytokines with overlapping but distinct biologic effects. Their
receptors share 2 subunits, the IL2R beta (146710) and gamma (308380)
chains, which are essential for signal transduction. The IL2 receptor
requires an additional IL2-specific alpha subunit (IL2RA; 147730) for
high-affinity IL2 binding. Giri et al. (1995) identified and cloned a
murine IL15-specific alpha subunit and showed that it is structurally
related to IL2R-alpha.

Anderson et al. (1995) isolated 3 differentially spliced human
IL15R-alpha variants.

Using RT-PCR, Dubois et al. (1999) cloned 8 IL15RA isoforms, including
the 3 reported by Anderson et al. (1995). The first 4 isoforms include
the full-length form containing exons 1 through 7 and forms lacking exon
2, exon 3, or both exons 2 and 3. The remaining 4 isoforms are identical
to the first 4 except that they contain an alternative C-terminal exon,
exon 7-prime, that is 100 bp shorter than exon 7. These 8 isoforms were
detected in most cell lines and tissues examined. Western blot analysis
using cDNAs encoding the full-length isoform and the isoform lacking
exon 2 (exon 7 forms of both) showed that both proteins were extensively
N- and O-glycosylated. Confocal microscopy demonstrated that full-length
IL15RA was associated primarily with the nuclear membrane, with part of
the receptor having an intranuclear localization. Isoforms lacking exon
2, which encodes a protein-binding sushi domain with a putative nuclear
localization signal, showed extranuclear localization in the endoplasmic
reticulum, Golgi, and cytoplasmic vesicles. Loss of exon 3 had no effect
on IL15RA localization. Immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that
smaller amounts of IL15RA and IL15RA lacking exon 2 were expressed as
glycosylated proteins on the cell surface.

GENE FUNCTION

Giri et al. (1995) found that the murine IL15R-alpha subunit alone bound
IL15 with a 1,000-fold higher affinity than that seen with IL2R-alpha
and IL2.

Anderson et al. (1995) found that all 3 human IL15R-alpha variants they
identified were capable of high-affinity binding of IL15. The
cytoplasmic domain of IL15R-alpha, like that of IL2R-alpha, was
dispensable for mitogenic signaling, suggesting that the primary role of
the alpha chains is to confer high-affinity binding. At high
concentrations, IL15, like IL2, was able to signal through a complex of
IL2R-beta and -gamma in the absence of the alpha subunit.

Dubois et al. (1999) found that, in contrast to full-length IL15RA,
IL15RA isoforms lacking exon 2 were unable to bind IL15.

Using radioimmunoassays, Mortier et al. (2004) identified a 42-kD
soluble form of IL15RA released by a proteolytic shedding mechanism from
the plasma membrane. The soluble receptor displayed high affinity for
IL15 and inhibited both binding of IL15 to the membrane receptor and
IL15-induced cell proliferation.

Mortier et al. (2006) found that, in contrast to the behavior of the
natural soluble form of IL15RA, a recombinant, soluble sushi domain of
IL15RA behaved as a potent IL15 agonist by enhancing binding of IL15 to
the IL2RB/IL2RG complex and increasing IL15 bioactivity. A fusion
protein of IL15 and the IL15RA sushi domain was an even stronger agonist
of the IL2RB/IL2RG complex.

Rubinstein et al. (2006) found that stimulation of mouse
memory-phenotype Cd8-positive T cells, which express high levels of Cd44
(107269) and Il2rb, with a complex of either human or mouse soluble
IL15/IL15RA resulted in a strong lymphoproliferative response that was
greater than the response to IL15 alone. The lymphoproliferative
response was mediated solely through the Il2rb/Il2rg receptor.
Administration of mouse soluble Il15/Il15ra in vivo caused nearly all
transferred memory-phenotype Cd8-positive cells to divide multiple
times, whereas only about half did so in response to Il15 alone. In
contrast to the ability of soluble IL15RA to potentiate the function of
IL15, soluble IL2RA blocked the function of IL2. Rubinstein et al.
(2006) concluded that the IL15/IL15RA complex has enhanced effects on
T-cell survival compared with IL15 alone.

To examine whether tolerant T cells could be rescued and functionally
restored for use in therapy of established tumors, Teague et al. (2006)
studied a transgenic T-cell receptor mouse model in which Cd8-positive T
cells specific for a candidate tumor antigen also expressed in liver
were tolerant. FACS analysis showed that these tolerant T cells
expressed Il15ra, and treatment of the cells with Il15 induced
proliferation and Il2 secretion. Such proliferation abrogated tolerance,
and the rescued cells could effectively treat leukemia. Teague et al.
(2006) concluded that high-affinity CD8-positive T cells are not
necessarily deleted by encounter with self-antigen in the periphery and
can be rescued and expanded for use in tumor immunotherapy.

By flow cytometric and confocal microscopy analyses, Brilot et al.
(2007) found that cell-to-cell contact between mature dendritic cells
(DCs) and natural killer (NK) cells occurred rapidly and induced
intracellular calcium release and upregulation of CD69 (107273).
Formation of a synapse between the 2 cell types required the adhesion
molecules LFA1 (see 153370) and LFA3 (153420), induced expression of
IL15RA, and was necessary for NK cell survival. Il15ra-deficient NK
cells obtained from donors with a history of infectious mononucleosis or
IL15RA-positive NK cells treated with anti-IL15RA showed reduced NK
survival after coculture with mature DCs. Brilot et al. (2007) concluded
that mature DCs interact with and activate resting NK cells via
formation of a regulatory synapse. They proposed that IL15RA expression
on NK cells is required for optimal NK/DC interaction and that IL15RA
mediates cell contact-dependent NK cell survival.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Chirifu et al. (2007) noted that IL2 and IL15 are recognized by the
alpha units of their receptors (IL2RA and IL15RA, respectively), but
that signaling is mediated by the common gamma chain, IL2RG. The
receptors for the 2 cytokines also share the beta unit, IL2RB. Chirifu
et al. (2007) determined the 1.85-angstrom crystal structure of the
IL15-IL15RA complex. The findings highlighted the importance of water in
generating the high-affinity complex and revealed that the topologies of
the IL15-IL15RA and IL2-IL2RA complexes are similar.

GENE STRUCTURE

Dubois et al. (1999) determined that the IL15RA gene contains 8 exons,
including an alternative C-terminal exon that they designated exon
7-prime.

MAPPING

Anderson et al. (1995) stated that the IL15RA and IL2RA genes have a
similar intron/exon organization and are closely linked in both human
and murine genomes. The IL2RA gene had been previously mapped to
chromosome 10p15-p14 and its mouse homolog to chromosome 2. Anderson et
al. (1995) mapped the human IL15RA gene to chromosome 10p15-p14 by FISH
and the mouse Il15ra gene to chromosome 2 by interspecific backcross
mapping.

606556	TITLE *606556 TRIPARTITE MOTIF-CONTAINING PROTEIN 14; TRIM14
;;KIAA0129
DESCRIPTION TRIM proteins are composed of 3 zinc-binding domains, a RING, a B-box
type 1, and a B-box type 2, followed by a coiled-coil region. They are
involved in development and cell growth.

CLONING

By sequencing cDNAs randomly selected from a cDNA library derived from
the human immature myeloid cell line KG-1, Nagase et al. (1995)
identified a partial cDNA encoding TRIM14, which they called KIAA0129.
The deduced 406-amino acid protein is 25% identical to RFP (602165).
Northern blot analysis revealed wide expression of KIAA0129 that was
highest in liver but undetectable in skeletal muscle.

By EST database searching for B-box-containing proteins, Reymond et al.
(2001) identified 37 TRIM members, including 2 isoforms of TRIM14.
Northern blot analysis revealed ubiquitous expression of a 5.0-kb TRIM14
transcript. Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated expression in
cytoplasmic speckles. Confocal microscopy failed to identify a
subcellular localization. Interaction mating analysis indicated that
TRIM14 does not form a homodimer.

MAPPING

By analysis of a human/rodent hybrid cell panel, Nagase et al. (1995)
mapped the TRIM14 gene to chromosome 9. Reymond et al. (2001) refined
the localization to 9q22-q31 using radiation hybrid analysis.
