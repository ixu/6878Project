;;ADAPTOR PROTEIN CONTAINING PH AND SH2 DOMAINS; APS
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Stimulation of the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR), which consists of
membrane immunoglobulin (Ig) and an associated Ig-alpha (CD79A;
112205)/Ig-beta (CD79B; 147245) heterodimer, results in rapid increases
in tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of proteins. By performing a
yeast 2-hybrid screen on a B-cell cDNA library with the KIT (164920)
kinase domain as bait, Yokouchi et al. (1997) obtained a cDNA encoding
APS. The deduced 632-amino acid APS adaptor protein contains a
pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, an Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, and a
C-terminal tyrosine phosphorylation site. APS is structurally similar to
the T-cell adaptor protein/signal transducer LNK (605093). Northern blot
analysis detected a 2.3-kb APS transcript in spleen, prostate, testis,
uterus, small intestine, and skeletal muscle, and a smaller transcript
in peripheral blood leukocytes. APS was expressed in B-cell lymphoma but
not other hematopoietic cell lines. Immunoblot analysis determined that
APS was expressed as an 85-kD protein that was tyrosine-phosphorylated
after BCR cross-linking with anti-IgM. Immunoprecipitation analysis
indicated that APS associates with SHC (600560) regardless of BCR
stimulation and with GRB2 (108355) only after BCR stimulation.

GENE STRUCTURE

By large-scale genomic sequencing, Glockner et al. (1998) found that the
APS gene contains 9 exons and spans at least 36.5 kb.

GENE FUNCTION

Liu et al. (2002) presented evidence that mammalian APS serves as an
adaptor protein linking the CAP (605264)/CBL (165360) pathway to the
insulin receptor (INSR; 147670). Further, APS-facilitated CBL tyrosine
phosphorylation catalyzed by INSR is crucial in stimulating glucose
transport by insulin.

MAPPING

By large-scale genomic sequencing, Glockner et al. (1998) found that the
APS gene maps to chromosome 7q22.

609190	TITLE *609190 ANTI-SILENCING FUNCTION 1, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF, B; ASF1B
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using TLK1 (608438) and TLK2 (608439) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen
of a peripheral lymphocyte cDNA library, Sillje and Nigg (2001) cloned
ASF1B and ASF1A (609189). The deduced 203-amino acid ASF1B protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 22.4 kD. ASF1B and ASF1A share 71% amino
acid identity, and they share about 50% identity with yeast Asf1, which
has a C-terminal acidic stretch not found in the human ASF1 proteins.

GENE FUNCTION

Sillje and Nigg (2001) found that in vitro translated ASF1A and ASF1B
were phosphorylated by TLK1 and TLK2. The levels of ASF1A and ASF1B were
unchanged during the cell cycle in synchronized HeLa cells.

Mello et al. (2002) found that ASF1A and ASF1B interacted directly and
functioned synergistically with human CAF1 (see 601245) to assemble
nucleosomes during nucleotide excision repair in vitro.

Groth et al. (2007) characterized the complex in which the human histone
chaperone ASF1 and MCM2-7 (see 116945), the putative replicative
helicase, are connected through a histone H3-H4 bridge. Depletion of
ASF1 by RNA interference impeded DNA unwinding at replication sites, and
similar defects arose from overproduction of new histone H3-H4 that
compromised ASF1 function. Groth et al. (2007) concluded that their data
link ASF1 chaperone function, histone supply, and replicative unwinding
of DNA in chromatin. Groth et al. (2007) proposed that ASF1, as a
histone acceptor and donor, handles parental and new histones at the
replication fork via an ASF1-(H3-H4)-MCM2-7 intermediate and thus
provides a means to fine-tune replication fork progression and histone
supply and demand.

MAPPING

Hartz (2005) mapped the ASF1B gene to chromosome 19p13.13 based on an
alignment of the ASF1B sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB104486) with the
genomic sequence.

611119	TITLE *611119 KELCH-LIKE 7; KLHL7
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

BTB (bric-a-brac, tramtrack, and broad complex) domain-containing
proteins, such as KLHL7, function as substrate recognition subunits for
cullin-3 (CUL3; 603136)-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes that
polyubiquitinate target proteins for proteasome-mediated degradation
(Kigoshi et al., 2011).

CLONING

By immunoscreening a rat cerebellum cDNA expression library with
anti-Hu-positive sera from 3 patients with paraneoplastic
encephalomyelitis (PEM), Bredholt et al. (2006) cloned rat Klhl7 and
obtained the human KLHL7 cDNA sequence. The deduced 586-amino acid KLHL7
protein contains a predicted N-terminal BTB domain, a BACK domain, and a
C-terminal region containing Kelch repeats, and at least 1 potential
monopartite nuclear localization signal. The rat Klhl7 protein shares
97.8% and 99.4% sequence identity with the human and mouse orthologs,
respectively. Northern blot analysis detected a 3-kb transcript in rat
cerebellum, rat brain, and mixed human tissue RNAs. Dot-blot analysis
detected KLHL7 mRNA in all human tissues and cancer cell lines tested,
with highest expression in adult and fetal heart, adult and fetal
nervous system, and adult testis. Immunohistochemical studies of human
brain tissues localized KLHL7 to the nuclei of neurons, including
pyramidal cells of the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, cerebellar
Purkinje cells, posterior root ganglion cells, and spinal cord anterior
horn cells. KLHL7 protein was not detected in tissues other than brain.
Immunohistochemical studies of various cancer cells and cell lines
detected KLHL7 protein in HeLa and Hep2 cell nuclei.

GENE FUNCTION

Using immunoprecipitation of patient sera, Bredholt et al. (2006)
detected KLHL7 antibodies in 1 of the 3 initial paraneoplastic
encephalomyelitis patients, 12 of 254 patients with various cancers, 2
of 170 blood donors, and 7 of 151 patient sera samples sent for
detection of paraneoplastic antibodies. Bredholt et al. (2006) concluded
that KLHL7 antibodies are associated with various cancers and in some
patients also with neurologic disease.

By immunoprecipitation analysis of HeLa cells and HCT116 human colon
carcinoma cells expressing epitope-tagged proteins, Kigoshi et al.
(2011) showed that KLHL7 interacted with CUL3 and ROC1 (RBX1; 603814).
KLHL7 also formed homodimers. Mutation analysis of KLHL7 showed that the
BTB domain was necessary for homodimerization, that the BACK domain
increased homodimerization efficiency, and that the BTB and BACK domains
of KLHL7 mediated interaction with CUL3. KLHL7 was monoubiquitinated and
colocalized in cytoplasmic punctae with lys48-linked polyubiquitinated
proteins. The size of punctae increased following proteasome inhibition.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bredholt et al. (2006) determined that the KLHL7 gene contains 40
alternative exons and spans 69.67 kb. Friedman et al. (2009) stated that
the KLHL7 gene contains 12 exons and that alternative 5-prime exons
result in 2 isoforms with distinct N-terminal regions.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Bredholt et al. (2006) mapped the KLHL7
gene to chromosome 7p15.3

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a large 6-generation Scandinavian family with a slow-progressing
retinopathy mapping to chromosome 7p15 (RP42; 612943) (family 72
previously studied by Andreasson, 1991), Friedman et al. (2009)
identified a heterozygous mutation in the KLHL7 gene (S150N;
611119.0001) that segregated completely with disease in the 24 family
members that were examined. The mutation was not found in 470 controls,
including 102 from Scandinavia. Friedman et al. (2009) then screened the
KLHL7 gene in 504 unrelated probands with autosomal dominant RP (adRP)
and identified the S150N mutation in a North American family; 2
additional mutations (611119.0002 and 611119.0003) were identified in 3
families and 1 proband, respectively. On the basis of a cohort
previously used for ascertaining prevalence of adRP (Sullivan et al.,
2006), Friedman et al. (2009) estimated that the KLHL7 gene is
responsible for 1 to 2% of adRP.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 42
KLHL7, SER150ASN

In a large 6-generation Scandinavian family with a slow-progressing
retinopathy (RP42; 612943) (family 72 previously studied by Andreasson ,
1991), Friedman et al. (2009) identified a 449G-A transition in exon 6
of the KLHL7 gene, resulting in a ser150to-asn (S150N) substitution at a
highly conserved residue that segregated completely with disease. The
S150N mutation was also identified in 2 affected individuals from a
3-generation North American RP family (family RFS073), but was not found
in 102 Scandinavian, 183 North American, or 185 U.K. controls.

.0002
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 42
KLHL7, ALA153VAL

In affected members of 3 unrelated families from Scandinavia, North
America, and the U.K. with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa
(RP42; 612943), Friedman et al. (2009) identified a 458C-T transition in
exon 6 of the KLHL7 gene, resulting in an ala153-to-val (A153V)
substitution at a highly conserved residue. The mutation was not found
in 102 Scandinavian, 183 North American, or 185 U.K. controls.

Kigoshi et al. (2011) showed that the A153V substitution abrogated
interaction and colocalization of KLHL7 with CUL3 (603136). KLHL7 with
A153V could form heterodimers with wildtype KLHL7 and did not interfere
with interaction between wildtype KLHL7 and CUL3. However, inclusion of
KLHL7 with A153V reduced the apparent E3 ligase activity of the wildtype
KLHL7-CUL3 complex.

.0003
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 42
KLHL7, ALA153THR

In the proband of a North American family with autosomal dominant
retinitis pigmentosa (RP42; 612943), Friedman et al. (2009) identified a
457G-A transition in exon 6 of the KLHL7 gene, resulting in an
ala153-to-thr (A153T) substitution at a highly conserved residue. The
mutation was not found in 102 Scandinavian, 183 North American, or 185
U.K. controls.

Kigoshi et al. (2011) showed that the A153T substitution abrogated
interaction and colocalization of KLHL7 with CUL3 (603136).

600287	TITLE *600287 GLYCYL-tRNA SYNTHETASE; GARS
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases perform an essential function in protein
synthesis by catalyzing the esterification of an amino acid to its
cognate tRNA. These enzymes are necessarily present in each cell and
must properly recognize the tRNA and the amino acid in order to maintain
fidelity of translation. From the primary structures, 2 distinct classes
of synthetases have been recognized, with similarity of certain
structural features, amino acid attachment sites, and other properties
between members of a class. Certain aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are
autoantigens in patients with the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies,
polymyositis, and dermatomyositis. Autoantibodies reactive with
synthetases are found almost exclusively in these conditions, with
individuals usually having autoantibodies to only a single synthetase.
Most commonly they are directed at histidyl-tRNA synthetase (142810),
labeled 'anti-Jo-1' autoantibodies. Ge et al. (1994) used a cDNA
encoding the human form of glycyl-tRNA synthetase for isolation of
corresponding cDNAs. Shiba et al. (1994) likewise cloned a class II
human glycyl-tRNA synthetase and compared its structure with that of the
bacterial counterpart from which it was found to diverge widely.

Williams et al. (1995) also cloned the human GARS cDNA. The predicted
685-amino acid protein showed approximately 45% identity to the yeast
protein. The recombinantly expressed protein was immunoprecipitated with
human serum containing autoantibodies to glycyl-tRNA synthetase and was
shown to catalyze the aminoacylation of tRNA.

MAPPING

Nichols et al. (1995) mapped the GARS gene to chromosome 7p15 by FISH
analysis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Antonellis et al. (2003) identified mutations in the GARS gene in
families with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2D (CMT2D; 601472) and in
families with distal hereditary motor neuronopathy type VA (HMN5A;
600794); see 600287.0001-600287.0003.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using positional cloning, Seburn et al. (2006) found that a
mutagenesis-induced dominant mouse model Nmf249 was caused by an
in-frame indel mutation at pro278 in the Gars gene. Affected mice had a
sensorimotor polyneuropathy with overt neuromuscular dysfunction by 3
weeks of age, smaller size, and shortened life spans compared to
wildtype mice. Mutant mice showed neurodegenerative changes at the
neuromuscular junction, with more severe changes at distal muscles.
Nerve conduction velocities were severely decreased, and peripheral
nerves showed reduced axonal diameters and loss of large-diameter axons,
but no evidence of demyelination. Homozygous mutant mice were embryonic
lethal. The affected pro278 residue is near the catalytic domain-2 of
the protein, but the mutation did not affect Gars mRNA levels, and the
recombinant mutant enzyme showed normal kinetics and activity. The
findings were not consistent with either loss of function
(haploinsufficiency) or a dominant-negative loss-of-function effect, but
Seburn et al. (2006) postulated aberrant pathogenic function of the
mutant protein.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AXONAL, TYPE 2D
GARS, GLY240ARG

In 2 families with CMT2D (601472) first reported by Ionasescu et al.
(1996) and Pericak-Vance et al. (1997), Antonellis et al. (2003)
identified a 1236G-C change in the GARS gene, resulting in a
gly240-to-arg (G240R) substitution. The mutation was absent in 368
unrelated chromosomes.

.0002
NEURONOPATHY, DISTAL HEREDITARY MOTOR, TYPE V
GARS, LEU129PRO

In a family with distal HMN type VA (HMN5A; 600794) first reported by
Christodoulou et al. (1995), Antonellis et al. (2003) identified a
904C-T change in the GARS gene, resulting in a leu129-to-pro (L129P)
substitution. The mutation was absent in 376 unrelated chromosomes.

.0003
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AXONAL, TYPE 2D
NEURONOPATHY, DISTAL HEREDITARY MOTOR, TYPE V, INCLUDED
GARS, GLU71GLY

In a large family in which affected members had either CMT2D (601472) or
dHMN type VA (600794) first reported by Sambuughin et al. (1998),
Antonellis et al. (2003) identified a 730A-G mutation in the GARS gene,
resulting in a glu71-to-gly (E71G) substitution. The mutation was absent
in 398 unrelated chromosomes.

.0004
NEURONOPATHY, DISTAL HEREDITARY MOTOR, TYPE V
GARS, GLY526ARG

In a family with dHMN type VA (600794), Antonellis et al. (2003)
identified a 2094G-C mutation in exon 14 of the GARS gene, resulting in
a gly526-to-arg (G526R) substitution. The mutation was absent in 360
unrelated chromosomes.

Dubourg et al. (2006) identified the G526R mutation in 12 affected
members from 3 French families of Sephardic Jewish origin with HMN type
V. Four mutation carriers were clinically asymptomatic, suggesting
incomplete penetrance. Most presented with distal upper limb involvement
between the second and fourth decades; none had sensory involvement.
Haplotype analysis suggested a founder effect.

.0005
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AXONAL, TYPE 2D
NEURONOPATHY, DISTAL HEREDITARY MOTOR, TYPE V, INCLUDED
GARS, ASP500ASN

In a large Italian multigenerational family in which affected members
had either CMT2D (601472) or dHMN type VA (600794), Del Bo et al. (2006)
identified a heterozygous 2016G-A transition in exon 13 of the GARS
gene, resulting in an asp500-to-asn (D500N) substitution. The mutation
was not identified in 100 control Italian individuals. There was broad
intrafamilial phenotype variability, with some members presenting
symptoms in childhood and some in adulthood. Sensory involvement was
variable.

.0006
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AXONAL, TYPE 2D
GARS, PRO244LEU

In a Japanese patient with CMT2D (601472), Abe and Hayasaka (2009)
identified a heterozygous 893C-T transition in the GARS gene, resulting
in a pro244-to-leu (P244L) substitution in the catalytic domain. The
mutation was not identified in 100 controls, is conserved among species,
and was predicted to alter the secondary structure of the polypeptide.
The patient had onset of the disorder in adolescence and early
upper-limb involvement. No mutations in the GARS gene were found in 109
additional Japanese patients with axonal CMT, suggesting that GARS
mutations are a rare cause of the disorder in this population.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The F13A1 gene encodes the A subunit of factor XIII (EC 2.3.2.13), the
last enzyme generated in the blood coagulation cascade. It is the
zymogen for fibrinoligase, a transglutaminase that forms intramolecular
gamma-glutamyl-epsilon-lysine crosslinking between fibrin molecules and
thus stabilizes blood clots. Plasma factor XIII is composed of 2 A
subunits, which have catalytic function, and 2 noncatalyic B subunits
(F13B; 134580), which likely act as carriers proteins. However, both
platelet and placental factor XIII are composed only of 2 A subunits.
All forms of factor XIII are proteolytically activated by thrombin (F2;
176930) (Takahashi et al., 1986).

CLONING

Takahashi et al. (1986) and Grundmann et al. (1986) characterized the
amino acid sequence and the cDNA, respectively, of the alpha subunit of
placental factor XIII. Takahashi et al. (1986) determined that subunit A
of factor XIII is an unglycosylated 730-residue peptide with a molecular
mass of 83 kD. They identified putative thrombin and calcium-binding
sites. Grundmann et al. (1986) isolated cDNAs corresponding to placental
F13A, which predicted a 732-residue protein. A 4-kb mRNA species was
identified, but no leader sequence was found. Electrophoretic studies
showed that the A subunits expressed in placenta and in the circulation
are products of the same gene locus.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ichinose and Davie (1988) determined that the F13A1 gene contains 15
exons and spans over 160 kb. Five distinct functional domains were
encoded by separate exons.

MAPPING

Olaisen et al. (1984) found linkage between the A component of factor
XIII and the MHC complex (see, e.g., 142800) on chromosome 6p. The
maximum lod score for males was 6.89 at theta = 0.08; for females it was
0.14 at theta = 0.44. No indication of linkage to PGM3 (172100) on
chromosome 6q was found. Using polymorphism of F13A in family studies,
Eiberg et al. (1984) confirmed linkage with HLA (maximum lod = 5.18 at
theta = 0.17 in males and 0.14 at theta = 0.37 in females). In a family
segregating for all 3 loci, the gene order F13A, HLA, and GLO (138750)
on 6p21 was established. Board et al. (1984) concluded that the F13A
locus is distal to HLA, probably in the 6p22 region. In a later
publication, Olaisen et al. (1985) reported a maximum lod score, in
males, of 7.60 at theta of 0.18 for the F13A versus HLA linkage. Since
the Hageman factor gene (F12; 610619) is located in the same region of
6p, there may be a cluster of coagulation genes there.

HGM8 (Helsinki, 1985) placed the F13A locus in the segment of chromosome
6pter-p23.

Nishigaki et al. (1986) commented on the conflicting evidence on linkage
of HLA and F13A. In their own studies, the maximum lod score was only
0.33 for males at theta = 0.30; in females the lod score was negative at
all values of theta. Zoghbi et al. (1988) found 3 RFLPs at the F13A
locus. Together they showed heterozygosity of 91%. Using these markers,
they found linkage to HLA with a maximum lod score of 11.44 at a
recombination fraction of 0.25 for males and 0.35 for females. Wong et
al. (1988) reported information on the linkage relationship of F13A to
HLA, GLO1, and PLG (173350), based on the analysis of 44 kindreds. In
their study, paternal F13A-HLA lod scores peaked at theta = 0.09;
maternal F13A-HLA lod scores peaked at theta = 0.20. Paternal F13A-GLO1
lod scores peaked at theta = 0.22; maternal F13A-GLO1 lod scores were
negative at all theta values tested. Linkage data obtained for F13A and
PLG indicated that the 2 loci are not closely linked. The following gene
order was proposed: 6pter--F13A--HLA--GLO1--cen.

Using a cDNA fragment encoding the amino terminal region of the A
subunit as derived from a placental library, Board et al. (1988) mapped
the F13A gene to chromosome 6p25-p24.

GENE FUNCTION

AbdAlla et al. (2004) reported that intracellular factor XIIIA
transglutaminase crosslinks agonist-induced AT1 receptor (106165)
homodimers via gln315 in the C-terminal tail of the AT1 receptor. The
crosslinked dimers displayed enhanced signaling and desensitization in
vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of angiotensin II release or of factor
XIIIA activity prevented formation of crosslinked AT1 receptor dimers.
In agreement with this finding, factor XIIIA-deficient individuals
lacked crosslinked AT1 dimers. Elevated levels of crosslinked AT1 dimers
were present on monocytes of patients with hypertension and correlated
with an enhanced angiotensin II-dependent monocyte adhesion to
endothelial cells. Elevated levels of crosslinked AT1 receptor dimers on
monocytes could sustain the process of atherogenesis, because inhibition
of angiotensin II generation or of intracellular factor XIIIA activity
suppressed the appearance of crosslinked AT1 receptors and symptoms of
atherosclerosis in ApoE (107741)-deficient mice.

Using an atomic force-fluorescence microscopy technique, Liu et al.
(2006) determined the extensibility and elastic limit of fibers formed
in the presence and absence of factor XIIIa. Samples without factor
XIIIa showed no crosslinking. Uncrosslinked fibers extended 226 +/- 52%,
and crosslinked fibers extended 332 +/- 71%, or 4.32 times their
original length. The most extreme fibers could be extended over 6 times
their length. These extensibilities are the largest of any protein
fiber. Liu et al. (2006) tested the elastic limit by stretching fibers
to a certain strain and releasing the applied force. Uncrosslinked
fibers could be stretched 2.2 times their length and recover
elastically. Crosslinked fibers could be stretched over 2.8 times their
length (180% strain) and still recover without permanent damage. Liu et
al. (2006) concluded that the effect of crosslinking is unusual in
fibrin. In collagen, spider silk, and keratin fibers, crosslinking makes
fibers stiffer and less extensible. The increased extensibility and
elasticity observed for crosslinked fibrin indicates the crosslinks are
directional, along the fiber axis. Thus, Liu et al. (2006) concluded
that in physiologic conditions, the fast-forming gamma-gamma crosslinks
(see fibrinogen-gamma, 134850) along the axis may enhance elasticity and
prevent rupture of the nascent fibers. These data suggested that clot
rupture does not arise from the rupture of individual fibers, as had
been assumed; rather, the branch points of the network forming the clot
yield first.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Board (1979) described genetic polymorphism of the A subunits. Data on
gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by Roychoudhury and
Nei (1988).

In a Japanese man with factor XIII deficiency (613225) and a lifelong
bleeding tendency, Kamura et al. (1992) identified a homozygous 2-bp
deletion in the F13A1 gene (210delAG; 134570.0001). He was born of
consanguineous parents.

Coggan et al. (1995) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations
in the F13A1 gene (Y441X; 134570.0004 and N60K; 134570.0005) in a family
with a bleeding disorder. They also identified a mutation (G501R;
134570.0006) responsible for abnormal electrophoretic mobility and
decreased thermal stability of plasma and platelet subunit A in another
family.

Kangsadalampai et al. (1999) identified 2 different homozygous mutations
in the F13A1 gene (V414F; 134570.0008 and R260H; 134570.0009,
respectively) in 2 unrelated patients with factor XIII deficiency.
Functional expression studies in yeast showed that both mutations
resulted in decreased catalytic activity and decreased levels of
expressed enzyme.

HISTORY

Sebetan (1988) studied variants of the A subunit of factor XIII using
ultrathin-layer polyacrylamide gel isoelectric focusing in 1 M urea
followed by immunoblotting. The pattern of unrelated bands were
interpreted as indicating the presence of 3 structural gene loci which
Sebetan (1988) designated F13A1, F13A2, and F13A3, F13A1 being the locus
for which mendelian variation had previously been identified. Sebetan
(1988) identified polymorphism of the F13A2 locus; the F13A3 locus was
found to be monomorphic. The data of Sebetan (1988) may be faulted by
the fact that the samples were not incubated with neuraminidase before
isoelectric focusing so that effects of glycosylation are unknown.
Treatment of plasma with neuraminidase before electrophoresis is
necessary for consistent phenotyping (McAlpine, 1989). Kamboh and
Ferrell (1989) reviewed the reasons for doubting the existence of more
than one F13A locus and suggested further studies for settling the
question.

ANIMAL MODEL

Lauer et al. (2002) generated transgenic mice with targeted deletion of
exon 7 of the F13a gene. FXIII transglutaminase activity in plasma was
reduced to about 50% in mice heterozygous for the mutant allele and was
abolished in homozygous null mice. Homozygous mutant mice were fertile,
but showed impaired reproduction with increased maternal death during
gestation. Homozygous mice showed bleeding episodes, with hematothorax,
hematoperitoneum, and subcutaneous hemorrhage, resulting in decreased
survival. Mutant mice also showed prolonged bleeding times and impaired
clot stabilization. Replacement with human plasma FXIII restored
bleeding time. The phenotype in homozygous mutant mice recapitulated the
key features of the human disorder.

Inbal et al. (2005) found that FXIII-deficient transgenic mice,
generated by targeted disruption of the F13a gene, showed impaired wound
healing compared to wildtype mice and to FXIII-deficient mice treated
with FXIII. The FXIII-deficient untreated mice showed a 15%, 27%, and
27% decrease in percentage of wound closure on day 4, 8, and 11,
respectively, compared to the control groups. Complete healing (100%
closure) was observed in control mice on day 11, whereas FXIII-deficient
and FXIII-deficient/FXIII-treated mice showed 73.23% and 90.06% closure,
respectively. A scoring system representing maturation rate of the
wounds yielded scores of 94.9, 61.5, and 94.5 in the 3 groups,
respectively. Histologic analysis on day 11 showed delayed
reepithelization and necrotized fissures in FXIII-deficient mice,
compared to normal healing in FXIII-deficient and FXIII-treated mice.
Wounds of the FXIII-deficient mice had healing irregularities, with an
irregular border, shape, and color. The findings confirmed that FXIII
deficiency delays skin wound healing, indicating an essential role for
FXIII in wound repair and remodeling.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
FACTOR XIII, A SUBUNIT, DEFICIENCY OF
F13A1, 2-BP DEL, 210AG

In a 52-year-old Japanese man, the offspring of first-cousin parents,
Kamura et al. (1992) demonstrated that deficiency of factor XIII
(613225) resulted from a homozygous 2-bp deletion (210AG) in the F13A1
gene. The deletion occurred at the boundary between intron B and exon 3,
and appeared to cause a frameshift and premature protein truncation. The
last nucleotide of the preceding exon is G. The deletion converts GAG
(glu) to GTT (val) with the addition of only one other amino acid before
the stop codon since the coding region of the gene has 2,196 bases for
its 732 amino acids. Heterozygosity of the defect was documented in the
patient's offspring. The patient had a bleeding tendency since birth and
developed intracranial bleeding at age 27 years.

.0002
FACTOR XIII, A SUBUNIT, DEFICIENCY OF
F13A1, ARG681HIS

In a homozygous proband with factor XIII deficiency (613225) and in his
heterozygous parents, Board et al. (1992) identified a single G-to-A
transition in the last base of exon 14 of the F13A1 gene. The mutation
was predicted to result in an arg681-to-his (R681H) substitution.
However, because the mutation occurred at a splice junction, the
deficiency may be the consequence of a defect in pre-mRNA splicing.

.0003
FACTOR XIII, A SUBUNIT, DEFICIENCY OF
F13A1, ARG171TER

In a woman with factor XIII deficiency (613225), Standen and Bowen
(1993) identified a heterozygous 598C-T transition resulting in an
arg171-to-ter (R171X) substitution inherited from the father; the second
mutation was not identified. The patient, who was born in 1953, had a
history of profuse umbilical bleeding at birth and severe hemorrhage
after tonsillectomy and dental extractions in childhood. In adult life,
she had suffered recurrent muscle hematomas, retroperitoneal bleeding
and hemarthroses, and in 1988, had an intracranial hemorrhage which
responded to fresh frozen plasma. Two pregnancies terminated in
spontaneous abortion but 2 further pregnancies covered with fresh frozen
plasma resulted in live offspring. For 5 years she had received factor
XIII concentrate on a monthly basis and had remained well.

.0004
FACTOR XIII, A SUBUNIT, DEFICIENCY OF
F13A1, TYR441TER

In affected members of a family with FXIII deficiency (613225), Coggan
et al. (1995) identified 2 distinct mutations in the F13A1 gene, a
tyr441-to-ter (Y441X) substitution in exon 11 inherited through the
paternal line, and a asn60-to-lys (N60K; 134570.0005) substitution in
exon 3 inherited through the maternal line. The parents were not known
to be related and were of European descent. The parents and 1 sister
were thought to be heterozygous; 2 other sisters had severe bleeding
problems from the umbilicus at the time of birth and bleeding problems
later.

.0005
FACTOR XIII, A SUBUNIT, DEFICIENCY OF
F13A1, ASN60LYS

See 134570.0004, 134570.0006, and Coggan et al. (1995).

.0006
FACTOR XIII, A SUBUNIT, DEFICIENCY OF
F13A1, GLY501ARG

Castle et al. (1981) identified an unstable mutant form of the A subunit
of factor XIII in a family with FXIII deficiency (613225). This unstable
variant was called 'type 3' and found to result from a gly501-to-arg
(G501R) substitution in exon 12 of the F13A1 gene. The father had an
abnormal electrophoretic mobility of his plasma and platelet A subunits.
Although he had reduced factor XIII activity in the plasma, he was
clinically normal. Coggan et al. (1995) constructed asn60-to-lys
(134570.0005) mutations and gly501-to-arg mutations in cDNA clones and
expressed them in yeast. Although mRNA could be detected, protein
containing the asn60-to-lys substitution could not be detected, which
suggested the mutant protein was either extremely unstable or
susceptible to proteolysis. On the other hand, A subunits containing the
gly501-to-arg substitution were found to be enzymatically active in
fresh yeast lysates. However, the G501R variant was thermally
instability and lost activity during storage or purification. The data
were interpreted by Coggan et al. (1995) as indicating that the
gly501-to-arg mutation (type 3 variant) would cause severe factor XIII
deficiency if inherited in the homozygous form or as a compound
heterozygote with another deleterious mutation.

.0007
FACTOR XIII, A SUBUNIT, DEFICIENCY OF
F13A1, GLY562ARG

In a patient with factor XIII deficiency (613225), Takahashi et al.
(1998) found a homozygous G-to-A transition in the F13A1 gene, resulting
in a gly562-to-arg (G562R) substitution. Molecular modeling predicted an
altered conformation, and pulse-chase experiments demonstrated rapid
degradation of the protein.

.0008
FACTOR XIII, A SUBUNIT, DEFICIENCY OF
F13A1, VAL414PHE

In a 20-year-old woman of Indian descent with factor XIII deficiency
(613225), Kangsadalampai et al. (1999) found a homozygous 1240G-T
transversion in exon 10 of the F13A1 gene, resulting in a val414-to-phe
(V414F) substitution in the core domain of the enzyme. Expression of the
mutation in yeast revealed a dramatic reduction in the catalytic
activity and level of enzyme expressed. The patient presented with
severe retroperitoneal bleeding after an aerobics class. She had no
prior history of a significant bleeding disorder.

.0009
FACTOR XIII, A SUBUNIT, DEFICIENCY OF
F13A1, ARG260HIS

In a consanguineous family of Syrian descent with factor XIII deficiency
(613225), Kangsadalampai et al. (1999) identified a homozygous 779G-A
transition at in exon 6 of the F13A1 gene, resulting in an arg260-to-his
(R260H) substitution within the core domain of the enzyme. Functional
expression studies in yeast showed that the mutation resulted in
dramatically reduced catalytic activity and level of enzyme expression.
The proband was diagnosed at age 17 months. He had a history of oozing
from the umbilical cord, life-threatening retroperitoneal bleeding after
urologic surgery, and a large extradural hematoma after head injury.
Treatment with fresh frozen plasma and factor XIII concentrate resulted
in no further bleeding episodes.

.0010
MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, PROTECTION AGAINST
VENOUS THROMBOSIS, PROTECTION AGAINST, INCLUDED
F13A1, VAL34LEU

In Finnish individuals, Mikkola et al. (1994) identified a G-to-T
transition in exon 2 of the F13A1 gene that results in a val34-to-leu
(V34L) substitution. The variant was present in 23% of controls,
suggesting that it represents a common polymorphism. The amino acid
substitution was located close to a thrombin activation site (Kohler et
al., 1998; Catto et al., 1998).

Among 398 Caucasian patients investigated for coronary artery disease,
Kohler et al. (1998) found that the prevalence of the V34L polymorphism
was decreased in patients with myocardial infarction (608446) compared
to those without (32% vs 50%; p = 0.0009) and was also lower than in 196
controls (32% vs 48%; p = 0.005). The findings suggested a protective
effect of the leu34 allele against myocardial infarction.

Franco et al. (1999) presented evidence that the homozygous state for
the V34L mutation is a strong protective factor against venous
thrombosis (see 188050) in a study of 189 patients with deep venous
thrombosis and 187 controls. V34L was detected in 38.6% of the patients
and in 41.2% of controls. Homozygosity for leu34 was found in 1.6% of
the patients and in 9.6% of the controls, yielding an odds ratio (OR)
for venous thrombosis of 0.16. The OR for heterozygotes was 1.1.

By in vitro studies Ariens et al. (2000) found that the val34-to-leu
substitution increased the rate of factor XIIIA activation by thrombin
and resulted in abnormal fibrin clot structure. Clots formed by leu34
had thinner fibrin fibers and reduced mass/length ratio of the fibers,
as well as a finer meshwork and decreased permeation characteristics
compared to clots formed by val34. Lateral aggregation of fibrin fibers
was impaired by leu34.

In a study of the V34L polymorphism in 531 very low birth weight infants
(birth weight less than 1,500 g) and 301 control infants born at term,
Gopel et al. (2002) found no difference in allele frequencies between
the 2 groups. Very low birth weight infants who were heterozygous or
homozygous for the L34 allele had a significantly reduced risk for white
matter disorders than infants without the polymorphism (3.6% vs 10.4%, p
= 0.003) but had a moderately increased risk for subsequent isolated
ventricular hemorrhage (14.3% vs 10.1%, p = 0.17).

Reiner et al. (2003) hypothesized that possession of the V34L
polymorphism might modulate the prothrombotic effects of estrogen and
help explain the variation in incidence of arterial thrombotic events
among postmenopausal women using hormone replacement therapy. In a
population-based case-control study of 955 postmenopausal women, they
assessed the associations of factor XIII genotypes and their
interactions with estrogen therapy on risk of nonfatal myocardial
infarction (MI). The presence of the leu34 allele was associated with a
reduced risk of MI (OR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.51-0.95).

In a meta-analysis of 12 articles evaluating the affect of the V34L
variant on the risk of myocardial infarction, including 3,663 patients
and 5,080 controls, Shafey et al. (2007) found that the val34-to-leu
variant conferred a protective effect. Compared to the val/val genotype,
val/leu heterozygotes had an odds ratio of 0.79 (p = 0.008), and leu/leu
homozygotes had an odds ratio of 0.83 (p = 0.03). Under a different
statistical analysis, the leu/leu genotype was not significant, likely
due to low frequency.

.0011
FACTOR XIII, A SUBUNIT, DEFICIENCY OF
F13A1, ARG326GLN

Mikkola et al. (1996) described a G-to-A transition in exon 8 of the
F13A1 gene, resulting in an arg326-to-gln (R326Q) substitution and
resulting in factor XIIIA deficiency (613225). In 2 Dutch patients with
the disorder, Gomez Garcia et al. (2001) described the R326Q mutation in
compound heterozygosity in 1 case with a 2-bp insertion and in the other
case with a val316-to-phe missense mutation in exon 7 (V316F;
134570.0012).

.0012

F13A1, VAL316PHE

See 134570.0011 and Gomez Garcia et al. (2001).

.0013
FACTOR XIII, A SUBUNIT, DEFICIENCY OF
F13A1, TYR283CYS

In an Italian man with severe factor XIII deficiency (613225), Souri et
al. (2001) found heterozygosity for a tyr283-to-cys (Y283C) substitution
in exon 7 of the F13A1 gene. Molecular modeling predicted that the
mutant protein had impaired folding and dimer formation. A second
mutation was not identified. The patient developed a post-traumatic
hematoma in the right buttock at age 9 years that required surgical
drainage. A large hematoma of the right thigh developed at age 16 years,
requiring repeated surgical drainage and transfusion of packed red cells
and plasma several times. Plasma studies showed less than 2% of normal
plasma transamidase activity, and less than 5% and 38% of normal XIIIA
and XIIIB antigens, respectively. His brother also developed severe
bleeding after post-traumatic splenectomy at age 21 years. His plasma
had less than 2% of normal transamidase activity, and less than 5% and
41% of normal XIIIA and XIIIB antigen levels respectively. Their
parents, who were not related, were deceased.

.0014
FACTOR XIII, A SUBUNIT, DEFICIENCY OF
F13A1, 1-BP INS, 1286C

A homozygous 1-bp insertion (1286insC) in exon 9 of the F13A1 gene was
described 3 affected individuals from a Greek family reported by Aslam
et al. (1998) and in a Turkish family reported by Birben et al. (2002).
All affected individuals had factor XIII deficiency (613225). The
insertion resulted in the creation of a stop codon at amino acid
position 403. The patient of Birben et al. (2002), the child of a
first-cousin marriage, was a 5-year-old girl who had bled from the
umbilical cord at birth and experienced recurrent musculoskeletal
hematomas. Three sibs with a history of prolonged umbilical cord
bleeding at birth had died in infancy.

.0015
FACTOR XIII, A SUBUNIT, DEFICIENCY OF
F13A1, IVS5AS, G-A, -1

In a 13-year-old boy of Canadian origin with factor XIII deficiency
(613225), Anwar and Langlois (2009) identified compound heterozygosity
for 2 mutations in the F13A1 gene: a G-to-A transition in intron 5 and a
C-to-T transition in exon 15 resulting in an arg703-to-trp substitution
(R703W; 134570.0016) substitution. The patient was diagnosed with factor
XIII deficiency at the age of 8 months. He had a typical presentation of
umbilical bleeding shortly after birth. FXIII assessment indicated a
complete lack of plasma FXIIIA and reduced levels of plasma FXIIIB;
FXIIIB levels are commonly reduced in FXIIIA deficiency, probably due to
redundancy in its role as a carrier protein for FXIIIA. The splicing
mutation resulted in 2 abnormal transcripts: 1 lacked the first seven
bases of exon 6 causing a frameshift and premature termination within
exon 6, and the second lacked all of exon 5 in addition to the first 7
bases of exon 6, causing an in-frame deletion of 42 amino acids. The
R703W mutation was predicted to result in an unstable protein. R703W was
not present in 118 normal chromosomes. The splice site mutation was
inherited from the father, whereas the R703W mutation appeared to be a
de novo event.

.0017
FACTOR XIII, A SUBUNIT, DEFICIENCY OF
F13A1, ARG661TER

In affected members of 6 of 8 Finnish families with factor XIII
deficiency (613225), Mikkola et al. (1994) identified a C-to-T
transition in exon 14 of the F13A1 gene, resulting in an arg661-to-ter
(R661X) substitution. Six patients from 4 families were homozygous for
the R661X mutation, and 3 patients from 2 additional families were
compound heterozygous for R661X and another mutation, including 1
patient with a T-to-C transition in exon 6, resulting in a met242-to-thr
(M242T; 134570.0018) substitution. Thus, the R661X mutation accounted
for 62.5% of all the mutant alleles in this population, suggesting a
founder effect. The mutation was not identified in 600 controls.

FACTOR XIII, A SUBUNIT, DEFICIENCY OF
F13A1, 4-BP DEL, 602AAAG

In affected members of a Chinese family with factor XIII deficiency
(613225), Wang et al. (2011) identified compound heterozygosity for 2
mutations in the F13A1 gene: a 4-bp deletion (602delAAAG) in exon 5
resulting in a truncated protein of 204 residues, and a C-to-A
transversion in intron 1 (134570.0020). In vitro studies showed that the
C-to-A transversion eliminated a binding site for the transcription
factor Sp1 (189906), resulting in decreased transcription of the F13A1
gene. The findings demonstrated a novel regulatory mechanism involving
intron 1 in the F13A1 gene.

F13A1, IVS1, C-A, +12 (dbSNP rs2815822)

Wang et al. (2011) demonstrated that a C-to-A transversion in intron 1
of the F13A1 gene eliminated a binding site for the transcription factor
Sp1 (189906), resulting in decreased transcription of the F13A1 gene.

Shinozawa (2011) stated that the IVS1+12C-A change is a polymorphism
(dbSNP rs2815822) with a population diversity ratio in Africans and
Europeans of 0.9:0.1 (C allele:A allele). In Asians, the frequency of
the minor A allele is less than 0.05. Since the translation initiation
codon is in exon 2 of the F13A1 gene, this SNP is equivalent to a
promoter variant in the 5-prime flanking region.

605166	TITLE *605166 HISTONE DEACETYLASE 3; HDAC3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Acetylation and deacetylation of histone proteins alters chromosome
structure and affects transcription factor access to DNA. See HDAC1
(601241) for more information on histone deacetylases.

CLONING

Yang et al. (1997) identified HDAC3 by screening an EST database for
sequences with homology to HDAC1 and HDAC2 (605164). They isolated an
HDAC3 cDNA from a human fibroblast cDNA library. HDAC3 has an open
reading frame of 428 amino acids. HDAC3 shares 53% amino acid identity
with HDAC1 and 52% with HDAC2. A FLAG-tagged HDAC3 fusion protein showed
histone deacetylase activity on chicken histones. A Gal4-HDAC3 fusion
protein repressed transcription from a Gal4 binding site-containing
target gene. Transcriptional repression by Gal4-HDAC3 was dependent upon
the presence of Gal4 binding sites. A GST-HDAC3 fusion protein
specifically bound labeled YY1 (600013) in vitro, similar to HDAC2.
Northern blot analysis identified HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 transcripts in
all human tissues and tumor cell lines examined.

Dangond et al. (1998) used mRNA differential display and 5-prime RACE to
identify and isolate an HDAC3 cDNA from PHA-activated T cells. Immune
activation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells by PHA, PMA, and
alpha-CD3 increased HDAC3 mRNA levels in these cells. In the human
myeloid leukemia cell line THP-1, HDAC3 transfection resulted in
accumulation of cells at G2/M phase, aberrant nuclear morphology, and
increase in cell size.

Emiliani et al. (1998) identified HDAC3 from an EST database. Using
specific polyclonal antiserum recognizing the C-terminal domain of
HDAC3, they showed by Western blot analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic
cell fractions that the approximately 49-kD HDAC3 protein is localized
to the nucleus.

GENE FUNCTION

Chen et al. (2001) showed that RELA (164014) is a nonhistone substrate
of HDAC3 and that IKBA (164008)-dependent nuclear export of the
HDAC3-deacetylated RELA replenishes the depleted cytoplasmic pool of
latent NFKB-IKBA complexes for subsequent NFKB responses (see 164011).

Fischle et al. (2002) showed that the catalytic domain of HDAC4 (605314)
interacts with HDAC3 via the transcriptional corepressor NCOR2 (600848).
All experimental conditions leading to the suppression of HDAC4 binding
to NCOR2 and to HDAC3 resulted in loss of enzymatic activity associated
with HDAC4. These observations indicated that class II HDACs regulate
transcription by bridging the enzymatically active NCOR2-HDAC3 complex
and select transcription factors.

Baek et al. (2002) demonstrated that interleukin-1-beta (IL1B; 147720)
causes nuclear export of a specific NCOR (600849) corepressor complex,
resulting in derepression of a specific subset of NFKB-regulated genes.
These genes are exemplified by the tetraspanin KAI1 (600623), which
regulates membrane receptor function. Nuclear export of the NCOR/TAB2
(605101)/HDAC3 complex by IL1B is temporally linked to selective
recruitment of a TIP60 (601409) coactivator complex. KAI1 is also
directly activated by a ternary complex, dependent on the
acetyltransferase activity of TIP60, that consists of the
presenilin-dependent C-terminal cleavage product of the beta amyloid
precursor protein (APP; 104760), FE65 (602709), and TIP60, identifying a
specific in vivo gene target of an APP-dependent transcription complex
in the brain.

Zhang et al. (2002) reported that GPS2 (601935), a protein involved in
intracellular signaling, is an integral subunit of the NCOR1 NCOR1-HDAC3
complex. They determined structural motifs that direct the formation of
a highly stable and active deacetylase complex. GPS2 and TBL1 (300196),
another component of the NCOR1-HDAC3 complex, interact cooperatively
with repression domain-1 of NCOR1 to form a heterotrimeric structure and
are indirectly linked to HDAC3 via an extended NCOR1 SANT domain that
also activates latent HDAC3 activity. Zhang et al. (2002) also showed
that the NCOR1-HDAC3 complex inhibits JNK (601158) activation through
the associated GPS2 subunit and thus could potentially provide an
alternative mechanism for hormone-mediated antagonism of AP1 (165160)
function.

Fajas et al. (2002) found that Pparg (601487) promoted adipocyte
differentiation more efficiently in Rb1 (614041)-deficient mouse
embryonic fibroblasts than in Rb1-expressing controls. Pparg and Rb1
coimmunoprecipitated, and the Pparg-Rb1 complex also contained Hdac3.
Rb1 recruited Hdac3 to the Pparg-Rb1 complex, and recruitment attenuated
Pparg-mediated gene expression and adipocyte differentiation.
Dissociation of the Pparg-Rb1-Hdac3 complex by Rb1 phosphorylation or
inhibition of Hdac activity stimulated adipocyte differentiation.

Zhang et al. (2005) found that in HeLa cells HDAC3 was activated by the
phosphorylation of ser424 by casein kinase II (see CSNK2A1; 115440) and
was deactivated by dephosphorylation of ser424 by protein phosphatase-4
(see PPP4C; 602035). HDAC3 copurified with PPP4C and its regulatory
subunit, PPP4R1 (604908), in an HDAC3 complex that showed phosphatase
activity. Both protein phosphatase-4 subunits interacted directly with
HDAC3, and mutation analysis indicated that the N terminus of HDAC3 was
necessary and sufficient for HDAC3-PPP4C interaction. Both
overexpression and RNA interference experiments indicated that HDAC3
activity was inversely proportional to the cellular abundance of PPP4C.

The PML (102578)-RARA (180240) fusion gene product induces a block on
hematopoietic differentiation and acute promyelocytic leukemia by
inactivating target genes via its ability to recruit histone
deacetylases and DNA methyltransferases. Villa et al. (2006) found that
MBD1 (156535) cooperated with PML-RARA in transcriptional repression and
cellular transformation in human cell lines. PML-RARA recruited MBD1 to
its target promoter through an HDAC3-mediated mechanism. Binding of
HDAC3 and MBD1 was not confined to the target promoter, but was instead
spread over the locus. Knockdown of HDAC3 expression by RNA interference
in acute promyelocytic leukemia cells alleviated PML-RARA-induced
promoter silencing. Furthermore, retroviral expression of
dominant-negative mutants of MBD1 in human hematopoietic precursors
interfered with PML-RARA-induced repression and restored cell
differentiation. Villa et al. (2006) concluded that PML-RARA recruits an
HDAC3-MBD1 complex to target promoters to establish and maintain
chromatin silencing.

Bhaskara et al. (2008) stated that deletion of the Hdac3 gene in mice
causes early embryonic lethality. They found that conditional deletion
of the Hdac3 gene in mouse embryonic fibroblasts led to a delay in cell
cycle progression, cell cycle-dependent DNA damage, and apoptosis. While
no overt defects in mitosis were observed, DNA damage was apparent in
interphase cells and appeared to be associated with defective DNA
double-strand break repair.

Ishii et al. (2008) found that the HDAC3 complex, including NCOR, TBL1,
and TBLR1 (TBL1XR1; 608628), localized to mitotic spindles in HeLa
cells. Knockdown of HDAC3 or NCOR resulted in collapsed mitotic spindles
that were surrounded by chromosomes arranged in a dome-like
configuration. Treatment of mitotic cells with an HDAC inhibitor
resulted in similar spindle defects independent of transcriptional
regulation. Wildtype HDAC3 but not a deacetylase-dead mutant HDAC3
rescued the the phenotype of HDAC3-depleted cells. Whereas the
kinetochores and spindle assembly checkpoint appeared intact in
HDAC3-deficient cells, kinetochore-microtubule attachments were impaired
because spindle microtubules were unstable in response to cold
treatment. Ishii et al. (2008) concluded that the HDAC3 complex is
involved in the formation of functional mitotic spindles and
kinetochore-microtubule attachment.

Feng et al. (2011) showed that HDAC3 recruitment to the genome displays
a circadian rhythm in mouse liver. Histone acetylation is inversely
related to HDAC3 binding, and this rhythm is lost when HDAC3 is absent.
Although amounts of HDAC3 are constant, its genomic recruitment in liver
corresponds to the expression pattern of the circadian nuclear receptor
Rev-erb-alpha (602408). Rev-erb-alpha colocalizes with HDAC3 near genes
regulating lipid metabolism, and deletion of HDAC3 or Rev-erb-alpha in
mouse liver causes hepatic steatosis. Thus, Feng et al. (2011) concluded
that genomic recruitment of HDAC3 by Rev-erb-alpha directs a circadian
rhythm of histone acetylation and gene expression required for normal
hepatic lipid homeostasis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Mahlknecht et al. (1999) isolated a genomic clone of human HDAC3. HDAC3
is a single-copy gene spanning at least 13 kb, with 15 exons interrupted
by 14 introns.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Watson et al. (2012) reported the structure of a complex between an
HDAC, HDAC3, and a corepressor, NCOR2 (600848). The structure revealed 2
remarkable features. First, the SMRT-deacetylase activation domain (DAD)
undergoes a large structural rearrangement on forming the complex.
Second, there is an essential inositol tetraphosphate molecule,
D-myo-inositol-(1,4,5,6)-tetrakisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5,6)P4), acting as
an 'intermolecular glue' between the 2 proteins. Assembly of the complex
is clearly dependent on the Ins(1,4,5,6)P4, which may act as a
regulator, potentially explaining why inositol phosphates and their
kinases have been found to act as transcriptional regulators. This
mechanism for the activation of HDAC3 appears to be conserved in class I
HDACs from yeast to humans, and the authors suggested it opens the way
to novel therapeutic opportunities.

MAPPING

By FISH analysis, Mahlknecht et al. (1999) mapped the HDAC3 gene to
chromosome 5q31.3. Using FISH, Randhawa et al. (1998) also mapped the
HDAC3 gene to 5q31, a region of the genome implicated in asthma
(600807), inherited deafness (124900), congenital leukemia, large-cell
lymphoma, and myelodysplastic syndrome.

ANIMAL MODEL

Alenghat et al. (2008) created a knockin mouse model in which a missense
mutation, Y478A, was introduced into the Ncor1 deacetylase activation
domain (DAD). This created a mutant protein that was stable but unable
to associate with or activate Hdac3. The DADm mice were viable, born at
normal mendelian frequencies, and morphologically indistinguishable from
wildtype littermates at birth. Thus, Ncor1 binding to Hdac3 is not
required for normal development, and the embryonic defects of mice
lacking Ncor1 are due to factors other than, or in addition to, Hdac3
recruitment by Ncor1. However, the DADm mice had aberrant regulation of
clock genes and had abnormal circadian behavior. These mice were leaner
and more insulin sensitive owing to increased energy expenditure.
Unexpectedly, loss of a functional Ncor1-Hdac3 complex in vivo did not
lead to sustained increases in known catabolic genes, but instead
significantly altered the oscillatory patterns of several metabolic
genes, demonstrating that circadian regulation of metabolism is critical
for normal energy balance. Alenghat et al. (2008) concluded that
activation of Hdac3 by Ncor1 is a nodal point in the epigenetic
regulation of circadian and metabolic physiology.

Sun et al. (2011) stated that cardiac-specific deletion of the Hdac3
gene at midgestation in mice results in severe hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy and lethality by the age of 4 months. They found that
cardiac- and muscle-specific deletion of the Hdac3 gene postnatally
permitted survival for over a year in mice fed a normal chow diet.
However, these mutant mice developed severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
and died of heart failure within weeks when switched to a high-fat diet.
Microarray analysis showed that Hdac3 knockout led to downregulation of
genes involved in mitochondrial bioenergetics and lipid metabolism and
upregulation of genes involved in immune responses. Sun et al. (2011)
concluded that diet-induced obesity and HDAC3 deficiency have additive
effects in causing a profound decrease in oxidative capacity of
myocardial mitochondria.

;;VCP/p47 COMPLEX-INTERACTING PROTEIN, 135-KD; VCIP135;;
KIAA1850
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult hippocampus
cDNA library, Nagase et al. (2001) cloned VCPIP1, which they designated
KIAA1850. The deduced protein contains 1,236 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected moderate VCPIP1 expression in all adult and fetal tissues
examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Reassembly of the Golgi apparatus from membrane fragments after cell
division requires the ATPases NSF (601633) and p97 (VCP; 601023), as
well as the cofactor p47 (NSFL1C; 606610) and the receptor syntaxin-5
(STX5A; 603189). Uchiyama et al. (2002) showed that rat Vcip135 was
essential for p97/p47-mediated membrane fusion and that Vcip135 bound to
the p97/p47/Stx5a complex and dissociated it via p97-catalyzed ATP
hydrolysis. Microinjection of antibodies against Vcip135 and p47 in rat
kidney cells showed that Vcip135 and p47 were required for Golgi and
endoplasmic reticulum assembly.

Wang et al. (2004) found that p97/p47-mediated reassembly of Golgi
cisternae required ubiquitin. They identified rat Vcip135 as a
deubiquitinating enzyme and found that it reversed the ubiquitination
event that occurred during mitotic disassembly. Wang et al. (2004)
concluded that a cycle of ubiquitination and VCIP135-mediated
deubiquitination regulates Golgi membrane dynamics during mitosis.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2001) mapped the VCPIP1
gene to chromosome 8.

;;DORA REVERSE STRAND; DREV
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Bates et al. (2000) identified ESTs containing sequences complementary
to the region 5-prime of the mouse and human IGSF6 genes (606222). The
deduced proteins, designated DREV (DORA reverse strand) proteins, show
weak homology to ribosomal RNA adenine dimethylases and contain
conserved consensus sequences for the recognition of nucleotide methyl
groups and possibly for methyl group transfer. Northern blot analysis of
mouse tissues detected ubiquitous and variable Drev expression.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bates et al. (2000) determined that the DREV gene contains 5 exons. The
5-prime UTR has a high GC content. Intron 4 of the DREV gene contains
the entire IGSF6 gene on the complementary strand, and there is a
retrotransposon-like sequence between the 3-prime end of the IGSF6 gene
and exon 4 of the DREV gene.

MAPPING

By FISH, Bates et al. (2000) mapped the mouse Drev gene to a region of
chromosome 7F2-F3 that shows homology of synteny with human chromosome
16p12-p11. Bates et al. (1998) had earlier mapped the human IGSF6 gene
to chromosome 16p13.

604237	TITLE *604237 CYTOKINE RECEPTOR-LIKE FACTOR 1; CRLF1
;;CLF1;;
NR6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The CRLF1 gene encodes cytokine receptor-like factor-1, a soluble
protein that is a member of the ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor
pathway. CRLF1 forms a complex with CLCF1 (607672), and this complex
binds to the ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor (CNTFR; 118946) to
induce downstream signaling events (Elson et al., 2000; summary by
Herholz et al., 2011).

CLONING

Elson et al. (1998) described the identification, cloning, and
expression pattern of human cytokine-like factor-1, which they
designated CLF1, as well as the identification and cloning of the mouse
homolog. They were identified from expressed sequence tags using amino
acid sequences from conserved regions of the cytokine type I receptor
family. The human and mouse CRLF1 proteins share 96% amino acid identity
and significant homology with many cytokine type I receptors. The human
cDNA encodes a precursor protein of 422 amino acids with a putative
signal peptide of 37 amino acids. CRLF1 is a secreted protein,
suggesting that it is either a soluble subunit within a cytokine
receptor complex, like the soluble form of IL6R (147880), or a subunit
of a multimeric cytokine, e.g., IL12B (161561). The highest levels of
CRLF1 mRNA were observed in lymph node, spleen, thymus, appendix,
placenta, stomach, and fetal lung, with constitutive expression of CRLF1
mRNA detected in a human kidney fibroblast cell line.

Using an oligonucleotide encoding the conserved WSXWS (single-letter
amino acid code) motif present in the extracellular domains of
hemopoietin receptors, Alexander et al. (1999) isolated a Crlf1 cDNA,
which they called Nr6, from mouse testis, brain, and KUSA cell line cDNA
libraries. Most of the clones contained a long open reading frame
(Nr6.1) of 1,275 nucleotides. The predicted protein sequence is
consistent with that of a hemopoietin receptor: a potential signal
sequence and immunoglobulin-like domain precedes a hemopoietin domain
containing the expected cysteine pairs and a WSEWS motif, and a sequence
with loose homology to part of the fibronectin type III repeat is
evident at the C terminus. Independent clones were also isolated with
deduced open reading frames (Nr6.2 and Nr6.3) that contain divergent
sequences C-terminal to the hemopoietin domain. Human NR6 cDNAs, all of
which were homologs of murine Nr6.1, were isolated using low-stringency
hybridization of murine probes to fetal kidney, fetal liver, and
placenta libraries. No hydrophobic sequences typical of a transmembrane
domain and no motifs usually required for membrane association via lipid
attachment were evident, indicating that NR6 is a soluble member of the
hemopoietin receptor family. The primary amino acid sequences of human
and mouse NR6.1 are 98% identical. Although NR6 was found to have
sequence similarity to membrane-bound hemopoietin receptors,
structurally it appeared to be analogous to the 2 other exclusively
soluble members of the hemopoietin receptor family, the p40 component of
IL12 (IL12B) and EBI3 (605816), a 34-kD glycoprotein secreted by B
lymphocytes in response to Epstein-Barr virus.

MAPPING

Elson et al. (1998) found the CRLF1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AC003112)
within a 14-kb region of a chromosome 19-specific cosmid mapping to
19p12.

GENE FUNCTION

In fibroblast primary cell cultures, Elson et al. (1998) found that
CRLF1 mRNA was upregulated by TNF-alpha (191160), interleukin-6
(147620), and gamma-interferon (147570). Western blot analysis of
recombinant forms of CRLF1 showed that the protein has the tendency to
form covalently linked dimers and tetramers. These results suggested
that CRLF1 is a novel soluble cytokine receptor subunit or part of a
novel cytokine complex, possibly playing a regulatory role in the immune
system and during fetal development.

CRLF1 competes with ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF; 118945) for
binding to the ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor (CNTFR; 118946)
complex (Elson et al., 2000). The binding of CRLF1 and CNTF to a common
receptor, and their apparent functional similarity, led Lesser and Lo
(2000) to dub CRLF1 'CNTF II.' CNTF exerts a survival-promoting effect
on a variety of neuronal cells. However, the use of CNTF as an
experimental treatment of patients with motor-neuron disease did not
influence the clinical course of the disorder (Lambert et al., 2001).
Furthermore, a null mutation in the CNTF gene occurs as a common variant
in the Japanese population and is not associated with a neurologic
disorder (Takahashi et al., 1994).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Cold-induced sweating syndrome (CISS1; 272430) was first described in 2
Israeli sisters in a consanguineous family who experienced profuse
sweating, induced by cool surroundings, on large segments of their back
and chest. They had additional abnormalities, including a high-arched
palate, nasal voice, depressed nasal bridge, inability to fully extend
their elbows, and kyphoscoliosis, none of which were found in the
parents. Knappskog et al. (2003) observed a similar clinical phenotype
in 2 Norwegian brothers with remote common ancestors. By homozygosity
mapping, they demonstrated a candidate region on chromosome 19p12. DNA
sequencing of 25 genes within the critical region identified potentially
deleterious CRLF1 sequence variants that were not found in unaffected
control individuals; see 604237.0001-604237.0002.

CNTFR is expressed primarily in the nervous system, but expression is
also detected in skeletal muscle. A muscle biopsy performed during back
surgery in 1 of the Norwegian brothers reported by Knappskog et al.
(2003) showed atrophic skeletal muscle, possibly contributing to his
development of severe kyphoscoliosis. The clinical observations in the
Norwegian brothers (see 604237.0001) showed similarities to observations
made in experimental animals and in cell cultures.

In 4 children from 3 unrelated families with Crisponi syndrome, a rare
autosomal recessive disorder characterized by congenital contractions of
facial muscles, dysmorphic features, and hyperthermia, Dagoneau et al.
(2007) identified homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the
CRLF1 gene (604237.0003-604237.0006). The 4 mutations were located in
the immunoglobulin-like and type III fibronectin domains, and 3 of them
predicted premature termination of translation. Using real-time
quantitative PCR, Dagoneau et al. (2007) found a significant decrease in
CRLF1 mRNA expression in patient fibroblasts, which was suggestive of a
mutation-mediated decay of the abnormal transcript. CRLF1 forms a
heterodimeric complex with cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor-1 (CLCF1;
607672), which is the site of mutations causing cold-induced sweating
syndrome-2 (CISS2; 610313), and this heterodimer competes with ciliary
neurotrophic factor (CNTF; 118945) for binding to the ciliary
neurotrophic factor receptor (CNTFR; 118946) complex. The identification
of CRLF1 mutations in Crisponi syndrome supported the key role of the
CNTFR pathway in the function of the autonomic nervous system.

Within the critical region identified on chromosome 19p13.1-p12 for
Crisponi syndrome, Crisponi et al. (2007) identified the CRLF1 gene as
the most prominent candidate and detected 4 different CRLF1 mutations in
8 families, including a missense mutation, a single-nucleotide
insertion, a nonsense mutation, and an insertion/deletion (indel)
mutation. Crisponi et al. (2007) noted that the CRLF1 gene is involved
in the pathogenesis of cold-induced sweating syndrome-1, which belongs
to a group of conditions with overlapping phenotypes also including
cold-induced sweating syndrome-2 and Stuve-Wiedemann syndrome (601559).
All of these syndromes are caused by mutations of genes in the ciliary
neurotrophic factor receptor pathway. Comparison of the mutation spectra
of Crisponi syndrome and CISS1 suggested that neither the type nor the
location of the CRLF1 mutations points to a phenotype/genotype
correlation that would account for the most severe phenotype in Crisponi
syndrome. Crisponi et al. (2007) suggested that the syndromes mentioned
comprise a family of 'CNTF receptor-related disorders.'

Herholz et al. (2011) noted that most older patients with CISS have a
history of features consistent with Crisponi syndrome early in life.
Based on functional studies of the mutations in the CRLF1 gene causing
the 2 disorders, Herholz et al. (2011) concluded that Crisponi syndrome
and CISS1 represent manifestations of the same disorder, with different
degrees of severity.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Herholz et al. (2011) performed in vitro functional analysis of 13
different CRLF1 mutations by cotransfecting mutant CRLF1 with wildtype
CLCF1 in COS-7 cells. CRLF1 mutants K368X (604237.0007), W284C, R81H and
L374R (604237.0002) were strongly detected in the supernatant of
transfected cells, at levels of 40% or more. Mutants W76G (604237.0004),
676insA (604237.0003), 708delCCinsT (604237.0008), and 844delGT
(604237.0001) were partially secreted (6-28%), and mutants Y75D, 713dupC
(604237.0006), 538insA, and Q180X were not secreted or detected at all.
There was some correlation between phenotypic severity and levels of
CRLF1 secretion: absent or weak secretion was associated with a more
severe phenotype and strong secretion was associated with a milder
phenotype. Time lapse secretion studies indicated that coexpression with
CRLF1 is not necessary for CLCF1 secretion, but is required to
accelerate the kinetics of secretion into the extracellular medium.
CLCF1 alone could induce STAT3 (102582) phosphorylation in a cell line,
but CRLF1 alone could not. However, the complexes of wildtype CLCF1 and
mutant forms of CRLF1 were able to elicit STAT3 signaling.

ANIMAL MODEL

In the developing mouse embryo, CRLF1 is expressed at multiple sites,
including skeletal muscle. Alexander et al. (1999) found that mice
lacking the CRLF1 gene were unable to suckle and died of starvation
shortly after birth, with their stomachs devoid of milk. No anatomic
anomalies of the mouth were detected and the mechanism of the suckling
problem was unclear. Newborn mice lacking CNTFR are also unable to feed,
and impaired jaw movements have been observed.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
COLD-INDUCED SWEATING SYNDROME 1
CRLF1, 2-BP DEL, 844GT

In 2 Norwegian brothers with cold-induced sweating syndrome-1 (272430),
Knappskog et al. (2003) identified homozygosity for a 2-bp deletion
(844GT) in exon 5 of the CRLF1 gene, which was predicted to result in a
frameshift encoding a nonfunctional gene product. The disorder in the
Norwegian brothers was more severe than that in the Israeli sisters (see
604237.0002), with earlier age of onset, feeding difficulties, serious
kyphoscoliosis, and reduced pain and temperature sensitivity. The older
brother would not suckle in the neonatal period, leading to dehydration.
He was fed first by a nasogastric tube and subsequently by a special
sucking device intended for newborn lambs. These feeding problems,
complicated by bronchopulmonary and urinary tract infections, led to
hospitalization for his first 3 months of life. His younger brother was
admitted at 1 day of age, primarily because of respiratory problems. He
too did not suckle spontaneously and had to be fed in the same manner as
his older brother. Both had difficulty fully opening their mouths. While
playing in the snow, the older brother repeatedly experienced frostbite
in his hands. Furthermore, he could hold his palms in a flame or put his
hands in boiling water without any sensory pain. Both brothers had
severe progressive kyphoscoliosis requiring extensive surgery, following
which the boys had an unusually low requirement for pain-relieving
medication. Both brothers had short hands with pronounced clinodactyly
and tapering of fingers. They could not fully extend their elbows. Their
sweating problem was noted at the age of approximately 7 years. The
patchwise distribution in affected areas closely resembled those
described in the Israeli sisters. These areas did not sweat at warm
temperatures, during fever episodes, or during exercise. The mother
sometimes had to cool her overheated children by putting their feet in
cold water. Subtropical environment did not bother these patients. They
could stay in bright sunlight without feeling the heat and had no desire
to take their clothes off for cooling.

COLD-INDUCED SWEATING SYNDROME 1
CRLF1, ARG81HIS AND LEU374ARG

In 2 Israeli sisters in whom cold-induced sweating syndrome-1 (272430)
was first delineated, Knappskog et al. (2003) found homozygosity for 2
mutations in the CRLF1 gene: an A-to-G transition in the second position
of codon 81, predicting a change from arginine to histidine (R81H); and
a T-to-G transversion in the second position of codon 374, predicting a
change from leucine to arginine (L374R).

.0003
COLD-INDUCED SWEATING SYNDROME 1
CRLF1, 1-BP INS, 676A

In a Sardinian family with Crisponi syndrome (272430), Dagoneau et al.
(2007) found compound heterozygosity for duplication of an adenine
nucleotide at position 676 in exon 4 of the CRLF1 gene (676dupA), and a
missense mutation in exon 2 (W76G; 604237.0004). As noted by Crisponi et
al. (2007), who also studied this family and detected these mutations,
this was one of the original families described by Crisponi (1996).
Crisponi et al. (2007) referred to the mutation in exon 4 as
676-677insA. The mutation results in a threonine-to-asparagine
substitution at codon 226 followed by frameshift, which leads to the
deletion of a complete fibronectin domain as well as the C-terminal
domain (T226NfsX104). Crisponi et al. (2007) also found the 676-677insA
mutation in compound heterozygosity with the W76G mutation in another
family (also studied by Crisponi (1996)), and in homozygosity in 2
further families. All of these families were Sardinian, suggesting a
potential founder effect.

.0004
COLD-INDUCED SWEATING SYNDROME 1
CRLF1, TRP76GLY

The Sardinian patient with Crisponi syndrome (272430) studied by
Dagoneau et al. (2007) was compound heterozygous for a substitution of
glycine for tryptophan at codon 76 (W76G) of the CRLF1 gene, caused by a
226T-G transversion in exon 2, and a 1-bp insertion (604237.0003). This
patient was also studied by Crisponi et al. (2007) and Crisponi (1996).
Crisponi et al. (2007) noted that this substitution occurs in the
immunoglobulin-like domain of the protein and was predicted to result in
loss of tight internal side-chain arrangement and consequent decrease of
stability. Trp76 is strictly conserved within CRLF1 homologous proteins
from zebrafish to human. Crisponi et al. (2007) found this mutation in
compound heterozygosity with the 1-bp insertion in a second Sardinian
family (also described by Crisponi (1996)) and in homozygosity in an
additional Sardinian proband who displayed a severe phenotype.

.0005
COLD-INDUCED SWEATING SYNDROME 1
CRLF1, 527+5G-A

Dagoneau et al. (2007) found this mutation in homozygosity in a Yemenite
patient with Crisponi syndrome (272430) who was the daughter of
first-cousin parents. She was first given a diagnosis of Schwartz-Jampel
syndrome type 2 (601559) since she presented with suggestive dysmorphic
features, pursed appearance of the mouth during crying, bilateral
camptodactyly, poor sucking, and swallowing difficulties, but she had no
bowing of the lower limbs.

.0006
COLD-INDUCED SWEATING SYNDROME 1
CRLF1, 1-BP DUP, 713C

Dagoneau et al. (2007) described a 1-bp duplication in exon 5 of the
CRLF1 gene, 713dupC, in homozygous state in 2 first cousins in a
consanguineous Gypsy family as the basis of Crisponi syndrome (272430).

.0007
COLD-INDUCED SWEATING SYNDROME 1
CRLF1, LYS368TER

In a Turkish child with Crisponi syndrome (272430), Crisponi et al.
(2007) found an A-to-T transversion at nucleotide 1102 in exon 7 of the
CRLF1 gene that resulted in substitution of a termination codon for
lys368 (K368X).

.0008
COLD-INDUCED SWEATING SYNDROME 1
CRLF1, 2-BP DEL/1-BP INS, NT708

In 3 children from 2 consanguineous Turkish families, Crisponi et al.
(2007) found that Crisponi syndrome (272430) was related to homozygosity
for an indel mutation in exon 5 of the CRLF1 gene: 708-709delCCinsT. The
mutation leads to a frameshift in the second fibronectin type II domain
(P238RfsX6). The fathers of the affected probands from these 2 families
originated from the same town in eastern Turkey.

.0009
COLD-INDUCED SWEATING SYNDROME 1
CRLF1, ARG277TER

In a Turkish patient with Crisponi syndrome (272430) who had the
additional features of velopharyngeal insufficiency, incomplete cleft
palate, and thin corpus callosum, Okur et al. (2008) identified a
homozygous 829C-T transition in the CRLF1 gene, resulting in an
arg277-to-ter (R277X) substitution. Both parents were heterozygous for
the mutation.

601143	TITLE *601143 DYNACTIN 1; DCTN1
;;p150(GLUED), DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cytoplasmic dynein is a microtubule-based biologic motor protein.
Holzbaur and Tokito (1996) noted that dyneins were initially discovered
as enzymes that couple ATP hydrolysis to provide a force for cellular
motility in eukaryotic cilia and flagella. A distinct cytoplasmic form
of dynein (600112) was subsequently characterized and thought to be
responsible for the intracellular retrograde motility of vesicles and
organelles along microtubules (Holzbaur and Vallee, 1994). A large
macromolecular complex, dynactin, is required for the cytoplasmic
dynein-driven movement of organelles along microtubules. Dynactin is
composed of 10 distinct polypeptides of 150, 135, 62, 50 (DCTN2;
607376), 45, 42, 37, 32, 27, and 24 kD, with a combined mass of 10
million daltons. The largest polypeptide of the dynactin complex,
p150(Glued), binds directly to microtubules and to cytoplasmic dynein.
The binding of dynactin to dynein is critical for neuronal function, as
antibodies that specifically disrupt this binding block vesicle motility
along microtubules in extruded squid axoplasm. Holzbaur and Tokito
(1996) stated that the dynein-dynactin interaction is probably a key
component of the mechanism of axonal transport of vesicles and
organelles. Further evidence for a critical role for dynactin in vivo
comes from the analysis of mutations in the homologous gene in
Drosophila. Mutant alleles of the 'glued' gene induced disruption of the
neurons of the optic lobe and compound eye in heterozygotes; null
mutations are lethal.

CLONING

Holzbaur and Tokito (1996) isolated and characterized cDNA clones
encoding human p150(Glued), as well as alternatively spliced isoforms.
Using these to isolate genomic clones, they found by genomic Southern
blots that there is a single gene in the human, as had previously been
observed in rat and chick.

Jang et al. (1997) cloned and characterized mouse Dctn1. The mouse
protein shares 95% amino acid identity with the human protein. The
authors found no abnormalities of the gene in mnd2 mice.

GENE FUNCTION

Eaton et al. (2002) disrupted the dynactin complex in Drosophila, using
3 separate perturbations: dsRNA interference with arp1 (homolog of
ACTR1A; 605143), mutation in p150/Glued, and a dominant-negative Glued
transgene. In all 3 cases, the disruption resulted in an increase in the
frequency and extent of synaptic retraction events at the neuromuscular
junction. Eaton et al. (2002) concluded that dynactin functions locally
within the presynaptic arbor to promote synapse stability at the
neuromuscular junction.

Kim et al. (2004) showed that BBS4 (600374) protein localizes to the
centriolar satellites of centrosomes and basal bodies of primary cilia,
where it functions as an adaptor of the p150(glued) subunit of the
dynein transport machinery to recruit pericentriolar material-1 protein
(PCM1; 600299) and its associated cargo to the satellites. Silencing of
BBS4 induces PCM1 mislocalization and concomitant deanchoring of
centrosomal microtubules, arrest in cell division, and apoptotic cell
death.

Gauthier et al. (2004) showed that huntingtin (613004) specifically
enhances vesicular transport of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF;
113505) along microtubules. They determined that huntingtin-mediated
transport involves huntingtin-associated protein-1 (HAP1; 600947) and
the p150(Glued) subunit of dynactin, an essential component of molecular
motors. BDNF transport was attenuated both in the disease context and by
reducing the levels of wildtype huntingtin. The alteration of the
huntingtin/HAP1/p150(Glued) complex correlated with reduced association
of motor proteins with microtubules. The
polyglutamine-huntingtin-induced transport deficit resulted in the loss
of neurotrophic support and neuronal toxicity. Gauthier et al. (2004)
concluded that a key role of huntingtin is to promote BDNF transport and
suggested that loss of this function might contribute to pathogenesis.

Using in vivo skin-specific lentiviral RNA interference, Williams et al.
(2011) investigated spindle orientation regulation and provided direct
evidence that LGN (609245), NuMA (164009), and dynactin are involved. In
compromising asymmetric cell divisions, Williams et al. (2011) uncovered
profound defects in stratification, differentiation, and barrier
formation, and implicated Notch (190198) signaling as an important
effector. Williams et al. (2011) concluded that asymmetric cell division
components act by reorientating mitotic spindles to achieve
perpendicular divisions, which in turn promote stratification and
differentiation. Furthermore, the resemblance between their knockdown
phenotypes and Rbpj (147183) loss-of-function mutants provided important
clues that suprabasal Notch signaling is impaired when asymmetric cell
divisions do not occur.

GENE STRUCTURE

Collin et al. (1998) found that the DCTN1 gene spans approximately 19.4
kb of genomic DNA and consists of at least 32 exons ranging in size from
15 to 499 bp.

Pushkin et al. (2001) showed by Southern blot and BAC analyses that the
DCTN1 and SLC4A5 (606757) proteins are encoded by a single locus. The
DCTN1-SLC4A5 locus spans approximately 230 kb and contains 66 exons.
Approximately 200 kb encode SLC4A5. DCTN1 is encoded by exons 1 through
alternative exon 32. The same locus therefore uniquely encodes both a
membrane protein (SLC4A5) and a cytoplasmic protein (DCTN1) with
distinct functions.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Holzbaur and Tokito (1996) mapped
the DCTN1 gene to 2p13. They noted that the location of the gene
corresponds to that of a form of recessive limb-girdle muscular
dystrophy (see LGMD2B; 253601). Also, this region of human chromosome 2
shows syntenic homology with a region of mouse chromosome 6 containing
the mnd2 mouse mutation, which exhibits symptoms resembling human motor
neuron disease.

Korthaus et al. (1997) presented evidence that the DCTN1 gene maps to
chromosome 2 between TGFA and D2S1394.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Puls et al. (2003) identified a gly59-to-ser mutation (601143.0001) in
the DCTN1 gene in a family with slowly progressive autosomal dominant
distal hereditary motor neuronopathy with vocal paresis (HMN7B; 607641).

Among 250 patients with a putative diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS; 105400), Munch et al. (2004) identified 3 mutations in
the DCTN1 gene (601143.0002-601143.0004) in 3 families. The authors
distinguished the phenotype in their patients from that reported by Puls
et al. (2003) by the presence of upper motor neuron signs, although
specific clinical details were lacking. Munch et al. (2004) suggested
that mutations in the DCTN1 gene may be a susceptibility factor for ALS.

In affected members of 8 families with Perry syndrome (168605), Farrer
et al. (2009) identified 5 different heterozygous mutations in the DCTN1
gene (see, e.g., 601143.0006-601143.0007). In vitro functional
expression studies indicated that the mutations resulted in decreased
microtubule binding and intracytoplasmic inclusions.

Vilarino-Guell et al. (2009) sequenced the DCTN1 gene in 286 individuals
with Parkinson disease (PD; 168600), frontotemporal lobar degeneration
(FTLD; 600274), or ALS. None of the 36 variants identified segregated
conclusively within families, suggesting that DCTN1 mutations are rare
and do not play a common role in these diseases. Further analysis of 440
patients with PD, 374 with FTLD, and 372 with ALS without a family
history also failed to find an association between DCTN1 variants and
disease. In fact, the previously reported pathogenic mutation T1249I
(601143.0002) was identified in 3 of 435 controls and did not segregate
in a large pedigree with Parkinson disease, thus weakening the evidence
for the pathogenicity of this variant.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
NEURONOPATHY, DISTAL HEREDITARY MOTOR, TYPE VIIB
DCTN1, GLY59SER

In a North American family with a slowly progressive, autosomal dominant
form of lower motor neuron with vocal cord paresis but without sensory
symptoms (607641), Puls et al. (2003) found a single-basepair change in
the DCTN1 gene (957C-T) resulting in an amino acid substitution of
serine for glycine at position 59 in affected family members. The G59S
substitution occurred in the highly conserved CAP-Gly motif of the
p150(Glued) subunit of dynactin, a domain that binds directly to
microtubules. The transport protein dynactin is required for
dynein-mediated retrograde transport of vesicles and organelles along
microtubules. Overexpression of dynamitin (607376), the p50 subunit of
the dynactin complex, disrupts the complex and produces a late-onset,
progressive motor neuron disease in transgenic mice (LaMonte et al.,
2002).

Based on crystal structure, gly59 is embedded in a beta-sheet. In
budding yeast, Moore et al. (2009) generated a G59S-analogous mutation
that resulted in complete loss of the CAP-Gly domain. Functional
expression studies showed that the CAP-Gly domain has a critical role in
the initiation and persistence of dynein-dependent movement of the
mitotic spindle and nucleus, but was otherwise dispensable for
dynein-based movement. The function also appeared to be
context-dependent, such as during mitosis, indicating that CAP-Gly
activity may only be necessary when dynein needs to overcome high force
thresholds to produce movement. The CAP-Gly domain was not the primary
link between dynactin and microtubules, although it was involved in the
interaction.

.0002
AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
DCTN1, THR1249ILE

In a woman with a disorder similar to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(105400), Munch et al. (2004) identified a heterozygous 4546C-T
transition in exon 13 of the DCTN1 gene, resulting in a thr1249-to-ile
(T1249I) substitution. She had disease onset at age 56 years, with gait
disturbance and distal lower limb muscle weakness and atrophy. The
symptoms were slowly progressive over 4 years. There was no involvement
of the upper limbs or bulbar region. There was no family history. The
mutation was not identified in 150 control subjects. See also 607641.

Vilarino-Guell et al. (2009) identified the T1249I variant in 3 of 435
controls, 5 of 440 patients with Parkinson disease (168600), 1 of 374
with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (600274), and 5 of 372 patients
with ALS. Lack of segregation of the variant in a large pedigree with
Parkinson disease weakened the evidence for the pathogenicity of this
variant.

.0003
AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
DCTN1, MET571THR

In a woman with probable ALS (105400), Munch et al. (2004) identified a
heterozygous 2512T-C transition in exon 15 of the DCTN1 gene, resulting
in a met571-to-thr (M571T) substitution. She had onset of upper limb
involvement at age 48 years and developed bulbar symptoms within 8
years. Her sister was similarly affected, although DNA was not
available. The mutation was not identified in 150 control subjects.

.0004
AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
DCTN1, ARG785TRP

In 2 brothers with probable ALS (105400), Munch et al. (2004) identified
a heterozygous 3153C-T transition in exon 20 of the DCTN1 gene,
resulting in an arg785-to-trp (R785W) substitution. The proband had
upper limb onset at age 55 years, whereas his brother had bulbar onset
at age 64 years. The asymptomatic mother and sister carried the same
mutation, suggesting incomplete penetrance. The mutation was not
identified in 150 control subjects.

.0005
AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
DCTN1, ARG1101LYS

In a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (105400), Munch et al.
(2005) identified a heterozygous 4102G-A transition in the DCTN1 gene,
resulting in an arg1101-to-lys (R1101K) substitution. The patient's
brother, who also carried the R1101K mutation, had frontotemporal
dementia without motor involvement. Family history revealed that 2
additional family members reportedly had motor neuron disease and
frontotemporal dementia, respectively, but their DNA was not available
for testing. The mutation was not identified in 500 control individuals.
Despite the molecular findings, Munch et al. (2005) suggested that the
R1101K variant may not be the primary gene defect in this family.

.0006
PERRY SYNDROME
DCTN1, GLY71ARG

In affected members of 2 unrelated families with Perry syndrome
(168605), Farrer et al. (2009) identified a heterozygous 211G-A
transition in exon 2 of the DCTN1 gene, resulting in a gly71-to-arg
(G71R) substitution in a highly conserved residue within the GKNDG
binding motif of the CAP-Gly domain. The families were of Canadian and
Turkish ancestry, respectively, and haplotype analysis excluded a
founder effect. In vitro functional expression studies showed that the
mutation decreased microtubule binding and resulted in intracytoplasmic
inclusions.

.0007
PERRY SYNDROME
DCTN1, GLN74PRO

In affected members of a Japanese family with Perry syndrome (168605),
Farrer et al. (2009) identified a heterozygous 221A-C transversion in
exon 2 of the DCTN1 gene, resulting in a gln74-to-pro (Q74P)
substitution in a highly conserved residue adjacent to the GKNDG binding
motif of the CAP-Gly domain. In vitro functional expression studies
showed that the mutation decreased microtubule binding and resulted in
intracytoplasmic inclusions.

614828	TITLE *614828 GLYCOSYLTRANSFERASE-LIKE DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; GTDC2
;;CHROMOSOME 3 OPEN READING FRAME 39; C3ORF39;;
AGO61
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using whole-exome sequencing to identify genes mutated in Walker-Warburg
syndrome (see 236670), Manzini et al. (2012) identified GTDC2. The
deduced 580-amino acid protein has an N-terminal signal peptide, a
central putative glycosyltransferase domain, and a C-terminal
fibronectin (135600) type III domain. Quantitative PCR detected variable
GTDC2 expression in all adult and fetal tissues examined, with highest
expression in pancreas, followed by adult and fetal brain, testis,
skeletal muscle, heart, kidney, ovary, and prostate. Within specific
brain regions, highest expression was detected in cerebellum and cortex.
In situ hybridization showed high expression during brain and eye
development in mouse. Expression in embryonic mouse cortex peaked during
the last week of gestation in both neuronal progenitors in the
ventricular zone and migrating and differentiating neurons. Expression
declined around birth. A similar expression pattern was detected in
developing zebrafish.

GENE STRUCTURE

Manzini et al. (2012) determined that GTDC2 is a single-exon gene.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Manzini et al. (2012) mapped the GTDC2
gene to chromosome 3p22.1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 3 unrelated consanguineous families with
congenital muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy with brain and eye
anomalies type A8 (MDDGA8; 614830), Manzini et al. (2012) identified 3
different homozygous mutations in the GTDC2 gene
(614828.0001-614828.0003). The first 2 mutations were identified by
homozygosity mapping combined with whole-exome sequencing and confirmed
by Sanger sequencing. All patients had classic features of
Walker-Warburg syndrome, including cobblestone lissencephaly, enlarged
ventricles, cerebellar hypoplasia, and eye abnormalities, resulting in
early death.

ANIMAL MODEL

Manzini et al. (2012) found that knockdown of Gtdc2 expression in
zebrafish replicated many features of Walker-Warburg syndrome, including
hydrocephalus, ocular defects, and muscular dystrophy. Gtdc2 knockdown
severely decreased survival, but those embryos that survived were
shorter than controls and often had a bent tail, impaired motility,
smaller eyes in which the retina failed to fuse ventrally, and a domed
appearance of the top of the head. Other features included
hydrocephalus, a reduction in brain volume, disorganization of the
retinal epithelium, and impaired muscle development with a loss of both
dystrophin and glycosylated dystroglycan from the myosepta.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY-DYSTROGLYCANOPATHY (CONGENITAL WITH BRAIN AND EYE
ANOMALIES), TYPE A, 8
GTDC2, ARG445TER

In a Jordanian boy, born of consanguineous parents, with congenital
muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy with brain and eye anomalies type
A8 (MDDGA8; 614830), Manzini et al. (2012) identified a homozygous
1333C-T transition in the GTDC2 gene, resulting in an arg445-to-ter
(R445X) substitution and premature protein truncation. The mutation,
which was identified by homozygosity mapping combined with whole-exome
sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing, was not found in several
large databases or in 384 ethnically matched controls. Each unaffected
parent was heterozygous for the mutation. The patient had classic
features of Walker-Warburg syndrome, including cobblestone
lissencephaly, enlarged ventricles, cerebellar hypoplasia, and eye
abnormalities, and died at age 2 months.

.0002
MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY-DYSTROGLYCANOPATHY (CONGENITAL WITH BRAIN AND EYE
ANOMALIES), TYPE A, 8
GTDC2, ARG158HIS

In a girl, born of Saudi Arabian parents, with MDDGA8 (614830), Manzini
et al. (2012) identified a homozygous 473G-A transition in the GTDC2
gene, resulting in an arg158-to-his (R158H) substitution at a highly
conserved residue adjacent to the start of the glycosyltransferase
domain. The mutation, which was identified by homozygosity mapping
combined with whole-exome sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing,
was not found in several large databases or in 384 ethnically matched
controls. Each unaffected parent was heterozygous for the mutation. The
patient had classic features of Walker-Warburg syndrome, including
cobblestone lissencephaly, enlarged ventricles, cerebellar hypoplasia,
and eye abnormalities, and died at age 1 month.

.0003
MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY-DYSTROGLYCANOPATHY (CONGENITAL WITH BRAIN AND EYE
ANOMALIES), TYPE A, 8
GTDC2, TRP197TER

In 2 sib fetuses, of consanguineous Indian parents, with MDDGA8
(614830), Manzini et al. (2012) identified a homozygous 590G-A
transition in the GTDC2 gene, resulting in a trp197-to-ter (W197X)
substitution and premature protein truncation in the glycosyltransferase
domain. Each unaffected parent was heterozygous for the mutation. The
pregnancies were terminated at gestation week 23 and 20 because of a
diagnosis of severe ventricular enlargement. Autopsy showed classic
features of Walker-Warburg syndrome, including cobblestone lissencephaly
and cerebellar hypoplasia.

610874	TITLE *610874 SPERMATOGENESIS- AND CENTRIOLE-ASSOCIATED 1; SPATC1
;;SPERIOLIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis with Cdc20 (603618) N-terminal and
C-terminal sequences as bait to screen a mouse testis cDNA library,
followed by 5-prime RACE of mouse testis cDNA, Goto and Eddy (2004)
cloned mouse Spatc1, which they called speriolin. The deduced 480-amino
acid mouse protein has a calculated molecular mass of 51.4 kD and
contains an N-terminal leucine zipper motif. Northern blot analysis
detected Spatc1 expression exclusively in mouse testis. Western blot
analysis detected Spatc1 in the insoluble fraction of testis tissue.
Immunohistochemical analysis detected Spatc1 in discrete spots in the
cytoplasm of pachytene spermatocytes, spermatocytes undergoing meiotic
division, round spermatids, and condensed spermatids. Spatc1 colocalized
with the centrosomal protein pericentrin (PCNT1; 170285). Studies with
deletion mutants expressed in BALB/3T3 cells showed that centrosomal
localization requires the N-terminal leucine zipper domain. By trypsin
digestion analysis of cell fractions expressing Spatc1 mutants, Goto and
Eddy (2004) concluded that Spatc1 localized to the cytoplasmic face of a
nonmembranous component, such as the centrosome.

GENE FUNCTION

Using GST pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation assays, Goto and Eddy
(2004) showed that mouse Spatc1 binds Cdc20 and Cdc27 (116946), both of
which are components of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC). Yeast
2-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation studies showed that the C-terminal
region of Spatc1 is required for binding to Cdc20. The C-terminal WD
motif (WD7-beta-4) of Cdc20 mediated Cdc20/Spatc1 interaction,
suggesting that the Cdc20 beta-propeller structure is required for
binding to Spatc1. Coimmunoprecipitation assays showed that Spatc1 binds
centrosomal protein gamma-tubulin (TUBG1; 191135) but not ODF1 (182878)
or ODF2 (602015).

GENE STRUCTURE

Goto and Eddy (2004) determined that the mouse Spatc1 gene contains 5
exons spanning approximately 23.8 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Goto and Eddy (2004) mapped the mouse
Spatc1 gene to mouse chromosome 15D3, which has homology of synteny to
human chromosome 8q24.

613964	TITLE *613964 TASTE RECEPTOR, TYPE 2, MEMBER 40; TAS2R40
;;T2R40
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TAS2R40 belongs to a family of intronless genes that encode highly
related bitter taste receptors (TAS2Rs). TAS2Rs are G protein-coupled
receptors, which are characterized by 7 transmembrane domains (summary
by Fischer et al., 2005). For further information on the TAS2R gene
family, see 604791.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Fischer et al. (2005) mapped the TAS2R40
gene to a TAS2R gene cluster on chromosome 7q31. Gross (2011) mapped the
TAS2R40 gene to chromosome 7q34 based on an alignment of the TAS2R40
sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF494229) with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 2A, REGULATORY SUBUNIT B-PRIME;;
PHOSPHOTYROSYL PHOSPHATASE ACTIVATOR; PTPA;;
PR53
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PPP2R4, or PTPA, encodes a specific phosphotyrosyl phosphatase activator
of the dimeric form of protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A; see 176915) (Van
Hoof et al., 1995).

GENE FUNCTION

The core component of PP2A consists of a catalytic (C) subunit (e.g.,
PPP2CA; 176915) and a scaffold protein (A) subunit (e.g., PPP2R1A;
605983). Using purified recombinant proteins, Chao et al. (2006) found
that PTPA and PP2A A-C dimers constituted a composite ATPase, and the
interaction was independent of ATP or magnesium ion. The inclusion of
PTPA altered the substrate specificity of PP2A, with enhanced
phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity and decreased phosphoserine
phosphatase activity.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Chao et al. (2006) reported the 1.9-angstrom crystal structure of human
PTPA, which revealed a fold consisting of a core, a lid, and an extended
linker joining the core and lid. Structural analysis uncovered a highly
conserved surface patch bordering these 3 subdomains, as well as an
associated deep pocket between the core and linker subdomains. Further
analysis showed that the surface patch binds the PP2A A-C dimer, and the
deep pocket binds ATP.

GENE STRUCTURE

Van Hoof et al. (1995) demonstrated that human PTPA is encoded by a
single-copy gene composed of 10 exons and 9 introns with a total length
of about 60 kb. The 5-prime flanking sequence of the transcription start
site was analyzed for its potential as a promoter. This region lacks a
TATA sequence in the appropriate position relative to the transcription
start. However, this region is very GC-rich and contains 4 Sp1 sites
(SP1; 189906) upstream of the transcription start site, a feature common
to many TATA-less promoters. Based on homology with DNA-binding
consensus sequences of transcription factors, Van Hoof et al. (1995)
identified several additional putative transcription factor binding
sites in the promoter region. Transfection experiments with a construct
containing the PTPA promoter region inserted 5-prime of a luciferase
reporter gene demonstrated that the 5-prime flanking sequence of the
PTPA gene indeed has promoter activity that seems to be cell-line
dependent.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Van Hoof et al. (1995) mapped the
PTPA gene to 9q34. Fluorescence in situ analysis of metaphase
chromosomes of patients bearing the Philadelphia chromosome indicated
that PTPA is positioned centromeric of ABL1 (189980) and probably is not
involved in chronic myeloid leukemia.

;;DORA REVERSE STRAND; DREV
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Bates et al. (2000) identified ESTs containing sequences complementary
to the region 5-prime of the mouse and human IGSF6 genes (606222). The
deduced proteins, designated DREV (DORA reverse strand) proteins, show
weak homology to ribosomal RNA adenine dimethylases and contain
conserved consensus sequences for the recognition of nucleotide methyl
groups and possibly for methyl group transfer. Northern blot analysis of
mouse tissues detected ubiquitous and variable Drev expression.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bates et al. (2000) determined that the DREV gene contains 5 exons. The
5-prime UTR has a high GC content. Intron 4 of the DREV gene contains
the entire IGSF6 gene on the complementary strand, and there is a
retrotransposon-like sequence between the 3-prime end of the IGSF6 gene
and exon 4 of the DREV gene.

MAPPING

By FISH, Bates et al. (2000) mapped the mouse Drev gene to a region of
chromosome 7F2-F3 that shows homology of synteny with human chromosome
16p12-p11. Bates et al. (1998) had earlier mapped the human IGSF6 gene
to chromosome 16p13.

601579	TITLE *601579 ORNITHINE DECARBOXYLASE ANTIZYME 1; OAZ1
;;OAZ;;
ANTIZYME 1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Antizyme (ornithine decarboxylase antizyme) is the sole animal gene
product known to be expressed with translational frameshifting (Rom and
Kahana, 1994; Matsufuji et al., 1995). Elevation of cellular polyamine
levels induces antizyme synthesis by raising frameshift efficiency.
Matsufuji et al. (1996) noted that induced antizyme prevents further
increase in polyamines by binding to ornithine decarboxylase (ODC;
165640), a key regulatory enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis, which
accelerates degradation of ODC by the 26S proteasome. Antizyme also
inhibits cellular uptake of polyamines.

CLONING

Tewari et al. (1994) reported the sequence of a human antizyme cDNA
cloned from gingival fibroblasts. Matsufuji et al. (1996) obtained an
antizyme cDNA from human liver based on the rat cDNA sequence. The 2
sequences are almost identical with each other. On Southern analysis, a
single gene was detected.

Hayashi et al. (1997) reported the complete nucleotide sequence of the
human antizyme gene.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hayashi et al. (1997) determined that the human antizyme gene consists
of 5 exons.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Matsufuji et al. (1996) assigned
the antizyme gene to 19p13.3. Thus, the human antizyme gene is not
linked with the ornithine decarboxylase gene, which is located on 2p.

ANIMAL MODEL

Mackintosh et al. (2000) generated transgenic mice in which a very high
level of constitutive antizyme-1 expression was directed specifically to
the heart through the use of a cardiac-specific promoter. The high
antizyme level did not abolish endogenous ODC activity and allowed
apparently normal cardiac growth. However, a single acute dose of, or
prolonged exposure to, isoproterenol caused substantially increased
cardiac ODC activity and subsequent polyamine accumulation in
nontransgenic but not in transgenic mice.

;;VIP36;;
GP36B
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to dog Vip36, Neve et
al. (2003) identified LMAN2, which they called VIP36. The deduced
356-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal signal sequence, followed
by a lectin-type carbohydrate recognition domain and a C-terminal
transmembrane domain. A KRFY endoplasmic reticulum trafficking motif is
located at the C terminus. Northern blot analysis detected variable
expression of 1.2- and 1.4-kb VIP36 transcripts in all tissues examined.
Highest expression was in kidney, placenta, and liver.

GENE STRUCTURE

Nufer et al. (2003) determined that the LMAN2 gene contains 8 exons and
spans 14.9 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Nufer et al. (2003) mapped the LMAN2 gene
to chromosome 5q35.5.

604661	TITLE *604661 POTASSIUM CHANNEL-INTERACTING PROTEIN 2; KCNIP2
;;KCHIP2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In the brain and heart, rapidly inactivating (A-type) voltage-gated
potassium (Kv) currents operate at subthreshold membrane potentials to
control the excitability of neurons and cardiac myocytes. An et al.
(2000) described 3 Kv channel-interacting proteins called KCHIPs that
bind to the cytoplasmic amino termini of Kv4-alpha subunits. See KCHIP1
(604660). The KCHIP2 cDNA encodes a 252-amino acid protein that has a
distinct amino terminus but shares approximately 70% amino acid identity
with KCHIP1 and KCHIP3 throughout a carboxy-terminal 185-amino acid core
domain containing 4 EF-hand-like motifs. Expression of KCHIP2 and Kv4
together reconstituted several features of native A-type currents by
modulating the density, inactivation kinetics, and rate of recovery from
inactivation of Kv4 channels in heterologous cells. The KCHIPs
colocalized and coimmunoprecipitated with brain Kv4-alpha subunits and
are thus integral components of native Kv4 channel complexes.

GENE FUNCTION

Jeyaraj et al. (2012) provided molecular evidence that links circadian
rhythms to vulnerability in ventricular arrhythmias in mice.
Specifically, they showed that cardiac ion channel expression and QT
interval duration (an index of myocardial repolarization) exhibit
endogenous circadian rhythmicity under the control of a clock-dependent
oscillator, Kruppel-like factor-15 (KLF15; 606465). Klf15
transcriptionally controls rhythmic expression of KChIP2, a critical
subunit required for generating the transient outward potassium current.
Deficiency or excess of Klf15 causes loss of rhythmic QT variation,
abnormal repolarization, and enhanced susceptibility to ventricular
arrhythmias. Jeyaraj et al. (2012) concluded that their findings
identified circadian transcription of ion channels as a mechanism for
cardiac arrhythmogenesis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Kuo et al. (2001) found that knockout mice deficient for Kchip2
exhibited normal cardiac structure and function but displayed a
prolonged elevation in the ST segment on the electrocardiogram. The
Kchip2 -/- mice were highly susceptible to the induction of cardiac
arrhythmias. Single-cell analysis revealed a substrate for
arrhythmogenesis, including a complete absence of transient outward
potassium current (I-to) and a marked increase in action potential
duration. These studies demonstrated that a defect in KCHIP2 is
sufficient to confer a marked genetic susceptibility to arrhythmias,
establishing a novel genetic pathway for ventricular tachycardia via a
loss of the transmural gradient of I-to.

RAL-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1; RIP1;;
DINITROPHENYL S-GLUTATHIONE ATPase;;
DNP-SG ATPase
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

RALBP1 plays a role in receptor-mediated endocytosis and is a downstream
effector of the small GTP-binding protein RAL (see RALA; 179550). Small
G proteins, such as RAL, have GDP-bound inactive and GTP-bound active
forms, which shift from the inactive to the active state through the
action of RALGDS (601619), which in turn is activated by RAS (see HRAS;
190020) (summary by Feig, 2003). RALBP1 is also the dominant transporter
of lipid peroxidation-derived glutathione conjugates (Singhal et al.,
2013) and participates in several mitotic events, including inactivation
of endocytosis and separation and polar movement of centrioles (Rosse et
al., 2003) and appropriate distribution of mitochondria to daughter
cells following mitosis (Kashatus et al., 2011).

CLONING

Using a mutant form of RALA lacking the C-terminal 27 amino acids as
bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a Jurkat cDNA library, followed by
5-prime RACE and screening skeletal muscle and placenta cDNA libraries,
Jullien-Flores et al. (1995) obtained a cDNA encoding RALBP1, which they
termed RLIP76. The deduced 655-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 76 kD. It is homologous in the central region to
proteins bearing a CDC42 (116952)/RHO (see 165390)/RAC (see RAC1;
602048) GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity, such as BCR (see
151410). Sequence analysis predicted that RALBP1 has an N-terminal
alpha-helical region, the GAP-like region, the RAL-binding region, and
the C-terminal region. Northern blot analysis detected ubiquitous,
low-level expression of RALBP1.

Awasthi et al. (2000) cloned a dinitrophenyl glutathione ATPase
identical to RALBP1. They found that RALBP1 had an apparent molecular
mass of 95 kD by SDS-PAGE.

MAPPING

By FISH analysis, Jullien-Flores et al. (1995) mapped the RALBP1 gene to
chromosome 18p11.

GENE FUNCTION

Binding analysis by Jullien-Flores et al. (1995) showed that RALBP1
interacted with RALA and RALB (179551), but with no other GTPases except
RAC1.

Awasthi et al. (2000) reported that recombinant RALBP1 had ATPase
activity that was stimulated by doxorubicin (DOX), which it transported
in an ATP-dependent manner, and mediated resistance to DOX. They
concluded that, in addition to its role in signal transduction, RALBP1
can catalyze the transport of glutathione conjugates and xenobiotics,
potentially contributing to multidrug resistance.

Phosphorylation of epsin (EPN1; 607262), an endocytic accessory protein,
by CDK1 (116940) renders the molecule incompetent for endocytosis during
mitosis. Using yeast 2-hybrid screens of human placenta and Drosophila
embryo cDNA libraries, Rosse et al. (2003) found that RLIP76 interacted
with the CDK1 partner cyclin B (CCNB1; 123836). Cyclin B and RLIP76
interacted in vitro and in vivo in both fly and human, and RLIP76
associated with the active cyclin B1-CDK1 complex during mitosis. During
both interphase and mitosis, RLIP76 interacted with the endocytotic
proteins Numb (603728) and AP2 (see 601026) and both phosphorylated and
nonphosphorylated forms of epsin. Phosphorylation and inactivation of
epsin also required RAL signaling. Rosse et al. (2003) proposed that
RLIP76 serves as a scaffold to assemble an endocytotic complex during
interphase and recruits cyclin B-CDK1 to phosphorylate epsin and switch
off endocytosis during mitosis.

Singhal et al. (2009) stated that RLIP76 is frequently overexpressed in
malignant cells and functions to oppose apoptosis by limiting the
accumulation of endogenous or exogenous toxic electrophilic compounds.
They found that RLIP76 was overexpressed in Caki-2 human kidney cancer
cells compared with normal mesangial cells. Inside-out vesicles prepared
from Caki-2 cells showed higher ATP-dependent uptake of doxorubicin and
dinitrophenyl-S-glutathione than vesicles prepared from normal mesangial
cells. Depletion of RLIP76 via antisense RNA, small interfering RNA, or
anti-RLIP76 antibody caused extensive apoptosis of Caki-2 cells in
culture and regression of Caki-2 tumors in nude mice.

Equal distribution of mitochondria to daughter cells during mitosis
requires fission, which depends on recruitment of the large GTPase DRP1
(DNM1L; 603850) to the outer mitochondrial membrane and phosphorylation
of DRP1 by cyclin B-CDK1. Using M-phase HeLa cells, Kashatus et al.
(2011) found that the mitotic kinase Aurora A (AURKA; 603072)
phosphorylated RALA at ser194, resulting in redistribution of RALA to
mitochondria, where it recruited RALBP1 and DRP1. Subsequently, RALBP1
induced cyclin B-CDK1-dependent phosphorylation of DRP1. Knockdown of
RALBP1, but not RALA, decreased the amount of phosphorylated DRP1.
Knockdown of either RALA or RALBP1 blocked mitochondrial fission,
causing unequal partitioning of mitochondria between daughter cells,
reduced cellular content of ATP, and decreased numbers of metabolically
active cells. Kashatus et al. (2011) concluded that the mitotic kinases
Aurora A and cyclin B-CDK1 converge on RALA and RALBP1 to promote
mitochondrial fission and appropriate distribution of mitochondria to
daughter cells.

ANIMAL MODEL

Singhal et al. (2013) found that Rlip76 -/- mice were hypertensive and
showed significant increases in both systolic and diastolic blood
pressure compared with wildtype mice. Rlip76 -/- mice also showed poorer
renal filtration, with significant loss of glomeruli. Western blot
analysis and real-time quantitative PCR showed that hypertension was due
to overactive renin (REN; 179820)-angiotensin (106150) signaling.
However, Rlip76 -/- mice were also significantly resistant to obesity
and several other features of metabolic syndrome caused by ingesting a
high-fat diet. Rlip76 -/- mice showed reduced rates of insulin and
adipokine resistance, inflammation and fibrosis of adipose and kidney,
glucose tolerance and hyperlipidemia, metabolic derangements, and liver
abnormalities. Singhal et al. (2013) concluded that RLIP76 is necessary
for development of high-fat diet-induced obesity and metabolic syndrome.

608939	TITLE *608939 RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN S6 KINASE, 70-KD, 2; RPS6KB2
;;S6K2;;
p70 S6 KINASE, BETA;;
p70(S6K)-BETA;;
p70-BETA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

RPS6KB2 is a serine/threonine kinase that is activated by mitogenic
stimuli, including growth factors, cytokines, and phorbol esters. The
activated enzyme phosphorylates several serine residues in the C
terminus of ribosomal protein S6 (180460) (Saitoh et al., 1998).

CLONING

By searching EST databases for sequences conserved in S6 kinases,
followed by screening a human embryonic kidney cell line cDNA library,
Gout et al. (1998) cloned 2 variants of RPS6KB2, which they designated
p70 beta-1 and beta-2. The deduced proteins contain 495 and 482 amino
acids, respectively, and are identical except for the 13-amino acid
N-terminal extension in beta-1, which contains a putative nuclear
localization signal. The variants could be expressed through alternative
mRNA splicing or through the use of an alternative in-frame AUG codon
close to the 5-prime end of the cDNA. The p70 beta proteins contain an
N-terminal noncatalytic region, a central catalytic domain, a kinase
extension domain, an autoinhibitory domain, and a C-terminal tail. The
p70 beta protein shares 70% identity with the p70 alpha protein
(RPS6KB1; 608938), and 7 serine or threonine phosphorylation sites are
conserved. Most differences are located in the N- and C-terminal
domains, including the presence of a unique C-terminal proline-rich
region in p70 beta. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.2-kb transcript
in all tissues examined.

Using degenerate primers based on serine/threonine kinases, followed by
screening an erythroleukemia cell cDNA library, Saitoh et al. (1998)
cloned p70 S6K beta. The deduced protein contains 481 amino acids.
Northern blot analysis detected major transcripts of 1.8 and 5.0 kb in
all tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Gout et al. (1998) examined the catalytic activity of p70 beta-2
transiently expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing
human insulin receptor (147670). S6 kinase activity was stimulated by
insulin, serum, phorbol ester, and PDGF (see 190040). In human embryonic
kidney cells, serum-activated kinase activity was inhibited by rapamycin
and wortmannin in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that MTOR (601231)
and PI3 kinase (see 602925) are involved in p70 beta-2 activation.
However, the potency of inhibition was lower than that for p70 alpha-1,
indicating that other mechanisms also regulate p70 beta-2 activity.

Saitoh et al. (1998) characterized p70 S6K beta expressed by human
embryonic kidney cells. A 32-mer S6 peptide was phosphorylated by the
wildtype kinase, but not by a catalytically inactivated lys98-to-arg
mutant kinase.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the RPS6KB2
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP RH41895).

ANIMAL MODEL

Pende et al. (2004) found that mice deficient in S6k1 or S6k2 were born
at expected mendelian ratios. Compared with wildtype mice, S6k1 -/- mice
were significantly smaller, and S6k2 -/- mice tended to be slightly
larger. Mice lacking both genes showed a sharp reduction in viability
due to perinatal lethality. Analysis of S6 phosphorylation in the
cytoplasm and nucleoli of cells derived from each S6k genotype suggested
that both kinases are required for full S6 phosphorylation, but that
S6k2 may contribute more to the response. Despite the impairment of S6
phosphorylation in cells from double-knockout mice, cell cycle
progression and translation of 5-prime terminal oligopyrimidine mRNAs
were still modulated by mitogens in a rapamycin-dependent manner.
Double-knockout cells also showed persistence of S6 phosphorylation on
the first 2 serines phosphorylated in response to mitogens, and this
step was catalyzed by a MAPK-dependent kinase. Pende et al. (2004)
concluded that a redundancy exists between the S6K and MAPK pathways in
mediating early S6 phosphorylation in response to mitogens.

606802	TITLE *606802 SPIB TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR; SPIB
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SPI1 (165170) and SPIB are members of a subfamily of ETS (see ETS1;
164720) transcription factors. ETS proteins share a conserved ETS domain
that mediates specific DNA binding. SPIB and SPI1 bind to a purine-rich
sequence, the PU box (5-prime-GAGGAA-3-prime).

CLONING

By screening a Burkitt lymphoma cDNA library with a cDNA probe
corresponding to the DNA-binding region of SPI1, Ray et al. (1992)
isolated a cDNA encoding SPIB. The deduced 262-amino acid protein is 43%
identical to SPI1. It has a basic C terminus that is 67% identical to
that of SPI1, as well as an acidic, proline-rich N-terminal domain. Gel
retardation and competition binding analyses confirmed that SPIB
interacts with PU boxes. Reporter analyses showed that SPIB encodes a PU
box-specific transcription activator. Northern blot analysis revealed
expression of a major 1.5-kb transcript, as well as minor 2.8- and
3.7-kb transcripts, in a B-lymphoid cell line and lower expression in
promyelocytic and monocytic cell lines. Expression was restricted to
spleen, predominantly, and thymus in mouse tissues.

Ray-Gallet et al. (1996) identified a 177-amino acid SPIB splice variant
whose N-terminal 162 residues are identical to SPIB. However, the
variant lacks the C-terminal ETS-containing, DNA-binding domain.
Northern blot analysis suggested that the variant is encoded by the
2.8-kb transcript. RT-PCR analysis detected expression of the variant at
a ratio of 10% of the full-length transcript in both B-cell lines and
primary B cells. Western blot analysis showed cytoplasmic expression of
the 40-kD truncated isoform and nuclear and cytoplasmic expression of
the 46-kD full-length protein; both masses were higher than the
predicted sizes of 18 and 28 kD, respectively.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ray-Gallet et al. (1996) determined that the SPIB gene contains at least
6 exons spanning more than 20 kb. Intron 5 spans 10 kb, and the
DNA-binding domain is encoded by exon 6.

MAPPING

Using in situ hybridization, Ray et al. (1992) mapped the SPIB gene to
chromosome 19q13.3-q13.4.

605504	TITLE *605504 KALLIKREIN-RELATED PEPTIDASE 9; KLK9
;;KALLIKREIN 9;;
KALLIKREIN-LIKE 3; KLKL3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

KLK9 belongs to the kallikrein subgroup of serine proteases, which have
diverse physiologic functions in many tissues. For background
information on kallikreins, see 147960.

CLONING

Based on homology between the human and mouse kallikrein loci, Yousef
and Diamandis (2000) defined a 300-kb human kallikrein gene region on
chromosome 19q13.3-q13.4. Within this region, they identified a new
kallikrein gene, KLK9, which they designated KLKL3. The deduced
250-amino acid KLK9 protein has a predicted molecular mass of 27.5 kD
and shares 40% amino acid sequence identity with KLK11 (604434). RT-PCR
analysis showed that KLK9 is primarily expressed in thymus, testis,
spinal cord, cerebellum, trachea, mammary gland, prostate, brain,
salivary gland, ovary, and skin. Lower levels of expression are seen in
fetal brain, stomach, lung, thyroid, placenta, liver, small intestine,
and bone marrow. No expression is seen in uterus, heart, fetal liver,
adrenal gland, colon, spleen, skeletal muscle, pancreas, or kidney.

GENE FUNCTION

Yousef and Diamandis (2000) determined that the KLK9 gene is regulated
by steroid hormones in a human breast cancer cell line.

Many members of the human kallikrein gene family are differentially
expressed in various malignancies, and some are useful cancer
diagnostic/prognostic markers. Yousef et al. (2001) performed a
quantitative analysis of KLK9 expression in ovarian cancer. The results
indicated that KLK9 is under steroid hormone regulation in ovarian and
breast cancer cell lines. Immunohistochemically, the protein was
localized in the cytoplasm, but not in the nuclei, of the epithelial
cells of ovarian cancer tissues. The authors concluded that KLK9 is a
potential independent favorable prognostic marker for early-stage,
low-grade, optimally debulked ovarian cancer patients.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yousef and Diamandis (2000) determined that the KLK9 gene contains 5
coding exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Yousef and Diamandis (2000) mapped the
KLK9 gene within a 300-kb human kallikrein gene region on chromosome
19q13.3-q13.4.

;;SCAVENGER RECEPTOR EXPRESSED BY ENDOTHELIAL CELLS 2; SREC2;;
SREC II
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching human BAC clones and an EST database for sequences similar
to murine Scarf1 (SCARF1; 607873) and Scarf2, Ishii et al. (2002)
identified SCARF2, which they called SREC II. The deduced human and
murine SCARF2 proteins contain 872 and 834 amino acids, respectively.
SCARF2 contains an N-terminal signal sequence, followed by 10
extracellular EGF (161530)-like repeats, a transmembrane domain, and a
cytoplasmic domain rich in serine, proline, glycine, and arginine
residues. SCARF2 also has 2 extracellular N-glycosylation sites and
several potential intracellular phosphorylation sites. Northern blot
analysis detected a SCARF2 transcript of about 3.5 kb in most human
tissues examined, with highest expression in heart, placenta, lung,
kidney, spleen, small intestine, and ovary. This expression pattern was
similar to that of SCARF1.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Ishii et al. (2002) mapped the SCARF2 gene
to chromosome 22q11. They mapped the mouse Scarf2 gene to chromosome 16.

GENE FUNCTION

Ishii et al. (2002) found that mouse Scarf2 was much less efficient than
Scarf1 in stimulating uptake of modified low density lipoproteins in
transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells, suggesting that Scarf2 has
little scavenger receptor activity. When mouse fibroblast L cells
expressing Scarf1 on their surface were mixed with L cells expressing
Scarf2, they showed a strong tendency to aggregate. In contrast,
individual L-cell clones expressing only Scarf1 or Scarf2 showed a much
lower tendency to aggregate.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 4 patients from 3 consanguineous Qatari families with van den
Ende-Gupta syndrome (VDEGS; 600920), Anastasio et al. (2010) analyzed
candidate genes and identified homozygosity for a missense mutation in 2
cousins from 1 kindred and a 2-bp deletion in 2 unrelated patients
(613619.0001 and 613619.0002, respectively).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
VAN DEN ENDE-GUPTA SYNDROME
SCARF2, CYS258TYR

In 2 cousins from a highly consanguineous Qatari family with van den
Ende-Gupta syndrome (600920), previously reported by Ali et al. (2010)
(family 1), Anastasio et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for a 773G-A
transition in exon 4 of the SCARF2 gene, resulting in a cys258-to-tyr
(C258Y) substitution at a highly conserved residue, predicted to
eliminate the formation of the respective disulfide bridge within the
putative EGF (131530)-like domain and thus affect folding of this
domain. The 773G-A variant was detected in 1 of 54 Qatar Bedouin members
of the same tribe as the patients, for an estimated frequency of 1/108
in the tribe, translating to an incidence of at least 1 in 12,000. The
unaffected mother of 1 of the cousins was heterozygous for the mutation,
which was not found in 2 unaffected sibs of that cousin or in 59 Arab,
11 Iranian, 8 Southwest Asian, and 64 northern European controls.

SCARF2, 2-BP DEL, 1328TG

In 2 patients with van den Ende-Gupta syndrome (600920) from 2
consanguineous Qatari families from the same highly inbred Bedouin
tribe, previously reported by Ali et al. (2010) (families 2 and 3,
respectively), Anastasio et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for a
2-bp deletion (1328delTG) in exon 8 of the SCARF2 gene, resulting in a
frameshift causing a premature stop codon (V443DfsX83). The unaffected
mother of 1 of the patients was heterozygous for the deletion, which was
not found in 54 Qatar Bedouin members of the same tribe as the patients,
or in 59 Arab, 11 Iranian, 8 Southwest Asian, and 64 Northern European
controls.

607164	TITLE *607164 LADY BIRD-LIKE HOMEOBOX 2; LBX2
;;LADY BIRD LATE, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By EST database searching for sequences homologous to mouse Lbx2, Chen
et al. (2001) identified the human homolog, which encodes a deduced
198-amino acid protein that shares 64% sequence identity with the mouse
protein. Like mouse Lbx2, the human protein contains a conserved
homeodomain in exon 2 and a conserved 6-amino acid lady bird sequence in
exon 1.

GENE FUNCTION

Lady bird genes in Drosophila play important roles in neurogenesis, in
myogenesis, and in specifying cardioblasts (Jagla et al., 1998). In the
mouse, Lbx2 is expressed in the developing urogenital system, the eye,
and the central nervous system (Chen et al., 1999). Chen et al. (2001)
demonstrated in transgenic mice that 9 kb of the 5-prime genomic
flanking region contains the Lbx2 promoter and regulatory regions that
are sufficient to recapitulate endogenous Lbx2 expression. In mouse
embryos at 11.5 days of gestation, this promoter exhibited tissue
specificity for the urogenital ridge, the trigeminal ganglion, and
nodose ganglion.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chen et al. (2001) determined that both the mouse and human LBX2 genes
contain 2 exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Chen et al. (2001) mapped the mouse Lbx2
gene to chromosome 6 in a region of conserved synteny with human
2p13-p12. Using electronic PCR, they mapped the human contig containing
the LBX2 gene to chromosome 2p13.

600667	TITLE *600667 FRIZZLED, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 2; FZD2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Following up on the identification of trinucleotide repeat expansions as
the basis of many inherited human disorders, Zhao et al. (1995) isolated
and characterized cDNAs containing trinucleotide repeats. In the course
of these studies, they discovered a human homolog of the Drosophila
polarity gene 'frizzled' (fz). The fz locus in Drosophila is required
for the transmission of polarity signals across the plasma membrane in
epidermal cells. The Drosophila fz gene encodes a protein with 7
putative transmembrane domains that is thought to function as a G
protein-coupled receptor. Zhao et al. (1995) isolated a human homolog,
symbolized FZD2, from a human ovarian cDNA library. The full-length cDNA
of FZD2 encodes a protein of 565 amino acids that shares 56% sequence
identity with Drosophila fz protein. Zhao et al. (1995) found that the
expression of the FZD2 gene appears to be developmentally regulated,
with high levels of expression in fetal kidney and lung and in adult
colon and ovary. The structure of FZD2 suggests that it has a role in
transmembrane signal transmission, although its precise physiologic
function and associated pathways have yet to be determined. Wang et al.
(1996) showed that a large family of frizzled homologs exists in
mammals. These authors also isolated another human homolog, 'frizzled
5,' (601723).

GENE FUNCTION

The rat frizzled-2 receptor binds Wnt proteins and can signal by
activating calcium release from intracellular stores. Ahumada et al.
(2002) demonstrated that the wildtype Fzd2 and a chimeric receptor
consisting of the extracellular and transmembrane portions of the
beta-2-adrenergic receptor with cytoplasmic domains of Fzd2 also
signaled through modulation of cGMP. Activation of either receptor led
to a decline in the intracellular concentration of cGMP, a process that
was inhibited in cells treated with pertussis toxin, reduced by
suppression of the expression of the G protein transducin (GNAT2;
139340), and suppressed through inhibition of cGMP-specific
phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity. Moreover, Ahumada et al. (2002) showed
that PDE inhibitors blocked Fzd2-induced calcium transients in zebrafish
embryos. Thus, Ahumada et al. (2002) concluded that FZD2 appears to
couple to PDEs and calcium transients through G proteins.

MAPPING

Zhao et al. (1995) mapped the human FZD2 gene to 17q21.1 by fluorescence
in situ hybridization. Wang et al. (1996) mapped the FZD2 gene to mouse
chromosome 11, syntenic to human chromosome 17q, by interspecific
backcross analysis.

;;COMPLEMENT RECEPTOR TYPE 3, ALPHA SUBUNIT; CR3A;;
Mac1, ALPHA SUBUNIT; MAC1A;;
Mo1, ALPHA SUBUNIT; MO1A;;
CD11B
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

A major surface antigen family on human leukocytes includes complement
receptor type 3 (CR3A; also called ITGAM, Mac1, or Mo1), lymphocyte
function-associated (LFA) antigen type 1 (ITGAL; 153370), and p150,95
(ITGAX; 151510). These antigens share a common beta chain (ITGB2;
600065) of 94 kD, linked noncovalently to 1 of 3 alpha chains
distinctive to each. They promote adhesion of granulocytes to each other
and to endothelial cell monolayers. The apparent molecular weight of the
Mo1 alpha chain is 155 to 165 kD, that of the LFA1 alpha subunit is 180
kD, and that of the Leu M5 subunit is 130 to 150 kD. Pierce et al.
(1986) purified human Mo1 to homogeneity from normal granulocytes by
affinity chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) and determined the N-terminal amino acid sequence of its alpha
subunit. The obtained sequence was identical, except for 2 conservative
substitutions, to that of the alpha subunit of Mac1 antigen (Springer et
al., 1985). Furthermore, Pierce et al. (1986) found that the N-terminal
amino acid sequence of the alpha subunit of Mo1 was homologous to the
alpha subunit of IIb/IIIa (607759), a glycoprotein that serves similar
adhesive functions on platelets and is deficient or defective in
Glanzmann thrombasthenia (273800). Patients with a history of recurrent
bacterial infections and an inherited deficiency of all 3 leukocyte
membrane surface antigens are thought to have reduced or absent
synthesis of the common beta subunit of the antigen family; see 116920.

Arnaout et al. (1988) described the isolation and analysis of 2 partial
cDNA clones encoding the alpha subunit of Mo1 in humans and guinea pigs.
A comparison of the coding region of the MO1A gene revealed significant
homology with the carboxyl-terminal portions of the alpha subunits of
fibronectin, vitronectin, and platelet IIb/IIIa receptors.

Corbi et al. (1988) described full-length cDNA clones for the alpha
subunit of Mac1.

Arnaout et al. (1988) reported the complete amino acid sequence as
deduced from cDNA for the human alpha subunit. The protein consists of
1,136 amino acids with a long amino-terminal extracytoplasmic domain, a
26-amino acid hydrophobic transmembrane segment, and a
19-carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain. The alpha subunit is highly
similar in sequence to the alpha subunit of leukocyte p150,95.

MAPPING

By Southern analysis of DNA from hamster-human hybrids, Arnaout et al.
(1988) localized the human MO1A gene to chromosome 16, which has been
shown to contain the ITGAL gene (153370). By in situ hybridization,
Corbi et al. (1988) demonstrated that the genes encoding the alpha
subunits of LFA1 (ITGAL), Mac1, and p150,95 (ITGAX), all of which are
involved in leukocyte adhesion, constitute a cluster on 16p13.1-p11.
Callen et al. (1991) narrowed the assignment to 16p11.2.

GENE FUNCTION

Inflammation plays an essential role in the initiation and progression
of atherosclerosis. Simon et al. (2000) presented evidence that it also
has a role in vascular repair after mechanical arterial injury (i.e.,
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, or PTCA). In animal
models of vascular injury, leukocytes are recruited as a precursor to
intimal thickening. Markers of leukocyte activation, in particular,
increased expression of Mac1, which is responsible for firm leukocyte
adhesion to platelets and fibrinogen on denuded vessels, predict
restenosis after PTCA. To determine whether Mac1-mediated leukocyte
recruitment is causally related to neointimal formation, Simon et al.
(2000) subjected Mac1 knockout mice to a mechanical carotid artery
dilation and complete endothelial denudation. They found that the
selective absence of Mac1 impaired transplatelet leukocyte migration
into the vessel wall, reducing leukocyte accumulation. Diminished medial
leukocyte accumulation was accompanied by markedly reduced neointimal
thickening after vascular injury. These data established a role for
inflammation in neointimal thickening and suggested that leukocyte
recruitment to mechanically injured arteries may prevent restenosis.

Ranganathan et al. (2011) noted that previous work (Cao et al., 2006)
had shown colocalization of low density lipoprotein receptor-related
protein-1 (LRP1; 107770) with integrin alpha-M/beta-2 at the trailing
edge of migrating macrophages and that macrophage migration depended
upon coordinated action of LRP1 and alpha-M/beta-2, as well as tissue
plasminogen activator (PLAT; 173370) and its inhibitor, PAI1 (SERPINE1;
173360). Ranganathan et al. (2011) found that LRP1 specifically bound
integrin alpha-M/beta-2, but not integrin alpha-L/beta-2. Activation of
alpha-M/beta-2 by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) enhanced interaction between
LRP1 and alpha-M/beta-2 in macrophages. Transfection experiments in
HEK293 cells revealed that both the heavy and light chains of LRP1
contributed to alpha-M/beta-2 binding. Within the LRP1 heavy chain,
binding was mediated primarily via ligand-binding motifs 2 and 4. Within
alpha-M, the sequence EQLKKSKTL within the I domain was the major LRP1
recognition site. Exposure of alpha-M/beta-2-expressing HEK293 cells to
soluble LRP1 inhibited cell attachment to fibrinogen (see 134820). Mouse
macrophages lacking Lrp1 were deficient in alpha-M/beta-2
internalization upon LPS stimulation. Ranganathan et al. (2011)
concluded that LRP1 has a role in macrophage migration and that it is
critical for internalization of integrin alpha-M/beta-2.

603398	TITLE *603398 WNT1-INDUCIBLE SIGNALING PATHWAY PROTEIN 1; WISP1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

WNT1 (164820) belongs to a family of cysteine-rich, glycosylated
signaling proteins that mediate diverse developmental processes, such as
control of cell proliferation, adhesion, cell polarity, and
establishment of cell fates. WISP1 is induced by WNT1 and belongs to the
CCN family, which includes connective tissue growth factor (CTGF;
121009), cysteine-rich-61 (CYR61; 602369), and nephroblastoma
overexpressed (NOV; 164958) (Tanaka et al., 2001).

CLONING

Wnt1 was identified as an oncogene activated by the insertion of mouse
mammary tumor virus in virus-induced mammary adenocarcinomas. Although
Wnt1 is not expressed in the normal mammary gland, expression of Wnt1 in
transgenic mice causes mammary tumors. To identify downstream genes in
the WNT signaling pathway that are relevant to the transformed cell
phenotype, Pennica et al. (1998) used a PCR-based cDNA subtraction
strategy, suppression subtractive hybridization. Pennica et al. (1998)
reported the identification of 2 genes, WISP1 and WISP2 (603399), that
were upregulated in the mouse mammary epithelial cell line transformed
by Wnt1, but not by Wnt4 (603490). Together with a third related gene,
WISP3 (603399), these proteins define a subfamily of the CTGF family.
The WISP1 protein contains 367 amino acids. Mouse and human WISP1
proteins are 84% identical, and both have hydrophobic N-terminal signal
sequences, 38 conserved cysteine residues, and 4 potential N-linked
glycosylation sites. Alignment of the 3 human WISP proteins showed that
WISP1 and WISP3 are most similar (42%), whereas WISP2 had 37% identity
with WISP1 and 32% identity with WISP3.

Tanaka et al. (2001) used targeted differential displays to identify a
novel variant of WISP1, designated WISP1v, which was overexpressed in
scirrhous gastric carcinomas. The predicted WISP1v protein completely
lacks a module of von Willebrand factor type C (see 613160) that is
thought to participate in protein complex formation.

GENE FUNCTION

Pennica et al. (1998) found that 2 distinct systems demonstrated that
WISP induction was associated with expression of WNT1. WISP1 genomic DNA
was amplified in colon cancer cell lines and in human colon tumors, and
its RNA was overexpressed in 84% of tumors examined compared with
patient-matched normal mucosa. WISP3 also was overexpressed in 63% of
colon tumors analyzed. In contrast, WISP2 showed reduced RNA expression
in 79% of tumors. These results suggested that WISP genes may be
downstream of WNT1 signaling and that aberrant levels of WISP expression
in colon cancer may play a role in colon tumorigenesis.

Using Northern blot analysis, Xu et al. (2000) detected an increase in
Wisp1 expression in mouse mammary epithelial cells expressing Wnt1 or
stabilized beta-catenin (CTNNB1; 116806) mutants compared with parental
cells. They cloned 5.9 kb of the WISP1 promoter and determined that
WISP1 is a downstream target gene transcriptionally activated by WNT1
and CTNNB1 signaling. T-cell factor (TCF)-lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF;
see 153245)-binding sites played a minor role, whereas the CREB site
played an important role in this transcriptional activation.
Overexpression of WISP1 in normal rat kidney fibroblast cells resulted
in morphologic transformation and growth rate acceleration.
Additionally, these cells formed WISP1-expressing tumors in nude mice.
Xu et al. (2000) hypothesized that WISP1 may contribute to
CTNNB1-mediated tumorigenesis and that elevated WISP1 expression in
human colon adenocarcinomas could be the result of enhanced
CTNNB1-mediated transcription.

Tanaka et al. (2001) found that ectopic expression of WISP1v showed it
to be a secreted oncoprotein that induced a striking cellular
transformation and rapid piling-up growth. They noted that WISP1
transfectants enhanced the invasive phenotype of cocultured gastric
carcinoma cells, while wildtype WISP1 had no such potential.

MAPPING

By use of radiation hybrid mapping panels, Pennica et al. (1998) mapped
the 3 WISP genes. WISP1 was mapped to chromosome 8q24.1-q24.3, roughly 4
Mb distal to MYC (190080). WISP2 was mapped to chromosome 20q12-q13.1,
and WISP3 to chromosome 6q22-q23.

130620	TITLE *130620 RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN S14; RPS14
;;EMETINE RESISTANCE GENE; EMTB
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The mammalian ribosome consists of 4 RNA species (see 180450) and
approximately 80 different proteins. The ribosomal proteins are encoded
by complex gene families that include at least 1 active
intron-containing gene and multiple processed pseudogenes.

Dana and Wasmuth (1982) isolated interspecific hybrids between normal
human leukocytes and a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line that had a
mutation in the EMTB locus, leading to alteration of the 40S ribosomal
protein S14 and, as a result, resistance to the protein synthesis
inhibitor emetine. The cell line was also chromate-resistant due to a
mutation in the CHR gene (118840) and temperature-sensitive because of a
mutation in the leucyl-tRNA synthetase gene (LEUS; 151350). All 3
mutations were recessive in CHO cells. Therefore, human-CHO cell hybrids
were emetine-sensitive, chromate-sensitive, and temperature-resistant.

By screening cDNAs derived from HeLa cell 10S to 12S mRNAs with a CHO
Rps14 cDNA, Rhoads et al. (1986) isolated cDNAs encoding human RPS14.
The deduced 151-amino acid human RPS14 protein is identical to CHO
Rps14. The authors isolated human RPS14 genomic clones using human and
CHO RPS14 cDNAs.

Chen et al. (1986) reported that the RPS14 gene appears to have been
stringently conserved during evolution. They found high similarity
between the C termini of mammalian RPS14 and yeast ribosomal protein 59;
this region includes nucleotides that are mutated in emetine-resistant
CHO cells (Rhoads and Roufa, 1985).

GENE STRUCTURE

Rhoads et al. (1986) determined that the human RPS14 gene contains 5
exons and spans 5.9 kb.

MAPPING

All 3 genes related to emetine resistance isolated by Dana and Wasmuth
(1982) appeared to be linked to the long arm of chromosome 2 in the
Chinese hamster. Dana and Wasmuth (1982) showed that the genes for these
3 characteristics are carried by human chromosome 5. The results showed
that synteny of the 3 genes has been long maintained in evolution. The
EMTB locus, 1 of 3 genes that can be altered to give rise to the
emetine-resistance phenotype, encodes ribosomal protein S14 (Madjar et
al., 1982, Dana et al., 1985). Dana and Wasmuth (1982) subjected Chinese
hamster-human interspecific hybrid cells, which contained human
chromosome 5 and expressed the 4 syntenic genes LEUS, HEXB (606873),
EMTB, and CHR, to selective conditions requiring them to retain the LEUS
gene but lose either the EMTB or CHR gene. Using cytogenetic and
biochemical analyses of spontaneous segregants, which arose primarily by
terminal deletions of various portions of 5q, Dana and Wasmuth (1982)
concluded that the order and specific locations of the linked genes are:
LEUS, 5pter-5q1; HEXB, 5q13; EMTB, 5q23-5q35; and CHR, 5q35. Other
ribosomal protein genes were mapped to chromosomes 8 and 17 by Nakamichi
et al. (1986), using cDNA probes and hamster-human hybrid cells. The
region of chromosome 8 carrying ribosomal protein genes was 8pter-q21.1.
The ribosomal protein genes on chromosome 17 were on the long arm.
Nakamichi et al. (1986) placed the RPS14 gene on the segment 5q23-q33.

Rhoads et al. (1986) mapped a DNA fragment derived from an intron of the
RPS14 gene to 5q23-q33 using somatic cell hybrid DNAs, indicating that
the functional RPS14 gene is located at this locus. Kenmochi et al.
(1998) confirmed the mapping assignment reported by Rhoads et al.
(1986).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Somatic RPS14 Haploinsufficiency Causes 5q Deletion Syndrome

The 5q- syndrome (153550) is a myelodysplastic syndrome subtype
characterized by a defect in erythroid differentiation caused by
recurring somatic deletion of a 1.5-Mb region on chromosome 5q
containing 40 genes. While somatic chromosomal deletions in cancer have
been thought to indicate the location of tumor suppressor genes whose
biallelic inactivation results in cancer, no such biallelic inactivation
had been found in patients with 5q- syndrome. Using an RNA-mediated
interference-based approach, Ebert et al. (2008) found that partial loss
of function of the ribosomal subunit protein RPS14 phenocopied the
disease in normal hematopoietic progenitor cells. Forced expression of
RPS14 rescued the disease phenotype in patient-derived bone marrow
cells. In addition, the authors identified a block in the processing of
preribosomal RNA in RPS14-deficient cells that is functionally
equivalent to the defect in Diamond-Blackfan anemia (105650), linking
the molecular pathophysiology of the 5q- syndrome (the somatic deletion
of one allele of RPS14) to a congenital syndrome causing bone marrow
failure. Ebert et al. (2008) concluded that the 5q- syndrome is caused
by defects in ribosomal protein function and suggested that RNA
interference screening is an effective strategy for identifying causal
haploinsufficiency disease genes.

603408	TITLE *603408 FRIZZLED, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 1; FZD1
;;FZ1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Frizzled proteins, such as FZD1, are 7-transmembrane domain-containing
receptors whose extracellular cysteine-rich domains (CRDs) bind to Wnt
proteins (see 164975). Wnts are secreted cell signaling proteins
involved in development and homeostasis (summary by Zilberberg et al.,
2004).

CLONING

Sagara et al. (1998) cloned fetal lung cDNAs encoding FZD1, FZD2
(600667), and FZD7 (603410). The predicted 647-amino acid FZD1 protein
contains a signal peptide, a CRD in the N-terminal extracellular region,
7 transmembrane domains, and a C-terminal PDZ domain-binding motif. FZD1
shares 77% and 74% protein sequence identity with FZD2 and FZD7,
respectively. Northern blot analysis revealed that FZD1 is expressed as
a 4.5-kb mRNA in various tissues.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Sagara et al. (1998) mapped the
FZD1 gene to 7q21.

GENE FUNCTION

Liu et al. (2001) constructed a chimeric receptor with the
ligand-binding and transmembrane segments from the beta-2-adrenergic
receptor (109690) and the cytoplasmic domains from rat frizzled-1.
Stimulation of mouse F9 clones expressing the chimera with the
beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol stimulated stabilization of
beta-catenin (116806), activation of a beta-catenin-sensitive promoter,
and formation of primitive endoderm. The response was blocked by
inactivation of pertussis toxin-sensitive, heterotrimeric G proteins,
and by depletion of G-alpha-q (600998) and G-alpha-o (139311). Thus, Liu
et al. (2001) concluded that G proteins are elements of Wnt/frizzled-1
signaling to the beta-catenin-lymphoid-enhancer factor (LEF)-T-cell
factor (Tcf) pathway.

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have the ability to renew themselves and
to give rise to all lineages of the blood. Reya et al. (2003) showed
that the WNT signaling pathway has an important role in this process.
Overexpression of activated beta-catenin expands the pool of HSCs in
long-term cultures by both phenotype and function. Furthermore, HSCs in
their normal microenvironment activate a LEF1/TCF (153245) reporter,
which indicates that HSCs respond to WNT signaling in vivo. To
demonstrate the physiologic significance of this pathway for HSC
proliferation, Reya et al. (2003) showed that the ectopic expression of
axin (603816) or a frizzled ligand-binding domain, inhibitors of the WNT
signaling pathway, led to inhibition of HSC growth in vitro and reduced
reconstitution in vivo. Furthermore, activation of WNT signaling in HSCs
induced increased expression of HOXB4 (142965) and NOTCH1 (190198),
genes previously implicated in self-renewal of HSCs. Reya et al. (2003)
concluded that the WNT signaling pathway is critical for normal HSC
homeostasis in vitro and in vivo, and provide insight into a potential
molecular hierarchy of regulation of HSC development.

Zilberberg et al. (2004) noted that members of the low density
lipoprotein receptor family, including LRP5 (603506) and LRP6 (603507),
interact with frizzled receptors and function as Wnt coreceptors. Using
transfected HEK293 cells, they showed that LRP1 (107770), as well as a
C-terminal fragment of LRP1 that mimics the full-length protein, bound
the CRD of human FZ1 and inhibited FZ1-dependent Wnt signaling. LRP1 did
not mediate FZ1 internalization and degradation, but sequestered FZ1 and
inhibited its formation of a functional Wnt signaling complex with LRP6.

607380	TITLE *607380 TRAF3-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1; TRAF3IP1
;;MICROTUBULE-INTERACTING PROTEIN ASSOCIATED WITH TRAF3; MIPT3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using TRAF3 (601896) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen, Ling and
Goeddel (2000) obtained a partial MIPT3 sequence, which they used as
probe to obtain the full-length cDNA from a HeLa cell cDNA library. The
deduced 625-amino acid protein contains a KKE motif and a C-terminal
coiled-coil domain. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of 4.4-
and 2.4-kb transcripts in all tissues examined. Testis also expressed a
2.7-kb transcript. Ling and Goeddel (2000) determined that the 4.4- and
2.4-kb transcripts encode the same open reading frame, with the longer
transcript containing an extra 2 kb of 3-prime untranslated region.
Western blot analysis revealed that endogenous MIPT3 has an apparent
molecular mass of 83 kD.

MAPPING

Scott (2002) mapped the MIPT3 gene to chromosome 2q37.3 based on
sequence similarity between the MIPT3 sequence (GenBank GENBANK
AF230877) and the chromosome 2 clones RP11-7908 (GenBank GENBANK
AC013400) and RP11-40B20 (GenBank GENBANK AC016999).

GENE FUNCTION

Using in vitro pull-down assays and coimmunoprecipitation studies, Ling
and Goeddel (2000) determined that the interaction between MIPT3 and
TRAF3 is specific. MIPT3 did not significantly interact with any other
TRAF family members tested. By in vitro binding studies of truncated
proteins, Ling and Goeddel (2000) found that the interaction required
the coiled-coil TRAF-N domain of TRAF3 and the C-terminal coiled-coil
domain of MIPT3. When expressed separately, both MIPT3 and TRAF3 showed
a cytosolic localization, but when coexpressed, both proteins
colocalized with tubulin (see 191130) in cytoskeletal structures. MIPT3
bound to Taxol-stabilized microtubules and to tubulin in vitro, and
MIPT3 recruited TRAF3 to microtubules when both proteins were
overexpressed in HeLa cells. Mutation analysis of in vitro translated
MIPT3 revealed that the tubulin-binding domain of MIPT3 resides within
the N-terminal region.

Omori et al. (2008) identified elipsa, the zebrafish ortholog of
TRAF3IP1, as a component of intraflagellar transport particles, which
are involved in the formation and function of cilia. Elipsa interacted
with rabaptin-5 (RABEP1; 603616), a regulator of endocytosis, and
rabaptin-5 in turn interacted with Rab8 (RAB8A; 165040), a small GTPase
localized to cilia. Omori et al. (2008) concluded that elipsa,
rabaptin-5, and Rab8 provide a bridge between the intraflagellar
transport particle and protein complexes that assemble at the ciliary
membrane.

For discussion of an association between variation in the TRAF3IP1 gene
and furrow contractions in the iris, see 610744.

Omori et al. (2008) showed that the elipsa mutation in zebrafish caused
an early defect in ciliogenesis that resulted in larvae with a curly
body axis and kidney cysts.

610249	TITLE *610249 PROTEIN O-FUCOSYLTRANSFERASE 2; POFUT2
;;CHROMOSOME 21 OPEN READING FRAME 80; C21ORF80;;
KIAA0958
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Fucose is typically found as a terminal modification of branched chain
glycoconjugates, but it also exists in direct O-linkage to serine or
threonine residues within cystine knot motifs in epidermal growth factor
(EGF; 131530)-like repeats or thrombospondin (THBS; see 188060) type-1
repeats. POFUT2 is an O-fucosyltransferase that use THBS type-1 repeats
as substrates (Luo et al., 2006).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned POFUT2, which they designated
KIAA0958. The deduced protein contains 428 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected moderate expression in all adult and fetal tissues and specific
brain regions examined.

Menzel et al. (2004) identified 3 C21ORF80 splice variants, C21ORF80a,
C21ORF80b, and C21ORF80c, that encode deduced proteins containing 424,
380, and 429 amino acids, respectively. They identified C21ORF80
orthologs in C. elegans, Drosophila, and mouse. Northern blot analysis
revealed ubiquitous expression of a 3-kb C21ORF80 transcript. A weak
2.5-kb transcript was also expressed in brain. RT-PCR detected C21ORF80a
expression in fetal liver and peripheral blood lymphocytes. C21ORF80b
was expressed in spleen, lung, testis, bone marrow, fetal brain, fetal
liver, fetal kidney, thymus, pancreas, and prostate. C21ORF80c was
expressed in brain, heart, spleen, liver, lung, stomach, testis,
placenta, skin, fetal brain, fetal liver, fetal heart, thymus, pancreas,
mammary gland, and prostate. Fluorescence- or epitope-tagged C21ORF80
proteins localized in the cytoplasm of transfected cells and partially
overlapped with a Golgi marker protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Luo et al. (2006) showed that Ofut2, the Drosophila POFUT2 ortholog, is
a predominantly endoplasmic reticulum-localized enzyme that possesses
O-fucosyltransferase activity against THBS type-1 repeats, but not
EGF-like repeats.

GENE STRUCTURE

Menzel et al. (2004) determined that the POFUT2 gene contains 10 exons
and spans more than 24 kb.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1999) mapped the POFUT2
gene to chromosome 21. By genomic sequence analysis, Menzel et al.
(2004) mapped the POFUT2 gene to chromosome 21q22.3, between the ADARB1
(601218) and COL18A1 (120328) genes.

ANIMAL MODEL

Menzel et al. (2004) found that altering the expression of C. elegans
Pad2, the ortholog of C21ORF80, led to severe body malformation and
abnormal neuronal development.

HOXA9/NUP98 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED;;

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

In vertebrates, HOX genes exhibit spatially restricted patterns of
expression coincident with the morphogenesis of body-segmented
structures. The specific combination of HOX genes expressed in a
particular segment determines tissue identity. The HOXA9 gene encodes a
class I homeodomain protein potentially involved in myeloid
differentiation.

CLONING

Kim et al. (1998) cloned the HOXA9 gene and identified several splice
variants. Using exon-specific probes in Northern blot analysis, they
detected a 1.8-kb homeobox-containing transcript in all fetal tissues
tested (brain, lung, liver, and kidney); 2.2- and 3.3-kb transcripts in
fetal and adult kidney and in adult skeletal muscle; and a 1.0-kb
transcript in all adult and fetal tissues tested.

GENE FUNCTION

Vijapurkar et al. (2004) found that mouse Hoxa9 was phosphorylated by
protein kinase C (PKC; see 176960) and more weakly by casein kinase II
(see 115440). PKC phosphorylated Hoxa9 on ser204 and thr205, which are
located within a highly conserved N-terminal sequence (STRK). PKC
phosphorylation on ser204 decreased Hoxa9 DNA binding affinity in vitro
and blocked formation of DNA-binding complexes between endogenous HOXA9
and PBX (176310) in a human hematopoietic cell line. Phorbol ester
induction of myeloid cell differentiation correlated with
phosphorylation of HOXA9 on ser204 and the loss of in vivo DNA binding
activity, suggesting that PKC regulates the role of HOXA9 in myeloid
cell proliferation and differentiation.

Cheng et al. (2005) found that HOX genes, which normally regulate
mullerian duct differentiation, are not expressed in normal ovarian
surface epithelium, but are expressed in epithelial ovarian cancer
subtypes according to the pattern of mullerian-like differentiation of
the cancers. Ectopic expression of Hoxa9 in tumorigenic mouse ovarian
surface epithelial cells gave rise to papillary tumors resembling serous
ovarian cancers. In contrast, Hoxa10 (142957) and Hoxa11 (142958)
induced morphogenesis of endometrioid-like and mucinous-like tumors,
respectively. Hoxa7 (142950) showed no lineage specificity, but promoted
the abilities of Hoxa9, Hoxa10, and Hoxa11 to induce differentiation
along their respective pathways.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kim et al. (1998) determined that the HOXA9 gene contains 3 exons and
spans about 7.2 kb. The upstream region contains 2 TATA boxes, a CAAT
box, a GC box, and body segmentation-specific factor-binding sites. A
CpG island and 2 retinoic acid response elements (RAREs) are located
within intron 1.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Kim et al. (1998) mapped the HOXA9 gene to
chromosome 7p15.

CYTOGENETICS

- HOXA9/NUP98 Fusion Gene

Expression of Hoxa7 (142950) and Hoxa9 is activated by proviral
integration in BXH2 murine myeloid leukemias. This result, combined with
the mapping of the HOXA cluster to 7p15, suggested that one of the HOXA
genes may be involved in the human t(7;11)(p15;p15) translocation found
in some myeloid leukemia patients. Nakamura et al. (1996) showed that in
3 patients with t(7;11), the chromosome rearrangement created a genomic
fusion between the HOXA9 gene and the nucleoporin gene NUP98 (601021), a
member of the GLFG nucleoporin family, on 11p15. The translocation
produced an invariant chimeric NUP98/HOXA9 transcript containing the
N-terminal half of NUP98 fused in-frame to HOXA9. These studies
identified HOXA9 as an important human myeloid leukemia gene and
suggested an important role for nucleoporins in human myeloid leukemia,
given that a second nucleoporin, NUP214 (114350), has also been
implicated in human myeloid leukemia.

Borrow et al. (1996) likewise identified the HOXA9 and NUP98 genes as
the parents of the fusion in t(7;11)(p15;p15) in acute myeloid leukemia
of the FABM2 and M4 types. They suggested that the predicted NUP98/HOXA9
fusion protein may promote leukemogenesis through inhibition of
HOXA9-mediated terminal differentiation and/or aberrant
nucleocytoplasmic transport.

Barr (1996) provided a table listing 9 types of gene fusions occurring
in myeloid leukemia.

- HOXA9/MSI2 Fusion Gene

Barbouti et al. (2003) identified a cryptic balanced translocation in a
chronic myeloid leukemia patient whose disease had progressed to the
accelerated phase and blast crisis. The translocation, t(7;17)(p15;q23),
resulted in a chimeric gene that fused exon 9 of MSI2 (607897) in-frame
with the intermediate exon (exon 1b) of HOXA9. The fusion protein
retained the 2 intact RRM domains of MSI2 fused to the homeobox domain
of HOXA9. The reciprocal HOXA9/MSI2 chimeric protein was not detected.

603706	TITLE *603706 SEMAPHORIN 4F; SEMA4F
;;SEMAPHORIN W; SEMAW;;
SEMAPHORIN M; SEMAM
DESCRIPTION The semaphorins comprise a large family of membrane-bound and secreted
proteins, some of which have been shown to function in axon guidance.
See semaphorin 3F (601124). Encinas et al. (1999) cloned a novel
semaphorin, which they referred to as semaphorin W (SEMAW). Sequence
analysis of the SEMAW gene indicated that SEMAW is a member of the class
IV subgroup of transmembrane semaphorins. The mouse and rat forms of
semaphorin W share 97% amino acid sequence identity, and each shows
approximately 91% identity with the human form. The SEMAW gene contains
15 exons, up to 4 of which were absent in the human cDNAs sequenced by
Encinas et al. (1999). Expression studies showed that SEMAW mRNA is
expressed at high levels in postnatal brain and lung and, unlike many
other semaphorins, at low levels in the developing embryo. Functional
studies showed that semaphorin W can collapse retinal ganglion cell
axons.

By genetic mapping with human/hamster radiation hybrids, Encinas et al.
(1999) mapped the human SEMAW gene to chromosome 2p13. By genetic
mapping with mouse/hamster radiation hybrids, they mapped the mouse
Semaw gene to chromosome 6; physical mapping placed the gene on BACs
carrying microsatellite markers D6Mit70 and D6Mit189. This localization
placed the mouse Semaw gene within the locus for motor neuron
degeneration-2 of mouse, making it an attractive candidate for that
disorder.

606447	TITLE *606447 RNA-BINDING PROTEIN S1; RNPS1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Splicing of mRNA must be highly precise to carry the correct genetic
information to the cytoplasm as templates for translation. On the other
hand, it is also flexible to allow for alternative splicing, which can
permit tissue-specific and physiologically and developmentally
controlled regulation of gene expression. The splicing process involves
more than 50 proteins in the splicing complex, or spliceosome. RNPS1
regulates alternative splicing of a variety of pre-mRNAs.

CLONING

By screening an osteosarcoma cDNA library with a probe encompassing the
osteocalcin (112260) vitamin D response element, followed by probing a
hippocampus cDNA library, Badolato et al. (1995) isolated a cDNA
encoding RNPS1, which they termed E5.1. Sequence analysis predicted that
the 305-amino acid RNPS1 protein has long stretches that are 100%
identical to the mouse protein. RNPS1 has a long N-terminal ser-rich
(SR) region; a 90-residue RNA recognition motif that contains RNP1 and
RNP2 submotifs; an SR splicing protein motif; 2 arg-rich RNA-binding
domains; and a C-terminal nuclear localization signal. Northern blot
analysis revealed ubiquitous expression of a 2.4-kb RNPS1 transcript.
There was no significant change in expression during cell cycle
progression or after treatment with progestin.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

By yeast 2-hybrid, coimmunoprecipitation, and Western blot analyses,
Loyer et al. (1998) showed that the N terminus of the p110 isoform of
PITSLRE (see CDC2L1; 176873), but not other isoforms, interacts with the
N-terminal RNA-binding domain of RNPS1. Immunofluorescence analysis
demonstrated the expression of both proteins in large nuclear speckles.

GENE FUNCTION

Mayeda et al. (1999) showed that expression of RNPS1 synergizes with SR
proteins to strongly activate splicing of constitutively and
alternatively spliced pre-mRNAs.

By Northern blot analysis, Lykke-Andersen et al. (2001) determined that
expression of RNPS1 or UPF3B (300298), and to a lesser extent Y14
(RBM8A; 605313), in the presence of wildtype or dominant-negative UPF1
(RENT1; 601430) marks the mRNA for nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) when
tethered to the 3-prime untranslated region of beta-globin mRNA. This
did not occur with DEK (125264), ALY (604171), or SRM160 (605975).
Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that RNPS1 is a nucleocytoplasmic
shuttling protein. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis indicated high levels
of RNPS1 association with UPF3A (605530), UPF3B (2 splice variants
each), UPF2 (605529), and UPF1. Y14 and TAP (NXF1; 602647) were also
found in the complexes and all assembled at exon-exon junctions.
Lykke-Andersen et al. (2001) concluded that the post-splicing proteins
Y14, RNPS1, and UPF3B remain on the mRNA after binding to the mRNA
export receptor NXF1, while ALY and SRM160 dissociate. If termination
occurs upstream of the last exon-exon junction, mRNA decapping is
triggered followed by rapid NMD.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis with full-length RNPS1 and several deletion
mutants, Sakashita et al. (2004) identified several splicing-related
factors that interacted with the various domains of RNPS1 in HeLa cells.
SFRS11 (600326), pinin (603154), and TRA2B (602719) interacted with the
N-terminal serine-rich domain, the central RNA recognition motif (RRM),
and the C-terminal arginine/serine/proline-rich (RSP) domain of RNPS1,
respectively. Protein-protein binding between RNPS1 and these factors
was verified in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of RNPS1 in HeLa cells
induced exon skipping in a model beta-globin pre-mRNA and human TRA2B
pre-mRNA. Coexpression of RNPS1 and SFRS11 cooperatively stimulated exon
inclusion in an ATP synthase gamma subunit (108729) pre-mRNA. The RSP
domain and RRM were necessary for the exon-skipping activity, whereas
the serine-rich domain was important for the cooperative effect with
SFRS11. Sakashita et al. (2004) concluded that RNPS1 is a versatile
factor that regulates alternative splicing of a variety of pre-mRNAs.

MAPPING

By exon trapping of a P1 contig, Burn et al. (1996) mapped the RNPS1
gene to 16p13.3.

602710	TITLE *602710 AMYLOID BETA A4 PRECURSOR PROTEIN-BINDING, FAMILY B, MEMBER 2; APBB2
;;FE65-LIKE 1; FE65L1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The cytoplasmic domain of the Alzheimer disease locus amyloid protein
precursor (APP; 104760) binds 4 human phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB)
proteins; see APBA1 (602414). By use of a yeast 2-hybrid screening of a
human brain cDNA library, McLoughlin and Miller (1996) identified 3 of
these proteins: the human homolog of Fe65 (APBB1; 602709), an Fe65-like
sequence (APBB2), and an X11-like sequence (APBA2; 602712). From a human
fetal brain cDNA library, Guenette et al. (1996) also cloned APBB2 based
on its interaction with the carboxy terminus of APP. They showed that
the APBB2 protein interacts with another amyloid protein precursor,
APLP2 (104776), but not with APLP1 (104775). The APBB2 gene encodes a
730-amino acid polypeptide that is 51% identical to rat Fe65. Northern
blot analysis revealed that APBB2 has widespread expression in human
tissues.

MAPPING

By use of a radiation hybrid panel, Blanco et al. (1998) mapped the
human APBB2 gene to chromosome 4, between the markers D4S405 (4.6 cR)
and D4S496 (10.1 cR).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Since the APBB2 gene encodes a protein that is capable of binding to
amyloid beta precursor protein (APP), which is central to the
pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (104300), Li et al. (2005) performed a
genetic association study of APBB2 and late-onset Alzheimer disease
(104310) in 3 independently collected case-control series totaling
approximately 2,000 samples. They found that one SNP (dbSNP rs13133980),
located in a region conserved between the human and mouse genomes,
showed a significant interaction with age of disease onset. For this
marker, Li et al. (2005) reported the association with late-onset
Alzheimer disease was most pronounced in subjects with disease onset
before 75 years of age; odds ratio for homozygotes = 2.43 and for
heterozygotes = 2.15.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Apel et al. (2000) isolated a cDNA encoding Syne1 by yeast 2-hybrid
analysis of an embryonic mouse cDNA library using mouse Musk (601296) as
bait. By screening additional mouse cDNA libraries, they identified
cDNAs encoding at least 3 Syne1 variants. Syne1 contains multiple
spectrin repeats and a 60-amino acid C-terminal region homologous to the
Drosophila protein Klarsicht. By database analysis, Apel et al. (2000)
identified KIAA0796 (Nagase et al., 1998) as a partial human ortholog of
Syne1. Northern blot analysis of mouse and human tissues detected a
4.7-kb SYNE1A transcript in skeletal and cardiac muscle and a 10-kb
SYNE1B transcript in multiple tissues, including heart, muscle, kidney,
liver, and brain. RT-PCR analysis showed moderate to high expression of
both transcripts in most human tissues examined. Immunofluorescence on
adult mouse tissues localized Syne1 to nuclei in skeletal, smooth, and
cardiac muscle cells. In skeletal muscle, high levels of expression were
detected in nuclei associated with synaptic sites.

Zhang et al. (2001) obtained a rat Syne1 cDNA that was upregulated in
differentiated aortic vascular smooth muscle cells. By searching
sequence databases using rat Syne1 as probe, followed by PCR and RACE of
human spleen and heart cDNA libraries, Zhang et al. (2001) isolated
human cDNAs encoding 2 SYNE1 proteins, which they called nesprin-1-alpha
and nesprin-1-beta. Nesprin-1-alpha contains 982 amino acids and
nesprin-1-beta contains 3,221 amino acids. They also identified a rare
splice variant of nesprin-1-alpha, nesprin-1-alpha-2, that contains an
additional 31 amino acids at its N terminus. Both nesprin-1 proteins
contain multiple spectrin repeats, a bipartite nuclear localization
signal, a transmembrane domain within the C-terminal Klarsicht homology
(KASH) region, and several N-glycosylation and phosphorylation sites.
Nesprin-1-beta also contains a protein-DNA binding motif. Northern blot
analysis detected ubiquitous expression of 3.8- and 10.7-kb transcripts,
with highest levels in spleen, peripheral blood leukocytes, and heart.
Immunogold and immunofluorescence analyses localized nesprin-1 primarily
to the nuclear envelope, with occasional nuclear staining showing
colocalization with heterochromatin and the nucleolus.

By genomic sequence analysis, RT-PCR, and RACE, Zhang et al. (2002)
extended the sequence of SYNE1 and showed that it encodes an 8,797-amino
acid protein with an actin-binding region containing 2 tandem calponin
(see 600806) homology domains at its N terminus. They also identified
SYNE1 homologs in Drosophila and C. elegans. Zhang et al. (2002)
generated antibody to the newly identified N-terminal portion of SYNE1
and showed that SYNE1 localized to the sarcomeres of cardiac and
skeletal muscle.

Cottrell et al. (2004) identified 2 brain-specific splice variants of
rat Syne1, which they called Cpg2 and Cpg2b, that encode proteins of 941
and 965 amino acids, respectively. The 3-prime UTR of Cpg2 contains an
unspliced intron between exons 33 and 34 of the Syne1 gene, and exon 34
is followed by a noncanonical polyadenylation hexamer that is conserved
in rats and humans. Compared with Cpg2, Cpg2b has an additional exon at
its 5-prime end. RT-PCR detected the 2 Cpg2 transcripts only in rat
brain. Immunohistochemical analysis localized Cpg2 to the postsynaptic
side of excitatory synapses on rat glutamatergic neurons.

GENE FUNCTION

Using fusion proteins, Zhang et al. (2001) determined that SYNE1
requires its C-terminal transmembrane domain to localize to the nuclear
envelope. When the transmembrane domain was deleted, the remaining
C-terminal domain directed nuclear targeting.

Cottrell et al. (2004) found that RNA interference-mediated knockdown of
Cpg2 in cultured rat hippocampal neurons increased the number of
postsynaptic clathrin-coated vesicles, some of which trafficked
NMDA-type glutamate receptors (see GRIN1; 138249), disrupted
constitutive internalization of glutamate receptors, and inhibited
activity-induced internalization of synaptic AMPA-type glutamate
receptors (see GRIA1; 138247). Manipulating Cpg2 levels also affected
dendritic spine size. Cottrell et al. (2004) concluded that CPG2 is a
component of a specialized postsynaptic endocytic mechanism devoted to
internalization of synaptic proteins, including glutamate receptors.

Puckelwartz et al. (2009) noted that nesprins, including nesprin-1,
participate in a complex that links the nucleoskeleton to the
cytoskeleton (LINC). Longer nesprin isoforms with actin-binding domains
reside in the outer nuclear membrane, while short nesprin isoforms are
tethered to the inner nuclear membrane. The transmembrane KASH domain is
required for tethering to the nuclear membrane, and the luminal portion
of the KASH domain binds to SUN1 (607723) and SUN2 (613569). Both SUN
proteins and nesprin can interact with lamins (LMNA; 150330) at the
inner nuclear membrane.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhang et al. (2002) determined that the SYNE1 gene contains 147 exons
and spans 550 kb.

MAPPING

By FISH, Zhang et al. (2001) mapped the SYNE1 gene to chromosome 6q25.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Spinocerebellar Ataxia 8

Gros-Louis et al. (2007) mapped a candidate interval for a pure form of
autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia (ARCA1, or SCAR8; 610743) to
chromosome 6q using genomewide linkage analysis. The candidate interval
contained only 1 gene, SYNE1, which spans over 0.5 Mb of genomic DNA.
Direct sequencing of SYNE1 identified 2 disease-segregating
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were not detected among 380
age- and ethnicity-matched control chromosomes. This observation led
Gros-Louis et al. (2007) to believe that these 2 variants may be
causative mutations for ARCA1. The first mutation affected the invariant
A of the AG splice acceptor site at the junction of exon 85 and intron
84 (608441.0001), and the second mutation was located in intron 81, 12
bp upstream of exon 82 (608441.0002), creating a new AG cryptic splice
acceptor site. RT-PCR and sequencing analysis showed that the detected
intronic mutations had functional consequences on the proper splicing of
the gene and resulted in premature termination of the protein. Based on
the haplotype reconstructions of affected individuals from all of the
other families, they identified 3 other different disease haplotypes,
suggesting that other mutations could be associated with the disease. A
second mutational screen by direct sequencing uncovered 3 additional
mutations that segregated with their respective haplotypes and were all
predicted to lead to premature termination of the protein: R2906X
(608441.0003), a 5-bp deletion (608441.0004), and Q7640X (608441.0005).
These additional mutations were not detected among the 380 age- and
ethnicity-matched control chromosomes. Because they had identified 5
different mutations in a relatively homogeneous population, Gros-Louis
et al. (2007) predicted that mutations in this gene may be responsible
for a substantial fraction of all adult-onset autosomal recessive ataxia
syndromes with cerebellar atrophy.

- Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy 4

In 2 unrelated probands with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD4;
612998), Zhang et al. (2007) identified 2 different heterozygous
mutations in the SYNE1 gene (R257H; 608441.0008 and E646K; 608441.0010).
Patient fibroblasts and muscle cells showed loss of nuclear envelope
integrity with mislocalization of LMNA and emerin (EMD; 300384).
Immunofluorescent studies showed loss of SYNE1 expression in the nuclear
envelope and mitochondria of patient fibroblasts. These same changes
were also observed in fibroblasts from patients with other genetic forms
of EDMD, indicating that loss of nesprin is a characteristic of all
forms of EDMD. RNA interference of SYNE1 recapitulated the nuclear
defects membrane defects and changes in the organization of intranuclear
heterochromatin observed in patient cells. Overall, the findings showed
the importance of the nesprin/emerin/lamin complex in the maintenance of
nuclear stability and suggested that changes in the binding
stoichiometry of these proteins is a feature of EDMD. Zhang et al.
(2007) concluded that the disorder is caused in part by uncoupling of
the nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton and postulated a dominant-negative
effect of the SYNE1 mutations.

Attali et al. (2009) reported an autosomal recessive form of congenital
muscular dystrophy, which they described as a myogenic arthrogryposis,
in members of a consanguineous Palestinian family. The disorder was
characterized by bilateral clubfoot, decreased fetal movements,
hypotonia, delayed motor milestones, and progressive motor decline after
the first decade. Muscle biopsies in affected individuals revealed
variation in size of muscle fibers without necrosis or fibrosis.
Genomewide linkage analysis revealed a single locus on chromosome 6q25.
Sequence analysis of the SYNE1 gene identified homozygosity for a splice
site mutation (608441.0011) in affected family members.

ANIMAL MODEL

Puckelwartz et al. (2009) generated mice with C-terminal deletion of
Syne1, including the KASH domain. Mice homozygous for this mutation died
at or near birth from respiratory failure, whereas surviving mice
displayed hindlimb weakness and an abnormal gait. With increasing age,
kyphoscoliosis, muscle pathology, and cardiac conduction defects
developed. The protein components of the LINC complex, including mutant
nesprin-1-alpha, lamin A/C, and Sun2 (Unc84b), were localized at the
nuclear membrane in mutant mouse skeletal muscle myofibers; however,
mutant nesprin-1 interaction with Sun2 was disrupted in primary
myoblasts, resulting from loss of the C-terminal KASH domain. The
findings demonstrated the role of the LINC complex and nesprin-1 in
EDMD.

Zhang et al. (2009) showed that Sun1 and Sun2 double-knockout (Sun1/2
DKO) mice and Syne1 and Syne2 (608442) double-knockout (Syne1/2 DKO)
mice had similar defects in brain development. Sun1/2 DKO and Syne1/2
DKO brains were small and showed defective laminary structures in many
brain regions. Examination of neocortex revealed failure of radial
neuronal migration, but not tangential migration of interneurons, in
both Sun1/2 DKO and Syne1/2 DKO mice. Intracellular movement of nuclei
is a prerequisite for proper neuron migration and development, and Zhang
et al. (2009) found that Sun1 and Sun2 anchored Syne2 to the nuclear
envelope, while Syne1 and Syne2 connected the nuclear envelope to the
microtubule network, permitting nuclear movement. Zhang et al. (2009)
concluded that a complex made up of SUN1, SUN2, SYNE1, and SYNE2 is
required for neuronal nuclear movement and for neuronal migration and
development.

Zhang et al. (2010) generated a mouse model in which all isoforms of
nesprin-1 containing the C-terminal spectrin-repeat region with or
without the KASH domain were ablated. Syne1-knockout mice were marked by
decreased survival rates, growth retardation and increased variability
in body weight. Additionally, nuclear positioning and anchorage were
dysfunctional in skeletal muscle from Syne1-knockout mice. Physiologic
testing demonstrated no significant reduction in stress production in
nesprin-1-deficient skeletal muscle in either neonatal or adult mice,
but a significantly lower exercise capacity in knockout mice. Nuclear
deformation testing revealed ineffective strain transmission to nuclei
in muscle fibers lacking nesprin-1. Zhang et al. (2010) concluded that
nesprin-1 is essential for normal positioning and anchorage of nuclei in
skeletal muscle.

SYNE1, IVS84AS, A-G, -2

In affected members of French Canadian families, originating from the
Beauce and Bas-St-Laurent regions of the province of Quebec, Gros-Louis
et al. (2007) found that adult-onset autosomal recessive cerebellar
ataxia (610743) was associated with homozygous mutation in the SYNE1
gene that affected the invariant A of the AG splice acceptor site at the
junction of exon 85 and intron 84 (310067A-G).

.0002
SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 8

In affected individuals with autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia type
1, or recessive ataxia of Beauce (610743), Gros-Louis et al. (2007)
found that the disorder was associated with homozygous mutation in
intron 81 of the SYNE1 gene, 12 bp upstream of exon 82 (306434A-G),
creating a new AG cryptic splice acceptor site.

Dupre et al. (2007) found that the IVS81-2A-G mutation was the most
common mutation among 124 French Canadian patients with SCA8, present at
a frequency of 50.8%.

In a man with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD4; 612998), Zhang
et al. (2007) identified a heterozygous 966G-A transition in exon 6 of
the SYNE1 gene, resulting in an arg257-to-his (R257H) substitution in
the second spectrin repeat. He became wheelchair-bound at age 26 years
but had no cardiac involvement. The mutation was not found in 384
control alleles.

.0009
EMERY-DREIFUSS MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY 4
SYNE1, VAL572LEU

In a patient with a severe form of EDMD4 (612988), Zhang et al. (2007)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations: a 1910G-T
transversion in exon 12 of the SYNE1 gene, resulting in a val572-to-leu
(V572L) substitution, and a T89M mutation in the SYNE2 gene
(608442.0001). In vitro functional expression studies showed that V572L
protein bound more strongly to emerin (EMD; 300384) than wildtype SYNE1.
The variant was not found in 384 control alleles. However, the patient's
unaffected father was heterozygous for the V572L substitution, casting
doubt on the pathogenicity of the V572L variant. The patient had
muscular dystrophy combined with severe dilated cardiomyopathy requiring
heart transplant at age 26.

in a glu646-to-lys (E646K) substitution in the third spectrin repeat.
The mutation was not found in 384 control alleles. The phenotype was
mild and characterized by asymptomatic moderately increased serum
creatine kinase.

.0011
EMERY-DREIFUSS MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY 4 WITH VARIABLE FEATURES
SYNE1, IVS136AS, A-G, -2

In 2 members of a consanguineous Palestinian family with features of
EDMD4 (612988), Attali et al. (2009) identified homozygosity for an
acceptor splice site mutation 2 basepairs 5-prime to exon 137 in the
SYNE1 gene (IVS136-2A-G), which was predicted to result in retention of
intron 136 in mRNA, generating a premature stop codon and loss of the
C-terminal transmembrane KASH domain. The disorder was characterized by
bilateral clubfoot, decreased fetal movements, hypotonia, delayed motor
milestones, and progressive motor decline after the first decade. Muscle
biopsies in affected individuals revealed variation in size of muscle
fibers without necrosis or fibrosis. Attali et al. (2009) described the
disorder as a myogenic arthrogryposis.

300873	TITLE *300873 GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE-BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE 3-LIKE PROTEIN; GNL3L
;;GNL3-LIKE PROTEIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database analysis and RT-PCR of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Du et al.
(2006) cloned GNL3L, a putative human ortholog of yeast Grn1. Both Grn1
and GNL3L have at least 4 circularly permuted GTPase motifs and a
C-terminal RG stretch predicted to bind RNA. Fluorescence-tagged Grnl
and GNL3L localized predominantly to nucleoli of yeast and COS-7 cells,
respectively.

Meng et al. (2011) noted that the 582-amino acid human GNL3L protein
contains an N-terminal basic region, followed by a basic coiled-coil
domain, a GTP-binding domain, an intermediate region, and a C-terminal
domain. It also has a nucleolar localization signal.

GENE FUNCTION

Du et al. (2006) found that knockout of Grn1 expression in fission yeast
resulted in growth arrest, failure of cytokinesis, impaired pre-rRNA
processing, and nucleolar accumulation of the ribosomal protein Rpl25a.
When expressed from the yeast Grn1 promoter, human GNL3L completely
complemented Grn1 deletion. Knockdown of GNL3L expression in HeLa cells
also reduced cell proliferation. Du et al. (2006) hypothesized that Grn1
and GNL3L are involved in early 5-prime pre-rRNA processing and/or
assembly and export of precursor ribonucleoprotein complexes from the
nucleolus.

Meng et al. (2011) found that knockdown of GNL3L in human cell lines
triggered G2/M arrest and upregulation of the p53 (TP53; 191170) targets
BAX (600040), 14-3-3-sigma (SFN; 601290), and p21 (CDKN1A; 116899).
Coimmunoprecipitation analysis revealed that GNL3L bound directly to and
stabilized MDM2 (164785), a protein that regulates p53 ubiquitination
and proteasome-mediated degradation. GNL3L interacted with MDM2 in the
nucleoplasm and stabilized MDM2 under basal conditions against its
ubiquitination and degradation. In contrast, the GNL3L paralog
nucleostemin (GNL3; 608011) interacts with and stabilizes MDM2 during
cell cycle counting or following cell stress only. However, depletion of
nucleostemin induced a compensatory upregulation of GNL3L in both
p53-expressing and p53-null HCT116 cells. Meng et al. (2011) concluded
that GNL3L is a constitutive regulator of MDM2 stability.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the GNL3L gene to chromosome Xp11.22 based on an
alignment of the GNL3L sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK001475) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Claudins, such as CLDN4, are components of epithelial cell tight
junctions. Tight junctions regulate movement of solutes and ions through
the paracellular space and prevent mixing of proteins and lipids in the
outer leaflet of the apical and basolateral plasma membrane domains
(Acharya et al., 2004).

CLONING

The enterotoxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium perfringens is a
simple protein with a molecular mass of approximately 35 kD. Known as a
causative agent of diarrhea, it elicits fluid accumulation in the
intestinal tract by altering the membrane permeability of intestinal
epithelial cells. Pore formation in the cytoplasmic membrane is accepted
as the underlying mechanism of this effect. The cytotoxic action of C.
perfringens enterotoxin (CPE) requires its binding to specific
receptors. At least 2 molecules with different affinities to CPE are
considered to exist in various organs of a wide range of species. By
searching an expressed sequence tag database for sequences showing
homology to the high-affinity CPE receptor (CPER) of monkey kidney
cells, Katahira et al. (1997) identified an infant human brain cDNA
encoding CPETR1. The deduced 209-amino acid protein contains 4 putative
transmembrane domains. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues detected
abundant Cpetr1 expression in small intestine and kidney, and lower
levels in heart, lung, liver, and skeletal muscle; no expression was
found in brain or spleen. In situ hybridization demonstrated that the
expression of mouse Cpetr1 mRNA in the small intestine was restricted to
cryptic enterocytes, indicating that the receptor is expressed in
intestinal epithelial cells.

Using Northern blot analysis, Paperna et al. (1998) found a 1.8-kb
CPETR1 transcript in adult and fetal human tissues. Expression was
highest in adult thyroid, placenta, pancreas, lung, and kidney, and
moderate in small intestine. Little to no CPETR1 was detected in other
adult tissues examined. CPETR1 was detected in fetal lung and kidney,
but not in fetal brain or liver. In whole embryonic mice, expression was
low on embryonic day 7 and increased during development to embryonic day
17.

By sequence analysis, Morita et al. (1999) determined that CPER is a
member of the claudin family and designated it claudin-4.

GENE FUNCTION

Katahira et al. (1997) confirmed that CPETR1 is a functional
high-affinity receptor for CPE.

Using immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy, Morita et al.
(1999) found that claudin-4 localized specifically to tight junctions in
mouse kidney.

By immunofluorescence microscopy of normal mouse skin, Furuse et al.
(2002) found that Cldn1 (603718) and Cldn4 concentrated within
continuous tight junctions in the stratum granulosum.

Coyne et al. (2003) determined that human bronchi and bronchioles
express CLDN1, CLDN3 (602910), CLDN4, CLDN5 (602101), and CLDN7
(609131). CLDN1 and CLDN4 localized to the apical tight junction region
and in lateral intercellular junctions, with staining surrounding basal
cells that anchor the columnar epithelium to the basal lamina. In
contrast, CLDN3 and CLDN5 localized exclusively to the apical-most
region of the tight junction. CLDN7 colocalized with ZO1 (TJP1; 601009)
in lateral intercellular junctions, with little or no staining near
tight junctions.

Using immunofluorescence microscopy, Acharya et al. (2004) showed that
Cldn4, Cldn8 (611231), and Cldn12 (611232) localized to the bladder
epithelium of rat, mouse, and rabbit. These claudins specifically
localized to tight junctions of the superficial umbrella cell layer,
consistent with the high-resistance, low-permeability barrier function
of this cell type.

Using immunohistochemical analysis, Dube et al. (2007) found that CLDN1,
CLDN3, CLDN4, and CLDN8 were associated with the blood-epididymal
barrier of the epididymal duct. In all 3 epididymal segments, CLDN1,
CLDN3, and CLDN4 localized to tight junctions, along the lateral margins
of adjacent principal cells, and at the interface between basal and
principal cells. In contrast, CLDN8 localized to tight junctions in all
3 segments, along the lateral margins of principal cells in the caput,
and at the interface between basal and principal cells in the corpus.

GENE STRUCTURE

Paperna et al. (1998) determined that CLDN4 is an intronless gene.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis, Paperna et al. (1998) mapped the CLDN4
gene to chromosome 7q11.23. They mapped the mouse Cldn4 gene to a region
of chromosome 5G1 that shares homology of synteny with human chromosome
7q11.23.

300474	TITLE *300474 GLYCEROL KINASE; GK
;;ATP:GLYCEROL PHOSPHOTRANSFERASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Glycerol kinase (EC 2.7.1.30) catalyzes the phosphorylation of glycerol
by ATP, yielding ADP and glycerol-3-phosphate.

CLONING

Sargent et al. (1993) isolated and sequenced cDNA clones from a human
adult testis cDNA library to produce expressed sequence tags (ESTs).
Using these ESTs to search DNA and protein sequence databases, Sargent
et al. (1993) isolated a cDNA clone that showed 60% identity to the
Bacillus subtilis glycerol kinase gene at both the DNA and amino acid
sequence levels. Analysis of DNA from somatic cell hybrids carrying
deleted X chromosomes showed that this clone detected homologous
sequences between Xp22.1-p21.2, the interval containing the locus
responsible for glycerol kinase deficiency (307030). In a commentary,
Willard (1993) pointed out the usefulness of the EST strategy for
cataloging new genes. Sargent et al. (1994) reported that Northern
analysis showed expression of GK transcripts of 3 sizes in a wide range
of adult tissues. Only the smallest hybridizing species was present in
testis, where it occurred at an elevated level.

Simultaneously and independently, Walker et al. (1993) used positional
cloning to isolate the human Xp21 GK gene. Using exon amplification
products prepared from Xp21.3 cosmids mapping in the 50- to 250-kb GK
critical region, according to the method of Buckler et al. (1991),
Walker et al. (1993) screened a fetal liver cDNA library and identified
6 overlapping clones that encoded a partial predicted 395-amino acid
protein with significant homology to the bacterial GK protein. Northern
blot analysis showed 3 GK mRNA transcript sizes of 1.85, 2.7, and 3.7
kb. Expression of the GK gene was found in several human tissues,
including skeletal muscle, kidney, and brain, with the highest
expression in liver.

Guo et al. (1993) stated that the methods for screening total human DNA
or YAC and cosmid clones for expressed sequences include interspecies
cross-hybridization ('zoo blots'), CpG island mapping, homologous
recombination, hybridization of cDNAs to genomic clones, evaluation of
nuclear RNA from somatic cell hybrids, exon trapping, hybridization of
genomic (YAC) DNA to cDNA libraries, and random cDNA sequencing. These
methods suffer from low efficiency and high background. Guo et al.
(1993) described an efficient, sensitive and specific method for
identifying genes which they referred to as cDNA amplification for
identification of genomic expressed sequences (CAIGES). The approach
combined PCR, for nonspecific amplification of cDNA library inserts,
with hybridization of the amplified and labeled cDNAs to Southern blots
of cloned genomic material blocked with placental DNA. When a genomic
restriction fragment is identified by hybridization with the amplified
cDNA library, the fragment is used to select the corresponding cDNA
clone and can be subcloned and sequenced for identification of exons.
Using the CAIGES approach, Guo et al. (1993) were able to clone the
entire human hepatic GK cDNA coding sequence, beginning with a cosmid
from the GK 'critical region' of Xp21. Corroboration of the identity of
the gene was obtained by functional complementation of GK-deficient E.
coli mutants. The cDNA encodes a 524-amino acid protein with 62% and 77%
similarity to the E. coli and B. subtilis GK proteins.

Mahbubul Huq et al. (1996) presented the sequence of a full-length mouse
Gyk cDNA that is alternatively spliced in brain. Transient transfection
of cDNA into COS-7 cells caused a marked elevation in glycerol kinase
activity, confirming the functional identity of the cDNA.

GENE STRUCTURE

By analysis of cosmid and YAC clones, Sargent et al. (1994) showed that
the GK1 locus on Xp21.3 is more than 50 kb long and comprises at least
19 exons. In contrast, the remaining members of the glycerol kinase gene
family, located on chromosomes 1, 4, and Xq, appear to be intronless.

Sjarif et al. (1998) found 2 differences from the previously reported
sequence. They demonstrated that exon 9 actually consists of 2 exons
separated by an intron of 392 basepairs, increasing the number of exons
of the GK gene from 19 to 20. Sjarif et al. (1998) also demonstrated 3
nucleotide differences in exon 19 as compared to the sequence published
by Sargent et al. (1994).

Sargent et al. (2000) identified an additional 18-bp exon between exons
8 and 9, thus bringing the total number of exons to 21.

MAPPING

Sargent et al. (1994) determined that the X-linked human glycerol kinase
gene maps to Xp21.3.

Mahbubul Huq et al. (1996) mapped the mouse Gyk gene to the mouse X
chromosome by both fluorescence in situ hybridization and an
interspecies backcross demonstrating conservation of synteny with dmd
(310200).

- Pseudogenes

Sargent et al. (1994) determined that the human glycerol kinase gene
family consists of at least 6 genomic loci, 4 of which encode expressed
sequences. They identified 2 different testis transcripts, both of which
are encoded by chromosome 4. The genes on Xq and chromosome 1 were
thought to be pseudogenes; the gene on chromosome 4 is processed and
expressed. The authors suggested that these sequences probably arose
through reverse transcriptase mediated events. By fluorescence in situ
hybridization, the 2 chromosome 4 loci were positioned at 4q13 and 4q32
(see 600148 and 600149); the pseudogenes were located at 1q41 and Xq23.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Sargent et al. (1993) found that the cDNA sequence corresponding to the
GK gene was deleted in 2 patients with glycerol kinase deficiency.

In 4 patients with isolated glycerol kinase deficiency, Walker et al.
(1996) identified 3 different mutations in the GK gene
(300474.0001-300474.0003). The authors noted widely differing phenotypes
and suggested ascertainment bias; metabolic or environmental stress as a
precipitating factor in revealing GK-related changes, as had previously
been described in juvenile GK deficiency; and interactions with
functional polymorphisms in other genes that alter the effect of GK
deficiency on normal development.

In 3 families with isolated glycerol kinase deficiency, Sjarif et al.
(1998) identified 3 mutations in the GK gene (300474.0004-300474.0006).
There were no apparent genotype/phenotype correlations in these
families.

Sargent et al. (2000) described mutations In 5 children with glycerol
kinase deficiency, Sargent et al. (2000) identified 5 mutations in the
GK gene: 2 nonsense mutations, 1 insertion, and an amino acid
substitution. There was no correlation between the nature of the
mutation and the spectrum of phenotypic variation. Phenotypic variation
was observed in 2 families in which more than 1 affected subject carried
the same mutation, confirming previous studies suggesting that there is
no correlation between disease severity and genotype.

Isolated GKD can be either symptomatic with episodic metabolic and CNS
decompensation or asymptomatic with hyperglycerolemia and glyceroluria
only. Dipple et al. (2001) studied individuals with point mutations in
the GK coding region. Six had missense mutations: 4 in males who were
asymptomatic and 2 in individuals who were symptomatic. GK activity
measured in lymphoblastoid cell lines or fibroblasts was similar for the
symptomatic and the asymptomatic individuals. Mapping of the missense
mutations to the 3-dimensional structure of E. coli GK showed that the
symptomatic individuals' mutations were in the same region as a subset
of the mutations among the asymptomatic individuals, i.e., adjacent to
the active-site cleft. Dipple et al. (2001) concluded that, like many
other disorders, GK genotype does not predict GKD phenotype. They
proposed that GKD is a complex trait influenced by additional,
independently inherited genetic factors.

ANIMAL MODEL

Mahbubul Huq et al. (1997) generated glycerol kinase-deficient mice by
targeted disruption. Mutant male mice appeared normal at birth, but
exhibited postnatal growth retardation, altered fat metabolism with
profound hyperglycerolemia and elevated free fatty acids, autonomous
glucocorticoid synthesis, and death by 3 to 4 days of age. Heterozygous
females were healthy and biochemically normal.

Using microarray analysis, Rahib et al. (2007) examined global gene
expression profiles of GK-null and wildtype mice and detected 668
differentially expressed genes, including genes involved in lipid
metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, insulin signaling, and insulin
resistance. The authors suggested that glycerol kinase deficiency may
play a role in insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (125853).

GK, IVS6AS, G-C, -1

In a 61-year-old male of Belgian origin, referred for 'refractory
hypertriglyceridemia,' Walker et al. (1996) identified a G-to-C
transversion in the last nucleotide of intron 6, resulting in a splice
site mutation causing premature termination of the GK protein. His
general health was good despite GK deficiency (307030).

In 2 brothers with glycerol kinase deficiency (307030), Walker et al.
(1996) identified a deletion of exon 17 in the GK gene. The older
brother had a severe phenotype with psychomotor retardation and growth
delay, bone dysplasias, and seizures. whereas his younger brother had
relatively normal development at age 3 years. In the cDNA sequence,
Walker et al. (1996) found that exon 16 was spliced directly to the
penultimate exon 18 as a result of deletion of exon 17.

In a child with glycerol kinase deficiency (307030) who presented with
metabolic acidosis in the first week of life, Sjarif et al. (1998)
reported a deletion in the GK gene of at least 20 kb extending from exon
9 to at least the 3-prime end of the gene. His maternal grandfather and
2 cousins, who carried the same genetic and biochemical defect, had
either minimal or no symptoms.

In a boy with glycerol kinase deficiency (307030) who presented at 10
months of age with generalized seizures and psychomotor delay, Sjarif et

Zhang et al. (2000) reported the case of a male with benign isolated
glycerol kinase deficiency (307030) who was incidentally identified
after observation of pseudohypertriglyceridemia at the age of 36 years.
DNA sequencing of the GK gene showed insertion of an AluY sequence in
intron 4 (IVS4-52ins316alu) of the glycerol kinase gene. Although Alu
insertions had been implicated in other disorders, and a closely related
AluY element had been found as an insert in the C1 inhibitor gene
(606860) in patients with hereditary angioedema (106100), this was the
first case of glycerol kinase deficiency caused by an Alu insertion.

In 5 French-Canadian families in which 18 males had severe
hyperglycerolemia (307030) in an X-linked pattern of inheritance, Gaudet

10 of the GK gene.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The BCAM gene encodes a glycoprotein expressed on cell surfaces. It is a
member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of receptors and cell adhesion
molecules. When expressed on erythrocytes, BCAM constitutes the Lutheran
(Lu) and Auberger (Au) blood group antigens (111200) (Parsons et al.,
1997; Karamatic Crew et al., 2007).

CLONING

Parsons et al. (1995) isolated glycoproteins expressing the Lutheran
blood group antigens from human erythrocyte membranes and from human
fetal liver. They isolated cDNA clones corresponding to the protein from
a human placental lambda-gt11 library. The deduced 597-residue protein
was found to be a type I membrane protein with 5 potential
N-glycosylation sites. There were 5 disulfide-bonded, extracellular,
immunoglobulin superfamily domains (2 variable-region set and 3
constant-region set), a single hydrophobic, membrane-spanning domain,
and a cytoplasmic domain of 59 residues. The overall structure was
similar to that of the human tumor marker MUC18 (155735) and the chicken
neural adhesion molecule SC1. The extracellular domains and cytoplasmic
domain contained consensus motifs with a binding of integrin and SRC
homology 3 domains, respectively, suggesting possible receptor and
signal-transduction functions. Immunostaining of human tissues showed a
wide distribution and provided evidence that the glycoprotein is under
developmental control in liver, and may also be regulated during
differentiation in other tissues.

Rahuel et al. (1996) reported that 2 previously described cDNA clones,
the Lutheran cDNA clone described by Parsons et al. (1995) and the BCAM
cDNA clone described by Campbell et al. (1994), represented
alternatively spliced transcripts of the same gene on chromosome
19q13.2-q13.3. The structure and tissue distribution of these mRNA
spliceoforms were consistent with immunocharacterization of 2 active
glycoproteins, Lu and BCAM, in various cells. Rahuel et al. (1996) found
that the predominant isoform of the Lutheran glycoprotein in most normal
tissues is an 85-kD glycoprotein corresponding to the full-length BCAM
cDNA. However, the minor 78-kD spliceoform can also be identified in
erythrocyte membranes. The smaller isoform differs from the larger
Lutheran glycoprotein in that it lacks most of the cytoplasmic domain.

El Nemer et al. (1997) isolated the human LU gene by cloning a 20-kb
HindIII fragment from genomic DNA from an individual with Lu(a-b+).
Alternative splicing of intron 13 generated 2.5- and 4.0-kb transcript
spliceoforms encoding the long-tail and the short-tail Lu polypeptides,
respectively.

Parsons et al. (2001) cloned and characterized mouse Lu. The human and
mouse proteins share 72% sequence identity and both bind laminin-10/11
with high affinity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Parsons et al. (1997) determined that the BCAM gene contains 15 exons
and spans approximately 11 kb. El Nemer et al. (1997) reported that the
BCAM gene contains 15 exons distributed over 12.5 kb.

MAPPING

The Lutheran blood group antigen was the first autosomal linkage
demonstrated in man, by Dr. Jan Mohr (1951) in Copenhagen, using
Penrose's sib-pair method. Lutheran and Secretor (Se; see FUT2, 182100)
were known to be linked (review by Cook, 1965). FUT2 has since been
mapped to chromosome 19q.

Gedde-Dahl et al. (1984) found linkage of Se and APOE (107741), which is
on 19q13. A peak lod score of 3.3 was obtained at recombination fraction
0.08 in males and 1.36 at 0.22 in females. Linkage of APOE and Lu
yielded a lod score 4.52 in sexes combined. C3 (120700)-APOE linkage
gave a lod score of 4.0 at theta 0.18 in males but 0.04 at theta 0.45 in
females. Triple heterozygote families confirmed that APOE is on the Se
side and on the Lu side of C3. A summarizing map was given (their Figure
3).

Lewis et al. (1988) demonstrated that APOC2 (608083), Lu, and Se
constitute a tightly linked gene cluster and concluded that Lu and Se
are on chromosome 19q.

Parsons et al. (2001) mapped the mouse Lu gene to a region on chromosome
7 showing conserved synteny with human chromosome 19q13.2.

- Auberger System

Whitehouse et al. (1988) showed that the Au blood group is genetically
independent from the locus for the Kell blood group (KEL; 110900) and
the loci for C3, C6, Gc, HLA, PI, and Gm groups.

Evidence that the Auberger antigens are in the Lutheran system came from
the fact that they are located on the glycoproteins that carry Lutheran
determinants and that they show the same linkage relationships to
markers on chromosome 19 (Zelinski et al., 1990).

GENE FUNCTION

Although the Au(a) antigen was found by Salmon et al. (1961), the
antithetical antigen, Au(b), was not found until 1989 (Frandson et al.,
1989). Daniels et al. (1991) showed that the Au(a) and Au(b) antigens
belong to the Lutheran system.

Rahuel et al. (1996) noted that the BCAM antigen was first identified by
monoclonal antibodies raised against human tumor cells and was shown to
be overexpressed in ovarian carcinomas in vivo and upregulated following
malignant transformation in certain cell types.

El Nemer et al. (1997) showed that CHO cells expressing recombinant
short-tail or long-tail Lu glycoproteins reacted as well with anti-Lu as
with anti-BCAM antibodies, providing definitive proof that the Lu blood
group and BCAM antigens are carried by the same molecules.

Lutheran blood group glycoproteins are receptors for the extracellular
matrix protein laminin. Studies suggest that these glycoproteins may
contribute to vasoocclusion in sickle cell disease (603903), and sickle
cells can be shown to adhere to laminin isoforms containing the alpha-5
chain (laminin-10/11). Laminin alpha-5 (LAMA5; 601033) is present in the
subendothelium and is also a constituent of bone marrow sinusoids,
suggesting a role for the Lu/laminin interaction in erythropoiesis
(Parsons et al., 2001).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by
Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

- Lutheran System

El Nemer et al. (1997) found that BCAM coding sequences amplified from
the genomic DNA of Lu (a+b-) or Lu (a-b+) blood donors showed a single
G-to-A transition in the gene (H77R; 612773.0001). When expressed in
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, Lu cDNAs carrying 229A or 229G
produced cell surface proteins that reacted with anti-Lu(a) or
anti-Lu(b) antibodies, respectively, showing that these nucleotides
specified the 2 major alleles of the Lutheran blood group locus.

Parsons et al. (1997) also demonstrated that the Lu(a)/Lu(b) variant is
determined by an H77R variant in the BCAM1 gene, resulting in a
substitution in immunoglobulin domain 1.

- Auberger System

Parsons et al. (1997) demonstrated that the Au(a)/Au(b) polymorphism
resulted from a variation in the G strand of domain 5 of the BCAM gene
(T539A; 612773.0002)

- Autosomal Recessive Lutheran Null Blood Group Phenotype

In 3 unrelated patients with the autosomal recessive Lutheran null blood
group phenotype (247420), Karamatic Crew et al. (2007) identified
compound heterozygous or homozygous mutations in the BCAM gene
(612773.0003-612773.0006). None of the patients had obvious clinical
manifestations and were identified through routine serology as having
serum anti-LU3 antibodies. All mutations were truncating and affected
the extracellular domain of the Lu glycoprotein, suggesting that none of
the mutant proteins would be integrated into the cell membrane.

NOMENCLATURE

Lutheran is a complex blood group system consisting of 19 antigens
numbered from LU1 to LU21, with 2 numbers (LU10 and LU15) declared
obsolete. Four pairs of these antigens have allelic relationships:
LU1/LU2, also known as Lu(a)/(b); LU6 and LU9; LU8 and LU14; and
LU18/LU19, also known as Au(a)/(b) (Karamatic Crew et al., 2007).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
LUTHERAN BLOOD GROUP POLYMORPHISM Lu(a)/Lu(b)
BCAM, HIS77ARG

Parsons et al. (1997) demonstrated that the Lu(a)/(b) polymorphism
(111200) results from a 252G-A transition in exon 3 of the BCAM gene,
resulting in a his77-to-arg (H77R) substitution in immunoglobulin
domain-1. The Lutheran glycoprotein of Lu(b) immunospecificity has
arginine at position 77.

El Nemer et al. (1997) reported the Lu(a)/Lu(b) polymorphism as a 229A-G
nucleotide change, resulting in a H77R substitution for the Lu(b)
allele. When expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, Lu cDNAs
carrying 229A or 229G produced cell surface proteins that reacted with
anti-Lu(a) or anti-Lu(b) antibodies, respectively, showing that these
nucleotides specified the 2 major alleles of the Lutheran blood group
locus.

Karamatic Crew et al. (2007) noted that Lu(a)/(b) is also referred to as
Lu(1)/(2).

.0002
AUBERGER BLOOD GROUP POLYMORPHISM Au(a)/Au(b)
BCAM, THR539ALA

Parsons et al. (1997) demonstrated that the Au(a)/(b) polymorphism (see
111200) of the Lutheran glycoprotein results from a 1637A-G transition
in the BCAM gene, resulting in a thr539-to-ala (T539A) substitution on
the G strand of domain 5.

Karamatic Crew et al. (2007) noted that Au(a)/(b) is also referred to as
Lu(18)/(19).

.0003
BLOOD GROUP--LUTHERAN NULL
BCAM, ARG231TER

In an English woman with the Lutheran null blood group phenotype
(247420), Karamatic Crew et al. (2007) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the BCAM gene: a 691C-T transition in
exon 6 resulting in an arg231-to-ter (R231X) substitution in the
extracellular second immunoglobulin domain, and a deletion of exons 3
and 4 (612773.0004). The woman had previously been reported by
Darnborough et al. (1963). There were no clinical manifestations; she
was identified through routine serology in preparation for surgery.

.0004
BLOOD GROUP--LUTHERAN NULL
BCAM, DEL EX3-4

See 612773.0003 and Karamatic Crew et al. (2007).

.0005
BLOOD GROUP--LUTHERAN NULL
BCAM, CYS237TER

In a healthy Japanese man with the Lutheran null blood group phenotype
(247420), Mallinson et al. (1997) identified a homozygous 733C-A
transversion in exon 6 of the BCAM gene, resulting in a cys237-to-ter
(C237X) substitution in the extracellular domain. He was identified
through blood donation and had no phenotypic manifestations. His parents
and brother were heterozygous for the mutation. Karamatic Crew et al.
(2007) stated that the C237X substitution resulted from a 711C-A
transversion based on numbering from the translation initiation ATG
codon.

.0006
BLOOD GROUP--LUTHERAN NULL
BCAM, ARG121TER

In a German Caucasian woman with the Lutheran null blood group phenotype
(247420), Karamatic Crew et al. (2004) identified a homozygous 361C-T
transition in exon 3 of the BCAM gene, resulting in an arg121-to-ter
(R121X) substitution in the extracellular first immunoglobulin domain.
She was identified in a surgical work-up.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Shankar et al. (1998) cloned SPAG9 from a human testis cDNA library
using antibodies against sperm proteins showing surface localization as
probe. The deduced 766-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of 84 kD and contains a large N-terminal extracellular domain, a
short transmembrane helical domain, and a cytoplasmic domain. There are
6 putative N-glycosylation sites, several putative phosphorylation sites
for cAMP/cGMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C, and casein
kinase II, and 10 putative myristoylation sites. There is also a leucine
zipper motif, with 6 leucine repeats, that may aid in dimerization since
there is no upstream basic domain characteristic of DNA binding
proteins. Northern blot analysis detected testis-restricted expression
of a 3-kb SPAG9 transcript. In situ hybridization of human testis
sections revealed SPAG9 on round spermatids of stages I, II, and III of
the human seminiferous cycle. Immunohistochemical staining showed that
SPAG9 is exclusively associated with elongated spermatids and not with
round spermatids, indicating posttranscriptional delay in expression.
Analysis of the cDNA revealed 3 putative hairpin loop structures at key
positions within the open reading frame that could stabilize the mRNA in
vivo.

Bowman et al. (2000) identified a broadly conserved membrane-associated
protein, which they termed 'sunday driver' (syd), required for the
functional interaction of kinesin I (see 148760) with axonal cargo in
Drosophila. Mutations in syd and the axonal transport motor kinesin I
were found to cause similar phenotypes in Drosophila, including aberrant
accumulations of axonal cargoes. By searching genomic and EST sequence
databases for proteins similar to syd, Bowman et al. (2000) obtained
full-length cDNAs encoding human SYD1 and mouse Syd2, as well as partial
cDNAs encoding human SYD2 (605431) and mouse Syd1. Human SYD1 is 69%
similar to mouse Syd2 and 55% similar to Drosophila syd. The predicted
SYD proteins have a transmembrane region flanked by an N-terminal domain
containing 2 coiled-coil regions and a C-terminal domain containing a
conserved hydrophobic core. GFP-tagged mouse Syd2 localized to
tubulovesicular structures that costained for kinesin I and a marker of
the secretory pathway.

By immunoscreening a liver cell line cDNA library with systemic
sclerosis (see 181750) serum, Yasuoka et al. (2003) identified a partial
cDNA encoding PHET. RT-PCR detected PHET expression in testis only.
Serum autoantibodies to a recombinant PHET fragment were detected in 8%
of systemic sclerosis patients, but were not present in systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE; 152700) patients or healthy controls. In systemic
sclerosis patients, anti-PHET autoantibodies were associated with
diffuse cutaneous or lung disease. RT-PCR analysis detected increased
PHET expression in systemic sclerosis patient fibroblasts compared with
controls. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated more intense
cytoplasmic staining for PHET in patient fibroblasts. Yasuoka et al.
(2003) concluded that PHET is a testicular antigenic variant of SPAG9
that is overexpressed in systemic sclerosis patient dermal fibroblasts.

GENE FUNCTION

By coimmunoprecipitation analysis, Bowman et al. (2000) found that Syd2
forms a complex with kinesin I in vivo. Yeast 2-hybrid analysis and in
vitro interaction studies revealed that Syd2 directly binds kinesin I
via the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain of kinesin light chain
(KLC; 600025). The authors proposed that the SYD proteins mediate the
axonal transport of at least 1 class of vesicles by interacting directly
with KLC.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SPAG9
gene to chromosome 17 (TMAP WI-9550). Scott (2002) refined the
localization to 17q21.33 based on sequence similarity between the SPAG9
sequence (GenBank GENBANK NM003971) and a chromosome 17 clone (GenBank
GENBANK AC005920).
