600702	TITLE *600702 SODIUM CHANNEL, VOLTAGE-GATED, TYPE VIII, ALPHA SUBUNIT; SCN8A
;;NAV1.6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Voltage-dependent sodium channels, such as SCN8A, are responsible for
the initial membrane depolarization that occurs during generation of
action potentials in most electrically excitable cells (Plummer et al.,
1998).

CLONING

Plummer et al. (1998) isolated and sequenced genomic fragments
containing the exons of a novel human voltage-gated sodium channel
designated SCN8A. SCN8A encodes a 1,980-amino acid protein that shares
close to 99% sequence identity with the mouse protein. It contains
several consensus sites for phosphorylation of serine and threonine
residues that are also conserved in other sodium channel family members.

Plummer et al. (1997) identified 2 alternatively spliced exons of SCN8A,
18N and 18A, that encode transmembrane segments S3 and S4 in domain III.
Exon 18N is expressed in fetal brain and nonneuronal tissues.
Transcripts with exon 18N have a conserved in-frame stop codon that
predicts the synthesis of a truncated, 2-domain protein. The proportion
of transcripts containing exon 18N is highest in mouse fetal brain
between embryonic day (E) 12.5 and E14.5; at E18.5 and later, the 18A
transcript predominates.

GENE STRUCTURE

Plummer et al. (1998) determined that the SCN8A gene contains 28 exons
and identified an additional pair of alternatively spliced exons, 5N and
5A, that encode transmembrane segments of domain I. Exons 5N and 5A
differ by a single amino acid difference at position 7. Plummer et al.
(1998) also found that major and minor protein transcripts are generated
by 2 alternative splice donor sites for exon 10B; the minor transcript
contains 11 extra amino acids.

Drews et al. (2007) identified 4 untranslated 5-prime exons, which they
designated 1a through 1d, in the mouse and human SCN8A genes. These
exons are mutually exclusive, and each is alternatively spliced to the
first coding exon. Exon 1a overlaps with an inserted LINE element, and
the 70-kb interval between the 5-prime noncoding exons and the first
coding exon contains 58% repetitive elements and simple repeats. The
Scn8a genes of lower vertebrates contain only a single 5-prime
untranslated exon that corresponds to mouse and human exon 1c. Exon 1c
contains conserved functional YY1 (600013) and REST (600571) sites.

GENE FUNCTION

Active invasion of the dendritic tree by action potentials generated in
the axon is essential for associative synaptic plasticity and neuronal
ensemble formation. In cortical pyramidal cells, this action potential
back-propagation is supported by dendritic voltage-gated sodium
channels. Using a highly sensitive electron microscopic immunogold
technique, Lorincz and Nusser (2010) revealed the presence of the Nav1.6
subunit in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell proximal and distal dendrites.
Here, the subunit density is lower by a factor of 35 to 80 than that
found in axon initial segments. A gradual decrease in Nav1.6 density
along the proximodistal axis of the dendritic tree was also detected
without any labeling in dendritic spines. Lorincz and Nusser (2010)
concluded that their results revealed the characteristic subcellular
distribution of the Nav1.6 subunit, identifying this molecule as a key
substrate enabling dendritic excitability.

MAPPING

Kohrman et al. (1995) assigned the mouse Scn8a gene to chromosome 15 by
interspecific backcross analysis and the human SCN8A gene to chromosome
12 by hybridization to a somatic cell hybrid mapping panel. Burgess et
al. (1995) mapped the human homolog to 12q13 by fluorescence in situ
hybridization. By physical mapping on a YAC contig, Plummer et al.
(1998) localized the SCN8A gene to 12q13.1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Because SCN8A is widely expressed in neurons of the central and
peripheral nervous systems, and because mutations in the mouse ortholog
result in ataxia and other movement disorders, Trudeau et al. (2006)
screened the 26 coding exons of SCN8A in 151 patients with inherited or
sporadic ataxia. They found a 2-bp deletion in exon 24 (600702.0001) in
a 9-year-old boy with mental retardation, pancerebellar atrophy, and
ataxia (CIAT; 614306). Three additional family members who were
heterozygous for this mutation exhibited milder cognitive behavioral
deficits including attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD;
143465). No additional occurrence of this mutation was observed in 625
unrelated DNA samples (1,250 chromosomes).

In a girl with infantile epileptic encephalopathy-13 (EIEE13; 614558),
Veeramah et al. (2012) identified a de novo heterozygous mutation in the
SCN8A gene (N1768D; 600702.0002). In vitro functional expression studies
showed that the mutation caused a dominant gain-of-function effect, with
neuronal hyperexcitability, persistent sodium currents, incomplete
channel inactivation, increased spontaneous firing,
paroxysmal-depolarizing-shift-like complexes, and an increased firing
frequency.

Carvill et al. (2013) identified a heterozygous mutation in the SCN8A
gene (L12890V; 600702.0003) in a boy with EIEE13. The mutation was
inherited from his father, who was found to be somatic mosaic for the
mutation. No further clinical information was provided. The patient was
part of a cohort of 500 cases of epileptic encephalopathy who underwent
sequencing of candidate genes; he was the only patient found to carry an
SCN8A mutation.

ANIMAL MODEL

The mouse neurologic mutant 'motor endplate disease' (med) is
characterized by early-onset progressive paralysis of the hindlimbs,
severe muscle atrophy, degeneration of Purkinje cells, and juvenile
lethality. Burgess et al. (1995) isolated a voltage-gated sodium channel
gene, Scn8a, from the flanking region of a transgene-induced allele of
med. Scn8a is expressed in brain and spinal cord but not in skeletal
muscle or heart, and encodes a predicted protein of 1,732 amino acids.
An intragenic deletion at the site of transgene insertion resulted in
loss of expression. The gene is closely related to other sodium channel
alpha subunits: SCN1A (182389), SCN2A (182390), SCN3A (182391), SCN4A
(603967), SCN5A (600163), and SCN6A (182392). Kohrman et al. (1996)
identified a missense mutation in Scn8a that is associated with
cerebellar ataxia in the 'jolting' mutant, a mild allele of the med
locus. Kohrman et al. (1996) described the molecular changes in Scn8a
underlying 2 other spontaneous mutants, med and med(J). The med mutation
was caused by insertion of a truncated LINE element into exon 2 of
Scn8a. The med transcript was spliced from exon 1 to a cryptic acceptor
site in intron 2. In the med(J) allele, a 4-bp deletion within 5-prime
donor site of exon 3 resulted in splicing from exon 1 to exon 4. Both
mutant transcripts altered the reading frame with premature stop codons
close to the N terminus of the protein. Loss of Scn8a expression
resulted in progressive paralysis and early death. Intron 2 of Scn8a is
flanked by minor class AT-AC splice sites. The observed splicing
patterns of the med and med(J) mutant transcripts provided evidence for
preferential in vivo splicing between donor and acceptor sites of the
same class. The apparent functional incompatibility may be a consequence
of the different composition of spliceosomes bound to major and minor
splice sites. The unusual pattern of exon skipping in these mutant
identified Scn8a as a member of a small group of genes containing
introns with nonstandard AT-AC splice sites. AT-AC introns are processed
by alternative splicing machinery that includes U11 and U12 snRNPs.
Meisler et al. (1997) reviewed how the analysis of molecular defects in
mouse mutants can identify candidate genes for human neurologic
disorders, as illustrated by Scn8a among other genes.

Sprunger et al. (1999) studied the mouse mutant med(J), which contains a
splice site mutation in the neuronal sodium channel Scn8a that results
in a very low level of expression. On the C57BL/6J genetic background,
med(J) homozygotes exhibited progressive paralysis and juvenile
lethality. The C3H genetic background had an ameliorating effect,
producing viable adults with a novel dystonic phenotype. The dystonic
mice exhibited movement-induced, sustained abnormal postures of the
trunk and limbs. Sprunger et al. (1999) mapped a dominant modifier locus
responsible for the difference between strains to a 4.5 +/- 1.3-cM
interval on mouse chromosome 3. These findings established a role for
ion channels in dystonia and demonstrated the impact of genetic
background on its severity and progression. This new model suggested to
Sprunger et al. (1999) that SCN8A on 12q13 and SCNM1 (which by
comparative mapping is presumably located on 1p21-q21) may contribute to
human inherited dystonia.

The dystonia demonstrated by Sprunger et al. (1999) in association with
the Scn8a mutation was the first to be related to mutation in an ion
channel. Furthermore, the med(J) mouse differed from other animal models
with dystonia in that the condition persisted to adulthood and was not
associated with neurodegeneration. Sprunger et al. (1999) suggested that
the med(J) mutation should be classified as a hypomorphic allele because
a low level of full-length Scn8a transcripts was demonstrated in
homozygotes, indicating normal splicing at low efficiency. Homozygotes
for null alleles of Scn8a could not survive even in the presence of 2
copies of the Scnm1(H) modifier allele. Thus, prevention of paralysis
and survival to adulthood required both a low level of wildtype
transcript and at least 1 copy of the dominant allele of Scnm1. C57BL/6J
carries a recessive allele of Scmn1 that, in combination with a
hypomorphic level of Scn8a, resulted in paralysis and lethality.

DeRepentigny et al. (2001) described a spontaneous autosomal recessive
mutation in the mouse, which they termed 'degenerating muscle' (dmu),
that is characterized by skeletal and cardiac muscle degeneration. Dmu
mice are weak and have great difficulty in moving due to muscle atrophy
and wasting in the hindquarters. Histopathologic observations and
ultrastructural analysis revealed muscle degeneration in both skeletal
and cardiac muscle, but no abnormalities in sciatic nerves. Using
linkage analysis, the authors mapped the dmu locus to the distal portion
of mouse chromosome 15 in a region syntenic to human chromosome 12q13.
The human disorder scapuloperoneal myopathy (SPM; 181430) has been
linked to this region, and SPM patients with associated cardiomyopathy
have been described. Intact transcripts for Scn8a were present in dmu
mice, but their levels were dramatically reduced. Furthermore, genetic
complementation crosses between dmu and med mice revealed that they are
allelic. The authors concluded that at least a portion of the dmu
phenotype may be caused by a downregulation of Scn8a, and that SCN8A is
a candidate gene for human SPM.

Kearney et al. (2002) described a sensitive allele of the unlinked
modifier locus, Scnm1, which results in juvenile lethality in C57BL/6J
mice carrying the med(J) mutation. The modifier acts on the splicing
efficiency of the mutant splice donor site in Scn8a, and mutant mice
display either 90% or 95% reduction in the proportion of correctly
spliced mRNA, depending on modifier genotype. The abundance of the
channel protein, NaV1.6, is also reduced by an order of magnitude in
med(J) mice, resulting in delayed maturation of nodes of Ranvier, slowed
nerve conduction velocity, reduced muscle mass, and reduction of brain
metabolic activity.

Martin et al. (2007) showed that Scn8a(med) and Scn8a(med-jo) mice,
which carry the heterozygous 'jolting' point mutation, were more
resistant to pharmacologically induced seizures than wildtype
littermates, suggesting that altered Scn8a function reduces neuronal
excitability. They also showed that the seizure severity of heterozygous
Scn1a +/- mice (see Yu et al., 2006), which is a mouse model for severe
myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (SMEI; 607208), was ameliorated by the
Scn8a(med-jo) allele. Double-heterozygous Scn1a +/- and Scn8a +/(med-jo)
mice had seizure thresholds that were comparable to wildtype
littermates, and the Scn8a(med-jo) allele was also able to rescue the
premature lethality of Scn1a +/- mice and extended the life span of
Scn1a -/- mice. The authors hypothesized that the opposing effects of
Scn1a and Scn8a dysfunction on seizure thresholds result from
differences in the cell types that are influenced by the respective
sodium channel subtypes. Scn1a mutants result in reduced sodium currents
in inhibitory GABAergic interneurons of the hippocampus and cortex,
whereas Scn8a mutants affect excitatory pyramidal cells of the
hippocampus and cortex, suggesting that reduced excitability of these
cells may underlie the elevated seizure resistance of Scn8a-mutant mice.
Martin et al. (2007) suggested that their results demonstrated that
genetic interactions can alter seizure severity, and supported the
hypothesis that genetic modifiers, including the SCN8A gene, contribute
to the clinical variability observed in SMEI and GEFS+.

By ENU-induced mutagenesis screen in mice, Papale et al. (2009)
generated a val929-to-phe (V929F) mutation in the Scn8a gene. This
residue in the pore loop of domain 2 is evolutionarily conserved.
Electroencephalography (EEG) revealed well-defined spike-wave discharges
(SWD), the hallmark of absence epilepsy (see 600131), in
V929F-heterozygous mice and in mice heterozygous for either the
Scn8a(med) or Scn8a(med-jo) mutations. Genetic background had a
significant effect on SWD, with mutants on the C3HeB/FeJ strain showing
a higher incidence than on C57BL/6J. Papale et al. (2009) suggested that
the SCN8A gene may be a candidate gene for absence epilepsy in humans.

COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT WITH OR WITHOUT CEREBELLAR ATAXIA
SCN8A, 2-BP DEL, 5157CT

In a 9-year-old boy with mental retardation, pancerebellar atrophy, and
ataxia (614306), Trudeau et al. (2006) identified heterozygosity for a
2-bp deletion in exon 4 of the SCN8A gene, which introduced a
translation termination codon into the pore loop of domain 4, resulting
in removal of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain and predicting loss of
channel function (pro1719argfsX6). Three additional heterozygous family
members exhibited milder cognitive and behavioral deficits including
attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; 143465). Trudeau et al.
(2006) noted that it was unclear whether the relatives of the proband
had a milder version of the neurologic abnormalities seen in the proband
due to haploinsufficiency for SCN8A, or if the proband's symptoms were
caused by an unrelated developmental disorder.

EPILEPTIC ENCEPHALOPATHY, EARLY INFANTILE, 13
SCN8A, ASN1768ASP

In a girl with infantile epileptic encephalopathy-13 (EIEE13; 614558),
Veeramah et al. (2012) identified a de novo heterozygous 5302A-G
transition in the SCN8A gene, resulting in an asn1768-to-asp (N1768D)
substitution in a highly conserved residue in the final transmembrane
segment adjacent to the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. The mutation was
identified by whole-genome sequencing. Expression of the mutant protein
in a neuronal cell line showed that it caused persistent sodium
currents, incomplete channel inactivation, and a depolarizing shift in
the voltage dependence of steady-state fast inactivation. Current-clamp
analysis in rat hippocampal neurons transfected with the mutant protein
showed increased spontaneous firing, paroxysmal-depolarizing-shift-like
complexes, and an increased firing frequency, consistent with a dominant
gain-of-function phenotype. All of these studies were consistent with
neuronal hyperexcitability. Whole-genome sequencing also identified
putative recessive variants in the NRP2 (602070) and UNC13C (614568)
genes in the proband, which may have contributed to the phenotype. The
patient developed refractory generalized seizures at age 6 months. At
age 4 years, the seizure phenotype changed to epileptic spasms, followed
by regression of speech and language skills. She also had developmental
delay, intellectual disability, autism, hypotonia, and difficulties with
coordination and balance. Initial electroencephalogram (EEG) showed
bifrontal spikes and brief bursts of generalized spike-wave activity.
Later EEG showed diffuse slowing, multifocal spikes, and frontally
predominant generalized spikes. Brain MRI was normal. The patient died
suddenly at age 15 years. There was no family history of a similar
disorder.

SCN8A, LEU1290VAL

In a boy with EIEE13 (614558), Carvill et al. (2013) identified a
heterozygous c.3868C-G transversion in the SCN8A gene, resulting in a
leu1290-to-val (L1290V) substitution. The patient had onset of seizures
at age 18 months. The mutation was inherited from the father, who was
found to be somatic mosaic for the mutation.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Kinesins are microtubule-based motor proteins involved in the transport
of organelles in eukaryotic cells. They typically consist of 2
identical, approximately 110- to 120-kD heavy chains, such as KIF5B, and
2 identical, approximately 60- to 70-kD light chains. The heavy chain
contains 3 domains: a globular N-terminal motor domain, which converts
the chemical energy of ATP into a motile force along microtubules in 1
fixed direction; a central alpha-helical rod domain, which enables the 2
heavy chains to dimerize; and a globular C-terminal domain, which
interacts with light chains and possibly an organelle receptor (summary
by Navone et al. (1992) and Niclas et al. (1994)).

CLONING

By screening a human placenta cDNA library with a probe based on a
conserved region of the Drosophila and squid kinesin heavy chains
(KHCs), Navone et al. (1992) isolated cDNAs encoding KNS1. The predicted
963-amino acid protein has 63% sequence identity to the Drosophila KHC.
Immunoblot analysis using antibodies against squid KHC detected a 120-kD
protein in CV-1 monkey kidney epithelial cells. Immunofluorescence
studies showed that KNS1 expressed in CV-1 cells had both a diffuse
distribution and a filamentous staining pattern that coaligned with
microtubules but not vimentin (VIM; 193060) intermediate filaments; the
KNS1 N- and C-terminal domains, but not the alpha-helical rod domain,
also colocalized with microtubules.

By Northern blot analysis, Niclas et al. (1994) demonstrated that Ukhc
was expressed as multiple transcripts in all rat tissues examined.
Immunoblot analysis of rat tissue extracts using antibodies specific for
UKHC detected a 120-kD protein in all examined tissues. Niclas et al.
(1994) found that UKHC is distributed uniformly between the cell body
and processes of cultured hippocampal neurons.

MAPPING

Niclas et al. (1994) stated that the placenta UKHC cDNA isolated by
Navone et al. (1992) hybridizes to a region on mouse chromosome 18 that
shows homology of synteny with human 18q. However, Gross (2013) mapped
the human KIF5B gene to chromosome 10p11.22 based on an alignment of the
KIF5B sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC126279) with the genomic sequence

Lawrence et al. (2004) presented a standardized kinesin nomenclature
based on 14 family designations. Under this system, KIF5B belongs to the
kinesin-1 family.

GENE FUNCTION

Kamal et al. (2000) demonstrated that the axonal transport of APP in
neurons is mediated by the direct binding of APP to the kinesin light
chain (600025) subunit of kinesin-I. Kamal et al. (2001) identified an
axonal membrane compartment that contains APP, beta-secretase (604252),
and presenilin-1 (104311). The fast anterograde axonal transport of this
compartment is mediated by APP and kinesin-I. Proteolytic processing of
APP can occur in the compartment in vitro and in vivo in axons. This
proteolysis generates amyloid-beta and a carboxy-terminal fragment of
APP, and liberates kinesin-I from the membrane. Kamal et al. (2001)
concluded that APP functions as a kinesin-I membrane receptor, mediating
the axonal transport of beta-secretase and presenilin-1, and that
processing of APP to amyloid-beta by secretases can occur in an axonal
membrane compartment transported by kinesin-I.

Kanai et al. (2004) found that the hinge and C-terminal tail regions of
Kif5a (602821), Kif5b, and Kif5c (604593) bound a large
detergent-resistant RNase-sensitive granule from mouse brain. Mass
spectrometric analysis showed that the granule contained mRNAs for
Camk2-alpha (CAMK2A; 114078) and Arc (NOL3; 605235) and 42 proteins,
including those for RNA transport, protein synthesis, and translational
silencing. The granule localized to dendrites and underwent
bidirectional movement. Distally directed movement of the granule was
enhanced by Kif5 overexpression and reduced by Kif5 functional blockage.
Kanai et al. (2004) concluded that kinesins transport RNA in dendrites
via this large granule.

Kural et al. (2005) used fluorescence imaging with 1-nanometer accuracy
(FIONA) to analyze organelle movement by conventional kinesin and
cytoplasmic dynein (see 600112) in a cell. They located a green
fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged peroxisome in cultured Drosophila S2
cells to within 1.5 nanometers in 1.1 milliseconds, a 400-fold
improvement in temporal resolution, sufficient to determine the average
step size to be approximately 8 nanometers for both dynein and kinesin.
Furthermore, Kural et al. (2005) found that dynein and kinesin do not
work against each other in vivo during peroxisome transport. Rather,
multiple kinesins or multiple dyneins work together, producing up to 10
times the in vitro speed.

To determine the effects of tau (157140) on dynein and kinesin motility,
Dixit et al. (2008) conducted single-molecule studies of motor proteins
moving along tau-decorated microtubules. Dynein tended to reverse
direction, whereas kinesin tended to detach at patches of bound tau.
Kinesin was inhibited at about a tenth of the tau concentration that
inhibited dynein, and the microtubule-binding domain of tau was
sufficient to inhibit motor activity. The differential modulation of
dynein and kinesin motility suggests that microtubule-associated
proteins (MAPs) can spatially regulate the balance of
microtubule-dependent axonal transport.

Metzger et al. (2012) identified the microtubule-associated protein MAP7
(604108) and KIF5B as essential, evolutionarily conserved regulators of
myonuclear positioning in Drosophila and cultured mammalian myotubes.
Metzger et al. (2012) found that these proteins interact physically and
that expression of the KIF5B motor domain fused to the MAP7
microtubule-binding domain rescues nuclear positioning defects in
MAP7-depleted cells. This suggested that MAP7 links KIF5B to the
microtubule cytoskeleton to promote nuclear positioning. Finally,
Metzger et al. (2012) showed that myonuclear positioning is
physiologically important. Drosophila ensconsin (ens; homolog of MAP7)
mutant larvae have decreased locomotion and incorrect myonuclear
positioning, and these phenotypes are rescued by muscle-specific
expression of ens. Metzger et al. (2012) concluded that improper nuclear
positioning contributes to muscle dysfunction in a cell-autonomous
fashion.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Kull et al. (1996) reported the crystal structure of the human kinesin
motor domain with bound ADP. The motor consists primarily of a single
alpha/beta arrowhead-shaped domain. It has striking structural
similarity to the core of the catalytic domain of the actin-based motor
myosin, although kinesin and myosin have virtually no amino acid
sequence identity and exhibit distinct enzymatic and motile properties.

Mori et al. (2007) developed 2 different single-molecule fluorescence
resonance energy transfer sensors to detect whether kinesin is bound to
its microtubule track by 1 or 2 heads. Their FRET results indicated
that, while moving in the presence of saturating ATP, kinesin spends
most of its time bound to the microtubule with both heads. However, when
nucleotide binding becomes rate-limiting at low ATP concentrations,
kinesin waits for ATP in a one-head-bound state and makes brief
transitions to a 2-head-bound intermediate as it walks along the
microtubule. On the basis of these results, Mori et al. (2007) suggested
a model for how transitions in the ATPase cycle position the 2 kinesin
heads and drive their hand-over-hand motion.

Pernigo et al. (2013) presented the crystal structure of the
tetratricopeptide repeat domain of kinesin light chain-2 (611729) in
complex with a cargo peptide harboring a tryptophan-acidic motif derived
from SKIP (609613), a critical host determinant in Salmonella
pathogenesis and a regulator of lysosomal positioning. Structural data
together with biophysical, biochemical, and cellular assays allowed
Pernigo et al. (2013) to propose a framework for intracellular transport
based on the binding by kinesin-1 of W-acidic cargo motifs through a
combination of electrostatic interactions and sequence-specific
elements, providing direct molecular evidence of the mechanisms for
kinesin-1:cargo recognition.

ANIMAL MODEL

Tanaka et al. (1998) disrupted the mouse kif5B gene by homologous
recombination. The kif5B -/- mice were embryonic lethal with a severe
growth retardation at 9.5 to 11.5 days postcoitum. To analyze the
significance of this conventional kinesin heavy chain in organelle
transport, the authors studied the distribution of major organelles in
the extraembryonic cells. The null mutant cells impaired lysosomal
dispersion, while brefeldin A could normally induce the breakdown of
their Golgi apparatus. More prominently, their mitochondria abnormally
clustered in the perinuclear region. This mitochondrial phenotype was
reversed by an exogenous expression of KIF5B, and a subcellular
fractionation revealed that KIF5B was associated with mitochondria.
These data indicated that kinesin is essential for mitochondrial and
lysosomal dispersion rather than for the Golgi-to-endoplasmic reticulum
traffic in these cells.
