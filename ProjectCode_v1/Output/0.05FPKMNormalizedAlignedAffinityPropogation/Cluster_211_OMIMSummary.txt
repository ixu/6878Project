DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In the choreoacanthocytosis (200150) critical region on chromosome 9q,
Rampoldi et al. (2001) identified the VPS13A gene, which they called
CHAC. They identified 2 splice variants: transcript A, which contains
exons 1 to 68 and 70 to 73 and encodes a 3,174-amino acid protein, and
transcript B, which contains exons 1 to 69 and encodes a 3,095-amino
acid protein. Northern blot analysis detected 2 bands of high molecular
mass corresponding to the 2 splice variants in all tissues analyzed.
Additionally, RT-PCR detected expression in the erythrocyte precursor
cell line K562. Rampoldi et al. (2001) showed that the CHAC gene encodes
an evolutionarily conserved protein, which may be involved in protein
sorting.

Independently, Ueno et al. (2001) identified the VPS13A gene and found
that it encodes a 3,096-amino acid protein, which they termed chorein.
Northern blot analysis detected a 10-kb transcript in brain, heart,
skeletal muscle, and kidney.

By EST database analysis and RT-PCR of lymphoid cell line and brain RNA,
Velayos-Baeza et al. (2004) identified several additional splice
variants of VPS13A generated by exon skipping or utilization of
alternative internal exons. Northern blot analysis and RT-PCR detected
VPS13A expression at variable levels in all tissues examined, and
transcript encoding the 3,174-amino acid protein was the major variant.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rampoldi et al. (2001) determined that the VPS13A gene contains 73 exons
and spans 250 kb. Velayos-Baeza et al. (2004) identified 5 additional
alternative exons in the VPS13A gene, exons 7b, 31b, 34b, 68b, and 69b,
but 3 of these, exons 31b, 34b, and 69b, have stop codons in all 3
reading frames.

MAPPING

Rampoldi et al. (2001) mapped the VPS13A gene to chromosome 9q21-q22.
Velayos-Baeza et al. (2004) mapped the mouse Vps13a gene to chromosome
19A.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 11 families with choreoacanthocytosis, Rampoldi
et al. (2001) identified 16 different mutations in the VPS13A gene (see,
e.g., 605978.0001).

In 4 affected patients from 3 Japanese pedigrees with
choreoacanthocytosis, Ueno et al. (2001) identified a homozygous
deletion in the coding region of the VPS13A gene (605978.0003).

Among 43 patients with choreoacanthocytosis, Dobson-Stone et al. (2002)
identified 57 different mutations distributed throughout the CHAC gene
(see, e.g., 605978.0004). In 7 patients, only 1 heterozygous mutation
was found; in 4 patients, no disease mutations were found. The authors
noted that small gene deletions or rearrangements may not have been
detected in these patients.

Dobson-Stone et al. (2005) stated that 75 different mutations in the
VPS13A gene had been identified in 58 probands with
choreoacanthocytosis.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CHOREOACANTHOCYTOSIS
VPS13A, ILE90LYS

In a patient with choreoacanthocytosis (200150), Rampoldi et al. (2001)
found compound heterozygosity for a 269T-A transversion in exon 4 of the
VPS13A gene and an insertion of a T between nucleotides 6404 and 6405 in
exon 48. The mutations resulted in an ile90-to-lys (I90K) amino acid
change and a frameshift, respectively.

.0003
CHOREOACANTHOCYTOSIS
VPS13A, 260-BP DEL

In affected members of 3 Japanese families with choreoacanthocytosis
(200150), Ueno et al. (2001) identified a homozygous 260-bp deletion in
the VPS13A gene, leading to a truncated protein. The families originated
from a small area in Japan, and haplotype analysis indicated a founder
effect. Some of the patients' parents, who were heterozygous for the
mutation, showed a slight degree of acanthocytosis in peripheral blood
but no distinct neurologic abnormalities except for cryptogenic abducens
palsy in 1 parent.

.0004
CHOREOACANTHOCYTOSIS
VPS13A, ARG208TER

In 3 patients with choreoacanthocytosis, Dobson-Stone et al. (2002)
identified a 622C-T change in exon 9 of the CHAC gene, resulting in an
arg208-to-ter nonsense substitution (R208X). One patient was homozygous
for the mutation and 2 others were compound heterozygous for R208X and
another CHAC mutation. The R208X mutation had previously been reported
by Rampoldi et al. (2001) in a family with choreoacanthocytosis.

.0005
CHOREOACANTHOCYTOSIS
VPS13A, 8035G-A

In 2 affected sibs from a Japanese family with choreoacanthocytosis
(200150) with apparent autosomal dominant inheritance, Saiki et al.
(2003) identified a heterozygous G-to-A transversion at the last
nucleotide of exon 57 of the CHAC gene, predicted to induce skipping of
exon 57 and premature termination of the protein. The mutation was not
detected in their unaffected mother. Family history revealed that 3
other living family members were affected and 2 deceased members were
believed to be affected. All 5 living affected members showed
acanthocytosis (approximately 15-20%) and involuntary movements. In an
erratum, the authors stated that an error in sequencing had occurred and
the inheritance pattern should have been reported as autosomal recessive
(pseudodominant). Tomiyasu et al. (2011) identified the 2 mutations in
the VPS13A gene in this family: an 8035G-A transition in exon 57,
causing a frameshift and premature termination (Ile2652HisfsTer12), and
a 1305G-A transition in exon 15, resulting in a trp435-to-ter (W435X;
605978.0010) substitution; the latter mutation was also identified in
the unaffected mother.

.0006
CHOREOACANTHOCYTOSIS
VPS13A, 1-BP DEL, 6059C

In 2 unrelated males of Ashkenazi Jewish descent with
choreoacanthocytosis (200150), Lossos et al. (2005) identified a
homozygous 1-bp deletion (6059delC) in exon 46 of the VPS13A gene,
predicted to result in premature termination of the protein.

.0007
CHOREOACANTHOCYTOSIS
VPS13A, 7-KB DEL

In an Iraqi Jewish woman with choreoacanthocytosis (200150), Lossos et
al. (2005) identified a homozygous 7-kb deletion spanning exon 23 of the
VPS13A gene. She had trichotillomania and anxiety but little
neuromuscular involvement.

.0008
CHOREOACANTHOCYTOSIS
VPS13A, 37-KB DEL

In affected members of 3 French Canadian families with
choreoacanthocytosis (200150), Dobson-Stone et al. (2005) identified a
homozygous 37-kb deletion in the VPS13A gene, resulting in the deletion
of exons 70 through 73. The deletion also encompassed the 2 terminal
exons of the neighboring GNA14 gene (604397). Haplotype analysis
indicated a founder effect.

.0009
CHOREOACANTHOCYTOSIS
VPS13A, 2-BP DUP, 3556AC

In 2 Mexican mestizo sisters, born of consanguineous parents, with
choreoacanthocytosis (200150), Ruiz-Sandoval et al. (2007) identified a
homozygous 2-bp duplication (3556dupAC) in exon 33 of the VPS13A gene,
resulting in a frameshift and premature termination. The proband had
onset at age 32 years and showed severe progression of the disorder; at
age 42, she was emaciated, anarthric, and reactive only to simple
commands. In contrast, her sister had onset at age 45 years and
primarily showed motor and verbal tics, paranoid behavior, and
depression.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs; EC 2.5.1.18) are a family of enzymes
that play an important role in detoxification by catalyzing the
conjugation of many hydrophobic and electrophilic compounds with reduced
glutathione. Based on their biochemical, immunologic, and structural
properties, the mammalian cytosolic GSTs are divided into several
classes, including alpha (e.g., 138359), mu (e.g., 138350), kappa
(602321), theta (e.g., 600436), pi, omega (e.g., 605482), and zeta
(e.g., 603758). In addition, there is a class of microsomal GSTs (e.g.,
138330). Each class is encoded by a single gene or a gene family.

CLONING

By screening a human placenta cDNA library with a rat placenta GST
(GSTP) cDNA, Kano et al. (1987) isolated GST-pi cDNAs. The predicted
209-amino acid protein shares 86% sequence identity with GSTP. However,
GST-pi has a pI of 5.5, while that of GSTP is 6.9. Northern
hybridization revealed that GST-pi is expressed as a 750-nucleotide mRNA
in liver. Moscow et al. (1988) cloned cDNA corresponding to the anionic
isozyme of glutathione S-transferase (GST-pi), one of the
drug-detoxifying enzymes overexpressed in multidrug-resistant cells.
Board et al. (1989) isolated a partial cDNA clone of GST3 from a human
lung cDNA library using antiserum to human lung GST3. The sequence
showed 2 base differences from that of GST3 isolated from a human
placenta cDNA library.

Kingsley et al. (1989) and Seldin et al. (1991) concluded that Gsta of
the mouse is homologous to human GST2 (138360), not GST3.

GENE STRUCTURE

Morrow et al. (1989) reported that the GST-pi gene contains 7 exons and
spans approximately 2.8 kb.

MAPPING

Using an X;11 translocation segregating in hybrids, Silberstein et al.
(1982) and Silberstein and Shows (1982) showed that the GST3 gene, which
they called GST1, is located in the p13-qter region of chromosome 11.
Laisney et al. (1983) concluded that the GST gene localized to
chromosome 11 by Silberstein and Shows (1982) was GST3. They assigned
the gene to 11q13-q22. Suzuki and Board (1984) also stated that the
glutathione S-transferase gene that was mapped to chromosome 11 was
GST3, not GST1.

Moscow et al. (1988) and Board et al. (1989) mapped the GST-pi gene to
11q13 using in situ hybridization. Using a panel of human-rodent somatic
cell hybrids and a DNA probe specific for the class, Islam et al. (1989)
mapped GST3, called by them a class pi gene, to chromosome 11. By study
of somatic cell hybrids, Konohana et al. (1990) confirmed the assignment
of the GST3 gene to 11q. Smith et al. (1995) refined the localization of
the GSTP1 gene by study of radiation-reduced somatic cell hybrids. They
identified a tandem repeat polymorphism in the 5-prime region and used
it for linkage analysis to demonstrate that GSTP1 is 5 cM distal to PYGM
(608455) and 4 cM proximal to FGF3 (164950).

Rochelle et al. (1992) indicated that the mouse Gst3 locus is on
proximal chromosome 19.

- Pseudogenes

In in situ hybridization studies that assigned the GSTP1 gene to 11q13,
Board et al. (1989) found an additional hybridizing locus at 12q13-q14.
Board et al. (1992) demonstrated that this closely related Pi class
glutathione S-transferase gene is, in fact, a partial
reverse-transcribed pseudogene.

GENE FUNCTION

Laisney et al. (1984) stated that GST3 is present in all tissues and
cells, with the exception of red cells, in which only erythrocyte GST
(GSTe) is observed. Furthermore, GSTe, the electrophoretically fastest
and most thermolabile of different GSTs analyzed, is found only in
erythrocytes. In leukocytes, only GST3 is found. Beutler et al. (1988),
quoting Board (1981), stated that the enzyme in red cells is designated
GST3 (or GST-rho) and is different from the major liver enzymes GST1 and
GST2 (GSTA2; 138360). The function of the red cell enzyme is not known,
but the red cell membrane contains transport systems that actively
transport glutathione-xenobiotic conjugates from the red cell. Thus, GST
may serve to rid the red cell, and perhaps to scavenge the bloodstream,
of foreign molecules.

Moscow et al. (1989) compared the expression of GST-pi in several normal
and malignant tissues. They found that GST-pi expression was increased
in many tumors relative to matched normal tissue. Konohana et al. (1990)
demonstrated that GST3 is abundantly expressed in human skin.

Bora et al. (1991) identified GST-pi as fatty acid ethyl ester synthase
III (FAEES3), a heart enzyme that metabolizes ethanol nonoxidatively.
Transfection of FAEES3 cDNA into MCF7 cells resulted in a 14-fold
increase in synthase activity and a 12-fold increase in glutathione
S-transferase activity. Transfection of MCF7 cells with placental GST
cDNA resulted in a 13-fold increase in GST activity but no increase in
synthase activity. Board et al. (1993) found that the protein described
by Bora et al. (1991) had no FAEES or GST activity when expressed in E.
coli and suggested that the cDNA may have resulted from a cloning
artifact.

Overdose of acetaminophen, a widely used analgesic drug, can result in
severe hepatotoxicity and is often fatal. This toxic reaction is
associated with metabolic activation by the P450 system to form a
quinoneimine metabolite, which covalently binds to proteins and other
macromolecules to cause cellular damage. At low doses, this metabolite,
NAPQI, is efficiently detoxified, principally by conjugation with
glutathione, a reaction catalyzed in part by the glutathione
S-transferases, including GSTP1. To assess the role of GST in
acetaminophen hepatotoxicity, Henderson et al. (2000) examined
acetaminophen metabolism and liver damage in mice null for Gstp, i.e.,
Gstp1/p2 -/-. Contrary to their expectations, instead of being more
sensitive, the null mice were highly resistant to the hepatotoxic
effects of this compound. The data demonstrated that GSTP does not
contribute in vivo to the formation of glutathione conjugates of
acetaminophen but plays a novel and unexpected role in the toxicity of
this compound.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Ali-Osman et al. (1997) isolated cDNAs corresponding to 3 polymorphic
GSTP1 alleles, GSTP1*A (134660.0001), GSTP1*B (134660.0002), and GSTP1*C
(134660.0003), expressed in normal cells and malignant gliomas. The
variant cDNAs result from A-to-G and C-to-T transitions at nucleotides
313 and 341, respectively. The transitions changed codon 105 from ATC
(ile) in GSTP1*A to GTC (val) in GSTP1*B and GSTP1*C, and changed codon
114 from GCG (ala) to GTG (val) in GSTP1*C. Both amino acid changes are
in the electrophile-binding active site of the GST-pi peptide. Computer
modeling of the deduced crystal structures of the encoded peptides
showed significant deviations in the interatomic distances of critical
electrophile-binding active site amino acids as a consequence of the
amino acid changes. The encoded proteins expressed in E. coli and
purified by GSH affinity chromatography showed a 3-fold lower K(m) and a
3- to 4-fold higher K(cat)/K(m) for the GSTP1*A-encoded protein than the
proteins encoded by GSTP1*B and GSTP1*C. Analysis of 75 cases showed the
relative frequency of GSTP1*C to be 4-fold higher in malignant gliomas
than in normal tissues. These data provided conclusive molecular
evidence of allelopolymorphism of the human GSTP1 locus, resulting in
active, functionally different GSTP1 proteins, and laid the groundwork
for studies of the role of this gene in xenobiotic metabolism, cancer,
and other human diseases.

Allan et al. (2001) hypothesized that polymorphisms in genes that encode
GSTs alter susceptibility to chemotherapy-induced carcinogenesis,
specifically to therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML), a
devastating complication of long-term cancer survival. Elucidation of
genetic determinants may help identify individuals at increased risk of
developing t-AML. To this end, Allan et al. (2001) examined 89 cases of
t-AML, 420 cases of de novo AML, and 1,022 controls for polymorphisms in
these 3 GSTs. Gene deletion of GSTM1 or GSTT1 was not specifically
associated with susceptibility to t-AML. At least 1 GSTP1 valine-105
allele (see 134660.0002 and 134660.0003) was found more often among
t-AML patients with prior exposure to chemotherapy (OR, 2.66),
particularly among those with prior exposure to known GSTP1 substrates
(OR, 4.34), than in patients with de novo AML, and not among those t-AML
patients with prior exposure to radiotherapy alone (OR, 1.01). These
data suggested that inheritance of at least 1 GSTP1 valine-105 allele
confers a significantly increased risk of developing t-AML after
cytotoxic chemotherapy, but not after radiotherapy.

Beutler et al. (1988) found unexplained red cell GST deficiency in an
otherwise healthy adult male with mild hemolytic anemia accompanied by
splenomegaly, indirect hyperbilirubinemia, and cholelithiasis. Residual
enzyme activity was only about 15% of mean normal. Because he was
adopted and childless, the hereditary nature of the defect could not be
established. Modest decreases in leukocyte and platelet GST activities
were documented.

Menegon et al. (1998) pursued the hypotheses that Parkinson disease
(168600) is secondary to the presence of neurotoxins and that pesticides
are possible causative agents. Because glutathione transferases
metabolize xenobiotics, including pesticides, they investigated the role
of GST polymorphisms in the pathogenesis of idiopathic Parkinson
disease. In 95 Parkinson disease patients and 95 controls, they
genotyped PCR polymorphisms in 4 GST classes: GST1, GSTT1 (600436),
GSTP1, and GSTZ1 (603758). Associations were found only with the GSTP1
polymorphisms. Analyzing the genotypes of those subjects who reported
exposure to pesticides (39 patients and 26 controls), they found that
the distribution of genotypes of the GSTP1 polymorphisms differed
significantly between patients and controls. These differences seemed to
be secondary to an excess of heterozygotes and noncarriers of A alleles
among patients. Menegon et al. (1998) interpreted these results as
suggesting that GSTP1, which is expressed in the blood-brain barrier,
may influence response to neurotoxins and explain the susceptibility of
some people to the parkinsonism-inducing effects of pesticides. In a
commentary entitled 'Parkinson's Disease: Nature Meets Nurture,' Golbe
(1998) pointed out that virtually every case-control study investigating
the risk of Parkinson disease has shown that pesticide or herbicide
exposure, or rural or farm experiences, increases Parkinson disease
risk, typically 3-fold or 4-fold. Furthermore, rotenone, a commonly used
pesticide, shares with the active metabolite of MPTP (a known cause of
parkinsonism in humans and laboratory animals) the same neurotoxic
action, namely inhibition of complex I, part of the mitochondrial
respiratory enzyme chain.

Zusterzeel et al. (1999) found that GSTP1 is the main GST isoform in
normal placental and decidual tissue. In preeclamptic (189800) women,
they found lower median placental and decidual GSTP1 levels compared to
those in controls. Zusterzeel et al. (1999) suggested that reduced
levels of GSTP1 in preeclampsia may indicate a decreased capacity of the
detoxification system, resulting in a higher susceptibility to
preeclampsia. Among 113 preeclampsia trios (mother, father, and baby),
Zusterzeel et al. (2002) found an increased frequency of the GSTP1
val105 polymorphism (see 134660.0002) in mothers, fathers, and offspring
of preeclamptic pregnancies compared to controls. There was no
significant difference in the GSTP1 allele frequencies in preeclamptic
mothers, fathers, and offspring. The authors emphasized the paternal
contribution to the risk for preeclampsia.

Gilliland et al. (2004) found that GSTP1 and GSTM1 modify the adjuvant
effect of diesel exhaust particles on allergic inflammation. They
challenged ragweed-sensitive patients intranasally with allergen alone
and with allergen plus diesel exhaust particles and found that
individuals with GSTM1 null or GSTP1 ile105 wildtype genotypes showed
significant increases in IgE and histamine after challenge with diesel
exhaust particles and allergens; the increase was largest in patients
with both the GSTP1 ile/ile and GSTM1 null genotypes.

Hashimoto et al. (2005) studied the role of the functional ile105-to-val
GSTP1 polymorphism in the pathogenesis of methamphetamine abuse (see
606581). They noted that individuals with the G allele (valine) are
expected to have decreased GST detoxification. Based on the role of GSTs
in the antioxidant system, they reasoned that variant GST alleles might
lead to an excess of metabolic products of oxidative processes induced
by methamphetamine, leading to neurotoxicity, including damage to the
dopaminergic neurons. They genotyped 189 methamphetamine abusers and 199
controls and analyzed the association of the polymorphism with features
of methamphetamine dependence, including psychosis, propensity for
relapse, and polysubstance abuse. The results suggested that the
ile105-to-val polymorphism in exon 5 of the GSTP1 gene may contribute to
a vulnerability to psychosis associated with methamphetamine abuse in a
Japanese population (p = 0.014; odds ratio, 1.84, 95% CI, 1.13-2.97).

Wilk et al. (2006) presented evidence suggesting that exposure to
herbicides may be an effect modifier of the relationship between GSTP1
polymorphisms and age of onset in Parkinson disease.

codon 114. (Ali-Osman et al. (1997) had designated the substitutions
ILE104 and ALA113 based on then-current numbering.)

611589	TITLE *611589 PATATIN-LIKE PHOSPHOLIPASE DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 5; PNPLA5
;;GS2-LIKE PROTEIN; GS2L
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Human patatin-like phospholipases, such as PNPLA5, have been implicated
in regulation of adipocyte differentiation and have been induced by
metabolic stimuli (Wilson et al., 2006).

CLONING

By database analysis, followed by screening of human EST databases,
Wilson et al. (2006) identified PNPLA5, which encodes a 429-amino acid
protein containing a patatin-like domain and 2 glycosaminoglycan sites.
Structural analysis determined that the patatin-like domain was composed
of a beta-sheet sandwiched by alpha-helices in approximately 3 layers.
Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that PNPLA5 was expressed at
moderate levels in brain and at very low levels in liver.

GENE FUNCTION

Gao and Simon (2007) measured retinol transacylation activity and found
that PNPLA5 appeared to inhibit transacylation catalyzed by endogenous
enzymes, but it had measurable retinylester hydrolysis activity.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PNPLA5
gene to chromosome 22 (TMAP G65439).

;;POMZP3 FUSION PROTEIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Kipersztok et al. (1995) characterized an unusual human gene, which they
termed POMZP3, that appears to have resulted from a fusion of sequences
derived from 2 distinct loci. The 5-prime end of the gene has 77%
identity to the 5-prime end of the coding region of the rat POM121 gene,
which had been characterized as a nuclear pore membrane protein. The
3-prime end of POMZP3 is 99% identical to the last 4 exons of the zona
pellucida glycoprotein gene ZP3 (182889). POMZP3 is presumably the
result of partial duplication of the human POM121 homolog and ZP3.
Unlike the true ZP3 locus, which is transcribed exclusively in the
ovary, POMZP3 is expressed in a variety of tissues.

MAPPING

Kipersztok et al. (1995) mapped the POMZP3 gene by fluorescence in situ
hybridization to chromosome 7q11.2.

;;SODIUM-DEPENDENT VITAMIN C TRANSPORTER 2; SVCT2;;
YOLK SAC PERMEASE-LIKE MOLECULE 2; YSPL2;;
KIAA0238
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The absorption of vitamin C into the body and its distribution to organs
requires the sodium-coupled vitamin C transporters SVCT1 (603790) and
SVCT2. SVCT1 is largely confined to epithelial surfaces involved in bulk
transport, such as those of the intestine and kidney, and is involved in
maintenance of whole-body homeostasis, through dietary absorption and
renal reabsorption. SVCT2 appears to account for tissue-specific uptake
of vitamin C. SVCT2 expression is widespread, occurring in neurons, the
endocrine system, bone, and other tissues, thus protecting metabolically
active tissues from oxidative stress (Hediger, 2002 and Savini et al.,
2008).

CLONING

During investigation of the importance of L-ascorbic acid transport in
regulating the supply and metabolism of vitamin C, Tsukaguchi et al.
(1999) isolated a 6.5-kb cDNA encoding a 592-amino acid protein, SVCT2,
from a rat brain cDNA library. This protein exhibits 65% amino acid
identity with rat SVCT1. SVCT2 is expressed in a host of metabolically
active cells and specialized tissues in the brain, eye, and other
organs. SVCT2 has 12 transmembrane domains, 2 possible sites for
N-glycosylation, and multiple potential phosphorylation sites.

As part of a project of sequencing human cDNA clones that correspond to
relatively long and nearly full-length transcripts, Nagase et al. (1996)
cloned KIAA0238, a 5,608-bp cDNA encoding a protein of 330 amino acids.
Tsukaguchi et al. (1999) determined that rat SVCT2 shares 84% amino acid
identity with KIAA0238 and stated that KIAA0238 may represent the human
homolog of SVCT2.

By searching for sequences similar to Aspergillus nidulans purine
transporters, followed by 5-prime RACE of a human kidney cDNA library,
Faaland et al. (1998) cloned SLC23A2, which they called YSPL2. The
deduced 650-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 70 kD.
It has 12 transmembrane domains, 2 blocks of similarity with
xanthine/uracil transporters, 2 potential N-glycosylation sites, and 3
putative phosphorylation sites. The N and C termini are predicted to be
intracellular. Northern blot analysis detected an 8-kb transcript in
heart, brain, placenta, liver, kidney, and pancreas. EST database
analysis indicated that YSPL2 is expressed in other human tissues and
cell types, particularly in fetal tissues.

Using SVCT1 (SLC23A1) to probe a human placenta cell line cDNA library,
Rajan et al. (1999) cloned SVCT2. Northern blot analysis detected a
major transcript of 7.5 kb highly expressed in brain, placenta, and
liver and more weakly expressed in heart, but not in lung or skeletal
muscle. Placenta expressed an additional transcript of 4.0 kb.

By PCR of a human fetal brain cDNA library, Lutsenko et al. (2004)
cloned a splice variant of SVCT2 that encodes a truncated protein
lacking the last 115 amino acids, including intracellular domains 5 and
6 and part of domain 4. PCR analysis detected the short variant in all
adult and fetal tissues examined. The long and short SVCT2 variants were
expressed in transfected human embryonic kidney cells as proteins of
about 80 and 70 kD, respectively.

By RT-PCR, Rubin et al. (2005) showed that several human cell lines
preferentially expressed SVCT2 from the exon 1b promoter compared to the
exon 1a promoter but that the ratio of preference varied widely.

GENE FUNCTION

By assaying transport activity in transfected human retinal pigment
epithelial cells, Rajan et al. (1999) showed that SVCT2 specifically
transported radiolabeled ascorbate, but not any other vitamin tested.
Transport was saturable and completely dependent upon extracellular Na+.
Kinetic analysis revealed that the relationship between ascorbate uptake
and Na+ concentration was sigmoidal, indicating that for every ascorbate
molecule transported, 2 Na+ ions were cotransported.

By cotransfection in human embryonic kidney cells, Lutsenko et al.
(2004) showed that the C-terminally truncated isoform of SVCT2 inhibited
ascorbic acid transport by the longer isoform in a dose-dependent manner
and that inhibition was due to direct protein-protein interaction
between the short and long variants. By examining the level of
endogenous short and long variants in human cell lines, Lutsenko et al.
(2004) found that the ability of cells to transport ascorbic acid was
inversely proportional to the amount of short isoform expressed.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rubin et al. (2005) identified alternative exons 1a and 1b of the
SLC23A2 gene that are separated by about 8.8 kb and have upstream
promoter sequences. The promoter upstream of exon 1b is TATA- and
CAAT-less and has a GC content of 73%. Rubin et al. (2005) identified
several specific transcription factor binding sites in both promoter
regions and determined that translation start site is in exon 3.

Savini et al. (2008) stated that the SLC23A2 gene contains 17 exons and
spans 158.4 kb.

MAPPING

By analysis of a radiation hybrid mapping panel, Nagase et al. (1996)
mapped the SLC23A2 gene to human chromosome 20. By genomic sequence
analysis, Faaland et al. (1998) mapped the SLC23A2 gene to chromosome
20p13-p12.

608457	TITLE *608457 CHROMOBOX HOMOLOG 7; CBX7
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening for mouse cDNAs that could extend the life span of cultured
normal human prostate primary epithelial cells, Gil et al. (2004) cloned
Cbx7. They cloned human CBX7 by searching databases for sequences
similar to mouse Cbx7 and by PCR of a human embryo cDNA library. CBX7
contains an N-terminal chromodomain and a C-terminal Pc box.
Phylogenetic analysis showed that CBX7 shares highest similarity with
CBX2 (602770), CBX4 (603079), CBX6, and CBX8. CBX7 mRNA was highly
expressed in brain, heart, kidney, and skeletal muscle, and weakly
expressed in peripheral blood leukocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

Gil et al. (2004) observed that, during serial passage of mouse
embryonic fibroblasts, expression of Cbx7 gradually decreased with
passage number and totally disappeared in senescent mouse embryonic
fibroblasts. Expression of either mouse or human CBX7 could extend the
cellular life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts and human cells by
downregulating expression of the Ink4a/Arf gene (CDKN2A; 600160).
Expression of human CBX7 mutants lacking the Pc box or with mutations in
critical residues of the chromodomain did not extend the life span of
cultured cells. CBX7 interacted with itself and with RING1 (602045) in
an in vitro pull-down assay, and CBX7 colocalized with RING1 in distinct
nuclear foci-like structures termed Pc bodies.

By database and immunohistochemical analyses, Scott et al. (2007)
detected high expression of CBX7 in germinal center lymphocytes and
germinal center-derived follicular lymphomas, where elevated expression
correlated with high MYC (190080) expression and advanced tumor grade.
Using mice with lymphoid-specific expression of Cbx7, Scott et al.
(2007) showed that Cbx7, acting through Ink4a/Arf, cooperated with Myc
to promote aggressive B-cell lymphomagenesis. They concluded that
CBX7-mediated repression of INK4A/ARF transcription is important for
tumorigenesis.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the CBX7
gene to chromosome 22 (TMAP HSC0XA102).

which encode proteins involved in homologous recombination repair of DNA
damage (summary by Tambini et al., 1997).

CLONING

Thacker et al. (1995) fused the V79 hamster cell line irs1, which is a
repair-deficient mutant that shows hypersensitivity to a number of
different DNA-damaging agents (Jones et al., 1987), to normal human
cells, resulting in complementation of the defect. The resultant hybrids
were analyzed by Alu-PCR, chromosome painting, and DNA markers to map
the complementing gene, designated XRCC2, to a specific chromosome
region. The hybrid cells showed correction of sensitivity to both x-rays
and mitomycin C and contained human chromosome 7, often as their only
human component. Hybrids showing unstable retention of human chromosomes
were subcloned to show that loss of chromosome 7 and loss of resistance
to mitomycin C occurred concordantly. Two separate hybrids were found to
have a smaller piece of chromosome 7, and specific DNA probes and
microsatellite markers defined this as a contiguous region at 7q35-q36.
Hybrid irradiation-fusion methods were used to reduce further the size
of the complementing genomic region and to localize the gene to an
approximately 3- to 5-Mb region at 7q36.1.

Jones et al. (1995) mapped the XRCC2 gene to 7q36 by studying
complementation of the defect in the irs1 hamster cell line described by
Jones et al. (1987). Jones et al. (1995) formed somatic cell hybrids by
fusing irs1 cells with human lymphocytes and selecting for
complementation in medium containing concentrations of mitomycin C that
are toxic to irs1 cells but not their human fusion partners. Retention
of chromosome 7 or of the region 7q36 resulted in cells that were
resistant to mitomycin C.

Tambini et al. (1997) took the radiation reduction of human/hamster
hybrids further to locate the XRCC2 gene to a small genomic region
defined by a single microsatellite marker D7S483. Yeast artificial
chromosomes (YACs) carrying that marker were then fused to the irs1
hamster cell line and a YAC that carried the complementing gene was
identified. This YAC was used for direct cDNA selection experiments to
identify the XRCC2 gene. The gene was found to share homology with the
yeast RAD51 gene and its human homolog (179617), which are involved in
the recombinational repair of DNA damage. Strong support for the
candidacy of this gene as XRCC2 was obtained from its refined map
position and by the full complementation of irs1 sensitivity with a
40-kb cosmid carrying the gene. Tambini et al. (1997) noted that,
although the XRCC2 candidate gene on chromosome 7 showed homology to
yeast RAD51, it must be distinct from the human RAD51 homolog, which is
located on chromosome 15.

GENE FUNCTION

Johnson et al. (1999) demonstrated that XRCC2 is essential for the
efficient repair of DNA double-strand breaks by homologous recombination
between sister chromatids. Hamster cells deficient in XRCC2 showed a
more than 100-fold decrease in homologous recombination induced by
double-strand breaks compared with the parental cell line. This defect
was corrected to almost wildtype levels by transient transfection with a
plasmid expressing XRCC2. The repair defect in XRCC2 mutant cells
appeared to be restricted to recombinational repair because
nonhomologous end joining was normal. Johnson et al. (1999) concluded
that XRCC2 is involved in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks by
homologous recombination.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay, Braybrooke et al. (2000) identified a
direct interaction between XRCC2 and RAD51L3 (602954), and they
confirmed the interaction by pull-down assays between recombinant XRCC2
and endogenous RAD51L3 in HeLa cell extracts. Size-exclusion
chromatography followed by Western blot analysis suggested that the 2
proteins exist as a heterodimer of about 70 kD.

Masson et al. (2001) found that antibody directed against RAD51L3
immunoprecipitated a complex from HeLa cell lysates that included XRCC2,
RAD51B (RAD51L1; 602948), and RAD51C (602774), along with RAD51L3.
Interactions between these proteins were confirmed in pull-down assays
using recombinant proteins expressed in sf9 insect cells. Gel filtration
of the complexes indicated an apparent molecular mass of about 180 kD,
suggesting a 1:1:1:1 stoichiometry of the 4 subunits. Binding assays,
confirmed by electron microscopy, indicated that the purified complex
bound single-stranded or nicked DNA. This binding was dependent on
Mg(2+) but independent of ATP. The DNA-stimulated ATPase activity of the
complex was extremely low. Masson et al. (2001) also identified a
second, heterodimeric protein complex between RAD51C and XRCC3 (600675).
Using coprecipitation and multiple pull-down assays, Liu et al. (2002)
confirmed interaction between the same RAD51 paralogs in the same 2
distinct protein complexes.

In a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human brain cDNA library using XRCC2 as
bait, Kurumizaka et al. (2002) also found that RAD51L3 interacts
directly with XRCC2. Using a D-loop formation assay, they found that
RAD51L3 and XRCC2, coexpressed and purified from bacterial cultures,
catalyze homologous pairing between a single-stranded oligonucleotide
and a superhelical double-stranded DNA. Significant single- and
double-stranded DNA were bound by the complex in the absence of ATP, but
homologous pairing was dependent on ATP and Mg(2+). By electron
microscopy, they found that RAD51L3 and XRCC2 form a multimeric ring
structure in the absence of DNA, and they form filamentous structures in
the presence of single-stranded DNA.

MAPPING

Thacker et al. (1995) and Jones et al. (1995) mapped the XRCC2 gene to
chromosome 7q36.1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Kuschel et al. (2002) performed genetic association studies in a
population-based breast cancer case-control study analyzing
polymorphisms in 7 genes involved in DNA repair. The association of a
rare variant in XRCC2 (R188H) was marginally significant. In a
comparable English cohort, Rafii et al. (2002) found that carriage of
R188H was associated with breast cancer overall, and this association
was enhanced when younger-onset cases with a positive family history
were compared with older controls with no family history. Using
site-directed mutagenesis of XRCC2, Rafii et al. (2002) further showed
that nonconservative substitution or deletion of amino acid 188 of XRCC2
could significantly affect cellular sensitivity to DNA damage. The
authors hypothesized that subtle variation in DNA repair capacity may
influence cancer susceptibility in the population.

Loss of mismatch repair (MMR) leads to a complex mutator phenotype that
appears to drive the development of a subset of colon cancers (see
Peltomaki, 2001). Mohindra et al. (2002) showed that MMR-defective tumor
cell lines were defective in homologous recombination repair (HRR)
induced by DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). A frameshift mutation
(342delT) in XRCC2 found in the MMR-deficient uterine tumor cell line,
SKUT-1, conferred thymidine sensitivity when introduced into an
MMR-proficient line. Like other cells with defective XRCC2, SKUT-1 cells
were sensitive to mitomycin C, and MMR-proficient cells expressing the
mutant XRCC2 allele also became more sensitive to this agent. The
authors suggested that the thymidine sensitivity of MMR-deficient tumor
cell lines may be a consequence of defects in the homologous
recombination repair pathway. Mohindra et al. (2004) introduced 342delT
into HRR-proficient cells containing a recombination reporter substrate.
In 1 set of transfectants, expression of 342delT conferred sensitivity
to thymidine and mitomycin C and suppressed HRR induced at the
recombination reporter by thymidine, but not by DSBs. In a second set of
transfectants, expression of 342delT was accompanied by a decreased
level of full-length XRCC2, and these cells were defective in induction
of HRR by either thymidine or DSBs. Mohindra et al. (2004) concluded
that 342delT suppresses recombination induced by thymidine in a
dominant-negative manner, while recombination induced by DSBs appears to
depend upon the level of XRCC2, as well as expression of the mutant
XRCC2 allele. The authors suggested that HRR pathways responding to
stalled replication forks or DSBs are genetically distinguishable and
that XRCC2 has a critical role in HRR at replication forks, possibly in
the loading of RAD51 onto gapped DNA.

Park et al. (2012) performed an exome-sequencing study of families with
multiple breast cancer-affected individuals and identified 2 families
with mutations, 1 with a protein-truncating mutation and 1 with a
probable deleterious missense mutation in the XRCC2 gene. Park et al.
(2012) then performed a population-based case-control mutation screening
study that identified 6 probably pathogenic coding variants in 1,308
cases with early-onset breast cancer and no variants in 1,120 controls
(the severity grading was p less than 0.02). They then performed
additional mutation screening in 689 multiple-case families and
identified 10 breast cancer-affected families with protein-truncating or
probably deleterious rare missense variants in XRCC2.

ANIMAL MODEL

Deans et al. (2000) found that most homozygous Xrcc2-null mice die
midgestation. The few mice that survived to later stages showed
developmental abnormalities and died at birth. Neonatal lethality,
apparently due to respiratory failure, was associated with a high
frequency of apoptotic death of postmitotic neurons in the developing
brain, leading to abnormal cortical structure. Embryonic cells showed
genetic instability, revealed by a high level of chromosomal
aberrations, and were sensitive to gamma-rays. The findings demonstrated
that homologous recombination has an important role in endogenous damage
repair in the developing embryo.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
XRCC2, ARG215TER

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to Fanconi anemia (see 227650) has not been confirmed.

In a 2.5-year-old boy, born of consanguineous Saudi Arabian parents,
with Fanconi anemia, Shamseldin et al. (2012) identified a homozygous
643C-T transition in the XRCC2 gene, resulting in an arg215-to-ter
(R215X) substitution predicted to remove the C terminus and abolish
XRCC2 activity. The mutation was found by whole-exome sequencing
followed by autozygome filtering. At birth, he showed microcephaly, left
facial nerve palsy, and bilaterally absent thumbs. Further investigation
showed ectopic left kidney and patent ductus arteriosus, and radiographs
showed complete absence bilaterally of the first metacarpal and scaphoid
bones, absent left radius, and hypoplastic right radius. Growth was
continuously poor. Chromosome testing in patient fibroblasts showed a
marked increase in the frequency of dsDNA breaks in response to damage,
indicating a defect in homologous recombination repair. Complementation
studies were not performed. Shamseldin et al. (2012) noted the
phenotypic similarities to Xrcc2-null mice (Deans et al., 2000).

607754	TITLE *607754 MAKORIN 1; MKRN1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The Makorin ring finger protein-1 gene (MKRN1) is a highly transcribed,
intron-containing source for a family of intronless mammalian genes
encoding a novel class of zinc finger proteins. Phylogenetic analyses
indicate that the MKRN1 gene is the ancestral founder of this gene
family (Gray et al., 2000).

CLONING

Gray et al. (2000) cloned MKRN1 orthologs from human, mouse, wallaby,
chicken, fruit fly, and nematode, underscoring the age and conservation
of this gene. The human MKRN1 cDNA contains a contiguous sequence of
3,026 basepairs including an open reading frame (ORF) from nucleotide
121 to 1567 that encodes a putative protein of 482 amino acids. Mouse
and Drosophila Mkrn1 proteins share 92% and 27% with the human protein,
respectively, with Drosophila Mkrn1 reaching 63% identity over 123 amino
acids spanning from upstream of the RING finger through the C-terminal
C3H zinc finger. Northern blot analysis of human tissues detected a
single prominent 3.2-kb transcript, suggesting that the MKRN1 gene is
highly and uniformly expressed in all tissues, including different
regions of the brain. High levels were observed in murine embryonic
nervous system and adult testis.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a yeast 2-hybrid system, Kim et al. (2005) found that MKRN1
interacts with a C-terminal domain of TERT (187270), the catalytic
subunit of the telomerase ribonucleoprotein. They demonstrated that
MKRN1 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, promoting TERT ubiquitination
and proteasomal degradation. Mutation of his307 of MKRN1 or deletion of
its C-terminal RING finger domain inactivated the enzyme. Overexpression
of MKRN1 in telomerase-positive human cells decreased telomerase
activity and reduced telomere length. Kim et al. (2005) concluded that
MKRN1 plays a negative role in telomere homeostasis.

GENE FAMILY

The MKRN gene family encodes putative ribonuclear proteins with a
distinctive array of zinc finger motifs, including 2 to 4 C3H zinc
fingers, an unusual cys/his arrangement that may represent a novel zinc
finger structure, and a highly conserved RING zinc finger. Gray et al.
(2000) provided a summary of 9 MKRN family loci distributed throughout
the human genome.

GENE STRUCTURE

The MKRN1 gene consists of 8 exons and spans approximately 28 kb (Gray
et al., 2000).

MAPPING

By FISH and interspecific backcross analysis, respectively, Gray et al.
(2000) determined that the human and mouse MKRN1 loci map to a conserved
syntenic group proximal to the T-cell receptor-beta cluster (TCRB; see
186930) in chromosome 7q34-q35 in human and chromosome 6A in mouse.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hirotsune et al. (2003) reported that transgenic disruption of a
putative pseudogene, Mkrn1-p1, resulted in destabilization of Mkrn1 mRNA
in trans and generated a phenotype with polycystic kidneys and bone
deformity. Gray et al. (2006) were unable to replicate the findings of
Hirotsune et al. (2003). They showed that 5-prime Mkrn1-p1 is fully
methylated on both alleles, indicative of silenced chromatin, and that
Mkrn1-p1 is not transcribed and therefore cannot stabilize Mkrn1
transcripts in trans. They determined that the putative Mkrn1-p1
reported by Hirotsune et al. (2003) is actually a short splice variant
of the Mkrn1 gene. Mice in which Mkrn1 had been directly disrupted
showed none of the phenotypes attributed by Hirotsune et al. (2003) to a
partial reduction of an Mkrn1 isoform. In addition, Gray et al. (2006)
found that Mkrn1-p1 appeared specific to mouse; it was not found in any
other species, including rat.

609294	TITLE *609294 SEMAPHORIN 6C; SEMA6C
;;KIAA1869
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2001) cloned SEMA6C, which they designated
KIAA1869. The deduced protein contains 755 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected high expression in skeletal muscle and relatively low
expression in whole adult brain and pancreas. Expression was
intermediate in fetal brain and in all other tissues and specific adult
brain regions examined.

By searching a fetal liver cDNA library for sequences similar to rat
Sema6c, followed by PCR and 5-prime RACE of a human brain cDNA library,
Qu et al. (2002) cloned 3 SEMA6C splice variants. The longest deduced
protein, designated SEMA6C.1, has 962 amino acids and a calculated
molecular mass of 104.3 kD. SEMA6C.1 contains an N-terminal signal
sequence, followed by a SEMA domain, a PSI domain, a transmembrane
segment, and a proline-rich C terminus. SEMA6C.1 also has 3 potential
N-glycosylation sites. SEMA6C.2 contains 930 amino acids and has a
deletion between the extracellular PSI domain and the transmembrane
domain. SEMA6C.3 contains 922 amino acids and has an incomplete SEMA
domain. Northern blot analysis detected a major transcript of 4.0 kb and
a second transcript of 6.0 kb. Expression was high in skeletal muscle,
moderate in heart, brain, and kidney, low in liver and placenta, and
barely detectable in other tissues examined. In situ hybridization of
mouse embryos detected Sema6c expression beginning at embryonic day 13,
with widespread expression in brain and spinal cord. Labeling of
cultured rat spinal cord neurons showed expression in neural perikaryon,
processes, and termini, but no labeling of nuclei or axons. Transient
transfection of SEMA6C.1 in COS-7 cells resulted in expression of a
cytoplasmic protein of about 62.5 kD and a secreted protein of about 75
kD, suggesting modification after secretion. SEMA6C.1 was also expressed
on the cell surface. Both SEMA6C.3 and a SEMA6C.1 mutant lacking the PSI
domain were expressed in a punctate cytoplasmic distribution, with
accumulation at the 2 ends of many cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Qu et al. (2002) exposed chicken embryo dorsal root ganglion explants
and neonatal rat cortical and hippocampal neurons to SEMA6C secreted
from transfected COS-7 cells and found that SEMA6C induced growth cone
collapse. SEMA6C also inhibited axonal extension in a nerve growth
factor (NGF; see 162030)-differentiated rat pheochromocytoma cell line.

GENE STRUCTURE

Qu et al. (2002) determined that the SEMA6C contains at least 20 exons
and spans about 15 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2001) mapped the SEMA6C
gene to chromosome 10. However, Qu et al. (2002) mapped the SEMA6C gene
to chromosome 1q12-q21.1 by genomic sequence analysis. The International
Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SEMA6C gene to chromosome
1 (TMAP RH47819).

Qu et al. (2002) mapped the mouse Sema6c gene to chromosome 16.

606001	TITLE *606001 INTERLEUKIN 32; IL32
;;NATURAL KILLER CELL TRANSCRIPT 4; NK4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

IL32 stimulates monocytic cells to produce various proinflammatory
cytokines and chemokines through the NF-kappa-B (see 164011) and p38
MAPK (MAPK14; 600289) inflammatory signal pathway (Choi et al., 2008).

CLONING

Interleukin-2 (IL2; 147680) treatment of natural killer (NK) cells
results in a strong proliferative response, cytokine production,
upregulation of IL2R (e.g., 147730), and transcripts encoding the serine
proteases granzyme A (140050) and granzyme B (123910). By differential
screening of an IL2-activated human NK cell-derived cDNA library, Dahl
et al. (1992) identified a cDNA encoding NK4. The deduced 234-amino acid
protein contains a signal sequence, a tyrosine sulfation site, 3
potential N-myristoylation sites, multiple putative phosphorylation
sites, and an RGD cell-attachment sequence, but no N-glycosylation
sites. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a 1.0-kb transcript
in activated NK and T cells, but no expression was detected in B cells
or fibroblasts. Southern blot and sequence analyses indicated variable
expression of NK4 in different individuals, suggesting that the NK4 gene
is polymorphic. SDS-PAGE analysis showed expression of a 27-kD protein,
in agreement with the predicted size.

Using Northern blot analysis, Bernot et al. (1998) detected ubiquitous
expression of NK4.

Using microarray analysis to screen an IL18 (600953)-stimulated human
lung carcinoma clone in which a stably expressed IL18RB gene (IL18RAP;
147811) had been inserted, Kim et al. (2005) identified several cytokine
genes, including IL32. Database analysis and RT-PCR of NK cells revealed
the existence of 4 IL32 splice variants: IL32-alpha, -beta, and -delta,
which are novel, and IL32-gamma, the longest variant, which is identical
to NK4. IL32 has 3 potential N-myristoylation sites and 1
N-glycosylation site, but it has no N-terminal hydrophobic signal
peptide. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.2-kb transcript in several
tissues, with more prominent expression in immune system tissues.
Western blot analysis showed IL32 in supernatants of the lung carcinoma
cell line expressing IL18RB after IL18 stimulation.
Electrochemiluminescence analysis showed that IL32-beta was more
efficiently secreted than IL32-alpha.

GENE FUNCTION

Kim et al. (2005) found that recombinant IL32 stimulated production of
large amounts of TNF (191160). NK cells stimulated with either IL12 or
IL18, or with a combination of both, induced IL32 independent of IFNG
(147570) production. Kim et al. (2005) proposed that IL32 may be
involved in inflammatory/autoimmune diseases, given that it can be
induced in lymphocytes as well as epithelial cells.

Using IL32-alpha in agarose ligand affinity chromatography analysis of
concentrated urinary proteins, Novick et al. (2006) isolated
proteinase-3 (PR3, or PRTN3; 177020). Surface plasmon resonance analysis
showed that urinary and neutrophil PR3 had similar binding affinities
for IL32-alpha, and IL32-alpha binding did not require PR3 enzymatic
activity. However, limited PR3-mediated cleavage of IL32-alpha resulted
in stronger induction of Mip2 (CXCL2; 139110) in murine macrophages and
IL8 (146930) in human mononuclear cells. Novick et al. (2006) proposed
that inhibition of PR3 activity or IL32 neutralization by inactive PR3
may reduce the consequences of IL32 activity in immune-regulated
diseases.

Using IL32-alpha in agarose ligand affinity chromatography analysis of
concentrated urinary proteins, Novick et al. (2006) isolated a 30-kd
protein, identified by mass spectrometry and confirmed by N-terminal
microsequencing as PR3 (177020). Surface plasmon resonance analysis
determined that binding affinity is comparable for urinary and
neutrophil PR3 and does not require enzymatic activity. However, limited
PR3-mediated cleavage of IL32-alpha results in stronger induction of
Mip2 from murine macrophages and IL8 in human mononuclear cells. Novick
et al. (2006) proposed that inhibition of PR3 activity, or IL32
neutralization, may reduce the consequences of IL32 activity in immune
regulated diseases.

Using immunohistochemical analysis, Joosten et al. (2006) found that
IL32 was highly expressed in synovial tissues of rheumatoid arthritis
(RA; 180300) patients, but it was absent in synovium from osteoarthritis
(165720) patients. In synovial tissues of RA patients with active
disease, IL32 levels correlated strongly with the erythrocyte
sedimentation rate, a marker of systemic inflammation, as well as with
indices of synovial inflammation and with the presence of synovial TNF,
IL1B (147720), and IL18. IL32 potently induced prostaglandin E2 release
in both mouse macrophages and human monocytes. Injection of IL32-gamma
into mouse knee joints resulted in joint swelling, influx of
inflammatory cells, and cartilage damage. These outcomes were at least
partially dependent on Tnf, because Tnf -/- mice showed only loss of
proteoglycan, but no swelling or strong inflammatory cell influx, after
IL32 injection. Joosten et al. (2006) proposed that IL32 plays a role in
RA and may be a novel target in the treatment of autoimmune disease.

Marcondes et al. (2008) found that a leukemia cell line resistant to
TNF-mediated apoptosis became sensitive to TNF-mediated apoptosis upon
coculture and contact with marrow-derived stroma cell lines expressing
high levels of IL32. Apoptosis was abrogated when stroma cells were
treated with small interfering RNA against IL32. Marrow stroma and NK
cells from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) expressed high
levels of IL32 compared with controls, whereas marrow stroma and NK
cells from patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML)
expressed low levels of IL32 compared with controls. Marcondes et al.
(2008) proposed that IL32 has a role in the pathophysiology of clonal
myeloid diseases and distinguishes MDS from CMML.

Netea et al. (2008) found that IL32-gamma induced differentiation of
human blood monocytes and THP1 leukemic cells into macrophages-like
cells. IL32-alpha also induced differentiation, but at higher
concentrations. IL32-induced differentiation was augmented by bacterial
muramyl dipeptide, the ligand for NOD2 (605956). IL32-gamma also
reversed GMCSF (CSF2; 138960)/IL4 (147780)-induced differentiation of
monocytes to dendritic cells, with these cells also becoming
macrophage-like cells. Whereas IL32 induction of TNF, IL1B, and IL6
(147620) requires p38, IL32-induced monocyte-to-macrophage
differentiation required CASP3 (600636). Netea et al. (2008) concluded
that IL32 induces not only secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, but
also differentiation of monocytes to macrophages. They proposed that
IL32 may function against intracellular organisms, such as Mycobacterium
tuberculosis.

Choi et al. (2008) showed that all 4 isoforms of IL32 were active in
multiple bioassays and reacted with soluble PR3. Greatest activity was
observed for IL32-gamma.

Bai et al. (2010) found that silencing IL32 with short hairpin RNA in a
human macrophage line significantly decreased induction of the
proinflammatory cytokines TNF, IL1B, and IL8 by Myobacterium
tuberculosis infection and increased the number of cell-associated
bacteria. Stimulating the cells with recombinant IL32 enhanced apoptosis
induced by M. tuberculosis compared with cells infected with M.
tuberculosis alone. Depletion of IL32 abrogated apoptosis induced by M.
tuberculosis with a concomitant decrease in CASP3 activation. Treatment
with recombinant IL32 reduced the number of bacteria, and the reduction
was attenuated by treatment with a CASP3 inhibitor. Bai et al. (2010)
concluded that IL32 has a role in host defense against M. tuberculosis.

Zepp et al. (2011) found that recombinant IL32-gamma protected human
epithelial WISH cells from vesicular stomatitis virus-induced cell death
and reduced viral load. Silencing of IL32 showed that antiviral
responses, such as IFNA (147660) release, triggered by synthetic analogs
of single-stranded or, particularly, double-stranded RNA viruses were
weaker in both WISH cells and peripheral blood cells. IL32 also
antagonized herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2 in monkey kidney cells and in
human umbilical cord endothelial cells, as HSV-2 production increased
upon IL32 silencing. IL32 activity was mediated through the PKR
(EIF2AK2; 176871)-EIF2-alpha (EIF2S1; 603907) and MXA (MX1; 147150)
antiviral pathways. Inhibition of IFN activity reduced IL32 antiviral
activity only moderately. Zepp et al. (2011) concluded that IL32 plays a
central role in immune responses to both RNA and DNA viruses.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Bernot et al. (1998) determined that the
NK4 gene contains 6 exons.

Kim et al. (2005) determined that the IL32 gene spans approximately 5 kb
and contains 8 small exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Bernot et al. (1998) mapped the IL32 gene
to chromosome 16p13.3, near the familial Mediterranean fever (FMF;
249100) locus (see 608107).

;;IMMUNOGLOBULIN AND PROLINE-RICH RECEPTOR 1; IGPR1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TMIGD2 is widely expressed on the plasma membrane of endothelial and
epithelial cells and contributes to cell adhesion and migration (Rahimi
et al., 2012).

CLONING

By searching databases for genes encoding proteins with an
immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain, Rahimi et al. (2012) identified TMIGD2,
which they called IGPR1. The deduced 282-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 31 kD. It contains an N-terminal signal
sequence, followed by an extracellular Ig-like domain, a transmembrane
domain, and a cytoplasmic proline-rich C-terminal domain. The N-terminal
extracellular region contains 2 putative glycosylation sites. The Ig
domain was predicted to assume an Ig V (variable) fold structure.
Orthologs of IGPR1 were detected in several mammalian species, but not
in rat or mouse. Quantitative PCR revealed high IGPR1 expression in
artery, vein, and brain, with low to moderate expression in other
tissues. Western blot analysis detected an IGPR1 protein with an
apparent molecular mass of 55 kD in thymus, placenta, heart, small
intestine, skin, and kidney. An IGPR1 protein with an apparent molecular
mass of 35 kD was expressed in skeletal muscle, brain, colon, lung, and
ovary. Immunohistochemical analysis showed IGPR1 expression mainly in
epithelial and endothelial cells, and IGPR1 was expressed on the plasma
membrane of transfected porcine aorta endothelial cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Rahimi et al. (2012) found that overexpression of IGPR1 in porcine or
human endothelial cells increased tube formation in 3-dimensional
cultures. IGPR1 overexpression also increased angiogenesis in mouse
melanoma cells following injection into mice. In contrast, knockdown of
IGPR1 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells reduced capillary tube
formation. IGPR1 overexpression also altered adhesion, migration, and
morphology of actin stress fibers in transfected cells. Protein
interaction assays revealed that the isolated proline-rich cytoplasmic
region of IGPR1 interacted with SH3 domains in several proteins, notably
SPIN90 (NCKIPSD; 606671). In porcine or human endothelial cells,
overexpression or knockdown of SPIN90 increased and decreased,
respectively, tube formation in 3-dimensional culture. Rahimi et al.
(2012) hypothesized that interaction between IGPR1 and SPIN90 regulates
angiogenesis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rahimi et al. (2012) reported that the TMIGD2 gene contains at least 4
exons.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the TMIGD2 gene to chromosome 19p13.3 based on an
alignment of the TMIGD2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC015655) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

MULTIDRUG RESISTANCE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; MRP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Cole et al. (1992) identified a transporter protein whose gene is
overexpressed in a multidrug-resistant variant of the small cell lung
cancer cell line NCI-H69. Unlike most tumor cell lines that are
resistant to multiple chemotherapeutic agents, it did not overexpress
the transmembrane transport protein P-glycoprotein (MDR1; 171050). Cole
et al. (1992) isolated cDNA clones corresponding to mRNAs overexpressed
in the resistant H69 cells. One cDNA hybridized to an mRNA of 7.8 to 8.2
kb that was expressed 100- to 200-fold higher in the resistant cells
than in the drug-sensitive H69 cells. Overexpression was associated with
amplification of the cognate gene. The cDNA contained a single open
reading frame of 1,522 amino acids encoding a protein that they
designated MRP, for 'multidrug resistance-associated protein.' (Cole and
Deeley (1993) corrected the predicted protein sequence to 1,531 amino
acids.) Database analyses demonstrated similarities in primary sequence
to the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily
of transport systems. Included in this superfamily are the genes for
MDR1 and for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
(CFTR; 602421). Northern blot analysis readily detected MRP transcripts
in lung, testis, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells; MRP transcripts
were below the level of detection in placenta, brain, kidney, salivary
gland, uterus, liver, and spleen.

GENE FUNCTION

Zaman et al. (1994) described experiments leading them to conclude that
MRP is a plasma membrane drug-efflux pump.

Lorico et al. (2002) showed that glutathione is a cofactor in
MRP-mediated resistance to heavy metal oxyanions: human fibrosarcoma
cells overexpressing MRP1 together with the heavy (catalytic) subunit of
gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (606857) showed increased resistance
to sodium arsenite and antimony toxicity.

Using flow cytometric analysis, Muller et al. (2002) found that when a
FLAG epitope was introduced into the extracellular loops of
membrane-spanning domain-1 (MSD1) or MSD3 of MRP1, it was accessible on
the cell surface upon removal of N-glycosylation sites. In contrast,
FLAG epitope inserted into MSD2 was not accessible even after removal of
all 3 N-glycosylation sites, indicating that MSD2 is deeply buried in
the plasma membrane.

Using RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, Pascolo et al. (2003) found that
MRP1 and MRP3 (ABCC3; 604323) were highly expressed in placenta, but
only MRP1 was highly expressed in a trophoblastic cell line. MRP2
(ABCC2; 601107) and MRP5 (ABCC5; 605251) were only weakly expressed in
placenta and the trophoblastic cell line. Third-trimester placenta
expressed more MRP1 than first-trimester placenta. MRP1 expression
increased markedly in the trophoblastic cell line upon polarization.
Pascolo et al. (2003) concluded that MRP1 expression increases with
trophoblast maturation.

In cultured mouse astrocytes, Gennuso et al. (2004) found that
unconjugated bilirubin induced increased expression and transient
redistribution of Mrp1 from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane
and throughout the cytoplasm. Blocking Mrp1 efflux pumps increased the
susceptibility of the cells to the toxic effects of unconjugated
bilirubin, suggesting that Mrp1 is an important protector in this
scenario. The authors noted the relevance of the findings to neonatal
encephalopathy caused by increased bilirubin.

Mitra et al. (2006) found that sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) was
released from mast cells independently of degranulation. S1P secretion
was dependent on ABCC1, but not on ABCB1 (171050), and inhibition of
ABCC1 blocked both constitutive and antigen-stimulated S1P release.
Chemotaxis assays showed that ABCC1-mediated transport of S1P influenced
mast-cell migration, but not mast-cell degranulation.

The reactivation of latent human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection after
transplantation is associated with high morbidity and mortality. In
vivo, myeloid cells and their progenitors are an important site of HCMV
latency, whose establishment and/or maintenance require expression of
the viral transcript UL138. Weekes et al. (2013) used stable isotope
labeling by amino acids in cell culture-based mass spectrometry to
identify a dramatic UL138-mediated loss of cell surface MRP1 and the
reduction of substrate export by this transporter. Latency-associated
loss of MRP1 and accumulation of the cytotoxic drug vincristine, an MRP1
substrate, depleted virus from naturally latent CD14+ (158120) and CD34+
(142230) progenitors, all of which are in vivo sites of latency. Weekes
et al. (2013) concluded that the UL138-mediated loss of MRP1 provides a
marker for detecting latent HCMV infection and a therapeutic target for
eliminating latently infected cells before transplantation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Grant et al. (1997) defined the intron/exon structure of MRP and
characterized a number of splicing variants of MRP mRNA. The gene spans
at least 200 kb. It contains 31 exons and a high proportion of class 0
introns, alternative splicing of which results in significant levels of
variant transcripts that maintain the original open reading frame of MRP
mRNA. (A class 0 splice occurs between 2 codons, e.g., ATG/ATG =
Met.Met. A class 1 splice would be ATGA/TG and a class 2 splice would be
ATGAT/G.) Analyses of the conservation of intron/exon organization and
protein primary structure suggested that the MRP-related transporters
evolved from a common ancestor shared with CFTR by fusion with 1 or more
genes encoding polytopic membrane proteins.

MAPPING

By isotopic in situ hybridization, Cole et al. (1992) mapped the MRP1
gene to chromosome 16p13.1. Grant et al. (1997) located the MRP1 gene
close to the short arm breakpoint of the pericentric inversion
associated with the M4Eo subclass of acute myeloid leukemia and on the
telomeric side of the MYH11 gene (160745).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using PCR-SSCP analysis, Conrad et al. (2001) screened 36 Caucasian
volunteers for mutations in the coding exons of the MRP1 gene, including
the adjacent intron sequences. Among several changes found, 2 were
predicted to cause amino acid substitutions. One of these mutations,
G671V, was of special interest because it is located near the first
nucleotide-binding domain. To determine whether this mutation caused a
change in the MRP1 phenotype, a mutant MRP1 expression vector was
constructed and transfected into SV40-transformed human embryonic kidney
cells and the transport properties of the mutant protein were examined.
With the substrates studied, the mutant showed no differences in organic
anion transport activities compared to wildtype MRP1.

Wang et al. (2005) scanned for genomic signatures of recent positive
selection in MRP1 in approximately 480 individuals sampled from the
Chinese, Malay, Indian, European American, and African American
populations. The genetic profile of SNPs at this locus revealed high
haplotype diversity and weak linkage disequilibrium (LD). Despite this
weak LD, the G allele of the -260G-C SNP (dbSNP rs4148330) in the
promoter region of the MRP1 gene, which was contained within a
high-frequency haplotype, exhibited extended haplotype homozygosity
across 135 kb in European Americans. Long-range haplotype and F(st)
statistic tests showed evidence of positive selection for the G allele
in the European American population. An MRP1 promoter-reporter assay
showed significantly lower activity for the G allele-containing promoter
when compared with the C allele-containing promoter in all 4 cell lines
tested (P = less than 0.01). Wang et al. (2005) suggested that dbSNP
rs4148330 may account, in part, for interindividual variations and
population differences in drug response.

ANIMAL MODEL

Robbiani et al. (2000) showed that migration of dendritic cells (DCs)
from skin to lymph nodes utilizes the leukotriene C4 (LTC4; see 246530)
transporter MRP1. DC mobilization from the epidermis and trafficking
into lymphatic vessels was greatly reduced in Mrp1 -/- mice, but
migration was restored by exogenous cysteinyl leukotrienes LTC4 or LTD4.
In vitro, these cysteinyl leukotrienes promoted optimal chemotaxis to
the chemokine CCL19 (SCYA19; 602227) but not to other related
chemokines. Antagonism of CCL19 in vivo prevented DC migration out of
the epidermis. Thus, the authors concluded that MRP1 regulates DC
migration to lymph nodes, apparently by transporting LTC4, which in turn
promotes chemotaxis to CCL19 and mobilization of DCs from the epidermis.

Schultz et al. (2001) showed that Mrp1-deficient mice had diminished
outgrowth of Streptococcus pneumoniae and strongly reduced mortality
compared with wildtype mice after intranasal infection. This advantage
could be abrogated by treatment with a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor. Mutant
mice had low levels of LTC4 in lung because of accumulation of
intracellular LTC4 and inhibition of LTC4 synthase. On the other hand,
they had a reduced inflammatory response and high levels of LTB4 (see
LTB4R2; 605773), which was associated with increased LTA4 hydrolase
(151570) activity and was required for the protective effect. Schultz et
al. (2001) suggested that MRP1 may be a novel target for adjunctive
therapy in pneumonia.

Lorico et al. (2002) found resistance to heavy metal oxyanion toxicity
in cell cultures overexpressing MRP1, but no increase in sensitivity to
sodium arsenite and antimony in Mrp1 -/- knockout mice. The authors
stated that the redundancy of transmembrane export pumps suggests that
other pump(s) may effectively vicariate for MRP1-mediated transport of
heavy metal oxyanions.

610606	TITLE *610606 CYTOPLASMIC POLYADENYLATION ELEMENT-BINDING PROTEIN 3; CPEB3
;;KIAA0940
CPEB3 RIBOZYME, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned CPEB3, which they designated
KIAA0940. RT-PCR ELISA detected high expression in brain, intermediate
expression in kidney, heart, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, testis,
ovary, pancreas, and fetal liver, and low expression in spleen and fetal
brain. CPEB3 was expressed in all specific adult brain regions examined,
with highest levels in amygdala and substantia nigra.

Salehi-Ashtiani et al. (2006) stated that CPEB3 transcripts use 2
alternate untranslated first exons, one expressed in liver and testis,
and the other expressed in brain. The 698-amino acid CPEB3 protein has
an N-terminal glutamine-rich domain, followed by 2 RNA recognition
motifs and a C-terminal zinc finger domain. The glutamine-rich domain is
not present in other CPEBs.

- CPEB3 Ribozyme

Using an in vitro self-selection technique, Salehi-Ashtiani et al.
(2006) identified self-cleaving ribozymes associated with olfactory
receptor OR4K15, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R; 147370),
a LINE-1 retrotransposon (see LRE1; 151626), and CPEB3. The CPEB3
ribozyme is located within intron 3 and is structurally related to
ribozymes from human hepatitis delta virus (HDV), a single-stranded RNA
satellite virus for hepatitis B infection (see 610424). EST database
analysis and RT-PCR of human and mouse total RNA extracts indicated that
the CPEB3 ribozyme is expressed and self-cleaves in vivo.
Salehi-Ashtiani et al. (2006) identified the CPEB3 ribozyme only in
mammalian vertebrates. They proposed that HDV ribozymes and the CPEB3
ribozyme are evolutionarily related, and that HDV arose from the human
transcriptome.

GENE FUNCTION

- CPEB3 Ribozyme

Salehi-Ashtiani et al. (2006) narrowed the active sequence of the CPEB3
ribozyme to 81 nucleotides. This 81-nucleotide construct cleaved to
produce a 9-nucleotide upstream fragment containing a 2-prime-to-3-prime
cyclic phosphate, and a 72-nucleotide downstream fragment containing a
5-prime terminal hydroxyl that could be phosphorylated with
polynucleotide kinase (PNKP; 605610). The ribozyme had a low Mg(2+)
requirement, and was also active in the presence of Mn(2+) and Ca(2+).
Ribozyme activity was almost constant between pH 5.5 and 8.5, suggesting
the presence of 2 functional groups.

GENE STRUCTURE

Salehi-Ashtiani et al. (2006) reported that the CPEB3 gene spans 242 kb
and contains 11 exons, including 2 alternatively spliced, untranslated
first exons. Intron 3 spans 46 kb and contains a ribozyme.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1999) mapped the CPEB3 gene
to chromosome 10.

600442	TITLE *600442 AQUAPORIN 5; AQP5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Aquaporin water channels, such as AQP5, play a fundamental role in
transmembrane water movement in plant and animal tissues (see AQP1;
107776).

CLONING

Since the molecular pathway by which water is secreted by salivary
glands was unknown, Raina et al. (1995) isolated cDNA from rat
submandibular gland by homology cloning. In vitro translation yielded a
27-kD polypeptide, and expression of the cRNA in Xenopus oocytes
conferred a 20-fold increase in osmotic water permeability, which was
reversibly inhibited by HgCl(2). Northern blot analysis demonstrated a
1.6-kb mRNA in submandibular, parotid, and sublingual salivary glands,
lacrimal gland, eye, trachea, and lung. In situ hybridization
demonstrated strong hybridization over the corneal epithelium of the eye
and over the secretory lobules in salivary glands. This member of the
mammalian aquaporin water channel family, designated AQP5, was
implicated in the generation of saliva, tears, and pulmonary secretions.

Lee et al. (1996) isolated and characterized the human AQP5 cDNA and
gene. The AQP5 cDNA from a human submaxillary gland library contained a
795-bp open reading frame encoding a 265-amino acid polypeptide. The
deduced amino acid sequences of human and rat AQP5 are 91% identical,
with 6 substitutions in the 22-amino acid COOH-terminal domain. Lee et
al. (1996) identified a transcription initiation site 518 bp upstream of
the initiating methionine.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Lee et al. (1996) mapped the AQP5
gene to chromosome 12q13. The AQP5 gene resides within a 7.4-kb
SalI-EcoRI restriction fragment. The homologous mouse gene was localized
to distal chromosome 15.

GENE FUNCTION

Lee et al. (1996) showed that microinjection of human AQP5 in Xenopus
oocytes conferred mercurial-sensitive osmotic water permeability
equivalent to other aquaporins.

Tsubota et al. (2001) examined the distribution of AQP5 in lacrimal
gland biopsy specimens. Healthy controls and patients with either
Mikulicz disease or non-Sjogren syndrome dry eye had the expected apical
distribution of AQP5 in lacrimal acinar cells. Patients with Sjogren
syndrome, however, had diffuse cytoplasmic staining for AQP5, with
almost no labeling at the apical membrane. Sodium channel and
sodium-potassium ATPase distribution were normal in all groups. Tsubota
et al. (2001) concluded that there is a selective defect in lacrimal
gland AQP5 trafficking in Sjogren syndrome that might contribute to
decreased lacrimation and dry eye in these patients.

Sidhaye et al. (2006) observed a dose-responsive decrease in Aqp5
abundance in mouse lung epithelial cells exposed to hypotonic medium.
Hypotonic reduction of Aqp5 was augmented and reduced, respectively, by
conditions that activated or inhibited Trpv4 (605427). Hypotonic
reduction of Aqp5 required extracellular calcium and was associated with
increased intracellular calcium. The response to hypotonicity was
recapitulated by coexpression of TRPV4 and AQP5 in human embryonic
kidney cells. Sidhaye et al. (2006) concluded that AQP5 abundance is
tightly controlled along a spectrum of extracellular osmolalities and
that its abundance in hypotonic conditions can be regulated by TRPV4
activation.

By immunohistochemistry, Blaydon et al. (2013) observed strong
localization of AQP5 to the plasma membrane in keratinocytes of the
stratum granulosum. Levels of AQP5 in the palmar epidermis were much
lower than those seen in cells of the sweat glands.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using linkage data in combination with exome sequencing followed by
Sanger sequencing in families segregating autosomal dominant diffuse
nonepidermolytic PPK (PPKB; 600231), Blaydon et al. (2013) identified
heterozygosity for 5 different missense mutations in the AQP5 gene
(600442.0001-600442.0005) in affected members of 7 Swedish families, 3
British families, and a Scottish family. The mutations all segregated
with disease in the respective families and were not found in the dbSNP
or 1000 Genomes Project databases. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed
that the mutant AQP5 variants retained the ability to traffic to the
plasma membrane; the analyses also showed an increase in levels of
acetylated alpha-tubulin (see 602529) in a patient palm biopsy compared
to a control palm, suggesting increased levels of microtubule
stabilization in diffuse NEPPK palmar epidermis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Ma et al. (2000) presented results from studies of Aqp5-null knockout
mice indicating that AQP5 is responsible for the majority of water
transport across the apical membrane of type I alveolar epithelial
cells. The unimpaired alveolar fluid clearance in Aqp5-null mice
indicated that high alveolar water permeability is not required for
active, near-isosmolar fluid transport. King et al. (2000) stated that 5
aquaporin-null phenotypes had been reported: AQP0, AQP1, AQP2, AQP4, and
AQP5.

Nejsum et al. (2002) studied the localization of AQPs 1 through 5 in rat
and mouse skin and sweat glands and investigated the potential roles of
AQPs in sweat secretion. The studies demonstrated that AQP5 resides in
plasma membranes of sweat secretory cells and is essential for sweat
secretion. Aqp5-null mice showed no apparent differences in the number
or morphologic appearance of sweat glands. However, these mice showed a
marked reduction in pilocarpine-induced sweat response. Nejsum et al.
(2002) raised the possibility that dysregulation of AQP5 in sweat glands
may contribute to the pathogenesis of hypohidrosis observed in patients
with Sjogren syndrome (270150) who show markedly decreased sweating in
response to methacholine stimulation. In contrast, hyperhidrosis
(144110) is a chronic idiopathic disorder of excessive sweating which
may affect the palms, axillae, soles, and face. They suggested that AQP5
inhibition may be a therapeutic option in these patients.

Two AQP water channels are expressed in mammalian cornea, AQP1 in
endothelial cells and AQP5 in epithelial cells. Thiagarajah and Verkman
(2002) examined the effect of Aqp1 or Aqp5 knockout in mice. Corneal
thickness in fixed sections was reduced in Aqp1 null mice and increased
in Aqp5 null mice. After exposure of the external corneal surface to
hypotonic saline, the rate of corneal swelling was reduced by Aqp5
deletion. After exposure of the endothelial surface to hypotonic saline
by anterior chamber perfusion, the rate of corneal swelling was reduced
by Aqp1 deletion. The recovery of corneal transparency and thickness
after hypotonic swelling was delayed in Aqp1 null mice. Thiagarajah and
Verkman (2002) concluded that AQP1 and AQP5 provide the principal routes
for corneal water transport across the endothelial and epithelial
barriers, respectively.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PALMOPLANTAR KERATODERMA, BOTHNIAN TYPE
AQP5, ALA38GLU

In affected individuals of 7 Swedish families with Bothnian-type diffuse
nonepidermolytic PPK (PPKB; 600231), including a family previously
studied by Lind et al. (1994), Blaydon et al. (2013) identified
heterozygosity for a c.113C-A transversion in exon 1 of the AQP5 gene,
resulting in an ala38-to-glu (A38E) substitution at a residue located on
the extracellular surface of the protein. The mutation segregated with
disease in each family and was not found in the dbSNP or 1000 Genomes
Project databases. Affected individuals carrying the A38E mutation all
shared the same haplotype, indicating that A38E represents a founder
mutation. In 1 of the Swedish families, however, most affected
individuals carried a different missense mutation in AQP5 (R188C;
600442.0002); the A38E founder mutation was present in only 1 branch of
the family and was inherited from an affected individual who married
into the family.

.0002
PALMOPLANTAR KERATODERMA, BOTHNIAN TYPE
AQP5, ARG188CYS

In affected individuals of a Swedish family with Bothnian-type diffuse
nonepidermolytic PPK (600231), Blaydon et al. (2013) identified
heterozygosity for a c.562C-T transition in exon 3 of the AQP5 gene,
resulting in an arg188-to-cys (R188C) substitution at a highly conserved
residue lining the extracellular end of the water channel. The mutation,
which was not found in the dbSNP or 1000 Genomes Project databases,
segregated with disease in most of the family. In 1 branch of the
family, however, affected individuals carried the A38E founder mutation
(600442.0001), which was inherited from an affected individual who
married into the family.

.0003
PALMOPLANTAR KERATODERMA, BOTHNIAN TYPE
AQP5, ILE45SER

In affected individuals of 2 families of British descent with
Bothnian-type diffuse nonepidermolytic PPK (600231), Blaydon et al.
(2013) identified heterozygosity for a c.134T-G transversion in exon 1
of the AQP5 gene, resulting in an ile45-to-ser (I45S) substitution at a
residue lining the extracellular end of the water channel. The mutation
segregated with disease in both families and was not found in the dbSNP
or 1000 Genomes Project databases.

.0004
PALMOPLANTAR KERATODERMA, BOTHNIAN TYPE
AQP5, ILE177PHE

In affected members of a large British family with Bothnian-type diffuse
nonepidermolytic PPK (600231), Blaydon et al. (2013) identified
heterozygosity for a c.529A-T transversion in exon 3 of the AQP5 gene,
resulting in an ile177-to-phe (I177F) substitution at a residue lining
the extracellular end of the water channel. The mutation segregated with
disease in the family and was not found in the dbSNP or 1000 Genomes
Project databases.

.0005
PALMOPLANTAR KERATODERMA, BOTHNIAN TYPE
AQP5, ASN123ASP

In affected members of a family from Scotland with Bothnian-type diffuse
nonepidermolytic PPK (600231), Blaydon et al. (2013) identified
heterozygosity for a c.367A-G transition in exon 2 of the AQP5 gene,
resulting in an asn123-to-asp (N123D) substitution at a residue located
on the extracellular surface of the protein. The mutation segregated
with disease in the family and was not found in the dbSNP or 1000
Genomes Project databases.

;;MOSAIC SERINE PROTEASE LONG; MSPL
MOSAIC SERINE PROTEASE SHORT, INCLUDED; MSPS, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Kim et al. (2001) used degenerate PCR to amplify trypsin-type serine
protease cDNA sequences from a human lung cDNA library. They identified
2 novel cDNAs encoding different serine protease isoforms, which they
designated mosaic serine protease long (MSPL) and mosaic serine protease
short (MSPS). MSPL encodes a deduced 581-amino acid protein, and MSPS
encodes a deduced 537-amino acid protein. Both isoforms contain 4
potential N-glycosylation sites. Except for the C-terminal ends, the 2
proteins have an identical serine protease domain exhibiting 42%, 39%,
and 43% identity to those of human plasma kallikrein (see 229000),
hepsin (142440), and transmembrane protease serine-2 (602060),
respectively. MSPL contains a transmembrane domain but MSPS does not.
The noncatalytic regions of both isoforms contain domains that may be
involved in protein-protein interactions, including tandem repeat motifs
corresponding to the phosphorylation sites of cyclin-dependent kinase
Cdc2 and protein kinase C, and a low density lipoprotein receptor-like
domain.

Using PCR-Southern analysis, Kim et al. (2001) detected expression of
both MSPL and MSPS in human lung, placenta, pancreas and prostate, but
not in brain, heart, liver, intestine, kidney, thymus, muscle, or ovary.
Low expression of MSPS was also detected in testis and peripheral blood
lymphocytes. Western blot analysis revealed bands of 60 kD and 57 kD,
corresponding to the predicted sizes for MSPL and MSPS, respectively.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the
TMPRSS13 gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP RH68429).

;;NUCLEAR SET DOMAIN-CONTAINING 3; NSD3
NSD3/NUP98 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By EST database searching with mouse Nsd1 (606681) and human NSD2
(WHSC1; 602952) as probe and screening of an amnion cell cDNA library,
Angrand et al. (2001) cloned a partial sequence for WHSC1L1, which they
called NSD3. They obtained the full-length cDNA by 5-prime RACE. The
deduced 1,437-amino acid protein contains 2 PWWP domains involved in
protein-protein interaction, 5 PHD-type zinc finger motifs found in
chromatin-associated proteins, a SAC (SET-associated cys-rich) domain, a
SET domain, and a C-terminal C5HCH domain. They also identified a
variant, arising from alternative polyadenylation and exon splicing,
that encodes a deduced 645-amino acid peptide. The short isoform
contains a single PWWP domain. By PCR analysis, Angrand et al. (2001)
found the 2 variants, as well as a third, 1,388-amino acid peptide, in
HeLa cells. WHSC1L1 shares 68% and 55% identity with mouse Nsd1 (606681)
and human WHSC1 (602952), respectively, over a 700-amino acid block
containing the SAC, SET, and C5HCH domains. Northern blot analysis
detected an 8.5-kb transcript in all tissues examined, with highest
expression in brain, heart, and skeletal muscle, and lower expression in
liver and lung.

GENE STRUCTURE

Angrand et al. (2001) determined that the WHSC1L1 gene contains 24 exons
and spans over 90 kb.

MAPPING

By FISH, Angrand et al. (2001) mapped the WHSC1L1 gene to chromosome
8p12. Stec et al. (2001) identified a pseudogene (WHSC1L2P) on
chromosome 17q21.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Rosati et al. (2002) described fusion between the NUP98 gene (601021)
and the NSD3 gene in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia associated
with t(8;11)(p11.2;p15). FISH analysis revealed a split of a specific
BAC which showed the fusion partner at 8p11.2 to be NSD3.

Remold-O'Donnell et al. (1992) cloned EI cDNA and identified 3 EI mRNA
species of 1.5, 1.9, and 2.6 kb in monocyte-like cells and no
hybridizing mRNA in lymphoblastoid cells lacking detectable EI enzymatic
activity. The cDNA open reading frame encoded a 379-amino acid protein.
Its sequence established EI as a member of the serpin superfamily.
Sequence alignment indicated that the reactive center P1 residue is
cys-344, consistent with abrogation of elastase inhibitory activity by
iodoacetamide and making EI a naturally occurring cys-serpin.

MAPPING

In the course of studying 4 closely linked genes encoding members of the
ovalbumin family of serine proteinase inhibitors (Ov-serpins) located on
18q21.3, Schneider et al. (1995) investigated the mapping of elastase
inhibitor. They prepared PCR primer sets of the gene, and by using the
NIGMS monochromosomal somatic cell hybrid panel, showed that the EI gene
maps to chromosome 6.

By amplifying DNA of a somatic cell hybrid panel, Evans et al. (1995)
unambiguously localized ELANH2 to chromosome 6. With the use of a panel
of radiation and somatic cell hybrids specific for chromosome 6, they
refined the localization to the short arm telomeric of D6S89, F13A
(134570), and D6S202 at 6pter-p24.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels couple cell metabolism to membrane
excitability in various cell types, including pancreatic beta cells,
neurons, endocrine cells, and muscle cells. The archetypal KATP channel
is an octameric complex of KCNJ11 subunits and either SUR1 (ABCC8;
600509) subunits in pancreatic beta cells and many neurons or SUR2
(ABCC9; 601439) subunits in muscle. Four KCNJ11 subunits form the
channel pore, and each is associated with a SUR subunit that contributes
to regulation of channel gating (summary by Girard et al., 2009).

CLONING

Inagaki et al. (1995) cloned a member of the inwardly rectifying
potassium channel family, which they called BIR, for 'beta-cell inward
rectifier,' or Kir6.2, in the nomenclature of Chandy and Gutman (1993).
The channel was expressed in large amounts in rat pancreatic islets and
glucose-responsive insulin-secreting cell lines. The sequence showed a
single open reading frame encoding a 390-amino acid protein with 2
putative transmembrane segments. The mouse homolog also had a single
open reading frame encoding a 390-amino acid protein with 96% amino acid
identity with human BIR.

GENE STRUCTURE

Inagaki et al. (1995) determined that KCNJ11, the gene encoding human
BIR, is intronless in the protein-coding region. Several other genes
encoding inward rectifiers lack introns.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Inagaki et al. (1995) mapped the
BIR gene to 11p15.1. The sequence obtained from 1 lambda clone at the
3-prime end of the SUR gene (ABCC8; 600509) matched a part of the gene
encoding BIR; with a sense primer near the 3-prime end of the SUR gene
and an antisense primer near the 5-prime end of the BIR gene they
PCR-amplified an approximately 4.5-kb fragment. Thus, the authors
determined that the 2 genes are clustered at 11p15.1, with the BIR gene
immediately 3-prime of the SUR gene. The SUR gene had previously been
mapped to 11p15.1 by fluorescence in situ hybridization (Thomas et al.,
1995).

GENE FUNCTION

In pancreatic beta cells, ATP-potassium channels are crucial for the
regulation of glucose-induced insulin secretion and are the target for
the sulfonylureas, oral hypoglycemic agents widely used in the treatment
of noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM; 125853), and for
diazoxide, a potassium channel opener. The sulfonylurea receptor (SUR)
is a member of the ATP-binding cassette superfamily with multiple
transmembrane-spanning domains and 2 potential nucleotide-binding folds.
Inagaki et al. (1995) demonstrated that coexpression of BIR with SUR
reconstituted an inwardly rectifying potassium conductance of 76
picosiemens that was sensitive to ATP and was inhibited by sulfonylureas
and activated by diazoxide. The data indicated to the authors that these
pancreatic beta-cell potassium channels are a complex composed of at
least 2 subunits: BIR and SUR.

Inagaki et al. (1996) cloned rat SUR2 (601439) and found that
coexpression of SUR2 and BIR in COS-1 cells reconstituted the properties
of K(ATP) channels described in cardiac and skeletal muscle. However,
they found that the SUR2/BIR channel is less sensitive than the SUR/BIR
channel both to ATP and to the sulfonylurea glibenclamide, and is
activated by the cardiac K(ATP) channel openers cromakalim and pinacidil
but not by diazoxide. The affinity of SUR2 for sulfonylureas is 500
times lower than that of SUR.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Hyperinsulinemic Hypoglycemia

Thomas et al. (1996) screened genomic DNA from members of 15 families
with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (HHF2; 601820) for mutations in the
KCNJ11 gene. In a male infant with profound hypoglycemia, born of
consanguineous Iranian parents, Thomas et al. (1996) identified
homozygosity for a 649T-C mutation (600937.0001). His parents were
heterozygous for the mutation.

Using SSCP and nucleotide sequence analysis, Nestorowicz et al. (1997)
screened 78 patients with hyperinsulinism for mutations in the KCNJ11
gene and identified homozygosity for a nonsense mutation (600937.0009)
in 1 patient.

De Lonlay et al. (1997) showed that in cases of the focal form, but not
those of the diffuse form, of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia there was
specific loss of maternal alleles of the imprinted chromosome region
11p15 in cells of the hyperplastic area of the pancreas but not in
normal pancreatic cells. This somatic event was consistent with a
proliferative monoclonal lesion. It involves disruption of the balance
between monoallelic expression of several maternally and paternally
expressed genes. Thus, they provided the first molecular explanation for
the heterogeneity of sporadic forms of PHHI such that it is possible to
perform only partial pancreatectomy, limited to the focal somatic
lesion, so as to avoid iatrogenic diabetes in patients with focal
adenomatous hyperplasia. It is possible that in these cases of somatic
loss of maternal 11p15.1, there is reduction to homozygosity for a
recessive ABCC8 or KCNJ11 mutation on the paternal allele, since both
ABCC8 and KCNJ11 are located in the 11p15.1 region.

Tornovsky et al. (2004) screened 15 patients with neonatal
hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia for mutations in the ABCC8 and KCNJ11
genes and identified 12 mutations in 11 patients. Homozygosity for a
mutation in the promoter (600937.0010) and in exon 1 (600937.0011) of
the KCNJ11 gene were identified in an Israeli Bedouin and an Arab
patient, respectively.

Henwood et al. (2005) measured acute insulin responses (AIRs) to
calcium, leucine, glucose, and tolbutamide in 22 infants with recessive
ABCC8 or KCNJ11 mutations (see, e.g., 600937.0019), 8 of whom had
diffuse hyperinsulinism and 14 of whom had focal hyperinsulinism. Of the
24 total mutations, 7 showed evidence of residual K(ATP) channel
function: 2 of the patients with partial defects were homozygous and 4
heterozygous for amino acid substitutions or insertions, and 1 was a
compound heterozygote for 2 premature stop codons.

Lin et al. (2008) investigated the mechanisms by which
hyperinsulinism-associated mutations of arg301 (R301) in KCNJ11 (e.g.,
R301H; 600937.0019) lead to channel dysfunction. They found that R301
mutations in rat Kcnj11 resulted in reduced channel expression at the
cell surface in transfected cells and caused rapid, spontaneous current
decay, or inactivation. Mutagenesis studies indicated that R301 is near
the Kcnj11 subunit-subunit interface and likely stabilizes channel
activity. To evaluate the effects of channel inactivation on beta cell
function, Lin et al. (2008) expressed an alternative R301 mutation,
R301A, which induces channel inactivation without affecting channel
surface expression, in a rat insulinoma cell line. Expression of Kcnj11
with R301A resulted in more depolarized membrane potential and elevated
insulin secretion at basal glucose concentration compared with cells
expressing wildtype channels. Lin et al. (2008) concluded that mutations
at R301 may cause channel inactivation by disrupting subunit-subunit
interactions, and that this gating defect is sufficient to cause loss of
channel function and hyperinsulinism.

Pinney et al. (2008) identified 14 different dominantly inherited K(ATP)
channel mutations in 16 unrelated families, 13 with mutations in the
ABCC8 gene (see, e.g., 600509.0011) and 3 with mutations in the KCNJ11
gene (see, e.g., 600937.0020). Unlike recessive mutations, dominantly
inherited K(ATP) mutant subunits trafficked normally to the plasma
membrane when expressed in simian kidney cells; dominant mutations also
resulted in different channel-gating defects, with dominant ABCC8
mutations diminishing channel responses to magnesium adenosine
diphosphate or diazoxide and dominant KCNJ11 mutations impairing channel
opening even in the absence of nucleotides. Pinney et al. (2008)
concluded that there are distinctive features of dominant K(ATP)
hyperinsulinism compared to the more common and more severe recessive
form, including retention of normal subunit trafficking, impaired
channel activity, and a milder hypoglycemia phenotype that may escape
detection in infancy and is often responsive to diazoxide medical
therapy.

Taneja et al. (2009) reported that the Kir6.2 channel contains a
diacidic ER exit signal DXE at codons 280 to 282, which promotes
concentration of the channel into COPII-enriched ER exit sites prior to
ER export via a process that requires Sar1-GTPase (607690). They
identified an E282K mutation (600937.0022) in a Swedish patient with
HHF2 with focal adenomatous hyperplasia. The E282K mutation abrogated
the ER exit signal and prevented ER export and surface expression of the
channel. When coexpressed, the E282K-mutant subunit was able to
associate with the wildtype Kir6.2 and form functional channels, and
unlike most mutations did not cause protein misfolding. Since in focal
congenital hyperinsulinism, the maternal chromosome containing the
K(ATP) channel genes is lost, beta-cells of the patient lacked wildtype
Kir6.2 to rescue the mutant Kir6.2 subunit expressed from the paternal
chromosome. The resultant absence of functional KATP channels leads to
insulin hypersecretion. Taneja et al. (2009) concluded that surface
expression of K(ATP) channels is critically dependent on the
Sar1-GTPase-dependent ER exit mechanism, and abrogation of the diacidic
ER exit signal leads to congenital hyperinsulinism.

- Diabetes Mellitus Type II

Hani et al. (1998) identified an association between an E23K variant in
the KCNJ11 gene (600937.0014) and type II diabetes mellitus (125853) in
French families.

Hansen et al. (2005) studied the effects of the E23K polymorphism and a
PPARG P12A polymorphism (601487.0002) on the risk of type II diabetes
and found that the polymorphisms may act in an additive manner to
increase the risk of type II diabetes.

- Permanent Neonatal Diabetes

Because ATP-sensitive potassium channels mediate glucose-stimulated
insulin secretion from the pancreatic beta cells, Gloyn et al. (2004)
hypothesized that activating mutations in the KCNJ11 gene might cause
neonatal diabetes. They studied 29 patients with permanent neonatal
diabetes (PNDM; 606176) characterized by ketoacidosis or marked
hyperglycemia who were treated with insulin. The patients did not
secrete insulin in response to glucose or glucagon but did secrete
insulin in response to tolbutamide. Four of the patients also had severe
developmental delay and muscle weakness; 3 of them also had epilepsy and
mild dysmorphic features (DEND; see 606176). Gloyn et al. (2004)
sequenced the KCNJ11 gene in all 29 patients and identified 6 novel,
heterozygous missense mutations in 10. In 4 of the 10 families, the
mutation was an arg201-to-his (R201H) substitution (600937.0002). In 2
patients, the diabetes was familial. In 8 patients, the diabetes arose
from a spontaneous mutation (see, e.g., V59M; 600937.0003). When the
most common mutation, R201H, was coexpressed with SUR in Xenopus
oocytes, the ability of ATP to block mutant ATP-sensitive potassium
channels was greatly reduced. Thus, whereas inactivating mutations of
KCNJ11 lead to uncontrolled insulin secretion and congenital
hyperinsulinism, activating mutations cause neonatal diabetes. Gloyn et
al. (2004) concluded that heterozygous activating mutations of the
KCNJ11 gene are a common cause (approximately 34%) of permanent neonatal
diabetes. In a high proportion (80%) of subjects studied in their
series, the mutation occurred de novo.

Gloyn et al. (2005) identified 3 novel heterozygous mutations (see,
e.g., 600937.0017-600937.0018) in 3 of 11 probands with clinically
defined TNDM who did not have chromosome 6q24 abnormalities. The
mutations cosegregated with diabetes in 2 families and were not found in
100 controls. All 3 probands had insulin-treated diabetes diagnosed in
the first 4 months of life and went into remission by 7 to 17 months of
age. In transformed Xenopus oocytes, all 3 heterozygous mutations
resulted in a reduction in sensitivity to ATP when compared with
wildtype; however, the effect was less than that of PNDM-associated
mutations. Gloyn et al. (2005) concluded that mutations in KCNJ11 can
cause both remitting and permanent diabetes, suggesting that a fixed ion
channel abnormality may result in a fluctuating glycemic phenotype.

Yorifuji et al. (2005) found a missense mutation in the KCNJ11 gene
(600937.0012) in a 4-generation family with dominantly inherited
diabetes mellitus observed in 3 generations (see 610582). The onset and
severity of the diabetes were variable: transient neonatal diabetes,
childhood-onset diabetes, gestational diabetes, or adult-onset diabetes.

In a 20-year-old woman who had transient neonatal diabetes mellitus that
recurred at age 7 years, Colombo et al. (2005) identified heterozygosity
for a de novo R201H mutation in the KCNJ11 gene.

Proks et al. (2005) studied the MgATP sensitivity of KCNJ11-mutant
K(ATP) channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. In contrast to wildtype
channels, Mg(2+) dramatically reduced the ATP sensitivity of
heterozygous R201C (600937.0004), R201H, V59M, and V59G (600937.0005)
channels. This effect was predominantly mediated via the
nucleotide-binding domains of SUR1 (ABCC8; 600509) and resulted from an
enhanced stimulatory action of MgATP. Proks et al. (2005) concluded that
KCNJ11 mutations increase the current magnitude of heterozygous K(ATP)
channels by increasing MgATP activation and by decreasing ATP
inhibition. The fraction of unblocked K(ATP) current at physiologic
MgATP concentrations correlated with the severity of the clinical
phenotype.

- Association with Impaired Exercise Stress Response

Reyes et al. (2009) found that the E23K polymorphism was overrepresented
in individuals with dilated cardiomyopathy (see 115200) and congestive
heart failure (CHF) compared to controls, and that the KK genotype was
associated with abnormal cardiopulmonary exercise stress testing. Reyes
et al. (2009) suggested that E23K might represent a biomarker for
impaired stress performance.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

To determine why some mutations in the KCNJ11 gene cause PNDM in
isolation whereas others cause PNDM associated with marked developmental
delay, muscle weakness, and epilepsy, Proks et al. (2004) expressed
wildtype or mutant Kir6.2/sulfonylurea receptor-1 channels in Xenopus
oocytes. All of the mutations investigated (R201C, Q52R, and V59G)
increased resting whole-cell K(ATP) currents by reducing channel
inhibition by ATP, but in the simulated heterozygous state, the mutation
causing PNDM alone (R201C) produced smaller K(ATP) currents and less
change in ATP sensitivity than mutations associated with severe disease
(Q52R and V59G). These findings suggested that increased K(ATP) currents
hyperpolarize pancreatic beta cells and impair insulin secretion,
whereas larger K(ATP) currents are required to influence extra
pancreatic cell function. Proks et al. (2004) also found that mutations
causing PNDM alone impaired ATP sensitivity directly (at the binding
site), whereas those associated with severe disease acted indirectly by
biasing the channel conformation toward the open state. The effect of
the mutation on ATP sensitivity in the heterozygous state reflected the
different contributions of a single subunit in the Kir6.2 tetramer to
ATP inhibition and to the energy of the open state. The results showed
that mutations in the slide helix of Kir6.2 (V59G) influence the channel
kinetics, providing evidence that this domain is involved in Kir channel
gating and suggesting that the efficacy of sulfonylurea therapy in PNDM
may vary with genotype.

Massa et al. (2005) screened the KCNJ11 gene in 18 Italian patients with
what they termed 'permanent diabetes mellitus of infancy' (PDMI),
including 12 patients with onset within 3 months after birth and 6 with
onset between 3 months to 1 year of age. Five different heterozygous
mutations were identified in 8 patients with diabetes diagnosed between
day 3 and day 182. Two of these mutations were novel. Four of the 8
patients also had motor and/or developmental delay. Massa et al. (2005)
concluded that KCNJ11 mutations are a common cause of PNDM either in
isolation or associated with developmental delay.

The beta-cell ATP-sensitive potassium channel is a key component of
stimulus-secretion coupling in the pancreatic beta cell. The channel
couples metabolism to membrane electrical events, bringing about insulin
secretion. Given the critical role of this channel in glucose
homeostasis, it is not surprising that mutations in the genes encoding
the 2 essential subunits of the channel, KCNJ11 and ABCC8, can result in
either hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. Gloyn et al. (2006) reviewed the
loss-of-function mutations in KCNJ11 and ABCC8, which can cause
oversecretion of insulin and result in hyperinsulinemia of infancy. They
reviewed the management of patients in whom mutations in these genes are
found.

From a study of 49 patients with activating Kir6.2 mutations,
Slingerland and Hattersley (2006) concluded that these mutations cause a
severe reduction in fetal insulin secretion and hence fetal growth but
that this is independent of mutation severity. Postnatal catch-up
required insulin treatment but was complete, except in those with
epilepsy.

ANIMAL MODEL

Miki et al. (1997) generated transgenic mice expressing a
dominant-negative mutation within the conserved gly-tyr-gly motif of the
putative K(+)-permeable domain of Kcnj11. The gene was inserted
downstream of the human insulin promoter region for selective expression
in pancreatic beta cells. Transgenic mice developed hypoglycemia with
hyperinsulinemia as neonates and hyperglycemia with hypoinsulinemia and
decreased beta cell numbers as adults. Kcnj11 function was impaired in
the beta cells of transgenic mice with hyperglycemia, and both resting
membrane potential and basal calcium concentrations were significantly
elevated in transgenic mice. Miki et al. (1997) also observed a high
frequency of apoptotic beta cells prior to the development of
hyperglycemia, suggesting a role for Kcnj11 in cell survival as well as
in regulating insulin secretion.

Koster et al. (2000) generated transgenic mice expressing pancreatic
beta-cell K(ATP) channels with reduced ATP sensitivity. They used
transgenes with truncation of the N-terminal 30 amino acids of the
Kir6.2 subunit, and a double mutant with the 30-amino acid truncation
and a lys185-to-gln mutation. These transgenes were fused at the C
terminus with the green fluorescent protein to allow for detection under
ultraviolet illumination. Transgenic animals developed severe
hyperglycemia, hypoinsulinemia, and ketoacidosis within 2 days, and
typically died within 5 days. Nevertheless, islet morphology, insulin
localization, and alpha- and beta-cell distributions were normal (before
day 3), pointing to reduced insulin secretion as causal. The data
indicated that normal K(ATP) channel activity is critical for
maintenance of euglycemia and that overactivity can cause diabetes by
inhibiting insulin secretion.

In mice with a conditional deletion of Hnf4a (600281) in pancreatic beta
cells, Gupta et al. (2005) observed hyperinsulinemia in fasted and fed
animals but also impaired glucose tolerance. Islet perfusion and
calcium-imaging studies showed abnormal beta cell responses to
stimulation by glucose and sulfonylureas, explainable in part by a 60%
reduction in expression of the potassium channel subunit Kir6.2.
Cotransfection assays revealed that the Kir6.2 gene is a transcriptional
target of HNF4A. Gupta et al. (2005) concluded that HNF4A is required in
the pancreatic beta cell for regulation of the pathway of insulin
secretion dependent on the ATP-dependent potassium channel.

ATP-sensitive potassium channels are activated by various metabolic
stresses, including hypoxia. The substantia nigra pars reticulata, the
area with the highest expression of ATP-sensitive potassium channels in
the brain, plays a pivotal role in the control of seizures. Yamada et
al. (2001) studied mutant mice lacking the Kir6.2 subunit of
ATP-sensitive potassium channels and found that they were susceptible to
generalized seizures after brief hypoxia. In normal mice, the substantia
nigra pars reticulata neuron activity was inactivated during hypoxia by
the opening of the postsynaptic ATP-sensitive potassium channels,
whereas in knockout mice, the activity of these neurons was enhanced.
ATP-sensitive potassium channels exert a depressant effect on substantia
nigra pars reticulata neuronal activity during hypoxia and may be
involved in the nigral protection mechanism against generalized
seizures.

Girard et al. (2009) created a mouse strain conditionally expressing the
human Kir6.2 V59M mutation (600937.0003) specifically in pancreatic beta
cells. Kir6.2(V59M) mRNA was expressed at a level comparable to that of
endogenous wildtype Kir6.2 mRNA. Mutant mice (beta-V59M mice) developed
severe diabetes soon after birth, and by 5 weeks of age, blood glucose
levels were markedly increased and insulin was undetectable. Isolated
beta-V59M islets displayed a reduced percentage of beta cells, abnormal
morphology, abnormal calcium oscillations, lower insulin content, and
decreased expression of Kir6.2, Sur1, and insulin mRNA. Beta-V59M islets
secreted substantially less insulin and showed a smaller increase in
intracellular calcium in response to glucose than wildtype islets, which
was due to reduced sensitivity of Kir6.2(V69M) channels to ATP or
glucose. Current and secretion events downstream of channel closure
remained intact.

By using mice carrying the human V59M mutation in Kir6.2 (600937.0003)
targeted to either muscle or nerve, Clark et al. (2010) showed that
analogous motor impairments originate in the central nervous system
rather than in muscle or peripheral nerves. Clark et al. (2010) also
identified locomotor hyperactivity as a feature of K(ATP) channel
overactivity. Clark et al. (2010) concluded that their finding suggested
that drugs targeted against neuronal, rather than muscle, K(ATP)
channels are needed to treat the motor deficits and that such drugs
require high blood-brain barrier permeability.

In a male infant with profound hypoglycemia (601820), born of

homozygosity for a 649T-C mutation in the KCNJ11 gene, resulting in a

KCNJ11, ARG201HIS

In 4 unrelated patients with permanent neonatal diabetes (606176), Gloyn
et al. (2004) identified a heterozygous arg201-to-his (R201H) mutation
in the KCNJ11 gene. The arg201 residue lies close to the ATP-binding
site and was implicated in ATP sensitivity (Ribalet et al., 2003). In 1
family reported by Gloyn et al. (2004), 2 brothers and the father were
affected. Diabetes in the brothers was diagnosed under the age of 3 or 4
weeks, and in the father at the age of 12 weeks. The father was age 46
years at the time of report. In another family, mother and son were
affected. The diagnosis had been made at birth in the son and at age 6
weeks in the mother, who was 36 years old at the time of report. None of
the patients with the R201H mutation had muscle weakness, neurologic
abnormalities, or dysmorphic features. The arginine residue at position
201 of Kir6.2 lies close to the ATP-binding site and was previously
implicated in ATP sensing.

By functional expression studies in Xenopus oocytes, Proks et al. (2004)
found that mutations at the arg201 residue (see also R201C; 600937.0004)
caused a decrease in ATP sensitivity by altering the ATP-binding site.
However, the decreased sensitivity found in cells with a mutation at
arg201 was not as severe as that found in cells with a mutation at val59
(see V59M, 600937.0003 and V59G, 600937.0005).

Gloyn et al. (2006) reported 2 unrelated infants with PNDM and the R201H
mutation. The male infant also had dysmorphic facial features and
neurologic involvement, including seizures, developmental delay, and
axial hypotonia. In contrast, the other infant did not have neurologic
involvement, and her mother, who also carried the mutation, had severe
diabetes mellitus without neurologic involvement. The phenotypic
variability suggested that other modifying factors likely play a role.

In a 20-year-old woman with transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM3;
610582) in whom diabetes remitted at age 29 months and recurred at age 7
years, Colombo et al. (2005) identified heterozygosity for a de novo
602G-A (R201H) mutation in the KCNJ11 gene.

KCNJ11, VAL59MET

In 2 unrelated males with permanent neonatal diabetes (606176), Gloyn et
al. (2004) found heterozygosity for a val59-to-met (V59M) mutation in
the KCNJ11 gene. One of the patients had muscle weakness, and mildly
delayed motor and mental development.

Proks et al. (2004) noted that 2 mutations in the same residue of
Kir6.2, V59M and V59G (600937.0005), are associated with a more severe
form of PNDM that may be accompanied by developmental delay, muscle
weakness, and epilepsy, compared to PNDM caused by the mutations R201H
(600937.0002) and R201C (600937.0004). They found that residue val59
lies some distance from the ATP-binding site, within the N-terminal
region of the protein; moreover, val59 lies within the 'slide helix,' a
domain postulated to be involved in the opening and closing (gating) of
Kir channels. Functional expression studies in Xenopus oocytes indicated
that the V59M and V59G mutations decreased ATP sensitivity indirectly by
favoring the open conformation of the channel.

Massa et al. (2005) found the V59M mutation in 4 unrelated Italian
patients with PNDM. Two of the patients had motor and mental
developmental delay. One of the patients was diagnosed at over 6 months
of age (182 days). Massa et al. (2005) suggested that the designation
'permanent diabetes mellitus of infancy' (PDMI) replace 'permanent
neonatal diabetes mellitus.'

Gloyn et al. (2006) reported a patient with the V59M mutation who had
PNDM and neurologic features, including mild motor developmental delay
and axial hypotonia.

KCNJ11, ARG201CYS

In a patient with PNDM (606176), Gloyn et al. (2004) identified a
heterozygous arg201-to-cys (R201C) mutation in the Kir6.2 gene. The
patient was diagnosed at 4 weeks of age and had no additional neurologic
or dysmorphic features. The arg201 residue lies close to the ATP-binding
site and was implicated in ATP sensitivity (Ribalet et al., 2003).

Proks et al. (2004) stated that the 2 mutations in residue arg201, R201H
(600937.0002) and R201C, which lie in the ATP-binding site of Kir6.2,
cause milder PNDM disease without neurologic features; however, Massa et
al. (2005) identified the R201C mutation in a patient with PNDM who also
had muscle weakness and delayed motor development.

Gloyn et al. (2004) described a family in which 2 affected paternal
half-sibs were heterozygous for the R201C mutation. Direct sequencing of
leukocyte DNA showed that their clinically unaffected mothers and father
were genotypically normal. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of the
father's leukocyte DNA detected no trace of mutant DNA. These results
were consistent with the father being mosaic for the mutation, which was
restricted to his germline. Gloyn et al. (2004) concluded that the high
percentage of permanent neonatal diabetes cases due to de novo KCNJ11
mutations (Gloyn et al., 2004) suggests that germline mosaicism may be
common.

DIABETES MELLITUS, PERMANENT NEONATAL, WITH NEUROLOGIC FEATURES
KCNJ11, VAL59GLY

In a male patient with permanent neonatal diabetes (606176), Gloyn et
al. (2004) found heterozygosity for a val59-to-gly (V59G) mutation in
the KCNJ11 gene. In addition to neonatal diabetes, the patient had
muscle weakness, marked motor and mental developmental delay, myoclonic
seizures with abnormal EEG, and dysmorphic features, including a
downturned mouth, bilateral ptosis, and contractures primarily in the
legs at birth.

Proks et al. (2004) noted that 2 mutations in the same residue of
Kir6.2, V59M (600937.0003) and V59G, are associated with a more severe
form of PNDM that may be accompanied by developmental delay, muscle
weakness, and epilepsy, compared to PNDM caused by the mutations R201H
(600937.0002) and R201C (600937.0004). Proks et al. (2004) found that
residue val59 lies some distance from the ATP-binding site, within the
N-terminal region of the protein; moreover, val59 lies within the 'slide
helix,' a domain postulated to be involved in the opening and closing
(gating) of Kir channels. Functional expression studies in Xenopus
oocytes indicated that the V59M and V59G mutations decreased ATP
sensitivity indirectly by favoring the open conformation of the channel.

HYPERINSULINEMIC HYPOGLYCEMIA, FAMILIAL, 2
KCNJ11, TYR12TER

In a Palestinian Arab boy with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (601820),
born of first-cousin parents, Nestorowicz et al. (1997) identified
homozygosity for a 39C-A transversion in the KCNJ11 gene, resulting in a
tyr12-to-ter (Y12X) substitution. The mutation is predicted to produce a
truncated Kir6.2 polypeptide lacking the putative K+ ion-selective pore
region as well as those domains proposed to confer the gating and inward
rectification properties of the molecule. In vitro studies in
transfected COS-1 cells confirmed the deleterious effect of the mutation
on channel activity. The authors noted that this patient was clinically
indistinguishable from patients with severe hyperinsulinism caused by
mutations in SUR1 (ABCC8; 600509; see HHF1, 600509).

In an Israeli Bedouin infant with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia

transversion 5-prime of the transcription start site in the promoter
region of the KCNJ11 gene. Functional studies using a luciferase
reporter vector revealed a 44% decrease in reporter gene expression for
the mutant variant compared to wildtype.

In an Arab infant in whom a prenatal diagnosis of hyperinsulinism was

Tornovsky et al. (2004) identified homozygosity for a C-T transition at
codon 254 in exon 1 of the KCNJ11 gene, resulting in a pro254-to-leu
(P254L) substitution. Photolabeling studies after transient transfection
into COSm6 cells revealed impaired trafficking of the mutant channel.

KCNJ11, CYS42ARG

In affected members of a 4-generation Japanese family with dominantly
inherited diabetes mellitus observed in 3 generations, Yorifuji et al.
(2005) detected a T-to-C transition at nucleotide 124 of the KCNJ11 gene
that gave rise to a cys42-to-arg amino acid substitution (C24R). The
proband had transient neonatal diabetes (TNDM3; 610582), and his
paternal grandfather had childhood diabetes. The others had adult-onset
diabetes without autoantibodies or insulin resistance. Patch-clamp
experiments using the mutated KCNJ11 showed that the mutation causes
increased spontaneous open probability and reduced ATP sensitivity. The
effect, however, was partially compensated by the reduction of
functional ATP-sensitive potassium channel expression at the cell
surface, which could account for the milder phenotype of the patients.
The authors concluded that these results broadened the spectrum of
diabetes phenotypes caused by mutations of KCNJ11 and suggested that
mutations in this gene should be taken into consideration for not only
permanent neonatal diabetes but also other forms of diabetes with milder
phenotypes and later onset.

HYPERINSULINEMIC HYPOGLYCEMIA, FAMILIAL, 2
KCNJ11, HIS259ARG

In a patient with severe congenital hyperinsulinism (601820), Marthinet
et al. (2005) identified a homozygous A-to-G transition at nucleotide
776 of the KCNJ11 gene that resulted in a his-259-to-arg substitution
(H259R). The patient presented with macrosomia at birth and severe
hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. Despite medical treatment, the newborn
continued to suffer from severe hypoglycemic episodes, and at 4 months
of age subtotal pancreatectomy was performed. Coexpression of KCNJ11
H259R with ABCC8 (600509) in HEK293T cells completely abolished K(ATP)
currents in electrophysiologic recordings. Double immunofluorescence
staining revealed that mutant KCNJ11 was partly retained in the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) causing decreased surface expression as
observed with total internal reflection fluorescence. Mutation of an
ER-retention signal partially rescued the trafficking defect without
restoring whole-cell currents.

KCNJ11, GLU23LYS

Hani et al. (1998) identified a glu23-to-lys (E23K) amino acid
substitution in the KCNJ11 gene by molecular screening using SSCP and
direct sequencing in 72 French Caucasian type II diabetic families. They
genotyped this variant in French cohorts of 191 unrelated type II
diabetic probands and 119 normoglycemic control subjects and performed
association studies. Homozygosity for lys23 (KK) was more frequent in
type II diabetic than in control subjects (27 vs 14%; p = 0.015).
Analyses in a recessive model (KK vs EK/EE) showed a stronger
association of the K allele with diabetes. In a metaanalysis of their
data for the E23K variant and data obtained from 3 other Caucasian
groups, Hani et al. (1998) found the E23K variant to be significantly
associated with type II diabetes.

Hansen et al. (2005) investigated the separate and combined effects of
the PPARG pro12-to-ala (P12A; 601487.0002) and the KCNJ11 E23K
polymorphisms on risk of type II diabetes. The combined analysis
involved 1,164 type II diabetic patients and 4,733 middle-aged,
glucose-tolerant subjects. In the separate analyses, the K allele of
KCNJ11 E23K associated with type II diabetes (odds ratio, 1.19; P =
0.0002), whereas PPARG P12A showed no significant association with type
2 diabetes. The combined analysis indicated that the 2 polymorphisms
acted in an additive manner to increase the risk of type II diabetes,
and the authors found no evidence for a synergistic interaction between
them. Together, the 2 polymorphisms conferred a population-attributable
risk for type II diabetes of 28%. The authors concluded that their
results showed no evidence of a synergistic interaction between the
KCNJ11 E23K and PPARG P12A polymorphisms, but indicated that they may
act in an additive manner to increase the risk of type II diabetes.

Laukkanen et al. (2004) found an additive effect of a high risk ABCC8
(600509) haplotype, composed of a silent polymorphism (AGG-AGA; arg1273
to arg) and 3 promoter polymorphisms, and the 23K allele of the KCNJ11
gene.

In genomewide association studies of type 2 diabetes involving genotype
data from a variety of international consortia, the Diabetes Genetics
Initiative of Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Lund University, and
Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (2007), Zeggini et al.
(2007), and Scott et al. (2007) confirmed association of the E23K
polymorphism (dbSNP rs5219) with diabetes susceptibility. Although this
association was not strongly observed in any single scan, all-data
metaanalyses resulted in genomewide significant association (OR = 1.14,
P = 6.7 x 10(-11)).

Association with Impaired Exercise Stress Response

Reyes et al. (2009) found that the E23K polymorphism was overrepresented
in 115 individuals with dilated cardiomyopathy (see 115200) and
congestive heart failure (CHF) compared to 2,031 community-based
controls (p less than 0.001). In addition, the KK genotype, which was
present in 18% of the CHF patients, was associated with abnormal
cardiopulmonary exercise stress testing: despite similar baseline heart
rates among genotype subgroups, individuals with the KK genotype had a
significantly reduced heart rate increase at matched workload, at 75% of
maximum oxygen consumption, and at peak VO(2), compared to those with
the EE or EK genotypes. Noting that the glu23 residue is located within
the functionally relevant intracellular slide helix region, Reyes et al.
(2009) suggested that E23K might represent a biomarker for impaired
stress performance.

In an infant with a severe form of permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus

heterozygous G-to-T transversion in the KCNJ11 gene, resulting in a
cys166-to-phe (C166F) substitution. The infant had feeding problem from
birth and was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus at age 3 months. She also
had seizures with hypsarrhythmia, progressive neurologic deterioration,
diffuse hypotonia, and dysmorphic facial features. She died from
aspiration pneumonia at age 6 months. Gloyn et al. (2006) noted that the
C166F mutation is predicted to result in a channel with a marked
increase in open probability and reduced sensitivity to ATP, which would
severely alter the function of the channel in brain, muscle, and nerves,
in addition to pancreatic beta cells.

In an Italian boy with a severe form of permanent neonatal diabetes with

heterozygous de novo 499A-C transversion in the KCNJ11 gene, resulting
in an ile167-to-leu (I167L) substitution at the cytoplasmic end of the
second transmembrane domain near the internal gate of the channel. In
vitro functional expression studies showed that the mutant I167L channel
had severely impaired sensitivity to ATP and markedly increased open
channel probability. Sulfonylurea treatment resulted in partial blockade
of current in the mutant channels, and the patient showed a good
response to sulfonylurea treatment, with both improved glycemic control
and neurologic improvement.

In a sister and brother with TNDM3 (610582), Gloyn et al. (2005)
identified a heterozygous G-to-A transition in the KCNJ11 gene,
resulting in a gly53-to-ser (G53S) substitution. The mutation was not
identified in 100 control individuals. Both children had insulin-treated
diabetes diagnosed in the first 3 weeks of life and went into remission
by age 20 months. The affected mother was positive for the mutation but
had a milder phenotype, having been diagnosed at age 4 years and
requiring only a low dose of insulin for glycemic control. In
transformed Xenopus oocytes, the G53S mutation resulted in a reduction
in sensitivity to ATP when compared with wildtype; however, the effect
was less than that of PNDM-associated mutations.

at age 16 weeks and went into remission by 17 months with relapse at age
28 months. The affected mother was positive for the mutation and was
diagnosed with diabetes at 11 weeks with no periods of remission. Both
mother and son had learning difficulties. In transformed Xenopus
oocytes, the G53R mutation resulted in a reduction in sensitivity to ATP

Koster et al. (2008) reported a 27-year-old patient with intermediate
developmental delay, epilepsy, and neonatal diabetes (606176) in whom
sequencing revealed a heterozygous gly53-to-asp (G53D) mutation in the
KCNJ11 gene. Treatment was progressively transferred from insulin to the
inhibitory sulfonylureas (SUs) gliclazide and finally to glibenclamide.
The patient demonstrated improved glycemic control and motor
coordination with SU treatment, with glibenclamide more effective than
gliclazide. Reconstituted G53D channels exhibited reduced ATP
sensitivity, which was predicted to suppress electrical activity in
vivo. G53D channels coexpressed with the pancreatic and neuronal isoform
of the sulfonylurea receptor SUR1 (600509) exhibited high-affinity block
by gliclazide but were insensitive to block when coexpressed with the
skeletal muscle isoform SUR2A (601439). Koster et al. (2008) concluded
that SUs can resolve motor dysfunction in an adult with intermediate
DEND and that this improvement is due to inhibition of the neuronal but
not skeletal muscle ATP-sensitive potassium channel.

HYPERINSULINEMIC HYPOGLYCEMIA, FAMILIAL, 2
KCNJ11, GLU282LYS

In a Swedish patient with HHF2 (601820) with focal adenomatous

KCNJ11 gene, resulting in a glu282-to-lys (E282K) substitution within a
diacidic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit signal DXE at codons 280 to
282. The paternal E282K mutation abrogated the exit signal and prevented
the ER export and surface expression of the channel. Since in focal
hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, the maternal chromosome containing the
K(ATP) channel genes are lost, beta-cells of the patient would lack
wildtype Kir6.2 to rescue the mutant Kir6.2 subunit expressed from the
paternal chromosome.

KCNJ11, PHE60TYR

In a patient with neonatal diabetes, developmental delay, and epilepsy
(606176), Mannikko et al. (2010) identified heterozygosity for 2 novel
mutations on the same haplotype (cis), phe60 to tyr (F60Y) and val64 to
leu (V64L), in the slide helix of Kir6.2 (KCNJ11). Functional analysis
revealed that the F60Y mutation increased the intrinsic channel open
probability, thereby indirectly producing a marked decrease in channel
inhibition by ATP and an increase in whole-cell potassium-ATP currents.
When expressed alone, the V64L mutation caused a small reduction in
apparent ATP inhibition, by enhancing the ability of MgATP to stimulate
channel activity. The V64L mutation also ameliorated the deleterious
effects on the F60Y mutation when it was expressed on the same, but not
a different, subunit. The authors concluded that F60Y is the pathogenic
mutation and that interactions between slide helix residues may
influence KATP channel gating.

610222	TITLE *610222 RAS AND RAB INTERACTOR 2; RIN2
;;RAB5-INTERACTING PROTEIN 2;;
RAS INHIBITOR JC265
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

RIN2 is a member of the RIN family of Ras interaction-interference
proteins, which are binding partners to the RAB5 small GTPases (see
RAB5A, 179512) (Saito et al., 2002).

CLONING

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis with GTPase-deficient mutant RAB5B
(179514) as bait, followed by database analysis and 5-prime RACE of a
human brain cDNA library, Saito et al. (2002) cloned the RIN2 gene. The
deduced 895-amino acid protein contains an SH2 domain, 2 proline-rich
domains, a RIN homology (RH) domain, a Vps9 domain, and a Ras
association domain, and has a molecular mass of 116 kD. Northern blot
analysis detected a 5.1-kb transcript in most tissues examined, with
highest expression in heart and kidney, and lowest expression in spleen
and peripheral blood cells. RIN2 mRNA expression was detected in HeLa
and astrocytoma cell lines, but not in the Jurkat or THP1 leukemic cell
lines. Using gel filtration analysis and coimmunoprecipitation of
Myc-tagged RIN2 deletion mutants, Saito et al. (2002) showed that RIN2
self-interacts as a homophilic tetramer that is formed by antiparallel
linkage of 2 parallel dimers.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Saito et al. (2002) showed that RIN2
interacted with both wildtype RAB5B and a constitutively active form of
RAB5B, but displayed weak interaction with a dominant-negative form of
RAB5B. RIN2 did not interact with wildtype HRAS (190020) or with an
active form of HRAS. RIN2 amino acids 497-784, which contain the RH and
Vps9 domains, were required for RAB5B binding. By in vitro binding
analysis of purified recombinant FLAG-tagged RIN2 and prenylated Rab5b,
Saito et al. (2002) demonstrated that RIN2 bound GTP preferentially over
GDP and accelerated GDP-GTP exchange on RAB5B. RIN2-GTP binding was slow
at physiologic concentrations of Mg(2+), and RIN2 enhancement of GDP-GTP
exchange achieved maximal levels during the first 5 minutes. Saito et
al. (2002) concluded that RIN2 acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange
factor.

Basel-Vanagaite et al. (2009) downregulated the expression of RIN2 in
normal fibroblasts by siRNA and observed the appearance of numerous
Golgi-associated vacuoles in RIN2-deficient fibroblasts. They also
showed that RIN2 deficiency was associated with paucity of dermal
microfibrils and deficiency of fibulin-5.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the RIN2
gene to chromosome 20 (TMAP RH68568).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 affected members of 2 related consanguineous Israeli-Arab families
with MACS syndrome (613075), Basel-Vanagaite et al. (2009) identified
homozygosity for a mutation in the RIN2 gene (610222.0001). RIN2 protein
was absent from fibroblasts from the patients, indicating a
loss-of-function effect.

In 3 Algerian sibs from a consanguineous family with MACS syndrome,
previously described by Verloes et al. (2005), Syx et al. (2010)
identified a homozygous 2-bp deletion in the RIN2 gene (610222.0002).
Ultrastructural studies of the skin revealed important abnormalities in
the collagen fibril morphology, and fibroblasts exhibited a dilated
endoplasmic reticulum and an abnormal Golgi apparatus with rarefied and
dilated cisternae.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MACROCEPHALY, ALOPECIA, CUTIS LAXA, AND SCOLIOSIS
RIN2, 1-BP DEL, 1731C

In 3 affected members of 2 related consanguineous Israeli-Arab families
with MACS syndrome (613075), Basel-Vanagaite et al. (2009) identified
homozygosity for a 1-bp deletion (1731delC) in the RIN2 gene, resulting
in a frameshift (Ile578SerfsX4). The mutation resulted in markedly
decreased RIN2 mRNA levels in RNA derived from patient skin biopsies,
suggesting that the mutation induces nonsense-mRNA decay. Immunoblotting
of protein extracts from patient-derived fibroblasts revealed absence of
the RIN2 protein. These data suggested that the mutation results in loss
of function of RIN2. The mutation was not found in 182 ethnically
matched control individuals.

.0002
MACROCEPHALY, ALOPECIA, CUTIS LAXA, AND SCOLIOSIS
RIN2, 2-BP DEL, 1914GC

In 3 affected Algerian sibs from a consanguineous family segregating an
autosomal recessive genodermatosis (613075), Syx et al. (2010)
identified a homozygous 2-bp deletion in exon 8 of the RIN2 gene
(1914_1915delGC). The variant introduces a frameshift and creates a
premature termination codon, leading to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.
The mutation was not found in 94 control individuals. The sibs, who were
originally described by Verloes et al. (2005), had progressive facial
coarsening, gingival hypertrophy, severe scoliosis, sparse hair, and
skin and joint hyperlaxity.

611602	TITLE *611602 RIMS-BINDING PROTEIN 2; RIMBP2
;;KIAA0318
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a human brain cDNA library, Nagase et
al. (1997) cloned RIMBP2, which they designated KIAA0318. The deduced
protein contains 1,106 amino acids. RT-PCR detected highest expression
in testis, followed by brain, placenta, ovary, small intestine, and
kidney, in order of decreasing expression. Other tissues showed little
to no expression.

Mittelstaedt and Schoch (2007) stated that, like other RIMBP proteins,
the deduced 1,076-amino acid RIMBP2 protein has a unique N-terminal
domain, followed by an SRC (190090) homology-3 (SH3) domain, 3 tandem
fibronectin (135600)-like 3 (FN3) domains, and 2 C-terminal SH3 domains.
It also has a proline-rich sequence in the linker region between the FN3
domains and the C-terminal SH3 domains. By EST database analysis,
Mittelstaedt and Schoch (2007) identified 3 conserved variants of mouse
and human RIMBP2 with alternative splicing affecting the N-terminal
region, the linker region, and the C-terminal sequence. In situ
hybridization of adult rat brain showed that Rimbp2 was expressed in
neurons in a region-specific manner.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a rat brain cDNA library, Wang et al.
(2000) found that the C-terminal halves of rat Rim1 (RIMS1; 606629) and
Rim2 (RIMS2; 606630) interacted with Rimbp1 (BZRAP1; 610764) and Rimbp2.

GENE STRUCTURE

Mittelstaedt and Schoch (2007) determined that the RIMBP2 gene contains
23 exons and spans 316.6 kb.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1997) mapped the RIMBP2
gene to chromosome 12. By genomic sequence analysis, Mittelstaedt and
Schoch (2007) mapped the RIMBP2 gene to chromosome 12q24.33. They mapped
the mouse Rimbp2 gene to chromosome 5F.

603953	TITLE *603953 POTASSIUM INWARDLY-RECTIFYING CHANNEL, SUBFAMILY J, MEMBER 14; KCNJ14
;;KIR2.4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Members of the inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channel family are
characterized by a channel structure with 2 transmembrane segments
surrounding putative pore loop. The Kir2 subfamily contains channels
characterized by their strong current rectification. By screening a rat
brain library with a bovine PCR fragment based on a human Kir-like EST
(GenBank GENBANK W25800), Topert et al. (1998) isolated a cDNA encoding
Kir2.4, a Kir2 subfamily member. In situ hybridization revealed that
Kir2.4 is expressed predominantly in motoneurons of cranial nerve motor
nuclei within the general somatic and special visceral motor cell
column. The unique Kir2.4 expression pattern and in situ measurements of
the functional characteristics of Kir2.4 in rat brainstem led the
authors to conclude that these channels serve an important function in
controlling the excitability of brainstem motoneurons. Northern blot
analysis revealed that Kir2.4 is expressed specifically in human brain.

608487	TITLE *608487 TRIPARTITE MOTIF-CONTAINING PROTEIN 5; TRIM5
;;RNF88
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TRIM5 belongs to the large tripartite motif protein family, members of
which typically are composed of 3 zinc-binding domains, a RING, unique
B-box type 1 and B-box type 2 domains, followed by a coiled-coil (CC)
region. TRIM proteins use homomultimerization to identify specific cell
compartments.

CLONING

Using a consensus B-box domain to screen dbEST databases, Reymond et al.
(2001) identified 37 TRIM members in mammals, 21 of which were novel, as
well as 34 splice variants. TRIM5 has 6 variants termed alpha, beta,
gamma, delta, epsilon, and zeta, all of which lack a B-box type 1
domain. Additional domains C-terminal to the CC region are variably
present. TRIM5-zeta lacks RING, B-box, and CC domains, but possesses 3
RFP-like domains. Northern blot analysis of adult human tissues detected
ubiquitous expression of TRIM5. Using interaction mating and mutation
analysis, Reymond et al. (2001) confirmed that TRIM5, like most TRIMs,
homointeracts through the CC region. Interaction was also detected with
TRIM6 (607564). Green fluorescent protein microscopy demonstrated
expression as cytoplasmic speckles, possibly in novel subcellular
compartments.

Stremlau et al. (2004) determined that human TRIM5-alpha contains 493
amino acids and includes a C-terminal b30.2 (SPRY) domain missing in
other TRIM5 isoforms.

GENE FUNCTION

By fluorescence microscopy and mutation analysis, Xu et al. (2003)
showed that TRIM5-delta interacts with BTBD1 (608530) and BTBD2
(608531), apparently serving as a scaffold for the assembly of
endogenous BTBD1/2 proteins, dependent on the presence of the CC region
and a wildtype RING domain. TRIM5-delta exhibits ubiquitylation in the
presence of UBCH5B (UBE2D2; 602962), dependent on the presence of
zinc-coordinating cysteines in the RING domain.

Kaiser et al. (2007) reported the reconstruction of the core protein of
a 4-million-year-old endogenous virus from the chimpanzee genome
(PtERV1) and showed that the human variant of the intrinsic immune
protein TRIM5-alpha can actively prevent infection by this virus.
However, Kaiser et al. (2007) suggested that the selective changes that
have occurred in the human lineage during the acquisition of resistance
to this virus, and perhaps similar viruses, may have left our species
more susceptible to infection by HIV-1.

Pertel et al. (2011) demonstrated that TRIM5 promotes innate immune
signaling and that this activity is amplified by retroviral infection
and interaction with the capsid lattice. Acting with the heterodimeric
ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC13-UEV1A, TRIM5 catalyzes the synthesis
of unattached K63-linked ubiquitin chains that activate the TAK1
(602614) kinase complex and stimulate AP1 (see 165160) and NF-kappa-B
(see 164011) signaling. Interaction with the HIV-1 capsid lattice
greatly enhanced the UBC13-UEV1A-dependent E3 activity of TRIM5, and
challenge with retroviruses induced the transcription of AP1- and
NF-kappa-B-dependent factors with a magnitude that tracked with TRIM5
avidity for the invading capsid. Finally, TAK1 and UBC13-UEV1A
contributed to capsid-specific restriction by TRIM5. Pertel et al.
(2011) concluded that the retroviral restriction factor TRIM5 has 2
additional activities that are linked to restriction: it constitutively
promotes innate immune signaling, and it acts as a pattern recognition
receptor specific for the retrovirus capsid lattice.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Reymond et al. (2001) mapped the TRIM5
gene to chromosome 11p15, in a cluster with TRIM6, TRIM21 (109092),
TRIM22 (606559), TRIM34 (605684), and a TRIM pseudogene. The authors
noted that, apart from another cluster in the HLA region (chromosome
6p21-23), TRIM genes are dispersed throughout the genome.

ANIMAL MODEL

Stremlau et al. (2004) noted that HIV-1, the cause of acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in humans, efficiently enters the cells
of Old World monkeys but encounters a block before reverse
transcription. The block acts on the HIV-1 capsid and is mediated by a
dominant repressive factor. By screening HeLa cell lines transduced with
a cDNA library from rhesus fibroblasts, Stremlau et al. (2004)
identified HeLa cells expressing rhesus TRIM5-alpha. These cells were
resistant to HIV-1 but not simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)
infection. PCR analysis indicated a disruption of viral cDNA synthesis
in rhesus TRIM5-alpha-expressing cells. Mutation analysis suggested that
both the N-terminal RING and C-terminal SPRY domains of rhesus
TRIM5-alpha contribute to its HIV-1 inhibitory activity. Short
interfering (si) RNA experiments reducing rhesus TRIM5-alpha expression
resulted in increased efficiency of HIV-1 infection. Stremlau et al.
(2004) concluded that monkey TRIM5-alpha is the repressive factor
inhibiting HIV-1 reverse transcription and proposed that rhesus
TRIM5-alpha may directly bind and ubiquitinate the HIV-1 viral capsid.

Sayah et al. (2004) showed that knockdown of owl monkey CYPA (123840) by
RNA interference (RNAi) correlated with suppression of anti-HIV-1
activity. However, reintroduction of CYPA to RNAi-treated cells did not
restore antiviral activity. A search for additional RNAi targets
identified TRIMCYP, an RNAi-responsive mRNA encoding a TRIM5/CYPA fusion
protein. TRIMCYP accounts for post-entry restriction of HIV-1 in owl
monkeys and blocks HIV-1 infection when transferred to otherwise
infectable human or rat cells. Sayah et al. (2004) suggested that
TRIMCYP arose after the divergence of New and Old World primates when a
LINE-1 retrotransposon catalyzed the insertion of a CYPA cDNA into the
TRIM5 locus. They concluded that this was the first vertebrate example
of a chimeric gene generated by this mechanism of exon shuffling.

Sakuma et al. (2007) showed that rhesus Trim5-alpha, but not human
TRIM5-alpha, blocked late-phase HIV-1 production through rapid
degradation of HIV-1 Gag polyproteins. In agreement with Sakuma et al.
(2007), Zhang et al. (2008) found that rhesus Trim5-alpha could block
late-stage HIV-1, but not macaque SIV, production. However, the amount
of Trim5-alpha required for this effect was much higher than that
endogenously expressed, and they questioned the biologic significance of
the finding. In a reply, Sakuma et al. (2008) suggested that technical
differences, such as cell lines and capsid sequences, may explain the
need for high Trim5-alpha expression in the experiments of Zhang et al.
(2008).

613726	TITLE *613726 ANOCTAMIN 10; ANO10
;;TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN 16K; TMEM16K
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ANO10 belongs to a family of calcium-activated chloride channels (review
by Hartzell et al., 2009).

CLONING

Vermeer et al. (2010) stated that the deduced ANO10 protein contains 660
amino acids. Quantitative PCR detected ANO10 expression in all tissues
examined, with highest expression in whole adult brain, followed by
retina and heart. Within specific adult brain regions, highest
expression was detected in frontal and occipital cortices and in
cerebellum. Expression in fetal brain was lower than in adult whole
brain.

GENE STRUCTURE

Vermeer et al. (2010) determined that the ANO10 gene spans 2.7 kb and
contains 13 exons, 12 of which are coding.

MAPPING

Vermeer et al. (2010) stated that the ANO10 gene maps to chromosome
3p22.3-p21.32. Gross (2011) mapped the ANO10 gene to chromosome 3p22.1
based on an alignment of the ANO10 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK096302)
with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 3 unrelated families with autosomal recessive
spinocerebellar ataxia-10 (SCAR10; 613728), Vermeer et al. (2010)
identified homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the ANO10
gene (613726.0001-613726.0004). The neurodegenerative disorder was
characterized by onset in the teenage or young adult years of gait and
limb ataxia, dysarthria, and nystagmus associated with marked cerebellar
atrophy on brain imaging.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 10
ANO10, LEU510ARG

In affected members of a Dutch family with autosomal recessive
spinocerebellar ataxia-10 (SCAR10; 613728), Vermeer et al. (2010)
identified a homozygous 1529T-G transversion in exon 10 of the ANO10
gene, resulting in a leu510-to-arg (L510R) substitution in a highly
conserved residue in the DUF590 domain. The mutation was not found in
300 control alleles. The family was remotely consanguineous.

.0002
SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 10
ANO10, 2-BP DEL, 1150TT

In 3 affected sibs of a consanguineous family of Romani origin from
Serbia with SCAR10 (613728), Vermeer et al. (2010) identified a
homozygous 2-bp deletion (1150delTT) in the ANO10 gene, predicted to
result in a frameshift and premature termination in exon 6.

.0003
SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 10
ANO10, IVS9DS, G-T, +1

In 2 French sibs with SCAR10 (613728), Vermeer et al. (2010) identified
compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the ANO10 gene: a G-to-T
transversion in intron 9 (1476+1G-T), predicted to result in a splice
site mutation, and a deletion at nucleotide 1604, resulting in premature
termination at codon 535 (613726.0004).

MIXED LINEAGE LEUKEMIA, TRANSLOCATED TO, 2;;
ALL1-FUSED GENE FROM CHROMOSOME 4; AF4
DESCRIPTION The ALL1 gene (MLL; 159555), located at 11q23, is rearranged in acute
leukemias with reciprocal translocations between this region and
chromosomes 1, 4, 6 (159559), 9 (159558), 10, or 19 (159556). Gu et al.
(1992) studied the t(4;11) translocation which results in 2 reciprocal
fusion products coding for chimeric proteins derived from ALL1 and from
a gene on chromosome 4. They referred to the latter as AF4 for
'ALL1-fused gene from chromosome 4.' Fused RNAs were found in the three
t(4;11) cells lines studied; therefore, Gu et al. (1992) could not
establish which of the 2 products is oncogenic.

Nakamura et al. (1993) found that the gene on chromosome 4q21 that is
fused with the ALL1 gene in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia
and translocation t(4;11)(q21;q23) and the gene on chromosome 9 that is
fused with the ALL1 gene on chromosome 11 in patients with leukemia and
the t(9;11)(p22;q23) show high sequence homology with the ENL gene on
chromosome 19, which is fused to the ALL1 gene in patients with leukemia
and the translocation t(11;19)(q23;p13). They found further that the
protein products of the AF4, AF9 (MLLT3), and ENL (MLLT1) genes
contained nuclear targeting sequences as well as serine-rich and
proline-rich regions. Stretches abundant in basic amino acids were also
present in the 3 proteins. These results indicated that the different
proteins fused to ALL1 polypeptides in leukemia provide similar
functional domains.

Domer et al. (1993) independently demonstrated that the derivative
chromosome 11, carrying a translocated segment of chromosome 4, encodes
a fusion RNA which predicts a chimeric protein with features of the MLL
gene on 11q23 and the AF4 gene on 4q21. The sequence of the complete
open reading frame for this fusion transcript revealed that the MLL
protein is homologous with DNA methyltransferase, the Drosophila
trithorax gene product, and the 'AT-hook' motif of high mobility group
proteins. An alternative splice that deletes the AT-hook region of MLL
was identified. AF4 is a serine- and proline-rich putative transcription
factor with a glutamine-rich carboxyl terminus. The composition of the
complete MLL-AF4 fusion product argues that it may act through either a
gain-of-function or a dominant-negative mechanism in leukemogenesis.
This gene is also symbolized MLLT2.

Uckun et al. (1998) analyzed bone marrow leukemic cells of 17 infants
and 127 children with newly diagnosed acute lymphatic leukemia (ALL), as
well as fetal liver and bone marrow and normal infant bone marrow
samples for the presence of a t(4;11) translocation, using standard
cytogenetic techniques and expression of an MLL-AF4 fusion transcript by
standard RT-PCR assays as well as nested RT-PCR that is 100-fold more
sensitive than the standard RT-PCR. Overall, 9 of the 17 infants and 17
of 127 noninfant pediatric ALL patients were positive for expression of
MLL-AF4 fusion transcripts. None of the MLL-AF4(+) cases were positive
for E2A-PBX1 (147141; 176310) or BCR-ABL (151410; 189980) fusion
transcript expression. Although 8 of 9 MLL-AF4(+) infants had
cytogenetically detectable t(4;11) translocation, 15 of the 17
MLL-AF4(+) noninfants were t(4;11) negative. Infants with MLL-AF4(+) ALL
had poor outcomes, whereas noninfant fusion-gene-positive,
translocation-negative patients has favorable outcomes similar to
MLL-AF4(-) patients. Notably, MLL-AF4 transcripts also were detected by
nested RT-PCR in 4 of 16 fetal bone marrows, 5 of 13 fetal livers, and 1
of 6 normal infant bone marrows, but not in any of the 44 remission bone
marrow specimens from pediatric ALL patients. These results represented
unprecedented evidence that MLL-AF4 fusion transcripts can be present in
normal hematopoietic cells, indicating that their expression is
insufficient for leukemic transformation of normal lymphocyte
precursors.

Isnard et al. (1998) isolated cDNA clones of the mouse Af4 gene. By
Northern analysis, they detected a single transcript of approximately 10
kb in all adult tissues examined, with highest expression in thymus,
lymph nodes, and kidney. They also studied expression in fetal thymus
and liver. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, they showed that the
Af4 gene maps to the E region of mouse chromosome 5, which is syntenic
with human 4q21.

To gain insight into the translocation mechanism and the relevant drug
exposure in treatment-related leukemia, Lovett et al. (2001) analyzed
the der(11) and der(4) genomic breakpoint junctions of a t(4;11)
translocation in the leukemia of a patient previously administered
etoposide and dactinomycin for the chemotherapy of primary alveolar
rhabdomyosarcoma (268220). The genomic breakpoint junctions involved
intron 6 of the MLL gene and intron 3 of the AF4 gene. Recombination was
precise at the sequence level except for the overall gain of a single
templated nucleotide. The translocation breakpoints in MLL and AF4 were
DNA topoisomerase II cleavage sites. Etoposide and its metabolites, but
not dactinomycin, enhanced cleavage at these sites on in vitro
incubation. The findings were inconsistent with a translocation
mechanism involving interchromosomal recombination by simple exchange of
DNA topoisomerase II subunits and DNA-strand transfer. Etoposide and/or
its metabolites were considered the relevant exposures in this patient.

602559	TITLE *602559 EXPORTIN 1; XPO1
;;REQUIRED FOR CHROMOSOME REGION MAINTENANCE; CRM1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Human CRM1, or XPO1, is the homolog of yeast crm1 (named for 'required
for chromosome region maintenance'), a nuclear protein essential for
proliferation and chromosome region maintenance. Fornerod et al. (1997)
used the oncogenic nucleoporin CAN (114350) to coprecipitate human CRM1.
The complete cDNA encodes a predicted protein of 1,071 amino acids with
a predicted molecular mass of 123 kD. The CRM1 protein migrates at 112
kD. Human CRM1 has 47% identity with S. cerevisiae crm1 and 52% identity
with S. pombe crm1+. The N terminus of human CRM1 shares significant
homology with the N terminus of importin-beta. Fornerod et al. (1997)
identified a group of largely uncharacterized yeast and vertebrate
proteins of similar size (110 to 120 kD) that share this homology
domain, which they proposed to call the CRIME domain (for 'CRM1,
importin-beta, etc.').

Kudo et al. (1997) cloned human CRM1 cDNA using sequence information
from EST databases and a PCR-based strategy based on the sequence of S.
pombe crm1+. Northern blot analysis using the C-terminal region of human
CRM1 cDNA as a probe revealed a major transcript of 5.6 kb expressed in
all tissues tested except kidney.

GENE FUNCTION

Kudo et al. (1997) found that Human CRM1 weakly complemented the
cold-sensitive mutation of S. pombe crm1-809. Overproduction of human
CRM1 suppressed cell proliferation in wildtype S. pombe in an expression
level-dependent manner. Overexpression of native S. pombe crm1+ had the
same effect. Northern blot analysis with RNAs isolated from synchronized
mammalian cells showed that the expression of mammalian CRM1 was
initiated in the late G1 phase and reached a peak at G2/M, although the
protein level did not change during the cell cycle. Human CRM1 fused to
green fluorescent protein (GFP) and transiently expressed in NIH 3T3
cells showed that human CRM1 was localized preferentially in the nuclear
envelope, but was also detectable in the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm.
A crm1 mutation of S. pombe caused nuclear import of a GFP fusion
protein containing a nuclear export signal (NES) but no change in the
distribution of a GFP fusion protein containing a nuclear localization
signal (NLS). These data suggested to Kudo et al. (1997) that CRM1 is a
novel cell cycle-regulated gene that is essential for the NES-dependent
nuclear export of proteins.

CRM1 protein binds CAN and NUP88 (602552), and its association with the
nuclear pore is dynamic (Fornerod et al., 1997). To test whether CRM1
could be a nuclear export receptor, Fornerod et al. (1997) used Xenopus
oocytes incubated in leptomycin B, a cytotoxin which blocks Rev export
and Rev-mediated RNA export in tissue culture cells. Leptomycin B
interacted directly with CRM1, as shown by gel shift assays, and blocked
export of Rev and U snRNAs from Xenopus oocyte nucleus. Overexpression
of CRM1 stimulated Rev and U snRNA export from the nucleus. Fornerod et
al. (1997) found that an NES/CRM1/Ran complex forms in the presence of
RanGTP. Leptomycin B blocks formation of this complex. Fornerod et al.
(1997) concluded that CRM1 is an export receptor for leucine-rich NESs.
Noting that CRM1 is a member of a family of proteins related to
importin-beta, Fornerod et al. (1997) suggested the descriptive name
'exportins' for those family members involved in nuclear export.

Stade et al. (1997) characterized CRM1 as an essential nuclear export
factor in S. cerevisiae and proposed that CRM1 be renamed 'exportin-1,'
symbolized XPO1. XPO1 protein is localized in the nucleus at steady
state but is capable of shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm.
Stade et al. (1997) constructed an NES-GFP-NLS substrate which shuttled
continuously between the nucleus and cytoplasm, but appeared largely
cytoplasmic, presumably due to a higher rate of export. In yeast
containing a temperature-sensitive mutation in CRM1, the substrate
became nuclear within 5 minutes at high temperature, indicating that the
mutation blocks NES export. High temperature also blocked mRNA export in
yeast. A 2-hybrid analysis showed an interaction between NES and CRM1
and between Ran and CRM1.

The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(KIP1) (CDKN1B; 600778) is
degraded during the cell cycle by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.
Using NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts and mouse embryonic fibroblasts, Kamura
et al. (2004) found that a complex made up of Kpc1 (RNF123; 614472) and
Kpc2 (UBAC1; 608129) ubiquitinated cytoplasmic p27(KIP1) at G1 phase and
that cytoplasmic degradation of p27(KIP1) required p27(KIP1) nuclear
export by Crm1.

A single transcript in its unspliced and spliced forms directs synthesis
of all human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 proteins. Although nuclear
export of intron-containing cellular transcripts is restricted in
mammalian cells, HIV-1 has evolved the viral Rev protein to overcome
this restriction for viral transcripts. CRM1 is a cellular cofactor for
Rev-dependent export of intron-containing HIV-1 RNA. Yedavalli et al.
(2004) presented evidence that Rev/CRM1 activity uses the ATP-dependent
RNA helicase DDX3 (300160). They showed that DDX3 is a nucleocytoplasmic
shuttling protein that binds CRM1 and localizes to nuclear membrane
pores. Knockdown of DDX3 using either antisense vector or
dominant-negative mutants suppressed Rev-RRE (Rev response element)
function in the export of incompletely spliced HIV-1 RNAs. Yedavalli et
al. (2004) concluded that DDX3 is the human RNA helicase that functions
in the CRM1 RNA export pathway analogously to the postulated role for
Dbp5 (605812) in yeast mRNA export.

For a review of nuclear export receptors, see Ullman et al. (1997).

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Dong et al. (2009) presented a 2.9-angstrom resolution crystal structure
of CRM1 bound to snurportin (SNUPN1; 607902). Snurportin-1 binds CRM1 in
a bipartite manner by means of an N-terminal leucine-rich nuclear export
signal (LR-NES) and its nucleotide-binding domain. The LR-NES is a
combined alpha-helical-extended structure that occupies a hydrophobic
groove between 2 CRM1 outer helices. The LR-NES interface explains the
consensus hydrophobic pattern, preference for intervening
electronegative residues, and inhibition by leptomycin B. The second
nuclear export signal epitope is a basic surface on the snurportin-1
nucleotide-binding domain, which binds an acidic patch on CRM1 adjacent
to the LR-NES site. Multipartite recognition of individually weak
nuclear export signal epitopes may be common to CRM1 substrates,
enhancing CRM1 binding beyond the generally low affinity LR-NES. Similar
energetic construction is also used in multipartite nuclear localization
signals to provide broad substrate specificity and rapid evolution in
nuclear transport.

Monecke et al. (2009) presented the crystal structure of the
SPN1-CRM1-RanGTP (see 601179) export complex at 2.5-angstrom resolution.
SPN1 is a nuclear import adapter for cytoplasmically assembled, m3G
(5-prime-2,2,7-terminal trimethylguanosine)-capped spliceosomal U
snRNPs. The structure showed how CRM1 can specifically return the
cargo-free form of SPN1 to the cytoplasm. The extensive contact area
includes 5 hydrophobic residues at the SPN1 amino terminus that dock
into a hydrophobic cleft of CRM1, as well as numerous hydrophilic
contacts of CRM1 to m3G cap-binding domain and carboxyl-terminal
residues of SPN1. Monecke et al. (2009) concluded that RanGTP promotes
cargo binding to CRM1 solely through long-range conformational changes
in the exportin.

MAPPING

The CRM1 gene maps to human chromosome 2p16 by fluorescence in situ
hybridization (Fornerod et al., 1997).

608536	TITLE *608536 GTP-BINDING PROTEIN 3; GTPBP3
;;MSS1, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; MSS1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Mss1 is a yeast mitochondrial GTP-binding protein that functionally
interacts with 15S rRNA. By searching an EST database for sequences
similar to Mss1, followed by RT-PCR using hepatoma cell line total RNA
and 5-prime and 3-prime RACE, Li and Guan (2002) cloned 5 variants of
GTPBP3, an Mss1 homolog. The variants are generated by alternative
splicing and through the use of alternate polyadenylation signals. Two
variants differ only in their 3-prime UTRs and encode an identical
492-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 52.0 kD. Two
other variants encode an identical 471-amino acid protein, and another
variant encodes a 524-amino acid protein. GTPBP3 contains a typical
mitochondria targeting presequence, 2 GTP-binding domains, a p21 RAS
(see 190020)-like domain, and an SRC (190090) homology-3 (SH3) domain.
GTPBP3 shows extensive conservation of amino acid sequences with Mss1
homologs from several diverse species, including bacteria, yeast, and
nematode. Mouse and human GTPBP3 share 81% amino acid identity. Northern
blot analysis detected ubiquitous expression of 2.6- and 1.9-kb
transcripts. Expression was highest in skeletal muscle, kidney, liver,
and heart, moderate in whole brain, thymus, spleen, and small intestine,
and low in colon, lung, and leukocytes. GTPBP3 was also expressed in all
individual brain regions examined. The larger transcript was more
abundant in most tissues. GTPBP3 colocalized with a mitochondrial marker
in transfected osteosarcoma cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Yeast cells carrying mutant alleles of Mss1 coupled with a 15S rRNA
mutation that corresponds to the 1555A-G mutation of human 12S rRNA
(561000.0001) fail to synthesize subunit 1 of cytochrome oxidase (see
516030) and manifest a respiratory-deficient phenotype. Li and Guan
(2002) found that overexpression of GTPBP3 complemented the respiration
defect of yeast carrying the Mss1 and 15S rRNA mutations. They suggested
that, like yeast Mss1, GTPBP3 may influence the phenotypic expression of
the 1555A-G mutation in 12S rRNA.

GENE STRUCTURE

Li and Guan (2002) determined that the GTPBP3 gene contains 9 exons and
spans more than 6 kb. There are 2 putative polyadenylation signals.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Li and Guan (2002) mapped the GTPBP3 gene
to chromosome 19.

601791	TITLE *601791 PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS FACTOR 14; PEX14
;;PEROXIN 14;;
NFE2-ASSOCIATED POLYPEPTIDE 2; NAPP2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Working with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Albertini et al. (1997) described
peroxin-14 (PEX14), the first membrane-bound peroxisomal protein that
binds to the peroxisomal type-2 targeting signal (PTS2) receptor, PEX7
(601757). Thus, the PEX14 protein may represent the functional docking
site for PTS2-dependent protein import to the peroxisome. In addition to
the interaction with the PTS2 receptor, PEX14 protein was found to
interact with PEX5 protein (600414), the PTS1 receptor. This observation
suggested the overlapping of 2 import pathways, with PEX14 being the
point of convergence. Moreover, PEX14 also interacted with 2 other
membrane-bound peroxins, including the SH3 domain protein PEX13
(601789), the putative docking protein for PTS1-dependent protein
import. Albertini et al. (1997) proposed that these 3 peroxins are
components of a common translocation machinery.

Using yeast Pex14 sequences to probe EST databases, Fransen et al.
(1998) identified a cDNA encoding PEX14. The deduced 377-amino acid
protein contains a nonmembrane-spanning hydrophobic region, a
coiled-coil region, and a charged, acidic C terminus; it has no class II
SH3-binding motif. Western blot analysis showed expression of a 57-kD
protein.

By searching an EST database using S. cerevisiae Pex14 as query, Will et
al. (1999) identified a cDNA encoding PEX14 in a breast cell library.
The deduced protein contains 2 conserved coiled-coil region and has a
calculated molecular mass of about 41 kD. The human and yeast proteins
share 26% identity. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a
2.1-kb transcript in all tissues examined. Western blot analysis of
human fibroblast and in vitro translated protein revealed an apparent
molecular mass of about 55 kD, which may reflect its high content of
acidic amino acids. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed
colocalization with peroxisomal catalase. PEX14 was found in the
particulate fraction of fractionated cells and resisted salt or alkali
extraction, suggesting that it is an integral membrane protein. Protease
protection assays indicated that the C terminus is cytosolic and that
the N terminus likely protrudes into the peroxisomal lumen.

Gavva et al. (2002) identified PEX14, which they called NAPP2, as a
protein in an erythroleukemia expression library that interacted with
nuclear factor erythroid-2 (NFE2; 601490). Northern blot analysis
revealed a transcript of about 2 kb expressed in all cell lines tested.

GENE FUNCTION

Ligand blot analysis by Fransen et al. (1998) determined that PEX14
binds to both the PTS1 receptor (PEX5) and weakly with the SH3 domain of
PEX13. Biochemical analysis indicated that PEX14 is required for the
import of PTS1-containing proteins into peroxisomes.

Will et al. (1999) found that Pex14 deficiency in S. cerevisiae could
not be rescued by expression of human PEX14, indicating that the
proteins are not functionally interchangeable. Overexpression of PEX14
in normal skin fibroblasts led to the decoration of tubular structures
and mislocalization of peroxisomal catalase to the cytosol. Unlike the
findings in yeast, PEX14 did not form homooligomers or interact with
PTS2 receptor or PEX13.

By in vitro binding assays of truncated recombinant proteins, Gavva et
al. (2002) found that interaction between PEX14 and NFE2 occurs through
the N-terminal 203 amino acids of PEX14 and the N-terminal 114 amino
acids of NFE2. Expression of PEX14 inhibited NFE2-directed
transcriptional activation. PEX14 also functioned as a corepressor and
interacted specifically with HDAC1 (601241), but not with HDAC2 (605164)
or HDAC3 (605166).

MAPPING

By FISH, Gavva et al. (2002) mapped the PEX14 gene to chromosome 1p36.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a patient with Zellweger syndrome (PBD13A; 614887), Shimozawa et al.
(2004) identified a gln185-to-ter mutation in the PEX14 gene (Q185X;
601791.0001). Although PEX14 mutants had been identified in yeast and in
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, this was said to be the first
reported case of human PEX14 deficiency. Shimozawa et al. (2004) stated
that PEX14 is a member of the complementation group of peroxisome
biogenesis disorders, and designated it complementation group K. PEX14
rescued the import of a PTS1-dependent as well as a PTS2-dependent
protein into the peroxisomes in fibroblasts from the patient. The
patient's fibroblasts lacked PEX14, as determined by immunocytochemical
analysis.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 13A (ZELLWEGER)
PEX14, GLN185TER

In an infant with Zellweger syndrome (PBD13A; 614887), Shimozawa et al.
(2004) identified a homozygous 553C-T transition in the PEX14 gene,
resulting in a gln185-to-ter (Q185X) substitution in a putative
coiled-coil region of the protein. At birth the patient showed typical
craniofacial dysmorphia of Zellweger syndrome, including large open
fontanels, high forehead, flat occiput, low/broad nasal bridge, and
micrognathia, as well as neurologic abnormalities including hypotonia.
Plasma analysis showed elevated very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) and
di- and trihydroxycholestanoic acid, and a normal phytanic acid level.
Erythrocyte plasmalogens were undetectable. The patient died at 10 days
of age.

PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 13A (ZELLWEGER)
PEX14, 41-KB DEL

In a Pakistani patient with Zellweger syndrome (PBD13A; 614887), born of
related parents, Huybrechts et al. (2008) identified a homozygous 41-kb
deletion in the PEX14 gene, resulting in the deletion of exon 3,
frameshift, and premature protein truncation. Cultured skin fibroblasts
from the patient showed absence of PEX14 protein and absence of normal
peroxisomes. The patient had severe cholestasis and hepatomegaly,
neuronal migration defect, and progressive hypotonia.

CLONING

Albig et al. (1991) identified a gene encoding a member of the H1 class
of histones and designated it H1.4.

GENE FUNCTION

See HIST1H1A (142709) for functional information on H1 histones.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, Tanguay et al. (1987) mapped the histone H1.4
gene to chromosome 12q11-q21. On the other hand, Albig et al. (1993)
mapped 6 H1 genes, including H1.4, to chromosome 6p22.1-p21.1. By
analysis of a YAC contig, Albig et al. (1997) mapped the H1.4 gene to
chromosome 6p21.3, within a cluster of 35 histone genes.

By genomic sequence analysis, Marzluff et al. (2002) determined that the
histone gene cluster on chromosome 6p22-p21, which they called histone
gene cluster-1 (HIST1), contains 55 histone genes, including HIST1H1E.

;;BNIP2-SIMILAR; BNIPS;;
BNIPL1;;
BNIPL2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database analysis using full-length BNIP2 (603292) or its BNIP2 and
CDC42GAP (ARHGAP1; 602732) homology (BCH) domain as probe, followed by
5-prime RACE of human kidney epithelial cells, Zhou et al. (2002) cloned
BNIPL, which they called BNIPS. They identified 2 alternative splicing
isoforms, a deduced 275-amino acid BNIPS-alpha isoform and a deduced
204-amino acid BNIPS-beta isoform. The BNIPS-alpha isoform shared 46%
identity with BNIP2 with higher similarity over the BCH domain, which is
predicted to comprise several alpha helices. PCR analysis detected
differing levels of expression of the BNIPS-alpha and BNIPS-beta
isoforms in a number of human cancer cell lines including breast cancer
MCF-7, HeLa cells, 293T embryonic transformed kidney epithelial cells,
and stomach and colon cancer cell lines. PCR analysis of mouse tissues
detected expression of BNIPS-alpha in all tissues examined.
Immunofluorescence studies localized the BNIPS-alpha isoform to the
cytosol and BNIPS-beta primarily to the nucleus.

Using a high-throughput transfection screen for suppressors of cell
growth from a human placental cDNA library, followed by 5-prime RACE,
Qin et al. (2003) independently cloned BNIPL. They identified 2
alternatively spliced isoforms that used different start codons: a
deduced 275-amino acid isoform, BNIPL1, isoform identical to the
BNIPS-alpha isoform isolated by Zhou et al. (2002) and a longer
357-amino acid isoform, BNIPL2, containing 82 additional N-terminal
amino acids, followed by the 275-amino acid sequence identical to
BNIPL1. By Northern blot analysis of human tissues, Shen et al. (2003)
detected a 2.4-kb BNIPL transcript in placenta and lung.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhou et al. (2002) showed that overexpression of the BNIPS-alpha isoform
in human breast cancer cells caused cell rounding, which was accompanied
by annexin V (ANXA5; 131230) binding, cell shrinkage, and detachment.
BNIPS-beta showed no change in cell morphology. The BCH domain was
required for proapoptotic activity. Zhou et al. (2002) concluded that
BNIPS-alpha induces apoptosis.

Using yeast 2-hybrid and pull-down affinity studies, Qin et al. (2003)
showed that the BCH domain of the BNIPL2 isoform interacted with Bcl2
(151430), Cdc42GAP, and with itself. They demonstrated that the BCH
domain was responsible for the ability of BNIPL2 to suppress GAP
activity of Cdc42GAP toward CDC42 (116952) and for the proapoptotic
function of BNIPL2. Shen et al. (2003) showed that overexpression of
BNIPL inhibited cell growth in human hepatocarcinoma cells. Using in
vivo and in vitro assays, they found that BNIPL interacted with MIF
(153620) and GFER (600924).

GENE STRUCTURE

Qin et al. (2003) determined that the BNIPL gene contains 10 exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Qin et al. (2003) mapped the BNIPL gene to

HP1, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, BETA;;
HP1-BETA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Heterochromatin protein-1 (HP1) is localized at heterochromatin sites,
where it mediates gene silencing.

CLONING

Some autoimmune sera recognize antigens located near the centromere
(CENPA, 117139; CENPB, 117140; CENPC1, 117141) as well as
heterochromatin protein-1 (HP1). Using human autoimmune serum to screen
a HepG2 library, Furuta et al. (1997) isolated a cDNA encoding CBX1, a
human homolog of Drosophila HP1, which the authors called HP1-beta. CBX1
encodes a 185-amino acid protein that has 66% sequence identity and 80%
similarity to CBX5 (604478). CBX1 is 100% identical to mouse M31 and to
human HSM1, which was identified by Singh et al. (1991). CBX1 has a
conserved 37-amino acid region called the chromodomain, or chromobox, in
the N-terminal region. Immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that only
antibodies directed against the C terminus of CBX1 showed nucleoplasmic
and heterochromatin staining. N-terminal-specific antibodies were
nonreactive. The C-terminal domain antibodies were also reactive with
the centromeric region during metaphase and anaphase and with whole
chromosomes during telophase.

GENE FUNCTION

Lachner et al. (2001) showed that mammalian methyltransferases that
selectively methylate histone H3 (see 602810) on lysine-9 (Suv39h
HMTases; see SUV39H1, 300254) generate a binding site for HP1 proteins,
a family of heterochromatic adaptor molecules implicated in both gene
silencing and supranucleosomal chromatin structure. High-affinity in
vitro recognition of a methylated histone H3 peptide by HP1 requires a
functional chromodomain; thus, the HP1 chromodomain is a specific
interaction motif for the methyl epitope on lysine-9 of histone H3. In
vivo, heterochromatin association of HP1 proteins is lost in Suv39h
double-null primary mouse fibroblasts but is restored after
reintroduction of a catalytically active SUV39H1 HMTase. Lachner et al.
(2001) concluded that their data define a molecular mechanism through
which the SUV39H-HP1 methylation system can contribute to the
propagation of heterochromatic subdomains in native chromatin.

Bannister et al. (2001) demonstrated that HP1 can bind with high
affinity to histone H3 methylated at lysine-9 but not at lysine-4. They
identified the chromodomain of HP1 as its methyl-lysine-binding domain.
A point mutation in the chromodomain, which destroys the gene silencing
activity of HP1 in Drosophila, abolished methyl-lysine-binding activity.
Genetic and biochemical analysis in S. pombe showed that the methylase
activity of Clr4 (the SUV39H1 homolog) is necessary for the correct
localization of Swi6 (the HP1 equivalent) at centromeric heterochromatin
and for gene silencing. Bannister et al. (2001) concluded that these
results provide a stepwise model for the formation of a
transcriptionally silent heterochromatin: SUV39H1 places a methyl marker
on histone H3, which is then recognized by HP1 through its chromodomain.
This model may also explain the stable inheritance of the
heterochromatic state.

Eukaryotic genomes are organized into discrete structural and functional
chromatin domains. Noma et al. (2001) demonstrated that distinct
site-specific histone H3 methylation patterns define euchromatic and
heterochromatic chromosomal domains within an 47-kb region of the mating
type locus in fission yeast. H3 methylated at lysine-9, and its
interacting Swi6 protein, are strictly localized to a 20-kb silent
heterochromatic interval. In contrast, H3 methylated at lysine-4 is
specific to the surrounding euchromatic regions. Two inverted repeats
flanking the silent interval serve as boundary elements to mark the
borders between heterochromatin and euchromatin. Deletions of these
boundary elements leads to spreading of H3 lys9 methylation and Swi6
into neighboring sequences. Furthermore, the H3 lys6 methylation and
corresponding heterochromatin-associated complexes prevent H3 lys4
methylation in the silent domain.

Festenstein et al. (2003) used fluorescence recovery after
photobleaching to demonstrate that a GFP-HP1-beta fusion protein is
highly mobile within both the euchromatin and heterochromatin of ex vivo
resting murine T cells. Moreover, T cell activation greatly increased
this mobility, indicating that such a process may facilitate
(hetero)chromatin remodeling and permit access of epigenetic modifiers
and transcription factors to the many genes that are consequently
derepressed.

Cheutin et al. (2003) demonstrated that maintenance of stable
heterochromatin domains in living cells involves the transient binding
and dynamic exchange of HP1 from chromatin. HP1 exchange kinetics
correlated with the condensation level of chromatin and were dependent
on the histone methyltransferase Suv39h (300254). The chromodomain and
the chromoshadow domain of HP1 are both required for binding to native
chromatin in vivo, but they contribute differentially to binding in
euchromatin and heterochromatin. Cheutin et al. (2003) suggested that
their data argue against HP1 repression of transcription by formation of
static, higher order oligomeric networks but support a dynamic
competition model, and demonstrate that heterochromatin is accessible to
regulatory factors.

Fischle et al. (2005) demonstrated that HP1-alpha (604478), HP1-beta,
and HP1-gamma (604477) are released from chromatin during the M phase of
the cell cycle even though trimethylation levels of histone H3 lys9
remain unchanged. However, the additional transient modification of
histone H3 by phosphorylation of ser10 next to the more stable
methyl-lys9 mark is sufficient to eject HP1 proteins from their binding
sites. Inhibition or depletion of the mitotic kinase Aurora B (604970),
which phosphorylates histone H3 on ser10, causes retention of HP1
proteins on mitotic chromosomes, suggesting that H3 ser10
phosphorylation is necessary for the dissociation of HP1 from chromatin
in M phase. Fischle et al. (2005) concluded that their findings
establish a regulatory mechanism of protein-protein interactions,
through a combinatorial readout of 2 adjacent posttranslational
modifications: a stable methylation and a dynamic phosphorylation mark.

Smallwood et al. (2007) demonstrated that DNMT1 (126375) could interact
with HP1-alpha, HP1-beta, and HP1-gamma in a human colon carcinoma cell
line, resulting in stimulation of DNMT1 methyltransferase activity. The
HP1 proteins were sufficient to target DNMT1 activity in vivo, and
HP1-dependent repression required DNMT1. Smallwood et al. (2007)
demonstrated that HP1-alpha and HP1-beta were recruited to the survivin
(BIRC5; 603352) promoter in a DNMT1-dependent manner. They concluded
that direct interactions between HP1 proteins and DNMT1 mediate
silencing of euchromatic genes.

Ayoub et al. (2008) identified a dynamic change in chromatin that
promotes H2AX (601772) phosphorylation in mammalian cells. DNA breaks
swiftly mobilized HP1-beta, a chromatin factor bound to histone H3
methylated on lysine-9 (H3K9me; see 601128). Local changes in histone
tail modifications were not apparent. Instead, phosphorylation of
HP1-beta on amino acid thr51 accompanied mobilization, releasing
HP1-beta from chromatin by disrupting hydrogen bonds that fold its
chromodomain around H3K9me. Inhibition of casein kinase-2 (CK2; see
115442), an enzyme implicated in DNA damage sensing and repair,
suppressed thr51 phosphorylation and HP1-beta mobilization in living
cells. CK2 inhibition, or a constitutively chromatin-bound HP1-beta
mutant, diminished H2AX phosphorylation. Ayoub et al. (2008) concluded
that their findings revealed a signaling cascade that helps to initiate
the DNA damage response, altering chromatin by modifying a histone code
mediator protein, HP1, but not the code itself.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Nielsen et al. (2002) showed that HP1 uses an induced-fit mechanism to
recognize the methylation of lys9, as revealed by the structure of its
chromodomain bound to a histone H3 peptide dimethylated at N-zeta of
lys9. The binding pocket for the N-methyl groups is provided by 3
aromatic side chains, tyr21, trp42, and phe45, which reside in 2 regions
that become ordered on binding of the peptide. The side chain of lys9 is
almost fully extended and surrounded by residues that are conserved in
many other chromodomains. The QTAR peptide sequence preceding lys9
performs most of the additional interactions with the chromodomain, with
HP1 residues val23, leu40, trp42, leu58, and cys60 appearing to be a
major determinant of specificity by binding the key buried ala7. Nielsen
et al. (2002) concluded that their findings predict which other
chromodomains will bind methylated proteins and suggest a motif that
they might recognize.

164005	TITLE *164005 NUCLEAR FACTOR I/X; NFIX
;;NUCLEAR FACTOR I, X-TYPE;;
CCAAT-BINDING TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR;;
NF1A
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Nuclear factor I is a ubiquitous 47-kD dimeric DNA-binding protein whose
recognition sequence, TGG(C/A)N(5)GCCAA, is found in the genomes of a
number of DNA viruses. The same sequence occurs frequently in the human
genome. The NFI protein stimulates initiation of adenovirus DNA
replication in vitro and is capable of stimulating the transcription of
genes in cooperation with other factors, such as the estrogen receptor
(ESR; 133430). Santoro et al. (1988) gave a detailed analysis of NFI
cDNAs isolated from the human, which, with similar analyses in other
species, indicated that it is a member of a family of related proteins.
Four known variants were referred to as CTF, X, L, and Red. These are
the products of different genes, some of which (e.g., the first, CTF,
later symbolized NFIC; 600729) are subject to differential splicing.

Seisenberger et al. (1993) isolated 2 phages containing the second exon
and flanking intron regions of the human gene for NFI/X, which has been
designated NFIX.

Qian et al. (1995) isolated partial cDNA sequences from 4 nuclear factor
I proteins: NFIA (600727), NFIB (600728), NFIC, and NFIX.

GENE STRUCTURE

Grunder et al. (2003) determined that the NFIX gene contains 11 exons.
By ortholog comparisons using protein sequences from 7 vertebrate
species, they identified 9 NFIX variants that are produced by
alternative splicing.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Seisenberger et al. (1993) mapped
the NFIX gene to 19p13. Secondary sites of hybridization were observed
at 5p15, 1q42-q44, 1p22-p21, and 20p1.3; this hybridization was
attributed to partial sequence homologies with related NFI genes.

By FISH, Qian et al. (1995) mapped the NFIA and NFIB genes to
chromosomes 1p31.3-p31.2 and 9p24.1, respectively. The NFIC and NFIX
genes were both localized to 19p13.3 in the order cen--NFIX--NFIC--tel.
Comparison of the position of NFI genes and JUN genes revealed a close
physical linkage between members of the NFI and JUN gene families; for
example, one JUN gene (165160) is on 1p32-p31, and both JUNB (165161)
and JUND (165162) are located on 19p.

Scherthan et al. (1994) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to map
the murine Nfix gene to chromosome 8C1-C2, confirming the segmental
homology between human chromosome 19p13 and mouse chromosome 8C.
Although the location of the other NFI genes in the mouse had not been
established, Qian et al. (1995) suggested that from the imperative map
between human and mouse, the Nfia could be predicted to be located on
mouse chromosome 4 where the murine c-jun is located and the Nfic locus
on mouse chromosome 8 where the murine junD and junB genes are located.
They speculated further that a genomic unit containing an ancestral NFI
gene and an ancestral JUN gene existed early in evolution, later
duplicated twice, and then underwent further changes. If this hypothesis
is correct, one can suspect the existence of a fourth member of the JUN
gene family, probably located close to the NFIB gene. The postulated
fourth JUN gene would then be predicted to map to human 9 at 9p24.1 and
murine chromosome 4.

By FISH, Grunder et al. (2003) mapped the mouse Nfix gene to the distal
region of chromosome 8C.

GENE FUNCTION

Malan et al. (2010) performed RT-PCR analysis and demonstrated
ubiquitous expression of NFIX in all human tissues and cell types
tested, including chondrocytes and osteoblasts. In situ hybridization in
normal human embryos at CS17 (gestational day 42) showed a nearly
ubiquitous expression of NFIX, with prominent expression in the central
nervous system and the peripheral nervous system. In fetal brain at 22
weeks' gestation, NFIX was expressed in the cerebral cortex, in the
hippocampus, and faintly in the thalamus. In the skeleton, NFIX
expression was first noticed at CS17 in the mandibular arch, the
cartilage primordium of the humerus, the scapula, and the vertebrae. In
the limb, NFIX expression was first observed at CS17 in the
perichondrium. At 14 weeks' gestation, NFIX was highly expressed in the
proliferating zone of the digit. The study of distal femoral growth
plates of 1- to 5-week-old mice and human fetus revealed strong NFIX
expression in bone and in prehypertrophic chondrocytes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Sotos Syndrome 2

Malan et al. (2010) used a high-resolution array CGH in 18 patients with
unexplained syndromic overgrowth and identified 2 patients with a de
novo 19p13.1 monosomy. The deletions involved a single common gene,
NFIX. Malan et al. (2010) then screened 76 patients with unexplained
syndromic overgrowth for NIFX mutations and identified a heterozygous
nonsense mutation (Q190X; 164005.0001) in 1 patient who had been
diagnosed with a 'Sotos-like syndrome' (SOTOS2; 614753). This patient
and the 2 patients with 19p13.1 monosomy had a similar phenotype
consisting of postnatal overgrowth, macrocephaly, advanced bone age,
long narrow face, high forehead, slender habitus, scoliosis, unusual
behavior characterized especially by anxiety, and mental retardation.
The variant was not observed in 300 control chromosomes.

Yoneda et al. (2012) examined NFIX by high-resolution melt analysis in
48 individuals who were suspected of having Sotos syndrome but who did
not have NSD1 (606681) abnormalities, which are found in Sotos
syndrome-1. They identified 2 heterozygous missense mutations in the
DNA-binding/dimerization domain of the NFIX protein
(164005.0011-164005.0012). Neither mutation was found in 250 healthy
Japanese controls.

- Marshall-Smith Syndrome

Based on an Nfix-deficient mouse model with a phenotype similar to that
in Marshall-Smith syndrome (MRSHSS; 602535), Malan et al. (2010)
screened 9 individuals with MRSHSS for NFIX mutations and found
heterozygosity for 7 independent frameshift mutations
(164005.0002-164005.0008) and 2 different mutations within the donor
splice site of exon 6 (164005.0009-164005.0010). All of the mutations
occurred de novo and were not found in 300 control chromosomes.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Malan et al. (2010) performed RT-PCR analysis of skin fibroblasts in 1
SOTOS2 patient and 3 MRSHSS patients with NFIX mutations. They showed
that the SOTOS2 phenotype is due to NFIX haploinsufficiency, whereas the
mutated RNAs in MRSHSS escape nonsense-mediated decay surveillance.
Malan et al. (2010) suggested that NFIX mutations causing MRSHSS
generate mutant proteins able to exert a dominant-negative effect over
the wildtype allele and result in a more severe phenotype closely
resembling the knockout mouse model phenotype.

ANIMAL MODEL

Driller et al. (2007) obtained Nfix -/- mice at a normal mendelian
ratio, but nearly all died before 1 month of age. Although Nfix -/-
newborns appeared normal, they developed a dome-shaped head, were unable
to fully open their eyes, had deformation of the spine, exhibited an
ataxic gait, and were unable to gain weight. Heterozygous mice showed a
slight weight reduction, but had no obvious anatomic or behavioral
defects. Except for reduced size, most organs of Nfix -/- mice appeared
histologically normal. However, the smaller digestive tract showed
pathologic thinning of intestinal walls and reduced blood supply, and a
general loss of muscle tissue was observed. Hydrocephalus, which
developed after birth and progressed with age, was associated with
partial agenesis of the corpus callosum in Nfix -/- and Nfix +/- mice.
Skeletal pathology, including impaired endochondral ossification and
decreased mineralization in femoral bone, also progressed with age and
was associated with reduced expression of tetranecin (TNA; 187520), a
protein involved in mineralization.

NFIX gene, predicting a gln190-to-ter (Q190X) substitution. RT-PCR
analysis of NFIX RNA in skin fibroblasts from this patient showed the
expression of a single wildtype allele, indicating nonsense-mediated
mRNA decay and haploinsufficiency.

found in 250 healthy Japanese controls.

607796	TITLE *607796 PHD FINGER PROTEIN 11; PHF11
;;NY-REN-34
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using autologous antibody, Scanlan et al. (1999) cloned PHF11, which
they designated NY-REN-34, from a clear-cell renal carcinoma cDNA
library. The deduced 191-amino acid protein contains a zinc finger
motif. RT-PCR detected expression in all normal tissues tested,
including lung, testis, small intestine, breast, liver, and placenta.

Using a positional cloning approach, Zhang et al. (2003) cloned PHF11
from a quantitative trait locus on chromosome 13q14 that influences
immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels and asthma (147050). PCR analysis detected
several splice variants, 1 of which was expressed in all tissues
examined. A variant utilizing an alternative exon 1 was expressed in
immune-related tissues and cells. Variants utilizing 2 alternative exons
following exon 5, both of which contain premature stop codons, were
detected only in lung and unactivated peripheral blood leukocytes, but
not in activated cells.

- PHF11/SETDB2 Fusion Transcripts

Using primers designed from exons utilized by SETDB2 (607865) and PHF11,
Zhang et al. (2003) amplified PCR products that spanned both and
represented 3 alternatively spliced fusion transcripts. Expression of
each transcript was tissue specific and was detected in nearly all
tissues examined.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhang et al. (2003) determined that the PHF11 gene contains 10 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Scanlan et al. (1999) mapped the PHF11
gene to chromosome 13. Zhang et al. (2003) mapped the PHF11 gene to
chromosome 13q14. The SETDB2 gene is 4 kb proximal to the PHF11 gene and
is transcribed in the same direction.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Atopic or IgE-mediated diseases include the common disorders of asthma
(600807), atopic dermatitis (603165), and allergic rhinitis (607154).
Chromosome 13q14 shows consistent linkage to atopy and total serum IgE
concentration. Anderson et al. (2002) identified association between
total serum IgE levels and a novel 13q14 microsatellite (USAT24G1).
Zhang et al. (2003) localized the underlying quantitative trait locus
(QTL) in a comprehensive single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) map. They
found replicated association to IgE levels that was attributed to
several alleles in PHF11. They also found association with these
variants to severe clinical asthma.
