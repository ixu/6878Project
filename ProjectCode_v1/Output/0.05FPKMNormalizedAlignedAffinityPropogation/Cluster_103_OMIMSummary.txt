DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NFKB1 (164011) or NFKB2 (164012) is bound to REL (164910), RELA
(164014), or RELB (604758) to form the NFKB complex. The NFKB complex is
inhibited by I-kappa-B proteins (NFKBIA, 164008, or NFKBIB, 604495),
which inactivate NF-kappa-B by trapping it in the cytoplasm.
Phosphorylation of serine residues on the I-kappa-B proteins by kinases
(IKBKA or IKBKB, 603258) marks them for destruction via the
ubiquitination pathway, thereby allowing activation of the NF-kappa-B
complex. Activated NFKB complex translocates into the nucleus and binds
DNA at kappa-B-binding motifs such as 5-prime GGGRNNYYCC 3-prime or
5-prime HGGARNYYCC 3-prime (where H is A, C, or T; R is an A or G
purine; and Y is a C or T pyrimidine).

CLONING

Helix-loop-helix proteins contain stretches of DNA that encode 2
amphipathic alpha-helices joined by a loop structure and are involved in
protein dimerization and transcriptional regulation essential to a
variety of cellular processes. Mock et al. (1995) performed mapping
studies of a new member of this family of proteins in the human and
mouse. The protein contains a serine/threonine kinase domain; due to its
ubiquitous expression in a broad array of tissues and high degree of
conservation across species, it was designated CHUK for 'conserved
helix-loop-helix ubiquitous kinase.' The multidomain polypeptide encoded
by the CHUK gene also contains leucine zipper motifs.

DiDonato et al. (1997) purified a cytokine-activated protein kinase
complex, IKK (for I-kappa-B kinase), that phosphorylates I-kappa-B
proteins on the sites that trigger their degradation. They molecularly
cloned and identified a component of IKK, IKK-alpha (CHUK), as a serine
kinase. Mercurio et al. (1997) independently purified CHUK, which they
called IKK1, from HeLa cells. They found that mutant forms of IKK1 had
less effect upon NFKB activation than did mutant forms of IKK2 (also
called IKBKB, IKK-beta, or IKKB). IKK-alpha is approximately 50%
identical to IKK-beta (603258), and both contain kinase, leucine zipper,
and helix-loop-helix domains. Although IKK-alpha and IKK-beta can
homodimerize, heterodimerization appears to be favored over
homodimerization (Mercurio et al., 1997).

By use of NF-kappa-B-inducing kinase (NIK; 604655) as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen of a human B-cell line to identify NIK-interacting
proteins, Regnier et al. (1997) isolated CHUK, which phosphorylates
NFKBIA at ser32 and ser36 and NFKBIB at ser19 and ser23. The
phosphorylation of these proteins leads to the release of NFKB and
activation of nuclear genes. By screening a Jurkat T-cell cDNA library,
Regnier et al. (1997) obtained a full-length CHUK cDNA encoding a
745-amino acid protein that is 96% identical to mouse Chuk. A
catalytically inactive CHUK mutant acts as a dominant-negative inhibitor
of TNF (191160)-, IL1 (see 147760)-, TRAF2 (601895)-, and NIK-induced
NFKB activation.

Hu and Wang (1998) cloned and characterized IKKA and IKKB. Northern blot
analysis revealed expression of major 3.6- and minor 7.0-kb IKKA
transcripts in all tissues tested, with highest levels in heart,
placenta, skeletal muscle, kidney, pancreas, spleen, thymus, prostate,
testis, and peripheral blood. IKKB was also ubiquitously expressed as
major 3.4- and minor 6.5-kb transcripts. Expression of both transcripts
was highest in 7-day mouse embryonic tissue. Hu and Wang (1998)
suggested that IKKA and IKKB may be functionally related and cooperate
in cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Delhase et al. (1999) demonstrated that in mammalian cells,
phosphorylation of 2 sites at the activation loop of IKK-beta was
essential for activation of IKK by TNF and IL1. Elimination of
equivalent sites in IKK-alpha did not interfere with IKK activation.
Thus IKK-beta, not IKK-alpha, is the target for proinflammatory stimuli.
Once activated, IKK-beta autophosphorylated at a carboxy-terminal serine
cluster. This phosphorylation decreased IKK activity and was suggested
to prevent prolonged activation of the inflammatory response.

Ozes et al. (1999) showed that AKT1 (164730) is involved in the
activation of NFKB1 by TNF, following the activation of
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PIK3; see 171834). Constitutively active
AKT1 induces NFKB1 activity, mediated by phosphorylation of IKK-alpha at
threonine 23, which can be blocked by activated NIK. Conversely, NIK
activation of NFKB1, mediated by phosphorylation of IKK-alpha at serine
176, is blocked by an AKT1 mutant lacking kinase activity (i.e., kinase
dead AKT), indicating that both AKT1 and NIK are necessary for TNF
activation of NFKB1 through the phosphorylation of IKK-alpha. IKK-beta
is not phosphorylated by either NIK or AKT1 and is apparently
differentially regulated.

May et al. (2000) determined that an N-terminal alpha-helical region of
NEMO (300248) associates with a region of IKKA and IKKB that they termed
the NBD for 'NEMO-binding domain.' The NBD is a 6-amino acid C-terminal
segment within the region denoted alpha-2 of IKKA and IKKB. Wildtype,
but not mutant, NDB peptide inhibited cytokine-induced NFKB activation
and ameliorated experimental acute inflammation.

Anest et al. (2003) demonstrated nuclear accumulation of IKKA after
cytokine exposure, suggesting a nuclear function for this protein.
Consistent with this, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that
IKKA was recruited to the promoter regions of NF-kappa-B-regulated genes
on stimulation with TNFA (191160). Notably, NF-kappa-B-regulated gene
expression was suppressed by the loss of IKKA, and this correlated with
a complete loss of gene-specific phosphorylation of histone H3 (see
602810) on serine-10, a modification previously associated with positive
gene expression. Furthermore, Anest et al. (2003) showed that IKKA can
directly phosphorylate histone H3 in vitro, suggesting a new substrate
for this kinase. Anest et al. (2003) proposed that IKKA is an essential
regulator of NFKB-dependent gene expression through control of
promoter-associated histone phosphorylation after cytokine exposure.

Yamamoto et al. (2003) independently demonstrated that IKKA functions in
the nucleus to activate the expression of NF-kappa-B-responsive genes
after stimulation with cytokines. IKKA interactions with CREB-binding
protein (600140) and in conjunction with RELA (164014) is recruited to
NF-kappa-B-responsive promoters and mediates the cytokine-induced
phosphorylation and subsequent acetylation of specific residues in
histone H3. Yamamoto et al. (2003) concluded that their results define a
new nuclear role of IKKA in modifying histone function that is critical
for the activation of NF-kappa-B-directed gene expression.

Using mouse embryo fibroblasts lacking both Ikbkb and Ikbka, Sizemore et
al. (2004) found that both proteins were required for induction of a
subset of Ifng (147570)-stimulated genes independent of Nfkb activation
and with no defect in Stat1 (600555) activation or function. Sizemore et
al. (2004) concluded that the IKK-dependent pathway is an additional
important pathway for IFNG-stimulated gene expression.

Hoberg et al. (2004) presented evidence that IKK-alpha phosphorylates
chromatin-bound SMRT (NCOR2; 600848), stimulating its removal from
chromatin and allowing recruitment of NFKB to promoters and
transcription of NFKB-dependent genes.

Park et al. (2005) presented evidence that IKKA is important for the
activation of estrogen-mediated gene expression.

Lawrence et al. (2005) described a role for IKK-alpha in the negative
regulation of macrophage activation and inflammation. IKK-alpha
contributes to suppression of NF-kappa-B activity by accelerating both
the turnover of the NF-kappa-B subunits Rela and c-Rel and their removal
from proinflammatory gene promoters. Inactivation of IKK-alpha in mice
enhanced inflammation and bacterial clearance. Lawrence et al. (2005)
concluded that the 2 IKK catalytic subunits have evolved opposing but
complementary roles needed for the intricate control of inflammation and
innate immunity.

Werner et al. (2005) demonstrated that different inflammatory stimuli
induce distinct IKK profiles, and they examined the underlying molecular
mechanisms. Although TNFA-induced IKK activity was rapidly attenuated by
negative feedback, lipopolysaccharide signaling and
lipopolysaccharide-specific gene expression programs were dependent on a
cytokine-mediated positive feedback mechanism. Thus, Werner et al.
(2005) concluded that the distinct biologic responses to LPS and TNFA
depend on signaling pathway-specific mechanisms that regulate the
temporal profile of IKK activity.

Using an RNA interference-based screen, Tang et al. (2006) found 4
negative regulators of insulin-responsive glucose transport in mouse
adipocytes: Pctk1 (311550), Pftk1 (610679), Ikbka, and Map4k4 (604666).

Wu et al. (2006) demonstrated that NEMO (300248), the regulatory subunit
of the IKK complex, associates with activated ATM (607585) after the
induction of DNA double-strand breaks. ATM is exported in a
NEMO-dependent manner to the cytoplasm, where it associates with and
causes the activation of IKK in a manner dependent on another IKK
regulator, a protein rich in glutamate, leucine, lysine, and serine
(ELKS; 607127). Thus, Wu et al. (2006) concluded that regulated nuclear
shuttling of NEMO links 2 signaling kinases, ATM and IKK, to activate
NF-kappa-B by genotoxic signals.

TLR7 (300365) and TLR9 (605474) associate with the cytoplasmic adaptor
protein MYD88 (602170), which associates with IRF7 (605047). IRF7
associates with TRAF6 (602355) and IRAK1 (300283), and these 3 proteins
are critical for induction of IFNA (IFNA1; 147660) production, but not
cytokine production. Hoshino et al. (2006) found that mouse plasmacytoid
dendritic cells deficient in Ikka were severely impaired in Tlr7- or
Tlr9-induced Ifna production, but were able to produce detectable
inflammatory cytokines. Expression of a kinase-deficient Ikka inhibited
the ability of Myd88 or Traf6 to activate the Ifna promoter in synergy
with Irf7. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis showed that Ikka associated
with and phosphorylated Irf7. Hoshino et al. (2006) concluded that IKKA
is a critical component of the cytoplasmic
transductional-transcriptional processor leading to induction of IFNA
production.

Liu et al. (2006) identified somatic mutations in IKKA exon 15 in 8 of 9
squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) examined. More transition mutations than
transversion mutations were detected. In chemical carcinogen-induced
skin cancer in mice, overexpression of wildtype human IKKA reduced
development of SCCs and metastases. The IKKA transgene increased
terminal differentiation and reduced mitogenic activity in the
epidermis, and decreased angiogenic activity in the skin stroma. Liu et
al. (2006) concluded that IKKA in the epidermis antagonizes mitogenic
and angiogenic signals and represses tumor progression and metastases.

Zhu et al. (2007) identified 14-3-3-sigma (SFN; 601290) as a downstream
target of Ikka in cell cycle regulation in response to DNA damage and
found that the 14-3-3-sigma locus was hypermethylated in Ikka -/- mouse
keratinocytes, but not in wildtype keratinocytes. Trimethylated histone
H3-lys9 associated with Suv39h1 (300254) and Dnmt3a (602769) in the
methylated 14-3-3-sigma locus. Reintroduction of Ikka restored
14-3-3-sigma expression by associating with H3 and preventing access of
Suv39h1 to H3, thereby preventing hypermethylation of 14-3-3-sigma. Zhu
et al. (2007) concluded that IKKA protects the 14-3-3-sigma locus from
hypermethylation, which serves as a mechanism of maintaining genomic
stability in keratinocytes.

Mittal et al. (2006) found that the Yersinia YopJ virulence factor
inhibited the host inflammatory response and induced apoptosis of immune
cells by catalyzing acetylation of 2 ser residues in the activation loop
of MEK2 (MAP2K2; 601263), thereby blocking MEK2 activation and signal
propagation. YopJ also caused acetylation of a thr residue in the
activation loop of both IKKA and IKKB. Mittal et al. (2006) concluded
that ser/thr acetylation is a mode of action for bacterial toxins that
may also occur under nonpathogenic conditions to regulate protein
function.

Luo et al. (2007) examined IKK-alpha involvement in prostate cancer (see
176807) and its progression. They demonstrated that a mutation that
prevents IKK-alpha activation slowed down prostate cancer growth and
inhibited metastatogenesis in TRAMP mice, which express SV40 T antigen
in the prostate epithelium. Decreased metastasis correlated with
elevated expression of the metastasis suppressor Maspin (154790), the
ablation of which restored metastatic activity. IKK-alpha activation by
RANK ligand (RANKL; 602642) inhibited Maspin expression in prostate
epithelial cells, whereas repression of Maspin transcription required
nuclear translocation of active IKK-alpha. The amount of active nuclear
IKK-alpha in mouse and human prostate cancer correlated with metastatic
progression, reduced Maspin expression, and infiltration of prostate
tumors with RANKL-expressing inflammatory cells. Luo et al. (2007)
proposed that tumor-infiltrating RANKL-expressing cells leads to nuclear
IKK-alpha activation and inhibition of Maspin transcription, thereby
promoting the metastatic phenotype.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lahtela et al. (2010) detected 21 exons in the CHUK gene.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analyses, Mock et al. (1995) mapped the CHUK gene
to 10q24-q25. By a combination of somatic cell hybrid, recombinant
inbred, and backcross analyses, they mapped Chuk and a related sequence,
Chuk-rs1, to mouse chromosomes 19 and 16, respectively.

By FISH, Hu and Wang (1998) mapped the CHUK gene to chromosome 10q24.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Lahtela et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for a nonsense mutation
(600664.0001) in 2 fetuses from 1 family with autosomal recessive cocoon
syndrome (613630).

ANIMAL MODEL

Takeda et al. (1999) disrupted the Ikka gene in mice. Ikka -/- mice died
within 4 hours of birth. They had abnormal limb and craniofacial
development despite normal skeletal development. The skin appeared
abnormally shiny. The epidermal cells of Ikka-deficient mouse fetuses
were highly proliferative with dysregulated epidermal differentiation.
In the basal layer of the epidermis, degradation of I-kappa-B and
nuclear localization of NFKB were not observed. Thus, Ikka is essential
for NFKB activation in the limb and skin during embryogenesis.
Surprisingly, there was no impairment of NFKB activation in response to
either TNF-alpha or IL1 in Ikka-deficient embryonic fibroblasts or
thymocytes, indicating that Ikka is not essential for cytokine-induced
activation of NFKB.

Hu et al. (1999) generated Ikka-deficient mice. Homozygous mutant mice
died within 30 minutes of birth. At embryonic day 18, Ikka -/- mice had
rudimentary protrusions instead of normal limbs. They lacked well-formed
tails and their heads were shorter than normal, with a truncated snout
and no external ears. They had an omphalocele and taut skin. At autopsy,
there were no morphologic abnormalities of heart, lung, liver, kidneys,
spleen, brain, and spinal cord; however, the placentae were severely
congested with bulging vessels and blood sinuses on the maternal surface
and normal fetal surface. Skeletal preparations revealed fused sacral
and cervical vertebrae and a short sternum with delayed ossification and
split xiphoid. Microscopic examination of the skin revealed hyperplasia
of the stratum spinosum, and mutant epidermis lacked a stratum
granulosum and stratum corneum. The lack of Ikka appeared to completely
disrupt keratinocyte differentiation. Hu et al. (1999) hypothesized that
the increased thickness and adhesiveness of mutant skin prevented the
emergence of limb outgrowths.

Yoshida et al. (2000) examined wildtype and Ikka -/- mice on embryonic
days 18 and 19 by light and electron microscopy or immunocytochemistry.
During normal development of the conjunctiva and cornea, nuclear
localization of NFKB1 p50 was seen in areas where basal undifferentiated
cells give rise to differentiated cell types. However, in the Ikka -/-
tissues, no nuclear p50 staining was detected. The authors concluded
that IKKA is specifically required for formation of cornea and
conjunctiva. They stated that this function might be exerted through an
effect on NFKB activity.

Using an ex vivo mouse keratinocyte culture system, immunofluorescence
microscopy, and Western blot analysis, Hu et al. (2001) showed that
keratinocytes derived from Ikka-deficient mice exhibit a
hyperproliferative phenotype, fail to undergo terminal differentiation,
and do not express the appropriate differentiation markers, loricrin
(152445) and filaggrin (135940). This phenotype was observed in the
absence of a defect in NFKB activation. Introduction of Ikka into Ikka
-/- keratinocytes restores keratinocyte differentiation and filaggrin
expression. Mutation and immunoblot analysis established that induction
of keratinocyte differentiation does not require the protein kinase
activity of Ikka. Fetal Ikka -/- skin transplanted to immunodeficient
mice differentiated normally and expressed proliferation and
differentiation markers including Pcna (176740), Krt5 (148040), Krt1
(139350), and filaggrin, suggesting that normal skin contains a factor
that induces terminal differentiation of Ikka-deficient keratinocytes.
The authors demonstrated that wildtype keratinocytes produce,
independently of NFKB activation, a keratinocyte
differentiation-inducing factor (kDIF) protein. Hu et al. (2001)
concluded that the defect in Ikka -/- keratinocytes is continuous
proliferation even in the presence of growth-inhibiting levels of
extracellular calcium. Although Ikka is replaceable by, and is less
efficient than, Ikkb for activating NFKB, it is essential for normal
epidermal development.

By radiation chimera and flow cytometric analyses, Senftleben et al.
(2001) found reduced levels of mature B lymphocytes in spleen and lymph
nodes correlated with high turnover and apoptosis rates in immature B
cells in Ikka -/- reconstituted mice. In vivo, the spleens of chimeric
animals exhibited poor germinal center formation in response to
immunization. Immunoblot and electrophoretic mobility shift analyses
showed that Ikka -/- B cells contained little p52 and increased amounts
of p100, indicative of defective processing of NFKB2. Viable mice
carrying mutations in the activating phosphorylation sites of Ikka
(ser176 to ala and ser180 to ala) expressed a similar, sometimes more
severe, phenotype, suggesting a requirement for the phosphorylation of
these residues either by Ikka itself or by NIK. Recombinant Ikka was
much more efficient than Ikkb or NIK in phosphorylation of the
C-terminal regulatory domain of NFKB2, whereas it was less efficient in
the phosphorylation of IKBA. Senftleben et al. (2001) proposed that
defective NFKB2 processing likely interferes with B-cell maturation.
They concluded that IKKA is required for the activation of NFKB2, which
leads to B-cell maturation and germinal center formation.

Matsushima et al. (2001) found that both Nik -/- and Ikka -/- mice had
impaired NFKB activation in response to lymphotoxin B receptor (600979)
stimulation but not TNF receptor-1 (191190) stimulation. These mice also
had defective development of Peyer patches.

Cao et al. (2001) generated an Ikka(AA) knockin allele containing
alanines instead of serines in the activation loop. Ikka(AA/AA) mice
were healthy and fertile, but females displayed a severe lactation
defect due to impaired proliferation of mammary epithelial cells. Ikka
activity was required for NFKB activation in mammary epithelial cells
during pregnancy and in response to RANK ligand but not TNF. Ikka and
NFKB activation were also required for optimal cyclin D1 (168461)
induction. Defective RANK signaling or cyclin D1 expression resulted in
the same phenotypic effect as the Ikka(AA) mutation, which could be
completely suppressed by a mammary-specific cyclin D1 transgene. Thus,
IKKA is a critical intermediate in a pathway that controls mammary
epithelial proliferation in response to RANK signaling via cyclin D1.

Sil et al. (2004) postulated that the morphogenetic defects in
Ikk-alpha-deficient mice are not caused by reduced NF-kappa-B activity
but instead are due to failed epidermal differentiation that disrupts
proper epidermal-mesodermal interactions. Sil et al. (2004) tested this
hypothesis by introducing an epidermal-specific Ikka transgene into
Ikk-alpha-deficient mice. Mice lacking Ikk-alpha in all cell types
including bone and cartilage, but not in basal epidermal keratinocytes,
exhibit normal epidermal differentiation and skeletal morphology. Thus,
epidermal differentiation is required for proper morphogenesis of
mesodermally derived skeletal elements. One way by which IKK-alpha
controls skeletal and craniofacial morphogenesis is by repressing
expression of fibroblast growth factor family members, such as FGF8
(600483), whose expression is specifically elevated in the limb bud
ectoderm of Ikk-alpha-deficient mice.

Ohazama et al. (2004) determined that Ikka is expressed in mouse tooth
epithelium and has an essential role in incisor and molar tooth
development. Molar teeth in Ikka mutant mice had abnormal cusp
morphology due to a reduction of the Nfkb pathway. Incisors, however,
had a more severe and earlier phenotype where tooth buds failed to
invaginate into the underlying mesenchyme but instead evaginated into
the developing oral cavity. A similar evagination of epithelium was also
observed in whisker follicles. Unlike cusp morphogenesis, the Nfkb
pathway was not involved in the invagination of incisor tooth
epithelium. Changes in the expression of Notch1 (190198), Notch2
(600275), Wnt7b (601967), and Shh (600725) in incisor epithelium of Ikka
mutants suggested that the Nfkb-independent function is mediated by
Notch/Wnt/Shh signaling pathways.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
COCOON SYNDROME
CHUK, GLN422TER

In 2 fetuses with cocoon syndrome (613630) from a Finnish family,
Lahtela et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for a C-to-T transition at
nucleotide 1264 in exon 12 of the CHUK gene, resulting in a glu-to-stop
substitution at codon 422 (E422X). This mutation was identified in
heterozygosity in both of the carrier parents and was not identified in
any of 100 ancestrally-matched control subjects. Fibroblast DNA from the
affected fetuses had no CHUK protein expression.

603809	TITLE *603809 THYROID HORMONE RECEPTOR-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 3; THRAP3
;;THYROID HORMONE RECEPTOR-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN, 150-KD; TRAP150
DESCRIPTION For background information on thyroid hormone receptor-associated
proteins (TRAPs), see 300182.

Using a HeLa cell line, Ito et al. (1999) cloned TRAP150, the gene
encoding the 150-kD subunit of the TRAP complex. The TRAP150 cDNA
encodes a 955-amino acid protein with no obvious known sequence motifs.
Sequence comparisons revealed a gene of unknown function, designated
KIAA0164 by Nagase et al. (1996), that encodes a related human protein
(overall identity of 40% and similarity of 55%), thus indicating a
putative gene family. Northern blot analysis of multiple human tissues
showed that the TRAP150 gene is ubiquitously expressed as an
approximately 5.0-kb transcript.

;;ASC1 COMPLEX, 50-KD SUBUNIT;;
p50
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing peptides that copurified with the 650-kD ASC1 (TRIP4;
604501) complex from HeLa cells, followed by database analysis and PCR
of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Jung et al. (2002) cloned ASCC1, which they
designated p50. The deduced 357-amino acid protein contains a KH-type
RNA-binding motif near its N terminus. Northern blot analysis detected
variable expression of an approximately 2.1-kb transcript in all tissues
examined. P50 localized to both nuclei and cytoplasm of HeLa cells.
Database analysis revealed orthologs of p50 in mouse, fly, frog, and
nematode.

GENE FUNCTION

Jung et al. (2002) identified a 650-kD protein complex containing ASC1,
p50, p100 (ASCC2; 614216), and p200 (ASCC3; 614217). Immunodepletion of
p50 from HeLa cell nuclear extracts almost completely eliminated phorbol
ester-induced AP1 (see 165160) transactivation of a reporter gene. Yeast
2-hybrid analysis, coimmunoprecipitation of in vitro-translated
proteins, and protein pull-down experiments confirmed direct interaction
between p50 and p200. Domain analysis revealed that the KH motif of p50
was required its interaction with p200.

Gastrin (GAS; 137250) regulates the expression of a variety of genes
involved in the control of acid secretion. It also triggers tissue
response to damage, infection, and inflammation in cells expressing
gastrin receptor (CCKBR; 118445) and, indirectly, in nearby cells via a
paracrine mechanism. Almeida-Vega et al. (2009) found that gastrin
directly induced upregulation of the antiapoptotic regulator PAI2
(SERPINB2; 173390) in CCKBR-positive cells. CCKBR-positive cells also
released IL8 (146930) and prostaglandin E2 into the culture medium in
response to gastrin, which resulted in elevated PAI2 expression in
cocultured CCKBR-negative cells. IL8 signaling in CCKBR-negative cells
upregulated PAI2 via binding of the ASC1 complex to the PAI2 promoter.
Prostaglandin E2 independently upregulated PAI2 via RHOA
(165390)-dependent signaling that induced binding of MAZ (600999) to the
PAI2 promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin
immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that MAZ and the p50 subunit of
the ASC1 complex bound directly to sites in the PAI2 promoter. Mutation
of the putative MAZ site in the PAI2 promoter reduced responses to RHOA.
Knockdown of the p50 or p65 (TRIP4) subunits of the ASC1 complex via
small interfering RNA significantly reduced PAI2 upregulation in
response to gastrin.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the ASCC1 gene to chromosome 10q22.1 based on an
alignment of the ASCC1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF132952) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Orloff et al. (2011) identified a germline asn290-to-ser (N290S;
614215.0001) mutation in the ASCC1 gene in 2 (2.1%) of 116 patients of
European descent with Barrett esophagus and/or esophageal adenocarcinoma
(614266). The mutation was not found in 125 controls. This genomic
region was studied after being identified by genomewide linkage analysis
of 21 concordant and 11 discordant sib pairs with the disorders.

GLC1E GENE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Li et al. (1998) used the adenovirus E3-14.7K protein to screen a HeLa
cell cDNA library to search for interacting proteins in the yeast
2-hybrid system. They identified a protein, which they named FIP2
(14.7K-interacting protein) with multiple leucine zipper domains. Li et
al. (1998) identified 3 major mRNA forms of FIP2 in multiple human
tissues and found that expression of the transcripts was induced by
TNF-alpha (191160) treatment in a time-dependent manner in 2 different
cell lines. They concluded that FIP2 is one of the cellular targets for
adenovirus E3-14.7K and that its mechanism of affecting cell death
involves the TNF receptor (191190), RIP (603453), or a downstream
molecule affected by either of these 2 molecules.

Moreland et al. (2000) cloned the same gene, which they called
transcription factor IIIA-interacting protein. The rat TF3A-intP has 85%
identity with the human sequence, including 100% identity over a
leucine-rich, 36-amino acid stretch. The full-length 617-amino acid
protein has a molecular mass of 70.6 kD, numerous leucine zippers and
other leucine-rich regions, and contains a potential cys2-his-cys zinc
finger at residues 553-582.

Schwamborn et al. (2000) also cloned the optineurin gene, which they
called NRP (NEMO-related protein), by searching databases for cDNAs with
strong homology to NEMO (300248). They determined that NRP is a 67-kD
protein with 53% amino acid identity to NEMO and that it is present in a
novel high molecular weight complex that contains none of the known
members of the IKK complex. They demonstrated that de novo expression of
NRP can be induced by interferon and TNF-alpha and that these 2 stimuli
have a synergistic effect on NRP expression. They further demonstrated
that NRP is associated with the Golgi apparatus.

Li et al. (1998) found gene expression of FIP2 in heart, brain,
placenta, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas. By RT-PCR,
Rezaie et al. (2002) found further expression in human trabecular
meshwork, nonpigmented ciliary epithelium, retina, brain, adrenal
cortex, liver, fetus, lymphocyte, and fibroblast. Northern blot analysis
revealed a major 2.0-kb transcript in human trabecular meshwork and
nonpigmented ciliary epithelium and a minor 3.6-kb message that was 3 to
4 times less abundant. Optineurin expression was also detected in
aqueous humor samples of human, macaque, cow, pig, goat, sheep, cat, and
rabbit, suggesting that it is a secreted protein. Rezaie et al. (2002)
showed by immunocytochemistry that optineurin is localized to the Golgi
apparatus.

Wild et al. (2011) reported that the 577-amino acid human OPTN protein
contains an N-terminal coiled-coil domain, followed by an LC3 (MAP1LC3A;
601242)-interacting motif (LIR), 2 more coiled-coil domains, a
ubiquitin-binding motif (UBAN), and a C-terminal zinc finger domain.

GENE FUNCTION

Optineurin has been shown to interact with huntingtin (HTT; 613004)
(Faber et al., 1998), transcription factor IIIA (Moreland et al., 2000),
and RAB8 (165040) (Hattula and Peranen, 2000).

Rezaie et al. (2002) found that the optineurin gene is mutated in
adult-onset primary open angle glaucoma (POAG; 137760). Linkage analysis
had shown that a locus for POAG resided on chromosome 10p15-p14
(Sarfarazi et al., 1998). Optineurin was a logical candidate gene on the
basis of its physical location on chromosome 10 and its expression in
retina.

Vittitow and Borras (2002) studied the effect of glaucomatous insults on
the expression of OPTN in human eyes maintained in organ culture.
Sustained elevated intraocular pressure, TNF-alpha exposure, and
prolonged dexamethasone treatment all significantly upregulated OPTN
expression. Vittitow and Borras (2002) concluded that these results
support the protective role of OPTN in the trabecular meshwork.

Chalasani et al. (2007) explored functional features of optineurin and
its mutants. The E50K mutation (602432.0001) acquired the ability to
induce cell death selectively in retinal ganglion cells. This cell death
was mediated by oxidative stress.

Park et al. (2007) studied the relationship between 2 glaucoma-related
genes, OPTN and MYOC (601652). MYOC overexpression had no effect on OPTN
expression, but OPTN overexpression upregulated endogenous MYOC in human
trabecular meshwork cells. This induction was also observed in other
ocular and nonocular cell types, including rat PC12 pheochromocytoma
cells. Endogenous levels of both Optn and Myoc were increased in PC12
cells following NGF (see 162030)-induced neuronal differentiation.
Overexpressed OPTN, which localized to the cytoplasm, prolonged the
turnover rate of MYOC mRNA, but it had little effect on MYOC promoter
activity. Park et al. (2007) concluded that OPTN has a role in
stabilizing MYOC mRNA.

Li et al. (2008) showed that TNF-alpha, which is found in cystic fluid
of humans with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD; see
173900), disrupted the localization of polycystin-2 (PKD2; 173910) to
the plasma membrane and primary cilia through the TNF-alpha-induced
scaffold protein FIP2. Treatment of mouse embryonic kidney organ
cultures with TNF-alpha resulted in cyst formation, and this effect was
exacerbated in Pkd2 +/- kidneys. TNF-alpha also stimulated cyst
formation in vivo in Pkd2 +/- mice, and treatment of Pkd2 +/- mice with
a TNF-alpha inhibitor prevented cyst formation.

Using yeast 2-hybrid screens, Morton et al. (2008) identified TANK
(603893)-binding kinase-1 (TBK1; 604834) as a binding partner for
optineurin; the interaction was confirmed by
overexpression/immunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293 cells and by
coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous OPTN and TBK1 from cell extracts. A
TBK1-binding site was detected between residues 1 and 127 of optineurin;
residues 78 through 121 were found to display striking homology to the
TBK1-binding domain of TANK. The OPTN-binding domain was localized to
residues 601 to 729 of TBK1; residues 1 to 688 of TBK1, which do not
bind to TANK, did not interact with OPTN. The E50K OPTN mutant
(602432.0001), known to cause open angle glaucoma (GLC1E; 137760),
displayed markedly enhanced binding to TBK1, suggesting that this
interaction may contribute to familial glaucoma caused by this mutation.

Wild et al. (2011) reported that phosphorylation of human OPTN promoted
selective autophagy of ubiquitin-coated cytosolic Salmonella enterica.
Phosphorylation on ser177 by TBK1 (604834) enhanced LC3 binding affinity
and autophagic clearance of cytosolic Salmonella. On the other hand,
ubiquitin- or LC3-binding mutants of OPTN or silencing of OPTN or TBK1
impaired Salmonella autophagy, leading to increased intracellular
bacterial proliferation. Wild et al. (2011) proposed that
phosphorylation of autophagy receptors, such as OPTN, may be a general
mechanism for regulation of cargo-selective autophagy.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rezaie et al. (2002) reported that the optineurin gene contains 3
noncoding exons in the 5-prime untranslated region and 13 exons that
code for a 577-amino acid protein. Alternative splicing at the 5-prime
UTR generates at least 3 different isoforms, but all have the same
reading frame. The mouse Optn gene codes for a 584-amino acid protein
(67 kD) that has 78% identity with human optineurin.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the OPTN
gene to chromosome 10 (TMAP stSG3281).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Primary Open Angle Glaucoma

In patients with adult-onset primary open angle glaucoma (GLC1E;
137760), Rezaie et al. (2002) identified heterozygous mutations in the
OPTN gene (602432.0001-602432.0004). One of the mutations (602432.0004)
was also found to be associated with normal tension glaucoma
(602432.0004).

Because normal tension glaucoma (NTG) is the most frequent form of
glaucoma in Japan, Tang et al. (2003) sought mutations in the OPTN gene
in 148 unrelated Japanese patients with NTG as well as 165 patients with
POAG and 196 unrelated controls without glaucoma. No disease-causing
mutations were identified in these individuals.

Funayama et al. (2004) demonstrated that the OPTN gene was associated
with POAG rather than NTG in Japanese. Their statistical analyses showed
a possible interaction between polymorphisms in the OPTN and the tumor
necrosis factor-alpha (TNF; 191160) genes that would increase the risk
for the development and probably the progression of glaucoma in Japanese
patients with POAG.

- Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis

Maruyama et al. (2010) identified 2 different homozygous null mutations
in the OPTN gene, one a deletion of exon 5 (602432.0005) and the other a
nonsense mutation (602432.0006) in 4 Japanese individuals with autosomal
recessive amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS12; 613435). These mutations
were not identified in over 6,800 individuals with glaucoma. In
addition, Maruyama et al. (2010) identified a missense mutation, E478G
(602432.0007), segregating as an apparently autosomal dominant mutation
with incomplete penetrance in 2 families. This mutation was not seen in
a total of 5,000 Japanese chromosomes. In cell transfection assays,
Maruyama et al. (2010) observed that nonsense and missense mutations of
OPTN abolished the inhibition of activation of nuclear factor kappa-B
(NFKB; see 164011) and that E478G mutant OPTN had a cytoplasmic
distribution different from that of wildtype OPTN or OPTN carrying a
mutation causing in POAG. A case with the E478G mutation showed
OPTN-immunoreactive cytoplasmic inclusions. Furthermore, TDP43 (605078)-
or SOD1 (147450)-positive inclusions in sporadic and familial cases of
ALS were also noticeably immunolabeled by anti-OPTN antibodies.

Deng et al. (2011) observed OPTN-immunoreactive skeinlike inclusions in
anterior horn neurons and neurites in spinal cord sections from all 32
patients with sporadic ALS and in all 8 patients with familial ALS who
did not have mutations in the SOD1 gene. OPTN immunoreactivity was
absent in all 6 cases of familial ALS due to SOD1 mutations and in
tissue from 2 mouse models of ALS due to Sod1 mutations. The findings
suggested that OPTN may play a role in the pathogenesis of non-SOD1 ALS,
and that SOD1-linked ALS has a distinct disease pathogenesis.

- Paget Disease of Bone

For discussion of a possible association of variation in the OPTN gene
with susceptibility to Paget disease of bone, see 602080.

ANIMAL MODEL

Chi et al. (2010) described the phenotypic characteristics of transgenic
mice overexpressing wildtype or mutated optineurin. Mutations E50K
(602432.0001), H486R, and Optn with a deletion of the first or second
leucine zipper were used for overexpression. After 16 months, histologic
abnormalities were exclusively observed in the retina of E50K mutant
mice, with loss of retinal ganglion cells and connecting synapses in the
peripheral retina, thinning of the nerve fiber layer at the optic nerve
head at normal intraocular pressure, and massive apoptosis and
degeneration of the entire retina. Introduction of the E50K mutation
disrupted the interaction between Optn and Rab8 GTPase (RAB8A; 165040),
a protein involved in the regulation of vesicle transport from Golgi to
plasma membrane. Wiltype Optn and an active GTP-bound form of Rab8
colocalized to the Golgi. Chi et al. (2010) concluded that alteration of
the Optn sequence can initiate significant retinal degeneration in mice.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
GLAUCOMA 1, OPEN ANGLE, E
OPTN, GLU50LYS

In affected members of a family segregating adult-onset open angle
glaucoma (137760), Rezaie et al. (2002) identified a 458G-A transition
in the OPTN gene, resulting in a glu50-to-lys substitution. This
mutation was observed in 7 of 52 families, accounting for 13.5% of the
disease-causing alterations, and was not identified in any of 540 normal
chromosomes tested.

Rezaie et al. (2002) noted that 31 (81.6%) of the 38 glaucoma patients
carrying the recurrent E50K mutation had normal intraocular pressure
(IOP), ranging from 11 to 21 mm Hg, whereas the remaining 7 patients had
elevated IOP (23 to 26 mm Hg).

OPTN, 2-BP INS, 691AG

In 1 of 46 families segregating adult-onset primary open angle glaucoma
(137760), Rezaie et al. (2002) identified a frameshift mutation in exon
6 of the OPTN gene, an insertion of AG between nucleotides 691 and 692.
This mutation was observed in 2.2% of the families studied and was not
seen in any of 200 normal chromosomes tested.

16 of the OPTN gene, resulting in an arg545-to-glu substitution. This
mutation was not identified in any of 100 normal chromosomes tested.

Within a group of 169 subjects with adult-onset open angle glaucoma
(137760), Rezaie et al. (2002) identified a 603T-A transversion in exon
5 of the OPTN gene, resulting in a met98-to-lys substitution in 8 of 45
familial (17.8%) and 15 of 124 (12.1%) sporadic individuals with
glaucoma. Most of these individuals had normal intraocular pressure
(606657) and were screened for sequence changes in exon 5 only. This
mutation was also identified in 9 of 422 normal chromosomes, giving the
overall identification in an at-risk population of 13.6% versus 2.1% in
the general population, and making this a risk-associated alteration.

AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS 12
OPTN, DEL EXON 5

In 2 sibs with autosomal recessive ALS (ALS12; 613435) from a
consanguineous Japanese family, Maruyama et al. (2010) identified
homozygosity for deletion of exon 5 of the OPTN gene. The deletion
resulted from an Alu-mediated recombination.

.0006
AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS 12
OPTN, GLN398TER

In a Japanese woman with ALS (ALS12; 613435) who was the child of a
consanguineous union, Maruyama et al. (2010) identified a homozygosity
for a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 1502 of the OPTN gene, resulting
in a glutamine-to-nonsense substitution at codon 398 (Q398X). In a
separate analysis, Maruyama et al. (2010) found this mutation in
homozygosity in an apparently sporadic case. The probands of the 2
families were not related according to their family history but were
found to share haplotypes for a 0.9-Mb region around the OPTN gene,
suggesting that inheritance of the mutation from a common ancestor was
likely. This mutation was not detected in 781 healthy Japanese
volunteers as well as in over 6,800 individuals enrolled in glaucoma
studies, where the entire coding region of the gene was sequenced.

.0007
AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS 12
OPTN, GLU478GLY

In 4 individuals with ALS (ALS12; 613435) from 2 families, Maruyama et
al. (2010) identified a heterozygous missense mutation in the OPTN gene,
an A-to-G transition at nucleotide 1743 in exon 14 resulting in a
glutamic acid-to-glycine substitution at codon 478 (E478G). Two of the
subjects were sisters, and the pedigree suggested that the mutation
resulted in an autosomal dominant trait with incomplete penetrance. In
the second family, the sibs were brothers. Although the 2 families were
not known to be related, all affected individuals shared their haplotype
for 2.3 megabases on chromosome 10 around the OPTN gene.

603069	TITLE *603069 DUAL-SPECIFICITY PHOSPHATASE 5; DUSP5
;;VH1-LIKE PHOSPHATASE 3; HVH3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) constitute a large heterogeneous
subgroup of the type I cysteine-based protein-tyrosine phosphatase
superfamily. DUSPs are characterized by their ability to dephosphorylate
both tyrosine and serine/threonine residues. DUSP1 belongs to a class of
DUSPs, designated MKPs, that dephosphorylate MAPK (mitogen-activated
protein kinase) proteins ERK (see 601795), JNK (see 601158), and p38
(see 600289) with specificity distinct from that of individual MKP
proteins. MKPs contain a highly conserved C-terminal catalytic domain
and an N-terminal Cdc25 (see 116947)-like (CH2) domain. MAPK activation
cascades mediate various physiologic processes, including cellular
proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and stress responses (summary
by Patterson et al., 2009).

CLONING

To identify human dual-specificity PTPases, Martell et al. (1994)
screened a genomic library with a partial DUSP1 (600714) cDNA. They
isolated several novel PTPase genes, including DUSP5, which they
designated HVH3 for human VH1-like PTPase-3.

Kwak and Dixon (1995) cloned human placenta DUSP5 cDNAs and reported
that the predicted protein has 384 amino acids. Using
immunofluorescence, they determined that epitope-tagged DUSP5 is
localized primarily in the nucleus of mammalian cells.

Ishibashi et al. (1994) isolated DUSP5 cDNAs from a human mammary
epithelial cell cDNA library and found that the predicted protein has
397 amino acids. Northern blot analysis revealed that DUSP5 is expressed
as a 2.5-kb mRNA in a variety of tissues, with the highest levels in
pancreas and brain.

GENE FUNCTION

Ishibashi et al. (1994) found that, in vitro, recombinant protein
containing the catalytic domain of DUSP5 displayed phosphatase activity
toward several substrates. The highest relative activity was toward ERK1
(601795), suggesting that it may be a target for DUSP5 activity in vivo.
Ishibashi et al. (1994) showed that DUSP5 expression was induced by
serum stimulation of fibroblasts and by heat shock, with similar
kinetics to those observed with DUSP1. As has been proposed for other
dual-specificity PTPases like DUSP1 and DUSP2 (603068), Ishibashi et al.
(1994) suggested that the induction of DUSP5 may lead to the
deactivation of mitogen- or stress-activated protein kinases, thereby
restoring these signaling pathways to their mitogen- or stress-sensitive
state.

Using morpholino-mediated gene knockdown in zebrafish, Pramanik et al.
(2009) showed that Dusp5 and Snrk1 (SNRK; 612760) targeted a common
signaling pathway and coordinately functioned in controlling angioblast
numbers at the lateral plate mesoderm. Dusp5 was expressed in
angioblasts in embryonic zebrafish and was essential for vascular
development. Loss of Dusp5 resulted in endothelial cell apoptosis.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Martell et al. (1994) mapped the
DUSP5 gene to 10q25.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Somatic Mutations

Pramanik et al. (2009) identified an apparently somatic ser147-to-pro
(S147P) mutation in the DUSP5 gene in 1 of 3 infantile hemangioma
(602089) samples and in 12 of 17 lymphatic, arteriovenous, and venous
malformation samples. The mutation was not found in normal human
placenta, control human umbilical vein endothelial cells, or tonsillar
tissue from unrelated individuals. In addition, a somatic arg248-to-gln
(R248Q) mutation in the SNRK gene was found in 8 of the vascular anomaly
samples, including venous and lymphatic malformations, but not in
infantile hemangiomas. Six of the 8 samples with the SNRK mutation also
carried the DUSP5 S147P mutation. Since studies in zebrafish implicated
a role for the Dusp5/Snrk signaling pathway in vascular development, the
findings suggested that variation in these genes may provide
susceptibility to the development of vascular anomalies in humans.

610972	TITLE *610972 ADHERENS JUNCTION-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1; AJAP1
;;SHREW1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using differential display RT-PCR to identify cDNAs specific to invasive
versus noninvasive derivatives of an endometriotic cell line, followed
by database analysis and 5-prime and 3-prime RACE of a brain cDNA
library, Bharti et al. (2004) cloned AJAP1, which they called SHREW1.
The predicted 411-amino acid protein is highly alkaline and has a
calculated molecular mass of 43 kD. It contains an N-terminal signal
peptide, a transmembrane domain, and potential sites for
phosphorylation, glycosylation, and myristoylation. Database analysis
suggested that SHREW1 may be restricted to vertebrates. Northern blot
analysis of invasive endometriotic cells detected a 4-kb SHREW1
transcript. Immunoblot analysis of human pancreas and uterus revealed an
endogenous 48-kD SHREW1 protein. Epitope-tagged SHREW1 localized to the
basolateral membrane of polarized epithelial cells and colocalized with
E-cadherin (CDH1; 192090), a marker of adherens junctions.

GENE FUNCTION

Schreiner et al. (2007) found that overexpression of SHREW1 protein
enhanced invasiveness of human fibrosarcoma cells. SHREW1 interacted
with CD147 (BSG; 109480), a mediator of invasiveness and matrix
metalloprotease activity, in epithelial cells. Downregulation of SHREW1
or CD147 using small interfering RNA in HeLa cells decreased
invasiveness without affecting proliferation. Schreiner et al. (2007)
concluded that SHREW1-CD147 interaction is associated with regulation of
cellular invasion.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the AJAP1
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP SGC32361).

TMA OXYGENASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The flavin-containing monooxygenases (EC 1.14.13.8) are microsomal
enzymes that catalyze the NADPH-dependent oxygenation of a large number
of structurally diverse foreign compounds including many therapeutic
drugs and pesticides. FMO3 is the largest of the FMO proteins (Phillips
et al., 1995).

CLONING

Dolphin et al. (1992) cloned the human FMO4 gene, which they called
FMO2, by screening an adult human liver library with the porcine coding
sequence. The cDNA encodes a deduced 558-amino acid protein with a
molecular mass of 63,338 Da. FMO2 shows 51 to 53% primary sequence
identity with FMO1 (136130). The corresponding mRNA was present in low
abundance in adult human liver. Southern blot hybridization with single
exon probes demonstrated that human FMO4 and FMO1 are, in each case, the
product of a single gene.

MAPPING

By PCR analysis, Dolphin et al. (1992) mapped the FMO4 gene to
chromosome 1.

NOMENCLATURE

Lawton et al. (1994) proposed a reclassification of mammalian FMOs.
Under this system, FMO2 described by Dolphin et al. (1992) is now
designated FMO4.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The high affinity IgE receptor is responsible for initiating the
allergic response. Binding of allergen to receptor-bound IgE leads to
cell activation and the release of mediators (such as histamine)
responsible for the manifestations of allergy. The receptor is a
tetrameric complex composed of an alpha chain (147140), a beta chain,
and 2 disulfide-linked gamma chains (147139). It is found on the surface
of mast cells and basophils. The alpha and beta subunits have not been
detected in other hematopoietic cells, although the gamma chains are
found in macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, and T cells where they
associate with the low affinity receptor for IgG or with the T-cell
antigen receptor. The molecular cloning of subunits permitted the
reconstitution of surface-expressed receptor complexes by transfection.
Cotransfection of all 3 chains--alpha, beta, and gamma--was required for
efficient surface expression of the rat or mouse receptor. By contrast,
surface expression of the human alpha-gamma complex was achieved by
cotransfecting alpha and gamma alone, suggesting that beta is not
necessary. To study the expression of the beta gene, Kuster et al.
(1992) isolated and characterized the gene and its cDNA. Analysis of the
surface expression of transfected receptors indicated that human
alpha-gamma and alpha-beta-gamma complexes are expressed with comparable
efficiency.

Donnadieu et al. (2003) noted that the FCER1 tetrameric complex is
expressed on mast cells and basophils, whereas the FCER1 trimeric
complex lacking the beta subunit is expressed on Langerhan cells,
dendritic cells, and monocytes. Thus, beta chain expression correlates
with allergy mediator release, while the trimeric FCER1 form is
associated with antigen presentation. The presence of the beta chain
amplifies FCER1 surface expression and signaling capacity, and the beta
chain acts as a chaperone for transporting the FCER1 complex to the cell
surface. By RT-PCR of basophil RNA, Donnadieu et al. (2003) cloned an
FCER1B splice variant that retains intron 5 and encodes a truncated
protein, designated beta(T). The fourth transmembrane domain and the
C-terminal tail of the full-length beta form are deleted and replaced
with 16 novel amino acids in beta(T). The beta(T) variant was also
present in cord blood mast cells, but not in a monocyte cell line.
Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses showed that beta(T) was
expressed as a 21-kD protein, whereas the full-length form was 28 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Using transfection experiments, Donnadieu et al. (2003) showed that the
beta(T) isoform competed with the full-length beta isoform and
diminished FCER1 expression by preventing alpha chain maturation.
Immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that beta(T) associated with
immature alpha chains, but not with mature alpha chains or gamma chains.
Donnadieu et al. (2003) proposed that the relative abundance of the beta
and beta(T) isoforms may control the level of surface FCER1 expression
and influence susceptibility to allergic disease.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kuster et al. (1992) determined that the gene encoding the human high
affinity IgE receptor beta chain spans about 10 kb and contains 7 exons.
There is a single transcription initiation site preceded by a TATA box.
The human beta gene appears to be present in single copy.

MAPPING

By linkage studies using a CA microsatellite repeat in the fifth intron
of the FCER1B gene, Sandford et al. (1993) demonstrated that the gene is
located on 11q13. Using in situ hybridization and pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis, Szepetowski and Gaudray (1994) likewise mapped the
FCER1B gene to chromosome 11q at a site centromeric from CD20 (112210)
at 11q13 and in the same 550 kb fragment as TCN1 (189905), thought to be
on 11q11-q12, and OSBP (167040), thought to be on 11q12-q13.

The gene for the mouse beta subunit was localized to chromosome 19 by
genetic linkage studies (Hupp et al., 1989) and was thought to be a
single gene. The genes for the alpha and gamma subunits are both located
on human and mouse chromosome 1 (Kuster et al., 1992).

- Linkage to Atopy

Sandford et al. (1993) demonstrated that the FCER1B gene is linked to
clinical atopy (147050). In their linkage study of atopy, Sandford et
al. (1993) used only maternally derived alleles; paternally derived
alleles failed to show linkage. The known roles of the high affinity IgE
receptor in antigen-induced mast cell degranulation and in the release
of cytokines that enhance IgE production, taken with the location in the
same region, 11q13, made the FCER1B gene a candidate for the chromosome
11 atopy locus.

Folster-Holst et al. (1998) presented evidence from linkage studies in
12 families with atopic dermatitis for linkage in close proximity to the
marker D11S903. The method of analysis suggested an oligogenic mode of
inheritance as well as heterogeneity in the genetic susceptibility to
atopy and atopic dermatitis; only 2 of 12 families showed evidence for
linkage using the oligogenic model.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Shirakawa et al. (1994) reported a significant association between atopy
and substitution of a leucine for an isoleucine at position 181 of the
FCER1B gene product. Hizawa et al. (1995) failed to find this
leu181-to-ile substitution.

Hill and Cookson (1996) identified a novel coding polymorphism in exon 7
of the beta subunit of the high affinity receptor for IgE. An A-to-G
transition changes glutamic acid-237 to glycine (147138.0001). The
substitution occurs adjacent to the immunoreceptor tyrosine activation
motif (ITAM). This E237G mutation was detected in 53 subjects from a
general Australian population of 1004 (5.3%). E237G subjects had a
significantly elevated skin test response to grass (p = 0.0004) and
house dust mite (p = 0.04), RAST to grass (p = 0.0020), and bronchial
reactivity to methacholine (p = 0.0009). Hill and Cookson (1996)
reported that the relative risk of individuals with E237G having asthma
compared to subjects without the variant was 2.3.

Traherne et al. (2003) performed association studies between FCER1B SNPs
and atopy in 2 Caucasian cohorts. Independent clusters of SNPs within an
18-kb region affected prick skin tests and specific IgE responses.
Interferon regulatory factor 2 (IRF2; 147576) sites were altered by
significantly associated SNPs in 2 regions. Strong association to
maternally derived alleles was seen in 1 panel of subjects and not in
the other. Two regions of increased CpG concentration were identified in
FCER1B, providing a potential substrate for epigenetic effects.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ATOPIC ASTHMA, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
MS4A2, GLU237GLY

Hill and Cookson (1996) found this exon 7 E237G polymorphism in 53 of
1004 Australian subjects studied (5.3%). E237G subjects had elevated
reactions to a number of common measures of atopy and bronchial
hyperresponsiveness. The investigators also found that the relative risk
for E237G individuals having asthma compared to those without the allele
was 2.3.

Shirakawa et al. (1996) reported that the gly237 form of the IgE Fc
receptor was associated with atopic asthma (odds ratio = 3.00,
chi-square = 5.10, p less than 0.03) and with elevated serum IgE levels
(odds ratio = 8.56) in the Japanese population. This association was
particularly noted in childhood asthma (odds ratio = 3.92, chi-square =
8.66, p less than 0.005).

Among 333 Japanese subjects, including 233 with nasal allergy and 100
controls, Nagata et al. (2001) observed a significant relationship
between gly237 and elevated levels of serum total IgE and very high IgE.
The findings suggested that the glu237-to-gly variant of the FCER1B gene
is involved in the development of nasal allergy through the process for
the production of both specific and nonspecific IgE antibodies.

;;CHAPERONIN CONTAINING TCP1, SUBUNIT 3;;
CCT-GAMMA; CCTG;;
TCP1 RING COMPLEX, POLYPEPTIDE 5; TRIC5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Molecular chaperones are proteins capable of folding or assembling
nascent proteins in a higher order structure. A molecular chaperone
called TCP1 ring complex (TRiC) plays a role in actin and tubulin
folding. TRiC is composed of 2 heteromeric subunits of 6 to 9 different
proteins. The cytoplasmic T-complex protein-1 (TCP1; 186980), an
abundant testicular germ cell protein, has been found in this complex.
Other components of TRiC, such as TRIC5, are TCP1-related proteins
(Sevigny et al., 1994).

CLONING

Joly et al. (1994) cloned a mouse cDNA corresponding to tryptic
fragments of the bovine TRiCP5 subunit described by Frydman et al.
(1992). The mouse TRiCP5 shares 48% nucleotide and 34% amino acid
homology with mouse Tcp1. It is a cytosolic protein also found in the
nuclear matrix of several cultured human cell lines. Furthermore, like
TCP1, it is highly expressed in testis.

Sevigny et al. (1994) cloned a partial human cDNA clone homologous to
mouse TRiCP5.

Walkley et al. (1996) cloned the human cDNA from a kidney library. The
1.9-kb cDNA encodes a predicted 544-amino acid protein that is 98%
similar to the mouse sequence and 75% similar to the yeast gene. The
mRNA is expressed in a variety of human tissues and at high levels in
mouse testis.

Sevigny et al. (1996) cloned the gene coding for the mouse P5 subunit.

GENE FUNCTION

Feldman et al. (1999) demonstrated that the folding and assembly of the
VHL protein (608537) into a complex with its partner proteins, elongin B
(600787) and elongin C (600788), is directly mediated by the chaperonin
TRiC. Their results defined a novel role for TRiC in mediating
oligomerization.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sevigny et al. (1996) determined that the mouse Tric5 gene contains 14
exons distributed within 25 kb of genomic DNA. Sevigny et al. (1996)
used primer extension to demonstrate multiple transcription start points
for the Tric5 gene. This was considered consistent with the lack of any
obvious TATA box upstream of the transcription start points.

MAPPING

Sevigny et al. (1994) mapped the TRIC5 gene to chromosome 1q23 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. The fact that the human TRIC5 gene
is not on chromosome 6 like other TCP1-related proteins implied to
Sevigny et al. (1994) that the genes coding the TCP1-related proteins
present in the TCP1 ring complex are probably not organized in a cluster
and thus are not synchronously regulated by a cis-acting control region
such as the LCR involved in the regulation of globin synthesis.

Sevigny et al. (1996) showed that the mouse genome contains 1 Tric5 gene
and 1 Tric5 pseudogene located on chromosomes 3F and 5B, respectively.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening a CD8+ T-lymphocyte cDNA library with a mouse lymphotactin
probe, Kennedy et al. (1995) isolated cDNAs encoding the lymphotactin
XCL1, later designated SCYC1. The sequence of the deduced 114-amino acid
protein is most homologous to the CC chemokines CCL8 (602283) and CCL3
(182283), but differs in that it lacks the first and third cysteines
characteristic of CC and CXC chemokines. By Northern blot analysis,
Kennedy et al. (1995) and Yoshida et al. (1995) revealed expression of
an 0.8-kb SCYC1 transcript in activated thymic and peripheral blood CD8+
but not CD4+ T cells. In normal tissues, SCYC1 is expressed at high
levels in spleen, thymus, small intestine, and peripheral blood
leukocytes, as well as at low levels in lung, prostate, and ovary; it
shows little or no expression in colon and testis. Lymphotactin is
chemotactic for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells but not for monocytes, and induces
a rise in intracellular calcium in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Yoshida
et al. (1995) and Muller et al. (1995) had identified the same sequence,
termed SCM1 and ATAC, respectively, homologous to mouse lymphotactin,
but were unable to demonstrate chemotaxis or calcium mobilization.

Kennedy et al. (1995) also identified a variant of SCYC1 which differed
from SCYC1 by only 2 amino acid residues. This variant was later found
to be a separate gene; see SCYC2 604828.

GENE FAMILY

Chemokines are a group of small (approximately 8 to 14 kD), mostly
basic, structurally related molecules that regulate cell trafficking of
various types of leukocytes through interactions with a subset of
7-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors (Kennedy et al., 1995).
Chemokines also play fundamental roles in the development, homeostasis,
and function of the immune system, and they have effects on cells of the
central nervous system as well as on endothelial cells involved in
angiogenesis or angiostasis. Chemokines are divided into 2 major
subfamilies, CXC and CC, based on the arrangement of the first 2 of the
4 conserved cysteine residues; the 2 cysteines are separated by a single
amino acid in CXC chemokines and are adjacent in CC chemokines.

GENE FUNCTION

Yoshida et al. (1998) observed that XCL1 induces the migration of cells
expressing XCR1 (600552).

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis, Yoshida et al. (1995) and Kennedy et
al. (1995) mapped the SCYC1 gene to chromosome 1. Kennedy et al. (1995)
noted that the region to which mouse lymphotactin was located on
chromosome 1 by Kelner et al. (1994) is syntenic to human 1q23-q25.
Yoshida et al. (1996) and Muller et al. (1995) mapped the gene to
chromosome 1q23 by FISH.

604515	TITLE *604515 B-CELL LINKER PROTEIN; BLNK
;;SH2 DOMAIN-CONTAINING LEUKOCYTE PROTEIN, 65-KD; SLP65;;
B CELL-SPECIFIC ADAPTOR PROTEIN; BASH
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The BLNK gene encodes a B-cell linker protein. Linker or adaptor
proteins provide mechanisms by which receptors can amplify and regulate
downstream effector proteins. BLNK is essential for normal B-cell
development (Fu et al., 1998).

CLONING

Fu et al. (1998) identified a novel B-cell linker protein, which they
called BLNK. BLNK encodes a 456-amino acid polypeptide with basic,
acidic, proline-rich, and SH2 domains. An alternatively spliced product
called BLNK-S lacks basepairs 760 to 828 within the proline-rich domain.
The murine Blnk protein shares 82% identity with human BLNK. There
appeared to be no alternatively spliced form of mouse BLNK. BLNK shows
greatest homology to the SLP76 (601603) linker protein. BLNK mRNA is
predominantly expressed in the spleen, although some level of expression
can be seen in liver, kidney, and pancreas. Expression of BLNK proteins
was detected only in B-cell lines.

Wienands et al. (1998) independently cloned BLNK, which they called
SLP65.

GENE FUNCTION

Fu et al. (1998) showed that BLNK interfaces the B-cell receptor
(BCR)-associated SYK tyrosine kinase (600085) with PLC-gamma (172420),
the VAV guanine nucleotide exchange factor (164875), and the GRB2
(108355) and NCK (600508) adaptor proteins. Tyrosine phosphorylation of
BLNK by SYK provides docking sites for these SH2-containing effector
molecules that, in turn, permits the phosphorylation and/or activation
of their respective signaling pathways. Thus, BLNK represents a central
linker protein that bridges the B-cell receptor-associated kinases with
a multitude of signaling pathways and may regulate biologic outcomes of
B-cell function and development.

Ishiai et al. (1999) demonstrated that BLNK is essential in activating
phospholipase C (PLC)-gamma-2 (PLCG2; 600220) and JNK (601158). The
BCR-induced PLC-gamma-2 activation, but not the JNK activation, was
restored by introduction of a membrane-associated form of PLC-gamma-2
into BLNK-deficient B cells. As JNK activation requires both Rac1
(602048) and PLC-gamma-2, Ishiai et al. (1999) concluded that BLNK
regulates the Rac1-JNK pathway, in addition to modulating PLC-gamma-2
localization.

Jumaa et al. (2003) showed that the differentiation regulator SLP65
inhibits pre-B-cell leukemia in mice. Reconstitution of SLP65 expression
in an SLP65 -/- pre-B-cell line led to enhanced differentiation in vitro
and prevented the development of pre-B-cell leukemia in immune-deficient
mice. Tyrosine-96 of SLP65 was required for this activity. The murine
knockout SLP65 pre-B-cell leukemia resembles human childhood pre-B ALL.
Indeed, 16 of the 34 childhood pre-B ALL samples that were tested showed
a complete loss or drastic reduction of SLP65 expression. Jumaa et al.
(2003) suggested that this loss is probably due to the incorporation of
alternative exons into SLP65 transcripts, leading to premature stop
codons. Thus, Jumaa et al. (2003) concluded that the somatic loss of
SLP65 and the accompanying block in pre-B-cell differentiation might be
one of the primary causes of childhood pre-B ALL.

Taguchi et al. (2004) identified a pre-B ALL cell line lacking BLNK
expression in which stimulation of pre-BCR resulted in an absence of
phosphorylation of PLCG2 and an increase in intracellular calcium. In
contrast, activation of MAP kinase (see 602425) and phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (see 601232) signaling was not affected. Taguchi et al. (2004)
concluded that BLNK is essential for PLCG2-induced calcium influx and
that BLNK-deficient cell lines may provide an in vitro model for
investigation of the role of BLNK in the pre-B-cell receptor-mediated
signaling mechanism.

Kohler et al. (2005) found that the leucine zipper in the highly
conserved N terminus of mouse Slp65 was essential for its association
with the plasma membrane. Mutation of critical leucines in the zipper
region abolished membrane association, as demonstrated by flow cytometry
and immunofluorescence microscopy.

Sprangers et al. (2006) identified defective SLP65 expression in 7 of 28
cases of pre-B lymphoblastic leukemia and 5 of 27 cases of B-cell
lymphoma. SLP65 deficiency correlated with RAG1 (179615)/RAG2 (179616)
expression and unremitting VH gene rearrangement activity.
Reconstitution of SLP65 expression in SLP65-deficient leukemia and
lymphoma cell lines resulted in RAG1/RAG2 downregulation and prevented
de novo VH-DJH rearrangements and secondary VH replacement. Sprangers et
al. (2006) concluded that iterative VH gene rearrangement represents a
frequent feature in B-lymphoid malignancy and can be attributed to SLP65
deficiency in many cases.

GENE STRUCTURE

The BLNK gene comprises 17 exons spread over about 65 kb of DNA
(Minegishi et al., 1999).

MAPPING

Minegishi et al. (1999) mapped the BLNK gene to chromosome 10q23.2 using
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a boy with agammaglobulinemia and absent B cells (AGM4; 613502),
Minegishi et al. (1999) identified a homozygous splice defect in the
BLNK gene (604515.0001). Although this patient had normal numbers of
pro-B cells, he had no pre-B cells or mature B cells, indicating that
BLNK plays a critical role in orchestrating the pro-B cell to pre-B cell
transition. The patient had developed recurrent otitis at 8 months of
age; after 2 episodes of pneumonia, he was evaluated for
immunodeficiency at 16 months of age. At that time, he had no detectable
serum IgG, IgM, or IgA, and he had less than 1% B cells in the
peripheral circulation. He was started on gammaglobulin replacement, and
between 2 and 20 years of age he did well except for chronic otitis and
sinusitis, hepatitis C acquired from intravenous gammaglobulin, and an
episode of protein-losing enteropathy in adolescence.

ANIMAL MODEL

Pappu et al. (1999) generated mice deficient in Blnk by targeted
disruption. B-cell development in Blnk -/- mice was blocked at the
transition from B220+CD43+ progenitor B to B220+CD43- precursor B cells.
Only a small percentage of IgM M++, but not mature IgM(lo)IgD(hi), B
cells were detected in the periphery. Pappu et al. (1999) concluded that
BLNK is an essential component of the BCR signaling pathways and is
required to promote B-cell development.

Flemming et al. (2003) showed that both wildtype and Slp65 -/- bone
marrow-derived B cells required IL7 (146660) for proliferation. In the
absence of IL7, or by the reintroduction of Slp65, many mutant cells
expressed surface IgM and downregulated the pre-BCR. Cells lacking both
the pre-BCR and Slp65 had severely reduced proliferative capacity due to
a requirement for pre-B-cell receptor signaling leading to Erk (see
MAPK1; 176948) activation and Slp65 -/- cell survival. Flemming et al.
(2003) also found that Slp65-deficient mice were significantly more
likely to develop pre-B-cell lymphoma and solid tumors than were
wildtype mice. The authors concluded that SLP65 acts as an efficient
tumor suppressor by accelerating the progression of cells through a
mutation-prone developmental stage.

Hayashi et al. (2004) showed that anti-DNA Ig knockin mice had impaired
BCR editing at multiple levels in the absence of Bash. Mice lacking Bash
also had excessive antibody responses to DNA carrier immunization.
Hayashi et al. (2004) concluded that BCR-signaled receptor editing
contributes to establishing B-cell tolerance.

In a 20-year-old male with early-onset hypoglobulinemia and absent B
cells (613502), Minegishi et al. (1999) identified a homozygous
alteration of the first exon of the BLNK gene and its flanking intronic
sequence. Two noncontiguous basepair substitutions were identified. The
first was a C-to-A substitution of the third basepair position in codon
10, which encoded a silent proline substitution. The second alteration
was an A-to-T transversion at the +3 position of the splice donor site
for intron 1, 20 basepairs downstream from the alteration in codon 10.
SSCP analysis of DNA from 100 unrelated individuals did not reveal the
same pattern as that of the patient. Minegishi et al. (1999) derived
cDNA directly from this patient's bone marrow and used RT-PCR analysis
to examine the abundance of BLNK transcripts. No BLNK transcripts could
be amplified from the patient's bone marrow. The patient's mother and
father, who were heterozygous for both basepair substitutions in BLNK,
were healthy and had normal concentrations of serum immunoglobulins and
normal numbers of B cells. An older brother developed recurrent otitis
at 6 months of age and died at 16 months of age of pseudomonas sepsis
and neutropenia.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Wybutosine (yW) is a hypermodified guanosine at the 3-prime position
adjacent to the anticodon of phenylalanine tRNA that stabilizes
codon-anticodon interactions during decoding on the ribosome. LCMT2 is
the human homolog of a yeast gene essential for yW synthesis (Noma and
Suzuki, 2006).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a brain cDNA library, Nagase et al.
(1998) cloned LCMT2, which they designated KIAA0547. The transcript
contains several repetitive elements in its 3-prime UTR, and the deduced
protein contains 686 amino acids. RT-PCR detected LCMT2 expression in
kidney only. In vitro-translated LCMT3 had an apparent molecular mass of
61 kD by SDS-PAGE.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the LCMT2 gene
to chromosome 4. However, Hartz (2013) mapped the LCMT2 gene to
chromosome 15q15.3 based on an alignment of the LCMT2 sequence (GenBank
GENBANK AF265443) with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

GGCT (EC 2.3.2.4) catalyzes the formation of 5-oxoproline (pyroglutamic
acid) from gamma-glutamyl dipeptides and may play a significant role in
glutathione homeostasis (Oakley et al., 2008).

CLONING

By mass spectrometric analysis of peptides obtained from an
apoptosis-inducing protein, followed by database analysis and RT-PCR of
total RNA from a human leukemia cell line, Masuda et al. (2006) cloned
GGCT, which they called CRF21. SDS-PAGE detected purified CRF21 at an
apparent molecular mass of 21 kD.

Using tryptic peptides obtained from GGCT partially purified from
expired human red blood cells for database analysis, Oakley et al.
(2008) obtained a full-length GGCT cDNA. The deduced 188-amino acid
protein has a calculated molecular mass of 21 kD. EST database analysis
revealed moderate GGCT expression in a wide range of human tissues, with
highest levels in bladder and salivary gland. Database analysis
identified GGCT orthologs in a range of species from C. elegans to
mammals, but not in plants.

GENE FUNCTION

Geranylgeraniol (GGO) induces apoptosis in human tumor cell lines
through a mitochondria-dependent pathway that includes cytochrome c
release. Masuda et al. (2006) found that GGO was unable to induce
cytochrome c release from isolated human mitochondria directly, and they
identified CRF21 as a cytosolic cytochrome c-releasing factor involved
in GGO-induced apoptosis. Overexpression of CRF21 in HeLa cells induced
cytochrome c release and apoptosis. Masuda et al. (2006) noted that
GGO-induced apoptosis was inhibited by a dominant-negative mutation of
JNK (MAPK8; 601158) that impeded JNK signaling, suggesting involvement
of JNK and CRF21 in GGO-induced apoptosis.

Oakley et al. (2008) confirmed that recombinant human GGCT used
gamma-glutamyl-L-alanine as its substrate. The enzymatic kinetics were
similar to those of GGCT purified from human erythrocytes.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Oakley et al. (2008) determined the crystal structure of recombinant
human GGCT to 2.4-angstrom resolution. GGCT adopted a mixed alpha/beta
topology with 6 beta stands, 5 alpha helices, and 4 short 3(10) helices,
and it assumed a unique structural fold that the authors termed a GGCT
fold. GGCT formed dimers, and each monomer featured an invagination that
Oakley et al. (2008) proposed was the active site. The site was lined
with hydrophilic and amphipathic residues, including a conserved glu98
that appeared to function as a general acid/base in the reaction.
Mutation of glu98 to ala or gln did not alter the structural fold, but
it completely inactivated the enzyme. Mutation analysis showed that
gly23 and tyr105 also contributed to substrate binding interactions.

GENE STRUCTURE

Oakley et al. (2008) determined that the GGCT gene contains 5 exons and
spans 8 kb.

MAPPING

Bissbort et al. (1984) assigned the GGCT gene to chromosome 7pter-p14 by
somatic cell hybrid studies.

By genomic sequence analysis, Oakley et al. (2008) mapped the GGCT gene
to chromosome 7p15-p14. They identified putative GGCT pseudogenes on
chromosomes 5 and 20. Oakley et al. (2008) noted that the mouse Ggct
gene maps to a region of chromosome 6 that shares homology of synteny
with human chromosome 7p15-p14.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

CD40 (109535) is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)
family. The short cytoplasmic domain of CD40 contains a region with
limited homology to the conserved cytosolic death domain of TNFR1
(191190) and FAS (134637). Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay with the
cytoplasmic domain of CD40 as bait, Hu et al. (1994) isolated B-cell
cDNAs encoding a protein that they called CD40-binding protein (CD40bp).
The predicted CD40bp protein contains a RING finger DNA-binding motif, a
cys/his-rich region, and a coiled-coil domain. Like TRAF1 (601711) and
TRAF2 (601895), both TNFR2 (75-kD TNFR; 191191)-binding proteins, CD40bp
contains a C-terminal TRAF domain. In vitro translated CD40bp has an
apparent molecular mass of 64 kD. Coimmunoprecipitation studies
indicated that CD40bp interacts with CD40 in human B cells. Hu et al.
(1994) suggested that CD40bp, along with TRAF1 and TRAF2, comprise a
family of proteins that associate with the cytoplasmic faces of the TNFR
family and have in common a TRAF domain.

Independently, Sato et al. (1995) and Cheng et al. (1995) identified
CD40bp, designating it CAP1 (CD40-associated protein-1) and CRAF1 (CD40
receptor-associated factor 1), respectively. Sato et al. (1995)
demonstrated that CAP1 binds specifically to the cytoplasmic domain of
CD40, but not to that of TNFR1, TNFR2, or FAS. The C-terminal TRAF
domain of CAP1 was sufficient to mediate binding to CD40 and
homodimerization. Cheng et al. (1995) isolated mouse and human CRAF1
cDNAs. The predicted 568-amino acid human protein is 96% identical to
mouse CRAF1. These authors divided the TRAF domain into 2 regions:
TRAF-N, the more N-terminal coiled-coil subdomain, and TRAF-C, which was
necessary and sufficient for CRAF1 to interact with CD40. Overexpression
of a truncated cDNA encoding the entire TRAF domain of CRAF1 inhibited
CD40-mediated upregulation of the CD23 (151445) gene, which suggested to
Cheng et al. (1995) that CRAF1 participates in CD40 signaling.

MAPPING

Gross (2012) mapped the TRAF3 gene to chromosome 14q32.32 based on an
alignment of the TRAF3 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC075086) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

The cytoplasmic C terminus of the Epstein-Barr virus latent infection
membrane protein-1 (LMP1) is essential for B lymphocyte growth
transformation. LMP1 is an integral membrane protein that has
transforming effects in nonlymphoid cells, and may act by constitutively
activating a common cellular growth factor receptor pathway. Mosialos et
al. (1995) found that CD40bp, which they called LAP1 (LMP1-associated
protein-1), interacted with the LMP1 C-terminal domain. Expression of
LMP1 caused LAP1 and TRAF1 (EBI6) to localize to LMP1 clusters in
lymphoblast plasma membranes, and LMP1 coimmunoprecipitated with these
proteins in cell extracts. LAP1 bound to the cytoplasmic domains of CD40
and LT-beta-R (600979) in vitro, and associated with p80 (TNFR2) in
vivo. Northern blot analysis revealed that LAP1 was expressed as a
full-length 2.8-kb mRNA and an alternatively spliced 1.8-kb mRNA in all
tissues tested. Mosialos et al. (1995) concluded that the interaction of
LAP1 with LMP1 and with the cytoplasmic domains of TNFR family members
is evidence for a central role of this protein as an effector of cell
growth or death signaling pathways.

Dadgostar et al. (2003) determined that the coiled-coil domain of mouse
T3jam (608255) interacted with the isoleucine zipper domain of Traf3.
T3jam did not associate with other Traf family members. Coexpression of
T3jam and Traf3 recruited Traf3 to the detergent-insoluble fraction, and
T3jam and Traf3 synergistically activated JNK (601158), but not nuclear
factor kappa-B (see 164011).

To dissect biochemically Toll-like receptor signaling, Hacker et al.
(2006) established a system for isolating signaling complexes assembled
by dimerized adaptors. Using MyD88 (602170) as a prototypic adaptor,
they identified TRAF3 as a new component of Toll/interleukin-1 receptor
signaling complexes that is recruited along with TRAF6 (602355). Using
myeloid cells from Traf3- and Traf6-deficient mice, Hacker et al. (2006)
demonstrated that TRAF3 is essential for the induction of type I
interferons and the antiinflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL10;
124092), but is dispensable for expression of proinflammatory cytokines.
In fact, Traf3-deficient cells overproduced proinflammatory cytokines
owing to defective Il10 production. Despite their structural similarity,
the functions of TRAF3 and TRAF6 are largely distinct. TRAF3 is also
recruited to the adaptor TRIF (607601) and is required for marshalling
the protein kinase TBK1 (604834) into Toll/interleukin-1 receptor
signaling complexes, thereby explaining its unique role in activation of
the interferon response.

Oganesyan et al. (2006) demonstrated that cells lacking TRAF3 are
defective in type I interferon responses activated by several different
Toll-like receptors. Furthermore, they showed that TRAF3 associates with
the Toll-like receptor adaptors TRIF and IRAK1 (300283), as well as
downstream IRF3/7 kinases TBK1 and IKK-epsilon (605048), suggesting that
TRAF3 serves as a critical link between Toll-like receptor adaptors and
downstream regulatory kinases important for IRF activation. In addition
to TLR stimulation, Oganesyan et al. (2006) showed that TRAF3-deficient
fibroblasts are defective in their type I interferon response to direct
infection with vesicular stomatitis virus, indicating that TRAF3 is also
an important component of TLR-independent viral recognition pathways.
Oganesyan et al. (2006) concluded that TRAF3 is a major regulator of
type I interferon production and the innate antiviral response.

Production of type I interferon is a critical host defense triggered by
pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) of the innate immune system.
Kayagaki et al. (2007) demonstrated that reduction of DUBA (300713)
augmented the PRR-induced type I interferon response in transfected
HEK293 cells, whereas ectopic expression of DUBA had the converse
effect. DUBA bound TRAF3, an adaptor protein essential for type I
interferon response. TRAF3 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that preferentially
assembled lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains in cotransfection assays.
DUBA selectively cleaved the lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains on TRAF3,
resulting in its dissociation from the downstream signaling complex
containing TBK1. A discrete ubiquitin interaction motif within DUBA was
required for efficient deubiquitination of TRAF3 and optimal suppression
of type I interferon. Kayagaki et al. (2007) concluded that their data
identified DUBA as a negative regulator of innate immune responses.

Cytokine signaling is thought to require assembly of multicomponent
signaling complexes at cytoplasmic segments of membrane-embedded
receptors, in which receptor-proximal protein kinases are activated.
Matsuzawa et al. (2008) reported that, upon ligation, CD40 formed a
complex containing adaptor molecules TRAF2 and TRAF3,
ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC13 (UBE2N; 603679), cellular inhibitor
of apoptosis protein-1 (CIAP1, or BIRC2; 601712) and -2 (CIAP2, or
BIRC3; 601721), IKK-gamma (IKBKG; 300248), and MEKK1 (MAP3K1; 600982).
TRAF2, UBC13, and IKK-gamma were required for complex assembly and
activation of MEKK1 and MAP kinase cascades. However, the kinases were
not activated unless the complex was translocated from the membrane to
the cytosol upon CIAP1/CIAP2-induced degradation of TRAF3. Matsuzawa et
al. (2008) proposed that this 2-stage signaling mechanism may apply to
other innate immune receptors and may account for spatial and temporal
separation of MAPK and IKK signaling.

Hu et al. (2013) identified the deubiquitinase OTUD7B (611748) as a
pivotal regulator of the noncanonical NF-kappa-B pathway. OTUD7B
deficiency in mice has no appreciable effect on canonical NF-kappa-B
activation but causes hyperactivation of noncanonical NF-kappa-B. In
response to noncanonical NF-kappa-B stimuli, OTUD7B binds and
deubiquitinates TRAF3, thereby inhibiting TRAF3 proteolysis and
preventing aberrant noncanonical NF-kappa-B activation. Consequently,
the OTUD7B deficiency results in B-cell hyperresponsiveness to antigens,
lymphoid follicular hyperplasia in the intestinal mucosa, and elevated
host-defense ability against an intestinal bacterial pathogen,
Citrobacter rodentium. Hu et al. (2013) concluded that their findings
established OTUD7B as a crucial regulator of signal-induced noncanonical
NF-kappa-B activation, and indicated a mechanism of immune regulation
that involves OTUD7B-mediated deubiquitination and stabilization of
TRAF3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Braggio et al. (2009) identified biallelic inactivation of TRAF3 in 3
(5.3%) of 57 Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM; see 153600) samples.
TRAF3 inactivation was associated with transcriptional activation of
NF-kappa-B (NFKB1; 164011). In addition, 1 of 24 patients with a 6q
deletion had an inactivating somatic mutation in TNFAIP3 (191163),
another negative regulator of NF-kappa-B. Monoallelic deletions of
chromosome 6q23, including the TNFAIP3 gene, were identified in 38% of
patients, suggesting that haploinsufficiency can predispose to the
development of WM. The results indicated that mutational activation of
the NF-kappa-B pathway plays a role in the pathogenesis of WM.

Perez de Diego et al. (2010) investigated an 18-year-old French female
who had suffered from herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE; 614849) at age 4
years and who lacked mutations in either the UNC93B1 (608204) or TLR3
(603029) genes. They identified a heterozygous C-to-T substitution at
position 352 in exon 4 of the TRAF3 gene, resulting in a nonconservative
missense change, arg118 to trp (R118W; 601896.0001). The mutation was
not found in her parents or brothers, and none had a history of HSE.
RT-PCR analysis of the patient's cells detected normal levels of TRAF3
mRNA, but Western blot analysis showed severely reduced levels of TRAF3
protein. Responsiveness to TLR3 agonists was impaired, as indicated by
deficient NFKB activation and poor production of IFNB (147640), IFNL
(IL29; 607403), and IL6 (147620). Expression of wildtype and mutant
alleles in cell lines showed that the mutant was dominant-negative.
TRAF3-deficient fibroblasts had impaired type I and type III
IFN-dependent control of viruses and deficient responses through the
TNFR (e.g., TNFRSF5; 109535) pathways. Perez de Diego et al. (2010)
concluded that, whereas complete Traf3 deficiency is neonatal lethal in
mice, decreases in TRAF3 production and function result in
predisposition to HSE, a condition that is usually fatal if untreated.

without prophylaxis and showed normal resistance to other infectious

They identified a de novo heterozygous 352C-T transition in exon 4 of
the TRAF3 gene, resulting in an arg118-to-trp (R118W) substitution, in
this patient, whose HSE was successfully treated with acyclovir for 3

601873	TITLE *601873 BETA-1,4-N-ACETYLGALACTOSAMINYLTRANSFERASE 1; B4GALNT1
;;BETA-1,4-N-ACETYLGALACTOSAMINYLTRANSFERASE; GALGT;;
GalNAcT;;
GM2/GD2 SYNTHASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The B4GALNT1 gene encodes beta-1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyl transferase-1
(EC 2.4.1.92), an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of complex
gangliosides (G), which are mono- (M), di- (D), and tri- (T) sialic
acid-containing glycosphingolipids generated by sequential
glycosylations. Gangliosides are part of the larger family of
glycosphingolipids and are components of the synaptic plasma membrane
involved in synaptic plasticity, signal transduction, and endocytosis
and then are critical for central nervous system development. B4GALNT1
catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine into GM3, GD3, and
globotriaosylceramide by a beta-1,4 linkage (summary by Boukhris et al.,
2013).

CLONING

Nagata et al. (1992) used expression cloning to isolate the cDNA for
beta-1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (GalNAcT), or G(M2)/G(D2)
synthase. The cDNA encodes a 561-amino acid polypeptide. Northern blot
analysis revealed that the gene is expressed as 2 differently sized
transcripts in all cells tested that expressed G(MS), G(D2), or both.
These findings indicate that the cDNAs catalyze the transfer of GalNAc
into G(M3) and G(D3) by a beta-1,4 linkage, resulting in the synthesis
of G(M2) and G(D2), respectively.

GENE STRUCTURE

Furukawa et al. (1996) examined the genomic structure of the human
GalNAcT gene and found that it contains more than 11 exons spanning over
8 kb of genomic DNA. They reported that the gene has at least 3 distinct
transcription initiation sites that may be involved in cell
type-specific gene expression.

MAPPING

By FISH, Furukawa et al. (1996) mapped the GALGT gene to 12q13.3. Hamlin
et al. (1998) mapped the GALGT and KIF5A (602821) genes to 12q13 by
FISH. They found that these genes are contained within the same
approximately 200-kb YAC insert as the GLI (165220) and DDIT3 (126337)
genes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By exome sequencing of 5 families with autosomal recessive spastic
paraplegia-26 (SPG26; 609195), Boukhris et al. (2013) identified 5
different homozygous mutations in the B4GALNT1 gene. The mutations
segregated with the disorder in the families and were not found in large
control databases. Subsequent analysis of this gene identified
pathogenic mutations in 2 of 65 additional probands with a similar
disorder. All mutations were truncating, except for 2 missense mutations
that occurred at highly conserved residues (see, e.g.,
601873.0001-601873.0005). No functional studies were performed. The
phenotype was characterized by onset in the first 2 decades of life of
gait abnormalities due to lower limb spasticity and muscle weakness.
Some patients had upper limb involvement. Additional features included
intellectual disability, peripheral neuropathy, dysarthria, cerebellar
signs, extrapyramidal signs, and cortical atrophy. The disorder was
slowly progressive.

ANIMAL MODEL

Takamiya et al. (1996) found that mice with a disrupted B4galnt1 gene
lacked all complex gangliosides, but did did not show any major
histologic defects in their nervous systems or in gross behavior.
Electrophysiologic studies showed a slight reduction in the neural
conduction velocity from the tibial nerve to the somatosensory cortex,
but not to the lumbar spine. The findings suggested that complex
gangliosides are required in neuronal functions, such as synaptic
transmission, but not in the morphogenesis and organogenesis of the
brain. Higher levels of GM3 and GD3 expressed in the brains of these
mutant mice may have been able to compensate for the lack of complex
gangliosides.

Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC; 257220) is a progressive
neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the NPC1 gene (607623)
and characterized by intracellular accumulation of cholesterol and
sphingolipids. To determine the relative contribution of ganglioside
accumulation in the neuropathogenesis of Niemann-Pick C disease, Liu et
al. (2000) bred NPC model mice with mice carrying a targeted mutation in
GalNAcT. Unlike the NPC model mice, the double mutant mice did not
exhibit central nervous system accumulation of gangliosides GM2 or of
glycolipids GA1 and GA2. Histologic analysis revealed that the
characteristic neuronal storage pathology of NPC disease was
substantially reduced in the double mutant mice. By contrast, visceral
pathology was similar in the NPC and double mutant mice. Most notably,
the clinical phenotype of the double mutant mice, in the absence of CNS
ganglioside accumulation and associated neuronal pathology, did not
improve. The authors concluded that complex ganglioside storage, while
responsible for much of the neuronal pathology, did not significantly
influence the clinical phenotype of the NPC model.

146680	TITLE *146680 INSULIN-DEGRADING ENZYME; IDE
;;INSULYSIN;;
INSULINASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Insulin-degrading enzyme (EC 3.4.24.56), also known as insulysin, is a
110-kD neutral metallopeptidase that can degrade a number of peptides,
including insulin (176730) and beta-amyloid (104760) (Qiu et al., 1998).

CLONING

Affholter et al. (1988) isolated and sequenced a cDNA coding for IDE.
The deduced amino acid sequence of the enzyme contained the sequences of
13 peptides derived from the isolated protein. The cDNA transcribed in
vitro yielded a synthetic RNA that in cell-free translations produced a
protein that coelectrophoresed with the native proteinase and could be
immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibodies to IDE. Since the deduced
sequence of this proteinase did not contain the consensus sequences for
any of the known classes of proteinases (i.e., metallo, cysteine,
aspartic, or serine), it may be a member of a family of proteases that
are involved in intercellular peptide signaling. It did show homology to
an Escherichia coli proteinase (called protease III), which also cleaves
insulin and is present in the periplasmic space; thus, they may be
members of the same family of proteases.

GENE FUNCTION

Qiu et al. (1998) determined that the extracellular thiol
metalloprotease capable of degrading amyloid-beta protein identified by
Qiu et al. (1997) is the same as IDE. By Western blot analysis, they
found a full-length 110-kD IDE band in the CSF of normal individuals and
of patients with Alzheimer disease (AD; 104300) or non-Alzheimer
dementia. They found no difference in IDE levels of the normal and
patient populations. By biochemical analysis of IDE purified from the
medium of a mouse microglial cell line, they determined that IDE could
degrade both endogenous and synthetic amyloid-beta protein and that it
could catalyze the oligomerization of this protein.

Through a series of inhibitor studies, in vitro translation, and
biochemical assays of rat IDE expressed by transfected human kidney
cells, Edbauer et al. (2002) determined that IDE may be the protease
responsible for the clearance of the cytoplasmic fragment of the
amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) following liberation of the
amyloid-beta protein.

IDE has a preferential affinity for insulin such that the presence of
insulin will inhibit IDE-mediated degradation of other substances,
including beta-amyloid. Cook et al. (2003) found that hippocampal IDE
levels were reduced by approximately 50% in AD patients with the APOE4
(107741) allele compared to AD patients without the APOE4 allele and to
controls with or without the APOE4 allele. The findings suggested that
reduced IDE expression may be a risk factor for AD, and that IDE may
interact with APOE status to affect beta-amyloid metabolism.

Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes chickenpox and shingles. While
varicella is likely spread as cell-free virus to susceptible hosts, the
virus is transmitted by cell-to-cell spread in the body and in vitro. Li
et al. (2006) found that the extracellular domain of IDE interacted with
VZV glycoprotein E (gE), a protein essential for viral infection.
Downregulation of IDE by small interfering RNA or blocking IDE with
antibody, with soluble IDE protein extracted from liver, or with
bacitracin inhibited VZV infection. Cell-to-cell spread of virus was
also impaired by blocking IDE. Transfection of cell lines impaired for
VZV infection with a plasmid expressing human IDE resulted in increased
entry and enhanced infection with cell-free and cell-associated virus.
Li et al. (2006) concluded that IDE is a cellular receptor for both
cell-free and cell-associated VZV.

MAPPING

Affholter et al. (1990) mapped the IDE gene to human chromosome 10 and
mouse chromosome 19 by hybridization of cDNA probes to human-rodent or
mouse-hamster somatic cell hybrids, respectively. By a combination of
somatic cell hybrid analysis and in situ hybridization, Espinosa et al.
(1991) localized the IDE gene to 10q23-q25.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

For a discussion of a possible association between variation in the IDE
gene and late-onset Alzheimer disease, see AD6 (605526), which maps to
chromosome 10q23-q25.

Abraham et al. (2001) analyzed all of the coding exons, untranslated
regions, and 1,000 bp of 5-prime flanking sequence of IDE by means of
denaturing HPLC and sequencing. They detected 8 single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs), of which 3 were found at lower than 5% frequency.
None of them changed the amino acid sequence. Abraham et al. (2001)
found no significant association between any individual SNP and
late-onset AD (LOAD) or with any haplotypes. They concluded that IDE
does not make a substantial contribution to the etiology of late-onset
AD and therefore cannot account for the linkage between late-onset AD
and 10q.

Prince et al. (2003) used a SNP genetic association strategy to
investigate AD in relation to a 480-kb region encompassing IDE. They
interpreted the results as providing 'substantial' evidence that genetic
variation within or very close to IDE impacts both disease risk and
traits related to the severity of AD.

Risk for LOAD and plasma amyloid-beta levels (APP; 104760), an
intermediate phenotype for LOAD, show linkage to chromosome 10q.
Ertekin-Taner et al. (2004) reported pathogenic variants in the 276-kb
region of 10q harboring the IDE gene that influence intermediate DNA
phenotypes and risk for AD.

Bian et al. (2004) reported an association between a T/C polymorphism
(dbSNP rs4646953) in the 5-prime untranslated region of the the IDE
gene, and AD in Han Chinese patients with the APOE4 allele. They found
no association between several IDE polymorphisms and AD among patients
without the E4 allele.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Shen et al. (2006) reported the crystal structure of human IDE in
complex with 4 substrates, the insulin B chain (see 176730), amyloid
beta(1-40), amylin (147940), and glucagon (138030). The amino- and
carboxy-terminal domains of IDE form an enclosed cage just large enough
to encapsulate insulin. Extensive contacts between these domains keep
the degradation chamber of IDE inaccessible to substrates. Repositioning
of the IDE domains enables substrate access to the catalytic cavity. IDE
uses size and charge distribution of the substrate-binding cavity
selectively to entrap structurally diverse polypeptides. The enclosed
substrate undergoes conformational changes to form beta-sheets with 2
discrete regions of IDE for its degradation. Consistent with this model,
mutations disrupting the contacts between the amino- and carboxy-termini
of IDE increase IDE catalytic activity 40-fold.

ANIMAL MODEL

Genetic analysis of the diabetic GK rat has revealed several diabetes
susceptibility loci (see 125853). Fakhrai-Rad et al. (2000) mapped one
such locus, NIDDM1B, to a 1-cM region by genetic and pathophysiologic
characterization of new congenic substrains for the locus. The IDE gene
was also mapped to this 1-cM region, and 2 amino acid substitutions
(H18R and A890V) were identified in the GK allele which reduced
insulin-degrading activity by 31% in transfected cells. However, when
the H18R and A890V variants were studied separately, no effects were
observed, suggesting a synergistic effect of the 2 variants on insulin
degradation. No effect on insulin degradation was observed in cell
lysates, suggesting that the effect may be coupled to receptor-mediated
internalization of insulin. Congenic rats with the IDE GK allele
displayed postprandial hyperglycemia, reduced lipogenesis in fat cells,
blunted insulin-stimulated glucose transmembrane uptake, and reduced
insulin degradation in isolated muscle. Analysis of additional rat
strains demonstrated that the dysfunctional IDE allele was unique to GK
rats. The authors concluded that IDE plays an important role in the
diabetic phenotype in GK rats.

Factors that elevate amyloid-beta (104760) peptide levels are associated
with an increased risk for Alzheimer disease. Insulysin is one of
several proteases potentially involved in degradation of amyloid-beta,
based on its hydrolysis of amyloid-beta peptides in vitro. In an
insulysin-deficient gene-trap mouse model, Miller et al. (2003) found
that in vivo levels of brain A-beta-40 and A-beta-42 peptides were
increased significantly. A 6-fold increase in the level of the
gamma-secretase-generated C-terminal fragment of the A-beta precursor
protein also was found in the insulysin-deficient mouse. In mice
heterozygous for the insulysin gene trap, in which insulysin activity
levels were decreased approximately 50%, brain A-beta peptides were
increased to levels intermediate between those in wildtype mice and
homozygous insulysin gene-trap mice that had no detectable insulysin
activity. These findings indicated that there is an inverse correlation
between in vivo insulysin activity levels and brain A-beta peptide
levels and suggested that modulation of insulysin activity may alter the
risk for Alzheimer disease.

Farris et al. (2003) generated mice deficient in IDE by targeted
disruption. Ide deficiency resulted in a greater than 50% decrease in
amyloid-beta degradation in both membrane fractions and primary neuronal
cultures and a similar deficit in insulin degradation in liver. The
Ide-null mice showed increased cerebral accumulation of endogenous
amyloid-beta, a hallmark of Alzheimer disease, and had hyperinsulinemia
and glucose intolerance (see 176730), hallmarks of type II diabetes.
Moreover, the mice had elevated levels of the intracellular signaling
domain of the beta-amyloid precursor protein, which had recently been
found to be degraded by IDE in vitro. Farris et al. (2003) concluded
that, together with emerging genetic evidence, their in vivo findings
suggest that IDE hypofunction may underlie or contribute to some forms
of Alzheimer disease and type II diabetes and provide a mechanism for
the recognized association among hyperinsulinemia, diabetes, and
Alzheimer disease.

Leissring et al. (2003) found that developmentally delayed,
neuron-specific overexpression of Ide or neprilysin (MME; 120520) in
mice significantly reduced brain beta-amyloid levels, retarded or
prevented amyloid plaque formation and its associated cytopathology, and
rescued the premature lethality in APP transgenic mice. They concluded
that chronic upregulation of beta-amyloid-degrading proteases may combat
Alzheimer-type pathology in vivo.

603129	TITLE *603129 LIM DOMAIN ONLY 4; LMO4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The LIM domain, an approximately 55-residue cysteine-rich zinc-binding
motif, is present in a variety of proteins, including LIM homeobox
proteins that contain 2 LIM domains and 1 homeodomain. The nuclear
LIM-only proteins (e.g., LMO2; 180385) lack a DNA-binding homeodomain.
To identify novel LIM domain transcription factors, Kenny et al. (1998)
screened 2 mouse embryonic expression libraries using the LIM
interaction domain of the widely expressed nuclear LIM interactor (NLI,
or LDB1; 603451), to which the LIM domains of nuclear proteins bind with
high affinity. They reported the isolation and characterization of LMO4,
a novel LIM-only gene that is highly expressed in the T-lymphocyte
lineage, cranial neural crest cells, somite, dorsal limb bud mesenchyme,
motor neurons, and Schwann cell progenitors. LMO1 (186921), LMO2, and
LMO4 were found to have distinct expression patterns in adult tissue.
Mesenchymal and thymic blast cell expression patterns of LMO4 and LMO2
were consistent with the suggestion that LMO genes inhibit
differentiation.

Using autologous patient serum to screen a human breast tumor cDNA
expression library, followed by screening a testis cDNA library,
Racevskis et al. (1999) cloned LMO4. The 5-prime end of the transcript
is highly GC rich (74%), with some stretches exceeding 90%, and the
3-prime UTR contains an RNA destabilization motif. Except for a
proline-rich N terminus, the deduced 165-amino acid protein is composed
entirely of 2 tandem LIM domains. The mouse and human LMO4 proteins are
identical. Northern blot analysis detected LMO4 expression in most human
tissues analyzed, with highest levels in brain, skeletal muscle, testis,
and ovary. No expression was detected in liver, kidney, and pancreas.
The expression pattern was somewhat different than that found in mouse.

Using Northern blot analysis, Wittlin et al. (2003) detected LMO4
transcripts of about 2.1 and 2.3 kb in normal mammary epithelia and
breast cancer cell lines. A transcript of about 1.7 kb was also detected
in the cancer cell lines, but not in normal epithelial cells. The
variation in transcript size was due to different promoter usage and
splicing.

GENE FUNCTION

Visvader et al. (2001) explored a role for LMO4, initially described as
a human breast tumor autoantigen, in developing mammary epithelium and
breast oncogenesis. The gene was expressed predominantly in the
lobuloalveoli of the mammary gland during pregnancy. Consistent with a
role in proliferation, forced expression of this gene inhibited
differentiation of mammary epithelial cells. Overexpression of LMO4 mRNA
was observed in 5 of 10 human breast cancer cell lines. Moreover, in
situ hybridization analysis of 177 primary invasive breast carcinomas
revealed overexpression of LMO4 in 56% of specimens.
Immunohistochemistry confirmed overexpression in a high percentage (62%)
of tumors. These studies implied a role for LMO4 in maintaining
proliferation of mammary epithelium and suggested that deregulation of
this gene may contribute to breast tumorigenesis.

Using human and mouse expression plasmids in several protein interaction
assays, Sum et al. (2002) identified CTIP (604124) and BRCA1 (113705) as
LMO4-binding proteins. The LMO4-BRCA1 interaction required the
C-terminal BRCT domains of BRCA1. LDB1 also associated with a complex
containing LMO4, CTIP, and BRCA1 in transfected human embryonic kidney
cells. In functional assays, LMO4 repressed BRCA1-mediated
transcriptional activation in both yeast and mammalian cells.

Wittlin et al. (2003) found that the 2 LMO4 promoters exhibited strong
activity in breast cancer cell lines that correlated with RNA levels.
Promoter 2 appeared to be selectively activated in certain breast cancer
cell lines but not in immortalized human mammary epithelial cells,
implying aberrant activation of the LMO4 gene in the cancer cell lines.

By mammalian 2-hybrid analysis, Manetopoulos et al. (2003) showed that
the helix-loop-helix protein HEN1 (162360) interacted with both LMO2 and
LMO4. LMO4, but not LMO2, could augment HEN1-mediated repression of E47
(147141) transcriptional activity. LMO4 could also prevent HEN1-mediated
neurite extension in rat hippocampal precursor cells. Manetopoulos et
al. (2003) concluded that LMO4 can modulate the transcriptional activity
of HEN1.

Sum et al. (2005) found that downregulation of LMO4 expression by RNA
interference reduced proliferation of human breast cancer cells and
increased differentiation of mouse mammary epithelial cells.
Furthermore, transfection of small interfering RNA into breast cancer
cells reduced the capacity of the cells to migrate and invade an
extracellular matrix. Conversely, overexpression of LMO4 in noninvasive,
immortalized human breast epithelial cells promoted cell motility and
invasion. Sum et al. (2005) also found that high nuclear levels of LMO4
correlated with poor patient outcome in a cohort of 159 primary breast
cancers. They concluded that deregulation of LMO4 in breast epithelium
contributes directly to breast neoplasia by altering the rate of
cellular proliferation and promoting cell invasion.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic structure analysis, Tse et al. (1999) determined that the
mouse Lmo4 gene contains 6 exons, the last 4 of which encode the
165-amino acid protein.

Wittlin et al. (2003) determined that the LMO4 gene contains 2 5-prime
noncoding exons, exon 1a and 1b, and exon 2 encodes the first LIM
domain. Promoter 1, upstream of exon 1a, and promoter 2, upstream of
exon 1b, lack canonical TATA or CCAAT boxes, but both contain GC-rich
regions. Promoter 1 also has recognition sites for SP1 (189906) and
Kruppel-like factors (see KLF1; 600599), and promoter 2 has SP1-like
recognition elements, GC boxes, and AP2 (107580) sites.

MAPPING

Tse et al. (1999) mapped the mouse Lmo4 gene to chromosome 3 by
interspecific backcross analysis. Using FISH, they mapped the human LMO4
gene to 1p22.3, a region that is deleted in a number of human cancers.

610932	TITLE *610932 TWINFILIN, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 1; TWF1
;;PROTEIN TYROSINE KINASE 9; PTK9;;
A6 PROTEIN TYROSINE KINASE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening a human embryonic lung fibroblast bacteria expression
library with antiphosphotyrosine antibody, Beeler et al. (1994) cloned
TWF1, which they called A6. The deduced 350-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 40.3 kD. TWF1 has an N-myristoylation site
and several sites for threonine, serine, and tyrosine phosphorylation,
but it lacks a conserved protein kinase catalytic domain. Northern blot
analysis detected a 3.4-kb transcript that was highly expressed in
colon, testis, uterus, ovary, prostate, and lung. Lower expression was
detected in brain, bladder, and heart, and no expression was detected in
liver. In vitro transcription/translation resulted in a 40-kD TWF1
protein, as determined by SDS-PAGE. Southern blot analysis indicated
that TWF1 is conserved in vertebrates.

By searching databases for homologs of yeast twinfilin, Vartiainen et
al. (2000) identified mouse and human TWF1. The mouse and human TWF1
proteins contain 2 cofilin (see CFL1; 601442)-like repeats called
actin-depolymerizing factor (DSTN; 609114) homology (ADFH) domains.
Immunofluorescence microscopy localized Twf1 in a punctate perinuclear
distribution in mouse fibroblasts and neuroblastoma cells. Twf1 also
localized to globular (G)-actin (see 102610)-rich areas of the actin
cytoskeleton in fibroblasts and to filamentous (F)-actin-rich filopodia
in neuroblastoma cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Beeler et al. (1994) showed that recombinant TWF1 underwent
autophosphorylation on tyrosines and serines in an in vitro kinase
assay, and it phosphorylated exogenous substrates on tyrosines.
Recombinant TWF1 had kinase activity similar to that of recombinant
FGFR2 (176943), with optimal activity over pH 6.5 to 7.4 and a
preference for manganese over magnesium as a divalent cofactor.

In contrast to the findings of Beeler et al. (1994), Vartiainen et al.
(2000) found that recombinant mouse Twf1 lacked tyrosine kinase
activity. They showed that Twf1 bound G-actin in a 1:1 stoichiometry and
prevented F-actin assembly in a concentration-dependent manner.
Overexpression of Twf1 in mouse fibroblasts decreased the amount of
stress fibers and caused the appearance of abnormal cytoplasmic actin
filaments. In mouse fibroblasts, Twf1 colocalized with GTP-bound forms
of Cdc42 (116952) and Rac1 (602048) at membrane ruffles and cell-cell
contacts, respectively, and localization of Twf1 in these cells appeared
to be regulated by Rac1.

Paavilainen et al. (2007) showed that the N- and C-terminal ADFH domains
of mouse Twf1, which they called TWF-N and TWF-C, respectively, were
required for actin barbed-end capping. NMR and mutagenesis analyses,
together with biochemical and motility assays, showed that TWF-C bound
G-actin and interacted with the sides of F-actin like ADF and cofilins,
whereas TWF-N bound only G-actin. During filament barbed-end capping,
TWF-N interacted with the terminal actin subunit, and TWF-C bound
between 2 adjacent subunits at the side of the filament. The domain
requirement for actin filament capping by Twf1 was similar to that of
gelsolin (GSN; 137350)-type proteins, suggesting the existence of a
general barbed-end capping mechanism.

In an adaptation of loss-of-function screening to mouse models of
cancer, Meacham et al. (2009) introduced a library of shRNAs into
individual mice using transplantable E-mu-myc lymphoma cells. This
approach allowed them to screen nearly 1,000 genetic alterations in the
context of a single tumor-bearing mouse. Their experiments identified a
central role for regulators of actin dynamics and cell motility in
lymphoma cell homeostasis in vivo. Validation experiments confirmed that
these proteins represent bona fide lymphoma drug targets. Additionally,
suppression of 2 of these targets, Rac2 (602049) and twinfilin
potentiated the action of the front-line chemotherapeutic vincristine,
suggesting a critical relationship between cell motility and tumor
relapse in hematopoietic malignancies.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the TWF1
gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP RH70527).

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The vesicular monoamine transporter acts to accumulate cytosolic
monoamines into synaptic vesicles, using the proton gradient maintained
across the synaptic vesicular membrane. Its proper function is essential
to the correct activity of the monoaminergic systems that have been
implicated in several human neuropsychiatric disorders. The transporter
is a site of action of important drugs, including reserpine and
tetrabenazine (summary by Peter et al., 1993).

See also SLC18A1 (193002).

CLONING

Liu et al. (1992) and Erickson et al. (1992) investigated cDNAs encoding
the synaptic vesicular monoamine transporter in rat brain. Using
sequences from rat brain SVMT, Surratt et al. (1993) identified the
human homolog. Human SVMT shares 92% amino acid identity with the rat
sequence but displays one less consensus site for asparagine N-linked
glycosylation and one more consensus site for phosphorylation by protein
kinase C.

GENE FUNCTION

Tritsch et al. (2012) demonstrated that activation of dopamine neurons
in striatal slices rapidly inhibits action potential firing in both
direct- and indirect-pathway striatal projection neurons through
vesicular release of the inhibitory transmitter GABA. GABA is released
directly from dopaminergic axons but in a manner that is independent of
the vesicular GABA transporter VGAT (SLC32A1). Instead, GABA release
requires activity of the vesicular monoamine transporter VMAT2, which is
the vesicular transporter for dopamine. Furthermore, VMAT2 expression in
GABAergic neurons lacking VGAT is sufficient to sustain GABA release.
Tritsch et al. (2012) concluded that their findings expand the
repertoire of synaptic mechanisms used by dopamine neurons to influence
basal ganglia circuits, show a new substrate whose transport is
dependent on VMAT2, and demonstrate that GABA can function as a bona
fide cotransmitter in monoaminergic neurons.

MAPPING

By Southern blot analysis of human/rodent hybrid cell lines and
fluorescence in situ hybridization, Surratt et al. (1993) mapped the
human SLC18A2 gene to chromosome 10q25. They also demonstrated a TaqI
polymorphism that may prove useful in assessing the gene's involvement
in neuropsychiatric disorders involving monoaminergic brain systems.
Peter et al. (1993) likewise assigned the SLC18A2 gene to chromosome
10q25 using a panel of mouse/human hybrids and in situ hybridization.

Roghani et al. (1996) showed that the mouse Slc18a2 gene maps to mouse
chromosome 19 by linkage analysis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Lin et al. (2005) sequenced the 17.4-kb SLC18A2 promoter region in 23
Caucasian individuals and identified 47 polymorphisms that conferred 13
haplotypes. In vitro analysis showed a 20% difference in promoter
activity between 2 frequent haplotypes and identified some of the SNPs
that influenced promoter activity. In 144 alcoholic patients and 189
controls, they found that haplotypes with -14234G (dbSNP rs363371) and
-2504C of the SLC18A2 promoter region represented a protective factor
against alcoholism (p = 0.0038).

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Segref et al. (1997) identified a yeast gene, MEX67, that encodes a
factor essential for nuclear mRNA export. The Mex67 protein is found at
the nuclear pores, can be UV-crosslinked to polyadenylated RNA, and
interacts with a putative RNA-binding protein in a yeast 2-hybrid
screen. Thus, Segref et al. (1997) suggested that the Mex67 protein
participates directly in the export of mRNA from the nucleus to the
cytoplasm. They reported that the Mex67 protein is homologous to the
human 'tip-associated protein' (TAP).

The 'tyrosine kinase-interacting protein' (Tip) of herpesvirus saimiri
blocks LCK (153390)-mediated signal transduction and is essential for
primary T cell immortalization and for lymphoma induction in vivo. Using
the yeast 2-hybrid system to identify factors that associate with Tip,
Yoon et al. (1997) cloned a cDNA encoding 'tip-associated protein'
(TAP). The predicted 560-amino acid TAP protein migrates as a 65-kD
protein by SDS-PAGE. Northern blot analysis indicated that TAP was
expressed as 2.5- and 4.4-kb mRNAs in all tissues tested. Expression of
Tip and TAP in Jurkat-T cells induced cell aggregation, which was likely
caused by the upregulated surface expression of lymphocyte adhesion
molecules, and NF-kappa-B (164011, 164012) activity. Therefore, Yoon et
al. (1997) suggested that TAP is an important cellular mediator of Tip
function in T-cell transformation by herpesvirus saimiri.

GENE FUNCTION

Gruter et al. (1998) reported the identification of TAP as the cellular
factor that specifically binds to the CTE (constitutive transport
element) of the type D retroviruses. Microinjection experiments
performed in Xenopus oocytes demonstrated that TAP directly stimulates
CTE-dependent export. Furthermore, TAP overcomes the mRNA export block
caused by the presence of saturating amounts of CTE RNA. Thus, TAP, like
its yeast homolog Mex67, is an mRNA nuclear export mediator. TAP is
therefore a cellular RNA binding protein that is directly involved in
the export of its target RNA.

Using binding analysis, Herold et al. (2000) showed that NXF1, NXF2
(300315), and NXF3 (300316) interact with E1BAP5 (605800), as well as
with NXT1 (605811) and NXT2 (300320). The RBDs of NXF1 and NXF2, but not
that of NXF3, were found to bind RNA. Only NXF1, however, could promote
RNA export mediated by the constitutive transport element of simian type
D retrovirus. Both NXF1 and NXF2, but not NXF3, through their C-terminal
NWD loop, could bind to the nucleoporins CAN (NUP214; 114350), NUP153
(603948), and NUP62 (605815). Only NXF1 could bind to NUP98 (601021).
CAT reporter and Western blot assays showed that coexpression of NXF1 or
NXF2, but not NXF3, with NXT1 or NXT2 activated CAT expression,
suggesting that under these conditions NXF1 can also stimulate RNA
export. The LRRs and NTF2 (605813)-like domains are required for export
activity.

Shamsher et al. (2002) found that transportin-2 (603002) forms complexes
with TAP that strictly depend on the presence of RanGTP. The data
supported the conclusion that transportin-2 participates directly in the
export of a large proportion of cellular mRNAs, and that TAP connects
transportin-2 to mRNAs to be exported.

Li et al. (2006) showed that the TAP gene contains a functional
constitutive transport element (CTE) in its alternatively spliced intron
10. TAP mRNA containing this intron is exported to the cytoplasm and is
present in polyribosomes. A small TAP protein is encoded by this mRNA
and can be detected in human and monkey cells. Li et al. (2006)
concluded that TAP regulates expression of its own intron-containing RNA
through a CTE-mediated mechanism, and that CTEs are likely to be
important elements that facilitate efficient expression of mammalian
mRNAs with retained introns.

FMRP (FMR1; 309550) is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling RNA-binding protein
that participates in mRNA transport and translational control. Using
immunoprecipitation analysis and quantitative real-time RT-PCR, Zhang et
al. (2007) showed that Fmrp and Nxf2 were present in Nxf1
mRNA-containing ribonucleoprotein particles in cultured mouse neuronal
cells. Expression of Nxf2 led to destabilization of Nxf1 mRNA, and this
effect was abolished when Fmrp expression was reduced by small
interfering RNA. Zhang et al. (2007) concluded that FMRP and NXF2
collaborate to destabilize NXF1 mRNA.

MAPPING

Using genomic sequence analysis, Herold et al. (2000) mapped the NXF1
gene to chromosome 11 and determined that it contains at least 21 exons.
Hamilton et al. (1997) mapped the Mvb1 locus to proximal mouse
chromosome 19.

Windpassinger et al. (2003) observed that Human Genome Project sequence
data indicated that the NXF1 gene is located on 11q12-q14, the region to
which the locus for Silver spastic paraplegia syndrome (270685) had been
mapped. They excluded NXF1 as the mutant gene, as no mutations were
found on sequence analysis of at least 2 affected individuals from each
of 4 different families and 1 healthy control.

ANIMAL MODEL

In mice, the modifier-of-vibrator-1 locus (Mvb1) controls levels of
correctly processed mRNA from genes mutated by endogenous retrovirus
insertions into introns, including the Pitpn(vb) (600174) tremor
mutation and the Eya1(BOR) (601653) model of human branchiootorenal
syndrome. By positional complementation cloning, Floyd et al. (2003)
identified Mvb1 as the nuclear export factor Nxf1, providing an
unexpected link between the mRNA export receptor and pre-mRNA
processing. Population structure of the suppressive allele in wild Mus
musculus castaneus suggested selective advantage.

;;CD3 ANTIGEN, ZETA SUBUNIT; CD3Z;;

T-CELL ANTIGEN RECEPTOR COMPLEX, ZETA SUBUNIT OF CD3; TCRZ
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Weissman et al. (1986) used an antiserum raised against the mouse zeta
subunit of the T-cell antigen receptor to identify a previously
unrecognized component of the human T-cell antigen receptor. This human
protein is T-cell specific and biochemically similar to the murine zeta
polypeptide, which has a molecular weight of 16K. The zeta chain, which,
like the epsilon chain, is nonglycosylated, exists in the T-cell
receptor molecule as a disulfide-linked homodimer.

Weissman et al. (1988) cloned a cDNA encoding the zeta chain of the
murine T-cell antigen receptor. The predicted protein sequence suggested
a structure distinct from those of any of the previously described
receptor subunits.

As indicated by Clevers et al. (1988), the T-cell receptor alpha/beta
and gamma/delta heterodimers are noncovalently associated with the
CD3-gamma (186740), -delta (186790), -epsilon (186830), and -zeta
proteins, together forming the T-cell receptor-CD3 complex. Weissman et
al. (1988) used the cDNA for the murine zeta gene as a probe to isolate
cDNAs encoding the human CD3Z gene. Comparison of the human and murine
genes showed a high degree of conservation, including conservation in
the nucleotide sequence of the 5-prime and 3-prime untranslated regions.
No significant sequence and structural homology was found, however, with
the previously characterized invariant delta, gamma, and epsilon chains
of the T-cell receptor.

GENE FUNCTION

The zeta chain of the T-cell antigen receptor plays an important role in
coupling antigen recognition to several intracellular
signal-transduction pathways. Caplan et al. (1995) presented evidence
that the zeta chain, while expressed on the T-cell surface, is
associated with the cytoskeletal matrix. A 42-amino acid region in the
intracytoplasmic domain of the zeta chain proved crucial for maximal
interaction between zeta chain and the cytoskeleton.

CD4 (186940) binds to relatively invariant sites on class II major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules outside the peptide-binding
groove, which interacts with the T-cell receptor (TCR). CD4 enhances
T-cell sensitivity to antigen and binds to LCK (153390), which
phosphorylates CD3Z. Instead of clustering in a cap at the interface
with an antigen-presenting cell (APC), some signaling molecules involved
in T-cell recognition segregate into distinct areas to form a SMAC
(supramolecular activation cluster), contributing to the immunologic
synapse (see Grakoui et al. (1999)). Using T-cell lines transfected with
green fluorescent protein-fused CD4 or CD3Z and 3-dimensional video
microscopy, Krummel et al. (2000) showed that in response to
peptide-loaded APC, CD3Z and CD4 initially cluster in the contact area
between the T cell and APC coincident with intracellular calcium
mobilization. Stable immunologic synapse formation was modulated by
peptide concentration and compromised by blocking the calcium increase
or cytoskeletal rearrangement. The authors determined that CD3Z remains
at the center of the interface while CD4 moves to the periphery.
Blocking with anti-TCR prevented CD3Z accumulation and inhibited calcium
mobilization. The data suggested that instead of stabilizing TCR-MHC
complexes, CD4 functions to initiate or augment the early phase of
T-cell activation.

MAPPING

The CD3Z gene was localized by Weissman et al. (1988) to the centromeric
region of chromosome 1 by study of somatic cell hybrids and by in situ
hybridization, emphasizing the fact that it is a distinct genetic
component of the T-cell receptor (the CD3D, CD3G, and CD3E genes are
clustered within 300 kb of each other on 11q23). The gene was assigned
to 1p22.1-q21.1. Baniyash et al. (1989) mapped the homologous gene in
the mouse to chromosome 1. Sturm et al. (1995) mapped the human OTF1
gene (164175) to 1q22-q23 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The
physical linkage of the CD3Z gene to the OTF1 transcription unit
indicates that CD3Z is also located at 1q22-q23.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Rieux-Laucat et al. (2006) described a 4-month-old boy with primary
T-cell immunodeficiency (610163) who was found to have a homozygous
germline Q70X mutation in the CD3Z gene (186780.0001). CD3-zeta is
necessary for the development and function of T cells. Some of the
patient's T cells had low levels of the T-cell receptor-CD3 complex and
carried the Q70X mutation on both alleles of the CD3Z gene, whereas
other T cells had normal levels of the complex and bore the Q70X
mutation on only 1 allele of CD3Z, plus 1 of 3 heterozygous somatic
mutations of CD3Z on the other allele (186780.0002-186780.0004),
allowing expression of poorly functional T-cell receptor-CD3 complexes.
Thus the patient had both inherited and somatic CD3Z mutations as the
basis of the T-cell deficiency.

Rieux-Laucat et al. (2006) noted that the finding of somatic mutations
of a germline mutation in the CD3Z gene recalled somatic mutations of
germline mutations of the adenosine deaminase gene (608958), the
interleukin-2 receptor gamma-c gene (IL2RG; 308380), the
recombination-activating gene-1 (RAG1; 179615), the Wiskott-Aldrich
syndrome protein (301000), and the NEMO gene (300248). These somatic
changes could cause the mutant gene to revert to a wildtype gene or to a
sequence compatible with expression of the corresponding protein. In the
patient of Rieux-Laucat et al. (2006), these somatic mutations occurring
in the initially mutated codon were probably not due to a mutation
hotspot related to genomic instability, since these variants were not
found in other cell types from the patient. Furthermore, the T cells
with normal levels of the T-cell receptor-CD3 complex were polyclonal,
and each of the 3 somatic variants of CD3Z was found in different
populations of T cells, each with a distinct rearrangement of V(beta)
genes. This result indicated that the somatic mutations in CD3Z probably
occurred before the VDJ recombination process in T-cell progenitors. The
somatic mutations partially corrected the CD3Z deficiency, providing an
example of the modulation of T-cell immunodeficiency by somatic
mutations and of the selection of clones with such mutations.

ANIMAL MODEL

Class I MHC molecules, known to be important for immune responses to
antigen, are expressed also by neurons that undergo activity-dependent,
long-term structural and synaptic modifications. Huh et al. (2000)
showed that in mice genetically deficient for cell surface class I MHC,
due to deletion of either TAP1 (170260) or beta-2-microglobulin
(109700), or for the class I MHC receptor component CD3Z, refinement of
connections between retina and central targets during development is
incomplete. In the hippocampus of adult mutants, N-methyl-D-aspartate
receptor-dependent long-term potentiation is enhanced, and long-term
depression is absent. Specific class I MHC mRNAs are expressed by
distinct mosaics of neurons, reflecting a potential for diverse neuronal
functions. These results demonstrated an important role for these
molecules in the activity-dependent remodeling and plasticity of
connections in the developing and mature mammalian central nervous
system.

In mice chronically exposed to antigens of Porphyromonas gingivalis,
Bronstein-Sitton et al. (2003) observed that Ifng (147570)-dependent
Tcrz downregulation, due to lysosomal degradation, and impaired in vitro
T-cell function occurred in a way similar to that reported in a number
of infectious, autoimmune, and cancer pathologies. The in vitro findings
correlated with a deficient in vivo response, as assessed by reduced
immunity to influenza virus infection. Normal immune function and Tcrz
expression were regained after the cessation of chronic antigen
exposure.

By in situ hybridization of wildtype mouse retina, Xu et al. (2010)
showed that Cd3-zeta was preferentially expressed in the retinal
ganglion cell (RGC) layer. In Cd3-zeta -/- mice, the kinetics of RGC
dendritic elimination was markedly reduced, and the number of dendritic
protrusions was significantly increased during early postnatal
development. These defects could be mimicked in wildtype mice by
applying glutamate receptor (GLUR; see 138248) antagonists. Disruption
of RGC synaptic activity and dendritic motility was associated with a
failure of eye-specific segregation of RGC axon projections to the
central nervous system. Xu et al. (2010) concluded that CD3-zeta
regulates synaptic wiring and selectively impairs GLUR-mediated synaptic
activity in retina during development.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
IMMUNODEFICIENCY DUE TO DEFECT IN CD3-ZETA
CD247, GLN70TER

In a 4-month-old boy of Caribbean origin with primary T-cell
immunodeficiency (610163), Rieux-Laucat et al. (2006) identified
homozygosity for a gln70-to-stop (Q70X) nonsense mutation in the CD3Z
gene. The premature stop codon was located within the first ITAM domain,
immediately upstream from the first YXXL motif, precluding expression of
all ITAM motifs and thus any interaction with the tyrosine kinase ZAP70
(176947). The boy's mother was heterozygous for the Q70X mutation. The
patient's other T cells had normal levels of the CD3 complex and bore
the Q70X mutation on only 1 allele of CD3Z, plus 1 of 3 heterozygous
somatic mutations of CD3Z on the other allele, allowing expression of
poorly functional T-cell receptor-CD3 complexes. The heterozygous
somatic mutations of CD3Z were Q70W (186780.0002), Q70L (186780), and
Q70Y (186780).

for the Q70X mutation in combination with 1 of 3 somatic mutations,
