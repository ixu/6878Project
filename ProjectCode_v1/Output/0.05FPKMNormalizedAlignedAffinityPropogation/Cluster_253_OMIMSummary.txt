DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing cDNAs randomly selected from a cDNA library derived from
the human immature myeloid cell line KG-1, Nagase et al. (1995) isolated
a cDNA encoding MESDC2, which they designated KIAA0081. The predicted
233-amino acid protein contains at least 1 putative transmembrane
region. Northern blot analysis detected expression in all tissues tested
except peripheral blood leukocytes.

Wines et al. (2001) cloned mouse Mesdc2, which encodes a 223-amino acid
protein that shares 82% identity with the 234-amino acid human protein.
MESDC2 was predicted to have an N-terminal transmembrane domain.
Northern blot analysis detected a 1.8-kb transcript in mouse embryos
throughout development and in all adult mouse tissues tested, except
skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Hsieh et al. (2003) demonstrated that Mesdc2, a gene identified in the
mesoderm development (Mesd) deletion interval on mouse chromosome 7, is
essential for specification of embryonic polarity and mesoderm
induction. They determined that the patterning and cell differentiation
defects observed in Mesd deletion homozygotes result solely from loss of
the Mesdc2 gene, and therefore they renamed the gene Mesd. Hsieh et al.
(2003) showed that Mesd functions in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as a
specific chaperone for Lrp5 (603506) and Lrp6 (603507), which in
conjunction with frizzled (see 603408) are coreceptors for canonical Wnt
signal transduction. The authors proposed that disruption of embryonic
polarity and mesoderm differentiation in Mesd-deficient embryos likely
results from a primary defect in Wnt signaling. However, phenotypic
differences between Mesd-deficient and Wnt3 (165330) -/- embryos
suggested that Mesd may function on related members of the LDLR family.
LDLR family members mediate diverse cellular processes ranging from
cargo transport to signaling.

Culi and Mann (2003) described boca, an evolutionarily conserved gene in
Drosophila melanogaster that encodes an ER protein homologous to the
mouse Mesdc2 protein. They showed that boca is specifically required for
the intracellular trafficking of members of the LDLR family. Two LDLRs
in flies, arrow (see 603507), which is required for wingless signal
transduction, and yolkless, which is required for yolk protein uptake
during oogenesis, were found to require boca function. Culi and Mann
(2003) concluded that boca is an essential component of the wingless
pathway but is more generally required for the activities of multiple
LDLR family members.

Veltman et al. (2005) identified a patient with an infantile
sacrococcygeal teratoma and a constitutional t(12;15)(q13;q25)
chromosomal translocation, resulting SENP1 (612157)/MESDC2 fusion gene.
Both reciprocal SENP1/MESDC2 (SEME) and MESDC2/SENP1 (MESE) fusion genes
were transcribed in tumor-derived cells, and their open reading frames
encoded aberrant proteins. In contrast to wildtype MESDC2, the
translocation-associated SEME protein was no longer targeted to the
endoplasmic reticulum, leading to a presumed loss-of-function as a
chaperone for the WNT coreceptors LRP5 (603506) and/or LRP6 (603507).
SUMO, a posttranslational modifier, plays an important role in several
cellular key processes and is cleaved from its substrates by wildtype
SENP1. In vitro studies revealed that translocation-associated MESE
proteins exhibited desumoylation capacities similar to those observed
for wildtype SENP1. Veltman et al. (2005) speculated that spatiotemporal
disturbances in desumoylating activities during critical stages of
embryonic development might be responsible for teratoma formation. The
constitutional t(12;15)(q13;q25) translocation suggested SENP1 and
MESDC2 as candidate genes for neonatal/infantile germ cell tumor
development.

MAPPING

Nagase et al. (1995) mapped the MESDC2 gene to chromosome 15 by analysis
of human-rodent hybrid cell lines.

By radiation hybrid analysis and sequencing a BAC contig, Wines et al.
(2001) mapped the MESCD2 gene to chromosome 15q23-q25. They mapped the
mouse Mesdc2 gene to a region of chromosome 7 that shares homology of
synteny with human chromosome 15q23-q25.

Veltman et al. (2005) stated that the MESDC2 gene maps to chromosome
15q25.

ANIMAL MODEL

Wines et al. (2001) identified Mesdc2 within a region of mouse
chromosome 7 that, when deleted, results in failure to form mesoderm and
embryonic lethality.

ALP;;
KIAA1709
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for genes in a region of chromosome 11 associated with WAGR
syndrome (194072), Gawin et al. (1999) identified and cloned NAT10,
which they designated clone 193700. Northern blot analysis detected
variable expression of a 4.5-kb transcript in all human tissues
examined, with highest expression in heart, brain, placenta, and
pancreas.

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned KIAA1709. The deduced protein
contains 1,028 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA detected high expression in
liver and intermediate expression in all other adult and fetal tissues
and specific adult brain regions examined.

By yeast 1-hybrid screening of a HeLa cell cDNA library using the
promoter region of the catalytic subunit of human telomerase, TERT
(187270), as bait, followed by 5-prime RACE, Lv et al. (2003) cloned
ALP. The deduced 834-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass
of 94 kD. ALP contains an N-acetyltransferase domain accompanied by an
ATP/GTP-binding motif and an ATPase domain. Western blot analysis of
HeLa cells detected ALP at an apparent molecular mass of 94 kD.
Immunocytochemical analysis detected ALP mainly in HeLa cell nuclei.

GENE FUNCTION

By in vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assay, Lv et al. (2003)
confirmed that ALP interacts with the TERT promoter. Cotransfection of
HeLa cells with a reporter construct driven by the TERT promoter and ALP
cDNA resulted in increased reporter activity. Cotransfection of the
reporter with antisense ALP cDNA resulted decreased reporter activity.
Cells overexpressing ALP showed higher telomerase activity, whereas
cells with antisense ALP showed decreased telomerase activity. In vitro
analysis showed that ALP specifically catalyzed acetylation of histones.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lv et al. (2003) determined that the ALP gene contains 24 exons and
spans about 33 kb.

MAPPING

By analyzing a PAC contig covering chromosome 11p14.1-p13, Gawin et al.
(1999) mapped the NAT10 gene to chromosome 11p13, centromeric to the
GPIAP1 gene (601178) and telomeric to the CAT gene (115500).

By genomic sequence analysis, Lv et al. (2003) mapped the ALP gene to
chromosome 11p13.

609360	TITLE *609360 RENALASE; RNLS
;;CHROMOSOME 10 OPEN READING FRAME 59; C10ORF59
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Renalase is a flavin adenine dinucleotide-dependent amine oxidase that
is secreted into the blood from the kidney (Xu et al., 2005).

CLONING

By searching databases for transcripts likely to encode proteins
secreted from the kidney, Xu et al. (2005) identified a cDNA clone
encoding renalase. The deduced 342-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 37.8 kD. Renalase contains an N-terminal signal
sequence and an amino oxidase domain. Northern blot analysis of several
tissues detected robust expression of a 1.5-kb transcript in kidney, and
lower expression in heart, skeletal muscle, and liver. A minor
transcript of about 2.4 kb was detected in skeletal muscle, and a minor
transcript of 1.2 kb was detected in kidney and liver. In situ
hybridization detected renalase in renal glomeruli and proximal tubules,
and in cardiomyocytes. Western blot analysis detected renalase at an
apparent molecular mass of about 35 kD in human urine. There was also a
signal at 67 to 75 kD, suggesting that the protein may form a doublet.
Renalase was also detected in the plasma of healthy individuals, but not
in the plasma of patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis.

GENE FUNCTION

Xu et al. (2005) demonstrated that epitope-tagged renalase was secreted
from transfected human embryonic kidney cells. Purified and recombinant
renalase metabolized catecholamines, with dopamine as the preferred
substrate, followed by epinephrine and norepinephrine. Within 30 seconds
of a single bolus injection of recombinant renalase into rats, systolic,
diastolic, and mean arterial pressure were decreased in a dose-dependent
manner. Renalase also decreased cardiac contractility and heart rate,
but peripheral vascular resistance was unchanged.

GENE STRUCTURE

Xu et al. (2005) determined that the renalase gene contains 9 exons and
spans about 311 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Xu et al. (2005) mapped the RNLS gene to
chromosome 10q23.33.

602688	TITLE *602688 HETEROGENEOUS NUCLEAR RIBONUCLEOPROTEIN A/B; HNRNPAB
;;APOLIPOPROTEIN B mRNA-EDITING ENZYME, CATALYTIC POLYPEPTIDE 1-BINDING
PROTEIN 1;;
APOBEC1-BINDING PROTEIN 1; ABBP1;;
HNRPAB
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Apolipoprotein B (APOB; 107730) mRNA editing is an intranuclear function
and is mediated by a multiprotein editosome complex (see APOBEC1;
600130). Using the yeast 2-hybrid system, Lau et al. (1997) identified
an APOBEC1-binding protein (ABBP1) that interacts with APOB mRNA. The
ABBP1 cDNA encodes a 331-amino acid protein that is identical to the
human type A/B heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) reported
by Khan et al. (1991), except for a 47-residue insertion in its
C-terminal region. Khan et al. (1991) identified the type A/B hnRNP as
an RNA-binding protein of unknown function in HeLa cells. Northern blot
analysis indicated that ABBP1 mRNA is distributed in multiple human
tissues as an approximately 2-kb transcript. The 47-amino acid insertion
of ABBP1 is encoded by an alternatively spliced exon.

GENE FUNCTION

Lau et al. (1997) found that ABBP1 contains typical RNP-type RNA-binding
motifs in its N-terminal half and glycine-rich motifs, which house the
APOBEC1-binding region, in its C-terminal region. ABBP1 binds to APOB
mRNA transcripts around the editing site and can be UV-crosslinked to
them. Editing is inhibited by ABBP1 immunodepletion or antisense ABBP1
cDNA transfection.

;;SAC DOMAIN-CONTAINING INOSITOL PHOSPHATASE 2; SAC2;;
KIAA0966
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned INPP5F, which they designated
KIAA0966. The transcript contains an Alu element in the 3-prime
untranslated region, and the deduced protein contains 1,132 amino acids.
RT-PCR ELISA detected moderate to high expression in all tissues
examined, with highest expression in whole adult brain, testis, and
ovary, and all specific adult brain regions examined. Whole fetal brain
expressed a somewhat lower level of expression than that found in the
adult brain.

By examining the INPP5F protein sequence, Minagawa et al. (2001)
identified 7 motifs conserved in SAC domain-containing proteins of
different species, including the active site Cx(5)R(T/S) motif in the
sixth motif. Northern blot analysis detected a 4.9-kb transcript in all
human tissues tested, with highest expression in brain, heart, skeletal
muscle, kidney, and placenta.

GENE FUNCTION

Minagawa et al. (2001) found that human INPP5F expressed in insect cells
showed 5-phosphatase activity against phosphatidylinositol
4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, similar to that of
type II phosphatases. It did not hydrolyze other inositol phosphates.
High activity was maintained between pH 5.5 and 8.0, with maximal
activity at pH 6.0. Activity was increased in the presence of Mg(2+) and
K+, but not Mn(2+), Ca(2+), or EDTA.

MAPPING

The Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the INPP5F gene to
chromosome 10 (TMAP WI-22037).

300462	TITLE *300462 A-KINASE ANCHOR PROTEIN 14; AKAP14
;;A-KINASE ANCHOR PROTEIN, 28-KD; AKAP28
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

A-kinase anchor proteins (AKAPs; see 602449) target protein kinase A
(PKA; see 176911) to discrete locations within the cell by binding the
regulatory subunit dimer of the PKA holoenzyme. AKAP28 is an axonemal
AKAP.

CLONING

Kultgen et al. (2002) identified AKAP28 as an axoneme-enriched PKA type
II regulatory subunit (RII)-binding protein by overlay analysis of
isolated cilia from well-differentiated human bronchial epithelial
(WD-HBE) cells. By screening a WD-HBE cDNA expression library using RII
as probe, followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE and database analysis,
Kultgen et al. (2002) obtained a full-length cDNA encoding AKAP28. The
deduced AKAP28 protein contains 197 amino acids and has an apparent
molecular mass of 28 kD. By database analysis, Kultgen et al. (2002)
determined that there are at least 3 AKAP28 splice variants, and RT-PCR
detected all 3 variants in trachea and testis. Northern blot analysis of
HBE cells detected upregulation of a 0.8-kb AKAP28 transcript as cells
differentiated and began to display a mucociliary phenotype. Northern
blot analysis of a multiple-tissue array showed predominant expression
of AKAP28 in trachea and testis, the only tissues examined that contain
axoneme-based organelles. Faint expression was also detected in adult
and fetal lung. Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry localized
AKAP28 to airway cilia.

GENE FUNCTION

By mutation analysis, Kultgen et al. (2002) confirmed that amino acids
35 to 52 of AKAP28 mediate binding of RII. Coimmunoprecipitation
analysis showed that recombinant AKAP28 associated with RII and the PKA
catalytic subunit, but not with RI, in HeLa cells. When heterologously
expressed in a cervical adenocarcinoma cell line, AKAP28 preferentially
bound type II PKA and was able to copurify with the PKA catalytic
subunit. Kultgen et al. (2002) concluded that AKAP28 acts as a type II
PKA anchor within cells.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Kultgen et al. (2002) mapped the AKAP28
gene to chromosome Xq24.

;;cAMP PHOSPHODIESTERASE, ADIPOCYTE, cGMP-INHIBITED;;
HcGIP1, RAT, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are a superfamily of related
enzymes involved in many regulatory pathways. The PDE3 family is
characterized by high affinity for cAMP, inhibition by cGMP, sensitivity
to specific inhibitors such as cilostamide and milrinone, and by
phosphorylation and activation in response to insulin and agents that
increase cAMP. Miki et al. (1996) used a rat PDE3B cDNA to screen a
human fat cDNA library. They assembled a complete PDE3B cDNA coding
sequence by assembling partial cDNA clones, genomic clones, and PCR
products. This coding sequence predicts a protein of 1,112 amino acids
with 81% amino acid identity with rat PDE3B. Northern blot analysis
showed low levels of PDE3B expression in liver, spleen, lung, and
kidney, and abundant 5.4- and 6.4-kb transcripts in adipose tissue from
several locations. Lobbert et al. (1996) also isolated cDNAs of human
PDE3B and reported similar findings.

GENE FUNCTION

Using male Sprague-Dawley rats implanted with third
intracerebroventricular cannulae, Zhao et al. (2002) found that
cilostamide, a PDE3B inhibitor, reversed the established effects of
leptin (164160) on food intake and body weight; blocked, at the
hypothalamic level, the leptin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of
signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3; 102582); and
blocked the DNA binding of STAT3 protein. In addition, Zhao et al.
(2002) showed that intracerebroventricular administration of leptin
increased hypothalamic phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K; see 601232)
and PDE3B activities and decreased cAMP concentration. Zhao et al.
(2002) concluded that a PI3K-PDE3B-cAMP pathway interacting with the
JAK2 (147796)-STAT3 pathway constitutes a critical component of leptin
signaling in the hypothalamus.

Regulatory CD4-positive T cells, or Tr cells, prevent self-destructive
immune responses, and their development is critically dependent on FOXP3
(300292). Gavin et al. (2007) studied mouse T cells that actively
transcribed a Foxp3-null allele, but lacked Foxp3 protein. Using flow
cytometric and microarray analyses, they found that, although Foxp3
function was required for Tr suppressor cell activity, Foxp3 largely
amplified and fixed preexisting molecular features of Tr cells.
Furthermore, Foxp3 solidified Tr-cell lineage stability by modifying
cell surface and signaling molecules, including Foxp3-dependent
repression of Pde3b. Introduction of Pde3b into Tr cells and transfer of
these cells to T-cell-deficient mice substantially reduced the number of
Tr cells. Gavin et al. (2007) proposed that reduced PDE3B expression may
be a unique marker of Tr cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Miki et al. (1996) isolated and analyzed genomic clones of human PDE3B.
They found that the PDE3B gene was encoded on 16 exons spanning 114 kb.

MAPPING

Miki et al. (1996) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to localize
the human PDE3B gene to chromosome 11p15. Lobbert et al. (1996)
sublocalized this mapping to 11p15.1-p15.2 using a PCR mapping panel.
They noted evidence suggesting that this chromosomal area harbors genes
involved in obesity and noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Miki et al. (1996) noted the existence of a G/A polymorphism in the
coding region of the PDE3B gene and polymorphic dinucleotide repeats in
2 of the introns.

ANIMAL MODEL

Choi et al. (2006) found that newborn Pde3b-knockout mice exhibited no
obvious physical defects, and their growth, development, behavior, and
fertility appeared normal. Pde3b-knockout mice were slightly heavier
than controls, and they exhibited variations in coat color from white to
yellowish brown. The weight of gonadal adipose tissue was lower in
knockout than wildtype mice, and the mean cell diameter of knockout
adipocytes was smaller than normal. Triglyceride content was
significantly increased in livers of knockout mice and was associated
with increased expression of fatty acid synthase (FASN; 600212).
Pde3b-knockout mice exhibited multiple alterations in regulation of
lipolysis, lipogenesis, and insulin secretion, as well as signs of
peripheral insulin resistance.

NOMENCLATURE

This gene has been referred to as PDE3A. However, it has been assigned
the symbol PDE3B by GDB/HUGO. The symbol PDE3A has been assigned to
myocardial cGMP-inhibited cAMP phosphodiesterase (123805).

611217	TITLE *611217 PRADER-WILLI REGION NONCODING RNA 2; PWRN2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for genes in the Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS; 176270) region
on chromosome 15, followed by database analysis and RT-PCR of testis,
Buiting et al. (2007) obtained several PWRN2 transcripts. The
transcripts differed due to alternative splicing and polyadenylation,
and all appeared to be noncoding. RT-PCR detected PWRN2 expression in
testis only.

GENE STRUCTURE

Buiting et al. (2007) determined that the PWRN2 gene contains 3 exons
and spans 7.2 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Buiting et al. (2007) mapped the PWRN2
gene to chromosome 15q11-q13. In addition to the expressed gene, this
region contains 5 partial duplications of PWRN2.

;;SPA1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Hattori et al. (1995) cloned the mouse Spa1 gene based on its inducible
expression in lymphoid cells stimulated with interleukin-2 (147680).

Kurachi et al. (1997) cloned the human SPA1 gene. The gene encodes a
1,042-amino acid polypeptide with a predicted mass of 130 kD. The
protein contains a C-terminal leucine zipper motif and an N-terminal
GTPase activating protein (GAP) domain homologous to the human RAP1GAP
(600278) protein. Human and mouse Spa1 amino acid sequences are 90%
identical, with their GAP domains 98% identical. Human SPA1 was
expressed at high levels in lymphohematopoietic tissues and at lower
levels in several other tissues. The authors noted that SPA1 and RAP1GAP
appeared to have nearly segregate expression patterns. The human SPA1
protein was localized to the perinuclear region.

GENE FUNCTION

Hattori et al. (1995) showed that mouse Spa1 hampers mitogen-induced
cell cycle progression when abnormally or prematurely expressed.

Kurachi et al. (1997) stated that SPA1 colocalized with the RAP1
(179520) and RAP2 (179540) proteins and activated these GTPases.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wada et al. (1997) cloned the mouse genomic Sipa1 gene and found that it
consists of 16 exons.

Ebrahimi et al. (1998) studied the organization of the human SIPA1 gene.

MAPPING

Wada et al. (1997) used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to map
the human SIPA1 gene to chromosome 11q13.3. Using 2-color FISH, they
determined that the human SIPA1 locus is centromeric to the CCND1
(168461) locus.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hunter et al. (2001) identified a probable metastasis efficiency locus,
called Mtes1, on proximal mouse chromosome 19 (Hunter et al., 2001) in a
10-Mb region orthologous to human 11q12-q13. To identify potential
candidates for underlying Mtes1, Park et al. (2002) used multiple cross
and inbred strain haplotype mapping of the Mtes1 locus in 2 mouse
strains with high metastatic efficiency and 2 with low metastatic
efficiency, which reduced the number of high-priority candidate genes
from about 500 to 23, a more tractable number for further
characterization. Park et al. (2005), using a combination of
bioinformatics, sequence analysis, and in vitro and in vivo experiments,
identified the signal-induced proliferation-associated gene-1 (Sipa1) as
a strong candidate for underlying the Mtes1 locus. The gene was found to
contain a nonsynonymous amino acid polymorphism that affected its Sipa1
Rap-GAP function. Spontaneous metastasis assays using cells ectopically
expressing Sipa1 or cells with knocked-down Sipa1 expression showed that
metastatic capacity was correlated with cellular Sipa1 levels. They also
found that human expression data were consistent with the idea that
Sipa1 concentration has a role in metastasis. Park et al. (2005) stated
that, to their knowledge, this was the first demonstration of a
constitutional genetic polymorphism affecting tumor metastasis.

Ishida et al. (2006) found that Spa1 -/- mice had an age-dependent
increase in B220 (PTPRC; 151460)-expressing B1a lymphocytes producing
anti-double-stranded DNA antibody, an altered variable kappa isotype
repertoire, and lupus-like nephritis. Ishida et al. (2006) proposed that
regulated RAP1 signaling in immature B cells plays a role in modifying
the B-cell repertoire and in maintaining self-tolerance.

602207	TITLE *602207 RAS-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN RAB18; RAB18
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Rab proteins are members of a family of Ras-related small GTPases that
regulate membrane trafficking in organelles and transport vesicles.

CLONING

By stimulating umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) with histamine
and differential display gene expression analysis, Schafer et al. (2000)
isolated a cDNA encoding RAB18. The deduced 206-amino acid protein
shares 98%, 92%, and 85% identity with the mouse, snail, and worm
sequences, respectively. RAB18 contains totally conserved
phosphate/Mg(2+)-binding motifs and guanine-binding motifs as well as
somewhat variable organelle-targeting regions. Northern blot analysis
detected 2.5- and 1.0-kb transcripts in endothelial cells but not in
smooth muscle cells or leukocytes. RT-PCR analysis suggested ubiquitous
expression, which HPLC analysis determined to be strongest in heart,
kidney, pancreas, lung, and liver, with weak expression in brain,
placenta, and skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Schafer et al. (2000) reported that stimulation of polarized HUVEC or
nonpolarized mononuclear cells with histamine showed a significant time-
and dose-dependent increase of RAB18 transcript in both cell types,
suggesting a possible role for Rab proteins in inflammation.

MAPPING

McMurtrie et al. (1997) mapped the mouse Rab18 gene to chromosome 18.

Hartz (2009) mapped the RAB18 gene to chromosome 10p12.1 based on an
alignment of the RAB18 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AA216667) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 5 large consanguineous families, 4 Pakistani and
1 Turkish, segregating Warburg Micro syndrome (WARBM3; 614222), Bem et
al. (2011) identified homozygous loss-of-function mutations in the RAB18
gene (602207.0001 and 602207.0002, respectively). Direct sequencing for
RAB18 mutations in 58 additional families segregating Warburg Micro
syndrome detected compound heterozygous mutations
(602207.0003-602207.0004) in affected sibs of 1 family. Bem et al.
(2011) performed nucleotide-binding assays and showed that although
RAB18 bound GDP and GTP comparably to other RABs (RAB5A, 179512; RAB35,
604199), the RAB18 L24Q (602207.0001) and R93del (602207.0003) mutant
proteins did not bind detectable levels of either GDP or GTP and are
therefore functionally null. Bem et al. (2011) noted that the
pathogenicity of these mutations could be explained by their lack of
guanosine nucleotide binding because, as for other RAB proteins, this is
a prerequisite for correct subcellular localization and function.

ANIMAL MODEL

Bem et al. (2011) investigated the effect of knockdown of rab18 in
zebrafish to establish whether rab18 has a conserved role in brain and
eye development. The most common abnormalities observed at 3 days
post-fertilization in both the rab18a and rab18b morphants were
microphthalmia, microcephaly, pericardial edema, delayed jaw formation,
a reduced overall body size, and a general developmental delay. Further
characterization of the rab18b eye phenotype revealed that the rab18b
morphants had delayed retinal development and abnormal retinal
lamination, residual nucleated lens fiber cells, widely open choroid
fissure, and microphthalmia at day 3. To assess the specificity of the
rab18b phenotype, Bem et al. (2011) conducted a rescue experiment by
synthesizing rab18b mRNA. Partial rescue of the eye defects, pericardial
edema, and overall developmental delay was observed at 3 days.

RAB18, LEU24GLN

In affected members of 4 large consanguineous Pakistani families
segregating Warburg Micro syndrome-3 (614222), Bem et al. (2011)

transition resulting in a leu24-to-gln (L24Q) substitution.

In 2 affected sibs in a consanguineous Turkish family segregating
Warburg Micro syndrome-3 (614222), Bem et al. (2011) identified a
homozygous exon 2 deletion predicted to result in a frameshift. The
parents were heterozygous for the deletion.

.0003
WARBURG MICRO SYNDROME 3
RAB18, 3-BP DEL, NT277

In affected members of a family segregating Warburg Micro syndrome-3
(614222), Bem et al. (2011) identified compound heterozygous mutations
in the RAB18 gene: a 3-bp deletion (277_279del) resulting in deletion of
arginine-93 (R93del), and an antitermination mutation, a 619T-C
transition resulting in a ter207-to-gln (X207Q; 602207.0004)
substitution, predicted to extend RAB18 by 20 amino acids (X207QextX20)
and thus abolish C-terminal prenylation and membrane targeting.

;;MIXED-LINEAGE KINASE 2; MLK2;;
MKN28 KINASE;;
SERINE/THREONINE KINASE, MKN28-DERIVED, NONRECEPTOR-TYPE; MST
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Katoh et al. (1995) described the putative serine/threonine kinase
MAP3K10, which they isolated as a cDNA fragment from an MKN28 gastric
cancer cell library using degenerate PCR. Additional cDNAs of the gene,
which they called MST (MKN28-derived nonreceptor type of
serine/threonine kinase), were isolated from a brain library. MST
encodes a predicted 953-amino acid protein with a Src homology (SH3)
domain, 2 leucine zipper domains, and a proline-rich domain. Northern
blot analysis showed that the gene is moderately expressed in brain,
skeletal muscle, and testis as a 3.8-kb mRNA.

By screening a human colonic cDNA library, Dorow et al. (1993)
identified a partial clone representing MAP3K10, which they called MLK2.
With the exception of a short C-terminal peptide, the MLK2 clone shares
75% predicted amino acid identity with MLK1 (600136). The 2 sequences
are also identical with respect to the distinctive features and spatial
arrangement of the catalytic domain motifs. Dorow et al. (1995) isolated
a full-length MAP3K10 cDNA from a brain cDNA library. The deduced
954-amino acid protein contains an SH3 domain, a kinase catalytic
domain, a double leucine zipper and basic domain, and a large C-terminal
domain. Northern blot analysis detected a single 3.8-kb transcript with
highest expression in brain and skeletal muscle, and lower expression in
pancreas.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, Katoh et al. (1995) mapped the MAP3K10 gene to
19q13.1-q13.2. By FISH, Dorow et al. (1995) localized the gene to
19q13.2.

;;PRP4, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The Prp4 gene of Schizosaccharomyces pombe encodes a protein kinase that
appears to be involved in pre-mRNA splicing (Gross et al., 1997). Based
on kinase domain sequence, Prp4 belongs to the Clk (CDC-like kinase)
family. Using a PCR approach, Gross et al. (1997) identified human and
mouse Prp4 homologs. The human and mouse amino acid sequences are 98%
identical, and the mammalian sequence shared 44% identity with that of
the S. pombe protein. Gross et al. (1997) demonstrated that Prp4 and a
recombinant fusion protein consisting of the yeast N terminus with the
mouse kinase domain phosphorylated the human arginine/serine-rich
splicing factor SFRS2 (600813) in vitro.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PRP4
gene to chromosome 6 (TMAP WI-6524).

;;MLP;;
MARCKS-RELATED PROTEIN; MRP;;
MAC-MARCKS;;
F52
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Umekage and Kato (1991) identified a cDNA with homology to MARCKS
(PKCSL; 177061) among mouse brain cDNAs with specific brain expression
patterns. The myristoylated, alanine-rich protein MARCKS is a widely
expressed, prominent substrate for protein kinase C (see 176960), a key
enzyme of intracellular signal transduction. The predicted 200-amino
acid protein, which they called F52, shares 52% amino acid identity with
bovine MARCKS. The similarity between the 2 proteins is found in the
consensus myristoylation sequence near the N-terminus and in the
25-amino acid protein kinase C phosphorylation site domain. F52 has a
similar amino acid composition to MARCKS, although its alanine content
is not as high. It is distributed throughout the mouse brain in a
pattern that is distinct from that of MARCKS.

By screening a genomic library with portions of the Mrp cDNA, Stumpo et
al. (1998) isolated the human homolog, which they designated MLP for
'MARCKS-like protein.' They reported that the sequences of the mouse and
human promoters were 71% identical over 433 bp. A transgene containing
this 433-bp fragment from mouse linked to a reporter Mrp
beta-galactosidase gene produced normal patterns of Mrp expression in
the developing mouse embryo.

Using Northern hybridization, Lobach et al. (1993) observed Mrp
expression in various mouse tissues, with highest levels in testis and
uterus.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lobach et al. (1993) reported that the mouse F52, or Mrp, gene contains
a single intron at a position exactly analogous to that of the single
intron in mouse, cow, and human MARCKS.

MAPPING

By analysis of an interspecific backcross, Lobach et al. (1993) mapped
the Mrp gene to a position on mouse chromosome 4 that was closely linked
to the Lck (153390) locus. Based on homology of synteny, they predicted
that the human homolog would map to chromosome 1p35-p32. Using somatic
cell hybrid analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization, Stumpo et
al. (1998) confirmed that the human MLP gene maps to 1p34.

ANIMAL MODEL

Wu et al. (1996) used gene targeting to generate Mrp-deficient mice.
They observed severe neural tube defects (NTD) including exencephaly,
spina bifida, and tail flexion anomaly in approximately 60% of the
homozygous mutants and in approximately 10% of heterozygous animals. The
homozygous mutants without exencephaly survived despite brain
abnormalities, which appear to occur secondarily to the NTD. Wu et al.
(1996) suggested that mutations in Mrp result in isolated NTD and
therefore may provide an animal model for common human NTD.

;;KERATIN, HAIR, BASIC, 1; KRTHB1;;
KERATIN, HARD, TYPE II, 1; HB1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

See KRTHA1 (601077) for general information on hair keratins.

CLONING

By screening a human scalp cDNA library with a mouse Hb4 (see 602766)
cDNA, Rogers et al. (1995) isolated a cDNA encoding KRTHB1, or HB1. The
predicted 495-amino acid HB1 protein has an 88-amino acid C-terminal
domain. The amino acid sequences of human and sheep HB1 are 90%
identical. Northern blot analysis detected HB1 transcripts in human
scalp but not unhaired breast epidermis.

Rogers et al. (1997) found that the amino acid sequences of HB1, HB3
(602765), HB5 (602767), and HB6 are highly conserved, with the
similarity extending beyond the alpha-helical region into the N-terminal
and proximal C-terminal domains. HB1 is more closely related to HB3 and
HB6 than to HB5. In situ hybridization studies demonstrated that type II
keratin genes are sequentially activated in the hair follicle in the
following order: HB5--(HB1, HB3)--HB6. Both HB1 and HB3 mRNA syntheses
begin 10 to 15 cell layers above the apex of the dermal papilla and end
abruptly in the middle of the cortex.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bowden et al. (1998) determined the complete genomic sequence of HB1.
The HB1 gene has 9 exons and spans about 5.6 kb from the translational
initiation ATG codon to the poly(A) site. Its upstream regulatory
sequences contain a LEF1 (153245)-binding site, which is found is other
hair keratin genes. The HB1 gene is located about 10 kb from the HB6
(601928) gene.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Rogers et al. (1995) and Bowden
et al. (1998) mapped the HB1 gene to 12q13.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Monilethrix (158000) is a rare dominant hair disease characterized by
beaded or moniliform hair that results from the periodic thinning of the
hair shaft and shows a high propensity to excess weathering and
fracturing. Several monilethrix families have been linked to the type II
keratin gene cluster on 12q13, and causative heterozygous mutations of
highly conserved glutamic acid residues, glu413 to lys (601928.0001) and
glu413 to asp (601928.0002), in the helix termination motif of the type
II hair keratin HB6 have been identified. Winter et al. (1997)
investigated 2 unrelated monilethrix families. Whereas affected members
of 1 family and another single unrelated patient exhibited the
glu413-to-lys mutation in HB6, the second family showed a lysine
substitution of the corresponding glutamic acid residue, glu413
(602153.0001), in the type II hair keratin HB1, suggesting that this
site represents a mutation hotspot in these highly related type II hair
keratins. Both HB1 and HB6 are largely coexpressed in cortical
trichocytes of the hair shaft. Winter et al. (1997) concluded that
monilethrix is a disease of the hair cortex.

MONILETHRIX
KRT81, GLU413LYS

In both affected members of a 3-generation Canadian family with
monilethrix (158000), Winter et al. (1997) identified a G-to-A
transition in the HB1 gene product, resulting in a change of glutamic
acid to lysine at codon 413. The mutation was also detected in one
apparently unaffected individual.

This mutation was originally designated GLU403LYS because of a mistake
in the numbering of the amino acids of hair keratin HB1 between residues
305 and 325 (Rogers et al., 1995).

.0002
MONILETHRIX
KRT81, GLU402LYS

In a French family segregating monilethrix (158000), Winter et al.
(1998) found a lysine substitution of another highly conserved glutamic
acid residue, glu402, in the EIATYRRLLEGEE motif of HB1. Family members
bearing the glu402-to-lys mutation exhibited a particularly variable
disease phenotype. Affected members included 2 infants, 1 with
pronounced dystrophic alopecia, follicular keratosis, and clear-cut
moniliform hair, and 1 with no hair loss at all and moniliform hair
detectable only by electron microscopy. There was also an adult
individual without any clinically or electron microscopically detectable
signs, but with clear historical proof of the disease. Analysis of
'archival hairs' removed during childhood clearly demonstrated the
beaded hair type. Winter et al. (1998) believed that this was the first
demonstration of a moniliform hair phenotype in childhood with
improvement thereafter, becoming unidentifiable at a later age.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The CSF2RB gene encodes the high-affinity beta subunit of a receptor for
interleukin-5 (IL5R; 147851), granulocyte-macrophage CSF (CSF2R; 306250)
(Tavernier et al., 1991), and interleukin-3 (IL3RA; 308385) (Kitamura et
al., 1991).

See also the low-affinity alpha subunit of the receptor (CSF2RA; 306250)

CLONING

Hayashida et al. (1990) isolated cDNA clones corresponding to the beta
subunit of the GMCSF receptor from a human erythroleukemia cDNA library.
The deduced 897-amino acid protein had a molecular mass of approximately
120 kD and shares 56% sequence identity with the mouse AIC2B protein.

In the mouse, 2 distinct but related genes, AIC2A (Csf2rb2) and AIC2B
(Csf2rb1), encode the beta subunit common to Csf2r, Il5r, and Il3r
(Gorman et al., 1992). Hara and Miyajima (1992) stated that the mouse
AIC2B gene encodes a common beta subunit for the mouse Gmcsf and Il5
receptors, whereas AIC2A encodes a low-affinity Il3-binding protein by
itself. Hara and Miyajima (1992) found that AIC2A formed a high-affinity
Il3-binding protein when coexpressed with a mouse protein homologous to
the human alpha subunit. In addition, AIC2B formed a high-affinity
Il3-binding protein when coexpressed with the alpha subunit. Thus, the
mouse has 2 high-affinity Il3 receptors, but only the AIC2B gene encodes
a common beta subunit for the mouse Gmcsf, Il5, and Il3 receptors. Robb
et al. (1995) referred to the mouse AIC2B gene as 'beta-c' (for common)
and the AIC2A gene as 'beta-Il3.'

MAPPING

Shen et al. (1992) mapped the human CSF2RB gene to chromosome 22 by PCR
analysis of a series of human/rodent somatic cell hybrids. By
fluorescence in situ hybridization to normal human chromosomes and 2
translocations involving chromosome 22 as well as the chromosome
expressing the rare fragile site FRA22A, they regionalized the gene to
22q12.2-q13.1, proximal to the fragile site.

Gorman et al. (1992) demonstrated that the 2 mouse genes, provisionally
designated Il3rb1 and Il3rb2, are located in the same 250-kb restriction
fragment and map to chromosome 5, closely linked to the Sis locus
(PDGFB; 190040).

GENE FUNCTION

Tavernier et al. (1991) stated that the common receptor subunit, CSF2RB,
that is shared between IL5R and CSF2R provides a molecular basis for the
observation that IL5 (147850) and CSF2 (138960) can partially interfere
with each other's binding and have highly overlapping biologic
activities on eosinophils.

D'Andrea et al. (1994) isolated a mutant form of the IL5RB gene from
growth factor-independent cells that arose spontaneously after infection
of a murine factor-dependent hematopoietic cell line with a retroviral
expression construct of the common beta chain gene. The mutation
consisted of a 37-amino acid duplication of extracellular sequence that
included 2 conserved sequence motifs and conferred ligand-independent
growth on the cells. The results suggested that members of the large
family of cytokine receptors have the capacity to become oncogenically
active.

Jenkins et al. (1995) reported the identification of 2 activating point
mutations in the CSF2RB gene that were generated using a PCR-based
random mutagenesis procedure. By combining this procedure with a
retroviral expression cloning system, they isolated these mutants by
virtue of their ability to confer factor independence on a
factor-dependent hematopoietic cell line. The ability of point mutations
to activate the gene supported the possibility that such mutations could
contribute to human leukemia. In addition, the nature and properties of
these mutants had important implications for the mechanisms of signaling
by the 3 receptors that utilize the common beta subunit. One mutation,
val449-to-glu, was located within the transmembrane domain and, by
analogy with a similar mutation in the NEU oncogene (164870), might act
by inducing dimerization of the common beta subunit. The other mutation,
ile374-to-asn, lay in the extracellular, membrane-proximal portion of
the common beta molecule.

Dirksen et al. (1998) described expression defects of the CSF2RB and/or
the CSF2RA genes in 3 pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) and pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. Leukemic cells from all 3
patients failed to express express normal levels of beta-c. In addition,
leukemic cells from 2 of the patients lacked expression of CSF2RA, as
shown by flow cytometry. Strikingly reduced or absent function of beta-c
was demonstrated in clonogenic progenitor assays with absent
colony-forming unit growth after GMCSF or IL3 stimulation. The response
to growth factors acting via a growth factor receptor distinct from the
GMCSF/IL3/IL5 system was normal. After antileukemic treatment, the
pulmonary symptoms resolved and beta-c or beta-c plus CSF2RA expression
was normal. Dirksen et al. (1998) concluded that a defect in the CSF2RB
and/or CSF2RA on AML blasts can be associated with respiratory failure
in patients with AML.

Kondo et al. (2000) showed that a clonogenic common lymphoid progenitor,
a bone marrow-resident cell that gives rise exclusively to lymphocytes
(T, B, and natural killer cells), can be redirected to the myeloid
lineage by stimulation through exogenously expressed interleukin-2
receptor (146710) and GMCSF receptor. Analysis of mutants of the beta
chain of the IL2 receptor revealed that the granulocyte and monocyte
differentiation signals are triggered by different cytoplasmic domains,
showing that the signaling pathways responsible for these unique
developmental outcomes are separable. Finally, Kondo et al. (2000)
showed that the endogenous myelomonocytic cytokine receptors for GMCSF
and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF1R; 164770) are expressed
at low to moderate levels on the more primitive hematopoietic stem
cells, are absent on common lymphoid progenitors, and are upregulated
after myeloid lineage induction by IL2 (147680). Kondo et al. (2000)
concluded that cytokine signaling can regulate cell fate decisions and
proposed that a critical step in lymphoid commitment is downregulation
of cytokine receptors that drive myeloid cell development.

Using yeast 2-hybrid, protein pull-down, and coimmunoprecipitation
assays, Kao et al. (2008) showed that CBAP (TMEM102; 613936) interacted
with the box-2 motif of beta-c. Removal of GMCSF increased the amount of
beta-c and CBAP that immunoprecipitated from TF1 erythroleukemia cells
and that colocalized in intracellular compartments. Overexpression of
CBAP in IL3 (147740)-dependent Ba/F3 pro-B cells increased the
percentage of cells showing mitochondrial changes characteristic of
apoptosis and enhanced the apoptotic effect of GMCSF deprivation.
Conversely, knockdown of CBAP in TF1 cells reduced cell sensitivity to
GMCSF deprivation, but not to other proapoptotic stimuli. Kao et al.
(2008) concluded that CBAP binds the isolated beta-c molecule and has a
role in GMCSF deprivation-induced apoptosis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Freeburn et al. (1996) failed to find pathogenic mutations in the CSF2RB
gene in 35 patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Although different
patterns were detected in 25 (71%) AML patients and 8 (80%) of 10
healthy controls, all nucleotide changes were found to be polymorphisms.
The authors concluded that the CSF2RB is highly polymorphic, but point
mutations do not appear to contribute to the pathogenesis of AML.

Dirksen et al. (1997) described an expression defect of the CSF2RB gene
in 4 of 7 pediatric patients with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (see
614370). The patients failed to express normal levels of beta-c, as
shown by flow cytometry. Reduced or absent function of beta-c was
demonstrated by ligand binding studies and progenitor clonogenic assays.
Although molecular analysis of 1 patient identified what the authors
referred to as a pro602-to-thr (P602T) mutation, this change was shown
by Freeburn et al. (1996) to be a polymorphism (P603T with revised
sequence).

In a Japanese woman with adult-onset pulmonary surfactant metabolism
dysfunction-5 (SMDP5; 614370), manifest as pulmonary alveolar
proteinosis, Tanaka et al. (2011) identified a homozygous truncating
mutation in the CSF2RB gene (138981.0001). Each unaffected parent was
heterozygous for the mutation. Tanaka et al. (2011) speculated that the
late onset in this patient may have been due to compensatory factors
such as increased serum GMCSF acting through an intact CSF2RA subunit
(306250) or increased levels of other inflammatory cells.

ANIMAL MODEL

Robb et al. (1995) used gene targeting to create mice with a null
mutation of the common beta subunit of the Csf2rb1 gene (AIC2B). In the
homozygous mice, high-affinity binding of GMCSF (138960) was abolished,
while cells from heterozygous animals showed an intermediate number of
high-affinity receptors. Binding of IL3 (147740) was unaffected,
confirming that the IL3-specific beta-chain remained intact. Homozygous
animals showed reduced eosinophil numbers in peripheral blood and bone
marrow, while other hematologic parameters were normal. In clonal
cultures of homozygous null bone marrow cells, even high concentrations
of GMCSF and IL5 failed to stimulate colony formation, but the cells
exhibited normal quantitative responsiveness to stimulation by IL3 and
other growth factors. The mice exhibited normal development and survived
to young adult life, although they developed pulmonary
peribronchovascular lymphoid infiltrates and areas resembling alveolar
proteinosis. There was no detectable difference in the systemic
clearance and distribution of GMCSF.

D'Andrea et al. (1998) produced transgenic mice expressing a spontaneous
mutation in the murine Csf2rb1 gene that confers growth
factor-independent proliferation on primary committed myeloid
progenitors. All transgenic mice displayed a myeloproliferative disorder
characterized by splenomegaly, erythrocytosis, and granulocytic and
megakaryocytic hyperplasia. This disorder resembled the human disease
polycythemia vera (263300), suggesting that activating mutations in the
CSF2RB gene may play a role in the pathogenesis of that
myeloproliferative disorder. In addition, the transgenic mice developed
a sporadic, progressive neurologic disorder and displayed bilateral,
symmetrical foci of necrosis in the white matter of the brainstem
associated with an accumulation of macrophages. D'Andrea et al. (1998)
concluded that chronic CSF2RB activation also has the potential to
contribute to pathologic events in the central nervous system.

In a Japanese woman with adult-onset pulmonary surfactant metabolism
dysfunction-5 (SMDP5; 614370), manifest as pulmonary alveolar
proteinosis and respiratory insufficiency, Tanaka et al. (2011)
identified a homozygous 1-bp deletion (631delC) in exon 6 of the CSF2RB
gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination. Each
unaffected parent was heterozygous for the mutation. GMCSF was very high
in the patient's serum and bronchoalveolar lavage, but autoantibodies to
GMCSF were not found. In vitro studies showed that the patient's
monocytes failed to differentiate into macrophages after stimulation
with GMCSF. There was also a lack of STAT5 (601511) phosphorylation in
response to GMCSF or IL3 stimulation, suggesting defective signaling by
the common beta-subunit of the GMCSF receptor (CSF2RB). Flow cytometry
of patient monocytes showed lack of CSF2RB expression, and CSF2RB mRNA
was not detected in patient cells. Tanaka et al. (2011) speculated that
the late onset in this patient may have been due to compensatory
factors, such as increased serum GMCSF acting through an intact CSF2RA
subunit (306250) or increased levels of other inflammatory cells.

300108	TITLE *300108 DIAPHANOUS, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 2; DIAPH2
;;DIA;;
DIA2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In the course of cloning the DIAPH1 gene (602121), which is mutant in
nonsyndromic deafness DFNA1 (124900), Lynch et al. (1997) identified
DIAPH2, a second human homolog of the Drosophila 'diaphanous' (dia)
gene. Mutant alleles of dia affect spermatogenesis or oogenesis and lead
to sterility. Castrillon and Wasserman (1994), who identified the dia
locus in Drosophila by screening for male-sterility mutations, found
that alterations in cytokinesis were associated with mutated dia
alleles.

Bione et al. (1998) identified DIAPH2, which they called DIA, as the
gene disrupted by a breakpoint in a family with premature ovarian
failure (POF2A; 300511), and they isolated several cDNAs. The use of
alternative last exons results in 2 DIAPH2 proteins that differ in their
C termini: DIAPH2-156, which uses exon 156 and contains 1,101 amino
acids, and DIAPH2-12C, which uses exon 12C and contains 1,096 amino
acids. The sequence encoded by exon 156 is significantly similar to the
comparable sequence of Drosophila dia, while the sequence encoded by
exon 12C is quite different. DIAPH2-156 and Drosophila dia share about
39% amino acid identity. Both DIAPH2 isoforms contain formin homology-1
(FH1) and FH2 domains that are flanked by 2 coiled-coil domains. DIAPH2
also has a predicted nuclear localization signal near its C terminus.
Bione et al. (1998) stated that DIAPH2 is the first human member of the
FH1/FH2 protein family. Members of this family affect cytokinesis and
other actin-mediated morphogenetic processes that are required in early
steps of development. Northern blot analysis of human adult and fetal
tissues detected 4 DIAPH2 transcripts, 3 of which were expressed
ubiquitously and the fourth exclusively in adult testis. Bione et al.
(1998) showed that the Diaph2 gene was expressed in developing ovaries
and testis of the mouse, as well as in all other tissues, from the E16
stage.

Using ARHD (605781) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a HeLa cell
cDNA library, Gasman et al. (2003) cloned a splice variant of DIAPH2
that they designated DIA2C. Compared with the DIAPH2-12C isoform, which
Gasman et al. (2003) referred to as DIA2B, DIA2C contains a deletion of
11 amino acids and an insertion of 7 amino acids in the N-terminal part
containing the GTPase-binding domain. Immunolocalization revealed that
epitope-tagged DIA2C was cytosolic, but when coexpressed with ARHD, the
2 proteins colocalized to early endosomes.

GENE FUNCTION

Gasman et al. (2003) demonstrated that the DIA2C splice variant
interacted with ARHD both in vivo and in vitro and that ARHD recruited
cytosolic DIA2C onto early endosomes. Coimmunoprecipitation of
cotransfected HeLa cells indicated that DIA2C interacted with ARHD in
the GTP-bound form. The interaction induced the alignment of early
endosomes along actin filaments and reduced their motility. In the
absence of ARHD, deletion of the DIA2C GTPase-binding domain led to
DIA2C localization to endosomes and blocked about 85% of endosomes in a
nonmotile state. Coexpression of DIA2C and ARHD in HeLa cells stimulated
SRC kinase (CSK; 124095) activity, which was required to alter endosome
motility. Gasman et al. (2003) concluded that DIA2C and SRC (190090) are
sequentially activated by ARHD to regulate the motility of early
endosomes through interaction with the actin cytoskeleton.

Yasuda et al. (2004) demonstrated that Cdc42 (116952) and mDia3, the
mouse homolog of DIAPH2, regulate microtubule attachment to
kinetochores.

Cheng et al. (2011) found that human DIA3 had an essential role in
metaphase chromosome alignment that depended on microtubule binding and
interaction with EB1 (MAPRE1; 603108), but not on actin binding.
Knockdown of DIA3 in human cell lines resulted in mitotic errors,
including anaphase delay and presence of unaligned chromosomes.
Coimmunoprecipitation and mutation analysis revealed that DIA3
independently interacted with EB1 and APC (611731), and interaction of
DIA3 with EB1 was required for metaphase chromosome alignment. Aurora B
(AURKB; 604970) phosphorylated DIA3 within its FH2 domain.
Dephosphorylated DIA3 bound along the length of purified microtubules,
and phosphorylation of DIA3 by Aurora B was essential for release of
DIA3 from microtubules and chromosome alignment.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bione et al. (1998) determined that the DIAPH2 gene spans about 1 Mb.

MAPPING

Using FISH, Bione et al. (1998) showed that a human EST corresponding to
DIAPH2 maps to chromosome Xq22. Banfi et al. (1997) had indicated that a
human homolog of diaphanous maps to Xq22. Lynch et al. (1997) noted that
a nonsyndromic form of X-linked deafness, DFN2 (304500), also maps to
Xq22, making the DIAPH2 gene a candidate for DFN2 hearing loss.

CYTOGENETICS

Bione et al. (1998) demonstrated that a balanced X(12) translocation
(300108.0001) in a family with premature ovarian failure (POF2A; 300511)
reported by Sala et al. (1997) had a breakpoint in the last intron of
the DIAPH2 gene. As a consequence of the translocation, Bione et al.
(1998) predicted that the DIAPH2 gene on the derivative X chromosome
could be fused to sequences from chromosome 12, resulting in the
possible synthesis of an altered protein. Alternatively, in the absence
of the last coding exon and of the 3-prime untranslated region,
truncated transcripts might be both unstable and prone to degradation
soon after transcription. Bione et al. (1998) commented that no deafness
was present in this family.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PREMATURE OVARIAN FAILURE 2A
DIAPH2, INTRONIC BREAKPOINT

In the family of patient BC studied by Sala et al. (1997), a balanced
X;12 translocation, t(X;12)(q21;p1.3), was associated with premature
ovarian failure (300511). Patient BC had secondary amenorrhea, with no
other associated features, at the age of 17 years. Her mother, who
carried the same chromosomal rearrangement, was diagnosed with premature
menopause at the age of 32 years. At diagnosis, both mother and daughter
had high gonadotropin levels and inactivation of the normal X chromosome
(Philippe et al., 1993). The breakpoint was mapped, by FISH, to a
specific YAC. The translocation breakpoint was found to be in the last
200-kb intron of the gene.

180460	TITLE *180460 RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN S6; RPS6
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Ribosomal protein S6 is the major substrate of protein kinases (e.g.,
300075) in eukaryotic ribosomes. Heinze et al. (1988) used polyclonal
antibodies directed against a synthetic octopeptide of the
phosphorylation site of the ribosomal protein S6 of rat liver to screen
a lambda-gt11 cDNA expression library of human lymphoblasts. In this way
an S6-specific clone was isolated. It consisted of the complete coding
sequence of 747 bases. The sequence of 249 amino acids deduced from the
nucleotide sequence showed a high degree of similarity to that of rat
liver S6. Southern blot analysis of human genomic DNA suggested that
multiple genes exist for the S6 protein. Independently, Lott and Mackie
(1988) cloned human RPS6 cDNAs using oligonucleotides based on the rat
Rps6 and yeast Rps10 amino acid sequences.

By Northern blot analysis using a rat Rps6 probe, Pogue-Geile et al.
(1991) found increased levels of RPS6 mRNA in 3 of 3 human colorectal
tumors and 2 of 4 human colon polyps relative to matched normal colonic
mucosa. RPS6 is expressed as an approximately 820-bp transcript.

GENE STRUCTURE

Antoine and Fried (1992) demonstrated that the RPS6 gene is 3,979 bp
long and comprises 6 exons.

MAPPING

Using a PCR product for the analysis of rodent/human somatic cell
hybrids, Feo et al. (1992) mapped the RPS6 gene to 9pter-p13. By
fluorescence in situ hybridization, Antoine and Fried (1992)
sublocalized the RPS6 gene to 9p21. Kenmochi et al. (1998) confirmed the
mapping assignment reported by Antoine and Fried (1992).

ANIMAL MODEL

Because ribosome biogenesis plays an essential role in cell
proliferation, control mechanisms may have evolved to recognize lesions
in this critical anabolic process. To test this possibility, Volarevic
et al. (2000) conditionally deleted the gene encoding 40S ribosomal
protein S6 in the liver of adult mice. Unexpectedly, livers from fasted
animals deficient in S6 grew in response to nutrients even though
biogenesis of 40S ribosomes was abolished. However, liver cells failed
to proliferate or induce cyclin E expression after partial hepatectomy,
despite formation of active cyclin D-CDK4 complexes. Volarevic et al.
(2000) concluded that their results implied that abrogation of 40S
ribosome biogenesis may induce a checkpoint control that prevents cell
cycle progression.

In order to study the relationship between ribosome biogenesis, cell
growth, and proliferation, Sulic et al. (2005) conditionally deleted 1
or 2 alleles of Rps6 in mouse thymi. Complete Rps6 deletion abrogated
T-cell development. Hemizygous Rps6 expression had no effect on T-cell
maturation in the thymus but inhibited the accumulation of T cells in
the spleen and lymph nodes as a result of their decreased survival in
peripheral lymphoid organs. Stimulation of Rps6-heterozygous T cells
induced a normal increase in size, but cell cycle progression was
impaired in a p53 (TP53; 191170)-dependent manner.

606534	TITLE *606534 CYTOCHROME P450, SUBFAMILY IIIA, POLYPEPTIDE 43; CYP3A43
DESCRIPTION Subfamily IIIA of the cytochrome P450 family is considered to be the
major drug metabolizing subfamily. Its members are localized in the
organs most associated with drug disposition, including the liver,
gastrointestinal tract, and kidney. The major isoform in liver is CYP3A4
(124010), whereas CYP3A5 (605325) is present at only 10 to 30% of CYP3A4
levels, and CYP3A7 (605340) is not clearly present in adult liver at
all.

CLONING

By use of PCR on liver cDNA and 3-prime RACE, Domanski et al. (2001)
isolated a cDNA encoding CYP3A43, a novel cytochrome P450 IIIA isoform.
Sequence analysis predicted that the 503-amino acid protein differs from
the other forms at the N terminus as well as at 2 C-terminal conserved
sites and 4 sites that are important for the regioselectivity of steroid
hydroxylation. RNA dot-blot analysis detected only weak expression in
liver, whereas PCR of cDNA panels found expression in liver, kidney,
pancreas, and prostate as well as fetal liver and fetal skeletal muscle.
SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis showed expression of an approximately
55-kD protein. Functional analysis indicated that, under appropriate
conditions, CYP3A43 exhibits low but reproducible testosterone
6-beta-hydroxylase activity. Gellner et al. (2001) found the highest
expression level of CYP3A43 mRNA in prostate, an organ with extensive
steroid metabolism. It was also expressed in several other tissues
including liver, where it could be induced by rifampicin.

By EST database searching and 5-prime RACE, Westlind et al. (2001) also
obtained a cDNA encoding CYP3A43. The deduced protein is 76%, 76%, and
72% identical to CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7, respectively. Real-time PCR
in 10 different livers revealed that CYP3A43 is expressed at 0.1% and 2%
of the levels of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5.

GENE STRUCTURE

By RT-PCR analysis, Domanski et al. (2001) and Westlind et al. (2001)
determined that the CYP3A43 gene contains 13 exons and may have splice
variants.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Gellner et al. (2001) mapped the CYP3A43 gene
within a 231-kb region on chromosome 7q21.1, along with the CYP3A4,
CYP3A5, and CYP3A7 genes and 3 pseudogenes.

125255	TITLE *125255 DECORIN; DCN
;;PROTEOGLYCAN II;;
PG II;;
PG40
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Decorin and biglycan (301870) are related but distinct small
proteoglycans found in many connective tissues. Using Northern blot
analysis or RT-PCR, Danielson et al. (1993) detected the 2 alternatively
spliced leader exons of the DCN gene in a variety of mRNAs isolated from
human cell lines and tissues. Sequences highly homologous (74-87%) to
exons Ia and Ib were found in the 5-prime untranslated region of avian
and bovine decorin, respectively. This high degree of conservation among
species suggested regulatory functions for these leader exons. In situ
hybridization studies of developing mouse embryos suggested that decorin
may play a role in epithelial/mesenchymal interactions during organ
development and shaping (Scholzen et al., 1994).

GENE STRUCTURE

Danielson et al. (1993) found that the human decorin gene spans more
than 38 kb and contains 8 exons and very large introns, 2 of which are
5.4 and more than 13.2 kb. They discovered 2 alternatively spliced
leader exons, Ia and Ib, in the 5-prime untranslated region.

MAPPING

By Southern analysis of a panel of human-rodent somatic cell hybrid DNAs
with cDNA probes, McBride et al. (1990) assigned the DCN gene to
chromosome 12. Regionalization to 12p12.1-qter was obtained by examining
hybrids containing spontaneous breaks or well-characterized
translocations involving chromosome 12. Hybridization with subfragment
cDNA probes suggested the presence of 2 copies of the DCN gene, or
related sequences, at the locus on chromosome 12, although there was no
evidence for the function of more than one DCN gene. By in situ
hybridization, Pulkkinen et al. (1992) placed the DCN gene at 12q21-q22.
Vetter et al., (1993) mapped the human decorin gene by in situ
hybridization to 12q21.3. Using a genomic clone as the labeled probe and
in situ hybridization, Danielson et al. (1993) mapped the DCN gene to
12q23. They specifically noted that there were 4 times as many grains
centered on 12q23 as on 12q21, where Pulkkinen et al. (1992) had placed
the probable site. In a study of candidate genes for Noonan syndrome
(163950), Ion et al. (2000) reassigned the map position of DCN to
12q13.2 using FISH. Scholzen et al. (1994) assigned the homologous gene
in the mouse to chromosome 10, using interspecific backcrossing.

GENE FUNCTION

Vogel and Clark (1989) found little evidence that the metabolism of
either decorin or biglycan is altered by abnormalities in the structure
or secretion of types I and III collagen. In a presumably homozygous
case of the Marfan syndrome (154700) reported by Schollin et al. (1988),
Pulkkinen et al. (1990) found markedly decreased level of mRNA for
decorin, markedly decreased decorin polypeptide in the culture medium of
fibroblasts from the infant, and deficient effect of interleukin-1-beta
(147720) on the transcription of decorin as tested in these fibroblasts.
In 3 of 12 other unrelated Marfan patients, they also found deficient
decorin expression.

Dyne et al. (1996) studied 2 patients with osteogenesis imperfecta and
the same gly415-to-ser mutation of the COL1A1 gene (120150.0044), but a
different clinical expression. They speculated that these differences
could be the result of abnormalities in other connective tissue
proteins. Since decorin is a component of connective tissue, binds to
type I collagen fibrils, and plays a role in matrix assembly, they
studied decorin production in skin fibroblasts from these 2 patients.
Cultured fibroblasts from the patient with extremely severe osteogenesis
imperfecta (classified as type II/III) were found to secrete barely
detectable amounts of decorin into culture medium. Northern blot
analysis showed decorin mRNA levels below the limit of detection. The
patient with a less severe phenotype had fibroblasts that expressed
decorin normally. Dyne et al. (1996) suggested that the different
clinical phenotypes could be due to the differing genetic backgrounds of
the patients, such that in the more severely affected patient the
absence of decorin aggravated the clinical phenotype.

When expressed ectopically, decorin is capable of suppressing the growth
of various tumor cell lines. Moscatello et al. (1998) demonstrated that
it induced a marked growth suppression in A431 squamous carcinoma cells,
when either exogenously added or endogenously produced by a transgene.
Decorin caused rapid phosphorylation of the EGF receptor (131550) and a
concurrent activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signal
pathway. Thus, EGF and decorin converge functionally to regulate the
cell cycle through activation of a common pathway that ultimately leads
to growth suppression.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a family with congenital stromal corneal dystrophy (CSCD; 610048),
Bredrup et al. (2005) identified a heterozygous 1-bp deletion in the
last exon, which they erroneously labeled exon 10 (Rodahl, 2009), of the
DCN gene (125255.0001). The deletion was found in all affected family
members but not in any healthy family member or in 200 normal controls.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CORNEAL DYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL STROMAL
DCN, 1-BP DEL, 967T

In a Norwegian family originally reported by Odland (1968) with
congenital stromal corneal dystrophy (CSCD; 610048), Bredrup et al.
(2005) identified a heterozygous 1-bp deletion (967delT) in the last
exon, which they erroneously labeled exon 10 (Rodahl, 2009), of the DCN
gene. The mutation was predicted to lead to a frameshift, alteration of
4 amino acids, and loss of the C-terminal 33 amino acids (S323fsX5).
Bredrup et al. (2005) postulated that the defective interaction of
mutant decorin with collagen would disturb the regularity of corneal
collagen in affected heterozygotes.

605404	TITLE *605404 BCL2-RELATED OVARIAN KILLER; BOK
;;BCL2-LIKE 9; BCL2L9
DESCRIPTION Apoptosis involves 2 essential steps: 'decision,' which involves the
interaction of pro- and antiapoptotic BCL2 (151430) family proteins, and
'execution,' which involves caspases (e.g., CASP3; 600636).

Hsu et al. (1997) determined that an antiapoptotic BCL2 family protein,
MCL1 (159552), is highly expressed in ovary, where 99% of follicles die
and only 1% can ovulate. Using rat Mcl1 as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid
screen of an ovarian fusion cDNA library, they isolated a cDNA encoding
BOK (BCL2-related ovarian killer). The deduced 213-amino acid BOK
protein contains 2 potential phosphorylation sites near the N terminus;
conserved BCL2 homology (BH)-1, -2, and -3 domains but not the
antiapoptotic BH4 domain; and a C-terminal transmembrane domain. Yeast
2-hybrid analysis determined that BOK interacts strongly with only some
antiapoptotic BCL2 proteins and not at all with proapoptotic BCL2
proteins (e.g., BAD; 603167). Morphologic and DNA fragmentation analyses
determined that BOK induces apoptosis in transfected cells, and this
apoptosis could be blocked by coexpression with the baculovirus-derived
p35 cysteine protease inhibitor. Northern blot analysis detected a
1.5-kb Bok transcript only in rat reproductive tissues. In situ
hybridization analysis detected high levels of Bok expression in the
granulosa cells of antral and preantral follicles. Southern blot
analysis showed that rat Bok hybridizes strongly with human genomic DNA.
Hsu et al. (1997) concluded that BOK is a novel proapoptotic member of
the BCL2 family of proteins.

604776	TITLE *604776 MAJOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY COMPLEX, CLASS II, DR BETA-5; HLA-DRB5
DESCRIPTION Three subregions of the human major histocompatibility (HLA) complex on
6p21.3, DP, DQ, and DR, determine class II molecules, which are
essential in the cellular recognition interactions involved in the
generation of an immune response. Several class II antigens are also
associated with disease states. The extremely high polymorphism of HLA
class II transmembrane heterodimers is due to a few hypervariable
segments present in the most external domain of their alpha and beta
chains. The alpha chain of HLA-DR is not polymorphic, whereas the beta
chain is highly so. Some changes in amino acid sequence are critical in
disease susceptibility associations as well as the ability to present
processed antigens to T cells. By screening an HLA-DR5-homozygous cell
line cDNA library with a HLA-DRB1 (142857) probe, Tieber et al. (1986)
obtained an HLA-DRB5 cDNA encoding a 266-amino acid protein, of which
the first 29 amino acids constitute a signal peptide. Sequence
comparisons with other HLA-DRB sequences revealed regions of variability
at amino acid positions 9-13, 26-38, and 67-74 in the mature protein,
all of which are in the first external domain. The average amino acid
sequence difference between HLA-DRB5 and HLA-DRB1, HLA-DRB2, and
HLA-DRB4 is 13.5%.

Lang et al. (2002) examined the association of multiple sclerosis (MS;
126200) with HLA-DRB1*1501 and -DRB5*0101 polymorphisms by determining
the antigen-recognition profile of an MS patient with a
relapsing-remitting disease course. A T-cell receptor (TCR) from the
patient recognized both DRB1*1501-restricted myelin basic protein (MBP;
159430) (residues 85 to 99) and DRB5*0101-restricted Epstein-Barr virus
DNA polymerase peptide. The crystal structure of both DRB-antigen
complexes revealed a marked degree of structural equivalence at the
surface presented for TCR recognition, with 4 identical TCR-peptide
contacts. Lang et al. (2002) concluded that these similarities support
the concept of molecular mimicry (in structural terms, a similarity of
charge distribution) involving HLA molecules and suggested that these
structural details may explain the preponderance of MHC class II
associations in HLA-associated diseases. They noted the findings of
Madsen et al. (1999) with transgenic mice, which also showed that MBP(85
to 99) associated with HLA-DRB1*1501 was involved in the development of
an MS-like disease.

611418	TITLE *611418 SMALL G PROTEIN SIGNALING MODULATOR 2; SGSM2
;;KIAA0397
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database searching with the sequence of small G protein signaling
modulator-1 (SGSM1; 611417) as query, followed by RT-PCR and RACE of a
human brain cDNA library, Yang et al. (2007) cloned SGSM2, which had
previously been cloned and named KIAA0397 by Ishikawa et al. (1997). The
deduced 1,051-amino acid SGSM2 protein contains an N-terminal RUN domain
and a C-terminal TBC domain. Like SGSM1 and SGSM3 (611418), SGSM2
contains a RAP (see RAP1A, 179520)-interacting domain (RAPID) (amino
acids 301-350), containing 5 blocks of conserved sequence following the
RUN motif. Northern blot analysis detected variable expression of 6.0-
and 9.4-kb SGSM2 transcripts in several human tissues. Mouse tissues
showed a similar expression profile of Sgsm2, with evidence of splice
variants.

GENE FUNCTION

Using immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses of proteins
expressed by transfected human embryonic kidney cells, Yang et al.
(2007) showed that SGSM1, SGSM2, and SGSM3 coimmunoprecipitated with all
RAP proteins examined, including RAP1A, RAP1B (179530), RAP2A (179540),
and RAP2B (179541). Yang et al. (2007) also found that endogenous Rab4
(179511) and Rab11 (see RAB11A, 605570) interacted with all of the SGSM
proteins in the mouse neuroblastoma cell line; however, Rab3 (see RAB3A,
179490), Rab5 (see RAB5A, 179512), and Rab8 (see RAB8A, 165040)
interacted only with SGSM1 and SGSM3.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yang et al. (2007) determined that the SGSM2 gene contains 23 exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1997) mapped the SGSM2
gene to chromosome 17. By genomic sequence analysis, Yang et al. (2007)
localized the gene to 17p13.3.

602784	TITLE *602784 CORTISTATIN; CORT
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

De Lecea et al. (1996) identified cortistatin, a rat neuropeptide that
exhibits strong structural similarity to somatostatin (182450). The
14-amino acid neuropeptide is produced by cleavage of a 112-amino acid
precursor, preprocortistatin. Administration of cortistatin into brain
ventricles specifically enhances slow-wave sleep, presumably by
antagonizing the effects of acetylcholine on cortical excitability.

De Lecea et al. (1997) cloned cDNAs encoding mouse and human
preprocortistatin. Sequence analysis revealed that the predicted rat and
mouse proteins share 82% identity, and the mature neuropeptides are
identical. Compared to rat and mouse cortistatin, the putative human
neuropeptide has a single amino acid substitution and 3 additional
N-terminal amino acids. Independently, Fukusumi et al. (1997) isolated a
human preprocortistatin cDNA. They noted that the predicted rat and
human proteins are 55% identical. The 105-amino acid human
preprocortistatin contains a 21-amino acid putative signal sequence.

By Northern blot analysis, de Lecea et al. (1997) determined that
preprocortistatin is expressed as 2 mRNAs in human and mouse brain.
Fukusumi et al. (1997) observed a single 1-kb band on Northern blots of
spinal cord and caudate nucleus mRNA, and faint bands in cerebral
cortex, hippocampus, and testis. Using in situ hybridization, de Lecea
et al. (1997) found that mouse preprocortistatin mRNA is present in
GABAergic interneurons in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus.

GENE FUNCTION

Using chemically synthesized peptide and mammalian cells expressing
human somatostatin receptors (SSTRs), Fukusumi et al. (1997) showed that
human cortistatin inhibited the cAMP production induced by forskolin
through SSTRs, and bound SSTR subtypes in almost the same manner as rat
cortistatin. Administration of the human neuropeptide to rat cerebral
ventricle caused flattening of cortical and hippocampal
electroencephalograms, suggesting that it had sleep-modulating activity
similar to that of rat cortistatin.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ejeskar et al. (2000) determined that the CORT gene contains 2 exons
divided by a 1-kb intron.

MAPPING

By analysis of an interspecific backcross, de Lecea et al. (1997) mapped
the preprocortistatin gene to the distal portion of mouse chromosome 4
and, by homology of synteny, to chromosome 1p36 in humans. Ejeskar et
al. (2000) mapped the CORT gene to 1p36.3-p36.2 by radiation hybrid
analysis and BAC physical mapping.

ANIMAL MODEL

In a murine model of Crohn disease (see IBD1; 266600), Gonzalez-Rey et
al. (2006) demonstrated that cortistatin treatment significantly
ameliorated the clinical and histopathologic severity of inflammatory
colitis. The therapeutic effect was associated with downregulation of
inflammatory and Th1-driven autoimmune responses, including regulation
of a wide spectrum of inflammatory mediators. Gonzalez-Rey et al. (2006)
concluded that cortistatin is an antiinflammatory factor capable of
deactivating intestinal inflammatory response and restoring mucosal
immune tolerance at multiple levels.

Gonzalez-Rey et al. (2006) found that Cort protected mice with various
models of lethal endotoxemia from mortality and reduced related
histopathologic manifestations. The protection was further enhanced in a
synergistic manner by treatment with vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP;
192320). Cort-treated macrophages stimulated with LPS produced less Tnf
(191160), Il6 (147620), and nitric oxide than controls. Gonzalez-Rey et
al. (2006) concluded that CORT represents a potential multistep
therapeutic agent for human septic shock.

116890	TITLE *116890 CATHEPSIN E; CTSE
;;CATE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cathepsin E, an endolysosomal aspartic proteinase predominantly
expressed in cells of the immune system, has an important role in immune
responses (Yanagawa et al., 2007).

CLONING

Taggart et al. (1989) used sets of complementary oligonucleotide probes
specific for the highly conserved active site region of aspartic
proteinases to isolate cDNA clones encoding novel enzymes of this class.
They identified 6 classes of cDNA clones in a gastric adenocarcinoma
cDNA library using a set of 18-mer probes. One of the cDNAs, designated
AGS402, was shown by DNA analysis to correspond to the predicted coding
sequence of cathepsin E. Couvreur et al. (1989, 1990) also isolated a
full-length CTSE cDNA clone from a gastric adenocarcinoma cDNA library.

Azuma et al. (1989, 1989) reported the amino acid sequence of CTSE
predicted on the basis of the cDNA sequence and compared the sequence
with that of other aspartic proteinases. Azuma et al. (1992)
demonstrated that multiple transcripts result from alternative
polyadenylation of the primary transcripts of the single CTSE gene.

GENE STRUCTURE

Azuma et al. (1992) determined that the CTSE gene contains 9 exons and
spans 17.5 kb. The size and placement of the exons are highly conserved
relative to other aspartic proteinases.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis, Taggart et al. (1989) mapped the CTSE
gene to chromosome 1. Azuma et al. (1989, 1989) also assigned the CTSE
gene to chromosome 1.

Couvreur et al. (1989, 1990) mapped the CTSE gene to chromosome
1q23-qter by analysis of human/rodent hybrid cell lines containing
different X;1 translocations. CTSE was further localized to chromosome
1q31 by in situ hybridization.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yanagawa et al. (2007) found that cathepsin E deficiency in mice
resulted in a lysosome storage disorder in macrophages that was
characterized by accumulation of major lysosomal membrane
sialoglycoproteins, including Lamp1 (153330), Lamp2 (309060), and Limp2
(SCARB2; 602257), and elevated lysosomal pH. Trafficking of soluble
lysosomal proteins to lysosomes was also partially impaired in Cate -/-
macrophages. Treatment of wildtype macrophages with a cathepsin E
inhibitor also led to accumulation of these lysosomal proteins and
elevated pH. Since vacuolar-type H(+) ATPase (see 603097) activity was
not altered in Cate -/- macrophages, Yanagawa et al. (2007) hypothesized
that the elevated lysosomal pH in Cate -/- macrophages was likely due to
the accumulation of the highly acidic lysosomal sialoglycoproteins.

;;ADENYLATE KINASE 3-LIKE 1, FORMERLY; AK3L1, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using primers based on the conserved region of mitochondrial Ak3 cDNA
from bovine, rat, and mouse, followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE, Noma
et al. (2001) cloned human AK3 from a liver cDNA library. The deduced
227-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 25.6 kD. AK3
shares 57.4% amino acid identity with AK4 (AK3L1; 103030). It shares
75%, 90%, and 91% amino acid identity with bovine, rat, and mouse Ak3,
respectively. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.2-kb transcript in all
tissues examined. Expression was highest in heart, liver, and skeletal
muscle, moderate in kidney and pancreas, and weak in brain, placenta,
and lung. Transcripts of 5, 1.8, and 1.35 kb were detected in heart,
liver, and pancreas. Western blot analysis detected AK3 at an apparent
molecular mass of 28 kD in all tissues examined. Subcellular
fractionation of mouse liver and kidney detected Ak3 in the
mitochondrial fraction.

GENE FUNCTION

Noma et al. (2001) assayed recombinant AK3 expressed in E. coli and
showed that the enzyme had GTP:ATP phosphotransferase activity. Human
embryonic kidney cells had endogenous phosphotransferase activity, which
increased following transfection of AK3 cDNA.

MAPPING

By study of somatic cell hybrids, Povey et al. (1976) assigned the AK3
gene to chromosome 9. The smallest region of overlap for AK3 was
estimated to be 9p24-p13 (Robson and Meera Khan, 1982).

By interspecific backcross linkage analysis, Pilz et al. (1995) mapped
the Ak3 gene to mouse chromosome 4.

606818	TITLE *606818 DIPEPTIDYL PEPTIDASE III; DPP3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DPP3 (EC 3.4.14.4) is one of the dipeptidyl aminopeptidases that remove
N-terminal dipeptides from physiologically active peptides such as
angiotensin (see 106150) or enkephalin (131330).

CLONING

Fukasawa et al. (1999) isolated a partial DPP3 cDNA clone from a
placenta cDNA library, using antibody to the purified protein as probe.
By mass spectrometry, Abramic et al. (2000) determined that the
molecular mass of full-length DPP3 is 82.5 kD; by SDS-PAGE, the apparent
molecular mass is 81.2 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

By mutation and enzyme analysis of the rat recombinant DPP3 protein,
Fukasawa et al. (1999) found that DPP3 shows zinc-dependent
metalloprotease activity and contains a conserved HELLGH motif with
similarity to the zincin HExxH consensus motif. Abramic et al. (2000)
noted that whereas the enzymes purified from rat and human erythrocytes
show the same molecular mass, pI, and enzyme substrates, they differ
significantly in their temperature stability, pH optima, kinetic
parameters, and sensitivity to divalent cations, sulfhydryl reagents,
and microbial protease inhibitors.

MAPPING

Fukasawa et al. (2000) mapped the DPP3 gene to chromosome 11q12-q13.1 by
FISH.

;;PANBRONCHIOLITIS-RELATED MUCIN-LIKE 2; PBMUCL2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for genes in a region of chromosome 6 linked to diffuse
panbronchiolitis (DPB; 604809), Hijikata et al. (2011) identified
PBMUCL1 (613917) and PBMUCL2, which they initially called G4 and G2,
respectively. They cloned the genes by RT-PCR and RACE of primary
cultured human bronchial epithelial cells. The deduced 251-amino acid
PBMUCL2 protein has an N-terminal signal sequence, followed by a
mucin-like domain of 15 tandem serine-, threonine-, and proline-rich
repeats of 11 amino acids each. The serines and threonines within the
mucin-like domain may be O-glycosylated, and PBMUCL2 has a putative
N-glycosylation site. RT-PCR analysis revealed expression in brain,
lung, spleen, thymus, and prostate, but not in 10 other tissues
examined.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hijikata et al. (2011) determined that the PBMUCL2 gene contains 4
coding exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Hijikata et al. (2011) mapped the PBMUCL2
gene to a mucin gene cluster on chromosome 6p21.3. The order of the
clustered genes, from telomere to centromere, is DPCR1 (613928), MUC21,
PBMUCL1, and PBMUCL2.
