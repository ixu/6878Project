123834	TITLE *123834 CYCLIN D3; CCND3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using murine cDNA clones for 3 cyclin D genes that are normally
expressed during the G1 phase of the cell cycle, Inaba et al. (1992)
cloned the cognate human genes. Motokura et al. (1992) also cloned the
CCND3 gene. Xiong et al. (1992) cloned CCND3 and found that all 3 human
D-type cyclin genes encode small (33-34 kD) proteins that share an
average of 57% identity over the entire coding region and 78% in the
cyclin box. The D-type cyclins are most closely related to cyclin A (39%
identity) and cyclin E (36%), followed by cyclin B (29%) and cyclin C
(21%).

GENE FUNCTION

Motokura et al. (1992) found that in normal human mammary epithelial
cells synchronized by growth factor deprivation and subsequent growth
factor stimulation, PRAD1/cyclin D1 (CCND1; 168461) expression peaked in
G1 and declined before the S phase, while cyclin D3 expression rose
later in G1 and remained elevated in S.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Shen et al. (2004) identified EIF3S12
(609596) as a binding partner of cyclin D3. The interaction was mediated
by the C terminus of cyclin D3. GST pull-down experiments and transient
transfections showed that EIF3S12 and cyclin D3 bound both in vitro and
in vivo, and EIF3S12 did not bind cyclin D1 or D2 (CCND2; 123833).
Immunofluorescence revealed EIF3S12 distributed in the nucleus and
cytoplasm in a pattern that overlapped with that of cyclin D3. In
addition, overexpression of cyclin D3 upregulated the translational
activity in HeLa cells in a dose-dependent manner.

GENE STRUCTURE

Inaba et al. (1992) determined that all 3 cyclin D genes are interrupted
by an intron at the same position.

Wang et al. (1996) showed that the mouse cyclin D3 gene contains 5 exons
spanning about 7 kb of genomic DNA. They confirmed the activity of the
gene promoter by linking the CCND3 1,681-bp 5-prime region to a reporter
gene and transiently transfecting various cell lines. Greatest
expression of the reporter gene was detected in cell lines that normally
expressed high levels of endogenous cyclin D3 mRNA.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids containing different human
chromosomes and by fluorescence in situ hybridization to metaphase
spreads from normal peripheral blood lymphocytes, Inaba et al. (1992)
assigned the CCND3 gene to 6p21. Motokura et al. (1992) mapped the gene
to chromosome 6 by use of human/rodent hybrids. Xiong et al. (1992)
mapped the CCND3 gene to 6p21 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

Xiong et al. (1992) identified a pseudogene corresponding to CCND2 and
one corresponding to CCND3 (123834). Inaba et al. (1992) found that
pseudogenes containing sequences related to cyclin D2 and cyclin D3 map
to 12p13 and 6p21, respectively.

ANIMAL MODEL

Kozar et al. (2004) tested the requirement for D-cyclins in mouse
development and in proliferation by generating mice lacking all
D-cyclins. Ccnd1 -/- Ccnd2 -/- Ccnd3 -/- mice developed until mid/late
gestation and died due to heart abnormalities combined with severe
anemia. The authors found that D-cyclins were critically required for
expansion of hematopoietic stem cells. In contrast, cyclin D-deficient
fibroblasts proliferated nearly normally, but showed increased
requirement for mitogenic stimulation in cell cycle reentry.
Proliferation of Ccnd1 -/- Ccnd2 -/- Ccnd3 -/- cells was resistant to
inhibition by p16(INK4a) (600160), but it critically depended on CDK2
(116953). Cells lacking D-cyclins displayed reduced susceptibility to
oncogenic transformation.

HSP90-ASSOCIATING RELATIVE OF CDC37; HARC;;
FLJ20639
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CDC37L1 is a cytoplasmic phosphoprotein that exists in complex with
HSP90 (HSPCA; 140571) as well as several other proteins involved in
HSP90-mediated protein folding (Scholz et al., 2001).

CLONING

By searching databases using CDC37 (605065) as a query, followed by
screening a signet ring cell gastric carcinoma cDNA library, Scholz et
al. (2001) cloned CDC37L1, which they named HARC. The deduced 337-amino
acid protein has a predicted molecular mass of 38.7 kD. HARC shares 31%
identity with CDC37 and 88% identity with mouse Harc. Northern blot
analysis detected high expression in human liver and skeletal muscle,
with lower levels in kidney, heart, brain, and placenta. By indirect
immunofluorescence and cell fractionation of kidney epithelial cells
transfected with HARC, Scholz et al. (2001) showed that HARC colocalized
to the cytosolic fraction with CDC37.

GENE FUNCTION

By coimmunoprecipitation experiments and analysis of HARC deletion
mutants, Scholz et al. (2001) showed that the central 120 amino acids of
HARC were required to bind HSP90. HARC and CDC37 binding to HSP90 were
mutually exclusive. HARC did not bind Src527F (SRC; 190090) or RAF1
(164760). By orthophosphate labeling and amino acid analysis, Scholz et
al. (2001) determined that HARC was serine phosphorylated by Src family
kinase Hck499F (HCK; 142370 ) and that both phosphorylated and
nonphosphorylated HARC forms associated with HSP90. By
coimmunoprecipitation, they showed that HARC also formed complexes with
HSP70 (HSPA1A; 140550), HOP (STIP1; 605063), an unidentified p22
protein, and immunophilins FKBP52 (FKBP4; 600611) and CYP40 (PPID;
601753); however, HARC did not associate with HSP90 cochaperone P23
(PTGES3; 607061).

GENE STRUCTURE

Scholz et al. (2001) determined that the CDC37L1 gene contains 7 exons.

MAPPING

By database sequence analysis, Scholz et al. (2001) mapped the CDC37L1
gene to chromosome 9p24.1.

;;ATP-BINDING CASSETTE 7; ABC7;;

ABC TRANSPORTER 7
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ABCB7 belongs to the large, highly conserved ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
transporter family. For background information on ABC transporters, see
300135.

CLONING

Savary et al. (1997) isolated a 2,684-bp mouse cDNA of a novel ABC
transporter, Abc7, from a macrophage cDNA library. Beginning with the
first ATG at 196, the Abc7 cDNA is predicted to encode a 629-amino acid
protein with 6 transmembrane segments followed by a canonical
ATP-binding cassette, features typical of a half-transporter. A search
of the human EST databases identified a 1,109-bp clone from a fetal
liver spleen cDNA library that showed 92% nucleotide sequence identity
to mouse Abc7. The putative protein product encoded by this clone is 94%
identical to the C-terminal 340 amino acids of mouse Abc7. These high
sequence identities led Savary et al. (1997) to conclude that the EST
clone is the human ortholog of Abc7. Northern blot analysis detected an
approximately 3-kb ABC7 transcript in human heart, skeletal muscle,
pancreas, lung, liver, placenta, and several cell lines, but not in
brain. Northern blot analysis performed on mouse embryos showed that
Abc7 was expressed through all the developmental stages examined,
beginning at embryonic day 6.5. A search of sequence databases revealed
that ABC7 has the highest homology with 2 yeast ABC transporters. Since
one of these, S. Pombe Htm1, is required for heavy-metal tolerance in
yeast, Savary et al. (1997) speculated that ABC7 may be involved in
metal homeostasis. Furthermore, Savary et al. (1997) noted that diseases
due to altered

Shimada et al. (1998) identified a human EST showing high sequence
similarity to the mouse Abc7 gene and the yeast ATM1 gene, which encodes
an ABC half-transporter located in the mitochondrial inner membrane. To
obtain the complete human ABC7 cDNA sequence, they isolated additional
cDNAs from a human fetal brain cDNA library. The predicted 752-amino
acid ABC7 protein contains 4 transmembrane domains and an N-terminal
mitochondrial targeting sequence. Human ABC7 has 92% and 49% amino acid
sequence identity with mouse Abc7 and yeast ATM1, respectively. Northern
blot analysis of human tissues detected a single 2.6-kb ABC7 transcript
that was strongly expressed in skeletal muscle and heart. Shimada et al.
(1998) suggested that ABC7 is a half-transporter involved in the
transport of heme from the mitochondria to the cytosol.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bekri et al. (2000) determined that the ABCB7 gene contains 16 exons.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, Savary et al. (1997) mapped the human and
mouse ABC7 genes to chromosomes Xq12-q13 and XC-XD, respectively,
regions that show homology of synteny.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Shimada et al. (1998) refined the
localization of the human ABC7 gene to chromosome Xq13.1-q13.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

X-linked sideroblastic anemia with ataxia (ASAT; 301310) is a recessive
disorder characterized by an infantile to early childhood onset of
nonprogressive cerebellar ataxia and mild anemia with hypochromia and
microcytosis. The ABC7 gene maps to the region (Xq13) harboring the ASAT
gene, mutations in which would cause the phenotype of X-linked
sideroblastic anemia with ataxia. ABC7 is an ortholog of the yeast ATM1
gene, whose product localizes to the mitochondrial inner membrane and is
involved in iron homeostasis. Allikmets et al. (1999) cloned the
full-length ABC7 cDNA and screened the entire coding region for
mutations in a kindred in which 5 male members manifested ASAT. A
missense mutation (300135.0001) was identified in a predicted
transmembrane segment of the ABC7 gene in these patients and was found
to segregate with the disease in the family. The mutation was not
detected in at least 600 chromosomes of general population controls.
Introduction of the corresponding mutation into the ATM1 gene of
Saccharomyces cerevisiae resulted in a partial loss of function of the
yeast ATM1 protein. In addition, the human wildtype ABC7 protein was
able to complement ATM1 deletion in yeast. The data indicated that ABC7
is the causal gene of ASAT and that ASAT is a mitochondrial disease
caused by mutation in the nuclear genome.

Bekri et al. (2000) identified a second missense mutation in the ABC7
gene (300135.0002) as the cause of sideroblastic anemia with cerebellar
ataxia.

ANIMAL MODEL

Pondarre et al. (2006) found that mouse embryonic stem cells and male
mouse embryos expressing a conditionally deleted Abcb7 allele were not
viable. Maternally-inherited Abcb7 deletion was lethal to female
embryos. By breeding a series of conditionally deleted transgenic lines,
Pondarre et al. (2006) demonstrated that lethality was due to a defect
in extraembryonic visceral endoderm, which, like all other
extraembryonic tissue, preferentially maintains the female X chromosome
as the active allele. X-inactivation assays and tissue-specific deletion
showed that Abcb7 was essential in all tissues except hepatocytes and
endothelial cells. In liver, loss of Abcb7 resulted in mild
mitochondrial injury, impaired cytosolic Fe-S cluster assembly, and
altered iron sensing by Irp1 (ACO1; 100880), which contributed to
dysregulation of hepatocyte iron metabolism and increased total liver
iron.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ANEMIA, SIDEROBLASTIC, AND SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA
ABCB7, ILE400MET

In the family with sideroblastic anemia and ataxia (301310) reported by
Pagon et al. (1985), Allikmets et al. (1999) identified a missense
mutation, ile400 to met, in the ABC7 gene.

.0002
ANEMIA, SIDEROBLASTIC, AND SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA
ABCB7, GLU433LYS

Bekri et al. (2000) described a family in which affected males with
sideroblastic anemia with ataxia (301310) had a missense mutation in
exon 10 of the ABC7 gene: a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 1305 of the
full-length cDNA, resulting in a charge inversion caused by the
substitution of lysine for glutamate at residue 433 C-terminal to the
putative sixth transmembrane domain of ABC7. In the older brother,
congenital ataxia had been diagnosed at the age of 4. The ataxia was
nonprogressive after computed tomography of the brain at age 18 showed
striking, selective cerebellar hypoplasia. The mother's blood film
showed dimorphism, consistent with an X-linked defect. The anemia was
refractory to treatment with pyridoxine.

.0003
ANEMIA, SIDEROBLASTIC, AND SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA
ABCB7, VAL411LEU

Maguire et al. (2001) studied 2 brothers with sideroblastic anemia with
ataxia (301310). They had hypochromic red cells and increased
erythrocyte protoporphyrin despite normal iron stores. The mother was
unaffected by ataxia and had normal iron stores but showed evidence of
some red cell hypochromia with heavy basophilic stippling that stained
positive for iron. Bone marrow biopsy confirmed the presence of ring
sideroblasts in one of the brothers. Direct sequencing of the ABCB7 gene
demonstrated hemizygosity in the brothers and heterozygosity in the
mother for a G-to-C transversion at position 1299 of the cDNA sequence.
This predicted a val411-to-leu (V411L) substitution at the beginning of
the last of 6 putative transmembrane regions of the protein. An uncle
affected by ataxia also carried this mutation.

CLA20
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Pevsner et al. (1994) cloned rat Ap3m2, which encodes a 47-kD protein
with about 80% amino acid identity to rat Ap3m1 (610366) and about 30%
amino acid identity to mouse mu-1 (see AP1M1; 603535) and rat mu-2
(AP2M1; 601024). Ap3m2 was expressed exclusively in rat brain and spinal
cord.

By amplifying exons from cosmid clones mapped to chromosome 8, followed
by screening a human fetal brain cDNA library, Koyama et al. (1995)
cloned AP3M2, which they designated CLA20. AP3M2 encodes a deduced
protein of 418 amino acids. Northern blot analysis detected ubiquitous
expression of a major 3.5-kb transcript and low expression of a minor
1.7-kb transcript in liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas.

MAPPING

Koyama et al. (1995) localized the AP3M2 gene to a cosmid clone that had
previously been mapped by FISH to chromosome 8p11.2.

;;miRNA191
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Micro RNAs (miRNAs), such as MIR191, are conserved small noncoding RNAs
that bind to complementary sequences in the 3-prime UTRs of target
mRNAs, inhibiting their translation and/or inducing their degradation
(Lena et al., 2012).

GENE FUNCTION

Using microarray analysis, Lena et al. (2012) found that MIR191 was
significantly upregulated in normal human neonatal epidermal
keratinocytes (HEKn) following development of senescence in culture.
Bioinformatic analysis and reporter gene assays revealed functional
MIR191 target sequences in the 3-prime UTRs of transcripts for the cell
cycle regulator CDK6 (603368) and the AT-rich binding protein SATB1
(602075). Western blot analysis confirmed that ectopic expression of
MIR191 in HEKn cells caused downregulation of SATB1 and CDK6,
concomitant with decreased cell proliferation and expression of
senescence markers.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the MIR191 gene to chromosome 3p21.31 based on an
alignment of the mature MIR191 sequence (CAACGGAAUCCCAAAAGCAGCUG) with
the genomic sequence (GRCh37).
