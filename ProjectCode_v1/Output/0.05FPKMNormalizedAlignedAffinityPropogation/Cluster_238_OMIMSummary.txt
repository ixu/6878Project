604065	TITLE *604065 CALCIUM CHANNEL, VOLTAGE-DEPENDENT, T TYPE, ALPHA-1G SUBUNIT; CACNA1G
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Voltage-activated calcium channels can be distinguished based on their
voltage-dependence, deactivation, and single-channel conductance. See
601011. Low-voltage-activated calcium channels are referred to as 'T'
type because their currents are both transient, owing to fast
inactivation, and tiny, owing to small conductance. T-type channels are
thought to be involved in pacemaker activity, low-threshold calcium
spikes, neuronal oscillations and resonance, and rebound burst firing.

CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences related to calcium channels,
Perez-Reyes et al. (1998) identified a partial human cDNA encoding a
novel channel that they designated alpha-1G or Ca(V)T.1. The authors
used the partial cDNA to isolate additional human, rat, and mouse
alpha-1G cDNAs. Northern blot analysis of human and rat tissues
indicated that the alpha-1G gene was expressed as an 8.5-kb mRNA
predominantly in brain. An additional 9.7-kb transcript was also
detected. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, the rat alpha-1G channel
exhibited the properties of a low-voltage-activated T-type calcium
channel.

Jagannathan et al. (2002) found that multiple isoforms of CACNA1G and at
least 2 isoforms of CACNA1H (607904) are generated by alternative
splicing and are expressed in testis. In situ hybridization localized
transcripts both in germ cells and in other testis cell types. Within
cardiac tissue, both CACNA1G and CACNA1H were expressed in vascular
tissue and not in myocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

By whole-cell patch clamp, Jagannathan et al. (2002) detected T-type
voltage-operated Ca(2+) channel currents in isolated round spermatids.
Currents were consistent with those generated by CACNA1H or CACNA1G
channels.

By action potential clamp studies, Chemin et al. (2002) found
significant differences in the biochemical properties of CACNA1G,
CACNA1H, and CACNA1I (608230) following transient transfection in human
embryonic kidney cells. Using firing activities recorded in dissociated
rat cerebellar Purkinje neurons and thalamocortical relay neurons as
voltage-clamp waveforms, they showed that CACNA1I currents contributed
to sustained electrical activities, while CACNA1G and CACNA1H currents
generated short burst firing. Chemin et al. (2002) hypothesized that
each of the T-channel pore-forming subunits displays specific gating
properties that uniquely contribute to neuronal firing and that CACNA1I
channels provide pacemaker activity.

MAPPING

By FISH and radiation hybrid analysis, Perez-Reyes et al. (1998) mapped
the CACNA1G gene to 17q22. Using interspecific backcross analysis, they
mapped the mouse Cacna1g gene to the distal portion of chromosome 11, in
a region showing homology of synteny with 17q22.

ANIMAL MODEL

To investigate whether T-type Ca(2+) channels in thalamocortical relay
(TC) neurons are involved in the generation of spike-and-wave discharges
(SWDs), Kim et al. (2001) used gene targeting to generate a null
mutation of CACNA1G that encodes the pore-forming subunit of T-type
Ca(2+) channels. The knockout mice grew normally and were fertile.
General development of the brain and major organs appeared normal. Using
pharmacologic models, Kim et al. (2001) analyzed the ability of mutant
mice to generate SWDs. The thalamocortical relay neurons of the knockout
mice lacked the burst mode firing of action potentials, whereas they
showed the normal pattern of tonic mode firing. The knockout thalamus
was specifically resistant to the generation of SWDs in response to
GABA-B receptor (see 603540) activation. Kim et al. (2001) concluded
that the modulation of the intrinsic firing pattern mediated by CACNA1G
T-type Ca(2+) channels plays a critical role in the generation of GABA-B
receptor-mediated SWDs in the thalamocortical pathway, the hallmark of
absence seizures.

Sensations from viscera, like fullness, easily become painful if the
stimulus persists. Kim et al. (2003) demonstrated that mice lacking
alpha 1G T-type calcium channels show hyperalgesia to visceral pain.
Thalamic infusion of a T-type blocker induced similar hyperalgesia in
wildtype mice. In response to visceral pain, the ventroposterolateral
thalamic neurons evoked a surge of single spikes, which then slowly
decayed as T type-dependent burst spikes gradually increased. In
alpha-1G-deficient neurons, the single-spike response persisted without
burst spikes. Kim et al. (2003) concluded that T-type calcium channels
underlie an antinociceptive mechanism operating in the thalamus and that
their findings support the idea that burst firing plays a critical role
in sensory gating in the thalamus.

;;ENOLASE, ALPHA;;
PHOSPHOPYRUVATE HYDRATASE; PPH
CRYSTALLIN, TAU, INCLUDED;;
ENOLASE, NONNEURONAL, INCLUDED; NNE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Enolase is a glycolytic enzyme (2-phospho-D-glycerate hydrolyase; EC
4.2.1.11). Each of the 3 ENO isoenzymes is a homodimer composed of 2
alpha (ENO1), 2 gamma (ENO2; 131360), or 2 beta (ENO3; 131370) subunits.
Isoenzyme alpha (ENO1) is present in most tissues, whereas the beta form
(ENO3) is localized to muscle and the gamma form (ENO2) is found only in
nervous tissue (summary by Giallongo et al., 1986).

CLONING

Giallongo et al. (1986) cloned and sequenced a full-length cDNA for
human alpha-enolase. Its coding region was found to be 1,299 bases long.
The 433-amino acid protein shows 67% homology to yeast enolase and 94%
homology to rat nonneural enolase.

Wistow et al. (1988) presented evidence for the remarkable conclusion
that alpha-enolase is encoded by the same gene that encodes
tau-crystallin, a lens structural protein.

GENE STRUCTURE

Giallongo et al. (1990) determined that the ENO1 gene contains 12 exons.

MAPPING

Giblett et al. (1974) observed an electrophoretic variant of red cell
PPH among Cree Indians. Linkage was found with the Rhesus locus. Since
the Rh locus has been assigned to chromosome 1 and since cell
hybridization studies assign the PPH locus to chromosome 1, the new data
are consistent. The Goss-Harris method of mapping combines features of
recombinational study in families and synteny tests in hybrid cells. As
applied to chromosome 1, the method shows that AK2 and UMPK are distal
to PGM1 and that the order of the loci is PGM1: UMPK: (AK2, alpha-FUC):
ENO1 (Goss and Harris, 1977). Comings (1972) and Ohno (1973) suggested
that during vertebrate evolution tetraploidization occurred 2-3 hundred
million years ago and that chromosomal events that tend to preserve
ancestral linkage groups, such as Robertsonian fusions, inversions and
gene duplications, have been favored. Demonstration of linkage of
homologous genes supports this hypothesis.

D'Ancona et al. (1977) regionalized ENO1 to 1pter-p36.13. Lalley et al.
(1978) demonstrated synteny of enolase, PGD (172200), PGM1 (171900), and
AK2 (103020) on chromosome 4 of the mouse; they are on 1p of man.

- Pseudogene

Feo et al. (1990) concluded that there is a single alpha-enolase
pseudogene in the human genome. This intronless, processed pseudogene
was mapped to chromosome 1 by Southern blot analysis of rodent-human
hybrid cell DNAs; thus, it is on the same chromosome as the functional
gene. Ribaudo et al. (1996) confirmed the assignment of ENO1P to
chromosome 1. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, they found that it
is located on 1q41-q42, whereas the functional gene is located on the
short arm of that chromosome.

GENE FUNCTION

Lachant et al. (1986) and Lachant and Tanaka (1987) reported 4
generations of a Caucasian family with hereditary red cell enolase
deficiency. Partial deficiency in this kindred behaved as an autosomal
dominant and was associated with a spherocytic phenotype, although a
normal acidified glycerol lysis test suggested that the spherocytes of
enolase deficiency are different from those of hereditary spherocytosis
(see 182900). Clinical expression of enolase deficiency varied in this
family. Some had slightly low hematocrit with elevated reticulocytes,
while others had no evidence of anemia or hemolysis.

To identify the autoantigens related to Hashimoto encephalopathy, a rare
autoimmune disease associated with Hashimoto thyroiditis (140300), Ochi
et al. (2002) developed a human brain proteome map using 2-dimensional
electrophoresis and applied it to the immunoscreening of brain proteins
that react with autoantibodies in affected patients. They thereby
identified alpha-enolase as the autoantigen in that disorder.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Muller et al. (2012) proposed that homozygous deletions in passenger
genes in cancer deletions can expose cancer-specific therapeutic
vulnerabilities when the collaterally deleted gene is a member of a
functionally redundant family of genes carrying out an essential
function. The glycolytic gene ENO1 in the 1p36 locus is deleted in
glioblastoma, which is tolerated by the expression of ENO2 (131360).
Muller et al. (2012) showed that short hairpin RNA-mediated silencing of
ENO2 selectively inhibits growth, survival, and the tumorigenic
potential of ENO1-deleted GBM cells, and that the enolase inhibitor
phosphonoacetohydroxamate is selectively toxic to ENO1-deleted GBM cells
relative to ENO1-intact GBM cells or normal astrocytes. Muller et al.
(2012) suggested that the principle of collateral vulnerability should
be applicable to other passenger-deleted genes encoding functionally
redundant essential activities and provide an effective treatment
strategy for cancers containing such genomic events.

180490	TITLE *180490 RIBOPHORIN II; RPN2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The RPN2 gene encodes ribophorin II, which is involved in ribosome
binding. Ribophorin I (RPN1; 180470) and RPN2 are abundant, highly
conserved glycoproteins located exclusively in the membranes of the
rough endoplasmic reticulum (Crimaudo et al., 1987).

CLONING

Using probes derived from a human liver expression library, Crimaudo et
al. (1987) isolated and sequenced full-length human cDNA clones encoding
ribophorins I and II. The cDNA clones hybridized to mRNA species of 2.5
kb and encoded polypeptides of 68.5 and 69.3 kD, respectively. Sequence
comparisons and immunoblotting with specific antibodies showed both
proteins to be highly conserved throughout a variety of species.
However, no relationship between the 2 proteins could be deduced from
their primary sequences.

MAPPING

Using cDNAs in the study of a panel of somatic cell hybrids, Barton et
al. (1987) mapped RPN2 to chromosome 20. Loffler et al. (1991) mapped
the RPN2 gene to 20q12-q13.1 by in situ hybridization.

GENE FUNCTION

Kelleher et al. (1992) reported that mammalian oligosaccharyltransferase
activity is associated with a protein complex composed of ribophorin I,
ribophorin II, and a 48-kD oligosaccharyltransferase protein (602202).

Among 44 women with breast cancer (114480), Honma et al. (2008) observed
a significant association (p = 0.0052) between increased expression of
RPN2 in cancer tissue and decreased clinical response to the
antimicrotubule chemotherapeutic agent docetaxel. Small interfering RNA
(siRNA) targeting RPN2 significantly promoted docetaxel-dependent
apoptosis and cell growth inhibition of docetaxel-resistant human breast
cancer cells in vitro. In vivo atelocollagen delivery of RPN2 siRNA
significantly reduced drug-resistant tumor growth in mice given
docetaxel. Further studies indicated that RPN2 conferred drug resistance
via increased glycosylation of P-glycoproteins. Honma et al. (2008)
concluded that RPN2 siRNA introduction may hypersensitize cancer cell
responses to chemotherapeutic agents.

612533	TITLE *612533 THAP DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 4; THAP4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases, Roussigne et al. (2003) identified several
proteins containing an N-terminal THAP domain, including THAP4. The THAP
domain of the deduced 577-amino acid THAP4 protein includes a C2CH
signature, an AVPTIF box, and several other conserved amino acids.

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the THAP4 gene to chromosome 2q37.3 based on an
alignment of the THAP4 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF132970) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

606397	TITLE *606397 CLARIN 1; CLRN1
;;USH3A GENE; USH3A;;
USH3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By EST database searching and sequencing of the Usher syndrome type IIIA
(276902) critical region on chromosome 3q21-q25, Joensuu et al. (2001)
identified several genes, including CLRN1, which they called USH3A gene.
The USH3A protein has a cytosolic N terminus, 2 helical transmembrane
domains, and an endoplasmic reticulum membrane retention signal, TKGH,
in the C terminus. Northern blot analysis detected ubiquitous expression
of 3 USH3A transcripts of 4.5 kb, 1.4 kb, and 2.0 kb in adult human
tissues. RT-PCR analysis detected expression in retina. No expression of
USH3A was detected in human lymphoblasts by either method.

Fields et al. (2002) found that the USH3A gene encodes a deduced
232-amino acid protein. The mature form of the protein is predicted to
contain 3 transmembrane domains and 204 residues.

Adato et al. (2002) assembled a 500-kb genomic interval spanning the
USH3A gene and determined the full-length coding sequence of the USH3A
gene, expected to encode a 232-amino acid protein with 4 transmembrane
domains, which they named clarin-1. Adato et al. (2002) detected
expression of USH3A in retina, skeletal muscle, testis, and olfactory
epithelium. In mouse inner ear, expression was specific to the inner and
outer hair cells of the organ of Corti and to the spiral ganglion cells.

By sequencing CLRN1 clones obtained from a human retina cDNA library,
Vastinsalo et al. (2011) identified 10 alternative splice variants in
addition to the main variant, which contains exons 0, 2, and 3 and
encodes a 232-amino acid protein. Other transcripts containing ORFs were
predicted to encode proteins of 30 to 245 amino acids, and all but the
30-amino acid peptide have 1 to 4 transmembrane segments. Some splice
variants include premature stop codons and may be untranslated. EST
database analysis suggested that exon 2 may also be spliced onto
additional downstream exons. PCR analysis detected weak expression of
the main CLRN1 variant in most tissues examined. The variant encoding
the 245-amino acid protein was detected in retina, cochlea, heart,
brain, placenta, lung, skeletal muscle, pancreas, and ovary.

GENE STRUCTURE

Joensuu et al. (2001) determined that the CLRN1 gene contains 4 exons
spanning approximately 18 kb of genomic DNA. They also identified a
splice variant, designated isoform b, comprising an additional 87-bp
exon (exon 1b).

Fields et al. (2002) provided a revised structure of the CLRN1 gene,
including a new translation start site, 5-prime untranslated region, and
a transcript encoding a 232-amino acid protein. They stated that no
portion of exon 1, exon 1b, or exon 4 was present in their revised CLRN1
cDNA.

Adato et al. (2002) determined the genomic structure and alternative
transcripts of the CLRN1 gene. A longer transcript than those reported
by Joensuu et al. (2001) began with a newly identified exon 0, continued
with exon 2, had exons 3 and 4 transcribed together with their
intervening intron, but did not include the previously identified exons
1 and 1b.

Vastinsalo et al. (2011) determined that the CLRN1 gene contains at
least 8 exons, which they termed exons 0, 0b, 1, 1b, 2, 2b, 3a, and 3b.
Exons 3a and 3b are joined, along with the intervening intron, to form
exon 3 in the main splice variant. The region upstream of exon 1, which
is not transcribed in the main variant, contains a CpG island. Regions
upstream of exons 0, 1, 2, and 3 contain putative transcription
factor-binding sites. Functional analysis revealed that highest promoter
activity was associated with the region upstream of exon 0. A
pseudogene, CLRN1OS, is located on the opposite strand and has a 5-prime
UTR running in the opposite direction and overlapping the 5-prime UTR of
the CLRN1 gene.

GENE FAMILY

Adato et al. (2002) performed sequence database searches and identified
2 additional clarin-1 human paralogs: clarin-2 and clarin-3. No
orthologs were identified in the genomes of prokaryotes, yeast, plants,
nematodes, and insects, suggesting that this gene family is limited to
vertebrates. Four transmembrane domains, conserved sequence motifs, and
a single glycosylation consensus site between TM1 and TM2 characterized
the clarin family members, with a total of 14 identified clarins in
different species. In a wider context the clarins appeared to belong to
a large superfamily of small integral membrane glycoproteins with 4
transmembrane domains, including connexins and claudins, previously
shown to be involved in forms of deafness. The only protein showing
significant sequence similarity to the 3 clarins was stargazin, a
cellular synapse protein encoded by the CACNG2 gene (602911). Because of
the sequence homology to stargazin, Adato et al. (2002) suggested a role
for clarin-1 in hair cell and photoreceptor cell synapses.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Joensuu et al. (2001) mapped the CLRN1 gene to
chromosome 3q21-q25. Fields et al. (2002) stated 3q25 as the cytogenetic
location of the CLRN1 gene.

Fields et al. (2002) showed that the orthologous gene in the mouse is on
chromosome 3 and in rat on chromosome 2. They identified 2 human
paralogs on chromosomes 4 and 10.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Usher Syndrome Type IIIA

In 2 Finnish families reported by Sankila et al. (1995) and Joensuu et
al. (1996) and an Italian family reported by Gasparini et al. (1998)
with Usher syndrome type IIIA (276902), Joensuu et al. (2001) identified
mutations in the USH3A gene (606397.0001-606397.0003).

Fields et al. (2002) described 4 novel disease-causing mutations in the
USH3A gene, including one that appeared to be relatively common in the
Ashkenazi Jewish population (N48K; 606937.0004).

Adato et al. (2002) detected 3 USH3A mutations among 11 affected
individuals from 6 families with Usher syndrome type IIIA. They were a
missense mutation (606397.0004), a nonsense mutation (606397.0006), and
a 23-bp deletion (606397.0007), likely rendering clarin-1 functionally
inactive.

Aller et al. (2004) screened for mutations in the USH3A gene in Spanish
patients with Usher syndrome and found mutations in only 2 families.
They identified 1 patient with Usher syndrome type IIIA who was
homozygous for a C40G mutation (606397.0008). They noted that only 1
other mutation had been reported in the USH3A gene in Spanish families
with Usher syndrome (606397.0006). These 2 families accounted for only
1.7% of Spanish families with Usher syndrome.

- Retinitis Pigmentosa 61

In affected members of 2 consanguineous Pakistani families segregating
nonsyndromic autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (RP61; 614180),
Khan et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for missense mutations in the
CLRN1 gene (606397.0009-606397.0010), both of which occurred in a
transmembrane domain. Khan et al. (2011) concluded that these
RP-associated mutations might represent hypomorphic mutations, because
the substituted amino acids located in the transmembrane domains
remained polar, whereas more severe changes had been detected in
patients with USH3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Geng et al. (2009) developed a Clrn1 -/- mouse model for Usher syndrome
type IIIA. Clrn1 was expressed as early as embryonic day 16.5 in the
auditory and vestibular hair cells and associated ganglionic neurons,
with its expression being higher in outer hair cells than inner hair
cells. Clrn1 -/- mice showed early-onset hearing loss that rapidly
progressed to severe levels. Two to 3 weeks after birth (postnatal day
14 to 21), Clrn1-null mice showed elevated auditory-evoked brainstem
response (ABR) thresholds and prolonged peak and interpeak latencies. By
postnatal day 21, approximately 70% of Clrn1-null mice had no detectable
ABR, and by postnatal day 30, these mice were deaf. Distortion product
otoacoustic emissions were not recordable from Clrn1-null mice.
Vestibular function in Clrn1-null mice mirrored the cochlear phenotype,
although it deteriorated more gradually than cochlear function.
Disorganization of outer hair cell stereocilia was seen as early as
postnatal day 2 and by postnatal day 21 outer hair cell loss was
observed. Geng et al. (2009) concluded that CLRN1 is necessary for hair
cell function and associated neural activation.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
USHER SYNDROME, TYPE IIIA
CLRN1, TYR176TER

Fields et al. (2002) demonstrated that the Fin(major) USH3A mutation in
exon 3 of the USH3A gene, which had been identified by Joensuu et al.
(2001) as 300C-T (TYR100TER), should be referred to as 528T-G, resulting
in a tyr176-to-ter substitution. Joensuu et al. (2001) had identified
homozygosity for this mutation in a Finnish family segregating Usher
syndrome type IIIA (276902) and found it in a further 52 Finnish
patients. Fields et al. (2002) found this mutation in 11 of 28 mutated
alleles from affected individuals of Finnish and other northern European
ancestry.

.0002
USHER SYNDROME, TYPE IIIA
CLRN1, MET120LYS

In 4 Finnish patients from 2 families segregating Usher syndrome type
IIIA (276902), Joensuu et al. (2001) identified heterozygosity for the
Fin(major) mutation (606397.0001) and a T-to-A transversion resulting in
a met-to-lys substitution. Whereas Joensuu et al. (2001) referred to
this mutation, designated Fin(minor), as 131T-A (MET44LYS), Fields et
al. (2002) showed that this mutation should be referred to as 359T-A
(met120 to lys; M120K). The mutation occurred in exon 1 of the USH3A
gene.

.0003
USHER SYNDROME, TYPE IIIA
CLRN1, 3-BP DEL, 459ATT

In a consanguineous Italian family segregating Usher syndrome type IIIA
(276902), Joensuu et al. (2001) identified a 3-bp deletion in exon 3 of
the USH3A gene, resulting in the substitution of one methionine for
isoleucine and leucine. Fields et al. (2002) showed that this mutation,
referred to as 231-233delATT by Joensuu et al. (2001), should be
referred to as 459-461delATT.

.0004
USHER SYNDROME, TYPE IIIA
CLRN1, ASN48LYS

Of a total of 28 mutated alleles of the USH3A gene detected by Fields et
al. (2002) in patients with Usher syndrome type IIIA (276902), 11 had a
missense mutation, asn48 to lys (N48K), due to a 144T-G transversion in
exon 1. The mutation occurred only in Ashkenazi Jewish subjects and was
present in homozygous state in all except 1, in whom it was found in
compound heterozygous state with a leu150-to-pro mutation (L150P;
606397.0005).

Adato et al. (2002) detected the N48K missense mutation in 6 affected
individuals from 4 unrelated families of Eastern European Jewish origin.
Five patients were homozygous, while 1 patient carried the substitution
only on 1 allele and the second USH3A mutation was not detected. Shared
microsatellite and SNP haplotypes on carrier chromosomes suggested the
existence of a founder effect for this mutation.

In a cohort of 40 Ashkenazi Jewish patients with Usher syndrome, Ness et
al. (2003) found that the 16 (40%) who were clinically classified as
having Usher syndrome type III were homozygous for the N48K mutation.
The carrier frequency of N48K was 0.7% (95% CI = 0.0-1.6%) among
Ashkenazi Jews in the New York area, with a predicted Usher syndrome
type III prevalence of 1.2 per 100,000. Despite the genetic homogeneity
of Usher syndrome type III in this group, there was a wide range of
phenotypic severity displayed by the N48K homozygotes. Age at onset of
the auditory phenotype varied from infancy to more than 35 years. A
56-year-old woman had onset of the ocular phenotype in early childhood
ending with no useful vision, whereas hearing loss began after age 35
years, progressing to moderate to severe.

.0005
USHER SYNDROME, TYPE IIIA
CLRN1, LEU150PRO

In an Ashkenazi Jewish subject with type IIIA Usher syndrome (276902)
who was living in the United States, Fields et al. (2002) found that the
common Jewish mutation asn48 to lys (606397.0004) was combined, in
compound heterozygous state, with a 449T-C transition in exon 3,
resulting in a leu150-to-pro (L150P) mutation.

.0006
USHER SYNDROME, TYPE IIIA
CLRN1, TYR63TER

Adato et al. (2002) detected a 189C-A substitution, which was expected
to cause a tyr63-to-ter (Y63X) nonsense mutation in homozygous state in
3 sibs with Usher syndrome type IIIA (276902) from a nonconsanguineous
Spanish family.

Aller et al. (2004) stated that the family with the Y63X mutation
reported by Adato et al. (2002) could be diagnosed clinically as Usher
syndrome type I because hearing impairment was profound and stable.
Aller et al. (2004) considered that progressive hearing loss is not the
definitive parameter in distinguishing Usher syndrome type III from
Usher syndrome types I and II.

.0007
USHER SYNDROME, TYPE IIIA
CLRN1, 23-BP DEL, NT187

In 2 sibs with Usher syndrome type IIIA (276902) from a
nonconsanguineous family of Yemenite Jewish origin, Adato et al. (2002)
detected a 23-bp deletion in homozygous state. The deletion spanned
nucleotides 187-209 downstream from the first methionine codon, and was
predicted to cause a frameshift at amino acid 63 and stop codon after 25
amino acids.

.0008
USHER SYNDROME, TYPE IIIA
CLRN1, CYS40GLY

In a patient with type IIIA Usher syndrome, Aller et al. (2004)
identified homozygosity for a 118T-G transversion, resulting in a
cys40-to-gly (C40G) mutation in the USH3A gene. Both parents and an
unaffected sister were heterozygous for the mutation.

.0009
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 61
CLRN1, LEU154TRP

In affected members of a consanguineous Pakistani family with
nonsyndromic retinitis pigmentosa (RP61; 614180), Khan et al. (2011)
identified homozygosity for a 461T-G transversion in exon 3 of the CLRN1
gene, resulting in a leu154-to-trp (L154W) substitution in a
transmembrane domain. Subcellular localization studies demonstrated
retention of the mutant protein in the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas
the wildtype protein was mainly present at the cell membrane. The
mutation was not found in 81 unrelated Pakistani RP patients or in 90
ethnically matched control individuals.

.0010
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 61
CLRN1, PRO31LEU

In affected members of a consanguineous Pakistani family with
nonsyndromic retinitis pigmentosa (RP61; 614180), Khan et al. (2011)
identified homozygosity for a 92C-T transition in exon 1 of the CLRN1
gene, resulting in a pro31-to-leu (P31L) substitution in a transmembrane
domain. Subcellular localization studies demonstrated retention of the
mutant protein in the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas the wildtype
protein was mainly present at the cell membrane. The mutation was not
found in 81 unrelated Pakistani RP patients or in 90 ethnically matched
control individuals.

603451	TITLE *603451 LIM DOMAIN-BINDING 1; LDB1
;;CARBOXYL-TERMINAL LIM DOMAIN PROTEIN 2; CLIM2;;
NUCLEAR LIM DOMAIN INTERACTOR; NLI
DESCRIPTION For general information on LIM domain-binding factors, see CLIM1
(603450).

CLONING

Semina et al. (1998) isolated 2 human genes encoding LIM domain-binding
factors, CLIM1 and CLIM2. The 2 genes have a very high level of identity
to each other and to the homologs in other species. CLIM2 encodes a
375-amino acid protein.

Using FACS analysis of adult mouse bone marrow and fetal liver cells, Li
et al. (2010) showed that Ldb1 was expressed in hematopoietic stem
cells, with lower levels in myeloid and megakaryocyte progenitor cells.
Ldb1 was expressed at all stages of erythroid development.

GENE FUNCTION

Sum et al. (2002) found that LDB1 associated with a complex containing
LMO4 (603129), CTIP (604124), and BRCA1 (113705) in transfected human
embryonic kidney cells.

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis, protein pull-down assays, and
coimmunoprecipitation assays, Han et al. (2005) found that human LMO2
(180385) interacted with human BEX2 (300691). Electrophoretic mobility
shift assays showed that BEX2 and LMO2 were part of a DNA-binding
complex that recognized the E-box element. Other components of this
complex included NSCL2 (NHLH2; 162361) and LDB1.

Abrahams et al. (2007) used 2 sets of microarray analyses followed by
selective in situ hybridization to identify differentially expressed
genes in the superior temporal gyrus and cerebral cortex in midgestation
human fetal brains. LDB1 was consistently enriched in the superior
temporal gyrus posterior temporal cortex, and perisylvian cortex.
Abrahams et al. (2007) suggested that LDB1 may be involved in asymmetric
patterning of the developing human cortex.

MAPPING

By PCR analysis of a Genebridge 4 radiation hybrid panel, Semina et al.
(1998) mapped the CLIM2 gene to 10q24-q25. Yamashita et al. (1998)
mapped the mouse Lbd1 gene to a region of conserved homology in distal
chromosome 19.

ANIMAL MODEL

Li et al. (2010) reported that Ldb1 -/- mice died between embryonic days
9 and 10. They found that Ldb1 -/- embryonic stem cells generated
myeloid, but not erythroid, lineage cells. Conditional deletion of Ldb1
showed that it was required for fetal and adult erythropoiesis, as well
as for megakaryopoiesis.

611906	TITLE *611906 FIBRONECTIN TYPE III DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 5; FNDC5
;;FRCP2
IRISIN, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database searching with the sequence of mouse Fndc4 (611905) as
query, Teufel et al. (2002) identified mouse Fndc5. The deduced
203-amino acid protein, like the Fndc4 protein, contains an N-terminal
signal peptide, a fibronectin type III domain, and a transmembrane
domain. The 2 proteins share 60% identity in the FNIII domain and 86% in
the transmembrane domain. Also by database analysis, Teufel et al.
(2002) identified human FNDC5, which shares over 95% amino acid homology
with mouse Fndc5. They found no homologs in invertebrates. Northern blot
analysis of multiple mouse tissues detected highest expression of Fndc5
in adult brain and heart, and low expression in lung, skeletal muscle,
and testis. Northern blot analysis of mouse embryonic mRNA first
detected Fndc5 expression at embryonic day 11, with strongest expression
at E15 and decreasing expression at E17. In situ hybridization
demonstrated expression of Fndc5 in the fore- and midbrain, as well as
in the brachial arches and the heart. Overexpression of a GFP-Fndc5
fusion protein in COS cells showed localization predominantly in the
endoplasmic reticulum, with small amounts in the plasma membrane.

GENE STRUCTURE

Irisin is a 22-kD cleaved fragment that comprises most of the
fibronectin-3 domain of FNDC5 and is comprised of 110 amino acids
(Bostrom et al., 2012). Mouse and human irisin are 100% identical.

GENE FUNCTION

In mouse, Bostrom et al. (2012) demonstrated that PGC1-alpha (604517)
expression in muscle stimulates an increase in expression of FNDC5, a
membrane protein that is cleaved and secreted as a novel hormone,
irisin. Irisin acts on white adipose cells in culture and in vivo to
stimulate UCP1 (113730) expression and a broad program of brown fat-like
development. Irisin is induced with exercise in mice and humans, and
mildly increased irisin levels in the blood cause an increase in energy
expenditure in mice with no changes in movement or food intake. This
results in improvements in obesity and glucose homeostasis. Bostrom et
al. (2012) postulated that irisin could be therapeutic for human
metabolic disease and other disorders that are improved with exercise.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the FNDC5
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP SHGC-74545). Teufel et al. (2002) mapped the
mouse Fndc5 gene to chromosome 4.

603695	TITLE *603695 GUANYLATE CYCLASE 1, SOLUBLE, BETA-2; GUCY1B2
;;GUANYLATE CYCLASE, SOLUBLE, BETA-2;;
GCS-BETA-2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Nitric oxide-sensitive guanylyl cyclase (EC 4.6.1.2) is a heterodimeric
enzyme consisting of an alpha and a beta subunit. The enzyme converts
GTP into the second messenger cGMP and plays a major role in the
cardiovascular system as a receptor for nitric oxide. Yuen et al. (1990)
isolated rat cDNAs encoding a guanylyl cyclase beta-subunit that they
designated GCS-beta-2. The predicted 682-amino acid rat protein shares
27% identity with rat GCS-beta-1 (GUCY1B3; 139397). Unlike other
guanylyl cyclases, GCS-beta-2 contains an 86-amino acid C-terminal
extension with a consensus sequence for
isoprenylation/carboxymethylation. Northern blot analysis indicated that
GCS-beta-2 is expressed at higher levels in rat kidney and liver,
whereas GCS-beta-1 is preferentially expressed in lung and brain. By PCR
with primers based on the sequence of rat GCS-beta-2, Behrends et al.
(1999) isolated a partial human heart GUCY1B2 cDNA.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization and by linkage, Behrends et al.
(1999) mapped the GUCY1B2 gene to 13q14.3. By in situ hybridization,
Malterer et al. (1999) confirmed the assignment of the GUCY1B2 gene to
13q14.2-q14.3.

612185	TITLE *612185 CASK-INTERACTING PROTEIN 2; CASKIN2
;;KIAA1139
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Hirosawa et al. (1999) cloned CASKIN2, which they designated
KIAA1139. The deduced protein contains motifs associated with cell
signaling. RT-PCR ELISA detected ubiquitous expression of CASKIN2, with
highest levels in fetal and adult liver.

By affinity purification of rat brain proteins with a GST fusion protein
of the N-terminal CaM kinase domain of CASK (300172), an adaptor protein
of the plasma membrane, Tabuchi et al. (2002) isolated a novel 180-kD
protein. By database analysis, they identified KIAA1306 (CASKIN1;
612184) as the cDNA encoding this protein as well as the highly related
CASKIN2 cDNA. Tabuchi et al. (2002) found that Caskin proteins are
highly conserved evolutionarily. Each has a multidomain structure in
which the N terminus has 6 ankyrin repeats, a single SH3 domain, and 2
SAM domains, and the C terminus contains a long proline-rich sequence
and a short conserved domain. Human CASKIN2 encodes a deduced
1,202-amino acid protein.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Hirosawa et al. (1999) mapped the CASKIN2
gene to chromosome 17.

602428	TITLE *602428 HYALURONAN SYNTHASE 3; HAS3
DESCRIPTION For background information on hyaluronan (HA) and HA synthases, such as
HAS3, see HAS1 (601463).

CLONING

By degenerate PCR, Spicer et al. (1997) isolated a genomic fragment of
human HAS3 and genomic and cDNA clones of mouse Has3. The amino acid
sequences encoded by the partial human HAS3 fragment and the
corresponding region of mouse Has3 are 99% conserved. The authors noted
that the high degree of sequence conservation between specific human and
mouse HASs contrasts with the lower level of identity between HASs
within a species, suggesting an evolutionary conservation of
functionally important residues and differences in the mode of action of
the various HASs. The predicted 554-amino acid mouse Has3 protein has
several consensus HA-binding motifs and multiple transmembrane domains,
with 2 at the N terminus and a cluster at the C terminus. Northern blot
analysis of the mouse embryo showed that Has3 is predominantly expressed
at late gestation as a major, approximately 6.0- to 6.5-kb transcript
and a minor, approximately 4.0-kb transcript.

Monslow et al. (2003) identified a splice variant of human HAS3.

GENE FUNCTION

Spicer et al. (1997) found that expression of mouse Has3 in COS-1 cells
led to high levels of HA biosynthesis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Monslow et al. (2003) determined that the HAS3 gene has 4 exons and
spans about 12.5 kb. Exons 1 and 4 are subject to alternative splicing.
HAS3 has 2 promoter regions, and the 500-bp region upstream of each
transcription start site contains either 46 or 56 transcription
factor-binding sites. Upstream of exon 1 is a (GT)n repeat sequence.

MAPPING

By PCR screening somatic cell hybrid DNAs and a YAC contig, Spicer et
al. (1997) localized the human HAS3 gene to chromosome 16q22.1. By
interspecific backcross analysis, they mapped the mouse Has3 gene to
chromosome 8. Since HAS1 (601463), HAS2 (601636), and HAS3 are located
on different autosomes, Spicer et al. (1997) suggested that the HAS gene
family arose comparatively early in vertebrate evolution by sequential
duplication of an ancestral HAS gene.

602142	TITLE *602142 PHOSPHOLIPASE C, DELTA-1; PLCD1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) acts as a signal
transducer that generates 2 second messengers, diacylglycerol and
inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, by hydrolyzing inositol phospholipids. PLC
comprises a diverse family of enzymes that differ in structure and
tissue distribution (Berridge, 1993).

CLONING

By screening a human aortic smooth muscle cDNA library with a probe
derived from a rat C6 glioma cell PLC-delta-1 cDNA, Cheng et al. (1995)
cloned a PLCD1 cDNA. The deduced 756-amino acid protein shares 95%
sequence homology with the rat protein. It contains a pleckstrin
homology (PH) domain and the conserved X and Y domains of PLC proteins.
It is distinguished from PLC-gamma (see 172420) by lack of the SH2 and
SH3 domains that are essential for activation of PLC-gamma by tyrosine
protein kinases, and from PLC-beta (see 600810) by lack of the
C-terminal region of PLC-beta that is responsible for binding and
activation by G proteins. Northern blot analysis detected ubiquitous
expression of a 3.8-kb transcript, with highest expression in lung,
heart, pancreas, skeletal muscle, and kidney. An additional 7.5-kb
transcript was detected in skeletal muscle.

Kiuru et al. (2011) performed immunohistochemical analysis of human
fetal nail sections and detected prominent localization of PLCD1 in the
nail matrix and nail bed. In addition, real-time quantitative PCR
analysis demonstrated expression of PLCD1 mRNA in human skin and hair
follicles.

MAPPING

Lyu et al. (1996) mapped the PLCD1 gene to chromosome 3 by means of a
human/rodent somatic cell panel.

In the course of a large-scale sequencing analysis of genomic DNA in the
vicinity of a homozygous deletion on chromosome 3p found in a lung
cancer cell line, Ishikawa et al. (1997) found that the PLCD1 was
located just distal to the region removed by the deletion. By
fluorescence in situ hybridization, they localized the PLCD1 gene to
3p22-p21.3.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ishikawa et al. (1997) determined that the PLCD1 gene contains 15 exons
and spans about 22 kb.

GENE FUNCTION

When human PLCD1 was expressed in E. coli, the recombinant enzyme
displayed high phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) hydrolyzing
activity in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner (Cheng et al., 1995).

Using semiquantitative RT-PCR, Hu et al. (2009) found that expression of
PLCD1 was silenced or reduced in a significant number of gastric cancer
cell lines compared with normal gastric tissues. Methylation-specific
PCR showed that silenced or reduced PLCD1 expression was associated with
methylation of the PLCD1 CpG island. In 98 primary gastric cancers,
PLCD1 methylation significantly correlated with high-stage tumors.
Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed reduced PLCD1 protein levels in
primary gastric carcinomas compared with normal gastric mucosa.
Transfection of PLCD1 into gastric tumor cell lines had no effect on
cell proliferation or cell cycle arrest, but it suppressed colony
formation and cell migration and reduced cytoskeletal changes associated
with cell migration. Expression of PLCD1 also reduced the metastatic
potential of a gastric cancer cell line following injection into nude
mice. Hu et al. (2009) concluded that PLCD1 functions as a tumor
suppressor involved in gastric cancers.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Shimohama et al. (1998) examined the entire sequences corresponding to
protein-coding exons 2-15 of the hamster PLC-delta-1 gene in genomic DNA
derived from the leukocytes of 13 unrelated patients with early-onset
sporadic Alzheimer disease (104300). In 1 of these patients whose
clinical features and course did not differ from those of the other 12
cases, they found a change of codon CGC (arg) to CAC (his), located in
the pleckstrin homology domain of the PLCD1 gene. They stated that this
was the first mutation found in the human PLC genes. Site-directed
mutagenesis of the glutathione-S-transferase (GST/PLCD1) fusion protein
changing arg105 to his resulted in a 4-fold decrease in the affinity of
specific binding and a reduction in hydrolyzing activity to about 40% of
that of the wildtype enzyme. This remarkable loss of function could be
interpreted in terms of a conformational change in the pleckstrin
homology domain. Shimohama et al. (1998) found that the arg105-to-his
mutation was present in heterozygous state in the patient with AD. The
mutation was not found in DNA extracted from leukocytes of 23 unrelated
patients with familial AD, 23 unrelated patients with early-onset
sporadic AD, 46 unrelated patients with late-onset sporadic AD, and 456
nondemented control subjects. Thus the change did not appear to be a
common polymorphism. However, determination of the possible pathologic
role required transgenic studies of the mutant gene to determine the
role of the enzyme and the mutation and a search for other mutations in
the pleckstrin homology domain of PLC genes in human subjects with
genetic disorders. They pointed out that mutations in the pleckstrin
homology domain of the BTK gene (300300) occur in patients with Bruton
agammaglobulinemia (300755).

- Nonsyndromic Congenital Nail Disorder 3

In 4 Pakistani families with leukonychia totalis, also referred to as
nonsyndromic congenital nail disorder-3 (NDNC3; 151600), mapping to
chromosome 3p22-p21.3, 2 of which demonstrated autosomal recessive
inheritance and 2 of which were consistent with autosomal dominant
inheritance, Kiuru et al. (2011) analyzed candidate genes and identified
homozygosity or heterozygosity for nonsense, splice site, and missense
mutations in the PLCD1 gene (602142.0001-602142.0004). Kiuru et al.
(2011) noted that the phenomenon of recessive and dominant mutations in
the same gene resulting in a similar phenotype is very rare.

homozygosity for a 1309C-T transition in the PLCD1 gene, resulting in an
arg437-to-ter (R437X) substitution. The mutation was not found in 130

11 and exon 12 (1792-10delTGTAGTGGCC) in the PLCD1 gene, predicted to

;;MYH, CARDIAC; MYHC;;
MYOSIN, CARDIAC, HEAVY CHAIN, ALPHA; MYHCA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cardiac muscle myosin is one of the major components of the sarcomere,
the building block of the contractile system of cardiac muscle (summary
by Holm et al., 2011). The MYH6 gene encodes the alpha heavy chain
subunit of cardiac myosin (alpha-MHC), a fast ATPase primarily expressed
in atrial tissue.

CLONING

Kurabayashi et al. (1988) constructed and characterized 2 types of
myosin heavy chain cDNA clones from a fetal human heart cDNA library.
Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences showed 95.1 and 96.2%
homology, respectively. The carboxyl-terminal peptide and 3-prime
untranslated regions were highly divergent and specific. They showed
that one was transcribed exclusively in the atrium and therefore
represented the alpha form of MYHC, whereas the other was predominantly
expressed in the ventricle and therefore represented the beta form.

GENE FAMILY

The level of expression of fetal and adult MYH genes varies throughout
the life span of the animal and can be modulated reversibly by
physiologic conditions such as mechanical overload and level of
circulating hormones. Striking nucleotide sequence homology of the mRNAs
of adult cardiac, embryonic and adult skeletal MYH suggests that they
arose from a common ancestral gene (Mahdavi et al., 1982). (Mahdavi et
al. (1982) used the abbreviation MHC for myosin heavy chain, but this
presents confusion with the major histocompatibility complex.)

Mahdavi et al. (1984) found that in the rat the alpha and beta genes are
organized in tandem and span 50 kilobases of the chromosome. The
beta-MYHC gene (MYH7; 160760), predominantly expressed in late fetal
life, is located 4 kb upstream from the alpha-MYHC gene, predominantly
expressed in the adult. The 2 genes are closely related in nucleotide
sequence, suggesting that they have arisen by duplication of a common
ancestor, yet their expression in the ventricular myocardium is
regulated in an antithetic manner by thyroid hormone. The parallel to
hemoglobin genes in anatomic positioning in relation to expression in
ontogeny is obvious. The embryonic, newborn, and adult skeletal muscle
MYHC genes are also, it seems, organized in a head-to-tail fashion in
the order of their developmental expression. Unlike the hemoglobin and
immunoglobulin examples in which switches are unidirectional--a gene
switched off in a terminally differentiated cell cannot be switched on
again--the beta-MYHC gene can be switched on again either spontaneously
in older animals or experimentally in response to thyroid hormone
depletion/replacement or different mechanical stimuli. The alpha-MYHC
gene is expressed also in atrial muscle and the beta-MYHC gene in
skeletal slow-twitch muscle.

Buckingham et al. (1986) provided a summary of the actin (see 102540)
and myosin multigene families in mouse and man. In both mouse and man,
the cardiac and skeletal actin and myosin genes map to different
chromosomes (Robert et al., 1985). The only linkage observed is between
myosin heavy chain genes expressed sequentially during striated muscle
development. Thus, cardiac myosin heavy chain genes map to mouse
chromosome 14, whereas the embryonic or early fetal, perinatal and adult
myosin heavy chain genes expressed in skeletal muscle are present as a
gene cluster on mouse chromosome 11 (Weydert et al., 1985). This
suggests that cis-acting factors are important in the sequential
expression of these genes during development, whereas transacting
factors are implicated in the coexpression of genes in different
multigene families in a given phenotype. The myosin heavy chains are
coded by a multigene family consisting of at least 10 members. The heavy
chains for skeletal muscle myosin are coded by chromosome 17.

GENE STRUCTURE

Geisterfer-Lowrance et al. (1990) diagrammed the exon map of the cardiac
MYHC genes.

Epp et al. (1993) reported the complete nucleotide sequence of the human
MYH6 gene, encompassing 26,159 bp as well as the entire 4,484-bp 5-prime
flanking intergenic region. The MYH6 gene consists of 39 exons, 37 of
which contain coding information. The 5-prime untranslated region is
split into 3 exons, with the third exon containing the AUG translation
initiation codon. With the exception of intron 13 of the cardiac
beta-myosin heavy chain gene (MYH7), which is not present within the
alpha-isogene, all exon/intron boundaries are conserved.

GENE FUNCTION

Van Rooij et al. (2007) found that microRNA-208 (MIRN208; 611116), a
cardiac-specific microRNA encoded by intron 27 of the MYH6 gene, is
required for cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, fibrosis, and expression of MYH7
in response to stress and hypothyroidism.

In mice, adult cardiomyocytes primarily express alpha-myosin heavy chain
(alpha-MHC, also known as Myh6), whereas embryonic cardiomyocytes
express beta-MHC (also known as Myh7, 160760). Cardiac stress triggers
adult hearts to undergo hypertrophy and a shift from alpha-MHC to fetal
beta-MHC expression. Hang et al. (2010) showed that BRG1 (603254), a
chromatin-remodeling protein, has a critical role in regulating cardiac
growth, differentiation, and gene expression. In embryos, Brg1 promotes
myocyte proliferation by maintaining Bmp10 (608748) and suppressing
p57(kip2) (600856) expression. It preserves fetal cardiac
differentiation by interacting with histone deacetylases (HDACs; see
601241) and poly(ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP; 173870) to repress
alpha-MHC and activate beta-MHC. In adults, Brg1 (also known as Smarca4)
is turned off in cardiomyoctyes. It is reactivated by cardiac stresses
and forms a complex with its embryonic partners, HDAC and PARP, to
induce a pathologic alpha-MHC-to-beta-MHC shift. Preventing Brg1
reexpression decreases hypertrophy and reverses this MHC switch. BRG1 is
activated in certain patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, its
level correlating with disease severity and MHC changes. Hang et al.
(2010) concluded that their studies showed that BRG1 maintains
cardiomyocytes in an embryonic state, and demonstrated an epigenetic
mechanism by which 3 classes of chromatin-modifying factors, BRG1, HDAC,
and PARP, cooperate to control developmental and pathologic gene
expression.

MAPPING

Saez et al. (1987) used a gene-specific oligonucleotide to isolate the
beta-myosin heavy chain gene (which is expressed in both cardiac and
skeletal muscle) and showed that it is located 3.6 kb upstream of the
alpha cardiac myosin gene. By studies in somatic cell hybrids, they
showed, furthermore, that the beta and alpha cardiac myosin heavy chain
genes are located on chromosome 14. No suggestion of hybridization with
human chromosome 17 was detected, contrary to earlier findings (Rappold
and Vosberg, 1983). Thus, just as the human skeletal and cardiac
alpha-actin genes are located on separate chromosomes (15 and 1,
respectively), the myosin genes are on separate chromosomes. As with the
beta-myosin heavy chain genes, the cardiac actin gene is coexpressed in
adult skeletal muscle. Matsuoka et al. (1988) showed that the MYHCA
locus is on chromosome 14 by Southern analysis of human genomic DNA from
human-Chinese hamster and human-mouse somatic cell hybrids.

Matsuoka et al. (1989) regionalized the assignments of MYH6 and MYH7 to
14q11.2-q13 by hybridization of probes to DNA from cell lines with
deletions or duplications in chromosome 14 and by in situ hybridization.
In the mouse, cardiac and skeletal myosin heavy chain genes are
syntenic; this is not the case in man. The latter genes are located on
human chromosome 17.

Yamauchi-Takihara et al. (1989) showed that the MYHCA and MYHCB genes
are tandemly linked in a total length of 51 kb. The MYHCB gene, which is
predominantly expressed in ventricle and in slow-twitch skeletal muscle,
is located 4.5 kb upstream from the MYHCA gene, which is predominantly
expressed in human atrium.

Geisterfer-Lowrance et al. (1990) diagrammed the head-to-tail
orientation of the alpha and beta cardiac myosin heavy chain genes
showing the beta gene located 5-prime to the alpha gene.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Nadal-Ginard and Mahdavi (1989) reviewed the molecular biology of the
cardiac contractile apparatus and emphasized the plasticity in terms of
isoform switches in response to physiologic and pathologic stimuli.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Familial Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy 14

In a 75-year-old woman with late-onset hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
(CMH14; 613251), Niimura et al. (2002) identified a heterozygous
mutation in the MYH6 gene (R795Q; 160710.0002).

Carniel et al. (2005) analyzed the MYH6 gene in 21 families with
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (CMH) and identified heterozygous missense
mutations in 1 CMH14 proband (160710.0004). The mutation was located at
a highly conserved residue in the rod domain and was predicted to change
the structure of MYHCA.

- Dilated Cardiomyopathy 1EE

Carniel et al. (2005) analyzed the MYH6 gene in 69 families with dilated
cardiomyopathy (CMD) and identified heterozygosity for 3 different
missense mutations in 3 CMD1EE (613252) probands
(160710.0005-160710.0007). All of the mutations were located at highly
conserved residues, were predicted to change the structure or chemical
bonds of MYHCA, and were absent in at least 300 control chromosomes from
an ethnically similar population.

- Atrial Septal Defect 3

In all affected members of a 4-generation family with atrial septal
defect (ASD3; 614089), Ching et al. (2005) found heterozygosity for an
ile820-to-asn mutation (I820N; 160710.0003).

- Sick Sinus Syndrome Susceptibility

Through complementary application of SNP genotyping, whole genome
sequencing, and imputation in 38,384 Icelanders, Holm et al. (2011)
identified MYH6 as a susceptibility gene for sick sinus syndrome (SSS3;
614090). A missense variant in this gene (160710.0008), arg721 to trp,
has an allelic frequency of 0.38% in Icelanders and associates with sick
sinus syndrome with an odds ratio of 12.53 and P = 1.5 x 10(-29). Holm
et al. (2011) showed that the lifetime risk of being diagnosed with sick
sinus syndrome is around 6% for noncarriers of this variant but is
approximately 50% for carriers of the variant.

MYOSIN, CARDIAC, HEAVY CHAIN VARIANT
MYH6, MYH6/MYH7 HYBRID

In a family that showed linkage of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
(192600) to markers in the region of the cardiac MYHC genes, Solomon et
al. (1990) identified a novel restriction fragment in the cardiac MYHC
genes of all affected members. Tanigawa et al. (1990) demonstrated that
this novel fragment resulted from a Lepore-like alpha/beta cardiac MYHC
hybrid gene. Since the mutation affected polypeptides critical to
myofibril structure, the mutation was considered to be responsible for
the disorder. They suggested that nonhomologous pairing of the alpha and
beta cardiac myosin heavy chain genes and an unequal crossover event in
or near exon 27 resulted in a hybrid gene as well as complete alpha and
beta genes on the same chromosome. Thus the change is more comparable to
hemoglobin P(Congo), in which a hybrid beta/delta gene is flanked by
complete delta and beta hemoglobin genes (see 141900.0214), than to
hemoglobin Lepore, which produces a delta/beta hemoglobin hybrid gene
with deletion of both the delta and beta genes. Seidman (1992) later
found that in fact this family had a missense mutation in exon 14 of the
MYH7 gene (160760) which was probably the cause of the cardiomyopathy
because all other affected families have had missense mutations and the
family reported by Teare (1958) had the same missense mutation but
lacked the fusion gene. The fusion gene has the promoter of the alpha
(MYH6) gene and might not be expected to be expressed in the ventricle.

CARDIOMYOPATHY, FAMILIAL HYPERTROPHIC, 14
MYH6, ARG795GLN

In a 75-year-old woman with late-onset hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
(CMH14; 613251), Niimura et al. (2002) identified a heterozygous 2384G-A
transition in exon 20 of the MYH6 gene, predicted to result in an
arg795-to-glu (R795Q) substitution at a conserved residue within a
conserved protein-binding motif through which the myosin heavy chain
interacts with essential light chains. Niimura et al. (2002) suggested
that substitution of a hydrophilic glutamine residue at this site could
exert its effect by interfering with light chain interaction. The
mutation was not found in more than 170 unrelated controls.

.0003
ATRIAL SEPTAL DEFECT 3
MYH6, ILE820ASN

In all affected members, all obligate carriers, and in 1 other
individual from a large family with dominantly inherited atrial septal
defect (ASD3; 614089) and no other cardiac abnormalities, Ching et al.
(2005) identified a 1849T-A transversion in exon 21 of the MYH6 gene,
resulting in an ile820-to-asn (I820N) substitution in the neck region of
the protein. This substitution places a polar side chain into an apolar
environment, which suggests that the mutant complex is destabilized
relative to the wildtype complex. Amino acid 820 was found to be
conserved in type II myosins across all species examined; a hydrophilic
amino acid at the site corresponding to the mutant residue had not
previously been identified. The mutation was not identified in
unaffected family members or in 200 chromosomes screened from healthy
unrelated individuals.

.0004
CARDIOMYOPATHY, FAMILIAL HYPERTROPHIC, 14
MYH6, GLN1065HIS

In a Caucasian proband with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (CMH14; 613251),
who was diagnosed at 27 years of age and died from congestive heart
failure at 45 years of age, Carniel et al. (2005) identified a
heterozygous 3195G-C transversion in exon 24 of the MYH6 gene, resulting
in a gln1065-to-his (Q1065H) substitution at a highly conserved residue
of the rod domain. The mutation was not found in 2 unaffected offspring
or 150 ethnically similar controls. Family history was significant for
sudden death at age 47 years of the proband's affected mother.

.0005
CARDIOMYOPATHY, DILATED, 1EE
MYH6, PRO830LEU

In a 75-year-old Caucasian proband with dilated cardiomyopathy (CMD1EE;
613252), Carniel et al. (2005) identified a heterozygous 2489C-T
transition in exon 21 of the MYH6 gene, resulting in a pro830-to-leu
(P830L) substitution at a highly conserved residue in the globular head
of MYHCA, predicted to alter the secondary structure of the light-chain
binding domain. The patient was diagnosed at 56 years of age, and had
developed congestive heart failure by 75 years of age. The mutation was
not found in 150 ethnically similar controls.

.0006
CARDIOMYOPATHY, DILATED, 1EE
MYH6, ALA1004SER

In a 59-year-old Caucasian proband with dilated cardiomyopathy (CMD1EE;
613252), Carniel et al. (2005) identified a heterozygous 3010G-T
transversion in exon 23 of the MYH6 gene, resulting in an ala1004-to-ser
(A1004S) substitution that alters polarity in a highly conserved region
of the rod domain. The mutation was not found in 150 ethnically similar
controls. The patient was diagnosed at 51 years of age, and developed
congestive heart failure by 59 years of age.

.0007
CARDIOMYOPATHY, DILATED, 1EE
MYH6, GLU1457LYS

In a 57-year-old Caucasian proband with dilated cardiomyopathy (CMD1EE;
613252), Carniel et al. (2005) identified a heterozygous 4369G-A
transition in exon 31 of the MYH6 gene, resulting in a glu1457-to-lys
(E1457K) substitution at a highly conserved residue. This change was
predicted to alter the alpha-helix of the rod domain, changing the
conformation of a 4-amino acid region from an organized alpha-helix to a
random-coil pattern. The mutation was not found in an unaffected
relative or in 150 ethnically similar controls. The patient was
diagnosed at 44 years of age, and had undergone heart transplantation by
57 years of age.

.0008
SICK SINUS SYNDROME 3, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
MYH6, ARG721TRP

In a study comprised of 38,384 Icelanders using complementary
application of SNP genotyping, whole-genome sequencing, and imputation,
Holm et al. (2011) identified a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 2161
(2161C-T) in exon 18 of the MYH6 gene, resulting in an
arginine-to-tryptophan substitution at codon 721 (R721W), as a mutation
predisposing to sick sinus syndrome (SSS3; 614090) (odds ratio = 12.53,
95% CI, 8.08-19.44, P = 1.5 x 10(-29)). The 2161C-T mutation was
predicted to alter the structure of the converter domain of alpha-MHC,
which plays a critical role in amplifying the structural rearrangements
in the motor domain and transmitting them to the alpha-helical tail
during movements of the myosin during contraction. Among Icelanders, the
allelic frequency of this variant is 0.38%. Holm et al. (2011) showed
that while the lifetime risk of being diagnosed with sick sinus syndrome
is approximately 6% for noncarriers, the risk for carriers of being
diagnosed is approximately 50%. There was also a significant association
(P = 3.6 x 10(-25), OR = 10.17, 95% CI, 6.56-15.77) between the 2161C-T
variant and the necessity for pacemaker implantation. There was a
residual association, after exclusion of sick sinus syndrome cases, with
several diseases, including atrial fibrillation and thoracic aortic
aneurysm.

611856	TITLE *611856 MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN L52; MRPL52
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mitochondria have their own translation system for production of 13
inner membrane proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation. MRPL52
is a component of the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome that
is encoded by the nuclear genome (Koc et al., 2001).

CLONING

By searching databases using bovine Mrpl52 as query, Koc et al. (2001)
identified human MRPL52. They also identified MRPL52 homologs in mouse,
Drosophila, and C. elegans, but not in yeast, E. coli, or Arabidopsis.
Mouse and human MRPL52 share 85.1% amino acid identity.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the MRPL52
gene to chromosome 14 (TMAP RH103319).

605918	TITLE *605918 SPONDIN 2; SPON2
;;MINDIN;;
M-SPONDIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a differential display technique, Manda et al. (1999) isolated 2
novel cDNAs, SPON2 and C20ORF1 (605917), which they designated
differentially expressed in cancerous and noncancerous lung cells-1
(DIL1) and -2 (DIL2), respectively. The full-length SPON2 cDNA encodes a
331-amino acid protein with a domain organization similar to those of
zebrafish mindin-1/mindin-2 and F-spondin (SPON1; 604989): a hydrophobic
signal sequence in the N terminus, an FS1 domain, an FS2 domain, and a
thrombospondin type I repeat. RT-PCR analysis detected no expression of
SPON2 in lung carcinoma cells. Northern blot analysis detected
expression of a 1.9-kb SPON2 transcript in various tissues, including
adult and fetal lung.

He et al. (2004) cloned mouse Spon2, which they termed mindin. The mouse
mindin protein, which is 85% identical to the human protein, is a
conserved member of a family of secreted extracellular matrix proteins.
RNA blot analysis detected expression in a variety of tissues, with
abundant expression in lung and lymphoid tissues. Immunoblot blot
analysis showed expression of a 42-kD protein under reducing conditions
and expression of dimers and oligomers in a concentration-dependent
manner under nonreducing conditions.

GENE STRUCTURE

He et al. (2004) determined that the mouse Spon2 gene contains 6 exons
spanning 5 kb.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SPON2
gene to chromosome 4p16.3 (TMAP WI-22263).

ANIMAL MODEL

By targeted replacement of part of exon 1 and all of exons 2 and 3 of
the Spon2 gene, He et al. (2004) generated Spon2-deficient mice. These
mice had a normal appearance and life span under pathogen-free
conditions. Spon2-deficient mice were resistant to lipopolysaccharide
(LPS)-induced shock, and their macrophages only produced slightly
elevated inflammatory cytokines. Addition of Spon2 to Spon2-deficient,
but not Tlr4 (603030)-deficient, macrophages restored their ability to
produce inflammatory cytokines in response to LPS. Stimuli from most
gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and yeast also failed to induce
cytokine responses from Spon2-deficient macrophages and mast cells.
Spon2-deficient mice showed variable clearance of pathogens when
inoculated by the pulmonary and intraperitoneal routes. Fluorescence
microscopy demonstrated Spon2-dependent bacterial agglutination in the
presence of calcium due to a specific interaction with the carbohydrate
moiety of LPS and lipoteichoic acid. Phagocytosis experiments indicated
that Spon2 acts as an opsonin and pattern-recognition molecule for a
range of pathogens. He et al. (2004) proposed that Spon2 recognition of
carbohydrate structures is essential for the activation of macrophages
by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs).

602198	TITLE *602198 CDK2-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1; CDK2AP1
;;DELETED IN ORAL CANCER 1; DOC1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Todd et al. (1995) isolated an evolutionarily conserved gene that
exhibits frequent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and significant reduction
in expression in malignant oral keratinocytes of the hamster
(Mesocricetus auratus). They symbolized the gene doc-1 for 'deleted in
oral cancer.' Transfection of normal doc-1 cDNA into malignant oral
keratinocytes reversed the transformed phenotype in the hamster model.

Daigo et al. (1997) isolated a human cDNA encoding a 115-amino acid
polypeptide that shows 97% identity to the doc-1 gene of the hamster. It
also shows a high degree of homology to a gene induced by TNF-alpha
(191160) in the mouse.

GENE FUNCTION

To investigate the possible role of DOC1 in esophageal carcinogenesis,
Daigo et al. (1997) examined genetic alterations in expression levels of
the gene in 13 esophageal carcinoma cell lines and 10 primary esophageal
carcinomas. No mutation or reduction of expression was observed in any
of the 23 cancer materials examined.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Daigo et al. (1997) mapped the
human DOC1 gene to chromosome 12q24.31.

604477	TITLE *604477 CHROMOBOX HOMOLOG 3; CBX3
;;HP1, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, GAMMA;;
HP1-GAMMA
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

At the nuclear envelope in higher eukaryotic cells, the nuclear lamina
and the heterochromatin are adjacent to the inner nuclear membrane.
Using the nucleoplasmic N terminus of lamin B receptor (LBR; 600024), an
integral protein of the inner nuclear membrane, as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Ye and Worman (1996) showed
that LBR binds to 2 chromodomain proteins that are homologs of
Drosophila HP1. One of these proteins, CBX3, contains 173 amino acids
and shows 65% sequence similarity with the other protein, CBX5 (604478).

GENE FUNCTION

Ye and Worman (1996) found that LBR fusion proteins bound to CBX
proteins synthesized by in vitro translation and present in cell
lysates. LBR also coimmunoprecipitated the CBX proteins from cell
extracts. Ye and Worman (1996) suggested that the interaction between
LBR and the chromodomain proteins may explain, in part, the association
of heterochromatin with the inner nuclear membrane.

Following overexpression of MIS12 (609178) in HeLa cells, Obuse et al.
(2004) immunoprecipitated several proteins, including HP1-gamma, that
interacted with MIS12 in a kinetochore-associated complex. Both
HP1-alpha (CBX5) and HP1-gamma interacted directly with MIS12 and
C20ORF172 (609175). Using HP1 RNA interference (RNAi), Obuse et al.
(2004) found that HP1-alpha and HP1-gamma were functionally redundant.
In double HP1 RNAi, the integrity of kinetochores was abolished and
micronuclei were formed. Obuse et al. (2004) hypothesized that the firm
association of heterochromatic HP1 with the MIS12 complex may be a
fundamental feature of human kinetochore formation.

Fischle et al. (2005) demonstrated that HP1-alpha (604478), HP1-beta
(604511), and HP1-gamma are released from chromatin during the M phase
of the cell cycle even though trimethylation levels of histone H3 (see
602810) lys9 remain unchanged. However, the additional transient
modification of histone H3 by phosphorylation of ser10 next to the more
stable methyl-lys9 mark is sufficient to eject HP1 proteins from their
binding sites. Inhibition or depletion of the mitotic kinase Aurora B
(604970), which phosphorylates histone H3 on ser10, causes retention of
HP1 proteins on mitotic chromosomes, suggesting that H3 ser10
phosphorylation is necessary for the dissociation of HP1 from chromatin
in M phase. Fischle et al. (2005) concluded that their findings
establish a regulatory mechanism of protein-protein interactions,
through a combinatorial readout of 2 adjacent posttranslational
modifications: a stable methylation and a dynamic phosphorylation mark.

Smallwood et al. (2007) demonstrated that DNMT1 (126375) could interact
with HP1-alpha, HP1-beta, and HP1-gamma in a human colon carcinoma cell
line, resulting in stimulation of DNMT1 methyltransferase activity. The
HP1 proteins were sufficient to target DNMT1 activity in vivo, and
HP1-dependent repression required DNMT1. Smallwood et al. (2007)
demonstrated that HP1-alpha and HP1-beta were recruited to the survivin
(BIRC5; 603352) promoter in a DNMT1-dependent manner, whereas HP1-gamma
was present when the survivin gene was active. They concluded that
direct interactions between HP1 proteins and DNMT1 mediate silencing of
euchromatic genes.

300883	TITLE *300883 SORTING NEXIN 12; SNX12
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SNX12 belongs to a large family of proteins characterized by the
presence of an SNX-type phox (see 608512) homology (PX) domain with
conserved arg-arg-tyr-X-asp/glu and pro-pro-X-pro-X-lys motifs. SNX
family members are predicted to be involved in the sorting of endosomes
(Teasdale et al., 2001).

CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to yeast Snx1 (601272),
Teasdale et al. (2001) identified human SNX12. The deduced protein has a
central 146-amino acid SNX-PH domain, but it lacks C-terminal
coiled-coil motifs found in several other SNX family members.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the SNX12 gene to chromosome Xq13.1 based on an
alignment of the SNX12 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF171229) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;KIAA1582
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a fetal brain cDNA library, Nagase et
al. (2000) cloned TNRC6C, which they designated KIAA1582. The deduced
1,448-amino acid protein contains an RNA recognition motif and a
ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain. RT-PCR ELISA detected moderate
expression in heart, kidney, testis, ovary, adult and fetal brain, and
all specific adult brain regions examined. Low expression was detected
in skeletal muscle, and no expression was detected in lung, liver,
pancreas, spleen, and fetal liver.

Schneider et al. (2006) stated that the TNRC6C protein contains a
glycine/tryptophan (GW)-rich N-terminal domain, followed by a UBA
domain, a glutamine-rich region, and a C-terminal RNA recognition motif.

MAPPING

By PCR of a human-rodent hybrid panel, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the
TNRC6C gene to chromosome 17.

600075	TITLE *600075 TATA BOX-BINDING PROTEIN; TBP
;;SCA17 GENE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The RNA polymerase II transcription factor D (TFIID; see 313650) is a
multisubunit complex essential for the expression of most, if not all,
protein-encoding genes. The DNA-binding subunit of TFIID is the TATA
box-binding protein (TBP).

GENE FUNCTION

The TBP C-terminal domain of 180 amino acids is well conserved, and this
domain is both necessary and sufficient for interaction with DNA and for
assembly of the basal transcription apparatus (Peterson et al., 1990).
Contrary to the previously hypothesized existence of a family of genes
coding for DNA-binding proteins highly related to TBP, Purrello et al.
(1994) showed that the segment coding for the evolutionarily conserved
C-terminal DNA-binding domain is unique. When bound to the TATA box, it
has a saddle-like shape, with the concave face contacting DNA and the
convex interacting with the other subunits of TFIID, which are called
TBP-associated factors (TAFs; see 600475), with TFIIA (600519, 600520)
and TFIIB (189963), with the A form of RNA polymerase II CTD, and with
positive and negative modulators of basal and activated transcription of
class II genes (reviewed by Nikolov et al., 1992). The N terminus of TBP
modulates the DNA-binding activity of the C terminus of the protein. It
contains a long string of glutamine codons, which represents a common
motif among other proteins involved in transcription, such as SP1
(189906) and some homeobox proteins (Purrello et al., 1994).

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Juo et al. (2003) reported a 2.95-angstrom resolution crystal structure
of the ternary complex containing BRF1 (604902) homology domain II, the
conserved region of TBP, and 19 basepairs of U6 (180692) promoter DNA.
The structure revealed the core interface for assembly of transcription
factor IIIB and demonstrated how the loosely packed BRF1 domain achieves
remarkable binding specificity with the convex and lateral surfaces of
TBP.

MAPPING

Using a somatic cell hybrid panel, Polymeropoulos et al. (1991)
tentatively assigned the TBP gene to chromosome 6. By multipoint linkage
analysis in CEPH families, Imbert et al. (1994) mapped the TBP gene to
6q27 by linkage to DNA markers. Saito et al. (1994) demonstrated a
polymorphic (CAG)n repeat in the N-terminal region of the TBP gene. They
reported the localization of the gene to 6q27.05-qter by fluorescence in
situ hybridization, using the cDNA clone with or without the (CAG)n
repeat as a probe. Using a 3-prime C-terminal domain cDNA probe,
Purrello et al. (1994) performed in situ hybridization to localize the
TBP locus at 6q27. Segregation analysis with the same probe in a large
series of mouse/human somatic cell hybrids confirmed that the TBP locus
is a single copy and is localized at chromosome 6q21-ter. Rosen et al.
(1995) used oligonucleotide primers flanking a polymorphic stretch of 38
glutamine codons in the 5-prime coding region of the TBP gene to map the
TBP gene to 6qter.

Trachtulec and Forejt (2001) reported that in human, mouse, and snake,
the PDCD2 (600866) and TBP genes are adjacent tail to tail. These 2
genes are linked also in Drosophila and are likewise syntenic in C.
elegans and S. pombe.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

TBP is an important general transcription initiation factor (Kao et al.,
1990; Peterson et al., 1990; Gostout et al., 1993). It contains a long
polymorphic imperfect CAG repeat corresponding to the polyglutamine
region. In a large population study, alleles corresponding to a range of
25 to 42 glutamine residues were detected, with the most common alleles
encoding stretches of 32 to 39 glutamines. A gln42 allele was found only
once in 2,003 chromosomes (Gostout et al., 1993).

Imbert et al. (1994) raised the question of a possible role of an
expanded CAG repeat region of the TBP gene in some late-onset neurologic
disorders.

Several genes for transcription factors, such as TBP and POU-domain
transcription factor (POU1F1; 173110), contain CAG trinucleotide repeats
encoding polyglutamine structures. CAG repeat expansion is known to be
the basis of at least 8 hereditary neurodegenerative disorders,
including Huntington disease (143100), spinocerebellar ataxia-1
(164400), and Machado-Joseph disease (109150). Since the TBP gene
contains particularly long and polymorphic CAG repeats, ranging from 25
to 42, the TBP gene was investigated intensively as a candidate for
psychiatric disorders (Imbert et al., 1994; Rubinsztein et al., 1996;
Jones et al., 1997), but no expansion of the CAG repeat was identified.

- Spinocerebellar Ataxia 17

In a 14-year-old Japanese girl with spinocerebellar ataxia 17 (SCA17;
607136), Koide et al. (1999) identified a de novo expansion of the CAG
repeat of the TBP gene (600075.0001). The mutated TBP, which had an
expanded polyglutamine stretch of 63 glutamines, was expressed in
lymphoblastoid cell lines at a level comparable with that of wildtype
TBP. The CAG repeat of the TBP gene consisted of impure CAG repeat, and
the de novo expansion involved partial duplication of the CAG repeat.
The patient was noted at age 6 to have gait disturbance and intellectual
deterioration. By age 9, she showed truncal ataxia, spasticity, and
muscle weakness. She was confined to a wheelchair at age 13. The
mutation had occurred on the chromosome inherited from her father. She
was identified from a larger group of 118 patients with various forms of
neurologic disease.

Zuhlke et al. (2001) confirmed the report of a polyglutamine disease due
to (CAG)n repeat expansion in the TBP gene. They investigated 604
patients (469 sporadic and 135 familial cases) with ataxia and gait
disturbances in whom repeat expansions of previously identified genes
had been excluded and found repeat expansion in the TBP gene in 2
families of northern German origin with autosomal dominant inheritance
of ataxia, dystonia, and intellectual decline. A marked intra- and
interfamilial phenotypic variability was observed. Elongated
polyglutamine stretches between 50 and 55 residues were demonstrated,
whereas 15 different normal alleles contained 27 to a maximum of 44
triplets.

In patients with a Huntington disease-like phenotype (HDL4; 607136),
Stevanin et al. (2003), Bauer et al. (2004), and Toyoshima et al. (2004)
identified repeat expansions in the TBP gene.

Shatunov et al. (2004) described a 20-year-old North American patient
who developed rapidly progressive cognitive decline and pronounced
ataxia who had a 129M/M PRNP genotype (176640.0005) and was originally
thought to have variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (vCJD; see 123400).
Further studies, however, showed that the patient had an expanded allele
with 55 CAG/CAA repeats in the TBP gene. The patient's unaffected
parents and sibs showed normal-sized TBP alleles with 37 to 38 repeats.
Haplotype and nucleotide sequence analyses indicated that the mutation
had occurred de novo on a chromosome inherited from the father. Shatunov
et al. (2004) suggested that variant CJD should be added to the list of
disorders tested for the TBP trinucleotide expansion.

Tomiuk et al. (2007) analyzed the microsatellite region of the TBP gene
in 10 unrelated German SCA17 patients, 30 unaffected members of 10 SCA17
families, 15 controls, and 10 previously published SCA17 families, as
well as the homologous regions in 10 primate species. They showed that
the characteristic CAA-CAG-CAA interruption pattern was conserved and
likely to result from selection for stabilizing the microsatellite.
Comparison of the microsatellite region across primate species showed
that SCA17 is likely to be a human trait, with the most common 37-repeat
allele acting as a repository for expanded, pathogenic alleles. Tomiuk
et al. (2007) concluded that the cassette-like structure of 5 out of 17
expanded alleles can be attributed to unequal crossing over, thus
explaining the rare and sporadic de novo generation of SCA17 alleles.

Gao et al. (2008) used small pool PCR to compared somatic instability of
expanded CAG repeats in 1 Mexican, 4 Japanese, and 2 German SCA17
families. CAG repeats had 2 distinct configurations: complex or group I
consisting of (CAG)3 (CAA)3 (CAG)n1 CAA-CAG-CAA (CAG)n2 CAA-CAG ('n1'
from 7 to 11 and 'n2' from 9 to 21) and simple or group II consisting of
(CAG)3 (CAA)3 (CAG)n1 CAA-CAG ('n1' from 42 to 47). Both CAG and CAA in
these repeat tracts code for glutamine. Group I mutations were prone to
contraction, whereas group II mutations were prone to continuing
expansion. Analysis of individual alleles showed a correlation between
mutation frequency and the number of CAG/CAA repeats (0.76), but the
difference between the 2 groups was no significant. However, there was a
strong correlation between the configuration of the CAG/CAA repeat and
instability: those with more CAA interruptions showed more stability,
whereas those with less or no CAA interruptions showed more instability.
These changes also correlated with intergenerational instability and
anticipation in regard to age at onset. Of note, the pure CAG repeats
showed both expansion and contraction, while the interrupted repeats
exhibited mostly contraction at a significantly lower frequency. Gao et
al. (2008) suggested that repeat configuration is a critical determinant
for instability, and that CAA interruptions (i.e., CAA-CAG-CAA or domain
3) might serve as a limiting element for further expansion of CAG
repeats at the SCA17 locus.

- Susceptibility to Parkinson Disease

In a patient with Parkinson disease (168600) from Taiwan, Wu et al.
(2004) detected an abnormal trinucleotide repeat expansion (46 repeats)
in the SCA17 gene. The patient presented with typical features of
idiopathic PD: late onset of disease, resting tremor in the limbs,
rigidity, bradykinesia, and a good response to levodopa. The authors
noted that this was the first report describing PD in association with
an expanded allele in the TBP gene.

ANIMAL MODEL

Veenstra et al. (2000) tested the role of Tbp during the onset of
embryonic transcription in Xenopus by antisense oligonucleotide-mediated
turnover of maternal Tbp mRNA. Embryos without detectable Tbp initiated
gastrulation but died before completing gastrulation. The expression of
many genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II and III was reduced;
however, some genes were transcribed with an efficiency identical to
that of Tbp-containing embryos. Using a similar antisense strategy,
Veenstra et al. (2000) found that the TBP-like factor Tlf/Trf2 (TBPL1;
605521) was essential for development past the midblastula stage.
Because TBP and a TLF factor were found to play complementary roles in
embryonic development, Veenstra et al. (2000) concluded that their
results indicate that although similar mechanistic roles exist in
common, TBP and TLF function differentially to control transcription of
specific genes.

Mammalian TBP consists of a 180-amino acid core that is common to all
eukaryotes fused to a vertebrate-specific N-terminal domain. Hobbs et
al. (2002) generated mice with a modified Tbp allele, designated Tbp
delta-N, that produced a version of Tbp lacking 111 of the 135
vertebrate-specific amino acids. More than 90% of Tbp delta-N/delta-N
fetuses died in midgestation from an apparent defect in the placenta.
Tbp delta-N/delta-N fetuses could be rescued by supplying them with a
wildtype tetraploid placenta. Mutants also could be rescued by rearing
them in immunocompromised mothers. In immune-competent mothers, survival
of Tbp delta-N/delta-N fetuses increased when fetal/placental
beta-2-microglobulin (B2M; 109700) expression was genetically disrupted.
These results suggested that the TBP N terminus functions in
transcriptional regulation of a placental B2M-dependent process that
favors maternal immunotolerance of pregnancy.

Martianov et al. (2002) inactivated the murine Tbp gene by targeted
disruption. Tbp +/- mice were born in the expected mendelian frequency
and were of normal size and weight, displayed no obvious abnormalities,
and were fertile. Crossing TBP heterozygote mice failed to generate
viable newborn homozygous mutant mice. However, at 3.5 days postcoitum
(E3.5), an approximately mendelian ratio of Tbp -/- mice could be
detected with PCR. When examined by immunofluorescence for expression of
the Tbp protein, blastocysts were detected that were totally negative
for Tbp labeling. TBP was absent in explanted blastocysts grown for 1
day in vitro. Strongly reduced Tbp levels were also detected at E2.5 in
8 cell-stage embryos, which indicates that the maternal Tbp pool was
significantly depleted at this stage and was undetectable by the
blastocyst stage. Blastocysts from Tbp heterozygote crosses were
explanted at E3.5 and cultivated in vitro. Approximately 25% of the
blastocysts rapidly ceased growth and died, whereas the others hatched
from the zona pellucida and continued to develop. After 2 days,
extensive apoptosis was observed in the growth-arrested Tbp homozygous
mutant embryos. Embryos staining negatively for Tbp were also recovered
at E4.5. These embryos typically comprised 30 to 40 cells, fewer than
normally seen in wildtype E3.5 blastocysts, indicating that growth
arrest occurred before E3.5, just as Tbp levels became undetectable.
Martianov et al. (2002) found that after loss of Tbp, RNA polymerase II
(pol II; see 180660) remained in a transcriptionally active
phosphorylation state, and in situ run-off experiments showed high
levels of pol II transcription compared to those of wildtype cells. In
contrast, pol I and pol III transcription was arrested. Martianov et al.
(2002) concluded that their results show a differential dependency of
the RNA polymerases on TBP and provide evidence for TBP-independent pol
II transcriptional mechanisms that allow reinitiation and maintenance of
gene transcription in vivo.

Shah et al. (2009) characterized cellular and mouse models expressing
polyQ-expanded TBP. The rat PC12 cellular model exhibited characteristic
features of neuronal dysfunction, including decreased cell viability and
defective neurite outgrowth. The high-affinity nerve growth factor
receptor, Trka (NTRK1; 191315), was downregulated by mutant TBP in PC12
cells. Downregulation of Trka also occurred in the cerebellum of SCA17
transgenic mice prior to Purkinje cell degeneration. Mutant TBP bound
more Sp1 (189906), reduced its occupancy of the Trka promoter and
inhibited the activity of the Trka promoter. Shah et al. (2009)
suggested that the transcriptional downregulation of TRKA by mutant TBP
may contribute to SCA17 pathogenesis.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA 17
PARKINSON DISEASE, LATE-ONSET, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, INCLUDED
TBP, (CAG)n EXPANSION

Koide et al. (1999) described a sporadic case of a complex neurologic
disorder with cerebellar ataxia, pyramidal signs, and severe
intellectual impairment (SCA17; 607136) associated with expansion of the
CAG repeat of the TBP gene. The gene encoded 63 glutamines, far
exceeding the range in normal individuals (25 to 42 in Caucasians; 31 to
42 in Japanese).

Zuhlke et al. (2001) described 2 German families with an autosomal
dominant degenerative multisystem disorder with predominant ataxia and
intellectual impairment but also involvement of the pyramidal,
extrapyramidal, and possibly autonomic system (607136). Expanded (CAG)n
alleles of the TBP gene ranged between 50 and 55 residues in affected
individuals. In 1 family, 2 affected sisters differed by 1 trinucleotide
repeat, and upon transmission from one of the sisters to her daughter
the repeat was elongated by 2 units. This expansion may have contributed
to the earlier age of onset in the daughter. In the other family, the
(CAG)n element was combined with CAA interruptions, which had not been
described for CAG expansions in other genes.

Nakamura et al. (2001) identified a form of spinocerebellar ataxia- 17
in 4 Japanese pedigrees which was caused by an abnormal (CAG)n expansion
in TBP to a range of 47 to 55 repeats. Age at onset ranged from 19 to 48
years, and symptoms included ataxia, bradykinesia, and dementia.
Postmortem brain tissue from 1 patient exhibited shrinkage and moderate
loss of small neurons with gliosis predominantly in the caudate nucleus
and putamen, with similar but moderate changes in the thalamus, frontal
cortex, and temporal cortex. Moderate Purkinje cell loss and an increase
of Bergmann glia were seen in the cerebellum. Immunocytochemical
analysis performed with anti-ubiquitin (191339) and anti-TBP antibodies
showed neuronal intranuclear inclusion bodies, and most neuronal nuclei
were diffusely stained with 1C2 antibody, which recognizes expanded
polyglutamine tracts.

In a total of 12 patients with a Huntington disease-like phenotype
(607136), Stevanin et al. (2003), Bauer et al. (2004), and Toyoshima et
al. (2004) identified expanded trinucleotide repeats, ranging from 44 to
52 repeats, in the TBP gene. Clinical features were indistinguishable
from Huntington disease, including behavioral changes progressing to
dementia, chorea, cerebellar gait, lower limb hyperreflexia, and
pontocerebellar atrophy.

Shatunov et al. (2004) described a 20-year-old patient who developed
rapidly progressive cognitive decline and pronounced ataxia, a phenotype
compatible with prion disease. No mutation was found in the PRNP gene
(176640), and the patient was found to have a de novo increase of the
trinucleotide repeat number in the coding region of the TBP gene.

Susceptibility to Parkinson Disease

In a patient with Parkinson disease (168600) from Taiwan, Wu et al.
(2004) detected an abnormal trinucleotide repeat expansion (46 repeats)
in the SCA17 gene. The patient presented with typical features of
idiopathic PD: late onset of disease, resting tremor in the limbs,
rigidity, bradykinesia, and a good response to levodopa. The authors
noted that this was the first report describing PD in association with

606330	TITLE *606330 PROTOCADHERIN-BETA 4; PCDHB4
;;PCDH-BETA-4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cadherins are calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecules, and
protocadherins constitute a subfamily of nonclassic cadherins. PCDHB4 is
1 of 16 tandemly arranged genes in the PCDHB gene cluster (604967) on
chromosome 5q31. Unlike the PCDHA (see 604966) and PCDHG (see 604968)
genes, which function as 'variable' exons that are spliced to downstream
constant region exons to produce mRNAs, the PCDHB genes do not use
constant region exons to produce mRNAs. Thus, each single-exon PCDHB
gene encodes the extracellular, transmembrane, and short cytoplasmic
domains of the protein (Wu et al., 2001). For further information on the
PCDHB genes, see 604967.

CLONING

By PCR of a brain cDNA library, Wu and Maniatis (1999) cloned
full-length PCDHB4.

Wu et al. (2001) determined that human PCDHB4 is paralogous to 3 mouse
PCDHBs, Pcdhb5, Pcdhb7, and Ppcdhb9.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Wu et al. (2001) mapped the PCDHB4 gene to
chromosome 5q31. They localized the mouse PCDHB genes to chromosome 18c.

600641	TITLE *600641 SULFOTRANSFERASE FAMILY 1A, PHENOL-PREFERRING, MEMBER 3; SULT1A3
;;SULFOTRANSFERASE, MONOAMINE-PREFERRING; STM
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Sulfate conjugation is a key metabolic process controlled by a number of
genes. These include STD (125263), the dehydroepiandrosterone
(DHEA)-preferring sulfotransferase; STE (600043), the
estrogen-preferring form; STP1 (171150) and STP2 (601292), the
phenol-preferring forms; and STM, the monoamine-preferring form. STM,
the thermolabile or monoamine-metabolizing form of phenol
sulfotransferase, is responsible for the sulfate conjugation of
monoamine neurotransmitters such as dopamine, over 95% of which is
sulfate conjugated (Aksoy and Weinshilboum, 1995).

CLONING

Zhu et al. (1993) and Wood et al. (1994) cloned the STM cDNA from brain
and liver libraries, respectively. The same cDNA was later isolated by
Jones et al. (1995). The 3 sequences were in agreement and predicted a
295-amino acid protein.

Aksoy et al. (1994) expressed the STM cDNA in COS-1 cells as a 35.5-kD
protein. Northern blots showed a 1.4-kb mRNA in liver, kidney, lung,
small intestine, spleen and leukocytes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Aksoy and Weinshilboum (1995) determined that the STM gene has a total
length of approximately 8.4 kb and includes 10 exons, the first 3 of
which are untranslated. Many of the exon-intron borders are at the same
positions as in the human DHEA sulfotransferase gene. The first 2 exons
are present in the 5-prime UTR of a longer mRNA expressed in brain and
liver, while exon 3 is present in the 5-prime UTR of a shorter mRNA also
present in these tissues.

Dooley and Huang (1996) determined the genomic organization of the human
STP1, STP2, and STM genes. These 3 genes each have 8 exons with the
initiator methionine on exon 2. All 3 colocalize on a single cosmid from
chromosome 16p12.1-p11.2 and have a high degree of sequence homology,
suggesting that these 3 genes arose by gene duplication. Dooley and
Huang (1996) stated that the previously identified PST gene sequences
HAST3 and M-PST are isolates of the STM gene.

GENE FUNCTION

Weinshilboum et al. (1997) reviewed the molecular biology of the
sulfotransferases. These enzymes catalyze sulfate conjugation of many
hormones, neurotransmitters, drugs, and xenobiotic compounds. They
stated that at that time the 5 known human cytosolic sulfotransferases
were STE (symbolized EST by them), a hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase
STD, and 3 phenol-preferring sulfotransferases (STP1, STP2, and STM).
The genes for these human enzymes, as well as those of other mammalian
cytosolic sulfotransferases that had been cloned, showed a high degree
of structural homology, with conservation of location of most
intron-exon splice junctions. Genetic polymorphisms of several of these
that have been demonstrated through family studies are suspected on the
basis of large differences among individuals in the expression.

MAPPING

Aksoy et al. (1994) used PCR screening of DNAs from human-rodent somatic
cell hybrid mapping panels to assign the STM gene to chromosome 16.
Regional localization to 16p11.2 was achieved by PCR analysis of a
high-resolution mouse-human somatic cell hybrid panel containing defined
portions of human chromosome 16.

Bernier et al. (1994) assigned the placental estrogen sulfotransferase
to chromosome 16 using DNA from panels of human/rodent somatic cell
hybrids and PCR amplification. Weinshilboum (1995) pointed out that the
'placental estrogen sulfotransferase' gene that Bernier et al. (1994)
mapped to chromosome 16 is, in fact, the STM gene. Bernier et al. (1994)
reported, on the basis of expression data, that the mRNA encoded by
their gene can catalyze the sulfate conjugation of estrogens, although
with a much lower affinity than the mRNA encoded by the human STE gene
that is localized on 4q13.1 (600043).

The STM gene, a thermolabile phenol sulfotransferase, maps very near the
location of the thermostable phenol sulfotransferase, STP1. Her et al.
(1996) showed that a second thermolabile phenol sulfotransferase, STP2
(601292), also maps to chromosome 16.

604882	TITLE *604882 NEUROGENIN 3; NEUROG3
;;NGN3;;
ATOH5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Neurogenin-3 (NEUROG3) is expressed in endocrine progenitor cells and is
required for endocrine cell development in the pancreas and intestine
(Wang et al., 2006). It belongs to a family of basic helix-loop-helix
transcription factors involved in the determination of neural precursor
cells in the neuroectoderm (Gradwohl et al., 2000).

CLONING

By in situ hybridization, Sommer et al. (1996) found that mouse Ngn3 was
most strongly expressed in a restricted region of the developing spinal
cord, just dorsal to the floor plate. Expression was detectable as early
as embryonic day 9 and persisted until day 14. Ngn3 was also expressed
in the developing hypothalamic region and in pancreatic islet cell
progenitors.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sommer et al. (1996) determined that the mouse Ngn3 gene contains a
single coding exon.

GENE FUNCTION

Spence et al. (2011) established a robust and efficient process to
direct the differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into
intestinal tissue in vitro using a temporal series of growth factor
manipulations to mimic embryonic intestinal development. Using this
culture system as a model to study human intestinal development, Spence
et al. (2011) identified that the combined activity of WNT3A (606359)
and FGF4 (164980) is required for hindgut specification, whereas FGF4
alone is sufficient to promote hindgut morphogenesis. Spence et al.
(2011) also determined that NEUROG3 is both necessary and sufficient for
human enteroendocrine cell development in vitro. Spence et al. (2011)
concluded that human intestinal stem cells form de novo during
development.

Talchai et al. (2012) showed that, unexpectedly, somatic ablation of
Foxo1 (136533) in Neurog3+ enteroendocrine progenitor cells gives rise
to gut insulin-positive cells that express markers of mature beta cells
and secrete bioactive insulin as well as C peptide in response to
glucose and sulfonylureas. Lineage tracing experiments showed that gut
insulin-positive cells arise cell autonomously from Foxo1-deficient
cells. Inducible Fox1 ablation in adult mice also resulted in the
generation of gut insulin-positive cells. Following ablation by the
beta-cell toxin streptozotocin, gut insulin-positive cells regenerated
and produced insulin, reversing hyperglycemia in mice. Talchai et al.
(2012) concluded that their data indicated that Neurog3+ enteroendocrine
progenitors require active Foxo1 to prevent differentiation into
insulin-positive cells, and suggested that Foxo1 ablation in gut
epithelium may provide an approach to restore insulin production in type
1 diabetes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Kim et al. (2001) concluded that genetic variability in neurogenin-3
gene does not contribute to the etiology of maturity-onset diabetes of
the young (see 125853) or other forms of autosomal dominant diabetes.

In 3 unrelated boys with congenital malabsorptive diarrhea (DIAR4;
610370), Wang et al. (2006) identified 2 different homozygous mutations
in the NEUROG3 gene (604882.0001; 604882.0002). Both mutations rendered
the NEUROG3 protein unable to activate NEUROD1 (601724), a downstream
target of NEUROG3, and compromised the ability of NEUROG3 to bind to an
E-box element in the NEUROD1 promoter. The injection of wildtype but not
mutant NEUROG3 mRNA into Xenopus embryos induced NEUROD1 expression. The
authors referred to the disorder in these boys as 'enteric
anendocrinosis.'

ANIMAL MODEL

Mouse Ngn3 is expressed in discrete regions of the nervous system and in
scattered cells in the embryonic pancreas (Sommer et al., 1996).
Gradwohl et al. (2000) showed that Ngn3-positive cells did not express
insulin or glucagon, suggesting that Ngn3 marks early precursors of
pancreatic endocrine cells. Mice lacking Ngn3 function failed to
generate any pancreatic endocrine cells and died postnatally from
diabetes. Expression of the pancreatic transcription factors Isl1
(600366), Pax4 (167413), Pax6 (607108), and NeuroD (601724) was lost,
and endocrine precursors were lacking in the mutant pancreatic
epithelium. Thus, Ngn3 was required for the specification of a common
precursor of the 4 pancreatic endocrine cell types.

Lee et al. (2002) found that glucagon-secreting A cells,
somatostatin-secreting D cells, and gastrin-secreting G cells were
absent from the epithelium of the glandular stomach of Ngn3 -/- mice,
and the number of serotonin-expressing enterochromaffin cells was
dramatically decreased. In addition, Ngn3 -/- mice displayed intestinal
metaplasia of the gastric epithelium. Lee et al. (2002) concluded that
NGN3 is required for differentiation of enteroendocrine cells in the
stomach and maintenance of gastric epithelial cell identity.

Zhou et al. (2008) used a strategy of reexpressing key developmental
regulators in vivo to identify a specific combination of 3 transcription
factors, Neurog3, Pdx1 (600733), and Mafa (610303), that reprogrammed
differentiated pancreatic exocrine cells in adult mice into cells that
closely resembled beta cells. Induced beta cells were indistinguishable
from endogenous islet beta cells in size, shape, and ultrastructure.
They expressed genes essential for beta cell function and could
ameliorate hyperglycemia by remodeling local vasculature and secreting
insulin. Zhou et al. (2008) concluded that their study provided an
example of cellular reprogramming using defined factors in an adult
organ and suggested a general paradigm for directing cell reprogramming
without reversion to a pluripotent stem cell state.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
DIARRHEA 4, MALABSORPTIVE, CONGENITAL
NEUROG3, ARG107SER

In a patient with congenital malabsorptive diarrhea (610370), Wang et
al. (2006) identified a homozygous missense mutation in the neurogenin-3
gene, predicted to result in an arg107-to-ser (R107S) substitution in
the first helix of the protein, which is critical for the activation of
downstream genes. The mutation was not identified in 100 control
individuals.

.0002
DIARRHEA 4, MALABSORPTIVE, CONGENITAL
NEUROG3, ARG93LEU

In 2 presumably unrelated males with congenital malabsorptive diarrhea
(610370), Wang et al. (2006) identified a homozygous mutation in the
NEUROG3 gene, resulting in an arg93-to-leu (R93L) substitution in the
DNA-binding domain just upstream of the first helix. The mutation was
not identified in 100 control individuals.

600126	TITLE *600126 PHOSPHODIESTERASE 4A, cAMP-SPECIFIC; PDE4A
;;DUNCE-LIKE PHOSPHODIESTERASE E2, FORMERLY; DPDE2, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cyclic nucleotides are important second messengers that regulate and
mediate a number of cellular responses to extracellular signals, such as
hormones, light, and neurotransmitters. Cyclic nucleotide
phosphodiesterases (PDEs) regulate the cellular concentrations of cyclic
nucleotides and thereby play a role in signal transduction. PDE4A is a
class IV cAMP-specific PDE (summary by Milatovich et al., 1994).

CLONING

Livi et al. (1990) isolated a cDNA for a cAMP phosphodiesterase from
human monocytes. The deduced protein contains 686 amino acids. Northern
blot analysis detected a predominant transcript of about 4.8 kb in
primary human monocytes and placenta. Obernolte et al. (1993) identified
the monocyte clone as the homolog of rat Pde4a.

Using degenerate primers based on Drosophila dnc and rat Dpd to amplify
human Dpd orthologs, followed by low-stringency hybridization of a brain
cDNA library, Bolger et al. (1993) cloned full-length DPDE2, which they
called PDE46, and a possible splice variant. The major transcript
encodes a deduced 779-amino acid protein with 2 N-terminal domains that
share a high degree of conservation with other DPDE proteins, and a
C-terminal catalytic domain. Northern blot analysis detected a 4.5-kb
DPDE2 transcript in normal human temporal cortex. RNase protection
assays showed that DPDE2 was expressed in 6 of 7 cell lines examined.

The difference in sequence within the 5-prime region of the open reading
frame reported by Bolger et al. (1993) and Livi et al. (1990) was
examined by Sullivan et al. (1994), who confirmed the sequence reported
by Bolger et al. (1993).

Sullivan et al. (1998) characterized the first 'short' PDE4A isoenzyme.
Huston et al. (1996) had characterized the full-length human 'long'
PDE4A isoenzyme.

GENE FUNCTION

Bolger et al. (1993) confirmed that DPDE2 showed cAMP PDE activity,
which was inhibited by several cyclin nucleotide PDE inhibitors.

Wilson et al. (1994) characterized the PDE4A enzyme.

Growth hormone (GH; 139250) is an essential priming factor for the
differentiation of 3T3-F442A mouse preadipocytes into mature adipocytes.
MacKenzie et al. (1998) found that GH-mediated differentiation of
3T3-F442A cells was accompanied by increased cAMP phosphodiesterase
activity by a specific Pde4a isoform that they called Pde4a5. They
showed that activation of Pde4a5 countered GH-mediated differentiation
of 3T3-F442A cells. Activation of Pde4a5 was mediated by a
phosphorylation pathway involving Jak2 (147796), PI3 kinase (see
601232), and p70S6 (see 608938).

Vecsey et al. (2009) demonstrated that sleep deprivation selectively
impaired 3-prime, 5-prime-cAMP- and protein kinase A (PKA; see
176911)-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity in the mouse hippocampus,
reduced cAMP signaling, and increased activity and protein levels of
PDE4, an enzyme that degrades cAMP. Treatment of mice with
phosphodiesterase inhibitors rescued the sleep deprivation-induced
deficits in cAMP signaling, synaptic plasticity, and
hippocampus-dependent memory. Vecsey et al. (2009) concluded that their
findings demonstrated that brief sleep deprivation disrupts hippocampal
function by interfering with cAMP signaling through increased PDE4
activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sullivan et al. (1998) determined that the PDE4A gene spans 50 kb and
contains at least 17 exons.

MAPPING

Milatovich et al. (1994) assigned the PDE4A gene to human chromosome 19
by Southern analysis of somatic cell hybrid lines and to mouse
chromosome 9 by Southern analysis of recombinant inbred (RI) mouse
strains. Horton et al. (1995) confirmed the localization of PDE4A to
chromosome 19 by analysis of a human/hamster somatic cell hybrid panel.
Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, they regionalized the gene to
chromosome 19p13.2-q12.

Sullivan et al. (1998) determined that the PDE4A gene is 350 kb proximal
to TYK2 (176941) and 850 kb distal to LDLR (606945) on chromosome
19p13.2.

606453	TITLE *606453 LIPOPOLYSACCHARIDE-RESPONSIVE, BEIGE-LIKE ANCHOR PROTEIN; LRBA
;;LBA;;
CELL DIVISION CYCLE 4-LIKE PROTEIN; CDC4L;;
CDC4-LIKE PROTEIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Patients with Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS1; 214500) suffer from a
systemic immunodeficiency involving defects in polarized trafficking of
vesicles in a number of immune system cell types. In mouse, this
syndrome is reproduced in strains with a mutation in the 'beige' gene
that results in proteins lacking the BEACH (beige and CHS1) domain and
C-terminal WD repeats. LRBA contains key features of both beige/CHS1 and
A kinase anchor proteins (AKAPs; see 602449).

CLONING

Using a differential screening strategy to identify chimeric cDNA clones
derived from long-terminal repeat-promoted transcripts, Feuchter et al.
(1992) obtained a partial cDNA encoding LRBA, which they termed CDC4L
due to its homology to the yeast cell division cycle gene Cdc4.

By gene trapping of a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-inducible clone, PCR of a
mouse B-lymphocyte cDNA library, 5-prime and 3-prime RACE, and searching
sequence databases, Wang et al. (2001) obtained cDNAs encoding human
LRBA and 3 isoforms of mouse Lrba. Sequence analysis predicted that the
2,856-, 2,792-, and 2,579-amino acid mouse proteins (designated alpha,
beta, and gamma, respectively) all have a WD repeat-like (WDL) domain, a
BEACH domain with an SH3-binding site, and a unique C terminus. The
alpha isoform has 5 WD repeats, while the beta isoform has 3 and the
gamma isoform lacks WD repeats. The 2,863-amino acid human LRBA protein
is 85% identical to the mouse protein, and they have homology to a
Drosophila anchor protein, Akap550. Northern blot analysis using a mouse
Lrba probe revealed that expression of a 10-kb transcript was
upregulated in LPS-induced B-cell and macrophage lines. Simultaneous
multiplex RT-PCR analysis detected variable expression of the 3 Lrba
isoforms in cell lines and mouse tissues. Fluorescent, confocal, and
immunogold electron microscopy demonstrated upregulated expression of
the BEACH-WD region of Lrba in cytosolic vesicles after LPS stimulation;
it specifically colocalized with lysosomes and the Golgi apparatus. Wang
et al. (2001) proposed that LRBA is part of a WDL-BEACH-WD (WBW) gene
family. They concluded that LRBA is constitutively associated with
protein kinase A (PKA; see 176911), which, upon LPS stimulation and
BEACH phosphorylation, binds to intracellular vesicles that are
transported to the plasma membrane.

Lopez-Herrera et al. (2012) found expression of the LRBA gene in
multiple human tissues, both immune-related and nonimmune-related.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the LRBA
gene to chromosome 4 (TMAP stSG9931).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 5 patients from 4 unrelated consanguineous families with common
variable immunodeficiency-8 with autoimmunity (CVID8; 614700),
Lopez-Herrera et al. (2012) identified 4 different homozygous mutations
in the LRBA gene (606453.0001-606453.0004). The first mutation was found
by linkage analysis followed by candidate gene sequencing. Heterozygous
mutation carriers were unaffected. Affected individuals had
early-childhood onset of recurrent infections, particularly respiratory
infections, and also developed variable autoimmune disorders, including
idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and
inflammatory bowel disease. Laboratory studies showed decreased numbers
of switched memory B cells, hypogammaglobulinemia, and variable other
defects. Cultured patient B cells showed a failure to proliferate,
differentiate into plasma cells, or produce antibodies under inducible
conditions. Patient cells also showed an increased susceptibility to
apoptosis, most likely due to impaired autophagy and abnormal
accumulation of cellular organelles. No LRBA mutations were found in 12
additional families with suspected autosomal recessive CVID.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
IMMUNODEFICIENCY, COMMON VARIABLE, 8, WITH AUTOIMMUNITY
LRBA, ILE2657SER

In 2 sibs, born of consanguineous Arab parents, with common variable
immunodeficiency syndrome-8 with autoimmunity (CVID8; 614700),
Lopez-Herrera et al. (2012) identified a homozygous 7970T-G transversion
in exon 54 of the LRBA gene, resulting in an ile2657-to-ser (I2657S)
substitution in a highly conserved residue. Each unaffected parent and 4
unaffected sibs were heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found
in 128 controls. The mutation was identified by linkage analysis
followed by candidate gene sequencing. Immunoblot analysis of patient
cells showed complete absence of the LRBA protein, suggesting that the
mutant protein was unstable. Naive B cells from the patients showed
extremely low levels of IgG, IgA, and IgM antibody production and
lymphocyte proliferation when stimulated. Patient cells also showed
increased apoptosis under serum depletion compared to controls, and this
was associated with defects in autophagy.

.0002
IMMUNODEFICIENCY, COMMON VARIABLE, 8, WITH AUTOIMMUNITY
LRBA, ARG1683TER

In a boy, born of consanguineous Sicilian parents, with CVID8 with
autoimmunity (614700), Lopez-Herrera et al. (2012) identified a
homozygous 5047C-T transition in exon 30 of the LRBA gene, resulting in
an arg1683-to-ter (R1683X) substitution. No LRBA protein was detected in
patient cells. The mutation was not found in 200 control alleles. Naive
B cells from the patient showed extremely low levels of IgG production
and lymphocyte proliferation when stimulated. Patient cells also showed
increased apoptosis under serum depletion compared to controls, and this
was associated with defects in autophagy.

.0003
IMMUNODEFICIENCY, COMMON VARIABLE, 8, WITH AUTOIMMUNITY
LRBA, GLU59TER

In a boy, born of consanguineous Iranian parents, with CVID8 with
autoimmunity (614700), Lopez-Herrera et al. (2012) identified a
homozygous 175G-T transversion in exon 3 of the LRBA gene, resulting in
a glu59-to-ter (E59X) substitution. The mutation was not found in 233
Iranian controls. Naive B cells from the patient showed low lymphocyte
proliferation when stimulated. Patient cells showed increased areas of
Golgi apparatus and accumulation of autophagosomes, suggesting impaired
autophagy.

.0004
IMMUNODEFICIENCY, COMMON VARIABLE, 8, WITH AUTOIMMUNITY
LRBA, 111.1-KB DEL

In a boy, born of consanguineous Iranian parents, with CVID8 with
autoimmunity (614700), Lopez-Herrera et al. (2012) identified a
homozygous 111.1-kb deletion on chromosome 4q including exons 1 and 2 of
the LRBA gene and about 60 kb upstream and 50 kb downstream of these
exons.

147485	TITLE *147485 INTRACISTERNAL A PARTICLE-PROMOTED POLYPEPTIDE; IPP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chang-Yeh et al. (1991) cloned and characterized a novel cellular gene
that is promoted by an intracisternal A-particle (IAP) LTR and expressed
in the mouse placenta. They referred to it as mouse IAP-promoted
placental gene (MIPP). From an 8-day-old mouse embryo cDNA library, they
isolated a 1,067-bp cDNA clone containing an IAP LTR U5 region
duplicated in its 5-prime terminus and an open reading frame coding for
a potential 202-amino acid protein. Sequence of the 5-prime region of a
genomic clone revealed the presence of a solo IAP LTR with the same U5
duplication, and primer extension analysis confirmed that transcription
of the MIPP gene is under the control of the IAP LTR. Expression of the
MIPP gene paralleled that of IAP genes in normal mouse tissues with
abundant transcripts present in the placenta.

By examining the expression of the MIPP gene in other tissues of the
midgestation mouse conceptus by Northern analysis, Mold et al. (1991)
found that expression is confined to tissues derived from 2 distinct
cell lineages, the trophectoderm and primitive endoderm. The
MIPP-encoded protein is composed of four 48-amino acid units and shares
homology with a vaccinia virus gene product. MIPP-related sequences were
also found in several mammals, including the human genome. If the same
placental-specific pattern of expression is seen in humans, an
examination of the human IPP promoter could lead to important insights
into the role of retroviruses in evolution.

MAPPING

Chang-Yeh et al. (1993) mapped the human gene to chromosome 1p32-p22 by
PCR analysis of DNAs from somatic cell hybrid panels.

By study of restriction fragment length variations (RFLV) in recombinant
inbred (RI) mice, Chang-Yeh et al. (1993) mapped the Ipp gene to distal
mouse chromosome 4.

125240	TITLE *125240 CD55 ANTIGEN; CD55
;;DECAY-ACCELERATING FACTOR FOR COMPLEMENT; DAF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The major isoform of DAF, or CD55, is a 70-kD plasma membrane protein
that is widely distributed on all blood cells and on endothelial and
epithelial tissues. The physiologic role of DAF is to inhibit the
complement cascade at the level of the critical C3 (120700) convertase
step. By this mechanism, DAF protects autologous cells and tissues from
complement-mediated damage and thereby plays a role in preventing or
modulating autoimmune disease and inflammation. DAF also serves as a
receptor for certain strains of E. coli and certain types of
enteroviruses. Variation in DAF forms the basis of the Cromer blood
group system (CROM; 613793) (review by Lublin, 2005). In addition to the
major membrane-bound isoform of DAF, several other minor soluble and
membrane-bound DAF isoforms are produced by alternative splicing (Osuka
et al., 2006)

CLONING

Avoidance by host tissues of attack by autologous complement proteins is
dependent in part on the activities of membrane regulatory factors. One
molecule involved in this control is a 70-kD glycoprotein termed
decay-accelerating factor (DAF). Interruption by DAF of the complement
sequence at an early step in activation effectively halts progression of
the cascade and prevents consequent cell injury. In man, a
glycolipid-anchored form of DAF is expressed on the plasma membrane of
all cell types that are in intimate contact with plasma complement
proteins. DAF is also found on the surfaces of epithelial cells lining
extracellular compartments, and variants of DAF are present in body
fluids and in extracellular matrix. Medof et al. (1987) cloned cDNAs for
human DAF. The deduced 376-amino acid protein contains a 29-amino acid
N-terminal leader peptide, followed by 4 approximately 61-amino acid
repeats of internal homology, a 70-amino acid serine- and threonine-rich
segment with multiple potential O-glycosylation sites, and a C-terminal
hydrophobic segment. However, the sequence lacks an initiation codon,
indicating it is incomplete. Northern blot analysis of HeLa cells and
myeloid leukemia cells detected transcripts of 3.1, 2.7, and 2.0 kb.

Osuka et al. (2006) noted that glycosylphosphatidylinositol
(GPI)-anchored DAF (gDAF) and soluble DAF (sDAF) are generated by
alternative splicing. Insertion of a unique exon (exon 10) into the sDAF
cDNA causes a frameshift that results in a unique C-terminal sequence
lacking the GPI-anchored portion of gDAF. By RT-PCR of a lung cDNA
library, Osuka et al. (2006) cloned 5 additional minor DAF variants.
Three of the variants, vDAF1, vDAF2, and vDAF3, include novel exons
(exons 11, 12, and 13, respectively) compared with gDAF and, like sDAF,
encode proteins lacking the GPI-anchored portion in the C terminus.
Variants vDAF4 and vDAF5 include part or all of intron 7, respectively,
and encode proteins that retain the GPI-anchored portion of the C
terminus but have expanded central STP-rich regions. PCR analysis
detected expression of the DAF variants in almost all tissues examined,
with higher expression of all variants in lung, liver, and peripheral
blood compared with colon and stomach. The main band was derived from
gDAF. Transfection of vDAF1, vDAF2, and vDAF3 into Chinese hamster ovary
cells resulted in the secretion of these isoforms into the culture
medium. Each was highly O-glycosylated prior to secretion. vDAF4 was
expressed as a highly O-glycosylated membrane-bound protein.

GENE FUNCTION

CD55 is deficient in red blood cells from patients with paroxysmal
nocturnal hemoglobinuria (300818). Hamann et al. (1996) found that CD55
is the cellular ligand for CD97 (601211). Erythrocytes from patients
with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria failed to adhere to cells
expressing CD97.

The placenta is an immunologically privileged site. Using DNA
microarrays to compare gene expression patterns, Sood et al. (2006)
found that 3 regulators of complement, CD55, CD59 (107271), and MCP, are
expressed at higher levels in normal placental villus sections compared
with other normal human tissues. Within the placenta, CD55 and CD59 are
expressed at greatest levels in amnion, followed by chorion and villus
sections, whereas MCP is expressed at higher levels only in villus
sections. These inhibitors of complement are expressed on
syncytiotrophoblasts, the specialized placental cells lining the villi
that are in direct contact with maternal blood. The amnion compared with
chorion is remarkably nonimmunogenic, and the immune properties of the
amnion are intriguing because it is not in direct contact with maternal
cells. Sood et al. (2006) suggested that the amnion may secrete the
complement inhibitors themselves or in the form of protected exosomes
into the amniotic fluid or the neighboring maternofetal junction.

Capasso et al. (2006) showed that stimulation of CD4 (186940) cells
through engagement of CD55, either with monoclonal antibodies or with
CD97, together with anti-CD3, led to enhanced T-cell proliferation,
cytokine production, and expression of activation markers. This
activation did not affect CD55-mediated complement inhibition and
suggested a novel role for CD55.

Using differential display PCR, Brandt et al. (2005) identified a CD55
splice variant that was overexpressed in a breast cancer cell line
displaying increased transendothelial invasiveness. In situ
hybridization of tissue microarrays and RT-PCR analysis showed the
splice variant was expressed in a proportion of invasive breast cancer
tissues but not in normal mammary tissue. Western blot analysis detected
the dominant full-length protein at an apparent molecular mass of 70 kD
and the isoform at about 45 kD. The isoform was detected in cytoplasm
and secreted into the culture medium.

Group B coxsackieviruses (CVBs) must cross the epithelium to initiate
infection. Coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR, or CXADR;
602621), which mediates attachment and infection by all CVBs, is a
component of the tight junction (TJ) and is inaccessible to virus
approaching from the apical surface. Using Caco2 human colorectal
carcinoma cells, Coyne and Bergelson (2006) showed that CVB attachment
to DAF on the apical cell surface activated ABL (189980), triggering
RAC1 (602048)-dependent actin rearrangements that permitted virus
movement to the TJ. Within the TJ, interaction with CAR promoted
conformational changes in the virus capsid that were essential for virus
entry and release of viral RNA. Interaction with DAF also activated FYN
(137025), which was required for phosphorylation of caveolin-1 (CAV1;
601047) and transport of the virus into the cell within caveolar
vesicles. Coyne and Bergelson (2006) concluded that CVBs exploit
DAF-mediated signaling pathways to surmount the epithelial barrier.

GENE STRUCTURE

Osuka et al. (2006) determined that the CD55 gene contains 14 exons.

MAPPING

Lublin et al. (1987) and Lemons et al. (1987) found by study of
hamster-human somatic cell hybrids with DAF cDNA clones and by in situ
hybridization using the same clones that the gene is located at 1q32.
Thus, DAF is closely linked to structural genes for 4 other complement
proteins, C4-binding protein (C4BPA; 120830), CR1 (120620), CR2
(120650), and factor H (CFH; 134370), with which it shares 60-amino acid
repeats as well as functional similarities. Their close genetic linkage
suggests that this complement regulatory gene family evolved from an
ancestral C3b-binding molecule.

Hourcade et al. (1992) described 9 overlapping YACs that encompassed a
genomic region of 800 kb, encoding 4 RCA (regulator of complement
activation) genes and 3 RCA-gene-like elements. An arrangement of CR1,
MCP-like, CR1-like, and MCP (120920), in that order, strongly suggested
that this region of 1q was generated by a single duplication of
neighboring CR1/CR1-like and MCP/MCP-like forerunners.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Cromer Blood Group System: Inab Phenotype

The Cromer Inab phenotype, or Cromer null, in which red blood cells lack
all Cromer system antigens, is very rare. The red blood cells of
individuals with Inab phenotype have a deficiency of DAF, but they are
not known to have any associated hematologic or other abnormalities. In
the individual in which the Inab phenotype was first detected, Lublin et
al. (1994) demonstrated a nonsense mutation in exon 2 of the DAF gene
(125240.0001). The mutation truncated DAF near the N terminus,
explaining the complete absence of surface DAF in the red cells of the
individual.

In a 28-year-old Japanese woman, Wang et al. (1998) demonstrated that
the Cromer Inab phenotype was due to homozygosity for a 1579C-A
transversion at the position 24 bp upstream of the 3-prime end of exon 2
of the CD55 gene (125240.0002). This substitution resulted in an mRNA
with a 26-bp deletion, which introduced a frameshift and created a stop
codon immediately downstream of the deletion. Translation of the mRNA
would be terminated at the first amino acid of the second short
consensus repeat (SCR2) domain of DAF. The woman and her brother, who
also had the Cromer-null phenotype, had no history of intestinal
disease.

ANIMAL MODEL

Lin et al. (2002) demonstrated enhanced susceptibility to experimental
autoimmune myasthenia gravis (254200) in mice lacking Daf. Following
anti-AChR Ab injection, Daf1 -/- mice (devoid of neuromuscular DAF
protein) showed dramatically greater muscle weakness than their Daf1 +/+
littermates. Reversal of the weakness by edrophonium was consistent with
a myasthenic disorder. Immunohistochemistry revealed greatly augmented
C3b deposition localized at postsynaptic junctions, and
radioimmunoassays showed more profound reductions in AChR levels.
Electron microscopy demonstrated markedly greater junctional damage in
the Daf1 -/- mice compared with the Daf1 +/+ littermates.

Liu et al. (2005) found that Daf -/- mice had significantly enhanced
T-cell responses after immunization. This phenotype was characterized by
hypersecretion of Ifng (147570) and Il2 (147680), as well as
downregulation of Il10 (124092) upon restimulation of lymphocytes in
vitro. Daf1 -/- mice also displayed exacerbated disease progression and
pathology in the T cell-dependent experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE) model. Both T-cell responses and EAE disease
severity could be attenuated by neutralization of the complement system.
Liu et al. (2005) concluded that there is a critical link between the
complement system and T-cell immunity and proposed that DAF may have a
role in organ transplantation and vaccine development.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CROMER BLOOD GROUP SYSTEM, Inab PHENOTYPE
CD55, TRP53TER

In the first individual discovered to have the Cromer Inab phenotype
(613793), i.e., absence of all Cromer system antigens on red blood
cells, Lublin et al. (1994) found a G-to-A transition, converting codon
53 in the CD55 gene from TGG (trp) to TGA (stop). The resulting
truncation near the amino terminus explained the complete absence of
surface DAF in the subject.

.0002
CROMER BLOOD GROUP SYSTEM, Inab PHENOTYPE
CD55, 26-BP DEL

In a 28-year-old Japanese woman, Wang et al. (1998) demonstrated that
the Cromer Inab phenotype (613793) was due to homozygosity for a 1579C-A
transversion at the position 24 bp upstream of the 3-prime end of exon 2
of the CD55 gene. This substitution caused the activation of a novel
cryptic splice site and resulted in the production of mRNA with a 26-bp
deletion. The deletion introduced a frameshift and created a stop codon
immediately downstream of the deletion. Translation of mRNA would be
terminated at the first amino acid residue of the second short consensus
repeat (SCR2) domain (exon 3) of DAF. The functional domains of DAF's
complement regulatory activity and the C-terminal signal domains for
glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchoring were predicted to be
lacking in the subject. The subject and her brother, who also had the
Cromer-null phenotype, had no history of intestinal disease.

606673	TITLE *606673 BETA-UREIDOPROPIONASE; UPB1
;;BUP1;;
BETA-ALANINE SYNTHASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The UPB1 gene encodes beta-ureidopropionase (EC 3.5.1.6), which
catalyzes the last step in pyrimidine degradation, converting
N-carbamyl-beta-aminoisobutyric acid and N-carbamyl-beta-alanine to,
respectively, beta-aminoisobutyric acid (see 210100) and beta-alanine,
ammonia, and carbon dioxide (Vreken et al., 1999).

CLONING

Vreken et al. (1999) cloned the BUP1 gene. The BUP1 open reading frame
of 1,152 bp corresponds to a protein of 384 amino acids with a
calculated molecular mass of 43 kD, surrounded by a 5-prime untranslated
region of 61 nucleotides and a 3-prime untranslated region of 277
nucleotides. The protein shows 84% identity with the translation product
of the rat beta-ureidopropionase cDNA. Expression of the human cDNA in
Escherichia coli and eukaryotic COS-7 cells revealed a very high
beta-ureidopropionase enzymatic activity, thus confirming the identity
of the cDNA. Human EST libraries from brain, liver, kidney, and heart
contained partial beta-ureidopropionase cDNAs, suggesting expression in
these tissues, as seen in the rat.

GENE STRUCTURE

Vreken et al. (1999) determined that the BUP1 gene consists of 11 exons
and spans approximately 20 kb of genomic DNA.

MAPPING

Vreken et al. (1999) mapped the human UPB1 gene to chromosome 22q11.2 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

GENE FUNCTION

Beta-ureidopropionase has also been named beta-alanine synthase, since
it catalyzes the biosynthesis of beta-alanine in animals. In its active
form, the enzyme exists as a dodecamer or hexamer, whereas the enzyme
dissociates into an inactive trimer in response to its product
beta-alanine (Matthews et al., 1992).

Sakamoto et al. (2001) found that purified human liver
beta-ureidopropionase activity was inhibited by 1 mM propionate, but not
by 10 mM beta-alanine. In this regard it differs from rat liver enzyme.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Van Kuilenburg et al. (2004) reported 3 mutant alleles in the UPB1 gene
among 4 patients with beta-ureidopropionase deficiency (613161). These
mutations included 2 splice site mutations (IVS1-2A-G, 606673.0001 and
IVS8-1G-A, 606673.0002) and 1 missense mutation (A85E; 606673.0003).
Heterologous expression of the A85E mutant enzyme in E. coli yielded no
residual activity. The authors speculated that an altered homeostasis of
beta-aminoisobutyric acid and/or increased oxidative stress might
contribute to some of the clinical abnormalities encountered in these
patients.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
BETA-UREIDOPROPIONASE DEFICIENCY
UPB1, IVS1, A-G, -2

In the original patient with beta-ureidopropionase deficiency (613161)
described by Assmann et al. (1998), van Kuilenburg et al. (2004) found
compound heterozygosity for 2 splice acceptor site mutations in the UPB1
gene, IVS1-2A-G and IVS8-1G-A (606673.0002).

Van Kuilenburg et al. (2004) described a 3-year-old Turkish girl, born
of consanguineous parents, who had psychomotor and severe mental
retardation attributed to beta-ureidopropionase deficiency. The child
was homozygous for the IVS1-2A-G mutation. The mutation was predicted to
result in a frameshift downstream of exon 1.

.0002
BETA-UREIDOPROPIONASE DEFICIENCY
UPB1, IVS8, G-A, -1

In a 4-month-old boy, born of nonconsanguineous parents, who had no
detectable beta-ureidopropionase activity in a liver biopsy (613161),
van Kuilenburg et al. (2004) found homozygosity for a splice site
mutation, IVS8-1G-A, in the UPB1 gene. The mutation was predicted to
result in a frameshift downstream of exon 8.

Van Kuilenburg et al. (2004) found the original beta-ureidopropionase
deficiency patient described by Assmann et al. (1998) to be compound
heterozygous for this and another splice site mutation, IVS1-2A-G
(606673.0001).

.0003
BETA-UREIDOPROPIONASE DEFICIENCY
UPB1, ALA85GLU

In a 12-month-old African girl, born of nonconsanguineous parents, with
beta-ureidopropionase deficiency (613161), van Kuilenburg et al. (2004)
detected a 254C-A transversion in exon 2 of the UPB1 gene that resulted
in an ala85-to-glu (A85E) substitution. Heterologous expression of the
mutant enzyme in E. coli revealed no endogenous beta-ureidopropionase
activity.

.0004
BETA-UREIDOPROPIONASE DEFICIENCY
UPB1, ARG70PRO

In an Australian boy with beta-ureidopropionase deficiency (613161),
Yaplito-Lee et al. (2008) identified compound heterozygosity for 2
mutations in the UPB1 gene: a 209G-C transversion in exon 2, resulting
in an arg70-to-pro (R70P) substitution, and a splice site mutation
(606673.0001). He had multiple congenital genitourinary and colorectal
anomalies, including bladder exstrophy, anal atresia, duplicated
appendix and distal colon, and bifid phallus and scrotum. Renal imaging
showed moderate pelvicalyceal and ureteric dilatation and echogenic
areas. At age 12 months, he showed normal growth, development, and
neurologic examination. In vitro functional expression studies showed
that the R70P mutant protein had no residual activity.

182144	TITLE *182144 SERINE HYDROXYMETHYLTRANSFERASE, CYTOSOLIC; SHMT1
DESCRIPTION Serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), a pyridoxal phosphate-containing
enzyme, catalyzes the reversible conversion of serine and
tetrahydrofolate to glycine and 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate. Some
eukaryotic cells, including human cells, contain both cytosolic and
mitochondrial forms of SHMT. Mammalian cells that lack mitochondrial
SHMT activity are auxotrophic for glycine (SHMT2; 138450). It has been
suggested that glycine synthesis from serine occurs in the mitochondria,
whereas cytosolic SHMT may catalyze the conversion of glycine to serine,
although direct evidence for this proposal is lacking. Garrow et al.
(1993) cloned human cDNAs for cytosolic and mitochondrial SHMT by
functional complementation of an Escherichia coli glyA mutant with a
human cDNA library. The cDNA for the cytosolic enzyme encoded a
483-residue protein of M(r) 53,020. The deduced protein sequence shared
63% identity with that of the SHMT2 protein. By isotopic in situ
hybridization, Garrow et al. (1993) assigned the cytosolic and
mitochondrial SHMT genes to 17p11.2 and 12q13, respectively. The high
degree of nucleotide sequence identity between the 2 isozymes as well as
the presence of keratin genes in both chromosomal regions was consistent
with these regions of chromosomes 12 and 17 having arisen by a
duplication event.

Folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism is critical for the synthesis of
numerous cellular constituents required for cell growth, and SHMT is
central to this process. Elsea et al. (1995) found that the SHMT1 gene
maps to the critical interval for Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS; 182290)
on 17p11.2. They found that the gene spans approximately 40 kb. It was
found to be deleted in all 26 SMS patients examined by PCR, fluorescence
in situ hybridization, and/or Southern analysis. Furthermore,
haploinsufficiency was indicated by the fact that SHMT enzyme activity
in patient lymphoblasts was approximately 50% that of unaffected parent
lymphoblasts. They suggested that haploinsufficiency may play a role in
the SMS phenotype and that this finding may point to possible
therapeutic interventions.

Byrne et al. (1996) described an SHMT pseudogene with 90% identity to
SHMT cDNA. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, they mapped the
pseudogene to 1p33-p32.3.

176980	TITLE *176980 PROTEIN KINASE C, GAMMA; PRKCG
;;PKCC; PKCG
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PRKCG is a member of the protein kinase C (PKC) gene family (see
Coussens et al., 1986 and PRKCA; 176960).

GENE STRUCTURE

Asai et al. (2009) noted that the PRKCG gene contains 18 exons.

MAPPING

See 176960 for evidence that the PRKCG gene is located on 19q13.2-q13.4.
Johnson et al. (1988) identified an informative RFLP in the PKCC gene,
with the PIC value of 0.62, identified with the enzyme MspI.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Trask et al. (1993) assigned the
PRKCG gene to 19q13.4. Because of the simultaneous mapping of a very
large number of probes to chromosome 19, they were able to arrive at a
finer localization of specific genes than was possible when one or a few
probes were mapped.

Saunders and Seldin (1990) showed that the mouse homolog of PKCC, which
they symbolized Prkcg, is located on chromosome 7, as is also the murine
equivalent of CKMM (123310) and ERCC2 (126340).

GENE FUNCTION

Asai et al. (2009) transfected human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells with
wildtype and mutant PRKCG in a medium L-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine
(BSO), an oxidative stress inducer, and showed hypersensitivity in
mutant PRKCG expressing cells, which was correlated with increase kinase
activity. Aprataxin (APTX; 606350), a DNA repair protein causative for
autosomal recessive ataxia, was found to be a preferential substrate of
mutant PRKCG, and phosphorylation inhibited its nuclear entry. The
phosphorylation of APTX at thr111, located adjacent to the nuclear
localization signal, disturbed interactions with importin-alpha (KPNA2;
600685), thus inhibiting nuclear import. Decreased nuclear APTX
increased oxidative stress-induced DNA damage and cell death.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Retinitis Pigmentosa-11

Because the PRKCG gene encodes a form of protein kinase C that is
expressed in the retina and because it maps to the region of 19q where a
form of retinitis pigmentosa, RP11 (600138), maps, PRKCG was considered
a candidate gene for RP11. Al-Maghtheh et al. (1998) described 2
families with RP11-linked dominant RP in which a missense change
(arg659-to-ser) in the PRKCG gene cosegregated with the disease.
However, they failed to discover a mutation in PRKCG in 3 other families
with reduced penetrance showing linkage to this region. Reduced
penetrance is a characteristic of RP11: some carriers develop RP that is
symptomatic at an age before 20 years, whereas others are asymptomatic
and show no funduscopic or electroretinographic signs even at ages
beyond 70 years. Dryja et al. (1999) analyzed the PRKCG gene in 3
families with dominant RP with reduced penetrance in which McGee et al.
(1997) found linkage data pointing to RP11 as the cause of RP in these
families. None of the patients had a defect in codon 659. Furthermore,
none of the patients had an abnormality in the coding region or the
flanking intron splice-acceptor or -donor sites, except for one patient
who was heterozygous for a silent change in codon 24: GCT (ala) to GCC
(ala). Vithana et al. (2001) stated that the PRKCG gene is not involved
in RP11. They subsequently identified mutations in the PRP31 gene
(606419) that were responsible for RP11.

- Spinocerebellar Ataxia-14

In an affected member of a family with spinocerebellar ataxia-14 (SCA14;
605361) described by Brkanac et al. (2002) and in 2 of 39 unrelated
patients with ataxia not attributable to trinucleotide expansions, Chen
et al. (2003) identified 3 different mutations in the PRKCG gene, each
of which resulted in a nonconservative missense mutation in a highly
conserved residue in C1, the cysteine-rich region of the protein
(176980.0001-176980.0003). Structural modeling predicted that the first
and third of these amino acid substitutions would severely abrogate the
zinc-binding or phorbol ester-binding capabilities of the protein.
Immunohistochemical studies on cerebellar tissue from an affected member
of the previously described SCA14 family demonstrated reduced staining
for both PKC-gamma and ataxin-1 (ATX1; 601556) in Purkinje cells,
whereas staining for calbindin (114050) was preserved. The results
suggested that there may be a common pathway for PKC-gamma-related and
polyglutamine-related neurodegeneration.

Chen et al. (2005) identified 3 different mutations in the PRKCG gene
(see, e.g., 176980.0007) in 3 of 270 unrelated patients with
spinocerebellar ataxia. Two additional unrelated patients had a possible
splice site mutation. The authors noted that most of the mutations in
PRKCG reported in SCA14 have occurred in the regulatory domain of the
protein, suggesting that it is important in Purkinje cell function.

Among 284 index cases of French or German origin with autosomal dominant
cerebellar ataxia (ADCA), Klebe et al. (2005) identified 6 different
mutations, including 5 novel mutations, in the PRKCG gene in 15 affected
members from 6 French families. Combined with a previous study (Stevanin
et al., 2004), SCA14 represented 1.5% (7 of 454) of French families with
ADCA.

In a family with SCA14, Asai et al. (2009) identified a 102-bp deletion
beginning at the termination codon in exon 18 of the PRKCG gene
(176980.0009). The proband had early onset of a severe phenotype and was
homozygous for the deletion, whereas a paternal grandmother had late
onset and was heterozygous for the deletion. The parent's were unrelated
and asymptomatic, but declined genetic testing, though were assumed to
be obligate carriers.

Najmabadi et al. (2011) performed homozygosity mapping followed by exon
enrichment and next-generation sequencing in 136 consanguineous families
(over 90% Iranian and less than 10% Turkish or Arabic) segregating
syndromic or nonsyndromic forms of autosomal recessive intellectual
disability. In 2 separate consanguineous families segregating
spinocerebellar ataxia-14 (605361), they identified a frameshift
mutation and a missense mutation, respectively, in the PRKCG gene
(176980.0010, 176980.0011).

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Alonso et al. (2005) noted that mutations identified in the regulatory
domain of the PRKCG gene are associated with a relatively pure form of
SCA14 beginning in the third or fourth decade of life. In contrast,
mutations in the PRKCG catalytic domain are associated with a broader
age at onset, ranging from childhood to the sixth decade, and with
cognitive impairment in some cases (see, e.g., 176980.0006 and Stevanin
et al., 2004; 176980.0007 and Chen et al., 2005)

ANIMAL MODEL

The curly tail mutant mouse provides a model of folate-resistant neural
tube defects (NTD; 608317), in which defects can be prevented by
inositol therapy in early pregnancy. Cogram et al. (2004) investigated
the molecular mechanism by which inositol prevents mouse NTDs. They
examined neurulation-stage embryos for PKC expression and applied PKC
inhibitors to curly tail embryos developing in culture. Application of
peptide inhibitors to neurulation-stage embryos revealed an absolute
dependence on the activity of PRKCB1 (176970) and PRKCG for prevention
of NTDs by inositol, and partial dependence on PRKCZ (176982), whereas
PRKCA, PRKCB2 (see 176970), PRKCD (176977), and PRKCE (176975) were
dispensable. Defective proliferation of hindgut cells was a key
component of the pathogenic sequence leading to NTDs in curly tail.
Hindgut cell proliferation was stimulated specifically by inositol, an
effect that required activation of PRKCB1. Cogram et al. (2004) proposed
an essential role for PRKCB1 and PRKCG in mediating the prevention of
mouse NTDs by inositol.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA 14
PRKCG, HIS101TYR

In affected members of a family segregating spinocerebellar ataxia-14
(605361) reported by Brkanac et al. (2002), Chen et al. (2003)
identified a 301C-T transition in exon 4 of the PRKCG gene, predicting a
substitution of hydrophilic tyrosine for hydrophobic histidine at codon
101 (his101 to tyr; H101Y).

.0002
SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA 14
PRKCG, SER119PRO

In a woman with spinocerebellar ataxia-14 (605361) and her affected son
and daughter, Chen et al. (2003) identified a 355T-C transition in exon
4 of the PRKCG gene, resulting in a ser119-to-pro (S119P) mutation. The
mean age at onset was 42 years (range, 35 to 51 years).

.0003
SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA 14
PRKCG, GLY128ASP

In a 55-year-old man with onset of spinocerebellar ataxia-14 (605361) in
his early twenties and no family history of ataxia, Chen et al. (2003)
identified a 383G-A transition in exon 4 of the PRKCG gene, resulting in
a gly128-to-asp (G128D) mutation. His father and mother had died at ages
83 and 54 years, respectively.

Morita et al. (2006) identified heterozygosity for the G128D mutation in
a Japanese woman with slowly progressive pure SCA14. Gait difficulties
began at age 42 years. By age 62, she was still ambulatory with mild
ataxia, saccadic pursuit, scanning speech, and cerebellar atrophy, but
no other abnormalities. There was no family history of the disorder.

.0004
SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA 14
PRKCG, GLY118ASP

In affected members of a large Dutch family with autosomal dominant
SCA14 (605361), van de Warrenburg et al. (2003) identified a 353G-A
transition in exon 4 of the PRKCG gene, resulting in a gly118-to-asp
(G118D) substitution. Two unaffected members also carried the mutation.
The G118D mutation occurs in the conserved C1 regulatory domain of the
protein.

Verbeek et al. (2005) identified the G118D mutation in 8 additional
Dutch patients with SCA14. Three were sibs, and the other 5 were
independent referrals. Haplotype analysis indicated a founder effect.
Genealogic analysis of these 8 patients and the patients reported by van
de Warrenburg et al. (2003) showed that they all derived from a common
ancestor from the Dutch province of North Brabant who was born in 1722.
Some of the patients exhibited mild extrapyramidal symptoms.

By functional expression studies in COS-7 cells, Verbeek et al. (2005)
demonstrated that the G118D mutation increased the intrinsic kinase
activity of PRKCG and caused more rapid translocation of the protein to
the plasma membrane in response to calcium influx.

.0005
SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA 14
PRKCG, GLN127ARG

In all 11 affected members of a Japanese family with SCA14 (605361),
Yabe et al. (2003) identified a 380A-G transition in exon 4 of the PRKCG
gene, resulting in a gln127-to-arg (Q127R) substitution. Two unaffected
family members carried the mutation, indicating reduced penetrance of
the disorder.

.0006
SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA 14
PRKCG, PHE643LEU

In affected members of a French family with SCA14 (605361), Stevanin et
al. (2004) identified a heterozygous T-to-C transition in exon 18 of the
PRKCG gene, resulting in a phe643-to-leu (F643L) substitution in a
highly conserved region of the catalytic domain (C4) of the protein. In
addition to cerebellar ataxia, many family members demonstrated
cognitive deficits and depression. The mutation was not identified in
410 control chromosomes.

.0007
SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA 14
PRKCG, SER361GLY

In 4 affected members of a family with SCA14 (605361), Chen et al.
(2005) identified a heterozygous 1081A-G transition in exon 10 of the
PRKCG gene, resulting in a ser361-to-gly (S361G) substitution in the a
highly conserved region of the catalytic domain of the protein. The
mutation was not identified in 384 control chromosomes. Age at disease
onset in this family ranged from 5 to 60 years of age, and depression
was a feature.

.0008
SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA 14
PRKCG, HIS101GLN

In affected members of a Portuguese family with slowly progressive,
uncomplicated SCA14 (605361), Alonso et al. (2005) identified a
heterozygous 303C-G transversion in exon 4 of the PRKCG gene, resulting
in a his101-to-gln (H101Q) substitution in a highly conserved residue of
the C1 domain of the protein. Functional expression studies showed that
the H101Q mutation resulted in significant downregulation of protein
levels. Both wildtype and mutant mRNA levels were similar, and the
reduction in protein levels occurred over time, indicating that the
mutant protein is putatively targeted for degradation at a higher rate.
Thus, the H101Q mutation likely affects protein stability and may lead
to loss of protein kinase activity by changing Zn(2+) interaction and
phorbol ester-binding. The H101Q mutation was not present in 400 control
chromosomes.

.0009
SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA 14
PRKCG, 102-BP DEL

In a family with SCA14 (605361), Asai et al. (2009) identified
heterozygosity for a 102-bp deletion at the termination codon in exon
18, resulting in a met697-to-ile (M697I) substitution and a C-terminal
extension of 13 amino acids (M697Iex). The deletion was not identified
in 200 control individuals. The 20-year-old female proband was
homozygous for the deletion and developed progressive cerebellar ataxia
at age 7 years and generalized truncal and limb myoclonus at age 18
years. Brain MRI at age 16 years showed cerebellar atrophy. Her
86-year-old paternal grandmother was heterozygous and had progressive
ataxia without myoclonus starting at age 60 years, and her maternal
grandmother had late-onset Parkinsonism and died at 78 years. The
proband's parents were unrelated and asymptomatic, but declined genetic
testing, though were assumed to be obligate carriers. The M697Iex mutant
protein showed increased kinase activity compared to wildtype.

.0010
SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA 14
PRKCG, 1,717-BP DEL

In family 8600273, Najmabadi et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for a
deletion of 1,717 nucleotides in the PRKCG gene at genomic coordinate
Chr19:59086740-98088457 (NCBI36), causing a frameshift at codon 177
(val177fs), in 3 sibs with moderate intellectual disability, ataxia, and
progressive cerebellar atrophy (SPG14; 605361). The parents were first
cousins and had 3 healthy sibs.

.0011
SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA 14
PRKCG, ASP480TYR

In family M146, Najmabadi et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for an
asp480-to-tyr (D480Y) substitution in the PRKCG gene in 2 sibs with
moderate intellectual disability and ataxia (SPG14; 605361). The parents
were first cousins and had 2 healthy children.

601416	TITLE *601416 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 39 (ZINC TRANSPORTER), MEMBER 7; SLC39A7
;;KE4, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; HKE4;;
D6S2244E
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Zinc is an essential cofactor for more than 50 classes of enzymes. It is
involved in protein, nucleic acid, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism,
as well as in the control of gene transcription, growth, development,
and differentiation. Zinc cannot passively diffuse across cell membranes
and requires specific transporters, such as SLC39A7, to enter the
cytosol from both the extracellular environment and the intracellular
storage compartments (summary by Taylor et al., 2004).

CLONING

Among the many non-HLA genes that have been identified in the region of
the major histocompatibility complex (6p21.3) in mouse and human are the
genes symbolized Ke4 and Ke6 in the mouse. Ando et al. (1996) stated
that the function of these genes is unknown, although Ke6 may be
involved in the manifestation of polycystic kidney disease (PKD; 173900)
because of its aberrant expression in 2 different murine models of PKD
(Aziz et al., 1993; Aziz et al., 1994). Ando et al. (1996) isolated cDNA
clones corresponding to the human Ke4 and Ke6 (601417) genes (designated
HKE4 and HKE6 by them). The predicted amino acid sequences of HKE4 and
HKE6 exhibit 81.5 and 85.6% identity to the mouse homologs,
respectively. Ando et al. (1996) speculated that HKE4 may encode a
membrane protein with histidine-rich charge clusters.

Taylor et al. (2004) cloned HKE4. The deduced 469-amino acid protein has
a calculated molecular mass of 50 kD. It contains a cleavable signal
peptide, a long cytosolic N terminus, 8 transmembrane domains, and a
short C terminus. The N-terminal half contains several histidine-rich
repeats, and HKE4 has a central catalytic zinc-binding site and a
cytoplasmic dileucine motif that predicts retention in the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER). Deglycosylation experiments and Western blot analysis
indicated that HKE4 is a protein of about 50 kD that contains no
N-linked glycans. Fluorescence microscopy of Chinese hamster ovary cells
transfected with HKE4 revealed staining of a perinuclear network and
colocalization with an ER marker protein. RNA dot blot analysis
indicated low but ubiquitous expression of HKE4, with highest levels in
placenta, liver, pituitary, pancreas, salivary gland, kidney, and
prostate.

GENE FUNCTION

By transient transfection in Chinese hamster ovary cells, Taylor et al.
(2004) showed that HKE4 increased intracellular free zinc in a time-,
temperature-, and concentration-dependent manner.

MAPPING

Ando et al. (1996) determined that the HKE4 and HKE6 genes are located
at the centromeric end of the HLA region on human 6p21.3.

Kikuti et al. (1997) examined YAC clone Y42, which contains the MHC
class II region of chromosome 6q21.3. This region has a relatively high
gene density. They identified the following human genes (in order from
centromere toward telomere): HSET
(603763)--HKE1.5--HKE2--HKE3--RING1--(602045)--HKE6 (601417)--HKE4--RXRB
(180246)--COL11A2 (120290)--DPB2.

;;STRESS-INDUCIBLE PROTEIN 2; STI2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database analysis to identify putative coding sequences in a region
of chromosome 3 associated with carcinomas, Protopopov et al. (2003)
identified TTC21A, which they called ST12. The deduced 1,320-amino acid
protein contains 10 N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeats of about 34
amino acids each. Northern blot analysis detected strong expression of a
6.5-kb transcript only in testis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Protopopov et al. (2003) determined that the TTC21A gene contains 27
exons and spans about 27 kb.

MAPPING

Using FISH and a deletion cell hybrid panel, Protopopov et al. (2003)
mapped the TTC21A gene to chromosome 3p21.3.

611930	TITLE *611930 INTERFERON-STIMULATED EXONUCLEASE GENE 20-KD-LIKE 2; ISG20L2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Based on database sequence alignments, Coute et al. (2008) characterized
a protein, previously identified in human nucleoli (Scherl et al.,
2002), as a member of the REX4 gene family. The deduced 353-amino acid
protein, designated ISG20L2, has a predicted exonuclease domain between
amino acids 178 and 344. In S. cerevisiae, Rex4 is involved in ribosome
biogenesis (Eppens et al., 2002).

GENE FAMILY

Coute et al. (2008) stated that the vertebrate REX4 family includes
ISG20 (604533), ISG20L1 (610177), ISG20L2, and REX4 (REXO4; 602930).

GENE FUNCTION

Coute et al. (2008) showed that an EGFP-ISG20L2 fusion protein
colocalized with the nucleolar phosphoprotein B23 (NPM1; 164040).
Truncation experiments demonstrated that the C terminus of ISG20L2 was
sufficient to produce nucleolar localization. GST/ISG20L2 fusion
experiments confirmed that the purified protein possessed 3-prime to
5-prime exoribonuclease activity. Coimmunoprecipitation studies showed
that ISG20L2 associated with several ribosomal proteins through its N
terminus. When overexpressed, ISG20L2 caused a specific decrease in 12S
precursor rRNA (561000) and, conversely, an increase when it was
silenced. Based on the identified binding partners of ISG20L2, Coute et
al. (2008) concluded that ISG20L2 is involved in the biogenesis of the
large ribosomal subunit and in the processing of 12S pre-rRNA to the
mature 5.8S rRNA.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Coute et al. (2008) identified the ISG20L2
gene on chromosome 1q23.1.

DESCRIPTION

- Early Delineation

Utermann et al. (1979) described 2 phenotypes, apoE(IV+) and apoE(IV-),
differentiated by analytical isoelectric focusing. They concluded that
this polymorphism of apolipoprotein E in human serum is determined by 2
autosomal codominant alleles, apoE(n) and apoE(d). Homozygosity for the
latter results in primary dysbetalipoproteinemia but only some persons
develop gross hyperlipidemia (hyperlipoproteinemia type III). Vertical
transmission is pseudodominance due to high frequency of the apoE(d)
gene (Utermann et al., 1979). Dysbetalipoproteinemia is already
expressed in childhood. They concluded that primary
dysbetalipoproteinemia is a frequent monogenic variant of lipoprotein
metabolism, but not a disease. Coincidence of the genes for this
dyslipoproteinemia with any of the genes for monogenic or polygenic
forms of familial hyperlipemia results in hyperlipoproteinemia type III.
Further complexities of the genetics of the apolipoprotein E system were
discussed by Utermann et al. (1980). Apolipoprotein E (apoE) of very low
density lipoprotein (VLDL) from different persons shows 1 of 2 complex
patterns, termed alpha and beta (Zannis et al., 1981). Three subclasses
of each pattern were found and designated alpha-II, alpha-III and
alpha-IV and beta-II, beta-III and beta-IV. From family studies, Zannis
et al. (1981) concluded that a single locus with 3 common alleles is
responsible for these patterns. The alleles were designated epsilon-II,
-III, and-IV. The authors further concluded that beta class phenotypes
represent homozygosity for one of the epsilon alleles, e.g., beta-II
results from homozygosity for the epsilon-II allele. In contrast, the
alpha phenotypes are thought to represent compound heterozygosity, i.e.,
heterozygosity for 2 different epsilon alleles: alpha II from epsilon II
and III; alpha III from epsilon III and IV. The frequency of the epsilon
II, III, and IV alleles was estimated at 0.11, 0.72, and 0.17,
respectively. ApoE subclass beta-IV was found to be associated with type
III hyperlipoproteinemia. Rall et al. (1982) published the full amino
acid sequence. Mature apoE is a 299-amino acid polypeptide.

- Molecular Basis of Polymorphism

The 3 major isoforms of human apolipoprotein E (apoE2, -E3, and -E4), as
identified by isoelectric focusing, are coded for by 3 alleles (epsilon
2, 3, and 4). The E2 (107741.0001), E3 (107741.0015), and E4
(107741.0016) isoforms differ in amino acid sequence at 2 sites, residue
112 (called site A) and residue 158 (called site B). At sites A/B,
apoE2, -E3, and -E4 contain cysteine/cysteine, cysteine/arginine, and
arginine/arginine, respectively (Weisgraber et al., 1981; Rall et al.,
1982). The 3 forms have 0, 1+, and 2+ charges to account for
electrophoretic differences (Margolis, 1982). (The nomenclature of the
apolipoprotein E isoforms, defined by isoelectric focusing, has gone
through an evolution.) E3 is the most frequent ('wildtype') isoform. As
reviewed by Smit et al. (1990), E4 differs from E3 by a cys-to-arg
change at position 112 and is designated E4(cys112-to-arg). Four
different mutations giving a band at the E2 position with isoelectric
focusing have been described: E2(arg158-to-cys), E2(lys146-to-gln),
E2(arg145-to-cys) and E2-Christchurch(arg136-to-ser). E2(arg158-to-cys)
is the most common of the 4.

In a comprehensive review of apoE variants, de Knijff et al. (1994)
found that 30 variants had been characterized, including the most common
variant, apoE3. To that time, 14 apoE variants had been found to be
associated with familial dysbetalipoproteinemia, characterized by
elevated plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels and an increased
risk for atherosclerosis.

Data on gene frequencies of apoE allelic variants were tabulated by
Roychoudhury and Nei (1988). Gerdes et al. (1992) and Gerdes et al.
(1996) reported the frequency of apoE polymorphisms in the Danish
population and in Greenland Inuit, respectively, in relation to the
findings in 45 other study populations around the world.

- Role of APOE in Abnormalities of Blood Lipids and in Cardiovascular
Disease

In normal individuals, chylomicron remnants and very low density
lipoprotein (VLDL) remnants are rapidly removed from the circulation by
receptor-mediated endocytosis in the liver. In familial
dysbetalipoproteinemia, or type III hyperlipoproteinemia (HLP III),
increased plasma cholesterol and triglycerides are the consequence of
impaired clearance of chylomicron and VLDL remnants because of a defect
in apolipoprotein E. Accumulation of the remnants can result in
xanthomatosis and premature coronary and/or peripheral vascular disease.
Hyperlipoproteinemia III can be either due to primary heritable defects
in apolipoprotein metabolism or secondary to other conditions such as
hypothyroidism, systemic lupus erythematosus, or diabetic acidosis. Most
patients with familial dysbetalipoproteinemia (HLP III) are homozygous
for the E2 isoform (Breslow et al., 1982). Only rarely does the disorder
occur with the heterozygous phenotypes E3E2 or E4E2. The E2 isoform
shows defective binding of remnants to hepatic lipoprotein receptors
(Schneider et al., 1981; Rall et al., 1982) and delayed clearance from
plasma (Gregg et al., 1981). Additional genetic and/or environmental
factors must be required for development of the disorder, however,
because only 1-4% of E2E2 homozygotes develop familial
dysbetalipoproteinemia. Since the defect in this disorder involves the
exogenous cholesterol transport system, the degree of
hypercholesterolemia is sensitive to the level of cholesterol in the
diet (Brown et al., 1981). Even on a normal diet, the patient may show
increased plasma cholesterol and the presence of an abnormal lipoprotein
called beta-VLDL. VLDL in general is markedly increased while LDL is
reduced. Carbohydrate induces or exacerbates the hyperlipidemia,
resulting in marked variability in plasma levels and ready therapy
through dietary means. Often tuberous and planar and sometimes tendon
xanthomas occur as well as precocious atherosclerosis and abnormal
glucose tolerance. Tuberous and tuberoeruptive xanthomas are
particularly characteristic. Hazzard (1978) demonstrated the eliciting
effects of electric shock in a man revived from accidental electrocution
and later showing striking xanthomas of the palms. Development of the
phenotype is age dependent, being rarely evident before the third
decade. The nosography of the type III hyperlipoproteinemia phenotype up
to 1977 was reviewed by Levy and Morganroth (1977). Subsequent
description of specific biochemical alterations in apolipoprotein
structure and metabolism has proven this phenotype to be genetically
heterogeneous. In the first application of apoprotein immunoassay to
this group of disorders, Kushwaha et al. (1977) found that
apolipoprotein E (arginine-rich lipoprotein) is high in the VLD
lipoproteins of type III. They also found that exogenous estrogen, which
stimulates triglyceride production in normal women and those with
endogenous hypertriglyceridemia, exerted a paradoxical
hypotriglyceridemic effect in this disorder (Kushwaha et al., 1977). The
abnormal pattern of apoE by isoelectric focusing (IEF), specifically,
the absence of apoE3, is the most characteristic biochemical feature of
HLP III. Gregg et al. (1981) showed that apoE isolated from subjects
with type III HLP had a decreased fractional catabolic rate in vivo in
both type III HLP patients and normal persons.

Hazzard et al. (1981) reported on the large O'Donnell kindred, studied
because of a proband with type III HLP. They studied specifically the
VLDL isoapolipoprotein E distributions. The findings confirmed earlier
work indicating that the ratio of E3 to E2 is determined by two apoE3
alleles, designated d and n, which produce 3 phenotypes, apoE3-d,
apoE3-nd, and apoE3-n, corresponding to the low, intermediate, and high
ratios.

Ghiselli et al. (1981) studied a black kindred with type III HLP due to
deficiency of apolipoprotein E. No plasma apolipoprotein E could be
detected. Other families with type III HLP have had increased amounts of
an abnormal apoE. In addition, the patients of Ghiselli et al. (1981)
had only mild hypertriglyceridemia, increased LDL cholesterol, and a
much higher ratio of VLDL cholesterol to plasma triglyceride than
reported in other type III HLP families. The proband was a 60-year-old
woman with a 10-year history of tuberoeruptive xanthomas of the elbows
and knees, a 3-year history of angina pectoris, and 80% narrowing of the
first diagonal coronary artery by arteriography. Her father had
xanthomas and died at age 62 of myocardial infarction. Her mother was
alive and well at age 86. Three of 7 sibs also had xanthomas; her 2
offspring had no xanthomas. The evidence suggests that apoE is important
for the catabolism of chylomicron fragments. The affected persons in the
family studied by Ghiselli et al. (1981) had plasma levels of apoE less
than 0.05 mg/dl by radioimmunoassay, and no structural variants of apoE
were detected by immunoblot of plasma or VLDL separated by 2-dimensional
gel electrophoresis. Anchors et al. (1986) reported that the apoE gene
was present in the apoE-deficient patient and that there were no major
insertions or deletions in the gene by Southern blot analysis. Blood
monocyte-macrophages isolated from a patient contained levels of apoE
mRNA 1 to 3% of that present in monocyte-macrophages isolated from
normal subjects. The mRNA from the patient appeared to be of normal
size. Anchors et al. (1986) suggested that the decreased apoE mRNA might
be due to a defect in transcription or processing of the primary
transcript or to instability of the apoE mRNA. The decreased plasma
level of apoE resulted in delayed clearance of remnants of
triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, hyperlipidemia, and the phenotype of
type III HLP. In the kindred with apolipoprotein E deficiency studied by
Ghiselli et al. (1981), the defect was shown by Cladaras et al. (1987)
to involve an acceptor splice site mutation in intron 3 of the APOE gene
(107741.0005).

ApoE, a main apoprotein of the chylomicron, binds to a specific receptor
on liver cells and peripheral cells. The E2 variant binds less readily.
A defect in the receptor for apoE on liver and peripheral cells might
also lead to dysbetalipoproteinemia, but such has not been observed.
Weisgraber et al. (1982) showed that human E apoprotein of the E2 form,
which contains cysteine (rather than arginine) at both of the 2 variable
sites, binds poorly with cell surface receptors, whereas E3 and E4 bind
well. They postulated that a positively charged residue at variable site
B is important for normal binding. To test the hypothesis, they treated
E2 apoE with cysteamine to convert cysteine to a positively charged
lysine analog. This resulted in a marked increase in the binding
activity of the E2 apoE. Although nearly every type III
hyperlipoproteinemic person has the E2/E2 phenotype, 95 to 99% of
persons with this phenotype do not have type III HLP nor do they have
elevated plasma cholesterol levels. Rall et al. (1983) showed that apoE2
of hypo-, normo-, and hypercholesterolemic subjects showed the same
severe functional abnormalities. Thus, factors in addition to the
defective receptor binding activity of the apoE2 are necessary for
manifestation of type III HLP. A variety of factors exacerbate or
modulate type III. In women, it most often occurs after the menopause
and in such patients is particularly sensitive to estrogen therapy.
Hypothyroidism exacerbates type III and thyroid hormone is known to
enhance receptor-mediated lipoprotein metabolism. Obesity, diabetes, and
age are associated with increased hepatic synthesis of VLDL and/or
cholesterol; occurrence of type III in E2/E2 persons with these factors
may be explained thereby. Furthermore, the defect in familial combined
HLP (144250), which is, it seems, combined with E2/E2 in the production
of type III (Utermann et al., 1979; Hazzard et al., 1981), may be
hepatic overproduction of cholesterol and VLDL. As pointed out by Brown
and Goldstein (1983), familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a genetic
defect of the LDL receptor (LDLR; 606945), whereas familial
dysbetalipoproteinemia is a genetic defect in a ligand. The puzzle that
all apoE2/2 homozygotes do not have extremely high plasma levels of IDL
and chylomicron remnants (apoE-containing lipoproteins) may be solved by
the observation that the lipoprotein levels in these patients are
exquisitely sensitive to factors that reduce hepatic LDL receptors,
e.g., age, decreased levels of thyroid hormone and estrogen, and the
genetic defect of FH. Presumably, high levels of hepatic LDL receptors
can compensate for the genetic binding defect of E2 homozygotes.

Gregg et al. (1983) suggested that apoE4 is associated with severe type
V hyperlipoproteinemia (144650) in a manner comparable to the
association of apoE2 with type III. Vogel et al. (1985) showed that
large amounts of apoE can be produced by E. coli transformed with a
plasmid containing a human apoE cDNA. The use in studies of
structure-function relationships through production of site-specific
mutants was noted. Wardell et al. (1989) demonstrated that the defect is
a 7-amino acid insertion that represents a tandem repeat of amino acid
residues 121-127 resulting in the normal protein having 306 amino acids
rather than the normal 299. Schaefer et al. (1986) described a unique
American black kindred with premature cardiovascular disease,
tuberoeruptive xanthomas, and type III HLP associated with familial
apolipoprotein E deficiency. Four homozygotes had marked increases in
cholesterol-rich, very low density lipoproteins and intermediate density
lipoproteins (IDL). Homozygotes had only trace amounts of plasma apoE,
and accumulations of apoB-48 (107730) and apoA-4 (107690) in VLDL, IDL,
and low density lipoproteins. Obligate heterozygotes generally had
normal plasma lipids and mean plasma apoE concentrations that were 42%
of normal. The findings indicated that apoE is essential for the normal
catabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein constituents. It had been
shown that cultured peripheral blood monocytes synthesized low amounts
of 2 aberrant forms of apoE mRNA but produced no immunoprecipitable
forms of apoE. The expression studies were done comparing the normal and
abnormal APOE genes transfected into mouse cells in combination with the
mouse metallothionein I promoter. Bersot et al. (1983) studied atypical
dysbetalipoproteinemia characterized by severe hypercholesterolemia and
hypertriglyceridemia, xanthomatosis, premature vascular disease, the
apoE3/3 phenotype (rather than the classic E2/2 phenotype), and a
preponderance of beta-VLDL. They showed that the beta-VLDL from these
subjects stimulated cholesteryl ester accumulation in mouse peritoneal
macrophages. They suggested that the accelerated vascular disease
results from this uptake by macrophages which are converted into the
foam cells of atherosclerotic lesions. Smit et al. (1987) described 3
out of 41 Dutch dysbetalipoproteinemic patients who were apparent E3/E2
heterozygotes rather than the usual E2/E2 homozygotes. All 3 genetically
unrelated patients showed an uncommon E2 allele that contained only 1
cysteine residue. The uncommon allele cosegregated with familial
dysbetalipoproteinemia which in these families seemed to behave as a
dominant. Smit et al. (1990) showed that these 3 unrelated patients had
E2(lys146-to-gln). Eto et al. (1989) presented data from Japan
indicating that both the E2 allele and the E4 allele are associated with
an increased risk of ischemic heart disease as compared with the E3
allele. Boerwinkle and Utermann (1988) studied the simultaneous effect
of apolipoprotein E polymorphism on apolipoprotein E, apolipoprotein B,
and cholesterol metabolism. Since both apoB and apoE bind to the LDL
receptor and since the different isoforms show different binding
affinity, these effects are not unexpected.

Subjects with typical dysbetalipoproteinemia are homozygous for an amino
acid substitution in apoE at residue 158 (107741.0001). Chappell (1989)
studied the binding properties of lipoproteins in 9 subjects with
dysbetalipoproteinemia who were either homozygous or heterozygous for
substitutions at atypical sites: at residue 142 in 6, at 145 in 2, and
at 146 in 1.

In 5 of 19 Australian men, aged 30 to 50, who were referred for coronary
angioplasty (26%), van Bockxmeer and Mamotte (1992) observed
homozygosity for E4. This represented a 16-fold increase compared with
controls. Payne et al. (1992), O'Malley and Illingworth (1992), and de
Knijff et al. (1992) expressed doubts concerning a relationship between
E4 and atherosclerosis.

In a case-control study of 338 centenarians compared with adults aged 20
to 70 years of age, Schachter et al. (1994) found that the E4 allele of
apoE, which promotes premature atherosclerosis, was significantly less
frequent in centenarians than in controls (p = less than 0.001), while
the frequency of the E2 allele, associated previously with types III and
IV hyperlipidemia, was significantly increased (p = less than 0.01).

Feussner et al. (1996) reported a 20-year-old man with a combination of
type III hyperlipoproteinemia and heterozygous familial
hypercholesterolemia (FH; 143890). Multiple xanthomas were evident on
the elbows, interphalangeal joints and interdigital webs of the hands.
Lipid-lowering therapy caused significant decrease of cholesterol and
triglycerides as well as regression of the xanthomas. Flat xanthomas of
the interdigital webs were also described in 3 out of 4 previously
reported patients with combination of these disorders of lipoprotein
metabolism. Feussner et al. (1996) stated that these xanthomas may
indicate compound heterozygosity (actually double heterozygosity) for
type III hyperlipoproteinemia and FH.

To study the effect of birth weight on apoE genetic determinants of
circulating lipid levels, Garces et al. (2002) evaluated apoE genotypes
and plasma lipid and apolipoprotein concentrations in 933 children (491
males and 442 females), aged 6 to 8 years (mean 6.7 years), with known
birth weights. A greater effect of the apoE polymorphism on total
cholesterol (TC), LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), and apoB levels was found in
the lower tertile than in the upper tertiles of birth weight in both
genders. A decrease in TC, LDL-C and apoB associated with the E2 allele
became more marked the lower the birth weight and could be explained by
the significant positive interaction between birth weight and the E2
allele shown by linear regression analysis. Garces et al. (2002)
suggested that the interaction of apoE genotype and birth weight may be
an important determinant for atherosclerosis.

In 802 patients undergoing transthoracic echocardiography, Novaro et al.
(2003) evaluated the association between apoE alleles and calcific
valvular lesions of the heart. The authors found that the genotype
distribution of patients with aortic stenosis (AS) differed
significantly from those without AS (p = 0.03), with increasing
prevalences of the apoE4 allele (27% in those without vs 40% in those
with AS, p = 0.01). In multivariate analyses adjusting for age, gender,
LDL cholesterol levels, and coronary artery disease, increasing age and
the apoE4 allele were significant predictors of AS (OR = 1.94, 95% CI =
1.01-3.71, p = 0.046). There was no difference in genotype distribution
or prevalence of apoE4 between those with or without mitral annular
calcification, however, and the apoE4 allele was not predictive of
mitral annular calcification.

Witsch-Baumgartner et al. (2004) determined common APOE and DHCR7
(602858) genotypes in 137 unrelated patients with Smith-Lemli-Opitz
syndrome (270400) and 108 of their parents (59 mothers and 49 fathers).
There was a significant correlation between patients' clinical severity
scores and maternal APOE genotypes (p = 0.028) but not between severity
scores and patients' or paternal APOE genotypes. Presence of the
maternal APOE2 allele was associated with a more severe phenotype, and
the association persisted after stratification for DHCR7 genotype.
Witsch-Baumgartner et al. (2004) suggested that the efficiency of
cholesterol transport from the mother to the embryo is affected by
maternal APOE genotype, and that APOE plays a role in modulation of
embryonic development and malformations.

Frikke-Schmidt et al. (2007) presented evidence that combinations of
SNPs in APOE and LPL (609708) identify subgroups of individuals at
substantially increased risk of ischemic heart disease beyond that
associated with smoking, diabetes, and hypertension.

Kathiresan et al. (2008) studied SNPs in 9 genes in 5,414 subjects from
the cardiovascular cohort of the Malmo Diet and Cancer Study. All 9
SNPs, including dbSNP rs4420638 of APOE, had previously been associated
with elevated LDL or lower HDL. Kathiresan et al. (2008) replicated the
associations with each SNP and created a genotype score on the basis of
the number of unfavorable alleles. With increasing genotype scores, the
level of LDL cholesterol increased, whereas the level of HDL cholesterol
decreased. At 10-year follow-up, the genotype score was found to be an
independent risk factor for incident cardiovascular disease (myocardial
infarction, ischemic stroke, or death from coronary heart disease); the
score did not improve risk discrimination but modestly improved clinical
risk reclassification for individual subjects beyond standard clinical
factors.

Among 1,383 Scottish adult patients with diabetes taking statin
medication to reduce serum LDL cholesterol levels, Donnelly et al.
(2008) found an association of APOE genotype with both baseline and
treatment responses. E2 homozygotes achieved significantly lower LDL
levels compared to E4 homozygotes (mean 0.6 versus 1.7 mmol/L; p = 2.96
x 10(-12)). All E2 homozygotes reached the target serum LDL level,
compared to 32% of E4 homozygotes who did not (p = 5.3 x 10(-5)). The
findings indicated that APOE genotype may be an important marker for
clinical responses to statin drugs.

- Role in Immunologic Response

Van den Elzen et al. (2005) defined the pathways mediating markedly
efficient exogenous lipid antigen delivery by apolipoproteins to achieve
T-cell activation. Apolipoprotein E binds lipid antigens and delivers
them by receptor-mediated uptake into endosomal compartments containing
CD1 (e.g., 188370) in antigen-presenting cells. Apolipoprotein E
mediates the presentation of serum-borne lipid antigens and can be
secreted by antigen-presenting cells as a mechanism to survey the local
environment to capture antigens or to transfer microbial lipids from
infected cells to bystander antigen-presenting cells. Thus, van den
Elzen et al. (2005) concluded that the immune system has co-opted a
component of lipid metabolism to develop immunologic responses to lipid
antigens.

- Role in Alzheimer Disease

Saunders et al. (1993) reported an increased frequency of the E4 allele
in a small prospective series of possible-probable AD patients
presenting to the memory disorders clinic at Duke University, in
comparison with spouse controls. Corder et al. (1993) found that the
APOE*E4 allele is associated with the late-onset familial and sporadic
forms of Alzheimer disease. In 42 families with the late-onset form of
Alzheimer disease (AD2; 104310), the gene had been mapped to the same
region of chromosome 19 as the APOE gene. Corder et al. (1993) found
that the risk for AD increased from 20 to 90% and mean age of onset
decreased from 84 to 68 years with increasing number of APOE*E4 alleles.
Homozygosity for APOE*E4 was virtually sufficient to cause AD by age 80.

Lannfelt et al. (1995) compared allelic frequency of apolipoprotein E4
in 13 dizygotic twin pairs discordant for Alzheimer disease and found
the expected increased frequency of the epsilon-4 allele in Alzheimer
compared to healthy cotwins. In a well-known American kindred with
late-onset Alzheimer disease, descended from a couple who immigrated to
the United States from France in the 18th century, Borgaonkar et al.
(1993) found evidence confirming a dosage effect of the E4 allele of 6
affected individuals; 4 E4/E4 homozygotes had onset in their 60s,
whereas 2 E4/E3 heterozygotes had onset at ages 77 and 78, respectively.
Apolipoprotein E is found in senile plaques, congophilic angiopathy, and
neurofibrillary tangles of Alzheimer disease. Strittmatter et al. (1993)
compared the binding of synthetic amyloid beta peptide to purified APOE4
and APOE3, the most common isoforms. Both isoforms in oxidized form
bound the amyloid beta peptide; however, binding to APOE4 was observed
in minutes, whereas binding to APOE3 required hours. Strittmatter et al.
(1993) concluded that binding of amyloid beta peptide by oxidized apoE
may determine their sequestration and that isoform-specific differences
in apoE binding or oxidation may be involved in the pathogenesis of the
lesions of Alzheimer disease.

In a study of 91 patients with sporadic Alzheimer disease and 74
controls, Poirier et al. (1993) found a significant association between
E4 and sporadic AD. The association was more pronounced in women. Scott
(1993) pointed to the need for caution in the application of knowledge
gained through screening of E4 in relation to this very common disorder.

Talbot et al. (1994) presented data suggesting that the E2 allele may
confer protection against Alzheimer disease and that its effect is not
simply the absence of an E4 allele. Corder et al. (1994) presented data
demonstrating a protective effect of the E2 allele, in addition to the
dosage effect of the E4 allele in sporadic AD. Although a substantial
proportion (65%) of AD is attributable to the presence of E4 alleles,
risk of AD is lowest in subjects with the E2/E3 genotype, with an
additional 23% of AD attributable to the absence of an E2 allele. The
opposite actions of the E2 and E4 alleles were interpreted by Corder et
al. (1994) to provide further support for the direct involvement of APOE
in the pathogenesis of AD.

Sanan et al. (1994) demonstrated that the E4 isoform binds to the beta
amyloid (A-beta) peptide more rapidly than the E3 isoform. Soluble
SDS-stable complexes of E3 or E4, formed by coincubation with the A-beta
peptide, precipitated after several days of incubation at 37 degrees C,
with E4 complexes precipitating more rapidly than E3 complexes.

Hyman et al. (1996) demonstrated homozygosity for the E4 genotype in an
86-year-old man with no history of neurologic disease and whose autopsy
did not reveal any neurofibrillary tangles and only rare mature senile
plaques. This suggested to the authors that inheritance of apoE4 does
not necessarily result in the development of dementia or Alzheimer
disease.

Myers et al. (1996) examined the association of apolipoprotein E4 with
Alzheimer disease and other dementias in 1,030 elderly individuals in
the Framingham Study cohort. They found an increased risk for Alzheimer
disease as well as other dementias in patients who were homozygous or
heterozygous for E4. However they pointed out that most apoE4 carriers
do not develop dementia and about one-half of Alzheimer disease is not
associated with apoE4.

Kawamata et al. (1994) examined the E4 frequency in 40 patients with
late-onset sporadic Alzheimer disease, 13 patients with early-onset
sporadic Alzheimer disease, 19 patients with vascular dementia, and 49
nondemented control subjects. In the late-onset sporadic Alzheimer
group, the allele frequency was 0.25, considerably higher than the
frequency in controls, 0.09. In contrast, there was no increased
frequency in early-onset sporadic Alzheimer disease or in patients with
vascular dementia. Olichney et al. (1996) found that the apolipoprotein
E4 allele is strongly associated with increased neuritic plaques but not
neocortical or fibrillary tangles in both Alzheimer disease and the Lewy
body variant.

Kawamata et al. (1994) speculated that the lower magnitude of the raised
frequency of E4 in the Japanese group compared to that of North American
families may be due to a lower E4 frequency in the normal Japanese
population and lower morbidity from Alzheimer disease in Japan.
Nalbantoglu et al. (1994) performed apolipoprotein analysis on 113
postmortem cases of sporadic Alzheimer disease and 77 control brains in
Montreal. In this population, the odds ratio associating E4 with
Alzheimer disease was 15.5 and the population attributable risk was
0.53. Yoshizawa et al. (1994) examined the apolipoprotein genotypes in
83 Japanese patients with Alzheimer disease. They found a significant
increase in apoE4 frequency in late-onset sporadic Alzheimer disease and
a mild increase of apoE4 frequency in late- and early-onset familial
Alzheimer disease. In contrast, they found no association between apoE4
and early-onset sporadic Alzheimer disease.

Lucotte et al. (1994) examined the apoE4 frequency in 132 French
patients with onset of Alzheimer disease after 60 years of age. They
found that homozygosity for the E4 allele was associated with a younger
age of disease occurrence than was heterozygosity or absence of the E4
allele. Osuntokun et al. (1995) found no association between E4 and
Alzheimer disease in elderly Nigerians, in contrast to the strong
association reported in their previous study of African Americans in
Indianapolis. Levy-Lahad et al. (1995) found that the epsilon 4 allele
did not affect the age of onset in either Alzheimer disease type 4
present in Volga Germans (600753) or Alzheimer disease type 3 (607822).
This suggested to them that some forms of early onset familial Alzheimer
disease are not influenced by the apolipoprotein E system.

By genotype analysis of 109 carriers of the E280A PSEN1 mutation
(104311.0009), including 52 individuals with AD, Pastor et al. (2003)
found that those with at least 1 APOE4 allele were more likely to
develop AD at an earlier age than those without an APOE4 allele,
indicating an epistatic effect.

Wijsman et al. (2005) noted the wide range in age at onset of Alzheimer
disease in Volga German families with the N141I mutation in PSEN2
(600759.0001). To examine evidence for a genetic basis for the variation
in age at onset, the authors performed a Bayesian oligogenic segregation
and linkage analysis on 9 Volga German families known to have a least 1
affected PSEN2 mutation carrier. The analysis was designed to estimate
the effects of APOE and PSEN2 and the number and effects of additional
loci and the environment (family effects) affecting age at onset of AD.
The analysis showed that APOE plays a small but significant role in
modifying the age at onset in these Volga German families. There was
evidence of a dose-dependent relationship between the number of E4
alleles and age at onset. Wijsman et al. (2005) calculated an
approximately 83% posterior probability of at least one modifier locus
in addition to APOE; the fraction of the variance in age at onset
attributable to PSEN2, APOE, other loci, and family effects was
approximately 70%, 2%, 6.5%, and 8.5%, respectively.

Bennett et al. (1995) examined the APOE genotype in family
history-positive and family history-negative cases of Alzheimer disease
and found a distortion of the APOE allele frequencies similar to those
with previous studies. However, they also examined the allele
distribution of at-risk sibs and found an excess of the E4 allele which
did not differ from that of affected sibs. In these families, they found
no evidence for linkage between the APOE4 locus and Alzheimer disease.
They concluded that the APOE locus is neither necessary nor sufficient
to cause Alzheimer disease and speculated that it may modify the
preclinical progression, and therefore the age of onset, in people
otherwise predisposed to develop Alzheimer disease.

Head injury is an epidemiologic risk factor for Alzheimer disease and
deposition of A-beta occurs in approximately one-third of individuals
dying after severe head injury. Nicoll et al. (1995) found that the
frequency of APOE4 in individuals with A-beta deposition following head
injury (0.52) was higher than in most studies of Alzheimer disease,
while in those head-injured individuals without A-beta deposition, the
APOE4 frequency (0.16) was similar to controls without Alzheimer disease
(P = less than 0.00001). Thus, environmental and genetic risk factors
for Alzheimer disease may act additively.

In a review of apolipoprotein E and Alzheimer disease, Strittmatter and
Roses (1995) pointed out that isoform-specific differences have been
identified in the binding of apoE to the microtubule-associated protein
tau (MAPT; 157140), which forms the paired helical filament and
neurofibrillary tangles, and to amyloid beta peptide (APP; 104760), a
major component of the neuritic plaque. Identification of apoE in the
cytoplasm of human neurons and isoform-specific binding of apoE to the
microtubule-associated protein tau and MAP-2 (157130) make it possible
that apoE may affect microtubule function in the Alzheimer brain.
Blennow et al. (1994) demonstrated a significant reduction of CSF
apolipoprotein E in Alzheimer disease compared to that of controls. They
suggested that the increased reutilization of apolipoprotein E lipid
complexes in the brain in Alzheimer disease may explain the low CSF
concentration.

The observation that the APOE4 allele is neither necessary nor
sufficient for the expression of AD emphasizes the significance of other
environmental or genetic factors that, either in conjunction with APOE4
or alone, increase the risk of AD. Kamboh et al. (1995) noted that among
the candidate genes that might affect the risk for Alzheimer disease is
alpha-1-antichymotrypsin (AACT; 107280) because, like APOE protein, AACT
binds to beta-amyloid peptide with high affinity in the filamentous
deposits found in the AD brain. Additionally, it serves as a strong
stimulatory factor in the polymerization of beta-amyloid peptide into
amyloid filaments. Kamboh et al. (1995) demonstrated that a common
polymorphism in the signal peptide of AACT (107280.0005) confers a
significant risk for AD and that the APOE4 gene dosage effect associated
with AD risk is significantly modified by the AACT polymorphism. They
identified the combination of the AACT 'AA' genotype with the APOE4/4
genotype as a potential susceptibility marker for AD, as its frequency
was 1/17 in the AD group compared to 1/313 in the general population
controls. It is noteworthy that one form of Alzheimer disease
(designated Alzheimer type 3, 607822), like AACT, maps to 14q; however,
AACT and AD3 are located at somewhat different sites on 14q.

Tang et al. (1996) compared relative risks by APOE genotypes in a
collection of cases and controls from 3 ethnic groups in a New York
community. The relative risk for Alzheimer disease associated with APOE4
homozygosity was increased in all ethnic groups: African American RR =
3.0; Caucasian RR = 7.3; and Hispanic RR = 2.5 (compared with the RR
with APOE3 homozygosity). The risk was also increased for APOE4
heterozygous Caucasians and Hispanics, but not for African Americans.
The age distribution of the proportion of Caucasian and Hispanics
without AD was consistently lower for APOE4 homozygous and APOE4
heterozygous individuals than for those with other APOE genotypes. In
African Americans this relationship was observed only in APOE4
homozygotes. Differences in risk among APOE4 heterozygous African
Americans suggested to the authors that other genetic or environmental
factors may modify the effect of APOE4 in some populations.

In a study of 85 Scottish persons with early onset Alzheimer disease, St
Clair et al. (1995) found highly significant enrichment for both
homozygous and heterozygous APOE epsilon-4 allele carriers in both
familial and sporadic cases with a pattern closely resembling that in
late-onset AD.

As reviewed earlier, the APOE4 allele is associated with sporadic and
late-onset familial Alzheimer disease. Gene dose has an effect on risk
of developing AD, age of onset, accumulation of senile plaques in the
brain, and reduction of choline acetyltransferase (118490) in the
hippocampus of AD patients. Poirier et al. (1995) examined the effect of
APOE4 allele copy number on pre- and postsynaptic markers of cholinergic
activity. APOE4 allele copy number showed an inverse relationship with
residual brain CHAT activity and nicotinic receptor binding sites in
both the hippocampal formation and the temporal cortex of AD subjects.
AD subjects lacking the APOE4 allele showed CHAT activities close to or
within the age-matched normal control range. Poirier et al. (1995) then
assessed the effect of the APOE4 allele on cholinomimetic drug
responsiveness in 40 AD patients who completed a double-blind, 30-week
clinical trial of the cholinesterase inhibitor tacrine. Results showed
that more than 80% of APOE4-negative AD patients showed marked
improvement after 30 weeks, whereas 60% of APOE4 carriers had poor
responses.

Polvikoski et al. (1995) reported on an autopsy study involving
neuropathologic analysis and DNA analysis of frozen blood specimens
performed in 92 of 271 persons who were at least 85 years of age, who
had been living in Vantaa, Finland, on April 1, 1991, and who had died
between that time and the end of 1993. All subjects had been tested for
dementia. Apolipoprotein E genotyping was done with a solid-phase
minisequencing technique. The percentage of cortex occupied by
methenamine silver-stained plaques was used as an estimate of the extent
of beta-amyloid protein deposition. They found that the APOE4 allele was
significantly associated with Alzheimer disease. Even in elderly
subjects without dementia, the apolipoprotein E4 genotype was related to
the degree of deposition of beta-amyloid protein in the cerebral cortex.

In late-onset familial AD, women have a significantly higher risk of
developing the disease than do men. Studying 58 late-onset familial AD
kindreds, Payami et al. (1996) detected a significant gender difference
for the APOE4 heterozygous genotype. In women, APOE4 heterozygotes had
higher risk than those without APOE4; there was no significant
difference between APOE4 heterozygotes and APOE4 homozygotes. In men,
APOE4 heterozygotes had lower risk than APOE4 homozygotes; there was no
significant difference between APOE4 heterozygotes and those without
APOE4. A direct comparison of APOE4 heterozygous men and women revealed
a significant 2-fold increased risk in women. These results were
corroborated in studies of 15 autopsy-confirmed AD kindreds from the
National Cell Repository at Indiana University Alzheimer Disease Center.

Mahley (1988) provided a review documenting the expanding role of apoE
as a cholesterol transport protein in cell biology. The pronounced
production and accumulation of apoE in response to peripheral nerve
injury and during the regenerative process indicates, for example, that
apoE plays a prominent role in the redistribution of cholesterol to the
neurites for membrane biosynthesis during axon elongation and to the
Schwann cells for myelin formation. Poirier (1994) reviewed the
coordinated expression of apoE and its receptor, the apoE/apoB LDL
receptor (606945), in the regulation of transport of cholesterol and
phospholipids during the early and intermediate phases of reinnervation,
both in the peripheral and in the central nervous system. He proposed
that the linkage of the E4 allele to Alzheimer disease (104300) may
represent dysfunction of the lipid transport system associated with
compensatory sprouting and synaptic remodeling central to the Alzheimer
disease process.

Tomimoto et al. (1995) found only 3 cases with focal accumulation of
apolipoprotein E in dystrophic axons and accompanying macrophages in 9
cases of cerebral vascular disease and 4 control subjects. The results
suggested to the authors that apolipoprotein E may have a role in
recycling cholesterol in other membrane components in the brain, but
that this phenomenon is restricted to the periphery of infarctions and
may be less prominent than in the peripheral nervous system.

Egensperger et al. (1996) determined the apoE allele frequencies in 35
subjects with neuropathologically confirmed Lewy body parkinsonism with
and without concomitant Alzheimer lesions, 27 patients with AD, and 54
controls. They concluded that the apoE4 allele does not function as a
risk factor which influences the development of AD lesions in PD.

Myers et al. (1996) examined the association of apolipoprotein E4 with
Alzheimer disease and other dementias in 1,030 elderly individuals in
the Framingham Study cohort. They found an increased risk for Alzheimer
disease as well as other dementias in patients who were homozygous or
heterozygous for E4. However, they pointed out that most apoE4 carriers
do not develop dementia, and about one-half of Alzheimer disease is not
associated with apoE4.

In aggregate, the association studies on apoE in Alzheimer disease
suggest epsilon-4 accelerates the neurodegenerative process in Alzheimer
disease. However, in 3 independent studies, Kurz et al. (1996), Growdon
et al. (1996), and Asada et al. (1996) found no differences in the
clinical rate of decline of newly diagnosed Alzheimer disease patients
with or without the epsilon-4 allele.

Bickeboller et al. (1997) confirmed the increased risk for AD associated
with the APOE4 allele in 417 patients compared with 1,030 control
subjects. When compared to the APOE3 allele, the authors demonstrated an
increased risk associated with the APOE4 allele (odds ratio = 2.7) and a
protective effect of the APOE2 allele (odds ratio = 0.5). An effect of
E4 allele dosage on susceptibility was confirmed: the odds ratio of
E4/E4 versus E3/E3 = 11.2; odds ratio of E3/E4 versus E3/E3 = 2.2. In
E3/E4 individuals, sex-specific lifetime risk estimates by age 85 years
(i.e., sex-specific penetrances by age 85 years) were 0.14 for men and
0.17 for women. Houlden et al. (1998) found that the APOE genotype is
only a risk factor for early-onset AD families with no lesion detectable
in the presenilin or APP gene.

Meyer et al. (1998) presented data on an elderly population which
suggested that apoE genotype influences the age-specific risk of
Alzheimer disease but that, regardless of apoE genotype, more than half
of the population will not develop AD by age 100. ApoE genotype did not
appear to influence whether subjects will develop AD, but the study did
confirm that the apoE4 alleles influence when susceptible individuals
will develop AD. The findings could be explained by a gene or genes
independent of apoE that condition vulnerability.

Wiebusch et al. (1999) conducted a case-control study of 135
pathologically confirmed AD cases and 70 non-AD controls (age of death
greater than or equal to 60 years) in whom they genotyped for APOE
epsilon-4 and BCHE-K (177400.0005). The allelic frequency of BCHE-K was
0.13 in controls and 0.23 in cases, giving a carrier odds ratio of 2.1
(95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-4.1) for BCHE-K in confirmed AD. In an
older subsample of 27 controls and 89 AD cases with ages of death
greater than or equal to 75 years, the carrier odds ratio increased to
4.5 (95% CI 1.4-15) for BCHE-K. The BCHE-K association with AD became
even more prominent in carriers of APOE epsilon-4. Only 3 of 19 controls
compared with 39 of 81 cases carried both, giving an odds ratio of 5.0
(95% CI 1.3-19) for BCHE-K carriers within APOE epsilon-4 carriers. The
authors concluded that the BCHE-K polymorphism is a susceptibility
factor for AD and enhances the AD risk from APOE epsilon-4 in an
age-dependent manner.

Myeloperoxidase (MPO; 606989) is a potent oxidant found in immune cells
that has been detected in activated microglial macrophages and within
amyloid plaques. Using statistical analysis, Reynolds et al. (2000)
examined the relationship between APOE and MPO polymorphisms in the risk
of AD in a genetically homogeneous Finnish population. They found that
the presence of the MPO A allele in conjunction with APOE4 significantly
increased the risk of AD in men, but not in women (odds ratio for men
with both alleles = 11.4 vs APOE4 alone = 3.0). Reynolds et al. (2000)
also found that estrogen receptor-alpha (133430) binds to the MPO A
promoter, which may explain the gender differences.

Goldstein et al. (2001) genotyped 71 African American patients with
presumed AD and found that each copy of the E4 allele was associated
with a 3.6-year earlier onset of disease. The results fit a clear linear
dose-response relationship, with mean age of onset being 77.9 years with
no E4 alleles, 74.3 years with 1 allele, and 70.7 years with 2 alleles.

Mortensen and Hogh (2001) tested 139 subjects without dementia with the
Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale and several performance tests at the
ages of 50, 60, 70, and 80 years and found that there was a significant
association between APOE4 genotype and decline in performance tests in
women between 70 and 80 years, but not in men. These findings
corroborated previous findings of gender differences in the association
of APOE genotype and risk of AD.

Multiple reports have linked APOE promoter polymorphisms to AD, both in
association with and independent of APOE alleles, yielding overall
conflicting results. Wang et al. (2000) analyzed 3 promoter
polymorphisms in 237 patients and 274 controls and found a strong
association between -491 AA genotype and AD, in both E4 and non-E4
carriers. They also confirmed the well-described association between
APOE4 and AD. Wang et al. (2000) proposed a mechanistic model of disease
in which the level of expression of APOE in addition to the specific
isoform of APOE influences the deposition of beta-amyloid.

Ghebremedhin et al. (2001) examined 729 routine autopsy brains for the
classic neuropathologic findings in AD, namely intracellular
neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and extracellular senile plaques (SP), to
determine the effect of APOE genotype on the development of lesions.
Presence of the APOE4 allele was significantly associated with both NFT
and SP, but was differentially modified by age and gender: the effect of
the E4 allele on NFT was noted at ages 80 and above, but not between
ages 60 to 79, in both genders, whereas the association between the E4
allele and SP for women was found only between ages 60 to 79 years, but
not above 80 years, with no age difference in men.

Bonay and Avila (2001) presented evidence that apoE, particularly apoE4,
adds to neuroblastoma cells in culture and stimulates sulfate
incorporation on cell and extracellular matrix glycosaminoglycans. They
hypothesized that elevated levels of sulfated glycosaminoglycans could
facilitate the assembly of beta-amyloid and tau proteins in the plaques
and tangles of AD.

Lambert et al. (2001) measured amyloid-beta load immunohistochemically
in regions 8 and 9 of Brodman's area in 74 people with Alzheimer
disease. The amount of deposited amyloid-beta-40 was significantly
increased in Alzheimer disease brain samples carrying at least one APOE4
allele, compared with samples that did not (p = 0.005). There was also
an increase in amyloid-beta-40 load in individuals carrying the -491AA
genotype independent of E4 status. On the basis of these findings,
Lambert et al. (2001) suggested that the association between increased
amyloid-beta load and alleles of the APOE promoter polymorphisms is
independent of APOE genotype.

Zubenko et al. (2001) described a prospective, longitudinal,
double-blind assessment of the age-specific risk of AD encountered by
325 asymptomatic first-degree relatives of AD probands who carried the
D10S1423 234-bp allele (see 606187), the APOE4 allele, or both, after
11.5 years of systematic follow-up. They found that with the
best-fitting model, only individuals who carried both risk alleles
exhibited a risk ratio that differed significantly from 1. After
controlling for these genotypes, female gender was also significantly
associated with increased risk of developing AD.

Peskind et al. (2001) suggested that the effects of APOE genotype on the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis may be involved in the
pathobiology of AD. They examined APOE genotype and CSF cortisol levels
in 64 subjects with Alzheimer disease and 34 controls and found that
higher cortisol levels were associated with increased frequency of the
E4 allele and decreased frequency of the E2 allele. They noted that
previous animal studies had shown a correlation between glucocorticoid
elevation and hippocampal dendritic atrophy and neuronal loss, and
postulated that increased cortisol levels in patients with AD may lower
the threshold for neuronal degeneration. Sass et al. (2001) requested
that Peskind et al. (2001) provide specific information on the protocol
they used for CSF cortisol measurement. Wilkinson et al. (2001)
explicitly described the modifications they made to the commercial
cortisol assay protocol used to detect the low concentrations of
cortisol in the CSF in their study.

Scarmeas et al. (2002) followed 87 patients with early-stage AD for up
to 10 years to determine whether APOE genotype was related to the
incidence of psychiatric symptomatology. They found that the presence of
1 E4 allele conferred a 2.5-fold risk and the presence of 2 E4 alleles
conferred a 5.6-fold risk for development of delusions. The associations
were significant even after controlling for variables. No association
was found for depressive symptoms or behavioral disturbances.

In a longitudinal study of 55 patients with Alzheimer disease, Mori et
al. (2002) determined that the rate of hippocampal atrophy was
significantly greater in those with an APOE4 allele, and that the rate
became more severe as the number of E4 alleles increased. However, their
data did not support the findings of previous studies that the E4 allele
is associated with an increased rate of cognitive decline.

Dal Forno et al. (2002) genotyped 125 patients with Alzheimer disease
for the APOE allele and followed the participants for 10 years. They
found that the APOE4 allele was associated with shorter survival in men,
but not in women.

Among 1,732 patients with Alzheimer disease, Lambert et al. (2002) found
that the -491AA and -219TT APOE genotypes were associated with increased
risk for Alzheimer disease (odds ratio for -491AA was 1.7 and for -219TT
was 1.6), with age accentuating the effect of the -219TT genotype. The
authors concluded that because these polymorphisms appear to influence
ApoE levels, the results suggest that APOE expression is an important
determinant of AD pathogenesis.

Using logistic and linear regression statistical analysis to examine
clinical, pathologic, and genetic data from 128 older persons (51 with
probable AD and 77 without dementia), Bennett et al. (2003) determined
that the E4 allele was strongly associated with the likelihood of
clinical AD (odds ratio = 3.46) and decreased level of cognitive
function. However, controlling for the effect of AD pathology, including
neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, attenuated the
associations, rendering them no longer significant. Bennett et al.
(2003) concluded that the E4 allele is associated with the clinical
manifestations of AD through an association with the pathologic
hallmarks of AD rather than via some other mechanism.

In a study of 966 Swedish patients 75 years of age or older, Qiu et al.
(2003) found that 204 were diagnosed with AD during a 6-year period.
Presence of the APOE4 allele, high systolic blood pressure (140 mm Hg or
greater), and low diastolic blood pressure (less than 70 mm Hg) were
each associated with an increased risk of AD. APOE4 allele combined with
low diastolic pressure greatly increased the risk of AD independent of
antihypertensive drug use. Antihypertensive medication significantly
reduced the risk of AD regardless of APOE4 status and counteracted the
combined risk effect of the APOE4 allele and high blood pressure on the
disease.

Among 563 AD patients and 118 controls, Prince et al. (2004) found that
presence of the APOE4 allele was strongly associated with reduced CSF
levels of beta-amyloid-42 in both patients and controls. The findings
suggested an involvement of ApoE in beta-amyloid metabolism.

In a postmortem analysis of 296 AD brains, including 149 with 1 E4
allele, 38 with 2 E4 alleles, and 109 non-E4 carriers, Tiraboschi et al.
(2004) found that patients with 2 E4 alleles had significantly more
neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in all neocortical regions
compared to those with 1 or no E4 alleles. There were no significant
differences in neocortical cholinergic activity, as measured by tissue
CHAT (118490) activity, between those with and without the E4 allele.
Patients with the E2 allele had significantly decreased numbers of
neuritic plaques in all neocortical regions, consistent with a putative
protective effect of the E2 allele in AD. Tiraboschi et al. (2004)
suggested that a single E4 allele does not influence neuropathologic
severity in AD.

Huang et al. (2004) reported that 203 of 907 Swedish individuals over
the age of 75 years developed AD over a period of 6 years. Analysis of
the APOE allele genotype showed that individuals with at least 2
affected first-degree relatives or sibs had a significantly increased
risk of disease development only in the presence of the E4 allele.

Bray et al. (2004) applied highly quantitative measures of allele
discrimination to cortical RNA from individuals heterozygous for the
APOE E2, E3, and E4 alleles. A small, but significant, increase in the
expression of E4 allele was observed relative to that of the E3 and E2
alleles (P less than 0.0001). Similar differences were observed in brain
tissue from confirmed late-onset Alzheimer disease subjects, and between
cortical regions BA10 (frontopolar) and BA20 (inferior temporal).
Stratification of E4/E3 allelic expression ratios according to
heterozygosity for the -219G-T promoter polymorphism (107741.0030)
revealed significantly lower relative expression of haplotypes
containing the -219T allele (P = 0.02). Bray et al. (2004) concluded
that, in human brain, most of the cis-acting variance in APOE expression
may be accounted for by the E4 haplotype, but there are additional small
cis-acting influences associated with the promoter genotype.

Tsuang et al. (2005) found a higher frequency of the E4 allele among 74
patients with the Lewy body variant of AD (see 127750) compared to 57
patients with AD without Lewy bodies (47.3% vs 35.1%, respectively). The
findings suggested an association between the E4 allele and the
development of Lewy bodies.

In a study of 140 elderly Nigerian patients with dementia, of which 123
were diagnosed with AD, Gureje et al. (2006) found no association
between the APOE4 allele and dementia or AD.

Among 184 healthy individual with normal cognition aged 21 to 88 years,
Peskind et al. (2006) found that the concentration of CSF
beta-amyloid-42, but not beta-amyloid-40, decreased with age. Those with
an APOE4 allele showed a sharp and significant decline in CSF beta-A-42
beginning in the sixth decade compared to those without the APOE4
allele. The findings were consistent with APOE4-modulated acceleration
of pathogenic beta-A-42 deposition starting in late middle age in
persons with normal cognition, and suggested that early treatment for AD
in susceptible individuals may be necessary in midlife or earlier.

Among 100 patients with AD, van der Flier et al. (2006) found an
association between presence of the E4 allele and the typical amnestic
phenotype, characterized by initial presentation of forgetfulness and
difficulties with memory. Those with the memory phenotype were 3 times
more likely to carry an E4 allele compared to AD patients who displayed
a nonmemory phenotype, with initial complaints including problems with
calculation, agnosia, and apraxia. The memory phenotype was almost
exclusively observed in homozygous E4 carriers.

Borroni et al. (2007) also reported an association between the memory
phenotype of AD and presence of the E4 allele. Among 319 late-onset AD
patients, 77.6% of E4 allele carriers presented with the memory
phenotype compared to 64.6% of noncarriers.

Among 51 patients with probable AD and 31 patients with frontotemporal
dementia (FTD; 600274), Agosta et al. (2009) found that presence of the
E4 allele was associated with greater brain atrophy on imaging studies.
AD E4 allele carriers showed greater atrophy in the bilateral parietal
cortex and right hippocampus, whereas FTD E4 allele carriers
demonstrated greater atrophy in the bilateral medial, dorsolateral, and
orbital frontal cortex, anterior insula, and cingulate cortex with right
predominance. The regional effect was consistent with the hypothesis
that APOE may affect morphologic expression uniquely in different
neurodegenerative diseases, and that E4 carriers are at greater risk for
clinical progression.

ApoE acts normally to scaffold the formation of high-density lipoprotein
particles, which promote the proteolytic degradation of soluble forms of
amyloid-beta. The expression of apoE is transcriptionally regulated by
the ligand-activated nuclear receptors PPAR-gamma (601487) and liver X
receptor (LXR; see 602423), which form obligate heterodimers with
retinoid X receptors (RXRs). Transcriptional activity is regulated by
ligation of either member of the pair. PPAR-gamma:RXR and LXR:RXR act in
a feed-forward manner to induce the expression of apoE, its lipid
transporters ABCA1 (600046) and ABCG1 (603076), and the nuclear
receptors themselves. Agonists of these receptors also act on
macrophages and microglia to stimulate their conversion into
'alternative' activation states and promote phagocytosis.

- Role in Cognitive Impairment

Reiman et al. (1996) found that in late middle age, cognitively normal
subjects who were homozygous for the APOE4 allele had reduced glucose
metabolism in the same regions of the brain as in patients with probable
Alzheimer disease. These findings provided preclinical evidence that the
presence of the APOE4 allele is a risk factor for Alzheimer disease.
Positron-emission tomography (PET) was used in these studies; Reiman et
al. (1996) suggested that PET may offer a relatively rapid way of
testing treatments to prevent Alzheimer disease in the future.

Blesa et al. (1996) found an apoE epsilon-4 frequency of 0.315 in
patients with age-related memory decline without dementia, similar to
the 0.293 allele frequency found in an Alzheimer disease group. This
contrasted to the frequency of 0.057 found in their control group.
Payami et al. (1997) reported the results of a prospective case-control
study that enlisted 114 Caucasian subjects who were physically healthy
and cognitively intact at age 75 years and who were followed, for an
average of 4 years, with neurologic, psychometric, and neuroimaging
examinations. Excellent health at entry did not protect against
cognitive decline. Incidence of cognitive decline rose sharply with age.
E4 and a family history of dementia (independent of E4) were associated
with an earlier age at onset of dementia. Subjects who had E4 or a
family history of dementia had a 9-fold-higher age-specific risk for
dementia than did those who had neither. From these observations, Payami
et al. (1997) suggested that the rate of cognitive decline increases
with age and that APOE and other familial/genetic factors influence the
onset age throughout life.

Yaffe et al. (2000) studied 2,716 women 65 years of age or older by
cognitive testing on 2 or more visits. They analyzed change in score on
the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination as a function of estrogen
use, APOE genotype, and baseline common and internal carotid artery wall
thickening. A total of 297 (11%) women were current estrogen users, and
336 (12%) were past estrogen users. Over the 6-year average follow-up,
baseline current users declined 1.5 points, whereas women who had never
used estrogen declined 2.7 points (P = 0.023). Compared with
APOE4-negative women, APOE4-positive women had a greater adjusted hazard
ratio of cognitive impairment. There was an interaction between estrogen
use and APOE4 presence. Among APOE4-negative women, current estrogen use
reduced the risk of adjusted cognitive impairment by almost half
compared with the risk of those who had never used estrogen, whereas it
did not reduce the risk among APOE4-positive women. Compared with never
having used estrogen, current estrogen use was associated with less
internal and common carotid wall thickening in APOE4-negative women but
not in APOE4-positive women. Differences remained after adjusting for
age, education, race, and stroke. Yaffe et al. (2000) concluded that
estrogen use was associated with less cognitive decline among women who
did not have the APOE4 allele but not among women who had at least one
APOE4 allele.

Cohen et al. (2001) examined 25 healthy women with normal cognition
above the age of 50 in a longitudinal 2-year study and found that a
single APOE4 allele was associated with a significant decrease in
hippocampal volume (mean 2.3% decrease per year), as measured by MRI,
compared to the APOE4-negative group (mean 0.77% decrease per year).
These results suggested that brain structural changes may be associated
with the E4 genotype and that the changes may precede the development of
cognitive deficits.

In a 6-year longitudinal study of 611 participants aged 65 years or
older, Wilson et al. (2002) found that presence of the APOE E4 allele
was associated with a more rapid decline in cognitive functions,
particularly episodic memory, which is an early and defining clinical
characteristic of AD. To identify the determinants of normal age-related
cognitive change, Deary et al. (2002) genotyped 466 healthy subjects who
had taken the Moray House Test (MHT) to measure cognitive ability in
1932 at age 11 and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) at age 80.
Possession of the APOE4 allele was found to be unrelated to differences
in mental ability in youth, but was significantly associated with
decreased mental ability in old age and the change in ability score from
youth.

In a cohort of 180 asymptomatic individuals with a mean age of 60 years,
Caselli et al. (2004) found that carriers of an E4 allele showed greater
declines in memory performance over a median period of 33 months
compared to those without an E4 allele. Among 494 individuals with mild
cognitive impairment, Farlow et al. (2004) found an association between
the E4 allele and worse scores on cognition tests as well as smaller
total hippocampal volume. Among 6,202 Caucasian middle-aged individuals
(47 to 68 years), Blair et al. (2005) found that carriers of the E4
allele had greater cognitive decline over a 6-year period compared to
those without an E4 allele. Results for 1,693 African American patients
were inconclusive.

Among 136 patients with mild cognitive impairment, 35 of whom developed
AD, Devanand et al. (2005) found no association between APOE4 carrier
status and development of AD or further cognitive decline. After
controlling for known demographic and clinical risk factors, E4 carrier
status was associated with conversion to AD only in patients older than
70 years.

Using EEG to study 89 patients with mild cognitive impairment and 103
with AD, Babiloni et al. (2006) found that the amplitude of alpha
sources in occipital, temporal, and limbic areas was lower in patients
with the E4 allele compared to those not carrying the E4 allele.

Caselli et al. (2009) presented evidence that the APOE E4 allele affects
age-related memory performance independently of mild cognitive
impairment and dementia. A longitudinal study of 815 individuals,
including 317 E4 carriers (79 homozygous subjects and 238 heterozygous
subjects) and 498 E4 noncarriers, showed that carriers of the E4 allele
had a decline in memory beginning in their fifties compared to
noncarriers (p = 0.03). Noncarriers showed a decline in memory beginning
in their seventies. The findings indicated that carriers of the E4
allele may have increased age-related memory decline and decreased
visuospatial function.

In a prospective population-based study of 516 individuals aged 85 years
from the Netherlands, van Vliet et al. (2009) found an association
between high serum calcium and decreased cognitive function in APOE
E3/E4 carriers and to a lesser extent in E3/E3 carriers, but not in
E2/E3 carriers. The p value for interaction between APOE genotype and
serum calcium levels corrected for confounders was 0.025; the p value
for interaction between APOE genotype and serum calcium level in
relation to global cognitive function over time was 0.011. The findings
suggested that APOE genotype modulates an association between serum
calcium and cognitive function in old age.

- Role in Multiple Sclerosis

Chapman et al. (2001) reported on 205 patients with multiple sclerosis
(MS; 126200) and found that the APOE4 allele was associated with
significantly faster progression of disability. The effect was
significant after adjustment for sex and age of onset. Although the E4
allele was associated with slightly earlier disease onset, there was no
support for the E4 allele being a risk factor for development of MS.

Noting that the APOE4 allele has been associated with earlier age of
onset in AD, but not disease progression, and with faster disease
progression in MS, but not age of onset, Chapman et al. (2001) suggested
that these apparent effects are influenced by whether the diagnosis is
made late in disease course (as in AD) or relatively early in disease
course (as in MS). The authors hypothesized that the APOE4 genotype
influences neuronal disease in general via alterations in the efficacy
of neuronal maintenance and repair, and that the apparent effects of the
genotype on these 2 parameters are related to the threshold at which the
disease manifests itself clinically.

In MS, a reduction in concentration of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), which
has been shown to be contained almost exclusively in mature neurons,
reflects neuronal loss, axonal loss, and generalized neuronal
dysfunction. Moreover, the degree of reduction of NAA has been
correlated with disease severity and extent of tissue destruction. In 72
patients with relapsing-remitting MS, Enzinger et al. (2003) showed by
proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) that patients with the
APOE4 allele had a higher degree of disability and a significantly lower
NAA:creatine ratio than patients without the E4 allele. During follow-up
in 44 patients, the drop in the NAA:creatine ratio of E4 carriers was
significantly larger and was paralleled by a higher number of relapses
and a faster disease progression. Enzinger et al. (2003) concluded that
the findings indicated more extensive axonal damage associated with the
APOE4 allele.

Kantarci et al. (2004) presented evidence suggesting that the APOE2
allele is associated with lesser disease severity in women with MS, as
indicated by a longer time to reach an expanded disability status scale
(EDSS) score of 6. In contrast, Zwemmer et al. (2004) reported no
favorable role for the E2 allele in a study of 250 women with MS. In
fact, they found a trend in the opposite direction: time to an EDSS
score of 6 was shorter (6.8 years) in E2 carriers than in noncarriers
(10.0 years). In addition, E2 carriers had a higher lesion load on MRI
compared to noncarriers. In a response, Weinshenker and Kantarci (2004)
noted that the study by Zwemmer et al. (2004) had a higher number of
more severe primary progressive cases (22% of subjects) than that
reported by Kantarci et al. (2004) (6.4% of subjects), which may explain
the discrepancy.

Enzinger et al. (2004) noted that decreases in brain size and volume in
patients with MS are related to neuroaxonal injury and loss, and are a
useful surrogate marker of tissue damage and disease progression. In a
study of 99 patients with MS, the authors found that patients who
carried an E4 allele had more relapses during the study period and had a
5-fold higher rate of annual brain volume loss compared to patients
without the E4 allele. Over time, E4 carriers also had an increase in
individual lesions on MRI, termed 'black holes.' Among all genotype
groups, the lowest annual loss of brain volume occurred in patients with
an E2 allele. Among 76 patients with relapsing-remitting MS, de Stefano
et al. (2004) found that carriers of the E4 allele showed significantly
lower total brain volumes compared to MS patients without the E4
alleles. There was no difference in lesion volume between the 2 groups.
The authors suggested that the E4 allele is linked to impaired
mechanisms of cell repair and severe tissue destruction in MS.

Among 125 Greek MS patients, Koutsis et al. (2007) found that E4
carriers had a 6-fold increase in the relative risk of verbal learning
deficits compared to noncarriers. The effect was specific and was not
observed in other cognitive domains.

Among 1,006 Australian patients with relapsing-remitting MS or secondary
progressive MS, van der Walt et al. (2009) found no association between
APOE allele status or promoter region heterogeneity at positions -219G-T
(dbSNP rs405509; 107741.0030) or +113C-G (dbSNP rs440446) and clinical
disease severity, cognition, or cerebral atrophy.

Ghaffar et al. (2010) found no differences in 11 cognitive outcome
variables, including attention, processing speed, verbal and visual
memory, and executive functions in a comparison of 50 MS patients with
the E4 allele and 50 MS patients without the E4 allele who were
well-matched regarding education and disease course and duration. The
presence of cognitive impairment overall was 41%.

- Role in Traumatic Brain Injury

Among 89 patients with head injury, Teasdale et al. (1997) found that
patients with the E4 allele were more likely than those without the E4
allele to have an unfavorable outcome 6 months after head injury. The
authors discussed the role of the apoE protein in response to acute
brain injury. In a prospective study of 69 patients with severe blunt
trauma to the head, Friedman et al. (1999) found an odds ratio of 5.69
for more than 7 days of unconsciousness and 13.93 for a suboptimal
neurologic outcome at 6 months for individuals with an APOE4 allele
compared to those without that allele.

In 110 patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), Crawford et al.
(2002) tested memory and other cognitive variables and found that
patients with the APOE4 allele had more difficulty with memory than
matched patients without the E4 allele. In those with the E4 allele,
performance was poor regardless of severity of injury, whereas in those
without the E4 allele, performance worsened with more severe injury.
Crawford et al. (2002) noted that TBI may result in greater damage to
the medial temporal lobe structures involved in memory and suggested a
role for the APOE protein in neuronal repair.

In 87 patients with mild to moderate TBI, Liberman et al. (2002) used
neuropsychologic testing to examine whether the APOE4 genotype affected
short-term recovery. At 6 weeks, E4-positive patients had lower mean
scores on 11 of 13 tests, but the differences from the E4-negative group
were smaller than the differences observed at 3 weeks. Although Liberman
et al. (2002) stated that the findings are consistent with delayed
recovery among E4-positive TBI patients, perhaps due to interactions
with beta-amyloid, they cautioned against the generalizability of the
results.

Among 60 patients with TBI with a mean follow-up of 31 years, Koponen et
al. (2004) found that presence of the E4 allele increased the risk for
dementia, but there was no association between the E4 allele and
development of other psychiatric illnesses, including depression,
anxiety, psychosis, or personality disorders.

- Role in Other Neurologic Disorders

Saunders et al. (1993) found no association of E4 with other
amyloid-forming diseases, i.e., Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD; 123400),
familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy, and Down syndrome (190685). On the
other hand, Amouyel et al. (1994) concluded that E4 is a major
susceptibility factor for CJD. They found a relative risk of CJD between
subjects with at least one E4 allele and subjects with none to range
between 1.8 and 4.2, depending on the control group used. A variation in
disease duration was also noted, depending on apoE genotype, with an
increase in duration of illness in E2 allele carriers.

Frisoni et al. (1994) assessed the apoE allele frequency in 51 elderly
control subjects, 23 subjects with vascular dementia, and 93 patients
with Alzheimer disease. There was increased frequency of the E4 allele
both in Alzheimer disease and in vascular dementia with respect to both
elderly and young control subjects. There was no difference in the
proportion of E2, E3, and E4 frequency in Alzheimer disease and vascular
dementia patients. Slooter et al. (1996) compared E4 allele frequency
between 185 patients with Alzheimer disease and those with other types
of dementia. The authors found little predictive value in distinguishing
Alzheimer patients from those with other forms of dementia using APOE
genotyping. In contrast, Mahieux et al. (1994) found an increase of E4
in Alzheimer disease, but not in vascular dementia. They speculated that
the difference between their results and those of Frisoni et al. (1994)
may be attributable to the small size of the groups or to the different
mean ages of the populations that they studied.

McCarron et al. (1999) performed a metaanalysis that demonstrated a
significantly higher frequency of E4 carriers in individuals with
ischemic cerebrovascular disease than in control subjects (odds ratio,
1.73).

Tabaton et al. (1995) found that although apolipoprotein E
immunoreactivity was associated with neurofibrillary tangles in an
autopsy study of 12 patients with progressive supranuclear palsy
(601104), the apolipoprotein E allele frequency was similar to that of
age-matched controls. Farrer et al. (1995) demonstrated that the number
of epsilon-4 alleles was inversely related to the age at onset of Pick
disease (172700). Their results suggested that epsilon-4 may be a
susceptibility factor for dementia and not specifically for AD.

Mui et al. (1995) found no association between apolipoprotein E4 and the
incidence or the age of onset of sporadic or autosomal dominant
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (105400). Garlepp et al. (1995) found an
increased frequency of the epsilon 4 allele in patients with inclusion
body myositis (147421) compared with that in patients with other
inflammatory muscle diseases or that in the general population.

In a study of apoE genotypes in schizophrenic patients coming to
autopsy, Harrington et al. (1995) found that schizophrenia is associated
with an increased E4 allele frequency. The E4 allele frequency in
schizophrenia was indistinguishable from that found in either Alzheimer
disease or Lewy body dementia (127750). From the age range at autopsy
(from 19 to 95 years), they determined that the epsilon-4 frequency was
not associated with increased age.

Betard et al. (1994) analyzed allele frequencies of apoE in 166
autopsied French-Canadian patients with dementia. The E4 frequency was
highest in Lewy body dementia (0.472); presenile Alzheimer disease
(0.405); senile Alzheimer disease (0.364); and Alzheimer disease with
cerebrovascular disease (0.513). In contrast, the E4 allele frequency
was 0.079 in autopsied cases of individuals with vascular dementia but
no changes of Alzheimer disease. Subjects with vascular dementia
demonstrated an increased relative E2 allele frequency of 0.211 compared
to 0.144 in elderly controls. In contradistinction to the findings of
Betard et al. (1994), Lippa et al. (1995) found much lower frequency of
E4, 0.22, when they were careful to exclude Lewy body patients that had
concurrent Alzheimer disease by the Cerat criterion. They did, however,
find that a neuritic degeneration in CA2-3 was slightly greater in those
Lewy body disease patients with the apoE4 allele than those with the
E3/3 genotype. Hyman et al. (1995) found that senile plaques in the
Alzheimer disease of Down syndrome were abnormally large, whereas those
of APOE4-related Alzheimer disease were unusually numerous. The findings
suggested that the pathology in Down syndrome is due to increased
amyloid production and deposition, whereas that in APOE4, disease is
related to an increased probability of senile plaque initiation. Royston
et al. (1994) assessed the apoE genotype in elderly Down syndrome
patients and found that the epsilon-2 variant was associated both with
increased longevity and a significantly decreased frequency of
Alzheimer-type dementia. They noted that none of their elderly Down
patients was homozygous for the epsilon-4 allele.

In a case-control study of apoE genotypes in Alzheimer disease
associated with Down syndrome, van Gool et al. (1995) showed that the
frequencies of apoE type 2, 3, or 4 were not significantly different in
Down syndrome cases with Alzheimer disease compared with aged-matched
Down syndrome controls. The apoE4 frequency in Down syndrome cases with
Alzheimer disease was significantly lower than in any other Alzheimer
disease populations studied thus far, suggesting that apoE4 does not
significantly affect the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease in Down
syndrome patients.

Kehoe et al. (1999) showed that the APOE epsilon-2/epsilon-3 genotype is
associated with significantly earlier age of onset of Huntington disease
(143100) in males than in females. This sex difference was not apparent
for any other APOE genotypes.

Greenberg et al. (1995) found that the presence of apolipoprotein E4
significantly increased the odds ratio for moderate or severe cerebral
amyloid angiopathy (CAA; see 605714), even after controlling for the
presence of Alzheimer disease. Yamada et al. (1996) reported a lack of
association between the E4 allele and CAA in elderly Japanese patients.
Nicoll et al. (1996, 1997) did not find an association between the E4
allele and CAA-related hemorrhage. However, they did find a high
frequency of the E2 allele in patients with CAA-related hemorrhage,
regardless of the presence of AD. The authors suggested that patients
with the E2 allele may be protected from parenchymal AD but may be
susceptible to the rupture of amyloid-laden vessels.

In a postmortem study, Greenberg et al. (1998) found an association
between apolipoprotein E2 and vasculopathy in cerebral amyloid
angiopathy. Of 75 brains with complete amyloid replacement of vessel
walls, only 23 had accompanying signs of hemorrhage in cracks of the
vessel wall. The frequency of apolipoprotein E2 was significantly higher
in the group with vasculopathy. The authors suggested that
apolipoprotein E2 and E4 might promote hemorrhage through separate
mechanisms: E4 by enhancing amyloid deposition and E2 by promoting
rupture.

O'Donnell et al. (2000) identified a specific apolipoprotein E genotype
as a risk factor for early recurrence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy:
carriers of the E2 (107741.0001) or E4 (107741.0016) allele had an
increased risk for early recurrence compared to individuals with the
E3/E3 (107741.0015) genotype.

Fetal iodine deficiency disorder (FIDD; 228355) is the principal form of
endemic cretinism, and the most common cause of preventable mental
deficiency in the world. Not everyone at risk develops FIDD and familial
aggregation is common, suggesting that genetic factors may be involved.
The APOE gene encodes a lipoprotein that possesses a thyroid
hormone-binding domain, and the APOE genotype might affect the
efficiency with which thyroid hormone influences neuronal cell growth
during the first and second trimesters of fetal development. For this
reason, Wang et al. (2000) compared APOE genotypes in 91 FIDD cases with
those of 154 local control subjects, recruited from 3 iodine deficiency
areas in central China. They also genotyped 42 FIDD family cases and 158
normal individuals from the families of local controls, and 375
population controls from Shanghai. APOE4 genotypes were significantly
enriched in FIDD probands from each of the 3 iodine deficiency areas;
the E4 allele frequency was 16% versus 6% in controls. They suggested
that this phenomenon may affect population selection and contribute to
the low frequency of the APOE4 allele in Chinese compared with Caucasian
populations.

Using nocturnal polysomnography in a study of 791 middle-aged adults,
Kadotani et al. (2001) found that the probability of moderate to severe
sleep-disordered breathing (apnea/hypopnea) was significantly higher in
persons with apoE4, independent of age, sex, body mass index, and
ethnicity. See sleep apnea (107650).

In a study of 1,775 individuals, Gottlieb et al. (2004) found an
age-dependent association between the E4 allele and obstructive sleep
apnea. E4 carriers younger than 65 years had an odds ratio of 3.08 for
sleep apnea, whereas E4 carriers 65 years of age or older had an odds
ratio of 1.25. The association was stronger in those with hypertension
or cardiovascular disease.

Among 18 older adult APOE4 carriers with obstructive sleep apnea, O'Hara
et al. (2005) found an association between greater numbers of
respiratory events and lower memory performance. No association was
found in 18 older adult noncarriers with sleep apnea. The authors
suggested that sleep apnea may partly account for the association of the
E4 allele and cognitive decline in community-dwelling older adults and
postulated that hypoxia may have a role in neuronal vulnerability to
oxidative stress.

In a study of 79 patients with Parkinson disease, 22 of whom were
demented, Marder et al. (1994) found that the E4 allele frequency was
0.13 in patients without dementia and 0.068 in those with dementia as
opposed to a control value of 0.102. The authors concluded that the
biologic basis for dementia in Parkinson disease differs from that of
Alzheimer disease.

Zareparsi et al. (2002) examined the effect of the APOE genotypes on age
at onset of Parkinson disease using a population of 521 unrelated
Caucasian patients with idiopathic Parkinson disease from movement
disorder clinics in Oregon and Washington. They found that age at onset
was significantly earlier in E3E4/E4E4 patients (mean onset 56.1 years)
than in E3E3 patients (mean onset 59.6 years) (p = 0.003). This earlier
onset was not influenced by effects of recruitment site, family history,
or gender on onset of Parkinson disease.

Li et al. (2004) presented evidence suggesting that the E4 allele
increases disease risk for familial PD and is associated with earlier
age at disease onset independent of cognitive impairment; however, the
effect was not as strong as that observed in AD. In a review and
metaanalysis of 22 studies, Huang et al. (2004) concluded that the E2
allele, but not the E4 allele, was positively associated with sporadic
Parkinson disease.

Frikke-Schmidt et al. (2001) genotyped over 9,000 individuals and found
no association between APOE genotype and ischemic cerebrovascular
disease, defined as the sudden onset of focal neurologic symptoms.
However, they did find an association between the genotype E4E3 and
'other dementia,' which included vascular dementia, alcohol-induced
dementia, and unclassifiable dementia. They confirmed the findings of
previous studies that APOE genotypes E4E3 and E4E4 are significant risk
factors for AD. The increases in all dementia risks were independent of
plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels.

Broderick et al. (2001) examined data from a tissue plasminogen
activator (t-PA; 173370) trial and concluded that the efficacy of
intravenous t-PA in patients with acute ischemic stroke, as measured by
favorable outcome at 3 months, may be enhanced in those with an APOE E2
phenotype.

Verpillat et al. (2002) determined the APOE genotype frequencies in 94
unrelated patients with frontotemporal dementia (600274) and 392 age-
and sex-matched controls without cognitive deficits or behavioral
disturbances (after excluding 6 patients with autosomal dominant
inheritance and mutation in the MAPT gene). Homozygosity for the E2E2
genotype was significantly associated with frontotemporal dementia (odds
ratio = 11.3, P = 0.033, exact test) but was based on very few subjects
(3 patients and 1 control). The result was even more significant in the
group with a positive familial history (odds ratio = 23.8, P = 0.019,
exact test). For the metaanalysis of the APOE polymorphism in
frontotemporal dementia, Verpillat et al. (2002) pooled 10 case-control
studies with available genotype or allele information (total of 364
patients and 2,671 controls), but the E2E2 genotype did not reach
statistical significance. Because of heterogeneity, Verpillat et al.
(2002) analyzed on one hand the neuropathologically-confirmed studies,
and on the other hand the clinical-based studies. A significant increase
in the E2 allele frequency was found in the
neuropathologically-confirmed patients, and heterogeneity disappeared
(Mantel-Haenszel statistics). The authors concluded that the APOE E2
allele may be a risk factor for frontotemporal dementia, but that the
data should be interpreted with caution due to the rarity of the E2E2
genotype.

Matsumoto et al. (2003) provided evidence suggesting that patients with
primary dystonia who have the APOE4 genotype have an earlier age at
disease onset than APOE4 noncarriers with dystonia, which they suggested
was caused in part by a defect in neuronal repair in those with the
APOE4 allele.

In a large population-based study of 9,294 French individuals, Dufouil
et al. (2005) found a decreased risk for the development of non-AD
dementia among those who used lipid lowering agents and maintained
normal lipid levels. The odds for non-AD dementia were increased in
subjects with hyperlipidemia. The findings were not modified by APOE
genotype.

Among 32 patients with a clinical diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia,
including 15 patient with primary progressive aphasia, Acciarri et al.
(2006) found increased frequency of the E2 and E4 alleles and
significantly decreased frequency of the E3 allele compared to 87
control individuals. The E2E4 genotype in particular was significantly
associated with primary progressive aphasia.

Among 87 patients with medically intractable temporal lobe epilepsy
necessitating temporal lobectomy, Busch et al. (2007) found that the
presence of the E4 allele was associated with significantly reduced
verbal and nonverbal memory in those with a long duration of epilepsy
(greater than 22 years), particularly in those with an earlier age at
onset. Busch et al. (2007) suggested that medically refractory seizures
are similar to traumatic brain injury and that neuronal recovery after
seizures may be impaired by the presence of the E4 allele. Surgery had
no significant effects on the results.

In a metaanalysis including 8 published studies comprising 696 patients
with subarachnoid hemorrhage, Lanterna et al. (2007) found that patients
with the E4 allele had approximately 2-fold increased risk of negative
outcome and delayed ischemia compared to those without the allele.

Gozal et al. (2007) found that the E4 allele was more common in nonobese
children with obstructive sleep apnea (107650) compared to controls, and
particularly in those who developed neurocognitive deficits.

- Role in Ocular Disorders

Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG; 137760) is an optic neuropathy that
has a high worldwide prevalence and that shows strong evidence of
complex inheritance. The myocilin gene (MYOC; 601652) has been shown to
have mutations in patients with POAG. Apolipoprotein E plays an
essential role in lipid metabolism, and the APOE gene has been involved
in the neuronal degeneration that occurs in Alzheimer disease. Copin et
al. (2002) reported that 2 APOE-promoter single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) previously associated with Alzheimer disease also modified the
POAG phenotype. APOE(-219G) is associated with increased optic nerve
damage, as reflected by increased cup:disc ratio and visual field
alteration. In addition, APOE(-491T), interacting at a highly
significant level with a SNP in the MYOC promoter, MYOC(-1000G), is
associated with increased intraocular pressure (IOP) and with limited
effectiveness of IOP-lowering treatments in patients with POAG.
Together, these findings establish APOE as a potent modifier for POAG,
which could explain the linkage to chromosome 19q previously observed by
use of a genome scan for this condition (Wiggs et al., 2000) and an
increased frequency of glaucoma in patients with Alzheimer disease
(Bayer et al., 2002). The findings also shed new light on potential
mechanisms of optic nerve damage and of IOP regulation in POAG. Bunce et
al. (2003) criticized the statistical approach used by Copin et al.
(2002) and concluded that without supportive clinical data, evidence is
lacking that APOE SNPs either are associated with a more severe
phenotype or interact at a highly significant level with a SNP in the
MYOC promoter.

Zetterberg et al. (2007) studied the association of AD-associated APOE
polymorphisms in 242 patients with POAG and 187 controls. They found no
differences between patients and controls with regard to APOE genotypes.

Because clinical studies had shown an association between glaucoma and
AD (Bayer et al., 2002), which is also a complex trait, Ressiniotis et
al. (2004) examined DNA from 137 unrelated patients with POAG and 75
control subjects. In this cohort, APOE genotype did not constitute a
risk factor for developing POAG, even in patients with normal tension
glaucoma. The authors concluded that APOE polymorphisms did not appear
to be contributory to POAG.

The inheritance of specific ApoE alleles is linked to the incidence of
age-related macular degeneration (ARMD; see 603075). ApoE appears to be
a ubiquitous component of drusen, which are the hallmark of ARMD
irrespective of clinical phenotype. Anderson et al. (2001) found ApoE
located at the same anatomic locus at which drusen are situated and
suggested that the retinal pigment epithelium is the most likely local
biosynthetic source of ApoE at that site. They concluded that
age-related alteration of lipoprotein biosynthesis and/or processing at
the level of the retinal pigment epithelium and/or Bruch membrane might
be a significant contributing factor in drusen formation and ARMD
pathogenesis.

Schultz et al. (2003) found no evidence to support an association
between ARMD in medium to large families and the E4 or E2 alleles of
ApoE. They also found no evidence for an association of ApoE
polymorphisms in a set of unrelated patients with ARMD. They did,
however, find a trend for a decreased risk of ARMD associated with ApoE4
in a set of unrelated patients with a family history of ARMD.

Baird et al. (2006) studied progression of ARMD in a cohort of 238
individuals from a single center. Individuals with an E2 genotype
(526C-T; 107741.0001) of the APOE gene showed a strong association with
disease with a significant 4.8-fold increased relative risk compared to
individuals with an E4 genotype (388T-C; 107741.0016) (odds ratio, 4.8)
and a nearly significant 3-fold increased relative risk compared to
individuals with an E3 (107741.0015) genotype. This finding was present
only in females who progressed with ARMD, which suggested that there may
be a gender-specific role in progression of ARMD in individuals with an
E2 allele.

Bojanowski et al. (2006) investigated the association between apoE2
(158C), apoE3, and apoE4 (112R) variants and ARMD in 133 clinically
screened controls, 94 volunteers with a younger mean age, 120 patients
with advanced ARMD, and 40 archived ocular ARMD slides. They also tested
the effects of recombinant apoE variants on the expression of a
chemokine (CCL2; 158105), a chemokine receptor (CX3CR1; 601470), and a
cytokine (VEGF; 192240) in cultured human retinal pigment epithelial
(RPE) cells and analyzed the serum cholesterol profiles of the
clinically screened subjects. The apoE4 distribution differed
significantly between ARMD patients and controls. The arg112 allele
frequency was 10.9% in the ARMD group when compared with 16.5% in the
younger controls and 18.8% in the clinically screened controls. The
pathologically diagnosed archived ARMD cases had the lowest allele
frequency of 5%. No significant differences in apoE2 distribution were
observed among the groups. A metaanalysis of 8 cohorts, including 4,289
subjects, showed a strong association between ARMD and 112R, but not
158C. In vitro studies found that recombinant apoE suppressed CCL2 and
VEGF expression in RPE cells. However, the E4 isoform showed more
suppression than E3 in both cases. Bojanowski et al. (2006) concluded
that these results further confirm the association between apoE4 and a
decreased risk of ARMD development. They suggested that the underlying
mechanisms may involve differential regulation of both CCL2 and VEGF by
the apoE isoforms.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using a yeast 1-hybrid screen with the proximal region of the APOE
promoter as bait, Salero et al. (2001) isolated cDNAs encoding the ZIC1
(600470) and ZIC2 (603073) transcription factors. Electrophoretic
mobility shift and mutational analyses identified binding sites in the
-136 to -125, -65 to -54, and -185 to -174 regions of the APOE promoter.
Luciferase reporter analysis showed that the ZIC proteins stimulate
potent transcriptional activation of APOE through these binding sites.

Using a variety of structural tools, Morrow et al. (2002) determined
that the 22 kD N terminus of APOE4 forms a stable folding intermediate
(called a molten globule structure) more readily than does APOE3 or
APOE2. They concluded that the differential abilities of the APOE
isoforms to form a molten globule may contribute to the isoform-specific
effects of APOE in disease.

Infante-Rivard et al. (2003) studied the transmission of the 3 APOE
alleles from heterozygous parents to newborns with intrauterine growth
restriction (IUGR), defined as birth weight below the 10th centile for
gestational age and sex, based on Canadian standards. They found a
significantly reduced transmission of the E2 allele. The E2 allele had
been associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease and babies
born with growth restriction had been reported to be at higher risk for
such disease later in life; the data seemed to reconcile these 2
observations.

To investigate the association of APOE and TGFB1 (190180) with obesity,
Long et al. (2003) analyzed several SNPs of each gene in 1,873 subjects
from 405 white families to test for linkage or association with 4
obesity phenotypes including BMI, fat mass, percentage fat mass (PFM),
and lean mass, with the latter 3 being measured by dual energy x-ray
absorptiometry. A significant linkage disequilibrium (p less than 0.01)
was observed between pairs of SNPs within each gene except for SNP5 and
SNP6 in TGFB1 (p greater than 0.01). Within-family association was
observed in the APOE gene for SNP1 and PFM (p = 0.001) and for the CGTC
haplotype with both fat mass (p = 0.012) and PFM (p = 0.006). For the
TGFB1 gene, within-family association was found between lean mass and
SNP5 (p = 0.003), haplotype C+C (p = 0.12), and haplotype T+C (p =
0.012). Long et al. (2003) concluded that the large study size,
analytical method, and inclusion of the lean mass phenotype improved the
power of their study and explained discrepancies in previous studies,
and that both APOE and TGFB1 are associated with obesity phenotypes in
their population.

In a review of genetic determinants of human longevity, Christensen et
al. (2006) pointed out that polymorphism in the APOE gene has
consistently been found to be associated with survival and longevity
(Gerdes et al., 2000).

Price et al. (2006) noted that hepatitis C virus (HCV; see 609532) RNA
is associated with low and very low density lipoproteins, and that HCV
uptake through LDLR into hepatocyte cell lines can be blocked by
anti-APOB and anti-APOE. They evaluated APOE genotypes in 420 Northern
Europeans with evidence of HCV exposure. Both APOE2 and APOE4 alleles
were associated with reduced likelihood of chronic infection, and no
APOE2 homozygotes were HCV seropositive. Price et al. (2006) concluded
that APOE2 and APOE4 alleles favor HCV clearance.

Burt et al. (2008) examined a large cohort of human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV; see 609423)-positive European and African American subjects
and found that those homozygous for APOE4 had an accelerated disease
course and progression to death compared with those homozygous for
APOE3. The increased risk was independent of CD4 (186940)-positive
T-cell count, delayed-type hypersensitivity reactivity, and CCL3L1
(601395)-CCR5 (601373) type. APOE4 alleles showed a weak association
with higher viral load. No association was observed with APOE4
homozygosity and HIV-associated dementia or with an increased risk of
acquiring HIV infection. Expression of recombinant APOE4 or APOE3 in
HeLa cells also expressing CD4 and CCR5 revealed that the presence of
APOE4 enhanced HIV fusion/cell entry of both R5 (macrophage-tropic) and
X4 (T lymphocyte-tropic) HIV strains in vitro. Burt et al. (2008)
concluded that APOE4 is a determinant of AIDS pathogenesis.

MAPPING

Olaisen et al. (1982) found linkage of C3 (120700) and apoE with a lod
score of 3.00 in males at a recombination fraction of 13%. Since the C3
locus is on chromosome 19, apoE can be assigned to that chromosome also.
The authors stated that preliminary evidence suggested that the apoE
locus is close to the secretor locus (182100). Berg et al. (1984)
studied apoE-C3 linkage with a C3 restriction fragment length
polymorphism. Low positive lod scores were found when segregation was
from a male (highest score at recombination fraction 0.17). Using DNA
probes, Das et al. (1985) mapped the apoE gene to chromosome 19 by
Southern blot analysis of DNA from human-rodent somatic cell hybrids.
Humphries et al. (1984) used a common TaqI RFLP near the APOC2 gene to
demonstrate close linkage to APOE in 7 families segregating for APOE
protein variants. No recombination was observed in 20 opportunities.
Apparent linkage disequilibrium was observed. On the other hand,
Houlston et al. (1989), using a robust PCR-based method for apoE
genotyping, found no strong linkage disequilibrium between the APOE and
APOC2 loci. Gedde-Dahl et al. (1984) found linkage between Se and APOE
with a peak lod score of 3.3 at recombination fraction of 0.08 in males
and 1.36 at 0.22 in females, and linkage between APOE and Lu with a lod
score 4.52 at zero recombination (sexes combined). The C3-APOE linkage
gave lod score 4.00 at theta 0.18 in males and 0.04 at theta 0.45 in
females. Triply heterozygous families confirmed that APOE is on the Se
side and on the Lu side of C3. Lusis et al. (1986) used a reciprocal
whole arm translocation between the long arm of 19 and the short arm of
chromosome 1 to map APOC1, APOC2, APOE and GPI to the long arm and LDLR,
C3 and PEPD to the short arm. Furthermore, they isolated a single lambda
phage that carried both APOC1 and APOE separated by about 6 kb of
genomic DNA. Since family studies indicate close linkage of APOE and
APOC2, the 3 must be in a cluster on 19q.

Fullerton et al. (2000) studied sequence haplotype variation in 5.5 kb
of genomic DNA encompassing the whole of the APOE locus and adjoining
flanking regions in 96 individuals from 4 populations (48 chromosomes
from each group): blacks from Jackson, Mississippi, Mayans from
Campeche, Mexico, Finns from North Karelia, Finland, and non-Hispanic
whites from Rochester, Minnesota. They identified 22 diallelic sites
defining 31 distinct haplotypes. Sequence analysis of the chimpanzee
APOE gene showed that it is most closely related to human E4-type
haplotypes. The evolutionary history of allelic divergence within humans
was inferred from the pattern of haplotype relationships. Sequence
analysis suggested that haplotypes defining the E3 and E2 alleles were
derived from the ancestral E4 and that the E3 group of haplotypes had
increased in frequency, relative to E4, in the past 200,000 years.
Substantial heterogeneity was found within all 3 classes of sequence
haplotypes, and there were important interpopulation differences in the
sequence variation underlying the protein isoforms that may be relevant
to interpreting conflicting reports of phenotypic associations with
variation in the common protein isoforms.

POPULATION GENETICS

Corbo and Scacchi (1999) analyzed the APOE allele distribution in the
world. They pointed out that the APOE3 allele is the most frequent in
all human groups, especially in populations with a long-established
agricultural economy such as those of the Mediterranean basin, where the
allele frequency is 0.849-0.898. The frequency of the APOE4 allele, the
ancestral allele, remains higher in populations such as Pygmies (0.407)
and Khoi San (0.370), aborigines of Malaysia (0.240) and Australia
(0.260), Papuans (0.368), some Native Americans (0.280), and Lapps
(0.310) where an economy of foraging still exists, or food supply is (or
was until shortly before the time of the report) scarce and sporadically
available. The APOE2 frequency fluctuates with no apparent trend
(0.145-0.02) and is absent in Native Americans. Corbo and Scacchi (1999)
suggested that the APOE4 allele, based on some functional properties,
may be a 'thrifty' allele. The exposure of APOE4 to the environmental
conditions at the time of the report (Western diet, longer life spans)
may have rendered it a susceptibility allele for coronary artery disease
and Alzheimer disease. The absence of the association of APOE4 with
either disorder in sub-Saharan Africans, and the presence of the
association in African Americans, seems to confirm this hypothesis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Because apolipoprotein E is a ligand for receptors that clear remnants
of chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins, lack of apoE would be
expected to cause accumulation in plasma of cholesterol-rich remnants
whose prolonged circulation should be atherogenic. Zhang et al. (1992)
demonstrated that this was indeed the case: apoE-deficient mice
generated by gene targeting (Piedrahita et al., 1992) had 5 times normal
plasma cholesterol and developed foam cell-rich depositions in their
proximal aortas by age 3 months. These spontaneous lesions progressed
and caused severe occlusion of the coronary artery ostium by 8 months.
Plump et al. (1992) independently found the same in apoE-deficient mice
created by homologous recombination in ES cells. The findings in the
mouse model are comparable to those in 3 human kindreds with inherited
apoE deficiency (Ghiselli et al., 1981; Mabuchi et al., 1989; Kurosaka
et al., 1991). Commenting on the articles of Plump et al. (1992) and
Zhang et al. (1992), Brown and Goldstein (1992) pointed out that
molecular genetics has given us the opportunity to satisfy Koch's
postulates for multifactorial metabolic diseases. Further use of the
apoE gene-targeted mice was made by Linton et al. (1995), who showed
that the severe hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis in these mice could
be prevented by bone marrow transplantation. Although the majority of
apoE in plasma is of hepatic origin, the protein is synthesized by a
variety of cell types, including macrophages. Because macrophages derive
from hematopoietic cells, bone marrow transplantation seemed a possible
therapeutic approach. ApoE-deficient mice given transplants of normal
bone marrow showed apoE in the serum and a normalization of serum
cholesterol levels. Furthermore, they showed virtually complete
protection from diet-induced atherosclerosis.

To unravel the metabolic relationship between apoE and apoC1 in vivo,
van Ree et al. (1995) generated mice deficient in both apolipoproteins.
This enabled subsequent production of transgenic mice with variable
ratios of normal and mutant apoE and apoC1 on a null background. They
found that double inactivation of the ApoE and ApoC1 (107710) loci in
mice, as well as single inactivations at either one of these loci, also
affected the levels of RNA expression of other members of the Apoe-c1-c2
cluster. Homozygous Apoe-c1 knockout mice were hypercholesterolemic and,
with serum cholesterol levels more than 4 times the control value,
resembled mice solely deficient in apoE.

Kashyap et al. (1995) noted that apolipoprotein E-deficient mice,
generated using homologous recombination for targeted gene disruption in
embryonic stem cells, developed marked hyperlipidemia as well as
atherosclerosis. Kashyap et al. (1995) found that intravenous infusion
of a recombinant adenovirus containing the human APOE gene resulted in
normalization of the lipid and lipoprotein profile with markedly
decreased total cholesterol, VLDL, IDL, and LDL, as well as increased
HDL. A marked reduction in the extent of aortic atherosclerosis was
observed after one month.

Plump et al. (1992) and Zhang et al. (1992) created apoE-deficient mice
by gene targeting in embryonic stem cells. These mice displayed severe
hypercholesterolemia even on a low-fat, low cholesterol diet. A key
regulator of cholesterol-rich lipoprotein metabolism, apoE, is
synthesized by numerous extrahepatic tissues. It is synthesized, for
example, in macrophages. To assess the contribution of
macrophage-derived apoE to hepatic clearance of serum cholesterol,
Boisvert et al. (1995) performed bone marrow transplantation on
hypercholesterolemic apoE-deficient 'knockout' mice. Serum cholesterol
levels dropped dramatically in the bone marrow-treated mice largely due
to a reduction in VLDL cholesterol. The extent of atherosclerosis in the
treated mice was also greatly reduced. Wildtype apoE mRNA was detected
in the liver, spleen, and brain of the treated mice indicating that gene
transfer was successfully achieved through bone marrow transplantation.
Masliah et al. (1995) observed an age-dependent loss of
synaptophysin-immunoreactive nerve terminals and microtubule-associated
protein 2-immunoreactive dendrites in the neocortex and hippocampus of
apoE-deficient (knockout) mice. They suggested that apoE may play a role
in maintaining the stability of the synapto-dendritic apparatus.

Sullivan et al. (1997) found that when the mouse apolipoprotein E gene
was replaced by the human APOE3 gene in transgenic mice, diet-induced
hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis were considerably enhanced.

To assess the effects of human APOE isoforms on deposition of
amyloid-beta protein in vivo, Holtzman et al. (1999) bred apoE3 and
apoE4 hemizygous (+/-) transgenic mice expressing human APOE by
astrocytes to mice homozygous (+/+) for a mutant amyloid precursor
protein, V717F (104760.0003), transgene that developed age-dependent
Alzheimer disease neuropathology. All mice had a mouse apoE null (-/-)
background. By 9 months of age, the mice heterozygous for the human
V717F mutant had developed deposition of amyloid-beta protein, but the
quantity of amyloid-beta deposits was significantly less than that seen
in heterozygous mice expressing mouse apoE. In contrast to effects of
mouse apoE, similar levels of human apoE3 and apoE4 markedly suppressed
early amyloid-beta deposition at 9 months of age in the V717F
heterozygous transgenic mice, even when compared with mice lacking apoE.
These findings suggested that human APOE isoforms decrease amyloid-beta
aggregation or increase amyloid-beta clearance relative to an
environment in which mouse apoE or no apoE is present.

To determine the effect of APOE on deposition of amyloid-beta and
Alzheimer disease pathology, Holtzman et al. (2000) compared APP(V717F)
transgenic mice expressing mouse, human, or no APOE. A severe,
plaque-associated neuritic dystrophy developed in the transgenic mice
expressing mouse or human APOE. Although significant levels of
amyloid-beta deposition also occurred in APP(V717F) transgenics that
completely lacked APOE, neuritic degeneration was virtually absent.
Expression of APOE3 and APOE4 in APP(V717F) transgenics who had knockout
of APOE resulted in fibrillar amyloid-beta deposits and neuritic plaques
by 15 months of age, and more than 10-fold more fibrillar deposits were
observed in APOE4-expressing APP(V717F) transgenic mice. The data
demonstrated a critical and isoform-specific role for APOE in neuritic
plaque formation, a pathologic hallmark of Alzheimer disease.

Raber et al. (2000) tested the spatial memory of transgenic mice
carrying human forms of amyloid precursor protein and either apoE3 or
apoE4 and found that it was impaired in mice with apoE4 but not in those
with apoE3, even though the levels of beta-amyloid in their brains were
comparable. As no plaques were detectable in APP and APP/apoE mice at 6
months of age, Raber et al. (2000) concluded that the differential
effects of apoE isoforms on human amyloid precursor protein/amyloid
beta-induced cognitive impairments are independent of plaque formation.
Learning deficits were more significant in female than in male mice.
These sex-dependent differences may relate to the increased
susceptibility of women to APOE4-associated cognitive deficits.

Mitchell et al. (2000) investigated the therapeutic efficacy of liver
repopulation in ApoE knockout mice. Knockout mice were transplanted with
Fas/CD95-resistant hepatocytes, which constitutively express ApoE, and
were subsequently submitted to weekly injections of nonlethal doses of
the Fas agonist antibody Jo2. After 8 weeks of treatment, mice exhibited
up to 30% of the normal level of plasma ApoE. ApoE secretion was
accompanied by a drastic and significant decrease in total plasma
cholesterol and a markedly reduced progression of atherosclerosis.

Mice homozygous for human APOE2 (107741.0001), regardless of age or
gender, develop type III hyperlipoproteinemia (HLP; 606945.0001),
whereas homozygosity for APOE2 results in HLP in no more than 10% of
humans, predominantly in adult males. By generating mice homozygous for
human APOE2 and heterozygous for human LDLR and mouse Ldlr, Knouff et
al. (2001) detected increased stability of mRNA in liver associated with
a truncation of the 3-prime-UTR of LDLR. Plasma lipoprotein levels were
normal in the LDLR heterozygotes. Knouff et al. (2001) concluded that
moderate and controlled overexpression of the LDLR completely
ameliorates the type III HLP phenotype of APOE2 homozygous mice.

Tangirala et al. (2001) determined that human APOE3 expressed in
Ldlr-null mice accumulated in artery walls. Expression induced
significant regression of advanced pre-existing atherosclerotic lesions.
Regression of lesions was accompanied by the loss of macrophage-derived
foam cells and a trend toward increased extracellular matrix of lesions,
but there was no change in plasma total cholesterol levels or
lipoprotein composition. APOE also had antioxidant properties as
measured by reduced levels of isoprostanes in urine, LDLs, and artery
walls.

Lesuisse et al. (2001) investigated whether increased expression of apoE
can, in a dominant fashion, influence amyloid deposition. They expressed
human apoE4 via the mouse prion protein promoter, resulting in high
expression in both astrocytes and neurons; only astrocytes efficiently
secreted human apoE4 (at least 5-fold more than endogenous). Mice
hyperexpressing human apoE4 developed normally and lived normal life
spans. The coexpression of human apoE4 with a mutant APP or mutant APP
and mutant presenilin did not lead to proportional changes in the age of
appearance, relative burden, character, or distribution of amyloid-beta
deposits. The authors concluded that the mechanisms by which apoE
influences amyloid-beta deposition may involve an aspect of its normal
function that is not augmented by hyperexpression.

Yamauchi et al. (2003) crossed ApoE-deficient mice with mice carrying a
transgene for the globular domain of adiponectin (605441). When
expressed on the ApoE-deficient background, the globular domain of
adiponectin reduced the atherosclerotic lesions even though plasma
glucose and lipid levels remained the same. The protection from
atherosclerosis was associated with decreased expression of class A
scavenger receptor (see 153622) and tumor necrosis factor alpha
(191160).

Chen et al. (2001) determined that ApoE is expressed in mouse kidneys,
specifically in the mesangial cells and at lower levels in glomerular
epithelial cells. They found that ApoE-null mice showed increased
mesangial cell proliferation and matrix formation compared with wildtype
mice. ApoE-null mice also had reduced levels of perlecan (142461), the
major heparin sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) of the mesangial matrix. The
addition of ApoE3 to isolated mouse mesangial cells in culture
completely blocked mesangial cell proliferation stimulated by serum,
PDGF (190040), or LDL. ApoE3 also induced HSPG formation and inhibited
mesangial cell apoptosis induced by oxidized LDL. ApoE2 and ApoE4 were
less effective.

To study lipoprotein metabolism, Magoori et al. (2003) generated mice
lacking both apoE and Lrp5 (603506). On a normal diet, the double
knockout mice older than 4 months of age had 60% higher plasma
cholesterol levels than the levels observed with apoE deficiency alone.
LRP5 deficiency alone had no significant effects on the plasma
cholesterol levels. Analysis showed that the VLDL and low LDL fractions
were markedly increased in the double knockout mice. Atherosclerotic
lesions in the double knockout mice at age 6 months were severe, with
destruction of the internal elastic lamina.

Huang et al. (2001) found that apoE undergoes proteolytic cleavage in AD
brains and in cultured neuronal cells, resulting in the accumulation of
C-terminal-truncated fragments of apoE that are neurotoxic. Harris et
al. (2003) showed that this fragmentation is caused by proteolysis of
apoE by a chymotrypsin-like serine protease that cleaves apoE4 more
efficiently than apoE3. They found that transgenic mice expressing the
C-terminal-cleaved product, apoE4 (del272-299), at high levels in the
brain died at 2 to 4 months of age. The cortex and hippocampus of these
mice displayed AD-like neurodegenerative alterations, including
abnormally phosphorylated tau and silver-positive neurons that contained
cytosolic straight filaments with diameters of 15 to 20 nm, resembling
preneurofibrillary tangles. Transgenic mice expressing lower levels of
the truncated apoE4 survived longer but showed impaired learning and
memory at 6 to 7 months of age. Thus, C-terminal-truncated fragments of
apoE4, which occur in AD brains, are sufficient to elicit AD-like
neurodegeneration and behavioral deficits in vivo. Harris et al. (2003)
concluded that inhibiting their formation might inhibit apoE4-associated
neuronal deficits. Using various truncation and mutant constructs, Chang
et al. (2005) demonstrated that the neurotoxicity associated with ApoE4
fragments was mediated by both the lipid-binding region, spanning amino
acids 241-272, and the receptor-binding region, spanning amino acids
135-150, which caused mitochondrial dysfunction and neurotoxicity.

Lund et al. (2004) found aberrant DNA methylation patterns prior to the
onset of atherosclerosis in Apoe null mice. Both hyper- and
hypomethylation were found in aortas and peripheral blood mononuclear
cells of 4-week-old mutant mice with no detectable atherosclerotic
lesions. Sequencing and expression analysis of 60 leukocyte
polymorphisms revealed that epigenetic changes involved transcribed
genes as well as repeated interspersed elements. Furthermore, Lund et
al. (2004) showed that atherogenic lipoproteins promoted global DNA
hypermethylation in a human monocyte cell line.

Ricci et al. (2004) showed that atherosclerosis-prone ApoE-null mice
simultaneously lacking Jnk2 (602896) (ApoE -/- Jnk2 -/- mice), but not
ApoE -/- Jnk1 (601158) -/- mice, developed less atherosclerosis than do
ApoE-null mice. Pharmacologic inhibition of Jnk activity efficiently
reduced plaque formation. Macrophages lacking Jnk2 displayed suppressed
foam cell formation caused by defective uptake and degradation of
modified lipoproteins and showed increased amounts of the modified
lipoprotein-binding and -internalizing scavenger receptor A (see
153622), whose phosphorylation was markedly decreased.
Macrophage-restricted deletion of Jnk2 was sufficient to decrease
atherogenesis. Thus, Ricci et al. (2004) concluded that JNK2-dependent
phosphorylation of SRA promotes uptake of lipids in macrophages, thereby
regulating foam cell formation, a critical step in atherogenesis.

DeMattos et al. (2004) generated transgenic mice with a mutation in the
amyloid precursor protein (APP) (V717F; 104760.0003) that were also null
for apoE, apoJ (185430), or null for both apo genes. The double apo
knockout mice showed early-onset beta-amyloid deposition beginning at 6
months of age and a marked increase in amyloid deposition compared to
the other mice. The amyloid plaques were compact and diffuse, were
thioflavine S-positive (indicating true fibrillar amyloid), and were
distributed throughout the hippocampus and some parts of the cortex,
contributing to neuritic plaques. The findings suggested that apoE and
apoJ are not required for amyloid fibril formation. The double apo
knockout mice also had increased levels of intracellular soluble
beta-amyloid compared to the other mice. Insoluble beta-42 was similar
to the apoE-null mice, suggesting that ApoE has a selective effect on
beta-42. As APP is produced and secreted by neurons in the CNS and apoE
and clusterin are produced and secreted primarily by astrocytes in the
CNS, the interaction between the apolipoproteins and beta-amyloid occurs
in the interstitial fluid of the brain, an extracellular compartment
that is continuous with the CSF. DeMattos et al. (2004) found that
apoE-null and apoE/apoJ-null mice had increased levels of beta-amyloid
in the CSF and interstitial space, suggesting that apoE, and perhaps
apoJ, play a role in regulating extracellular CNS beta-amyloid clearance
independent of beta-amyloid synthesis. The data suggested that, in the
mouse, apoE and apoJ cooperatively suppress beta-amyloid deposition.

Steffens et al. (2005) investigated the effects of
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in a mouse model of established
atherosclerosis. Oral administration of THC (1 mg/kg(-1) per day)
resulted in significant inhibition of disease progression. This
effective dose is lower than the dose usually associated with
psychotropic effects of THC. Furthermore, Steffens et al. (2005)
detected CB2 receptor (605051) (the main cannabinoid receptor expressed
on immune cells) in both human and mouse atherosclerotic plaques.
Lymphoid cells isolated from THC-treated mice showed diminished
proliferation capacity and decreased interferon-gamma (147570)
secretion. Macrophage chemotaxis, which is a crucial step for the
development of atherosclerosis, was also inhibited in vitro by THC. All
these effects were completely blocked by a specific CB2 receptor
antagonist. Steffens et al. (2005) concluded that oral treatment with a
low dose of THC inhibited atherosclerosis progression in the
apolipoprotein E knockout mouse model, through pleiotropic
immunomodulatory effects on lymphoid and myeloid cells, and that THC or
cannabinoids with activity at the CB2 receptor may be valuable targets
for treating atherosclerosis.

In cultured rat neuroblastoma cells, Ye et al. (2005) found that
lipid-poor Apoe4 increased beta-amyloid production to a greater extent
than lipid-poor Apoe3 due to more pronounced stimulation of APP
recycling by Apoe4 compared to Apoe3. The difference in beta-amyloid
production was abolished by blocking the LDL receptor (606945) protein
pathway. The findings indicated that there are isoform-specific effects
of ApoE on beta-amyloid production.

Dodart et al. (2005) generated mice carrying the APP V717F mutation
(104760.0003) and found that intracerebral hippocampal delivery of the
human ApoE E4 gene in V717F-mutant mice that lacked mouse Apoe resulted
in increased beta-amyloid deposition compared to similar mice that
received human ApoE E3 or E4. In V717F-mutant mice expressing mouse
Apoe, administration of human ApoE E4 did not result in increased
beta-amyloid burden, and administration of human ApoE E2 resulted in
decreased beta-amyloid burden, reflecting the dominant effect of the
human E2 isoform. Dodart et al. (2005) noted that the findings were
consistent with ApoE isoform-dependent human neuropathologic findings.
However, the lentiviral vectors used to deliver ApoE isoforms appeared
to result in a loss of hippocampal granule neurons, suggesting a
neurotoxic effect.

Malek et al. (2005) described a mouse model that combined 3 known ARMD
(603075) risk factors: advanced age, high fat cholesterol-rich (HF-C)
diet, and apoE genotype. Eyes of aged, targeted replacement mice
expressing human apoE2, apoE3, or apoE4 and maintained on an HF-C diet
showed apoE isoform-dependent pathologies of differential severity:
apoE4 mice were the most severely affected. They developed a
constellation of changes that mimicked the pathology associated with
human ARMD. These alterations included diffuse subretinal pigment
epithelial deposits, drusenoid deposits, thickened Bruch membrane, and
atrophy, hypopigmentation, and hyperpigmentation of the retinal pigment
epithelium. In extreme cases, apoE4 mice also developed choroidal
neovascularization, a hallmark of exudative ARMD. Neither age nor HF-C
diet alone was sufficient to elicit these changes. The findings
implicated the human apoE4 allele as a susceptibility gene for ARMD.

Seitz et al. (2005) reported that, in addition to the transcript (ApoE
S1) that translates into ApoE, there are 3 additional transcripts in
mice. Two of these transcripts, ApoE S2 and ApoE S3, which are predicted
to be transmembrane proteins, were transcribed from the sense strand.
ApoE AS1 was transcribed from the antisense strand and was complementary
to exon 4 of ApoE S1. The antisense transcript fell within the region of
the human APOE*E4 allele that has been linked to the familial onset form
of Alzheimer disease. Although ApoE S3 and ApoE AS1 were transcribed in
ApoE-knockout mice, ApoE S1 and ApoE S2 were not transcribed. In spinal
cord-injured C57BL/6 mice, both ApoE S1 and ApoE S3 transcripts were
upregulated 10-fold, and the antisense ApoE AS1 was upregulated 100-fold
compared with normal levels. Seitz et al. (2005) suggested that these
alternate transcripts may be involved in the molecular pathogenesis of
CNS disease and perhaps in ApoE expression in general, since ApoE S2 and
AS1 are also transcribed in humans.

In mouse hybrid cells and cultured rat hippocampal cells in vitro, Wang
et al. (2006) found that ApoE expression was differentially regulated by
estrogen receptor (ESR)-alpha (ESR1; 133430) and ESR-beta (ESR2;
601663). Pharmacologic activation of ESR1 significantly upregulated ApoE
mRNA and protein expression, whereas ESR2 activation resulted in
significant downregulation. Similar results were observed in the
hippocampus of ovariectomized rats in vivo.

Using different Apoe transgenic mice, including mice with ablation
and/or inhibition of cyclophilin A (CypA; 123840), Bell et al. (2012)
showed that expression of Apoe4 and lack of murine Apoe, but not Apoe2
and Apoe3, leads to blood-brain barrier breakdown by activating a
proinflammatory CypA-Nfkb (164011)-Mmp9 (120361) pathway in pericytes.
This, in turn, leads to neuronal uptake of multiple blood-derived
neurotoxic proteins, and microvascular and cerebral blood flow
reductions. Bell et al. (2012) showed that the vascular defects in
Apoe-deficient and Apoe4-expressing mice precede neuronal dysfunction
and can initiate neurodegenerative changes. Astrocyte-secreted Apoe3,
but not Apoe4, suppressed the CypA-Nfkb-Mmp9 pathway in pericytes
through a lipoprotein receptor. Bell et al. (2012) concluded that CypA
is a key target for treating APOE4-mediated neurovascular injury and the
resulting neuronal dysfunction and degeneration.

Dutta et al. (2012) showed that after myocardial infarction or stroke,
Apoe-null mice developed larger atherosclerotic lesions with a more
advanced morphology. This disease acceleration persisted over many weeks
and was associated with markedly increased monocyte recruitment. Seeking
the source of surplus monocytes in plaques, Dutta et al. (2012) found
that myocardial infarction liberated hematopoietic stem and progenitor
cells from bone marrow niches via sympathetic nervous system signaling.
The progenitors then seeded the spleen, yielding a sustained boost in
monocyte production.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
APOE2 ISOFORMS
HYPERLIPOPROTEINEMIA, TYPE III, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
APOE, ARG158CYS

Apolipoprotein E2 exists in 2 main isoforms, arg158 and cys158 (Rall et
al., 1982; Gill et al., 1985). The second isoform (arg158-to-cys) was
found in 98 of 100 E2 alleles by Emi et al. (1988). The other isoforms
that give a band at the E2 position with isoelectric focusing include
E2(lys146-to-gln) and E2(arg145-to-cys). Type III hyperlipoproteinemia
is typically associated with homozygosity for a change in apolipoprotein
E2 from arg158 to cys.

By generating mice with a human APOE*2 allele in place of the mouse Apoe
gene via targeted gene replacement in embryonic stem cells, Sullivan et
al. (1998) demonstrated that a single amino acid difference (arg158 to
cys) in the APOE protein is sufficient to cause type III
hyperlipoproteinemia and spontaneous atherosclerosis in mice. Mice
expressing human APOE2 (2/2) had virtually all the characteristics of
type III hyperlipoproteinemia. Both their plasma cholesterol and
triglyceride levels were 2 to 3 times those in normolipidemic mice that
expressed human APOE3 (3/3) generated in an identical manner. The 2/2
mice were markedly defective in clearing beta-migrating VLDL particles
and spontaneously developed atherosclerotic plaques, even on a regular
diet. An atherogenic diet, high in fat and cholesterol, exacerbated
development of atherosclerosis and xanthomas in the 2/2 mice.

In 72 patients with type III hyperlipidemia and the APOE 2/2 genotype,
Evans et al. (2005) found a significantly higher frequency for at least
1 minor allele of the APOA5 -1131T-C and S19W (606368.0002) SNPs in
patients than in controls (53% vs 19.7%, respectively; p = 0.0001).
Evans et al. (2005) concluded that genetic variation in the APOA5 gene
is an important cofactor in the development of type III hyperlipidemia.

.0002
HYPERLIPOPROTEINEMIA AND ATHEROSCLEROSIS ASSOCIATED WITH APOE5
APOE, GLU3LYS

This change was identified in Japanese by Tajima et al. (1988). Using
isoelectric focusing with immunoblotting in the study of blood specimens
from 1,269 Japanese subjects, Matsunaga et al. (1995) found that the
epsilon-5 allele had a frequency of 0.001.

.0003
HYPERLIPOPROTEINEMIA, TYPE III, DUE TO APOE2-CHRISTCHURCH
APOE, ARG136SER

This variant was described by Wardell et al. (1987) and Emi et al.
(1988). Wardell et al. (1987) studied the primary structure of apoE in 7
type III hyperlipoproteinemic patients with the apoE2/E2 phenotype. Six
of the patients had identical 2-dimensional tryptic peptide maps; these
differed from the normal by the altered mobility of a single peptide.
Amino acid analysis and sequencing showed that these patients had the
most common form of apoE2 (158 arg-to-cys). The seventh patient had a
unique peptide map with the new peptide resulting from a substitution of
136 arginine-to-serine. He was heterozygous for this and for the common
158 arg mutation; thus, he was a genetic compound.

.0004
HYPERLIPOPROTEINEMIA, TYPE III, ASSOCIATED WITH APOE2
FAMILIAL DYSBETALIPOPROTEINEMIA
APOE, ARG145CYS

This variant was described by Rall et al. (1982) and Emi et al. (1988).
Rall et al. (1982) demonstrated heterogeneity in type III
hyperlipoproteinemia. They studied 3 subjects who were phenotypically
homozygous for apoE2 but showed considerable differences in the binding
activity to the fibroblast receptor. The subject with the poorest
binding apoE2 was genotypically homozygous for an apoE allele (epsilon
2); cysteine was found at sites A and B. The subject with the most
actively binding apoE2 was genotypically homozygous for an apoE allele
(epsilon 2*); cysteine was found at site A and at a new site, site C,
residue 145, which in apoE2 has arginine. Epsilon 2*, furthermore,
specifies a protein with arginine at site B (residue 158). The third
subject, whose apoE2 displayed binding activity intermediate between the
activities of the other 2, was genotypically heterozygous, having 1
epsilon 2 allele and 1 epsilon 2* allele.

.0005
HYPERLIPOPROTEINEMIA, TYPE III, ASSOCIATED WITH APOE DEFICIENCY
APOE, IVS3AS, A-G, -1

Cladaras et al. (1987) showed that one form of familial apoE deficiency
results from a point mutation in the 3-prime splice junction of the
third intron of the APOE gene. The change, an A-to-G substitution in the
penultimate 3-prime nucleotide of the third intron, abolished the
correct 3-prime splice site, thus creating 2 abnormally spliced mRNA
forms. Both mRNAs contain chain termination codons within the intronic
sequence. The clinical features of the patient were described by
Ghiselli et al. (1981) and Schaefer et al. (1986).

.0006
HYPERLIPOPROTEINEMIA, TYPE III, ASSOCIATED WITH APOE LEIDEN
APOE, 21-BP INS, DUP CODONS 121-127

Havekes et al. (1986) found type III hyperlipoproteinemia (HLP) in a
dominant pedigree pattern in a family with a variant of E3 they called
E3(Leiden). By isoelectric focusing, the affected persons appeared to be
homozygous for normal apoE3, but the variant E3 showed defective binding
to LDL receptor, and on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis showed mobility intermediate to those of normal E3 and
normal E2. The mother and 5 of 8 sibs had type III HLP; 4 of the 5 had
xanthomatosis. The affected persons were heterozygotes E3/E3(Leiden).
Wardell et al. (1989) demonstrated a 7-amino acid insertion that is a
tandem repeat of residues 121-127. In a screening of patients with
familial dysbetalipoproteinemia, de Knijff et al. (1991) found 5
probands showing heterozygosity for the APOE*3-Leiden allele.
Genealogical studies revealed that these probands shared common ancestry
in the 17th century. In 1 large kindred spanning 3 generations, 37
additional heterozygotes were detected. Although severity varied, all
carriers showed characteristics of dysbetalipoproteinemia such as: (a)
elevated levels of cholesterol in VLDL and IDL fractions; (b) elevated
ratios of cholesterol levels in these density fractions over total
plasma levels of triglycerides; and (c) strongly increased plasma levels
of apoE. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that most of the
variability in expression of familial dysbetalipoproteinemia in
APOE*3-Leiden allele carriers can be explained by age.

In a discussion of mouse models of atherosclerosis, Breslow (1996)
referred to the development of a transgenic mouse carrying the
APOE-Leiden mutation. When fed a very high cholesterol diet containing
cholic acid, these mice had cholesterol levels of 1,600 to 2,000 mg/dl
and developed fatty streak and fibrous plaque lesions.

.0007
HYPERLIPOPROTEINEMIA, TYPE III, ASSOCIATED WITH APOE7
APOE-SUITA
APOE, GLU244LYS AND GLU245LYS

Maeda et al. (1989) and Tajima et al. (1989) found that 2 contiguous
glutamic acid residues, glu244 and glu245, are changed to lysine
residues, lys244 and lys245. This involved a change from GAC-GAG to
AAC-AAG. Using isoelectric focusing with immunoblotting in the study of
blood specimens from 1,269 Japanese subjects, Matsunaga et al. (1995)
found that the epsilon-7 allele had a frequency of 0.007.

.0008
HYPERLIPOPROTEINEMIA, TYPE III, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
FAMILIAL DYSBETALIPOPROTEINEMIA
APOE, CYS112ARG AND ARG142CYS

In a family reported by Havel et al. (1983), Rall et al. (1989) found
that the members with type III hyperlipoproteinemia (HLP) were compound
heterozygotes for 2 different APOE alleles, one coding for the normal
APOE3 and one for a previously undescribed variant APOE3 with 2 changes:
arginine replacing cysteine at residue 112 and cysteine replacing
arginine at residue 142. The variant APOE3 was defective in its ability
to bind to lipoprotein receptors, a functional defect probably
contributing to expression of type III HLP in this kindred. Type III HLP
typically is associated with homozygosity for apolipoprotein E2
(arg158-to-cys); see 107741.0001. Dominant expression of type III HLP
associated with apoE phenotype E3/3 is caused by heterozygosity for a
common apoE variant, apoE3 (cys112-to-arg; arg142-to-cys). To determine
the functional characteristics of the variant protein, Horie et al.
(1992) used recombinant DNA techniques to produce the variant in
bacteria. They also produced a non-naturally occurring variant,
apoE(arg142cys), that had only the cysteine substituted at residue 142.
They demonstrated that the cys142 variant was responsible for the
defective binding to lipoprotein receptors because both showed the same
defect. The arg112,cys142 variant predominates 3:1 over normal apoE3 in
the very low density lipoproteins of plasma from an affected subject.
Horie et al. (1992) concluded that unique properties of the
arg112,cys142 variant provided an explanation for its association with
dominant expression of type III HLP.

.0009
APOLIPOPROTEINEMIA E1
APOE, GLY127ASP AND ARG148CYS

Weisgraber et al. (1984) found an electrophoretic variant of apoE in a
Finnish hypertriglyceridemic subject. The variant was designated E1
(gly127-to-asp, arg148-to-cys). Family studies showed 'vertical
transmission.' The relation of E1 to hypertriglyceridemia was unclear.

.0010
HYPERLIPOPROTEINEMIA, TYPE III, DUE TO APOE1-HARRISBURG
APOE, LYS146GLU

Mann et al. (1989) described this mutation as the basis of familial
dysbetalipoproteinemia.

The mutation led to the dominant expression of type III
hyperlipoproteinemia in all 5 affected patients heterozygous for the
mutant allele in this family. A second family with type III
hyperlipoproteinemia due to the identical mutation was reported by
Moriyama et al. (1992). Mann et al. (1995) determined the structural
defect in the ApoE-1 molecule resulting from this mutation and studied
its functional implications using in vivo kinetic studies in the
original proband and in normal subjects, and using in vitro binding
assays with human fibroblasts and the proteoglycan heparin. They
concluded that the functional dominance of the mutation resulted from
the abnormal in vitro binding characteristics and the altered in vivo
metabolism of the mutant protein.

.0011
DYSBETALIPOPROTEINEMIA DUE TO APOE2
APOE, LYS146GLN

As in APOE1-Harrisburg, a mutation at position 146 leads to
dysbetalipoproteinemia, suggesting that this residue plays a crucial
role in removal of chylomicrons and VLDL in vivo. In the Netherlands,
Smit et al. (1990) found that all 40 patients with familial
dyslipoproteinemia and the E2E2 phenotype were homozygous for the
E2(arg158-to-cys) mutation. On the other hand, all 3 unrelated patients
with the E3E2 phenotype showed the rare E2(lys146-to-gln) mutation due
to an A-to-C substitution at nucleotide 3847 of the APOE gene. This
mutation was not found in 13 normolipidemic persons with the E2E2
phenotype or 120 with the E3E2 phenotype selected from a random
population sample. Family studies showed predisposition to type III
hyperlipoproteinemia with high penetrance. Thus, this is a highly
penetrant dominant form of the disease; E2(arg158-to-cys) is a low
penetrant, recessive form. Dominant inheritance has been observed also
with E1(Harrisburg), E3(Leiden), and E3(cys112-to-arg; arg142-to-cys).
Some of the reduced penetrance of the E2 allele in causing familial
dysbetalipoproteinemia is based on the fact that all E2 as phenotyped by
isoelectric focusing is not genetically a single entity.

.0012
APOE2-DUNEDIN
APOE, ARG228CYS

In identical twin brothers with the E2/2 phenotype but with type IV/V
hyperlipoproteinemia, Wardell et al. (1990) found compound
heterozygosity for the arg158-to-cys mutation and a second unusual
mutation representing a substitution of cysteine for arginine at
position 228.

.0013
HYPERLIPOPROTEINEMIA, TYPE III, DUE TO APOE4-PHILADELPHIA
APOE, GLU13LYS AND ARG145CYS

In a 24-year-old white female with severe type III hyperlipoproteinemia
(HLP), Lohse et al. (1991) found 2 rare point mutations. One was a
C-to-T mutation which converted arginine (CGT) at position 145 of the
mature protein to cysteine (TGT), thus creating the APOE-2* variant
(107741.0004). A second G-to-A substitution at amino acid 13 led to the
exchange of lysine (AAG) for glutamic acid (GAG), thereby adding 2
positive charge units to the protein and producing the APOE-5 variant.
Both mutations resulted in loss of restriction enzyme cleavage sites.
The proband was homozygous for both mutations. Lohse et al. (1992)
extended their analyses to include 9 additional family members of the
Philadelphia kindred spanning 4 generations. DNA and protein analysis
demonstrated that the originally described proposita, called by them
propositus, was a true homozygote for the apolipoprotein
E4(Philadelphia) allele and that 6 of the 9 family members were
heterozygous for the mutant allele and the normal E3 allele or, in 1
case, the E4 allele. Heterozygosity led to the expression of a moderate
form of type III HLP without clinical manifestations. The simultaneous
presence of unaffected persons, heterozygotes, and a homozygote makes it
possible to conclude that the mutation shows incomplete dominance.

.0014
HYPERLIPOPROTEINEMIA, TYPE III, ASSOCIATED WITH APOE DEFICIENCY
APOE3-WASHINGTON
APOE, TRP210TER

Lohse et al. (1992) studied a kindred with apolipoprotein E deficiency
and a truncated low molecular weight apoE mutant, designated
apoE-3(Washington). Gel electrophoresis demonstrated complete absence of
the normal apoE isoproteins and the presence of a small quantity of a
lower molecular weight apoE. Plasma apoE levels in the proband were
approximately 4% of normal. This marked deficiency of apoE resulted in
delayed uptake of chylomicron and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)
remnants by the liver, elevated plasma cholesterol levels, mild
hypertriglyceridemia, and the development of type III
hyperlipoproteinemia. Sequence analysis demonstrated a G-to-A transition
which converted amino acid 210 of the mature protein, tryptophan (TGG),
to a premature chain termination codon (TAG), thus leading to the
synthesis of a truncated E apolipoprotein of 209 amino acids with a
molecular mass of 23.88 kD. The nucleotide substitution also resulted in
the formation of a new restriction site for MaeI. Using this enzyme,
they were able to establish that the proband was a homozygote and that
her 2 offspring were heterozygotes. They stated that only a single
kindred with apoE deficiency had been reported previously. This was the
kindred reported by Ghiselli et al. (1981) and elucidated at the
molecular level by Cladaras et al. (1987); see 107741.0005.

.0015
APOE3 ISOFORM
APOE, CYS112 AND ARG158

Weisgraber et al. (1981) and Rall et al. (1982) identified one of the 3
major apolipoprotein E isoforms, apolipoprotein E3. The variant has
cys112 and arg158. This is the most common variant, with frequencies of
40% to 90% in various populations.

.0016
ALZHEIMER DISEASE 2, DUE TO APOE4 ISOFORM
APOE, CYS112ARG

Weisgraber et al. (1981), Das et al. (1985), and Paik et al. (1985)
identified the apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4) isoform, in which there is a
cys112-to-arg (C112R) substitution. This variant is found in 6 to 37% of
individuals from different populations. Individuals carrying the
apolipoprotein E4 allele display low levels of apolipoprotein E and high
levels of plasma cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol,
apolipoprotein B, lipoprotein (a), and are at higher risk for coronary
artery disease than other individuals.

Saunders et al. (1993) reported an increased frequency of the E4 allele
in a small prospective series of possible-probable AD patients
presenting to the memory disorders clinic at Duke University, in
comparison with spouse controls. Corder et al. (1993) found that the
APOE*E4 allele is associated with the late-onset familial and sporadic
forms of Alzheimer disease. In 42 families with the late-onset form of
Alzheimer disease (AD2; 104310), the gene had been mapped to the same
region of chromosome 19 as the APOE gene. Corder et al. (1993) found
that the risk for AD increased from 20 to 90% and mean age of onset
decreased from 84 to 68 years with increasing number of APOE*E4 alleles.
Homozygosity for APOE*E4 was virtually sufficient to cause AD by age 80.

Myers et al. (1996) examined the association of apolipoprotein E4 with
Alzheimer disease and other dementias in 1,030 elderly individuals in
the Framingham Study cohort. They found an increased risk for Alzheimer
disease as well as other dementias in patients who were homozygous or
heterozygous for E4. However they pointed out that most apoE4 carriers
do not develop dementia and about one-half of Alzheimer disease is not
associated with apoE4.

Tang et al. (1996) compared relative risks by APOE genotypes in a
collection of cases and controls from 3 ethnic groups in a New York
community. The relative risk for Alzheimer disease associated with APOE4
homozygosity was increased in all ethnic groups: African American RR =
3.0; Caucasian RR = 7.3; and Hispanic RR = 2.5 (compared with the RR
with APOE3 homozygosity). The risk was also increased for APOE4
heterozygous Caucasians and Hispanics, but not for African Americans.
The age distribution of the proportion of Caucasian and Hispanics
without AD was consistently lower for APOE4 homozygous and APOE4
heterozygous individuals than for those with other APOE genotypes. In
African Americans this relationship was observed only in APOE4
homozygotes. Differences in risk among APOE4 heterozygous African
Americans suggested to the authors that other genetic or environmental
factors may modify the effect of APOE4 in some populations.

In a longitudinal study of 55 patients with Alzheimer disease, Mori et
al. (2002) determined that the rate of hippocampal atrophy was
significantly greater in those with an APOE4 allele, and that the rate
became more severe as the number of E4 alleles increased. However, their
data did not support the findings of previous studies that the E4 allele
is associated with an increased rate of cognitive decline.

In a cohort of 180 asymptomatic individuals with a mean age of 60 years,
Caselli et al. (2004) found that carriers of an E4 allele showed greater
declines in memory performance over a median period of 33 months
compared to those without an E4 allele. Among 494 individuals with mild
cognitive impairment, Farlow et al. (2004) found an association between
the E4 allele and worse scores on cognition tests as well as smaller
total hippocampal volume. Among 6,202 Caucasian middle-aged individuals
(47 to 68 years), Blair et al. (2005) found that carriers of the E4
allele had greater cognitive decline over a 6-year period compared to
those without an E4 allele. Results for 1,693 African American patients
were inconclusive.

Enzinger et al. (2004) noted that decreases in brain size and volume in
patients with multiple sclerosis (126200) are related to neuroaxonal
injury and loss, and are a useful surrogate marker of tissue damage and
disease progression. In a study of 99 patients with MS, the authors
found that patients who carried an E4 allele had more relapses during
the study period and had a 5-fold higher rate of annual brain volume
loss compared to patients without the E4 allele. Over time, E4 carriers
also had an increase in individual lesions on MRI, termed 'black holes.'
Among all genotype groups, the lowest annual loss of brain volume
occurred in patients with an E2 allele. Among 76 patients with
relapsing-remitting MS, de Stefano et al. (2004) found that carriers of
the E4 allele showed significantly lower total brain volumes compared to
MS patients without the E4 alleles. There was no difference in lesion
volume between the 2 groups. The authors suggested that the E4 allele is
linked to impaired mechanisms of cell repair and severe tissue
destruction in MS.

Among 89 patients with head injury, Teasdale et al. (1997) found that
patients with the E4 allele were more likely than those without the E4
allele to have an unfavorable outcome 6 months after head injury. The
authors discussed the role of the apoE protein in response to acute
brain injury. In a prospective study of 69 patients with severe blunt
trauma to the head, Friedman et al. (1999) found an odds ratio of 5.69
for more than 7 days of unconsciousness and 13.93 for a suboptimal
neurologic outcome at 6 months for individuals with an APOE4 allele
compared to those without that allele.

In 110 patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), Crawford et al.
(2002) tested memory and other cognitive variables and found that
patients with the APOE4 allele had more difficulty with memory than
matched patients without the E4 allele. In those with the E4 allele,
performance was poor regardless of severity of injury, whereas in those
without the E4 allele, performance worsened with more severe injury.
Crawford et al. (2002) noted that TBI may result in greater damage to
the medial temporal lobe structures involved in memory and suggested a
role for the APOE protein in neuronal repair.

In 87 patients with mild to moderate TBI, Liberman et al. (2002) used
neuropsychologic testing to examine whether the APOE4 genotype affected
short-term recovery. At 6 weeks, E4-positive patients had lower mean
scores on 11 of 13 tests, but the differences from the E4-negative group
were smaller than the differences observed at 3 weeks. Although Liberman
et al. (2002) stated that the findings are consistent with delayed
recovery among E4-positive TBI patients, perhaps due to interactions
with beta-amyloid, they cautioned against the generalizability of the
results.

Among 60 patients with TBI with a mean follow-up of 31 years, Koponen et
al. (2004) found that presence of the E4 allele increased the risk for
dementia, but there was no association between the E4 allele and
development of other psychiatric illnesses, including depression,
anxiety, psychosis, or personality disorders.

To pursue mechanisms by which APOE4 affects human brain physiology and
modifies late-onset Alzheimer disease risk, Rhinn et al. (2013) analyzed
whole-transcriptome cerebral cortex gene expression data in unaffected
APOE4 carriers and late-onset Alzheimer disease patients. APOE4 carrier
status was associated with a consistent transcriptomic shift that
broadly resembled the late-onset Alzheimer disease profile. Differential
coexpression correlation network analysis of the APOE4 and late-onset
Alzheimer disease transcriptomic changes identified a set of candidate
core regulatory mediators. Several of these, including APBA2 (602712),
FYN (137025), RNF219, and SV2A (185860), encode modulators of late-onset
Alzheimer disease-associated amyloid beta A4 precursor protein (APP;
104760) endocytosis and metabolism. Furthermore, a genetic variant
within RNF219 was found to affect amyloid deposition in human brain and
late-onset Alzheimer disease age of onset.

HYPERLIPOPROTEINEMIA, TYPE III, ASSOCIATED WITH APOE DEFICIENCY, AUTOSOMAL
RECESSIVE
APOE, 1-BP DEL, 2919G DEL, FS60TER

Feussner et al. (1992) identified in German subjects with autosomal
recessive familial dysbetalipoproteinemia a 1-bp deletion (G) at the
last nucleotide of codon 30 at position 2919 of exon 3 (or the first 2
nucleotides of codon 31 at nucleotide positions 2920 or 2921). This
frameshift mutation (called APOE0) creates a termination at codon 60
resulting in a truncated protein. Individuals heterozygous for this
mutation display reduced plasma apolipoprotein E levels. Subjects
homozygous for this allele have undetectable plasma apolipoprotein E
levels concomitant with severe forms of familial dysbetalipoproteinemia.

.0018
HYPERLIPOPROTEINEMIA, TYPE III
APOE3(-)-KOCHI
APOE, ARG145HIS

This arg145-to-his amino acid change was identified in a Japanese
subject with familial dysbetalipoproteinemia by Suehiro et al. (1990).
The variant was designated E3(-) because it is slightly more acidic than
apolipoprotein E3 (107741.0015).

.0019
HYPERLIPOPROTEINEMIA, TYPE III, ASSOCIATED WITH APOE2-FUKUOKA
APOE2-FUKUOKA
APOE, ARG158CYS AND ARG224GLN

In Japanese subjects with familial dysbetalipoproteinemia, Moriyama et
al. (1992) identified compound heterozygosity for the arg158-to-cys
(ApoE2; 107741.0001) mutation and a G-to-A transition at exon 4 leading
to a change from arginine-224 to glutamine.

.0020

HYPERLIPOPROTEINEMIA, TYPE III, ASSOCIATED WITH APOE4
APOE, CYS112ARG AND ARG251GLY

Van den Maagdenberg et al. (1993) identified in Dutch subjects with
hypertriglyceridemia 2 substitutions in an APOE3 allele: cys112arg and
arg251gly.

.0023
APOE4(-)-FREIBURG
APOE, LEU28PRO AND CYS112ARG

Wieland et al. (1991) identified an apolipoprotein E4 variant in
German-Caucasian subjects not associated with hyperlipidemia. The
variant was designated E4(-) because it is slightly more acidic than E4
(107741.0016). This variant has a leu28-to-pro substitution
(CTG-to-CCG).

.0024
APOE3(-)-FREIBURG
APOE, THR42ALA

In German-Caucasian subjects, Wieland et al. (1991) identified an
apolipoprotein E3 variant designated E3(-) that is slightly more acidic
than E3. This variant has a thr42-to-ala substitution (ACA-to-GCA) and
was not associated with hyperlipidemia.

.0025
APOE4 VARIANT
APOE, PRO84ARG AND CYS112ARG

In American-white subjects, Ordovas et al. (1987) and Wardell et al.
(1991) identified an apolipoprotein E4 variant not associated with
hyperlipidemia. This variant has a pro84-to-arg substitution
(CCG-to-CGG).

In a metaanalysis of 1,500 cases of schizophrenia versus 2,702 controls,
Allen et al. (2008) found that the odds ratio for the APOE4 versus the
APOE3 genotype was 1.16 (95% CI, 1.00-1.34; p = 0.043).

.0026
APOE3 VARIANT
APOE, ALA99THR AND ALA152PRO

In American subjects, McLean et al. (1984) identified an apolipoprotein
E3 variant not associated with hyperlipidemia. This variant has
ala99-to-thr and ala152-to-pro substitutions (GCG-to-ACG and GCC-to-CCC,
respectively).

In a metaanalysis of 1,500 cases of schizophrenia versus 2,702 controls,
Allen et al. (2008) found that the odds ratio for the APOE4 versus the
APOE3 genotype was 1.16 (95% CI, 1.00-1.34; p = 0.043).

.0027
APOE2 VARIANT
APOE, ARG134GLN

De Knijff et al. (1994) cited unpublished data identifying an
apolipoprotein E2 variant in Dutch subjects with no hyperlipidemia. This
variant has an arg134-to-gln substitution (CGG-to-CAG). The mutation is
located in the receptor-binding domain.

.0028
APOE4 VARIANT
APOE, ARG274HIS

apolipoprotein E4 variant not associated with hyperlipidemia. This
variant has an arg274-to-his substitution (TGC-to-CGC).

.0029
APOE4(+)
APOE, SER296ARG

In Dutch subjects, Van den Maagdenberg et al. (1993) identified an
apolipoprotein E4 variant not associated with hyperlipidemia. The
variant was designated E4(+) because it is slightly more basic than E4.
This variant has a ser296-to-arg substitution (AGC-to-CGC).

.0030
MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE, SEVERE, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, INCLUDED
APOE, -219G-T (dbSNP rs405509)

In a large multicenter case-control study of myocardial infarction using
567 cases and 678 controls, Lambert et al. (2000) identified an
increased risk of myocardial infarction among patients carrying the
-219T allele, a promoter polymorphism. The odds ratio was 1.29, with a
95% confidence interval of 1.09 to 1.52 and a P value of less than
0.003. The effect of the allele was independent of the presence of other
promoter polymorphisms or mutations including the APOE
epsilon-2/epsilon-3/epsilon-4 polymorphism. Moreover, the -219T allele
greatly decreased the APOE plasma concentrations in a dose-dependent
manner (P less than 0.008). Lambert et al. (2000) concluded that the
-219G-T polymorphism of the APOE regulatory region is a genetic
susceptibility risk factor for myocardial infarction and constitutes
another common risk factor for both neurodegenerative and cardiovascular
diseases.

In a large cohort of patients with angiographically documented coronary
artery disease, Ye et al. (2003) found that the APOE -219T allele and
the E4 allele had independent effects on CAD severity. The frequency of
the E4 allele and the -219T allele both increased linearly with
increasing number of diseased vessels. The -219T/T genotype conferred an
odds ratio of 1.598 in favor of increased disease severity, and the
-219T/T haplotype in combination with the E4 haplotype conferred an odds
ratio of 1.488. The findings suggested that the -219T and E4
polymorphisms, which may affect the quantity and quality of apoE,
respectively, have independent and possibly additive effects on CAD
severity.

.0031
SEA-BLUE HISTIOCYTE DISEASE
APOE, 3-BP DEL, 499CTC

Nguyen et al. (2000) reported 2 kindreds in which the sea-blue
histiocyte syndrome (269600) was associated with an apoE variant in the
absence of severe dyslipidemia. Both patients presented with mild
hypertriglyceridemia and splenomegaly. After splenectomy both patients
developed severe hypertriglyceridemia. Pathologic evaluation of the
spleen revealed the presence of sea-blue histiocytes. An APOE mutation
was found: a 3-bp deletion resulting in the loss of leucine-149 in the
receptor-binding region of APOE (delta149 leu). Although the probands
were unrelated, they were of French Canadian ancestry, suggesting the
possibility of a founder effect.

In 2 brothers with splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, and
hypertriglyceridemia, Faivre et al. (2005) identified the delta149 leu
mutation in the APOE gene. Their mother, who also had the mutation, had
only isolated hypertriglyceridemia. One brother had a large beta band in
the VLDL fraction and an elevated VLDL cholesterol-to-plasma
triglyceride ratio; Faivre et al. (2005) suggested that the more severe
phenotype might be explained by the presence of an APOE2 allele
(107741.0001) in this patient.

.0032
LIPOPROTEIN GLOMERULOPATHY
APOE SENDAI
APOE, ARG145PRO

In 3 Japanese patients with lipoprotein glomerulopathy (LPG; 611771),
Oikawa et al. (1997) identified heterozygosity for a G-to-C transversion
in exon 4 of the APOE gene that resulted in substitution of proline for
arginine at codon 145 (R145P). Two of the patients were related as
parent and child; the third patient was unrelated to them. Oikawa et al.
(1997) termed the mutation 'APOE Sendai' for the proband's city of
origin.

Ishigaki et al. (2000) introduced APOE Sendai into ApoE-deficient
hypercholesterolemic mice using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer and
observed insufficient correction of hypercholesterolemia and a marked
and temporal induction of plasma triglyceride levels. In vitro binding
studies demonstrated reduced affinity of APOE-Sendai for the low density
lipoprotein receptor (LDLR; 606945), suggesting that
dysbetalipoproteinemia in LPG is caused by the APOE mutation. Histologic
examination revealed marked intraglomerular depositions of
APOE-containing lipoproteins.

.0033
LIPOPROTEIN GLOMERULOPATHY
APOE KYOTO
APOE, ARG25CYS

In a Japanese man with lipoprotein glomerulopathy (LPG; 611771),
Matsunaga et al. (1999) detected a heterozygous C-to-T transition in
exon 3 of the APOE gene that resulted in substitution of cysteine for
arginine at codon 25 of the mature protein (R25C). The authors
designated the mutation APOE Kyoto. The proband's mother, who also
carried the mutation, was clinically unaffected.

Rovin et al. (2007) identified APOE Kyoto in 2 American males of
European descent with LPG.

607890	TITLE *607890 CKLF-LIKE MARVEL TRANSMEMBRANE DOMAIN-CONTAINING 7; CMTM7
;;CHEMOKINE-LIKE FACTOR SUPERFAMILY, MEMBER 7; CKLFSF7
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the chemokine-like factor superfamily, including CKLFSF7,
share similarity with both the chemokine (see 604852) and the
transmembrane 4 (see 300191) superfamilies of signaling molecules.

CLONING

By screening databases for sequences that share homology with
chemokine-like factor (CKLF), followed by RT-PCR of a placenta cDNA
library, Han et al. (2003) cloned CKLFSF7. They also detected a splice
variant. The deduced 175-amino acid protein contains 4 transmembrane
domains. Northern blot analysis detected a major 1.37-kb transcript that
was highly expressed in leukocytes. Han et al. (2003) also cloned mouse
Cklfsf7, which shares almost 89% sequence similarity with CKLFSF7.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Han et al. (2003) mapped the CKLFSF7 gene
to chromosome 3 between the CKLFSF6 (607889) and CKLFSF8 (607891) genes.
They mapped the mouse Cklfsf7 gene to chromosome 9, where it is embedded
within a similar cluster.
