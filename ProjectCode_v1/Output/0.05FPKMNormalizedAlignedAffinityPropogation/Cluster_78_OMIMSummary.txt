;;p53-BINDING PROTEIN 3; P53BP3;;
LUN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using murine p53 (191170) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a HeLa
cell cDNA library, Zhou et al. (1999) obtained a partial cDNA encoding
TOPORS, which they called P53BP3. TOPORS is rich in serine and arginine
and contains a leucine zipper domain, 2 PEST sequences, a central basic
domain containing 2 potential bipartite nuclear localization signals,
and 2 C-terminal PEST sequences. Northern blot analysis detected
ubiquitous but variable expression of a 5.0-kb transcript. Highest
expression was in testis, and lowest expression was in lung.
Fluorescence-labeled TOPORS localized to nuclear star-like clusters in
transfected HeLa cells.

Using the N-terminal 250 amino acids of topoisomerase I (TOP1; 126420)
as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a HeLa cell cDNA library, followed
by 5-prime RACE of leukemia cell mRNA, Haluska et al. (1999) cloned
TOPORS. They extended the 5-prime coding region reported by Zhou et al.
(1999) and determined that the full-length protein contains 1,045 amino
acids.

Using degenerate primers to amplify cDNAs encoding RING finger proteins
from human lung cDNA, followed by screening a lung cDNA library, Chu et
al. (2001) cloned TOPORS, which they designated LUN. The deduced
1,045-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 119 kD.
TOPORS contains an N-terminal PEST sequence, followed by a C3H4-type
RING finger domain, a leucine zipper coiled-coil region, 2 PEST
sequences, a nuclear localization signal, and 2 C-terminal PEST
sequences. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.8-kb transcript in brain,
kidney, liver, lung, spleen, pancreas, and skeletal muscle, and a 3.6-kb
transcript in heart and lung. Highest expression of TOPORS was in lung.
In situ hybridization of adult lung sections detected TOPORS in alveolar
epithelium and in some squamous and cuboidal cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Zhou et al. (1999) determined that a central
region of TOPORS containing the putative nuclear localization signal and
2 PEST sequences was required for interaction with p53. The leucine
zipper of TOPORS was dispensable for interaction with p53.

By coimmunoprecipitation assays of transfected HeLa cells, Haluska et
al. (1999) confirmed that TOPORS interacts with TOP1.

Chu et al. (2001) found that TOPORS had zinc-dependent DNA binding
activity. The region from amino acids 51 to 374 was responsible for DNA
binding. Chu et al. (2001) identified a palindromic DNA sequence that
bound TOPORS in the upstream regulatory region of the E-cadherin gene
(CDH1; 192090) and in 2 intervening regions of the talin gene (TLN1;
186745).

Rajendra et al. (2004) found that TOPORS functioned in vitro as an E3
ubiquitin ligase with the E2 enzymes UBCH5A (UBE2D1; 602961), UBCH5C
(UBE2D3; 602963), and UBCH6 (UBE2E1; 602916), but not with other E2
enzymes examined. A conserved tryptophan within the RING domain of
TOPORS was required for ubiquitination activity. In vitro and cellular
studies implicated p53 as a ubiquitination substrate for TOPORS. Similar
to MDM2 (164785), overexpression of TOPORS resulted in a
proteasome-dependent decrease in p53 protein expression in a human
osteosarcoma cell line.

GENE STRUCTURE

The TOPORS gene contains 3 exons and spans 13 kb (Haluska et al., 1999).

MAPPING

By FISH, Zhou et al. (1999) mapped the TOPORS gene to chromosome
12p12.1-p11.2. However, Chu et al. (2001) mapped the TOPORS gene by FISH
to chromosomes 9p21, a localization confirmed by the International
Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium (TMAP RH98974).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Chakarova et al. (2007) used a positional cloning approach to sequence
genes in the critical region on 9p21.1 linked to a form of autosomal
dominant retinitis pigmentosa with a distinct phenotype (RP31; 609923).
They identified a heterozygous 1-bp insertion in exon 3 of the TOPORS
gene in a Canadian family (609507.0001). In a small German family, a
2-bp deletion in exon 3 was associated with the characteristic phenotype
(609507.0002). Chakarova et al. (2007) commented that the ubiquitous
nature of TOPORS expression and a lack of mutant protein in patients was
highly suggestive of haploinsufficiency, rather than a dominant-negative
effect, as the molecular mechanism of the disease and made the clinical
phenotype amenable to rescue by somatic gene therapy.

In a French Canadian family with early-onset autosomal dominant

(RP31; 609923), Chakarova et al. (2007) identified a 1-bp insertion,
2474_2475insA, in exon 3 of the TOPORS gene. The mutation was predicted
to result in premature termination of the protein (tyr825fs).

In a small German family, Chakarova et al. (2007) found that autosomal

epithelium atrophy (RP31; 609923) was associated with a 2-bp deletion,
2552_2553delGA, in exon 3 of the TOPORS gene. The mutation was predicted
to result in premature termination of the protein (arg851fs).

158270	TITLE *158270 MOTILIN; MLN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Motilin, a 22-amino acid hormone synthesized by cells of the small
intestine, regulates interdigestive gastrointestinal contraction. Seino
et al. (1987) cloned a cDNA encoding the human motilin precursor from an
intestinal cDNA library. The predicted amino acid sequence indicated
that the motilin precursor consists of 115 amino acids and includes a
25-residue N-terminal signal peptide followed by the 22-amino acid
motilin sequence and a long, 68-residue C-terminal peptide.

Feighner et al. (1999) identified the motilin receptor (602885) in the
human gastrointestinal system and found that it is expressed in enteric
neurons of the human duodenum and colon.

By Northern blot analysis, Gasparini et al. (1994) detected high levels
of a 0.7-kb MLN mRNA transcript in cells containing cilia, including
bronchoepithelial cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Daikh et al. (1989) showed that the motilin gene consists of 5 exons
spanning approximately 9 kb of genomic DNA. Exon 1 encodes the 5-prime
untranslated portion of the motilin mRNA. Exons 2 and 3 encode the
signal peptide and the 22-amino acid motilin peptide.

MAPPING

By a combination of Southern analysis of somatic cell hybrids and in
situ hybridization, Fan et al. (1989) assigned the MLN gene to 6p21.2.

Gasparini et al. (1994) showed that MLN is tightly linked to the
HLA-DQ-alpha locus (HLA-DQA1; 146880). They excluded mutations in the
MLN gene as a cause of primary ciliary dyskinesia (CILD1; 244400) in a
family that had shown linkage to chromosome 6p21.

615262	TITLE *615262 METHYLTRANSFERASE-LIKE 23; METTL23
;;CHROMOSOME 17 OPEN READING FRAME 95; C17ORF95
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Methyltransferases catalyze the transfer of a methyl group from a donor,
generally S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet), to acceptor molecules,
including proteins, DNA, RNA, lipids, and small metabolites. METTL23
belongs to a family of protein lysine methyltransferases that methylate
nonhistone proteins (Cloutier et al., 2013).

CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to METTL22 (615261),
Cloutier et al. (2013) identified METTL23. The deduced protein is made
up predominantly of a Rossmann fold of alternating beta strands and
alpha helices, with a conserved AdoMet-binding site near the N terminus.
Epitope-tagged METTL23 was predominantly expressed in cytoplasmic
membrane-like structures in transfected HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By affinity purification, SDS-PAGE, and mass spectrometry, Cloutier et
al. (2013) found that METTL23 expressed in HEK293 cells interacted with
HSPA5 (138120), tubulin (see 602529), and UGGT1 (605897). UGGT2 (605898)
and HSP90B1 (191175) were also detected in the immunoprecipitate.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the METTL23 gene to chromosome 17q25.1 based on an
alignment of the METTL23 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC033998) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;TYROSYL-tRNA SYNTHETASE, MITOCHONDRIAL;;
MT-TYRRS
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching a database for tRNA synthetases, Bonnefond et al. (2005)
identified YARS2, which they called MT-TYRRS. The deduced 477-amino acid
protein contains a 16-amino acid mitochondrial targeting signal and
catalytic site motifs characteristic of amino acid tRNA synthetases.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bonnefond et al. (2005) determined that the YARS2 gene contains 5 exons
and spans 8.6 kb.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the YARS2
gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP G35326). Riley et al. (2010) stated that the
YARS2 gene maps to chromosome 12p11.21.

GENE FUNCTION

Bonnefond et al. (2005) found that recombinant YARS2 aminoacylated
purified E. coli tRNA-tyr and in vitro transcribed human mitochondrial
tRNA-tyr (MTTY; 590100). Gel-filtration chromatography showed that
recombinant YARS2 formed dimers.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Paukstelis et al. (2008) determined a 4.5-angstrom resolution co-crystal
structure of the bacteriophage Twort orf142-I2 group I intron ribozyme
bound to splicing-active, carboxy-terminally truncated mitochondrial
tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase from Neurospora. The structure shows that the
group I intron binds across the 2 subunits of the homodimeric protein
with a newly evolved RNA-binding surface distinct from that which binds
tyrosine tRNA. This RNA binding surface provides an extended scaffold
for the phosphodiester backbone of the conserved catalytic core of the
intron RNA, allowing the protein to promote the splicing of a wide
variety of group I introns. The group I intron-binding surface includes
3 small insertions and additional structural adaptations relative to
nonsplicing bacterial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases, indicating a multistep
adaptation for splicing function. Paukstelis et al. (2008) concluded
that the fungal mitochondrial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases provide a unique
model system for studying how essential proteins in general, and
aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in particular, can progressively acquire new
functions and evolve to bind multiple structurally related RNAs.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By genomewide linkage analysis followed by candidate gene sequencing of
2 consanguineous Lebanese families with myopathy, lactic acidosis, and
sideroblastic anemia-2 (MLASA2; 613561), Riley et al. (2010) identified
a homozygous mutation in the YARS2 gene (F52L; 610957.0001). In vitro
functional expression assays showed that the mutant YARS2 protein had an
overall 9-fold loss of catalytic efficiency. The findings indicated that
the mutation resulted in reduced aminoacylation efficiency, causing a
defect in mitochondrial protein synthesis with a subsequent impairment
of mitochondrial respiratory activity.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MYOPATHY, LACTIC ACIDOSIS, AND SIDEROBLASTIC ANEMIA 2
YARS2, PHE52LEU

In 3 patients from 2 consanguineous Lebanese families with mitochondrial
myopathy, lactic acidosis, and sideroblastic anemia-2 (MLASA2; 613561),
Riley et al. (2010) identified a homozygous 156C-G transversion in the
YARS2 gene, resulting in a phe52-to-leu (F52L) substitution in a
conserved region of the catalytic domain. Haplotype analysis suggested a
founder effect, but the mutation was not observed in 220 control
chromosomes, including 104 of Lebanese origin. Immunoblot analysis of
patient skeletal muscle showed slightly reduced levels of YARS2, as well
as reduced levels of mitochondrial-encoded protein subunits of
respiratory chain complexes, indicating a reduction in mitochondrial
protein synthesis. In vitro functional expression assays showed that the
mutant YARS2 protein had a 2-fold reduction in catalytic activity and a
reduction in affinity for tRNA-tyr, resulting in an overall 9-fold loss
of catalytic efficiency. The findings indicated that the mutation
resulted in reduced aminoacylation efficiency, causing a defect in
mitochondrial protein synthesis with a subsequent impairment of
mitochondrial respiratory activity.

;;ONE CUT DOMAIN, FAMILY MEMBER 1;;
HEPATOCYTE NUCLEAR FACTOR 6-ALPHA; HNF6A;;
HEPATOCYTE NUCLEAR FACTOR 6; HNF6
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Tissue-specific transcription is regulated in part by cell
type-restricted proteins that bind to defined sequences in target genes.
The DNA-binding domain of these proteins is often evolutionarily
conserved; on this basis, liver-enriched transcription factors have been
classified into various families. See, for example, HNF3A (602294) and
HNF1A (142410). Lemaigre et al. (1996) isolated from rat liver a
transcription factor, which they called hepatocyte nuclear factor-6,
that contains 2 different DNA-binding domains: a novel type of
homeodomain, and a homolog of the Drosophila cut domain. A similar
bipartite sequence had been found only in the genome of Caenorhabditis
elegans. The HNF6 cDNA encodes a deduced protein of 465 amino acids. By
RNase protection assay, the expression of HNF6 was found to be highest
in liver, but was also detectable in brain, spleen, and testis.

GENE FUNCTION

By RT-PCR, Jacquemin et al. (1999) determined the tissue distribution of
ONECUT1 in 12 human tissues. They found strong ONECUT1 expression in
liver and lower expression in testis and skin.

Vaisse et al. (1997) found that all members of the HNF3 family as well
as HNF4G (605966) and HNF6 are expressed in pancreatic beta cells. They
also identified and characterized simple tandem repeat DNA polymorphisms
in all of these genes.

Samadani and Costa (1996) determined that HNF6 activates transcription
of the promoters of HNF3B (600288) and TTR (176300). Further studies
suggested that HNF6 is important not only for the regulation of a wide
variety of genes expressed in hepatocytes and, putatively, intestinal
epithelium, but also for the inception of gut endoderm-derived organs
via activation of the HNF3B protein.

Glucocorticoids exert their effects on gene transcription through
ubiquitous receptors that bind to regulatory sequences present in many
genes. These glucocorticoid receptors are present in all cell types, yet
glucocorticoid action is controlled in a tissue-specific way. The
mechanism for this control relies on tissue-specific transcriptional
activators that bind in the vicinity of the glucocorticoid receptor and
are required for receptor action. Pierreux et al. (1999) described a
gene-specific and tissue-specific inhibitory mechanism through which
glucocorticoid action is repressed by a tissue-restricted transcription
factor, hepatocyte nuclear factor-6. HNF6 inhibits the
glucocorticoid-induced stimulation of 2 genes coding for enzymes of
liver glucose metabolism, namely 6-phosphofructo-2 kinase (PFKFB1;
311790) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK1; 261680). Binding of
HNF6 to DNA is required for inhibition of glucocorticoid receptor
activity. In vitro and in vivo experiments suggested that this
inhibition is mediated by a direct HNF6/glucocorticoid receptor
interaction involving the N-terminal domain of HNF6 and the DNA-binding
domain of the receptor. Thus, in addition to its known property of
stimulating transcription of liver-expressed genes, HNF6 can antagonize
glucocorticoid-stimulated gene transcription.

To gain insight into the transcriptional regulatory networks that
specify and maintain human tissue diversity, Odom et al. (2004) used
chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with promoter microarrays to
identify systematically the genes occupied by the transcriptional
regulators HNF1-alpha, HNF4-alpha (600281), and HNF6, together with RNA
polymerase II (see 180660), in human liver and pancreatic islets. Odom
et al. (2004) identified tissue-specific regulatory circuits formed by
HNF1-alpha, HNF4-alpha, and HNF6 with other transcription factors,
revealing how these factors function as master regulators of hepatocyte
and islet transcription.

Odom et al. (2007) analyzed the binding of HNF3B, HNF1A, HNF4A, and HNF6
to 4,000 orthologous gene pairs in hepatocytes purified from human and
mouse livers. Despite the conserved function of these factors, 41 to 89%
of the binding events seemed to be species-specific. Importantly, the
binding sites varied widely between species in ways that could not be
predicted from human-mouse sequence alignments alone.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Vaisse et al. (1997) mapped the
HNF6A gene to 15q21.1-q21.2.

ANIMAL MODEL

During mouse development, Hnf6 is expressed in the epithelial cells that
are precursors of the exocrine and endocrine pancreatic cells. Jacquemin
et al. (2000) investigated the role of Hnf6 in pancreas differentiation
by inactivating its gene in the mouse. In hnf6-null embryos, the
exocrine pancreas appeared to be normal but endocrine cell
differentiation was impaired. The expression of neurogenin-3 (NGN3;
604882), a transcription factor that is essential for determination of
endocrine cell precursors, was almost abolished. Consistent with this,
Jacquemin et al. (2000) demonstrated that Hnf6 binds to and stimulates
the ngn3 gene promoter. At birth, only a few endocrine cells were found
and the islets of Langerhans were missing. Later, the number of
endocrine cells increased and islets appeared. However, the architecture
of the islets was perturbed, and the beta cells were deficient in
glucose transporter-2 (SLC2A2; 138160) expression. Adult hnf6-null mice
were diabetic. The authors concluded that Hnf6 controls pancreatic
endocrine differentiation at the precursor stage and stated that their
data identify Hnf6 as the first positive regulator of the proendocrine
gene ngn3 in the pancreas.

During pancreatic organogenesis, endocrine cells arise from
non-self-renewing progenitors that express Ngn3. Maestro et al. (2003)
showed that from E13 to E18 (the embryonic stage during which the major
burst of beta-cell neogenesis takes place) murine pancreatic duct cells
express Hnf1b (189907), the product of the maturity-onset diabetes of
the young type-5 (MODY5; 137920) gene. Ngn3-positive cells at this stage
invariably cluster with mitotically competent Hnf1b-positive cells and
are often intercalated with these cells in the epithelium that lines the
lumen of primitive ducts. Hnf1b expression is markedly reduced in early
pancreatic epithelial cells of Hnf6-deficient mice, in which formation
of Ngn3-positive cells is defective. Maestro et al. (2003) suggested
that Hnf1b plays a role in the genetic hierarchy regulating the
generation of pancreatic endocrine cells.

120260	TITLE *120260 COLLAGEN, TYPE IX, ALPHA-2; COL9A2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The COL9A2 gene encodes the alpha-2 subunit of collagen type IX. Type IX
collagen, a heterotrimer of alpha-1 (COL9A1; 120210), alpha-2, and
alpha-3 (COL9A3; 120270) chains specific for this type of collagen, is a
cartilage-specific fibril-associated collagen (Perala et al., 1993).

CLONING

In the process of characterizing genomic clones for the mouse COL9A2
gene, Perala et al. (1993) also used 4 pairs of oligonucleotide primers
designed for amplification of murine exon sequences to construct cDNA
clones for the human gene spanning more than 90% of the coding region.
The amino acid and nucleotide sequence identities between human and
chick are 78 and 71%, respectively.

MAPPING

Perala et al. (1993) assigned the human COL9A2 gene to chromosome 1 by
study of a panel of DNAs from human/rodent somatic cell hybrids.

Warman et al. (1994) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to
regionalize the COL9A2 gene to 1p33-p32.3. A single-strand conformation
polymorphism within the murine gene was used to map Col9a2 to mouse
chromosome 4. Since one form of multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (EDM2;
600204) maps to the same region of chromosome 1, COL9A2 was considered
to be a candidate gene for that disorder.

Hellsten et al. (1995) demonstrated that the COL9A2 gene is in a 1-Mb
contig, proximal to RLF (180610) and MYCL1 (164850).

GENE FUNCTION

The cartilage collagen fibrils are formed from fibrillar collagens II
and XI (120280), while collagen IX is located on the fibril surface (see
Figure 2 in Muragaki et al., 1996). The alpha-1(IX) chain contains a
large N-terminal globular domain (NC4); a chondroitin sulfate chain is
attached to the alpha-2(IX) chain (Muragaki et al., 1996).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Multiple Epiphyseal Dysplasia 2

The usefulness of the candidate gene approach for identification of a
basic gene defect was illustrated by the finding of a mutation in the
COL9A2 gene (120260.0001) in a Dutch kindred with multiple epiphyseal
dysplasia 2 (EDM2; 600204) showing linkage to DNA markers in the region
of 1p32 (Muragaki et al., 1996). Muragaki et al. (1996) stated that the
results provided by the EDM2 'experiment of nature' represent the first
in vivo evidence for the role of collagen IX in human articular
cartilage.

Holden et al. (1999) described 2 families with distinctive
oligoepiphyseal forms of multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, in which
heterozygosity for different mutations in the COL9A2 gene (120260.0002
and 120260.0003) was found. Both of these mutations resulted in the
skipping of exon 3 from the COL9A2 mRNA, but the position of the
mutation in the splice donor site determined the stability of the mRNA
produced from the mutant allele.

- Intervertebral Disc Disease

In Finnish individuals with sciatica and radiologically documented
intervertebral disc disease (IDD; 603932), Annunen et al. (1999)
identified a mutation in the COL9A2 gene (120260.0004).

- Stickler Syndrome V

In a large 5-generation consanguineous pedigree of Asian Indian origin
segregating autosomal recessive Stickler syndrome (STL5; 614284), Baker
et al. (2011) analyzed 3 candidate collagen IX-related genes and
identified homozygosity for an 8-bp deletion in the COL9A2 gene
(120260.0006) that segregated with disease in the family.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
EPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA, MULTIPLE, 2
COL9A2, IVS3DS, T-C, +2

Muragaki et al. (1996) demonstrated a mutation in affected members of a
family with multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (600204) that showed linkage
to the 1p32 region. Affected members were heterozygous for a splice site
mutation causing exon skipping during RNA splicing and an in-frame loss
of 12 amino acids within the alpha-2 (IX) collagen chain. The results
provided the first in vivo evidence for the role of collagen IX in human
articular cartilage. The clinical findings in the family were entirely
characteristic of MED although hip complaints were less conspicuous than
in many kindreds. The specific mutation was a T-to-C transition in the
consensus donor splice site of intron 3, resulting in the skipping of
exon 3.

Jackson et al. (2010) reported a large 4-generation family with
autosomal dominant transmission of EDM2 associated with the T-to-C
transition in intron 3 (186+2T-C) of the COL9A2 gene. The family had
previously been reported by Versteylen et al. (1988). The proband was a
33-year-old woman with short stature who complained of stiff and painful
hands and knees since age 4 years. Radiographs of the knees showed
Blount disease (progressive varus deformity of the proximal tibia
associated with internal torsion of the tibia) and of the spine showed
mild spondyloarthrotic abnormalities in the thoracic region. Her sister
had painful and swollen knees since age 4 years and developed severe
osteochondritis dissecans as an adult. Two sons of the proband were also
affected, showing pain in the knees during walking and clumsy walking.
These boys also had frontal bossing, depressed nasal bridge, and were
easily fatigued with mild muscle weakness. Radiographs of 1 son at age 3
years showed delayed ossification of the epiphyses, small proximal
femoral epiphyses, and small femoral and tibial epiphyses around the
knees. Skeletal muscle biopsy and mitochondrial studies showed no
significant abnormalities, only mild variations in fiber size and
slightly diminished ATP production. Jackson et al. (2010) commented on
the mild myopathy present in the boys, and noted that EDM is
characterized by clinical variability even within the same family. The
mild myopathic and mitochondrial changes observed may be secondary to a
tendonopathy and/or cell stress response resulting from expression of
mutant collagen.

.0002
EPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA, MULTIPLE, 2
COL9A2, IVS3DS, 186G-A

In family K of Holden et al. (1999) with EDM2 (600204) the proband was a
17-year-old male of normal height who was diagnosed in childhood with
pain in the joints, mostly the knees, and genu varum. Radiographs showed
major epiphyseal changes in the knees and hands, and almost no changes
in the hips. The spine also appeared normal. The molecular change was a
G-to-A transition in the last nucleotide of exon 3, changing the last
codon of exon 3 from CCG (pro) to CCA (also pro). Although there was no
change in the amino acid, the change interfered with splicing.

Nakashima et al. (2005) identified the exon 3 G-to-A transition in the
COL9A2 gene in affected members of a Japanese family with EDM2. The
proband had bilateral double-layered patellae, indicating that this
unusual feature is not unique to autosomal recessive multiple epiphyseal
dysplasia with homozygous mutations in the DTDST gene (606718; see EDM4
226900).

Jackson et al. (2010) reported a patient with EDM2 characterized by
onset at age 3 years of an abnormal gait associated with proximal muscle
weakness. He had left-sided developmental dysplasia of the hip. The
family history was positive for hypodontia and for osteochondritis
dissecans. However, 2 affected adult family members showed improvement
of the disorder after puberty. The proband was heterozygous for the
186G-A transition in the splice donor sequence of exon 3 of the COL9A2
gene.

.0003
EPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA, MULTIPLE, 2
COL9A2, IVS3DS, G-C, +5

Family G reported by Holden et al. (1999) with an oligoepiphyseal form
of MED (600204) and a mutation in the COL9A2 gene had affected members
in 4 generations, of whom a mother and her 2 sons were available for
study. They were slightly short in stature (adult height, 158 cm), and
all 3 developed genu valgum, which required surgical correction. The
mother started walking late and with a stiff gait that became more
noticeable during ages 5 to 7 years. Her legs became increasingly bowed,
and at age 17 she underwent tibial osteotomy. She had developed
increasing problems with pain in her hands, lumbar spine, and ankles.
Her 2 sons walked at age 2 years with a stiff gait. Epiphyseal dysplasia
was recognized in them in early childhood, and they underwent tibial
osteotomy for genu valgum at ages 14 and 13, respectively. They
continued to have mild joint symptoms, including intermittent lumbar
back pain and knee pain with swelling. Changes were not found clinically
or radiographically in the hips. Affected members showed heterozygosity
for a G-to-C transversion at position +5 of intron 3.

.0004
INTERVERTEBRAL DISC DISEASE, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
COL9A2, GLN326TRP

In a study that examined for allelic variation in the COL9A2 gene in
Finnish individuals with sciatica and radiologically documented
intervertebral disc disease (IDD; 603932), Annunen et al. (1999) found a
substitution of tryptophan for glutamine at codon 326. This change was
found in 6 of 157 individuals with disc disease but in none of 174
controls. Further analysis of the families of 4 of the original patients
revealed that all individuals heterozygous for the trp substitution
demonstrated the disease phenotype. Many individuals within these
families had IDD but not the trp allele. The authors invoked a high
phenocopy rate to reconcile this observation with the conclusion that
this sequence variant within COL9A2 contributes to the pathogenesis of
disease. In the disease model chosen, this locus accounted for 10% of
disease prevalence. Under these constraints, Annunen et al. (1999)
demonstrated a lod score of 4.5 at a recombination fraction of 0.12.
Subsequent linkage disequilibrium analysis conditional on linkage gave
an additional lod score of 7.1. The authors did not exclude the
possibility that a true disease locus may lie in close physical
proximity to COL9A2.

.0005
EPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA, MULTIPLE, 2
COL9A2, IVS3DS, G-C, -1

In 12 affected members from a 4-generation family with a relatively
hip-sparing EDM2 phenotype (600204), Fiedler et al. (2002) identified a
G-to-C mutation in the last nucleotide of exon 3 of the COL9A2 gene. The
disorder was characterized by childhood onset of pain and stiffness in
the knees. Finger joints, ankles, and elbows became symptomatic during
early adult life. Some adult patients had free articular bodies which
resulted in locking of the joints. Fiedler et al. (2002) noted that a
G-to-A change at the same nucleotide had earlier been found to cause
EDM2 (120260.0002).

.0006
STICKLER SYNDROME V
COL9A2, 8-BP DEL, NT843

In an affected sister and brother from a large 5-generation
consanguineous pedigree of Asian Indian origin segregating autosomal
recessive Stickler syndrome (STL5; 614284), Baker et al. (2011)
identified homozygosity for an 8-bp deletion in the COL9A2 gene
involving the last 4 nucleotides of exon 16 and the first 4 nucleotides
of IVS16 (843_846+4del8). The deletion was predicted to cause a
frameshift and downstream premature termination codon (asp281glnfsX70).
The mutation was detected in heterozygosity in the sibs' unaffected
brother and parents.

606916	TITLE *606916 G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR 61; GPR61
;;BIOGENIC AMINE RECEPTOR-LIKE GPCR; BALGR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs, or GPRs) contain 7 transmembrane
domains and transduce extracellular signals through heterotrimeric G
proteins.

CLONING

By PCR of genomic DNA, Lee et al. (2001) obtained a partial GPR61 clone
using primers designed from the sequence of a rabbit G protein-coupled
receptor (GPCR). They used the PCR products to screen a human brain cDNA
library and found that GPR61 encodes a 417-amino acid protein that
shares over 80% identity with the rabbit homolog and 44% similarity with
GPR62 (606917) in the transmembrane region. By Northern blot analysis of
human brain areas, Lee et al. (2001) detected a 4.3-kb transcript in
caudate, putamen, and thalamus, but not in hypothalamus, hippocampus,
pons, frontal cortex, or cerebellum. No expression was found in liver or
kidney. Lee et al. (2001) also cloned rat GPR61 and, by in situ
hybridization, found widespread expression in rat brain.

Cikos et al. (2001) independently cloned GPR61, which they called BALGR.
A partial sequence was obtained by RT-PCR of human brain mRNA using
degenerate oligonucleotides corresponding to a transmembrane sequence of
GPR30 (601805). They cloned the full-length cDNA from a hypothalamus
cDNA library. They found that the deduced protein contains 451 amino
acids and has a calculated molecular mass of about 49 kD. GPR61 contains
7 putative transmembrane domains, a potential N-glycosylation site,
cysteine residues that may form a disulfide bridge, and several putative
protein kinase sites. It also contains a conserved glu-arg-tyr sequence
shared with other GPCRs. The highest sequence similarity (28-31%) was
found with biogenic amine GPCRs, i.e., serotonin, histamine, adrenergic,
and dopamine GPCRs. By semiquantitative PCR of multiple human tissues,
Cikos et al. (2001) found highest expression in brain and testes and low
but detectable expression in all other tissues examined. Their results
of Northern blot analysis of human brain regions differed from that
reported by Lee et al. (2001). Strong expression of a 4.8-kb transcript
was found in cerebral cortex, occipital pole, frontal lobe, temporal
lobe, amygdala, and hippocampus, and lower expression in putamen and
caudate nucleus. No message was detected in cerebellum, medulla
oblongata, spinal cord, corpus callosum, substantia nigra, subthalamic
nucleus, or thalamus.

MAPPING

By PCR using a human/rodent somatic cell hybrid panel as template, Cikos
et al. (2001) mapped the GPR61 gene to chromosome 1.

600423	TITLE *600423 ENDOTHELIN-CONVERTING ENZYME 1; ECE1
;;ECE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Endothelin-converting enzyme-1 is involved in the proteolytic processing
of endothelin-1 (EDN1; 131240), -2 (EDN2; 131241), and -3 (EDN3; 131242)
to biologically active peptides.

CLONING

Schmidt et al. (1994) purified a membrane-bound protease activity from
bovine endothelial cells that specifically converts the inactive form to
EDN1. The enzyme was cleaved with trypsin and peptide sequencing
analysis confirmed it to be a zinc-chelating metalloprotease containing
the typical HEXXH (HELTH) motif. RT-PCR and cDNA screens were used to
isolate the complete cDNAs of the bovine and human enzymes.

A splice variant of the same cDNA was identified by Shimada et al.
(1995) from an umbilical vein endothelial cell library. The authors
expressed the protein in COS-1 cells and could detect it in membrane
fractions from expressing cells. Yorimitsu et al. (1995) also obtained a
human ECE cDNA by screening an ACHN human renal adenocarcinoma library.
That cDNA, referred to as AECE, encoded a predicted 770-codon open
reading frame which is was different at the amino end from the Shimada
et al. (1995) sequence but close to the Schmidt et al. (1994) sequence.
The rat ECE and human AECE amino acid sequences were over 96% alike.

GENE STRUCTURE

The ECE1 gene consists of 20 exons and spans over 120 kb (Valdenaire et
al., 1999; Funke-Kaiser et al., 2000).

Valdenaire et al. (1995) found that the precursors of the ECE1 a and b
isoform mRNAs are transcribed from 2 distinct start sites, upstream from
exon 1 and exon 3, respectively. Sequence analysis of the 2 putative
promoters revealed the presence of motifs characteristic for several
transcription factors. The authors stated that comparison of the ECE
gene structure with those of other zinc metalloproteinases, as well as a
phylogenetic study, confirmed the existence of a metalloprotease
subfamily composed of ECE1, ECE2 (610145), neutral endopeptidase
(120520), Kell blood group protein (613883), and 2 bacterial enzymes.

GENE FUNCTION

Maggi et al. (2000) demonstrated that in FNC-B4 cells, which are derived
from a human fetal olfactory epithelium, both sex steroids and odorants
regulate GnRH secretion. They found biologic activity of EDN1 in this
GnRH-secreting neuronal cell. In situ hybridization and
immunohistochemistry revealed gene and protein expression of EDN1 and
ECE1 in both fetal olfactory mucosa and FNC-B4 cells. Experiments with
radiolabeled EDN1 and EDN3 strongly indicated the presence of 2 classes
of binding sites, corresponding to the ETA (16,500 sites/cell) and the
ETB receptors (8,700 sites/cell). Functional studies using selective
analogs indicated that these 2 classes of receptors subserve distinct
functions in human GnRH-secreting cells. The ETA receptor subtype
mediated an increase in intracellular calcium and GnRH secretion.

MAPPING

Valdenaire et al. (1995) mapped the ECE1 gene to chromosome 1p36 by
isotopic in situ hybridization.

By Southern blot analysis of human genomic DNA from human/mouse somatic
cell hybrids, Matsuoka et al. (1996) demonstrated that ECE1 maps to
chromosome 1. By fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), they refined
the localization to 1p36.1. By FISH, Albertin et al. (1996) mapped ECE1
to 1p36 and confirmed the localization to chromosome 1 by analysis of
monochromosomal hybrids. Radiation hybrid mapping localized the gene
tentatively at the border between 1p36.3 and 1p36.2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Hirschsprung Disease, Cardiac Defects, and Autonomic Dysfunction

Hofstra et al. (1999) described involvement of the ECE1 gene in a
patient with skip-lesions Hirschsprung disease, cardiac defects, and
autonomic dysfunction (613870). By screening all 19 exons of the gene,
using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis followed by sequencing,
they identified a heterozygous C-to-T transition, resulting in the
substitution of cysteine for arginine at position 742 (R742C;
600423.0001).

- Essential Hypertension

Funke-Kaiser et al. (2003) proposed that ECE1 is a candidate gene for
human blood pressure regulation and identified 5 polymorphisms in ECE1
among a cohort of 704 European hypertensive patients. Transient
transfection of the reporter constructs containing the -338A allele
(600423.0002) showed an increase in promoter activity compared with the
wildtype promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed the
specific binding of E2F2 (600426), a transcription factor, to both ECE1b
promoter sequences, with the -338A allele being associated with an
increased affinity to E2F2 compared with -338C. In 100 untreated
hypertensive women, both the -338A and -839G (600423.0003) alleles were
significantly associated with ambulatory blood pressure values. The
authors proposed a link between the cell cycle-associated E2F family and
blood pressure regulation via a component of the endothelin system.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yanagisawa et al. (1998) and Clouthier et al. (1998) showed that mice
deficient in either endothelin receptor type A (EDNRA; 131243) or ECE1
develop defects in a subset of cephalic and cardiac neural crest
derivatives. Ednra-null mice show defects in craniofacial structures,
great vessels, and cardiac outflow tract. Ece1-null mice exhibit a
virtually identical phenotype to Ednra-deficient and
endothelin-1-deficient embryos due to the absence of biologically active
endothelin-1. Ece1-deficient mice lack enteric neurons and
epidermal/choroidal melanocytes, reproducing the phenotype of Edn3
(131242) and Ednra knockout mice. Yanagisawa et al. (1998) elaborated on
the role of the Edn1/Ednra pathway in the patterning of the aortic arch
in mice.

Eckman et al. (2003) found that Ece1 +/- mice had significantly elevated
concentrations of both beta-amyloid-40 and beta-amyloid-42 (see APP;
104760) in their brains compared with littermate controls.

Choi et al. (2006) found that doubly transgenic mice expressing an
Alzheimer disease (104300)-associated APP mutation and overexpressing
PRKCE (176975) had decreased amyloid plaques, plaque-associated neuritic
dystrophy, and reactive astrocytosis compared to mice only expressing
the APP mutation. There was no evidence for altered APP cleavage in the
doubly transgenic mice; instead, overexpression of PRKCE increased the
activity of Ece1, which degrades beta-amyloid.

Ortmann et al. (2005) found that expression of Ece1 and Ece2 was
increased in nonobese diabetic mice compared with controls.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HIRSCHSPRUNG DISEASE, CARDIAC DEFECTS, AND AUTONOMIC DYSFUNCTION
ECE1, ARG742CYS

Hofstra et al. (1999) identified an arg742-to-cys mutation in the ECE1
gene in a patient with skip-lesions Hirschsprung disease, cardiac
defects, craniofacial abnormalities and other dysmorphic features, and
autonomic dysfunction (613870). The patient's parents were not available
for testing. Amino acid position 742 is in the vicinity of the active
site of ECE1 (Valdenaire et al., 1995). Hofstra et al. (1999) suggested
that the R742C mutation was responsible for, or at least contributed to,
the phenotype of the patient in view of the function of ECE1 during
murine development suggested by mouse models, the overlap in phenotypic
features of these mouse models and those of the patient, and the
functional consequences of the mutation on enzyme activity. The mutation
was thought to lead to the phenotype by resulting in reduced levels of
EDN1 and EDN3.

.0002
HYPERTENSION, ESSENTIAL, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
ECE1, -338C-A

Funke-Kaiser et al. (2003) identified a polymorphism in the 5-prime
flanking region of the ECE1 gene, -338C-A, that was associated with
ambulatory blood pressure values (see 145500). The polymorphism is
located within a putative consensus site for E2F (see 189971) and GATA
(see 601656) proteins. The -338A allele was associated with higher
daytime and nighttime 24-hour systolic and diastolic blood pressure in
nontreated hypertensive women. Transient transfection of the reporter
constructs containing the -338A allele showed an increase in promoter
activity compared with the wildtype promoter. Electrophoretic mobility
shift assays revealed the specific binding of E2F2 (600426), a
transcription factor, to both ECE1b promoter sequences, with the -338A
allele being associated with an increased affinity to E2F2 compared with
-338C.

.0003
HYPERTENSION, ESSENTIAL, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
ECE1, -839T-G

Funke-Kaiser et al. (2003) identified a polymorphism in the 5-prime
flanking region of the ECE1 gene, -839T-G, that was associated with
ambulatory blood pressure values (see 145500).

NECTIN 1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PVRL1, or nectin-1, belongs to the nectin subfamily of
immunoglobulin-like adhesion molecules that participate in
Ca(2+)-independent cell-cell adhesion. Nectins bind to the actin
cytoskeleton through the adaptor protein afadin (MLLT4; 159559) and are
key components of adherens junctions (summary by Barron et al. (2008)).

CLONING

Members of the immunoglobin (Ig) superfamily have been shown to serve as
receptors for various viruses. The human poliovirus receptor (PVR;
173850) is an integral membrane protein with one V-like extracellular Ig
domain, 2 C-like extracellular Ig domains, a transmembrane region, and
an intracytoplasmic region. Lopez et al. (1995) isolated a cDNA for a
poliovirus receptor related gene, which they symbolized PRR. The
predicted protein is 518 amino acids long and has a domain structure
similar to PVR. In the extracellular domain, PRR is nearly 52% identical
to PVR and 54% identical to the murine homolog of PVR. Northern blots
showed a major 5.9-kb mRNA in all tissues tested.

GENE FUNCTION

Using the Don Chinese hamster line, Carritt and Goldfarb (1976) found
that susceptibility to herpesvirus is determined by a gene on chromosome
3. Francke and Francke (1979) used a V79 line and concluded that human
chromosome 11 is responsible for susceptibility; Don and V79 did not
complement.

Geraghty et al. (1998) showed that poliovirus receptor-related protein-1
mediated entry of several alphaherpesviruses, including herpes simplex
viruses (HSV) 1 and 2, porcine pseudorabies virus (PRV), and bovine
herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1) into cells. The poliovirus receptor itself
mediated entry of PRV and BHV-1, but not of the HSV strains tested by
Geraghty et al. (1998). They found that PVRR1 was expressed in human
cells of epithelial and neuronal origin and concluded that it is a prime
candidate for the coreceptor that allows both HSV-1 and HSV-2 to infect
epithelial cells on mucosal surfaces and spread to cells of the nervous
system.

Using immunolocalization of adult mouse hippocampal sections Mizoguchi
et al. (2002) found that the nectin-afadin system colocalizes with the
cadherin (see 192090)-catenin (see 116805) system at synapses between
mossy fiber terminals and dendrites of pyramidal cells in the CA3 area.
Nectins-1 and -3 (PVRL3; 607147) asymmetrically localize at the pre- and
postsynaptic sides of puncta adherentia junctions, respectively. During
development, nectins-1 and -3 asymmetrically localize not only at puncta
adherentia junctions but also at synaptic junctions. Using rat
hippocampal neurons in culture, Mizoguchi et al. (2002) observed that
inhibition of the nectin-based adhesion results in a decrease in synapse
size and a concomitant increase in synapse number.

Togashi et al. (2011) found that mouse hair cells and supporting cells
express the immunoglobulin-like adhesion molecules nectin-1 and -3,
respectively, and that their interaction mediates the heterotypic
adhesion between these 2 cell types. Genetic removal of nectin-1 or -3
disrupted the checkerboard-like pattern, inducing aberrant attachment
between hair cells. When cells expressing either nectin-1 or -3 were
cocultured, they arranged themselves into a mosaic pattern. Thus,
Togashi et al. (2011) concluded that nectin-1 and nectin-3 promote the
formation of the checkerboard-like pattern of the auditory epithelia.

MAPPING

Lopez et al. (1995) mapped the PVRR gene to 11q23-q24 by in situ
hybridization.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The cleft lip/palate-ectodermal dysplasia syndrome (CLPED1; 225060),
which has been called both Zlotogora-Ogur syndrome and Margarita Island
ectodermal dysplasia, is characterized clinically by cleft lip/palate,
hidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, developmental defects of the hands, and,
in some cases, mental retardation. Although generally rare, CLPED1
occurs with a frequency of approximately 1 per 2,000 among the
indigenous population of Margarita Island, in whom Suzuki et al. (1998)
assigned the CLPED1 locus to 11q23 by linkage mapping. Suzuki et al.
(2000) genotyped markers spanning the CLPED1 interval in an inbred
Israeli family with a diagnosis of Zlotogora-Ogur syndrome. The proband
was homozygous and the first-cousin parents heterozygous for all markers
tested, but with a different disease-associated haplotype than in
Margarita Island families, consistent with allelism between Margarita
Island and Israeli CLPED1. Suzuki et al. (2000) followed a positional
cloning approach to identify the CLPED1 gene as PVRL1, encoding
nectin-1, an immunoglobulin-related transmembrane cell-cell adhesion
molecule that is part of the NAP cell adhesion system. Nectin-1 is also
the principal cell surface receptor for alpha-herpesviruses (Geraghty et
al., 1998). Suzuki et al. (2000) speculated that the high frequency of
CLPED1 on Margarita Island in the Caribbean Sea might have resulted from
resistance of heterozygotes to infection by these viruses.

In Margarita Island CLPED1 patients, Suzuki et al. (2000) identified a
nonsense mutation (W185X; 600644.0001) in the PVRL1 gene.

Sozen et al. (2001) demonstrated a highly significant association
between heterozygosity for the W185X mutation and sporadic, nonsyndromic
cleft lip with or without cleft palate (see 225060) in northern
Venezuela.

ANIMAL MODEL

Barron et al. (2008) found that nectin-1 -/- mice were viable and
fertile, but manifested microphthalmia and defective amelogenesis of
their incisor teeth. Nectin-1 -/- incisors lacked the normal iron
pigmentation characteristic of rodent enamel and were prone to wear and
breakage. Immunohistochemical analysis of wildtype mice showed nectin-1
staining at the interface between the maturation-stage ameloblasts and
the underlying cells of the stratum intermedium. In the absence of
nectin-1, these cell layers were separated. Numerous large desmosomes
were present at this interface in wildtype mice; however, where adhesion
persisted in nectin-1 -/- mice, the desmosomes were smaller and less
numerous. Barron et al. (2008) concluded that nectin-1 participates in
desmosome assembly.

PVRL1, TRP185TER

In Margarita Island CLPED1 patients (225060), Suzuki et al. (2000)
identified a nonsense mutation of codon trp185 (TGG to TAG) in the PVRL1
gene.

Sozen et al. (2001) demonstrated a highly significant association
between heterozygosity for the W185X mutation and nonsyndromic, sporadic
cleft lip with or without cleft palate (see 119530) in northern
Venezuela. In the Cumana region of northern Venezuela, 14 (5.8%) of 243
individuals with cleft lip with or without cleft palate carried this
mutation, versus 1 of 245 controls (0.4%) (p = 0.00039).

.0002
CLEFT LIP/PALATE-ECTODERMAL DYSPLASIA SYNDROME
PVRL1, 1-BP DEL

In an Israeli family with cleft lip/palate-ectodermal dysplasia (225060)
reported by Zlotogora et al. (1987), Suzuki et al. (2000) identified
deletion of 1 guanine from codon 185 (trp) of the PVRL1 gene, converting
TGG to T-G and resulting in a frameshift. Notably this involved the same
codon as was involved in a nonsense mutation in the Margarita Island
CLEPD1 patients (600644.0001).

.0003
CLEFT LIP/PALATE-ECTODERMAL DYSPLASIA SYNDROME
PVRL1, 1-BP DUP

In a Brazilian family with CLEPD1 (225060), Suzuki et al. (2000)
identified a single-base duplication in codon gly323 of the PVRL1 gene
(GGT to GGTT), resulting in frameshift.

131320	TITLE *131320 GATA-BINDING PROTEIN 3; GATA3
;;ENHANCER-BINDING PROTEIN GATA3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The genes for all 4 subunits of the T-cell antigen receptor (alpha,
186880; beta, 186930; gamma, 186970; and delta, 186810) are controlled
by distinct enhancers and their enhancer-binding proteins. Marine and
Winoto (1991) identified a common TCR regulatory element by
demonstrating binding of the enhancer-binding protein GATA3 to the
enhancer elements of all 4 TCR genes. GATA3 had been shown in the
chicken to be an enhancer-binding protein containing a zinc finger
domain. GATA3 mRNA was demonstrated by Northern blot analysis in T cells
but not in B cells, macrophages, or HeLa cell lines. GATA3 was
abundantly expressed in the T-lymphocyte lineage and was thought to
participate in T-cell receptor gene activation through binding to
enhancers. Labastie et al. (1994) cloned the human gene and the 5-prime
end of the mouse gene. The 2 zinc fingers of GATA3 are encoded by 2
separate exons highly conserved with those of GATA1 (305371), but no
other structural homologies between the 2 genes could be found.

GENE STRUCTURE

Labastie et al. (1994) determined that the human GATA3 gene contains 6
exons distributed over 17 kb of DNA.

MAPPING

Joulin et al. (1991) mapped the human GATA3 gene to chromosome 10p15 by
in situ hybridization, and Copeland et al. (1993) mapped the mouse Gata3
gene to chromosome 2.

GENE FUNCTION

CD4 (186940) T cells potentiate the inflammatory or humoral immune
response through the action of Th1 and Th2 cells, respectively. Zheng
and Flavell (1997) found that GATA3 was expressed at a high level in
naive, freshly activated cells and Th2 lineage cells, but subsided to a
minimal level in Th1 lineage cells as naive cells committed to their Th
subset. Antisense GATA3 inhibited the expression of all Th2 cytokine
genes in a Th2 clone. In transgenic mice, elevated GATA3 and CD4 T cells
caused Th2 cytokine gene expression in developing Th1 cells. Thus, Zheng
and Flavell (1997) concluded that GATA3 is necessary and sufficient for
Th2 cytokine gene expression.

Interleukin-5 (IL5; 147850) plays a central role in the growth and
differentiation of eosinophils and contributes to several disease
states, including asthma. There is evidence for a role for cyclic AMP as
an immunomodulator: agents that increase intracellular cAMP levels
inhibit production of cytokines predominantly produced by T-alpha-1
(Th1) cells such as IL2 (147680) and interferon-gamma (IFNG; 147570). In
contrast, the production of IL5, predominantly produced by Th2 cells, is
enhanced by these agents. Siegel et al. (1995) defined precisely the
cis-activating elements that regulate inducible murine Il5
transcription: sequences within the CLE0 element and also a region
located between -70 and -59 of the IL5 promoter that binds the
transcription factor Gata3. They speculated that activation via this
unique sequence combination confers the specificity needed for selective
expression of the IL5 gene in response to elevated levels of
intracellular cAMP.

Zhang et al. (1997) demonstrated that GATA3 is critical for expression
of the IL5 gene in Th2 cells. Whereas mutations in the GATA3 site
abolished antigen- or cAMP-stimulated IL5 promoter activation in Th2
cells, ectopic expression of GATA3 in Th1 cells or in a nonlymphoid,
non-IL5-producing cell line activated the IL5 promoter. Other findings
suggested that GATA3 gene expression may play an important role in the
balance between Th1 and Th2 subsets in immune responses. Zhang et al.
(1997) suggested that inhibition of GATA3 activity has therapeutic
potential in the treatment of asthma and other hypereosinophilic
diseases.

Zhang et al. (1998) showed that ectopic expression of GATA3 is
sufficient to drive IL5 but not IL4 gene (147780) expression. Also, in
Th2 cells, antisense GATA3 RNA inhibits IL5 but not IL4 promoter
activation. The induction of IL5 gene expression by GATA3 involves high
affinity binding of GATA3 to an inverted GATA repeat in the IL5
promoter.

Nakamura et al. (1999) found increased GATA3 gene expression in
association with cells showing an increase in IL5 mRNA in asthmatic
airways. They interpreted these findings as supporting a causal
association between augmented GATA3 expression and dysregulated IL5
expression in atopic asthma.

Tong et al. (2000) showed that murine Gata2 and Gata3 are specifically
expressed in white adipocyte precursors and that their downregulation
sets the stage for terminal differentiation. Constitutive Gata2 and
Gata3 expression suppressed adipocyte differentiation and trapped cells
at the preadipocyte stage. This effect was mediated, at least in part,
through the direct suppression of the peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor-gamma (PPARG; 601487). Gata3-deficient embryonic stem cells
exhibit an enhanced capacity to differentiate into adipocytes, and
defective Gata2 and Gata3 expression is associated with obesity. Thus,
Tong et al. (2000) concluded that GATA2 and GATA3 regulate adipocyte
differentiation through molecular control of the preadipocyte-adipocyte
transition.

Fields et al. (2002) noted that high levels of histone acetylation at
particular loci correlate with transcriptional activity, whereas reduced
levels correlate with silencing. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP), PCR, and green fluorescent protein analysis, they demonstrated
that histones in the cytokine loci (IFNG and IL4) of naive T cells are
unacetylated, but upon TCR stimulation, the loci are rapidly and
progressively acetylated on histones H3 and H4. The acetylation at the
IL4 locus occurs early, regardless of Th1/Th2 polarizing conditions,
correlating with early transcription. The maintenance of acetylation
depends on cytokine and STAT4 (600558) and STAT6 (601512) signaling and
also on the transactivator activity of TBET (604895) and GATA3, the
putative 'master regulators' of Th lineage determination.

Hwang et al. (2005) reported that TBET represses Th2 lineage commitment
through tyrosine kinase-mediated interaction between itself and GATA3
that interferes with the binding of GATA3 to its target DNA. Hwang et
al. (2005) concluded that their results provide a novel function for
tyrosine phosphorylation of a transcription factor in specifying
alternate fates of a common progenitor cell. Hwang et al. (2005) showed
that TBET phosphorylation is restricted to the TEC kinases ITK (186973)
and RLK (600058). Coexpression studies demonstrated that this was most
efficiently performed by ITK. In primary CD4 T cells isolated from ITK-,
RLK-, or double ITK/RLK-deficient mice, the greatest diminution of TBET
tyrosine phosphorylation was seen in the absence of ITK. Furthermore,
mutation of TBET at tyrosine residue 525, but not control tyrosine
residue 437, resulted in greatly reduced phosphorylation by ITK,
revealing that ITK phosphorylates TBET at residue Y525 after T cell
receptor stimulation.

Chen et al. (2006) noted that activated T cells, particularly Th1 cells,
express sialyl Lewis x, but resting T cells do not. Using reporter
analysis, they showed that TBET promoted and GATA3 repressed
transcription of FUT7 (602030), the rate-limiting enzyme for sialyl
Lewis x synthesis. TBET interfered with GATA3 binding to its target DNA,
but GATA3 also interfered with TBET binding to the FUT7 promoter. GATA3
regulated FUT7 transcription by recruiting, in a
phosphorylation-dependent manner, histone deacetylase-3 (HDAC3; 605166)
and HDAC5 (605315) and by competing with CBP (CREBBP; 600140)/p300
(EP300; 602700) in binding to the N terminus of TBET. Maximal expression
of FUT7 and sialyl Lewis x in T cells was obtained by ROG (ZBTB32;
605859)-mediated suppression of GATA3. Chen et al. (2006) concluded that
the GATA3/TBET transcription factor complex regulates cell
lineage-specific expression of lymphocyte homing receptors and that
glycoconjugates are regulated by this complex to attain cell
lineage-specific expression in Th1 and Th2 lymphocyte subsets.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Terminal deletions of chromosome 10p result in a DiGeorge (188400)-like
phenotype that includes hypoparathyroidism, heart defects, immune
deficiency, deafness, and renal malformations. One region that
contributes to this complex phenotype is that for the syndrome of
hypoparathyroidism, sensorineural deafness, and renal insufficiency
(HDRS; 146255). Van Esch et al. (2000) performed deletion-mapping
studies in 2 HDRS patients and defined a critical 200-kb region that
contains the GATA3 gene. Search for GATA3 mutations in 3 other HDR
probands identified 1 nonsense mutation (131320.0005) and 2 intragenic
deletions (131320.0003, 131320.0004) that predicted a loss of function,
as confirmed by absence of DNA binding by the mutant GATA3 protein.
These results demonstrated that GATA3 is essential in the embryonic
development of the parathyroids, auditory system, and kidneys, and
showed that GATA3 haploinsufficiency causes human HDR syndrome.

Muroya et al. (2001) studied 9 Japanese families with HDR syndrome. FISH
and microsatellite analysis showed heterozygous deletions including
GATA3 in 4 families. Sequence analysis showed heterozygous novel
mutations in 3 families, including a missense mutation in exon 4
(131320.0006), an insertion mutation (131320.0007), and a nonsense
mutation in exon 6 (131320.0008).

In 10 patients with HDR syndrome from 7 unrelated families, Nesbit et
al. (2004) identified and characterized 7 mutations in exons 3 through 6
of the GATA3 gene. Using electrophoretic mobility shift, dissociation,
yeast 2-hybrid, and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays, Nesbit
et al. (2004) demonstrated that mutations involving the C-terminal zinc
finger (ZnF2) or adjacent basic amino acids result in a loss of DNA
binding, but those of the N-terminal zinc finger (ZnF1) either lead to a
loss of interaction with specific zinc finger proteins of FOG2 (ZFPM2;
603693) or alter DNA-binding affinity.

Hernandez et al. (2007) reported a mother and daughter with HDR and
female genital tract malformations in whom they identified a deletion in
the GATA3 gene (131320.0009).

Chiu et al. (2006) sequenced the CASR (601199) and GATA3 genes in 5
unrelated Chinese families with familial hypoparathyroidism. They
identified 3 novel mutations in the GATA3 gene responsible for familial
hypoparathyroidism and deafness. Except for a previously described
polymorphism, they found no genetic variants in the CASR gene.

Ali et al. (2007) analyzed the GATA3 gene in 21 HDR probands and 14
patients with isolated hypoparathyroidism (see FIH, 146200); no
mutations were found in the FIH patients, but 13 different heterozygous
germline mutations were identified in the HDR probands, including 1
missense, 1 splice site, 3 nonsense, and 8 frameshift mutations. EMSA
analysis revealed 3 classes of GATA3 mutations: those involving of loss
of DNA binding due to loss of the C-terminal zinc finger, which
represent over 90% of mutations reported in GATA3; those resulting in
reduced DNA-binding affinity; and those that do not alter DNA binding or
affinity but likely alter the conformation change that occurs during
binding in the DNA major groove, as predicted by 3-dimensional modeling.

In a 14-year-old boy with neurologic symptoms in addition to the HDR
triad of hypoparathyroidism, sensorineural deafness, and renal
dysplasia, who did not have any microdeletion in the 22q11.2 or 10p14
regions by FISH analysis, Ferraris et al. (2009) identified a
heterozygous de novo 2-bp deletion (131320.0013) in exon2 of the GATA3
gene. The authors concluded that haploinsufficiency of GATA3 may be
responsible for a complex neurologic picture in addition to the known
triad of HDR syndrome.

In a 29-year-old Portuguese with severe hypoparathyroidism, bilateral
mild neurosensory deafness, and agenesis of the vagina and uterus but no
kidney abnormalities, Moldovan et al. (2011) analyzed the GATA3 gene and
identified a heterozygous missense mutation (C342Y; 131320.0014). The
authors noted that this patient, along with the mother and daughter with
HDR and female genital tract malformations studied by Hernandez et al.
(2007), seemed to confirm the role of GATA3 in regulating developmental
mechanisms of the uterus and vagina.

ANIMAL MODEL

Lim et al. (2000) found that null mutations of Gata3 in mice led to a
reduced accumulation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH; 191290) and dopamine
beta-hydroxylase (DPH; 223360) mRNA, whereas several other sympathetic
nervous system (SNS) genes were unaffected. They showed that Th and Dbh
deficiencies led to reduced noradrenalin in the SNS, and that
noradrenaline deficiency was the proximal cause of death in mutants by
feeding catechol intermediates to pregnant dams, thereby partially
averting Gata3 mutation-induced lethality. The older, pharmacologically
rescued mutants showed abnormalities that could not be detected in
untreated mutants. These late embryonic defects included renal
hypoplasia and developmental defects in structures derived from cephalic
neural crest cells. Thus, Lim et al. (2000) showed that Gata3 has a role
in the differentiation of multiple cell lineages during embryogenesis.

To elucidate GATA3 function, Pandolfi et al. (1995) disrupted the mouse
gene by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. Mice
heterozygous for the Gata3 mutation were found to be fertile and
appeared in all respects to be normal, whereas homozygous mutant embryos
died between days 11 and 12 postcoitum and displayed massive internal
bleeding, marked growth retardation, severe deformities of the brain and
spinal cord, and gross aberrations in fetal liver hematopoiesis. The
functions of GATA1 and GATA2 (137295) had previously been studied by
comparable methods. The results in aggregate demonstrated that each
GATA-binding protein has a unique and essential function during the
development of the mouse embryo. In each case, targeted mutagenesis also
revealed surprising roles for each factor, underscoring the power of
this experimental approach: GATA1 is essential for erythroid cell
development, while disruption of GATA2 indicates a function during very
early events in the development of all blood cell lineages.

Using microarray analysis, Kaufman et al. (2003) identified Gata3 as an
induced transcription factor in embryonic day-13 to -18.5 mouse skin.
Whole-mount in situ hybridization analysis revealed Gata3 expression in
early vibrissae follicles and later in developing epidermis and in the
cone of presumptive inner root sheath (IRS) precursor cells within hair
follicles. Examination of pharmacologically rescued Gata3 -/- embryos
and grafted Gata3 -/- skin showed aberrations in hair follicle
morphogenesis that included not only structural defects in the IRS and
hair shaft, but also molecular defects in cell lineage determination.
Kaufman et al. (2003) concluded that, along with LEF1 (153245) and WNTs
(see 164820), GATA3 is at the crossroads of both lymphocyte
differentiation and of the IRS versus hair shaft cell fate decision in
hair follicle morphogenesis.

Pai et al. (2003) generated mice conditionally lacking Gata3 at early
(double-negative) and late (double-positive) stages of thymic
differentiation. They found that Gata3 was indispensable for thymocytes
to pass through beta selection, the process by which T-cell
receptor-beta is paired with pre-T-cell receptor-alpha, a requirement
for double-negative stage-3 cell survival. Furthermore, Gata3 was
required for single-positive Cd4 thymocyte development. Pai et al.
(2003) concluded that continued expression of GATA3 is required at
multiple stages of thymocyte differentiation.

Zhu et al. (2004) generated mice with a conditional deletion of Gata3
and Gata3-deficient mouse T-cell lines and found that both Il4-dependent
and -independent Th2 differentiation was diminished, permitting Th1
differentiation in the absence of Ifng and Il12 (see 161561). Deletion
of Gata3 from established Th2 cells abolished production of Il5 and Il13
(147683), but not of Il4. Mice lacking Gata3 produced Ifng rather than
Th2 cytokines in response to infection with Nippostrongylus
brasiliensis. Zhu et al. (2004) concluded that Gata3 serves as a
principal switch in determining Th1-Th2 responses.

Van der Wees et al. (2004) analyzed auditory brainstem response
thresholds in heterozygous Gata3-knockout mice from 1 to 19 months of
age and demonstrated a hearing loss of 30 dB compared to wildtype
littermates. No physiologic or morphologic abnormalities were found in
the brainstem, cerebral cortex, or the outer or middle ear. However, the
cochleae of Gata3 +/- mice showed significant progressive morphologic
degeneration starting with the outer hair cells at the apex and
ultimately involving all hair cells and supporting cells in the entire
cochlea. Van der Wees et al. (2004) concluded that hearing loss
following GATA3 haploinsufficiency is peripheral in nature and that this
defect is detectable from early postnatal development and continues
through adulthood.

Kouros-Mehr et al. (2006) found that Gata3 was the most highly enriched
transcription factor in mammary epithelium of pubertal mice. Conditional
deletion of Gata3 led to severe defects in mammary development due to
failure in terminal end bud formation during puberty. After acute Gata3
loss, adult mice exhibited undifferentiated luminal cell expansion with
basement-membrane detachment, which led to caspase (see CASP1;
147678)-mediated cell death.

In a 33-year-old Japanese man who had hypoparathyroidism, wore hearing
aids, and had proteinuria and hematuria (HDR syndrome; 146255), Muroya
et al. (2001) identified heterozygosity for a 1099C-T transition in exon
6 of the GATA3 gene, resulting in an arg367-to-ter (R367X) substitution.
The mutation was also detected in his 3-year-old daughter, who did not
have hypoparathyroidism or renal dysplasia, but was clinically suspected
of hearing loss due to speech delay.

In an 18-year-old Han Chinese boy and his 5-year-old sister, who both
had hypoparathyroidism and bilateral sensorineural deafness but no renal
dysplasia, Sun et al. (2009) identified heterozygosity for the R367X
mutation in the GATA3 gene. The mutation was not found in either of
their unaffected parents; Sun et al. (2009) concluded that 1 of the
parents likely had germinal mosaicism of the mutant GATA3 gene.

607081	TITLE *607081 TAP-BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE; TAPBPL
;;TAP-BINDING PROTEIN-RELATED PROTEIN; TAPBPR;;
TAPBP-RELATED PROTEIN;;
TAPASIN-RELATED PROTEIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Tapasin, or TAPBP (601962), is a member of the variable-constant Ig
superfamily that links major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I
molecules to the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP;
see 170260) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The TAPBP gene is located
near the MHC complex on chromosome 6p21.3. TAPBPL is a member of the Ig
superfamily that is localized on chromosome 12p13.3, a region somewhat
paralogous to the MHC.

CLONING

By database searching with TAPBP as the probe, PAC clone analysis, and
5-prime RACE, Teng et al. (2002) identified a cDNA encoding TAPBPR. The
deduced 468-amino acid protein is 22% identical to TAPBP. It contains an
N-terminal signal sequence, a region weakly similar to an Ig-like or
fibronectin (FN1; 135600)-like domain, an IgV domain, an IgC1 domain, a
transmembrane region, and a 42-residue cytoplasmic tail with no ER
retention motif. Unlike TAPBP, TAPBPR does not have a conserved class I
molecule-binding region in its N terminus. RT-PCR analysis detected wide
expression in mouse tissues, with raised levels in kidney, adipose
tissue, salivary gland, placenta, ovary, and gut tissue. Fluorescence
microscopy demonstrated expression primarily in the ER, but also on the
cell surface. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis supported the
presence of a surface-expressed 52-kD protein, corresponding to the
predicted size. Teng et al. (2002) concluded that TAPBPR may be retained
in the ER by an unknown mechanism.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Teng et al. (2002) determined that the
TAPBPR gene contains 7 exons and spans 10 kb. Like TAPBP, TAPBPR lacks
TATA and CAATT boxes in the promoter region. In contrast to TAPBP,
TAPBPR also lacks gamma-interferon (IFNG; 147570) induction elements, a
finding supported by functional analysis.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Teng et al. (2002) localized the TAPBPL
gene to chromosome 12p13.3 between the CD27 (TNFRSF7; 186711) and VAMP1
(185880) genes.

615428	TITLE *615428 DEAD BOX POLYPEPTIDE 47; DDX47
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DDX47 is predicted to be an RNA helicase with a role in early ribosomal
biogenesis (Sekiguchi et al., 2006).

CLONING

Sekiguchi et al. (2006) cloned DDX47 by PCR of a human Burkitt lymphoma
cDNA library. The deduced 455-amino acid protein has a DEADc RNA
helicase domain in its N-terminal half, followed by a helicase
superfamily C-terminal (HELICc) domain. It also has an N-terminal
nuclear export signal and a C-terminal nuclear localization signal.
Fluorescence-tagged DDX47 colocalized with the nucleolar proteins NOP132
(NOL8; 611534) and KIAA0559 (NAP1; 608865) in nucleoli of transfected
HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using coimmunoprecipitation and mass spectrometric analyses, Lee et al.
(2005) identified DDX47 as a binding partner of GABARAP (605125) in
human 2774 and SKOV-3 ovarian tumor cell lysates. Yeast 2-hybrid
analysis confirmed the interaction. Overexpression of either DDX47 or
GABARAP alone had no effect on proliferation of SKOV-3 cells; however,
their coexpression inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis.

Sekiguchi et al. (2006) characterized proteins that immunoprecipitated
with epitope-tagged NOP132 from human 293EBNA cells. Mass spectrometric
and database analysis identified DDX18 (606355) and DDX47, in addition
to many proteins from the large and small ribosomal subunits and
proteins previously characterized in human pre-ribosomal nucleoprotein
complexes. A similar complement of proteins immunoprecipitated with
DDX18 or DDX47. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments confirmed association
of NOP132 with DDX18 and DDX47, but not with other DDX proteins. RNase
treatment significantly decreased association of NOP132 with DDX18 and
DDX47, suggesting that their interaction depends on RNA. Similarly,
RNase treatment released most of the NOP132-, DDX18-, and
DDX47-associated proteins. Epitope-tagged DDX47 associated with several
rRNA precursors and with 18S, 5.8S, and 28S rRNA, suggesting that DDX47
is involved in early stages of pre-rRNA processing. Knockdown of NOP132
by small interfering RNA caused mislocalization of DDX47 to the
nucleolar periphery. Knockdown of either NOP132 or DDX47 decreased the
amount of mature rRNA and rRNA precursors. Mutation analysis revealed
that the coiled-coil region of NOP132 interacted with the HELICc motif
of DDX47. Sekiguchi et al. (2006) concluded that NOP132 is required for
proper targeting of DDX47 to the nucleolar organizing region, and that
DDX47 has a role in early ribosome biogenesis.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the DDX47 gene to chromosome 12p13.1 based on an
alignment of the DDX47 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF078843) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37). Sekiguchi et al. (2006)

606440	TITLE *606440 STEREOCILIN; STRC
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The STRC gene, which encodes stereocilin, is expressed in the sensory
hair cells and is associated with the stereocilia, the stiff microvilli
forming the structure for mechanoreception of sound stimulation.
Mutation in the STRC gene results in nonsyndromic sensorineural deafness
(DFNB16; 603720).

CLONING

To identify genes mutated in hereditary deafness, Verpy et al. (2001)
developed a candidate gene approach based on the identification of genes
specifically or preferentially expressed in the inner ear. They
identified a mouse clone derived from a vestibular library that was
homologous to several human genomic clones derived from the 15q15
chromosomal region, within the locus for DFNB16. The human STRC protein
is made up of 1,809 amino acids and contains a putative signal peptide
and several hydrophobic segments. Using immunohistolabeling, Verpy et
al. (2001) demonstrated that, in the mouse inner ear, stereocilin is
expressed only in the sensory hair cells and is associated with the
stereocilia, the stiff microvilli forming the structure for
mechanoreception of sound stimulation.

GENE STRUCTURE

The STRC gene contains 29 exons, encompassing approximately 19 kb, and
is tandemly duplicated, with the coding sequence of the second copy
interrupted by a stop codon in exon 20 (Verpy et al., 2001). The 2
copies are in a telomere-to-centromere orientation, less than 100 kb
apart.

MAPPING

Verpy et al. (2001) identified the STRC gene on chromosome 15q15, within
the candidate region for DFNB16.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 families with autosomal recessive nonsyndromal sensorineural
deafness, mapped to the DFNB16 locus, Verpy et al. (2001) identified 2
frameshift mutations and a large deletion in the copy of the STRC gene
containing 29 coding exons.

Dgany et al. (2002) reported a French family in which a 56-year-old male
and his 2 brothers suffered from type I congenital dyserythropoietic
anemia (CDA) (224120), asthenoteratozoospermia, and nonsyndromic
deafness. They identified homozygosity for a point mutation within the
codanin gene (N598S; 607465.0003) as the cause of the type I CDA. Avidan
et al. (2003) found that the 3 sibs were also homozygous for an
approximately 70-kb deletion in chromosome 15q15, which removed the
entire stereocilin gene and truncated the CATSPER2 gene (607249). Avidan
et al. (2003) suggested that lack of functional stereocilin, which is
mutated in nonsyndromic sensorineural deafness, and CATSPER2, a
voltage-gated cation channel expressed exclusively in spermatozoa, may
explain the observed deafness and male infertility phenotypes,
respectively.

In 3 consanguineous Iranian families segregating nonsyndromic deafness
and male infertility (611102), Zhang et al. (2007) identified an
approximately 100-kb deleted region on chromosome 15q15.3 involving
KIAA0377 (610979), CKMT1B (123290), STRC, and CATSPER2. The families did
not have identical deletions and haplotype analysis indicated that the
families did not share a common ancestor; the authors noted that a large
tandem repeat on chromosome 15q15.3 makes it prone to rearrangement.
Zhang et al. (2007) stated that the hearing loss phenotype in these
families was similar by audioprofiling to that of DFNB16, suggesting
that deletion of STRC is causally related to their deafness.

ANIMAL MODEL

Verpy et al. (2008) detected stereocilin in association with horizontal
top connectors, lateral links that join adjacent stereocilia within the
outer hair cell's hair bundle. The authors found that these links were
absent in stereocilin-null mutant mice, which became progressively deaf.
At the onset of hearing, however, their cochlear sensitivity and
frequency tuning were almost normal, although masking was much reduced
and both acoustic and electrical waveform distortions were completely
lacking. From this unique functional situation, Verpy et al. (2008)
concluded that the main source of cochlear waveform distortions is a
deflection-dependent hair bundle stiffness resulting from constraints
imposed by the horizontal top connectors, and not from the intrinsic
nonlinear behavior of the mechanoelectrical transducer channel.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
DEAFNESS, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 16
STRC, 1-BP INS, 3157C

In a consanguineous family with autosomal recessive nonsyndromal
sensorineural deafness mapping to the DFNB16 locus (603720), Verpy et
al. (2001) identified an insertion of a cytosine in exon 13 at position
3157 of the STRC cDNA. This insertion, 3157insC, was expected to result
in the translocation of 19 out-of-frame amino acids and a downstream
premature termination codon at position 3214 in exon 13. The mutation
was present in homozygous form in the affected individuals.

.0002
DEAFNESS, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 16
STRC, 4-BP DEL, NT2171

In affected members of a family with autosomal recessive deafness
(603720), Verpy et al. (2001) found a 4-bp deletion in exon 5 of the
STRC gene. This mutation, 2171-2174delTTTG, also detected in the father,
was expected to result in the translation of 5 out-of-frame amino acids
and a downstream premature termination codon at position 2185 in exon 5.
Also, in both the affected children and the mother, a large deletion was
found in 1 allele of the STRC gene (606440.0003), indicating that the
affected individuals were genetic compounds.

.0003
DEAFNESS, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 16

In both the affected children and the mother of one family with
autosomal recessive nonsyndromic sensorineural deafness (603720), Verpy
et al. (2001) detected a large deletion on 1 allele of the STRC gene.
The authors located the 5-prime boundary of the deletion between intron
7 and the 3-prime end of intron 16, and the 3-prime boundary downstream
of the most 3-prime exon, indicating that the deletion extends at least
from exons 17 through 29.

103830	TITLE *103830 ALDO-KETO REDUCTASE FAMILY 1, MEMBER A1; AKR1A1
;;ALDEHYDE REDUCTASE; ALR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Aldehyde reductase (EC 1.1.1.2) and aldose reductase (EC 1.1.1.21;
103880) are monomeric NADPH-dependent oxidoreductases having wide
substrate specificities for carbonyl compounds (summary by Bohren et
al., 1989).

CLONING

Petrash et al. (1981) studied aldose reductase (AR), aldose reductase M
(ARM), and aldehyde reductase (ALR) in a variety of human tissues. Lens
aldose reductase is composed of a single subunit with molecular weight
35 kD, and liver aldehyde reductase is composed of a single subunit of
molecular weight 32 kD. Liver aldose reductase M is composed of 2
nonidentical subunits of molecular weights 35 kD and 42 kD. Lens has
only AR, liver has ARM and ALR, red cells have only ALR, while brain and
placenta have all 3 enzymes. Petrash et al. (1981) suggested that 3
loci--alpha, beta, and delta--code for these enzymes, and that AR is a
monomer of alpha polypeptide, ARM a dimer of alpha and beta subunits,
and ALR a monomer of delta polypeptide.

By screening a liver library with degenerate oligonucleotide primers
based on the protein sequence of liver aldehyde reductase, Bohren et al.
(1989) isolated aldehyde reductase cDNAs. The predicted protein contains
325 amino acids. Aldose reductase and aldehyde reductase share 3
homology domains and are 51% identical overall.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Fujii et al. (1999) mapped the
AKR1A1 gene to chromosome 1p33-p32.

By a method they referred to as 'database cloning,' Aral et al. (1996)
isolated and sequenced a cDNA encoding the human P5CS gene.

Hu et al. (1999) observed that mammalian P5CS undergoes alternative
splicing to generate 2 isoforms differing only by a 2-amino acid insert
at the N terminus of the gamma-glutamyl kinase active site. The short
isoform has high activity in the gut, where it participates in arginine
biosynthesis and is inhibited by ornithine. The long isoform, expressed
in multiple tissues, is necessary for the synthesis of proline from
glutamate and is insensitive to ornithine.

MAPPING

Jones (1975) presented evidence from cell hybrid studies that the
structural gene for the enzyme converting glutamate to its gamma
semialdehyde is located on chromosome 10. The fact that
glutamate-gamma-semialdehyde synthetase (GSAS) and glutamate
oxaloacetate transaminase (138180) are in the same biochemical pathway
and determined by genes on the same chromosome may have biologic
significance (Jones, 1975).

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Liu et al. (1996) mapped the PYCS
gene to 10q24.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Baumgartner et al. (2000) observed homozygosity for a missense mutation
in P5CS in the 2 sibs described by Rabier et al. (1992) with mental
retardation, joint hypermobility, skin hyperelasticity, cataract, and
metabolic abnormalities, including hyperammonemia, hypoprolinemia,
hypocitrullinemia, and hypoornithinemia (ARCL3A; 219150). The
arg84-to-gln mutation (R84Q; 138250.0001) alters a conserved residue in
the P5CS gamma-glutamyl kinase domain and dramatically reduces the
activity of both P5CS isoforms when expressed in mammalian cells.
Additionally, R84Q appears to destabilize the long isoform.

In affected individuals from a New Zealand family with mental
retardation, joint hypermobility, and skin laxity without metabolic
abnormalities, Bicknell et al. (2008) identified a homozygous mutation
in the ALDH18A1 gene (H784Y; 138250.0002). In vitro functional
expression studies indicated that the H784Y mutant protein retained
normal P5CS activity and did not impair proline synthesis. The findings
indicated that impaired enzymatic activity does not account for the
phenotype, as was suggested for the patients reported by Baumgartner et
al. (2000).

Skidmore et al. (2011) reported a child born of a consanguineous union
with features consistent with De Barsy syndrome (ARCL3A) with homozygous
mutation in the ALDH18A1 gene (138250.0003).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CUTIS LAXA, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, TYPE IIIA
ALDH18A1, ARG84GLN

Baumgartner et al. (2000) determined that the 2 sibs reported by Rabier
et al. (1992) with mental retardation, joint hypermobility, skin laxity,
cataracts, and metabolic abnormalities (219150) were homozygous for a
251G-A transition of the PYCS gene, resulting in an arg84-to-gln (R84Q)
substitution. The mutation impairs the function of both the long and
short isoforms of PYCS.

.0002
CUTIS LAXA, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, TYPE IIIA
ALDH18A1, HIS784TYR

In 4 affected sibs, born of consanguineous New Zealand Maori parents,
with mental retardation, joint hypermobility, skin laxity without
metabolic abnormalities (219150), Bicknell et al. (2008) identified a
homozygous 2350C-T transition in exon 18 of the ALDH18A1 gene, resulting
in a his784-to-tyr (H784Y) substitution in a conserved residue in the
C-terminal motif. In vitro functional expression studies indicated that
the H784Y-mutant protein retained normal P5CS activity and did not
impair proline synthesis. The findings indicated that impaired enzymatic
activity does not account for the phenotype.

.0003
CUTIS LAXA, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, TYPE IIIA
ALDH18A1, NT1923, G-A, +1

In a severely affected child with clinical features consistent with De
Barsy syndrome (219150), born to consanguineous parents of Pakistani
origin, Skidmore et al. (2011) reported homozygosity for a G-to-A
transition at the exon 14-intron 14 boundary (nucleotide 1923+1) of the
ALDH18A1 gene. The mutation resulted in 2 anomalous transcripts that
were predicted to encode proteins lacking the catalytic site for the
enzyme. The cellular phenotype was characterized by diminished
production of collagens type I (see 120150) and III (see 120180),
altered elastin ultrastructure, and diminished cell proliferation of
cultured dermal fibroblasts. The child had lax, wrinkled, and thin skin
with dilated and tortuous subcutaneous blood vessels, corneal clouding,
and hypotonia. The child also had severe global developmental delay and
feeding difficulties, and died in infancy of unknown causes.

;;MSX2-INTERACTING NUCLEAR TARGET; MINT;;
SMART/HDAC1-ASSOCIATED REPRESSOR PROTEIN; SHARP;;
KIAA0929
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SPEN appears to function as a nuclear matrix platform that organizes and
integrates transcriptional responses (Sierra et al., 2004).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned a partial SPEN cDNA, which they
designated KIAA0929. RT-PCR ELISA detected SPEN expression in all adult
and fetal tissues and specific adult brain regions examined, with
highest expression in adult lung, liver, ovary, and spinal cord.

Newberry et al. (1999) cloned mouse Spen, which they called Mint. The
deduced 3,576-amino acid protein is rich in proline and serine and has a
calculated molecular mass of 390 kD. It has a predicted N-terminal
helical domain with 3 RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and 3 nuclear
localization signals. The C-terminal half of Mint has high coil and beta
stand content and contains an additional nuclear localization signal.
Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues detected a 12.6-kb transcript
that was highly expressed in testis, with lower levels in brain, spleen,
lung, liver, and kidney. It was also expressed in differentiating mouse
MC3T3E1 calvarial osteoblasts. Fractionation of MC3T3E1 cells showed
that Mint was processed into 110-kD N-terminal and 250-kD C-terminal
protein fragments that accumulated with chromatin and nuclear matrix
fractions.

Using the C terminus of the nuclear receptor corepressor SMRT (NCOR2;
600848) as bait to screen human pituitary and liver cDNA libraries, Shi
et al. (2001) cloned SPEN, which they called SHARP. The deduced
3,651-amino acid protein contains 3 N-terminal RRMs, a central receptor
interaction domain (RID), and a C-terminal SMRT interaction
domain/repression domain (SID/RD). It also contains 4 consensus nuclear
localization signals. Northern blot analysis detected a SHARP transcript
of more than 12 kb. Highest expression was in brain, testis, spleen, and
thymus, with lower expression in kidney, liver, mammary gland, and skin.
SHARP expression was also detected in several human tumor cell lines.
Immunofluorescence analysis of transfected human embryonic kidney cells
revealed SHARP in a speckled nuclear localization.

Oswald et al. (2002) reported that SHARP contains 3,664 amino acids.
They identified 4 putative N-terminal RRMs, 5 nuclear localization
signals spaced throughout the molecule, and an RBP (see RBPJ;
147183)-interacting domain following the RID.

GENE FUNCTION

Using far Western analysis, Newberry et al. (1999) found that Msx2
(123101) interacted with Mint in a mouse brain expression library. The 2
proteins cosegregated with topisomerase II (see 126430) in chromatin and
nuclear matrix fractions. Gel shift analysis showed that the Mint RRM
domain bound T- and G-rich sequences, including a large G/T inverted
repeat element in the proximal promoter of rat osteocalcin (OC, or
BGLAP; 112260). Transient expression of the Mint N-terminal domain
suppressed FGF (see 131220)/forskolin-activated Oc promoter. Mint
expression was downregulated with differentiation of MC3T3E1 cells,
concomitant with upregulation of the Oc gene.

Sierra et al. (2004) showed that mouse Mint synergized with Runx2
(600211) to enhance Fgfr2 (176943)-mediated activation of the
osteocalcin FGF-responsive element (OCFRE). The RRM domain of Mint and
activation domain-3 of Runx2 were required for this activity. Confocal
immunofluorescence microscopy showed that nuclear colocalization of Mint
and Runx2 was enhanced by Fgf2 (134920) stimulation, and Mint enhanced
Runx2 activation of multiprotein complexes assembled by the OCFRE. Msx2
functioned as an inhibitor of Runx2-Mint activation of OCFRE. Sierra et
al. (2004) concluded that MINT may serve as a nuclear matrix platform
that organizes and integrates transcriptional responses.

By coimmunoprecipitation of transfected epitope-tagged proteins and by
protein pull-down assays, Shi et al. (2001) showed that SHARP interacted
directly with HDAC1 (601241). HDAC1 readily coimmunoprecipitated with
SHARP and with at least 5 members of the NuRD complex (see MTA1;
603526), and SHARP immunocomplexes displayed histone deacetylase
activity. SHARP also interacted with steroid receptor RNA cofactor SRA
(603819) and repressed SRA-potentiated steroid receptor activity. SHARP
expression was induced in MCF-7 breast cancer cells by estrogen E2
treatment. Shi et al. (2001) concluded that SHARP can function as a
cofactor for both coactivators and corepressors.

The DNA-binding protein CBF1 (RBPJ; 147183) is a transcriptional
repressor. By yeast 2-hybrid screening of embryonic human liver,
followed by protein pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation assays, Oswald
et al. (2002) showed that SHARP interacted directly with CBF1 (RBPJ;
147183), a DNA-binding transcriptional repressor. In cotransfection
experiments, SHARP repressed transcription in an HDAC-dependent fashion
and inhibited transactivation mediated by Notch1 (190198).
Overexpression of SHARP in Xenopus embryos induced a neurogenic
phenotype and rescued loss of primary neurogenesis resulting from
overexpression of dominant-active Notch1. Oswald et al. (2002) concluded
that SHARP is recruited by CBF1 to an HDAC corepressor complex that
regulates the Notch signaling pathway.

Salat et al. (2008) found that ETO (RUNX1T1; 133435) interacted directly
with the RD of SHARP in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human fetal brain
library. ETO also coimmunoprecipitated with RBPJ and SHARP from HEL
cells. Mutation analysis revealed that NHR1 and NHR2 of ETO interacted
with the RD of SHARP. ETO and SHARP colocalized with RBPJ at promoter
regions of Notch target genes. ETO expression augmented SHARP-mediated
repression of reporter gene expression in an HDAC-dependent manner.
Pharmacologic inhibition of HDAC activity completely abrogated the
repressive activity of ETO-RBPJ-SHARP in reporter gene activation.
Knockdown of ETO activated Notch target genes.

MAPPING

Hartz (2010) mapped the SPEN gene to chromosome 1p36.13 based on an
alignment of the SPEN sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB023146) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

CCT-GAMMA; CCTG;;
TCP1 RING COMPLEX, POLYPEPTIDE 5; TRIC5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Molecular chaperones are proteins capable of folding or assembling
nascent proteins in a higher order structure. A molecular chaperone
called TCP1 ring complex (TRiC) plays a role in actin and tubulin
folding. TRiC is composed of 2 heteromeric subunits of 6 to 9 different
proteins. The cytoplasmic T-complex protein-1 (TCP1; 186980), an
abundant testicular germ cell protein, has been found in this complex.
Other components of TRiC, such as TRIC5, are TCP1-related proteins
(Sevigny et al., 1994).

CLONING

Joly et al. (1994) cloned a mouse cDNA corresponding to tryptic
fragments of the bovine TRiCP5 subunit described by Frydman et al.
(1992). The mouse TRiCP5 shares 48% nucleotide and 34% amino acid
homology with mouse Tcp1. It is a cytosolic protein also found in the
nuclear matrix of several cultured human cell lines. Furthermore, like
TCP1, it is highly expressed in testis.

Sevigny et al. (1994) cloned a partial human cDNA clone homologous to
mouse TRiCP5.

Walkley et al. (1996) cloned the human cDNA from a kidney library. The
1.9-kb cDNA encodes a predicted 544-amino acid protein that is 98%
similar to the mouse sequence and 75% similar to the yeast gene. The
mRNA is expressed in a variety of human tissues and at high levels in
mouse testis.

Sevigny et al. (1996) cloned the gene coding for the mouse P5 subunit.

GENE FUNCTION

Feldman et al. (1999) demonstrated that the folding and assembly of the
VHL protein (608537) into a complex with its partner proteins, elongin B
(600787) and elongin C (600788), is directly mediated by the chaperonin
TRiC. Their results defined a novel role for TRiC in mediating
oligomerization.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sevigny et al. (1996) determined that the mouse Tric5 gene contains 14
exons distributed within 25 kb of genomic DNA. Sevigny et al. (1996)
used primer extension to demonstrate multiple transcription start points
for the Tric5 gene. This was considered consistent with the lack of any
obvious TATA box upstream of the transcription start points.

MAPPING

Sevigny et al. (1994) mapped the TRIC5 gene to chromosome 1q23 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. The fact that the human TRIC5 gene
is not on chromosome 6 like other TCP1-related proteins implied to
Sevigny et al. (1994) that the genes coding the TCP1-related proteins
present in the TCP1 ring complex are probably not organized in a cluster
and thus are not synchronously regulated by a cis-acting control region
such as the LCR involved in the regulation of globin synthesis.

Sevigny et al. (1996) showed that the mouse genome contains 1 Tric5 gene
and 1 Tric5 pseudogene located on chromosomes 3F and 5B, respectively.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs; see 603478) are proteases that
specifically cleave ubiquitin (191339) linkages, negating the action of
ubiquitin ligases. DUBA8 belongs to a DUB subfamily characterized by an
ovarian tumor (OTU) domain.

CLONING

Kayagaki et al. (2007) identified ovarian tumor domain (OTU)-containing
protein 2 (OTUD2) in a small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based screen for
OTU deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) family members. The 6,265-basepair
mRNA contains an open reading frame (ORF) predicting a 348-amino acid
protein. In addition to an OTU domain, the protein includes a zinc
finger (ZNF) C2H2 domain.

MAPPING

The YOD1 gene maps to chromosome 1q32.1 (Kayagaki et al., 2007).

604661	TITLE *604661 POTASSIUM CHANNEL-INTERACTING PROTEIN 2; KCNIP2
;;KCHIP2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In the brain and heart, rapidly inactivating (A-type) voltage-gated
potassium (Kv) currents operate at subthreshold membrane potentials to
control the excitability of neurons and cardiac myocytes. An et al.
(2000) described 3 Kv channel-interacting proteins called KCHIPs that
bind to the cytoplasmic amino termini of Kv4-alpha subunits. See KCHIP1
(604660). The KCHIP2 cDNA encodes a 252-amino acid protein that has a
distinct amino terminus but shares approximately 70% amino acid identity
with KCHIP1 and KCHIP3 throughout a carboxy-terminal 185-amino acid core
domain containing 4 EF-hand-like motifs. Expression of KCHIP2 and Kv4
together reconstituted several features of native A-type currents by
modulating the density, inactivation kinetics, and rate of recovery from
inactivation of Kv4 channels in heterologous cells. The KCHIPs
colocalized and coimmunoprecipitated with brain Kv4-alpha subunits and
are thus integral components of native Kv4 channel complexes.

GENE FUNCTION

Jeyaraj et al. (2012) provided molecular evidence that links circadian
rhythms to vulnerability in ventricular arrhythmias in mice.
Specifically, they showed that cardiac ion channel expression and QT
interval duration (an index of myocardial repolarization) exhibit
endogenous circadian rhythmicity under the control of a clock-dependent
oscillator, Kruppel-like factor-15 (KLF15; 606465). Klf15
transcriptionally controls rhythmic expression of KChIP2, a critical
subunit required for generating the transient outward potassium current.
Deficiency or excess of Klf15 causes loss of rhythmic QT variation,
abnormal repolarization, and enhanced susceptibility to ventricular
arrhythmias. Jeyaraj et al. (2012) concluded that their findings
identified circadian transcription of ion channels as a mechanism for
cardiac arrhythmogenesis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Kuo et al. (2001) found that knockout mice deficient for Kchip2
exhibited normal cardiac structure and function but displayed a
prolonged elevation in the ST segment on the electrocardiogram. The
Kchip2 -/- mice were highly susceptible to the induction of cardiac
arrhythmias. Single-cell analysis revealed a substrate for
arrhythmogenesis, including a complete absence of transient outward
potassium current (I-to) and a marked increase in action potential
duration. These studies demonstrated that a defect in KCHIP2 is
sufficient to confer a marked genetic susceptibility to arrhythmias,
establishing a novel genetic pathway for ventricular tachycardia via a
loss of the transmural gradient of I-to.

602838	TITLE *602838 PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL 3-KINASE, CLASS 2, BETA; PIK3C2B
DESCRIPTION Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) phosphorylate the 3-prime OH position
of the inositol ring of inositol lipids. They have been shown to have
critical roles in signal transduction, cell transformation, and
intracellular protein trafficking. Three classes of PI3Ks can be
distinguished on the basis of their in vitro lipid substrate
specificity, sequence homology, and structural characteristics. The
class II PI3Ks phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol and
phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, but not phosphatidylinositol
4,5-bisphosphate, and are defined by the presence of a C-terminal C2
domain. C2 domains act as calcium-dependent phospholipid binding motifs
that mediate translocation of proteins to membranes, and have also been
shown to mediate interactions between proteins.

Using RT-PCR of breast RNA with degenerate primers derived from
conserved motifs within the lipid kinase domain of PI3Ks, Brown et al.
(1997) isolated cDNAs encoding a protein that they designated HsC2-PI3K.
Sequence analysis revealed that the predicted 1,634-amino acid protein
is a PI3K that is most closely related to the class II PI3Ks. The C2
domain of HsC2-PI3K lacks 3 of 4 conserved aspartate residues implicated
in calcium binding, and therefore the authors considered it likely that
this C2 domain functions in a calcium-independent manner. Brown et al.
(1997) found by Northern blot analysis that HsC2-PI3K is expressed as an
8.5-kb transcript in various tissues, with the highest level of
expression in thymus and placenta.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Brown et al. (1997) mapped the
PIK3C2B gene to 1q32.

131320	TITLE *131320 GATA-BINDING PROTEIN 3; GATA3
;;ENHANCER-BINDING PROTEIN GATA3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The genes for all 4 subunits of the T-cell antigen receptor (alpha,
186880; beta, 186930; gamma, 186970; and delta, 186810) are controlled
by distinct enhancers and their enhancer-binding proteins. Marine and
Winoto (1991) identified a common TCR regulatory element by
demonstrating binding of the enhancer-binding protein GATA3 to the
enhancer elements of all 4 TCR genes. GATA3 had been shown in the
chicken to be an enhancer-binding protein containing a zinc finger
domain. GATA3 mRNA was demonstrated by Northern blot analysis in T cells
but not in B cells, macrophages, or HeLa cell lines. GATA3 was
abundantly expressed in the T-lymphocyte lineage and was thought to
participate in T-cell receptor gene activation through binding to
enhancers. Labastie et al. (1994) cloned the human gene and the 5-prime
end of the mouse gene. The 2 zinc fingers of GATA3 are encoded by 2
separate exons highly conserved with those of GATA1 (305371), but no
other structural homologies between the 2 genes could be found.

GENE STRUCTURE

Labastie et al. (1994) determined that the human GATA3 gene contains 6
exons distributed over 17 kb of DNA.

MAPPING

Joulin et al. (1991) mapped the human GATA3 gene to chromosome 10p15 by
in situ hybridization, and Copeland et al. (1993) mapped the mouse Gata3
gene to chromosome 2.

GENE FUNCTION

CD4 (186940) T cells potentiate the inflammatory or humoral immune
response through the action of Th1 and Th2 cells, respectively. Zheng
and Flavell (1997) found that GATA3 was expressed at a high level in
naive, freshly activated cells and Th2 lineage cells, but subsided to a
minimal level in Th1 lineage cells as naive cells committed to their Th
subset. Antisense GATA3 inhibited the expression of all Th2 cytokine
genes in a Th2 clone. In transgenic mice, elevated GATA3 and CD4 T cells
caused Th2 cytokine gene expression in developing Th1 cells. Thus, Zheng
and Flavell (1997) concluded that GATA3 is necessary and sufficient for
Th2 cytokine gene expression.

Interleukin-5 (IL5; 147850) plays a central role in the growth and
differentiation of eosinophils and contributes to several disease
states, including asthma. There is evidence for a role for cyclic AMP as
an immunomodulator: agents that increase intracellular cAMP levels
inhibit production of cytokines predominantly produced by T-alpha-1
(Th1) cells such as IL2 (147680) and interferon-gamma (IFNG; 147570). In
contrast, the production of IL5, predominantly produced by Th2 cells, is
enhanced by these agents. Siegel et al. (1995) defined precisely the
cis-activating elements that regulate inducible murine Il5
transcription: sequences within the CLE0 element and also a region
located between -70 and -59 of the IL5 promoter that binds the
transcription factor Gata3. They speculated that activation via this
unique sequence combination confers the specificity needed for selective
expression of the IL5 gene in response to elevated levels of
intracellular cAMP.

Zhang et al. (1997) demonstrated that GATA3 is critical for expression
of the IL5 gene in Th2 cells. Whereas mutations in the GATA3 site
abolished antigen- or cAMP-stimulated IL5 promoter activation in Th2
cells, ectopic expression of GATA3 in Th1 cells or in a nonlymphoid,
non-IL5-producing cell line activated the IL5 promoter. Other findings
suggested that GATA3 gene expression may play an important role in the
balance between Th1 and Th2 subsets in immune responses. Zhang et al.
(1997) suggested that inhibition of GATA3 activity has therapeutic
potential in the treatment of asthma and other hypereosinophilic
diseases.

Zhang et al. (1998) showed that ectopic expression of GATA3 is
sufficient to drive IL5 but not IL4 gene (147780) expression. Also, in
Th2 cells, antisense GATA3 RNA inhibits IL5 but not IL4 promoter
activation. The induction of IL5 gene expression by GATA3 involves high
affinity binding of GATA3 to an inverted GATA repeat in the IL5
promoter.

Nakamura et al. (1999) found increased GATA3 gene expression in
association with cells showing an increase in IL5 mRNA in asthmatic
airways. They interpreted these findings as supporting a causal
association between augmented GATA3 expression and dysregulated IL5
expression in atopic asthma.

Tong et al. (2000) showed that murine Gata2 and Gata3 are specifically
expressed in white adipocyte precursors and that their downregulation
sets the stage for terminal differentiation. Constitutive Gata2 and
Gata3 expression suppressed adipocyte differentiation and trapped cells
at the preadipocyte stage. This effect was mediated, at least in part,
through the direct suppression of the peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor-gamma (PPARG; 601487). Gata3-deficient embryonic stem cells
exhibit an enhanced capacity to differentiate into adipocytes, and
defective Gata2 and Gata3 expression is associated with obesity. Thus,
Tong et al. (2000) concluded that GATA2 and GATA3 regulate adipocyte
differentiation through molecular control of the preadipocyte-adipocyte
transition.

Fields et al. (2002) noted that high levels of histone acetylation at
particular loci correlate with transcriptional activity, whereas reduced
levels correlate with silencing. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP), PCR, and green fluorescent protein analysis, they demonstrated
that histones in the cytokine loci (IFNG and IL4) of naive T cells are
unacetylated, but upon TCR stimulation, the loci are rapidly and
progressively acetylated on histones H3 and H4. The acetylation at the
IL4 locus occurs early, regardless of Th1/Th2 polarizing conditions,
correlating with early transcription. The maintenance of acetylation
depends on cytokine and STAT4 (600558) and STAT6 (601512) signaling and
also on the transactivator activity of TBET (604895) and GATA3, the
putative 'master regulators' of Th lineage determination.

Hwang et al. (2005) reported that TBET represses Th2 lineage commitment
through tyrosine kinase-mediated interaction between itself and GATA3
that interferes with the binding of GATA3 to its target DNA. Hwang et
al. (2005) concluded that their results provide a novel function for
tyrosine phosphorylation of a transcription factor in specifying
alternate fates of a common progenitor cell. Hwang et al. (2005) showed
that TBET phosphorylation is restricted to the TEC kinases ITK (186973)
and RLK (600058). Coexpression studies demonstrated that this was most
efficiently performed by ITK. In primary CD4 T cells isolated from ITK-,
RLK-, or double ITK/RLK-deficient mice, the greatest diminution of TBET
tyrosine phosphorylation was seen in the absence of ITK. Furthermore,
mutation of TBET at tyrosine residue 525, but not control tyrosine
residue 437, resulted in greatly reduced phosphorylation by ITK,
revealing that ITK phosphorylates TBET at residue Y525 after T cell
receptor stimulation.

Chen et al. (2006) noted that activated T cells, particularly Th1 cells,
express sialyl Lewis x, but resting T cells do not. Using reporter
analysis, they showed that TBET promoted and GATA3 repressed
transcription of FUT7 (602030), the rate-limiting enzyme for sialyl
Lewis x synthesis. TBET interfered with GATA3 binding to its target DNA,
but GATA3 also interfered with TBET binding to the FUT7 promoter. GATA3
regulated FUT7 transcription by recruiting, in a
phosphorylation-dependent manner, histone deacetylase-3 (HDAC3; 605166)
and HDAC5 (605315) and by competing with CBP (CREBBP; 600140)/p300
(EP300; 602700) in binding to the N terminus of TBET. Maximal expression
of FUT7 and sialyl Lewis x in T cells was obtained by ROG (ZBTB32;
605859)-mediated suppression of GATA3. Chen et al. (2006) concluded that
the GATA3/TBET transcription factor complex regulates cell
lineage-specific expression of lymphocyte homing receptors and that
glycoconjugates are regulated by this complex to attain cell
lineage-specific expression in Th1 and Th2 lymphocyte subsets.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Terminal deletions of chromosome 10p result in a DiGeorge (188400)-like
phenotype that includes hypoparathyroidism, heart defects, immune
deficiency, deafness, and renal malformations. One region that
contributes to this complex phenotype is that for the syndrome of
hypoparathyroidism, sensorineural deafness, and renal insufficiency
(HDRS; 146255). Van Esch et al. (2000) performed deletion-mapping
studies in 2 HDRS patients and defined a critical 200-kb region that
contains the GATA3 gene. Search for GATA3 mutations in 3 other HDR
probands identified 1 nonsense mutation (131320.0005) and 2 intragenic
deletions (131320.0003, 131320.0004) that predicted a loss of function,
as confirmed by absence of DNA binding by the mutant GATA3 protein.
These results demonstrated that GATA3 is essential in the embryonic
development of the parathyroids, auditory system, and kidneys, and
showed that GATA3 haploinsufficiency causes human HDR syndrome.

Muroya et al. (2001) studied 9 Japanese families with HDR syndrome. FISH
and microsatellite analysis showed heterozygous deletions including
GATA3 in 4 families. Sequence analysis showed heterozygous novel
mutations in 3 families, including a missense mutation in exon 4
(131320.0006), an insertion mutation (131320.0007), and a nonsense
mutation in exon 6 (131320.0008).

In 10 patients with HDR syndrome from 7 unrelated families, Nesbit et
al. (2004) identified and characterized 7 mutations in exons 3 through 6
of the GATA3 gene. Using electrophoretic mobility shift, dissociation,
yeast 2-hybrid, and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays, Nesbit
et al. (2004) demonstrated that mutations involving the C-terminal zinc
finger (ZnF2) or adjacent basic amino acids result in a loss of DNA
binding, but those of the N-terminal zinc finger (ZnF1) either lead to a
loss of interaction with specific zinc finger proteins of FOG2 (ZFPM2;
603693) or alter DNA-binding affinity.

Hernandez et al. (2007) reported a mother and daughter with HDR and
female genital tract malformations in whom they identified a deletion in
the GATA3 gene (131320.0009).

Chiu et al. (2006) sequenced the CASR (601199) and GATA3 genes in 5
unrelated Chinese families with familial hypoparathyroidism. They
identified 3 novel mutations in the GATA3 gene responsible for familial
hypoparathyroidism and deafness. Except for a previously described
polymorphism, they found no genetic variants in the CASR gene.

Ali et al. (2007) analyzed the GATA3 gene in 21 HDR probands and 14
patients with isolated hypoparathyroidism (see FIH, 146200); no
mutations were found in the FIH patients, but 13 different heterozygous
germline mutations were identified in the HDR probands, including 1
missense, 1 splice site, 3 nonsense, and 8 frameshift mutations. EMSA
analysis revealed 3 classes of GATA3 mutations: those involving of loss
of DNA binding due to loss of the C-terminal zinc finger, which
represent over 90% of mutations reported in GATA3; those resulting in
reduced DNA-binding affinity; and those that do not alter DNA binding or
affinity but likely alter the conformation change that occurs during
binding in the DNA major groove, as predicted by 3-dimensional modeling.

In a 14-year-old boy with neurologic symptoms in addition to the HDR
triad of hypoparathyroidism, sensorineural deafness, and renal
dysplasia, who did not have any microdeletion in the 22q11.2 or 10p14
regions by FISH analysis, Ferraris et al. (2009) identified a
heterozygous de novo 2-bp deletion (131320.0013) in exon2 of the GATA3
gene. The authors concluded that haploinsufficiency of GATA3 may be
responsible for a complex neurologic picture in addition to the known
triad of HDR syndrome.

In a 29-year-old Portuguese with severe hypoparathyroidism, bilateral
mild neurosensory deafness, and agenesis of the vagina and uterus but no
kidney abnormalities, Moldovan et al. (2011) analyzed the GATA3 gene and
identified a heterozygous missense mutation (C342Y; 131320.0014). The
authors noted that this patient, along with the mother and daughter with
HDR and female genital tract malformations studied by Hernandez et al.
(2007), seemed to confirm the role of GATA3 in regulating developmental
mechanisms of the uterus and vagina.

ANIMAL MODEL

Lim et al. (2000) found that null mutations of Gata3 in mice led to a
reduced accumulation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH; 191290) and dopamine
beta-hydroxylase (DPH; 223360) mRNA, whereas several other sympathetic
nervous system (SNS) genes were unaffected. They showed that Th and Dbh
deficiencies led to reduced noradrenalin in the SNS, and that
noradrenaline deficiency was the proximal cause of death in mutants by
feeding catechol intermediates to pregnant dams, thereby partially
averting Gata3 mutation-induced lethality. The older, pharmacologically
rescued mutants showed abnormalities that could not be detected in
untreated mutants. These late embryonic defects included renal
hypoplasia and developmental defects in structures derived from cephalic
neural crest cells. Thus, Lim et al. (2000) showed that Gata3 has a role
in the differentiation of multiple cell lineages during embryogenesis.

To elucidate GATA3 function, Pandolfi et al. (1995) disrupted the mouse
gene by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. Mice
heterozygous for the Gata3 mutation were found to be fertile and
appeared in all respects to be normal, whereas homozygous mutant embryos
died between days 11 and 12 postcoitum and displayed massive internal
bleeding, marked growth retardation, severe deformities of the brain and
spinal cord, and gross aberrations in fetal liver hematopoiesis. The
functions of GATA1 and GATA2 (137295) had previously been studied by
comparable methods. The results in aggregate demonstrated that each
GATA-binding protein has a unique and essential function during the
development of the mouse embryo. In each case, targeted mutagenesis also
revealed surprising roles for each factor, underscoring the power of
this experimental approach: GATA1 is essential for erythroid cell
development, while disruption of GATA2 indicates a function during very
early events in the development of all blood cell lineages.

Using microarray analysis, Kaufman et al. (2003) identified Gata3 as an
induced transcription factor in embryonic day-13 to -18.5 mouse skin.
Whole-mount in situ hybridization analysis revealed Gata3 expression in
early vibrissae follicles and later in developing epidermis and in the
cone of presumptive inner root sheath (IRS) precursor cells within hair
follicles. Examination of pharmacologically rescued Gata3 -/- embryos
and grafted Gata3 -/- skin showed aberrations in hair follicle
morphogenesis that included not only structural defects in the IRS and
hair shaft, but also molecular defects in cell lineage determination.
Kaufman et al. (2003) concluded that, along with LEF1 (153245) and WNTs
(see 164820), GATA3 is at the crossroads of both lymphocyte
differentiation and of the IRS versus hair shaft cell fate decision in
hair follicle morphogenesis.

Pai et al. (2003) generated mice conditionally lacking Gata3 at early
(double-negative) and late (double-positive) stages of thymic
differentiation. They found that Gata3 was indispensable for thymocytes
to pass through beta selection, the process by which T-cell
receptor-beta is paired with pre-T-cell receptor-alpha, a requirement
for double-negative stage-3 cell survival. Furthermore, Gata3 was
required for single-positive Cd4 thymocyte development. Pai et al.
(2003) concluded that continued expression of GATA3 is required at
multiple stages of thymocyte differentiation.

Zhu et al. (2004) generated mice with a conditional deletion of Gata3
and Gata3-deficient mouse T-cell lines and found that both Il4-dependent
and -independent Th2 differentiation was diminished, permitting Th1
differentiation in the absence of Ifng and Il12 (see 161561). Deletion
of Gata3 from established Th2 cells abolished production of Il5 and Il13
(147683), but not of Il4. Mice lacking Gata3 produced Ifng rather than
Th2 cytokines in response to infection with Nippostrongylus
brasiliensis. Zhu et al. (2004) concluded that Gata3 serves as a
principal switch in determining Th1-Th2 responses.

Van der Wees et al. (2004) analyzed auditory brainstem response
thresholds in heterozygous Gata3-knockout mice from 1 to 19 months of
age and demonstrated a hearing loss of 30 dB compared to wildtype
littermates. No physiologic or morphologic abnormalities were found in
the brainstem, cerebral cortex, or the outer or middle ear. However, the
cochleae of Gata3 +/- mice showed significant progressive morphologic
degeneration starting with the outer hair cells at the apex and
ultimately involving all hair cells and supporting cells in the entire
cochlea. Van der Wees et al. (2004) concluded that hearing loss
following GATA3 haploinsufficiency is peripheral in nature and that this
defect is detectable from early postnatal development and continues
through adulthood.

Kouros-Mehr et al. (2006) found that Gata3 was the most highly enriched
transcription factor in mammary epithelium of pubertal mice. Conditional
deletion of Gata3 led to severe defects in mammary development due to
failure in terminal end bud formation during puberty. After acute Gata3
loss, adult mice exhibited undifferentiated luminal cell expansion with
basement-membrane detachment, which led to caspase (see CASP1;
147678)-mediated cell death.

The mutation was also detected in his 3-year-old daughter, who did not
have hypoparathyroidism or renal dysplasia, but was clinically suspected
of hearing loss due to speech delay.

In an 18-year-old Han Chinese boy and his 5-year-old sister, who both
had hypoparathyroidism and bilateral sensorineural deafness but no renal
dysplasia, Sun et al. (2009) identified heterozygosity for the R367X

2-bp deletion (108delGG) in exon 2 of the GATA3 gene, resulting in a
frameshift and a premature stop codon after a new 15-amino acid
sequence. The unaffected parents did not carry the mutation, which was
also not found in 100 controls. Neurologic involvement included basal
ganglia calcifications, palpebral ptosis, postural strabismus,
horizontal nystagmus, and pseudopapilledema.

HYPOPARATHYROIDISM, SENSORINEURAL DEAFNESS, AND RENAL DYSPLASIA SYNDROME
GATA3, CYS342TYR

In a 29-year-old Portuguese woman with severe hypoparathyroidism,
bilateral mild neurosensory deafness, and agenesis of the vagina and
uterus but no kidney abnormalities (see 146255), Moldovan et al. (2011)
identified heterozygosity for a 1025G-A transition in exon 5 of the
GATA3 gene, resulting in a cys342-to-tyr (C342Y) substitution at a
highly conserved residue within the functionally important zinc finger-2
domain. The parents were unavailable for study, but there was no family
history of the disease.

601045	TITLE *601045 CATENIN, DELTA-1; CTNND1
;;CATENIN, DELTA; CTNND;;
CADHERIN-ASSOCIATED SRC SUBSTRATE; CAS;;
p120(CTN)
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Catenins were discovered as proteins that are linked ('catena' means
'chain' in Latin) to the cytoplasmic domain of transmembrane cadherin
(see 601120) proteins. Delta-catenin, also called CAS, p120(cas), or
p120(ctn), is a tyrosine kinase substrate implicated in ligand-induced
receptor signaling through the EGF receptor (131550), the PDGF receptor
(PDGFR; see 173490), and the CSF1 receptor (164770), as well as in cell
transformation by SRC (190090). Delta-catenin is a major component of
multiprotein cell-cell adhesion complexes containing E-cadherin
(192090), alpha-catenin (116805), beta-catenin (116806), and
gamma-catenin, also known as plakoglobin (173325) (summary by
Keirsebilck et al., 1998).

CLONING

Reynolds et al. (1992) isolated a mouse p120(ctn) cDNA. Like
beta-catenin and plakoglobin, the predicted protein contains copies of a
repeat originally identified in the Drosophila 'Armadillo' protein.

Keirsebilck et al. (1998) identified human p120(ctn) isoforms, which
they designated 1 to 4, that arise by alternative use of start codons
and additional isoforms that differ due to alternative splicing of 3
exons, which they named A, B, and C. The longest isoform was of type
1ABC and contained 968 amino acids. Isoform 1A contains 933 amino acids
and is 97% identical to mouse p120(ctn). Human p120(ctn) contains up to
10 Armadillo repeats. Keirsebilck et al. (1998) used RT-PCR to
demonstrate tissue-specific and cell line-specific expression of various
isoforms.

Independently, Nagase et al. (1997) identified KIAA0384, a human
p120(ctn) cDNA that encodes isoform 1AC, in a screen for brain cDNAs
encoding proteins larger than 100 kD. RT-PCR detected expression in all
tissues examined except skeletal muscle. Highest expression was detected
in placenta, lung, liver, and kidney, followed by ovary and small
intestine.

GENE FUNCTION

Dillon et al. (1998) reported that a complete loss of p120(ctn)
expression was observed in approximately 10% of invasive ductal breast
carcinomas investigated.

Wildenberg et al. (2006) found that depletion of p120-catenin in NIH3T3
mouse fibroblasts by small interfering RNA caused constitutive
activation of Rho (RHOA; 165390), cell transformation, loss of contact
inhibition, and growth in the absence of serum. Moreover, Pdgfr and
integrin (see 135630) signaling pathways involved in remodeling the
actin cytoskeleton were selectively impaired. Wildenberg et al. (2006)
traced these effects to obligatory roles of p120-catenin and Arhgap5
(602680) in a pathway that connects Rac (RAC1; 602048) activation to Rho
inhibition. They concluded that p120-catenin and ARHGAP5 use Rho GTPases
to mediate crosstalk between a wide variety of receptors to coordinate
cadherin function with other activities that direct cell adhesion,
motility, and proliferation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Keirsebilck et al. (1998) determined that the human p120(ctn) gene
contains 21 exons, potentially encoding up to 32 protein isoforms as
products of alternative splicing.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Reynolds et al. (1996) determined
that the human gene, symbolized CTNND, is localized immediately adjacent
to the centromere in band 11q11. By interspecific backcross analysis,
they assigned the murine gene, symbolized Catns, to the middle of mouse
chromosome 2. By analysis of radiation hybrids, Nagase et al. (1997)
confirmed that the p120 gene maps to human chromosome 11. By
fluorescence in situ hybridization and analysis of a somatic cell hybrid
mapping panel, Bonne et al. (1998) mapped the CTNND1 gene to chromosome
11q11.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using conditional targeting of p120(ctn) in mouse epidermis,
Perez-Moreno et al. (2006) found that p120-null neonatal epidermis
exhibited reduced intercellular adherens junction components, but no
overt disruption in barrier function or intercellular adhesion. As the
mice aged, they displayed epidermal hypoplasia and chronic inflammation,
typified by hair degeneration and loss of body fat. Use of skin
engraftments and antiinflammatory drugs showed that these features were
not due to reductions in junctional cadherins and catenins, but rather
to NF-kappa-B (see 164011) activation. Both in vivo and in vitro,
p120-null epidermal cells activated NF-kappa-B, triggering a cascade of
proinflammatory NF-kappa-B targets. NF-kappa-B activation in p120-null
keratinocytes was accompanied by alterations in Rho GTPase activity that
appeared to reside upstream from NF-kappa-B activation and downstream
from p120 loss.

601140	TITLE *601140 PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 1, REGULATORY SUBUNIT 14B; PPP1R14B
;;PHOSPHOLIPASE C, BETA-3, NEIGHBORING GENE OF; PLCB3N;;
PNG
DESCRIPTION Using a cosmid that contained the gene for phospholipase C-beta-3
(PLCB3; 600230), Lagercrantz et al. (1996) isolated and characterized a
gene that they called PLCB3-neighboring gene (PNG). PLCB3 is located on
11q13. PNG had no striking similarity to other known genes at the DNA
level, however, analysis of hybridization to a panel of somatic cell
hybrids indicated the existence of related sequences on chromosomes 2,
4, 7, and 22. PNG showed expression of a 1-kb message in multiple
tissues. The predicted protein is 119 amino acids long. The gene spans
approximately 2.5 kb and is divided into 4 exons and 3 introns. It is
located 4.4 kb upstream of PLCB3, with the 5-prime ends of each gene
facing each other. The intragenic region showed separate CpG islands at
each end separated by a stretch of 2 kb, characterized by periodic
alteration of the GC content. A 5-prime flanking region of PNG did not
contain TATA or CCAAT, suggesting to the authors a housekeeping promoter
structure.

Lagercrantz et al. (1996) described isolation and expression of the
murine homolog. The predicted murine protein contains 203 amino acids.

615364	TITLE *615364 ADENYLATE KINASE 7; AK7
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Adenylate kinases (AKs; EC 2.7.4.3), such as AK7, are
phosphotransferases that catalyze the interconversion of nucleoside
phosphates. AKs maintain high levels of ATP in a combined action with
mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, are required for DNA and RNA
synthesis, and may contribute to the activity of medicinal nucleoside
and nucleotide analogs (summary by Panayiotou et al., 2011).

CLONING

Panayiotou et al. (2011) cloned and characterized human AK7. The deduced
723-amino acid protein has an N-terminal domain of 368 amino acids that
is not found in other AKs, followed by a classic AK domain and a
C-terminal DPY30 (612032) motif. Fluorescence-tagged AK7 localized to
the cytosol of transfected HeLa cells.

Fernandez-Gonzalez et al. (2009) identified 3 splice variants of mouse
Ak7. The full-length, 723-amino acid Ak7 protein, which they called
Ak7a, has a WcaG motif near the N terminus, followed by an AK domain and
a C-terminal DPY30 motif. The WcaG motif is a signature of some
prokaryotic nucleoside diphosphate sugar epimerases, and the DPY30 motif
is a protein oligomerization motif. Compared with Ak7a, the Ak7b isoform
contains a C-terminal truncation and lacks the DPY30 motif, and Ak7c is
further truncated and lacks both the AK domain and DPY30 motif. RT-PCR
analysis of mouse tissues detected highest Ak7 expression in testis,
followed by trachea and oviduct. Lower expression was detected in brain
and lung, and no expression was detected in heart, kidney, liver, and
spleen. In situ hybridization revealed that Ak7 expression in brain was
restricted to ependymal cells lining the third ventricle and to choroid
plexus. In lung, Ak7 was expressed in the descending airways. In testis,
abundant Ak7 expression was found in seminiferous tubules, where it
colocalized with differentiating cells and mature spermatids. AK7 was
also expressed in respiratory epithelium of trachea. Fernandez-Gonzalez
et al. (2009) noted that Ak7 was expressed in tissues rich in epithelial
ciliated cells with (9+2) axonemes. Database analysis revealed
conservation of Ak7 only among organisms possessing motile (9+2) cilia.

GENE FUNCTION

In human nasal epithelial cell culture, Milara et al. (2010) found that
AK7 expression was upregulated during ciliogenesis and was widely
expressed in differentiated nasal epithelial cells with predominant
expression on the apical surface, suggesting that it localizes to
ciliated cells. Knockdown of AK7 using siRNA caused a decrease in
ciliary beat frequency. Nasal biopsy from patients with primary ciliary
dyskinesia showed lower AK7 mRNA and protein expression compared to
healthy control samples. The findings suggested that AK7 is involved in
ciliary beat, and Milara et al. (2010) hypothesized that downregulation
of energy transport due to decreased expression of AK7 may contribute to
the development of ciliary dyskinesia.

Panayiotou et al. (2011) found that in vitro-translated AK7 and AK8
(615365) showed highest affinity for AMP as substrate with ATP as the
phosphate donor. Both also recognized dAMP, CMP, and dCMP as substrates.
Both showed a higher affinity for AMP than the major cytosolic adenylate
kinase, AK1 (103000), but they had a much lower maximal catalytic rate
than AK1.

GENE STRUCTURE

Panayiotou et al. (2011) determined that the AK7 gene contains 18 exons
and spans 96.7 kb.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the AK7 gene to chromosome 14q32.2 based on an
alignment of the AK7 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK057426) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

ANIMAL MODEL

Using transgene insertional mutagenesis, Fernandez-Gonzalez et al.
(2009) developed a line of mice that had insertion of the transgene in
intron 5 of the Ak7 gene. No Ak7 expression was detected in homozygous
transgenic (Ak7 -/-) mice. Ak7 -/- mice showed signs of primary ciliary
dyskinesia (see 244400), and about half showed severe hydrocephalus soon
after birth and died within the first month. About 25% exhibited milder
ventricular expansion and survived more than 6 weeks. At 42 days, male
Ak7 -/- mice lacked mature spermatids and spermatozoa, and electron
microscopy showed abnormal sperm heads and absence of tail structures.
At sexual maturity, male, but not female, Ak7 -/- mice were infertile.
Ak7 -/- animals also showed mucus accumulation in paranasal passages and
developed dramatic respiratory pathology upon allergen challenge.
Electron microscopic analysis of bronchial epithelial cells revealed
reduced number of motile cilia, and cilia showed axonemes with missing
central microtubule doublets and abnormal peripheral microtubules.
Morphologic defects in Ak7 -/- cilia were accompanied by significantly
reduced ciliary beat frequency.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
AK7, 1-BP INS, 1214T

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to primary ciliary dyskinesia (CILD; see 244400) has
not been confirmed.

In 3 of 31 unrelated patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia, Mata et
al. (2012) identified a heterozygous 1-bp insertion (c.1214insT) in the
AK7 gene, predicted to result in a frameshift and premature termination
in the active catalytic center of the protein. The mutation was not
found in 40 control individuals. Analysis of family members of 1 of the
patients showed that his unaffected mother, father, and brother all
carried the wildtype AK7 genotype. Family members of the other 2
patients were not studied, so segregation of the mutation with the
disorder could not be determined. None of the patients had a family
history of respiratory disease. RT-PCR with primers directed against the
last 2 exons of the AK7 gene showed virtual absence of mutant AK7 mRNA
in patients with the truncating mutation. Protein quantification was not
possible due to insufficient material. Two of the patients had situs
inversus, consistent with a diagnosis of Kartagener syndrome. Analysis
of cilia showed absence of dynein in 1 patient, uncoordinated motion
pattern in 2, and motionless cilia in the third. Nasal airway epithelial
cells from 1 of the patients showed cilia, but there was a decrease in
cilia density and a decrease in beat frequency compared to controls.
Mata et al. (2012) suggested that mutation in the AK7 gene may be
associated with CILD, but also noted that the patients may have more
than 1 alteration in genes involved in the development of the disorder;
other genes were not studied in these patients. The AK7 gene was chosen
for study because homozygous Ak7-null mice develop CILD
(Fernandez-Gonzalez et al., 2009) and patients with CILD have been shown
to have decreased expression of AK7 (Milara et al., 2010).

610038	TITLE *610038 VACUOLAR PROTEIN SORTING 37, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF, C; VPS37C
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

VPS37C is a subunit of ESCRT-I (endosomal sorting complex required for
transport I), a complex in the class E vacuolar protein sorting (VPS)
pathway required for sorting ubiquitinated transmembrane proteins into
internal vesicles of multivesicular bodies (Eastman et al., 2005).

CLONING

By searching a database for sequences homologous to yeast Vps37,
Stuchell et al. (2004) identified human VPS37C. The deduced 523-amino
acid protein contains a central mod(r) (modifier of rudimentary) domain
and 2 coiled-coil regions, one overlapping the N-terminal border of the
mod(r) domain and the other within the mod(r) domain.

Using TSG101 (601387) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a peripheral
mononuclear lymphocyte cDNA library, Eastman et al. (2005) cloned
VPS37C. The deduced 355-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal mod(r)
domain and a C-terminal proline-rich domain.

GENE FUNCTION

Eastman et al. (2005) found that VPS37C formed a ternary complex with
TSG101 and VPS28 (601387) by binding a C-terminal domain of TSG101.
VPS37C also bound HRS (HGS; 604375), another class E VPS factor. VPS37C
was recruited to aberrant endosomes induced by overexpression of TSG101,
HRS, or a dominant-negative form of VPS4 (VPS4A; 609982). Enveloped
viruses that encode PTAP motifs to facilitate budding, like human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 Gag protein, exploit ESCRT-I as an
interface with the class E VPS pathway. VPS37C was recruited to the
plasma membrane along with TSG101 by HIV-1 Gag. Moreover, direct fusion
of VPS37C to HIV-1 Gag obviated the requirement for a PTAP motif to
induce virion release. Depletion of VPS37C from human embryonic kidney
cells did not inhibit murine leukemia virus budding, which is not
mediated by ESCRT-I. However, if murine leukemia virus budding was
engineered to be ESCRT-I-dependent, it was inhibited by VPS37C
depletion, and the inhibition was accentuated if VPS37B (610037) was
simultaneously depleted. Eastman et al. (2005) concluded that VPS37C is
a functional component of mammalian ESCRT-I.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the VPS37C
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP SHGC-31731).

PROTOONCOGENE BCD1;;
TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR ZF9; ZF9;;
CORE PROMOTER ELEMENT-BINDING PROTEIN; COPEB
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Members of the pregnancy-specific glycoprotein (PSG) family and related
genes do not have TATA boxes or the initiator in their promoter regions.
To identify proteins that regulate PSG gene expression, Koritschoner et
al. (1997) screened a placenta expression library with the core promoter
element (CPE) from PSG5 (176394). They isolated cDNAs encoding a protein
that they called 'core promoter element-binding protein' (CBPB or
COPEB). By sequence analysis, Koritschoner et al. (1997) found 2
possible translation initiation codons, use of which would produce
predicted proteins of either 283 or 290 amino acids. COPEB contains an
N-terminal acidic domain, a serine/threonine-rich central region, and 3
contiguous zinc finger domains in the C-terminal region. The in vitro
COPEB translation product had a mass of 32 kD by SDS-PAGE. Using
mammalian cells expressing COPEB, Koritschoner et al. (1997) showed that
COPEB is capable of activating transcription approximately 4-fold from
the PSG5 promoter. A Gal4-COPEB fusion protein activated transcription
from a heterologous promoter containing Gal4 binding sites. Northern
blot analysis revealed that COPEB is expressed as a 4.5-kb mRNA in
several tissues, with the highest levels in placenta.

El Rouby and Newcomb (1996) identified a novel protooncogene expressed
in B cells, designated BCD1 by them. They cloned it from the peripheral
blood lymphocytes of a B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient
through its capacity to transform NIH 3T3 cells. The expression of the
BCD1 gene was limited to 2 tissues, CD19+ B-cells and testis of normal
individuals. Malignant B cells from 50% of patients with B-cell chronic
lymphocytic leukemia studied showed no detectable BCD1 gene transcripts;
however, when malignant B cells were stimulated to undergo terminal
differentiation into plasma cells, BCD1 gene expression was induced,
suggesting an association with B-cell maturation. Since the BCD1
sequence was isolated from a leukemia patient, Patrito and Bocco (1998)
suggested that the sequence differences between COPEB and BCD1 arose as
a consequence of tumor development. The differences may be due to a
rearrangement between COPEB and another ubiquitously expressed protein,
resulting in a fusion protein, or to multiple mutations in COPEB.

Wound repair in parenchymal tissues requires coordinate changes in
resident mesenchymal cells that ultimately lead to fibrosis. In the
liver, this response involves hepatic stellate cells, which are a
nonparenchymal cell type located in the subendothelial space of the
sinusoid. Stellate cells express the myogenic intermediate filament
desmin, and, in normal liver, are the primary storage site for
retinoids, which are found in cytoplasmic droplets in retinyl esters.
Analogous cells in other organs include mesangial cells in kidney and
pulmonary fibroblasts in lung. The response of stellate cells to injury
is termed 'activation' and represents a cellular program with a distinct
temporal sequence involving both up- and downregulation of gene
expression. The methods for isolating and culturing stellate cells are
useful for exploring molecular mechanisms of stellate cell activation.
To broaden the search for transcription factors involved in the
activation process, subtraction hybridization was used to identify
transcripts induced early in rat stellate cells in vivo after a single
dose of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), a known precipitant of hepatic
fibrosis. In this way cDNA showing homology to zinc finger proteins was
isolated. Ratziu et al. (1998) isolated full-length rat and human cDNAs,
which they termed ZF9, and characterized production of ZF9 protein. They
established that ZF9 is a nuclear DNA-binding protein in activated cells
that, in a context-dependent manner, transactivates a key promoter
driving stellate cell fibrogenesis. The ZF9 nucleotide sequence predicts
that it is a member of the Kruppel-like family with a unique N-terminal
domain rich in serine-proline clusters and leucines. ZF9 binds
specifically to a DNA oligonucleotide containing a GC-box motif. Ratziu
et al. (1998) noted that COPEB/BCD1 is the human homolog of Zf9.

MAPPING

El Rouby et al. (1997) determined the chromosomal assignment of BCD1 by
Southern blot analysis of human/rodent somatic cell hybrids that contain
a single chromosome or several different human chromosomes in one or
more hybrid cell lines. The assignment to chromosome 10 was confirmed
and refined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), which
localized the gene to 10p15-p14. By FISH, Onyango et al. (1998) further
refined the map position to 10p15. By the same method, Ratziu et al.
(1998) assigned the ZF9 gene to 10p.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Narla et al. (2001) demonstrated that KLF6 is mutated in a subset of
human prostate cancer. Loss of heterozygosity analysis revealed that 1
KLF6 allele is deleted in 77% (17 of 22) of primary prostate tumors.
Sequence analysis of the retained KLF6 allele revealed mutations in 71%
of these tumors. Functional studies confirmed that whereas wildtype KLF6
upregulates p21 (WAF1/CIP1; 116899) in a p53-independent manner and
significantly reduces cell proliferation, tumor-derived KLF6 mutants do
not. Furthermore, Narla et al. (2001) demonstrated that separate
malignant foci within prostate cancers from the same patient contained
different KLF6 mutations. Narla et al. (2001) observed that 18 of 33
prostate tumors had KLF6 mutations. Of the 26 mutations identified, 23
were within the KLF6 transactivation domain. These mutations resulted in
25 nonconservative amino acid changes and the introduction of a
premature stop codon. None of these mutations was present in the
patient's normal prostate tissue DNA or in germline DNA from 100
chromosomes of 50 unaffected, unrelated individuals. The majority of the
mutations affected highly conserved amino acids, suggesting that these
residues are functionally important.

In a set of 80 sporadic gastric cancers, Cho et al. (2005) identified 4
missense mutations in exon 2 of the KLF6 gene (see, e.g., 602053.0006);
the mutations were absent from corresponding normal tissue, suggesting
somatic mutation. In addition, 16 (43.2%) of 37 informative cases showed
allelic loss at the KLF6 locus. All of the cases with mutation and 13 of
the 16 with allelic loss were of advanced intestinal-type gastric cancer
with lymph node metastasis.

tumor as well as loss of heterozygosity for the wildtype KLF6 allele.
These mutations were not identified in the germline.

deletion of the other KLF6 allele.

In a tumor of a patient with prostate cancer (176807), Narla et al.
(2001) identified a T-to-C transition in the KLF6 gene resulting in a
leucine-to-proline substitution at residue 169 (L169P). The tumor also
had loss of the other KLF6 allele.

In tumor tissue from a sporadic gastric cancer of the intestinal type

transversion in exon 2 of the KLF6 gene, resulting in a ser155-to-arg
(S155R) substitution in the transactivation domain. The mutation was not
found in corresponding normal tissue, suggestive of somatic mutation.

148043	TITLE *148043 KERATIN 3; KRT3
;;K3;;
CYTOKERATIN 3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cytokeratins (keratins) comprise a large family of peptides that combine
to form the intermediate filaments (10-nm fibers) present in the
cytoskeleton in epithelial cells. Type I cytokeratins are acidic and
range from molecular weight 40 to 56.5 kD, whereas type II cytokeratins
are neutral or basic and have molecular weights of 53 to 67 kD. Specific
pairs of heterotypic keratin chains are coexpressed during the various
stages of epithelial differentiation. This pattern of expression of
cytokeratin pairs implies the existence of highly coordinated control of
transcription. The gene for cytokeratin 3 (KRT3), a member of the type
II subfamily, is expressed together with KRT12 (601687) during
'corneal-type' differentiation (Moll et al., 1982; Schermer et al.,
1986; summary by Raimondi et al., 1994).

GENE STRUCTURE

The KRT3 gene is approximately 6.5 kb long and encodes one of the
largest cytokeratin proteins (64 kD) (summary by Raimondi et al., 1994).

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Raimondi et al. (1994) mapped the
KRT3 gene to chromosome 12q12-q13. All type II keratin genes mapped to
that time had been assigned to chromosome 12 where they appeared to be
organized into one homotypic cluster.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Meesmann corneal dystrophy (122100) is an autosomal dominant disorder
characterized by fragility of the anterior corneal epithelium where the
KRT12 and KRT3 genes are specifically expressed. Cytoplasmic densities
demonstrated in Meesmann corneal dystrophy (Tremblay and Dube, 1982) are
reminiscent of the tonofilament clumping seen in other dominant keratin
disorders. Furthermore, in K12 knockout mice, a complete loss of the
K3/K12 cytoskeleton results in extreme fragility of corneal
keratinocytes (Kao et al., 1996). Irvine et al. (1997) postulated that
dominant-negative mutations in keratins K3 and K12 might cause Meesmann
corneal dystrophy. They indeed found such mutations. In a Northern
Ireland family they demonstrated linkage between KRT3 and this form of
corneal dystrophy and demonstrated a specific mutation, E509K
(148043.0001), in the KRT3 gene.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MEESMANN CORNEAL DYSTROPHY
KRT3, GLU509LYS

In a family in Northern Ireland, Irvine et al. (1997) demonstrated that
members with Meesmann corneal dystrophy (MECD; 122100) were heterozygous
for a 1525G-A transition in the KRT3 gene, resulting in a glu509-to-lys
(E509K) substitution. This purine transition was a potential CpG
deamination mutation. An identical CpG mutation in the analogous residue
of the KRT2 gene (600194) is the most frequent cause of ichthyosis
bullosa of Siemens (146800).

607698	TITLE *607698 LIGAND-DEPENDENT NUCLEAR RECEPTOR COREPRESSOR; LCOR
;;MBLK1-RELATED PROTEIN 2; MLR2;;
KIAA1795
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

LCOR is a transcriptional corepressor widely expressed in fetal and
adult tissues that is recruited to agonist-bound nuclear receptors
through a single LxxLL motif, also referred to as a nuclear receptor
(NR) box (Fernandes et al., 2003).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2001) cloned LCOR, which they called KIAA1795.
The deduced KIAA1795 protein contains 572 amino acids. RT-PCR followed
by ELISA detected highest expression in liver, testis, and ovary,
followed by kidney and brain. Within brain, highest expression was
detected in amygdala, corpus callosum, and caudate nucleus.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a fetal kidney cDNA library using the
ligand-binding domain of ESR1 (133430) as bait, followed by screening a
prostate cDNA library and searching EST databases, Fernandes et al.
(2003) cloned LCOR. The predicted 433-amino acid LCOR protein has a
calculated molecular mass of approximately 47 kD. It contains an LxxLL
motif, a nuclear localization signal, and a helix-loop-helix domain.
Northern blot analysis detected broad expression of LCOR transcripts at
varying levels in human adult and fetal tissues, with highest expression
in placenta, cerebellum and corpus callosum of brain, adult kidney, and
a number of fetal tissues.

Kunieda et al. (2003) cloned mouse Lcor, which they called Mlr2, based
on its homology with the honeybee transcription factor Mblk1. The
deduced 433-amino acid protein contains a DNA-binding motif and a motif
conserved in Mlr1 (LCORL; 611799). Northern blot analysis detected
expression of Mlr2 in mouse kidney, liver, and heart, with weak
expression in brain and no expression in testis.

GENE FUNCTION

Fernandes et al. (2003) determined that binding of LCOR to ESR1 depends
in part on residues in the coactivator-binding pocket of ESR1 distinct
from those bound by TIF2 (601993). Repression by LCOR could be abolished
by histone deacetylase (HDAC; see 601241) inhibitor trichostatin A in a
receptor-dependent fashion, indicating HDAC-dependent and -independent
modes of action. LCOR bound directly to specific HDACs in vitro and in
vivo. Moreover, LCOR was shown to function by recruiting
C-terminal-binding protein (CTBP; see 602618) corepressors through 2
consensus binding motifs and to colocalize with CTBPs in the nucleus.
Fernandes et al. (2003) concluded that LCOR represents a class of
corepressor that attenuates agonist-activated nuclear receptor signaling
by multiple mechanisms.

Using a reporter gene assay, Kunieda et al. (2003) showed that mouse
Mlr2 bound and activated transcription from the DNA element recognized
by honeybee Mblk1.

GENE STRUCTURE

Fernandes et al. (2003) determined that the LCOR gene contains 7 exons,
including 4 short 5-prime untranslated region exons that contain several
in-frame stop codons.

MAPPING

Nagase et al. (2001) mapped the LCOR gene to chromosome 10 by radiation
hybrid analysis. By genomic sequence analysis, Fernandes et al. (2003)
mapped the LCOR gene to chromosome 10q24.1.

168840	TITLE *168840 PROLINE-RICH PROTEIN, BstNI SUBFAMILY, 3; PRB3
;;PAROTID SALIVARY GLYCOPROTEIN; G1;;
BASIC SALIVARY PROLINE-RICH PROTEIN, BstNI TYPE, 3
DESCRIPTION For background information on salivary proline-rich proteins, see PRB1
(180989).

Azen et al. (1978) found 5 alleles. Linkage with Pr, Db, and Pa was
indicated by linkage disequilibrium. These genes presumably arose by
gene duplication, in view of the structural similarity of the gene
products. They play an important role in inhibiting calcium phosphate
precipitation from saliva and the glycoprotein forms part of the
acquired dental pellicle and plaque. On the basis of relative degrees of
linkage disequilibrium, Azen and Denniston (1980) favored positioning of
G1 'outside' Db, to give suggested gene order Pa-Pr-Db-G1. Ikemoto et
al. (1979) delineated a polymorphic salivary glycoprotein they
symbolized Ph (salivary parotid heavy protein). The relation to G1 of
Azen et al. (1978) was not known. According to the hypothesis of Maeda
(1985), as outlined in 168730, 6 loci constituting 2 gene subfamilies
code the salivary proline-rich proteins. One subfamily, with 2 genes,
codes the acidic proteins; the genes are rich in HaeIII restriction
sites and are designated PRH1 and PRH2. The other subfamily, with 4
loci, codes the basic proteins; the genes are rich in BstNI restriction
sites and are designated PRB1, PRB2, PRB3, and PRB4. Maeda (1985)
concluded that the gene she designated PRB3 probably codes G1. Which
ones of the other basic proline-rich proteins are coded by PRB1, 2 and 4
is not yet certain. Sequencing and restriction mapping indicate that the
PRP cluster is in a segment of DNA about 500 kb long (Maeda, 1985).
There is no information on the order and linkage relationships of the 6
genes. The 2 genes PRH1 (168730) and PRH2 (168790) have been completely
sequenced (Kim and Maeda, 1986). The sequence information confirms the
allelic relationship of Db, Pa, and PIF.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PRB3S(CYS)
PRB3, ARG15CYS

In the saliva of an Ashkenazi Jew, Azen et al. (1990) established
compound heterozygosity for a null mutation and a missense mutation. The
missense mutation was a CGT-to-TGT (arg-to-cys) change at nucleotide 45
in the tandemly repetitious exon 3 (the major protein-coding portion).
Azen et al. (1990) referred to this missense mutation as the PRB3S(cys)
allele and concluded that it accounts for the disulfide-bonded and
peroxidase-modifying properties of the G1-8 variant. The G1-8 protein
variant was found in Ashkenazi Jews with a gene frequency of
approximately 0.008 but was not found in the general Caucasian, black,
or Japanese populations. Both G1-8, coded by the PRB3 locus, and Pa-1,
coded by the PRH1 locus, are disulfide bonded and probably modify
salivary peroxidase (part of an important intraoral antibacterial
system) through formation of disulfide-bonded heterodimers.

.0002
PRB3M(NULL)
PRB3, 1-BP INS

In the Ashkenazi Jew in whom Azen et al. (1990) found compound
heterozygosity for mutations at the PRB3 locus (see 168840.0001), one of
the alleles was identified as a null allele resulting from a single
nucleotide insertion that led to a frameshift and a premature
termination codon. Null alleles are frequent at PRP loci, apparently
because of an intragenic unequal crossover.

;;SNM1, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; SNM1;;
SNM1, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF, A; SNM1A;;
KIAA0086
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DNA interstrand cross-links prevent strand separation, thereby
physically blocking transcription, replication, and segregation of DNA.
DCLRE1A is one of several evolutionarily conserved genes involved in
repair of interstrand cross-links (Dronkert et al., 2000).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human immature
myeloid cell line cDNA library, Nagase et al. (1995) cloned DCLRE1A,
which they called KIAA0086. The deduced 1,040-amino acid protein shares
33.3% identity over 192 amino acids with the S. cerevisiae DNA repair
protein Snm1. Northern blot analysis detected expression in all tissues
and cell lines examined except peripheral blood leukocytes.

Dronkert et al. (2000) determined that human DCLRE1A, which they called
SNM1, contains a nuclear localization signal and a zinc finger motif in
its N-terminal half and 8 motifs shared with SNM1-like proteins of
various species in its C-terminal half. Fluorescence-tagged SNM1
localized to nuclei of transfected human fibroblasts and Chinese hamster
ovary cells, but it was excluded from nucleoli.

Using Northern blot analysis, Richie et al. (2002) detected a 4.5-kb
SNM1 transcript in all tissues examined, with highest expression in
pancreas and brain. Fluorescence-tagged SNM1 localized to the nucleus of
individual transfected HeLa and human breast carcinoma cells in 3
distinct patterns: diffuse nuclear staining, multiple nuclear foci, or 1
or 2 larger nuclear bodies.

GENE FUNCTION

Dronkert et al. (2000) found that cells overexpressing human SNM1
underwent morphologic changes consistent with apoptosis a few days after
SNM1 introduction.

Richie et al. (2002) found that exposure of cells to ionizing radiation
or to an interstrand cross-linking agent altered the pattern of SNM1
nuclear localization. Under these conditions, the number of cells
exhibiting SNM1 bodies decreased and the population of cells with SNM1
foci increased. Immunofluorescence studies indicated that SNM1
colocalized with 53BP1 (TP53BP1; 605230) before and after exposure to
ionizing radiation, and coimmunoprecipitation assays confirmed the
interaction. SNM1 foci formed after ionizing radiation were largely
coincident with foci formed by MRE11 (MRE11A; 600814) and to a lesser
extent with those formed by BRCA1 (113705), but not with those formed by
RAD51 (179617). Focus formation by SNM1 did not require ATM (607585).

GENE STRUCTURE

Demuth and Digweed (1998) determined that the DCLRE1A gene contains 9
exons and spans about 20 kb. The upstream region contains a GC box, but
no TATA box, and has 1 SP1 (189906) site, 3 AP1 (see JUN; 165160) sites,
4 AP4 (TFAP4; 600743) sites, and 1 NFKB (see 164011) site.

MAPPING

By examining a panel of human-rodent hybrid cell lines, Nagase et al.
(1995) mapped the DCLRE1A gene to chromosome 10.

ANIMAL MODEL

Dronkert et al. (2000) found that Snm1 -/- mice were viable and fertile
and showed no major abnormalities, but they were hypersensitive to
mitomycin C compared with wildtype mice. Snm1 -/- mouse embryonic stem
cells grew at a rate comparable to wildtype stem cells, but they were
2-fold more sensitive to mitomycin C. Mutant and wildtype stem cells
showed the same sensitivity to other DNA interstrand cross-linking
agents, ultraviolet irradiation, and gamma irradiation.

;;SEROTONIN 5-HT-1D RECEPTOR;;
5-@HYDROXYTRYPTAMINE RECEPTOR 1D-ALPHA; HTR1DA;;
RDC4
DESCRIPTION The serotonin 1D receptor was initially characterized by radioligand
binding procedures using membranes derived from bovine caudate nucleus.
The 5-HT-1D receptor is known to be a G protein-coupled receptor.
Sumatriptan, an agent effective in the treatment of acute migraine, is
the only ligand yet identified that is selective for the 5-HT-1D
receptor. Weinshank et al. (1992) reported the cloning, deduced amino
acid sequences, pharmacologic properties, and second-messenger coupling
of a pair of human 5-HT-1D receptor genes, which they designated alpha
and beta due to their strong similarities. Both genes have no introns in
their coding regions, are expressed in the human cerebral cortex, and
can couple to inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity. Their
pharmacologic binding properties match closely those of human, bovine,
and guinea pig 5-HT-1D sites. Libert et al. (1991) obtained cDNA clones
encoding 4 receptors of the G protein-coupled receptor family by
selective amplification and cloning from thyroid cDNA. One of these
clones, termed RDC4 by them, showed close structural similarity with the
serotonin 5HT1A receptor (109760). By in situ hybridization, they
demonstrated that the gene (HTR1D) is located on chromosome 1 at
1p36.3-p34.3. By Southern blot analysis of a hybrid cell panel, Jin et
al. (1992) showed that the HTR1D gene is located on chromosome 1. Wilkie
et al. (1993) showed that the homologous gene in the mouse is located on
chromosome 4.
