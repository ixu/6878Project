614194	TITLE *614194 DEDICATOR OF CYTOKINESIS 6; DOCK6
;;KIAA1395
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DOCK6 is a member of the conserved DOCK family of atypical guanine
nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that lack a catalytic DBL (MCF2;
311030) homology domain. DOCK6 belongs to subfamily C of the DOCK family
and has a role in remodeling the actin cytoskeleton by functioning as a
GEF for both CDC42 (116952) and RAC1 (602048) Miyamoto et al. (2007).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned DOCK6, which they designated
KIAA1395. The deduced protein contains 1,628 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected variable DOCK6 expression in all adult and fetal tissues and
adult brain regions examined, with highest expression in ovary, lung,
heart, and kidney, and lowest expression in spleen.

By searching a database for sequences similar to DOCK180 (DOCK1;
601403), Cote and Vuori (2002) identified DOCK6. The deduced protein
contains an N-terminal domain of over 200 amino acids and a C-terminal
domain of over 500 amino acids that share significant similarity with
other DOCK proteins. Cote and Vuori (2002) called these regions DOCK
homology region-1 (DHR1) and DHR2, respectively. DHR2 was predicted to
function in guanine nucleotide exchange.

Miyamoto et al. (2007) found that transfected COS-7 cells expressed
epitope-tagged human DOCK6 DHR2 near the cell surface and in the
perinuclear region. Western blot analysis of mouse N1E-115 neuroblastoma
cells showed that full-length mouse Dock6 had an apparent molecular mass
of 200 kD.

By quantitative RT-PCR of adult mouse tissues, Shaheen et al. (2011)
detected highest Dock6 expression in lung and heart, with lower
expression in brain, cerebellum, eye, kidney, liver, and spleen. In situ
hybridization of mouse embryos showed that Dock6 was expressed in the
growing edge of limb buds and in heart at embryonic day 9.5. By
embryonic day 13.5, Dock6 expression was more concentrated in developing
digits.

GENE STRUCTURE

Shaheen et al. (2011) determined that the DOCK6 gene contains 48 exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the DOCK6 gene
to chromosome 19. Hartz (2011) mapped the DOCK6 gene to chromosome
19p13.2 based on an alignment of the DOCK6 sequence (GenBank GENBANK
AB037816) with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

Using full-length human DOCK6 or the isolated DHR2 of DOCK6 expressed in
E. coli, Miyamoto et al. (2007) showed that DOCK6 functioned as a GEF
for RAC1 and CDC42, but not for RHOA (165390). Similar to other DOCK
proteins, the isolated DHR2 of DOCK6 showed higher activity than
full-length DOCK6. Transfection of COS-7 cells with human DOCK6 DHR2
increased the number of cells displaying both lamellipodia and
filopodia, which are markers of Rac1 and Cdc42 activation, respectively.
Dock6 mRNA and protein were induced upon differentiation in mouse
N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells, concomitant with increased levels of
GTP-bound Rac1 and Cdc42. Overexpression of human DOCK6 DHR2 promoted
neurite outgrowth in N1E-115 cells. Conversely, knockdown of endogenous
Dock6 in N1E-115 cells inhibited neurite outgrowth after induction of
differentiation. Miyamoto et al. (2007) concluded that DOCK6 functions
as a GEF for RAC1 and CDC42 and has a role in cytoskeletal remodeling
and neurite outgrowth.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 unrelated Arab girls with autosomal recessive Adams-Oliver
syndrome-2 (AOS2; 614219), Shaheen et al. (2011) identified homozygosity
for 2 different truncating mutations in the DOCK6 gene (614194.0001 and
614194.0002, respectively) that segregated with disease in each family.

In affected individuals from 2 consanguineous Arab families with AOS who
shared a region of homozygosity overlapping the DOCK6 gene, Shaheen et
al. (2013) identified homozygous mutations in DOCK6 (614914.0003 and
614914.0004, respectively).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ADAMS-OLIVER SYNDROME 2
DOCK6, 4-BP DEL, 1362AACT

In an 11-month-old Arab girl with Adams-Oliver syndrome-2 (AOS2;
614219), born of double first-cousin parents, Shaheen et al. (2011)
identified homozygosity for a 4-bp deletion (1362delAACT) in the DOCK6
gene, predicted to result in a mutant protein lacking the 2 fundamental
domains, DHR1 and DHR2. Her unaffected parents were heterozygous for the
mutation. Examination of cytoskeletal organization in patient
fibroblasts showed that approximately 16% of cells assumed a rounded
phenotype that was not observed in control cells; patient cells also
assumed an unusual elongated morphology and lacked lamellipodia and
lateral ruffles.

.0002
ADAMS-OLIVER SYNDROME 2
DOCK6, 1-BP DUP, 1245T

In a 3.5-year-old Arab girl with Adams-Oliver syndrome-2 (614219), born
of unaffected first-cousin parents, Shaheen et al. (2011) identified
homozygosity for a 1-bp duplication (1245dupT) in the DOCK6 gene,
predicted to result in a mutant protein lacking the 2 fundamental
domains, DHR1 and DHR2. The mutation segregated with disease in the
family.

.0003
ADAMS-OLIVER SYNDROME 2
DOCK6, 1-BP DUP, 2520T

In a 12-month old Arab boy with Adams-Oliver syndrome (AOS2; 614219),
born of first-cousin parents, Shaheen et al. (2013) identified
homozygosity for a 1-bp duplication (c.2520dupT) in the DOCK6 gene,
resulting in a frameshift and introduction of a premature termination
codon (Arg841SerfsTer6). The patient's affected sister exhibited
gastroschisis in addition to other features of AOS.

.0004
ADAMS-OLIVER SYNDROME 2
DOCK6, IVS32AS, G-C, -1

In a 2-year-old girl Arab girl with Adams-Oliver syndrome (AOS2;
614219), born of first-cousin parents, Shaheen et al. (2013) identified
homozygosity for a c.4107-1G-C transversion at the splice acceptor site
in intron 32 of the DOCK6 gene. RT-PCR confirmed that the mutation
replaces the consensus acceptor site by a cryptic site in the downstream
exon (exon 33), leading to the loss of 7 bp from exon 33 and causing a
frameshift that results in a premature termination codon
(Thr1370MetfsTer19).

;;2-@HYDROXYPHYTANOYL-CoA LYASE;;
2-@HPCL;;
HPCL2
DESCRIPTION In the third step of the alpha-oxidation of 3-methyl-branched fatty
acids such as phytanic acid, a 2-hydroxy-3-methylacyl-CoA is cleaved
into formyl-CoA and a 2-methyl-branched fatty aldehyde. Foulon et al.
(1999) purified the cleavage enzyme from the matrix protein fraction of
rat liver peroxisomes and found that it is a protein composed of 4
identical 63-kD subunits. The enzyme's activity proved to depend on
Mg(2+) and thiamine pyrophosphate, a hitherto unrecognized cofactor of
alpha-oxidation. Formyl-CoA and 2-methylpentadecanal were identified as
reaction products when the purified enzyme was incubated with
2-hydroxy-3-methylhexadecanoyl-CoA as the substrate. Hence, the enzyme
catalyzes a carbon-carbon cleavage, and Foulon et al. (1999) designated
it 2-hydroxyphytanoyl-CoA lyase, or 2-HPCL. Sequences derived from
tryptic peptides of the purified rat protein were used as queries to
recover human ESTs. The composite cDNA sequence of the human lyase
contained an open reading frame encoding a predicted 578-amino acid
polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 63,732 Da. Recombinant
human protein expressed in mammalian cells exhibited lyase activity.
2-HPCL displays homology to a putative C. elegans protein that resembles
bacterial oxalyl-CoA decarboxylases. Similar to the decarboxylases, a
thiamine pyrophosphate-binding consensus domain is present in the
C-terminal part of 2-HPCL. Although neither peroxisome targeting
signal-1 nor -2 were apparent, transfection experiments with constructs
encoding green fluorescent protein fused to the full-length lyase or its
C-terminal pentapeptide indicated that the C terminus of 2-HPCL
represents a peroxisome targeting signal-1 variant.

;;RETINOIC ACID-INDUCED 3; RAI3;;
RETINOIC ACID-INDUCIBLE GENE 1; RAIG1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute a large superfamily of
proteins that transmit signals from extracellular messenger molecules
and sensory stimuli to intracellular signaling pathways. GPRC5A belongs
to the glutamate receptor subfamily of GPCRs (Bjarnadottir et al.,
2005).

CLONING

Retinoids affect many fundamental cellular processes, including
embryogenesis, cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis, and they
exert significant preventive and therapeutic effects against human
cancer. Using differential display to identify retinoic acid-regulated
genes from a human oral squamous carcinoma cell line, Cheng and Lotan
(1998) isolated a cDNA corresponding to a novel retinoic acid-induced
gene, which they named RAIG1. RAIG1 expression was induced by
all-trans-retinoic acid rapidly and in a dose-dependent manner. The
levels of RAIG1 mRNA in different cancer cells varied greatly, with no
correlation between the expression levels and the type of cancer cells.
RAIG1 was expressed in several normal human tissues, with highest
expression levels in fetal and adult lung. Northern blot analysis
detected RAIG1 transcripts of 2.4 and 6.8 kb; the authors stated that
these likely result from the alternative use of different
polyadenylation sites. RAIG1 encodes a deduced 357-amino acid protein
with a calculated molecular mass of 40,256 Da. It contains 7 predicted
transmembrane domains, which is a signature motif of the GPCR
superfamily, and a potential N-linked glycosylation site.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bjarnadottir et al. (2005) determined that the GPRC5A gene contains 3
exons.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid and YAC contig mapping, Cheng and Lotan (1998)
localized the GPRC5A gene to chromosome 12p13-p12.3, between markers
D12S358 and D12S847.

By genomic sequence analysis, Bjarnadottir et al. (2005) mapped the
GPRC5A gene to chromosome 12p13.1. They mapped the mouse Gprc5a gene to
chromosome 6.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Vetter and Wurst (2001) cloned mouse Uqcc, which they called Bfzb, and
identified its human homolog by database analysis. The deduced human and
mouse proteins have a single transmembrane domain and share 94% amino
acid identity. In situ hybridization of mouse embryos detected Bfzb
predominantly in the developing nervous system, with highest expression
in proliferating neuroepithelia of brain and neural tube, ganglia of
cranial nerves V, VII, VIII, IX, and X, and dorsal root ganglia.
Transcripts were also detected in developing eye and brown fat. In adult
mouse brain, strong expression was restricted to olfactory bulb,
hippocampus, and piriform cortex and Purkinje cells of cerebellum. The
Bfzb protein localized to cytoplasmic vesicular structures.

MAPPING

Hartz (2008) mapped the UQCC gene to chromosome 20q11.22 based on an
alignment of the UQCC sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK001712) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

;;GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE-RELEASING FACTOR 2; GRF2;;
CRK SH3-BINDING GNRP; C3G
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By Far Western screening of a human spleen lambda-gt11 expression
library using the SH3 domain of CRK (164762) as probe, Tanaka et al.
(1994) isolated a cDNA clone corresponding to RAPGEF1, which they called
C3G. Additional clones from human spleen and placenta cDNA libraries
were obtained by plaque hybridization with the (32)P-labeled spleen cDNA
clone. The deduced 1,077-amino acid protein has a predicted molecular
mass of 121 kD and contains a central proline-rich SH3-binding domain
and a C-terminal region homologous to guanine nucleotide-releasing
proteins (GNRP) for RAS, such as RASGRF1 (606600) and SOS1 (182530).
Northern blot analysis of human adult and fetal tissues detected a
7.5-kb transcript in all tissues examined with highest expression in
skeletal muscle, placenta, and fetal heart and brain.

GENE FUNCTION

Tanaka et al. (1994) showed that CRK and C3G coimmunoprecipitated in
transfected rabbit kidney cells. Deletion analysis showed that the CRK
SH3 domain interacted with a 50-amino acid proline-rich sequence in C3G.
The authors suggested that the complex of C3G and CRK or C3G and
GRB2/ASH (108355) transduces signals from tyrosine kinases to RAS in a
number of different tissues.

The RAS-CRK-RAP1 (179520) cellular signal transduction system is
regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). Transcription
of C3G is activated by the CRK adaptor protein. Hirata et al. (2004)
documented the amplification of C3G in 5 of 18 primary nonsmall cell
lung cancers examined and its increased expression in 18 of 28 tumors in
comparison to corresponding noncancerous lung tissues. The data were
interpreted as indicating that amplification and increased expression of
the C3G gene may play some role in human lung carcinogenesis through
derangement of the CRK-RAP1 signaling pathway.

MAPPING

Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, Takai et al. (1994) mapped the
RAPGEF1 gene to chromosome 9q34.3, where chromosomal changes have been
reported in human hematopoietic malignancies.

;;DOCKING PROTEIN, 56-KD;;
p56DOK
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML; 608232) is characterized by the
presence of the Philadelphia chromosome translocation t(9;22) and the
resulting p210-bcr/abl chimeric protein-tyrosine kinase (see 151410). Di
Cristofano et al. (1998) described the purification, cloning, and
characterization of a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein, p56dok (DOK2),
from a megakaryoblastic cell line expressing p210-bcr/abl (Mo/p210). The
DOK2 cDNA clone encodes a 412-amino acid protein with a molecular mass
of 53 to 56 kD. The DOK2 protein has a potential pleckstrin homology
(PH) domain at the N terminus, 13 potential tyrosine phosphorylation
sites, 6 PXXP motifs, and 2 YXXPXD motifs (predicted Ras-GAP (139150)
SH2 domain binding sites). It shares 34.8% overall amino acid identity
with another tyrosine-phosphorylated protein, p62dok (DOK1; 602919),
which also contains a predicted PH domain at its N terminus. Di
Cristofano et al. (1998) defined a DOK homology sequence motif within 50
amino acids of the central core region of the proteins. Northern blot
analysis revealed that both DOK1 and DOK2 are highly expressed in cells
and tissues of hematopoietic origin as well as in lung.

MAPPING

Berger et al. (2010) stated that the DOK2 gene maps to chromosome
8p21.3.

GENE FUNCTION

Immunoprecipitation experiments by Di Cristofano et al. (1998) showed
that expression of bcr/abl induces additional tyrosine phosphorylation
of the DOK1 and DOK2 proteins and their association with Ras-GAP. The
authors speculated that DOK association regulates GAP activity toward
Ras and that the DOK proteins serve as mediators of bcr-abl signaling.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yasuda et al. (2004) generated mice lacking Dok1 and/or Dok2 and found
that double-knockout mice succumbed to myeloproliferative disease
resembling human CML and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. The
double-knockout mice had medullary and extramedullary hyperplasia of
granulocyte/macrophage progenitors with leukemic potential, and their
myeloid cells showed hyperproliferation and hypoapoptosis upon treatment
with and deprivation of cytokines, respectively. Cytokine stimulation
enhanced Erk (see 176872) and Akt (see 164730) activation in mutant
myeloid cells. Yasuda et al. (2004) concluded that DOK1 and DOK2 are key
negative regulators of cytokine responses and are essential for myeloid
homeostasis and leukemia suppression.

Independently, Niki et al. (2004) observed aberrant hemopoiesis and
CML-like lymphoproliferative disease in Dok1 and Dok2 double-knockout
mice. Single-knockout mice displayed normal steady-state hemopoiesis.

Shinohara et al. (2005) found that macrophages from mice lacking Dok1 or
Dok2 displayed elevated activation of Erk (MAPK3; 601795), but not other
MAPKs or Nfkb (see 164011), upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide
(LPS), but not other Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, resulting in
hyperproduction of Tnf (190160) and nitric oxide. LPS also induced high
Tnf production in vivo in mice lacking Dok1 or Dok2. Forced expression
of Dok1 or Dok2 in macrophages inhibited LPS-induced Erk activation and
Tnf production, but not if Dok1 had a tyr336-to-phe or tyr340-to-phe
mutation. Shinohara et al. (2005) concluded that DOK1 and DOK2 are
essential negative regulators downstream of TLR4 (603030).

Berger et al. (2010) found that mice with knockout of Dok1, Dok2, or
Dok3 (611435) each developed lung adenocarcinoma (211980). Mice with
double-knockouts of different combinations of these 3 genes developed
lung adenocarcinoma at an earlier age and with high penetrance,
suggesting that the proteins have partially redundant or overlapping
functions. Compared to wildtype lung tissue, Dok-mutant tumors showed
moderate staining for phosphorylated Akt and strong staining for
phosphorylated Erk. Immunohistochemical studies on isolated cells showed
that the tumor cells arose from a population of bronchioalveolar stem
cells with inactivation of the Dok proteins. These findings were
consistent with a model of tumorigenesis in which inactivation of the
Dok1, Dok2, and Dok3 genes leads to hyperactivation of Akt and Erk, and
an expansion of the stem cells that differentiate into alveolar type II
cells. Among 199 primary human lung adenocarcinoma samples, 37% showed a
deletion of 1 copy of DOK2, and the loss correlated with loss of protein
expression. In Dok-mutant mice, haploinsufficiency of Dok2 was
sufficient for tumor formation, as the wildtype allele was retained in
most tumor samples. Berger et al. (2010) concluded that the findings
were consistent for a tumor-suppressor role for DOK2 in human lung
cancer.

612276	TITLE *612276 YRDC DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN; YRDC
;;YRDC, E. COLI, HOMOLOG OF;;
ISCHEMIA/REPERFUSION-INDUCIBLE PROTEIN; IRIP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of a human fetal brain library using RBBP9
(602908) as bait, followed by EST database analysis and RACE, Chen et
al. (2003) cloned YRDC. The deduced 279-amino acid protein contains a
SUA5-YCIO-YRDC domain, a GTP-binding elongation factor signature, and a
leucine zipper motif. YRDC shares 90% amino acid identity with its mouse
ortholog and is highly conserved over its SUA5-YCIO-YRDC domain from E.
coli to human. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.5-kb transcript in
all human tissues examined with highest expression in liver, brain, and
pancreas. Jiang et al. (2005) determined that YRDC has a calculated
molecular mass of 28.3 kD. They identified YRDC transcripts of 1.9 and
1.2 kb that differ by alternate polyadenylation sites.

By differential display analysis of ischemia/reperfusion-treated mouse
kidney RNA, Jiang et al. (2005) identified mouse Yrdc, which they called
Irip. The deduced 263-amino acid mouse protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 27.8 kD. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.4-kb
transcript in mouse tissues with strong expression in testis, thyroid,
ovary, colon, kidney, and brain. Subcellular fractionation and Western
blot analysis localized Yrdc to the plasma membrane fraction of mouse
kidney tissue.

GENE FUNCTION

In a mouse model of LPS-induced endotoxemia, Jiang et al. (2005)
demonstrated that Yrdc showed significantly increased expression in all
tested organs, including lung, liver, and spleen. Yeast 2-hybrid
analysis and immunoprecipitation showed that YRDC interacted with
sodium-glucose cotransporter regulatory protein RS1 (RSC1A1; 601966).
YRDC transfection and overexpression resulted in decreased
1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) transport, and a YRDC-mutant protein
resulted in increased MPP+ transport. Inhibition of YRDC by short
interfering RNA in HeLa cells resulted in increased MPP+ transport, and
YRDC overexpression decreased MPP+ transport mediated by organic cation
transporters OCT2 (SLC22A2; 602608) and OCT3 (SLC22A3; 604842), as well
as by organic anion transporter OAT1 (SLC22A6; 607582) and monoamine
transporters DAT (SLC6A3; 126455), NET (SLC6A2; 163970), and SERT
(SLC6A4; 182138).

GENE STRUCTURE

Chen et al. (2003) determined that the YRDC gene contains 5 exons
spanning 5.2 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Chen et al. (2003) mapped the YRDC gene to
chromosome 1p34.2. Jiang et al. (2005) mapped the corresponding mouse
Yrdc gene to chromosome 4D2.2.

604177	TITLE *604177 RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN L8; RPL8
DESCRIPTION The mammalian ribosome is composed of 4 RNA species (see 180450) and
approximately 80 different proteins (see 180466).

The rat ribosomal protein L8 (Rpl8) associates with 5.8S rRNA, very
likely participates in the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA, and has been
identified as a constituent of the EF2 (130610)-binding site at the
ribosomal subunit interface. By screening a human ovarian granulosa cell
cDNA expression library with antibodies against human follicular fluid
glycoproteins, Hanes et al. (1993) isolated a partial RPL8 cDNA. They
completed the full-length cDNA sequence using PCR. The deduced 257-amino
acid human RPL8 protein is identical to rat Rpl8. Northern blot analysis
detected a 900-bp RPL8 transcript in human granulosa cells and white
blood cells.

By somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid mapping analyses, Kenmochi
et al. (1998) mapped the human RPL8 gene to 8q.

;;CHITINASE, MACROPHAGE; CHIT;;
CHITOTRIOSIDASE;;
METHYLUMBELLIFERYL-TETRA-N-ACETYLCHITOTETRAOSIDE HYDROLASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The CHIT1 gene encodes plasma methylumbelliferyl
tetra-N-acetylchitotetraoside hydrolase (chitotriosidase), a human
chitinase (EC 3.2.1.14). Chitinases play a role in degrading the chitin
walls of some microorganisms (Boot et al., 1995).

CLONING

Renkema et al. (1995) purified and characterized the chitotriosidase
protein from the spleen of a patient with Gaucher disease (230800) who
had increased serum CHIT1 enzyme activity. Two major isoforms with
isoelectric points of 7.2 and 8.0 and molecular masses of 50 and 39 kD,
respectively, were found to have identical N-terminal amino acid
sequences. An antiserum raised against the purified 39-kD
chitotriosidase precipitated all isozymes. The findings suggested that a
single gene encodes the different isoforms of chitotriosidase. The
authors postulated that the enzyme may be involved in defense against
and in degradation of chitin-containing pathogens such as fungi,
nematodes, and insects.

Boot et al. (1995) isolated a cDNA corresponding to the chitotriosidase
gene from a macrophage cDNA library. The deduced 445-amino acid protein
has a molecular mass of 49 kD, similar to the larger isoform detected by
Renkema et al. (1995). Secretion of active chitotriosidase was obtained
after transient transfection of COS-1 cells with the cloned cDNA.
Chitotriosidase contains several regions with high homology to those
present in chitinases from different species belonging to family 18 of
glycosylhydrolases. Northern blot analysis showed that expression of
chitotriosidase mRNA occurred only at a late stage of differentiation of
monocytes to activated macrophages in cell culture. The authors
speculated that the enzyme may play a role in the degradation of
chitin-containing pathogens.

GENE STRUCTURE

Boot et al. (1998) determined that the CHIT1 gene contains 12 exons and
spans about 20 kb.

MAPPING

Eiberg and Den Tandt (1997) mapped the CHIT locus to chromosome
1q31-qter between flanking markers D1S191 and D1S245. By fluorescence in
situ hybridization, Boot et al. (1998) assigned the CHIT gene to
1q31-q32.

GENE FUNCTION

Hollak et al. (1994) observed a very marked increase (more than
600-fold) of chitotriosidase activity in the plasma of 30 of 32
symptomatic patients with type I Gaucher disease (230800), which is due
to mutation in the gene encoding beta-glucosidase (GBA; 606463). The
increase in plasma chitotriosidase that they observed in Gaucher disease
patients was far more pronounced than the increase in alkaline
phosphatase (ALPL; 171760), which had been used as an important
diagnostic hallmark of the disease. Chitotriosidase activity declined
dramatically during enzyme supplementation therapy. In contrast, 3
GBA-deficient individuals without clinical symptoms had only slight
increases in chitotriosidase. The authors considered it unlikely that
chitotriosidase itself contributes to the clinical presentation of
Gaucher disease. Hollak et al. (1994) noted that the similarity between
lysozyme (LYZ; 153450) and chitotriosidase with respect to catalytic
activity toward particular substrates suggested that the latter may also
function in host defense mechanisms, e.g., through cleavage of bacterial
cell wall polysaccharide. Hollak et al. (1994) suggested that the
macrophages loaded with glucosylceramide in Gaucher disease are the main
source of the plasma enzyme activity. No elevation, or only moderate
elevation, of plasma chitotriosidase was found in a variety of
granulomatous immunologic disorders.

Boot et al. (1995) noted that homologous chitinases in plants are known
to defend against fungal pathogens. The bactericidal function of
lysozyme is also well established; nevertheless, in rabbits an inherited
deficiency in lysozyme occurs that seems to have little consequence for
susceptibility to infections. The diverse array of defense mechanisms of
the immune system in mammals probably renders sufficient tolerance to
defects in single enzymes such as lysozyme and chitotriosidase.

By comparing the antifungal properties of human macrophage
chitotriosidase and its isolated domains, Vandevenne et al. (2011)
showed that the catalytic domain was sufficient for antifungal activity
and tended to be more efficient than the intact enzyme. In contrast, the
chitin-binding domain did not possess any antifungal properties.
Mutations in chitotriosidase that rendered the macrophage enzyme
inactive could be compensated by lysozyme, which had even greater
antifungal activity than chitotriosidase, as well as antibacterial
activity.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In individuals with chitotriosidase deficiency (614122), Boot et al.
(1998) identified a homozygous 24-bp duplication in the CHIT1 gene
(600031.0001). The observed carrier frequency of about 35% indicated
that the duplication is the predominant cause of chitotriosidase
deficiency. The presence of the duplication in individuals from various
ethnic backgrounds suggested that this mutation is relatively old.

Grace et al. (2007) noted that the identification of CHIT1 gene
mutations that alter plasma activity is important for the use of this
biomarker to monitor disease activity and therapeutic response in
Gaucher disease. They genotyped the CHIT1 gene in 320 unrelated patients
with Gaucher disease, including 272 of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. Among
all patients, 4% and 37.2% were homozygous and heterozygous,
respectively, for the 24-bp duplication. In addition, Grace et al.
(2007) identified 3 novel mutations in the CHIT1 gene
(600031.0002-600031.0004) in individuals with Gaucher disease and
chitotriosidase deficiency.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CHITOTRIOSIDASE DEFICIENCY
CHIT1, 24-BP DUP

Boot et al. (1998) found that chitotriosidase deficiency (614122) can be
caused by a 24-bp duplication in exon 10 of the CHIT1 gene, resulting in
activation of a cryptic 3-prime splice site, generating an mRNA with an
in-frame deletion of 87 nucleotides. All chitotriosidase-deficient
individuals tested were homozygous for the duplication. Among 171 Dutch
persons, 6.4% were homozygous and 35.1% were heterozygous for the
mutation. Among 68 Ashkenazi Jewish subjects, 5.9% were homozygous and
33.8% were heterozygous. The mutant chitotriosidase is predicted to lack
amino acids 344-372. On the basis of homology with several chitinases
for which the 3-dimensional structure has been resolved by
crystallographic analysis, the authors predicted that the internal
deletion in the mutant chitotriosidase prevents the formation of a
proper barrel conformation, with resulting loss of chitinolytic
activity.

Among a total of 320 unrelated patients with Gaucher disease (232800),
including 272 of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, Grace et al. (2007) found
that 4% and 37.2% were homozygous or heterozygous for the CHIT1 24-bp
dup, respectively. The allele frequency was 0.227.

.0002
CHITOTRIOSIDASE DEFICIENCY
CHIT1, GLY354ARG, LEU385LEU, AND 4-BP DEL

In a Caribbean Hispanic/African type 1 Gaucher disease (230800) patient
with chitotriosidase deficiency (614122), Grace et al. (2007) identified
a complex allele of the CHIT1 gene with 3 different variations in cis: a
1060G-A transition in exon 10 resulting in a gly354-to-arg (G354R)
substitution, a 1155G-A transition in exon 10 resulting in a synonymous
leu385-to-leu (L385L) substitution, and a 4-bp deletion in intron 10
(1156delGTAA). The complex allele was designated 'E/I-10'
(exon/intron-10) allele. The patient was compound heterozygous for the
E/I-10 complex allele and the common 24-bp duplication (600031.0001). In
vitro functional expression studies showed that the complex mutant had
no residual enzyme activity. Further screening identified the complex
allele in individuals of Caribbean Hispanic, Dominican, Caribbean Black,
Puerto Rican, and American Black descent. It was not identified in those
of Caucasian or Ashkenazi Jewish descent.

.0003
CHITOTRIOSIDASE DEFICIENCY
CHIT1, GLU74LYS

In a type I Gaucher disease (230800) patient with chitotriosidase
deficiency (614122), Grace et al. (2007) identified a 220G-A transition
in exon 3 of the CHIT1 gene, resulting in a glu74-to-lys (E74K)
substitution. In vitro functional expression studies showed that the
E74K mutant had 51% activity compared to control values. The E74K allele
was found in 3 (1.4%) of 208 Ashkenazi Jewish alleles, but not in
non-Ashkenazi Jewish alleles, indicating that it is very rare. This
mutation was not found in normal controls.

.0004
CHITOTRIOSIDASE DEFICIENCY
CHIT1, GLY102SER

In 3 Ashkenazi Jewish type I Gaucher disease (230800) patients with
chitotriosidase deficiency (614122), Grace et al. (2007) identified a
304G-A transition in exon 4 of the CHIT1 gene, resulting in a
gly102-to-ser (G102S) substitution. In vitro functional expression
studies showed that the G102S mutant had 23% activity compared to
control values. The G102S allele had a frequency of 0.2 to 0.3 in
various control populations.

;;SCOTIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Zhang et al. (2000) cloned a cDNA encoding Scotin, which they called
HSPC217, from CD34 (142230)-positive hematopoietic stem/progenitor
cells. The deduced 170-amino acid protein contains an MYB (189990)
DNA-binding domain repeat signature. Microarray analysis of 5
hematopoietic cell lines detected low-level expression of Scotin in NB4
and Jurkat cells, but no expression was detected in HL60, K562, and U937
cells.

Bourdon et al. (2002) identified mouse Scotin by differential display of
spleen and thymus of normal and p53 (191170) null mice after gamma
irradiation of whole animals. The induced 1.85-kb transcript encodes a
deduced 235-amino acid protein. By searching an EST database using the
mouse sequence as probe, followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE, Bourdon
et al. (2002) cloned a full-length cDNA encoding Scotin from a placenta
cDNA library. The deduced 240-amino acid human protein shares 70%
identity with mouse Scotin. Both the human and the mouse proteins
contain an N-terminal signal sequence, a central transmembrane domain
composed of 18 hydrophobic amino acids, and a proline/tyrosine domain,
and both show an apparent molecular mass of 25 kD by Western blot
analysis. Immunolocalization of exogenously expressed Scotin revealed
colocalization with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) markers. By mutation
analysis, Bourdon et al. (2002) determined that the proline-rich domain
is required for ER localization.

GENE FUNCTION

Bourdon et al. (2002) noted that mouse thymus and spleen cells underwent
massive p53-dependent apoptosis following ultraviolet irradiation or
exposure to actinomycin D. They found that Scotin mRNA was induced
coincident with apoptosis and was expressed only in spleen and thymus of
irradiated wildtype mice and not in the spleen or thymus of irradiated
p53 null mice. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, they
confirmed direct binding between p53 and Scotin, and using a luciferase
reporter plasmid driven by the mouse Scotin promoter, they confirmed
dose-dependent p53 transactiviation. Furthermore, Bourdon et al. (2002)
showed that the apoptosis induced by the p53/Scotin pathway is caspase
dependent.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Bourdon et al. (2002) determined that the
human Scotin gene contains 6 exons. They identified a p53-responsive
element of 9 decamers within the mouse Scotin promoter.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Zhang et al. (2000) mapped the human
Scotin gene to chromosome 3. By genomic sequence analysis, Bourdon et
al. (2002) mapped the Scotin gene to chromosome 3p21.3. They also
identified a Scotin pseudogene on chromosome Xq13.1-q13.3.

602644	TITLE *602644 TETRASPANIN 4; TSPAN4
;;TRANSMEMBRANE 4 SUPERFAMILY, MEMBER 7; TM4SF7;;
TETRASPAN;;
NOVEL ANTIGEN 2; NAG2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TSPAN4 belongs to the large family of tetraspanins, so named because
they contain 4 transmembrane domains. Tetraspanins are frequently
expressed at the cell surface in association with each other and with
other molecules, such as integrins (see ITGB1; 135630), and they
function to regulate cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and
differentiation (summary by Todd et al., 1998).

CLONING

Tachibana et al. (1997) generated monoclonal antibodies against proteins
that coimmunoprecipitated with CD81 (TAPA1; 186845) from a human breast
cancer cell line. Two antibodies recognized a 28- to 35-kD protein,
which Tachibana et al. (1997) named NAG2 for 'novel antigen-2.' Using
the antibodies to screen a cDNA expression library derived from the
breast cancer cell line, the authors cloned cDNAs encoding NAG2. The
predicted 238-amino acid NAG2 protein contains 4 hydrophobic domains and
shows homology to transmembrane 4 superfamily (TM4SF) proteins. Northern
blot analysis detected a 1.5-kb NAG2 mRNA, and together with flow
cytometry and immunohistochemistry, showed that NAG2 was expressed in
multiple tissues but was absent in brain, lymphoid cells, and platelets.
Immunofluorescence analysis showed that NAG2 colocalized with CD81 on
the cell surface. Tachibana et al. (1997) identified mouse ESTs encoding
the mouse homolog of NAG2. The human and mouse NAG2 proteins have 95%
amino acid identity.

By searching an EST database for sequences containing a tetraspanin
consensus sequence, Todd et al. (1998) identified human TSPAN4. The
deduced 238-amino acid protein contains 4 transmembrane domains and
other features characteristic of tetraspanins, including conservation of
charged residues in or near the transmembrane domains, similar to ion
channels, and of 4 cysteines in the second extracellular domain.
Northern blot analysis detected highest TSPAN4 expression in heart and
placenta. EST database analysis suggested that TSPAN4 is also expressed
in brain, melanocytes, pancreas, and fetal liver/spleen, in addition to
pregnant uterus and adult and fetal heart.

GENE FUNCTION

Tachibana et al. (1997) found that NAG2 coimmunoprecipitated with
integrins and other TM4SF members, indicating that NAG2 is present in
TM4SF-TM4SF and TM4SF-integrin complexes.

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the TSPAN4 gene to chromosome 11p15.5 based on an
alignment of the TSPAN4 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF022813) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

602854	TITLE *602854 PROTEASOME SUBUNIT, ALPHA-TYPE, 1; PSMA1
;;PROTEASOME SUBUNIT NU;;
HC2;;
PROS30
DESCRIPTION DeMartino et al. (1991) cloned the PSMA1 gene, termed 'subunit nu' by
them. The cDNA encoded a 263-amino acid polypeptide. The calculated and
observed molecular masses are 29.5 kD and 35 kD, respectively. Northern
blot analysis revealed an 1.4-kb mRNA in human placenta and HeLa cells.
Coux et al. (1996) noted that 2 proteins, HC2 (29.5 kD) and Pros30 (30.2
kD), are encoded by the PSMA1 gene.

Coux et al. (1996) reviewed the structures and functions of the 20S
proteasome subunits. The alpha subunits comprise the outer rings of the
proteasome. Some alpha subunits contain a functional nuclear
localization signal; proteasomes are found in both the nuclear and
cytoplasmic compartments of the cell. Alpha subunits may constitute a
physical barrier that limits access of cytosolic proteins into the inner
proteolytic chamber.

Bey et al. (1993) mapped the PSMA1 gene to chromosome 11p15.1 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

DESCRIPTION Chemokines are basic, heparin-binding proteins of 8 to 12 kD that have 4
cysteines conserved among all family members. Hromas et al. (1997) noted
that the chemokine family is subdivided on the basis of where the first
2 cysteines are located. If they are separated by a single amino acid,
they are classified as the alpha family (also called C-X-C). If they are
adjacent to each other, they are classified as the beta family (also
called C-C). Members of the alpha family are located in a gene cluster
on 4q12-q21; the beta-family members are in a cluster on 17q11-q32.
Chemokines have been shown to regulate leukocyte infiltration into
inflamed tissue. Some chemokines, such as MIP-1-alpha (182283), also
inhibit hematopoietic progenitor cell proliferation. Three chemokines,
MIP-1-alpha, MIP-1-beta (182284), and RANTES (187011), have been found
to decrease significantly HIV production; several receptors for these
chemokines (e.g., CMKBR5; 601373) function as cell coreceptors for
HIV-1.

CLONING

Hromas et al. (1997) reported the cloning and characterization of a
novel human chemokine that they termed 'Exodus' for its chemotactic
properties. The full-length cDNA encodes a 95-amino acid polypeptide
that includes a 22-amino acid putative signal sequence. This novel
chemokine has approximately 28% homology with MIP-1-alpha and RANTES,
and shares several of their biologic activities. Exodus is expressed
preferentially in lymphocytes and monocytes, and its expression is
markedly upregulated by mediators of inflammation such as tumor necrosis
factor (TNF; 191160) and lipopolysaccharide. Purified synthetic Exodus
inhibited proliferation of myeloid progenitors in colony formation
assays. Exodus also stimulated chemotaxis of peripheral blood
mononuclear cells. The sequence homology, expression, and biologic
activity indicated that Exodus represents a novel, divergent
beta-chemokine.

Rossi et al. (1997) identified the Exodus chemokine, which they termed
MIP-3-alpha for 'macrophage inflammatory protein-3-alpha.'

Nelson et al. (2001) identified 2 variants of CCL20 that are derived by
use of alternative splice acceptor sites. One variant, isolated from
myeloid leukemia cells, T lymphocytes, and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated
monocyte RNA, contains an N-terminal alanine following removal of the
signal sequence. The second variant, isolated from liver, contains an
in-frame deletion of 3 bases that correspond to this alanine. The
deletion results in a protein that is shorter by 1 amino acid and
contains an N-terminal serine in the mature protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, Homey et al.
(2000) demonstrated that MIP3A, or CCL20, and its receptor, CCR6
(601835), are markedly upregulated in psoriasis (see 177900) and that
CCL20-expressing keratinocytes colocalize with CLA-positive (see PSGL1;
600738) skin-infiltrating T lymphocytes in lesional psoriatic skin. By
flow cytometry analysis, they showed that circulating CLA-positive
memory T cells in both normal and psoriatic individuals expressed high
levels of surface CCR6, which was expressed 100- to 1,000-fold higher
than other chemokine receptors on this T-cell subpopulation. CCL20 was
chemotactic for CLA-positive T cells at lower concentrations in
psoriatic than in normal donor lymphocytes. ELISA and RT-PCR analysis
showed that multiple cellular constituents of the skin produce CCL20 in
response to a variety of proinflammatory mediators, including TNF/IL1B
(147720), CD40LG (300386), IFNG (147570), and IL17 (603149).

Nelson et al. (2001) assayed the activity of the alanine-CCL20 and
serine-CCL20 splice variants toward several human peripheral blood
leukocytes. These chemokines showed negligible activity toward
neutrophils, monocytes, and naive T lymphocytes. However, flu antigen
plus IL2 (147680)-activated CD4+ (186940), and CD8+ (186910) T
lymphoblasts and cord blood-derived dendritic cells responded to both
forms of CCL20. Both forms exerted a dose-dependent effect on
recruitment of activated T cells and on intracellular calcium
mobilization.

Reboldi et al. (2009) found that Ccr6-deficient mice were highly
resistant to induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
(EAE), a model of multiple sclerosis (MS; 126200), but became
susceptible after transfer of small numbers of Ccr6-positive T cells.
Ccr6 was required on the first wave of Il17 (603149)-producing T-helper
cells (Th17 cells) entering the central nervous system (CNS) through
Ccl20-expressing epithelial cells in the choroid plexus. The
Ccr6-positive T cells triggered entry of a second wave of T cells that
migrated in large numbers into the CNS by crossing activated parenchymal
vessels. Reboldi et al. (2009) found that patients undergoing an initial
demyelinating event (the first clinical episode of MS) had significantly
higher frequencies of CCR6-positive/CD25 (IL2RA;
147730)-negative/CD4-positive inflammatory T cells in cerebrospinal
fluid than in peripheral blood. MS patients expressed high levels of
CCL20 in inflamed tissues, in GFAP (137780)-positive astrocytes, and in
choroid plexus. Reboldi et al. (2009) proposed that CCR6 and CCL20 may
represent an evolutionarily conserved axis that regulates the entry and
dissemination of T cells into the CNS.

GENE STRUCTURE

Nelson et al. (2001) determined that the CCL20 gene contains 4 exons.
The promoter region contains a TATA box, a TFIID (313650)-binding site,
overlapping AP2 (107580)-binding sites and an SV40 T antigen-binding
site. Harant et al. (2001) identified a putative CAAT-box and other
potential binding sites. By several criteria, they identified a
functional NF-kappa-B (164014) element that responded to TNF-alpha
stimulation. Kwon et al. (2003) identified a site that regulated both
basal and cytokine-induced gene activation and bound the ETS nuclear
factor ESE1 (ELF3;602191).

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybridization and radiation hybrid analysis, Hieshima et
al. (1997) mapped the CCL20 (formerly SCYA20) gene to 2q33-q37. By FISH,
Nelson et al. (2001) mapped the CCL20 gene to chromosome 2q35-q36.

604064	TITLE *604064 ACTIVATING TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 4; ATF4
;;CYCLIC AMP RESPONSE ELEMENT-BINDING PROTEIN 2; CREB2;;
TAX-RESPONSIVE ENHANCER ELEMENT B67; TAXREB67
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ATF4 belongs to the large ATF/CREB family of transcription factors.
These proteins bind DNA via their basic region and dimerize via their
leucine zipper domain to form a variety of homo- and heterodimers to
regulate gene transcription (De Angelis et al., 2003).

CLONING

An activating transcription factor (ATF)-binding site is a promoter
element present in a wide variety of viral and cellular genes, including
E1A-inducible adenoviral genes and cAMP-inducible cellular genes. Hai et
al. (1989) identified cDNAs encoding 8 different human ATF
consensus-binding proteins, including a partial cDNA corresponding to
ATF4. They found that members of this family share significant sequence
similarity within a leucine zipper DNA-binding motif and an adjacent
basic region; the proteins show little similarity outside of these
regions.

The cAMP response element (CRE) is an octanucleotide motif that mediates
diverse transcriptional regulatory effects. By screening a Jurkat T-cell
line expression library for the ability to bind CRE, Karpinski et al.
(1992) isolated a full-length cDNA corresponding to ATF4, which they
called CREB2 (CRE-binding protein-2). The predicted protein contains 351
amino acids. Northern blot analysis revealed that the 1.5-kb CREB2 mRNA
was expressed in all human tumor cell lines and mouse organs tested.

GENE FUNCTION

Karpinski et al. (1992) found that, unlike CREB (123810), which
activates transcription from CRE-containing promoters, CREB2 functions
as a specific repressor of CRE-dependent transcription. The
transcriptional repressor activity resides within the C-terminal leucine
zipper and basic domain region of the CREB2 protein.

The p40tax gene product of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)
activates HTLV-1 viral transcription in trans through tax-responsive
enhancers in the long terminal repeats. Tsujimoto et al. (1991)
identified ATF4 as TAXREB67, a protein that binds to the tax-responsive
enhancer element in HTLV-1.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay, He et al. (2001) found that mouse Nrf2
(NFE2L2; 600492) interacted with rat Atf4. Coimmunoprecipitation and
mammalian 2-hybrid analyses confirmed the interaction. An Nrf2-Atf4
dimer bound a stress response element (StRE) sequence from an Nrf2
target gene, Ho1 (HMOX1; 141250). CdCl2, an Ho1 inducer, increased
expression of Atf4 in mouse hepatoma cells prior to induction of Ho1. A
dominant-negative Atf4 mutant inhibited basal and CdCl2-induced
expression of an StRE-dependent construct in hepatoma cells, but it only
inhibited basal expression in a human mammary epithelial cell line. He
et al. (2001) concluded that ATF4 regulates HO1 expression in a
cell-specific manner, possibly in a complex with NRF2.

Siu et al. (2002) presented evidence that ATF4 binds nutrient-sensing
response element-1 (NSRE1) in the human asparagine synthetase (ASNS;
108370) gene and activates ASNS transcription in response to nutrient
stress.

Bagheri-Yarmand et al. (2003) found that expression of Atf4 was high in
virgin mouse mammary glands and in pregnant mammary glands, but it was
dramatically reduced during lactation and higher after weaning.
Transgenic mice overexpressing Atf4 in mammary epithelium showed
decreased proliferation and impaired differentiation of alveolar
epithelial cells during pregnancy and lactation. In addition, Atf4
overexpression induced apoptosis and accelerated involution of the
mammary gland, suggesting a role for ATF4 in the regulation of normal
mammary gland involution.

De Angelis et al. (2003) showed that human ATF4 and RBP3 (E2F1; 189971)
dimerized in vitro and in vivo and that RBP3 enhanced ATF4
transactivating activity. Expression of both proteins increased during
differentiation of a mouse myogenic cell line.

ATF4 has 2 upstream ORFs (uORFs) that are conserved in vertebrates. The
more 3-prime uORF, uORF2, extends into the coding region of full-length
ATF4. Independently, Lu et al. (2004) and Vattem and Wek (2004) found
that scanning ribosomes initiated translation at both uORFs of mouse
Atf4, and that ribosomes that translated uORF1 efficiently reinitiated
translation at downstream AUGs. In unstressed mouse fibroblasts, low
levels of phosphorylated Eif2 (see EIF2S1; 603907) favored early
capacitation of reinitiating ribosomes, directing them to the inhibitory
uORF2 downstream of uORF1, which precluded translation of Atf4 and
repressed the integrated stress response. In stressed cells, high levels
of phosphorylated Eif2 delayed capacitation of reinitiating ribosomes,
favoring reinitiation at the Atf4 coding sequence over uORF2, which
permitted Atf4 expression and activated the integrated stress response.

Using Rsk2 (300075) -/- mice, Yang et al. (2004) showed that RSK2 is
required for osteoblast differentiation and function. They identified
the transcription factor ATF4 as a critical substrate of RSK2 that is
required for the timely onset of osteoblast differentiation, for
terminal differentiation of osteoblasts, and for osteoblast-specific
gene expression. Additionally, RSK2 and ATF4 were found to
posttranscriptionally regulate the synthesis of type I collagen (see
120150), the main constituent of the bone matrix. Accordingly, Atf4
deficiency in mice resulted in delayed bone formation during embryonic
development and low bone mass throughout postnatal life. Yang et al.
(2004) concluded that ATF4 is a critical regulator of osteoblast
differentiation and function and that lack of ATF4 phosphorylation by
RSK2 may contribute to the skeletal phenotype of Coffin-Lowry syndrome
(303600).

Blais et al. (2004) determined that EIF2-alpha (EIF2S1), PERK (EIF2AK3;
604032), ATF4, and GADD34 (PPP1R15A; 611048) are involved in an
integrated adaptive response to hypoxic stress in HeLa cells.

Sayer et al. (2006) performed a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human fetal
brain expression library and identified ATF4 as a direct interaction
partner of CEP290 (NPHP6; 610142). The protein-interaction domains
mapped to the N-terminal third of CEP290, encoded by exons 2 through 21,
and the C-terminal two-thirds of ATF4. To confirm that CEP290 and ATF4
interact physiologically in vivo, Sayer et al. (2006) performed
coimmunoprecipitation experiments using bovine retina extracts.
Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that endogenous ATF4 can be
immunoprecipitated using an antibody to CEP290 but not using a control
IgG. Reverse coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that antibody to
ATF4 can also precipitate endogenous CEP290.

Lin et al. (2010) showed that although Skp2 (601436) inactivation on its
own does not induce cellular senescence, aberrant protooncogenic signals
as well as inactivation of tumor suppressor genes do trigger a potent,
tumor-suppressive senescence response in mice and cells devoid of Skp2.
Notably, Skp2 inactivation and oncogenic stress-driven senescence
neither elicit activation of the p19(Arf) (see 600160)-p53 (191170)
pathway nor DNA damage, but instead depend on Aft4, p27 (600778), and
p21 (116899). Lin et al. (2010) further demonstrated that genetic Skp2
inactivation evokes cellular senescence even in oncogenic conditions in
which the p19(Arf)-p53 response is impaired, whereas a Skp2-SCF complex
inhibitor can trigger cellular senescence in p53/Pten (601728)-deficient
cells and tumor regression in preclinical studies. Lin et al. (2010)
concluded that their findings provided proof-of-principle evidence that
pharmacologic inhibition of Skp2 may represent a general approach for
cancer prevention and therapy.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the ATF4
gene to chromosome 22 (TMAP stSG29796).

ANIMAL MODEL

Tanaka et al. (1998) used gene targeting to generate mice lacking Atf4.
They found that Atf4-deficient mice exhibited severe microphthalmia. The
Atf4-deficient eyes revealed a normal gross lens structure up to
embryonic day 14.5, after which the lens degenerated due to apoptosis
without the formation of lens secondary fiber cells. Retinal development
was normal in the mutant mice. The lens-specific expression of Atf4 in
the mutant mice led not only to the recovery of lens secondary fibers
but also to the induction of hyperplasia of these fibers. Tanaka et al.
(1998) concluded that ATF4 is essential for the later stages of lens
fiber cell differentiation.

NOMENCLATURE

The ATF4 gene, which Karpinski et al. (1992) referred to as CREB2,
should not be confused with the ATF2 gene (123811), which was formerly
known as CREB2.

;;PROTEASE INHIBITOR 2, MONOCYTE/NEUTROPHIL DERIVED; ELANH2;;
ELASTASE INHIBITOR, MONOCYTE/NEUTROPHIL; EI
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Monocyte/neutrophil elastase inhibitor (EI) is a protein of
approximately 42,000 Mr with serpin-like functional properties.
Remold-O'Donnell et al. (1992) cloned EI cDNA and identified 3 EI mRNA
species of 1.5, 1.9, and 2.6 kb in monocyte-like cells and no
hybridizing mRNA in lymphoblastoid cells lacking detectable EI enzymatic
activity. The cDNA open reading frame encoded a 379-amino acid protein.
Its sequence established EI as a member of the serpin superfamily.
Sequence alignment indicated that the reactive center P1 residue is
cys-344, consistent with abrogation of elastase inhibitory activity by
iodoacetamide and making EI a naturally occurring cys-serpin.

MAPPING

In the course of studying 4 closely linked genes encoding members of the
ovalbumin family of serine proteinase inhibitors (Ov-serpins) located on
18q21.3, Schneider et al. (1995) investigated the mapping of elastase
inhibitor. They prepared PCR primer sets of the gene, and by using the
NIGMS monochromosomal somatic cell hybrid panel, showed that the EI gene
maps to chromosome 6.

By amplifying DNA of a somatic cell hybrid panel, Evans et al. (1995)
unambiguously localized ELANH2 to chromosome 6. With the use of a panel
of radiation and somatic cell hybrids specific for chromosome 6, they
refined the localization to the short arm telomeric of D6S89, F13A
(134570), and D6S202 at 6pter-p24.

610292	TITLE *610292 B-CELL SCAFFOLD PROTEIN WITH ANKYRIN REPEATS 1; BANK1
;;FLJ20706;;
BANK
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

BANK1 is a B-cell-specific scaffold protein and LYN (165120) tyrosine
kinase substrate that promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of inositol
1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (see ITPR1; 147265) (Yokoyama et al.,
2002).

CLONING

By solid-phase phosphorylation screening, followed by database analysis
and PCR of RNA isolated from Daudi B cells, Yokoyama et al. (2002)
cloned BANK1, which they called BANK. The deduced 755-amino acid protein
has a calculated molecular mass of 85.5 kD. BANK1 shares amino acid
homology with mouse Bcap (PIK3AP1; 607942) especially over the ankyrin
repeat motifs and predicted coiled-coil regions. BANK1 contains 23
tyrosine residues that may be phosphorylated including several potential
SH2 domain binding sites. By Northern blot analysis, a 3.2-kb transcript
was detected in mouse spleen and human Daudi B cell line, but not in T
cells or myeloid cells. By RT-PCR analysis of various B and T lineage
cells, Yokoyama et al. (2002) showed that BANK1 expression was confined
to functional B-cell antigen receptor (BCR)-expressing B cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoprecipitation analysis and spectrophotometry, Yokoyama et al.
(2002) showed that BANK1 underwent receptor-dependent tyrosine
phosphorylation and that BANK1 activation enhanced BCR-induced calcium
mobilization from intracellular calcium stores. By coimmunoprecipitation
analysis of BANK1 and LYN mutants, Yokoyama et al. (2002) demonstrated
that BANK1 residues 367-653 were required for association with LYN and
tyrosine phosphorylation of BANK1. BANK1 amino acids 1-367 interacted
with ITPR2 (600144). By interaction and phosphorylation analyses of
coexpression of BANK1, LYN, and ITPR2 and various mutants, Yokoyama et
al. (2002) concluded that BANK1 promotes LYN-mediated tyrosine
phosphorylation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors.

MAPPING

By database sequence analysis, Yokoyama et al. (2002) mapped the BANK1
gene to chromosome 4q22-q24.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; 152700) is a prototypic autoimmune
disease characterized by production of autoantibodies and complex
genetic inheritance. In a genomewide association scan of SLE using
85,042 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), Kozyrev et al. (2008)
identified an association between SLE and a nonsynonymous substitution,
dbSNP rs10516487 (R61H; 610292.0001) in the BANK1 gene. They replicated
the association for independent case-control sets. In an analysis of
BANK1 cDNA, they found 2 isoforms, 1 full-length and the other
alternatively spliced and lacking exon 2, encoding a protein without a
putative domain for binding of IP3R (147265). The transcripts were
differentially expressed depending on a branch point-site SNP, dbSNP
rs17266594, in strong linkage disequilibrium with dbSNP rs10516487. A
third associated variant was found in the ankyrin domain (dbSNP
rs3733197). These findings implicated BANK1 as a susceptibility gene for
SLE, with variants affecting regulatory sites and key functional
domains. The disease-associated variants could contribute to sustained B
cell receptor signaling and B cell hyperactivity characteristic of SLE.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using flow cytometry, Aiba et al. (2006) showed that Bank was expressed
in most mouse B-cell subpopulations, but that Bank expression was
decreased in germinal center (GC) B cells. Aiba et al. (2006) generated
Bank-deficient mice and found that Bank was dispensable for most aspects
of B-cell development. However, Bank-deficient mice had higher levels of
mature B cells and spontaneous GC B cells, particularly in response to
T-dependent antigens, as well as higher serum IgG2a. Bank-deficient B
cells had an enhanced proliferative response to Cd40 (109535). Augmented
GC formation and IgM secretion in response to T-dependent antigen
immunization were abolished in mice lacking both Cd40 and Bank. Western
blot analysis revealed enhanced Cd40-mediated Akt (164730) activation in
Bank-deficient B cells. Aiba et al. (2006) concluded that BANK modulates
hyperactive B-cell responses by inhibiting AKT activation in
CD40-mediated pathways.

Kozyrev et al. (2008) identified an association between systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE; 152700) and a nonsynonymous substitution, dbSNP

that results in substitution of his for arg at codon 61, with the G

611435	TITLE *611435 DOCKING PROTEIN 3; DOK3
;;DOK-LIKE PROTEIN; DOKL
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis using Abl (ABL1; 189980) as bait, followed by
5-prime RACE of a mouse liver cDNA library, Cong et al. (1999) cloned
mouse Dok3, which they called Dokl. The deduced 444-amino acid mouse
protein contains an N-terminal PH domain, a central PTB domain, and a
proline-rich C-terminal domain. Dokl is relatively serine/threonine-rich
overall and contains several potential phosphorylation sites for ser/thr
protein kinases. Dokl shares 60% and 57% sequence similarity with p62dok
(DOK1; 602919) over the PH and PTB domains, respectively, with lower
similarity over the C-terminal regions. Northern blot analysis of mouse
tissues detected several species with high expression in spleen and lung
and low levels in other tissues. RNAse protection studies detected very
high Dokl expression in bone marrow and spleen, low expression in
thymus, and no expression in NIH3T3 cells. Immunofluorescence studies
localized Dokl to the cytoplasm in NIH3T3 cells.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis using Csk (124095) as bait, followed by
5-prime RACE of a mouse fetal thymus cDNA library, Lemay et al. (2000)
independently cloned mouse Dok3. RNAse protection assay of mouse tissues
detected high expression in spleen and bone marrow but not in thymus,
with little or no expression in nonlymphoid organs.

MAPPING

Berger et al. (2010) stated that the DOK3 gene maps to chromosome
5q35.3.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid and immunoprecipitation analysis of Dokl and Abl
mutants, Cong et al. (1999) showed that the Dokl PTB domain bound
phosphotyrosines on Abl in a kinase-dependent manner. In addition, the
Dokl PTB domain bound weakly to insulin receptor (INSR; 147670).
Immunoprecipitation and phosphorylation studies showed that Dokl served
as a substrate for phosphorylation by v-Abl, c-Abl, and Bcr-Abl (see
BCR; 151410). Overexpression of Dokl inhibited v-Abl-dependent
activation of MAPK1 (176948) and v-Abl transforming activity.

Lemay et al. (2000) showed that, in response to immunoreceptor
stimulation, Dok3 was tyrosine phosphorylated by Src (190090) family
members Lck (153390), Fyn (137025), and Lyn (165120).
Immunoprecipitation studies showed that Dok3 bound inhibitors SHIP
(INPP5D; 601582) and Csk (124095) but did not bind RasGAP (RASA1;
139150). Dok3 binding to SHIP occurred via the SH2 domain. Dok3 also
bound Csk via the Csk SH2 domain with possible involvement of the Csk
SH3 domain as well. Overexpression of Dok3 in a murine B-cell line
inhibited immunoreceptor-mediated NFAT (see 600490) activation. Lemay et
al. (2000) concluded that Dok3 acts as an adaptor in the recruitment of
inhibitory molecules and may play a role in negative regulation of
immunoreceptor signaling in hematopoietic cells.

Using a constitutively active form of Src, Honma et al. (2006)
identified Grb2 (108355) as a protein that bound Dok3 downstream of its
tyrosine phosphorylation. Dok3 sequestered Grb2 from Shc (600560),
resulting in negative regulation of the Ras-Erk pathway.

ANIMAL MODEL

Berger et al. (2010) found that mice with knockout of Dok1 (602919),
Dok2 (604997), or Dok3 each developed lung adenocarcinoma (211980). Mice
with double-knockouts of different combinations of these 3 genes
developed lung adenocarcinoma at an earlier age and with high
penetrance, suggesting that the proteins have partially redundant or
overlapping functions. Compared to wildtype lung tissue, Dok-mutant
tumors showed moderate staining for phosphorylated Akt (164730) and
strong staining for phosphorylated Erk (176872). Immunohistochemical
studies on isolated cells showed that the tumor cells arose from a
population of bronchioalveolar stem cells with inactivation of the Dok
proteins. These findings were consistent with a model of tumorigenesis
in which inactivation of the Dok1, Dok2, and Dok3 genes leads to
hyperactivation of Akt and Erk, and an expansion of the stem cells that
differentiate into alveolar type II cells.

606985	TITLE *606985 ELONGATOR ACETYLTRANSFERASE COMPLEX, SUBUNIT 4; ELP4
;;ELONGATION PROTEIN 4, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF;;
PAX6 NEIGHBOR GENE; PAX6NEB
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The yeast Elp4 protein is 1 of 6 subunits of elongator, a histone
acetylase complex that associates with the elongating form of RNA
polymerase-2. By database searching with yeast Elp4 as the query,
Winkler et al. (2001) obtained cDNAs encoding ELP4 in multiple species,
including human. The 424-amino acid human protein is 41% similar to
yeast Elp4. Northern blot analysis revealed ubiquitous but variable
expression in human tissues.

Kleinjan et al. (2002) identified ELP4, which they called PAXNEB, by
sequencing ESTs from a region telomeric of the PAX6 gene (607108).
Northern blot analysis detected a 2.0-kb transcript in all cell lines
tested. Whole mount in situ hybridization analysis found wide expression
of Paxneb in mouse embryos.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Kleinjan et al. (2002) determined that the
PAXNEB gene contains 10 exons transcribed in a telomere-to-centromere
direction, opposite to that of PAX6. The PAXNEB gene contains an
unusually large last intron covering 134 kb. Promoter analysis indicated
a GC-rich region lacking TATA or CAAT boxes, features typical of a
housekeeping gene.

Strug et al. (2009) determined that the ELP4 gene contains 12 exons
spanning 274 kb. They noted that alternative transcripts have been
reported that include or exclude the last 2 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Kleinjan et al. (2002) mapped the PAXNEB
gene to chromosome 11p13, a region associated with WAGR syndrome
(194072) and loss of heterozygosity in breast and bladder cancers.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

For a discussion of a possible association between variation in the ELP4
gene and susceptibility to rolandic epilepsy, see 117100.

ANIMAL MODEL

Loss-of-function mutations in the PAX6 gene are associated with the eye
anomaly aniridia (106210) in humans and the 'small eye' phenotype in
mice. However, some case of aniridia have been identified in which
chromosomal rearrangements leave the PAX6 gene intact and interrupt the
PAXNEB gene. Using a transgenic mouse model, Kleinjan et al. (2002)
failed to show that the small eye phenotype in mice is caused by
heterozygous loss of Paxneb function.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The TCF3 gene, also called E2A, encodes 2 basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)
transcription factors, E12 and E47, through alternative splicing. E12
and E47 are involved in regulation of immunoglobulin gene expression
(Bain et al., 1994).

CLONING

Expression of immunoglobulin genes depends on various sequence motifs in
their enhancer and promoter regions. One class of such sequences is the
E box, which is found in both heavy and light chain enhancers. The
kappa-E2 site has been shown to be important for light chain gene
transcription. To isolate cDNAs encoding kappa-E2-binding proteins,
Murre et al. (1989) screened a cDNA expression library derived from a
human B-cell lymphoma cell line (BJAB) with an oligonucleotide
containing a trimerized kappa-E2 site. They identified a partial cDNA
encoding a protein that they designated E12. Using the E12 cDNA to
rescreen the BJAB cDNA library, Murre et al. (1989) isolated a partial
cDNA encoding a protein that they designated E47. Sequence analysis
suggested that E12 and E47 are derived from a single gene, called E2A or
TCF3, via alternative splicing. E12 contains a leucine zipper; the
corresponding region of E47 was not cloned. Both the E12 and E47
proteins contain a region that is homologous to regions in MYOD
(159970), members of the MYC family (e.g., 190080), the Drosophila
'daughterless' gene product, and products of the Drosophila
'achaete-scute' and 'twist' gene families. The homologous regions have
the potential to form 2 amphipathic helices separated by an intervening
loop, and the hydrophobic residues present in the helices are highly
conserved.

Henthorn et al. (1990) independently cloned E2A and designated it ITF1.

GENE FUNCTION

Murre et al. (1989) showed that both E12 and E47 bound specifically to
the kappa-E2 sequence. They demonstrated that E47 bound kappa-E2 as a
dimer in vitro. Murre et al. (1989) demonstrated that the
helix-loop-helix motif of E12/E47 plays a crucial role in both
dimerization and DNA binding.

Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (101400) is an autosomal dominant
craniosynostosis syndrome characterized by premature fusion of coronal
sutures and limb abnormalities of variable severity. Mutations in TWIST
(601622), a class B basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor,
have been shown to be responsible for this phenotype. El Ghouzzi et al.
(2000) used a yeast 2-hybrid system to study interaction between TWIST
and E12, a potential partner in heterodimerization. Missense mutations
involving the helical domains of TWIST led to a complete loss of
heterodimerization with the E12 protein, and dramatically altered the
ability of the TWIST protein to localize in the nucleus of transfected
COS cells. The authors hypothesized that the E12-TWIST heterodimer may
serve as a negative regulator of transcription in osteoblastic cells.

TAL1 (187040) is necessary for establishment of the hematopoietic system
and can either activate or repress transcription depending upon other
factors recruited to TAL1-nucleated complexes. Goardon et al. (2006)
found that ETO2 (CBFA2T3; 603870) copurified with TAL1 complexes in
human and mouse erythroleukemia cells. Protein pull-down assays revealed
that ETO2 interacted with E2A and HEB (TCF12; 600480) within the TAL1
complex, but not with TAL1 itself. ETO2 also interacted with E2A in
erythroid cells independent of the TAL1 complex. Reporter gene assays
revealed that ETO2 repressed the transcriptional activity of the
complex. The ETO2 content in TAL1 complexes was high during the
proliferative phase in erythroid cells. In contrast, ETO2 was
downregulated upon terminal differentiation, concomitant with appearance
of histone modifications associated with gene activation and expression
of glycophorin A (GPA; 111300) and band 4.2 (EPB42; 177070), which are
markers of erythrocyte maturation. Knockdown of ETO2 via small
interfering RNA induced growth arrest and differentiation in human and
mouse erythroid progenitors. Goardon et al. (2006) concluded that ETO2
is required for expansion of erythroid progenitors, but that it is
dispensable for terminal maturation. They proposed that the
stoichiometry of ETO2 with the TAL1 complex controls the transition from
erythroid progenitor expansion to terminal differentiation.

The vitamin D receptor-interacting repressor (VDIR), a basic
helix-loop-helix transcription activator, regulates the transcription of
CYP27B1 (609506) by binding to the negative vitamin D response element
(nVDRE) in the CYP27B1 promoter (Kim et al., 2007).

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization and Southern analysis of rodent-human somatic
cell hybrids, Mellentin et al. (1989) demonstrated that the E2A gene
maps to 19p13.3-p13.2, a site associated with nonrandom translocations
in acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL; 613065). By fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Trask et al. (1993) assigned the TCF3 gene to 19p13.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a genomewide analysis of leukemic cells from 242 pediatric ALL
patients using high resolution, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
arrays and genomic DNA sequencing, Mullighan et al. (2007) identified
mutations in genes encoding principal regulators of B-lymphocyte
development and differentiation in 40% of B-progenitor ALL cases.
Deletions were detected in TCF3, IKZF1 (603023), IKZF3 (606221), EBF1
(164343), and LEF1 (153245). The PAX5 (167414) gene was the most
frequent target of somatic mutation, being altered in 31.7% of cases.

CYTOGENETICS

Evidence presented by Mellentin et al. (1989) suggested that most, and
perhaps all, t(1;19)(q23;p13) chromosomal translocations, a frequent
cytogenetic change in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, contain
rearrangements of the E2A gene.

Hunger (1996) reviewed clinical features and the molecular pathogenesis
of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) caused by chromosomal
translocations involving the E2A gene. E2A proteins play an
indispensable role in B-cell lymphopoiesis. The pathogenesis of a subset
of B-precursor ALLs involves replacement of the bHLH regions of the E2A
protein with heterologous DNA-binding domains.

- E2A/PBX1 Fusion Gene

Nourse et al. (1990) detected altered E2A transcripts, which lacked
sequences encoding the helix-loop-helix DNA-binding motif, in several
t(1;19)-carrying cell lines. They cloned fusion cDNAs that crossed the
t(1;19) breakpoint. These cDNAs encode an 85-kD protein consisting of
the N-terminal two-thirds of E2A fused to a chromosome 1-derived
protein. The fusion protein has the features of a chimeric transcription
factor in which the DNA-binding domain of E2A is replaced by the
putative DNA-binding domain of a homeoprotein from chromosome 1, which
Nourse et al. (1990) named PRL (PBX1; 176310) for 'pre-B cell leukemia.'
By PCR of 3 t(1;19)-carrying cell lines, the authors detected identical
E2A-PRL mRNA junctions, indicating that the fusion transcripts and
predicted chimeric protein are a consistent feature of this
translocation.

Kamps et al. (1990) found that a cell line with a t(1;19)(q23;p13.3)
translocation contains 2 novel chimeric mRNAs, both with the same
5-prime E2A sequences but with different lengths of 3-prime sequence
from a gene located on chromosome 1, which they called PRL (PBX1). The
chimeric RNAs encode proteins that lack 171 amino acids of E2A,
including its DNA-binding and dimerization motifs, but have instead a
homeobox-related sequence from PRL. Kamps et al. (1990) suggested that
the production of a chimeric E2A-PRL protein may contribute to the acute
lymphoblastic phenotype by directly altering the expression of genes
normally responsive to the PRL homeoprotein.

Wiemels et al. (2002) sequenced the genomic fusion between the E2A and
PBX1 genes in 22 pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemias and 2 cell lines.
The prenatal origin of the leukemia was assessed in 15 pediatric
patients by screening for the clonotypic E2A-PBX1 translocation in
neonatal blood spots, or Guthrie cards, obtained from the children at
birth. Two patients were weakly positive for the fusion at birth, in
contrast to previously studied childhood leukemia fusions, t(12;21),
t(8;21), and t(4;11), which are predominantly prenatal. The presence of
extensive N-nucleotides at the point of fusion in the E2A-PBX1
translocation as well as specific characteristics of the IGH
(147100)/TCR (see 186880) rearrangements provided additional evidence
for a postnatal, pre-B cell origin. Sixteen of 24 breakpoints on the
3.2-kb E2A intron 14 were located within 5 bp, providing evidence for a
site-specific recombination mechanism. Breakpoints on the 232-kb PBX1
intron 1 were more dispersed, but were highly clustered proximal to exon
2. Thus, the translocation breakpoints displayed evidence of unique
temporal, ontologic, and mechanistic formation in contrast to the
previously analyzed pediatric leukemia translocation breakpoints,
emphasizing the need to differentiate cytogenetic and molecular
subgroups for studies of leukemia causality.

- E2A/HLF Fusion Gene

Inaba et al. (1992) showed that a t(17;19) chromosomal translocation in
early B-lineage acute leukemia resulted in chimeric transcripts that
contained sequences from the E2A basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)
transcription factor gene on chromosome 19, fused to sequences from a
gene on chromosome 17 that encodes a hepatic leukemia factor (HLF;
142385). The chimeric protein consisted of the amino-terminal
transactivation domain of E2A linked to the carboxyl-terminal basic
region-leucine zipper domain of HLF.

Kurosawa et al. (1999) found that E2A/HLF upregulated expression of
SRPUL (SRPX2; 300642) and annexin-8 (ANXA8; 602396) in pro-B cells.
Transfection of a human myeloid leukemia cell line with E2A/HLF induced
expression of ANXA8, but not SRPUL. E2A/HLF protected mouse pro-B cells
from apoptosis caused by IL3 (147740) deprivation, but neither ANXA8 or
SRPUL could block apoptosis, suggesting that they are not involved in
malignant transformation.

Using representational difference analysis, Dang et al. (2001) found
that the E2A/HLF fusion protein upregulated expression of several
groucho-related genes (GRGs), including Grg2 and Grg6 (TLE6; 612399),
following expression in a mouse pro-B cell line. A mutant E2A/HLF
protein lacking DNA-binding activity also stimulated expression of GRGs.
Among the transcription factors that interact with GRG proteins, only
Runx1 (151385) was appreciably downregulated by E2A/HLF.

- E2A/TFPT Fusion Gene

Brambillasca et al. (1999) identified 4 cases of acute lymphoblastic
leukemia displaying E2A/FB1 (TFPT; 609519) chimeric transcripts that
appeared to originate from a cryptic rearrangement of chromosome 19. The
5-prime portion of E2A was interrupted at different positions within
exons 13 or 14 and fused to FB1. The fusion was in-frame in 1 case, and
the remaining cases showed out-of-frame fusions leading to stop codons
in FB1 or to truncation of the predicted chimeric product. Brambillasca
et al. (1999) found no evidence of reciprocal chimeric transcripts.

ANIMAL MODEL

Heterodimers between tissue-specific basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)
proteins and the products of the E2A gene play major roles in
determining tissue-specific cell fate. The E2A gene gives rise to 2
proteins, E12 and E47, by differential splicing of E12- and E47-specific
bHLH-encoding exons. Although they were initially identified in B cells
as immunoglobulin enhancer-binding proteins, they were subsequently
found to be present in most cell types. To understand the broad role of
E2A in development, Zhuang et al. (1994) generated E2A mutant mice
following homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. Homozygous
mutant mice developed to full term without apparent abnormalities, but
then displayed a high rate of postnatal death. The surviving mice showed
retarded postnatal growth. Detailed examination of hematopoiesis
revealed that the homozygous mutant mice contained no B cells, whereas
other lineages, including the T cell, granulocyte, macrophage, and
erythroid lineages, were intact. The block to B-cell differentiation
occurred before the immunoglobulin gene D(H)-J(H) rearrangement.
Surprisingly, heterozygous embryos contained, on average, about half as
many B cells as did wildtype embryos, suggesting the existence of a
counting mechanism that translates levels of E2A into numbers of B
cells.

Sun (1994) generated transgenic mice in which the Id1 gene (600349) was
constitutively overexpressed in the B-cell lineage. The product of this
gene is an inhibitor of the DNA-binding activity of bHLH proteins such
as the E2A gene product. The phenotype of these transgenic mice depicted
severe defects in early B-cell development, suggesting that the bHLH
proteins play pivotal roles in B-cell development and that the
downregulation of Id1 gene expression is necessary for B cells to
differentiate.

Bain et al. (1994) likewise generated E2A-null mice by gene targeting
and found that they failed to generate mature B cells. The arrest of
B-cell development occurred at an early stage since no immunoglobulin DJ
rearrangements could be detected. The finding suggested a crucial role
for E2A products in the regulation of early B-cell differentiation.

To investigate the biologic role of the E2A-HLF fusion gene, Honda et
al. (1999) generated transgenic mice expressing E2A-HLF in the lymphoid
lineage. The transgenic mice exhibited abnormal development in the
thymus and spleen and were susceptible to infection. The thymus
contained small numbers of thymocytes and showed a high population of
thymocytes undergoing apoptosis. The spleen exhibited a marked reduction
in lymphocytes, and studies showed that B-cell maturation was blocked at
a very early developmental stage. Several transgenic mice developed
acute leukemia, classified as T-ALL. Smith et al. (1999) likewise
studied the function of the fusion gene in transgenic mice.
Approximately 60% of E2A-HLF mice developed lymphoid malignancies with a
mean latency of 10 months. Tumors were monoclonal, consistent with the
requirement for secondary genetic events. Smith et al. (1999) concluded
that the fusion gene disrupts the differentiation of T-lymphoid
precursors in vivo, leading to profound postnatal thymic depletion and
rendering B- and T-cell progenitors susceptible to malignant
transformation.

NOMENCLATURE

The TCF3 gene, also known as E2A, should not be confused with the the
TCF7L1 gene (604652), which was initially designated TCF3. TCF3 encodes
the bHLH transcription factors E12 and E47, whereas TCF7L1 encodes a
TCF/LEF transcription factor involved in Wnt (see 164820) signaling.

607363	TITLE *607363 KINETOCHORE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1; KNTC1
;;ROUGH DEAL, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF; ROD;;
KIAA0166
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

KNTC1 is a homolog of the Drosophila 'rough deal' (Rod) protein, a
component of the mitotic checkpoint surveillance mechanism. This complex
prevents the onset of anaphase by elaborating an inhibitory signal until
all chromosomes are properly attached and aligned on the spindle
(Scaerou et al., 2001).

CLONING

By randomly sequencing clones obtained from a human myeloid cell line,
Nagase et al. (1996) cloned KNTC1, which they called KIAA0166. The
deduced protein contains 2,209 amino acids. Northern blot analysis
revealed low-to-moderate expression in all tissues tested, with highest
expression in testis.

By Western blot analysis of HeLa cells, Chan et al. (2000) found that
KNTC1, which they called ROD, has a relative molecular mass close to the
calculated molecular mass of 250 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

By coimmunoprecipitation of HeLa cells, Chan et al. (2000) and Scaerou
et al. (2001) determined that KNTC1 interacts with ZW10 (603954). Using
a yeast 2-hybrid screen, Scaerou et al. (2001) localized the
ZW10-binding region to the middle third of KNTC1. By immunofluorescence
localization, Chan et al. (2000) found KNTC1 throughout the cytoplasm of
cells at all mitotic stages. A fraction of the total pool was associated
with kinetochores and the spindle during mitosis. KNTC1 initially
concentrated at kinetochores during prometaphase. During metaphase,
staining moved to the spindle fibers and prominently to the spindle
poles. By late anaphase, KNTC1 was detected only at the spindle poles.
KNTC1 colocalized with ZW10 at kinetochores at prometaphase. Using
synchronized HeLa cells, Scaerou et al. (2001) found KNTC1 and ZW10
colocalized at kinetochores during prometaphase and metaphase, with the
brightest staining for both proteins on the spindle near the poles.
After late anaphase and telophase, ZW10 accumulated at the spindle
midzone, while KNTC1 staining became prominent at the spindle poles. By
injection of antibodies directed toward KNTC1 or ZW10 into HeLa cells
shortly after their release from the G1/S boundary, Chan et al. (2000)
found that anaphase cells contained lagging chromosomes and divided
cells contained chromatin bridges. They concluded that both KNTC1 and
ZW10 are essential components of the mitotic checkpoint.

MAPPING

By analysis of human-rodent hybrid cell lines, Nagase et al. (1996)
mapped the KNTC1 gene to chromosome 17. However, Gross (2011) mapped the
KNTC1 gene to chromosome 12q24.31 based on an alignment of the KNTC1
sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC150278) with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

134690	TITLE *134690 FAU GENE; FAU
;;FBR-MuSV ASSOCIATED UBIQUITOUSLY EXPRESSED GENE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The FAU gene is the cellular homolog of the fox sequence in the
Finkel-Biskis-Reilly murine sarcoma virus (FBR-MuSV) (summary by Kas et
al., 1992).

CLONING

Kas et al. (1992) cloned and sequenced the human FAU gene. Its name is
derived from 'FBR-MuSV associated ubiquitously expressed gene.' FAU
encodes a fusion protein consisting of 133 amino acids. The 59 amino
acids at the carboxy terminus encode the ribosomal protein S30, part of
the small ribosomal subunit. The amino-terminal part of FAU (74 amino
acids) shows strong homology to ubiquitin, a 76-amino acid
multifunctional cellular protein.

MAPPING

Kas et al. (1993) used a cosmid clone containing the human FAU gene for
fluorescence in situ hybridization to localize the gene to 11q13. The
localization was confirmed by hybridization against a panel of somatic
cell hybrids containing different parts of chromosome 11 on a hamster
background. FAU was then further mapped, both on a panel of
radiation-reduced somatic cell hybrids designed to carry different parts
of the 11q13 region and by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. This fine
mapping placed FAU close to the PYGM gene (608455) in a region that
contains oncogenes as well as the putative tumor suppressor genes MEN1
(613733) and ST3 (191181).

By linkage mapping, Casteels et al. (1995) assigned the Fau gene to
mouse chromosome 19.

Courseaux et al. (1996) used a combination of methods to refine maps of
the approximately 5-Mb region of 11q13 that includes MEN1 (613733). They
proposed the following gene order:
cen--PGA--FTH1--UGB--AHNAK--ROM1--MDU1--CHRM1--COX8--EMK1--FKBP2--PLCB3--[PYGM,
ZFM1]--FAU--CAPN1--[MLK3, RELA]--FOSL1--SEA--CFL1--tel.

OTHER FEATURES

Kapranov et al. (2010) demonstrated that human cells contain a novel
type of short RNA (sRNA) with a nongenomically encoded 5-prime poly(U)
tail. They proposed that the presence of these RNAs at the termini of
genes, specifically at the very 3-prime ends of known mRNAs, such as
that for FAU, strongly argues for the presence of a yet uncharacterized
endogenous biochemical pathway in cells that can copy RNA. Kapranov et
al. (2010) showed that this pathway can operate on multiple genes, with
specific enrichment toward transcript-encoding components of the
translational machinery. They also showed that genes are also flanked by
sense, 3-prime polyadenylated sRNAs that are likely to be capped.

HEAT-SHOCK 40-KD PROTEIN 4; HSPF4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The E. coli heat-shock protein DnaJ has been implicated in protein
folding, proteolysis, phosphorylation, and replication of phage. By
screening a human umbilical vein endothelial cell cDNA expression
library with a monoclonal antibody that reacts specifically with human
endothelial cells and monocytes, Chellaiah et al. (1993) isolated cDNAs
encoding DNAJA1, which they named HDJ2. The deduced 397-amino acid
DNAJA1 protein is 32% identical to E. coli DnaJ, with the highest
identity in the N-terminal region. Among the known DNAJ homologs in S.
cerevisiae, DNAJA1 is most identical to YDJ1, which may be involved in
the transport of certain proteins into the mitochondria and endoplasmic
reticulum.

By immunohistochemical analysis and Western blot analysis, Terada et al.
(2005) showed that Dja1 was expressed in mouse testis and prostate.

ANIMAL MODEL

Terada et al. (2005) found that loss of Dja1 in mice led to severe
defects in spermatogenesis that involved aberrant androgen signaling.
Transplantation experiments with fluorescence-tagged spermatogonia into
Dja1 -/- mice revealed a primary defect of Sertoli cells in maintaining
spermiogenesis at steps 8 and 9. In Sertoli cells of Dja1 -/- mice, the
androgen receptor (313700) markedly accumulated with enhanced
transcription of several androgen-responsive genes, including Pem (MUC1;
158340) and testis-derived transcript (TES; 606085). Disruption of
Sertoli-germ cell adherens junctions was also evident in Dja1 -/- mice.
Experiments with Dja1 -/- fibroblasts and primary Sertoli cells
indicated aberrant androgen receptor signaling.

612072	TITLE *612072 MIF4G DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN; MIF4GD
;;SLBP-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1; SLIP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen, Cakmakci et al. (2008) identified a
protein, which they designated SLIP1, that binds to a 15-amino acid
N-terminal region of stem-loop binding protein (SLBP; 602422). This
region of SLBP binds to the 3-prime end of histone mRNA. Cakmakci et al.
(2008) identified 5 conserved residues in this region of SLBP that are
required for histone translation and found that mutations in any of
these residues reduced SLIP1 binding. Coexpression of SLIP1 and SLBP in
Xenopus oocytes stimulated translation of a reporter mRNA with a
stem-loop, as in histone mRNAs, but not of a reporter with a poly(A)
tail. Expression of SLIP1 in HeLa cells also stimulated expression of a
GFP reporter mRNA ending in a stem-loop. Downregulation of endogenous
SLIP1 by siRNA reduced the rate of translation of endogenous histone
mRNA as well as cell viability. Cakmakci et al. (2008) proposed that
SLIP1 stimulates histone mRNA translation by bridging between SLBP and
the 5-prime end of histone mRNA.

MAPPING

Scott (2008) mapped the SLIP1 gene to chromosome 17q25.1 based on an
alignment of the SLIP1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AC022211) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.3).

DESCRIPTION For background information on the chemokine gene family, see CXCL10
(147310).

CLONING

Using protein fold recognition methodology, Pisabarro et al. (2006)
identified a novel chemokine that they termed DMC. The predicted
119-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 13.8 kD and
shares 71% identity with its mouse homolog. DMC has an N-terminal signal
peptide, but no N-glycosylation sites. Secondary structure analysis
showed highest similarity to CXCL8 (IL8; 146930), whereas circular
dichroism analysis revealed that active, purified DMC adopted a
secondary structure resembling that of CCL5 (187011) and CCL4 (182284).
Northern blot analysis detected expression of DMC in adult trachea and
stomach and fetal lung. Immunohistochemical analysis showed expression
of DMC in intestine and normal and asthmatic adult lung.

By microarray analysis, Weinstein et al. (2006) identified VCC1 as a
novel gene coregulated with VEGF (192240) expression in tumors and
angiogenesis models. The predicted VCC1 protein contains 2 CXC chemokine
motifs, but a hidden Markov model showed significant similarity to CCL17
(601520) and CCL16 (601394). Northern blot analysis of human tissues
detected a 1-kb transcript in lung and skeletal muscle only. Microarray
and RT-PCR analyses showed that VCC1 expression was upregulated in
breast and colon tumors. In situ hybridization analysis demonstrated
expression of VCC1 in normal and transformed breast epithelial cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using migration assays, Pisabarro et al. (2006) showed that DMC
attracted nonactivated monocytes and dendritic cells (DCs), but not
other blood cell types. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated specific
binding of DMC to DCs and monocytes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Weinstein et al. (2006) determined that the VCC1 gene has 4 exons and
spans approximately 15 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Weinstein et al. (2006) mapped the VCC1
gene to chromosome 19q11.
