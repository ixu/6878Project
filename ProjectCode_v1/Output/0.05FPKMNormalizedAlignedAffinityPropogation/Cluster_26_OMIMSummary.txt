;;KERATIN 1B; K1B
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Keratins, such as KRT77, are filament proteins that make up one of the
major structural fibers of epithelial cells (Rogers et al., 2005).

CLONING

Using database analysis to identify keratin genes within the type II
keratin gene domain on chromosome 12, Rogers et al. (2005) identified
KRT77, which they called K1B. The deduced 578-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 61.8 kD. Like other type II keratins, K1B
has N- and C-terminal domains and a central rod domain consisting of 4
alpha-helical regions separated by 3 nonhelical linker sequences. In
addition, it has numerous GGG and GGX repeats in its head and tail
domains. Northern blot analysis detected weak expression of a 3.0-kb K1B
transcript in skin, but not in scalp or in any other tissues or organs
examined.

Using in situ hybridization and indirect immunofluorescence, Langbein et
al. (2005) detected strong K1B expression in the ducts of eccrine sweat
glands, but not in the deeper secretory portion of the glands.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Rogers et al. (2005) mapped the KRT77 gene
to chromosome 12q13.13.

;;ALL1-FUSED GENE FROM CHROMOSOME 1q; AF1Q
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Tse et al. (1995) identified the AF1Q (MLLT11) gene as the translocation
partner of the MLL gene in 2 infants with acute myelomonocytic leukemia
and t(1;11)(q21;q23). In one of the patients, the derivative chromosome
11 represented an in-frame fusion of the N-terminal portion of the MLL
gene to the complete AF1Q open reading frame, whereas the derivative
chromosome 1 did not give rise to an open reading frame. This
observation suggested that the N-terminal portion of the MLL gene is
critical for leukemogenesis in translocations involving band 11q23.

Using a repeat-free chromosome 1 probe, Tse et al. (1995) isolated the
AF1Q cDNA from a human fibroblast cDNA library. The deduced AF1Q protein
contains 90 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 9 kD. AF1Q
was found to be highly expressed in the thymus but not in peripheral
lymphoid tissues. In contrast to its restricted distribution in normal
hematopoietic tissue, AF1Q was expressed in all leukemic cell lines
tested.

MAPPING

The MLLT11 gene maps to chromosome 1q21 (Tse et al., 1995).
