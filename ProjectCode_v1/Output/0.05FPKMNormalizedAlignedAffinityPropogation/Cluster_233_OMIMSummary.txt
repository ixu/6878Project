;;MAJOR LATE TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR; MLTF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Upstream stimulatory factor (USF) is a ubiquitously expressed cellular
transcription factor. Purified USF consists of 2 related polypeptides,
USF1, of 43 kD, and USF2 (600390), of 44 kD. USF1 belongs to the MYC
(190080) family of DNA-binding proteins (Gregor et al., 1990; Viollet et
al., 1996).

CLONING

Gregor et al. (1990) cloned USF1 by microsequence analysis of purified
USF protein. USF1 contains a C-terminal DNA-binding domain that includes
a helix-loop-helix motif and a leucine repeat. Gregor et al. (1990) also
identified alternatively spliced USF1 variants.

Sirito et al. (1994) cloned mouse Usf1. Northern blot analysis detected
Usf1 expression in all mouse tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Gregor et al. (1990) found that USF1 interacted with its target DNA as a
dimer. The leucine repeat of USF1 was required for efficient DNA binding
and USF1 dimerization, but the isolated helix-loop-helix domain also
bound DNA.

Sirito et al. (1994) found that mouse Usf1 and Usf2 had similar DNA
binding properties.

Viollet et al. (1996) found that USF1/USF2a heterodimers represented
more than 66% of the USF-binding activity in vivo, whereas USF1 and
USF2a homodimers represented less that 10%. USF1/USF2b heterodimers
accounted for almost 15% of the USF species in some cell lines. The
preferential heterodimerization of USF subunits was reproduced ex vivo,
but in vitro cotranslated subunits or recombinant USF proteins dimerized
randomly. In transiently transfected HeLa or hepatoma cells, USF2a and
USF1 homodimers transactivated a minimal promoter with similar
efficiency, whereas USF2b was a poor transactivator of the minimal
promoter. USF1, USF2a, and USF2b homodimers were equally efficient in
transactivating the liver-specific pyruvate kinase gene (609712)
promoter.

By transfection experiments, Roy et al. (1997) found that USF1 can act
synergistically with GTF2I (601679) to activate transcription through
both pyrimidine-rich initiator (Inr) elements and E-box elements of the
adenovirus major late promoter. By mutation analysis, they determined
that this synergistic action requires both the activation and
dimerization domains of USF1. By in vitro cotranslation followed by
coimmunoprecipitation studies, they confirmed direct protein interaction
between GTF2I and USF1.

Iynedjian (1998) demonstrated that mammalian USF1 activated reporter
gene expression from the E box within the promoter of the liver-specific
glucokinase gene (GCK; 138079). Expression of a truncated form of USF1
lacking the transcription activation domain and the basic region
decreased reporter activity by a dominant-negative effect.

Hosts and pathogens evolve various responses for controlling infection
and evading destruction, respectively. Using column chromatography,
Zhong et al. (2001) identified a factor in Chlamydia trachomatis, the
causative organism of trachoma and chronic urogenital infection, that
degrades the transcription factors RFX5 (601863) and USF1. The
degradation of these host factors correlates with the suppression of MHC
class I and class II antigen expression in infected cells, thereby
suppressing the host immune response.

Resting human lymphocytes do not have telomerase activity, but
activation by a variety of stimuli induces TERT (187270) expression and
telomerase activity. Yago et al. (2002) found that activated human T and
B lymphocytes expressed USF1 and the full-length isoform of USF2, and
that dimers of these proteins bound E boxes in the TERT promoter and
activated TERT expression. In contrast, resting human T and B
lymphocytes expressed both the N-terminally truncated isoform of USF2
and full-length USF2, and the truncated isoform had a dominant-negative
effect on TERT expression induced by full-length USF2.

MAPPING

Shieh et al. (1993) assigned the USF1 gene to 1q22-q23 by study of
mouse/human somatic cell hybrids and by in situ hybridization. With the
isolation of the Usf1 cDNA in the mouse by RT-PCR, Henrion et al. (1995)
could use isotopic in situ hybridization to map the gene to bands 1H and
11C-E in the mouse. Since chromosome 1 of the mouse is homologous to the
region of human chromosome 1 where USF1 is located, Henrion et al.
(1995) suggested that the sequence on chromosome 11 is a pseudogene or a
related gene. In the mouse, Steingrimsson et al. (1995) mapped this and
4 other bHLH-ZIP transcription factors by interspecific backcross
analysis. Usf1 had previously been mapped to mouse chromosome 1 by in
situ hybridization, but its position on the meiotic linkage map had not
been determined. Its location was consistent with the location of the
human gene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Pajukanta et al. (2004) showed that familial combined hyperlipidemia
(FCHL1; 602491) was linked and associated with the USF1 gene in 60
extended Finnish families, including 721 genotyped individuals (p =
0.00002), especially in males with high triglycerides (p = 0.0000009).
They identified several SNPs in tight linkage disequilibrium and a
common SNP haplotype defining the disease-associated USF1 allele. They
also identified a new putative regulatory element in USF1 flanking the
susceptibility haplotype.

Shoulders (2004) diagrammed a theoretical scenario whereby the use of a
putative promoter in intron 7 of USF1 might lead to the generation of a
mini-USF1 protein lacking the transactivation domain. Because mini-USF
proteins in vitro behave as transdominant inhibitors
(Lefrancois-Martinez et al., 1995; Viollet et al., 1996), whether the
putative promoter identified by Pajukanta et al. (2004) might operate in
vivo to downregulate USF1 activity should be established.

USF1 is a transcription factor controlling expression of several genes
involved in lipid and glucose homeostasis and colocalizes with FCHL and
type 2 diabetes (see 125853) on chromosome 1q22-q23. Putt et al. (2004)
identified 3 common polymorphisms in USF1 and examined their association
with fasting and postprandial lipids and with response to an oral
glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in the European Atherosclerosis Research
Study II offspring study. In haplotype analysis, 475C/1748T showed
significantly higher and 475T/1748T showed lower peak glucose during the
OGTT. There was significant case-control heterogeneity in the
interaction of genotype with body mass index (BMI) and fasting low
density lipoprotein (LDL) with 306A-G and 1748C-T, respectively. The
interaction of BMI and 475C-T on fasting glucose levels achieved
case-control heterogeneity of borderline significance. Furthermore,
475C-T showed interaction with polymorphisms in both hormone-sensitive
lipase (HSL; 151750) and APOC3 (107720) on area under the curve (AUC)
triglycerides and plasma apoE levels, respectively. Putt et al. (2004)
concluded that in these healthy young men, variation in USF1 was the
influencing feature of both glucose and lipid homeostasis, showing
case-control heterogeneity.

Coon et al. (2005) reported an association between the 2 USF1 SNPs
identified by Pajukanta et al. (2004) and FCHL, LDL cholesterol, and
triglycerides in a large sample of 2,195 individuals from 87 Utah
pedigrees. The pedigrees were ascertained for traits related to FCHL,
including early death due to coronary heart disease, early strokes, or
early-onset hypertension.

ANIMAL MODEL

By analyzing the glucose responsiveness of Usf knockout mice, Vallet et
al. (1998) determined that normal responsiveness required either
Usf1/Usf2 heterodimers or Usf2 homodimers, even in mice with total Usf
binding activity reduced by half. Usf1 homodimers gave rise to delayed
glucose responsiveness.

Casado et al. (1999) stated that the E box within the FASN (600212)
promoter is regulated by USF1, USF2, and SREBP1 (184756). They analyzed
the glucose responsiveness of hepatic Fasn gene expression in Usf1 and
Usf2 knockout mice and found that in both types of mutant mice,
induction of the Fasn gene by refeeding a carbohydrate-rich diet was
severely delayed. In contrast, expression of Srebp1 was almost normal,
and insulin response was unchanged. Casado et al. (1999) concluded that
the USF transactivators, and especially USF1/USF2 heterodimers, are
essential to sustain the dietary induction of the FASN gene in liver.

Wu et al. (2010) reported that overexpression of human USF1 in both
transgenic mice and mice with transient liver-specific overexpression
influenced metabolic trait phenotypes, including obesity, total
cholesterol level, LDL and VLDL cholesterol level, and glucose/insulin
ratio. Additional analyses of trait and hepatic gene expression data
from an F2 population derived from C57BL/6J and C3H/HeJ strains in which
there is a naturally occurring variation in Usf1 expression supported a
causal role for Usf1 for relevant metabolic traits. Gene network and
pathway analyses of the liver gene expression signatures in the F2
population and the hepatic overexpression model suggested the
involvement of Usf1 in immune responses and metabolism, including an
Igfbp2 (146731)-centered module. In all 3 mouse model settings, notable
sex specificity was observed, consistent with human studies showing
differences in association with USF1 gene polymorphisms between sexes.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPERLIPIDEMIA, FAMILIAL COMBINED, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
USF1, USF1S1

Pajukanta et al. (2004) identified 2 SNPs of the USF1 gene, usf1s1
(dbSNP rs3737787) and usf1s2 (191523.0002), that were associated with
familial combined hyperlipidemia mapping to a locus on 1q21-q23
(602491). The usf1s1 SNP is located in the 3-prime untranslated region
(Naukkarinen et al., 2005). The common alleles (1-1) of the 2 SNPs
define an at-risk haplotype. Allelic associations of the at-risk
haplotype were found with triglycerides, apoB (107730), total
cholesterol, and LDL peak particle size, supporting the concept that
USF1 affects the complex lipid phenotype of FCHL and not only 1 lipid
trait.

.0002
HYPERLIPIDEMIA, FAMILIAL COMBINED, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
USF1, USF1S2

The usf1s2 SNP (dbSNP rs2073658) is located in intron 7; see 191523.0001
and Pajukanta et al. (2004).

Naukkarinen et al. (2005) identified a 20-bp DNA sequence in intron 7 of
the USF1 gene, containing dbSNP rs2073658, that bound nuclear proteins
and likely represented a transcriptional regulatory element. This
functional role was further supported by the differential expression of
USF1-regulated genes in fat biopsy between individuals carrying
different allelic variants of USF1. Apolipoprotein E (APOE; 107741) was
the most downregulated gene in the at-risk individuals, linking the
potential risk alleles of USF1 with the impaired APOE-dependent
catabolism of atherogenic lipoprotein particles.
