DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Stern et al. (1993) noted that T-cell lymphoproliferative diseases often
result from chromosomal translocations involving the T-cell receptor
genes and genes that are thought to favor proliferation by virtue of
their abnormal expression following rearrangement. Several genes have
been identified at or near translocation breaks in immature T-cell
leukemias. Stern et al. (1993) identified a novel gene on Xq28
associated with mature T-cell proliferation. They studied 2 patients,
one with benign clonal proliferation and another with a T-cell
prolymphocytic leukemia, who both had the rare but recurrent t(X;14)
translocation and a common Xq28 breakpoint. The gene, which the authors
symbolized MTCP1, was abnormally transcribed in T cells from both
patients. MTCP1 uses alternate splicing and appears to have 2 short open
reading frames.

Soulier et al. (1994) cloned a splice variant of mouse Mtcp1 that
encodes a deduced 68-amino acid protein, which they called p8. They also
identified possible splice variants that shorten the 5-prime UTR without
modifying the 68-codon ORF. Mouse p8 shares 88% identity with human p8,
which is also 68 amino acids long. Western blot analysis detected
variable p8 expression in several T-cell lines, non-T leukemia and
lymphoblastoid cell lines, and COS-7 cells. A t(X;14)-associated
leukemia showed overexpression of p8 compared with normal peripheral
blood lymphocytes (PBLs). Mouse p8 was expressed in a cytoplasmic
granular pattern in transfected COS-7 cells.

Madani et al. (1996) stated that p8 MTCP1 is a mitochondrial protein. By
PCR, they cloned a splice variant of MTCP1 that encodes a deduced
107-amino acid protein, which they called p13 MTCP1. Human p13 MTCP1
shares no similarity with p8 MTCP1, but it shares 95% amino acid
identity with mouse p13 Mtcp1 and 39% identity with human TCL1 (TCL1A;
186960). Western blot analysis detected p13 MTCP1 at an apparent
molecular mass of 13 kD in transfected COS-7 cells. The p13 MTCP1
protein was weakly expressed in leukemia cells bearing the t(X;14)
translocation, but not in other leukemia cells, normal PBLs, or
activated lymphocytes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Soulier et al. (1994) determined that the MTCP1 gene contains at least 7
exons. The 5-prime UTR contains a long GC-rich sequence.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, Stern et al. (1993) confirmed the localization
of the MTCP1 gene to Xq28.

GENE FUNCTION

Gritti et al. (1998) showed that overexpression of human p13 MTCP1 in
lymphoid tissue of mice resulted in late-onset (after 15 months) T-cell
prolymphocytic leukemia. Western blot analysis suggested that the level
of transgene expression correlated with tumor incidence.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 3 unrelated families with an X-linked recessive
syndromic form of moyamoya disease (MYMY4; 300845), Miskinyte et al.
(2011) identified 3 different deletions on chromosome Xq28. The critical
region of overlap was a 3.4-kb region including exon 1 of the MTCP1 gene
and the first 3 exons of BRCC3 (300617), resulting in loss of BRCC3 and
MTCP1NB expression in patient lymphoblastoid cell lines. Morpholino
knockdown of Brcc3 in zebrafish resulted in defective angiogenesis that
could be rescued by endothelial expression of Brcc3, suggesting that
loss of BRCC3 function was responsible for the human disorder. The
phenotype is a multisystem disorder characterized by moyamoya disease,
short stature, hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, and facial dysmorphism.
Other variable features include dilated cardiomyopathy and premature
graying of the hair. Miskinyte et al. (2011) noted that some of the
features of the disorder were reminiscent of chromosome breakage
syndromes.

606684	TITLE *606684 FXYD DOMAIN-CONTAINING ION TRANSPORT REGULATOR 7; FXYD7
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The gene family FXYD (pronounced fix-id) consists of small membrane
proteins containing a core motif of 35 invariant and conserved amino
acids centered on a single transmembrane span.

CLONING

By EST database searching and in silico analysis, Sweadner and Rael
(2000) identified genes and protein sequences for 7 FXYD molecules in
rodents and humans. The deduced FXYD7 protein contains 77 amino acids
and has no signal peptide. A potential splice variant has 80 residues.
Sweadner and Rael (2000) noted that ESTs for FXYD7 are restricted to the
nervous system.

Using Northern and Western blot analyses of rat tissues, Beguin et al.
(2002) detected a 0.7-kb Fxyd7 transcript encoding an 18-kD type I
membrane protein. Expression was restricted to brain, with highest
levels in cerebrum, followed by cerebellum, brainstem, and hippocampus,
and relatively weak expression in hypothalamus. Immunofluorescence
microscopy demonstrated colocalization with synaptophysin (SYP; 313475)
and modest colocalization with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP;
137780), indicating predominant expression in neurons and lower
expression in astroglial cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using immunoprecipitation analysis, Beguin et al. (2002) detected a
preferential association of mouse Fxyd7 with alpha-1/beta-1 isozymes of
Na,K-ATPase (see ATP1B1; 182310). Beguin et al. (2002) concluded that,
like other members of the FXYD family, which are involved in the fine
regulation of Na,K-ATPases in various tissues, FXYD7 mediates this
regulation in brain.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the FXYD7
gene to chromosome 19.

G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR 29; GPR29;;
GPRCY4;;
STRL22;;
CMKBR6
DESCRIPTION For general information about chemokines and their receptors, see CMKBR1
(601159).

CLONING

Zaballos et al. (1996) used degenerate PCR to isolate genes encoding
putative chemokine receptors. One such gene, termed CKRL3 by them,
encodes a 369-amino acid polypeptide with greatest similarity to the
family of alpha-chemokine-binding receptors. Northern blot analysis
revealed that CKRL3 is weakly expressed as a 4-kb transcript in spleen,
lymph nodes, peripheral blood lymphocytes, and appendix.

Using PCR with pools of primers based on conserved sequences in
chemokine receptors, Liao et al. (1997) cloned this gene and named it
STRL22.

GENE FUNCTION

Using degenerate oligonucleotide-based reverse transcriptase PCR, Power
et al. (1997) cloned cDNAs encoding human CMKBR6. Expression studies
showed that CMKBR6 is the receptor for MIP-3-alpha (601960) and its
activation leads to phospholipase C-dependent intracellular Ca(2+)
mobilization. Similarly, Liao et al. (1997) found that MIP-3-alpha is
the only chemokine that produces a calcium flux in CMKBR6-transfected
cells.

Using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, Homey et al.
(2000) demonstrated that MIP3A, or CCL20, and its receptor, CCR6, are
markedly upregulated in psoriasis (see 177900) and that CCL20-expressing
keratinocytes colocalize with CLA-positive (see PSGL1; 600738)
skin-infiltrating T lymphocytes in lesional psoriatic skin. By flow
cytometry analysis, they showed that circulating CLA-positive memory T
cells in both normal and psoriatic individuals expressed high levels of
surface CCR6, which was expressed 100- to 1,000-fold higher than other
chemokine receptors on this T-cell subpopulation. CCL20 was chemotactic
for CLA-positive T cells at lower concentrations in psoriatic than in
normal donor lymphocytes. ELISA and RT-PCR analysis showed that multiple
cellular constituents of the skin produce CCL20 in response to a variety
of proinflammatory mediators, including TNFA (191160)/IL1B (147720),
CD40LG (300386), IFNG (147570), and IL17 (603149).

Yang et al. (1999) showed that human beta-defensins are chemotactic for
immature dendritic cells and memory T cells. Human beta-defensin was
selectively chemotactic for cells stably transfected to express human
CCR6, a chemokine receptor preferentially expressed by immature
dendritic cells and memory T cells. The beta-defensin-induced chemotaxis
was sensitive to pertussis toxin and inhibited by antibodies to CCR6.
The binding of iodinated LARC (CCL20; 601960), the chemokine ligand for
CCR6, to CCR6-transfected cells was competitively displaced by
beta-defensin. Thus, beta-defensins may promote adaptive immune
responses by recruiting dendritic and T cells to the site of microbial
invasion through interaction with CCR6.

Reboldi et al. (2009) found that Ccr6-deficient mice were highly
resistant to induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
(EAE), a model of multiple sclerosis (MS; 126200), but became
susceptible after transfer of small numbers of Ccr6-positive T cells.
Ccr6 was required on the first wave of Il17-producing T-helper cells
(Th17 cells) entering the central nervous system (CNS) through
Ccl20-expressing epithelial cells in the choroid plexus. The
Ccr6-positive T cells triggered entry of a second wave of T cells that
migrated in large numbers into the CNS by crossing activated parenchymal
vessels. Reboldi et al. (2009) found that patients undergoing an initial
demyelinating event (the first clinical episode of MS) had significantly
higher frequencies of CCR6-positive/CD25 (IL2RA; 147730)-negative/CD4
(186940)-positive inflammatory T cells in cerebrospinal fluid than in
peripheral blood. MS patients expressed high levels of CCL20 in inflamed
tissues, in GFAP (137780)-positive astrocytes, and in choroid plexus.
Reboldi et al. (2009) proposed that CCR6 and CCL20 may represent an
evolutionarily conserved axis that regulates the entry and dissemination
of T cells into the CNS.

Klose et al. (2013) provided evidence that the transcription factor Tbet
(604895) determines the fate of a distinct lineage of CCR6-negative
ROR-gamma-t (602943)-positive innate lymphoid cells (ILCs). Postnatally
emerging CCR6-ROR-gamma-t+ ILCs upregulated Tbet, and this was
controlled by cues from the commensal microbiota and IL23 (605580). In
contrast, CCR6+ROR-gamma-t+ ILCs, which arise earlier during ontogeny,
did not express Tbet. Tbet instructed the expression of Tbet target
genes such as interferon-gamma and of the natural cytotoxicity receptor
NKp46 (604530). Mice genetically lacking Tbet showed normal development
of CCR6-ROR-gamma-t innate lymphoid cells, but these cells could not
differentiate into NKp46-expressing ROR-gamma-t+ ILCs (i.e., IL22
(605330)-producing natural killer cells) and failed to produce
interferon-gamma. The production of interferon-gamma by Tbet-expressing
CCR6-ROR-gamma-t+ ILCs was essential for the release of mucus-forming
glycoproteins required to protect the epithelial barrier against
Salmonella enterica infection. Klose et al. (2013) concluded that
coexpression of Tbet and ROR-gamma-t, which is also found in subsets of
IL17-producing T-helper cells, may be an evolutionarily conserved
transcriptional program that originally developed as part of the innate
defense against infections but that also confers an increased risk of
immune-mediated pathology.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic analysis, Liao et al. (1997) determined that, unlike most
chemokine receptor genes, CMKBR6 is encoded by more than 1 exon.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

For discussion of association of variation in the CCR6 gene with
susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis, see 180300.

MAPPING

Zaballos et al. (1996) used somatic cell hybrids to map CKRL3 to human
chromosome 6. Liao et al. (1997) used fluorescence in situ hybridization
to map the CMKBR6 gene to chromosome 6q27.

ANIMAL MODEL

Lukacs et al. (2001) showed that in a cockroach antigen (CA) model of
allergic pulmonary inflammation, mice expressed Ccl20 within hours of
challenge. Compared with these wildtype mice, Ccr6-deficient mice had
reduced airway resistance, fewer eosinophils around the airway, lower
levels of IL5 (147850), and reduced serum IgE in response to CA. Lukacs
et al. (2001) suggested that CCL20 and CCR6 may represent novel
therapeutic targets for the treatment of asthma.

Lundy et al. (2005) extended their previous findings (Lukacs et al.,
2001) by showing that attenuation of airway hyperresponsiveness in
Ccr6-/- mice following CA challenge was due in part to T cell defects,
but also to pulmonary dendritic cell defects.

Varona et al. (2001) showed that mice with a targeted deletion in Ccr6
had normal epidermal Langerhans cells but underdeveloped Peyer patches
that lacked the Cd11b (120980)/Cd11c (151510) dendritic cell subset in
the subepithelial dome. The Ccr6 -/- mice also had greater numbers of T
cells, particularly Cd4/Cd8 (see 186910) double-positive T cells, within
the intestinal mucosa. In contact hypersensitivity studies, Ccr6 -/-
mice developed more severe and more persistent inflammation. Conversely,
in delayed-type hypersensitivity assays, no inflammatory response
occurred. Varona et al. (2001) proposed that Ccr6-deficient mice have a
defect in the activation and/or migration of the Cd4-positive T-cell
subsets involved in downregulating or eliciting the inflammation
response.

To investigate the role of CCR6 in the pathogenesis of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; see 606963), Bracke et al. (2006)
exposed Ccr6 -/- and wildtype mice to cigarette smoke. Bronchoalveolar
lavage cell numbers increased in both wildtype and Ccr6 -/- mice after
subacute and chronic cigarette smoke exposure, but the numbers of
dendritic cells, activated Cd8-positive T lymphocytes, and granulocytes
did not increase as much in Ccr6 -/- mice. The attenuated inflammatory
response in Ccr6 -/- mice was associated with partial protection against
development of pulmonary emphysema, which correlated with impaired Mmp12
(601046) production. In wildtype mice, but not Ccr6 -/- mice, cigarette
smoke exposure significantly increased expression of the unique Ccr6
ligand, Ccl20, as well as Ccl2 (158105). Bracke et al. (2006) concluded
that interaction of CCR6 and CCL20 contributes to the pathogenesis of
cigarette smoke-induced COPD.

600836	TITLE *600836 CRYSTALLIN, BETA-A2; CRYBA2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The alpha-, beta-, and gamma-crystallins are major constituents of the
lens and are important for its transparency and light reflection
properties. Hereditary cataracts in humans and mice are often the result
of mutations in the genes producing these proteins. The beta-crystallin
family consists of 4 acidic (A) and 3 basic (B) members. One of these is
beta-A2 (CRYBA2) (summary by Hulsebos et al., 1995).

CLONING

Beta-A2 crystallin was identified in human by Hulsebos et al. (1995),
who designed primers based on the bovine sequence to amplify a portion
of the human gene.

By HPLC separation of beta-crystallins isolated from human lenses,
followed by peptide digestion and mass spectrometry of a protein that
coeluted with crystallin beta-A1/A3 (CRYBA1; 123610), Lapko et al.
(2003) identified crystallin beta-A2. The deduced 196-amino acid protein
had an apparent molecular mass of about 22 kD by HPLC and electrospray
ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry. The ESI mass spectrum showed 2
additional, slightly larger peaks, likely resulting from secondary
modification. Crystallin beta-A2 accounted for approximately 1.5% of
lens crystallins in both 11-day-old and adult lenses.

MAPPING

Using a portion of the human CRYBA2 gene to screen a panel of
human-rodent hybrid cell DNAs, Hulsebos et al. (1995) mapped the gene to
chromosome 2q34-q36. Interspecific backcross mapping was used to map the
mouse gene to the central portion of chromosome 1, a region with
homology of synteny to the distal half of the long arm of human
chromosome 2.

ANIMAL MODEL

Puk et al. (2011) identified the first mutation in the Cryba2 gene in
the mouse. The S46P mutation was found in a breeding colony of mice
characterized by small lenses and no changes in corneal thickness,
anterior chamber depth, or aqueous humor volume. In homozygous mice, the
mutation caused cortical cataracts and led to a total cataract at the
age of 25 weeks. Puk et al. (2011) suggested that the human CRYBA2 gene
should be considered a strong candidate gene for age-related cataracts,
and that the slightly smaller size of the lens might be recognized as an
early biomarker for age-related cataract.

612120	TITLE *612120 CELL DEATH-INDUCING DFFA-LIKE EFFECTOR C; CIDEC
;;CELL DEATH ACTIVATOR CIDE3;;
FAT-SPECIFIC PROTEIN 27; FSP27
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DNA fragmentation factor (DFF) induces the fragmentation of DNA
associated with apoptosis. A novel family of cell death-inducing DFF45
(601882)-like effectors (CIDEs), including CIDEC, can also promote
apoptosis (Liang et al., 2003). CIDEC is a lipid droplet protein
implicated in the formation of white adipocytes with unilocular lipid
droplets (Nishino et al., 2008).

CLONING

By database analysis using CIDEB (604441) as query, followed by PCR of a
human liver cDNA library, Liang et al. (2003) cloned CIDEC, which they
called CIDE3. The deduced 238-amino acid protein has a predicted
molecular mass of 26.8 kD and shares 44% and 38% identity with CIDEA
(604440) and CIDEB, respectively. Northern blot analysis detected a
1.3-kb transcript mainly in small intestine, heart, colon, and stomach,
with lower expression observed in brain, kidney, and liver. A 1.1-kb
transcript was detected in placenta. The authors identified a 164-amino
acid CIDEC isoform, which they called CIDE3-alpha, lacking the first
N-terminal 74 amino acids. Immunofluorescence analysis localized CIDEC
in a punctate manner to the cytosol.

GENE STRUCTURE

Liang et al. (2003) determined that the CIDEC gene contains 6 exons
spanning approximately 13 kb. The shorter CIDEC isoform results from
skipping of exon 3.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Liang et al. (2003) mapped the CIDEC gene
to chromosome 3p25.

GENE FUNCTION

Liang et al. (2003) overexpressed CIDEC in human 293T cells and observed
condensation of nuclei and fragmentation of DNA characteristic of
apoptosis.

Puri et al. (2007) stated that CIDEC is upregulated during adipogenesis
and is highly expressed in both white and brown adipose tissues. In
mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes, they detected a 59-fold increase in Cidec mRNA
expression during adipogenesis, consistent with previous findings.
Confocal microscopy localized Cidec to lipid droplets but not to
mitochondria, and Cidec colocalized with the known lipid droplet protein
perilipin (170290). Cidec expression in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes resulted in
increased lipid droplet size and increased accumulation of total neutral
lipids. RNAi knockdown of Cidec resulted in upregulation of basal
lipolysis and reduced the size of lipid droplets.

Keller et al. (2008) found that overexpression of mouse Fsp27 increased
apoptosis in 293T cells and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, whereas more
physiologic levels stimulated spontaneous lipid accumulation in several
cell types without induction of adipocyte genes. Increased
triacylglycerol was likely due to decreased beta oxidation of
nonesterified fatty acids. Altered flux of fatty acids into
triacylglycerol appeared to be a direct effect of Fsp27, which localized
to lipid droplets in 293T and 3T3-L1 cells. Knockdown of Fsp27 in 3T3-L1
cells decreased lipid droplet size, increased mitochondrial and lipid
droplet number, and modestly increased glucose uptake and lipolysis.
Expression of FSP27 in subcutaneous adipose tissue of human diabetics
decreased with total fat mass, but it was not associated with measures
of insulin resistance. Keller et al. (2008) concluded that FSP27 binds
to lipid droplets and regulates their enlargement.

Puri et al. (2008) observed that depletion of PPARG (601487) by
approximately 90% in 3T3-L1 adipocytes led to greater than 90% depletion
of CIDEA and CIDEC, and that treatment of lean or obese mice with the
PPARG agonist rosiglitazone markedly upregulated Cidea and Cidec
expression in white adipose tissue (WAT), increasing lipid deposition.
In both omental and subcutaneous WAT from BMI-matched obese humans,
expression of CIDEA, CIDEC, and perilipin correlated positively with
insulin sensitivity. Puri et al. (2008) concluded that CIDEA and other
lipid droplet proteins define a highly regulated pathway of triglyceride
deposition in human WAT and suggested that failure of this pathway might
result in ectopic lipid accumulation, insulin resistance, and associated
comorbidities.

Using a microarray screen, Nishino et al. (2008) showed that expression
of a dominant-negative Pparg mutant in 3T3-L1 cells downregulated
expression of Fsp27. Depletion of Fsp27 in murine cultured white
adipocytes resulted in formation of numerous small lipid droplets,
increased lipolysis, and decreased triacylglycerol storage. Conversely,
expression of Fsp27 in COS cells promoted formation of large lipid
droplets. Nishino et al. (2008) concluded that FSP27 contributes to
efficient energy storage in WAT by promoting formation of unilocular
lipid droplets.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a 19-year-old Ecuadorian girl with partial lipodystrophy-5 (FPLD5;
615238) and insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus, Rubio-Cabezas et al.
(2009) identified a homozygous truncating mutation in the CIDEC gene
(E186X; 612120.0001). The observations suggested that CIDEC is required
for unilocular lipid droplet formation and optimal energy storage in
human fat. CIDEC mutations were not found in 168 additional patients
with unexplained lipodystrophy, suggesting that it is a rare cause of
partial lipodystrophy.

ANIMAL MODEL

Nishino et al. (2008) found that Fsp27 ablation in mice reduced the
amount of epididymal and subcutaneous WAT and caused the formation of
multiple lipid droplets in white adipocytes. Fsp27-deficient mice were
protected from diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance and displayed
an increased metabolic rate due to increased mitochondrial biogenesis in
WAT.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
LIPODYSTROPHY, FAMILIAL PARTIAL, TYPE 5 (1 family)
CIDEC, GLU186TER

In a 19-year-old Ecuadorian girl with familial partial lipodystrophy-5
(FPLD5; 615238) and diabetes mellitus, Rubio-Cabezas et al. (2009)
identified a homozygous c.556G-T transversion in exon 6 of the CIDEC
gene, resulting in a glu186-to-ter (E186X) substitution predicted to
result in loss of a significant part of the CIDE-C domain. The mutation,
which was not present in 120 control alleles, was found in the
heterozygous state in the unaffected mother; DNA from the father was not
available. Expression of the mutant protein in COS cells or
preadipocytes showed that the mutant protein failed to increase lipid
droplet size compared to wildtype, consistent with a loss of function.
Whereas most of the wildtype CIDEC localized around lipid droplets,
mutant CIDEC was not, suggesting mislocalization. Adipose tissue from
the patient showed white adipocytes with multilocular lipid droplets
rather than the normal single large droplet, as well as focal increases
in mitochondrial mass. Resting metabolic rate was increased.
Rubio-Cabezas et al. (2009) noted that Cidec-null mice also have
decreased fat mass, but are protected against diet-induced obesity and
insulin resistance (Nishino et al., 2008), in contrast to their patient.
The observations suggested that CIDEC is required for unilocular lipid
droplet formation and optimal energy storage in human fat.

607042	TITLE *607042 CLN3 GENE; CLN3
;;BATTENIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The International Batten Disease Consortium (1995) isolated the CLN3
gene, which is mutated in Batten disease (CLN3; 204200). A certain
haplotype, called the '56 chromosome' haplotype, defined by the 5 allele
at D16S299 and the 6 allele at D16S298, is shared by 73% of Batten
disease chromosomes (Mitchison et al., 1994). The consortium used exon
amplification of a cosmid that contained D16S298, which yielded a
candidate gene that was disrupted by a 1-kb genomic deletion
(607042.0001) in all patients carrying the 56 chromosome. Three separate
deletions and a point mutation altering a splice site in 3 unrelated
families confirmed the candidate as the CLN3 gene. The disease gene
encodes a deduced 438-amino acid protein.

Janes et al. (1996) reported that the amino acid sequence of the CLN3
gene product predicts a hydrophobic protein with 6 transmembrane
domains. The sequence appears to contain a putative mitochondrial
targeting site at residue 11 and has 4 predicted N-glycosylation sites,
all on the predicted exoplasmic surface. A homology search identified a
yeast protein with 36% identity to the CLN3 protein. Munroe et al.
(1997) reported that all known point mutations of CLN3 are found at
sites that have identical residues in the yeast protein.

Lee et al. (1996) isolated a mouse homolog of the CLN3 gene. Like its
human counterpart, the mouse cDNA encodes a predicted 438-amino acid
polypeptide. The mouse and human proteins share 85% sequence identity.

Using an immunoprecipitation and glycosylation mutagenesis procedure,
Mao et al. (2003) determined that the human CLN3 protein contains 5
transmembrane domains, an extracellular/intraluminal N terminus, and a
cytoplasmic C terminus.

By Western blot analysis, Margraf et al. (1999) observed CLN3 at an
apparent molecular mass of 48 kD in cortical brain, pancreas, spleen,
and testis, with weaker expression in peripheral nerve. Gray matter
showed higher CLN3 expression than white matter. No protein expression
was detected in ovary, small intestine, colon, and adipose tissue.
Immunocytochemical analysis localized CLN3 in islet cells of the
pancreas. In brain, CLN3 was observed in nuclei and cytoplasmic
processes of most astrocytes, in nuclei and cytoplasm of neurons, and in
capillary endothelium. Staining was similar in all brain areas examined,
and no difference in staining was found between brains of adults and
noninfant children. Immunoelectron microscopy detected CLN2 lining
endothelial cell membranes. CLN2 was not associated with lysosomes or
mitochondria.

Rakheja et al. (2004) found that Cln3 resided on lipid rafts, or
detergent-resistant membranes, from bovine brain.

GENE STRUCTURE

Mitchison et al. (1997) reported that the CLN3 gene contains at least 15
exons and spans 15 kb. Sequence comparisons between CLN3 and homologous
ESTs suggested alternative splicing of the gene and at least 1
additional upstream exon.

MAPPING

The International Batten Disease Consortium (1995) isolated the CLN3
gene between microsatellite markers D16S288 and D16S383 on chromosome
16p12.1-p11.2.

Lee et al. (1996) mapped the mouse gene to distal chromosome 7 in a
region of syntenic homology with human 16p12.

GENE FUNCTION

Janes et al. (1996) speculated that the CLN3 gene product may function
as a chaperone involved in the folding/unfolding or assembly/disassembly
of other proteins, specifically subunit c of the ATP synthase complex.
Kremmidiotis et al. (1999) investigated the subcellular localization of
the CLN3 gene product by fusing it to green fluorescent protein (GFP) or
an 8-amino acid peptide tag and transiently transfecting it into
fibroblasts, HeLa cells, and COS-7 cells. A juxtanuclear, asymmetric
localization that correlated with the Golgi apparatus was observed in
all 3 cell types. A portion of cells exhibited a punctate vesicular
distribution throughout the cytoplasm. Further studies were performed on
a stably transfected cell line expressing only 1 copy of the CLN3-GFP
DNA construct. Fluorescence and biochemical analyses demonstrated that
the CLN3 gene product is an integral membrane protein that localizes
primarily to the Golgi apparatus.

Jarvela et al. (1999) confirmed the lysosomal localization of the CLN3
protein by immunoelectron microscopy by colocalizing it with soluble and
membrane-associated lysosomal proteins. They analyzed the intracellular
processing and localization of 2 mutants, 461-677del (607042.0001),
which is present in 85% of CLN3 alleles and causes the classic
juvenile-onset CLN3, and glu295 to lys (E295K; 607042.0005), which is a
rare missense mutation associated with an atypical form of JNCL.
Transient expression of the 2 mutants in BHK cells showed that
461-677del was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas E295K was
capable of reaching the lysosomal compartment. The CLN3 polypeptides
were expressed further in mouse primary neurons where the wildtype CLN3
protein was localized both in the cell soma and in neuronal extensions,
whereas the 461-677del mutation was arrested in the cell soma.
Colocalization of the wildtype CLN3 and E295K proteins with a synaptic
vesicle marker indicated that the CLN3 protein might participate in
synaptic vesicle transport/transmission. These data provided clear
evidence for a cellular distinction between classic and atypical forms
of Batten disease in both neural and nonneural cells.

Luiro et al. (2001) analyzed CLN3 in the mouse brain by use of in situ
hybridization, immunohistochemical staining, and Western blot analysis
of subcellular fractions. CLN3 was abundantly expressed in neuronal
cells, especially in the cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum of the
adult mouse brain. In cultured mouse retinal cells, CLN3 was not solely
localized to lysosomes, but was also found in the synaptosomes, although
not targeted to the synaptic vesicles. The latter observation led the
authors to hypothesize a potential role of CLN3 in neuronal transport
pathways.

Using surface biotinylation and antibody trapping, Mao et al. (2003)
showed that a portion of CLN3 in a human teratocarcinoma cell line
trafficked to lysosomes via the cell membrane. Inhibition of the mu-3A
subunit of the AP3 adaptor protein complex (AP3M1; 610366) increased the
amount of cell surface CLN3.

Luiro et al. (2004) found that overexpression of CLN3 induced
aggregation of the microtubule binding protein Hook1 (607820) in HeLa
cells, potentially by mediating its dissociation from the microtubules.
In vitro binding assays showed a weak interaction between Hook1 and the
cytoplasmic segments of CLN3. Receptor-mediated endocytosis was
defective in CLN3-deficient JNCL fibroblasts, linking CLN3, Hook1 and
endocytosis in the mammalian system. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments
showed that Hook1 physically interacted with endocytic Rab7 (602298),
Rab9 (300284), and Rab11 (605570), suggesting a role for Hook1 in
membrane trafficking. Luiro et al. (2004) suggested a link between CLN3
function, microtubule cytoskeleton, and endocytic membrane trafficking.

Ramirez-Montealegre and Pearce (2005) reported that lysosomes from
juvenile Batten disease lymphoblast cell lines demonstrated defective
transport of arginine. Furthermore, they showed that there was a
depletion of arginine in cells from juvenile Batten disease patients.
Ramirez-Montealegre and Pearce (2005) demonstrated that lysosomal
arginine transport in normal lysosomes was ATP, vacuolar ATPase (see
606939), and cationic dependent. Thus, both arginine and lysine are
transported by the same transport system, designated system c. However,
lysosomes from juvenile Batten disease lymphoblasts were only defective
for arginine transport. An antibody to CLN3 was able to block lysosomal
arginine transport, and transient expression of CLN3 in JNCL cells
restored lysosomal arginine transport. Ramirez-Montealegre and Pearce
(2005) suggested that the CLN3 defect in juvenile Batten disease may
affect how intracellular levels of arginine are regulated or distributed
throughout the cell.

In cultured human neuroblastoma cells, Narayan et al. (2006)
demonstrated that the CLN3 protein is a novel palmitoyl-protein delta-9
desaturase with low affinity for free fatty acids, specifically
palmitate, and high affinity for palmitoylated proteins. This specific
enzyme activity was deficient in pancreatic and brain tissue from
Cln3-deficient mice and was completely ablated by siRNA inhibition in
cultured human neuroblastoma cells. The findings indicated that the CLN3
protein plays a role in membrane-associated proteolipid modification.
Narayan et al. (2006) proposed that defects in this enzymatic activity
lead to intracellular proteolipid accumulation, neuronal cell death, and
neurodegeneration characteristic of Batten disease.

Hobert and Dawson (2007) isolated detergent-resistant membranes from
control and JNCL brains and found that JNCL-derived membranes were less
buoyant than controls. Analysis of phospholipid content showed reduced
bis(monoacylglycerol)phosphate (BMP) in JNCL-derived membranes and in
total lipids from JNCL brains. Metabolic labeling demonstrated reduced
synthesis of BMP in JNCL fibroblasts, which was restored following
complementation with wildtype CLN3. Overexpression of wildtype CLN3 also
increased BMP synthesis. Hobert and Dawson (2007) concluded that CLN3
has a role in BMP biosynthesis and in maintaining the lipid profile of
detergent-resistant membranes.

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis, in vitro protein pull-down assays, and
coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins in an SH-SY5Y human
neuroblastoma cell line, Chang et al. (2007) showed that calsenilin
(KCNIP3; 604662) interacted with the C terminus of CLN3. Overexpression
of full-length CLN3 or the isolated CLN3 C terminus suppressed cell
death triggered by pharmacologically elevated intracellular Ca(2+)
concentration. Conversely, knockdown of CLN3 via antisense cDNA
increased cell susceptibility to high Ca(2+)-triggered cell death.
Ca(2+) reduced the interaction between calsenilin and CLN3 in vitro, and
knockdown of calsenilin desensitized SH-SY5Y cells to Ca(2+)-induced
cell death. Chang et al. (2007) concluded that CLN3 regulates neuronal
cell death mediated by calsenilin.

Tuxworth et al. (2009) developed a genetic gain-of-function system in
Drosophila to identify functional pathways and interactions for CLN3.
They identified interactions between CLN3 and the Notch (NOTCH1; 190198)
and Jun (MAPK8; 601158) N-terminal kinase signaling pathways, and
described a potential role for RNA splicing and localization machinery
in regulating CLN3 function.

Vitiello et al. (2010) demonstrated that CLN3 interacts with SBDS
(607444), the protein mutated in Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome
(260400) patients. The protein-protein interaction was conserved between
Btn1 and Sdo1, the respective S. cerevisiae orthologs of CLN3 and SBDS.
It had been shown that deletion of BTN1 results in alterations in
vacuolar pH and vacuolar (H+)-ATPase (V-ATPase)-dependent H+ transport
and ATP hydrolysis. Vitiello et al. (2010) found that an Sdo1 deletion
strain had decreased vacuolar pH and V-ATPase-dependent H+ transport and
ATP hydrolysis; the alterations resulted from decreased V-ATPase subunit
expression. Overexpression of Btn1 or the presence of ionophore carbonyl
cyanide m-chlorophenil hydrazone (CCCP) caused decreased growth in yeast
lacking Sdo1. In normal cells, overexpression of Btn1 mirrored the
effect of CCCP, with both resulting in increased vacuolar pH due to
alterations in the coupling of V-ATPase-dependent H+ transport and ATP
hydrolysis. The authors proposed that Sdo1 and SBDS work to regulate
Btn1 and CLN3, respectively.

- Role in Tumorigenesis

Juvenile Batten disease is a neurodegenerative disease caused by
accelerated apoptotic death of photoreceptors and neurons resulting from
defects in the CLN3 gene. CLN3 is antiapoptotic when overexpressed in
NT2 neuronal precursor cells. Because defects in regulation of apoptosis
are involved in the development of cancer, Rylova et al. (2002)
evaluated the expression of CLN3 on both mRNA and protein levels in a
variety of cancer cell lines and solid colon cancer tissue. They showed
that CLN3 mRNA and protein are overexpressed in a variety of human
cancer cell lines. It was also upregulated in mouse melanoma and breast
carcinoma cancer cell lines. In 8 of 10 solid colon tumors, they found
CLN3 expression 22 to 330% higher than in corresponding colon control
tissue. Blocking of CLN3 expression using an adenovirus-expressing
antisense CLN3 inhibited growth and viability of cancer cells. It also
caused elevation in endogenous ceramide production through de novo
ceramide synthesis and resulted in increased apoptosis. This suggested
that antisense-CLN3 may be an option for therapy in some cancers. More
importantly, these results suggested that CLN3 is a novel molecular
target for cancer drug discovery.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The International Batten Disease Consortium (1995) demonstrated that the
mutation responsible for 73% of Batten disease (CLN3; 204200)
chromosomes, as identified by the 56 haplotype, is a genomic deletion of
1.02 kb (607042.0001) in the CLN3 gene.

Munroe et al. (1997) identified homozygosity for the common 1.02-kb CLN3
deletion in 139 (74%) of 188 unrelated patients with Batten disease; 41
were compound heterozygous for the deletion and another CLN3 mutation.
By SSCP analysis and direct sequencing, Munroe et al. (1997) found 19
novel mutations in the CLN3 gene: 6 missense mutations, 5 nonsense
mutations, 3 small deletions, 3 small insertions, 1 intronic mutation,
and 1 splice site mutation. This report brought the total number of
known disease-associated mutations in CLN3 to 23. All patients
homozygous for mutations predicted to give rise to truncated proteins
were found to have classic juvenile-onset CLN3. However, 4 patients who
were compound heterozygotes for a missense mutation and a 1.02-kb
deletion were found to display an atypical phenotype that was dominated
by visual failure rather than by severe neurodegeneration. All missense
mutations were found to affect residues conserved between the human
protein and homologs in diverse species.

Lauronen et al. (1999) presented the phenotypes of 10 different Finnish
compound heterozygotes with the common 1.02-kb deletion (607042.0001)
and 1 of 5 rare CLN3 mutations on the other chromosome. They identified
a novel mutation, resulting in a deletion of exons 10 through 13, in 3
families with a total of 6 patients. This mutation differed from that
described in 607042.0002 in that it spared marker D16S298.

Mole et al. (1999) tabulated the mutations that had been identified in
the various CLNs; they reported 25 mutations and 2 polymorphisms
associated with CLN3.

Persaud-Sawin et al. (2002) demonstrated that CLN3-deficient
immortalization of lymphoblasts homozygous for the common 1.02-kb
deletion (607042.0001) grew at a slower rate, and showed increased
sensitivity to etoposide-induced apoptosis, supporting the notion that
CLN3 may negatively regulate apoptosis. Protection from
etoposide-induced apoptosis was evident and the cell growth rate was
restored following transfection of JNCL lymphoblasts with mutant CLN3
cDNA that included exons 11 or 13. Deletion of the glycosylation sites
71-74 and 310-313, and mutations within the highly conserved amino acid
stretches 184-195, 291-295, or 330-337, resulted in slowed growth and
susceptibility to apoptosis.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Haskell et al. (2000) examined the effect of naturally occurring point
mutations on the intracellular localization of CLN3, their ability to
complement the CLN3-deficient yeast btn1-delta, and a putative
farnesylation motif thought to be involved in CLN3 trafficking. All 6
missense mutations studied, like wildtype CLN3, were highly associated
with lysosome-associated membrane protein II (309060) in nonneuronal
cells and with synaptophysin (313475) in neuronal cell lines. In a yeast
functional assay, point mutations correlating with a mild phenotype also
demonstrated CLN3 activity, whereas the mutations associated with severe
disease failed to restore CLN3 function completely. CLN3 with a mutation
in the farnesylation motif trafficked normally but was functionally
impaired. The authors concluded that point mutations causative of Batten
disease do not affect protein trafficking but rather exert their effects
by impairing protein function.

ANIMAL MODEL

Cotman et al. (2002) introduced the common 1-kb genomic DNA deletion
into the murine CLN3 homolog to create Cln3 (ex7/8) knockin mice. This
allele produced alternatively spliced mRNAs, including a variant
predicting a nontruncated protein, as well as mutant battenin that was
detected in the cytoplasm of cells in the periphery and CNS. Moreover,
Cln3 (ex7/8) homozygotes exhibited accrual of JNCL-like membrane
deposits from before birth, in proportion to battenin levels, which were
high in liver and select neuronal populations. Although liver enzymes
and CNS development were normal, Cln3 (ex7/8) mice displayed recessively
inherited degenerative changes in retina, cerebral cortex, and
cerebellum, as well as neurologic deficits and premature death. The
authors concluded that the harmful impact of the common JNCL mutation on
the CNS was not well correlated with membrane deposition per se,
suggesting instead a specific battenin activity that is essential for
the survival of CNS neurons.

In brains of homozygous Cln3(ex7/8) mice, Cao et al. (2006) found
upregulation of the autophagy marker Lc3 II (see 601242) and
downregulation of the autophagy inhibitor Mtor (FRAP1; 601231). Isolated
autophagic vacuoles and lysosomes from homozygous Cln3(ex7/8) mice were
less mature in their ultrastructural morphology than wildtype
organelles, and mitochondrial ATPase subunit c (see ATP5G1; 603192)
accumulated in autophagic vacuoles, similar to that seen in JNCL. Cao et
al. (2006) also observed mitochondrial ATPase subunit c accumulation in
autophagic vacuoles in normal aging mice. Lc3-positive vesicles isolated
from Cln3(ex7/8) cerebellar cells showed altered trafficking and reduced
fusion of endocytic and lysosomal vesicles upon stimulation of
autophagy. Stimulation of autophagy did not significantly impact cell
survival in homozygous Cln3(ex7/8) cells, but inhibition of autophagy
led to cell death. Cao et al. (2006) concluded that autophagy is
disrupted in JNCL, likely at the level of autophagic vacuolar
maturation, and they proposed that activation of autophagy may be a
prosurvival feedback response in the disease process.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CEROID LIPOFUSCINOSIS, NEURONAL, 3
CLN3, 1.02-KB DEL

The International Batten Disease Consortium (1995) demonstrated that the
mutation responsible for 73% of Batten disease (CLN3; 204200)
chromosomes as identified by the 56 haplotype is a genomic deletion of
1.02 kb, including 217 bp of the open reading frame (nucleotides
598-814), corresponding to 2 exons. Deletion of these 217 bp of coding
sequence produces a frameshift, generating a TAA termination codon 84 bp
downstream of the deletion junction. The predicted translation product
is a truncated protein of 181 amino acids consisting of the first 153
residues of the protein, followed by 28 novel amino acids before the
stop codon.

In Finland, 90% of patients with Batten disease carry the 1.02-kb
deletion. Jarvela et al. (1996) developed a rapid diagnostic solid-phase
minisequencing test to detect this deletion.

This 1.02-kb deletion in homozygous form always causes a severe
phenotype, including blindness, epilepsy, dementia, and early death at
approximately 24 years of age (Munroe et al., 1997; Jarvela et al.,
1997).

Kitzmuller et al. (2008) demonstrated that the common 1.02-kb deletion
retains residual function. Two mutant CLN3 transcripts were present in
patient cells homozygous for the mutation: the major transcript encoded
a truncated protein encoding residues 1 through 153 followed by 28
additional amino acids, and the minor transcript encoded a protein that
spliced exon 6 to exon 10 with restoration of the reading frame after
exon 10. When RNA silencing was used to deplete these transcripts in
patients' cells, the lysosomes significantly increased in size,
confirming that the protein was functional. Overexpression of mutant
CLN3 transcript consistently caused lysosomes to decrease in size.
Studies in mouse cell models and yeast confirmed that the corresponding
mutant transcripts retained significant function. The majority of the
mutant 1.02-kb deletion CLN3 protein was retained within the endoplasmic
reticulum. Kitzmuller et al. (2008) concluded that the common mutant
CLN3 protein retains significant function and that JNCL is a
mutation-specific disease phenotype. The residual function likely
explains why this form of CLN shows later onset and less severe clinical
manifestations compared to other forms of CLN.

CEROID LIPOFUSCINOSIS, NEURONAL, 3
CLN3, 3-KB DEL, NT928

In a Finnish patient with Batten disease (204200), the International
Batten Disease Consortium (1995) identified compound heterozygosity for
2 deletions in the CLN3 gene: the 1.02-kb deletion (607042.0001) and a
3-kb deletion resulting in a 266-bp coding sequence deletion
(nucleotides 928-1193), resulting in a truncated protein with the first
263 amino acids of CLN3 followed by 28 novel amino acids before a stop
codon.

.0003
CEROID LIPOFUSCINOSIS, NEURONAL, 3
CLN3, 6-KB DEL

In a Batten disease (204200) patient of Moroccan origin, Taschner et al.
(1995) demonstrated homozygosity for a deletion in the CLN3 gene. The
International Batten Disease Consortium (1995) reported that this
patient had a 6-kb deletion.

.0004
CEROID LIPOFUSCINOSIS, NEURONAL, 3
CLN3, IVSDS, G-C, +1/76-BP DEL

The International Batten Disease Consortium (1995) described a Finnish
patient, L198Pa, with Batten disease (204200) who was a compound
heterozygote for one '56 chromosome' (607042.0001) and one '76
chromosome' (D16S988/D16S298). They found a deletion of a 73-bp exon
corresponding to bases 598-670 of the cDNA. Nucleotide sequence analysis
showed a G-to-C transversion at +1 of the splice donor site following
the exon. The father was a heterozygous carrier of the mutation. The
patient had an uneventful birth and early childhood. Progressive visual
failure began at age 7. At age 9, she showed an abnormal MRI. Vacuolated
lymphocytes were repeatedly observed, and electron microscopy of a
rectal biopsy specimen showed inclusions typical of Batten disease. She
was placed on sodium valproate medication at age 9, when she experienced
her only seizure. Repeat examination at the age of 13 showed good motor
function but mental decline that had been relatively fast.

.0005
CEROID LIPOFUSCINOSIS, NEURONAL, 3, PROTRACTED
CLN3, GLU295LYS

In 2 sibs with a rare, protracted form of juvenile-onset CLN3 (204200),
Wisniewski et al. (1998) identified compound heterozygosity for 2
mutations in the CLN3 gene: a 1.02-kb deletion (607042.0001) and a
1020G-A transition, resulting in a glu295-to-lys (E295K) substitution.
Both sibs had disease onset at age 5 years, but the sister lived until
age 51 and the brother was still living at age 39.

.0006
CEROID LIPOFUSCINOSIS, NEURONAL, 3, PROTRACTED
CLN3, TYR199TER

In 5 sibs, born of consanguineous Lebanese parents, with a protracted
form of juvenile-onset CLN3 (204200), Sarpong et al. (2009) identified a
homozygous 597C-A transversion in exon 8 of the CLN3 gene, resulting in
a tyr199-to-ter (Y199X) substitution and loss of 239 C-terminal amino
acids. RT-PCR analysis detected the mutant transcript, indicating that
it was not degraded by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The Y199X mutation
was identified in heterozygosity in both parents and 4 sibs but not in
200 control alleles. In this family, onset of the disorder occurred at 4
to 5 years of age, with affected children becoming silent, taciturn, and
irritable. Visual loss occurred between 6 and 9 years, epilepsy between
10 and 15 years, and insidious onset of a movement disorder soon after.
However, all were able to walk independently until age 20 years. The
diagnosis was confirmed by pathologic studies.

604881	TITLE *604881 RABPHILIN 3A-LIKE; RPH3AL
;;NOC2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a DNA fragment encoding the Rab3A (179490)-binding domain of a
mouse rabphilin-3A (RPH3A; 612159) cDNA, Kotake et al. (1997) probed a
rat islet cDNA library under low stringency and identified rat Rph3al,
which they designated Noc2. A full-length Noc2 clone was isolated from a
rat insulin-secreting cell line cDNA library. The Noc2 cDNA encodes a
302-amino acid protein that shows 40.7% amino acid identity and 77.9%
similarity to the N-terminal region of rat rabphilin-3A. However, it
lacks the C2 domains, and hence the Noc2 (no C2 domain) designation.
Noc2 contains 1 potential protein kinase A and 3 potential protein
kinase C phosphorylation sites. RNA blot analysis revealed that a single
2.2- or 2.6-kb transcript of Noc2 is expressed at very high levels in
pancreatic islets, and at low to moderate or high levels in other
endocrine tissues and hormone-secreting cell lines, but at very low
levels in brain. Screening a mouse embryonic cDNA library with the yeast
2-hybrid system, Kotake et al. (1997) showed that Noc2 interacts with
the LIM domain-containing protein zyxin (602002), a component of the
cytoskeleton. The authors suggested that Noc2 is probably involved in
regulated exocytosis in endocrine cells by interacting with the
cytoskeleton.

Using cDNA selection, Smith et al. (1999) identified a human transcript
spanning a common deletion on 17p13.3 found in approximately 40% of
medulloblastomas. The full-length coding sequence predicted a 315-amino
acid protein displaying 77% amino acid identity with the rat Noc2
(Rph3al) protein. Northern blot analysis detected moderate to high
expression of a 2.6-kb RPH3AL transcript in thyroid, ovary, stomach,
heart, pancreas, skeletal muscle, kidney, and liver.

GENE STRUCTURE

Smith et al. (1999) determined that the RPH3AL gene contains 9 exons.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Smith et al. (1999) determined that at least 1 exon of the RPH3AL gene
maps within the common 9-kb deletion on chromosome 17p13.3 found in
medulloblastomas. However, they found no mutations in this gene in 33
tumor samples with allelic loss of 17p13, including 10 medulloblastomas,
14 follicular thyroid cancers, and 9 ovarian cancers.

606084	TITLE *606084 CDC42 EFFECTOR PROTEIN 1; CDC42EP1
;;CEP1;;
BONE MARROW STROMAL/ENDOTHELIAL CELL PROTEIN, 55-KD; MSE55
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Hemonectin is an extracellular matrix cytoadhesive protein that promotes
the attachment of developing bone marrow granulocytic cells to bone
marrow stroma. By immunoscreening an endothelial cell cDNA library with
a polyclonal anti-rabbit hemonectin antibody and probing an
oligo(dT)-primed library, Bahou et al. (1992) obtained a cDNA encoding
MSE55. Sequence analysis predicted that the 391-amino acid serum protein
lacks a signal peptide but contains a series of 8 proline/alanine
repeats as well as EF-hand motifs. Southern blot analysis suggested that
the MSE55 gene is conserved in primates, dogs, and ducks. Northern blot
analysis detected a 2.5-kb MSE55 transcript in endothelial and K562
cells; expression was not detected in monocytic, myeloid,
erythroleukemic, or lymphocytic cell lines. Immunoblot analysis showed
expression of a 55-kD protein in endothelial cell lines and serum.
Because antibody raised against MSE55 did not recognize hemonectin and
anti-hemonectin antibody did not react with the recombinant protein,
Bahou et al. (1992) concluded that hemonectin and MSE55 are distinct.

GENE FUNCTION

Burbelo et al. (1995) identified a 16-amino acid CDC42 (116952)/RAC
(602048) interactive-binding (CRIB) region in a number of kinase and
nonkinase proteins, including MSE55. MSE55, a nonkinase, bound more
strongly to the GTP form of CDC42 than to RAC. Burbelo et al. (1999)
showed that MSE55 increases membrane actin polymerization and induces
the formation of long, actin-based protrusions in fibroblasts. They
concluded that MSE55 is a CDC42 effector protein that mediates actin
cytoskeleton reorganization at the plasma membrane.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the MSE55
gene to chromosome 22 (TMAP sts-R52295).

609131	TITLE *609131 CLAUDIN 7; CLDN7
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Claudins, such as CLDN7, are involved in the formation of tight
junctions between epithelial cells. Tight junctions restrict lateral
diffusion of lipids and membrane proteins, and thereby physically define
the border between the apical and basolateral compartments of epithelial
cells (Zheng et al., 2003).

CLONING

Morita et al. (1999) cloned mouse Cldn7. Northern blot analysis of
several mouse tissues detected highest Cldn7 expression in kidney and
lung.

By subtractive hybridization to identify genes associated with PSA
(KLK3; 176820) production in prostate cell lines, followed by screening
cDNA libraries derived from a PSA-positive cell line and 2 prostate
tumors, Zheng et al. (2003) cloned 2 splice variants of CLDN7. The
variants differ in their transcriptional initiation sites and 3-prime
UTRs. One transcript encodes a deduced 211-amino acid protein containing
cytoplasmic N and C termini, 4 transmembrane segments, and 2
extracellular domains. The other transcript contains extra sequence that
introduces a stop codon within the open reading frame, resulting in a
deduced 158-amino acid protein containing 3 transmembrane segments and a
truncated second extracellular domain. RT-PCR detected the transcript
encoding the full-length protein in all normal kidney, lung, and
prostate tissues tested. The transcript encoding the truncated protein
predominated in some normal prostate samples, but was otherwise less
abundant than the full-length transcript. Following transfection in
embryonic kidney and prostate cells, both proteins were expressed at the
cell membrane.

Coyne et al. (2003) determined that human bronchi and bronchioles
express CLDN1 (603718), CLDN3 (602910), CLDN4 (602909), CLDN5 (602101),
and CLDN7. CLDN1 and CLDN4 localized to the apical tight junction region
and in lateral intercellular junctions, with staining surrounding basal
cells that anchor the columnar epithelium to the basal lamina. In
contrast, CLDN3 and CLDN5 localized exclusively to the apical-most
region of the tight junction. CLDN7 colocalized with ZO1 (TJP1; 601009)
in lateral intercellular junctions, with little or no staining near
tight junctions.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a reporter plasmid driven by the PSA promoter, Zheng et al. (2003)
found that expression of either the full-length or truncated CLDN7
protein could activate transcription in a PSA-expressing prostate cell
line. Overexpression of the truncated protein inhibited transcription.
No transcription was activated following transfection into a
non-PSA-producing prostate cell line, suggesting the requirement of
other factors. Expression of full-length CLDN7 was highly androgen
dependent, with maximum expression at physiologic dihydrotestosterone
(DHT) concentrations. DHT concentrations 3- to 10-times higher inhibited
CLDN7 expression.

Using RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, Kominsky et al. (2003) found
that expression of CLDN7 was lower in invasive ductal carcinomas (IDCs)
of the breast than in normal breast epithelium. Immunohistochemical
analysis indicated that loss of CLDN7 expression correlated with
histologic grade of IDCs and ductal carcinomas in situ, with CLDN7 loss
predominantly in high-grade lesions. CLDN7 expression was lost in 13 of
17 cases of lobular carcinoma in situ, which is defined by cellular
discohesion. Inducing the dissociation of breast carcinoma cell lines by
treatment with HGF (142409) resulted in loss of CLDN7 expression.
Silencing of CLDN7 correlated with promoter hypermethylation in breast
cancer cell lines, but not in IDCs.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the CLDN7
gene to chromosome 17 (TMAP WIAF-2127).

604270	TITLE *604270 LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN RECEPTOR-RELATED PROTEIN 4; LRP4
;;MULTIPLE EPIDERMAL GROWTH FACTOR-LIKE DOMAINS 7; MEGF7
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The domain that characterizes epidermal growth factor (EGF; 131530)
consists of approximately 50 amino acids with 3 disulfide bonds.
EGF-like domains are believed to play a critical role in a number of
extracellular events, including cell adhesion and receptor-ligand
interactions. Proteins with EGF-like domains often consist of more than
1,000 amino acids, have multiple copies of the EGF-like domain, and
contain additional domains known to be involved in specific
protein-protein interactions. To identify proteins containing EGF-like
domains, Nakayama et al. (1998) searched a database of long cDNA
sequences randomly selected from a human brain cDNA library for those
that encode an EGF-like motif. They identified several partial cDNAs
encoding novel proteins with EGF-like domains, such as LRP4, which they
named MEGF7. The predicted partial LRP4 protein contains 2 EGF-like
domains, a calcium binding-type EGF-like domain, 3 LDL receptor-type
EGF-like domains, 4 YWTD spacer regions, a transmembrane domain, a
cytoplasmic NPXY motif, which is required for clustering and
internalization of LDL receptors (e.g., 603507), and a cytoplasmic tSXV
motif, which anchors proteins with a PDZ domain. The sequence and domain
organization of LRP4 shows significant similarities to those of members
of the LDL receptor family. Northern blot analysis detected rat Megf7
expression in several regions of the brain.

Using immunohistochemical analysis of human femoral neck and mouse
femora, Leupin et al. (2011) showed that LRP4 was expressed in
osteoblasts and osteocytes, but not in osteoclasts.

MAPPING

Using a radiation hybrid mapping panel, Nakayama et al. (1998) mapped
the LRP4 gene to 11p12-p11.2.

GENE FUNCTION

Using tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry of proteins
isolated from HEK293 and rat UMR-106 osteoblastic cells, Leupin et al.
(2011) found that sclerostin (SOST; 605740) interacted with LRP4, LRP5
(603506), and LRP6 (603507). ELISA experiments confirmed a
dose-dependent interaction between recombinant LRP4 and sclerostin.
Mutation analysis revealed that membrane localization mediated by the
beta-propeller domain of LRP4 was required for the interaction.
Overexpression of LRP4 in HEK293 cells or C28a2 human chondrocytes
enhanced sclerostin-mediated inhibition of WNT1 (164820) signaling,
whereas knockdown of LRP4 mRNA in HEK293 cells via RNA interference
reduced sclerostin- but not DKK1 (605189)-mediated inhibition of WNT
signaling. Knockdown of Lrp4 significantly blocked sclerostin inhibition
of bone mineralization in mouse bone marrow stromal cells.

LRP4 is a low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family member that
forms a complex with MuSK (601296), binds neural agrin (103320), and
stimulates MuSK kinase activity. Yumoto et al. (2012) showed that LRP4
also functions as a direct muscle-derived retrograde signal for early
steps in presynaptic differentiation. They demonstrated that LRP4 is
necessary, independent of MuSK (601296) activation, for presynaptic
differentiation in vivo, and showed that LRP4 binds to motor axons and
induces clustering of synaptic vesicle and active zone proteins. Thus,
LRP4 acts bidirectionally and coordinates synapse formation by binding
agrin, activating MuSK and stimulating postsynaptic differentiation, and
functioning in turn as a muscle-derived retrograde signal that is
necessary and sufficient for presynaptic differentiation.

- Reviews

In their review, Ohazama et al. (2010) noted that communication between
mesenchymal and epithelial cells via multiple signaling pathways
controls development of craniofacial organs, notably teeth. In mouse
teeth, Wise (SOSTDC1; 609675) is expressed mainly in mesenchymal cells,
whereas Lrp4 is expressed exclusively in epithelial cells. Mutations in
either Wise or Lrp4 in mice produce multiple and identical abnormalities
in tooth development linked to alterations in Bmp (see 112262) and Wnt
(see 606359) signaling. Ohazama et al. (2010) hypothesized that WISE and
LRP4 provide a novel method of extracellular communication between
epithelial and mesenchymal cells based on integration of Wnt and BMP
pathways.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Cenani-Lenz Syndactyly Syndrome

In 12 unrelated consanguineous families with Cenani-Lenz syndactyly
syndrome (CLSS; 212780) mapping to chromosome 11p11.2-q13.1, Li et al.
(2010) sequenced the positional and functional candidate gene LRP4 and
identified homozygous and compound heterozygous missense and splice site
mutations that segregated with disease (see, e.g.,
604270.0001-604270.0008). Functional studies demonstrated that the known
antagonistic effect of LRP4 on LRP6-mediated activation of canonical WNT
(164820) signaling was lost with the mutations.

- Sclerosteosis 2

In 2 patients with sclerosteosis-2 (SOST2; 614305), Leupin et al. (2011)
identified heterozygosity and homozygosity, respectively, for missense
mutations in the LRP4 gene (604270.0009-604270.0010). Both mutations
affected highly conserved residues in the third propeller of the
extracellular domain of LRP4; the authors noted that none of the
reported LRP4 mutations causing Cenani-Lenz syndrome were located within
the third propeller domain.

ANIMAL MODEL

Johnson et al. (2005) disrupted the Lrp4 gene in mice and found that
homozygous Lrp4-deficient mice were growth retarded with fully penetrant
polysyndactyly in their fore and hind limbs and partially penetrant
abnormalities of tooth development. Ectopic expression and aberrant
signaling of several molecules involved in limb patterning, including
Fgf8 (600483), Shh (600725), Bmp2 (112261), Bmp4 (112262), and Wnt7a
(601570), as well as the Wnt- and Bmp-responsive transcription factors
Lmx1b (602575) and Msx1 (142983), resulted in reduced apoptosis and
symmetric dorsal and ventral expansions of the apical ectodermal ridge.
Abnormal signaling from the apical ectodermal ridge preceded ectopic
chondrocyte condensation and subsequent fusion and duplication of digits
in the Megf7 knockouts. Megf7 could antagonize canonic Wnt signaling in
vitro. Johnson et al. (2005) concluded that MEGF7 may play a role as a
modulator of cellular signaling pathways involving WNT, BMP, and FGF
family members and SHH.

Simon-Chazottes et al. (2006) identified 2 recessive mutations in the
mouse Lrp4 gene that caused polysyndactyly. The digitation anormale
(dan) mutation arose from insertion of a retrovirus within the first
intron of the Lrp4 gene, and it appeared to be null or, at least, a
severe hypomorph. The malformed digits (mdig) mutation was an A-to-T
transversion at the 3-prime splice site of exon 15 that led to skipping
of exon 15 and expression of a shorter mRNA encoding a protein lacking 1
YWTD spacer domain.

Johnson et al. (2006) and Duchesne et al. (2006) reported mutations in
the bovine Lrp4 gene that caused syndactyly.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CENANI-LENZ SYNDACTYLY SYNDROME
LRP4, ASP529ASN

In 3 unrelated consanguineous Turkish families with Cenani-Lenz
syndactyly syndrome (CLSS; 212780), including a family previously
reported by Seven et al. (2000), Li et al. (2010) identified
homozygosity for a 1585G-A transition in exon 13 of the LRP4 gene,
resulting in an asp529-to-asn (D529N) substitution. The D529N mutation
segregated with disease and was not found in at least 250 controls.
Haplotype analysis confirmed that D529N is a common founder mutation in
Turkish CLSS patients. Dual luciferase reporter assay in transiently
transfected HEK293T cells demonstrated that the D529N mutation abolished
the antagonistic LRP4 effect on LRP6 (603507)-mediated activation of WNT
(164820)/beta-catenin (116806) signaling. In addition, cell-surface
biotinylation studies revealed that the D529N mutant LRP4 receptor
failed to be efficiently transported to the plasma membrane. Elcioglu
(2010) noted that 1 of the unrelated consanguineous Turkish families was
originally reported by Seven et al. (2000).

.0002
CENANI-LENZ SYNDACTYLY SYNDROME
LRP4, ASP137ASN

In 2 unrelated consanguineous Egyptian families with Cenani-Lenz
syndactyly syndrome (CLSS; 212780), 1 of which was previously reported
by Temtamy et al. (2003), Li et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for a
409G-A transition in exon 4 of the LRP4 gene, resulting in an
asp137-to-asn (D137N) substitution. The D137N mutation segregated with
disease and was not found in at least 250 controls. Although
cell-surface biotinylation studies revealed that D137N mutant LRP4
receptors failed to be efficiently transported to the plasma membrane,
dual luciferase reporter assay in transiently transfected HEK293T cells
demonstrated some residual antagonistic LRP4 effect on LRP6
(603507)-mediated activation of WNT (164820)/beta-catenin (116806)
signaling with D137N.

In a female patient with Cenani-Lenz syndactyly syndrome (CLSS; 212780)
from a consanguineous Pakistani family originally reported by Bacchelli
et al. (2001), Li et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for a 547+1G-A
transition in intron 6 of the LRP4 gene. The mutation was not found in
the parents or in at least 250 controls.

.0004
CENANI-LENZ SYNDACTYLY SYNDROME
LRP4, CYS160TYR

In a male patient with Cenani-Lenz syndactyly syndrome (CLSS; 212780)
from a consanguineous Turkish family originally reported by Elcioglu et
al. (1997), Li et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for a 479G-A of
exon 5 of the LRP4 gene, resulting in a cys160-to-tyr (C160Y)
substitution. The C160Y mutation was not found in unaffected family
members or in at least 250 controls. Dual luciferase reporter assay in
transiently transfected HEK293T cells demonstrated that the C160Y
mutation abolished the antagonistic LRP4 effect on LRP6
(603507)-mediated activation of WNT (164820)/beta-catenin (116806)
signaling. In addition, cell-surface biotinylation studies revealed that
the C160Y mutant LRP4 receptor failed to be efficiently transported to
the plasma membrane. Li et al. (2010) attributed this patient to an
original report by Seven et al. (2000); however, Elcioglu (2010) noted
that this patient was originally reported by Elcioglu et al. (1997).

CENANI-LENZ SYNDACTYLY SYNDROME
LRP4, ASP449ASN

In a female patient and her niece with Cenani-Lenz syndactyly syndrome
(CLSS; 212780) from a consanguineous Turkish family originally reported
by Percin and Percin (2003), Li et al. (2010) identified homozygosity
for a 1345G-A transition in exon 12 of the LRP4 gene, resulting in an
asp449-to-asn (D449N) substitution. The D449N mutation was not found in
unaffected family members or in at least 250 controls. Dual luciferase
reporter assay in transiently transfected HEK293T cells demonstrated
that the D449N mutation abolished the antagonistic LRP4 effect on LRP6
(603507)-mediated activation of WNT (164820)/beta-catenin (116806)
signaling. In addition, cell-surface biotinylation studies revealed that
the D449N mutant LRP4 receptor failed to be efficiently transported to
the plasma membrane.

al. (2008), Li et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for a 1382A-C
transversion in exon 12 of the LRP4 gene, resulting in a thr461-to-pro
(T461P) substitution in a highly conserved region. The mutation was not
found in her unaffected parents or in matched controls.

In a female fetus with Cenani-Lenz syndactyly syndrome (CLSS; 212780)
from a consanguineous Turkish family, Li et al. (2010) identified
compound heterozygosity for a G-to-A transition in intron 2 (200-9G-A)
of the LRP4 gene, resulting in a 7-bp insertion and premature
termination, and a 4959G-C transversion in exon 34 (604270.0008) of the
LRP4 gene, resulting in skipping of exon 34 and premature termination.

SCLEROSTEOSIS 2
LRP4, TRP1186SER

In a Spanish man with sclerosteosis-2 (SOST2; 614305), originally
described by Bueno et al. (1994), Leupin et al. (2011) identified
heterozygosity for a de novo 3557G-C transversion in exon 27 of the LRP4
gene, resulting in a trp1186-to-ser (W1186S) substitution at a highly
conserved residue in the third propeller of the extracellular domain.
The mutation was not found in his unaffected parents and children, or in
110 controls, including 56 Spanish individuals. Membranes isolated from
transfected HEK293 cells expressed normal levels of mutant W1186S LRP4,
but the mutant protein was completely inactive in enhancing
sclerostin-mediated inhibition of WNT signaling.

SCLEROSTEOSIS 2
LRP4, ARG1170TRP

In a Greek woman with sclerosteosis-2 (614305), originally reported by
Itin et al. (2001), Leupin et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for a
3508C-T transition in exon 24 of the LRP4 gene, resulting in an
arg1170-to-trp (R1170W) substitution at a highly conserved residue in
the third propeller of the extracellular domain. The mutation was not
found in his unaffected parents and children or in 110 European
controls. Membranes isolated from transfected HEK293 cells expressed
normal levels of mutant R1170W LRP4, but the mutant protein was
completely inactive in enhancing sclerostin-mediated inhibition of WNT
signaling.

606436	TITLE *606436 SYNAPTOTAGMIN 12; SYT12
;;SYNAPTOTAGMIN-RELATED GENE 1, RAT, HOMOLOG OF; SRG1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SYT12 is a member of a family of proteins involved in the regulation of
transmitter release in the nervous system (Fernandez-Chacon et al.,
2001). The membrane-associated synaptic SYT12 protein in rat is under
thyroid hormone control during brain development (Thompson, 1996).

CLONING

Thompson (1996) used subtractive hybridization coupled with PCR
amplification to screen for thyroid hormone-responsive genes expressed
in rat cerebellum from postnatal days 10 through 15. She reported the
isolation and characterization of one such gene, Srg1, encoding a novel
protein related to synaptotagmin (see 185605). The Srg1 C-terminal
region, like those of other members of the synaptotagmin family,
consists of 2 C2 domains, which are related to the regulatory domain of
protein kinase C (see 176960). Also characteristic of synaptotagmins,
the Srg1 open reading frame lacks a signal sequence but has a
hydrophobic region near the N terminus, a putative transmembrane domain.
Srg1 shares between 26 and 37% amino acid sequence identity with other
members of the synaptotagmin family within the C-terminal region.
Thompson (1996) examined adult and neonatal rat tissues by Northern blot
analysis and detected Srg1 expression exclusively within the nervous
system. In situ hybridization demonstrated Srg1 expression in the
internal granule cell layer of the cerebellum. High levels of expression
were also found in cortex, caudate putamen, hippocampus, thalamus,
piriform cortex, and amygdala.

GENE FUNCTION

Thompson (1996) demonstrated that Syt12 is rapidly inducible by thyroid
hormone and that the timing of its expression is consistent with
regulation by thyroid hormone during development. Thompson (1996)
concluded that SYT12 is likely part of a cascade of gene activation
induced by thyroid hormone that is critical for central nervous system
organization and development. Regulation by thyroid hormone is not a
feature common to all members of the synaptotagmin family; Thompson
(1996) suggested that SYT12 may have unique functions among the
synaptotagmins.

Itoh et al. (2001) showed that Srg1 was markedly reduced in the
cerebellum of mice heterozygous for a targeted mutation in the Thra1
gene (190120).

NOMENCLATURE

Craxton (2001) referred to the human SYT11 (608741) and SYT12 genes as
SYT12 and SYT11, respectively.

The rat and mouse Syt12 genes were previously designated
synaptotagmin-related gene-1 and symbolized Srg1.

607245	TITLE *607245 ADAPTOR-RELATED PROTEIN COMPLEX 4, BETA-1 SUBUNIT; AP4B1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The heterotetrameric adaptor protein (AP) complexes sort integral
membrane proteins at various stages of the endocytic and secretory
pathways. AP4 is composed of 2 large chains, beta-4 (AP4B1) and
epsilon-4 (AP4E1; 607244), a medium chain, mu-4 (AP4M1; 602296), and a
small chain, sigma-4 (AP4S1; 607243).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for homologs of the beta subunits of AP
complexes, followed by 5-prime RACE of a skeletal muscle cDNA library,
Dell'Angelica et al. (1999) obtained a full-length cDNA encoding AP4B1.
The deduced 739-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of
about 83 kD and contains an N-terminal 'trunk' region, a
solvent-accessible random coil 'hinge' region, and a C-terminal 'ear'
domain with a high alpha helix content. Homology with other beta
subunits is restricted to the N-terminal trunk region, where AP4B1
shares 28% identity with mammalian Ap1b1 (600157) and Ap2b1 (601025) and
21% identity with human AP3B1 (603401) and AP3B2 (602166). Northern blot
analysis revealed ubiquitous expression of a 2.5-kb transcript; a minor
6-kb species was detected in some tissues. Western blot analysis of HeLa
cell lysates confirmed an apparent molecular mass of 83 kD, and
fractionation studies revealed that it can partition as both a cytosolic
and a membrane protein. The membrane portion could be partially
extracted with high salt, indicating that AP4B1 is a peripheral membrane
protein. Gel filtration of human fibroblast cytosol revealed that AP4B1
is part of a 280-kD complex containing other proteins of 140, 50, and 17
kD. Western blot analysis identified these proteins as AP4E1, AP4M1, and
AP4S1, respectively. Immunolocalization of AP4B1 in HeLa cells indicated
that the AP4 complex associates with the trans-Golgi network or an
adjacent structure. This association was sensitive to brefeldin-A
treatment, indicating that the membrane localization of AP4 is dependent
upon the small GTP-binding protein ARF1 (103180).

By searching an EST database and screening a brain cDNA library, Hirst
et al. (1999) isolated a cDNA encoding AP4B1. The predicted AP4B1
protein contains several motifs shared with other AP beta subunits,
including a WIIGEY motif at amino acid 500 and a KKLVYLY motif near the
N terminus. They noted that AP4B1 is smaller that AP1B1, AP2B1, and
AP3B1 and appears to be missing most of the C-terminal hinge and/or ear
domain. By coimmunoprecipitation and yeast 2-hybrid analysis, the
authors confirmed that AP4B1 interacts with AP4E1 and AP4M1.

Abou Jamra et al. (2011) found ubiquitous AP4B1 expression in all fetal
and adult brain structures examined.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Consortium mapped the AP4B1 gene to
chromosome 1 (TMAP W87476).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By linkage analysis followed by candidate gene sequencing of a
consanguineous Israeli Arab family with autosomal recessive mental
retardation and spasticity (SPG47; 614066), Abou Jamra et al. (2011)
identified a homozygous truncating mutation in the AP4B1 gene
(607245.0001). The authors concluded that AP4-complex-mediated vesicular
trafficking plays a crucial role in brain development and function.

In 2 sibs, born of consanguineous Arab parents, with SPG47, Bauer et al.
(2012) identified a homozygous truncating mutation in the AP4B1 gene
(607245.0002). The mutation was found by exome sequencing of the
candidate region on chromosome 1p13-p12 identified by linkage analysis
(Blumkin et al., 2011). Bauer et al. (2012) noted the phenotypic
similarities to the patients reported by Abou Jamra et al. (2011).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 47, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
AP4B1, 3-BP INS, 487TAT

By linkage analysis followed by candidate gene sequencing of a
consanguineous Israeli Arab family with autosomal recessive mental
retardation and spasticity (SPG47; 614066), Abou Jamra et al. (2011)
identified a homozygous 3-bp insertion (487insTAT) in exon 5 of the
AP4B1 gene, resulting in premature protein termination. PCR analysis
showed decreased AP4B1 transcripts in patient cells compared to
controls, consistent with nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The mutation was
not found in 796 control chromosomes, including 160 Israeli Arab control
chromosomes.

In 2 sibs, born of consanguineous Arab parents, with autosomal recessive
complicated spastic paraplegia-47 (614066), Bauer et al. (2012)
identified a homozygous 1-bp deletion (664delC) in exon 5 of the AP4B1
gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination. Each
unaffected parent was heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found
in 316 Caucasian and 200 ethnically matched control chromosomes.

600087	TITLE *600087 TUFTELIN; TUFT1
DESCRIPTION Tuftelin is an acidic protein found in developing and mature
extracellular enamel, the unique and highly mineralized ectodermal
tissue covering vertebrate teeth (Deutsch, 1989; Deutsch et al., 1991).
It is thought to play a major role in mineralization and structural
organization of enamel.

Deutsch et al. (1992) cloned and sequenced 4 exons of the tuftelin gene
from a human genomic library. MacDougall et al. (1998) described the
cloning, characterization, and tissue expression pattern of mouse
tuftelin cDNA. Bashir et al. (1998) cloned the bovine tuftelin gene.
They commented that the protein does not appear to share homology or
domain motifs with any other known protein. They also isolated the
3-prime portion of the human gene and demonstrated agreement between the
bovine and human sequences in the segment studied. Differences between
the sequence they reported and that reported by Deutsch et al. (1991)
suggested the possibility of an unusual type of polymorphism that would
result in markedly different amino acid sequences at the C-terminal
region of the protein.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Deutsch et al. (1994) mapped the
TUFT1 gene to 1q21-q31. They raised the possibility that an autosomal
dominant form of amelogenesis imperfecta (104500, 104530) is due to a
mutation in this gene. By FISH, Bashir et al. (1998) localized the TUFT1
gene to 1q21.

612461	TITLE *612461 ACTIVITY-REGULATED CYTOSKELETON-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; ARC
;;KIAA0278
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1996) cloned ARC, which they designated
KIAA0278. The deduced 460-amino acid protein shares significant
similarity with rat Arc. Northern blot analysis detected low ARC
expression in heart, brain, lung, skeletal muscle, pancreas, prostate,
and testis, weak expression in small intestine, colon, and peripheral
blood leukocytes, and no expression in other tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Dynes and Steward (2007) stated that rat neurons express Arc at low
levels under resting conditions, but Arc mRNA is rapidly induced and
delivered into dendrites following synaptic activity. Using cultured
embryonic rat cortical neurons expressing a tagged Arc mRNA, they found
that Arc assembled into particles that moved independently,
bidirectionally, and intermittently with velocities consistent with both
actin-based and microtubule-based transport. Rapidly translocating Arc
mRNA particles sometimes reversed direction and decreased velocity just
before stopping, suggesting that local signals regulate Arc mRNA
targeting.

Greer et al. (2010) noted that ARC mediates endocytosis of neuronal
AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) (see GRIA1; 138248). Using
overexpression, knockdown, and mutation experiments with rodent neurons,
they found that Ube3a (601623) ubiquitinated Arc, resulting in Arc
degradation and increased surface expression of postsynaptic AMPARs,
with increased AMPAR-mediated currents.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1996) mapped the ARC gene
to chromosome 8. Using FISH, Kremerskothen and Barnekow (2000) mapped
the single-copy ARC gene to chromosome 8q24.

147670	TITLE *147670 INSULIN RECEPTOR; INSR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Insulin receptor is a tetramer of 2 alpha and 2 beta subunits. The alpha
and beta subunits are coded by a single gene and are joined by disulfide
bonds, a mechanism parallel to that of its ligand, insulin (INS; 176730)
(Rubin, 1984).

CLONING

Ullrich et al. (1985) deduced the entire 1,370-amino acid sequence of
the insulin receptor from a cDNA clone. The precursor starts with a
27-amino acid signal sequence, followed by the receptor alpha subunit, a
precursor processing enzyme cleavage site, then the beta subunit
containing a single 23-amino acid transmembrane sequence.

Caro et al. (1988) demonstrated differences in molecular mass,
carbohydrate composition, and antigenicity between the insulin receptor
alpha subunit in liver and in muscle and adipose tissue, the 2 major
peripheral target tissues of insulin. Moreover, the same authors showed
that the insulin-stimulated tyrosyl kinase activity is greater in muscle
than in liver or adipose tissue. There are sequence homologies to EGF
receptor (131550).

Two insulin receptor mRNA transcripts resulting from alternative
splicing of exon 11 in the receptor gene are expressed in a highly
regulated tissue-specific fashion. Benecke et al. (1992) studied the
relative abundance of these 2 mRNA species in human tissues; the one
containing exon 11 shows a marked predominance in liver, whereas the
isoform in which exon 11 has been spliced out shows a comparable
predominance in leukocytes. Similar amounts of the 2 variants were found
in placenta, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue. No significant
differences were found between control and diabetic subjects.

GENE FUNCTION

Due et al. (1986) presented evidence that the class I MHC heavy chain
(HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C; see 142800) is a structural subunit of the insulin
receptor. This broadens the range of biologic functions possible for
histocompatibility antigens. Interaction of class I HLA molecules with
glucagon receptors (e.g., 138033) and epidermal growth factor receptors
(e.g., 131550) has also been demonstrated. Due et al. (1986) favored the
hypothesis that the beta-2-microglobulin molecule (B2M; 109700) is
replaced by the insulin receptor when it associates with the MHC class I
heavy chain. Kittur et al. (1987) presented evidence for associations
between HLA antigens and specific insulin-binding sites on human B
lymphocytes. They cited experiments demonstrating coprecipitation of a
fraction of insulin receptors with class I and class II MHC antigens.
Thus, in addition to other functions of the MHC antigens, they may
affect the functioning of, or themselves serve as, cell surface
receptors.

Williams et al. (1990) created a mutant form of the INSR gene by
site-directed mutagenesis in order to study the effects of mutation on
functions of the receptor.

Christiansen et al. (1991) used data from electron microscopy to deduce
a model for a quaternary structure of the insulin receptor of human
placenta.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid system, Dey et al. (1998) identified a regulatory
subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, PIK3R3 (606076), as a binding
partner of INSR. They concluded that PIK3R3 interacts with IGF1R
(147370) and INSR in a kinase-dependent manner, providing an alternative
pathway for the activation of PI3K by these 2 receptors.

The protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B (176885) is responsible for
negatively regulating insulin signaling by dephosphorylating the
phosphotyrosine (ptyr) residues of the INSR kinase activation segment,
or IRK. By integrating crystallographic, kinetic, and PTP1B
peptide-binding studies, Salmeen et al. (2000) defined the molecular
specificity of this reaction. Extensive interactions are formed between
PTP1B and the IRK sequence encompassing the tandem ptyr residues at
positions 1162 and 1163, such that ptyr1162 is selected at the catalytic
site and ptyr1163 is located within an adjacent ptyr-recognition site.
This selectivity is attributed to the 70-fold greater affinity for
tandem ptyr-containing peptides relative to mono-ptyr peptides and
predicts a hierarchical dephosphorylation process. Many elements of the
PTP1B-IRK interaction are unique to PTP1B, indicating that it may be
feasible to generate specific, small molecule inhibitors of this
interaction to treat diabetes and obesity.

Leibiger et al. (2001) showed that insulin activates the transcription
of its own gene and that of the beta-cell glucokinase gene (GCK; 138079)
by different mechanisms. Whereas INS gene transcription is promoted by
signaling through INSR type A (without exon 11), PI3K class IA (see
171833), and the 70-kD S6 kinase, insulin stimulates the beta-cell GCK
gene by signaling via INSR type B (with exon 11), PI3K class II (see
602838)-like activity, and protein kinase B (164730). These data
provided evidence for selectivity in insulin action via the 2 INSR
isoforms, the molecular basis being preferential signaling through
different PI3K and protein kinases.

Rajala and Anderson (2001) sought to identify the
tyrosine-phosphorylated protein(s) in the bovine rod outer segments
(ROS) that are associated with PI3K. They concluded that tyrosine
phosphorylation of the beta subunit of the insulin receptor is involved
in the regulation of PI3K activity in the ROS.

By purification and molecular characterization, Brunetti et al. (2001)
found that HMGIY (600701) bound and activated 2 AT-rich regions in the
INSR promoter. Knockdown of HMGIY via antisense RNA reduced surface
expression of INSR in 2 human cell lines that normally express high INSR
levels. Conversely, transfection of HMGIY elevated surface expression of
INSR in 2 cell lines that normally express little INSR.

Decreased affinity of numerically normal insulin receptor binding sites
has been reported in patients with myotonic dystrophy (Tevaarwerk et
al., 1979). Myotonic dystrophy is often associated with disturbances in
insulin response. In muscle from patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1
(DM1; 160900), altered insulin receptor splicing to the nonmuscle
isoform corresponds to the insulin insensitivity and diabetes that are
part of the myotonic dystrophy phenotype; because of insulin-receptor
species differences, this effect is not seen in mouse models of DM.
Savkur et al. (2004) demonstrated that comparable splicing abnormalities
occur in DM2 (602668) muscle before the development of muscle
histopathology, thus demonstrating an early pathogenic effect of RNA
expansions.

Song et al. (2013) showed in mice that muscle-specific mitsugumin-53
(MG53; 613288) mediates the degradation of the insulin receptor and
insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1; 147545), and when upregulated causes
metabolic syndrome featuring insulin resistance, obesity, hypertension,
and dyslipidemia. Mg53 expression is markedly elevated in models of
insulin resistance, and Mg53 overexpression suffices to trigger muscle
insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome sequentially. Conversely,
ablation of Mg53 prevents diet-induced metabolic syndrome by preserving
the insulin receptor, Irs1, and insulin signaling integrity.
Mechanistically, Mg53 acts as an E3 ligase targeting the insulin
receptor and Irs1 for ubiquitin-dependent degradation, comprising a
central mechanism controlling insulin signal strength in skeletal
muscle. Song et al. (2013) concluded that these findings defined MG53 as
a novel therapeutic target for treating metabolic disorders and
associated cardiovascular complications.

GENE STRUCTURE

Seino et al. (1989) found that the INSR gene spans more than 120 kb and
has 22 exons. The 11 exons encoding the alpha subunit are dispersed over
more than 90 kb, whereas the 11 exons encoding the beta subunit are
located together in a region of about 30 kb. Three transcriptional
initiation sites were identified, located 276, 282, and 283 bp upstream
of the translation initiation site.

Brunetti et al. (2001) stated that the promoter region of INSR has no
TATA or CAAT boxes, but is extremely GC rich. In addition, they
identified 2 functional AT-rich sequences in the INSR promoter that were
bound and activated by HMGIY.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

McKern et al. (2006) presented the crystal structure at 3.8-angstrom
resolution of the IR-A ectodomain dimer of the insulin receptor,
complexed with 4 antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) from the monoclonal
antibodies 83-7 and 83-14, grown in the presence of a fragment of an
insulin (176730) mimetic peptide. The structure reveals the domain
arrangement in the disulfide-linked ectodomain dimer, showing that the
insulin receptor adopts a folded-over conformation that places the
ligand-binding regions in juxtaposition. This arrangement is different
from previous models. It shows that the 2 L1 domains are on opposite
sides of the dimer, too far apart to allow insulin to bind both L1
domains simultaneously as previously proposed. Instead, the structure
implicates the carboxy-terminal surface of the first fibronectin type
III domain as the second binding site involved in high-affinity binding.

Lou et al. (2006) reported the crystal structure of the first 3 domains
of INSR at 2.3-angstrom resolution and compared it with the structure of
the corresponding fragment of IGF1R. They observed notable differences
in the regions governing ligand specificity and binding.

Menting et al. (2013) presented a view of the interaction of insulin
with its primary binding site on the insulin receptor on the basis of 4
crystal structures of insulin bound to truncated insulin receptor
constructs. The direct interaction of insulin with the first
leucine-rich repeat domain (L1) of insulin receptor is sparse, the
hormone instead engaging the insulin receptor carboxy-terminal
alpha-chain (alpha-CT) segment, which is itself remodeled on the face of
L1 upon insulin binding. Contact between insulin and L1 is restricted to
insulin B-chain residues. The alpha-CT segment displaces the B-chain
C-terminal beta-strand away from the hormone core, revealing the
mechanism of a long-proposed conformational switch in insulin upon
receptor engagement. This mode of hormone-receptor recognition is novel
within the broader family of receptor tyrosine kinases.

MAPPING

With in situ hybridization and Southern blot analysis of somatic cell
hybrid DNA, Yang-Feng et al. (1985) assigned the insulin receptor gene
to 19p13.3-p13.2. This site is involved in a nonrandom translocation in
pre-B-cell acute leukemia. The t(1;19) was demonstrated by several
workers (e.g., Williams et al., 1984) in this childhood form of acute
lymphoblastic leukemia which responds poorly to treatment. The cells
produce cytoplasmic but not cell-surface immunoglobulin heavy chains.
Shaw et al. (1986) concluded from linkage studies that INSR is very
close to C3 (120700) but far from DM (160900). By fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Trask et al. (1993) assigned the INSR gene to 19p13.3. By
simultaneous mapping of multiple probes, they were able to achieve a
more refined assignment than was possible when a single probe or a few
probes were mapped.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Taylor et al. (1986) concluded that a patient with Donohue syndrome
(246200) and extreme insulin resistance was a genetic compound, i.e.,
that each parent had transmitted to the proband a different defect of
the insulin receptor (see 147670.0002). The patient, referred to as
leprechaun/Ark-1, had an 80 to 90% decrease in the number of insulin
receptors in circulating monocytes. Although the receptors on
Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphocytes from the patient were normal
in number, they showed decreased sensitivity to changes in temperature
and pH. The father, who had a moderate degree of insulin resistance,
resembled the patient in that his monocytes had a 60 to 80% decrease in
the number of insulin receptors. Binding of the father's EB
virus-transformed lymphocytes was normal. The mother had normal
sensitivity to insulin and a normal number of insulin receptors on
circulating monocytes. On the other hand, insulin receptors on the
mother's EB virus-transformed lymphocytes were qualitatively abnormal,
resembling closely the daughter's cultured cells. The father, who was
heterozygous for the nonsense mutation, showed a moderate degree of
insulin resistance. Ojamaa et al. (1988) found marked reduction in the
level of receptor mRNA in a patient with Donohue syndrome.

Kadowaki et al. (1988) raised the question of whether mutations in the
insulin receptor gene may account for the insulin resistance in some
patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM; 125853).
Taira et al. (1989) suggested that many instances of NIDDM may be due to
relatively minor mutations of the insulin receptor gene that cause
slightly decreased affinity of the receptor for insulin or a slightly
decreased kinase activity; in these cases, environmental factors such as
obesity may trigger the onset of diabetes.

Discussing the mechanisms of insulin resistance, Moller and Flier (1991)
and Taylor et al. (1991) diagrammed the structure of the human insulin
receptor and indicated the position of known point mutations. Taylor et
al. (1991) divided mutations in the INSR gene into 5 classes: class 1,
impaired receptor biosynthesis; class 2, impaired transport of receptors
to the cell surface; class 3, decreased affinity of insulin binding;
class 4, impaired tyrosine kinase activity; and class 5, accelerated
receptor degradation.

Among 22 unrelated women with insulin resistance, acanthosis nigricans,
and the polycystic ovary syndrome (hyperandrogenemia, oligoamenorrhea,
and hirsutism; 610549), Moller et al. (1994) identified only 1 mutation
in the INSR gene: arg1174 to gln (147670.0030). Moller et al. (1994)
concluded that mutation in the INSR gene is a rare cause of the type A
syndrome of extreme insulin resistance.

't Hart et al. (1999) studied random samples of subjects with NIDDM and
controls from the Hoorn and Rotterdam population-based studies to
determine the prevalence of variants in NIDDM candidate genes. The
val985-to-met (147670.0029) INSR variant was found at frequencies of 4.4
and 1.8%, respectively, in NIDDM and normoglycemic patients.

McCarthy et al. (2001) genotyped 24 single-nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) within the 19p13 region in a Caucasian population comprising 827
unrelated cases of typical migraine (607508). Five SNPs within the
insulin receptor gene showed significant association with migraine.
Functional studies of the INSR SNPs showed no effect on mRNA levels or
splicing in peripheral blood leukocytes or on binding of insulin to
mononuclear cells. The authors speculated on possible mechanisms by
which the INSR could play a role in the pathogenesis of migraine.

Longo et al. (2002) reported 6 patients and correlated mutations in the
insulin receptor gene with survival. Patients with Donohue syndrome were
homozygous or compound heterozygous for mutations in the extracellular
domain of the insulin receptor, and their cells had markedly impaired
insulin binding (less than 10% of controls). Mutations in their insulin
receptor gene inserted premature stop codons resulting in decreased
levels of mature mRNA, or alternatively affected the extracellular
domain of the receptor. Three patients with Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome
had at least 1 missense mutation in the intracellular domain of the
insulin receptor. Expression studies in CHO cells indicated that several
mutations markedly impaired insulin binding (less than 5% of control),
while others retained significant insulin-binding activity. The authors
concluded that mutations in the insulin receptor retaining residual
insulin-binding activity correlated with prolonged survival in a series
of patients with extreme insulin resistance.

In all affected members of a 3-generation Danish family with
hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (see HHF5, 609968), Hojlund et al. (2004)
identified heterozygosity for a point mutation in the insulin receptor
gene (147670.0037). The mutation was not found in any unaffected family
members. The proband's sister, who had moderate symptoms of
hypoglycemia, showed mild skin pigmentation in the axillae, increased
total and free serum levels of testosterone, and polycystic ovaries.

Foti et al. (2005) reported 4 patients with insulin resistance and type
II diabetes in whom cell-surface insulin receptors were decreased and
INSR gene transcription was impaired although the INSR genes were
normal. In these individuals, expression of HMGA1 (600701) was markedly
reduced; restoration of HMGA1 protein expression in their cells enhanced
INSR gene transcription and restored cell-surface insulin receptor
protein expression and insulin-binding capacity. Foti et al. (2005)
concluded that defects in HMGA1 may cause decreased insulin receptor
expression and induce insulin resistance.

ANIMAL MODEL

In genetically obese mice with insulin resistance, Le Marchand-Brustel
et al. (1985) found a defect in the tyrosine kinase activity of insulin
receptor.

Complete lack of insulin receptors due to mutations of the insulin
receptor gene results in severe growth retardation and mild diabetes. In
mice, targeted inactivation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (147545)
leads to inhibition of growth and mild resistance to the metabolic
actions of insulin. To address the question of whether both metabolic
and growth-promoting actions of insulin are mediated by the insulin
receptor, Accili et al. (1996) generated mice lacking insulin receptors
by targeted mutagenesis in embryo-derived stem (ES) cells. Unlike human
patients lacking insulin receptors, mice homozygous for a null allele of
the insulin receptor gene were born at term with apparently normal
intrauterine growth and development. Within hours of birth, however,
homozygous null mice developed severe hyperglycemia and hyperketonemia,
and died as a result of diabetic ketoacidosis within 48 to 72 hours. The
authors considered the data consistent with a model in which the insulin
receptor functions primarily to mediate the metabolic actions of
insulin.

To determine the contribution of muscle insulin resistance to the
metabolic phenotype of diabetes, Bruning et al. (1998) used the Cre-loxP
system to disrupt the mouse Insr gene in mouse skeletal muscle. The
muscle-specific Insr knockout mice exhibited a muscle-specific reduction
greater than 95% in receptor content and early signaling events. The
mice displayed elevated fat mass, serum triglycerides, and free fatty
acids, but blood glucose, serum insulin, and glucose tolerance were
normal. Thus, insulin resistance in muscle contributes to the altered
fat metabolism associated with type II diabetes, but tissues other than
muscle appear to be more involved in insulin-regulated glucose disposal
than previously recognized.

To determine whether insulin signaling has a functional role in the
pancreatic beta cell, Kulkarni et al. (1999) used the Cre-loxP system to
specifically inactivate the mouse Insr gene in the beta cells.
Expression of Cre using a pancreatic beta cell-specific rat insulin
promoter resulted in efficient recombination of a loxP-containing Insr
gene in the beta cells. Mice lacking the beta-cell insulin receptor
showed a loss of first-phase insulin secretion in response to glucose,
but not to arginine, similar to that observed in humans with type II
diabetes. These mice also showed a progressively impaired glucose
tolerance over 6 months. The data indicated an important functional role
for the insulin receptor in glucose sensing by the pancreatic beta cell
and suggested that defects in insulin signaling at the level of the beta
cell may contribute to the observed alterations in insulin secretion in
type II diabetes.

To investigate the effect of the loss of direct insulin action in liver,
Michael et al. (2000) used the Cre-loxP system to inactivate the Insr
gene in hepatocytes. Liver-specific Insr-knockout (LIRKO) mice exhibited
dramatic insulin resistance, severe glucose intolerance, and a failure
of insulin to suppress hepatic glucose production and to regulate
hepatic gene expression. These alterations were paralleled by marked
hyperinsulinemia due to a combination of increased insulin secretion and
decreased insulin clearance. With aging, the livers of knockout mice
exhibited morphologic and functional changes, and the metabolic
phenotype became less severe. Thus, the authors concluded that insulin
signaling in liver is critical in regulating glucose homeostasis and
maintaining normal hepatic function.

Bruning et al. (2000) created mice with a neuron-specific disruption of
the Insr gene (NIRKO). Inactivation of the insulin receptor had no
impact on brain development or neuronal survival. However, female NIRKO
mice showed increased food intake, and both male and female mice
developed diet-sensitive obesity with increases in body fat and plasma
leptin levels, mild insulin resistance, elevated plasma insulin levels,
and hypertriglyceridemia. NIRKO mice also exhibited impaired
spermatogenesis and ovarian follicle maturation because of hypothalamic
dysregulation of luteinizing hormone (see 152780). Thus, insulin
receptor signaling in the central nervous system plays an important role
in regulation of energy disposal, fuel metabolism, and reproduction.

Belke et al. (2002) generated mice with a cardiomyocyte-specific Insr-
knockout (CIRKO), using cre/loxP recombination. Hearts of CIRKO mice
were 20 to 30% smaller because of decreased postnatal hypertrophy of
cardiomyocytes; they had persistent expression of the fetal beta-myosin
heavy chain isoform, approximately half the normal expression of glucose
transporter-1 (GLUT1; 138140), and a 2-fold increase in GLUT4
expression. Cardiac glucose uptake was increased in vivo, glycolysis was
increased in isolated working hearts, and there was reduced expression
of enzymes that catalyze mitochondrial beta-oxidation, leading to
decreased fatty acid oxidation rates.

In brown adipose tissue-specific Insr-knockout mice, Guerra et al.
(2001) observed age-dependent profound brown fat atrophy concomitant
with the development of fasting hyperglycemia and impaired glucose
tolerance. Guerra et al. (2001) concluded that the insulin receptor
plays a direct role in brown fat adipogenesis and suggested that brown
adipose tissue is involved in the regulation of insulin secretion and
glucose homeostasis.

Using the Cre-loxP system, Bluher et al. (2002) generated fat-specific
Insr-knockout (FIRKO) mice which they found to have reduced fat mass and
loss of the normal relationship between plasma leptin and body weight.
The mice were also protected against age-related and hypothalamic
lesion-induced obesity and obesity-related glucose intolerance. Using
histologic and gene expression studies, Bluher et al. (2002) observed
that the conditional knockout mice exhibited polarization of adipocytes
into populations of large and small cells, which differed in protein
expression pattern. Bluher et al. (2002) concluded that insulin
signaling in adipocytes is critical for development of obesity and its
associated metabolic abnormalities.

Bluher et al. (2003) generated mice with FIRKO. Growth curves were
normal in male and female FIRKO mice from birth to 8 weeks of age.
Starting at 3 months of age, FIRKO mice maintained 15 to 25% lower body
weights and a 50 to 70% reduction in fat mass throughout life. FIRKO
mice were healthy, lacked any of the metabolic abnormalities associated
with lipodystrophy, and were protected against age-related deterioration
in glucose tolerance, which was observed in all control strains. FIRKO
mice maintained low body fat, despite normal food intake. Indeed,
because FIRKO mice were leaner, the food intake of FIRKO mice expressed
per gram of body weight actually exceeded that of controls by an average
of 55%. Both male and female FIRKO mice were found to have an increase
in mean life span of about 134 days (18%), with parallel increases in
median and maximum life spans. Thus, Bluher et al. (2003) concluded that
reduction of fat mass without caloric restriction can be associated with
increased longevity in mice, possibly through effects on insulin
signaling.

Song et al. (2003) found that in Drosophila, the insulin receptor
functions in axon guidance and is required for photoreceptor cell axons
to find their way from the retina to the brain during development of the
visual system. The Drosophila insulin receptor functions as a guidance
receptor for the adaptor protein Dock/Nck (see 600508). This function is
independent of Chico, the Drosophila insulin receptor substrate homolog.

Nef et al. (2003) demonstrated that the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase
family, comprising INSR, IGF1R (147370), and IRR (147671), is required
for the appearance of male gonads and thus for male sexual
differentiation. XY mice that were mutant for all 3 receptors developed
ovaries and showed a completely female phenotype. Reduced expression of
both Sry (480000) and the early testis-specific marker Sox9 (608160)
indicated that the insulin signaling pathway is required for male sex
determination.

Kondo et al. (2003) observed that, following relative hypoxia, mice with
a vascular endothelial cell-specific Insr knockout (VENIRKO) showed a
57% decrease in retinal neovascularization compared to controls, which
was associated with a blunted rise in the vascular mediators VEGF
(192240), eNOS (NOS3; 163729), and endothelin-1 (EDN1; 131240). Mice
with a vascular endothelial cell-specific knockout of the Igf1 receptor
(VENIFARKO) showed only a 34% reduction in neovascularization and a very
modest reduction in mediator generation. Kondo et al. (2003) concluded
that both insulin and IGF1 signaling in endothelium play a role in
retinal neovascularization through the expression of vascular mediators,
with insulin having a greater effect.

By mosaic analysis of insulin receptor function in mice, Kitamura et al.
(2004) demonstrated that insulin regulates growth independently of
metabolism and that the number of insulin receptors is an important
determinant of the specificity of insulin action. They generated mice
with variable cellular mosaicism for null Insr alleles. Insr ablation in
approximately 80% of cells caused extreme growth retardation,
lipoatrophy, and hypoglycemia, a clinical constellation that resembles
Donohue syndrome in humans (246200). Insr ablation in 98% of cells,
although resulting in similar growth retardation and lipoatrophy, caused
diabetes without beta-cell hyperplasia. The growth retardation was
associated with a greater than 60-fold increase in the expression of
hepatic insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 (IGFBP1; 146730).

In mice, genetic ablation of insulin receptors causes early postnatal
death from diabetic ketoacidosis (Accili et al., 1996). Okamoto et al.
(2004) showed that combined restoration of insulin receptor function in
brain, liver, and pancreatic beta cells rescued Insr knockout mice from
neonatal death, prevented diabetes in a majority of animals, and
normalized adipose tissue content, life span, and reproductive function.
In contrast, mice with insulin receptor expression limited to brain or
liver and pancreatic beta cells were rescued from neonatal death, but
developed lipoatrophic diabetes and died prematurely. Okamoto et al.
(2004) concluded that insulin receptor signaling in noncanonical insulin
target tissues is sufficient to maintain fuel homeostasis and prevent
diabetes.

Corl et al. (2005) found that specific inhibition of the insulin
receptor or its signaling pathways in the nervous system led to
increased ethanol sensitivity in Drosophila.

Ueki et al. (2006) created mice lacking both Insr and Igf1r only in
pancreatic beta cells. These mice were born with the normal complement
of islet cells, but 3 weeks after birth, they developed diabetes, in
contrast to mild phenotypes observed in single mutants. At 2 weeks of
age, normoglycemic beta cell-specific double-knockout mice showed
reduced beta cell mass, reduced expression of phosphorylated Akt
(164730) and the transcription factor MafA (610303), increased apoptosis
in islets, and severely compromised beta cell function. Analyses of
compound knockout showed a dominant role for insulin signaling in
regulating beta cell mass. Ueki et al. (2006) concluded that insulin-
and IGF1-dependent pathways are not critical for development of beta
cells but that a loss of action of these hormones in beta cells leads to
diabetes.

Biddinger et al. (2008) generated liver-specific Insr-knockout mice
(LIRKO) and observed a marked predisposition to cholesterol gallstone
formation, with all of the LIRKO mice developing gallstones after 12
weeks on a lithogenic diet. This predisposition was due to at least 2
distinct mechanisms: disinhibition of the Foxo1 gene (136533), which
increased expression of the biliary cholesterol transporters Abcg5
(605459) and Abcg8 (605460), resulting in an increase in biliary
cholesterol secretion; and decreased expression of the bile acid
synthetic enzymes, particularly Cyp7b1 (603711), which produced partial
resistance to the farnesoid X receptor (NR1H4; 603826), leading to a
lithogenic bile salt profile. Biddinger et al. (2008) concluded that
hepatic insulin resistance provides the link between the metabolic
syndrome (605552) and increased cholesterol gallstone susceptibility.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
DIABETES MELLITUS, INSULIN-RESISTANT, WITH ACANTHOSIS NIGRICANS
INSR, GLY996VAL

In a young Japanese male with insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus and
acanthosis nigricans (610549), in whom impaired tyrosine protein kinase
activity had been demonstrated, Odawara et al. (1989) cloned a cDNA for
the insulin receptor. One of this person's alleles had a mutation in
which valine was substituted for glycine-996, the third glycine in the
conserved gly-X-gly-X-X-gly motif in the putative binding site for
adenosine triphosphate. Expression of the mutant receptor by
transfection into Chinese hamster ovary cells confirmed that the
mutation impairs tyrosine kinase activity. The presence of mutant
receptors appeared to have negative effects on the activity of the
normal receptor. Studies with kinase-deficient insulin receptors
transfected into cultured cells show that such receptors function as
dominant-negative mutations and suppress the function of endogenous
insulin receptors (review by Kahn and Goldstein, 1989). In most other
cases of insulin resistance, the mutation is expressed as a recessive.
Yamamoto-Honda et al. (1990) studied the function of this mutant form of
the insulin receptor.

DONOHUE SYNDROME
INSR, LYS460GLU

Donohue syndrome (246200) is an autosomal recessive disorder due to a
defect in the INSR gene. In the patient leprechaun/Ark-1, Kadowaki et
al. (1988) found 2 different mutant alleles of the INSR gene. The
patient was a compound heterozygote, with the maternal allele containing
a missense mutation (AAG-to-GAG) encoding the substitution of glutamic
acid for lysine at position 460 in the alpha subunit and with the
paternal allele having a nonsense mutation causing premature chain
termination after amino acid 671 in the alpha subunit (147670.0002),
thereby deleting both the transmembrane and the tyrosine kinase domains
of the receptor. The mutation was designated leprechaunism
Ark-1/allele-1.

.0003
DONOHUE SYNDROME
INSR, GLU672TER

In a case of Donohue syndrome (246200) due to compound heterozygosity
for mutations in the INSR gene, Kadowaki et al. (1988) found that the
paternal allele had a nonsense mutation (CAG-to-TAG) causing premature
chain termination after amino acid 671 in the alpha subunit, thereby
deleting both the transmembrane and the tyrosine kinase domains of the
receptor. This mutation was designated leprechaunism Ark-1 allele-2. The
maternal allele carried a missense mutation (147670.0001).

.0004
DIABETES MELLITUS, INSULIN-RESISTANT, WITH ACANTHOSIS NIGRICANS
INSR, ARG735SER

Kakehi et al. (1988) found defective processing of the insulin receptor
precursor in a 23-year-old Japanese female with extreme insulin
resistance, acanthosis nigricans, bilateral polycystic ovaries, and
decreased erythrocyte insulin binding (610549). Antireceptor antibodies
showed the presence of increased amounts of a 210-kD protein but no
detectable alpha or beta subunits. It appeared that the 190-kD receptor
precursor was synthesized normally and underwent terminal glycosylation
and normal intracellular transport to the cell surface, but that
proteolytic maturation to alpha and beta subunits did not occur. The
mutation could lie either in the INSR gene or in the gene for the
receptor-processing enzyme. The former possibility proved to be correct.
Yoshimasa et al. (1988) found that the insulin receptor gene in this
patient had a point mutation within the tetrabasic processing site which
was changed from arg-lys-arg-arg to arg-lys-arg-ser. Exon 12 contained a
change in codon 735 from AGG-to-AGT. Epstein-Barr virus-transformed
lymphocytes from this patient synthesized an insulin receptor precursor
that was normally glycosylated and inserted into the plasma membrane but
was not cleaved to mature alpha and beta subunits. Insulin binding to
these cells was severely reduced but could be increased about 5-fold by
gentle treatment with trypsin, which was accompanied by appearance of
normal alpha subunits. These results indicated that proteolysis of the
proreceptor is necessary for its normal full insulin-binding sensitivity
and signal-transducing activity and that a cellular protease that is
more stringent in its specificity than trypsin is required to process
the receptor precursor. The patient was a 23-year-old Japanese woman who
was the product of a first-cousin marriage. Diabetes was first
recognized at age 6. She showed nonketotic insulin-resistant diabetes
mellitus with markedly elevated serum insulin values, acanthosis
nigricans, hirsutism, and virilism. Her older sister was similarly
affected. In addition, they showed some features not normally considered
part of this syndrome, including mental retardation, short stature, and
dental dysplasia. The latter 2 features have also been reported in an
unrelated subject with Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome (Rabson and
Mendenhall, 1956) who expressed an altered insulin receptor (Taylor et
al., 1983). Insulin resistance due to this mutation behaved as a
recessive.

.0005
DIABETES MELLITUS, INSULIN-RESISTANT, WITH ACANTHOSIS NIGRICANS
INSR, TRP?SER

Using a modification of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Moller and
Flier (1988) amplified and sequenced a 1,268-bp region that encodes the
intracellular beta subunit of the insulin receptor. Two single-base
changes in the INSR gene were detected, 1 of which encoded a
substitution of serine for tryptophan at a site within the tyrosine
kinase domain of the receptor. This was thought to be responsible for
the type A insulin resistance in the patient who showed acanthosis
nigricans and the polycystic ovary syndrome (610549). The patient had
previously been reported by Grigorescu et al. (1986), who found that
there was functional impairment of the beta subunit.

.0006
DIABETES MELLITUS, INSULIN-RESISTANT, WITH ACANTHOSIS NIGRICANS
INSR, EX17, ALU

Taira et al. (1989) studied a 17-year-old Japanese female who exhibited
insulin-resistant diabetes, short stature, and acanthosis nigricans
(610549). The mother had the same phenotype, whereas the father and 2
sibs were unaffected. The proband's maternal uncle and maternal
grandfather were also said to be diabetic and of short stature.
Erythrocytes and cultured fibroblasts from the proband and her mother
had an insulin-binding capacity in the normal range, but cultured
fibroblasts from both showed a below-normal rate of 2-deoxyglucose
uptake. Therefore, the insulin resistance in this instance seemed to be
due to a defect downstream from insulin binding. Taira et al. (1989)
demonstrated that the mutant insulin receptor gene in these 2 subjects
lacked almost the entire tyrosine kinase domain. Receptor
autophosphorylation and tyrosine kinase activity toward an exogenous
substrate were reduced in partially purified insulin receptors from the
proband's lymphocytes that had been transformed by Epstein-Barr virus.
With the use of several region-specific insulin receptor cDNA probes,
Taira et al. (1989) analyzed the mutation further and demonstrated that
it occurred at a nucleotide within the exon just before the codon for
lys1030. This amino acid is part of the adenosine triphosphate
(ATP)-binding site of the receptor and is required for tyrosine kinase
activity. The exon containing the mutation corresponded to exon 17,
which encodes the NH(2)-terminal part of the kinase domain. The sequence
of the receptor gene was normal on the upstream side of the site of the
mutation at nucleotide 145 (of the cloned fragment studied in detail);
distal to this site it was entirely different to the point where a stop
codon was reached at nucleotide 339. Thus, the putative product from the
mutated gene has a new sequence of 65 amino acids at its COOH-terminus.
The new sequence of the mutant allele was homologous to the consensus
sequence of the Alu family, suggesting that the mutation resulted from
recombination between exon 17 of the insulin receptor and an Alu
sequence.

.0007
DONOHUE SYNDROME
INSR, EX14, CODON 897

In a patient with Donohue syndrome (246200), Kadowaki et al. (1990)
identified a nonsense mutation at codon 897 in exon 14 in the paternal
allele of the patient's insulin receptor gene. In addition, they
obtained evidence that the patient's maternal allele contained a
cis-acting dominant mutation that, like the paternal allele, caused a
decrease in the level of mRNA. The nucleotide sequence of the entire
protein-coding domain and the sequences of the intron-exon boundaries of
all 22 exons of the maternal allele were normal. This mutation was
designated leprechaunism Minn-1.

INSULIN RESISTANCE, INCLUDED
INSR, ALA1134THR

Moller et al. (1990) studied a family in which 3 sisters had the type A
syndrome of insulin resistance (610549), the father was hyperinsulinemic
without acanthosis nigricans or other abnormalities (see 125853), and
the mother was normal. The daughters and father were found to be
heterozygous for a single base substitution in codon 1134 (GCA to ACA,
ala to thr). Transfection of the mutant insulin receptor gene into CHO
cells showed that the protein produced had markedly impaired
insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation. The family demonstrates that
severe insulin resistance with dominant inheritance can be caused by a
missense mutation and can be clinically silent in a male. Moller et al.
(1990) studied expression of the ala1134 mutant receptor in Chinese
hamster ovary cells. The expressed mutant receptors were processed
normally and displayed normal affinity in insulin binding but were
markedly deficient in insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation. Moller et
al. (1990) pointed out that alanine-1134 is a highly conserved residue
located in a consensus sequence found in most tyrosine kinases.

INSR, TRP1200SER

In patient A(2) of the study of Grigorescu et al. (1986) with
insulin-resistant diabetes and acanthosis nigricans (610549), Moller and
Flier (1988) detected a heterozygous point mutation affecting the
tyrosine kinase domain of the patient's insulin receptors, such that
tryptophan-1200 was replaced by serine. Hybridization of a mutant
allele-specific oligonucleotide to PCR-amplified cDNA confirmed the
presence of the mutant allele in the proband and excluded it in her
unaffected sister and mother, 18 normal control subjects, and 6 other
subjects with insulin resistance. Moller et al. (1990) showed that
Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with mutant cDNA produced a
mutant receptor that was functionally severely impaired. The studies
demonstrated the importance of trp-1200 to the normal function of the
insulin receptor kinase. The observations demonstrated that severe
insulin resistance can be caused by the heterozygous state of an INSR
mutation. (Moller et al. (1990) used the nucleotide and amino acid
numbering system of Ebina et al. (1985).)

In a patient with Donohue syndrome (246200), the son of parents related
as second cousins once removed, coming from the town of Geldeimalsen in
the Netherlands, Klinkhamer et al. (1989) described a leucine-to-proline
mutation at position 233 (L233P). By DNA amplification, they showed that
the patient was homozygous and the parents and 2 of the grandparents
from the consanguineous line were heterozygous. All the heterozygotes
showed decreased insulin binding to cultured fibroblasts and had mild
insulin resistance in vivo.

INSR, PHE382VAL

In 2 women with insulin-resistant diabetes (see 125853), daughters of
first-cousin, Venezuelan Caucasian parents, Accili et al. (1989)
identified a T-to-G transversion at position 1273, leading to the
substitution of valine for phenylalanine at position 382 in the alpha
subunit of the insulin receptor (F382V). Inspection of mutant insulin
receptor cDNA into NIH 3T3 cells demonstrated that the val382 mutation
impaired posttranslational processing and retarded transport of the
insulin receptor to the plasma membrane. They used multiple RFLPs to
determine haplotypes at the INSR locus and arrived at a lod score of
approximately 1.9 to 2.3 for linkage with insulin-resistant diabetes in
this family. They pointed out that this lod score exceeds the threshold
for declaring linkage when studying a single candidate locus (Lander and
Botstein, 1987). The sisters had previously been reported by Barnes et
al. (1974) as a case of insulin resistance possibly due to pineal gland
dysfunction.

.0012
RABSON-MENDENHALL SYNDROME
INSR, ASN15LYS

Kadowaki et al. (1990) studied a patient (RM-1) with Rabson-Mendenhall
syndrome (Moncada et al., 1986; 262190) who was found to be a compound
heterozygote for 2 mutant alleles of the INSR gene: a missense mutation
that substituted lysine for asparagine-15 (AAC to AAA) and a nonsense
mutation at codon 1000 (CGA to TGA; see 147670.0013). Kadowaki et al.
(1990) characterized the lys15-mutant receptor expressed by transfection
by mutant cDNA into NIH 3T3 cells. At least 2 defects in insulin
receptor function were observed. The mutation retarded posttranslational
processing of the receptor and impaired transport of the receptor to the
plasma membrane, thereby reducing the number of the receptors on the
cell surface. It also caused a 5-fold reduction in the affinity of the
receptor for insulin. Kadowaki et al. (1990) suggested that both
functional defects were related to distortion of the 3-dimensional
structure of the receptor by the mutation. Presumably, the abnormal
conformation interfered with the transport of the receptor through the
endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, and also inhibited the
binding of insulin to its binding site.

mutation resulting in substitution of histidine by arginine (H209R).
Kadowaki et al. (1991) demonstrated that this mutation impairs receptor
dimerization and transport of receptors to the cell surface. The small
number of receptors that are transported to the cell surface bind
insulin with normal affinity and have normal tyrosine kinase activity.

In a 16-year-old Japanese girl with type A insulin resistance
(hyperinsulinemia, decreased insulin binding, and acanthosis nigricans;
610549), Shimada et al. (1990) found that 1 LDLR allele, inherited from
her mother, contained a 1.2-kb deletion arising from a recombination
between 2 Alu elements, one in intron 13 and the other in intron 14, and
removing exon 14. The nature of the allele inherited from the father was
not determined. The father had borderline impairment of glucose
tolerance and mild insulin resistance. Shimada et al. (1992) extended
these studies to demonstrate that the deletion shifted the reading
frame, resulting in a termination codon after amino acid 867 (glu),
thereby producing a truncated insulin receptor without a transmembrane
region and cytoplasmic domain. They also sequenced all 22 exons of the
INSR gene and found no mutation in exons except for the deletion of exon
14. Thus the patient was heterozygous for a single mutant allele.

In a patient with acanthosis and insulin-resistant diabetes (610549)
described by Scarlett et al. (1982), Kusari et al. (1991) found compound
heterozygosity at the INSR locus. The parents were not consanguineous.
The paternal allele contained a missense mutation encoding the
substitution of glutamine for arginine at position 981 in the tyrosine
kinase domain of the receptor. The maternal allele contained a nonsense
mutation causing premature termination after amino acid 988 in the beta
subunit, thereby deleting most of the kinase domain. A CGA-to-CAA
mutation was responsible for the first change, and a CGA-to-TGA mutation
for the second.

DONOHUE SYNDROME
INSR, GLY31ARG

Maassen et al. (1988) described a patient named Helmond with Donohue
syndrome (246200) in whom intact fibroblasts showed markedly reduced
insulin binding but significant receptor autophosphorylation when the
glycoprotein fraction was used. In this patient, van der Vorm et al.
(1992) demonstrated a GGA-to-AGA change in exon 2 resulting in a
gly31-to-arg substitution. The proband was a compound heterozygote. The
mutation was present also in heterozygous state in the mother and
maternal grandfather. In the mother and grandfather, the mutation was
associated with decreased insulin binding to cultured fibroblasts and in
vivo hyperinsulinemia after an oral glucose tolerance test. In the
paternal line, all subjects had an insulin binding within the normal
range and the G31R mutation was absent.

.0021
DIABETES MELLITUS, NONINSULIN-DEPENDENT
INSR, ARG1152GLN

In a patient with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM;
125853), Cocozza et al. (1992) identified an abnormality in exon 20 of
the INSR gene by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE).
Sequencing showed a change of codon 1152 from CGG to CAG, resulting in
replacement of arginine with glutamine. The patient was heterozygous.
Although autophosphorylation of the purified insulin receptor seemed to
be normal and the insulin binding to intact erythrocytes from the
patient was in the normal range, the purified insulin receptor showed no
detectable activity toward an exogenous substrate.

.0022
DONOHUE SYNDROME
INSR, ARG372TER

In a black female, the second child of healthy unrelated parents of
Hispanic and Afro-American descent, Longo et al. (1992) found the
clinical features of Donohue syndrome (246200) related to compound
heterozygosity for different mutations. The paternally derived mutation,
a C-to-T transition at bp 1333, converted arginine-372 to a stop codon.
The maternally inherited allele had no mutations within the
protein-coding region, suggesting that the second mutation was located
in a region of the INSR gene involving control of gene expression. The
clinical features of the patient were reported by Norton et al. (1990).
The mutation was labeled leprechaunism Mount Sinai.

.0023
DONOHUE SYNDROME
INSR, VAL28ALA

Barbetti et al. (1992) used denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis
(DGGE) to identify compound heterozygosity for 2 different mutations in
the INSR gene in a patient labeled leprechaun/Verona-1. The patient was
a white female whose appearance suggested Donohue syndrome (246200) at
birth (characteristic facies, hirsutism, clitoromegaly). Immediately
after birth, she developed hypoglycemia during fasting. In addition, she
became hyperglycemic after meals. Her peak immunoreactive insulin during
an oral glucose tolerance test was very high. At age 6.5 years, pelvic
sonogram demonstrated polycystic ovaries, and abdominal sonogram showed
bilateral medullary sponge kidneys. The INSR allele inherited from the
father had a mutation substituting alanine for valine-28; in the allele
inherited from the mother, arginine was substituted for glycine-366.
Barbetti et al. (1992) applied the DGGE method also to several other
cases of Donohue syndrome in whom the genetic defect had previously been
identified.

DONOHUE SYNDROME
INSR, ARG86PRO

Fibroblasts cultured from a patient with Donohue syndrome (246200) with
intrauterine growth retardation and severe insulin resistance
(designated leprechaun Atlanta (Atl)-1) had normal amounts of insulin
receptor protein and defective insulin binding but constitutive
activation of insulin-receptor autophosphorylation and kinase activity
and of glucose transport (Longo et al., 1993). In the same fibroblasts,
growth was impaired. Homozygosity for a mutation in the INSR gene was
suspected, since he inherited identical DNA haplotypes for this gene
from the parents who were blood relatives. Longo et al. (1993) found
that indeed the proband was homozygous and both parents were
heterozygous for a G-to-C transversion at nucleotide 476 of the INSR
cDNA converting arginine-86 to proline. Expression of this mutation in
CHO cells duplicated the natural mutation by activating glucose
transport without increasing insulin binding or insulin-stimulated
cellular growth. The R86P substitution is contiguous to the hydrophobic
beta-sheet of the receptor alpha subunit implicated in the binding of
aromatic residues of the insulin molecule.

.0026
DIABETES MELLITUS, INSULIN-RESISTANT, WITH ACANTHOSIS NIGRICANS
INSR, ALA1135GLU

Cama et al. (1993) described the molecular findings in a 32-year-old
woman with insulin resistance. She had presented to medical attention at
the age of 11 with features of type A insulin resistance including
acanthosis nigricans and virilization (610549). Subsequently, her
acanthosis nigricans disappeared and she began to ovulate spontaneously,
became pregnant without medical intervention, and had an apparently
normal daughter. Using oligonucleotides complementary to sequences in
introns 18 and 19, Cama et al. (1993) used PCR to amplify exon 19 of the
insulin receptor gene. By direct sequencing of the amplified genomic
DNA, they demonstrated that codon 1135 was mutated from GCG (ala) to GAG
(glu). Neither parent had the mutation, which was heterozygous in the
proposita. Like previously described mutations in the tyrosine kinase
domain, the glu1135 mutation impaired receptor tyrosine kinase activity
and inhibited the ability of insulin to stimulate thymidine
incorporation and receptor endocytosis. However, unlike previously
described mutations in the intracellular domain of the receptor, the new
mutation impaired proteolytic cleavage of the proreceptor into separate
subunits and impaired the transport of the receptor to the cell surface.
The latter defect accounted for the decrease in number of receptors on
the cell surface of the patient's circulating monocytes.

.0027
DONOHUE SYNDROME
INSR, LYS121TER

In an offspring of consanguineous parents of Pakistani origin, Krook et
al. (1993) observed Donohue syndrome (246200) resulting from
homozygosity for a nonsense mutation, lys121-to-ter. Severe intrauterine
growth retardation had been evident throughout pregnancy and at birth
the baby had a wasted appearance with a distended abdomen, lack of
subcutaneous fat, and decreased muscle mass. The facies was gaunt with
pronounced hirsutism, protuberant ears, and gum hypertrophy. There was
generalized hypertrichosis. Both parents were heterozygous for a
mutation in codon 121 of the INSR gene that changed AAG (lysine) to TAG
(stop).

.0028
DONOHUE SYNDROME
INSR, DEL

In a 15-month-old boy with Donohue syndrome (246200), an offspring of
first-cousin parents, Wertheimer et al. (1993) found homozygous deletion
of the INSR gene. Thus, contrary to previous predictions, complete
absence of the INSR gene is compatible with life.

.0029
DIABETES MELLITUS, NONINSULIN-DEPENDENT
INSR, VAL985MET

In studies of 11 familial NIDDM pedigrees (125853), Elbein et al. (1993)
found 1 in which some members had a val985-to-met substitution in exon
17. The substitution was present in 3 NIDDM individuals in 3
generations, including a lean individual with onset at age 24. The
substitution was absent in 1 affected individual and was present in some
nondiabetic pedigree members. Nondiabetic carriers of the mutation were
found to have significantly higher glucose levels when compared with 266
members of other pedigrees, after correction for age, weight, and sex.
Elbein et al. (1993) suggested that although the val985-to-met
substitution does not result in severe insulin resistance and has low
penetrance with respect to expression of the NIDDM phenotype, it may
represent a modifying factor collaborating with other loci predisposing
to diabetes.

In a population-based Rotterdam study, 't Hart et al. (1996) examined
161 individuals with NIDDM and 538 healthy controls for the presence of
mutations in the INSR gene, using SSCP. A heterozygous mutation changing
valine-985 into methionine was detected in 5.6% of diabetic subjects and
in 1.3% of individuals with normal oral glucose tolerance test. Adjusted
for age, gender, and body-mass index, the findings indicated a relative
risk for diabetes of 4.49 for met985 carriers. When the total study
group was analyzed, 't Hart et al. (1996) found that the prevalence of
the mutation increased with increasing serum glucose levels.

In a study of random samples of subjects with NIDDM and controls from
the Hoorn and Rotterdam population-based studies, 't Hart et al. (1999)
found the val985-to-met INSR variant at frequencies of 4.4 and 1.8%,
respectively, in NIDDM and normoglycemic patients. Inclusion of data
from 2 other studies yielded a summarized odds ratio of 1.87. The
authors concluded that the association between the val985-to-met variant
in the INSR gene and type II diabetes, previously reported in the
Rotterdam study, is supported by the joint analysis with a second
population-based study and other studies.

.0030
DIABETES MELLITUS, INSULIN-RESISTANT, WITH ACANTHOSIS NIGRICANS
INSR, ARG1174GLN

Among 22 unrelated women with insulin resistance, acanthosis nigricans,
and the polycystic ovary syndrome (manifested by hyperandrogenemia,
oligoamenorrhea, and hirsutism; 610549), Moller et al. (1994) found
heterozygosity for a CGG-to-CAG transition in exon 20 of the INSR gene,
resulting in an arg1174-to-gln amino acid substitution. The mutation
involved the intracellular receptor beta subunit. The mutation was found
in an affected sister, whereas it was absent in the unaffected mother.
It was probably present in 2 paternal aunts who were reportedly
affected. Thus, arg1174 to gln, involving the insulin receptor tyrosine
kinase domain, is a cause of dominantly inherited insulin resistance.

.0031
INSULIN RESISTANCE
INSR, MET1153ILE

A met1153-to-ile mutation in the INSR gene was demonstrated to be the
cause of insulin resistance by Cama et al. (1991, 1992). The mutation
caused a defect in receptor internalization relative to normal
receptors. Insulin resistance in the patient showed a fluctuating
clinical course, suggesting that the ratio of normal receptors to mutant
receptors on the surface of the patient's cells may change depending on
factors that promote or inhibit receptor endocytosis, such as
hyperinsulinemia and obesity. Quon et al. (1994) applied to the study of
this mutation a physiologically relevant system for dissecting the
molecular mechanisms of insulin signal transduction related to glucose
transport. The method involved transfection of DNA into rat adipose
cells in primary culture. As a reporter gene, they used cDNA coding for
GLUT4 (138190) with an epitope tag in the first exofacial loop so that
GLUT4 translocation could be studied exclusively in transfected cells.
Insulin stimulated a 4.3-fold recruitment of transfected epitope-tagged
GLUT4 to the cell surface. Cells cotransfected with the reporter gene
and the human insulin receptor gene showed an increase in cell surface
GLUT4 in the basal state (no insulin) to levels comparable to those seen
with maximal insulin stimulation of cells transfected with the reporter
gene alone. In contrast, cells overexpressing the met1153-to-ile
mutation showed no increase in the basal cell surface GLUT4 and no shift
in the insulin dose-response curve relative to cells transfected with
the reporter gene alone. In contrast, cells overexpressing the
met1163-to-ile mutation showed no increase in the basal cell surface
GLUT4 and no shift in the insulin dose-response curve relative to cells
transfected with the reporter gene alone. The results were interpreted
as indicating that insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity is
essential in insulin-stimulated glucose transport in adipose cells.

.0032
DONOHUE SYNDROME
INSR, TRP412SER

In a child with Donohue syndrome (246200), the offspring of
consanguineous Turkish parents, van der Vorm et al. (1994) found a
trp412-to-ser mutation in the INSR gene. The mutant receptor was
expressed stably in CHO cells and transiently in COS-1 cells where it
was found that the mutant was not cleaved into alpha- and beta-subunits
but remained as a 210-kD proreceptor at an intracellular site.
Cross-linking experiments showed that the mutant proreceptor was able to
bind insulin with an affinity comparable to that of the wildtype alpha
chain. Despite its capacity to bind insulin, the mutant receptor was not
autophosphorylated. Impaired transport of the proreceptor to the cell
surface appeared to be the primary cause for the binding defect observed
in intact cells. The patient was thought to be homozygous for the
mutation.

.0033
DONOHUE SYNDROME
INSR, ILE119MET

Al-Gazali et al. (1993) described a 'mild' variant of Donohue syndrome
(246200) in 5 infants from an inbred family. Using denaturing gradient
gel electrophoresis and subsequent sequence of selected exons, Hone et
al. (1994) identified a homozygous mutation resulting from an
ile119-to-met substitution in exon 2 of the INSR gene in this family.
Mutation in the insulin binding domain predicts ineffective insulin
signal transduction.

.0034
RABSON-MENDENHALL SYNDROME
INSR, IVS4AS, A-G, -2

In an English patient with Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome (262190),
Takahashi et al. (1998) found compound heterozygosity for novel
mutations in the INSR gene. One was an A-to-G transition at the 3-prime
splice acceptor site of intron 4, and the other was an 8-bp deletion in
exon 12. Both decreased mRNA expression in a cis-dominant manner, and
were predicted to produce severely truncated proteins. Unexpectedly,
nearly normal insulin receptor levels were expressed in the patient's
lymphocytes, although the level of expression assessed by immunoblot was
approximately 10% of the control cells. Insulin-binding affinity was
markedly reduced, but insulin-dependent tyrosine kinase activity was
present. On analysis of INSR mRNA of lymphocytes by RT-PCR, aberrant
splicing caused by activation of a cryptic splice site in exon 5,
resulting in a 4-amino acid deletion and 1-amino acid substitution, but
restoring an open reading frame, was found. Skipped exon 5, another
aberrant splicing, was found in both the patient and the mother who was
heterozygous for the mutation, whereas activation of the cryptic splice
site occurred almost exclusively in the patient. Takahashi et al. (1998)
speculated that the mutant receptor may have been involved in the
relatively long survival of the patient by rescuing an otherwise more
severe phenotype resulting from the complete lack of functional insulin
receptors. The patient, previously reported by Quin et al. (1991), had
severe insulin-resistant diabetes and intermittent ketonuria, and was
treated successfully with recombinant insulinlike growth factor 1 (IGF1;
147440). Although other therapeutic agents were unsuccessful, the
patient lived to age 13, when he began subcutaneous IGF1 injections.

DONOHUE SYNDROME
INSR, ASN431ASP

In a Scottish Caucasian male with Donohue syndrome (246200) who died at
3 months of age, Maassen et al. (2003) detected a novel homozygous
A-to-G transition in the INSR gene that resulted in an asn431-to-asp
(N431D) amino acid change. The N431D mutation only partially reduced
insulin proreceptor processing and activation of signaling cascades. The
correlation between fibroblast insulin binding and duration of patient
survival reported by Longo et al. (2002) was not observed.

.0037
HYPERINSULINEMIC HYPOGLYCEMIA, FAMILIAL, 5
INSR, ARG1174GLN

In all affected members of a 3-generation Danish family with
hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (609968), Hojlund et al. (2004) identified
heterozygosity for a G-A transition at codon 1174 in exon 20 of the INSR
gene, resulting in an arg1174-to-gln (R1174Q) substitution. The mutation
was not found in any unaffected family members.

603658	TITLE *603658 RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN S7; RPS7
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The eukaryotic ribosome consists of more than 80 different ribosomal
proteins, including RPS7, and 4 RNA species (see 180450).

CLONING

Annilo et al. (1995) isolated cDNAs encoding RPS7 by screening a human
cDNA expression library with antibodies against rat Rps7. The deduced
194-amino acid human RPS7 protein is identical to rat Rps7. Northern
blot analysis detected an approximately 0.7-kb RPS7 transcript in HeLa
cells. The authors identified several RPS7 pseudogenes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Annilo et al. (1995) determined that the RPS7 gene contains 7 exons and
spans over 6 kb.

MAPPING

By FISH, Annilo et al. (1995) mapped the RPS7 gene to chromosome 2p25.
Kenmochi et al. (1998) confirmed the mapping assignment reported by
Annilo et al. (1995).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Gazda et al. (2008) screened 196 probands with Diamond-Blackfan anemia
(see DBA8, 612563) for mutations in 25 genes encoding ribosomal proteins
and identified a splice site mutation in the RPS7 gene in 1 proband
(603658.0001). The mutation was not found in his unaffected sister or at
least 150 controls, and functional studies strongly suggested that
mutation in RPS7 is associated with defects in the maturation of
ribosomal RNAs.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
DIAMOND-BLACKFAN ANEMIA 8
RPS7, IVS3DS, G-A, +1

In a male patient with Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA8; 612563) who had no
associated malformations, Gazda et al. (2008) identified heterozygosity
for a G-A transition at the donor splice site in intron 3 (IVS3DS+1G-A)
of the RPS7 gene. The mutation was not found in his unaffected sister or
in at least 150 controls. Lymphoblastoid cells established from the
patient's cells displayed higher levels of 45S and 30S pre-rRNAs
compared to cells derived from an unaffected sibling; siRNA knockdown of
RPS7 synthesis in HeLa cells resulted in a strong defect in 5-prime ETS
processing, with accumulation of 45S and 30S pre-rRNAs and a marked
decrease in the 41S, 21S, and 18S-E intermediates, whereas levels of
precursors to the large ribosomal subunit RNAs were unchanged.

602063	TITLE *602063 TRANSALDOLASE 1; TALDO1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Transaldolase (EC 2.2.1.2) is the key enzyme of the pentose phosphate
pathway, which is responsible for generation of reducing equivalents to
protect cellular integrity from reactive oxygen intermediates (Banki et
al., 1997).

CLONING

Banki et al. (1994) cloned the TALDO1 gene. The deduced 336-amino acid
protein has a predicted molecular mass of 38 kD and shows 58% overall
sequence homology with the 37-kD yeast transaldolase.

Kusuda et al. (1998) isolated the cDNA for the mouse homolog of TALDO1
and determined the nucleotide sequence covering the complete coding
region.

GENE STRUCTURE

Banki et al. (1994) determined that, unlike the intronless yeast
transaldolase gene, the human TALDO1 gene contains 5 exons, the second
and third of which are developed by insertion of a retrotransposable
element. Detection of a retrotransposon in the coding sequence of the
human transaldolase gene demonstrated the importance of these repetitive
elements in the evolution of the eukaryotic genome.

MAPPING

By Southern blot analysis of human/mouse somatic cell hybrid DNA, Banki
et al. (1997) mapped TALDO1 to the region 11pter-p13. By fluorescence in
situ hybridization (FISH), they narrowed the assignment to
11p15.5-p15.4. A truncated and mutated segment of exon 5 terminating
with a poly(A) tail was identified in a pseudogene locus (TALDOP1) on
chromosome 1. RT-PCR studies of mouse/human somatic cell hybrids
revealed the presence of the functional gene on chromosome 11 and its
absence on chromosome 1. Mapping of radiation hybrids placed TALDO1
between the markers WI-1421 and D11S922 on 11p15.

By FISH, Kusuda et al. (1997) concluded that the functional TALDO1 gene
is located on 1p34.1-p33. Kusuda et al. (1998) mapped a paralogous gene
to 11p15, where Banki et al. (1997) had mapped the TALDO1 gene. Kusuda
et al. (1998) symbolized the gene on chromosome 11 as TALDOR (TALDO
related). The exon sequence of TALDOR was almost identical to that of
TALDO but its exons corresponding to exons 4 and 5 of TALDO were found
to be split by 4 introns.

By FISH using cDNA as a probe, Kusuda et al. (1998) showed that the
mouse transaldolase gene is localized to bands F3-F4 of chromosome 7 as
a single-copy gene. This chromosomal region is known to be syntenic to
human chromosome 11p15 rather than to 1p34.1-p33, suggesting that TALDOR
is the ancestral form. The existence of TALDOR implied a duplication of
the mammalian transaldolase gene after divergence of rodent and primate.
Hashimoto (1998) concluded that the functional TALDO gene is on human
chromosome 11 and a pseudogene on human chromosome 1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Verhoeven et al. (2001) described a patient with transaldolase
deficiency (606003) caused by a homozygous 3-bp deletion (602063.0001)
in the TALDO1 gene, resulting in the absence of serine at position 171
of the transaldolase protein. This amino acid is invariable between
species and is located in a conserved region, indicating its importance
for enzyme activity.

ANIMAL MODEL

Perl et al. (2006) found that Taldo1-null mice developed normally, but
males were sterile due to functional and structural defects of
mitochondria. Reduced motility in Taldo1-null spermatozoa was associated
with diminished mitochondrial reactive oxygen intermediate production,
reduced calcium levels, intracellular acidosis, and compensatory
downregulation of carbonic anhydrase IV (CA4; 114760) and overexpression
of Cd38 (107270) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT1; 612346).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
TRANSALDOLASE DEFICIENCY
TALDO1, SER171DEL

In the first child of healthy, consanguineous Turkish parents, Verhoeven
et al. (2001) demonstrated transaldolase deficiency (606003) caused by a
homozygous 3-bp deletion in the TALDO1 gene that resulted in the loss of
ser171 in the transaldolase protein. Soon after birth, the patient had
undergone surgical correction of aortic coarctation. Within several
months, she developed hepatosplenomegaly. Elevated levels of several
pentoses were found in urine, plasma, and cerebrospinal fluid samples.
At the age of 10, the patient showed many telangiectases of the skin,
hepatosplenomegaly, and enlarged clitoris. She had persistent
thrombocytopenia which was thought to be caused by splenic pooling due
to the hepatosplenomegaly.

607860	TITLE *607860 YY1 ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1; YY1AP1
;;YY1-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; YAP;;
HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 2; HCCA2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By differential display PCR of normal hepatic tissue and hepatocellular
carcinomas, followed by screening a placenta cDNA library, Wang et al.
(2001) cloned YY1AP1, which they called HCCA2. The deduced 467-amino
acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 50.65 kD. HCCA2 contains
2 SH3-binding domains, 2 N-glycosylation sites, 6 N-myristoylation
sites, and numerous phosphorylation sites, but it does not have a
transmembrane domain, signal peptide, or targeting sequences. Northern
blot analysis detected 1.8- and 2.5-kb transcripts in all adult tissues
examined except liver. Expression was also detected in fetal liver,
lung, brain, and spleen. Western blot analysis of transfected embryonic
kidney fibroblasts detected HCCA2 at an apparent molecular mass of about
50 kD. Immunohistochemical staining showed that HCCA2 protein was
localized in the cytoplasm of liver cancer tissues, and it was not found
in surrounding nontumor hepatocytes.

Kuryshev et al. (2006) determined that YY1AP1 was formed by fusion of
the 5-prime region of the ASH1L gene (607999) and the 3-prime region of
the GON4L gene (610393) during a tandem segmental duplication on
chromosome 1. YY1AP1 contains the partial promoter and untranslated
first exon of ASH1L and coding exons 13 to 21 of GON4L. The 3-prime
region of YY1AP1 originated from a long terminal repeat of an endogenous
retrovirus, known as the MER51A repeat, that was inserted into exon 21
of GON4L after the duplication. The deduced YY1AP1 protein contains 750
amino acids, 748 of which correspond to amino acids 590 to 1,337 of the
GON4L protein. The last 2 C-terminal residues of YY1AP1 come from the
long terminal repeat of MER51A. RT-PCR detected ubiquitous expression of
YY1AP1, with highest levels in testis and skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Wang et al. (2001) determined that HCCA2 was not expressed in normal
adult liver tissue, but it was expressed in 79% of hepatocellular
carcinomas tested. HCCA2 expression was associated with invasion of the
tumor capsule.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Kuryshev et al. (2006) mapped the YY1AP1
gene to chromosome 1q22.

610458	TITLE *610458 LEUCINE ZIPPER AND CTNNBIP1 DOMAINS-CONTAINING PROTEIN; LZIC
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database searching for sequences similar to ICAT (CTNNBIP1; 607758),
followed by PCR of a mixed RNA pool from several gastric cancers, Katoh
(2001) cloned LZIC. The deduced 190-amino acid protein contains a
leucine zipper domain and an ICAT-like domain, the latter sharing 38%
amino acid identity with the ICAT gene. Northern blot analysis detected
a major 5.2-kb transcript and minor transcripts of 2.1, 1.6, and 1.0 kb
in almost all fetal and adult tissues examined with highest expression
in adult kidney. Using Northern blot and PCR analysis, Katoh (2001)
demonstrated LZIC expression in all cancer cell lines tested and showed
upregulated expression in a gastric cancer cell line and in 5 of 10
primary gastric cancers tested.

GENE STRUCTURE

Katoh (2001) determined that the LZIC gene contains at least 8 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Katoh (2001) mapped the LZIC gene to
chromosome 1pter-p36.32.

120436	TITLE *120436 MutL, E. COLI, HOMOLOG OF, 1; MLH1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MLH is homologous to the E. coli MutL gene and is involved in DNA
mismatch repair. Heterozygous mutations in the MLH1 gene result in
hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer-2 (HNPCC2; 609310)
(Papadopoulos et al., 1994).

CLONING

After human homologs of the mutS gene of bacteria and yeast were found
to have mutations responsible for hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal
cancer (HNPCC1; 120435), Papadopoulos et al. (1994) searched for other
human mismatch repair (MMR) genes. A survey of EST databases derived
from random cDNA clones revealed 3 additional human MMR genes, all
related to the bacterial mutL gene. One of these genes was MLH1. The
other 2 genes had a slightly greater similarity to the yeast mutL
homolog PMS1 and were therefore denoted PMS1 (600258) and PMS2 (600259),
respectively.

Genuardi et al. (1998) characterized the normal alternative splicing of
the MLH1 gene and reported a number of splice variants that exist in
various tissue types. They observed splice variants lacking exons 6/9,
9, 9/10, 9/10/11, 10/11, 12, 16, and 17. The level of expression varied
among different samples. All isoforms were found in 43 to 100% of the
mononuclear blood cell samples, as well as in other tissues. The authors
cautioned that knowledge of existence of multiple alternative splicing
events not caused by genomic DNA changes is important for the evaluation
of the results of molecular diagnostic tests based on RNA analysis.

GENE FUNCTION

Hypermutable H6 colorectal tumor cells are defective in strand-specific
mismatch repair and bear defects in both alleles of the human MLH1 gene.
Li and Modrich (1995) purified to near homogeneity an activity from HeLa
cells that complemented H6 nuclear extracts to restore repair
proficiency on a set of heteroduplex DNAs representing the 8 base-base
mismatches as well as a number of slipped-strand, insertion/deletion
mispairs. The activity behaved as a single species during fractionation
and copurified with proteins of 85 and 100 kD. Microsequence analysis
demonstrated both of these proteins to be homologs of bacterial MutL,
with the former corresponding to the human MLH1 product and the latter
to the product of human PMS2 or a closely related gene. The 1:1 molar
stoichiometry of the 2 polypeptides and their hydrodynamic behavior
indicated formation of a heterodimer. These observations indicated that
interactions between members of the family of the human MutL homologs
may be restricted.

Wang et al. (2000) used immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry
analyses to identify BRCA1 (113705)-associated proteins. They found that
BRCA1 is part of a large multisubunit protein complex of tumor
suppressors, DNA damage sensors, and signal transducers. They named this
complex BASC, for 'BRCA1-associated genome surveillance complex.' Among
the DNA repair proteins identified in the complex were ATM (607585), BLM
(604610), MSH2 (609309), MSH6 (600678), MLH1, the RAD50 (604040)-MRE11
(600814)-NBS1 (602667) complex, and the RFC1 (102579)-RFC2 (600404)-RFC4
(102577) complex. Wang et al. (2000) suggested that BASC may serve as a
sensor of abnormal DNA structures and/or as a regulator of the
postreplication repair process.

Meiotic recombination between homologous chromosomes generates crossover
and noncrossover products, which are derived from the formation of
double-strand breaks (DSBs) and result from distinct DSB repair
pathways. Guillon et al. (2005) analyzed crossovers and noncrossovers in
oogenesis and spermatogenesis in mice and determined that both crossover
and noncrossover pathways were Spo11 (605114) dependent. Mlh1 was
required for the formation of most crossovers, but not noncrossovers.
The remaining 5 to 10% of crossover products did not require Mlh1.
Guillon et al. (2005) concluded that the major crossover pathway
requires MLH1 for crossover formation and for mismatch repair of
heteroduplex DNA.

MutL-alpha is a heterodimer of MLH1 and PMS2 that is required for
mismatch repair. Kadyrov et al. (2006) identified human MutL-alpha as a
latent endonuclease activated in a DNA mismatch-, MutS-alpha (see
609309)-, RFC-, PCNA (176740)-, and ATP-dependent manner. Incision of a
nicked heteroduplex by this 4-protein system was strongly biased to the
nicked strand. A mismatch-containing DNA segment spanned by 2 strand
breaks was then removed by the 5-prime-to-3-prime activity of
MutS-alpha-activated exonuclease-1 (EXO1; 606063). By mutation analysis,
Kadyrov et al. (2006) mapped the endonuclease active site to a conserved
motif in PMS2.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Ban and Yang (1998) determined the crystal structure of a 40-kD
N-terminal fragment of E. coli MutL that retains all of the conserved
residues in the MutL family. The structure of MutL is homologous to that
of an ATPase-containing fragment of DNA gyrase. The authors demonstrated
that MutL binds and hydrolyzes ATP to ADP and Pi. Mutations in the MutL
family that cause deficiencies in DNA mismatch repair and a
predisposition to cancer mainly occur in the putative ATP-binding site.
Ban and Yang (1998) also provided evidence that the flexible, yet
conserved loops surrounding this ATP-binding site undergo conformational
changes upon ATP hydrolysis, thereby modulating interactions between
MutL and other components of the repair machinery.

Ellison et al. (2001) performed quantitative in vivo DNA mismatch repair
(MMR) assays in the yeast S. cerevisiae to determine the functional
significance of amino acid replacements in MLH1 and MSH2 genes observed
in the human population. Missense codons previously observed in human
genes were introduced at the homologous residue in the yeast MLH1 or
MSH2 genes. Three classes of missense codons were found: (i) complete
loss of function, i.e., mutations; (ii) variants indistinguishable from
wildtype protein, i.e., silent polymorphisms; and (iii) functional
variants which supported MMR at reduced efficiency, i.e., efficiency
polymorphisms. There was a good correlation between the functional
results in yeast and available human clinical data regarding penetrance
of the missense codon. The authors suggested that differences in the
efficiency of DNA MMR may exist between individuals in the human
population due to common polymorphisms.

Using bioinformatic analysis, Kosinski et al. (2010) determined that the
dimerization of MLH1 and PMS2 occurs via their C-terminal domains and
involves residues 531 to 549 and 740 to 756 in MLH1 and residues 679 to
699 and 847 to 862 in PMS2.

GENE STRUCTURE

Han et al. (1995) reported that the human MLH1 gene consists of 19
coding exons spanning approximately 100 kb. Exons 1 to 7 contain a
region that is highly conserved in the MLH1 and PMS1 genes of yeast.

MAPPING

Papadopoulos et al. (1994) mapped the MLH1 gene to chromosome 3p21.3 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. Bronner et al. (1994) mapped the
MLH1 gene to the same region, 3p23-p21.3, by fluorescence in situ
hybridization.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The mapping of MLH1 to 3p21 was of interest because markers in that area
had been linked to hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer in several
families (Lindblom et al., 1993). Searching for mutations in the MLH1
gene, Papadopoulos et al. (1994) performed RT-PCR analyses of
lymphoblastoid cell RNA and directly sequenced the coding region of the
gene in 10 HNPCC kindreds linked to 3p markers. All affected individuals
from 7 Finnish kindreds exhibited a heterozygous deletion of codons 578
to 632. The derivation of 5 of these 7 kindreds could be traced to a
common ancestor, and the presence of the same presumptive defect in 2
other kindreds supported a 'founder effect' for many cases of HNPCC in
the Finnish population. Codons 578 to 632 were found to constitute a
single exon that was deleted from 1 allele in the 7 kindreds. This exon
encodes several highly conserved amino acids found at identical
positions in yeast MLH1. In another 3p-linked family, Papadopoulos et
al. (1994) observed a 4-nucleotide deletion beginning at the first
position of codon 727 and producing a frameshift with a new stop codon
located 166 nucleotides downstream. As a result, the C-terminal 19 amino
acids of MLH1 were substituted with 53 different amino acids, some
encoded by nucleotides normally in the 3-prime untranslated region.
Another kindred displayed a 4-nucleotide insertion between codons 755
and 756. This insertion resulted in a frameshift and extension of the
open reading frame to include 99 nucleotides downstream of the normal
stop codon. One cell line showed a transversion from TCA to TAA in codon
252, resulting in conversion of a serine to a stop (120436.0001).

Simultaneously and independently, Bronner et al. (1994) likewise
implicated the human MutL homolog, MLH1, in the form of HNPCC that maps
to 3p. In 1 chromosome 3-linked HNPCC family, they demonstrated a
missense mutation in affected individuals (120436.0002).

Using PCR-SSCP analysis and DNA sequencing to examine the entire coding
region of the MLH1 gene in DNAs of 34 unrelated cancer patients from
HNPCC pedigrees, Han et al. (1995) found germline mutations in 8 (24%):
4 missense mutations, 1 intron mutation that would affect splicing, and
3 frameshift mutations resulting in truncation of the gene product
downstream of the mutation site.

Maliaka et al. (1996) identified 6 different novel mutations in the MLH1
and MSH2 genes in Russian and Moldavian HNPCC families. Three of these
mutations occurred in CpG dinucleotides and led to a premature stop
codon, splicing defect, or an amino acid substitution in evolutionarily
conserved residues. Analysis of a compilation of published mutations
including the new data suggested to the authors that CpG dinucleotides
within the coding regions of the MSH2 and MLH1 genes are hotspots for
single basepair substitutions.

From a study of unrelated HNPCC families, Wijnen et al. (1996) commented
that, whereas the spectrum of mutations at the MSH2 gene is
heterogeneous, a cluster of MLH1 mutations were found in the region
encompassing exons 15 and 16, which accounts for 50% of all the
independent MLH1 mutations described to date. They stated that their
finding has great practical value in the design of clinical genetic
services.

By screening members of Finnish families displaying HNPCC for
predisposing germline mutations in MSH2 and MLH1, Nystrom-Lahti et al.
(1995) showed that 2 mutations in MLH1 together account for 63% (19/30)
of kindreds meeting international diagnostic criteria. One mutation,
originally detected as a 165-bp deletion in MLH1 cDNA comprising exon
16, was shown to represent a 3.5-kb genomic deletion most likely
resulting from Alu-mediated recombination (120436.0004). The second
mutation destroyed the splice acceptor site of exon 6 (120436.0005).
They commented that this was the first report of Alu-mediated
recombination causing a prevalent, dominantly inherited predisposition
to cancer. Nystrom-Lahti et al. (1995) designed a simple diagnostic test
based on PCR for both mutations. Thus 2 ancestral founding mutations
account for most Finnish HNPCC kindreds.

Sasaki et al. (1996) studied 43 tumors and corresponding normal tissues
from 23 Japanese patients with multiple primary cancers. They found no
germline mutations of the MLH1 gene and detected only 2 somatic missense
mutations among the 43 tumors examined. These 2 tumors had each shown
increased replication error (RER+) at more than 1 of the 5
microsatellite loci examined. Only the second of these 2 mutations
occurred in an evolutionarily conserved domain of the protein.

Jager et al. (1997) reported studies based on the Danish HNPCC register
comprising 28 families that fulfilled the Amsterdam criteria. They found
an intron 14 founder mutation in the MLH1 gene (120436.0007) in
approximately 25% of the kindreds and showed that it was associated with
an attenuated HNPCC phenotype characterized by a highly reduced
frequency of extracolonic tumors. The mutation was a combined 7-bp
deletion and 4-bp insertion that 'silenced the mutated allele,' i.e., it
was not expressed. Tumors exhibited microsatellite instability (MSI),
and loss of the wildtype MLH1 allele was prevalent. Jager et al. (1997)
proposed that the mutation resulted in a milder phenotype because the
mutated MLH1 protein was prevented from exerting a dominant-negative
effect on the concerted action of the mismatch repair system.

Huang et al. (2001) studied a family with HNPCC in which the proband was
diagnosed with colorectal cancer at the age of 14 years; her mother,
grandmother, and aunt had been diagnosed with HNPCC in their twenties.
DNA sequencing revealed that the proband was heterozygous for the R226X
mutation (120436.0011).

Shimodaira et al. (1998) described a new method for detecting mutations
in MLH1 HNPCC using a dominant mutator effect of MLH1 cDNA expressed in
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Most MLH1 missense mutations identified in
HNPCC patients abolish the dominant mutator effect. Furthermore, PCR
amplification of MLH1 cDNA from mRNA of an HNPCC patient, followed by in
vivo recombination into a gap expression vector, allowed detection of a
heterozygous loss-of-function missense mutation in MLH1 using this
method. This functional assay offers a simple method for detecting and
evaluating pathogenic mutations in MLH1.

Liu et al. (1999) described 2 missense mutations in exon 16 of the MLH1
gene associated with colorectal cancer (see 120436.0012 and
120436.0013). The tumors did not show MSI, raising some potentially
important issues. First, even microsatellite-negative colorectal tumors
can be associated with germline mutations, and these will be missed if
an MSI test is used to select patients for mutation screening. Second,
the lack of MSI in these cases suggested that the mechanism involved in
the carcinogenesis could be different from that generally hypothesized.

In colorectal cancer arising in young Hong Kong Chinese, a high
incidence of microsatellite instability and germline mismatch repair
gene mutation has been found. Most of the germline mutations involve the
MSH2 gene, which is different from the mutation spectrum in the Western
population. In the MLH1 gene, alternative splicing is common, which
complicates RNA-based mutation detection methods. In contrast, large
deletions in MLH1, commonly observed in some ethnic groups, tend to
escape detection by exon-by-exon direct DNA sequencing. Chan et al.
(2001) reported the detection of a novel germline 1.8-kb deletion
involving exon 11 of the MLH1 gene in a Hong Kong hereditary
nonpolyposis colorectal cancer family. The mutation generated an mRNA
transcript with deletion of exons 10 and 11, which is indistinguishable
from one of the most common and predominant MLH1 splice variants. A
diagnostic test based on PCR of the breakpoint region led to the
identification of an additional young colorectal cancer patient with
this mutation. Haplotype analysis suggested that the 2 patients may
share a common ancestral mutation. The results represented a caveat to
investigators in the interpretation of alternative splicing and the
important implications for the design of MLH1 mutation detection
strategy in the Chinese population. The proband of one family developed
colorectal cancer at the age of 33 years. The second patient with no
family history of cancer developed colorectal cancer at the age of 38
years.

Viel et al. (2002) examined a series of 52 patients belonging to HNPCC
or HNPCC-related families, all of whom had previously tested negative
for point mutations in MMR genes. Southern blot mutation screening of
the MLH1 and MSH2 genes revealed abnormal restriction patterns in 3
patients who carried distinct MLH1 internal deletions. Although Alu
repeats are likely to be implicated in most cases of such deletions,
different molecular mechanisms may be involved. In particular, HNPCC
resulting from L1-mediated recombination was identified by Viel et al.
(2002) as another mechanism for MMR inactivating mutations.

Gorlov et al. (2003) evaluated colocalization of pathogenic missense
mutations (found in individuals with HNPCC) with high-score exonic
splicing enhancer (ESE) motifs in the MSH2 and MLH1 genes. They found
that pathogenic missense mutations in these genes are located in ESE
sites significantly more frequently than expected. Pathogenic missense
mutations also tended to decrease ESE scores, thus leading to a high
propensity for splicing defects. In contrast, nonpathogenic missense
mutations and nonsense mutations are distributed randomly in relation to
ESE sites. Comparison of the observed and expected frequencies of
missense mutations in ESE sites showed that pathogenic effects of 20% or
more of mutations in MSH2 result from disruption of ESE sites and
disturbed splicing. Similarly, pathogenic effects of 16% or more of
missense mutations in MLH1 genes are ESE related. Thus, the
colocalization of pathogenic missense mutations with ESE sites strongly
suggests that their pathogenic effects are splicing related.

Most susceptibility to colorectal cancer (CRC) is not accounted for by
known risk factors. Because MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6 mutations underlie high
penetrance CRC susceptibility in HNPCC, Lipkin et al. (2004)
hypothesized that attenuated alleles might also underlie susceptibility
to sporadic CRC. They looked for gene variants associated with HNPCC in
Israeli probands with familial CRC unstratified with respect to the
microsatellite instability phenotype. Association studies identified a
new MLH1 variant (415G-C; 120436.0019) in approximately 1.3% of Israeli
CRC individuals self-described as Jewish, Christian, or Muslim. MLH1
415C conferred clinically significant susceptibility to CRC. In contrast
to classic HNPCC, CRCs associated with MLH1 415C usually did not have
the microsatellite instability (MSI) defect, which is important for
clinical mutation screening. Structural and functional analyses showed
that the normal ATPase function of MLH1 is attenuated, but not
eliminated, by the MLH1 415G-C mutation. These studies suggested that
variants of mismatch repair proteins with attenuated function may
account for a higher proportion of susceptibility to sporadic
microsatellite-stable CRC than theretofore assumed.

Oliveira et al. (2004) investigated KRAS (190070) in 158 HNPCC tumors
from patients with germline MLH1, MSH2, or MSH6 mutations, 166
microsatellite-unstable (MSI-H), and 688 microsatellite-stable (MSS)
sporadic carcinomas. All tumors were characterized for MSI and 81 of 166
sporadic MSI-H CRCs were analyzed for MLH1 promoter hypermethylation.
KRAS mutations were observed in 40% of HNPCC tumors, and the mutation
frequency varied upon the mismatch repair gene affected: 48% (29/61) in
MSH2, 32% (29/91) in MLH1, and 83% (5/6) in MSH6 (P = 0.01). KRAS
mutation frequency was different between HNPCC, MSS, and MSI-H
colorectal cancers (P = 0.002), and MSI-H with MLH1 hypermethylation (P
= 0.005). Furthermore, HNPCC colorectal cancers had more G13D
(190070.0003) mutations than MSS (P less than 0.0001), MSI-H (P = 0.02),
or MSI-H tumors with MLH1 hypermethylation (P = 0.03). HNPCC colorectal
and sporadic MSI-H tumors without MLH1 hypermethylation shared similar
KRAS mutation frequency, in particular G13D. Oliveira et al. (2004)
concluded that, depending on the genetic/epigenetic mechanism leading to
MSI-H, the outcome in terms of oncogenic activation may be different,
reinforcing the idea that HNPCC, sporadic MSI-H (depending on the MLH1
status), and MSS colorectal cancers may target distinct kinases within
the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathway.

Mangold et al. (2004) screened for mutations in the MSH2 and MLH1 genes
in 41 unrelated index patients diagnosed with Muir-Torre syndrome
(MRTES; 158320), most of whom were preselected for mismatch repair
deficiency in their tumor tissue. Germline mutations were identified in
27 patients (mutation detection rate of 66%). Mangold et al. (2004)
noted that 25 (93%) of the mutations were located in MSH2, in contrast
to HNPCC patients without the MRTES phenotype, in whom the proportions
of MLH1 and MSH2 mutations are almost equal (p less than 0.001). Mangold
et al. (2004) further noted that 6 (22%) of the mutation carriers did
not meet the Bethesda criteria for HNPCC and suggested that sebaceous
neoplasm be added to the HNPCC-specific malignancies in the Bethesda
guidelines.

Alazzouzi et al. (2005) studied the allelic distribution of
microsatellite repeat bat26 in peripheral blood lymphocytes of 6
carriers and 4 noncarriers from 2 HNPCC families harboring germline MLH1
and MSH2 mutations, respectively. In noncarriers, there was a gaussian
distribution with no bat26 alleles shorter than 21 adenine residues. All
6 MLH1/MSH2 mutation carriers showed unstable bat26 alleles (20 adenine
residues or shorter) with an overall frequency of 5.6% (102 of 1814
clones detected). Alazzouzi et al. (2005) suggested that detection of
short unstable bat26 alleles may assist in identifying asymptomatic
carriers belonging to families with no detectable MMR gene mutations.

Quehenberger et al. (2005) obtained estimates of the risk of colorectal
cancer (CRC) and endometrial cancer (EC) for carriers of disease-causing
mutations of the MSH2 and MLH1 genes. Families with known germline
mutations of these genes were extracted from the Dutch HNPCC cancer
registry. Ascertainment-corrected maximum likelihood estimation was
carried out on a competing risks model for CRC and EC. The MSH2 and MHL1
loci were analyzed jointly as there was no significant difference in
risk (p = 0.08). At age 70, CRC risk for men was 26.7% (95% CI, 12.6 to
51.0%) and for women, 22.4% (10.6 to 43.8%); the risk for EC was 31.5%
(11.1 to 70.3%). These estimates of risk were considerably lower than
ones previously used which did not account for the selection of
families.

Changes in the coding sequence, which may or may not affect the encoded
protein sequence, may disrupt exon splicing enhancers (ESEs), leading to
exon skipping. ESEs are short, degenerate, frequently purine-rich
sequences that are important in both constitutive and alternative
splicing. ESEs have been identified in a large number of genes, and
their disruption has been linked to several genetic disorders, including
HNPCC (Stella et al., 2001), cystic fibrosis (219700), Marfan syndrome
(154700), and Becker muscular dystrophy (300376). McVety et al. (2006)
studied a 3-bp deletion at the 5-prime end of exon 3 of MLH1
(120436.0023), resulting in deletion of exon 3 from RNA. Splicing assays
suggested that the inclusion of exon 3 in mRNA was ESE-dependent. The
exon 3 ESE was not recognized by all available motif-scoring matrices,
highlighting the importance of RNA analysis in the detection of
ESE-disrupting mutations.

Pagenstecher et al. (2006) examined 19 variants in the MLH1 and MSH2
genes detected in patients with HNPCC for expression at the RNA level.
Ten of the 19 were found to affect splicing, including several variants
which were predicted to be missense mutations in exonic sequences (see,
e.g., 120436.0024). The findings suggested that mRNA examination of MLH1
and MSH2 mutations should precede functional tests at the protein
levels.

Without preselection and regardless of family history, Barnetson et al.
(2006) recruited 870 patients under the age of 55 years soon after they
received the diagnosis of colorectal cancer. They studied these patients
for germline mutations in DNA mismatch-repair genes MLH1, MSH2 (609309),
and MSH6 (600678) and developed a 2-stage model by multivariate logistic
regression for the prediction of the presence of mutations in these
genes. Stage 1 of the model incorporated only clinical variables; stage
2 comprised analysis of the tumor by immunohistochemical staining and
tests for microsatellite instability. The model was validated in an
independent population of patients. Furthermore, they analyzed 2,938
patient-years of follow-up to determine whether genotype influenced
survival. Among the 870 participants, 38 mutations were found: 15 in
MLH1, 16 in MSH2, and 7 in MSH6. Carrier frequencies in men (6%) and
women (3%) differed significantly (P less than 0.04). Survival among
carriers was not significantly different from that among noncarriers.

Tournier et al. (2008) examined potential splicing defects of 56
unclassified variants in the MLH1 gene and 31 in the MSH2 gene that were
identified in 82 French patients with Lynch syndrome. The variants
comprised 54 missense mutations, 10 synonymous changes, 20 intronic
variants, and 3 single-codon deletions. The authors developed an ex vivo
splicing assay by inserting PCR-amplified transcripts from patient
genomic DNA into a reporter minigene that was transfected into HeLa
cells. The ex vivo splicing assay showed that 22 of 85 variant alleles
affected splicing, including 4 exonic variants that affected putative
splicing regulatory elements. The study provided a tool for evaluating
putative pathogenic effects of unclassified variants found in these
genes.

Tang et al. (2009) identified pathogenic mutations or deletions in the
MLH1 or MSH2 gene in 61 (66%) of 93 Taiwanese families with HNPCC.
Forty-two families had MLH1 mutations, including 13 with the R265C
mutation (120436.0030) and 5 with a 3-bp deletion (1846delAAG;
120436.0018). Thirteen of the MLH1 mutations were novel, and 6 large
MLH1 deletions were also found. One family harbored MLH1 and MSH2
mutations.

Using structural modeling, Kosinski et al. (2010) identified 19
different MLH1 alterations located in the C-terminal domain involved in
dimerization with PMS2. Three changes, Q542L, L749P, and Y750X, caused
decreased coexpression of PMS2, which was unstable in the absence of
interaction with MLH1, suggesting that these 3 alterations interfered
with MLH1-PMS2 dimerization. In vitro studies showed that all 3 changes
compromised mismatch repair, suggesting that defects in dimerization can
abrogate proper MLH1 function. Additional biochemical studies showed
that 4 alterations with uncertain pathogenicity (A586P, L636P, T662P,
and R755W), could be considered deleterious because of poor expression
or poor MMR efficiency. Finally, some variants (e.g., K618A;
120436.0012), which were previously classified as deleterious, were
determined to have normal MMR activity.

- Constitutional Epigenetic Mutations, 'Germline Epimutation'

Herman et al. (1998) reported that hypermethylation of the 5-prime CpG
island of the MLH1 gene is found in most sporadic primary colorectal
cancers with MSI and that this methylation was often, but not
invariably, associated with loss of MLH1 protein expression. Such
methylation also occurred, but was less prominent, in MSI-negative
tumors, as well as in MSI-positive tumors with known mutations of a
mismatch repair gene. No hypermethylation of MSH2 was found.
Hypermethylation of colorectal cancer cell lines with MSI also was
frequently observed, and in such cases, reversal of the methylation with
5-aza-2-prime-deoxycytidine not only resulted in reexpression of MLH1
protein, but also in restoration of the mismatch repair capacity in
MMR-deficient cell lines. The results suggested that MSI in sporadic
colorectal cancer often results from epigenetic inactivation of MLH1 in
association with DNA methylation.

Germline defects in DNA mismatch repair genes account for the inherited
familial cancer syndrome of hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancers in
which affected individuals show accelerated development of cancers of
the proximal colon, endometrium (608089), and stomach. These cancers
typically demonstrate inactivation of the residual wildtype MMR allele
inherited opposite the germline mutant, absence of DNA MMR activity in
in vitro assays, and acquisition of an in vivo mutator phenotype showing
up to 1,000-fold increased gene mutation rates. Additionally, these
cancers display an associated instability of genomic MSI. MSI is
similarly found in approximately 15 to 20% of sporadic colon cancers
that arise in individuals without any family history of colon cancer.
Like HNPCC-associated colon cancers, sporadic MSI colon cancers arise
predominantly in the proximal colon and show a high rate of frameshift
mutations at a mutation hotspot in the transforming growth factor-beta
type II receptor tumor suppressor gene (TGFBR2; 190182). Familial and
sporadic MSI colon cancers thus appear to share a common carcinogenic
pathway. Liu et al. (1995) established that MMR gene inactivation via
somatic mutation was the cause of some cases of sporadic MSI colon
cancers. However, unexpectedly, in many sporadic MSI colon cancers, MMR
genes were found to remain wildtype. MMR coding sequences were similarly
reported to be wildtype in many sporadic MSI endometrial cancers
(Katabuchi et al., 1995). Kane et al. (1997) described methylation of
the MLH1 promoter region in some MSI tumors. Veigl et al. (1998)
investigated a group of MSI cancer cell lines, most of which were
documented as established from antecedent MSI-positive malignant tumors.
In 5 of 6 such cases, they found that MLH1 protein was absent, even
though MLH1-coding sequences were wildtype. In each case, absence of
MLH1 protein was associated with the methylation of the MLH1 gene
promoter. Furthermore, in each case, treatment with the demethylating
agent 5-azacytidine induced expression of the absent MLH1 protein.
Moreover, in single cell clones, MLH1 expression could be turned on,
off, and on again by 5-azacytidine exposure, washout, and reexposure.
This epigenetic inactivation of MLH1 additionally accounted for the
silencing of both maternal and paternal tumor MLH1 alleles, both of
which could be reactivated by 5-azacytidine. Thus, substantial numbers
of human MSI cancers appear to arise by MLH1 silencing via an epigenetic
mechanism that can inactivate both of the MLH1 alleles. Promoter
methylation is intimately associated with this epigenetic silencing
mechanism.

Approximately 20% of endometrial cancers, the fifth most common cancer
of women worldwide, exhibit MSI. Although the frequency of MSI is higher
in endometrial cancers than in any other common malignancy, the genetic
basis of MSI in these tumors had remained elusive. Simpkins et al.
(1999) investigated the role that methylation of the MLH1 DNA mismatch
repair gene plays in the genesis of MSI in a large series of sporadic
endometrial cancers. The MLH1 promoter was methylated in 41 of 53 (77%)
MSI-positive cancers investigated. In MSI-negative tumors, on the other
hand, there was evidence for limited methylation in only 1 of 11 tumors
studied. Immunohistochemical investigation of a subset of the tumors
revealed that methylation of the MLH1 promoter in MSI-positive tumors
was associated with loss of MLH1 expression. Immunohistochemistry proved
that 2 MSI-positive tumors lacking MLH1 methylation failed to express
the MSH2 mismatch repair gene. Both of these cancers came from women who
had family and medical histories suggestive of inherited cancer
susceptibility. These observations suggested that epigenetic changes in
the MLH1 locus account for MSI in most cases of sporadic endometrial
cancers and provide additional evidence that the MSH2 gene may
contribute substantially to inherited forms of endometrial cancer.

Wheeler et al. (2000) studied 10 MSI-positive sporadic colorectal
cancers and 10 colorectal cancers from individuals with HNPCC. The
promoter region of the MLH1 gene was hypermethylated in 7 of the 10
MSI-positive sporadic cancers but in none of the HNPCC cancers. LOH at
MLH1 was observed in 8 of the 10 HNPCC colorectal cancers. Wheeler et
al. (2000) concluded that while the mutations and allelic loss are
responsible for the MSI-positive phenotype in HNPCC cancers, the
majority of MSI-positive sporadic cancers are hypermethylated in the
promoter region of MLH1; therefore, tumors from HNPCC patients acquire a
raised mutation rate through a different pathway than MSI-positive
sporadic tumors.

Epigenetic silencing can mimic genetic mutation by abolishing expression
of a gene. Suter et al. (2004) hypothesized that an epimutation could
occur in any gene as a germline event that predisposes to disease and
looked for examples in tumor suppressor genes in individuals with
cancer. They reported 2 individuals with soma-wide, allele-specific and
mosaic hypermethylation of the DNA mismatch repair gene MLH1. Both
individuals lacked evidence of genetic mutation in any mismatch repair
gene but had had multiple primary tumors that showed mismatch repair
deficiency, and both met clinical criteria for hereditary nonpolyposis
colorectal cancer.

Suter et al. (2004) reported methylation of the MLH1 promoter in a small
proportion of FACS-sorted spermatozoa from an individual who harbored a
soma-wide MLH1 epimutation. In an addendum to the report of Suter et al.
(2004) and in a correspondence, Hitchins and Ward (2007) described
reassessment of spermatozoa from the original individual using 2
quantitative techniques. They included methylation analysis of the
imprinted control gene SNRPN (182279), which is unmethylated in
spermatozoa cells. Their new data indicated that the MLH1 methylation
previously reported in spermatozoa was most likely an artifact,
attributable to a low level of contamination of the sample with either
somatic cells or free DNA derived from somatic cells. These data altered
the original interpretation that incomplete resetting of the epigenetic
mark on MLH1 had occurred in a proportion of the individual's
spermatozoa and suggested instead that reversal is complete in the
actual gametes.

Persons who have hypermethylation of 1 allele of MLH1 in somatic cells
throughout the body (a germline epimutation) have a predisposition for
the development of cancer in a pattern typical of hereditary
nonpolyposis colorectal cancer. By studying the families of 2 such
persons, Hitchins et al. (2007) found evidence that the epimutation was
transmitted from a mother to her son but was erased in his spermatozoa.
The affected maternal allele was inherited by 3 other sibs from these 2
families, but in those offspring the allele had reverted to the normal
active state. These findings demonstrated a novel pattern of inheritance
of cancer susceptibility and were consistent with transgenerational
epigenetic inheritance.

Gosden and Feinberg (2007) referred to genetics and epigenetics as
'nature's pen-and-pencil set.' They suggested that transmission of
epimutations in MLH1 may have more general relevance than appears at
first site. Perhaps it is rather common for disease to be caused by the
failure of both the pen and pencil to write correctly. Bjornsson et al.
(2004) suggested an integrated epigenetic and genetic approach to common
human disease. The genetic and epigenetic model of common
diseases--including neuropsychiatric and rheumatologic diseases and
cancer--suggest that the epigenotype modulates genetic effects. The
epigenotype, in turn, is affected by the environment, the epigenotype of
the parents, age, and the genotype at loci that regulate DNA methylation
and chromatin.

Hitchins and Ward (2009) reviewed the etiologic role of constitutional
MLH1 epimutations (see, e.g., 120436.0015) in the development of
HNPCC-related cancers.

Crepin et al. (2012) identified constitutional MLH1 epimutations in 2
(1.5%) of 134 patients suspected of having Lynch syndrome who did not
have germline mutations in the MMR genes. One patient was a man who
developed colorectal cancer at age 35 years. Tumor tissue showed MSI,
and analysis of lymphocyte DNA showed complete hypermethylation of the
promoter of 1 MLH1 allele. The second patient was a woman with
colorectal cancer, who had a son with colorectal cancer and 2 daughters
with dysplastic colonic polyps. Blood from the mother showed 20%
hypermethylation at the MLH1 promoter, suggesting mosaicism. The son and
1 affected daughter also showed partial hypermethylation in blood,
suggesting transmission of the epimutation through the germline. Tumor
tissue from the 3 patients in the second family also showed partial
hypermethylation at MLH1, and tumor tissue from the daughter also
carried a somatic BRAF mutation (164757.0001).

Ward et al. (2013) screened 416 individuals with colorectal cancer
showing loss of MLH1 expression but without deleterious germline
mutations in MLH1. Constitutive DNA samples were screened for MLH1
methylation in all subjects and for promoter sequence changes in 357
individuals. Constitutional MLH1 epimutations were identified in 16
subjects. Of these, 7 (1.7%) had mono- or hemi-allelic methylation and 8
had low-level methylation (2%). Ward et al. (2013) concluded that
although rare, sequence changes in the regulatory region of MLH1 and
aberrant methylation may alone or together predispose to the development
of cancer and suggested that screening for these changes is warranted in
individuals who have a negative germline sequence screen of MLH1 and
loss of MLH1 expression in their tumor.

- Mismatch Repair Cancer Syndrome

Mismatch repair cancer syndrome (276300), sometimes referred to as brain
tumor-polyposis syndrome-1 or Turcot syndrome, results from biallelic
mutations in the mismatch repair genes. The phenotype classically
includes colorectal adenomas and brain tumors, most often glioblastoma.
However, Trimbath et al. (2001) and Ostergaard et al. (2005) noted that
the original definition may be too restrictive, and suggested that the
full manifestation of biallelic mutations in MMR genes includes the
additional findings of early-onset hematologic malignancies and
cafe-au-lait spots suggestive of neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1; 162200).

Hamilton et al. (1995) identified a mutation in the MLH1 gene
(120436.0003) in a patient with brain tumor-polyposis syndrome-1. He had
hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer, glioblastoma, and transitional
cell carcinoma of the ureter. Tumor tissue samples showed DNA
replication errors.

Ricciardone et al. (1999) reported 3 sibs in an HNPCC family who
developed hematologic malignancy at a very early age, 2 of whom
displayed signs of NF1. DNA sequence analysis and allele-specific
amplification in 2 of the sibs revealed a homozygous MLH1 mutation
(120436.0010). Wang et al. (1999) described a typical HNPCC family in
which MMR-deficient children who were homozygous for an MLH1 mutation
(120436.0011) exhibited clinical features of de novo NF1 and early onset
of extracolonic cancers. The observations demonstrated that MMR
deficiency is compatible with human development but may lead to
mutations during embryogenesis. Based on these observations, Wang et al.
(1999) speculated that the NF1 gene is a preferential target for such
alterations.

Wang et al. (2003) demonstrated that somatic mutations of the NF1 gene
occur more commonly in MMR-deficient cells. They observed NF1
alterations in 5 of 10 tumor cell lines with microsatellite instability
compared to none of 5 MMR-proficient tumor cell lines. Somatic NF1
mutations were also detected in 2 primary tumors exhibiting
microsatellite instability.

ANIMAL MODEL

Baker et al. (1996) generated mice with a null mutation of the Mlh1
gene. They reported that in addition to compromising replication
fidelity, Mlh1 deficiency appeared to cause both male and female
sterility associated with reduced levels of chiasmata. Mlh1-deficient
spermatocytes exhibited high levels of prematurely separated chromosomes
and cell cycle arrest occurred in the first division of meiosis. Baker
et al. (1996) also carried out analysis of the Mlh1 protein in
spermatocytes and oocytes using immunostaining. They demonstrated that
Mlh1 localizes at chiasma sites on meiotic chromosomes. They concluded
that Mlh1 in the mouse is involved in both DNA mismatch repair and
meiotic crossing over.

Linkage maps constructed from genetic analysis of gene order and
crossover frequency provide few clues to the basis of genomewide
distribution of meiotic recombination which might point to variation in
chromosome structure that influences meiotic recombination. To bridge
that gap, Froenicke et al. (2002) generated a cytologic recombination
map that identified individual autosomes in the male mouse. They
prepared synaptonemal complex (SC) meiotic chromosome spreads from mouse
spermatocytes, identified each autosome by multicolor FISH using
chromosome-specific DNA libraries, and mapped more than 2,000 sites of
recombination along individual autosomes, using immunolocalization of
Mlh1, which as a mismatch repair protein marks crossover sites. They
showed that SC length strongly correlated with crossover frequency and
distribution. Although the length of most of these SCs corresponded to
that predicted from their mitotic chromosome length rank, several SCs
were longer or shorter than expected, with corresponding increases and
decreases in Mlh1 frequency. Although all bivalents shared certain
recombination features, such as few crossovers near the centromeres and
a high rate of distal recombination, individual bivalents had unique
patterns of crossover distribution along their length. In addition to SC
length, other unidentified factors influenced crossover distribution,
leading to hot regions on individual chromosomes with recombination
frequencies as much as 6 times higher than average, as well as coldspots
with no recombination. By reprobing the SC spreads with genetically
mapped BACs, Froenicke et al. (2002) demonstrated a robust strategy for
integrating genetic linkage and physical contig maps with mitotic and
meiotic chromosome structure.

Avdievich et al. (2008) generated transgenic mice with a G67R mutation
in the Mlh1 gene located in 1 of the ATP-binding domains. Although cells
derived from homozygous mice showed defects in DNA repair, the mutation
did not affect the cellular response to DNA damage, including the
apoptotic response of epithelial cells in the intestinal mucosa. The
mice displayed a strong predisposition to cancer but developed
significantly fewer intestinal tumors compared to Mlh1-null mice.
Mlh1-null mice did show defects in the cellular response to DNA damage.
These findings suggested that missense mutations in the Mlh1 gene may
affect MMR tumor suppressor function in a tissue-specific manner. In
addition, homozygous G67R mice were sterile due to the inability of the
mutant protein to interact with meiotic chromosomes at pachynema,
demonstrating that the ATPase activity of Mlh1 is essential for
fertility in mammals.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 2
MLH1, SER252TER

In a colorectal tumor cell line (H6) (609310) manifesting microsatellite
instability, Papadopoulos et al. (1994) used a technique that involves
the transcription and translation in vitro of PCR products to
demonstrate that only a truncated polypeptide was produced. Sequence
analysis of the cDNA revealed a C-to-A transversion at codon 252,
resulting in the substitution of a stop codon for serine. No band at the
normal C position was identified in the cDNA or genomic DNA from the H6
cells, indicating that these cells were devoid of a wildtype MLH1
allele.

.0002
COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 2
MLH1, SER44PHE

In a family with hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (609310), Bronner
et al. (1994) found that 4 affected individuals were heterozygous for a
C-to-T substitution in an exon encoding amino acids 41 to 69, which
corresponds to a highly conserved region of the protein. The nucleotide
substitution resulted in a ser44-to-phe amino acid change.

MISMATCH REPAIR CANCER SYNDROME
MLH1, 3-BP DEL, LYS618DEL

In a man with mismatch repair cancer syndrome (276300), Hamilton et al.
(1995) identified a 3-bp deletion (AAG) in the MLH1 gene, resulting in
the loss of a lysine at codon 618. The patient had adenocarcinomas of
the ascending and transverse colon at the age of 30, adenomas of the
descending and sigmoid colon at the ages of 32 and 33, and an ileal
adenocarcinoma and a glioblastoma multiforme at the age of 33. There was
a family history of HNPCC. The patient was also reported to have a
transitional cell carcinoma of the ureter.

.0004
COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 2
MLH1, 3.5-KB DEL

Nystrom-Lahti et al. (1995) found that a 3.5-kb genomic deletion in the
MLH1 gene was responsible for 14 of 30 Finnish kindreds meeting
international diagnostic criteria for HNPCC (609310). The origins of the
families were clustered in the south-central region of Finland. The
mutation consisted of exon 15 and the proximal 2.4 kb of intron 15
joined to a distal half of intron 16 followed by intron 17. Introns 15
and 16 were found to be rich in Alu repetitive sequences. Sequence
analysis of the deletion breakpoint region in both mutant and normal
alleles suggested to Nystrom-Lahti et al. (1995) that the deletion may
have been due to recombination between 2 Alu repeat elements, 1 in
intron 15 and another in intron 16.

This large deletion mutation and the splice site mutation leading to
deletion of exon 6 (120436.0005), referred to by Moisio et al. (1996) as
mutations 1 and 2 respectively, are frequent among Finnish kindreds with
HNPCC. In order to assess the ages and origins of these mutations,
Moisio et al. (1996) constructed a map of 15 microsatellite markers
around MLH1 and used this information and haplotype analyses of 19
kindreds with mutation 1 and 6 kindreds with mutation 2. All kindreds
with mutation 1 showed a single allele for the intragenic marker D3S1611
that was not observed on any unaffected chromosome. They also shared
portions of a haplotype of markers encompassing 2.0 to 19.0 cM around
MLH1. All kindreds with mutation 2 shared another allele for D3S1611 and
a conserved haplotype of 5 to 14 markers spanning 2.0 to 15.0 cM around
MLH1. The degree of haplotype conservation was used to estimate the ages
of these 2 mutations. The analyses suggested to the authors that the
spread of mutation 1 started 16 to 43 generations (400 to 1,075 years)
ago and that of mutation 2 started 5 to 21 generations (125 to 525
years) ago. These datings were compatible with genealogic results
identifying a common ancestor born in the 16th and 18th century,
respectively. The results indicated to Moisio et al. (1996) that all
Finnish kindreds studied to date showing either mutation 1 or mutation 2
were the result of single ancestral founding mutations relatively recent
in origin in the population. Alternatively, it is possible that the
mutations arose elsewhere and were introduced into Finland more
recently.

.0005
COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 2
MLH1, IVS5, G-A, -1

In 5 Finnish families with HNPCC (609310), Nystrom-Lahti et al. (1995)
found that a splice site mutation in the MLH1 gene was responsible. The
mutation consisted of a G-to-A transition in the -1 position of the
splice acceptor site in intron 5. This resulted in deletion of the 92-bp
segment corresponding to exon 6 and caused a frameshift that led to a
premature stop codon 24-bp downstream.

.0006
MUIR-TORRE SYNDROME
MLH1, 370-BP DEL

Muir-Torre syndrome (MRTES; 158320) is an autosomal dominant disorder
characterized by development of sebaceous gland tumors and skin cancers,
including keratoacanthomas and basal cell carcinomas. Affected family
members may manifest a wide spectrum of internal malignancies, which
include colorectal, endometrial, urologic, and upper gastrointestinal
neoplasms. Sebaceous gland tumors, which are rare in the general
population, are considered to be the hallmark of MRTES, and may arise
prior to the development of other visceral cancers. Hereditary
nonpolyposis colorectal cancer shares many features in common with
MRTES, leading Lynch et al. (1985) to propose that these 2 syndromes
have a common genetic basis. Bapat et al. (1996) found a mutation in
MLH1 locus in a large, well-characterized kindred in which 17 affected
family members had colorectal and endometrial cancers, sebaceous gland
tumors, and hematopoietic malignancies. The family was originally
reported by Green et al. (1994) who excluded linkage to the MSH2 locus
(609309). Paraf et al. (1995) also described this family. Bapat et al.
(1996) studied 2 affected sibs and found by a protein-truncation test
(PTT) a truncated gene product of approximately 41 kD in addition to the
expected wildtype MLH1 protein of 53.9 kD. Further analysis discovered a
deletion of 370 bp (codons 346-467) corresponding to exon 12 of MLH1
cDNA. An examination of the MLH1 sequence indicated that deletion
generated a frameshift resulting in a stop codon at nucleotides
1472-1474 in exon 13 and a truncated protein of 40.8 kD. Linkage
analysis with an intragenic marker indicated that the affected parent
was heterozygous and the unaffected parent homozygous for the wildtype
allele.

.0007
COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 2
MLH1, IVS14DS, 7-BP DEL AND 4-BP INS

In 5 of 21 Danish families with HNPCC (609310) satisfying the Amsterdam
criteria, Jager et al. (1997) found a splice-donor mutation in intron 14
of MLH1: a combined 7-bp deletion and 4-bp insertion that led to the
exchange of the obligatory thymidine at position +2 and the exchange of
conserved purines at positions +3 to +5 in the splice donor site. Only 2
of 25 affected individuals suffered from extracolonic cancer. One
patient had endometrial cancer by the age of 33 years and 3 successive
colorectal cancers. The second patient had cancer of the ampulla of
vater by the age of 54 years and 4 colorectal cancers. The phenotype in
the families with the intron 14 mutation corresponded to Lynch syndrome
I. In 4 families with other types of intronic and splice site mutations,
almost 50% of affected individuals had extracolonic tumors corresponding
to Lynch syndrome II. Jager et al. (1997) suggested that clinical
surveillance could be restricted to colonic examinations in HNPCC gene
carriers with monoallelic MLH1 expression.

.0008
COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 2
MLH1, HIS329PRO

In a family that fulfilled the Amsterdam criteria of HNPCC (609310)
(Vasen et al., 1991), Wang et al. (1997) identified a his329-to-pro
germline mutation. That this mutation was of pathogenetic significance
was proved by finding the same missense mutation as a somatic event
('second hit') in colonic tumors of 2 other HNPCC patients who had
germline mutations at different sites of the MLH1 gene.

.0009
COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 2
MLH1, 1-BP DEL, 1784T

In a French-Canadian kindred, Yuan et al. (1998) found that a novel
truncating mutation, 1784delT, was associated with HNPCC (609310). The
I1307K APC polymorphism (175100.0029) was also segregating in the
family. This polymorphism, associated with an increased risk of
colorectal cancer, had previously been identified only in individuals of
self-reported Ashkenazi Jewish origin. In the French-Canadian family,
there appeared to be no relationship between the I1307K polymorphism and
the presence or absence of cancer.

COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 2
MISMATCH REPAIR CANCER SYNDROME, INCLUDED
MLH1, ARG226TER

In a hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (609310) family from
Turkey, Ricciardone et al. (1999) identified 3 sibs, born of
consanguineous parents, who developed hematologic malignancy at a very
early age, 2 of whom displayed signs of type I neurofibromatosis (NF1;
162200). Sequence analysis in the 3 sibs demonstrated homozygosity for a
676C-T mutation in the MLH1 gene, leading to an arg226-to-ter mutation
(R226X). Hematologic malignancy was diagnosed in all 3 by the age of 3
years. Both parents had colon cancer at an early age. The phenotype in
the sibs was consistent with the mismatch repair cancer syndrome
(276300), which manifests features of NF1 and hematologic malignancies.

Huang et al. (2001) studied a family with HNPCC in which the proband was
diagnosed with colorectal cancer at the age of 14 years; her mother,
grandmother, and aunt had been diagnosed with HNPCC in their twenties.
DNA sequencing revealed that she was heterozygous for the R226X
mutation. As this mutation is 2 bp from the 3-prime end of exon 8 and
might affect donor splicing, an in vitro transcription translation assay
was performed and confirmed the presence of the truncated peptide, which
lacked the critical PMS2-binding regions at its C terminus.

.0011
COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 2

MLH1, GLY67TRP

In 2 affected members of a consanguineous North African family in which
11 members of multiple generations developed colorectal cancers
(609310), 8 of them before the age of 50 years, Wang et al. (1999)
identified a heterozygous G-to-T transversion in exon 2 of the MLH1
gene, resulting in a gly67-to-trp (G67W) substitution. Two female
children who were homozygous for the mutation had early onset of
hematologic neoplastic disorders, including undifferentiated non-Hodgkin
malignant lymphoma, acute myeloid leukemia, and a medulloblastoma,
consistent with mismatch repair cancer syndrome (276300). In addition,
both sisters had clinical features of type I neurofibromatosis (NF1;
162200): one had multiple but strictly hemicorporal cafe-au-lait macules
and a pseudarthrosis of the tibia, whereas the other had 9 cafe-au-lait
spots. No other family member had NF1.

.0012
RECLASSIFIED - VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
MLH1, LYS618ALA

This variant, formerly titled COLON CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS,
TYPE 2, has been reclassified based on the findings of Kosinski et al.
(2010).

Liu et al. (1999) described 2 germline missense mutations in exon 16 of
the MLH1 gene associated with colorectal cancer (609310): lys618 to ala
and glu578 to gly (120436.0013). The tumors did not show the usual DNA
microsatellite instability (MSI) and would have been missed if this
method was used for selection of patients for mutation screening.

Using in vitro functional expression studies, Kosinski et al. (2010)
demonstrated that the K618A variant was fully expressed and retained MMR
activity, and that PMS2 (600259) was stable. The authors classified
K618A as a variant of uncertain significance rather than as disease
causing.

MLH1, EX16DEL

Vilkki et al. (2001) identified a homozygous deletion of exon 16 of the
MLH1 gene in a 4-year-old girl who died unexpectedly of brain hemorrhage
caused by glioma. She also had cafe-au-lait spots, including multiple
axillary freckles characteristic of NF1 (see 162200) without other
features of NF1. The phenotype in this girl was consistent with the
spectrum of mismatch repair cancer syndrome (276300). Both parents, who
had family histories of HNPCC (609310), were heterozygous for the
deletion.

.0015
COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 2
MLH1, HYPERMETHYLATION

Gazzoli et al. (2002) examined 14 cases suspected to represent
hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal carcinoma (609310) with
microsatellite instability (MSI), but in which no germline MSH2
(609309), MSH6 (600678), or MLH1 mutations were detected, for
hypermethylation of CpG sites in the critical promoter region of MLH1.
The methylation patterns were determined using methylation-specific PCR
and by sequence analysis of sodium bisulfite-treated genomic DNA. In 1
case, DNA hypermethylation of 1 allele was detected in DNA isolated from
blood. In the tumor from this case, which showed high microsatellite
instability, the unmethylated MLH1 allele was eliminated by loss of
heterozygosity, and the methylated allele was retained. This biallelic
inactivation resulted in loss of expression of MLH1 in the tumor as
confirmed by immunohistochemistry. These results suggested a novel mode
of germline inactivation of a cancer susceptibility gene.

Morak et al. (2008) identified hypermethylation of the MLH1 proximal
promoter region in peripheral blood cells of 12 (13%) of 94 unrelated
patients with tumors and loss of MLH1 protein expression without
mutations in the MLH1 gene. Normal colonic tissue, buccal mucosa, and
tumor tissue available from 3 patients also showed abnormal methylation
at the MLH1 promoter. Seven patients who were heterozygous for
informative SNPs showed allele-specific methylation that was not
restricted to either allelic variant. Five patients had about 50%
methylation, consistent with complete methylation of 1 allele. One
patient showed 100% methylation, and the rest showed mosaicism or
incomplete methylation. Hypermethylation was found in 1 mother-son pair,
suggesting familial predisposition for an epimutation. However, there
was no evidence for epigenetic inheritance in the remaining families,
and 6 patients showed a mosaic or incomplete methylation pattern, which
argued against inheritance. Morak et al. (2008) concluded that MLH1
hypermethylation in normal body cells may constitute a pre-lesion, and
that patients with such defects should be under surveillance.

Crepin et al. (2012) identified constitutional MLH1 epimutations in 2
(1.5%) of 134 patients suspected of having Lynch syndrome who did not
have germline mutations in the MMR genes. One patient was a man who
developed colorectal cancer at age 35 years. Tumor tissue showed MSI,
and analysis of lymphocyte DNA showed complete hypermethylation of the
promoter of 1 MLH1 allele. The second patient was a woman with
colorectal cancer, who had a son with colorectal cancer and 2 daughters
with dysplastic colonic polyps. Blood from the mother showed 20%
hypermethylation at the MLH1 promoter, suggesting mosaicism. The son and
1 affected daughter also showed partial hypermethylation in blood,
suggesting transmission of the epimutation through the germline. Tumor
tissue from the 3 patients in the second family also showed partial
hypermethylation at MLH1, with loss of MLH1 expression in 2. Finally,
tumor tissue from the daughter also carried a somatic BRAF mutation
(164757.0001).

.0016
COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 2
MLH1, -42, C-T

Green et al. (2003) described, in a Newfoundland kindred, the first
report of a heritable MLH1 promoter mutation in HNPCC (609310). The
-42C-T mutation was within a putative Myb protooncogene (189990) binding
site. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, they demonstrated
that the mutated Myb binding sequence was less effective in binding
nuclear proteins than the wildtype promoter sequence. Using in vivo
transfection experiments in HeLa cells, they further demonstrated that
the mutated promoter had only 37% of the activity of the wildtype
promoter in driving the expression of a reporter gene. The average age
of onset in 6 family members affected with colorectal cancer was 62
years, which is substantially later than the typical age of onset in
HNPCC families. This finding was considered consistent with the
substantial decrease, but not total elimination, of mismatch repair
function in affected members of this kindred.

.0017
COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 2
MLH1, THR117MET

The majority of mutations associated with HNPCC occur in the MSH2
(609309) and MLH1 genes (see 120435 and 609310, respectively). Wei et
al. (2003) studied these 2 genes in 15 Taiwanese HNPCC kindreds meeting
the Amsterdam criteria, using both RNA- and DNA-based methods. In the 15
kindreds they found no MSH2 mutations and mutations in MLH1 in 3
kindreds (20%), which is lower than that reported in other countries.
Two novel deletions were found and 1 mutation had been reported several
times in western countries (Maliaka et al., 1996; Liu et al., 1996;
Trojan et al., 2002). A C-to-T transition in codon 117 in exon 4
resulted in an amino acid change from threonine to methionine.

.0018
COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 2
MLH1, LYS616DEL

In 4 cases of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (609310), Taylor
et al. (2003) found deletion of 3 nucleotides: 1846-1848delAAG resulting
in deletion of lys616 (K616del) from the MLH1 protein. This mutation had
been previously observed by Miyaki et al. (1995). Taylor et al. (2003)
used the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLDA) assay
to demonstrate the deletion.

Tang et al. (2009) identified a heterozygous 1846delAAG mutation in
affected members of 5 Taiwanese families with HNPCC2.

.0019
COLORECTAL CANCER, SPORADIC, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
MLH1, ASP132HIS

Using a novel high density oligonucleotide array (HNPCC Chip) to look
for variants in the MLH1, MSH2 (609309), and MSH6 (600678) genes in
Israeli probands with familial colorectal cancer (CRC; 114500)
unstratified with respect to the microsatellite instability phenotype,
Lipkin et al. (2004) identified a 415G-C translation in the MLH1 gene,
resulting in an asp132-to-his (D132H) amino acid substitution. MLH1 415C
conferred clinically significant susceptibility to CRC. In contrast to
classic HNPCC, CRCs associated with MLH1 415C usually did not have the
microsatellite instability (MSI) defect, which is important for clinical
mutation screening. Structural and functional analyses showed that the
normal ATPase function of MLH1 was attenuated, but not eliminated, by
the MLH1 415G-C mutation.

MLH1, PRO648SER

In 8 affected members of a Danish family with HNPCC (609310) reported by
Bisgaard et al. (2002), Raevaara et al. (2004) identified a
pro648-to-ser (P648S) mutation in the MLH1 gene. Only 1 member, a
6-year-old child with first-cousin parents, was homozygous for the
mutation. She had mild features of type I neurofibromatosis (162200) and
no hematologic cancers. She displayed cafe-au-lait spots and a skin
tumor clinically diagnosed as a neurofibroma, but no axillary freckles
or other abnormalities. The phenotype was consistent with the spectrum
of mismatch repair cancer syndrome (276300). Raevaara et al. (2004)
commented that the mutated protein was unstable but still functional in
mismatch repair, suggesting that the cancer susceptibility in the family
and possibly also the mild disease phenotype in the homozygous
individual were linked to shortage of the functional protein.

.0021
COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 2
MLH1, SER269TER

In a 30-year-old patient who had developed colon cancer (609310) at the
age of 22 years, Rey et al. (2004) identified a homozygous 806C-G
transversion in exon 10 of the MLH1 gene, resulting in a ser269-to-thr
(S269T) substitution. Many members of the paternal and maternal families
presented with colon cancer, gastric polyposis, or breast cancer. A
founder effect was proposed because both ancestral families originated
from the same small region in the south of France. A complete MLH1
inactivation was thought to have been responsible for the precocity of
colon cancer and the more aggressive phenotype in this patient.
Relatives could not be studied.

.0022
COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 2
MLH1, ALA681THR

In a screen of 226 patients from families matching the Amsterdam II
diagnostic criteria or suspected HNPCC criteria for MSH2 (609309) and
MLH1 germline mutations, Kurzawski et al. (2006) found the ala681-to-thr
(A681T) change of MLH1 in 8 Polish families, consistent with HNPCC2
(609310). They concluded that this, the most frequently occurring
mutation of MLH1 in Poland, was a founder mutation. The amino acid
substitution resulted from a 2041G-to-A transition in exon 18.

.0023
COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 2
MLH1, 3-BP DEL, 213AGA

McVety et al. (2006) demonstrated the presence of an exon splicing
enhancer (ESE) in exon 3 of MLH1 and showed that a 3-bp in-frame
deletion (213_215delAGA) in this ESE was the cause of HNPCC (609310) in
a Quebec family. The deletion resulted in loss of codon 71 and caused
skipping of exon 3 during mRNA splicing.

.0024
COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 2
MLH1, EX18DEL

In 4 unrelated patients with HNPCC (609310), Pagenstecher et al. (2006)
identified a heterozygous 2103G-C transversion in the MLH1 gene. The
change was predicted to result in a gln701-to-his (Q701H) substitution,
but RNA analysis showed that it resulted in a splicing defect and
complete loss of exon 18.

.0025
COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 2
MLH1, EPIGENETICALLY SILENCED

Some epigenetic changes can be transmitted unchanged through the
germline (termed 'epigenetic inheritance'). Evidence that this mechanism
occurs in humans was provided by Suter et al. (2004) by the
identification of individuals in whom 1 allele of the MLH1 gene was
epigenetically silenced throughout the soma (implying a germline event).
These individuals were affected by hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal
cancer but did not have identifiable mutations in MLH1, even though it
was silenced, which demonstrated that an epimutation can phenocopy a
genetic disease.

.0026
COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 2
MLH1, EPIGENETICALLY SILENCED INHERITED

Hitchins et al. (2007) described a family in which a 66-year-old woman,
the mother of 3 sons by 2 different mates, had the clinical picture of
hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer. She had metachronous
carcinomas that had microsatellite instability and lacked MLH1
expression. The diagnosis of cancer of the endometrium was made at the
age of 45; of the colon, at age 59; and of the rectum at 60 years. She
was heterozygous for a SNP within the MLH1 promoter (dbSNP rs1800734),
with methylation confined to the A allele. In this woman methylation of
the A allele on approximately 50% of chromosomes was confirmed by
sulfite sequencing. Hitchins et al. (2007) identified an expressible C-T
SNP within MLH1 exon 16 in her son, which was used to demonstrate that
he was transcribing RNA only from the MLH1 allele inherited from his
father. The data were consistent with transmission of the MLH1
epimutation from the proband to her son. In DNA from peripheral blood
leukocytes obtained from this son, approximately half of the MLH1
alleles were methylated. In contrast, his sperm had no trace of MLH1
methylation, despite containing equal proportions of alleles derived
from his father and mother. Furthermore, analysis of the RNA in his
sperm at the MLH1 exon 16 C-T SNP showed reactivation of the maternally
derived MLH1 allele. These results indicated reversion of the MLH1
epimutation to normality during spermatogenesis, suggesting a negligible
risk of transmission from that family member.

In a 4-year-old boy with glioblastoma, nephroblastoma, and cafe-au-lait
spots consistent with mismatch repair cancer syndrome (276300), Poley et
al. (2007) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
MLH1 gene: a 2-bp deletion (593delAG) and a met35-to-asn (M35N;
120436.0028) substitution. Both tumors and normal tissue were negative
for the MLH1 protein. The nephroblastoma showed microsatellite
instability, but the glioblastoma did not. Both parents, who were each
heterozygous for a respective mutation, came from families with HNPCC2
(609310).

See 120436.0027 and Poley et al. (2007).

.0029
COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 2
MLH1, GLY67GLU

In affected members of a family with HNPCC2 (609310), Clyne et al.
(2009) identified a heterozygous 200G-A transition in exon 2 of the MLH1
gene, resulting in a gly67-to-glu (G67E) substitution. The male proband
had breast cancer, leiomyosarcoma of the thigh, colon cancer, and
prostate cancer. Other relatively unusual tumors in other affected
family members included esophageal cancer, cervical adenosquamous
carcinoma, oligodendroglioma, and prostate cancer. In vitro functional
expression assays in yeast showed that the G67E-mutant protein
interfered with the ability to prevent the accumulation of mutations,
consistent with a loss of function.

.0030
COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 2
MLH1, ARG265CYS

In affected members of 13 Taiwanese families with HNPCC2 (609310), Tang
et al. (2009) identified a heterozygous 793C-T transition in exon 10 of
the MLH1 gene, resulting in an arg265-to-cys (R265C) substitution. The
mutation was not found in 300 controls. Cancers that occurred included
colon, rectal, gastric, endometrial, ovarian, breast, and others.
Haplotype analysis indicated 2 common haplotypes, 1 of which was shared
by 10 families, suggesting a common origin in China several centuries
ago.

.0031
COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 2
MLH1, 11.6-KB DEL

In 14 unrelated patients and 95 family members among a series of 84
Lynch syndrome (see 609310) families with germline mutations in MLH1,
MSH2 (609309), or MSH6 (600678), Pinheiro et al. (2011) identified an
identical exonic rearrangement affecting MLH1 and the contiguous LRRFIP2
gene (614043). All 14 probands harbored an 11,627-bp deletion comprising
exons 17 through 19 of the MLH1 gene and exons 26 through 29 of the
LRRFIP2 gene. The 5-prime and 3-prime breakpoints were located 280 bp
downstream of MLH1 exon 16 and 678 bp upstream of LRRFIP2 exon 25,
respectively (Chr3: 37.089-37.101 Mb, GRCh37). The mutation was
therefore designated 1896+280_oLRRFIP2:1750-678del. This mutation
represented 17% of all deleterious mismatch repair mutations in their
series. Haplotype analysis showed a conserved region of approximately 1
Mb, and the mutation age was estimated to be 283 +/- 78 years, or to the
beginning of the 18th century. All 14 families originated from the Porto
district countryside. Pinheiro et al. (2011) recommended using this
mutation as first line screening for Lynch syndrome among families of
Portuguese descent.

.0032
COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 2
MLH1, IVS3DS, G-A, +5

In 17 Spanish families originating from northern Spain with HNPCC2
(609310), Borras et al. (2010) identified a G-to-A transition in intron
3 of the MLH1 gene (306+5G-A). RT-PCR on patient lymphocytes showed an
aberrant mRNA transcript expected to generate a truncated protein. This
transcript was associated with an increased amount of a transcript
corresponding to the in-frame skipping of exon 3. Although the variant
is pathogenic at the RNA level, neither abnormal bands nor differences
in protein expression were observed in lymphocytes from carriers,
suggesting that the mutant protein was unstable. By age 70, the lifetime
risk of colorectal cancer in carriers was estimated at 20.1% in men and
14.1% in women. A common haplotype was identified, consistent with a
founder effect, and the age of the mutation was estimated to be from 53
to 122 generations.

.0033
COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 2
MLH1, LEU622HIS

In 12 Spanish families originating from southern Spain with HNPCC2
(609310), Borras et al. (2010) identified a 1865T-A transversion in the
MLH1 gene, resulting in a leu622-to-his (L622H) substitution in a highly
conserved residue at the interaction domain for MutL. In vitro
functional expression studies showed that the substitution resulted in
decreased amounts of the MLH1 protein. Five of 6 tumors analyzed lost
the MLH1 wildtype allele, suggesting a growth advantage with loss of the
wildtype protein. By age 70, the lifetime risk of colorectal cancer in
carriers was estimated at 6.8% in men and 7.26% in women. A common
haplotype was identified, consistent with a founder effect, and the age
of the mutation was estimated to be from 12 to 22 generations.

.0034
MISMATCH REPAIR CANCER SYNDROME
MLH1, LEU73ARG

In a boy with mismatch repair cancer syndrome (276300), Baas et al.
(2013) identified a homozygous 218T-to-G transversion in exon 3 of the
MLH1 gene, resulting in a leu73-to-arg (L73R) substitution. His parents
were unrelated, but originated from the same Polynesian Pacific Island
population. In vitro functional expression studies showed that the
mutant protein had no DNA repair activity. The patient first presented
with a glioblastoma multiforme and later developed a T-cell
lymphoblastic lymphoma. He died of sepsis at the end of treatment. Brain
imaging showed near complete agenesis of the corpus callosum,
interhemispheric and intracerebral cysts, and right subcortical and
periventricular heterotopia. He was also noted to have multiple
cafe-au-lait spots. The maternal family history was positive for
colorectal cancer.

608277	TITLE *608277 CARBOHYDRATE SULFOTRANSFERASE 15; CHST15
;;B-CELL RAG-ASSOCIATED GENE; BRAG;;
N-ACETYLGALACTOSAMINE 4-SULFATE 6-O-SULFOTRANSFERASE;;
GalNAc4S-6ST;;
KIAA0598
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned KIAA0598. The 3-prime untranslated
region of the transcript contains an Alu repeat. The deduced 561-amino
acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of about 72 kD. RT-PCR
detected high expression in all tissues examined.

By differential display of genes coexpressed with RAG1 (179615),
followed by screening a pre-B-cell cDNA library, Verkoczy et al. (1998)
cloned BRAG. The deduced protein contains 503 amino acids and has a
calculated molecular mass of 55 kD. In vitro translation resulted in a
doublet that migrated between 69 and 49 kD by SDS-PAGE. BRAG is a type
II transmembrane glycoprotein with an 81-amino acid cytoplasmic N
terminus, followed by a transmembrane domain, and a 405-amino acid
extracellular C terminus. The N terminus contains a putative
palmitoylation site and several phosphorylation sites, and the C
terminus contains 4 putative N-glycosylation sites. Verkoczy et al.
(1998) also identified a putative splice variant that contains an
in-frame 12-bp deletion. Northern blot analysis detected a 5.0-kb BRAG
transcript expressed in all B-cell lines that also expressed RAG1.
Little or no expression was detected in several nonlymphoid cell lines,
and no expression was detected in T-cell lines, irrespective of RAG1
expression. Northern blot analysis of whole tissues detected expression
in bone marrow and tonsil, but not in heart, thymus, or placenta. RNA
dot blot analysis detected high levels in fetal and adult spleen,
peripheral blood leukocytes, and lymph node, moderate levels in heart,
ovary, stomach, and brain putamen, and low levels in bone marrow and
several other tissues. Zoo blot analysis performed under low stringency
conditions indicated that the BRAG gene is conserved across eukaryotes.
High stringency conditions revealed predominant bands only in human and
baboon DNA.

Verkoczy et al. (2000) determined that BRAG is a membrane-integrated
glycoprotein that is expressed as a disulfide-linked dimer in B cells.
They found glycosylated and unglycosylated forms of BRAG, with apparent
molecular masses of about 63 and 52 kD, respectively, in the
intracellular fraction of tonsillar B cells and in transfected
erythroleukemia cells; only the glycosylated product associated with the
cell surface.

Ohtake et al. (2001) determined that the KIAA0589 protein (Nagase et
al., 1998) shares significant similarity with GalNAc4S-6ST purified from
squid cartilage. They also noted that the nucleotide sequence of
KIAA0598 is nearly identical to that of BRAG (Verkoczy et al., 1998),
but the deduced proteins are significantly different. However, the
KIAA0598 and BRAG proteins are both type II transmembrane proteins, and
both contain a 3-prime-phosphoadenosine 5-prime-phosphosulfate
(PAPS)-binding domain characteristic of most sulfotransferases.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yuki et al. (2000) determined that the BRAG gene contains 7 exons.

GENE FUNCTION

Verkoczy et al. (1998) showed that BRAG induced RAG1 expression
following transfection into a B-cell line, but not following
transfection into a nonlymphoid cell line.

Verkoczy et al. (2000) found that BRAG associated with phosphorylated
proteins in unstimulated mature B cells, but not in B cells activated
through B-cell receptor cross-linking. They presented evidence that BRAG
functions as a cell surface receptor capable of cell signaling.

Ohtake et al. (2001) characterized the enzymatic activity of KIAA0598,
which they designated GalNAc4S-6ST, following transfection into COS-7
cells and confirmed that it displays sulfotransferase activity. They
found that GalNAc4S-6ST catalyzed the transfer of sulfate from PAPS to
position 6 of the nonreducing terminal and internal N-acetylgalatosamine
4-sulfate residues in chondroitin sulfate A and dermatan sulfate. Only
nonreducing terminal N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate residues were
sulfated when a trisaccharide and a pentasaccharide with sulfated groups
at position 4 of N-acetylgalactosamine residues were used as acceptors.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the KIAA0598
gene to chromosome 10.

By somatic cell hybrid analysis and FISH, Verkoczy et al. (1998) mapped
the CHST15 gene to chromosome 10q26. Using Southern blot analysis, they

;;C3ORF29;;
EGG-DERIVED TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF;;
HJUMPY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The MTMR14 gene encodes a muscle-specific inositide phosphatase that
acts specifically on phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P2),
and possibly other targets, and plays a critical role in skeletal muscle
calcium homeostasis and likely other cellular processes (summary by
Romero-Suarez et al., 2010).

CLONING

From a database screen for protein sequences similar to human
myotubularin (300415), which is mutated in a form of centronuclear
myopathy (CNMX; 310400), Tosch et al. (2006) identified a novel protein,
MTMR14, with high homology to Drosophila egg-derived tyrosine
phosphatase (EDTP). The authors called this protein hJUMPY because
disruption of EDTP protein function in Drosophila causes a phenotype
termed JUMPY: a muscle defect and a progressive loss of muscle control
together with shaky and slower movements. The deduced 650-amino acid
MTMR14 protein contains a predicted protein tyrosine phosphatase and
dual-specificity phosphatase (PTP/DSP) domain and the canonical C(X)5R
consensus present in active PTP/DSPs. The MTMR14 catalytic loop shows
closest resemblance to that of active myotubularins. Northern blot
analysis detected a 2.5-kb MTMR14 transcript with highest expression in
skeletal muscle and heart and lower expression in placenta, kidney,
liver, pancreas, and lung. Immunofluorescence studies showed that MTMR14
localizes to cytoplasmic reticular structures and plasma membrane
ruffles, and displays a concentration near the nucleus of COS-1 cells.
MTMR14 was more concentrated in structures positive for giantin
(602500), a Golgi marker.

Shen et al. (2009) identified the MTMR14 protein as a phosphatase
predominantly expressed in skeletal and heart muscle. The human and
mouse proteins share 90% amino acid sequence homology.

GENE FUNCTION

By quantitative PCR in mice, Tosch et al. (2006) showed that expression
of Mtmr14 increased with C2C12 myotubule formation and differentiation
in culture. Using in vitro and ex vivo approaches, Tosch et al. (2006)
demonstrated that MTMR14 is a PPIn 3-phosphatase that dephosphorylates
the same substrates as myotubularin, PtdIns(3)P and PtdIns(3,5)P2.

Shen et al. (2009) also demonstrated that MTMR14 dephosphorylates a
variety of PtdInsPs, particularly PtdIns(3,5)P2.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tosch et al. (2006) determined that the MTMR14 gene contains 19 exons;
EST database analysis indicated that exons 17 and 18 are alternatives.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Tosch et al. (2006) mapped the MTMR14 gene
to chromosome 3p25.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Tosch et al. (2006) described 2 sporadic cases of centronuclear myopathy
in which each proband carried a heterozygous missense mutation in the
MTMR14 gene. The first proband and his unaffected father carried an
R336Q substitution (611089.0001). A second mutant allele was postulated,
but not identified. The other proband carried a Y462C substitution in
MTMR14 (611089.0002) and an additional missense mutation in DYN2 (E368K;
602378.0007), consistent with autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy
(160150). The Y462C mutation was also found in a control individual.
Both variants impaired enzymatic function, the R336Q mutation strongly
and the Y462C mutation to a lesser extent. Tosch et al. (2006) remarked
that myotubular myopathy patients with other characterized mutations in
DYN2 usually have an age of onset in childhood or adulthood, whereas the
age of onset in their patient was neonatal. The report raised the
possibility of MTMR14 being a modifier of the phenotype in some cases of
centronuclear myopathy.

ANIMAL MODEL

Shen et al. (2009) found that Mtmr14-null mice had muscle weakness and
increased fatigue with exercise. Isolated muscles from mutant mice
showed decreased contractile force, exacerbated fatigue, and prolonged
relaxation compared to muscle from wildtype mice. Mtmr14 deficiency
resulted in increased elevated resting calcium levels in myotubes due to
spontaneous calcium leakage from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This
leakage was attributed to decreased activity of Mtmr14 phosphatase
activity and accumulation of substrates, especially PtdIns(3,5)P2 and
PtdIns(3,4)P2. In addition, PtdIns(3,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4)P2 bound to and
directly activated the RYR1 (180901) calcium release channel in the
sarcoplasmic reticulum. The findings indicated that fine control of
PtdInsP levels in muscle cells is essential for maintaining calcium
homeostasis and muscle performance.

Normal aging is associated with sarcopenia, or a decrease in muscle mass
and function. Romero-Suarez et al. (2010) found that Mtmr14-null mice
manifested features of sarcopenia much earlier (12 to 14 months)
compared to wildtype mice (22 to 24 months). In particular, young and
mature mutant mice behaved like old wildtype mice, indicating earlier
onset of locomotor dysfunction in mutant mice. These changes were
associated with muscle atrophy and a decrease in contractile force and
power in the muscles of mutant mice. Wildtype mice showed downregulation
of Mtmr14 during normal aging, and muscle tissue from both old wildtype
and mutant mature mice showed dysfunctional calcium homeostasis, with
increased resting calcium levels and decreased calcium release from the
sarcoplasmic reticulum when triggered. The findings indicated that
Mtmr14 is a potent regulator of skeletal muscle function under normal
conditions and that its downregulation may contribute to age-related
sarcopenia. Romero-Suarez et al. (2010) concluded that loss of Mtmr14
results in altered PtdIns(3,5)P2 signaling, as well as altered calcium
signaling, which can affect a variety of cell processes.

Dowling et al. (2010) examined zebrafish MTMR14 using gene dosage
manipulation. As with MTM1 (300415) knockdown, morpholino-mediated
knockdown of MTMR14 resulted in morphologic abnormalities, a
developmental motor phenotype characterized by diminished spontaneous
contractions and abnormal escape response, and impaired
excitation-contraction coupling. In contrast to MTM1 knockdown, however,
muscle ultrastructure was unaffected. Double knockdown of MTM1 and
MTMR14 significantly impaired motor function and altered skeletal muscle
ultrastructure. The combined effect of reducing levels of both MTMR14
and MTM1 was significantly more severe than either knockdown alone, an
effect which may be mediated by increased autophagy. The authors
concluded that MTMR14 is required for motor function and, in combination
with MTM1, is required for myocyte homeostasis and normal embryonic
development.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MYOPATHY, CENTRONUCLEAR, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT, MODIFIER OF
MTMR14, ARG336GLN

Tosch et al. (2006) reported a 12-year old Brazilian boy with
centronuclear myopathy (160150) who presented with neonatal hypotonia,
proximal muscle weakness, and ophthalmoparesis. Both he and his
clinically unaffected father were heterozygous for a 1007G-A transition
in exon 11 of the MTMR14 gene. The mutation was predicted to result in
an arg336-to-gln (R336Q) substitution in a highly conserved region of
the active site of the protein. The mutation was not found in 820
control chromosomes. Immunoprecipitation assays detected a strong
decrease in the phosphatase activity of the R336Q mutant, 22% of the
level of wildtype. A second mutation in MTMR14 was not identified, and
the patient did not have a mutation in exons or splice sites of the DNM2
gene (602378). Tosch et al. (2006) hypothesized that another mutant
allele in either the MTMR14 gene or in another gene must be present.

.0002
MYOPATHY, CENTRONUCLEAR, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT, MODIFIER OF
MTMR14, TYR462CYS

Tosch et al. (2006) reported a 36-year-old woman with centronuclear
myopathy-1 (160150) caused by a heterozygous missense mutation in the
DNM2 gene (E368K; 602378.0007) who also carried a heterozygous 1385A-G
transition in exon 16 of the MTMR14 gene, resulting in a tyr462-to-cys
(Y462C) substitution in a semiconserved region outside of the active
site of the protein. The Y462C mutation was found in 1 of 700 Brazilian
control chromosomes. The Y462C mutant displayed 80% of the phosphatase
activity of the wildtype protein in immunoprecipitation assays. Both
mutations occurred de novo. The patient presented with neonatal
hypotonia, muscle weakness, and ophthalmoparesis. The report raised the
possibility of MTMR14 being a modifier of the phenotype in some cases of
centronuclear myopathy.

;;MITOCHONDRIAL 12S rRNA DIMETHYLASE 1;;
DIMETHYLADENOSINE TRANSFERASE 1, MITOCHONDRIAL;;
CGI75;;
mtTFB1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The transcription of genes from mitochondrial DNA requires a
mitochondrial RNA polymerase (see POLRMT, 601778) and a DNA-binding
transcription factor (see TFAM, 600438). Transcription factor B1 (TFB1M)
is a part of this transcription complex.

CLONING

By database searching for sequences showing homology to S. cerevisiae
and S. pombe TFB proteins, McCulloch et al. (2002) identified human
TFB1M, which they designated CGI-75, and assembled the complete sequence
from available ESTs. The deduced 346-amino acid protein shares 16%
identity with the S. pombe homolog. Upon transfection into HeLa cells,
fluorescence-labeled TFB1M colocalized with mitochondrial markers in a
punctate cytoplasmic staining pattern.

GENE FUNCTION

By gel mobility shift assay, McCulloch et al. (2002) found that
recombinant TFB1M binds to the mitochondrial light strand promoter
(LSP). With addition of a nonspecific competitor to the reaction, they
determined that the binding is largely independent of the DNA sequence.
They further found that TFB1M significantly enhanced transcription from
LSP by TFAM in an in vitro mitochondrial transcription reaction, but was
itself transcriptionally inactive. McCulloch et al. (2002) noted
sequence similarity between TFB1M and several rRNA adenine
dimethyltransferase enzymes and verified by solid-phase in vitro binding
assays that recombinant TFB1M could bind S-adenosylmethionine.

Seidel-Rogol et al. (2003) showed that TFB1M appears to be a
dual-function protein, acting both as a transcription factor and as an
rRNA modification enzyme. The data showed that the protein methylates a
conserved stem-loop in bacterial 16S rRNA and that the homologous
sequence in the human mitochondrial 12S molecule is similarly modified.

Cotney et al. (2009) demonstrated that TFB1M and TFB2M (607055) are key
downstream effectors of mitochondrial biogenesis that perform unique,
yet cooperative functions. The primary function of TFB2M is mtDNA
transcription and maintenance, which is independent of its rRNA
methyltransferase activity, while that of TFB1M is mitochondrial 12S
rRNA (561000) methylation needed for normal mitochondrial translation,
metabolism, and cell growth. Overexpression of TFB1M caused 12S rRNA
hypermethylation, aberrant mitochondrial biogenesis, and increased
sorbitol-induced cell death. These phenotypes were recapitulated in
cells harboring the pathogenic 1555A-G mtDNA mutation (561000.0001),
implicating a deleterious rRNA methylation-dependent retrograde signal
in maternally inherited deafness (221745) pathology.

GENE STRUCTURE

By sequence analysis of the genomic DNA directly upstream from TFB1M,
McCulloch et al. (2002) identified putative binding sites for several
nuclear transcription factors, including 2 sites for nuclear respiratory
factor-2 (600609), which activates the transcription of several
nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the TFB1M
gene to chromosome 6 (TMAP stSG3392).

605551	TITLE *605551 NITRIC OXIDE SYNTHASE 1 (NEURONAL) ADAPTOR PROTEIN; NOS1AP
;;C-TERMINAL PDZ DOMAIN LIGAND OF NEURONAL NITRIC OXIDE SYNTHASE; CAPON
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using the first 377 amino acids of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS1;
163731) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen, Jaffrey et al. (1998)
isolated cDNAs encoding rat NOS1AP, which they called CAPON. One cDNA
encoded a deduced 125-amino acid protein and the other a 327-amino acid
protein. The N-terminal 145-amino acid stretch had residues suggestive
of a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain. Northern blot analysis
detected a predominant 7.5-kb transcript only in rat brain regions, with
no expression evident in adrenal, bladder, heart, kidney, lung, and
skeletal muscle. Marked regional variations occurred in brain, with
highest density in the cerebral cortex and medulla oblongata and lowest
levels in the hippocampus.

By PCR of a human fetal brain cDNA library, Xu et al. (2005) cloned 2
splice variants of NOS1AP, NOS1AP-L and NOS1AP-S. NOS1AP-L encodes the
deduced full-length, 501-amino acid protein, which contains an
N-terminal PTB domain and a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain. NOS1AP-S
encodes a deduced 211-amino acid protein with a unique 18-amino acid N
terminus and a C terminus containing the PDZ-binding domain. Western
blot analysis of human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex samples revealed
major NOS1AP proteins with apparent molecular masses of 75 kD and 30 kD.
Other minor bands were detected and may represent variably
phosphorylated forms.

GENE STRUCTURE

Xu et al. (2005) determined that the NOS1AP gene contains 10 exons.
NOS1AP-S contains only exons 9 and 10 and has much longer 5-prime and
3-prime UTRs than NOS1AP-L.

MAPPING

Seki et al. (1997) mapped the NOS1AP gene, which they called KIAA0464,
to chromosome 1 by radiation hybrid analysis.

GENE FUNCTION

Jaffrey et al. (1998) showed that CAPON and NOS1 interacted in vivo and
in vitro and colocalized in rat brain. The 125-amino acid C-terminal
fragment of CAPON specifically interacted with NOS1 in a 2-hybrid
system. CAPON was found to compete with PSD95 (602887) for interaction
with NOS1, and overexpression of CAPON resulted in a loss of PSD95-NOS1
complexes in transfected cells. Jaffrey et al. (1998) concluded that
CAPON may influence NOS1 by regulating its ability to associate with
PSD95-NMDA receptor complexes. They proposed a model of PSD95-NOS1
regulation by CAPON in which NMDA receptors are coupled to NOS1 through
a PSD95 multimer; these interactions are mediated by PDZ domains. In
this complex, NOS1 is situated close to NMDA receptor-modulated calcium
influx. Binding of CAPON results in the reduction of NMDA
receptor-PSD95-NOS1 complexes, leading to a decreased access to NMDA
receptor-gated calcium influx and a catalytically inactive enzyme.

Chang et al. (2008) found that Capon was expressed in guinea pig heart
and interacted with Nos1 to accelerate cardiac repolarization by
inhibiting L-type calcium channels (see CACNA1C; 114205).

Carrel et al. (2009) found that overexpression of human NOS1AP-L in
cultured rat hippocampal neurons significantly reduced primary and
secondary dendrite numbers. Conversely, downregulation of Nos1ap-l via
short hairpin RNA increased primary and secondary dendrite numbers.
Mutation analysis showed that a middle region of NOS1AP played an
essential role in mediating NOS1AP-L action. Yeast 2-hybrid analysis of
rat brain lysates showed that this domain bound Cpe (114855), and the
interaction of NOS1AP-L with Cpe was confirmed by immunoprecipitation
analysis and protein pull-down assays. Knockdown of Cpe in hippocampal
neurons abrogated the effect of NOS1AP-L overexpression, although
knockdown of Cpe alone had little effect on dendrite branching.
Overexpression of human NOS1AP-S also inhibited dendrite branching, but
only when it was overexpressed in young cultures. NOS1AP-S also lacks
the CPE-binding domain of NOS1AP-L, suggesting that it inhibits dendrite
branching through a different mechanism.

;;OTF, LYMPHOID-SPECIFIC, 2; OTF2;;
OCTAMER-BINDING TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 2; OCT2
DESCRIPTION An understanding of development necessitates an understanding of the
molecular mechanisms of cell type-specific gene expression. Using
synthetic promoter constructions, it has been found that 2 sequences
within immunoglobulin promoters are sufficient for lymphoid-specific
promoter activity: an octamer, ATTTGCAT, and a TATA box. Staudt et al.
(1988) isolated a cDNA which hybridized with mRNA transcripts that were
largely restricted to lymphoid cells. The level of expression of the
gene, termed OCT2, within different lymphoid cell lines correlated well
with the amount of a nuclear factor called NFA2 that had previously been
detected only in lymphoid cells. Ko et al. (1988) determined the DNA
sequence of the OCT2 cDNA and showed that its gene product contains a
homeobox. Site-directed mutagenesis of the homeobox domain abolished DNA
binding. They demonstrated, furthermore, that the gene is located on
chromosome 19, using hybridization to a panel of somatic cell hybrid
DNAs. By linkage studies in an interspecific backcross and by studies of
recombinant inbred strains, Siracusa et al. (1991) assigned the Otf2
gene to mouse chromosome 7. Whereas the Otf1 and Otf2 molecular probes
recognize single loci, members of the Otf3 family map to mouse
chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 6, 14, 17, and the X chromosome.

Deans et al. (1996) identified the neuronal NOS gene (163731) as a
target of OCT2 transcriptional activation in neuronal cells.

Schubart et al. (2001) noted that Oct2-deficient mice die at birth but
have normal B-cell development and transcription of immunoglobulin (Ig)
genes. Oct-binding factor-1 (Obf1; 601206)-deficient mice are viable
with unaffected B-cell development in bone marrow and normal serum IgM
but have reduced B-cell numbers in spleen and low serum IgG. By creating
double knockout mice, Schubart et al. (2001) confirmed that B-cell
development and Ig gene transcription can proceed normally without these
B-cell specific factors. However, in these animals the mature B-cell
pool was strongly reduced, suggesting that these factors play an

605515	TITLE *605515 FORKHEAD BOX P1; FOXP1
;;GLUTAMINE-RICH FACTOR 1; QRF1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

FOXP1 is a transcriptional repressor that plays a critical role in
monocyte differentiation and macrophage function (Shi et al., 2008).

CLONING

Li and Tucker (1993) cloned a glutamine-rich factor, which they
designated QRF1, that was expressed preferentially at the terminal
differentiation stage of B cells and in skeletal muscle. The deduced
707-amino acid QRF1 protein contains an 84-amino acid segment that shows
significant sequence homology with the DNA-binding domains of the
hepatocyte nuclear factor-3/forkhead (see FOXA1; 602294) family of
proteins.

By expression cloning using blood and testis cDNA libraries to identify
the target of a monoclonal antibody (JC12), Banham et al. (2001)
obtained a full-length cDNA encoding FOXP1. The predicted 677-amino acid
protein contains coiled-coil, glutamine-rich, and serine/threonine-rich
domains in its N-terminal half; a central zinc finger domain; and
coiled-coil, serine/threonine/proline-rich, winged helix, and acidic
domains in its C-terminal half. FOXP1 also has numerous putative
phosphorylation sites, 2 nuclear localization signals (NLSs) in its
C-terminal half, and 2 PEST motif in its C-terminal acidic region.
Multiple-tissue array analysis showed ubiquitous expression of FOXP1 in
normal adult and fetal tissues, with highest expression in lymphoid and
gastrointestinal tissues. Immunohistochemistry showed that FOXP1 protein
was widely expressed, with a predominantly nuclear localization, in
normal tissues.

Wang et al. (2003) stated that there are 4 splice variants of mouse
Foxp1, designated Foxp1a through Foxp1d. They identified and cloned
Foxp1d, which encodes a Foxp1 isoform lacking the N-terminal
polyglutamine domain found in Foxp1a and Foxp1b. Northern blot analysis
and RNase protection assays showed tissue-specific expression of all 4
variants in mouse. Northern blot analysis of human tissues detected
tissue-specific expression of FOXP1 variants, with highest levels in
peripheral blood lymphocytes and in caudate nucleus of brain. Western
blot analysis detected variable expression of Foxp1a, Foxp1c, and Foxp1d
in mouse tissues, with high expression of all 3 isoforms in lung.

GENE FUNCTION

Wang et al. (2003) found that mouse Foxp1a, Foxp1c, Foxp1d, and the
related Foxp2 (605317) protein bound a 7-nucleotide core sequence,
TATTT(G/A)T. These Foxp proteins repressed gene transcription via
binding to this consensus site, which was identified within the SV40 and
IL2 (147680) promoters. In some cases, the strength of Foxp1 repression
was mediated by the polyglutamine domain. Mouse Foxp1 proteins also
formed homodimers or heterodimers with subfamily members, and the
conserved C2H2 zinc finger and leucine zipper motifs mediated
dimerization.

Using genetic manipulations, Rousso et al. (2008) demonstrated that
Foxp1 established the pattern of LIM-homeodomain protein (see 601999)
expression in embryonic mice and, accordingly, organized motor axon
projections, their connectivity with peripheral targets, and the
establishment of motor pools. Hox proteins (see 142950) dictated the
pattern of Foxp1 expression in spinal cord, and both Foxp1 and Hox were
required for segment-appropriate generation of motor columns and pools
in mouse.

Shi et al. (2008) generated transgenic mice overexpressing human FOXP1
in monocyte/macrophage lineage cells. Circulating blood monocytes from
these mice had reduced expression of macrophage colony-stimulating
factor receptor (CSF1R; 164770), impaired migratory capacity, and
diminished accumulation as splenic macrophages. Macrophage functions
were globally impaired, and osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption were
attenuated. Forced overexpression of Csf1r reversed many of the
deficits, suggesting that repression of Csf1r is likely the dominant
mechanism responsible for FOXP1 effects on monocyte differentiation and
macrophage function.

- Association of FOXP1 With Cancer

By analysis of a tumor/normal tissue expression array, Banham et al.
(2001) found that expression of FOXP1 was lower in colon tumors and
higher in stomach and prostate tumors compared with matched normal
tissues. Immunohistochemical analysis showed frequent loss of
expression, increased expression, and cytoplasmic mislocalization of the
predominantly nuclear FOXP1 protein in solid tumors.

By immunohistochemical analysis of a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (BCL)
tissue microarray, Banham et al. (2005) found that untreated patients
with a high percentage of FOXP1-positive nuclei had significantly
reduced survival and earlier progression compared with FOXP1-negative
patients.

Of 275 BCLs, Haralambieva et al. (2005) found that only 5 (3
gastrointestinal, 1 thyroid, and 1 cervical lymph node) carried a
chromosomal breakpoint in the FOXP1 gene and strong nuclear FOXP1
expression. All were diffuse large BCLs rather than marginal zone BCLs.
Haralambieva et al. (2005) concluded that genetic alterations at 3p13
are associated with strong FOXP1 expression.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Banham et al. (2001) mapped the FOXP1 gene
to chromosome 3p14.1.

CYTOGENETICS

Streubel et al. (2005) noted that 3 chromosomal translocations,
t(11;18)(q21;q21), t(14;18)(q32;q21), and t(1;14)(p22;q32), are
associated with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas. They
identified a t(3;14)(p14;q32) in a case of MALT lymphoma of the thyroid.
FISH studies showed that the IGH locus (147100) was rearranged, and
long-distance inverse PCR identified FOXP1 as the partner gene on
chromosome 3. Using FISH assays to screen 91 MALT lymphomas negative for
3 common translocations, Streubel et al. (2005) identified
t(3;14)(p14;q32) in 9 cases (3 thyroid, 4 ocular adnexa, and 2 skin).
Most t(3;14)(p14;q32)-positive MALT lymphomas also harbored additional
genetic abnormalities, such as trisomy 3. All 4 of the MALT-associated
translocations were mutually exclusive. Real-time RT-PCR analysis showed
upregulated expression of FOXP1 in MALT cases with t(3;14)(p14;q32) or
trisomy 3. Streubel et al. (2005) concluded that FOXP1 is a
translocation partner of IGH in a site-dependent subset of MALT
lymphomas.

Carr et al. (2010) reported a boy with severe speech delay and delayed
motor development (see 613670) who carried a de novo heterozygous 1.0-Mb
interstitial deletion of chromosome 3p14.1 that involved only the FOXP1
gene. The phenotype was confounded by a Chiari I malformation, which was
surgically corrected at age 30 months. The patient had delayed gross
motor skills and walked at 16 months. After surgery for the Chiari
malformation, he had some improvement in motor skills. The most
significant feature was speech delay with limited verbal output and
difficulty in articulating entire words and multisyllabic speech,
although he did not have a deficit in oromotor coordination. At age 4
years, he developed staring spells with motor arrest associated with
epileptiform discharges. He had mild dysmorphic facial features,
including broad forehead, hypertelorism, downslanting palpebral
fissures, ptosis, short nose, broad nasal tip, and smooth philtrum. Carr
et al. (2010) concluded that FOXP1 may play a role in the development of
verbal and motor skills.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Hamdan et al. (2010) identified 2 different de novo heterozygous
mutations in the FOXP1 gene (605515.0001 and 605515.0002, respectively)
in 2 unrelated children of French Canadian origin with moderate mental
retardation, expressive language deficits, and autistic features
(613670). The first mutation (605515.0001) was a small deletion found
using array-based comparative genomic hybridization of a cohort of 80
patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and 30 with intellectual
disability. The second mutation (R525X; 605515.0002) was found by direct
sequencing of the FOXP1 gene in a cohort of 110 patients with
intellectual disability, 84 with ASD, and 51 with both. Hamdan et al.
(2010) chose to examine the FOXP1 gene specifically because of the role
of the FOXP2 gene (605317) in a speech and language disorder (SPCH1;
602081); patients with intellectual disability and ASD often show
language impairment. The results indicated that disruption of FOXP1 has
a global impact on brain development.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hu et al. (2006) found that mice lacking Foxp1 died at embryonic day
14.5 due to heart valve and outflow tract abnormalities. Reconstitution
of Rag2 (179616)-deficient mice with Foxp1 -/- or Foxp1 +/- fetal liver
cells resulted in decreased mature B cells, but normal thymocytes, in
the recipients. Foxp1 -/- pro-B cells had reduced IgM, Rag1 (179615),
and Rag2 expression, and V(D)J rearrangement was also impaired in Foxp1
-/- B cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and EMSA analyses showed that
Foxp1 bound to Foxp site-2 (Fkh2) in the Erag enhancer, which is
upstream of Rag2, in a B-lineage specific way. Hu et al. (2006)
concluded that FOXP1 influences B-cell development at an early stage,
and that FOXP1 deficiency results in a phenotype that resembles double
haploinsufficiency of E2A (TCF3; 147141) and EBF (164343).

Feng et al. (2010) generated mice with a conditional deletion of Foxp1
in double-positive thymocytes and found that peripheral Cd4 (see 186940)
and Cd8 (see 186910) cells also lacked Foxp1 and that single-positive
thymocytes acquired an activated phenotype in thymus. Peripheral cells
also exhibited an activated phenotype and increased apoptosis and
readily produced cytokines upon T-cell receptor engagement. Feng et al.
(2010) concluded that FOXP1 is an essential transcriptional regulator
for thymocyte development and the generation of quiescent naive T cells.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MENTAL RETARDATION WITH LANGUAGE IMPAIRMENT AND AUTISTIC FEATURES
FOXP1, 390-KB DEL

In a French Canadian girl who had mental retardation with language
impairment and autistic features (613670), Hamdan et al. (2010)
identified a de novo heterozygous 390-kb intragenic deletion in the
FOXP1 gene. The deletion encompassed exons 4 to 14 of the longest FOXP1
isoform, including the translation initiation site and leucine zipper
and zinc finger domains important for transcriptional activity.

.0002
MENTAL RETARDATION WITH LANGUAGE IMPAIRMENT AND AUTISTIC FEATURES
FOXP1, ARG525TER

In a French Canadian boy who had mental retardation with language
impairment and autistic features (613670), Hamdan et al. (2010)
identified a de novo heterozygous 1573C-T transition in the FOXP1 gene,
resulting in an arg525-to-ter (R525X) substitution. The mutation was
predicted to abolish the last 152 residues of the protein, including
part of the forkhead DNA-binding (FHD) domain and a conserved nuclear
localization signal. The mutation was not found in 570 controls. In
vitro functional expression studies in HEK293 cells showed that the
R525X mutant impaired the transcriptional repression ability of FOXP1,
consistent with a loss of function.

;;DEC205;;
GP200-MR6;;
CD205;;
CLEC13B
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Dendritic cells (DC) are highly effective antigen-presenting cells,
capturing antigens through pinocytosis or receptor-mediated endocytosis,
processing the antigens, and then loading the antigens onto MHC
molecules for presentation to T cells. These processes drive migration
and maturation of DC. Jiang et al. (1995) proposed that mouse Dec205,
which has a marked similarity to the macrophage mannose receptor (MRC1;
153618), is involved in endocytosis of antigen on dendritic cells. By
RT-PCR with degenerate primers based on the sequence of mouse Dec205,
followed by 3-prime RACE using a DC-like cell line, Kato et al. (1998)
cloned a cDNA for the human homolog of Dec205, designated lymphocyte
antigen-75 (LY75) by the HUGO Nomenclature Committee. The complete cDNA
for LY75 encodes a 1,722-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 198
kD. The LY75 protein has 77% overall amino acid identity with mouse
Dec205. LY75 is a member of the MMR family of multidomain molecules. It
contains a signal peptide, a cysteine-rich domain, a fibronectin type II
domain, 10 carbohydrate recognition-like domains, a transmembrane
domain, and a cytoplasmic tail. Northern blot analysis of hematopoietic
cell lines revealed the presence of a predominant 7.8-kb and a secondary
9.5-kb transcript in myeloid, B-cell, and Hodgkin cell lines but not in
the Jurkat T-cell line. In peripheral blood, immature DC contained
barely detectable transcripts, which increased 50-fold upon
differentiation and activation.

McKay et al. (1998) observed that a molecule that they termed GP200-MR6
appeared to have both promaturational as well as antiproliferative
actions on B lymphocytes. They cloned GP200-MR6, which is identical to
LY75. Northern blot analysis revealed expression in spleen, thymus,
colon, and peripheral blood lymphocytes and low or negative expression
in small intestine, prostate, testis, and ovary. The protein appeared to
intercept IL4-mediated growth/maturation systems, possibly mediated by
its tyrosine kinase activity.

- DEC205/DCL1 Fusion Protein

By 3-prime RACE analysis of DEC205 in a Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS)
lymphoma cell line, Kato et al. (2003) identified a cDNA encoding a
fusion of DEC205 with DCL1 (CD302; 612246). Northern blot analysis
showed that the 9.5-kb DEC205/DCL1 fusion mRNA was predominately
expressed in HRS cell lines. RT-PCR revealed that HRS cells expressed at
least 2 variant DEC205/DCL1 mRNAs, one with DEC205 exon 34 fused to DCL1
exon 2, and the other with DEC205 exon 33 fused to DCL1 exon 2. The
fusion variants appeared to be generated by cotranscription of both
DEC205 and DCL1, followed by intergenic splicing to remove DEC205 exon
35 alone or both exons 34 and 35 along with DCL1 exon 1. The resulting
ORFs encode all or most of the DEC205 ectodomain plus the DCL1
ectodomain, transmembrane domain, and cytoplasmic domain.
Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis showed that the fusion
mRNA was translated into a 180-kD DEC205/DCL1 fusion protein in HRS cell
lines.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kato et al. (2003) determined that the DEC205 gene contains 35 exons.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis and FISH, Kato et al. (1998) mapped the
LY75 gene to chromosome 2q24. By genomic sequence analysis, Kato et al.
(2003) determined that the LY75 gene is located approximately 5.4 kb
upstream of the DCL1 gene.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase, calcineurin, is involved in a
wide range of biologic activities, acting as a Ca(2+)-dependent modifier
of phosphorylation status. In testis, the motility of the sperm is
thought to be controlled by cAMP-dependent phosphorylation and a unique
form of calcineurin appears to be associated with the flagellum. The
calcineurin holoenzyme is composed of catalytic and regulatory subunits
of 60 and 18 kD, respectively. At least 3 genes, calcineurin A-alpha
(CALNA1; 114105), calcineurin A-beta (CALNA2; 114106), and calcineurin
A-gamma (CALNA3), have been cloned for the catalytic subunit. These
genes have been identified in humans, mice, and rats, and are highly
conserved between species (90 to 95% amino acid identity).

CLONING

Muramatsu and Kincaid (1992) cloned from a human testis library a cDNA
for an alternatively spliced variant of the testis-specific catalytic
subunit, calcineurin A-gamma. The nucleotide sequence encodes a protein
of 502 amino acids. The cDNA sequence differed from the murine form of
the gene by a 30-bp deletion in the coding region, the position of which
matched those in the 2 other genes for the catalytic subunit. The
findings indicated that the alternative splicing event occurred before
divergence of the 3 genes. The deduced sequence of the human protein was
only 88% identical to the homologous murine form; this indicated a more
rapid rate of evolution for the testis-specific gene.

GENE FUNCTION

Gerber et al. (2003) noted that calcineurin activity plays a key role in
the downstream regulation of dopaminergic signal transduction and in the
induction of certain forms of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-dependent
synaptic plasticity. Thus, calcineurin function could comprise a
critical link between dopaminergic and glutamatergic signaling.

MAPPING

By analysis of Southern blots containing DNA from human-hamster somatic
cell hybrids, Muramatsu and Kincaid (1992) showed that the CALNA3 gene
is located on human chromosome 8. Gerber et al. (2003) stated that the
PPP3CC gene maps to chromosome 8p21.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Gerber et al. (2003) examined genes encoding calcineurin subunits or
calcineurin-related molecules that map to schizophrenia susceptibility
loci in the human. Transmission disequilibrium studies in a large sample
of affected families suggested association of the PPP3CC gene with
schizophrenia. The PPP3CC gene maps within a confirmed schizophrenia
susceptibility locus (SCZD6; 603013).

ANIMAL MODEL

Miyakawa et al. (2003) found that mice with a conditional knockout (KO)
of calcineurin exhibited multiple abnormal behaviors related to
schizophrenia (181500). They subjected calcineurin-KO mice to a
comprehensive behavioral test battery. Mutant mice showed increased
locomotor activity, decreased social interaction, and impairments in
prepulse inhibition and latent inhibition. In addition, the mutant mice
displayed an increased response to the locomotor stimulating effects of
MK-801. Collectively, the abnormalities in the mutant mice were
considered to be strikingly similar to those described for
schizophrenia. The knockout mice in these studies had forebrain-specific
knockout.

;;GCD10, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; GCD10;;
CHROMOSOME 20 OPEN READING FRAME 155; C20ORF155
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By analysis of a BAC clone containing the MCM8 gene (608187), Johnson et
al. (2003) identified CRLS1, which they designated GCD10 due to homology
between the deduced protein and S. cerevisiae Gcd10, an RNA-binding
protein. EST analysis indicated that GCD10 has several putative start
sites and 2 alternatively spliced transcripts.

GENE STRUCTURE

Johnson et al. (2003) determined that the CRLS1 gene contains 11 exons,
spans 12.7 kb, and lies in a head-to-head orientation with the MCM8
gene. The 5-prime untranslated region, which is shared with MCM8,
contains a CpG island and a putative CCAAT element that is less than 30
bp from the GCD10 start point, but lacks TATA boxes for either gene.
There are putative binding sites for SP1 (189906), ETS1 (164720), E2F1
(189971), and PURA (600473).

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Johnson et al. (2003) mapped the CRLS1
gene to chromosome 20p13-p12.3, where it lies in a head-to-head
orientation with MCM8.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In Moroccan and Dutch control populations, Gerards et al. (2010)
identified a common 592C-T variant in the CRLS1 gene, resulting in a
pro193-to-leu (P193L) substitution. The variant was present in 20% and
10% of alleles from each cohort, respectively. Two Moroccan sibs with
complex I deficiency (252010) and Leigh syndrome (256000) due to a
homozygous mutation in the C20ORF7 gene (612360.0002) were also found to
be homozygous for the CRLS1 P193L variant. Studies of patient
fibroblasts showed a 50 to 56% decrease in CRLS1 activity compared to
controls. Although Gerards et al. (2010) concluded that the phenotype
was most likely due to the C20ORF7 mutation, they could not exclude the
possibility that the CRLS1 variant contributed to the phenotype.

;;TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN 16K; TMEM16K
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ANO10 belongs to a family of calcium-activated chloride channels (review
by Hartzell et al., 2009).

CLONING

Vermeer et al. (2010) stated that the deduced ANO10 protein contains 660
amino acids. Quantitative PCR detected ANO10 expression in all tissues
examined, with highest expression in whole adult brain, followed by
retina and heart. Within specific adult brain regions, highest
expression was detected in frontal and occipital cortices and in
cerebellum. Expression in fetal brain was lower than in adult whole
brain.

GENE STRUCTURE

Vermeer et al. (2010) determined that the ANO10 gene spans 2.7 kb and
contains 13 exons, 12 of which are coding.

MAPPING

Vermeer et al. (2010) stated that the ANO10 gene maps to chromosome
3p22.3-p21.32. Gross (2011) mapped the ANO10 gene to chromosome 3p22.1
based on an alignment of the ANO10 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK096302)
with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 3 unrelated families with autosomal recessive
spinocerebellar ataxia-10 (SCAR10; 613728), Vermeer et al. (2010)
identified homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the ANO10
gene (613726.0001-613726.0004). The neurodegenerative disorder was
characterized by onset in the teenage or young adult years of gait and
limb ataxia, dysarthria, and nystagmus associated with marked cerebellar
atrophy on brain imaging.

;;CD200R;;
MOX2 RECEPTOR; MOX2R;;
OX2 RECEPTOR; OX2R
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CD200R, or OX2R, is a myeloid cell-specific surface glycoprotein that
interacts with OX2 (MOX2; 155970).

CLONING

Using immunoprecipitation of rat splenic lysates, followed by 5-prime
and 3-prime RACE and PCR, Wright et al. (2000) obtained cDNAs encoding
mouse and rat Ox2r. Like Ox2, Ox2r contains 2 immunoglobulin (Ig)
superfamily domains (V and C2 sets) and a single transmembrane region.
However, the 67-amino acid cytoplasmic domain of Ox2r is larger than
that of Ox2, and it contains 3 conserved tyrosine residues, 1 of which
is within an NPXY motif. NPXY motifs bind the PTB/PID domains present in
signaling adaptor molecules such as SHC (600560), IRS1 (147545), and
NUMB (603728), suggesting that Ox2r engagement by Ox2 may lead to
intracellular signals affecting macrophage function. The rodent Ox2r
proteins have at least 8 potential N-linked glycosylation sites.
Pervanadate treatment indicated that Ox2r can be phosphorylated on
tyrosine residues. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated Ox2r expression
on rat macrophages and dendritic cells, but not on lymphocytes.

By searching EST databases for homologs of rat Cd200r, followed by PCR
of a lung cDNA library, Wright et al. (2003) cloned human CD200R. The
deduced 325-amino acid type I cell surface glycoprotein contains a
leader peptide, 2 Ig-like domains in the V/C2 arrangement, a hydrophobic
transmembrane sequence, and a substantial cytoplasmic region. All
extracellular cysteines, 8 N-glycosylation sites, and 3 tyrosine
phosphorylation sites are conserved with rat Cd200r. Wright et al.
(2003) also cloned a CD200R splice variant that encodes a protein with
23 additional amino acids in the N-terminal leader peptide. RT-PCR
analysis detected strongest CD200R expression in bone marrow, followed
by lymph node, spleen, and lung. In cell lines, highest expression was
in dendritic cells, followed by Th2 cells and mast cells. Flow
cytometric analysis revealed highest expression in peripheral blood T
cells, neutrophils, and basophils, with moderate levels in monocytes and
low levels in natural killer and B cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Functional analysis by Wright et al. (2000) showed that rat Ox2r
expressed in a human kidney epithelium cell line bound Ox2. Using the
experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE) model in rats, they showed that
blocking the Ox2-Ox2r interaction augmented the severity but not the
duration of EAE disease.

Dick et al. (2001) used FACS and immunohistochemical analyses to show
that Ox2 was expressed in normal rat myeloid-derived retinal cells,
while both Ox2 and Ox2r were expressed in inflamed retinal tissue during
experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis.

Using biacore analysis, Wright et al. (2003) showed that human CD200R
interacts with CD200.

By flow cytometry and immunohistochemical analysis, Cherwinski et al.
(2005) found that CD200R was expressed on human and murine mast cells.
Engagement of CD200R by CD200 resulted in potent inhibition of mast cell
degranulation and cytokine secretion. Cherwinski et al. (2005) noted
that CD200R does not contain an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory
motif (ITIM) and thus represents a novel receptor that can be targeted
in vivo to regulate mast cell-dependent pathologies.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Wright et al. (2003) mapped CD200, CD200R,
and a closely related gene, CD200RL, to chromosome 3. The CD200RL gene
appeared to be nonfunctional in humans.

;;LEUCINE-RICH REPEAT-CONTAINING PROTEIN 5; LRRC5
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching protein and nucleotide databases for sequences similar to
LRRC8 (LRRC8A; 608360), followed by RT-PCR of peripheral blood
mononuclear cell and monocyte total RNA, Kubota et al. (2004) identified
LRRC8D as LRRC5. The deduced 858-amino acid protein contains 4
N-terminal transmembrane domains and 16 C-terminal leucine-rich repeats.
LRRC8D shares 55% identity with LRRC8A and 95% identity with the
859-amino acid mouse ortholog. Semiquantitative PCR detected variable
LRRC8D expression in all tissues examined except skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Kubota et al. (2004) found that expression of LRRC8D in isolated human
peripheral blood mononuclear cells or monocytes was increased following
exposure to phytohemagglutinin, phorbol ester, or lipopolysaccharide.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Kubota et al. (2004) mapped the LRRC8D
gene to chromosome 1p22.2. They mapped the mouse Lrrc8d gene to
chromosome 5.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching EST databases for sequences near the region of chromosome 7
deleted in Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS; 194050), Micale et al. (2008)
identified and cloned TRIM74. The deduced 250-amino acid protein
contains a RING finger domain, a B-box type-2 domain, and a coiled-coil
region. TRIM74 is 94% identical to the N-terminal 250 amino acids of
TRIM50 (612548) and 99.6% identical to TRIM73 (612549).

GENE STRUCTURE

Micale et al. (2008) determined that the TRIM74 gene contains 5 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Micale et al. (2008) mapped the TRIM74
gene to chromosome 7q11.23, centromeric to the interval deleted in WBS.

EVOLUTION

Micale et al. (2008) determined that the TRIM73 and TRIM74 genes
resulted from duplication of a region of chromosome 7q11.23 containing
the TRIM50 gene. The mouse genome contains Trim50, but it lacks Trim73
and Trim74 due to an absence of the Trim50 duplication.

;;RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN, MITOCHONDRIAL, S12; RPMS12;;
RPSM12
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Ribosomal protein S12, a homolog of the E. coli rpsL gene product, is a
core component of the highly conserved ribosomal accuracy center. To
characterize human nuclear genes encoding components of the
mitochondrial gene expression machinery, Shah et al. (1998) searched an
expressed sequence tag (EST) database with the amino acid sequence of E.
coli rpsL. They isolated over 30 ESTs comprising a single contig in both
human and mouse, and they stated that this indicates RPMS12 is likely a
single-copy gene in the genomes of these mammals. The RPMS12 protein has
an N-terminal extension containing basic and hydroxyl-group amino acids,
consistent with a role for RPMS12 in mitochondrial targeting.

Johnson et al. (1998) cloned the gene encoding human mitochondrial
ribosomal protein S12 based on its homology to the Drosophila tko gene.
They found that the gene stretches over 1.7 kb of genomic DNA. The mRNA
showed 3 distinct patterns of splicing within the 5-prime untranslated
region, with 1 form predominant over the other 2, in all human tissues
examined. The coding region of the leader sequence is interrupted in
codon 17 by a second intron of 990 bp. The predicted protein is
translated as a prepeptide of 138 amino acids and processed to a peptide
of 112 amino acids with a molecular mass of 12.3 kD. The authors pointed
out that the functional role of RPMS12 makes it a candidate gene for
susceptibility to aminoglycoside ototoxicity (580000), which in some
cases is demonstrably due to mutation in the mitochondrial gene encoding
mitochondrial ribosomal RNA 12S, MTRNR1 (561000).

MAPPING

Using a radiation hybrid mapping panel, Johnson et al. (1998) localized
the RPMS12 gene to 19q13, near marker D19S881. They noted that the map
location of the gene made it a candidate for the autosomal dominant
deafness gene DFNA4 (600652).

By somatic cell hybrid analysis and radiation hybrid mapping, Shah et
al. (1998) mapped the human RPMS12 gene to 19q13.1.

DESCRIPTION By screening a human fetal brain cDNA library, Meng et al. (2002)
identified DTD1. The deduced 209-amino acid protein has a predicted
molecular mass of 23.4 kD and contains potential sites for
phosphorylation and O-glycosylation. DTD1 shares 94% identity with its
mouse ortholog. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.5-kb transcript in
human fetal brain. PCR analysis of human tissues detected high
expression in adult brain, testis, ovary, spleen, and fetal brain, and
moderate expression in adult colon, thymus, and small intestine and
fetal liver, lung, thymus, spleen, heart, and kidney.

;;PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 1 NUCLEAR TARGETING SUBUNIT; PNUTS;;
PP1 NUCLEAR TARGETING SUBUNIT
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) is a serine/threonine phosphatase that
exerts control over many aspects of cellular physiology by reversing the
actions of protein kinases. The activity of its catalytic subunit (e.g.,
PPP1CA; 176875) is thought to be directed by interaction with a family
of regulatory proteins. PPP1R10 belongs to a subfamily of PP1 regulatory
proteins, referred to as targeting subunits, that may target PP1 to
specific subcellular locations and modulate its activity toward specific
substrates at these sites (summary by Allen et al., 1998).

CLONING

Totaro et al. (1996) isolated a partial cDNA corresponding to a novel
gene, PPP1R10, located within the HLA class I region at chromosome
6p21.3. By screening human fetal brain and colon carcinoma cell line
(CaCo2) cDNA libraries with this partial cDNA, Totaro et al. (1998)
cloned cDNAs representing the full-length transcript of PPP1R10, which
they named FB19. Northern blot analysis showed that PPP1R10 was widely
expressed as a 4.5-kb transcript. The deduced 940-amino acid PPP1R10
protein contains a glycine-rich region.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen to identify proteins that interact with
the alpha isoform of Pp1 (Ppp1ca), Allen et al. (1998) cloned rat cDNAs
encoding Ppp1r10, which they called Pnuts. Pnuts exhibited a discrete
nuclear compartmentalization and colocalized with chromatin at distinct
phases during mitosis. Western blot analysis of human cell line extracts
using antibodies against Pnuts detected an approximately 120-kD protein.

Lee et al. (2010) reported that the PPP1R10 protein contains a
transcription elongation factor S II (TCEA1; 601425) N-terminal (TFS2N)
domain, a consensus RVxF motif for binding PP1, and a C-terminal zinc
finger motif.

GENE FUNCTION

Allen et al. (1998) showed that rat Pnuts formed a stable complex with
Pp1 in mammalian cell lysates and modulated Pp1 catalytic activity
toward exogenous substrate in vitro. They concluded that PNUTS is a
targeting subunit for the regulation of nuclear PP1 function.

By immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometric analysis of PP1 complexes
in HEK293 cells, Lee et al. (2010) identified a complex containing
PNUTS, TOX4 (614032), WDR82 (611059), and any 1 of the 3 PP1 catalytic
subunits, PP1-alpha, PP1-beta (PPP1CB; 600590), or PP1-gamma (PPP1CC;
176914). The complex, which they called PTW/PP1, had an apparent
molecular mass of about 200 kD, suggesting that it contains 1 molecule
of each subunit. Analysis of individual interactions revealed that mouse
Pnuts directly bound human TOX4, WDR82, and PP1, and no direct
interactions were observed between TOX4, WDR82, and PP1. Mutation
analysis of mouse Pnuts revealed that its TFS2N domain, RVxF motif, and
a central domain interacted with human TOX4, PP1, and WDR82,
respectively. The PTW/PP1 complex efficiently dephosphorylated the
isolated C-terminal domain of the large subunit of mouse RNA polymerase
II (POLR2A; 180660) in vitro. The PTW/PP1 complex was stable throughout
the cell cycle in HEK293 cells, but its association with chromatin was
regulated. PTW/PP1 associated with chromatin during interphase, was
excluded from condensed chromosomes during early mitosis, and was
reloaded onto chromosomes at late telophase. Expression of a PP1
interaction-defective mutant of mouse Pnuts or knockdown of PNUTS via
small interfering RNA in HEK293 cells disrupted the PTW/PP1 complex and
destabilized individual subunits, blocked cell cycle progression at
G2/M, and resulted in apoptosis. Lee et al. (2010) concluded that the
PTW/PP1 complex is essential for the transition from mitosis to
interphase, and they hypothesized that PTW/PP1 is involved in chromatin
remodeling.

In mice, Boon et al. (2013) showed that Mir34a (611172) is induced in
the aging heart and that in vivo silencing or genetic deletion of Mir34a
reduced age-associated cardiomyocyte cell death. Moreover, Mir34a
inhibition reduced cell death and fibrosis following acute myocardial
infarction and improved recovery of myocardial function.
Mechanistically, Boon et al. (2013) identified Pnuts as a novel direct
Mir34a target that reduces telomere shortening, DNA damage responses,
and cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and improves functional recovery after
acute myocardial infarction. Boon et al. (2013) concluded that their
results identified age-induced expression of MIR34A and inhibition of
its target PNUTS as a key mechanism that regulates cardiac contractile
function during aging and after acute myocardial infarction, by inducing
DNA damage responses and telomere attrition.

MAPPING

Totaro et al. (1996) determined that the PPP1R10 gene maps within the
HLA class I region at chromosome 6p21.3, approximately 70 kb centromeric
to the HLA-E gene (143010).

606480	TITLE *606480 ZINC METALLOPROTEINASE STE24; ZMPSTE24
;;STE24, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF;;
FACE1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ZMPSTE24 gene encodes a zinc metalloproteinase involved in the
processing of farnesylated proteins (Freije et al., 1999). The
significance of ZMPSTE24 in human disease stems from its role as an
enzyme necessary for the correct processing and maturation of lamin A
(LMNA; 150330), an intermediate filament component of the nuclear
envelope (Moulson et al., 2005).

CLONING

By EST database searching with the yeast Ste24 sequence, Tam et al.
(1998) identified a homologous human EST which they used to isolate a
human STE24 cDNA, symbolized ZMPSTE24, from a B-cell library. Freije et
al. (1999) independently identified ZMPSTE24, which they called FACE1,
by EST database searching for sequences with similarity to yeast AFC1, a
protein essential for the proteolytic processing of yeast
farnesylated/prenylated proteins. ZMPSTE24 encodes a deduced 475-amino
acid protein that shares 36% sequence identity with S. cerevisiae Ste24.
ZMPSTE24 contains a characteristic HEXXH zinc metalloprotease motif,
several transmembrane regions, and regions I, II, and III that are
conserved among a subfamily of zinc metalloproteases. Freije et al.
(1999) identified regions of high hydrophobicity, consistent with
ZMPSTE24 being a polytopic integral membrane protein and concluded that
it is a metalloprotease potentially involved in the processing of
farnesylated proteins in human tissues. Using an in vitro translation
product for SDS-PAGE analysis, Freije et al. (1999) detected a 55-kD
ZMPSTE24 protein. By Northern blot analysis, they detected ubiquitous
expression of a 3.5-kb ZMPSTE24 transcript.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis and FISH, Freije et al. (1999) mapped the
ZMPSTE24 gene to chromosome 1p34.

GENE FUNCTION

Tam et al. (1998) found that Ste24 in S. cerevisiae participates in both
amino- and carboxy-terminal processing steps during maturation of the
mating pheromone a-factor. They demonstrated that human ZMPSTE24 can
complement the mating defect of the yeast Ste24/Rce1 double mutant
strain. They concluded that, like yeast Ste24, human ZMPSTE24 can
mediate multiple types of proteolytic events.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 (see 609423) protease inhibitors
(PIs) targeting the viral aspartyl protease are a cornerstone of
treatment for HIV infection and disease, but they are associated with
lipodystrophy and other side effects. Coffinier et al. (2007) found that
treatment of human and mouse fibroblasts with HIV-PIs caused an
accumulation of prelamin A (150330). The prelamin A in HIV-PI-treated
fibroblasts migrated more rapidly than nonfarnesylated prelamin A,
comigrating with the farnesylated form found in ZMPSTE24-deficient
fibroblasts. HIV-PI-treated heterozygous ZMPSTE24 fibroblasts exhibited
an exaggerated accumulation of farnesyl-prelamin A. Western blot and
enzymatic analysis showed that HIV-PIs inhibited ZMPSTE24 activity and
endoproteolytic processing of a GFP-prelamin A fusion protein, but they
did not affect farnesylation of HDJ2 (DNAJA1; 602837) or activity of
farnesyltransferase (see 134635), ICMT (605851), and RCE1 (605385) in
vitro. Coffinier et al. (2007) concluded that HIV-PIs inhibit ZMPSTE24,
leading to an accumulation of farnesyl-prelamin A, possibly explaining
HIV-PI side effects.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Quigley et al. (2013) reported the crystal structure of human ZMPSTE24
at 3.4-angstrom resolution. ZMPSTE24 has a 7-transmembrane alpha-helical
barrel structure, surrounding a large water-filled intramembrane
chamber, capped by a zinc metalloprotease domain with the catalytic site
facing into the chamber. The 3.8-angstrom structure of a complex with a
CSIM (cys-ser-ile-met) tetrapeptide from the C terminus of prelamin A
(see 150330) showed that the mode of binding of the substrate resembles
that of an insect metalloprotease inhibitor in thermolysin.
Laminopathy-associated mutations predicted to reduce ZMPSTE24 activity
map to the zinc metalloprotease peptide-binding site (e.g., W340R,
606480.0002 and P248L, 606480.0005) or to the bottom of the chamber.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Mandibuloacral Dysplasia With Type B Lipodystrophy

Mandibuloacral dysplasia is a rare, genetically and phenotypically
heterogeneous, autosomal recessive disorder characterized by skeletal
abnormalities including hypoplasia of the mandible and clavicles,
acroosteolysis, cutaneous atrophy, and lipodystrophy (608612). Based on
phenotypic and biochemical similarities with Zmpste24 -/- mice (Pendas
et al., 2002), Agarwal et al. (2003) considered ZMPSTE24 as a candidate
gene for patients with MAD who carried no mutations in the LMNA (150330)
gene. The authors demonstrated compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations
in the ZMPSTE24 gene (606480.0001-606480.0002) in 1 of 4 MAD patients.
ZMPSTE24 is involved in posttranslational proteolytic cleavage of
carboxy terminal residues of farnesylated prelamin A to form mature
lamin A. Based on the phenotype of Zmpste24 -/- mice and complementation
studies in mutant yeast strains, the authors concluded that mutations in
ZMPSTE24 may cause MAD by affecting prelamin A processing.

Ahmad et al. (2010) reported 2 brothers with early-onset MAD in whom
they identified compound heterozygosity for a missense (606480.0005) and
a nonsense (606480.0009) mutation in the ZMPSTE24 gene.

- Lethal Restrictive Dermopathy

In 7 patients with restrictive dermopathy (275210), a lethal
genodermatosis in which tautness of the skin causes fetal akinesia or
hypokinesia deformation sequence, Navarro et al. (2004) identified a
heterozygous 1-bp insertion resulting in a premature stop codon in the
ZMPSTE24 gene (1085dupT; 606480.0001). This gene encodes a
metalloproteinase specifically involved in the posttranslational
processing of lamin A precursor. In all patients carrying a ZMPSTE24
mutation, loss of expression of lamin A as well as abnormal patterns of
nuclear sizes and shapes and mislocalization of lamin-associated
proteins was seen. Two of 9 fetuses with restrictive dermopathy carried
heterozygous splicing mutations in the LMNA gene, resulting in the
complete or partial loss of exon 11 (150330.0036 and 150330.0022,
respectively). Navarro et al. (2004) concluded that a common
pathogenetic pathway, involving defects of the nuclear lamina and
matrix, is involved in restrictive dermopathy.

Navarro et al. (2005) described 7 previously reported patients and 3 new
patients with restrictive dermopathy who were homozygous or compound
heterozygous for ZMPSTE24 mutations. In all cases there was complete
absence of both ZMPSTE24 and mature lamin A, associated with prelamin A
accumulation. The authors concluded that restrictive dermopathy is
either a primary or a secondary laminopathy, caused by dominant de novo
LMNA mutations or, more frequently, recessive null ZMPSTE24 mutations.
The accumulation of truncated or normal length prelamin A is, therefore,
a shared pathophysiologic feature in recessive and dominant restrictive
dermopathy.

Moulson et al. (2005) identified homozygous or compound heterozygous
mutations in the ZMPSTE24 gene (606480.0001; 606480.0007; 606480.0008)
in patients with lethal restrictive dermopathy. All the mutations
resulted in premature termination and lack of a functional protein.
Cultured cells and tissue from affected individuals showed accumulation
of unprocessed toxic lamin A and aggregates of lamin A in nuclei,
suggesting that the disorder results from defective processing of lamin
A.

In a female infant with lethal restrictive dermopathy, who was negative
for mutation in LMNA, Chen et al. (2009) identified homozygosity for a
nonsense mutation in the ZMPSTE24 gene (606480.0006).

In a Polish infant who died of restrictive dermopathy at 12 days of
life, Smigiel et al. (2010) identified compound heterozygosity for 2
inactivating mutations in the ZMPSTE24 gene (606480.0010 and
606480.0011).

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Denecke et al. (2006) described a patient considered to have
Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS; 176670), which is usually
caused by a heterozygous mutation in LMNA gene (150330), which codes for
the nuclear lamina protein lamin A, and was found to have a combined
defect of a homozygous loss-of-function mutation in the ZMPSTE24 gene
and a heterozygous mutation in the LMNA gene that resulted in a
C-terminal elongation of the final lamin A. Whereas a loss-of-function
mutation of ZMPSTE24 normally results in lethal restrictive
dermatopathy, the truncation of LMNA seems to have been a salvage
alteration alleviating the clinical picture to the HGPS phenotype in
this patient. The mutations in this patient indicated that farnesylated
prelamin A is the deleterious agent leading to the HGPS phenotype, thus
giving further insight into the pathophysiology of that disorder.

ANIMAL MODEL

Pendas et al. (2002) reported that disruption of the Zmpste24 gene
caused severe growth retardation and premature death in homozygous-null
mice. Histopathologic analysis of the mutant mice showed several
abnormalities, including dilated cardiomyopathy, muscular dystrophy, and
lipodystrophy. These alterations were similar to those developed by mice
deficient in A-lamin (LMNA; 150330), a major component of the nuclear
lamina, and phenocopied most defects observed in humans with diverse
congenital laminopathies, such as autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss
muscular dystrophy (181350), autosomal dominant dilated cardiomyopathy
with conduction defects (115200), and familial partial lipodystrophy of
the Dunnigan type (151660). In agreement with this finding,
Zmpste24-null mice are defective in the proteolytic processing of
prelamin A. This deficiency in prelamin A maturation leads to the
generation of abnormalities in nuclear architecture that probably
underlie the many phenotypes observed in both mice and humans with
mutations in the lamin A gene. These results indicated that prelamin A
is a specific substrate for Zmpste24 and demonstrated the usefulness of
genetic approaches for identifying the in vivo substrates of proteolytic
enzymes.

Bergo et al. (2002) studied Zmpste24 -/- mice and showed that they
gained weight slowly, appeared malnourished, and exhibited progressive
hair loss. A more striking pathologic phenotype was multiple spontaneous
bone fractures, akin to those occurring in mouse models of osteogenesis
imperfecta. Cortical and trabecular bone volumes were significantly
reduced. They also manifested muscle weakness in the limbs, resembling
mice lacking the farnesylated CAAX protein prelamin A. Prelamin A
processing was defective both in fibroblasts lacking Zmpste24 and in
fibroblasts lacking the CAAX carboxylmethyltransferase Icmt (605851),
but was normal in fibroblasts lacking the CAAX endoprotease Rce1
(605385). Weakness in the null mice could be reasonably ascribed to a
defective processing of prelamin A, but the brittle bone phenotype
suggested a broader role for Zmpste24 in mammalian biology.

In Zmpste24-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), Liu et al.
(2005) observed increased DNA damage, chromosomal aberrations, and
sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents. Recruitment of p53-binding protein-1
(TP53BP1; 605230) and Rad51 (179617) to sites of DNA lesion was impaired
in Zmpste24-null MEFs and in Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome
(176670) fibroblasts, resulting in a delayed checkpoint response and
defective DNA repair; wildtype MEFs ectopically expressing unprocessible
prelamin A showed similar defects in checkpoint response and DNA repair.
Liu et al. (2005) concluded that unprocessed prelamin A and truncated
lamin A act in a dominant-negative fashion to perturb DNA damage
response and repair, resulting in genomic instability which might
contribute to laminopathy-based premature aging.

Varela et al. (2005) analyzed the transcriptional alterations occurring
in tissues from Zmpste24-deficient mice and demonstrated that Zmpste24
deficiency elicits a stress signaling pathway that is evidenced by a
marked upregulation of p53 (191170) target genes, and accompanied by a
senescence phenotype at the cellular level and accelerated aging at the
organismal level. These phenotypes are largely rescued in
Zmpste24-null/Lmna (150330) heterozygous mice and partially reversed in
Zmpste24-null/p53-null mice. Varela et al. (2005) concluded that their
findings provided evidence for the existence of a checkpoint response
activated by the nuclear abnormalities caused by prelamin-A
accumulation, and supported the concept that hyperactivation of the
tumor suppressor p53 may cause accelerated aging.

In progeria, the accumulation of farnesyl-prelamin A disrupts the
structural scaffolding for the cell nucleus, leading to misshapen
nuclei. Previous studies (e.g., Mallampalli et al., 2005) had shown that
farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) reverse this cellular abnormality.
Fong et al. (2006) tested the efficacy of an FTI (ABT-100) in
Zmpste24-deficient mice, a mouse model of progeria. The FTI-treated mice
exhibited improved body weight, grip strength, bone integrity, and
percent survival at 20 weeks of age. Fong et al. (2006) concluded that
FTIs may have beneficial effects in humans with progeria.

Varela et al. (2008) found that combined treatment of Zmpste24-null mice
with statins and aminobisphosphonates resulted in amelioration of the
aging-like phenotype, with increased amounts of subcutaneous fat,
reduced kyphosis, alopecia, and osteoporosis, and extended life span.
The mechanism of treatment involved the inhibition of farnesyl
pyrophosphate synthesis and prevention of cross-prenylation of prelamin
A. This resulted in improved nuclear morphology and decreased
accumulation of prelamin A. This treatment failed to extend the life
span of Lmna-null mice.

Ibrahim et al. (2013) identified a hypomorphic allele of the
isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase (ICMT; 605851) gene that
increased body weight, normalized grip strength, and prevented bone
fractures and death in Zmpste24-deficient mice. The reduced Icmt
activity caused prelamin A mislocalization within the nucleus and
triggered prelamin A-dependent activation of Akt (164730)-mTOR (601231)
signaling, which abolished the premature senescence of
Zmpste24-deficient fibroblasts. Icmt inhibition increased Akt-mTOR
signaling and proliferation and delayed senescence in human
Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome fibroblasts, but did not reduce the
levels of misshapen nuclei in mouse and human cells. Ibrahim et al.
(2013) suggested that targeting ICMT might be useful for treating
prelamin A-associated progeroid disorders.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MANDIBULOACRAL DYSPLASIA WITH TYPE B LIPODYSTROPHY
RESTRICTIVE DERMOPATHY, LETHAL, INCLUDED
ZMPSTE24, 1-BP DUP, 1085T

In a Belgian woman with mandibuloacral dysplasia, progeroid appearance,
and generalized lipodystrophy (608612), Agarwal et al. (2003) identified
compound heterozygosity for a 1-bp duplication (1085dupT) in exon 9 of
the ZMPSTE24 gene, resulting in a frameshift and a truncated protein
(phe361fsX379), and a missense mutation (606480.0002). Neither mutation
was found among 100 control subjects.

Navarro et al. (2004) identified a heterozygous 1085dupT mutation 7
unrelated infants with lethal restrictive dermopathy (275210). The
mutation was predicted to result in a frameshift and a premature stop
codon 18 codons downstream. Loss of expression of lamin A (LMNA;
150330), abnormal patterns of nuclear sizes and shapes, and
mislocalization of lamin-associated proteins was seen in fibroblasts
from these patients. Moulson et al. (2005) hypothesized that the
patients reported by Navarro et al. (2004) with heterozygous mutations
actually had a second pathogenic mutation in the ZMPSTE24 gene that was
not detected.

Moulson et al. (2005) identified a homozygous 1085dupT mutation in a
Dutch patient and in a American patient of German origin, both with
restrictive dermopathy. The Dutch patient was born of consanguineous
parents. Fibroblasts derived from a patient who was homozygous for the
mutation showed that LMNA was distributed in clusters in the nucleus,
which was different from the uniform distribution of LMNA in nuclei of
control fibroblasts. These findings indicated that the disorder results
from a specific defect in LMNA processing. Another unrelated Dutch
patient with restrictive dermopathy disorder was compound heterozygous
for 2 mutations: 1085dupT and 591dupT (606480.0008).

Li (2010) identified a homozygous 1085dupT mutation in an infant girl
with restrictive dermopathy. She was born of Mexican Mennonite parents
who had immigrated to Canada. The mother reported several neonatal
deaths in her family. Li (2010) postulated that since this family was of
Mennonite descent, it may represent a founder mutation in this group.
However, Miner (2010) noted that Moulson et al. (2005) had previously
identified a different truncating mutation in the ZMPSTE24 gene (54dupT;
606480.0007) as causing restrictive dermopathy in 2 related Mennonite
families from Pennsylvania, suggesting allelic heterogeneity even within
this isolated population.

In 2 unrelated Old Colony Mennonite infants, 1 from Alberta and 1 from
Ontario, who died shortly after birth from restrictive dermopathy,
Loucks et al. (2012) identified homozygosity for the common 1085dupT
mutation in the ZMPSTE24 gene. In addition, the mutation was found in
heterozygosity in the obligate-carrier parents of 2 unrelated deceased
Schmiedeleut Hutterite infants with restrictive dermopathy, 1 from South
Dakota and 1 from Manitoba (the latter patient was originally reported
by Reed et al., 1993). Haplotype analysis suggested a small 1.36-Mb
shared haplotype distal to the mutation. In a cohort of approximately
1,200 Schmiedeleut Hutterites from South Dakota, Loucks et al. (2012)
determined a high carrier frequency of the 1085dupT mutation
(approximately 1/21), making it likely that the mutation predates the
1874 separation of the Hutterites into the 3 current essentially
endogamous leuts and lending support to the hypothesis (Lowry et al.,
1985) that the mutation was introduced into the Hutterites in 1783 when
some Mennonites joined the Hutterite brethren. Noting that the 1085dupT
mutation accounts for nearly 75% of the reported causative ZMPSTE24
mutations in restrictive dermopathy mutations, Loucks et al. (2012)
suggested that 1085dupT may represent a recurrent mutation due to a
mutational hotspot.

MANDIBULOACRAL DYSPLASIA WITH TYPE B LIPODYSTROPHY
ZMPSTE24, TRP340ARG

In a Belgian woman with mandibuloacral dysplasia with type B
lipodystrophy (608612), Agarwal et al. (2003) found a 1018T-to-C
transition in exon 8 of the ZMPSTE24 gene, resulting in a trp340-to-arg
(W340R) amino acid substitution. This mutation was found in compound
heterozygosity with a frameshift mutation (606480.0001). The unaffected
parents and 2 sibs of the proband each were heterozygous for 1 of the
mutations.

MANDIBULOACRAL DYSPLASIA WITH TYPE B LIPODYSTROPHY
ZMPSTE24, GLN41TER

In 2 Japanese sisters with mandibuloacral dysplasia with type B
lipodystrophy (608612), Miyoshi et al. (2008) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the ZMPSTE24 gene: a 121C-T transition
in exon 1, resulting in a gln41-to-ter (Q41X) substitution, and a 743C-T
transition, resulting in a pro248-to-leu (P248L; 606480.0005)
substitution in a conserved residue adjacent to the sixth
membrane-spanning domain. Neither mutation was found in 200 Japanese
control chromosomes. In vitro functional studies in yeast showed that
the Q41X-mutant protein was inactive, but the P248L-mutant protein was
similar to wildtype. However, patient lymphocytes showed accumulation of
prelamin A, indicating ZMPSTE24 deficiency. The patients had a severe
form of the disorder with clinical features apparent before age 2 years.
The findings indicated that haploinsufficiency combined with even a
minor loss of enzyme activity in the other allele is sufficient to cause
the clinical features of MAD.

In 2 brothers, aged 9 months and 4 years, who had early-onset
mandibuloacral dysplasia with type B lipodystrophy (608612), Ahmad et
al. (2010) identified compound heterozygosity for a 743C-T transition in
exon 6 of the ZMPSTE24 gene, resulting in a pro248-to-leu (P248L)
substitution, and a 1349G-A transition in exon 10 of ZMPSTE24, resulting
in a trp450-to-ter (W450X; 606480.0009) substitution. The unaffected
parents were each heterozygous for 1 of the mutations.

In a female infant with lethal restrictive dermopathy (275210), born to
aboriginal Taiwanese parents from the same tribe but not known to be
consanguineous, Chen et al. (2009) identified homozygosity for a 715G-T
transversion in exon 6 of the ZMPSTE24 gene, resulting in a
glu239-to-ter (E239X) substitution. The unaffected parents and both
grandmothers were heterozygous for the ZMPSTE24 mutation; an unaffected
older sister did not inherit the mutation.

.0007
RESTRICTIVE DERMOPATHY, LETHAL
ZMPSTE24, 1-BP DUP, 54T (dbSNP rs137854889)

In a Mennonite infant with restrictive dermopathy (275210), Moulson et
al. (2005) identified a homozygous 1-bp duplication (54dupT) in exon 1
of the ZMPSTE24 gene, predicted to result in a frameshift and premature
termination. The parents were both heterozygous for the mutation and had
3 deceased affected children, but DNA was only available from 1 affected
child. Two additional affected sibs were reported in a related family,
and the parents and an unaffected child were heterozygous for the
mutation, but DNA was not available from the 2 deceased affected
children. The 2 families were part of an extended Mennonite kindred, as
the fathers were brothers and the mothers were first cousins of each
other. Moulson et al. (2005) noted that the Lowry et al. (1985) had
reported restrictive dermopathy in a Mennonite kindred, and suggested
that the 54dupT mutation may segregate in this population.

Li (2010) reported a different homozygous mutation (1085dupT;
606480.0001) in a Mennonite patient with restrictive dermopathy,
suggesting allelic heterogeneity in this population.

Chong et al. (2012) identified a carrier frequency for this mutation of
0.064 (1 in 15.5) among Schmiedeleut (S-leut) Hutterites in the United
States.

In a Polish infant with restrictive dermopathy who died at 12 days of

for 2 mutations in the ZMPSTE24 gene: a 1-bp deletion (50delA) in exon
1, and a 2-bp deletion (584delAT; 606480.0011) in exon 5. Each mutation
caused a frameshift predicted to result in premature termination codon,
K17SfsX21 and Y195FfsX22, respectively. No DNA was available from the
patient's older brother, who died of restrictive dermopathy at 7 days of
age; their unaffected parents were each heterozygous for one of the
mutations.

613482	TITLE *613482 CYCLIN L2; CCNL2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By randomly sequencing clones obtained from a human bone marrow stromal
cell cDNA library, followed by database analysis and PCR of a Raji
leukemia cell cDNA library, Yang et al. (2004) cloned CCNL2. The deduced
520-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 58.1 kD. CCNL2
has 2 cyclin domains and 2 putative transmembrane regions in its
N-terminal half, several arg/ser (RS) repeats in its C-terminal half,
and several nuclear localization signals. It shares 65% and 90% amino
acid identity with human CCNL1 (613384) and mouse Ccnl2, respectively.
Raji cell cDNA also contained a CCNL2 splice variant that encodes a
deduced 227-amino acid protein lacking the C-terminal RS motifs.
Northern blot analysis detected a transcript of about 5.0 kb in all
normal tissues analyzed, with highest expression in ovary, heart, liver,
and pancreas, and lower expression in spleen, colon, peripheral blood
leukocytes, lung, and skeletal muscle. RT-PCR detected CCNL2 in all
human hematopoietic cell lines and solid tumor cell lines examined.
Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that epitope-tagged CCNL2 localized
to the nucleus in transfected human hepatoma SMMC-7721 cells. CCNL2
showed both a generalized nucleoplasmic distribution and a punctate
distribution, where it colocalized in nuclear speckles with the splicing
factors SC35 (SFRS2; 600813) and 9G8 (SFRS7; 600572).

By screening a human fetal brain expression library for proteins that
bound to and were phosphorylated by the nuclear protein kinase DYRK1A
(600855), followed by database analysis, de Graaf et al. (2004)
identified 3 CCNL2 transcripts. The longest transcript, T1, is about 4.5
kb long and contains all CCNL2 exons, including the alternatively
spliced exon 6a, which introduces a stop codon. T1 encodes a truncated
CCNL2 protein lacking the RS domain of full-length CCNL2. The T2
transcript is about 2.4 kb long, lacks exon 6a, and encodes the
full-length CCNL2 protein. Transcript T3 is about 1.2 kb long, includes
an alternative polyadenylation signal in exon 6a, and lacks all further
exons. T3 and T1 encode identical truncated proteins. Using
exon-specific probes for Northern blot analysis, de Graaf et al. (2004)
found variable T1 expression in all tissues examined. T2 was
predominantly expressed in testis, and T3 was weakly expressed in almost
all tissues. PCR analysis gave similar results, with T1 and T3 highly
expressed in pancreas, and T2 highly expressed in testis.

Using Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses, Loyer et al. (2008) identified
5 distinct cyclin L2 splice variants that were variably expressed in a
tissue-dependent manner in human brain, liver, testis, spleen, and
thymus. The 5 variants have 3 distinct ORFs and encode the cyclin
L2-alpha, L2-beta-A, and L2-beta-B isoforms, which differ at their
C-terminal ends. Immunofluorescence analysis of several human cell lines
detected all cyclin L1 and L2 isoforms in both nucleoplasm and large
nuclear speckles and showed colocalization with the p110 isoform of
CDK11 (see CDK11A; 116951).

GENE FUNCTION

Using immunoprecipitation analysis, Yang et al. (2004) showed that CCNL2
interacted with the hyperphosphorylated form of RNA polymerase II (RNA
pol II; see 180660), with the p110 subunit of the cyclin-dependent
kinase PITSLRE (see 176873), and with the splicing factors SC35 and 9G8.
Mutation analysis revealed that the cyclin domains of CCNL2 associated
with RNA pol II and p110 PITSLRE, whereas the RS domain of CCNL2
associated with the splicing factors. Using HeLa cell nuclear extracts
in an in vitro splicing assay, Yang et al. (2004) showed that CCNL2
stimulated splicing activity. Overexpression of CCNL2 in SMMC-7721 cells
suppressed cell growth and induced apoptosis, which involved
upregulation of the apoptotic proteins p53 (TP53; 191170) and BAX
(600040) and downregulation of the antiapoptotic protein BCL2 (151430).
Injection of CCNL2 into SMMC-7721 tumors in nude mice inhibited tumor
growth and induced apoptotic changes.

Using FRAP analysis and live cell imaging, de Graaf et al. (2004) showed
that fluorescence-tagged CCNL2 localized transiently to nuclear speckles
in COS-7 cells. Full-length CCNL2, but not the isoform lacking the RS
domain, associated with DYRK1A in pull-down assays. CCNL2 also
interacted with DYRK2 (603496) and with p110 PITSLRE. In vitro
phosphorylation assays showed that DYRK1A phosphorylated CCNL2 on
ser330, ser338, and ser369, all of which are N-terminal to a proline
residue. De Graaf et al. (2004) concluded that CCNL2 is a highly mobile
component of nuclear speckles and that DYRK1A may regulate splicing by
phosphorylating CCNL2.

By immunoprecipitation analysis and protein pull-down assays with human
cell lines, Loyer et al. (2008) found that the alpha and beta isoforms
of cyclin L1 and L2, but not the gamma isoform of cyclin L1, interacted
with the p110 isoform of CDK11 in a high molecular mass complex that
showed splicing activity in vitro. The alpha isoforms of cyclin L1 and
L2 also interacted with the p58 and p46 isoforms of CDK11. In vivo
splicing assays showed that expression of cyclin L1-alpha, L1-beta,
L2-alpha, or L2-beta and/or p110 CDK11 increased intron-splicing
activity and altered alternative splice-site selection in a cyclin L1
and L2 isoform- and cell type-specific manner.

GENE STRUCTURE

De Graaf et al. (2004) determined that the CCNL2 gene contains at least
11 exons and spans about 13 kb. The alternatively spliced exon 6a
contains an alternative stop codon and polyadenylation site. The 3-prime
region of the CCNL2 gene contains 2 additional polyadenylation sites.

Loyer et al. (2008) stated that the CCNL2 gene contains 14 exons and
spans about 11.8 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, de Graaf et al. (2004) mapped the CCNL2
gene to chromosome 1p36.33.

Yang et al. (2004) mapped the mouse Ccnl2 gene to the low terminus of
chromosome 4.

611550	TITLE *611550 NATURAL CYTOTOXICITY TRIGGERING RECEPTOR 3; NCR3
;;1C7;;
ACTIVATING NATURAL KILLER RECEPTOR p30; NKp30;;
CD337 ANTIGEN; CD337
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs), such as NCR3, are activating
natural killer (NK) cell receptors that belong to the immunoglobulin
(Ig) superfamily. NCR3 is expressed in all resting and activated NK
cells and forms a complex with CD3-zeta (CD3Z, or CD247; 186780) (Sato
et al., 2001).

CLONING

Pende et al. (1999) generated monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and identified
one that reacted with a 30-kD integral membrane protein, NKp30, on NK
cells and cell lines. By screening an NK cell cDNA expression library,
they isolated a cDNA encoding NKp30. The deduced 190-amino acid protein
has a signal peptide followed by a 120-amino acid extracellular region
that forms a V-type Ig-like domain with 2 potential N-linked
glycosylation sites; a hydrophobic transmembrane region with a
positively charged arg residue; and a 33-amino acid cytoplasmic tail
lacking an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activating motif (ITAM).
Northern blot analysis detected a 1.0-kb transcript only in NK cells.

Using Northern blot analysis, Sivakamasundari et al. (2000) detected a
1.35-kb 1C7 transcript in human spleen, lymph node, and blood
leukocytes, with lower expression in appendix. They noted that the 3
principal IC7 splice variants differ in exon 4, and RT-PCR showed that
all 3 were expressed in human tonsil and NKL cells. However, a unique
splicing pattern was observed in human liver, including differential
usage of exon 2. Fluorescence microscopy of transfected COS-7 cells
showed cytoplasmic and perinuclear expression of IC7.
Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization revealed expression of
IC7 in tonsillar NK germinal center cells. Western blot analysis
detected IC7 protein in human tonsil, NKL cells, and brain.
Sivakamasundari et al. (2000) noted that Ic7 is a pseudogene in mouse,
but not rat.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Neville and Campbell (1999) mapped the NCR3 gene
centromeric to LST1 (LY117; 109170) and telomeric to AIF1 (601833) on
chromosome 6p21.3.

GENE FUNCTION

Pende et al. (1999) found that treatment of NK cells with anti-NKp30
inhibited natural cytotoxicity against normal target cells and most
tumor cells. Further analysis determined that NKp30 sometimes cooperated
with NKp44 (NCR2; 604531) and NKp46 (NCR1; 604530) in mediating
cytotoxicity. Western blot analysis showed that NKp30 associated with
CD3Z. Thus, NKp30 can transduce activating signals by its association
with ITAM-containing CD3Z polypeptides.

Using flow cytometric analysis, Arnon et al. (2005) showed that pp65,
the main tegument protein of human cytomegalovirus, inhibited NK cell
cytotoxicity by interacting directly and specifically with NKp30. The
interaction led to dissociation of CD3Z from NKp30 and, consequently,
reduced killing.

Using RT-PCR analysis, Mulcahy et al. (2006) detected significantly
increased expression of LST1 (109170) in blood of rheumatoid arthritis
(RA; 180300) patients and of NCR3 in blood and synovium of RA patients
compared with controls. The increased LST1 and NCR3 expression was
independent of any increase in inflammatory cells. Both genes were also
significantly upregulated in response to lipopolysaccharide, IFNG
(147570), and bacterial infection. Mulcahy et al. (2006) concluded that
LST1 and NCR3 are involved in infection, autoimmune-related
inflammation, and dendritic cell/NK cell-associated functions.

Mavoungou et al. (2007) found that NKp30- and NKp46-Ig fusion proteins
interacted with the Duffy binding-like-1-alpha (Dbl1a) domain of P.
falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein-1 on the surface of infected red
cells. The interaction was functional, leading NK cells to produce
perforin (PRF1; 170280) and granzyme B (GZMB; 123910) and to lyse
infected erythrocytes.

Using NKp30-Fc fusion proteins to screen for molecules binding NKp30 and
triggering NKp30-mediated cytolysis, followed by proteomic and mass
spectrometric analyses, Brandt et al. (2009) identified B7H6 (613714).
Using surface plasmon resonance experiments, they confirmed interaction
between B7H6 and NKp30, and interaction of the 2 proteins could be
blocked by anti-NKp30. Expression of B7H6 in a murine mastocytoma line
enabled cytotoxicity by an NKp30-expressing NK cell line and by IL2
(147680)-activated primary human NK cells.

In transfection studies of a human NK cell line, Delahaye et al. (2011)
observed functional differences between the 3 alternatively spliced exon
4 isoforms of NCR3. The 3 isoforms transmitted distinct signals: both
NCR3a and NCR3b stimulated Th1 cytokine release, including IL12 (see
161561) and gamma-interferon (IFNG; 147570), whereas NCR3a was the only
isoform that triggered cytotoxicity. These functions were consistent
with an immunostimulatory effect. In contrast, NCR3c promoted IL10
(124092) production, relaying an immunosuppressive signal through rapid
phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase (MAPK14; 600289).

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Li et al. (2011) determined the structure of NKp30 in complex with B7H6.
NKp30 uses both front and back beta sheets of its Ig-like domain to bind
B7H6, in contrast to CTLA4 (123890) and PD1 (PDCD1; 600244), which only
use the front beta sheet to bind ligands. B7H6 contacts NKp30 through
the complementarity-determining region-like loops of its V-like domain
in an antibody-like interaction not seen for B7 (CD80; 112203) or PDL
(PDCD1LG1; 605402). Li et al. (2011) proposed that the NKp30-B7H6
structure may be useful in designing molecules to stimulate
NKp30-mediated cytolytic activity for tumor immunotherapy.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Sato et al. (2001) identified SNPs in the promoter region and in exon 2
of the NCR3 gene.

A susceptibility locus for mild malaria maps to the major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) region on chromosome 6 (MALS; 609148),
and polymorphisms in TNF (191160), which is 15 kb proximal to NCR3, are
associated with mild malaria. By genotyping 10 NCR3 SNPs in a
malaria-endemic Burkina Faso population, Delahaye et al. (2007)
identified an association between mild malaria and the -412G-C
(611550.0001; dbSNP rs2736191) SNP in the NCR3 promoter. Carriers with
the -412C variant had more frequent mild malaria attacks than -412GG
individuals. NCR3 -412C and a haplotype containing -412C were
significantly associated with increased risk of mild malaria, and the
association was independent of TNF. Delahaye et al. (2007) concluded
that at least 2 centrally located MHC region genes are involved in
genetic control of malaria. They proposed that genetic variation in
NK-cell receptors may account for the heterogeneity of NK-cell
reactivity to P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes.

Delahaye et al. (2011) found an association between alternatively
spliced exon 4 isoforms of NCR3 and prognosis in gastrointestinal
stromal tumors (GIST; 606764). In a study of 44 GIST tumors,
tumor-infiltrating NK cells showed downregulation of NCR3 compared to
circulating cells of healthy volunteers. The density of the NK cell
infiltrate was inversely correlated with the presence of metastasis at
diagnosis, suggesting an NK cell-mediated immunosurveillance mechanism
in these tumors. RT-PCR studies of peripheral blood from 80 patients
with GIST showed preferential expression of the immunosuppressive NCR3c
isoform in 53%, compared to healthy volunteers, of whom only 30%
expressed isoform NCR3c (p = 0.02). NK cells from GIST patients with the
NCR3c isoform showed a defect in NCR3-driven NK effector functions. A
retrospective analysis of 80 GIST patients treated with imatinib showed
decreased overall survival in those with the NRC3c isoform compared to
those with NRC3a and NRC3b isoforms (p = 0.001). Delahaye et al. (2011)
also found an association between a 3790T-C SNP (dbSNP rs986475) in the
promoter region of the NCR3 gene, as well as other SNPs, and expression
of the NCR3c isoform. The findings suggested that the genetically
determined NCR3 status may predict clinical outcome in patients with
GIST.

By genotyping 10 NCR3 SNPs in 34 families comprising 53 parents and 140
sibs in a P. falciparum malaria-endemic region of Burkina Faso, Delahaye
et al. (2007) identified a significant association between mild malaria
(609148) and a SNP in the NCR3 promoter, a G-to-C change at position
-412 (dbSNP rs2736191) relative to the transcription start site.
Carriers with the -412C variant had more frequent mild malaria attacks
than -412GG individuals, and -412C and a haplotype containing -412C were
significantly associated with increased risk of mild malaria.

123841	TITLE *123841 PEPTIDYL-PROLYL ISOMERASE B; PPIB
;;CYCLOPHILIN B; CYPB
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cyclophilins, such as CYPB, bind the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin
A (CsA) with high affinity. CsA blocks helper T-cell activation at a
step between T-cell receptor stimulation and the transcriptional
activation of cytokine genes. Cyclophilins from many species possess
peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) activity that is blocked by
CsA and therefore may be relevant in CsA-mediated immunosuppression
(Price et al., 1991).

CLONING

Probing with the cyclophilin A (CYPA; 123840) cDNA under reduced
stringencies, Price et al. (1991) identified the CYPB gene. The deduced
protein is 64% identical to CYPA and is distinguished from it by a
signal sequence that probably directs it to the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER). CYPB shows even stronger similarity to yeast CYPB, which also has
an ER-directed signal sequence.

MAPPING

Peddada et al. (1992) used the PCR technique to generate a unique probe
complementary to the hydrophobic 5-prime end of the human cyclophilin B
gene. Using this probe in an analysis of human/hamster hybrid somatic
cell lines, they assigned the CYPB gene to chromosome 15.

GENE FUNCTION

Price et al. (1991) found that the signal sequence was removed from CYPB
upon expression in E. coli, and the processed protein possessed PPIase
activity that was inhibited by CsA.

Yurchenko et al. (2001) determined that CD147 (BSG; 109480) serves as a
receptor for CYPB. CYPB induced Ca(2+) flux, ERK (see MAPK3; 601795)
phosphorylation, and chemotaxis in CD147-transfected Chinese hamster
ovary cells, but not in control cells. The chemotactic response of
primary human neutrophils to CYPB was blocked by antibodies to CD147.

Using CsA as a bioprobe to identify cellular factors involved in
hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome replication, Watashi et al. (2005) showed
that CYPB interacts with HCV RNA polymerase NS5B to directly stimulate
its RNA binding activity. HCV replication could be reduced by RNA
interference-mediated reduction of endogenous CYPB expression or by the
induced loss of NS5B binding to CYPB. Watashi et al. (2005) concluded
that CYPB functions as a stimulatory regulator of NS5B in the HCV
replication machinery and suggested that CYPB could be a target for
antiviral therapy.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

CRTAP (605497), P3H1 (LEPRE1; 610339), and CYPB (PPIB) form an
intracellular collagen-modifying complex that 3-hydroxylates proline at
position 986 (P986) in the alpha-1 chains of collagen type I (120150),
and deficiency of CRTAP or P3H1 has been reported in autosomal recessive
lethal or severe osteogenesis imperfecta (OI; see 610682 and 610915). In
4 patients with osteogenesis imperfecta type IX (OI9; 259440) from 2
unrelated families, van Dijk et al. (2009) analyzed the PPIB gene and
identified homozygosity for a 4-bp deletion (123841.0001) and a nonsense
mutation (123841.0002), respectively. The percentage of 3-hydroxylated
P986 residues in patients with PPIB mutations was decreased in
comparison to controls, but it was higher than in patients with CRTAP or
LEPRE1 mutations. In addition, in bone tissue from patients with CRTAP
or LEPRE1 mutations, CYPB was detected but both CRTAP and P3H1 were
absent, indicating that CYPB is independent of the presence of either
CRTAP or P3H1. Van Dijk et al. (2009) suggested that recessive OI is
caused by a dysfunctional P3H1/CRTAP/CYPB complex rather than by lack of
3-prolyl hydroxylation of a single proline residue in the alpha-1 chains
of collagen type I.

In a sister and brother who had moderately severe osteogenesis
imperfecta without rhizomelia, who were born of consanguineous
Senegalese parents, Barnes et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for a
missense mutation in the PPIB gene (123841.0003). The proband had normal
collagen folding and normal prolyl 3-hydroxylation, suggesting that CYPB
is not the exclusive peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase that catalyzes
the rate-limiting step in collagen folding.

In a Palestinian pedigree segregating moderate and lethal forms of OI,
Barnes et al. (2012) identified a homozygous indel mutation in the
FKBP10 gene (607063.0009) in a proband from one branch of the family
with OI type 11 (610968), and a homozygous deletion in the PPIB gene
(123841.0004) in a proband from another branch of the family with OI
type IX (259940).

ANIMAL MODEL

Hereditary equine regional dermal asthenia (HERDA) is a degenerative
skin disease that affects the Quarter Horse breed. Tryon et al. (2007)
determined that HERDA is due to a missense mutation (gly39 to arg) in
the equine Ppib gene that alters a glycine conserved across vertebrates.
The mutation was homozygous in 64 affected horses and segregated
concordant with inbreeding loops in the genealogy of 11 affected horses.
Screening of control Quarter Horses indicated a 3.5% carrier frequency.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
OSTEOGENESIS IMPERFECTA, TYPE IX
PPIB, 4-BP DEL, 556AAGA

In 2 fetuses with osteogenesis imperfecta type IX (259440) from a
nonconsanguineous northern European family, van Dijk et al. (2009)
identified homozygosity for a 4-bp deletion (556delAAGA) in exon 5 of
the PPIB gene, resulting in a frameshift that replaces 31 highly
conserved C-terminal residues and causes a premature stop in the last
exon (Lys186GlnfsX8). The unaffected parents were heterozygous carriers
of the deletion, which was not found in 192 control alleles.

.0002
OSTEOGENESIS IMPERFECTA, TYPE IX
PPIB, GLN151TER

In 2 sibs with osteogenesis imperfecta type IX (259440) from a
consanguineous Pakistani family, van Dijk et al. (2009) identified
homozygosity for a 451C-T transition in exon 4 of the PPIB gene,
resulting in a gln151-to-ter (Q151X) substitution that removes the last
65 residues at the C terminus. The unaffected parents were heterozygous
carriers of the deletion, which was not found in 192 control alleles.

.0003
OSTEOGENESIS IMPERFECTA, TYPE IX
PPIB, MET9ARG

In a sister and brother who had moderately severe osteogenesis
imperfecta without rhizomelia (OI9; 259440), Barnes et al. (2010)
identified homozygosity for what they designated a 2T-G transversion,
predicted to eliminate the start codon of the PPIB gene. Van Dijk et al.
(2010) stated that using the current PPIB reference sequence
(NM_000942.4), this is a 26T-G transversion resulting in a met9-to-arg
(M9R) substitution, which could account for the relatively milder
phenotype. Using RT-PCR analysis, Barnes et al. (2010) found that PPIB
transcripts in the proband were approximately 55% of normal; CYPB
protein was undetectable in the proband fibroblast lysate or on
immunofluorescence staining of fibroblasts. The proband's type I
collagen showed normal modification and folding. The unaffected
consanguineous Senegalese parents were heterozygous for the mutation, as
were unaffected sibs.

OSTEOGENESIS IMPERFECTA, TYPE IX
PPIB, 4-BP DEL, 563ACAG

In a Palestinian pedigree segregating moderate and lethal forms of
recessive OI, Barnes et al. (2012) identified in one pedigree branch a
homozygous deletion in the PPIB gene (563_566delACAG) in 2 children with
lethal type IX OI; in another branch, they identified a homozygous
FKBP10 indel mutation (607063.0009) in a child with moderate type XI OI
(610968).

118661	TITLE *118661 VERSICAN; VCAN
;;CHONDROITIN SULFATE PROTEOGLYCAN 2; CSPG2;;
CHONDROITIN SULFATE PROTEOGLYCAN CORE PROTEIN, CARTILAGE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans were first identified in hyaline
cartilage, where they specifically interact with hyaluronan and form
large supramolecular complexes. Together with other matrix
glycoproteins, they provide mechanical support and a fixed negative
charge. Such molecules exist also in a variety of soft tissues where
they may play additional physiologic roles (Kjellen and Lindahl, 1991).

CLONING

Zimmermann and Ruoslahti (1989) cloned and sequenced the cDNA of the
core protein of fibroblast chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. They
designated it versican in recognition of its versatile modular
structure. Decorin (125255) and biglycan (301870) are 2 other soft
tissue proteoglycans.

Naso et al. (1995) reported that the mouse versican protein is 89%
identical to human versican and is highly expressed in mouse embryos at
days 13, 14, and 18.

Dours-Zimmermann and Zimmermann (1994) provided evidence for the
existence of 3 versican splice variants, designated V0, V1, and V2,
which differ in the length of their glycosaminoglycan attachment portion
inserted between the globular modules at the N- and C-terminal ends of
the core proteins. Versican V1 and V2 include either the GAG-alpha or
the GAG-beta domain providing attachment sites for about 5 to 8 or 12 to
15 glycosaminoglycan chains, respectively. In the V0 variant, both
GAG-alpha and GAG-beta are present. Zako et al. (1995) demonstrated the
existence of another splice variant, designated V3, which lacks a
chondroitin sulfate attachment region, the most distinctive portion of a
proteoglycan molecule.

Bode-Lesniewska et al. (1996) studied the distribution of versican by
using affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies that recognize the core
protein of the prominent versican splice variants V0 and V1. Versican
was present in the loose connective tissues of various organs and was
often associated with the elastic fiber network. It was localized in
most smooth muscle tissues and in fibrous and elastic cartilage.
Versican staining was noted in the central and peripheral nervous
system, in the basal layer of the epidermis, and on the luminal surface
of some glandular epithelia. In blood vessels, versican was present in
all 3 wall layers of veins and elastic arteries. In muscular arteries
the immunoreactivity was normally restricted to the tunica adventitia.
However, it appeared in the media and the split elastica interna of
atherosclerotically transformed vessel walls.

GENE STRUCTURE

Naso et al. (1994) showed that the human versican gene contains 15 exons
spanning more than 90 kb. One of these, exon 7, is used in an
alternative splice variant. The authors sequenced the 5-prime
promoter-containing region of the gene and found that it contained
numerous binding sites for transactivators such as AP2 (107580) and Sp1
(189906). They used transient transfection studies to show that the
promoter functioned well in both mesenchymal and epithelial cells. The
authors used deletion studies to show that this 5-prime region (to
approximately -630) contains both strong enhancer and strong negative
regulatory elements.

MAPPING

The distinctness of CSPG1 (AGC1; 155760) and CSPG2 was uncertain until
both genes had been mapped. Whereas CSPG1 is located on chromosome 15,
Iozzo et al. (1992) demonstrated that the CSPG2 gene is located on
chromosome 5. They used a combination of human/rodent somatic cell
hybrids including a panel of hybrids containing partial deletions of
chromosome 5 and narrowed the assignment to 5q12-q14, with the precise
site likely to be 5q13.2, by in situ hybridization.

Using interspecific backcross analysis, Naso et al. (1995) assigned the
Cspg2 gene to mouse chromosome 13 in a region that is syntenic with 5q.

GENE FUNCTION

To determine whether TP53 (191170) gene dosage affects transcriptional
regulation of target genes, Yoon et al. (2002) performed oligonucleotide
array gene expression analysis by using human cells with wildtype p53 or
with 1 or both TP53 alleles disrupted by homologous recombination. They
identified 35 genes, including CSPG2, whose expression was significantly
correlated to the dosage of TP53. Motif search analysis revealed that
CSPG2 contains a p53 consensus binding site in its first intron. In
vitro and in vivo assays demonstrated that CSPG2 is directly
transactivated by p53.

To understand how cancer cells infect the inflammatory microenvironment,
Kim et al. (2009) conducted a biochemical screen for
macrophage-activating factors secreted by metastatic carcinomas. They
demonstrated that, among the cell lines screened, Lewis lung carcinoma
(LLC) were the most potent macrophage activators leading to production
of interleukin-6 (IL6; 147620) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha
(TNF-alpha; 119160) through activation of the Toll-like receptor family
members TLR2 (603028) and TLR6 (605403). Both TNF-alpha and TLR2 were
found to be required for LLC metastasis. Biochemical purification of
LLC-conditioned medium led to identification of the extracellular matrix
proteoglycan versican, which is upregulated in many human tumors
including lung cancer, as a macrophage activator that acts through TLR2
and its coreceptors TLR6 and CD14 (158120). By activating TLR2:TLR6
complexes and inducing TNF-alpha secretion by myeloid cells, versican
strongly enhances LLC metastatic growth. Kim et al. (2009) concluded
that their results explained how advanced cancer cells usurp components
of the host innate immune system, including bone marrow-derived myeloid
progenitors, to generate an inflammatory microenvironment hospitable for
metastatic growth.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Wagner vitreoretinopathy (WGVRP; 143200) is an autosomal dominant
vitreoretinopathy. Miyamoto et al. (2005) demonstrated a heterozygous
A-to-G transversion at the second base of the 3-prime acceptor splice
site of intron 7 of the CSPG2 gene that cosegregated with the disease in
a Japanese family (118661.0001).

In the large 5-generation Swiss family with vitreoretinopathy originally
described by Wagner (1938), Kloeckener-Gruissem et al. (2006) identified
a heterozygous splice site mutation in intron 8 of the VCAN gene
(118661.0002) that segregated fully with disease.

In affected members of 7 Dutch families with vitreoretinopathy,
Mukhopadhyay et al. (2006) identified heterozygosity for 3 splice site
mutations in intron 7 of the VCAN gene (118661.0003-118661.0005).
Quantitative PCR using RNA from patient blood samples revealed a highly
significant (p less than 0.0001) and consistent increase in the V2 and
V3 splice variants (more than 38-fold and more than 12-fold,
respectively) in all patients with intron 7 nucleotide changes, as well
as in a Chinese family with vitreoretinopathy in which a causal variant
was not identified. Mukhopadhyay et al. (2006) suggested that Wagner
vitreoretinopathy is caused by an imbalance of versican isoforms,
mediated by intronic variants.

In a 4-generation French family with a severe vitreoretinal disorder
mapping to 5q13-q14, Brezin et al. (2011) identified a heterozygous
splice site mutation in intron 7 of the VCAN gene (118661.0006) that
segregated with disease and was not found 100 French controls.

In a British family and a French family with Wagner vitreoretinopathy,
Kloeckener-Gruissem et al. (2013) sequenced the VCAN gene and identified
2 heterozygous splice site mutations, in intron 8 and intron 7 of the
VCAN gene, respectively, that segregated with disease in each family
(118661.0007 and 118661.0008). The levels of splice variants V2 and V3
were significantly increased in all patient fibroblast and blood samples
from these families as well as samples from the Swiss family with
vitreoretinopathy originally described by Wagner (1938), although the
magnitude of the increase varied between tissues and mutations. There
were no statistically significant differences in V0 and V1 levels in
fibroblasts or blood between patients and controls.

In a Japanese family with Wagner syndrome (143200) in which members of 4
generations, to a total of 13 with 11 living at the time of study, were
affected, Miyamoto et al. (2005) described a heterozygous splice
acceptor site mutation in the CSPG2 gene: 4004-2 A-G. Results of RT-PCR
analysis indicated that the mutation activated a cryptic splice site
located 39 bp downstream from the authentic 3-prime splice acceptor
site.

In a large 5-generation Swiss family with vitreoretinopathy (143200),
originally described by Wagner (1938), Kloeckener-Gruissem et al. (2006)
identified a heterozygous transition (9265+1G-A) at the highly conserved
splice donor sequence in intron 8 of the VCAN gene, which segregated
with the phenotype in 21 affected and 26 unaffected family members and
was not found in 104 control alleles. RT-PCR analysis using patient RNA
from venous blood revealed 2 aberrant CSPG2 transcripts, 1 lacking the
entire exon 8 and the other missing only the last 21 bp of exon 8.

Kloeckener-Gruissem et al. (2013) analyzed fibroblasts from a member of
the Swiss family with vitreoretinopathy originally described by Wagner
(1938) and found a 700-fold and a 150-fold increase in versican isoforms
V2 and V3, respectively, compared to controls. In patient blood samples,
amounts of V2 and V3 were increased 48-fold and 32-fold, respectively.

In all affected individuals from 5 Dutch families with vitreoretinopathy
(143200), including 4 families diagnosed with Wagner syndrome and 1 with
erosive vitreoretinopathy, Mukhopadhyay et al. (2006) identified
heterozygosity for a transition in intron 7 (4004-5T-C) of the VCAN
gene. The mutation was not found in unaffected individuals from any of
the 5 families, or in 250 Dutch controls. The 5 families shared a common
haplotype on chromosome 5q14, suggesting a founder mutation.
Quantitative PCR using RNA from patient blood samples revealed a highly
significant (p less than 0.0001) and consistent increase in the V2 and
V3 splice variants (more than 38-fold and more than 12-fold,
respectively) compared to controls.

In affected members of a Dutch family with Wagner vitreoretinopathy
(143200), Mukhopadhyay et al. (2006) identified heterozygosity for a
transition in intron 7 (4004-5T-A) of the VCAN gene. The mutation was
not found in unaffected members of the family, or in 250 Dutch controls.
RT-PCR analysis of mutant versican transcripts showed activation of a
cryptic splice site resulting in a 39-nucleotide in-frame deletion of
exon 8 in splice variant V0. Quantitative PCR using RNA from patient
blood samples revealed a highly significant (p less than 0.0001) and
consistent increase in the V2 and V3 splice variants (more than 45-fold
and more than 13-fold, respectively) compared to controls.

In affected members of a Dutch family with Wagner vitreoretinopathy
(143200), Mukhopadhyay et al. (2006) identified heterozygosity for a
transition in intron 7 (4004-1G-A) of the VCAN gene. The mutation was
not found in unaffected members of the family, or in 250 Dutch controls.
RT-PCR analysis of mutant versican transcripts showed activation of a

WAGNER VITREORETINOPATHY
VCAN, IVS7AS, A-T, -2

In 10 affected members of a 4-generation French family with severe
vitreoretinopathy (1432300), Brezin et al. (2011) identified
heterozygosity for a transversion within the highly conserved acceptor
splice site of intron 7 (4004-2A-T) of the VCAN gene. The mutation was
not found in 6 unaffected family members or in 100 French controls.
Patients in this kindred had a highly variable phenotype, including
exudative vascular abnormalities, and exhibited severe visual
impairment. RT-PCR analysis of patient lymphoblastoid cell RNA indicated
that the mutation activates a cryptic acceptor splice site within exon
8, located 39 bp downstream from the authentic 3-prime splice acceptor
site. Direct sequencing of a shortened RNA fragment showed loss of the
first 39 bp of exon 8, predicted to cause in-frame deletion of 13 amino
acid residues from the beginning of the GAG-beta domain of mature
versican. RT-PCR also indicated aberrant expression of a versican mRNA
lacking the entire exon 8.

In 3 affected members of a 4-generation British family with Wagner
vitreoretinopathy (143200), previously studied by Fryer et al. (1990),
Kloeckener-Gruissem et al. (2013) identified heterozygosity for a
transition within the conserved splice donor site of intron 8
(9265+2T-A) of the VCAN gene. The mutation was not found in 300 control
alleles. In patient blood samples, there was a 230-fold and a 143-fold
increase in versican isoforms V2 and V3, respectively, compared to
controls.

In 19 affected members of a 4-generation French family with Wagner
vitreoretinopathy (143200), originally reported by Zech et al. (1999),
Kloeckener-Gruissem et al. (2013) identified heterozygosity for a
transversion within the conserved splice acceptor site of intron 7
(4004-1G-C) of the VCAN gene. The mutation was not found in 19
unaffected family members or in 300 control alleles. In patient
fibroblasts, there was an 80-fold and a 150-fold increase in versican
isoforms V2 and V3, respectively, compared to controls, whereas in
patient blood samples, amounts of V2 and V3 increased 64-fold and
6-fold, respectively.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Genes encoding Ced proteins in worms are crucial for initiating
apoptosis during development. Mammalian Ced4 homologs include APAF1
(602233) and NOD1/CARD4 (605980). DEFCAP is a member of the mammalian
family of Ced4 proteins and is capable of inducing apoptosis (Hlaing et
al., 2001).

CLONING

By screening for cDNAs encoding large proteins expressed in brain,
Nagase et al. (1999) identified a cDNA encoding KIAA0926. The deduced
1,429-amino acid protein is predicted to be 42% identical to a placental
ribonuclease inhibitor (RNH; 173320). RT-PCR analysis detected weak
expression in most tissues, with highest expression in spleen.

By protein database searching for pyrin (608107) domain (PYD)-containing
proteins, Martinon et al. (2001) identified NALP1 and NALP2 (609364), so
symbolized for 'NACHT-, LRR-, and PYD-containing proteins.' The authors
noted that NACHT and LRR domains are found in proteins involved in
inflammation or apoptosis, such as NAIP (600355) and CIITA (600005).
Sequence analysis suggested that PYD, along with the domains DED, CARD,
and DD, is a fourth potential member of the death-domain-fold
superfamily. However, binding analysis indicated that PYD-containing
proteins interact only with other PYD proteins.

By database searching and PCR of a chronic myelogenous leukemia (K562)
cDNA library with primers based on KIAA0926, Hlaing et al. (2001)
isolated cDNAs encoding short and long isoforms of death effector
filament-forming Ced4-like apoptosis protein, or DEFCAP-S and DEFCAP-L.
The longer isoform includes a 132-bp insertion encoding an additional
leucine-rich repeat (LRR) in a 1,473-amino acid protein. Sequence
analysis predicted that both proteins contain a C-terminal CARD domain,
LRRs, and a nucleotide-binding domain, in different positions from those
of NOD1 and APAF1. An N-terminal pyrin-like motif (PLM) is conserved
with other mammalian proteins such as ASC (CARD5), and is evolutionarily
conserved, as seen in sequence alignments with zebrafish ASC1. Northern
blot analysis revealed expression of approximately 7.0- and 8.0-kb
transcripts in most tissues, with highest levels in peripheral blood
leukocytes, heart, thymus, and spleen, but none in brain. High levels
were detected in K562 cells, with weaker or no expression in other
cancer cell lines. Semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis detected both
isoforms in normal tissue and cancer cell lines. Fluorescence microscopy
demonstrated a diffuse cytoplasmic localization.

Soler et al. (2013) examined NLRP1 expression in human fetal and adult
ocular tissues obtained from dissected whole globes, and observed
expression in adult cornea as well as adult and 24-week fetal tissues,
including choroid, sclera, cornea, optic nerve, and adult retina and
fetal retina/retinal pigment epithelium. In addition, NLRP1 was
expressed in corneal epithelia obtained during photorefractive
keratectomy.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1999) mapped the KIAA0926
gene to chromosome 17. By the same method, Hlaing et al. (2001) mapped
the DEFCAP gene to chromosome 17p13.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoprecipitation analysis, Hlaing et al. (2001) demonstrated that
both DEFCAP isoforms interacted strongly with CASP2 (600639), but only
weakly with CASP9 (602234). Transient overexpression of full-length
DEFCAP-L, but not DEFCAP-S, in breast adenocarcinoma cells resulted in
significant apoptosis.

Decreasing oocyte competence with maternal aging is a major factor in
human infertility. To investigate the age-dependent molecular changes in
a mouse model, Hamatani et al. (2004) compared the expression profiles
of metaphase II oocytes collected from 5- to 6-week-old mice with those
collected from 42- to 45-week-old mice using a 22K oligo microarray.
Among approximately 11,000 genes whose transcripts were detected, about
5% showed statistically significant expression changes. Among the
transcripts decreased with aging was a group of oocyte-specific genes,
members of the human NACHT, leucine-rich repeat and PYD-containing
(NALP) gene family.

Using purified recombinant proteins, Faustin et al. (2007) reconstituted
the NALP1 inflammasome to characterize the requirements for inflammasome
assembly and CASP1 (147678) activation. NALP1 oligomerized in a 2-step
process that required a microbial product, muramyl-dipeptide, followed
by ribonucleotide triphosphates. CASP1 activation by NALP1 was enhanced
by ASC (PYCARD; 606838). Faustin et al. (2007) concluded that NALP1 is a
direct sensor of bacterial components in host defense against pathogens.

Guarda et al. (2009) incubated mouse splenocyte naive, memory, and
regulatory T-cell subsets with bone marrow-derived macrophages and
stimulated them with anti-Cd3 (see 186740), followed by
lipopolysaccharide activation and ATP stimulation. They found that
inflammasome-mediated Casp1 activation and secretion of mature Il1b
(147720) was blocked in the presence of memory Cd4 (186940)-positive T
cells, but not other T-cell subsets. Subsequent investigation showed
that multiple activators of Nalp1 and Nalp3 (NLRP3; 606416), but not
Nlrc4 (606831), were inhibited in inflammasome function by memory or in
vitro-activated Cd4-positive T cells. Suppression of Nalp3 inflammasome
function required cell-to-cell contact. Effector Cd4-positive T cells
also decreased neutrophil recruitment in an Nalp3-dependent peritonitis
mouse model. Guarda et al. (2009) concluded that effector and memory
CD4-positive T cells selectively inhibit NALP1 and NALP3 inflammasomes.

Gregory et al. (2011) found that the Kaposi sarcoma-associated
herpesvirus (KSHV) Orf63 is a viral homolog of human NLRP1. Orf63
blocked NLRP1-dependent innate immune responses, including CASP1
activation and processing of interleukins IL1B and IL18 (600953). KSHV
Orf63 interacted with NLRP1, NLRP3, and NOD2 (605956). Inhibition of
Orf63 expression resulted in increased expression of IL1B during the
KSHV life cycle. Furthermore, inhibition of NLRP1 was necessary for
efficient reactivation and generation of progeny virus. The viral
homolog subverts the function of cellular NLRs, which suggested to
Gregory et al. (2011) that modulation of NLR-mediated innate immunity is
important for the lifelong persistence of herpesviruses.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Vitiligo-Associated Autoimmune Disease Susceptibility

Among patients with generalized vitiligo there is an increased frequency
of several autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases (Jin et al., 2007).
There is also an increased frequency of these same disorders among
first-degree relatives of patients with vitiligo, suggesting that some
families have a genetic predisposition to this group of autoimmune and
autoinflammatory diseases. To identify the gene responsible for
vitiligo-related autoimmune disease susceptibility associated with the
17p13 region (VAMAS1; 606579), Jin et al. (2007) performed fine-scale
genetic association and DNA sequence analyses in 114 families with
vitiligo and associated autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases.
Association analyses resulted in identification of NALP1 as a candidate
gene. Fine-scale association mapping using DNA from affected families
and additional SNPs in and around NALP1 showed an association of
specific variants with vitiligo alone, with an extended autoimmune and
autoinflammatory disease phenotype, or with both. Conditional
logistic-regression analysis of NALP1 SNPs indicated that at least 2
variants contribute independently to the risk of disease. Jin et al.
(2007) identified 15 SNPs in the NALP1 region predicted to result in
nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions in the NALP1 protein. Only 1 of
these (leu155 to his; 606636.0001) showed evidence in association, both
with vitiligo alone and with autoimmune inflammatory diseases (p = 0.002
and p = 0.001, respectively, by pedigree disequilibrium test). Five of 6
tightly linked SNPs in the promoter region of NALP1 that were associated
with disease were found to affect high-probability mammalian
transcription factor binding sites.

- Corneal Intraepithelial Dyskeratosis with Ectodermal Dysplasia

In an affected mother and son from a Caucasian French family segregating
autosomal dominant corneal intraepithelial dyskeratosis and ectodermal
dysplasia (CIDED; 615225), Soler et al. (2013) identified heterozygosity
for a missense mutation in the NLRP1 gene (M77T; 606636.0002) that
segregated with the disease and was not found in 672 controls or in 61
exome-sequenced subjects' DNA.

EVOLUTION

Using a population genetics approach to define the ways in which natural
selection has driven evolution of NOD-like microbial receptors (NLRs) in
various human populations, Vasseur et al. (2012) identified 2,084 SNPs,
including 396 nonsynonymous SNPs, 4 nonsense variants, and 12 coding
region insertion/deletions. Overall, members of the NALP subfamily,
which includes NLRP1 through NLRP14 (609665), had undergone strong
purifying selection with little functional diversity. In contrast,
members of the NOD/IPAF subfamily, which includes NOD1 through NOD4
(NLRC5; 613537), as well as NOD9 (NLRX1; 611947), CIITA, and NLRC4, had
undergone weak negative selection. After expanding their studies to
include other major families of microbial sensors, Vasseur et al. (2012)
distinguished 3 groups of innate immunity genes that differed in their
evolutionary patterns: those under strong selective constraints (most
NALPs and endosomal Toll-like receptors (e.g., TLR3; 603029)), those
under weaker constraints (most NOD/IPAFs and cytosolic RIGI-like
receptors (e.g., DDX58; 609631)), and those that did not appear to
deviate from neutrality (most cell surface Toll-like receptors (e.g.,
TLR1; 601194)).

ANIMAL MODEL

Using chemical mutagenesis, Masters et al. (2012) generated mice with an
activating glu593-to-pro (Q593P) mutation in Nlrp1a. The mutation likely
occurred in a flex linker region of the protein between the NACHT and
LRR domains. Although grossly normal, mice homozygous for the Q593P
mutation had neutrophilic inflammatory disease in multiple organs. The
disease was dependent on Il1b and Casp1, but independent of Asc and
Casp11 (CASP4; 602664). Homozygous Q593P mice had elevated levels of
Il18. Histologic analysis showed that Q593P mice that also lacked Il18
had increased circulating neutrophils and mortality, which was
associated with increased myocarditis. In contrast, hepatitis was absent
in these mice, suggesting that IL18 is protective against myocarditis
but enhances liver inflammation. Hemopoietic stress induced in Q593P
mice by chemotherapy or lymphocytic choriomeningitis infection caused
prolonged cytopenia, bone marrow hyperplasia, and immunosuppression.
Mice lacking Nlrp1a showed enhanced recovery from these stresses,
indicating that NLRP1 acts as a cellular sentinel to alert CASP1 to
hemopoietic stress and infection.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
VITILIGO-ASSOCIATED MULTIPLE AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY 1
NLRP1, LEU155HIS

In a study of families with vitiligo-associated multiple autoimmune
disease (VAMAS1; 606579), Jin et al. (2007) identified association of a
nonsynonymous change in the coding region of the NALP1 gene, leu155 to
his (L155H; dbSNP rs12150220), with susceptibility both to vitiligo
alone and to autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases. The L155H
substitution occurs between the N-terminal pyrin and NACHT domains of
the NALP1 polypeptide, within a region highly conserved through primate
evolution. An association was also identified with another SNP in the
promoter region.

.0002
CORNEAL INTRAEPITHELIAL DYSKERATOSIS AND ECTODERMAL DYSPLASIA (1 family)
NLRP1, MET77THR

In an affected mother and son from a Caucasian French family segregating
autosomal dominant corneal intraepithelial dyskeratosis and ectodermal
dysplasia (CIDED; 615225), Soler et al. (2013) identified heterozygosity
for a c.230T-C transition in exon 1 of the NRLP1 gene, resulting in a
met77-to-thr (M77T) substitution at a conserved residue at the end of
the fourth alpha helix, predicted to destabilize the protein structure.
The mutation was not present in the unaffected maternal grandparents,
and was not found in 672 controls or in 61 exome-sequenced subjects'
DNA.

609756	TITLE *609756 CHRNA7/FAM7A FUSION GENE; CHRFAM7A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The CHRFAM7A gene on chromosome 15 is a hybrid consisting of a partial
duplication of the CHRNA7 gene (118511) fused to a copy of the FAM7A
gene (Riley et al., 2002).

CLONING

By sequence analysis, 5-prime RACE of hippocampus mRNA, and EST database
analysis, Gault et al. (1998) cloned CHRFAM7A, a gene consisting of a
duplication of exons 5 through 10 of the CHRNA7 gene fused 3-prime to 4
novel exons (D, C, B, and A). Both the full-length transcript and a
splice variant lacking exon B were expressed.

By 5-prime RACE, Riley et al. (2002) identified a CHRFAM7A splice
variant containing a novel exon, exon E, between exons B and A. They
determined that exons E through A of CHRFAM7A represent a duplication of
the FAM7A gene, which is copied several times on chromosome 15.

Using RT-PCR, de Lucas-Cerrillo et al. (2011) cloned full-length human
CHRFAM7A, which they called DUP-alpha-7, from thalamus and macrophage
RNA. The deduced 412-amino acid protein has 4 transmembrane domains,
extracellular N and C termini, and a long intracellular loop between
transmembrane domains 3 and 4. CHRMFAM7A lacks the long N-terminal
domain of CHRNA7 and therefore lacks recognition sites for acetylcholine
(ACh) and alpha-bungarotoxin. Northern blot analysis detected a CHRFAM7A
transcript of about 3.9 kb in HL-60 human myeloid leukemia cells and
human cortex. Transcripts of 5.8, 3.3, 2.1, and 1.4 kb were also
detected in human cortex. Quantitative PCR showed higher expression of
CHRNA7 than CHRFAM7A in human cortex, whereas CHRFAM7A predominated in
macrophages.

GENE FUNCTION

By electrophysiologic recording of transfected GH4C1 rat pituitary cells
and injected Xenopus oocytes, de Lucas-Cerrillo et al. (2011) found that
CHRFAM7A had a dominant-negative effect on the amplitude of ACh-elicited
CHRNA7 currents, which was due to reduced surface expression of CHRNA7.
Stimulation of CHRNA7 in macrophages induces an antiinflammatory
response. De Lucas-Cerrillo et al. (2011) found that the cytokine
IL1-beta (IL1B; 147720) and lipopolysaccharide reduced CHRFAM7A
expression in macrophages, suggesting the presence of a feedback loop
that attenuates the inflammatory response. Nicotine also markedly
reduced expression of CHRFAM7A mRNA in human macrophages.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gault et al. (1998) determined that the CHRFAM7A gene contains 10 exons.
Riley et al. (2002) identified an additional CHRFAM7A exon.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Gault et al. (1998) mapped the CHRFAM7A
gene to chromosome 15q13-q14, about 1 Mb centromeric of the CHRNA7 gene.
Riley et al. (2002) determined that the CHRFAM7A gene is in the opposite
orientation to the CHRNA7 gene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Gault et al. (1998) identified the CHRFAM7A gene in all 14 normal
individuals studied.

Riley et al. (2002) found that the CHRFAM7A gene was present in most
individuals from a sample of South African Bantu families with
schizophrenia (see 181500). However, they identified a father and son
lacking CHRFAM7A and concluded that, while commonly present, CHRFAM7A is
not represented on every human chromosome 15. Flomen et al. (2008)
stated that the CHRFAM7A null allele occurs with a frequency of about
10%.

The structure and orientation of the CHRFAM7A gene suggests that an
inversion has occurred since the partial duplication of CHRNA7. Using
FISH analysis to investigate interphase chromosomes in 12 individuals,
Flomen et al. (2008) confirmed the occurrence of a polymorphic inversion
and found that CHRFAM7A exists in both orientations with similar
frequency. A 2-bp deletion polymorphism in exon 6 of CHRFAM7A was in
strong linkage disequilibrium with the inversion polymorphism (p =
0.00003), always occurring when CHRFAM7A was in the same orientation as
CHRNA7. Flomen et al. (2008) noted that associations of endophenotypes
of schizophrenia with the 2-bp deletion might be due to the orientation
of the duplicon containing CHRFAM7A.

EVOLUTION

The partial duplication of CHRNA7 is a recent molecular event unique to
humans, with only CHRNA7 and not CHRFAM7A present in other higher
primates (Flomen et al., 2008).

;;MGC10882;;
NERVOUS SYSTEM POLYCOMB 1; NSPC1;;
LETHAL(3)73AH, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PCGF1 is a mammalian homolog of the Drosophila polycomb group genes,
which act as transcriptional repressors to regulate anterior-posterior
patterning in early embryonic development (Nunes et al., 2001). See also
PCGF2 (600346).

CLONING

By searching for cDNAs containing a RING finger motif, followed by
screening a human testis and heart cDNA library, Nunes et al. (2001)
cloned PCGF1, which they called NSPC1. The deduced 259-amino acid
protein contains an N-terminal RING finger domain and shares 97.5% amino
acid identity with mouse Nspc1, and 39% identity with both mammalian
Pcgf2 and Bmi1 (164831). Northern blot analysis detected a 1.4-kb major
transcript with highest expression in adult human colon, small
intestine, prostate, and testis, and a 1.0-kb minor transcript, which
lacks the RING finger domain, with low expression in small intestine,
colon, and peripheral blood leukocytes. By in situ hybridization of
mouse embryos, Nunes et al. (2001) demonstrated that Nspc1 is first
expressed 10.5 days postcoitum (dpc) in the otic vesicle, the anterior
limb bud of the dorsal root ganglia, and the genital tubercle. At 11.5
dpc, expression was observed in the dorsal root ganglia, dorsal
epithelium of the neural tube, heart, and branchial arches. The authors
detected Nspc1 expression in a subset of neural crest cell derivatives,
which give rise to the peripheral nervous system. By 13.5 dpc, Nunes et
al. (2001) detected widespread Nspc1 expression.

GENE STRUCTURE

Nunes et al. (2001) determined that the PCGF1 gene contains 9 exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nunes et al. (2001) mapped the PCGF1 gene
to chromosome 2p13. The mouse Pcgf1 gene was mapped to a syntenic region
on mouse chromosome 6.
