609575	TITLE *609575 ACYL-CoA DEHYDROGENASE, VERY LONG-CHAIN; ACADVL
;;VLCAD
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ACADVL gene encodes very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD)
(EC 1.3.99.13). VLCAD is unique among the acyl-CoA dehydrogenases in its
size, structure, and intramitochondrial distribution (Aoyama et al.,
1995).

CLONING

Izai et al. (1992) identified and purified a novel acyl-CoA
dehydrogenase, Acadvl, from rat liver mitochondria.

Aoyama et al. (1995) cloned and sequenced 2 overlapping cDNA clones
corresponding to human mitochondrial VLCAD. The cDNA encodes a 655-amino
acid protein with a 40-amino acid leader peptide, yielding a mature
615-residue protein.

Whereas the other acyl-CoA dehydrogenases are homotetramers of a 43- to
45-kD subunit, VLCAD purified from human liver was shown by Aoyama et
al. (1995) to be a 154-kD homodimer of a 70-kD subunit. VLCAD was
loosely bound to the mitochondrial inner membrane and required detergent
for stabilization. In contrast, the other 3 acyl-CoA dehydrogenases
others were readily extractable into the soluble fraction without
detergent, indicating that they are located in the mitochondrial matrix.

Andresen et al. (1996) isolated cDNA clones for human VLCAD by using rat
Vlcad cDNA sequences to identify an EST from human fetal brain in the
GenBank database, followed by 5-prime and 3-prime rapid amplification of
cDNA ends (RACE) to identify overlapping clones. Sequence analysis of
the coding region and the 5-prime noncoding region of the VLCAD cDNA
showed no differences with the sequence published by Aoyama et al.
(1995). Andresen et al. (1996) found 26 to 33% homology between VLCAD
and other human acyl-CoA dehydrogenases. Northern blot analysis detected
a 2.4-kb mRNA transcript in a variety of human tissues.

By real-time RT-PCR, Zhou and Blumberg (2003) detected VLCAD expression
in all tissues examined, with highest expression in heart and skeletal
muscle, followed by placenta and pancreas.

GENE FUNCTION

Izai et al. (1992) found that the properties of Acadvl purified from rat
liver mitochondria differed from those of the short (ACADS; 606885)-,
medium (ACADM; 607008)-, and long (ACADL; 609576)-chain acyl-CoA
dehydrogenases. Acadvl was active toward very long-chain fatty acids.

Aoyama et al. (1995) found that human VLCAD had 10 times higher specific
activity toward palmitoyl-CoA than did LCAD. The enzyme was found to
catalyze the major part of mitochondrial palmitoyl-CoA dehydrogenation
in liver, heart, skeletal muscle, and skin fibroblasts.

GENE STRUCTURE

Strauss et al. (1995) determined that the ACADVL gene contains 20 exons.
The ACADVL gene is about 5.4 kb long (Zhou and Blumberg, 2003).

Zhang et al. (2003) noted that the VLCAD and the DLG4 (602887) genes are
located in a head-to-head orientation on chromosome 17p. The transcribed
regions of the 2 genes overlap by about 220 bp. Using serial promoter
partial deletion constructs in a reporter gene assay, they found that
the essential promoter activity of DLG4 is carried within a region of
about 400 bp and covers the entire VLCAD minimal promoter, which spans
about 270 bp. The results from di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate
(DEHP)-treated HepG2 cells revealed that the minimal VLCAD promoter can
upregulate VLCAD expression in response to DEHP treatment. Site-directed
mutagenesis experiments showed that a mutated AP2 (107580)-binding site
markedly reduced the transcriptional activity of both the VLCAD and DLG4
promoters and abolished the minimal VLCAD promoter's response to DEHP
treatment.

Independently, Zhou and Blumberg (2003) determined that the VLCAD and
DLG4 genes overlap. The 2 genes share 245 nucleotides at their 5-prime
ends, and the transcription start site for DLG4 extends into the coding
region of VLCAD exon 1. The upstream regions of the VLCAD and DLG4
genes, including the overlapping region, contain 2 potential TATA-less
promoters with potential binding sites for several common transcription
factors. RT-PCR detected unique patterns of expression for VLCAD and
DLG4, indicating that, although they share common regulatory elements,
VLCAD and DLG4 also have distinct tissue-specific elements. The mouse
Dlg4 and Vlcad genes are oriented in a head-to-head manner, but they do
not overlap and are separated by almost 3.5 kb.

MAPPING

Andresen et al. (1996) mapped the ACADVL gene to human chromosome
17p13.1-p11.2 by analysis of rodent-human hybrids.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Orii et al. (1997) mapped the
murine Acadvl gene to chromosome 11 in a region of synteny to human
17p13.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In cultured fibroblasts of 2 patients with VLCAD deficiency (201475),
Aoyama et al. (1995) identified a 105-bp deletion in the ACADVL gene
(609575.0001).

Andresen et al. (1996) identified 9 different mutations in the ACADVL
gene in 4 unrelated patients with VLCAD deficiency. Two patients carried
3 different mutations. Different mutations were observed in each of the
patients. Western blot analysis on fibroblasts from 3 of the patients
revealed severe quantitative reduction in VLCAD protein.

Mathur et al. (1999) identified 21 different mutations in the ACADVL
gene in 18 of 37 children with cardiomyopathy, nonketotic hypoglycemia
and hepatic dysfunction, skeletal myopathy, or sudden death in infancy
with hepatic steatosis. Sixty-seven percent of children had severe
dilated or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy at presentation. In 7 patients,
only 1 mutation was found despite direct sequencing of all exons.
Missense, frameshift, and splice consensus sequence mutations were seen,
as well as in-frame deletions. Eighty percent of these mutations were
associated with cardiomyopathy. The authors concluded that infantile
cardiomyopathy is the most common clinical phenotype for VLCAD
deficiency and highlighted the marked allelic heterogeneity in this
disorder.

Since VLCAD-deficient patients frequently harbor missense mutations with
unpredictable effects on enzyme activity, Gobin-Limballe et al. (2007)
investigated the response to bezafibrate as a function of genotype in 33
VLCAD-deficient fibroblast cell lines representing 45 different
mutations. Treatment with bezafibrate (400 microM for 48 hours) resulted
in a marked increase in FAO capacities, often leading to restoration of
normal values, for 21 genotypes that mainly corresponded to patients
with the myopathic phenotype. In contrast, bezafibrate induced no
changes in FAO for 11 genotypes corresponding to severe neonatal or
infantile phenotypes. This pattern of response was not due to
differential inductions of VLCAD mRNA, as shown by quantitative
real-time PCR, but reflected variable increases in measured VLCAD
residual enzyme activity in response to bezafibrate. Genotype
cross-analysis allowed the identification of alleles carrying missense
mutations, which could account for these different pharmacologic
profiles and, on this basis, led to the characterization of 9 mild and
11 severe missense mutations. The responses to bezafibrate reflected the
severity of the metabolic blockage in various genotypes, which appeared
to be correlated with the phenotype. This study emphasized the potential
of bezafibrate, a widely prescribed hypolipidemic drug, for the
correction of VLCAD deficiency and exemplified the integration of
molecular information in a therapeutic strategy.

ANIMAL MODEL

Cox et al. (2001) generated mice with VLCAD deficiency (Vlcad -/-) and
compared their pathologic and biochemical phenotypes to mice with Lcad
deficiency (Lcad -/-) and wildtype mice. Vlcad -/- mice had milder fatty
acid change in liver and heart. Dehydrogenation of various acyl-CoA
substrates by liver, heart, and skeletal muscle mitochondria differed
among the 3 genotypes. The results for liver were most informative as
Vlcad -/- mice had a reduction in activity toward palmitoyl-CoA and
oleoyl-CoA (58% and 64% of wildtype, respectively), whereas Lcad -/-
mice showed a more profoundly reduced activity toward these substrates
(35% and 32% of wildtype, respectively), with a significant reduction of
activity toward the branched chain substrate 2,6-dimethylheptanoyl-CoA.
C16 and C18 acylcarnitines were elevated in bile, blood, and serum of
fasted Vlcad -/- mice, whereas abnormally elevated C12 and C14
acylcarnitines were prominent in Lcad -/- mice. Progeny with the
combined Lcad +/+//Vlcad +/- genotype were overrepresented in offspring
from sires and dams heterozygous for both Lcad and Vlcad mutations. In
contrast, no live mice with a compound Lcad -/-/Vlcad -/- genotype were
detected, suggesting that this genotype may be lethal in utero or in the
periparturient period.

To define the onset and molecular mechanism of myocardial disease, Exil
et al. (2003) generated Vlcad-deficient mice by homologous
recombination. They found that Vlcad-deficient hearts had microvesicular
lipid accumulation and marked mitochondrial proliferation, and
demonstrated facilitated induction of polymorphic ventricular
tachycardia, without antecedent stress. The expression of acyl-CoA
synthetase-1 (ACS1; 152425), adipophilin, Ap2, cytochrome c, and the
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1 (PPARGC1;
604517) were increased immediately after birth, preceding overt
histologic lipidosis, whereas Acs1 expression was markedly downregulated
in the adult heart. Exil et al. (2003) concluded that mice with Vlcad
deficiency have altered expression of a variety of genes in the fatty
acid metabolic pathway from birth, reflecting metabolic feedback
circuits, with progression to ultrastructural and physiologic correlates
of the associated human disease in the absence of stress.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
VLCAD DEFICIENCY
ACADVL, 105-BP DEL

In 2 patients with VLCAD deficiency (201475), Aoyama et al. (1995)
identified a 105-bp deletion encompassing bases 1078-1182 in the VLCAD
cDNA. The deletion was thought to result from exon skipping and was
predicted to result in the in-frame deletion of 35 amino acids,
beginning with val360 of the precursor VLCAD. Using the vaccinia viral
system, Aoyama et al. (1995) performed quantitative cDNA expression of
normal human VLCAD in the patients' fibroblasts and demonstrated that
raising VLCAD activity to approximately 20% of normal control fibroblast
activity raised palmitic acid beta-oxidation flux to the level found in
control fibroblasts. The mutation described in these patients has
consequences for enzyme folding and assembly that are similar to those
for the well-characterized A985G mutation (lys329-to-glu; 607008.0001)
found in approximately 90% of the mutant alleles in patients with MCAD
deficiency (201450).

.0002
VLCAD DEFICIENCY
ACADVL, IVS11, G-A, +1

In a patient with VLCAD deficiency (201475) associated with infantile
cardiomyopathy and sudden death, Strauss et al. (1995) identified a
homozygous G-to-A transition in the consensus dinucleotide of the donor
splice site in intron 11 of the ACADVL gene, resulting in the skipping
of exon 11.

.0003
VLCAD DEFICIENCY
ACADVL, ARG613TRP

In a patient with VLCAD deficiency (201475), Souri et al. (1996)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the ACADVL gene: a
1837C-T transition, resulting in an arg613-to-trp (R613W) amino acid
substitution, and a 135-bp deletion of nucleotides 343-477, resulting in
the loss of 45 amino acids from the VLCAD protein (609575.0005).

.0004
VLCAD DEFICIENCY
ACADVL, IVS5, 1-BP DEL, G, -1

In a patient with VLCAD deficiency (201475) associated with infantile
cardiomyopathy and sudden death, Strauss et al. (1995) identified
compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the ACADVL gene: R613W
(609575.0003) and a 1-bp deletion of one of the 2 guanine nucleotides
forming the intron-exon 6 boundary. The normal sequence is ccccagGAA and
the mutant sequence was cccaGAA. The authors noted that the most likely
consequence of this deletion would be an alternation in splicing because
of loss of the conserved ag dinucleotide at the splice acceptor site.
Alternatively, splicing at this site might occur but this would result
in loss of a single nucleotide in exon 6, causing a shift in the mRNA
reading frame. In either event, this mutation would most likely result
in an unstable mRNA and lack of VLCAD protein expression from the mutant
allele.

.0006
VLCAD DEFICIENCY
ACADVL, 3-BP DEL, GLU130DEL

In a patient with VLCAD deficiency (201475), Souri et al. (1996)
identified a homozygous 3-bp deletion in the ACADVL gene, resulting in
deletion of glu130. In another patient, Souri et al. (1996) found the
3-bp deletion mutation in compound heterozygosity with the K382Q
mutation (609575.0008).

.0007
VLCAD DEFICIENCY
ACADVL, 3-BP DEL, LYS299DEL

In an infant with VLCAD deficiency (201475), Souri et al. (1996) found
deletion of nucleotides 895 and 897 in the ACADVL gene, resulting in
deletion of lys299 (K299X).

.0008
VLCAD DEFICIENCY
ACADVL, LYS382GLN

In an infant with VLCAD deficiency (201475), Souri et al. (1996)
identified a 1144A-C transversion in the ACADVL gene, resulting in a
lys382-to-gln (K382Q) amino acid substitution.

.0009
VLCAD DEFICIENCY
ACADVL, GLY401ASP

In a 42-year-old woman with late-onset VLCAD deficiency (201475), Smelt
et al. (1998) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
ACADVL gene: a G-to-A transition in exon 13, resulting in a
gly401-to-asp (G401D) substitution, and a G-to-A transition in exon 14,
resulting in an arg410-to-his (R410H; 609575.0010) substitution. The
patient had recurrent rhabdomyolysis and markedly elevated levels of
tetradecadienoic acid and hexadecadienoic acid.

.0011
VLCAD DEFICIENCY
ACADVL, PRO65LEU AND LYS247GLN

In an Israeli patient with VLCAD deficiency (201475), Watanabe et al.
(2000) found homozygosity for a complex mutant allele with pro65-to-leu
(P65L) and lys247-to-gln (K247Q) mutations in the ACADVL gene. The P65L
mutation resulted in the skipping of exon 3. The nucleotide substitution
causing the P65L amino acid change was a 194C-T transition located 11
bases upstream of the normal splice donor site of intron 3. This is an
example of an exonic mutation that affects exon splicing; a similar
situation had been described in the ACAT1 gene (see 203750.0009). RT-PCR
showed 2 cDNA fragments of different sizes. One had the expected size
and the other was shorter by 66 basepairs. In the case of P65L, the
amino acid change did not reduce enzyme activity, whereas the K247Q
mutation reduced it drastically.

.0012
VLCAD DEFICIENCY
ACADVL, PHE458LEU

In a patient with VLCAD deficiency (201475), Cox et al. (1998)
identified a 1372T-C transition in the ACADVL gene, resulting in a
phe458-to-leu (F458L) substitution.

.0013
VLCAD DEFICIENCY
ACADVL, ALA416THR

In a 14-year-old Japanese girl with very mild manifestations of VLCAD
deficiency (201475), Fukao et al. (2001) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the ACADVL gene: 1 resulting in an
ala416-to-thr (A416T) substitution, and the other resulting in an
arg450-to-his (R450H; 609575.0014) substitution. In vitro functional
expression studies showed that both mutant proteins retained residual
activity at 30 degrees Celsius. Fukao et al. (2001) concluded that the
temperature-sensitive mild mutations resulted in the milder phenotype in
this patient.

180370	TITLE *180370 THIOSULFATE SULFURTRANSFERASE; TST
;;RHODANESE; RDS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (EC 2.8.1.1), also known as rhodanese, is
a ubiquitous enzyme present in all living organisms from bacteria to
man. The enzyme catalyzes the cyanide-dependent cleavage of thiosulfate
to form thiocyanate and sulfite (summary by Aminlari et al., 2007).

CLONING

By screening a human fetal liver cDNA expression library with a
monoclonal antibody against bovine liver rhodanese, Aita et al. (1997)
cloned a RDS cDNA. Northern blot analysis showed that the RDS gene is
expressed as a 1.3-kb mRNA. It encodes a predicted 297-amino acid
protein that is approximately 90% identical to rodent and bovine Rds.
Aita et al. (1997) stated that RDS and MPST (602496) share 60% amino
acid sequence identity. Transient expression of the RDS cDNA in E. coli
and in mammalian cells resulted in significantly increased rhodanese
activity.

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the TST gene to chromosome 22q12.3 based on an
alignment of the TST sequence (GenBank GENBANK B1820468) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37). The MPST gene also maps to 22q12.3.

GENE FUNCTION

Delivery of 5S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) (see 180420) to the nucleus involves
a complex intracellular trafficking pattern that includes nuclear export
and reimport in association with ribosomal protein L5 (RPL5; 603634). A
portion of 5S rRNA can also be diverted to mitochondria, where it
participates in mitochondrial protein synthesis. Smirnov et al. (2010)
found that human 5S rRNA required 2 protein factors for mitochondrial
import, and they identified 1 of these as mitochondrial rhodanese.
Rhodanese bound to 5S rRNA cotranslationally to form a tight complex. In
this complex, 5S rRNA functioned as a chaperone for misfolded rhodanese
and maintained rhodanese in its enzymatically inactive form. Interaction
with rhodanese was required for mitochondrial import of 5S rRNA.
Knockdown of rhodanese in human HepG2 cells via small interfering RNA
reduced mitochondrial translational activity and reduced cell growth on
galactose-containing medium, indicating insufficient mitochondrial
respiration activity.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Rhodanese is monomorphic in most populations, but by starch gel
electrophoresis Scott and Wright (1980) found polymorphism in 2
linguistic groups of Athabaskan Indians. The enzyme is monomeric since
no bands of intermediate mobility were found in heterozygotes. The
frequency of the RDS-1 and RDS-2 alleles were estimated to be about 0.82
and 0.18, and about 0.87 and 0.13, respectively, in the 2 Indian groups.

Whitehouse et al. (1988) found no genetic variants of rhodanese in a
study of material from European populations.

Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by
Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

HISTORY

Cagianut et al. (1981) found much reduced activity of rhodanese in the
livers of 2 males with Leber optic atrophy (535000) from a well-studied
Swiss family with 5 symptomatic persons in 4 generations. Nikoskelainen
(1984) could not confirm the reported low activity of rhodanese in Leber
optic atrophy patients. Whitehouse et al. (1989) studied rhodanese
isozymes in liver biopsies from 3 subjects with Leber optic neuropathy.
No qualitative abnormality and no deficiency could be found, thus
excluding the hypothesis of rhodanese deficiency.

;;TBP1-INTERACTING PROTEIN; TBPIP;;
GT198;;
HOP2, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; HOP2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The PSMC3IP gene encodes a nuclear, tissue-specific protein with
multiple functions, including a role in meiotic recombination and as a
coactivator of ligand-dependent transcription mediated by nuclear
hormone receptors (summary by Zangen et al., 2011).

CLONING

By sequencing putative genes centromeric to the BRCA1 gene (113705) on
chromosome 17, followed by screening a breast cancer cell line cDNA
library, Rommens et al. (1995) cloned GT198. The deduced protein
contains 203 amino acids. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.6-kb
transcript in all adult and fetal tissues examined, with abundant
expression in testis, colon, a breast cancer cell line, and a lymphoma.

Tanaka et al. (1997) cloned Gt198, which they called Tbpip, from a mouse
testis cDNA library. The deduced 217-amino acid protein has several
putative phosphorylation sites. RT-PCR detected Tbpip expression in CD4
(186940)-positive T cells and in macrophages. In situ hybridization
found Tbpip mRNA colocalized with Tbp1 (186852) in seminiferous tubules
of adult mouse testis. Western blot analysis detected Tbpip at an
apparent molecular mass of 24 kD. Immunohistochemical analysis of mouse
testis detected Tbpip in nuclei of primary and secondary spermatocytes.

By PCR using primers designed from mouse Tbpip, Ijichi et al. (2000)
cloned full-length human TBPIP from breast cancer cell line mRNA and a
testis cDNA library. The deduced 217-amino acid protein contains an
acidic region near the C terminus and several putative phosphorylation
sites. Mouse and human TBPIP share 88% amino acid homology.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Rommens et al. (1995) mapped the TBPIP
gene to chromosome 17q21. Using radiation hybrid analysis, Ijichi et al.
(2000) mapped the TBPIP gene to chromosome 17q12-q21.

GENE FUNCTION

The human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) regulatory protein Tat is
essential for HIV-1 gene expression and replication in infected cells.
TBP1 is a cellular protein that suppresses Tat-mediated transactivation
of HIV replication. Tanaka et al. (1997) found that mouse Tbpip
synergistically cooperated with Tbp1 to suppress Tat-mediated
transactivation of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter.

Ijichi et al. (2000) showed that human TBPIP interacted directly with
TBP1 and enhanced TBP1-mediated inhibition of HIV Tat-mediated
transactivation.

Enomoto et al. (2006) demonstrated that coexpression of human MND1
(611422) and HOP2 in E. coli resulted in the formation of stable
heterodimers. The HOP2-MND1 complex stimulated DMC1 (602721)- and RAD51
(179617)-mediated DNA strand exchange, and preferentially bound to a
3-stranded DNA branch, which mimics the strand-exchange intermediate.
Enomoto et al. (2006) concluded that the HOP2-MND1 complex may ensure
proper pairing between homologous chromosomes by stimulating strand
exchange during meiosis.

Chi et al. (2007) found that the Hop2 component of the mouse recombinant
Hop2-Mnd1 complex was the major DNA-binding subunit, and that Mnd1 was
the Rad51-interacting entity. Hop2-Mnd1 stabilized the
Rad51-single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) nucleoprotein filament, and enhanced
the ability of the Rad51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament to capture duplex
DNA, which is an obligatory step in the formation of the synaptic
complex critical for DNA joint formation. Pezza et al. (2007) showed
that the mouse Hop2-Mnd1 complex stimulated Dmc1 to promote synaptic
complex formation on long duplex DNAs. Synaptic alignment was a
consequence of the ability of Hop2-Mnd1 to stabilize the Dmc1-ssDNA
nucleoprotein complex and facilitate the conjoining of DNA molecules
through the capture of double-stranded DNA by the Dmc1-ssDNA
nucleoprotein filament.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a large consanguineous Arab Palestinian pedigree with
hypergonadotropic ovarian dysgenesis mapping to chromosome 17 (ODG3;
614324), Zangen et al. (2011) analyzed candidate genes and identified
homozygosity for a 3-bp deletion in the PSMC3IP gene (608665.0001) that
segregated with disease in the family. In cell lines, the glu201del
mutation abolished PSMC3IP activation of estrogen-driven transcription.

ANIMAL MODEL

Petukhova et al. (2003) found that Hop2 knockout mice showed no gross
anomalies in somatic tissues but developed a profound deficiency in
gametogenesis. Hop2 -/- spermatocytes arrested at the stage of
pachytene-like chromosome condensation. Axial elements were fully
developed, but synapsis was limited. While meiotic double-stranded
breaks were formed and processed in Hop2 -/- mice, they failed to be
repaired.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
OVARIAN DYSGENESIS 3
PSMC3IP, 3-BP DEL, 600GAG

In affected members of a large consanguineous Arab Palestinian pedigree
with hypergonadotropic ovarian dysgenesis (ODG3; 614324), Zangen et al.
(2011) identified homozygosity for an in-frame 3-bp deletion in the
acceptor splice junction of exon 8 of the PSMC3IP gene, resulting in
deletion of glu201. The unaffected parents were heterozygous for the
deletion, which was not found in 254 ethnically matched chromosomes.
RT-PCR analysis of leukocyte DNA from affected and unaffected family
members showed no alternative splicing, suggesting that the mutation
does not affect PSMC3IP splicing. Transfection studies in the IGROV1
ovarian carcinoma and MCF7 breast cancer cell lines demonstrated that
the glu201del mutation abolished PSMC3IP activation of estrogen-driven
transcription.

601045	TITLE *601045 CATENIN, DELTA-1; CTNND1
;;CATENIN, DELTA; CTNND;;
CADHERIN-ASSOCIATED SRC SUBSTRATE; CAS;;
p120(CTN)
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Catenins were discovered as proteins that are linked ('catena' means
'chain' in Latin) to the cytoplasmic domain of transmembrane cadherin
(see 601120) proteins. Delta-catenin, also called CAS, p120(cas), or
p120(ctn), is a tyrosine kinase substrate implicated in ligand-induced
receptor signaling through the EGF receptor (131550), the PDGF receptor
(PDGFR; see 173490), and the CSF1 receptor (164770), as well as in cell
transformation by SRC (190090). Delta-catenin is a major component of
multiprotein cell-cell adhesion complexes containing E-cadherin
(192090), alpha-catenin (116805), beta-catenin (116806), and
gamma-catenin, also known as plakoglobin (173325) (summary by
Keirsebilck et al., 1998).

CLONING

Reynolds et al. (1992) isolated a mouse p120(ctn) cDNA. Like
beta-catenin and plakoglobin, the predicted protein contains copies of a
repeat originally identified in the Drosophila 'Armadillo' protein.

Keirsebilck et al. (1998) identified human p120(ctn) isoforms, which
they designated 1 to 4, that arise by alternative use of start codons
and additional isoforms that differ due to alternative splicing of 3
exons, which they named A, B, and C. The longest isoform was of type
1ABC and contained 968 amino acids. Isoform 1A contains 933 amino acids
and is 97% identical to mouse p120(ctn). Human p120(ctn) contains up to
10 Armadillo repeats. Keirsebilck et al. (1998) used RT-PCR to
demonstrate tissue-specific and cell line-specific expression of various
isoforms.

Independently, Nagase et al. (1997) identified KIAA0384, a human
p120(ctn) cDNA that encodes isoform 1AC, in a screen for brain cDNAs
encoding proteins larger than 100 kD. RT-PCR detected expression in all
tissues examined except skeletal muscle. Highest expression was detected
in placenta, lung, liver, and kidney, followed by ovary and small
intestine.

GENE FUNCTION

Dillon et al. (1998) reported that a complete loss of p120(ctn)
expression was observed in approximately 10% of invasive ductal breast
carcinomas investigated.

Wildenberg et al. (2006) found that depletion of p120-catenin in NIH3T3
mouse fibroblasts by small interfering RNA caused constitutive
activation of Rho (RHOA; 165390), cell transformation, loss of contact
inhibition, and growth in the absence of serum. Moreover, Pdgfr and
integrin (see 135630) signaling pathways involved in remodeling the
actin cytoskeleton were selectively impaired. Wildenberg et al. (2006)
traced these effects to obligatory roles of p120-catenin and Arhgap5
(602680) in a pathway that connects Rac (RAC1; 602048) activation to Rho
inhibition. They concluded that p120-catenin and ARHGAP5 use Rho GTPases
to mediate crosstalk between a wide variety of receptors to coordinate
cadherin function with other activities that direct cell adhesion,
motility, and proliferation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Keirsebilck et al. (1998) determined that the human p120(ctn) gene
contains 21 exons, potentially encoding up to 32 protein isoforms as
products of alternative splicing.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Reynolds et al. (1996) determined
that the human gene, symbolized CTNND, is localized immediately adjacent
to the centromere in band 11q11. By interspecific backcross analysis,
they assigned the murine gene, symbolized Catns, to the middle of mouse
chromosome 2. By analysis of radiation hybrids, Nagase et al. (1997)
confirmed that the p120 gene maps to human chromosome 11. By
fluorescence in situ hybridization and analysis of a somatic cell hybrid
mapping panel, Bonne et al. (1998) mapped the CTNND1 gene to chromosome
11q11.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using conditional targeting of p120(ctn) in mouse epidermis,
Perez-Moreno et al. (2006) found that p120-null neonatal epidermis
exhibited reduced intercellular adherens junction components, but no
overt disruption in barrier function or intercellular adhesion. As the
mice aged, they displayed epidermal hypoplasia and chronic inflammation,
typified by hair degeneration and loss of body fat. Use of skin
engraftments and antiinflammatory drugs showed that these features were
not due to reductions in junctional cadherins and catenins, but rather
to NF-kappa-B (see 164011) activation. Both in vivo and in vitro,
p120-null epidermal cells activated NF-kappa-B, triggering a cascade of
proinflammatory NF-kappa-B targets. NF-kappa-B activation in p120-null
keratinocytes was accompanied by alterations in Rho GTPase activity that
appeared to reside upstream from NF-kappa-B activation and downstream
from p120 loss.

606095	TITLE *606095 PEPTIDYL-PROLYL ISOMERASE H; PPIH
;;CYCLOPHILIN H
DESCRIPTION Cyclophilins catalyze the cis-trans isomerization of peptidyl-prolyl
bonds, a rate-limiting step in protein folding. Members of the
cyclophilin family bind the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (CsA)
and share a conserved core domain of approximately 110 amino acids,
called the cyclophilin domain.

CLONING

During purification of a 55-kD protein associated with U4/U6 and
U4/U6.U5 snRNPs, Horowitz et al. (1997) copurified an 18-kD protein. By
database searching, they identified the protein as a novel human
cyclophilin, PPIH, which they named USA-CyP (U-snRNP-associated
cyclophilin). Independently, Teigelkamp et al. (1998) purified PPIH,
which they called SnuCyp-20, as a 20-kD component of the spliceosomal
25S [U4/U6.U5] tri-snRNP complex from HeLa cells. PPIH encodes a deduced
177-amino acid protein that shares 68% and 55% sequence identity with C.
elegans CyP-11 and human cyclophilin A (PPIA; 123840), respectively.
Teigelkamp et al. (1998) demonstrated that purified tri-snRNPs exhibit
peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase activity in vitro, which is
CsA-sensitive, suggesting that PPIH is an active isomerase.

Reidt et al. (2000) determined the crystal structure of PPIH, which
resembles that of PPIA. The active centers of PPIH and PPIA, as well as
most residues involved in PPIA/CsA binding, superimpose almost
perfectly.

Using immunofluorescence microscopy, Teigelkamp et al. (1998)
demonstrated that PPIH colocalizes with snRNP-containing structures
known as nuclear speckles.

Horowitz et al. (1997) demonstrated that PPIH forms a stable complex
with PRP3 (607301) and PRP4 (607795) in the absence of RNA. Using
fractionation of RNA-free protein complexes dissociated from isolated
tri-snRNPs, Teigelkamp et al. (1998) determined that PPIH is part of a
stable heteromer containing the U4/U6-specific 60-kD (PRP4) and 90-kD
(PRP3) proteins. Using coimmunoprecipitation experiments, they
demonstrated that PPIH specifically interacts with the [U4/U6.U5]
tri-snRNP complex 60-kD component. Teigelkamp et al. (1998) concluded
that PPIH may play a role in the assembly of the tri-snRNP complex
and/or the spliceosome.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PPIH
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP sts-AA025365).

608937	TITLE *608937 SH2B ADAPTOR PROTEIN 1; SH2B1
;;SH2B, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; SH2B;;
KIAA1299
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human fetal brain
cDNA library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned SH2B, which they designated
KIAA1299. The 5-prime UTR contains several repetitive elements, and the
deduced protein contains 730 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA detected moderate
to high expression in all fetal and adult tissues and specific brain
regions examined. Highest expression was detected in adult lung and
ovary.

Using N-terminally truncated murine Jak2 (147796) as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen of a rat adipocyte cDNA library, Rui et al. (1997)
cloned a splice variant of Sh2b that they designated Sh2b-beta. The
deduced 670-amino acid protein contains an SH2 domain in its C-terminal
half. The rat Sh2b-alpha protein contains 757 amino acids and is
identical to Sh2b-beta through the SH2 domain, but the proteins have
different C termini.

Nelms et al. (1999) cloned a variant of mouse SH2b that they designated
Sh2b-gamma. The deduced 682-amino acid protein differs from Sh2b-alpha
and Sh2b-beta only in the C terminus. Northern blot analysis detected
expression in all mouse tissues examined.

Yousaf et al. (2001) compared the 4 mouse Sh2b splice variants.
Differences arise by alternative splicing of the last exons (exons 7, 8,
and 9), resulting in frameshifts and unique C-terminal sequences after
the last common amino acid, gln631. The alpha, beta, gamma, and delta
isoforms contain 756, 670, 682, and 724 amino acids, respectively, and
have apparent molecular masses of about 90, 80, 80, and 85 kD,
respectively. All 4 variants have proline-rich and serine-rich regions,
as well as a PH domain, an SH2 domain, and numerous potential
phosphorylation target motifs. The unique C-terminal domains of the
alpha, gamma, and delta isoforms contain a proline-rich SH3
domain-interacting site. In addition, the delta isoform has 2 consensus
nuclear localization sequences and a third serine-tryptophan-rich
region. Homologs of all 4 mouse Sh2b isoforms are found in human, with
differences in the C terminus following gln631. RT-PCR detected at least
2 Sh2b variants in all mouse tissues examined. Expression of each
variant was tissue specific, and the variants were usually expressed in
pairs of alpha and delta or beta and gamma.

GENE FUNCTION

Rui et al. (1997) found that the C terminus of rat Sh2b-beta, which
contains the SH2 domain, specifically interacted with kinase-active,
tyrosyl-phosphorylated murine Jak2, but not with kinase-inactive,
unphosphorylated Jak2. In a mouse fibroblast cell line, growth hormone
(GH; 139250) stimulated the interaction of Sh3b-beta with
tyrosyl-phosphorylated Jak2 both in vitro and in vivo. GH promoted a
transient and dose-dependent tyrosyl phosphorylation of Sh2b-beta in the
mouse fibroblasts. Sh2b-beta was also tyrosyl phosphorylated in response
to gamma-interferon (147570), a cytokine that activates JAK2 and JAK1
(147795).

Kong et al. (2002) found that mouse Sh2b-beta interacted with Fgfr3
(134934) through its SH2 domain. SH2b-beta was tyrosine phosphorylated
when coexpressed with activated mutants of Fgfr3, and the extent of
Sh2b-beta phosphorylation correlated with the degree of receptor
activation. Overexpression of Sh2b-beta also increased the
phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Stat5b (604260) by
activated Fgfr3.

Nelms et al. (1999) found that mouse Sh2b-gamma interacted specifically
with insulin receptor (147670). The interaction required phosphorylation
within the triple tyrosine motif of the receptor kinase domain.

Yousaf et al. (2001) found that all 4 Sh2b variants were phosphorylated
on tyrosine specifically in response to IGFI (147440) and PDGF (see
190040) stimulation of a mouse fibroblast cell line. Expression of the
cDNAs caused variant-dependent levels of IGFI- and PDGF-induced
mitogenesis. The most pronounced increase in mitogenesis was
consistently observed for the gamma variant, followed by delta, alpha,
and beta with decreasing responses. The mitogenic response to EGF
(131530) was unaffected.

Nelms et al. (1999) determined that the mouse Sh2b gene contains 9
exons. The Sh2b-alpha, -beta, and -gamma splice variants are identical
through exon 6 and most of exon 7, which encodes the core of the SH2
domain. The use of alternate splice sites at the 3-prime end of exon 7
results in the different Sh2b variants.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the SH2B gene
to chromosome 16. By interspecific backcross analysis, Nelms et al.
(1999) mapped the mouse Sh2b gene to the distal arm of chromosome 7.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

SH2B1 is one of the genes disrupted in patients with the 220-kb deletion
of chromosome 16p11.2 (613444). The deletion syndrome is characterized
by obesity and developmental delay.

For a discussion of a possible association between variation in the
SH2B1 gene and obesity, see BMIQ16 (see 613444).

ANIMAL MODEL

Ohtsuka et al. (2002) generated Sh2b-null mice. Both male and female
Sh2b -/- mice showed slight retardation in growth and impaired
fertility. Female knockout mice possessed small, anovulatory ovaries
with reduced numbers of follicles, and male Sh2b -/- mice had small
testes with reduced sperm number. Sh2b -/- cumulus cells did not respond
to either follicle-stimulating hormone (see 136530) or IGF1.

Duan et al. (2004) demonstrated that systemic deletion of the mouse Sh2b
gene severely impaired insulin signaling in skeletal muscle, liver, and
fat. Sh2b -/- mice progressively developed hyperinsulinemia,
hyperglycemia, and glucose intolerance. Duan et al. (2004) concluded
that SH2B is a physiologic enhancer of insulin action and is required
for glucose homeostasis during aging.

Ren et al. (2007) generated Sh2b1-knockout mice that developed
hyperlipidemia, leptin (164160) resistance, hyperphagia, obesity,
hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance.
Neuron-specific restoration of Sh2b1 corrected the metabolic disorders
in the knockout mice and improved leptin signaling and leptin regulation
of orexigenic neuropeptide expression in the hypothalamus.
Neuron-specific overexpression of Sh2b1 dose-dependently protected
against high fat diet-induced leptin resistance and obesity. Ren et al.
(2007) suggested that neuronal SH2B1 regulates energy balance, body
weight, peripheral insulin sensitivity, and glucose homeostasis at least
in part by enhancing hypothalamic leptin sensitivity.

;;CTD NUCLEAR ENVELOPE PHOSPHATASE 1;;
DULLARD, XENOPUS, HOMOLOG OF; DULLARD
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Satow et al. (2002) cloned Xenopus Dullard and, by database analysis,
identified its human homolog. The deduced 261-amino acid human protein
shares 92% identity with Xenopus Dullard, and both have the conserved
C-terminal domain of NLIIF (CTDSP1; 605323). In Xenopus embryos, Dullard
mRNA localized to the animal hemisphere before the gastrula stage. It
was restricted to the neural region as gastrulation proceeded and
subsequently localized to the neural tissues, branchial arches, and
pronephroi at the tail-bud stages.

GENE FUNCTION

By translational knockdown, Satow et al. (2002) found that Dullard was
involved in neural development in Xenopus embryos. Overexpression of
Dullard led to apoptosis in early Xenopus development.

Satow et al. (2006) found that Dullard negatively regulated BMP (see
BMP1; 112264) signaling by promoting ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal
degradation of BMP receptors (see BMPR2; 600799) in Xenopus. Dullard
phosphatase activity was essential for degradation of BMP receptors and
neural induction in Xenopus.

MAPPING

Hartz (2007) mapped the CTDNEP1 (DULLARD) gene to chromosome 17p13.1
based on an alignment of the CTDNEP1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AJ011916)
with the genomic sequence (build 36.1).

;;MAMMAGLOBIN 2; MGB2;;
MAMMAGLOBIN B;;
LACRYGLOBIN;;
LIPOPHILIN C; LPNC
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the secretoglobin family, such as SCGB2A1, are secreted
proteins of about 10 kD that are found in high concentrations in fluids
of lung, lacrimal gland, salivary gland, prostate, uterus, and other
tissues. Secretoglobins form stable dimers prior to secretion (summary
by Jackson et al., 2011).

CLONING

The uteroglobin gene family includes the uteroglobin (UGB; 192020) and
mammaglobin (MGB) genes. By screening a human genomic library with an
MGB gene fragment, Becker et al. (1998) isolated a segment of a novel
gene showing high sequence similarity to MGB. Based on this similarity,
they named the novel gene mammaglobin B, which is also called
mammaglobin-2 (MGB2). The authors isolated a full-length MGB2 cDNA by
RACE PCR using mRNA from a human breast cancer cell line. The predicted
95-amino acid MGB2 protein contains the conserved residues
characteristic of the uteroglobin family. MGB2 shares 58% amino acid
sequence identity with MGB and 23% identity with UGB. Becker et al.
(1998) found that MGB2 is identical to a 68-amino acid peptide of
lacryglobin, a human tear protein identified and sequenced by Molloy et
al. (1997), except that MGB2 contains 18 additional amino acids at the N
terminus and 9 additional amino acids at the C terminus. Becker et al.
(1998) suggested that the 18 N-terminal amino acids are cleaved prior to
secretion from the lacrimal gland and that the 9 amino acids at the C
terminus represent amino acids not identified in the lacryglobin
fragment sequenced. RNA dot blot analysis found MGB2 expression in
normal human breast, uterus, and salivary gland, but not in prostate or
stomach. Northern blot analysis detected MGB2 expression in normal
breast and breast tumor samples, with an apparent overexpression in
tumor samples compared with patient-matched normal samples. Northern
blot analysis of uterus samples showed MGB2 expression in 2 of 8 normal
samples and 2 of 8 tumor samples.

Zhao et al. (1999) cloned SCGB2A1, which they called lipophilin C, from
a human lacrimal gland cDNA library. The deduced 95-amino acid
prelipophilin C protein has a calculated molecular mass of 10.9 kD.
Removal of the N-terminal signal sequence yields a mature 77-amino acid
protein with a predicted molecular mass of 8.9 kD. RT-PCR detected
lipophilin C expression in thymus, prostate, testis, salivary gland,
kidney, trachea, uterus, mammary gland, ovary, and lacrimal gland.
Little to no expression was present in skeletal muscle, small intestine,
spleen, placenta, bone marrow, and leukocytes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Becker et al. (1998) determined that the MGB2 gene contains 3 exons.

MAPPING

By FISH, Becker et al. (1998) mapped the MGB2 gene to 11q13, which is
where the MGB and UGB genes are located. Independently, Zhao et al.
(1999) mapped the SCGB2A1 gene to chromosome 11q12-q13.1 using FISH.

604963	TITLE *604963 PEPTIDOGLYCAN RECOGNITION PROTEIN 1; PGLYRP1
;;PGLYRP; PGRP;;
PGRP, SHORT; PGRPS
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Innate nonself immune recognition relies on structures common among
invading microbes, a process termed pattern recognition. Peptidoglycan
is a fundamental component of the bacterial cell wall and is thus a
candidate for a pattern recognized by the immune system. Using
differential display to identify bacteria-induced genes in the moth
Trichoplusia ni, Kang et al. (1998) cloned a cDNA encoding the T. ni
peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP, or PGLYRP). Recombinant T. ni
PGLYRP bound to peptidoglycan and to gram-positive bacteria. By PCR of
human and mouse spleen cDNAs, they isolated human and mouse PGLYRP
cDNAs, respectively. The deduced human PGLYRP protein has 196 amino
acids. Both the human and mouse PGLYRP proteins share 43% sequence
identity with the T. ni PGLYRP protein. Recombinant mouse Pglyrp protein
expressed in insect cells possessed an affinity for peptidoglycan. Dot
blot analysis of a number of human tissue mRNAs detected strong
expression in bone marrow and weak expression in lung, kidney, liver,
small intestine, spleen, thymus, peripheral leukocyte, and fetal spleen.

Liu et al. (2001) cloned PGLYRP, which they called PGRPS, by PCR of a
bone marrow cDNA library. The deduced 196-amino acid protein contains an
N-terminal signal peptide, followed by the extracellular PGRP domains
III, II, and I, which are highly conserved in mammalian and insect
PGRPs. PGRPS shares 40%, 43%, and 42% amino acid identity with PGRPL
(608199), PGRPI-alpha (PGLYRP3; 608197), and PGRPI-beta (PGLYRP4;
608198). RNA dot blot analysis detected strong PGRPS expression in bone
marrow and expression that was 50 to 100 times lower in
polymorphonuclear leukocytes and fetal liver. Northern blot analysis
detected 1.4-, 0.9-, and 0.5-kb transcripts in bone marrow, a 0.9-kb
transcript in fetal liver, and 1.4- and 0.9-kb transcripts in peripheral
blood leukocytes. PCR detected low expression of PGRPS in spleen,
jejunum, and thymus, possibly due to the presence of polymorphonuclear
leukocytes in these tissues. Transiently transfected COS-7 and human
embryonic kidney cells expressed PGRPS as a protein with an apparent
molecular mass of 24 kD. About half of the expressed PGRPS was detected
in the culture medium, and the remainder was a Triton X-100-soluble
membrane protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Liu et al. (2001) determined that recombinant PGRPS expressed by COS-7
cells and human embryonic kidney cells bound to gram-positive bacteria,
B. subtilis and M. luteus, with high affinity.

Using purified PGLYRP1, PGLYRP3, PGLYRP4, and a PGLYRP3/PGLYRP4
heterodimer, Kashyap et al. (2011) showed that these PGRPs interacted
with the bacterial cell wall and activated bacterial 2-component
systems, resulting in membrane depolarization, cessation of
peptidoglycan, protein, DNA, and RNA synthesis, and production of
hydroxyl radicals to cause bacterial death. Fluorescence microscopy
demonstrated that, in B. subtilis, a gram-positive bacteria, PGRPs
entered the cell wall at the site of daughter cell separation during
cell division and activated the CssR-CssS 2-component system. In E.
coli, a gram-negative bacteria, PGRPs bound the outer membrane and
activated the CpxA-CpxR 2-component system. Kashyap et al. (2011)
excluded other bactericidal mechanisms, including inhibition of
peptidoglycan synthesis, peptidoglycan hydrolysis, and membrane
permeabilization. They concluded that PGRPs are innate immunity proteins
that bind the cell wall or outer membrane and exploit the bacterial
stress response to kill bacteria.

GENE STRUCTURE

Liu et al. (2001) determined that the PGLYRP gene contains 3 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Liu et al. (2001) mapped the PGLYRP gene
to chromosome 19.

602566	TITLE *602566 PURINERGIC RECEPTOR P2X, LIGAND-GATED ION CHANNEL, 7; P2RX7
;;PURINOCEPTOR P2X7; P2X7
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Cell surface ATP receptors can be divided into 2 classes. The
metabotropic class (P2Y/P2U) are members of the 7-transmembrane
superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (see 602451). The ionotropic
class (P2X) are ligand-gated channels (see 600843). P2Z receptors are
ionotropic but also cause cell permeabilization. Rassendren et al.
(1997) cloned the human gene for a receptor, called P2X7, that is
structurally related to the P2X family and exhibits the properties of a
P2Z receptor. They screened a human monocyte cDNA library with the rat
P2X7 gene as a probe, and recovered a cDNA encoding a predicted
595-amino acid protein that is 80% identical to the rat P2X7 protein. On
Northern blots, P2X7 was expressed as a 6-kb mRNA in many tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Rassendren et al. (1997) found that treatment of P2X7-transfected cells
with ATP or 2-prime, 3-prime-(4-benzoyl)-benzoyl ATP (BzATP) elicited
cation-selective currents. Longer applications of agonists permeabilized
the cell.

Worthington et al. (2002) studied the role of various residues in ATP
binding of P2X7 receptor. This was done by transfecting into a cell line
or Xenopus oocytes with either wildtype or site-directed mutants of the
protein. They concluded that K193 and K311 are essential residues in ATP
binding.

Atkinson et al. (2002) demonstrated that the P2RX7 ATP-binding receptor
calcium channel spans the nuclear envelope. Atkinson et al. (2002) used
in situ hybridization of the rat hippocampus to detect mRNA encoding
P2RX7. A positive signal was seen in the cytoplasm of all neurons in the
cell-body layer, 90% of which are excitatory cells. P2RX7 mRNA was also
seen in inhibitory neurons of the hippocampus.

Sugiyama et al. (2004) tested whether diabetes increases the
vulnerability of retinal microvessels to the potentially lethal
consequences of having their P2X7 purinoceptors activated. In
experiments using pericyte-containing microvessels isolated from adult
rat retina, they found that soon after the onset of
streptozotocin-induced diabetes, markedly lower P2X7 agonist
concentrations effectively opened pores and triggered apoptosis in the
retinal microvasculature. Sugiyama et al. (2004) suggested that
microvascular damage in the diabetic retina may be mediated by receptors
for vasoactive molecules.

Using rat alveolar macrophages expressing native P2x7 and human
embryonic kidney cells expressing full-length rat P2x7 or a C-terminally
truncated P2x7 mutant, Lemaire et al. (2006) showed that P2X7 was
involved in the fusion process leading to multinucleated giant cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Buell et al. (1998) determined that the P2RX7 gene contains 13 exons.

MAPPING

By FISH, Buell et al. (1998) localized the P2RX7 gene to chromosome
12q24. By radiation hybrid analysis, they found that the gene lies
within 130 kb of the homologous P2RX4 gene (600846).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Several investigators had shown that P2X7 is nonfunctional both in
lymphocytes and monocytes from some subjects. To study a possible
genetic basis, Gu et al. (2001) sequenced DNA coding for the
carboxyl-terminal tail of P2X7. They found a 1513A-C substitution, which
resulted in a glu496-to-ala (E496A) mutation. Nine of 45 normal subjects
were heterozygous, whereas 1 subject was homozygous. Surface expression
of P2X7 on lymphocytes was not affected by this E496A polymorphism,
demonstrated both by confocal microscopy and immunofluorescent staining.
Monocytes and lymphocytes from the E496A homozygote subject expressed
nonfunctional receptor, whereas heterozygotes showed P2X7 function that
was half that of germline P2X7. Transfection experiments showed that the
mutant P2X7 receptor was nonfunctional when expressed at low receptor
density but regained function at a high receptor density. This density
dependence of mutant P2X7 function was also seen on differentiation of
fresh monocytes to macrophages with interferon-gamma, which upregulated
mutant P2X7 and partially restored its function. P2X7-mediated apoptosis
of lymphocytes was impaired in homozygous mutant P2X7 compared with
germline (8.6 vs 35.2%). The data suggested that the glutamic acid at
position 496 is required for optimal assembly of the P2X7 receptor.

Treatment of mycobacteria-infected macrophages with ATP induces
P2X7-mediated apoptosis that leads to death of the host cell and
intracellular bacilli. Saunders et al. (2003) found that neither
apoptosis nor killing of mycobacteria occurred in macrophages from
individuals homozygous for E496A after brief ATP exposure.

Cabrini et al. (2005) noted that in addition to the E496A variant,
several other polymorphisms cause loss of function of P2X7R in CLL
patients. By monitoring ATP-induced Ca(2+) influx in peripheral blood
lymphocytes from CLL patients and in embryonic kidney cells transfected
with P2X7R variants, they confirmed loss of function with E496A, but
found that other cytoplasmic tail variants resulted in only minor
functional decreases. Cabrini et al. (2005) identified the 489C-T
polymorphism, which causes a his155-to-tyr (H155Y) change in the
extracellular portion of the receptor, as a gain-of-function
polymorphism. Significant Ca(2+) flux increase was observed in CLL
patient lymphocytes bearing 489C/T and 489T/T genotypes. None of the
polymorphisms studied occurred at a significantly different frequency in
CLL patients compared with controls.

Wiley et al. (2002) investigated whether a glu496-to-ala (E496A;
1513A-C) single-nucleotide polymorphism that results in loss of function
of P2X7 in healthy individuals was present in leukemic B lymphocytes of
patients with chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL; 151400). They studied
genomic DNA from the peripheral blood leukocytes of 36 unrelated
individuals with CLL, 4 individuals with familial CLL, and 46
age-matched controls. The prevalence of the polymorphic mutation and the
frequency of the mutant allele were 3-fold greater in individuals with
CLL than in white, elderly controls. Individuals homozygous for the
polymorphic allele had no P2X7 receptor function and heterozygotes had
half the normal function of that seen in individuals homozygous for the
wildtype allele; amounts of ATP-induced apoptosis varied accordingly. In
2 families in which Wiley et al. (2002) studied a father-son pair and a
sister-sister pair with CLL, loss of P2X7 function arose because of
inheritance of 1 or 2 1513A-C alleles for P2X7. They concluded that
activation of the P2X7 receptor leads to apoptosis of lymphocytes in
individuals with CLL, and reduced function of this receptor has an
antiapoptotic effect, resulting in an increase in B-cell numbers. Thus,
inheritance of a loss-of-function polymorphic mutation at position 1513
in the P2X7 gene would contribute to the pathogenesis of CLL.

To explore further the involvement of P2X7 as a susceptibility gene in
CLL, Dao-Ung et al. (2004) expanded the study of Wiley et al. (2002) to
include 42 cases of familial and 74 cases of sporadic CLL. Three
intergenerational pairs, 6 sib pairs, and 8 single familial cases
(affected relatives unavailable for study) were recruited. The 1513C
allele frequency was significantly increased in familial CLL patients
(0.286) compared with normal subjects (0.157) (OR = 2.1, p = 0.008). In
contrast, the 1513C allele frequency in patients with sporadic CLL was
very similar to that observed in normal subjects, with an OR close to 1.

Thunberg et al. (2002) found that the 1513A-C polymorphism affected
clinical outcome in CLL, especially in patients with mutated
immunoglobulin heavy chain variable genes (V(H); see 147070). Survival
was significantly longer for patients with CLL heterozygous for the
1513C allele than those with the 1513A/A genotype: median survival was
104 months and 72 months, respectively (P = 0.009). Of the 165 patients
with CLL in whom they assessed V(H) gene mutation status, the genes were
mutated in 71 (43%) patients and unmutated in 94; 18 (25%) of the 71
patients with mutated genes had the 1513C allele, compared with 17 (18%)
of the 94 who had unmutated genes. In patients with mutated
immunoglobulin heavy chain variable genes, those with CLL who were
1513C-positive had 53 months' longer median survival than those with the
1513A/A genotype (151 vs 98 months, P = 0.011). Di Virgilio and Wiley
(2002) commented on these findings.

ANIMAL MODEL

Solle et al. (2001) generated P2rx7-deficient mice by homologous
recombination. Macrophages from the mutant mice were unable to respond
to extracellular ATP as measured by fluorescent dye accumulation. In
addition, ATP or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation of macrophages
resulted in the accumulation of 35-kD pro-Il1b (147720) in amounts
comparable to wildtype, but only wildtype macrophages secreted the 17-kD
Il1b. Both wildtype and mutant macrophages produced and released the
17-kD form in response to the potassium ionophore nigericin. Likewise,
in vivo, mutant mice primed with LPS and challenged with ATP failed to
generate significant levels of Il1b. Il6 (147620), on the other hand,
was produced by the mutant mice in response to LPS but without
additional production after ATP challenge, suggesting that ATP affects
IL6 production via both P2RX7-dependent and -independent mechanisms.

The capacity of P2X7R to form large pores and mediate apoptosis depends
on its large cytoplasmic tail, which harbors a putative TNFR-related
death domain. Adriouch et al. (2002) stated that transfected mouse P2x7r
forms pores less efficiently than its human and rat counterparts. Using
flow cytometric analysis, they demonstrated that splenic T cells from
C57BL/6 mice were less sensitive to extracellular ATP-induced calcium
uptake and apoptosis than were those from BALB/c mice. Adriouch et al.
(2002) identified a coding mutation in the C57BL/6 allele, a T-to-C
transition at nucleotide 1352, that led to a pro451-to-leu (P451L)
substitution in the TNFR-related death domain. In contrast, the BALB/c
sequence was in accord with those of human and rat P2X7R. The mutant
form of P2x7r was present in 2 C57BL and 2 DBA strains, but not in 10
other strains examined, including 4 derived from wild mice. Adriouch et
al. (2002) suggested that the P451L mutation has effects analogous to
those seen with the human E496A mutation.

Weber et al. (2010) found that P2x7 -/- mice were resistant to contact
hypersensitivity (CHS). Injection of Il1b restored the capacity to
develop CHS in P2x7 -/- mice. P2x7 -/- dendritic cells failed to make
Il1b in response to LPS and ATP, but they did make Il1b, in an Nlrp3
(606416)- and Asc (PYCARD; 606838)-dependent manner, if primed with LPS
and alum. Weber et al. (2010) concluded that P2X7 is a crucial receptor
for extracellular ATP released in skin in response to contact allergens
and for the release of IL1B, which is also essential in the
sensitization process.

;;KIAA0375;;
IPORIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones from a size-fractionated brain cDNA library, Nagase
et al. (1997) cloned a partial RUSC2 cDNA, which they called KIAA0375.
RT-PCR detected high expression in human kidney, ovary, and testis,
followed by moderate expression in brain, placenta, lung, liver, and
skeletal muscle, and low expression in prostate and small intestine.

By yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human placental cDNA library with mutant
Rab1b (612565) as prey, Bayer et al. (2005) identified RUSC2, which they
called iporin. The deduced 1516-amino acid protein contains a RUN domain
and an SH3 domain, as well as proline and glutamic acid-rich regions.
The mouse homolog shares 84% similarity to human RUSC2. Northern blot
analysis of human tissues detected ubiquitous expression of a 5.5-kb
transcript, with highest levels in brain and testis. The RUN domain of
RUSC2 mediated binding to Rab1. Western blot analysis detected a 220-kD
protein mainly associated with membrane fractions. Immunofluorescence
microscopy showed a cytosolic distribution with punctate perinuclear
enrichment. RUSC2 interacted with the Rab1-binding protein GM130
(GOLGA2; 602580) on yeast 2-hybrid and in vitro binding assays.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bayer et al., 2005 determined that the RUSC2 gene contains 11 exons and
spans about 14 kb.

MAPPING

Bayer et al. (2005) noted that the RUSC2 gene maps to chromosome 9p13.1.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing a region of chromosome 18 that contains a segment deleted
in the Ma29 lung cancer cell line, followed by screening a brain cDNA
library, Yanaihara et al. (2001) cloned B29. B29 is located outside the
Ma29 deletion. The deduced B29 protein contains 248 amino acids.
Yanaihara et al. (2001) also identified 3 minor isoforms that differ in
the reading frame utilized and in the presence or absence of exon 3
and/or exon 6. Expression levels were below the limit of detection for
Northern blot analysis, but RT-PCR found near ubiquitous expression.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yanaihara et al. (2001) determined that the B29 gene contains 8 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Yanaihara et al. (2001) mapped the B29
gene to chromosome 18q21.

;;SCOTIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Zhang et al. (2000) cloned a cDNA encoding Scotin, which they called
HSPC217, from CD34 (142230)-positive hematopoietic stem/progenitor
cells. The deduced 170-amino acid protein contains an MYB (189990)
DNA-binding domain repeat signature. Microarray analysis of 5
hematopoietic cell lines detected low-level expression of Scotin in NB4
and Jurkat cells, but no expression was detected in HL60, K562, and U937
cells.

Bourdon et al. (2002) identified mouse Scotin by differential display of
spleen and thymus of normal and p53 (191170) null mice after gamma
irradiation of whole animals. The induced 1.85-kb transcript encodes a
deduced 235-amino acid protein. By searching an EST database using the
mouse sequence as probe, followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE, Bourdon
et al. (2002) cloned a full-length cDNA encoding Scotin from a placenta
cDNA library. The deduced 240-amino acid human protein shares 70%
identity with mouse Scotin. Both the human and the mouse proteins
contain an N-terminal signal sequence, a central transmembrane domain
composed of 18 hydrophobic amino acids, and a proline/tyrosine domain,
and both show an apparent molecular mass of 25 kD by Western blot
analysis. Immunolocalization of exogenously expressed Scotin revealed
colocalization with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) markers. By mutation
analysis, Bourdon et al. (2002) determined that the proline-rich domain
is required for ER localization.

GENE FUNCTION

Bourdon et al. (2002) noted that mouse thymus and spleen cells underwent
massive p53-dependent apoptosis following ultraviolet irradiation or
exposure to actinomycin D. They found that Scotin mRNA was induced
coincident with apoptosis and was expressed only in spleen and thymus of
irradiated wildtype mice and not in the spleen or thymus of irradiated
p53 null mice. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, they
confirmed direct binding between p53 and Scotin, and using a luciferase
reporter plasmid driven by the mouse Scotin promoter, they confirmed
dose-dependent p53 transactiviation. Furthermore, Bourdon et al. (2002)
showed that the apoptosis induced by the p53/Scotin pathway is caspase
dependent.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Bourdon et al. (2002) determined that the
human Scotin gene contains 6 exons. They identified a p53-responsive
element of 9 decamers within the mouse Scotin promoter.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Zhang et al. (2000) mapped the human
Scotin gene to chromosome 3. By genomic sequence analysis, Bourdon et
al. (2002) mapped the Scotin gene to chromosome 3p21.3. They also
identified a Scotin pseudogene on chromosome Xq13.1-q13.3.

IKAROS/BCL6 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Ikaros proteins are lymphoid-restricted zinc finger transcription
factors that are considered master regulators of lymphocyte
differentiation. Klug et al. (1998) noted that there are at least 8
alternatively spliced transcripts of the Ikaros gene that encode
isoforms with common N-terminal and C-terminal domains. By screening a
Jurkat T-cell cDNA library with a mouse Ikaros cDNA, Molnar et al.
(1996) isolated human Ikaros cDNAs. The deduced human and mouse Ikaros
proteins are 95% identical. RT-PCR of human thymus and peripheral blood
leukocyte mRNAs detected 6 Ikaros splicing variants which were expressed
at similar levels and ratios as the corresponding mouse leukocyte Ikaros
transcripts. The authors found that Ikaros proteins are conserved in
sequence composition and relative expression between human T cells and
mouse thymocytes. Northern blot analysis demonstrated the expression of
7.5- and 4.5-kb Ikaros transcripts in human thymus, spleen, and
peripheral blood leukocytes.

By PCR using primers based on a conserved nucleotide sequence of various
zinc finger proteins, Nietfeld and Meyerhans (1996) cloned human bone
marrow cDNAs encoding Ikaros, which they designated IK1. The deduced
519-amino acid protein is 93% identical to the mouse Ikaros isoform
1/LyF1 isoform VI and contains 4 N-terminal and 2 C-terminal zinc finger
domains. The authors detected 3 human mRNA species by Northern blot
analysis: a 4.4-kb transcript, which was prominent in peripheral blood
leukocytes; a 6.0-kb transcript, which was strongly expressed in spleen,
thymus, lymph node, and bone marrow; and a 7.0-kb transcript. They
stated that the human and mouse Ikaros genes have similar overall
transcription patterns.

Dijon et al. (2008) stated that the N-terminal Kruppel-like zinc finger
domain of Ikaros proteins is involved in DNA binding, while the
C-terminal zinc finger domain mediates homo- or heterodimerization with
other Ikaros proteins. Alternative splicing of exons 3 to 6 produces
Ikaros isoforms with 0 to 4 N-terminal zinc fingers, and those with at
least 3 efficiently bind DNA. The DNA-binding Ikaros isoforms include
IK1, IK2, IK3, and IKX, and IK4 can bind DNA on palindromic sequences.
IK5, IK6, IK7, and IK8 are considered dominant-negative isoforms due to
their capacity to bind other isoforms and their inefficiency in binding
DNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Harker et al. (2002) showed that Ikaros may play an important role in
CD4 (186940) versus CD8 (see CD8A; 186910) lineage commitment decisions
by demonstrating: (1) that it binds to regulatory elements in the
endogenous CD8A locus in vivo using thymocyte chromatin
immunoprecipitations; (2) that Ikaros suppresses position effect
variegation of transgenes driven by CD8 regulatory elements; and (3)
that mice with reduced levels of Ikaros and Aiolos (606221) show an
apparent increase in CD4 populations with immature phenotype, i.e.,
cells that fail to activate the CD8A gene. The authors proposed that
Ikaros family members function as activators of the CD8A gene and that
their associated activities are critical for appropriate chromatin
remodeling transitions during thymocyte differentiation and lineage
commitment.

Ezzat et al. (2005) demonstrated that Ikaros is expressed in the
hormone-producing pituitary corticomelanotroph cells of mice, where it
binds the proopiomelanocortin promoter and regulates endogenous gene
expression. Ikaros-null mice had contraction of the pituitary
corticomelanotroph population, reduced circulating adrenocorticotrophic
hormone levels, and adrenal glucocorticoid insufficiency. Hematopoietic
reconstitution failed to correct this hormonal deficit, but the
phenotype of reduced body weight and diminished survival was rescued by
systemic glucocorticoid-hormone administration. Ezzat et al. (2005)
concluded that Ikaros plays a role in orchestrating immune-endocrine
development and function.

Yap et al. (2005) identified Ikaros-binding elements in the 5-prime
flanking regions of pufferfish, mouse, and human STAT4 (600558).
Transactivation, electrophoretic mobility shift, and RNA interference
analyses showed that Ikaros bound to the STAT4 promoter and was involved
in regulation of STAT4 in human T cells.

Dijon et al. (2008) found that purified CD34 (142230)-positive human
cord blood cells and adult peripheral blood cells that were cultured
under erythroid conditions expressed the DNA-binding Ikaros isoforms IK1
through IK4, but not the dominant-negative isoform IK6.
Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that expression of IK6 in these
cells resulted in complex formation between IK6 and IK1, and IK6
decreased cell number and increased cell death. IK6 overexpression
disturbed erythroid differentiation and expression of erythroid-specific
genes, although it had no effect on Ikaros expression, and favored
myelopoiesis by promoting expression of myeloid-specific genes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Dijon et al. (2008) stated that the IKZF1 gene contains 7 translated
exons.

MAPPING

Using somatic cell hybrid DNAs, Molnar et al. (1996) mapped the human
Ikaros gene to 7p13-p11.1, near the EGFR gene (131550). They mapped the
mouse Ikaros gene to chromosome 11 by interspecific backcross analysis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Ikaros is required for normal lymphocyte development. Germline mutant
mice that express only non-DNA-binding dominant-negative 'leukemogenic'
Ikaros isoforms lacking critical N-terminal zinc fingers develop an
aggressive form of lymphoblastic leukemia 3 to 6 months after birth (see
'Animal Model' below). These facts prompted Sun et al. (1999) to seek
molecular abnormalities involving the Ikaros gene in acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL2; 613067) in infants. In leukemic cells from 12 ALL
infants less than 1 year of age, Sun et al. (1999) found high-level
expression of dominant-negative isoforms of Ikaros with abnormal
subcellular compartmentalization patterns. PCR cloning and nucleotide
sequencing were used to identify the specific Ikaros isoforms and detect
Ikaros gene mutations in these cells. Leukemic cells from 7 of 7 infants
with ALL, including 5 of 5 MLL-AF4-positive (159557) infants, expressed
dominant-negative Ikaros isoforms IK4, IK7, and IK8 that lack critical
N-terminal zinc fingers. In 6 of 7 patients, Sun et al. (1999) detected
an in-frame deletion of 10 amino acids (KSSMPQKFLG) upstream of the
transcription-activation domain adjacent to the C-terminal zinc fingers
of IK2, IK4, IK7, and IK8. In contrast, only wildtype IK1 and IK2
isoforms with normal nuclear localization were found in normal infant
bone marrow cells and infant thymocytes. These results implicated the
expression of dominant-negative Ikaros isoforms and the disruption of
normal Ikaros function in the leukemogenesis of ALL in infants.

Nakase et al. (2000) found overexpression of the dominant-negative IK6
isoform in 14 of 41 B-cell patients with adult B-cell ALL. None of the
other dominant-negative isoforms of the Ikaros gene were detected by
RT-PCR analysis. Southern blot analysis with PstI digestion revealed
that those patients with the dominant-negative IK6 isoform might have
small mutations in the Ikaros locus. The results suggested that Ikaros
plays a key role in human B-cell malignancies through the
dominant-negative isoform IK6.

Using RT-PCR to detect Ikaros isoforms with the 30-base deletion in exon
6, Payne et al. (2001) showed that transcripts for IK1 and IK1 with the
deletion were present in normal cord blood and bone marrow, as well as
in 3 ALL cell lines. In addition, they identified an isoform, IKX, that
was identical to IK3 except that it included exon 6; IKX was generated
from a novel exon combination with and without the 30-base deletion.
Payne et al. (2001) detected multiple DNA-binding and nonbinding
isoforms with a 60-base insertion linked to leukemia expressed at the
RNA level in normal hemopoietic cells. Immunoblot analysis indicated
that the predominant isoform in normal cells is IKX, while the
predominant form in leukemic cells is IK1.

In a genomewide analysis of leukemic cells from 242 pediatric ALL
patients using high resolution, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
arrays and genomic DNA sequencing, Mullighan et al. (2007) identified
mutations in genes encoding principal regulators of B-lymphocyte
development and differentiation in 40% of B-progenitor ALL cases.
Deletions were detected in IKZF1, IKZF3 (606221),TCF3 (147141), EBF1
(164343), and LEF1 (153245). The PAX5 (167414) gene was the most
frequent target of somatic mutation, being altered in 31.7% of cases.

The Philadelphia chromosome, a chromosomal abnormality that encodes
BCR-ABL1 (see 151410, 189980), is the defining lesion of chronic
myelogenous leukemia (CML) and a subset of acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(ALL). To define oncogenic lesions that cooperate with BCR-ABL1 to
induce ALL, Mullighan et al. (2008) performed a genomewide analysis of
diagnostic leukemia samples from 304 individuals with ALL, including 43
BCR-ABL1 B-progenitor ALLs and 23 CML cases. IKZF1, encoding the
transcription factor Ikaros, was deleted in 83.7% of BCR-ABL1 ALL, but
not in chronic phase CML. Deletion of IKZF1 was also identified as an
acquired lesion at the time of transformation of CML to ALL (lymphoid
blast crisis). The IKZF1 deletions resulted in haploinsufficiency,
expression of a dominant-negative Ikaros isoform, or the complete loss
of Ikaros expression. Sequencing of IKZF1 deletion breakpoints suggested
that aberrant RAG-mediated recombination (see 179615) is responsible for
the deletions. Mullighan et al. (2008) concluded that genetic lesions
resulting in the loss of Ikaros function are an important event in the
development of BCR-ABL1 ALL.

Mullighan et al. (2009) identified deletions involving the IKZF1 gene in
leukemic cells of 63 (28.6%) of 221 children with B-cell acute
lymphoblastic leukemia. Cells from 20 patients had a deletion of coding
exons 3 through 6, resulting in the expression of a dominant-negative
form of IKZF1. IKZF1 deletions were associated with an increased risk of
relapse and adverse effects in the original cohort and in an independent
cohort of 258 patients (p values ranging from less than 0.001 to 0.004).

For a discussion of a possible association between variation in the
IKZF1 gene and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, see ALL2 (613067).

CYTOGENETICS

The BCL6 gene (109565), isolated from the breakpoints of 3q27-associated
chromosomal translocations, is implicated in diffuse large B-cell
lymphomas (DLBL). Hosokawa et al. (2000) described the molecular
characterization of novel t(3;7)(q27;p12) translocations in 2 patients
with DLBL. Molecular genetic analysis of the breakpoint area involving
BCL6 revealed the presence of the Ikaros gene. As a molecular
consequence of the translocation, the 5-prime regulatory region of BCL6
was replaced by the putative 5-prime regulatory region of the Ikaros
gene, probably leading to deregulated expression of the BCL6 gene
throughout B-cell differentiation. RT-PCR and FISH analyses of a patient
sample established that the translocation resulted in fusion of the
Ikaros and BCL6 genes. The clinical features of the 2 patients with DLBL
and t(3;7)(q27;p12) translocations were reported by Ichinohasama et al.
(1998).

ANIMAL MODEL

Mice homozygous for a germline mutation in the Ikaros DNA-binding domain
lack not only T and B lymphocytes and natural killer cells, but also
their earliest defined progenitors (Georgopoulos et al., 1994). In
contrast, the erythroid and myeloid lineages are intact in these mutant
mice. Klug et al. (1998) showed that the DNA-binding isoforms of mouse
Ikaros are localized in the nucleus of the most primitive hematopoietic
stem cell subset. They found that Ikaros localizes to heterochromatin in
Abelson-transformed pre-B lymphocytes. Changes in the RNA splicing
pattern of Ikaros occurred at 2 stages of lymphoid differentiation.

O'Neill et al. (1999, 2000) described the structure of a chromatin
remodeling complex associated with Ikaros that is present only in adult
hematopoietic cells. This complex binds to Ikaros-like DNA-binding
sites, including a long polypyrimidine-rich sequence upstream of the
human delta-globin gene (142000), and was thus called PYR complex.
Deletion of this sequence in a human beta locus-containing cosmid
(carrying sequences from the human gamma-A gene, 142200, through the
adult beta-globin gene, 141900) in transgenic mice resulted in delayed
switching from gamma-globin to beta-globin. Lopez et al. (2002) showed
that homozygous Ikaros-null mice lacked the PYR complex, demonstrating a
requirement for Ikaros in the formation of the complex on DNA.
Heterozygous Ikaros-null mice had about half as much PYR complex,
indicating a dosage effect for both Ikaros and PYR complex. They also
showed that Ikaros-null mice had multiple hematopoietic cell defects,
including anemia and megakaryocytic abnormalities, in addition to
lymphoid and stem cell defects. The null mice also had a delay in murine
embryonic-to-adult beta-globin switching and a delay in human
gamma-to-beta switching, consistent with the suggested role for PYR
complex in this process. Lastly, cDNA array analyses indicated that
several hematopoietic cell-specific genes in all blood lineages were
either up- or downregulated in 14-day embryos from Ikaros-null mice
compared with wildtype mice. These results indicated that Ikaros and PYR
complex function together in vivo at many adult hematopoietic
cell-specific genes and at intergenic sites, affecting their expression
and leading to pleiotropic hematopoietic defects.

Plasmacytoid dendritic cells are specialized dendritic cells that
produce high levels of type I interferon (see IFNA1; 147660) upon viral
infection. Allman et al. (2006) showed that mice expressing low levels
of Ikaros lacked peripheral plasmacytoid dendritic cells but not other
dendritic cell subsets. Loss of plasmacytoid dendritic cells was
associated with inability to produce type I interferon after challenge
with Tlr7 (300365) or Tlr9 (605474) ligands or murine cytomegalovirus.
Conventional dendritic cells were present in normal numbers and
exhibited normal responses to in vivo challenge with murine
cytomegalovirus or inactivated toxoplasma antigen.

;;KIAA0013
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated immature myeloid
leukemia cell line cDNA library, Nomura et al. (1994) cloned ARHGAP11A,
which they designated KIAA0013. The cDNA contains a repetitive element
at its 3-prime end, and the deduced 1,023-amino acid protein has a
rhoGAP domain and a putative tyrosine phosphorylation site. Northern
blot analysis detected highest expression in thymus, intermediate
expression in placenta, kidney, testis, and colon, weak expression in
heart, brain, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, pancreas, spleen, ovary,
small intestine, and peripheral blood leukocytes, and none in prostate.

Nomura et al. (1994) presented sequence features, including
hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity and regions of similarity to other known
genes, of genes identified by Nomura et al. (1994).

MAPPING

By PCR of a panel of human-rodent hybrid cell lines, Nomura et al.
(1994) mapped the ARHGAP11A gene to chromosome 15.

;;MCH4
CASPASE 10, ISOFORM B, INCLUDED; CASP10B, INCLUDED;;
FADD-LIKE ICE 2, INCLUDED; FLICE2, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Caspase-10 is an aspartate-specific cysteine protease of the ICE/CED3
(see 147678) family. These proteases take part in a cascade of reactions
thought to be responsible for the apoptotic changes observed in
mammalian cells undergoing programmed cell death.

CLONING

Fernandes-Alnemri et al. (1996) used degenerate PCR to identify CASP10,
a novel member of the ICE/CED3 protease family. They subsequently cloned
the cDNA, which they termed MCH4, from a human Jurkat T-cell cDNA
library. Sequence analysis revealed that MCH4 encodes a 479-amino acid
polypeptide. They found that MCH4 is most closely related to MCH5
(CASP8; 601763) and that MCH4 and MCH5 contain the active site
pentapeptide QACQG instead of the QACRG present in all other known
members of the family. Furthermore, the authors found that the sequences
of MCH4 and MCH5 contain Fas-associating protein with death domain
(FADD; 602457)-like domains, suggesting possible interaction with FADD.
Northern blot analysis showed that MCH4 was expressed as a 4-kb message
in most human tissues examined.

By searching an EST database for clones containing the conserved GSW
sequences found in the small catalytic subunit of caspases, Vincenz and
Dixit (1997) identified a cDNA encoding a splice variant of CASP10,
CASP10B, which they called FLICE2. Sequence analysis predicted that the
deduced 521-amino acid FLICE2 protein contains a 50-amino acid insert in
the C terminus of the prodomain and a 48-amino acid sequence distinct
from CASP10 at the C terminus. FLICE2 also contains 2 death effector
domains (DEDs). Northern blot analysis detected a 4.4-kb FLICE2
transcript particularly in tissues enriched in lymphoid cells and in the
K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line.

GENE FUNCTION

Fernandes-Alnemri et al. (1996) stated that MCH4, like other members of
the ICE/CED3 family, forms an active protease only after cleavage of its
proenzyme into 2 subunits which dimerize to form the active enzyme. They
found that the mature enzyme cleaves both CPP32 (CASP3; 600636) and MCH3
(601761) proenzymes into their mature forms.

Functional analysis by Vincenz and Dixit (1997) showed that FLICE2
cleaves poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP; 173870) to its 85-kD
apoptotic form, binds FADD through the DEDs of each molecule, and binds
to the CD95 (TNFRSF6, or FAS; 134637) and TNFR1 (191190) death
receptors. The binding of CD95 and TNFR1 by FLICE2 is enhanced in the
presence of FADD. Overexpression of FLICE2, but not overexpression of an
active-site mutant, induced apoptosis.

Wang et al. (2001) showed that caspase-10 can function independently of
caspase-8 (CASP8; 601763) in initiating FAS- and tumor necrosis
factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand-receptor-mediated apoptosis.
Moreover, FAS crosslinking in primary human T cells leads to the
recruitment and activation of caspase-10. They showed that the
death-effector domains of caspases 8 and 10 interact with the
death-effector domain of FADD. Nonetheless, they found that caspases 8
and 10 may have different apoptosis substrates and therefore potentially
distinct roles in death receptor signaling or other cellular processes.

Lee et al. (2007) showed that intrinsic apoptosis in human cells that
was induced by the chemotherapeutic agent etoposide or the antibiotic
staurosporine, but not by FAS ligand (TNFSF6; 134638) or TRAIL (TNFSF10;
603598), caused translocation of AK2 (103020) from mitochondria to the
cytoplasm, followed by formation of a complex between AK2, FADD, and
CASP10. Yeast 2-hybrid analysis, protein pull-down assays, and
immunoprecipitation analysis showed that the N- and C-terminal domains
of AK2, which include nucleoside- and substrate-binding domains,
respectively, bound the C-terminal death domain of FADD. AK2 binding
promoted association of CASP10 with FADD, and addition of purified AK2
protein to cell extracts induced activation of CASP10 via FADD, leading
to subsequent activation of CASP9 (602234) and CASP3. Apoptosis through
the AK2 complex did not correlate with the adenylate kinase activity of
AK2, did not require CASP8-mediated apoptotic responses, and did not
involve mitochondrial cytochrome c release. Immunodepletion or knockdown
of AK2, FADD, or CASP10 abrogated etoposide-induced apoptosis, and AK2
complexes were not observed in several etoposide-resistant human tumor
cell lines that were deficient in expression of FADD, CASP10, or CASP3.
In contrast to the findings in human cells, etoposide-induced apoptosis
was observed in mouse embryonic fibroblasts that lacked Fadd expression.
Since mice also lack Casp10, Lee et al. (2007) concluded that mice lack
an apoptotic pathway comparable to the AK2-FADD-CASP10 pathway in
humans.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hadano et al. (2001) determined that the CASP10 gene contains 11 exons
and spans about 48 kb. It is transcribed in the centromere-to-telomere
direction.

MAPPING

Fernandes-Alnemri et al. (1996) mapped the MCH4 gene to 2q33-q34 by
FISH. Hadano et al. (2001) determined that the CFLAR (603599), CASP10,
and CASP8 genes are tandemly located within 200 kb.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome type IIA

In an African American girl with type IIA autoimmune lymphoproliferative
syndrome (ALPS2A; 603909) characterized by abnormal lymphocyte and
dendritic cell homeostasis and immune regulatory defects, Wang et al.
(1999) identified a heterozygous mutation in the CASP10 gene (L285F;
601762.0001). The mutation resulted in decreased caspase activity and
interfered with death receptor-induced apoptosis, particularly that
stimulated by Fas ligand (134638) and TRAIL (603598). These results
provided evidence that inherited nonlethal caspase abnormalities cause
pleiotropic apoptosis defects underlying autoimmunity in ALPS2. A second
patient, of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, was reported to have a homozygous
substitution in the CASP10 gene (V410I), which was later determined to
be a polymorphism with apoptotic activity similar to the wildtype CASP10
protein (Gronbaek et al., 2000; Zhu et al., 2006). In addition, the
Ashkenazi Jewish patient was found to have a mutation in the TNFRSF1A
gene (191190), which is mutated in the TNF receptor-associated periodic
syndrome (TRAPS; 142680) (Zhu et al., 2006). Zhu et al. (2006) presented
association data suggesting that the V410I substitution may offer some
protection from severe disease in patients with ALPS1A (601859) who have
mutations in the TNFRSF6 gene (134637).

In 2 sisters and an unrelated boy with APLS2A, Zhu et al. (2006)
identified a heterozygous pathogenic mutation in the CASP10 gene (I406L;
601762.0007).

- Cancer

To explore the possibility that mutation in the CASP10 gene might be
involved in the development of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL; 605027), Shin
et al. (2002) analyzed the entire coding region and all splice sites of
the CASP10 gene for the detection of somatic mutations in 117 human
NHLs. Seventeen NHLs (14.5%) had CASP10 mutations, of which 3 were
identified in the coding regions of the prodomain, 11 in the p17 large
protease subunit, and 3 in the p12 small protease subunit. There were 2
frameshift mutations and 1 nonsense mutation; the remaining 14 were
missense mutations. Shin et al. (2002) expressed the tumor-derived
CASP10 mutants in 293 cells and found that apoptosis was suppressed.
These data suggested that the inactivating mutations of the CASP10 gene
may lead to the loss of its apoptotic function and contribute to the
pathogenesis of some human NHLs.

Park et al. (2002) analyzed the genetic alterations of the entire coding
region and all splice sites of the CASP8 and CASP10 genes in 99 gastric
cancers by PCR-SSCP and sequencing. Of the 99 gastric cancers, 3 had
CASP10 mutations, whereas no mutations were detected in CASP8. In vitro
expression studies showed that the met147-to-thr (M147T; 601762.0006)
and gln257-to-ter (Q257X; 601762.0004) mutants severely impaired
CASP10-mediated apoptosis. Park et al. (2002) suggested that somatic
alterations of the CASP10 gene may contribute to pathogenesis in a
subset of gastric cancers through loss of apoptotic function.

In an African American patient with ALPS2A (603909), Wang et al. (1999)
identified a heterozygous 724C-T transition in the CASP10 gene,
resulting in a leu242-to-phe (L242F) substitution (L285F in the longer
CASP10 isoform). The proband's mother, who exhibited high levels of
autoantibodies to nuclear antigens and defective lymphocyte apoptosis,
also had the mutation. The proband's unaffected father and 2 sisters did
not have the mutation. The mutation was not found in 200 normal
chromosomes or in any patient with ALPS type I (601859).

impaired caspase-10-mediated apoptosis.

Park et al. (2002) identified 3 somatic mutations in the CASP10 gene in
gastric cancers (137215): met147 to thr (M147T), and the previously
described gln257 to ter (Q257X; 601762.0004). By in vitro expression
studies, they showed that the M147T and Q257X mutations severely
impaired caspase-10-mediated apoptosis.

.0007
AUTOIMMUNE LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE SYNDROME, TYPE IIA
CASP10, ILE406LEU

In a 7-year-old boy with ALPS2A (603909), Zhu et al. (2006) identified a
heterozygous 1400A-T transversion in exon 9 of the CASP10 gene,
resulting in an ile406-to-leu (I406L) substitution near the active site
of the protein. Neither parent had a history suggestive of ALPS, but his
father, an adult-onset diabetic, also carried the mutation. The I406L
mutation was also identified in 2 sisters of mixed Jamaican and Guyanese
ancestry who had early-onset ALPS2A. Their mother and a third sister
were mutation carriers and asymptomatic at the time of evaluation, but
showed defective T cell apoptosis in vitro, increased numbers of
double-negative T cells, and positive direct antiglobulin IgG tests and
antithyroid antibodies. In vitro functional expression studies showed
that the I406L mutant protein had defective apoptosis and exerted a
dominant-negative effect when cotransfected with the wildtype protein.
The I406L substitution was not identified in 576 controls.

612027	TITLE *612027 GRP1-ASSOCIATED SCAFFOLD PROTEIN; GRASP
;;TAMALIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Nevrivy et al. (2000) cloned mouse Grasp. The deduced 392-amino acid
protein has an alanine/proline-rich N-terminal region containing an Src
(190090) homology-3 domain-binding site (PxxP), followed by a PDZ domain
and a leucine-rich domain. It shares substantial similarity with
proteins of the MAGUK family (see 606959) and with RGS12 (602512).
RT-PCR detected high expression in mouse brain, moderate expression in
lung and heart, and low expression in kidney, ovary, and embryo.
Epitope-tagged Grasp localized to the plasma membrane of transfected
human embryonic kidney cells.

By searching databases, Kitano et al. (2003) identified orthologs of rat
Grasp, which they called tamalin, in several species, including human.
Human tamalin contains 395 amino acids.

GENE FUNCTION

Using subtractive hybridization, Nevrivy et al. (2000) found that
all-trans retinoic acid upregulated expression of Grasp in a mouse
embryo cell line. Yeast 2-hybrid screening and in vitro pull-down assays
showed that the leucine-rich region of Grasp interacted with the
N-terminal coiled-coil domain of Grp1 (PSCD3; 605081). Grasp also
interacted with the N-terminal coiled-coil domain of cytohesin-2 (PSCD2;
602488) in pull-down assays. In transfected HEK293 cells, Grasp enhanced
Grp1 association with the plasma membrane and also colocalized with
endogenous ADP-ribosylation factors (see ARF1, 103180) at the plasma
membrane. Mutation analysis showed the alanine/proline-rich region
and/or the PDZ domain of Grasp directed membrane localization.

Kitano et al. (2003) showed that rat tamalin interacted with multiple
neuronal proteins through its protein-binding domains. The PDZ domain of
tamalin bound to the PDZ-binding motifs of Sap90/Psd95-associated
protein (DLGAP3; 611413) and tamalin itself, whereas the PDZ-binding
motif of tamalin interacted with the PDZ domain of Sscam (MAGI2;
606382). Tamalin formed a complex with Psd95 (DLG4; 602887) and Mint2
(APBA2; 602712) by mechanisms other than PDZ-mediated interactions.
Tamalin assembled with these proteins in vivo, and the tamalin protein
complex was verified by coimmunoprecipitation of rat brain lysates.
Kitano et al. (2003) concluded that tamalin forms a protein complex with
multiple postsynaptic and protein-trafficking scaffold proteins.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the GRASP
gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP STS-AA024848).

ANIMAL MODEL

Ogawa et al. (2007) obtained tamalin-knockout mice in the expected
mendelian ratio, and these mice were viable and fertile with normal
physical, behavioral, and emotional characteristics. However, tamalin
deficiency reduced both acute and adaptive responses to morphine and
cocaine.

185620	TITLE *185620 SURFEIT 1; SURF1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using mouse Surf1 cDNA as probe, Lennard et al. (1994) cloned human
SURF1 from placenta and HeLa cell cDNA libraries. The deduced 300-amino
acid protein shares 77% identity with mouse Surf1. Although mouse Surf1
is expressed as 3 alternatively spliced transcripts, Lennard et al.
(1994) found evidence for only 1 human SURF1 cDNA by PCR analysis.

Zhu et al. (1998) reported that the SURF1 gene encodes a deduced
300-amino acid protein that shares 25.6% sequence homology with the
yeast SHY1 homolog. Both proteins have a characteristic mitochondrial
targeting sequence in the N terminus and 2 putative conserved
transmembrane domains. Expression of human SURF1 cDNA with a C-terminal
tag in COS-7 cells colocalized SURF1 with a mitochondrial marker.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lennard et al. (1994) found that the major start sites of the SURF1 and
SURF2 (185630) genes are separated by 97 bp, although both genes have
multiple transcription start sites. The intergenic region is expected to
have bidirectional promoter activity, as is found in mouse. This region
lacks a TATA box, but is GC-rich. DNase footprint analysis showed 4
regions that interacted with HeLa cell nuclear factor complexes.

Duhig et al. (1998) stated that the 5-prime end of each of the surfeit
genes, including SURF1, is contained within a CpG island.

MAPPING

The mouse surfeit gene cluster contains 6 closely spaced housekeeping
genes, designated Surf1 to Surf6, unrelated by sequence homology
(Williams et al., 1988; Colombo et al., 1992). No more than 73 basepairs
separate any 2 of the 4 well-characterized surfeit cluster genes. Using
an interspecies backcross, Stubbs et al. (1990) mapped the surfeit and
Hox-5 gene clusters to the proximal portion of mouse chromosome 2. Surf
is close to the protooncogene Abl, near the centromere of mouse
chromosome 2. Williams et al. (1988) found that juxtaposition of 4 of
the genes was conserved in the human surfeit gene cluster.

By methods of nucleic acid hybridization using somatic cell hybrids and
by in situ hybridization, Yon et al. (1989) localized the human surfeit
gene cluster to chromosome bands 9q33-q34. Yon et al. (1993) confirmed
the localization of the surfeit cluster in 9q34 by fluorescence in situ
hybridization and showed that the organization and juxtaposition of the
human surfeit locus genes are the same as in the mouse. Furthermore,
analysis by FISH of metaphase spreads from human chronic myeloid
leukemic cells containing the t(9;22)(q34;q11) translocation involving
the ABL gene (189980) at 9q34.1 and acute nonlymphocytic leukemic cells
containing the t(6;9)(p23;q34) translocation involving the CAN gene
(114350) at 9q34.1 demonstrated that the surfeit cluster is telomeric to
these 2 genes. Yon et al. (1993) commented that tuberous sclerosis-1
(191100) and nail-patella syndrome (NPS1; 161200) are distal to ABL.

EVOLUTION

Colombo et al. (1992) found that tight clustering and juxtaposition of
at least 5 of the surfeit genes, numbered 1 through 5, and their
associated CpG-rich islands are conserved over the 600 million years of
divergent evolution that separates birds and mammals. They suggested
that surfeit represents a different form of gene cluster in which gene
organization may play both a positive and a negative regulatory role in
gene expression, possibly via cis interactions between the closely
spaced genes.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhu et al. (1998) presented data indicating that SURF1 encodes a
putative assembly or maintenance factor which, in humans, appears to be
specific for the cytochrome c oxidase (COX) complex. See MOLECULAR
GENETICS section.

Using antibodies against a recombinant, labeled SURF1 protein in COS-7
cells, Tiranti et al. (1999) demonstrated that the protein is imported
into the mitochondria as a larger 35-kD precursor which is then
processed into the mature 30-kD product by the cleaving off of a
40-amino acid N-terminal leader polypeptide. Western blot analysis
showed that SURF1 is localized in and tightly bound to the inner
mitochondrial membrane. Cell lines with loss-of-function SURF1 mutations
had no detectable protein and no SURF1 transcripts, suggesting severe
mRNA instability. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis experiments on
SURF1 mutant and control cell lines showed that COX assembly in SURF1
mutants was blocked at an early step, most likely before the
incorporation of subunit II in the nascent intermediates composed of
subunit I alone or subunit I plus subunit IV.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Leigh syndrome (256000), also known as infantile subacute necrotizing
encephalopathy (SNE), is a severe neurologic disorder characterized by
bilaterally symmetric necrotic lesions in subcortical brain regions that
is commonly associated with systemic cytochrome c oxidase (COX)
deficiency (220110). COX deficiency is an autosomal recessive trait, and
most patients belong to a single genetic complementation group. Using
microcell-mediated chromosome transfer, Zhu et al. (1998) mapped the
gene defect in COX deficiency to 9q34 by complementation of the
respiratory chain deficiency in patient fibroblasts. SURF1 became a
positional candidate gene. Analysis of SURF1 revealed several mutations,
all of which predicted a truncated protein. The findings suggested a
role for SURF1 in the biogenesis of the COX complex and defined a new
class of gene defects causing human neurodegenerative disease.

In the mapping done by microcell-mediated chromosome transfer, Zhu et
al. (1998) transferred all 22 autosomes and the X chromosome, one at a
time, into a patient fibroblast line, to demonstrate correction of the
metabolic defect by chromosome 9. To refine the map position of the
defective gene on chromosome 9, Zhu et al. (1998) introduced deleted
versions of chromosome 9. The localization was narrowed further by
excluding regions of 9q by use of DNA markers in 2 small families.

Zhu et al. (1998) showed that the COX deficiency could be 'rescued' by
SURF1 cDNA in patient fibroblasts. They suggested that the functional
complementation approach could serve as a paradigm to map and clone
other nuclear genes associated with respiratory chain disorders, such as
mtDNA depletion syndrome (251880) or complex I-deficient Leigh syndrome
(252010).

Tiranti et al. (1998) used complementation assays based on the fusion of
cytochrome c oxidase-negative Leigh disease cell lines with several
rodent/human hybrid cells that had been made rho(0), i.e., deprived of
their own mtDNA by prolonged exposure to high doses of ethidium bromide,
to identify a COX-negative Leigh disease locus. Complementation of the
COX defect was obtained only with rodent/human rho(0) hybrids that
contained human chromosome 9. Linkage analysis restricted the disease
locus to the subtelomeric region of 9q, within the 7-cM interval between
markers D9S1847 and D9S1826. They sought mutations in candidate genes in
the region, including SURF1, the yeast homolog (SHY1) of which encodes a
mitochondrial protein necessary for the maintenance of COX activity and
respiration. Tiranti et al. (1998) found that SURF1 was mutated in the
probands of 9 COX-negative Leigh disease families; in the probands of 6
families, loss-of-function mutations were found on both alleles.

Poyau et al. (2000) studied fibroblasts from 3 patients suffering from
Leigh syndrome associated with cytochrome c oxidase deficiency. Their
mitochondrial DNA was functional and all nuclear COX subunits had normal
sequences. The expression of transcripts encoding mitochondrial and
nuclear COX subunits was normal or slightly increased. Similarly, the
OXA1 (601066) transcript coding for a protein involved in COX assembly
was increased. However, several COX-protein subunits were severely
depressed, indicating deficient COX assembly. Sequence analysis of SURF1
in these 3 patients revealed 7 heterozygous mutations, 6 of which were
new: an insertion, a nonsense mutation, a splicing mutation at intron 7,
and 3 missense mutations. The gly124-to-glu mutation (185620.0012)
changed a gly that is strictly conserved in Surf1 homologs of 12
species.

Pequignot et al. (2001) stated that 30 different mutations in SURF1 had
been reported in 40 unrelated patients. Twenty mutations had been
described only once. The most frequent mutation involved a deletion of
10 bp and an insertion of 2 bp (AT) (185620.0003); this mutation was
found in 12 of 40 patients, and was homozygous in 3 of them. The second
most frequent mutation was a deletion of 2 bp, CT at position 845-846
(185620.0014); this mutation was found in 9 of 40 patients.

In 18 of 24 (75%) patients with COX-deficient LS, Tiranti et al. (1999)
identified 13 different mutations in the SURF1 gene. All of the
mutations, including frameshift, nonsense, and splice site mutations,
were predicted to result in loss of protein function. No missense
mutations were identified. In addition, no SURF1 mutations were found in
6 patients with COX deficiency classified as 'Leigh-like' or in 16
patients with COX deficiency classified as 'non-LS.' Tiranti et al.
(1999) concluded that SURF1 mutations are specifically associated with
LS and that SURF1 is the gene responsible for most of the COX-deficient
cases of LS.

In 3 cases with LS with COX deficiency, Moslemi et al. (2003) identified
4 pathogenic mutations in the SURF1 gene, including 2 novel mutations.
In all cases, the patients' fibroblasts showed reduced COX activity,
which was restored after transfection with normal SURF1 cDNA.

Najmabadi et al. (2011) performed homozygosity mapping followed by exon
enrichment and next-generation sequencing in 136 consanguineous families
(over 90% Iranian and less than 10% Turkish or Arabic) segregating
syndromic or nonsyndromic forms of autosomal recessive intellectual
disability. In family G008, they identified homozygosity for a missense
mutation in the SURF1 gene (185620.0015) in 2 sibs with mild
intellectual disability, ataxia, short stature, and facial dysmorphism,
diagnosed as a mild form of Leigh syndrome. The parents were first
cousins and had 2 healthy children.

ANIMAL MODEL

Agostino et al. (2003) created a constitutive knockout mouse for Surf1
by replacing exons 5 to 7 of Surf1 with a neomycin-resistance (neo)
cassette. Postimplantation embryonic lethality affected 90% of Surf1 -/-
homozygotes; approximately 30% of liveborn animals died within the first
postnatal month, and an additional 15% died within the first 6 months of
life. Significant deficit in muscle strength and motor performance was
observed, without obvious abnormalities in brain morphology or overt
neurologic symptoms. A profound and isolated defect of COX activity in
skeletal muscle and liver was detected, and reduced histochemical
reaction to COX and mitochondrial proliferation in skeletal muscle was
present.

Dell'Agnello et al. (2007) created Surf1 -/- mice by inserting a loxP
sequence in exon 7, which resulted in a truncated Surf1 protein that was
not expressed. These Surf1 -/- mice were born at the expected mendelian
frequency, indicating that the lethality observed in the previous Surf1
-/- mouse model (Agostino et al., 2003) was not caused by ablation of
Surf1 itself, but rather by the presence of the neo cassette or by the
elimination of regulatory elements in the deleted region. The Surf1 -/-
mice created by Dell'Agnello et al. (2007) showed no neurologic or
extraneurologic defects, although they had a mild defect in COX assembly
and activity. Surf1 -/- animals had a prolonged life span and resistance
to the Ca(2+)-dependent excitotoxic activity of kainic acid compared
with wildtype animals. Primary cultures of Surf1 -/- neurons showed
resistance to glutamate toxicity, reduced glutamate-induced increase in
Ca(2+) in both cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments, and reduced
mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake compared with controls. Dell'Agnello et al.
(2007) concluded that the effects of Surf1 ablation on Ca(2+)
homeostasis, and possibly on longevity, may be independent from those on
COX assembly and mitochondrial bioenergetics.

LEIGH SYNDROME DUE TO MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX IV DEFICIENCY
SURF1, 765C-T

In a patient with Leigh syndrome (256000), Zhu et al. (1998) identified
compound heterozygosity for a 765C-T nonsense mutation in exon 7 and a
337+2T-C mutation in the donor splice site of intron 4 (185620.0002) of
the SURF1 gene.

.0002
LEIGH SYNDROME DUE TO MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX IV DEFICIENCY
SURF1, IVS4, T-C, +2

See 185620.0001 and Zhu et al. (1998). The donor splice site mutation
led to deletion of exon 4; this appeared to result from the use of a
cryptic donor sequence (GT) at the 5-prime end of exon 4, which caused
the removal of exon and intron 4 when the wildtype donor consensus
sequence in intron 4 was mutated.

.0003
LEIGH SYNDROME DUE TO MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX IV DEFICIENCY
SURF1, 2-BP INS/10-BP DEL, NT326

In a patient with Leigh syndrome (256000), Zhu et al. (1998) identified
compound heterozygosity for an insertion/deletion mutation in exon 4
(326insATdelTCTGCCAGCC), which created a nonsense codon at the site of
the mutation, and a 2-bp deletion in exon 9 which removed 1 of the 3 CT
repeats between positions 855 and 860. The latter mutation was
designated 855delCT (185620.0004).

Poyau et al. (2000) found the insertion/deletion mutation in compound
heterozygosity with a gly124-to-glu mutation (185620.0012).

SURF1, 1-BP INS, 882T

In a patient with Leigh syndrome (256000), Zhu et al. (1998) found
homozygosity for insertion of a T into a string of Ts, creating a
nonsense codon. The mutation was designated 882insT. This and 4 other
mutations found by Zhu et al. (1998) in cases of Leigh syndrome
predicted a truncated protein product.

resulting in a change from gln to stop at codon 251.

Tiranti et al. (1999) reported monozygotic twin females with Leigh
syndrome as a result of inheritance of this mutation through uniparental
disomy of maternal chromosome 9.

heterozygosity for a splice mutation and a frameshift deletion: 516+2T-G
in exon 5 and deletion of AG after nucleotide 550 in exon 60
(185620.0009).

SURF1, TYR274ASP

In a Japanese patient with Leigh syndrome (256000), Teraoka et al.
(1999) found compound heterozygosity for mutations in the SURF1 gene: a
T-to-G transversion at nucleotide 820, resulting in a tyr274-to-asp
substitution, and a 2-bp deletion at nucleotide 790 (185620.0011). The
patient was the offspring of nonconsanguineous parents. From the age of
10 months, the patient showed neurologic signs and symptoms, starting
with impairment of movement. At the age of 14 months, he could no longer
crawl. At the age of 17 months, his height and weight were far below
normal. At the age of 18 months, tendon reflexes were hypoactive and
intentional tremor of the limbs developed. There were ocular motor
abnormalities, including slow saccades and bilateral internal
strabismus. Respiratory failure gradually developed, necessitating
intermittent assisted ventilation. Magnetic resonance imaging showed
bilateral, symmetric signal increases in basal ganglia, cerebellum
dentate nucleus, and around the aqueduct of the midbrain. Cerebrospinal
fluid lactate and pyruvic acid concentrations were elevated. However,
blood lactate and pyruvic acid concentrations were not elevated. On
muscle biopsy, no mitochondrial alterations were found, and none of the
3 mitochondrial DNA mutations associated with Leigh syndrome was
detected. The enzyme activity of COX was diffusely and severely
decreased in muscle, and no COX activity was demonstrable in blood
vessels, peripheral nerves, and fibroblasts.

See 185620.0010 and Teraoka et al. (1999).

Rahman et al. (2001) described a 2-year-old girl, born of healthy,
consanguineous Bengali parents, who presented with failure to thrive,
global neurodevelopmental regression, and lactic acidosis. MRI of the
brain showed leukodystrophy with involvement of the corticospinal
tracts. There were no basal ganglia necrotic lesions characteristic of
Leigh syndrome. Respiratory chain enzyme assays on biopsied muscle
revealed a severe isolated deficiency of COX (220110). Sequence analysis
of the SURF1 gene showed homozygosity for a 2-bp deletion at nucleotides
790-791. The patient's parents were heterozygotes. The authors suggested
assaying respiratory chain enzymes in patients with leukodystrophy and
lactic acidosis and sequencing SURF1 in patients with isolated COX
deficiency.

Poyau et al. (2000) identified a 385G-A transition in the SURF1 gene
predicted to cause a gly124-to-glu (G124E) amino acid change. The
parents were unrelated. The patient showed normal early motor and
intellectual milestones but developed a progressive neurologic disease
with motor and intellectual regression leading to a fatal
encephalopathy. The patient was a compound heterozygote; the other
allele carried a 2-bp insertion/10-bp deletion (185620.0003).

SURF1, 4-BP INS, 572CCCT

In a 10-year-old boy with an unusually mild clinical course of Leigh
syndrome (256000), Salviati et al. (2004) found compound heterozygosity
for mutations in the SURF1 gene. A 4-bp insertion (CCCT) at nucleotide
572 of exon 6, which was associated with a common polymorphism (573C-G)
on the same allele, caused a predicted premature termination signal 7
codons downstream. The other mutation was a 10-bp deletion/2-bp
insertion in exon 4 (185620.0003). His mother harbored the exon 4
mutation and his father carried the exon 6 mutation. At age 39 months,
the patient had no MRI lesions; at 8 years of age, MRI showed only
brainstem and cerebellar involvement without lesions in the basal
ganglia or subthalamic nuclei. Salviati et al. (2004) concluded that the
spectrum of MRI findings in Leigh syndrome is variable and that SURF1
mutations should be considered in patients with encephalopathy and COX
deficiency even when early MRI findings are negative.

LEIGH SYNDROME DUE TO MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX IV DEFICIENCY
SURF1, 2-BP DEL, 845CT

In 9 of 40 unrelated patients with Leigh syndrome due to cytochrome c
oxidase deficiency (256000), Pequignot et al. (2001) identified a 2-bp
deletion in the SURF1 gene (845delCT).

Bohm et al. (2006) found that the 845delCT mutation was the most common
SURF1 mutation in 47 patients from 35 families with Leigh syndrome and
cytochrome c oxidase deficiency (see 220110) due to SURF1 mutations. The
deletion was present in 89% of independent alleles.

LEIGH SYNDROME DUE TO MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX IV DEFICIENCY
SURF1, TRP227ARG

In family G008, Najmabadi et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for an
A-to-G transition in the SURF1 gene at genomic coordinate Chr9:135209194
(NCBI36), resulting in a trp227-to-arg (W227R) substitution, in 2 sibs
with mild intellectual disability, ataxia, short stature, and facial
dysmorphism, diagnosed as a mild form of Leigh syndrome. The
first-cousin parents were heterozygous for the mutation and had 2
healthy children.

612169	TITLE *612169 Fc FRAGMENT OF IgG, LOW AFFINITY IIc, RECEPTOR FOR; FCGR2C
;;Fc-GAMMA-RIIC;;
FcRIIC;;
CD32C
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

FCGR2C is 1 of 3 genes that encode isoforms of FCGR2, also known as
CD32, a 40-kD glycoprotein that binds IgG with low affinity. FCGR2 is
widely distributed, being expressed on myeloid and lymphoid cells, as
well as nonhematopoietic cells. The FCGR2 isoforms exhibit differences
in ligand binding specificities, and triggering through different
isoforms results in distinct functions. FCGR2C is expressed on
monocytes, macrophages, and polymorphonuclear cells, and it appears to
be the only FCGR2 isoform expressed on natural killer (NK) cells. Due to
an allelic polymorphism, most individuals lack FCGR2C expression,
although some express high levels of FCGR2C capable of triggering
cytotoxicity by NK cells (Metes et al., 1998).

CLONING

Using mouse Fcgr2b2 to probe a placenta cDNA library, Stuart et al.
(1989) cloned human FCGR2C, which they termed FcRIIC. The predicted
323-amino acid protein has an N-terminal signal sequence, followed by a
175-amino acid ectodomain, a transmembrane segment, and a hydrophilic
44-amino acid cytoplasmic domain. The ectodomain of FCGR2C, which
contains evenly spaced cys residues and 3 potential N-glycosylation
sites, is identical to that of FCGR2B (604590) and highly similar to
that of FCGR2A (146790). In contrast, the cytoplasmic domain of FCGR2C
shares little sequence similarity with those of FCGR2A and FCGR2B.
Northern blot analysis detected expression of 2.5- and 1.6-kb FCGR2C
transcripts in macrophages, B cells, and trophoblasts, but not in
fibroblasts or T cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy of transfected
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells showed surface expression of FCGR2C.

By RT-PCR of resting and IL2 (147680)-activated NK cells, Metes et al.
(1998) isolated full-length FCGR2C and 3 FCGR2C splice variants. Two of
the variants encode proteins with truncated cytoplasmic tails, and the
third encodes a putative soluble protein truncated prior to the
transmembrane region. Flow cytometric and immunoprecipitation analyses
showed surface expression of a 40-kD FCGR2C protein on purified NK
cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Metes et al. (1998) determined that the FCGR2C gene contains 7 exons.

MAPPING

Using a BAC library, Su et al. (2002) determined that the FCGR2C gene
maps to chromosome 1q23, telomeric to the FCGR3A gene (146740) and
centromeric to the FCGR3B gene (610665).

GENE FUNCTION

By immunofluorescence analysis of transfected CHO cells, Stuart et al.
(1989) showed that FCGR2C bound heat-aggregated human IgG, but not human
myeloma IgA.

Metes et al. (1998) showed that NK cells expressing FCGR2C mediated
reverse antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.

Breunis et al. (2008) found that, in individuals with a functional
FCGR2C (see MOLECULAR GENETICS), expression of FCGR2C on phagocytes and
NK cells enhanced effector function toward antibody-coated targets.
FCGR2C function was further enhanced under inflammatory conditions,
i.e., in the presence of IL15 (600554) or GMCSF (CSF2; 138960).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Metes et al. (1998) identified an allelic polymorphism within exon 3 of
FCGR2C that resulted in either a functional ORF containing gln13 or a
null allele containing a stop codon at position 13. They found that an
individual homozygous for the ORF allele exhibited a high level of
functional FCGR2C expression on NK cells, whereas an individual
homozygous for the null allele lacked FCGR2C expression on NK cells.
Distribution of the 4 FCGR2C isoforms on NK cells also appeared to be
donor dependent.

Su et al. (2002) found that the FCGR2C functional allele (202C) and the
FCGR2C null allele (202T) had frequencies of 0.12 and 0.88,
respectively, among 73 normal individuals.

Using an FCGR-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification
assay, Breunis et al. (2008) demonstrated extensive variation in the
FCGR2 and FCGR3 gene clusters, including copy number variation in
FCGR2C. They found that 82% of a white control population had only the
FCGR2C null allele, resulting in the presence of a pseudogene, while the
remaining 18% had at least 1 ORF allele and expressed a functionally
activating FCGR2C on their immune cells. The FCGR2C ORF allele was
significantly overrepresented in patients with immune idiopathic
thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP; 188030), with 34% of ITP patients having
at least 1 ORF allele.

Mueller et al. (2013) found that the increased risk of SLE associated
with reduced copy number of FCGR3B (610665) can be explained by the
presence of a chimeric gene, FCGR2B-prime, that occurs as a consequence
of FCGR3B deletion on FCGR3B zero-copy haplotypes. The FCGR2B-prime gene
consists of upstream elements and a 5-prime coding region that derive
from FCGR2C, and a 3-prime coding region that derives from FCGR2B
(604590). The coding sequence of FCGR2B-prime is identical to that of
FCGR2B, but FCGR2B-prime would be expected to be under the control of
5-prime flanking sequences derived from FCGR2C. Mueller et al. (2013)
found by flow cytometry, immunoblotting, and cDNA sequencing that
presence of the chimeric FCGR2B-prime gene results in the ectopic
presence of Fc-gamma-RIIb on NK cells, providing an explanation for SLE
risk associated with reduced FCGR3B copy number. To pursue the
underlying mechanism of SLE disease association with FCGR3B copy number
variation, Mueller et al. (2013) aligned the reference sequence (GRCh37)
of the proximal block of the FCGR locus (chr1:161,480,906-161,564,008)
to that of the distal block (chr1:161,562,570-161,645,839).
Identification of informative paralogous sequence variants (PSVs)
enabled Mueller et al. (2013) to narrow the potential breakpoint region
to a 24.5-kb region of paralogy between then 2 ancestral duplicated
blocks. The complete absence of nonpolymorphic PSVs in the 24.5-kb
region prevented more precise localization of the breakpoints in
FCGR3B-deleted or FCGR3B-duplicated haplotypes.

EVOLUTION

By determining the nature and rate of copy number variation (CNV)
mutation and investigating the global variation of disease-associated
variation at the FCGR locus, Machado et al. (2012) determined that CNV
of the FCGR3 genes is mediated by recurrent nonallelic homologous
recombination between the 2 segmental duplications that carry FCGR3A and
FCGR3B. They showed that pathogen richness, particularly helminth
pathogens, is likely to have influenced the patterns of variation in
FCGRs in humans. Machado et al. (2012) proposed that alterations to IgG
binding in the context of helminth infection have driven positive
selection in FCGR among different mammalian species, linking
evolutionary pressure of helminth infection with autoimmune disease via
adaptation at the genetic level. This model supports the 'hygiene
hypothesis,' which states that in the absence of chronic helminth
infection in modern populations, previously selected alleles respond to
immune system challenges differently and therefore may alter
susceptibility to autoimmune disease.

;;HETEROGENEOUS NUCLEAR RIBONUCLEOPROTEIN METHYLTRANSFERASE 1-LIKE 2;
HRMT1L2;;
HMT1-LIKE 2;;
INTERFERON RECEPTOR 1-BOUND PROTEIN 4; IR1B4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The PRMT1 gene encodes a protein arginine methyltransferase that
functions as a histone methyltransferase specific for H4 (see 602822).

CLONING

Protein arginine methylation is catalyzed by arginine
methyltransferases. The bulk of methylated arginine residues in
eukaryotic cells are found in heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins
(hnRNPs), RNA-binding proteins that play essential roles in the
metabolism of nuclear pre-mRNA. Lin et al. (1996) identified a rat cDNA
encoding PRMT1 (protein-arginine N-methyltransferase 1; EC 2.1.1.23).
Recombinant PRMT1 methylated histones and hnRNPA1 (164017) in vitro. By
using a yeast 2-hybrid screen to identify proteins that interact with
the intracytoplasmic domain of the interferon-alpha/beta receptor-1
(IFNAR1; 107450), Abramovich et al. (1997) identified a human cDNA
encoding a protein that was nearly identical to PRMT1. The deduced
361-amino acid protein was designated IR1B4 for 'interferon
receptor-1-bound protein 4.' Epitope-tagged IR1B4 bound the IFNAR1
intracytoplasmic domain in vitro. Antibodies against IFNAR1
coimmunoprecipitated a methyltransferase activity from human cell
extracts. An antisense oligonucleotide strongly reduced
methyltransferase activity in human cells, and caused them to become
more resistant to growth inhibition by interferon. Abramovich et al.
(1997) concluded that protein methylation, like phosphorylation, may be
an important signaling mechanism for certain cytokine receptors.

Scott et al. (1998) identified HRMT1L2 transcripts with variable 5-prime
ends that encode 3 protein variants with different N-terminal regions.
Rat PRMT1 and HRMT1L2 variant 2 (v2) share 95% sequence identity, but
diverge at their N termini. The amino acid sequences of HRMT1L2 and
HRMT1L1 (601961) are 27% identical. Recombinant protein methylated human
hnRNPA1 and a yeast hnRNP in vitro. The HRMT1L2 gene complemented
mutations in the yeast hnRNP methyltransferase gene HMT1. Northern blot
analysis revealed that HRMT1L2 is expressed as a predominant 1.4-kb mRNA
in various adult and fetal tissues. Additional larger and smaller bands
were observed in some tissues.

Scorilas et al. (2000) identified 3 splice variants of PRMT1, encoding
deduced polypeptides of 343 (variant 1), 361 (variant 2), and 347
(variant 3) amino acids with molecular masses of 39.6, 41.5, and 39.9
kD, respectively. The full-length protein (v3) contains an in-frame stop
codon in the middle of exon 3, and a second downstream start codon that
resumes transcription. Variant 2 is predicted to contain 3 hydrophobic
stretches, one of which may be a signal peptide. PRMT1 shares 96%, 34%
and 29% sequence identity with rat PRMT1, human PRMT3 (603190), and
human PRMT2 (HRMT1L1), respectively. RT-PCR revealed ubiquitous
expression of all 3 splice variants, with highest expression in
cerebellum, mammary gland, prostate, brain, and thyroid. The predominant
variant differed among tissues. By PCR analysis, Scorilas et al. (2000)
found that variants 1 and 2 were frequently downregulated in breast
cancers in comparison to normal breast tissue.

GENE FUNCTION

The S. cerevisiae ire15 mutation has an inositol auxotrophic phenotype
and a defect in the expression of the inositol 1-phosphate synthase
(INO1) gene. Nikawa et al. (1996) identified HRMT1L2, which they called
HCP1, as a gene that suppressed the ire15 mutation. Multicopy HRMT1L2
increased the level of INO1 mRNA in ire15 mutants. Both Abramovich et
al. (1997) and Scott et al. (1998) noted that the nucleotide sequence
reported by Nikawa et al. (1996) contained 3 deletions that resulted in
a frameshift between amino acids 147-175.

Wang et al. (2001) reported the purification, molecular identification,
and functional characterization of the histone H4-specific
methyltransferase PRMT1, a protein arginine methyltransferase. PRMT1
specifically methylates arginine-3 of histone H4 (see 602822) in vitro
and in vivo. Methylation of arg3 by PRMT1 facilitates subsequent
acetylation of H4 tails by p300 (602700). However, acetylation of H4
inhibits its methylation by PRMT1. Most important, a mutation in the
S-adenosyl-L-methionine-binding site of PRMT1 substantially crippled its
nuclear receptor coactivator activity. Wang et al. (2001) concluded that
their findings reveal arg3 of H4 as a novel methylation site by PRMT1
and indicate that arg3 methylation plays an important role in
transcriptional regulation.

Mowen et al. (2001) demonstrated that methylation of arg31 of STAT1
(600555) by PRMT1 is required for transcription induced by
IFN-alpha/IFN-beta. They concluded that arginine methylation of STAT1 is
an additional posttranslational modification regulating transcription
factor function, and alteration of arginine methylation might be
responsible for the lack of interferon responsiveness observed in many
malignancies.

Using systems reconstituted with recombinant chromatin templates and
coactivators, An et al. (2004) demonstrated the involvement of PRMT1 and
CARM1 (603934) in p53 (191170) function; both independent and ordered
cooperative functions of p300 (602700), PRMT1, and CARM1; and mechanisms
involving direct interactions with p53 and obligatory modifications of
corresponding histone substrates. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses
confirmed the ordered accumulation of these (and other) coactivators and
cognate histone modifications on a p53-responsive gene, GADD45 (126335),
following ectopic p53 expression and/or ultraviolet irradiation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Scorilas et al. (2000) determined that the PRMT1 gene (variant 3)
contains 12 exons and spans 11.2 kb, and that the 2 additional splice
variants contain 10 (variant 1) or 11 exons (variant 2). They found that
PRMT1 is located in close proximity to the IRF3 (603734) and RRAS
(165090) genes and is transcribed in the opposite direction. RRAS is the
most telomeric, followed by IRF3 and PRMT1.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell hybrid panels and by fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Scott et al. (1998) mapped the HRMT1L2 gene to 19q13.
Noting sequence identity between HRMT1L2 and a BAC clone, Scorilas et
al. (2000) refined the mapping to 19q13.3.

Pawlak et al. (2000) mapped the mouse Prmt1 gene to chromosome 7 by
interspecific backcross analysis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Pawlak et al. (2000) characterized a null mutation of the mouse Prmt1
gene, which is 95% identical to HRMT1L2. Prmt1 expression was greatest
along the midline of the neural plate and in the forming head fold from
embryonic day 7.5 (E7.5) to E8.5 and in the developing central nervous
system from E8.5 to E13.5. Homozygous mutant embryos failed to develop
beyond E6.5, with death occurring shortly after implantation and before
gastrulation. Prmt1, however, was not detected in embryonic stem cell
lines established from mutant blastocysts, suggesting it is not
necessary for cell viability. Prmt1 -/- cells expressed approximately 8
times less methyltransferase activity than wildtype cells, indicating
that the loss of Prmt1 activity is not compensated by an increase in
other methyltransferases. In addition, high performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) and methyl acceptor activity analysis determined
that the cell proteins of mutant cells were hypomethylated, whereas most
potential substrates were already methylated in wildtype cells.

601506	TITLE *601506 SEPTIN 2; SEPT2
;;NEURAL PRECURSOR CELL EXPRESSED, DEVELOPMENTALLY DOWNREGULATED 5;
NEDD5;;
DIFF6
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Mori et al. (1996) isolated a human cDNA that encodes a protein
homologous to murine H5 and Diff6 and to yeast CDC10 (603151). The NEDD5
cDNA encodes a predicted protein of 406 amino acids. The deduced peptide
sequence contains conserved domains rich in basic residues, a motif of
the GTPase superfamily. Different poly(A) sites account for generation
of 2 transcripts. The major 3.5-kb transcript was expressed ubiquitously
in all human tissues examined, and a 2.0-kb alternative transcript
lacking any long AU-rich element in the 3-prime noncoding region was
expressed abundantly only in testis, heart, and skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Low and Macara (2006) noted that specific combinations of septins can
hetero-oligomerize and form filaments in vitro and in vivo. Using
fluorescence resonance energy transfer, size exclusion chromatography,
and multi-angle light scattering analyses, they characterized the
complex formed by SEPT2, SEPT6 (300683), and SEPT7 (603151). SEPT6 and
SEPT7 interacted through a parallel coiled-coil domain, and SEPT2
interacted with SEPT6 through its C-terminal coiled-coil domain.

Kremer et al. (2007) showed that knockdown of SEPT2, SEPT6, and SEPT7 in
HeLa cells caused actin stress fibers to disintegrate and cells to lose
polarity. They found that these septins acted through SOCS7 (608788) to
restrict nuclear accumulation of NCK (NCK1; 600508). In the absence of
septin filaments, SOCS7 recruited NCK into the nucleus. Moreover,
depletion of NCK from the cytoplasm triggered dissolution of actin
stress fibers and loss of cell polarity. Kremer et al. (2007) also
showed that the association between septins, SOCS7, and NCK played a
role in the DNA damage checkpoint response. NCK entered the nucleus
following DNA damage and was required for ultraviolet (UV)-induced cell
cycle arrest. Furthermore, nuclear NCK was essential for activation of
p53 (TP53; 191170) in response to UV-induced DNA damage. Kremer et al.
(2007) concluded that septins, SOCS7, and NCK are part of a signaling
pathway that couples regulation of the DNA damage response to the
cytoskeleton.

Hu et al. (2010) demonstrated that ciliary membrane proteins are highly
mobile, but their diffusion is impeded at the base of the cilium by a
diffusion barrier. Sept2, a member of the septin family of guanosine
triphosphatases that form a diffusion barrier in budding yeast,
localized at the base of the ciliary membrane. Sept2 depletion resulted
in loss of ciliary membrane protein localization and Sonic hedgehog
(SHH; 600725) signal transduction, and inhibited ciliogenesis. Thus, Hu
et al. (2010) concluded that SEPT2 is a part of a diffusion barrier at
the base of the ciliary membrane and is essential for retaining
receptor-signaling pathways in the primary cilium. These experiments
used IMCD3 (mouse kidney inner medullary collecting duct) cells and
murine embryonic fibroblasts.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Sirajuddin et al. (2007) presented the crystal structures of the human
SEPT2 G domain and the heterotrimeric human SEPT2-SEPT6-SEPT7 complex.
This structure revealed a universal bipolar polymer building block,
composed of an extended G domain, which forms oligomers and filaments by
conserved interactions between adjacent nucleotide-binding sites and/or
the amino- and carboxy-terminal extensions. Unexpectedly, x-ray
crystallography and electron microscopy showed that the predicted coiled
coils are not involved in or required for complex and/or filament
formation. The asymmetrical heterotrimers associate head-to-head to form
a hexameric unit that is nonpolarized along the filament axis but is
rotationally asymmetrical. Sirajuddin et al. (2007) concluded that the
architecture of septin filaments differs fundamentally from that of
other cytoskeletal structures.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Mori et al. (1996) mapped the
NEDD5 gene to 2q37.

120240	TITLE *120240 COLLAGEN, TYPE VI, ALPHA-2; COL6A2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The COL6A2 gene encodes the alpha-2 subunit of type VI collagen, an
ubiquitously expressed extracellular matrix protein. It is 1 of the 3
subunits comprising the full collagen VI protein (see also COL6A1,
120220 and COL6A3, 120250) (summary by Zhang et al., 2010).

CLONING

Weil et al. (1988) isolated clones corresponding to the COL6A2 gene from
a human placenta expression library. Northern blot analysis detected a
3.5-kb mRNA transcript. The molecular mass of the protein is
approximately 140 kD.

Chu et al. (1989) determined that the COL6A2 protein contains 998 amino
acids with 31% identity to COL6A1 in the N-terminal and C-terminal
globular domains, which are connected by a triple helical segment. Both
COL6A1 and COL6A2 contain small signal peptide sequences. Internal
alignment of the globular sequences showed a repetitive 200-residue
structure (15 to 23% identity) occurring 3 times (N1, C1, C2) in each
chain. Sequencing of COL6A2 cDNA clones revealed 2 variant chains with a
distinct C2 subdomain and 3-prime noncoding region. The repetitive
segments C1, C2 and, to a lesser extent, N1 showed significant identity
(15 to 18%) to the collagen-binding A domains of von Willebrand factor
(VWF; 613160). These results suggested that the globular domains of the
COL6 proteins bind to collagenous structures.

Saitta et al. (1992) found that the human COL6A2 gene uses alternative
processing to produce multiple mRNA transcripts differing in the 5-prime
untranslated region as well as in the 3-prime coding and noncoding
sequences.

GENE STRUCTURE

Saitta et al. (1992) demonstrated that the COL6A2 gene contains 30 exons
and spans 36 kb.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid and FISH analysis, Weil et al. (1988) mapped the
COL6A2 gene to chromosome 21q22.3.

GENE FUNCTION

Klewer et al. (1998) studied COL6A2 gene expression in the developing
mammalian heart. The pattern of expression was identical to that of
COL6A1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 9 kindreds with the Bethlem form of autosomal dominant myopathy with
contractures (158810), Jobsis et al. (1996) demonstrated genetic linkage
to the COL6A1-COL6A2 cluster on 21q22.3. By sequence analysis in 4
families, Jobsis et al. (1996) identified a mutation in COL6A1 in 1
kindred and a mutation in COL6A2 in 2 others. Both mutations disrupted
the Gly-X-Y motif of the triple helical domain by substitution of gly
for either val or ser. Analogous to the putative perturbation of the
anchoring function of the dystrophin-associated complex in congenital
muscular dystrophy with mutations in the alpha-2-subunit of laminin
(156225), the observation suggested a similar mechanism in Bethlem
myopathy.

Ullrich scleroatonic muscular dystrophy, also known as Ullrich
congenital muscular dystrophy (UCMD; 254090), shares some clinical
features with Bethlem myopathy, such as joint contractures, but displays
a more severe course. Vanegas et al. (2001) demonstrated recessive
mutations in the COL6A2 gene (see 120240.0002) leading to UCMD.

Lampe et al. (2005) developed a method for rapid direct sequence
analysis of all 107 coding exons of the COL6 genes (COL6A1, COL6A2,
COL6A3; 120250) using single condition amplification/internal primer
(SCAIP) sequencing. They sequenced all 3 COL6 genes from genomic DNA in
79 patients with UCMD or Bethlem myopathy, and found putative mutations
in 1 of the COL6 genes in 62% of patients. Some patients showed changes
in more than one of the COL6 genes, and some UCMD patients appeared to
have dominant rather than recessive disease. Lampe et al. (2005)
concluded that these findings may explain some or all of the cases of
UCMD that are unlinked to the COL6 gene under a recessive model.

In 2 unrelated patients with Bethlem myopathy, Baker et al. (2007)
identified 2 different heterozygous mutations in the COL6A2 gene
(120240.0009; 120240.0010). In vitro studies indicated defective
collagen VI synthesis and secretion.

In 2 sibs with autosomal recessive myosclerosis (255600), Merlini et al.
(2008) identified a homozygous truncating mutation in the COL6A2 gene
(120240.0011).

Nadeau et al. (2009) identified a homozygous COL6A2 mutation (C777R;
120240.0012) in 3 patients with autosomal recessive UCMD. Two additional
patients had 2 different heterozygous COL6A2 mutations (see, e.g.,
G283R, 120240.0013), consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance.
Another patient was compound heterozygous for a mutation in the COL6A1
gene (G281R; 120220.0014) and a mutation in the COL6A2 gene (R498H;
120240.0014), consistent with digenic inheritance.

- Role of COL6A2 in Atrioventricular Septal Defect

Ackerman et al. (2012) used a candidate gene approach among individuals
with Down syndrome and complete atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD)
(141 cases) and Down syndrome with no congenital heart defect (141
controls) to determine whether rare genetic variants in genes involved
in atrioventricular valvuloseptal morphogenesis contribute to AVSD in
this sensitized population. Ackerman et al. (2012) found a significant
excess (p less than 0.0001) of variants predicted to be deleterious in
cases compared to controls. At the most stringent level of filtering,
they found potentially damaging variants in nearly 20% of cases but in
fewer than 3% of controls. The variants with the highest probability of
being damaging in cases only were found in 6 genes: COL6A1, COL6A2,
CRELD1 (607170) (already identified as a cause of AVSD; see 606217),
FBLN2 (135821), FRZB (605083), and GATA5 (611496). Several of the
case-specific variants were recurrent in unrelated individuals,
occurring in 10% of cases studied. No variants with an equal probability
of being damaging were found in controls, demonstrating a highly
specific association with AVSD. Of note, all of these genes are in the
VEGFA (192240) pathway, suggesting to Ackerman et al. (2012) that rare
variants in this pathway might contribute to the genetic underpinnings
of AVSD in humans.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Gualandi et al. (2009) reported 2 unrelated patients with Bethlem
myopathy who were each compound heterozygous for a truncating and a
missense mutation in the COL6A2 gene (Q819X, 120240.0011 and
R830Q/R843W, 120240.0017; R366X, 120240.0018 and D871N; 120240.0019,
respectively). Both patients remained ambulatory as adults, and muscle
biopsies and studies of fibroblasts showed variable degrees of aberrant
collagen VI microfilament formation. Gualandi et al. (2009) noted that
autosomal recessive inheritance had not been reported in Bethlem
myopathy and suggested that collagen VI-related myopathies comprise a
spectrum of conditions with variable severity. In addition, the findings
did not support pure haploinsufficiency as a causative mechanism for
Bethlem myopathy, and suggested that some previously reported patients
may harbor a second missed mutation. The genotype findings in these
patients had important implications for genetic counseling.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
BETHLEM MYOPATHY
COL6A2, GLY250SER

In 2 kindreds with Bethlem myopathy (158810), Jobsis et al. (1996)
demonstrated that affected members had a heterozygous missense mutation
(898G-A) resulting in a G250S amino acid substitution in the triple
helical region.

.0002
ULLRICH CONGENITAL MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
COL6A2, 1-BP INS, 1151C

In an Italian family, Vanegas et al. (2001) found that a son with
Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (254090) had a homozygous
insertion of a C leading to a premature termination codon in the triple
helical domain of COL6A2 mRNA. Both healthy consanguineous parents were
carriers. The insertion of the C was in a stretch of 5 cytosines between
nucleotides 1147 and 1151 of the COL6A2 cDNA, causing a slippage of the
reading frame with a premature termination codon at nucleotides
1347-1349. The affected patient in this family showed reduced fetal
movements. At birth he was unusually long (55 cm), showed multiple joint
contractures of his knees and elbows, a kyphotic contracture of the
spine, a left hip dislocation, bilateral congenital convex pes valgus,
long and slender fingers and toes with adducted thumbs, ogival palate,
micrognathia, and a short neck with torticollis. He also showed marked
bilateral distal hyperlaxity of fingers, toes, calcanei, and wrists. The
child walked at the age of 13 months, but generalized muscle weakness
persisted thereafter, and progressive scoliosis and respiratory failure
developed. He underwent tracheostomy and nocturnal positive pressure
mechanical ventilation at the age of 8 years, with signs of
diaphragmatic insufficiency. At the age of 11 years, he was still
ambulant and had normal intelligence.

In fibroblasts from the patient reported by Vanegas et al. (2001), Zhang
et al. (2002) showed almost complete absence of COL6A2 mRNA by Northern
blot analysis, suggesting that the mutation led to nonsense-mediated
mRNA decay. There was complete absence of secreted COL6A2 protein in the
medium of the patient's cells, suggesting that the mutation in the
triple helical domain prevented microfibrillar assembly and secretion.
Although both parents showed decreased levels of COL6A2 mRNA, long-term
collagen VI deposition was essentially normal.

.0003
ULLRICH CONGENITAL MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
COL6A2, IVS17, A-G, -2

In an Italian family, Vanegas et al. (2001) found that 2 brothers with
Ullrich scleroatonic muscular dystrophy (254090) had a splice acceptor
site mutation in the COL6A2 gene. Deletion of 28 nucleotides was caused
by an A-to-G substitution at nucleotide -2 of intron 17, causing
activation of a cryptic acceptor site within exon 18. The normal parents
were unrelated. Severe contractures of elbows and knees, rigidity of the
spine, ogival (gothic) palate, and hypotonia were present. In 1 brother
there was distal hyperlaxity and marked weakness of head flexors but
almost complete disappearance of limb joint contractures at the age of 2
years. In the brothers, this mutation was found in compound
heterozygosity with a splice site mutation in intron 23 (120240.0004).
The first mutation was present in the healthy mother, whereas the second
mutation was carried by the healthy father. In another Italian family,
Vanegas et al. (2001) found the same 28-bp deletion but did not find the
mutation in the other allele. This mutation occurred de novo in the
patient.

In fibroblasts from 1 of the patients reported by Vanegas et al. (2001)
who was a compound heterozygote for mutations in the COL6A2 gene, Zhang
et al. (2002) showed decreased levels of COL6A2 mRNA by Northern blot
analysis, suggesting that the mutations led to nonsense-mediated mRNA
decay. Low levels of COL6A2 protein were detected in the medium of the
patient's cells, suggesting that the mutations, which occurred at the
distal part of the triple helical domain, allowed secretion of a small
amount of mutant collagen VI protein. Further analysis showed that the
truncated proteins were able to form triple helical monomers, but unable
to assemble into dimers and tetramers for the completed collagen VI
protein. Zhang et al. (2002) noted that the IVS23 mutation (120240.0004)
retains the triple helical domain and thus can assemble into monomers,
but has a shorter C-terminal globular domain which prevents further
assembly into higher ordered structures. Although both parents showed
decreased levels of COL6A2 mRNA, long-term collagen VI deposition was
essentially normal.

.0004
ULLRICH CONGENITAL MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
COL6A2, IVS23, G-A, -1

Vanegas et al. (2001) described 2 brothers with Ullrich scleroatonic
muscular dystrophy (254090) who were compound heterozygotes for 2 splice
site mutations in the COL6A2 gene, one in intron 17 (120240.0003) and
the other a G-to-A substitution at nucleotide -1 in intron 23.

.0005
BETHLEM MYOPATHY
COL6A2, ASP620ASN

In a Caucasian family from Mississippi and North Carolina, Scacheri et
al. (2002) found 9 members with an autosomal dominant limb-girdle
muscular dystrophy phenotype. A causative missense mutation, asp620 to
asn (D620N), was present in heterozygous state. This mutation did not
overtly affect the expression of proteins of the extracellular matrix
(ECM), but did alter the expression of laminin beta-1 (150240) in the
basement membrane of muscle fibers. Type VI collagen was thought to
anchor the basal lamina to the extracellular matrix by interacting with
collagen type IV, which in turn was thought to bind laminin beta-1 (Kuo
et al., 1997). Scacheri et al. (2002) suggested that their studies widen
the clinical spectrum of Bethlem myopathy (158810) and indicated that
autosomal dominant limb-girdle muscular dystrophy should be studied for
possible collagen VI etiology.

.0006
ULLRICH CONGENITAL MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
COL6A2, 26-BP DEL, NT731

In a patient with Ullrich disease (254090), Higuchi et al. (2001)
identified a homozygous 26-bp deletion (nucleotides 731-756) in exon 14
of the COL6A2 gene, causing a frameshift and premature termination
codon, and resulting in a truncated collagen VI alpha-2 chain. Collagen
VI expression was absent from the patient's skeletal muscle and skin
samples.

.0007
ULLRICH CONGENITAL MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
COL6A2, IVS12AS, A-G, -10

In a patient with Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (254090),
Lucarini et al. (2005) identified a homozygous A-to-G transition in
intron 12 of the COL6A2 gene, resulting in deletion of exon 13, which
removed 21 amino acids from the N terminus of the triple helical domain.
The misaligned N-terminal region was predicted to interfere with the
assembly of collagen VI microfibrils. The intron mutation activated
numerous cryptic acceptor sites, generating both normal and exon
13-deleted COL6A2 mRNA as well as multiple transcripts containing
frameshifts that were degraded through nonsense-mediated decay.

.0008
ULLRICH CONGENITAL MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
COL6A2, 1.3-KB DEL

In a patient with Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (254090), Baker
et al. (2005) identified heterozygosity for a 1,332-bp deletion of the
COL6A2 gene, which included part of intron 5, all of exon 6 and intron
6, and part of exon 7 and was predicted to result in loss of 27 amino
acids in the triple helical region. The patient's mother was a mosaic
carrier of the deletion.

.0009
BETHLEM MYOPATHY
COL6A2, IVS10AS, A-G, -2

In a 40-year-old man with Bethlem myopathy (158810), Baker et al. (2007)
identified a heterozygous A-to-G transition in intron 10 of the COL6A2
gene, resulting in the skipping of exon 11. Exon 11 codes for the only
cysteine residue in the triple helical domain of the protein, which is
predicted to form a disulfide bond critical for dimerization. This would
result in decreased assembly of the collagen VI protein. Further
evidence indicated nonsense-mediated decay of an mRNA with a premature
stop codon, and reduced secretion of structurally abnormal collagen. The
patient had proximal muscle weakness, decreased motor capacity, joint
contractures, and dystrophic features on muscle biopsy.

BETHLEM MYOPATHY
COL6A2, PRO932LEU

In a 42-year-old Australian man with Bethlem myopathy (158810), Baker et
al. (2007) identified a heterozygous 2795C-T transition in exon 28 of
the COL6A2 gene, resulting in a pro932-to-leu (P932L) substitution in
the globular C2 A-domain. Three first cousins and a niece were affected
and also carried the mutation. The proband had proximal muscle weakness
and joint contractures. Further studies indicated that the mutant P932L
resulted in reduced intracellular collagen VI assembly and secretion.

BETHLEM MYOPATHY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
COL6A2, GLN819TER

In 2 sibs, born of consanguineous parents, with autosomal recessive
myosclerosis (255600), Merlini et al. (2008) identified a homozygous
2537C-T transition in exon 27 in the COL6A2 gene, resulting in a
gln819-to-ter (Q819X) substitution in the C1 domain. RT-PCR studies
showed that the mutation did not result in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay;
the translated truncated protein lacked the C2 domain. Studies in
patient fibroblasts showed decreased COL6A2 transcripts and decreased
amounts of collagen VI deposited in the extracellular matrix. The
secreted collagen VI microfibrils were abnormally organized and did not
assemble properly into tetramers. The heterozygous parents were
unaffected, suggesting that the mutation is not pathogenic in the
heterozygous state.

Gualandi et al. (2009) identified compound heterozygosity for the Q819X
mutation and a complex missense allele (R830Q/R843W; 120240.0017) in a
25-year-old woman with Bethlem myopathy (158800). Although this genotype
suggested autosomal recessive inheritance, the R819X mutation escaped
nonsense-mediated decay and was thought not to be pathogenic in the
heterozygous state, based on the report of Merlini et al. (2008).
However, the fact that the woman reported by Gualandi et al. (2009)
carried COL6A2 mutations on both alleles had implications for genetic
counseling.

ULLRICH CONGENITAL MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
COL6A2, CYS777ARG

In 3 patients with UCMD (254090), including 2 cousins, Nadeau et al.
(2009) identified a homozygous 2329T-C transition in exon 26 of the
COL6A2 gene, resulting in a cys777-to-arg (C777R) substitution. Onset
ranged from birth to 2 years. One child had congenital hip dislocation.
All had proximal muscle weakness and learned to walk independently at
about 1 year of age, but became wheelchair-bound at ages 6.8, 9, and
11.5 years, respectively. Other features included spinal rigidity,
scoliosis, and kyphosis. All also required nocturnal ventilation, and 1
needed gastrostomy for chewing difficulties. Only 1 had follicular
hyperkeratosis.

ULLRICH CONGENITAL MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
COL6A2, GLY283ARG

In a 20-year-old patient with UCMD (254090), Nadeau et al. (2009)
identified a heterozygous 847G-A transition in exon 6 of the COL6A2
gene, resulting in a gly283-to-arg (G283R) substitution. The patient had
onset at birth with hypotonia, contractures, scoliosis, and delayed
motor development. Walking with support was achieved at age 3.3 years,
but the patient became wheelchair-bound at age 10. Nocturnal ventilation
was also required. Skin changes included follicular hyperkeratosis and
keloid formation.

ULLRICH CONGENITAL MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, DIGENIC, COL6A1/COL6A2
COL6A2, ARG498HIS

In a 25-year-old patient with UCMD (254090), Nadeau et al. (2009)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in 2 different genes:
a 1493G-A transition in exon 18 of the COL6A2 gene, resulting in an
arg498-to-his (R498H) substitution, and a substitution in the COL6A1
gene (G281R; 120220.0014). The findings were consistent with digenic
inheritance. The patient had onset at age 1.5 years of delayed motor
development with proximal muscle weakness. Independent walking was
achieved, but the patient became wheelchair-bound at age 19. Spinal
rigidity, scoliosis, and contractures were also present, as well as
follicular hyperkeratosis and a requirement for nocturnal ventilation.

.0015
ULLRICH CONGENITAL MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
COL6A2, GLU624LYS

In a Brazilian girl with Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (254090),
Zhang et al. (2010) identified a homozygous 1870G-A transition in the
COL6A2 gene, resulting in a glu624-to-lys (E624K) substitution in the C1
globular subdomain. Sequence alignment and molecular modeling indicated
that the mutation occurred in a consensus metal ion-dependent adhesion
site (MIDAS). Patient fibroblasts deposited abundant collagen VI
microfibrils that were thick and abnormally knotty. HEK293 cells
transfected with the mutation assembled low levels of short collagen VI
microfibrils. The E624K mutation did not affect collagen VI formation
and assembly and did not exert a dominant-negative effect, as
heterozygous family members were unaffected. However, the E624K-mutant
chain was less efficient in supporting microfibrillar assembly than
wildtype.

.0016
ULLRICH CONGENITAL MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
COL6A2, ARG876SER

In a young man, born of consanguineous Filipino parents, with Ullrich
congenital muscular dystrophy (254090), Zhang et al. (2010) identified a
homozygous 2626C-A transversion in the COL6A2 gene, resulting in an
arg876-to-ser (R876S) substitution in the beta-2 strand of the C2
globular subdomain. Patient fibroblasts produced almost no collagen VI
microfibrils in the extracellular matrix. The minute amounts of COL6A2
that were produced consisted of the C2a splice variant with a shorter
alternative C2 subdomain not affected by the missense mutation. The C2a
splice variant COL6A2 was not assembled into a triple-helical collagen
VI molecule. HEK293 cells transfected with the R876S mutation showed
intracellular retention of the mutant chain and were unable to
synthesize normal collagen VI microfibrils. However, the patient showed
a slightly less severe phenotype than another affected patient with a
different mutation (see 120240.0015), suggesting that the low levels of
COL6A2 with alternatively spliced C2a may have functionally compensated
for loss of normal COL6A2.

BETHLEM MYOPATHY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
COL6A2, ARG830GLN AND ARG843TRP

In a 25-year-old woman with Bethlem myopathy (158810), Gualandi et al.
(2009) identified compound heterozygosity for variations in the COL6A2
gene. The maternal allele carried a 2571G-A and a 2609C-T transition,
both in exon 28, resulting in an arg830-t-gln (R830Q) and an
arg843-to-trp (R843W) substitution, respectively, in the C2 domain. Both
mutations affected highly conserved residues. The paternal allele
carried a Q819X (120240.0011) substitution. The patient had onset of
progressive proximal muscle weakness at age 2 years. During the course
of the disorder, she developed prominent joint contractures and
decreased forced vital capacity (65% of predicted), but retained
independent ambulation. Muscle biopsy showed a myopathic pattern and
fibrosis with mildly decreased collagen VI staining. Studies of
fibroblasts showed absence of collagen VI tetramer formation, but
electron microscopy showed correct filamentous and interconnected
collagen VI microfilaments. Gualandi et al. (2009) concluded that this
woman showed rare autosomal recessive inheritance of Bethlem myopathy
based on her genotype. However, the authors noted that the R819X
mutation escaped nonsense-mediated decay and was thought not to be
pathogenic in the heterozygous state, based on the report of Merlini et
al. (2008). The fact that the woman reported by Gualandi et al. (2009)
carried COL6A2 mutations on both alleles had implications for genetic
counseling.

BETHLEM MYOPATHY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
COL6A2, ARG366TER

In a 47-year-old man with Bethlem myopathy (158810), Gualandi et al.
(2009) identified compound heterozygous mutations in the COL6A2 gene: a
1178C-T transition in exon 12, resulting in an arg366-to-ter (R366X)
substitution, and a de novo 2693G-A transition in exon 28, resulting in
an asp871-to-asn (D871N; 120240.0019) substitution in a conserved region
of the C2 domain. The nonsense mutation was demonstrated to undergo
nonsense-mediated decay. The patient's unaffected mother carried the
heterozygous R377X mutation, suggesting that it is not pathogenic in the
heterozygous state. The patient was born with talipes equinovarus and
had Achilles contractures in childhood. He had limb-girdle weakness with
joint contractures and reduced vital capacity (64% of predicted). At age
47, he could walk with aid, but could no longer rise from the floor.
Muscle biopsy showed dystrophic features and decreased collagen VI.
Studies of fibroblasts showed severely decreased levels of all forms of
collagen VI, and electron microscopy showed irregular collagen VI
microfilaments with absence of normal network structure. Gualandi et al.
(2009) concluded that this patient had autosomal recessive Bethlem
myopathy because of the genotype and his ability to remain ambulatory.
The authors stated that the combination of a missense and a nonsense
mutation in the COL6A2 gene had not previously been reported, yielding
implications for genetic counseling.

ULLRICH CONGENITAL MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
COL6A2, 6-BP DEL, 1855

In a girl with UCMD (254090), Tooley et al. (2010) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the COL6A2 gene: a 6-bp deletion in
exon 25 (1855_1860del6) causing an in-frame deletion of 2 amino acids in
the N-terminal C1 VWA domain (V619_I620del2), and a G-to-T transversion
in intron 23 (1771-1G-T; 120240.0021), resulting in the skipping of exon
24, a frameshift, and premature termination. Each mutation was inherited
from an unaffected parent. Northern blot analysis of patient fibroblasts
showed that the intron 23 mutation resulted in nonsense-mediated mRNA
decay. Patient fibroblasts showed reduced, but present, collagen VI
production, indicating that the COL6A1 and COL6A3 chains could associate
with mutant COL6A2, forming monomers, dimers, and tetramers. However,
kinetic studies showed that the mutation delayed the assembly and
secretion of collagen VI compared to controls, and several additional
approaches showed that the mutation prevented the association of
secreted tetramers into collagen VI microfibrils. Recombinant C1 domains
containing the mutation were insoluble and retained intracellularly as
disulfide-bonded aggregates, consistent with misfolding. The findings
indicated that a correctly folded COL6A2 C1 domain is important for
microfibril assembly.
