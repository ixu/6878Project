DESCRIPTION 
GENE FUNCTION

Ando et al. (1996) noted that HKE6 possesses remarkable amino acid
sequence conservation with several bacterial proteins having
oxidoreductase activity. HKE6 also shows significant homology with the 2
unique functional domains containing the nucleotide cofactor-binding
site and the consensus motif characteristic of the members of the
superfamily of short-chain alcohol dehydrogenases such as human and rat
steroid and prostaglandin dehydrogenases.

The abnormal regulation of the Ke6 gene, which is located within the
major histocompatibility complex, has been linked to the development of
recessive polycystic kidney disease (see 263200) in the mouse.
Fomitcheva et al. (1998) showed that mouse Ke6 is a
17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (see HSD17B4; 601860) and can
regulate the concentration of biologically active estrogens and
androgens. The Ke6 enzyme is preferentially an oxidative enzyme and
inactivates estradiol, testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone. However,
the enzyme has some reductive activity and can synthesize estradiol from
estrone. The authors found that Ke6 is expressed within the ovaries and
testes, although at slightly less levels than in kidney. The presence of
Ke6 protein within the cumulus cells surrounding the oocyte places it in
a strategic location to control the level of steroids to which the egg
is exposed. Previously, it had been shown that glucocorticoids can
induce renal cysts in the neonatal rodent only when given at a narrow
time window of postnatal kidney development. Fomitcheva et al. (1998)
proposed that the reduction in the level of Ke6 enzyme, which occurs in
cpk, jck, and pcy mice, may lead to abnormal elevations in the local
level of sex steroids, which either directly or indirectly via abnormal
glucocorticoid metabolism result in recessive renal cystic disease, a
developmental disorder of the kidney.

The morphology and histology of the female reproductive organs in the
cpk/cpk mouse are strikingly immature and underdeveloped. Aziz et al.
(2001) reported the detection of the Ke6 protein in normal male
reproductive tissues by immunofluorescent staining. They determined in
the cpk mouse that the testes, similar to the immature ovaries, are
underdeveloped and arrested at an early developmental stage. Direct
measurement of 17-beta-HSD activity showed a conspicuous reduction in
sex steroid metabolism in the cpk/cpk testes. The authors concluded that
estrogen/androgen metabolism play an important role in the development
of the urogenital system.

MAPPING

Ando et al. (1996) mapped the HKE6 gene to the centromeric end of
6q21.3. Kikuti et al. (1997) examined YAC clone Y42, which contains the
MHC class II region of chromosome 6q21.3. This region has a relatively
high gene density. They identified the following human genes (in order
from centromere toward telomere): HSET
(603763)--HKE1.5--HKE2--HKE3--RING1 (602045)-- HKE6--HKE4 (601416)--RXRB
(180246)--COL11A2 (120290)--DPB2.

600599	TITLE *600599 KRUPPEL-LIKE FACTOR 1; KLF1
;;ERYTHROID KRUPPEL-LIKE FACTOR; EKLF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The KLF1 gene encodes an essential transcriptional activator that
directs high-level expression of the adult beta-globin promoter by
binding to its CACCC element (Bieker, 1996). KLF1 also acts as a
transcription factor for the BCAM protein (612773) as well as for other
proteins expressed on erythroid cells (summary by Helias et al., 2013).

CLONING

Bieker (1996) isolated KLF1, which is the human homolog of murine Eklf.
The predicted KLF1 protein contains 3 zinc fingers that share more than
90% sequence similarity with, and are predicted to bind the same target
sequence as, mouse Eklf. The rest of the protein is proline-rich and
retains approximately 70% sequence similarity to the mouse gene. Human
KLF1 is expressed in bone marrow and erythroleukemic cells lines but not
in myeloid or lymphoid cell lines.

Van Ree et al. (1997) cloned KLF1 from a bone marrow cDNA library. The
predicted 362-amino acid human protein is 69% identical to that of mouse
Eklf. Northern blot analysis revealed expression exclusively in
erythropoietic tissues (fetal liver and adult bone marrow).

GENE STRUCTURE

Bieker (1996) determined that the KLF1 gene is contained within 3 kb of
genomic DNA, and its coding region is interrupted by 2 introns whose
locations are conserved with the murine gene.

MAPPING

Van Ree et al. (1997) mapped the KLF1 gene to chromosome 19p13.13-p13.12
by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

GENE FUNCTION

Nuez et al. (1995) and Perkins et al. (1995) used homologous
recombination in embryonic stem cells to inactivate the mouse Eklf gene
and demonstrated defective hematopoiesis. The Eklf gene was originally
isolated from mouse erythroid cell RNA by differential screening and was
shown to be erythroid-specific, although a lower level of Eklf was found
in mast cell lines. Eklf contains 3 zinc fingers homologous to those
found in the Kruppel family of transcription factors (see 165220).
Because it binds to the sequence CCACACCCT, EKLF was suspected to affect
erythroid development through its ability to bind to the CAC box in the
promoter of the beta-globin gene (HBB; 141900). The mutation in this
element leads to reduced beta-globin expression, and it appears to
mediate the effect of the globin locus control region on the promoter.
From study of transgenic mice heterozygous for a lacZ reporter sequence
within the EKLF gene, Nuez et al. (1995) found that the reporter gene is
expressed in a developmentally specific manner in all types of
erythroblasts in the fetal liver and adult bone marrow. Homozygous
EKLF-deficient mice appeared normal during the embryonic stage of
hematopoiesis in the yolk sac, but developed a fatal anemia during early
fetal life when hematopoiesis shifted to the fetal liver. Enucleated
erythrocytes were formed, but these did not contain the proper amount of
hemoglobin. Perkins et al. (1995) pointed out that the anemia developing
during fetal liver erythropoiesis has the molecular and hematologic
features of beta-globin deficiency found in beta-thalassemia. Although
it is expressed at all stages, EKLF is not required for yolk sac
erythropoiesis, erythroid commitment, or expression of other potential
target genes. Its stage-specific and beta-globin gene-specific
requirement suggests that EKLF may facilitate completion of the
fetal-to-adult (hemoglobin gamma to beta) switch in humans.

EKLF is necessary for stage-specific expression of the human beta-globin
gene. Armstrong et al. (1998) showed that EKLF requires a
SWI/SNF-related chromatin remodeling complex, EKLF coactivator
remodeling complex-1 (ERC1), to generate a DNase I hypersensitive,
transcriptionally active beta-globin promoter on chromatin templates in
vitro. ERC1 contains BRG1, BAF170 (601734), BAF155 (601732), and INI1
(601607) homologs of yeast SWI/SNF subunits, as well as a subunit unique
to higher eukaryotes, BAF57 (603111), which is critical for chromatin
remodeling and transcription with EKLF. Thus, a member of the SWI/SNF
family acts directly in transcriptional activation and may regulate
subsets of genes by selectively interacting with specific DNA-binding
proteins.

Singleton et al. (2008) found that loss-of-function mutations in the
KLF1 gene result in the dominantly inherited Lutheran-negative In(Lu)
red blood cell phenotype (INLU; 111150). In(Lu) was originally
postulated to result from inheritance of a gene that inhibited or
suppressed the Lutheran antigen gene (BCAM; 612773) (Gibson, 1976). The
findings of Singleton et al. (2008) indicated that the lack of
expression of the Lu antigen in this phenotype results from decreased
transcription of erythroid-specific genes associated with red blood cell
maturation.

Schoenfelder et al. (2010) found that mouse Hbb and Hba (141800)
associate with hundreds of active genes from nearly all chromosomes in
nuclear foci that they called 'transcription factories.' The 2 globin
genes preferentially associated with a specific and partially
overlapping subset of active genes. Schoenfelder et al. (2010) also
noted that expression of the Hbb locus is strongly dependent upon Klf1,
while expression of the Hba locus is only partially dependent on Klf1.
Immunofluorescence analysis of mouse erythroid cells showed that most
Klf1 localized to the cytoplasm and that nuclear Klf1 was present in
discrete sites that overlapped with RNAII foci. Klf1 knockout in mouse
erythroid cells specifically disrupted the association of Klf1-regulated
genes within the Hbb-associated network. Klf1 knockout more weakly
disrupted interactions within the specific Hba network. Schoenfelder et
al. (2010) showed that KLF1-regulated genes share KLF1-containing
transcription factories and that KLF1 is required for the clustering of
these coregulated genes. They concluded that transcriptional regulation
involves a complex 3-dimensional network rather than factors acting on
single genes in isolation.

Borg et al. (2010) demonstrated that KLF1 binds to and activates the
promoter region of the BCL11A gene (606557), which is a repressor of the
fetal hemoglobin genes HBG1 (142200) and HBG2 (142250). Chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay of human erythroid progenitors from
adult peripheral blood showed strong binding of KLF1 to the BCL11A
promoter, whereas such binding was not observed in human fetal liver
erythroid progenitors. These findings indicated that KLF1 acts as a dual
regulator of fetal-to-adult globin switching in humans by acting as a
preferential activator of the HBB gene and by activating expression of
BCL11A, which in turn represses the HBG1x and HBG2 genes.

Arnaud et al. (2010) found that KLF1 plays a role in the expression of
the water channel AQP1 (107776) and the adhesion molecule CD44 (107269)
on erythroid cells.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Lutheran Red Blood Cell Group

Singleton et al. (2008) identified 9 different heterozygous
loss-of-function mutations in the KLF1 gene (see, e.g.,
600599.0001-600599.0004) in 21 of 24 persons with the dominant In(Lu)
phenotype (INLU; 111150). The individuals had no reported pathology,
indicating that 1 functional KLF1 allele is sufficient to sustain human
erythropoiesis. KLF1 mutations were not identified in 37 controls.

In red blood cell samples from 10 probands with the dominant In(Lu)
phenotype, Helias et al. (2013) identified 10 different heterozygous
loss-of-function mutations in the KLF1 gene (see, e.g.,
600599.0007-600599.0009). Flow cytometric analysis indicated that the
red blood cells from these individuals had some weak expression of the
Lu(b) antigen and low expression of CD44 (107269). In addition, these
individuals had increased levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) (mean of
2.14%) compared to controls (mean less than 1.0%), and slightly
increased levels of HbA2 (141850). Finally, 9 In(Lu) individuals who
were heterozygous for the P1 allele (607922.0007) did not express the P1
antigen (see 111400), whereas 1 who was homozygous for the P1 allele
expressed only weak P1. These findings suggested that the expression of
P1 is suppressed in the In(Lu) blood type. Helias et al. (2013)
concluded that the KLF1 haploinsufficiency has different effects on the
expression of different erythroid proteins, likely reflecting the
variable dependence of their respective genes on the KLF1 transcription
factor.

- Hereditary Persistence of Fetal Hemoglobin, KLF1-Related

In affected members of a Maltese family with hereditary persistence of
fetal hemoglobin (613566), Borg et al. (2010) identified a heterozygous
mutation in the KLF1 gene (K288X; 600599.0005). In vitro functional
expression assays showed that loss of KLF1 function resulted in
decreased BCL11A expression and increased expression of the fetal
hemoglobin genes HBG1 and HBG2.

- Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anemia IV

In 2 unrelated patients with congenital dyserythropoietic anemia IV
(CDAN4; 613673), one of whom was reported by Wickramasinghe et al.
(1991), Arnaud et al. (2010) identified a heterozygous de novo mutation
in the KLF1 gene (E325K; 600599.0006). The findings indicated that the
KLF1 gene plays a critical role in the regulation of several genes
during erythropoiesis, and that dysregulation of certain gene targets
can result in dyserythropoiesis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Wijgerde et al. (1996) produced a strain of Eklf-knockout mice, embryos
of which expressed the epsilon- and gamma-globin genes normally. Gamma-
and beta-globins were expressed with altered ratios in heterozygous
knockout mouse fetal liver. Homozygous knockout mouse fetuses had no
beta-globin transcription and had coincident changes in chromatin
structure at the beta promoter. Wijgerde et al. (1996) proposed that
EKLF stabilizes the interaction between the globin locus control region
and the beta-globin gene. In addition, they considered these findings to
provide further evidence that developmental modulation of globin gene
expression within individual cells is accomplished by alteration of the
frequency and/or duration of transcriptional periods of a gene, rather
than by a change in the rate of transcription.

Zhou et al. (2010) found that transgenic mice homozygous for a deletion
of the 50-bp HS1 enhancer (EHS1) in the Klf1 gene had greatly increased
gene expression ratios of mouse epsilon-y2-globin/beta-globin and
BAC-derived human gamma-globin/beta-globin in the liver at embryonic day
14.5. Adult erythroid progenitors isolated from the mutant mice showed
markedly reduced Bcl11a expression, suggesting that Klf1 regulates
Bcl11a expression. ChIP analysis showed that wildtype Klf1 binds to a
CACCC box in the promoter region of Bcl11a. Studies in adult human
progenitor blood cells showed that knockdown of KLF1 resulted in
decreased BCL11A expression and upregulation of gamma-globin genes,
similar to the mouse studies. The findings indicated that developmental
stage-specific changes in KLF1 abundance mediate the competitive
interactions of globin gene expression.

Lyon (1983, 1986) described an ethylnitrosourea-induced mouse mutation,
neonatal anemia (Nan), resulting in a semidominant hemolytic anemia that
shares several features of hereditary spherocytosis (see 182900). Nan
was mapped to mouse chromosome 8. Siatecka et al. (2010) identified the
Nan mutation as a glu339-to-asp (E339D) substitution in the second C2H2
zinc finger motif of Eklf. E339 is absolutely conserved across the
entire mouse and human KLF family and across EKLF proteins from
different species. The substitution, which is conservative, did not
affect Eklf protein expression, but it abrogated binding of mutant Eklf
to a subset of Eklf target promoters containing a thymidine in the
middle position of the Eklf-binding motif. This altered binding
specificity of mutant Eklf resulted in distorted Eklf-dependent gene
expression and abnormal residual embryonic beta-h1 globin expression in
Nan heterozygous mice. The Nan mutation was more severe than Eklf
deletion, as homozygous Nan mutant mice died at an earlier embryonic
time point than Eklf -/- embryos. Furthermore, heterozygous Nan mice
showed severe anemia, whereas Eklf +/- mice were indistinguishable from
wildtype.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
BLOOD GROUP--LUTHERAN INHIBITOR
KLF1, 1-BP DUP, 954G

In 8 individuals of English descent with the dominant In(Lu) blood
phenotype (INLU; 111150), Singleton et al. (2008) identified a
heterozygous 1-bp duplication (954dupG) in exon 3 of the KLF1 gene,
resulting in a frameshift and premature termination. The substitution
was predicted to render the transcription factor nonfunctional. The
individuals had no reported pathology, indicating that 1 functional KLF1
allele is sufficient to sustain human erythropoiesis.

.0002
BLOOD GROUP--LUTHERAN INHIBITOR
KLF1, 1-BP DEL, 569C

In 6 individuals of Spanish descent with the dominant In(Lu) blood
phenotype (INLU; 111150), Singleton et al. (2008) identified a
heterozygous 1-bp deletion (569delC) in exon 2 of the KLF1 gene,
resulting in a frameshift and premature termination. The substitution
was predicted to render the transcription factor nonfunctional. The
individuals had no reported pathology, indicating that 1 functional KLF1
allele is sufficient to sustain human erythropoiesis.

.0003
BLOOD GROUP--LUTHERAN INHIBITOR
KLF1, LYS292TER

In an individual with the dominant In(Lu) blood phenotype (INLU;
111150), Singleton et al. (2008) identified a heterozygous 874A-T
transversion in the KLF1 gene, resulting in a lys292-to-ter (K292X)
substitution. The substitution was predicted to result in premature
termination and a lack of all zinc finger domains.

.0004
BLOOD GROUP--LUTHERAN INHIBITOR
KLF1, HIS299TYR

In an individual with the dominant In(Lu) blood phenotype (INLU;
111150), Singleton et al. (2008) identified a heterozygous 895C-T
transition in the KLF1 gene, resulting in a his299-to-tyr (H299Y)
substitution. The substitution was predicted to result in diminished
zinc binding.

.0005
HEREDITARY PERSISTENCE OF FETAL HEMOGLOBIN, KLF1-RELATED
KLF1, LYS288TER

In affected members of a Maltese family with hereditary persistence of
fetal hemoglobin (613566), Borg et al. (2010) identified a heterozygous
A-to-T transversion in the KLF1 gene, resulting in a lys288-to-ter
(K288X) substitution, which was not found in 400 controls. The mutation
was predicted to ablate the complete zinc finger domain and abrogate DNA
binding. The truncated protein was not detected in patient cells,
suggesting nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The proband was ascertained
because of mild hypochromatic microcytic indices, but no other
phenotypic abnormalities were described. Gene expression profiles showed
that mutation carriers had decreased expression of the fetal globin
repressor BCL11A (606557), and upregulation of the fetal hemoglobin
genes HBG1 (142200) and HBG2 (142250). Knockdown of KLF1 in control
cells caused similar changes in gene expression, and further expression
studies excluded a dominant-negative effect of the K288X mutant protein.
Borg et al. (2010) concluded that haploinsufficiency for KLF1 is a cause
of HPFH.

.0006
ANEMIA, DYSERYTHROPOIETIC CONGENITAL, TYPE IV
KLF1, GLU325LYS

In 2 unrelated patients with congenital dyserythropoietic anemia IV
(CDAN4; 613673), Arnaud et al. (2010) identified a heterozygous de novo
973G-A transition in exon 3 of the KLF1 gene, resulting in a
glu325-to-lys (E325K) substitution. One of the patients had previously
been reported by Wickramasinghe et al. (1991). The phenotype was
characterized by hydrops and severe anemia at birth, ineffective
erythropoiesis, nucleated peripheral red blood cells, and absence of
expression of CD44 (107269) and AQP1 (107776) on erythrocytes. Both
patients also showed increased fetal hemoglobin. The E325K mutation
occurred in a conserved residue in the second zinc finger domain, and
structural modeling predicted that the mutation would stabilize the bond
between KLF1 and DNA target sequences. Expression studies in human
erythroid cells showed that the mutant E325K protein had similar
expression and nuclear localization as the wildtype protein. However,
the mutant protein showed markedly decreased transcriptional activity
toward CD44 and AQP1 compared to wildtype, consistent with the clinical
findings. The mutant KLF1 protein also showed a dominant-negative
effect. The findings indicated that the KLF1 gene plays a critical role
in the regulation of several genes during erythropoiesis, and that
dysregulation of certain gene targets can result in dyserythropoiesis.

By in vitro functional expression studies, Helias et al. (2013)
demonstrated that the E325K mutant KLF1 protein retained transactivation
activity for the BCAM (612773) promoter as well as, or ever better than,
wildtype KLF1. The findings were consistent with the fact that CDAN4 is
not associated with reduced levels of BCAM on red blood cells.

.0007
BLOOD GROUP--LUTHERAN INHIBITOR
KLF1, LEU326ARG

In a blood sample derived from a patient with the dominant In(Lu) blood
phenotype (111150), Helias et al. (2013) identified a heterozygous
977T-G transversion in the KLF1 gene, resulting in a leu326-to-arg
(L326R) substitution in the zinc finger domain. In vitro functional
expression studies indicated that the mutant protein resulted in reduced
transcriptional activity of BCAM (612773) compared to wildtype KLF1,
consistent with a loss of function.

.0008
BLOOD GROUP--LUTHERAN INHIBITOR
KLF1, HIS357GLN

In a blood sample derived from a patient with the dominant In(Lu) blood
phenotype (111150), Helias et al. (2013) identified a heterozygous
1071C-A transversion in the KLF1 gene, resulting in a his357-to-gln
(H357Q) substitution in the zinc finger domain. In vitro functional
expression studies indicated that the mutant protein resulted in reduced
transcriptional activity of BCAM (612773) compared to wildtype KLF1,
consistent with a loss of function.

.0009
BLOOD GROUP--LUTHERAN INHIBITOR
KLF1, TYR197TER

In a mother and son with the dominant In(Lu) blood phenotype (111150),
Helias et al. (2013) identified a heterozygous 591C-G transversion in
the KLF1 gene, resulting in a tyr197-to-ter (Y197X) substitution. Flow
cytometric analysis of patient blood cells showed weak expression of the
Lu(b) antigen and low expression of CD44 (107269). Both individuals also
had increased levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) (3.5% and 3.7%,
respectively) compared to non-KLF1 mutation family members (0.9-1.1%
HbF).

134350	TITLE *134350 COMPLEMENT FACTOR D; CFD
;;FACTOR D; DF;;
ADIPSIN; ADN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The CFD gene encodes complement factor D, a serine protease that acts in
the alternative complement pathway to complete the formation of the C3
convertase enzyme by cleaving factor B (CFB; 138470) bound to C3b
(120700), yielding C3bBb. Factor D is the initial obligatory and
rate-limiting catalytic component in the alternative complement pathway
(summary by White et al., 1992 and Biesma et al., 2001).

CLONING

White et al. (1992) isolated clones corresponding to the human CFD gene
from a human glioma cDNA library. The deduced mature protein contains
228 amino acids and was determined to be the same as the adipsin protein
identified in mice (Rosen et al., 1989). Northern blot analysis detected
a 1.1-kb mRNA transcript in adipocytes, monocytes, and macrophages. The
recombinant protein showed enzymatic activity of complement factor D,
cleaving factor B only when B was complexed with activated component
C3b. The findings suggested that adipose tissue may have a role in
immune system biology.

GENE FUNCTION

White et al. (1992) found that adipose cells are the main source of
factor D. There is a gradient in the concentration of factor D in the
fat cells of the body; more is present in the upper than in the lower
half of the body (Mathieson and Peters, 1997). In a review of the
complement system, Walport (2001) noted that the C3 nephritic
autoantibody can be associated with acquired partial lipodystrophy
(613913). The C3 nephritic autoantibody stabilizes the C3bBb C3
convertase that forms in the immediate vicinity of adipocytes. The
abnormally stabilized enzyme may then cleave enough C3 to allow assembly
of the membrane-attack complex, which lyses adipocytes. The pattern of
fat loss, which involves the upper half of the body, may reflect the
content of factor D.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Forneris et al. (2010) presented crystal structures of the proconvertase
C3bB at 4-angstrom resolution and its complex with factor D at
3.5-angstrom resolution. Their data showed how factor B (138470) binding
to C3b forms an open 'activation' state of C3bB. Factor D specifically
binds the open conformation of factor B through a site distant from the
catalytic center and is activated by the substrate, which displaces
factor D's self-inhibitory loop. This concerted proteolytic mechanism,
which if cofactor-dependent and substrate-induced, restricts complement
amplification to C3b-tagged target cells.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Factor D is unusual among serum proteins in having a single-banded
pattern in isoelectric focusing. Hobart and Lachmann (1976) found a
variant in 3 persons of West African parentage (2 Nigerians and a West
Indian) among 120 tested. No variants were found among 115 British and
26 Asian Indians. The presence of the variant band was associated with
weakening of the normal band. Both bands were of equal strength (Martin
et al., 1976).

- Complement Factor D Deficiency

In a Dutch family with factor D deficiency (CFDD; 613912), Biesma et al.
(2001) identified a homozygous mutation in the CFD gene (134350.0001).
The proband was a 23-year-old woman who presented with septic shock due
to Neisseria meningitidis in blood and cerebrospinal fluid. A deceased
family member had a history of recurrent bacterial meningitis.
Laboratory studies showed absence of factor D activity in the proband.
However, 3 other family members who did not have a history of recurrent
infections also showed absence of factor D activity.

Sprong et al. (2006) described the clinical course of meningococcal
disease in 2 children of a Turkish family with a novel factor D gene
mutation (134350.0002) leading to undetectable factor D plasma
concentrations.

ANIMAL MODEL

Adipsin is a serine protease that is secreted by adipocytes into the
bloodstream. It is deficient in several animal models of obesity. Rosen
et al. (1989) purified recombinant mouse adipsin and studied its
biochemical and enzymatic properties. Activated adipsin had little or no
proteolytic activity toward most substrates but had the same activity as
human complement factor D.

To assess the contribution of the alternative pathway in complement
activation and host defense and its possible role in the regulation of
systemic energy balance in vivo, Xu et al. (2001) generated factor
D-deficient mice by gene targeting. Mutant mice had no apparent
abnormality in development and their body weights were similar to those
of factor D-sufficient littermates. Complement activation could not be
initiated in the serum of deficient mice by alternative pathway
activators, namely, rabbit erythrocytes and zymosan. Injection of cobra
venom factor caused a profound and reproducible reduction in serum C3
levels, whereas, as expected, there was no C3 reduction in factor
B-deficient mice treated similarly. Studies of C3 and factor B
activation in vitro by cobra venom factor demonstrated that in factor
D-deficient serum the alpha chain of C3 was cleaved gradually over a
period of 60 minutes without detectable cleavage of factor B. Kinetics
of opsonization of Streptococcus pneumoniae by C3 fragments was much
slower in factor D-deficient serum, suggesting a significant
contribution of the alternative pathway to antibacterial host defense
early after infection.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
COMPLEMENT FACTOR D DEFICIENCY
CFD, SER42TER

In 5 affected members of a consanguineous Dutch family with complement
factor D deficiency (613912), Biesma et al. (2001) identified a
homozygous C-to-A transversion in the CFD gene, resulting in a
ser42-to-ter (S42X) substitution. The proband was a 23-year-old woman
who presented with septic shock due to Neisseria meningitidis in blood
and CSF. A deceased family member had a history of recurrent bacterial
meningitis. Laboratory studies showed absence of factor D activity in
the proband. However, 3 other family members who did not have a history
of recurrent infections also showed absence of factor D activity.

.0002
COMPLEMENT FACTOR D DEFICIENCY
CFD, VAL213GLY AND CYS214ARG

In a sister and brother, born of consanguineous parents, with invasive
meningococcal disease due to complement factor D deficiency (613912)
Sprong et al. (2006) identified homozygosity for a mutant allele
containing 2 missense mutations in cis in the CFD gene: a 638T-G
transversion, resulting in a val213-to-gly (V213G) substitution, and a
640T-C transition, resulting in a cys214-to-arg (C214R) substitution.
These mutations both occurred in conserved residues, and the C214R
change destroyed an internal disulfide bond between 2 conserved
cysteines. The unaffected parents and an unaffected sib were
heterozygous for the complex allele. The 19-month-old girl developed N.
meningitis and died in refractory shock about 47 hours after hospital
admission. Four years later, the 13-month-old brother was admitted to
the same hospital because of sudden onset of fever and a petechial rash.
At the age of 4 months, he had been hospitalized for a respiratory
syncytial virus infection complicated by bacterial superinfection. Blood
cultures grew N. meningitidis. Immunologic studies indicated that factor
D was undetectable. Because of this deficiency, the boy was put on
antibiotic prophylaxis and was vaccinated for N. meningitidis.

605451	TITLE *605451 p21 PROTEIN-ACTIVATED KINASE 4; PAK4
;;p21 CDC42/RAC1-ACTIVATED KINASE 4;;
KIAA1142
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PAK4 is a serine/threonine kinase that is a target for the small GTPase
CDC42 (116952). PAK4 regulates cell morphology, cytoskeletal
organization, and cell proliferation and migration. It can also function
as an antiapoptotic protein (summary by Qu et al., 2003).

For additional background information on p21-activated kinases (PAKs),
see PAK1 (602590).

CLONING

By PCR using Jurkat cell cDNA with degenerate primers corresponding to
the homologous regions between the kinase domains of yeast STE20 and
human PAK2 (605022), followed by screening Jurkat cell and fetal brain
cDNA libraries, Abo et al. (1998) obtained a cDNA encoding PAK4. The
predicted 591-amino acid PAK4 protein, which is approximately 50%
identical and 71% similar in the C-terminal kinase domain to other PAKS,
contains the 11 subdomains characteristic of serine/threonine kinases.
The PAK4 N-terminal regulatory region, which is well conserved among
other PAKs, shares no homology with other proteins except for a 16-amino
acid CDC42 (116952)/RAC (602048) GTPase-binding domain. Northern blot
analysis detected a 3.0-kb PAK4 transcript in all tissues tested, with
highest expression in prostate, testis, and colon.

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Hirosawa et al. (1999) cloned a PAK4 variant, which they called
KIAA1142. The transcript contains several repetitive elements in its
3-prime end.

GENE FUNCTION

Binding analysis by Abo et al. (1998) indicated that PAK4 interacts
tightly with GTP-bound but not GDP-bound CDC42 and weakly with RAC.
Functional analyses showed that PAK4 phosphorylates and
autophosphorylates and also activates the JNK (601158) pathway.
Coexpression of PAK4 and activated CDC42 induced the sustained formation
of actin-enriched filopodia protrusions and caused PAK4 to colocalize
with polymerized actin clusters and with beta coat protein (COPB;
600959) in the Golgi.

Gnesutta et al. (2001) found that overexpression of wildtype or
constitutively active PAK4 in HeLa and mouse NIH3T3 cells delayed the
onset of apoptosis in response to TNF-alpha (191160) stimulation,
ultraviolet irradiation, or serum starvation. Consistent with an
antiapoptotic function, expression of PAK4 led to increased
phosphorylation of the proapoptotic protein BAD (603167) and inhibition
of caspase (see 600636) activation.

HGF (142409), the ligand for the receptor tyrosine kinase MET (164860),
induces GAB1 (604439)-dependent remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton,
leading to epithelial cell dispersal, invasion, and morphogenesis. Using
mass spectrometry, Paliouras et al. (2009) found that endogenous PAK4
bound GAB1, but not GAB2 (606203) or GAB3 (300482), in transfected
HEK293 cells. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis revealed weak binding
between GAB1 and PAK4 in the absence of MET activation. HGF-dependent
MET activation in HeLa cells resulted in PAK4 activation via ser474
phosphorylation, followed by PAK4 translocation to membrane ruffles.
Translocation of PAK4 to membrane ruffles required PAK4 phosphorylation
and binding to GAB1, but it did not require PAK4 kinase activity.
Mutation analysis revealed that a GEFH1 (ARHGEF2; 607560)-binding domain
in PAK4 was required for binding to GAB1. Knockdown of Pak4 in MDCK
canine kidney cells abrogated HGF-dependent actin cytoskeletal
remodeling, cell dispersal, invasion, and tube formation. Paliouras et
al. (2009) concluded that PAK4 is a specific GAB1 effector downstream of
HGF signaling through MET.

MAPPING

Gross (2011) mapped the PAK4 gene to chromosome 19q13.2 based on an
alignment of the PAK4 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC002921) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

ANIMAL MODEL

Qu et al. (2003) found that Pak4 +/- mice appeared normal and were
fertile, whereas Pak4 -/- embryos died prior to embryonic day 11.5 with
defects in heart, brain, and neural tube. Pak4 -/- embryos appeared to
die due to cardiac malformation, with thinning of the myocardial walls
of the bulbus cordis and ventricle. Pak4 -/- embryos also showed
improper folding of the caudal neural tube and defects in motor neuron
development. Motor neuron progenitors appeared to form normally, but
their differentiation was largely inhibited, axonal outgrowth was
impaired, and neurons failed to migrate to their proper locations.

116890	TITLE *116890 CATHEPSIN E; CTSE
;;CATE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cathepsin E, an endolysosomal aspartic proteinase predominantly
expressed in cells of the immune system, has an important role in immune
responses (Yanagawa et al., 2007).

CLONING

Taggart et al. (1989) used sets of complementary oligonucleotide probes
specific for the highly conserved active site region of aspartic
proteinases to isolate cDNA clones encoding novel enzymes of this class.
They identified 6 classes of cDNA clones in a gastric adenocarcinoma
cDNA library using a set of 18-mer probes. One of the cDNAs, designated
AGS402, was shown by DNA analysis to correspond to the predicted coding
sequence of cathepsin E. Couvreur et al. (1989, 1990) also isolated a
full-length CTSE cDNA clone from a gastric adenocarcinoma cDNA library.

Azuma et al. (1989, 1989) reported the amino acid sequence of CTSE
predicted on the basis of the cDNA sequence and compared the sequence
with that of other aspartic proteinases. Azuma et al. (1992)
demonstrated that multiple transcripts result from alternative
polyadenylation of the primary transcripts of the single CTSE gene.

GENE STRUCTURE

Azuma et al. (1992) determined that the CTSE gene contains 9 exons and
spans 17.5 kb. The size and placement of the exons are highly conserved
relative to other aspartic proteinases.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis, Taggart et al. (1989) mapped the CTSE
gene to chromosome 1. Azuma et al. (1989, 1989) also assigned the CTSE
gene to chromosome 1.

Couvreur et al. (1989, 1990) mapped the CTSE gene to chromosome
1q23-qter by analysis of human/rodent hybrid cell lines containing
different X;1 translocations. CTSE was further localized to chromosome
1q31 by in situ hybridization.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yanagawa et al. (2007) found that cathepsin E deficiency in mice
resulted in a lysosome storage disorder in macrophages that was
characterized by accumulation of major lysosomal membrane
sialoglycoproteins, including Lamp1 (153330), Lamp2 (309060), and Limp2
(SCARB2; 602257), and elevated lysosomal pH. Trafficking of soluble
lysosomal proteins to lysosomes was also partially impaired in Cate -/-
macrophages. Treatment of wildtype macrophages with a cathepsin E
inhibitor also led to accumulation of these lysosomal proteins and
elevated pH. Since vacuolar-type H(+) ATPase (see 603097) activity was
not altered in Cate -/- macrophages, Yanagawa et al. (2007) hypothesized
that the elevated lysosomal pH in Cate -/- macrophages was likely due to
the accumulation of the highly acidic lysosomal sialoglycoproteins.

611786	TITLE *611786 MEDIATOR OF CELL MOTILITY 1; MEMO1
;;MEMO;;
C2ORF4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In a search for proteins that are required for ERBB2 (164870)-dependent
cell motility, a marker for more aggressive metastatic cancers, Marone
et al. (2004) used a phosphorylated peptide of ErbB2 in
immunoprecipitation experiments. One of the precipitated proteins,
identified by mass spectrometry, was a 33-kD product of a novel gene,
which the authors named MEMO (mediator of ERBB2-driven cell motility).
The predicted protein contains 297 amino acids. Marone et al. (2004)
noted that MEMO does not contain a predicted SH2- or
PTB-phosphotyrosine-binding domain and suggested it may interact with
ERBB2 through SHC (600560). A MEMO-specific siRNA was shown to markedly
reduce cell motility.

Qiu et al. (2008) determined the crystal structure of MEMO and showed it
to be homologous to class III nonheme iron-dependent dioxygenases.
Unlike MEMO proteins in other species, however, there was no evidence
for metal binding in the human protein. Qiu et al. (2008) showed that
human MEMO directly binds to the ERBB2 phosphopeptide using a vestigial
(dioxygenase) enzymatic active site.

MAPPING

Scott (2008) mapped the MEMO1 gene to chromosome 2p22-p21 based on an
alignment of the MEMO1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB041018) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.2).

608359	TITLE *608359 SULFOTRANSFERASE FAMILY 4A, MEMBER 1; SULT4A1
;;BRAIN SULFOTRANSFERASE-LIKE PROTEIN 1; BRSTL1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SULT4A1 belongs to the sulfotransferase family, which is involved in the
metabolism of endogenous chemicals, such as thyroid hormones, steroids,
and monoamine neurotransmitters, as well as drugs and xenobiotics.
Conjugation with a charged sulfonate moiety usually decreases the
biologic activity of the compound and increases its aqueous solubility
and excretion (summary by Falany et al., 2000).

CLONING

By differential display to identify transcripts enriched in islet cells
relative to pancreatic exocrine tissue, Ferrer et al. (1997) obtained a
partial SULT4A1 sequence. Using this sequence to probe an insulinoma
cDNA library, Falany et al. (2000) isolated partial SULT4A1 cDNAs
containing intronic sequences. By screening a brain cDNA library, they
cloned full-length SULT4A1, which they called BRSTL1. The deduced
284-amino acid SULT4A1 protein has a calculated molecular mass of about
33.1 kD. It contains an N-terminal 3-prime-phosphoadenosine
5-prime-phosphosulfate (PAPS)-binding site, a putative active-site
histidine (his111), and a central motif involved in PAPS binding.
SULT4A1 shares 30% to 36% amino acid identity with several other
sulfotransferases. Northern blot analysis detected expression of SULT4A1
in brain, but not in heart, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle,
kidney, or pancreas. RT-PCR of liver RNA generated a SULT4A1 product
identical to the cDNA isolated from brain except for the inclusion of a
126-bp insert. The insert, which is located at a position corresponding
to intron 7 of several human SULT genes, contains several stop codons.
This transcript was also detected in several pancreatic cell lines.

Sakakibara et al. (2002) cloned mouse Sult4a1. By searching databases
using the mouse sequence and RT-PCR of a brain cDNA library, they cloned
human SULT4A1. The mouse and human proteins share 97.9% amino acid
identity. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues showed expression of
Sult4a1 only in brain, cerebellum, and hypothalamus. By mRNA dot blot
analysis of human tissues, expression was detected in spinal cord and in
all brain regions examined. Recombinant mouse and human SULT4A1
expressed in E. coli both had an apparent molecular mass of about 33 kD
by SDS-PAGE.

GENE FUNCTION

Sakakibara et al. (2002) assayed the sulfotransferase activity of
recombinant mouse and human SULT4A1 using radiolabeled PAPS as the
sulfate donor. Both enzymes utilized a variety of endogenous and
xenobiotic compounds, including L-triiodothyronine, thyroxine, estrone,
p-nitrophenol, 2-naphthylamine, and 2-naphthol. Using mouse brain
homogenate as substrate in the sulfotransferase assay, they found 4
distinct brain compounds sulfated by both mouse and human SULT4A1.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SULT4A1
gene to chromosome 22 (TMAP A001X01).

607052	TITLE *607052 TUMOR SUPPRESSOR CANDIDATE 2; TUSC2
;;FUS1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By physical cloning methodologies and bioinformatic computational
analyses, Lerman and Minna (2000) identified a number of genes,
including FUS1, in a region of chromosome 3p21.3 that is associated with
a putative lung cancer tumor suppressor gene. The deduced 110-amino acid
FUS1 protein is 93% identical to the mouse protein and is probably
cytoplasmic. A worm protein, C09e9.1, is approximately 41% identical and
contains a bipartite nuclear localization signal. Northern blot analysis
revealed wide expression of a 1.8-kb transcript that was strongest in
heart, lung, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas, followed by brain
and liver, with lowest levels in placenta. Moderate expression was
detectable in most lung cancer cell lines examined. Mutations were found
in approximately 5% of cell lines tested, but none of the genes
identified in the search had a high frequency of mutations. Lerman and
Minna (2000) suggested that FUS1 is a candidate for functional tumor
suppressor gene studies.

GENE FUNCTION

Lee et al. (2007) found that expression of miR378 (MIRN378; 611957)
enhanced cell survival and reduced caspase-3 (CASP3; 600636) activity in
human glioma cells. Injection of miR378-expressing glioma cells into
nude mice showed that miR378 promoted tumor growth and angiogenesis. Lee
et al. (2007) identified miR378 target sequences in the 3-prime UTRs of
SUFU (607035) and FUS1 transcripts, and they found that miR378
downregulated expression of both transcripts. Transfection and
overexpression of either SUFU or FUS1 overcame the growth-promoting
effects of miR378. Expression of miR378 repressed expression of reporter
gene constructs harboring the miR378 target sites of SUFU or FUS1.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Lerman and Minna (2000) determined that
the FUS1 gene spans 3.3 kb and contains 3 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Lerman and Minna (2000) determined that
the FUS1 gene resides in a 120-kb critical region for a lung cancer
tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 3p21.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Lerman and Minna (2000) identified a FUS1 mutation in 2 nonsmall cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines that resulted in a 28-bp truncation at
the 3-prime end of exon 2 and a predicted protein of only 82 amino
acids.

Using SSCP and CpG island promoter methylation analyses, Kondo et al.
(2001) failed to detect mutations, polymorphisms, or methylation of FUS1
in lung cancer specimens. Western blot analysis indicated low or no
expression of FUS1 in lung cancer cell lines. Overexpression of
transfected wildtype but not mutant FUS1 in NSCLCs led to the detection
of an approximately 20-kD protein and a dramatic reduction in
colony-forming cells. Ecdysone-induced expression of FUS1 had the same
effects. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that the arrest occurred in
G1 phase.

614957	TITLE *614957 SCHLAFEN FAMILY, MEMBER 13; SLFN13
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The Schlafen (SFLN) family contains 9 mouse and 6 human genes, including
SLFN13, that encode proteins with a conserved N terminus containing a
putative AAA ATPase domain. Longer SLFN proteins have C-terminal motifs
resembling DNA/RNA helicase domains. Studies in mouse have implicated
SLFN proteins in regulation of cell growth and T-cell development
(summary by Geserick et al. (2004) and Li et al. (2012)).

CLONING

Geserick et al. (2004) identified mouse Slfn5 (614952), Slfn8, Slfn9,
and Slfn10, which encode proteins that share significant homology with
mouse Slfn1 through Slfn4 in their N-terminal halves, but contain unique
C-terminal extensions with motifs homologous to DNA/RNA helicases.
Slfn8, Slfn9, and Slfn10 share 85 to 87% amino acid identity with one
another, whereas Slfn5 is more distantly related to the former group,
sharing 40% identity.

Van Zuylen et al. (2011) noted that human SLFN11 (614953) and SLFN13 are
orthologous to mouse Slfn8, Slfn9, and Slfn10.

MAPPING

Gross (2012) mapped the SLFN13 gene to chromosome 17q12 based on an
alignment of the SLFN13 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC136622) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

Bustos et al. (2009) found that the SLFN genes are clustered within the
same orthologous region flanked by the UNC45 (UNC45B; 611220) and PEX12
(601758) genes in all mammalian genomes examined. The human and mouse
SLFN clusters are located on chromosomes 17 and 11, respectively.

GENE FUNCTION

- Putative Mouse Orthologs of SLFN13

Using Northern blot analysis, Geserick et al. (2004) detected expression
of most mouse SLFN genes examined in Listeria monocytogenes-infected
mouse splenocytes, with little or no expression in uninfected mouse
cells. Ifngr (107470) was required for Slfn5, Slfn8, Slfn9, and Slfn10
upregulation. Further analysis showed that mouse SLFNs were
differentially regulated in developing thymocytes, in activated
peripheral T cells, in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- or interferon-gamma
(IFNG; 147570)-activated macrophages, or during terminal myeloid
differentiation of M1 leukemia cells. Transgenic expression in mice
revealed that dysregulated expression of Slfn8 negatively influenced
thymocyte development and impaired the response of peripheral T cells to
T-cell receptor (see 186880)-mediated stimulation. Geserick et al.
(2004) concluded that SLFN genes are integrated into regulatory networks
that control T-cell development and activation.

EVOLUTION

Bustos et al. (2009) used genomic and phylogenetic studies to
investigate the evolution and role of the SLFN gene family. They found
that the SLFN family is widely distributed in mammals, with 4 major
clades that underwent lineage-specific expansions or contractions in
various orders, including primates and rodents. Bustos et al. (2009)
also identified SLFN family members in Chondrichthyes and Amphibia. They
found evidence that positive selection has acted on many SLFN genes. A
member of the SLFN family was horizontally transferred from mouse to
orthopoxviruses, where the authors hypothesized it plays a role in
allowing the virus to survive host defense mechanisms. The viral SLFN
sequences are evolving under purifying selection, indicating their
functional relevance.

Van Zuylen et al. (2011) noted that only 2 SLFN family members, SLFN5
and SLFN14 (614958), have direct orthologs in mouse and human,
consistent with rapid evolution of the SLFN family across mammalian
species. Human SLFN12 (614955) and SLFN12L (614956) have 4 orthologs in
mice (Slfn1, Slfn2, Slfn3, and Slfn4), and human SLFN11 and SLFN13 have
3 orthologs in mice (Slfn8, Slfn9, and Slfn10).

;;ARD1 N-ACETYLTRANSFERASE, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF, A; ARD1A;;
ARREST-DEFECTIVE PROTEIN 1; ARD1;;
TE2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

N-alpha-acetylation is one of the most common protein modifications that
occurs during protein synthesis and involves the transfer of an acetyl
group from acetyl-coenzyme A to the protein alpha-amino group. ARD1A,
together with NATH (NARG1, NAA15; 608000), is part of a major
N-alpha-acetyltransferase complex responsible for alpha-acetylation of
proteins and peptides (Sanchez-Puig and Fersht, 2006).

CLONING

Tribioli et al. (1994) described the physical and transcriptional
organization of a region of 140 kb in Xq28, 5-prime to the L1CAM gene
(308840). They established a transcriptional map of the region by
isolating and mapping CpG islands to the physical map, determining
partial nucleotide sequences, and studying the pattern of expression and
orientation of the transcripts. They succeeded in positioning 4
previously identified genes: L1CAM, AVPR2 (300538), HFC1 (300019), and
RENBP (312420). All genes in the region are rather small, ranging in
size from 2 to 30 kb, and very close to one another. With the exception
of the AVPR2 gene, they serve a housekeeping function, having a CpG
island at their 5-prime end and the same orientation of transcription.
This kind of organization is consistent with the one previously
described for the more distal portion of Xq28, between the color vision
pigment genes and the G6PD gene and indicates that genes with a
housekeeping and tissue-specific pattern of expression are interspersed
in the genome but are probably found in different 'transcriptional
domains' (characterized by different orientation). Three new genes were
identified and positioned. One of these, termed TE2, demonstrated 40%
identity with the ARD1 protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Whiteway and
Szostak, 1985), a protein required for the expression of an N-terminal
protein acetyltransferase activity.

Using Northern blot analysis, Sugiura et al. (2003) showed mouse Ard1
was ubiquitously expressed. By database analysis and PCR, Kim et al.
(2006) identified 3 splice variants of mouse Ard1 and 2 splice variants
of human ARD1. The mouse variants encoded proteins of 235-, 225-, and
198-amino acids. Ard1(235) and Ard1(225) have well-conserved
N-acetyltransferase domains, but Ard1(198) has only a partial domain.
The human ARD1 variants encoded proteins of 131- and 235-amino acids.
The C-terminal region of mouse Ard1(225) differs from that of both mouse
and human ARD1(235), likely due to alternative splicing of exon 8.
Western blot analysis of human cell lines showed a major intense band of
about 32 kD, which corresponded to ARD1(235). In contrast, mouse
fibroblasts strongly expressed a 30-kD protein, corresponding to
Ard1(225).

Asaumi et al. (2005) cloned ARD1 and identified it as a potential APP
(104760)-binding protein in a yeast 2-hybrid assay. The 235-amino acid
protein contains an N-acetyltransferase domain, a highly conserved
acetyl-coenzyme A binding motif, and a C-terminal APP-binding domain.

GENE FUNCTION

N-terminal protein acetylation is one of the most common protein
modifications which appears to play a role in many biologic processes.
The most extensively studied acetylated proteins are the 4 histones,
which in all eukaryotic cells organize the nucleosome particles and are
subject to an enzyme-catalyzed cycle of acetylation and deacetylation
which plays a role in chromatin structure, transcriptional activation,
and cell cycle transit. Lack of acetylation of histone H4 distinguishes
the inactive from the active mammalian X chromosome (Jeppesen and
Turner, 1993).

Using the yeast 2-hybrid system to identify proteins that interact with
the ODD domain of HIF1A (603348), Jeong et al. (2002) identified mouse
Ard1. They established the function of Ard1 as a protein
acetyltransferase in mammalian cells by direct binding to HIF1A to
regulate its stability. Jeong et al. (2002) also showed that
Ard1-mediated acetylation enhances interaction of HIF1A with VHL
(608537) and HIF1A ubiquitination, suggesting that the acetylation of
HIF1A by ARD1 is critical to proteasomal degradation. They concluded
that the role of ARD1 in the acetylation of HIF1A provides a key
regulatory mechanism underlying HIF1A stability. By assaying ARD1
variants expressed in HeLa cells, Kim et al. (2006) determined that
mouse Ard1(225), but not mouse or human ARD1(235) strongly decreased
VEGF (192240) mRNA expression under hypoxic conditions. As described by
Jeong et al. (2002), Ard1(225) mediated epsilon-acetylation of a HIF1A
lysine residue; however, mouse and human ARD1(235) had weaker effects.
Kim et al. (2006) concluded that the different ARD1 isoforms may have
different effects on HIF1A stability and acetylation.

Using in vitro translated mouse proteins, Sugiura et al. (2003) showed
that Ard1 and Narg1, which they called Nat1, assembled to form a
functional acetyltransferase. Narg1 alone showed no activity.
Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis demonstrated that Narg1
and Ard1 coassembled in mammalian cells. By cotransfection of rat kidney
fibroblasts, they showed that Narg1 and Ard1 localized to the cytoplasm
in both overlapping and separate compartments. In situ hybridization
demonstrated that during mouse brain development, Narg1 and Ard1 were
highly expressed in areas of cell division and migration, and their
expression appeared to be downregulated as neurons differentiated. Narg1
and Ard1 were expressed in proliferating mouse embryonic carcinoma
cells. Treatment of these cells with retinoic acid initiated neuronal
differentiation and downregulation of Narg1 and Ard1 as a neuronal
marker gene was induced. Sugiura et al. (2003) concluded that NARG1 and
ARD1 play a role in the generation and differentiation of neurons.

Asaumi et al. (2005) confirmed interaction of APP with ARD1 in mammalian
cells by coimmunoprecipitation studies. Using human ACTH as a substrate,
they showed that the ARD1/NATH (NARG1; 608000) complex has strong
N-terminal transferase activity. Immunoprecipitation and Western
blotting experiments showed that ARD1 and NATH formed a complex in
HEK293 cells. Because APP-binding proteins can modulate APP metabolism,
they tested the ability of ARD1 to modulate beta-amyloid-40 secretion
and found that coexpression of both ARD1 and NATH was required to
suppress beta-amyloid-40 generation from APP. APP endocytosis assay in
HEK293 cells showed that ARD1 and NATH suppressed endocytosis of APP.

Using reciprocal immunoprecipitation, followed by mass spectroscopic
analysis, Arnesen et al. (2005) showed that endogenous ARD1 and NATH
formed stable complexes in several human cell lines and that the complex
showed N-terminal acetylation activity. Mutation analysis and
examination of proteolytic fragments indicated that interaction was
mediated through an N-terminal domain of ARD1 and the C-terminal end of
NATH. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed ARD1 and NATH associated with
several ribosomal proteins. ARD1 and NATH were also detected in isolated
polysomes; however, they were predominantly nonpolysomal. Endogenous
ARD1 was present in both the nuclei and cytoplasm in several human cell
lines, whereas NATH was predominantly in the cytoplasm, despite the
presence of a well-defined nuclear localization signal within the NATH
coiled-coil region. Both ARD1 and NATH were cleaved in a
caspase-dependent manner during apoptosis in stressed HeLa cells, which
resulted in reduced acetylation activity.

Using size-exclusion chromatography, circular dichroism, and
fluorescence spectroscopy, Sanchez-Puig and Fersht (2006) found that
ARD1 consists of a compact globular region comprising two-thirds of the
protein and a flexible unstructured C terminus. In addition, ARD1 could
assume a misfolded conformation and form amyloid protofilaments under
physiologic conditions of pH and temperature. The process was
accelerated by thermal denaturation and high protein concentration.
Limited proteolysis of ARD1 protofilaments revealed a
proteolysis-resistant core within the acetyltransferase domain.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Rope et al. (2011) identified a missense mutation in the NAA10 gene
(ser37 to pro; 300013.0001) in 2 families segregating a lethal X-linked
recessive disorder of infancy, designated Ogden syndrome (OGDNS;
300855), characterized by an aged appearance due to lack of subcutaneous
fat and loose skin, and craniofacial anomalies including prominent eyes,
large ears, downslanting palpebral fissures, flared nares, hypoplastic
alae, short columella, protruding upper lip, and microretrognathia. The
boys had initial hypotonia progressing to hypertonia, global
developmental delay, usually unilateral cryptorchidism, and cardiac
arrhythmias leading to death in the first or second year of life.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
OGDEN SYNDROME
NAA10, SER37PRO

Rope et al. (2011) identified 2 unrelated families segregating a lethal
X-linked disorder, Ogden syndrome (OGDNS; 300855). The 2 families had
independent occurrences of a T-to-C transition at nucleotide 109 of the
NAA10 gene, resulting in a serine-to-proline substitution at codon 37
(S37P). The NAA10 gene encodes the catalytic subunit of the N-terminal
acetyltransferase. Substitution of proline for serine at position 37 is
likely to affect structure, and in vitro assays of protein function
demonstrated 60 to 80% reduction in NAT activity of the mutant protein
toward the in vivo substrate RNase P protein p30 (606115). In contrast,
the activity toward the substrate high mobility group protein A1
(600701) was reduced by only 20%.

604083	TITLE *604083 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 142; ZNF142
DESCRIPTION Transcriptional regulatory proteins containing tandemly repeated zinc
finger domains are thought to be involved in both normal and abnormal
cellular proliferation and differentiation. One abundant class of such
transcriptional regulators resembles the Drosophila Kruppel segmentation
gene product due to the presence of repeated Cys2-His2 (C2H2) zinc
finger domains that are connected by conserved sequences, called H/C
links. See ZNF91 (603971) for general information on zinc finger
proteins.

By screening a human insulinoma cDNA library with a degenerate
oligonucleotide corresponding to the H/C linker sequence, Tommerup et
al. (1993) isolated cDNAs potentially encoding zinc finger proteins.
Tommerup and Vissing (1995) performed sequence analysis on a number of
these cDNAs and identified several novel zinc finger protein genes,
including ZNF142. The ZNF142 cDNA predicts a protein belonging to the
Kruppel family of zinc finger proteins.

By sequencing random cDNAs corresponding to relatively long transcripts,
Nagase et al. (1996) identified a cDNA encoding ZNF142, which they
called KIAA0236. The deduced ZNF142 protein has 1,687 amino acids.
Northern blot analysis detected ZNF142 expression in all 16 human
tissues examined.

Nagase et al. (1996) mapped the ZNF142 gene to chromosome 2 using a
radiation hybrid mapping panel. By FISH, Tommerup and Vissing (1995)
mapped the ZNF142 gene to 2q34-q35.

611846	TITLE *611846 MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN L41; MRPL41
;;MRPL27
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mitochondria have their own translation system for production of 13
proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation. MRPL41 is 1 of more
than 70 protein components of mitochondrial ribosomes that are encoded
by the nuclear genome (Kenmochi et al., 2001).

CLONING

By searching databases for homologs of rat Mrpl27, Goldschmidt-Reisin et
al. (1998) identified mouse and human MRPL41, which they called MRPL27.
The deduced 136-amino acid human MRPL41 protein contains a 13-amino acid
N-terminal mitochondrial import signal.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis and analysis of an integrated BAC-STS map,
Kenmochi et al. (2001) mapped the MRPL41 gene to chromosome 9q34.3.

120290	TITLE *120290 COLLAGEN, TYPE XI, ALPHA-2; COL11A2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Type XI collagen, a fibril-forming collagen found mainly in the
cartilage extracellular matrix, is important for the integrity and
development of the skeleton (summary by Lui et al., 1996).

CLONING

Kimura et al. (1989) cloned human COL11A2, which encodes a deduced
protein with high sequence similarity to COL11A1 (120280). By Northern
blot analysis, Kimura et al. (1989) showed that COL11A2 is expressed in
cartilage but not in adult liver, skin, and tendon.

MAPPING

Law et al. (1989, 1990) used a cosmid clone containing the COL11A2 gene
as a probe in the Southern blot analysis of DNA from a panel of
human/hamster somatic cell hybrids containing different numbers and
combinations of human chromosomes. They concluded that the gene is
located on chromosome 6, and study of a cell hybrid containing only 6q
indicated that the COL11A2 gene is on 6p.

By a combination of somatic cell hybrid mapping and in situ
hybridization, Hanson et al. (1989, 1989) localized the COL11A2 gene to
6p21.3. By physical mapping of the class II HLA region using pulsed
field gel electrophoresis, Hanson et al. (1991) demonstrated that the
COL11A2 gene is about 45 kb centromeric to HLA-DPA1 (142880) and is
transcribed in the opposite (i.e., telomeric) direction.

Kimura et al. (1989) assigned the COL11A2 gene to 6p21.2 by in situ
hybridization. The nucleotide sequence showed that although type XI
collagen belongs to the fibril-forming class of collagens, there are
substantial differences in exon sizes at the 3-prime end of the gene
when comparing the COL11A2 gene with the genes for types I, II, and III
collagens. It is thought that the alpha-3 chain of type XI collagen is a
posttranslational variant of the type II, or cartilage, collagen
subunit, i.e., is encoded by the COL2A1 gene (120140).

Stubbs et al. (1993) showed that the homologous gene in the mouse is
also 'embedded' within the major histocompatibility complex on
chromosome 17.

GENE STRUCTURE

Vuoristo et al. (1995) analyzed the COL11A2 gene from 2 overlapping
cosmid clones that had previously been isolated in the course of
searching the human major histocompatibility region. Nucleotide sequence
defined over 28,000 bp of the gene. It was shown to contain 66 exons. As
with most genes for fibrillar collagens, the first intron was among the
largest, and the introns at the 5-prime end of the gene were in general
larger than the introns at the 3-prime end. Analysis of the exons coding
for the major triple helical domain indicated that the gene structure
had not evolved with the genes for the major fibrillar collagen and that
there were marked differences in the number of exons, the exon sizes,
and codon usage. The gene was located close to the gene for the retinoid
X receptor beta (180246) in a head-to-tail arrangement similar to that
previously seen with the 2 mouse genes. Also, there was marked
interspecies homology in the intergenic sequences.

Lui et al. (1996) showed that COL11A2 contains at least 62 exons
spanning 30.5 kb. The gene differs from other collagens in that the
amino propeptide is encoded by 14 exons rather than the usual 5 to 8.
The promoter is GC-rich and lacks a TATA box. The authors believed that
the gene is likely to undergo alternative splicing. The gene lies within
the MHC region and is only 1.1-kb from the retinoid X receptor-beta
(180246) and about 40 kb from DPB2 (142880).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Melkoniemi et al. (2000) stated that in spite of partial overlap between
the Stickler (see 108300), Marshall (154780), Weissenbacher-Zweymuller
(277610), and otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia (OSMED; 215150)
phenotypes caused by mutations in the COL2A1 (120140), COL11A1 (120280),
and COL11A2 genes, absence of eye involvement in patients carrying
COL11A2 mutations is noteworthy. This was best explained by the finding
that the COL11A2 gene is not expressed in the vitreous body and that the
COL5A2 (120190) chain replaces the COL11A2 chain in the ocular vitreous
(Mayne et al., 1993).

- Stickler Syndrome, Type III

Type II collagen is closely associated with both type IX collagen
(120210) and type XI collagen in thin collagen fibrils of hyaline
cartilage. This prompted Brunner et al. (1994) to study linkage of a
Stickler syndrome phenotype (STL3; 184840) to polymorphic markers within
or near genes encoding these cartilage collagens. In a large Dutch
kindred, Stickler syndrome was found to be linked to the 6p22-p21.3
region where COL11A2 maps. Unlike the usual cases of Stickler syndrome
which show high myopia, vitreoretinal degeneration, and retinal
detachment, ocular features were lacking in all affected individuals in
the Dutch family. This may be explained by absence of the alpha-2 chain
of type XI collagen in the vitreous. The skeletal and otologic
manifestations of the Stickler syndrome were present in the family,
however. Vikkula et al. (1995) established that the affected members of
the Dutch kindred with Stickler syndrome reported by Brunner et al.
(1994) had a mutation in the COL11A2 gene (120290.0001).

Sirko-Osadsa et al. (1998) described a family with Stickler syndrome in
which there was no eye involvement and demonstrated that the phenotype
was due to heterozygosity for a 27-bp deletion in the COL11A2 gene
(120290.0003). The affected members of the family had sensorineural
hearing loss, cleft palate/uvula, micrognathia, malar flattening, joint
pains, and multiple hereditary exostoses.

- Weissenbacher-Zweymuller Syndrome

Pihlajamaa et al. (1998) demonstrated that the original patient
described by Weissenbacher and Zweymuller (1964) as a 'combination of a
Pierre Robin syndrome with a fetal chondrodysplasia' (WZS; 277610) had a
heterozygous mutation in the COL11A2 gene (120290.0004).

- Otospondylomegaepiphyseal Dysplasia

Vikkula et al. (1995) studied a Dutch kindred in which 3 sibs of a
consanguineous mating had a severe degenerative joint disease resembling
osteoarthritis that presented in early adulthood and affected
predominantly the hips, knees, elbows, and shoulders (OSMED; 215150).
Vikkula et al. (1995) found that the mutation in these sibs was a
gly175-to-arg mutation of the COL11A2 gene (120290.0002). van Steensel
et al. (1997) described the clinical and radiographic features of
otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia in these sibs.

Melkoniemi et al. (2000) reported 7 families with OSMED. All affected
individuals had a remarkably similar phenotype: profound sensorineural
hearing loss, skeletal dysplasia with limb shortening and large
epiphyses, cleft palate, very flat face, hypoplasia of the mandible, a
short nose with anteverted nares, and a flat nasal bridge. A different
mutation of the COL11A2 gene was identified in each family. In 4
families, including 3 with consanguineous parents, the mutations were
homozygous. Individuals in 3 other families, in which parents were
nonconsanguineous, were compound heterozygous. Of the 10 identified
mutations, 9 were predicted to cause premature termination of
translation, and 1 was predicted to cause an in-frame deletion.

In an Egyptian brother and sister with OSMED, Temtamy et al. (2006)
identified homozygosity for a 1-bp deletion in the COL11A2 gene
(120290.0011). The first-cousin parents were heterozygous for the
deletion; a younger brother was unaffected.

- Deafness, Autosomal Dominant 13

In 2 families, 1 American and 1 Dutch, with autosomal dominant,
nonsyndromic hearing loss (DFNA13; 601868) previously been mapped to 6p,
McGuirt et al. (1999) identified heterozygous mutations in the COL11A2
gene (120290.0005-120290.0006) that were predicted to affect the
triple-helix domain of the collagen protein. McGuirt et al. (1999) found
that mice with a targeted disruption of Col11a2 also showed hearing
loss. Electron microscopy of the tectorial membrane of these mice
revealed loss of organization of the collagen fibrils. The findings
revealed a unique ultrastructural malformation of the inner ear
architecture associated with nonsyndromic hearing loss, and suggested
that tectorial membrane abnormalities may be one etiology of
sensorineural hearing loss primarily affecting the mid-frequencies.

- Deafness, Autosomal Recessive 53

In 5 affected members of 2 sibships of a consanguineous Iranian family
with nonsyndromic hearing loss (DFNB53; 609706), Chen et al. (2005)
identified homozygosity for a missense mutation in the COL11A2 gene
(P621T; 120290.0008). The 4 parents and 1 sib were heterozygous for the
mutation.

- Fibrochondrogenesis 2

In a deceased infant with fibrochondrogenesis (FBCG2; 614524), born of
consanguineous parents, Tompson et al. (2012) identified homozygosity
for a splice site mutation in the COL11A2 gene (120290.0012). In another
deceased infant with fibrochondrogenesis, who was born of healthy
nonconsanguineous parents, they identified heterozygosity for a 9-bp
deletion (120290.0013).

- Associations Pending Confirmation

Among Japanese, ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament of
the spine (OPLL; 602475) is a leading cause of myelopathy, showing
ectopic bone formation in the paravertebral ligament. Maeda et al.
(2001) provided genetic evidence that the COL11A2 locus constitutes
susceptibility for OPLL. Five distinct SNPs identified in COL11A2 were
combined to construct haplotypes. A male-specific association with a
COL11A2 haplotype was found with OPLL. In a case-control study of 711
Japanese individuals with OPLL and 896 controls, Horikoshi et al. (2006)
found no association between 2 SNPs in the COL11A2 gene and OPLL.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
STICKLER SYNDROME, TYPE III
COL11A2, IVS, G-A, +1

In a large Dutch kindred with Stickler syndrome (184840), which was
found by Brunner et al. (1994) to map to the same region of 6p as the
COL11A2 gene, Vikkula et al. (1995) found heterozygosity for a 1-bp
change at the exon-intron boundary such that the intronic donor-site
sequence, GTGAG, was replaced by ATGAG. This change created a novel
NlaIII restriction site in the genomic sequence. The G-to-A transition
resulted in a 54-bp in-frame deletion, which represented deletion of the
exon 5-prime of the mutation. This exon sequence was located 108
nucleotides upstream of the junction between sequences encoding the
triple-helical and C-propeptide domains of the alpha-2(XI) chain.

.0002
OTOSPONDYLOMEGAEPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA
COL11A2, GLY175ARG

Vikkula et al. (1995) studied a Dutch kindred in which 3 sibs had a
severe degenerative joint disease resembling osteoarthritis that
presented in early adulthood and affected predominantly the hips, knees,
elbows, and shoulders (215150). The spine was less severely affected,
and adult height was only slightly below that of the unaffected sibs.
There was increased lumbar lordosis and prominent interphalangeal
joints. Short fifth metacarpals were found in all 3 sibs. The patients
had distinctive facial features with midface hypoplasia with a short
upturned nose, prominent eyes, depressed nasal bridge, and prominent
supraorbital ridges. Sensorineural hearing loss was present from birth
and required the use of hearing aids in all 3 affected sibs. None of the
3 had myopia or vitreoretinal degeneration. The parents were fourth
cousins. The affected sibs were found to be homozygous for an extended
haplotype of 7 CA dinucleotide repeat polymorphisms from 6p21 near the
COL11A2 locus. Using conservative estimates of 0.002 for the frequency
of the abnormal allele and 0.005 for the frequency of the marker
haplotype, Vikkula et al. (1995) obtained a lod score of 3.09 at theta =
0.0 for linkage of the disease phenotype to 6p21. To find the mutation
causing the autosomal recessive disorder, they used RT-PCR with total
RNA extracted from EBV-transformed lymphoblasts, and the complete coding
sequence of the COL11A2 gene was determined for 1 individual. This
identified a G-to-A transition, converting a glycyl to an arginyl codon,
within the triple-helical domain of the alpha-2(XI) chain. The change in
sequence eliminated an MspI restriction site. Affected children were
homozygous for the arginyl codon, while unaffected children were
homozygous for the glycyl codon; both parents were heterozygous for the
sequence change. The mutation occurred in a Gly-X-Y triplet. The
clinical findings in the 3 sibs with the gly175-to-arg missense mutation
were described by van Steensel et al. (1997).

.0003
STICKLER SYNDROME, TYPE III
COL11A2, 27-BP DEL

In a family with type III Stickler syndrome (184840), Sirko-Osadsa et
al. (1998) identified a 27-bp deletion within exon 39 of the COL11A2
gene.

.0004
WEISSENBACHER-ZWEYMULLER SYNDROME
OTOSPONDYLOMEGAEPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA, HETEROZYGOUS, INCLUDED
COL11A2, GLY955GLU

Weissenbacher and Zweymuller (1964) described a newborn boy of normal
size who presented with a 'combination of a Pierre Robin syndrome with a
fetal chondrodysplasia' (277610). The child had a markedly snub nose,
cleft palate, micrognathia, glossoptosis, rhizomelic shortness of the
limbs with dumbbell-shaped femora, and coronal vertebral clefts. A
follow-up report when the original WZS patient was 18 years old (Giedion
et al., 1982) indicated that he had developed sensorineural deafness at
about 5 years of age, and a spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia with enlarged
epiphyses of the long bones, radiologically most pronounced at the age
of 13.5 years. At age 18, he was normal in height (164 cm) and in
appearance except for slightly shorter limbs and lower segment. Also, he
had no ocular signs or symptoms. His parents were healthy and
nonconsanguineous. A brother was unaffected. Giedion et al. (1982)
reported 3 additional patients with the same condition and suggested
that they should be classified as otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia
(OSMED; 215150); common findings in patients of the OSMED group were
midface hypoplasia, cleft palate, micrognathia, sensorineural deafness,
normal eyes, and spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia with large epiphyses.
Pihlajamaa et al. (1998) analyzed the original WZS patient for mutations
in 2 collagen genes expressed in cartilage, COL2A1 and COL11A2. No
mutations were found in the COL2A1 gene but the COL11A2 gene contained a
G-to-A transition that converted codon 955 from an obligate glycine
(GGG) in the major triple helix of the protein to a codon for glutamate
(GAG). The mutation was present in heterozygous state.

.0005
DEAFNESS, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT 13
COL11A2, ARG549CYS

In affected members of an American family with autosomal dominant
nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss (DFNA13; 601868), McGuirt et al.
(1999) identified a heterozygous C-to-T missense mutation in exon 42
that predicted an arg549-to-cys amino acid substitution.

.0006
DEAFNESS, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT 13
COL11A2, GLY323GLU

In affected members of a Dutch family with autosomal dominant
nonsyndromic sensorineural deafness (DFNA13; 601868), McGuirt et al.
(1999) found a heterozygous G-to-A transition in exon 31 that predicted
a gly323-to-glu amino acid substitution.

.0007
OTOSPONDYLOMEGAEPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA
COL11A2, SER345TER

In a family from Morocco with consanguineous parents, Melkoniemi et al.
(2000) found that 3 children with OSMED (215150) were homozygous for a
C-to-A transversion at nucleotide 2492 in exon 33 of the COL11A2 gene,
resulting in a ser345-to-ter substitution. One of the children was
described as having normal body length at birth, but short limbs with
enlarged joints and stiff interphalangeal joints were noted. The
radiologic features included vertebral coronal clefts, square iliac
wings and a thick ischium, large metaphyses of the long bones, and
enlarged epiphyses of the elbows and knees. At age 7 years, she was of
nearly normal height, but disproportionate, and her palate was extremely
narrow, with a double row of teeth. Eye examination revealed slight
myopia.

.0008
STICKLER SYNDROME, TYPE III
COL11A2, ARG893TER

In affected members of a 3-generation family with type III Stickler
syndrome (184840), Vuoristo et al. (2004) identified a heterozygous
C-to-T transition in exon 57 of the COL11A2 gene, resulting in an
arg893-to-ter (R893X) substitution. The mutation induced skipping of
exon 57 in 1 allele, resulting in an in-frame deletion of 18 amino
acids. Sensorineural hearing loss was present in all 3 generations. The
propositus was a 4-year-old boy who had Robin sequence at birth. Both
the propositus and his father had a flat malar area and nasal bridge,
and the nose was upturned. The father had symptoms and radiologic
findings of osteoarthritis from the age of 29 years. At age 73 years,
the affected grandmother showed extensive osteoarthritic changes in the
spine. Her father had undergone hip replacement in midadulthood.

.0009
WEISSENBACHER-ZWEYMULLER SYNDROME, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
COL11A2, ARG845TER

In 5 individuals from a consanguineous Israeli Bedouin family with
autosomal recessive Weissenbacher-Zweymuller syndrome (277610), Harel et
al. (2005) identified homozygosity for a 3991C-T transition in exon 56
of the COL11A2 gene, resulting in an arg845-to-ter (R845X) substitution.
The R845X mutation was initially reported by Melkoniemi et al. (2000) in
compound heterozygous state in the offspring of nonconsanguineous
parents of northern European descent. The major differentiation between
WZS and otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia (OSMED; 215150) had been
proposed to be the 'catch-up growth' associated with the former, with a
definite diagnosis established also after follow-up. Given that
homozygous COL11A2 mutations causing OSMED have been identified
throughout the COL11A2 gene (Melkoniemi et al., 2000), it seems
improbable that one could define a specific region in the gene that,
when mutated, might cause WZS rather than OSMED. The R845X premature
translation termination mutation is in accordance with the mutations of
COL11A2 that are associated with OSMED, which are almost exclusively
frameshift or nonsense mutations that lead to the production of
truncated alpha-2 (XI) chains, unlikely to be incorporated into type XI
collagen molecules. Alternatively, these mutations may trigger
nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, and thus would be expected to be
functional nulls. Harel et al. (2005) concluded that autosomal recessive
WZS and OSMED are a single entity.

.0010
DEAFNESS, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 53
COL11A2, PRO621THR

In 5 affected members of 2 sibships of a consanguineous Iranian family
with nonsyndromic hearing loss (DFNB53; 609706), Chen et al. (2005)
identified homozygosity for an 1861C-A transversion in exon 21 of the
COL11A2 gene, resulting in a pro621-to-thr (P621T) substitution near the
N terminus of the triple helical region. The 4 parents and 1 sib were
heterozygous for the mutation.

.0011
OTOSPONDYLOMEGAEPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA
COL11A2, 1-BP DEL, 3962G

In an Egyptian brother and sister with OSMED (215150), Temtamy et al.
(2006) identified homozygosity for a 1-bp deletion (3962delG) in exon 55
of the COL11A2 gene, resulting in a termination codon in exon 56. The
first-cousin parents were heterozygous for the deletion; a younger
brother was unaffected.

FIBROCHONDROGENESIS 2
COL11A2, IVS18, 1-BP INS, +3

In a deceased infant with fibrochondrogenesis-2 (FBCG2; 614524), born of
consanguineous parents, Tompson et al. (2012) identified homozygosity
for a 1-bp insertion in intron 18 (+3insG) of the COL11A2 gene,
predicted to result in aberrant mRNA processing. The unaffected parents
were heterozygous for the mutation, as was an unaffected sib. An exon
trapping splicing assay in COS-7 cells demonstrated skipping of exon 18
in RNA from the mutant construct but not from the control.

.0013
FIBROCHONDROGENESIS 2
COL11A2, 9-BP DEL, NT2899

In a deceased infant with fibrochondrogenesis-2 (FBCG2; 614524), born of
healthy nonconsanguineous parents, Tompson et al. (2012) identified
heterozygosity for a de novo 9-bp deletion (2899_2907del9), predicted to
delete 3 amino acids within the triple helical domain. The mutation was
not present in the unaffected parents.

610063	TITLE *610063 DYNEIN, AXONEMAL, HEAVY CHAIN 17; DNAH17
;;DNEL2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Dyneins are microtubule-associated motor protein complexes composed of
several heavy, light, and intermediate chains. DNAH17 is a heavy chain
associated with axonemal dynein (Milisav and Affara, 1998).

CLONING

By screening an adult testis cDNA library using DNEL1 (DNAH9; 603330) as
probe, followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE, Milisav and Affara (1998)
obtained a partial cDNA for DNAH17, which they called DNEL2. Northern
blot analysis detected a 16-kb transcript in testis. RT-PCR showed
DNAH17 expression in adult testis, but not in any other adult or fetal
tissue examined, including fetal testis.

MAPPING

By FISH and radiation hybrid analysis, Milisav and Affara (1998) mapped
the DNAH17 gene to chromosome 17q25.

600050	TITLE *600050 MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE KINASE KINASE 11; MAP3K11
;;MIXED-LINEAGE PROTEIN KINASE 3; MLK3;;
PROTEIN-TYROSINE KINASE PTK1; PTK1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using RT-PCR and cDNA library screening, Ing et al. (1994) identified
MAP3K11, a novel protein kinase, from human thymus. The deduced open
reading frame, derived from sequencing a 3.5-kb MAP3K11 cDNA, encodes a
protein of 847 amino acids. Structural features include an SH3 domain in
the absence of an SH2 domain, a region containing 2 leucine zippers with
an adjacent C-terminal basic region, and a proline rich region. The
kinase showed homology with the mixed-lineage family of protein kinases
(MLKs) and shared the unusual leucine zipper-basic motif found in
previously identified MLK kinases; Ing et al. (1994) therefore called
the protein MLK3. By Northern blot analysis, MAP3K11 mRNA was detected
in a wide variety of normal and transformed human cell lines and
tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Using small interfering RNA (siRNA), Chadee and Kyriakis (2004) found
that MLK3 was required for both mitogen and cytokine activation of JNK
(see MAPK8; 601158), ERK (see MAPK3; 601795), and p38 (MAPK14; 600289)
in several human cell lines. Silencing MLK3 substantially blocked
serum-stimulated phosphorylation of RB1 (614041) in intestinal and lung
fibroblast cell lines, and it prevented serum-simulated proliferation of
tumor cells bearing oncogenic KRAS2 (190070) or loss-of-function NF1
(613113) or NF2 (607379) mutations. Proliferation of tumor cells bearing
activating RAF1 (164760) or BRAF (164757) mutations was unaffected by
MLK3 silencing. Chadee and Kyriakis (2004) also observed some cell
type-specific effects of MLK3 silencing, and murine Mlk3 siRNA, which
differs from the 21-bp human siRNA at 2 positions, did not silence MLK3
in human cells.

Consistent with the observation that MLK3 is required for BRAF
phosphorylation, Chadee et al. (2006) found that silencing MLK3 in human
embryonic kidney cells completely abrogated mitogen activation of BRAF,
but MLK3 kinase activity was not required for BRAF activation.
Coimmunoprecipitation experiments identified MLK3 as a component of the
BRAF/RAF1 complex, and MLK3 was required for integrity of the complex
and for activation of ERK by the complex. Mlk3 interacted with Nf2 in
rodent cells, and Nf2 disrupted protein-protein interactions within the
Braf/Raf1/Mlk3 complex. Chadee et al. (2006) concluded that MLK3 is a
signal-integrating kinase with conventional MAP3K catalytic activity and
additional noncatalytic functions that contribute to RAF/ERK signaling.

MAPPING

Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, Ing et al. (1994) mapped the
MAP3K11 gene to chromosome 11q13.1-q13.3. Courseaux et al. (1996) used a
combination of methods to refine maps of the approximately 5-Mb region
of 11q13 that includes MEN1 (131100). They proposed the following gene
order:
cen--PGA--FTH1--UGB--AHNAK--ROM1--MDU1--CHRM1--COX8--EMK1--FKBP2--PLCB3--[PYGM,
ZFM1]--FAU--CAPN1--[MAP3K11, RELA]--FOSL1--SEA--CFL1--tel.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Velho et al. (2010) screened 174 primary gastrointestinal cancers (48
hereditary and 126 sporadic forms) and 7 colorectal cancer cell lines
for MLK3 mutations. MLK3 mutations were significantly associated with
microsatellite instability (MSI) phenotype in primary tumors (p =
0.0005), occurring in 21% of the MSI carcinomas. Most MLK3 somatic
mutations identified were of the missense type (62.5%), and more than
80% of them affected evolutionarily conserved residues. A predictive 3D
model demonstrated that MLK3 missense mutations clustered in the kinase
domain but probably affected scaffold properties rather than kinase
activity. MLK3 missense mutations showed transforming capacity in vitro,
and cells expressing the mutant gene were able to develop locally
invasive tumors when subcutaneously injected in nude mice. In primary
tumors, MLK3 mutations occurred in KRAS and/or BRAF wildtype carcinomas,
although not being mutually exclusive genetic events.

600487	TITLE *600487 PROPROTEIN CONVERTASE, SUBTILISIN/KEXIN-TYPE, 4; PCSK4
;;PROPROTEIN CONVERTASE PC4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Proprotein convertases, including PCSK4, are calcium-dependent serine
proteases related to bacterial subtilisins and to yeast kexin. These
enzymes process precursor proteins to their active forms by selective
cleavage of the polypeptide at sites following paired basic amino acids.
In mammals, this family comprises PC1 (162150), PC2 (162151), PC4, PC5
(600488), furin (FUR; 136950), and PACE4 (167405). Substrates for these
enzymes range from prohormones to precursors for growth factors to cell
surface receptors and viral surface glycoproteins (Cao et al., 2001).

CLONING

By Western blot analysis of a human invasive extravillous trophoblast
cell line and placental tissue extracts, Qiu et al. (2005) found that
pro-PC4 and mature PC4 have apparent molecular masses of 72 and 54 kD,
respectively. In situ hybridization revealed that PC4 mRNA localized
predominantly in the cytotrophoblast layer during the first trimester
and in syncytiotrophoblasts, stroma cells, and to a lesser extent
cytotrophoblasts during the third trimester. Immunostaining detected PC4
in villous cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts in both first and
third trimester placental tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is a leading cause of perinatal
mortality. Qiu et al. (2005) found that aberrant processing of pro-IGF2
(147470) by PC4 may be a cause of IUGR. PC4 cleaved pro-IGF2 to generate
the intermediate processed form, IGF2 (1-102). Mature IGF2 (1-67),
likely resulting from further processing by carboxypeptidases (see CPE;
114855), is capable of activating invasive trophoblast cells through AKT
(see AKT1; 164730) phosphorylation. Inhibition of PC4 by a PC4-specific
inhibitor blocked pro-IGF2 processing and reduced trophoblast cell
migration. Serum samples of women carrying IUGR fetuses displayed
elevated levels of pro-IGF2 compared to normal pregnant women. Qiu et
al. (2005) suggested that abnormal processing of IGF2 by PC4 may be a
mechanism involved in the pathophysiology of fetoplacental growth
restriction.

MAPPING

Mbikay et al. (1995) mapped PC4, PC5, and PACE4 in the mouse by RFLP
analysis of a DNA panel from an interspecific backcross. The chromosomal
locations of the human homologs were determined by Southern blot
analysis of a DNA panel from human/rodent somatic cell hybrids, most of
which contained a single human chromosome. The gene for PC4 (Pcsk4
locus) was mapped to mouse chromosome 10, close to the adipsin locus
(Adn; see 134350) and near the gene encoding anti-mullerian hormone
(Amh; see 600957); in the human, the gene was localized to chromosome
19.

600424	TITLE *600424 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 19 (FOLATE TRANSPORTER), MEMBER 1; SLC19A1
;;FOLATE TRANSPORTER; FOLT;;
REDUCED FOLATE CARRIER 1; RFC1;;
INTESTINAL FOLATE CARRIER 1; IFC1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Transport of folate compounds into mammalian cells can occur via
receptor-mediated (see 136430) or carrier-mediated mechanisms. A
functional coordination between these 2 mechanisms has been proposed to
be the method of folate uptake in certain cell types. Methotrexate (MTX)
is an antifolate chemotherapeutic agent that is actively transported by
the carrier-mediated uptake system. RFC1 plays a role in maintaining
intracellular concentrations of folate.

CLONING

Several groups independently cloned cDNAs encoding the 591-amino acid
human folate transporter. Using a mouse reduced folate carrier (RFC)
partial cDNA as a probe, Wong et al. (1995) cloned a human RFC cDNA from
a library prepared from MTX transport-upregulated erythroleukemia cells.
Using homologous murine cDNAs as probes, Williams and Flintoff (1995),
Prasad et al. (1995), and Nguyen et al. (1997) independently isolated
human folate transporter cDNAs from lymphoblast, placenta, and small
intestine libraries, respectively.

Prasad et al. (1995) reported that the human folate transporter, which
they symbolized FOLT, had 65% amino acid sequence identity to mouse and
hamster folate transporters. When transfected into COS-1 and HeLa cells,
the human FOLT cDNA caused a significant increase in the uptake of
5-methyltetrahydrofolate. By Northern blot analysis, mRNA transcripts
hybridizing to the human FOLT cDNA were detected in placenta and liver
and also in several cell lines of human origin. The principal transcript
was approximately 2.7 kb.

Williams and Flintoff (1995) and Wong et al. (1995) observed that human
folate transport cDNAs expressed in MTX transport-deficient Chinese
hamster ovary cells restored MTX transport and sensitivity.

Nguyen et al. (1997) injected human intestinal folate carrier-1 (IFC1)
cRNA into Xenopus oocytes and observed increased uptake of
methyltetrahydrofolic acid. Northern blot analysis revealed that the
IFC1 gene was expressed as a 3.3-kb mRNA at a high level in placenta and
at lower levels in a variety of other tissues, including the small
intestine. In situ hybridization of thin sections of intestinal
epithelia demonstrated IFC1 expression localized to the villus and crypt
cells, particularly the upper half of the villi.

GENE FUNCTION

In luminal epithelial cells isolated from mouse small intestine, Chiao
et al. (1997) found increased PH-dependent folate influx associated with
RFC1 gene expression in the form of a 2.5-kb transcript and a 58-kD
brush border membrane protein detected by folate-based affinity labeling
and with antibodies against the transporter. The authors concluded that
RFC1 mediates intestinal folate transport.

GENE STRUCTURE

Point mutations in the reduced folate carrier-1 gene and alterations
resulting in the downregulation of its message are major factors in the
resistance to antifolate chemotherapeutic agents. As a framework for
understanding the significance of such changes in relation to gene
expression and function, Williams and Flintoff (1998) described the
organization of the RFC1 gene from human lymphoblasts. They found that
the gene contains 5 exons (2 to 6) coding for protein. At least 4
5-prime exons, used in a mutually exclusive manner in the production of
RFC1 message from lymphoblast cells, are spliced to exon 2, which
contains the translational start site. Semiquantitative PCR indicated
that exon 1 is preferentially used. The major transcriptional start site
was mapped by RACE and RNase protection to a region 109 to 135 bp
5-prime to the start of exon 1.

MAPPING

Yang-Feng et al. (1995) used the human folate transporter cDNA and a
human genomic clone hybridizing to the cDNA to perform chromosomal
mapping of the FOLT gene. Human/rodent somatic cell hybrid analysis
using the cDNA as the probe demonstrated perfect segregation with
chromosome 21. Isotopic in situ hybridization with the cDNA probe mapped
the gene to 21q22.3. Fluorescence in situ hybridization using the
genomic clone confirmed this chromosomal localization.

GENETIC VARIABILITY

Tolner et al. (1998) identified 3 splice variants of RFC1, incorporating
3 alternatives of exon 1 and 5 additional exons. By functional deletion
analysis, they identified 2 TATA-less promoters that show substantial
differences in the efficiency with which they drive transcription.
L1210/D3 mouse leukemia cells are resistant to
5,10-dideazatetrahydrofolate due to expansion of cellular folate pools
which block polyglutamation of the drug. These cells were found to have
2 point mutations in the RFC, resulting in the replacement of
isoleucine-48 by phenylalanine (I48F) and of tryptophan-105 by glycine
(W105G). Each mutation contributes to the resistance phenotype. Genomic
DNA from resistant cells contained both the wildtype and mutant alleles,
but wildtype message was not detected. Folic acid was a much better
substrate, and 5-formyltetrahydrofolate was a poorer substrate, for
transport in L1210/D3 cells relative to L1210 cells. Enhanced transport
of folic acid was due to a marked, approximately 20-fold, decrease in
the influx K(m). Influx of methotrexate and 5,10-dideazatetrahydrofolate
were minimally altered. Tse et al. (1998) concluded that the I48F and
W105G mutations in RFC caused resistance to
5,10-dideazatetrahydrofolate, that the region of the RFC protein near
these 2 positions defines the substrate-binding site, that the wildtype
allele was silenced during the multistep development of resistance, and
that this mutant phenotype represents a genetically dominant trait.

Using data from a California population-based case-control interview
study, Shaw et al. (2002) investigated whether spina bifida risk was
influenced by an interaction between a polymorphism of infant RFC1 at
nucleotide 80 (A80G) and maternal periconceptional use of vitamins
containing folic acid. Although the study did not find an increased
spina bifida risk for infants who were heterozygous or homozygous for
RFC1 A80G, it did reveal modest evidence for a gene-nutrient interaction
between infant homozygosity for the G80/G80 genotype and maternal
periconceptional intake of vitamins containing folic acid on the risk of
spina bifida.

;;KALLIKREIN 6;;
PROTEASE, SERINE, 9; PRSS9;;
PROTEASE M;;
ZYME;;
NEUROSIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Anisowicz et al. (1996) used differential display PCR to identify a
novel gene that was expressed in a primary breast cancer cell line, but
not in the corresponding metastatic cell lines from the same patient.
They cloned the full-length cDNA, which encoded a postulated protein of
244 amino acids that they termed 'protease M.' The protein sequence
contained a serine protease domain and had high homology to the
kallikreins (KLK1; 147910 and KLK2; 147960), trypsin-1 (PRSS1; 276000),
and prostate-specific antigen (PSA; 176820). Northern blot analysis
revealed that the PRSS9 mRNA was expressed in several primary tumors and
cell lines from mammary, prostate, and ovarian cancers, but was not
detected in any metastases of these cancers. Among normal tissues, a
1.7-kb message was detected in brain and kidney and a 1.2-kb message was
detected in pancreas.

Little et al. (1997) cloned the PRSS9 cDNA, which they termed 'zyme,'
using PCR of Alzheimer disease brain tissue. When zyme cDNA was
coexpressed with the Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein (APP; 104760),
amyloidogenic fragments were detected. Southern blot analysis failed to
show definitive PRSS9 homologs in several other mammalian species,
suggesting that zyme may have species specificity. Yamashiro et al.
(1997) cloned a cDNA encoding PRSS9, which they called 'neurosin,' from
a cDNA library prepared from a colon adenocarcinoma cell line.

Using RT-PCR, Gan et al. (2000) detected KLK6 expression in most of the
35 adult and fetal tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Accumulation of insoluble alpha-synuclein (163890) aggregates in the
brain is characteristic of Parkinson disease (PD; 168600), dementia with
Lewy bodies (DLB; 127750), and multiple system atrophy. Iwata et al.
(2003) found that the serine protease neurosin (kallikrein-6) degraded
alpha-synuclein and colocalized with pathologic inclusions such as Lewy
bodies and glial cytoplasmic inclusions. In cell lysates, neurosin
prevented alpha-synuclein polymerization by reducing the amount of
monomer and also by generating fragmented alpha-synucleins that
themselves inhibited the polymerization. Upon cellular stress, neurosin
was released from mitochondria to the cytosol, which resulted in the
increase of degraded alpha-synuclein species. Downregulation of neurosin
caused accumulation of alpha-synuclein within cultured cells. The
authors concluded that neurosin may play a significant role in
physiologic alpha-synuclein degradation and also in the pathogenesis of
synucleinopathies.

GENE STRUCTURE

Elliott et al. (2006) determined that the KLK6 gene contains 7 exons,
the first 2 of which are noncoding.

MAPPING

Anisowicz et al. (1996) used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
to localize the PRSS9 gene to human chromosome 19q13.3 and noted that
the kallikreins and PSA are also localized to that region. Little et al.
(1997) determined the same localization using cell hybrid panels and
FISH. They pointed out that this region shows genetic linkage with late
onset familial Alzheimer's disease (AD2; 104310).

By genomic sequence analysis, Gan et al. (2000) localized the KLK6 gene
within the KLK gene cluster on chromosome 19q13. This cluster includes
13 KLK genes and 5 pseudogenes.

612611	TITLE *612611 LATE CORNIFIED ENVELOPE PROTEIN 2C; LCE2C
;;LATE ENVELOPE PROTEIN 11; LEP11
DESCRIPTION For background information on the LCE gene cluster, see 612603.

CLONING

By database analysis to identify human orthologs of mouse genes encoding
late envelope proteins (LEPs), Marshall et al. (2001) identified LCE2C,
which they called LEP11. RT-PCR detected high LEP11 expression in skin
and esophagus, but not in heart.

Using real-time PCR, Jackson et al. (2005) detected low LCE2C expression
in human fetal, arm, penal, and abdominal skin, and little to no
expression in vulva, tongue, and esophagus.

GENE FUNCTION

Jackson et al. (2005) showed that expression of LCE2 genes, including
LCE2C, was upregulated in cultured normal human keratinocytes by both
ultraviolet irradiation and calcium.

GENE STRUCTURE

Jackson et al. (2005) determined that the LCE2C gene contains 2 exons.
Exon 1 is noncoding.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Marshall et al. (2001) mapped the LCE2C
gene within the LCE gene cluster on chromosome 1q21. Jackson et al.
(2005) stated that the mouse Lce2c gene maps to a syntenic LCE gene
cluster on chromosome 3F1.

182350	TITLE *182350 ATPase, Na+/K+ TRANSPORTING, ALPHA-3 POLYPEPTIDE; ATP1A3
;;SODIUM-POTASSIUM-ATPase, ALPHA-3 POLYPEPTIDE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The alpha subunit of the Na,K-ATPase is the catalytic subunit. Three
isoforms are expressed in the nervous system: ATP1A1 (182310), ATP1A2
(182340), and ATP1A3 (de Carvalho Aguiar et al., 2004).

GENE FUNCTION

Agrin (AGRN; 103320) mediates accumulation of acetylcholine receptors at
the developing neuromuscular junction through its interaction with MUSK
(601296), and it has also been implicated in brain development. Through
biochemical studies, Hilgenberg et al. (2006) found that agrin bound
Atp1a3 in mouse cortical neurons. Immunohistochemical analysis showed
that Atp1a3 colocalized with agrin-binding sites at synapses. Agrin
inhibited Atp1a3 activity, resulting in membrane depolarization and
increased action potential frequency in mouse cortical neurons in
culture and acute slice. An agrin fragment that acted as a competitive
antagonist depressed action potential frequency, indicating that
endogenous agrin regulates native Atp1a3 function. Hilgenberg et al.
(2006) concluded that agrin regulates activity-dependent processes in
neurons through its interaction with ATP1A3.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ovchinnikov et al. (1988) determined that the ATP1A3 gene has about
25,000 basepairs and that its protein-coding region includes 23 exons.

MAPPING

By Southern analysis of DNA from panels of rodent/human somatic cell
hybrid lines, Yang-Feng et al. (1988) mapped the ATP1A3 gene to
chromosome 19q12-q13.2. Harley et al. (1988) concluded that the order is
qter--DM--APOC2--ATP1A3--cen.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Dystonia 12

In 7 unrelated families with rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism, or
dystonia-12 (DYT12; 128235), de Carvalho Aguiar et al. (2004) identified
6 different heterozygous mutations in the ATP1A3 gene
(182350.0001-182350.0006). Functional expression studies and structural
analysis suggested that the mutations impaired enzyme activity or
stability.

Anselm et al. (2009) and Blanco-Arias et al. (2009) reported de novo
heterozygous ATP1A3 mutations (182350.0007 and 182350.0008,
respectively) in patients with DYT12.

- Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood 2

In 82 of 105 patients with alternating hemiplegia of childhood-2 (AHC2;
615820), Heinzen et al. (2012) identified 19 different heterozygous
mutations in the ATP1A3 gene (see, e.g., 182350.0009-182350.0012). The
first mutations were identified through exome sequencing of affected
individuals. Thirteen of the 18 mutations observed in sporadic cases
were confirmed to occur de novo. Since it was possible that some
variants represented polymorphisms, Heinzen et al. (2012) estimated that
mutations in the ATP1A3 gene may be responsible for up to 74% of
patients with sporadic, typical AHC. Several mutations were recurrent,
and some occurred within hypermutable sequences. All patients had
infantile onset of hemiplegia attacks, usually associated with episodes
of quadriparesis, abnormal eye movements, autonomic signs, seizures,
dystonia, ataxia, chorea, and developmental delay. Transfection of
several of the mutations in HeLa cells showed protein levels similar to
wildtype, but ATP1A3 activity was significantly decreased. In contrast,
transfection of DYT12-associated mutations resulted in decreased protein
levels as well as decreased activity. The report expanded the spectrum
of phenotypes associated with mutations in the ATP1A3 gene.

ANIMAL MODEL

Ashmore et al. (2009) identified 6 different EMS-induced missense
mutations in the Atp1a2 and Atp1a3 genes in Drosophila. All mutations
resulted in reduced respiration activity consistent with a loss of
ATPase function and a hypomorphic effect. Different mutant strains
exhibited some abnormalities, including progressive
temperature-dependent paralysis, progressive stress-sensitive paralysis,
and decreased locomotor activity in response to startle, suggesting a
decrease in maximal locomotion capacity. Neuromuscular studies showed
allele-specific pathology, including brain vacuoles and myopathology,
and biochemical studies showed decreased metabolic rates. An unexpected
finding was the some mutant strains had increased longevity, which was
not related to caloric restriction. Low doses of ouabain showed a
similar effect on longevity in control groups. Ashmore et al. (2009)
suggested that these findings may be relevant for studying the
pathogenesis of FHM2 and DYT12 (128235).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
DYSTONIA 12
ATP1A3, THR613MET

In a sporadic patient (Linazasoro et al., 2002) and affected members of
a second family (Zaremba et al., 2004) with dystonia-12 (DYT12; 128235),
de Carvalho Aguiar et al. (2004) identified a heterozygous 1838C-T
transition in the ATP1A3 gene, resulting in a thr613-to-met (T613M)
substitution in a highly conserved residue near the phosphorylation
domain on the cytoplasmic face of the protein. The mutation was not
identified in 500 northern European control chromosomes.

Brashear et al. (2007) identified the T613M mutation in a family with
DYT12 reported by Pittock et al. (2000).

.0002
DYSTONIA 12
ATP1A3, ILE274THR

In a patient with dystonia-12 (128235), de Carvalho Aguiar et al. (2004)
identified a heterozygous 821T-C transition in the ATP1A3 gene,
resulting in an ile274-to-thr (I274T) substitution in a highly conserved
residue in the transmembrane domain of the protein. The mutation was not
identified in 500 northern European control chromosomes. The patient had
disease onset at age 37 years.

.0003
DYSTONIA 12
ATP1A3, GLU277LYS

In a patient with dystonia-12 (128235), de Carvalho Aguiar et al. (2004)
identified a heterozygous 829G-A transition in exon 8 of the ATP1A3
gene, resulting in a glu277-to-lys (E277K) substitution in a highly
conserved residue in the transmembrane domain of the protein. The
mutation was not identified in 500 northern European control
chromosomes. The patient had disease onset at age 20 years.

Tarsy et al. (2010) identified the E277K mutation in a 29-year-old woman
of African Caribbean descent with DYT12. She had onset at age 26 years
of weakness and flexion of the left hand and ankle, which progressed
rapidly over the next few years to become frank dystonia of the left arm
and bulbar symptoms, including dysphagia, laryngeal dysfunction with
task-specific dysphonia, and oropharyngeal dysmotility. She also had
mild parkinsonism, with hypomimia and wide-based gait. Treatment with
oral trihexyphenidyl and botulinum injection into selected laryngeal
muscles resulted in clinical improvement.

.0004
DYSTONIA 12
ATP1A3, ILE758SER

In 12 affected members of a family with dystonia-12 (128235) reported by
Dobyns et al. (1993), de Carvalho Aguiar et al. (2004) identified a
heterozygous 2273T-G transversion in the ATP1A3 gene, resulting in an
ile758-to-ser (I758S) substitution in a highly conserved residue in the
transmembrane domain of the protein. The mutation was not identified in
500 northern European control chromosomes.

.0005
DYSTONIA 12
ATP1A3, PHE780LEU

In 2 affected members of a family with dystonia-12 (128235), de Carvalho
Aguiar et al. (2004) identified a heterozygous 2338T-C transition in the
ATP1A3 gene, resulting in a phe780-to-leu (F780L) substitution in a
highly conserved residue in the transmembrane region of the protein
close to the extracellular surface. The mutation was not identified in
500 northern European control chromosomes.

.0006
DYSTONIA 12
ATP1A3, ASP801TYR

In 4 affected members of a family with dystonia-12 (128235) reported by
Brashear et al. (1997), de Carvalho Aguiar et al. (2004) identified a
heterozygous 2401G-T transversion in the ATP1A3 gene, resulting in an
asp801-to-tyr (D801Y) substitution in a highly conserved residue in the
transmembrane region of the protein. The mutation was not identified in
500 northern European control chromosomes.

.0007
DYSTONIA 12
ATP1A3, ASP923ASN

In a boy with early-onset DYT12 (128235) at age 4 years, Anselm et al.
(2009) identified a heterozygous de novo 2767G-A transition in exon 20
of the ATP1A3 gene, resulting in an asp923-to-asn (D923N) substitution.
The mutation was not found in 338 Caucasian control chromosomes. The
substitution was predicted to occur in a residue buried in the membrane
close to the ion-binding residue gln920, suggesting that it may affect
enzyme activity. He was born of an unaffected Caucasian father and
Chinese mother. The onset of dystonia was abrupt, occurring after mild
trauma to the forehead. He developed mutism, eye convergence, and
inability to walk, which later evolved into severe dystonia, severe
dysarthria, and drooling. The condition stabilized over several months,
and he showed mild improvement over the next 8 years. About a year after
onset, he developed unusual episodes of flaccidity lasting for hours,
later replaced by shorter episodes of stiffness. Treatment with L-dopa
was not effective. At the time of the report, he had bulbar symptoms,
striking oromotor dystonia with inability to speak or swallow well, and
apraxia.

.0008
DYSTONIA 12
ATP1A3, 3-BP DUP, 3191TAC

In a 16-year-old female with DYT12 (128235), Blanco-Arias et al. (2009)
reported a de novo heterozygous 3-bp duplication (3191dupTAC) in exon 23
of the ATP1A3 gene, resulting in duplication of tyr1013, the C-terminal
amino acid of the protein before the stop codon. The mutation was not
found in either parent, her brother, or in 218 control individuals. HeLa
cells expressing the mutant protein showed decreased survival in
response to ouabain challenge, but no defect was detected in protein
expression or plasma membrane targeting. Functional analysis
demonstrated a drastic 40- to 50-fold reduction in Na(+) affinity in the
mutant. Blanco-Arias et al. (2009) suggested a crucial role for the C
terminus of the alpha-subunit in the function of the Na+/K+-ATPase and
emphasized a key impact of Na(+) affinity in the pathophysiology of
DYT12.

.0009
ALTERNATING HEMIPLEGIA OF CHILDHOOD 2
ATP1A3, ASP801ASN

In 36 of 95 unrelated patients with alternating hemiplegia of childhood
(614820), Heinzen et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous 2401G-A
transition in the ATP1A3 gene, resulting in an asp801-to-asn (D801N)
substitution in the sixth transmembrane domain. The mutation was
demonstrated to occur de novo in cases where parental material was
available. All patients had infantile onset of hemiplegia attacks,
usually associated with episodes of quadriparesis, abnormal eye
movements, autonomic signs, seizures, dystonia, ataxia, chorea, and
developmental delay. Transfection of the mutation in HeLa cells showed
protein levels similar to wildtype, but ATP1A3 activity was
significantly decreased. Evaluation of the crystal structure of the
protein predicted that the D801N substitution would prevent the binding
of potassium ions to the pump.

.0010
ALTERNATING HEMIPLEGIA OF CHILDHOOD 2
ATP1A3, GLU815LYS

In 19 patients with alternating hemiplegia of childhood-2 (614820),
Heinzen et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous 2443G-A transition in
the ATP1A3 gene, resulting in a glu815-to-lys (E815K) substitution in
the sixth transmembrane domain. The mutation was shown to occur de novo
in all patients whose parents were available for study. Transfection of
the mutation in HeLa cells showed protein levels similar to wildtype,
but ATP1A3 activity was significantly decreased.

.0011
ALTERNATING HEMIPLEGIA OF CHILDHOOD 2
ATP1A3, SER811PRO

In 4 unrelated patients with AHC2 (614820), Heinzen et al. (2012)
identified a de novo heterozygous 2431T-C transition in the ATP1A3 gene,
resulting in a ser811-to-pro (S811P) substitution in the sixth
transmembrane domain. Transfection of the mutation in HeLa cells showed
protein levels similar to wildtype, but ATP1A3 activity was
significantly decreased.

.0012
ALTERNATING HEMIPLEGIA OF CHILDHOOD 2
ATP1A3, GLY947ARG

In 5 patients with AHC2 (614820), Heinzen et al. (2012) identified a
heterozygous 2839G-A transition in the ATP1A3 gene, resulting in a
gly947-to-arg (G947R) substitution in the ninth transmembrane domain.
The mutation was shown to occur de novo in all patients whose parents
were available for study.

604581	TITLE *604581 ATPase FAMILY GENE 3-LIKE 2; AFG3L2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

AFG3L2 is the catalytic subunit of the m-AAA protease, an ATP-dependent
proteolytic complex of the mitochondrial inner membrane that degrades
misfolded proteins and regulates ribosome assembly (summary by Koppen et
al., 2007).

CLONING

By searching an EST database with the sequence of paraplegin (SPG7;
602783) and screening a fetal brain cDNA library, Banfi et al. (1999)
identified a cDNA for AFG3L2. AFG3L2 encodes a deduced 797-amino acid
protein whose sequence shows 69% similarity to the yeast Afg3
mitochondrial ATPase and 49% identity to paraplegin. AFG3L2 contains an
AAA (for ATPase associated with diverse cellular activities) domain of
about 190 amino acids with an ATP/GTP-binding site, a zinc-dependent
binding domain, and an RNA-binding region. Northern blot analysis
revealed that AFG3L2 is expressed ubiquitously as a 3.2-kb transcript in
fetal and adult tissues, with greatest expression in heart and skeletal
muscle. Fluorescence microscopy showed that AFG3L2 is localized in
mitochondria. Thus, AFG3L2 and paraplegin share a similar expression
pattern and the same localization.

GENE STRUCTURE

Di Bella et al. (2010) noted that the AFG3L2 gene contains 17 exons
spanning 48 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Banfi et al. (1999) mapped the AFG3L2 gene
to chromosome 18p11. Di Bella et al. (2010) noted that the AFG3L2 gene
maps to chromosome 18p11.21.

GENE FUNCTION

Using in vitro protein binding assays and immunoprecipitation analysis,
Koppen et al. (2007) showed that paraplegin interacted with AFG3L2 in
the m-AAA protease complex. AFG3L2 also interacted with itself. Loss of
paraplegin in Spg7 -/- mice or in SPG7 patient fibroblasts resulted in
m-AAA protease complexes made up of only homodimerized AFG7L2 that were
proteolytically active against misfolded mitochondrial membrane proteins
in yeast complementation assays.

Di Bella et al. (2010) found expression of the AFG3L2 gene in Purkinje
cell bodies and dendrites of the human cerebellum and in large neurons
of the deep cerebellar layer. AFG3L2 and paraplegin were also expressed
in pyramidal cortical neurons and spinal motor neurons. Similar
expression was found in mouse tissues.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Spinocerebellar Ataxia 28

In affected members of 5 unrelated families with autosomal dominant
spinocerebellar ataxia-28 (SCA28; 610246), Di Bella et al. (2010)
identified 5 different heterozygous mutations in the AFG3L2 gene
(604581.0001-604581.0005). Studies in yeast showed that the mutations
affected respiratory and proteolytic functions of the protein by both
dominant-negative (E691K; 604581.0001), and loss-of-function (see, e.g.,
S674L, 604581.0002) mechanisms. Di Bella et al. (2010) hypothesized that
AFG3L2 or specific substrates of AFG3L2 may have an essential function
in protecting the cerebellum from neurodegeneration.

Cagnoli et al. (2010) identified 6 different missense mutations in exons
15 and 16 of the AFG3L2 gene (see, e.g., 604581.0006-604581.0009) in 9
(2.6%) of 366 Caucasian European probands with autosomal dominant SCA
who were negative for the most common triplet expansions in other genes.
All mutations affected the highly conserved C-terminal peptidase-M41
domain and were predicted to destabilize the AFG3L2 complex. Pathogenic
copy number variations affecting the AFG3L2 gene were not detected.

- Spastic Ataxia 5

By whole-exome sequencing of 2 brothers with early-onset spastic
ataxia-5 (SPAX5; 614487), Pierson et al. (2011) identified a homozygous
mutation in the AFG3L2 gene (Y616C; 604581.0010). The phenotype was
characterized by early-onset spasticity resulting in significantly
impaired ambulation, cerebellar ataxia, oculomotor apraxia, dystonia,
and myoclonic epilepsy. In vitro functional expression studies in yeast
showed that Y616C was a hypomorphic allele, resulting in decreased
activity of the homooligomeric enzyme, but not in complete inhibition.
The Y616C mutant protein also showed impaired ability to assemble with
itself or with paraplegin in protease complexes, resulting in low levels
of functionally active protease complexes and a functional paraplegin
defect. The report expanded the phenotype associated with AFG3L2
mutations and was reminiscent of a combined SCA28/SPG7 (607259)
phenotype with some features of a mitochondrial disorder.

ANIMAL MODEL

Martinelli et al. (2009) reported an early-onset severe neurologic
phenotype in Spg7-null/Afg3l2 +/- double-mutant mice characterized by
loss of balance, tremor, and ataxia. Double-mutant mice displayed
acceleration and worsening of the axonopathy observed in Spg7-null mice.
In addition, they showed prominent cerebellar degeneration with loss of
Purkinje cells and parallel fibers, and reactive astrogliosis.
Mitochondria from affected tissues were prone to lose mtDNA and had
unstable respiratory complexes. At late stages, neurons contained
structural abnormal mitochondria defective in COX-SDH reaction.
Martinelli et al. (2009) suggested that different neuronal populations
may have variable thresholds of susceptibility to reduced levels of the
m-AAA protease and that impaired mitochondrial proteolysis may be a
mechanism of cerebellar degeneration.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA 28
AFG3L2, GLU691LYS

In 11 affected members of an Italian family with autosomal dominant
spinocerebellar ataxia-28 (SCA28; 610246), reported by Cagnoli et al.
(2006), Di Bella et al. (2010) identified a heterozygous 2071G-A
transition in exon 16 of the AFG3L2 gene, resulting in a glu691-to-lys
(E691K) substitution within the highly conserved proteolytic domain. One
asymptomatic individual carried the mutation, which was not found in 400
controls. Molecular modeling showed that the E691K substitution affects
a residue that sits in the middle of the central pore surrounding the
exit from the proteolytic chamber on the matrix side of the complex. In
vitro studies in yeast showed that the mutant protein was expressed but
unable to restore an endogenous respiration defect. Coexpression with
wildtype AFG3L2 or paraplegin (602783) did not restore respiration,
consistent with a dominant-negative effect. Further studies showed that
the mutant protein had impaired proteolytic activity.

.0002
SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA 28
AFG3L2, 2-BP DEL/2-BP INS, NT2021

In a father and son with SCA28 (610246), Di Bella et al. (2010)
identified a heterozygous 2-bp deletion/2-bp insertion (2021delCCinsTA)
in exon 16 of the AFG3L2 gene, resulting in a ser674-to-leu (S674L)
substitution in a portion of the proteolytic domain. In vitro studies in
yeast showed that the mutant protein was expressed but unable to restore
an endogenous respiration defect. The mechanism appeared to be loss of
function and haploinsufficiency, since coexpression with either wildtype
AFG3L2 or paraplegin (602783) restored respiration. Further studies
showed that the mutant protein had impaired proteolytic activity.

.0003
SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA 28
AFG3L2, ALA694GLU

In a man with SCA28 (610246), Di Bella et al. (2010) identified a
heterozygous 2081C-A transversion in exon 16 of the AFG3L2 gene,
resulting in an ala694-to-glu (A694E) substitution in a portion of the
proteolytic domain. His deceased father was also affected. In vitro
studies in yeast showed that the mutant protein was expressed but unable
to restore an endogenous respiration defect. The mechanism appeared to
be loss of function and haploinsufficiency, since coexpression with
either wildtype AFG3L2 or paraplegin (602783) restored respiration.
Further studies showed that the mutant protein had impaired proteolytic
activity.

.0004
SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA 28
AFG3L2, ARG702GLN

In a 40-year-old woman with SCA28 (610246), Di Bella et al. (2010)
identified a heterozygous 2105G-A transition in exon 16 of the AFG3L2
gene, resulting in an arg702-to-gln (R702Q) substitution in a portion of
the proteolytic domain. The patient had onset at age 28 years of
progressive gait and limb ataxia, with later development of dysarthria,
ophthalmoplegia, and pyramidal signs. Brain MRI showed marked cerebellar
atrophy. Two clinically unaffected family members in their seventies
also carried the mutation; they both reported a subjective sense of
unsteadiness and showed moderate cerebellar atrophy on brain MRI. In
vitro studies in yeast showed that the mutant protein was expressed but
unable to restore an endogenous respiration defect. The mechanism
appeared to be loss of function and haploinsufficiency, since
coexpression with either wildtype AFG3L2 or paraplegin (602783) restored
respiration. Further studies showed that the mutant protein had impaired
proteolytic activity.

.0005
SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA 28
AFG3L2, ASN432THR

In 6 affected members of a family with SCA28 (610246), Di Bella et al.
(2010) identified a heterozygous 1296A-C transversion in exon 10 of the
AFG3L2 gene, resulting in an asn432-to-thr (N432T) substitution within a
highly conserved region of the ATPase domain. Molecular modeling showed
that the N432T substitution occurs in a conserved residue in the central
pore region on the membrane side of the channel through which substrates
are translocated into the proteolytic chamber. In vitro studies in yeast
showed that the mutant protein was expressed but unable to restore an
endogenous respiration defect at high temperatures. Coexpression with
wildtype AFG3L2 or paraplegin (602783) did not restore respiration,
consistent with a dominant-negative effect. Further studies showed that
the mutant protein had impaired proteolytic activity.

.0006
SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA 28
AFG3L2, MET666VAL

In affected members of 2 unrelated families with autosomal dominant
SCA28 (610246), Cagnoli et al. (2010) identified a heterozygous 1996A-G
transition in exon 16 of the AFG3L2 gene, resulting in a met666-to-val
(M666V) substitution in a highly conserved residue in the C-terminal
proteolytic peptidase-M41 domain. Haplotype analysis indicated a founder
effect. The mutation was not identified in 380 French or Italian control
chromosomes.

.0007
SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA 28
AFG3L2, MET666ARG

In 2 affected members a family with autosomal dominant SCA28 (610246),
Cagnoli et al. (2010) identified a heterozygous 1997T-G transversion in
exon 16 of the AFG3L2 gene, resulting in a met666-to-arg (M666R)
substitution in a highly conserved residue in the C-terminal proteolytic
peptidase-M41 domain. Met666 is located on the surface of the AFG3L2
complex, and the mutation was predicted to decrease the electrostatic
potential difference between the inner mitochondrial membrane side and
the matrix side of the hexameric complex, as well as decrease the
central pore dipole. These findings suggested a destabilizing effect.
The mutation was not identified in 380 French or Italian control
chromosomes.

.0008
SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA 28
AFG3L2, GLY671ARG

In affected members of 2 unrelated families with autosomal dominant
SCA28 (610246), Cagnoli et al. (2010) identified a heterozygous 2011G-A
transition in exon 16 of the AFG3L2 gene, resulting in a gly671-to-arg
(G671R) substitution in a highly conserved residue in the C-terminal
proteolytic peptidase-M41 domain. Haplotype analysis indicated a founder
effect. Gly671 is located on the surface of the AFG3L2 complex, and the
mutation was predicted to decrease the electrostatic potential
difference between the inner mitochondrial membrane side and the matrix
side of the hexameric complex, as well as decrease the central pore
dipole. These findings suggested a destabilizing effect. The mutation
was not identified in 380 French or Italian control chromosomes.

.0009
SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA 28
AFG3L2, THR654ILE

In affected members of 2 unrelated families with autosomal dominant
SCA28 (610246), Cagnoli et al. (2010) identified a heterozygous 1961C-T
transition in exon 15 of the AFG3L2 gene, resulting in a thr654-to-ile
(T654I) substitution in a highly conserved residue in the C-terminal
proteolytic peptidase-M41 domain. Haplotype analysis indicated a founder
effect. The mutation was not identified in 380 French or Italian control
chromosomes.

.0010
SPASTIC ATAXIA 5, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
AFG3L2, TYR616CYS

In 2 brothers, born of consanguineous Hispanic parents from Colombia,
with autosomal recessive spastic ataxia-5 (SPAX5; 614487), Pierson et
al. (2011) identified a homozygous 1847G-A transition in the AFG3L2
gene, resulting in a tyr616-to-cys (Y616C) substitution in a highly
conserved residue at the beginning of the proteolytic domain. The
mutation was found by whole-exome sequencing. The older patient
developed spastic gait at age 2 years and eventually lost the ability to
ambulate independently, whereas the younger brother never acquired
independent ambulation and died at age 13 years of pneumonia. Both
developed progressive myoclonic epilepsy associated with generalized
tonic-clonic seizures at age 8 years. This was followed by progressive
dysarthria, dysphagia, motor degeneration, and lower extremity weakness
with distal muscle atrophy. The older brother showed dysmetria,
dysdiadochokinesia, ataxic dysarthria, ptosis, oculomotor apraxia, and
dystonic movements. Cognition was normal. Brain MRI showed moderate
cerebellar atrophy, and nerve conduction studies showed an axonal
sensorimotor neuropathy of the lower extremities. Electron microscopy of
skeletal muscle showed misplaced mitochondria associated with large
lipid droplets, and there was decreased mtDNA copy number. Both parents
were without neurologic complaints and had normal neurologic and
ophthalmologic exams, although the mother had mild cerebellar atrophy on
brain imaging. In vitro functional expression studies in yeast showed
that Y616C was a hypomorphic allele, resulting in decreased activity of
the homooligomeric enzyme, but not in complete inhibition. The Y616C
mutant protein also showed impaired ability to assemble with itself or
with paraplegin (SPG7; 602783) in protease complexes, resulting in low
levels of functionally active protease complexes and a functional
paraplegin defect. The report expanded the phenotype associated with
AFG3L2 mutations and was reminiscent of a combined SCA28/SPG7 (607259)
phenotype with some features of a mitochondrial disorder.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

HIF is a transcriptional complex that plays a central role in mammalian
oxygen homeostasis. Posttranslational modification by prolyl
hydroxylation is a key regulatory event that targets HIF-alpha (HIF1;
603348) subunits for proteasomal destruction via the von Hippel-Lindau
(VHL; 608537) ubiquitylation complex. Epstein et al. (2001) defined a
conserved HIF-VHL-prolyl hydroxylase pathway in C. elegans and
identified Egl9 as a dioxygenase that regulates HIF by prolyl
hydroxylation. In mammalian cells, they showed that the HIF-prolyl
hydroxylases are represented by 3 proteins with a conserved
2-histidine-1-carboxylate iron coordination motif at the catalytic site.
The genes encoding these proteins were cloned and termed PHD1, PHD2
(606425), and PHD3 (606426) by the authors. Direct modulation of
recombinant enzyme activity by graded hypoxia, iron chelation, and
cobaltous ions mirrored the characteristics of HIF induction in vivo,
fulfilling requirements for these enzymes being oxygen sensors that
regulate HIF.

Bruick and McKnight (2001) independently identified the conserved family
of HIF prolyl hydroxylase enzymes, which they called HPH1, 2, and 3,
respectively, that appear to be responsible for the posttranslational
modification of HIF that targets it for ubiquitination.

By quantitative RT-PCR, Oehme et al. (2002) found highest EGLN2
expression in testis, with much lower expression in the 16 other human
tissues examined.

Independently, Hirsila et al. (2003) cloned HIFP4H1, HIFP4H2, and
HIFP4HD3 by PCR of human colon, aorta, and lung cDNA. The deduced
407-amino acid HIFP4H1 protein contains a C-terminal catalytic domain
with motifs for binding iron and the C5 carboxyl group of
2-oxoglutarate. PCR analysis of adult and fetal samples revealed HIFP4H1
expression in all tissues examined, with highest expression in adult
brain, placenta, lung, and kidney.

GENE FUNCTION

In cultured mammalian cells, Bruick and McKnight (2001) found that the
inappropriate accumulation of HIF caused by forced expression of the
HIF1-alpha subunit under normoxic conditions was attenuated by
coexpression of HPH. Suppression of HPH in cultured Drosophila
melanogaster cells by RNA interference resulted in elevated expression
of the hypoxia-inducible gene LDH (see 150000) under normoxic
conditions. Bruick and McKnight (2001) concluded that HPH is an
essential component of the pathway through which cells sense oxygen.

Using recombinant proteins expressed in insect cells, Hirsila et al.
(2003) found that HIFP4H1, HIFP4H2, and HIFP4H3 showed in vitro
2-oxoglutarate-dependent hydroxylation of a 19-residue peptide
corresponding to the C-terminal prolyl hydroxylation site of HIF1-alpha.
All 3 enzymes showed lower or no activity against a peptide
corresponding to a more N-terminal putative prolyl hydroxylation site in
HIF1-alpha. All 3 enzymes hydroxylated peptides designed from putative
prolyl hydroxylation sites of human HIF2-alpha (EPAS1; 603349),
HIF3-alpha (HIF3A; 609976), and C. elegans HIF-alpha.

Nakayama et al. (2004) demonstrated that PHD1 and PHD3 abundance is
regulated via their targeting for proteasome-dependent degradation by
the E3 ubiquitin ligases SIAH1 (602212) and SIAH2 (602213) under hypoxia
conditions. Siah2-null mouse fibroblasts exhibited prolonged Phd3
half-life, resulting in lower levels of Hif1a expression during hypoxia.
Hypoxia-induced Hif1a expression was completely inhibited in
Siah1a/Siah2-null cells, yet could be rescued upon inhibition of Phd3 by
RNA interference. In 293T cells, SIAH2 targeting of PHD3 for degradation
increased upon exposure to even mild hypoxic conditions, which coincided
with increased SIAH2 transcription. Siah2-null mice subjected to hypoxia
displayed an impaired hyperpneic respiratory response and reduced levels
of hemoglobin. Nakayama et al. (2004) concluded that control of PHD1 and
PHD3 by SIAH1 and SIAH2 constitutes another level of complexity in the
regulation of HIF1A during hypoxia.

Minamishima and Kaelin (2010) showed that loss of all 3 PHDs (PHD1;
PHD2, 606425; and PHD3, 606426) in the liver dramatically increased EPO
(133170) and hematocrit values to concentrations vastly in excess of
those achieved after renal PHD2 inactivation. Minamishima and Kaelin
(2010) found that PHD2 inactivation is sufficient to induce near maximal
renal EPO production, whereas inactivation of all 3 PHDs is needed to
reactivate hepatic EPO production.

ANIMAL MODEL

HIF prolyl hydroxylases are oxygen sensors that regulate the stability
of the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) in an oxygen-dependent manner.
Aragones et al. (2008) showed that loss of Phd1 expression in knockout
mice lowers oxygen consumption in skeletal muscle by reprogramming
glucose metabolism from oxidative to more anaerobic ATP production
through activation of a PPAR-alpha (170998) pathway. This metabolic
adaptation to oxygen conservation impairs oxidative muscle performance
in healthy conditions, but it provides acute protection of myofibers
against lethal ischemia. Hypoxia tolerance is due to reduced generation
of oxidative stress, which allows Phd1-deficient myofibers to preserve
mitochondrial respiration. Of medical importance, conditional knockdown
of Phd1 also rapidly induces hypoxia tolerance. These findings delineate
a new role of Phd1 in hypoxia tolerance and offer new treatment
perspectives for disorders characterized by oxidative stress.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the EGLN2 gene to chromosome 19q13.2 based on an
alignment of the EGLN2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AJ310544) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

609780	TITLE *609780 CARBOXYPEPTIDASE, VITELLOGENIC-LIKE; CPVL
;;HVLP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using differential display PCR to identify macrophage-restricted genes,
Mahoney et al. (2001) identified and subsequently cloned a novel serine
carboxypeptidase, which they called CPVL, from human spleen cDNA. CPVL
encodes a deduced 476-amino acid protein with a 22-amino acid putative
signal peptide, 4 potential N-linked glycosylation sites, an intact
serine carboxypeptidase active site, and strong similarity to a large
number of serine carboxypeptidases from higher and lower eukaryotes.
CPVL shares 43% sequence identity with the vitellogenic carboxypeptidase
protein that is expressed in mosquito ovaries. RT-PCR revealed strong
CPVL expression in monocytic cells lines, but not in cell lines
representing B cells, fibroblasts, or epithelial cells. Northern blot
analysis of human tissues detected a CPVL transcript in
monocyte/macrophage-rich sources including spleen, leukocytes and
placenta, but also in heart and kidney, suggesting a role for CPVL
outside of the immune system. CPVL rabbit antiserum detected a protein
of about 67 kD on Western blots of lysates from transfected cells, but a
58-kD band in primary human macrophages. Mahoney et al. (2001)
speculated that this difference may represent removal of a propeptide
from CPVL in macrophages.

GENE FUNCTION

By Western blot analysis, Mahoney et al. (2001) found that expression of
CPVL is induced during the maturation of monocytes into macrophages.
Although the authors found no CPVL protein in monocytes, Northern blot
analysis indicated that monocytes express CPVL mRNA in amounts
comparable to mature macrophages, implying that macrophage lineage
expression of CPVL protein is regulated at the level of translation
rather than transcription. Western blots did not detect CPVL protein in
lymphocytes or neutrophils.

GENE STRUCTURE

Mahoney et al. (2001) determined that the CPVL gene contains 13 exons
and encompasses more than 150 kb. The sizes of the introns vary widely,
from 398 bp to nearly 35 kb.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Mahoney et al. (2001) mapped the CPVL gene to
chromosome 7p15-p14.

;;ACETYLSEROTONIN METHYLTRANSFERASE-LIKE, X-LINKED; ASMTLX
DESCRIPTION The human Y chromosome is an extreme case with respect to recombination
frequencies. Over most of its entire length, the Y chromosome is
virtually a nonrecombining chromosome. At its distal ends, however,
within the 2 X-Y homologous pseudoautosomal regions (PAR1 and PAR2),
recombination frequencies are extremely high. Indeed, PAR1 on Xp/Yp
exhibits one of the highest recombination rates in male meiosis in the
human genome. This is due to the fact that males have an obligatory
crossover within the 2.6-Mb region of PAR1 (Rappold, 1993). The
preponderance of gene families expressed specifically in the testes has
been described on the nonrecombining portion of the human Y chromosome
(Lahn and Page, 1997). This has raised questions about the evolutionary
forces that led to their creation as well as to the molecular mechanisms
involved. In contrast, the evolution of genes and gene families in the
recombining portion of Y is likely to follow very different principles.
For example, the high frequency of recombination may have rendered this
region more prone to unequal crossing over, leading to gene duplications
in the ancestral PAR1 region. Ried et al. (1998) stated that to that
time 9 genes and 1 pseudogene had been characterized within PAR1. Only 2
of them, ASMT (300015) and XE7 (312095), had been characterized as
'single' genes, whereas all the others had close relatives in the genome
or were duplicated within PAR1. In this connection, Ried et al. (1998)
isolated a novel pseudoautosomal gene, ASMTL (N-acetylserotonin
O-methyltransferase-like), showing significant homology to the ASMT
gene. ASMT is an enzyme catalyzing the last step in the synthesis of
melatonin, a hormone that depresses body temperature and facilitates
sleep onset by inducing the circadian rhythm. It is exclusively
expressed in brain, retina, and pineal gland. Besides the homology of
ASMTL to ASMT in its 3-prime part, the N-terminal part of ASMTL is
similar to the entire length of the multicopy associated filamentation
(maf) protein of Bacillus subtilis and to orfE of Escherichia coli, gene
products involved in the regulation of cell division and growth. The
bipartite structure suggested that ASMTL is the product of a gene fusion
event, during which 2 different full-length genes are joined to form a
single gene. Ried et al. (1998) also detected the identity of 1 exon
(1A) of ASMT to exon 3 in yet another pseudoautosomal gene, XE7. The
data suggested that exon duplication and exon shuffling as well gene
fusion may represent common characteristics of the evolution of the
pseudoautosomal region.

Ried et al. (1998) found that ASMTL resides proximal to and in the close
vicinity of ANT3 (300151). The cosmid used in the initial cDNA selection
approach contained not only the 3-prime end of ASMTL but also the entire
ANT3 gene. ANT3 had previously been shown to be associated with a CpG
island located approximately 1,300 kb from the telomere. Sequencing
indicated that the 5-prime end of ASMTL is located approximately 1,350
kb from Xptel. Thus, the homologous genes ASMTL and ASMT (previously
mapped 1,700-1,800 kb from Xptel) reside within 500 kb in the middle
portion of PAR1.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Multiple growth factors synergistically stimulate proliferation of
hematopoietic progenitor cells. Using an expression cloning method,
Hiraoka et al. (1997) obtained a cDNA encoding a predicted 245-amino
acid protein, which they called SCGF. The authors found that SCGF
possesses burst-promoting activity, granulocyte/macrophage
(GM)-promoting activity, and colony-forming unit/GM-sustaining effects.
Northern blot analysis detected low-level expression of a 1.6-kb SCGF
transcript in all tissues tested, and a 2.6-kb SCGF transcript was also
detected in heart.

Using RT-PCR analysis on single-stranded cDNA from human bone marrow
poly(A) RNA, Mio et al. (1998) obtained a full-length SCGF cDNA encoding
a deduced 323-amino acid protein, which they named SCGF-alpha; they
designated the shorter clone isolated by Hiraoka et al. (1997)
SCGF-beta. Northern blot analysis detected an SCGF transcript of
approximately 1.4 to 1.6 kb in many human tissues, including spleen,
thymus, appendix, bone marrow, and fetal liver, with low expression in
peripheral blood leukocytes. An additional transcript of 2.2 to 2.4 kb
was detected in thymus and bone marrow.

Using degenerate PCR primers based on the sequence of a purified 47-kD
protein, p47, secreted by HIV-1-infected T cells fused with embryonic
fibroblasts, Bannwarth et al. (1998) cloned a cDNA encoding SCGF, which
they called LSLCL (lymphocytic secreted long form of C-type lectin).
Sequence analysis revealed a 21-amino acid signal peptide; a
glutamate-rich N-terminal domain, which includes an arg-gly-asp triplet;
a leucine zipper; and a C-terminal C-type lectin domain, which is known
to be a carbohydrate recognition domain. The authors found O-glycan
attachment sites but no N-glycosylation sites. Northern blot analysis
detected a 1.4-kb transcript that was strongly expressed in T and B
lymphoblastoid, weakly expressed in monocytoid cell lines, and not
expressed in fibroblasts. Strong expression was detected in bone marrow,
with weak expression detected in all other tissues tested. Bannwarth et
al. (1998) argued that the structure of SCGF is reminiscent of
collectins (see 178635) rather than of growth factors.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bannwarth et al. (1999) reported that the SCGF gene contains 4 exons.

MAPPING

Using FISH, Mio et al. (1998) mapped the SCGF gene to chromosome
19q13.3. By genomic Southern blot analysis, Bannwarth et al. (1999)
mapped the gene to the same locus.

Mio et al. (1998) mapped the mouse Scgf gene to chromosome 7B3-B5 using
FISH.

300383	TITLE *300383 COMPLEMENT FACTOR PROPERDIN; CFP
;;PROPERDIN P FACTOR, COMPLEMENT; PFC;;
PROPERDIN;;
FACTOR P
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Properdin (factor P) is a plasma protein that is active in the
alternative complement pathway of the innate immune system. It is a
positive regulatory factor that binds to many microbial surfaces to
stabilize the C3b,Bb convertase. The C3b,Bb convertase then rapidly
cleaves more C3 to C3b, which acts either as an opsonin or to reinitiate
the pathway in an amplification loop that proceeds on the bacterial
cell, but not on the host cell (Janeway et al., 2001). In the
alternative pathway, C3 is thus activated through factor B, factor D,
and properdin P, under the control of factors I and H (Fearon and
Austen, 1980). Deficiency of properdin is associated in particular with
a heightened susceptibility to Neisseria species (Janeway et al., 2001).

MAPPING

The deficiency state of properdin (CFPD; 312060) in humans led to the
identification and mapping of the properdin gene.

Goundis et al. (1989) used a genomic clone of properdin for
hybridization to a panel of DNA from somatic cell hybrids retaining
different portions of the human X chromosome and localized the gene to
Xp11.4-cen. Furthermore, in situ hybridization using the same probe
refined the localization to Xp21.1-p11.23.

In a restudy of a Tunisian Jewish family studied by Schlesinger et al.
(1990), Ash et al. (1994) found linkage to DXS7 and one recombinant with
DXS255, which had been found by Wadelius et al. (1992) to be tightly
linked to properdin deficiency.

Coleman et al. (1991) used a CA repeat found within 16 kb of the PFC
gene to map the locus in CEPH families. The likely order was
Xpter--MAOA--PFC--TIMP--Xcen. This places PFC in the region
Xp11.3-p11.23. PFC and TIMP were found to be located on the same 100 kb
DNA fragment. By detailed restriction mapping, Derry and Barnard (1992)
showed that the properdin gene lies within 5 kb of the 5-prime end of
the synapsin I gene (313440).

Evans et al. (1989) mapped the properdin locus to a specific region of
the mouse X chromosome by in situ hybridization. In addition to the
major site of hybridization in a position predicted by the mapping of
the homologous human locus to Xp21.1-p11.23, a second site of
hybridization was observed. Laval et al. (1991) showed that in the mouse
the Timp locus (305370) could not be separated from the properdin factor
in a panel of 18 recombinant animals. The 2 loci mapped between
monoamine oxidase-A and Hprt.

GENE STRUCTURE

Nolan et al. (1992) found that the PFC gene contains 10 exons and spans
approximately 6 kb.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Westberg et al. (1995) used direct solid-phase sequencing of the gene to
identify point mutations in type I and type II properdin deficiency
defined as absent or low serum properdin, respectively. In a Dutch
family, Fredrikson et al. (1996) identified a mutation in type III
properdin deficiency, defined as the presence of a dysfunctional
properdin protein in serum.

In 10 Dutch families, van den Bogaard et al. (2000) identified the
genetic defect responsible for properdin type I deficiency. All amino
acid substitutions were limited to conserved amino acids in exons 7 and
8, in contrast to premature stops that were found in other exons.
Missense mutations may alter the protein conformation in such a way that
properdin will not be secreted and therefore catabolized
intracellularly. The decreased properdin levels found in some healthy
females carrying 1 mutated properdin gene were studied for X
inactivation. Most carriers with extremely low or high properdin levels
showed preferential X inactivation for the normal or mutated X
chromosome, respectively. The authors observed some exceptions, however,
suggesting additional regulation of properdin excretion apart from X
inactivation. Three unrelated families had the same mutation in exon 7
and another 3 unrelated families had the same mutation in exon 8,
suggesting founder effect; the families with an identical properdin
defect originated from the same regions within the Netherlands.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PROPERDIN DEFICIENCY, TYPE I
CFP, ARG134TER

In a family with type I properdin deficiency (312060) originally
reported by Sjoholm et al. (1982), Westberg et al. (1995) demonstrated a
nonsense mutation in exon 5 of the PFC gene: a C-to-T transition at
position 2767 of their genomic sequence which generated a stop codon TGA
at codon 134 and thus a truncated gene product containing the first 133
amino acid residues as compared with 442 amino acids in the mature
properdin protein. Four additional nucleotide mutations and introns were
found, as well as 1 silent mutation in exon 10. The authors stated that
the stop codon in exon 5 was not present in 3 other families with type I
deficiency.

.0002
PROPERDIN DEFICIENCY, TYPE II
CFP, ARG73TRP

In a family with type II properdin deficiency (312060) in an uncle and
nephew, manifested as low but not absent serum properdin (Sjoholm et
al., 1988), Westberg et al. (1995) found 2 nucleotide changes, both of
which, they thought, might contribute to a decreased expression of gene
product. One of the mutations involving base 2124 in exon 4 was a C-to-T
transition that changed a CGG (arg) codon to a TGG (trp) codon. (They
did not indicate to which codon number the mutation was attributed.) The
authors speculated that this mutation might cause the deficiency because
of the resultant difference in structure, ionic charge, and acidity
between the normal and mutated protein. The properdin protein may
alternatively fold improperly, resulting in reduced life-time and
secretion. In addition, Westberg et al. (1995) found in the affected
members in the same family a change from G-to-A at base 827 in intron 3
which, it was thought, might lead to a cryptic splice site with
incorrect splicing and functional deficiency of the resulting mRNA.

.0003
PROPERDIN DEFICIENCY, TYPE I
CFP, GLY271VAL

Van den Bogaard et al. (2000) found that affected members of a Dutch
family with type I properdin deficiency (312060) had a 3511G-T
transversion in exon 7 of the PFC gene, resulting in a gly271-to-val
amino acid substitution.

.0004
PROPERDIN DEFICIENCY, TYPE I
CFP, SER179TER

In affected members of a Dutch family with type I properdin deficiency
(312060), van den Bogaard et al. (2000) found a 3041C-G transversion in
exon 6 of the PFC gene, converting codon 179 from serine to stop.

.0005
PROPERDIN DEFICIENCY, TYPE III
CFP, TYR387ASP

In a Dutch family with properdin deficiency type III (312060),
Fredrikson et al. (1996) identified a T-to-G mutation in exon 9 of the
PFC gene, resulting in a tyr387-to-asp substitution.

143010	TITLE *143010 MAJOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY COMPLEX, CLASS I, E; HLA-E
;;HLAE;;
HLA-E HISTOCOMPATIBILITY TYPE;;
HLA-6.2;;
QA1, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; QA1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

As assessed by Southern blotting, the HLA class I gene family contains
15 to 20 members, many more than can be accounted for by the HLA-A, -B,
and -C genes (Orr, 1988). The HLA-E gene belongs to class I and is
situated about 650 kb from HLA-C (Carroll et al., 1987).

GENE FUNCTION

The protein HLA-E is a nonclassical MHC molecule of limited sequence
variability. Its expression on the cell surface is regulated by the
binding of peptides derived from the signal sequence of some other MHC
class I molecules. Braud et al. (1998) reported the identification of
ligands for HLA-E. Braud et al. (1998) constructed tetramers in which
recombinant HLA-E and beta-2 microglobulin (B2M; 109700) were refolded
with an MHC leader-sequence peptide, biotinylated, and conjugated to
Extravidin. This HLA-E tetramer bound to natural killer (NK) cells and a
small subset of T cells from peripheral blood. On transfectants, the
tetramer bound to the CD94/NKG2A (161555), CD94/NKG2B, and CD94/NKG2C
(602891) NK cell receptors, but did not bind to the immunoglobulin
family of NK cell receptors (KIRs; see 604936). Surface expression of
HLA-E was enough to protect target cells from lysis by CD94/NKG2A+ NK
cell clones. A subset of HLA class I alleles had been shown to inhibit
killing by CD94/NKG2A+ NK cell clones. Only the HLA alleles that possess
a leader peptide capable of upregulating HLA-E surface expression confer
resistance to NK cell-mediated lysis, implying that their action is
mediated by HLA-E, the predominant ligand for the NK cell inhibitory
receptor CD94/NKG2A.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

O'Callaghan et al. (1998) determined the crystal structure of human
HLA-E in complex with a prototypic ligand, the nonamer peptide
(VMAPRTVLL), derived from the highly conserved residues 3-11 of the
human MHC class Ia leader sequence. The mode of peptide binding retained
some of the standard features observed in MHC class Ia complexes, but
novel features implied that HLA-E has evolved to mediate specific
binding to a tightly defined set of almost identical hydrophobic
peptides from the highly conserved class I leader sequences. These
molecular adaptations make HLA-E a rigorous checkpoint at the cell
surface, reporting on the integrity of the antigen processing pathway to
CD94/NKG2 receptor-bearing natural killer cells.

MAPPING

The HLA-E gene maps to chromosome 6p21.3 (Carroll et al., 1987).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Ohya et al. (1990) studied polymorphism of HLA-E. The amino acid
sequence of the HLA-E molecule, especially the alpha-2 domain, is the
most divergent among HLA class I molecules. Ohya et al. (1990) found
little RFLP polymorphism in Japanese.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hu et al. (2004) generated a deletion in the 7-exon mouse Qa1 gene, the
homolog of human HLA-E, by replacing exons 1, 2, and 3 with positive and
negative selection markers. Infection with herpes simplex virus induced
keratitis associated with upregulated Ifng (147570) production by CD4 T
cells in mutant mice but not in the wildtype resistant background
strain. Mutant mice could not be protected from development of
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by preimmunization with
complete Freund adjuvant (CFA) before challenge with CFA containing
pertussis toxin. Qa1-deficient mice also had enhanced responses to
proteolipid protein self peptide that were associated with resistance of
CD4 T cells to Qa1-restricted CD8 T-suppressor cell activity. Hu et al.
(2004) concluded that a Qa1-dependent T cell-T cell inhibitory
interaction prevents the pathogenic expansion of autoreactive CD4 T-cell
populations and consequent autoimmune disease.

602764	TITLE *602764 KERATIN 35; KRT35
;;KERATIN, HAIR, ACIDIC, 5; KRTHA5;;
KERATIN, HARD, TYPE I, 5; HA5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

See KRTHA1 (601077) for general information on hair keratins.

CLONING

Rogers et al. (1996) identified the KRTHA5 gene, which they called HA5,
while studying the HA2 (KRTHA2; 602760) genomic sequence. Using the
partial HA5 genomic fragment to screen a human scalp cDNA library, the
authors isolated an HA5 cDNA. A comparison of the genomic and cDNA
sequences revealed the presence of an intron in the 3-prime noncoding
region. Together with the 6 conserved introns expected in the region
encoding the alpha-helical domain, the HA5 gene has 7 introns. The
predicted 425-amino acid HA5 protein contains a C-terminal domain with 8
cysteine and 10 proline residues. Its N-terminal domain lacks sequence
homology with the N-terminal domains of HA1 (KRTHA1), HA3A (KRTHA3A;
602761), HA3B (KRTHA3B; 602762), and HA4 (KRTHA4; 602763), all of which
are closely conserved in length and sequence. Northern blot analysis
detected a 1.8-kb HA5 transcript in human scalp but not in hairless
epidermis. In situ hybridization detected HA5 transcripts mainly in
supramatricial cells and lowermost cortical cells of the hair bulb,
indicating that HA5 is expressed early in hair morphogenesis;
transcripts were not detected in the cuticle. See Langbein et al. (1999)
for additional information on the expression pattern of the KRTHA5 gene
in the hair follicle.

Rogers et al. (1998) reported that the deduced KRTHA5 protein has 426
amino acids.

MAPPING

Rogers et al. (1996) located the HA5 gene 8 kb upstream of the HA2 gene
on 17q12-q21 and found that the 2 genes are oriented in the same
transcriptional direction.

Rogers et al. (1998) isolated and characterized 2 overlapping human PAC
clones that cover 190 kb on 17q12-q21 and contain 9 type I hair keratin
genes, 1 transcribed hair keratin pseudogene, and 1 orphan exon. The
order of the genes is 5-prime--KRTHA6 (604540)--KRTHA5--KRTHA2--orphan
exon--KRTHA8 (604542)--KRTHA7
(604541)--pseudogene--KRTHA1--KRTHA4--KRTHA3B--KRTHA3A--3-prime. The
hair keratin genes range in size from 4.2 to 7.5 kb, and the genes are
separated from each other by 5.5 to 18.4 kb; all are located within
about 140 kb. Except for KRTHA5, which has 8 exons, all of the genes
contain 7 exons. Each gene is transcribed from the 5-prime to 3-prime
direction. Based on sequence homologies, the genes can be grouped into 3
subclusters of tandemly arranged genes. One subcluster, group A,
consists of KRTHA1, KRTHA3A, KRTHA3B, and KRTHA4, which share 89%
overall amino acid identity. A second subcluster, group B, contains
KRTHA7 and KRTHA8, as well as the hair keratin pseudogene, which the
authors called HAA. The functional hair keratins and hypothetical HAA
hair keratin share approximately 81% overall amino acid identity. The
third subcluster, group C, consists of the structurally less related
hair keratins KRTHA2, KRTHA5, and KRTHA6, which share about 70% amino
acid identity.

607021	TITLE *607021 SEIZURE-RELATED 6-LIKE; SEZ6L
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Allelic losses on 22q are frequently found in small cell lung carcinomas
(SCLCs) and advanced non-small cell lung carcinomas, indicating the
presence of tumor suppressor gene(s) on that chromosome arm. In an SCLC
cell line, Nishioka et al. (2000) detected a homozygous deletion at
22q12.1. Cloning of the breakpoints revealed that the deletion was
interstitial and was 428,131 bp in size. The deleted region contained
the SEZ6L (seizure 6-like) gene, whose structure had been partially
determined by the chromosome 22 sequencing project (Dunham et al.,
1999). The SEZ6L cDNA contains a 3,072-bp open reading frame encoding a
1,024-amino acid transmembrane protein with multiple domains involved in
protein-protein interaction and signal transduction. SEZ6L expression
was detected in a variety of human tissues, including lung, while its
expression was detected in 14 (30%) of 46 lung cancer cell lines
examined. Missense mutations were detected in 3 (7%) of 46 cell lines,
and a 1-bp deletion in the polypyrimidine tract preceding exon 4 was
detected in 1 (2%) of 46 primary lung cancers. Therefore, Nishioka et
al. (2000) considered it possible that genetic and/or epigenetic SEZ6L
alterations are involved in the development and/or progression in a
subset of lung cancer, although functional analysis of the SEZ6L gene as
well as molecular analysis of other genes in the homozygously deleted
region would be necessary in order to understand the pathogenetic
significance of 22q deletions in human lung carcinogenesis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Nishioka et al. (2000) concluded that the SEZ6L gene consists of 17
exons within a 210-kb region.

MAPPING

Nishioka et al. (2000) identified the SEZ6L gene within a deletion at
chromosome 22q12.1.

GENE FUNCTION

SEZ6L was one of the genes studied by Suzuki et al. (2002) in a
microarray genome screen for genes upregulated by demethylation and
histone deacetylase inhibition in human colorectal cancer.

188070	TITLE *188070 THROMBOXANE A2 RECEPTOR, PLATELET; TBXA2R
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The TBXA2R gene encodes the thromboxane A2 receptor, which is a member
of the family of G protein-coupled receptors. It plays an essential role
in hemostasis by interacting with thromboxane A2 (TXA2) to induce
platelet aggregation (summary by Hirata et al., 1994). Thromboxane A2 is
an arachidonate metabolite that is a potent stimulator of platelet
aggregation and a constrictor of vascular and respiratory smooth
muscles. TXA2 has been implicated as a mediator in diseases such as
myocardial infarction, stroke, and bronchial asthma (summary by Ushikubi
et al., 1989).

CLONING

Ushikubi et al. (1989) purified the cell surface receptor for TXA2,
using a stable analog of TXA2. Using an oligonucleotide probe
corresponding to its partial amino acid sequence, Hirata et al. (1991)
obtained a cDNA encoding the receptor from human placenta and a partial
cDNA clone from cultured human megakaryocytic leukemia cells. The
placenta cDNA encoded a protein of 343 amino acids with 7 putative
transmembrane domains. The protein expressed in COS-7 cells bound drugs
with affinities identical to those of the platelet receptor, and that
expressed in Xenopus oocytes opened calcium-ion-activated chloride
channels on agonist stimulation. Northern blot analysis and nucleotide
sequences of the 2 clones suggested that an identical form of
thromboxane A2 receptor is present in platelets and vascular tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Two isoforms of the human TXA2 receptor have been cloned: one from
placenta and the other from endothelium, referred to as TXR-alpha and
TXR-beta, respectively. These isoforms differ only in their C-terminal
tails. Hirata et al. (1996) found that both isoforms are present in
human platelets. The 2 isoforms expressed in cultured cells show similar
ligand-binding characteristics and phospholipase C activation but
oppositely regulated adenylyl cyclase activity: TXR-alpha activates
adenylyl cyclase, while TXR-beta inhibits it.

GENE STRUCTURE

Nusing et al. (1993) reported that the TBXA2R gene is present in the
genome in single copy, spans over 15 kb, and contains 3 exons divided by
2 introns. Intron 1 exists in the 5-prime noncoding region, 83 bp
upstream from the ATG start site, and is 6.3 kb long. Intron 2, with a
length of 4.3 kb, is located at the end of the sixth transmembrane
region, thereby separating it from the downstream coding sequences,
including the seventh transmembrane region and the 3-prime untranslated
region. By rapid amplification of 5-prime cDNA ends, Nusing et al.
(1993) determined transcription initiation sites starting in 2 different
putative promoter regions.

MAPPING

Using transcribed 3-prime untranslated DNA sequence polymorphisms,
Schwengel et al. (1993) localized the TBXA2R gene to chromosome 19 by
PCR amplification in a series of monochromosomal human/rodent somatic
cell hybrids. Linkage mapping placed TBXA2R closest to D19S120, with a
maximum lod = 19.55 at theta = 0.05 in the CEPH panel of DNAs.
Multipoint linkage analysis placed TBXA2R between the markers D19S120
and PMS207 on the telomeric end of 19p13.3.

Using fluorescence in situ hybridization of cloned genomic DNA to
metaphase chromosomes, Nusing et al. (1993) demonstrated that the TBXA2R
gene is located on 19p13.3. The map position was confirmed by Duncan et
al. (1995), who also noted minor in situ hybridization signals at
12q24.3-q24.4 and 15q25-q26.

Taketo et al. (1994) used the mouse homolog of the human TXA2 receptor
as a cDNA probe to map the gene in the mouse (Tbxa2r) to chromosome 10,
using a panel of DNA samples from an interspecific cross. The best gene
order suggested that TBXA2R is located distal to Myb and proximal to
Pah.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 2 unrelated families with an autosomal dominant
platelet-type bleeding disorder (BDPLT13; 614009) characterized by
defective platelet response to TBXA2, Hirata et al. (1994) identified a
heterozygous mutation in the TBXA2R gene (R60L; 188070.0001).

Mumford et al. (2010) concluded that heterozygosity for mutations in the
TBXA2R gene is sufficient to cause abnormal platelet functional
responses in vitro, but is insufficient to cause clinically significant
dysfunction in vivo.

Unoki et al. (2000) surveyed 29 possible candidate genes for bronchial
asthma for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genomic DNA from
Japanese patients. They identified 33 SNPs, only 4 of which had
previously been reported, among 14 of these genes. They also performed
association studies using 585 bronchial asthma patients and 343 normal
controls for these SNPs. Only 1 of the 33 SNPs showed a positive
association with bronchial asthma: a 924T-C polymorphism in the TBXA2R
gene, seen most often in adult patients.

ANIMAL MODEL

The actions of TXA2 are mediated by G protein-coupled
thromboxane-prostanoid (TP) receptors. TP receptors have been implicated
in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. To investigate the
physiologic functions of TP receptors, Thomas et al. (1998) generated TP
receptor-deficient mice by gene targeting. Tp -/- animals reproduced and
survived in expected numbers, and their major organ systems were normal.
Thromboxane agonist binding could not be detected in tissues from Tp -/-
mice. Bleeding times were prolonged in these mice and their platelets
did not aggregate after exposure to TXA2 agonists. Aggregation responses
after collagen stimulation were also delayed, although ADP-stimulated
aggregation was normal. In summary, Tp -/- mice had a mild bleeding
disorder and altered vascular responses to TXA2 and arachidonic acid.
Their studies suggested that most of the recognized functions of TXA2
are mediated by the single known Tp gene locus.

Cheng et al. (2002) demonstrated that injury-induced vascular
proliferation and platelet activation are enhanced in mice that are
genetically deficient in the PGI2 receptor (600022) but are depressed in
mice genetically deficient in the TXA2 receptor or treated with a TXA2
receptor antagonist. The augmented response to vascular injury was
abolished in mice deficient in both receptors. Thus, PGI2 modulates
platelet-vascular interactions in vivo and specifically limits the
response to TXA2. This interplay may help explain the adverse
cardiovascular effects associated with selective COX2 inhibitors, which,
unlike aspirin and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, inhibit PGI2 but
not TXA2.

Kabashima et al. (2003) used mice deficient in Tbxa2r to investigate the
role of TBXA2R in the immune system. They showed that Tbxa2r, which is
highly expressed in mouse spleen and thymus, is expressed on naive but
not memory T cells. Tbxa2r -/- mice were apparently normal, but they
developed marked cervical lymphadenopathy with disruption of the zonal
structure of lymph nodes with age. Contact hypersensitivity was also
enhanced in these mice. Treating cells with a TBXA2R agonist increased
random chemokinesis of naive T cells and inhibited adhesion of dendritic
cells (DCs) to T cells and DC-dependent T-cell proliferation. Kabashima
et al. (2003) concluded that TBXA2-TBXA2R signaling negatively regulates
DC-T cell interactions.

BLEEDING DISORDER, PLATELET-TYPE, 13, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
TBXA2R, ARG60LEU

In affected members of 2 unrelated families with autosomal dominant
platelet-type bleeding disorder-13 (BDPLT13; 614009) characterized by
defective platelet response to TBXA2, Hirata et al. (1994) identified a
heterozygous 179G-T transversion in the TBXA2R gene, resulting in an
arg60-to-leu (R60L) substitution in the first cytoplasmic loop. The
proband in 1 family was homozygous for the mutation and had a slightly
more severe phenotype. The families had been reported by Ushikubi et al.
(1987) and Fuse et al. (1993), respectively, who demonstrated impaired
platelet aggregation responses to TBXA2 and its analogs, despite a
normal response to thrombin. Expression of the mutant receptor in
Chinese hamster ovary cells by Hirata et al. (1994) showed decreased
agonist-induced second messenger formation despite normal ligand binding
affinities. Dominant inheritance of the disorder suggested that the
mutation produces a dominant-negative effect.

Hirata et al. (1996) showed that the R60L mutant of the TXR-alpha
isoform of the human TXA2 receptor, which had been shown to impair
phospholipase C activation, also impaired adenylyl cyclase stimulation,
whereas TXR-beta with the same mutation retained its activity to inhibit
adenylyl cyclase.

BLEEDING DISORDER, PLATELET-TYPE, 13, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
TBXA2R, ASP304ASN

In a 14-year-old white boy with mild mucocutaneous platelet-type
bleeding disorder-13 (BDPLT13; 614009) characterized by defective
platelet response to TBXA2, Mumford et al. (2010) identified a
heterozygous 910G-A transversion in the TBXA2R gene, resulting in an
asp304-to-asn (D304N) substitution in transmembrane domain 7. The
patient's father, who also carried the mutation, had no bleeding
symptoms. In vitro studies of platelets from both the boy and his father
showed impaired aggregation and ATP secretion responses to arachidonic
acid and a TBXA2R agonist. In vitro functional expression studies in CHO
cells showed normal surface membrane expression of the mutant protein,
but there was significantly decreased binding and a significant
reduction (more than 85%) in intracellular calcium levels in response to
a TBXA2R agonist compared to wildtype, consistent with a loss of
function. Noting the phenotypic differences between the boy and his
father, Mumford et al. (2010) speculated that the clinical bleeding
phenotype demonstrated by the boy represented the effect of the
heterozygous D304N mutation combined with an additional unidentified
hemostatic defect. Mumford et al. (2010) concluded that heterozygosity
for mutations in the TBXA2R gene is sufficient to cause abnormal
platelet functional responses in vitro, but is insufficient to cause
clinically significant dysfunction in vivo.

BLEEDING DISORDER, PLATELET-TYPE, 13, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
TBXA2R, VAL241GLY

In an individual whose platelets showed defective response to TBXA2 in
vitro, consistent with susceptibility to platelet-type bleeding
disorder-13 (BDPLT13; 614009), Flamm et al. (2012) identified a
heterozygous T-to-G transversion in exon 2 of the TBXA2R gene, resulting
in a val241-to-gly (V241G) substitution at a highly conserved residue in
the third intracellular loop of the receptor near the inner membrane. In
vitro functional expression studies showed normal expression of the
mutant receptor, but impaired calcium mobilization and aggregation in
response to a TBXA2 agonist. Because G protein signaling through ADP was
normal, Flamm et al. (2012) concluded that the mutation caused abnormal
coupling of TBXA2R to Gq, resulting in impaired calcium mobilization.
The individual's platelets also showed impaired response to the
anticoagulants aspirin and indomethacin, which inhibit the production of
thromboxane A2. The individual had no self-reported bleeding tendencies.

600869	TITLE *600869 G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR KINASE 6; GRK6
;;GPRK6
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By PCR on neutrophil cDNA using primers based on sequences of known
receptor kinases, Haribabu and Snyderman (1993) identified GPRK5
(600870) and GPRK6 sequences. Using a fragment of the GPRK6 PCR clone to
screen a cDNA library, they isolated a cDNA encoding GPRK6. Sequence
analysis predicted that the 544-amino acid GPRK6 protein contains the
conserved DLG (asp-leu-gly) and ENIL (glu-asn-ile-leu) motifs. Northern
blot analysis detected 2.1- and 2.9-kb GPRK6 transcripts in all tissues
tested, with strongest expression in placenta and skeletal muscle.

By screening a heart cDNA with the catalytic domains of BARK (ADRBK1;
109635), Benovic and Gomez (1993) isolated a cDNA encoding GRK6. The
576-amino acid GRK6 protein is 70% identical to GRK5. PAGE analysis
showed expression of a 66-kD protein from an insect cell line.

GENE FUNCTION

Benovic and Gomez (1993) found that GRK6 could phosphorylate rhodopsin
(RHO; 180380) in a light-dependent manner and ADRB2 (109690) in an
agonist-dependent manner. However, GRK6 was significantly less active
than BARK or GRK5 on these substrates.

Gaudreau et al. (2002) identified the leukotriene B4 receptor, BLT1
(LTB4R; 601531), as a substrate for GRK6. Thr308 in the BLT1 cytoplasmic
tail was critical for inositol phosphate production and GRK6-mediated
phosphorylation and desensitization of BLT1 signaling.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis, Haribabu and Snyderman (1993) mapped
the GPRK6 gene and a closely related gene to chromosomes 5 and 13,
respectively. Bullrich et al. (1995) mapped GPRK6 to 5q35 by analysis of
a rodent human hybrid panel. The GPRK6-related locus was found to map to
13pter-q21.

ANIMAL MODEL

Gainetdinov et al. (2003) noted that some GRKs have been shown to
phosphorylate G protein-coupled dopamine receptors, thereby regulating
their activity and mediating desensitization of the receptors. Using
immunohistochemistry, Gainetdinov et al. (2003) found that GRK6 is
expressed in striatal neurons receiving dopaminergic input, and that
postsynaptic D2/D3 dopamine receptors are physiologic targets of this
kinase. GRK6 knockout mice showed supersensitivity to the
locomotor-stimulating effects of psychostimulants, including cocaine and
amphetamine. In addition, these mice demonstrated an enhanced coupling
of striatal D2-like dopamine receptors to G proteins and augmented
response to direct dopamine agonists. Gainetdinov et al. (2003) noted
that supersensitivity of dopamine signaling has been postulated to be
involved in several brain disorders, including addiction.

Kavelaars et al. (2003) found that application of arachidonic acid to
the ears of Grk6 -/- mice induced significantly increased inflammatory
responses compared with wildtype mice. Neutrophils from Grk6 -/- mice
responded to leukotriene B4 with a prolonged increase in intracellular
calcium and actin polymerization. Kavelaars et al. (2003) concluded that
GRK6 deficiency leads to prolonged BLT1 signaling and increased
neutrophil migration.

116945	TITLE *116945 MINICHROMOSOME MAINTENANCE, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF, 2; MCM2
;;MITOTIN;;
CELL DIVISION CYCLE-LIKE 1; CDCL1;;
NUCLEAR PROTEIN BM28; BM28
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MCM2, also called CDCL1 and BM28, is a human nuclear protein that plays
an important role in 2 crucial steps of the cell cycle, namely, onset of
DNA replication and cell division (Mincheva et al., 1994). It is similar
to members of the family of early S-phase proteins.

CLONING

The replication of DNA occurs only once per cell cycle in eukaryotes.
Blow and Laskey (1988) attempted to explain this tight control by
proposing the existence of a hypothetical licensing factor that would
bind to chromatin during mitosis to permit DNA replication during the
ensuing S phase in Xenopus egg extracts. Kubota et al. (1995), Chong et
al. (1995), and Madine et al. (1995) identified a replication licensing
activity in a complex containing MCM/P1 family proteins in Xenopus
oocytes. Burkhart et al. (1995) showed that human MCM2 and MCM5 (602696)
proteins form a complex. Hu et al. (1993) reported cDNA sequences for 5
MCM/P1 family members.

MAPPING

Using plasmid DNA containing the complete coding sequence of the CDCL1
gene as a probe for fluorescence in situ hybridization, Mincheva et al.
(1994) mapped the gene to 3q21. From its localization, CDCL1 became a
candidate for an oncogene affected by chromosomal breaks in acute
myeloid leukemia (AML).

GENE FUNCTION

Tsuruga et al. (1997) reported the comparative analysis of the human MCM
proteins MCM2, MCM3 (602693), MCM5, and MCM7 (600592). The 4 MCM
proteins underwent unequal regulation, suggesting that they play
somewhat distinct roles in the regulation of the mammalian cell cycle.
The mRNA levels of these genes underwent cell cycle-dependent
oscillations with a peak at G1/S phase; they may be regulated by E2F
motifs (see E2F1; 189971), 2 of which were detected in the 5-prime
regulatory region of the MCM5 gene. In contrast, the levels of these MCM
proteins remained rather constant during the HeLa cell cycle. However,
their levels gradually increased in a variable manner as normal cells
progressed from G0 into the G1/S phase. In the G0 stage, the MCM2 and
MCM5 proteins were much less abundant than the MCM7 and MCM3 proteins.
This suggests that the MCM proteins are not present in stoichiometric
amounts and that only a proportion of these molecules actively
participate in cell cycle regulation as part of MCM complexes.

Using an improved method for constructing conditional degron mutants,
Labib et al. (2000) demonstrated that depletion of minichromosome
maintenance protein complexes after initiation irreversibly blocks the
progression of replication forks in S. cerevisiae. Their experiments
demonstrated that MCM complex is loaded at origins before initiation and
is essential for elongation. Disruption of any one of the MCMs resulted
in cells that were unable to complete the S phase, indicating that all
MCM proteins are equally important for chromosome replication to
continue after the activation of early origins of DNA replication. Labib
et al. (2000) concluded that restricting MCM loading to the G1 phase
ensures that initiation and elongation occur just once per cell cycle.

The MCM2-7 complex is comprised of 6 subunits, MCM2 through MCM7, and is
a ring-shaped heterohexameric ATPase involved in DNA replication. In
Xenopus egg extracts, Pacek et al. (2006) showed that the MCM2-7
complex, the GINS complex (see GINS1; 610608), and Cdc45 (CDC45L;
603465) were enriched at stalled replication forks. They proposed that
these components unwind DNA and separate DNA strands at replication
forks.

Groth et al. (2007) characterized the complex in which the human histone
chaperone ASF1 (see 609189) and MCM2-7, the putative replicative
helicase, are connected through a histone H3-H4 bridge. Depletion of
ASF1 by RNA interference impeded DNA unwinding at replication sites, and
similar defects arose from overproduction of new histone H3-H4 that
compromised ASF1 function. Groth et al. (2007) concluded that their data
link ASF1 chaperone function, histone supply, and replicative unwinding
of DNA in chromatin. Groth et al. (2007) proposed that ASF1, as a
histone acceptor and donor, handles parental and new histones at the
replication fork via an ASF1-(H3-H4)-MCM2-7 intermediate and thus
provides a means to fine-tune replication fork progression and histone
supply and demand.
