DESCRIPTION Powers et al. (1993) demonstrated that the gamma subunit of the skeletal
muscle and neuronal dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channel is encoded
by a gene located on 17q11.2-q24 in the same region as the gene for the
beta-1 subunit (114207).

Iles et al. (1993) excluded this gene as the site of the mutation in a
considerable number of families with malignant hyperthermia
susceptibility in which there was no linkage to chromosome 19. They
estimated that the CACNLG locus is about 19 cM distal to the SCN4A
(603967) and GH1 (139250) loci, which in turn are about 32 cM telomeric
of the HOX2B locus (142961), on chromosome 17. Iles et al. (1993) mapped
the CACNLG gene to 17q24 by in situ hybridization. They also identified
a polymorphic repetitive DNA sequence in the gene locus and proposed its
use in investigating whether the gene plays a role in malignant
hyperthermia and other disorders mapping to 17q.

;;ALPHA ACCESSORY FACTOR, 132-KD SUBUNIT; AAF132;;
CHROMOSOME 17 OPEN READING FRAME 68; C17ORF68
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CTC1 and OBFC1 (613128) are subunits of an alpha accessory factor (AAF)
that stimulates the activity of DNA polymerase-alpha-primase (see
176636), the enzyme that initiates DNA replication (Casteel et al.,
2009). CTC1 also functions in a telomere-associated complex with OBFC1
and TEN1 (C17ORF106; 613130) (Miyake et al., 2009).

CLONING

Casteel et al. (2009) cloned mouse Aaf132, which encodes a deduced
1,211-amino acid protein. By database analysis, they identified human
AAF132. The human and mouse proteins share 69% identity. Northern blot
analysis detected variable Aaf132 expression in several mouse tissues,
with highest expression in testis. Endogenous Aaf132 protein had an
apparent molecular mass of 132 kD by SDS-PAGE. Aaf44 and Aaf132
colocalized in nuclei of transfected synchronized HeLa cells, with
exclusion from nucleoli. The 2 proteins colocalized with PCNA (176740),
presumably within DNA replication foci.

By searching databases for homologs of mouse Ctc1, Miyake et al. (2009)
identified human CTC1. The deduced 1,217-amino acid human protein has 2
oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) folds in its N-terminal
half and a third OB fold near the C terminus. OB folds are typically
found in proteins that bind single-stranded DNA (ssDNA).
Immunohistochemical analysis and FISH revealed that CTC1 colocalized
with telomeric DNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Using immunoprecipitation analysis, Casteel et al. (2009) showed that
epitope-tagged mouse Aaf44 and Aaf132 interacted in transfected HEK293
cells. Expression of Aaf44 appeared to stabilize the Aaf132 protein.
When expressed individually, Aaf44 and Aaf132 weakly bound
single-stranded oligo(dC), but when expressed together, they showed
strong ssDNA binding. When coexpressed, Aaf44 and Aaf132 formed an AAF
complex that stimulated DNA primase activity by calf or human
polymerase-alpha-primase on a poly(dT) template.

Using Western blot analysis of coimmunoprecipitated proteins and yeast
2-hybrid assays, Miyake et al. (2009) showed that CTC1 interacted with
STN1 (OBFC1) and TEN1 in a complex, which the authors called the CST
complex. STN1 interacted with both CTC1 and TEN1, but CTC1 and TEN1 did
not show significant interaction. The CST complex immunoprecipitated
telomeric DNA, but not Alu repeat DNA, from HeLa cells. Only a fraction
of telomeres associated with the CST complex, and association of the CST
complex with telomeres did not vary during the cell cycle. The CST
complex, but not its individual components, bound ssDNA with high
affinity and in a sequence-independent manner. The CST complex appeared
to protect telomeres independently of POT1 (606478). Knockdown studies
suggested that the CST complex and POT1 play redundant roles in telomere
protection.

Chen et al. (2012) demonstrated that the human CST complex, implicated
in telomere protection and DNA metabolism, inhibits telomerase (see
602322) activity through primer sequestration and physical interaction
with the POT1-TPP1 (609377) telomerase processivity factor. CST competes
with POT1-TPP1 for telomeric DNA, and CST-telomeric-DNA binding
increases during late S/G2 phase only on telomerase action, coinciding
with telomerase shut-off. Depletion of CST allows excessive telomerase
activity, promoting telomere elongation. Chen et al. (2012) proposed
that through binding of the telomerase-extended telomere, CST limits
telomerase action at individual telomeres to approximately one binding
and extension event per cell cycle. The authors suggested that their
findings defined the sequence of events that occur to first enable and
then terminate telomerase-mediated telomere elongation.

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the C17ORF68 gene to chromosome 17p13.1 based on an
alignment of the C17ORF68 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK025823) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

Casteel et al. (2009) mapped the mouse Aaf132 gene to chromosome 11.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected individuals from 10 families with Coats plus syndrome, which
is a form of cerebroretinal microangiopathy with calcifications and
cysts (CRMCC; 612199), Anderson et al. (2012) identified 14 different
mutations in the CTC1 gene (see, e.g., 613129.0001-613129.0005). The
first mutations were found by exome sequencing of a sib pair. All
patients were compound heterozygous for 2 mutations. Three patients were
found to have shortened telomere lengths in white blood cells, and
heterozygous family members had telomere lengths at the lower range of
normal. Cell lines derived from 2 patients showed an increase in
spontaneous H2AX histone (601772)-positive cells, indicating an ongoing
DNA damage response. The phenotype was somewhat variable, but most
patients had intrauterine growth retardation, intracranial
calcifications, leukoencephalopathy, early-onset retinal changes,
early-onset bone fractures, and gastrointestinal ectasia. Some had hair,
nail, and skin changes, and/or anemia. Noting the role of CTC1 in DNA
replication, Anderson et al. (2012) concluded that mutations in the CTC1
gene may disrupt DNA metabolism and telomere integrity. Sequencing
excluded mutations in the CTC1 gene in 21 probands with Labrune
syndrome, defined as intracranial calcifications and leukoencephalopathy
without extraneurologic features, suggesting that these 2 disorders may
not be allelic, even though they show phenotypic overlap.

Polvi et al. (2012) identified compound heterozygous mutations in the
CTC1 gene (see, e.g., 613129.0006-613129.0011) in 13 of 15 patients with
cerebroretinal microangiopathy with calcifications and cysts. The
mutations were found by whole-exome sequencing in 4 apparently unrelated
Finnish patients, followed by Sanger sequencing of the CTC1 gene in 11
additional patients from 10 families. Ten of the 15 patients had
previously been reported (see, e.g., Linnankivi et al., 2006 and Briggs
et al., 2008). A total of 11 mutations were found, 2 of which were
recurrent (V665G, 613129.0006 and 2831delC, 613129.0007). Ten of the 12
families carried a missense mutation on 1 allele and a truncating
mutation on the other allele. Only 1 patient carried 2 in-frame
deletions, likely resulting in a protein product with altered functional
properties; this patient had few extracranial manifestations. Since no
patient carried 2 truncating mutations, it appeared likely that such a
combination would be lethal in utero. CTC1 mutations were found in all
patients with childhood onset of the disorder and with retinal
involvement. Two of 3 patients with later onset and lack of clinical
retinal anomalies did not carry CTC1 mutations; these 2 patients did not
have systemic findings. There were no differences in telomere lengths in
patients with CTC1 mutations compared to controls, suggesting that
telomere integrity is not severely compromised in this disorder.

CEREBRORETINAL MICROANGIOPATHY WITH CALCIFICATIONS AND CYSTS
CTC1, 4-BP DEL, 724AAAG

In 2 Scottish sisters and an unrelated English patient, all with Coats
plus syndrome (612199), Anderson et al. (2012) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the CTC1 gene: a 4-bp deletion
(724delAAAG) in exon 5, resulting in a frameshift and premature
termination, and a 2959C-T transition in exon 18, resulting in an
arg987-to-trp (R987W; 613129.0002) substitution. The missense mutation
affected a residue well-conserved among mammals, and neither mutation
was found in 1,730 controls. The patients had previously been reported
by Briggs et al. (2008). All had intrauterine growth retardation,
intracranial calcifications, leukoencephalopathy, early-onset retinal
changes, and gastrointestinal ectasia. The sisters both had gray hair,
translucent skin, and dystrophic nails, and the English patient had
anemia. One of the sisters and the English patient had early-onset bone
fractures. The 2 sisters died in their early twenties of
gastrointestinal bleeding. One of the patients was found to have
shortened telomere lengths in white blood cells, and each heterozygous
parent had telomere lengths at the lower range of normal.

Keller et al. (2012) reported an 18-year-old girl who was compound
heterozygous for 724delAAAG and a 3-bp deletion (613129.0012) in the
CTC1 gene. The patient presented at age 15 years with classic features
of dyskeratosis congenita (see, e.g., 127550), including bone marrow
failure, abnormalities in skin pigmentation, nail dysplasia, and graying
hair. She also had short stature, osteopenia, decreased pulmonary
function, and blurry vision associated with sheathed vessels and
microaneurysm formation in the retina. Brain MRI showed calcifications
in the right thalamus, and telomeres were shortened significantly.
Neurologic function was normal. Patient fibroblasts showed a defect in
outgrowth as well as rapid senescence compared to controls. Keller et
al. (2012) noted that both CTC1 mutations had been reported in patients
with Coats plus syndrome, suggesting that Coats plus syndrome and DKC
show phenotypic and genetic overlap, consistent with a telomere-related
disease.

In a 28-year-old English woman with Coats plus syndrome (612199),
Anderson et al. (2012) identified compound heterozygosity for 2
mutations in the CTC1 gene: a 2611G-A transition in exon 15, resulting
in a val871-to-met (V871M) substitution, and a 4-bp deletion
(724delAAAG; 613129.0001). The missense mutation affected a residue
well-conserved among mammals, and was not found in 1,730 controls. The
patient had intrauterine growth retardation, intracranial
calcifications, leukoencephalopathy, early-onset retinal changes, thin
hair, dystrophic nails, anemia, early-onset bone fractures, absent
thumbs, and gastrointestinal ectasia. She died of pulmonary fibrosis at
age 28.

In 2 sibs, of English and Italian ancestry, with Coats plus syndrome
(612199), Anderson et al. (2012) identified compound heterozygosity for
2 mutations in the CTC1 gene: a 775G-A transition in exon 5, resulting
in a val259-to-met (V259M) substitution, and a 2518C-T transition in
exon 15, resulting in an arg840-to-trp (R840W; 613129.0005)
substitution. Both mutations affected residues well-conserved among
mammals, and were not found in 1,730 controls. The patients had
previously been reported by Briggs et al. (2008). Both had intrauterine
growth retardation, intracranial calcifications, leukoencephalopathy,
early-onset retinal changes, and early-onset bone fractures. One had
anemia and gastrointestinal ectasia. Both died of neurologic
complications in their teens.

CTC1, VAL665GLY

In 7 unrelated patients with cerebroretinal microangiopathy with
calcifications and cysts (CRMCC; 612199), Polvi et al. (2012) identified
compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the CTC1 gene. All were
heterozygous for a 1994T-G transversion in exon 12, resulting in a
val665-to-gly (V665G) substitution. The pathogenic mechanism of this
mutation was unclear because it does not affect a known functional
domain. Four of the patients carried a 1-bp deletion (2831delC;
613129.0007) in exon 17, resulting in a frameshift and premature
termination, on the second allele. The V665G and 2831delC mutations were
identified by whole-exome sequencing. One patient had a 2-bp indel in
exon 22 (3425_3426delTCinsAT; 613129.0008) on the other allele; this
mutation was predicted to result in a leu1142-to-his (L1142H)
substitution. Another patient had a 3583C-T transition in exon 23 on the
other allele, predicted to result in an arg1195-to-ter (R1195X;
613129.0009) substitution. The seventh patient had a 680C-T transition
in exon 5 on the other allele, resulting in an ala227-to-val (A227V;
613129.0010) substitution. The A227V substitution affects the first
OB-fold domain and may interfere with DNA binding. Patients with the
V665G mutation on 1 allele had early onset of the disorder, between
birth and 1.5 years of age. Features included intrauterine growth
retardation, brain calcifications, leukoencephalopathy, and variable
neurologic features, including spasticity, ataxia, dystonia, and
cognitive decline. All had retinal anomalies of some sort, mostly
telangiectasia. More variable features included gastrointestinal
bleeding, sparse hair, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Four had died by
age 20 years; 3 were alive at the time of the report.

exon 5, resulting in an ala227-to-val (A227V) substitution, and a 1-bp
deletion in exon 6 (1058delC; 613129.0011), resulting in a frameshift
and premature termination. The A227V substitution affects the first
OB-fold domain and may interfere with DNA binding. The patients had
originally been reported by Linnankivi et al. (2006). Both had
intrauterine growth retardation. At ages 1 and 5 years, respectively,
they were found to have brain calcifications and leukoencephalopathy.
Neurologic features included spasticity, seizures, dystonia, and
cognitive decline. Both had retinal telangiectasia, gastrointestinal
bleeding, and osteopenia. Other features included sparse hair, anemia,
and thrombocytopenia. They died at ages 22 and 16 years, respectively.

Another patient with CRMCC reported by Polvi et al. (2012) was compound
heterozygous for A227V and V665G (613129.0006).

of cys985, and an 859C-T transition in exon 6, resulting in an
arg287-to-ter (R287X; 613129.0013) substitution. The patient, who had
previously been reported by Crow et al. (2004) as having Coats plus

613332	TITLE *613332 MEMBRANE-ASSOCIATED RING-CH FINGER PROTEIN 2; MARCH2
;;MARCH II
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MARCH2 is a member of the MARCH family of membrane-bound E3 ubiquitin
ligases (EC 6.3.2.19). MARCH enzymes add ubiquitin (see 191339) to
target lysines in substrate proteins, thereby signaling their vesicular
transport between membrane compartments. MARCH2 reduces surface
accumulation of several glycoproteins and appears to regulate early
endosome-to-trans-Golgi network (TGN) trafficking (Bartee et al., 2004;
Nakamura et al., 2005).

CLONING

Poxviruses and gamma-2 herpesviruses express ubiquitin ligases called K3
proteins that inhibit the surface expression of glycoproteins, including
major histocompatibility complex class I molecules (see 142800). By
searching a database for sequences similar to the functional domains of
viral K3 proteins, Bartee et al. (2004) identified 9 human MARCH
proteins, including MARCH2. The deduced MARCH2 protein contains a short
N terminus, followed by a RING-CH domain and 2 transmembrane domains.
MARCH2 shares about 60% identity with MARCH3 (613333) in the RING-CH and
transmembrane domains. Real-time PCR analysis showed that MARCH2 was
expressed at variable levels in all tissues examined, with highest
expression in heart. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed colocalization
of epitope-tagged MARCH2 with an endoplasmic reticulum marker and with a
lysosome marker.

Using RT-PCR, De Gassart et al. (2008) detected MARCH2 expression in
immature and mature human dendritic cells and in HeLa and human B-cell
lines, but not in monocytes.

Nakamura et al. (2005) cloned rat March2. Northern blot analysis of rat
tissues revealed ubiquitous March2 expression. Cell fractionation
experiments showed that March2 associated with endosomes and with plasma
membrane vesicles.

GENE FUNCTION

Bartee et al. (2004) showed that the isolated RING-CH domain of MARCH2
functioned as an E3 ubiquitin ligase in a reaction containing ubiquitin,
ATP, an E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme (see UBE1; 314370), and the E2
ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBCH2 (UBE2H; 601082), UBCH3 (CDC34;
116948), or UBCH5A (UBE2D1; 602961). Following transfection into HeLa
cells, MARCH2 downregulated the surface expression of cotransfected B7.2
(CD86; 601020) and endogenous TFR (TFRC; 190010).

Using immunoprecipitation analysis of a rat liver membrane fraction,
Nakamura et al. (2005) showed that rat March2 interacted directly with
syntaxin-6 (STX6; 603944). Overexpression of March2 in COS-7 cells
resulted in redistribution of syntaxin-6 and some syntaxin 6-interacting
SNARE proteins (e.g., VAMP3; 603657) into March2-positive vesicles.
Retrograde transport of Tgn38 (TGOLN2; 603062) and epitope-tagged furin
(FUR; 136950) to the TGN was perturbed. March2 overexpression in HeLa
cells reduced cell surface expression of TFR and transferrin (TF;
190000) uptake and interfered with delivery of internalized transferrin
to perinuclear recycling endosomes. March2 overexpression had no effect
on EGF (131530)-stimulated EGFR (131550) degradation via lysosomes. In a
number of cell lines, including HeLa cells, March2 overexpression caused
cell rounding and detachment from the culture dish. Depletion of
endogenous MARCH2 in HeLa cells by small interfering RNA perturbed the
TGN localization of transfected rat Tgn38 and endogenous syntaxin-6 and
TGN46, the human homolog of rat Tgn38. Mutation of a C-terminal class I
PDZ-binding motif altered the subcellular localization of March2, with
some March2 accumulation within the endoplasmic reticulum. Nakamura et
al. (2005) concluded that MARCH2 is likely a regulator of early
endosome-to-TGN vesicle trafficking.

MAPPING

Hartz (2010) mapped the MARCH2 gene to chromosome 19p13.2 based on an
alignment of the MARCH2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF151074) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

603102	TITLE *603102 CARBOXYPEPTIDASE D; CPD
;;GLYCOPROTEIN, 180-KD; GP180
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The metallocarboxypeptidase family of enzymes is divided into 2
subfamilies, the pancreatic carboxypeptidase subfamily (e.g., CPA1;
114850) and the regulatory B-type carboxypeptidase subfamily (e.g.,
CPN1; 603103), based on sequence similarities. In membrane fractions of
mammalian cells, McGwire et al. (1997) identified a novel regulatory
B-type carboxypeptidase that they designated carboxypeptidase D, or CPD.
CPD is homologous to duck gp180, a hepatitis B virus-binding protein.

By searching databases to identify human homologs of gp180, Tan et al.
(1997) isolated cDNAs encoding CPD. The predicted 1,377-amino acid
protein contains a signal sequence, 3 tandem carboxypeptidase homology
domains, and a C-terminal putative transmembrane domain. The 3
carboxypeptidase domains have sequence similarity to the regulatory
B-type carboxypeptidase family. Overall, the amino acid sequences of CPD
and gp180 are 75% identical. Northern blot analysis revealed CPD
expression as multiple mRNAs in pancreas, placenta, heart, and skeletal
muscle.

By screening human hepatoblastoma cell and mouse liver cDNA libraries
for homologs of duck gp180, Ishikawa et al. (1998) isolated full-length
cDNAs encoding CPD. The predicted 1,380-amino acid human protein shares
91% identity with mouse Cpd, and both contain 3 carboxypeptidase domains
(A, B, and C), 15 potential N-linked glycosylation sites, a
transmembrane domain, and a conserved cytoplasmic tail. Northern blot
analysis detected a 5.5-kb transcript in all human tissues examined, and
8.0- and 10.0-kb transcripts were also present in heart, skeletal
muscle, and pancreas.

GENE FUNCTION

Ishikawa et al. (1998) found that expression of human CPD in embryonic
kidney cells significantly increased carboxypeptidase activity.

By mutation analysis, Eng et al. (1998) mapped carboxypeptidase activity
to domains A and B of duck gp180. They mapped binding of duck hepatitis
B virus preS protein to domain C.

Breiner et al. (1998) and Tong et al. (1999) independently showed that
duck Cpd bound duck hepatitis B virus, but they found that it did not
render mammalian cells permissive for productive infection. Breiner et
al. (1998) suggested that a coreceptor may be necessary for entry into
cells, and Tong et al. (1999) suggested that other factors may be
necessary for postentry events.

Campbell et al. (1999) found that gp180 expressed on intestinal
epithelial cells associated with CD1D (188410) on the cell surface and
activated T-lymphocyte FYN (137025) in a CD1D-dependent manner.

Campbell et al. (2002) determined that carbohydrate on gp180 interacted
with CD8 (see 186910)-positive T cells, but not CD4 (186940)-positive T
cells, at a site distinct from that bound by class I MHC molecules. The
gp180-CD8 interaction led to LCK (153390) activation.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell hybrid panels, Riley et al. (1998) mapped
the CPD gene to the centromeric region 17p11.1-q11.2. Using FISH,
Ishikawa et al. (1998) mapped the CPD gene to chromosome 17q11.2.

610435	TITLE *610435 LYMPHOCYTE ANTIGEN 6 COMPLEX, LOCUS G6C; LY6G6C
;;G6C
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

LY6G6C belongs to a cluster of leukocyte antigen-6 (LY6) genes located
in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class III region on
chromosome 6. Members of the LY6 superfamily typically contain 70 to 80
amino acids, including 8 to 10 cysteines. Most LY6 proteins are attached
to the cell surface by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor that
is directly involved in signal transduction (Mallya et al., 2002).

CLONING

By EST database searching and RT-PCR analysis, Mallya et al. (2002)
obtained a full-length LY6G6C cDNA. The predicted protein contains an
N-terminal signal peptide, followed by a cys-rich LY6 domain and a
C-terminal hydrophobic region. RT-PCR detected a 378-bp product in all
cell lines and fetal and adult tissues tested.

GENE STRUCTURE

Mallya et al. (2002) determined that the LY6G6C gene contains 3 exons
and spans about 2.5 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Mallya et al. (2002) mapped the LY6G6C
gene to a LY6 gene cluster within the MHC class III region on chromosome
6p21.3.

611417	TITLE *611417 SMALL G PROTEIN SIGNALING MODULATOR 1; SGSM1
;;KIAA1941
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching a region of chromosome 22 for protein-coding sequences,
followed by RT-PCR and RACE of an adult brain cDNA library, Yang et al.
(2007) cloned SGSM1, which had previously been cloned and named KIAA1941
by Nagase et al. (2001). Nagase et al. (2001) reported a deduced
1,233-amino acid protein with 2 RUN domains and a TBC domain, whereas
Yang et al. (2007) reported a deduced 1,093-amino acid protein with an
N-terminal RUN domain and a C-terminal TBC domain. By Northern blot
analysis, Yang et al. (2007) detected expression of a 7.0-kb SGSM1
transcript predominantly in adult heart, brain, kidney, pancreas, and
testis; in fetal brain, skeletal muscle, and heart; and in nearly all
specific adult brain regions examined. In mouse, Sgsm1 was detected only
in adult brain and there was evidence of splice variants. In situ
hybridization and immunohistochemical analysis of adult mouse brain
showed that Sgsm1 was predominantly expressed in the layer of Ammon's
horn (CA1, CA2, CA3), in dentate gyrus, hippocampus, granular and
Purkinje cell layer of cerebellum, and in neurons of the cerebral
cortex. Immunofluorescence analysis detected endogenous Sgsm1 associated
with the Golgi apparatus in a mouse neuroblastoma cell line.

GENE FUNCTION

Using immunoprecipitations and Western blot analysis with a mouse
neuroblastoma cell line, Yang et al. (2007) showed that SGSM1 interacted
with endogenous Rap1 (see RAP1A, 179520) and Rap2 (see RAP2A, 179540).
Further work with transfected cells and epitope-tagged proteins showed
SGSM1, as well as 2 other SGSM proteins, SGSM2 (611418), and SGSM3
(610440), coimmunoprecipitated with all RAP proteins examined, including
RAP1A, RAP1B (179530), RAP2A, and RAP2B (179541). Using deletion
mutants, Yang et al. (2007) identified a RAP-interacting domain (RAPID)
(amino acids 301-350), containing 5 conserved blocks of sequence
following the RUN motif, shared by all the SGSM proteins. Yang et al.
(2007) also found that endogenous Rab4 (179511) and Rab11 (see RAB11A,
605570) interacted with all of the SGSM proteins in the mouse
neuroblastoma cell line; however, Rab3 (see RAB3A, 179490), Rab5 (see
RAB5A, 179512), and Rab8 (see RAB8A, 165040) interacted only with SGSM1
and SGSM3.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yang et al. (2007) determined that the SGSM1 gene contains 25 exons.

MAPPING

By sequencing the euchromatic region of chromosome 22 as part of the
Human Genome Project, Yang et al. (2007) identified the SGSM1 gene on
chromosome 22q11.2.

;;1-@ACYL-sn-GLYCEROL 3-PHOSPHATE ACYLTRANSFERASE 5;;
LYSOPHOSPHATIDIC ACID ACYLTRANSFERASE, EPSILON;;
LPAAT-EPSILON
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

AGPAT5 is a member of a family of 1-acyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate
acyltransferases (EC 2.3.1.51), also known as lysophosphatidic acid
acyltransferases, that catalyze the acylation of lysophosphatidic acid
to phosphatidic acid, the precursor of all glycerolipids (summary by Lu
et al., 2005).

CLONING

Lu et al. (2005) cloned mouse Agpat5. The deduced 365-amino acid protein
has a putative N-terminal signal sequence and 3 transmembrane domains.
It contains catalytic and substrate-binding motifs and a third motif
conserved among AGPAT family members. RT-PCR analysis revealed variable
but ubiquitous Agpat4 expression in mouse tissues. Highest expression
was detected in brain, followed by skeletal muscle and heart.

Using real-time PCR, Prasad et al. (2011) found that AGPAT5 was variably
expressed in all human tissues examined. Fluorescence-tagged AGPAT5
localized to the ER and the nuclear envelope in transfected Chinese
hamster ovary cells and HeLa cells. It also localized to mitochondria.
Database analysis revealed orthologs of AGPAT5 in vertebrates and
insects, but not in plants.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a panel of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) acceptor molecules and
acyl-CoA donors, Prasad et al. (2011) found that AGPAT5 had a much
narrower substrate preference than AGPAT3 (614794), but both showed
preference for long-chain fatty acids. AGPAT5 showed a distinct
preference for C18:1-CoA as acyl acceptor over C20:4-CoA. AGPT5 was
active over a wide range of pH, functioning from pH 7.4 to 5.5.

GENE STRUCTURE

Prasad et al. (2011) determined that the AGPAT5 gene contains 8 exons.

MAPPING

Prasad et al. (2011) stated that the AGPAT5 gene maps to chromosome 8.

Hartz (2012) mapped the AGPAT5 gene to chromosome 8p23.1 based on an
alignment of the AGPAT5 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK002072) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

608472	TITLE *608472 ST6 BETA-GALACTOSAMIDE ALPHA-2,6-SIALYLTRANSFERASE 2; ST6GAL2
;;ST6GALII;;
KIAA1877
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Sialyltransferases, such as ST6GAL2 (EC 2.4.99.1), are type II
transmembrane proteins that catalyze the transfer of sialic acid from
CMP-sialic acid to an acceptor carbohydrate, usually to the terminal
ends of carbohydrate chains.

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult hippocampus
cDNA library, Nagase et al. (2001) cloned ST6GalII, which they
designated KIAA1877. The deduced protein contains 534 amino acids, and
the 3-prime untranslated region contains an Alu repetitive element.
ST6GalII shares 55% identity over 413 amino acids with chicken
CMP-N-acetylneuraminate beta-galactosamide-alpha-2. RT-PCR ELISA
detected intermediate expression in all tissues and specific brain
regions examined except skeletal muscle, pancreas, and spleen, where
little to no expression was detected.

By searching ESTs for sequences similar to ST6GalI (109675), followed by
RT-PCR of a colon cDNA library, Takashima et al. (2002) cloned ST6GalII.
The deduced 529-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of
60.2 kD. ST6GalII contains an N-terminal hydrophobic sequence
characteristic of type 2 transmembrane proteins followed by a stem
region, and sialyl motifs L (long), S (short), and VS (very short). The
VS motif contains the his and glu residues conserved among mammalian
sialyltransferases. The protein also contains 4 potential
N-glycosylation sites. The authors noted that the protein predicted by
their clone lacks 5 N-terminal amino acids predicted by KIAA1877. They
also found evidence for alternative splicing in some ST6GalII-related
clones. ST6GalII shares significant identity in sialyl motifs L and S
with other sialyltransferases, with highest sequence identity (48.9%)
shared with ST6GalI. Expression was below the level of detection by
Northern blot analysis; however, RT-PCR detected expression in small
intestine, colon, and fetal brain. Expression was very low in other
tissues.

By searching ESTs for sequences similar to ST6GalI, followed by RT-PCR
of neuroblastoma cell line tRNA, Krzewinski-Recchi et al. (2003) cloned
ST6GalII. Northern blot analysis detected an 8.0-kb transcript only in
brain. RNA dot blot analysis detected expression in lymph node, and to a
lesser extent in testis, thyroid gland, caudate nucleus, temporal lobe,
hippocampus, and fetal brain, kidney, thymus, and liver. Little to no
expression was detected in other tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Takashima et al. (2002) engineered recombinant ST6GalII that lacked the
transmembrane domain and was fused to protein A to ease purification.
This fusion protein, expressed by transfected COS-7 cells as a secreted
protein, exhibited alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase activity toward
oligosaccharides that have the Gal-beta-1,4-GlcNAc sequence at the
nonreducing end of their carbohydrate groups. It showed little activity
toward glycoproteins believed to contain the same carbohydrate group,
and no activity toward comparable glycolipids. Takashima et al. (2002)
concluded that ST6Gal1II is specific for oligosaccharide substrates.
Analysis of the products indicated that ST6GalII transfers sialic acid
on to galactose of Gal-beta-1,4-GlcNAc structure through an
alpha-2,6-linkage.

Krzewinski-Recchi et al. (2003) assayed ST6GalII lacking the first 33
N-terminal amino acids that was expressed in COS-7 cells as a soluble
secreted protein. They determined that the best acceptor substrates for
ST6GalII were the free disaccharide Gal-beta-1,4-GlcNAc and free
oligosaccharides lacto-N neotetraose and
Gal-beta-1,4-GlcNAc-beta-O-octyl.

GENE STRUCTURE

Takashima et al. (2002) determined that the ST6GalII gene contains at
least 8 exons and spans over 85 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis Nagase et al. (2001) mapped the ST6GalII
gene to chromosome 2. By genomic sequence analysis Takashima et al.
(2002) mapped the ST6GalII gene to chromosome 2q11.2-q12.1.

608684	TITLE *608684 NINEIN; NIN
;;GSK3B-INTERACTING PROTEIN;;
KIAA1565
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ninein is a centrosomal protein required for the centrosome to function
as a microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) and is essential for the
reformation of the interphase centrosome architecture following mitosis
(Ou et al., 2002).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned NIN, which they designated
KIAA1565. RT-PCR ELISA detected high NIN expression in ovary, spleen,
adult whole brain, and all individual brain regions examined. Expression
was intermediate in all other adult and fetal tissues examined except
testis, which showed no expression.

Using GSK3B (605004) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a fetal liver
cDNA library, followed by EST contig searching and 5-prime RACE of fetal
liver cDNA, Hong et al. (2000) cloned full-length NIN. The deduced
2,047-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 239 kD. NIN
contains an N-terminal GTP-binding site, a large coiled-coil domain with
4 leucine zipper motifs, and a C-terminal domain responsible for GSK
binding. Unlike mouse Nin, it does not have an N-terminal Ca(2+)-binding
site. Northern blot analysis detected a 9.0-kb transcript in all tissues
examined and a 7.0-kb transcript predominantly in heart and skeletal
muscle. Fluorescence-labeled NIN localized in the perinuclear foci
characteristic of centrosomes in transfected COS-1 cells.

Hong et al. (2000) cloned a splice variant of NIN, which they designated
ninein-lm (ninein like mouse) because the protein contains an N-terminal
Ca(2+)-binding site. This variant lacks intron 1 and utilizes an
alternate splice site in exon 2 that results in more 5-prime sequence of
exon 2. Ninein-lm encodes a deduced 2,041-amino acid protein with a
calculated molecular mass of 238 kD. RT-PCR and Southern blot analysis
indicated that ninein-lm expression was 20- to 50-fold higher than
ninein expression in all tissues tested except pancreas.

By Western blot analysis, Chen et al. (2003) determined that endogenous
HeLa cell ninein had an apparent molecular mass of about 230 kD.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hong et al. (2000) determined that the NIN gene contains 29 exons and
spans about 130 kb. The promoter region contains a TATA box, 2 CCAAT
boxes, and 3 GC boxes. It also has 4 Sp1 (189906)-binding sites, 2 p300
(602700)-binding sites, and 1 AP1 (165160)-binding site.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis and radiation hybrid analysis, Hong et al.
(2000) mapped the NIN gene to chromosome 14q22.

GENE FUNCTION

Hong et al. (2000) determined that the C termini of ninein and ninein-lm
bound GSK3B. The coiled-coil domain, but not the leucine-zipper domains,
mediated the interaction. The coiled-coil domain also mediated
oligomerization.

The mammalian centrosome consists of a pair of centrioles surrounded by
pericentriolar material (PCM). Ou et al. (2002) stated that a subset of
PCM proteins are arranged in a tubular conformation with an open and a
closed end within the centrosome. They found that, in the mother
centrosome, ninein and CEP110 (605496) were distributed at both ends of
the centrosome tube, including the site of centrosome duplication.
However, in the daughter centrosome, ninein and CEP110 were present only
at the closed end, where they colocalized with CEP250. The appearance of
ninein and CEP110 at the open end of the daughter centrosome occurred
during the telophase-G1 transition of the next cell cycle, concomitant
with the maturation of the daughter centrosome into a mother centrosome.
Microinjection of antibodies against either ninein or CEP110 into
metaphase HeLa cells disrupted the reformation of the tubular
conformation of proteins within the centrosome following cell division
and led to dispersal of centrosomal material throughout the cytosol.
Microinjection of antibodies to either ninein or CEP110 into metaphase
kangaroo rat kidney cells not only disrupted the tubular configuration
within the centrosome, but also affected the centrosome's ability to
function as an MTOC. Centrosomal architecture was not disrupted if
antibodies were microinjected into postmitotic cells with fully formed
centrosomes, but the MTOC function of the centrosomes was disrupted.

Chen et al. (2003) showed that the coiled-coil II (CCII) domain of
ninein, which contains a centrosome targeting signal, colocalized with
gamma-tubulin (191135) and centrin (see CENT1 603187) at the centrosome
of transfected HeLa cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that
ninein protein disappeared from spindle poles during metaphase and
anaphase, but reaccumulated at centrosomes at the end of cell division.
In vitro kinase assays indicated that the CCII domain was readily
phosphorylated by AIK (AURKA; 603072) and PKA (see 176911).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 sisters with severe short stature, microcephaly, and developmental
delay (Seckel syndrome-7; SCKL7, 614851), Dauber et al. (2012)
identified compound heterozygosity for missense mutations in the NIN
gene, Q1222R (608684.0001) and N1709S (608684.0002).

ANIMAL MODEL

Dauber et al. (2012) performed morpholino knockdown of ninein in
zebrafish and observed defects in the anterior neuroectoderm that
resulted in a deformity of the developing cranium, with a small, squared
skull highly reminiscent of the human phenotype.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SECKEL SYNDROME 7
NIN, GLN1222ARG

In 2 sisters with severe short stature, microcephaly, and developmental
delay (SCKL7; 614851), Dauber et al. (2012) identified compound
heterozygosity for a 3667G-A transition in exon 18 of the NIN gene,
resulting in a gln1222-to-arg (Q1222R) substitution, and a 5128A-G
transition in exon 23, resulting in an asn1709-to-ser (N1709S;
608684.0002) substitution; both substitutions occurred at evolutionarily
conserved residues. The unaffected parents were each heterozygous for 1
of the mutations, neither of which was present in the SNP database or
the NHLBI exome variant server; however, the Q1222R variant was present
in the 1000 Genomes pilot data, with an overall minor allele frequency
of 0.001. Functional analysis of patient fibroblasts suggested that the
compound heterozygous NIN defects did not disrupt ninein expression or
localization or affect mitotic functions in an obvious way.

;;POMZP3 FUSION PROTEIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Kipersztok et al. (1995) characterized an unusual human gene, which they
termed POMZP3, that appears to have resulted from a fusion of sequences
derived from 2 distinct loci. The 5-prime end of the gene has 77%
identity to the 5-prime end of the coding region of the rat POM121 gene,
which had been characterized as a nuclear pore membrane protein. The
3-prime end of POMZP3 is 99% identical to the last 4 exons of the zona
pellucida glycoprotein gene ZP3 (182889). POMZP3 is presumably the
result of partial duplication of the human POM121 homolog and ZP3.
Unlike the true ZP3 locus, which is transcribed exclusively in the
ovary, POMZP3 is expressed in a variety of tissues.

MAPPING

Kipersztok et al. (1995) mapped the POMZP3 gene by fluorescence in situ
hybridization to chromosome 7q11.2.

;;GTPase REGULATOR ASSOCIATED WITH FOCAL ADHESION KINASE; GRAF;;
KIAA0621
GRAF/MLL FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Borkhardt et al. (2000) stated that mutual translocations involving
11q23 in acute leukemias had been demonstrated to show fusion between
the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL; 159555) gene and a variety of different
partner genes to a total of 23. The detection of a unique
t(5;11)(q31;q23) in an infant with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia
(JMML; 607785) and an MLL gene rearrangement provided an opportunity to
clone another MLL fusion partner gene. By cloning the breakpoints in
this translocation, Borkhardt et al. (2000) recovered a member of the
GTPase-activating protein (GAP) family, which they identified as the
human homolog of the avian GRAF gene (Hildebrand et al., 1996).

Ishikawa et al. (1998) cloned a GRAF cDNA, which they designated
KIAA0621, from a human brain cDNA library and found that it encodes a
deduced 753-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 87 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Hildebrand et al. (1996) determined that the GRAF gene is highly
homologous to the BCR gene (151410), which is also involved in a
leukemia-associated translocation. The avian GRAF protein binds to the
C-terminal domain of pp125(FAK), one of the tyrosine kinases predicted
to be a critical component of the integrin signaling transduction
pathway, in an SH3 domain-dependent manner and stimulates the GTPase
activity of the GTP-binding protein RhoA. Thus, GRAF acts as a negative
regulator of RhoA.

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis, in vitro binding assays, and
immunoprecipitation analysis, Shibata et al. (2001) showed that PKN-beta
(PKN3; 610714) interacted with GRAF and GRAF2 (ARHGAP10; 609746). A
constitutively active form of PKN-beta phosphorylated recombinant GRAF
and GRAF2. Mutation analysis showed that the linker region of PKN-beta
bound to the SH3 domains of GRAF and GRAF2.

MAPPING

Ishikawa et al. (1998) mapped the GRAF gene to chromosome 5. Borkhardt
et al. (2000) found that the GRAF gene maps outside the 5q31 region that
is commonly deleted in hematologic malignancies; however, inactivation
of both alleles in at least some cases suggests that deletions and
mutations of the GRAF gene may be instrumental in the development and
progression of hematologic disorders with a del(5q). By FISH, Borkhardt
et al. (2000) confirmed the assignment of GRAF to 5q31.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Borkhardt et al. (2000) sequenced several cDNA clones from 13 cases of
hematologic malignancy in which 1 allele of GRAF was deleted. In 1
patient with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML; 607785), they found
a point mutation within the GAP domain of the second GRAF allele
(605370.0001). In 2 additional patients, they found an insertion of 52
or 74 bp within the GRAF cDNA, which generated a reading frameshift
followed by a premature stop codon (605370.0002-605370.0003). The
mutations were apparently somatic events.

In a leukemic cells derived from a patient with juvenile myelomonocytic
leukemia (JMML; 607785) and a fusion between the MLL gene on 11q and the
GRAF gene on 5q, Borkhardt et al. (2000) identified in the other GRAF
allele an A-to-G transition at nucleotide 1255 that resulted in the
substitution of a serine for an asparagine at amino acid 417. This was
thought to be a second hit in a leukemogenic process.

In leukemic cells from a patient with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia
(JMML; 607785) and a reciprocal translocation t(5;11)(q31;q23) involving
the GRAF and MLL genes, Borkhardt et al. (2000) found that the other
allele of the GRAF gene carried a 52-bp insertion at the splice junction
of exons 12 and 13. The exon/intron boundary was located at nucleotides
1290/91. The insertion led to a reading frameshift that generated a stop
codon. The predicted truncated GRAF protein lacked almost the entire GAP
domain and therefore was most likely not functional. The 52-bp insertion
(nucleotides 32560-32611) originated from a 524-bp long sequence located
upstream of the 3-prime splice site of the adjacent nearly 13-kb long
intron. Because the insertion is imbedded in perfect splice donor and
acceptor sites, it was thought to be the result of aberrant splicing.

In leukemic cells from a patient with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia
(JMML; 607785) and a t(5;11)(q31;q23) involving the N-terminal part of
MLL and the C-terminal part of the GRAF gene, Borkhardt et al. (2000)
found that the GRAF allele on the other chromosome 5 carried a 74-bp
insertion located in the 60-kb long intron between exons 15 and 16. The
insertion presumably generated a stop codon. The predicted protein
lacked the SH3 domain of GRAF that was shown to be necessary for the
interaction with the focal adhesion kinase.

;;ERD2, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; ERD2;;
HDEL RECEPTOR, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Resident soluble proteins within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) are retained there by virtue of a C-terminal tetrapeptide ER
retention signal, commonly lys-asp-glu-leu (KDEL) in mammals. KDELR1
cycles between the Golgi apparatus and the ER, returning proteins
containing the KDEL signal to the ER (Lewis and Pelham, 1992).

CLONING

By PCR of a T-cell cDNA library using degenerate primers based on yeast
ERD2, followed by screening a placenta cDNA library, Lewis and Pelham
(1990) cloned KDELR1. The deduced 212-amino acid protein has 7
hydrophobic regions and shares 50% identity with the yeast receptor.
Following expression in COS cells, epitope tagged KDELR1 concentrated in
the Golgi apparatus and in punctate structures that may have been
transport vesicles or functional intermediates between the ER and Golgi.

GENE FUNCTION

Lewis and Pelham (1992) found that overexpression of human ERD2 improved
the retention of a protein with a weakly recognized variant of the KDEL
retention signal, DDEL. Overexpression of KDEL or DDEL ligands caused
redistribution of ERD2 from the Golgi apparatus to the ER, and mutation
of ERD2 altered the ligand specificity of this redistribution. The
authors concluded that ligand control of receptor movement may limit
retrograde flow and minimize fruitless recycling of secretory proteins.

Hsu et al. (1992) found that about half of KDELR1- or KDELR2
(609024)-transfected COS cells expressed the receptors in a
juxtanuclear, Golgi-like pattern, while the remainder showed a
reticular, ER-like pattern with nuclear envelope staining.
Overexpression of the KDEL receptors led to the ER-like pattern and was
associated with the collapse of the Golgi apparatus into the ER, as seen
in cells treated with brefeldin A. In addition to the loss of the Golgi
apparatus as a distinct organelle, overexpression resulted in
redistribution of the Golgi coat protein, beta-COP (COPB; 600959), to
the cytosol, addition of complex oligosaccharides to resident ER
glycoproteins, and blockage of anterograde traffic. Hsu et al. (1992)
concluded that the KDEL receptors provide signals that regulate
retrograde traffic between the Golgi and the ER.

Townsley et al. (1993) expressed mutant forms of KDELR1 in COS cells and
examined their intracellular locations and ligand-binding capacities.
They found that ligand binding was dependent on charged residues within
the transmembrane domains. Retrograde transport of occupied receptors
was unaffected by most mutations in the cytoplasmic loops, but was
critically dependent upon asp193 in transmembrane domain 7. Retention in
the Golgi apparatus required neither ligand binding nor asp193. Townsley
et al. (1993) concluded that movement of the receptor is controlled by
conformational changes and intermolecular interactions within the
membrane bilayer.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Smith et al. (2000) mapped the KDELR1 gene
to chromosome 19q13.3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hamada et al. (2004) created transgenic mice expressing a
transport-defective human KDEL receptor. The mutant receptor sensitized
cells to ER stress, and mutant mice developed dilated cardiomyopathy.
Ultrastructural analysis revealed expanded sarcoplasmic reticulums and
protein aggregates that obstructed the adjacent transverse tubules of
mutant cardiomyocytes. Mutant cardiomyocytes were sensitive to ER stress
following treatment with an N-glycosylation inhibitor, and they showed a
functional defect in the L-type Ca(2+) current. The authors observed
ubiquitinated protein aggregates, enhanced expression of Chop (126337),
a death-related transcriptional factor expressed upon ER stress, and
apoptosis in the mutant hearts. Hamada et al. (2004) concluded that
impairment of the KDEL receptor disturbed ER quality control, resulting
in accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER, and that the dilated
cardiomyopathy in transgenic mice was associated with ER stress.

;;MITOCHONDRIAL TRANSLATION ELONGATION FACTOR Tu;;
EF-Tu, MITOCHONDRIAL;;
EF-TuMT
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Mitochondrial elongation factor Tu (EF-TuMT, or TUFM) is encoded in the
nucleus and functions in the translational apparatus of mitochondria.
Ling et al. (1997) determined the complete human TUFM cDNA sequence of
1,677 bp, including a 101-bp 5-prime untranslated region and a 207-bp
3-prime untranslated region. The predicted protein is approximately 49.8
kD and is composed of 455 amino acids, with a putative N-terminal
mitochondrial leader sequence of approximately 50 amino acids. The
predicted amino acid sequence shows high similarity to other EF-Tu
protein sequences from yeast and bacteria. Northern blot analysis
detected an approximately 1.7-kb TUFM transcript in human liver.

GENE FUNCTION

Mitochondrial nucleoids are large complexes containing, on average, 5 to
7 mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genomes and several proteins involved in
mtDNA replication and transcription, as well as related processes.
Bogenhagen et al. (2008) had previously shown that TUFM was associated
with native purified HeLa cell nucleoids. Using a formaldehyde
crosslinking technique, they found that TUFM copurified with mtDNA and
was a core nucleoid protein.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ling et al. (1997) determined that the TUFM gene contains 10 exons and
spans approximately 3.6 kb.

MAPPING

Ling et al. (1997) assigned the TUFM gene to 16p11.2 by isotopic in situ
hybridization and by PCR analysis of somatic cell hybrid DNAs. In
addition, they identified and mapped an intronless pseudogene to
17q11.2. By somatic cell hybrid analysis and radiation hybrid mapping,
Shah et al. (1998) confirmed the assignment of the TUFM gene to 16p11.2.
They also localized a TUFM pseudogene to the centromeric region of
chromosome 17.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Schmeing et al. (2009) presented the crystal structure of the Thermus
thermophilus 70S ribosome complexed with EF-Tu and aminoacyl-tRNA,
refined to 3.6-angstrom resolution. The structure revealed details of
the tRNA distortion that allows aminoacyl-tRNA to interact
simultaneously with the decoding center of the 30S subunit and EF-Tu at
the factor-binding site. A series of conformational changes in EF-Tu and
aminoacyl-tRNA suggested a communication pathway between the decoding
center and the guanosine triphosphatase center of EF-Tu.

Voorhees et al. (2010) determined the crystal structure of elongation
factor Tu (EF-Tu) and aminoacyl tRNA bound to the ribosome with a GTP
analog to 3.2-angstrom resolution. EF-Tu is in its active conformation,
with the catalytic his84 coordinating the nucleophilic water in position
for inline attack on the gamma-phosphate of GTP. This activated
conformation is due to a critical and conserved interaction of his84
with A2662 of the sarcin-ricin loop of the 23S ribosomal RNA. Liljas et
al. (2011) commented on the paper of Voorhees et al. (2010), stating
that their identification of his84 of EF-Tu as deprotonating the
catalytic water molecule is problematic in relation to the atomic
structure, and suggested that the terminal phosphate of GTP is more
likely to be the proper proton acceptor. Voorhees et al. (2011) replied
that the experiments and model generated by Liljas et al. (2011) were
also problematic and suggested that further study is required to
definitively determine the mechanism of GTP hydrolysis by EF-Tu.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Mitochondrial protein translation is a complex process performed within
mitochondria by an apparatus composed of mtDNA-encoded RNAs and nuclear
DNA-encoded proteins. The vast majority of mitochondrial translation
defects in humans have been associated with mutations in RNA-encoding
mtDNA genes. Genetic investigation involving patients with defective
mitochondrial translation led Valente et al. (2007) to the discovery of
novel mutations in mitochondrial elongation factor G1 (EFG1; 606639) in
1 affected baby and, for the first time, in the mitochondrial elongation
factor Tu (TUFM) in another one. Both patients were affected by severe
lactic acidosis and rapidly progressive, fatal encephalopathy. The
EFG1-mutant patient had early-onset Leigh syndrome, whereas the
EF-Tu-mutant patient had severe infantile macrocystic leukodystrophy
with micropolygyria.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
COMBINED OXIDATIVE PHOSPHORYLATION DEFICIENCY 4
TUFM, ARG339GLN

In an Italian infant with combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency
(COXPD4; 610678), Valente et al. (2007) identified homozygous missense
mutation in the TUFM gene: a 1016G-A transition causing an arg339-to-gln
substitution (R339Q) in mitochondrial elongation factor Tu. The patient
had an extremely severe syndrome dominated by lactic acidosis and
rapidly fatal encephalopathy, with diffuse cystic leukodystrophy and
micropolygyria, a developmental abnormality of the brain that occurs
well before birth. Modest elevation of hepatic enzymes in blood and
episodic hyperammonemia indicated mild liver involvement that never
progressed to hepatic failure. Other tissues, notably the heart, were
clinically spared. The patient died at age 14 months.

600954	TITLE *600954 DEATH-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; DAP
DESCRIPTION Deiss et al. (1995) reported that gamma-interferon (147570) induced in
HeLa cells a type of death that had cytologic characteristics of
programmed cell death. In this system, they identified 2 novel genes
whose expression was indispensable for the execution of this type of
cell death. The rescue was based on positive growth selection of cells
after transfection with antisense cDNA expression libraries. The
antisense RNA-mediated inactivation of the 2 novel genes protected the
cells from the IFNG-induced cell death, but not from the cytostatic
effects of the cytokine or from a necrotic type of cell death. One of
these genes was death-associated protein kinase-1 (600831). The other,
designated death-associated protein (DAP), was expressed as a single
2.4-kb mRNA that encodes a basic, proline-rich, 15-kD protein. The
expression levels of the 2 proteins were selectively reduced by the
corresponding antisense RNAs. The authors suggested that these 2 novel
genes are candidates for positive mediators of programmed cell death
that is induced by interferon-gamma.

By analysis of rodent-human somatic cell hybrids, Feinstein et al.
(1995) found that DAP is located on chromosome 5p15.2 in a region just

601082	TITLE *601082 UBIQUITIN-CONJUGATING ENZYME E2H; UBE2H
;;UBIQUITIN-CONJUGATING ENZYME UBC8, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION Ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes catalyze the covalent attachment of
ubiquitin to cellular substrates. Kaiser et al. (1994) isolated a novel
ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme from human placenta and cloned the
corresponding cDNA. DNA sequencing revealed that this gene, symbolized
UBCH2 by them, encodes a protein with significant sequence similarity to
yeast UBC8. They discovered that yeast UBC8 is interrupted by a single
intron bearing an unusual branch point sequence. The authors noted that
yeast UBC8 exhibited 54% amino acid sequence identity to human UBCH2.
Moreover, full-length yeast and human enzymes expressed from the cDNAs
showed similar enzymatic activities in vitro by catalyzing the
ubiquitination of histones, suggesting that the 2 enzymes may fulfill
similar functions in vivo.

By study of hamster/human hybrid cell DNAs, Kaiser et al. (1994)
demonstrated that the human UBC8 gene is located on chromosome 7.
Hayashida et al. (2000) constructed a 1-Mb physical and transcript map
of 7q32 and mapped UBE2H to a region between D7S530 and D7S649.

615321	TITLE *615321 CHLORIDE INTRACELLULAR CHANNEL 6; CLIC6
;;CLIC1-LIKE; CLIC1L;;
PARCHORIN, RABBIT, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

At its C-terminal end, CLIC6 shares significant similarity with chloride
intracellular channels (CLICs; see 602872). However, CLIC6 has a long
N-terminal domain that is absent in other CLIC proteins (Friedli et al.,
2003).

CLONING

By RT-PCR, EST sequencing, and screening a heart cDNA library, Friedli
et al. (2003) obtained 2 splice variants of human CLIC6. The full-length
variant encodes a deduced 704-amino acid protein with a long N-terminal
domain, followed by 5 CLIC signature motifs and a transmembrane domain.
The N-terminal domain contains a 10-amino acid motif (consensus
AEGPAGDSVD) repeated 14 times. The shorter CLIC6 variant lacks exon 2
and encodes a deduced 687-amino acid protein. Friedli et al. (2003) also
cloned mouse Clic6, which lacks exon 2 and has significant differences
with exon 1 compared with human CLIC6. Exons 3 through 7 of human and
mouse CLIC6 encode sequences with 95% amino acid identity, but the
proteins share only 56% identity if exon 1 is included. The deduced
mouse protein contains only 1 motif similar to the 14 repeats found in
human CLIC6. In contrast, the rabbit ortholog of CLIC6, parchorin, has
an N-terminal repeat region similar to that of human CLIC6. RT-PCR and
Northern blot analyses of human tissues detected CLIC6 transcripts of
about 5 kb in lung and stomach and of about 6 kb in heart and muscle. In
mouse, Clic6 was expressed in brain, stomach, lung, kidney, testis, eye,
and day-9.5 mouse embryo.

GENE STRUCTURE

Friedli et al. (2003) determined that the CLIC6 gene contains 7 exons
and spans 48.8 kb. Exon 1 contains a 408-nucleotide segment that is GC
rich (76%), and exon 2 is alternatively spliced.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Friedli et al. (2003) mapped the CLIC6
gene to chromosome 21q22.12, between the RCAN1 gene (602917) and the
RUNX1 gene (151385).

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The beta and gamma crystallins are evolutionarily related families of
proteins that make up a large part of the refractive structure of the
eye lens. The gamma-N crystallins have a hybrid gene structure, half
beta and half gamma. By searching genome databases for sequences similar
to rodent Crygn, Wistow et al. (2005) identified the human CRYGN gene,
but it appeared to have undergone major evolutionary changes. PCR and
EST database analysis revealed possible CRYGN transcripts in human
retinal pigment epithelium, hippocampus, and testis, but they were
unlike the transcripts expressed in rodents and did not appear to be
translated.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Wistow et al. (2005) mapped the CRYGN gene
to chromosome 7q36.1.

;;GERM CELL NUCLEAR FACTOR; GCNF;;
RETINOID RECEPTOR-RELATED TESTIS-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR; RTR
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The nuclear receptor gene superfamily of ligand-activated transcription
factors is involved in the regulation of development, growth, and
reproduction. Agoulnik et al. (1998) cloned a cDNA for a new orphan
nuclear receptor, termed germ cell nuclear factor (GCNF), by screening a
human testis cDNA library with a mouse Gcnf probe. The full-length GCNF
cDNA encodes a predicted 454-amino acid polypeptide with a molecular
weight of 52 kD. Mouse Gcnf is expressed primarily in germ cells in the
adult (Chen et al., 1994). By Northern blot analysis and in situ
hybridization studies, Agoulnik et al. (1998) found that human GCNF is
expressed at high levels only in the testis, with expression restricted
to germ cells, the spermatids and late-stage spermatocytes. Southern
blot analysis indicated that GCNF is a single-copy gene. Agoulnik et al.
(1998) stated that 4 reported isoforms of GCNF provide evidence for
alternative exon splicing in the N-terminal part of the gene.

Kapelle et al. (1997), Lei et al. (1997), and Susens and Borgmeyer
(1996) also isolated cDNAs encoding human GCNF, or RTR (retinoid
receptor-related testis-associated receptor). Using Northern blot
analysis, Lei et al. (1997) and Susens and Borgmeyer (1996) found that
GCNF is expressed as approximately 7.5- and 2.2-kb transcripts primarily
in testis. Low levels of the larger mRNA were observed in various other
tissues. Lei et al. (1997) reported that GCNF contains the 2 zinc finger
motifs and putative ligand-binding domain characteristic of the nuclear
hormone receptor superfamily. The amino acid sequences of mouse and
human GCNF are 99% identical.

MAPPING

Using a somatic cell hybrid panel, Lei et al. (1997) mapped the NR6A1
gene to chromosome 9. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Agoulnik et
al. (1998) mapped the NR6A1 gene to 9q33-q34.1.

609713	TITLE *609713 HYDROXYUREA-SENSITIVE 1, S. POMBE, HOMOLOG OF, B; HUS1B
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database searching, Hang et al. (2002) identified HUS1B, a novel
paralog of the human cell cycle checkpoint gene HUS1 (603760). HUS1B
encodes a 278-amino acid protein that is 48% identical to the HUS1
protein. Hang et al. (2002) also identified mouse and rat orthologs of
HUS1B. Northern blot analysis showed that expression of HUS1B in human
tissues parallels that of HUS1. A 1.4-kb HUS1B transcript was observed
in all tissues tested and an additional 1-kb band was observed in testis
and prostate. Total HUS1B expression was highest in testis.

GENE FUNCTION

A HUS1-RAD1 (603153)-RAD9 (603761) protein complex is thought to form a
proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA; 176740)-like structure that is
important for cell cycle checkpoint function. Using a yeast 2-hybrid
analysis, Hang et al. (2002) showed that whereas HUS1 can bind RAD1,
RAD9, and another molecule of HUS1, HUS1B directly interacts with RAD1
but not with RAD9 or HUS1, suggesting that HUS1B cannot simply
substitute for HUS1 in the protein complex. Overexpression of HUS1B but
not HUS1 in human 293T cells led to clonogenic cell death. Hang et al.
(2002) suggested that HUS1B and HUS1 have distinct but related roles in
regulating cell cycle checkpoints and genomic integrity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hang et al. (2002) determined that the HUS1B gene is intronless.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Hang et al. (2002) mapped the HUS1B gene to
chromosome 6p25.3-p25.1.

602448	TITLE *602448 MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE KINASE KINASE 5; MAP3K5
;;MAP/ERK KINASE KINASE 5; MEKK5;;
MAPKKK5;;
APOPTOSIS SIGNAL-REGULATING KINASE 1; ASK1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades include MAPK
or extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), MAPK kinase (MAP2K, also
called MKK or MEK), and MAPK kinase kinase (MAP3K, also called MAPKKK or
MEKK). MAPKK kinase/MEKK, such as MAP3K5, phosphorylates and activates
its downstream protein kinase, MAPK kinase/MEK, which in turn activates
MAPK. The kinases of these signaling cascades are highly conserved, and
homologs exist in yeast, Drosophila, and mammalian cells (Wang et al.,
1996).

CLONING

Wang et al. (1996) used a degenerate polymerase chain reaction-based
strategy to isolate a cDNA encoding a protein kinase, designated
MAPKKK5, from a human macrophage library. The predicted protein contains
1,374 amino acids with all 11 kinase subdomains. Northern blot analysis
shows that MAPKKK5 transcript is abundantly expressed in human heart and
pancreas.

Ichijo et al. (1997) used a similar cloning strategy to identify a
nearly identical MAPKKK cDNA, termed ASK1 for apoptosis
signal-regulating kinase. The deduced protein contains 1,375 amino
acids, and is most closely related to yeast SSK2 and SSK22, which are
upstream regulators of yeast HOG1 MAPK.

GENE FUNCTION

Wang et al. (1996) showed that the MAPKKK5 protein phosphorylated and
activated MKK4 (601335) in vitro and activated c-jun N-terminal kinase
(JNK)/stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK; 601158) during transient
expression in COS and 293 cells; MAPKKK5 did not activate MAPK/ERK.

Ichijo et al. (1997) found that ASK1 expression complemented a yeast
mutant lacking functional SSK2 and SSK22. ASK1 also activated MKK3
(602315), MKK4 (SEK1), and MKK6 (601254). Overexpression of ASK1 induced
apoptotic cell death, and ASK1 was activated in cells treated with tumor
necrosis factor-alpha (TNFA; 191160).

Nishitoh et al. (1998) showed that ASK1 interacts with members of the
TRAF family and is activated by TRAF2 (601895) in the TNF-signaling
pathway. After activation by TRAF2, ASK1 activates MKK4, which in turn
activates JNK. Thus, ASK1 is a mediator of TRAF2-induced JNK activation.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a human brain cDNA library, Saitoh et al.
(1998) identified thioredoxin (TXN; 187700) and ASK1 as interacting
partners. TXN associated with the N-terminal portion of ASK1 in vitro
and in vivo, and the interaction between TXN and ASK1 was highly
dependent on the redox status of TXN. Expression of TXN inhibited ASK1
kinase activity and ASK1-dependent apoptosis. Inhibition of TXN resulted
in activation of endogenous ASK1 activity. Saitoh et al. (1998)
concluded that TXN is a physiologic inhibitor of ASK1 and may be
involved in redox regulation of the apoptosis signal transduction
pathway.

A virulence factor from Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, YopJ, is a 33-kD
protein that perturbs a multiplicity of signaling pathways. These
include inhibition of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase ERK
(600997), c-jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK; see 601158), and p38
mitogen-activated protein kinase (600289) pathways and inhibition of the
nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa-B; see 164011) pathway. The expression
of YopJ has been correlated with the induction of apoptosis by Yersinia.
Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen based on a LexA-YopJ fusion protein and a
HeLa cDNA library, Orth et al. (1999) identified mammalian binding
partners of YopJ. These included the fusion proteins of the GAL4
activation domain with MAPK kinases MKK1 (176872), MKK2 (601263), and
MKK4/SEK1 (601335). YopJ was found to bind directly to MKKs in vitro,
including MKK1, MKK3 (602315), MKK4, and MKK5. Binding of YopJ to the
MKK blocked both phosphorylation and subsequent activation of the MKKs.
These results explain the diverse activities of YopJ in inhibiting the
ERK, JNK, p38, and NF-kappa-B signaling pathways, preventing cytokine
synthesis and promoting apoptosis. YopJ-related proteins that are found
in a number of bacterial pathogens of animals and plants may function to
block MKKs so that host signaling responses can be modulated upon
infection.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen, McDonald et al. (2000) identified JNK3
(602897) as a binding partner of beta-arrestin-2 (ARBB2; 107941). These
results were confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation from mouse brain
extracts and cotransfection in COS-7 cells. The upstream JNK activators
ASK1 and MKK4 (601335) were also found in complex with ARBB2. Cellular
transfection of ARBB2 caused cytosolic retention of JNK3 and enhanced
JNK3 phosphorylation stimulated by ASK1. Moreover, stimulation of the
angiotensin II type 1A receptor (AGTR1; 106165) activated JNK3 and
triggered the colocalization of ARBB2 and active JNK3 to intracellular
vesicles. Thus, McDonald et al. (2000) concluded that ARBB2 acts as a
scaffold protein, which brings the spatial distribution and activity of
this MAPK module under the control of a G protein-coupled receptor.

The HIV-1 Nef protein induces the expression of FAS ligand (TNFSF6;
134638) on infected cells, thereby inducing apoptosis in neighboring
cells, including HIV-1 specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (Xu et al.,
1997). By capturing cellular proteins interacting with a GST fusion
protein containing HIV-1 Nef, followed by micropeptide sequence and
immunoblot analyses, Geleziunas et al. (2001) identified a 160-kD
protein identical to ASK1. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that Nef
interacts with ASK1 but not MAP3K3 (602539). Transfection and
immunoprecipitation analyses indicated that wildtype, but not an
N-terminal myristylation or an R106A mutant, Nef inhibits ASK1-, FAS-
(134637), and TNFA-induced, but not MAP3K1- 600982 induced, activation
of JNK-mediated apoptosis. Nef inhibits TNFA-induced dissociation of
ASK1 from TXN, an inhibitor of ASK1 catalytic activity. Infection with
ASK1-binding wildtype, but not ASK1-binding R106A Nef mutant, HIV
strains also inhibited TNFA- and anti-FAS-induced apoptosis. Immunoblot
analysis showed that only wildtype Nef inhibited the expression of the
catalytic, apoptosis-inducing form of ASK1. Geleziunas et al. (2001)
concluded that HIV-1 Nef enhances the resistance of infected cells to
FAS- and TNFA-induced apoptosis, allowing host cells to survive and
produce new infectious virions, by mimicking the action of TXN or 14-3-3
proteins (see YWHAE, 605066) in preventing ASK1 activation.

Using immunoprecipitation-kinase analysis, Chang et al. (1998) showed
that activity of ASK1, but not of TAK1 (MAP3K7; 602614) or an ASK1
lys709-to-arg mutant, is potentiated by coexpression with DAXX (603186)
or the JNK activation domain (amino acids 501 to 625) of DAXX. FAS
activation was found to enhance endogenous ASK1 activity. Yeast 2-hybrid
analysis established that ASK1 interacts directly with DAXX but not FAS,
indicating that DAXX acts as a bridge between FAS and ASK1. Chang et al.
(1998) concluded that the DAXX-ASK1 connection provides a mechanism for
caspase-independent activation of JNK by FAS and perhaps other stimuli.

Raoul et al. (2002) showed that Fas triggers cell death specifically in
motor neurons by transcriptional upregulation of neuronal nitric oxide
synthase (nNOS; 163731) mediated by p38 kinase. ASK1 and Daxx act
upstream of p38 in the Fas signaling pathway. The authors also showed
that synergistic activation of the NO pathway and the classic FADD
(602457)/caspase-8 (601763) pathway were needed for motor neuron cell
death. No evidence for involvement of the Fas/NO pathway was found in
other cell types. Motor neurons from transgenic mice expressing
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS; 105400)-linked SOD1 (147450)
mutations displayed increased susceptibility to activation of the Fas/NO
pathway. Raoul et al. (2002) emphasized that this signaling pathway was
unique to motor neurons and suggested that these cell death pathways may
contribute to motor neuron loss in ALS.

Saito et al. (2007) found that expression of mouse Pp2ce (PPM1L; 611931)
in HEK293 human embryonic kidney cells inhibited Ask1-induced activation
of an AP1 (165160) reporter gene. Conversely, a dominant-negative Pp2ce
mutant enhanced AP1 activity. Mouse Pp2ce and Ask1 interacted in HEK293
cells under nonstressed conditions, and Pp2ce inactivated Ask1 by
decreasing thr845 phosphorylation in the cell system and also in vitro.
The association of Pp2ce and Ask1 was also observed in mouse brain
extracts. In contrast with PP5 (PPP5C; 600658), Pp2ce transiently
dissociated from Ask1 within cells upon peroxide treatment. Saito et al.
(2007) concluded that PP2CE maintains ASK1 in an inactive state by
dephosphorylation in quiescent cells.

Takeda et al. (2009) found that PGAM5 (614939) interacted with and
activated ASK1 by threonine dephosphorylation, resulting in downstream
activation of JNK and p38. Overexpression and knockdown studies revealed
that the Drosophila and C. elegans orthologs of PGAM5 also exhibited
specific ser/thr phosphatase activity and activated the Drosophila and
C. elegans orthologs of ASK1.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid mapping, Rampoldi et al. (1997) localized the MAP3K5
gene to chromosome 6q22.33.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Stark et al. (2012) sequenced 8 melanoma exomes to identify new somatic
mutations in metastatic melanoma. Focusing on the mitogen-activated
protein (MAP) kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) family, Stark et al. (2012)
found that 24% of melanoma cell lines have mutations in the
protein-coding regions of either MAP3K5 or MAP3K9 (600136). Structural
modeling predicted that mutations in the kinase domain may affect the
activity and regulation of these protein kinases. The position of the
mutations and the loss of heterozygosity of MAP3K5 and MAP3K9 in 85% and
67% of melanoma samples, respectively, together suggested that the
mutations are likely to be inactivating. In in vitro kinase assays,
MAP3K5 I780F and MAP3K9 W33X variants had reduced kinase activity.
Overexpression of MAP3K5 or MAP3K9 mutants in HEK293T cells reduced the
phosphorylation of downstream MAP kinases. Attenuation of MAP3K9
function in melanoma cells using siRNA led to increased cell viability
after temozolomide treatment, suggesting that decreased MAP3K pathway
activity can lead to chemoresistance in melanoma.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using a forward genetic screen of C. elegans mutants, Kim et al. (2002)
showed that viable worms lacking esp2 and esp8, homologs of the
mammalian MAP kinases SEK1 and ASK1, were highly susceptible to and died
more rapidly from both a gram-negative bacterium, P. aeruginosa, and a
gram-positive organism, E. faecalis, than wildtype worms.
RNA-interference and biochemical analyses likewise implicated the p38
MAP kinase homolog, pmk1, in susceptibility to these pathogens. Kim et
al. (2002) concluded that MAP kinase signaling, which is also involved
in plant pathogen resistance, is a conserved element in innate metazoan
immunity to diverse pathogens.

Left ventricular (LV) cardiac remodeling that occurs after myocardial
infarction and pressure overload is generally accepted as a determinant
of the clinical course of heart failure, and it has been suggested that
the remodeling is associated with increased apoptosis in the myocardium.
In mouse models of LV remodeling induced by left coronary artery
ligation or pressure overload, Yamaguchi et al. (2003) found that Ask1
knockout mice had significantly smaller increases in LV dimensions and
smaller decreases in fractional shortening compared with wildtype mice,
as well as a reduction in apoptotic cardiac myocytes. In the wildtype
hearts, there was a significant increase in Ask1 activity, accompanied
by an increase in Jnk (MAPK8; 601158) phosphorylation. The authors
concluded that ASK1 plays a critical role in the stress-induced
apoptotic pathway in LV remodeling.

In male Sprague-Dawley rats, Izumi et al. (2003) observed a rapid and
dramatic increase in arterial Ask1 activity after balloon injury. Gene
transfer of a dominant-negative mutant of Ask1 significantly prevented
neointimal formation at 14 days after injury; bromodeoxyuridine labeling
revealed that dominant-negative Ask1 suppressed vascular smooth muscle
cell (VSMC) proliferation in both the intima and media at 7 days.
Infection of cultured rat VSMCs with dominant-negative Ask1
significantly attenuated serum-induced VSMC proliferation and migration.
In Ask1-null mice, there was attenuation both of neointimal formation
after cuff injury and of proliferation and migration of VSMCs compared
to wildtype mice. Izumi et al. (2003) concluded that ASK1 activation
plays a key role in vascular intimal hyperplasia.

606272	TITLE *606272 CYSTINOSIN; CTNS
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Town et al. (1998) identified a novel gene, CTNS, within the deletion
interval on chromosome 17 in patients with nephropathic cystinosis
(219800). They found that CTNS encodes an integral membrane protein,
which they designated cystinosin, that has features of a lysosomal
membrane protein. CTNS, a putative cystine transporter, contains 367
amino acids and 7 transmembrane domains. A 2.7-kb transcript of the CTNS
gene was strongly expressed in pancreas, kidney (mature and fetal),
skeletal muscle, to a lesser extent in placenta and heart, and weakly in
lung and liver.

GENE STRUCTURE

Town et al. (1998) determined that the CTNS gene has 12 exons.
Phornphutkul et al. (2001) identified the CTNS promoter as the region
encompassing nucleotides -316 to +1 with respect to the transcription
start site. This region contains an Sp-1 regulatory element at positions
-299 to -293 which, as shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assays,
binds Sp-1. The CTNS promoter region shares 41 nucleotides with the
promoter region of an adjacent gene, CARKL (SHPK; 605060), whose start
site is 501 bp from the CTNS start site. CARKL is aligned on the other
DNA strand in the other direction.

MAPPING

Town et al. (1998) found that the marker locus D17S829 was homozygously
deleted in 23 of 70 patients with nephropathic cystinosis and mapped a
novel gene, CTNS, to the deletion interval.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Town et al. (1998) identified 11 different mutations in the CTNS gene
(see, e.g., 606272.0001-606272.0005), all predicted to cause loss of
function of the protein, segregating with nephropathic cystinosis. The
most common mutation was a 65-kb deletion (606272.0005), found in 23
(33%) of 70 patients.

Shotelersuk et al. (1998) performed mutation analysis of 108
American-based nephropathic cystinosis patients and found that 48 (44%)
were homozygous for the 'European' 65-kb deletion, 2 had a smaller major
deletion, 11 were homozygous and 3 were heterozygous for 753G-A (W138X;
606272.0003), and 24 had 21 other mutations. In 20 patients (19%), no
mutations were found. Of 82 alleles bearing the 65-kb deletion, 38
derived from Germany, 28 from the British Isles, and 4 from Iceland. The
18 new mutations identified in this study included the first reported
missense mutation, 2 in-frame deletions, and mutations in patients of
African American, Mexican, and Indian ancestry. CTNS mutations were
spread throughout the leader sequence, transmembrane, and
nontransmembrane regions. According to a cystinosis clinical severity
score, homozygotes for the 65-kb deletion and for W138X had average
disease, whereas mutations involving the first amino acids prior to
transmembrane domains were associated with mild disease. By Northern
blot analysis, CTNS was not expressed in patients homozygous for the
65-kb deletion but was expressed in all 15 other patients tested.

Structure predictions suggested that cystinosin is a novel integral
lysosomal membrane protein. Attard et al. (1999) examined the predicted
effects of mutations on this model of cystinosin. They screened patients
with infantile nephropathic cystinosis, those with late-onset
cystinosis, and patients whose phenotype did not fit the classic
definitions. They identified 23 different mutations in the CTNS gene, 14
of which were novel. Of 25 patients with infantile nephropathic
cystinosis, 12 had 2 severely truncating mutations, consistent with a
loss of functional protein, and 13 had missense or in-frame deletions,
which would result in disruption of transmembrane domains and loss of
protein function. Mutations identified in 2 late-onset patients (see,
e.g., 606272.0008) affected functionally unimportant regions of
cystinosin, accounting for the patients' milder phenotype. For 3
patients, the age of onset of cystinosis was under 7 years, but the
course of the disease was milder than the infantile nephropathic form.
This suggested that the missense mutations identified in these
individuals (see, e.g., 606272.0007) allowed production of a functional
protein and may also indicate regions of cystinosin that are not
functionally important.

As indicated earlier, identification of the CTNS gene was facilitated by
the detection of deletions spanning the cystinosis locus in affected
individuals. Two types of deletions were detected, one of approximately
65 kb, which was found in homozygous state in nearly one-third of
cystinotic individuals, and a smaller one of 9.5 to 16 kb, which was
carried by a single family. Both the larger and the smaller deletion
span the 5-prime end of the CTNS gene, covering exons 1 to 10 and 1 to
3, respectively; STS analysis indicated that the larger deletion was the
same size in all patients. Forestier et al. (1999) characterized the
deletion breakpoints and demonstrated that, although both deletions
occur in regions of repetitive sequences, they are the result of
nonhomologous recombination. This type of mechanism suggested that the
deletion of approximately 65 kb is not a recurrent mutation, and the
results confirmed that it is identical in all patients. Haplotype
analysis showed that this large deletion is due to a founder effect that
occurred in a white individual, and that it probably arose in the middle
of the first millennium. Forestier et al. (1999) also described a rapid
PCR-based assay that will accurately detect both homozygous and
heterozygous deletions. They used this assay to show that the 65-kb
deletion is present in either the homozygous or the heterozygous state
in 76% of cystinotic patients of European origin.

Touchman et al. (2000) sequenced 200 kb surrounding the CTNS gene and
found that the common cystinosis deletion (606272.0005) is approximately
57 rather than 65 kb. The authors identified SHPK, which they designated
CARKL, within this deleted region. The findings indicated that patients
with the 57-kb deletion in CTNS also have a deletion of CARKL, which may
account for phenotypic variability.

Phornphutkul et al. (2001) identified mutations in the CTNS promoter
region in 3 patients with cystinosis (606272.0012-606272.0014). Each of
the promoter mutations drastically reduced CAT activity when inserted
into a reporter construct and failed either to cause a mobility shift
when exposed to nuclear extract or to compete with the normal
oligonucleotide's mobility shift. These mutations had no effect on
promoter activity of the CARKL gene.

Gahl et al. (2002) stated that more than 50 different CTNS mutations had
been described in homozygous form in cystinosis. The most common
mutation is the 57,257-bp deletion, which is found in homozygous state
in approximately 50% of cystinosis patients of northern European
descent. The deletion is an ancient founder mutation; more recent CTNS
mutations involve alterations in the promoter region, leader sequence,
transmembrane domains, or nontransmembrane regions. Mutations include
small deletions and insertions and nonsense, missense, and splicing
mutations.

Gahl et al. (2002) stated that patients with intermediate cystinosis
(219900) and patients with ocular, or nonnephropathic, cystinosis
(219750) generally have 1 severe CTNS mutation (e.g., the 57-kb deletion
or a nonsense mutation) and 1 mild mutation, so that part of the
transport function of cystinosin is retained. However, homozygosity for
a mutation of a conserved amino acid (N323K; 606272.0016) was observed
in 2 sibs in Taiwan with intermediate cystinosis (Thoene et al., 1999),
indicating presumably that the mutation allowed for some residual
cystine transport, accounting for the mild clinical presentation.

Mason et al. (2003) analyzed the CTNS gene in 42 Italian patients with
nephropathic cystinosis and found that the mutation spectrum in this
population differed from that previously reported for the northern
European population: the 57-kb deletion was present in a lower
percentage (17%) and splicing mutations represented 30% of the mutations
detected.

By screening for mutations in the CTNS exons and promoter region,
Kalatzis et al. (2002) identified 14 novel mutations associated with
cystinosis: 11 underlying infantile cystinosis, 2 juvenile cystinosis,
and 1 associated with an atypical form of the disease (606272.0017).
These mutations, all situated in the exons or immediately flanking
intronic sequences, comprised in-frame insertions and deletions, as well
as missense, nonsense, and putative splice site mutations. Since the
cloning of CTNS, the authors had screened for mutations in 108 affected
individuals, with a high mutation detection rate of 95.8%. The few
undetectable mutant alleles segregated mostly in the noninfantile forms,
suggesting that these individuals carried mutations either in the
introns or in unidentified regulatory sequences.

Kalatzis et al. (2004) studied the relationship between transport
activity and intracellular localization of cystinosin mutants and their
associated clinical phenotype. Thirty-one pathogenic mutations (24
missense mutations, 7 in-frame deletions or insertions) were analyzed.
Most of the mutations did not alter the lysosomal localization of
cystinosin, although 3 partially mislocalized the protein independently
of its C-terminal sorting motif, thus confirming the presence of an
additional sorting mechanism. Sixteen of 19 mutations associated with
infantile cystinosis abolished transport, whereas 3 of 5 mutations
associated with juvenile or ocular forms strongly reduced transport.
Five atypical, unclassified, or misclassified mutations could be
clarified using the transport data and additional genetic information.
The authors concluded that impaired transport is the most frequent cause
of pathogenicity, with infantile cystinosis generally resulting from a
total loss of activity.

Macias-Vidal et al. (2009) analyzed the CTNS gene in 32 unrelated
cystinosis patients, 27 Spanish and 5 Moroccan, and identified
homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in 28 of them; only 1
mutation was detected in 4 patients. All but 2 of the patients had the
infantile form of cystinosis and had truncating mutations or mutations
affecting conserved amino acids associated with transmembrane regions of
the protein. The 2 juvenile cystinosis patients were both compound
heterozygotes for a truncating mutation (606272.0004 and 606272.0005,
respectively) and a missense mutation (S139F; 606272.0018) in the CTNS
gene; the latter had previously been found in a patient with a
'nonclassic,' milder form of nephropathic cystinosis by Attard et al.
(1999), who suggested that the S139F mutation might allow production of
functional protein or be located in a region of cystinosin that was not
functionally important.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using a promoter trap approach, Cherqui et al. (2002) created mice
expressing a truncated cystinosin protein. In wildtype mice, cystinosin
localized to lysosomes and transported cystine at acidic pH, whereas the
truncated cystinosin mislocalized to the plasma membrane and lost its
cystine transport function. These Ctns -/- mice accumulated cystine in
all organs tested, and cystine crystals, pathognomonic for cystinosis,
were observed. Ctns -/- mice developed ocular changes similar to those
observed in affected individuals, bone defects, and behavioral
anomalies. However, Ctns -/- mice did not develop proximal tubulopathy
or renal failure. As in cystinosis patients, cysteamine administration
aided cystine clearance in Ctns -/- mice.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CYSTINOSIS, NEPHROPATHIC
CTNS, GLY95TER

In 2 inbred families from Pakistan, Town et al. (1998) found that
nephropathic cystinosis (219800)was associated with a gly95-to-ter
mutation in the CTNS gene. Analysis of 5 microsatellites covering a 4-cM
interval showed a common haplotype, suggesting that these families may
be related. The mutation was a G-to-T transversion at nucleotide 622,
which converted GGA (gly) to TGA (stop).

.0002
CYSTINOSIS, NEPHROPATHIC
CTNS, 2-BP DEL, 397TG

In 2 families from central France, Town et al. (1998) found that
nephropathic cystinosis (219800) was associated with hemizygosity for
the same 2-bp deletion of the CTNS gene: deletion of TG at 397/399
resulted in a stop codon at the site of the mutation. The 2 families
shared a common haplotype that segregated with the deletion. Deletion of
the second allele was present in affected members of each family.

.0003
CYSTINOSIS, NEPHROPATHIC
CTNS, TRP138TER

One family from Northern Ireland and one from Eire were found by Town et
al. (1998) to have the same mutation as the basis of nephropathic
cystinosis (219800): a TGG-to-TGA transition at nucleotide 753 resulting
in a trp138-to-ter nonsense mutation.

McGowan-Jordan et al. (1999) found the W138X mutation in 21/40 French
Canadian cystinosis chromosomes. In all cases the mutation was on a
distinctive haplotype. They found the same haplotype in 2 Irish families
with this mutation, supporting the hypothesis that Celtic chromosomes
represent an extensive portion of cystinosis chromosomes in French
Canada. The studies also suggested a frequently unrecognized
contribution from non-Gallic sources in the French Canadian population.

CTNS, 4-BP DEL, 18GACT

In 4 families from 3 different continents, Town et al. (1998) found that
nephropathic cystinosis (219800) was associated with deletion of 4
nucleotides, GACT, at nucleotide 357 of the CTNS gene. This resulted in
frameshift and a premature termination. The 4 families did not share a
common haplotype, indicating a recurrent mutation. Macias-Vidal et al.
(2009) noted that based on numbering from the ATG initiation codon the
deletion occurs at nucleotide 18.

In a Spanish patient with juvenile-onset nephropathic cystinosis
(219900), Macias-Vidal et al. (2009) identified compound heterozygosity
for a 416C-T transition in the CTNS gene, resulting in a ser139-to-phe
(S139F; 606272.0018) substitution, and the 4-bp deletion.

CTNS, 57-KB DEL

This common mutation in nephropathic cystinosis (219800) was originally
reported as a 65-kb deletion. Touchman et al. (2000) sequenced 200 kb
surrounding the CTNS gene and found that the deletion is approximately
57 rather than 65 kb. The authors identified SHPK (605060), which they
designated CARKL, within this deleted region. The findings indicated
that the 57-kb deletion includes deletion of CARKL in addition to CTNS,
which may account for phenotypic variability in patients.

In a French/British report (Town et al., 1998), 23 (33%) of 70 patients
with nephropathic cystinosis had a 65-kb deletion in the CTNS gene.
Among American-based patients studied by Shotelersuk et al. (1998), 48
(44%) of 108 were homozygous for the 65-kb 'European' deletion. Of 96
alleles from these patients, 82 were assigned a nation of origin; 38
(46%) derived from Germany and 28 (34%) arose from the British Isles.
Two apparently unrelated patients with homozygous deletions came from
Iceland. In addition to the 48 patients homozygous for the 65-kb
deletion, many of the patients may have a single copy of the deletion.
An upstream deletion breakpoint needed to be determined before a
PCR-based test of heterozygosity for the deletion could be developed.

Gahl et al. (2002) stated that the 57-kb deletion is found in the
homozygous state in approximately 50% of patients of northern European
descent who have cystinosis. This founder mutation, which removes the
first 10 exons of CTNS and eliminates expression of the protein,
apparently occurred in Germany in approximately 500 A.D. (Shotelersuk et
al., 1998) and spread by migration to other regions, including Iceland.

Bendavid et al. (2004) described a FISH method permitting cytogenetic
laboratories to test for the 57-kb deletion, which is found in
approximately 60% of patients with cystinosis in the United States and
northern Europe.

Wamelink et al. (2008) found that cystinosis patients homozygous for the
57-kb deletion had increased urinary sedoheptulose and erythritol
compared to patients with other CTNS mutations. Enzyme studies of
cultured fibroblasts revealed an 80% reduction in sedoheptulose
phosphorylating activity compared to cystinosis patients with other
mutations and controls. The findings indicated that the CARKL gene
encodes sedoheptulokinase, which functions in the pentose phosphate
pathway.

Compound Heterozygosity for the 57-kb Deletion

In a 38-year-old woman who presented with photophobia at 38 years of age
but had suffered chronic sensitivity to light (219750), Anikster et al.
(2000) identified compound heterozygosity for the 57-kb deletion and a
928G-A transition, resulting in a glycine to arginine substitution at
codon 197 (G197R; 606272.0011). Compound heterozygosity was also found
in 2 additional patients from the same family with ocular cystinosis.

In a Spanish patient with juvenile-onset nephropathic cystinosis
(219900), Macias-Vidal et al. (2009) identified compound heterozygosity
for a 416C-T transition in the CTNS gene, resulting in a ser139-to-phe
(S139F; 606272.0018) substitution, and the 57-kb deletion.

.0006
CYSTINOSIS, NEPHROPATHIC
CTNS, GLY169ASP

One of 7 missense mutations in the CTNS gene discovered by Shotelersuk
et al. (1998) in patients with nephropathic cystinosis (219800) was a
gly169-to-asp amino acid substitution. Significant CTNS expression was
associated with homozygosity of this mutation. All 7 missense mutations
gave rise to amino acid changes either inside a transmembrane domain or
in the first amino acid prior to a transmembrane domain.

.0007
CYSTINOSIS, ATYPICAL NEPHROPATHIC
CTNS, VAL42ILE

In 3 patients, Attard et al. (1999) found an atypical presentation of
cystinosis (see 219800). Although onset was less than 7 years of age,
the course was atypically mild. One of the 3 patients (L18) was
homozygous for a G-to-A transition in the CTNS gene, resulting in a
val42-to-ile substitution in the nonconserved region toward the N
terminus. This part of the protein is predicted to lie within the lumen
of the lysosome, and the mutation was adjacent to, but would not affect,
a potential N-glycosylation site. Thus, the location of the mutation was
consistent with a milder phenotype.

.0008
CYSTINOSIS, LATE-ONSET JUVENILE OR ADOLESCENT NEPHROPATHIC TYPE
CTNS, IVS7AS, C-G, -10

In a patient typical of late-onset cystinosis (219900), Attard et al.
(1999) identified an intronic mutation of the CTNS gene, a C-to-G
transversion at nucleotide 801 -10. This resulted in the formation of an
alternative splice site upstream of the normal site. Sequencing across
the exon 7-8 boundary in cDNA showed the homozygous insertion of 9
bases, which would result in the addition of 3 amino acids, pro-cys-ser,
at a point immediately adjacent to the second transmembrane domain.
Although this occurred in a conserved region, the first cytosolic domain
is very small (normally 4 amino acids) and consequently may not be
functionally important. The addition of the imino group of proline at
this point might be expected to cause disruption of the folding of the
polypeptide chain, but is unlikely to enter or interfere with the
transmembrane domain.

.0009
CYSTINOSIS, OCULAR NONNEPHROPATHIC
CTNS, IVS10AS, C-G, -3

In a 26-year-old male with ocular nonnephropathic cystinosis (219750),
Anikster et al. (2000) reported a C-to-G transversion at the -3 position
of the acceptor splice site of IVS10 of the CTNS gene. This mutation was
found in compound heterozygosity with a TCCTT deletion at nucleotide
545.

.0010
CYSTINOSIS, NEPHROPATHIC
CTNS, 5-BP DEL, NT545

Shotelersuk et al. (1998) identified a 5-bp deletion starting at
nucleotide 545 resulting in an I69R amino acid substitution and a stop
codon at position 73 of the CTNS gene in a patient with classic
cystinosis (219800).

.0011
CYSTINOSIS, OCULAR NONNEPHROPATHIC
CTNS, GLY197ARG

In a 38-year-old woman who presented with photophobia at 38 years of age
but had suffered chronic sensitivity to light (219750), Anikster et al.
(2000) identified a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 928, resulting in a
glycine to arginine substitution at codon 197 (G197R). The patient was
compound heterozygous for the 57-kb deletion (606272.0005). This
mutation was also found in 2 additional patients from the same family
with ocular cystinosis. Both patients were compound heterozygous for the
G197R mutation and the 57-kb deletion.

.0012
CYSTINOSIS, NEPHROPATHIC
CTNS, -295G-C

In a woman of Scottish-Irish and Puerto Rican descent with nephropathic
cystinosis (219800), Phornphutkul et al. (2001) identified
heterozygosity for a 57-kb deletion (606272.0005) and a promoter
mutation, a G-to-C change at nucleotide -295, involving the Sp-1
regulatory element, in the CTNS gene. The latter mutation was tested for
its effect on promoter activity by generation of a -348 to +1 CTNS-CAT
construct and was found to produce 19% of the wildtype CAT activity when

CYSTINOSIS, OCULAR NONNEPHROPATHIC
CTNS, -303G-T

In a girl of German/Norwegian heritage with ocular cystinosis (219750),
Phornphutkul et al. (2001) identified heterozygosity for a G197R
mutation (606272.0011) and a promoter mutation, a G-to-T transversion at
nucleotide -303, in the CTNS gene. The latter mutation was tested for
its effect on promoter activity by generation of a -348 to +1 CTNS-CAT
construct and was found to produce 5% of the wildtype CAT activity when
transfected in HeLa cells.

CYSTINOSIS, OCULAR NONNEPHROPATHIC
CTNS, 1-BP INS, -303T

In a woman with ocular cystinosis (219750) reported by Anikster et al.
(2000), Phornphutkul et al. (2001) identified heterozygosity for a G197R
mutation (606272.0011) and a promoter mutation, insertion of a T after
position -303, in the CTNS gene. The latter mutation was tested for its
effect on promoter activity by generation of a -348 to +1 CTNS-CAT
construct and was found to produce 16% of the wildtype CAT activity when
transfected in HeLa cells.

CYSTINOSIS, NEPHROPATHIC
CTNS, GLY339ARG

In 4 children with nephropathic cystinosis (219800) in the Old Order
Amish population in southwestern Ohio, Rupar et al. (2001) identified a
G-to-A transition at nucleotide 1354. This transition resulted in a
glycine-to-arginine substitution at residue 339 (G339R). It was found in
homozygous form in affected children and in heterozygous form in an
unaffected sib.

.0016
CYSTINOSIS, LATE-ONSET JUVENILE OR ADOLESCENT NEPHROPATHIC TYPE
CTNS, ASN323LYS

Thoene et al. (1999) described 2 sibs in Taiwan with intermediate
cystinosis (219900) who had linear growth and weight gain within 2
standard deviations of the mean for their ethnic group until the ages of
13 and 14 years when their plasma creatinine concentrations were 1.2 mg
per deciliter and 3.3 mg per deciliter, respectively. They were found to
be homozygous for a 1308C-G mutation in the CTNS gene, resulting in the
substitution of lysine for the conserved asparagine at position 323
(N323K). Presumably, this mutation allowed for some residual cystine
transport, accounting for the mild clinical presentation.

.0017
CYSTINOSIS, ATYPICAL NEPHROPATHIC
CTNS, GLY110VAL

In a patient who had atypical nephropathic cystinosis (see 219800),
presenting with Fanconi syndrome (134600) and end-stage renal disease,
but surprisingly without extrarenal symptoms even late in life, Kalatzis
et al. (2002) detected a gly110-to-val (G110V) mutation situated in the
N-terminal region of the CTNS gene. As this substitution affected a
nonconserved residue, it was not expected to have a significant effect,
but it involved the last nucleotide of exon 6 and affected CTNS
splicing. Aberrant transcripts were produced that induced a frameshift
at amino acid position 111 and led to premature protein termination
prior to the seventh transmembrane segment; no correctly spliced CTNS
transcript could be detected. However, only leukocyte RNA was studied
and it was considered possible that G110V did not lead to the same
splicing events in all tissues. Misspliced transcripts in the kidney
might account for the severe renal phenotype, whereas the presence of a
correctly spliced form, even in small amounts, in other organs could
explain the lack of extrarenal disorders.

CYSTINOSIS, LATE-ONSET JUVENILE OR ADOLESCENT NEPHROPATHIC TYPE
CYSTINOSIS, ATYPICAL NEPHROPATHIC, INCLUDED
CTNS, SER139PHE

In 2 unrelated Spanish patients with juvenile-onset nephropathic
cystinosis (219900), Macias-Vidal et al. (2009) identified compound
heterozygosity for a 416C-T transition in the CTNS gene, resulting in a
ser139-to-phe (S139F) substitution, and a 4-bp deletion (606272.0004)
and a 57-kb deletion (606272.0005), respectively. The S139F mutation had
previously been identified in a patient with 'nonclassic' cystinosis
(see 219800), with onset before age 7 years but a milder course of
disease than the infantile nephropathic form, by Attard et al. (1999),
who suggested that the mutation might allow production of functional
protein or be located in a region of cystinosin that was not
functionally important.

171640	TITLE *171640 PHOSPHATASE, ACID, TYPE 5, TARTRATE-RESISTANT; ACP5
;;TARTRATE-RESISTANT ACID PHOSPHATASE; TRAP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Ketcham et al. (1988) cloned a full-length cDNA for type 5
tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase from human placenta and found that
it contained an open reading frame of 969 basepairs (corresponding to a
protein of 323 amino acids), a putative signal sequence of 19 amino
acids, and 2 potential glycosylation sites. The deduced amino acid
sequence of the human isozyme is 85% identical to the amino acid
sequence of porcine uteroferrin and 82% identical to the corresponding
regions of a partial amino acid sequence of the bovine spleen enzyme.
The type 5 isozyme of acid phosphatase is the most basic of the acid
phosphatases and is the only form insensitive to inhibition by
L(+)-tartrate. Normally, it is detected as a minor intracellular
component of spleen, lung, liver, and bone. High levels of acid
phosphatase-5 are found within the spleen and monocytes of patients with
Gaucher disease (230800). The type 5 isozyme is an iron-containing
glycoprotein with a molecular mass of approximately 34 kD.

Lord et al. (1990) also isolated a clone for ACP5, which is found
principally in resident tissue macrophages. They found that an ACP5 cDNA
clone contained an open reading frame of 975 bp, encoded a protein of
325 amino acids, including a single peptide of 19 residues and 2
potential sites for N-glycosylation.

MAPPING

Allen et al. (1989) assigned the ACP5 gene to 15q22-q26 by in situ
hybridization both to normal metaphase chromosomes and to the
chromosomes of an individual carrying an unbalanced translocation
involving chromosome 15. However, Grimes et al. (1993) showed that the
Acp5 gene maps to mouse chromosome 9 in a group of genes that are
homologous to a group of genes on 19p13.3-p13.1. By Southern blot
analysis of somatic cell hybrids and use of a PCR method, Leach et al.
(1994) confirmed the assignment of ACP5 to chromosome 19. By isotopic in
situ hybridization, Lord et al. (1990) mapped the APC5 gene to
19p13.3-p13.2 with a peak at 19p13.2.

GENE FUNCTION

Lord et al. (1990) found that the expression of ACP5 mRNA was restricted
to mononuclear phagocytes and that the enzyme was induced more than
20-fold on transformation of normal human monocytes to macrophages by
culture in serum-supplemented medium.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 10 patients with spondyloenchondrodysplasia with immune dysregulation
(SPENCDI; 607944) from 8 families, Briggs et al. (2011) identified
homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for mutations in the ACP5 gene
(see, e.g., 171640.0001-171640.0004). In vivo testing confirmed a loss
of expressed protein, and all 8 cases assayed showed elevated serum
interferon alpha (see IFNA1, 147660) activity, with gene expression
profiling in whole blood defining a type I interferon signature.

Simultaneously and independently, Lausch et al. (2011) mapped SPENCDI to
chromosome 19p13 and identified homozygous or compound heterozygous
mutations in the ACP5 gene in 14 affected individuals from 11 families
(see, e.g., 171640.0004-171640.0007). Lausch et al. (2011) demonstrated
that the mutations abolished TRAP enzyme function in serum and cells of
affected individuals, and that phosphorylated osteopontin accumulated in
serum, urine, and cells cultured from TRAP-deficient individuals.
Case-derived dendritic cells exhibited an altered cytokine profile and
were more potent than matched controls in stimulating allogeneic T-cell
proliferation in mixed lymphocyte reactions.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hayman et al. (1996) observed that mice with a targeted disruption of
the Acp5 gene, or Trap, suffered from developmental deformities of the
limb and axial skeleton and had osteoclasts defective in bone
resorption, resulting in mild osteopetrosis.

Bune et al. (2001) determined that macrophages of Acp5-deficient mice
had compensatory acid phosphatase activity attributable to the Acp2 gene
(171650) and enhanced proinflammatory responses in vitro. However, mice
lacking Acp5 showed delayed clearance of Staphylococcus aureus in vivo,
which was associated with reduced numbers of peritoneal macrophages, in
spite of normal macrophage and neutrophil phagocytosis and killing in
vitro.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPONDYLOENCHONDRODYSPLASIA WITH IMMUNE DYSREGULATION
ACP5, THR89ILE

In a Turkish brother and sister with spondyloenchondrodysplasia and
immune dysregulation (607944), born of first-cousin parents, Briggs et
al. (2011) identified homozygosity for a 266C-T transition in exon 4 of
the ACP5 gene, resulting in a thr89-to-ile (T89I) substitution at a
highly conserved residue. The brother, who was previously reported by
Navarro et al. (2008), presented at age 22 months with spasticity and a
vasculitic skin rash. Upon evaluation at 11 years of age, plasma levels
of total TRAP protein were negligible and TRAP 5a protein was
undetectable, and he had spasticity and intracranial calcifications,
elevated antinuclear antibody and anti-double-stranded DNA antibody
titers, and hypocomplementemia. His older sister, who was evaluated at
14 years of age for short stature, had a history of Raynaud phenomenon
but did not have elevated ANA or anti-dsDNA titers; she was, however,
found to have a high level of interferon-alpha (147660) in serum.

.0002
SPONDYLOENCHONDRODYSPLASIA WITH IMMUNE DYSREGULATION
ACP5, GLN223TER

In an 11-year-old Pakistani boy with spondyloenchondrodysplasia and
immune dysregulation (607944), born of first-cousin parents and
previously reported by Renella et al. (2006) as 'patient 10' (Crow,
2011), Briggs et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for a 667C-T
transition in the ACP5 gene, resulting in a gln223-to-ter (Q223X)
substitution. Plasma levels of total TRAP protein were negligible and
TRAP 5a protein was undetectable in this patient, indicating an almost
complete lack of TRAP synthesis or secretion. In addition to skeletal
manifestations, the patient had elevated antinuclear antibody and
anti-double-stranded DNA antibody titers and autoimmune hemolytic
anemia.

.0003
SPONDYLOENCHONDRODYSPLASIA WITH IMMUNE DYSREGULATION
ACP5, MET264LYS

In a female patient with spondyloenchondrodysplasia and immune
dysregulation (607944), who was born of first-cousin parents of
Portuguese descent and was originally reported by Roifman and Melamed
(2003), Briggs et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for a 791T-A
transversion in exon 7 of the ACP5 gene, resulting in a met264-to-lys
(M264K) substitution. Computational analysis indicated that this change
was likely to destabilize the structure of the protein. In addition to
skeletal changes, the patient had a history of recurrent infections,
elevated antinuclear antibody and anti-double-stranded DNA antibody
titers, thrombocytopenia requiring splenectomy, nonerosive arthropathy,
systemic lupus erythematosus, and hypothyroidism.

.0004
SPONDYLOENCHONDRODYSPLASIA WITH IMMUNE DYSREGULATION
ACP5, GLY215ARG

In a female patient from Mali with spondyloenchondrodysplasia and immune
dysregulation (607944), Briggs et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for
a 643G-A transition in exon 6 of the ACP5 gene, resulting in a
gly215-to-arg (G215R) substitution. This patient, who presented at 6
years of age with nephropathy, also had severe short stature with
metaphyseal dysplasia, elevated antinuclear antibody and
anti-double-stranded DNA antibody titers, and systemic lupus
erythematosus with class V lupus nephritis on renal biopsy.

In 2 unrelated girls with spondyloenchondrodysplasia, 14 years and 10
years of age, respectively, Lausch et al. (2011) identified homozygosity
for the G215R mutation in the ACP5 gene. In addition to skeletal
changes, the older girl had chronic thrombocytopenia, ataxia,
leukodystrophy, and basal ganglia calcifications, whereas the younger
girl had only calcifications of the left globus pallidus without
immunologic or neurologic symptoms. The mutation was not found in 228
control alleles.

.0005
SPONDYLOENCHONDRODYSPLASIA WITH IMMUNE DYSREGULATION
ACP5, GLY109ARG

In 2 sibs with spondyloenchondrodysplasia and immune dysregulation
(607944), Lausch et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for a 325G-A
transition in exon 7 of the ACP5 gene, resulting in a gly109-to-arg
(G109R) substitution. In addition to skeletal changes, both sibs had
systemic lupus erythematosus, the older sib also had arthralgia and
vitiligo, and the younger sib had arthritis; the older sib also had mild
developmental delay and diffuse intracranial calcifications as well as
of the basal ganglia, and the younger sib had basal ganglia and right
frontal lobe calcifications, but neither sib displayed neurologic signs.
In 2 additional affected individuals from unrelated families, 1 of whom
was the patient originally reported by Scharer (1958), Lausch et al.
(2011) identified compound heterozygosity for the G109R mutation and
another mutation in the ACP5 gene (see 171640.0006 and 171640.0007).
None of the mutations was found in 228 control alleles.

.0006
SPONDYLOENCHONDRODYSPLASIA WITH IMMUNE DYSREGULATION
ACP5, 3-BP DEL, 831CTA

In a 64-year-old Ashkenazi Jewish man with spondyloenchondrodysplasia
and immune dysregulation (607944), who was originally reported by
Scharer (1958) and later studied by Renella et al. (2006), Lausch et al.
(2011) identified compound heterozygosity for mutations in the ACP5
gene: a 3-bp deletion (813delCTA) in exon 7 and a G109R substitution
(171640.0005). The patient was diagnosed with systemic lupus
erythematosus at 9.5 years of age but was subsequently lost to
follow-up; the diagnosis of spondyloenchondrodysplasia was made 40 years
later upon reevaluation of his radiographs. In adulthood he had
continued to have recurrent fevers and arthralgias and developed
antiphospholipid syndrome, steroid-dependent neutropenia, and
thrombocytopenia.

.0007
SPONDYLOENCHONDRODYSPLASIA WITH IMMUNE DYSREGULATION
ACP5, LEU201PRO

In a 12-year-old patient with spondyloenchondrodysplasia and immune
dysregulation (607944), Lausch et al. (2011) identified compound
heterozygosity for mutations in the ACP5 gene: a 602T-C transition in
exon 6, resulting in a leu201-to-pro (L201P) substitution, and a G109R
substitution (171640.0005). In addition to skeletal manifestations, the
patient had thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, elevated
antinuclear antibody titers, childhood-onset spastic diplegia, and
calcification of the basal ganglia and frontal subcortical area.

;;ASPARAGINYL-tRNA SYNTHETASE, MITOCHONDRIAL;;
MITOCHONDRIAL ASNRS
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases for aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases containing a
mitochondrial targeting sequence, Bonnefond et al. (2005) identified
NARS2, which the called mitochondrial ASNRS. The deduced 477-amino acid
protein has an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal with a
predicted cleavage site after residue 14. NARS2 has characteristics of a
class II mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase and is expected to
function as a dimer.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bonnefond et al. (2005) determined that the NARS2 gene contains 14 exons
and spans 137.8 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Bonnefond et al. (2005) mapped the NARS2
gene to chromosome 11.

TIGHT JUNCTION PROTEIN 4; TJP4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of a mouse 11-day-old embryo library using
human DLG2 (603583) SH3 and GK domains as bait, Kawabe et al. (2001)
cloned mouse Tjap1, which they called Pilt. By database analysis, they
identified full-length human TJAP1, which encodes a 547-amino acid
protein with a calculated molecular mass of 60.7 kD. TJAP1 contains an
N-terminal coiled-coil domain and a central proline-rich region, and
shares 74% amino acid identity with its mouse homolog. TJAP1 shares 43%
and 51% amino acid identity over its N-terminal and C-terminal regions,
respectively, with the same regions of BEGAIN. SDS-PAGE detected TJAP1
as an 86-kD band. Northern blot analysis detected an approximately
3.0-kb transcript in all 16 human tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunofluorescence microscopy of mouse mammary tumor cells, Kawabe et
al. (2001) localized TJAP1 to cell-cell junctions where it colocalized
with ZO-1 (TJP1; 601009) at tight junctions. Using endogenous and stably
expressed TJAP1, the authors confirmed colocalization of TJAP1 and ZO-1
to tight junctions in small intestine cells where TJAP1 localized to the
Golgi complex. TJAP1 was absent from apical junctions and desmosomes. By
observing TJAP1 incorporation into cell-cell junctions over time in a
mouse wound healing model, the authors showed that TJAP1 was
incorporated into tight junctions at the very late stages of cell-cell
junction formation. Kawabe et al. (2001) used GST pull-down assays to
confirm that TJAP1 binds DLG2. Immunohistochemical studies using
cadherin deficient L-cells expressing claudin-1 (CLDN1; 603718) or JAM
(JAM1; 605721) showed no evidence of interaction between TJAP1 and
either of these 2 proteins.

;;DUBA2;;
HIN6 PROTEASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs; see 603478) are proteases that
specifically cleave ubiquitin (191339) linkages, negating the action of
ubiquitin ligases. DUBA2 belongs to a DUB subfamily characterized by an
ovarian tumor (OTU) domain.

CLONING

Kayagaki et al. (2007) identified ovarian tumor domain (OTU)-containing
protein 6A (OTUD6A) in a small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based screen for
OTU deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) family members. The 1,689-basepair
mRNA contains an open reading frame (ORF) predicting a 288-amino acid
protein.

MAPPING

The OTUD6A gene maps to chromosome Xq13.1 (Kayagaki et al., 2007).

DESCRIPTION Zinc finger proteins (ZNFs), which bind nucleic acids, perform many key
functions, the most important of which is regulating transcription. See
ZNF91 (603971) for general information on ZNFs.

By PCR-based screening of a human genomic YAC library using degenerate
oligonucleotides corresponding to a consensus sequence of the spacer
region of ZNF91 family members, Bellefroid et al. (1993) identified 23
distinct ZNF91-related genes, including ZNF100. They demonstrated that
members of the ZNF91 family are widely expressed in human tissues, with
the highest expression in T-lymphoid cells.

Bellefroid et al. (1993) mapped YAC clones containing ZNF91-related
genes by FISH and found that most of these genes, including ZNF100, are
clustered in 19p13.1-p12.

611041	TITLE *611041 TRIPARTITE MOTIF-CONTAINING PROTEIN 47; TRIM47
;;GENE OVEREXPRESSED IN ASTROCYTOMA; GOA
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE), Vandeputte et al.
(2001) identified a novel gene overexpressed in astrocytoma (GOA) with
respect to normal brain. The deduced 638-amino acid GOA protein contains
an N-terminal ring finger domain, 2 B-box domains, and a coiled-coil
domain, placing it in the RBCC (ring finger B-box coiled-coil) protein
family. In addition, GOA contains a C-terminal B30.2 domain and 2 LXXLL
motifs. GOA shares highest sequence identity with the
estrogen-responsive ring finger protein EFP (ZNF147; 600453). Northern
blot analysis detected a 2.3-kb transcript that was significantly
overexpressed in 6 of 7 high-grade astrocytomas and all 3 low-grade
astrocytomas examined in comparison with normal brain. In normal tissues
GOA was expressed at low levels comparable to those seen in normal
brain, with the exception of kidney, in which expression was about
10-fold higher. Using immunohistochemistry analysis, Vandeputte et al.
(2001) localized GOA protein to the nuclei of astrocytoma cells. While
immunoreactivity was nearly absent in normal adult astrocytes,
Vandeputte et al. (2001) demonstrated nuclear localization of GOA in
normal fetal brain astrocytes. In addition, GOA immunoreactivity
localized to kidney tubular cells but was absent from glomeruli.
Southern blot analysis of GOA gene dosage in 12 low-grade and 53
high-grade astrocytomas suggested that gene amplification is not a
frequent event in astrocytomas, as only 1 astrocytoma was found to have
3.5-fold GOA amplification. Vandeputte et al. (2001) suggested that GOA
may play a role in the process of dedifferentiation associated with
astrocytoma tumorigenesis.

MAPPING

Vandeputte et al. (2001) mapped the TRIM47 gene to chromosome 17q24-q25
by FISH.

603033	TITLE *603033 COLLAGENIC TAIL OF ENDPLATE ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE; COLQ
;;ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE-ASSOCIATED COLLAGEN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The COLQ gene encodes a collagen-like strand that associates into a
triple helix to form a tail that anchors catalytic subunits of
acetylcholinesterase (ACHE; 100740) to the basal lamina.

Asymmetric AChE is the major form of AChE at the endplate of the
neuromuscular junction in higher vertebrates. Asymmetric AChE is
composed of the T isoform of ACHE, ACHE(T), linked to a triple helical
COLQ tail. AChE rapidly hydrolyzes acetylcholine released at cholinergic
synapses in the nervous system, thus limiting the number of collisions
between ACh and the ACh receptor (AChR), and the duration of the
synaptic response (Ohno et al., 1998).

CLONING

Krejci et al. (1991) cloned ColQ from Torpedo. Krejci et al. (1997)
cloned the rat and mouse ColQ genes, and found that the ColQ subunits
form homotrimers and attach to AChE. Northern blot analysis detected
ColQ expression in cholinergic tissues, brain, muscle, and heart, as
well as in noncholinergic tissues such as lung and testes.

Ohno et al. (1998) used mouse ColQ primers to isolate human COLQ cDNA
from a human adult skeletal muscle cDNA library. The cDNA encodes a
deduced 455-amino acid protein with 89% homology to the rodent ColQ
peptide. Conserved domains include a secretion signal peptide, a
proline-rich attachment domain (PRAD) that interacts with AChE(T), 2
cysteines that form disulfide bonds with AChE(T), a collagen domain,
conserved cysteines that stabilize the tripal helical domain, and
proteoglycan binding domains that anchor the tripal helical domain to
the basal lamina. Several alternative transcripts were identified.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ohno et al. (1998) determined that the COLQ gene spans approximately 50
kb and comprises 17 constitutive exons and 2 alternatively transcribed
exons.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Ohno et al. (1998) mapped the
COLQ gene to chromosome 3p25. By radiation hybrid analysis, Donger et
al. (1998) mapped the COLQ gene to chromosome 3p24.2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In patients with endplate AChE deficiency (EAD; 603034), Ohno et al.
(1998) identified 6 recessive mutations in the COLQ gene
(603033.0001-603033.0006). Coexpression of each of the 6 ColQ mutants
with wildtype AChE(T) in SV40-transformed monkey kidney fibroblast (COS)
cells showed that a mutation proximal to the ColQ attachment domain for
AChE(T) prevented association of ColQ with AChE(T); mutations distal to
the attachment domain generated a mutant species of acetylcholinesterase
composed of 1 AChE(T) tetramer and a truncated ColQ strand. The authors
concluded that the mutations prevented the insertion of the gene product
into the basal lamina.

In 6 sibs with a mild form of endplate AChE deficiency, Donger et al.
(1998) identified a homozygous mutation in the COLQ gene (603033.0007).

Shapira et al. (2002) reported 3 novel mutations in the COLQ gene in 8
patients with variable features of EAD: 1 patient was a compound
heterozygote; the other 7 patients, 6 Palestinian Arabs and 1 Iraqi Jew,
were all homozygous for a gly240-to-ter mutation (G240X; 603033.0010),
suggesting a founder mutation. Expression studies of the 3 mutations in
COS-7 cells showed that each prevented formation of insertion competent
asymmetric AChE.

ANIMAL MODEL

Feng et al. (1999) generated ColQ -/- mice to study the roles played by
ColQ and AChE in synapses and elsewhere. Such mice failed to thrive and
most died before reaching maturity. They completely lacked asymmetric
AChE in skeletal and cardiac muscles, specifically at the neuromuscular
junction and in the brain. Nonetheless, neuromuscular function was
present. A compensatory mechanism appeared to be a partial ensheathment
of nerve terminals by Schwann cells. Such mice also lacked the
asymmetric forms of Bche (177400). Surprisingly, globular AChE tetramers
were absent as well, suggesting a role for the ColQ gene in assembly or
stabilization of AChE forms that do not contain a collagenous subunit.

COLQ, 215-BP DEL, NT107

In a patient with endplate acetylcholinesterase deficiency (603034),
Ohno et al. (1998) found deletion of 215 basepairs following nucleotide
107 of the COLQ gene. The deletion was caused by skipping of exons 2 and
3, causing a frameshift after codon 35. The mutation abolished the
proline-rich attachment domain (PRAD) and predicted 25 missense codons
followed by a stop codon. The mutation was present in compound
heterozygous state with the E214X mutation (603033.0002). The deletion
mutation was inherited from the mother and the truncating mutation from
the father.

In a patient with EAD (603034), Ohno et al. (1998) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the COLQ gene: an arg282-to-ter
(R282X) mutation and a 1-bp deletion (1082delC). The R282X mutation
truncated COLQ 10 codons upstream to the C-terminal end of the collagen
domain. The 1-bp deletion caused a frameshift after codon 360,
predicting 64 missense codons followed by a stop codon; 1082delC spared
the entire collagen domain but abolished the C-terminal domain of COLQ.

frameshift after codon 262, predicting 36 missense codons followed by a
stop codon. The 788insC mutation spared 85% of the collagen domain. The
asymptomatic parents were heterozygous for the mutation.

ENDPLATE ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE DEFICIENCY
COLQ, TYR431SER

In 6 affected sibs in a consanguineous Spanish family with EAD (603034),
Donger et al. (1998) identified a homozygous tyr431-to-ser (Y431S)
substitution in the conserved C-terminal domain of COLQ. The mutation
was predicted to disturb the attachment of collagen-tailed
acetylcholinesterase to the neuromuscular junction. Donger et al. (1998)
referred to the disorder in these patients as CMS Ic (for congenital
myasthenic syndrome type Ic). The authors noted that most previously
described CMS Ic patients had a marked decrease in total muscle
acetylcholinesterase with essentially no collagen-tailed forms. These
forms were present in affected members of the Spanish family but the
defect interfered with attachment to the neuromuscular junction.

.0008

Ohno et al. (1999) described a patient with congenital EAD (603034)
caused by compound heterozygosity for an arg315-to-ter (R315X) mutation
and a splice donor site mutation at position +3 of intron 16 of COLQ
(603033.0009).

.0009
ENDPLATE ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE DEFICIENCY
COLQ, IVS16DS, A-G, +3

See 603033.0008 and Ohno et al. (1999). Using a minigene harboring the
COLQ IVS16+3A-G mutation for functional expression studies, Ohno et al.
(1999) found that the splice site mutation resulted in skipping of exon
16. The mutant splice donor site of intron 16 harbors 5 discordant
nucleotides (at -3, -2, +3, +4, and +6) that do not basepair with U1
small nuclear (sn) RNA (RNU1; 180680), the RNA responsible for splice
donor site recognition. Versions of the minigene harboring, at either +4
or +6, nucleotides complementary to U1 snRNA restored normal splicing.
Analysis of 1,801 native splice donor sites revealed that the presence
of a G nucleotide at +3 is associated with preferential usage, at
positions +4 to +6, of nucleotides concordant to U1 snRNA. Analysis of
11 disease-associated IVS+3A-G mutations indicated that, on average, 2
of 3 nucleotides at positions +4 to +6 failed to basepair, and that the
nucleotide at +4 never basepaired, with U1 snRNA. Ohno et al. (1999)
concluded that, with G at +3, normal splicing generally depends on the
concordance that residues at +4 to +6 have with U1 snRNA, but other
cis-acting elements may also be important in assuring the fidelity of
splicing.

ENDPLATE ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE DEFICIENCY
COLQ, GLY240TER

In 6 Palestinian Arabs and 1 Iraqi Jew with variable features of EAD
(603034), Shapira et al. (2002) identified a homozygous 718G-T
transition in a splice acceptor consensus sequence of exon 12 of the
COLQ gene, resulting in a gly240-to-ter (G240X) mutation and causing
premature termination of the protein. The mutation prevented proper
formation of asymmetric AChE in COS-7 cells. The patients demonstrated
phenotypic variability, including differences in age of onset, disease
progression, respiratory and feeding difficulties, severity of weakness,
and ophthalmoplegia.

611781	TITLE *611781 PR DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 14; PRDM14
;;PFM11
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The PR domain is a protein-protein interaction module of about 100 amino
acids. PR domain-containing proteins, such as PRDM14, are often involved
in transcriptional regulation (Jiang and Huang, 2000).

CLONING

Scott (2008) stated that the PRDM14 gene encodes a deduced 571-amino
acid protein that is 68% identical to the mouse ortholog. Nishikawa et
al. (2007) stated that PRDM14 localizes to the nucleus.

MAPPING

By FISH, Nishikawa et al. (2007) mapped the PRDM14 gene to chromosome
8q13.3, where gene amplification has frequently been observed in human
tumors.

GENE FUNCTION

Nishikawa et al. (2007) examined expression profiles of 16 members of
the PRDM gene family in a panel of breast cancer samples and observed
overexpression of PRDM14 in about two-thirds of the samples studied at
both the mRNA and protein levels. Using quantitative real-time PCR, they
found that the copy numbers of the PRDM14 gene were relatively high in
tumors that overexpressed PRDM14 mRNA. Introduction of PRDM14 into
cancer cells with normally low endogenous PRDM14 enhanced cell growth
and reduced their sensitivity to various chemotherapeutic drugs. In
contrast, siRNA knockdown of PRMD14 induced apoptosis in breast cancer
cells and increased their chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity. Little, if
any, expression of PRMD14 was detected in normal tissues. Nishikawa et
al. (2007) suggested that PRMD14 may be an ideal therapeutic target for
the treatment of breast cancer.

Chia et al. (2010) reported a genomewide RNA interference screen to
identify genes that regulate self-renewal and pluripotency properties in
human embryonic stem cells. Functionally distinct complexes involved in
transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling were among the
factors identified in the screen. To understand the roles of these
potential regulators of human embryonic stem cells, Chia et al. (2010)
studied transcription factor PRDM14 to gain insights into its functional
roles in the regulation of pluripotency. Chia et al. (2010) showed that
PRDM14 regulates directly the expression of key pluripotency gene POU5F1
(164177) through its proximal enhancer. Genomewide location profiling
experiments revealed that PRDM14 colocalized extensively with other key
transcription factors such as OCT4, NANOG (607937), and SOX2 (184429),
indicating that PRDM14 is integrated into the core transcriptional
regulatory network. More importantly, in a gain-of-function assay, they
showed that PRDM14 is able to enhance the efficiency of reprogramming of
human fibroblasts in conjunction with OCT4, SOX2, and KLF4 (602253).

ANIMAL MODEL

Studies in mice provided evidence that specification of primordial germ
cells, the common source of both oocytes and spermatozoa, occurs through
the integration of 3 key events: repression of the somatic program,
reacquisition of potential pluripotency, and ensuing genomewide
epigenetic reprogramming. Yamaji et al. (2008) provided genetic evidence
that Prdm14, a PR domain-containing transcriptional regulator with
exclusive expression in the germ cell lineage and pluripotent cell
lines, is critical in 2 of these events, the reacquisition of potential
pluripotency and successful epigenetic reprogramming. In Prdm14 mutants,
the failure of these 2 events manifests even in the presence of Prdm1
(603423), a key transcriptional regulator for primordial germ cell
specification. Yamaji et al. (2008) concluded that their combined
evidence demonstrated that Prdm14 defines a previously unknown genetic
pathway, initiating independently from Prdm1, for ensuring the launching
of the mammalian germ cell lineage.

ADHESION MOLECULE ON GLIA, INCLUDED; AMOG, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION In the mouse, Malo et al. (1990) mapped the beta-2 subunit of
sodium-potassium-ATPase to chromosome 11 in a segment that is conserved
on the pericentromeric region of human chromosome 17. Thus, Malo et al.
(1990) speculated that the human ATP1B2 gene is on the proximal short
arm or pericentric area of chromosome 17. By somatic cell hybrid
analysis, Hsieh et al. (1990) demonstrated that the gene is indeed
located on human chromosome 17 and confirmed the assignment to mouse
chromosome 11, They referred to the gene as AMOG (adhesion molecule on
glia). The adhesion molecule on glia is an integral membrane
glycoprotein of MW 45-50 K that is expressed by glial cells and mediates
granule neuron migration along Bergmann glial cells in the developing
cerebellum. The cDNA sequence of the mouse gene (Pagliusi et al., 1989)
shows structural similarity to the beta subunit of Na,K-ATPase (ATP1B1;
182330). This enzyme consists of 2 subunits: a catalytic alpha subunit
and a beta subunit of unknown function. Like ATP1B1, AMOG is molecularly
associated with the alpha subunit and influences its catalytic activity.
AMOG may be the same as what is referred to here as ATP1B2. Another
beta-isoform gene expressed primarily in brain was isolated by
Martin-Vasallo et al. (1989); its sequence is 97% identical to that for
AMOG (Gloor et al., 1990). By study of recombinant inbred strains, Hsieh
et al. (1990) placed the Amog locus close to the genes for zinc finger
protein-3 (194480) and the asialoglycoprotein receptor (108360, 108361)
in a region of mouse chromosome 11 that is homologous to human 17p.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The NCOA2 gene encodes nuclear receptor coactivator 2, which aids in the
function of nuclear hormone receptors. Nuclear hormone receptors are
conditional transcription factors that play important roles in various
aspects of cell growth, development, and homeostasis by controlling
expression of specific genes. Members of the nuclear hormone receptor
superfamily, which includes the 5 steroid receptors and class II nuclear
receptors (see below), are structurally characterized by 3 distinct
domains: an N-terminal transcriptional activation domain, a central
DNA-binding domain, and a C-terminal hormone-binding domain. Before the
binding of hormone, steroid receptors, which are sometimes called class
I of the nuclear hormone receptor family, remain inactive in a complex
with heat-shock protein-90 (140571) and other stress family proteins.
Binding of hormone induces critical conformational changes in steroid
receptors that cause them to dissociate from the inhibitory complex,
bind as homodimers to specific DNA enhancer elements associated with
target genes, and modulate that gene's transcription. After binding to
enhancer elements, transcription factors require transcriptional
coactivator proteins to mediate their stimulation of transcription
initiation (Hong et al., 1997).

CLONING

Hong et al. (1997) identified a coactivator for a steroid hormone
receptor, which they termed glucocorticoid receptor-interacting
protein-1 (GRIP1). The complete coding sequence for GRIP1, isolated from
a mouse brain cDNA library, contains an open reading frame of 1,462
codons. This was thought to be the ortholog of the human protein called
transcription intermediary factor-2 (TIF2) by Voegel et al. (1996).

MAPPING

Carapeti et al. (1998) mapped the NCOA2 gene to chromosome 8q13.2-q13.3.

GENE FUNCTION

Hong et al. (1997) found that full-length GRIP1 interacts with the
hormone binding domains of all 5 steroid receptors in a
hormone-dependent manner and also with hormone binding domains of class
II nuclear receptors, including thyroid receptor-alpha (190120), vitamin
D receptor (601769), retinoic acid receptor-alpha (180240), and retinoid
X receptor-alpha (180245).

Myogenesis involves 2 processes, determination and differentiation.
Embryonic precursor cells become committed to the muscle lineage during
determination. In differentiation, the committed cells, or myoblasts,
acquire the contractile phenotype and form postmitotic multinucleated
cells. Proliferating myoblasts in culture express myogenic
differentiation antigen-1 (MYOD; 159970) and myogenic factor-5 (MYF5;
159990), whereas expression of myogenin (MYOG; 159980) coincides with
terminal differentiation. In addition to MYOG, a basic helix-loop-helix
(bHLH) protein, differentiation involves the concerted activation of
members of the MEF2 family (see MEF2A; 600660). CREB-binding protein
(CBP; 600140)/p300 (EP300; 602700) and p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF;
602203) are coactivators for MYOD during myogenic commitment and for
MEF2C (600662) during differentiation. Recruitment of these coactivators
depends on the presence of steroid receptor coactivators, a family of
structurally related and genetically distinct 160-kD molecules,
including NCOA1 (SRC1; 602691), NCOA2, and NCOA3 (601937). By Northern
blot analysis, Chen et al. (2000) showed that NCOA2 is expressed as a
7.5-kb transcript in both proliferating and confluent myoblasts;
expression of NCOA1 and NCOA3 was very low or undetectable. Western blot
analysis indicated that the level of NCOA2 protein increases during
myogenesis. Immunohistochemistry analysis demonstrated that NCOA2
function is required for expression of MYOG and CDKN1A (116899) and for
myogenic differentiation. Reporter assays and mammalian 2-hybrid
analysis indicated that the N-terminal bHLH-PAS domain and a C-terminal
activation domain (residues 1158 to 1423) of NCOA2 mediate the
coactivation of MEF2C-dependent transcription of muscle-specific genes
through the MADS box domain of MEF2C. Chen et al. (2000) also found that
both the N and C termini of NCOA2 interact with MYOG, supporting a model
of cooperative interaction of NCOA2, MYOG, and MEF2C in the regulation
of muscle-specific gene expression.

Chen et al. (2002) demonstrated that Carm1 (603934) and Grip1
cooperatively stimulated the activity of Mef2c in mouse mesenchymal stem
cells and found that there was direct interaction among Mef2c, Grip1,
and Carm1.

Jeong et al. (2007) found that SRC2 regulates murine endometrial
function and regulates progesterone-independent and -dependent gene
expression. Immunohistochemistry of pregnant mouse uterus showed that
SRC2 is expressed in the endometrial luminal and glandular epithelium
from pregnancy day 0.5. SRC2 is then expressed in the endometrial stroma
on pregnancy day 2.5 to 3.5. Once the embryo is implanted, SRC2 is
expressed in the endometrial stromal cells in the secondary decidual
zone. The compartmental expression of SRC2 can be mimicked by treatment
of ovariectomized mice with estrogen and progesterone. Ablation of SRC2
in the uterus resulted in a significant reduction in the ability of the
uterus to undergo a hormonally induced decidual reaction. Microarray
analysis of RNA from uteri of wildtype and Src2 -/- mice treated with
vehicle or P4 showed that SRC2 was involved in the ability of
progesterone to repress specific genes. This microarray analysis also
revealed that uteri of Src2 -/- mice showed alterations in genes
involved in estrogen receptor (133430), Wnt (see 164820), and bone
morphogenetic protein (BMP; see 112264) signaling.

Chopra et al. (2008) identified the transcriptional coactivator SRC2 as
a regulator of fasting hepatic glucose release, a function that SRC2
performs by controlling the expression of hepatic G6Pase. SRC2 modulates
G6Pase expression directly by acting as a coactivator with the orphan
nuclear receptor ROR-alpha (600825). In addition, SRC2 ablation, in both
a whole-body and liver-specific manner, resulted in a Von Gierke disease
(232200) phenotype in mice. Chopra et al. (2008) concluded that their
results positioned SRC2 as a critical regulator of mammalian glucose
production.

CYTOGENETICS

- MOZ/TIF2 Fusion Gene

Carapeti et al. (1998) identified an inv(8)(p11q13) associated with AML
(6016260) with M4/M5 morphology and prominent erythrophagocytosis by the
blast cells. A novel fusion between the histone acetyltransferase MOZ
(MYST3; 601408) and TIF2 was identified. Nucleotide 3745 of MOZ was
joined to nucleotide 2768 of TIF2. The fusion product MOZ/TIF2 retained
the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domains of both proteins and also
the CBP-binding domain of TIF2. Carapeti et al. (1998) suggested that
the phenotype observed arises by recruitment of CBP by MOZ/TIF2,
resulting in modulation of the transcriptional activity of target genes
by a mechanism involving abnormal histone acetylation.

Liang et al. (1998) also identified an inv(8)(p11q13) in cells derived
from a patient with acute mixed lineage leukemia. She had AML with M0/M1
morphology and M7 by histochemical staining. The inversion created a
fusion between the 5-prime end of MOZ mRNA (nucleotide 2974) and the
3-prime end of TIF2 mRNA (nucleotide 3744), which maintained the
translational frame of the protein. The predicted fusion protein
contained the zinc finger domains, the nuclear localization domains, the
HAT domain, and a portion of the acidic domain of MOZ, coupled to the
CBP interaction domain and the activation domains of TIF2. The
breakpoint was distinct from the breakpoint in the t(8;16)(p11;p13)
translocation in acute monocytic leukemia with erythrophagocytosis that
fused MOZ with CBP (Carapeti et al., 1998). The reciprocal TIF2/MOZ
fusion gene was not expressed, perhaps as a result of a deletion near
the chromosome 8 centromere.

Deguchi et al. (2003) showed that MOZ/TIF2 has transforming properties
in vitro and caused AML in a murine bone marrow transplant assay. The
C2HC nucleosome recognition motif of MOZ was essential for
transformation, whereas MOZ HAT activity was dispensable. However,
MOZ/TIF2 interaction with CBP through the TIF2 CBP interaction domain
was also essential for transformation. These results indicated that
nucleosomal targeting by MOZ and recruitment of CBP by TIF2 are critical
requirements for MOZ/TIF2 transformation, and indicated that MOZ gain of
function can contribute to leukemogenesis.

Aikawa et al. (2010) found that mouse MOZ/TIF2-induced AML stem cells
with high expression of Csf1r (164770) had increased leukemia initiating
activity than AML stem cells with same amount of MOZ/TIF2 protein and
low expression of Csf1r, when transplanted in irradiated mice. The high
Csf1r expressing cells had the phenotype of granulocyte-macrophage
progenitors and differentiated monocytes. In mice with leukemia due to
these cells, treatment with a drug-inducible suicide gene targeting
Csf1r-expressing cells resulted in curing of the leukemia for up to 6
months compared to controls. Induction of AML was suppressed in
Csf1r-deficient mice, and Csf1r inhibitors slowed the progression of
MOZ/TIF2-induced AML. Increased Csf1r expression was due mainly to the
hematopoietic transcription factor PU.1 (SPI1; 165170), which was
required for the initiation and maintenance of MOZ/TIF2-induced AML by
increasing transcription of Csf1r. Aikawa et al. (2010) suggested that
CSF1R is crucial for leukemia induced by MOZ fusion and indicated that
targeting of PU.1 may be a therapeutic option.

ANIMAL MODEL

Picard et al. (2002) found that Tif2 -/- mice were protected against
obesity and displayed enhanced adaptive thermogenesis, whereas Src1 -/-
mice were prone to obesity due to reduced energy expenditure. In white
adipose tissue, lack of Tif2 decreased Pparg (601487) activity and
reduced fat accumulation, whereas in brown adipose tissue, it
facilitated the interaction between Src1 and Pgc1-alpha (604517), which
induced the thermogenic activity of Pgc1-alpha. A high-fat diet
increased the Tif2/Src1 expression ratio, which may have contributed to
weight gain. These results revealed that the relative level of TIF2/SRC1
can modulate energy metabolism.

Gehin et al. (2002) found that Tif2-null mice were viable, but the
fertility of both sexes was impaired. Male hypofertility was due to
teratozoospermia and age-dependent testicular degeneration. Tif2 also
appeared essential for adhesion of Sertoli cells to germ cells. Female
hypofertility was due to placental hypoplasia, likely reflecting a
requirement for maternal Tif2 in decidua stromal cells facing the
developing placenta.

Ye et al. (2005) developed transgenic androgen receptor (AR;
313700)-reporter mice and crossed them with Src1 or Tif2 knockout mice
to analyze the contributions of Src1 and Tif2 to AR activity in testis.
In vivo imaging and reporter gene assays showed that testicular AR
activity was decreased significantly in mice with the Tif2 +/- mutation,
but not in those with an Src1 +/- background, suggesting that Tif2 is
the preferential coactivator for AR in testis. Immunohistologic analysis
confirmed that AR and Tif2 coexist in mouse testicular Sertoli cell
nuclei under normal conditions. Although Src1 concentrated in Sertoli
cell nuclei in the absence of Tif2, nuclear Src1 did not rescue AR
activity in the Tif2 mutant background. Src1 appeared to negatively
influence AR activity, whereas Tif2 stimulated AR activity.

Chopra et al. (2008) recognized that absence of Src2 coactivator results
in a glycopathy resembling Von Gierke disease in mice. Src2 null mice
show fasting hypoglycemia although the animals maintain normal glycemia
in the fed state. In mice fasted for 24 hours, plasma analysis
demonstrated increased concentration of triglycerides, cholesterol, free
fatty acids, and ketone bodies in Src2 null animals. Liver pathology
showed a characteristic mosaic pattern like that of patients with
glycogen-6 phosphatase deficiency. Periodic acid-Schiff staining, Oil
Red O staining, and electron microscopy revealed heavy accumulation of
glycogen and triglycerides in the liver of fasted Src2 null animals.
Livers of 24-hour fasted Src2 null animals contained about twice as much
glycogen and about 3 times as much triglycerides as did livers from
wildtype animals. This was accompanied by increased concentrations of
circulating glucagon and catecholamine in Src2 null animals, as
previously described by Gehin et al. (2002). These mice were also growth
restricted. Chopra et al. (2008) found that Src2 and Rora regulate
G6Pase without regulating PEPCK and FBP1.

614016	TITLE *614016 DIACYLGLYCEROL LIPASE, BETA; DAGLB
;;DAGL-BETA;;
DGL-BETA;;
DGLB
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DAGLB is a diacylglycerol (DAG) lipase (EC 3.1.1.34) that catalyzes the
hydrolysis of DAG to 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol, the most abundant
endocannabinoid in tissues. In brain, DAGL activity is required for
axonal growth during development and for retrograde synaptic signaling
at mature synapses (summary by Bisogno et al., 2003).

CLONING

By searching the human genome for sequences similar to Penicilium Dagl,
Bisogno et al. (2003) identified DAGLA (614015) and DAGLB. The deduced
full-length 672-amino acid DAGLB protein contains 4 transmembrane
domains near its N terminus, followed by a serine lipase motif, a
lipase-3 motif, and a C-terminal tail. The N terminus and catalytic
domain were predicted to reside inside the cell. Mouse and human DAGLB
share 79% amino acid identity. Dagla and Daglb were coexpressed in
axonal tracts of embryonic mouse at embryonic day 10, but were absent
from axonal tracts in adult mouse brain. In adult cerebellum, Dagla and
Daglb expression was restricted to deep cerebellar nuclei and synaptic
fields, including Purkinje cell dendrites.

GENE FUNCTION

Using sn-1-steroyl-2-arachidonoyl-glycerol as substrate, Bisogno et al.
(2003) showed that the membrane fraction of COS cells transfected with
mouse Daglb showed optimal activity at pH 7. Daglb showed a 3- to 8-fold
selectivity for the sn-1 over the sn-2 position of DAGs, and it appeared
to prefer sn-1-oleoyl-2 acyl-glycerols with linoleic acid more than
oleic, arachidonic, or stearic acids in the 2 position. Daglb was
sensitive to ser/cys-hydrolase inhibitors and to a drug that blocked
2-arachidonoyl-glycerol synthesis. Glutathione and calcium stimulated
Daglb activity.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the DAGLB gene to chromosome 7p22.1 based on an
alignment of the DAGLB sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF450090) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

ANIMAL MODEL

Tanimura et al. (2010) found that Dglb -/- mice were viable and appeared
normal. Histologic examination revealed no brain abnormalities, and
synaptic transmission, kinetics, and currents were no different from
wildtype. Endocannabinoid-mediated retrograde synaptic suppression was
intact in Dglb -/- brain.

191330	TITLE *191330 UBIQUINOL-CYTOCHROME c REDUCTASE-BINDING PROTEIN; UQCRB
;;UBIQUINONE-BINDING PROTEIN; UQBC;;
UQPC
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ubiquinone-binding protein is a nucleus-encoded component of
ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (Complex III; EC 1.10.2.2) in the
mitochondrial respiratory chain and plays an important role in electron
transfer as a complex of ubiquinone and QP-C. Complex III consists of 10
nuclear-encoded subunits and 1 mitochondrial-encoded subunit (cytochrome
b; 516020).

CLONING

Suzuki et al. (1988) obtained a partial cDNA for rat liver QP-C and used
this cDNA as a probe for isolating the human cDNA clone from a human
fibroblast cDNA library by colony hybridization. The total length of the
cloned cDNA was 518 basepairs with an open reading frame of 333
basepairs. The 111-amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide
sequence of the cDNA showed 85% identity to that of bovine QP-C and
contained only a single additional amino-terminal methionine. This
implied that the human QP-C is synthesized without a presequence which
is required for import of most nucleus-encoded mitochondrial proteins
into mitochondria.

MAPPING

Hosokawa et al. (1990) mapped the UQPC gene to chromosome 8 by study of
human-mouse somatic cell hybrids.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a Turkish girl with mitochondrial complex III deficiency nuclear type
3 (MC3DN3; 615158), Haut et al. (2003) identified a homozygous mutation
in the UQCRB gene (191330.0001). The authors stated that this was the
first mutation identified in one of the nuclear-encoded subunits of
complex III. The patient had episodic metabolic decompensation with
hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, and transient liver dysfunction, but
showed normal psychomotor development at age 4 years.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX III DEFICIENCY, NUCLEAR TYPE 3
UQCRB, 4-BP DEL, NT338

In a Turkish girl, born of consanguineous parents, with mitochondrial
complex III deficiency nuclear type 3 (MC3DN3; 124000), Haut et al.
(2003) identified a homozygous 4-bp deletion (nucleotides 338-341) in
exon 4 of the UQCRB gene, predicting a change in the last 7 amino acids
and the addition of a stretch of 14 amino acids at the C-terminal end of
the protein. Both parents were healthy and were found to be heterozygous
for the deletion. The patient had episodic metabolic decompensation with
hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, and transient liver dysfunction, but
showed normal psychomotor development at age 4 years.

604908	TITLE *604908 PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 4, REGULATORY SUBUNIT 1; PPP4R1
;;PP4R1
DESCRIPTION Protein phosphorylation on serine and threonine residues by protein
kinases is responsible for the communication of many intracellular
signals. Equally important is the dephosphorylation of proteins by
ser/thr phosphatases; see, for example, PPP2R1B (603113) and PPP2CA
(176915).

By peptide microsequencing of bovine PP4R1 and EST database searching,
Kloeker and Wadzinski (1999) identified a human PPP4R1 cDNA clone
encoding a 933-amino acid protein. Sequence analysis identified 13
'heat' repeats that are similar to those in the regulatory component
PP2A-A of PPP2R1B but are not contiguous. Mass spectrometry analysis
indicated that PPP4R1 is a 105-kD protein, whereas SDS-PAGE analysis
showed a doublet migrating at 120 to 125 kD. Immunoblot analysis
revealed that PPP4R1 copurifies with PPP4C (602035), suggesting that the
PPP4 complex contains at least 1 catalytic and 1 regulatory subunit.

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping consortium mapped the PPP4R1
gene to chromosome 18 (TMAP WI-13171).

611345	TITLE *611345 INTEGRATOR COMPLEX SUBUNIT 1; INTS1
;;INT1;;
KIAA1440
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

INTS1 is a subunit of the Integrator complex, which associates with the
C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II large subunit (POLR2A; 180660)
and mediates 3-prime end processing of small nuclear RNAs U1 (RNU1;
180680) and U2 (RNU2; 180690) (Baillat et al., 2005).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned INTS1, which they designated
KIAA1440. The deduced protein contains 1,377 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected highest expression in whole adult brain, with moderate to high
expression in all other adult and fetal tissues and all specific brain
regions examined.

GENE FUNCTION

By SDS-PAGE of proteins that copurified with INTS11 (CPSF3L; 611354) in
HEK293 cells, Baillat et al. (2005) identified INTS1 as a subunit of the
Integrator complex.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the INTS1 gene
to chromosome 7.

606817	TITLE *606817 PRE-T-CELL RECEPTOR, ALPHA-CHAIN PRECURSOR; PTCRA
;;PT-ALPHA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

In immature T cells the T-cell receptor beta-chain (TCRB; see 186930) is
rearranged and expressed before the TCRA (see 186880) chain. At this
early stage, TCRB can associate with the pre-T-cell receptor alpha chain
(PTCRA). The PTCRA, together with TCRB and the CD3 complex (see 186740),
minimally make up the pre-T cell receptor (pre-TCR), which regulates
early T cell development.

CLONING

Using a cDNA corresponding to mouse Ptcra as a probe to screen a human
thymus cDNA library, followed by 5- and 3-prime RACE, Del Porto et al.
(1995) isolated a cDNA encoding a protein they named PTA for 'pre-T-cell
receptor alpha chain.' The deduced 282-amino acid type I transmembrane
protein, 63% identical to the mouse protein, contains a leader sequence,
an Ig constant domain-like extracellular region with a potential
N-glycosylation site, a transmembrane region, and a 114-amino acid
cytoplasmic tail with 3 potential phosphorylation sites. The tail is
much longer than that in the mouse protein. Southern blot analysis
suggested the presence of a similar sequence in all species examined,
but the cytoplasmic tail region appears to be restricted to primates.
RT-PCR analysis detected expression in immature, but not mature,
thymocyte subsets with strongest expression in CD4+/CD8-/CD3-low cells
on their way to differentiate into CD4/CD8 double-positive thymocytes.

GENE STRUCTURE

By analysis of a chromosome 6 cosmid library, Saint-Ruf et al. (1998)
determined that the PTCRA gene contains 4 exons with a first intron rich
in repetitive Alu sequences and SINE and LINE elements. Analysis of the
region 1.5 kb upstream of the ATG start codon detected no CAAT or TATA
boxes or a potential promoter. However, the conserved 6.5-kb intron 1
contains binding sites for AP1 (165160) and for mu-EBP-C2. RT-PCR
analysis identified a smaller splice variant, PT-alpha-2, encoding a
231-amino acid protein lacking a major part of the Ig-like domain, due
to the elimination of exon 2. The variant lacks a potential
N-glycosylation site but retains a number of potential O-glycosylation
sites.

MAPPING

By radiolabeled in situ hybridization analysis, Del Porto et al. (1995)
mapped the PTCRA gene to chromosome 6p21.2-p12. The authors noted that
the mouse gene is localized to chromosome 17, also in the area of the
major histocompatibility complex. Saint-Ruf et al. (1998) refined the
localization to 6p21.3 by Southern blot and genomic sequence analysis.

ANIMAL MODEL

By expressing Ptcra mutants in transgenic mice and in cell lines,
Aifantis et al. (2002) showed that the conserved juxtamembrane cysteine
that could be a target for palmitoylation appears to be dispensable for
pre-TCR function. The nonconserved mouse cytoplasmic region,
particularly its somewhat conserved proline-rich domain, is required for
effective selection, proliferation, and survival of Tcrb-expressing
immature thymocytes.

610277	TITLE *610277 ORAI CALCIUM RELEASE-ACTIVATED CALCIUM MODULATOR 1; ORAI1
;;CALCIUM RELEASE-ACTIVATED CALCIUM MODULATOR 1; CRACM1;;
TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN 142A; TMEM142A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CRACM1 is a plasma membrane protein essential for store-operated calcium
entry (Vig et al., 2006).

CLONING

Store-operated calcium entry is mediated by calcium release-activated
calcium (CRAC) channels following calcium ion release from intracellular
stores. Feske et al. (2006) identified ORAI1, a protein crucial for
store-operated calcium (SOC) entry and CRAC channel function, using a
combination of 2 unbiased genomewide approaches: a modified linkage
analysis with SNP arrays, and a Drosophila RNAi screen designed to
identify regulators of SOC entry and nuclear factor of activated T cells
(NFAT; see 600489) nuclear import. The combination of these approaches
identified ORAI1 as the single candidate gene for SCID with a primary
defect in SOC entry and CRAC channel function in 2 patients. Feske et
al. (2006) identified 3 human genes, designated ORAI1, ORAI2 (610929),
and ORAI3 (610930), homologous to the Drosophila gene identified as a
regulator of calcium entry in their study. In Greek mythology, the Orai
are the keepers of the gates of heaven: Eunomia (Order or Harmony), Dike
(Justice), and Eirene (Peace).

To identify genes encoding the CRAC channel or other proteins involved
in its regulation, Vig et al. (2006) performed a genomewide RNA
interference (RNAi) screen in Drosophila cells. They identified CRAC
modulator-1 (Cracm1) as a novel gene essential for CRAC channel
function. Vig et al. (2006) characterized the human ortholog of Cracm1,
a 37.7-kD protein encoded by FLJ14466 that they called CRACM1.
Immunofluorescence confocal analysis localized CRACM1 to the plasma
membrane (PM), in keeping with the hydropathy profile of CRACM1, which
predicted a topology of 4 transmembrane domains with both ends facing
the cytosol.

GENE FUNCTION

Vig et al. (2006) showed that RNAi-mediated knockdown of human CRACM1
disrupted its activation. Overexpression of CRACM1 did not affect CRAC
currents, suggesting that CRACM1, although necessary for CRAC
activation, does not in and of itself generate significantly larger CRAC
currents.

Yeromin et al. (2006) showed that interaction between wildtype STIM1
(605921) and ORAI, assessed by coimmunoprecipitation, is greatly
enhanced after treatment with thapsigargin to induce calcium ion store
depletion. By site-directed mutagenesis, Yeromin et al. (2006) showed
that a point mutation from glutamate to aspartate at position 180 in the
conserved S1-S2 loop of ORAI transforms the ion selectivity properties
of CRAC current from being Ca(2+)-selective with inward rectification to
being selective for monovalent cations and outwardly rectifying. A
charge-neutralizing mutation at the same position, glu to ala, acts as a
dominant-negative nonconducting subunit. Yeromin et al. (2006) found
that other charge-neutralizing mutants in the same loop express large
inwardly rectifying CRAC current, and 2 of these exhibit reduced
sensitivity to the channel blocker gadolinium (Gd). Yeromin et al.
(2006) concluded that their results indicate that ORAI itself forms the
calcium ion selectivity filter of the CRAC channel.

Independently, Prakriya et al. (2006) showed that ORAI1 is a PM protein,
and that CRAC channel function is sensitive to mutation of 2 conserved
acidic residues in the transmembrane segments. Glu106-to-asp (E106D) and
glu190-to-gln (E190Q) substitutions in transmembrane helices 1 and 3,
respectively, diminished calcium ion influx, increased current carried
by monovalent cations, and rendered the channel permeable to cesium ion.
Prakriya et al. (2006) concluded that these changes in ion selectivity
provide strong evidence that ORAI1 is a pore subunit of the CRAC
channel.

Soboloff et al. (2006) showed that coexpression of STIM1 and ORAI1
resulted in an enormous gain in function of SOC entry. Expression of
ORAI1 alone inhibited SOC entry. Store-independent Ca(2+) entry was
enhanced by coexpression of ORAI1 and STIM2 (610841), but not STIM1.
Soboloff et al. (2006) concluded that ORAI1 is likely the channel entity
mediating SOC function. They noted that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
and PM localizations of STIM1 and ORAI1, respectively, are consistent
with their roles as ER Ca(2+) sensor and PM Ca(2+) channel,
respectively.

Independently, Mercer et al. (2006) showed that coexpression of STIM1
with ORAI1 resulted in enhanced SOC entry. Coexpression of STIM1 with
ORAI2 augmented SOC entry to a lesser extent, while ORAI3 alone or with
STIM1 had no effect on SOC entry, although it could rescue knockdown of
ORAI1 function. Fluorescence and confocal microscopy demonstrated that
STIM1 relocated from the ER to the vicinity of the PM following
depletion of calcium stores, but it was not detected on the cell surface
in the presence or absence of ORAI1. Mercer et al. (2006) proposed that
STIM1 regulates or interacts with ORAI1 at sites of close apposition
between the PM and an intracellular STIM1-containing organelle, such as
the ER.

Luik et al. (2008) defined the relationships among ER calcium ion
concentration, STIM1 redistribution, and CRAC channel activation and
identified STIM1 oligomerization as a critical ER calcium ion
concentration-dependent event that drives store-operated calcium ion
entry. In human Jurkat leukemia T cells expressing an ER-targeted
calcium indicator, CRAC channel activation and STIM1 redistribution
followed the same function of ER calcium concentration, reaching
half-maximum at about 200 micromolar with a Hill coefficient of
approximately 4. Because STIM1 binds only a single calcium ion, the high
apparent cooperativity suggested that STIM1 must first oligomerize to
enable its accumulation at ER-plasma membrane (PM) junctions. To assess
directly the causal role of STIM1 oligomerization in store-operated
calcium ion entry, Luik et al. (2008) replaced the luminal
calcium-sensing domain of STIM1 with the 12-kD FK506- and
rapamycin-binding protein (FKBP12; 186945) or the FKBP-rapamycin binding
domain of mTOR (601231). A rapamycin analog oligomerized the fusion
proteins and caused them to accumulate at ER-PM junctions and activate
CRAC channels without depleting calcium from the ER. Thus, Luik et al.
(2008) concluded that STIM1 oligomerization is the critical transduction
event through which calcium store depletion controls store-operated
calcium entry, acting as a switch that triggers the self-organization
and activation of STIM1-ORAI1 clusters at ER-PM junctions.

Using confocal microscopy, Lioudyno et al. (2008) demonstrated that both
STIM1 and ORAI1 accumulated in the immunologic synapse of either
activated or resting T cells in contact with antigen-pulsed dendritic
cells. Ca(2+) concentrations were increased near the interface of the
cells, and Ca(2+) signaling could be blocked by an ORAI1
dominant-negative mutant. Lioudyno et al. (2008) concluded that a
positive feedback loop exists in which the initial T-cell receptor
signal favors upregulation of STIM1 and ORAI1, which then augment Ca(2+)
signaling during subsequent antigen encounter.

Using human constructs and cell lines, Muik et al. (2008) showed that
STIM1 (605921) and ORAI1 interacted dynamically to activate PM Ca(2+)
currents. ER store depletion caused STIM1-STIM1 multimerization at the
ER, followed by STIM1-ORAI1 cluster formation at the ER-PM interface,
and both interactions were reversed by store refilling. The C terminus
of STIM1, when coexpressed with ORAI1, resulted in constitutive currents
in the absence of STIM1-ORAI1 cluster formation and ER store depletion.
Both N- and C-terminal deletion mutants of ORAI1 failed to generate
Ca(2+) entry or currents upon ER store depletion; the C-terminal ORAI1
mutant failed to interact with STIM1, and the N-terminal ORAI1 mutant,
which interacted with STIM1, exhibited a defect in channel gating.

By blocking SOC entry, but not receptor-operated calcium (ROC) entry
mediated by TRPC channels (e.g., TRPC1; 602343), Liao et al. (2009)
showed that ORAI1, when expressed at a level that enhanced SOC entry in
HEK293 human embryonic kidney cells, led to the appearance of
gadolinium-resistant ROC entry. ORAI1 with the
immunodeficiency-associated arg91-to-trp (R91W; 610277.0001) mutation
inhibited both ROC and SOC entry, as well as Ca(2+) entry elicited by
TRPC3 (602345) activation, in HEK293 cells. Liao et al. (2009) proposed
that SOC entry occurs through channels in lipid rafts, whereas ROC entry
occurs outside of lipid rafts.

Yuan et al. (2009) reported the molecular basis for the gating of ORAI1
by STIM1. All ORAI channels were fully activated by a conserved STIM1
amino acid fragment (residues 344 to 442), which Yuan et al. (2009)
termed STIM1 ORAI-activating region (SOAR). SOAR acted with STIM1 amino
acids 450 to 485 to regulate the strength of the interaction with ORAI1.
Activation of ORAI1 by SOAR recapitulated all the kinetic properties of
activation with full-length STIM1. However, mutations within SOAR did
not affect coclustering of STIM1 and ORAI1 in response to Ca(2+) store
depletion, indicating that coclustering is not sufficient for ORAI1
activation. SOAR-mediated activation required an intact alpha-helical
region at the C terminus of ORAI1. Deletion of N-terminal amino acids 1
to 73 of ORAI1 impaired activation by STIM1, but not by SOAR. In
addition, inward rectification of ORAI1 was mediated by an interaction
between the polybasic STIM1 residues 672 to 685 and a pro-rich region in
the N terminus of ORAI1. Yuan et al. (2009) concluded that the essential
properties of ORAI1 function can be understood by interactions with
discrete regions of STIM1.

Wang et al. (2010) revealed a regulatory link between Orai channels and
Ca(v)1.2 channels (see 114205) mediated by the ubiquitous
calcium-sensing STIM proteins. STIM1 activation by store depletion or
mutational modification strongly suppresses voltage-operated calcium
(Ca(v)1.2) channels while activating store-operated (Orai) channels.
Both actions are mediated by the short STIM-Orai activating region
(SOAR) of STIM1. STIM1 interacts with Ca(v)1.2 channels and localizes
within discrete endoplasmic reticulum/plasma membrane junctions
containing both Ca(v)1.2 and ORAI1 channels. Hence, STIM1 interacts with
and reciprocally controls 2 major calcium channels hitherto thought to
operate independently. Wang et al. (2010) concluded that such
coordinated control of the widely expressed Ca(v)1.2 and Orai channels
has major implications for calcium signal generation in excitable and
nonexcitable cells.

Srikanth et al. (2010) found that CRACR2A (EFCAB4B; 614178)
coimmunoprecipitated with ORAI1, ORAI2 (610929), ORAI3 (610930), and
STIM1 (605921), suggesting that CRACR2A may have a role in
store-operated calcium channels. Depletion of CRACR2A via small
interfering RNA severely reduced stimulation-induced clustering between
STIM1 and ORAI1. Depletion of CRACR2A in HEK293 cells or CRACR2B
(EFCAB4A; 614177) in Jurkat human T cells also decreased store-operated
calcium entry. Mutation analysis revealed that the EF hands of CRACR2A
bound calcium and that calcium binding reduced the interaction of
CRACR2A with ORAI1 and STIM1.

Feng et al. (2010) found that expression of the Ca(2+) transporting
ATPase SPCA2 (ATP2C2; 613082) was upregulated in several human breast
cancer cell lines and that upregulation was associated with elevated
Ca(2+) signaling, cell proliferation, and tumorigenicity in nude mice.
SPCA2 induced Ca(2+) influx was independent of both endoplasmic
reticulum Ca(2+) stores and the ATPase activity of SPCA2. SPCA2
interacted with the store-operated Ca(2+) channel protein ORAI1.
Knockdown of either SPCA2 or ORAI1 suppressed cell proliferation, colony
formation, and tumorigenicity in MCF-7 breast cancer cells to a similar
extent, and simultaneous knockdown did not confer additive effect. In
cells overexpressing SPCA2, cell transformation and elevation of basal
Ca(2+) levels were reversed by knockdown of ORAI1, consistent with a
role for ORAI1 downstream of SPCA2. Coimmunoprecipitation and pull-down
experiments with chimeric SPCA fragments revealed a 40-amino acid motif
within the N terminus of SPCA2 that interacted with ORAI1, while the C
terminus of SPCA induced cell transformation and constitutive Ca(2+)
signaling. Feng et al. (2010) concluded that SPCA2 interacts with ORAI1
by its N terminus and activates ORAI1-dependent but store-independent
Ca(2+) influx by its C terminus.

McNally et al. (2012) probed the central features of the STIM1 gating
mechanism in the human CRAC channel protein, ORAI1, and identified the
valine at residue 102 (V102), located in the extracellular region of the
pore, as a candidate for the channel gate. Mutations in V102 produce
constitutively active CRAC channels that are open even in the absence of
STIM1. Unexpectedly, although STIM1-free V102 mutant channels are not
Ca(2+)-selective, their Ca(2+) selectivity is dose-dependently boosted
by interactions with STIM1. Similar enhancement of Ca(2+) selectivity is
also seen in wildtype ORAI1 channels by increasing the number of STIM1
activation domains that are directly tethered to ORAI1 channels, or by
increasing the relative expression of full-length STIM1. Thus, exquisite
Ca(2+) selectivity is not an intrinsic property of CRAC channels but
rather a tuneable feature that is bestowed on otherwise nonselective
ORAI1 channels by STIM1. McNally et al. (2012) concluded that
STIM1-mediated gating of CRAC channels occurs through an unusual
mechanism in which permeation and gating are closely coupled.

Using a genomewide RNA interference screen in HeLa cells, Sharma et al.
(2013) identified filamentous septin proteins, particularly SEPT4
(603696), as crucial regulators of store-operated Ca(2+) entry. Septin
filaments and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2)
rearrange locally at endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane junctions
before and during formation of STIM1-ORAI1 clusters, facilitating STIM1
targeting to these junctions and promoting the stable recruitment of
ORAI1. Septin rearrangement at junctions is required for PtdIns(4,5)P2
reorganization and efficient STIM1-ORAI1 communication. Septins
demarcate specialized membrane regions such as dendritic spines, the
yeast bud, and the primary cilium, and serve as membrane diffusion
barriers and/or signaling hubs in cellular processes such as vesicle
trafficking, cell polarity, and cytokinesis. Sharma et al. (2013)
concluded that their data showed that septins also organize the highly
localized plasma membrane domains that are important in STIM1-ORAI1
signaling, and indicated that septins may organize membrane microdomains
relevant to other signaling processes.

MAPPING

Using linkage mapping by genomewide SNP array screen in 23 members of a
family in which 2 sibs had immune dysfunction associated with impaired
T-cell activation and CRAC channel dysfunction (612782), Feske et al.
(2006) mapped the ORAI1 gene to chromosome 12q24.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Feske et al. (2006) showed that 2 brothers with primary
immunodeficiency-9 (IMD9; 612782) due to T-cell inactivation (Feske et
al., 1996) were homozygous for an R91W mutation in the ORAI1 gene
(610277.0001). Expression of wildtype ORAI1 in SCID T cells restored
store-operated calcium ion influx and the CRAC current (I-CRAC).

ANIMAL MODEL

Bergmeier et al. (2009) generated transgenic mice expressing a blood
cell-specific R93W mutation in the Orai1 gene, which is equivalent to
the human R91W mutation. Mutant platelets showed defects in
agonist-induced store-operated calcium entry and certain
calcium-regulated platelet functions, such as integrin activation,
granule release, and surface phosphatidylserine exposure. However,
mutant platelets were able to aggregate and adhere to collagen under
arterial flow conditions ex vivo, presumably because calcium release
from intracellular stores was normal.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
IMMUNODEFICIENCY 9
ORAI1, ARG91TRP

In 2 sibs, born to consanguineous parents, with primary
immunodeficiency-9 (IMD9; 612782) characterized by impaired T-cell
activation (Feske et al., 1996), Feske et al. (2006) identified a 271C-T
transition in the ORAI1 gene, leading to an arg91-to-trp (R91W)
substitution at a conserved residue. Heterozygous carriers of the
mutation showed reduced calcium influx.

Muik et al. (2008) showed that the R91W mutation impaired Ca(2+) current
activation by ORAI1.

176395	TITLE *176395 PREGNANCY-SPECIFIC BETA-1-GLYCOPROTEIN 6; PSG6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The human pregnancy-specific glycoproteins (PSGs) are a group of
molecules that are mainly produced by the placental syncytiotrophoblasts
during pregnancy. PSGs comprise a subgroup of the carcinoembryonic
antigen (CEA) family, which belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily.

For additional general information about the PSG gene family, see PSG1
(176390).

CLONING

Teglund et al. (1994) noted that PSG10, which had been thought to be a
novel gene, is in fact an allelic variant of PSG6 that differs by 10 bp
in the coding region. (The allelic variant that had been referred to as
PSG10 should not be confused with the PSG10 gene; see 176399.)

GENE STRUCTURE

Teglund et al. (1994) determined that the PSG6 gene contains 6 exons.

MAPPING

Studies by several groups resulted in the mapping of the CEA gene family
to 19q13.1-q13.2 (Thompson et al., 1990; Thompson et al., 1992; Tynan et
al., 1992; Trask et al., 1993). The PSG subgroup is located telomeric of
the CEA subgroup, and together they span approximately 1.1 to 1.2 Mb
(Brandriff et al., 1992; Tynan et al., 1992). Using a high-resolution
restriction fragment fingerprinting technique, Olsen et al. (1994)
assembled 256 cosmids spanning the PSG region on 19q13.2 into a single
700-kb contig. FISH to sperm pronuclei and cosmid walking experiments
indicated that this PSG contig is telomeric of CGM8 at the telomeric end
of the CEA subgroup gene cluster. Detailed restriction mapping and
hybridization with gene-specific probes indicated that the order of the
11 PSG genes in the contig is cen--PSG3--PSG8 (176397)--PSG12 (PSG10;
176399)--PSG1 (176390)--PSG6--PSG7 (176396)--PSG13 (PSG11; 176401)--PSG2
(176391)--PSG5 (176394)--PSG4 (176393)--PSG11 (PSG9; 176398)--tel. The
PSG genes are tandemly oriented in a 5-prime to 3-prime direction from
telomere to centromere. The CEA subgroup gene CGM11 is located at the
telomeric end of the PSG gene cluster, and 6 genes belonging to a third
CEA family subgroup, namely CGM13 through CGM18 (later found to be
pseudogenes; see 109770), are interspersed among the PSG genes.

NOMENCLATURE

Beauchemin et al. (1999) provided a revised nomenclature for the CEA
gene family. Based on this nomenclature, the CEA family is composed of
the PSG subfamily, the CEACAM subfamily (see 109770), and the CEACAM
pseudogene (CEACAMP) subfamily (see 109770). PSG11, PSG12, and PSG13
were renamed PSG9, PSG10, and PSG11, respectively.

;;BCR1
BCR/ABL FUSION GENE, INCLUDED;;
BCR/FGFR1 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED;;
BCR/PDGFRA FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The normal cellular BCR gene encodes a 160-kD phosphoprotein associated
with serine/threonine kinase activity. The BCR gene is the site of
breakpoints used in the generation of the 2 alternative forms of the
Philadelphia chromosome translocation found in chronic myeloid leukemia
(CML; 608232) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (Groffen et al., 1984;
Shtivelman et al., 1985; Hermans et al., 1987). These alternative
breakpoints join different exon sets of BCR to a common subset of the
exons of the ABL1 gene (189980) located on chromosome 9. This fusion
results in 2 alternative chimeric oncogene products called p210(BCR-ABL)
and p185(BCR-ABL). The activation of ABL tyrosine kinase activity is
necessary for the oncogenic potential of the chimeric oncogene (Maru and
Witte, 1991).

Laurent et al. (2001) reviewed the role of BCR alone or when joined with
ABL in normal and leukemic pathophysiology.

CLONING

Hariharan and Adams (1987) isolated cDNA clones that spanned the entire
BCR coding region. The deduced 1,271-residue protein has a molecular
mass of about 160 kD. The BCR gene is expressed as mRNAs of 4.5- and
6.7-kb, which apparently encode the same protein.

Stam et al. (1987) showed that the normal gene on chromosome 22 involved
at the breakpoint cluster region in the translocation between
chromosomes 9 and 22 encodes a 160,000-Da phosphoprotein with serine or
threonine kinase activity.

Chissoe et al. (1995) sequenced the complete BCR gene and greater than
80% of the human ABL gene, which are both involved in the t(9;22)
translocation (Philadelphia chromosome) associated with more than 90% of
CML, 25 to 30% of adult and 2 to 10% of childhood acute lymphoblastic
leukemia, and rare cases of acute myelogenous leukemia.

GENE STRUCTURE

Heisterkamp et al. (1985) determined the structural organization of the
BCR gene, which contains 23 exons and occupies a region of about 135 kb
on chromosome 22. The first exon contains a unique serine/threonine
kinase activity and at least two SH2 binding sites.

Stam et al. (1987) demonstrated that the BCR gene is oriented with its
5-prime end toward the centromere of chromosome 22.

Chissoe et al. (1995) determined that the BCR gene contains 23 BCR exons
with putative alternative BCR first and second exons.

MAPPING

The BCR gene is located on chromosome 22q11.2, the site of the
translocation breakpoint in CML (Prakash and Yunis, 1984).

Croce et al. (1987) demonstrated that there are in fact 4 BCR genes, all
located in the 22q11.2 band. By studying mouse-human hybrid cells with
breakpoints at various sites in that region, they concluded that the
order of loci is centromere--BCR2, BCR4, IGL--BCR1--BCR3--SIS. This
linear order was confirmed by Budarf et al. (1988), who also confirmed
that all of the BCR-like genes map proximal to the 22q11-q12 breakpoint
of a t(11;22) in a Ewing sarcoma (612219).

Using an interspecific backcross, Justice et al. (1990) mapped the Bcr
gene to chromosome 10 of the mouse.

GENE FUNCTION

Maru and Witte (1991) demonstrated that purified BCR contains
autophosphorylation activity and transphosphorylation activity for
several protein substrates. A region encoded by the first exon was
essential for this novel phosphotransferase activity. The findings
suggested that the protein kinase and SH2-binding domains may work in
concert with other regions of the molecule in intracellular signaling
processes.

Diekmann et al. (1991) found that the C-terminal domain of BCR functions
as a GTPase activating protein for p21(rac); see rac serine/threonine
protein kinase (164730).

- BCR/ABL Fusion Gene

Nowell and Hungerford (1960) identified the Philadelphia chromosome of
chronic myeloid leukemia (a G group chromosome with part of its long arm
missing). It was called the Philadelphia chromosome because it was
thought to be useful to follow the practice of hemoglobinologists and
name anomalous chromosomes after the city of discovery. It was presumed
to be a deleted chromosome 21, the same chromosome as that which is
trisomic in Down syndrome (190685). The elevated alkaline phosphatase
activity in Down syndrome and depressed activity in CML was viewed as
consistent with this interpretation. Using the improved definition
provided by 'banding' methods, Rowley (1973) showed that in fact there
is a translocation of the distal part of chromosome 22 (not 21) onto
another chromosome, usually 9q.

Fitzgerald (1976) described a family in which a man and 2 of his 3
children had a Philadelphia-like chromosome t(11;22)(q25;q13). The fact
that they did not have leukemia or other hematologic disorder was
thought by Fitzgerald to relate to the finding that the break in
chromosome 22 was distal to that in CML. In these cases it was at the
q12-q13 interface, whereas in the Philadelphia chromosome it is at the
q11-q12 band interface. Thus the 22q12 band may contain critical genetic
material concerned with normal (and abnormal) myeloid proliferation.

De Klein et al. (1982) demonstrated that the Abelson oncogene is
translocated from chromosome 9 to chromosome 22 in the formation of the
Philadelphia chromosome.

Prakash and Yunis (1984) located the breakpoints in CML to subbands
22q11.21 and 9q34.1. Although the position of the breakpoint in
chromosome 9 is quite variable, the breakpoint in chromosome 22 is
clustered in an area called bcr for 'breakpoint cluster region.'
Shtivelman et al. (1985) referred to bcr as a gene and stated that the
ABL oncogene is transferred 'into the bcr gene of chromosome 22.' They
found that an 8-kb RNA specific to CML is a fused transcript of the 2
genes. The fused protein is presumably involved in the malignant
process. The protein has bcr information at its amino terminus and
retains most but not all of the normal abl protein sequences. Since the
breakpoint in 9 may be as much as 30 or 40 kb 5-prime to ABL, a large
amount must be 'looped out' in the fusion process. The fusion protein
has tyrosine kinase activity.

About 10% of patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) have the
translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11) indistinguishable from that of CML
(608232). Erikson et al. (1986), however, found in 3 of 5 such cases of
ALL that the bcr region was not involved and that the 22q11 chromosome
breakpoint was proximal (5-prime) to the bcr region. Furthermore, the
bcr and c-abl transcripts were of normal size in an ALL line carrying
the t(9;22) translocation. The breakpoints of the t(9;22) CML, the
t(9;22) of acute lymphocytic leukemia, and the t(8;22) of Burkitt
lymphoma fall into 22q11 and are cytologically indistinguishable. By
chromosomal in situ hybridization, however, they can be distinguished
(Emanuel et al., 1984; Erikson et al., 1986). To this experience,
Griffin et al. (1986) added observations on t(11;22), both
constitutional and tumor-related (see 133450). In the hybrid gene of
CML, the bcr contribution is 5-prime to the abl contribution. In the
creation of the gene, splicing can occur across an interval as great as
100 kb. The product of the bcr/abl hybrid gene is a 210-kD protein. It
was suggested that the hybrid gene and its product protein be designated
PHL.

Mes-Masson et al. (1986) isolated overlapping cDNA clones defining the
complete coding region for the hybrid protein generated from the ABL and
BCR genes.

As a result of the CML translocation, the 3-prime BCR exons are removed
and remain on chromosome 22 (Stam et al., 1987). The BCR and ABL genes
are fused in a head-to-tail fashion.

Verhest and Monsieur (1983) found the Philadelphia chromosome in a case
of essential thrombocytopenia.

Ganesan et al. (1986) found that the BCR gene was rearranged in 7 cases
of Philadelphia chromosome-negative CML. In 5 cases hematologic findings
were indistinguishable from those of patients with the Philadelphia
chromosome.

Hermans et al. (1987) showed that a distinct and different fusion of BCR
and ABL occurs in creation of the Philadelphia chromosome associated
with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Rubin et al. (1988) similarly
reported a distinctive fusion in ALL.

Haas et al. (1992) demonstrated a 'parent of origin' bias in cases of
Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemia by use of unique specific
chromosome band polymorphisms. They showed that the translocated
chromosome 9 was always of paternal origin, whereas the translocated
chromosome 22 was derived exclusively from the maternal copy.
Preferential retention of paternal alleles has been found in sporadic
tumors such as Wilms tumor (194070), rhabdomyosarcoma (268210),
osteosarcoma (259500), and retinoblastoma (180200). The finding of
preferential participation of the paternally derived chromosome 9 and
the maternally derived chromosome 22 in the Ph-translocation strongly
indicates that the chromosomal regions involved are imprinted. Feinberg
(1993) reviewed 11 examples of preferential parental allelic alterations
in cancer. Fioretos et al. (1994) were unable to find evidence for
genomic imprinting of the human BCR gene. They identified a BamHI
polymorphism in the coding region of BCR exon 1 and by RT-PCR assay
showed that both BCR alleles are expressed in the peripheral blood cells
of normal persons. Furthermore, Litz and Copenhaver (1994) used PvuII
and MaeII restriction site polymorphisms in the BCR gene to study 3
cases of Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML. In all 3 cases, the
rearranged allele was paternal in origin. Melo et al. (1994) could find
no evidence of parental imprinting of the ABL gene and cited evidence
which appeared to exclude imprinting of the BCR gene and to suggest that
there is, in fact, no preferential involvement of the maternal BCR or
paternal ABL alleles in the formation of the BCR-ABL fusion gene. Melo
et al. (1995) further reviewed the evidence they interpreted as
indicating that there is no parental bias in the origin of the
translocated ABL gene and no evidence for genomic imprinting of ABL in
CML. On the other hand, Haas (1995) argued that it still remains likely
that ABL and BCR are imprinted.

From the sequence of 4 newly studied Philadelphia chromosome
translocations and a review of several other previously sequenced
breakpoints, Chissoe et al. (1995) could discern no consistent
breakpoint features. No clear-cut mechanism for Philadelphia chromosome
translocation was evident.

To block BCR/ABL function, Lim et al. (2000) created a unique tyrosine
phosphatase by fusing the catalytic domain of SHP1 (604630) to the ABL
binding domain of RIN1 (605965), an established binding partner and
substrate for c-ABL and BCR/ABL. This fusion construct binds to BCR/ABL
in cells and functions as an active phosphatase. It effectively
suppressed BCR/ABL function as judged by reductions in transformation of
fibroblast cells, growth factor independence of hematopoietic cell
lines, and proliferation of primary bone marrow cells. In addition, the
leukemogenic properties of BCR/ABL in a murine model system were blocked
by coexpression of the fusion construct. Expression of the construct
also reversed the transformed phenotype of a human leukemia-derived cell
line. These results appeared to have direct implications for leukemia
therapeutics and suggested an approach to block aberrant signal
transduction in other pathologies through the use of appropriately
designed escort/inhibitors.

Saglio et al. (2002) found that a patient with a typical form of CML
carried a large deletion on the derivative chromosome 9q+ and an unusual
BCR-BCL transcript characterized by the insertion, between BCR exon 14
and ABL exon 2, of 126 bp derived from a region located on chromosome 9,
1.4 Mb 5-prime to ABL. This sequence was contained in a bacterial
artificial chromosome (BAC), which in FISH experiments on normal
metaphases was found to detect, in addition to the predicted clear
signal at 9q34, a faint but distinct signal at 22q11.2, where the BCR
gene is located, suggesting the presence of a large region of homology
between the 2 chromosome regions. A BLAST analysis of the particular BAC
sequence against the entire human genome revealed the presence of a
stretch of homology, about 76 kb long, located approximately 150 kb
3-prime to the BCR gene, and containing the 126-bp insertion sequence.
Evolutionary studies using FISH identified the region as a duplicon,
which transposed from the region orthologous to human 9q34 to chromosome
22 after the divergence of orangutan from the human-chimpanzee-gorilla
common ancestor about 14 million years ago. Saglio et al. (2002) noted
that sequence analyses reported as part of the Human Genome Project had
disclosed an unpredicted extensive segmental duplication in the human
genome, and the impact of duplicons in triggering genomic disorders is
becoming more and more apparent. The discovery of a large duplicon
relatively close to the ABL and BCR genes and the finding that the
126-bp insertion is very close to the duplicon at 9q34 open the question
of the possible involvement of the duplicon in the formation of the
Philadelphia chromosome translocation.

The arrest of differentiation is a feature of chronic myelogenous
leukemia cells both in myeloid blast crisis and in myeloid precursors
that ectopically express the p210(BCR-ABL) oncoprotein. Related to the
underlying mechanisms of this arrest of differentiation, Perrotti et al.
(2002) showed that expression of BCR-ABL in myeloid precursor cells
leads to transcriptional suppression of the gene encoding granulocyte
colony-stimulating factor receptor (CSF3R; 138971), possibly through
downmodulation of C/EBP-alpha (116897), the principal regulator of
granulocytic differentiation. Expression of C/EBP-alpha protein is
barely detectable in primary marrow cells taken from individuals
affected with chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis. In contrast,
CEBPA RNA is clearly present. Further experiments by Perrotti et al.
(2002) indicated that BCR-ABL regulates the expression of C/EBP-alpha by
inducing heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein E2 (PCBP2; 601210).

RNA interference (RNAi) is a highly conserved regulatory mechanism that
mediates sequence-specific posttranscriptional gene silencing initiated
by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) (Fire, 1999). Fusion transcripts encoding
oncogenic proteins may represent potential targets for a tumor-specific
RNAi approach. Scherr et al. (2003) demonstrated that small interfering
RNAs (siRNAs) against BCR-ABL specifically inhibited expression of
BCR-ABL mRNA in hematopoietic cell lines and primary CML cells.

Goldman and Melo (2003) tabulated BCR-ABL substrates and diagrammed the
signal-transduction pathways affected by BCR-ABL.

To define oncogenic lesions that cooperate with BCR-ABL1 to induce ALL,
Mullighan et al. (2008) performed a genomewide analysis of diagnostic
leukemia samples from 304 individuals with ALL, including 43 BCR-ABL1
B-progenitor ALLs and 23 CML cases. IKZF1, encoding the transcription
factor Ikaros (603023), was deleted in 83.7% of BCR-ABL1 ALL, but not in
chronic phase CML. Deletion of IKZF1 was also identified as an acquired
lesion at the time of transformation of CML to ALL (lymphoid blast
crisis). The IKZF1 deletions resulted in haploinsufficiency, expression
of a dominant-negative Ikaros isoform, or the complete loss of Ikaros
expression. Sequencing of IKZF1 deletion breakpoints suggested that
aberrant RAG-mediated recombination (see 179615) is responsible for the
deletions. Mullighan et al. (2008) concluded that genetic lesions
resulting in the loss of Ikaros function are an important event in the
development of BCR-ABL1 ALL.

Zhao et al. (2009) demonstrated that the loss of Smoothened (Smo;
601500), an essential component of the hedgehog pathway (see 600725),
impairs hematopoietic stem cell renewal and decreases induction of
chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML; 608232) by the BCR-ABL1 oncoprotein.
Loss of Smo causes depletion of CML stem cells, which propagate the
leukemia, whereas constitutively active Smo augments CML stem cell
number and accelerates disease. As a possible mechanism for Smo action,
Zhao et al. (2009) showed that the cell fate determinant Numb (603728),
which depletes CML stem cells, is increased in the absence of Smo
activity. Furthermore, pharmacologic inhibition of hedgehog signaling
impairs not only the propagation of CML driven by wildtype BCR-ABL1, but
also the growth of imatinib-resistant mouse and human CML. Zhao et al.
(2009) concluded that hedgehog pathway activity is required for
maintenance of normal and neoplastic stem cells of the hematopoietic
system and raised the possibility that the drug resistance and disease
recurrence associated with imatinib treatment of CML might be avoided by
targeting this essential stem cell maintenance pathway.

Resistance of Bcr-Abl-positive leukemic stem cells (LSCs) to imatinib
treatment in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; 608232) can
cause relapse of disease and might be the origin for emerging
drug-resistant clones. Dierks et al. (2008) identified Smo as a drug
target in Bcr-Abl-positive LSCs. They showed that Hedgehog signaling is
activated in LSCs through upregulation of Smo. While nullity for Smo
does not affect long-term reconstitution of regular hematopoiesis, the
development of retransplantable Bcr-Abl-positive leukemias was abolished
in the absence of Smo expression. Pharmacologic Smo inhibition reduced
LSCs in vivo and enhanced time to relapse after end of treatment. Dierks
et al. (2008) postulated that Smo inhibition might be an effective
treatment strategy to reduce the LSC pool in CML.

Using xenografting and DNA copy number alteration (CNA) profiling of
human BCR-ABL1 lymphoblastic leukemia, Notta et al. (2011) demonstrated
that genetic diversity occurs in functionally defined
leukemia-initiating cells and that many diagnostic patient samples
contain multiple genetically distinct leukemia-initiating cell
subclones. Reconstructing the subclonal genetic ancestry of several
samples by CNA profiling demonstrated a branching multiclonal evolution
model of leukemogenesis, rather than linear succession. For some patient
samples, the predominant diagnostic clone repopulated xenografts,
whereas in others it was outcompeted by minor subclones. Reconstitution
with the predominant diagnosis clone was associated with more aggressive
growth properties in xenografts, deletion of CDKN2A (600160) and CDKN2B
(600431), and a trend towards poorer patient outcome. Notta et al.
(2011) concluded that their findings linked clonal diversity with
leukemia-initiating cell function and underscored the importance of
developing therapies that eradicate all intratumoral subclones.

- BCR/FGFR1 Fusion Gene

Demiroglu et al. (2001) described 2 patients with a clinical and
hematologic diagnosis of CML in chronic phase who had an acquired
t(8;22)(p11;q11). They confirmed that both patients were negative for a
BCR-ABL fusion gene and that both had an in-frame mRNA fusion between
BCR exon 4 and FGFR1 (136350) exon 9. Thus, a BCR-FGFR1 fusion may occur
in patients with apparently typical CML. The possibility of successful
treatment with specific FGFR1 inhibitors was suggested.

- BCR/PDGFRA Fusion Gene

Baxter et al. (2002) reported the identification and cloning of a rare
variant translocation, t(4;22)(q12;q11), in 2 patients with a CML-like
myeloproliferative disease. An unusual in-frame BCR/PDGFRA (173490)
fusion mRNA was identified in both patients, with either BCR exon 7 or
exon 12 fused to short BCR intron-derived sequences, which were in turn
fused to part of PDGFRA exon 12. Sequencing of the genomic breakpoint
junctions showed that the chromosome 22 breakpoints fell in BCR introns,
whereas the chromosome 4 breakpoints were within PDGFRA exon 12.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Resistance to Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors

Clinical studies with the Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 in CML
demonstrated that many patients with advanced-stage disease respond
initially but then relapse. Through biochemical and molecular analysis
of clinical material, Gorre et al. (2001) found that the drug resistance
was associated with a reactivation of BCR-ABL signal transduction in all
cases examined. In 6 of 9 patients, resistance was associated with a
single amino acid substitution in a threonine residue of the Abl kinase
domain known to form a critical hydrogen bond with the drug. This
substitution (T315I; 189980.0001) was sufficient to confer STI571
resistance in a reconstitution experiment. In 3 patients, resistance was
associated with progressive BCR-ABL gene amplification. Gorre et al.
(2001) concluded that their studies provided evidence that genetically
complex cancers retain dependence on an initial oncogenic event and
suggested a strategy for identifying inhibitors of STI571 resistance.

Azam et al. (2003) stated that sequencing of the BCR-ABL gene in
patients who relapsed after STI571 chemotherapy revealed a limited set
of kinase domain mutations that mediate drug resistance. To obtain a
more comprehensive survey of the amino acid substitutions that confer
STI571 resistance, they performed an in vitro screen of randomly
mutagenized BCR-ABL and recovered all the major mutations previously
identified in patients and numerous others that illuminated novel
mechanisms of acquired drug resistance. Structural modeling implied that
a novel class of variants acts allosterically to destabilize the
autoinhibited conformation of the ABL kinase, to which STI571
preferentially binds. The authors concluded that this screening strategy
is a paradigm applicable to a growing list of target-directed anticancer
agents and provides a means of anticipating the drug-resistant amino
acid substitutions that are likely to be clinically problematic.

Resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) develops in virtually
all cases of Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic
leukemia. Duy et al. (2011) reported the discovery of a novel mechanism
of drug resistance that is based on protective feedback signaling of
leukemia cells in response to treatment with TKIs. In Philadelphia
chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells, Duy et al.
(2011) identified BCL6 (109565) as a central component of this
drug-resistance pathway and demonstrated that targeted inhibition of
BCL6 leads to eradication of drug-resistant and leukemia-initiating
subclones.

ANIMAL MODEL

To determine whether the P210(bcr/abl) hybrid protein can induce
leukemia, Daley et al. (1990) infected murine bone marrow with a
retrovirus encoding this protein and transplanted the bone marrow into
irradiated syngeneic recipients. Transplant recipients developed several
hematologic malignancies, prominent among which was a myeloproliferative
syndrome closely resembling the chronic phase of human chronic
myelogenous leukemia. Tumor tissue from diseased mice harbored the
provirus encoding P210(bcr/abl). Heisterkamp et al. (1990) satisfied
Koch postulates in relation to leukemia by demonstrating leukemia in
mice transgenic for a bcr/abl p190 construct of the type found in acute
lymphoblastic leukemia. Tkachuk et al. (1990) used 2-color fluorescence
in situ hybridization (FISH) with probes from portions of the BCR and
ABL (189980) genes to detect the BCR-ABL fusion in individual blood and
bone marrow cells from 6 patients. The fusion event was detected in all
samples analyzed, of which 3 were cytogenetically Ph(1)-negative. One of
the Ph(1)-negative samples was also PCR-negative.

When the Philadelphia-chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia-blast
crisis cell line BV173 is injected into SCID mice, a disease process
closely resembling that seen in leukemia patients results (Kamel-Reid et
al., 1989). For example, BCR-ABL transcripts are detectable in bone
marrow, spleen, peripheral blood, liver, and lungs. Skorski et al.
(1994) found that systemic treatment of the leukemic mice with a 26-mer
BCR-ABL antisense oligodeoxynucleotide induced disappearance of leukemic
cells and a marked decrease in BCR-ABL mRNA in mouse tissues. Untreated
mice or mice treated with a BCR-ABL sense oligodeoxynucleotide or a
6-base-mismatched antisense oligodeoxynucleotide were dead 8 to 13 weeks
after leukemia cell injection; in marked contrast, mice treated with
BCR-ABL antisense oligodeoxynucleotide died of leukemia 18 to 23 weeks
after injection of leukemic cells. Findings were interpreted as
indicating the in vivo effectiveness of an anticancer therapy based on
antisense oligodeoxynucleotides targeting a tumor-specific gene.

Cancer is thought to arise from multiple genetic events that establish
irreversible malignancy. A different mechanism might be present in
certain leukemias initiated by a chromosomal translocation. Huettner et
al. (2000) adopted a new approach to determine if ablation of the
genetic abnormality is sufficient for reversion. They generated a
conditional transgenic model of BCR-ABL-induced leukemia. The most
common form of the product of the fusion gene, p210 BCR-ABL1, is found
in more than 90% of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia and in up
to 15% of adult patients with de novo acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
Efforts to establish a useful transgenic model had been hampered by
embryonic lethality when the oncogene is expressed during embryogenesis,
by reduced penetrance, or by extremely long latency. Huettner et al.
(2000) used the 'knock-in' approach to induce leukemia by p190 BCR-ABL1
(Castellanos et al., 1997). Lethal leukemia developed within an
acceptable time frame in all animals, and complete remission was
achieved by suppression of BCR-ABL1 expression, even after multiple
rounds of induction and reversion. The results demonstrated that
BCR-ABL1 is required for both induction and maintenance of leukemia. The
findings suggested that complete and lasting remissions can be achieved
if the genetic abnormality is abolished or silenced before secondary
mutations are acquired. The results have implications for therapies that
directly target leukemia oncogenes, with a relevant example being the
use of BCR-ABL1-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

Tanabe et al. (2000) designed a ribozyme which exclusively targets the
junction sequence of BCR-ABL and showed that it specifically cleaves the
BCR-ABL mRNA, inducing apoptosis in CML cells. Tanabe et al. (2000)
tested this technology in vivo by embedding genes encoding the maxizyme
downstream of genes for the human tRNA. They used a retroviral system
for the expression of the maxizyme in leukemic cells. A line of CML
cells was transduced either with a control vector in which the maxizyme
sequence had been deleted or with the maxizyme-encoding vector. They
then injected 2 x 10(6) transduced cells into the tail veins of NOD-SCID
mice. Animals transduced with the control vector died between 6 and 13
weeks afterwards due to diffuse leukemia. Animals treated with the
BCR-ABL ribozyme all survived, with no evidence of leukemia in 8 animals
8 weeks after inoculation. Tanabe et al. (2000) stated that their
maxizyme could be useful for purging bone marrow in cases of CML treated
by autologous transplantation, when it would presumably reduce the
incidence of relapse by decreasing the tumorigenicity of contaminating
CML cells in the transplant.

Voncken et al. (1995) found that exposure of Bcr-null mice to
gram-negative endotoxin led to severe septic shock and increased tissue
injury by neutrophils. Neutrophils of Bcr-null mice showed a pronounced
increase in reactive oxygen metabolite production upon activation and
were more sensitive to priming stimuli. Activated Bcr-null neutrophils
displayed a 3-fold increase in Rac2 (602049) membrane translocation
compared with wildtype neutrophils. The results showed that BCR is
involved in the regulation of RAC-mediated superoxide production by the
NADPH-oxidase system (see NOX1; 300225) of leukocytes and suggested a
link between BCR function and the cell type affected in Philadelphia
chromosome-positive leukemias.

;;SUN DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1;;
UNC84, C. ELEGANS, HOMOLOG OF, A; UNC84A;;
KIAA0810
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SUN1 and SUN2 (613569) are inner nuclear membrane (INM) proteins that
play a major role in nuclear-cytoplasmic connection by formation of a
'bridge' across the nuclear envelope, known as the LINC complex, via
interaction with the conserved luminal KASH domain of nesprins (e.g.,
SYNE1; 608441) located in the outer nuclear membrane (ONM). The LINC
complex provides a direct connection between the nuclear lamina and the
cytoskeleton, which contributes to nuclear positioning and cellular
rigidity (summary by Haque et al., 2010).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned UNC84A, which they called KIAA0810.
The deduced protein contains 824 amino acids. UNC84A shares about 32%
identity over 191 amino acids with Sad1 of Saccharomyces pombe. RT-PCR
ELISA revealed weak to moderate expression in most tissues examined.
Highest expression was detected in heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and
ovary, and weakest expression was detected in spleen.

By searching databases for homologs of C. elegans Unc84, followed by
5-prime RACE of a brain cDNA library, Malone et al. (1999) cloned human
SUN1 and SUN2. The predicted proteins contain 824 and 724 amino acids,
respectively, and their C termini share homology with the C termini of
C. elegans Unc84 and S. pombe Sad1. Both SUN1 and SUN2 contain a
transmembrane region.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen with Trax (602964) as bait, Bray et al.
(2002) cloned Unc84a, which they designated Sun1, from a mouse testis
cDNA library. The deduced protein contains 310 amino acids. Overall the
mouse and human proteins share 75% homology, and they share 89% homology
in the C-terminal Sad1/Unc84 (SUN) domain. Northern blot analysis of
mouse tissues detected a 4.3-kb transcript in all tissues examined, with
highest levels in heart, brain, and testis, and a 2.5-kb transcript only
in testis. Northern blot analysis of isolated testicular germ cells
detected the 4.3-kb transcript in pachytene spermatocytes and the 2.5-kb
transcript primarily in postmeiotic cells. Unc84a transfected into
NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts showed 2 patterns of distribution. One pattern
was predominantly cytoplasmic with perinuclear accumulation, and the
other exhibited both nuclear and cytoplasmic staining, but no
accumulation in the nucleoli. Bray et al. (2002) noted that these
expression profiles may reflect regulation of expression during the cell
cycle, since the transfected cells were not synchronized.

By peptide mass fingerprint spectra, Dreger et al. (2001) identified
Unc84a in a TX100-resistant fraction of nuclear envelope proteins
isolated from a mouse neuroblastoma cell line. Mouse Unc84a contains a
C2H2 zinc finger domain and 3 to 4 putative transmembrane segments. The
apparent molecular mass of mouse Unc84a is about 100 kD. Indirect
immunofluorescence of transiently transfected COS-7 cells detected
Unc84a fluorescence in a rim-like pattern around the nucleus, typical
for integral inner nuclear membrane proteins.

By immunofluorescence analysis, Ding et al. (2007) found that the
distribution of Sun1 changed during development of mouse spermatids. In
primary spermatocytes, but not in round spermatids, Sun1 colocalized
with telomeres. Sun1 associated with chromosome ends from early
leptotene stage to diplotene stage, including homolog pairing, synapsis,
and desynapsis, but it was absent from telomeres during diakinesis.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis and in vitro binding assays, Bray et al.
(2002) determined that the C terminus of Unc84a interacts directly with
Trax.

Haque et al. (2010) stated that SUN1 and SUN2 interact with lamin A
(LMNA; 150330) and that LMNA is required for the nuclear envelope
localization of SUN2, but not SUN1. By immunoprecipitation of
transfected human osteosarcoma cells and mouse fibroblasts, followed by
in vitro pull-down assays and immunofluorescence microscopy, Haque et
al. (2010) identified emerin (EMD; 300384) and short isoforms of
nesprin-2 (SYNE2; 608442) as novel nucleoplasmic binding partners of
mouse Sun1 and human SUN2. Emerin and nesprin-2 had overlapping binding
sites, distinct from the LMNA-binding site, in Sun1 and SUN2. LMNA
mutations associated with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy-2 (EDMD2;
181350) and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS; 176670)
disrupted interaction of LMNA with Sun1 and SUN2. Nuclear localization
of SUN1 and SUN2 was not impaired in EDMD2 or HGPS cell lines.
Expression of SUN1, but not SUN2, at the nuclear envelope was enhanced
in some HGPS cells, likely due to increased interaction of SUN1 with
accumulated prelamin A. Haque et al. (2010) proposed that different
perturbations in LMNA-SUN protein interactions may underlie the opposing
effects of EDMD and HGPS mutations on nuclear and cellular mechanics.

Chen et al. (2012) showed that cells from Lmna -/- mice, which represent
EDMD2, cells from Lmna(L530P/L530P) mice, which represent HGPS, and
cells from HGPS patients all had overaccumulation of the inner nuclear
envelope SUN1 protein. In wildtype cells, Lmna and Sun1 colocalized at
the nuclear envelope. In Lmna -/- cells, larger amounts of Sun1 were
found at the nuclear envelope and also in the Golgi. The larger amounts
of Sun1 appeared to result from reduced protein turnover. Transfection
of increasing amounts of mouse Sun1 into Lmna-null/Sun1-null murine
cells resulted in increased prevalence of nuclear herniations and
apoptosis, and the herniations appeared to result from Sun1 accumulation
in the Golgi. Loss of the Sun1 gene in both mouse models extensively
rescued cellular, tissue, organ, and lifespan abnormalities. Similarly,
knockdown of overaccumulated SUN1 protein in primary human HGPS cells
corrected nuclear defects and cellular senescence. The findings
indicated that accumulation of SUN1 is a common pathogenetic event in
these disorders.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the UNC84A
gene to chromosome 7.

ANIMAL MODEL

Ding et al. (2007) obtained Sun1-null mouse embryos in the expected
mendelian ratio. Both male and female Sun1-null mice developed normally,
but they were sterile. Histologic examination showed that germ cells
were largely depleted in seminiferous tubules of Sun1-null mice.
Spermatids and spermatozoa were completely absent, and only abnormal
spermatocyte-like cells accumulated in some tubules. TUNEL staining
revealed that massive apoptosis accounted for the absence of spermatids
and spermatozoa in Sun1-null testis.

Lei et al. (2009) found that anchorage of skeletal muscle nuclei at
neuromuscular junctions was partially disrupted in Sun1-null mice, but
not in Sun2-null mice. Anchorage of nonsynaptic nuclei was normal in
both Sun1-null mice and Sun2-null mice. Sun1/Sun2 double-knockout mice
died soon after birth, with enhanced loss of synaptic nuclei, disrupted
organization of nonsynaptic nuclei, and mislocalization of Syne1 at
synaptic junctions. Disruption of 3 or all 4 wildtype Sun1 and Sun2
alleles revealed a gene dosage effect on synaptic nuclear anchorage. Lei
et al. (2009) concluded that SUN1 and SUN2 have partially redundant
functions on synaptic nuclear anchorage in skeletal muscle fibers.

Zhang et al. (2009) showed that Sun1 and Sun2 double-knockout (Sun1/2
DKO) mice and Syne1 and Syne2 double-knockout (Syne1/2 DKO) mice had
similar defects in brain development. Sun1/2 DKO and Syne1/2 DKO brains
were small and showed defective laminary structures in many brain
regions. Examination of neocortex revealed failure of radial neuronal
migration, but not tangential migration of interneurons, in both Sun1/2
DKO and Syne1/2 DKO mice. Intracellular movement of nuclei is a
prerequisite for proper neuron migration and development, and Zhang et
al. (2009) found that Sun1 and Sun2 anchored Syne2 to the nuclear
envelope, while Syne1 and Syne2 connected the nuclear envelope to the
microtubule network, permitting nuclear movement. Zhang et al. (2009)
concluded that a complex made up of SUN1, SUN2, SYNE1, and SYNE2 is
required for neuronal nuclear movement and for neuronal migration and
development.

611643	TITLE *611643 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN WITH KRAB AND SCAN DOMAINS 4; ZKSCAN4
;;ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 307; ZNF307
DESCRIPTION See 603971 for background information on zinc finger genes.

CLONING

Li et al. (2007) cloned the zinc finger gene ZKSCAN4, which they
designated ZNF307, from human embryonic heart cDNA. The deduced
545-amino acid protein, which is evolutionarily conserved, has a
calculated molecular mass of 61.6 kD. It contains a SCAN, or LER
(leucine-rich region), domain, a KRAB domain, and 7 C2H2 zinc finger
motifs. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.4-kb ZKSCAN4 transcript in
adult heart, brain, placenta, lung, and kidney, as well as in embryonic
(17-week) heart, brain, skeletal muscle, small intestine, and liver. An
EGFP-ZKSCAN4 fluorescent fusion construct showed that the protein
localizes to the nucleus.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a yeast 2-hybrid system, Li et al. (2007) found that ZKSCAN4 acts
as a transcriptional repressor. Further studies demonstrated that
full-length ZKSCAN4 suppressed p53 transcription (191170) and that this
effect was lessened by siRNA knockdown of ZKSCAN4 transcription. As
expected from the known interaction of p53 and p21 (190020), ZKSCAN4
suppressed p21 transcription, which was reversed with siRNA knockdown of
ZKSCAN4. Based on experiments showing that overexpression of ZKSCAN4
upregulated expression of the MDM2 (164785) and EP300 (602700) genes, Li
et al. (2007) proposed that ZKSCAN4 may suppress the p53-p21 pathway by
activating MDM2 and EP300 expression and by inducing degradation of p53
protein.

GENE STRUCTURE

Li et al. (2007) determined that the ZKSCAN4 gene contains 5 exons and
spans approximately 76.3 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Li et al. (2007) mapped the ZKSCAN4 gene
to chromosome 6p21.33-p21.31.

114051	TITLE *114051 CALBINDIN 2; CALB2
;;CALBINDIN, 29-KD;;
CALBINDIN D29K;;
CALRETININ
DESCRIPTION 
MAPPING

Using a genomic fragment containing exon 2 of the brain calcium-binding
protein, calbindin 29 kD, in the study of human/rodent somatic cell
hybrids, Parmentier et al. (1989) assigned the gene to chromosome 16.

Chen et al. (1991) mapped the CALB2 gene and 11 others to the long arm
of chromosome 16 by the use of 14 mouse/human hybrid cell lines and the
fragile site FRA16B. The CALB2 gene was found to be in the distal
portion of band 16q22.1, just proximal to HP (140100) and just distal to
NMOR1 (DIA4; 125860). By in situ hybridization, Parmentier et al. (1991)
mapped the CALB2 gene, called by them calretinin, to 16q22-q23.

GENE FUNCTION

Thirty percent of all cortical interneurons arise from a relatively
novel source within the ventral telencephalon, the caudal ganglionic
eminence (CGE) (summary by De Marco Garcia et al., 2011). Owing to their
late birth date, these interneurons populate the cortex only after the
majority of other interneurons and pyramidal cells are already in place
and have started to functionally integrate. De Marco Garcia et al.
(2011) demonstrated in mice that for CGE-derived reelin
(600514)-positive and calretinin-positive, but not vasoactive intestinal
peptide (VIP; 192320)-positive, interneurons, activity is essential
before postnatal day 3 for correct migration, and that after postnatal
day 3, glutamate-mediated activity controls the development of their
axons and dendrites. Furthermore, De Marco Garcia et al. (2011) showed
that the engulfment and cell motility-1 gene (Elmo1; 606420), a target
of the transcription factor distal-less homeobox-1 (Dlx1; 600029), is
selectively expressed in reelin-positive and calretinin-positive
interneurons and is both necessary and sufficient for activity-dependent
interneuron migration. De Marco Garcia et al. (2011) concluded that
their findings revealed a selective requirement for activity in shaping
the cortical integration of specific neuronal subtypes.

ANIMAL MODEL

Schiffmann et al. (1999) showed that Calb2-deficient mice were impaired
in tests of motor coordination. Impairment in intracellular calcium
concentration in the Calb2-deficient Purkinje cells was supported by the
high calcium saturation of calbindin-D28K (CALB1; 114050) in these
cells. The firing behavior of Purkinje cells was severely affected in
alert null mice, with alterations of simple spike firing rate, complex
spike duration, and simple spike pause. In contrast, transmission at
parallel fiber- or climbing fiber-Purkinje cell synapses was unaltered
in slices, indicating that marked modifications of firing behavior in
vivo can be undetectable in slice. The results were interpreted as
indicating that CALB2 plays a major role at the network level in
cerebellar physiology.

602618	TITLE *602618 C-TERMINAL-BINDING PROTEIN 1; CTBP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The E1a region of group C adenoviruses encodes 2 nearly identical
proteins that are largely responsible for the oncogenic properties of
adenoviruses. Whereas the N-terminal half of these E1A proteins is
sufficient for transformation, the C-terminal half appears to modulate
transformation, tumorigenesis, and metastasis negatively. Boyd et al.
(1993) purified a HeLa cell protein, designated CTBP1, that specifically
binds to the C-terminal half of E1A proteins. CTBP1 is a phosphoprotein
that migrates as a 48-kD doublet by SDS-PAGE. Katsanis and Fisher (1998)
suggested that the doublet consists of CTBP1 and the closely related
CTBP2 (602619).

Schaeper et al. (1995) independently isolated a CTBP1 cDNA from a B-cell
library. The predicted 439-amino acid sequence contains the sequences of
2 peptides prepared from purified CTBP1. The authors
coimmunoprecipitated CTPB1 and an E1A protein from extracts of mammalian
cells that were expressing both proteins.

Furusawa et al. (1999) identified the mouse homologs of CTBP1 and CTBP2
in a yeast 2-hybrid screen for proteins that interact with delta-EF1
(TCF8; 189909), a transcriptional repressor that binds the E2-box
(CACCTG) and related sequences. Using 2-hybrid and direct binding
assays, they concluded that CtBP1 binds to the short medial portion of
delta-EF1 containing the PLDLSL motif. In cotransfection experiments,
they observed that CtBP1 enhanced the transrepression activity of
delta-EF1. Using Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization with
mouse embryos, Furusawa et al. (1999) detected CtBP1 expression
throughout developmental stages and in a wide range of adult tissues.
CtBP1 and CtBP2 expression correlates with delta-EF1 expression. The
authors hypothesized that CtBP1 and CtBP2 function as corepressors of
delta-EF1 action.

GENE FUNCTION

Polycomb (Pc) is part of a Pc group (PcG) protein complex that is
involved in repression of gene activity during Drosophila and vertebrate
development. Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay, Sewalt et al. (1999) found
that Xenopus Ctbp1 interacts with Xenopus Pc and that human CTBP2
interacts with PC2 (603079), a human Pc homolog. Immunofluorescence
studies indicated that CTBP1 and CTBP2 partially colocalize with PC2 in
large PcG domains in interphase nuclei. As with PC2, chimeric LexA-CTBP2
and LexA-CTBP1 proteins repressed gene activity when targeted to a
reporter gene. Sewalt et al. (1999) suggested that PC2-mediated
repression of gene expression involves an association with corepressors
such as the CTBPs. They speculated that the interference of the
adenoviral E1A protein with the transcription machinery of the infected
cell may involve interference with PcG-mediated repression through
disruption of the CTBP-PcG interaction. Northern blot analysis revealed
that the CTBP1 gene was expressed as a 2.4-kb mRNA in all human tissues
tested.

Pc2 recruits the transcriptional corepressor CTBP to PcG bodies. Kagey
et al. (2003) showed that CTBP is sumoylated at a single lysine. In
vitro, CTBP sumoylation minimally required the SUMO E1 and E2 (UBC9;
601661) and SUMO1 (601912). However, Pc2 dramatically enhanced CTBP
sumoylation. The authors proposed that, in vivo, this is likely due to
the ability of Pc2 to recruit both CTBP and UBC9 to PcG bodies, thereby
bringing together substrate and E2 and stimulating the transfer of SUMO
to CTBP. These results demonstrated that Pc2 is a SUMO E3 and suggested
that PcG bodies may be sumoylation centers.

Zhang et al. (2002) demonstrated that CTBP binding to cellular and viral
transcriptional repressors is regulated by NAD+ and NADH, with NADH
being 2 to 3 orders of magnitude more effective. Levels of free nuclear
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides, determined using 2-photon
microscopy, corresponded to the levels required for half-maximal CTBP
binding and were considerably lower than those previously reported.
Agents capable of increasing NADH levels stimulated CTBP binding to its
partners in vivo and potentiated CTBP-mediated repression. Zhang et al.
(2002) proposed that this ability to detect changes in nuclear NAD+/NADH
ratio allows CTBP to serve as a redox sensor for transcription.

Kumar et al. (2002) reported biochemical and crystallographic studies
that revealed that CTBP1 is a functional dehydrogenase. In addition,
both a cofactor-dependent conformational change, with NAD+ and NADH
being equivalently effective, and the active site residues were linked
to the binding of the PXDLS consensus recognition motif on repressors,
such as E1A and RIP140 (602490). They concluded that CTBP1 is an
NAD(+)-regulated component of critical complexes for specific repression
events in cells.

CTBP is recruited to DNA by transcription factors that contain a PXDLS
motif. Shi et al. (2003) reported the identification of a CTBP complex
that contains the essential components for both gene targeting and
coordinated histone modifications, allowing for the effective repression
of genes targeted by CTBP. This complex has a molecular mass of about
1.3 to 1.5 million and contains CTBP1 and CTBP2 as well as G9A (604599),
EUHMT (607001), COREST (607675), HDAC1 (601241) and HDAC2 (605164),
NPAO, REBB1, ZNF217 (602967), and KIAA0222. Immunoprecipitation with G9A
antibodies brought down the same components as well as HPC2 (ELAC2;
605367). Shi et al. (2003) found that inhibiting the expression of CTBP
and its associated histone-modifying activities by RNA-interference
resulted in alterations of histone modifications at the promoter of the
tumor invasion suppressor gene E-cadherin (192090) and increased
promoter activity in a reporter assay.

By yeast 3-hybrid analysis, Zhang et al. (2003) found that mouse Hipk2
(606868) interacted with an E1A-Ctbp complex. Expression of Hipk2 or
exposure to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation reduced Ctbp levels via a
proteasome-mediated pathway. Coexpression of kinase-inactive Hipk2 or
small interfering RNA-mediated reduction in Hipk2 levels prevented the
UV effect. Mutation of Ctbp ser422 prevented phosphorylation as well as
UV- and Hipk2-directed Ctbp clearance. Deletion of Ctbp or reduction in
Ctbp levels promoted apoptosis in p53 (191170)-deficient cells.

Gallop et al. (2005) found that the lysophosphatidic acid
acyltransferase, or LPAAT, activity associated with CtBP/BARS (e.g.,
Weigert et al., 1999) is a copurification artifact.

Using a promoter pull-down assay followed by mass spectrometry analysis,
Flajollet et al. (2009) identified RREB1 (602209) as a protein that
bound the HLA-G (142871) promoter. RREB1 exerted repressive activity on
the promoter in HLA-G-negative cells that was mediated by recruitment of
HDAC1 and CTBP1 and/or CTBP2. The HLA-G promoter contains 3 RREB1 target
sites. Flajollet et al. (2009) proposed that the repressive activity of
RREB1 on the HLA-G promoter may be regulated by posttranslational
modifications governing its association with CTBP.

Deng et al. (2011) identified microRNA-137 (MIR137; 614304) as a
regulator of CTBP1 expression. Expression of MIR137 was inversely
correlated with that of CTBP1 in melanoma cell lines. The MIR137-binding
site in the 3-prime UTR of CTBP1 mRNA is conserved from human to
chicken. Pull-down assays revealed that MIR137 interacted with ARGO2
(EIF2C2; 606229) and CTBP1 mRNA. Cotransfection of MIR137 inhibited
expression of a reporter gene containing the CTBP1 3-prime UTR, but not
when the MIR137-binding site was deleted from the CTBP1 3-prime UTR.
Western blot and quantitative RT-PCR analyses showed that MIR137
expression in a melanoma cell line reduced CTBP1 protein levels and
increased expression of the CTBP1 target genes E-cadherin and BAX
(600040).

MAPPING

By PCR of a radiation hybrid panel, Katsanis and Fisher (1998) mapped
the CTBP1 gene to 4p16.

157129	TITLE *157129 MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1B; MAP1B
;;FUTSCH, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF; FUTSCH
DESCRIPTION Using a polyclonal antiserum directed against the C-terminal domain of
dystrophin, Lien et al. (1991) isolated a cDNA clone encoding an
antigenically cross-reactive protein, microtubule-associated protein 1B
(MAP1B). By in situ hybridization, the gene was mapped to 5q13 in
proximity to the spinal muscular atrophy (SMA; 253300) locus. Genetic
linkage analysis of SMA families using a human dinucleotide repeat
polymorphism just 3-prime of the MAP1B gene has shown tight linkage to
SMA mutations. These mapping data, together with the postulated role of
MAP1B in neuronal morphogenesis and its localization in anterior horn
motor neurons, suggest a possible association with SMA. The maximum lod
score between SMA and MAP1B for combined sexes was 20.24 at a
recombination fraction of 0.02. The 2 recombinants between MAP1B and SMA
might appear to eliminate the possibility of an etiologic relationship
between MAP1B and SMA. However, there is likely to be nonallelic
heterogeneity, particularly among chronic cases of SMA. If MAP1B were
indeed the SMA locus, it would be expected to be recombinant in families
that have mutations at another locus. MAP1B was found to be the closest
marker distal to the locus for SMA; its 5-prime end was oriented toward
the centromere (Wirth et al., 1993).

Hammarback et al. (1991) found that LC1, one of the 3 light chains that
makes up the MAP1B complex, is encoded within the 3-prime end of the
MAP1B heavy chain gene. Their data suggested that the heavy chain and
light chain 1 are produced by proteolytic processing of a precursor
polypeptide.

Lien et al. (1994) completely cloned and sequenced the human MAP1B gene.
The expressed protein showed 91% overall identity with rat and mouse
MAP1B. The gene has 7 exons; the third exon contains sequence not
represented in mouse or rat MAP1B. This sequence, labeled 3A, is present
at the 5-prime end of an alternative transcript that is expressed at
approximately one-tenth the level of the full-length transcript.

Neuronal microtubules are considered to have a role in dendrite and axon
formation. Different portions of the developing and adult brain
microtubules are associated with different microtubule-associated
proteins. MAP1B is expressed in different portions of the brain and may
have a role in neuronal plasticity and brain development. Edelmann et
al. (1996) generated mice that carry an insertion in MAP1B by gene
targeting methods. Mice homozygous for the modification died during
embryogenesis. The heterozygotes exhibited a spectrum of phenotypes
including slower growth rates, lack of visual acuity in one or both
eyes, and motor system abnormalities. Histochemical analysis of the
severely affected mice revealed that their Purkinje cell dendritic
processes were abnormal, did not react with MAP1B antibodies, and showed
reduced staining with MAP1A (600178) antibodies. Similar histologic and
immunochemical changes were observed in the olfactory bulb, hippocampus,
and retina, providing a basis for the observed phenotypes.

Zhang et al. (2001) developed a Drosophila model of fragile X syndrome
(300624) using loss-of-function mutants and overexpression of the FMR1
(309550) homolog, Dfxr (Drosophila fragile X-related gene). Dfxr nulls
displayed enlarged synaptic terminals, whereas neuronal overexpression
resulted in fewer and larger synaptic boutons. Synaptic structural
defects were accompanied by altered neurotransmission, with synapse
type-specific regulation in central and peripheral synapses. These
phenotypes mimicked those observed in mutants of Futsch, a
microtubule-associated protein with homology to mammalian MAP1B.
Immunoprecipitation of Dfxr showed association with Futsch mRNA, and
Western blot analyses demonstrated that Dfxr inversely regulates Futsch
expression. Dfxr-Futsch double mutants restored normal synaptic
structure and function. Zhang et al. (2001) proposed that Dfxr acts as a
translational repressor of Futsch to regulate microtubule-dependent
synaptic growth and function.

Allen et al. (2005) showed that gigaxonin (605379) controls protein
degradation and is essential for neuronal function and survival. They
presented evidence that gigaxonin binds to the ubiquitin-activating
enzyme E1 (314370) through its amino-terminal BTB domain, while the
carboxy-terminal kelch repeat domain interacts directly with the light
chain (LC) of MAP1B. Overexpression of gigaxonin led to enhanced
degradation of MAP1B-LC, which could be antagonized by proteasome
inhibitors. Ablation of gigaxonin caused a substantial accumulation of
MAP1B-LC in giant axonal neuropathy (GAN)-null neurons. Moreover, Allen
et al. (2005) showed that overexpression of MAP1B in wildtype cortical
neurons led to cell death characteristic of GAN-null neurons, whereas
reducing MAP1B levels significantly improved the survival rate of null
neurons. Allen et al. (2005) concluded that their results identified
gigaxonin as a ubiquitin scaffolding protein that controls MAP1B-LC
degradation and provided insight into the molecular mechanisms
underlying human neurodegenerative disorders.

;;DIACYLGLYCEROL KINASE, DELTA, 110-KD, FORMERLY; DAGK4, FORMERLY;;

DESCRIPTION See 125855 for a general discussion of the diacylglycerol kinases.

CLONING

Houssa et al. (1997) purified a 110-kD DGK, which they designated
DGK-theta, from rat brain cytosol. By PCR of a rat brain library with
primers based on the partial protein sequence, the authors isolated a
DGK-theta cDNA. They screened human fetal brain and retina libraries
with the rat cDNA and identified cDNAs encoding the human homolog. The
predicted 882-amino acid human protein is 90% identical to rat
DGK-theta. Sequence analysis revealed that DGK-theta contains a
pleckstrin homology domain and the conserved DGK putative catalytic
domain. However, unlike other DGK isotypes, DGK-theta contains 3 rather
than 2 cysteine-rich zinc-binding domains, an N-terminal proline- and
glycine-rich region, and a RAS (see 190020)-associating domain. Using
RT-PCR and in situ hybridization, Houssa et al. (1997) determined that
DGK-theta was expressed at the highest level in rat brain, especially in
the cerebellum and hippocampus. The human protein exhibited DGK activity
when expressed in mammalian cells.

In a systematic search for transcribed sequences located in the region
of the Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (194190) deletion, Endele et al. (1996)
used the exon amplification scheme to identify a sequence with complete
identity to that reported for human diacylglycerol kinase-4 by Houssa et
al. (1997). Endele et al. (1996) stated that expression of the DAGK4
protein is observed in the mammalian retina. Defects in eye-specific
DAGK genes cause retinal degeneration in Drosophila; thus, DAGK genes
are candidates for human eye disease. The Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome is
not associated with any form of retinopathy, and it remains to be shown
whether any other retinopathy maps to the 4p16.3 region. The authors
concluded that DAGK4 is probably not involved in the Wolf-Hirschhorn
syndrome phenotype.

MAPPING

The mouse Dgkq gene had been mapped to mouse chromosome 5 in a region
sharing homology of synteny with chromosome 4p16.3 (Kozak and
Stephenson, 1993).

Fathallah et al. (1993) reported the cloning of a human heat-shock
protein (hsp), which they designated hsp70 RY. The cDNA was isolated
from an EBV-transformed B-cell line from a patient with leukocyte
adhesion molecule deficiency. The predicted 701-amino acid protein has
an N-terminal ATP-binding domain and a C-terminal peptide-binding domain
characteristic of hsp proteins. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.0-kb
RNA in the patient's EBV cell line.

609358	TITLE *609358 ETS VARIANT GENE 2; ETV2
;;ETS-RELATED PROTEIN 71, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; ER71; ETSRP71
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Brown and McKnight (1992) cloned mouse Etv2, which they designated Er71.
The deduced protein contains 335 amino acids and may represent a partial
sequence. Northern blot analysis of several mouse tissues detected a
1.7-kb transcript in adult testis and a 1.2-kb transcript in whole
day-8.5 mouse embryos. No expression was detected in any other tissue
examined.

De Haro and Janknecht (2005) determined that mouse Etv2 has 2 alternate
translation start sites, resulting in proteins of 336 or 358 amino
acids. Northern blot analysis detected a major 1.7-kb transcript and a
minor 1.5-kb transcript in mouse testis. RT-PCR found highest Etv2
expression in Sertoli cells. By database analysis, De Haro and Janknecht
(2005) identified a cDNA for human ETV2. The deduced protein contains
370 amino acids. De Haro and Janknecht (2005) also identified a human
ETV2 cDNA isolated from adult medulla that lacks exon 2 and encodes a
truncated protein with only the last 249 amino acids of full-length
ETV2.

GENE FUNCTION

Brown and McKnight (1992) found that mouse Er71, like Gabpa (600609) and
Er81 (ETV1; 600541), recognized the pentanucleotide DNA sequence
5-prime-CGGAA/T-3-prime.

By electrophoretic mobility shift assay, De Haro and Janknecht (2005)
found that the 2 isoforms of mouse Etv2 bound to the MMP1 (120353)
promoter with equal affinity and showed comparable activation of a
reporter gene driven by the MMP1 promoter.

GENE STRUCTURE

De Haro and Janknecht (2005) determined that the mouse Etv2 gene
contains 7 exons and spans 3 kb. The promoter region has no TATA box,
but it has a functional Sp1 (189906)-binding site. The human ETV2 gene
also contains 7 exons.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the ETV2
gene to chromosome 19 (TMAP stSG50872).

De Haro and Janknecht (2005) mapped the mouse Etv2 gene to chromosome
7A3 in a region that shows homology of synteny to human chromosome
19q13.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PIK3) activity is implicated in diverse
cellular responses triggered by mammalian cell surface receptors.
Stoyanov et al. (1995) noted that receptors with tyrosine kinase
activity recruit heterodimeric PIK3 kinases composed of a p110 catalytic
subunit and a p85 adaptor subunit (171833). Stoyanov et al. (1995)
screened a human bone marrow cDNA library with primers based on the
sequences of yeast and bovine PIK3 p110 subunits. They isolated a human
cDNA for a novel p110 subunit, which they termed p110-gamma. The cDNA
encodes a predicted 120-kD, 1,050-amino acid polypeptide with 36%
identity to human p110-alpha (171834). The 5.3-kb p110-alpha transcript
was detectable by Northern blot in human pancreas, skeletal muscle,
liver, and heart.

GENE FUNCTION

Stoyanov et al. (1995) found that recombinant p110-gamma did not
interact with the p85 subunit in vivo, in contrast to recombinant
p110-alpha. The transducin G protein subunits G-beta(t)
(139380)/G-gamma(t) (189970) did, however, activate p110-gamma in vitro,
and the stimulation was suppressed by G-alpha(t)-GDP (139330);
G-alpha(t)-GDP could stimulate p110-gamma only in the presence of
AlF(4-). In contrast, the p85-dependent p110-alpha was not similarly
affected by the G protein subunits. Stoyanov et al. (1995) speculated
that the p110-gamma isotype may link signaling through G protein-coupled
receptors and generate phosphoinositide second messengers phosphorylated
in the D-3 position.

Target ligation in natural killer (NK) cells activates a Ras
(190070)-independent ERK (see ERK2; 176948) pathway that leads to NK
lytic function, i.e., the movement and release of perforin (170280) or
granzyme B (GZMB; 123910) to target cells. Using gene manipulation and
specific inhibitors of PI3K and MEK (see MAP2K1; 176872), Jiang et al.
(2000) delineated a specific pathway, PI3K--RAC1 (602048)--PAK1
(602590)--MEK--ERK, in NK cells that affects lysis. Thus, PI3K plays a
pivotal role in the regulation of cytotoxicity in NK cells.

Sasaki et al. (2000) found that in humans p110-gamma protein expression
was lost in primary colorectal adenocarcinomas from patients and in
colon cancer cell lines. Overexpression of wildtype or kinase-dead
p110-gamma in human colon cancer cells with mutations of the tumor
suppressors APC (611731) and p53 (191170), or the oncogenes beta-catenin
(116806) and Ki-ras, suppressed tumorigenesis. Thus, p110-gamma can
block the growth of human colon cancer cells.

Niswender et al. (2001) demonstrated that systemic administration of
leptin (164160) in rat activates the enzyme
phosphatidylinositol-3-hydroxykinase in the hypothalamus and that
intracerebroventricular infusion of inhibitors of this enzyme prevents
leptin-induced anorexia. They concluded that
phosphatidylinositol-3-hydroxykinase is a crucial enzyme in the signal
transduction pathway that links hypothalamic leptin to reduced food
intake.

Brock et al. (2003) showed that fluorescence-tagged porcine p101
(PIK3R5; 611317) and human p110-gamma interacted in transfected human
embryonic kidney cells and retained the essential functions of wildtype
heterodimeric PI3K-gamma. G protein-beta (see GNB1; 139380)-gamma (see
GNG2; 606981) recruited PI3K-gamma from the cytosol to the membrane
through interaction with the p101 subunit. Accordingly, p101 was
required for G protein-mediated activation of PI3K-gamma.
Membrane-targeted p110-gamma displayed basal enzymatic activity, but it
was further stimulated by G-beta-gamma, even in the absence of p101.
Brock et al. (2003) concluded that the noncatalytic p101 subunit of
PI3K-gamma is an adaptor molecule that recruits the catalytic subunit to
the plasma membrane through high-affinity interaction with G-beta-gamma.
In turn, direct interaction between G-beta-gamma and membrane-attached
p110-gamma contributes to final activation of the enzyme by a mechanism
other than translocation.

Zhao et al. (2006) showed that electric fields, of a strength equal to
those detected endogenously, direct cell migration during wound healing
as a prime directional cue. Manipulation of endogenous wound electric
fields affects wound healing in vivo. Electric stimulation triggers
activation of Src and inositol-phospholipid signaling, which polarizes
in the direction of cell migration. Notably, genetic disruption of
PIK3CG decreased electric field-induced signaling and abolished directed
movements of healing epithelium in response to electric signals.
Deletion of the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN;
601728) enhanced signaling and electrotactic responses. Zhao et al.
(2006) concluded that their data identified genes essential for
electrical signal-induced wound healing and showed that PIK3CG and PTEN
control electrotaxis.

Hawkins and Stephens (2007) gave a review of PI3K-gamma function.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kratz et al. (2002) determined that the PIK3CG gene contains 10 exons
and spans approximately 37 kb of genomic DNA.

MAPPING

By FISH, Sasaki et al. (2000) mapped the PIK3CG gene to 7q22.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Kratz et al. (2002) evaluated the PIK3CG gene as a candidate myeloid
tumor suppressor gene. By FISH, they assigned the gene to a commonly
deleted segment defined previously in myeloid leukemias with breakpoints
within 7q22. Forty leukemias with monosomy 7 or a del(7q) were screened
for PIK3CG mutations. Two patients had missense variations affecting
residue 859 in the N-terminal catalytic domain of the protein. This
allele was also detected in unaffected parents and in 1 of 60 control
alleles; it probably represents a polymorphism. Kratz et al. (2002)
concluded that PIK3CG is unlikely to act as a recessive tumor suppressor
gene in myeloid leukemias with monosomy 7.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hirsch et al. (2000), Sasaki et al. (2000), and Li et al. (2000) each
independently developed mice deficient in PI3K-gamma by targeted
disruption. PI3K-gamma -/- mice were viable and had fully differentiated
neutrophils and macrophages. Chemoattractant-stimulated PI3K-gamma -/-
neutrophils did not produce phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate, did
not activate protein kinase B, and displayed impaired respiratory burst
and motility. Peritoneal PI3K-gamma-null macrophages showed a reduced
migration toward a wide range of chemotactic stimuli and a severely
defective accumulation in a septic peritonitis model, as shown by Hirsch
et al. (2000). These results demonstrated that PI3K-gamma is a crucial
signaling molecule required for macrophage accumulation in inflammation.
Sasaki et al. (2000) demonstrated that PI3K-gamma controls thymocyte
survival and activation of mature T cells, but has no role in the
development or function of B cells. PI3K-gamma-deficient neutrophils
exhibited severe defects in migration and respiratory burst in response
to G protein-coupled receptor agonists and chemotactic agents.
PI3K-gamma links G protein-coupled receptor stimulation to the formation
of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate and the activation of protein
kinase B, ribosomal protein S6 kinase (see 608938), and extracellular
signal-regulated kinases 1 (601795) and 2. Thus, Sasaki et al. (2000)
concluded that PI3K-gamma regulates thymocyte development, T-cell
activation, neutrophil migration, and the oxidative burst. Li et al.
(2000) reported similar results and also found that PI3K-gamma has an
important role in chemoattractant-induced superoxide production and
chemotaxis and in the production of T cell-independent antigen-specific
antibodies composed of the immunoglobulin-gamma light chain.

Sasaki et al. (2000) reported that genetic inactivation of the
p110-gamma catalytic subunit of PI3K-gamma leads to the development of
invasive colorectal adenocarcinomas in mice. However, in an erratum,
they stated that additional experiments with mice showed that
inactivation of this subunit 'does not in itself cause colon cancer, but
may require additional factors.' Barbier et al. (2001) analyzed tissue
biopsies from more than 100 PI3K-gamma-null mice at various ages and of
both sexes from 2 genetic backgrounds (129/SV inbred and C57BL/SJ/129
outbred) and demonstrated no malignant transformation. They concluded
that their findings were consistent with a lack of tumorigenesis in
PI3K-gamma-null strains generated by 3 of 4 strategies.

Crackower et al. (2002) showed that cardiomyocyte-specific inactivation
of Pten (601728) in mice resulted in hypertrophy and, unexpectedly, a
dramatic decrease in cardiac contractility. Analysis of Pten/Pi3k-gamma
double-mutant mice revealed that the cardiac hypertrophy and
contractility defects could be genetically uncoupled. Pi3k-alpha was
found to mediate the alteration in cell size, whereas Pi3k-gamma was
found to act as a negative regulator of cardiac contractility.
Mechanistically, Pi3k-gamma inhibited cAMP production, and
hypercontractility could be reverted by blocking cAMP function. These
data showed that PTEN has an important in vivo role in cardiomyocyte
hypertrophy and G protein-coupled receptor signaling and identified a
function for the PTEN-PI3K-gamma pathway in the modulation of heart
muscle contractility.

Oudit et al. (2003) infused isoproterenol into Pi3k-gamma-null mice and
found that the null mice had an attenuated cardiac hypertrophic response
and markedly reduced interstitial fibrosis compared to controls. Chronic
beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation triggered impaired heart functions
in wildtype mice, whereas Pi3k-gamma-null mice retained their increased
heart function and did not develop heart failure. Oudit et al. (2003)
concluded that PI3K-gamma is critical for the induction of hypertrophy,
fibrosis, and cardiac dysfunction in response to beta-adrenergic
receptor stimulation in vivo.

By selective inactivation of Pten in mouse B lymphocytes and
immunohistochemical analysis, Anzelon et al. (2003) detected a selective
expansion of marginal zone (MZ) B and B1 cells. Pten-deficient B cells
were hyperproliferative in response to mitogenic stimuli and had a lower
threshold for activation through the B lymphocyte antigen receptor.
Inactivation of Pten rescued germinal center, MZ B, and B1 cell
formation in Cd19 (107265) -/- mice, which exhibit reduced activation of
PI3K. Anzelon et al. (2003) concluded that intracellular
phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate has a central role in the
regulation of differentiation of peripheral B-cell subsets.

Patrucco et al. (2004) reported that mice carrying a targeted mutation
in the Pik3cg gene causing loss of kinase activity (Pik3cg KD/KD)
displayed reduced inflammatory reactions but no alterations in cardiac
contractility. cAMP levels were normal in Pik3cg KD/KD hearts, and
Pik3cg-deficient mice, but not Pik3cg KD/KD mice, developed dramatic
myocardial damage after chronic pressure overload induced by transverse
aortic constriction. Furthermore, the data indicated that PIK3CG is an
essential component of a complex controlling PDE3B (602047)
phosphodiesterase-mediated cAMP destruction. Patrucco et al. (2004)
concluded that cardiac PIK3CG participates in 2 distinct signaling
pathways: a kinase-dependent activity that controls PKB/AKT (see
164730), as well as MAPK phosphorylation, and contributes to transverse
aortic constriction-induced cardiac remodeling, and a kinase-independent
activity that relies on protein interactions to regulate PDE3B activity
and negatively modulates cardiac contractility.

Camps et al. (2005) used structure-based drug design to develop a potent
small molecule inhibitor of PIK3CG (referred to as AS-605240). Camps et
al. (2005) found that Pik3cg-null mice were protected against arthritis
induced by collagen II-specific antibodies, a murine model of
lymphocyte-independent rheumatoid arthritis (180300) associated with
neutrophil activation. The effect was associated with impaired
neutrophil chemotaxis. Treatment of wildtype mice with oral AS-605420
resulted in reduced clinical and histologic signs of collagen
II-antibody-induced arthritis, similar to that seen in the Pik3cg-null
mice. Oral AS-605240 also resulted in decreased joint inflammation and
damage in a distinct mouse model of lymphocyte-dependent rheumatoid
arthritis induced by direct collagen II injection. Camps et al. (2005)
concluded that PIK3CG inhibition operates on both the neutrophil and
lymphocyte arms of chemokine signaling pathways, and thus may be of
therapeutic value in various chronic inflammatory diseases.

In the MRL-lpr mouse model of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE;
152700), Barber et al. (2005) found that intraperitoneal administration
of the pharmacologic PIK3CG inhibitor AS-605240 reduced CD4+ T-cell
populations, reduced glomerulonephritis, and prolonged life span.

610257	TITLE *610257 SEC31, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF, A; SEC31A
;;SEC31-LIKE 1; SEC31L1;;
KIAA0905
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SEC31A is a subunit of coat protein complex II (COPII)-coated vesicles,
which are essential for secretion (Jin et al., 2012).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned SEC31L1, which they designated
KIAA0905. The deduced protein contains 1,220 amino acids. RT-PCR
detected moderate expression in all adult and fetal tissues and specific
brain regions examined.

By searching EST databases for sequences similar to yeast Sec31,
followed by screening a pancreas cDNA library, Tang et al. (2000) cloned
SEC31L1, which they called SEC31A. The deduced 1,218-amino acid protein
shares 25.8% identity with yeast Sec31. It contains 5 WD40 or WD40-like
repeats at its N terminus and a proline-rich region in its C-terminal
half. Northern blot analysis detected a 4-kb transcript that was
abundantly and ubiquitously expressed. In rat kidney cells, Sec31a
colocalized with Sec13 (SEC13L1; 600152) in vesicular-tubular structures
characteristic of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit sites.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunostaining for Sec31a in intact and permeabilized rat kidney
cells, Tang et al. (2000) found that Sec31a was not tightly associated
with the membrane. Binding of Sec31a to specific membrane structures was
restored by incubating washed cells with cytosol, indicating that Sec31a
was recruited to membranes. The membrane association of Sec31a was
greatly enhanced in the presence of a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog. Tang
et al. (2000) demonstrated that Sec31A and Sec13 coimmunoprecipitated
and that the proteins existed in a 600- to 700-kD complex.
Immunodepletion studies showed that rat Sec31a was required for
ER-to-Golgi vesicular transport.

Jin et al. (2012) found that monoubiquitination of Sec31 in mouse
embryonic stem cells by Klhl12 (614522) and the Cul3 (603136) E3
ubiquitin ligase complex was required for COPII vesicle expansion to
accommodate large cargo proteins, such as procollagens (see 120150). A
Sec31-binding mutant of Klhl12 neither colocalized with Sec31 at
intracellular vesicles nor induced formation of large vesicles.
Disruption of KLHL12-CUL3 function in human HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells
impaired COPII vesicle expansion and collagen export, but it had no
effect on export of smaller cargo by small COPII vesicles. Jin et al.
(2012) concluded that KLHL12-CUL3 monoubiquitination of SEC31 is
required for COPII vesicle expansion to accommodate large or bulky cargo
molecules.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the SEC31L1
gene to chromosome 4.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

DeMartino et al. (1991) cloned a partial cDNA encoding the PSMB6
subunit, termed 'subunit delta.' Akiyama et al. (1994) cloned the
full-length cDNA, which encoded a 239-amino acid polypeptide. The amino
acid sequence has significant homology to other proteasome beta
subunits. See PSMB5 (600306).

GENE FUNCTION

Coux et al. (1996) reviewed the structures and functions of the 20S
proteasome subunits. The beta subunits are believed to form the inner
rings of the proteasome and to mediate proteolysis.

MAPPING

Belich et al. (1994) mapped the PSMB6 gene to 17p13 by fluorescence in
situ hybridization.

601301	TITLE *601301 PEPTIDYL-PROLYL ISOMERASE-LIKE 1; PPIL1
;;CYCLOPHILIN-RELATED GENE 1; CYPL1
DESCRIPTION Cyclophilin (see 123840), first identified as a protein with high
binding affinity for the immunosuppressive agent cyclosporin A, is one
of the most effective therapeutic agents for prevention of graft
rejection after organ transplantation.

CLONING

Ozaki et al. (1996) isolated a human cDNA clone encoding a protein
homologous to cyclophilins and showed that it is conserved in species
ranging from human to prokaryotes. This cDNA contained an open reading
frame of 498 nucleotides encoding a polypeptide of 166 amino acids. The
predicted amino acid sequence had 41.6% homology to the human
cyclophilins. Northern blot analysis indicated ubiquitous expression in
adult human tissues, with the most abundant expression in heart and
skeletal muscle.

MAPPING

Ozaki et al. (1996) localized the PPIL1 gene to 2p23.3-p23.1 by FISH.
However, Mann et al. (1998) assigned the PPIL1 gene to 6p21.1 by FISH
and radiation hybrid mapping.

188450	TITLE *188450 THYROGLOBULIN; TG
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Thyroglobulin is the glycoprotein precursor to the thyroid hormones T3
(triiodothyronine) and T4 (tetraiodothyronine). It has a molecular mass
of 660 kD, with 2 identical subunits, yet its complete hydrolysis yields
only 2 to 4 molecules of T3 and T4. The protein contains a 19-amino acid
signal peptide followed by 2,748 residues. Its sequence is 77% similar
to that of the bovine protein (review by Dumont et al., 1989).

GENE STRUCTURE

Baas et al. (1986) found that the TG gene encodes an 8.7-kb mRNA, covers
at least 300 kb of genomic DNA, and contains at least 37 exons separated
by introns as large as 64 kb. A striking structural difference between
the 5-prime and 3-prime parts of the gene suggested that it is composed
of 2 evolutionarily different regions. The first 30 kb of DNA encodes 3
kb of the mRNA yielding an exon:intron ratio of 1:10, whereas the
remaining 270 kb encodes 5.7 kb of the mRNA with a ratio of 1:47.

Malthiery and Lissitzky (1987) deduced the primary structure of
thyroglobulin from the sequence of its 8,448-base cDNA.

Park and Chatterjee (2005) stated that the TG gene contains 42 coding
exons, each about 200 bp except for exons 9 and 10, which contain 1101
and 588 bp, respectively. Vono-Toniolo et al. (2005) noted that the TG
gene comprises 48 exons separated by introns of up to 65 kb.

MAPPING

Van Ommen et al. (1984) mapped the TG gene to chromosome 8 by use of a
DNA probe in somatic cell hybrids.

By in situ hybridization and use of a (3)H-labeled recombinant plasmid
DNA containing a 2.3-kb fragment of the thyroglobulin gene,
Berge-Lefranc et al. (1985) mapped the gene to 8q24.2-q24.3.

By in situ hybridization, Avvedimento et al. (1985) assigned TG to 8q23
or 8q24 and Baas et al. (1985) mapped it to 8q24. Analysis of hybrids
derived from a Burkitt lymphoma with a translocation breakpoint in the
MYC oncogene showed that TG is distal to MYC. Furthermore, the discovery
of 2 high frequency RFLPs in the 5-prime part of the TG gene results in
heterozygosity for at least 1 marker in 8q24 in 50% of a Caucasian
population.

Brocas et al. (1985) separated human chromosomes by a dual laser FACS
sorter and hybridized their DNA with a thyroglobulin gene probe. Thus
they assigned the TG gene to human chromosome 8. By study of rat-mouse
hybrid cells, they assigned the TG gene to rat chromosome 7, which is
known to carry the MYC gene. Hence, homology of synteny for TG and MYC
has been maintained between rat and man. Landegent et al. (1985) used a
nonradioactive label for in situ hybridization and confirmation of the
assignment. The procedure used 2-acetylaminofluorene-modified probes,
immunoperoxidase cytochemistry and reflection-contrast microscopy.
Nonradioactive labels such as fluorochromes, cytochemically detectable
enzymes, and electron-dense markers have advantages of speed of
performance and topolotic resolution.

GENE FUNCTION

Dumont et al. (1989) noted that thyroglobulin provides 3 things: a
thyroid hormone precursor, storage of iodine, and storage of inactive
thyroid hormones.

Lazar et al. (1999) studied the expression of 4 thyroid-specific genes,
the sodium-iodide symporter (NIS, or SLC5A5; 601843), thyroid peroxidase
(TPO; 606765), TG, and thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR;
603372), as well as the gene encoding glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1, or
SLC2A1; 138140), in 90 human thyroid tissues. mRNAs were extracted from
43 thyroid carcinomas (38 papillary and 5 follicular), 24 cold adenomas,
5 Graves disease (GRD; 275000) thyroid tissues, 8 toxic adenomas, and 5
hyperplastic thyroid tissues; 5 normal thyroid tissues were used as
reference. A kinetic quantitative PCR method, based on the fluorescent
TaqMan methodology and real-time measurement of fluorescence, was used.
NIS expression was decreased in 40 of 43 (93%) thyroid carcinomas and in
20 of 24 (83%) cold adenomas; it was increased in toxic adenomas and
Graves thyroid tissues. TPO expression was decreased in thyroid
carcinomas but was normal in cold adenomas; it was increased in toxic
adenomas and Graves thyroid tissues. TG expression was decreased in
thyroid carcinomas but was normal in the other tissues. TSHR expression
was normal in most tissues studied and was decreased in only some
thyroid carcinomas. In thyroid cancer tissues, a positive relationship
was found between the individual levels of expression of NIS, TPO, TG,
and TSHR. No relationship was found with the age of the patient. Higher
tumor stages (stages greater than I vs stage I) were associated with
lower expression of NIS and TPO. Expression of the GLUT1 gene was
increased in 1 of 24 (4%) adenomas and in 8 of 43 (19%) thyroid
carcinomas. In 6 thyroid carcinoma patients, 131-I uptake was studied in
vivo. NIS expression was low in all samples, and 3 patients with normal
GLUT1 expression had 131-I uptake in metastases, whereas the other 3
patients with increased GLUT1 gene expression had no detectable 131-I
uptake. The authors concluded that (1) reduced NIS gene expression
occurs in most hypofunctioning benign and malignant thyroid tumors; (2)
there is differential regulation of the expression of thyroid-specific
genes; and (3) an increased expression of GLUT1 in some malignant tumors
may suggest a role for glucose-derivative tracers to detect in vivo
thyroid cancer metastases by positron-emission tomography scanning.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Thyroid Dyshormonogenesis 3

Ieiri et al. (1991) gave the first report of individuals with documented
TG gene mutations (see 188450.0001 and TDH3, 274700).

Targovnik et al. (1989) provided the original description of a Brazilian
family in which 3 mutations in 2 compound heterozygous combinations were
found to segregate with the disorder (Gutnisky et al., 2004) (see
188450.0013).

Vono-Toniolo et al. (2005) reviewed naturally occurring mutations in the
thyroglobulin gene. They stated that in most instances affected
individuals have related parents and are homozygous for inactivating
mutations in the TG gene. More rarely, compound heterozygous mutations
lead to a loss of function of both alleles. Molecular analyses indicated
that at least some of these alterations result in a secretory defect and
an endoplasmic reticulum storage disease.

Kitanaka et al. (2006) reported a Japanese girl with congenital goitrous
hypothyroidism who was compound heterozygous for 2 mutations in the TG
gene (188450.0017-188450.0018). She was identified with increased TSH in
a neonatal screening test. Although serum T4 was low and serum TG
undetectable, serum T3 was increased.

In 2 brothers with recurrent large goiters, 1 of whom developed
metastatic follicular thyroid carcinoma (see 188470), Alzahrani et al.
(2006) analyzed the TG gene and identified homozygosity for a splice
site mutation (188450.0018). Alzahrani et al. (2006) also screened for
RAS oncogene mutations by direct sequencing of thyroid tumor DNA, but
identified no mutation in codons 12, 13, and 61 of the HRAS (190020),
KRAS (190070), and NRAS (164790) oncogenes. The authors concluded that
the malignant transformation of the congenital goiter was likely the
result of prolonged TSH stimulation, probably in combination with
mutations of oncogenes and/or tumor suppressor genes other than RAS.

Kanou et al. (2007) measured iodothyronine deiodinase type II (DIO2;
601413) in the thyroid gland of several patients with goiter who had
mutations in the TG gene that cause a defect in the intracellular
transport of TG (e.g., 188450.0005 and 188450.0015). They found a
positive correlation between DIO2 activity and free T3/T4 ratios.

- Autoimmune Thyroid Disease 3

The 8q24 region to which the thyroglobulin gene maps was shown to be
strongly linked with autoimmune thyroid disease (see AITD3, 608175). Ban
et al. (2003) sequenced all 48 exons of the TG gene and identified 14
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Case-control association studies
demonstrated that an exon 10-12 SNP cluster and an exon 33 SNP (R290W;
188450.0008) were significantly associated with AITD (p less than 0.01).
Haplotype analysis demonstrated that the combination of these 2 SNP
groups was more significantly associated with AITD (p less than 0.001).
Gene-gene interaction studies provided evidence for an interaction
between HLA-DR3 and the exon 33 SNP, giving an odds ratio of 6.1 for
Graves disease. The finding of a unique SNP haplotype at exons 10 and 12
of the mouse Tg gene led Ban et al. (2003) to conclude that TG is a
susceptibility gene for AITD both in humans and in mice.

In a study of 1,214 Caucasian patients in the United Kingdom with AITD
(960 with Graves disease and 254 with autoimmune hypothyroidism)
examining the same SNPs in the TG gene as those studied by Ban et al.
(2003), Collins et al. (2004) found no evidence for association of these
DNA variants with AITD. Collins et al. (2004) stated that their study
was the largest case-control association study to that time, and
concluded that while they could not exclude the TG region as harboring a
susceptibility locus for AITD, the SNPs in exons 10, 12, and 33 do not
have a causal role for AITD in the United Kingdom.

Hsiao et al. (2007) investigated the same TG SNPs in exons 10, 12, and
33 in 215 Taiwanese patients with Graves disease and 141 controls. Both
GD patients and controls had similar allele frequencies and genotype
distributions for the SNPs in exons 10 and 12, but there was a
significant increase in the T/T genotype in the exon 33 SNP in patients
compared with controls (p less than 0.001). In GD patients, the C/C
genotype was strongly associated with a subgroup of GD patients who were
likely to have a higher relapse rate, persistent positive TSH-receptor
antibodies after treatment, and a higher frequency of smoking and
ophthalmopathy (p less than 0.05).

Stefan et al. (2011) identified a -1623A-G SNP (188450.0019; dbSNP
rs180195) in the promoter region of the TG gene that modified a binding
site for IRF1 (147575) and predisposed to AITD. By genotyping 271
Caucasian patients with AITD (201 with Graves disease and 70 with
Hashimoto thyroiditis) and 165 matched controls, they found a
significant increase in the frequency of the G allele (p = 0.006) and
the GG genotype (p = 0.03; odds ratio = 1.6) in AITD patients compared
with controls. Stefan et al. (2011) confirmed the association in a
cohort of 102 multiplex families. Database analysis revealed that dbSNP
rs180195 lies within a putative binding motif for IRF1 or ETS1 (164720),
and that the AITD-associated G allele is conserved in vertebrates,
whereas the protective A allele is unique to humans. Cell culture and in
vitro assays revealed that IRF1 bound the TG promoter with the G allele
at the dbSNP rs180195 site and activated transcription of a reporter
gene. Binding of IRF1 correlated with histone markers of active
chromatin. IRF1 did not activate transcription from the A allele. Stefan
et al. (2011) concluded that the disease-associated variant of TG
defines an active enhancer element.

ANIMAL MODEL

By linkage studies, Beamer et al. (1987) showed that congenital goiter
(cog), a new autosomal recessive mutation in mice, maps to the central
region of mouse chromosome 15. The mice were found to be markedly
deficient in glandular immunoreactive thyroglobulin. The authors
concluded that the primary defect is in the synthesis or processing of
thyroglobulin. Since the Myc gene (190080) in the mouse is in the same
region of chromosome 15, it seems very likely that the structural gene
for thyroglobulin is affected in the cog mutation.

Taylor and Rowe (1987) and Adkison et al. (1990) indeed demonstrated
that the recessive mutation cog is located in the thyroglobulin (Tg)
gene. It appeared that there was no large deletion of the gene in this
mutation, and there were no obvious qualitative or quantitative
differences between mutant and abnormal thyroglobulin mRNA. The
thyroglobulin locus, which they symbolized Tgn in the mouse, mapped near
the glutamic-pyruvic transaminase isoenzyme locus Gpt1.

The hereditary goiter of Afrikander cattle is an autosomal recessive
disease characterized in homozygotes by the production of abnormal TG
and the coexistence in the thyroid of normal-sized 8.4-kb TG mRNA and a
misspliced 7.3-kb message missing exon 9 (Ricketts et al., 1985).
Ricketts et al. (1987) cloned and sequenced the cDNA segment
corresponding to the abnormal exon 8-exon 10 junction and the relevant
genomic DNA region. The mutation responsible for the disease is a
cytosine-to-thymine transition creating a stop codon at position 697 in
exon 9. The original reading frame is maintained in the 7.3-kb mRNA
which, as it lacks the mutated exon, is translatable into a potentially
functional protein. The mutation occurred in a CpG sequence. Ricketts et
al. (1987) suggested that in view of the high mutability of CpG
dinucleotides and considering that the segment involved is perfectly
conserved in human TG, an analogous mutation may be responsible for some
hereditary goiters in man.

Kok et al. (1987) used a RFLP of the thyroglobulin gene to confirm the
recessive inheritance of the goiter in Dutch goats. Heterozygous animals
showed no abnormality but could be identified by the RFLP studies.

Newly synthesized thyroglobulin folds and homodimerizes in the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) before its export to the site of iodination,
where it serves as the precursor for thyroid hormone synthesis. In
families with defective Tg export, affected individuals suffer from a
thyroidal ER storage disease characterized by a distended thyrocyte ER
containing misfolded Tg, along with induced ER molecular chaperones.
Inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, deficient Tg causes
congenital hypothyroidism in newborns that, if untreated, results in
goiter along with serious cognitive and growth defects. Studying the
molecular basis of a similar phenotype in the cog/cog mouse, Kim et al.
(1998) isolated and cloned a full-length 8.5-kb Tg cDNA from cog/cog
mice and unaffected isogenic AKR/J mice. Comparison of the complete
sequences revealed that cog/cog mice have a leu2263-to-pro missense
mutation in the acetylcholinesterase homology domain of Tg. Heterologous
expression studies in COS cells indicated that cog Tg exhibits a severe
defect in exit from the ER. Site-directed mutagenesis of cog Tg to
convert the single amino acid back to leu2263 restored normal Tg
secretion. Kim et al. (1998) concluded that the cog mutation in
thyroglobulin is responsible for this ER storage disease that causes
thyroid dyshormonogenesis.

Kim et al. (2000) studied the mutation in the WIC-rdw rat, which was
established from a closed colony of Wistar-Imamichi rats as a
spontaneous mutant exhibiting congenital dwarfism. Genetic linkage
analysis revealed that the rdw locus was mapped to rat chromosome 7 and
was identical to the Tg gene locus. Moreover, the Tg protein level was
reduced in the WIC-rdw thyroid, despite a similar level of the Tg gene
transcripts that were indistinguishable in their size from the normal.
Sequencing of the rdw and the normal rat Tg cDNAs revealed a single
nucleotide change, G6958C, resulting in a G2320R missense mutation in a
highly conserved region of the Tg molecule. Transient expression of the
intact Tg cDNA containing the rdw mutation in COS-7 cells showed no
detectable Tg in the secreted media, indicating a severe defect in the
export of the mutant Tg.

Ban et al. (2003) sequenced exons 10, 12, and 33 of the mouse Tg gene in
19 strains of mice. In 50% of the strains susceptible to thyroiditis,
they found a unique SNP haplotype at exons 10 and 12, whereas none of
the mouse strains that were resistant to thyroiditis had this SNP
haplotype (p = 0.01). They concluded that TG is a susceptibility gene
for autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD3; see 608175), both in humans and
in mice.

HISTORY

Van Ommen (1987) suggested that defects in the TG gene can cause either
dominant or recessive disorders depending on the nature of the defect.
When the gene is absent or at least when no thyroglobulin is
synthesized, the disorder is likely to be recessive, whereas the
presence of an abnormal subunit leads to a dominantly inherited
disorder. The explanation for this is that in a dimeric protein such as
thyroglobulin, 75% of the dimers in heterozygotes will contain 1 or more
abnormal subunits. This should profoundly disturb thyroglobulin
metabolism, since this protein fulfills a dual storage/catalytic role as
a dimer, is present in bulk quantities (100 mg Tg/g thyroid mass), and
needs to be exocytosed, iodinated, endocytosed, and degraded.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
THYROID DYSHORMONOGENESIS 3
TG, IVS3, C-G, -3

In a family in which 3 of 6 sibs had goiter and hypothyroidism (TDH3;
274700) and the parents were cousins, Cochaux et al. (1991) demonstrated
that the affected sibs had received the same alleles of a TG RFLP from
the parents and were therefore homozygous for the RFLP. Northern blot
analysis showed that whereas the amount of thyroglobulin mRNA was
normal, its size seemed slightly reduced. Further studies of genomic DNA
demonstrated that exon 4 was missing in the major thyroglobulin
transcripts in the goiter and that aberrant splicing was due to a C-to-G
transversion at position -3 in the acceptor splice site of intron 3. The
presence in exon 4 of a putative donor tyrosine residue (tyr130)
involved in thyroid hormone formation provided a coherent explanation
for hypothyroidism. See Ieiri et al. (1991) for full report.

.0002
RECLASSIFIED - VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
TG, GLN870HIS

This variant, formerly titled GOITER, NONENDEMIC SIMPLE, has been
reclassified based on the findings of Vono-Toniolo et al. (2005).

In 25 of 56 members of 3 families affected by simple goiter (see
274700), Corral et al. (1993) identified heterozygosity for a 2610G-T
transversion in exon 10 of the TG gene, which resulted in a
gln870-to-his (Q870H) substitution (neutral polar to positively charged
polar amino acid). Fourteen of the gene carriers had developed the
disorder, which appeared to be age dependent.

Vono-Toniolo et al. (2005) discussed the heterozygous TG mutation,
2610G-T, associated with simple goiter reported by Corral et al. (1993)
and corresponding to Q851H in the mature peptide. They noted that 11
unaffected individuals were found to carry this allele. Given that the
TG gene contains multiple polymorphisms, and in the absence of
functional data, it remained unclear whether this alteration was indeed
causally involved in the development of the abnormal phenotype. They
considered congenital hypothyroidism with goiter caused by TG mutation
to be a recessively inherited disorder.

.0003
THYROID DYSHORMONOGENESIS 3
TG, ARG1511TER

Targovnik et al. (1989) reported familial goitrous hypothyroidism (TDH3;
274700) in a kindred in Brazil. Two affected sibs were thought to have
nonconsanguineous parents but later inquiry (Targovnik et al., 1993)
indicated that the parents were first cousins. Goiter and hypothyroidism
dated from early childhood. Thyroglobulin was virtually absent from
thyroid tissue. Both serum and thyroid tissue contained an increased
concentration of an albumin-like iodoprotein, and thyroid tissues
contained a decreased level of TG mRNA. Targovnik et al. (1993)
identified a C-to-T transition changing codon 1510 from CGA (arg) to TGA
(stop). Targovnik et al. (1998) reported on further studies of the
Brazilian kindred. The arg1510-to-ter mutation was present in compound
heterozygous state in the 3 affected members, 2 uncles and a nephew;
however, the second mutation, in combination with the arg1510-to-ter
change, appeared to be different in the nephew from that in the 2
uncles, and a total of 3 different mutated alleles were postulated to
explain the findings in this kindred.

Gutnisky et al. (2004) noted that this mutation is a 4588C-T transition
in exon 22 of the TG gene, resulting in an R1511X substitution.

.0004
THYROID DYSHORMONOGENESIS 3
TG, 138-BP DEL, NT5590 TG, IVS30, +1, G-T

Targovnik et al. (1995) studied 2 sibs with congenital goitrous
hypothyroidism (TDH3; 274700) who were the product of a consanguineous
mating. Diagnosis of defective TG was based on findings of low serum T4,
low normal or normal serum T3, a negative perchlorate discharge test,
and the virtual absence of the serum TG response to challenge by bovine
TSH. Only minute amounts of TG-related antigens were detected by RIA in
the goitrous tissue (0.82, compared to 70-90 mg/g in normal thyroid
tissue), and virtual absence of TG was confirmed by SDS agarose gel
electrophoresis. Sequencing of RT-PCR products of TG mRNA from an
affected sib revealed apparent homozygosity for an isoform missing 138
nucleotides between positions 5590 and 5727. This deletion does not
affect the reading frame of the resulting mRNA and is potentially fully
translatable into a truncated TG polypeptide chain that is shortened by
46 residues. A cysteine residue is maintained by the junction between
the proximal T from leucine-1831 and the distal GT from cysteine-1877.
Sequencing of PCR products of genomic DNA excluded a deletion within the
TG gene.

Targovnik et al. (2001) determined that the deletion of 138 nucleotides,
which correspond to exon 30 of the TG gene, was caused by a
guanine-to-thymine transversion at position +1 in the splice donor site
of intron 30 (IVS30+1G-T). The deletion did not affect the reading frame
of the resulting mRNA and generated a TG polypeptide chain that was
shortened by 46 residues.

.0005
THYROID DYSHORMONOGENESIS 3
TG, CYS1245ARG

Hishinuma et al. (2006) stated that based on a renumbering of the TG
gene sequence, the mutation originally referred to as CYS1263ARG
(C1263R) had been changed to CYS1245ARG (C1245R).

Hishinuma et al. (1999) analyzed the TG gene of 2 unrelated patients
with congenital goiter (CG) and 2 sibs with the variant type of
adenomatous goiter (274700) (AG) (TDH3; 274700). Clinical findings were
similar for both types of patients, except for serum TG levels, which
were less than 15 pmol/L in those with CG, but 117 to 181 pmol/L in
those with the variant type of AG (normal, 15 to 50 pmol/L). The 2
unrelated subjects with CG, who were homozygous for a C-to-T transition
at nucleotide 3787, resulting in a cys1263-to-arg substitution, were
from pedigrees that showed an autosomal recessive pattern of
inheritance. The 2 sibs with AG were homozygous for a T-to-A
transversion at nucleotide 5983, resulting in a cys1995-to-ser
substitution (188450.0006). The frequencies of both mutant alleles were
less than 0.5% in cDNAs from 110 normal subjects. Sensitivity to
treatment by endoglycosidase H suggested that the products of both
mutants were retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Also, the
presence of endoglycosidase H-resistant and -sensitive TG in the
patients with the variant type of AG suggested that a fraction of
cys1995-to-ser TG was transported to the Golgi and was associated with
the mildly increased serum TG levels. Native PAGE and Western blot
analysis with anti-TG antibody showed that both mutant products formed
high molecular mass aggregates in the ER. The authors concluded that
missense mutations that replace cysteine with either arginine or serine
cause an abnormal 3-dimensional structure of TG and that the resulting
misfolded TG products are retained in the ER as high molecular mass
aggregates.

In a patient with goiter, Hishinuma et al. (2005) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the TG gene: C1245R, which they
designated CYS1264ARG, and gly2356-to-arg (G2356R; 188450.0015).

.0006
THYROID DYSHORMONOGENESIS 3
TG, CYS1977SER

Hishinuma et al. (2006) stated that based on a renumbering of the TG
gene sequence, the mutation originally referred to as CYS1995SER
(C1995S) had been changed to CYS1977SER (C1977S).

See 188450.0005 and Hishinuma et al. (1999).

By haplotype analysis, Hishinuma et al. (2006) identified the C1977S
mutation as a founder mutation in Japan.

.0007
THYROID DYSHORMONOGENESIS 3
TG, ARG277TER

Van de Graaf et al. (1999) studied the TG mRNA from thyroid tissue of a
13-year-old patient with goiter and hypothyroidism who was suspected to
have a TG synthesis defect (TDH3; 274700). The complete coding region
was directly sequenced, revealing a homozygous C-to-T transition at
nucleotide 886 in exon 7, resulting in an arg277-to-ter mutation
(R277X). Two other sibs presented with the same clinical findings as the
index patient, but their parents were unaffected. Additional RFLP
analysis of the pedigree verified that the homozygous nonsense mutation
cosegregated with the clinical phenotype. Clinically, hypothyroidism was
not severe in the affected sibs, because the truncated TG glycoprotein
was still capable of thyroid hormonogenesis.

Gutnisky et al. (2004) found this mutation in the Brazilian family
originally reported by Targovnik et al. (1989). Affected members of this
family carried the R277X mutation in compound heterozygous state with
either R1511X (188450.0003) or a splice site mutation (188450.0013).
Gutnisky et al. (2004) presented evidence that a founder effect accounts
for the R277X mutation in their family and that reported by Van de Graaf
et al. (1999).

Rivolta et al. (2005) reported this mutation in an Argentinian patient
with congenital goiter, hypothyroidism, and impairment of TG synthesis.
Haplotype analysis in this patient and one previously reported with the
mutation suggested that a mutational hotspot at nucleotide 886, rather
than founder effect, accounts for the recurrence of the mutation.

.0008
AUTOIMMUNE THYROID DISEASE, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 3
TG, ARG1980TRP

Ban et al. (2003) reported the identification of amino acid
substitutions in the TG gene predisposing to autoimmune thyroid disease.
A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in exon 33, designated TG_E33SNP,
consists of either a C or T at nucleotide 5995, resulting in either arg
or trp at codon 1980 (R1980W). Homozygosity for the C susceptibility
allele of TG_E33SNP, together with the presence of either 1 or 2 copies
of the susceptibility allele of either one of the SNPs of the exon 10-12
cluster (see 188450.0009-188450.0010), conferred the strongest
association with AITD (AITD3; 608175).

In a study of 1,214 Caucasian patients in the United Kingdom with AITD
examining the same SNPs in the TG gene as those studied by Ban et al.
(2003), Collins et al. (2004) found no evidence for association of this
variant with AITD.

.0009
AUTOIMMUNE THYROID DISEASE, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 3
TG, SER734ALA

Ban et al. (2003) identified a SNP in exon 10 of the TG gene,
TG_E10SNP24, consisting of a T or G at nucleotide 2200 and resulting in
either a ser or ala at residue 734 (S734A). The presence of the T allele
conferred susceptibility to AITD (AITD3; 608175).

In a study of 1,214 Caucasian patients in the United Kingdom with AITD
examining the same SNPs in the TG gene as those studied by Ban et al.
(2003), Collins et al. (2004) found no evidence for association of this
variant with AITD.

.0010
AUTOIMMUNE THYROID DISEASE, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 3
TG, MET1027VAL

Ban et al. (2003) identified a SNP in exon 12 of the TG gene, TG_E12SNP,
consisting of an A or G at nucleotide 3082 and resulting in either a met
or val at residue 1027 (M1027V). The presence of the A allele conferred
susceptibility to AITD (AITD3; 608175).

In a study of 1,214 Caucasian patients in the United Kingdom with AITD
examining the same SNPs in the TG gene as those studied by Ban et al.
(2003), Collins et al. (2004) found no evidence for association of this
variant with AITD.

.0011
THYROID DYSHORMONOGENESIS 3
TG, 1-BP DEL, 1143C

In 2 sibs with congenital goitrous hypothyroidism (TDH3; 274700)
diagnosed prenatally, Caron et al. (2003) found compound heterozygosity
for mutations in the TG gene: deletion of a cytosine at nucleotide 1143
in exon 9 (1143delC), inherited from the father; and an arg2223-to-his
(R2223H) amino acid substitution, inherited from the mother
(188450.0012). The 1143delC mutation resulted in a frameshift that
generates a stop codon at position 382.

.0012
THYROID DYSHORMONOGENESIS 3
TG, ARG2223HIS

The R2223H mutation causing congenital goitrous hypothyroidism (TDH3;
274700) described by Caron et al. (2003) resulted from a G-to-A
transition at position 6725 in exon 38 of the TG gene. Arginine-2223,
within the acetylcholinesterase (ACHE) homology domain of thyroglobulin,
is strictly conserved in all species for which suitable thyroglobulin
and ACHE sequences had been reported. Computer analysis of the protein's
secondary structure showed that the R2223H mutation caused an extended
stretch of the helix structure. Caron et al. (2003) hypothesized that
arg2223 plays a critical structural role in thyroglobulin.

.0013
THYROID DYSHORMONOGENESIS 3
TG, IVS34, G-C, -1

In the Brazilian family originally reported by Targovnik et al. (1989)
with congenital goiter, hypothyroidism, and marked impairment of
thyroglobulin synthesis (TDH3; 274700), Gutnisky et al. (2004) found a
splice site mutation, IVS34-1G-C, in the TG gene, resulting in skipping
of exon 35. This family was thus shown to carry 3 different
single-nucleotide changes in the TG gene, with affected members being
compound heterozygotes for either the splice site mutation and R277X
(188450.0007) or R277X and R1511X (188450.0003).

.0014
THYROID DYSHORMONOGENESIS 3
TG, CYS1058ARG

Hishinuma et al. (2006) identified homozygosity for a cys1058-to-arg
(C1058R) mutation in the TG gene in 8 affected members of 5 families
with goiter (TDH3; 274700) in Japan. By haplotype analysis, they
identified C1058R as a founder mutation.

.0015
THYROID DYSHORMONOGENESIS 3
TG, GLY2356ARG

In a patient with goiter (TDH3; 274700), Hishinuma et al. (2005)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the TG gene:
C1245R (188450.0005) and a novel 7123G-A transition resulting in a
gly2356-to-arg substitution (G2356R), which they designated GLY2375ARG.
Kanou et al. (2007) performed morphologic and biochemical analyses on
this patient's thyroid gland, followed by a pulse-chase experiment, and
determined that the G2356R mutation, like the C1245R mutation, produces
a defect in intracellular TG transport.

.0016
THYROID DYSHORMONOGENESIS 3
TG, CYS1897TYR

In a Japanese girl with congenital goitrous hypoparathyroidism (TDH3;
274700), Kitanaka et al. (2006) identified compound heterozygosity for 2
mutations in the TG gene: cys1897 to tyr (C1897Y) and arg2336 to gln
(R2336Q; 188450.0017).

THYROID DYSHORMONOGENESIS 3
TG, IVS5DS, G-A, +1

In 2 brothers with recurrent large goiters (TDH3; 274200), 1 of whom
developed metastatic follicular thyroid carcinoma (see 188470),
Alzahrani et al. (2006) analyzed the TG gene and identified homozygosity
for a G-to-A transition in intron 5 of the TG gene (IVS5+1G-A). RT-PCR
analysis of peripheral blood RNA revealed that the mutation causes
skipping of exon 5 with fusion of exons 4 and 6, which results in a
frameshift and severe truncation of the polypeptide due to a stop codon
generated 6 amino acids after exon 4. The unaffected consanguineous
parents were heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found in an
unaffected brother. Alzahrani et al. (2006) also screened for RAS
oncogene mutations by direct sequencing of thyroid tumor DNA, but
identified no mutation in codons 12, 13, and 61 of the HRAS (190020),
KRAS (190070), and NRAS (164790) oncogenes. The authors concluded that
the malignant transformation of the congenital goiter was likely the
result of prolonged TSH stimulation, probably in combination with
mutations of oncogenes and/or tumor suppressor genes other than RAS.

AUTOIMMUNE THYROID DISEASE, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 3
TG, -1623, A-G, dbSNP rs180195

Stefan et al. (2011) identified a -1623A-G SNP (dbSNP rs180195) in the
promoter region of the TG gene that modified a binding site for IRF1
(147575) and predisposed to autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD; 608175).
By genotyping 271 Caucasian patients with AITD (201 with Graves disease
and 70 with Hashimoto thyroiditis) and 165 matched controls, they found
a significant increase in the frequency of the G allele (p = 0.006) and
the GG genotype (p = 0.03; odds ratio = 1.6) in AITD patients compared
with controls. Stefan et al. (2011) confirmed the association in a
cohort of 102 multiplex families. Database analysis revealed that dbSNP
rs180195 lies within a putative binding motif for IRF1 or ETS1 (164720),
and that the AITD-associated G allele is conserved in vertebrates,
whereas the protective A allele is unique to humans. Cell culture and in
vitro assays revealed that IRF1 bound the TG promoter with the G allele
at the dbSNP rs180195 site and activated transcription of a reporter
gene. Binding of IRF1 correlated with histone markers of active
chromatin. IRF1 did not activate transcription from the A allele. Stefan
et al. (2011) concluded that the disease-associated variant of TG
defines an active enhancer element.

;;MINOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY ANTIGEN HA-8;;
HLA-HA8
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening for large genes in an immature myeloid cell line cDNA
library, Nomura et al. (1994) cloned KIAA0020. The predicted 647-amino
acid KIAA0020 protein has a tyrosine phosphorylation site and a
prokaryotic membrane lipoprotein lipid attachment site. Northern blot
analysis detected ubiquitous expression, with highest levels in lung,
liver, kidney, testis, ovary, and colon.

Using an HLA-A*0201-restricted cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) clone
obtained from a bone marrow transplant patient, Brickner et al. (2001)
identified a minor histocompatibility antigen, HA-8, that differed in an
HLA-identical sib donor-derived B-cell line. Mass spectrometric and CTL
analyses defined a nonapeptide, RTLDKVLEV, as the epitope recognized by
the CTL line. Database analysis showed that the sequence corresponds to
residues 149 to 157 of KIAA0020, which Brickner et al. (2001) reported
as a 508-amino acid protein. Variants of the nonapeptide were less well
presented to the CTL line, partly due to poor transportation by TAP1
(170260). Brickner et al. (2001) proposed that HA-8 recognition
differences may result from altered antigenic processing rather than
differences in interaction with major histocompatibility complex
molecules or the T-cell receptor.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nomura et al. (1994) mapped the KIAA0020
gene to chromosome 9.

602098	TITLE *602098 POLO-LIKE KINASE 1; PLK1
;;POLO-LIKE KINASE; PLK;;
SERINE/THREONINE PROTEIN KINASE 13; STPK13
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The product of the Drosophila polo gene is a serine/threonine protein
kinase which is involved in mitosis. Drosophila polo is related to the
yeast CDC5 gene. The human homolog of the polo gene was cloned
independently by Lake and Jelinek (1993), Holtrich et al. (1994), and
Hamanaka et al. (1994). All reported that the human polo-like kinase
(PLK) gene encodes a 603-amino acid polypeptide. Several nucleotide
sequence differences were noted among the published sequences, but
Hamanaka et al. (1994) stated that these differences encode conservative
changes in the amino acid sequence and are likely to be polymorphisms.
Hamanaka et al. (1994) reported that the molecular weight of the PLK
protein is 66 kD. By Northern blot analysis, they showed PLK was not
expressed in any adult human tissues except placenta. Among mouse
tissues, expression was observed in adult thymus tissue and ovaries and
in fetuses. Among cultured cell lines, the PLK message was detected in
all growing cell lines. Hamanaka et al. (1994) noted that the level of
PLK message was not induced by serum stimulation. Lake and Jelinek
(1993) examined the level of PLK mRNA during the cell cycle of
synchronized NIH 3T3 cells and found that the mRNA is absent or
expressed at very low levels during the G1 phase, begins to reaccumulate
during the S phase, and reaches maximal levels during the G2/M phase.
Holtrich et al. (1994) observed that PLK transcripts are present at high
levels in tumors of various origins.

GENE FUNCTION

Golsteyn et al. (1995) expressed recombinant human PLK1 in insect cells
and found that it phosphorylated casein (see 115450) on serine and
threonine residues. PLK1 also phosphorylated myelin basic protein (MBP;
159430) and microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP2; 157130), but to a
lesser extent than casein. In synchronized HeLa cells, PLK1 activity was
low during interphase and high during mitosis. Confocal microscopy
showed that PLK1 bound components of the mitotic spindle at all stages
of mitosis, but it was redistributed as cells progressed from metaphase
to anaphase. Specifically, PLK1 associated with spindle poles up to
metaphase, but it relocalized to the equatorial plane, where spindle
microtubules overlapped, as cells went through anaphase. Golsteyn et al.
(1995) concluded that PLK1 functions in mitotic cells to control spindle
dynamics and chromosome segregation.

Smith et al. (1997) showed that microinjection of PLK mRNA induced
mitosis in quiescent NIH 3T3 cells. Constitutive expression of PLK
caused NIH 3T3 cells to proliferate in low serum media, but at a lower
rate than cells transformed with v-Ras (179555) or v-Src (190090). Cells
transformed with PLK grew in soft agar and produced tumors in nude mice.
Smith et al. (1997) concluded that PLK may be involved in the promotion
or progression of cancers.

In vertebrate cells, nuclear entry of mitosis-promoting factor (MPF; see
cyclin B1, 123836) during prophase is thought to be essential for
induction and coordination of M-phase events. Phosphorylation of cyclin
B1 is central to its nuclear translocation. Toyoshima-Morimoto et al.
(2001) purified a protein kinase from Xenopus M-phase extracts that
phosphorylated a crucial serine (S147) in the middle of the nuclear
export signal of cyclin B1. They identified this kinase as Plx1, a
Xenopus homolog of PLK1. During cell cycle progression in HeLa cells, a
change in the kinase activity of endogenous PLK1 toward S147 and/or S133
correlated with kinase activity in the cell extracts. An anti-PLK1
antibody depleted the M-phase extracts of the kinase activity toward
S147 and/or S133. An anti-phospho-S147 antibody reacted specifically
with cyclin B1 only during G2/M phase. A mutant cyclin B1 in which S133
and S147 were replaced by alanines remained in the cytoplasm, whereas
wildtype cyclin B1 accumulated in the nucleus during prophase.
Coexpression of constitutively active PLK1 stimulated nuclear entry of
cyclin B1. Toyoshima-Morimoto et al. (2001) concluded that PLK1 may be
involved in targeting MPF to the nucleus during prophase.

Elia et al. (2003) used a proteomic screen to identify the polo-box
domain of PLK1 as a specific phosphoserine or phosphothreonine binding
domain and determined its optimal binding motif. This motif is present
in PLK1 substrates such as CDC25 (157680), and an optimal phosphopeptide
containing the motif disrupted polo-box domain-substrate binding and
localization of the polo-box domain to centrosomes. Elia et al. (2003)
concluded that their observations revealed how PLK1 can localize to
specific sites within cells in response to CDK phosphorylation at those
sites and provided a structural mechanism for targeting the PLK1 kinase
domain to its substrates.

Meiosis is a specialized cell division in which 2 chromosome segregation
phases follow a single DNA replication phase. Lee and Amon (2003)
studied the S. cerevisiae Polo-like kinase CDC5, whose human homolog is
PLK, and found it to be instrumental in establishing the meiosis I
chromosome segregation program. CDC5 was required to phosphorylate and
remove meiotic cohesin from chromosomes. Furthermore, in the absence of
CDC5, kinetochores were bioriented during meiosis I, and Mam1, a yeast
protein essential for coorientation, failed to associate with
kinetochores. Thus, sister-kinetochore coorientation and chromosome
segregation during meiosis I are coupled through their dependence upon
CDC5.

Elevated expression of PLK1 occurs in many different types of cancer,
and PLK1 has been proposed as a diagnostic marker for several tumors.
Liu and Erikson (2003) used the vector-based small interfering RNA
(siRNA) technique to specifically deplete PLK1 in cancer cells. They
found that such depletion dramatically inhibited cell proliferation,
decreased viability, and resulted in cell-cycle arrest with a 4 N DNA
content. The formation of dumbbell-like chromatin structure suggested
the inability of these cells to completely separate the sister
chromatids at the onset of anaphase. PLK1 depletion induced apoptosis,
as indicated by the appearance of subgenomic DNA in
fluorescence-activated cell-sorter (FACS) profiles, the activation of
caspase-3 (600636), and the formation of fragmented nuclei. The p53
pathway (191170) was shown to be involved in PLK1 depletion-induced
apoptosis. DNA damage occurred in PLK1-depleted cells and inhibition of
ATM (607585) strongly potentiated the lethality of PLK1 depletion. The
data supported the notion that disruption of PLK1 function could be an
important application in cancer therapy.

Yoo et al. (2004) showed that, during checkpoint response, Xenopus
claspin (605434) becomes phosphorylated on thr906, creating a docking
site for Plx1. This interaction promotes phosphorylation of claspin on
ser934 by Plx1. Yoo et al. (2004) stated that, after a prolonged
interphase arrest, aphidicolin-treated egg extracts typically undergo
adaptation and enter into mitosis despite the presence of incompletely
replicated DNA. In this process, claspin dissociates from chromatin, and
Chk1 (603078) undergoes inactivation. By contrast, aphidicolin-treated
extracts containing mutants of claspin with thr906-to-ala or
ser934-to-ala substitutions were unable to undergo adaptation. Under
such adaptation-defective conditions, claspin accumulated on chromatin
at high levels, and Chk1 did not decrease in activity. These results
indicated that the Plx1-dependent inactivation of claspin results in
termination of a DNA replication checkpoint response.

Petronczki et al. (2007) stated that localization of ECT2 (600586) to
the central spindle at anaphase promotes local activation of RhoA GTPase
(165390), which induces assembly and ingression of the contractile ring.
They showed that PLK1 functioned in the same pathway to initiate
cytokinesis. Inhibition of PLK1 in HeLa cells abolished interaction of
ECT2 with its activator and midzone anchor, CYK4 (RACGAP1; 604980),
thereby preventing localization of ECT2 to the central spindle and
leading to early cytokinesis defects.

Wang et al. (2007) showed that Drosophila Polo, a key cell cycle
regulator, the mammalian counterparts of which have been implicated as
oncogenes as well as tumor suppressors, acts as a tumor suppressor in
the larval brain. Supernumerary neuroblasts are produced at the expense
of neurons in polo mutants. Polo directly phosphorylates partner of Numb
(Pon), a Drosophila adaptor protein for Numb (see 603728), and this
phosphorylation event is important for Pon to localize Numb. In Polo
mutants, the asymmetric localization of Pon, Numb, and atypical protein
kinase C are disrupted, whereas other polarity markers are largely
unaffected. Overexpression of Numb suppresses neuroblast
overproliferation caused by polo mutations, suggesting that Numb has a
major role in mediating this effect of Polo. Wang et al. (2007)
concluded that their results revealed a biochemical link between the
cell cycle and the asymmetric protein localization machinery, and
indicated that Polo can inhibit progenitor self-renewal by regulating
the localization and function of Numb.

Seki et al. (2008) reported that the synergistic action of BORA (610510)
and kinase Aurora A (603072) controls the G2-M transition. BORA
accumulates in the G2 phase and promotes Aurora A-mediated activation of
PLK1, leading to the activation of cyclin-dependent kinase-1 (CDK1;
116940) and mitotic entry. Mechanistically, BORA interacts with PLK1 and
controls the accessibility of its activation loop for phosphorylation
and activation by Aurora A. Thus, Seki et al. (2008) concluded that BORA
and Aurora A control mitotic entry.

Macurek et al. (2008) demonstrated that in human cells PLK1 activation
occurs several hours before entry into mitosis, and requires Aurora
A-dependent phosphorylation of thr210. They found that Aurora A can
directly phosphorylate PLK1 on thr210, and that activity of Aurora A
toward PLK1 is greatly enhanced by BORA, a known cofactor for Aurora A.
Macurek et al. (2008) showed that BORA/Aurora-A-dependent
phosphorylation is a prerequisite for PLK1 to promote mitotic entry
after a checkpoint-dependent arrest. Importantly, expression of a
PLK1-T210D phosphomimicking mutant partially overcame the requirement
for Aurora A in checkpoint recovery. Macurek et al. (2008) concluded
that taken together, their data demonstrated that the initial activation
of PLK1 is a primary function of Aurora A.

Ikeda et al. (2012) found that depletion of FRY (614818) in HeLa cells
via siRNA resulted in misalignment of chromosomes during mitosis due to
centriole splitting. FRY knockdown reduced the kinase activity of PLK1
and reduced accumulation of thr210-phosphorylated PLK1 at spindle poles
in mitotic cells. Mouse Fry interacted with PLK1 in vitro and in cells,
and the 2 proteins colocalized to centrosomes in early mitosis. Mutation
analysis revealed that the interaction was mediated by the C-terminal
domain of Fry and the C-terminal polo-box domain of PLK1. The
interaction increased the kinase activity of PLK1 and was dependent upon
Fry phosphorylation by CDK1. Phosphorylated Fry also interacted with
Aurora A, resulting in increased Aurora A-dependent phosphorylation of
PLK1 thr210, but not global Aurora A activation. Ikeda et al. (2012)
hypothesized that phosphorylated FRY functions in activation of PLK1, at
least in part, by acting as a scaffold for interaction of Aurora A and
PLK1.

ANIMAL MODEL

To identify the source of newly formed cardiomyocytes during zebrafish
heart regeneration, Jopling et al. (2010) established a genetic strategy
to trace the lineage of cardiomyocytes in the adult fish, on the basis
of the Cre/lox system widely used in the mouse. They used this system to
show that regenerated heart muscle cells are derived from the
proliferation of differentiated cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, the
proliferating cardiomyocytes undergo limited dedifferentiation
characterized by the disassembly of their sarcomeric structure,
detachment from one another, and the expression of regulators of
cell-cycle progression. Specifically, Jopling et al. (2010) showed that
the gene product of polo-like kinase 1 (plk1) is an essential component
of cardiomyocyte proliferation during heart regeneration. Jopling et al.
(2010) concluded that their data provided the first direct evidence for
the source of proliferating cardiomyocytes during zebrafish heart
regeneration and indicated that stem or progenitor cells are not
significantly involved in this process.

;;ILP-INTERACTING PROTEIN; ILPIP;;
ALS2 CHROMOSOME REGION GENE 2; ALS2CR2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing candidate genes in the ALS2 (205100) critical region,
Hadano et al. (2001) identified ALS2CR2. The deduced 418-amino acid
protein has a calculated molecular mass of about 47 kD. ALS2CR2 contains
a typical protein kinase domain and shares significant homology with
more than 30 serine/threonine protein kinases. Northern blot analysis
revealed highest expression of a 2.4-kb transcript in heart, skeletal
muscle, and colon. A 2.6-kb transcript, which may represent use of an
alternate polyadenylation signal, was detected in testis.

Sanna et al. (2002) cloned ALS2CR2, which they called ILPIP, in a yeast
2-hybrid screen of a fetal brain cDNA library using XIAP (300079) as
bait. They isolated the full-length cDNA by screening a liver cDNA
library. The 418-amino acid ILPIP protein, which the authors termed
ILPIP-alpha, contains a putative N-terminal ATP-binding site, a protein
kinase domain, and several C-terminal phosphorylation sites. Sanna et
al. (2002) also identified a 280-amino acid isoform, which they termed
ILPIP-beta, that lacks the first 138 amino acids of the N terminus of
ILPIP-alpha. Northern blot analysis detected expression of a 2.4-kb
transcript in muscle, liver, and heart, as well as in embryonic kidney
cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Sanna et al. (2002) determined that ILPIP potentiates the antiapoptotic
activity of XIAP by enhancing XIAP-mediated activation of JNK1 (MAPK8;
601158) and other JNK family members, but not by modulating
XIAP-mediated caspase inhibition. They also found that expression of a
catalytically inactive TAK1 (MAP3K7; 602614) mutant blocked the
XIAP/ILPIP activation of JNK1. In vivo coprecipitation experiments
showed that both ILPIP and XIAP interact with TAK1 and TRAF6 (602355).
Sanna et al. (2002) concluded that XIAP-mediated protection from
apoptosis utilizes both a JNK1 activation pathway that involves ILPIP
and a caspase inhibition pathway that is independent of ILPIP.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hadano et al. (2001) determined that the ALS2CR2 gene contains 12 exons
and spans 30 kb. It is transcribed in the centromere-to-telomere
direction. The promoter for ALS2CR2 is close to, or overlaps, the
promoter for ALS2CR3 (607334), which is transcribed in the opposite
orientation.

MAPPING

Hadano et al. (2001) mapped the STRADB gene within the ALS2 critical
region on chromosome 2q33-q34. They identified 2 intronless pseudogenes
that map to chromosomes 1 and 9.

;;ADIPONUTRIN; ADPN;;
PHOSPHOLIPASE A2, CALCIUM-INDEPENDENT, EPSILON;;
IPLA2-EPSILON
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By mRNA differential display to identify genes involved in adipose
conversion of mouse preadipocyte cell lines, Baulande et al. (2001)
cloned mouse Pnpla3, which they called Adpn. The deduced protein
contains 413 amino acids. By database analysis, Baulande et al. (2001)
identified human ADPN and several other related eukaryotic proteins,
including human and mouse TTS2 (PNPLA2; 609059). These proteins share
highest similarity in an N-terminal region containing 3 transmembrane
domains, and they have a fourth transmembrane domain in the variable
C-terminal region. Conserved motifs are located within transmembrane
domain 2 and in the linker region between transmembrane domains 3 and 4.
Northern blot analysis detected Adpn expression in differentiated mouse
adipocytes and in white and brown adipose tissue, but not in any other
mouse tissue examined. Confocal scanning microscopy detected
epitope-tagged Adpn near the periphery of the plasma membrane in
patch-like structures and in numerous punctate structures in the
cytoplasm of transfected cells.

Huang et al. (2010) stated that the deduced 481-amino acid human PNPLA3
protein contains an N-terminal patatin-like domain. Real-time PCR of
human tissues detected highest PNPLA3 expression in liver, followed by
skin and adipose tissue. In fractionated mouse liver, expression of
Pnpla3 was higher in hepatocytes than in stellate cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Baulande et al. (2001) found the expression of Adpn increased
dramatically following induction of adipose conversion in mouse
adipocytes, and it paralleled the expression of fatty acid synthase
(FAS; 600212) and Srebp1c, a variant of Srebp1 (SREBF1; 184756).
D-glucose elicited a 7-fold increase in Adpn mRNA levels, and insulin
had a slight effect on Adpn expression in the presence or absence of
glucose. The glucose-induced increase in Adpn expression could be
countered by agents known to raise intracellular cAMP. In vivo, Adpn
mRNA was high in white and brown adipose tissue from fed mice, but it
dropped to barely detectable levels after 19 hours of fast. Refeeding
for 8 hours reversed the drop in Adpn mRNA. Fas and Srebp1c mRNA
exhibited a similar pattern of expression. Just after a feeding period,
Zucker fa/fa obese rats showed 30- to 50-fold elevation of Adpn mRNA
relative to congenic lean controls. Baulande et al. (2001) concluded
that ADPN has a regulatory role in lipogenesis or lipolysis.

Jenkins et al. (2004) found that purified recombinant ADPN, PNPLA2, and
GS2 (PNPLA4; 300102) expressed in insect cells showed abundant
triacylglycerol lipase activity. The recombinant enzymes also showed
acylglycerol transacylase activity by transferring the acyl donor
mono-olein to mono-olein or diolein acceptors to form diolein and
triolein, respectively.

Liu et al. (2004) investigated ADPN mRNA expression in subcutaneous
adipose tissue of nonobese women and obese women during a 2-day very
low-calorie diet (VLCD) and subsequent refeeding, as well as before and
after a 3-week VLCD. The ADPN mRNA levels of nonobese and obese women
were not different (P less than 0.05). Two-day VLCD reduced the average
level of ADPN mRNA expression by 36% (P of 0.0016), whereas refeeding
elevated the mRNA level by 31% (P of 0.004). The 3-week VLCD caused a
dramatic 58% fall in the ADPN mRNA expression level (P of 0.001). The
mRNA level was negatively correlated with fasting glucose (rho of -0.62;
P less than 0.0001), and subjects with high ADPN mRNA level had
increased insulin sensitivity. Liu et al. (2004) concluded that ADPN
gene expression in humans is highly regulated by changes in energy
balance.

Huang et al. (2010) found that Pnpla3 mRNA expression increased in
fasted mice following carbohydrate refeeding. Treatment of mice with an
Lxr (see 602423) agonist also increased hepatic Pnpla3 levels, which
required Srebp1c expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and
electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed that Srebp1c bound the
Pnpla3 promoter region. PNPLA3 protein levels were elevated following
treatment of human HuH7 hepatocytes with oleate or selected saturated or
polyunsaturated fatty acids, but not with very long chain
polyunsaturated fatty acid. Fatty acids increased the half-life of the
PNPLA3 protein, but did not alter PNPLA3 mRNA levels.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Baulande et al. (2001) mapped the PNPLA3
gene to chromosome 22q13.

607632	TITLE *607632 PRESENILIN ENHANCER 2, C. ELEGANS, HOMOLOG OF; PSENEN
;;PEN2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PEN2 is a component of the gamma-secretase complex, which also includes
presenilin (see PSEN1; 104311) and nicastrin (APH2; 605254). The
gamma-secretase complex is required for the intramembrane proteolysis of
a number of membrane proteins, including the amyloid-beta precursor
protein (APP; 104760) and Notch (190198).

CLONING

Francis et al. (2002) identified 2 presenilin enhancers in C. elegans,
Aph1 (see APH1A; 607629) and Pen2. By searching sequence databases, they
identified human, mouse, zebrafish, Drosophila, and Arabidopsis homologs
of PEN2. The predicted 101-amino acid human PEN2 protein contains 2
transmembrane domains and shares 43% and 96% identity with C. elegans
and mouse Pen2, respectively.

GENE FUNCTION

By analyzing C. elegans mutant phenotypes, Francis et al. (2002)
determined that Aph1 and Pen2 were required for Glp1/Notch-mediated
signaling, both in embryonic patterning and in postembryonic germline
proliferation. They observed that the human APH1 and PEN2 genes
partially rescued the C. elegans mutant phenotypes, demonstrating
conserved functions. Human APH1 and PEN2 had to be provided together to
rescue the mutant phenotypes, and inclusion of PSEN1 improved rescue.
Francis et al. (2002) concluded that APH1 and PEN2 cooperate closely in
the same process to promote presenilin activity. Using RNA-mediated
interference assays to inactivate Aph1, Pen2, or nicastrin in cultured
Drosophila cells, Francis et al. (2002) observed reduction in
gamma-secretase cleavage of beta-APP and Notch substrates and reduction
in the levels of processed presenilin. They concluded that APH1 and PEN2
are required for Notch pathway signaling, gamma-secretase cleavage of
beta-APP, and presenilin protein accumulation. In a commentary, Goutte
(2002) discussed the contribution of Francis et al. (2002) to current
understanding of how presenilins mediate the gamma-secretase cleavage of
Notch transmembrane receptors and transmembrane beta-APP.

Using coimmunoprecipitation experiments, Steiner et al. (2002) showed
that PEN2 binds to nicastrin, PSEN1, and PSEN2 (600759), and they
concluded that PEN2 is a critical component of PSEN1/gamma-secretase and
PSEN2/gamma-secretase complexes. Steiner et al. (2002) observed that
Pen2 levels were reduced in mice lacking Psen1 or both Psen1 and Psen2.
They also observed that PEN2 levels were reduced upon RNA
interference-mediated downregulation of nicastrin. Steiner et al. (2002)
concluded that PEN2 expression requires the presence of presenilins and
nicastrin. Additionally, they reported that downregulation of PEN2 by
RNA interference was associated with reduced presenilin levels, impaired
nicastrin maturation, and deficient gamma-secretase complex formation.

Gamma-secretase activity requires the formation of a stable, high
molecular mass protein complex that, in addition to the endoproteolyzed
fragmented form of presenilin, contains essential cofactors including
nicastrin (605254), APH1 (607629, 607630), and PEN2. Takasugi et al.
(2003) showed that Drosophila APH1 increases the stability of Drosophila
presenilin holoprotein in the complex. Depletion of PEN2 by RNA
interference prevented endoproteolysis of presenilin and promoted
stabilization of the holoprotein in both Drosophila and mammalian cells,
including primary neurons. Coexpression of Drosophila Pen2 with Aph1 and
nicastrin increased the formation of presenilin fragments as well as
gamma-secretase activity. Thus, Takasugi et al. (2003) concluded that
APH1 stabilizes the presenilin holoprotein in the complex, whereas PEN2
is required for endoproteolytic processing of presenilin and conferring
gamma-secretase activity to the complex.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Wang et al. (2010) identified two 4-generation pedigrees segregating
autosomal dominant acne inversa (ACNINV2; 613736). Each family carried a
different heterozygous single-basepair substitution leading to
haploinsufficiency in affected individuals (607632.0001-607632.0002).

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Francis et al. (2002) mapped the PEN2 gene
to chromosome 19.

ANIMAL MODEL

By screening a library of about 80,000 chemical compounds, Kounnas et
al. (2010) identified a class of gamma-secretase modulators (GSMs),
diarylaminothiazoles, or series A GSMs, that could target production of
the fibrillogenic peptides amyloid (A)-beta-42 and A-beta-40 (see
104760) in cell lines and in Tg 2576 transgenic Alzheimer disease (AD;
104300) mice. Immobilized series A GSMs bound to Pen2 and, to a lesser
degree, Psen1. Series A GSMs reduced gamma-secretase activity without
interfering with related off-target reactions, lowered A-beta-42 levels
in both plasma and brain of Tg 2576 mice, and reduced plaque density and
amyloid in Tg 2576 hippocampus and cortex. Daily dosing was well
tolerated over the 7-month study.

resulting in frameshift and a premature termination codon (F23LfsX46).
This mutation was not identified in chromosomes from 200 ethnically

In a 4-generation Han Chinese family segregating autosomal dominant acne

deletion at nucleotide 279 of the PSENEN gene (279delC), resulting in a
frameshift and delayed termination codon (F94SfsX51). This mutation was

610281	TITLE *610281 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 62; ZFP62
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Polimeni et al. (1996) cloned mouse Zfp62, which they designated Zt3,
from a muscle cell cDNA library. The deduced 522-amino acid protein
contains 17 tandem canonical C2H2 zinc finger domains, none of which are
in the C terminus. Northern blot analysis detected Zfp62 expression in
adult skeletal and cardiac muscle and in spleen, with weaker expression
in kidney. In situ hybridization of postimplantation mouse embryos
detected diffuse Zfp62 expression, at highest levels in neural tube,
encephalic vesicles, somites, and limb buds. Later in fetal development,
Zfp62 was expressed in many tissues of neuroectodermal and mesodermal
origin.

GENE FUNCTION

Polimeni et al. (1996) determined that the expression of Zfp62 was
dependent on differentiation in mouse myogenic cells in culture. Zfp62
was not expressed in 2 mouse fibroblast cell lines, but was induced
during their myogenic conversion by transfection with muscle regulatory
genes (see, e.g., MYF6, 159991). Expression was also upregulated
following myogenic induction in a rhabdomyosarcoma cell line.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the ZFP62
gene to chromosome 5 (TMAP WI-15997). Polimeni et al. (1996) mapped the
mouse Zfp62 gene to chromosome 11.
