607074	TITLE *607074 PROTEIN KINASE D2; PRKD2
;;PKD2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By EST database searching with the conserved C-terminal sequence of
serine kinases and screening of a human ductal pancreatic cDNA library,
Sturany et al. (2001) cloned a novel serine/threonine protein kinase,
which they called PKD2. The deduced 878-amino acid protein, which has a
predicted molecular mass of 97 kD, contains an N-terminal hydrophobic
area predicted to be a transmembrane region, 2 cysteine-rich motifs that
form zinc finger-like repeats, a pleckstrin homology domain, and a
putative kinase domain containing the ATP-binding consensus sequence. An
invariant aspartate essential for kinase activity is located within a
motif conserved in serine/threonine kinases. The first zinc finger-like
domain shares 88% identity to the corresponding domains in PKD/PKC-mu
(PRKCM; 605435) and PKC-nu (PRKCN; 607077). Northern blot analysis
detected constitutive low expression of a 4-kb transcript; higher levels
were observed in pancreas, heart, lung, smooth muscle, and brain, and
lower levels kidney and liver. SDS-PAGE revealed a protein with a
molecular mass of 105 kD, as did Western blot analysis of endogenous
PRKD2 or protein expressed following transfection.

GENE FUNCTION

Sturany et al. (2001) demonstrated phorbol ester binding to the duplex
zinc finger-like motif of PRKD2 as well as autophosphorylation following
phorbol ester stimulation. The addition of phosphatidyl-L-serine caused
synergistic stimulation. Phorbol ester-activated PRKD2 migrated more
slowly than inactive PRKD2 by SDS-PAGE, suggesting hyperphosphorylation
upon activation.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PRKD2
gene to chromosome 19 (TMAP R67403).

610591	TITLE *610591 RHO GTPase-ACTIVATING PROTEIN 27; ARHGAP27
;;CIN85-ASSOCIATED MULTIDOMAIN-CONTAINING RhoGAP1; CAMGAP1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Rho (see ARHA; 165390)-like small GTPases are involved in many cellular
processes, and they are inactive in the GDP-bound state and active in
the GTP-bound state. GTPase-activating proteins, such as ARHGAP27,
inhibit Rho-like proteins by stimulating their intrinsic GTPase activity
(Katoh and Katoh, 2004).

CLONING

Sakakibara et al. (2004) cloned rat Arhgap27, which they called Camgap1,
and by database analysis, they identified human ARHGAP27. Both deduced
proteins contain an N-terminal SH3 domain, followed by 3 WW motifs, a
proline-rich region, a pleckstrin-homology (PH) domain, and a C-terminal
RhoGAP domain. Northern blot analysis of murine tissues detected highest
expression in kidney, lung, small intestine, and thymus.

By searching databases for sequences similar to ARHGAP12 (610577), Katoh
and Katoh (2004) cloned 2 variants of ARHGAP27 that differed in their
5-prime sequences due to utilization of alternative first exons. The
deduced proteins differed at their N-terminal ends. The full-length
protein contains 889 amino acids, and the N-terminally truncated protein
contains 548 amino acids.

GENE FUNCTION

By biochemical analysis, Sakakibara et al. (2004) determined that the
recombinant RhoGAP domain of rat Camgap1 induced the GTPase activity of
Rac1 (602048) and Cdc42 (116952), but not RhoA. Protein binding and
expression studies indicated that the second SH3 domain of CIN85
(SH3KBP1; 300374) bound to the proline-rich region of Camgap1.
Overexpression of the 3 WW domains of rat Camgap1, but not the
full-length protein, interfered with receptor (TFRC; 190010)-mediated
endocytosis of transferrin.

GENE STRUCTURE

Katoh and Katoh (2004) determined that the ARHGAP27 gene contains 18
exons and spans over 36.3 kb. Alternate first exons provide alternative
promoters.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Katoh and Katoh (2004) mapped the ARHGAP27
gene to chromosome 17q21.

;;HUGT1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGT) is a soluble protein
of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that selectively reglucosylates
unfolded glycoproteins, thus providing quality control for protein
transport out of the ER.

CLONING

Using a portion of Drosophila UGT to screen a human fetal liver cDNA
library, Arnold et al. (2000) isolated HUGT1. The assembled full-length
HUGT1 cDNA encodes a deduced 1,555-amino acid protein with a predicted
ER-targeting signal sequence, ER retrieval signal, 3 N-glycosylation
sites, and 2 disulfide loops. HUGT1 shares 55% sequence identity with
HUGT2 (605898) and 31 to 45% identity with Drosophila, C. elegans, and
S. pombe homologs. Northern blot analysis detected 3 HUGT1 transcripts
of 5.7, 8, and 10.6 kb in pancreas, heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver,
skeletal muscle, and kidney. Arnold et al. (2000) noted that HUGT1 and
HUGT2 differ slightly in their tissue distribution.

GENE FUNCTION

Using cell culture experiments, Arnold et al. (2000) demonstrated that
HUGT1 expression was induced upon disruption of protein folding in the
ER, whereas HUGT2 was not. By immunofluorescence microscopy, they
localized HUGT1 to the ER. Arnold et al. (2000) expressed HUGT1 in
transient transfection experiments and demonstrated UGT activity. Using
site-directed mutagenesis, they identified 4 residues of HUGT1 that are
essential for catalytic function.

MAPPING

Scott (2001) mapped the HUGT1 gene to chromosome 2 based on sequence
similarity between the HUGT1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF227905) and a
chromosome 2 clone (GenBank GENBANK AC017079).

602373	TITLE *602373 CALPONIN 2; CNN2
;;CALPONIN, NEUTRAL, NON-SMOOTH MUSCLE;;
CALPONIN H2, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Masuda et al. (1996) cloned a cDNA encoding calponin-2 (CNN2) by
screening a human heart cDNA library with a CNN1 (600806) cDNA. The CNN2
protein is 94.8% identical to mouse calponin h2 (see 600806), indicating
that these proteins are homologs. The predicted CNN2 protein has 309
amino acids and a pI of 7.1. It contains motifs that are present in CNN1
and CNN3 (602374): 3 tandem repeats of 29 amino acids, an actin-binding
domain, a VAV (164875)-homologous region, and 2 consensus
phosphorylation sites for tyrosine kinase at the C terminus. The 3-prime
untranslated region of the CNN2 mRNA contains an Alu repetitive sequence
in the antisense direction. RT-PCR detected CNN2 transcripts in both
cultured smooth muscle and nonmuscle cells and showed that mouse
calponin h2 is expressed in embryonic and adult heart. CNN2 protein
localizes to the cell-to-cell junctions of cardiomyocytes and
codistributes with vinculin (193065). Masuda et al. (1996) suggested
that CNN2 may be involved in the structural organization and/or
anchorage of actin filaments and may function in the cell adhesion
mechanism.

MAPPING

Cheng et al. (1994) mapped the CNN2 gene to chromosome 21q11.1 by
hybridization to chromosome 21q-specific YACs. However, Gross (2011)
mapped the CNN2 gene to chromosome 19p13.3 based on an alignment of the
CNN2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC141833) with the genomic sequence
(GRCh37).

TUMOR-SUPPRESSING STF cDNA 6;;
AML1-REGULATED TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN 1; ART1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PHEMX belongs to the conserved tetraspanin family of integral membrane
proteins, which are thought to form multiprotein networks in the cell
membrane in association with multiple protein partners. Tetraspanins
have functional roles in cell motility, membrane fusion, proliferation,
and adaptive immunity (Tarrant et al., 2002).

CLONING

An approximately 1-Mb region on chromosome 11p15 contains several
imprinted genes and appears to represent 1 of 2 known large imprinted
domains in the human genome, the other being the Prader-Willi/Angelman
syndrome domain of chromosome 15q11-q13 (see 105830). Koi et al. (1993)
isolated a subchromosomal transferable fragment (STF) that suppressed in
vitro growth of the rhabdomyosarcoma cell line RD, confirming the
existence of 1 or more tumor suppressor genes within this region. Hu et
al. (1997) found that the STF spans approximately 2.5 Mb, with D11S12 at
its proximal end and D11S1318 at its distal end. Within a cluster of
imprinted genes in this STF, Lee et al. (1999) identified 2 novel genes,
designated TSSC4 (603852) and TSSC6, that were not imprinted in any of
the fetal or extraembryonic tissues examined. The TSSC6 cDNA encodes a
predicted protein of 290 amino acids. Northern blot analysis failed to
detect TSSC6 gene expression; however, RT-PCR analysis suggested that
the TSSC6 gene is ubiquitously expressed at low levels.

Robb et al. (2001) cloned mouse Tssc6 by gene trapping, and they
isolated human TSSC6 by screening a fetal spleen cDNA library. The
deduced TSSC6 protein contains 4 hydrophobic transmembrane domains, a
large extracellular loop, and intracellular N and C termini. Robb et al.
(2001) identified 7 additional splice variants in mouse, 6 of which
encode proteins with in-frame deletions leading to loss of key
structural features, and 1 with a frameshift that results in protein
truncation. They also identified several human cDNAs encoding
alternatively spliced transcripts. Northern blot analysis detected
expression of mouse Tssc6 early in embryonic development in primitive
blood cells and in adult hematopoietic organs. Northern blot analysis of
hematopoietic cell lines detected highest expression in cell lines of
erythroid lineage.

By representational difference analysis (RDA) of mRNA isolated from
AML1/ETO (RUNX1; 151385) overexpressed mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells
and parental MEL cells, followed by screening a murine spleen cDNA
library, Harada et al. (2001) independently cloned mouse Tspan32, which
they called Art1. The deduced 229-amino acid mouse protein contains 4
predicted transmembrane domains. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues
detected a 2.0-kb transcript in spleen, bone marrow, and thymus. No
expression was detected in nonhematopoietic tissues examined. During
development, Art1 expression was first detected at around embryonic day
11.5, which corresponds to the start of definitive hematopoiesis, and
increased with further development. Harada et al. (2001) determined that
ART1 expression was regulated by AML1/ETO in erythroid cells, and they
suggested that ART1 may play a role in erythroid cell differentiation.

MAPPING

Lee et al. (1999) determined that the TSSC4 and TSSC6 genes, which are
not imprinted, are located in the center of a 1-Mb imprinted domain on
chromosome 11p15 that contains 7 imprinted genes. Thus, the imprinted
gene domain of 11p15 appears to contain at least 2 imprinted subdomains,
between which the TSSC4 and TSSC6 genes substantially escape imprinting,
due either to a lack of initial silencing or to an early developmental
relaxation of imprinting.

ANIMAL MODEL

Tarrant et al. (2002) found that Tssc6-null mice were viable and
fertile, with normal steady-state hematopoiesis. Responses to hemolysis
and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (CSF3; 138970)-induced
granulopoiesis were equivalent to those of wildtype mice. Lymphoid
development was normal, and B cells responded normally to stimulation,
but T cells showed enhanced responses to concavalin A, anti-CD3 (see
186740), and anti-CD28 (186760). Increased proliferation by Tssc6-null T
lymphocytes was due to increased IL2 (147680) production following
T-cell receptor stimulation.

609262	TITLE *609262 CEREBLON; CRBN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Higgins et al. (2004) identified a transcript, designated LOC51185,
within a candidate region for a form of autosomal recessive nonsyndromic
mental retardation (MRT2; 607417) that was mapped to chromosome
3pter-p25 in a large American family of German ancestry. The
corresponding cDNA encodes a 442-amino acid protein with a 237-residue
ATP-dependent Lon protease domain and several phosphorylation sites. The
gene was named 'cereblon' based on its putative role in cerebral
development and the large, highly conserved Lon domain. RT-PCR
demonstrated abundant expression of CRBN in the human brain.

Jo et al. (2005) cloned rat Crbn from a rat brain cDNA library. The
deduced 445-amino acid proteins shows 98% sequence identity with its
mouse ortholog. Rat Crbn contains an N-terminal domain of the Lon
protease, a RGS-like domain, a leucine zipper motif, and 4 putative
phosphorylation sites. Northern blot analysis of rat tissues detected
strong Crbn expression in brain, liver, kidney, and testis, and in situ
hybridization of rat brain showed strong expression in hippocampus,
habenula, and cortex.

GENE STRUCTURE

Higgins et al. (2004) determined that the CRBN gene contains 11 exons.

GENE FUNCTION

Ito et al. (2010) identified CRBN as a thalidomide-binding protein. CRBN
forms an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex with damaged DNA-binding protein-1
(DDB1; 600045) and CUL4A (603137) that is important for limb outgrowth
and expression of the fibroblast growth factor receptor FGF8 (600483) in
zebrafish and chicks. Thalidomide initiates its teratogenic effects by
binding to CRBN and inhibiting the associated ubiquitin ligase activity.
Ito et al. (2010) concluded that their study revealed a basis for
thalidomide teratogenicity and may contribute to the development of
thalidomide derivatives without teratogenic activity.

MAPPING

Higgins et al. (2004) identified the CRBN gene on chromosome 3pter-p25.

Jo et al. (2005) mapped the rat Crbn gene to chromosome 4q41. A mouse
ortholog was mapped to mouse chromosome 6.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of a family with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic
mental retardation, Higgins et al. (2004) identified a homozygous
arg419-to-ter mutation in the CRBN gene (R419X; 609262.0001) that
segregated with the phenotype.

ANIMAL MODEL

In rat brain, Jo et al. (2005) observed direct interaction of rat Crbn
with the cytosolic C terminus of the large conductance calcium-activated
potassium BK channel alpha-subunit (KCNMA1; 600150). Direct association
of rat Crbn with Kcnma1 was confirmed by immunoprecipitation in brain
lysate, and the 2 proteins colocalized in cultured rat hippocampal
neurons. Rat Crbn suppressed ionic currents of the channel and decreased
formation of the tetrameric BK channel complex, thus reducing surface
expression of functional channels. Jo et al. (2005) concluded that CRBN
may play an important role in modulating BK channel activity by
affecting assembly and surface expression.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MENTAL RETARDATION, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 2
CRBN, ARG419TER

In affected members of a large family with autosomal recessive
nonsyndromic mental retardation (607417) previously described by Higgins
et al. (2000), Higgins et al. (2004) identified a homozygous 1274C-T
transition in exon 11 of the CRBN gene, resulting in an arg419-to-ter
(R419X) substitution. The mutation was not detected in 400 control
chromosomes. The truncation spares the Lon domain, but disrupts an
N-myristoylation site and deletes a casein kinase-2 phosphorylation site
at the C terminus, which may prevent proper subcellular targeting. As
human Lon-containing proteins are localized to the mitochondria, where
they selectively degrade short-lived polypeptides, Higgins et al. (2004)
hypothesized that a defect in the CRBN gene may perturb nuclear
regulation of mitochondrial energy metabolism.

Using RT-PCR to examine CRBN expression in lymphoblastoid cells derived
from patients with the R419X mutation, Higgins et al. (2008) found that
R419X-mutant CRBN was expressed at levels similar to wildtype protein.
However, presence of the mutant CRBN resulted in significantly different
expression of different KCNMA1 (600150) channel isoforms. Mutant CRBN
protein was associated with persistent postnatal expression of the
KCNMA1 isoform containing a site 2 insert that is usually downregulated
in adult life. Persistence of protein isoforms with the site 2 insert
would result in BK channels with higher intracellular calcium
sensitivity, faster activation, and slower deactivation kinetics
compared to the mature isoform without the site 2 insert. Higgins et al.
(2008) postulated that such alterations could contribute to abnormal
cortical development and cognitive impairments in patients with the
mutation. The authors noted that R419X-mutant CRBN escapes
nonsense-mediated decay.

610160	TITLE *610160 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 367; ZNF367
;;ZINC FINGER PROTEIN OF FETAL LIVER ERYTHROID CELLS 29; ZFF29
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using comparative genomics, Gilligan et al. (2002) identified human
ZNF367 as an ortholog of the pufferfish Zf2 gene. The 320-amino acid
human protein shares 71% identity with Zf2, including 93% identity
within the zinc finger domains.

By PCR of fetal liver erythroid cells to identify C2H2 zinc finger
proteins that could activate transcription of fetal globin genes,
followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE, Asano et al. (2004) cloned 2
ZNF367 splice variants that they termed ZFF29a and ZFF29b. The deduced
proteins contain 306 and 350 amino acids, respectively. Both have an
N-terminal proline-rich region and 2 Kruppel-like C2H2 zinc fingers, and
ZFF29b has a C-terminal acidic region. Northern blot analysis detected
2.8- and 2.0-kb transcripts in an erythroid cell line, but expression
was weak or undetectable in adult tissues. RT-PCR analysis of mouse
tissues detected Zff29 expression in fetal liver and adult bone marrow
and ovary, with lower levels in other tissues examined. Fluorescent
microscopy demonstrated nuclear expression of both ZFF29 isoforms.

GENE FUNCTION

Using luciferase analysis, Asano et al. (2004) identified ZFF29b, but
not ZFF29a, as a potential transcriptional activator of erythroid genes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gilligan et al. (2002) determined that the ZNF367 gene contains 5 exons
and spans 63 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Gilligan et al. (2002) mapped the ZNF367
gene to chromosome 9q22.32. Asano et al. (2004) mapped ZNF367 to
chromosome 9q22.1-q31.1 by genomic sequence analysis.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for sequences similar to NGR (RTN4R; 605566), followed by
nested PCR and 5-prime RACE of a human brain cDNA library, Pignot et al.
(2003) cloned RTN4RL1, which they called NGRH2. The deduced 441-amino
acid protein contains eight 24- or 25-amino acid leucine-rich repeats
(LRRs) flanked by N- and C-terminal LRRs, and a C-terminal
glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) attachment site. NGRH2 shares 48%
similarity with NGR and 52% similarity with NGRH1 (RTN4RL2; 610462).
Northern blot analysis detected NGRH2 transcripts of 2.7 and 4 kb, with
highest expression in brain, followed by skeletal muscle and liver.
Expression was lower in other tissues examined. Probing a brain
multitissue array revealed NGRH2 highly expressed in all cerebral cortex
regions, in amygdala, hippocampus, accumbens nucleus, thalamus, and
pituitary. Weaker or no expression was detected in other brain regions.
In situ hybridization of rat brain detected Ngrh2 in several cortical
layers and in large cell bodies typical for pyramidal neurons.
Immunohistochemical analysis found Ngrh2 in neuronal cell bodies and
axons. Digestion with phospholipase C confirmed that NGRH2 has a GPI
anchor, and sucrose density fractionation of transfected Chinese hamster
ovary (CHO) cells demonstrated the association of human NGRH2 with lipid
rafts. Pignot et al. (2003) also identified a constitutively secreted
form of NGRH2 lacking the GPI anchor in CHO cell medium. Barton et al.
(2003) independently cloned human RTN4RL1, which they called NGR3, and
they cloned mouse Ngr3. By structural analysis, they found NGR3 lacked
surface residues required by NGR to assemble a neuronal signaling
complex.

GENE FUNCTION

Pignot et al. (2003) reported that NGRH2 appeared to form dimers in
lipid raft fractions of transfected CHO cells.

MAPPING

By genomic database analysis, Pignot et al. (2003) mapped the RTN4RL1
gene to chromosome 17.

;;ADENOSINE DEAMINASE, RNA-SPECIFIC, 2; ADAR2;;
RNA-EDITING ENZYME 1, RAT, HOMOLOG OF; RED1;;
RNA EDITASE 1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

RNA editing involves the deamination of adenosines at specific sites,
the result of which can be a change in the amino acid sequence of the
protein so that it differs from that predicted by the sequence of the
DNA. Editing of the glutamate receptor B (GluRB; 138247) pre-mRNA has
been shown to alter a codon (referred to as the Q/R site) for a channel
determinant that controls the calcium permeability of the AMPA glutamate
receptors. Melcher et al. (1996) tested the candidate dsRNA adenosine
deaminase DRADA (ADAR; 146920) and showed that when coexpressed with a
GluR-B minigene in HEK 293 cells, DRADA produced low-level editing at
the GluR-B Q/R site. The authors then screened a rat brain cDNA library
with the predicted catalytic domain of rat DRADA to identify other
potential editing enzymes. A cDNA encoding a predicted 711-amino acid
protein was isolated that gave about 90% of the expected activity in
their editing assay. Melcher et al. (1996) designated this novel
mammalian RNA editing protein RNA-editing enzyme-1 (RED1). Rat RED1 and
DRADA share about 31% overall identity primarily due to their
conservation in the C-terminal catalytic domain. Northern blots showed
highest expression of RED1 in rat brain. Melcher et al. (1996) further
observed that while RED1 was more efficient at deaminating some sites,
DRADA had stronger activity at others. They speculated that a
combination of these and perhaps other editing enzymes may be involved
in determining the overall editing process for a given transcript.

Mittaz et al. (1997) also cloned a human gene homologous to rat RED1.
The human gene, ADARB1, comprises 741 amino acids and contains 2
double-stranded RNA-binding domains in its N-terminal region. The
authors detected 2 transcripts of 8.8 and 4.2 kb that were strongly
expressed in brain and in many human adult and fetal tissues.

By searching for expressed sequence tags (ESTs) related to DRADA, Lai et
al. (1997) also isolated human cDNAs encoding ADARB1, which they
designated DRADA2. The DRADA2 gene is expressed ubiquitously in human
adult and fetal tissues. It has a complex transcription pattern, with 1
major 8.6-kb mRNA and several minor shorter mRNAs, some of which show
tissue specificity. Four DRADA2 isoforms, ranging in predicted size from
674 to 741 amino acids, result from alternative splicing. The isoforms
differ in their RNA editing capabilities in vitro.

GENE FUNCTION

The glutamate receptor subunit B pre-mRNA is edited at 2 adenosine
residues, resulting in amino acid changes that alter the
electrophysiologic properties of the glutamate receptor. These amino
acid changes are due to adenosine-to-inosine conversions in 2 codons
resulting from adenosine deamination. Yang et al. (1997) described the
purification and characterization of a human RNA adenosine deaminase
from HeLa cells that efficiently and accurately edits glutamate receptor
subunit B pre-mRNA at both of these sites. They concluded that the
activity reflects the human homolog of the RED1 protein, a member of the
family of double-stranded RNA-dependent deaminase proteins. O'Connell et
al. (1997) described the purification of a 90-kD protein identified as
human RED1. They showed that it edits the glutamine codon at position
586 in the pre-mRNA of the glutamate receptor B subunit.

GENE STRUCTURE

Villard et al. (1997) found that the ADARB1 gene spans approximately 25
kb and comprises 10 exons of coding sequence. The 2 RNA binding domains
are located within the 935-bp exon 2. An alternatively processed exon 6
potentially interrupts the catalytic domain. A survey of expression
patterns revealed differential processing of the 5- and 8.5-kb
transcripts in all sources examined. The difference in transcript size
appeared to result from alternative processing in the 3-prime
untranslated portion.

MAPPING

Mittaz et al. (1997) mapped the ADARB1 gene to 21q22.3 by YAC contig
analysis. See also ADARB2 (602065).

Using a cDNA fragment containing sequences homologous to the rat RED1
RNA editase gene, Villard et al. (1997) localized the human ADARB1 gene
to chromosome 21 by hybridization to a panel of somatic cell hybrids
containing subregions of 21q. This confirmed the location of RED1 in
distal 21q22.3.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Macbeth et al. (2005) reported the crystal structure of human ADAR2 at
1.7-angstrom resolution. The structure revealed a zinc ion in the active
site and suggested how the substrate adenosine is recognized.
Unexpectedly, inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) is buried within the
enzyme core, contributing to the protein fold. Although there are no
reports that adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs) require a
cofactor, Macbeth et al. (2005) showed that IP6 is required for
activity. Amino acids that coordinate IP6 in the crystal structure are
conserved in some adenosine deaminases that act on transfer RNA,
(ADATs), related enzymes that edit tRNA. Macbeth et al. (2005) showed
that IP6 is also essential for in vivo and in vitro deamination of
adenosine-37 of tRNA(alanine) (601431) by ADAT1 (604230).

ANIMAL MODEL

Higuchi et al. (2000) studied ADAR2-mediated RNA editing by generating
mice that were homozygous for a targeted functional null allele. Editing
in Adar2 -/- mice was substantially reduced at most of 25 positions in
diverse transcripts; the mutant mice became prone to seizures and died
young. The impaired phenotype appeared to result entirely from a single
underedited position, since it reverted to normal when both alleles for
the underedited transcript were substituted with alleles encoding the
edited version exonically. The critical position specifies an ion
channel determinant, the Q/R site, in AMPA receptor GluRB premessenger
RNA. Higuchi et al. (2000) concluded that this transcript is
physiologically the most important substrate of ADAR2.

SERINE/THREONINE PROTEIN KINASE 1; STK1;;
KINASE SUBUNIT OF CAK; CAK1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Levedakou et al. (1994) used degenerate PCR to clone a novel
serine/threonine protein kinase which they termed STK1. Levedakou et al.
(1994) cloned the STK1 cDNA from a human breast carcinoma cell line; the
gene encodes a 346-amino acid polypeptide. Based on amino acid sequence
analysis, Levedakou et al. (1994) considered STK1 to be the human
homolog of Xenopus MO15, a cell cycle-associated kinase. Northern blot
analysis revealed that the STK1 gene is expressed as an mRNA of 1.4 kb
in heart and several other tissues. Levedakou et al. (1994) noted that
levels of STK1 mRNA remain invariant throughout the cell cycle.

GENE FUNCTION

CDK-activating kinases (CAKs) are multisubunit proteins that
phosphorylate and thus activate certain cyclin-dependent protein kinases
in the regulation of cell cycle progression. Fisher and Morgan (1994)
purified a mammalian CAK and found that it was composed of 2 major
polypeptides: a 37-kD cyclin termed cyclin H (601953) and the 42-kD CDK7
kinase.

Shiekhattar et al. (1995) purified transcription factor IIH (TFIIH;
189972) and found that it contained material that reacted with
antibodies to CDK7 and cyclin H. The authors confirmed the presence of
the CAK complex as a distinct component of TFIIH, suggesting a link
between TFIIH (by the phosphorylation of CDC2 (116940) or CDK2 (116953))
and the processes of transcription, DNA repair, and cycle cell
progression.

Mammalian CDK8 (603184) and cyclin C (123838) are components of the RNA
polymerase II holoenzyme complex, where they function as a protein
kinase that phosphorylates the C-terminal domain of the largest subunit
of RNA polymerase II. The CDK8/cyclin C protein complex is also found in
a number of mammalian 'Mediator'-like protein complexes, which repress
activated transcription independently of the C-terminal domain in vitro.
Akoulitchev et al. (2000) demonstrated that CDK8/cyclin C can regulate
transcription by targeting the CDK7/cyclin H subunits of TFIIH. CDK8
phosphorylates mammalian cyclin H at serine 5 and serine 304 both in
vitro and in vivo, in the vicinity of its functionally unique N- and
C-terminal alpha-helical domains. This phosphorylation represses both
the ability of TFIIH to activate transcription and its C-terminal kinase
activity. In addition, mimicking CDK8 phosphorylation of cyclin H in
vivo has a dominant-negative effect on cell growth. Akoulitchev et al.
(2000) concluded that their results linked the Mediator complex and the
basal transcription machinery by a regulatory pathway involving 2
cyclin-dependent kinases. This pathway appears to be unique to higher
organisms.

The CDK-activating kinase, or CAK complex, consists of CDK7, cyclin H,
and MAT1 (602659). As the kinase subunit of TFIIH, CDK7 participates in
basal transcription by phosphorylating the carboxy-terminal domain of
the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II. As part of CAK, CDK7 also
phosphorylates other CDKs, an essential step for their activation. Chen
et al. (2003) showed that the Drosophila TFIIH component Xpd, whose
human homolog is ERCC2 (126340), negatively regulates the cell cycle
function of Cdk7, the CAK activity. Excess Xpd titrated CAK activity,
resulting in decreased Cdk T-loop phosphorylation, mitotic defects, and
lethality, whereas a decrease in Xpd resulted in increased CAK activity
and cell proliferation. Moreover, Chen et al. (2003) showed that Xpd is
downregulated at the beginning of mitosis when Cdk1 (116940), a cell
cycle target of Cdk7, is most active. Downregulation of Xpd thus seems
to contribute to the upregulation of mitotic CAK activity and to
regulate mitotic progression positively. Chen et al. (2003) concluded
that the downregulation of Xpd might be a major mechanism of mitotic
silencing of basal transcription.

Larochelle et al. (2007) replaced wildtype CDK7 in a human colon
carcinoma cell line with a mutant CDK7 sensitive to inhibition by a
nonhydrolyzable ATP analog. Selective inhibition of CDK7 in synchronized
cells during G1 prevented activation, but not formation, of CDK2/cyclin
complexes and delayed entry into S phase. Inhibition of CDK7 in G2
blocked entry into mitosis and disrupted CDK1 (CDC2)/cyclin B (CCNB1;
123836) complex assembly. Larochelle et al. (2007) concluded that CDK7
functions in both cyclin binding and T-loop phosphorylation and that
these 2 steps of CDK1 activation are mutually dependent.

MAPPING

By PCR amplification on DNA from a panel of monochromosomal human-rodent
hybrids, Levedakou et al. (1994) mapped the CDK7 gene to chromosome
2p15-cen.

252800	TITLE *252800 ALPHA-L-IDURONIDASE; IDUA
;;IDURONIDASE, ALPHA-L
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA; EC 3.2.1.76), the enzyme deficient in MPS I
(see 607014, 607015, and 607016), hydrolyzes the terminal
alpha-L-iduronic acid residues of the glycosaminoglycans dermatan
sulfate and of heparan sulfate (Neufeld and Muenzer, 2001). It was
originally defined as the 'Hurler corrective factor' (Barton and
Neufeld, 1971).

CLONING

Scott et al. (1990) used amino acid sequence data from purified human
liver IDUA (Clements et al., 1989) to isolate both a genomic clone and a
cDNA clone for IDUA. Scott et al. (1991) isolated and sequenced cDNA
clones containing part of the human IDUA coding region and used PCR from
reverse-transcribed RNA to obtain the full IDUA sequence. Analysis of
the predicted 653-amino acid precursor protein showed that IDUA has a
26-amino acid signal peptide that is cleaved immediately before the
amino terminus of the 74-kD polypeptide present in human liver IDUA. The
protein sequence contains 6 potential N-glycosylation sites. Evidence of
alternatively spliced mRNA from the IDUA gene was found in fibroblasts,
liver, kidney, and placental RNA.

GENE STRUCTURE

Scott et al. (1992) demonstrated that the IDUA gene spans approximately
19 kb and contains 14 exons. The first 2 exons are separated by an
intron of 566 bp; a large intron of approximately 13 kb follows, and the
last 12 exons are clustered within 4.5 kb.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization and Southern blot analysis of mouse-human cell
hybrids, Scott et al. (1990) determined that the IDUA gene maps to
4p16.3, not to chromosome 22 as earlier reported by Schuchman et al.
(1982, 1984). Scott et al. (1990) confirmed the presence of human IDUA
activity in human-mouse cell hybrids by using a monoclonal antibody
specific to human IDUA. Scott et al. (1992) found that the polymorphic
locus D4S111 used in the diagnosis of Huntington disease (143100) is the
consequence of an 86-bp variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) within the
IDUA gene. The gene mapped to chromosome 22 by Schuchman et al. (1982,
1984) by use of a polyclonal antibody in human-mouse cell hybrids may
have been a crossreacting protein.

Grosson et al. (1994) mapped the homologous locus in the mouse, Idua, to
chromosome 5 in a continuous linkage group that included the homolog of
the Huntington disease gene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Scott et al. (1990) failed to detect major deletions or gene
rearrangements in the IDUA gene in any of the 40 MPS I patients studied
by Southern blot analysis.

Scott et al. (1992) reported the presence of a common mutation
accounting for 31% of MPS I alleles in a study of 64 MPS I patients.
Chemical cleavage and then direct PCR sequencing detected the mutation.
The mutation is a single base substitution that introduces a stop codon
at position 402 (W402X; 252800.0001) of the alpha-L-iduronidase protein
and is associated with an extremely severe clinical phenotype in
homozygotes. Patients who are compound heterozygotes having one allele
carrying the W401X mutation have a wide range of clinical phenotypes.

Scott et al. (1992) identified 2 additional mutations, one that
introduces a stop codon at position 70 (Q70X; 252800.0002) and the other
that alters the proline at position 533 to an arginine (P533R;
252800.0003) in the 653 amino acid alpha-L-iduronidase protein.
Allele-specific oligonucleotides were used to detect the mutations in a
group of 73 MPS I patients and Q70X was found to account for 15% of all
MPS I alleles and P533R for 3% of MPS I alleles. Both mutations are
associated with an extremely severe clinical phenotype in homozygotes.
MPS I patients heterozygous for either mutation may have a wide range of
clinical phenotypes. Mutations W402X (Scott et al., 1992), Q70X, and
P533R accounted for 53% of MPS I alleles, which together define 28% of
MPS I genotypes.

Bunge et al. (1995) identified 13 novel and 7 previously reported
mutations of the IDUA gene, covering 88% of mutant alleles and 86% of
genotypes, in a total of 29 patients with MPS I of differing clinical
severity.

Scott et al. (1995) stated that 46 disease-producing mutations and 30
polymorphisms had been identified in the IDUA gene. In a mutation
analysis of 85 mucopolysaccharidosis families (73 Hurler, 5
Hurler/Scheie, 7 Scheie), Beesley et al. (2001) identified 165 of the
170 mutant alleles. The 85 MPS I families were screened for 9 known
mutations. W420X was the most frequent mutation in their population
(43.3%) and Q70X was the second most frequent (15.9%). In 30 families,
either one or both of the mutations were not identified, which accounted
for 25.9% of the total alleles. All 14 exons of the alpha-L-iduronidase
gene were then screened in those patients and 23 different sequence
changes were found, 17 of which were previously unknown. The novel
sequence changes included 4 deletions, 6 missense mutations, a splice
site mutation, and a rare polymorphism.

Alleles that cause the milder phenotypes, Hurler/Scheie and Scheie
syndromes, are often missense mutations. Tieu et al. (1995) reported 4
novel mutations of the IDUA gene in 1 patient with the Scheie syndrome
and in 3 patients with the Hurler/Scheie syndrome. The novel mutations,
all single base changes, encoded the substitutions R492P (252800.00011)
(Scheie) and X654G (252800.0013), P496L, and L490P (252800.0012)
(Hurler/Scheie). The L490P mutation was apparently homozygous, whereas
each of the others was found in compound heterozygosity with a Hurler
mutation. The deleterious nature of the mutations was confirmed by
absence of enzyme activity upon transfection of the corresponding
mutagenized cDNAs into COS-1 cells.

Aronovich et al. (1996) described the molecular defect underlying IDUA
pseudodeficiency. The study was prompted by a patient who appeared to
have, by biochemical study, both MPS I and MPS II. The common IDS
mutation R468W (309900.0012) was found in the proband, his mother, and
his sister, confirming transmission of Hunter syndrome. Additionally,
the proband, his sister, and his father were found to be heterozygous
for a common IDUA mutation, W402X (252800.0001). Notably, a new IDUA
mutation, A300T (252800.0016), was identified in the proband, his
sister, and his mother, accounting for reduced IDUA activity in these
individuals. The proband's sister was asymptomatic and her cells
demonstrated normal glycosaminoglycan metabolism, thus demonstrating
that the W402X/A300T compound heterozygous genotype is an IDUA
pseudodeficiency state.

POPULATION GENETICS

Bunge et al. (1994) screened 46 European patients with
mucopolysaccharidosis type I for mutations in the IDUA gene. The 2
common nonsense mutations, W402X and Q70X, were identified in 37% and
35% of mutant alleles, respectively. Considerable differences were seen
in the frequency of these 2 mutations in patients from northern Europe
(Norway and Finland) and other European countries (mainly the
Netherlands and Germany). In Scandinavia, W402X and Q70X accounted for
17% and 62% of the MPS I alleles, respectively, whereas in other
European countries W402X was about 2.5 times more frequent (48%) than
Q70X (19%).

Gatti et al. (1997) screened 27 Italian MPS I patients for IDUA
mutations. Mutations were found in 18 patients, with 28 alleles
identified. The 2 common mutations in northern Europeans (W402X and
Q70X) accounted for only 11% and 13% of the alleles, respectively. The
R89Q i(252800.0015) mutation, uncommon in Europeans, was found in 1
patient, accounting for 1 of 54 alleles (1.9%). The P533R, A327P and
G51D mutations accounted for 11%, 5.6%, and 9.3% of the total alleles,
respectively. The P533R mutation was relatively frequent in Sicily.

In a study of Israeli-Arab MPS I patients, Bach et al. (1993) identified
4 alleles, none of which had been found in Europeans. In all instances,
the probands were homozygous and the parents heterozygous for the mutant
alleles, as anticipated from the consanguinity in each family. One
allele had 2 amino acid substitutions and was identified in a family
from Gaza. The 3 single-substitution alleles were found in 7 families, 5
of them Druze, residing in a very small area of northern Israel,
suggesting a founder effect.

Yamagishi et al. (1996) studied mutations in the IDUA gene from 19
Japanese MPS I patients, including 2 pairs of sibs, with various
clinical phenotypes (Hurler, 6 cases; Hurler/Scheie, 7 cases; Scheie, 6
cases). Two common mutations accounted for 42% of the 38 alleles in
their patients: a novel 5-bp insertion (704ins5; 252800.0014), which had
not been found other populations, accounted for 18%, and an R89Q
mutation, found uncommonly in Caucasians, accounted for 24%. None of the
patients carried W402X or the Q79X mutations commonly found in
Caucasians. Homozygosity for the 704ins5 mutation was associated with a
severe phenotype, and the R89Q mutation was associated with a mild
phenotype. Compound heterozygosity for these 2 mutations produced an
intermediate phenotype. Haplotype analysis using polymorphisms linked to
the IDUA locus demonstrated that each mutation occurs on a different
specific haplotype, suggesting that individuals with each of these
common mutations derive from common founders. The data documented the
molecular heterogeneity and racial differences in mutations in MPS I.

Li et al. (2002) screened 22 unrelated MPS I patients from the United
States and identified 11 different mutations in the IDUA gene, including
4 novel ones. The Q70X mutation (252800.0002) was found in 30% of
alleles and the W402X mutation (252800.0001) was identified in 39% of
alleles.

Lee et al. (2004) performed mutation analysis of the IDUA gene in 10
unrelated Korean patients with the various clinical phenotypes of MPS I
and identified 7 different mutations, 4 of which were novel. The 704ins5
mutation (252800.0014) was found in 4 patients and the L346R mutation
(252800.0020) in 6. These 2 mutations accounted for half the mutations
found in Korean MPS I patients.

ANIMAL MODEL

Stoltzfus et al. (1992) cloned and characterized cDNA encoding the
canine alpha-L-iduronidase and demonstrated mRNA deficiency in the MPS I
dog. Menon et al. (1992) demonstrated that the canine IDUA gene has 14
exons spread over 13 kb. An unusual GC dinucleotide was found at the
donor splice site of intron 11. A transcriptional start site was
identified by primer extension 177 bp upstream of the initiator AUG
codon. The upstream region was found to be similar to the promoter
region of many housekeeping genes: it is GC rich and has 7 potential Sp1
binding sites but no TATA box or CAAT motif. The mutation in canine MPS
I was found to be a G-to-A transition in the donor splice site in intron
1. The mutation caused retention of intron 1 in the RNA and created a
premature termination codon at the exon-intron junction.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HURLER SYNDROME
IDUA, TRP402TER

Scott et al. (1992) found that 31% of MPS I alleles in a study of 64
patients with Hurler syndrome had a trp402-to-ter substitution in the
alpha-L-iduronidase protein associated with very severe clinical
phenotype in homozygotes. A G-to-A transition at nucleotide 1293 altered
the trp-402 codon (TGG) to a stop codon (TAG); translation was
terminated approximately two-thirds of the way through the 653-amino
acid IDUA protein. The mutation was originally detected by chemical
cleavage and then by direct PCR sequencing. The patients who were
compound heterozygotes for the allele had a wide range of clinical
phenotypes. Based on polymorphisms within the IDUA gene, Scott et al.
(1992) determined that the trp402-to-ter mutation is associated with 3
different haplotypes, implying more than one origin for the mutation or
intragenic recombination. The mutation introduced a MaeI restriction
endonuclease site into the gene, thus enabling simple detection of the
mutation. Assessment of the efficacy of bone marrow transplantation in
patients homozygous for the mutation is thus possible.

Significantly, the index case of Scheie syndrome reported by McKusick et
al. (1965), who had been assumed to be a homozygote for a separate
allele at the IDUA locus, was found in fact to be a compound
heterozygote for the W402X allele. Biochemically, GM1323 fibroblasts had
no detectable IDUA protein using 2 different IDUA monoclonal antibodies.
They had approximately 0.3% of IDUA activity. This IDUA activity must
result from a mild mutation in the other MPS I allele present in the
patient. Subsequently, with definition of the mutation in the other
allele (see 252800.0004), this proved to be the case. Beesley et al.
(2001) found that W402X accounted for 45.3% of mutant alleles in their
study.

.0002
HURLER SYNDROME
IDUA, GLN70TER

By chemical cleavage followed by direct PCR sequencing, Scott et al.
(1992) detected and characterized a nonsense mutation, a C-to-T
transition at nucleotide 296, that altered a gln codon at position 70
(CAG) to a stop codon (TAG). The termination of translation occurred
soon after the mature 74-kD amino terminus of the IDUA protein. Using
allele-specific oligonucleotides to detect mutations in a group of 73
MPS I patients, the Q70X mutation was found to account for 15% of all
MPS I alleles. The mutation was associated with an extremely severe
clinical phenotype in homozygotes. Patients who were compound
heterozygotes showed a wide range of clinical phenotypes. Beesley et al.
(2001) found that Q70X accounted for 15.9% of alleles in their large
study.

.0003
HURLER SYNDROME
IDUA, PRO533ARG

By chemical cleavage analysis followed by direct PCR sequencing, Scott
et al. (1992) detected an alteration of the proline at position 533 to
an arginine in the 653-amino acid alpha-L-iduronidase protein. Using
allele-specific oligonucleotides to screen for the mutation in a group
of 73 MPS I patients, they found that the P533R mutation accounted for
3% of alleles. Homozygotes for the P533R mutation showed an extremely
severe clinical phenotype; compound heterozygotes showed a wide range of
clinical phenotypes. Scott et al. (1992) found that 3 mutations, W402X,
Q70X, and P533R, were responsible for 53% of MPS I alleles, which
together defined 28% of MPS I genotypes.

Using fluorescence-assisted mismatch analysis (FAMA) and cycle
sequencing of the PCR products, Alif et al. (1999) screened for
mutations in the IDUA gene in a group of 13 Moroccan patients with MPS I
and their families, including 3 sibs and twin sibs. The P553R mutation,
which is rare in Europeans, was identified in 92% of mutant alleles (24
of 26). This was said to be the highest frequency of this mutation
detected in patients with Hurler syndrome. None of the patients carried
the W402X (252800.0001) or the Q70X (252800.0002) allele, the most
common MPS I mutations in Europeans.

.0004
SCHEIE SYNDROME
IDUA, IVS5AS, G-A, -7

In the fibroblast strain GM01323 derived from the index case of the
Scheie syndrome (607016) reported by McKusick et al. (1965) and in a
second cell line, GM01256, Moskowitz et al. (1993) found compound
heterozygosity for the same 2 mutations: a G-to-A transition in intron
5, in position -7 from exon 6, and a W402X change (TGG to TAG) in exon
9. The latter mutation, trp402-to-ter (252800.0001), had previously been
identified as a common MPS I mutation in the Caucasian population,
present in homozygosity in some Hurler patients and in compound
heterozygosity in patients with any form of MPS I, including the Scheie
patient GM01323 (Scott et al., 1992). Moskowitz et al. (1993) proposed
that the intron 5 mutation was responsible for the Scheie phenotype in
these 2 patients. The mutation created a new acceptor splice site,
causing 5 intronic nucleotides to be inserted into mRNA; this
out-of-frame insertion led to an almost immediate termination codon.
Additional splicing of transcripts of one or both alleles at some
upstream cryptic site(s) was found. Since the normal splice site was not
obliterated by the intron 5 mutation, its use would allow the synthesis
of some completely normal enzyme. An analogous situation had been
encountered in the HEXB gene (268800); mutations that create a new
splice site without destroying the old one, thereby permitting
expression of some functional beta-hexosaminidase, had been found in a
patient with juvenile Sandhoff disease (Nakano and Suzuki, 1989) and in
an individual with the asymptomatic 'hexosaminidase Paris' (Dlott et
al., 1990) phenotype. Indeed, Ashton et al. (1992) and Scott et al.
(1992) found a low level of immunoprecipitable alpha-L-iduronidase
activity with normal K(m) and with probably normal specific activity in
the Scheie fibroblast cell line GM01323. Although McKusick et al. (1972)
suggested that the Scheie syndrome may represent homozygosity for a mild
disease allele, based on the paradigm of hemoglobinopathies SS, CC and
SC, molecular studies in lysosomal storage diseases, especially the GM2
gangliosidoses (272800) and Gaucher disease (230800), demonstrate the
presence of multiple mutant alleles at each disease locus and the
occurrence of compound heterozygosity as well as homozygosity in the
milder phenotypes. The findings demonstrate that just one allele, if it
permits residual enzyme activity, can protect from severe disease
(Neufeld, 1991). Scheie syndrome must be genetically heterogeneous
inasmuch as 2 other patients with this phenotype did not have the intron
5 allele. One wonders what the homozygote for this IVS5AS mutation might
show phenotypically; the abnormalities might be relatively mild and late
in onset, if present at all. By chemical cleavage and direct PCR
sequencing, Scott et al. (1993) also found the mutation, which they
referred to as 678-7g-to-a, in association with W402X in the index case
of McKusick et al. (1965). Scott et al. (1993) concluded that since the
W402X allele in other combinations is associated with severe disease,
the splice acceptor site mutation is likely to be responsible for the
mild clinical phenotype because it allows a very small amount of normal
mRNA to be produced.

.0005
HURLER SYNDROME
IDUA, GLY409ARG AND TER654CYS

In a patient with Hurler syndrome (607014) in a consanguineous Muslim
Arab family in Gaza, Bach et al. (1993) observed homozygosity for an
IDUA allele containing 2 amino acid substitutions: a G-to-C transversion
in exon 9 converting codon 409 from GGG (gly) to CGG (arg), and an
A-to-T transversion in the termination codon 654 (TGA), converting it to
a cys (TGT) residue. The cDNA sequence predicted an extension of 38
amino acids before the next termination codon was reached. Both
mutations were found in heterozygous form in the DNA of each parent.
Expression of cDNA mutagenized at one or both positions showed that
gly409-to-arg caused a reduction of less than half the
alpha-L-iduronidase activity, whereas the ter-to-cys mutation reduced
activity by 98% compared with expression of normal cDNA.

.0006
HURLER SYNDROME
IDUA, TYR64TER

Schaap and Bach (1980) found 13 Arab patients with Hurler syndrome
(607014) but only 1 Jewish patient in Israel where ascertainment of the
disorder had been complete for 15 years. The mutation in the Jewish
patient was the deletion/insertion mutation described by Moskowitz et
al. (1993). The Arab patients came from 8 families, 5 of which were
Druze and 3 Muslim. Unexpectedly, Bach et al. (1993) found homozygosity
for 3 different mutations distributed in 7 families, 5 of them Druze:
mutations in exon 2 (tyr64-to-ter), exon 7 (gln310-to-ter; 252800.0007),
and exon 8 (thr366-to-pro; 252800.0008). Transfection of mutagenized
cDNA into COS-1 cells showed that the missense mutation thr366-to-pro
permitted the expression of only trace amounts of alpha-L-iduronidase
activity. The nonsense mutations were associated with abnormalities of
RNA processing. The tyr64-to-ter mutation was accompanied by a very low
level of mRNA and skipping of exon 2. Utilization of a cryptic splice
site was observed with the gln310-to-ter mutation. The Druze and Muslim
Arab populations have been separated by religion since the inception of
the Ismalia or Druze religion in Egypt in the 11th century A.D. At
present the Druze live in a defined geographic area of southern Syria,
southern Lebanon, and northern Israel; they maintain an isolated social
structure with a high rate of consanguineous marriages. The Druze
population in Israel numbers about 60,000. Bach et al. (1993)
anticipated that MPS in the Druze population would be caused by 1
founder mutation which might or might not be shared with the Muslim
patients residing in the surrounding area. They were surprised to find
that, in fact, there were 3 different mutations.

In a patient with a severe form of the Hurler syndrome, Scott et al.
(1993) found that the Q70X (252800.0002) mutation was combined with an
allele carrying a deletion of a single G residue at cDNA base 1702,
resulting in a frameshift.

HURLER SYNDROME
IDUA, ARG621TER

Bunge et al. (1994) identified an R621X mutation due to a CGA-to-TGA
transition in a patient with Hurler syndrome (607014). The patient was a
compound heterozygote, the other allele being the common W402X mutation
(252800.0001).

.0011
SCHEIE SYNDROME
IDUA, ARG492PRO

In a patient with Scheie syndrome (607016), Tieu et al. (1995) found a
heterozygous G-to-C transversion in codon 492, corresponding to a change
of arginine (CGG) to proline (CCG). The mutation, which created an ApaI
site, was inherited from the patient's mother. No alpha-L-iduronidase
activity was observed when cDNA mutagenized to have the R492P mutation
was expressed in COS-1 cells. Even though no activity was observed, this
mutation must be presumed responsible for the mild Scheie phenotype,
since the other allele carried the gln70-to-ter Hurler mutation
associated with severe disease (252800.0002). This was the third
mutation to be described in the Scheie syndrome; in each case, there was
compound heterozygosity for a common Hurler mutation.

.0012
HURLER-SCHEIE SYNDROME
IDUA, LEU490PRO

Tieu et al. (1995) demonstrated that the Hurler/Scheie (607015) cell
line GM00512 had a T-to-C transition in codon 490, converting leucine
(CTG) to proline (CCG), and creating a SmaI site. No alpha-L-iduronidase
activity was detected when cDNA containing the L490P mutation was
expressed in COS-1 cells. There was no evidence for heterozygosity
either in the genomic sequence or in the restriction digest, suggesting
that the mutation was present in homozygous form. However, hemizygosity,
because of either deletion of the IDUA gene on 1 chromosome or
uniparental disomy, had not been ruled out. The GM00512 cell line was
derived from a patient of Asian Indian origin, whose parents were not
known to be consanguineous. Homozygosity had been observed previously
only in consanguineous families or for the most common mutations, W402X
(252800.0001) and Q70X (252800.0002). It is therefore possible that the
L490P mutation is relatively common among Indian MPS I patients.

.0013
HURLER-SCHEIE SYNDROME
IDUA, TER654GLY

In a patient with Hurler/Scheie syndrome (607015), Tieu et al. (1995)
observed a heterozygous T-to-G transversion that changed the termination
codon (TGA) to glycine (GGA), which predicted an extension of 38 amino
acids at the carboxyl terminus of alpha-L-iduronidase. The mutation,
which created a BstNI site, was inherited from the mother. A very low
level of alpha-L-iduronidase activity was observed when the mutagenized
cDNA was expressed in COS-1 cells. This mutation must have been
responsible for the Hurler/Scheie phenotype, as the other allele carried
the Q70X Hurler mutation (252800.0002). Another mutation in the
termination codon, X654C, had previously been observed in cells of a
patient (GM01898) whose phenotype could not be clearly classified as
either Hurler or Hurler/Scheie (Bach et al., 1993).

HURLER SYNDROME
IDUA, 5-BP INS, NT704

In the study of 19 Japanese MPS I patients with various clinical
phenotypes, Yamagishi et al. (1996) found that a 5-bp insertion between
the T at nucleotide 704 and the C at nucleotide 705 accounted for 7 of
38 alleles (18%). This mutation had been found in no Caucasian patients.
It was associated with a specific haplotype, suggesting to the authors
that the individuals with the mutation derived from a common ancestor.
Homozygosity of the 704ins5 mutation was associated with a severe
phenotype.

Lee et al. (2004) found the 705ins5 mutation in 4 of 10 unrelated Korean
patients with MPS I. All occurred in compound heterozygous state in
patients with Hurler syndrome (607014).

HURLER-SCHEIE SYNDROME
IDUA, ARG89GLN

In the study of 19 Japanese MPS I patients with various clinical
phenotypes, Yamagishi et al. (1996) found that the R89Q mutation
accounted for 9 of 38 alleles (24%). Homozygosity for the R89Q mutation
was associated with a mild phenotype. Compound heterozygosity for this
and the 704ins5 mutation (252800.0014) produced an intermediate
phenotype (607015). Haplotype analysis using polymorphisms linked to the
IDUA locus demonstrated that the mutation occurred on a specific
haplotype, suggesting to the authors that individuals with the mutation
derived from a common ancestor. Of 3 homozygotes, 1 died of congestive
heart failure at the age of 48 years. One of the heterozygotes died of
the same at 31 years. She was 117 cm tall. Scott et al. (1993) had
previously described the R89Q mutation in a compound heterozygous
Caucasian patient.

IDUA PSEUDODEFICIENCY
IDUA, ALA300THR

In a healthy female, Aronovich et al. (1996) found compound
heterozygosity for the W402X mutation (252800.0001) and a new IDUA
mutation, A300T. Although fibroblasts from the patient demonstrated
normal glycosaminoglycan metabolism, enzyme studies using artificial
substrate showed very low levels of alpha-L-iduronidase activity. This
was said to have been the first IDUA pseudodeficiency gene to be
elucidated at the molecular level.

In an 18-year-old Chinese patient with intermediate phenotype consistent

at nucleotide 1943.

HURLER-SCHEIE SYNDROME
IDUA, IVS2AS, C-G, -3

In a Chinese patient with Hurler/Scheie syndrome (607015), Teng et al.
(2000) identified compound heterozygosity for a maternal allele with a
leu346-to-arg (L346R; 252800.0020) mutation (T-to-G transversion in
codon 346) and a paternal allele with a C-to-G transversion at position
-3 of the 3-prime splice acceptor site of intron 2. In transfected COS-7
cells, L346R showed no appreciable IDUA activity, although it did not
cause an apparent reduction in IDUA mRNA or protein level. The splice
acceptor site mutation profoundly affected normal splicing leading to a
very unstable mRNA. Expression of IDUA cDNA containing the mutated
acceptor splice site showed trace amounts of enzyme activity (1.6% of
normal activity). The results provided further support for the
importance of cytosine at the -3 position in RNA processing. The patient
reported by Teng et al. (2000) was 12 years old with short stature,
macrocephaly, coarse face, corneal clouding, skeletal deformities, and
hepatosplenomegaly, but normal intelligence. Other mild clinical
features included hearing impairment, tracheal stenosis, hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy, obstructive-type sleep apnea, adenoid hyperplasia,
tonsil hypertrophy, umbilical hernia, anemia,

611639	TITLE *611639 ZINC FINGER GATA-LIKE PROTEIN 1; ZGLP1
;;GATA-LIKE PROTEIN 1; GLP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database searching with the sequence of the mouse GATA6 (601656) zinc
finger motif as query, Li et al. (2007) identified a novel nuclear zinc
finger protein in mouse and human, which they designated GATA-like
protein-1 (GLP1). The deduced 271-amino acid human and 266-amino acid
mouse GLP1 proteins have 2 highly conserved zinc finger regions.
Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization demonstrated restricted
expression of mouse Glp1 in somatic cells of the developing gonads,
including Leydig cells in the testes and granulosa cells in the ovaries.

GENE FUNCTION

Using cotransfection experiments and deletion analysis, Li et al. (2007)
demonstrated that GLP1 acts as a transcriptional repressor of GATA6 and
that this function requires the 2 GLP1 zinc fingers. Li et al. (2007)
found that knockout Glp1 mice were viable with no detectable organ
defects but were infertile. Loss of Glp1 resulted in defective sperm
development and a marked reduction in mature spermatids. In females,
loss of Glp1 led to a severe block in germ cell development that was
observed as early as embryonic day 17.5. Li et al. (2007) concluded that
GLP1 is a critical nuclear repressor in somatic cells of the gonad that
is required for germ cell development.

603620	TITLE *603620 PC4- AND SFRS1-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1; PSIP1
;;TRANSCRIPTIONAL COACTIVATOR p75; p75;;
LENS EPITHELIUM-DERIVED GROWTH FACTOR; LEDGF
TRANSCRIPTIONAL COACTIVATOR p52, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Transcriptional activation in human cell-free systems containing RNA
polymerase II and general initiation factors requires the action of one
or more additional coactivators. Ge et al. (1998) reported the isolation
of cDNAs encoding 2 novel human transcriptional coactivators (p52 and
p75) that are derived from alternatively spliced products of a single
gene and share a region of 325 residues, but show distinct coactivator
properties.

By immunoscreening a human lens epithelial cell cDNA library with
antibodies from a cataract patient, Singh et al. (2000) isolated a cDNA
encoding a protein that they named 'lens epithelium-derived growth
factor' (LEDGF). They determined that LEDGF is identical to p75, a
coactivator of both transcription and pre-mRNA splicing.

GENE STRUCTURE

Singh et al. (2000) found that the LEDGF gene contains at least 15 exons
and encodes LEDGF mRNA and p52 mRNA. Exons 1 through 15 encode LEDGF
mRNA; exons 1 through 9 and part of intron 9 encode p52.

GENE FUNCTION

Ge et al. (1998) demonstrated strong interactions of both p52 and p75
with the VP16 activation domain and several components of the general
transcriptional machinery. p52 is a potent broad-specificity
coactivator, whereas p75 is less active for most activation domains.

Ge et al. (1998) found that p52 interacts not only with transcriptional
activators and general transcription factors to enhance activated
transcription, but also with the essential splicing factor ASF/SF2 both
in vitro and in vivo to modulate ASF/SF2-mediated pre-mRNA splicing.
Immunofluorescence studies indicated that the majority of endogenous p52
is colocalized with ASF/SF2 in the nucleoplasm of HeLa cells. These
observations suggested that, in addition to functioning as a
transcriptional coactivator, p52 may also act as an adaptor to
coordinate pre-mRNA splicing and transcriptional activation of class II
genes.

Singh et al. (2000) observed that in serum-free medium, LEDGF stimulated
growth of lens epithelial cells, COS-7 cells, skin fibroblasts, and
keratinocytes, and prolonged survival of these cell lines. Antibodies
against LEDGF blocked cell growth and caused cell death. Singh et al.
(2000) concluded that LEDGF, a regulatory factor, might play an
important role in the growth and survival of a wide range of cell types.

Singh et al. (2000) found almost equal amounts of LEDGF/p75 and p52
expressed in lens epithelial cells in culture.

Nakamura et al. (2000) studied the effects of LEDGF on survival of
embryonic chick retinal photoreceptor cells under serum starvation and
heat stress. Immunohistochemistry detected LEDGF expression
predominantly in the nucleus of neuroretinal cells, including
photoreceptor cells. In the presence of LEDGF, photoreceptor cells
showed increased resistance to serum starvation and heat stress and
survived for longer periods. Levels of heat shock protein-90 (see
140571) were elevated in LEDGF-treated cells. Most retinal cells died in
the absence of LEDGF. They authors concluded that LEDGF enhanced
survival of retinal photoreceptor cells under serum starvation and heat
stress.

Machida et al. (2001) found that LEDGF protected photoreceptor structure
and function in both light-damaged and RCS rats (see 604705). However,
LEDGF failed to rescue photoreceptors in a transgenic rat model of human
retinitis pigmentosa (268000) carrying a P23H mutation in rhodopsin
(180380.0001).

Ciuffi et al. (2005) noted that LEDGF binds both chromosomal DNA and
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) integrase, suggesting that it might
direct HIV integration by a tethering interaction. They found that
treatment of kidney and T-cell lines with short hairpin RNAs to achieve
a strong knockdown of LEDGF resulted in a reduction of HIV integration
in transcription units (i.e., genes) compared with control cells.
Likewise, genes regulated by LEDGF were preferred integration sites.
Knockdown of LEDGF also resulted in increased HIV integration in
chromosomal regions with higher GC content, possibly due to LEDGF
binding preferentially in AT-rich chromosomal regions. Ciuffi et al.
(2005) proposed that LEDGF becomes enriched on genes by binding
components of the transcriptional apparatus, thereby positioning itself
to target HIV integration to these sites.

Llano et al. (2006) used intensified RNA interference and
dominant-negative protein approaches to show that the cellular
transcriptional coactivator lens epithelium-derived growth factor
LEDGF/p75 is an essential HIV integration cofactor. The mechanism
requires both linkages of a molecular tether that p75 forms between
integrase and chromatin. Fractionally minute levels of endogenous p75
are sufficient to enable integration, showing that cellular factors that
engage HIV after entry may elude identification in less intensive
knockdowns.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Cherepanov et al. (2005) reported the crystal structure of the dimeric
catalytic core domain of HIV-1 integrase complexed to the
integrase-binding domain of LEDGF at 2-angstrom resolution. The
structure elucidated the mode of recognition between the 2 proteins and
revealed a potential target site on the integrase for the design of
small molecule inhibitors to block the interaction.

MAPPING

By FISH, Singh et al. (2000) mapped the LEDGF gene to chromosome 9p22.2.
They noted that the 9p22-p21 region is the site of chromosomal
abnormalities in a variety of malignancies, including leukemia, glioma,
lung cancer, and melanoma.

615003	TITLE *615003 DDHD DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; DDHD2
;;KIAA0725
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The DDHD2 gene encodes a phospholipase that hydrolyzes sn-1 ester bonds
of phospholipids, producing 2-acyl-lysophospholipids and fatty acids.
DDHD2 prefers phosphatidic acid as substrate and has a role in efficient
membrane trafficking from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane
(summary by Sato et al., 2010).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) obtained a partial DDHD2 clone, which they
designated KIAA0725. RT-PCR ELISA detected variable DDHD2 expression in
all human tissues examined, with highest expression in brain, followed
by heart, lung, ovary, and testis, much lower expression in kidney,
liver, skeletal muscle, and pancreas, and little to none in spleen.

Using 5-prime RACE of a placenta cDNA library to extend KIAA0725,
Nakajima et al. (2002) obtained a full-length KIAA0725 clone. The
deduced 711-amino acid has a central consensus lipase signature motif,
Gly-X-Ser-X-Gly, and a calculated molecular mass of 81 kD. Northern blot
analysis detected a major transcript of 5.4 kb and a minor transcript of
2.8 kb in all human tissues examined, with highest expression in heart,
brain, skeletal muscle, and testis. Epitope-tagged KIAA0725 was
expressed in punctate structures and large aggregates that partly
overlapped with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi markers.

Using immunofluorescence microscopy and photobleaching experiments, Sato
et al. (2010) showed that HeLa cell KIAA0725 rapidly cycled between the
perinuclear cis-Golgi and cytosol.

Inoue et al. (2012) described the domain structure of the full-length
711-amino acid KIAA0725. It has an N-terminal WWE domain predicted to
mediate protein-protein interaction, followed by a PI-PLC-X domain, a
lipase motif, a SAM domain, and a C-terminal DDHD domain. KIAA0725
localized to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and ER exit
sites.

Schuurs-Hoeijmakers et al. (2012) found high expression of the DDHD2
gene in multiple human brain regions, including the cerebellum, cortex,
hippocampus, and thalamus. Expression in the brain was about 10-fold
higher than in other human tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Nakajima et al. (2002) showed that soluble cytosolic KIAA0725 expressed
in mammalian cells cleaved the ester linkage at the sn-1 position of
phosphatidic acid in the presence or absence of Triton X-100. It also
hydrolyzed phosphatidylethanolamine, but only in the absence of Triton
X-100. KIAA0725 showed no activity against other phospholipids tested.
Overexpression of KIAA0725 altered the distribution of ER-Golgi
proteins. Mutation analysis revealed that catalytic ser351 was required
for lipase activity and for some, but not all, effects of KIAA0725
expression on ER-Golgi protein disorganization.

Using small interfering RNAs, Sato et al. (2010) showed that knockdown
of KIAA0725 in HeLa cells retarded the transport of vesicular stomatitis
virus-encoded glycoprotein (VSVG) from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma
membrane.

Using a lipid overlay and liposome sedimentation assays, Inoue et al.
(2012) showed that recombinant human KIAA0725 bound phosphatidylinositol
3-phosphate, i.e., PI(3)P, PI(4)P, and PI(5)P. Mutation analysis
revealed that the arg434-lys435-lys436 motif within its SAM domain, but
not its catalytic ser351, was required for binding of KIAA0725 to
phospholipids, and for KIAA0725 Golgi/ERGIC membrane association.
KIAA0725 formed oligomers via several interaction sites, including the
DDHD domain, which was also required for phospholipid binding. Nearly
the entire molecule was required for phospholipase activity.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the DDHD2 gene
to chromosome 8.

Hartz (2012) mapped the DDHD2 gene to chromosome 8p11.23 based on an
alignment of the DDHD2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB018268) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By exome sequencing of 2 unrelated families with a complex form of
autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia (SPG54; 615033),
Schuurs-Hoeijmakers et al. (2012) identified biallelic mutations in the
DDHD2 gene (615003.0001-615003.0004). The mutations segregated with the
phenotype in both families. Affected individuals from a large Omani
family with a similar disorder, originally reported as family A by
Al-Yahyaee et al. (2006), were found to be homozygous for another
mutation (615003.0005). An unrelated Iranian patient was homozygous for
yet another DDHD2 mutation (615003.0006). Five of the 6 mutations were
predicted to introduce a premature termination codon into the mRNA. The
phenotype was characterized by delayed psychomotor development,
intellectual disability, and early-onset spasticity of the lower limbs.
Brain MRI showed a thin corpus callosum and periventricular white matter
lesions, whereas brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed an
abnormal lipid peak. Patient fibroblasts did not show any gross
abnormalities in lipid metabolism or organelle morphology. Knockdown of
the Drosophila Ddhd ortholog in 2 cell lines did not change the overall
synaptic terminals in the neuromuscular junction, although 1 cell line
showed smaller synaptic terminals. Knockdown in all 3 cell lines caused
a decrease in active-zone number per synaptic terminal; the active zones
represent the presynaptic sites of neurotransmitter release. However,
mutant flies showed no obvious motor abnormalities. Overall, the
findings suggested that DDHD2 may play a role in synaptic organization
and plasticity.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001

DDHD2, 1-BP INS, 1804T

In 2 sibs of Dutch Filipino descent with autosomal recessive spastic
paraplegia-54 (SPG54; 615033), Schuurs-Hoeijmakers et al. (2012)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the DDHD2 gene: a
1-bp insertion (1804insT), resulting in a frameshift and premature
termination (Thr602IlefsTer18), and a 1-bp deletion (2057delA;
615003.0002), resulting in a frameshift and premature termination
(Glu686GlyfsTer35). RT-PCR analysis suggested that 1 of the alleles,
probably 1804delT, resulted in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The
mutations were found by exome sequencing and confirmed by Sanger
sequencing. Each unaffected parent was heterozygous for 1 of the
mutations, which were not found in several large exome databases.

gene: a 1-bp duplication (138dupC), resulting in a frameshift and
premature termination (Ile463HisfsTer6), and a 1978G-C transversion,
resulting in an asp660-to-his (D660H; 615003.0004) substitution at a
conserved residue in the RIDYXL motif. The mutations were found by exome
sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The 1-bp duplication was
not found in several large exome databases. The D660H mutation was found
in 1 of 13,006 control alleles, but not in a local SNP database of 2,302
alleles. Each unaffected parent was heterozygous for 1 of the mutations.

resulted in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.

300572	TITLE *300572 G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR 64; GPR64
;;G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR, EPIDIDYMIS-SPECIFIC;;
HUMAN EPIDIDYMIS-SPECIFIC PROTEIN 6; HE6
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Osterhoff et al. (1997) used differential screening to identify HE6, a
novel abundant transcript of the human epididymis. The cDNA encodes a
1,014-amino acid polypeptide. The predicted protein contains 7
transmembrane-spanning domains typical of G protein-coupled receptors
and has an extended extracellular N terminus with similarity to highly
glycosylated cell surface molecules such as mucin. By Northern blot
analysis, the HE6 transcript was abundant in the epididymis, but not
found in any other tissue examined. In situ hybridization localized the
transcript to the epithelial cells lining the epididymal duct. Southern
blot analysis showed that HE6 is a single-copy gene.

Obermann et al. (2003) cloned 8 GPR64 variants from a human epididymis
cDNA library that result from alternative splicing of at least 6
mini-exons downstream from the highly conserved sequence encoding the
signal peptide. The longest deduced protein contains 1,017 amino acids.
GPR64 contains a signal peptide, followed by the variable region, a
region with 11 conserved cysteines, a mucin-like
serine/threonine/proline-rich sequence, and a C-terminal 7-transmembrane
domain. A proteolysis site after amino acid 606 creates a hydrophilic
N-terminal ectosubunit and a hydrophobic endosubunit. Western blot
analysis revealed abundant expression of a 180-kD ectosubunit and a
40-kD endosubunit in human and rodent epididymis. Deglycosylation of the
ectosubunit resulted in a 70-kD protein, indicating that it is highly
glycosylated. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that GPR64 was
associated with apical membranes of efferent ductule and proximal
epididymal duct epithelia. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that
Gpr64 expression was restricted to the proximal epididymis in mouse.

MAPPING

By FISH, Obermann et al. (2003) mapped the GPR64 gene to chromosome
Xp21.3. They mapped the mouse Gpr64 gene to a syntenic region on
chromosome X.

ANIMAL MODEL

By targeted deletion of the 7-transmembrane domain of mouse He6, Davies
et al. (2004) created hemizygous He6-knockout male mice. Mutant males
showed reduced fertility compared with wildtype littermates, and
fertility declined with age, resulting in almost complete infertility by
15 weeks of age. Infertility was caused by a defect in luminal fluid
reabsorption, resulting in a buildup of fluid within the testis and an
accumulation of spermatozoa within the efferent ducts.

300110	TITLE *300110 CALCIUM CHANNEL, VOLTAGE-DEPENDENT, ALPHA-1F SUBUNIT; CACNA1F
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The human Xp11.23-p11.22 interval is involved in several hereditary
diseases. Fisher et al. (1997) noted that in constructing YAC contigs
spanning this region, it was found that the region of Xp surrounding the
synaptophysin gene (SYP; 313475) was refractory to cloning in YACs, but
highly stable in cosmids. Preliminary analysis of the cosmid suggested a
high density of coding sequences and prompted complete sequencing of an
SYP-containing cosmid. Fisher et al. (1997) identified 29 putative exons
organized into 3 genes, in addition to the 7 exons of the complete SYP
coding region, all mapping within a 44-kb interval. Two genes were
novel: one (CACNA1F) shows high homology to alpha-1 subunits of calcium
channels (see CACNA2; 114204), whereas the other (LMO6; 300111) encodes
a product with significant similarity to LIM-domain proteins. RT-PCR and
Northern blot studies confirmed that these loci were indeed transcribed.
The third locus (A4; 300112) had been previously described but not
localized to a specific chromosomal site. The region has an elevated GC
content (more than 53%), and Fisher et al. (1997) identified CpG islands
associated with the 5-prime ends of SYP, A4, and LMO6.

Naylor et al. (2000) cloned the mouse Cacna1f gene. The deduced
1,985-amino acid channel protein shares 90% identity with the
1,977-amino acid human protein, with almost perfect conservation between
the functional domains and only a single amino acid substitution within
the transmembrane segments. RT-PCR of several mouse tissues detected
Cacna1f expression only in eye. In situ hybridization detected Cacna1f
in the outer nuclear layer, the inner nuclear layer, and the ganglion
cell layer of mouse retina.

GENE FUNCTION

To study the electrophysiologic and pharmacologic properties of the
L-type calcium channel CACNA1F, Baumann et al. (2004) cloned and
functionally expressed the complete Cacna1f cDNA from the mouse retina.
The data indicated that CACNA1F constitutes the major molecular
correlate of the retinal L-type calcium current. Its intrinsic
biophysical properties, in particular its unique inactivation
properties, enable it to provide a sustained calcium current over the
voltage range required for tonic glutamate release at the photoreceptor
synapse.

Liu et al. (2010) combined electrophysiology to characterize channel
regulation with optical fluorescence resonance energy transfer sensor
determination of free-apocalmodulin (CALM1; 114180) concentration in
live cells. This approach translates quantitative calmodulin
biochemistry from the traditional test-tube context into the realm of
functioning holochannels within intact cells. From this perspective, Liu
et al. (2010) found that long splice forms of Ca(V)1.3 (CACNA1D; 114206)
and Ca(V)1.4 (CACNA1F) channels include a distal carboxy tail that
resembles an enzyme competitive inhibitor that retunes channel affinity
for apocalmodulin such that natural calmodulin variations affect the
strength of Ca(2+) feedback modulation. Given the ubiquity of these
channels, the connection between ambient calmodulin levels and Ca(2+)
entry through channels is broadly significant for Ca(2+) homeostasis.

MAPPING

Fisher et al. (1997) determined that the order of loci in the
Xp11.23-p11.22 interval is Xpter-A4-LMO6-SYP-CACNA1F-Xcen, with
intergenic distances ranging from approximately 300 bp to approximately
5 kb. The density of transcribed sequences in this area (more than 80%)
is comparable to that found in the highly gene-rich band Xq28.

Naylor et al. (2000) mapped the mouse Cacna1f gene to a region of the X
chromosome that shows homology of synteny to human chromosome Xp11.23.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Incomplete Congenital Stationary Night Blindness, Type 2A

Conducting mutation analysis in 13 families with the incomplete form of
X-linked congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB2A; 300071), Strom
et al. (1998) identified 9 different mutations in 10 families, including
3 nonsense and 1 frameshift mutation. Similarly, by mutation analysis of
the CACNA1F gene in 20 families with incomplete CSNB, Bech-Hansen et al.
(1998) found 6 different mutations, all of which predicted premature
protein truncation.

Boycott et al. (2001) summarized 20 CACNA1F mutations that had been
identified in 36 families with incomplete X-linked congenital stationary
night blindness. Three of the mutations accounted for incomplete CSNB in
2 or more families, and a founder effect was demonstrable for one of
these mutations. Of the 20 mutations identified, 14 (70%) were predicted
to cause premature protein truncation and 6 (30%) to cause amino acid
substitutions or deletions at conserved positions in the alpha-1F
protein.

Wutz et al. (2002) reported comprehensive mutation analysis of the 48
exons of the CACNA1F gene in 34 unrelated cases (33 families and 1
sporadic case) diagnosed with the incomplete form of X-linked congenital
stationary night blindness, based on ERG data and dark adaptation tests.
Ten of the families had been partially characterized previously (Strom
et al., 1998). The patients were of German (32), Belgian (1), and French
(1) origin. Mutation analysis was also performed in 2 patients with an
Aland Island disease (300600)-related phenotype. A total of 30 different
mutations (20 of which were novel) were identified in 33 patients, 31
CSNB2 familial cases, and the 2 patients with an AIED-like phenotype.
Reevaluation of the AIED-like phenotype indicated full compatibility of
the patients' ophthalmologic findings with CSNB2. The mutations were
equally distributed over the entire gene sequence and included 13
missense, 8 nonsense, 5 splice site, 3 deletion, and 1 insertion
mutations. RT-PCR experiments in mouse strains with photoreceptor
degeneration showed that the Cacna1f gene is not exclusively expressed
in photoreceptors but in the outer nuclear, the inner nuclear, and the
ganglion cell layer as well.

Nakamura et al. (2003) described 2 Japanese brothers with retinal and
optic disc atrophy and progressive decrease of visual function with
increasing age. Although these clinical features are atypical of
patients with incomplete CSNB, both patients had an in-frame mutation
with deletion and insertion in exon 4 of the CACNA1F gene. In both
patients, the bright flash, mixed rod-cone ERG had a negative
configuration, characteristic of incomplete CSNB. However, the
full-field scotopic and photopic ERGs were nonrecordable, indicating
severe, diffuse retinal malfunction, not typical of incomplete CSNB.
These findings underscored the phenotypic variability of incomplete
CSNB.

Hemara-Wahanui et al. (2005) identified an ile745-to-thr mutation
(I745T; 300110.0006) in the CACNA1F gene in a New Zealand family with a
visual disorder more severe than typical CSNB2.

- Cone-Rod Dystrophy 3

In a large Finnish family with X-linked cone-rod dystrophy-3 (CORDX3;
300476), previously reported by Jalkanen et al. (2003), Jalkanen et al.
(2006) identified a splice site mutation in the CACNA1F gene
(300110.0007).

- Aland Island Eye Disease

In affected members of the original family with Aland Island eye disease
(300600) described by Forsius and Eriksson (1964), Jalkanen et al.
(2007) identified homozygosity for a 425-bp deletion mutation
encompassing exon 30 and portions of adjacent introns of the CACN1F gene
(300110.0008). The mutation was found in heterozygous state in carrier
females of this family and was not found in samples from 121 Finnish
male control subjects.

ANIMAL MODEL

Mansergh et al. (2005) generated a mouse with a loss-of-function
mutation in exon 7 of the mouse Cacna1f gene. Electroretinography of the
mutant mouse revealed a scotopic a-wave of marginally reduced amplitude
compared with the wildtype mouse and absence of the postreceptoral
b-wave and oscillatory potentials. Cone ERG responses together with
visual evoked potentials and multi-unit activity in the superior
colliculus were also absent. Calcium imaging of retinal slices
depolarized with KCl showed 90% less peak signal in the photoreceptor
synapses of the Cacna1f mutant than in wildtype mice. The absence of
postreceptoral ERG responses and the diminished photoreceptor calcium
signals were consistent with a loss of Ca(2+) channel function in
photoreceptors. Immunocytochemistry showed no detectable Cav1.4 protein
in the outer plexiform layer of Cacna1f-mutant mice, profound loss of
photoreceptor synapses, and abnormal dendritic sprouting of second-order
neurons in the photoreceptor layer. Mansergh et al. (2005) concluded
that the Cav1.4 calcium channel is vital for the functional assembly
and/or maintenance and synaptic functions of photoreceptor ribbon
synapses.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
NIGHT BLINDNESS, CONGENITAL STATIONARY, TYPE 2A
CACNA1F, GLY369ASP

One of the missense mutations identified by Strom et al. (1998) in cases
of incomplete X-linked congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB2A;
300071) was a gly369-to-asp (G369D) amino acid substitution resulting
from a transition of nucleotide 1106 in exon 8.

.0002
NIGHT BLINDNESS, CONGENITAL STATIONARY, TYPE 2A
CACNA1F, ARG958TER

One of the nonsense mutations identified in families with incomplete
X-linked congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB2A; 300071) by Strom
et al. (1998) was an arg958-to-ter (R958X) mutation due to a C-to-T
transition of nucleotide 2172 in exon 24.

.0003
NIGHT BLINDNESS, CONGENITAL STATIONARY, TYPE 2A
CACNA1F, 1-BP INS, 991C

In 15 CSNB2A (300071) families with the common Mennonite haplotype,
suggesting that these families share a founder mutation (Boycott et al.
(1998)), Bech-Hansen et al. (1998) found insertion of a single C
nucleotide at codon 991 for leucine (L991insC). The insertion caused a
frameshift with stop codon 1001.

.0004
NIGHT BLINDNESS, CONGENITAL STATIONARY, TYPE 2A
CACNA1F, ARG830TER

Among families with CSNB2A (300071), one of the truncating mutations
found by Bech-Hansen et al. (1998) was a C-to-T transition in exon 21 of
the CACNA1F gene, resulting in an arg830-to-ter (R830X) nonsense amino
acid change.

.0005
NIGHT BLINDNESS, CONGENITAL STATIONARY, TYPE 2A
CACNA1F, 1-BP DEL, 4548C

In 2 affected members of a French family segregating X-linked congenital
stationary night blindness type 2, Jacobi et al. (2003) identified a
1-bp deletion (C) at nucleotide 4548 in the CACNA1F gene, resulting in a
frameshift with a predicted premature termination at codon 1524.

.0006
NIGHT BLINDNESS, CONGENITAL STATIONARY, TYPE 2A, SEVERE
CACNA1F, ILE745THR

Hemara-Wahanui et al. (2005) identified a C-to-T transition at
nucleotide 2234 in exon 17 of the CACNA1F gene in a New Zealand family
with a retinal disorder similar to, but more severe than, X-linked
congenital stationary night blindness-2 (CSNB2A; 300071). The transition
resulted in the substitution of a conserved isoleucine with threonine at
residue 745 (I745T) within transmembrane segment IIS6. Affected males
had congenital nystagmus, decreased visual acuity, frequent
hypermetropia, and normal fundi. Female family members had congenital
nystagmus, decreased visual acuity, and frequent high myopia, in
contrast to typical CSNB2A families, in which female heterozygotes are
unaffected. Electroretinography showed CSNB2A-like features in males and
similar, but less severe, features in females. In addition, some
visually impaired males had intellectual impairment and were autistic.
Hemara-Wahanui et al. (2005) found that the I745T mutation caused
altered channel activity following expression in human embryonic kidney
cells. The channel showed a dramatic shift of about -30 mV in the
voltage dependence of activation and significantly slower inactivation
kinetics. Hemara-Wahanui et al. (2005) concluded that the I745T mutation
increases the number of mutant channels open at physiologic membrane
potential and allows for persistent Ca(2+) entry due to reduced channel
inactivation, resulting in a gain-of-function defect.

.0007
CONE-ROD DYSTROPHY, X-LINKED, 3
CACNA1F, 5-BP DEL/3-BP INS

In a large Finnish family with X-linked cone-rod dystrophy-3 (CORDX3;
300476), previously reported by Jalkanen et al. (2003), Jalkanen et al.
(2006) identified a deletion/insertion (IVS28-1 GCGTC-TGG) at -1
position in the splice acceptor site of intron 28 of the CACNA1F gene.
The mutation cosegregated completely with the disease phenotype in the
family, which included 7 affected males, 10 carrier females, and 33
unaffected family members; it was not found in 200 control chromosomes.
RNA studies revealed that the mutation caused altered splicing of the
CACNA1F transcript, resulting in 5 variants with predicted premature
termination and exonic deletions of the encoded protein.

.0008
ALAND ISLAND EYE DISEASE
CACNA1F, 425-BP DEL

In affected members of the original family with Aland Island eye disease
(300600) described by Forsius and Eriksson (1964), Jalkanen et al.
(2007) identified homozygosity for a 425-bp deletion mutation
encompassing exon 30 and portions of adjacent introns of the CACN1F
gene. The mutation was found in heterozygous state in carrier females of
this family and was not found in samples from 121 Finnish male control
subjects. The mutation is predicted to cause a deletion of the
transmembrane domain IVS2 and the preceding extracellular loop and
consequently an altered membrane topology for the C-terminal part of the
protein.

;;SLP2;;
PARAPROTEIN TARGET 7; PARATARG7;;
PARATARG 7
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to stomatin (EPB72;
133090), followed by PCR and 5-prime and 3-prime RACE of a heart cDNA
library, Wang and Morrow (2000) cloned STOML2, which they designated
SLP2. The deduced 356-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass
of 38.5 kD. STOML2 has 3 potential initiator sites, all sharing the same
open reading frame. The STOML2 protein contains the cognate stomatin
family consensus sequence, but it lacks the characteristic N-terminal
hydrophobic domain and palmitoylation consensus sequence. STOML2 shares
greatest sequence homology with stomatin and SLP1 in a region predicted
to contain beta-sheet and alpha-helix structures. Northern blot analysis
detected a 1.5-kb STOML2 transcript in all tissues examined, with
highest levels in heart, liver, and pancreas. Western blot analysis
detected STOML2 at apparent molecular masses of 45.5 kD or 44.6 kD in
all human and mammalian cell lines and tissues examined, including red
blood cells. Some cells also showed a faint band at about 34.3 kD, which
may represent translation from an alternate initiation site. STOML2
partitioned into both Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble pools in
erythrocyte ghost membranes or following expression in COS cells.

Owczarek et al. (2001) cloned STOML2 from a fetal brain cDNA library.
They identified several motifs for posttranslational modification,
including multiple phosphorylation sites, 6 potential N-myristoylation
sites, and 2 N-glycosylation sites. Northern blot analysis detected a
1.3-kb STOML2 transcript in all tissues examined, with highest
expression in skeletal muscle and heart.

Da Cruz et al. (2008) showed that SLP2, which contains an N-terminal
mitochondrial targeting sequence, localized to HeLa cell mitochondrial
inner membranes. SDS-PAGE detected SLP2 at an apparent molecular mass of
38 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

By gel filtration, mass spectrometry, coimmunoprecipitation, and Western
blot analysis of HeLa cells, Da Cruz et al. (2008) showed that SLP2
formed dimers and localized to a 250-kD complex containing prohibitin-1
(PHB; 176705) and prohibitin-2 (PHB2; 610704). Knockdown of SLP2 in HeLa
cells or mouse embryonic fibroblasts via RNA interference led to
increased proteolysis of the prohibitins and of subunits of respiratory
chain complexes I and IV, but not II and III. Mitochondrial stress, but
not DNA damage, upregulated SLP2 expression. Da Cruz et al. (2008)
concluded that SLP2 plays a role in regulating stability in a subset of
mitochondrial proteins.

Christie et al. (2011) found that overexpression of SLP2 in human
lymphocytes increased mitochondrial mass and function and increased
synthesis of cardiolipin, a mitochondrial membrane phospholipid.
Deletion analysis revealed that the N-terminal mitochondrial targeting
signal was required for the effects of SLP2 on mitochondrial biogenesis
and function. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis confirmed that SLP2
interacted with PHB1 and PHB2. Overexpression of SLP2 increased the
association of PHB1 with mitochondrial membranes.

Antigenic targets of paraproteins, or paratargs, may play a role in the
pathogenesis of monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (see
153600), Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (see 153600), and multiple
myeloma (254500). Preuss et al. (2011) noted that all autoantigenic
paratargs, including STOML2, which they called paratarg-7, are
hyperphosphorylated in patients compared with healthy controls,
suggesting a general pathogenic mechanism. They showed that
hyperphosphorylation of paratarg-7 occurs due to an additional
phosphorylation of ser17. Using coimmunoprecipitation analysis, Preuss
et al. (2011) identified phosphokinase C (PKC)-zeta (PRKCZ; 176982) as
the kinase responsible for hyperphosphorylation of paratarg-7 and most
other autoantigenic paratargs tested. They identified phosphatase-2A
(PP2A; see 176915) as the phosphatase responsible for dephosphorylation
of all hyperphosphorylated autoantigenic paratargs tested. PKC-zeta
showed no differences between carriers of hyperphosphorylated and
wildtype paratarg-7. However, the catalytic subunit of PP2A (PPP2CA;
176915) was predominantly inactivated by phosphorylation of tyr307 in
carriers of hyperphosphorylated paratarg-7, whereas carriers of wildtype
paratarg-7 predominantly expressed the nonphosphorylated, active form.
Stimulation of T cells from healthy carriers of wildtype paratarg-7
induced a partial and transient hyperphosphorylation of paratarg-7 that
could be maintained by incubation with PP2A inhibitors. Preuss et al.
(2011) concluded that inactivation of the catalytic subunit of PP2A by
tyr307 phosphorylation causes hyperphosphorylation of autoantigenic
paratargs.

GENE STRUCTURE

Owczarek et al. (2001) determined that the STOML2 gene contains 10 exons
and spans 3.25 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis Wang and Morrow (2000) mapped the STOML2
gene to chromosome 9p13. Using radiation hybrid analysis, Owczarek et
al. (2001) mapped the STOML2 gene to chromosome 9p13.1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Preuss et al. (2009) screened a human fetal brain-derived macroarray
with the IgA or IgG paraprotein-containing sera of 192 consecutive
patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS)
or multiple myeloma (see 254500), and found that 29 (15.1%) of the 192
paraproteins reacted with a protein they designated 'paratarg-7,' which
was found to be identical to stomatin-like protein-2. DNA sequence
analysis of STOML2 gene showed no difference between patients with
paratarg-7-reactive paraprotein or patients with paraproteins of other
specificities. Peptide-spot analysis demonstrated that a peptide
spanning amino acids 16 to 35 binds the anti-paratarg-7 paraprotein.

Grass et al. (2009) studied 35 patients with MGUS or multiple myeloma
who had an antiparatarg-7 paraprotein and found that all 35 patients
expressed hyperphosphorylated paratarg-7 (615121), whereas
hyperphosphorylation was not observed in 217 other patients with MGUS or
multiple myeloma whose paraprotein did not bind to paratarg-7.
Paratarg-7 hyperphosphorylation was also found in 4 (2%) of 200 healthy
blood donors, none of whom had monoclonal immunoglobulins in their
serum. Thus, hyperphosphorylation of paratarg-7 appeared to be
associated with a significantly increased risk of developing MGUS or
multiple myeloma (odds ratio, 7.9; p = 0.0001).

314980	TITLE *314980 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN, X-LINKED; ZFX
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Page et al. (1987) identified a Y-encoded zinc finger protein (ZFY;
490000). A similar DNA sequence, ZFX, was identified on the X
chromosome.

Using PCR, Palmer et al. (1990) demonstrated close similarity of ZFY and
ZFX. Both genes were expressed in a wide range of adult and fetal human
tissues, and ZFX was expressed from the inactive X chromosome present in
human-mouse hybrids. Schneider-Gadicke et al. (1989) also showed that
ZFX escapes X inactivation in humans. Adler et al. (1991) showed that in
the mouse, unlike the human, the Zfx gene is subject to X-inactivation.

GENE FUNCTION

In vitro fertilization (IVF), blastomere biopsy of the 6-8 cell embryo,
and single cell DNA diagnosis allow couples at risk of transmitting a
particular genetic disorder to start a pregnancy knowing their child
will not be affected. Chong et al. (1993) developed a PCR strategy for
sex determination at the single cell level by simultaneous amplification
and subsequent restriction fragment analysis of the homologous but
nonallelic ZFX and ZFY genes. They showed that XY cells could be
correctly genotyped as ZFX/ZFY and XX cells as ZFX only.

The human ZFX, human ZFY, and mouse Zfx genes have CpG islands near
their 5-prime ends. These islands are typical in that they span about
1.5 kb, contain transcription initiation sites, and encompass some
5-prime untranslated exons and introns. However, comparative nucleotide
sequencing of these human and mouse islands provided evidence of
evolutionary conservation to a degree unprecedented among mammalian
5-prime CpG islands (Luoh et al., 1995). In one stretch of 165
nucleotides containing 19 CpGs, mouse Zfx and human ZFX are identical to
each other and differ from human ZFY at only 9 nucleotides. In contrast,
Luoh et al. (1995) found no evidence of homologous CpG islands in the
mouse Zfy genes, whose transcription is more circumscribed than that of
human ZFX, human ZFY, and mouse Zfx. Using the isoschizomers HpaII and
MspI to examine a highly conserved segment of the ZFX CpG island, Luoh
et al. (1995) detected methylation on inactive mouse X chromosomes but
not on inactive human X chromosomes. These observations paralleled the
previous findings that mouse Zfx undergoes X inactivation while human
Zfx escapes it.

MAPPING

Muller and Schempp (1989) assigned the ZFX locus to Xp21.3 by in situ
hybridization; the ZFY gene was assigned to Yp11.32. Page et al. (1990)
concluded, from meiotic linkage analysis and physical mapping, that ZFX
is distal to POLA (312040), near the boundary of bands Xp21.3 and
Xp22.1.

Sinclair et al. (1988) showed that in marsupials sequences homologous to
ZFY and ZFX map not to the X and Y but to autosomes. This implies that
ZFY is not the primary sex-determining gene in marsupials. Either the
genetic pathways of sex determination in marsupials and eutherians
differ, or they are identical and ZFY is not the primary signal in human
sex determination.

CYTOGENETICS

Scherer et al. (1989) described two 46,XY females with tandem
duplications of an Xp segment resulting in a double dose of ZFX on the 1
active X chromosome. The duplicated segment in each case included the
Xp22.2-p21.2 interval. The duplication was apparently responsible for
sex inversion and favored the model of sex determination as an
antagonistic interaction between ZFY and ZFX genes. Because of other
abnormalities, 1 of the children died at age 2 years and the other was
severely ill at age 7 months. In the second case internal genitalia was
said to have been normal, but gonadotropin stimulation showed primary
hypogonadism. Thus the cases do not help in resolution of the question
of whether the XY female type of gonadal dysgenesis is due to mutation
in the same locus.

ANIMAL MODEL

Galan-Caridad et al. (2007) used conditional gene targeting to examine
the role of Zfx in mouse embryonic and adult hematopoietic stem cells.
Zfx was required for self-renewal of both stem cell types, but it was
dispensable for growth and differentiation of their progeny.
Galan-Caridad et al. (2007) concluded that ZFX is a shared
transcriptional regulator of embryonic and adult stem cells, indicating
a common molecular basis for stem cell self-renewal.

605521	TITLE *605521 TATA BOX-BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE PROTEIN 1; TBPL1
;;TBP-LIKE PROTEIN 1;;
TLP;;
TBP-RELATED FACTOR 2; TRF2;;
TBP-LIKE FACTOR; TLF
DESCRIPTION TBP-related factor 2 (TRF2) is a general transcription factor essential
for spermiogenesis.

CLONING

General transcription factors (GTFs), including TATA box-binding protein
(TBP; 600075), are necessary for the initiation of transcription of
eukaryotic genes. By searching EST databases for genes resembling TBP,
Ohbayashi et al. (1999) identified a cDNA encoding TBPL1, which they
termed TLP. Sequence analysis predicted that the 186-amino acid protein
is 100% identical to the mouse sequence (Ohbayashi et al., 1999) and 76%
similar to the CCD region of TBP. Northern blot analysis revealed
ubiquitous expression of a 1.5-kb transcript. Western blot analysis
detected TBLP1 as a 24-kD protein. Gel shift analysis determined that
TBPL1, unlike the Drosophila neural gene-specific GTF Trf1, does not
bind the TATA box.

Using methods similar to those of Ohbayashi et al. (1999), Rabenstein et
al. (1999) cloned TBPL1, which they called TRF2. They noted that TBPL1
has a conserved bipartite repeat core. Western blot analysis showed that
TBPL1 interacts with both GTF2A (see GTF2A1; 600520) and GTF2B (189963)
but not with TATA box elements. Northern blot analysis detected highest
expression of TBPL1 in testis, in which an abundant larger alternative
transcript was also found. Rabenstein et al. (1999) noted that
Drosophila Trf1 and Trf2 appear to target different sets of genes.

Using FISH, Ohbayashi et al. (1999) mapped the TBPL1 gene to
6q22.1-q22.3.

GENE FUNCTION

Veenstra et al. (2000) tested the role of Tbp during the onset of
embryonic transcription in Xenopus by antisense oligonucleotide-mediated
turnover of maternal Tbp mRNA. Embryos without detectable Tbp initiated
gastrulation but died before completing gastrulation. The expression of
many genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II and III was reduced;
however, some genes were transcribed with an efficiency identical to
that of Tbp-containing embryos. Using a similar antisense strategy,
Veenstra et al. (2000) found that Tlf/Trf2 was essential for development
past the midblastula stage. Because TBP and a TLF factor were found to
play complementary roles in embryonic development, Veenstra et al.
(2000) concluded that although similar mechanistic roles exist in
common, TBP and TLF function differentially to control transcription of
specific genes.

ANIMAL MODEL

Martianov et al. (2001) inactivated the murine Tlf gene using homologous
recombination. Tlf -/- mice were viable, but mutant male mice were
sterile due to a late, complete arrest of spermiogenesis. In mutant
animals, spermatogonia and spermatocytes developed normally, but round
spermatids underwent apoptosis at step 7. Although the expression of the
transcriptional activator Crem (123812) and many other postmeiotic genes
was unaltered in Tlf null mice, several spermiogenesis genes transcribed
in late round spermatids appeared to be under Tlf control. Hence, Tlf is
not required for embryonic development in the mouse but is essential for
spermiogenesis.

In contrast to observations of an embryonic lethal phenotype for TRF2
inactivation in Caenorhabditis elegans and Xenopus laevis, Zhang et al.
(2001) found that Trf2-deficient mice are viable. However, Trf2 -/- mice
are sterile because of a severe defect in spermiogenesis. Postmeiotic
round spermatids advanced at most to step 7 of differentiation but
failed to progress to the elongated form, and gene-specific
transcription deficiencies were identified. Zhang et al. (2001)
speculated that mammals may have evolved more specialized TRF2 functions
in the testis that involve transcriptional regulation of genes essential
for spermiogenesis.

146631	TITLE *146631 INTERCELLULAR ADHESION MOLECULE 3; ICAM3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Fawcett et al. (1992) cloned a third ligand for LFA1 (153370; 600065);
also see intercellular adhesion molecules 1 and 2 (ICAM1, 147840; ICAM2,
146630). ICAM1 and ICAM2 are members of the immunoglobulin superfamily.
The interaction of LFA1 with ICAM provides essential accessory adhesion
signals in many immune interactions, including those between T and B
lymphocytes and cytotoxic T cells and their targets. Both ICAMs are
expressed at low levels on resting vascular endothelium; ICAM1 is
strongly upregulated by cytokine stimulation and plays a key role in the
arrest of leukocytes in blood vessels at sites of inflammation and
injury. Resting leukocytes were shown to express a third ligand, ICAM3,
for LFA1. ICAM3 is potentially the most important ligand for LFA1 in the
initiation of the immune response because the expression of ICAM1 on
resting leukocytes is low. Fawcett et al. (1992) used expression cloning
to isolate a cDNA encoding a protein which is constitutively expressed
on all leukocytes and which binds LFA1. ICAM3 is closely related to
ICAM1, consists of 5 immunoglobulin domains, and binds LFA1 through its
2 N-terminal domains. Vazeux et al. (1992) cloned the same intercellular
adhesion molecule, which they referred to as ICAM-R. The cDNA was 1,781
bp long, with a 1,640-bp open reading frame starting with an ATG at
position 16, followed by a second ATG at position 24. Overall identities
in protein structure with ICAM1 and ICAM2 were 48% and 31%,
respectively, with the degree of similarity varying between individual

Using the cDNA as a probe, Bossy et al. (1994) mapped the ICAM3 gene to
19p13.3-p13.2 by isotopic in situ hybridization. They also mapped the
gene to chromosome 19 by PCR amplification of DNAs from somatic cell
hybrids. ICAM1 maps to the same region of chromosome 19.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Novick et al. (1994) described a universal ligand-binding receptor for
human interferons alpha and interferon beta. Sarkar and Gupta (1984)
showed that gamma-interferon binds to a separate receptor that is
carried by WISH cells (a human amnion cell line). The gene for the
receptor was designated also IFNAR.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lutfalla et al. (1992) detected 11 exons in the IFNAR gene.

MAPPING

Alpha-type antiviral protein is a factor that mediates specific
interferon inhibition of virus replication. According to studies of
mouse-man hybrid clones, the locus determining this protein is carried
on chromosome 21 (Tan et al., 1973). Tan et al. (1974) made observations
of dosage effect in monosomy-21 and trisomy-21 cells, which supported
assignment of the locus to chromosome 21. This character was also called
interferon sensitivity (IS). Chany et al. (1975) showed that trisomy-21
cells have increased interferon sensitivity. Trisomy-16 cells have
reduced sensitivity. This might suggest the presence on chromosome 16 of
a regulator of mouse antiviral protein.

In trisomy-21 fibroblasts, Epstein and Epstein (1976) demonstrated an
exaggerated response to both classic (virus-induced) and immune
(phytohemagglutinin-induced) forms of interferon. This suggested that
despite their physical and antigenic differences the antiviral
expression of the 2 interferons is mediated by the same genetic locus. A
line trisomic for the distal part of the long arm 21q21-qter also
demonstrated increased response, indicating that the AVP gene is located
on this part of chromosome 21. Lin et al. (1980) demonstrated that the
genes for soluble SOD (147450) and interferon sensitivity are syntenic
in the mouse and on chromosome 16.

Raziuddin et al. (1984) showed that the receptors for alpha- and
beta-interferons are specified by chromosome 21. It was presumed that
separate genes encoded the alpha- and beta-interferon receptors.

Langer et al. (1990) sublocalized the IFNAR gene to 21q22.1-q22.2 by
hybridization of (32)P-labeled recombinant interferon-alpha/beta
receptor with human-hamster somatic cell hybrids containing various
fragments of human chromosome 21. By in situ hybridization, Lutfalla et
al. (1990) refined the assignment to 21q22.1. Lutfalla et al. (1992)
further refined the localization by pulsed field gel electrophoresis and
its linkage to adjacent markers. They compared the exon structure of the
IFNAR gene with that of the genes for receptors of the cytokine/growth
hormone/prolactin/interferon receptor family and concluded that they
have a common origin and have diverged from the immunoglobulin
superfamily with which they share a common ancestor.

GENE FUNCTION

Revel et al. (1976) showed that antibody to a cell surface component
coded by human chromosome 21 inhibited the action of interferon. This
suggested that antiviral protein is an interferon receptor. See 147570,
147640, 147660 for a discussion of the gamma, beta, and alpha
interferons, respectively. De Clercq et al. (1976) concluded that it is
not a cell membrane receptor for interferon that is encoded by
chromosome 21.

Cellular responses to cytokines involve cross-communication through
their respective receptors (summary by Takaoka et al., 2000). The IFNs
alpha, beta, and gamma mediate innate immune responses to viral
infection through IFNAR1/IFNAR2 (602376) for IFNA and IFNB, and IFNGR1
(107470)/IFNGR2 (147569) for IFNG. Stimulation of these receptors
activates Janus protein kinases (e.g., JAK1, 147795 and JAK2, 147796),
which leads to the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 (600555) and STAT2
(600556). Although the IFN receptors are expressed at low levels in
cells, they may be clustered in the cell membrane to permit efficient
signal transduction.

Using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from IFNAR1- and
IFNGR1-deficient mice, Takaoka et al. (2000) observed that the
STAT1-mediated DNA-binding activity and the antiviral response to IFNG
in IFNAR-null MEFs but not to IFNA in IFNGR-null MEFs are impaired.
Restoration of the IFNG response requires constitutive subthreshold
IFNA/IFNB signaling and an intact IFNAR1 capable of interacting with
STAT1 after tyrosine phosphorylation. Immunoblot analysis showed that
IFNAR1 coimmunoprecipitated with the nonligand-binding component,
IFNGR2, of the IFNGR complex in wildtype MEFs but less well in IFNB-null
MEFs. Immunoblot analysis also demonstrated that the IFN receptor
components are exclusively localized in the caveolar membrane fractions
(see CAV1; 601047) where there is a concentration of cytoplasmically
oriented signaling molecules.

In the type I interferon receptor, TYK2 (176941) associates with the
IFNAR1 receptor subunit and positively influences ligand binding to the
receptor complex. Ragimbeau et al. (2003) found that TYK2 was required
for stable cell surface expression of IFNAR1 in human fibrosarcoma
cells. In the absence of TYK2, IFNAR1 was exported to the plasma
membrane but then accumulated in endocytic organelles. TYK2 coexpression
prevented intracellular accumulation of IFNAR1 by restraining its
constitutive internalization, and thus stabilized it at the cell
surface.

Essers et al. (2009) showed that in response to treatment of mice with
Ifn-alpha, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) efficiently exit G0 and enter
an active cell cycle. HSCs respond to Ifn-alpha treatment by the
increased phosphorylation of Stat1 (600555) and Akt1 (164730), the
expression of Ifn-alpha target genes, and the upregulation of stem cell
antigen-1 (Sca1, also known as Ly6a, present only in mouse). HSCs
lacking the Ifn-alpha/beta receptor (Ifnar), Stat1, or Sca1 are
insensitive to Ifn-alpha stimulation, demonstrating that Stat1 and Sca1
mediate Ifn-alpha-induced HSC proliferation. Although dormant HSCs are
resistant to the antiproliferative chemotherapeutic agent
5-fluoro-uracil, HSCs pretreated (primed) with Ifn-alpha and thus
induced to proliferate are efficiently eliminated by 5-fluoro-uracil
exposure in vivo. Conversely, HSCs chronically activated by Ifn-alpha
are functionally compromised and are rapidly outcompeted by
nonactivatable Ifnar-null cells in competitive repopulation assays.
Whereas chronic activation of the Ifn-alpha pathway in HSCs impairs
their function, acute Ifn-alpha treatment promotes the proliferation of
dormant HSCs in vivo.

ANIMAL MODEL

Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) induces a cytosolic signaling cascade that
results in expression of IFNB, a cytokine critical in viral defense.
Auerbuch et al. (2004) found that Ifnar1-deficient mice were much more
resistant to Lm infection than wildtype mice, suggesting that induction
of Ifnb during Lm intracytosolic growth leads to enhanced bacterial
survival. Resistance to Lm infection in Ifnar1-deficient mice was
associated with an increase in the number of Cd11b (ITGAM;
120980)-positive cells producing Tnf (191160). Auerbuch et al. (2004)
proposed that intracytosolic Lm induces Ifnb expression, thereby
suppressing Tnf-producing phagocytic cells at sites of bacterial growth.

613438	TITLE *613438 FCH DOMAIN ONLY PROTEIN 2; FCHO2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases for genes encoding a FES (190030)-CIP4 (TRIP10;
604504) homology (FCH) domain, Katoh and Katoh (2004) identified FCHO2.
The deduced 810-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal FCH domain and
an evolutionarily conserved C-terminal FCHO homology (FOH) domain. FCHO2
shares 94.6% identity with mouse Fcho2 and 50.4% identity with human
FCHO1 (613437).

GENE FUNCTION

Henne et al. (2010) reported that the membrane-sculpting F-BAR
domain-containing Fer/Cip4 homology domain-only proteins 1 and 2
(FCHO1/2) are required for plasma membrane clathrin-coated vesicle (CCV)
budding and marked sites of CCV formation. Changes in FCHO1/2 expression
levels correlated directly with numbers of CCV budding events, ligand
endocytosis, and synaptic vesicle marker recycling. FCHO1/2 proteins
bound specifically to the plasma membrane and recruited the scaffold
proteins eps15 (600051) and intersectin (602442), which in turn engaged
the adaptor complex AP2 (see 601024). The FCHO F-BAR membrane-bending
activity was required, leading to the proposal that FCHO1/2 sculpt the
initial bud site and recruit the clathrin machinery for CCV formation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Katoh and Katoh (2004) determined that the FCHO2 gene contains at least
26 exons and spans 134.4 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Katoh and Katoh (2004) mapped the FCHO2
gene to chromosome 5q13.2.

607035	TITLE *607035 SUPPRESSOR OF FUSED, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF; SUFU
;;SUFUH
SUFUXL, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SUFU encodes a component of the Sonic hedgehog (SHH; 600725)/Patched
(PTCH; 601309) signaling pathway. Mutations in genes encoding components
of this pathway are deleterious for normal development and are
associated with cancer-predisposing syndromes (e.g., HPE3, 142945; BCNS,
109400; and GCPS, 175700).

CLONING

By EST database searching for homologs of Drosophila suppressor of fused
(Sufu), followed by RACE, Kogerman et al. (1999) obtained a cDNA
encoding human SUFU. The deduced 484-amino acid protein is 40% identical
to the fly protein. Northern blot analysis detected ubiquitous
expression of a minor 2.8-kb and a major 5.5-kb transcript. Whole-mount
in situ hybridization analysis detected expression throughout
midgestation in the neural tube and, later, in the neural tube's brain
and spinal cord derivatives, overlapping with expression of Ptch and
Gli1 (165220), Gli2 (165230), and Gli3 (165240). Similar analysis in a
12-week human embryo showed marked expression in perichondrial
osteoblasts, cells that also receive a hedgehog signal.

Stone et al. (1999) independently cloned and characterized SUFU and
identified shorter splice variants, truncated by 52 and 3 amino acids.
The full-length protein, which is 97% identical to the mouse protein,
contains a PEST sequence and multiple potential phosphorylation sites.
In addition to the same transcripts identified by Kogerman et al.
(1999), they detected smaller 2.0- and 1.0-kb transcripts in testis. By
semiquantitative PCR, they determined that the full-length isoform is
more abundant in all tissues.

Grimm et al. (2001) identified a low abundance isoform, SUFU-XL, of 485
amino acids as well as shorter isoforms restricted to leukocytes and
testis. They detected expression of normal SUFU and SUFU-XL in a panel
of tumor cDNA libraries. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that
neither of the shorter isoforms is able to bind GLI1.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Grimm et al. (2001) determined that the
mouse and human SUFU genes contain 12 exons.

MAPPING

By FISH, Stone et al. (1999) mapped the SUFU gene to chromosome
10q24-q25. Grimm et al. (2001) confirmed the localization by radiation
hybrid analysis. By FISH, Taylor et al. (2002) mapped the SUFU gene to
10q24.3 distal to the PTEN gene (601728), which maps to 10q23.31 and is
approximately 1 Mb telomeric to BTRC.

GENE FUNCTION

By luciferase reporter analysis, Kogerman et al. (1999) showed that SUFU
inhibits the transcriptional activity of GLI1 and osteogenic
differentiation in response to SHH signaling. Immunoprecipitation
analysis determined that SUFU and GLI1 are associated in an
intracellular complex. Confocal microscopy demonstrated both cytoplasmic
and nuclear expression of SUFU; however, colocalization with GLI1, due
to a central leucine-rich CRM1 (XPO1; 602559)-dependent nuclear-export
signal, was restricted to cytoplasm. Inhibition of CRM1 resulted in
nuclear expression of GLI1 in the absence of full-length SUFU that has
an intact C terminus necessary for GLI1-induced transcriptional
activation. Truncated GLI1 bound to DNA also interacted with SUFU.

By GST pull-down and yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Stone et al. (1999)
demonstrated that SUFU interacts with GLI2 and GLI3 through its extreme
C-terminal end, as well as with GLI1 and SLIMB (BTRC; 603482). Reporter
analysis indicated that BTRC containing an F-box domain potentiates the
inhibitory effect of SUFU on GLI activity. Stone et al. (1999) concluded
that SUFU is a direct negative regulator of GLI and that this regulation
may occur at multiple levels, possibly depending on the relative
intracellular concentrations of different signaling components.

In Drosophila, Cos2 is a major inhibitor of Shh signaling, and Sufu is a
minor inhibitor. Varjosalo et al. (2006) found the opposite was true in
mouse cells; RNA interference studies indicated Sufu was a major Shh
repressor and the mammalian orthologs of Cos2, Kif7 and Kif27, had no
effect.

Lee et al. (2007) found that expression of miR378 (MIRN378; 611957)
enhanced cell survival and reduced caspase-3 (CASP3; 600636) activity in
human glioma cells. Injection of miR378-expressing glioma cells into
nude mice showed that miR378 promoted tumor growth and angiogenesis. Lee
et al. (2007) identified miR378 target sequences in the 3-prime UTRs of
SUFU and FUS1 (TUSC2; 607052) transcripts, and they found that miR378
downregulated expression of both transcripts. Transfection and
overexpression of either SUFU or FUS1 overcame the growth-promoting
effects of miR378. Expression of miR378 repressed expression of reporter
gene constructs harboring the miR378 target sites of SUFU or FUS1.
RT-PCR and Western blot analysis showed that repression of SUFU occurred
posttranscriptionally, and the levels of SUFU protein and miR378 were
inversely correlated in a human cell lines.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Split Hand/Foot Malformation 3

Grimm et al. (2001) found no mutations in the SUFU gene in patients with
split-hand/foot malformation type 3 (SHFM3; 246560).

Lyle et al. (2006) used FISH and quantitative PCR to narrow the SHFM3
locus to a minimal 325-kb duplication containing only the BTRC (603482)
and POLL (606343) genes. Expression analysis of 13 candidate genes
within and flanking the duplicated region showed that BTRC and SUFU,
present in 3 copies and 2 copies, respectively, were overexpressed in
SHFM3 patients compared to controls. Lyle et al. (2006) suggested that
SHFM3 may be caused by overexpression of BTRC and SUFU, both of which
are involved in beta-catenin signaling.

- Medulloblastoma

Bayani et al. (2000) showed that loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on 10q24
is frequent in medulloblastomas (155255), suggesting that this region
contains 1 or more tumor suppressor genes. Taylor et al. (2002) reported
children with medulloblastoma who carried germline and somatic mutations
in SUFU in the SHH pathway, accompanied by LOH of the wildtype allele
(see, e.g., 607035.0001-607035.0006). Several of these mutations encoded
truncated proteins that are unable to export the GLI transcription
factor (165220) from nucleus to cytoplasm, resulting in the activation
of SHH signaling. Thus, SUFU is a tumor suppressor gene that predisposes
individuals to medulloblastoma by modulating the SHH signaling pathway
through a newly identified mechanism.

Taylor et al. (2002) noted that all 4 medulloblastomas with SUFU
truncating mutations were of the desmoplastic subtype. Desmoplastic
tumors make up about 20 to 30% of medulloblastomas, have a more nodular
architecture than 'classical' medulloblastoma, and may have a better
prognosis. Activation of the SHH pathway is particularly high in
desmoplastic medulloblastomas, as shown by increased expression of the
SHH target genes GLI, SMOH (601500), and PTCH (601309).

Brugieres et al. (2010) identified germline truncating SUFU mutations in
2 unrelated families with several children under 3 years of age
diagnosed with medulloblastoma (607035.0005 and 607035.0006,
respectively). Among the 25 mutation carriers in the 2 families, 7
developed medulloblastomas; of the 5 tumors for which histology was
reviewed, 3 were classified as medulloblastoma with extensive nodularity
(MBEN) and 2 were typical desmoplastic/nodular medulloblastoma. No
obvious physical stigmata of nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome was
found among 21 mutation carriers from both families who were examined,
including 11 patients who underwent brain MRI. SUFU sequence analysis of
1 tumor from each family confirmed that only the mutant allele was
detected in the tumor DNA, thus demonstrating the loss of the wildtype
allele and supporting a tumor suppressor role for SUFU.

- Susceptibility to Familial Meningioma

In affected members of a Finnish family with multiple adult-onset
meningiomas (607174), Aavikko et al. (2012) identified a germline
heterozygous mutation in the SUFU gene (R123C; 607035.0007). The
mutation was identified by genomewide linkage analysis combined with
exome sequencing. Tumor tissue from 7 meningiomas showed loss of
heterozygosity at the SUFU locus, consistent with a 2-hit model for
tumor suppressor genes. In vitro functional expression studies in human
rhabdomyosarcoma cells showed that the R123C mutant protein had a
significantly decreased ability to suppress GLI1 activity compared to
wildtype SUFU, resulting in aberrant activation of the hedgehog
signaling pathway.

- Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome

In affected members of a family exhibiting atypical signs and symptoms
of Gorlin syndrome (basal cell nevus syndrome; 109400), who were known
to be negative for mutation in the PTCH1 gene, Pastorino et al. (2009)
identified a splice site mutation (607035.0003) that had previously been
found in a desmoplastic medulloblastoma by Taylor et al. (2002).

ANIMAL MODEL

Svard et al. (2006) found that ablation of the mouse Sufu gene led to
lethality at about embryonic day 9.5 with cephalic and neural tube
defects. Fibroblasts derived from Sufu-null embryos showed high
Gli-mediated Shh pathway activity that was unaffected by either Smo
agonists or antagonists, but was partially sensitive to Pka (see 176911)
inhibition. Despite robust constitutive activity of Sufu-null
fibroblasts, Gli1 localization remained cytoplasmic. Mice heterozygous
for Sufu deletion appeared normal and were fertile; however, they
developed a skin phenotype with basaloid changes and jaw keratocysts,
characteristic features of BCNS. Svard et al. (2006) concluded that, in
contrast to Drosophila, mammalian SUFU has a central role in SHH
signaling, and its loss of function leads to potent ligand-independent
activation of the SHH pathway.

Pospisilik et al. (2010) found that hedgehog signaling was an important
determinant of adipose cell fate in Drosophila. They targeted Sufu
deletion to adipose tissue in mice and found that the mutant mice, which
they called aP2-SufuKO, were born healthy and at mendelian ratios.
Mutant mice displayed an immediate and obvious lean phenotype with
reduced white, but not brown, adipose tissue. Adipocyte size and total
numbers were reduced in mutant animals, and this was associated with
elevated hedgehog signaling and dysregulation of early adipogenic
factors. Lack of cutaneous and subcutaneous adipose stores in mutant
mice also resulted in cold stress at normal room temperature, but not at
elevated temperature. The mutant mice showed normal glucose tolerance
and insulin sensitivity.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MEDULLOBLASTOMA, SOMATIC
SUFU, PRO15LEU

In a medulloblastoma tumor (155255), Taylor et al. (2002) observed a
nonconservative missense mutation, pro15 to leu (P15L), near the N
terminus of SUFU. The mutation was accompanied by LOH in the wildtype
allele. The amino acid change was caused by a 44C-T transition. The
morphology of the tumor was not known.

.0002
MEDULLOBLASTOMA, DESMOPLASTIC
SUFU, 1-BP INS, 143A

In a patient with medulloblastoma of desmoplastic type (155255), Taylor
et al. (2002) found a 1-bp insertion, 143insA, in exon 1 of the SUFU
gene. The mutation caused frameshift followed by termination codon 69 bp
3-prime to the mutation.

.0003
MEDULLOBLASTOMA, DESMOPLASTIC, SOMATIC
BASAL CELL NEVUS SYNDROME, INCLUDED
SUFU, IVS8, G-A, +1

In a desmoplastic medulloblastoma (155255), Taylor et al. (2002) found
an IVS8+1G-A splice donor site mutation in the SUFU gene. The mutation
resulted in a frameshift at the 5-prime end and termination at the
3-prime end of exon 9. This was the second hit in this tumor, the first
hit being a germline 2.5-Mb deletion (deletion encompassing SUFU;
607035.0004). The patient had some features suggesting basal cell nevus
syndrome (109400). In addition to severe cognitive impairment and global
developmental delay, facial features included frontal bossing, prominent
jaw, and hypertelorism. Additional FISH experiments using contiguous BAC
clones showed that the deletion was 2.5-2.8 Mb in size and included at
least 28 genes. The most centromeric gene studied, BTRC (603482), was
not included in the deletion. The deletion was not present in either
parent.

In a father and son exhibiting atypical signs and symptoms of basal cell
nevus syndrome (109400), Pastorino et al. (2009) identified the known
1022+1G-A splice site transition in the SUFU gene. The mutation was not
detected in the clinically unaffected paternal grandparents, suggesting
that it arose de novo in the father; the mutation was also not found in
200 control alleles.

MEDULLOBLASTOMA, WITH EXTENSIVE NODULARITY
SUFU, 1-BP DEL, 71C

In 2 brothers who were diagnosed with medulloblastoma with extensive
nodularity (MBEN; see 155255) within the first 3 months of life,
Brugieres et al. (2010) identified heterozygosity for a 1-bp deletion
(71delC) in exon 1 of the SUFU gene, resulting in a frameshift and
premature stop codon. The deletion was also identified in the unaffected
mother, as well as the maternal grandfather, who had leiomyosarcoma, and
2 other unaffected relatives. The deletion was not found in 70 controls.

.0006
MEDULLOBLASTOMA, DESMOPLASTIC
MEDULLOBLASTOMA WITH EXTENSIVE NODULARITY, INCLUDED
SUFU, 1-BP INS, 71C

In 3 female cousins diagnosed with medulloblastoma (155255) before 3
years of age, 2 of whom had the desmoplastic type and 1 with
medulloblastoma with extensive nodularity (MBEN), Brugieres et al.
(2010) identified heterozygosity for a 1-bp insertion (71insC) in exon 1
of the SUFU gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature stop codon.
The maternal aunt of 1 of the cousins also died of medulloblastoma in
childhood, and the sister of another of the cousins died suddenly at 18
months of age with postmortem radiologic findings that were consistent
with medulloblastoma. The insertion was present in 17 of 33 family
members, 1 of whom had breast cancer and another meningioma, but not
found in 70 controls.

.0007
MENINGIOMA, FAMILIAL, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
SUFU, ARG123CYS (dbSNP rs202247756)

In affected members of a Finnish family with multiple adult-onset
meningiomas (607174), Aavikko et al. (2012) identified a germline
heterozygous 367C-T transition in the SUFU gene, resulting in an
arg123-to-cys (R123C) substitution (dbSNP rs202247756) in the core of
the N-terminal subdomain, which is central for the loop structure of the
protein. The mutation, which was identified by genomewide linkage
analysis combined with exome sequencing, was not found in 180 controls.
Tumor tissue from 7 meningiomas showed loss of heterozygosity at the
SUFU locus. In vitro functional expression studies in human
rhabdomyosarcoma cells showed that the R123C mutant protein had a
significantly decreased ability to suppress GLI1 (165220) activity
compared to wildtype SUFU, resulting in aberrant activation of the
hedgehog signaling pathway. Compared to the wildtype protein, the mutant
protein was expressed at lower levels and also bound to GLI1 less well.
Mutant SUFU was also unable to relocalize GLI1 into the cytoplasm. These
studies all indicated that the R123C mutation results in a partial loss
of SUFU function. Mutations in the SUFU gene were not found in 162
additional Finnish patients with meningiomas.

604065	TITLE *604065 CALCIUM CHANNEL, VOLTAGE-DEPENDENT, T TYPE, ALPHA-1G SUBUNIT; CACNA1G
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Voltage-activated calcium channels can be distinguished based on their
voltage-dependence, deactivation, and single-channel conductance. See
601011. Low-voltage-activated calcium channels are referred to as 'T'
type because their currents are both transient, owing to fast
inactivation, and tiny, owing to small conductance. T-type channels are
thought to be involved in pacemaker activity, low-threshold calcium
spikes, neuronal oscillations and resonance, and rebound burst firing.

CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences related to calcium channels,
Perez-Reyes et al. (1998) identified a partial human cDNA encoding a
novel channel that they designated alpha-1G or Ca(V)T.1. The authors
used the partial cDNA to isolate additional human, rat, and mouse
alpha-1G cDNAs. Northern blot analysis of human and rat tissues
indicated that the alpha-1G gene was expressed as an 8.5-kb mRNA
predominantly in brain. An additional 9.7-kb transcript was also
detected. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, the rat alpha-1G channel
exhibited the properties of a low-voltage-activated T-type calcium
channel.

Jagannathan et al. (2002) found that multiple isoforms of CACNA1G and at
least 2 isoforms of CACNA1H (607904) are generated by alternative
splicing and are expressed in testis. In situ hybridization localized
transcripts both in germ cells and in other testis cell types. Within
cardiac tissue, both CACNA1G and CACNA1H were expressed in vascular
tissue and not in myocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

By whole-cell patch clamp, Jagannathan et al. (2002) detected T-type
voltage-operated Ca(2+) channel currents in isolated round spermatids.
Currents were consistent with those generated by CACNA1H or CACNA1G
channels.

By action potential clamp studies, Chemin et al. (2002) found
significant differences in the biochemical properties of CACNA1G,
CACNA1H, and CACNA1I (608230) following transient transfection in human
embryonic kidney cells. Using firing activities recorded in dissociated
rat cerebellar Purkinje neurons and thalamocortical relay neurons as
voltage-clamp waveforms, they showed that CACNA1I currents contributed
to sustained electrical activities, while CACNA1G and CACNA1H currents
generated short burst firing. Chemin et al. (2002) hypothesized that
each of the T-channel pore-forming subunits displays specific gating
properties that uniquely contribute to neuronal firing and that CACNA1I
channels provide pacemaker activity.

MAPPING

By FISH and radiation hybrid analysis, Perez-Reyes et al. (1998) mapped
the CACNA1G gene to 17q22. Using interspecific backcross analysis, they
mapped the mouse Cacna1g gene to the distal portion of chromosome 11, in
a region showing homology of synteny with 17q22.

ANIMAL MODEL

To investigate whether T-type Ca(2+) channels in thalamocortical relay
(TC) neurons are involved in the generation of spike-and-wave discharges
(SWDs), Kim et al. (2001) used gene targeting to generate a null
mutation of CACNA1G that encodes the pore-forming subunit of T-type
Ca(2+) channels. The knockout mice grew normally and were fertile.
General development of the brain and major organs appeared normal. Using
pharmacologic models, Kim et al. (2001) analyzed the ability of mutant
mice to generate SWDs. The thalamocortical relay neurons of the knockout
mice lacked the burst mode firing of action potentials, whereas they
showed the normal pattern of tonic mode firing. The knockout thalamus
was specifically resistant to the generation of SWDs in response to
GABA-B receptor (see 603540) activation. Kim et al. (2001) concluded
that the modulation of the intrinsic firing pattern mediated by CACNA1G
T-type Ca(2+) channels plays a critical role in the generation of GABA-B
receptor-mediated SWDs in the thalamocortical pathway, the hallmark of
absence seizures.

Sensations from viscera, like fullness, easily become painful if the
stimulus persists. Kim et al. (2003) demonstrated that mice lacking
alpha 1G T-type calcium channels show hyperalgesia to visceral pain.
Thalamic infusion of a T-type blocker induced similar hyperalgesia in
wildtype mice. In response to visceral pain, the ventroposterolateral
thalamic neurons evoked a surge of single spikes, which then slowly
decayed as T type-dependent burst spikes gradually increased. In
alpha-1G-deficient neurons, the single-spike response persisted without
burst spikes. Kim et al. (2003) concluded that T-type calcium channels
underlie an antinociceptive mechanism operating in the thalamus and that
their findings support the idea that burst firing plays a critical role
in sensory gating in the thalamus.

601313	TITLE *601313 POLYCYSTIN 1; PKD1
;;PKD1 GENE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Polycystin-1, encoded by the PKD1 gene, forms a complex with
polycystin-2 (PKD2; 173910) that regulates multiple signaling pathways
to maintain normal renal tubular structure and function (summary by Song
et al., 2009). Mutations in PKD1 and PKD2 cause polycystic kidney
disease (see 173900 and 613095, respectively).

CLONING

Characterization of the PKD1 gene had been complicated by rearrangements
on chromosome 16 resulting in homologous regions in 16p termed the
homologous gene (HG) area. All but 3.5 kb at the 3-prime end of the PKD1
transcript (which is approximately 14 kb in total) is encoded by a
region reiterated several times in the HG area. The HG region encodes 3
large transcripts of 21 kb (HG-A), 17 kb (HG-B), and 8.5 kb (HG-C), and
although these have 3-prime ends that differ from PKD1, they share
substantial homology to the PKD1 transcript over most of their length.
It was not known, however, whether the HG transcripts produce functional
proteins (summary by Hughes et al., 1995).

To overcome cloning problems caused by the HG region, Hughes et al.
(1995) isolated the full PKD1 gene using an exon-linking strategy. They
took RNA from a cell line containing PKD1 but not the duplicate HG loci
and cloned a cDNA contig of the entire PKD1 transcript. The predicted
PKD1 protein, called polycystin, is a glycoprotein with multiple
transmembrane domains and a cytoplasmic C-tail. The N-terminal
extracellular region of over 2,500 amino acids contains leucine-rich
repeats, a C-type lectin, 16 immunoglobulin-like repeats, and 4 type III
fibronectin-related domains. The findings indicated that polycystin is
an integral membrane protein involved in cell-cell/matrix interactions.

The International Polycystic Kidney Disease Consortium (1995) reported
the complete structure of the PKD1 gene and its protein. The PKD1
transcript contains 46 exons. The 14.5-kb PKD1 transcript encodes a
4,304-amino acid protein that has a novel domain architecture. The
N-terminal half of the protein consists of a mosaic of previously
described domains, including leucine-rich repeats flanked by
characteristic cysteine-rich structures, LDL-A and C-type lectin
domains, and 14 units of a novel 80 amino acid domain. The presence of
these domains suggested that the PKD1 protein is involved in adhesive
protein-protein and protein-carbohydrate interactions in the
extracellular compartment. They proposed a hypothesis that links the
predicted properties of the protein with the phenotypic features of
autosomal dominant PKD.

In a study of PKD1 mRNA with an RNase protection assay, Ward et al.
(1996) found widespread expression in adult tissue, with high levels in
brain and moderate signal in kidney. Expression of the PKD1 protein was
assessed in kidney, using monoclonal antibodies to a recombinant protein
containing the C terminus of the molecule. In fetal and adult kidney,
staining was restricted to epithelial cells. Expression in the
developing nephron was most prominent in mature tubules, with lesser
staining in Bowman capsule and the proximal ureteric bud. In later fetal
and adult kidney, strong staining persisted in cortical tubules with
moderate staining detected in the loops of Henle and collecting ducts.
The authors suggested that the major role of polycystin is in the
maintenance of renal epithelial differentiation and organization from
early fetal life. Polycystin expression, monitored at the mRNA level and
by immunohistochemistry, appeared higher in cystic epithelia, indicating
that the disease does not result from complete loss of the protein.

Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya et al. (1997) assembled an authentic full-length
PKD1 cDNA and demonstrated expression of polycystin in vitro. Polyclonal
antibodies directed against distinct extra- and intracellular domains
specifically immunoprecipitated in vitro translated polycystin. The
panel of antibodies was used to determine localization of polycystin in
renal epithelial and endothelial cell lines and tissues of fetal, adult,
and cystic origins. In normal adult kidney and maturing fetal nephrons,
polycystin expression was confined to epithelial cells of the distal
nephron and vascular endothelial cells. Expression in the proximal
nephron was observed only after injury-induced cell proliferation.
Polycystin expression was confined to ductal epithelium in liver,
pancreas, and breast, and restricted to astrocytes in normal brain. The
investigators found clear evidence for the membrane localization of
polycystin by both tissue sections and by confocal microscopy in
cultured renal and endothelial cells. When cultured cells made cell-cell
contact, polycystin was localized to the lateral membranes of cells in
contact. The data suggested that polycystin probably has a widespread
role in epithelial cell differentiation and maturation and in cell-cell
interactions.

GENE FUNCTION

It had been suggested that the different forms of autosomal dominant
polycystic kidney disease, PKD1 and PKD2, and perhaps a third form
result from defects in interactive factors involved in a common pathway.
The discovery of the genes for the 2 most common forms of ADPKD provided
an opportunity to test this hypothesis. Qian et al. (1997) described a
previously unrecognized coiled-coil domain within the C terminus of the
PKD1 gene product, polycystin-1, and demonstrated that it binds
specifically to the C terminus of the PKD2 gene product, polycystin-2
(173910). Homotypic interactions involving the C terminus of each were
also demonstrated. They showed that naturally occurring pathogenic
mutations of PKD1 and PKD2 disrupt their associations. Qian et al.
(1997) suggested that PKD1 and PKD2 associate physically in vivo and may
be partners of a common signaling cascade involved in tubular
morphogenesis.

Tsiokas et al. (1997) showed that PKD1 and PKD2 interact through their
C-terminal cytoplasmic tails. This interaction results in up-regulation
of PKD1 but not PKD2. Furthermore, the cytoplasmic tail of PKD2 but not
PKD1 forms homodimers through a coiled-coil domain distinct from the
region required for interaction with PKD1. These interactions suggested
that PKD1 and PKD2 may function through a common signaling pathway that
is necessary for normal tubulogenesis and that PKD1 requires the
presence of PKD2 for stable expression.

PKD1 is thought to encode a membrane protein, polycystin-1, involved in
cell-to-cell or cell-matrix interactions, whereas the PKD2 gene product,
polycystin-2, is thought to be a channel protein. Hanaoka et al. (2000)
demonstrated that polycystin-1 and -2 interact to produce new
calcium-permeable nonselective cation currents. Neither polycystin-1 nor
polycystin-2 alone is capable of producing currents. Moreover,
disease-associated mutant forms of either polycystin protein that are
incapable of heterodimerization through the coiled-coil domain do not
result in new channel activity. Hanaoka et al. (2000) also showed that
polycystin-2 is localized in the cell in the absence of polycystin-1,
but is translocated to the plasma membrane in its presence. Thus,
polycystin-1 and -2 coassemble at the plasma membrane to produce a new
channel and to regulate renal tubular morphology and function.

Grimm et al. (2003) found that mammalian polycystin-1 localized to the
cell surface and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in cells that did not
express polycystin-2. However, when the 2 proteins were coexpressed in
the same cell line, polycystin-1 colocalized exclusively with
polycystin-2 in the ER. Further work indicated that the subcellular
localization of polycystin-1 depended on the ratio of polycystin-2 to
polycystin-1 expression and that the localization of polycystin-1 could
be regulated via the relative expression level of polycystin-2.

A large proportion of the extracellular N terminus of polycystin-1 is
composed of 15 tandemly repeated PKD repeats (Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya et
al., 2000). Situated between the last PKD repeat and the first
transmembrane segment is the receptor for 'egg jelly' (REJ) domain,
which was originally described in sea urchin. Immediately following this
domain is a G protein-coupled receptor proteolytic site (GPS) domain
(Delmas et al., 2002). Qian et al. (2002) demonstrated that polycystin-1
undergoes cleavage at the GPS domain in a process that requires the REJ
domain. Most of the N-terminal fragment remains tethered at the cell
surface, although a small amount is secreted. PKD1-associated mutations
in the REJ domain disrupt cleavage, abolish the ability of polycystin-1
to activate signal transducer and activator of transcription-1, and
induce tubulogenesis in vitro. Qian et al. (2002) concluded that
cleavage of polycystin-1 is likely essential for its biologic activity.

Using antibodies raised against various domains of polycystin-1 and
against specific adhesion complex proteins, Scheffers et al. (2000)
determined that polycystin-1 was detected in the cytoplasm as well as
colocalizing with desmosomes of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells,
but not with tight or adherens junctions. They further confirmed the
desmosomal localization using confocal laser scanning and immunoelectron
microscopy. By performing a calcium switch experiment, the authors
demonstrated the sequential reassembly of tight junctions, subsequently
adherens junctions, and finally desmosomes. Polycystin-1 stained the
membrane only after incorporation of desmoplakin (125647) into the
desmosomes, suggesting that membrane-bound polycystin-1 may be important
for cellular signaling or cell adhesion, but not for the assembly of
adhesion complexes.

Because signaling from cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion complexes
regulates cell proliferation and polarity, Huan and van Adelsberg (1999)
speculated that polycystin-1 may interact with these complexes. They
showed that polycystin-1 colocalizes with the cell adhesion molecules
E-cadherin (CDH1; 192090) and alpha- (116805), beta- (116806), and
gamma-catenin. Polycystin-1 coprecipitated with these proteins and
comigrated with them on sucrose density gradients, but it did not
colocalize, coprecipitate, or comigrate with focal adhesion kinase
(600758), a component of the focal adhesion. Huan and van Adelsberg
(1999) concluded that polycystin-1 is in a complex containing E-cadherin
and alpha-, beta-, and gamma-catenin. These observations raised the
question of whether the defects in cell proliferation and cell polarity
observed in ADPKD are mediated by E-cadherin or the catenins.

Rodova et al. (2002) presented evidence for beta-catenin-induced
expression of PKD1. They analyzed the promoter region of PKD1 and
identified numerous transactivating factors, including 4 T-cell factor
(TCF)-binding elements (TBEs). Beta-catenin induced a reporter construct
containing TBE1 6-fold when cotransfected into HEK293T cells, which
express TCF4 (TCF7L2; 602228). Dominant-negative TCF4 or deletion of the
TBE1 sequence inhibited the induction. Gel shift assays confirmed that
TCF4 and beta-catenin could complex with the TBE1 site, and HeLa cells
stably transfected with beta-catenin responded with elevated levels of
endogenous PKD1 mRNA. Rodova et al. (2002) concluded that the PKD1 gene
is a target of the beta-catenin/TCF pathway.

Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya et al. (2000) showed that polycystin-1 is
localized to cell-cell contacts in kidney epithelial cell (MDCK)
cultures. In vitro binding assays demonstrated that the Ig-like domains
XI to XVI form interactions with high affinity, while domains II to V
interact with a lower affinity. Antibodies raised against Ig-like
domains of polycystin-1 disrupted cell-cell interactions in MDCK cell
monolayers. The authors hypothesized that interactions of the Ig-like
repeats of polycystin-1 play an important role in mediating
intercellular adhesion, and that loss of these interactions due to
mutations in polycystin-1 may be an important step in cystogenesis.

Boletta et al. (2000) described a novel cell culture system for studying
how PKD1 regulates the later stages of renal tubular differentiation.
They showed that expression of human PKD1 in MDCK cells slowed their
growth and protected them from programmed cell death. MDCK cells
expressing PKD1 also spontaneously formed branching tubules, while
control cells formed simple cysts. Increased cell proliferation and
apoptosis have been implicated in the pathogenesis of cystic diseases.
This study suggested that PKD1 may function to regulate both pathways,
allowing cells to enter a differentiation pathway that results in tubule
formation.

Bhunia et al. (2002) showed that expression of polycystin-1 activates
the JAK (see 147795)-STAT (see STAT1; 600555) pathway, thereby
upregulating WAF1 (CDKN1A; 116899) and inducing cell cycle arrest in
G0/G1. They found that this process requires polycystin-2 as an
essential cofactor. Mutations that disrupted binding of polycystin-1 and
-2 prevented activation of the pathway. Mouse embryos lacking Pkd1 had
defective Stat1 phosphorylation and Waf1 induction. These results
suggested that 1 function of the complex of polycystin-1 and -2 is to
regulate the JAK-STAT pathway and explained how mutations of either gene
can result in dysregulated growth.

Xu et al. (2001) provided experimental evidence for the interaction of
polycystin-1 with the intermediate filament network. They found that
vimentin (193060) binds the C terminus of mouse polycystin-1 in a yeast
2-hybrid screen of canine kidney cells. Deletion of the coiled-coil
sequence from either peptide abolished the interaction. By GST pull-down
and in vitro filament assembly analyses, they also found the
cytokeratins K8 (KRT8; 148060) and K18 (KRT18; 148070) able to bind the
coiled-coil region of polycystin-1. Immunolocalization of endogenous
polycystin-1 in canine kidney cells revealed discrete nodular junctional
staining that overlapped staining for cytokeratin and desmoplakin
(125647). With use of coimmunoprecipitation and cosedimentation
techniques, Newby et al. (2002) found that 7 to 8% of polycystin-2
colocalizes with polycystin-1 in plasma membrane fractions of both
normal human kidney and mouse kidney cells transgenic for human PKD1.
Polycystin-1 purified from transgenic mouse kidney cells was heavily
N-glycosylated, and both endoglycosidase (Endo-H)-sensitive and mature
Endo-H-resistant forms of the protein were able to interact with
polycystin-2. Newby et al. (2002) interpreted these results to suggest
early association of the 2 proteins in the ER/cis-Golgi prior to complex
glycosylation and insertion into the plasma membrane.

Bukanov et al. (2002) utilized a 3-dimensional MDCK in vitro model of
tubulogenesis and cystogenesis to demonstrate that polycystin-1 is a
novel component of desmosomal junctions of epithelial cells.
Downregulation of polycystin-1 mRNA was detected in cysts as compared to
tubules, leading to altered protein expression and localization. While
polycystin-1 was localized to basolateral membranes of MDCK tubules, it
was only detected in cytoplasmic pools in cystic cells. Polycystin-1 was
not detected in intercellular contacts at early steps of tubulogenesis,
but assumed its basolateral localization at the time of cell
polarization and lumen formation. During a similar morphologic process,
upregulation of polycystin-1 mRNA and protein levels was noted as a
pancreatic ductal epithelial cell line underwent in vitro
differentiation, resulting in dome formation. The authors suggested that
the loss of polycystin-1 from its basolateral location in tubular
epithelium may alter critical pathways controlling normal tubulogenesis
leading to cystic transformation.

ADPKD is associated with altered endothelial-dependent vasodilation and
decreased vascular production of NO. Thus, eNOS (163729) could have a
modifier effect in ADPKD. In order to test this hypothesis, Persu et al.
(2002) genotyped 173 unrelated European ADPKD patients for the
glu298-to-asp (163729.0001), intron 4 VNTR, and -786T-C (163729.0002)
polymorphisms of ENOS and looked for their influence on the age at
end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In 93 males, the glu298-to-asp
polymorphism was associated with a lower age at ESRD. This effect was
confirmed in a subset of males linked to PKD1 and reaching ESRD before
age 45, and by a cumulative renal survival analysis in PKD1-linked
families. Further studies demonstrated that NOS activity was decreased
in renal artery samples from PKD males harboring the asp298 allele, in
association with posttranslational modifications and partial cleavage of
eNOS. No significant effect of the other polymorphisms was found in
males, and no polymorphism influenced the age at ESRD in females. Persu
et al. (2002) concluded that glu298-to-asp is associated with a 5 year
lower mean age at ESRD in a subset of ADPKD males. They hypothesized
that the effect could be due to decreased NOS activity and a partial
cleavage of eNOS, leading to a further decrease in the vascular
production of NO.

Nauli et al. (2003) showed that polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 in mice
codistribute in the primary cilia of kidney epithelium. Cells isolated
from transgenic mice that lacked functional polycystin-1 formed cilia
but did not increase Ca(2+) influx in response to physiologic fluid
flow. Blocking antibodies directed against polycystin-2 similarly
abolished the flow response in wildtype cells as did inhibitors of the
ryanodine receptor (RYR1; 180901), whereas inhibitors of G proteins,
phospholipase C (see 600220), and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors
had no effect. These data suggested that polycystin-1 and polycystin-2
contribute to fluid-flow sensation by the primary cilium in renal
epithelium and that they both function in the same mechanotransduction
pathway. Loss or dysfunction of polycystin-1 or polycystin-2 may
therefore lead to polycystic kidney disease owing to the inability of
cells to sense mechanical cues that normally regulate tissue
morphogenesis. Calvet (2003) reproduced a scanning electron micrograph
of the inside of a collecting-duct cyst from a human autosomal dominant
polycystic kidney, showing a single intercalated cell surrounded by
principal cells, each with 1 or several primary cilia. Although the
cilia on these cells appeared normal, they were presumably functionally
defective because of the mutation in the PKD1 or PKD2 gene.

In mouse kidneys and MDCK cell lines, Chauvet et al. (2004) demonstrated
that polycystin-1 undergoes proteolytic cleavage that releases its
C-terminal tail, which enters the nucleus and initiates signaling
processes. Using a ureteral ligation mouse model, they showed that the
cleavage occurs in vivo in association with alterations in mechanical
stimuli. Polycystin-2 was observed to modulate the signaling properties
of the polycystin-1 C-terminal tail. Chauvet et al. (2004) concluded
that this represents a pathway by which polycystin-1 transmits messages
directly to the nucleus.

Following its nuclear translocation in MDCK cells, Low et al. (2006)
found that the C-terminal tail of human polycystin-1 interacted with
Stat6 (601512) and P100 (602181) and stimulated Stat6-dependent gene
expression. Under normal conditions, Stat6 localized to primary cilia of
renal epithelial cells; however, cessation of apical fluid flow resulted
in its nuclear translocation. Cyst-lining cells in ADPKD exhibited
elevated levels of nuclear STAT6, P100, and the polycystin-1 C-terminal
tail. Exogenous expression of the human polycystin-1 C-terminal tail
resulted in renal cyst formation in zebrafish embryos. Low et al. (2006)
concluded that upregulation of the STAT6/P100 pathway by the
polycystin-1 C-terminal tail leads to the cellular changes
characteristic of renal cysts.

Li et al. (2005) found that polycystin-2 overexpression in human
embryonic kidney cells led to reduced cell proliferation. They showed
that polycystin-2 interacted directly with ID2 (600386) and modulated
the cell cycle via the ID2-CDKN1A-CDK2 (116953) pathway. The
ID2-polycystin-2 interaction caused sequestration of ID2 in the
cytoplasm and required polycystin-1-dependent serine phosphorylation of
polycystin-2. Kidney epithelial cells from a mouse model of PKD1 showed
abnormalities in the cell cycle that could be reversed by RNA
interference-mediated inhibition of Id2 mRNA expression.

Shillingford et al. (2006) found that the cytoplasmic tail of PC1
interacted with tuberin (191092), a regulator of MTOR (FRAP1; 601231)
kinase activity, and that the MTOR pathway was inappropriately activated
in cyst-lining epithelial cells from human ADPKD patients and mouse
models. Rapamycin, an inhibitor of MTOR, was effective in reducing renal
cystogenesis in 2 independent mouse models of PKD, and it appeared to
reduce renal cysts, at least partially, by selective induction of
apoptosis and luminal shedding of cyst-lining epithelial cells.
Advanced-stage ADPKD patients frequently receive a renal transplant
without removal of the affected cystic kidneys, and rapamycin is often
used to prevent transplant rejection. Shillingford et al. (2006) found
that patients treated with rapamycin had a statistically significant
reduction in native polycystic kidney size over a period of 24 months
compared with patients treated with other antirejection drugs.

Sharif-Naeini et al. (2009) showed that mouse Pkd1 and Pkd2, which they
called Trpp1 and Trpp2, could regulate stretch-activated ion channels
and were involved in pressure sensing.

MAPPING

Reeders et al. (1985) showed that the PKD1 locus is closely linked to
the alpha-globin locus (HBA1; 141800) on 16p (lod = 25.85, theta = 0.05,
99% confidence limits = 2-11 cM). In establishing this linkage, they
used a highly polymorphic region about 8 kb beyond the 3-prime end of
the alpha-globin cluster (3-prime-HVR = 3-prime-hypervariable region).
In the Oxford data (Reeders, 1985), APKD versus phosphoglycolate
phosphatase (PGP; 172280) showed a lod score of 8.21 at theta = 0.0. PGP
and HBA showed a lod score of 11.61 at theta = 0.0. In 13 South Wales
kindreds, Lazarou et al. (1987) found a maximum lod score of 24.187 at a
recombination fraction of 0.03 for linkage between PKD1 and
alpha-globin. Despite phenotypic heterogeneity, they found no evidence
of linkage heterogeneity.

Watson et al. (1987) found tight linkage of APKD and PGP; the maximum
likelihood value of the recombination fraction was 0.0 with a lod score
of 5.5. Together with the APKD versus HVR linkage data, these findings
suggested to them that APKD and PGP are on the 5-prime side of the
alpha-globin cluster. The polarity of the HBAC gene cluster viz-a-viz
the centromere is unknown. The recombination fraction for the
3-prime-HVR and APKD is somewhat greater in males than in females
(Reeders, 1986)--an anomalous finding. Reeders et al. (1985) found no
definite recombination between PGP and APKD. HBAC is distal to APKD but
whether PGP is proximal or distal to APKD is unknown. The evidence on
location of HBAC was conflicting, with assignments from 16p13.11 to
16p13.33. Reeders et al. (1988) described an array of linked markers
that bracket the PKD1 locus. Germino et al. (1990) demonstrated a DNA
marker, D16S84, that showed no recombination with PKD1 in 201
informative meioses.

Pound et al. (1992) presented evidence for linkage disequilibrium
between PKD1 and D16S94. Breuning et al. (1990) further defined the
location of markers on 16p in the vicinity of the PKD1 locus. Harris et
al. (1991) identified closely linked microsatellite polymorphisms that
could be used in a PCR-based assay for a rapid, inexpensive, and
nonradioactive method of linkage analysis.

Gal et al. (1989) studied 10 families in which early manifestation of
the disorder was a frequent finding. In all families studied, close
linkage was observed between the chromosome 16 alpha-globin marker and
the APKD locus. They concluded that there is no evidence for genetic
heterogeneity of APKD in families with early- and later-onset disease.
In 28 northern European pedigrees from England, Scotland, Holland, and
eastern Finland, Reeders et al. (1987) found no evidence of
heterogeneity of the linkage of PKD1 with alpha-globin. (The recessive
form of early-onset polycystic kidney disease is probably not linked to
HBA (Reeders, 1986).)

Zerres et al. (1993) also investigated 79 children with early
manifestation of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD).
They belonged to 64 families (64 index patients and 15 affected sibs).
Early manifestation was defined as clinical manifestations
(hypertension, proteinuria, impaired renal function, palpably enlarged
kidneys) occurring before the age of 15 years. A strong familial
clustering for early manifesting ADPKD was found; out of the total of 65
sibs of the 64 index patients, 15 showed comparably early manifestation.
Another 10 symptom-free children were diagnosed sonographically as
having ADPKD before the age of 18 years. The authors noted that high
recurrence risk to sibs has important implications for genetic
counseling and clinical care of affected families.

Among the same 17 families reported by Bear et al. (1984, 1992), Parfrey
et al. (1990) found that polycystic kidney disease cosegregated with
polymorphic DNA markers flanking the PKD1 locus in 10; in 2 families
cosegregation did not occur, and in 5 families linkage could not be
determined because of uninformativeness of the markers.

Ryynanen et al. (1987) did linkage studies in a 4-generation Finnish
family with polycystic kidney disease; all affected members of the
extended pedigree were asymptomatic and none had developed renal
failure. They showed that the mutation in this family was closely linked
to the alpha-globin cluster. This might be an allelic disorder. Using
DNA from a set of multigenerational families from CEPH (Centre d'etude
polymorphisme humaine, Paris), Keith et al. (1987) constructed a genetic
map of chromosome 16 based on 40 polymorphic DNA markers. The map
spanned 142 cM in males, somewhat larger than the 108 cM previously
estimated by chiasma counts. Males had higher recombination fractions
near the alpha-globin gene cluster, but females showed higher
recombination in other regions.

Germino et al. (1992) demonstrated that the PKD1 gene lies within an
extremely CpG-rich 750-kb segment of 16p13.3. Its genetic localization
with respect to physically mapped markers in this segment was refined by
Somlo et al. (1992).

In the Spanish population, Peral et al. (1993) typed 31 families from
different geographic areas using marker loci flanking PKD1 on 16p.
Multilocus linkage analysis indicated that in 26 families the disease
resulted from PKD1 mutations, whereas in 3 families it resulted from
mutations in a locus other than PKD1; 2 other families were not
informative. Using the HOMOG test, they estimated that PKD1-linked
mutations were responsible for 85% of families with PKD in Spain.

The 400-Mb genome of the Japanese pufferfish, Fugu rubripes, is
relatively free of repetitive DNA and contains genes with small introns
at high density. Sandford et al. (1996) demonstrated that the genes that
are mutant in polycystic kidney disease-1 and tuberous sclerosis-2
(TSC2; 191092) are conserved in the Fugu genome where they are tightly
linked. In addition, sequences homologous to the SSTR5 gene (182455)
were identified 5-prime to PKD1, defining a larger syntenic region. As
in genomes of mouse and human, the Fugu TSC2 and PKD1 genes are adjacent
in a tail-to-tail orientation.

- PKD1 Pseudogenes

A large part of the PKD1 gene is duplicated in an unknown number of
homologous genes (HG) which are located on chromosome 16p13.1 and share
approximately 95% homology with the PKD1 gene (Hughes et al., 1995).
Bogdanova et al. (2001) examined the expression of 5 of these homologous
genes located proximal to PKD1. They used RT-PCR of total RNA and mRNA
associated within polysomes isolated from a human glioblastoma cell line
in which polycystins are well expressed. Analysis of the products
suggested that the homologs produce mRNA species with suboptimal start
codons and that these mRNA species are not translated. Bogdanova et al.
(2001) concluded that the homologs are pseudogenes.

PATHOGENESIS

To elucidate the molecular pathways that modulate renal cyst growth in
ADPKD, Song et al. (2009) used cDNA microarray gene profiling of cysts
of different size and minimally cystic tissue (MCT) from 5 PKD1 human
polycystic kidneys. The authors found downregulation of kidney
epithelial-restricted genes (e.g., nephron segment-specific markers and
cilia-associated cystic genes such as HNF1B (189907), PKHD1 (606702),
IFT88 (600595), and CYS1) in the PKD1 renal cysts. Upregulated genes in
PKD1 cysts included those associated with renal development,
mitogen-mediated proliferation, cell cycle progression,
epithelial-mesenchymal transition, hypoxia, aging, and
immune/inflammatory responses. The authors suggested that upregulated
signaling of Wnt/beta-catenin, pleiotropic growth factors, such as VEGF
(192240), and G protein-coupled receptors, such as PTGER2 (176804), was
associated with renal cystic growth. By integrating these pathways with
a number of dysregulated networks of transcription factors, including
SRF (600589), Song et al. (2009) suggested that epithelial
dedifferentiation accompanied by aberrant activation and crosstalk of
specific signaling pathways may be required for PKD1 cyst growth and
disease progression.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hughes et al. (1995) determined that the 14,148-bp PKD1 transcript is
distributed among 46 exons spanning 52 kb.

Lantinga-van Leeuwen et al. (2005) determined that the promoter region
of both the PKD1 and PKD2 genes are TATA-less, but they have binding
sites for E2F (see 189971), EGRF (see EGR1; 128990), ETS (see 600541),
MZF1 (194550), SP1 (189906), and ZBP89 (601867). The PKD1 promoter also
contains an E box, MINI (muscle initiator sequence) motif, and a binding
site for AP2 (107580). Deletion studies of the mouse Pkd1 promoter
identified a 280-bp fragment capable of driving reporter gene
expression, whereas reporter constructs containing larger fragments of
the promoter showed lower activity. Mutating a potential E2f-binding
site within the 280-bp fragment diminished reporter activity, suggesting
a role for E2F in regulating cell cycle-dependent expression of the PKD1
gene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The European Polycystic Kidney Disease Consortium (1994) isolated a gene
encoding a 14-kb transcript that was disrupted by a chromosome
translocation in a family with PKD1. Indeed, the unusual Portuguese
family had both PKD and tuberous sclerosis (TSC2; 191092), which maps to
the same region of 16p. The mother had a balanced translocation, 46,XX
t(16;22)(p13.3;q11.21), which was inherited by her daughter. The son, on
the other hand, had an unbalanced karyotype 45,XY with monosomy for
16pter-p13.3 as well as for 22pter-q11.21. This individual had the
clinical phenotype of tuberous sclerosis which was thought to be due to
the fact that the TSC2 locus located within 16p13.3 was deleted in the
unbalanced karyotype. The mother and the daughter with the balanced
translocation had the clinical features of PKD1, while the parents of
the mother were cytogenetically normal, with no clinical features of
tuberous sclerosis and no renal cysts on ultrasound examination. The
location of the breakpoint in the balanced translocation was more than
20 kb proximal to the TSC2 locus. The consortium isolated a gene
spanning the breakpoint and designated it PBP (for 'polycystic
breakpoint'). They then identified mutations in the PBP gene in other
patients with PKD1. The first mutation found was a 5.5-kb genomic
deletion within the 3-prime end of the PBP gene in an affected woman and
in paraffin-embedded tissue from her affected father (deceased at the
time of report). The second rearrangement detected was a 2-kb genomic
deletion within the PBP gene which was found to have a frameshift
deletion of 446 bp (between basepairs 1746 and 2192). This was a de novo
mutation. Sequencing of genomic DNA in another patient demonstrated a
G-to-C transition at the +1 position of the splice donor site following
the 135-bp exon. The splicing defect resulted in an in-frame deletion of
135-bp from the PBP transcript (basepairs 3696 to 3831). A fourth
patient was described in which both the TSC2 gene and the PKD1 gene were
deleted. Further study indicated that the deletion extended over
approximately 100 kb and deleted most, if not all, of the PKD1 gene. By
'zoo blotting,' the consortium demonstrated that the PKD1 gene is
conserved in other mammalian species, including horse, dog, pig, and
rodents. No related sequences were seen by hybridization at normal
stringency in chicken, frog, or fruit fly. Wunderle et al. (1994)
pointed out that 3 explanations are classically used to account for
dominant inheritance in a disorder such as PKD1: haploinsufficiency,
gain-of-function mutations (including dominant negative effects), and
2-hit mechanisms (a second somatic mutation being required to give rise
to defective cells).

Harris et al. (1990) found that the region around the PKD1 locus is
unusually rich in CpG dinucleotides. In a search for the gene that is
mutant in polycystic kidney disease, Gillespie et al. (1991)
concentrated on CpG islands in a region between 2 markers that flank the
PKD1 locus and are separated by less than 750 kb. One of the genes so
marked, ATP6C (108745), was isolated from HeLa and cultured cystic
kidney epithelial cell cDNA libraries. It was found to encode a
155-amino acid peptide having 4 putative transmembrane domains. The
corresponding transcript was found in all tissues tested but was most
abundant in brain and kidney. The deduced amino acid sequence showed 93%
similarity to part of the proton channel of vacuolar H(+)-ATPase.
Because of the possible role of a mutated proton channel in the
pathogenesis of cystic disease, Gillespie et al. (1991) sequenced cDNAs
corresponding to both alleles of an affected individual but found no
differences in the deduced amino acid sequence. Moreover, transcript
size and abundance were not altered in cystic kidney.

Peral et al. (1995) sought mutations in the PKD1 gene in this disorder.
Analysis of 3 regions in the 3-prime part of the gene revealed 2
mutations that occurred by a novel mechanism. Both were deletions (of 18
or 20 bp) within the same 75-bp intron and, although these deletions did
not disrupt the splice donor or acceptor sites at the boundary of the
intron, they nevertheless resulted in aberrant splicing. Two different
transcripts were produced in each case; one included the normally
deleted intron while the other had a 66-bp deletion due to activation of
a cryptic 5-prime splice site. No normal product was generated from the
deletion-mutant gene. Peral et al. (1995) speculated that aberrant
splicing probably occurred because the deletion made the intron too
small for spliceosome assembly using the authentic splice sites. They
also identified a 9-bp direct repeat within the intron, which probably
facilitated the intronic deletion by promoting misalignment of sequence.

At a point when only 7 mutations in the PKD1 gene had been described,
Peral et al. (1996) reported a systematic screen covering nearly 80% of
the approximately 2.5 kb of translated transcript that is encoded by a
single-copy DNA. They identified and characterized 6 novel mutations
that, together with the previously described changes, amounted to a
detection rate of 10 to 15% in the population studied. Study of the PKD1
mutation search in the PKD1 gene is complicated by the fact that most of
the gene lies in a genomic region reiterated several times elsewhere on
chromosome 16. The results of the study of Peral et al. (1996) have
important implications for genetic diagnosis of PKD1 because they
indicate that most of the mutations lie within the duplicated area which
is difficult to study. They provided a diagram of the structure of the
polycystin protein with an indication of the site of the mutations
described to date. Comparison of the phenotypes of patients with large
frameshifting or terminating changes and those with more subtle in-frame
changes showed no obvious differences, suggesting that they may all be
inactivating changes. They cited evidence of an alternatively spliced
form of PKD1 that contains an additional exon in intron 16. Inclusion of
this exon would change the reading frame and result in the production of
a much smaller protein product. Hence they suggested that all PKD1
mutations may be inactivating, but those in typical families disrupt
just the full-length polycystin, whereas those associated with large
deletions disrupt both forms of the PKD1 protein, resulting in a more
severe, early-onset disease.

Neophytou et al. (1996) identified an intragenic polymorphism in the
coding region of the gene. Alanine at position 4091 is encoded by either
GCA or GCG. In the Cypriot population this polymorphism had a
heterozygosity of 35%. Neophytou et al. (1996) reported that this
polymorphism is readily detectable with the enzyme Bsp1286I. They
considered this intragenic polymorphism to be highly useful in
informative families, given the instability of the PKD1 region. They
also identified a 12258T-A mutation that led to premature termination of
translation (601313.0006).

Reeders (1992) put forward an interesting 2-hit mutational hypothesis
for PKD1. He pointed out the several unusual features such as the
absence of detectable abnormalities in most nephrons; even in the
end-stage disease, less than 10% of the roughly 1 million nephrons in
each kidney contain cysts. Furthermore, any segment of the nephron, from
the glomerulus to the collecting duct, may harbor a cyst. The hypothesis
suggests that at the sites of cyst formation, a somatic mutation occurs
in the chromosome 16 that does not carry the inherited mutation. A
prediction of the 2-hit model is that renal cysts will occasionally be
found in persons without an inherited predisposition as a result of 2
somatic mutations occurring in a single cell. One or 2 renal cysts are a
common radiologic finding in the general population and the probability
of finding a cyst in an individual does, as predicted, rise with age.
The 2-hit model predicts that the number of cysts would increase with
age in PKD1.

ADPKD is characterized by progressive cyst formation in a variety of
organs outside the kidney, including liver and pancreas. Using DNA from
the liver cysts of 2 donors with ADPKD, Watnick et al. (1998) showed
that intragenic, somatic mutations (frameshifts, nonsense codons, severe
splicing mutations, and loss of heterozygosity) are common in hepatic
cysts. All pathogenic mutations were shown to have altered the
previously normal copy of the gene. These data extend the 2-hit model of
cystogenesis to include a second focal manifestation of the disease.

Qian et al. (1996) developed a novel method for isolating renal cystic
epithelia from single cysts and showed that individual renal cysts in
PKD1 are monoclonal. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was discovered within
a subset of cysts for 2 closely linked polymorphic markers located
within the PKD1 gene. Genetic analysis revealed that it was the normal
haplotype that was lost. The findings provided a molecular explanation
for the focal nature of cyst formation and a probable mechanism whereby
mutations cause disease. The high rate at which 'second hits' must occur
to account for the large number of cysts observed suggested to Qian et
al. (1996) that unique structural features of the PKD1 gene may be
responsible for its mutability. (This is a remarkable example of the
Knudson mechanism which has been established in a considerable number of
neoplasms. VAM.) They previously reported an extremely unusual 2.5-kb
polypyrimidine tract within intron 21 of the PKD1 gene that they
postulated as being responsible for the gene's increased rate of
mutation (Burn et al., 1995). Qian et al. (1996) postulated that the
polypyrimidine tract may cause ongoing errors in its
transcription-coupled repair, thus resulting in a high frequency of
somatic mutation. Thus, they concluded that PKD1 is a recessive
disorder, when viewed at the level of the individual renal lesions.

Mutation screening of the PKD1 gene is complicated by the large
transcript size (more than 14 kb) and by reiteration of the genomic area
encoding 75% of the protein on the same chromosome. The sequence
similarity between the duplicated region precludes specific analysis for
mutations and consequently mutations were first identified in the unique
3-prime region of PKD1. Peral et al. (1997) developed a novel anchored
RT-PCR approach to amplify specifically duplicated regions of PKD1,
employing 1 primer situated within the single-copy region and 1 within
the reiterated area. This strategy was incorporated in a mutation screen
of 100 patients for more than half of the PKD1 exons (exons 22 to 46;
37% of the coding region), including 11 (exons 22 to 32) within the
duplicated gene region, by use of the protein-truncation test (PTT).
Sixty of the patients were also screened for missense changes, by use of
the nonisotopic RNase cleavage assay (NIRCA), in exons 23 to 36. In this
way, Peral et al. (1997) identified 11 mutations, 6 within the
duplicated region: 3 stop mutations, 3 frameshifting deletions of 1
nucleotide, 2 splicing defects, and 3 possible missense changes. Each
mutation was detected in just 1 family, although 1 had been described
previously; no mutation hotspot was identified. The nature and
distribution of mutations, plus the lack of a clear phenotype/genotype
correlation, suggested that the mutations may inactivate the molecule.
Peral et al. (1997) recommended RT-PCR/PTT as a rapid and efficient
method to detect PKD1 mutations and differentiate pathogenic changes
from polymorphisms.

Constantinides et al. (1997) reported a new amino acid polymorphism,
ala/val4058, with allelic frequencies of 0.88 and 0.12, respectively,
and a heterozygosity of 0.23, in the Greek and Greek-Cypriot
populations. The val4058 polymorphism occurred on the background of the
ala4091-G allele of the ala4091-A/G polymorphism, previously described
by Neophytou et al. (1996) and Peral et al. (1996). Neither polymorphism
was observed in 44 Japanese subjects, leading Constantinides et al.
(1997) to suggest that these polymorphic alleles would be useful for
linkage analysis only in specific ethnic groups.

A major challenge faced by researchers attempting to do a complete
mutation analysis of the PKD1 gene is the presence of several homologous
loci, also located on chromosome 16. Because the sequence of PKD1 and
its homologs is nearly identical in the 5-prime region of the gene, most
traditional approaches to mutation analysis cannot distinguish sequence
variants occurring uniquely in PKD1. Although linkage information
indicates that mutations in PKD1 account for approximately 85% of all
autosomal dominant PKD, relatively few mutations were identified in the
4-year period following the identification of the gene in 1994, and most
were clustered in the unique portion of the gene. Approximately 70% of
the length of the gene is present in at least 3 faithful copies at
16p13.1. The duplicated region extends from exon 1 to intron 34 and
includes all intervening sequences. The PKD1 copies are transcribed but
their respective mRNA molecules can be distinguished from authentic PKD1
transcripts on the basis of size. Furthermore, bisecting intron 21 of
PKD1 is an unusual polypyrimidine tract of approximately 2.5 kb. This
element is also present in the PKD1 homologs.

To study the duplicated region of PKD1, Watnick et al. (1997) devised a
novel strategy that depends on long-range PCR and a single gene-specific
primer from the unique region of the gene to amplify a PKD1-specific
template that spans exons 23 to 34. This 10-kb template, amplified from
genomic DNA, can be employed for mutation analysis using a wide range of
sequence-based approaches. Using this long-range PCR strategy to screen
for sequence variants with heteroduplex analysis, Watnick et al. (1997)
identified several affected individuals with clusters of basepair
substitutions in exons 23 and 25. In 2 patients, these changes,
identified in exon 23, would be predicted to result in multiple amino
acid substitutions in a short stretch of the protein. This unusual
clustering of basepair substitutions suggested that mutation may result
from unique structural features of the PKD1 gene. The observation that
renal cysts are due to somatic mutations and the high frequency of
'second hits' implied by this in hereditary polycystic kidney disease
also suggests an unusual mechanism of mutation. Watnick et al. (1997)
observed that the PKD1 gene has 3 long polypyrimidine tracts within
introns 1, 21, and 22, the longest of which is 2.5 kb in intron 21. The
tract in intron 21 was the longest polypyrimidine tract sequenced to
that time and contains 23 mirror repeats with stem lengths of at least
10 nucleotides. They predicted that the mirror repeats are likely to
form H-DNA structures composed of a triple helix conformation under
appropriate conditions. Triple helix structures can promote localized
mutagenesis in cultured cells. The unusual pattern of clustered multiple
basepair substitutions is consistent with that associated with triple
helix formation.

Roelfsema et al. (1997) reduced the problem in mutation detection posed
by the HG region by use of the protein-truncation test. They identified
8 novel mutations, 7 of which were located in the repeated part of the
PKD1 gene (e.g., 601313.0008).

Watnick et al. (1997) devised a strategy for mutation detection in the
duplicated region of PKD1. The method used 1 gene-specific primer, PKD1,
as an anchor in combination with a primer from the duplicated portion to
amplify PKD1-specific templates that are approximately 10 kb long and
include exons 23 to 34 or exons 23 to 38. They demonstrated that the
3-prime long-range PCR product (3-prime-LR) is PKD1 specific once it has
been diluted sufficiently to remove genomic contamination and could be
used for nested PCR of any exon contained within it. These products
could then be analyzed for PKD1 mutations with conventional methods such
as heteroduplex or single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP)
analysis. Using this technique, Watnick et al. (1997) identified an
unusual cluster of nearly identical basepair transitions involving exon
23 in 2 unrelated individuals. These changes were predicted to result in
multiple nonconservative amino acid substitutions in a short stretch of
the protein. Both the unusual pattern of these mutations and their
apparent independent origin prompted Watnick et al. (1998) to test
whether these sequence differences could have arisen through gene
conversion since pseudogenes had been known to be reservoirs for
mutations by this mechanism for a number of other diseases, such as
Gaucher disease and congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase
deficiency (201910). Using changes in restriction digest patterns, they
showed that these sequence substitutions were also present in a
rodent-human somatic cell hybrid that contained only the PKD1 homologs.
Moreover, these changes were also detected in total DNA from several
affected and unaffected individuals that did not harbor this mutation in
their PKD1 gene copy. Although PKD1 and CYP21, the gene mutant in
congenital adrenal hyperplasia, resemble each other in some respects,
they differ in the number and proximity of their homologous loci. The
PKD1 gene is replicated in at least 3 copies that are located megabases
away, while CYP21 has only 1 tandemly repeated unit. Multiple adjacent
nucleotide substitutions have been described in the von Willebrand
factor gene (VWF; 613160) on chromosome 12 that mimic the sequence of
its pseudogene located on chromosome 22 (Eikenboom et al., 1994). Murti
et al. (1994) demonstrated gene conversion between unlinked sequences in
the germline of mice. Gene conversion, first studied extensively in
yeast, is the nonreciprocal exchange of genetic information. Gene
conversion and recombination may be related processes that involve
pairing of homologous sequences except that in gene conversion, genetic
information is transferred from the donor gene to the recipient without
the donor being modified in the process. The fact that both PKD1 and its
homologs contain unusual polypyrimidine tracts that are situated in
adjacent introns may promote nonreciprocal recombination leading to gene
conversion. They postulated that these polypyrimidine tracts form triple
helices under appropriate conditions that could conceivably contribute
to mutagenesis by more than 1 mechanism. Gene conversion may also
account for the apparently high mutation rate, both somatic and
germline, in the PKD1 gene. A high germline mutation is suggested by the
frequency of polycystic kidney disease, which is estimated to be as high
as 1 in 1,000 individuals, and by the high somatic mutation rate that is
required, each with a separate second mutational event. It is possible,
furthermore, that somatic mutation in the PKD1 gene represents the
second hit in the case of the multiple cysts of PKD2 and PKD3 (Germino,
1998).

Thomas et al. (1999) concluded that when long-range PCR is applied to
identify mutations in the duplicated part of the PKD1 gene, coupled with
existing mutation detection methods, virtually the whole of this large,
complex gene can be screened for mutations. By means of a PKD1-specific
primer in intron 1, they used an approximately 13.6-kb PCR product that
includes exons 2 to 15 of the PKD1 gene to search for mutations by
direct sequence analysis. This region contains the majority of the
predicted extracellular domains of the PKD1 gene product, polycystin,
including the 16 novel PKD domains that have similarity to
immunoglobulin-like domains found in many cell adhesion molecules and
cell surface receptors. In 24 unrelated patients, 7 novel mutations were
found: 2 deletions (1 of 3 kb and the other of 28 bp), 1 single-base
insertion, and 4 nucleotide substitutions (1 splice site, 1 nonsense,
and 2 missense). Five of these mutations were predicted to cause a
prematurely truncated protein. Two coding and 18 silent polymorphisms
were also found.

It is known that several of the most severe complications of autosomal
dominant polycystic kidney disease, such as intracranial aneurysms,
cluster in families. Watnick et al. (1999) described a cluster of 4 bp
in exon 15 that is unique to PKD1. Forward and reverse PKD1-specific
primers were designed in this location to amplify regions of the gene
from exons 11 to 21 by use of long-range PCR. The 2 templates described
were used to analyze 35 pedigrees selected for study because they
included individuals with either intracranial aneurysms and/or very
early-onset disease. Watnick et al. (1999) identified 8 novel truncating
mutations, 2 missense mutations not found in a panel of controls, and
several informative polymorphisms. Many of the polymorphisms were also
present in the homologous loci on chromosome 16, supporting the idea
that they may serve as a reservoir for genetic variability in the PKD1
gene. To their surprise, Watnick et al. (1999) found that 3
independently ascertained pedigrees had an identical 2-bp deletion in
exon 15 (601313.0014).

Rossetti et al. (2001) developed methods to amplify all of the PKD1
coding area and screened for mutations in 131 unrelated patients with
ADPKD, using the protein-truncation test and direct sequencing.
Mutations were identified in 57 families, and, including 24 previously
characterized changes from this cohort, a detection rate of 52.3% was
achieved in 155 families. Mutations were distributed through all areas
of the gene, from exon 1 to exon 46, with no clear hotspot identified.
There was no significant difference in mutation frequency between the
single-copy and duplicated areas of the gene, but mutations were more
than twice as frequent in the 3-prime half of the gene, compared with
the 5-prime half. Most mutations were predicted to truncate the protein
through nonsense mutations (32%), insertions or deletions (29.6%), or
splicing changes (6.2%), although the figures were biased by the methods
employed, and, in sequenced areas, approximately 50% of all mutations
were missense or in-frame. Other studies had suggested that gene
conversion may be a significant cause of mutation in PKD1, but only 3 of
69 different mutations matched the PKD1-like HG sequence. A relatively
high rate of new PKD1 mutations was calculated, 1.8 x 10(-5) mutations
per generation, consistent with the many different mutations identified
(69 in 81 pedigrees) and suggesting significant selection against mutant
alleles. In this study, the mutation detection rate of more than 50% was
comparable to that achieved for other large multiexon genes and showed
the feasibility of DNA diagnosis in this disorder.

Perrichot et al. (1999) used denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis
(DGGE) to scan for mutations in the nonduplicated region of the PKD1
gene in a large cohort of 146 French unrelated ADPKD patients. They
identified several novel mutations: 3 frameshift mutations, 2 nonsense
mutations, 2 missense mutations, 1 insertion in a frame of 9
nucleotides, 3 intronic variations, and several polymorphisms. One of
these mutations, W4139X (601313.0015), was said by Perrichot et al.
(1999) to be the fourth reported de novo mutation in the PKD1 gene.
Anticipation was suspected in 1 family in which the diagnosis was made
in utero in a member of the most recent generation. This study was
undertaken in patients in Brittany, a Celtic area in the western part of
France. A previous epidemiologic study in Brittany by Simon et al.
(1996) found the frequency of the disease to be close to 1 in 1,100.

Koptides et al. (2000) provided the first direct genetic evidence that
polycystins 1 and 2 interact, perhaps as part of a larger complex. In
cystic DNA from a kidney of a patient with autosomal dominant PKD1, the
authors showed somatic mutations not only in the PKD1 gene of certain
cysts, but also in the PKD2 gene of others, generating a
transheterozygous state with mutations in both genes. The mutation in
the PKD1 gene was of germinal nature and the mutation in the PKD2 gene
was of somatic nature. The authors stated that to their knowledge this
was the first demonstration of the transheterozygous model as a
mechanism for human disease development. In Drosophila melanogaster, a
transheterozygous situation for 2 recessive mutations, the multiple wing
hair and flare-3, has been exploited by Delgado-Rodriguez et al. (1999)
for developing the wing spot test, which identifies genotoxic
substances.

Koptides and Deltas (2000) reviewed the molecular genetics and molecular
pathogenesis of ADPKD. They reviewed data that support or possibly
contradict the 2-hit hypothesis, and other data that support the
transheterozygous model for cystogenesis.

Using exon-by-exon SSCP analysis on long-range PCR products, Bouba et
al. (2001) performed a systematic screening of part of the duplicated
region of the PKD1 gene in a cohort of 53 Hellenic ADPKD families from
Greece and Cyprus. The region screened (exons 16-34) represented 23% of
the PKD1 coding sequence, and 8 probable disease mutations were
identified: 5 deletions and 3 missense mutations. In one family, a 3-bp
and an 8-bp deletion in exons 20 and 21, respectively, were coinherited
on the same PKD1 chromosome, causing disease in the mother and 3 sons.
Eleven intragenic polymorphisms were also detected, representing neutral
or coding variants, confirming previous suggestions that the PKD1 gene
is prone to mutations.

Pei et al. (2001) reported studies of an extensively affected
Newfoundland family in which it appeared that there was bilineal
polycystic kidney disease from independently segregating PKD1 and PKD2
mutations. Affected members who were heterozygous for mutations in both
the PKD1 and PKD2 genes (transheterozygotes) had a more severe clinical
course than those with mutations in only 1 of the genes.

In 17 unrelated Australian individuals with PKD1-linked autosomal
dominant PKD, McCluskey et al. (2002) screened for disease-causing
mutations in the duplicated region of the PKD1 gene. They identified 12
novel probably pathogenic DNA variants. Defects in the duplicated region
of the gene accounted for 63% of the patients. Together with the
previously detected mutations in the 3-prime region of the gene, the
study achieved an overall mutation detection rate of 74%. They also
detected 31 variants (9 novel and 22 previously published) that did not
segregate with the disease and were considered to be polymorphisms.
Three of the 9 novel polymorphisms were missense mutations with a
predicted effect on protein conformation, emphasizing the problems of
interpretation in PKD1 mutation screening.

Inoue et al. (2002) examined PKD1 mutations in Japanese ADPKD patients.
Six novel chain-terminating mutations were detected. They concluded that
most PKD1 mutations in Japanese ADPKD patients are novel and definitely
pathogenic. One pedigree did not link to either PKD1 or PKD2.

Eo et al. (2002) described 3 novel mutations of the PKD1 gene in Korean
patients. In this study, the clinical data from affected individuals and
from previously reported Korean PKD1 mutations showed that patients with
frameshift or nonsense mutations were more prone to develop end-stage
renal failure than those with missense mutations.

Familial clustering of intracranial aneurysms suggests that genetic
factors are important in the etiology of ADPKD. Rossetti et al. (2003)
characterized mutations in 58 ADPKD families with vascular
complications; 51 were PKD1 (88%) and 7 were PKD2 (12%). The median
position of the PKD1 mutation was significantly further 5-prime in the
vascular population than in the 87 control pedigrees (amino acid
position 2163 vs 2773, p = 0.0034). Subsets of the vascular population
with aneurysmal rupture, early rupture, or families with more than 1
vascular case had median mutation locations even further 5-prime.

Gout et al. (2007) retrospectively reviewed published variants in the
PKD1 genes and detected errors in 39 of 771 variants (5.06%). All arose
from human processing mistakes. As peer-reviewed publication is no
safeguard for those considering the clinical significance of an unknown
variant, the authors suggested that reporting of new variants for the
proposed Human Variome Project should employ both automated reporting
and expert scrutiny. Errors were grouped into 3 categories:
misassignment, miscounting, and typographical. A table of erroneous
variant reports with corrections was published.

ANIMAL MODEL

Himmelbauer et al. (1991, 1992) mapped 2 human cDNA clones, derived from
the region between markers flanking PKD1, in the mouse genome. From the
study of recombinant inbred strains and of somatic cell hybrids, they
found that the PKD1 region markers mapped to mouse chromosome 17.

Aziz et al. (1993, 1994) demonstrated that the mouse Ke6 gene (601417)
is involved in the manifestation of polycystic kidney disease in 2
different murine models of PKD. The HKE4 (601416) and HKE6 genes are
located in the major histocompatibility complex in mouse and human, on
mouse chromosome 17 and human chromosome 6, respectively.

Olsson et al. (1996) mapped the Pkd1 locus to mouse chromosome 17 using
somatic cell hybrids, B x D recombinant inbred strains, and fluorescence
in situ hybridization. The gene is located within a previously defined
conserved synteny group that includes the mouse homolog of tuberous
sclerosis-2 (TSC2; 191092) and is linked to the alpha-globin pseudogene.
Like their human counterparts, the mouse Tsc2 and Pkd1 genes are
arranged in a tail-to-tail orientation with a distance of only 63 bp
between the polyadenylation signals of the 2 genes.

Lohning et al. (1997) studied the mouse version of the PKD1 gene. The
predicted protein is 79% identical to human PKD1 and contains most of
the domains identified in the human sequence. As in the human, the mouse
homolog is transcribed from a unique gene and there are no transcribed,
closely related copies. At the junction of exons 12 and 13, several
different splicing variants were identified that lead to a predicted
protein that could be secreted. These forms were found predominantly in
newborn brain, while in kidney the transcript homologous to the
previously described human RNA predominated.

Lu et al. (1997) introduced into mice by homologous recombination a Pkd1
truncation mutation that mimicked a mutation found in human ADPKD.
Heterozygotes had no discernible phenotype, whereas homozygotes died
during the perinatal period with massively enlarged cystic kidneys,
pancreatic ductal cysts, and pulmonary hypoplasia. Renal cyst formation
began at embryonic day 15.5 in proximal tubules and progressed rapidly
to replace the entire renal parenchyma. The timing of cyst formation
suggested that full-length polycystin is required for normal
morphogenesis during elongation and maturation of tubular structures in
the kidney and pancreas. Hepatic and pancreatic cysts are rather common
in ADPKD (Gabow, 1993), but are rarely of clinical significance. The
pulmonary hypoplasia that occurred in the mice and is found in
polycystic disease in childhood probably results from oligohydramnios
and abdominal distention produced by renal enlargement. Although liver
cysts occur in about 30% of patients with ADPKD, surprisingly none were
observed in the homozygous mutant mice. There were also no abnormalities
in tissues such as myocardium and vascular smooth muscle in which
polycystin is normally expressed. These findings suggested that vascular
abnormalities such as aneurysm may be secondary phenomena, and indeed
these have been commonly attributed to the occurrence of hypertension.
However, Kim et al. (2000) demonstrated a primary role of PKD1 mutations
in vascular fragility. They found that mouse embryos homozygous for a
mutant allele, generated by knockout, exhibited subcutaneous edema,
vascular leaks, and rupture of blood vessels, culminating in lethality
at embryonic day 15.5. Kidney and pancreatic ductal cysts were present.
They detected mouse polycystin-1 in normal endothelium and the
surrounding vascular smooth muscle cells. These data revealed a
requisite role for polycystin-1 in maintaining the structural integrity
of the vasculature as well as epithelium and suggested that the nature
of the PKD1 mutation contributes to the phenotypic variance in ADPKD.

Pritchard et al. (2000) generated transgenic mice with approximately 30
copies of a 108-kb human genomic fragment containing the entire
autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease gene, PKD1. Two such cell
lines produced full-length PKD1 mRNA and polycystin-1 protein that was
developmentally regulated, similar to the endogenous pattern, with
expression during renal embryogenesis and neonatal life that was
markedly reduced at the conclusion of renal development. Transgenic
animals from both lines often displayed multiple renal microcysts,
mainly of glomerular origin. Hepatic cysts and bile duct proliferation,
characteristic of ADPKD, were also seen. To test the functionality of
the transgene, animals were bred with the Pkd1del34 knockout mouse (Lu
et al., 1997). Both transgenic lines rescued the embryonically lethal
Pkd1del34/del34 phenotype, demonstrating that human polycystin-1 can
compensate for loss of the endogenous protein. The rescued animals were
viable into adulthood, although more than half developed hepatic cystic
disease in later life, similar to the phenotype of older Pkd1del34/+
animals. The authors hypothesized that overexpression of normal PKD1 can
elicit a disease phenotype, suggesting that the level of polycystin-1
expression may be relevant in the human disease.

Kleymenova et al. (2001) found that rats with a germline inactivation of
1 allele of the Tsc2 tumor suppressor gene developed early-onset severe
bilateral polycystic kidney disease, with similarities to the human
contiguous gene syndrome caused by germline codeletion of the PKD1 and
TSC2 genes. Polycystic rat renal cells retained 2 normal Pkd1 alleles
but were null for Tsc2 and exhibited loss of lateral membrane-localized
polycystin-1. In tuberin-deficient cells, intracellular trafficking of
polycystin-1 was disrupted, resulting in sequestration of polycystin-1
within the Golgi, and reexpression of Tsc2 restored correct polycystin-1
membrane localization. These data identified tuberin as a determinant of
polycystin-1 functional localization and, potentially, autosomal
dominant polycystic kidney disease severity.

Boulter et al. (2001) described mice carrying a targeted mutation in the
Pkd1 gene, which defined its expression pattern by using a lacZ reporter
gene. Although heterozygous adult mice developed renal and hepatic
cysts, homozygous embryos died at embryonic days 13.5 to 14.5 from a
primary cardiovascular defect that included double outflow right
ventricle, disorganized myocardium, and abnormal atrioventricular
septation. Skeletal development was also severely compromised. These
abnormalities correlated with the major sites of Pkd1 expression. During
nephrogenesis, Pkd1 was expressed in maturing tubular epithelial cells
from embryonic day 15.5. This expression coincided with the onset of
cyst formation in transgenic mice for mutations either in Pkd1 or Pkd2,
supporting the hypothesis that polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 interact in
vivo and that their failure to do so leads to abnormalities in tubule
morphology and function.

Lu et al. (2001) reported the generation of a targeted mouse mutant with
a null mutation in Pkd1 and its phenotypic characterization in
comparison with the del34 mutants that carry a truncation mutation in
Pkd1. Null homozygotes develop more aggressive renal and pancreatic
cystic disease than del34/del34. Moreover, both homozygous mutants
developed polyhydramnios, hydrops fetalis, spina bifida occulta, and
osteochondrodysplasia. Heterozygotes also develop adult-onset pancreatic
disease. The del34 homozygotes continue to produce mutant polycystin-1,
thereby providing a possible explanation for increased immunoreactive
polycystin-1 in ADPKD cyst epithelia in the context of the 2-hit model.
The authors concluded that loss of polycystin-1 leads to cyst formation
and defective skeletogenesis, and polycystin-1 may be critical in both
epithelium and chondrocyte development.

To study molecular defects in Pkd1 mutants, Muto et al. (2002) generated
a mouse with a targeted deletion of exons 2 to 6 of Pkd1. Homozygous
embryos (Pkd1 -/-) developed hydrops, cardiac conotruncal defects, and
renal cystogenesis. Total protein levels of beta-catenin in heart and
kidney and c-myc (190080) in heart were decreased in Pkd1 -/- embryos.
In the kidneys of Pkd1 -/-, the expression of E-cadherin and Pecam1
(173445) in basolateral membranes of renal tubules was attenuated, and
tyrosine phosphorylation of Egfr (131550) and Gab1 (604439) were
constitutively enhanced when cystogenesis started on embryonic day 15.5
to 16.5. Maternally administered pioglitazone, a thiazolidinedione
compound, resolved these molecular defects of Pkd1 -/-. Treatment with
pioglitazone improved survival of Pkd1 -/- embryos and ameliorated the
cardiac defects and the degree of renal cystogenesis. Long-term
treatment with pioglitazone improved the endothelial function of adult
Pkd1 +/-. The authors concluded that molecular defects observed in Pkd1
-/- embryos contributed to the pathogenesis of ADPKD, and that
thiazolidinediones had a compensatory effect on the pathway affected by
the loss of polycystin-1.

Wu et al. (2002) investigated the role of trans-heterozygous mutations
in mouse models of polycystic kidney disease. In Pkd1 +/-, Pkd2 +/-, and
Pkd1 +/-: Pkd2 +/- mice, the renal cystic lesion was mild and variable
with no adverse effect on survival at 1 year. In keeping with the 2-hit
mechanism of cyst formation, approximately 70% of kidney cysts in Pkd2
+/- mice exhibited uniform loss of polycystin-2 expression. Cystic
disease in trans-heterozygous Pkd1 +/-: Pkd2 +/- mice, however, was
notable for severity in excess of that predicted by a simple additive
effect based on cyst formation in singly heterozygous mice. These data
suggested a modifier role for the 'trans' polycystin gene in cystic
kidney disease, and suggested a contribution from threshold effects to
cyst formation and growth.

Lantinga-van Leeuwen et al. (2004) generated mice carrying a hypomorphic
Pkd1 allele (Pkd1nl), which yielded only 13 to 20% normally spliced Pkd1
transcripts in homozygous mice. Homozygous Pkd1nl mice were viable,
showing bilaterally enlarged polycystic kidneys. In addition, homozygous
Pkd1nl mice showed dilatations of pancreatic and liver bile ducts as
well as cardiovascular abnormalities, pathogenic features similar to the
human ADPKD phenotype. The authors concluded that a reduced dosage of
Pkd1 is sufficient to initiate cystogenesis and vascular defects, and
that low Pkd1 gene expression levels can overcome the embryonic
lethality seen in Pkd1-knockout mice. Lantinga-van Leeuwen et al. (2004)
hypothesized that in patients, reduced PKD1 expression of the normal
allele below a critical level, due to genetic, environmental, or
stochastic factors, may lead to cyst formation in the kidneys and other
clinical features of ADPKD.

The homolog of the human PKD1 gene maps to feline chromosome E3. Young
et al. (2005) demonstrated that the feline polycystic kidney disease
maps to this region.

Piontek et al. (2007) found that inactivation of the Pkd1 gene in mice
before postnatal day 13 resulted in severely cystic kidneys within 3
weeks, whereas inactivation at day 14 or later resulted in cysts only
after 5 months. In both cases, the cysts originated from all tubular
segments. The abrupt change in response to Pkd1 inactivation
corresponded to a brake point in renal growth and significant changes in
gene expression. Piontek et al. (2007) concluded that the pathologic
consequences of PKD1 inactivation are defined by a developmental switch
that signals terminal renal maturation.

Patients with tuberous sclerosis often develop renal cysts and those
with inherited codeletions of PKD1 gene develop severe, early-onset
polycystic kidneys. Using mouse models, Bonnet et al. (2009) showed that
many of the earliest lesions from Tsc1 (605284) +/-, Tsc2 +/-, and Pkd1
+/- mice did not exhibit activation of mTOR, confirming an
mTOR-independent pathway of renal cystogenesis. Using Tsc1/Pkd1 and
Tsc2/Pkd1 heterozygous double-mutants, the authors showed functional
cooperation and an effect on renal primary cilium length between
hamartin and tuberin with polycystin-1. The Tsc1, Tsc2, and Pkd1 gene
products helped regulate primary cilia length in renal tubules, renal
epithelial cells, and precystic hepatic cholangiocytes. Consistent with
the function of cilia in modulating cell polarity, Bonnet et al. (2009)
found that many dividing precystic renal tubule and hepatic bile duct
cells from Tsc1, Tsc2, and Pkd1 heterozygous mice were highly
misoriented. Bonnet et al. (2009) proposed that defects in cell polarity
may underlie cystic disease associated with TSC1, TSC2, and PKD1, and
that targeting of this pathway may be of key therapeutic benefit.

Takakura et al. (2009) showed that renal injury led to massive cystic
disease in a mouse model of adult inactivation of Pkd1 using the
Mx1Cre(+) allele. Cysts were labeled with a collecting duct/tubule
marker Dolichos biflorus agglutinin, which correlated with the site of
Cre-mediated recombination in the collecting system. BrdU labeling
revealed that cyst-lining epithelial cells were comprised of regenerated
cells in response to renal injury. Takakura et al. (2009) proposed a
role for polycystin-1 in kidney injury and repair and suggested that
renal injury may constitute a 'third hit' resulting in rapid cyst
formation in adulthood.

Kurbegovic et al. (2010) generated 3 transgenic mouse lines from a
Pkd1-BAC modified by introducing a silent tag via homologous
recombination to target a sustained wildtype genomic Pkd1 expression
within the native tissue and temporal regulation. The mice specifically
overexpressed the Pkd1 transgene in extrarenal and renal tissues from 2-
to 15-fold over Pkd1 endogenous levels in a copy-dependent manner. All
transgenic mice reproducibly developed tubular and glomerular cysts
leading to renal insufficiency. Pkd1(TAG) mice also exhibited renal
fibrosis and calcium deposits in papilla reminiscent of nephrolithiasis,
as is frequently observed in ADPKD. Similar to human ADPKD, these mice
consistently displayed hepatic fibrosis and approximately 15%
intrahepatic cysts of the bile ducts, affecting females preferentially.
A significant proportion of mice developed cardiac anomalies with severe
left ventricular hypertrophy, marked aortic arch distention, and/or
valvular stenosis and calcification that had profound functional impact.
Pkd1(TAG) mice displayed occasional cerebral lesions with evidence of
ruptured and unruptured cerebral aneurysms.

Using a combination of targeted knockout and overexpression with 2 genes
mutated in polycystic liver disease (PCLD; 174050), Prkcsh (177060) and
Sec63 (608648), and 3 genes mutated in polycystic kidney disease, Pkd1,
Pkd2, and Pkhd1, Fedeles et al. (2011) produced a spectrum of cystic
disease severity in mice. Cyst formation in all combinations of these
genes, except complete loss of Pkd2, was significantly modulated by
altering expression of Pkd1. Proteasome inhibition increased the
steady-state levels of Pkd1 in cells lacking Prkcsh and reduced cystic
disease in mouse models of autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease.
Fedeles et al. (2011) concluded that PRKCSH, SEC63, PKD1, PKD2, and
PKHD1 form an interaction network with PKD1 as the rate-limiting
component.

HISTORY

Chanmugam et al. (1971) reported a family that might suggest linkage of
hereditary spherocytosis (see 182900) and polycystic kidney disease. A
father and 3 children had both diseases. Three other children and 4 sibs
of the father were thought to be free of both diseases. There is,
however, no other suggestion of location of a spherocytosis locus on
chromosome 16, or chromosome 4 (cf. 173910), where genes for adult
polycystic kidney disease have been mapped.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE 1
PKD1, IVSDS, G-C, +1

In probands with polycystic kidney disease-1 (PKD1; 173900), the
European Polycystic Kidney Disease Consortium (1994) found 4 mutations
in the PKD1 gene, including a G-to-C transition at position +1 of the
splice donor site following the 135-bp exon and resulting in an in-frame
deletion of basepairs 3696-3831. The proband was from a large family in
which the disease could be traced through 3 generations. In a parent and
2 affected sibs, the abnormal transcript segregated with PKD1.

.0002
POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE 1
PKD1, GLN1273TER

Turco et al. (1995) used PCR with primer pairs located in the 3-prime
unique region of the PKD1 gene and heteroduplex DNA analysis in 20
unrelated ADPKD probands from northern Italy, all of whom were members
of families in which previous studies had indicated linkage to PKD1
(173900). In 5 affected individuals from the same family, they found
novel aberrant bands that were absent in 13 unaffected family members.
Cloning and automated DNA sequencing revealed a C-to-T transition at
nucleotide 3817 of the published cDNA sequence, which created a
premature stop codon. The mutation changed a CAG codon for glutamine to
a TAG amber stop codon (Q1273X). The mutation destroyed an MspA1I
restriction site, and the abnormal restriction pattern was observed on
genomic DNA from all the affected family members. RT-PCR and restriction
analysis performed on peripheral white blood cell mRNA showed that in
the affected members both the mutant and the normal transcript were
represented. The mutation was not found in the probands of the other
families studied. This appears to have been the first nonsense mutation
described in the PKD1 gene.

.0003
POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE 1
PKD1, 15-BP DEL

Among the 6 novel mutations in families with PKD1 (173900) that Peral et
al. (1996) added to the 7 previously described ones was an in-frame
15-bp deletion which removed 5 amino acids, RQVRL, between amino acids
3747 and 3753. The deletion was probably promoted by misalignment of 2
directly repeated 7-bp sequences. The repeated sequences meant that the
precise region deleted could not be determined.

.0004
POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE 1
PKD1, ARG4227TER

Peral et al. (1996) found an abnormal fragment by SSCP analysis of the
PKD1 gene in a patient with polycystic kidney disease (173900). Direct
sequencing revealed a C-to-T transition changing the arg4227 codon, CGA,
to a stop codon, TGA, and giving rise to a predicted truncated protein
76 amino acids shorter than the normal protein. The same abnormality was
found in 2 affected relatives.

.0005
POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE 1
PKD1, GLN3837TER

Peral et al. (1996) used SSCP analysis followed by direct sequencing in
a patient with polycystic kidney disease (173900) revealed a
gln3837-to-ter (CAG-to-TAG, Q3837X) mutation in the PKD1 gene. The
mutation abolished a PvuII restriction site and this was used to confirm
the mutation in 2 other affected relatives.

.0006
POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE 1
PKD1, CYS4086TER

In a large Cypriot family with PKD1 (173900), Neophytou et al. (1996)
identified a T-to-A nucleotide substitution at position 12258 in the
3-prime region of polycystin that led to a cys4086-to-ter mutation
(C4086X). The premature stop codon is expected to remove 217 amino acids
from the C-terminal intracellular domain of the gene product.

.0007
POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE 1
PKD1, TYR3818TER

Peral et al. (1996) described a tyr3818-to-ter (Y3818X) mutation in the
PKD1 gene in a severely affected child with polycystic kidney disease
(173900). They found the same mutation in her clinically normal twin
brother and in her father who had typical adult-onset disease. Because
the same stable mutation was associated with very different disease
severity in this family, Peral et al. (1996) proposed that a small
number of modifying factors may radically affect the course of type 1
polycystic kidney disease.

.0008
POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE 1
PKD1, 12036G-A

In individuals of Dutch origin with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney
disease (173900), Roelfsema et al. (1997) used the protein truncation
test (PTT) to detect mutations in the PKD1 gene. Since the PTT detects
only translation-terminating mutations, all mutations that they found
were either base substitutions leading to a stop codon or frameshifts.
In 4 cases there were small deletions leading to frameshifts; base
substitutions were found in 3 individuals. One of these was a G-to-A
transition of nucleotide 12036 in exon 44. The transition created a new
Sau3AI restriction site and eliminated an AvaII site.

.0009
POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE 1
PKD1, 28-BP DEL, NT6434

Using long-range PCR and direct sequence analysis in a group of 24
unrelated patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease
(173900), Thomas et al. (1999) identified 7 novel mutations in the PKD1
gene, one of which was a 28-bp deletion involving nucleotides 6434-6461
in exon 15.

.0010
POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE 1
PKD1, IVS14, G-A, -1

One of 7 unique mutations identified by Thomas et al. (1999) in patients
with PKD1 (173900) was a splice mutation, a G-to-A transition at
position -1 in the acceptor site in intron 14.

.0011
POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE 1
PKD1, ARG324LEU

One of 7 unique mutations identified by Thomas et al. (1999) by
long-range PCR and direct sequencing of the PKD1 gene in patients with
polycystic kidney disease (173900) was an arg324-to-leu (R324L) mutation
in exon 5.

.0012
POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE 1
PKD1, LEU845SER

One of 7 unique mutations identified by Thomas et al. (1999) by
long-range PCR and direct sequencing of the PKD1 gene in patients with
polycystic kidney disease (173900) was a leu845-to-ser (L845S) mutation
in exon 11.

.0013
POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE 1
PKD1, GLN1922TER

One of 7 unique mutations identified by Thomas et al. (1999) by
long-range PCR and direct sequencing of the PKD1 gene in patients with
polycystic kidney disease (173900) was a nonsense mutation, gln1922 to
ter (Q1922X), in exon 15.

.0014
POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE 1, SEVERE
PKD1, 2-BP DEL, 5224AG

In 3 of 35 independently ascertained pedigrees with polycystic kidney
disease (173900) selected for study because they included individuals
with either intracranial aneurysms and/or very early-onset disease,
Watnick et al. (1999) identified an identical 2-bp deletion (AG) at
nucleotide 5224 in exon 15 of the PKD1 gene. One family contained an
individual with a cerebral aneurysm. A second family was evaluated
because a child had very early-onset disease; the affected father had
the same mutation as the daughter. The third family had at least 3
individuals with aneurysms, including 1 with very early onset. There
were 2 additional individuals in this family (both cousins of the
individual with both early onset-disease and aneurysm) who had very
early-onset disease but from whom DNA samples were not available.
Although each of these 3 families had individuals who were severely
affected, there were also individuals with renal cystic disease and a
more routine presentation.

.0015
POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE 1, SEVERE
PKD1, TRP4139TER

In a 25-year-old French patient with APKD (173900), Perrichot et al.
(1999) identified what they claimed to be the fourth reported de novo
mutation in the PKD1 gene: a 12628G-A transition in exon 45 leading to a
trp4139-to-ter (W4139X) mutation.

.0016
POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE 1
PKD1, GLY2579DEL, 8-BP DEL

In a family with ADPKD (173900), Bouba et al. (2001) identified 2
deletions in the PKD1 gene: a 3-bp deletion in exon 20 and an 8-bp
deletion in exon 21. The deletions were coinherited on the same
chromosome, causing disease in the mother and 3 sons. The 3-bp mutation
corresponded to glycine at codon 2579. The 8-bp deletion was predicted
to result in a translation frameshift after amino acid 2657, leading to
a stop codon 483 bp downstream. Cloning and sequencing experiments
showed that the 2 deletions were in cis position on the chromosome that
was inherited from the affected mother.

600277	TITLE *600277 INHIBITOR OF DNA BINDING 3; ID3
;;HEIR1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the ID family of helix-loop-helix (HLH) proteins lack a basic
DNA-binding domain and inhibit transcription through formation of
nonfunctional dimers that are incapable of binding to DNA.

CLONING

Ellmeier et al. (1992) isolated a novel human gene encoding a
helix-loop-helix protein by molecular cloning of chromosome
1p36-specific CpG islands. Initially termed HEIR1, the ID3 gene was
localized to the neuroblastoma consensus deletion region, 1p36.2-p36.12.
Its predicted protein was 95.8% identical to the mouse HLH462 protein
and had clear homology to the mouse Id and Drosophila emc proteins. The
gene was expressed at high abundance in adult lung, kidney, and adrenal
medulla, but not in adult brain. Despite prominent HEIR1 expression in
adrenal medulla, which is a prime target for neuroblastomas, 10 of 12
neuroblastoma-derived cell lines showed very low levels of HEIR1 mRNA.
Low HEIR1 expression was generally found in tumor cell lines with NMYC
(164840) overexpression, whereas the 2 cell lines displaying high HEIR1
levels did not overexpress NMYC. Mutually exclusive expression of the 2
genes was also found by in situ hybridization in developing mouse
tissues, particularly in the forebrain neuroectoderm. Ellmeier et al.
(1992) concluded that HEIR1 expression is reduced specifically in the
majority of neuroblastomas and suggested an inverse correlation between
HEIR1 and NMYC expression in these tumors and in embryonic development.

GENE FUNCTION

ID3 is an inhibitor of E proteins, such as E2A (147141). By Northern and
Western blot analysis, Kee et al. (2001) showed that transforming growth
factor-beta (190180) in mouse rapidly induced transient Id3 expression
in B-lymphocyte precursors. This induction involved activation of the
SMAD (see 602932) transcription factor pathway.

Kaplan et al. (2005) demonstrated that bone marrow-derived hematopoietic
progenitor cells that express VEGFR1 (605070) home to tumor-specific
premetastatic sites and form cellular clusters before the arrival of
tumor cells. Preventing VEGFR1 function using antibodies or by the
removal of VEGFR1-positive cells from the bone marrow of wildtype mice
abrogated the formation of these premetastatic clusters and prevented
tumor metastasis, whereas reconstitution with selected Id3-competent
VEGFR1-positive cells established cluster formation and tumor metastasis
in Id3 knockout mice. Kaplan et al. (2005) also showed that
VEGFR1-positive cells express VLA4, also known as integrin
alpha-4-beta-1 (see 192975), and that tumor-specific growth factors
upregulate fibronectin (135600), a VLA4 ligand, in resident fibroblasts,
providing a permissive niche for incoming tumor cells. Conditioned media
obtained from distinct tumor types with unique patterns of metastatic
spread redirected fibronectin expression and cluster formation, thereby
transforming the metastatic profile. Kaplan et al. (2005) concluded that
their findings demonstrated a requirement for VEGFR1-positive
hematopoietic progenitors in the regulation of metastasis, and suggest
that expression patterns of fibronectin and
VEGFR1-positive-VLA4-positive clusters dictate organ-specific tumor
spread.

GENE STRUCTURE

Deed et al. (1994) reported a comparison of the ID3 gene with ID1
(600349) and ID2 (600386) that showed a highly conserved protein-coding
gene organization consistent with evolution from a common ancestral
gene.

Yeh and Lim (2000) determined that both the human and mouse genes
contain 3 exons spanning about 1.5 kb.

MAPPING

By using a YAC clone of ID3 for fluorescence in situ hybridization, Deed
et al. (1994) mapped the ID3 gene to 1p36.1.

White et al. (1995) excluded ID3 as a candidate for the neuroblastoma
suppressor gene because it lies outside the loss of heterozygosity
region revealed by neuroblastoma studies (see 256700).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using whole-genome, whole-exome, and transcriptome sequencing of 4
prototypical Burkitt lymphomas (113970) with immunoglobulin gene (IG;
see 147220)-MYC translocation (190080), Richter et al. (2012) identified
7 recurrently mutated genes. One of these genes, ID3, mapped to a region
of focal homozygous loss in Burkitt lymphoma. In an extended cohort, 36
of 53 molecularly defined Burkitt lymphomas (68%) carried potentially
damaging mutations of ID3. These were strongly enriched at somatic
hypermutation motifs. Only 6 of 47 other B-cell lymphomas with the
IG-MYC translocation (13%) carried ID3 mutations. Richter et al. (2012)
concluded that their findings suggested that cooperation between ID3
inactivation and IG-MYC translocation is a hallmark of Burkitt
lymphomagenesis.

Love et al. (2012) described the first completely sequenced genome from
a Burkitt lymphoma tumor and germline DNA from the same affected
individual, and further sequenced the exomes of 59 Burkitt lymphoma
tumors and compared them to sequenced exomes from 94 diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma tumors. Love et al. (2012) identified 70 genes that were
recurrently mutated in Burkitt lymphomas, including ID3, GNA13 (604406),
RET (164761), PIK3R1 (171833), and the SWI/SNF genes ARID1A (603024) and
SMARCA4 (603254). Love et al. (2012) stated that their data implicate a
number of genes in cancer for the first time, including CCT6B (610730),
SALL3 (605079), FTCD (606806), and PC (608786). ID3 mutations occurred
in 34% of Burkitt lymphomas and not in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas
(DLBCLs). Love et al. (2012) showed experimentally that ID3 mutations
promote cell cycle progression and proliferation.

ANIMAL MODEL

Id proteins may control cell differentiation by interfering with DNA
binding of transcription factors. Lyden et al. (1999) demonstrated that
the targeted disruption of Id1 (600349) and Id3 in mice results in
premature withdrawal of neuroblasts in the cell cycle and expression of
neural-specific differentiation markers. Lyden et al. (1999) crossed Id1
+/- and Id3 +/- mice. Offspring lacking 1 to 3 Id alleles in any
combination were indistinguishable from wildtype, but no animals lacking
all 4 Id alleles were born. The Id1-Id3 double knockout mice displayed
vascular malformations in forebrain and absence of branching and
sprouting of blood vessels in the neuroectoderm. As angiogenesis both in
the brain and in tumors requires invasion of avascular tissue by
endothelial cells, Lyden et al. (1999) examined Id knockout mice for
their ability to support the growth of tumor xenografts. Three different
tumors failed to grow and/or metastasize in Id1 +/- Id3 -/- mice, and
any tumor growth present showed poor vascularization and extensive
necrosis. Lyden et al. (1999) concluded that Id genes are required to
maintain the timing of neuronal differentiation in the embryo and
invasiveness of the vasculature. Because the Id genes are expressed at
very low levels in adults, they make attractive targets for
antiangiogenic drug design. Lyden et al. (1999) also concluded that the
premature neuronal differentiation in Id1-Id3 double knockout mice
indicates that ID1 or ID3 is required to block the precisely timed
expression and activation of positively acting bHLH proteins during
murine development.

Pan et al. (1999) found that Id3-deficient mice had no overt
abnormalities but had compromised humoral immunity. After immunization
with T cell-dependent or T cell-independent antigens, the responses of
Id3-deficient mice were attenuated and severely impaired, respectively.
T-cell proliferative responses appeared to be intact, but IFNG
expression may have been impaired. The defect in B-cell proliferation
could be rescued by ectopic expression of Id1.

In the developing heart, Id1, Id2 (600386), and Id3 are detected in the
endocardial cushion mesenchyme from embryonic days 10.5 through 16.5,
but Id4 (600581) is absent. Fraidenraich et al. (2004) showed that Id1
to Id3 are also expressed in the epicardium and endocardium but are
absent in the myocardium. Id1 to Id3 expression becomes confined in the
leaflets of the cardiac valves as the atrioventricular endocardial
cushion tissue myocardializes. Id1 and Id3 expression persists in the
cardiac valves, endocardium, endothelium, and epicardium at postnatal
day 7. Fraidenraich et al. (2004) found that double and triple Id
knockout embryos displayed severe cardiac defects and died at
midgestation. Embryo size was reduced by 10 to 30%. Knockout embryos
displayed ventricular septal defects associated with impaired
ventricular trabeculation and thinning of the compact myocardium.
Trabeculae had disorganized sheets of myocytes surrounded by
discontinuous endocardial cell lining. Cell proliferation in the
myocardial wall was defective. Fraidenraich et al. (2004) showed that
midgestation lethality of embryos was rescued by the injection of 15
wildtype embryonic stem (ES) cells into mutant blastocysts. Myocardial
markers altered in Id mutant cells were restored to normal throughout
the chimeric myocardium. Intraperitoneal injection of ES cells into
female mice before conception also partially rescued the cardiac
phenotype with no incorporation of ES cells. Insulin-like growth
factor-1 (IGF1; 147440), a long-range secreted factor, in combination
with Wnt5a (164975), a locally secreted factor, were thought likely to
account for complete reversion of the cardiac phenotype. Fraidenraich et
al. (2004) concluded that ES cells have the potential to reverse
congenital defects through Id-dependent local and long-range effects in
a mammalian embryo.

Li et al. (2004) observed that Id3 -/- mice had difficulty maintaining
fully opened eyelids beginning at 6 months and progressing with age.
Histologic and electron microscopic analysis of mutant mice revealed
lymphocytic infiltration in the lachrymal and salivary glands in the
absence of infection, and the CD4 (186940) and CD8 (see 186910) T cells
and B cells in the infiltrates expressed both Ifng (147570) and Il4
(147780). Id3 -/- mice showed reduced tear and saliva secretion,
suggesting a disease similar to Sjogren syndrome (270150). ELISA
analysis detected both anti-SSA (SSA1; 109092) and anti-SSB (109090)
autoantibodies in Id3 -/- mice after 1 year of age. Bone marrow
transplant experiments showed that the phenotype was mediated by
hemopoietic cells, and adoptive transfer analysis attributed a dominant
role to Id3 -/- T lymphocytes. Elimination of T cells and neonatal
thymectomy demonstrated that the tear and saliva secretion defect
required sustained production of thymic T cells. Li et al. (2004)
concluded that ID3-mediated T-cell development is connected to
autoimmune disease, and they proposed that the Id3 -/- mouse is a model
for primary Sjogren syndrome.

606741	TITLE *606741 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 181; ZNF181
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Zinc finger proteins have been shown to interact with nucleic acids and
to have diverse functions. The zinc finger domain is a conserved amino
acid sequence motif containing 2 specifically positioned cysteines and 2
histidines that are involved in coordinating zinc. Kruppel-related
proteins form 1 family of zinc finger proteins. See 604749 for
additional information on zinc finger proteins.

CLONING

By screening a human fetal heart cDNA library with a degenerate
oligonucleotide based on the consensus sequence of the C2H2 zinc finger
domain, Wang et al. (1996) cloned 2 novel zinc finger cDNAs, designated
ZNF180 (606740) and ZNF181.

MAPPING

By FISH, Wang et al. (1996) mapped the ZNF180 and ZNF181 genes within a
cluster of zinc finger genes on chromosome 19q13.2.

606945	TITLE *606945 LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN RECEPTOR; LDLR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The low density lipoprotein receptor is a cell surface receptor that
plays an important role in cholesterol homeostasis.

CLONING

The low density lipoprotein receptor is synthesized as a 120-kD
glycoprotein precursor that undergoes change to a 160-kD mature
glycoprotein through the covalent addition of a 40-kD protein
(Tolleshaug et al., 1982).

Yamamoto et al. (1984) reported that the human LDL receptor is an
839-amino acid protein rich in cysteine, with multiple copies of the Alu
family of repetitive DNAs. Russell et al. (1984) demonstrated DNA
sequence homology of the LDL receptor with the epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGF; 131530).

Sudhof et al. (1985) found that 13 of the 18 exons of the gene encode
protein sequences that are homologous to sequences in other proteins: 5
encode a sequence similar to one in C9 component of complement (120940);
3 encode a sequence similar to a repeat sequence in the precursor for
EGF and in 3 proteins of the blood clotting system--factor IX (300746),
factor X (613872), and protein C (612283), and 5 other exons encode
nonrepeated sequences that are shared only with the EGF precursor. Since
the LDL receptor is a mosaic protein built up of exons shared with
different proteins, it is a member of several supergene families.
Gilbert (1985) commented on the relevance of these findings to
understanding the significance of 'split genes' and 'exon shuffling'
during evolution.

MAPPING

Francke et al. (1984) assigned the LDL receptor to chromosome 19 on the
basis of expression studies in hamster-human somatic cell hybrids. The
LDLR gene was regionalized to 19p13.1-p13.3 by in situ hybridization
(Lindgren et al., 1985).

Frank et al. (1989) identified RFLPs of the mouse LDL receptor gene and
used them to map the gene, designated Ldlr, to the proximal region of
chromosome 9. Using interspecific backcrosses, they established the
order and interval distances for this and several other loci on mouse
chromosome 9, namely, Apoa4 (107690), which is on chromosome 11 in man,
and mannosephosphate isomerase (154550), which is on chromosome 15 in
man.

GENE FUNCTION

Brown and Goldstein (1974) described LDL binding to cultured fibroblasts
in a manner consistent with a receptor, and found that this binding
resulted in suppression of cholesterol synthesis by the cell via
repression of HMG CoA reductase. In a review article, Brown and
Goldstein (1979) described the mechanism of receptor-mediated
endocytosis using the LDL receptor as the prototypic example, thus
further describing its role in cholesterol metabolism. Normally, LDL is
bound at the cell membrane and taken into the cell ending up in
lysosomes where the protein is degraded and the cholesterol is made
available for repression of microsomal enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl
coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting step in cholesterol
synthesis.

Lo et al. (2007) observed that inhibition of lymphotoxin (see 153440)
and LIGHT (TNFSF14; 604520) signaling with a soluble lymphotoxin B
receptor (LTBR; 600979) decoy protein attenuated the dyslipidemia in LDL
receptor-deficient mice, which lack the ability to control lipid levels
in the blood. The authors concluded that the immune system directly
influences lipid metabolism and that lymphotoxin modulating agents may
represent a novel therapeutic route for the treatment of dyslipidemia.

- LDL Receptor as a Viral Receptor

Hepatitis C virus (HCV), the principal viral cause of chronic hepatitis,
is not readily replicated in cell culture systems, making it difficult
to ascertain information on cell receptors for the virus. However,
several observations from studies on the role of HCV in mixed
cryoglobulinemia provided some insight into HCV entry into cells.
Evidence indicated that HCV and other viruses enter cells through the
mediation of LDL receptors: by the demonstration that endocytosis of
these viruses correlates with LDL receptor activity, by complete
inhibition of detectable endocytosis by anti-LDL receptor antibody, by
inhibition with anti-apolipoprotein E and anti-apolipoprotein B
antibodies, by chemical methods abrogating lipoprotein/LDL receptor
interactions, and by inhibition with the endocytosis inhibitor
phenylarsine oxide. Agnello et al. (1999) provided confirmatory evidence
by the lack of detectable LDL receptor on cells known to be resistant to
infection by one of these viruses, bovine viral diarrheal virus (BVDV).
Endocytosis via the LDL receptor was shown to be mediated by complexing
of the virus to very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) or LDL, but not high
density lipoprotein (HDL). Studies using LDL receptor-deficient cells or
a cytolytic BVDV system indicated that the LDL receptor may be the main
but not exclusive means of cell entry of these viruses.

Atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype (108725) shows close linkage to the
LDLR locus; indeed, the mutation(s) responsible for this phenotype may
reside in the LDLR gene rather than in a separate, closely situated
gene.

Zelcer et al. (2009) demonstrated that the sterol-responsive nuclear
liver X receptor (LXR) (see 600380) helps maintain cholesterol
homeostasis, not only through promotion of cholesterol efflux but also
through suppression of LDL uptake. LXR inhibits the LDLR pathway through
the transcriptional induction of IDOL (MYLIP; 610082), an E3 ubiquitin
ligase that triggers ubiquitination of the LDLR on its cytoplasmic
domain, thereby targeting it for degradation. LXR ligand reduced,
whereas LXR knockout increased, LDLR protein levels in vivo in a
tissue-selective manner. IDOL knockdown in hepatocytes increased LDLR
protein levels and promoted LDL uptake. Conversely, Zelcer et al. (2009)
found that adenovirus-mediated expression of IDOL in mouse liver
promoted LDLR degradation and elevated plasma LDL levels. Zelcer et al.
(2009) concluded that the LXR-IDOL-LDLR axis defines a complementary
pathway to sterol response element-binding proteins for sterol
regulation of cholesterol uptake.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Rudenko et al. (2002) described the crystal structure of the LDL
receptor extracellular domain at endosomal pH. The ligand-binding domain
(modules R2 to R7) folds back as an arc over the epidermal growth factor
precursor homology domain (the modules A, B, beta propeller, and C). The
modules R4 and R5, which are critical for lipoprotein binding, associate
with the beta propeller via their calcium-binding loop. Rudenko et al.
(2002) proposed a mechanism for lipoprotein release in the endosome
whereby the beta propeller functions as an alternate substrate for the
ligand-binding domain, binding in a calcium-dependent way and promoting
lipoprotein release.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Davis et al. (1986) found that substitution of cysteine for tyrosine in
the cytoplasmic domain of LDL receptors impedes their internalization.
Lehrman et al. (1985) found that genes with nonsense and frameshift
mutations that truncated the cytoplasmic domain resulted in
internalization-defective LDL receptors.

In a patient with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH; 143890),
Hobbs et al. (1986) described an LDL receptor mutant in which 1 of the 7
repeating units constituting the ligand binding domain had been deleted.
The deletion arose by homologous recombination by repetitive Alu
sequences in intron 4 and intron 5 of the gene. The deletion removed
exon 5, which normally encodes the sixth repeat of the ligand binding
domain. In the resultant mRNA, exon 4 was found to be spliced to exon 6,
preserving the reading frame. The resulting shortened protein reaches
the cell surface and reacts with antireceptor antibodies but does not
bind LDL. It does, however, bind VLDL, a lipoprotein that contains
apoprotein E as well as apoprotein B-100. The findings in this
instructive case support the hypothesis that the 7 repeated sequences in
the receptor constitute the LDL binding domain, that the sixth repeat is
required for binding of LDL but not of VLDL, and that deletion of a
single repeat can alter the binding specificity of the LDL receptor.

Horsthemke et al. (1987) analyzed DNA from 70 patients in the UK with
heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. In most, the restriction
fragment pattern of the LDLR gene was indistinguishable from the normal;
however, 3 patients were found to have a deletion of about 1 kb in the
central portion of the gene. In 2 patients, the deletion included all or
part of exon 5 (606945.0027); in the third, the deletion included exon 7
(606945.0033). Including a previously described patient with a deletion
in the 3-prime part of the gene, these results indicated that 4 out of
70 patients, or 6%, have deletions.

Langlois et al. (1988) screened 234 unrelated heterozygotes for FH to
detect major rearrangements in the LDLR gene. Total genomic DNA was
analyzed by Southern blot hybridization to probes encompassing exons 1
to 18 of the LDLR gene. Six different mutations were detected and
characterized by use of exon-specific probes and detailed restriction
mapping. The frequency of deletions in the Langlois et al. (1988) study
was 2.5% (6 out of 234 patients). An illustration of previously mapped
deletions and the deletions identified in this study (a total of 16)
suggested that particular areas in the LDLR gene are susceptible to
deletion.

In a Japanese subject with homozygous hypercholesterolemia, Lehrman et
al. (1987) found a 7.8-kb deletion in LDLR (606945.0029). The deletion
joined intron 15 to the middle of exon 18, which encodes the 3-prime
untranslated region, thereby removing all 3-prime splice acceptor sites
distal to intron 15. The mRNA should produce a truncated receptor that
lacks the normal membrane-COOH terminus. The truncated protein was such
that more than 90% of the receptor was secreted from the cell, and the
receptors remaining on the surface showed defective internalization. The
deletion resulted from recombination between 2 repetitive sequences of
the Alu family, one in intron 15 and the other in exon 18. Lehrman et
al. (1987) stated that Alu sequences had been found at the deletion
joints of all 4 gross deletions that had been characterized in LDLR.
Because of these and similar findings in connection with deletions in
the gamma-delta-beta-globin cluster, recombination between Alu sequences
appears to be a frequent cause of deletions in the human genome (see
EVOLUTION).

Horsthemke et al. (1987) suggested that unequal crossing-over between 2
Alu-repetitive DNA sequences was responsible for an intragenic deletion
of the LDLR gene leading to familial hypercholesterolemia. A 4-kb
deletion had occurred between an Alu-repetitive sequence in intron 12
and a sequence in intron 14. The deletion eliminated exons 13 and 14 and
changed the reading frame of the resulting spliced mRNA such that a stop
codon was created in the following exon (606945.0032). The truncated
receptor protein appeared to be rapidly degraded. The deletion was
presumably caused by an unequal crossover event between 2 homologous
chromosomes at meiosis.

Hobbs et al. (1988) found that 16 of 132 cell strains (12%) from persons
with the clinical syndrome of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia
synthesized no immunodetectable LDL receptor protein, indicating the
presence of 2 mutant genes that failed to produce crossreacting material
(CRM-negative mutants). DNA and mRNA from all but one of these
CRM-negative patients were available for study. Haplotype analysis based
on 10 RFLPs suggested that the 30 CRM-negative genes represented by
these 15 individuals had included 13 different mutant alleles. Four of
the alleles produced no mRNA; 3 of these 4 had large deletions ranging
from 6 to 20 kb that eliminated the promoter region of the gene. The
reason for the lack of mRNA in the fourth allele was not apparent. Three
alleles encoded mRNAs of abnormal size. One of the abnormal mRNAs was
produced by a gene harboring a deletion, and another was produced by a
gene with a complex rearrangement. The third abnormal-sized mRNA (3.1 kb
larger than normal) was produced by an allele that had no detectable
alteration as judged by Southern blotting. The other 6 mRNA-positive
alleles appeared normal by Southern blotting and produced normal-sized
mRNA but no receptor protein.

Among 20 mutant LDL receptor genes, Yamakawa et al. (1989) found 4
different deletion mutations (20%). None of these had been reported
previously in Caucasians. Three of them were novel and one was similar
to a previously described Japanese mutation. In 3 of the 4 deletions,
the rearrangements were related to intron 15 in which there are many Alu
sequences.

Rudiger et al. (1991) reviewed previously described deletions in the
LDLR gene in cases of familial hypercholesterolemia and reported the
finding of a deletion in 3 of 25 unrelated patients with FH. Two of
these were equivalent to previously described LDLR alterations, thus
supporting a notion of recombination hotspots which involve Alu
sequences. In at least 4 cases (FH626, PO, JA, and FH-DK3), a deletion
of exon 5 of the LDLR gene has been found as the defect responsible for
FH. The FH626 mutation was characterized by Hobbs et al. (1986) and
found to involve Alu repeat sequences in introns 4 and 5. Rudiger et al.
(1991) characterized FH-DK3 and likewise found involvement of 2 Alu
repeated sequences present in introns 4 and 5. The crossover breakpoints
involve sequences similar to those reported for FH626 but not at
identical positions in the 5-prime end. By use of denaturing gradient
gel electrophoresis (DGGE) in combination with PCR, Top et al. (1992)
found no evidence of a promoter mutation in the LDLR gene in 350
heterozygotes for FH. Hobbs et al. (1992) reviewed 71 mutations in the
LDL receptor gene that had been characterized at the molecular level and
added 79 additional mutations. Furthermore, they reviewed the insight
that all 150 mutations provided into the structure/function relationship
of the receptor protein and the clinical manifestations of FH.

Feussner et al. (1996) described a 20-year-old man with a combination of
heterozygous FH caused by splice mutation (606945.0054) and type III
hyperlipoproteinemia (107741).

Lee et al. (1998) studied 80 unrelated individuals with FH from the West
of Scotland. Microsatellite analysis using D19S394 was informative in 20
of 23 families studied. In these families, there was no inconsistency
with segregation of the FH phenotype with the LDLR locus. Using SSCP,
Lee et al. (1998) also detected mutations in exon 4 of the LDLR gene in
15 of 80 of these individuals; 7 of 15 had the same cys163-to-tyr
mutation (606945.0058). Lee et al. (1998) concluded that microsatellite
analysis using D19S394 is useful in tracking the LDLR gene in families
and could be used in conjunction with LDL cholesterol levels to diagnose
FH, especially in children and young adults, in whom phenotypic
diagnosis can be difficult.

Jensen et al. (1999) studied 17 families with mutations in the LDLR gene
as a model in which to test formally for linkage directly between an
atherogenic genotype and ischemic heart disease or aortocoronary
calcified atherosclerosis. The aortocoronary calcification was
significantly associated with age and plasma cholesterol. Sex,
hypertension, body mass index, and smoking were not associated with the
aortocoronary calcification. Nonparametric analysis indicated
significant linkage of the LDLR locus to aortic (p less than 0.00005)
and to aortocoronary calcified atherosclerosis (p less than 0.00001).
Assuming a dominant mode of inheritance, significant linkage was
detected for aortic (lod = 3.89) and aortocoronary calcified
atherosclerosis (lod = 4.10). Jensen et al. (1999) suggested that the
atherogenicity of variations in other genes could be assessed by a
similar approach.

Yamakawa et al. (1988) described a TaqI polymorphism in the LDLR gene
which should be useful in the study of FH. Leitersdorf et al. (1989)
used 10 different RFLPs to construct 123 differing haplotypes from 20
pedigrees. The 5 most common haplotypes accounted for 67.5% of the
sample. Heterozygosity and polymorphism information content (PIC) for
each site were determined.

Varret et al. (1997) described a database of LDLR genes and provided a
listing of the 210 mutations it contained as of the fall of 1996. Wilson
et al. (1998) described an online database of LDLR mutations.

Kathiresan et al. (2008) studied SNPs in 9 genes in 5,414 subjects from
the cardiovascular cohort of the Malmo Diet and Cancer Study. All 9 SNPs
had been associated with elevated LDL or lowered HDL. One of the SNPs,
dbSNP rs1529729 in the SMARCA4 gene, was highly correlated with variants
in LDLR. Kathiresan et al. (2008) replicated the associations with the 9
SNPs and created a genotype score on the basis of the number of
unfavorable alleles. With increasing genotype scores, the level of LDL
cholesterol increased, whereas the level of HDL cholesterol decreased.
At 10-year follow-up, the genotype score was found to be an independent
risk factor for incident cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction,
ischemic stroke, or death from coronary heart disease); the score did
not improve risk discrimination but modestly improved clinical risk
reclassification for individual subjects beyond standard clinical
factors.

Aulchenko et al. (2009) reported a genomewide association (GWA) study of
loci affecting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and
triglycerides sampled randomly from 16 population-based cohorts and
genotyped using mainly the Illumina HumanHap300-Duo platform. This study
included a total of 17,797 to 22,562 individuals aged 18 to 104 years
from geographic regions spanning from the Nordic countries to Southern
Europe. Aulchenko et al. (2009) established 22 loci associated with
serum lipid levels at a genomewide significance level (P less than 5 x
10(-8)), including 16 loci that were identified by previous GWA studies.
Association of the LDLR gene region identified by dbSNP rs2228671 was
found with total cholesterol levels (P = 9.3 x 10(-24)).

In a patient diagnosed with probable heterozygous FH, Bourbon et al.
(2007) analyzed the LDLR gene and identified a novel variant initially
assumed to be a silent polymorphism (R385R; 606945.0065); however,
analysis of mRNA from the patient's cells showed that the mutation
introduces a new 5-prime acceptor splice site that causes a 31-bp
deletion predicted to result in premature termination. The variant was
subsequently also found in a Chinese homozygous FH patient.

Defesche et al. (2008) analyzed the LDLR gene in 1,350 patients
clinically diagnosed with familial hypercholesterolemia who were
negative for functional DNA variation in the LDLR, APOB (107730), and
PCSK9 (607786) genes. The authors examined the effects of 128 seemingly
neutral exonic and intronic DNA variants and identified the R385R
variant in 2 Chinese families and a G186G (606945.0066) variant that
clearly affected a donor splice site and segregated with
hypercholesterolemia in 35 unrelated Dutch families.

In a metaanalysis of plasma lipid concentrations in greater than 100,000
individuals of European descent, Teslovich et al. (2010) identified SNP
dbSNP rs6511720 near the LDLR gene as having an effect on LDL
cholesterol concentrations with an effect size of -6.99 mg per deciliter
and a P value of 4 x 10(-117). This variant was also found to affect
coronary artery disease risk.

Kulseth et al. (2010) performed RNA analysis in 30 unrelated patients
with clinically defined hypercholesterolemia but without any LDLR
mutations detected by standard DNA analysis; sequencing of RT-PCR
products from an index patient revealed that the major product contained
an insertion of 81 bp from the 5-prime end of intron 14 of LDLR. DNA
sequencing of exons 13 and 14 detected an intronic mutation
(606945.0067) that segregated in heterozygosity with elevated
cholesterol in the proband's family. Kulseth et al. (2010) analyzed an
additional 550 index patients and identified the same splice site
mutation in 3 more probands.

Noting that large-scale genetic cascade screening for familial
hypercholesterolemia showed that 15% of LDLR or APOB mutation carriers
had LDLC levels below the 75th percentile, Huijgen et al. (2010)
proposed 3 criteria for determining pathogenicity of such mutations:
mean LDLC greater than the 75th percentile, higher mean LDLC level in
untreated than in treated carriers, and higher percentage of medication
users in carriers than in noncarriers at screening. Applying these
criteria to 46 mutations found in more than 50 untreated adults, 3 of
the mutations were determined to be nonpathogenic: 1 in LDLR and 2 in
APOB. Nonpathogenicity of the 3 variants was confirmed by segregation
analysis. Huijgen et al. (2010) emphasized that novel sequence changes
in LDLR and APOB should be interpreted with caution before being
incorporated into a cascade screening program.

- Modifiers

Vergopoulos et al. (1997) presented findings suggesting the existence of
a xanthomatosis susceptibility gene in a consanguineous Syrian kindred
containing 6 individuals with homozygous FH (see 602247). Half of the
homozygotes had giant xanthomas, while half did not, even though their
LDL cholesterol concentrations were elevated to similar degrees (more
than 14 mmol/l). Heterozygous FH individuals in this family were also
clearly distinguishable with respect to xanthoma size. By DNA analysis
they identified a hitherto undescribed mutation in the LDLR gene in this
family: a T-to-C transition at nucleotide 1999 in codon 646 of exon 14,
resulting in an arginine for cysteine substitution. Segregation analysis
suggested that a separate susceptibility gene may explain the formation
of giant xanthomas.

In a 13-year-old girl with severe hypercholesterolemia, Ekstrom et al.
(1999) demonstrated compound heterozygosity for a cys240-to-phe mutation
(606945.0059) and a tyr167-to-ter mutation (606945.0045) in the LDLR
gene. Her 2 heterozygous sibs also carried the C240F mutation, but only
one of them was hypercholesterolemic. The authors concluded that there
may be cholesterol-lowering mechanisms that are activated by mutations
in other genes (see 143890).

Knoblauch et al. (2000) studied an Arab family that carried the
tyr807-to-cys substitution (606945.0019). In this family, some
heterozygous persons had normal LDL levels, while some homozygous
individuals had LDL levels similar to those persons with heterozygous
FH. The authors presented evidence for the existence of a
cholesterol-lowering gene on 13q (604595).

Based on the finding from bioinformatic analysis that Alu repeats
represent 85% of LDLR intronic sequences outside exon-intron junctions,
Amsellem et al. (2002) designed a strategy to improve the exploration of
genomic regions in the vicinity of exons in 110 FH subjects from an
admixed population. In the first group of 42 patients found negative for
mutations by former screening strategies, approximately half (22) were
carriers of at least 1 heterozygous mutation. Among a second group of 68
patients recruited to correct for ascertainment bias toward exonic
mutations, 37 (27%) mutation carriers had a splicing regulatory
mutation. Of the 54 mutations identified, 13 were intronic and 18 were
novel, nearly half of which were intronic. Amsellem et al. (2002) stated
that their strategy of detecting the most likely disease-causing LDLR
mutations outside of Alu-rich genomic regions revealed that intronic
mutations may have a greater impact on the molecular basis of FH than
previously reported.

POPULATION GENETICS

Seftel et al. (1980) pointed to a high frequency of hypercholesterolemic
homozygotes in South Africa. In a 7-year period, 34 homozygotes were
seen in one clinic in Johannesburg. All were Afrikaners and most lived
in Transvaal Province. The authors calculated the frequency of
heterozygotes and homozygotes to be 1 in 100 and 1 in 30,000,
respectively. The oldest of their patients was a 46-year-old woman. Of
the 34, six were age 30 or older. The authors concluded that the high
frequency of the gene is attributable to founder effect, as in the case
of porphyria variegata (176200), lipoid proteinosis (247100), and
sclerosteosis (269500). Torrington and Botha (1981) found that 20 of 26
families with FHC (77%) belonged to the Gereformeerde Kerk, whereas
according to the 1970 census only 5% of the Afrikaans-speaking white
population of South Africa belonged to this religious group. Again, the
data were consistent with a founder effect. Using the LDLR activity of
lymphocytes, Steyn et al. (1989) calculated the prevalence of
heterozygous FHC in the permanent residents of a predominantly
Afrikaans-speaking community in South Africa to be 1 in 71--the highest
prevalence reported to date.

Hobbs et al. (1987) found a large deletion (more than 10 kb) in the LDLR
gene in 63% of French Canadians with heterozygous FH. The deletion also
occurred in homozygous form in 4 of 7 French-Canadian homozygotes. The
deletion removed the promoter and first exon of the gene and abolished
the production of mRNA for LDL receptor. The high frequency of the
mutation was interpreted as representing founder effect; 8,000 ancestors
account for present-day French Canadians and there has been relatively
little outbreeding. The deletion has not been observed in any other
ethnic group. It can be detected by analysis of genomic DNA from blood
leukocytes, thus allowing direct diagnosis of FH in most affected French
Canadians. Ma et al. (1989) identified a second 'French Canadian' LDLR
gene deletion which was found in 4 of 80 heterozygotes (5%). The
mutation consisted of a 5-kb deletion removing exons 2 and 3 of the LDLR
gene, which corresponded to the first 2 repeats of the LDLR-binding
domain (606945.0026).

Leitersdorf et al. (1990) analyzed the LDL receptor genes of 11 French
Canadian FH homozygotes. Only 3 different LDLR haplotypes were
identified, and the coding region of the allele associated with each was
sequenced. Three different missense mutations were found. Assays
developed to detect each of these directly were applied to 130 FH
heterozygotes from the greater Montreal area. The common deletion
(606945.0025) responsible for about 60% of cases (Hobbs et al., 1987)
and the smaller deletion (606945.0026) identified by Ma et al. (1989)
and found in about 5% of French Canadians were also sought. They were
able to detect LDL receptor mutations in 76% of the subjects and 14% had
1 of the 3 missense mutations. In the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region of
Quebec province, De Braekeleer (1991) estimated the prevalence of
familial hypercholesterolemia as 1/122, compared to the usually
estimated frequency of 1/500 for European populations.

Like the French Canadians, the South Afrikaners appear to have a unique
form of mutation in the LDLR gene consistent with founder effect (Brink
et al., 1987). Because of the presumed role of founder effect on the
high frequency of familial hypercholesterolemia in South Africa, it is
not surprising that Kotze et al. (1987) found a predominance of 2
haplotypes in 27 informative families with FH. In a study of homozygotes
from the Afrikaner population in South Africa, Leitersdorf et al. (1989)
found that 2 mutations account for more than 95% of the mutant LDL
receptor genes. Both mutations were basepair substitutions that resulted
in a single amino acid change and both could be detected readily with
PCR and restriction analysis. The findings were considered consistent
with the high frequency of FH being due to founder effect. Graadt van
Roggen et al. (1991) studied the prevalence and distribution of the 3
common mutations in South Africa in 27 unrelated homozygous and 79
unrelated heterozygous FH Afrikaner patients from 2 regions of South
Africa, the Transvaal and Cape Provinces. The 3 mutations were FH
Afrikaner-1 (606945.0006), FH Afrikaner-2 (606945.0009), and FH
Afrikaner-3 (606945.0044). The relative distribution of each of the 3
mutations was similar in the 2 regions, with frequencies of 66, 27, and
7%, respectively. Defects other than the 3 common mutations were more
frequent in the Cape than in the Transvaal; thus, the 3 known mutations
accounted for 98% of FH alleles in the Transvaal and only 74% in the
Cape Province. None of the patients carried the familial apolipoprotein
B-100 mutation.

Schuster et al. (1995) identified yet another homozygote for the
val408-to-met mutation (606945.0009), a 12-year-old Greek boy living in
Germany. The mutation was present in both his parents, his brother,
grandmother, uncle, and cousin. The haplotype, using 6 RFLPs of the LDL
receptor gene, was different from the one reported earlier in Afrikaner
and Dutch FH patients. Schuster et al. (1995) concluded that the
mutation in the Greek boy probably occurred independently. Furthermore,
they speculated that, because the parents were from different areas in
Greece, the mutation may be common in Greeks.

Deletion of gly197 (606945.0005) is the most prevalent LDL receptor
mutation causing familial hypercholesterolemia in Ashkenazi Jewish
individuals. Studying index cases from Israel, South Africa, Russia, the
Netherlands, and the United States, Durst et al. (2001) found that all
traced their ancestry to Lithuania. A highly conserved haplotype was
identified in chromosomes carrying this deletion, suggesting a common
founder. When 2 methods were used for analysis of linkage disequilibrium
between flanking polymorphic markers and the disease locus and for the
study of the decay of LD over time, the estimated age of the deletion
was found to be 20 +/- 7 generations, so that the most recent common
ancestor of the mutation-bearing chromosomes would date to the 14th
century. This corresponds with the founding of the Jewish community of
Lithuania (1338 A.D.), as well as with the great demographic expansion
of Ashkenazi Jewish individuals in eastern Europe, which followed this
settlement. Durst et al. (2001) could find no evidence supporting a
selective evolutionary metabolic advantage. Therefore, the founder
effect in a rapidly expanding population from a limited number of
families remains a simple, parsimonious hypothesis explaining the spread
of this mutation in Ashkenazi Jewish individuals.

Defesche and Kastelein (1998) stated that more than 350 different
mutations had been found in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia.
They tabulated the preferential geographic distribution that has been
demonstrated for some of the LDL receptor mutations. For example, in the
West of Scotland about half of the index cases of FH were found to have
the cys163-to-tyr mutation (606945.0058). Defesche and Kastelein (1998)
commented on the geographic associations of LDL receptor mutations
within the Netherlands.

EVOLUTION

Alu sequences are widely scattered in the genome, being present in
300,000 to 500,000 copies. They have been described, for example, in the
genes for alpha-globin (see 141800), gastrin (137250), gamma crystallin
(123660), insulin-like growth factor II (147470), and soluble thymidine
kinase. Each is about 300 bp long; thus Alu sequences represent about 3%
of the total DNA. On the basis of structural similarity, the origin of
Alu elements can be traced to the gene for 7SL RNA (Ullu and Tschudi,
1984). The abundant cytoplasmic 7SL RNA functions in protein secretion
as a component of the signal-recognition particle. This particle,
consisting of 6 different polypeptides and 1 molecule of 7SL RNA,
mediates the translocation of secretory proteins across the cytoplasmic
reticulum. Although the 7SL RNA has a well-defined biologic function,
that of the related Alu repeat remains unknown. Thus, the 7SL RNA gene
may be a progenitor of a processed pseudogene, the Alu element, that has
'recently' spread to different locations in the human genome. The
average Alu family member probably integrated into its present genomic
location about 15-30 Myr ago. The Alu family is specific to primates,
suggesting that these repeats were not present as little as 65 Myr ago.

According to the Alu family copy number, one would, on the average,
expect to find 1 such repeat every 3 to 5 kb in the human genome if they
are randomly distributed. However, studies of the
albumin/alpha-fetoprotein family by Ruffner et al. (1987) and of the
thymidine kinase (188300) and beta-tubulin (191130) genes by Slagel et
al. (1987) indicate clustering of Alu repeats in some parts of the
genome. For example, the beta-tubulin gene has 10 of these repeats in
less than 5 kb of a single intron and the thymidine kinase has 13
members within its introns in a region of about 10 kb.

HISTORY

Some early studies of somatic hybrid cells suggested that the gene(s)
for low density lipoprotein receptor may be on chromosome 5 or 21 or
both (Maartmann-Moe et al., 1982).

Li et al. (1988) worked out a PCR method for analyzing DNA sequences in
individual diploid cells and human sperm. They showed that 2 genetic
loci could be coamplified from a single sperm, and proposed its use for
genetic linkage studies. They analyzed the genotype of single sperm
derived from an individual heterozygous at the LDLR locus and the
HLA-DQ(alpha) locus and could show independent assortment. Individual
sperm were drawn into a fine plastic needle under microscopic
observation and delivered to a tube for lysis and amplification. Eighty
individual sperm were analyzed for the study of independent assortment
of LDLR and DQA. The method has great promise for fine mapping. Boehnke
et al. (1989) described the experimental design and issues of sample
size to be considered in the application of the method to the generation
of fine-structure human genetic maps.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using Ldlr -/- mice expressing the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus
(LCMV) glycoprotein (GP) transgene under control of the insulin
promoter, which functions as a mouse model in which type 1 diabetes
(125853) can be induced at will, Johansson et al. (2008) administered a
high-fat diet for 16 weeks to induce the development of advanced
atherosclerotic lesions before inducing diabetes. After the onset of
diabetes, there was increased intraplaque hemorrhage and plaque
disruption, regardless of lesion size, in mice fed low- or high-fat
diets for an additional 14 weeks. Furthermore, diabetes resulted in
increased accumulation of monocytic cells positive for S100A9 (123886),
a proinflammatory biomarker for cardiovascular events, and for a
macrophage marker protein, without increasing lesion macrophage content,
and S100A9 immunoreactivity correlated with intraplaque hemorrhage.
Hyperglycemia was not sufficient to induce plaque disruption: aggressive
lipid lowering, primarily of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, prevented
both plaque disruption and the increased S100A9 in diabetic
atherosclerotic lesions. Conversely, oleate promoted macrophage
differentiation into an S100A9-positive population in vitro, thereby
mimicking the effects of diabetes. Johansson et al. (2008) concluded
that diabetes increases plaque disruption independently of effects on
plaque initiation, through a mechanism that requires triglyceride-rich
lipoproteins and is associated with an increased accumulation of
S100A9-positive monocytic cells, and that this represents an important
link between diabetes, plaque disruption, and the innate immune system.

Lewis et al. (2009) generated mice lacking C1qa (120550) and/or serum
IgM (147020) as well as Ldlr and studied them on both low- and high-fat
semisynthetic diets. On both diets, serum IgM/Ldlr -/- mice developed
substantially larger and more complex en face and aortic root
atherosclerotic lesions, with accelerated cholesterol crystal formation
and increased smooth muscle content in aortic root lesions. TUNEL
analysis revealed increased apoptosis in both C1qa/Ldlr -/- and serum
IgM/Ldlr -/- mice. Overall lesions were larger in mice lacking IgM
rather than C1q, suggesting that IgM protective mechanisms are partially
independent of classic complement pathway activation and apoptotic cell
clearance. Lewis et al. (2009) concluded that IgM antibodies play a
central role in protection against atherosclerosis.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
FH TURKEY
LDLR, GLN12TER

In a homozygote with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH; 143890) of
Turkish ancestry, Leitersdorf and Hobbs (1990) identified a CAG-to-TAG
change in codon 12 converting glutamine to a stop codon.

.0002
FH CAPE TOWN 1
LDLR, ASP26/GLY27DEL

In a South African black with FH (143890), Leitersdorf et al. (1988)
demonstrated deletion of aspartic acid-26 and glycine-27 due to deletion
of the 6 nucleotides of codons 26 and 27: GCGATG.

Thiart et al. (2000) found this mutation in 28% of mutant alleles in 56
South African black patients.

.0003
FH FRENCH CANADIAN 4
LDLR, TRP66GLY

This change in exon 3 is a class 3 binding-defective mutation
(Leitersdorf et al., 1990). In the French-Canadian population of a
province in Quebec, Moorjani et al. (1993) compared the clinical
features of homozygous FH (143890) because of the relatively high
frequency of a small number of mutations. In a comparison of 10 subjects
who had the trp66-to-gly (W66G) mutation in exon 3 with 11 subjects who
were homozygous for the 'greater than 10 kb' deletion of the promoter
region in exon 1 (606945.0025), they found the following: mean plasma
cholesterol concentration was higher in the subjects with the deletion
and there was no overlap in values in the 2 groups. Although the
frequency of coronary heart disease was similar in the 2 groups, age of
onset was earlier in subjects with the deletion; in addition, coronary
deaths were more frequent and occurred at an earlier age in the deletion
subjects.

Grossman et al. (1994) reported a 29-year-old woman with FH and a
homozygous W66G mutation who underwent hepatocyte-directed ex vivo gene
therapy with LDLR-expressing retroviruses. She tolerated the procedures
well, liver biopsy after 4 months showed engraftment of the transgene,
and there was no clinical or pathologic evidence for autoimmune
hepatitis. The patient showed an improvement in serum lipids up to 18
months after the treatment.

.0004
FH PUERTO RICO
LDLR, SER156LEU

Hobbs et al. (1989) found this missense mutation in a Puerto Rican
kindred that appeared to have an independently segregating mutation that
suppressed the hypercholesterolemia phenotype in some heterozygotes (see
144020). The same mutation was identified in a German family by Schuster
et al. (1993).

.0005
FH PISCATAWAY
FH LITHUANIA
LDLR, GLY197DEL

Meiner et al. (1991) found that the mutation was responsible for 35% of
71 Ashkenazi-Jewish FH (143890) families in Israel. Of the 25 Ashkenazi
patients who carried the mutant allele, 16 were of Lithuanian origin.
The mutation was not found in 47 non-Ashkenazi FH families. The mutation
was found in 8 of 10 FH cases in the Jewish community in South Africa,
which originated mainly from Lithuania. PCR amplification of a DNA
fragment that includes the mutation in heterozygous individuals results
in the formation of a heteroduplex that can be demonstrated by PAGE and
used for molecular diagnosis.

Mandelshtam et al. (1998) found this mutation in one-third (7 of 23) of
familial hypercholesterolemia cases in St. Petersburg (Russia) Jews and
in no patients of Russian descent.

.0006
FH AFRIKANER 1
FH MAINE
LDLR, ASP206GLU

Kotze et al. (1990) demonstrated a cytosine-to-guanine base substitution
at nucleotide 681 resulting in an amino acid change from aspartic acid
to glutamic acid at residue 206 (D206E) in the cysteine-rich
ligand-binding domain of the LDL receptor. The mutation gives rise to an
additional DdeI restriction site; segregation of the mutation with the
disease was confirmed in 5 large Afrikaner FH (143890) families. Kotze
et al. (1990) predicted that 65% of affected South African Afrikaners
carry this particular base substitution which can be diagnosed by PCR
amplification of genomic DNA followed by restriction enzyme analysis.
Indeed, from analysis of 138 chromosomes of Afrikaner FH (143890)
patients, Kotze et al. (1991) found this mutation in 91 (68.4%). Komuro
et al. (1987) described a homozygote for defective internalization of
the LDL receptor who survived to age 57. Leitersdorf and Hobbs (1990)
found the same mutation in an English-American living in Maine.

Vergotine et al. (2001) demonstrated the feasibility of prenatal
diagnosis of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia in an Afrikaner
family with the D206E mutation.

.0007
FH MEXICO
FH FRENCH CANADIAN 3
LDLR, GLU207LYS

Codon 207 (GAG) is changed to AAG (Leitersdorf and Hobbs, 1990). The
same mutation was found in French Canadians with FH (143890)
(Leitersdorf et al., 1990).

.0008
FH DENVER 2
LDLR, ASP283ASN

In an African American patient with FH (143890), Leitersdorf and Hobbs
(1990) found a change of aspartic acid-283 (GAC) to asparagine (AAC).

.0009
FH AFRIKANER 2
LDLR, VAL408MET

This and the asp206-to-glu mutation (see 606945.0006) are frequent among
Afrikaners with FH (143890). A GTG-to-ATG mutation is responsible
(Leitersdorf et al., 1989). In a study of 138 chromosomes of Afrikaner
FH patients, Kotze et al. (1991) found that 31 (23.3%) had this
mutation. Schuster et al. (1993) found the same mutation in a German
family and showed that it existed on the same 7-RFLP haplotype as did
the mutation described in South Africa and in the Netherlands,
suggesting a common European origin. Similarly, Defesche et al. (1993)
found the val408-to-met mutation in 19 (1.5%) of 1,268 FH patients of
Dutch descent. In 9 of the patients carrying this mutation on one
allele, the LDLR DNA haplotype was that observed in a South African FH
patient homozygous for the same mutation. The remaining 10 Dutch FH
patients all shared a common haplotype, partly identical to the
Afrikaner haplotype, which could have arisen from a single
recombinational event. With the exception of the family reported by
Schuster et al. (1993), this mutation has been described only in persons
of Dutch ancestry.

.0010

A GCT-to-ACT change is responsible for this variant (Zuliani and Hobbs,
1990).

A GTG-to-ATG mutation is responsible for this variant (Zuliani and
Hobbs, 1990).

A GGT-to-GAT mutation is responsible for this variant (Leitersdorf and
Hobbs, 1990).

Esser and Russell (1988) found a GGC-to-GTC mutation as the basis of
this variant.

.0015
FH FRENCH CANADIAN 2
LDLR, CYS646TYR

Leitersdorf et al. (1990) found a TGT-to-TAT mutation in exon 14 as the
basis of this variant. See 606945.0003, 606945.0007, 606945.0025, and
606945.0026 for other French Canadian mutations.

.0016
FH LEBANESE
LDLR, CYS660TER

Lehrman et al. (1987) analyzed the nature of the LDLR mutation present
in high frequency in Lebanon; the frequency of homozygotes is more than
10 times higher than in other parts of the world. It was on the basis of
studies in Lebanon that Khachadurian (1964) first established the
existence of homozygous FHC (143890). Lehrman et al. (1987) demonstrated
that the mutation involves a shortened receptor protein containing 3
domains: the region of clustered O-linked carbohydrates, the
membrane-spanning region, and the cytoplasmic tail. The defect was
attributable to a single nucleotide substitution that creates a
premature termination codon at amino acid 660, eliminating 180 residues
from the mature protein. The termination codon occurred in the middle of
a cysteine-rich sequence that is part of the domain homologous to
epidermal growth factor precursor. The truncated protein retains only 2
domains: a complete ligand-binding region (residues 1-292) and a partial
epidermal growth factor precursor homology region (residues 293-659).
The mutant gene lacks the portions that code for the membrane-spanning
region and the cytoplasmic tail. After synthesis, most of the mutant
receptor remains within the cell. The mutation creates a new restriction
site for the enzyme HinfI, thus permitting diagnosis by Southern
blotting of genomic DNA. Lehrman et al. (1987) studied 4 unrelated Arab
patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, 3 from Lebanon
and 1 from Syria. They referred to this mutation as the Lebanese allele.
In 5 Christian-Arab kindreds in Israel, Oppenheim et al. (1991) found
the 'Lebanese' allele in correlation with hypercholesterolemia. In
addition, their results suggested the possible existence of an
independent factor contributing to elevated LDL cholesterol levels.

.0017
FH ZAMBIA
LDLR, PRO664LEU

In an Asiatic Indian with FH (143890), Knight et al. (1989) and Soutar
et al. (1989) found a CCG-to-CTG mutation changing proline-664 to
leucine. Knight et al. (1989) found that the precursor form of the
mutant receptor is converted more slowly than normal, and the mature
form on the cell surface binds LDL less well than normal. Soutar et al.
(1991) identified this mutation in a large Asian-Indian kindred
containing 22 heterozygotes and 3 homozygotes. All the heterozygotes had
a raised level of plasma total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein
cholesterol, but were remarkably free from premature coronary disease.
No correlation could be found between the apo(a) phenotype (152200) and
the presence or absence of the LDLR mutation. There was, however,
evidence for an inherited trait that markedly increased Lp(a)
concentration, which did not segregate with either apo(a) or the
defective LDLR allele. FH Zambia was found in a patient with familial
hypercholesterolemia who was of Indian origin residing in Zambia.
Rubinsztein et al. (1992) found the same mutation in 4 South African
families of Muslim religion who traced their origin to the vicinity of
Surat in the Gujerat province of India. Functional studies suggested
that the FH in these subjects was due to low steady-state levels of
receptor molecules that are functionally normal but exhibit accelerated
turnover.

Among 915 consecutive patients with FH and of Dutch descent, Defesche et
al. (1992) found 7 persons with the C-to-T transition at nucleotide 2054
in exon 14. All the patients shared the same haplotype. Contrary to
previous reports, no difference was found in plasma levels of Lp(a)
between family members with the mutation in exon 14 and unaffected
persons.

.0018
FH BAHRAIN
LDLR, TRP792TER

In a Bahraini patient with FH (143890), Lehrman et al. (1985) found a
change in the tryptophan-792 codon to a stop codon as the basis of this
variant. Truncation of the cytoplasmic domain of the LDLR protein
results in defective internalization. Recurrence of this mutation was
observed by Loux et al. (1991) in the course of a survey of 139
unrelated French FH subjects.

.0019
FH BARI
FH SYRIA
LDLR, TYR807CYS

In an Italian patient with FH (143890), Davis et al. (1986) found a
TAT-to-TGT mutation in this internalization-defective allele.

.0020
FH NASHVILLE
LDLR, 4-BP INS, EX8

In an American patient with FH (143890), Leitersdorf and Hobbs (1990)
found insertion of 4 nucleotides in exon 8 causing frameshift and
premature termination as the basis of this null allele.

.0021
FH PARIS 3
LDLR, 4-BP INS, EX17

In a French patient with FH (143890), Lehrman et al. (1985) found
insertion of 4 nucleotides in exon 17 causing frameshift and premature
termination as the basis of this internalization-defective allele.
Benlian et al. (1990) found the same duplication of 4 bases in exon 17
as the basis of familial hypercholesterolemia in a homozygous offspring
of consanguineous French parents and in heterozygous relatives. The same
mutation was not found in any normal individuals or in 158 other
individuals with hypercholesterolemia type IIa. The duplication involved
the third nucleotide of codon 796 and the 3 nucleotides of codon 797,
resulting in a frameshift and a stop codon 20 basepairs downstream.

.0022
FH PORTUGAL
LDLR, ASP203ASN

In Portuguese patients with FH (143890), Hobbs et al. (1992) identified
a G-A transition in exon 4 of the LDLR gene, resulting in an
asp203-to-asn (D203N) substitution. The mutation was not found in over
200 non-FH alleles.

.0023
FH ST. LOUIS
LDLR, EX2-8DUP

In an American child homozygous for FH (143890), Lehrman et al. (1987)
found that the LDL receptor precursor was unusually long due to a
duplication of 7 exons. Unequal crossing-over between homologous
repetitive elements (Alu sequences) in intron 1 and intron 8 was the
basis of the duplication.

.0024
FH PARIS 2
LDLR, EX2-5DUP

In a French patient with FH (143890), Leitersdorf and Hobbs (1990) found
this mutation.

.0025
FH FRENCH CANADIAN 1
FH DENVER
LDLR, PROMOTER/EX1 DEL

Deletion of the promoter and exon 1 of the LDLR gene resulting in a null
allele is the mutation found in about 60% of French Canadian cases of FH
(143890) in Quebec (Hobbs et al., 1987; Leitersdorf et al., 1990).
Leitersdorf et al. (1990) quoted work indicating that all persons with
the 'French-Canadian deletion' trace their ancestry to a small town
northeast of Montreal called Kamouraska, thus illustrating founder
effect. Founder effect was suggested as well by the fact that the
mutation was also found in France where it was, however, rare (Fumeron
et al., 1992). The same mutation was found in a non-French Canadian
Caucasian in Denver, Colorado (Hobbs et al., 1988). Betard et al. (1992)
found that the 10-kb deletion had the same haplotype, called the B
haplotype. They identified 15 different haplotypes for the normal allele
in heterozygotes. Thus, founder effect is again supported.

(It is more accurate to state that Kamouraska is northeast of Quebec
City on the south side of the St. Lawrence River. See 609313 for a
unique form of erythrokeratodermia variabilis, designated the Kamouraska
type and symbolized EKV3, that has been identified in families living in
the same region of Quebec.)

Simard et al. (2004) identified the breakpoint of the more than 15-kb
deletion involving the promoter and exon 1 of the LDLR gene, as well as
the breakpoint of the 5-kb deletion of exons 2 and 3 (606945.0026),
which accounts for 5% of French-Canadian FH cases. Both deletions
appeared to be the result of homologous recombination by unequal
crossing over between the left arms of Alu repeats. Simard et al. (2004)
determined that 55% of the LDLR gene is composed of Alu elements; thus,
it is not surprising that most LDLR rearrangements involve at least 1
Alu. They developed a rapid PCR-based assay for these 2
'French-Canadian' deletions. Screening of a representative population
sample of 943 French-Canadian youths whose LDL cholesterol levels were
above the 50th percentile allowed Simard et al. (2004) to estimate the
prevalence of the more than 15-kb allele as 0.11% (95% confidence
interval, 0.03 to 0.38).

.0026

Ma et al. (1989) found deletion of exons 2 and 3 in a French Canadian
patient with FH (143890). The same mutation was found in 2 Japanese
patients with homozygous FH and called FH Tonami-2 (Kajinami et al.,
1989) and FH Tsukuba-1 (Yamakawa et al., 1989).

.0027

In a French patient with FH (143890), Hobbs et al. (1986) found deletion

LDLR, EX7-8DEL

In South African patients with FH (143890), Henderson et al. (1988)
detected a hitherto undescribed 2.5-kb deletion in the central region of
the LDLR gene, most likely including all of exons 7 and 8. The same
mutation was present in a Dutch patient in Leuven (Russell et al.,
1986).

.0029
FH ROCHESTER
FH OSAKA 1;;
FH HELSINKI
LDLR, EX16-18DEL

In an American patient with FH (143890), Lehrman et al. (1985) found
deletion of exons 16, 17, and part of 18, due apparently to Alu-Alu
recombination. The same mutation was found in Japanese by Lehrman et al.
(1987) and in many Finns by Aalto-Setala et al. (1989). A 9.5-kb
deletion extended from intron 15 to exon 18. Because of loss of the
domains encoded by exons 16, 17, and 18, the carboxy-terminal portion of
the normal receptor, comprising amino acids 750-839, has been replaced
by an unrelated stretch of 55 amino acids. This particular mutation was
found in 23 of 46 unrelated Finnish FH patients with an established
functional defect of LDLR. In cultured fibroblasts, both
receptor-mediated binding and internalization of LDL were reduced on the
average by 25 and 50%, respectively. Aalto-Setala et al. (1989) referred
to the mutation as FH-Helsinki. Rodningen et al. (1992) found the same
mutation in 3 out of 181 (1.7%) unrelated Norwegian FH subjects. All 3
showed the same haplotype. Aalto-Setala et al. (1992) found that the
FH-Helsinki mutation was present in 75 (38%) of 199 unrelated Finnish
patients with hypercholesterolemia. The prevalence ranged from 26 to 58%
in different areas of Finland, with the striking exception of the North
Karelia region where only 1 of 26 (4%) FH patients carried the
FH-Helsinki allele.

substitution in codon 167, changing the sense from tyrosine to stop. The
mutation was in exon 4, which encodes the fourth repeat of the binding

demographic data concerning the Druze.

.0046
FH PAVIA
LDLR, EX2-12DEL

Bertolini et al. (1992) found a large rearrangement of the LDLR gene in
3 apparently unrelated families segregating for FH (143890) living in
northern Italy. Southern blot analysis demonstrated heterozygosity for a
25-kb deletion eliminating exons 2-12. The affected subjects possessed 2
LDL receptor mRNA species: one of normal size (5.3 kb) and one of
smaller size (3.5 kb). In the latter mRNA, the coding sequence of exon 1
was joined to the coding sequence of exon 13, causing a change in the
reading frame and thereby giving rise to a premature stop codon. The
predicted receptor protein, a short polypeptide of 29 amino acids, would
be expected to be devoid of any function. Bertolini et al. (1992) found
a common ancestor for the 3 families who had lived in the 17th century
in a region called Lomellina in southwest Lombardy, near Pavia.

Koivisto et al. (1992) identified a mutation found in many Finnish

North Karelia (FH-NK) , deleted 7 nucleotides from exon 6 of the LDLR
gene, caused a translational frameshift, and was predicted to result in
a truncated receptor protein. The mutation was found in 69 (34%) of 201
unrelated Finnish FH patients and was especially frequent (prevalence
79%) in patients from eastern Finland. FH Helsinki (606945.0029) and FH
North Karelia together account for about two-thirds of FH mutations in
Finland.

In Finnish North Karelia, with a population of about 180,000, Vuorio et
al. (1997) found that the FH-NK mutation accounts for 84% (340 of 407)
of FH cases, while the FH-Helsinki allele was found in 4% (18 cases).
The minimum prevalence of FH in North Karelia was estimated to be 1 in
441 inhabitants; in 1 commune, a frequency of 1 in 143 was found. By use
of parish and tax records, they identified a common ancestor for most of
the North Karelian FH-NK persons in the village of Puso, located within
an area where the FH prevalence is the highest. DNA analysis indicated
that 2% of subjects aged 1 to 25 years would have been diagnosed as
false-negative and 7% as false-positive FH patients on the basis of LDL
cholesterol determinations alone. Coronary heart disease (CHD) was
present in 65 (30%) of the 179 FH gene carriers aged 25 years or more,
and 19 individuals had a previous history of acute myocardial
infarction. The average age at onset of CHD was 42 years for males and
48 years for females.

FH LONDON 3
LDLR, CYS210TER

In an Irish subject with familial hypercholesterolemia (143890), 1 of
200 patients attending lipid clinics in the London area, Gudnason et al.
(1993) found a GCG-to-GAG transversion changing cys210 to a stop codon.

.0049
FH LONDON 4
LDLR, 2-BP DEL, 694AC

In 5 patients of British extraction with familial hypercholesterolemia
(143890), Gudnason et al. (1993) found deletion of the last 2 bases (694
and 695) of codon 206 (GAC).

.0050
FH OSAKA 3
LDLR, ASP412HIS

In a Japanese patient with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia
(143890), Miyake et al. (1992) identified a G-to-C transversion in exon
9 which was predicted to change asp412 to his. The amino acid change
occurred in the epidermal growth-factor-precursor homology domain of the
LDL receptor. Both in the fibroblasts of the patient and in transfected
COS-1 cells, the mutant protein showed impaired processing and rapid
degradation. Members of the family carrying the mutant gene in
heterozygous state showed higher serum cholesterol levels than the
others; however, cholesterol levels were also influenced by the
apolipoprotein E phenotype. The mutant LDLR reported by Miyake et al.
(1992) is designated here FH Osaka-3.

.0051
FH AFRIKANER 4
LDLR, 18-BP DUP

Kotze et al. (1995) identified a de novo duplication in the LDLR gene in
the course of screening hypercholesterolemics who did not have 1 of the
3 known mutations responsible for the high frequency of FH (143890)
(more than 1/100) in South African Afrikaners. The de novo duplication
of 18 basepairs in exon 4 occurred after nucleotide 678 (or 681) of
their sequence. The authors suggested that the resultant change is
severe, because the corresponding duplicated amino acids 200-205 (or
201-206) are highly conserved in E/apo B binding repeat 5 of LDLC. One
of the daughters of the index patient inherited the defective LDLR gene,
which was absent in both grandparents. Kotze et al. (1995) suggested
that this was the first report of a molecularly characterized de novo
mutation associated with FH.

.0052
FH TURKU
LDLR, GLY823ASP

Two deletions, designated FH-Helsinki (143890.0029) and FH-North Karelia
(143890.0047), account for the mutations present in approximately 60 to
70% of all heterozygous FH (143890) probands in Finland. Koivisto et al.
(1995) screened the DNA samples from a cohort representing the remaining
30% of heterozygous patients by amplifying all 18 exons of the LDLR gene
by PCR and searching for DNA variations with the SSCP technique. Ten
novel mutations were identified, comprising 2 nonsense and 7 missense
mutations, as well as 1 frameshift mutation caused by a 13-bp deletion.
Koivisto et al. (1995) found a single nucleotide change, substituting
adenine for guanine at position 2533 of their sequence and resulting in
a gly823-to-asp amino acid change, in DNA samples from 14 unrelated FH
probands. The mutation, designated FH-Turku, affected the sequence
encoding the putative basolateral sorting signal of the LDL receptor
protein. The FH-Turku gene and another point mutation, FH-Pori (leu380
to his; 606945.0053), accounted for approximately 8% of the FH-causing
gene alterations in Finland and were found to be particularly common
among FH patients from the southwestern part of the country. The
FH-Turku missense mutation was the one closest to the C terminus of LDLR
identified to date.

Koivisto et al. (2001) showed that the FH-Turku mutant receptor is
mistargeted to the apical surface in both Madin-Darby canine kidney
(MDCK) cells and hepatic epithelial cells, resulting in reduced
endocytosis of LDL from the basolateral/sinusoidal surface.
Consequently, virally encoded mutant receptor fails to mediate
cholesterol clearance in LDL receptor-deficient mice, suggesting that a
defect in polarized LDL receptor expression in hepatocytes underlies the
hypercholesterolemia in patients harboring this allele. This evidence
directly links the pathogenesis of a human disease to defects in
basolateral targeting signals, providing a genetic confirmation of these
signals in maintaining epithelial cell polarity.

FH ELVERUM
LDLR, IVS3, G-A, +1

In Norway, Leren et al. (1994) identified a splice mutation, a G-to-A
change of the first base of intron 3 destroying the conserved GT splice
donor site of intron 3 of the LDLR gene. The same mutation was reported
in patients with FH (143890) in England (Sun et al., 1995) and Germany
(Feussner et al., 1996).

.0055
FH AARHUS
LDLR, ASN543HIS AND 9-BP DEL

During a survey of mutations of the LDL receptor gene in Danish patients
with familial hypercholesterolemia (143890), using SSCP analysis, Jensen
et al. (1997) observed different patterns in exons 11 and 17 from 2
apparently unrelated FH index cases indicating the presence of 2
different mutations. No other mutations were identified by analysis of
the remaining 16 exons and the promoter region. The mutation in exon 11
was found to be a 1690A-C transversion, causing an N543H amino acid
substitution. In exon 17, they identified a 9-bp deletion of nucleotides
2393-2405 (2393del9). This sequence contains a 4-bp repeat of the
nucleotides TCCT at the end. It was therefore likely that the 9-bp
deletion had occurred due to 'slipped mispairing mutagenesis,' involving
mispairing of the 4-bp repeat during replication. The deletion did not
cause a frameshift, and the mutant allele coded, therefore, for an LDL
receptor protein lacking 3 amino acids in the membrane-spanning domain:
leu778, val779, and phe780. The 2 mutations were in the same allele of
the LDLR gene. Each of these mutations alone had little or no effect on
receptor function in transfected COS cells, but when both mutations were
present simultaneously, receptor function, as assessed by flow
cytometric measurement of fluorescent LDL uptake in cells, was reduced
by 75%. Immunostainable receptors on the cell surface were decreased by
80% as measured by flow cytometry. The 2 mutations therefore acted in
synergy to affect receptor function, possibly during intracellular
receptor transport, since Northern blot analysis suggested that mRNA
levels were unaffected. Jensen et al. (1997) noted that double mutations
had been reported in several clinically relevant genes, such as the HEXA
gene (606869.0036) and the CFTR gene (602421) (Savov et al., 1995). In
most of these disorders, one mutation was found to be causative, and the
other modified the onset or severity of the disease. The common
methionine-valine polymorphism in the PRNP gene (176640.0005) modifies
both qualitatively and quantitatively the phenotypic expression of the
pathogenic D178N mutation (176640.0010) resulting in 2 different
disorders: fatal familial insomnia and familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease (Goldfarb et al., 1992). Jensen et al. (1997) stated that in the
case of the LDLR double mutant, there appeared to be a true synergistic
action.

.0056
FH ICELAND
LDLR, IVS4, T-C, +2

Gudnason et al. (1997) stated that haplotype analysis in 18 apparently
unrelated families with FH (143890) in Iceland has identified at least 5
different chromosomes cosegregating with hypercholesterolemia. The most
common haplotype was identified in 11 of the 18 families, indicating a
founder mutation. By using SSCP analysis and direct sequencing of
amplified DNA, Gudnason et al. (1997) identified a T-to-C transition in
the second nucleotide in the 5-prime part of intron 4 of the LDLR gene.
This mutation was present in 10 of the 18 families. In half of the
cases, these families could be traced to a common ancestor by going back
no further than the 18th century. The mutation was predicted to affect
correct splicing of exon 4, and analysis at the cellular level
demonstrated an abnormal mRNA containing intron 4 sequence in
lymphoblastoid cells from a patient carrying the mutation. Translation
of the mRNA would lead to a premature stop codon and a truncated
nonfunctional protein of 285 amino acids.

.0058
FH GLASCO
LDLR, CYS163TYR

Lee et al. (1998) reported that in the West of Scotland, in the Glasco
area, about half of the index cases of familial hypercholesterolemia
(143890) were found to have the cys163-to-tyr mutation of the LDLR gene.

.0059
HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA, FAMILIAL
LDLR, CYS240PHE

In a 13-year-old girl with severe hypercholesterolemia (143890), Ekstrom
et al. (1999) demonstrated compound heterozygosity for a cys240-to-phe
mutation and a tyr167-to-ter mutation (606945.0045) in the LDLR gene.
Fibroblasts from the patient showed very low cholesterol esterification
rate, LDL uptake, and degradation as compared to normal fibroblasts. Her
2 heterozygous sibs also carried the C240F mutation, but only one of
them was hypercholesterolemic. Ekstrom et al. (1999) expressed the C240F
mutant in LDLR-deficient CHOldlA7 cells. The transfected cells produced
a detectable protein but were unable to mediate uptake or degradation of
LDL. The authors concluded that there may be cholesterol-lowering
mechanisms that can be activated, perhaps by mutations in known or
hitherto unknown genes.

.0060
HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA, FAMILIAL
LDLR, TRP23TER

In patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (143890), Hobbs et al.
(1992) identified a trp23-to-ter mutation in the LDLR gene.

.0061
HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA, FAMILIAL
LDLR, CYS25SER

In a Japanese patient with familial hypercholesterolemia (143890),
Takahashi et al. (2001) identified a G-to-C transversion at nucleotide
137 of the LDLR gene, resulting in a cys25-to-ser (C25S) amino acid
substitution in the ligand-binding site (mutation class 2B: slow
transport and processing). The patient first noticed xanthomas on both
elbows at the age of 5 years. These continued to increase in number and
size. At age 40 years, xanthomas were present on elbows, palms, knees,
and feet. Clinical manifestations of myocardial ischemia developed at
age 41. Selective LDL filtration was initiated after plasma apheresis
through a macromolecular exclusion filter. With bimonthly treatments,
her LDL cholesterol decreased by approximately 50% and the xanthomas
regressed markedly, almost disappearing with 5 years of treatment.

.0062
HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA, FAMILIAL
LDLR, CYS88SER

Pisciotta et al. (2002) identified a de novo LDLR mutation in a
47-year-old white male who at the age of 43 had suffered a myocardial
infarction. He was heterozygous for a G-to-C transversion in exon 4,
which resulted in a serine for cysteine substitution at position 88
(C88S) of the receptor protein. The mutation was not found in his
parents (nonpaternity was excluded), but it was present in his
9-year-old son, who had familial hypercholesterolemia (143890).
Haplotype analysis indicated that this de novo mutation occurred in the
paternal germline.

.0063
HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA, FAMILIAL
LDLR, IVS14, G-A, +1

Takada et al. (2002) described a novel splice site mutation in the LDLR
gene, IVS14+1G-A, which genealogic research confirmed was shared by 14
of 1,135 members of an American Caucasian pedigree descended from a
common ancestor and affected with familial hypercholesterolemia
(143890). The mutation resulted in an abruptly truncated LDLR protein,
reducing functional LDLR activity by half in heterozygous carriers of
the mutant allele. Takada et al. (2002) stated this was the largest
familial hypercholesterolemia kindred described, and of 208 members
screened for this LDLR mutation, 94 carriers and 114 noncarriers were
identified. Strikingly lower total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol
values were observed among most of the LDLR mutation carriers who were
simultaneously homozygous for the -265C allele of the -265C-T
polymorphism of the APOA2 gene (107670.0002). In vitro transfection
assays showed that transcriptional activity of the APOA2 promoter was
reduced by 30% in the -265C allele as compared with the -265T allele.
The variant of the APOA2 gene was associated with reduced plasma LDL
cholesterol only in familial hypercholesterolemia patients.

In the same large family reported by Takada et al. (2002), Takada et al.
(2003) found that a SNP in the growth hormone receptor gene (GHR),
resulting in a L526I (600946.0028) substitution, influenced plasma
levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in affected family
members with the LDLR mutation. The lowest levels of plasma HDL were
observed among leu/leu homozygotes, highest levels among ile/ile
homozygotes, and intermediate levels among leu/ile heterozygotes. No
such effect was observed among noncarriers of the LDLR mutation.

In the pedigree reported by Takada et al. (2002), Sato et al. (2004)
demonstrated a significant modification of the phenotype of familial
hypercholesterolemia resulting from the IVS14+1G-A mutation by the
arg287 variation in the EPHX2 gene (132811.0001).

.0064
FH PYRGOS
LDLR, -45T DEL

In a patient with familial hypercholesterolemia (143890), Dedoussis et
al. (2003) identified a novel mutation in repeat 3 of the LDLR gene
promoter, -45delT. Analysis of a neutral polymorphism in LDLR mRNA from
the patient's white blood cells showed that the expression of 1 allele
was significantly reduced, and cells had only 24% of LDLR activity by
binding and uptake of iodine-labeled LDL. Transient transfection studies
using a luciferase gene reporter revealed that the -45delT mutation
considerably reduced the transcriptional activity of the LDLR promoter
and strongly suggested that the mutation was the cause of the familial
hypercholesterolemia phenotype. The proband was a female in her late
thirties; her father was reported to have elevated cholesterol levels
and had undergone bypass surgery at the age of 70.

.0065
HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA, FAMILIAL
LDLR, ARG385ARG

In a patient diagnosed with probable heterozygous familial
hypercholesterolemia (143890), who had tendinous xanthomas and angina
since the age of 29 years, Bourbon et al. (2007) identified
heterozygosity for a 1216C-A transversion in exon 9 of the LDLR gene,
resulting in a synonymous arg385-to-arg (R385R) change. However,
analysis of mRNA from the patient's cells showed that the mutation
introduces a new 5-prime acceptor splice site that is used to the
exclusion of the natural splice site and causes a 31-bp deletion
predicted to result in premature termination 4 codons beyond the change.
Review of previous LDLR gene sequencing data revealed that the same base
substitution was present in a Chinese homozygous FH patient in whom no
other mutation in LDLR had been found. The authors stated that the
difference in origins of the 2 patients suggested that the mutation was
very unlikely to have been inherited from a common ancestor and that it
might be present in other populations as well.

Defesche et al. (2008) analyzed the LDLR gene in 1,350 patients
clinically diagnosed with familial hypercholesterolemia who were
negative for functional DNA variation in known hypercholesterolemia
genes and identified the R385R variant in 2 probands, both of Chinese
origin, and their family members. In view of the faint band representing
the aberrantly spliced mRNA on gel electrophoresis, the authors
suggested that this DNA variant likely leads to nonsense-mediated mRNA
decay.

.0066
HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA, FAMILIAL
LDLR, GLY186GLY

In 35 unrelated Dutch patients clinically diagnosed with familial
hypercholesterolemia who were negative for functional DNA variation in
known hypercholesterolemia genes, Defesche et al. (2008) identified a
621C-T transition in exon 4 of the LDLR gene, resulting in a synonymous
gly186-to-gly (G186G) change, that introduces a 3-prime splice donor
site with a higher 'probability score' than the naturally occurring
3-prime splice site 75 bp downstream. Analysis of cDNA synthesized from
total RNA revealed that the aberrant splicing results in a 75-bp
in-frame deletion and a stable mRNA, predicted to produce an LDLR
protein lacking a 25-amino acid fragment (gly186 to cys210). The variant
was found in homozygosity in 2 of the probands, who had LDL cholesterol
levels of 14.8 and 10.5 mmol/L, respectively, and who both suffered
myocardial infarctions before the age of 20 years. The variant was also
identified in 62 first-degree relatives of the index cases.

.0067
HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA, FAMILIAL
LDLR, IVS14, C-G, +86

In a proband with clinically defined hypercholesterolemia (143890),
Kulseth et al. (2010) identified heterozygosity for a splice site
mutation (2140+86C-G) in intron 14 of the LDLR gene, activating a
cryptic splice site that results in aberrantly spliced mRNA containing
an 81-bp insertion. Twelve of 23 family members tested were heterozygous
for the mutation, and carriers had significantly increased total
cholesterol levels compared to noncarriers. The 2140+86C-G mutation was
found in 3 additional probands with hypercholesterolemia, and in 1
proband's family the mutation was found in 6 of 7 tested family members,
who all had LDL cholesterol levels above the 97th percentile. RT-PCR
analysis in 1 affected individual from that family showed that the
mutant allele mainly gave rise to aberrantly spliced mRNA, but
contributed 21% normal transcripts. Transfection studies in CHO cells
demonstrated retention of mutant LDLR in the endoplasmic reticulum,
presumably due to protein misfolding.

;;DNA POLYMERASE, DELTA 2, SMALL SUBUNIT
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The DNA polymerase delta complex is involved in DNA replication and
repair, and it consists of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA;
176740), the multisubunit replication factor C (see 102579), and the 4
subunit polymerase complex: POLD1 (174761), POLD2, POLD3 (611415), and
POLD4 (611525) (Liu and Warbrick, 2006).

CLONING

Zhang et al. (1995) cloned and sequenced full-length cDNAs of bovine and
human POLD2. The predicted bovine and human polypeptides of 50.9 and
51.3 kD, respectively, are 94% identical, similar to the identity of the
bovine and human catalytic POLD1 subunits. The high degree of
conservation of the polypeptides suggested an essential function for the
small subunit in the heterodimeric core enzyme. Searches of protein
databases failed to detect significant homology with any protein
sequenced to that point.

MAPPING

By PCR analysis of DNA from a panel of human/hamster hybrid cell lines,
Zhang et al. (1995) mapped the POLD2 gene to chromosome 7.

;;GIBBON APE LEUKEMIA VIRUS RECEPTOR 1; GLVR1;;
PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER 1; PIT1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Retrovirus receptors allow infection of human and murine cells by
various retroviruses. The receptors that have been identified at the
molecular level include CD4 (186940) for human immunodeficiency virus,
Rec1 for murine ecotropic virus, and GLVR1 for gibbon ape leukemia virus
(see 182090). These 3 proteins show no homology to one another at the
DNA or protein level. GLVR1 is a sodium-dependent phosphate symporter
(summary by Kaelbling et al., 1991).

CLONING

Ohara et al. (1990) transfected human DNA into mouse cells and assayed
for transcripts that conferred sensitivity to infection by GALV. They
cloned a cDNA that predicted a 679-amino acid integral membrane protein
containing multiple transmembrane domains.

GENE FUNCTION

By expression in Xenopus oocytes and in mammalian cells, Kavanaugh et
al. (1994) determined that GLVR1 is a sodium-dependent phosphate
symporter. Voltage-clamp analysis indicated net cation influx,
suggesting that phosphate is transported with excess sodium ions.

GENE STRUCTURE

Palmer et al. (1999) showed that the GLVR1 gene consists of 11 exons
spanning approximately 18 kb of genomic DNA. Exon 1 is noncoding.

Using a luciferase reporter gene assay in transiently transfected
chondrocytes and osteoblasts, Palmer et al. (2001) determined that the
activity of the promoter of SLC20A1, which they called PIT1, requires a
TATA-like sequence and a single SP1 (189906) site. They found that this
SP1 site could bind SP1 and SP3 (601804). Despite the conservation of
sequence between the human and mouse promoter, the promoter of mouse
Pit1 depends on a combination of several cis-acting elements.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization and somatic cell hybrid analysis, Kaelbling et
al. (1991) mapped the GLVR1 gene to 2q11-q14. Glvr1 was mapped in the
mouse to chromosome 2 in a region of linkage conservation with human
chromosome 2. This mouse chromosome carries Rec2, the likely receptor
for M813, a retrovirus derived from a feral Asian mouse. The findings
raise the interesting possibility that Rec2 and Glvr1 are structurally
related.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The DYRK1A gene encodes a member of the dual-specificity tyrosine
phosphorylation-regulated kinase (DYRK) family and participates in
various cellular processes. It is a highly conserved gene located in the
so-called Down Syndrome critical region (DSCR), a part of chromosome 21
that is responsible for the majority of phenotypic features in Down
syndrome (190685) (summary by van Bon et al., 2011).

CLONING

In the course of cloning transcripts from the region of human chromosome
21 that is homologous to the region of mouse chromosome 16 containing
the 'weaver' (wv) locus (see 600877), Patil et al. (1995) identified a
gene that encodes a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase. The
closest relative of this kinase was found to be the Drosophila
'minibrain' gene (mnb) (Tejedor et al., 1995).

Shindoh et al. (1996) performed exon trapping to find exons within YAC
clones spanning the 2-Mb Down syndrome critical region of human
chromosome 21. Of more than 160 exons isolated, they found 6 that had
significant identity at the amino acid level to the Drosophila
'minibrain' gene. Using 1 of these exons as a probe, they cloned the
full-length human cDNA from a human fetal brain cDNA library. Sequence
analysis of this cDNA revealed an open reading frame encoding a
polypeptide of 754 amino acids. Shindoh et al. (1996) stated that this
gene, termed MNB by them, represents the human homolog of the Drosophila
mnb gene and of the rat Dyrk gene. The rat Dyrk gene differs from it by
only 4 amino acids. Northern blot analysis of MNB revealed 2 transcripts
of 6.0 and 7.5 kb. The 6.0-kb transcript was found to be present in all
tissues examined, with highest levels of expression in skeletal muscle,
testis, fetal lung, and fetal kidney. The 7.5-kb transcript was found to
be expressed at a relatively lower level and was found only in adult
heart, placenta, spleen, and testis. Shindoh et al. (1996) concluded
that the human MNB protein may play a significant role in a signaling
pathway regulating cell proliferation and may be involved in normal
brain development and in the pathogenesis of Down syndrome.

Song et al. (1996) cloned the DYRK gene and its murine counterpart
(Dyrk) and compared it to the rat Dyrk gene. The 3 mammalian genes are
highly conserved, being more than 99% identical at the protein level
over their 763-amino acid open reading frame; in addition, the mammalian
genes are 83% identical over 414 amino acids to the smaller 542-amino
acid mnb protein of Drosophila. The predicted human and murine proteins
both contain a nuclear targeting signal sequence, a protein kinase
domain, a putative leucine zipper motif, and a highly conservative
13-consecutive-histidine repeat. Northern blot analysis indicated that
both human and murine genes encode approximately 6-kb transcripts. PCR
screening of cDNA libraries derived from various human and murine
tissues indicated that DYRK and Dyrk are expressed both during
development and in the adult. In situ hybridization of Dyrk to mouse
embryos (days 13, 15, and 17 postcoitus) indicated a differential
spatial and temporal pattern of expression, with the most abundant
signal localized in brain matter, spinal cord, and retina. The observed
expression pattern was coincident with many of the clinical findings in
trisomy 21.

Song et al. (1997) found that mouse Dyrk is expressed in frontal brain
nuclei during mouse embryogenesis and that it interacts with other
proteins. The chromosomal locus of DYRK, its homology to the mnb gene,
and the in situ hybridization expression patterns of murine Dyrk,
combined with the fact that transgenic mice for a YAC to which Dyrk maps
are mentally deficient, suggested to Song et al. (1996) that DYRK may be
involved in the abnormal neurogenesis found in Down syndrome. They
considered DYRK a good candidate to mediate some of the pleiotropic
effects of Down syndrome.

Chen and Antonarakis (1997) used exon trapping to identify human
chromosome 21-encoded genes and identified in this way the homolog of
the Drosophila mnb gene. By Northern analysis they found high expression
levels of a 6.8-kb RNA transcript in adult heart, brain, placenta, and
skeletal muscle, and in fetal lung, liver, and kidney.

Using a combination of cDNA library screening and RACE, Guimera et al.
(1999) identified 2 transcription start sites, resulting in MNBHa and
MNBHb transcripts. Northern blot analysis of multiple tissues using a
probe specific to MNBHa revealed ubiquitous expression, while a probe
specific to MNBHb revealed expression only in heart and skeletal muscle.
Guimera et al. (1999) also identified at least 4 protein isoforms
arising from alternative splicing of the C terminus. All isoforms
contain a PEST sequence, which potentially directs rapid degradation of
the protein. The most abundant transcript in brain produces the largest
isoform (isoform-1), a 763-amino acid protein with a calculated
molecular mass of about 85.6 kD. This isoform also contains a histidine
repeat and a serine/threonine domain not found in the other isoforms.
Guimera et al. (1999) determined that the MNBH variant reported by
Shindoh et al. (1996) is 9 amino acids shorter than isoform-1 near the N
terminus and results from the use of an alternative splice acceptor
site.

GENE STRUCTURE

Guimera et al. (1999) determined that the MNBH gene contains 17
alternatively spliced exons and spans 150 kb. The 5-prime untranslated
region contains 2 separate promoters. One promoter, utilized by the
MNBHa variant, contains a GC-rich element and no canonic TATA or CAAT
boxes. The other, utilized by MNBHb, contains a CAAT box and a
nonconsensus AT-rich motif.

MAPPING

Using fluorescence in situ hybridization and regional mapping data, Song
et al. (1996) localized the DYRK gene between markers D21S336 and
D21S337 in the 21q22.2 region. With amplification by PCR and
hybridization analysis, Chen and Antonarakis (1997) mapped the human MNB
gene on YACs located on 21q22.2.

Song et al. (1997) mapped the murine Dyrk gene to distal mouse
chromosome 16, in agreement with the mapping of human DYRK to a syntenic
region of chromosome 21.

GENE FUNCTION

Kelly and Rahmani (2005) found that overexpression of human DYRK1A in
PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells potentiated their neuronal
differentiation in response to nerve growth factor (see NGFB; 162030).
Differentiation required upregulation of the Ras (HRAS; 190020)/MAP
kinase (see MAPK1; 176948) signaling pathway, but was independent of
DYRK1A kinase activity. DYRK1A prolonged Erk (see MAPK3; 601795)
activation by interacting with Ras, Braf (164757), and Mek1 (MAP2K1;
176872) to facilitate formation of a Ras/Braf/Mek1 multiprotein complex.

Using rat hippocampal and mouse neoblastoma cell lines, Kim et al.
(2006) found that Dyrk1a interacted with alpha-synuclein (SNCA; 163890),
a component of Lewy bodies, one of the pathologic hallmarks of Parkinson
disease (168600), Alzheimer disease (104300), and Lewy-body dementia
(127750). Dyrk1a serine phosphorylated alpha-synuclein, and this
phosphorylation facilitated its intracytoplasmic aggregation.

Arron et al. (2006) reported that 2 genes, DSCR1 (RCAN1; 602917) and
DYRK1A, that lie within the Down syndrome (190685) critical region of
human chromosome 21 act synergistically to prevent nuclear occupancy of
NFATc transcription factors (see 600489), which are regulators of
vertebrate development. Arron et al. (2006) used mathematical modeling
to predict that autoregulation within the pathway accentuates the
effects of trisomy of DSCR1 and DYRK1A, leading to failure to activate
NFATc target genes under specific conditions. The authors' observations
of calcineurin (see 114105)- and Nfatc-deficient mice, Dscr1- and
Dyrk1a-overexpressing mice, mouse models of Down syndrome, and human
trisomy 21 were consistent with these predictions. Arron et al. (2006)
suggested that the 1.5-fold increase in dosage of DSCR1 and DYRK1A
cooperatively destabilizes a regulatory circuit, leading to reduced
NFATc activity and many of the features of Down syndrome. Arron et al.
(2006) concluded that more generally, their observations suggest that
the destabilization of regulatory circuits can underlie human disease.

In resting cells, NFAT proteins are heavily phosphorylated and reside in
the cytoplasm; in cells exposed to stimuli that raise intracellular free
calcium ion levels, they are dephosphorylated by the calmodulin
(114180)-dependent phosphatase calcineurin and translocate to the
nucleus. NFAT dephosphorylation by calcineurin is countered by distinct
NFAT kinases, among them casein kinase-1 (CK1; 600505), and glycogen
synthase kinase-3 (GSK3; see 605004). Gwack et al. (2006) used a
genomewide RNA interference screen in Drosophila to identify additional
regulators of the signaling pathway leading from calcium ion-calcineurin
to NFAT. This screen was successful because the pathways regulating NFAT
subcellular localization (calcium ion influx, calcium
ion-calmodulin-calcineurin signaling, and NFAT kinases) are conserved
across species, even though calcium ion-regulated NFAT proteins are not
themselves represented in invertebrates. Using the screen, Gwack et al.
(2006) identified DYRKs as novel regulators of NFAT. DYRK1A and DYRK2
(603496) counter calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation of NFAT1 by
directly phosphorylating the conserved serine-proline repeat 3 (SP3)
motif of the NFAT regulatory domain, thus priming further
phosphorylation of the SP2 and serine-rich region 1 (SRR1) motifs by
GSK3 and CK1, respectively. Thus, Gwack et al. (2006) concluded that
genetic screening in Drosophila can be successfully applied to cross
evolutionary boundaries and identify new regulators of a transcription
factor that is expressed only in vertebrates.

Ryoo et al. (2007) showed that mice overexpressing human DYRK1A had
elevated levels of threonine-phosphorylated tau (MAPT; 157140), which is
found in insoluble neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer disease brains.
DYRK1A phosphorylated tau on threonine and serine residues in vitro.
Phosphorylation of tau by DYRK1A reduced the ability of tau to promote
microtubule assembly. Ryoo et al. (2007) concluded that an extra copy of
DYRK1A can contribute to early onset of Alzheimer disease.

Using a transchromosomic mouse model of Down syndrome, Canzonetta et al.
(2008) showed that a 30 to 60% reduced expression of NRSF/REST (600571),
a key regulator of pluripotency and neuronal differentiation, is an
alteration that persists in trisomy 21 from undifferentiated embryonic
stem cells to adult brain and is reproducible across several Down
syndrome models. Using partially trisomic embryonic stem (ES) cells,
Canzonetta et al. (2008) mapped this effect to a 3-gene segment of human
chromosome 21 containing DYRK1A. The authors independently identified
the same locus as the most significant expression quantitative trait
locus (eQTL) controlling REST expression in the human genome. Canzonetta
et al. (2008) found that specifically silencing the third copy of DYRK1A
rescued Rest levels, and demonstrated altered Rest expression in
response to inhibition of DYRK1A expression or kinase activity, and in a
transgenic Dyrk1a mouse. The authors observed that undifferentiated
trisomy 21 ES cells showed DYRK1A-dose-sensitive reductions in levels of
some pluripotency regulators, including Nanog (607937) and Sox2
(184429), causing premature expression of transcription factors driving
early endodermal and mesodermal differentiation, partially overlapping
downstream effects of Rest heterozygosity. The ES cells produced
embryoid bodies with elevated levels of the primitive endoderm
progenitor marker Gata4 (600576) and a strongly reduced neuroectodermal
progenitor compartment. Canzonetta et al. (2008) concluded that
DYRK1A-mediated deregulation of REST is a very early pathologic
consequence of trisomy 21 with potential to disturb the development of
all embryonic lineages, warranting closer research into its contribution
to Down syndrome pathology and new rationales for therapeutic
approaches.

By varying Dyrk1a gene dosage in mice, Laguna et al. (2008) showed that
variations in Dyrk1a expression in retina led to a dose-dependent
increase in retinal inner cell number and altered retinal activity.
Inner retinal cells were generated normally in mice under- or
overexpressing Dyrk1a; however, overexpression of Dyrk1a resulted in
inhibitory threonine phosphorylation of caspase-9 (CASP9; 602234),
leading to reduced apoptosis and increased cell number.

Baek et al. (2009) demonstrated that DSCR1 expression is increased in
Down syndrome tissues and in a mouse model of Down syndrome.
Furthermore, the modest increase in expression afforded by a single
extra transgenic copy of Dscr1 in mice is sufficient to confer
significant suppression of tumor growth, and such resistance is a
consequence of a deficit in tumor angiogenesis arising from suppression
of the calcineurin pathway. Baek et al. (2009) also provided evidence
that attenuation of calcineurin activity by DSCR1, together with another
chromosome 21 gene Dyrk1a, may be sufficient to markedly diminish
angiogenesis. Baek et al. (2009) concluded that their data provided a
mechanism for the reduced cancer incidence of Down syndrome and
identified the calcineurin signaling pathway, and its regulators DSCR1
and DYRK1A, as potential therapeutic targets in cancer arising in all
individuals.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a woman with autosomal dominant mental retardation-7 (MRD7; 614104),
microcephaly, and dysmorphic features, van Bon et al. (2011) identified
a de novo heterozygous 52-kb deletion in the DYRK1A gene (600855.0001).
This patient was identified among a larger group of 3,009 mentally
retarded individuals studied for copy number variations in the DYRK1A
gene. The report supported a role for DYRK1A in human brain development
and showed that haploinsufficiency of DYRK1A can cause a distinctive
clinical syndrome with mental retardation, primary microcephaly,
intrauterine growth retardation, facial dysmorphism, impaired motor
functioning, and behavioral problems.

O'Roak et al. (2012) identified 3 de novo mutations in DYRK1A, 2
frameshift and 1 splice site mutation (600855.0002-600855.0004), among
44 candidate gene sequences in 2,446 autism spectrum disorder probands.
The 3 patients with DYRK1A mutations had microcephaly relative to
individuals screened without DYRK1A mutations (2-sample permutation
test, 2-sided p = 0.0005), and the head sizes of these patients was
smaller than those of their parents.

CYTOGENETICS

Moller et al. (2008) reported 2 unrelated patients with microcephaly,
intrauterine growth retardation, postnatal feeding difficulties, and
dysmorphic facial features (see 614104) who each had a de novo balanced
translocation disrupting the DYRK1A gene: t(9;21)(p12;q22) and
t(2;21)(q22;q22), respectively. In the second patient, the 2q22
breakpoint was within intron 39 of the LRP1B (608766) gene. The first
child, 24 months old at the time of the report, had large low-set ears,
long philtrum, micrognathia, hypogenesis of the corpus callosum, mild
developmental delay, and febrile seizures. The second child, age 10
years, had large ears, flat philtrum, asymmetric head, febrile seizures,
severe mental retardation, no speech development, and a small
ventricular septal defect. Moller et al. (2008) noted the phenotypic
similarities to patients with partial monosomy 21 (Matsumoto et al.,
1997) and suggested that haploinsufficiency of the DYRK1A gene results
in microcephaly as well as other neurodevelopmental anomalies. Van Bon
et al. (2011) noted that their patient clearly resembles the 2 patients
reported by Moller et al. (2008).

Courcet et al. (2012) reported a 4-year-old child with poor growth,
microcephaly (-6 SD), severe mental retardation, seizures, facial
dysmorphism, and behavioral abnormalities associated with a de novo
heterozygous 69-kb deletion of chromosome 21q22.13 including the 5-prime
region of the DYRK1A gene. She had feeding difficulties in infancy,
hypotonia, delayed walking, and delayed speech. Facial features included
thick lips, bulbous nose, mild hypotelorism, micrognathia, prominent
incisors, and large ears with a thick helix. Brain MRI was normal.

EVOLUTION

Green et al. (2010) published a draft sequence of the Neandertal genome.
Comparisons of the Neandertal genome to the genomes of 5 present-day
humans from different parts of the world identified a number of genomic
regions that may have been affected by positive selection in ancestral
modern humans, including genes involved in metabolism and in cognitive
and skeletal development. Green et al. (2010) identified a total of 212
regions containing putative selective sweeps. Mutations in several genes
in regions of selective sweeps, including DYRK1A, NRG3 (605533), CADPS2
(609978), and AUTS2 (607270), have been associated with disorders
affecting cognitive capacities. Green et al. (2010) hypothesized that
multiple genes involved in cognitive development were positively
selected during the early history of modern humans. Green et al. (2010)
also showed that Neandertals shared more genetic variants with
present-day humans in Eurasia than with present-day humans in
sub-Saharan Africa, suggesting that gene flow from Neandertals into the
ancestors of non-Africans occurred before the divergence of Eurasian
groups from each other.

OTHER FEATURES

Jiang et al. (2013) tested the concept that a gene imbalance across an
extra chromosome can be de facto corrected by manipulating a single
gene, X inactivation-specific transcript (XIST; 314670). Using genome
editing with zinc finger nucleases, Jiang et al. (2013) inserted a large
inducible XIST transgene into the DYRK1A locus on chromosome 21 in Down
syndrome pluripotent stem cells. The XIST noncoding RNA coats chromosome
21 and triggers stable heterochromatin modifications, chromosomewide
transcriptional silencing, and DNA methylation to form a 'chromosome 21
Barr body.' This provided a model to study human chromosome inactivation
and created a system to investigate genomic expression changes and
cellular pathologies of trisomy 21, free from genetic and epigenetic
noise. Notably, deficits in proliferation and neural rosette formation
are rapidly reversed upon silencing 1 chromosome 21. Jiang et al. (2013)
suggested that their successful trisomy silencing in vitro surmounted
the major first step towards potential development of chromosome
therapy.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using Down syndrome as a model for complex trait analysis, Smith et al.
(1997) sought to identify loci from 21q22.2 which, when present in an
extra dose, contribute to learning abnormalities. They generated
low-copy number transgenic mice, containing 4 different YACs that
together cover approximately 2 Mb of contiguous DNA from 21q22.2. They
subjected independent mouse lines derived from each of these YAC
transgenes to a series of behavioral and learning assays. Two of the 4
YACs caused defects in learning and memory in the transgenic animals,
while the other 2 YACs had no effect. The most severe defects were
caused by a 570-kb YAC; the interval responsible for these defects was
narrowed to a 180-kb critical region as a consequence of YAC
fragmentation. This region was found to contain the human homolog of the
Drosophila 'minibrain' gene, and strongly implicated it in learning
defects associated with Down syndrome.

Altafaj et al. (2001) generated transgenic mice overexpressing the
full-length cDNA of Dyrk1A. Dyrk1A mice exhibited delayed craniocaudal
maturation with functional consequences in neuromotor development.
Dyrk1A mice also showed altered motor skill acquisition and
hyperactivity, which was maintained to adulthood. In the Morris water
maze, Dyrk1A mice showed a significant impairment in spatial learning
and cognitive flexibility, indicative of hippocampal and prefrontal
cortex dysfunction. In the more complex repeated reversal learning
paradigm, this defect was specifically related to reference memory,
whereas working memory was almost unimpaired. Altafaj et al. (2001)
suggested a causative role of DYRK1A in mental retardation and in motor
anomalies of Down syndrome.

By gene targeting, Fotaki et al. (2002) created Dyrk1a-null mice.
Homozygous null mutants presented a general growth delay and died during
midgestation. Heterozygous mice showed decreased neonatal viability and
reduced body size from birth to adulthood. General neurobehavioral
analysis revealed preweaning developmental delay in heterozygous mice
and specific alterations in adults. Brains of heterozygous mice were
decreased in size in a region-specific manner, although the
cytoarchitecture and neuronal components in most areas were not altered.
Cell counts showed increased neuronal densities in some brain regions
and a specific decrease in the number of neurons in the superior
colliculus, which exhibited a significant size reduction.

Using an adeno-associated virus construct that included a small hairpin
RNA directed against Dyrk1a, Ortiz-Abalia et al. (2008) downregulated
expression of Dyrk1a in transgenic mice overexpressing Dyrk1a as a Down
syndrome model. The treatment was devoid of toxicity and normalized
Dyrk1a protein levels. Importantly, downregulation of Dyrk1a reversed
the corticostriatal-dependent phenotype, as shown by attenuation of
hyperactive behavior, restoration of motor-coordination defects, and
improved sensorimotor gating.

Lepagnol-Bestel et al. (2009) used the transgenic 152F7 mouse mouse
model of Down syndrome to show that DYRK1A gene dosage imbalance
deregulated chromosomal clusters of genes located near REST REST/NRSF
(600571) binding sites. Dyrk1a bound the SWI/SNF complex, which is known
to interact with REST/NRSF. Mutation of a REST/NRSF binding site in the
promoter of the REST/NRSF target gene L1cam (308840) modified the
transcriptional effect of Dyrk1a-dosage imbalance on L1cam. Dyrk1a
dosage imbalance perturbed Rest/Nrsf levels with decreased Rest/Nrsf
expression in embryonic neurons and increased expression in adult
neurons. In transgenic embryonic brain subregions, the authors
identified a coordinated deregulation of multiple genes that responsible
for dendritic growth impairment. Similarly, Dyrk1a overexpression in
primary mouse cortical neurons induced severe reduction of the dendritic
growth and dendritic complexity. Lepagnol-Bestel et al. (2009) proposed
that both the DYRK1A overexpression-related neuronal gene deregulation
(via disturbance of REST/NRSF levels) and the REST/NRSF-SWI/SNF
chromatin remodeling complex significantly contribute to the neural
phenotypic changes that characterize Down syndrome.

MENTAL RETARDATION, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT 7
DYRK1A, 52-KB DEL

In a woman with mental retardation-7 (MRD7; 614104), microcephaly, and
dysmorphic features, van Bon et al. (2011) identified a de novo
heterozygous 52-kb deletion (Chr21: 37,796,500 to 37,849,000 NCBI 36) of
the DYRK1A gene, affecting the last 3 exons. As an infant, she had
failure to thrive, abnormal movements, hypoactivity, and febrile
seizures. Brain MRI at age 25 showed a mildly atrophic brain without
structural abnormalities. Dysmorphic features included bitemporal
narrowing, deep-set eyes, large simple ears, and a pointed nasal tip.
This patient was identified among a larger group of 3,009 mentally
retarded individuals studied for copy number variations in the DYRK1A
gene.

DYRK1A, 2-BP DEL, AT

In a 96-month-old non-Hispanic white male diagnosed with autism and
mental retardation (MRD7; 614104), O'Roak et al. (2012) identified a de
novo heterozygous 2-basepair deletion in the DYRK1A gene that resulted
in a frameshift and premature termination of the protein (Ile48LysfsX2).
The patient's verbal IQ was 63; nonverbal IQ, 55; and low adaptive
score, 74. He had polydactly and had been hypotonic and lethargic as an
infant. He was diagnosed with mild mental retardation and found to be
excessively clumsy and uncoordinated. His head circumference was 47.6 cm
(z score = -3.8). The patient's father and mother were 55 and 39 years
of age, respectively, at the time of his conception. His 13-year-old
brother was healthy with a normal head circumference.

In a 13-year-old non-Hispanic white female with autism and severe mental
retardation (MRD7; 614104), O'Roak et al. (2012) identified a
heterozygous de novo splice site mutation in the DYRK1A gene, a G-to-A
transition at the 1098+1 position (1098G-A+1). The mutation occurs in
the serine/threonine kinase domain. The patient's verbal IQ was 26,
nonverbal IQ 42, and adaptive score 41. MRI was normal, but EEG results
were unclear. The patient's head circumference was 51.5 cm (z score =
-1.6). Her father was 37 at the time of conception and had some evidence
of broader autism phenotype with elevated rigid and aloof behaviors.

deletion in the DYRK1A gene that resulted in a frameshift and premature
termination of the protein (Ala498ProfsX94). The patient had a verbal IQ
of 91, nonverbal IQ of 66, and adaptive score of 68. He had a history of
speech delay and seizures both febrile and nonfebrile, and had ADHD. His
head circumference was 48 cm (z score = -2.7). His father was 37 at the
time of conception; his mother was 36. Both were healthy with normal
head circumferences.

DYRK1A, 2-BP DEL, 290CT

In a 14-year-old girl with severe mental retardation (614104), Courcet
et al. (2012) identified a de novo heterozygous 2-bp deletion
(290_291delCT) in exon 3 of the DYRK1A gene, resulting in a frameshift
and premature truncation (S97Cfs*98). The patient had a history of
intrauterine growth retardation and feeding difficulties. She developed
seizures of multiple types at age 18 months. Other features included
microcephaly (-6 SD), severe speech delay, diffuse cortical atrophy on
MRI, hand stereotypies, and facial dysmorphism with thick lower lip,
mild hypotelorism, and hypoplastic earlobes. This patient was
ascertained from a larger cohort of 150 patients with a similar
phenotype; she was the only one who had a mutation in the DYRK1A gene.

611447	TITLE *611447 Y BOX-BINDING PROTEIN 2; YBX2
;;MSY2;;
CSDA3;;
CONTRIN;;
DNA-BINDING PROTEIN C; DBPC
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

YBX2 is a germ-cell specific member of the vertebrate Y box family of
nucleic acid-binding proteins (Gu et al., 1998; Tekur et al., 1999).

CLONING

By screening human testis cDNA libraries with mouse Ybx2, followed by
rescreening with 5-prime oligonucleotides from positive clones, Tekur et
al. (1999) cloned YBX2, which they called contrin. The deduced 364-amino
acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 38.6 kD and is arginine-
and proline-rich. It shares 69% and 73% amino acid identity with DBPA
(CSDA; 603437) and YB1 (NSEP1; 154030), respectively, and contains an
N-terminal cold-shock domain (CSD), 7 putative phosphorylation sites for
casein kinase II (see CSNK2A1; 115440), 3 potential phosphorylation
sites for protein kinase C, and 2 nuclear localization signals within a
B/A island. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.8-kb transcript in human
testes only. YBX2 shares 93% and 77% amino acid identity with mouse Ybx2
and Xenopus Frgy2, respectively.

Gu et al. (1998) cloned mouse Ybx2, which they called Msy2, and an
alternatively spliced isoform, Msy2a. The deduced 360-amino acid mouse
Msy2 and 282-amino acid Msy2a isoforms have calculated molecular masses
of 38 and 31 kD, respectively. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues
detected Msy2 in mouse germ cells only with expression first detected in
testes from 12-day-old mice, increasing significantly by 17 days, and
reaching maximal levels in 22-day-old mouse testes and persisting into
adulthood. Western blot analysis and immunohistochemical studies
detected Msy2 protein in mouse testes and in diplotene-stage and mature
oocytes. By SDS-PAGE, they showed that mouse Msy2 and Msy2a isoforms
migrated at molecular masses of 52 and 48 kD, respectively. This
disparity in migration relative to its true molecular mass is a feature
shared with other Y box proteins.

Using immunohistochemical studies, Kohno et al. (2006) detected highest
DBPC levels in oocytes, spermatogonia, and spermatocytes with moderate
expression in trophoblasts and low levels in lung, heart, adrenal
cortex, and skeletal muscle. In contrast to the restricted distribution
in normal cells, they found upregulated DBPC levels in a variety of
human carcinomas, including adenocarcinomas of the colon (9/10) and
cholangiocellular carcinomas (8/10). All germ cell tumors tested,
including testicular seminomas and ovarian dysgerminomas, showed high
DBPC levels by immunohistochemical analysis.

MAPPING

By PCR analysis with human-rodent somatic cell hybrids, Tekur et al.
(1999) mapped the YBX2 gene to chromosome 17p13.1-p11.2.

;;SYNCHRONIZED IMPORT PROTEIN 1; SYO1;;
SYMPORTIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Kressler et al. (2012) cloned S. cerevisiae and C. thermophilum Syo1 and
identified orthologs in all other species examined, including human.
Syo1 contains several ARM and HEAT repeats.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Kressler et al. (2012) determined the crystal structure of C.
thermophilum Syo1 at 2.1-angstrom resolution. They found that Syo1
formed an alpha-helical superhelix or alpha-solenoid, typical of nuclear
transport receptors.

GENE FUNCTION

Ribosomal proteins and RNA are assembled into ribosomes in an ordered
manner. Ribosomal proteins are imported into the nucleus via transport
receptors and are released from their transporters by RanGTP (601179).
Using S. cerevisiae and C. thermophilum, Kressler et al. (2012) showed
that Syo1 facilitated synchronized nuclear import of the 5S rRNA (RN5S1;
180420)-binding proteins Rpl5 (603634) and Rpl11 (604175) in a manner
dependent on the import receptor Kap104, an ortholog of human TNPO1
(602901). Binding of RanGTP to Kap104 in the nucleus mediated release of
the Syo1-Rpl5-Rpl11 complex, which recruited 5S RNA.

MAPPING

Gross (2012) mapped the HEATR3 gene to chromosome 16q12.1 based on an
alignment of the HEATR3 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC018730) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

300798	TITLE *300798 PHOSPHORYLASE KINASE, LIVER, ALPHA-2 SUBUNIT; PHKA2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The PHKA2 gene on chromosome Xp22 encodes the alpha subunit of hepatic
phosphorylase kinase (PHK; EC 2.7.11.19). Hepatic phosphorylase kinase
is a hexadecameric enzyme comprising 4 copies each of 4 unique subunits
encoded by 4 different genes: alpha (PHKA2), beta (PHKB, 172490), gamma
(PHKG2, (172471)), and delta. The delta subunit can be encoded by 3
different genes (CALM1, 114180; CALM2, 114182; or CALM3, 114183). The
PHKA1 (311870) and PHKG1 (172470) genes encode the alpha and gamma
subunits, respectively, of muscle phosphorylase kinase; the beta subunit
is the same in both isoforms. The gamma subunits contain the active site
of the enzyme, whereas the alpha and beta subunits have regulatory
functions controlled by phosphorylation. The delta subunit, which
encodes calmodulin, mediates the dependence of the enzyme on calcium
concentration (Beauchamp et al., 2007).

CLONING

Davidson et al. (1992) isolated clones corresponding to the Phka2 gene
from a rabbit cDNA library. The deduced 1,235-residue protein showed 68%
sequence similarity to the rabbit Phka1 gene. The placement of
nucleotide and residue differences indicated that Phka1 and Phka2 are
encoded by 2 separate genes, rather than being generated by alternative
splicing of a single gene. Northern blot analysis identified a 4.3-kb
mRNA Phka2 transcript with high expression in liver and brain, but not
in muscle.

Hendrickx et al. (1992, 1993) isolated a clone for the human PHKA2 gene
from a human hepatoma cDNA library. The protein showed 93.5% homology to
the rabbit protein. Two calmodulin binding sites identified in rabbit
Phka1 are highly conserved in rabbit and human PHKA2. Differential
splicing was observed.

MAPPING

Using the rabbit Phka2 gene, Davidson et al. (1992) mapped the human
homolog, PHKA2, to chromosome Xp22.2-p22.1. By in situ hybridization,
Wauters et al. (1992) demonstrated that the PHKA2 gene is located in the
distal part of Xp in the same region as the mutation for X-linked liver
glycogenosis (GSD IXa; 306000). By fluorescence in situ hybridization,
Hendrickx et al. (1992, 1993) mapped the human PHKA2 gene to Xp22. It is
noteworthy that PHKA1 and PHKA2 are located on Xq and Xp, respectively.

In the mouse, Ryder-Cook et al. (1989) mapped the alpha subunit of
phosphorylase kinase to the X chromosome. They noted that the beta,
gamma, and delta subunits are autosomal.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hendrickx et al. (1999) determined that the human PHKA2 gene contains 33
exons and spans 65 kb or more.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In patients with X-linked hepatic glycogen storage disease (GSD9A; see
306000), Hendrickx et al. (1995) identified 4 different mutations in the
PHKA2 gene (300798.0001-300798.0004).

Van den Berg et al. (1995) identified mutations in the PHKA2 gene
(300798.0005 and 300798.0006) in affected members of 2 Dutch families
with GSD IXa1. One of the families had been reported by Huijing and
Fernandez (1969).

Burwinkel et al. (1996) identified mutations in the PHKA2 gene in
patients with GSD IXa2 (306000.0007-306000.0010). The mutations appeared
to cluster in limited sequence regions. Burwinkel et al. (1996) stressed
that the clustering of GSD IXa2 mutations would further facilitate
analysis by RT-PCR of blood cell mRNA and thus help avoid liver biopsy
in the diagnosis.

In a Japanese boy with classic GSD IXa2, Fukao et al. (2007) identified
a hemizygous 10-kb deletion in the PHKA2 gene, resulting in the deletion
of exons 20 to 26. Studies of the breakpoint regions showed that the
deletion resulted from Alu element-mediated unequal homologous
recombination.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

In 4 unrelated patients with GSD IXa2, Hendrickx et al. (1996)
identified 4 different mutations in the PHKA2 gene
(306000.0011-306000.0014). The mutations resulted in minor abnormalities
in the primary structure of the protein. These mutations are found in a
conserved RXX(X)T motif, resembling known phosphorylation sites that may
be involved in the regulation of PHK. Hendrickx et al. (1996) postulated
that PHK activity may be regulated by phosphorylation of these sites and
that type II GSD9A may be due to impaired activation of PHK activity.
The findings may explain why the in vitro PHK enzymatic activity is not
deficient in type II, whereas it is in type I.

Hendrickx et al. (1999) identified PHKA2 mutations in 10 patients with
GSD9A, types I and II. They proposed that mutations in GSD type I, in
which PHK activity is decreased in both liver and erythrocytes, results
from truncation or disruption of the PHKA2 protein. In contrast, all
type II mutations, which result in residual activity in erythrocytes,
were missense mutations or small in-frame deletions and insertions.
These results suggested that the biochemical differences between the 2
types of GSD IXa are due to the different nature of the disease-causing
mutations in PHKA2. Type I mutations may lead to absence of the alpha
subunit, which causes an unstable PHK holoenzyme and deficient enzyme
activity, whereas type II mutations may lead to in vivo deregulation of
PHK, which might be difficult to demonstrate in vitro.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE, TYPE IXa1
PHKA2, GLN1009TER

In a Belgian boy with glycogen storage disease IXa1 (306000), Hendrickx
et al. (1995) identified a C-to-T transition in exon 8, resulting in a
gln1009-to-ter (Q1009X) substitution. This led to a truncated protein
that lacked the C terminus, the phosphorylation site, and a putative
calmodulin-binding site. The patient had hepatomegaly, elevated liver
enzymes, and growth retardation that decreased with puberty. PHK
activity was completely absent from erythrocytes and liver.

.0002
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE, TYPE IXa1
PHKA2, GLN766TER

In a French boy with GSD type IXa1 (306000), Hendrickx et al. (1995)
found a C-to-T transition in exon 2 of the PHKA gene, resulting in a
gln766-to-ter (Q766X) substitution. This led to a truncated protein that
lacked the C terminus, the phosphorylation site, and both putative
calmodulin-binding sites. The patient had hepatomegaly, elevated liver
enzymes, and growth retardation. Erythrocyte PHK activity was 2% of
control values. His mildly affected sister had only hepatomegaly; her
erythrocyte PHK activity was 30% of control values.

.0003
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE, TYPE IXa1
PHKA2, IVS7DS, G-T, +1

In twin boys from the U.K. with GSD type IXa1 (306000), Hendrickx et al.
(1995) found a G-to-T transversion at position +1 of intron 7 of the
PHKA2 gene. This resulted in complete skipping of exon 7 and a PHKA2
protein lacking the 34 amino acids of this exon. Both patients had
hepatomegaly, growth retardation, and hypertriglyceridemia, but not
hypercholesterolemia. Only 1 had increased liver enzymes. Hepatomegaly
disappeared in both boys between ages 8 and 10 years. Erythrocyte
activity was 8 and 4% of control values, respectively.

.0004
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE, TYPE IXa1
PHKA2, SER1049TER

In 2 brothers from the U.K. with GSD type IXa1 (306000), Hendrickx et
al. (1995) found a C-to-A transversion in exon 11 of the PHKA2 gene,
resulting in a ser1049-to-ter (S1049X) substitution and protein lacking
more than 180 amino acids of the C terminus, including the 3-prime
putative calmodulin binding site. Both patients had growth retardation,
hepatomegaly, and elevated liver enzymes. Erythrocyte PHK activity was
5.7 and 16.9% of control values, respectively.

.0005
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE, TYPE IXa1
PHKA2, PRO1205LEU

In affected members of a large Dutch family with GSD type IXa1 (306000)
previously described by Huijing and Fernandez (1969) and Willems et al.
(1990), van den Berg et al. (1995) found a 3614C-T transition in the
PHKA2 gene, resulting in a pro1205-to-leu (P1205L) substitution in a
highly conserved region of the protein.

.0006
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE, TYPE IXa1
PHKA2, 3-BP DEL, 419TCT

In a Dutch boy with GSD type IXa1 (306000), van den Berg et al. (1995)
found a 3-bp deletion (419_421), resulting in deletion of
phenylalanine-141 from the gene product. The same deletion was found in
the PHKA2 coding sequence from lymphocytes of the patient's mother in
heterozygous state. This phenylalanine is a highly conserved amino acid
between species.

.0007
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE, TYPE IXa1
PHKA2, ASP299GLY

Burwinkel et al. (1996) identified an A-to-G transition in the PHKA2
gene, resulting in an asp299-to-gly (D299G) substitution, in a patient
they classified as having X-linked GSD IXa2 (see 306000). However,
Beauchamp et al. (2007) identified the D299G mutation in a patient with
reduced PHK activity in erythrocytes and leukocytes, consistent with GSD
IXa1 (306000). They suggested that D299G should be reclassified as a GSD
IXa1 mutation.

.0008
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE, TYPE IXa2
PHKA2, ARG186HIS

In a patient with X-linked GSD IXa2 (see 306000), Burwinkel et al.
(1996) identified a G-to-A transition in the PHKA2 gene, resulting in an
arg186-to-his (R186H) substitution.

Hendrickx et al. (1998) presented clinical, biochemical, and molecular
findings in a patient with type II X-linked liver glycogenosis and the
R186H mutation in the PHKA2 gene. The patient had been followed for 40
years. Although growth was retarded early in life, he achieved a height
of 182 cm at the age of 33 years. Thyroid therapy appeared to be helpful
in this patient. Five male relatives also had liver glycogenosis.

.0009

PHKA2, HIS132PRO

In a patient with GSD IXa2 (see 306000), Burwinkel et al. (1996)
identified an A-to-C transversion in the PHKA2 gene, resulting in a
his132-to-pro (H132P) substitution.

arg556-to-cys (R556C) substitution.

.0013
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE, TYPE IXa2
PHKA2, 3-BP DEL, NT750

In a patient with X-linked GSD IXa2 (see 306000), Hendrickx et al.
(1996) identified an in-frame 3-bp deletion (750_752) in the PHKA2 gene,
resulting in the deletion of thr251.

.0014
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE, TYPE IXa2
PHKA2, 6-BP INS, NT3331

In a patient with X-linked GSD type IXa2 (see 306000), Hendrickx et al.
(1996) identified an in-frame 6-bp insertion between nucleotides 3331
and 3332 of the PHKA2 gene, resulting in the insertion of a threonine
and an arginine residue between arg1111 and glu1112 (R1111insTR).

.0015
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE, TYPE IXa2
PHKA2, LYS189GLU

In a patient with X-linked GSD IXa2 (see 306000), Burwinkel et al.
(1998) described an A-to-G transition in the PHKA2 coding sequence,
resulting in a lys189-to-glu (K189E) substitution. The phenotype in the
patient was that of low PHK activity in liver tissue, but activity in
erythrocytes was 4-fold higher than normal.

608712	TITLE *608712 PROTEIN-TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE, RECEPTOR-TYPE, T; PTPRT
;;RPTP-RHO;;
KIAA0283
DESCRIPTION For general information about receptor-type protein-tyrosine
phosphatases, see PTPRA (176884).

CLONING

By RT-PCR using primers for dystroglycan (128239), followed by screening
cerebellar and frontal cortex cDNA libraries and RACE-PCR, McAndrew et
al. (1998) isolated a full-length cDNA encoding PTPRT, which they called
RPTP-rho. The deduced 1,461-amino acid PTPRT protein contains a meprin
(see 600388)-A5-PTP-mu (176888) (MAM) domain, an immunoglobulin-like
domain, 4 fibronectin (135600) type III repeats, a single transmembrane
(TM) domain, a potential proteolytic cleavage site, and 2 highly
conserved phosphatase domains, 1 of which contains an 11-amino acid
hallmark catalytic sequence. McAndrew et al. (1998) also identified a
splice variant lacking a 57-bp exon (19 amino acids) in cerebellar and
frontal cortex. Northern blot analysis detected a 12-kb PTPRT transcript
solely in brain. In situ hybridization showed expression of mouse Ptprt
throughout the adult brain, with highest expression in the hippocampus
and dentate gyrus, olfactory bulb, subiculum, cerebral cortex, pyriform
cortex, medullary motor nuclei, and anterior cerebellum. During
development, Ptprt expression was mainly restricted to postmigratory
cells in the olfactory bulbs and the frontal cortex. Expression of Ptprt
was then downregulated in these cells and appeared in the cerebellum at
postnatal days 8 to 10.

Besco et al. (2001) reported that PTPRT encodes a predicted 1,463-amino
acid protein. They cloned murine Ptprt, which encodes a 1,451-amino acid
protein that shares 96% identity with human PTPRT. Using RT-PCR, Besco
et al. (2001) identified 3 alternatively spliced exons in human and
mouse PTPRT, including the variant exon reported by McAndrew et al.
(1998). These variant exons encode a 19-amino acid region before the TM
domain, a 10-amino acid region between the TM domain and the first
phosphatase domain, and a 20-amino acid region within the first
phosphatase domain.

GENE FUNCTION

McAndrew et al. (1998) performed in situ hybridization analysis of Ptprt
expression in normal and 'meander tail' mutant mouse cerebellum. Ptprt
expression was restricted to the granular cell layer within lobules 1 to
6 in a manner similar to FGF1 (131220), thus defining a boundary between
anterior and posterior cerebellar compartments. This boundary was close
to the boundary of the disorganized anterior cerebellum in meander tail
and to the anterior boundary of Otx2 (600037) expression.

GENE STRUCTURE

Besco et al. (2001) determined that the PTPRT gene contains at least 33
coding exons and spans 1 Mb.

MAPPING

McAndrew et al. (1998) used somatic cell hybrid analysis to map the
PTPRT gene to chromosome 20. They mapped the mouse Ptprt gene to
chromosome 2 in a region that shows homology of synteny to human
chromosome 20q12-q13.1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Wang et al. (2004) performed a mutational analysis of the tyrosine
phosphatase gene superfamily in human cancers and identified 83 somatic
mutations in 6 protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPRF, 179590; PTPRG,
176886; PTPRT; PTPN3, 176877; PTPN13, 600267; and PTPN14, 603155),
affecting 26% of colorectal cancers and a smaller fraction of lung,
breast, and gastric cancers. Fifteen mutations were nonsense,
frameshift, or splice site alterations predicted to result in truncated
proteins lacking phosphatase activity. Wang et al. (2004) biochemically
examined 5 missense mutations in PTPRT, the most commonly altered
protein-tyrosine phosphatase, and found that they reduced phosphatase
activity. Expression of wildtype but not a mutant PTPRT in human cancer
cells inhibited cell growth. Wang et al. (2004) concluded that their
observations suggested that the mutated tyrosine phosphatases are tumor
suppressor genes, regulating cellular pathways that may be amenable to
therapeutic intervention.

;;MITOFILIN;;
HEART MUSCLE PROTEIN; HMP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The heart muscle protein gene is expressed predominantly in the heart
and is proposed to be an ATP-driven motor protein that interacts with
cytoskeletal components. Icho et al. (1994) cloned a full-length 2.7-kb
cDNA coding for a 758-amino acid protein. The protein has a possible
ATP-binding domain at the N terminus and a long alpha-helical domain
that could form a coiled-coil structure. Proteins with similar
structures include myosin II (see 160730), an actin-based motor protein,
and kinesin (see 602809), a microtubule-based motor protein.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the IMMT
gene to chromosome 2p11.2 (TMAP G62066).

120328	TITLE *120328 COLLAGEN, TYPE XVIII, ALPHA-1; COL18A1
ENDOSTATIN, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Oh et al. (1994) isolated overlapping mouse cDNAs encoding a novel
collagenous polypeptide, alpha-1(XVIII) collagen. Nucleotide sequence
analysis showed that the COL18A1 gene contains 10 triple-helical domains
separated and flanked by nontriple-helical regions. Within the
nontriple-helical regions, there are several ser-gly-containing
sequences that conform to the consensus sequences for glycosaminoglycan
attachment sites in proteoglycan core proteins. Northern blot analysis
detected COL18A1 transcripts in multiple organs, with the highest levels
in liver, lung, and kidney.

Oh et al. (1994) reported the isolation of human cDNAs and genomic DNAs
representing the COL18A1 gene.

Several lines of direct evidence show that angiogenesis is essential for
the growth and persistence of solid tumors and metastases. To stimulate
angiogenesis, tumors upregulate a variety of angiogenic factors. Many
malignant tumors, however, also generate inhibitors of angiogenesis,
including angiostatin. O'Reilly et al. (1994) discovered an angiogenesis
inhibitor, designated angiostatin, that specifically inhibits
endothelial cell proliferation. They showed that angiostatin is an
internal fragment of plasminogen, containing at least 3 of the kringles
of plasminogen. Using a rationale similar to that for the isolation of
angiostatin, O'Reilly et al. (1997) isolated a 20-kD angiogenesis
inhibitor, which they called endostatin, from a murine
hemangioendothelioma. They found that endostatin is a C-terminal
fragment of collagen XVIII. Systemic therapy with endostatin caused the
nearly complete suppression of tumor-induced angiogenesis and strong
antitumor activity.

Saarela et al. (1998) reported full-length human type XVIII collagen
cDNAs that encode 2 variant chains of 1,516 and 1,336 residues. They
found that the 2 chains have different signal peptides and N-terminal
NC1 domains. The amino acid sequences of the human and previously
characterized mouse alpha-1(XVIII) chains exhibited an overall identity
of 79%. The highest homology between these chains was observed in their
last 184 residues, corresponding to the proteolytic fragment endostatin.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rehn et al. (1996) showed that the mouse Col18a1 gene contains 43 exons
spanning over 100 kb and that 2 alternative promoters are used. Promoter
1, which is about 50 kb upstream and adjacent to exons 1 and 2, produces
a transcript that skips exon 3. Promoter 2, adjacent to exon 3, produces
2 types of transcripts depending on alternative splicing of that exon.
All 3 predicted proteins differ in their amino-terminal noncollagenous
domains.

MAPPING

Using a genomic clone as a probe for fluorescence in situ hybridization,
Oh et al. (1994) mapped the COL18A1 gene to 21q22.3. In addition, using
an interspecific backcross panel, they showed that the murine Col18a1 is
on chromosome 10, close to the Col6a1 and Col6a2 genes.

GENE FUNCTION

Upon comparison of COL18A1 sequences with those of COL15A1 (120325), Oh
et al. (1994) observed a striking similarity in the lengths of the 6
most carboxyl-terminal triple-helical domains. In addition, within the
carboxyl nontriple-helical domain NC1 of the 2 chains, a region of 177
amino acid residues showed about 60% identity. The similarities in
structure suggested that the collagens are functionally related, and
their distinct structure pointed to differences from other known
collagen types. Oh et al. (1994) concluded that they belonged to a novel
subfamily of extracellular matrix proteins with multiple triple-helical
domains, and proposed to designate these as multiplexins, for 'protein
with multiple triple-helix domains and interruptions.'

Based on mouse cDNA clones, Rehn and Pihlajaniemi (1994) likewise
pointed out the homology between type XVIII and type XV collagens.
Northern blot analysis demonstrated a striking tissue distribution for
type XVIII collagen mRNAs, as the clones hybridized strongly with mRNAs
of 4.3 and 5.3 kilobases that were present only in lung and liver of the
8 mouse tissues studied.

Endostatin is a potent antiangiogenic protein. Karumanchi et al. (2001)
showed that alkaline phosphatase-tagged endostatin bound endothelial
cells, revealing 2 binding affinities. Expression cloning identified the
cell surface proteoglycan glypican, specifically glypican-1 (600395) or
glypican-4 (300168), as the lower-affinity receptor. Biochemical and
genetic studies indicated that the heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans of
glypican were critical for endostatin binding. Furthermore, endostatin
selected a specific octasulfated hexasaccharide from a sequence in
heparin. Karumanchi et al. (2001) also demonstrated a role for
endostatin in renal tubular cell branching morphogenesis and showed that
glypicans serve as low-affinity receptors for endostatin in these cells,
as in endothelial cells. Antisense experiments suggested the critical
importance of glypicans in mediating endostatin activities.

In humans, the COL18A1 gene encodes 2 distinct isoforms by use of 2
promoters, 1 of which is located upstream from exon 1 and the other of
which is located upstream from exon 3 (Saarela et al., 1998). The 2
isoforms differ only at their signal peptides, with different N-terminal
noncollagenous domains that are 303 or 493 residues in length.

Suzuki et al. (2002) showed that the longer human COL18A1 isoform, with
728 residues, is expressed in several tissues including the human eye.
Lack of either the short variant or all of the collagen XVIII isoforms
causes similar phenotypes but those patients who lack all forms present
more severe ocular alterations.

Tumstatin and endostatin, 2 inhibitors of angiogenesis, derive from the
precursor human collagen molecules COL4A3 (120070) and COL18A1,
respectively. Although both of these inhibitors are NC1 domain fragments
of collagens, they share only 14% amino acid homology. Sudhakar et al.
(2003) evaluated the functional receptors, mechanism of action, and
intracellular signaling induced by these 2 collagen-derived inhibitors.
Tumstatin prevents angiogenesis through inhibition of endothelial cell
proliferation and promotion of apoptosis with no effect on migration,
whereas endostatin prevents endothelial cell migration with no effect on
proliferation. Sudhakar et al. (2003) demonstrated that tumstatin binds
to alpha-V-beta-3 integrin (193210, 173470) in a
vitronectin/fibronectin/RGD cyclic peptide-independent manner, whereas
endostatin competes with fibronectin/RGD cyclic peptide to bind
alpha-5-beta-1 integrin (135620, 135630). The activity of tumstatin is
mediated by alpha-V-beta-3 integrin, whereas the activity of endostatin
is mediated by alpha-5-beta-1 integrin. Because of the distinct
properties of tumstatin and endostatin, indicating their diverse
antiangiogenic actions, the authors suggested the 2 be combined for
targeting tumor angiogenesis.

By immunoprecipitation analysis using membrane fractions of human
mammary epithelial cells, Shi et al. (2007) showed that endostatin
specifically bound to cell surface nucleolin (NCL; 164035) with high
affinity. Blockage of nucleolin with neutralizing antibody or knockdown
of nucleolin by RNA interference countered the antiendothelial activity
of endostatin and abrogated its antiangiogenic and antitumor activity in
vivo. Nucleolin and endostatin colocalized on the cell surface of
endothelial cells in tumors, and endostatin was internalized and
transported into cell nuclei of endothelial cells via nucleolin. In the
nucleus, phosphorylation of nucleolin, which is critical for cell
proliferation, was inhibited by endostatin. Shi et al. (2007) concluded
that nucleolin is an endostatin receptor that mediates the
antiangiogenic and antitumor activities of endostatin.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Knobloch syndrome-1 (KNO1; 267750) is an autosomal recessive disorder
defined by the occurrence of high myopia, vitreoretinal degeneration
with retinal detachment, macular abnormalities, and occipital
encephalocele. The KNO1 causative gene had been assigned to a 4.3-cM
interval at 21q22.3 by linkage analysis in a large consanguineous
Brazilian family. Sertie et al. (2000) narrowed the candidate interval
to a region of less than 245 kb, which contained 24 expressed sequence
tags, including the 5-prime end of the COL18A1 gene. They identified a
homozygous mutation at the AG consensus acceptor splice site of COL18A1
intron 1 (120328.0001) in 12 patients with Knobloch syndrome. Due to
alternative splicing, the mutation creates a stop codon in exon 4, thus
truncating the alpha-1(XVIII) collagen short form, which was otherwise
expressed in human adult retina. The authors concluded that Knobloch
syndrome-1 is caused by mutations in the COL18A1 gene, which may play a
major role in retinal structure as well as in the closure of the neural
tube.

Suzuki et al. (2002) screened the entire coding region and the
exon-intron boundaries of the COL18A1 gene in 8 unrelated patients with
Knobloch syndrome. Sixty different pathogenic changes were identified in
alleles of 5 unrelated patients with KNO1 (3 compound heterozygotes and
2 homozygotes). All were truncating mutations leading to deficiency of 1
or all collagen XVIII isoforms and endostatin. A 2-bp mutation in exon
41 (120328.0002) was found in 3 unrelated individuals, each on a
different haplotype, suggesting that this mutation had occurred more
than once. Suzuki et al. (2002) found low endostatin plasma levels in
those patients with mutations leading to deficiency of all isoforms.
None of the patients with mutations in the COL18A1 gene had any major
kidney or liver defects, which was surprising because the 3 isoforms are
highly expressed in these organs. The lack of collagen XVIII may be
compensated by collagen XV (120325). Suzuki et al. (2002) suggested that
predisposition to epilepsy might be due to abnormal neuronal migration.
In 2 patients with Knobloch syndrome, one an isolated case and the other
familial, Suzuki et al. (2002) could not detect any mutation in the
COL18A1 gene, indicating nonallelic genetic heterogeneity of the
disorder.

Analysis of 2 unrelated families with Knobloch syndrome from Hungary and
New Zealand allowed Menzel et al. (2004) to confirm the involvement of
COL18A1 in the pathogenesis of the disorder and to demonstrate the
existence of genetic heterogeneity. Affected members of the Hungarian
family were compound heterozygous for 2 mutations of the COL18A1 gene: a
1-bp insertion causing a frameshift and a premature in-frame stop codon
(120328.0003) and an amino acid substitution (D104N endostatin/D1437N
COL18A1; 120328.0004). The missense variant was located in a conserved
amino acid of endostatin and was presumed to be pathogenic because
Menzel et al. (2004) showed that the endostatin mutant was impaired in
its affinity towards laminin; however, the authors considered that the
D104N variant may also be in cis with an unidentified mutation. Iughetti
et al. (2001) described this polymorphic change at residue 104 of
endostatin. Suzuki et. al (2005) and Antonarakis et al. (2005) discussed
the pathogenic role of this mutation in KNO1.

Najmabadi et al. (2011) performed homozygosity mapping followed by exon
enrichment and next-generation sequencing in 136 consanguineous families
(over 90% Iranian and less than 10% Turkish or Arabic) segregating
syndromic or nonsyndromic forms of autosomal recessive intellectual
disability. In a family (M175) that was the product of a first-cousin
union with 5 healthy children and 2 affected with Knobloch syndrome,
they identified a causative homozygous frameshift mutation in the
COL18A1 gene (120328.0007).

ANIMAL MODEL

Marneros and Olsen (2003) found that abnormalities in the iris and
ciliary body of Col18a1 -/- mice demonstrated the important role of
collagen XVIII in the function of ocular basement membranes. The absence
of collagen XVIII altered the properties of basement membranes and led
to severe defects in the iris, showing striking similarities to human
pigment dispersion syndrome (600510). In addition, loss of collagen
XVIII created changes that allowed clump cells to migrate out of the
iris. Marneros and Olsen (2003) showed that clump cells are
macrophage-like cells which were able to penetrate the inner limiting
membrane in mutant mice. They concluded that Col18a1 deficient mice
might serve as a model of, and had demonstrated the potential importance
of alterations in extracellular matrix components in, human pigment
dispersion syndrome.

Utriainen et al. (2004) showed that Col18a1-null C57BL mice exhibited
dilation of the brain ventricles with 20% of mice developing
hydrocephalus. There was significant broadening of the epithelial
basement membrane of the choroid plexuses (CP). The CP epithelial cell
morphology was altered, and cells from Col18a1-null mice contained more
vacuoles compared to cells from wildtype mice, suggestive of alterations
in CSF production. Markedly broadened basement membranes were found in
the atrioventricular valves of the heart and in the kidney tubules,
whereas the glomerular mesangial matrix of kidneys was expanded in
Col18a1-null mice and serum creatinine levels were elevated, indicating
alterations in kidney filtration capacity. Utriainen et al. (2004)
concluded that type XVIII collagen is a structurally important
constituent of basement membranes and that its absence can result in a
variety of phenotypic alterations.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
KNOBLOCH SYNDROME 1
COL18A1, IVS1, A-T, -2

Sertie et al. (2000) identified a homozygous mutation at the AG
consensus acceptor splice site of COL18A1 intron 1 exclusively in 12
Knobloch syndrome (KNO1; 267750) patients; the mutation was not found
among 140 control chromosomes. Due to alternative splicing, the mutation
creates a stop codon in exon 4, thus truncating the COL18A1 short form,
which was otherwise expressed in human adult retina.

.0002
KNOBLOCH SYNDROME 1
COL18A1, 2-BP DEL, 3514CT

Suzuki et al. (2002) reported genotyping studies of 3 unrelated patients
with Knobloch syndrome (KNO1; 267750) who were compound heterozygotes
for a 2-bp deletion (3514-3515delCT) in exon 41 of the COL18A1 gene,
each in combination with a different mutant companion allele. The 2-bp
deletion was on the paternal allele in 2 cases and on the maternal
allele in the third. A different haplotype was associated with this
common pathogenic allele, suggesting that the mutation had originated
more than once. Two of these patients had an encephalocele that had been
resected; the third had a bone defect visualized by CT scan. All 3 had
myopia and vitreoretinal degeneration and 2 had had retinal detachment.
One of the patients, aged 21 years, had been blind from the age of 5.

Paisan-Ruiz et al. (2009) reported 2 sisters from a small village in
northern India who were homozygous for the 3514delCT mutation. They had
a complex neurologic disorder, including cognitive decline beginning
around age 3 years, seizures, and adult-onset of progressive visual
problems and cerebellar ataxia. The 48-year-old proband had glaucoma,
lens dislocation, and retinal and corneal dystrophy. Cerebellar ataxia
affected both upper and lower limbs, and she had nystagmus. She was
independent for toileting and dressing. Brain MRI showed frontal
polymicrogyria with severe cerebral and cerebellar atrophy. Her sister
had a similar disease course. The 2-bp deletion occurred at nucleotide
3514 in isoform 2 and at nucleotide 4054 in isoform 1, resulting in
frameshifts of both isoforms. Paisan-Ruiz et al. (2009) noted the
expanding phenotypic variability associated with this mutation and with
Knobloch syndrome.

Mahajan et al. (2010) reported 2 sisters, born of unrelated El
Salvadorian parents, with Knobloch syndrome who were homozygous for the
3514delCT deletion. In addition to the occipital defect and classic
ophthalmologic findings in both girls, 1 developed acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL), pre-B type, at age 4 years. Mahajan et al. (2010)
speculated that lack of endostatin in these patients, resulting from the
deletion, may have contributed to the development of ALL in 1 of the
girls.

KNOBLOCH SYNDROME 1
COL18A1, 1-BP INS

In a Hungarian family with KNO1 (267750) described by Czeizel et al.
(1992), Menzel et al. (2004) found that affected members had compound
heterozygosity for a nonsense mutation and a missense mutation. The
nonsense mutation was a 1-bp insertion of a C in exon 35
(c.3363_3364insC) that created a frameshift and a premature stop codon
in exon 40. A brother and sister had severe myopia, lens abnormalities,
vitreal opacities, pigmented macular abnormalities, and retinal
detachment. They each had an occipital meningocele at birth that was
surgically removed and did not cause any subsequent problems. There was
no cognitive impairment and a CT scan did not show any alterations in
the cerebral ventricles and brain structure. The missense mutation was
asp1437-to-asn in the COL18A1 gene (D104N endostatin/D1437N COL18A1;
120328.0004). The variant was located at residue 104 in endostatin.
Menzel et al. (2004) showed that endostatin N104 was impaired in its
affinity towards laminin.

KNOBLOCH SYNDROME 1
COL18A1, IVS36DS, A-C, +3

In 2 sibs with Knobloch syndrome (267750), born of consanguineous
Algerian parents, Keren et al. (2007) identified a homozygous A-to-C
transversion in intron 36 of the COL18A1 gene. The older sib had
occipital meningocele, rapidly progressive myopia with subsequent
retinal detachment at age 5 years, and evidence of a neuronal migration
disorder with pachygyria and polymicrogyria. She showed mildly delayed
development and learning disability.

.0006
KNOBLOCH SYNDROME 1
COL18A1, 2-BP DEL, 3617CT

In affected members of a consanguineous Pakistani family with Knobloch
syndrome (267750) originally reported by Khaliq et al. (2007), Joyce et
al. (2010) identified a homozygous 2-bp deletion (3617delCT) in exon 40
of the COL18A1 gene, predicted to result in premature termination. The
mutation was not found in 426 controls. The patients had myopia,
vitreoretinal degeneration, and occipital scalp defect, but did not have
encephalocele, retinal detachment, or cardiovascular abnormalities. This
family had previously been reported to define a novel locus on
chromosome 17q11.2 (KNO3), but the molecular results of Joyce et al.
(2010) indicated that there is no evidence to support the KNO3 locus.
The original mapping by Khaliq et al. (2007) used microsatellite
markers, whereas the mapping by Joyce et al. (2010) used high-density
SNP arrays.

KNOBLOCH SYNDROME 1
COL18A1, 2-BP DEL

In a family (M175) in which first-cousin parents had 5 healthy children
and 2 children with Knobloch syndrome (267750), characterized by
intellectual disability and retinopathy, Najmabadi et al. (2011)
identified a 2-bp deletion at genomic coordinate
Chr21:45,754,433-45,754,434 (NCBI36) in the COL18A1 gene, resulting in a
frameshift at codon 1587 (Leu1587fs). The mutation was found in
homozygosity in affected individuals of the family.

.0008
KNOBLOCH SYNDROME 1
COL18A1, 1-BP DEL, NT3514

In the probands of 2 Saudi families with Knobloch syndrome (267750),
Aldahmesh et al. (2013) identified a homozygous 1-bp deletion
(c.3514_3515del) in the COL18A1 gene, resulting in a frameshift and
premature termination (Leu1172ValfsTer72). One proband was 6 months old
and had retinal detachment, high myopia, and occipital cutis aplasia.
The other proband was an 11-year-old boy with various ocular anomalies,
high myopia, and epilepsy. An Irish girl with the disorder was compound
heterozygous for c.3514_3515del and a 1-bp duplication in the COL18A1
gene (c.2118dup), resulting in a frameshift and premature termination
(Gly707ArgfsTer23; 120328.0009). She had high myopia, vitreous
abnormalities, and a bald patch over the vertex of her head.

614060	TITLE *614060 HOXA DISTAL TRANSCRIPT ANTISENSE RNA; HOTTIP
;;HOXA TRANSCRIPT AT THE DISTAL TIP;;
NONCODING RNA 213; NCRNA00213
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

HOTTIP is a long intergenic noncoding RNA transcribed from the antisense
strand at the 5-prime end of the HOXA gene cluster (see HOXA13; 142959).
HOTTIP coordinates activation of several 5-prime HOXA genes (Wang et
al., 2011).

CLONING

By examining chromatin conformation near the 5-prime end of the HOXA
gene cluster in anatomically distal cells, such as foreskin and foot
fibroblasts, Wang et al. (2011) identified a transcript, HOTTIP, that
was associated with abundant chromatin interactions. By 5-prime and
3-prime RACE, they obtained full-length HOTTIP. HOTTIP is a
3,764-nucleotide RNA that is spliced and polyadenylated. It is
transcribed from the strand antisense to the HOXA genes. Examination of
HOTTIP expression in primary human fibroblasts from 11 anatomic sites
showed that HOTTIP was expressed in posterior and distal sites,
consistent with its location at the 5-prime end of the HOXA gene locus.
In situ hybridization of developing mouse and chick embryos also showed
Hottip expression in posterior and distal sites, indicating a conserved
expression pattern from development to adulthood.

GENE FUNCTION

Wang et al. (2011) found that knockdown of HOTTIP via small interfering
RNA in human foreskin fibroblasts abrogated the expression of distally
expressed HOXA genes, with inhibition of expression dependent upon the
distance to HOTTIP. The strongest blockade was observed for HOXA13 and
HOXA11 (142958), with progressively less severe effects on HOXA10
(142957), HOXA9 (142956), and HOXA7 (142950). Knockdown of Hottip
expression in embryonic chicken limb bud decreased expression of Hoxa13,
Hoxa11, and Hoxa10, with graded impact dependent on genomic proximity to
the Hottip gene, resulting in shortened and bent distal bony elements.
HOTTIP knockdown led to broad loss of histone-3 (H3; see 602810) lys4
trimethylation (H3K4me3) and H3K4me2 across the HOXA locus, most
prominently over the 5-prime HOXA genes and the HOTTIP gene itself.
HOTTIP knockdown also reduced the occupancy of HOXA transcriptional
start sites by the histone methyltransferase components MLL1 (159555)
and WDR5 (609012). Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that HOTTIP
interacted directly with WDR5. Ectopic overexpression of HOTTIP did not
alter HOXA gene expression unless the construct was targeted to the HOXA
locus. Wang et al. (2011) concluded that chromatin looping positions
HOTTIP RNA in close proximity to 5-prime HOXA genes, permitting
recruitment of WDR5-MLL complexes to the 5-prime HOXA genes, and
resulting in a gradient of HOXA gene activation.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Wang et al. (2011) determined that the
HOTTIP gene is located approximately 330 bases upstream of the HOXA13
gene on chromosome 7p15.2. HOTTIP is transcribed from the opposite
strand relative to the HOXA genes.

;;TRXR2;;
THIOREDOXIN REDUCTASE, MITOCHONDRIAL;;
TR-BETA;;
TR3;;
SELENOPROTEIN Z; SELZ
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Thioredoxin reductases (EC 1.6.4.5), such as TXNRD2, are selenocysteine
(sec)-containing flavoenzymes that maintain thioredoxins, small proteins
that catalyze redox reactions, in the reduced state using the reducing
power of NADPH. The sec residue, which is essential for enzyme activity,
is located in the penultimate C-terminal position and is encoded by a
UGA codon. Sec differs from cys in that it substitutes selenium, a
better nucleophile, for sulfur. Termination of polypeptide synthesis is
prevented by a stem-loop structure called the selenocysteine insertion
sequence, or SECIS, which is located in the 3-prime UTR (Gasdaska et
al., 1999; Sun et al., 1999).

CLONING

By screening placenta, heart, and fetal heart cDNA libraries with a
fragment of TR-alpha (TXNRD1; 601112) as probe, Gasdaska et al. (1999)
isolated a cDNA encoding TXNRD2, which they called TR-beta. The deduced
524-amino acid protein, which is 54% identical to TXNRD1, has a high
content of positively charged residues in the N terminus and a conserved
penultimate sec residue. Analysis of the 3-prime UTR revealed the
presence of a region with the sequence and structure of a SECIS,
although it is distinct from that of TXNRD1. Northern blot analysis
detected ubiquitous expression of a 2.4-kb TXNRD2 transcript, with
highest levels in prostate, testis, liver, uterus, and small intestine;
this expression pattern is distinct from that of TXNRD1. Western blot
analysis showed expression of a 54-kD cytosolic protein.

By searching an EST database for sequences homologous to TXNRD1,
Miranda-Vizuete et al. (1999) obtained a nearly complete cDNA encoding
TXNRD2, which they called TRXR2. The predicted protein contains an
N-terminal mitochondrial localization sequence (MLS), conserved FAD- and
NADPH-binding domains, and a conserved active site. Fluorescence
microscopy and mutation analysis demonstrated a mitochondrial
localization that requires the presence of the N-terminal MLS.

By EST database searching, Sun et al. (1999) identified TXNRD2, which
they called TR3, as well as TXNRD3 (606235), which they called TR2.

By EST database searching for sequences that could adopt a SECIS-like
secondary structure, glutathione peroxidase functional analysis, and
5-prime RACE, Lescure et al. (1999) identified 2 cDNAs encoding isoforms
of TXNRD2, which they termed SELZ.

GENE FUNCTION

Gasdaska et al. (1999) showed that TXNRD2 was a thioredoxin reductase
that could directly reduce proteins such as insulin.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Miranda-Vizuete et al. (1999) determined
that the TXNRD2 gene contains 18 exons and spans 67 kb.

MAPPING

By STS analysis and genomic sequence analysis, respectively,
Miranda-Vizuete et al. (1999) and Sun et al. (1999) mapped the TXNRD2
gene to chromosome 22q11.2. Miranda-Vizuete et al. (1999) and Kawai et
al. (2000) mapped the mouse gene to chromosome 16.

ANIMAL MODEL

Duplications of human chromosome 22q11.2 (608363) are associated with
elevated rates of mental retardation, autism, and many other behavioral
phenotypes. Suzuki et al. (2009) determined the developmental impact of
overexpression of an approximately 190-kb segment of human 22q11.2,
which includes the genes TXNRD2, COMT (116790), and ARVCF (602269), on
behaviors in bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mice. BAC
transgenic mice and wildtype mice were tested for their cognitive
capacities, affect- and stress-related behaviors, and motor activity at
1 and 2 months of age. BAC transgenic mice approached a rewarded goal
faster (i.e., incentive learning), but were impaired in delayed rewarded
alternation during development. In contrast, BAC transgenic and wildtype
mice were indistinguishable in rewarded alternation without delays,
spontaneous alternation, prepulse inhibition, social interaction,
anxiety-, stress-, and fear-related behaviors, and motor activity.
Compared with wildtype mice, BAC transgenic mice had a 2-fold higher
level of COMT activity in the prefrontal cortex, striatum, and
hippocampus. Suzuki et al. (2009) suggested that overexpression of this
22q11.2 segment may enhance incentive learning and impair the prolonged
maintenance of working memory, but has no apparent affect on working
memory per se, affect- and stress-related behaviors, or motor capacity.
High copy numbers of this 22q11.2 segment may contribute to a highly
selective set of phenotypes in learning and cognition during
development.

300899	TITLE *300899 RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN L39; RPL39
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Ribosomes, the site of protein synthesis in the cell, are composed of 4
ribosomal RNA species (see 180450) and approximately 80 ribosomal
proteins. Otsuka et al. (1996) cloned the RPL39 gene, the human gene
encoding the L39 ribosomal protein, by random cDNA sequencing of a colon
carcinoma cDNA library. The gene encodes a 51-amino acid polypeptide.
Northern blot analysis revealed ubiquitous expression of the RPL39
transcript. Although the level of RPL39 mRNA varied in several cell
lines, including carcinoma cell lines, its level was not cell cycle
dependent in fibroblasts.

Tsui et al. (1996) isolated a human heart cDNA encoding RPL39. The
deduced RPL39 protein has 20 basic residues but no acidic ones; its
calculated isoelectric point is 13.05. The predicted human and rat RPL39
proteins are identical.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid analyses, Uechi et al.
(2001) mapped the RPL39 gene to chromosome Xq22. Gross (2013) mapped the
RPL39 gene to chromosome Xq24 based on an alignment of the RPL39
sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB061835) with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

142959	TITLE *142959 HOMEOBOX A13; HOXA13
;;HOMEOBOX 1J; HOX1J
DESCRIPTION For background information on homeobox genes, see HOXA7 (142950).

CLONING

Mortlock and Innis (1997) determined the complete coding sequence for
HOXA13.

GENE FUNCTION

Rinn et al. (2008) stated that fibroblasts obtained from anatomically
distinct sites of human skin express genes in a site-specific manner. By
microarray analysis of cultured fibroblasts derived from foot or thigh,
followed by comparing gene expression profiles of primary fibroblasts
from 43 anatomic sites, Rinn et al. (2008) found that HOXA13 expression
was associated with distal sites and was required for activation of
distal-specific gene expression, including expression of WNT5A (164975).
Depletion of HOXA13 in human plantar fibroblasts reduced expression of
distal-specific keratin-9 (KRT9; 607606), and KRT9 expression was
rescued by addition of recombinant purified WNT5A. In situ hybridization
showed that Hoxa13 and Wnt5a were spatially and temporally coexpressed
in distal limb bud during mouse development. Rinn et al. (2008)
concluded that HOXA13 control of WNT5A expression in distal fibroblasts
can regulate site-specific epidermal differentiation.

Sheth et al. (2012) used mouse genetics to analyze how digit patterning
(an iterative digit/nondigit pattern) is generated and showed that the
progressive reduction in Hoxa13 and Hoxd11 (142986)-Hoxd13 (142989)
genes (hereafter referred to as distal Hox genes) from the Gli3
(165240)-null background results in progressively more severe
polydactyly, displaying thinner and densely packed digits. Combined with
computer modeling, their results argued for a Turing-type mechanism
underlying digit patterning, in which the dose of distal Hox genes
modulates the digit period or wavelength. The phenotypic similarity of
fish-fin endoskeleton patterns suggested that the pentadactyl state has
been achieved through modification of an ancestral Turing-type
mechanism.

MAPPING

HOXA13 belongs to the cluster of homeobox genes on chromosome 7. As
reviewed by Acampora et al. (1989), the homeobox region 1 includes at
least 8 homeobox genes in 90 kb of DNA located on chromosome 7.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Mortlock (1996) found a mutation in the HOXA13 gene resulting in
hand-foot-uterus (HFU) syndrome, also known as hand-foot-genital (HFG)
syndrome (140000). Their observations were made in the family reported
by Stern et al. (1970). This was the second mutation discovered in a HOX
gene as the cause of a malformation; the first to be discovered was the
mutation in HOXD13 (142989) as the cause of synpolydactyly (186000).

Mortlock and Innis (1997) found that affected members of an HFG syndrome
family reported by Stern et al. (1970) had a mutation in the HOXA13 gene
that converted a highly conserved tryptophan residue in the homeodomain
to a stop codon with resulting truncation of 20 amino acids from the
protein (142959.0001). It was thought that the mutation probably
eliminated or greatly reduced the ability of the protein to bind to DNA.

Goodman et al. (2000) examined the HOXA13 gene in 2 new and 4 previously
reported families with features of HFG syndrome. In 3 families, nonsense
mutations truncating the encoded protein N-terminal to or within the
homeodomain produced typical limb and genitourinary abnormalities; in
the fourth family, an expansion of an N-terminal polyalanine tract
produced a similar phenotype; in the fifth family, a missense mutation,
which altered an invariant domain, produced an exceptionally severe limb
phenotype; and in the sixth family, in which limb abnormalities were
atypical, no HOXA13 mutation was detected.

The polyalanine expansion reported by Goodman et al. (2000) occurred in
exon 1 following nucleotide 388 and resulting in the in-frame insertion
of 24-bp and an additional 8 alanine residues (142959.0003). Utsch et
al. (2002) reported a similar in-frame expansion of 6 alanines also in
exon 1, following nucleotide 376, of the HOXA13 gene. They pointed out
that expansion by 7 up to 14 alanine residues occurs in the HOXD13 gene,
resulting in synpolydactyly.

Guttmacher syndrome (176305) has a number of features in common with
hand-foot-genital syndrome, including hypoplastic thumbs and halluces,
fifth-finger clinobrachydactyly, and hypospadias. However, 2 of its
features, postaxial polydactyly of the hands and short or uniphalangeal
second toes with absent nails, had never been observed in patients with
hand-foot-genital syndrome. Because of the similarities, Innis et al.
(2002) reinvestigated the family originally described by Guttmacher
(1993). They found that affected individuals were heterozygous for a
novel missense mutation in the HOXA13 homeobox (Q50L; 142959.0005),
which arose on an allele already carrying a novel 2-bp deletion
(involving GC at positions -78 and -79) in the gene's highly conserved
promoter region. This promoter deletion produces no detectable
abnormalities on its own, but may have contributed to the phenotype in
the affected individuals. The missense mutation, which altered a key
residue in the recognition helix of the homeodomain, is likely to
perturb HOXA13's DNA-binding properties, resulting in both a loss and a
specific gain of function.

ANIMAL MODEL

Mortlock et al. (1996) found a 50-bp deletion in the first exon of the
Hoxa13 gene in mice with the semidominant mutation 'Hypodactyly' (Hd).
The mutation was known to map to a genetic interval overlapping the Hoxa
cluster on mouse chromosome 6. They stated that the deletion probably
arose from unequal recombination between triplet repeats.

Innis et al. (2004) performed homologous recombination in murine
embryonic stem cells to expand the size of the third largest polyalanine
tract by 10 residues. Mutant mice were indistinguishable from
Hoxa13-null mice. Mutant limb buds had normal steady-state Hoxa13 RNA
expression, normal mRNA splicing, and reduced levels of steady-state
protein. In vitro translation efficiency of the mutant protein was
normal. Innis et al. (2004) concluded that loss of function was
secondary to reduced levels of the expanded protein in vivo, likely due
to degradation.

Late limb buds of all tetrapods contain 3 proximodistal segments, each
expressing specific homeobox genes. The stylopod (upper limb) expresses
Meis1/2 (see 601739), the zeugopod (lower limb) expresses Hoxa11
(142958), and the autopod (hand/foot) Hoxa13, although none of these
markers is sufficient to specify limb-segment identity (summary by
Rosello-Diez et al., 2011). Cooper et al. (2011) showed that Wnt3a
(606359), Fgf8 (600483), and retinoic acid act together to maintain
markers of early limb mesenchyme in culture. Rosello-Diez et al. (2011)
showed that the first limb bud proximodistal regionalization results
from the balance between proximal and distal signals. The results of
both groups suggested that retinoic acid is the trunk proximalizing
signal and that the trigger for initiating the process of specification
of the zeugopod and autopod is the cessation (due to displacement) of
retinoic acid exposure, and argued against a mechanism linking
proximodistal specification to a cell cycle-based internal clock.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HAND-FOOT-GENITAL SYNDROME
HOXA13, TRP369TER

Mortlock and Innis (1997) found that patients with the hand-foot-genital
syndrome (140000) in the family reported by Stern et al. (1970) had an
A-to-G transition in a highly conserved tryptophan codon in the HOXA13
homeodomain, which, in addition to causing a trp369-to-ter substitution
(TGG to TGA), also destroyed a NlaIV restriction site. The nonsense
mutation was predicted to produce a truncated protein missing 20
C-terminal amino acids based on homology to other homeodomains whose
3-dimensional structures had been determined. This portion of the normal
homeodomain folds into the last of the 3 alpha-helices. This helix is
critical for DNA binding. The authors noted that the tryptophan that was
mutated in this family is the only amino acid which is invariant in all
known homeodomain proteins.

.0002
HAND-FOOT-GENITAL SYNDROME
HOXA13, 407A-C

Goodman et al. (2000) identified a nonsense truncating mutation in a
male patient who had hand and foot abnormalities typical of
hand-foot-genital syndrome (140000), as well as a short penis tethered
inferiorly to the scrotal sac. The predicted truncated protein in this
individual lacked the entire homeodomain of the HOXA13 protein. The
proband was heterozygous for an A-to-C substitution in exon 1 at base
407 (number of bases starting at the first residue of the initiated
codon). The mutation converted a serine residue to a stop codon and was
predicted to result in a truncated protein containing only the first 135
amino acids of the wildtype protein.

.0003
HAND-FOOT-GENITAL SYNDROME
HOXA13, 24-BP INS, 8-ALA EXP

In the family with hand-foot-genital syndrome (140000) in multiple
generations reported by Elias et al. (1978), Verp (1989), and Donnenfeld
et al. (1992), Goodman et al. (2000) found that affected members were
heterozygous for a 24-bp in-frame insertion in exon 1 at nucleotide 387
of the HOXA13 gene. This insertion occurred in a stretch of 18 imperfect
trinucleotide repeats encoding the third of 3 N-terminal polyalanine
tracts. It probably had arisen by duplication of repeats 7-14 and
expanded the tract from 18 to 26 alanines (8-alanine expansion).

.0004
HAND-FOOT-GENITAL SYNDROME
HOXA13, ASN51HIS

In an isolated case of hand-foot-genital syndrome (140000), Goodman et
al. (2000) identified a heterozygous A-to-C substitution in exon 2 at
nucleotide 1114 of the HOXA13 gene, resulting in an asp51-to-his amino
acid substitution. The affected individual had severe hand and foot
abnormalities, including extremely short thumbs, absent halluces, and
marked hypoplasia of all middle phalanges, as well as glanular
hypospadias. The authors stated that this was the first missense
mutation identified in a human HOX protein.

.0005
GUTTMACHER SYNDROME
HOXA13, GLN50LEU, 2-BP DEL, -79GC

In the original family described by Guttmacher (1993) with preaxial
deficiency, postaxial polydactyly, and hypospadias (Guttmacher syndrome;
176305), Innis et al. (2002) found a novel missense mutation in the
HOXA13 homeobox cDNA: an A-to-T transition at position 1112A-T,
producing a gln50-to-leu (Q50L) amino acid substitution in the
homeodomain of the protein and arising on an allele already carrying a
novel 2-bp deletion in the promoter region of the gene. The promoter
deletion of GC at position -78 and -79 produces no detectable
abnormalities on its own, but was thought to contribute to the phenotype
in the affected individuals.

.0006
HAND-FOOT-GENITAL SYNDROME
HOXA13, 18-BP INS, 6-ALA EXP

In affected members of a family with hand-foot-genital syndrome
(140000), Utsch et al. (2002) found an 18-bp in-frame duplication within
a cryptic trinucleotide repeat sequence encoding an 18-residue
polyalanine tract in the HOXA13 gene, resulting in a 6-alanine
expansion. The family came to attention because of an affected son
admitted to hospital for correction of glanular hypospadias. He showed
small hands with short thumbs, brachydactyly of the fifth fingers, and
hypoplastic thenar eminences, as well as small feet with short great
toes and medially deviated toes. The mother and grandmother showed the
same anomalous distal limb findings. Ultrasonography visualized a uterus
bicornus unicollis with double cervix in both the mother and
grandmother. In addition, the mother showed a longitudinal vaginal
septum, explaining the necessity for cesarean section for the birth of
both her children.

.0007
HAND-FOOT-GENITAL SYNDROME
HOXA13, 27-BP INS, 9-ALA EXP

In affected members of a 3-generation family with hand-foot-genital
syndrome (140000), Debeer et al. (2002) identified a 27-bp in-frame
insertion in the HOXA13 gene, resulting in expansion of the third of the
HOXA13 protein's 3 N-terminal polyalanine tracts from 18 to 27 residues
(9-alanine expansion). An affected member of this family married a
member of another family in which mild synpolydactyly (186000) was
caused by a missense mutation in the HOXD13 gene (142989.0007). The
couple produced a girl heterozygous for both mutations who had digital
abnormalities strikingly more severe than those in carriers of either
individual mutation, indicating that the 2 mutations acted
synergistically.

.0008
HAND-FOOT-GENITAL SYNDROME
HOXA13, 42-BP INS, 14-ALA EXP

In a father and daughter with hand-foot-genital syndrome (140000), Utsch
et al. (2007) identified a heterozygous 42-bp insertion in the HOXA13
gene, resulting in the addition of 14 alanine residues into polyalanine
tract III, which is usually 18 alanine residues in length. Transient
cellular expression studies showed that the expanded protein formed
cytoplasmic aggregates that sequestered both wildtype HOXA13 and
wildtype HOXD13 (142989). The daughter had additional clinical features,
including tethered spinal cord with neurogenic bladder and unilateral
talipes equinovarus.

608387	TITLE *608387 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 213; ZNF213
;;CR53
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

C2H2 zinc finger proteins, such as ZNF213, have bipartite structures in
which one domain binds DNA or RNA and the other modulates target gene
expression.

CLONING

By sequencing candidate genes within the FMF locus (249100) on
chromosome 16, PCR of fetal brain, fetal liver, and lymph node cDNA
libraries, and screening a peripheral blood leukocyte cDNA library, Chen
et al. (1999) cloned ZNF213. The deduced 424-amino acid protein contains
an N-terminal leucine-rich domain, followed by a Kruppel-associated box
and C-terminal zinc fingers. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.8-kb
transcript in all tissues examined. Highest expression was detected in
testis, followed by ovary, small intestine, prostate, spleen, thymus,
mucosal lining of colon, and peripheral blood lymphocytes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chen et al. (1999) determined that the ZNF213 gene contains 7 exons and
spans about 8.0 kb. The 5-prime untranslated region is GC rich.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Bernot et al. (1998) mapped the ZNF213
gene, which they designated CR53, to chromosome 16p13.3. The gene is
oriented with its 5-prime end toward the telomere. Chen et al. (1999)
determined that the ZNF213 gene lies within a ZNF gene cluster that
includes ZNF263 (604191) and ZNF174 (603900).

613914	TITLE *613914 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 746; ZNF746
;;PARKIN-INTERACTING SUBSTRATE; PARIS
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using parkin (PARK2; 602544) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a
human brain cDNA library, Shin et al. (2011) cloned ZNF746, which they
called PARIS. The deduced 644-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal
Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) and a C-terminal C2HC/C2H2-type zinc
finger. Northern blot analysis of human tissues and immunoblot analysis
of mouse tissues showed ubiquitous expression of PARIS.
Immunohistochemical analysis of mouse brain showed that Paris localized
to neurons. PARIS colocalized with parkin in cell bodies in primary rat
cortical neurons and in human SH-SY5Y dopaminergic-like cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Shin et al. (2011) showed that PARIS coimmunoprecipitated with parkin
from whole human striatum or mouse brain. Domain mapping indicated that
parkin bound to the C-terminal domain of PARIS. In SH-SY5Y cells, parkin
ubiquitinated epitope-tagged PARIS on lys48 in the presence of various
E2 enzymes (see 601661), leading to PARIS degradation via the proteasome
system. PARIS levels were elevated in the cingulate cortex of patients
with autosomal recessive parkinson disease (PD) (600116), in the
striatum and substantia nigra of patients with sporadic PD, and in an
adult mouse PD model following conditional parkin knockout. Using a pool
of random oligonucleotides with immobilized PARIS, followed by
electrophoretic mobility shift assays, Shin et al. (2011) showed that
PARIS bound the core sequence TATTTT(T/G), which is an insulin response
sequence (IRS) designated the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK;
see 261680)-like motif (PLM). PARIS also bound the 5-prime region of the
transcriptional coactivator PGC1-alpha (PPARGC1A; 604517), which
contains 3 IRS/PLM elements. PARIS repressed PGC1-alpha expression in
SH-SY5Y cells and in control and PD postmortem striatum, and it altered
the expression of a subset of PGC1-alpha-regulated genes, particularly
NRF1 (600879). Conditional parkin knockout in mouse led to Pgc1-alpha
and Nrf1 downregulation concomitant with Paris upregulation. Knockout of
Paris expression in parkin-knockout mice reduced the degeneration of
dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Conversely, overexpression of Paris in
substantia nigra of wildtype mice resulted in degeneration of DA neurons
and reduced expression of Pgcl1-alpha and Nrf1. Shin et al. (2011)
concluded that PARIS is predominantly expressed in the nigrostriatal
pathway and may contribute to the pathophysiology of PD.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the ZNF746 gene to chromosome 7q36.1 based on an
alignment of the ZNF746 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK055975) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

157680	TITLE *157680 CELL DIVISION CYCLE 25C; CDC25C
;;MITOSIS INDUCER CDC25; CDC25
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The cell division cycle 25 (CDC25) family of proteins are highly
conserved dual specificity phosphatases that activate cyclin-dependent
kinase (CDK) complexes, which in turn regulate progression through the
cell division cycle. CDC25 phosphatases are also key components of the
checkpoint pathways that become activated in the event of DNA damage. In
mammalian cells, 3 isoforms have been identified: CDC25A (116947),
CDC25B (116949), and CDC25C. CDC25B and CDC25C are required primarily
for entry into mitosis. CDC25B is proposed to be responsible for the
initial activation of CDK1 (116940)-cyclin B (123836) at the centrosome
during the G2-M transition, which is then followed by a complete
activation of CDK1-cyclin B complexes by CDC25C in the nucleus at the
onset of mitosis (summary by Boutros et al., 2007).

CLONING

Sadhu et al. (1990) used sequence similarities between homologs of cdc25
in yeast and in Drosophila to design oligonucleotide sets that were then
used to clone a human cdc25 homolog by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
The product of the human cdc25 homolog shared a conserved C-terminal
domain with the yeast and Drosophila cdc25 proteins. Furthermore, the
human cdc25 homolog rescued a fission yeast temperature-sensitive mutant
form of cdc25, indicating functional as well as structural conservation
of cdc25 homologs. They showed that the human homolog, termed CDC25, is
expressed predominantly in G2 phase in healer cells. The human gene
encodes a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 53,000 daltons
whose C-terminal domain shares about 37% sequence identity with the
fission yeast cdc25 mitotic inducer.

GENE FUNCTION

Gould et al. (1990) demonstrated that the CDC25 gene product is a
protein-tyrosine phosphatase. Strausfeld et al. (1991) found that the
human CDC25 protein activates a partially purified p34(cdc2)/cyclin B
complex (116940). The cdc25 protein also shares homology with a protein
phosphatase with activity against both tyrosine and serine (and thus
probably threonine) phosphate residues (Moreno and Nurse, 1991).

Bulavin et al. (2001) reported that p38 kinase (600289) has a critical
role in the initiation of a G2 delay after ultraviolet radiation.
Inhibition of p38 blocks the rapid initiation of this checkpoint in both
human and murine cells after ultraviolet radiation. In vitro, p38 binds
and phosphorylates CDC25B (116949) at serines 309 and 361, and CDC25C at
serine-216; phosphorylation of these residues is required for binding to
14-3-3 proteins (see 113508). In vivo, inhibition of p38 prevents both
phosphorylation of CDC25B at serine-309 and 14-3-3 binding after
ultraviolet radiation, and mutation of this site is sufficient to
inhibit the checkpoint initiation. In contrast, in vivo CDC25C binding
to 14-3-3 is not affected by p38 inhibition after ultraviolet radiation.
Bulavin et al. (2001) proposed that regulation of CDC25B phosphorylation
by p38 is a critical event for initiating the G2/M checkpoint after
ultraviolet radiation.

Raj et al. (2001) reported that adeno-associated virus (AAV) selectively
induces apoptosis in cells that lack active p53 (191170). Cells with
intact p53 activity are not killed but undergo arrest in the G2 phase of
the cell cycle. This arrest is characterized by an increase in p53
activity and p21 (116899) levels and by the targeted destruction of
CDC25C. Neither cell killing nor arrest depends upon AAV-encoded
proteins. Rather, AAV DNA, which is single stranded with hairpin
structures at both ends, elicits in cells a DNA damage response that, in
the absence of p53, leads to cell death.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization using a cDNA isolated by Sadhu et
al. (1990), Sartor et al. (1992) mapped the CDC25C gene to 5q31. Using
fluorescence in situ hybridization, Taviaux and Demaille (1993) likewise
found that the CDC25C gene maps to 5q31. By pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis for creation of a physical map, Willman et al. (1993)
demonstrated that the CDC25C gene is located about 100 kb telomeric to
IRF1 (147575).

300061	TITLE *300061 ZINC FINGER, MYM-TYPE 3; ZMYM3
;;ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 261; ZNF261;;
DXS6673E
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Van der Maarel et al. (1996) reported the cloning and characterization
of the ZNF261 gene, which the called DXS6673E. ZNF261 maps to the X
chromosome, is subject to X inactivation, and was disrupted in the
5-prime untranslated region by a balanced X;13 translocation in a
mentally retarded female. They identified a YAC clone that spanned the
breakpoint and used this YAC to isolate a cDNA from a fetal brain
library. The cDNA contains a 4,074-bp ORF encoding a predicted
1,358-amino acid polypeptide. By Northern analysis, van der Maarel et
al. (1996) showed that the DXS6673E gene is highly conserved among
vertebrates and that its expression is most abundant in brain.

GENE FUNCTION

Hakimi et al. (2003) identified a family of multiprotein corepressor
complexes that function through modifying chromatin structure to keep
genes silent. The polypeptide composition of these complexes includes a
common core of 2 subunits, HDAC1 (601241)/HDAC2 (605164) and the
FAD-binding protein BHC110 (AOF2; 609132). Other subunits of these
complexes include ZNF261, GTF2I (601679), and polypeptides associated
with cancer-causing chromosomal translocations.

GENE STRUCTURE

Van der Maarel et al. (1996) reported that the ZNF261 gene contains 25
exons, including 2 putative alternatively spliced noncoding exons (1A
and 1B).

MAPPING

Van der Maarel et al. (1996) mapped the ZNF261 gene to chromosome
Xq13.1.

CYTOGENETICS

Van der Maarel et al. (1996) reported a mentally retarded female whose
ZNF261 gene was disrupted in the 5-prime UTR by a balanced X;13
translocation. They noted that apart from mental retardation, the only
conspicuous clinical features in this patient were scoliosis and spotty
abdominal hypopigmentation.
