DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Zinc finger proteins (ZNFs), which bind nucleic acids, perform many key
functions, the most important of which is regulating transcription. See
ZNF91 (603971) for general information on ZNFs.

CLONING

By PCR-based screening of a human genomic YAC library using degenerate
oligonucleotides corresponding to a consensus sequence of the spacer
region of ZNF91 family members, Bellefroid et al. (1993) identified 23
distinct ZNF91-related genes, including ZNF107. They demonstrated that
members of the ZNF91 family are widely expressed in human tissues, with
the highest expression in T-lymphoid cells.

By sequence analysis of a human aorta-specific cDNA, followed by 5-prime
RACE of human brain cDNA, Li et al. (1999) cloned ZNF107, which they
called ZFD25. The deduced 783-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 90.67 kD and contains 25 C2H2-type zinc fingers.
ZNF107 shares 70% homology with both ZNF91 and ZNF117 (194624). The
5-prime untranslated region contains a KRAB domain. Northern blot
analysis detected a 6.2-kb transcript in human brain, heart, skeletal
muscle, kidney, and pancreas. RT-PCR analysis detected expression in
human aorta, liver, lung, and cultured umbilical vein endothelial cells,
umbilical artery smooth muscle cells, and HepG2 cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Li et al. (1999) showed that ZNF107 expression in cultured human
umbilical vein endothelial cells decreased in response to a shift from
20% fetal calf serum to serum-free media. They suggested that ZNF107 may
play a role in serum-dependent cellular processes, such as cell
proliferation and survival.

MAPPING

By FISH, Bellefroid et al. (1993) mapped a YAC clone containing the
ZNF107 gene to 7q11.2.
