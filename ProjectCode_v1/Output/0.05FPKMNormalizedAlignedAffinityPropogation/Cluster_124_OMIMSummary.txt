;;K19;;
KERATIN, TYPE I, 40-KD
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Keratin proteins belong to 2 families: acidic (or type I) and basic (or
type II). As a rule they are coordinately synthesized in pairs so that
at least 1 member of each family is expressed in each epithelial cell.
For example, keratins 1 (KRT1; 139350) and 10 (KRT10; 148080) are
specific for the epidermis, keratins 3 (KRT3; 148043) and 12 (KRT12;
601687) for cornea, keratins 6 (KRT6; see 148041) and 16 (KRT16; 148067)
for hyperproliferative conditions of the epidermis, etc. The most
striking exception to the keratin-pair rule is the smallest known (40
kD) acidic keratin, KRT19. This keratin is found in the periderm, the
transient superficial layer that envelopes the developing epidermis. It
is expressed often in epithelial cells in culture and in some
carcinomas. Although its alpha-helical central domain fully conforms to
the canonical structure of all keratins, KRT19 is unique because it
completely lacks a C-terminal nonhelical extension (summary by
Savtchenko et al., 1988).

CLONING

Bader et al. (1986) and Stasiak and Lane (1987) sequenced human cDNA for
KRT19.

Eckert (1988) reported that the amino acid sequence of the human 40-kD
keratin has 89% overall identity of amino acid sequence to the
corresponding bovine keratin, suggesting that there is strong
evolutionary pressure to conserve the structure of this keratin. This in
turn suggests an important and universal role for this intermediate
filament subunit in all species.

Langbein et al. (2005) examined the expression of several keratins in
eccrine sweat gland and in plantar epidermis. In the sweat gland, KRT19
was expressed throughout the duct region and also in the deeper
secretory portion of the gland. In plantar epidermis, KRT19 was
expressed only in the stratum corneum through to the middle suprabasal
layer.

In the early murine embryo, 2 keratin proteins, Krt8 (148060) and Krt18
(148070) are coordinately expressed as cytoskeletal components at the 4-
to 8-cell stage. Comparable data for human embryos do not exist,
although several processed pseudogenes corresponding to KRT8 and KRT18
have been discovered in the human genome. Processed pseudogenes arose
from integration of reverse transcripts of RNA into the genome. They
lack completely the intervening sequences found in functional genes.
Only those genes that are expressed in germline and pre-germline cells
to make functional mRNA can have processed pseudogenes. The mRNAs
expressed only in differentiated cells do not produce processed
pseudogenes. Therefore, the existence of a correctly initiated and
processed pseudogene is ipso facto evidence for expression of the
corresponding gene in early-embryo or germline cells. Savtchenko et al.
(1988) found in the human genome a processed pseudogene corresponding to
KRT19. This implies expression of KRT19 in addition to KRT8 and KRT18 in
the early human embryo. Blumenberg (1988) proposed that keratin 19
evolved specifically to redress unbalanced production of various basic
keratins, and the findings of Savtchenko et al. (1988) suggest that it
may fulfill the same role during human embryogenesis.

GENE FUNCTION

Eckert (1988) noted that KRT19 expression is increased by vitamin A
treatment of cultured human keratinocytes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Von Frowein et al. (2011) presented evidence suggesting that a mature
microRNA, MIR492 (see 614384), can be processed from the coding sequence
of the KRT19 gene. The miRNA precursor sequence is located within exons
1 and 2 of KRT19 and is 93% identical to the MIR492 precursor sequence
located within the KRT19 pseudogene on chromosome 17. Both MIR492
precursors yield identical mature sequences. Von Frowein et al. (2011)
identified several functional PLAG1 (603026)-binding sites within intron
1 and the 3-prime UTR of the KRT19 gene.

MAPPING

Bader et al. (1988) mapped KRT19 to chromosome 17.

Ceratto et al. (1997) concluded that the KRT13 (148065), KRT14 (148066),
KRT15 (148030), and KRT16 genes and the linked type I genes KRT17
(148069) and KRT19 are contained in less than 150 kb of genomic DNA in
the region 17q21-q22.

Lussier et al. (1990) found close homology between the mouse gene and
the human and bovine KRT19 genes. Furthermore, they demonstrated that
the gene is located on mouse chromosome 11 with the other type-I
keratin-encoding genes.

;;SERINE/THREONINE PROTEIN KINASE 22C; STK22C;;
STK22D, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; STK22D
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using degenerate primers corresponding to 2 highly conserved protein
kinase motifs, Visconti et al. (2001) cloned mouse Stk22d by PCR. Using
this sequence as query, they identified an EST containing the human
homolog of Stk22d, STK22C, and they obtained the full-length cDNA by
3-prime and 5-prime RACE of a testis cDNA library. The mouse and human
proteins contain 268 amino acids and share 100% amino acid homology.
Northern blot analysis of 8 human tissues detected transcripts of 1.0
and 1.35 kb only in testis. Transcription of Stk22d in mouse testis
began 20 to 24 days after birth. In adult mouse testis, expression was
detected in round and condensing spermatids, but not in meiotic
pachytene spermatocytes.

MAPPING

By FISH, Visconti et al. (2001) mapped the STK22C gene to chromosome
1p35-p34. They mapped its mouse homolog, Stk22d, to chromosome 4E1 in a
region showing homology of synteny to human 1p35-p34.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The CYP1A2 gene encodes a P450 enzyme involved in O-deethylation of
phenacetin. It is 1 of several forms of cytochrome P-450 that have been
purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from human liver microsomes
(Guengerich et al., 1986). P1-450 (CYP1A1; 108330) and P3-450 are 2
members of the dioxin-inducible P450 gene family.

CLONING

Jaiswal et al. (1987) isolated a cDNA corresponding to the CYP1A2 gene.
The deduced 515-residue protein has a molecular mass of 583 kD.
Phenacetin O-deethylase differs from another cytochrome P-450 enzyme
that shows genetic polymorphism, debrisoquine 4-hydroxylase (124030), in
molecular mass, amino acid composition, catalytic activity, and
immunochemical properties.

Butler et al. (1989) reviewed the evidence that phenacetin O-deethylase,
otherwise known as P450(PA), is the product of the CYP1A2 gene.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ikeya et al. (1989) found that the human CYP1A2 gene spans almost 7.8 kb
and contains 7 exons. The first exon is noncoding exon. Between CYP1A2
and CYP1A1, exons 2, 4, 6, and especially 5 are strikingly conserved in
both nucleotides and total number of bases. The regulatory elements of
the 2 genes, however, appeared to differ in location.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis, Jaiswal et al. (1987) determined that
both the P3-450 and the P1-450 loci reside on human chromosome 15. In
the mouse and hamster, the 2 genes are located near the equivalent of
the mannosephosphate isomerase (MPI) locus (154550). The same may be
true in man; MPI is located in the region 15q22-qter. The 2 CYP1 genes
are within 25 kb of each other and probably are not separated by other
genes (Nebert, 1988).

GENE FUNCTION

More than 20 clinically used drugs are partly or predominantly
metabolized by CYP1A2 including caffeine, theophylline, imipramine,
clozapine, and propranolol. CYP1A2 accounts for nearly 15% of the
cytochrome P450 in the human liver (Shimada et al., 1994). CYP1A2
displays higher activity in men than in women, and is inhibited by oral
contraceptives. Inducers of CYP1A2 include cruciferous vegetables
(Vistisen et al., 1992). Cigarette smoking has also been shown to
increase CYP1A2 activity (Sesardic et al., 1988).

Butler et al. (1989) reported that human hepatic microsomal caffeine
3-demethylation, the initial major step in caffeine biotransformation in
humans, is selectively catalyzed by CYP1A2. The authors suggested that
variation in caffeine 3-demethylation activity in humans could be used
to characterize arylamine N-oxidation phenotypes, which may play a role
in interindividual susceptibility to arylamine-induced cancers. For
example, smokers have been demonstrated to have increased rates of
caffeine disposition, with plasma half lives one-half that of
nonsmokers. Furthermore, rates of caffeine metabolism vary between
individuals, as caffeine half-life values ranging from 1.5 to 9.5 hours
have been reported.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Shahidi (1967) described the familial occurrence of acetophenetidin
susceptibility, suggesting genetic factors in the effects of CYP1A2.

Devonshire et al. (1983) demonstrated a genetic polymorphism for
phenacetin O-deethylation, with 5 to 10% of the population deficient in
this activity.

In human liver samples, Ikeya et al. (1989) found more than 15-fold
differences in levels of CYP1A2 mRNA, and Schweikl et al. (1993)
observed more than 40-fold differences. These findings indicated a
genetically-determined difference in constitutive and/or inducible
CYP1A2 gene expression.

Nakajima et al. (1999) and Sachse et al. (1999) reported single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CYP1A2 gene causing high
inducibility.

Among 786 Caucasian individuals tested for caffeine clearance derived
from saliva concentrations, Tantcheva-Poor et al. (1999) found that
CYP1A2 activity was influenced by the amount of coffee drunk daily,
smoking, and country of residence, activities being lower in Bulgaria
and Slovakia than in Germany. These and other covariates studied
explained 37% of overall variation. No relative polymorphism was found
for CYP1A2 activity when adjusted for covariate effects.

Rasmussen et al. (2002) determined the caffeine ratio in a 6-hour urine
sample from 378 Danish twin pairs following oral intake of a single dose
of 200 mg of caffeine. The mean caffeine ratio was 5.9 +/- 3.4. The
caffeine ratio was statistically significantly higher in men compared to
women, in smoking men and women compared to nonsmoking persons of the
same gender, and in women not taking oral contraceptives compared with
women on oral contraceptives.

In a study of heritability, Rasmussen et al. (2002) investigated 49
monozygotic twin pairs and 34 same gender dizygotic twin pairs
concordant for nonsmoking and non-use of oral contraceptives. A
biometrical model for the caffeine ratio including only additive genetic
factors and unique environmental factors was the overall best-fitting
model. The heritability estimate based on this model was 0.725; unique
environmental effects seemed to account for the remaining 0.275.

Individuals with the most common form of porphyria, porphyria cutanea
tarda (PCT; 176100), are believed to be genetically predisposed to
development of clinically overt disease through mutations and
polymorphisms in genes associated with known precipitating factors.
Christiansen et al. (2000) examined a group of Danish patients with PCT
for the presence of a C/A polymorphism in intron 1 of CYP1A2. The
results demonstrated that the frequency of the highly inducible A/A
genotype is increased in both familial and sporadic PCT. The authors
suggested that the A/A genotype is a susceptibility factor for PCT.

Wooding et al. (2002) studied SNPs in the CYP1A2 gene in 113 individuals
from 3 major continental regions of the Old World (Africa, Asia, and
Europe), in comparison with the sequences in the 90-member National
Institutes of Health DNA Polymorphism Discovery Resource. The African
population had the highest level of nucleotide diversity, the lowest
level of linkage disequilibrium, and 2 distinct haplotype clusters with
broadly overlapping geographic distributions. Haplotypes found outside
of Africa were mostly a subset of those found within Africa. These
patterns were all consistent with the African origin of modern humans.

Browning et al. (2010) sequenced the CYP1A2 gene from buccal swab DNA
samples from 381 adults nearly equally divided between 5 Ethiopian
ethnic groups representing an approximate northeast-to-southwest
transect across the country. They identified 49 different variable
sites, including 9 nonsynonymous changes, 7 of which were novel, and 1
synonymous change, and 55 different haplotypes, 52 of which were novel.
None of the variant sites occurred near intron/exon boundaries, and all
reported catalytic residues (i.e., asp320 and thr321 in exon 4 and
phe451 and cys458 in exon 7) were monomorphic. Most individuals had at
least 1 copy of the ancestral haplotype. However, Ethiopian groups
displayed twice the variation seen in all other population groups
combined. Browning et al. (2010) concluded that, consistent with the
hypothesis of Africa, in general, and Ethiopia, in particular, being the
birthplace of mankind, genetic diversity is greater in this population
and that this diversity has significant implications for health care
interventions in terms of increased risk of adverse drug reactions.

ANIMAL MODEL

In mice, Buters et al. (1996) showed that the clearance of caffeine is
determined primarily by Cyp1a2.

CYP1A2 substrates include aflatoxin B1, acetaminophen, and a variety of
environmental arylamines. To define better the developmental and
metabolic functions of this enzyme, Liang et al. (1996) developed a
CYP1A2-deficient mouse line by homologous recombination in embryonic
stem cells. Mice homozygous for the targeted Cyp1a2 gene were completely
viable and fertile; histologic examination of 15-day embryos, newborn
pups, and 3-week-old mice revealed no abnormalities. No CYP1A2 mRNA was
detected by Northern blot analysis. Moreover, mRNA levels of Cyp1a1, the
other gene in the same subfamily, appeared unaffected by loss of the
Cyp1a2 gene. Because the muscle relaxant zoxazolamine is a known
substrate for CYP1A2, they studied the knockout animals by using the
zoxazolamine test. The knockout mice exhibited dramatically lengthened
paralysis times relative to wildtype mice and the heterozygotes showed
an intermediate effect.

Paolini et al. (1999) found significant increases in the
carcinogen-metabolizing enzymes CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP3A (124010), CYP2B
(123930), and CYP2A (see 122720) in the lungs of rats supplemented with
high doses of beta-carotene. The authors suggested that correspondingly
high levels of CYPs in humans would predispose an individual to cancer
risk from the widely bioactivated tobacco-smoke procarcinogens, thus
explaining the cocarcinogenic effect of beta-carotene in smokers.

;;CHROMOSOME 6 OPEN READING FRAME 27; C6ORF27;;
G7C
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Albertella et al. (1996) probed the intergenic region adjacent to G7A
(VARS; 192150). Exon trapping succeeded in identifying 2 exons
comprising 232 bp of G7C. Using sequence analysis, Snoek et al. (2000)
showed that an 85% identical gene is located in the syntenic region of
the mouse MHC. The mouse G7c cDNA totals 4.3 kb and encodes an 891-amino
acid protein. RT-PCR analysis revealed low level expression in all mouse
tissues tested. The human cDNA identified by Albertella et al. (1996)
and the nucleotide sequence of mouse exons 6 through 16 are 82%
identical, and their predicted proteins are 76% identical and 81%
similar over 536 amino acids. Snoek et al. (2000) noted that the G7c
gene harbors a recombinatorial hotspot within the mouse class III
region.

MAPPING

Albertella et al. (1996) mapped the G7C gene to chromosome 6p21.33
between G7A and G7D. Snoek et al. (2000) identified 17 exons in the
mouse G7c gene.

;;ATP6IP1;;
ATP6S1;;
VACUOLAR ATPase SUBUNIT 1; VATPS1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The vacuolar proton-ATPase (V-ATPase) is composed of a catalytic and a
membrane sector. See 603717. Supek et al. (1994) identified a 45-kD
component of V-ATPase from bovine chromaffin granules and cloned the
corresponding gene. The predicted 468-amino acid bovine protein, which
they called Ac45, contains an N-terminal signal sequence and a
C-terminal transmembrane domain.

Independently, Sedlacek et al. (1993), Yokoi et al. (1994), and Chen et
al. (1996) identified the human homolog of Ac45 as an open reading frame
on chromosome Xq28. They designated the human gene XAP3, CF2, and
VATPS1, respectively. Using Northern blot analysis, Yokoi et al. (1994)
demonstrated that CF2 was expressed as a 2.6-kb mRNA in all tissues
tested.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chen et al. (1996) reported that the VATPS1 gene contains 9 exons with
an additional possible exon at the 3-prime end.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Sedlacek et al. (1993), Yokoi et al. (1994), and
Chen et al. (1996) mapped the ATP6AP1 gene to chromosome Xq28.

142765	TITLE *142765 REGULATORY FACTOR X, 2; RFX2
;;HLA CLASS II REGULATORY FACTOR RFX2
DESCRIPTION Pugliatti et al. (1992) noted that the expression of HLA class II genes
(DR, DQ, and DP) is controlled primarily by cis-acting DNA motifs
located within the 150 bp upstream of the genes and in particular by 2
highly conserved sequences, the X and Y boxes. Several protein factors
bind to these cis-acting sequences. RFX is of special interest since a
specific defect in its binding to target DNA sequence has been observed
in patients with HLA class II deficient combined immunodeficiency (see
209920). Overexpression of RFX in transfected cells transactivates an
HLA class II promoter, and antisense RNA expressed in transfected cells
inhibits the expression of HLA-DR genes. A closely related form of RFX,
referred to as RFX2, has also been isolated.

The RFX1 (600006) gene product is a transactivator of the human
hepatitis B viral enhancer I. Reith et al. (1994) commented that the RFX
family members, particularly RFX1 and RFX3 (601337), constitute the
nuclear complexes referred to previously as enhancer factor C (EF-C),
EP, and methylation-dependent DNA-binding protein (MDBP), or
rpL30-alpha. Reith et al. (1994) identified and cloned 3 members of this
gene family from both human and mouse using lambda gt11 cDNA libraries.
The gene encoding human RFX2 encodes a 721-amino acid polypeptide.
Homology between the 3 RFX proteins is restricted largely to 5 conserved
regions, including the 2 domains required for DNA binding and
dimerization. Reith et al. (1994) found that RFX1, RFX2, and RFX3 have
similar DNA-binding specificities. The RFX monomers can heterodimerize
both in vivo and in vitro, but all 3 are capable of binding DNA as
monomers. They showed that the RFX2 transcript is particularly elevated
in mouse testis.

By in situ hybridization with a biotinylated genomic cosmid clone
Pugliatti et al. (1992) localized RFX2 to 19p13.3-p13.2. Doyle et al.
(1996) physically mapped RFX2 to cosmid contigs for chromosome 19. The
gene was localized between FUT5 (136835) and MLLT1 (159556).

Doyle et al. (1996) used interspecific backcross mapping to place Rfx2
near the distal end of mouse chromosome 17 near C3 and Vav.

604675	TITLE *604675 PAIRED-RELATED HOMEOBOX GENE 2; PRRX2
;;PAIRED-LIKE HOMEOBOX GENE 2; PRX2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By use of semiquantitative RT-PCR with degenerate primers to identify
homeobox-related genes (see HOXB13, 604607) in second-trimester fetal
fibroblasts, followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE, Stelnicki et al.
(1998) identified a partial cDNA, which they designated PRX2, that is
differentially expressed during fetal versus adult wound healing. The
composite 813-nucleotide cDNA encodes a putative 164-amino acid protein
with 74% overall identity to mouse Prx2, showing high conservation in
the homeodomain and extreme 3-prime region. Northern blot analysis
revealed that PRX2 is expressed as a single 1.3-kb transcript. RNAse
protection analysis showed that PRX2 is more strongly expressed in
normal fetal than in adult skin, much more strongly expressed in both
fetal and adult proliferating fibroblasts, and not expressed in
keratinocytes. In situ hybridization analysis revealed weak expression
in fetal skin, concentrated within the dermal papilla of the developing
hair shaft.

Norris et al. (2000) characterized the expression pattern of PRRX2 and
PRRX1 (167420) in human tissues by RT-PCR. Although the expression of
these human genes were similar to their mouse orthologs, there were
notable differences in expression. PRRX2 was detected in human kidney
and lung, whereas in mice and chickens neither of these tissues had been
reported to express Prrx2.

MAPPING

Norris et al. (2000) mapped the PRRX2 gene to 9q34.1 and the PRRX1 gene
to 1q23 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Norris et al. (2000) noted similarities of the observed phenotypes of
gene-targeted Prrx1, Prrx2, and double mutant mice to those of Nager
acrofacial dysostosis (154400), which maps to 9q, and the phenotypically
similar Miller postaxial acrofacial dysostosis (263750). Nager syndrome
patients have preaxial limb deformities and frequent postaxial
hypoplasia, whereas Miller syndrome patients have primarily postaxial
(ulnar and fibular) defects. Both types of abnormalities are observed in
the Prrx1, Prrx2, double mutant mice. In DNA samples from 8 patients
with Nager syndrome and 2 patients with Miller syndrome, Norris et al.
(2000) found no mutations in either of the PRRX genes.

ANIMAL MODEL

Ten Berge et al. (1998) found that, in contrast to Prx1-null mice,
Prx2-null mice showed no skeletal defects. They developed double-mutant
mice and found that inactivation of both Prx1 and Prx2 resulted in many
novel abnormalities in addition to an aggravation of the skeletal
abnormalities seen in Prx1-null mice. There were defects in external,
middle, and inner ear, reduction or loss of skull bones, a reduced and
sometimes cleft mandible, and limb abnormalities that included postaxial
polydactyly and bent zeugopods. A single incisor or no incisor was
present in the lower jaw, and ectopic expression of Fgf8 (600483) and
Pax9 (167416) was found medially in the mandibular arch. Ten Berge et
al. (1998) concluded that the Prx genes are involved in
epitheliomesenchymal interactions in inner ear and lower jaw and in
interactions between perichondrium and chondrocytes in the bones of the
zeugopods.

604198	TITLE *604198 RAS-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN RAB11B; RAB11B
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The Ras superfamily of small GTP-binding proteins, which includes the
Ras (see 190020), Ral (see 179550), Rho (see 165390), Rap (see 179520),
and Rab (see 179508) families, is involved in controlling a diverse set
of essential cellular functions. The Rab family, including RAB11B,
appears to play a critical role in regulating exocytotic and endocytotic
pathways (summary by Zhu et al., 1994).

CLONING

By PCR using degenerate oligonucleotides based on the RAB3D (604350)
amino acid sequence, followed by screening of a human fetal skeletal
muscle cDNA library with the PCR product, Zhu et al. (1994) isolated
cDNAs encoding RAB11B, which they called YPT3, and RAB35 (604199). The
deduced 218-amino acid RAB11B protein is similar to yeast Ypt3, 99%
identical to mouse Ypt3, and 91% identical to human RAB11A (605570).
RAB11B contains the 4 conserved domains important for GTP binding. The C
terminus sequence of RAB11B is similar to that of RAB11A; in Rab
proteins, this region is thought to be involved in membrane association.
Recombinant RAB11B expressed in bacteria had GTP-binding activity.
Northern blot analysis detected a 1.3-kb RAB11B transcript in all human
tissues examined.

604267	TITLE *604267 MULTIPLE EPIDERMAL GROWTH FACTOR-LIKE DOMAINS 8; MEGF8
;;EPIDERMAL GROWTH FACTOR-LIKE 4, FORMERLY; EGFL4, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The domain that characterizes epidermal growth factor (EGF; 131530)
consists of approximately 50 amino acids with 3 disulfide bonds.
EGF-like domains are believed to play a critical role in a number of
extracellular events, including cell adhesion and receptor-ligand
interactions. Proteins with EGF-like domains often consist of more than
1,000 amino acids, have multiple copies of the EGF-like domain, and
contain additional domains known to be involved in specific
protein-protein interactions. To identify proteins containing EGF-like
domains, Nakayama et al. (1998) searched a database of long cDNA
sequences randomly selected from a human brain cDNA library for those
that encode an EGF-like motif. They identified several partial cDNAs
encoding novel proteins with EGF-like domains, such as EGFL4, which they
named MEGF8. The predicted partial EGFL4 protein has a laminin (e.g.,
150240)-type EGF-like domain, 5 EGF-like domains, and a transmembrane
domain.

MAPPING

Using a radiation hybrid mapping panel, Nakayama et al. (1998) mapped
the EGFL4 gene to 19q12.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 4 unrelated probands with a form of Carpenter syndrome frequently
associated with defective lateralization (CRPT2; 614976), Twigg et al.
(2012) identified homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the
MEGF8 gene (see, e.g., 604267.0001-604267.0004).

ANIMAL MODEL

Using N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis in mice, Zhang et al.
(2009) found a recessive phenotype characterized by heterotaxy, complex
congenital heart defects, and preaxial polydactyly that was associated
with a cys193-to-arg (C193R) substitution in the Megf8 gene on mouse
chromosome 7. The authors used massively parallel sequencing to identify
the mutation. The substitution eliminated an invariant cysteine situated
in the second putative EGF domain and could disrupt formation of a
disulfide bond required for proper protein folding. Megf8 transcripts
were ubiquitously expressed in both wildtype and mutant mouse embryos.
Immunostaining showed punctate nuclear localization with Gfi1b (604383)
and Baf60c (SMARCD3; 601737), 2 proteins involved in chromatin
remodeling. Mutant mice showed normal breaking of symmetry at the node,
but Nodal (601265) signaling failed to be propagated to the left lateral
plate mesoderm. Cilia motility was unaffected. Morpholino knockdown of
Megf8 in zebrafish embryos resulted in a heterotaxic phenotype with
discordant heart and gut situs. The findings suggested that MEGF8 is an
essential regulator of left-right patterning.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CARPENTER SYNDROME 2
MEGF8, ARG1499HIS

In a 9-year-old Turkish boy with features of Carpenter syndrome and
dextrocardia (CRPT2; 614976), Twigg et al. (2012) identified
homozygosity for a 4496G-A transition in exon 26 of the MEGF8 gene,
resulting in an arg1499-to-his (R1499H) substitution at a highly
conserved residue in a kelch domain. The mutation was present in
heterozygosity in his unaffected parents and sister, but was not found
in the dbSNP135 or Exome Variant Server databases. In zebrafish
morpholino knockdown experiments, coinjection of the R1499H mutant did
not result in effective rescue compared to wildtype, but the reduced
proportion of epiboly defects (down to 60% from 83%) suggested that the
mutant protein might retain some residual function.

.0002
CARPENTER SYNDROME 2
MEGF8, SER2367GLY

In a 6.5-year-old German girl with features of Carpenter syndrome
(CRPT2; 614976), Twigg et al. (2012) identified compound heterozygosity
for a missense and a nonsense mutation in the MEGF8 gene: a 7099A-G
transition in exon 41, resulting in a ser2367-to-gly (S2367G)
substitution at a highly conserved residue in an EGF-like laminin
domain, and a 1342C-T transition in exon 7, resulting in an
arg448-to-ter (R448X; 604267.0002) substitution. The patient's
unaffected father was heterozygous for the S367G mutation, which was not
found in 192 northern European controls, and her unaffected mother was
heterozygous for the R448X mutation, which was not found in 189 Turkish
controls; neither mutation was found in the dbSNP135 or Exome Variant
Server databases. In zebrafish morpholino knockdown experiments,
coinjection of the S236G mutant did not result in effective rescue
compared to wildtype, but the reduced proportion of epiboly defects
(down to 71% from 83%) suggested that the mutant protein might retain
some residual function.

In a Turkish boy with features of Carpenter syndrome who also exhibited
dextrocardia and situs inversus totalis (CRPT2; 604267), originally
reported by Altunhan et al. (2011), Twigg et al. (2012) identified
homozygosity for a 595G-C transversion in exon 4 of the MEGF8 gene,
resulting in a gly199-to-arg (G199R) substitution at a highly conserved
residue in an EGF domain. The proband's unaffected father and 2
unaffected sisters were heterozygous for the mutation, which was not
found in 189 Turkish controls or in the dbSNP135 or Exome Variant Server
databases; his mother was deceased. In zebrafish morpholino knockdown
experiments, coinjection of the G199R mutant did not result in effective
rescue compared to wildtype, but the reduced proportion of epiboly
defects (down to 73% from 83%) suggested that the mutant protein might
retain some residual function.

153390	TITLE *153390 LYMPHOCYTE-SPECIFIC PROTEIN-TYROSINE KINASE; LCK
;;ONCOGENE LCK;;
p56(LCK)
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The LCK gene encodes p56(LCK), a nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase of
the SRC (190090) oncogene family that is involved in transduction of
T-cell receptor (TCR; see 186880)-mediated activation. The p56(LCK)
protein is anchored to the plasma membrane and interacts with the
intracellular domains of CD4 (186940)/CD8 (see 186910) coreceptors. It
is composed of 4 SRC homology (SH) domains that are variably conserved
among members of the SRC family (Germani et al., 2003).

CLONING

Using RT-PCR, Rouer et al. (1999) identified the full-length LCK
transcript and a splice variant lacking exon 7 in various T-cell lines
and in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) from healthy donors.

By RT-PCR of PBLs from diabetic patients and healthy controls, Nervi et
al. (2005) obtained cDNAs corresponding to full-length LCK, LCK lacking
exon 7 (LCK delta-7), and a novel LCK variant lacking exon 7 but
containing an additional 174 bp corresponding intron B between exons 2
and 3 (LCKB+7-). LCKB+7- encodes a 516-amino acid protein that, compared
with the full-length 509-amino acid protein, has a proline-rich 58-amino
acid insertion upstream of the SH3 domain and, like LCK delta-7, a
deletion of the ATP-binding site upstream of the catalytic domain. Far
Western blot analysis showed that the 58-amino acid insertion reduced
SH3 binding ability. RT-PCR analysis suggested that LCKB+7- is present
in all individuals but is sequestered in the nucleus. Nervi et al.
(2005) concluded that LCKB+7- is a rare transcript that may be present
in conditions with T-cell dysfunction.

GENE FUNCTION

Welte et al. (1999) analyzed the role of STAT (signal transducer and
activator of transcription) proteins in TCR signaling. STAT5 (601511)
became immediately and transiently phosphorylated on tyrosine-694 in
response to TCR stimulation. Expression of the protein-tyrosine kinase
LCK, a key signaling protein in the TCR complex, activated DNA binding
of transfected STAT5A and STAT5B to specific STAT-inducible elements.
The role of LCK in STAT5 activation was confirmed in a LCK-deficient
T-cell line in which the activation of STAT5 by TCR stimulation was
abolished. Inhibition of STAT5 function by expression of a
dominant-negative mutant STAT5 reduced antigen-stimulated proliferation
of T cells. Thus, TCR stimulation appears to directly activate STAT5,
which may participate in the regulation of gene transcription and T-cell
proliferation during immunologic responses.

Animals deficient in pre-TCR-alpha have few alpha-beta lineage cells but
an increased number of gamma-delta T cells. These gamma-delta T cells
exhibit more extensive TCR-beta rearrangement than gamma-delta T cells
from wildtype mice. These observations are consistent with the idea that
different signals emanating from the gamma-delta-TCR and pre-TCR
instruct lineage commitment. Using confocal microscopy and biochemistry
to analyze the initiation of signaling, Saint-Ruf et al. (2000) showed
that the pre-TCR, but not the gamma-delta TCR, colocalizes with the
p56(lck) Src kinase into glycolipid-enriched membrane domains (rafts)
apparently without any need for ligation. This results in the
phosphorylation of CD3-epsilon (186830) and ZAP70 signal transducing
molecules. Saint-Ruf et al. (2000) stated that their results indicated
clear differences between pre-TCR and gamma-delta-TCR signaling.

Type 1 diabetic (IDDM1; 222100) patients have diminished responses
following T-cell activation. By immunoblot analysis, Nervi et al. (2000)
found reduced levels of phosphorylated CD3Z (186780) in IDDM1 patients
after T-cell stimulation. Immunoblot, immunoprecipitation, and
densitometric analyses revealed significantly reduced LCK expression in
unstimulated peripheral blood cells of IDDM1 patients compared to
controls. The reduced LCK expression correlated with a lower
proliferative response. Very low LCK expression may also correlate with
the HLA-DQB1*0201/0302 (see 604305) genotype. Confocal microscopy
demonstrated normal plasma membrane expression of LCK in patients and
controls. Downstream signal transducing molecules were not affected in
these patients.

Kim et al. (2003) noted that the T-cell coreceptors CD4 and CD8 each
associate via their cytoplasmic tails with the N terminus of LCK in a
zinc-dependent manner. These interactions are required for T-cell
development and activation. By structural analysis, Kim et al. (2003)
showed that, in the absence of zinc, the coreceptor tails and the LCK N
terminus lack structure, but they assemble in the presence of zinc to
form compactly folded heterodimeric domains.

Using flow cytometry, Germani et al. (2003) deduced that the LCK delta-7
protein accounted for 15% of the total LCK protein in the Jurkat T-cell
line. Exon 7 encodes the first 51 amino acids of the LCK catalytic
domain, and deletion of this region reduced kinase activity of the
recombinant protein. However, the residual activity could be enhanced by
addition of Mn(2+). Enforced production of LCK delta-7 in transfected
Jurkat cells resulted in slower cell proliferation than did transfection
with full-length LCK. Germani et al. (2003) proposed that LCK delta-7 is
a cell signaling regulator. They noted that a case of severe combined
immunodeficiency (SCID) had been reported in which levels of full-length
LCK were low and LCK delta-7 appeared as the main LCK transcript (see
Goldman et al. (1998) and MOLECULAR GENETICS).

Using protein pull-down assays, Park et al. (2002) showed that the
N-terminal ser-rich portion of the herpesvirus Tip protein interacted
with the N terminus of the lysosomal protein WDR48 (612167). Interaction
of Tip with WDR48 induced lysosomal vesicle formation and, via the
C-terminal region of Tip, recruitment of LCK to these lysosomal vesicles
for degradation. Tip interactions with WDR48 and LCK resulted in
downregulation of TCR and CD4 surface expression, respectively, leading
to inhibition of T-lymphocyte signal transduction.

GENE STRUCTURE

Nervi et al. (2005) stated that the LCK gene contains 12 exons and spans
14 kb. Expression of LCK is controlled by 2 distinct promoters separated
by 35 kb. Alternate usage of the promoters produces 2 major classes of
mRNAs that differ only in their noncoding 5-prime ends. Alternative
splicing and the use of alternative transcription initiation sites
generates several variants in each mRNA class.

MAPPING

Marth et al. (1986) mapped the mouse Lck gene to distal chromosome 4.
Using molecular analysis by somatic cell hybridization and in situ
hybridization, they mapped the human LCK gene to chromosome 1p35-p32.
They noted that LCK closely resembles other protein-tyrosine kinase
oncogenes, notably SRC, YES (164880), and FGR (164940), and that
virus-induced murine lymphomas have been found with rearrangement of the
Lck gene, suggesting that aberrant expression of LCK may contribute to
lymphoid transformation. In man, chromosome abnormalities, deletions, or
translocations are seen in 1p34 in neuroblastomas (Gilbert et al., 1982)
and in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (Levine et al., 1985).

Volpi et al. (1994) mapped the LCK gene to 1p35-p34.3 by fluorescence in
situ hybridization. By dual-color in situ hybridization with an LCK
probe and a probe for D1S57, which was mapped to 1p34.3-p34.2 by Van Roy
et al. (1993), they found that the LCK gene was telomeric to the
anonymous marker.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Goldman et al. (1998) noted that the T-cell antigen receptor plays a
crucial role in thymocyte differentiation and T-cell activation. After
antigen binding to the TCR, and in concert with engagement of other
coreceptors and their associated ligands (such as CD4 and major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, CD28 (186760), B7 (112203),
CD8, and MHC I), signal transduction cascades are activated. The
earliest measurable biochemical event is the activation of
protein-tyrosine kinases, resulting in the phosphorylation of multiple
cellular substrates. At least 3 protein-tyrosine kinases are known to be
involved in TCR signaling at the level of the receptor, including
p59(fyn) (FYN; 137025), p56(lck), and ZAP70 (176947). Individuals with
mutations in the gene coding for the ZAP70 protein show severe combined
immunodeficiency (SCID), a heterogeneous disorder characterized by
profound defects in cellular and humoral immunity, due to selective
T-cell defect, e.g., 176947.0001. Patients present with an absence of
peripheral CD8(+) T cells and normal to high levels of peripheral CD4(+)
T cells which are unable to signal through the TCR. SCID-like phenotypes
have also been observed in mice rendered p56(lck) or p59(fyn) deficient
by homologous recombination. Mice lacking p56(lck) as well as transgenic
mice expressing dominant-negative mutations of p56(lck) demonstrate
severe T-cell developmental defects (Molina et al., 1992; Levin et al.,
1993).

Goldman et al. (1998) described an infant with clinical and laboratory
features of SCID and selective CD4 lymphopenia and lack of CD28
expression on CD8(+) T cells. T cells from this patient showed poor
blastogenic responses to various mitogens and to interleukin-2 (IL2;
147680). Other T-cell antigen receptor-induced responses, including
upregulation of CD69 (107273), were similarly inhibited. However, more
proximal T-cell antigen receptor signaling events, such as anti-CD3
induced protein-tyrosine phosphorylation, phosphorylation of
mitogen-associated protein kinase, and calcium mobilization, were
intact. Although p59(fyn) and ZAP70 protein-tyrosine kinases were
expressed at normal levels, a marked decrease in the level of p56(lck)
was noted. Furthermore, this decrease was associated with the presence
of an alternatively spliced LCK transcript lacking the exon 7
kinase-encoding domain. These data suggested that deficiency in p56(lck)
expression can produce a SCID phenotype in humans. The patient was a
male infant from a nonconsanguineous union who was noted to have loose
stools and poor weight gain at 1 month of age. He was first hospitalized
at 2 months of age for dehydration, failure to thrive, and sepsis. Oral
candidiasis and weight below the fifth percentile were found at that
time. Rotavirus was isolated from the stool, Enterobacter cloacae from
the blood, and cytomegalovirus from the urine and intestinal biopsies.
Lymphopenia and hypogammaglobulinemia were noted. Tests for HIV and for
other causes of SCID, including deficiencies of adenosine deaminase and
purine nucleoside phosphorylase, excluded those diagnoses. A 2-month
trial of IL2, begun when the patient was 26 months old, elicited neither
a clinical response nor an improvement in lymphocyte numbers (total
lymphocyte count ranged between 780 and 1,890). At the age of 32 months,
the patient underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant from a
matched unrelated donor. All sequences normally found in exon 7 were
absent in the patient. To test whether the skipping of exon 7 was due to
splice site mutations, intron 6, exon 7, and intron 7 were PCR amplified
from patient and control genomic DNA and then sequenced. No differences
were observed in the splice sequences flanking exon 7 or within 20 bp on
either side. The RT-PCR products generated from the patient's cDNA using
forward and reverse primers within the 5-prime and 3-prime ends of the
molecule yielded 2 bands of approximately equal intensity, whereas 1
band was barely detectable or absent when cDNA from control peripheral
blood mononuclear cells, the parents, or Jurkat cDNA was used. While the
precise genetic defect responsible for the decreased expression p56(lck)
in this patient was not fully understood, Goldman et al. (1998) thought
it likely that aberrant alternative splicing of exon 7 was responsible.

CYTOGENETICS

In a patient with T-lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and a translocation
t(1;7)(p34;q34) as the sole karyotypic abnormality, Tycko et al. (1991)
found evidence of joining of the LCK gene with the gene encoding the
T-cell antigen receptor beta subunit (TCRB; see 186930). The chromosomal
breakpoint was located 2 kb upstream of the LCK upstream promoter and
first nontranslated exon. In a second t(1;7) translocation, the
breakpoint was found between 2 alternative LCK promoters, upstream of
the second exon. Relative to normal thymus and activated T cells, levels
of LCK mRNA were greatly elevated in the first case and moderately
elevated in the second. Burnett et al. (1991) also studied involvement
of the LCK gene in a t(1;7) leukemia translocation.

Burnett et al. (1994) provided a molecular analysis of the
t(1;7)(p34;q34) in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia that fuses LCK
and TCRB.

ANIMAL MODEL

During T-cell development, assembly and expression of a complete gene
for the beta chain of the T-cell receptor blocks further rearrangement
at the TCRB locus (a process referred to as allelic exclusion) and
drives the generation and expansion of cells positive for CD4 and CD8.
Studies in transgenic animals suggested that the lymphocyte-specific
protein-tyrosine kinase p56(lck) may impinge on the same pathway used by
TCR-beta chains to deliver such signals. This hypothesis predicts that
interference with p56(lck) function would mitigate the effects of a
simultaneously expressed TCR-beta chain. Anderson et al. (1993)
confirmed this prediction through examination of allelic exclusion in
mice expressing both a functional TCRB transgene and a catalytically
inactive form of p56(lck). Thus, the oncogene LCK is the
protein-tyrosine kinase that regulates allelic exclusion at the T-cell
receptor beta locus.

By creating a lck-knockout mouse with a doxycycline-inducible lck
transgene, Seddon et al. (2000) assessed the role of LCK in T cell
development and population of the peripheral T cell pool. Knockout mice
fed doxycycline (dox) had functional T cell phenotypes similar to those
of wildtype control mice, whereas the phenotype of knockout mice that
had dox removed from their diets (Lck1 OFF) resembled that of
Lck-negative mice. Analysis of thymic cellularity revealed a rapid
atrophy in the Lck1 OFF mice due to loss of double-positive (CD4+/CD8+)
cells. Although expression of lck is essential for full activation of
naive T cells, flow cytometric and immunoblot analyses showed that
continued expression of lck is not required for their prolonged
survival. Adoptive transfer experiments showed that homeostatic
proliferation of naive T cells does require sustained lck expression.
Therefore, the signals that mediate survival and homeostasis appear to
be distinct.

By flow cytometric analysis of mice expressing an inducible Lck
transgene in T cells, Tewari et al. (2006) found that immunologically
naive mice lacking Lck were unable to activate or expand viral
antigen-specific Cd8-positive T cells. The magnitude of primary
Cd8-positive T-cell expansion depended on the duration of Lck-dependent
signaling. Memory Cd8-positive T cells, however, did not require Lck for
functional avidity, maintenance, or reactivation. Tewari et al. (2006)
concluded that naive, but not memory, CD8-positive T cells require LCK
for activation, possibly accounting for the hyperreactivity to antigen
of memory cells and accelerated immune control during secondary
infections.

607860	TITLE *607860 YY1 ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1; YY1AP1
;;YY1-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; YAP;;
HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 2; HCCA2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By differential display PCR of normal hepatic tissue and hepatocellular
carcinomas, followed by screening a placenta cDNA library, Wang et al.
(2001) cloned YY1AP1, which they called HCCA2. The deduced 467-amino
acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 50.65 kD. HCCA2 contains
2 SH3-binding domains, 2 N-glycosylation sites, 6 N-myristoylation
sites, and numerous phosphorylation sites, but it does not have a
transmembrane domain, signal peptide, or targeting sequences. Northern
blot analysis detected 1.8- and 2.5-kb transcripts in all adult tissues
examined except liver. Expression was also detected in fetal liver,
lung, brain, and spleen. Western blot analysis of transfected embryonic
kidney fibroblasts detected HCCA2 at an apparent molecular mass of about
50 kD. Immunohistochemical staining showed that HCCA2 protein was
localized in the cytoplasm of liver cancer tissues, and it was not found
in surrounding nontumor hepatocytes.

Kuryshev et al. (2006) determined that YY1AP1 was formed by fusion of
the 5-prime region of the ASH1L gene (607999) and the 3-prime region of
the GON4L gene (610393) during a tandem segmental duplication on
chromosome 1. YY1AP1 contains the partial promoter and untranslated
first exon of ASH1L and coding exons 13 to 21 of GON4L. The 3-prime
region of YY1AP1 originated from a long terminal repeat of an endogenous
retrovirus, known as the MER51A repeat, that was inserted into exon 21
of GON4L after the duplication. The deduced YY1AP1 protein contains 750
amino acids, 748 of which correspond to amino acids 590 to 1,337 of the
GON4L protein. The last 2 C-terminal residues of YY1AP1 come from the
long terminal repeat of MER51A. RT-PCR detected ubiquitous expression of
YY1AP1, with highest levels in testis and skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Wang et al. (2001) determined that HCCA2 was not expressed in normal
adult liver tissue, but it was expressed in 79% of hepatocellular
carcinomas tested. HCCA2 expression was associated with invasion of the
tumor capsule.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Kuryshev et al. (2006) mapped the YY1AP1
gene to chromosome 1q22.

604665	TITLE *604665 COP9, SUBUNIT 3; COPS3
;;SGN3
DESCRIPTION To identify new components of the 26S proteasome, Seeger et al. (1998)
obtained peptide sequences from a 45-kD protein. By micropeptide
sequence analysis and probing of cDNA libraries, Seeger et al. (1998)
isolated a cDNA encoding COPS3, which they termed SGN3, for subunit 3 of
a novel 450-kD signalosome complex that also includes TRIP15 (604508),
COPS5 (604850), GPS1 (601934), and 4 other subunits. Sequence analysis
predicted that COPS3 is a 403-amino acid protein which contains regions
with homology to the 26S proteasome S3 regulatory subunit.
Autoradiographic analysis showed that the complex phosphorylates JUN
(165160), IKBA (164008), and the C-terminal part of the p105 precursor
of NFKB (164011). The 26S proteasome is not a phosphorylation target,
although immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that the 450-kD
complex has a cytosolic localization, concentrated around the nucleus.

Elsea et al. (1999) reported the localization and partial
characterization of SGN3. They mapped the SGN3 gene to 17p11.2 by
somatic cell hybrid analysis. By analysis of genomic clones, they
further localized the SGN3 gene to the distal end of the Smith-Magenis
syndrome (SMS) critical region (182290), near marker D17S71. Although
SMS patients were haploinsufficient for SGN3, analyses showed that the
SGN3 protein was present at equivalent levels in patient and parental
control cells, and that the COP9 signalosome complex was assembled and
in normal quantities in transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines from
patients. Elsea et al. (1999) concluded that SGN3 probably does not play
a significant role with respect to SMS, although its involvement could
not be ruled out since the importance of the COP9 signalosome in
embryogenesis or differentiation was not well understood.

;;ALDEHYDE DEHYDROGENASE 8; ALDH8;;
ACETALDEHYDE DEHYDROGENASE 8
DESCRIPTION See ALDH1 (100640). Hsu et al. (1995) and Hsu and Chang (1996) reported
the cloning, sequencing and expression of the human ALDH8 gene. Hsu et
al. (1997) determined the structure of the ALDH7 (600466) and ALDH8
genes. The ALDH7 gene spans about 20 kb of genomic DNA and contains 9
coding exons. The ALDH8 gene is over 10 kb long and contains at least 10
exons. The ALDH8 gene contains an in-frame stop codon at the seventeenth
codon position from the first initiator methionine. The coding region of
the ALDH7 gene shows about 86% nucleotide identity with the
corresponding region of the ALDH8 gene. The numbers and positions of the
introns of the 2 genes are conserved, suggesting that gene duplication
is involved in the expansion of the ALDH gene family. The human ALDH7
and ALDH8 genes have a close evolutionary relationship with human ALDH3
(100660).

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the ALDH8
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP U37519).

CDCREL1
PNUTL1/MLL FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Zieger et al. (1997) identified the human SEPT5 gene, which they called
CDCREL, during the course of studying the expression of the GP1BB gene
(138720). The 206-amino acid precursor of GP Ib-beta is synthesized from
a 1.0-kb mRNA expressed by megakaryocytes. Zieger et al. (1997)
performed cDNA cloning experiments to identify the origin of a 3.5-kb
transcript that was synthesized, in addition to the 1.0-kb transcript,
by a cell line that exhibits megakaryocyte-like properties. These
experiments demonstrated that the longer transcript results from a
nonconsensus polyadenylation recognition sequence,
5-prime-AACAAT-3-prime, within a separate gene located upstream of the
platelet GP1BB gene. In the absence of normal polyadenylation, the more
5-prime gene uses the polyadenylation site within its 3-prime neighbor,
the platelet GP1BB gene. The 5-prime CDCREL gene was found to contain an
open reading frame encoding 369 amino acids with a high degree of
sequence similarity to an expanding family of GTP-binding proteins.

McKie et al. (1997) identified an expressed sequence tag (EST) related
to Drosophila 'peanut' and isolated the corresponding cDNA. The
predicted 369-amino acid protein has P-loop nucleotide-binding and
GTPase motifs. Northern blot analysis detected major 2.2- and minor
3.5-kb transcripts in both heart and brain. McKie et al. (1997) found
that PNUTL1 and the GP1BB gene are encoded on the same DNA strand,
overlapping with the same transcriptional orientation. McKie et al.
(1997) stated that PNUTL1 is a member of the septin gene family, which
encodes proteins with GTPase activity thought to interact during
cytokinesis.

Yagi et al. (1998) identified cDNAs representing 2 HCDCREL1 transcripts
that differ in their 5-prime ends, and they stated that these
transcripts appear to arise by alternative splicing, possibly
accompanied by alternative promoter use. RNase protection and primer
extension analyses identified multiple 5-prime ends for HCDCREL1 mRNAs,
suggesting that HCDCREL1 is transcribed from alternative promoters.
Northern blot analysis showed abundant levels of a 2.3-kb transcript,
consisting of only HCDCREL1 sequence, and a 3.5-kb transcript,
consisting of both HCDCREL1 and GP1BB sequences, in brain and platelets;
these transcripts were not detected in liver or placenta.

By screening a fetal brain cDNA expression library for proteins
recognized by antibody directed against synaptophysin (313475),
Caltagarone et al. (1998) cloned CDCREL. Western blot analysis detected
brain CDCREL at an apparent molecular mass of 42 kD. Immunoblot analysis
revealed CDCREL in extracts of all specific brain regions examined.
Protein levels were higher in cortical regions and in globis pallidus
and lower in other subcortical brain regions. Differential
centrifugation revealed CDCREL associated predominantly with membrane
components, where it cofractionated with SNAP25 (600322)-labeled
membranes. Immunocytochemical analysis of the hippocampus showed CDCREL
within cell bodies and dendritic processes of pyramidal cells and in a
punctate staining pattern around dendrites in the molecular layers;
staining was excluded from neuronal nuclei. In the midfrontal and visual
cortex, CDCREL was located diffusely throughout the neuropil and in
punctate structures, reminiscent of synaptic junctions.

Zieger et al. (2000) found abundant PNUTL1 mRNA transcript in a myeloid
leukemia cell line and in adult human brain and heart, with detectable
levels of expression in all other organs except liver. By Western blot
analysis, they found the protein expressed in brain to have an apparent
molecular mass of 45 kD.

Peng et al. (2002) found that Cdcrel1 expression increased at the time
of synaptic maturation during mouse development. Immunoprecipitation of
mouse brain homogenates detected Cdcrel1 in a complex that included the
septins Nedd5 (601506) and Cdc10 (603151).

GENE FUNCTION

By immunogold labeling, Dent et al. (2002) found that CDCREL1 associated
with alpha granules of human blood platelets. Stimulation of platelets
with thrombin (176930), phorbol esters, and collagen (see 120150)
resulted in the phosphorylation of CDCREL1.

Using several protein interaction assays, Blaser et al. (2002) found
that CDCREL1, which they called SEPT5, interacted with SEPT8 (608418) in
cells expressing both proteins. They also observed a strong correlation
between the presence of CDCREL1 and SEPT8 transcripts and proteins in
brain, heart, and platelets.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yagi et al. (1998) reported that the SEPT5 gene contains 13 exons
spanning over 8.8 kb.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Zieger et al. (1997) identified the SEPT5 upstream
of the GP1BB gene on chromosome 22q11.2. McKie et al. (1997) mapped the
mouse Sept5 gene to chromosome 16.

CYTOGENETICS

Megonigal et al. (1998) examined the MLL (159555) genomic translocation
breakpoint in acute myeloid leukemia of infant twins. Southern blot
analysis showed 2 identical MLL gene rearrangements indicating
chromosomal translocation. The rearrangements were detected in the
second twin before signs of clinical disease and the intensity relative
to the normal fragment indicated that the translocation was not
constitutional. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with an MLL-specific
probe and karyotype analyses suggested that a t(11;22)(q23;q11.2)
disrupted MLL. Known 5-prime sequence from MLL but unknown 3-prime
sequence from 22q11.2 formed the breakpoint junction on the derivative
chromosome 11, der(11). Megonigal et al. (1998) used panhandle variant
PCR to clone the translocation breakpoint and identified a region of
22q11.2 involved in both leukemia and a constitutional disorder. By
ligating a single-stranded oligonucleotide that was homologous to known
5-prime MLL genomic sequence to the 5-prime ends of BamHI-digested DNA
through a bridging oligonucleotide, they formed the stem-loop template
for panhandle variant PCR, which yielded products of 3.9 kb. The MLL
genomic breakpoint was in intron 7. The sequence of the partner DNA from
22q11.2 was identical to the human CDCrel (cell division cycle-related)
gene that maps to the region commonly deleted in DiGeorge (188400) and
velocardiofacial (192430) syndromes. Both MLL and CDCrel contained
homologous CT, TTTGTG, and GAA sequences within a few basepairs of their
respective breakpoints, which may have been important in uniting these 2
genes by translocation. RT-PCR amplified an in-frame fusion of MLL exon
7 to CDCrel exon 3, indicating that a chimeric mRNA had been
transcribed.

ANIMAL MODEL

Peng et al. (2002) found that Cdcrel1-null mice appeared normal,
achieved normal adult weights, and were fertile. The brains of mutant
mice showed normal thickness and gross morphology of cortical layers and
normal synaptic properties. While the expression of a number of synaptic
proteins was unaffected in Cdcrel1 mutant mice, the expression of other
septins was altered. The authors concluded that Cdcrel1 is not essential
for neuronal development or function and that other septins may provide
functional redundancy.

Dent et al. (2002) observed that Cdcrel-null mice showed no changes in
platelet size or ultrastructure.

By virus-mediated gene transfer, Dong et al. (2003) expressed the human
CDCREL gene in the substantia nigra of rats. Overexpression of CDCREL
caused progressive loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons and a decline in
striatal dopamine levels. CDCREL inhibited release of dopamine from
stably-transfected rat neuronal precursor cells, and pharmacologic
inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine synthesis in rats
prevented CDCREL-induced nigral neurodegeneration. Dong et al. (2003)
concluded that CDCREL overexpression exerts dopamine-dependent
neurotoxicity.

Previous studies have identified a 200-kb region of chromosome 22q11.2,
which contains the Sept5 gene, that contributes to behavioral phenotypes
in mice. Suzuki et al. (2009) reported that Sept5-knockout mice showed
decreased affiliative active social interaction that was influenced by
genetic backgrounds. In contrast, Sept5 deficiency decreased
anxiety-related behavior, increased prepulse inhibition, and delayed
acquisition of rewarded goal approach, independent of genetic
background. Suzuki et al. (2009) suggested that Sept5 deficiency exerts
pleiotropic effects on a select set of affective behaviors and cognitive
processes, and that genetic backgrounds could provide an epistatic
influence on phenotypic expression.

300027	TITLE *300027 RNA-BINDING MOTIF PROTEIN 3; RBM3
DESCRIPTION Using cDNA selection with a YAC from the Xp11.2 region, Derry et al.
(1995) identified a novel gene, which they designated RBM3 (for
'RNA-binding motif protein 3'), that encodes a polypeptide with high
sequence similarity to a group of proteins that bind to RNA; see also
the Y-chromosome genes RBM1 (400006) and RBM2. On a YAC contig map, RBM3
was found to be located between OATL1 (311240) and GATA1 (305371)/TFE3
(314310) in subband Xp11.23. The gene gave rise to alternatively spliced
transcripts in a variety of human tissues. The longest open reading
frame encodes a 157-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular weight
of 17 kD. Its putative RNA-binding domain most closely resembles that of
2 previously characterized human RNA-binding proteins, YRRM, the gene
which has been implicated in azoospermia (415000), and a glycoprotein
identified as an autoantigen. The authors noted that homology of RBM3 in
both sequence and size to an RNA-binding protein from maize, AAIP,
suggested it functions in a fundamental pathway conserved from plants to
mammals.

604191	TITLE *604191 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 263; ZNF263
DESCRIPTION Zinc finger proteins (ZNFs), which bind nucleic acids, perform many key
functions, the most important of which is regulating transcription. See
ZNF91 (603971) for general information on ZNFs.

By sequencing cDNAs randomly selected from a cDNA library generated from
granulocytoid cells that were derived from the human promyelocytic
leukemia cell line 60 (HL60), Okubo et al. (1995) identified partial
cDNAs representing several novel genes. Using 1 of these cDNAs, Yokoyama
et al. (1997) isolated a full-length cDNA encoding ZNF263, which they
named FPM315. The deduced 683-amino acid protein contains 9 C-terminal
C2H2-type zinc finger domains, some of which are connected by H/C links;
a KRAB A box, which has been shown in other ZNFs to act as a
transcriptional repressor domain; and an N-terminal leucine-rich region
(LeR) that is also rich in glutamic acids, is highly conserved in a
subset of ZNFs, and is predicted to contain 2 alpha helices. Northern
blot analysis detected 2 major transcripts of approximately 3.4 and 3.8
kb. ZNF263 was expressed in all human fetal and adult tissues examined.

612914	TITLE *612914 MEDIATOR COMPLEX SUBUNIT 29; MED29
;;INTERSEX, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF;;
INTERSEX-LIKE; IXL
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MED29 is a subunit of the Mediator complex, a multiprotein coactivator
of RNA transcription that interacts with DNA-bound transcriptional
activators, RNA polymerase II (see 180660), and general initiation
factors (Sato et al., 2003).

CLONING

By sequencing peptide fragments from a protein that copurified with the
HeLa cell Mediator complex, followed by database analysis, Sato et al.
(2003) identified MED29, which they called Intersex.

By searching a human EST database for sequences similar to Drosophila
Intersex, followed by PCR of a fetal heart cDNA library and 5-prime and
3-prime RACE, Wang et al. (2004) cloned MED29, which they called IXL.
The deduced 221-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of
23.5 kD. It contains a PxxP motif for binding SRC (190090) homology-3
(SH3) domains. IXL is highly conserved across a wide range of species,
and it shares 92% amino acid identity with mouse Ixl and 36% identity
with Drosophila Intersex. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.6-kb
transcript expressed at variable levels in all adult and fetal human
tissues examined. Fluorescence-tagged IXL localized predominantly to the
nucleus, but also to the cytoplasm, of transfected COS-7 cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using coimmunoprecipitation analysis and protein pull-down assays, Sato
et al. (2003) confirmed that MED29 is a Mediator subunit. Coexpression
of epitope-tagged proteins revealed that MED29 interacted most strongly
with the Mediator subunit TRFP (MED20; 612915), and TRFP appeared the
bridge an interaction between MED29 and p28b (MED18; 612384).

Wang et al. (2004) showed that IXL suppressed transcription of a
reporter gene upon cotransfection in COS-7 cells. IXL specifically
suppressed the transcriptional activities of the FOS (164810) serum
response element (SRE) and AP1 (see 165160), suggesting that IXL is a
transcriptional suppressor within MAP kinase (see MAPK1; 176948)
signaling pathways.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wang et al. (2004) determined that the MED29 gene contains 4 exons and
spans about 9.3 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Wang et al. (2004) mapped the MED29 gene
to chromosome 19q13.2.

609205	TITLE *609205 DAB2-INTERACTING PROTEIN; DAB2IP
;;ASK1-INTERACTING PROTEIN; AIP1;;
KIAA1743
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DAB2IP is a Ras (190020) GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that acts as a
tumor suppressor. The DAB2IP gene is inactivated by methylation in
prostate and breast cancers (Yano et al., 2005).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated hippocampus cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned a partial DAB2IP cDNA, which they
designated KIAA1743. The deduced protein shares significant sequence
identity with nGAP (RASAL2; 606136). RT-PCR ELISA detected intermediate
to high expression in all adult and fetal tissues examined. Highest
expression was detected in adult brain, adult kidney, and fetal brain.
Within specific adult brain regions, highest expression was detected in
cerebellum, hippocampus, caudate nucleus, substantia nigra, and
subthalamic nucleus.

Using the rat Dab2ip homolog, Dip1/2, to design primers, Chen et al.
(2002) cloned human DAB2IP by PCR of a prostate epithelia cell line. The
deduced 967-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 110
kD. The N-terminal half of DAB2IP contains a protein kinase C (see
176960) conserved region-2 (C2) domain and a RasGAP domain. The
C-terminal half contains a proline-rich region and a leucine zipper
domain. PCR detected a single transcript in brain and 3 transcripts in
normal prostate cell lines. Chen et al. (2002) determined that the
variant transcripts result from the use of alternate first exons and
alternate transcription start sites.

Using the C-terminal domain of ASK1 (MAP3K5; 602448) as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen of a heart cDNA library, followed by PCR of an umbilical
vein endothelial cell cDNA library, Zhang et al. (2003) cloned DAB2IP,
which they designated AIP1. The deduced protein contains 1,065 amino
acids. Zhang et al. (2003) identified a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain
N-terminal to the C2 domain described by Chen et al. (2002).

GENE STRUCTURE

Chen et al. (2002) determined that the DAB2IP gene spans 96 kb and
contains 15 exons. In addition, they identified an alternative first
exon, which they designated exon 1b. Intron 1 spans about 56 kb, and the
translation initiation codon is within exon 3. Chen et al. (2002)
identified 2 potential promoters, P1, which is located within the first
intron, and P2, which is located 5-prime of exon 1a. Both lack canonical
TATA and CAAT boxes. The P2 region upstream of exon 1a is rich in CpG
and contains several Sp1 (189906)-binding sites. Binding sites for AP1
(165160), AP2 (107580), and other transcription factors are also present
within the promoter region.

GENE FUNCTION

Wang et al. (2002) found that rat Dab2ip interacted with the N-terminal
domain of Dab2 (601236). Dab2ip stimulated the GTPase activity of Ras in
vitro and in vivo. Increased expression of Dab2ip caused a
dose-dependent inhibition of basal transcription from a serum response
element in human prostate cancer cells. Dab2ip inhibited the growth of
prostate cancer cells, and the inhibition required the interaction
between Dab2ip and Dab2.

Using coimmunoprecipitation assays and mutation analysis, Zhang et al.
(2003) showed that a lysine-rich cluster within the C2 domain of DAB2IP
interacted with the C-terminal domain of ASK1. In contrast to the ASK1
inhibitor 14-3-3 (see 609009), DAB2IP preferentially bound
dephosphorylated ASK1. In quiescent endothelial cells, DAB2IP did not
bind ASK1, but existed in a closed form through an intramolecular
interaction between its N and C termini. DAB2IP was required for TNFA
(TNF; 191160)-induced ASK1 activation, which involved DAB2IP unfolding,
association of DAB2IP with ASK1, and facilitated release of 14-3-3 from
ASK1, resulting in downstream activation of JNK (see MAPK8; 601158).
TNFA activation of ASK1 required the ASK1-binding and GAP activities of
DAB2IP. Knockdown of DAB2IP by RNA interference blunted TNFA-induced
ASK1/JNK activation. Zhang et al. (2003) concluded that DAB2IP mediates
TNFA-induced ASK1 activation by facilitating dissociation of 14-3-3 from
ASK1.

Zhang et al. (2004) found that DAB2IP localized on the plasma membrane
in resting human and bovine endothelial cells in a complex with TNFR1
(TNFRSF1A; 191190). TNF binding induced release of DAB2IP from TNFR1,
resulting in cytoplasmic translocation and concomitant formation of an
intracellular signaling complex containing TRADD (603500), RIP1 (RIPK1;
603453), TRAF2 (601895), and DAB2IP. Mutation analysis indicated that
the C-terminal proline-rich domain of DAB2IP was critical in maintaining
the interaction between DAB2IP and TNFR1. A PERIOD (602260)-like domain
of DAB2IP interacted with the RING finger domain of TRAF2 and enhanced
TRAF2-induced ASK1 activation. At the same time, binding of DAB2IP to
TRAF2 inhibited TNF-induced IKK (see 600664)-NFKB (see 164011)
signaling.

- Role in Cancer

Chen et al. (2002) found that expression of DAB2IP was lower in prostate
cancer cell lines than in normal prostate epithelial cell lines. They
showed that the P1 promoter of DAB2IP was active in normal cells, but
inactive in the cancer cell lines.

Chen et al. (2003) found that acetylhistone H3 (see 602810) was
associated with the DAB2IP promoter region, and CpG islands remained
almost unmethylated, in normal prostate epithelium, but not in prostate
cancer cell lines. A histone deacetylase inhibitor and a DNA
hypomethylation agent acted cooperatively to reactivate DAB2IP gene
expression in the cancer cells. Histone acetylation played a more
significant role in gene activation, and the P2 promoter was more
important than P1 in regulating DAB2IP expression in prostate epithelial
cells.

Yano et al. (2005) reported that aberrant methylation in 2 separate
regions of the P2 promoter of DAB2IP was associated with lung cancers.
Aberrant methylation was also associated with advanced disease stage.

Chen et al. (2005) showed that increased EZH2 (601573) expression in
normal human prostate epithelial cells suppressed DAB2IP gene
expression. In contrast, knockdown of endogenous EZH2 levels in prostate
cancer cells via small interfering RNA increased DAB2IP expression. In
prostate cancer, but not normal prostate epithelial cells, an EZH2
complex that included EED (605984) and SUZ12 (606245) associated with
the DAB2IP promoter and increased promoter occupancy by lys27-methylated
histone H3 and HDAC1 (601241). Knockdown of EZH2 reduced the association
of methylated histone H3 and HDAC1 with the DAB2IP promoter. Chen et al.
(2005) concluded that DAB2IP is a target for EZH2-mediated gene
silencing in prostate epithelium.

Using predominantly a mouse tumor model and genetic manipulation of
human prostate cancer cells, Min et al. (2010) showed that direct
EZH2-mediated downregulation of DAB2IP induced an
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in the cancer cells and
increased their metastatic potential. DAB2IP downregulation activated
RAS and NFKB. RAS activation drove cell growth, while NFKB activation
triggered EMT and metastasis. Min et al. (2010) found an inverse
relationship between EZH2 and DAB2IP expression in human prostate cancer
tissues and an inverse relationship between DAB2IP expression and tumor
grade. Min et al. (2010) concluded that epigenetic suppression of DAB2IP
by EZH2 is a major mechanism of DAB2IP inactivation in human prostate
cancer and increases metastatic potential.

;;APLYSIA RAS-RELATED HOMOLOG 12; ARH12;;
ARHA;;
ONCOGENE RHO H12; RHOH12; RHO12
DESCRIPTION The human ARH genes (sometimes called 'Rho' genes) share several
properties with the RAS gene family (see 190020).

MAPPING

Cannizzaro et al. (1990) mapped 1 member of the ARH family, the H12
(RHOA) gene, to chromosome 3p21 by in situ hybridization. Kiss et al.
(1997) assigned the RHOA gene to chromosome 3p21.3 by fluorescence in
situ hybridization and by PCR study of somatic cell hybrids.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Maesaki et al. (1999) reported the 2.2-angstrom crystal structure of
RhoA bound to an effector domain of protein kinase PRKCL1 (601302). The
structure revealed the antiparallel coiled-coil finger (ACC finger) fold
of the effector domain that binds to the Rho specificity-determining
regions containing switch I, beta strands B2 and B3, and the C-terminal
alpha helix A5, predominantly by specific hydrogen bonds. The ACC finger
fold is distinct from those for other small G proteins and provides
evidence for the diverse ways of effector recognition. Sequence analysis
based on the structure suggested that the ACC finger fold is widespread
in Rho effector proteins.

Lutz et al. (2007) determined the crystal structure of the G-alpha-q
(600998)-p63RhoGEF (610215)-RhoA complex, detailing the interactions of
G-alpha-q with the Dbl and pleckstrin homology (DH and PH) domains of
p63RhoGEF. These interactions involved the effector-binding site and the
C-terminal region of G-alpha-q and appeared to relieve autoinhibition of
the catalytic DH domain by the PH domain. Trio (601893), Duet (604605),
and p63RhoGEF were shown to constitute a family of G-alpha-q effectors
that appear to activate RhoA both in vitro and in intact cells. Lutz et
al. (2007) proposed that this structure represents the crux of an
ancient signal transduction pathway that is expected to be important in
an array of physiologic processes.

GENE FUNCTION

The small guanosine triphosphatase (GTP) Rho regulates remodeling of the
actin cytoskeleton during cell morphogenesis and motility. In their
Figure 3C, Maekawa et al. (1999) diagrammed proposed signaling pathways
for Rho-induced remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. They demonstrated
that active Rho signals to its downstream effector ROCK1 (601702), which
phosphorylates and activates LIM kinase (see 601329). LIM kinase, in
turn, phosphorylates cofilin (601442), inhibiting its
actin-depolymerizing activity.

Nakamura et al. (2001) studied the role of Rho in the migration of
corneal epithelial cells in rabbit. They detected both ROCK1 and ROCK2
(604002) in the corneal epithelium at protein and mRNA levels. They
found that exoenzyme C3, a Rho inhibitor, inhibits corneal epithelial
migration in a dose-dependent manner and prevents the stimulatory effect
of the Rho activator lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). Both cytochalasin B,
an inhibitor of actin filament assembly, and ML7, an inhibitor of myosin
light chain kinase, also prevent LPA stimulation of epithelial
migration. The authors suggested that Rho mediates corneal epithelial
migration in response to external stimuli by regulating the organization
of the actin cytoskeleton.

Rao et al. (2001) investigated the role of Rho kinase in the modulation
of aqueous humor outflow facility. The treatment of human trabecular
meshwork and canal of Schlemm cells with a Rho kinase-specific inhibitor
led to significant but reversible changes in cell shape and decreased
actin stress fibers, focal adhesions, and protein phosphotyrosine
staining. Based on the Rho kinase inhibitor-induced changes in myosin
light chain phosphorylation and actomyosin organization, the authors
suggested that cellular relaxation and loss of cell-substratum adhesions
in the human trabecular meshwork and canal of Schlemm cells could result
in either increased paracellular fluid flow across the canal of Schlemm
or altered flow pathway through the juxtacanalicular tissue, thereby
lowering resistance to outflow. They suggested Rho kinase as a potential
target for the development of drugs to modulate intraocular pressure in
glaucoma patients.

Sin et al. (2002) used in vivo time-lapse imaging of optic tectal cells
in Xenopus laevis tadpoles to demonstrate that enhanced visual activity
driven by a light stimulus promotes dendritic arbor growth. The
stimulus-induced dendritic arbor growth requires glutamate receptor (see
138249)-mediated synaptic transmission, decreased RhoA activity, and
increased RAC (see 602048) and CDC42 (116952) activity. Sin et al.
(2002) concluded that their results delineated a role for Rho GTPases in
the structural plasticity driven by visual stimulation in vivo.

Zhou et al. (2003) found that Rho and its effector Rock1 preferentially
regulated the amount of A-beta(42), a highly amyloidogenic, 42-residue
amyloid beta (104760) peptide, produced in vitro and that only those
NSAIDs (nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs) effective as Rho inhibitors
lowered A-beta(42). Administration of a selective Rock inhibitor also
preferentially lowered brain levels of A-beta(42) in a transgenic mouse
model of Alzheimer disease (104300). Thus, Zhou et al. (2003) concluded
that the Rho-Rock pathway may regulate amyloid precursor protein
processing, and a subset of NSAIDs can reduce A-beta(42) through
inhibition of Rho activity.

Wang et al. (2003) found that atypical protein kinase C-zeta (PKC2;
176982), an effector of the Cdc42/Rac1-PAR6 (607484) polarity complex,
recruited Smurf1 (605568) to cellular protrusions, where it controlled
the local level of RhoA. Smurf1 thus links the polarity complex to
degradation of RhoA in lamellipodia and filopodia to prevent RhoA
signaling during dynamic membrane movements.

Using mouse brain endothelial cells, Crose et al. (2009) showed that
Ccm2 (607929) interacted with the RhoA ubiquitin ligase Smurf1. Ccm2
directed Smurf1 to the cell periphery, which led to local degradation of
RhoA. Knockdown of Ccm2 resulted in RhoA stability and cytoskeletal
changes leading to monolayer permeability, decreased tubule formation,
and reduced cell migration. Crose et al. (2009) concluded that CCM2
contributes to endothelial cell integrity by regulating SMURF1-directed
RHOA degradation.

Borikova et al. (2010) showed that knockdown of Ccm1 (KRIT1; 604214),
Ccm2, or Ccm3 (603285) in mouse embryonic endothelial cells induced RhoA
overexpression and persistent RhoA activity at the cell edge, as well as
in the cytoplasm and nucleus. RhoA activation was especially pronounced
following Ccm1 knockdown. Knockdown of Ccm1, Ccm2, or Ccm3 inhibited
formation of vessel-like tubes and invasion of extracellular matrix.
Knockdown or inhibition of Rock2 countered these effects and was
associated with inhibition of RhoA-stimulated phosphorylation of myosin
light chain-2 (MLC2; see 160781). Borikova et al. (2010) concluded that
the protein complex made up of CCM1, CCM2, and CCM3 regulates RhoA
activation and cytoskeletal dynamics.

In human coronary artery vascular smooth muscle cells, UPA (PLAU;
191840) stimulates cell migration via a UPA receptor (UPAR, or PLAUR;
173391) signaling complex containing TYK2 (176941) and
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K; see 601232). Kiian et al. (2003)
showed that association of TYK2 and PI3K with active GTP-bound forms of
both RHOA and RAC1, but not CDC42, as well as phosphorylation of myosin
light chain (see 160781), are downstream events required for
UPA/UPAR-directed migration.

Wu et al. (2005) showed that transcripts for RhoA, a small GTPase that
regulates the actin cytoskeleton, are localized in developing axons and
growth cones, and that this localization is mediated by an axonal
targeting element located in the RhoA 3-prime untranslated region.
Sema3A (603961) induces intraaxonal translation of RhoA mRNA, and this
local translation of RhoA is necessary and sufficient for
Sema3A-mediated growth cone collapse. Wu et al. (2005) concluded that
their studies indicate that local RhoA translation regulates the
neuronal cytoskeleton and identify a new mechanism for the regulation of
RhoA signaling.

RhoA signaling plays a critical role in many cellular processes,
including cell migration. Valderrama et al. (2006) showed that the
vaccinia F11L protein interacts directly with RhoA, inhibiting its
signaling by blocking the interaction with its downstream effectors ROCK
(601702) and mammalian Dia (300108). RNA interference-mediated depletion
of F11L during infection resulted in the absence of vaccinia-induced
cell motility and inhibition of viral morphogenesis. Disruption of the
RhoA binding site in F11L, which resembles that of ROCK, led to an
identical phenotype. Thus, Valderrama et al. (2006) concluded that
inhibition of RhoA signaling is required for both vaccinia morphogenesis
and virus-induced cell motility.

Pertz et al. (2006) used a fluorescent biosensor, based on a novel
design preserving reversible membrane interactions, to visualize the
spatiotemporal dynamics of RhoA activity during cell migration. In
randomly migrating cells, RhoA activity is concentrated in a sharp band
directly at the edge of protrusions. It is observed sporadically in
retracting tails, and is low in the cell body. RhoA activity is also
associated with peripheral ruffles and pinocytic vesicles, but not with
dorsal ruffles induced by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF; see
173430). In contrast to randomly migrating cells, PDGF-induced membrane
protrusions have low RhoA activity, potentially because PDGF strongly
activates Rac, which had been shown to antagonize RhoA activity. Pertz
et al. (2006) concluded that different extracellular cues induce
distinct patterns of RhoA signaling during membrane protrusion.

Yoshida et al. (2006) found that in S. cerevisiae the small GTP-binding
protein RhoA stimulates type 2 myosin contractility and formin (FMN1;
136535)-dependent assembly of the cytokinetic actin contractile ring.
Yoshida et al. (2006) found that budding yeast Polo-like kinase Cdc5
(see 602868) controls the targeting and activation of RhoA at the
division site via Rho1 guanine nucleotide exchange factors. Yoshida et
al. (2006) concluded that this role of Cdc5 (Polo-like kinase) in
regulating Rho1 is likely to be relevant to cytokinesis and asymmetric
cell division in other organisms.

Canman et al. (2008) noted that, during cytokinesis, RhoA orchestrates
contractile ring assembly and constriction. RhoA signaling is controlled
by the central spindle, a set of microtubule bundles that forms between
the separating chromosomes. Centralspindlin is a protein complex
consisting of kinesin-6 ZEN4 (KIF23; 605064) and the Rho
GTPase-activating protein CYK4 (RACGAP1; 604980) and is required for
central spindle assembly and cytokinesis in C. elegans. Canman et al.
(2008) found that 2 separation-of-function mutations in the GAP domain
of CYK4 lead to cytokinesis defects that mimic centralspindlin loss of
function. These defects could be rescued by depletion of RAC or its
effectors, but not by depletion of RhoA. Canman et al. (2008) concluded
that inactivation of RAC by CYK4 functions in parallel with RhoA
activation to drive contractile ring constriction during cytokinesis.

Machacek et al. (2009) examined GTPase coordination in mouse embryonic
fibroblasts both through simultaneous visualization of 2 GTPase
biosensors and using a 'computational multiplexing' approach capable of
defining the relationships between multiple protein activities
visualized in separate experiments. They found that RhoA is activated at
the cell edge synchronous with edge advancement, whereas Cdc42 (116952)
and Rac1 (602048) are activated 2 microns behind the edge with a delay
of 40 seconds. This indicates that Rac1 and RhoA operate
antagonistically through spatial separation and precise timing, and that
RhoA has a role in the initial events of protrusion, whereas Rac1 and
Cdc42 activate pathways implicated in reinforcement and stabilization of
newly expanded protrusions.

Wu et al. (2009) developed an approach to produce genetically encoded
photoactivatable derivatives of Rac1, a key GTPase regulating actin
cytoskeletal dynamics in metazoan cells. Rac1 mutants were fused to the
photoreactive LOV (light oxygen voltage) domain from phototropin,
sterically blocking Rac1 interactions until irradiation unwound a helix
linking LOV to Rac1. Photoactivatable Rac1 (PA-Rac1) could be reversibly
and repeatedly activated using 458- or 473-nm light to generate
precisely localized cell protrusions and ruffling. Localized Rac
activation or inactivation was sufficient to produce cell motility and
control the direction of cell movement. Myosin was involved in Rac
control of directionality but not in Rac-induced protrusion, whereas PAK
was required for Rac-induced protrusion. PA-Rac1 was used to elucidate
Rac regulation of RhoA in cell motility. Rac and Rho coordinate
cytoskeletal behaviors with seconds and submicrometer precision. Rac was
shown to inhibit RhoA in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, with inhibition
modulated at protrusions and ruffles. A PA-Rac crystal structure and
modeling revealed LOV-Rac interactions that will facilitate extension of
this photoactivation approach to other proteins.

In studies in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), Guilluy et al. (2010)
demonstrated that ARHGEF1 (601855) is specifically responsible for
angiotensin receptor-1 (AGTR1; 106165)-mediated RHOA activation through
a mechanism involving the phosphorylation of tyr738 in ARHGEF1 by JAK2
(147796). Guilluy et al. (2010) generated mice lacking Arhgef1 in VSMCs
and found that the mutant mice were protected against angiotensin II
(see 106150)-dependent hypertension without alteration in baseline blood
pressure or the response to other vasoactive factors. Guilluy et al.
(2010) concluded that control of RHOA signaling through ARHGEF1 is
central to the development of angiotensin II-dependent hypertension.

Murakoshi et al. (2011) used 2-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging
microscopy to monitor the activity of 2 Rho GTPases, RhoA and Cdc42, in
single dendritic spines undergoing structural plasticity associated with
long-term potentiation in CA1 pyramidal neurons in cultured slices of
rat hippocampus. When long-term volume increase was induced in a single
spine using 2-photon glutamate uncaging, RhoA and Cdc42 were rapidly
activated in the stimulated spine. These activities decayed over about 5
minutes, and were then followed by a phase of persistent activation
lasting more than half an hour. Although active RhoA and Cdc42 were
similarly mobile, their activity patterns were different. RhoA
activation diffused out of the stimulated spine and spread over about 5
microns along the dendrite. In contrast, Cdc42 activation was restricted
to the stimulated spine, and exhibited a steep gradient at the spine
necks. Inhibition of the Rho-Rock pathway preferentially inhibited the
initial spine growth, whereas the inhibition of the Cdc42-Pak pathway
blocked the maintenance of sustained structural plasticity. RhoA and
Cdc42 activation depended on calcium ion/calmodulin-dependent kinase
(CaMKII). Thus, Murakoshi et al. (2011) concluded that RhoA and Cdc42
relay transient CaMKII activation to synapse-specific, long-term
signaling required for spine structural plasticity.

ANIMAL MODEL

Bivalacqua et al. (2004) studied the contribution of RhoA/Rho kinase
signaling to erectile dysfunction in streptozotocin (STZ) diabetic rats.
Rho kinase and eNOS (163729) colocalized in the endothelium of corpus
cavernosum, and RhoA and Rho kinase abundance and Mypt1 (602021)
phosphorylation were elevated in STZ diabetic rat penis. In addition,
eNOS protein expression, cavernosal constitutive NOS activity, and cGMP
levels were reduced in STZ diabetic rat penis. Bivalacqua et al. (2004)
introduced a dominant-negative RhoA mutant and found that erectile
responses in the STZ diabetic rats improved to values similar to
controls.

615313	TITLE *615313 BETA-1,3-N-ACETYLGLUCOSAMINYLTRANSFERASE 7; B3GNT7
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases, such as B3GNT7, catalyze the
transfer of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues from UDP-GlcNAc to the
C-3 position of nonreducing terminal galactose (Gal) or GalNAc by
beta-linkage (Seko and Yamashita, 2004).

CLONING

Kataoka and Huh (2002) cloned mouse B3gnt7 from a placenta cDNA library;
by database analysis, they identified human B3GNT7. Mouse and human
B3GNT7 encode proteins of 397 and 401 amino acids, respectively, and the
proteins share 87% identity. Mouse B3gnt7 is a type II transmembrane
protein with a short N-terminal signal/transmembrane domain and an
approximately 200-amino acid galactosyltransferase domain. It also has a
single putative N-glycosylation site and 5 cysteine residues, both of
which are conserved in the deduced human ortholog. Northern blot
analysis of mouse tissues detected variable expression of a 3-kb
transcript in all tissues examined except liver and skeletal muscle.
Highest expression was detected in mature placenta and colon.

Seko and Yamashita (2004) cloned human B3GNT7 from a colon cDNA library.

GENE FUNCTION

Using an antisense oligonucleotide, Kataoka and Huh (2002) found that
knockdown of B3gnt7 enhanced motility and invasiveness of mouse lung
cancer cells. Using the crude membrane fraction from COS-7 cells
expressing B3GNT7 to measure the enzyme's activity, Seko and Yamashita
(2004) found that B3GNT7 efficiently elongated keratan sulfate-related
glycans by the addition of GlcNAc to the C-3 position of the distal Gal.
The optimal pH with keratan sulfates was 6.5 to 7.0, and the reaction
required manganese chloride (MnCl2). B3GNT7 also recognized internal
6-O-sulfated GlcNAc. Lacto-N-tetraose and lacto-N-neo-tetraose were poor
substrates.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kataoka and Huh (2002) determined that the B3GNT7 gene contains 2 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Kataoka and Huh (2002) mapped the B3GNT7
gene to chromosome 2q37.1.

612546	TITLE *612546 WILLIAMS-BEUREN SYNDROME CHROMOSOME REGION 27; WBSCR27
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching EST databases for sequences mapping to the region of
chromosome 7 deleted in Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS; 194050), Micale
et al. (2008) identified and cloned WBSCR27. They also identified the
mouse Wbscr27 gene. The mouse and human WBSCR27 proteins contain a
methyltransferase domain. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues
detected several Wbscr27 variants, with highest expression in liver and
kidney.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Micale et al. (2008) mapped the WBSCR27
gene to chromosome 7q11.23 within the interval deleted in WBS. They
mapped the mouse Wbscr27 gene to a syntenic region of chromosome 5G1.

606109	TITLE *606109 NUDC DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; NUDCD1
;;IMMUNOGENIC TUMOR ANTIGEN CML66; CML66
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening a chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML; 608232) cDNA
expression library, followed by screening a normal human testis cDNA
library, Yang et al. (2001) cloned the NUDCD1 gene, which they called
CML66. The CML66 gene encodes a 583-amino acid protein with a molecular
mass of 66 kD that is expressed in leukemias and a variety of solid
tumor cell lines. Northern blot analysis showed expression in normal
tissues restricted to testis and heart, and no expression was found in
hematopoietic tissues. Expression in CML cells examined by quantitative
RT-PCR was 1.5-fold higher than in normal peripheral blood mononuclear
cells. The presence of CML66-specific antibody in patient serum was
confirmed by Western blot and the development of high-titer IgG antibody
specific for CML66 correlated with immune-induced remission of CML in a
patient who received infusion of normal donor lymphocytes for treatment
of relapse. CML66 antibody also was found in sera from 18 to 38% of
patients with lung cancer, melanoma, or prostate cancer. Yang et al.
(2001) suggested that CML66 may be immunogenic in a wide variety of
malignancies and may be a target for antigen-specific immunotherapy.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Yang et al. (2001) mapped the
NUDCD1 gene to chromosome 8q23.

610218	TITLE *610218 SAP30-BINDING PROTEIN; SAP30BP
;;HUMAN TRANSCRIPTION REGULATOR PROTEIN; HTRP;;
HCNGP;;
HTRG
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a differential display approach, Li et al. (2004) cloned SAP30BP,
which they called HTRP, from a cDNA library constructed from a human
embryo fibroblast cell line (KMB-17) infected with herpes simplex
virus-1 (HSV-1) for 2 hours. The deduced 308-amino acid protein contains
a bipartite nuclear localization signal and an LXXXIXXL motif similar to
a motif in nuclear receptor corepressor N-CoR (NCOR1; 600849). By
Northern blot analysis, they detected a 1,350-nucleotide transcript in
human embryo fibroblasts infected with HSV-1 but absent from uninfected
fibroblasts, and they detected HTRP mRNA in human brain, heart, liver,
lung, spleen, and kidney. By fluorescence microscopy, Li et al. (2004)
localized HTRP to the nucleus of HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using TUNEL analysis of human embryo fibroblasts transfected with HTRP,
Li et al. (2004) demonstrated that HTRP induced cell death. By yeast
2-hybrid analysis, they identified SAP30 (603378), a component of the
SIN3 histone deacetylase complex (see 607776), as a binding partner of
HTRP. Further analysis of HTRP deletion mutants showed that the
N-terminal domain prior to amino acid 225 is responsible for specific
HTRP-SAP30 binding. In vitro GST pull-down assays and in vivo
immunoprecipitation showed that HTRP interacted with at least 3 proteins
including SAP30; however, the identity of the additional 2 proteins was
not determined. Li et al. (2004) suggested that HTRP may be involved in
cellular corepression of transcription and inhibition of cell survival.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SAP30BP
gene to chromosome 17 (TMAP RH46479).

604477	TITLE *604477 CHROMOBOX HOMOLOG 3; CBX3
;;HP1, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, GAMMA;;
HP1-GAMMA
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

At the nuclear envelope in higher eukaryotic cells, the nuclear lamina
and the heterochromatin are adjacent to the inner nuclear membrane.
Using the nucleoplasmic N terminus of lamin B receptor (LBR; 600024), an
integral protein of the inner nuclear membrane, as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Ye and Worman (1996) showed
that LBR binds to 2 chromodomain proteins that are homologs of
Drosophila HP1. One of these proteins, CBX3, contains 173 amino acids
and shows 65% sequence similarity with the other protein, CBX5 (604478).

GENE FUNCTION

Ye and Worman (1996) found that LBR fusion proteins bound to CBX
proteins synthesized by in vitro translation and present in cell
lysates. LBR also coimmunoprecipitated the CBX proteins from cell
extracts. Ye and Worman (1996) suggested that the interaction between
LBR and the chromodomain proteins may explain, in part, the association
of heterochromatin with the inner nuclear membrane.

Following overexpression of MIS12 (609178) in HeLa cells, Obuse et al.
(2004) immunoprecipitated several proteins, including HP1-gamma, that
interacted with MIS12 in a kinetochore-associated complex. Both
HP1-alpha (CBX5) and HP1-gamma interacted directly with MIS12 and
C20ORF172 (609175). Using HP1 RNA interference (RNAi), Obuse et al.
(2004) found that HP1-alpha and HP1-gamma were functionally redundant.
In double HP1 RNAi, the integrity of kinetochores was abolished and
micronuclei were formed. Obuse et al. (2004) hypothesized that the firm
association of heterochromatic HP1 with the MIS12 complex may be a
fundamental feature of human kinetochore formation.

Fischle et al. (2005) demonstrated that HP1-alpha (604478), HP1-beta
(604511), and HP1-gamma are released from chromatin during the M phase
of the cell cycle even though trimethylation levels of histone H3 (see
602810) lys9 remain unchanged. However, the additional transient
modification of histone H3 by phosphorylation of ser10 next to the more
stable methyl-lys9 mark is sufficient to eject HP1 proteins from their
binding sites. Inhibition or depletion of the mitotic kinase Aurora B
(604970), which phosphorylates histone H3 on ser10, causes retention of
HP1 proteins on mitotic chromosomes, suggesting that H3 ser10
phosphorylation is necessary for the dissociation of HP1 from chromatin
in M phase. Fischle et al. (2005) concluded that their findings
establish a regulatory mechanism of protein-protein interactions,
through a combinatorial readout of 2 adjacent posttranslational
modifications: a stable methylation and a dynamic phosphorylation mark.

Smallwood et al. (2007) demonstrated that DNMT1 (126375) could interact
with HP1-alpha, HP1-beta, and HP1-gamma in a human colon carcinoma cell
line, resulting in stimulation of DNMT1 methyltransferase activity. The
HP1 proteins were sufficient to target DNMT1 activity in vivo, and
HP1-dependent repression required DNMT1. Smallwood et al. (2007)
demonstrated that HP1-alpha and HP1-beta were recruited to the survivin
(BIRC5; 603352) promoter in a DNMT1-dependent manner, whereas HP1-gamma
was present when the survivin gene was active. They concluded that
direct interactions between HP1 proteins and DNMT1 mediate silencing of
euchromatic genes.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Mapping Consortium mapped the CBX3 gene to
chromosome 7 (TMAP SHGC-57830).

164910	TITLE *164910 V-REL AVIAN RETICULOENDOTHELIOSIS VIRAL ONCOGENE HOMOLOG; REL
;;ONCOGENE REL;;
C-REL
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The REL gene encodes c-Rel, a transcription factor that is a member of
the Rel/NFKB family, which also includes RELA (164014), RELB (604758),
NFKB1 (164011), and NFKB2 (164012). These proteins are related through a
highly conserved N-terminal region termed the 'Rel domain,' which is
responsible for DNA binding, dimerization, nuclear localization, and
binding to the NFKB inhibitor (164008) (Belguise and Sonenshein, 2007).

CLONING

Brownell et al. (1985) isolated a partial genomic segment corresponding
to the REL gene. Subsequently, Brownell et al. (1989) cloned full-length
REL from a human Daudi cell cDNA library.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, Brownell et al. (1986) assigned the REL locus
to 2p13-2cen. They assigned it also to mouse 11 which has shown no
homology to human chromosome 2 and to feline chromosome A3 which does
show homology to human 2p. By translocation chromosome analysis,
Brownell et al. (1988) mapped the REL gene to chromosome 2p13-p12.

GENE FUNCTION

Romieu-Mourez et al. (2003) noted that amplification, overexpression, or
rearrangement of the c-rel gene has been detected in solid and
hematologic malignancies, including breast cancer (114480).

Belguise and Sonenshein (2007) identified the estrogen receptor-alpha
(ESR1; 133430) as a potent inhibitor of c-Rel DNA binding in murine
mammary gland tissue and tumors. Further studies identified protein
kinase C-theta (PRKCQ; 600448) as a positive regulator of c-Rel
transcriptional activity, as well as downstream target genes. In human
breast cancer cell lines, there was an inverse correlation between ESR1
and PRKCQ mRNA, and PRKCQ was found to inhibit ESR1 expression via
activation of AKT1 (164730). Belguise and Sonenshein (2007) concluded
that PRKCQ plays a pivotal role in mammary tumorigenesis by activating
AKT, which ultimately leads to derepression of c-Rel through inhibition
of ESR1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

For a discussion of a possible association between variation in the REL
gene and susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis, see 180300.

ANIMAL MODEL

Romieu-Mourez et al. (2003) developed a mouse model in which the mouse
c-rel gene was driven by a hormone-dependent mouse mammary tumor virus
promoter (MMTV). Approximately 32% of female transgenic mice developed
late-onset mammary tumors at an average age of 19.9 months. Mammary
tumors were of diverse histology and expressed increased levels of
nuclear Nfkb. There was also increased expression of cancer-related Nfkb
target genes, including cyclin D1 (CCND1; 168461) and c-myc (190080).
The findings indicated that dysregulated expression of c-rel is capable
of contributing to mammary tumorigenesis.

Gugasyan et al. (2004) demonstrated that c-rel is expressed in the
epidermis and hair follicles of normal mouse embryos. Mutant mice
lacking both c-rel and RelA displayed multiple epidermal defects,
including thin epidermis and failure to form tylotrich hair. Although
mutant keratinocytes underwent terminal differentiation, mutant basal
keratinocytes were abnormally small, showed growth delay, and failed to
form colonies in culture. The findings indicated that c-rel and RelA
regulate skin development in a redundant manner and that both are
required for normal epidermal development in mice.

606817	TITLE *606817 PRE-T-CELL RECEPTOR, ALPHA-CHAIN PRECURSOR; PTCRA
;;PT-ALPHA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

In immature T cells the T-cell receptor beta-chain (TCRB; see 186930) is
rearranged and expressed before the TCRA (see 186880) chain. At this
early stage, TCRB can associate with the pre-T-cell receptor alpha chain
(PTCRA). The PTCRA, together with TCRB and the CD3 complex (see 186740),
minimally make up the pre-T cell receptor (pre-TCR), which regulates
early T cell development.

CLONING

Using a cDNA corresponding to mouse Ptcra as a probe to screen a human
thymus cDNA library, followed by 5- and 3-prime RACE, Del Porto et al.
(1995) isolated a cDNA encoding a protein they named PTA for 'pre-T-cell
receptor alpha chain.' The deduced 282-amino acid type I transmembrane
protein, 63% identical to the mouse protein, contains a leader sequence,
an Ig constant domain-like extracellular region with a potential
N-glycosylation site, a transmembrane region, and a 114-amino acid
cytoplasmic tail with 3 potential phosphorylation sites. The tail is
much longer than that in the mouse protein. Southern blot analysis
suggested the presence of a similar sequence in all species examined,
but the cytoplasmic tail region appears to be restricted to primates.
RT-PCR analysis detected expression in immature, but not mature,
thymocyte subsets with strongest expression in CD4+/CD8-/CD3-low cells
on their way to differentiate into CD4/CD8 double-positive thymocytes.

GENE STRUCTURE

By analysis of a chromosome 6 cosmid library, Saint-Ruf et al. (1998)
determined that the PTCRA gene contains 4 exons with a first intron rich
in repetitive Alu sequences and SINE and LINE elements. Analysis of the
region 1.5 kb upstream of the ATG start codon detected no CAAT or TATA
boxes or a potential promoter. However, the conserved 6.5-kb intron 1
contains binding sites for AP1 (165160) and for mu-EBP-C2. RT-PCR
analysis identified a smaller splice variant, PT-alpha-2, encoding a
231-amino acid protein lacking a major part of the Ig-like domain, due
to the elimination of exon 2. The variant lacks a potential
N-glycosylation site but retains a number of potential O-glycosylation
sites.

MAPPING

By radiolabeled in situ hybridization analysis, Del Porto et al. (1995)
mapped the PTCRA gene to chromosome 6p21.2-p12. The authors noted that
the mouse gene is localized to chromosome 17, also in the area of the
major histocompatibility complex. Saint-Ruf et al. (1998) refined the
localization to 6p21.3 by Southern blot and genomic sequence analysis.

ANIMAL MODEL

By expressing Ptcra mutants in transgenic mice and in cell lines,
Aifantis et al. (2002) showed that the conserved juxtamembrane cysteine
that could be a target for palmitoylation appears to be dispensable for
pre-TCR function. The nonconserved mouse cytoplasmic region,
particularly its somewhat conserved proline-rich domain, is required for
effective selection, proliferation, and survival of Tcrb-expressing
immature thymocytes.

612173	TITLE *612173 SPERM-ASSOCIATED ANTIGEN 16; SPAG16
;;PF20
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cilia and flagella are comprised of a microtubular backbone, the
axoneme, which is organized by the basal body and surrounded by plasma
membrane. SPAG16 encodes 2 major proteins that associate with the
axoneme of sperm tail and the nucleus of postmeiotic germ cells,
respectively (Zhang et al., 2007).

CLONING

By searching EST databases for sequences similar to Chlamydomonas pf20,
followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE of a testis cDNA library, Pennarun
et al. (2002) cloned SPAG16. The 631-amino acid full-length protein has
5 C-terminal WD repeats and a polyadenylation signal. Northern blot
analysis of human tissues detected a 2.4-kb transcript highly expressed
in testis only, and weak expression of a 1.4-kb transcript in testis,
trachea, liver, brain, and kidney. RT-PCR confirmed testis-specific
expression of the 2.4-kb transcript and ubiquitous expression of the
1.4-kb transcript. RT-PCR also revealed 2 additional splice variants
missing exon 12 and exon 4, respectively.

Using mouse Spag16 as probe, Zhang et al. (2002) independently cloned
SPAG16 from a testis cDNA library. The deduced 639-amino acid mouse
protein contains a coiled-coil region followed by up to 7 contiguous WD
repeats. Northern blot analysis detected transcripts of 1.4 and 2.5 kb
only in mouse and human testis. A 1-kb transcript was also detected in
human testis. Sequence analysis revealed the longer mouse transcript
included all coding exons and the shorter transcript, which appeared to
arise from an alternative transcription start site, contained only the
5-prime exons. The shorter transcript was predicted to encode a protein
containing only the WD repeats. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed
Spag16 localized to the axoneme central apparatus of mouse sperm.
Fluorescence-tagged Spag16 accumulated on a subset of polymerized
microtubules in Chinese hamster ovary cells and colocalized with Spag6
(605730).

By Western blot analysis, Zhang et al. (2004) found that mouse Spag16
was expressed as 2 major proteins with apparent molecular masses of 71
and 35 kD. Both contained contiguous WD repeats in their C termini. The
71-kD protein was incorporated into the central apparatus of the sperm
tail, whereas the 35-kD protein accumulated in postmeiotic male germ
cells and was abundant in nuclei.

By 5-prime RACE of human testis cDNA, Zhang et al. (2007) cloned the
human homolog of the short form of mouse Spag16, which they designated
SPAG16S. The full-length form was designated SPAG16L. Western blot
analysis of normal human sperm detected major proteins with apparent
molecular masses of 71 and 35 kD. Minor proteins between 50 and 71 kD
were also detected in human sperm, but not mouse.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Zhang et al. (2002) demonstrated a direct
interaction between mouse Spag16 and Spag6. Sperm from Spag6-deficient
mice had reduced levels of Spag16 protein; however, the level of Spag16
mRNA was comparable to that of wildtype mice, suggesting that the Spag16
protein is degraded in the absence of Spag6.

Zhang et al. (2004) showed that the 35-kD mouse Spag16 protein bound
Meig1 (614174), a chromosome/chromatin-binding protein initially
expressed during meiosis but retained in the germ cell nucleus
throughout later stages of spermatogenesis.

Zhang et al. (2007) stated that mouse Spag16l is essential for sperm
flagellar motility, whereas Spag16s appears to be required for
postmeiotic germ cell viability.

Wilson et al. (2009) demonstrated that mouse Fu (607652) interacts with
the central pair protein Spag16 in the assembly or maintenance of the
central pair apparatus.

GENE STRUCTURE

Pennarun et al. (2002) determined that the SPAG16 gene contains 16 exons
and spans at least 344 kb. Zhang et al. (2007) identified an
untranslated exon 10a that is utilized by the SPAG16S transcript.

MAPPING

Using FISH, Pennarun et al. (2002) mapped the SPAG16 gene to chromosome
2q34. Zhang et al. (2002) mapped the mouse Spag16 gene to a region of
chromosome 1 that shares homology of synteny with human chromosome 2q34.

ANIMAL MODEL

Zhang et al. (2004) disrupted the WD repeat-encoding exons of mouse
Pf20. All mutant mice were viable and showed no gross abnormalities,
however, male mice carrying the mutant Pf20 allele had impaired
spermatogenesis with significant disorganization of sperm axoneme
structure. The mutated Pf20 allele was never transmitted, indicating
that Pf20 haploinsufficiency caused defects in spermatogenesis.

;;SEC8, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; SEC8;;
KIAA1699
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SEC8 is part of a multiprotein complex involved in vesicle trafficking
at neural synapses and vesicle targeting in polarized epithelial cells
(Hsu et al., 1996; Grindstaff et al., 1998).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned SEC8, which they designated
KIAA1699. The deduced protein contains 966 amino acids and shares 95%
identity with rat Sec8. RT-PCR ELISA detected moderate expression in all
tissues and specific brain regions examined. Slightly elevated
expression was detected in skeletal muscle, ovary, spleen, and thalamus.

GENE FUNCTION

Hsu et al. (1996) purified rat brain Sec8, which was present in a 743-kD
complex with Sec6 (608186) and 6 other proteins. The complex was broadly
expressed in rat brain and displayed a plasma membrane localization in
nerve terminals. Immunofluorescence microscopy detected Sec8 throughout
cultured rat hippocampal neurons, including cell bodies, dendrites,
axons, and nerve terminals. Brighter staining was observed at synapses.
The Sec6/Sec8 complex coimmunoprecipitated with syntaxin (see 186590).
Hsu et al. (1996) concluded that the rat Sec6/Sec8 complex is involved
in neurotransmitter release via interactions with the core vesicle
docking and fusion apparatus.

Grindstaff et al. (1998) found that the Sec6/Sec8 complex was a
component of a cytosolic 17S complex in nonpolarized canine kidney
epithelial cells. Upon initiation of calcium-dependent cell-cell
adhesion, about 70% of the complex was recruited to sites of cell-cell
contact. Antibodies against Sec8 inhibited delivery of low density
lipoprotein receptor (606945) to the basolateral membrane. Grindstaff et
al. (1998) concluded that lateral membrane recruitment of the Sec6/Sec8
complex is a consequence of cell-cell adhesion and is essential for the
development of epithelial cell surface polarity.

MAPPING

Gross (2011) mapped the EXOC4 gene to chromosome 7q31 based on an
alignment of the EXOC4 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC026174) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

REGULATORY ELEMENT, CIS-ACTING, ENHANCER, 21.7 KB UPSTREAM OF ATOH7,
INCLUDED; RECE-ATOH7, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ATOH7 is a member of the family of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)
proteins with similarity to Drosophila 'atonal,' a proneural bHLH gene
that controls photoreceptor development (Brown et al., 2002).

CLONING

Using the mouse Atoh7/Math5 cDNA to screen a genomic library, Brown et
al. (2002) isolated human ATOH7 clones. Using database sequence
analysis, they identified the corresponding ATOH7 cDNA, which encodes a
protein that shares high sequence homology with mouse Atoh7.

GENE STRUCTURE

Brown et al. (2002) determined that the ATOH7 gene contains a single
exon.

MAPPING

By FISH, Brown et al. (2002) mapped the human ATOH7 gene to chromosome
10q21.3-q22.1; this region shows syntenic homology with the mouse
chromosome 10 location identified for Atoh7 by Brown et al. (1998).

GENE FUNCTION

Brown et al. (1998) determined that mouse Atoh7 is expressed in the
developing optic cup, beginning at embryonic day 11.5, in a temporal and
spatial pattern that coincides with retinal ganglion cell formation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In an Iranian family with nonsyndromic congenital retinal nonattachment
(RNANC; 221900) mapping to chromosome 10q21, originally studied by
Ghiasvand et al. (1998), Ghiasvand et al. (2011) identified a 6.5-kb
deletion located 21.7 to 15.2 kb upstream of the ATOH7 transcription
start site that segregated completely with disease in the family
(609875.0001). The deletion removed a cluster of 3 conserved noncoding
elements (CNEs). Comparison of activity of the primary enhancer in the
ATOH7 region and the remote CNEs demonstrated transgene expression
patterns that overlapped both spatially and temporally. Ghiasvand et al.
(2011) concluded that RNANC is caused by deletion of this remote
enhancer of the ATOH7 gene.

ANIMAL MODEL

Brown et al. (2001) generated mice lacking Atoh7. The mutant mice had
eyes but lacked retinal ganglion cells and optic nerves. Brown et al.
(2001) concluded that Atoh7 plays a central role in retinal ganglion
cell and optic nerve formation.

610930	TITLE *610930 ORAI CALCIUM RELEASE-ACTIVATED CALCIUM MODULATOR 3; ORAI3
;;TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN 142C; TMEM142C
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database analysis, Feske et al. (2006) identified human ORAI1
(610277), ORAI2 (610929), and ORAI3 as homologs of a Drosophila gene,
Orai, that they identified through an RNA interference screen for
regulators of store-operated calcium entry and nuclear factor of
activated T cells (NFAT; see 600489) nuclear import. In Greek mythology,
the Orai are the keepers of the gates of heaven: Eunomia (Order or
Harmony), Dike (Justice), and Eirene (Peace).

GENE FUNCTION

Mercer et al. (2006) showed that coexpression of STIM1 (605921) with
ORAI3 did not augment store-operated Ca(2+) entry, unlike coexpression
of STIM1 with ORAI1 or ORAI2. However, ORAI3 could rescue ORAI1 function
that had been inhibited by RNA interference.

MAPPING

Feske et al. (2006) stated that the ORAI3 gene maps to chromosome 16.

612202	TITLE *612202 SRY-BOX 7; SOX7
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the SOX gene family, including SOX7, contain a 79-amino acid
DNA-binding domain known as the HMG (high mobility group) box. SOX
proteins are transcription factors with critical roles in the regulation
of diverse developmental processes Takash et al. (2001).

CLONING

By PCR of a fetal thymus cDNA library using primers based on mouse Sox7,
followed by EST database analysis, Takash et al. (2001) obtained the
full-length SOX7 sequence. The deduced 388-amino acid protein contains
an N-terminal HMG box including 2 putative nuclear localization signals
at both ends of the domain. The deduced mouse and human proteins share
87.4% amino acid identity, with 100% identity in the HMG box. Northern
blot analysis of human tissues detected variable expression of a major
5-kb transcript in all tissues examined. A transcript of about 2.5 kb
was also detected in adult colon and fetal lung, along with a slightly
larger transcript in fetal lung. Sox7 was also detected in all adult
mouse tissues examined and in embryonic mouse between 9.5 and 17.5 days
postcoitum. In situ hybridization of 8-week-old human embryos detected
SOX7 in brain, tongue, heart, liver, lung, and vertebrae. In embryonic
mouse, Sox7 expression was detected in somites and head region at 8 days
postcoitum, and in brain, cochlea, tongue, cartilage, lung, liver, and
vertebrae at 17.5 days postcoitum. Epitope-tagged mouse Sox7 localized
to the nucleus of transfected COS-7 cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Takash et al. (2001) stated that the recombinant HMG box of mouse Sox7
binds to the sequence AACAAT. Transfection experiments done in COS-7
cells revealed that full-length mouse Sox7 activated a SOX reporter
gene, and Sox7 carrying deletions in the C-terminal domain failed to
activate transcription. In cotransfected 293 cells, Sox7 reduced Wnt
(see WNT1; 164820)/beta-catenin (see CTNNB1; 116806)- stimulated
transcription.

Murakami et al. (2004) found that the transcription factor Gata4
(600576) bound PS4A, a key regulatory element of the mouse Fgf3 (164950)
promoter. Using nuclear extracts from endoderm-like differentiated mouse
F9 cells, they detected complexes of Sox2 (184429), Sox7, and Sox17
(610928) on PS4A; however, only Sox7 markedly activated the Fgf3
promoter in these cells. Sox7 competed with Gata4 for PS4A occupancy and
to activate the Fgf3 promoter. In situ hybridization showed that Sox7
was coexpressed with Fgf3 and Gata4 in mouse parietal endoderm at
embryonic day 7.5. In culture, Gata4-deficient embryonal stem cells
expressed low levels of Fgf3 upon differentiation into embryoid bodies,
and Fgf3 expression was virtually abolished when Sox7 expression was
suppressed by RNA interference. Murakami et al. (2004) concluded that
SOX7 is a potent activator of FGF3 transcription.

GENE STRUCTURE

Takash et al. (2001) determined that the SOX7 gene contains at least 2
exons.

MAPPING

Using FISH, Takash et al. (2001) mapped the SOX7 gene to chromosome 8p22
and the mouse Sox7 gene to a region of chromosome 14D that shares
homology of synteny with human chromosome 8p22.

ANIMAL MODEL

The zebrafish homologs of Sox7 and Sox18 (601618) are expressed in
angioblasts and in the endothelial component of nascent blood vessels in
embryos. Cermenati et al. (2008) found that knockdown of either gene had
minimal effects on vessels; however, simultaneous knockdown of both
genes resulted in multiple fusions between the major axial vessels.
Using transgenic lines and molecular markers, they showed that
endothelial cells were specified, but failed to acquire correct
arteriovenous identity. Venous endothelial cell differentiation was more
severely affected than arterial. Cermenati et al. (2008) concluded that
Sox7 and Sox18 play redundant but collectively essential roles in the
establishment of arteriovenous identity in zebrafish.

610907	TITLE *610907 VACUOLAR PROTEIN SORTING 25, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; VPS25
;;ELL-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN, 20-KD; EAP20
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

VPS25, VPS36 (610903), and SNF8 (610904) form ESCRT-II (endosomal
sorting complex required for transport II), a complex involved in
endocytosis of ubiquitinated membrane proteins. VPS25, VPS36, and SNF8
are also associated in a multiprotein complex with RNA polymerase II
elongation factor (ELL; 600284) (Slagsvold et al., 2005; Kamura et al.,
2001).

CLONING

Kamura et al. (2001) purified the Ell-containing complex from rat liver
extracts, and by peptide sequencing and database analysis, they
identified mouse and human VPS25, which they called EAP20. The deduced
mouse and human proteins contain 176 amino acids, have calculated
molecular masses of 21 kD, and are identical.

GENE FUNCTION

Using mouse proteins expressed in mammalian and insect cells, Kamura et
al. (2001) found that Eap30 (SNF8) and Eap20 could be
coimmunoprecipitated in the absence of Eap45 (VPS36), and that Eap20 and
Eap45 could be coimmunoprecipitated in the absence of Eap30. However,
little Eap30 was coimmunoprecipitated with Eap45 in the absence of
Eap20. Kamura et al. (2001) concluded that EAP20 bridges EAP30 and EAP45
and thereby nucleates assembly of the EAP complex.

By coimmunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged proteins expressed in HEK293
cells, Yorikawa et al. (2005) showed that CHMP6 (610901) interacted with
CHMP4B (610897) and EAP20. In vitro pull-down assays using recombinant
proteins demonstrated direct physical interaction that was mediated by
the N-terminal basic half of CHMP6. Epitope-tagged EAP20 localized
diffusely in transfected HeLa cells, but it exhibited a punctate
distribution when coexpressed with CHMP6.

MAPPING

Hartz (2007) mapped the VPS25 gene to chromosome 17q21.3 based on an
alignment of the VPS25 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB014763) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

610571	TITLE *610571 FK506-BINDING PROTEIN 11; FKBP11
;;FK506-BINDING PROTEIN, 19-KD; FKBP19
DESCRIPTION For background information on FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs), see FKBP1A
(186945).

CLONING

By searching databases for putative FKBPs, Rulten et al. (2006) obtained
a full-length cDNA encoding FKBP11, which they called FKBP19. The
deduced 201-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 22 kD.
It has an N-terminal signal sequence, followed by a peptidyl-prolyl
isomerase domain, a transmembrane region, and a lysine-rich C-terminal
tail containing a variant of the dilysine motif found in endoplasmic
reticulum membrane proteins. Northern blot analysis detected high
expression of an 800-bp transcript in pancreas, with low levels in all
other tissues examined. RNA dot blot analysis revealed ubiquitous FKBP11
expression, with highest levels in pancreas and other secretory tissues,
such as stomach, pituitary, salivary gland, and lymph node.

GENE FUNCTION

Using an in vitro binding assay, Rulten et al. (2006) showed that FKBP11
bound FK506 weakly.

GENE STRUCTURE

Patterson et al. (2002) determined that the FKBP11 gene has 6 coding
exons. Rulten et al. (2006) identified 5 NKX2-5 (NKX2E; 600584)-binding
sites and 4 PAX4 (167413)-binding sites upstream of the FKBP11 coding
region.

MAPPING

Rulten et al. (2006) stated that the FKBP11 gene maps to chromosome

600427	TITLE *600427 E2F TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 3; E2F3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

See E2F1 (189971). Lees et al. (1993) identified this member of the E2F
family of transcription factors by screening a NALM-6 cell cDNA library
at low stringency with an E2F1 probe. Lees et al. (1993) also showed
that expressed E2F3 bound to both E2F DNA recognition sites and to the
RB1 protein (614041).

He et al. (2000) identified a truncated variant of E2F3, which they
called E2F3B, that is expressed via an alternative translation start
site. The E2F3B variant lacks 101 N-terminal amino acids relative to the
full-length protein, including a moderately conserved sequence present
only in the growth-promoting E2F family members. In contrast to
full-length E2F3, which is expressed only at the G1/S boundary, E2F3B is
expressed throughout the cell cycle, with peak levels in GO when it is
associated with RB.

GENE FUNCTION

MYC (190080) induces transcription of the E2F1, E2F2 (600426), and E2F3
genes. Using primary mouse embryo fibroblasts deleted for individual E2f
genes, Leone et al. (2001) showed that MYC-induced S phase and apoptosis
requires distinct E2F activities. The ability of Myc to induce S phase
was impaired in the absence of either E2f2 or E2f3 but not E2f1 or E2f4
(600659). In contrast, the ability of Myc to induce apoptosis was
markedly reduced in cells deleted for E2f1 but not E2f2 or E2f3. The
authors proposed that the induction of specific E2F activities is an
essential component in the MYC pathways that control cell proliferation
and cell fate decisions.

The RB1 pathway is believed to have a critical role in the control of
cellular proliferation by regulating E2F activities. E2F1, E2F2, and
E2F3 belong to a subclass of E2F factors thought to act as
transcriptional activators important for progression through the G1/S
transition. Wu et al. (2001) used a conditional gene targeting approach
to demonstrate that combined loss of these 3 E2F factors severely
affects E2F target expression and completely abolishes the ability of
mouse embryonic fibroblasts to enter S phase, progress through mitosis,
and proliferate. Loss of E2F function results in elevation of CIP1
(CDKN1A; 116899) protein, leading to a decrease in cyclin-dependent
kinase activity and Rb phosphorylation. Wu et al. (2001) concluded that
these findings suggest a function for this subclass of E2F
transcriptional activators in a positive feedback loop, through
downmodulation of CIP1, that leads to the inactivation of Rb-dependent
repression and S phase entry.

To address the function of E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3 in normal mammalian
cells in vivo, Chen et al. (2009) focused on the mouse retina, which is
a relatively simple central nervous system component that can be
manipulated genetically without compromising viability and has provided
considerable insight into development and cancer. Chen et al. (2009)
showed that unlike fibroblasts, E2f1-, E2f2-, and E2f3-null retinal
progenitor cells or activated Muller glia can divide. Chen et al. (2009)
attributed this effect to functional interchangeability with Mycn
(164840). However, loss of activating E2fs caused downregulation of the
p53 (191170) deacetylase Sirt1 (604479), p53 hyperacetylation, and
elevated apoptosis, establishing a novel E2f-Sirt1-p53 survival axis in
vivo. Chen et al. (2009) concluded that activating E2fs are not
universally required for normal mammalian cell division, but have an
unexpected prosurvival role in development.

Using a panel of tissue-specific cre-transgenic mice and conditional E2f
alleles, Chong et al. (2009) examined the effects of E2f1, E2f2, and
E2f3 triple deficiency in murine embryonic stem cells, embryos, and
small intestines. They showed that in normal dividing progenitor cells,
E2f1-3 function as transcriptional activators, but are dispensable for
cell division and instead are necessary for cell survival. In
differentiating cells E2f1-3 function in a complex with Rb (614041) as
repressors to silence E2f targets and facilitate exit from the cell
cycle. The inactivation of Rb in differentiating cells resulted in a
switch of E2f1-3 from repressors to activators, leading to the
superactivation of E2f-responsive targets and ectopic cell divisions.
Loss of E2f1-3 completely suppressed these phenotypes caused by Rb
deficiency. Chong et al. (2009) concluded that their work contextualizes
the activator versus repressor functions of E2f1-3 in vivo, revealing
distinct roles in dividing versus differentiating cells and in normal
versus cancer-like cell cycles.

MAPPING

Lees et al. (1993) mapped the E2F3 gene to 6q22 by fluorescence in situ
hybridization.

ANIMAL MODEL

By targeting the entire subclass of E2F transcriptional activators, Wu
et al. (2001) provided direct genetic evidence for their essential role
in cell cycle progression, proliferation, and development. Wu et al.
(2001) initially generated and interbred E2f1, E2f2, and E2f3 mutant
mice, and found that although mice null for E2f1 and E2f2 were viable
and developed to adulthood, mice null for E2f1 and E2f3 or E2f2 and E2f3
died early during embryonic development, at or just before embryonic day
9.5, pointing to a central role for E2f3 in mouse development.

Cloud et al. (2002) generated E2f3-null mice. They found that E2f3 was
essential for embryonic viability in the pure 129/Sv background, but
that the presence of C57BL/6 alleles yielded some adult survivors.
Although growth retarded, surviving E2f3 -/- animals were initially
healthy and exhibited no obvious tumor phenotype. They died prematurely,
however, with signs typical of congestive heart failure, a defect
completely distinct from those reported in E2f1-null mice. Cloud et al.
(2002) also generated E2f1/E2f3 compound mutant mice and found that
almost all of the developmental and age-related defects arising in the
individual E2f1- or E2f3-null mice were exacerbated by the mutation of
the other E2f. One major difference in the properties of E2f1 and E2f3
loss was that, either alone or in combination with loss of E2f1, E2f3
mutants did not show an increase in the incidence of tumor formation.

Aslanian et al. (2004) found that in wildtype mouse embryonic
fibroblasts (MEFs), the Arf promoter was occupied by E2f3 but not by any
other E2f family members. In quiescent cells, this role was largely
fulfilled by the E2f3b isoform. E2f3 loss was sufficient to derepress
Arf, triggering activation of p53 (191170) and expression of p21(Cip1).
Thus, E2f3 is a key repressor of the p19(Arf)-p53 pathway in normal
cells. Consistent with this, Arf mutation suppressed the activation of
p53 and p21(Cip1) in E2f3-deficient MEFs. Arf loss also rescued the cell
cycle reentry defect of E2f3-null cells, which correlated with
restoration of appropriate activation of classic E2f-responsive genes.

To begin to evaluate the genetic complexity of the E2F factors, Tsai et
al. (2008) targeted the inactivation of the entire subset of activators:
E2f1 (189971), E2f2 (600426), and E2f3a and 3b singly or in combination
in mice. They demonstrated that E2f3a is sufficient to support mouse
embryonic and postnatal development. Remarkably, expression of E2f3b or
E2f1 from the E2f3a locus suppressed all the postnatal phenotypes
associated with the inactivation of E2f3a. Tsai et al. (2008) concluded
that there is significant functional redundancy among activators and
that the specific requirement for E2f3a during postnatal development is
dictated by regulatory sequences governing its selective spatiotemporal
expression and not by its intrinsic protein functions, and that their
findings provided a molecular basis for the observed specificity among
E2F activators during development. Breeding double-knockout E2f3a and
E2f3b onto a pure strain background resulted in embryonic lethality.
Intercrossing E2f3 heterozygote mice of different pure backgrounds
restored viability of embryonic development.

607642	TITLE *607642 RETINOIC ACID-INDUCED GENE 1; RAI1
;;RETINOIC ACID-INDUCIBLE 1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Seranski et al. (1999) identified RAI1 within an unstable region of
chromosome 17p11.2 that is associated with several neurologic disorders
and malignant diseases. RT-PCR detected expression in all adult and
fetal tissues examined.

By cDNA selection, RT-PCR, and RACE using a fetal brain cDNA library,
Seranski et al. (2001) obtained a full-length RAI1 cDNA. The deduced
1,863-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal polyglutamine stretch
that is encoded by a polymorphic CAG repeat. The C terminus contains a
polyserine stretch and 3 RAI1 domains, which share similarity with
transcription factor-20 (TCF20; 603107). RAI1 has no potential
membrane-spanning hydrophobic domains. Northern blot analysis revealed
expression of several transcripts. An 8-kb transcript was expressed in
all adult and fetal tissues and brain regions examined, except fetal
liver. A 10-kb transcript was expressed weakly in heart, kidney,
pancreas, stomach, thyroid, spinal cord, and lymph node. A 1.5-kb
transcript was detected only in placenta.

By database analysis, Toulouse et al. (2003) determined that the CAG
repeat was contained within the coding region of RAI1. By assembling
ESTs and PCR of neuroblastoma cell line cDNA, cloned RAI1. The deduced
protein contains 1,906 amino acids and shares 79% identity with mouse
Rai1. Toulouse et al. (2003) noted that the polyglutamine tract encoded
by the CAG repeat contains up to 18 glutamines in RAI1, and only 4 in
the mouse homolog. Northern blot analysis confirmed expression of a
single 8-kb transcript in all human tissues examined. Heart and brain
showed highest expression. Northern blot analysis of individual brain
regions detected similar expression in all regions analyzed except
corpus callosum, where no expression was observed.

GENE STRUCTURE

Seranski et al. (2001) determined that the RAI1 gene contains 8 exons
and spans about 20 kb.

Toulouse et al. (2003) presented evidence that the RAI1 gene contains
only 6 exons. In their model, the 5-prime untranslated region is encoded
by 3 exons, and a significant CpG stretch is just upstream of exons 1
and 2. The promoter region contains binding sites for several regulatory
proteins, including a retinoic acid-responsive element.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Seranski et al. (1999) and Toulouse et al.
(2003) mapped the RAI1 gene to chromosome 17p11.2, within the
Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS; 182290) critical region.

Walz et al. (2004) stated that the mouse Rai1 gene maps to a region of
chromosome 11 that is syntenic with human chromosome 17p11.2.

GENE FUNCTION

Using quantitative real-time PCR, Williams et al. (2012) found that
knockdown of RAI1 via small interfering RNA in HEK293T cells reduced
expression of CLOCK (601851), a transcription factor that
heterodimerizes with BMAL1 (ARNTL; 602550) to activate genes of the
circadian feedback loop. Several CLOCK target genes and other components
of the circadian feedback loop also showed dysregulation following
knockdown of RAI1. Knockdown of RAI1 in U2OS-B cells reduced the
circadian period length, as measured by BMAL1 expression. Human
fibroblasts carrying a common SMS deletion, an atypical SMS deletion, or
an RAI1 missense mutation (Q1562R; 607642.0005) exhibited dysregulated
expression of core circadian genes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation,
microarray analysis, and reporter gene assays revealed a functional
RAI1-binding element in intron 1 of the CLOCK gene. Williams et al.
(2012) concluded that RAI1 is a major positive regulator of CLOCK gene
expression and is a circadian regulator.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Smith-Magenis Syndrome

By FISH, Seranski et al. (1999) determined that the RAI1 gene is deleted
in SMS. Seranski et al. (2001) confirmed heterozygous deletion of the
RAI1 gene in all SMS patients analyzed. The CAG repeats of 13 SMS
patients were sequenced, but no expansions, frameshifts, or point
mutations were detected. In normal individuals and SMS patients, 5
different RAI1 alleles were detected by gel electrophoresis, and
sequence analysis showed that the CAG repeats ranged in size from 36 to
42 bp.

Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) is a mental retardation syndrome usually
associated with deletions involving 17p11.2. Affected persons have
characteristic behavioral abnormalities, including self-injurious
behaviors and sleep disturbance, and distinct craniofacial and skeletal
anomalies. Slager et al. (2003) identified dominant frameshift mutations
(607642.0001-607642.0003) leading to protein truncation in the RAI1
protein in 3 individuals who had phenotypic features consistent with SMS
but did not have 17p11.2 deletions detectable by standard fluorescence
in situ hybridization techniques. They suggested that SMS may be similar
to previously described microdeletion syndromes in which a single gene
is implicated in most of the features but other deleted genes may modify
the overall phenotype. Haploinsufficiency of RAI1 is probably
responsible for the behavioral, neurologic, otolaryngologic, and
craniofacial features of the syndrome, but more variable features such
as heart and renal defects are probably due to hemizygosity of other
genes in the 17p11.2 region.

Bi et al. (2004) reported 2 novel RAI1 mutations, 1 frameshift and 1
nonsense mutation, in 2 SMS patients without FISH-detectable deletions.
Comparisons of the clinical features of these 2 patients, 3 of the
previously reported RAI1 point mutation cases, and the patients with a
common deletion suggested that most of the clinical features in SMS
result from RAI1 mutation, although phenotypic variability exists even
among individuals with RAI1 point mutations. Bioinformatics analyses of
RAI1 and comparative genomics between human and mouse orthologs revealed
a zinc finger-like plant homeodomain (PHD) at the C terminus that is
conserved in the trithorax group of chromatin-based transcription
regulators. These findings suggested that RAI1 is involved in
transcriptional control through a multiprotein complex whose function
may be altered in individuals with SMS.

Girirajan et al. (2005) performed mutation analysis of the RAI1 gene in
4 individuals with features consistent with SMS and without 17p11.2
deletions. Two patients were found to have small deletions in RAI1
resulting in frameshift and premature termination of the protein
(607642.0006 and 607642.0007, respectively). Missense mutations
(607642.0004 and 607642.0005, respectively) were identified in the other
2 patients. Orthologs across other genomes showed that these missense
mutations occurred in identically conserved regions of the gene. The
mutations were de novo. The patients' clinical features differed from
those found in 17p11.2 deletions by general absence of short stature and
lack of visceral anomalies. All 4 patients had developmental delay,
reduced motor and cognitive skills, craniofacial and behavioral
anomalies, and sleep disturbance. Seizures, not previously thought to be
associated with RAI1 mutations, were observed in 1 patient. Thus,
haploinsufficiency of the RAI1 gene is associated with most features of
SMS, including craniofacial, behavioral, and neurologic signs and
symptoms.

Bi et al. (2006) described 2 patients with SMS and point mutations in
the RAI1 gene. One was a 9-year-old boy who had a de novo 1-bp deletion
within a heptameric C-tract; the authors noted that of the 11 mutations
reported in patients with SMS, the 5 frameshifts due to single basepair
insertions or deletions all occurred within polyC tracts, and 2 were
within the same heptameric C-tract. The other patient was a 5-year-old
girl who was a compound heterozygote for a missense mutation inherited
from her unaffected father and an 18-copy CAG repeat inherited from her
mother, who had a history of ADHD. Her sister, who was obese and had
emotional problems, carried the missense mutation but not the large CAG
repeat; the missense mutation was not found in 120 ethnically matched
controls. Bi et al. (2006) suggested that the apparent SMS phenotype
observed in the female patient might result from the combination of the
rare nucleotide change and the relatively large CAG repeat.

Girirajan et al. (2006) reported the molecular and genotype-phenotype
analyses of 31 patients with SMS who carry 17p11.2 deletions or
intergenic mutations, respectively, and were compared for 30
characteristic features of the disorder by the Fisher exact test. Eight
of the 31 individuals carried a common 3.5-Mb deletion, whereas 10 of 31
individuals carried smaller deletions, 2 individuals carried larger
deletions, and 1 individual carried an atypical 17p11.2 deletion. Ten
patients with nondeletion harbored a heterozygous mutation in RAI1.
Phenotype comparison between patients with deletions and patients with
RAI1 mutations showed that 21 of 30 SMS features are the result of
haploinsufficiency of RAI1, whereas cardiac anomalies, speech and motor
delay, hypotonia, short stature, and hearing loss are associated with
17p11.2 deletions rather than RAI1 mutations (P less than 0.05).
Further, patients with smaller deletions show features similar to those
with RAI1 mutations. Girirajan et al. (2006) concluded that although
RAI1 is the primary gene responsible for most features of SMS, other
genes within 17p11.2 contribute to the variable features and overall
severity of the syndrome.

- Spinocerebellar Ataxia 2

Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2; 183090) is an autosomal dominant
disorder caused by the expansion of a polymorphic (CAG)n tract, which is
translated into an expanded polyglutamine tract in the ataxin-2 protein
(ATX2; 601517). Although repeat length and age at disease onset are
inversely related, approximately 50% of the age at onset variance in
SCA2 remained unexplained. Part of the remaining variance in
polyglutamine disorders may be due to other familial factors. The
ability of polyglutamine tracts to interact with each other, as well as
the presence of intranuclear inclusions in other polyglutamine
disorders, led Hayes et al. (2000) to hypothesize that other
CAG-containing proteins may interact with expanded ataxin-2 and affect
the rate of protein accumulation, and thus influence age at onset. To
test this hypothesis, they used step-wise multiple linear regression to
examine 10 CAG-containing genes for possible influences on SCA2 age at
onset. They found that the RAI1 locus contributed an additional 4.1% of
the variance in SCA2 age at onset after accounting for the effect of the
SCA2 expanded repeat. No such effect was observed in the case of SCA3
(109150). The result implicated RAI1 as a possible contributor to SCA2
neurodegeneration and raised the possibility that other CAG-containing
proteins may play a role in the pathogenesis of various polyglutamine
disorders.

Joober et al. (1999) identified a CAG repeat polymorphism that was
associated with the severity of schizophrenia (181500) and patient
response to neuroleptic medication. They found that schizophrenic
patients who were able to respond to neuroleptic medication displayed a
significantly shorter CAG repeat compared to controls. Nonresponders did
not differ from controls.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using retrovirus-mediated chromosome engineering to create nested
deletions of the mouse homolog to the SMS critical region, Yan et al.
(2004) constructed 3 lines of mice with 590- or 595-kb deletions,
Df(11)17-1, Df(11)17-2, and Df(11)17-3. Both craniofacial abnormalities
and obesity were observed, but the penetrance of the craniofacial
phenotype was markedly reduced when compared with Df(11)17 mice, which
have a 2-Mb deletion. The authors proposed that the loss of Rai1 may be
responsible for the craniofacial abnormalities and obesity.

Bi et al. (2005) generated a null RAI1 allele in mice. Obesity and
craniofacial abnormalities were observed in Rai1 +/- mice, but the
penetrance of craniofacial anomalies was further reduced in Rai1 +/-
mice compared with Df(11)17-1 or Df(11)17 mice. Most Rai1 -/- mice died
during gastrulation and organogenesis, and survivors were growth
retarded and displayed malformations in both the craniofacial and the
axial skeleton. Using Rai1-fusion constructs, the authors showed that
Rai1 is translocated to the nucleus and has transactivation activity. Bi
et al. (2005) concluded that Rai1 functions as a transcriptional
regulator and may be important for embryonic and postnatal development.

Walz et al. (2004) found that heterozygous Df(11)17 mice displayed an
average circadian period that was significantly shorter than that of
wildtype littermates.

Mice with a heterozygous duplication, Dp(11)17, of the region on mouse
chromosome 11 that is syntenic to human chromosome 17 are underweight
and show behavioral anomalies such as impaired contextual fear
conditioning (Walz et al., 2003, 2004). Walz et al. (2006) generated
compound heterozygous mice with a Dp(11)17 allele and a null Rai1
allele, thus resulting in normal disomic gene dosage of Rai1. Normal
Rai1 dosage rescued many of the phenotypes observed in heterozygous
Dp(11)17 mice, who have 3 copies of the gene, including normalization of
body weight and partial normalization of behavior. The phenotype was
rescued despite altered trisomic copy number of the other 18 or so genes
in the region. Walz et al. (2006) concluded that duplication of Rai1 is
responsible for decreased body weight in Dp(11)17 mice and that Rai1 is
a dosage-sensitive gene involved in body weight control and complex
behavioral responses.

Girirajan et al. (2008) generated transgenic mice with 4 and 6 copies of
the Rai1 gene. The mice showed growth retardation, increased locomotor
activity, impaired sensorimotor activity, and abnormal anxiety-related
behavior compared to wildtype littermates. Rai1-transgenic mice had an
altered gait, decreased forelimb grip strength, and a dominant social
behavior. There was a dose-dependent exacerbation of the phenotype,
including extreme growth retardation, severe neurologic deficits, and
increased hyperactivity in mice with higher Rai1 expression. Girirajan
et al. (2008) concluded that Rai1 dosage has major consequences on
molecular processes involved in growth, development, and neurologic and
behavioral functions, providing evidence for several dosage-thresholds
for phenotypic manifestations in humans.

Using quantitative real-time PCR, Williams et al. (2012) found that Rai1
+/- mouse hypothalamus showed dysregulated expression of Clock and other
circadian genes during light and dark phases.

underlying a serine-to-asparagine change at amino acid 1808 (S1808N).

SMITH-MAGENIS SYNDROME
RAI1, GLN1562ARG

In an 11-year-old white girl with mental retardation, progressive speech
delay, stereotypic behavior, intractable complex seizures, and facial
dysmorphism consistent with a diagnosis of Smith-Magenis syndrome
(182290), Girirajan et al. (2005) described a missense mutation in the
RAI1 protein, gln1562 to arg (Q1562R), resulting from a heterozygous
adenine-to-guanine transition at nucleotide 4685.

Using quantitative real-time PCR, Williams et al. (2012) showed that
fibroblasts carrying the Q1562R mutation showed dysregulated expression
of genes required for circadian rhythmicity.

RAI1, 1-BP DEL, 3801C

In a 14-year-old boy of European descent with features considered
consistent with SMS (182290), Girirajan et al. (2005) found a 1-bp
deletion in the RAI1 gene, 3801delC, in heterozygous state. The deletion
resulted in a frameshift starting at amino acid 1267, leading to
misincorporation of 46 amino acids and a downstream stop codon.

SMITH-MAGENIS SYNDROME
RAI1, 19-BP DEL

Girirajan et al. (2005) found that a 19-year-old woman of European
descent with features consistent with SMS (182290) had a 19-bp deletion
in the RAI1 gene (253del19).

608933	TITLE *608933 ENDONUCLEASE VIII-LIKE 2; NEIL2
;;NEI2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NEIL2 belongs to a class of DNA glycosylases homologous to the bacterial
Fpg/Nei family. These glycosylases initiate the first step in base
excision repair by cleaving bases damaged by reactive oxygen species and
introducing a DNA strand break via the associated lyase reaction
(Bandaru et al., 2002)

CLONING

By searching a database for sequences similar to the Arabidopsis DNA
glycosylase Fpg, Bandaru et al. (2002) identified NEIL2. Bacterial
Fpg/Nei proteins contain 2 structural domains: an N-terminal 2-layered
beta sandwich and a C-terminal 4-helix bundle, which includes a
helix-2-turns-helix (H2TH) motif and a zinc finger. The deduced
332-amino acid human NEIL2 protein has conserved residues in 6 highly
conserved regions that span both structural domains of the bacterial
Fpg/Nei proteins, but it has an unusual CHCC zinc finger.

Using Northern blot analysis, Hazra et al. (2002) detected a 2.4-kb
NEIL2 transcript. Expression was highest in skeletal muscle and testis,
moderate in brain and heart, and low in all other tissues examined.
Analysis of NEIL2 expression in synchronized human diploid fibroblasts
indicated that, unlike expression of NEIL1 (608844), expression of NEIL2
is independent of the cell cycle. Epitope-tagged NEIL2 was expressed in
nuclei of transfected cells, although a small fraction was also observed
in the cytoplasm. The deduced NEIL2 protein has a calculated molecular
mass of 36.7 kD, but bacterially-expressed NEIL2 showed an apparent
molecular mass of 42 kD by SDS-PAGE.

GENE FUNCTION

Hazra et al. (2002) characterized recombinant NEIL2 following expression
in E. coli. The enzyme showed DNA glycosylase/abasic lyase activity,
primarily for excising oxidative products of cytosine, with highest
activity for 5-hydroxyuracil. NEIL2 showed lower activity for
5,6-dihydrouracil and 5-hydroxycytosine, and negligible or undetectable
activity with 8-oxoguanine, thymine glycol, 2-hydroxyadenine,
hypoxanthine, and xanthine. Hazra et al. (2002) concluded that NEIL2 is
involved in global genome repair, mainly for removing oxidative products
of cytosine.

Dou et al. (2003) found that both NEIL2 and NEIL1 bound 5-hydroxyuracil
contained within bubble DNA, contrasting strongly with NTH1 (602656) and
OGG1 (601982), which did not produce stable complexes with either
single-strand DNA or a DNA bubble. NEIL2 had much higher activity for
excising 5-hydroxyuracil in bubble DNA than with duplex or single-strand
DNA. NEIL2 could also excise 8-oxoguanine when it was placed inside a
bubble.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bandaru et al. (2002) determined that the NEIL2 gene contains 4 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Bandaru et al. (2002) mapped the NEIL2
gene to chromosome 8p23.1.

603409	TITLE *603409 FRIZZLED, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 6; FZD6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Planar cell polarity (PCP) is the term given to global cell
polarization, such as the alignment of mammalian body hair along the
anterior-posterior axis or the orientation of stereocilia bundles in the
inner ear. FZD6 is a PCP protein that is involved in the transmission of
directional cues to align either individual cells within an epithelial
sheet or multicellular clusters, which polarize as a group (Devenport
and Fuchs, 2008).

CLONING

Members of the 'frizzled' (Fz) family (see 606143) are receptors for Wnt
family members (see 164975), secreted glycoproteins implicated in
development as well as in carcinogenesis. By PCR of a gastric cancer
cDNA pool with primers derived from the mouse Mfz6 cDNA, Tokuhara et al.
(1998) isolated a partial cDNA encoding the human Mfz6 homolog, FZD6.
They screened a fetal lung library with the partial cDNA and recovered
cDNAs corresponding to the entire FZD6 coding region. The predicted
706-amino acid FZD6 protein contains a signal peptide, a cysteine-rich
domain in the N-terminal extracellular region, and 7 transmembrane
domains. However, unlike many other Fz family members, FDZ6 does not
contain a C-terminal PDZ domain-binding motif. The FZD6 and Mfz6
proteins are 83% identical. Northern blot analysis revealed that FZD6 is
expressed as a 4.4-kb mRNA in various human tissues and cell lines.

In mice, Frojmark et al. (2011) observed transient Fzd6 mRNA expression
at the tip of the digits around embryonic day 16.5, supporting a role
for FZD6 in nail development. Microscopy showed that the transient Fzd6
mRNA expression was mainly confined to the epidermis of the digital tips
in a region corresponding to the developing nail bed and the ventral
part of the digit.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Tokuhara et al. (1998) mapped the
FZD6 gene to 8q22.3-q23.1. Mouse Mfz6 is located on chromosome 15.

GENE FUNCTION

Hair whorls (139400) and other macroscopic hair patterns are found in a
variety of mammalian species, including humans. Guo et al. (2004) showed
that the frizzled-6 gene controls macroscopic hair patterning in the
mouse. They found that Mfz6 is expressed in the skin and hair follicles
and that targeted deletion of the Mfz6 gene produced stereotyped whorls
on the hind feet, variable whorls and tufts on the head, and
misorientation of hairs on the torso. Embryo chimera experiments implied
that Mfz6 acts locally to control or propagate the macroscopic hair
pattern and that epithelial cells rather than melanocytes are the source
of Mfz6-dependent signaling. The Mfz6 phenotype strongly resembled the
wing-hair and bristle patterning defects observed in Drosophila
'frizzled' mutants. These data implied that hair patterning in mammals
uses a FZD6-dependent tissue polarity system similar to the one that
patterns the Drosophila cuticle.

Devenport and Fuchs (2008) found that marked changes in cell shape and
cytoskeletal polarization occurred in embryonic mouse skin as nascent
hair follicles became anteriorly angled, morphologically polarized, and
molecularly compartmentalized along the anterior-posterior axis. Using
embryonic mice harboring point mutations in Vangl2 (600533) and Celsr1
(604523), they showed that these proteins were asymmetrically
distributed within the embryonic epidermal basal layer, were codependent
for their asymmetric distribution, and drove the orientation of hair
follicles along the anterior-posterior axis. Fzd6 was also required for
the orientation of adult hair follicles. Fzd6 asymmetrically localized
in the epidermis and was recruited to cell contacts by Celsr1. Devenport
and Fuchs (2008) concluded that PCP proteins operate early in the
mammalian epidermis to coordinately polarize hair follicles across body
axes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 unrelated consanguineous Pakistani families segregating autosomal
recessive isolated congenital nail dysplasia mapping to 8q (NDNC10;
614157), Frojmark et al. (2011) analyzed the candidate gene FZD6 and
identified homozygosity for a nonsense (603409.0001) and a missense
(603409.0002) mutation in affected members of each family, respectively.
Both mutations result in alterations of the intracellular tail.

ANIMAL MODEL

Frojmark et al. (2011) studied Fzd6 -/- mice and observed that about 50%
of male, but not female, mutant mice displayed abnormal claw morphology
or absent claws compared to wildtype mice. At the age of 2 to 3 months,
the claws disappeared or became rudimentary on the hind limbs.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
NAIL DISORDER, NONSYNDROMIC CONGENITAL, 10
FZD6, GLU584TER

In 3 affected sibs and their affected second cousin from a
consanguineous Pakistani family with isolated congenital nail dysplasia
(NDNC10; 614157), Frojmark et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for a
1750G-T transversion in the FZD6 gene, resulting in a glu584-to-ter
(E584X) substitution in the intracellular domain. Affected individuals
in this family displayed markedly thickened, claw-like fingernails in
addition to dysplastic toenails. The unaffected parents were
heterozygous for the mutation, and unaffected sibs were either
homozygous for wildtype or heterozygous for the mutation, which was not
found in 94 unrelated Pakistani controls or 110 Swedish blood donors.
Patient fibroblasts expressed FZD6 mRNA at levels that were 13% of
wildtype, and functional analysis showed an aberrant response to both
WNT3A (606359) and WNT5A (164975) signaling.

FZD6, ARG511CYS

In 4 affected individuals from a large consanguineous Pakistani pedigree
with isolated congenital nail dysplasia (NDNC10; 614157), Frojmark et
al. (2011) identified homozygosity for a 1531C-T transition in the FZD6
gene, resulting in an arg511-to-cys (R511C) substitution at a conserved
residue in the intracellular domain near the highly conserved
PDZ-binding motif. The unaffected parents were heterozygous for the
mutation, and unaffected sibs were either homozygous for wildtype or
heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found in 94 unrelated
Pakistani controls or 110 Swedish blood donors. Analysis in HEK293T
cells demonstrated a quantitative shift in subcellular distribution of
the mutant protein from the plasma membrane to the lysosomes compared to
wildtype.

DESCRIPTION See 132880. Chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factors
(COUP-TFs) are members of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor
superfamily. They are referred to as orphan receptors because no ligand
has yet been identified for them. Qiu et al. (1995) noted that, like
other members of the family, COUP-TFs contain a DNA-binding domain and a
putative ligand-binding domain. They are also response elements for
several other members of the superfamily, namely, the vitamin D receptor
(277440), the thyroid hormone receptor (see 190120), the retinoic acid
receptor (see RARA; 180240), and the retinoid X receptor (see 180245).
COUP-TFs are expressed in many tissues and in various cell lines.
Furthermore, in situ hybridization experiments demonstrated that
COUP-TFs are highly expressed during mouse embryonic development. Their
expression patterns are spatially and temporally regulated, suggesting
that COUP-TFs may be involved in organogenesis. Two COUP-TF genes have
been cloned in the human: COUP-TFI, also referred to as EAR3 and NR2F1,
and COUP-TFII, also called ARP1 (107773). To determine whether the
genomic organization is conserved between human and mouse, Qiu et al.
(1995) isolated these 2 genes in the mouse and characterized their
structure. Both genes have relatively simple structures that are similar
to those of their human counterparts. In addition, they mapped the mouse
COUP-TFI to the distal region of chromosome 13 and the COUP-TFII to the
central region of chromosome 7. Furthermore, they mapped human COUP-TFI
to 5q14 and COUP-TFII to 15q26 (where the gene designated ARP1 had been
previously localized). The human chromosomal localization was achieved
by isotopic in situ hybridization; the murine assignments by
interspecific backcross analysis.

612564	TITLE *612564 THIOREDOXIN DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 9; TXNDC9
;;PHOSDUCIN-LIKE PROTEIN 3; PHLP3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Stirling et al. (2006) stated that the human TXNDC9 gene, which they
called PHLP3, encodes a 226-amino acid protein with a helical N
terminus, a central thioredoxin (TXN; 187700) domain, and an acidic C
terminus.

GENE FUNCTION

Using coimmunoprecipitation analysis and pull-down assays, Stirling et
al. (2006) showed that human PHLP3 interacted with the chaperonin
containing TCP1 (CCT) complex (see 605139). Mutation analysis revealed
that both the N- and C-terminal domains of PHLP3 were required for the
interaction. PHLP3 formed a ternary complex with CCT and either
denatured actin (see 102560) or tubulin (see 602529) and inhibited their
folding. PHLP3 did not compete with the denatured substrates and had no
effect on the basal ATPase activity of CCT, but it slowed the ATPase
activity of CCT in the presence of substrates. In vivo, the yeast PHLP3
homolog appeared to coordinate the proper biogenesis of actin and
tubulin with prefoldin (see 604897), a chaperone that facilitates
CCT-mediated actin and tubulin folding.

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the TXNDC9 gene to chromosome 2q11.2 based on an
alignment of the TXNDC9 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC022864) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

detected expression of Pp2c-eta in all mouse tissues examined. Strongest
expression was in testis, followed by lung, kidney, brain, heart, and
liver. Pp2c-eta localized mainly to the nucleus of transfected cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Komaki et al. (2003) found that recombinant mouse Pp2c-eta expressed in
E. coli exhibited Mn(2+)-dependent protein phosphatase activity against
a test substrate.

605513	TITLE *605513 MELAN A; MLANA
;;MELANOMA ANTIGEN RECOGNIZED BY T CELLS 1; MART1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Antitumor cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTLs) or tumor-infiltrating
lymphocytes (TILs) restricted by HLA-A2 can be raised from patients and
are capable of lysing HLA-A2 melanomas. One of the antigens recognized
by these CTLs, SK29-Ab, is encoded by the tyrosinase gene (TYR; 606933),
while another, SK29-Aa, is encoded by the melan A gene (MLANA). By cDNA
expression cloning, screening with TILs, and PCR, Kawakami et al. (1994)
isolated cDNAs encoding gp100 (SILV; 155550) and MLANA, which they
called MART1. Sequence analysis predicted that the 118-amino acid MLANA
protein contains no leader sequence but has a putative transmembrane
hydrophobic stretch, which may bind HLA-A2, followed by 3 arg residues.
Northern blot analysis revealed high expression in melanomas and lower
expression in melanocytes. MLANA was expressed in retina but not in
other normal tissues or B- and T-cell lines. Kawakami et al. (1994)
noted that vitiligo, presumed to result from antimelanocyte reactions,
is associated with a favorable prognosis in melanoma without untoward
ophthalmologic effects.

By transfecting a cDNA library into COS cells with plasmids containing
an SV40 origin of replication, followed by CTL screening, Coulie et al.
(1994) obtained a cDNA encoding MLANA. They noted that in addition to
the hydrophobic stretch, the MLANA protein is rich in proline. Northern
blot analysis detected a 0.75-kb MLANA transcript in a melanoma line.
RT-PCR analysis showed that all melanoma tumor samples tested expressed
MLANA, as did most melanoma cell lines and melanocytes; expression was
not detected in all other normal tissues tested.

GENE FUNCTION

Hoashi et al. (2005) used a multidisciplinary approach, including
immunofluorescence, studies of pigmented and nonpigmented melanoma cell
lines, and small interfering RNAs (siRNA), to show that MART1 interacts
with SILV, which they called Pmel17, in melanogenesis. MART1 regulated
the expression, stability, trafficking, and processing of Pmel17. MART1
colocalized and formed a complex with the P100 form of Pmel17 within
early subcellular compartments in melanocytic cells. MART1 siRNA reduced
Pmel17 expression, abrogated the processing of Pmel17 in post-Golgi
compartments, and interrupted trafficking of Pmel17 to early
melanosomes. Hoashi et al. (2005) concluded that MART1 is indispensable
for Pmel17 function and plays an important role in regulating mammalian
pigmentation.

Giordano et al. (2009) showed that GPR143 (300808) interacted
biochemically with the premelanosomal protein MART1. Inactivation of
MART1 by siRNA led to decreased stability of GPR143 and was accompanied
by defects in premelanosome biogenesis and composition similar to that
caused of GPR143 loss of function. Giordano et al. (2009) concluded that
melanosome composition and identity are regulated at early stages by
GPR143 and that MART1 likely acts as an escort protein for GPR143.

GENE STRUCTURE

Coulie et al. (1994) determined that the MLANA gene contains 5 exons and
spans approximately 18.5 kb.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Consortium mapped the MLANA gene to
chromosome 9 (TMAP stSG28260).

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

KAT5 belongs to the MYST protein family. MYST proteins contain an
approximately 300-amino acid domain that includes atypical zinc finger
and histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domains. KAT5 also contains a
chromodomain. KAT5 has been implicated in various cellular activities,
including DNA repair, apoptosis, and transcriptional regulation (summary
by Hu et al., 2009).

CLONING

Kamine et al. (1996) used a 2-hybrid cloning system in yeast to identify
a partial human B-lymphoblastoid cDNA encoding TIP60, a polypeptide that
interacts specifically with the N-terminal 31 amino acids of HIV-1 Tat,
the region which contains the essential cysteine-rich portion of the Tat
activation domain. The TIP60 polypeptide encoded by the partial cDNA
also bound to purified Tat in vitro. By screening activated human T- and
B-cell lines, Kamine et al. (1996) identified full-length TIP60. The
deduced 383-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 44 kD.
TIP60 shares significant similarity with yeast Sas2, which is thought to
function in gene silencing. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.9-kb
transcript in human monocyte, T-lymphocyte, and HeLa cell lines.

Reifsnyder et al. (1996) described the yeast Sas2 gene, which encodes a
protein important to transcriptional silencing and exit from the cell
cycle. By database analysis, they found that the human sequences most
closely related to yeast Sas2 are those of MOZ (601408) and TIP60.

By 5-prime and 3-prime RACE of a heart cDNA library, Ran and
Pereira-Smith (2000) obtained 2 TIP60 splice variants that they called
TIP60-alpha and TIP60-beta. TIP60-alpha uses all TIP60 exons and encodes
a deduced 513-amino acid protein. TIP50-beta skips exon 5 and encodes a
deduced 461-amino acid protein that lacks 52 amino acids near the N
terminus, including a proline-rich region. RT-PCR analysis detected
variable expression of both transcripts in human heart, kidney, and
brain and in human cell lines and normal fibroblasts.
Immunohistochemical analysis showed that both TIP60-alpha and TIP60-beta
localized to the nucleus in a speckled pattern, with exclusion from the
nucleolus. TIP60-beta was also detected in the cytoplasm. EST database
analysis suggested that both variants are also expressed in mouse.

Using a yeast interaction trap 2-hybrid screen, Sheridan et al. (2001)
independently identified the TIP60-beta isoform, which they called PLIP
(phospholipase-interacting protein), through its interaction with a
group IV cytosolic phospholipase A2, cPLA2 (see PLA2G4A; 600522).
Sheridan et al. (2001) determined that both TIP60 proteins contain a
MYST domain, homologous to those of Sas2 and MOZ, that includes a HAT
domain and a C2HC zinc finger domain. Both TIP60 proteins also have 2
potential ERK1 (MAPK3; 601795)/ERK2 (MAPK1; 176948) kinase
phosphorylation sites and a potential cyclin-dependent kinase
phosphorylation site. By Western blot analysis, Sheridan et al. (2001)
identified bands at 60 kD and 50 kD, representing both isoforms, in
several cell lines, including some of human origin.

By EST database analysis and RT-PCR of HeLa cell mRNA, Legube and
Trouche (2003) cloned a splice variant of TIP60 that retains intron 1.
The deduced 546-amino acid protein has a 33-amino acid N-terminal
insertion prior to the chromodomain. PCR analysis detected transcripts
with intron 1 in HeLa cells, Jurkat human T cells, and mouse NIH-3T3
fibroblasts. ESTs for the long TIP60 variant were detected in mouse and
bovine databases. The nucleotide sequence of intron 1 is highly
conserved in mouse and human, and the predicted amino acid sequences
differ by only 1 residue. The presence of the extra amino acids from
intron 1 did not affect phosphorylation or stability of human TIP60.

GENE FUNCTION

Kamine et al. (1996) found that mutation of essential cysteine residues
in Tat abolished interaction with TIP60. Transient overexpression of
full-length TIP60 resulted in a 4-fold augmentation of Tat
transactivation of the HIV-1 promoter without increasing the basal
activity of the HIV promoter or activating the heterologous RSV
promoter. Kamine et al. (1996) suggested that TIP60 might be a cofactor
of Tat involved in the regulation of HIV gene expression.

Yamamoto and Horikoshi (1997) demonstrated that the purified recombinant
MYST domain of HTATIP had HAT activity, using as substrates H2A (see
613499), H3 (see 602810), and H4 (see 602822), but not H2B (see 609904),
in core histone mixtures.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Brady et al. (1999) determined that the
ligand-binding domain of androgen receptor (AR; 313700) interacted with
human brain TIP60. The interaction was not ligand dependent, but binding
was enhanced in the presence of dihydrotestosterone. TIP60 contained no
intrinsic transcriptional activity, but it enhanced AR-mediated
transactivation of a reporter gene in transfected cells in a
ligand-dependent manner. TIP60 also enhanced transactivation mediated by
progesterone receptor (PGR; 607311) and estrogen receptor (see ESR1;
133430) in a ligand-dependent manner.

Ikura et al. (2000) showed that ectopic expression of mutated HTATIP
lacking histone acetylase activity resulted in cells with defective
double-strand DNA break repair that lose apoptotic competence.

In transfection experiments, Sheridan et al. (2001) demonstrated that
both HTATIP and PLIP coimmunoprecipitated and colocalized with cPLA2.
Using serum withdrawal to induce growth arrest and apoptosis in mouse
renal mesangial cells, they found cytosolic to nuclear translocation of
endogenous complexes that correlated with onset of apoptosis. PLIP was
also found to potentiate apoptosis and prostaglandin production
following serum withdrawal.

Amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP; 104760), a widely expressed cell
surface protein, is cleaved in the transmembrane region by
gamma-secretase. Gamma-cleavage of APP produces the extracellular
amyloid beta peptide of Alzheimer disease (104300) and releases an
intracellular tail fragment. Cao and Sudhof (2001) demonstrated that the
cytoplasmic tail of APP forms a multimeric complex with the nuclear
adaptor protein Fe65 (602709) and the HAT TIP60. This complex potently
stimulated transcription via heterologous Gal4 or LexA DNA binding
domains, suggesting that release of the cytoplasmic tail of APP by
gamma-cleavage may function in gene expression.

Baek et al. (2002) demonstrated that interleukin-1-beta (IL1B; 147720)
causes nuclear export of a specific NCOR (600849) corepressor complex,
resulting in derepression of a specific subset of nuclear factor-kappa-B
(NFKB; see 164011)-regulated genes. These genes are exemplified by the
tetraspanin KAI1 (600623), which regulates membrane receptor function.
Nuclear export of the NCOR/TAB2 (605101)/HDAC3 (605166) complex by IL1B
is temporally linked to selective recruitment of a TIP60 coactivator
complex. KAI1 is also directly activated by a ternary complex, dependent
on the acetyltransferase activity of TIP60, that consists of the
presenilin-dependent C-terminal cleavage product of APP, FE65, and
TIP60, identifying a specific in vivo gene target of an APP-dependent
transcription complex in the brain.

Kim et al. (2005) reported that the downregulation of a metastasis
suppressor gene, KAI1, in prostate cancer cells involves the inhibitory
actions of beta-catenin (116806), along with a reptin (TIP48, or RUVBL2;
604788) chromatin remodeling complex. The coordinated actions of
beta-catenin-reptin components that mediate the repressive state serve
to antagonize a TIP60 coactivator complex that is required for
activation; the balance of these opposing complexes controls the
expression of KAI1 and metastatic potential. The molecular mechanisms
underlying the antagonistic regulation of beta-catenin-reptin and the
TIP60 coactivator complexes for the metastasis suppressor gene, KAI1,
are likely to be prototypic of a selective downregulation strategy for
many genes, including a subset of NF-kappa-B (see 164011) target genes.

ATM (607585) regulates the cellular response to DNA damage through
phosphorylation of proteins involved in cell cycle checkpoints and DNA
repair. Sun et al. (2005) determined that DNA damage in HeLa cells
induced rapid acetylation of ATM that was dependent on TIP60.
Suppression of TIP60 blocked activation of ATM kinase activity and
prevented ATM-dependent phosphorylation of p53 (TP53; 191170) and CHK2
(CHEK2; 604373). Furthermore, inactivation of TIP60 sensitized cells to
ionizing radiation. ATM formed a stable complex with TIP60, and DNA
damage activated the HAT activity of the ATM-TIP60 complex. Activation
of TIP60 by DNA damage and recruitment of the ATM-TIP60 complex to sites
of DNA damage were independent of ATM kinase activity.

Tang et al. (2006) found that K120 within the DNA-binding domain of p53
was acetylated in several human cell lines, and acetylation of K120 was
significantly enhanced upon DNA damage. This modification of p53 was
catalyzed by TIP60. A tumor-derived p53 mutant, K120R, which is
defective for TIP60-mediated acetylation, abrogated p53-dependent
activation of apoptosis but had no significant effect on cell growth
arrest.

Sykes et al. (2006) showed that the p53 K120R mutation selectively
blocked transcription of proapoptotic target genes such as BAX (600040)
and PUMA (605854). Depletion of TIP60 or MOF (MYST1; 609912), another
enzyme that can acetylate p53 at K120, inhibited the ability of p53 to
activate BAX and PUMA transcription. Sykes et al. (2006) further showed
that acetyl-K120 form of p53 specifically accumulated at proapoptotic
target genes.

Spinocerebellar ataxia-1 (SCA1; 164400) is a neurodegenerative disease
caused by expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat encoding a
polyglutamine stretch in ataxin-1 (ATXN1; 601556). Using a conditional
transgenic mouse model of SCA1, Serra et al. (2006) showed that delaying
postnatal expression of mutant human ATXN1 until completion of
cerebellar maturation led to a substantial reduction in disease severity
in adults compared with early postnatal expression of mutant ATXN1.
Microarray analysis revealed that genes regulated by Rora (600825), a
transcription factor critical for cerebellar development, were
downregulated at an early stage of disease in Purkinje cells of SCA1
transgenic mice. Rora mRNA and protein levels were reduced in Purkinje
cells of SCA1 transgenic mice, and the effect of mutant ATXN1 on Rora
protein levels appeared to be independent of its effect on Rora mRNA
levels. Partial loss of Rora enhanced the pathogenicity of mutant ATXN1
in transgenic mice. Coimmunoprecipitation and pull-down analyses
suggested the existence of a complex containing Atxn1, Rora, and the
Rora coactivator Tip60, with Atxn1 and Tip60 interacting directly. Serra
et al. (2006) concluded that RORA and TIP60 have a role in SCA1 and
proposed that their findings provide a mechanism by which compromised
cerebellar development contributes to the severity of neurodegeneration
in an adult.

By peptide analysis of nuclear proteins that interacted with CEBP-alpha
(CEBPA; 116897), Bararia et al. (2008) identified TIP60 as a CEBPA
binding partner. The interaction was confirmed by coprecipitation
analysis and protein pull-down assays. TIP60 enhanced the ability of
CEBPA to transactivate a TK (TK1; 188300) promoter containing 2 CCAAT
sites, and the HAT activity of TIP60 was required for its cooperativity
with CEBPA. Domain analysis revealed that TIP60 interacted with the
DNA-binding and transactivation domains of CEBPA. Immunoprecipitation
analysis showed that TIP60 was recruited to the promoters of CEBPA and
GCSFR (CSF3R; 138971) following beta-estradiol-induced differentiation
of K562 myelogenous leukemia cells, which was concomitant with histone
acetylation at the CEBPA and GCSFR promoters.

- NuA4/TIP60 Histone Acetyltransferase Complex

The NuA4 HAT complex is responsible for acetylation of the N-terminal
tails of histone H4 and H2A in yeast. Its catalytic subunit, Esa1, is
homologous to human TIP60. Using affinity purification, Western blot
analysis, cell fractionation, immunoprecipitation, and mass
spectrometry, Doyon et al. (2004) found that TIP60 and its splice
variant, TIP60B/PLIP, were part of a multisubunit NuA4 complex with HAT
activity in several human cell lines. They identified human homologs for
11 of the 12 yeast NuA4 subunits, TIP60, TRRAP (603015), domino (EP400;
606265), EPC1 (610999)/EPC2 (611000), DMAP1 (DNMAP1; 605077), ING3
(607493), BAF53A (ACTL6A; 604958), actin (see 102610), MRG15 (MORF4L1;
607303), GAS41 (YEATS4; 602116), and EAF6 (611001), as well as 3
subunits specific to the human NuA4 complex, RUVBL1 (603449), RUVBL2,
and BRD8 (602848). Doyon et al. (2004) showed that ING3 linked NuA4 to
p53 function in vivo. MRG15 and DMAP1 were also present in distinct
complexes harboring histone deacetylase and SWI2 (SMARCA2;
600014)-related ATPase activities, respectively. A recombinant trimeric
complex of TIP60, EPC1, and ING3 was sufficient to reconstitute
nucleosomal HAT activity in vitro. Doyon et al. (2004) concluded that
the NuA4 complex is conserved in eukaryotes and has primary roles in
transcription, cellular response to DNA damage, and cell cycle control.

Phosphorylation of the human histone variant H2AX (601772) and H2Av, its
homolog in Drosophila melanogaster, occurs rapidly at sites of DNA
double-strand breaks. Kusch et al. (2004) demonstrated that the
Drosophila Tip60 chromatin-remodeling complex acetylated nucleosomal
phospho-H2Av and exchanged it with an unmodified H2Av. Both the histone
acetyltransferase Tip60 as well as the ATPase Domino/p400 catalyzed the
exchange of phospho-H2Av. Thus, Kusch et al. (2004) concluded that their
data reveal a previously unknown mechanism for selective histone
exchange that uses the concerted action of 2 distinct
chromatin-remodeling enzymes within the same multiprotein complex.

Using RNA interference in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, Fazzio et al.
(2008) found that depletion of any of 7 components of the Tip60-p400 HAT
and nucleosome remodeling complex, including Tip60, caused the same
phenotype. Unlike normal ES cells, which grow in spherical 3-dimensional
colonies, ES cells depleted of any the 7 Tip60-p400 HAT components
showed a flattened and elongated morphology, with monolayer growth and
reduced cell-cell contacts. These knockdown cells continued to cycle,
with reduced cells in S phase and increased cells in G2 phase. The
effect of Tip60-p400 HAT component knockdown was unique to ES cells, as
negligible changes were observed following knockdown in mouse embryonic
fibroblasts. p400 localized to the promoters of both silent and active
genes in mouse ES cells, and this localization was dependent upon
histone H3 lys4 trimethylation (H3K4me3). Genes misregulated in ES cells
following knockdown of Tip60 or p400 were enriched for developmental
regulators and significantly overlapped with genes misregulated in ES
cells following knockdown of the transcription factor Nanog (607937).
Depletion of Nanog reduced p400 binding to target promoters without
affecting H3K4me3 levels. Fazzio et al. (2008) concluded that the
Tip60-p400 HAT complex integrates signals from Nanog and H3K4me3 to
regulate gene expression in ES cells.

Lin et al. (2012) reported that glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3;
606784), when deinhibited by default in cells deprived of growth
factors, activates acetyltransferase TIP60 through phosphorylating TIP60
serine at codon 86. This directly acetylates and stimulates the protein
kinase ULK1 (603168), which is required for autophagy. Cells engineered
to express TIP60(S86A) that cannot be phosphorylated by GSK3 could not
undergo serum deprivation-induced autophagy. An acetylation-defective
mutant of ULK1 failed to rescue autophagy in Ulk-null mouse embryonic
fibroblasts. Cells used signaling from GSK3 to TIP60 and ULK1 to
regulate autophagy when deprived of serum but not glucose. Lin et al.
(2012) concluded that their findings uncovered an activating pathway
that integrates protein phosphorylation and acetylation to connect
growth factor deprivation to autophagy.

Kaidi and Jackson (2013) demonstrated that tyrosine phosphorylation of
the protein acetyltransferase KAT5 increases after DNA damage in a
manner that promotes KAT5 binding to the histone mark H3K9me3. This
triggers KAT5-mediated acetylation of the ATM (607585) kinase, promoting
DNA damage checkpoint activation and cell survival. Kaidi and Jackson
(2013) also established that chromatin alterations can themselves
enhance KAT5 tyrosine pohsphorylation and ATM-dependent signaling, and
identified the protooncogene c-Abl (189980) as a mediator of this
modification. Kaidi and Jackson (2013) concluded that their findings
defined KAT5 tyrosine phosphroylation as a key event in the sensing of
genomic and chromatin perturbations, and highlighted a key role for
c-Abl in such processes.

- Role in Tumorigenesis

Gorrini et al. (2007) stated that the acetyltransferase Tip60 might
influence tumorigenesis in multiple ways. For example, Tip60 is a
coregulator of transcription factors that either promote or suppress
tumorigenesis, such as Myc (190080) and p53 (191170). Also, Tip60
modulates DNA-damage response (DDR) signaling, and a DDR triggered by
oncogenes can counteract tumor progression. Using Myc transgenic mice
that were heterozygous for a Tip60 gene knockout allele, Gorrini et al.
(2007) showed that Tip60 counteracts Myc-induced lymphomagenesis in a
haploinsufficient manner and in a time window that is restricted to a
pre- or early-tumor stage. Gorrini et al. (2007) further found that the
human TIP60 gene is a frequent target for monoallelic loss in human
lymphomas and head-and-neck and mammary carcinomas, with concomitant
reduction in mRNA levels. Immunohistochemical analysis also demonstrated
loss of nuclear TIP60 staining in mammary carcinomas. These events
correlated with disease grade and frequently concurred with mutation of
p53. Thus, in both mouse and human, TIP60 has a haploinsufficient tumor
suppressor activity that is independent from--but not contradictory
with--its role within the ARF-p53 pathway. Gorrini et al. (2007)
suggested that this is because critical levels of TIP60 are required for
mounting an oncogene-induced DDR in incipient tumor cells, the failure
of which might synergize with p53 mutation towards tumor progression.

GENE STRUCTURE

Independently, Ran and Pereira-Smith (2000) and Sheridan et al. (2001)
determined that the KAT5 gene contains 14 exons. Ran and Pereira-Smith
(2000) found that the KAT5 gene spans over 9 kb.

Kamine et al. (1996) reported that the promoter region of the KAT5 gene
lacks a TATA box, but that it has a number of consensus binding sites
for transcription factors, including SP1 (189906).

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Sheridan et al. (2001) mapped the KAT5
gene to chromosome 11q13.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hu et al. (2009) found that Tip60 +/- mice developed and reproduced
normally, but Tip60 -/- embryos died at the blastocyst-gastrula
transition.

;;PROTEIN INCORPORATED LATER INTO TIGHT JUNCTIONS; PILT;;
TIGHT JUNCTION PROTEIN 4; TJP4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of a mouse 11-day-old embryo library using
human DLG2 (603583) SH3 and GK domains as bait, Kawabe et al. (2001)
cloned mouse Tjap1, which they called Pilt. By database analysis, they
identified full-length human TJAP1, which encodes a 547-amino acid
protein with a calculated molecular mass of 60.7 kD. TJAP1 contains an
N-terminal coiled-coil domain and a central proline-rich region, and
shares 74% amino acid identity with its mouse homolog. TJAP1 shares 43%
and 51% amino acid identity over its N-terminal and C-terminal regions,
respectively, with the same regions of BEGAIN. SDS-PAGE detected TJAP1
as an 86-kD band. Northern blot analysis detected an approximately
3.0-kb transcript in all 16 human tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunofluorescence microscopy of mouse mammary tumor cells, Kawabe et
al. (2001) localized TJAP1 to cell-cell junctions where it colocalized
with ZO-1 (TJP1; 601009) at tight junctions. Using endogenous and stably
expressed TJAP1, the authors confirmed colocalization of TJAP1 and ZO-1
to tight junctions in small intestine cells where TJAP1 localized to the
Golgi complex. TJAP1 was absent from apical junctions and desmosomes. By
observing TJAP1 incorporation into cell-cell junctions over time in a
mouse wound healing model, the authors showed that TJAP1 was
incorporated into tight junctions at the very late stages of cell-cell
junction formation. Kawabe et al. (2001) used GST pull-down assays to
confirm that TJAP1 binds DLG2. Immunohistochemical studies using
cadherin deficient L-cells expressing claudin-1 (CLDN1; 603718) or JAM
(JAM1; 605721) showed no evidence of interaction between TJAP1 and
either of these 2 proteins.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database analysis, Feske et al. (2006) identified human ORAI1
(610277), ORAI2, and ORAI3 (610930) as homologs of a Drosophila gene,
Orai, that they identified through an RNA interference screen for
regulators of store-operated calcium entry and nuclear factor of
activated T cells (NFAT; see 600489) nuclear import. In Greek mythology,
the Orai are the keepers of the gates of heaven: Eunomia (Order or
Harmony), Dike (Justice), and Eirene (Peace).

GENE FUNCTION

Mercer et al. (2006) showed that coexpression of STIM1 (605921) with
ORAI2 augmented store-operated Ca(2+) entry to a lesser extent than
coexpression of STIM1 with ORAI1. Expression of ORAI2 or ORAI1 in the
absence of STIM1 inhibited Ca(2+) entry.

MAPPING

Feske et al. (2006) stated that the ORAI2 gene maps to chromosome 7.

;;HANGOVER, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF; HANG;;
FLJ38144
DESCRIPTION Scholz et al. (2005) described a novel gene in Drosophila melanogaster,
'Hangover' (Hang), that is required for normal development of ethanol
tolerance. Flies null for the Hang gene are also defective in responses
to environmental stressors such as heat and the free radical-generating
agent paraquat. Using genetic epistasis tests, Scholz et al. (2005)
showed that ethanol tolerance in Drosophila relies on 2 distinct
molecular pathways: a cellular stress pathway defined by Hang, and a
parallel pathway requiring octopamine, the Drosophila analog of
mammalian noradrenaline. The Hang gene encodes a large nuclear zinc
finger protein, suggesting a role in nucleic acid binding. The Hang gene
is expressed ubiquitously in the Drosophila nervous system, and Hang
protein is localized to the nuclei of neurons. Scholz et al. (2005)
concluded that the role of stress, at both the cellular and systemic
levels, in contributing to drug- and addiction-related behaviors in
mammals may be conserved across evolution.

608580	TITLE 608580 MYOSIN, HEAVY CHAIN 16, SKELETAL MUSCLE, PSEUDOGENE; MYH16
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The MYH16 gene, encoding a sarcomeric myosin heavy chain expressed in
nonhuman primate masticatory muscles, is inactivated in humans. Stedman
et al. (2004) hypothesized that the decrement in masticatory muscle size
caused by the inactivation of MYH16 removed an evolutionary constraint
on encephalization in early man.

CLONING

By screening genomic cosmid libraries for myosin heavy chain genes,
followed by cDNA hybridization and PCR amplification, Desjardins et al.
(2002) cloned MYH16.

Using degenerate PCR, Stedman et al. (2004) obtained a DNA sequence for
a human sarcomeric myosin gene, MYH16. They annotated the locus using
homology to other sarcomeric myosins and generated the complete
sequence.

GENE STRUCTURE

Stedman et al. (2004) found that the human MYH16 gene comprises 42 exons
and spans 67,983 basepairs.

GENE FUNCTION

Stedman et al. (2004) detected transcription of human MYH16 and its M.
fascicularis homolog only in muscles derived from the first pharyngeal
arch, denoted as masticatory muscles, including temporalis and tensor
veli palatini. No MYH16 protein is expressed in human. The relative size
of individual masticatory muscle homologs contrasts remarkably in gross
anatomic comparisons between humans and great apes and monkeys. At the
histologic level, the difference between human and nonhuman primate
temporalis muscle is highlighted by staining for type II (all
fast-twitch) sarcomeric myosin and interstitial laminin. Human type II
fibers are about one-eighth the size of those of M. fascicularis, while
unstained type I fibers are the same size in both species. Protein gel
electrophoresis and peptide sequencing using mass spectrometry showed
that the dominant heavy chain isoform in the temporalis of M.
fascicularis, specific to the masticatory muscles and undetectable in
human temporalis, is the product of the M. fascicularis MYH16 ortholog.
That MYH16 is still appropriately transcribed indicates that the coding
sequence deletion was not preceded by a silencing mutation in a
transcriptional control domain. Stedman et al. (2004) postulated that
the volume of the skeletal muscle fibers expressing the MYH16 gene
transcript is proportional to the total amount of myosin heavy chain
accumulating in the cell, and that reliance on the translation of the
less abundant MYH1 (160730) and MYH2 (160740) transcripts in the face of
a frameshift mutation in MYH16 resulted in the 8-fold reduction in the
size of the type II fibers in the human masticatory muscles as compared
with macaque. Using the coding sequence for the myosin rod domains as a
molecular clock, Stedman et al. (2004) estimated that this mutation
appeared approximately 2.4 million years ago, predating the appearance
of modern human body size and emigration of Homo from Africa. Stedman et
al. (2004) hypothesized that this smaller muscle size led to
gracilization of facial bones and accelerated encephalization in early
Homo.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Stedman et al. (2004) identified a frameshift deletion at codon 660 in
all modern human samples, including natives of Africa, South America,
western Europe, Iceland, Japan, and Russia; thus, the inactivating
mutation seems to be fixed in Homo sapiens. In contrast, all of the
nonhuman primates for which sequence was obtained, including woolly
monkey, pigtail macaque, rhesus, orangutan, gorilla, bonobo, and
chimpanzee, have an ACC codon that encodes a highly conserved threonine.
The frameshift in the human coding sequence truncates the predicted
224-kD myosin heavy chain to a 76-kD fragment containing an unstable
portion of the myosin head domain.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Desjardins et al. (2002) mapped the MYH16
gene to chromosome 7.

By analysis of genomic sequence, Stedman et al. (2004) determined that
the human MYH16 gene resides in the region of human chromosome 7q22
flanked 5-prime by SMURF1 (605568) and 3-prime by ARPC1A (604220).

DESCRIPTION Hippocalcin-like-1 is a member of a family of neuron-specific
Ca(2+)-binding proteins found in the retina and brain.

CLONING

Using rat hippocalcin (142622) cDNA as a probe in the screening of a
human hippocampus cDNA library under low stringency conditions,
Kobayashi et al. (1994) isolated a clone that encoded a novel
calcium-binding protein structurally related to hippocalcin. They showed
that this hippocalcin-like protein has a primary structure of 193 amino
acids and contains 3 EF-hand structures and a possible NH2-terminal
myristoylation site. A single transcript of 1.7 kb was detected only in
the brain.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids, Kobayashi et al. (1994) mapped the
HPCAL1 gene to chromosome 2.

605941	TITLE *605941 SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA ANTIGEN RECOGNIZED BY T CELLS 1; SART1
;;HOMS1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Genes encoding tumor-rejection antigens have been identified in
melanomas (e.g., MAGEC1; 300223). Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs)
recognize nonapeptides expressed on melanomas, and these nonapeptides
are targets for specific immunotherapy.

CLONING

By immunoscreening KE4 tumor cell cDNAs coexpressed with HLA-A2601 for
stimulation of gamma-interferon (IFNG; 147570) production by CTLs, and
by independent screenings of tumor and peripheral blood mononuclear cell
(PBMC) cDNA libraries, Shichijo et al. (1998) isolated cDNAs encoding
SART1. The putative bicistronic SART1 gene encodes an 800-amino acid
protein that contains a leucine zipper motif, and a variant 259-amino
acid protein that is inducible by Shine-Dalgarno sequences and does not
contain a leucine zipper motif. Northern blot analysis revealed
ubiquitous expression of a 2.6-kb transcript. Further screening
determined that CTLs only recognize SART1 when expressed in malignant
cells. Immunoblot analysis showed that the 800-amino acid SART1 is
expressed as a 125-kD protein in the nucleus of mitogen-activated PBMCs,
tumor cells, or normal cell lines, but not in normal tissues except
testis and fetal liver or in unstimulated PBMCs, suggesting preferential
expression in proliferating cells. Alternatively, Western blot analysis
detected expression of the 259-amino acid SART1 as a 43-kD cytosolic
protein in some cancer cell lines, but not in normal tissues except
testis and fetal liver. Screening for immunogenic peptides that could
induce CTL activity resulted in the identification of 3 nonapeptides in
the C termini of the SART1 proteins. Shichijo et al. (1998) proposed
that the 2 proteins may be involved in the regulation of proliferation
and transformation of epithelial cells and that 1 of the nonapeptides
may be useful for specific immunotherapy in HLA-A2601 patients.

Using serum IgE from atopic dermatitis patients to screen an epithelial
cell cDNA expression library, followed by probing a testis cDNA library,
Valenta et al. (1998) identified a cDNA encoding HOMS1, which is
identical to SART1 except that it lacks 126 nucleotides at the 5-prime
end of the open reading frame. The deduced protein contains a leucine
zipper motif, an abundance of glutamates, 2 N-glycosylation sites, 2
amidation sites, and 2 tyrosine kinase interaction sites. Southern blot
analysis indicated that SART1 is a single-copy gene. Immunoblot analysis
showed prominent expression of a 55-kD protein in skin, liver, lung, and
colon, weak expression in bone marrow, bone, uterus, stomach, and
muscle, and no expression in brain. Immunohistochemical analysis
demonstrated cytoplasmic and probably endosomal expression in epidermal
suprabasal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts and epithelial cells.
Immunoblot analysis also detected circulating SART1 antigen in the sera
of atopic patients.

GENE FUNCTION

Makarova et al. (2001) showed that increasing amounts of anti-SART1
antibody resulted in accumulation of unspliced pre-mRNAs, suggesting
that SART1 has a role in pre-mRNA splicing. Immunodepletion of SART1
strongly inhibited splicing. Immunoprecipitation at increasing salt
concentrations demonstrated that SART1 was not required for stability of
the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP but was essential for recruitment of the
tri-snRNP to the prespliceosome.

Using a library of endoribonuclease-prepared short interfering RNAs
(esiRNAs), Kittler et al. (2004) identified 37 genes required for cell
division, one of which was SART1. These 37 genes included several
splicing factors for which knockdown generates mitotic spindle defects.
In addition, a putative nuclear-export terminator was found to speed up
cell proliferation and mitotic progression after knockdown.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Wheatley et al. (2002) determined that SART1 contains at least 20 exons
of varying lengths as well as 4 novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms,
one of which resulted in an amino acid substitution. Sib pair analysis
in 51 English families with asthma and atopy revealed significant
association (p = .008) for this polymorphism with atopy, but not with
asthma. The authors hypothesized that polymorphic variation within the
SART1 gene may account for some individuals developing atopy.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SART1
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP stSG8781).

604346	TITLE *604346 MANNOSIDASE, ALPHA, CLASS 1B, MEMBER 1; MAN1B1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The MAN1B1 gene encodes endoplasmic reticulum mannosyl-oligosaccharide
1,2-alpha-mannosidase (EC 3.2.1.113), an enzyme that belongs to a family
of enzymes involved in the maturation of N-linked glycans in the
secretory pathway. These enzymes also contribute to the timing and
disposal of misfolded glycoproteins through the
endoplasmic-reticulum-associated degradation pathway (summary by Rafiq
et al., 2011).

CLONING

By 5-prime RACE of human placental cDNA using primers designed from ESTs
that showed similarity to mammalian and yeast oligosaccharide-processing
mannosidases, Gonzalez et al. (1999) isolated a cDNA encoding a human
alpha-1,2-mannosidase. The full-length cDNA predicts a 663-amino acid
protein with a molecular mass of 76,002 Da and a sequence characteristic
of type II transmembrane polypeptides. Northern blot analysis detected a
2.8-kb transcript in all tissues examined. Substrate specificity and
inhibitor sensitivity of a recombinant protein derived from the cDNA and
expressed in COS cells indicated that the cDNA encodes the ER
mannosidase I enzyme. Immunolocalization of epitope-tagged ER
mannosidase I showed colocalization with ER marker proteins.

Using the yeast alpha-1,2-mannosidase amino acid sequence to search the
EST database, Tremblay and Herscovics (1999) independently identified
MAN1B1. They cloned a MAN1B1 cDNA from a fetal brain cDNA library. The
deduced 699-amino acid protein contains a cytoplasmic tail and a
putative transmembrane domain. Northern blot analysis detected a 3-kb
MAN1B1 transcript at variable levels in all tissues examined, with
particularly high expression in testis and relatively low expression in
lung and muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Tremblay and Herscovics (1999) characterized the enzymatic activity of
MAN1B1 by expressing a recombinant protein containing the catalytic
domain as a secreted protein in Pichia pastoris. Using HPLC and NMR
analysis, they demonstrated that the recombinant MAN1B1 removed a single
mannose residue from Man9GlcNAc, specifically converting it to
Man8GlcNAc isomer B. The enzyme activity required calcium and was
inhibited by the class I alpha-mannosidase inhibitors
1-deoxymannojirimycin and kifunensine.

MAPPING

Tremblay and Herscovics (1999) identified the MAN1B1 sequence in a
chromosome 9 cosmid library clone.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 5 families with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic
mental retardation-15 (MRT15; 6142020), Rafiq et al. (2011) identified 3
different homozygous mutations in the MAN1B1 gene
(604346.0001-604346.0003).

MAN1B1, GLU397LYS

In affected members of 3 consanguineous Pakistani families with
nonsyndromic autosomal recessive mental retardation-15 (614202), Rafiq
et al. (2011) identified a homozygous 1189G-A transition in the MAN1B1
gene, resulting in a glu397-to-lys (E397K) substitution in the base of
the active site pocket of the enzyme, where it interacts with glycan
substrates. Expression studies showed that the mutant protein was
expressed and secreted at less than 5% of wildtype levels.

In 3 sibs, born of consanguineous Pakistani parents, with MRT15
(614202), Rafiq et al. (2011) identified a homozygous 1418G-A transition
in exon 9 of the MAN1B1 gene, resulting in a trp473-to-ter (W473X)
substitution, predicted to result in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. In
addition to mental retardation, these patients showed dysmorphic
features, including downslanting palpebral fissures, hypertelorism, long
face, flattened malar region, short philtrum, broad nasal root, and
small chin.

In 3 Iranian sibs with MRT15 (614202), offspring of consanguineous
parents, Rafiq et al. (2011) identified a homozygous 1000C-T transition
in the MAN1B1 gene, resulting in an arg334-to-cys (R334C) substitution
in the base of the active site pocket of the enzyme, where it interacts
with glycan substrates. Expression studies showed that the mutant
protein was expressed and secreted at about 20% that of wildtype levels
and had significantly decreased catalytic activity. In addition to
mental retardation, these patients showed dysmorphic features, including
mild dolichocephaly, downslanting palpebral fissures, hypertelorism,
broad and long eyebrows, flat philtrum, thin upper lip, triangular and
pointed chin, and prominent nose.

615203	TITLE *615203 RHOMBOID DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; RHBDD2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

RHBDD2 is a distantly related member of the rhomboid family of
membrane-bound proteases that catalyze regulated intramembrane
proteolysis (Ahmedli et al., 2013).

CLONING

Using database analysis to identify rhomboid-like genes that were
overexpressed in breast cancers, Abba et al. (2009) identified
full-length RHBDD2 and a splice variant lacking exon 2. Western blot
analysis revealed that full-length RHBDD2 had an apparent molecular mass
of 47 kD, whereas the smaller isoform had an apparent molecular mass of
40 kD.

Independently, Ahmedli et al. (2013) identified full-length human
RHBDD2, which encodes a 364-amino acid protein. They also identified 2
variants that, compared with full-length RHBDD2, include insertions in
intron 1, and both encode a 223-amino acid protein. RHBDD2 was predicted
to have either 5 or 7 transmembrane helices and a potential glycine
zipper motif. Northern blot analysis detected a major transcript of
about 2.0 kb in all mouse tissues examined, with highest expression in
brain, kidney, testis, and ovary, and weaker expression in heart, liver,
spleen, embryo, and lung. Transcripts of 4.0 and 2.5 kb were also
detected in all tissues examined. All 3 transcripts were detected in
mouse retina. Quantitative RT-PCR of developing mouse retina revealed
low Rhbdd2 expression at postnatal day 1, with expression increasing to
a maximum at postnatal day 14, and decreasing to postnatal day 30. In
transfected HEK293 cells, mouse Rhbdd2 localized predominantly to the
cis-Golgi. Rhbdd2 retained its association with the Golgi marker Gm130
(GOLGA2; 602580) during the cell cycle and following disruption of the
Golgi with brefeldin A. Rhbdd2 also colocalized with Gm130 in the inner
segment of photoreceptor cells and in the perinuclear region of ganglion
cells in mouse retina.

GENE FUNCTION

Abba et al. (2009) found that expression of RHBDD2 was upregulated in
primary tumors from patients with recurrent breast cancer and in
advanced stage III breast carcinomas. RHBDD2 expression was linked to
shortened metastasis-free interval and relapse-free survival, but only
in patients with cancers negative for estrogen receptor-alpha (ESR1;
133430). Amplification at the RHBDD2 locus was detected in 21% of 98
invasive breast carcinomas and in MCF7 and T47D breast carcinoma cell
lines. Knockdown of RHBDD2 in MCF7 cells via small interfering RNA
reduced proliferation, but it did not affect cell viability or
morphology.

Ahmedli et al. (2013) found that disruption of the glycine zipper motif
in mouse Rhbdd2 disrupted its Golgi localization.

GENE STRUCTURE

Abba et al. (2009) determined that the RHBDD2 gene contains 5 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Abba et al. (2009) mapped the RHBDD2 gene
to chromosome 7q11.23.

609539	TITLE *609539 AT-RICH INTERACTION DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; ARID2
;;ARID-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2;;
BRG1-ASSOCIATED FACTOR, 200-KD; BAF200;;
KIAA1557
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ARID2 is a subunit of the PBAF chromatin-remodeling complex (see BAF180;
606083), which facilitates ligand-dependent transcriptional activation
by nuclear receptors (Yan et al., 2005).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned ARID2, which they designated
KIAA1557. RT-PCR ELISA detected ARID2 expression in all tissues and
specific brain regions examined, with highest expression in ovary and
lowest expression in spinal cord.

Mohrmann et al. (2004) identified ARID2 by searching for sequences
similar to Drosophila Bap170. The human and Drosophila proteins contain
an N-terminal ARID domain, followed by several LLxxLL motifs and
C-terminal canonical and variant C2H2-type zinc finger motifs.

Yan et al. (2005) purified ARID2, which they called BAF200, from PFAB
complexes isolated from HeLa cell nuclear extracts. By mass
spectrometry, database analysis, and PCR, they obtained full-length
ARID2 cDNA. The deduced protein contains 1,835 amino acids. Yan et al.
(2005) noted that all domains are conserved between human ARID2 and
Drosophila Bap170, including central proline- and glutamine-rich
regions.

GENE FUNCTION

By Western blot analysis, Yan et al. (2005) determined that ARID2 is an
integral component of PBAF. ARID2 interacted directly with BAF180 in the
absence of DNA. However, ARID2 was able to form a complex in cells
lacking BAF180, and suppression of ARID2 by small interfering RNA in
these cells reduced both basal and IFN-alpha (147660)-induced IFITM1
(604456) expression.

MAPPING

Nagase et al. (2000) stated that the ARID2 gene maps to chromosome 12.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Li et al. (2011) performed exome sequencing of 10 hepatitis C virus
(HCV)-associated hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs; 114550) and matched
normal tissue from 10 patients and a subsequent evaluation of additional
affected individuals, and discovered novel inactivating mutations of
ARID2 in 4 major subtypes of HCC (HCV-associated HCC, hepatitis B virus
(HBV)-associated HCC, alcohol-associated HCC, and HCC with no known
etiology). Notably, 18.2% of individuals with HCV-associated HCC in the
United States and Europe harbored ARID2 inactivating mutations,
suggesting that ARID2 is a tumor suppressor gene that is relatively
commonly mutated in this tumor subtype.

Biankin et al. (2012) performed exome sequencing and copy number
analysis to define genomic aberrations in a prospectively accrued
clinical cohort of 142 patients with early (stage I and II) sporadic
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Detailed analysis of 99 informative
tumors identified substantial heterogeneity with 2,016 nonsilent
mutations and 1,628 copy number variations. Biankin et al. (2012)
defined 16 significantly mutated genes, reaffirming known mutations and
uncovering novel mutated genes including additional genes involved in
chromatin modification (EPC1, 610999 and ARID2), DNA damage repair (ATM;
607585), and other mechanisms (ZIM2 (see 601483); MAP2K4, 601335; NALCN,
611549; SLC16A4, 603878; and MAGEA6, 300176). Integrative analysis with
in vitro functional data and animal models provided supportive evidence
for potential roles for these genetic aberrations in carcinogenesis.
Pathway-based analysis of recurrently mutated genes recapitulated
clustering in core signaling pathways in pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma, and identified new mutated genes in each pathway.
Biankin et al. (2012) also identified frequent and diverse somatic
aberrations in genes described traditionally as embryonic regulators of
axon guidance, particularly SLIT/ROBO (see 603742) signaling, which was
also evident in murine Sleeping Beauty transposon-mediated somatic
mutagenesis models of pancreatic cancer, providing further supportive
evidence for the potential involvement of axon guidance genes in
pancreatic carcinogenesis.
