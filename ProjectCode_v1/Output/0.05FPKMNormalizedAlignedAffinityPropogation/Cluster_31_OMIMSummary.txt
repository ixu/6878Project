;;SRY-RELATED HMG-BOX GENE 12;;
ISLET CELL ANTIBODY 12; ICA12
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The testis-determining gene SRY (480000) encodes a transcription factor
characterized by a DNA-binding motif known as the HMG (high mobility
group) box. The SOX gene family consists of genes related to SRY, with a
sequence identity of more than 60% to the SRY HMG box. See 600898.

CLONING

Kido et al. (1998) cloned Sox13 cDNA from a mouse 8.5-day embryo cDNA
library and found that expression in the adult mouse is restricted to
kidney and ovary. Roose et al. (1998) independently cloned a full-length
mouse Sox13 cDNA and found that high expression of Sox13 is restricted
to arteries during late embryogenesis. They also found that Sox13 binds
to the consensus HMG-box motif, AACAAAG, but does not transactivate
transcription from multimeric sites.

By screening a human fetal kidney cDNA library with mouse Sox13 cDNA as
a probe, Roose et al. (1999) isolated a human SOX13 cDNA. The deduced
SOX13 protein has 890 amino acids with a centrally located HMG box and
an N-terminal leucine zipper motif with a neighboring glutamine stretch
called a Q box. The protein shares 75% homology with mouse Sox13.
Sequence homology with other SOX proteins indicates that SOX13 is a
member of subfamily D. Northern blot analysis applied to human fetal
tissue samples revealed high expression of SOX13 in kidney, lung, and
liver and low expression in thymus, brain, spleen, and muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Using sera from patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM)
to screen a human islet cDNA library, Rabin et al. (1992) determined
that the SOX13 protein, which they termed ICA12, is an IDDM-specific
human autoantigen.

Melichar et al. (2007) identified Sox13 as a gamma-delta-specific gene
in the immune system. Using Sox13 transgenic mice, Melichar et al.
(2007) showed that this transcription factor promotes gamma-delta T cell
development while opposing alpha-beta T cell differentiation.
Conversely, mice deficient in Sox13 expression exhibited impaired
development of gamma-delta T cells but not alpha-beta T cells. One
mechanism of SOX13 function is the inhibition of signaling by the
developmentally important for Wnt/T cell factor (TCF) pathway. Melichar
et al. (2007) concluded that their data revealed a dominant pathway
regulating the developmental fate of these 2 lineages of T lymphocytes.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Roose et al. (1999) mapped the
SOX13 gene to chromosome 1q32.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By EST database searching with the sequences of EXT1 (608177), EXT2
(608210), and EXTL1 (601738), followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE,
Saito et al. (1998) cloned full-length cDNAs for 2 new members of the
EXT family, EXTL2 (602411) and EXTL3, which they called EXTR2 and EXTR1,
respectively. The deduced 919-amino acid EXTL3 protein contains a highly
conserved region in the C terminus common to other EXT proteins.
Northern blot analysis detected expression of 6.2- and 4.7-kb EXTR1
transcripts in all tissues tested except ovary. The larger transcript
was predominant in brain, skeletal muscle, and testis, and the shorter
transcript in heart, liver, thymus, and prostate.

Kobayashi et al. (2000) isolated a cDNA for a REG protein (see 167770)
receptor from a rat islet cDNA library. Cells into which the cDNA had
been introduced bound REG protein with high affinity. When the cDNA was
introduced into a pancreatic beta-cell line that showed REG-dependent
growth, the transformants exhibited a significant increase in the
incorporation of 5-prime-bromo-2-prime-deoxyuridine as well as in the
cell numbers in response to REG protein. A homology search revealed that
the rat REG protein receptor cDNA is a homolog of EXTL3. The rat and
human proteins share 97% sequence identity. Kobayashi et al. (2000)
found that REG receptor mRNA in the rat is detectable in liver, kidney,
stomach, small intestine, colon, adrenal gland, pituitary gland, and
brain, but not in heart, suggesting the possible involvement of the
REG-REG protein receptor signal system in a variety of cell types other
than pancreatic beta cells.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid analyses, Saito et al.
(1998) mapped the human EXTL3 gene to chromosome 8p21. By FISH,
radiation hybrid analysis, and inclusion within a mapped contig, Van Hul
et al. (1998) mapped the gene to 8p21-p12.

605493	TITLE *605493 TRIPARTITE MOTIF-CONTAINING 3; TRIM3
;;RING FINGER PROTEIN 22; RNF22;;
BRAIN-EXPRESSED RING FINGER; BERP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

El-Husseini and Vincent (1999) screened rat cerebellar mRNA for
nucleotide-binding proteins. Using the resulting RT-PCR product as a
probe to screen a rat brain cDNA library, they isolated a novel ring
finger cDNA, Rnf22, which they designated Berp. Berp encodes a member of
the RBCC subgroup of RING finger proteins characterized by 3 motifs: an
N-terminal ring finger, a B-box zinc finger, and a coiled-coil domain.
The rat Berp protein contains a 130-amino acid region that is 41%
identical to a repeat domain present in actin-binding proteins. Its C
terminus contains 6 repeats that are predicted to form a circular
beta-propeller similar to that in WD and kelch proteins. Northern blot
analysis detected highest expression of Berp in cerebellum, with weaker
expression in other brain regions as well as in lung, liver, kidney, and
heart. Using a yeast 2-hybrid system and immunoprecipitation
experiments, Berp was expressed in cytoplasm with a punctate pattern
similar to that of endogenous myosin Va (MYO5A; 160777), a pattern
characteristic of organelle-associated proteins.

Using rat Berp to screen a hippocampus cDNA library, followed by EST
database analysis and RT-PCR of cerebellar total RNA, El-Husseini et al.
(2001) cloned human BERP. The deduced 744-amino aid protein has an
N-terminal RING finger, followed by B-box motifs, a coiled-coil domain,
a putative actin-binding protein-like beta-sheet structure, and a
predicted C-terminal 6-blade beta-propeller domain. Human BERP shares
98% amino acid identity with rat and mouse Berp and about 30% identity
with the putative C. elegans ortholog. Northern blot analysis detected a
major 3-kb transcript in human brain. EST database analysis suggested
that BERP is also expressed in breast, heart, uterus, and testis.

GENE FUNCTION

El-Husseini and Vincent (1999) demonstrated that the RBCC domain of rat
BERP could homodimerize. Additionally, the C-terminal repeats of Berp
interacted with class V myosins. El-Husseini and Vincent (1999)
hypothesized that BERP may mediate interactions with various proteins,
allowing cargo transport via a myosin V-mediated pathway. BERP
interactions with class V myosins may also be important in organelle
transport and neurite outgrowth.

El-Husseini et al. (2000) demonstrated interaction between the RBCC
domain of rat BERP and a rat brain cDNA for a nonmuscle isoform of
alpha-actinin, Actn4 (604638). Using immunohistochemistry, El-Husseini
et al. (2000) showed that both Berp and Actn4 were expressed in a
punctate pattern throughout the cytoplasm and neuritic processes of
differentiated PC12 cells. They concluded that BERP may serve to anchor
class V myosin to particular cell domains via its interaction with
ACTN4.

Using mutation analysis and reporter gene assays, Cheung et al. (2010)
found that only 1 of 4 putative p53 (TP53; 191170)-binding sites in the
promoter region of human BERP activated BERP expression. Similarly,
treatment with pentylenetetrazol upregulated Berp expression in p53 +/+
mouse hippocampal neurons, but not in p53 -/- hippocampal neurons.

GENE STRUCTURE

El-Husseini et al. (2001) determined that the TRIM3 gene contains 11
coding exons.

Cheung et al. (2010) identified a functional p53-binding site within
intron 1 of the TRIM3 gene.

MAPPING

Using FISH, El-Husseini et al. (2001) mapped the TRIM3 gene to
chromosome 11p15.5.

ANIMAL MODEL

Cheung et al. (2010) found that Berp -/- mice were born at the expected
mendelian ratio and were viable, healthy, and fertile, with no gross or
histologic abnormalities. Berp -/- mice were more resistant to
pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures than wildtype mice. Patch-clamp
recordings showed that cortical neurons from Berp -/- mice exhibited
reduced mean miniature inhibitory postsynaptic current frequency and
amplitude compared with wildtype neurons, which appeared to be due to
reduced surface expression of the Gabrg2 (137164) GABA receptor subunit.
Gabrg2 mRNA content was not altered in Berp -/- neurons.

;;GRIN2;;
KIAA0514
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned GPRIN2, which they designated
KIAA0514. The transcript contains repetitive elements in its 3-prime
UTR, and the deduced 461-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of 66 kD. RT-PCR of human tissues detected low expression in kidney
and lung.

By database analysis using mouse Gprin1 (611239) as probe, Chen et al.
(1999) identified human GPRIN2, which they called GRIN2. The deduced
461-amino acid sequence shares high homology with GPRIN1 and GPRIN3
(611241) over the C-terminal region (Iida and Kozasa, 2004). Northern
blot analysis of mouse tissues detected expression in brain only, and
Northern blot analysis of human brain regions found expression
restricted to the cerebellum.

GENE FUNCTION

Using recombinant GPRIN2 expressed in insect cells, as well as
immunoprecipitation studies from transfected COS cells, Chen et al.
(1999) and Iida and Kozasa (2004) showed that GPRIN2 interacted
specifically with G-alpha-o (GNAO1; 139311) and G-alpha-z (GNAZ; 139160)
bound to GTP-gamma-S and GDP-AlF4(-), but did not interact with
GDP-bound forms of either G protein subunit. Chen et al. (1999) showed
that coexpression of GPRIN1 or GPRIN2 with activated G-alpha-o caused
formation and extension of neurite-like processes in mouse neuroblastoma
cells.

POPULATION GENETICS

By analyzing short-read mapping depth for 159 human genomes, Sudmant et
al. (2010) demonstrated accurate estimation of absolute copy number for
duplications as small as 1.9 kb pairs, ranging from 0 to 48 copies.
Sudmant et al. (2010) identified 4.1 million 'singly unique nucleotide'
positions informative in distinguishing specific copies and used them to
genotype the copy and content of specific paralogs within highly
duplicated gene families. These data identified human-specific
expansions in genes associated with brain development, such as GPRIN2
and SRGAP2 (606524), which have been implicated in neurite outgrowth and
branching. Also included were the brain-specific HYDIN2 gene (610813),
associated with micro- and macrocephaly; DRD5 (126453), a dopamine D5
receptor; and the GTF2I (601679) transcription factors, whose deletion
has been associated with visual-spatial and sociability deficits among
Williams-Beuren syndrome (194050) patients, among others. The data of
Sudmant et al. (2010) also revealed extensive population genetic
diversity, especially among the genes NPEPPS (606793), UGT2B17 (601903),
and NBPF1 (610501), as well as LILRA3 (604818), which is the most highly
stratified gene by copy number in the human genome. In addition, Sudmant
et al. (2010) detected signatures consistent with gene conversion in the
human species.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the GPRIN2
gene to chromosome 10.

604110	TITLE *604110 G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR 56; GPR56
;;7-@TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN WITH NO EGF-LIKE N-TERMINAL DOMAINS 1; TM7XN1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

G protein-coupled receptors (GPRs), including GPR56, are characterized
by the presence of 7 transmembrane domains and are divided into several
classes based on sequence characteristics. Class B GPRs, or the
secretin-like receptors, include the secretin receptor (182098) and the
calcitonin receptor (114131). The orphan receptors HE6 (300572), CD97
(601211), EMR1 (600493), and BAI1 (602682) share significant homology
with class B GPRs across the 7-transmembrane region, but have a distinct
N-terminal region containing a characteristic cysteine box, which
precedes the first membrane-spanning domain, and a mucin-like domain
(summary by Liu et al., 1999).

CLONING

By PCR of human cDNAs with degenerate primers based on conserved regions
from secretin-like receptors, Liu et al. (1999) isolated a cDNA encoding
a novel receptor, which they designated GPR56. The predicted 693-amino
acid GPR56 protein shares 26 to 32% sequence identity with the 4 class
B-like orphan receptors. Like these receptors, GPR56 contains 7
transmembrane domains as well as a mucin-like domain and cysteine box in
the N-terminal region. Northern blot analysis revealed that the GPR56
gene was expressed as a 3-kb mRNA in a wide range of tissues, with the
highest levels in thyroid. Using in situ hybridization, Liu et al.
(1999) determined that the GPR56 gene was expressed selectively within
the monolayer of cuboidal epithelial cells of the smaller, more actively
secreting follicles of human thyroid.

Using differential display, Zendman et al. (1999) identified a GPR56
cDNA as a transcript that was differentially expressed in melanoma cell
lines with different metastatic potential. They designated the gene
TM7XN1 (7-transmembrane protein with no EGF-like N-terminal domains-1)
because the protein lacks the EGF-like domains found in the related GPRs
CD97 and EMR1. Zendman et al. (1999) reported that the TM7XN1 protein
contains 687 amino acids. RT-PCR and Northern blot analyses indicated
that TM7XN1 gene expression was inversely correlated with metastatic
potential in melanoma cell lines.

GENE STRUCTURE

Piao et al. (2004) stated that the GPR56 gene contains 14 exons covering
15 kb and has a 3-kb open reading frame.

MAPPING

By FISH, analysis of a radiation hybrid panel, and its inclusion within
mapped clones, Liu et al. (1999) mapped the GPR56 gene to chromosome
16q13. Using interspecific backcross analysis, they mapped the mouse
Gpr56 gene to the distal region of chromosome 8, in a segment sharing
homology of synteny with human 16q13.

GENE FUNCTION

Piao et al. (2004) found that GPR56 is preferentially expressed in
neuronal progenitor cells of the cerebral cortical ventricular, and
subventricular zones during periods of neurogenesis, but not in the
cortical plate or intermediate zone. In mice, they observed expression
in proliferative regions of the medial and lateral ganglionic eminence
at embryonic days 12, 14, and 16, where up to one-third of cerebral
cortical neurons, predominantly interneurons, are formed and
subsequently migrate nonradially into the cerebral cortex as well as
several other brain areas. In the adult mouse brain, Gpr56 expression
was limited to scattered cells more common in white matter than in gray
matter. On the other hand, more intense Gpr56 expression was observed in
regions of adult brain that show postnatal neurogenesis, such as the
dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone of the rostral migratory
stream leading to the olfactory bulb. Human GPR56 expression has been
shown in a wide range of different tissues including heart, kidney,
testis, pancreas, thyroid gland, and skeletal muscle (Liu et al., 1999).
The pattern of GPR56 expression and the anatomy of bilateral
frontoparietal polymicrogyria (BFPP; 606854) imply that GPR56 most
likely regulates cortical patterning. The most severely affected
cortical regions in BFPP are strikingly thin, and many forms of
polymicrogyria show cortical alterations with reduction of the normal 6
cortical layers to 4, suggesting possible roles in cell fate control
that would be consistent with the expression of GPR56 in progenitor
cells.

Xu et al. (2006) found that GPR56 was downregulated in tumors derived
from highly metastatic human melanoma cell lines. Overexpression of
GPR56 suppressed tumor growth and metastasis, whereas reduced GPR56
expression enhanced tumor progression. GPR56 bound specifically to
tissue transglutaminase (TGM2; 190196) in the extracellular space, which
was previously implicated as an inhibitor of tumor progression. Mutation
analysis indicated that the N terminus of GPR56 interacted with the C
terminus of TGM2. Xu et al. (2006) concluded that an interaction between
GPR56 and TGM2 could suppress tumor growth and metastasis.

In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), GPR56 undergoes autoproteolysis via
the GPCR proteolysis site (GPS) to split the protein into an N-terminal
adhesion ectodomain (ECD) fragment, called the alpha-subunit, and a
C-terminal signaling 7-pass transmembrane (7TM) moiety, called the
beta-subunit. The alpha- and beta-subunits associate noncovalently on
the cell surface. This autoproteolysis is essential for proper
subcellular trafficking and function of GPR56. Chiang et al. (2011)
showed that the alpha-subunit contains many predicted N- and O-linked
glycosylation sites and was shed from the membrane via a second cleavage
event. However, membrane-bound alpha-subunit also interacted with a
ligand to promote cell adhesion. Membrane localization of each subunit
differed somewhat: the alpha-subunit localized to the nonraft fraction,
whereas the beta-subunit localized to both the lipid raft and nonraft
fractions. Western blot analysis showed that the alpha-subunit of GPR56
did not bind to human TGM2 but did bind to murine Tgm2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 12 families with autosomal recessive inheritance of bilateral
frontoparietal polymicrogyria (BFPP; 606854) of various ethnic origins,
Piao et al. (2004) identified 8 different homozygous splice site,
frameshift, and missense mutations in the GPR56 gene
(604110.0001-604110.0008). All missense mutations affected regions of
the protein predicted to represent the extracellular portion of GPR56; 4
mutations affected the extracellular N terminus of the protein, and 1
the extracellular loop between transmembrane domains 4 and 5.

Using in vitro studies, Chiang et al. (2011) demonstrated that
BFPP-associated missense mutations cause the disorder via different
mechanisms, including reduced surface receptor expression, loss of
autoproteolysis, reduced receptor shedding, inability to interact with
ligands, and differential distribution of the 7TM beta-subunit in
membrane lipid rafts. The R38W (604110.0004), Y88C (604110.0008), C91S
(604110.0007), R565W (604110.0006), and L640R mutations did not affect
autoproteolysis, although there was less abundance of both the
N-terminal alpha-subunit and C-terminal 7TM beta-subunit. There was much
weaker expression of the beta-subunit for the R565W mutation compared to
the other mutants. In contrast, the C346S (605110.0005) and W349S
mutations abolished GPS autoproteolysis. Flow cytometric analysis of all
the mutants showed markedly decreased cell surface expression of the
GPR56 receptor, and the mutant proteins were found to be retained in the
ER. Mutants C346S and W349S showed lack of shedding of the
alpha-subunit. The 3 N-terminal missense mutations R38W, Y88C, and C91S
impaired binding of GPR56 to its ligand and thus reduced cell adhesion
activity. The beta-subunits of the R565W and L640R mutants were heavily
aggregated and localized mostly to the nonraft fractions with only
minimum normal distribution to lipid rafts, suggesting that they induced
conformational changes to the beta-subunit, leading to differential
distribution of the membrane subdomains and impaired intracellular
signaling.

In a nonconsanguineous family from the Gujarat region of India with 2

al. (2004) identified homozygosity for a 7-bp deletion of nucleotides
739 through 746 of the GPR56 gene (739_746delCAGGACC). This mutation was
also identified in a consanguineous Pakistani family and a
consanguineous Pashtun Afghan family. SNP analysis suggested a common
founder mutation since all patients shared alleles for 6 SNP markers
within the GPR56 locus. Gujarat and Afghanistan both border Pakistan,
and many tribes in Afghanistan are originally from India. Therefore, the
common ancestral mutations in these 3 pedigrees is plausible but
suggests a founder mutation maintained through a substantial population
(greater than 200 million people) and history.

;;EPSIN 4; EPN4;;
EPSIN-RELATED PROTEIN; EPNR;;
ENTHOPROTIN;;
KIAA0171
DESCRIPTION For background information on epsins, see EPN1 (607262).

CLONING

Nagase et al. (1996) isolated a cDNA encoding EPN4, which they
designated KIAA0171, from the immature myeloid cell line KG-1. The
deduced protein contains 625 amino acids. Northern blot analysis
revealed moderate expression in all tissues tested, with highest
expression in skeletal muscle.

Wasiak et al. (2002) identified rat Epn4, which they called enthoprotin,
by subcellular proteomics of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs). Epn4 was
highly enriched on CCVs isolated from rat brain and liver extracts. By
sequence analysis of tryptic peptides, they identified an epsin
N-terminal homology (ENTH) domain and a consensus type-2 clathrin box in
the C-terminal domain. The predicted molecular mass is about 68 kD, and
Epn4 expressed by transfected COS-7 cells showed an apparent molecular
mass of about 80 kD. Endogenous Epn4 localized in COS-7 cells in a
punctate pattern that was enriched in a perinuclear pool that
colocalized with clathrin (118955) and with the clathrin adaptor protein
complex AP1 (see 607291).

GENE FUNCTION

Using pull-down assays, Wasiak et al. (2002) found that rat Epn4
interacts with AP1, AP2, clathrin, and GGA2 (606005). They determined
that, through its C-terminal domain, Epn4 binds to the terminal domain
of the clathrin heavy chain and stimulates clathrin assembly.

Saint-Pol et al. (2004) found that HeLa cell EPN4 was involved in
retrograde transport of endogenous cargo proteins and bacterial Shiga
toxin from early and recycling endosomes to the trans-Golgi network.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1996) mapped the EPN4 gene
to chromosome 5.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Pimm et al. (2005) investigated 450 unrelated white English, Irish,
Welsh, and Scottish research subjects with schizophrenia and 450
ancestrally matched supernormal controls. Four adjacent markers at the
5-prime end of the EPN4 gene showed significant evidence of linkage
disequilibrium with schizophrenia. These included included 2
microsatellite markers and 2 SNPs within the EPN4 gene. A series of
different 2- and 3-marker haplotypes were also significantly associated
with schizophrenia. Since the EPN4 gene encodes enthoprotin, which has a
role in transport and stability of neurotransmitter vesicles at the
synapses and within neurons, they considered it likely that a
genetically determined abnormality in the structure, function, or
expression of this protein is responsible for genetic susceptibility to
a subtype of schizophrenia on 5q33.3 (SCZD1; 181510).

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Miller et al. (2007) characterized the molecular details governing the
sorting of a SNARE into clathrin-coated vesicles, namely, the direct
recognition of the 3-helical bundle H(abc) domain of the mouse SNARE
Vti1b (603207) by the human clathrin adaptor epsinR (EPNR, also known as
CLINT1). Structures of each domain and of their complex showed that this
interaction (dissociation constant 22 microM) is mediated by surface
patches composed of approximately 15 residues each, the topographies of
which are dependent on each domain's overall fold. Disruption of the
interface with point mutations abolished the interaction in vitro and
caused Vti1b to become relocalized to late endosomes and lysosomes.
Miller et al. (2007) stated that this new class of highly specific,
surface-surface interaction between the clathrin coat component and the
cargo is distinct from the widely observed binding of short, linear
cargo motifs by the assembly polypeptide (AP) complex and GGA adaptors
and is therefore not vulnerable to competition from standard
motif-containing cargoes for incorporation into clathrin-coated
vesicles. Miller et al. (2007) proposed that conceptually similar but
mechanistically different interactions direct the post-Golgi trafficking
of many SNAREs.

611989	TITLE *611989 MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN S27; MRPS27
;;KIAA0264
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mitochondria have their own translation system for production of 13
inner membrane proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation. MRPS27
is a component of the small subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome that
is encoded by the nuclear genome (Koc et al., 2001).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated immature myeloid
cell line cDNA library, Nagase et al. (1996) cloned MRPS27, which they
designated KIAA0264. The cDNA contains an Alu sequence, and the deduced
protein contains 415 amino acids. Northern blot analysis detected
expression in all tissues and cell lines examined, with highest levels
in heart and skeletal muscle.

By proteolytic digestion of whole bovine 28S subunits, followed by
peptide analysis and EST database analysis, Koc et al. (2001) identified
full-length human MRPS27. The deduced 414-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 47.7 kD. Removal of a predicted 36-amino
acid N-terminal mitochondrial localization signal results in a mature
43.8-kD protein. Koc et al. (2001) identified MRPS27 orthologs in mouse,
Drosophila, and C. elegans, but not in yeast or E. coli. Mouse and human
MRPS27 share 77.1% amino acid identity.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1996) mapped the MRPS27
gene to chromosome 5.

;;PLEXIN 4; PLXN4;;
TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN SEX; SEX
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In hunting for unknown genes on the human X chromosome, Maestrini et al.
(1996) identified a cDNA in Xq28 encoding a transmembrane protein, which
they termed SEX, of 1,871 amino acids. SEX shares significant homology
with the extracellular domain of the receptors encoded by the oncogenes
MET (164860), RON (600168), and SEA (165110), i.e., the hepatocyte
growth factor (HGF) receptor family. Further screening of cDNA libraries
identified 3 additional sequences closely related to SEX; they were
named SEP (601053), OCT (601054), and NOV (601055), and were located on
human chromosomes 3p, 1, and 3q, respectively, by screening a panel of
DNAs from hamster/human somatic cell hybrids. The proteins encoded by
these genes contain large cytoplasmic domains characterized by a
distinctive highly conserved sequence, which they called the SEX domain.
Northern blot analysis revealed different expression of the SEX family
of genes in fetal tissues, with SEX, OCT, and NOV predominantly
expressed in brain, and SEP expressed at highest levels in kidney. In
situ hybridization analysis revealed that a mouse SEX homolog has a
distinctive pattern of expression in the developing nervous system of
the mouse, where it is found in postmitotic neurons from the first
stages of neuronal differentiation (9.5 day postcoitus). The SEX protein
(220 kD) is glycosylated and exposed at the cell surface. Maestrini et
al. (1996) noted that, unlike the receptors of the HGF family, p220
(SEX), neither a MET-SEX chimera nor a constitutively dimerized TPR-SEX
showed tyrosinase kinase activity. The data defined a gene family,
called the SEX family by the authors, involved in the development of
neural and epithelial tissues which encodes putative receptors with
unexpected enzymatic and binding properties.

GENE FUNCTION

Tran et al. (2009) demonstrated that a secreted semaphorin, Sema3F
(601124), is a negative regulator of spine development and synaptic
structure. Mice with null mutations in genes encoding Sema3F, and its
holoreceptor components neuropilin-2 (NPN2; 602070) and PlexA3, exhibit
increased dentate gyrus granule cell and cortical layer V pyramidal
neuron spine number and size, and also aberrant spine distribution.
Moreover, Sema3F promotes loss of spines and excitatory synapses in
dissociated neurons in vitro, and in Npn2-null brain slices cortical
layer V and dentate gyrus granule cells exhibit increased miniature
excitatory postsynaptic current frequency. In contrast, a distinct
Sema3A (603961)-Npn1 (602069)/PlexA4 (604280) signaling cascade controls
basal dendritic arborization in layer V cortical neurons, but does not
influence spine morphogenesis or distribution. These disparate effects
of secreted semaphorins are reflected in the restricted dendritic
localization of Npn2 to apical dendrites and of Npn1 to all dendrites of
cortical pyramidal neurons. Therefore, Sema3F signaling controls spine
distribution along select dendritic processes, and distinct secreted
semaphorin signaling events orchestrate central nervous system
connectivity through the differential control of spine morphogenesis,
synapse formation, and elaboration of dendritic morphology.

NOMENCLATURE

Maestrini et al. (1996) stated that the gene was named SEX 'since it
maps on the long arm of the sex chromosome X.' They stated further that
the 'three SEX-related sequences were named SEP, OCT, and NOV, according
to the Latin ordinals following six.' Tamagnone et al. (1999) proposed a
novel nomenclature for the genes of the plexin family, which they
grouped into the A, B, C, and D subfamilies; the PLXN4 gene was renamed
plexin A3 by them.

607035	TITLE *607035 SUPPRESSOR OF FUSED, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF; SUFU
;;SUFUH
SUFUXL, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SUFU encodes a component of the Sonic hedgehog (SHH; 600725)/Patched
(PTCH; 601309) signaling pathway. Mutations in genes encoding components
of this pathway are deleterious for normal development and are
associated with cancer-predisposing syndromes (e.g., HPE3, 142945; BCNS,
109400; and GCPS, 175700).

CLONING

By EST database searching for homologs of Drosophila suppressor of fused
(Sufu), followed by RACE, Kogerman et al. (1999) obtained a cDNA
encoding human SUFU. The deduced 484-amino acid protein is 40% identical
to the fly protein. Northern blot analysis detected ubiquitous
expression of a minor 2.8-kb and a major 5.5-kb transcript. Whole-mount
in situ hybridization analysis detected expression throughout
midgestation in the neural tube and, later, in the neural tube's brain
and spinal cord derivatives, overlapping with expression of Ptch and
Gli1 (165220), Gli2 (165230), and Gli3 (165240). Similar analysis in a
12-week human embryo showed marked expression in perichondrial
osteoblasts, cells that also receive a hedgehog signal.

Stone et al. (1999) independently cloned and characterized SUFU and
identified shorter splice variants, truncated by 52 and 3 amino acids.
The full-length protein, which is 97% identical to the mouse protein,
contains a PEST sequence and multiple potential phosphorylation sites.
In addition to the same transcripts identified by Kogerman et al.
(1999), they detected smaller 2.0- and 1.0-kb transcripts in testis. By
semiquantitative PCR, they determined that the full-length isoform is
more abundant in all tissues.

Grimm et al. (2001) identified a low abundance isoform, SUFU-XL, of 485
amino acids as well as shorter isoforms restricted to leukocytes and
testis. They detected expression of normal SUFU and SUFU-XL in a panel
of tumor cDNA libraries. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that
neither of the shorter isoforms is able to bind GLI1.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Grimm et al. (2001) determined that the
mouse and human SUFU genes contain 12 exons.

MAPPING

By FISH, Stone et al. (1999) mapped the SUFU gene to chromosome
10q24-q25. Grimm et al. (2001) confirmed the localization by radiation
hybrid analysis. By FISH, Taylor et al. (2002) mapped the SUFU gene to
10q24.3 distal to the PTEN gene (601728), which maps to 10q23.31 and is
approximately 1 Mb telomeric to BTRC.

GENE FUNCTION

By luciferase reporter analysis, Kogerman et al. (1999) showed that SUFU
inhibits the transcriptional activity of GLI1 and osteogenic
differentiation in response to SHH signaling. Immunoprecipitation
analysis determined that SUFU and GLI1 are associated in an
intracellular complex. Confocal microscopy demonstrated both cytoplasmic
and nuclear expression of SUFU; however, colocalization with GLI1, due
to a central leucine-rich CRM1 (XPO1; 602559)-dependent nuclear-export
signal, was restricted to cytoplasm. Inhibition of CRM1 resulted in
nuclear expression of GLI1 in the absence of full-length SUFU that has
an intact C terminus necessary for GLI1-induced transcriptional
activation. Truncated GLI1 bound to DNA also interacted with SUFU.

By GST pull-down and yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Stone et al. (1999)
demonstrated that SUFU interacts with GLI2 and GLI3 through its extreme
C-terminal end, as well as with GLI1 and SLIMB (BTRC; 603482). Reporter
analysis indicated that BTRC containing an F-box domain potentiates the
inhibitory effect of SUFU on GLI activity. Stone et al. (1999) concluded
that SUFU is a direct negative regulator of GLI and that this regulation
may occur at multiple levels, possibly depending on the relative
intracellular concentrations of different signaling components.

In Drosophila, Cos2 is a major inhibitor of Shh signaling, and Sufu is a
minor inhibitor. Varjosalo et al. (2006) found the opposite was true in
mouse cells; RNA interference studies indicated Sufu was a major Shh
repressor and the mammalian orthologs of Cos2, Kif7 and Kif27, had no
effect.

Lee et al. (2007) found that expression of miR378 (MIRN378; 611957)
enhanced cell survival and reduced caspase-3 (CASP3; 600636) activity in
human glioma cells. Injection of miR378-expressing glioma cells into
nude mice showed that miR378 promoted tumor growth and angiogenesis. Lee
et al. (2007) identified miR378 target sequences in the 3-prime UTRs of
SUFU and FUS1 (TUSC2; 607052) transcripts, and they found that miR378
downregulated expression of both transcripts. Transfection and
overexpression of either SUFU or FUS1 overcame the growth-promoting
effects of miR378. Expression of miR378 repressed expression of reporter
gene constructs harboring the miR378 target sites of SUFU or FUS1.
RT-PCR and Western blot analysis showed that repression of SUFU occurred
posttranscriptionally, and the levels of SUFU protein and miR378 were
inversely correlated in a human cell lines.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Split Hand/Foot Malformation 3

Grimm et al. (2001) found no mutations in the SUFU gene in patients with
split-hand/foot malformation type 3 (SHFM3; 246560).

Lyle et al. (2006) used FISH and quantitative PCR to narrow the SHFM3
locus to a minimal 325-kb duplication containing only the BTRC (603482)
and POLL (606343) genes. Expression analysis of 13 candidate genes
within and flanking the duplicated region showed that BTRC and SUFU,
present in 3 copies and 2 copies, respectively, were overexpressed in
SHFM3 patients compared to controls. Lyle et al. (2006) suggested that
SHFM3 may be caused by overexpression of BTRC and SUFU, both of which
are involved in beta-catenin signaling.

- Medulloblastoma

Bayani et al. (2000) showed that loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on 10q24
is frequent in medulloblastomas (155255), suggesting that this region
contains 1 or more tumor suppressor genes. Taylor et al. (2002) reported
children with medulloblastoma who carried germline and somatic mutations
in SUFU in the SHH pathway, accompanied by LOH of the wildtype allele
(see, e.g., 607035.0001-607035.0006). Several of these mutations encoded
truncated proteins that are unable to export the GLI transcription
factor (165220) from nucleus to cytoplasm, resulting in the activation
of SHH signaling. Thus, SUFU is a tumor suppressor gene that predisposes
individuals to medulloblastoma by modulating the SHH signaling pathway
through a newly identified mechanism.

Taylor et al. (2002) noted that all 4 medulloblastomas with SUFU
truncating mutations were of the desmoplastic subtype. Desmoplastic
tumors make up about 20 to 30% of medulloblastomas, have a more nodular
architecture than 'classical' medulloblastoma, and may have a better
prognosis. Activation of the SHH pathway is particularly high in
desmoplastic medulloblastomas, as shown by increased expression of the
SHH target genes GLI, SMOH (601500), and PTCH (601309).

Brugieres et al. (2010) identified germline truncating SUFU mutations in
2 unrelated families with several children under 3 years of age
diagnosed with medulloblastoma (607035.0005 and 607035.0006,
respectively). Among the 25 mutation carriers in the 2 families, 7
developed medulloblastomas; of the 5 tumors for which histology was
reviewed, 3 were classified as medulloblastoma with extensive nodularity
(MBEN) and 2 were typical desmoplastic/nodular medulloblastoma. No
obvious physical stigmata of nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome was
found among 21 mutation carriers from both families who were examined,
including 11 patients who underwent brain MRI. SUFU sequence analysis of
1 tumor from each family confirmed that only the mutant allele was
detected in the tumor DNA, thus demonstrating the loss of the wildtype
allele and supporting a tumor suppressor role for SUFU.

- Susceptibility to Familial Meningioma

In affected members of a Finnish family with multiple adult-onset
meningiomas (607174), Aavikko et al. (2012) identified a germline
heterozygous mutation in the SUFU gene (R123C; 607035.0007). The
mutation was identified by genomewide linkage analysis combined with
exome sequencing. Tumor tissue from 7 meningiomas showed loss of
heterozygosity at the SUFU locus, consistent with a 2-hit model for
tumor suppressor genes. In vitro functional expression studies in human
rhabdomyosarcoma cells showed that the R123C mutant protein had a
significantly decreased ability to suppress GLI1 activity compared to
wildtype SUFU, resulting in aberrant activation of the hedgehog
signaling pathway.

- Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome

In affected members of a family exhibiting atypical signs and symptoms
of Gorlin syndrome (basal cell nevus syndrome; 109400), who were known
to be negative for mutation in the PTCH1 gene, Pastorino et al. (2009)
identified a splice site mutation (607035.0003) that had previously been
found in a desmoplastic medulloblastoma by Taylor et al. (2002).

ANIMAL MODEL

Svard et al. (2006) found that ablation of the mouse Sufu gene led to
lethality at about embryonic day 9.5 with cephalic and neural tube
defects. Fibroblasts derived from Sufu-null embryos showed high
Gli-mediated Shh pathway activity that was unaffected by either Smo
agonists or antagonists, but was partially sensitive to Pka (see 176911)
inhibition. Despite robust constitutive activity of Sufu-null
fibroblasts, Gli1 localization remained cytoplasmic. Mice heterozygous
for Sufu deletion appeared normal and were fertile; however, they
developed a skin phenotype with basaloid changes and jaw keratocysts,
characteristic features of BCNS. Svard et al. (2006) concluded that, in
contrast to Drosophila, mammalian SUFU has a central role in SHH
signaling, and its loss of function leads to potent ligand-independent
activation of the SHH pathway.

Pospisilik et al. (2010) found that hedgehog signaling was an important
determinant of adipose cell fate in Drosophila. They targeted Sufu
deletion to adipose tissue in mice and found that the mutant mice, which
they called aP2-SufuKO, were born healthy and at mendelian ratios.
Mutant mice displayed an immediate and obvious lean phenotype with
reduced white, but not brown, adipose tissue. Adipocyte size and total
numbers were reduced in mutant animals, and this was associated with
elevated hedgehog signaling and dysregulation of early adipogenic
factors. Lack of cutaneous and subcutaneous adipose stores in mutant
mice also resulted in cold stress at normal room temperature, but not at
elevated temperature. The mutant mice showed normal glucose tolerance
and insulin sensitivity.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MEDULLOBLASTOMA, SOMATIC
SUFU, PRO15LEU

In a medulloblastoma tumor (155255), Taylor et al. (2002) observed a
nonconservative missense mutation, pro15 to leu (P15L), near the N
terminus of SUFU. The mutation was accompanied by LOH in the wildtype
allele. The amino acid change was caused by a 44C-T transition. The
morphology of the tumor was not known.

.0002
MEDULLOBLASTOMA, DESMOPLASTIC
SUFU, 1-BP INS, 143A

In a patient with medulloblastoma of desmoplastic type (155255), Taylor
et al. (2002) found a 1-bp insertion, 143insA, in exon 1 of the SUFU
gene. The mutation caused frameshift followed by termination codon 69 bp
3-prime to the mutation.

.0003
MEDULLOBLASTOMA, DESMOPLASTIC, SOMATIC
BASAL CELL NEVUS SYNDROME, INCLUDED
SUFU, IVS8, G-A, +1

In a desmoplastic medulloblastoma (155255), Taylor et al. (2002) found
an IVS8+1G-A splice donor site mutation in the SUFU gene. The mutation
resulted in a frameshift at the 5-prime end and termination at the
3-prime end of exon 9. This was the second hit in this tumor, the first
hit being a germline 2.5-Mb deletion (deletion encompassing SUFU;
607035.0004). The patient had some features suggesting basal cell nevus
syndrome (109400). In addition to severe cognitive impairment and global
developmental delay, facial features included frontal bossing, prominent
jaw, and hypertelorism. Additional FISH experiments using contiguous BAC
clones showed that the deletion was 2.5-2.8 Mb in size and included at
least 28 genes. The most centromeric gene studied, BTRC (603482), was
not included in the deletion. The deletion was not present in either
parent.

In a father and son exhibiting atypical signs and symptoms of basal cell
nevus syndrome (109400), Pastorino et al. (2009) identified the known
1022+1G-A splice site transition in the SUFU gene. The mutation was not
detected in the clinically unaffected paternal grandparents, suggesting
that it arose de novo in the father; the mutation was also not found in
200 control alleles.

.0005
MEDULLOBLASTOMA, WITH EXTENSIVE NODULARITY
SUFU, 1-BP DEL, 71C

In 2 brothers who were diagnosed with medulloblastoma with extensive
nodularity (MBEN; see 155255) within the first 3 months of life,
Brugieres et al. (2010) identified heterozygosity for a 1-bp deletion
(71delC) in exon 1 of the SUFU gene, resulting in a frameshift and
premature stop codon. The deletion was also identified in the unaffected
mother, as well as the maternal grandfather, who had leiomyosarcoma, and
2 other unaffected relatives. The deletion was not found in 70 controls.

.0006
MEDULLOBLASTOMA, DESMOPLASTIC
MEDULLOBLASTOMA WITH EXTENSIVE NODULARITY, INCLUDED
SUFU, 1-BP INS, 71C

In 3 female cousins diagnosed with medulloblastoma (155255) before 3
years of age, 2 of whom had the desmoplastic type and 1 with
medulloblastoma with extensive nodularity (MBEN), Brugieres et al.
(2010) identified heterozygosity for a 1-bp insertion (71insC) in exon 1
of the SUFU gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature stop codon.
The maternal aunt of 1 of the cousins also died of medulloblastoma in
childhood, and the sister of another of the cousins died suddenly at 18
months of age with postmortem radiologic findings that were consistent
with medulloblastoma. The insertion was present in 17 of 33 family
members, 1 of whom had breast cancer and another meningioma, but not
found in 70 controls.

.0007
MENINGIOMA, FAMILIAL, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
SUFU, ARG123CYS (dbSNP rs202247756)

In affected members of a Finnish family with multiple adult-onset
meningiomas (607174), Aavikko et al. (2012) identified a germline
heterozygous 367C-T transition in the SUFU gene, resulting in an
arg123-to-cys (R123C) substitution (dbSNP rs202247756) in the core of
the N-terminal subdomain, which is central for the loop structure of the
protein. The mutation, which was identified by genomewide linkage
analysis combined with exome sequencing, was not found in 180 controls.
Tumor tissue from 7 meningiomas showed loss of heterozygosity at the
SUFU locus. In vitro functional expression studies in human
rhabdomyosarcoma cells showed that the R123C mutant protein had a
significantly decreased ability to suppress GLI1 (165220) activity
compared to wildtype SUFU, resulting in aberrant activation of the
hedgehog signaling pathway. Compared to the wildtype protein, the mutant
protein was expressed at lower levels and also bound to GLI1 less well.
Mutant SUFU was also unable to relocalize GLI1 into the cytoplasm. These
studies all indicated that the R123C mutation results in a partial loss
of SUFU function. Mutations in the SUFU gene were not found in 162
additional Finnish patients with meningiomas.

610386	TITLE *610386 BTB/POZ DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 7; BTBD7
;;FUP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By cDNA/EST microarray analysis, Pan et al. (2001) identified BTBD7,
which they called FUP1 (function unknown protein-1), as a gene expressed
preferentially in hepatocellular carcinoma compared to normal liver. The
deduced protein contains a predicted nucleus-targeting motif. Transient
transfection of FLAG-tagged FUP1 in NIH3T3 cells confirmed the nuclear
localization. Northern blot analysis detected highest expression of FUP1
in heart, with low expression in all other tissues tested.

GENE FUNCTION

By MTT assay, Pan et al. (2001) found that FUP1-transfected NIH3T3 cells
displayed increased cellular proliferation, whereas antisense
FUP1-transfected hepatoma cells displayed decreased proliferation. In
addition, injection of FUP1-transfected NIH3T3 cells into nude mice
induced tumor formation. Pan et al. (2001) concluded that FUP1
stimulates cell proliferation and tumor formation.

Using mouse submandibular salivary gland, a classical model for
analyzing mechanisms of branching morphogenesis, Onodera et al. (2010)
identified Btbd7 as a dynamic regulator of branching morphogenesis.
Btbd7 provided a mechanistic link between the extracellular matrix and
cleft propagation through its highly focal expression leading to local
regulation of Snail2 (SNAI2; 602150), E-cadherin (CDH1; 192090), and
epithelial cell motility. Inhibition experiments showed that Btbd7 was
required for branching of embryonic mammalian salivary glands and lungs.
Onodera et al. (2010) concluded that BTBD7 is a regulatory gene that
promotes epithelial tissue remodeling and formation of branched organs.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the BTBD7
gene to chromosome 14 (TMAP RH44522).

600392	TITLE *600392 RAD52, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF; RAD52
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ionizing radiation causes different types of DNA damage. Misrepair or
nonrepair of this damage may cause cell death, mutation, and neoplastic
transformation. Distinctive pathways of DNA repair respond to different
DNA damage. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 3 epistasis groups of DNA
damage-repair genes have been identified. The RAD52 epistasis group,
which is mainly responsible for DNA double-strand break repair, contains
8 genes: RAD50 through RAD57. One of these, RAD51 (179617), has been
cloned and found to have homology in yeast, chicken, mouse, and human to
the bacterial Rec-A (RECA) protein, which is required for homologous
recombination. See also RAD54L (603615). The RAD52 gene of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae is involved in DNA double-strand break repair and
mitotic/meiotic recombination. The N-terminal amino acid sequence is
highly conserved across species.

CLONING

Using the technology of mixed oligonucleotide primed amplification of
cDNA (MOPAC), Shen et al. (1995) amplified and sequenced 2 mouse RAD52
homologous cDNA fragments. Subsequently, they cloned cDNA of the human
and mouse homologs of the yeast RAD52 gene by screening cDNA libraries
using the identified mouse cDNA fragments.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

The human RAD52 protein forms a heptameric ring that catalyzes
homologous pairing. The N-terminal half of RAD52 is the catalytic domain
for homologous pairing, and the ring formed by the domain fragment was
reported to be approximately decameric. Splicing variants of RAD52 and a
yeast homolog, Rad59, are composed mostly of this domain. Kagawa et al.
(2002) determined the crystal structure of the homologous-pairing domain
of human RAD52 and found that the domain forms an undecameric ring. Each
monomer has a beta-beta-beta-alpha fold, which consists of highly
conserved amino acid residues among RAD52 homologs. A mutational
analysis revealed that the amino acid residues located between the
beta-beta-beta-alpha fold and the characteristic hairpin loop are
essential for single-stranded DNA and double-stranded DNA binding.

MAPPING

By DNA analysis of somatic cell hybrids and by fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Shen et al. (1995) assigned the human RAD52 gene to
12p13-p12.2.

;;MORT1-ASSOCIATED CED3 HOMOLOG; MACH;;
FADD-HOMOLOGOUS ICE/CED3-LIKE PROTEASE;;
FADD-LIKE ICE; FLICE;;
MCH5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

A cascade of protease reactions is believed to be responsible for the
apoptotic changes observed in mammalian cells undergoing programmed cell
death. This cascade involves members of the aspartate-specific cysteine
proteases of the ICE/CED3 (147678) family, also known as the caspase
family.

CLONING

Fernandes-Alnemri et al. (1996) identified the novel gene MCH5 when they
found a human EST sequence with significant homology to the newly
identified cysteine protease MCH4 (601762). They used PCR to clone a
cDNA of the MCH5 gene from a Jurkat T-cell cDNA library. Sequence
analysis revealed that it encodes a polypeptide of 496 amino acids with
greatest homology to MCH4. The authors found that MCH4 and MCH5 both
contain the active site pentapeptide QACQG instead of the QACRG present
in all other known members of the family. Furthermore, the authors found
that the sequences of MCH4 and MCH5 contain Fas-associating protein with
death domain (FADD)-like domains, suggesting possible interaction with
FADD. Fernandes-Alnemri et al. (1996) stated that MCH5, like other
members of the ICE/CED3 family, forms an active protease only after
cleavage of its proenzyme into 2 subunits which dimerize to form the
active enzyme.

Using MORT1 (FADD; 602457) in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a B-cell cDNA
library, Boldin et al. (1996) cloned several splice variants of CASP8,
which they called MACH. The isoforms could be divided into 2 main
subgroups. All isoforms share a common 182-amino acid N-terminal region,
including 2 MORT modules (i.e., death effector domains, or DEDs), but
they have different C termini. Subgroup alpha isoforms have C termini
containing a CED3/ICE homology domain that contains the catalytic site
and the substrate-binding pocket, while subgroup beta isoforms are
truncated and lack the CED3/ICE homology domain. The longest isoform,
MACH-alpha-1, encodes a deduced 479-amino acid protein. The CED3/ICE
domain of MACH-alpha-1 shares 41% and 34% identity with the homologous
regions in CPP32 (CASP3; 600636) and C. elegans CED3, respectively.
Northern blot analysis detected MACH transcripts ranging in size between
2.85 and 3.5 kb in all tissues examined, with highest levels in resting
peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes and lowest levels in testis and
skeletal muscle.

Eckhart et al. (2001) identified several CASP8 splice variants that
preferentially use a distant splice donor site at the 3-prime end of
exon 8. Use of this distant site, which they called exon 8b, results in
mRNAs with truncated open reading frames. RT-PCR indicated equal
expression of both mRNA species in tonsil, spleen, bone marrow, thymus,
and lymph nodes. Peripheral blood leukocytes, heart, and epidermis
predominantly expressed mRNA containing exon 8b, as did a promyelocytic
cell line and a T-cell line. Liver and nearly all immortalized cell
lines, as well as primary endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and
keratinocytes, expressed mRNA lacking the 8b extension.

GENE FUNCTION

Using fluorogenic peptide substrates corresponding to a sequence within
the nuclear protein PARP (173870), Boldin et al. (1996) confirmed that
MACH-alpha-1 is a thiol protease. By site-directed mutagenesis, they
identified cys360 as the catalytic cysteine. Using mutation analysis,
Boldin et al. (1996) determined that MACH binds to the N terminus of
MORT1. They also found that it self-associates, but it does not interact
directly with FAS/APO1 (TNRFSF6; 134637). Transfection of human
embryonic kidney cells and breast carcinoma cells with MACH-alpha-1 or
MACH-alpha-2 resulted in massive cell death.

Muzio et al. (1996) determined that CASP8, which they called FLICE,
interacts with wildtype FADD but not with FADD lacking the DED. They
also determined that granzyme B (GZMB; 123910) can remove the prodomain
and generate the active p20/p10 dimeric cysteine protease. Cleavage of
PARP by CASP8 resulted in the appearance of signature apoptotic
fragments. Transfection and overexpression of CASP8 in transfected
breast cancer cells resulted in apoptosis.

Expression of cDNAs that encode truncated polypeptides containing mostly
expanded polyglutamine repeats, but not of those that encode the
corresponding full-length proteins, has been shown to induce cell death
by apoptosis. Such truncated proteins have been shown to form aggregates
or inclusions (Ikeda et al., 1996). Sanchez et al. (1999) studied the
role of caspases in polyglutamine-induced cell death in established
cultures of primary cortical, striatal, and cerebellar neurons from
embryonic day 17 rat embryos, transfected with an expression construct
encoding truncated ataxin-3 that contained 79 glutamine (Q79) residues.
The authors showed that the apoptosis inhibitors Bcl2, CrmA, and a
truncated Fas/APO1-associated death domain protein (FADD DN) inhibited
polyglutamine repeat-induced neuronal cell death. A mutant Jurkat cell
line specifically lacking caspase-8 was resistant to
polyglutamine-induced cell death. Cells transfected with Q79 showed
insoluble inclusions. Caspase-8 was recruited and activated by these Q79
inclusions. Western blot analysis revealed the presence of activated
caspase-8 in the insoluble fraction of affected brain regions from
Huntington disease (143100) patients but not in those from controls. The
authors suggested that caspase-8 has an essential role in
Huntington-related neurodegenerative diseases.

Eckhart et al. (2001) found that different CASP8 isoforms were expressed
in resting and activated lymphocytes. Activation of lymphocytes shifted
the expression from mRNA species containing an exon 8b extension to
mRNAs that lack it. Differentiation in a promyelocytic cell line was
associated with the opposite shift, from mRNAs containing the shorter
exon 8 to mRNAs that include the exon 8b extension.

Gervais et al. (2002) found that HIP1 (601767) binds to the HIP1 protein
interactor (HIPPI; 606621), which has partial sequence homology to HIP1
and similar tissue and subcellular distribution. The availability of
free HIP1 is modulated by polyglutamine length within huntingtin
(613004), with disease-associated polyglutamine expansion favoring the
formation of proapoptotic HIPPI-HIP1 heterodimers. This heterodimer can
recruit procaspase-8 into a complex of HIPPI, HIP1, and procaspase-8,
and launch apoptosis through components of the extrinsic cell death
pathway. Gervais et al. (2002) proposed that huntingtin polyglutamine
expansion liberates HIP1 so that it can form a caspase-8 recruitment
complex with HIPPI, possibly contributing to neuronal death in
Huntington disease.

Yu et al. (2004) defined a novel molecular pathway in which activation
of the receptor-interacting protein (RIP; 603453), a serine-threonine
kinase, and Jun amino-terminal kinase (601158) induced cell death with
the morphology of autophagy. Autophagic death required the genes ATG7
(GSA7; 608760) and beclin-1 (604378) and was induced by caspase-8
inhibition. Yu et al. (2004) cautioned that clinical therapies involving
caspase inhibitors may arrest apoptosis but also have the unanticipated
effect of promoting autophagic cell death.

Poulaki et al. (2005) found that human retinoblastoma (RB1; 614041) cell
lines were resistant to death receptor (see DR5; 603612)-mediated
apoptosis because of a deficiency of CASP8 expression secondary to
epigenetic gene silencing by overmethylation. Treatment with a
demethylating agent restored CASP8 expression and sensitivity to
apoptosis.

Su et al. (2005) showed that caspase-8 deficiency (607271) in humans and
mice specifically abolishes activation of the transcription factor NF
kappa-B (164011) after stimulation through antigen receptors, Fc
receptors, or Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4; 603030) in T, B, and natural
killer cells. Caspase-8 also causes the alpha-beta complex of the
inhibitor of NF-kappa-B kinase (IKK; 600644 and 300248, respectively) to
associate with the upstream BCL10 (603517)-MALT1 (604860) adaptor
complex. Recruitment of the IKK-alpha,beta complex, its activation, and
the nuclear translocation of NF-kappa-B require enzyme activity of
full-length caspase-8. Su et al. (2005) concluded that their findings
explained the paradoxical association of defective apoptosis and
combined immunodeficiency in human caspase-8 deficiency.

Stupack et al. (2006) showed that suppression of caspase-8 expression
occurs during the establishment of neuroblastoma (256700) metastases in
vivo, and that reconstitution of caspase-8 expression in deficient
neuroblastoma cells suppressed their metastases. Caspase-8 status was
not a predictor of primary tumor growth; rather, caspase-8 selectively
potentiated apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells invading the collagenous
stroma at the tumor margin. Apoptosis was initiated by unligated
integrins (see 605025) by means of a process known as integrin-mediated
death. Loss of caspase-8 or integrin rendered the cells refractory to
integrin-mediated death, allowed cellular survival in the stromal
microenvironment, and promoted metastases. Stupack et al. (2006)
concluded that these findings define caspase-8 as a metastasis
suppressor gene that, together with integrins, regulates the survival
and invasive capacity of neuroblastoma cells.

Oberst et al. (2011) showed that development of caspase-8-deficient mice
is completely rescued by ablation of receptor-interacting protein
kinase-3 (RIPK3; 605817). Adult animals lacking both caspase-8 and Ripk3
displayed a progressive lymphoaccumulative disease resembling that seen
with defects in Cd95 (FAS; 134637) or Cd95 ligand (FASL; 134638), and
resisted the lethal effects of Cd95 ligation in vivo. Oberst et al.
(2011) found that caspase-8 prevents RIPK3-dependent necrosis without
inducing apoptosis by functioning in a proteolytically active complex
with CFLAR (603599) and that this complex is required for the protective
function.

Kaiser et al. (2011) found that Ripk3 is responsible for the
midgestational death of Casp8-deficient embryos. Remarkably,
Casp8-null/Rip3-null-double mutant mice were viable and matured into
fertile adults with a full immune complement of myeloid and lymphoid
cell types. These mice seemed immunocompetent but developed
lymphadenopathy by 4 months of age marked by accumulation of abnormal T
cells in the periphery, a phenotype reminiscent of mice with Fas
deficiency. Thus, Kaiser et al. (2011) concluded that Casp8 contributes
to homeostatic control in the adult immune system; however, RIPK3 and
CASP8 are together completely dispensable for mammalian development.

Burguillos et al. (2011) showed that the orderly activation of caspase-8
and caspase-3/7 (600636/601761), known executioners of apoptotic cell
death, regulate microglia activation through a protein kinase C-delta
(PPKCD; 176977)-dependent pathway. Burguillos et al. (2011) found that
stimulation of microglia with various inflammogens activates caspase-8
and caspase-3/7 in microglia without triggering cell death in vitro and
in vivo. Knockdown or chemical inhibition of each of these caspases
hindered microglia activation and consequently reduced neurotoxicity.
The authors observed that these caspases are activated in microglia in
the ventral mesencephalon of Parkinson disease (168600) and the frontal
cortex of individuals with Alzheimer disease (104300). Burguillos et al.
(2011) concluded that caspase-8 and caspase-3/7 are involved in
regulating microglia activation, and suggested that inhibition of these
caspases could be neuroprotective by targeting the microglia rather than
the neurons themselves.

Gunther et al. (2011) demonstrated a critical role for caspase-8 in
regulating necroptosis of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and
terminal ileitis. Mice with a conditional deletion of caspase-8 in the
intestinal epithelium (Casp8-delta-IEC) spontaneously developed
inflammatory lesions in the terminal ileum were highly susceptible to
colitis. These mice lacked Paneth cells and showed reduced numbers of
goblet cells, indicating dysregulated antimicrobial immune cell
functions of the intestinal epithelium. Casp8-delta-IEC mice showed
increased cell death in the Paneth cell area of small intestinal crypts.
Epithelial cell death was induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFA;
191160), was associated with increased expression of
receptor-interacting protein-3 (RIP3; 605817) and could be inhibited on
blockade of necroptosis. Lastly, Gunther et al. (2011) identified high
levels of RIP3 in human Paneth cells and increased necroptosis in the
terminal ileum of patients with Crohn disease, suggesting a potential
role of necroptosis in the pathogenesis of this disease. Gunther et al.
(2011) concluded that their data demonstrated a critical function of
caspase-8 in regulating intestinal homeostasis and in protecting IECs
from TNFA-induced necroptotic cell death.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Varfolomeev et al. (1998) determined that
the CASP8 gene contains 8 exons. Hadano et al. (2001) determined that
the CASP8 gene contains 13 exons and spans 51.2 kb.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), Kischkel et al. (1998)
mapped the CASP8 gene to human chromosome 2q33-q34 and mouse chromosome
1B-proximal C. This mapping further extended the known homology of
synteny between these regions of human chromosome 2 and mouse chromosome
1. By FISH, Grenet et al. (1999) also mapped the CASP8 gene to 2q33-q34.
They noted that CASP10 (601762), whose product is closely related to
that of CASP8, has been mapped to the same location, indicating that the
2 genes have evolved by tandem duplication.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Liu et al. (2002) identified a naturally occurring deletion of leu62
within the first DED of CASP8 in A431 human vulva squamous carcinoma
cells. This deletion resulted in defective CASP8-dependent apoptosis.
Unlike wildtype CASP8, CASP8 lacking leu62 failed to form oligomers with
wildtype CASP8 and failed to interact with FADD. The mutation did not
effect proteolytic activation by granzyme B, nor did it effect catalytic
activity against PARP.

In 2 affected sibs from a consanguineous family with caspase-8
deficiency (607271), Chun et al. (2002) identified a homozygous mutation
in the CASP8 gene (601763.0001). The patients had defects in the
activation of T and B lymphocytes and natural killer cells, which led to
immunodeficiency.

Soung et al. (2005) analyzed the entire coding region of the CASP8 gene
in 69 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC; 114550), 2 with low-grade
dysplastic nodule (LGDN), 2 with high-grade dysplastic nodule (HGDN),
and 65 without dysplastic nodules, and detected a total of 9 somatic
mutations (13%). All 9 mutations were an identical 2-bp deletion
(nucleotides 1225-1226; 601763.0002), which was predicted to result in
frameshift and premature termination of amino acid synthesis in the p10
protease subunit. The change was detected both in HCC and in LGDN
lesions, suggesting that CASP8 mutation may be involved in the early
stage of HCC carcinogenesis. Soung et al. (2005) found that expression
of the tumor-derived caspase-8 mutant in cells abolished cell death
activity of caspase-8.

Cox et al. (2007) reported the findings of the Breast Cancer Association
Consortium (BCAC), which had been established to conduct combined
case-control analyses with augmented statistical power to try to confirm
putative genetic associations with breast cancer. They genotyped 9 SNPs
for which there was some prior evidence of an association with breast
cancer (114480). They included data from 9 to 15 studies, comprising
11,391 to 18,290 cases and 14,753 to 22,670 controls. They found
evidence of a protective association with breast cancer for a D302H
polymorphism in CASP8 (601763.0003), and weaker evidence for an L10P SNP
in the TGFB1 gene (190180.0007). These results demonstrated that common
breast cancer susceptibility alleles with small effects on risk can be
identified, given sufficiently powerful studies.

Caspases are important in the life and death of immune cells and
therefore influence immune surveillance of malignancies. Sun et al.
(2007) tested whether genetic variants in CASP8, CASP10, (601762), and
CFLAR (603599), 3 genes important for death receptor-induced cell
killing residing in tandem order on chromosome 2q33, are associated with
cancer susceptibility. Using a haplotype-tagging SNP approach, they
identified a 6-nucleotide deletion (-652 6N del) variant in the CASP8
promoter (601763.0004) associated with decreased risk of lung cancer.
The deletion destroyed a binding site for stimulatory protein-1 (SP1;
189906) and decreased transcription. Biochemical analyses showed that T
lymphocytes with the deletion variant had lower caspase-8 activity and
activation-induced cell death upon stimulation with cancer cell
antigens. Case-control analyses of 4,995 individuals with cancer and
4,972 controls in a Chinese population showed that this genetic variant
is associated with reduced susceptibility to multiple cancers, including
lung, esophageal, gastric, colorectal, cervical, and breast cancers,
acting in an allele dose-dependent manner. The results supported the
hypothesis that genetic variants influencing immune status modify cancer
susceptibility. Haiman et al. (2008) did not find an association between
this SNP and breast (114480), colorectal (114500), or prostate (176807)
cancer among 2,098, 1,139, and 2,825 patients, respectively. The study
included patients in Hawaii and California of various ethnic groups.

ANIMAL MODEL

Varfolomeev et al. (1998) generated mice deficient in Casp8 by
disrupting exons 1 and 2, which encode the N-terminal death effector
domains (DEDs) that interact with MORT1/FADD. Whereas wildtype and
heterozygous mice appeared normal, no homozygous mutant mice survived
beyond approximately embryonic day 13.5. Histopathologic analysis
revealed marked abdominal hyperemia with erythrocytosis in the liver,
major blood vessels, capillaries, and other organs. Cardiac ventricular
musculature was thin and similar to early mesenchyme. Colony forming
assays showed that hemopoietic precursor cells were markedly reduced in
the mutant mice. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis indicated
that fibroblasts from mutant mice responded normally to the noncytocidal
effects of tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR; 191190) and death
receptor-3 (DR3, or TNFRSF12; 603366) stimulation, whereas wildtype
fibroblasts were killed by TNF (191160) treatment or FAS cross-linking.
Agents such as ultraviolet irradiation and protein kinase inhibitors
were lethal for mutant and normal fibroblasts. Varfolomeev et al. (1998)
concluded that CASP8 is necessary for death induction by receptors of
the TNF/nerve growth factor (see NGFR; 162010) family and is vital in
embryonal development.

Zender et al. (2003) evaluated the efficacy of small interfering RNA
(siRNA) in vivo in different mouse models with acute liver failure. They
directed 21-nucleotide siRNAs against caspase-8, which is a key enzyme
in death receptor-mediated apoptosis. Systemic administration of
caspase-8 siRNA resulted in inhibition of caspase-8 gene expression in
the liver, therefore preventing CD95-mediated apoptosis. Protection of
hepatocytes by caspase-8 siRNA significantly attenuated acute liver
damage induced by CD95 antibody or by adenovirus expressing FAS ligand.
In a clinical situation, siRNAs would most likely be administered after
the onset of acute liver failure. Therefore, Zender et al. (2003)
injected caspase-8 siRNA at a time during experimentally-induced liver
failure with already elevated liver transaminases. Improvement of
survival due to RNA interference was significant even when caspase-8
siRNA was applied during ongoing acute liver failure.

Salmena and Hakem (2005) used the Cre/lox recombinase system to generate
mice lacking Casp8 only in T cells (Tcasp8 -/- mice). Tcasp8 -/- mice
developed an age-dependent lethal lymphoproliferative and
lymphoinfiltrative immune disorder characterized by lymphoadenopathy,
splenomegaly, and T-cell infiltrates in lung, liver, and kidney.
Although there was lymphopenia in young Tcasp8 -/- mice, peripheral T
cells in old Tcasp8 -/- mice proliferated in the absence of infection or
stimulation. Salmena and Hakem (2005) proposed that Tcasp8 -/- mice may
serve as a model of human CASP8 deficiency and that CASP8 in T cells is
required for lymphocyte homeostasis.

To define the contribution of reduced caspase-8 to a wound healing
response, Lee et al. (2009) generated an epidermal knockout of
caspase-8. By postnatal day 10 the conditional knockout mouse had flaky
skin throughout its body, was slightly runted, and its epidermis was
dramatically thickened. Lee et al. (2009) found that even though
caspase-8 is normally expressed in the granular layer, it was the basal
and spinous layers that were markedly expanded in the knockout
epidermis. Lee et al. (2009) demonstrated that the loss of epidermal
caspase-8, an important mediator of apoptosis, recapitulated several
phases of a wound healing response in the mouse. The epidermal
hyperplasia in the caspase-8 null skin is the culmination of signals
exchanged between epidermal keratinocytes, dermal fibroblasts, and
leukocytic cells. This reciprocal interaction is initiated by the
paracrine signaling of interleukin 1-alpha (IL1-alpha; 147760), which
activates both skin stem cell proliferation and cutaneous inflammation.
The noncanonical secretion of IL1-alpha is induced by a p38-MAPK
(600289)-mediated upregulation of NALP3 (606416), leading to
inflammasome assembly and caspase-1 activation. Notably, the increased
proliferation of basal keratinocytes is counterbalanced by the growth
arrest of suprabasal keratinocytes in the stratified epidermis by
IL1-alpha-dependent NF-kappa-B (see 164011) signaling. Lee et al. (2009)
concluded that their findings illustrated how the loss of caspase-8 can
affect more than programmed cell death to alter the local
microenvironment and elicit processes common to wound repair and many
neoplastic skin disorders.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CASPASE 8 DEFICIENCY
CASP8, ARG248TRP

In 2 affected sibs from a consanguineous family with caspase-8
deficiency (607271), Chun et al. (2002) identified a homozygous C-to-T
transition in the CASP8 gene, resulting in an arg248-to-trp (R248W)
substitution within the p18 protease subunit of the protein. The
asymptomatic mother, father, and sister were heterozygous carriers of
the mutation. In 13 extended family members, Chun et al. (2002)
identified 7 asymptomatic heterozygous carriers but found no additional
homozygous or immunodeficient individuals.

.0002
HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA, SOMATIC
CASP8, 2-BP DEL, 1225TG

In 9 unrelated patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (114550) and HBV
infection, Soung et al. (2005) identified the same somatic mutation, a
2-bp deletion (1225_1226delTG) in exon 7 that was predicted to result in
frameshift and premature termination of amino acid synthesis in the p10
protease subunit.

.0003
BREAST CANCER, PROTECTION AGAINST
CASP8, ASP302HIS

MacPherson et al. (2004) and Frank et al. (2005) found evidence that the
presence of a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the CASP8 gene
resulting in an asp302-to-his (D302H) substitution (dbSNP rs1045485)
could reduce susceptibility to breast cancer (114480) in British and
German cohorts, respectively. Cox et al. (2007) found evidence for a
protective effect of the D302H polymorphism in an allele dose-dependent
manner in 16,423 cases and 17,109 controls from 14 studies that
contributed data to the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC). The
study achieved odds ratios of 0.89 and 0.74 for heterozygotes and rare
homozygotes, respectively, compared with common homozygotes. This site
was not found to be polymorphic in Korean, Han Chinese, or Japanese
women. Cox et al. (2007) noted that the functional consequences of the
aspartic acid-to-histidine substitution were not known, and further
experiments were required to establish whether D302H itself or another
variant in strong linkage disequilibrium with it is causative.

.0004
LUNG CANCER, PROTECTION AGAINST
CASP8, 6-BP DEL, NT-652

Sun et al. (2007) identified a 6-nucleotide insertion/deletion
polymorphism in the CASP8 promoter, -652 AGTAAG ins/del (dbSNP
rs3834129), the deletion variant of which was associated with decreased
risk of developing lung cancer (211980) in a population of Han Chinese
subjects. The -652 6N deletion was also associated with decreased risk
of cancer of various other forms including esophageal, gastric,
colorectal, cervical, and breast, acting in an allele dose-dependent
manner. The frequency of the -652 6N deletion was significantly lower in
individuals with lung cancer (P = 4.1 x 10(-5)).

Haiman et al. (2008) did not find an association between this SNP and
breast (114480), colorectal (114500), or prostate (176807) cancer among
2,098, 1,139, and 2,825 patients, respectively. The study included
patients in Hawaii and California of various ethnic groups.

607199	TITLE *607199 INTERFERON REGULATORY FACTOR 6; IRF6
DESCRIPTION 
GENE FAMILY

Interferon regulatory factor-6 (IRF6) belongs to a family of 9
transcription factors that share a highly-conserved helix-turn-helix
DNA-binding domain and a less conserved protein-binding domain. This
domain, called SMIR (for SMAD (see 601366)-IRF-binding domain), is also
found in IRF3 (603734) and IRF7 (605047). Other interferon regulatory
factors include IRF1 (147575) on 5q, IRF2 (147576) on 4q, IRF3 on 19q,
and IRF4 (601900) on 6p. Most IRFs regulate the expression of
interferon-alpha (see 147660) and -beta (see 147640) after viral
infection.

CLONING

Kondo et al. (2002) cloned human IRF6. The deduced protein contains an
N-terminal winged-helix DNA-binding domain and a C-terminal SMIR
(Smad-interferon regulatory factor-binding) domain. RT-PCR analysis
showed that Irf6 is broadly expressed in embryonic and adult mouse
tissues. A similar expression pattern was seen in human fetal and adult
tissues. In situ hybridization of mouse embryos demonstrated that Irf6
is highly expressed in the medial edges of the paired palatal shelves
immediately before, and during, their fusion. High Irf6 expression was
also detected in hair follicles, palatal rugae, tooth germ and
thyroglossal duct, external genitalia, and in skin throughout the body.

Ben et al. (2005) determined that the human IRF6 protein contains 517
amino acids.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kondo et al. (2002) determined that the IRF6 gene contains 10 exons.
Exons 1, 2, and 10 are noncoding.

Ben et al. (2005) found strong structural conservation among human,
mouse, zebrafish and Fugu Irf6 orthologs, especially in the 7 coding
exons.

MAPPING

Kondo et al. (2002) identified the IRF6 gene within the VWS critical
region at 1q32-q41.

GENE FUNCTION

Mutation in the IRF6 gene can cause van der Woude syndrome (VWS1;
119300) and popliteal pterygium syndrome (PPS; 119500). VWS is an
autosomal dominant form of cleft lip and palate associated with lip
pits, and is the most common syndromic form of cleft lip or palate. PPS
is a disorder with a similar orofacial phenotype that also includes skin
and genital anomalies. Phenotypic overlap and linkage data had suggested
that these 2 disorders are allelic. To correlate the expression of IRF6
with the phenotypes of VWS and PPS, Kondo et al. (2002) conducted
expression analyses in mice. Studies showed high levels of Irf6 mRNA
along the medial edge of the fusing palate, tooth buds, hair follicles,
genitalia, and skin. Their observations demonstrated that
haploinsufficiency of IRF6 disrupts orofacial development and were
consistent with dominant-negative mutations disturbing development of
the skin and genitalia.

Little et al. (2009) determined the DNA sequence to which IRF6 binds and
used this sequence to analyze the effect of VWS- and PPS-associated
missense mutations (see, e.g., 607199.0004) in the DNA-binding domain of
IRF6. They showed that IRF6 functions as a cooperative transcriptional
activator and that mutations in the protein interaction domain (residues
226 to 467) of IRF6 disrupt this activity.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Van der Woude Syndrome

To identify the locus associated with van der Woude syndrome (119300),
Kondo et al. (2002) did a direct sequence analysis of genes and
presumptive transcripts in the 350-kb critical region on 1q identified
by linkage mapping. This approach was confounded by SNPs that occurred
about once every 1,900 basepairs. To distinguish between putative
disease-causing mutations and SNPs, they studied a pair of monozygotic
twins who were discordant for the VWS phenotype and had unaffected
parents. Monozygotic status was confirmed by showing complete
concordance of genotype at 20 microsatellite loci. The authors concluded
that the only sequence difference between the twins resulted from a
somatic mutation in the affected twin. Kondo et al. (2002) found a
nonsense mutation in IRF6 in the affected twin (607199.0001).
Subsequently, they identified mutations in IRF6 in 45 additional
unrelated families affected with VWS.

Ghassibe et al. (2004) screened the IRF6 gene in 6 families with VWS and
identified 6 heterozygous missense mutations, respectively, all
affecting either the DNA-binding or the protein-binding domain. In a
4-generation VWS family in which affected individuals carried an L22P
mutation (607199.0014), 2 of the patients displayed additional features:
1 had finger syndactyly, and the other had toe syndactyly and oral
synechiae. Ghassibe et al. (2004) stated that because syndactyly and
synechiae are major signs for PPS, these 2 patients were considered to
have PPS, whereas the 6 other affected family members were classified as
VWS, thus demonstrating that a single mutation could be responsible for
both syndromes.

In a 16-year-old girl with a heart-shaped mass on her inner lower lip
but no pits, Yeetong et al. (2009) identified heterozygosity for a
nonsense mutation in the IRF6 gene (Q49X; 607199.0017).

- Popliteal Pterygium Syndrome

In affected members of 5 unrelated families with popliteal pterygium
syndrome (PPS; 119500), Kondo et al. (2002) identified heterozygosity
for an arg84-to-cys (R84C; 607199.0004) mutation in the IRF6 gene. In 2
other PPS families, they identified an arg84-to-his (R84H; 607199.0005)
substitution.

Matsuzawa et al. (2010) identified a heterozygous R84L mutation
(607199.0015) in a Japanese family with variable expression of
popliteal-pterygium syndrome. Mutations in the same codon, R84C and
R84H, have been reported in other patients with PPS (Kondo et al.,
2002), suggesting a hotspot for recurrent mutations.

- Van der Woude Syndrome-Popliteal Pterygium Syndrome Spectrum

De Medeiros et al. (2008) described a patient, conceived by in vitro
fertilization, with unilateral cleft lip and palate, ankyloblepharon,
paramedian lip pits, unilateral renal aplasia, and a coronal
hypospadias, with a novel heterozygous mutation (607199.0013) in the
IRF6 gene. The authors considered the patient to have a VWS-PPS spectrum
disorder. They were uncertain whether renal aplasia was related to the
mutation or the method of fertilization.

- Orofacial Cleft 6

Zucchero et al. (2004) found overtransmission of the ancestral allele of
the V274I polymorphism (dbSNP rs2235371), originally identified by Kondo
et al. (2002), to patients with nonsyndromic cleft lip and palate (OFC6;
608864) who were Asian but did not find it in groups of European
descent. Zucchero et al. (2004) noted that their findings suggested that
the V allele itself was not causal.

Rahimov et al. (2008) used multispecies sequence comparison to identify
a common SNP (dbSNP rs642961, G-A) in an IRF6 enhancer located in the
intergenic region between the start sites of the oppositely transcribed
IRF6 and C1ORF107 genes (genome coordinate 208,055,893; build 36.3) They
found that the A allele was significantly overtransmitted (p = 1 x
10(-11)) in families with nonsyndromic cleft lip/palate (OFC6; 608864),
particularly in those with cleft lip only. EMSA and CHIP assays
demonstrated that the risk allele disrupts the binding site of
transcription factor AP-2-alpha (TFAP2A; 107580), and expression
analysis in the mouse localized the enhancer activity to craniofacial
and limb structures. In luciferase reported assays in a human foreskin
keratinocyte cell line, the risk haplotype consistently increased the
luciferase expression more than the nonassociated haplotypes did, but
the difference did not reach statistical significance. Rahimov et al.
(2008) concluded that IRF6 and TFAP2A are in the same developmental
pathway and that this high frequency variant in a regulatory element
contributes substantially to a common, complex disorder.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Clefts of the lip with or without cleft palate and isolated cleft palate
are developmentally and genetically distinct (see 119520 and 119540,
respectively), yet VWS is a single-gene disorder that encompasses both
clefting phenotypes. To verify this point, Kondo et al. (2002) analyzed
22 pedigrees that had a single mutation in IRF6 and individuals with
both phenotypes. Genotype analysis of 1 family demonstrated that
affected individuals, regardless of their phenotype, shared the 18-bp
deletion (607199.0002) that occurred in the proband. They observed
similar results in the other families and concluded that a single
mutation in IRF6 can cause both types of clefting. Protein-truncation
mutations were significantly more common in VWS than in PPS (P = 0.004).
The lone exception was a nonsense mutation present in 1 family, glu393
to ter (607199.0003), which may be a dominant-negative mutation.

Kondo et al. (2002) found that missense mutations that cause VWS were
almost evenly divided between the DNA-binding domain and the
protein-binding domain, whereas most missense mutations that cause PPS
were found in the DNA-binding domain. Comparison of the positions of PPS
mutations with the crystal structure of the IRF1 DNA-binding domain
showed that every amino acid residue that was mutant in individuals with
PPS directly contacts the DNA, whereas only 1 of 7 of the residues
mutant in individuals with VWS contacts the DNA. Most notably, Kondo et
al. (2002) observed missense mutations involving the arg84 codon in 7
unrelated PPS families. The arg84 residue is comparable to the arg82
residue of IRF1. Variation in the phenotypic effects of mutations in the
IRF6 gene causing VWS and PPS suggested the operation of stochastic
factors or modifier genes influencing IRF6 function. Three sorts of
variation were observed. Thirty-two families had multiple combinations
of orofacial anomalies, 22 families had mixed clefting phenotypes
(individuals with cleft lip and individuals with cleft palate only in
the same family), and 4 families affected with PPS included individuals
who exhibited orofacial (VWS) features exclusively. Kondo et al. (2002)
identified a sequence variant, val274 to ile, occurring within an
absolutely conserved residue within the SMIR domain. This variant is
common in unaffected populations (3% in European-descended and 22% in
Asian populations) and was considered by them an attractive candidate
for a modifier of VWS, PPS, and other orofacial clefting disorders.

ANIMAL MODEL

The epidermis is a highly organized structure, the integrity of which is
central to the protection of an organism. Development and subsequent
maintenance of this tissue depends critically on the intricate balance
between proliferation and differentiation of a resident stem cell
population. Richardson et al. (2006) undertook a study of the signals
controlling the proliferation-differentiation switch in vivo. They
showed that mice carrying a homozygous missense mutation in Irf6, the
homolog of the gene mutated in the human congenital disorders van der
Woude syndrome and popliteal pterygium syndrome, have a
hyperproliferative epidermis that fails to undergo terminal
differentiation, resulting in soft tissue fusions. They further
demonstrated that mice compound heterozygous for mutations in Irf6 and
the gene encoding the cell cycle regulator protein stratifin (SFN;
601290) show similar defects of keratinizing epithelia. The results
indicated that Irf6 is a key determinant of the keratinocyte
proliferation-differentiation switch and that Irf6 and Sfn interact
genetically in this process.

Ingraham et al. (2006) obtained Irf6-null mice at the expected mendelian
ratio. At embryonic day 17.5, Irf6-null mice had taut, shiny skin,
lacked external ears, and had snouts and jaws shorter and more rounded
than their wildtype littermates. Irf6-null embryos also had short
forelimbs that lacked visible digits and a single caudal projection that
lacked visible hindlimbs and tail. Histologic and gene expression
analyses showed that the primary defect was in keratinocyte
differentiation and proliferation. Ingraham et al. (2006) found that
abnormalities of epithelial differentiation that resulted in cleft
palate were a consequence of adhesion between the palatal shelves and
the tongue in both Irf6-null and homozygous missense mice.

Richardson et al. (2009) showed that Irf6/Jag2 (602570) doubly
heterozygous mice displayed a fully penetrant intraoral epithelial
adhesions, resulting in cleft palate. There was no evidence of direct
interaction between Irf6 and Jag2, suggesting that the mechanism
underlying the genetic interaction between Irf6 and Jag2 is the
consequence of their combined effects on periderm formation,
maintenance, and function. Notch1 (190198) and p63 (603273) expression
patterns in Irf6/Jag2 doubly heterozygous mouse embryos suggested that
Irf6 affects Jag2-Notch1 signaling during periderm maintenance.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
VAN DER WOUDE SYNDROME 1
IRF6, GLU92TER

In the affected twin of a pair of monozygotic twins who were discordant
for van der Woude syndrome (VWS1; 119300), Kondo et al. (2002) found a
nonsense mutation in exon 4 of the IRF6 gene that was absent in both
parents and the unaffected twin: glu92 to ter (E92X).

.0002
VAN DER WOUDE SYNDROME 1
IRF6, 18-BP DEL/1-BP INS

In affected members of a family with van der Woude syndrome (119300),
Kondo et al. (2002) identified heterozygosity for an 18-bp deletion and
insertion of a single adenine occurring after nucleotide 870 of the IRF6
gene. Some affected members had cleft of the lip with cleft palate,
others had cleft of the lip without cleft palate, and yet others had
isolated cleft plate; regardless of the phenotype, all shared the 18-bp
deletion found in the proband.

.0003
POPLITEAL PTERYGIUM SYNDROME
IRF6, GLN393TER

Kondo et al. (2002) found that protein-truncation mutations of the IRF6
gene were significantly more common in van der Woude syndrome (VWS;
119300) than in popliteal pterygium syndrome (PPS; 119500) (P = 0.004).
The lone exception to this relationship was a nonsense mutation
introducing a stop codon in place of a glutamine codon at position 393
(Q393X), which may be a dominant-negative mutation, found in affected
members of a PPS family.

.0004
POPLITEAL PTERYGIUM SYNDROME
IRF6, ARG84CYS

In affected members of 5 unrelated families with popliteal pterygium
syndrome (119500), Kondo et al. (2002) identified heterozygosity for a
250C-T transition in the IRF6 gene resulting in an arg84-to-cys (R84C)
change in the protein. In affected members of 2 other PPS families,
arg84 was changed to a different amino acid (607199.0005).

.0005
POPLITEAL PTERYGIUM SYNDROME
IRF6, ARG84HIS

In affected members of 2 unrelated families with PPS (119500), Kondo et
al. (2002) found an arg84-to-his (R84H) missense mutation in the IRF6
gene. The arg84 residue, affected in the arg84-to-cys (607199.0004) and
arg84-to-his missense mutations, is 1 of 4 residues that make critical
contacts with the core sequence, GAAA, and is essential for the DNA
binding function of IRF6.

.0006
VAN DER WOUDE SYNDROME 1
IRF6, ALA2VAL

Wang et al. (2003) screened 4 Chinese families with van der Woude
syndrome (119300) in 9 exons and their flanking splice junctions of the
IRF6 gene by direct sequencing. They identified 3 missense mutations,
including ala2-to-val (A2V), resulting from a 268C-T nucleotide change.
The A2V mutation had been reported previously in an American family by
Kondo et al. (2002).

.0007
VAN DER WOUDE SYNDROME 1
IRF6, ARG6CYS

An arg6-to-cys (R6C) substitution in the IRF6 gene (279C-T in exon 3)
was found by Wang et al. (2003) in a Chinese family with van der Woude
syndrome (119300).

.0008
VAN DER WOUDE SYNDROME 1
IRF6, TRP379TER

In a Chinese family with van der Woude syndrome (119300), Wang et al.
(2003) found a nonsense mutation in the IRF6 gene: a TGG-to-TGA
(1400G-A) transition at codon 379 of exon 8, introducing a premature
stop codon in place of a tryptophan residue (W379X).

.0009
VAN DER WOUDE SYNDROME 1
IRF6, ARG400TRP

In a Chinese family with van der Woude syndrome (119300), Wang et al.
(2003) found that affected members were carrying a missense mutation in
the IRF6 gene: a 1461C-T transition in exon 9, predicting a tryptophan
substitution for a highly conserved arginine at codon 400 (R400W).

.0010
VAN DER WOUDE SYNDROME 1
IRF6, 17-BP DEL

In a Japanese family with van der Woude syndrome (119300), Kayano et al.
(2003) found a 17-kb deletion in the IRF6 gene. On initial sequencing no
base change was found, but a deletion involving exons 4-9 was suggested
by multiplex PCR analysis. Further analyses revealed a heterozygous
17,162-bp deletion involving exons 4-9. Kayano et al. (2003) suggested
that since IRF6 mutations in a significant portion of VWS patients
remain undetected by conventional sequencing analysis, it may be
important to search for a large deletion in such patients.

.0011
VAN DER WOUDE SYNDROME 1
IRF6, ARG45GLN

In a Japanese family with van der Woude syndrome (119300), Kayano et al.
(2003) found a G-to-A substitution at nucleotide 134 in exon 3 of the
IRF6 gene that resulted in an arg45-to-gln (R45Q) amino acid change.

.0012
VAN DER WOUDE SYNDROME 1
IRF6, PRO396SER

In a Japanese family with van der Woude syndrome (119300), Kayano et al.
(2003) found a C-to-T substitution at nucleotide 1186 in exon 9 of the
IRF6 gene that resulted in a pro396-to-ser (P396S) amino acid change.

.0013
VAN DER WOUDE SYNDROME 1
POPLITEAL PTERYGIUM SYNDROME, INCLUDED
IRF6, ARG339ILE

In a patient with overlapping features of van der Woude syndrome
(119300) and popliteal pterygium syndrome (119500) (unilateral cleft lip
and palate, ankyloblepharon, paramedian lip pits) as well as unilateral
renal aplasia and coronal hypospadias, de Medeiros et al. (2008)
identified heterozygosity for a 1016G-T transversion in the IRF6 gene,
resulting in an arg339-to-ile (R339I) substitution. The mutation was not
found in 60 unrelated control individuals. The patient and his brother,
who had hypospadias and nephrocalcinosis but no IRF6 mutation, were both
conceived by in vitro fertilization. De Medeiros et al. (2008) suggested
that the hypospadias and renal aplasia may have been due to the method
of fertilization rather than the IRF6 mutation. They noted that a lethal
PPS syndrome (263650) has renal aplasia as a feature.

.0014
VAN DER WOUDE SYNDROME 1
POPLITEAL PTERYGIUM SYNDROME, INCLUDED
IRF6, LEU22PRO

In affected individuals from a 4-generation family with van der Woude
syndrome (VWS1; 119300), Ghassibe et al. (2004) identified
heterozygosity for a 65T-C transition in exon 3 of the IRF6 gene,
resulting in a leu22-to-pro (L22P) substitution in the DNA-binding
domain. In addition to lip pits and clefting, 2 of the patients also had
syndactyly and synechiae, major signs for popliteal-pterygium syndrome
(PPS; 119500). Ghassibe et al. (2004) stated that these 2 patients were
considered to have PPS, whereas the 6 other affected family members were
classified as VWS, thus demonstrating that a single mutation could be
responsible for both syndromes.

.0015
POPLITEAL PTERYGIUM SYNDROME
IRF6, ARG84LEU

In a Japanese boy with popliteal-pterygium syndrome (119500), Matsuzawa
et al. (2010) identified a heterozygous 251G-T transversion in exon 4 of
the IRF6 gene, resulting in an arg84-to-leu (R84L) substitution in a
critical site for DNA binding. The boy had lip pits, bilateral cleft lip
and palate, syngnathia, syndactyly, popliteal webbing, and atrophic
testes. His father, who also carried the mutation, had bilateral cleft
lip and palate only. Family history revealed a paternal grandfather and
aunt with bifid uvula and cleft palate. Thus, variable expressivity was
clinically evident in this family. The mutation was not detected in the
mother or in 90 healthy Japanese controls. The R84C (607199.0004) and
R84H (607199.0005) mutations in the same codon were previously reported
by Kondo et al. (2002) in other patients with PPS, suggesting a hotspot
for recurrent mutations.

.0016
POPLITEAL PTERYGIUM SYNDROME
IRF6, SER424LEU

In a Japanese boy and his mother with PPS (119500), Matsuzawa et al.
(2010) identified a heterozygous 1271C-T transition in exon 9 of the
IRF6 gene, resulting in a ser424-to-leu (S424L) substitution. The
mutation was not found in 200 Japanese controls. In vitro functional
expression studies showed that the mutant protein had 6% residual
activity, consistent with a loss of function. The boy had cleft palate,
syngnathia, unclear scrotum, syndactyly, and mild popliteal webbing,
whereas his mother had cleft lip and palate, syngnathia, syndactyly, and
hypoplasia of the labia majora.

.0017
VAN DER WOUDE SYNDROME 1
IRF6, GLN49TER

In a 16-year-old girl with a heart-shaped mass on her inner lower lip
(VWS1; 119300) but no pits, oral clefts, or hypodontia, Yeetong et al.
(2009) identified heterozygosity for a 145C-T transition in exon 3 of
the IRF6 gene, resulting in a gln49-to-ter (Q49X) substitution in the
highly conserved DNA-binding domain. Her mother and other relatives were
reported to have similar findings, but were unavailable for evaluation.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The 3 RAS oncogenes, HRAS, KRAS (190070), and NRAS (164790), encode
21-kD proteins called p21s.

Wong-Staal et al. (1981) identified human DNA sequences homologous to
cloned DNA fragments containing the oncogenic nucleic acid sequences of
a type C mammalian retrovirus, the Harvey strain of murine sarcoma virus
(HaMSV) derived from the rat. Non-onc intervening sequences were present
in the human counterpart, which is rather highly conserved in mammalian
evolution and probably plays a role in normal cell growth or
differentiation. Allelic variation in the human onc HaMSV gene was
identified. The transforming genes of retroviruses are derived from a
group of cellular genes that are highly conserved evolutionarily. The
relationship between viral transforming genes (collectively called
v-onc) and their normal cellular counterparts (collectively called
c-onc) is obviously of great scientific and medical interest. Chang et
al. (1982) studied the Harvey and Kirsten murine sarcoma viruses, 2
closely related rat-derived transforming retroviruses called v-Ha-ras
and v-Ki-ras, respectively. They concluded that the human genome
contains several copies of the c-ras gene family and that c-Ha-ras-1
(with intervening sequences) (HRAS1) has been more highly conserved than
has c-Ha-ras-2 (HRAS2; 300437).

MAPPING

By Southern blot analysis of human-rodent hybrid cell DNA, de
Martinville et al. (1983) found that the cellular homolog of the
transforming DNA sequence isolated from the bladder carcinoma line EJ is
located on the short arm of chromosome 11. The locus also contains
sequences homologous to the Harvey ras oncogene. No evidence of gene
amplification was found. These workers also found karyologically 'a
complex rearrangement of the short arm in two of the four copies of
chromosome 11 present in this heteroploid cell line' (EJ). Region 11p15
was the site of a breakpoint in a t(3;11) translocation found in tumor
cells from a patient with hereditary renal cell carcinoma (144700).

By in situ molecular hybridization studies of meiotic chromosomes
(pachytene bivalents), Jhanwar et al. (1983) found that KRAS and HRAS
probes mapped to chromomeres corresponding to bands 11p14.1, 12p12.1,
and 12q24.2 of somatic chromosomes. HRAS hybridized most avidly at
11p14.1. A weak hybridization at 3p21.3 was noted.

By somatic cell hybridization, Junien et al. (1984) found that HRAS1
maps to 11p15.5-p15.1. The HRAS1 and insulin (INS; 176730) genes appear
to be closely situated in the 11pter area; Gerhard et al. (1984) found a
maximum lod score of 4.1 at theta = 0.0 for the HRAS1 and INS linkage.
Two obligatory recombinants were found. These findings are consistent
with the observation that the HRAS gene is not deleted in cases of Wilms
tumor with deleted 11p13 (Junien et al., 1984). De Martinville and
Francke (1984) likewise mapped HRAS1 and INS, and beta-globin (HBB;
141900) as well, outside the 11p14.1-p11.2 segment.

Fisher et al. (1984) concluded that HRAS1 is distal to the INS and HBB
loci on 11p. Fearon et al. (1984) demonstrated that HRAS1 is 8 cM distal
to the HBB gene and 4 cM proximal to the INS gene. The HBB gene is about
7 cM distal to the parathyroid hormone gene (PTH; 168450). The length of
11p is estimated to be about 50 cM.

By high resolution in situ hybridization to meiotic pachytene
chromosomes, Chaganti et al. (1985) concluded that HRAS1 is located at
11p14.1, HBB at 11p11.22, PTH (not previously assigned regionally) at
11p11.21, and INS at 11p14.1.

Russell et al. (1996) constructed a contiguous physical map from the
HRAS1 gene to the 11p telomere. The contig spanned approximately 500 kb.
Three genes were placed on the contig in the following order: tel--RNH
(173320)--HRAS1--HRC (142705).

Bianchi et al. (1993) mapped the H-ras-1 gene to the beta-globin region
of mouse chromosome 7.

GENE FUNCTION

Goyette et al. (1983) found that the number of transcripts of the Harvey
ras gene increases during liver regeneration in rats. This appeared to
indicate regulated change in activity of an 'oncogene' in a physiologic
growth process.

Ishii et al. (1985) pointed out similarities between the promoter of
HRAS and that of EGF receptor (131550). This similarity is intriguing in
light of the finding of Hiwasa et al. (1988) that the preferential
degradation of EGF receptors by cathepsin L (116880) may be suppressed
by HRAS gene products (p21s).

Sears et al. (1999) showed that RAS enhances the accumulation of MYC
(190080) activity by stabilizing the MYC protein. Whereas MYC has a very
short half-life when produced in the absence of mitogenic signals, due
to degradation by the 26S proteasome, the half-life of MYC increases
markedly in growth-stimulated cells. This stabilization is dependent on
the RAS/RAF/MAPK (see 176948) pathway and is not augmented by proteasome
inhibition, suggesting that RAS inhibits the proteasome-dependent
degradation of MYC. Sears et al. (1999) proposed that one aspect of
MYC-RAS collaboration is an ability of RAS to enhance the accumulation
of transcriptionally active MYC protein.

Hahn et al. (1999) found that ectopic expression of TERT (187270) in
combination with 2 oncogenes, the simian virus 40 large-T oncoprotein
and an oncogenic allele of HRAS (HRASV12), resulted in direct
tumorigenic conversion of normal human epithelial and fibroblast cells.
These results demonstrated that disruption of the intracellular pathways
regulated by large-T, oncogenic RAS, and telomerase suffices to create a
human tumor cell.

Mochizuki et al. (2001) used fluorescent resonance energy transfer
(FRET)-based sensors to evaluate the spatiotemporal images of growth
factor-induced activation of RAS and RAP1 (179520). Epidermal growth
factor (131530) activated RAS at the peripheral plasma membrane and RAP1
at the intracellular perinuclear region of COS-1 cells. In PC12 cells,
nerve growth factor (see 162030)-induced activation of RAS was initiated
at the plasma membrane and transmitted to the whole cell body. After 3
hours, high RAS activity was observed at the extending neurites. By
using the FRAP (fluorescence recovery after photobleaching) technique,
Mochizuki et al. (2001) found that RAS at the neurites turned over
rapidly; therefore, the sustained RAS activity at neurites was due to
high GTP/GDP exchange rate and/or low GTPase activity, but not to the
retention of the active RAS. While previous biochemical analyses rarely
detected more than 40% activation of RAS upon growth factor stimulation,
Mochizuki et al. (2001) concluded that their data show that growth
factor stimulation strongly activates RAS/RAP1 in a very restricted area
within cells, and that a large population of RAS or RAP1 remains
inactive, causing an apparent low-level response in biochemical assays.

Zhu et al. (2002) examined the small GTPases RAS and RAP in the
postsynaptic signaling underlying synaptic plasticity. They showed that
RAS relays the NMDA receptor (see 138252) and
calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (see 114078) signaling
that drives synaptic delivery of AMPA receptors (see 138248) during
long-term potentiation. In contrast, RAP was found to mediate the NMDA
receptor-dependent removal of synaptic AMPA receptors that occurs during
long-term depression. The authors determined that RAS and RAP exert
their effects on AMPA receptors that contain different subunit
composition. Thus, RAS and RAP, whose activities can be controlled by
postsynaptic enzymes, serve as independent regulators for potentiating
and depressing central synapses.

Oft et al. (2002) found that activation of Smad2 (601366) induced
migration of mouse squamous carcinoma cells, but that elevated levels of
H-ras were required for nuclear accumulation of Smad2. Elevated levels
of both were required for induction of spindle-cell transformation and
metastasis.

Weijzen et al. (2002) demonstrated that oncogenic Ras activates Notch
(190198) signaling and that wildtype Notch1 is necessary to maintain the
neoplastic phenotype in Ras-transformed human cells in vitro and in
vivo. Oncogenic Ras increases levels and activity of the intracellular
form of wildtype Notch1, and upregulates Notch1 ligand Delta1 (606582)
and also presenilin-1 (104311), a protein involved in Notch processing,
through a p38 (600289)-mediated pathway. Weijzen et al. (2002) concluded
that their observations placed Notch signaling among key downstream
effectors of oncogenic Ras.

Because therapeutics inhibiting RAS and NFKB (see 164011) pathways are
used to treat human cancer, experiments assessing the effects of
altering these regulators have been performed in mice. The medical
relevance of murine studies is limited, however, by differences between
mouse and human skin, and by the greater ease of transforming murine
cells. To study RAS and NFKB in a setting more relevant to human
tumorigenesis, Dajee et al. (2003) expressed the active HRAS
gly12-to-val mutation (190020.0001), NFKB p65 (164014), and a stable
NFKB repressor mutant of IKBA (164008) in human skin tissue. Primary
human keratinocytes were retrovirally transduced and used to regenerate
human skin on immune-deficient mice. Tissue expressing IKBA alone showed
mild hyperplasia, whereas expression of oncogenic RAS induced growth
arrest with graft failure. Although implicated in promoting features of
neoplasia in other settings, the coexpression of oncogenic RAS with NFKB
subunits failed to support proliferation. Coexpression of RAS and IKBA
produced large neoplasms with deep invasion through fat into underlying
muscle and fascia, similar to human squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), in 3
weeks. These tumors showed more than 10-fold increase in mitotic index,
preserved telomeres, and increased amounts of TERT (187270) protein.
Human keratinocytes lacking laminin-5 (LAMB3; 150310) and ITGB4 (147557)
failed to form tumors on coexpression with RAS and IKBA; however,
introduction of wildtype LAMB3 and ITGB4 restored tumor-forming
capacity, suggesting that these 2 proteins are required for SCC
tumorigenesis. Dajee et al. (2003) demonstrated that growth arrest
triggered by oncogenic RAS can be bypassed by IKBA-mediated blockade of
NFKB and that RAS opposed the increased susceptibility to apoptosis
caused by NFKB blockade. Thus, IKBA circumvents restraints on growth
promotion induced by oncogenic RAS and can act with RAS to induce
invasive human tissue neoplasia.

Johnson et al. (2005) found that the 3 human RAS genes, HRAS, KRAS, and
NRAS, contain multiple let-7 (605386) complementary sites in their
3-prime UTRs that allow let-7 miRNA to regulate their expression. Let-7
expression was lower in lung tumors than in normal lung tissue, whereas
expression of the RAS proteins was significantly higher in lung tumors,
suggesting a possible mechanism for let-7 in cancer.

Substitution of ser17 with asn (S17N) in any of the RAS proteins
produces dominant-inhibitory proteins with higher affinities for
exchange factors than normal RAS. These mutants cannot interact with
downstream effectors and therefore form unproductive complexes,
preventing activation of endogenous RAS. Using experiments in COS-7
cells, mouse fibroblasts, and canine kidney cells, Matallanas et al.
(2003) found that the Hras, Kras, and Nras S17N mutants exhibited
distinct inhibitory effects that appeared to be due largely to their
specific membrane localizations. The authors demonstrated that Hras is
present in caveolae, lipid rafts, and bulk disordered membranes, whereas
Kras and Nras are present primarily in disordered membranes and lipid
rafts, respectively. Thus, the Hras S17N mutant inhibited activation of
all 3 wildtype RAS isoforms, the Kras S17N mutant inhibited wildtype
Kras and the portion of Hras in disordered membranes, and the Nras S17N
mutant inhibited wildtype Nras and the portion of Hras in lipid rafts.

Rocks et al. (2005) showed that the specific subcellular distribution of
HRAS and NRAS guanosine triphosphate-binding proteins is generated by a
constitutive de/reacylation cycle that operates on palmitoylated
proteins, driving their rapid exchange between the plasma membrane and
the Golgi apparatus. Depalmitoylation redistributes farnesylated Ras in
all membranes, followed by repalmitoylation and trapping of Ras at the
Golgi, from where it is redirected to the plasma membrane via the
secretory pathway. This continuous cycle prevents Ras from nonspecific
residence on endomembranes, thereby maintaining the specific
intracellular compartmentalization. Rocks et al. (2005) found that the
de/reacylation cycle also initiates Ras activation at the Golgi by
transport of plasma membrane-localized Ras guanosine triphosphate.
Different de/repalmitoylation kinetics account for isoform-specific
activation responses to growth factors.

Ancrile et al. (2007) found that expression of an oncogenic form of HRAS
induced secretion of the cytokine IL6 (147620) in normal primary human
kidney cells, fibroblasts, myoblasts, and mammary epithelial cells.
Knockdown of IL6, genetic ablation of the Il6 gene in mice, or treatment
with IL6-neutralizing antibody retarded HRAS-driven tumorigenesis. IL6
appeared to act in a paracrine fashion to promote angiogenesis and tumor
growth.

Stites et al. (2007) developed and validated a mathematical model of Ras
signaling. The model-based predictions and associated experiments help
explain why only 1 of 2 classes of activating Ras point mutations with
in vitro transformation potential is commonly found in cancers.
Model-based analysis of these mutants uncovered a systems-level process
that contributes to total Ras activation in cells. This predicted
behavior was supported by experimental observations. Stites et al.
(2007) also used the model to identify a strategy in which a drug could
cause stronger inhibition on the cancerous Ras network than on the
wildtype network.

McMurray et al. (2008) showed that a large proportion of genes
controlled synergistically by loss-of-function p53 (TP53; 191170) and
Ras activation are critical to the malignant state of murine and human
colon cells. Notably, 14 of 24 'cooperation response genes' were found
to contribute to tumor formation in gene perturbation experiments. In
contrast, only 1 of 14 perturbations of the genes responding in a
nonsynergistic manner had a similar effect. McMurray et al. (2008)
concluded that synergistic control of gene expression by oncogenic
mutations thus emerges as an underlying key to malignancy, and provides
an attractive rationale for identifying intervention targets in gene
networks downstream of oncogenic gain- and loss-of-function mutations.

Lu et al. (2008) found that conditional activation of HRAS1(Q61L) in
embryonic stem cells in vitro induced the trophectoderm marker Cdx2
(600297) and enabled derivation of trophoblast stem cell lines that,
when injected into blastocysts, chimerized placental tissues. Erk2
(176948), the downstream effector of Ras-MAPK signaling, was
asymmetrically expressed in the apical membranes of the 8-cell-stage
embryo just before morula compaction. Inhibition of MAPK signaling in
cultured mouse embryos compromised Cdx2 expression, delayed blastocyst
development, and reduced trophectoderm outgrowth from embryo explants.
Lu et al. (2008) concluded that ectopic Ras activation can divert
embryonic stem cells toward extraembryonic trophoblastic fates and that
Ras-MAPK signaling has a role in promoting trophectoderm formation from
mouse embryos.

Gough et al. (2009) reported that malignant transformation by activated
Ras (190020.0001) is impaired without STAT3 (102582), in spite of the
inability of Ras to drive STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation or nuclear
translocation. Moreover, STAT3 mutants that cannot be
tyrosine-phosphorylated, that are retained in the cytoplasm, or that
cannot bind DNA nonetheless supported Ras-mediated transformation.
Unexpectedly, STAT3 was detected within mitochondria, and exclusive
targeting of STAT3 to mitochondria without nuclear accumulation
facilitated Ras transformation. Mitochondrial STAT3 sustained altered
glycolytic and oxidative phosphorylation activities characteristic of
cancer cells. Thus, Gough et al. (2009) concluded that, in addition to
its nuclear transcriptional role, STAT3 regulates a metabolic function
in mitochondria, supporting Ras-dependent malignant transformation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Somatic Mutations in Tumors

Der et al. (1982) found that mouse cells transformed by high molecular
weight DNAs of a human bladder and a human lung carcinoma cell line
contained new sequences homologous, respectively, to the transforming
genes of Harvey (ras-H) and Kirsten (ras-K) sarcoma viruses. The HRAS1
oncogene differs from its normal cellular counterpart by the absence of
a restriction endonuclease site. This sequence change could be used as
the basis of a rapid screening method for this oncogene. Muschel et al.
(1983) screened DNA from 34 persons and found that all were homozygous
for the normal allele. On the other hand, DNA from a patient's bladder
tumor, as well as DNA from his normal bladder and leukocytes, was
heterozygous at that restriction endonuclease site. The change was
pinpointed to 1 of 2 nucleotides, either of which would change the
twelfth amino acid (glycine) in the normal HRAS1 gene product. Thus, the
patient appeared to be carrying an HRAS1 mutation in his germline that
predisposed him to bladder cancer. The restriction enzyme used in the
screen was HpaII or its isoschizomer MspI. However, the authors
retracted their data that purported to show an HRAS1 mutation in both
tumor tissue and normal tissue; they concluded that the original
extractions of DNA from that patient were contaminated by a plasmid DNA
containing the HRAS1 oncogene. By restriction analysis, Feinberg et al.
(1983) tested 29 human cancers for this mutation and found it in none.
Included were 10 primary bladder cancers, 9 colon cancers, and 10 lung
cancers. The point mutation altering the twelfth amino acid of the HRAS1
gene product p21, found in a bladder cancer cell line, was the only one
known to result in a human transforming gene (see 190020.0001).

Capon et al. (1983) showed that the HRAS1 gene of the T24 human bladder
carcinoma line has at least 4 exons and that only a single point
mutation in the first exon distinguished the coding region of both
alleles of the normal gene from their activated counterpart. Both
versions of the gene encode a protein which is predicted to differ from
the corresponding viral gene product at 3 amino acid residues, one of
which was previously shown to represent the major site of
phosphorylation of the viral polypeptide. Pincus et al. (1983) concluded
that the bladder oncogene peptide (product of the mutant HRAS1 gene),
with valine rather than glycine at position 12 (190020.0001), has a
3-dimensional structure markedly different from the normal. Tong et al.
(1989) determined the structural change in the HRAS gene (called RASH by
them) resulting from replacement of glycine 12 by valine.

Sekiya et al. (1984) found a point mutation in the second exon of the
HRAS1 gene in a melanoma. Transversion from adenine to thymine resulted
in the substitution of leucine for glutamine as amino acid 61 in the
predicted p21 protein.

In 2 of 38 urinary tract tumors, Fujita et al. (1985) detected HRAS
oncogenes by transfection, cloned the oncogene in biologically active
form, and showed that it contained single base changes at codon 61
leading to substitutions of arginine and leucine, respectively, for
glutamine at this position. In 1 tumor, a 40-fold amplification of KRAS
was found. In the cell lines isolated from a single colon cancer,
Greenhalgh and Kinsella (1985) found a point mutation in codon 12 of
HRAS leading to an amino acid change in the gene product. The authors
cited experience with KRAS involvement in 3 colon cancers and NRAS
involvement in 1, while some 34 other colon cancers failed to
demonstrate HRAS activation at codon 12.

Goriely et al. (2009) screened 30 spermatocytic seminomas (see 273300)
for oncogenic mutations in 17 candidate genes and identified apparent
homozygosity for 5 mutations in the HRAS gene (190020), 3 182A-G
transitions and 2 181C-A transversions, all involving the Q61 codon
(see, e.g., 190020.0002).

Yokota et al. (1986) concluded that alterations are found in oncogenes
MYC (190080), HRAS, or MYB (189990) in more than one-third of human
solid tumors. Amplification of MYC was found in advanced widespread
tumors and in aggressive primary tumors. Apparent allelic deletions of
HRAS and MYB could be correlated with progression and metastasis of
carcinomas and sarcomas.

Corell and Zoll (1988) used the restriction enzymes MspI, HpaII, BamHI,
and TaqI to analyze 426 alleles of the HRAS locus in DNA samples from 92
healthy individuals, 50 patients with breast cancer, 23 patients with
ovarian cancer, and 5 patients with lymphomas. The allelic distribution
was comparable among controls and tumor patients, indicating that a
genetic predisposition to malignancy is not conferred by unique alleles
at the HRAS locus. However, analysis of DNA isolated directly from
tumors revealed a discrepancy between the alleles in the white blood
cells and those in the tumor tissue. Six patients demonstrated alleles
in the tumor tissue which were not observed in DNA from the white blood
cells.

In a study of 118 lung cancer patients and 123 unaffected controls,
Ryberg et al. (1990) found striking differences in the distribution of
HRAS alleles. Six of 7 rare alleles were unique to the lung cancer group
and 1 rare allele for the control group; rare alleles were found in 10
of 236 chromosomes in lung cancer patients as compared to 1 of 246
chromosomes in the controls. The lung cancer group also had a
significantly lower frequency of 1 of the common alleles. The authors
emphasized the importance of control for ethnic factors and the
advantage in studying a relatively homogeneous population such as the
Norwegian one.

The HRAS1 gene is tightly linked to a minisatellite located
approximately 1 kb downstream from the gene's coding sequences and
composed of 30 to 100 units of a 28-bp consensus sequence. Thirty
alleles of 1,000 to 3,000 bp have been described. The 4 most common
alleles--A1, A2, A3, and A4--represent 94% of all alleles in whites and
have apparently served as progenitors for the remaining rare alleles.
Rare alleles appear in the genomes of patients with cancer about 3 times
as often as in controls without cancer (Krontiris et al., 1985); many
such alleles have been observed only in patients with cancer. Krontiris
et al. (1993) conducted a case-control study, typing 736 HRAS1 alleles
from patients with cancer and 652 from controls by Southern blotting of
leukocyte DNA. From analysis of the results and a meta-analysis of 22
other studies, they concluded that there was a significant association
of rare HRAS1 alleles with 4 types of cancer: carcinomas of the breast,
colorectum, and urinary bladder and acute leukemia. They considered it
unlikely that the explanation could be found in linkage disequilibrium
between these rare alleles and a pathogenetic lesion in the HRAS1 locus
or other neighboring loci. Alternatively, they pointed to observations
that new mutations of the HRAS1 minisatellite disrupt the controlled
expression of nearby genes, including HRAS1, by interacting directly
with transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. Furthermore, the
minisatellite is capable of activating and repressing transcription;
allele-specific effects have been observed.

Phelan et al. (1996) demonstrated a modifier effect of the HRAS1 locus
on the penetrance of the BRCA1 gene (113705) in causing ovarian cancer.
The polymorphism in question, a VNTR located 1 kb downstream of the
HRAS1 gene, had previously been found to show an association between
rare alleles and an increased risk of certain types of cancers,
including breast cancer. The risk for ovarian cancer was 2.11 times
greater for BRCA1 carriers harboring 1 or 2 rare HRAS1 alleles, compared
to carriers with only common alleles (P = 0.015). A magnitude of the
risk associated with a rare HRAS1 allele was not altered by adjusting
for the other known risk factors for hereditary ovarian cancer. This
study was said to have been the first to show the effect of a modifying
gene on the penetrance of an inherited cancer syndrome.

Groesser et al. (2012) analyzed tissue from 65 individuals with nevus
sebaceous (see 162900) for the presence of HRAS hotspot mutations. HRAS
mutations were present in 62 lesions (95%), with a G13R substitution
(190020.0017) accounting for 91%. Five sebaceous nevi carried 2 RAS
mutations; the other gene involved was KRAS. Nonlesional tissue from 18
patients showed a wildtype HRAS sequence. Eight individuals developed
secondary tumors within the nevus sebaceous, including 2
syringocystadenoma papilliferum, 3 trichoblastomas, and 3
trichilemmomas, and all secondary tumors carried the same mutation as
the nevi. Functional analysis of mutant cells carrying the G13R mutation
showed constitutive activation of the MAPK and PI3K (see 171834)/AKT
(164730) signaling pathways. Other somatic HRAS mutations identified
included G12S (190020.0003), G12D (190020.0013), and G12C (190020.0014).
One patient with Schimmelpenning-Feuerstein-Mims syndrome (163200) was
found by Groesser et al. (2012) to carry the G13R mutation in the
somatic mosaic state. The authors postulated that the mosaic mutation
likely extends to extracutaneous tissues in that disorder, which could
explain the phenotypic pleiotropy.

Hafner et al. (2012) found somatic activating RAS mutations in 28 (39%)
of 72 keratinocytic epidermal nevi from 72 different individuals. HRAS
was the most commonly mutated gene, found in 29% of all nevi, with G13R
(190020.0017) being the most common mutation.

- Genotype/Phenotype Correlations among Somatic HRAS, KRAS,
and NRAS Mutations

In HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS, codons 12 and 61 are 'hotspots' for mutations
that activate their malignant transforming properties. Srivastava et al.
(1985) showed that mutation at these 3 loci result in changes in
electrophoretic mobility of the p21. Changes observed are, for the HRAS
gene, gly12 to val (bladder carcinoma), gly12 to asp (mammary
carcinosarcoma), gln61 to leu (lung carcinoma), and gln61 to arg (renal
pelvic carcinoma) and for the NRAS oncogene, gln61 to arg (lung
carcinoma). They proposed that the electrophoretic changes may be a
rapid method for identification of activated RAS genes, substituting for
the inherently insensitive and time-consuming transfection assay.

Vasko et al. (2003) performed a pooled analysis of 269 mutations in
HRAS, KRAS (190070), and NRAS (164790) garnered from 39 previous
studies. Mutations proved significantly less frequent when detected with
direct sequencing than without (12.3% vs 17%). The rates of mutation
involving NRAS exon 1 and KRAS exon 2 was less than 1%. Mutations of
codon 61 of NRAS were significantly more frequent in follicular tumors
(19%) than in papillary cancers (5%) and significantly more frequent in
malignant (25%) than in benign (14%) tumors. HRAS mutations in codons
12/13 were found in 2 to 3% of all types of tumors, but HRAS mutations
in codon 61 were observed in only 1.4% of tumors, and almost all of them
were malignant. KRAS mutations in exon 1 were found more often in
papillary than follicular cancers (2.7% vs 1.6%) and were sometimes
correlated with special epidemiologic circumstances. The second part of
this study involved analysis of 80 follicular tumors from patients
living in Marseille (France) and Kiev (Ukraine). HRAS mutations in
codons 12/13 were found in 12.5% of common adenomas and 1 follicular
carcinoma (2.9%). Mutations of codon 61 of NRAS occurred in 23.3% and
17.6% of atypical adenomas and follicular carcinomas, respectively. The
authors concluded that their results confirmed the predominance of
mutations of codon 61 of NRAS in thyroid follicular tumors and their
correlation with malignancy.

Nikiforova et al. (2003) analyzed a series of 88 conventional follicular
and Hurthle cell thyroid tumors for RAS (HRAS, NRAS, and KRAS) mutations
and PAX8 (167415)-PPARG (601487) rearrangements using molecular methods
and for galectin-3 (153619) and mesothelioma antibody HBME-1 expression
by immunohistochemistry. Forty-nine percent of conventional follicular
carcinomas had RAS mutations, 36% had PAX8-PPARG rearrangement, and only
1 (3%) had both. Of follicular adenomas, 48% had RAS mutations, 4% had
PAX8-PPARG rearrangement, and 48% had neither. Follicular carcinomas
with RAS mutations most often displayed an
HBME-1-positive/galectin-3-negative immunophenotype and were either
minimally or overtly invasive. Hurthle cell tumors infrequently had
PAX8-PPARG rearrangement or RAS mutations.

- Costello Syndrome

Costello syndrome (218040), a multiple congenital anomaly and mental
retardation syndrome, overlaps phenotypically with Noonan syndrome
(163950), which is caused by mutation in the PTPN11 gene (176876) in
approximately 50% of cases. The PTPN11 gene encodes tyrosine phosphatase
SHP2; gain-of-function mutant SHP2 proteins identified in Noonan
syndrome have enhanced phosphatase activity, which results in activation
of a RAS-MAPK cascade in a cell-specific manner. Aoki et al. (2005)
hypothesized that genes mutated in Costello syndrome and in
PTPN11-negative Noonan syndrome encode molecules that function upstream
or downstream of SHP2 in signal pathways. Among these molecules, they
sequenced the entire coding region of 4 RAS genes in genomic DNA from 13
individuals with Costello syndrome and 28 individuals with
PTPN11-negative Noonan syndrome. In 12 of the 13 individuals with
Costello syndrome, they found one or another of 4 heterozygous mutations
in HRAS. These mutations had been identified somatically in various
tumors (Bos, 1989). Mutation analysis of genomic DNA from 2 different
tissues in 3 affected individuals and genomic DNA from parents in 4
families indicated that these 'oncogenic' and germline mutations
occurred de novo. No mutations in KRAS, NRAS (164790), HRAS, or ERAS
(300437) were observed in 28 individuals with Noonan syndrome or in 1
individual with Costello syndrome. Aoki et al. (2005) stated that to the
best of their knowledge, Costello syndrome was the first disorder
associated with germline mutations in the RAS family of GTPases. The
observations suggested that germline mutations in HRAS perturb human
development and increase susceptibility to tumors.

Kerr et al. (2006) analyzed the HRAS gene in 43 patients with a clinical
diagnosis of Costello syndrome and identified mutations in 37 (86%);
G12S (190020.0003) was the most common mutation, found in 30 of the 37
mutation-positive patients. The authors stated that, together with
previously published series (Aoki et al., 2005 and Gripp et al., 2006),
mutations in HRAS had been found in 82 (85%) of 96 patients with a
clinical diagnosis of Costello syndrome and that overall the frequency
of malignancy in the published mutation-positive cases was 11%.

Costello syndrome can be caused by heterozygous de novo missense
mutations affecting the codon for glycine-12 or glycine-13 of the HRAS
gene. Sol-Church et al. (2006) identified 39 Costello syndrome patients
harboring the gly12-to-ser mutation (190020.0003), the gly12-to-ala
substitution (190020.0004), and 1 patient with the gly13-to-cys
substitution (190020.0007). They conducted a search of the region
flanking the mutated sites in 42 probands and 59 parents, and used 4
polymorphic markers to trace the parental origin of the germline
mutations. One of the SNPs, dbSNP rs12628 (81T-C), was found in strong
linkage disequilibrium with a highly polymorphic hexanucleotide (GGGCCT)
repeat region. Of a total of 24 probands with polymorphic markers, 16
informative families were tested and a paternal origin of the germline
mutation was found in 14 Costello syndrome probands. This distribution
was consistent neither with an equal likelihood of mutations arising in
either parent (P = 0.0018), nor with exclusive paternal origin.

Zampino et al. (2007) identified the common G12S mutation in 8 of 9
unrelated patients with Costello syndrome; the ninth child had a
different mutation (190020.0008). All mutations were de novo, paternally
inherited, and associated with advanced paternal age. None of 36
patients with Noonan syndrome or 4 with cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome
(CFCS; 115150) had a mutation in the HRAS gene.

Lo et al. (2008) described 4 infants with an unusually severe Costello
syndrome phenotype and 3 different mutations in the HRAS gene: the
common G12S mutation (190020.0003) was seen in 1 case, 2 cases had a
G12D mutation (190020.0013), and 1 case had a G12C mutation
(190020.0014).

Gremer et al. (2010) reported 2 different 3-nucleotide duplications in
the first coding exon of the HRAS gene (exon 2) resulting in a
duplication of glutamate-37 (E37dup) associated with a phenotype
reminiscent of Costello syndrome. None of the parents carried the
mutations. The phenotype of the 2 affected individuals was remarkably
similar and characterized by severe mental retardation and pronounced
short stature in one (190020.0015) and relatively mild involvement of
the musculoskeletal system compared with the classical Costello syndrome
phenotype in the other (190020.0016). Ectopic expression of HRAS(E37dup)
in COS-7 cells resulted in enhanced growth factor-dependent stimulation
of the MEK-ERK (see MEK1, 176872) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K;
601232)-AKT (164730) signaling pathways. Recombinant HRAS(E37dup) was
characterized by slightly increased GTP/GDP dissociation, lower
intrinsic GTPase activity, and complete resistance to neurofibromin-1
GTPase-activating protein (NF1; 613113) stimulation due to dramatically
reduced binding. Coprecipitation of GTP-bound HRAS(E37dup) by various
effector proteins, however, was inefficient because of drastically
diminished binding affinities. Thus, although HRAS(E37dup) was
predominantly present in the active, GTP-bound state, it promoted only a
weak hyperactivation of downstream signaling pathways. The authors
proposed that the mildly enhanced signal flux through the MAPK and
PI3K-AKT cascades promoted by these disease-causing germline HRAS
alleles may result from a balancing effect between a profound GAP
insensitivity and inefficient binding to effector proteins.

- Congenital Myopathy with Excess Muscle Spindles

Van der Burgt et al. (2007) identified mutations in the HRAS gene
(190020.0001; 190020.0003; 190020.0009; 190020.0010) in patients with
congenital myopathy with excess muscle spindles, a variant of Costello
syndrome.

ANIMAL MODEL

Schuhmacher et al. (2008) generated a mouse model of Costello syndrome
by introduction of an oncogenic gly12-to-val mutation (190020.0001) in
the mouse Hras gene. Mutant mice developed hyperplasia of the mammary
gland, but tumor development was rare. The mice showed some phenotypic
features similar to those in patients with Costello syndrome, including
facial dysmorphism and cardiomyopathy. Mutant mice also developed
systemic hypertension, extensive vascular remodeling, and fibrosis in
both the heart and the kidneys resulting from abnormal upregulation of
the renin-angiotensin II system, which responded to treatment with
captopril. Histologic studies with a tagged wildtype Hras gene showed
expression in most murine embryonic tissues and several adult tissues,
including the heart, aortic vascular smooth muscle cells, kidney,
mammary glands, skin epithelium, urinary bladder, colon, and brain.

Using an Hras knockin mouse model, To et al. (2008) demonstrated that
specificity for Kras (190070) mutations in lung and Hras mutations in
skin tumors is determined by local regulatory elements in the target Ras
genes. Although the Kras 4A isoform is dispensable for mouse
development, it is the most important isoform for lung carcinogenesis in
vivo and for the inhibitory effect of wildtype Kras on the mutant
allele. Kras 4A expression is detected in a subpopulation of normal lung
epithelial cells, but at very low levels in lung tumors, suggesting that
it may not be required for tumor progression. The 2 Kras isoforms
undergo different posttranslational modifications. To et al. (2008)
concluded that their findings may have implications for the design of
therapeutic strategies for inhibiting oncogenic Kras activity in human
cancers.

Di Micco et al. (2006) showed that senescence triggered by the expansion
of an activated oncogene, HRAS V12, in normal human cells is a
consequence of the activation of a robust DNA-damage checkpoint
response. Experimental inactivation of this response abrogated
oncogene-induced senescence and promoted cell transformation. DNA damage
checkpoint response and oncogene-induced senescence were established
after a hyperreplicative phase occurring immediately after oncogene
expression. Senescent cells arrested with partly replicated DNA and with
DNA replication origins having fired multiple times. In vivo DNA
labeling and molecular DNA combing revealed that oncogene activation
leads to augmented numbers of active replicons and to alterations in DNA
replication fork progression. Di Micco et al. (2006) also showed that
oncogene expression does not trigger a DNA damage checkpoint response in
the absence of DNA replication. Last, Di Micco et al. (2006) showed that
oncogene activation was associated with DNA damage checkpoint response
activation in a mouse model in vivo. Di Micco et al. (2006) proposed
that oncogene-induced senescence results from the enforcement of a DNA
damage checkpoint response triggered by oncogene-induced DNA
hyperreplication.

Somatic Mutations

Taparowsky et al. (1982) found that the HRAS1 gene cloned from a human
bladder cancer cell line (T24) transformed NIH 3T3 cells, while the same
gene cloned from normal cellular DNA did not. Furthermore, they showed
that the change in the transforming gene was a single nucleotide
substitution that produced change of a single amino acid in the sequence
of the protein that the gene encodes. They suggested that antibodies
against Ras proteins might be diagnostic for certain forms of cancer.
The T24 gene had a change from GGC (glycine) to GTC (valine) as codon
12. Fearon et al. (1985) examined constitutional and tumor genotypes at
loci on the short arm of chromosome 11 in 12 patients with transitional
cell carcinomas of the bladder. In 5 they found loss of genes in the
tumor, resulting in homozygosity or hemizygosity of the remaining
allele. This frequency (42%) approached that seen in Wilms tumor (55%).

The G12V mutant of HRAS had the lowest GTPase activity among various
substitutions at codon 12 (Colby et al., 1986), and biologic assays by
focus formation in NIH3T3 cells or soft agar growth showed that this
substitution had the highest transformation potential among
substitutions tested at this codon (Seeburg et al., 1984, Fasano et al.,
1984). Aoki et al. (2005) noted that among codon 12 HRAS mutations found
somatically in human cancers, G12V is the predominant mutation.

Hafner et al. (2012) identified a somatic G12V mutation in 1 of 72
keratinocytic epidermal nevi (162900).

Costello Syndrome

In a Japanese patient with Costello syndrome (218040), Aoki et al.
(2005) found a germline 35GC-TT nucleotide substitution in the HRAS gene
that resulted in a gly12-to-val amino acid change (G12V). This
individual died of severe cardiomyopathy at 18 months of age.

Congenital Myopathy with Excess of Muscle Spindles

Van der Burgt et al. (2007) identified a heterozygous G12V mutation in
the HRAS gene in a patient with congenital myopathy with excess of
muscle spindles (see 218040), a variant of Costello syndrome. The
patient, originally reported by de Boode et al. (1996), died at age 3
weeks. He was a preterm infant with generalized hypotonia and
progressive hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.

follicular carcinomas (see 188470), 2 follicular adenomas, and 1 Hurthle
cell adenoma, accounting for 12%, 18%, and 100% of each tumor type
examined, respectively.

Goriely et al. (2009) screened 30 spermatocytic seminomas (see 273300)
for mutations in 17 candidate genes, and in 2 tumors they identified
apparent homozygosity for a C-A transversion in the HRAS gene that
resulted in the Q61K substitution.

Costello Syndrome

In 3 Japanese and in 4 Italian patients with Costello syndrome (218040),
Aoki et al. (2005) identified a germline 34G-A transition in the HRAS
gene that caused a gly12-to-ser (G12S) amino acid substitution.

Kerr et al. (2006) analyzed the HRAS gene in 43 patients with a clinical
diagnosis of Costello syndrome and identified mutations in 37 (86%);
G12S was the most common mutation, found in 30 of the 37
mutation-positive patients.

Zampino et al. (2007) identified the G12S mutation in 8 of 9 unrelated
patients with Costello syndrome. By analyzing the flanking genomic
region, the authors determined that all patients had de novo mutations
inherited from the father. There was an advanced age at conception in
affected fathers transmitting the mutation. The phenotype was
homogeneous.

In a male infant with severe Costello syndrome, Lo et al. (2008)
identified the G12S mutation in the HRAS gene. The patient had
persistent neonatal hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, right ventricular
hypertrophy, and enlarged kidneys. He required pyloromyotomy for pyloric
stenosis and inguinal hernia repair at age 3 months. He had complex
upper and lower airway obstruction with a floppy tongue, narrow
subglottic opening, and tracheobronchomalacia, requiring a tracheostomy
with intermittent ventilatory support. Deterioration of his respiratory
function led to the discovery of a pulmonary rhabdomyosarcoma, and he
died at 2.25 years of age.

Congenital Myopathy with Excess of Muscle Spindles

Van der Burgt et al. (2007) identified a heterozygous G12S mutation in
the HRAS gene in a patient with congenital myopathy with excess of
muscle spindles (see 218040), a phenotypic variant of Costello syndrome.
The patient, originally reported by Selcen et al. (2001), died at age 14
months of cardiorespiratory failure. He had generalized muscle weakness,
areflexia, joint contractures, and clubfeet.

Epidermal Nevus and Urothelial Cancer

Hafner et al. (2011) reported a 49-year-old man who had widespread
mosaicism for a G12S mutation present in tissues derived from endoderm,
ectoderm, and mesoderm, suggesting an embryonic mutation. The patient
presented at 49 years of age with widespread congenital epidermal nevus
(162900). At 19 years of age a urothelial cell carcinoma was detected in
the bladder, and 2 new tumors were identified at 48 years of age. At age
49 a single metastatic lesion was identified in lung.

.0006
COSTELLO SYNDROME
HRAS, LYS117ARG

In a 9-year-old girl with Costello syndrome (218040), Kerr et al. (2006)
identified a de novo 350A-G transition in the HRAS gene, resulting in a
lys117-to-arg (K117R) substitution. The patient's physical phenotype was
unusual in that she had microretrognathism and both her plantar and
palmar creases were less pronounced than usually seen in Costello
syndrome. Her behavioral phenotype included autistic traits with verbal
stereotypies and hand biting. Otherwise she had classic features of
Costello syndrome with cardiac involvement (cardiomyopathy and
ventricular septal defect) but no neurologic malformation. The mutation
was not found in either of her parents.

Denayer et al. (2008) identified a de novo K117R mutation in a
6-year-old girl with typical Costello syndrome. Behavioral features
included moderate mental retardation with a friendly personality and no
autistic features. In vitro functional expression studies showed
increased levels of phosphorylated proteins consistent with constitutive
activation of the RAS/MAPK pathways. Recombinant K117R showed normal
intrinsic GTP hydrolysis and responsiveness to GTPase-activating
proteins, but the nucleotide disassociation rate was increased 80-fold.
Crystal structure data indicated an altered interaction pattern of the
side chain that was associated with unfavorable nucleotide binding
properties.

COSTELLO SYNDROME
HRAS, GLY13CYS

Sol-Church et al. (2006) found that 1 of 42 patients with Costello
syndrome (218040) and heterozygous de novo missense mutations involving
either glycine-12 or -13 of the HRAS gene carried a gly13-to-cys (G13C)
substitution (37G-A).

Piccione et al. (2009) reported a premature male infant born at 29
weeks' gestation due to fetal distress who was found to have Costello
syndrome due to the G13C mutation. The characteristic facial features
were not apparent until about 4 months of age, when he was noted to have
relative macrocephaly, coarse face with hypertelorism, downslanting
palpebral fissures, epicanthal folds, prominent eyes, short nose,
low-set ears, large mouth, short neck, loose skin of hands and feet,
sparse hair, hyperpigmented skin, deep palmar creases, joint laxity,
reduced subcutaneous adipose tissue, and bilateral cryptorchidism. At 11
months of age, he had delayed motor development with central hypotonia,
but adequate mental and speech development. Papillomata were not
present. Piccione et al. (2009) noted that the distinctive features of
Costello syndrome may be absent during the first months of life,
especially in preterm infants who often have failure to thrive and
decreased subcutaneous adipose tissue. The striking facial features of
the disorder become more evident after the critical neonatal period.

Gripp et al. (2011) examined 12 individuals with Costello syndrome due
to the G13C mutation and compared the phenotype to those with the G12S
(190020.0003) mutation. Individuals with G13C had many typical findings
including polyhydramnios, failure to thrive, hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy, macrocephaly, posterior fossa crowding, and
developmental delay. Their facial features were less coarse and short
stature was less severe. Statistically significant differences included
the absence of several common features, including multifocal atrial
tachycardia, ulnar deviation of the wrist, and papillomata; a noteworthy
absence of malignant tumors did not reach statistical significance.
There were some novel ectodermal findings associated with the G13C
mutation, including loose anagen hair and long eyelashes requiring
trimming (termed 'dolichocilia').

.0008
COSTELLO SYNDROME
HRAS, ALA146THR

In 1 of 9 unrelated patients with Costello syndrome (218040), Zampino et
al. (2007) identified a de novo 436G-A transition in the HRAS gene,
resulting in an ala146-to-thr (A146T) substitution The mutation was of
paternal origin. The patient had unusual features, including normal
neonatal growth, microcephaly, normal ears, and thin, but not curly,
hair. Crystallographic information indicated that the A146T substitution
occurs in a hydrophobic pocket involved in binding to the purine ring of
GTP/GDP and likely destabilizes the binding of GTP and GDP. Since GTP
has a higher cytoplasmic concentration and would therefore be more
likely to bind to the protein, the A146T mutation may result in a gain
of function.

MYOPATHY, CONGENITAL, WITH EXCESS OF MUSCLE SPINDLES
HRAS, GLU63LYS

In a 7-month-old girl with congenital myopathy with excess of muscle

al. (2007) identified a heterozygous 187G-A transition in the HRAS gene,
resulting in a glu63-to-lys (E63K) substitution. The patient, originally
reported by Stassou et al. (2005), had hypertrophic obstructive

al. (2007) identified a heterozygous 64C-A transversion in the HRAS
gene, resulting in a gln22-to-lys (Q22K) substitution. The patient had
mild hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, generalized hypotonia, delayed motor

resulting in a thr58-to-ile (T58I) substitution in a highly conserved
residue in the switch II region of small GTPases. Neither parent carried
the mutation, which was present on the paternal allele. At the time of
birth, the father and mother were 45 and 34 years old, respectively. The
facial features of the patient were less coarse than typical Costello
syndrome, but he showed other typical features, including failure to
thrive, cognitive impairment, lax skin, deep palmar creases, and pyloric
stenosis.

In a girl with Costello syndrome (218040), Gripp et al. (2008)
identified a heterozygous 437C-T transition in exon 4 of the HRAS gene,
resulting in an ala146-to-val (A146V) substitution. The facial features
of the patient were less coarse than usually seen in Costello syndrome,
but she also showed other typical features, including hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy, deep palmar creases, and delayed development. Another
HRAS mutation resulting in Costello syndrome has been reported in this
codon (A146T; 190020.0008).

COSTELLO SYNDROME, SEVERE
NEVUS SEBACEOUS, SOMATIC, INCLUDED
HRAS, GLY12ASP

In 2 infants with severe Costello syndrome (218040) including neonatal
hypoglycemia and respiratory failure, Lo et al. (2008) identified 35G-A
transition in the HRAS gene, resulting in a gly12-to-asp (G12D)
substitution. One infant had paroxysmal multifocal atrial tachycardia,
atrial septal defect, and septal hypertrophy, as well as persistent
respiratory distress with tracheobronchomalacia, recurrent pneumothorax,
pneumonia, and chylothorax, and died at age 3 months due to respiratory
failure; postmortem lung histology showed findings consistent with
lymphangiectasia and alveolar/capillary dysplasia. The other infant had
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and dysplastic pulmonary valve noted at day
1, and developed atrial fibrillation and heart failure at day 35; she
had persistent hyponatremia due to renal sodium leakage with signs of
renal failure at 6 weeks. She became ventilator dependent and died at 3
months of age from sepsis and renal failure.

Kuniba et al. (2009) reported a Japanese fetus with severe Costello
syndrome due to the G12D mutation. He was diagnosed using prenatal
3-dimensional ultrasonography at 23 weeks' gestation. Findings at that
time included polyhydramnios, severe overgrowth (+5.3 SD using a
Japanese fetal growth curve), and dysmorphic craniofacial features, such
as large head, pointed chin, wide nasal bridge, and low-set ears. In
addition, the wrists showed lateral deviation and flexion. After birth,
he developed respiratory failure, severe hypoglycemia, cardiac
hypertrophy, and renal failure, and died soon after birth. The phenotype
was similar to that reported by Lo et al. (2008) in 2 infants with the
G12D mutation, suggesting that this mutation is associated with a severe
clinical outcome and death in early infancy.

Groesser et al. (2012) identified a somatic G12D mutation in 1 (2%) of
65 nevus sebaceous tumors (see 162900).

HRAS, GLY12CYS

In a male infant with severe Costello syndrome (218040), Lo et al.
(2008) identified a 34G-T transversion in the HRAS gene, resulting in a
gly12-to-cys (G12C) substitution. The patient developed respiratory
distress after delivery and required intubation and ventilatory support
secondary to small lungs and upper airway obstruction. He had an atrial
tachyarrhythmia with apparent thickening of the myocardial wall and
redundant mitral valve tissue on echocardiogram, and had echogenic
kidneys with thick-walled pelvises on ultrasound. He died at 3 months of
age due to respiratory failure.

Groesser et al. (2012) identified a somatic G12C mutation in 1 (2%) of
65 nevus sebaceous tumors (see 162900).

Hafner et al. (2012) identified a somatic G12C mutation in 1 of 72
keratinocytic epidermal nevi (162900).

COSTELLO SYNDROME
HRAS, 3-BP DUP, 110AGG

In a 5-year-old Kurdish male with a phenotype reminiscent of Costello
syndrome (218040), Gremer et al. (2010) detected a heterozygous 3-bp
duplication in exon 2 of the HRAS gene that resulted in duplication of
glutamic acid at position 37 (110_111+1dupAGG, glu37dup). The child had
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, global developmental delay, growth
retardation, coarse facial features, and sparse hair. Mental retardation
was severe, with no speech development. Neither parent carried the
mutation. The authors also identified another patient with a similar
phenotype who also carried a duplication of glu37 caused by a different
3-nucleotide duplication (190020.0016).

.0016
COSTELLO SYNDROME
HRAS, 3-BP DUP, 108AGA

In a 6-year-old Italian boy with a phenotype reminiscent of Costello
syndrome (218040), Gremer et al. (2010) detected a heterozygous 3-bp
duplication in exon 2 of the HRAS gene that resulted in duplication of
glutamic acid at position 37 (108_110dupAGA, glu37dup). The patient had
global developmental delay, growth retardation, coarse facial features,
sparse hair, and a thickened ventricular septum. Language was absent.
Neither of his parents carried the mutation. Another duplication of
glu37 was identified in another patient (190020.0015).

.0017
NEVUS SEBACEOUS, SOMATIC
SCHIMMELPENNING-FEUERSTEIN-MIMS SYNDROME, SOMATIC MOSAIC, INCLUDED;;
EPIDERMAL NEVUS, SOMATIC, INCLUDED
HRAS, GLY13ARG

In 59 (91%) of 65 different nevus sebaceous (see 162900) tumors,
Groesser et al. (2012) identified a somatic 37G-C transversion in the
HRAS gene, resulting in a gly13-to-arg (G13R) substitution. Two of the
tumors also carried a somatic mutation in the KRAS gene (190070.0005 and
190070.0006, respectively), and 1 tumor had 2 HRAS mutations: G13R and
G12S (190020.0003). Nonlesional tissue from 18 individuals with the G13R
mutation showed the wildtype HRAS allele. Eight individuals developed
secondary tumors within the nevus sebaceous, including 2
syringocystadenoma papilliferum, 3 trichoblastomas, and 3
trichilemmomas, and all secondary tumors carried the same mutation as
the nevi, suggesting that they arose from cells of the nevus sebaceous.
Functional analysis of mutant cells carrying the G13R mutation showed
constitutive activation of the MAPK and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways.

Hafner et al. (2012) identified a somatic G13R mutation in 21 of 24
HRAS-mutant keratinocytic epidermal nevi (162900), making it the most
common mutation among a larger series of 72 nevi.

One patient with Schimmelpenning-Feuerstein-Mims syndrome (163200) was
found by Groesser et al. (2012) to carry the G13R mutation in somatic
mosaic state. This patient had originally been reported by Zutt et al.
(2003). She was a 52-year-old woman who was noted at birth to have a
large, right-sided nevus sebaceous extending to her head, neck, arm, and
trunk. The scalp was also involved, resulting in alopecia. The patient
developed recurrent syringocystadenoma papilliferum and basal cell
carcinoma within the nevus. Other features included generalized growth
retardation, hypophosphatemic rickets, and precocious puberty.
Intelligence was normal. There was no family history of a similar
disorder.

606015	TITLE *606015 FAS APOPTOTIC INHIBITORY MOLECULE 3; FAIM3
;;TOSO;;
Fc FRAGMENT OF IgM, RECEPTOR FOR; FCMR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Fc receptors specifically bind to the Fc region of immunoglobulins (Igs)
to mediate the unique functions of each Ig class. FAIM3 encodes an Fc
receptor for IgM (see 147020) (Kubagawa et al., 2009; Shima et al.,
2010).

CLONING

Using retroviral cDNA library-based functional cloning, Hitoshi et al.
(1998) isolated a cDNA encoding a potent inhibitor of FAS
(134637)-induced apoptotic signaling that they named TOSO after a
Japanese liquor drunk on New Year's day to celebrate long life and
eternal youth. The predicted 390-amino acid type I integral membrane
protein has a signal peptide; an extracellular region homologous to
immunoglobulin (Ig) variable domains, but with 2 additional cysteines;
and a cytoplasmic region containing a basic region, an acidic region,
and a proline-rich region. RNA dot blot analysis detected strong
expression of TOSO in lymph node, lung, and kidney. Northern blot
analysis detected a major 2.0-kb TOSO transcript, as well as minor
transcripts of 2.8, 3.5, and 4.3 kb, in lymph node, spleen, peripheral
blood leukocytes, and thymus. RT-PCR analysis detected TOSO expression
in lymphoid cell lines, but not in nonhemopoietic cell lines.

By retroviral expression and functional cloning using cDNA libraries
from a chronic lymphocytic leukemia line and from a pre-B cell line,
followed by screening for IgM (see 147020) binding and flow cytometric
enrichment, Kubagawa et al. (2009) obtained a cDNA encoding FAIM3, which
they called FCMR. SDS-PAGE, RT-PCR, and FACS analyses showed that FCMR
had an apparent molecular mass of 60 kD and was predominantly expressed
on B and T lymphocytes.

By searching EST databases for molecules containing Ig domains similar
to those of FCAMR (605484) and PIGR (173880), Shima et al. (2010)
identified FAIM3, which they called FCMR, as a possible Fc receptor for
IgM. Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses revealed FCMR expression
predominantly in lymphocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

FAS engagement by FAS ligand (FASL; 134638) activates cysteine
proteases, or caspases, through an association with FADD (602457),
resulting in cell death. Newly activated T cells, however, express both
FAS and FASL, but remain resistant to apoptosis. Using Northern blot
analysis, Hitoshi et al. (1998) demonstrated that expression of TOSO,
like that of FAS and FASL, increased after T-cell activation, followed
by a decline and susceptibility to apoptosis. Functional analysis showed
that hematopoietic cells expressing TOSO resisted anti-FAS-, FADD-, and
TNF-induced apoptosis without increasing expression of the inhibitors of
apoptosis BCL2 (151430) and BCLXL (600039). RT-PCR analysis indicated
that cells expressing TOSO and activated by FAS had reduced FLICE
(CASP8; 601763) and increased FLIP (CFLAR; 603599) expression, which
inhibited CASP8 processing. Mutational analysis established that the Ig
domain and transmembrane region of TOSO, but not the cytoplasmic domain,
were required for the inhibition of FAS-induced apoptosis. Hitoshi et
al. (1998) concluded that the transient increase in TOSO expression is
responsible for temporary FAS resistance in T cells.

Through functional analysis, Kubagawa et al. (2009) confirmed that FCMR
had binding specificity for IgM, but not other immunoglobulins, and that
only under some conditions did FCMR have antiapoptotic activity.
Kubagawa et al. (2009) concluded that FCMR per se has no inhibitory
activity in FAS-mediated apoptosis, and that such inhibition can only be
achieved with anti-FAS antibodies of IgM, but not IgG (see 147100),
isotype.

Shima et al. (2010) found that transfection of FCMR into HeLa cells
allowed IgM, but not IgG, binding. They concluded that FCMR is a
receptor for IgM that may serve as an uptake receptor for IgM-opsonized
antigens by B cells.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Hitoshi et al. (1998) mapped the FAIM3
gene to chromosome 1q31-q32, a region with frequent changes in
hemopoietic malignancies and solid tumors. Kubagawa et al. (2009) noted
that the FAIM3 gene is located on chromosome 1q32.2, adjacent to 2 other
genes encoding IgM-binding receptors, PIGR and FCAMR.

607391	TITLE *607391 SINGLE-STRANDED DNA-BINDING PROTEIN 4; SSBP4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By EST database searching with the SSBP2 (607389) sequence as probe,
Castro et al. (2002) identified 2 additional members of the SSBP gene
family, SSBP3 (607390) and SSBP4. All 3 SSBP genes share homology with
the chicken gene CSDP, which encodes a protein that binds
single-stranded pyrimidine-rich mirror-repeat elements with high
specificity. The deduced 364-amino acid SSBP4 protein shares 73% and 72%
sequence identity with human SSBP2 and SSBP3, respectively. SSBP family
members share a highly conserved N terminus followed by a glycine- and
proline-rich domain.

GENE STRUCTURE

Castro et al. (2002) determined that the SSBP2, SSBP3, and SSBP4 genes
all contain 17 exons and have identical intron/exon boundaries,
suggesting duplication from a common ancestral gene. They also
identified alternative splicing and additional internal exons for all 3
genes, suggesting the existence of multiple isoforms for each protein.
The SSBP4 gene spans less than 25 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Castro et al. (2002) mapped the SSBP4 gene
to chromosome 19p13.1, between markers D19S899 and D19S407.

613994	TITLE *613994 NEUROBLASTOMA BREAKPOINT FAMILY, MEMBER 4; NBPF4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NBPF4 is a member of the NBPF gene family, which consists of 22 genes
and pseudogenes that arose by gene duplication. NBPF genes contain
numerous low-copy repetitive elements and show high intergenic and
intragenic sequence identity in coding and noncoding regions (Vandepoele
et al., 2005).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to NBPF1 (610501),
Vandepoele et al. (2005) identified NBPF4.

GENE STRUCTURE

Vandepoele et al. (2005) determined that the NBPF4 gene contains 14
coding exons, 1 of which results from an internal duplication. NBPF4
lacks a LINE repeat insert present in other NBPF genes.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis and FISH, Vandepoele et al. (2005) mapped
the NBPF4 gene to an NBPF gene cluster on chromosome 1p12.

194538	TITLE *194538 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 10; ZNF10
;;KOX1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using the zinc finger region of mouse Mkr1 (Zfp1) to screen a human
T-cell line cDNA library, Thiesen (1990) cloned ZNF10, which he called
KOX1. The deduced 462-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass
of at least 50 kD. It has 11 consecutive zinc fingers containing
conserved cys/his residues, with variations in fingers 1 and 11.
Northern blot analysis showed variable KOX1 expression in several human
cell lines, with highest expression in the U937 myelomonocytic cell
line. Several KOX1 transcripts were detected, suggesting it may be
alternatively spliced.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a zinc blot, Thiesen (1990) demonstrated that KOX1 specifically
bound zinc.

MAPPING

In the course of mapping 27 nonoverlapping zinc finger cDNAs from human
T cells by analysis of somatic cell hybrids, Huebner et al. (1991)
mapped ZNF10 to chromosome 12q13-qter, probably clustered with ZNF26
(194537). Rousseau-Merck et al. (1993) also mapped the ZNF10 gene to
chromosome 12q24.33 and demonstrated that it and ZNF26 are located
within a pulsed field gel electrophoresis fragment less than 300 kb
long. The mapping was done by a combination of somatic cell
hybridization and in situ hybridization. Since ZNF26 has been mapped to
12q24.33 by in situ hybridization, this also must be the localization of
ZNF10.

609585	TITLE *609585 COMPLEXIN 3; CPLX3
;;CPX III
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching genomic databases for CPX-like sequences, followed by PCR
of a brain cDNA library, Reim et al. (2005) cloned CPLX3, which they
designated CPX III. The deduced 158-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 17.6 kD. CPX III contains a C-terminal CAAX box motif
for posttranslational prenylation. CPX III shares more than 91% amino
acid identity with mouse Cpx III. Northern blot analysis of several
mouse and rat tissues detected Cpx III only in retina. EST database
analysis indicated mouse Cpx III is expressed in brain and eye. In situ
hybridization of mouse brain sections detected Cpx III in pyramidal
cells of the hippocampus, granule cells of dentate gyrus and cerebellum,
and Purkinje cells of cerebellum. Western blot analysis detected Cpx III
in several rat brain regions. Cpx III associated with cytosolic and
membrane synaptic fractions of fractionated rat cortex.
Immunohistochemical analysis of mouse retina detected Cpx III in ribbon
and conventional synapses of rods and cones.

GENE FUNCTION

Reim et al. (2005) found that recombinant mouse Cpx III bound syntaxin-1
(STX1A; 186590), Snap25 (600322), and synaptobrevin (see VAMP1; 185880)
in rat brain synaptosomes, and it bound syntaxin-3 (STX3A; 600876) in
rat retinal extracts. Farnesylation of Cpx III at the C-terminal CAAX
motif was required to target Cpx III to membranes of transfected cells.
Cpx III was a positive regulator of neurotransmitter release in mouse
hippocampal neurons, but farnesylation of Cpx III had little impact on
its function.

;;N-ACETYLGALACTOSAMINE-4-O-SULFOTRANSFERASE 1;;
GalNAc4 SULFOTRANSFERASE 1; GalNAc4ST1;;
GalNAc4ST
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Sulfate groups in carbohydrates confer highly specific functions on
glycoproteins, glycolipids, and proteoglycans and are critical for
cell-cell interaction, signal transduction, and embryonic development.
Sulfotransferases, such as CHST8, carry out sulfation of carbohydrates
(Hiraoka et al., 2001).

CLONING

By searching for sequences similar to the C-terminal region of rat
Hnk1st (CHST10; 606376), followed by RACE of a fetal brain cDNA library,
Xia et al. (2000) cloned CHST8, which they designated GalNAc4ST1. The
deduced 424-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 48.8
kD. It has an N-terminal transmembrane domain, followed by putative
5-prime-phosphosulfonate- and 3-prime-phosphate-binding sites and 3
additional regions conserved in other sulfotransferases. GalNAc4ST1 has
4 potential N-glycosylation sites. Xia et al. (2000) also identified a
GalNAc4ST1 isoform beginning with met119 that lacks the transmembrane
domain. A second soluble GalNAc4ST1 form, derived by proteolytic
cleavage of the transmembrane region, was secreted by transfected
Chinese hamster ovary cells. Northern blot analysis showed a prominent
2.4-kb transcript in brain. Lower expression was detected in liver,
heart, and pancreas, and very low expression was detected in skeletal
muscle. RNA dot blot analysis confirmed high expression of GalNAc4ST1 in
the central nervous system, particularly in pituitary gland, cerebellum,
pons, medulla oblongata, thalamus, and spinal cord. Fetal brain also
showed high expression.

Okuda et al. (2000) and Hiraoka et al. (2001) independently cloned human
CHST8 from fetal brain and pituitary gland cDNA libraries, respectively.
By Northern blot analysis, Hiraoka et al. (2001) detected a transcript
of 2.4 kb expressed at high levels in fetal and adult brain and in
spinal cord. Moderate expression was detected in adult liver, kidney,
and heart. Skeletal muscle expressed a transcript of 1.0 kb. RT-PCR
detected high expression in pituitary gland.

GENE FUNCTION

Xia et al. (2000) assayed GalNAc4ST1 sulfotransferase activity in
lysates of transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells. Membrane-bound
GalNAc4ST1 transferred sulfate to the C4 hydroxyl of terminal
beta-1,4-linked GalNAc residues in GalNAc-beta-1,4-GlcNAc-beta-R. It
sulfated bovine parotid carbonic anhydrase VI (CA6; 114780) and bovine
luteinizing hormone (LH; see 152780), but not chondroitin. In contrast,
the 2 truncated soluble forms of GalNAc4ST1 sulfated both
GalNAc-beta-1,4-GlcNAc-beta-R and chondroitin. The results suggested
that the first 118 amino acids of GalNAc4ST1 determine substrate
specificity.

Okuda et al. (2000) found that human GalNAc4ST expressed by COS-7 cells
sulfated carbonic anhydrase VI and synthetic p-nitrophenyl GalNAc, but
not chondroitin or desulfated dermatan sulfate.

Hiraoka et al. (2001) confirmed that GalNAc4ST1 transferred sulfate to
C4 of GalNAc in the context of GalNAc-beta-1,4-GlcNAc-beta-1-R in both
N- and O-glycans; products were monosulfated.

GENE STRUCTURE

Xia et al. (2000) determined that the CHST8 gene contains 4 exons and
spans about 88 kb. Exon 1 is noncoding.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Xia et al. (2000) mapped the CHST8 gene to
chromosome 19q13.1.

ANIMAL MODEL

Luteinizing hormone (LH) bears a unique N-linked N-acetylgalactosamine
that mediates the clearance of LH from blood, and GalNAc4ST1 is
responsible for sulfate addition to GalNAc on LH. Mi et al. (2008) found
that Chst8 -/- mice exhibited increased levels of circulating LH. Mutant
male mice had elevated levels of testosterone and precocious maturation
of testis and seminal vesicles. Mutant female mice had elevated estrogen
levels, precocious sexual maturation, increased fecundity, and remained
in estrus for prolonged periods and produced almost 50% more litters
than wildtype mice over the same period of time. Mi et al. (2008)
concluded that sulfate modification of LH by GalNAc4ST1 plays a central
role in regulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonad axis.

306250	TITLE *306250 COLONY-STIMULATING FACTOR 2 RECEPTOR, ALPHA; CSF2RA
;;GRANULOCYTE-MACROPHAGE COLONY-STIMULATING FACTOR RECEPTOR, LOW AFFINITY,
ALPHA SUBUNIT; GMCSFR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF, or CSF2;
138960) activates STAT5 (601511) and other signaling pathways via
binding to a cell surface receptor composed of a ligand-binding alpha
subunit, encoded by CSF2RA, and a nonbinding affinity-enhancing beta
subunit, encoded by CSF2RB (138981) (Suzuki et al., 2008).

CLONING

Using an expression cloning strategy, Gearing et al. (1989) isolated a
cDNA encoding CSF2RA, which they called GMCSFR, from a human placenta
cDNA library. The deduced 400-amino acid precursor protein has a
22-amino acid signal peptide. The 378-amino acid mature protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 43.7 kD and contains a single transmembrane
domain, a glycosylated extracellular domain, and a short
intracytoplasmic tail. Northern blot analysis detected GMCSFR expression
in a variety of hemopoietic cells displaying GMCSF binding.

Raines et al. (1991) identified a truncated, soluble form of the
low-affinity GMCSF receptor in choriocarcinoma cells. Clones encoding
the soluble receptor were identical in sequence to the membrane-bound
form except for a 97-nucleotide deletion. The amino acid sequence of
this deleted cDNA predicted a protein that lacks the 84 C-terminal amino
acids of the membrane-bound receptor, including the transmembrane and
cytoplasmic domains, and contains 16 different amino acids at its C
terminus. RNase protection analysis indicated that this variant cDNA was
derived from a naturally occurring mRNA. Soluble receptors had been
identified for several other hematopoietin receptors and may be a
general feature of this class. It is likely that alternative mRNA
splicing is the mechanism by which the soluble counterparts are
generated.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rappold et al. (1992) found that the CSF2RA gene spans at least 45 kb.

MAPPING

By Southern blot analysis of a panel of mouse-human somatic cell
hybrids, Gough et al. (1990) demonstrated that the CSF2R gene is on the
X chromosome. The possibility that an allele also maps to the Y
chromosome was suggested by the observation that many DNA samples from
normal males carry 2 alleles of this gene. Among 65 normal persons, 23
females and 20 males were homozygous for an allele of fragment A,
whereas 8 females and 14 males were heterozygous. By in situ
hybridization, Gough et al. (1990) showed that the CSF2R gene maps to
the tip of the short arm of the X chromosome and the short arm of the Y
chromosome (see 425000), with the most likely localization being
Xpter-p21 and Ypter-p11.2. Although this information was consistent with
its location in the pseudoautosomal region (PAR), conclusive proof
required study of segregation of the locus with respect to sexual
phenotype. They found in a total of 14 informative male meioses, 3
recombination events; i.e., in 2 cases a daughter had inherited the
allele from the paternal Y chromosome, and in 1 instance a son had
inherited the allele from the paternal X chromosome. Thus, the CSF2R
locus is distal to the MIC2 locus (313470), which shows only about 2.5%
recombination and maps close to the PAR boundary. This was the first
localization of a gene of known function to this region, which
encompasses about 2,500 kb.

By pulsed field gel electrophoresis, Rappold et al. (1992) localized the
CSF2RA gene 1,180 to 1,300 kb from the telomere, in close proximity to
the CpG island B5. The gene showed abundant hypervariable sequences, and
a number of informative restriction fragment length polymorphisms were
defined. Rappold et al. (1992) suggested that these polymorphisms might
be useful in proving the pseudoautosomal inheritance of apparently
autosomal traits, as has been suggested for schizophrenia (Crow, 1988),
cerebral dominance (Crow, 1989), and Kabuki make-up syndrome (Niikawa et
al., 1988; 147920), among others.

Rappold (1993) discussed in detail the pseudoautosomal regions that
exist at the tips of the short and long arms of the X and Y chromosomes
and cover 2.6 and 0.4 Mb, respectively.

By both in situ hybridization and linkage analysis, Disteche et al.
(1992) found that the murine Csf2ra gene maps to chromosome 19.

GENE FUNCTION

DiPersio et al. (1988) studied the binding of GMCSF, over a wide range
of concentrations, to normal human peripheral blood cells, bone marrow,
acute and chronic myeloid leukemia cells, and a number of established
human myeloid and nonmyeloid cell lines; thereby, they defined the
receptors.

Gearing et al. (1989) found that transfection of GMCSFR cDNA into COS
cells directed expression of a GMCSF receptor showing a single class of
affinity and specificity for human GMCSF, but not interleukin-3 (IL3;
147740).

Hayashida et al. (1990) showed that the high-affinity GMCSF receptor is
composed of at least 2 components in a manner analogous to the IL2
receptor (see 147730). They proposed to designate the low-affinity GMCSF
receptor as the alpha subunit, and the 'new' protein that they
identified and called KH97 as the beta subunit (see 138981). The 2
subunits are approximately 80 and 120 kD, respectively.

Raines et al. (1991) found that expression of the variant cDNA encoding
the truncated, soluble CSF2R isoform produced a secreted protein that
retained its capacity to bind CSF2 in solution.

Kondo et al. (2000) showed that a clonogenic common lymphoid progenitor,
a bone marrow-resident cell that gives rise exclusively to lymphocytes
(T, B, and natural killer cells), can be redirected to the myeloid
lineage by stimulation through exogenously expressed interleukin-2
receptor (146710) and GMCSF receptor. Analysis of mutants of the
beta-chain of the IL2 receptor revealed that the granulocyte and
monocyte differentiation signals are triggered by different cytoplasmic
domains, showing that the signaling pathways responsible for these
unique developmental outcomes are separable. Finally, Kondo et al.
(2000) showed that the endogenous myelomonocytic cytokine receptors for
GMCSF and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF1R; 164770) are
expressed at low to moderate levels on the more primitive hematopoietic
stem cells, are absent on common lymphoid progenitors, and are
upregulated after myeloid lineage induction by IL2 (147680). Kondo et
al. (2000) concluded that cytokine signaling can regulate cell fate
decisions and proposed that a critical step in lymphoid commitment is
downregulation of cytokine receptors that drive myeloid cell
development.

Loss of either the X or the Y chromosome is apparent in 25% of acute
myeloid leukemias of the M2 subtype (AML-M2), compared with only 1 to 6%
in other AML subtypes, suggesting the involvement of a 'recessive
oncogene' in the genesis of M2 AMLs. The presumed gene is likely to be
in the PAR, because if it were located in the portion of the X
chromosome not shared with the Y, then similar loss of the Y chromosome
would not be predicted, and vice versa. Gough et al. (1990) suggested
that CSF2R may be the gene in question. Loss or inactivation of both
copies of the gene in a myeloid progenitor cell would be expected to
result in a clone of cells unable to respond to GMCSF, and hence in the
relatively undifferentiated phenotype of the M2 form of leukemia.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare lung disorder in which
surfactant-derived lipoproteins accumulate excessively within pulmonary
alveoli, causing severe respiratory distress. It is a disorder of
surfactant metabolism. The importance of CSF2 in the pathogenesis of PAP
has been confirmed in humans and mice, wherein CSF2 signaling is
required for pulmonary alveolar macrophage catabolism of surfactant.
Using flow cytometry, Martinez-Moczygemba et al. (2008) found that
CSF2RA was absent on monocytes from a 4-year-old girl with PAP due to
pulmonary surfactant metabolism dysfunction (SMDP4; 300770). The
patient's mother expressed CSF2RA on all monocytes, whereas the
patient's father and sister expressed CSF2RA only on a subpopulation of
monocytes. Stimulation of granulocytes with CSF2 induced upregulation of
CD11B (ITGAM; 120980) in the mother, but not the patient. Karyotypic
analysis showed that the patient had 1 X chromosome of apparently normal
length and 1 X chromosome with a truncated Xp arm that did not hybridize
with a PAR1 probe. RT-PCR analysis detected expression of CSF2RA in
leukocytes from the patient's family members, but not in those from the
patient. PCR analysis of the 11 coding exons of the CSF2RA gene revealed
a deletion of exons 5 through 13 (306250.0001) in the patient's DNA,
providing a genetic basis for the absence of CSF2RA mRNA and protein.

Using flow cytometry, Suzuki et al. (2008) found that both CSF2RA and
CSF2RB were present on leukocytes from 2 sisters with PAP, as well as
all family members tested. However, Western blot analysis showed that
the affected sisters expressed only a truncated form of CSF2RA, whereas
their father was heterozygous for the normal and truncated forms, and
their mother expressed only normal CSF2RA. CSF2 binding and
CSF2-dependent signaling were severely reduced, but not abolished, in
the sisters, and their CD11B stimulation test was abnormal. Suzuki et
al. (2008) identified a mutation in the CSF2RA gene in the affected
sisters that resulted in a gly174-to-arg (G174R; 306250.0002)
substitution. The father was heterozygous for the G174R mutation, but
the mother had only wildtype CSF2RA. PCR analysis showed that CSF2RA
copy number was reduced in the sisters and their mother, but not in the
father. FISH analysis demonstrated a 1.6-Mb deletion of PAR1, including
the CSF2RA gene, in 1 X chromosome of the sisters and mother. Suzuki et
al. (2008) concluded that PAP may be caused by compound heterozygous
abnormalities affecting the CSF2RA gene, and that CSF2 signaling is
critical for surfactant homeostasis in humans.

ANIMAL MODEL

Schweizerhof et al. (2009) presented evidence that GCSF (CSF3; 138970)
and GMCSF mediate bone cancer pain and tumor-nerve interactions.
Increased levels of both factors were detected in bone marrow lysates
and adjoining connective tissue in a mouse sarcoma model of bone
tumor-induced pain compared to controls. The functional receptors GCSFR
(CSF3R; 138971) and GMCSFR were expressed on peripheral nerves in the
bone matrix and in dorsal root ganglia. GMCSF sensitized nerves to
mechanical stimuli in vitro and in vivo, potentiated CGRP (114130)
release, and caused sprouting of sensory nerve endings in the skin. RNA
interference of GCSF and GMCSF signaling in the mouse sarcoma model led
to reduced tumor growth and nerve remodeling, and abrogated bone cancer
pain.

In a 4-year-old girl with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (300770),
Martinez-Moczygemba et al. (2008) identified a deletion of exons 5
through 13 in the CSF2RA gene. Karyotypic analysis showed that the
patient's other X chromosome had a truncated Xp arm that did not
hybridize with a probe for pseudoautosomal region-1, which contains
CSF2RA. The patient's mother expressed CSF2RA on all monocytes, whereas
the patient's father and sister expressed CSF2RA only on a subpopulation
of monocytes. Stimulation of granulocytes with CSF2 (1389060) induced
upregulation of CD11B (ITGAM; 120980) in the mother, but not the
patient. RT-PCR analysis detected expression of CSF2RA in leukocytes
from the patient's family members, but not in those from the patient.

Suzuki et al. (2008) identified a G-to-A transition in exon 7 of the
CSF2RA gene in genomic DNA from 2 sisters with pulmonary alveolar
proteinosis (300770), one 6 years of age and the other 8 years of age.
The mutation resulted in a gly174-to-arg (G174R) substitution that
altered 1 of 11 potential N-glycosylation sites in the CSF2RA protein.
Western blot analysis showed that the affected sisters expressed only a
truncated form of CSF2RA, whereas their father was heterozygous for the
normal and truncated forms, and their mother expressed only normal
CSF2RA. CSF2 (138960) binding and CSF2-dependent signaling were severely
reduced, but not abolished, in the sisters, and their CD11B (120980)
stimulation test was abnormal. The father was heterozygous for the G174R
mutation, but the mother had only wildtype CSF2RA. PCR analysis showed
that CSF2RA copy number was reduced in the sisters and their mother, but
not in the father. FISH analysis demonstrated a 1.6-Mb deletion of
pseudoautosomal region-1, including the CSF2RA gene, in 1 X chromosome
of the sisters and mother. Transfection of CSF2RA with the G174R
mutation into 293 cells reproduced the CSF2 signaling defect at
physiologic CSF2 concentrations. At high CSF2 concentrations, similar to
those observed in the index patient, signaling was partially rescued,
thereby providing a molecular explanation for the slow disease
progression in the 2 sisters.

602330	TITLE *602330 ACTIN-BINDING LIM PROTEIN FAMILY, MEMBER 1; ABLIM1
;;ABLIM;;
LIM ACTIN-BINDING PROTEIN 1; LIMAB1;;
LIMATIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ABLIM1 encodes limatin, an actin-binding LIM domain protein (Roof et
al., 1997). LIM domains play key roles in the regulation of
developmental pathways. They were first identified as cysteine-rich
motifs found in 3 proteins: Lin-11, Isl-1 (ISL1; 600366), and Mec-3 (Kim
et al., 1997).

CLONING

By screening a human retina cDNA library with the sequence of dematin
(EPB49; 125305) as probe, Roof et al. (1997) identified a novel cDNA,
designated ABLIM. The deduced ABLIM protein, which the authors called
limatin (LIM + dematin), contains an N-terminal region with 4 double
zinc finger motifs (LIM domains) and a C-terminal cytoskeletal domain
that is approximately 50% identical to that of dematin, an
actin-bundling protein of the erythroid cytoskeleton. The ABLIM protein
exists in 3 alternatively spliced isoforms, all varying in the number of
LIM domains, with widespread tissue distribution. The full-length
778-amino acid protein is found exclusively in the retina and is
enriched in biochemical extracts of retinal rod inner segments.

GENE FUNCTION

Roof et al. (1997) found that all 3 limatin isoforms bind to actin
filaments in vitro through the dematin-like sequence. They also found
that limatin undergoes extensive phosphorylation in light-adapted
retinas in vivo and that its developmental expression in the retina
coincides with the elaboration of photoreceptor inner and outer
segments.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Kim et al. (1997) mapped the
human ABLIM gene to 10q25. Radiation hybrid mapping placed the gene in a
37-cR interval between markers D10S554 and D10S2390. By RFLP analysis,
