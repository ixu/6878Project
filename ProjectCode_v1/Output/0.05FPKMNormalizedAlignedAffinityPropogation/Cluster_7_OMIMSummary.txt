DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ST3GAL3 gene encodes
beta-galactoside-alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase-III, a Golgi resident
membrane protein that forms the sialyl Lewis a (sLe-a) epitope on
glyocoproteins. These glycoproteins form the glycocalyx, composed of
sialic acids that act as key determinants of a variety of cellular
recognition and communication processes (summary by Hu et al., 2011).

CLONING

By screening a human placenta cDNA library with a probe based on the
sialyl motif (a highly conserved region in the catalytic domain of
sialyltransferases), Kitagawa and Paulson (1993) isolated a cDNA
encoding SIAT6, which they termed ST3N (EC 2.4.99.6). The deduced
375-amino acid protein is 97% identical to the rat protein. SDS-PAGE
analysis showed expression of an 80-kD protein having sialyltransferase
activity. Northern blot analysis revealed wide expression of a 2.7-kb
transcript with abundant expression in skeletal muscle and high
expression in fetal tissue but low expression in placenta.

Using Northern blot analysis, Kitagawa and Paulson (1994) evaluated the
differential expression of 5 human sialyltransferase genes in adult and
fetal tissues. A 2.7-kb ST3N transcript was expressed highly in skeletal
muscle and moderately in most other tissues examined. A 3.8-kb
transcript was also expressed in testis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Taniguchi et al. (2003) determined that the 5-prime UTR of the ST3GAL3
gene consists of 2 exons. The 5-prime flanking region of the promoter
lacks canonical TATA or CCAAT boxes, but it contains several putative
transcriptional factor binding sites.

Hu et al. (2011) stated that the ST3GAL3 gene contains 15 exons, 12 of
which are coding exons.

MAPPING

The International RH Mapping Consortium mapped the SIAT6 gene to
chromosome 1 (TMAP stSG22084).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Autosomal Recessive Mental Retardation 12

In affected members of 2 unrelated consanguineous Iranian families with
autosomal recessive nonsyndromic mental retardation-12 (MRT12; 611090),
Hu et al. (2011) used linkage analysis, chromosome sorting, and
next-generation sequencing to identify 2 different homozygous mutations
in the ST3GAL3 gene (A13D, 606494.0001 and D370Y, 606494.0002,
respectively.) Neither mutation affected the highly conserved sialyl
motifs, but rather affected the N-terminal transmembrane domain and
catalytic domain, respectively. In vitro functional expression studies
showed that the mutant proteins were mislocalized to the endoplasmic
reticulum and that one (D370Y) had loss of catalytic activity. The
findings demonstrated a link between the glycoprotein complex,
sialyltransferase activity, and higher cognitive functioning.

- Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy 15

In 4 members of a consanguineous Palestinian family with early infantile
epileptic encephalopathy-15 (EIEE15; 615006), Edvardson et al. (2013)
identified a homozygous mutation in the ST3GAL3 gene (A320P;
606494.0003). The mutation was identified by linkage analysis combined
with whole-exome sequencing of 1 individual and confirmed by Sanger
sequencing. The mutation affected the highly conserved sialyl motif S,
which is crucially involved in binding of both donor and acceptor
substrate. In vitro functional expression studies showed that secretion
of the mutant protein was reduced to 25% of control levels and it had no
detectable enzymatic activity. The phenotype was severe: patients showed
delayed psychomotor development and had onset of refractory infantile
spasms between ages 3 and 7 months associated with hypsarrhythmia on
EEG. Other features included hypotonia, poor eye contact, and inability
to speak or walk, even later in childhood. All were profoundly mentally
retarded. Edvardson et al. (2013) noted that the phenotype was more
severe than that observed by Hu et al. (2011), who had identified
ST3GAL3 mutations outside of the highly conserved and functionally
important sialyl motifs.

MENTAL RETARDATION, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 12
ST3GAL3, ALA13ASP

In affected members of a consanguineous Iranian family with autosomal
recessive mental retardation-12 (MRT12; 611090), previously reported by
Najmabadi et al. (2007), Hu et al. (2011) identified a homozygous 38C-A
transversion in exon 2 of the ST3GAL3 gene, resulting in an ala13-to-asp
(A13D) substitution in the transmembrane domain. The mutation was not
found in 278 copies of chromosome 1 from ethnically matched controls or
in 385 control individuals. In vitro functional expression studies in
murine fibroblasts showed that most of the mutant protein was improperly
localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, preventing the protein from
interacting with its substrates in the Golgi, resulting in a loss of
function. Catalytic activity of the A13D mutant enzyme was similar to
wildtype.

ST3GAL3, ASP370TYR

In affected members of a consanguineous Iranian family with autosomal
recessive mental retardation-12 (MRT12; 611090), Hu et al. (2011)
identified a homozygous 1108G-T transversion in exon 14 of the ST3GAL3
gene, resulting in an asp370-to-tyr (D370Y) substitution in the
catalytic domain at the C-terminal end of the protein. The mutation was
not found in 278 copies of chromosome 1 from ethnically matched controls
or in 385 control individuals. In vitro functional expression studies in
murine fibroblasts showed that the mutant protein was improperly
localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, preventing the protein from
interacting with its substrates in the Golgi, resulting in a loss of
function. The D370Y mutant protein also showed a complete lack of enzyme
activity. Studies of recombinant proteins in CHO cells indicated that
secretion of the D370Y mutant protein was dramatically reduced compared
to wildtype. Hu et al. (2011) concluded that the mutant protein was
cleared by the endoplasmic reticulum-mediated system, suggesting that
the C terminus is important for the proper folding of functional
ST3GAL3.

ST3GAL3, ALA320PRO

In 4 members of a consanguineous Palestinian family with early infantile
epileptic encephalopathy-15 (EIEE15; 615006), Edvardson et al. (2013)
identified a homozygous 958G-C transversion in exon 12 of the ST3GAL3
gene, resulting in an ala320-to-pro (A320P) substitution at a highly
conserved residue in the sialyl motif S. The mutation was identified by
linkage analysis combined with whole-exome sequencing of 1 individual
and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. It segregated with the disorder in
the family and was not found in 123 controls of the same ethnic origin
or in 5,379 control exomes. In vitro functional expression studies
showed that secretion of the mutant protein was reduced to 25% of
control levels and that the protein had no detectable enzymatic
activity.

612927	TITLE *612927 AVL9, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; AVL9
;;KIAA0241
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from an immature myeloid leukemia cell
line cDNA library, Nagase et al. (1996) cloned partial AVL9, which they
designated KIAA0241. Northern blot analysis detected low expression in
brain, lung, testis, liver, heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, pancreas,
spleen, ovary, small intestine, colon, and peripheral blood leukocytes.

By database analysis, Harsay and Schekman (2007) identified AVL9, which
shares 31% and 27% identity across 2 conserved regions with yeast Avl9.
They identified a protein superfamily, which they designated Avl
nine-related (ANR), that includes ANR1 (DUF1630/FAM116A), ANR2
(KIAA1147), and ANR3 (FAM45A).

GENE FUNCTION

Using a synthetic lethal screen designed to identify new secretory
mutants in yeast, Harsay and Schekman (2007) identified S. cerevisiae
Avl9 as a protein whose absence confers a lethal phenotype in a yeast
Vps1/Apl2 double-null mutant. By subcellular fractionation and other
studies, Harsay and Schekman (2007) showed that loss of S. cerevisiae
Avl9p caused a general transport or sorting defect at the Golgi
characterized by disruption of secretory vesicle generation and defects
in actin polarization/polarized growth. Overexpression of Avl9p resulted
in vesicle accumulation and a post-Golgi secretory defect.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1996) mapped the AVL9 gene
to chromosome 7.

;;GOLGI-ASSOCIATED PR1 PROTEIN; GAPR1;;
CHROMOSOME 9 OPEN READING FRAME 19; C9ORF19
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a positional cloning strategy, Eisenberg et al. (2002) identified
a novel transcript in the critical region for IBM2 (600737) on
chromosome 9p13-p12. They cloned the full-length cDNA, designated
C9ORF19, from a human placenta cDNA library. C9ORF19 encodes a deduced
154-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 17.2 kD.
Northern blot analysis detected a 1.9-kb transcript in most adult
tissues tested, with highest expression in lung and peripheral
leukocytes and minor expression in liver and kidney.

GENE STRUCTURE

Eisenberg et al. (2002) determined that the GLIPR2 gene contains 5 exons
and spans more than 27 kb.

GENE FUNCTION

Shoji-Kawata et al. (2013) showed that a peptide, Tat-beclin-1, derived
from a region of the autophagy protein beclin-1 (604378), which binds
HIV-1 Nef, is a potent inducer of autophagy, and interacts with a
negative regulator of autophagy, GAPR1 (also called GLIPR2).
Tat-beclin-1 decreases the accumulation of polyglutamine expansion
protein aggregates and the replication of several pathogens, including
HIV-1, in vitro, and reduces mortality in mice infected with chikungunya
or West Nile virus. Shoji-Kawata et al. (2013) concluded that, through
the characterization of a domain of beclin-1 that interacts with HIV-1
Nef, they have developed an autophagy-inducing peptide that has
potential efficacy in the treatment of human diseases.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Eisenberg et al. (2002) mapped the GLIPR2 gene to
chromosome 9p13-p12.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By mutation analysis in patients with IBM2, Eisenberg et al. (2002)
excluded C9ORF19 as the disease-causing gene.

300560	TITLE *300560 PHD FINGER PROTEIN 8; PHF8
;;ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 422; ZNF422;;
KIAA1111
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Kikuno et al. (1999) cloned PHF8, which they designated
KIAA1111. The deduced 1,084-amino acid protein contains a PHD finger
motif. RT-PCR ELISA detected highest PHF8 expression in ovary.
Expression was intermediate in all other adult and fetal tissues and
specific brain regions examined.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Kikuno et al. (1999) mapped the PHF8 gene
to chromosome X.

GENE FUNCTION

Loenarz et al. (2010) reported that recombinant PHF8 is an Fe(II) and
2-oxoglutarate-dependent N-epsilon-methyl lysine demethylase, which acts
on histone substrates. PHF8 is selective in vitro for N-epsilon-di- and
monomethylated lysine residues and does not accept trimethyl substrates.
Clinically observed mutations to the PHF8 gene cluster in exons encoding
for the double-stranded beta-helix fold and are expected to disrupt
catalytic activity. The PHF8 F279S mutation (300560.0004), which is
associated with mild MR, mild dysmorphic features, and cleft lip and
palate, modifies a conserved hydrophobic region, rendering the enzyme
catalytically inactive. Loenarz et al. (2010) hypothesized that
dependence of PHF8 activity on oxygen availability may explain an
association between maternal hypoxia and facial clefting.

Qi et al. (2010) provided multiple lines of evidence establishing PHF8
as the first monomethyl histone H4 lysine-20 (H4K20me1) demethylase,
with additional activities towards histone H3K9me1 and me2. PHF8 is
located around the transcriptional start sites of approximately 7,000
RefSeq genes and in gene bodies and intergenic regions. PHF8 depletion
resulted in upregulation of H4K20me1 and H3K9me1 at the transcriptional
start site and H3K9me2 in the nontranscriptional start sites,
respectively, demonstrating differential substrate specificities at
different target locations. PHF8 positively regulates gene expression,
which is dependent on its H3K4me3-binding PHD and catalytic domains.
Importantly, patient mutations significantly compromised PHF8 catalytic
function. PHF8 regulates cell survival in the zebrafish brain and jaw
development, thus providing a potentially relevant biologic context for
understanding the clinical symptoms associated with PHF8 patients.
Lastly, genetic and molecular evidence supported a model whereby PHF8
regulates zebrafish neuronal cell survival and jaw development in part
by directly regulating the expression of the homeodomain transcription
factor MSX1/MSXB (605558), which functions downstream of multiple
signaling and developmental pathways. Qi et al. (2010) concluded that
their findings indicated that an imbalance of histone methylation
dynamics has a critical role in X-linked mental retardation.

Liu et al. (2010) reported that PHF8, while using multiple substrates,
including H3K9me1/2 and H3K27me2, also functions as an H4K20me1
demethylase.

PHF8 is recruited to promoters by its PHD domain based on interaction
with H3K4me2/3 and controls G1-S transition in conjunction with E2F1,
HCF1 (300019), and SET1A (611052), at least in part, by removing the
repressive H4K20me1 mark from a subset of E2F1-regulated gene promoters.
Phosphorylation-dependent PHF8 dismissal from chromatin in prophase is
apparently required for the accumulation of H4K20me1 during early
mitosis, which might represent a component of the condensin II loading
process. Accordingly, the HEAT repeat clusters in 2 non-structural
maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) condensin II subunits, NCAPD3 (609276)
and NCAPG2 (608532), are capable of recognizing H4K20me1, and ChIP-Seq
analysis demonstrated a significant overlap of condensin II and H4K20me1
sites in mitotic HeLa cells. Thus, Liu et al. (2010) concluded that the
identification and characterization of an H4K20me1 demethylase, PHF8,
has revealed an intimate link between this enzyme and 2 distinct events
in cell cycle progression.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In the affected males with Siderius X-linked mental retardation syndrome
(300263) reported by Siderius et al. (1999), Laumonnier et al. (2005)
identified a deletion in the PHF8 gene (300560.0001). Subsequent
screening of another family with mental retardation and similar clinical
features revealed a nonsense mutation in PHF8 (300560.0002).

Koivisto et al. (2007) identified a mutation in the PHF8 gene
(300560.0004) in 2 Finnish brothers with X-linked mental retardation and
cleft lip/cleft palate.

631C-T transition in exon 7 of the PHF8 gene, resulting in an
arg211-to-ter (R211X) substitution predicted to truncate the protein.

exon 6 of the PHF8 gene, resulting in a lys177-to-ter mutation. The
predicted protein lacks the Jumonji-like C terminus domain and 5 nuclear
localization signals. The proband's mother did not have the mutation,
indicating that the mutation occurred de novo.

In 2 Finnish brothers with X-linked mental retardation (300263),

PHF8 gene, resulting in a phe279-to-ser (F279S) substitution in the
Jumonji-like C terminus domain of the protein. The clinical phenotype
included mild mental retardation, facial dysmorphism, and cleft
lip/palate. The unaffected mother was a carrier of the mutation. Several
deceased male family members were reportedly affected.

608736	TITLE *608736 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 39 (ZINC TRANSPORTER), MEMBER 14; SLC39A14
;;ZIP14;;
KIAA0062
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Zinc is an essential cofactor for hundreds of enzymes. It is involved in
protein, nucleic acid, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism, as well as in
the control of gene transcription, growth, development, and
differentiation. SLC39A14 belongs to a subfamily of proteins that show
structural characteristics of zinc transporters (Taylor and Nicholson,
2003).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated immature myeloid
cell line cDNA library, Nomura et al. (1994) cloned SLC39A14, which they
designated KIAA0062. The deduced 531-amino acid protein contains
possible transmembrane domains. Northern blot analysis detected SLC39A14
expression in all tissues and cell lines examined. Highest expression
was in liver, and lowest expression was in spleen, thymus, and
peripheral blood leukocytes.

By searching databases for sequences similar to a unique motif within
LIV-1 (SLC39A6; 608731), Taylor and Nicholson (2003) identified
SLC39A14, which they designated LZT-Hs4. SLC39A14 contains a long N
terminus, followed by 8 putative transmembrane domains and a short C
terminus. It also has a motif similar to the catalytic zinc-binding site
of matrix metalloproteases. Expression of SLC39A14 in Chinese hamster
ovary cells showed an apparent molecular mass of 53 kD and suggested
SLC39A14 has up to 3 N-linked carbohydrate side chains. Under
nonreducing conditions, SLC39A14 migrated as a trimer, consistent with
the formation of an ion channel. SLC39A14 was expressed on the plasma
membrane, colocalized with F-actin, and concentrated on lamellipodiae in
a manner similar to membrane-type matrix metalloproteases.

GENE FUNCTION

Liuzzi et al. (2005) found that Zip14 was the most upregulated zinc
transporter in response to turpentine-induced inflammation or
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in mouse liver. Il6 (147620) -/- mice exhibited
neither hypozincemia nor Zip14 induction with turpentine-induced
inflammation, and the hypozincemic response was milder in Il6 -/- mice
exposed to LPS than in wildtype mice. Northern blot analysis revealed
liver-specific upregulation of a single Zip14 transcript.
Immunohistochemical analysis showed increased expression of Zip14 on the
plasma membrane of hepatocytes in response to both LPS and turpentine.
Il6 also produced increased expression of Zip14 in primary hepatocyte
cultures and localization of the Zip14 protein to the plasma membrane.
Transfection of mouse Zip14 cDNA into human embryonic kidney cells
increased zinc uptake. Liuzzi et al. (2005) concluded that ZIP14 is a
zinc importer upregulated by IL6 that plays a major role in the
hypozincemia accompanying the acute-phase response to inflammation and
infection.

Liuzzi et al. (2006) analyzed the capability of mouse Zip14 to mediate
uptake of non-transferrin (190000)-bound iron following expression in
human and insect cells. Zip14 localized to the plasma membrane, and its
overexpression increased uptake of both radiolabeled zinc and iron. Iron
was taken up as Fe(2+), and uptake was inhibited by zinc. Suppression of
endogenous Zip14 in mouse hepatocytes by small interfering RNA (siRNA)
reduced uptake of both iron and zinc. Zip14 siRNA also decreased
metallothionein (see 156350) mRNA levels, suggesting that compensatory
mechanisms were not sufficient to restore intracellular zinc.

MAPPING

By PCR of a human/rodent hybrid panel, Nomura et al. (1994) mapped the
SLC39A14 gene to chromosome 8.

612647	TITLE *612647 RADIAL SPOKE HEAD 4, CHLAMYDOMONAS, HOMOLOG OF, A; RSPH4A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Radial spokes are regularly spaced along cilia, sperm, and flagella
axonemes and have a multisubunit 'stalk' and 'head' that form a signal
transduction scaffold between the central microtubule pair and dynein
(see 603297) arms. RSPH4A is predicted to be a component of the radial
spoke head based on homology with proteins in the biflagellate alga
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and other ciliates (Castleman et al., 2009).

CLONING

By genomewide linkage analysis and positional candidate gene analysis in
5 families with primary ciliary dyskinesia linked to chromosome 6q22
(CILD11; 612649) and central microtubule pair abnormalities, Castleman
et al. (2009) identified the RSPH4A and RSPH9 genes (612648). The
deduced RSPH4A protein contains 716 amino acids and shares about 30%
identity with the Chlamydomonas radial spoke head proteins Rsp4 and
Rsp6.

GENE STRUCTURE

Castleman et al. (2009) determined that the RSPH4A gene contains 6
exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Castleman et al. (2009) mapped the RSPH4A
gene to chromosome 6q22.1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 4 Pakistani families with CILD11, Castleman et
al. (2009) identified a homozygous mutation in the RSPH4A gene
(612647.0001). In affected members of a family of northern European
descent with CILD11, they identified compound heterozygosity for 2
mutations in the RSPH4A gene (612647.0001; 612647.0002). The patients
had classic respiratory features of CILD, but no situs abnormalities.
Electron microscopic studies showed complete absence of the central
microtubule pair of the ciliary axoneme. These findings suggested that
radial spoke proteins are not essential for embryonic nodal ciliary
function, which is important in the determination of left-right axis
development.

Kott et al. (2013) identified pathogenic mutations in the RSPH4A gene
(see, e.g., 612647.0004-612647.0005) in 7 (14%) of 48 families with with
a specific CILD phenotype characterized by ciliary central complex and
radial spoke defects. None of the patients had situs inversus.

In all 10 affected members of 4 Pakistani families with primary ciliary
dyskinesia-11 (612649), Castleman et al. (2009) identified a homozygous
460C-T transition in exon 1 of the RSPH4A gene, resulting in a
gln154-to-ter (Q154X) substitution. The patients had classic respiratory
features of CILD, but no situs abnormalities. Electron microscopic
studies showed complete absence of the central microtubule pair of the
ciliary axoneme.

In affected individuals in a family of northern European descent with
CILD11 (612649), Castleman et al. (2009) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the RSPH4A gene: a 325C-T transition
in exon 1 resulting in a gln109-to-ter (Q109X) substitution, and a
1468C-T transition in exon 3 resulting in an arg490-to-ter (R490X;
612647.0003) substitution. The patients had classic respiratory features
of CILD, but no situs abnormalities. Electron microscopic studies showed
complete absence of the central microtubule pair of the ciliary axoneme.

In a family with primary CILD11 (612649) without situs inversus, Kott et
al. (2013) identified compound heterozygous mutations in the RSPH4A
gene: a 1-bp deletion (667delA), resulting in premature termination
(Ser223AlafsTer15), and a 1-bp deletion (c.1720delA; 612647.0005),
resulting premature termination (Thr424GlnfsTer19). Transmission
electron microscopy showed that a variable proportion of cilia on
respiratory epithelial cells had central complex defects. Radial spokes
were absent in cilia with no central microtubule complex.

612168	TITLE *612168 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 39 (ZINC TRANSPORTER), MEMBER 3; SLC39A3
;;ZRT- AND IRT-LIKE PROTEIN 3; ZIP3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database searching with the sequences of fungal and plant zinc
transporters, Gaither and Eide (2000) identified 3 human members of the
ZIP superfamily: ZIP1 (SLC39A1; 604740), ZIP2 (SLC39A2; 612166), and
ZIP3 (SLC39A3). The 3 deduced human proteins share greater than 49%
similarity.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SLC39A3
gene to chromosome 19 (TMAP RH81024).

GENE FUNCTION

Desouki et al. (2007) noted that normal human prostate glandular
epithelium has the unique function of accumulating high levels of zinc
and that in prostate cancer this capability is lost as an early event in
the development of the malignant cells. By immunohistochemistry analysis
of human normal and malignant prostate tissue sections, they determined
that, like SLC39A1, both SLC39A2 and SLC39A3 are downregulated in
malignant cells in situ along with the depletion of zinc levels. SLC39A2
and SLC39A3 were localized predominantly at the apical cell membrane,
which is in contrast to the SLC39A1 localization at the basolateral
membrane. Desouki et al. (2007) suggested that SLC39A1 is important for
the extraction of zinc from circulation as the primary source of
cellular zinc, whereas SLC39A2 and SLC39A3 are important for retention
of the zinc in the cellular compartment. They proposed that zinc is a
tumor suppressor agent and that SLC39A1, SLC39A2, and SLC39A3 are tumor
suppressor genes.

614471	TITLE *614471 UBIQUITIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE 19; USP19
;;KIAA0891
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

USP19 is a ubiquitin protein ligase (EC 3.4.19.12) with a role in
regulating cell cycle progression (Lu et al., 2009).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned USP19, which they designated
KIAA0891. The deduced 1,371-amino acid protein shares significant
similarity with the ubiquitin protease UNPH (USP4; 603486). RT-PCR ELISA
detected highest expression in fetal liver, followed by adult spinal
cord. All other tissues, including adult and fetal brain, showed much
lower expression, and no expression was detected in spleen.

GENE FUNCTION

p27(KIP1) (CDKN1B; 600778) is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that
regulates the G1/S transition. Using rat myoblast and fibroblast cell
lines, Lu et al. (2009) showed that Usp19 regulated p27(KIP1) levels by
deubiquitinating and stabilizing Kpc1 (RNF123; 614472), an E3 ubiquitin
ligase that ubiquitinates cytosolic p27(KIP1) and targets it for
proteasomal degradation at G1 phase. Immunoprecipitation analysis
revealed that Usp19 interacted directly with Kpc1. Knockdown of Usp19
resulted in loss of Kpc1, accumulation of p27(KIP1), inhibition of cell
proliferation, and slower progression from G0/G1 to S phase.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the USP19 gene
to chromosome 3.

Hartz (2011) mapped the USP19 gene to chromosome 3p21.31 based on an
alignment of the USP19 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB020698) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

607754	TITLE *607754 MAKORIN 1; MKRN1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The Makorin ring finger protein-1 gene (MKRN1) is a highly transcribed,
intron-containing source for a family of intronless mammalian genes
encoding a novel class of zinc finger proteins. Phylogenetic analyses
indicate that the MKRN1 gene is the ancestral founder of this gene
family (Gray et al., 2000).

CLONING

Gray et al. (2000) cloned MKRN1 orthologs from human, mouse, wallaby,
chicken, fruit fly, and nematode, underscoring the age and conservation
of this gene. The human MKRN1 cDNA contains a contiguous sequence of
3,026 basepairs including an open reading frame (ORF) from nucleotide
121 to 1567 that encodes a putative protein of 482 amino acids. Mouse
and Drosophila Mkrn1 proteins share 92% and 27% with the human protein,
respectively, with Drosophila Mkrn1 reaching 63% identity over 123 amino
acids spanning from upstream of the RING finger through the C-terminal
C3H zinc finger. Northern blot analysis of human tissues detected a
single prominent 3.2-kb transcript, suggesting that the MKRN1 gene is
highly and uniformly expressed in all tissues, including different
regions of the brain. High levels were observed in murine embryonic
nervous system and adult testis.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a yeast 2-hybrid system, Kim et al. (2005) found that MKRN1
interacts with a C-terminal domain of TERT (187270), the catalytic
subunit of the telomerase ribonucleoprotein. They demonstrated that
MKRN1 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, promoting TERT ubiquitination
and proteasomal degradation. Mutation of his307 of MKRN1 or deletion of
its C-terminal RING finger domain inactivated the enzyme. Overexpression
of MKRN1 in telomerase-positive human cells decreased telomerase
activity and reduced telomere length. Kim et al. (2005) concluded that
MKRN1 plays a negative role in telomere homeostasis.

GENE FAMILY

The MKRN gene family encodes putative ribonuclear proteins with a
distinctive array of zinc finger motifs, including 2 to 4 C3H zinc
fingers, an unusual cys/his arrangement that may represent a novel zinc
finger structure, and a highly conserved RING zinc finger. Gray et al.
(2000) provided a summary of 9 MKRN family loci distributed throughout
the human genome.

GENE STRUCTURE

The MKRN1 gene consists of 8 exons and spans approximately 28 kb (Gray
et al., 2000).

MAPPING

By FISH and interspecific backcross analysis, respectively, Gray et al.
(2000) determined that the human and mouse MKRN1 loci map to a conserved
syntenic group proximal to the T-cell receptor-beta cluster (TCRB; see
186930) in chromosome 7q34-q35 in human and chromosome 6A in mouse.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hirotsune et al. (2003) reported that transgenic disruption of a
putative pseudogene, Mkrn1-p1, resulted in destabilization of Mkrn1 mRNA
in trans and generated a phenotype with polycystic kidneys and bone
deformity. Gray et al. (2006) were unable to replicate the findings of
Hirotsune et al. (2003). They showed that 5-prime Mkrn1-p1 is fully
methylated on both alleles, indicative of silenced chromatin, and that
Mkrn1-p1 is not transcribed and therefore cannot stabilize Mkrn1
transcripts in trans. They determined that the putative Mkrn1-p1
reported by Hirotsune et al. (2003) is actually a short splice variant
of the Mkrn1 gene. Mice in which Mkrn1 had been directly disrupted
showed none of the phenotypes attributed by Hirotsune et al. (2003) to a
partial reduction of an Mkrn1 isoform. In addition, Gray et al. (2006)
found that Mkrn1-p1 appeared specific to mouse; it was not found in any
other species, including rat.

116806	TITLE *116806 CATENIN, BETA-1; CTNNB1
;;CADHERIN-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN, BETA; CTNNB
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Beta-catenin is an adherens junction protein. Adherens junctions (AJs;
also called the zonula adherens) are critical for the establishment and
maintenance of epithelial layers, such as those lining organ surfaces.
AJs mediate adhesion between cells, communicate a signal that
neighboring cells are present, and anchor the actin cytoskeleton. In
serving these roles, AJs regulate normal cell growth and behavior. At
several stages of embryogenesis, wound healing, and tumor cell
metastasis, cells form and leave epithelia. This process, which involves
the disruption and reestablishment of epithelial cell-cell contacts, may
be regulated by the disassembly and assembly of AJs. AJs may also
function in the transmission of the 'contact inhibition' signal, which
instructs cells to stop dividing once an epithelial sheet is complete
(summary by Peifer, 1993).

CLONING

As reviewed by Peifer (1993), the AJ is a multiprotein complex assembled
around calcium-regulated cell adhesion molecules called cadherins (e.g.,
114020 and 114021). Cadherins are transmembrane proteins: the
extracellular domain mediates homotypic adhesion with cadherins on
neighboring cells, and the intracellular domain interacts with
cytoplasmic proteins that transmit the adhesion signal and anchor the AJ
to the actin cytoskeleton. These cytoplasmic proteins include the alpha-
(116805), beta-, and gamma-catenins. The beta-catenin gene, which was
cloned by McCrea et al. (1991), shows no similarity in sequence to the
genes for the alpha-catenins. The beta-catenin protein shares 70% amino
acid identity with both plakoglobin (173325), which is found in
desmosomes (another type of intracellular junction), and the product of
the Drosophila segment polarity gene 'armadillo.' Armadillo is part of a
multiprotein AJ complex in Drosophila that also includes some homologs
of alpha-catenin and cadherin, and genetic studies indicate that it is
required for cell adhesion and cytoskeletal integrity. The armadillo
gene was originally identified as one of a group of segment polarity
genes that regulate pattern formation of the Drosophila embryonic
cuticle.

GENE STRUCTURE

Nollet et al. (1996) showed that the CTNNB1 gene has 16 exons and spans
23.2 kb. Alternative splicing within exon 16 produced a splice variant
that is 159-bp shorter in the 3-prime untranslated region. The promoter
region was shown to be GC-rich and to contain a TATA box. The authors
demonstrated promoter activity in mouse epithelial cells for the 5-prime
flanking region when it was linked to the reporter gene alkaline
phosphatase.

MAPPING

By FISH, Kraus et al. (1994) mapped the CTNNB1 gene to 3p21, a region
frequently affected by somatic alterations in a variety of tumors. Using
PCR primers for the genomic amplification of beta-catenin sequences on
the basis of homology to exon 4 of the Drosophila armadillo gene, they
analyzed a panel of somatic cell hybrids to confirm the localization of
the gene to human chromosome 3. Exclusion mapping of 3 hybrids carrying
defined fragments of 3p allowed them to determine that the CTNNB1 locus
is close to marker D3S2. Guenet et al. (1995) mapped the homologous
gene, symbolized Catnb by them, to mouse chromosome 9 by analysis of
interspecific backcrosses. Bailey et al. (1995) used FISH and PCR
analysis of somatic cell hybrid DNAs to show that the CTNNB1 gene is
located in the 3p22-p21 region. By FISH, van Hengel et al. (1995)
assigned CTNNB1 to 3p22-p21.3. Trent et al. (1995) likewise localized
the CTNNB1 gene to 3p22 by FISH. They stated that because APC-binding
proteins (like beta-catenin) represent a 'downstream' modulator of APC
activity, the chromosomal locus of such a protein might be expected to
be a site involved in chromosome rearrangements in malignancy.

GENE FUNCTION

Work by Korinek et al. (1997) and by Morin et al. (1997) established
that the APC gene (611731), which is mutant in adenomatous polyposis of
the colon, is a negative regulator of beta-catenin signaling. The APC
protein normally binds to beta-catenin, which interacts with Tcf and Lef
transcription factors. Korinek et al. (1997) cloned a gene, which they
called hTcf-4, that is a Tcf family member expressed in colonic
epithelium. The protein product (Tcf4) transactivates transcription only
when associated with beta-catenin. Nuclei of APC -/- colon carcinoma
cells were found to contain a stable beta-catenin/Tcf4 complex that was
constitutively active, as measured by transcription of a Tcf reporter
gene. Reintroduction of APC removed beta-catenin from Tcf4 and abrogated
the transcriptional activation. Korinek et al. (1997) concluded that
constitutive transcription of Tcf target genes, caused by loss of APC
function, may be a crucial event in the early transformation of colonic
epithelium. Morin et al. (1997) likewise found that the protein products
of mutant APC genes present in colorectal tumors were defective in
downregulating transcriptional activation mediated by beta-catenin and
T-cell transcription factor-4 (TCF4), now known as transcription
factor-7-like-2 (TCF7L2; 602228). Furthermore, colorectal tumors with
intact APC genes were found to contain activating mutations of
beta-catenin that altered functionally significant phosphorylation
sites. These results indicated that regulation of beta-catenin is
critical to the tumor suppressive effect of APC and that this regulation
can be circumvented by mutations in either APC or beta-catenin.

Roose et al. (1999) demonstrated in mice that one of the targets of the
beta-catenin/TCF7L2 interactions in epithelial cells is TCF7 (189908).
Roose et al. (1999) suggested that TCF7 may act as a feedback repressor
of beta-catenin/TCF7L2 target genes, and thus may cooperate with APC to
suppress malignant transformation of epithelial cells.

Rodova et al. (2002) presented evidence for beta-catenin-induced
expression of PKD1 (601313). They analyzed the promoter region of PKD1
and identified numerous transactivating factors, including 4 TCF-binding
elements (TBEs). Beta-catenin induced a reporter construct containing
TBE1 6-fold when cotransfected into HEK293T cells, which express TCF4
(TCF7L2). Dominant-negative TCF4 or deletion of the TBE1 sequence
inhibited the induction. Gel shift assays confirmed that TCF4 and
beta-catenin could complex with the TBE1 site, and HeLa cells stably
transfected with beta-catenin responded with elevated levels of
endogenous PKD1 mRNA. Rodova et al. (2002) concluded that the PKD1 gene
is a target of the beta-catenin/TCF pathway.

Van de Wetering et al. (2002) showed that disruption of
beta-catenin/TCF4 activity in colorectal cancer cells induced a rapid G1
arrest and blocked a genetic program that was physiologically active in
the proliferative compartment of colon crypts. Coincidently, an
intestinal differentiation program was induced. The TCF4 target gene MYC
(190080) played a central role in this switch by direct repression of
the CDKN1A (116899) promoter. Following disruption of beta-catenin/TCF4
activity, the decreased expression of MYC released CDKN1A transcription,
which in turn mediated G1 arrest and differentiation. The authors
concluded that the beta-catenin/TCF4 complex constitutes the master
switch that controls proliferation versus differentiation in healthy and
malignant intestinal epithelial cells.

Glucuronic acid epimerase (GLCE; 612134) is responsible for
epimerization of D-glucuronic acid (GlcA) to L-iduronic acid (IdoA) of
the cell surface polysaccharide heparan sulfate (HS), endowing the
nascent HS polysaccharide chain with the ability to bind growth factors
and cytokines. Using stepwise deletion and site-directed mutagenesis,
Ghiselli and Agrawal (2005) identified 2 cis-acting binding elements for
the beta-catenin-TCF4 complex in the enhancer region of the GLCE
promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift analyses
confirmed binding of beta-catenin-TCF4 to these sequences of GLCE. GLCE
expression in human colon carcinoma cell lines correlated with the
degree of activation of the beta-catenin-TCF4 transactivation complex.
Furthermore, ectopic expression of beta-catenin-TCF4 increased the GLCE
transcript level and enhanced the rate of GlcA epimerization in HS.
Ghiselli and Agrawal (2005) concluded that the beta-catenin-TCF4
transactivation pathway plays a major role in modulating GLCE
expression, thus contributing to regulation of HS biosynthesis and its
structural organization.

Batlle et al. (2002) showed that beta-catenin and TCF inversely control
the expression of the EphB2 (600997)/EphB3 (601839) receptors and their
ligand, ephrin B1 (EFNB1; 300035), in colorectal cancer and along the
crypt-villus axis. Disruption of EphB2 and EphB3 genes revealed that
their gene products restrict cell intermingling and allocate cell
populations within the intestinal epithelium. In EphB2/EphB3 null mice,
the proliferative and differentiated populations intermingled. In adult
EphB3 -/- mice, Paneth cells did not follow their downward migratory
path, but scattered along crypt and villus. The authors concluded that,
in the intestinal epithelium, beta-catenin and TCF couple proliferation
and differentiation to the sorting of cell populations through the
EphB/ephrin B system.

Kawasaki et al. (2000) cloned a gene, ASEF (605216), whose protein
product interacts directly with APC (611731). ASEF immunoprecipitates
with beta-catenin; however, ASEF and beta-catenin do not interact
directly, suggesting that ASEF, APC, and beta-catenin are found in the
same complex in vivo. Kawasaki et al. (2000) suggested that the APC-ASEF
complex may regulate the actin cytoskeletal network, cell morphology and
migration, and neuronal function.

In addition to the inhibition of ubiquitination (see BTRC, 603482) of
phosphorylated IKBA (164008), Neish et al. (2000) observed that
phosphorylated CTNNB1 is not ubiquitinated in epithelial cells exposed
to avirulent Salmonella.

Eastman and Grosschedl (1999) reviewed progress in understanding of how
the activities of both beta-catenin and LEF1/TCF (153245) proteins are
regulated. They summarized the interactions of beta-catenin and LEF1/TCF
proteins, including a discussion of how cellular events can influence
the stability of beta-catenin and its availability for association with
LEF1/TCF proteins. Eastman and Grosschedl (1999) also discussed factors
that influence beta-catenin activity independent of a Wnt signal.

Kang et al. (2002) showed that presenilin-1 (PS1; 104311) functions as a
scaffold that rapidly couples beta-catenin phosphorylation through 2
sequential kinase activities independent of the Wnt-regulated axin
(603816)/CK1-alpha (600505) complex. Presenilin deficiency resulted in
increased beta-catenin stability in vitro and in vivo by disconnecting
the stepwise phosphorylation of beta-catenin, both in the presence and
absence of Wnt stimulation. These findings highlighted an aspect of
beta-catenin regulation outside of the canonical Wnt-regulated pathway
and a function of presenilin separate from intramembrane proteolysis.

Murase et al. (2002) transfected fluorescence-tagged chick beta-catenin
into rat hippocampal neurons in culture. They found that, upon
depolarization, beta-catenin moved from dendritic shafts into spines and
increased its association with cadherins. This redistribution of
beta-catenin was mimicked by addition of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor and
prevented by addition of a phosphatase inhibitor. Transfection with a
chick beta-catenin carrying a phosphorylation-preventing mutation of
tyr654 (tyr654 to phe; Y654F) resulted in concentration of beta-catenin
within spines, whereas transfection with a phosphorylation-mimicking
mutation (tyr654 to glu; Y654E) resulted in beta-catenin accumulation in
dendritic shafts. The Y654F-expressing neurons also exhibited a higher
minifrequency and larger Psd95 (602887) and synapsin-1 (313440) clusters
within synaptic spines.

Tetsu and McCormick (1999) showed that beta-catenin activated
transcription from the cyclin D1 (CCND1; 168461) promoter. They
identified promoter sequences related to consensus TCF/LEF-binding sites
that were necessary for activation. p21 RAS (see 190020) further
activated transcription of the cyclin D1 gene through sites within the
promoter that bind the transcriptional regulators ETS (see 164720) or
CREB (CREB1; 123810). Cells expressing mutant beta-catenin produced high
levels of cyclin D1 mRNA and protein. Furthermore, expression of a
dominant-negative form of TCF in colon cancer cells inhibited expression
of cyclin D1 without affecting expression of other cyclins or
cyclin-dependent kinases and caused cells to arrest in G1.

Lin et al. (2000) demonstrated that CCND1 is one of the targets of
beta-catenin in breast cancer (114480) cells. They found that high
beta-catenin activity correlated with poor patient prognosis and was a
strong and independent prognostic factor in breast cancer. These studies
indicated that beta-catenin can be involved in breast cancer formation
and/or progression and may serve as a target for breast cancer therapy.

Van Aken et al. (2002) studied the cadherin-catenin complex in
retinoblastoma and normal retina tissues. In both cases, they found that
N-cadherin (114020) was associated with alpha- and beta-catenin but not
with E- or P-cadherin. Moreover, retinoblastoma cells, in contrast with
normal retina, expressed an N-cadherin/catenin complex that was
irregularly distributed and weakly linked to the cytoskeleton. In
retinoblastoma, this complex acted as an invasion promoter.

Widlund et al. (2002) identified beta-catenin as a significant regulator
of melanoma cell growth, with MITF (156845) as a critical downstream
target. Disruption of the canonical Wnt pathway abrogated growth of
melanoma cells, and constitutive overexpression of MITF rescued the
growth suppression.

The morphogenesis of organs as diverse as lungs, teeth, and hair
follicles is initiated by a downgrowth from a layer of epithelial stem
cells. During follicular morphogenesis, stem cells form this bud
structure by changing their polarity and cell-to-cell contact. Jamora et
al. (2003) showed that this process is achieved through simultaneous
receipt of 2 external signals: a WNT protein (WNT3A; 606359) to
stabilize beta-catenin, and a bone morphogenetic protein inhibitor
(Noggin; 602991) to produce Lef1. Beta-catenin then binds to and
activates Lef1 transcription complexes that appear to act
uncharacteristically by downregulating the gene encoding E-cadherin
(192090), an important component of polarity and intercellular adhesion.
When either signal is missing, functional Lef1 complexes are not made,
and E-cadherin downregulation and follicle morphogenesis are impaired.
In Drosophila, E-cadherin can influence the plane of cell division and
cytoskeletal dynamics. Consistent with this notion, Jamora et al. (2003)
showed that forced elevation of E-cadherin levels block invagination and
follicle production. Jamora et al. (2003) concluded that their findings
reveal an intricate molecular program that links 2 extracellular
signaling pathways to the formation of a nuclear transcription factor
that acts on target genes to remodel cellular junctions and permit
follicle formation.

Jarvinen et al. (2006) found that expression of a stabilized form of
beta-catenin in embryonic mouse oral and dental epithelium led to tooth
buds that gave rise to dozens of teeth. The molar crowns, however, were
typically simplified unicusped cones. Supernumerary teeth developed by a
renewal process where new signaling centers, the enamel knots, budded
off from the existing dental epithelium.

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have the ability to renew themselves and
to give rise to all lineages of the blood. Reya et al. (2003) showed
that the WNT signaling pathway has an important role in this process.
Overexpression of activated beta-catenin expands the pool of HSCs in
long-term cultures by both phenotype and function. Furthermore, HSCs in
their normal microenvironment activate a LEF1/TCF reporter, which
indicates that HSCs respond to WNT signaling in vivo. To demonstrate the
physiologic significance of this pathway for HSC proliferation, Reya et
al. (2003) showed that the ectopic expression of axin or a frizzled
(603408) ligand-binding domain, inhibitors of the WNT signaling pathway,
led to inhibition of HSC growth in vitro and reduced reconstitution in
vivo. Furthermore, activation of WNT signaling in HSCs induced increased
expression of HOXB4 (142965) and NOTCH1 (190198), genes previously
implicated in self-renewal of HSCs. Reya et al. (2003) concluded that
the WNT signaling pathway is critical for normal HSC homeostasis in
vitro and in vivo, and provide insight into a potential molecular
hierarchy of regulation of HSC development.

In rat hippocampal neuronal cultures, Yu and Malenka (2003) found that
increasing the intracellular levels of beta-catenin enhanced dendritic
arborization. Although the effect did not require
WNT-beta-catenin-dependent transcription, WNT was involved in enhanced
dendritic arborization resulting from depolarization. Proteins that
sequestered beta-catenin decreased dendritic branch tip number and total
dendritic branch length. Yu and Malenka (2003) concluded that
beta-catenin is a mediator of dendritic development.

To test whether nuclear translocation of beta-catenin is involved in
axial identity and/or germ layer formation in 'pre-bilaterians,'
Wikramanayake et al. (2003) examined the in vivo distribution,
stability, and function of beta-catenin protein in embryos of the sea
anemone Nematostella vectensis. Wikramanayake et al. (2003) found that
N. vectensis beta-catenin is differentially stabilized along the
oral-aboral axis, translocated into nuclei in cells at the site of
gastrulation, and used to specify ectoderm, indicating an evolutionarily
ancient role for this protein in early pattern formation.

Lee et al. (2004) demonstrated that WNT/beta-catenin signal activation
in emigrating mouse neural crest stem cells had little effect on the
population size and instead regulated fate decisions. Sustained
beta-catenin activity in neural crest cells promoted the formation of
sensory neural cells in vivo at the expense of virtually all other
neural crest derivatives. Moreover, Lee et al. (2004) demonstrated that
WNT is able to instruct early neural crest stem cells to adopt a sensory
neuronal fate in a beta-catenin-dependent manner. Thus, Lee et al.
(2004) concluded that the role of WNT/beta-catenin in stem cells is
cell-type dependent.

Kleber et al. (2005) found that Bmp2 (112261) signaling antagonized the
sensory fate-inducing activity of Wnt/beta-catenin. Wnt and Bmp2 acted
synergistically to suppress differentiation and to maintain mouse neural
crest stem cell marker expression and multipotency.

Brembeck et al. (2004) found that BCL9-2 (BCL9L; 609004) was involved in
the switch between the adhesive and transcriptional functions of
beta-catenin. The switch was initiated by tyrosine phosphorylation of
beta-catenin, which favored BCL9-2 binding and precluded interaction
with alpha-catenin.

By coimmunoprecipitation and tandem mass spectrometric analysis, Tian et
al. (2004) found that 14-3-3-zeta is a beta-catenin-interacting protein.
14-3-3-zeta enhanced beta-catenin-dependent transcription by stabilizing
beta-catenin in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, 14-3-3-zeta facilitated
activation of beta-catenin by AKT (see AKT1; 164730) and colocalized
with activated Akt in mouse intestinal stem cells. Tian et al. (2004)
proposed that AKT phosphorylates beta-catenin, leading to 14-3-3-zeta
binding and stabilization of beta catenin.

Guo et al. (2004) found that several Wnt genes, including Wnt4 (603490),
Wnt14 (602863), and Wnt16 (606267), were expressed in overlapping and
complementary patterns in developing mouse synovial joints, where Ctnnb1
protein level and transcription activity were upregulated. Removal of
Ctnnb1 early in mesenchymal progenitor cells promoted chondrocyte
differentiation and blocked the activity of Wnt14 in joint formation.
Ectopic expression of an activated form of Ctnnb1 or Wnt14 in early
differentiating chondrocytes induced ectopic joint formation both
morphologically and molecularly. In contrast, genetic removal of Ctnnb1
in chondrocytes led to joint fusion. Guo et al. (2004) concluded that
the Wnt/CTNNB1 signaling pathway is necessary and sufficient to induce
early steps of synovial joint formation, and they suggested that WNT4,
WNT14, and WNT16 may play redundant roles in synovial joint induction by
signaling through the CTNNB1-mediated canonical Wnt pathway.

Kaplan et al. (2004) found that, in addition to its roles in cell-cell
adhesion and Wnt-stimulated transcriptional activation, beta-catenin has
a role in establishing bipolar mitotic spindles. During mitosis in mouse
fibroblasts and HeLa cells, beta-catenin relocalized to mitotic spindle
poles and to the midbody. Biochemical fractionation demonstrated the
presence of beta-catenin in purified centrosome preparations. Reduction
of beta-catenin by RNA interference led to failure of centrosomes to
fully separate, resulting in a marked increase in the frequency of
monoastral mitotic spindles.

Kim et al. (2005) reported that the downregulation of a metastasis
suppressor gene, KAI1 (600623), in prostate cancer cells involves the
inhibitory actions of beta-catenin, along with a reptin (TIP48; 604788)
chromatin remodeling complex. This inhibitory function of
beta-catenin-reptin requires both increased beta-catenin expression and
recruitment of histone deacetylase activity. The coordinated actions of
beta-catenin-reptin components that mediate the repressive state serve
to antagonize a TIP60 (601409) coactivator complex that is required for
activation; the balance of these opposing complexes controls the
expression of KAI1 and metastatic potential. Kim et al. (2005) concluded
that the molecular mechanisms underlying the antagonistic regulation of
beta-catenin-reptin and the TIP60 coactivator complexes for the
metastasis suppressor gene, KAI1, are likely to be prototypic of a
selective downregulation strategy for many genes, including a subset of
NF-kappa-B (see 164011) target genes.

Essers et al. (2005) reported an evolutionarily conserved interaction of
beta-catenin with FOXO transcription factors (e.g., 602681), which are
regulated by insulin and oxidative stress signaling. In mammalian cells,
beta-catenin binds directly to FOXO and enhances FOXO transcriptional
activity. In C. elegans, loss of the beta-catenin BAR1 reduces the
activity of the FOXO ortholog DAF16 in dauer formation and life span.
Association of beta-catenin with FOXO was enhanced in cells exposed to
oxidative stress. Furthermore, BAR1 was required for the oxidative
stress-induced expression of the DAF16 target gene sod3 and for
resistance to oxidative damage. Essers et al. (2005) concluded that
their results demonstrated a role for beta-catenin in regulating FOXO
function that is particularly important under conditions of oxidative
stress.

Shah et al. (2006) stated that the signaling and oncogenic activity of
beta-catenin can be repressed by activation of vitamin D receptor (VDR;
601769). Conversely, high levels of beta-catenin can potentiate the
transcriptional activity of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Shah et al. (2006)
showed that the effects of beta-catenin on VDR activity are due
interaction between the activator function-2 domain of VDR and the C
terminus of beta-catenin.

Noubissi et al. (2006) demonstrated that beta-catenin stabilizes the
mRNA encoding the F-box protein beta-TrCP1 (BTRCP1; 603482), and
identified the RNA-binding protein CRDBP (608288) as a target of beta
catenin/Tcf transcription factor. CRDBP binds to the coding region of
BTRCP1 mRNA. Overexpression of CRDBP stabilized BTRCP1 mRNA and elevated
BTRCP1 levels both in cells and in vivo, resulting in the activation of
the Skp1-Cullin1-F-box protein (SCF)-BTRCP1 E3 ubiquitin ligase and in
accelerated turnover of its substrates including I-kappa-B (see 164008)
and beta-catenin. CRDBP is essential for the induction of both BTRCP1
and c-Myc (190080) by beta-catenin signaling in colorectal cancer cells.
Noubissi et al. (2006) concluded that high levels of CRDBP that are
found in primary human colorectal tumors exhibiting active
beta-catenin/Tcf signaling implicates CRDBP induction in the
upregulation of BTRCP1, in the activation of dimeric transcription
factor NF-kappa-B, and in the suppression of apoptosis in these cancers.

Parakh et al. (2006) found that expression of beta-catenin lacking the
N-terminal 90-amino acids that lead to its degradation significantly
enhanced follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH; see 136350)-mediated
induction of CYP19A1 (107910) and CYP11A1 (118485) mRNA. CYP19A1
transactivation by SF1 (NR5A1; 601516) required a functional interaction
with beta-catenin and an intact beta-catenin-binding site. The
beta-catenin-binding site was also critical for the synergistic actions
of FSH and SF1 on CYP19A1. The actions of beta-catenin on CYP19A1 were
dependent on hormone-induced cAMP cascades. Parakh et al. (2006)
concluded that beta-catenin is essential for FSH/cAMP-regulated gene
expression in ovary and that beta-catenin has a role in estrogen
biosynthesis.

Moore et al. (2008) showed that epitope-tagged mammalian Mtgr1 (CBFA2T2;
603672), Mtg8 (RUNX1T1; 133435), and Mtg16 (CBFA2T3; 603870) interacted
with human TCF4 in cotransfected COS-7 cells. Beta-catenin disrupted
interaction of Mtg proteins with TCF4. When expressed in Xenopus
embryos, Mtg family members inhibited Wnt-dependent axis formation and
impaired the ability of beta-catenin or Lef1 to induce axis duplication.
Furthermore, Myc was overexpressed in the small intestine of mice
lacking Mtgr1. Moore et al. (2008) concluded that MTG proteins act
downstream of beta-catenin in the Wnt signaling pathway.

Fungiform taste papillae form a regular array on the dorsal surface of
the tongue. Taste buds arise from papilla epithelium and, unusual for
epithelial derivatives, synapse with neurons, release neurotransmitters,
and generate receptor and action potentials. Liu et al. (2007)
demonstrated that Wnt-beta-catenin signaling is activated in developing
fungiform placodes and taste bud cells. They showed that a dominant
stabilizing mutation in epithelial beta-catenin causes massive
overproduction of enlarged fungiform papillae and taste buds. Likewise,
genetic deletion of epithelial beta-catenin or inhibition of
Wnt-beta-catenin signaling by ectopic dickkopf-1 (Dkk1; 605189) blocked
initiation of fungiform papilla morphogenesis. Ectopic papillae were
innervated in the stabilizing beta-catenin mutant, whereas ectopic Dkk1
caused absence of lingual epithelial innervation. Thus, Wnt-beta-catenin
signaling is critical for fungiform papilla and taste bud development.
Altered regulation of the pathway may underlie evolutionary changes in
taste papilla patterning.

Bahmanyar et al. (2008) found that stabilization of beta-catenin,
mimicking mutations found in cancer, induced centrosome splitting,
similar to ectopic NEK2 (604043) activation. They identified
beta-catenin as a substrate and binding partner for NEK2 in vitro and in
vivo and found that beta-catenin colocalized with the NEK2 substrates
rootletin (CROCC) and CNAP1 (CEP2; 609689) between centrosomes. CNAP1
and rootletin were required for localization of beta-catenin between
centrosomes in interphase, whereas beta-catenin had
rootletin-independent binding sites on chromosomes at mitotic spindle
poles. In response to ectopic expression of active NEK2 in interphase
cells, rootletin was reduced at interphase centrosomes and beta-catenin
localized to rootletin-independent sites on centrosomes, an event
required for centrosome separation in mitosis.

Continuous turnover of epithelia is ensured by the extensive
self-renewal capacity of tissue-specific stem cells. Similarly,
epithelial tumor maintenance relies on cancer stem cells, which co-opt
stem cell properties. In murine skin, follicular morphogenesis is driven
by bulge stem cells that specifically express CD34 (142230). Malanchi et
al. (2008) identified a population of cells in early epidermal tumors
characterized by phenotype and functional similarities to normal bulge
skin stem cells. This population contains cancer stem cells, which are
the only cells with tumor initiation properties. Transplants derived
from these cancer stem cells preserve the hierarchical organization of
the primary tumor. Malanchi et al. (2008) described beta-catenin
signaling as being essential in sustaining the cancer stem cell
phenotype. Ablation of the beta-catenin gene results in the loss of
cancer stem cells and complete tumor regression. In addition, Malanchi
et al. (2008) provided evidence for the involvement of increased
beta-catenin signaling in malignant human squamous cell carcinomas.
Malanchi et al. (2008) concluded that because Wnt/beta-catenin signaling
is not essential for normal epidermal homeostasis, such a mechanistic
difference may thus be targeted to eliminate cancer stem cells and
consequently eradicate squamous cell carcinomas.

To identify genes that both modulate beta-catenin activity and are
essential for colon cancer cell proliferation, Firestein et al. (2008)
conducted 2 loss-of-function screens in human colon cancer cells and
compared genes identified in these screens with an analysis of copy
number alterations in colon cancer specimens. One of these genes,
cyclin-dependent kinase-8 (CDK8; 603184), which encodes a member of the
mediator complex, is located at 13q12.13, a region of recurrent copy
number gain in a substantial fraction of colon cancers. Firestein et al.
(2008) showed that suppression of CDK8 expression inhibits proliferation
in colon cancer cells characterized by high levels of CDK8 and
beta-catenin hyperactivity. CDK8 kinase activity was necessary for
beta-catenin-driven transformation and for expression of several
beta-catenin transcriptional targets.

Morris et al. (2008) demonstrated that the transcription factor E2F1
(189971) is a potent and specific inhibitor of beta-catenin/T cell
factor (TCF)-dependent transcription and that this function contributes
to E2F1-induced apoptosis. E2F1 deregulation suppresses beta-catenin
activity in an APC (611731)/glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3; see
606784)-independent manner, reducing the expression of key beta-catenin
targets including c-MYC (190080). This interaction explains why
colorectal tumors, which depend on beta-catenin transcription for their
abnormal proliferation, keep RB1 (614041) intact. Remarkably, E2F1
activity is also repressed by CDK8, a colorectal oncoprotein. Elevated
levels of CDK8 protect beta-catenin/TCF-dependent transcription from
inhibition by E2F1. Morris et al. (2008) concluded that thus, by
retaining RB1 and amplifying CDK8, colorectal tumor cells select
conditions that collectively suppress E2F1 and enhance the activity of
beta-catenin.

Independently, Chassot et al. (2008) and Tomizuka et al. (2008) found
that knockout of Rspo1 (609595) in mice resulted in at least partial sex
reversal in females, but not males. Rspo1 was required for activation of
beta-catenin and Wnt4 signaling for female sex determination.

In familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), beta-catenin is stabilized
constitutively, providing a permanent mitogenic signal to normally
resting cells. This occurs when the second allele of APC (611731) is
inactivated somatically. Kohler et al. (2009) described an APC domain,
the beta-catenin inhibitory domain (CID), that is located between the
second and third 20-amino acid beta-catenin-binding repeats and
therefore was present in many truncated APC products found in human
tumors. In truncated APC, the CID was absolutely necessary to
downregulate the transcriptional activity and the level of beta-catenin,
even when an axin/conductin binding site was present. The activity of
the CID was dramatically reduced in several colon cancer cell lines and
could be inhibited by shorter truncated APC lacking the CID. The authors
concluded that CID is a direct target of the selective pressure acting
on APC during tumorigenesis, and it explains the interdependence of both
APC mutations in colorectal, duodenal, and desmoid tumors.

Huang et al. (2009) used a chemical genetic screen to identify a small
molecule, XAV939, which selectively inhibits beta-catenin-mediated
transcription. XAV939 stimulates beta-catenin degradation by stabilizing
axin (603816), the concentration-limiting component of the destruction
complex. Using a quantitative chemical proteomic approach, Huang et al.
(2009) found that XAV939 stabilizes axin by inhibiting the
poly-ADP-ribosylating enzymes tankyrase-1 (603303) and tankyrase-2
(607128). Both tankyrase isoforms interact with a highly conserved
domain of axin and stimulate its degradation through the
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.

Gattinoni et al. (2009) reported that induction of Wnt/beta-catenin
signaling by inhibitors of Gsk3b or by Wnt3a arrested mouse Cd8 (see
186910)-positive T-cell development into effector T cells capable of
cytotoxicity or Ifng (147570) production. Instead, Wnt signaling
promoted expression of Tcf7 and Lef1 and generation of self-renewing
multipotent Cd8-positive memory stem cells capable of proliferation and
antitumor activity. Gattinoni et al. (2009) concluded that Wnt signaling
has a key role in maintaining the self-renewing stem cell-like
properties of mature memory CD8-positive T cells.

Using RT-PCR and flow cytometric analysis, Zhao et al. (2010)
demonstrated that mouse Tcf7 and Lef1 were highly expressed in naive T
cells, downregulated in effector T cells, and upregulated in memory T
cells. Memory Cd8-positive T cells expressing the p45 Tcf7 isoform and
beta-catenin had enhanced Il2 (147680) production capacity and enhanced
effector capacity to clear Listeria monocytogenes. Zhao et al. (2010)
concluded that constitutive activation of the Wnt pathway favors memory
CD8 T-cell formation during immunization, resulting in enhanced immunity
upon a second encounter with the same pathogen.

Using a genetic approach, Driessens et al. (2010) found no evidence that
the beta-catenin pathway regulates T-cell memory phenotype, in contrast
with the findings of Gattinoni et al. (2009). The findings of Driessens
et al. (2010) suggested that the generation of Cd8-positive memory stem
cells observed by Gattinoni et al. (2009) with the use of Gsk3b
inhibitors was not a consequence of activation of the beta-catenin
pathway, but was rather due activation of another Gsk3b-dependent
pathway. In a reply, Gattinoni et al. (2010) noted that others,
including Zhao et al. (2010) and Jeannet et al. (2010), had also
identified Wnt and beta-catenin as crucial factors in postthymic
Cd8-positive T-cell differentiation and memory development. Using
Western blot analysis, Gattinoni et al. (2010) showed that addition of
Wnt3a or Gsk3b inhibitor stabilized beta-catenin in primed Cd8-positive
mouse T cells.

Manicassamy et al. (2010) reported that the Wnt-beta-catenin signaling
in intestinal dendritic cells regulates the balance between inflammatory
versus regulatory responses in the gut. Beta-catenin in intestinal
dendritic cells was required for the expression of antiinflammatory
mediators such as retinoic acid metabolizing enzymes, interleukin-10
(124092), and transforming growth factor-beta (190180), and the
stimulation of regulatory T cell induction while suppressing
inflammatory effector T cells. Furthermore, ablation of beta-catenin
expression in dendritic cells enhanced inflammatory responses and
disease in a mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease. This,
Manicassamy et al. (2010) concluded that beta-catenin signaling programs
dendritic cells to a tolerogenic state, limiting the inflammatory
response. Murphy (2011) commented that the deletion of beta-catenin in
macrophages remains a caveat to the interpretation of Manicassamy et al.
(2010) that Wnt signaling programs dendritic cells into a tolerogenic
state. Development of strains expressing Cre in a more finely
lineage-restricted pattern is necessary to resolve this issue.
Manicassamy and Pulendran (2011) responded that beta-catenin-deficient
dendritic cells are greatly impaired in inducing regulatory T cells, and
induce enhanced TH17/TH1 responses. They agreed that assessing the
relative importance of dendritic cells versus macrophages in intestinal
tolerance awaits tools that permit the genetic deletion of the numerous
dendritic cell and macrophage subsets in the intestine.

Yang et al. (2011) demonstrated in human cancer cells that EGFR (131550)
activation induces translocation of PKM2, but not PKM1 (see 179050),
into the nucleus, where K433 of PKM2 binds to c-Src-phosphorylated Y333
of beta-catenin. This interaction is required for both proteins to be
recruited to the CCND1 (168461) promoter, leading to HDAC3 (605166)
removal from the promoter, histone H3 acetylation, and cyclin D1
expression. PKM2-dependent beta-catenin transactivation is instrumental
in EGFR-promoted tumor cell proliferation and brain tumor development.
In addition, positive correlations were identified between c-Src
activity, beta-catenin Y333 phosphorylation, and PKM2 nuclear
accumulation in human glioblastoma specimens. Furthermore, levels of
beta-catenin phosphorylation and nuclear PKM2 were correlated with
grades of glioma malignancy and prognosis. Yang et al. (2011) concluded
that their findings revealed that EGF induces beta-catenin
transactivation via a mechanism distinct from that induced by
Wnt/Wingless and highlighted the essential nonmetabolic functions of
PKM2 in EGFR-promoted beta-catenin transactivation, cell proliferation,
and tumorigenesis.

Hoffmeyer et al. (2012) reported a molecular link between
Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and the expression of the telomerase subunit
Tert (187270). Beta-catenin-deficient mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells
have short telomeres; conversely, ES cells expressing an activated form
of beta-catenin (beta-catenin(deltaEx3/+)) have long telomeres.
Hoffmeyer et al. (2012) showed that beta-catenin regulates Tert
expression through the interaction with Klf4 (602253), a core component
of the pluripotency transcriptional network. Beta-catenin binds to the
Tert promoter in a mouse intestinal tumor model and in human carcinoma
cells. Hoffmeyer et al. (2012) uncovered a theretofore unknown link
between the stem cell and oncogenic potential whereby beta-catenin
regulates Tert expression, and thereby telomere length, which could be
critical in human regenerative therapy and cancer.

In mice, Takeo et al. (2013) showed that nail stem cells (NSCs) reside
in the proximal nail matrix and are defined by high expression of
keratin-14 (148066), keratin-17 (148069), and KI67 (MKI67; 176741). The
mechanisms governing NSC differentiation are coupled directly to their
ability to orchestrate digit regeneration. Early nail progenitors
undergo Wnt (see 164820)-dependent differentiation into the nail. After
amputation, this Wnt activation is required for nail regeneration and
also for attracting nerves that promote mesenchymal blastema growth,
leading to the regeneration of the digit. Amputations proximal to the
Wnt-active nail progenitors result in failure to regenerate the nail or
digit. Nevertheless, beta-catenin stabilization in the NSC region
induced their regeneration. Takeo et al. (2013) concluded that their
results established a link between nail stem cell differentiation and
digit regeneration, and suggested that NSCs may have the potential to
contribute to the development of novel treatments for amputees.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

In adherens junctions, alpha-catenin links the cadherin/beta-catenin
complex to the actin-based cytoskeleton. Alpha-catenin is a homodimer in
solution, but forms a 1:1 heterodimer with beta-catenin. Pokutta and
Weis (2000) determined the crystal structure of the alpha-catenin
dimerization domain, residues 82 to 279. The crystal structure showed
that alpha-catenin dimerizes through formation of a 4-helix bundle in
which 2 antiparallel helices are contributed by each protomer. A
slightly larger fragment, containing residues 57 to 264, binds to
beta-catenin. The crystal structure of a chimera consisting of the
alpha-catenin-binding region of beta-catenin linked to the N terminus of
alpha-catenin residues 57 to 264 revealed the interaction between alpha-
and beta-catenin and provided a basis for understanding adherens
junction assembly.

Graham et al. (2002) determined the crystal structure at 2.5-angstrom
resolution of a complex between CTNNB1 and ICAT (607758), a protein that
prevents interaction between CTNNB1 and TCF/LEF family transcription
factors. ICAT contains a 3-helix bundle that binds armadillo repeats 10
to 12 and a C-terminal tail that, like TCF and E-cadherin, binds in the
groove formed by armadillo repeats 5 to 9 of CTNNB1. Graham et al.
(2002) showed that ICAT selectively inhibits CTNNB1/TCF binding in vivo,
without disrupting CTNNB1/cadherin interactions. They concluded that it
should be possible to design cancer therapeutics that inhibit
CTNNB1-mediated transcriptional activation without interfering with cell
adhesion.

Daniels and Weis (2002) determined the crystal structure of ICAT bound
to the armadillo repeat domain of CTNNB1. ICAT contains an N-terminal
helical domain that binds to repeats 11 and 12 of CTNNB1, and an
extended C-terminal region that binds to repeats 5 to 10 in a manner
similar to that of TCFs and other CTNNB1 ligands.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Mental Retardation, Autosomal Dominant 19

In 3 patients with severe intellectual disability, microcephaly, and
spasticity, de Ligt et al. (2012) identified heterozygous
loss-of-function mutations in the CTNNB1 gene (116806.0017-116806.0019).
Two of the mutations were known to be de novo; in the third patient, the
mutation was not inherited from the mother and the father's DNA was not
available for testing.

- Somatic Mutations

Morin et al. (1997) found a total of 3 tumors that contained CTNNB1
mutations that altered potential phosphorylation sites. Each mutation
was somatic and appeared to affect only 1 of the 2 CTNNB1 alleles.
Causative mutations were heterozygous. The authors hypothesized that the
mutations might exert a dominant effect, rendering a fraction of
cellular beta-catenin insensitive to APC-mediated downregulation. Thus,
disruption of APC-mediated regulation of beta-catenin/TCF-regulated
transcription is critical for colorectal tumorigenesis. This is most
commonly achieved by recessive inactivating mutations of both APC
alleles, but can also be achieved by dominant mutations of CTNNB1 that
render CRT insensitive to the effects of wildtype APC.

Ilyas et al. (1997) found 5 different mutations in 21 colorectal cancer
cell lines (26%) from 19 patients: a 3-bp deletion from codon 45 and
single-nucleotide missense mutations involving codons 33, 183, 245, and
287. All 23 cell lines studied had full-length beta-catenin protein that
was detectable by Western blotting and that coprecipitated with
E-cadherin. In 3 of the cell lines with CTNNB1 mutations, complexes of
beta-catenin with alpha-catenin and APC were detectable; in 2 other cell
lines, complexes were not detected.

Rubinfeld et al. (1997) detected abnormally high amounts of beta-catenin
in 7 of 26 human melanoma cell lines. Unusual messenger RNA splicing and
missense mutations in the CTNNB1 gene that result in stabilization of
the protein were identified in 6 of the 7 lines, and the APC gene was
altered or missing in 2 others. In the APC-deficient cells, ectopic
expression of wildtype APC eliminated the excess beta-catenin. Cells
with stabilized beta-catenin contained a constitutive beta-catenin/Lef1
complex. Thus, Rubinfeld et al. (1997) concluded that genetic defects
that result in upregulation of beta-catenin may play a role in melanoma
progression.

In a review of hereditary cancer syndromes, Fearon (1997) presented a
useful diagram illustrating how the APC protein regulates beta-catenin
levels in normal cells and how mutations in APC and CTNNB in cancer cell
genes deregulate cell growth via T-cell transcription factor-7-like-2.

Chan et al. (1999) studied 16 human pilomatricomas (132600) and found
CTNNB1 mutations in 12 of them. The mutations occurred in the
amino-terminal segment, normally involved in phosphorylation-dependent,
ubiquitin-mediated degradation, and thus are beta-catenin-stabilizing
mutations. The authors concluded that the 75% mutation rate directly
implicates beta-catenin/LEF misregulation as the major cause of hair
matrix cell tumorigenesis in humans.

Sagae et al. (1999) analyzed 61 primary ovarian carcinomas (167000),
consisting of 49 nonendometrioid-type tumors and 12 endometrioid tumors,
for genetic alteration of the CTNNB1 gene. In 5 carcinomas, including 4
(33%) of the endometrioid-type tumors and 1 (14%) of 7 mucinous-type
tumors, they found 3 somatic CTNNB1 mutations (see, e.g., 116806.0012).
All of the mutations caused alterations at the serine/threonine residues
that are potential sites of phosphorylation of GSK3-beta (GSK3B;
605004). Immunohistochemical studies were performed in 27 of the 61
ovarian carcinomas. Expression of both nuclear and cytoplasmic
beta-catenin was demonstrated in 4 of these 27 ovarian carcinomas for
which tissue samples were available for examination. Sagae et al. (1999)
concluded that the CTNNB1 mutations at potential GSK3B phosphorylation
sites result in accumulation of beta-catenin protein within cells and
its translocation to nuclei.

Wright et al. (1999) identified somatic mutations within exon 3 of the
CTNNB1 gene in 10 of 63 (16%) endometrioid ovarian carcinomas. The
mutations all resulted in missense changes within the GSK3-beta
consensus site.

Hepatoblastoma, a rare malignant tumor of the liver that occurs in
children at an average age of 2 to 3 years, represents the most frequent
malignant liver tumor in childhood. Although most cases are sporadic,
the incidence is highly elevated in patients with familial APC. These
patients carry germline mutations of the APC gene, which controls the
degradation of the CTNNB1 gene product after its NH2-terminal
phosphorylation on serine/threonine residues. APC, as well as CTNNB1, is
a central effector of the growth-promoting 'wingless' signaling pathway
in development. To determine whether this pathway is involved in the
pathogenesis of sporadic hepatoblastomas, Koch et al. (1999) examined 52
biopsies and 3 cell lines from sporadic hepatoblastomas for mutations in
the APC and CTNNB1 genes. In 48% of sporadic hepatoblastomas they found
CTNNB1 mutations (116806.0003-116806.0005). The mutations affected exon
3, which encodes the degradation targeting box of CTNNB1, and led to
accumulation of intracytoplasmic and nuclear beta-catenin protein. In
all, 11 point mutations and 5 small interstitial deletions of 24 to 102
bp were found. Eight point mutations abolished serine or threonine
phosphorylation sites. An increased transcriptional activity was
demonstrated in vitro for CTNNB1 forms carrying similar mutations in
exon 3.

A major function of APC is the downregulation of beta-catenin, a
transcription-activating protein with oncogenic potential. Molecular
genetic studies suggest that inactivation of the APC tumor suppressor
may be involved in hepatoblastoma tumorigenesis. In an ongoing
immunohistochemical study of beta-catenin expression in sporadic cases
of tumor types that are associated with adenomatous polyposis coli,
Blaker et al. (1999) observed increased beta-catenin levels in the
cytoplasm and in the nuclei of 3 hepatoblastomas. Sequencing of exon 3
of the CTNNB1 gene revealed an activating mutation in one of the tumor
samples (116806.0003). Thus, beta-catenin accumulation may play a role
in the development of hepatoblastoma and heterozygous activating
mutations of the CTNNB1 gene may substitute for biallelic APC
inactivation in this tumor type.

Legoix et al. (1999) found an activating beta-catenin mutation in exon 3
in 18% of cases of hepatocellular carcinoma. Among tumors lacking a
beta-catenin mutation, no APC mutation had been detected in a subset of
30 cases tested. The correlation between beta-catenin mutation status
and chromosome segment deletions was studied on a set of 48 hyperploid
tumors. Chromosome 1p, 4q, and 16p deletions were significantly
associated with the absence of beta-catenin mutation. The results
suggested the existence of 2 mechanisms of carcinogenesis: first, a
beta-catenin activating mutation associated with a low rate of loss of
heterozygosity; a second, operating in a context of chromosomal
instability, would involve tumor suppressor genes.

Huang et al. (2000) screened 46 sporadic medulloblastomas for the
presence of mutations in genes of the Wnt signaling pathway (APC and
beta-catenin). Four tumors were found to have miscoding beta-catenin
mutations, 3 of which were located at codon 33 (ser33 to phe;
116806.0007).

In desmoid tumor tissue (see 135290), Shitoh et al. (1999) identified a
somatic thr41-to-ala mutation (116806.0003) in the beta-catenin gene.

Among 166 lung cancers (90 primary tumors and 76 cell lines), 1
blastoma, and 10 malignant mesotheliomas (156240) (2 primary tumors and
8 cell lines), Shigemitsu et al. (2001) identified 4 alterations in exon
3 of the CTNNB1 gene. Among 10 malignant mesotheliomas, they identified
in 1 cell line a homozygous deletion of the entire gene except for exon
1.

Wheeler et al. (2002) examined the possible contribution of beta-catenin
to sporadic small intestinal adenocarcinoma. Beta-catenin protein
expression was assessed immunohistochemically in a total of 21
nonfamilial, nonampullary small intestinal adenocarcinomas. Ten (48%)
showed decreased expression at the cell membrane and increased nuclear
staining; this contrasted with the usual pattern of protein expression
in normal colonic epithelium, where nuclear expression is undetectable
using immunohistochemical techniques. The authors also screened the
mutation cluster region of the APC gene and found no mutations, leading
them to suggest that increased nuclear localization of beta-catenin may
reflect gain-of-function mutation, similar to that seen in up to 25% of
colorectal cancers (Ilyas et al., 1997).

As noted, inactivating mutations of the APC gene or activating mutations
of the CTNNB1 gene initiate colorectal neoplasia. To address the
biochemical and physiologic effects of mutant beta-catenin, Chan et al.
(2002) disrupted either the mutant or wildtype CTNNB1 allele in a human
colorectal cancer cell line. Cells with only wildtype beta-catenin had
decreased colony-forming ability when plated at low density, although
their growth was similar to that of parental cells when passaged under
routine conditions. Immunohistochemistry and cell-fractionation studies
suggested that mutant beta-catenin activity was distinguished primarily
by cellular localization and not by protein degradation. Unexpectedly,
they found that mutant beta-catenin bound less well to E-cadherin (CDH1;
192090) than did wildtype beta-catenin, and the membranous localization
of wildtype and mutant beta-catenin was accordingly distinct. These
findings were considered to pose serious challenges to the current
models of APC/beta-catenin function.

Moreno-Bueno et al. (2001) analyzed the expression pattern of
beta-catenin in normal anagen hair follicles and in 40 human
pilomatrixomas by immunohistochemistry. In 11 of these tumors they also
studied exon 3 beta-catenin gene mutations by PCR and direct sequencing.
As these mutations have been related to a replication error (RER)
phenotype in other tumor types, Moreno-Bueno et al. (2001) explored
whether or not this association also occurs in pilomatrixomas.
Beta-catenin was expressed in the cell membranes of the outer and inner
root sheaths and in matrix cells located at the base and periphery of
the hair follicle bulb. However, central matrix cells that differentiate
into cortical cells, cortical, and cuticular cells expressed
beta-catenin in the nucleus, suggesting a role in signal transduction.
In addition, some fibroblasts of the dermal papilla also showed nuclear
expression of beta-catenin. All 40 analyzed pilomatrixomas showed
intense nuclear and cytoplasmic beta-catenin expression in proliferating
matrix (basaloid) cells. In areas of maturation, transitional cells
mainly showed cytoplasmic and membranous expression of beta-catenin,
while only a few cells retained nuclear expression. Shadow or ghost
cells did not show beta-catenin expression. Three of 11 tumors (26%) had
beta-catenin mutations. All 3 had the same heterozygous missense
mutation: a G-to-T change affecting the first nucleotide at codon 32
(116806.0016). None of the 11 tumors studied had a positive RER
phenotype. Moreno-Bueno et al. (2001) concluded that the
Wnt/Ctnnb1/Tcf-Lef pathway is activated in normal matrix cells of the
hair follicle to induce differentiation to the hair shaft. Additionally,
the beta-catenin mutation in matrix cells of the hair follicle
stabilizes beta-catenin protein, which translocates into the nucleus,
where it activates gene transcription together with lymphoid enhancer
factor-1 (153245)-producing pilomatrixoma. These mutations occur without
an underlying defect in DNA mismatch repair.

ANIMAL MODEL

An effector of intercellular adhesion, beta-catenin also functions in
Wnt signaling, associating with Lef1/Tcf DNA-binding proteins to form a
transcription factor. Gat et al. (1998) reported that this pathway also
operates in keratinocytes and that mice expressing beta-catenin
controlled by an epidermal promoter undergo a process resembling de novo
hair morphogenesis. The new follicles form sebaceous glands and dermal
papilla, normally established only in embryogenesis. As in
embryologically initiated hair germs, transgenic follicles induce Lef1,
but follicles are disoriented and defective in Sonic hedgehog
polarization. Additionally, proliferation continues unchecked, resulting
in 2 types of tumors (epithelioid cysts and trichofolliculomas) that are
also found in humans. Older transgenic mice develop pilomatricomas.
These findings suggested that transient beta-catenin stabilization may
be a key player in the epidermal signal leading to hair development and
implicated aberrant beta-catenin activation in hair tumors.

Harada et al. (1999) found that targeted deletion of exon 3 in mice,
which encodes serines and threonines phosphorylated by GSK3-beta, caused
adenomatous intestinal polyps resembling those in Apc knockout mice.
Some nascent microadenomas were also found in the colon.

To study the role of beta-catenin in skin development, Huelsken et al.
(2001) introduced a conditional mutation of the gene in the epidermis
and hair follicles of mice using Cre/loxP technology. When beta-catenin
was mutated during embryogenesis, formation of placodes that generate
hair follicles was blocked. The authors showed that beta-catenin is
required genetically downstream of Tabby (300450) and downless (EDAR;
604095) and upstream of bone morphogenetic proteins (see 112262) and Shh
(600725) in placode formation. If beta-catenin was deleted after hair
follicles had formed, hair was completely lost after the first hair
cycle. Further analysis demonstrated that beta-catenin is essential for
fate decisions of skin stem cells: in the absence of beta-catenin, stem
cells failed to differentiate into follicular keratinocytes and instead
adopted an epidermal fate.

Saadi-Kheddouci et al. (2001) found that transgenic mice that
overproduced an oncogenic form of beta-catenin in the epithelial cells
of the kidney developed severe polycystic lesions soon after birth.

To examine whether activating beta-catenin signaling could regulate
mammalian brain development, Chenn and Walsh (2002) developed transgenic
mice overexpressing an amino-terminal truncated form of beta-catenin
fused at the carboxyl-terminal with green fluorescent protein in
neuroepithelial precursors. The mice developed enlarged brains with
increased cerebral cortical surface area and folds resembling sulci and
gyri of higher mammals. Brains from transgenic animals have enlarged
lateral ventricles lined with neuroepithelial precursor cells,
reflecting an expansion of the precursor population. Compared with
wildtype precursors, a greater proportion of transgenic precursors
reenter the cell cycle after mitosis. Chenn and Walsh (2002) concluded
that their results showed that beta-catenin can function in the decision
of precursors to proliferate or differentiate during mammalian neuronal
development and suggested that beta-catenin can regulate cerebral
cortical size by controlling the generation of neuronal precursor cells.

Lickert et al. (2002) conditionally inactivated the beta-catenin gene in
cells of structures that exhibit organizer functions in mouse embryos:
the visceral endoderm, the node, the notochord, and the definitive
endoderm. Mesoderm formation was not affected in mutant embryos, but the
node was missing, patterning of the head and trunk was affected, and no
notochord or somites were formed. Deletion of beta-catenin in the
definitive endoderm led to the formation of multiple hearts along the
anterior-posterior axis of the embryo. Ectopic hearts developed in
parallel with the normal heart in regions of ectopic Bmp2 expression.
Lickert et al. (2002) concluded that ablation of beta-catenin in
embryonic endoderm changes cell fate from endoderm to precardiac
mesoderm.

By conditional gene ablation in mice, Soshnikova et al. (2003) found
that Wnt signaling is a key regulator of formation of the apical
ectodermal ridge (AER) and the dorsal-ventral axis of the limbs. They
generated compound mutants and showed that beta-catenin acts downstream
of BMP receptor-1A (BMPR1A; 601299) in AER induction, but upstream or
parallel in dorsal-ventral patterning. Soshnikova et al. (2003)
concluded that AER formation and dorsal-ventral patterning of limbs is
tightly controlled by Wnt/beta-catenin and BMP receptor signaling.

In mice bred to have T cells lacking Ctnnb1, Xu et al. (2003) observed a
substantial reduction in the number of splenic T cells. Splenic T cells
from these mice responded poorly to T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation
but showed no signs of enhanced cell death. Analysis of thymic
development suggested that Ctnnb1 deletion affected pre-TCR signaling in
double-negative thymocytes and impaired T-cell development at the level
of the beta selection checkpoint.

Day et al. (2005) found that ectopic canonical Wnt signaling led to
enhanced ossification and suppression of chondrocyte formation in mice.
Conversely, genetic inactivation of beta-catenin caused ectopic
formation of chondrocytes at the expense of osteoblast differentiation
during both intramembranous and endochondral ossification.

By conditional deletion of beta-catenin in mouse limb and head
mesenchyme, Hill et al. (2005) found that beta-catenin was required for
osteoblast lineage differentiation. Osteoblast precursors lacking
beta-catenin were blocked in differentiation and developed into
chondrocytes. Further experiments showed that beta-catenin activity was
necessary and sufficient to repress the differentiation of mesenchymal
cells into skeletal precursors.

Glass et al. (2005) engineered mice harboring either gain-of-function or
loss-of-function beta-catenin mutations targeted to osteoblasts. These
mice developed high and low bone mass phenotypes, respectively, caused
primarily by modification of bone resorption. Molecular analysis
revealed that canonical Wnt signaling controlled this process by
regulating expression of Opg (TNFRSF11B; 602643) within osteoblasts.
Glass et al. (2005) concluded that canonical Wnt signaling in
osteoblasts is a major negative regulator of bone resorption.

Using a gerbil model of gastritis and gastric cancer, Franco et al.
(2005) showed that in vivo adaptation of Helicobacter pylori by multiple
passages allowed a more rapid and reproducible induction of gastric
dysplasia and adenocarcinoma. The oncogenic H. pylori strain selectively
activated Ctnnb in gastric epithelia in a manner dependent on
translocation of bacterial CagA into host epithelial cells. Ctnnb
nuclear accumulation was increased in gastric epithelium from gerbils
infected with the carcinogenic H. pylori strain, as well as in persons
carrying Cag-positive versus Cag-negative bacterial strains or
uninfected persons. Franco et al. (2005) proposed that H. pylori-induced
dysregulation of CTNNB may explain, at least in part, the augmented risk
of gastric cancer after infection with this pathogen.

Zamora et al. (2007) found that conditional deletion of beta-catenin in
mouse proepicardium led to impaired formation of coronary arteries,
whereas the venous system and microvasculature of mutant mice were
normal. Mutant mice exhibited impaired epicardial development, including
failed expansion of the subepicardial space, blunted invasion of the
myocardium, and impaired differentiation of epicardium-derived
mesenchymal cells into coronary smooth muscle cells.

After amputation, freshwater planarians properly regenerate a head or
tail from the resulting anterior or posterior wound. Gurley et al.
(2008) found that in the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea, RNA
interference (RNAi) of beta-catenin or dishevelled (601365) causes the
inappropriate regeneration of a head instead of a tail at posterior
amputations. Conversely, RNAi of the beta-catenin antagonist adenomatous
polyposis coli (APC; 611731) results in the regeneration of a tail at
anterior wounds. In addition, the silencing of beta-catenin is
sufficient to transform the tail of uncut adult animals into a head.
Gurley et al. (2008) suggested that beta-catenin functions as a
molecular switch to specify and maintain anteroposterior identity during
regeneration and homeostasis in planarians.

Petersen and Reddien (2008) independently performed experiments similar
to those described by Gurley et al. (2008) and identified a single gene,
which they called Smed-beta-catenin, that defines the character of the
anterioposterior axis throughout the Bilateria and specifies
regeneration polarity in planarians.

Liu et al. (2009) ablated beta-catenin specifically in the Sf1 (NR5A1;
601516)-positive population of mouse somatic cells and showed that
beta-catenin was present in gonads of both sexes but was necessary only
for ovarian differentiation but dispensable for testis development. Loss
of beta-catenin in fetal testes did not affect Sertoli cell
differentiation, testis morphogenesis, or masculinization of the
embryos. However, there were molecular and morphologic defects in
ovaries lacking beta-catenin, including formation of testis-specific
coelomic vessel, appearance of androgen-producing adrenal-like cells,
and loss of female germ cells. These phenotypes were strikingly similar
to those found in the Rspo1 (609595)- and Wnt4 (603490)-knockout
ovaries. In the absence of beta-catenin, expression of Wnt4 was
downregulated, while that of Rspo1 was not affected, placing
beta-catenin as a component in between Rspo1 and Wnt4.

Adrenocortical carcinoma (ADCC; 202300) is a rare but aggressive cancer.
Constitutive activation of beta-catenin is the most frequent alteration
in benign and malignant adrenocortical tumors in humans. Berthon et al.
(2010) showed that constitutive activation of beta-catenin in the
adrenal cortex of transgenic mice resulted in progressive steroidogenic
and undifferentiated spindle-shaped cell hyperplasia as well as
dysplasia of the cortex and medulla. Over 17 months, transgenic adrenals
developed malignant characteristics such as uncontrolled
neovascularization and loco-regional metastatic invasion. These
oncogenic events were accompanied by ectopic differentiation of
glomerulosa at the expense of fasciculata cells, which caused primary
hyperaldosteronism. Berthon et al. (2010) concluded that constitutively
active beta-catenin is an adrenal oncogene, which may trigger benign
aldosterone-secreting tumor development and promote malignancy.

COLORECTAL CANCER, SOMATIC
CTNNB1, 3-BP DEL, SER45DEL

In 2 colorectal cancer (see 114500) cell lines that expressed
full-length APC, yet had escaped inhibition of transcriptional
activation mediated by beta-catenin and TCF7L2, Morin et al. (1997)
found a mutation in a downstream component of the APC tumor suppressor
pathway, namely in the CTNNB1 gene. Each tumor line had a different
mutation: a 3-bp deletion that removed an amino acid (ser45) in one and
a C-to-A missense mutation that changed ser33 to tyr (116806.0002) in
the other. Analysis of paraffin-embedded archival tissue from the first
patient confirmed the somatic nature of this mutation and its presence
in the primary tumor before culture. Both mutations affected serines
that have been implicated in the downregulation of beta-catenin through
phosphorylation.

See 116806.0001 and Morin et al. (1997). One of the 5 point mutations
found by Ilyas et al. (1997) in colorectal cancer (see 114500) cell
lines was a ser33-to-tyr mutation due to a C-to-A transversion in exon 3
of the CTNNB1 gene. The mutation was present in heterozygous form.

Chan et al. (1999) identified this mutation in 2 of 16 pilomatricomas
(132600).

CTNNB1, THR41ALA

In 6 sporadic hepatoblastomas (see 114550), Koch et al. (1999) found an
A-to-G transition in codon 41 of the CTNNB1 gene, resulting in a
thr41-to-ala (T41A) substitution. (Iwao et al. (1998) described codon 41
mutations in sporadic colorectal carcinomas.) The ages of the patients
with the T41A mutation and hepatoblastoma ranged from 4 to 27 months.

In a hepatoblastoma, Blaker et al. (1999) demonstrated intense
cytoplasmic beta-catenin staining compared to adjacent normal liver
tissue and accumulation of beta-catenin in the tumor cell nuclei.
Furthermore, the tumor in one case was found to be heterozygous for an
A-to-G transition converting codon 41 from ACC (thr) to GCC (ala).
Legoix et al. (1999) found this same mutation in 3 cases of
hepatocellular carcinoma. Rather than being childhood cases, these were
adults (mean age 58 years; range, 27 to 76 years). In the group of 98
cases, many of the subjects were alcoholics.

Shitoh et al. (1999) identified a somatic T41A mutation in the CTNNB1
gene within desmoid tumor tissue derived from a patient with sporadic
disease (see 135290).

MENTAL RETARDATION, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT 19
CTNNB1, 4-BP DEL, NT1272

In a 29-year-old woman with severe intellectual disability, short
stature, microcephaly, dysmorphic facial features, and spasticity
(MRD19; 615075), de Ligt et al. (2012) identified a 4-bp deletion
(1272_1275del) in the CTNNB1 gene, resulting in a frameshift
(Ser425ThrfsTer11). This mutation was not identified in either parent.
The authors noted that this patient also had a heterozygous missense
mutation in the ARFGEF2 gene (605371; R802Q). Mutations in the ARFGEF2
gene are known to cause intellectual disability but are inherited in an
autosomal recessive manner.

602623	TITLE *602623 FK506-BINDING PROTEIN 5; FKBP5
;;FK506-BINDING PROTEIN, 51-KD; FKBP51;;
FKBP54
DESCRIPTION For background information on FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs), see FKBP1A
(186945).

CLONING

Nair et al. (1997) cloned a cDNA for human FKBP51 from a HeLa cell cDNA
library. The FKBP51 cDNA encodes a predicted 457-amino acid polypeptide
with 90% identity to mouse fkbp51 and 55% identity to FKBP52 (600611).
Baughman et al. (1997) cloned a cDNA encoding human FKBP51 by screening
a human thymus cDNA library with a fragment of the murine Fkbp51 cDNA.
The human FKBP51 cDNA encodes a deduced 457-amino acid protein that
shows 87% sequence identity to the mouse protein. Northern blot analysis
revealed that treatment of leukemic T cells with glucocorticoids results
in a marked increase in expression of a 3.7-kb transcript. Western blot
analysis showed that unlike the predominant T-cell expression of the
mouse protein, FKBP51 is expressed as a 51-kD protein in a variety of
tissues but not in brain, colon, or lung. The expression is frequently
in molar excess of that of FKBP12 (FKBP1A; 186945), but its capacity to
inhibit calcineurin is significantly lower than that of FKBP1A.

Baughman et al. (1995) and Yeh et al. (1995) cloned and characterized
the mouse Fkbp51 gene. Baughman et al. (1995) isolated the gene based on
its induction during glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis in murine thymoma
cells. Murine Fkbp51 encodes a 456-amino acid polypeptide with a
predicted mass of 51 kD. Yeh et al. (1995) isolated the mouse gene based
on the selective accumulation of its transcript during adipocyte
differentiation. By Northern blot analysis, the gene is expressed in a
variety of tissues, with highest levels in liver, skeletal muscle, and
kidney.

MAPPING

International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the FKBP51 gene
to chromosome 6 (TMAP RH47153).

GENE FUNCTION

By Western blot analysis, Baughman et al. (1995) showed that the murine
Fkbp51 gene is expressed in all tissues, most abundantly in T
lymphocytes and in the thymus. Baughman et al. (1995) showed that FKBP5
has PPIase activity and is inhibited by rapamycin and FK520, a
structural analog that is virtually identical to FK506. Yeh et al.
(1995) showed that the PPIase activity of murine Fkbp51 is inhibited by
FK506 but not by cyclosporin A.

Nair et al. (1997) showed that FKBP51 is inhibited by FK506 but not by
cyclosporine. The authors demonstrated that FKBP51 and FKBP52 bind to
Hsp90 (140571) in a competitive manner. Nair et al. (1997) also showed
that Hsp90, Hsp70 (140550), and p23 (607061), a component of the
progesterone receptor complex, bind directly or indirectly to FKBP51.

Vermeer et al. (2003) studied whether the glucocorticoid-induced
increase of the mRNA encoding FKBP5 could be used for the development of
a novel assay, ultimately to be used in native human peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Glucocorticoid addition to human
lymphoblastoid cells resulted in a dose-dependent increase of FKBP5 mRNA
levels within 2 hours, followed by a further increase until 24 hours.
Northern blot analysis and real-time PCR yielded similar results.
Coincubation of glucocorticoids with the glucocorticoid receptor
(138040) antagonist ORG34116 or the protein synthesis inhibitor
cycloheximide suggested a direct, glucocorticoid receptor-mediated
upregulation of FKBP5 gene transcription. They concluded that the
induction of FKBP5 mRNA by glucocorticoids may be a suitable marker to
assess individual glucocorticoid sensitivity, the in vitro measurement
of glucocorticoid potency, and the in vivo determination of
glucocorticoid bioavailability.

Using gene expression microarrays, Woodruff et al. (2007) found that
CLCA1 (603906), periostin (POSTN; 608777), and SERPINB2 (PAI2; 173390)
were upregulated in airway epithelial cells of individuals with asthma
(see 600807), but not smokers. Corticosteroid treatment downregulated
expression of these 3 genes and upregulated expression of FKBP51. High
baseline expression of CLCA1, POSTN, and SERPINB2 was associated with a
good clinical response to corticosteroids, whereas high expression of
FKBP51 was associated with a poor response.

Tissing et al. (2007) found that 8 hours of prednisolone treatment
altered expression of 51 genes in leukemic cells from children with
precursor-B- or T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia compared with nonexposed
cells. The 3 most highly upregulated genes were FKBP5, ZBTB16 (176797),
and TXNIP (606599), which were upregulated 35.4-, 8.8-, and 3.7-fold,
respectively.

Attwood et al. (2011) demonstrated in mice that the serine protease
neuropsin (60564) is critical for stress-related plasticity in the
amygdala by regulating the dynamics of the EphB2 (600997)-NMDA receptor
interaction, the expression of Fkbp5, and anxiety-like behavior. Stress
results in neuropsin-dependent cleavage of EphB2 in the amygdala,
causing dissociation of EphB2 from the NR1 (138249) subunit of the NMDA
receptor and promoting membrane turnover of EphB2 receptors. Dynamic
EphB2-NR1 interaction enhances NMDA receptor current, induces Fkpb5 gene
expression, and enhances behavioral signatures of anxiety. On stress,
neuropsin-deficient mice do not show EphB2 cleavage and its dissociation
from NR1, resulting in a static EphB2-NR1 interaction, attenuated
induction of the Fkbp5 gene, and low anxiety. The behavioral response to
stress can be restored by intraamygdala injection of neuropsin into
neuropsin-deficient mice and disrupted by the injection of either
anti-EphB2 antibodies or silencing the Fkbp5 gene in the amygdala of
wildtype mice. Attwood et al. (2011) concluded that their findings
established a novel neuronal pathway linking stress-induced proteolysis
of EphB2 in the amygdala to anxiety.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The stress hormone-regulating hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis
has been implicated in the causality as well as the treatment of
depression (608516). To investigate a possible association between genes
regulating the HPA axis and response to antidepressants and
susceptibility for depression, Binder et al. (2004) genotyped
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 8 of these genes in depressed
individuals and matched controls. They found significant associations of
response to antidepressants and the recurrence of depressive episodes
with SNPs in FKBP5, a glucocorticoid receptor-regulating cochaperone of
hsp90 (see 140571), in 2 independent samples. These SNPs were also
associated with increased intracellular FKBP5 protein expression, which
triggers adaptive changes in glucocorticoid receptor and, thereby, HPA
axis regulation. Individuals carrying the associated genotypes had less
HPA-axis hyperactivity during the depressive episode. Binder et al.
(2004) proposed that the FKBP5 variant-dependent alterations in HPA-axis
regulation could be related to the faster response to antidepressant
drug treatment and the increased recurrence of depressive episodes
observed in this group of depressed individuals. These findings
supported a central role of genes regulating the HPA axis in the
causality of depression and the mechanism of action of antidepressant
drugs.

In 294 individuals with major depressive disorder (608516) and 339
matched controls, Binder et al. (2004) found that individuals homozygous
for the T allele of a C/T polymorphism in the FKBP5 gene, dbSNP
rs1360780, had an accelerated response to antidepressants over 5 weeks
of treatment. The responses of CT heterozygotes and CC homozygotes were
significantly slower than those of TT homozygotes and were almost
identical to each other. The authors also found that individuals with
the TT genotype had experienced more than twice as many depressive
episodes before the index episode, suggesting that these individuals
have more lifetime depressive episodes in addition to their faster
response to antidepressant drugs.

610591	TITLE *610591 RHO GTPase-ACTIVATING PROTEIN 27; ARHGAP27
;;CIN85-ASSOCIATED MULTIDOMAIN-CONTAINING RhoGAP1; CAMGAP1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Rho (see ARHA; 165390)-like small GTPases are involved in many cellular
processes, and they are inactive in the GDP-bound state and active in
the GTP-bound state. GTPase-activating proteins, such as ARHGAP27,
inhibit Rho-like proteins by stimulating their intrinsic GTPase activity
(Katoh and Katoh, 2004).

CLONING

Sakakibara et al. (2004) cloned rat Arhgap27, which they called Camgap1,
and by database analysis, they identified human ARHGAP27. Both deduced
proteins contain an N-terminal SH3 domain, followed by 3 WW motifs, a
proline-rich region, a pleckstrin-homology (PH) domain, and a C-terminal
RhoGAP domain. Northern blot analysis of murine tissues detected highest
expression in kidney, lung, small intestine, and thymus.

By searching databases for sequences similar to ARHGAP12 (610577), Katoh
and Katoh (2004) cloned 2 variants of ARHGAP27 that differed in their
5-prime sequences due to utilization of alternative first exons. The
deduced proteins differed at their N-terminal ends. The full-length
protein contains 889 amino acids, and the N-terminally truncated protein
contains 548 amino acids.

GENE FUNCTION

By biochemical analysis, Sakakibara et al. (2004) determined that the
recombinant RhoGAP domain of rat Camgap1 induced the GTPase activity of
Rac1 (602048) and Cdc42 (116952), but not RhoA. Protein binding and
expression studies indicated that the second SH3 domain of CIN85
(SH3KBP1; 300374) bound to the proline-rich region of Camgap1.
Overexpression of the 3 WW domains of rat Camgap1, but not the
full-length protein, interfered with receptor (TFRC; 190010)-mediated
endocytosis of transferrin.

GENE STRUCTURE

Katoh and Katoh (2004) determined that the ARHGAP27 gene contains 18
exons and spans over 36.3 kb. Alternate first exons provide alternative
promoters.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Katoh and Katoh (2004) mapped the ARHGAP27
gene to chromosome 17q21.

606055	TITLE *606055 PHOSPHATIDYLCHOLINE TRANSFER PROTEIN; PCTP
;;START DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; STARD2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Phosphatidylcholine (PC) transfer protein (PCTP) is a cytosolic protein
first purified from bovine and rat liver that catalyzes intermembrane
transfer of PC. By searching an EST database for homologs of bovine
Pctp, followed by 5-prime RACE and PCR of a kidney cDNA library, Cohen
et al. (1999) obtained a cDNA encoding human PCTP. The deduced 214-amino
acid human protein is 76% and 80% identical to bovine and rat Pctp,
respectively. Northern blot analysis revealed wide expression of an
approximately 2.3-kb PCTP transcript in all tissues tested except
thymus. Highest expression was detected in liver, placenta, testis,
kidney, and heart, and lowest levels were found in brain and lung.

Van Helvoort et al. (1999) cloned human and mouse PCTP. They noted that
the sn2 fatty acyl-binding domain is 100% identical in the rodent,
bovine, and human proteins.

GENE STRUCTURE

Using Southern blot analysis, van Helvoort et al. (1999) determined that
PCTP is a single-copy gene. By genomic sequence analysis, Cohen et al.
(1999) showed that the PCTP gene contains 6 exons and spans 13 to 23 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Cohen et al. (1999) mapped the PCTP gene
to 17q21-q22. They localized the mouse gene to the central portion of
chromosome 11.

ANIMAL MODEL

Van Helvoort et al. (1999) disrupted the Pctp gene in mice. Pctp
knockout mice showed no defects in the secretion of PC into bile or lung
surfactant, and the lipid content and composition of bile and surfactant
was normal. The authors concluded that PCTP does not play a major role
in transporting PC from the endoplasmic reticulum, where it is
synthesized, to the hepatocyte canalicular membrane.

603873	TITLE *603873 PHOSPHOLIPASE A2-ACTIVATING PROTEIN; PLAA
;;PLAP
DESCRIPTION Phospholipase A2-activating protein (PLAP) is potentially important in
regulating the inflammatory response through its activation of
phospholipase A2 (e.g., 600522), which catalyzes the release of
arachidonic acid. By screening a human monocyte cDNA library with a
mouse Plap cDNA, Chopra et al. (1999) isolated human PLAP cDNAs. The
738-amino acid human PLAP protein predicted by the cDNA sequence has a
molecular mass of 80,826 kD; however, immunoblot analysis using
antibodies against PLAP detected a 72- to 74-kD protein in human
monocyte cell lysates. In mouse macrophages, an antisense Plap
oligonucleotide blocked cholera toxin-induced arachidonic acid release,
indicating a role for PLAP in the regulation of phospholipase A2
activation.

614428	TITLE *614428 TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR AP2-EPSILON; TFAP2E
;;AP2-EPSILON
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the AP2 family of transcription factors, such as TFAP2E,
contain an N-terminal activation domain and a C-terminal basic
helix-loop-helix dimerization and DNA-binding domain. AP2 proteins bind
to and regulate the promoters and enhancers of numerous genes involved
in a wide spectrum of physiologic processes during development, cell
cycle, and differentiation (summary by Tummala et al., 2003).

CLONING

Tummala et al. (2003) cloned full-length mouse Tfap2e, which they called
Ap2-epsilon, from skin RNA. They identified human AP2-epsilon by
database analysis. The mouse and human AP2-epsilon proteins both contain
442 amino acids, and they share 92% identity. Both have domain
structural characteristics of AP2 proteins, including a PY motif in the
N-terminal activation domain. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues
showed strong expression of an approximately 2.1-kb Ap2-epsilon
transcript in skin, with weak expression in stomach, and no expression
in other tissues examined. RT-PCR analysis detected AP2-epsilon
expression in human skin, primary human keratinocytes, and human
keratinocyte and cervical cancer cell lines.

GENE FUNCTION

Tummala et al. (2003) found that recombinant mouse Ap2-epsilon, like all
other AP2 proteins tested, bound the consensus AP2-binding site
(CCTGCAGGC) in the promoter regions of keratin-1 (KRT1; 139350) and
keratin-14 (KRT14; 148066). An N-terminally truncated Ap2-epsilon
protein also bound these keratin promoter sequences.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tummala et al. (2003) determined that the TFAP2E gene contains 7 exons
and spans over 23 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Tummala et al. (2003) mapped the TFAP2E
gene to chromosome 1p34.3.

607103	TITLE *607103 ARGINYLTRANSFERASE 1; ATE1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The N-end rule relates the in vivo half-life of a protein to the
identity of its N-terminal residue. N-terminal arginine is a primary
destabilizing residue for ubiquitin-dependent degradation, while
N-terminal aspartate and glutamate are secondary destabilizing residues
due to their role as substrates for arginylation by ATE1.

CLONING

Based on sequence similarity to mouse Ate1, Kwon et al. (1999)
identified human ATE1 within an EST clone and subsequently cloned 2
forms of ATE1 cDNA from human embryonic kidney cells. They determined
that the 2 variants of ATE1, which they termed ATE1-1 and ATE1-2, are
found in both human and mouse and result from the use of alternate
second exons. In mouse, both variants encode deduced 516-amino acid
proteins with calculated molecular masses of about 59 kD. The 43-residue
sequences encoded by the alternate exons are 31% identical. Northern
blot analysis of mouse tissues revealed a 5-kb transcript in all tissues
tested except testis, where the major transcript was 2 kb. Restriction
digests of the transcripts suggested that the ratio of Ate1-1 to Ate1-2
varies between tissues. Transfection of fluorescence-tagged Ate1-1 into
mouse fibroblasts resulted in both nuclear and cytosolic localization,
whereas Ate1-2 localization was exclusively cytosolic.

ANIMAL MODEL

Kwon et al. (2002) generated mice lacking ATE1. Ate1 -/- embryos died
with defects in heart development and in angiogenic remodeling of the
early vascular plexus. Through biochemical analyses, Kwon et al. (2002)
demonstrated that the N-terminal cysteine, in contrast to N-terminal
aspartate and glutamate, is oxidized before its arginylation by
R-transferase, suggesting that the arginylation branch of the N-end rule
pathway functions as an oxygen sensor. Ate1 +/- mice were apparently
normal, but Ate1 knockout embryos were pale and had thinner blood
vessels and frequent skin edema in embryonic days 9.5 to 12.5.
Hemorrhages were a consistent feature of homozygous mutant embryos and
were the likely proximal cause of death. Of 22 Ate1 -/- hearts examined
at embryonic days 13.5 to 15.5, about 85% had an atrial septal defect.
The atria were thin-walled with sparse trabeculae and a large atrial
septal defect. About 90% of examined Ate1-knockout embryonic hearts
exhibited hypoplasia of both the right and left ventricular myocardium.
The compact zone of the left ventricular myocardium was 2 or 3 cells
thick, in contrast to 7 to 10 cells in wildtype embryos. About 70% of
knockout Ate1 knockout mice had persistent truncus arteriosus, with the
common root of the aorta and pulmonary artery straddling a large ventral
septal defect. Vasculogenesis was normal at embryonic day 9.5, but
angiogenic remodeling was suppressed. Kwon et al. (2002) identified a
physiologic function for the posttranslational conjugation of arginine
to N-termini of proteins, a reaction first described by Kaji et al.
(1963). Kwon et al. (2002) also showed that the N-terminal cysteine
undergoes 2 covalent modifications, oxidation and arginylation, by the
N-end rule pathway. Methionine-aminopeptidases cleave off the N-terminal
methionine of the newly formed protein if a second residue is small
enough. Among the arginylatable residues, only cysteine satisfies this
condition.

In immunoprecipitation studies of embryonic fibroblasts from wildtype
and knockout mice deficient in the arginylation enzyme Ate1, Karakozova
et al. (2006) found that approximately 40% of intracellular beta-actin
(102630) is arginylated in vivo. In both wildtype and Ate1-null cells
beta-actin was stable, suggesting that arginylation does not induce
beta-actin degradation. Karakozova et al. (2006) found that arginylation
of beta-actin regulates cell motility. The majority of Ate1-null cells
appeared smaller than wildtype cells and were apparently unable to form
lamellae during movement along the substrate. Ate-null cells failed to
form normal lamellae during motility, resulting in their inability to
cover the same distance or occupy the same area of th substrate as the
control cells. In addition, Ate1-null cells exhibited apparent defects
in ruffling activity and cortical flow. Karakozova et al. (2006)
concluded that arginylation of beta-actin apparently represents a
critical step in the actin N-terminal processing needed for actin
functioning in vivo.

GENE FUNCTION

By stabilization assays and N-terminal sequencing of beta-galactosidase
substrate proteins, Kwon et al. (1999) found that both mouse Ate1-1 and
Ate1-2 conferred instability on asp-beta-galactosidase through
arginylation of the N-terminal asp. Cys-beta-galactosidase was a
less-efficient substrate.

The conjugation of arginine to proteins is a part of the N-end rule
pathway of protein degradation. Three N-terminal residues--aspartate,
glutamate, and cysteine--are arginylated by ATE1-encoded
arginyl-transferases. Hu et al. (2005) reported that oxidation of
N-terminal cysteine is essential for its arginylation. They showed that
the in vivo oxidation of N-terminal cysteine, before its arginylation,
requires nitric oxide, and reconstituted this process in vitro as well.
The levels of regulatory proteins bearing N-terminal cysteine, such as
RGS4 (602516), RGS5 (603276), and RGS16 (602514), were greatly increased
in mouse Ate1-null embryos, which lack arginylation. Stabilization of
these proteins, the first physiologic substrates of mammalian N-end rule
pathway, may underlie cardiovascular defects in Ate1-null embryos. Hu et
al. (2005) concluded that their findings identify the N-end rule pathway
as a new nitric oxide sensor that functions through its ability to
destroy specific regulatory proteins bearing N-terminal cysteine, at
rates controlled by nitric oxide and apparently by oxygen as well.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kwon et al. (1999) determined that the mouse Ate1 gene contains 3 exons.
Two alternate 129-bp regions, which are separated by 0.8 kb, are used as
exon 2.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By examining regions of chromosomes 7 and 12 containing low-copy repeats
of a sequence similar to C. elegans Dpy19, Carson et al. (2006)
identified DPY19L1 (613892), DPY19L2 (613893), and 6 related
pseudogenes. Database analysis revealed 2 additional human genes,
DPY19L3 (613894) and DPY19L4, as well as mouse orthologs of all 4
functional human genes. The deduced 723-amino acid human DPY19L4 protein
contains at least 9 transmembrane domains. RT-PCR of human tissues
revealed variable but ubiquitous DPY19L4 expression.

GENE STRUCTURE

Carson et al. (2006) determined that the DPY19L4 gene contains 18 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Carson et al. (2006) mapped the DPY19L4
gene to chromosome 8q22.1.

;;MINERALOCORTICOID RECEPTOR; MLR; MCR; MR;;
ALDOSTERONE RECEPTOR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mineralocorticoids, such as aldosterone, are mainly involved in the
maintenance of water and salt homeostasis by regulating vectorial sodium
transport in tight epithelia. Aldosterone has also been implicated in
other physiologic processes, including development of cardiac fibrosis
and differentiation of brown adipose tissue. NR3C2, or mineralocorticoid
receptor (MR), belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily and functions
as a ligand-dependent transcription factor that mediates the effects of
aldosterone on a variety of target tissues, including the distal parts
of the nephron, the distal colon, the cardiovascular and central nervous
systems, and brown adipose tissue. MR possesses the same affinity for
glucocorticoids as for mineralocorticoids, suggesting that it may also
function as a high-affinity glucocorticoid receptor (summary by Zennaro
et al., 2001).

CLONING

By low-stringency Southern analysis of placenta DNA using human
glucocorticoid receptor (GR, or GCCR; 138040) cDNA as probe, followed by
screening human kidney cDNA libraries, Arriza et al. (1987) cloned
NR3C2, which they called MR. The deduced 984-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 107 kD. Like glucocorticoid receptor,
mineralocorticoid receptor has an N-terminal cysteine-rich DNA-binding
region and a C-terminal steroid-binding domain separated by a putative
hinge region. Northern blot analysis of rat tissues detected Mr
expression in classic mineralocorticoid target tissues, such as kidney
and gut, as well as in brain, pituitary, and heart. It was also highly
expressed in hippocampus.

Using Western blot analysis, Alnemri et al. (1991) showed that human MR
was expressed in insect cells as 3 proteins with apparent molecular
masses of 115, 119, and 125 kD. These proteins were highly
phosphorylated. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that MR was primarily
cytoplasmic in the absence of aldosterone, and that activation by
aldosterone provoked translocation of the receptor to the nucleus.
Analytical gel filtration and sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation
revealed that MR associated in a complex of 9S to 10S, which was reduced
to about 4S following activation by aldosterone.

Zennaro et al. (1995) identified 2 splice variants of MR, called
MR-alpha and -beta, that contain alternative first exons. The coding
region beginning in exon 2 is identical in MR-alpha and -beta. Using in
situ hybridization with exon-specific probes, Zennaro et al. (1997)
detected expression of both variants in all typical human MR-expressing
cells and tissues analyzed. MR-alpha and -beta were present in distal
tubules of kidney, in cardiomyocytes, in enterocytes of colonic mucosa,
and in keratinocytes and sweat glands. Zennaro et al. (1997)
demonstrated that MR-alpha and -beta were coexpressed in aldosterone
target tissues.

Bloem et al. (1995) identified an MR splice variant in both human and
rat that contains an additional 12 nucleotides at the 3-prime end of
exon 3, resulting in a 4-amino acid insertion in the DNA-binding domain.
RT-PCR detected the short and long MR variants in all rat tissues
examined and in human white blood cell mRNA. The long transcript was
less abundant in all rat tissues except liver, where both transcripts
appeared equally expressed.

Using RT-PCR, Zennaro et al. (2001) identified 3 splice variants of MR
that were variably expressed in human tissues and cell lines:
full-length MR, a variant lacking exon 5, and a variant lacking both
exons 5 and 6, which they called MR-delta-5,6. The variant lacking exon
5 encodes a protein lacking part of the N-terminal DNA-binding domain
and all of the hinge region. Skipping of both exons 5 and 6 in
MR-delta-5,6 introduces a frameshift and a premature stop codon,
resulting in a 706-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass
of 75 kD. MR-delta-5,6 includes the complete N-terminal DNA-binding
region of full-length MR, but it has a novel 35-amino acid tail
replacing the hinge region and hormone-binding domain.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zennaro et al. (1995) determined that the human MR gene spans over
approximately 400 kb and contains 10 exons. Exons 1-alpha and 1-beta are
composed only of 5-prime untranslated sequence and splice into a common
translated region. The N-terminal part of the receptor is encoded by
exon 2; small exons 3 and 4 encode each of the 2 zinc fingers of the
DNA-binding domain. The hormone-binding domain is encoded by exons 5
through 9.

MAPPING

Arriza et al. (1987) mapped the NR3C2 gene to chromosome 4 by testing
their cDNA against a panel of rodent-human somatic cell hybrids. To
confirm the assignment to chromosome 4, they tested a restricted set of
microcell hybrids, each of which carries 1 to 3 human chromosomes. By in
situ hybridization using a biotinylated cDNA clone, Morrison et al.
(1989, 1990) regionalized the NR3C2 gene to 4q31.1; by the same method,
Fan et al. (1989) assigned NR3C2 gene to 4q31.2.

GENE FUNCTION

Expression studies by Arriza et al. (1987) demonstrated the ability of
MR to bind aldosterone with high affinity and to activate gene
transcription in response to aldosterone. MR also showed high affinity
for glucocorticoids. Arriza et al. (1987) speculated that, since the
circulating level of glucocorticoids is several times higher than those
of aldosterone, the primary mineralocorticoid, glucocorticoid activation
of MR may be functionally significant.

By assaying human MR overexpressed in insect cells, Alnemri et al.
(1991) showed that MR bound aldosterone, cortisol, cortexolone, and
progesterone with high affinity. MR bound immobilized DNA even as a
large inactive complex, and activation did not increase its DNA-binding
capacity.

Zennaro et al. (1995) found that expression of MR-beta was reduced in
sweat glands of 2 patients with mineralocorticoid abnormalities, one
with Conn syndrome and the other with Liddle syndrome (177200). However,
MR expression was not altered in a patient with type I
pseudohypoaldosteronism (see 177735).

The hormone-binding domain (HBD) of MR contains 4 cysteine residues,
C808, C849, C910, and C942, and Lupo et al. (1998) mutated each of these
into serine in an MR construct containing only the DNA-binding domain
(DBD), the hinge region, and the HBD. Most of these mutations altered
substrate affinity, but not substrate specificity, of the construct. The
C849S substitution reduced binding to aldosterone, and the C942S
substitution abrogated binding to all substrates tested. The wildtype
DBD-hinge-HBD construct showed about 20% of the transcriptional activity
of full-length MR in reporter gene assays. The C849S substitution
reduced the transcriptional activity of the construct, and the C942S
substitution inactivated the construct. Lupo et al. (1998) concluded
that C849 and C943 are critical for ligand binding of MR.

Using alanine scanning mutagenesis, Hellal-Levy et al. (2000) studied
the role of the residues of the loop connecting H11 and H12 in the
activation of the human mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). H950A retained
the ligand binding and transcriptional activities of the wildtype
receptor and interacted with coactivators. In contrast, F956A had no
receptor functions. Aldosterone bound to the mutant MRs (L952A, K953A,
V954A, E955A, P957A) with nearly the same affinity as to the wildtype
receptor and caused a receptor conformational change in these mutant MRs
as it does for the wildtype receptor. The authors proposed that the
integrity of the H11-H12 loop is crucial for folding the receptor into a
ligand-binding competent state and for establishing the network of
contacts that stabilize the active receptor conformation.

Zennaro et al. (2001) showed that in vitro-translated MR-delta-5,6
lacked the ability to bind aldosterone or dexamethasone. MR-delta-5,6
bound DNA and functioned as a ligand-independent transactivator of the
consensus glucocorticoid response element (GRE) from the mouse mammary
tumor virus promoter. MR-delta-5,6 did not interact with full-length MR,
but coexpression of MR-delta-5,6 increased the transactivation potential
of full-length MR or GR at high doses of hormone. In addition,
MR-delta-5,6 recruited the coactivators SRC1 (NCOA1; 602691), RIP140
(NRIP1; 602490), and TIF1-alpha (TRIM24; 603406), which enhanced its
transcriptional activity. Zennaro et al. (2001) concluded that
MR-delta-5,6 may modulate corticosteroid effects in target tissues.

Aldosterone enhances angiotensin II (see 106150)-induced PAI1 (173360)
expression in vitro. Sawathiparnich et al. (2003) tested the hypothesis
that angiotensin II type 1 and aldosterone receptor antagonism interact
to decrease PAI1 in humans. Effects of candesartan, spironolactone, or
combined candesartan/spironolactone on mean arterial pressure,
endocrine, and fibrinolytic variables were measured in 18 normotensive
subjects in whom the renin (179820)-angiotensin-aldosterone system was
activated by furosemide. This study evidenced an interactive effect of
endogenous angiotensin II and aldosterone on PAI1 production in humans.

Shibata et al. (2008) showed that a constitutively active RAC1 (602048)
mutant potentiated aldosterone-induced mineralocorticoid receptor
nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activity in HEK293 cells
transfected with human constructs. In cultured rat podocytes, activated
RAC1 facilitated mineralocorticoid receptor nuclear accumulation via
p21-activated kinase (PAK; see 602590) phosphorylation. Shibata et al.
(2008) found that mice lacking Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor-alpha
(ARHGDIA; 601925) developed progressive renal disease characterized by
heavy albuminuria and podocyte damage. These renal changes were
associated with increased Rac1 and mineralocorticoid receptor signaling
in the kidney without alteration in systemic aldosterone status.
Pharmacologic intervention with a Rac-specific small molecule inhibitor
diminished mineralocorticoid receptor overactivity and renal damage.
Furthermore, mineralocorticoid receptor blockade suppressed albuminuria
and histologic changes in Arhgdia -/- mice. Shibata et al. (2008)
concluded that RAC1 modulates mineralocorticoid receptor activity, and
that activation of the RAC1-mineralocorticoid receptor pathway has a
major role in the pathogenesis of renal damage.

Jeong et al. (2009) noted that aldosterone interacts with MR to activate
transcription of proinflammatory genes, in addition to activating
inflammatory signaling pathways in an MR-independent manner. They showed
that aldosterone triggered exocytosis of Weibel-Palade bodies from human
aortic endothelial cells, causing the release of proinflammatory
mediators. Small interfering RNA directed against MR reduced the effect
of aldosterone on exocytosis. Exocytosis also required calcium
signaling.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Some evidence has been presented that the mutation causing autosomal
recessive pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA) type I (264350) is located in
the MLR gene; however, this possibility was excluded by Chung et al.
(1995) by linkage analysis which demonstrated lod scores less than -2
over the whole region from D4S192 to D4S413 encompassing MLR. The
analysis was carried out in 10 inbred families using 3 simple sequence
length (SSL) polymorphisms spanning the MLR region; the approach
represented homozygosity mapping.

Although the studies of Chung et al. (1995) excluded MLR as the site of
the mutation causing autosomal recessive pseudohypoaldosteronism type I,
Geller et al. (1998) presented evidence that the autosomal dominant form
of the disorder (177735) can be caused by mutations in the MLR gene.
Autosomal dominant or sporadic PHA1 is a milder disease than the
autosomal recessive form and remits with age. Among 6 dominant and 7
sporadic PHA1 kindreds, Geller et al. (1998) found no mutations in the
epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) genes (600228, 600760) in which
mutations have been found in the autosomal recessive form of PHA1. As
ENaC activity in the kidney is regulated by aldosterone acting through
the mineralocorticoid receptor, Geller et al. (1998) screened the MLR
gene for variants and identified heterozygous mutations in 1 sporadic
and 4 dominant kindreds. These included 2 frameshift mutations (1 a de
novo mutation), 2 premature termination codons, and a splice donor
mutation.

Geller et al. (2000) screened the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) in 75
patients with early onset of severe hypertension (605115). A 15-year-old
boy with severe hypertension, suppressed plasma renin activity, low
serum aldosterone, and no other underlying cause of hypertension was
heterozygous for a missense mutation, resulting in substitution of a
leucine for serine at codon 810 (600983.0005). Of 23 relatives of the
proband, 11 were diagnosed with severe hypertension before age 20 years,
and the MR S810L mutation precisely cosegregated with early-onset
hypertension in this family. This mutation resulted in constitutive MR
activity and altered receptor specificity, with progesterone and other
steroids lacking 21-hydroxyl groups, normally MR antagonists, becoming
potent agonists.

In a Japanese patient with sporadic PHA, Arai et al. (2003) found 3
homozygous substitutions in the MR gene that had previously been
reported to occur in healthy populations. Luciferase activities induced
by MR were significantly lower for each of the 3 substitutions than
those for wildtype MR with aldosterone at 3 different concentrations..
Arai et al. (2003) suggested that 2 or more 'functional' polymorphisms,
any of which exhibits only slight effects on MR function alone and is
incapable of causing PHA, may in the right allelic combination induce
the negative salt conservation characteristic of PHA.

Sartorato et al. (2003) analyzed the NR3C2 gene in 14 families with
autosomal dominant or sporadic PHA1. They detected 6 heterozygous
mutations that differently affected protein structure and function. The
authors concluded that NR3C2 mutations are a common feature of autosomal
dominant PHA1, being found in 70% of their familial cases. Sartorato et
al. (2003) used the numbering of Arriza et al. (1987) to refer to the
mutations.

Pujo et al. (2007) identified 22 abnormalities of the NR3C2 gene in 33
patients with type 1 pseudohypoaldosteronism. Altogether, 68% of the
mutations were dominantly transmitted, while 18% were de novo mutations.

Riepe et al. (2006) detected 6 heterozygous NR3C2 mutations in 7
pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (PHA1) patients from 6 unrelated
families. Two frameshift mutations, 1131dupT (600983.0008) and 2871dupC
(600983.0006) had been reported. They also reported 2 novel nonsense
mutations and 2 missense mutations.

ANIMAL MODEL

Berger et al. (1998) generated MLR-deficient mice by gene targeting.
These mice had a normal prenatal development. During the first week of
life, the MLR-deficient mice developed symptoms of
pseudohypoaldosteronism. They lost weight and eventually died at
approximately 10 days after birth from dehydration by renal sodium and
water loss. At day 8, MLR -/- mice showed hyperkalemia, hyponatremia,
and a strong increase in renin, angiotensin II, and aldosterone plasma
concentrations. The fractional renal Na+ excretion was elevated more
than 8-fold. The glomerular filtration rate in MLR -/- mice was not
different from that in controls. The effect of amiloride on renal Na+
excretion in colonic transepithelial voltage reflected the function of
amiloride-sensitive epithelial Na+ channels.

Le Menuet et al. (2001) generated transgenic (TG) mice with the proximal
human MR promoter to drive expression of human MR in aldosterone target
tissues. Ribonuclease protection analysis revealed human MR expression
in mineralocorticoid-sensitive tissues, notably kidney and heart.
Histologic analysis showed that enlarged kidneys were associated with
renal tubular dilation and cellular vacuolization, the prevalence of
which increased with aging. Urinary potassium excretion rates were
decreased in the TG mice. Although blood pressure was normal, the TG
mice developed mild dilated cardiomyopathy accompanied by a significant
heart rate increase and an increase in cardiac ANP (NPPA; 108780), renal
and cardiac serum- and glucocorticoid-induced kinase (SGK; 602958), and
early growth response-1 (EGR1; 128990).

Berger et al. (2006) conditionally deleted the MR gene in the forebrain
of mice and screened them in various learning and exploration tests.
Mutant mice showed impaired learning of the water maze task and deficits
in measures of working memory on the radial maze due to behavioral
perseverance and stereotypy. They showed hyperactive exploration toward
novel objects but normal anxiety-like behavior. The behavioral changes
were associated with abnormalities of the mossy fiber projection and
upregulated glucocorticoid receptor (GCCR; 138040) expression in the
hippocampus. Adult mutant mice showed normal basal circadian
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity.

In a sporadic case of type I pseudohypoaldosteronism (177735), Geller et

In multiple subjects affected with type I pseudohypoaldosteronism

In affected subjects in a kindred with type I pseudohypoaldosteronism
(177735), Geller et al. (1998) found heterozygosity for a single-bp
deletion in the donor splice site following exon 5. The third basepair
of the splice donor site was deleted in the mutant allele so that gtagg
became gtgg.

HYPERTENSION, EARLY-ONSET, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT, WITH EXACERBATION IN
PREGNANCY
NR3C2, SER810LEU

Geller et al. (2000) screened the mineralocorticoid receptor in 75
patients with early onset of severe hypertension (605115). In a
15-year-old boy with severe hypertension, a C-to-T substitution,
changing codon 810 of the hormone-binding domain from a serine to a
leucine, was identified. The ser810-to-leu (S810L) mutation was
identified in heterozygous state in 11 family members of this proband
who had been diagnosed with severe hypertension before the age of 20
years, resulting in constitutive MR activity and altered receptor
specificity, with progesterone and other steroids lacking 21-hydroxyl
groups, normally MR antagonists, becoming potent agonists. This resulted
in profound exacerbation of hypertension during 5 pregnancies in 2
affected women in this kindred. Structural and biochemical studies
indicated that S810L results in the gain of a van der Waals interaction
between helix 5 and helix 3 that substitutes for interaction of the
steroid 21-hydroxyl group with helix 3 in the wildtype receptor. This
helix 5-helix 3 interaction is highly conserved among diverse nuclear
hormone receptors, suggesting its general role in receptor activation.
The effect of the S810L mutation was to invert the mineralocorticoid
receptor from aldosterone-responsive to progesterone-responsive, with
development of hypertension during pregnancy. This was the first
mendelian form of preeclampsia to be identified. Ordinarily, blood
pressure goes down during early stages of pregnancy.

NR3C2, 1-BP INS, 2871C

In a sporadic case of type I pseudohypoaldosteronism (177735), Viemann
et al. (2001) found a heterozygous insertion of a cytosine at position
2871 in exon 9. This mutation leads to a frameshift, which results in a
nonsense protein from codon 958 and a first stop codon at position 1012.

Riepe et al. (2006) detected this mutation in a patient with PHA1. They
showed that the receptor lacked aldosterone-binding and transactivation
capabilities because of a major change in receptor conformation.

NR3C2, LEU924PRO

Tajima et al. (2000) studied the molecular mechanisms of 1 Japanese
family with a renal form of PHA1 (177735). PCR and direct sequencing of
the mineralocorticoid receptor gene identified a heterozygous point
mutation changing codon 924, leucine (CTG) to CCG (proline) (L924P), in
all affected members. In vitro expression studies demonstrated that the
L924P mutation results in complete absence of MR function.

NR3C2, 1-BP INS, 1354T

In twins and their brother and mother in a family with PHA1 (177735),
Sartorato et al. (2003) found insertion of a thymine at nucleotide
position 1345 in exon 2 of the MR gene, resulting in frameshift and
premature termination of the receptor at amino acid 378 (E378X).

Riepe et al. (2006) detected this mutation in an Italian family. They
referred to the mutation as 1131dupT, with numbering beginning at the A
of the initiation codon.

.0009
PSEUDOHYPOALDOSTERONISM, TYPE I, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
NR3C2, 8-BP DEL, NT537

In a family with PHA1 (177735), Sartorato et al. (2003) found in 2 sibs
and their mother a deletion of 8 bp in exon 2 of the MR gene
(del8bp537). The frameshift resulted in a truncated protein with 8 novel
residues after ser104, followed by a premature stop codon.

.0010
PSEUDOHYPOALDOSTERONISM, TYPE I, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
NR3C2, CYS645TER

In a patient with PHA1 (177735), Sartorato et al. (2003) found a C-to-A
transversion at nucleotide 2157 in exon 4 of the MR gene that caused a
cys645-to-ter (C645X) truncation in the second zinc finger of the MR
DNA-binding domain. The mutation was apparently sporadic.

NR3C2, GLN776ARG

In a proband, her mother, and maternal grandfather with PHA1 (177735),
Sartorato et al. (2003) found an A-to-G transition at nucleotide 2549 in
exon 5 of the MR gene, changing gln776 to arg (Q776R) in the
ligand-binding domain of the mineralocorticoid receptor. Q776R mutant
protein displayed only 30% of maximal aldosterone binding.

NR3C2, GLY633ARG

In 2 brothers and all 4 of their offspring with PHA1 (177735), Sartorato
et al. (2003) found a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 2119, the last
nucleotide of exon 3, that caused substitution of gly633 with arg
(G633R). The G633R mutation exhibited reduced maximal transactivation,
although its binding characteristics and ED50 of transactivation were
comparable with those of wildtype MR.

.0013
PSEUDOHYPOALDOSTERONISM, TYPE I, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
NR3C2, LEU979PRO

In a proband and her mother with PHA1 (177735), Sartorato et al. (2003)
found a T-to-C transition at nucleotide 3158 in exon 9 of the MR gene,
resulting in a leu-to-pro change at codon 979 (L979P) in the
ligand-binding domain. L979P was shown to exert a transdominant-negative
effect on wildtype MR activity, and mutant protein demonstrated no
aldosterone-binding activity.

.0014
PSEUDOHYPOALDOSTERONISM, TYPE I, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
NR3C2, SER163TER

In a German patient with a renal form of PHA1 (177735), Riepe et al.
(2003) detected a heterozygous point mutation, 488C-G in exon 2 of the
NR3C2 gene, that resulted in substitution of a premature termination
codon for serine-163 (S163X). Segregation analysis revealed the same
mutation in the patient's father, who had shown no symptoms of PHA.
Riepe et al. (2003) sought polymorphisms in the amiloride-sensitive
epithelial sodium channel (ENaC; see 600228) as the basis of the
phenotypic differences within the family; sequencing revealed identical
ENaC haplotypes in the patient and his father, indicating that these
polymorphisms could not be responsible for the difference in clinical
presentation.

.0015
PSEUDOHYPOALDOSTERONISM, TYPE I, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
NR3C2, ARG947TER

In a Turkish infant with a renal form of PHA1 (177735), Riepe et al.
(2004) detected a heterozygous C-to-T transition at nucleotide 3055 in
exon 9 of the NR3C2 gene that caused premature termination of the
mineralocorticoid receptor at arginine-947 (R947X). The truncated
receptor was free of aldosterone binding. Segregation analysis revealed
the identical mutation in the patient's father, who was clinically free
of symptoms and showed normal plasma electrolytes and aldosterone
urinary metabolites and only slightly elevated plasma renin and
aldosterone levels. The authors concluded that their findings supported
the hypothesis that PHA1 due to NR3C2 mutations can show incomplete
penetrance, although a mild salt loss might have been overlooked in the
father's childhood.

In 2 families with autosomal dominant PHA1, unrelated to the family
described by Riepe et al. (2004), Fernandes-Rosa et al. (2006)
identified the R947X mutation. Different haplotypes segregated with the
mutation in each family, suggested that codon 947 is a mutation hotspot.

NR3C1, CYS436TER

In the index patient of a 5-generation Swedish family with 15 affected
members with autosomal dominant PHA1 (177735), Nystrom et al. (2004)
found a heterozygous T-to-A transversion at nucleotide 1308 in exon 2 of
the NR3C1 gene that caused premature termination of the
mineralocorticoid receptor at codon 436 (C436X). The mutation was found
to segregate with PHA1 in the family. Complete abrogation of the DNA-
and hormone-binding domains was predicted in the truncated mutant
protein. Interestingly, neuropathy was found in 2 of 5 affected
individuals. It was unclear whether the neuropathy was associated with
the mutation found.

NR3C1, ARG673TER

In a proband and her mother with PHA1 (177735), Riepe et al. (2006)
found a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 2017 in exon 5 of the NR3C1
gene, resulting in premature termination of the protein at arg673
(R673X). The mutation deleted the ligand-binding domain. While plasma
aldosterone and renin activity were elevated in the mother, she had no
recollection of treatment or hospitalization related to this condition.

NR3C1, SER675TER

In a patient with PHA1 (177735), Riepe et al. (2006) detected a C-to-T
transition at nucleotide 2024 in exon 5 of the NR3C1 gene that caused
termination of the protein at ser675 (S675X). The mutation deleted the
ligand-binding domain.

.0019
PSEUDOHYPOALDOSTERONISM, TYPE I, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
NR3C1, SER181LEU

In 2 sibs with PHA1 (177735) and their father, Riepe et al. (2006)
detected a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 2453 in exon 6 of the NR3C1
gene, resulting in substitution of leu for ser at codon 181 (S181L).
This mutation had been reported by Geller et al. (2006). The S181L
mutant showed no aldosterone binding, transcription activation, or
translocation to the nucleus. Based on in vitro studies Riepe et al.
(2006) hypothesized that substitution of the bulky apolar leucine for
serine-818 displaces beta-sheet-1, which severely disturbs the
interaction of the receptor with its ligand.

.0020
PSEUDOHYPOALDOSTERONISM, TYPE I, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
NR3C1, GLU972GLY

In a patient with PHA1 (177735) and his mother, Riepe et al. (2006)
detected a 2915A-G transition in exon 9 of the NR3C1 gene that resulted
in substitution of gly for glu972 (E972G). The novel E972G mutation
showed a significantly lower ligand-binding affinity and only 9% of
wildtype transcriptional activity caused by major changes in receptor
conformation. The mutation was predicted to open the hydrophobic core of
the protein and displace helix H10, disturbing the interaction of the
receptor with its ligand.

607559	TITLE *607559 MAHOGUNIN, RING FINGER 1; MGRN1
;;MAHOGANOID, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF;;
KIAA0544
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mahogunin (MGRN1) is a C3HC4 RING-containing protein with E3 ubiquitin
ligase activity in vitro.

CLONING

'Mahoganoid' is a mouse coat color mutation whose pigmentary phenotype
and genetic interactions resemble those of 'mahogany,' which results
from mutation in attractin (ATRN; 603130). He et al. (2003) and Phan et
al. (2002) cloned the mouse mahogunin gene, mutant in mahoganoid mice.
Both groups identified the human homolog as KIAA0544 (Nagase et al.,
1998).

GENE STRUCTURE

The human MGRN1 gene contains 17 exons (Phan et al., 2002; He et al.,
2003).

MAPPING

Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the KIAA0544 cDNA, corresponding to the
MGRN1 gene, to chromosome 16 by radiation hybrid analysis. Phan et al.
(2002) and He et al. (2003) mapped the MGRN1 gene to 16p13.3; the mouse
homolog maps to chromosome 16.

GENE FUNCTION

Human and mouse mahogunin share 95% amino acid sequence identity and
exhibit a similar expression pattern across multiple tissues with
particularly high levels in brain (He et al., 2003). The RING domain
functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and autoubiquitination is dependent
on ATP, E1, E2, and an intact mahogunin RING domain, with ladder
formation proportional to the amounts. In addition, mahogunin-induced
autoubiquitination exhibited specificity for E2; it occurred with UBC5,
used frequently in the stress response to unfolded proteins, but not
with UBC3, used frequently in cell cycle transitions.

He et al. (2003) determined that the MGRN1 gene encodes 4 mRNA isoforms
that contain a central C3HC4 RING domain as the only recognizable
protein motif; however, regions flanking the RING domain and the
N-terminal region of the protein are also conserved between vertebrate
and invertebrate genomes.

ANIMAL MODEL

Mahogunin is the protein mutant in 'mahoganoid,' a coat-color mutation
of mice in which pigmentation is very similar to that of 'mahogany.' The
mahogany phenotype is caused by mutation in attractin (ATRN; 603130). He
et al. (2003) found that animals carrying the original allele, md,
synthesize small amounts of yellow pigment on the flank and ventrum and
do not develop spongy degeneration up to 5 months of age. However,
animals carrying the md(nc) allele (originally known as 'nonagouti
curly') develop progressive spongiform changes, first apparent in the
hippocampus CA3 region at 2 months of age and later extending to
multiple regions of the brain. Vacuolation predominates in the gray
matter and is associated with neuronal loss but preservation of tissue
architecture; the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, brainstem,
caudate-putamen, and cerebellum granule layer are the most consistently
affected regions. In md(nc)/md(nc) mice at 10 months of age, some
regions of the deep cortex and lateral thalamus exhibit mild
astrocytosis before the formation of microscopically visible vacuoles.
Northern hybridization to mouse brain mRNA revealed that md/md mice
expressed reduced levels of a normal-sized transcript and transcripts of
aberrant size, consistent with an intracisternal A particle insertion
into intron 11A. For the md(nc) allele, no transcript was detected by
Northern hybridization, and a thymidine-to-adenine mutation was
identified at position 2 of intron 9 of the Mgrn1 gene. Thus, partial
loss of function for this gene causes a reduction of yellow pigment in
the md allele and complete loss of function causes absence of yellow
pigment and neurodegeneration in the md(nc) allele. The brain
degeneration in md(nc) resembles prion-induced spongiform
encephalopathy. However, no accumulation of the protease-resistant PrP
isoform (PrP-Sc) was seen in these animals.

602845	TITLE *602845 KINESIN FAMILY MEMBER 3C; KIF3C
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening a human fetal brain cDNA library with probes based on a
sequence in the expressed sequence tag (EST) database, Telford et al.
(1998) cloned a novel kinesin-related gene. The full-length cDNA
sequence predicted a 793-amino acid polypeptide that was 98% identical
to that of the mouse Kif3c gene. Northern blot analysis revealed that
KIF3C expressed a 5.0-kb mRNA in brain and 3 smaller mRNAs in all tested
tissues.

GENE STRUCTURE

By PCR and DNA sequence analysis of PAC clones, Telford et al. (1998)
found that the human KIF3C gene consists of 8 exons spanning 12 kb.

MAPPING

Telford et al. (1998) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to map the
KIF3C gene to human chromosome 2p23. They used interspecific backcross
analysis to map the gene to mouse chromosome 12.

NOMENCLATURE

Lawrence et al. (2004) presented a standardized kinesin nomenclature
based on 14 family designations. Under this system, KIF3C belongs to the
kinesin-2 family.

;;NEURONAL CDK5 ACTIVATOR; NCK5A;;
CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE 5, REGULATORY PARTNER, 35-KD; p35(NCK5A);;
p35
p25, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are CDC2 (116940)-related kinases that
bind to cyclin to form active holoenzymes that play a pivotal role in
the regulation of the eukaryotic cell cycle. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5
(CDK5; 123831) is found in several tissues in adult mouse, but brain is
the only tissue that shows Cdk5 histone H1 kinase activity, suggesting
that a CDK5 regulatory subunit is responsible for the activation of CDK5
in brain. Lew et al. (1994) determined the protein sequence of bovine
brain p25, a regulatory subunit of Cdk5. Tsai et al. (1994) isolated
p35, a 35-kD protein in rat neuronal cells that acts a regulatory
subunit for Cdk5. They found that p35 is a phosphoprotein and a
potential substrate for the Cdk5 kinase.

By screening a human fetal brain cDNA library with a partial bovine p25
cDNA, Tsai et al. (1994) isolated p35 cDNAs. Sequence analysis of the
predicted 307-amino acid protein revealed that it is nearly identical to
p25. The authors stated that it seems likely that p25 is a proteolytic
fragment of p35. The p35 protein activated CDK5 histone H1 kinase
activity in vitro and in vivo. In situ hybridization indicated that p35
and Cdk5 are expressed in similar patterns in embryonic mouse brains.
Based on the overlapping expression patterns and association of p35 and
CDK5, and the observation that p35 is a potent and specific activator of
CDK5 kinase, Tsai et al. (1994) concluded that p35 is a regulatory
subunit for CDK5. However, p35 appears to be a novel type of regulatory
partner for the CDKs, because its primary structure is only marginally
similar to that of vertebrate cyclins and p35 is expressed at the
highest level in terminally differentiated, rather than proliferating,
cells.

CDK5 is required for proper development of the mammalian central nervous
system. To be activated, CDK5 must associate with its regulatory
subunit, p35. Patrick et al. (1999) showed that p25, a truncated form of
p35, accumulates in neurons in the brains of patients with Alzheimer
disease (104300). This accumulation correlated with an increase in CDK5
kinase activity. Unlike p35, p25 was not readily degraded, and binding
of p25 to CDK5 constitutively activated CDK5, changed its cellular
location, and altered its substrate specificity. In vivo, the p25/CDK5
complex hyperphosphorylated tau (157140), which reduced tau's ability to
associate with microtubules. Moreover, expression of the p25/CDK5
complex in cultured primary neurons induced cytoskeletal disruption,
morphologic degeneration, and apoptosis. Patrick et al. (1999) concluded
that cleavage of p35, followed by accumulation of p25, may be involved
in the pathogenesis of cytoskeletal abnormalities and neuronal death in
neurodegenerative diseases.

Lee et al. (2000) described the mechanism of conversion of p35 to p25.
In cultured primary cortical neurons, excitotoxins, hypoxic stress, and
calcium influx induced the production of p25. In fresh brain lysates,
addition of calcium can stimulate cleavage of p35 to p25. Specific
inhibitors of calpain (see 114220), a calcium-dependent cysteine
protease, effectively inhibit the calcium-induced cleavage of p35. In
vitro, calpain directly cleaves p35 to release a fragment with relative
molecular mass 25,000. The sequence of the calpain cleavage product
corresponds precisely to that of p25. Application of amyloid beta
peptide A-beta(1-42) (see 104760) induced the conversion of p35 to p25
in primary cortical neurons. Furthermore, inhibition of cdk5 or calpain
activity reduced cell death in amyloid beta-treated cortical neurons.
Lee et al. (2000) concluded that cleavage of p35 to p25 by calpain may
be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease.

By inclusion within a mapped clone (GENBANK AC002119), the p35 gene maps
to human chromosome 17 (Rasooly, 1999). Ohshima et al. (1996) mapped the
Cdk5r gene to mouse chromosome 11.

Ohshima et al. (1996) isolated genomic clones and cDNAs encoding Cdk5r,
the mouse p35 homolog. The mouse gene had no introns in the coding
region.

ANIMAL MODEL

Chae et al. (1997) found that mice lacking p35 displayed severe cortical
lamination defects and suffered from sporadic adult lethality and
seizures. Neuronal birth-dating experiments indicated a reversed packing
order of cortical neurons such that earlier-born neurons resided in
superficial layers and later-generated neurons occupied deep layers.
Kwon and Tsai (1998) reported that the migration of the earliest-born
cortical plate neurons is normal in p35 mutant mice, but cortical
neurons subsequently generated remain underneath these neurons. They
suggested that the p35/Cdk5 kinase is required for cortical plate
neurons to migrate past preexisting neurons and take up superficial
positions to constitute the inside-outside layering order of cortical
lamination.

Mice deficient in p35 show abnormal development of the neocortex,
characterized by inverted layering. In p35 null mice, Gupta et al.
(2003) found that the classic modes of radial neuronal migration, somal
translocation and locomotion, were largely replaced by a distinct mode
of migration, called branched migration. Branched migration is cell
autonomous and associated with impaired neuronal-glial interactions. The
authors noted that mice deficient for reelin (600514) and Dab1 (603448),
which also show disrupted cortical layering, do not show branching
morphology, suggesting distinct signaling pathways.

Pareek et al. (2006) found high expression of Cdk5 and p35 in primary
afferent nociceptive C fibers in mouse dorsal root ganglia. Induction of
inflammation in peripheral nerves resulted in increased levels of Cdk5,
p35, and p25. P35-null mice showed delayed responses to painful thermal
stimulation, whereas transgenic mice overexpressing p35 were
hypersensitive to painful stimuli compared to controls. Pareek et al.
(2006) concluded that Cdk/p35 plays a role in primary afferent
nociceptive signaling.

605452	TITLE *605452 ATP-BINDING CASSETTE, SUBFAMILY B, MEMBER 6; ABCB6
;;MITOCHONDRIAL ABC PROTEIN 3; MTABC3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

For background information on the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of
transporter proteins, see ABCA4 (601691). In addition to the 'full' ABC
transporters with 2 transmembrane domains and 2 nucleotide-binding
domains, there are 'half' proteins that contain only 1 of each domain
(e.g., ABCB1, 171050). Full transporters are usually found in the plasma
membrane, whereas half transporters are found in subcellular organelles.
ABCB6 is located in the outer mitochondrial membrane and is required for
mitochondrial porphyrin uptake (Krishnamurthy et al., 2006).

CLONING

By searching an EST database and screening a liver cDNA library,
Mitsuhashi et al. (2000) obtained a cDNA encoding ABCB6, which they
called MTABC3. The predicted 842-amino acid ABCB6 protein, which is 34%
identical to the half transporter ABCB7 (300135), has 8
membrane-spanning regions. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.4-kb
transcript in all tissues tested, with highest expression in heart and
skeletal muscles. Immunoblot, confocal microscopy, and electron
immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated that ABCB6 is expressed as an
80-kD mitochondrial membrane protein. Analysis of mutant yeast
mitochondria suggested that ABCB6 may help maintain respiratory function
and may also transport Fe/S clusters from mitochondria to the cytosol,
thereby helping to prevent iron accumulation and DNA damage in the
organelle.

In zebrafish, Wang et al. (2012) demonstrated expression of abcb6 in the
eye and central nervous system. Using RT-PCR in human cell lines and
tissues, they observed much higher expression of ABCB6 in retinal and
retinal pigment epithelium cells than in other tissues studied.

By immunohistochemical staining of normal human skin, Zhang et al.
(2013) demonstrated that ABCB6 localizes to the epidermis and has
diffuse cytoplasmic distribution. Western blot analysis confirmed
expression of ABCB6 in human keratinocytes (HaCaT cell line) and
melanocytes (A375 cells).

GENE STRUCTURE

Mitsuhashi et al. (2000) determined that the ABCB6 gene spans 11 kb and
contains 19 exons in the protein-coding region.

MAPPING

Using FISH, Mitsuhashi et al. (2000) mapped the ABCB6 gene to 2q36,
close to the locus for lethal neonatal metabolic syndrome (603358), a
disorder of mitochondrial function associated with iron metabolism.

GENE FUNCTION

Transport of porphyrins into isolated mitochondria is energy-dependent,
as expected for the movement of anions into a negatively charged
environment. ATP-binding cassette transporters actively facilitate the
transmembrane movement of substances. Krishnamurthy et al. (2006) found
that the mitochondrial ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCB6 is
upregulated (mRNA and protein in human and mouse cells) by elevation of
cellular porphyrins and postulated that ABCB6 has a function in
porphyrin transport. The authors also predicted that ABCB6 is
functionally linked to heme biosynthesis, because its mRNA is found in
both human bone marrow and CD71+ early erythroid cells (by database
searching), and because ABCB6 is highly expressed in human fetal liver,
and Abcb6 in mouse embryonic liver. Krishnamurthy et al. (2006)
demonstrated that ABCB6 is uniquely located in the outer mitochondrial
membrane and is required for mitochondrial porphyrin uptake. After ABCB6
is upregulated in response to increased intracellular porphyrin,
mitochondrial porphyrin uptake activates de novo porphyrin biosynthesis.
This process was blocked when the Abcb6 gene in mice was silenced.
Krishnamurthy et al. (2006) concluded that their results challenged
previous assumptions about the intracellular movement of porphyrins and
the factors controlling heme biosynthesis.

Helias et al. (2012) identified ABCB6 as the genetic basis of the
Langereis (Lan) blood group antigen (see 111600). ABCB6 was demonstrated
to be present at the plasma membrane of erythrocytes, and the protein
was shown to play a role in export of porphyrin from red blood cells.
The Lan antigen was also present on HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma
cells, but not on several other cancer cell lines.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Lan(-) Blood Group Phenotype

In 12 individuals with the Langereis(-) blood group phenotype (111600),
Helias et al. (2012) identified 10 different truncating mutations in the
ABCB6 gene (see, e.g., 605452.0001-605452.0005). All mutations were
present in the homozygous or compound heterozygous state, indicating
autosomal recessive inheritance of the trait. None of the individuals
had anemia, abnormal erythropoiesis, or signs of porphyria, but some of
the women developed anti-Lan antibodies during pregnancy and/or in
response to transfusion with Lan(+) blood. Helias et al. (2012)
suggested that Lan(-) individuals may have altered pharmacokinetics with
regard to certain drugs potentially transported by ABCB6.

- Isolated Microphthalmia with Coloboma 7

In a 3-generation Chinese family, originally reported by Dong et al.
(2009), with autosomal dominant iris and chorioretinal coloboma (614497)
mapping to chromosome 2q35 and known to be negative for mutation in
coloboma-associated genes, Wang et al. (2012) sequenced the exons of 76
candidate genes and identified a heterozygous missense mutation in the
ABCB6 gene (L811V; 605452.0006) that segregated with the disease.
Subsequent analysis of ABCB6 in 116 sporadic Indian patients with
coloboma who were negative for mutation in 9 known coloboma genes
revealed heterozygosity for a different missense mutation (A57T;
605452.0007) in 3 unrelated patients with microphthalmia and coloboma
(MCOPCB7; 614497).

- Dyschromatosis Universalis Hereditaria 3

In a 5-generation Chinese family segregating autosomal dominant
dyschromatosis universalis hereditaria (DUH3; 615402) mapping to
chromosome 2q33.1-q36.1, Zhang et al. (2013) performed whole-exome and
Sanger sequencing and identified a heterozygous missense mutation in the
ABCB6 gene (L356P; 605452.0008) that segregated with disease in the
family and was not found in 500 geographically matched controls.
Screening of the ABCB6 gene in 6 sporadic DUH patients revealed
heterozygosity for missense mutations (S170G, 605452.0009; G579E,
605452.0010) in 2 patients. Immunofluorescence analysis of transfected
B16 cell lines demonstrated that mutant ABCB6 is retained in the Golgi
apparatus, whereas wildtype protein accumulates in the dendrites.

ANIMAL MODEL

Wang et al. (2012) performed morpholino knockdown of abcb6 in zebrafish
and observed coloboma and retarded development. The phenotypes could be
rescued by wildtype ABCB6 mRNA, but could not be rescued by injection of
human mRNA containing either the L811V (605452.0006) or the A57T
(605452.0007) mutation.

highly conserved residue. The mutation was not found in unaffected
family members or in 500 geographically matched controls.

transition in exon 1 of the ABCB6 gene, resulting in a ser170-to-gly
(S170G) substitution at a highly conserved residue. The mutation was not
found in 400 controls or in the 1000 Genomes Project or UCSC Genome
Browser databases. Immunofluorescence analysis of transfected mouse B16
cell lines demonstrated that the S170G mutant is largely retained in the
Golgi apparatus, whereas wildtype ABCB6 accumulates in the dendrites.

612168	TITLE *612168 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 39 (ZINC TRANSPORTER), MEMBER 3; SLC39A3
;;ZRT- AND IRT-LIKE PROTEIN 3; ZIP3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database searching with the sequences of fungal and plant zinc
transporters, Gaither and Eide (2000) identified 3 human members of the
ZIP superfamily: ZIP1 (SLC39A1; 604740), ZIP2 (SLC39A2; 612166), and
ZIP3 (SLC39A3). The 3 deduced human proteins share greater than 49%
similarity.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SLC39A3
gene to chromosome 19 (TMAP RH81024).

GENE FUNCTION

Desouki et al. (2007) noted that normal human prostate glandular
epithelium has the unique function of accumulating high levels of zinc
and that in prostate cancer this capability is lost as an early event in
the development of the malignant cells. By immunohistochemistry analysis
of human normal and malignant prostate tissue sections, they determined
that, like SLC39A1, both SLC39A2 and SLC39A3 are downregulated in
malignant cells in situ along with the depletion of zinc levels. SLC39A2
and SLC39A3 were localized predominantly at the apical cell membrane,
which is in contrast to the SLC39A1 localization at the basolateral
membrane. Desouki et al. (2007) suggested that SLC39A1 is important for
the extraction of zinc from circulation as the primary source of
cellular zinc, whereas SLC39A2 and SLC39A3 are important for retention
of the zinc in the cellular compartment. They proposed that zinc is a
tumor suppressor agent and that SLC39A1, SLC39A2, and SLC39A3 are tumor
suppressor genes.

609022	TITLE *609022 RAPAMYCIN-INSENSITIVE COMPANION OF MTOR; RICTOR
;;AVO3, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; AVO3;;
KIAA1999
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

RICTOR and MTOR (FRAP1; 601231) are components of a protein complex that
integrates nutrient- and growth factor-derived signals to regulate cell
growth (Sarbassov et al., 2004).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Ohara et al. (2002) cloned KIAA1999. RT-PCR ELISA detected
intermediate and relatively uniform expression in all adult and fetal
tissues and specific brain regions examined.

By sequencing peptides obtained from purified human RICTOR, followed by
database analysis and RT-PCR, Sarbassov et al. (2004) cloned RICTOR
cDNA. The deduced 1,708-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of 192 kD. RICTOR contains evolutionarily conserved sequences,
notably an N-terminal region of about 200 amino acids and several
smaller regions, including a repeated block of 20 amino acids.

Jacinto et al. (2004) cloned mouse Rictor, which they called Avo3. The
deduced protein contains 1,708 amino acids. A 9.5-kb transcript was
detected in all tissues examined, with higher levels in skeletal muscle,
kidney, placenta, and leukocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

Sarbassov et al. (2004) found that there was an inverse correlation
between the relative amounts of RAPTOR (607130) and RICTOR in several
human cell lines. Rapamycin treatment of human embryonic kidney cells
eliminated the binding of MTOR to RAPTOR, but did not affect the
interaction of MTOR with RICTOR. Knockdown of RICTOR caused accumulation
of thick actin fibers throughout much of the cytoplasm in HeLa cells,
loss of actin at the cell cortex, altered distribution of cytoskeletal
proteins, and reduced protein kinase C (PKC)-alpha (see 176960)
activity. Sarbassov et al. (2004) found that the RICTOR-containing MTOR
complex contains LST8 (GBL; 612190) but not RAPTOR. Furthermore, the
RICTOR-MTOR complex did not regulate the MTOR effector S6K1 (608938) and
was not bound by FKBP12 (186945)-rapamycin. Sarbassov et al. (2004)
concluded that the RICTOR-MTOR complex modulates the phosphorylation of
PKC-alpha and the actin cytoskeleton, similar to TOR signaling in yeast.

Jacinto et al. (2004) identified 2 distinct mammalian TOR complexes:
TORC1, which contains TOR, LST8, and RAPTOR, and TORC2, which contains
TOR, LST8, and RICTOR. Like yeast TORC2, mammalian TORC2 was rapamycin
insensitive and functioned upstream of Rho GTPases to regulate the actin
cytoskeleton. TORC2 did not regulate S6K activity. Knockdown of TORC2,
but not TORC1, prevented paxillin (602505) phosphorylation, actin
polymerization, and cell spreading.

Akt/PKB (164730) activation requires the phosphorylation of ser473.
Sarbassov et al. (2005) showed that in Drosophila and in human cells TOR
(FRAP1; 601231) and its associated protein rictor are necessary for
ser473 phosphorylation, and that a reduction in rictor or mTOR
expression inhibited an AKT/PKB effector. The rictor-mTOR complex
directly phosphorylated Akt/PKB on ser473 in vitro and facilitated
thr308 phosphorylation by PDK1 (605213).

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Ohara et al. (2002) mapped the RICTOR gene
to chromosome 5.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yang et al. (2006) found that Rictor knockout in mice was embryonic
lethal. Rictor -/- embryos had no detectable Akt phosphorylation on
ser473 and greatly reduced Akt phosphorylation on thr308. Western blot
analysis showed that phosphorylation of multiple Akt substrates was
decreased in Rictor -/- embryos. Yang et al. (2006) concluded that TORC2
plays a critical role in AKT activation.

By analysis of Rictor-null mouse embryos, Shiota et al. (2006) found
that Rictor was critical for Akt phosphorylation during embryogenesis,
and that it was essential for normal growth and development. Rictor-null
mouse fibroblasts exhibited low proliferation rates, impaired Akt
activity, and diminished metabolic activity.

Lee et al. (2010) found that mice with a conditional deletion of Rictor,
an essential component of TORC2, exhibited impaired differentiation into
Th1 and Th2 cells but retained Th17 cell generation. Immunoblot analysis
of activated Cd4 (1869440)-positive T cells revealed reduced
phosphorylation of Akt and Pkc. In Rictor-deficient cells,
complementation with active Akt restored only Tbet (TBX21; 604895)
expression and Th1 cell differentiation, whereas activated Pkc-theta
(PRKCQ; 600448) reverted only Gata3 (131320) transcription and Th2 cell
defects. Lee et al. (2010) concluded that the dominant function of TORC2
under physiologic conditions in T cells is to guide differentiation
mediated dichotomously by the TORC2 targets AKT and PKC.

605003	TITLE *605003 SENTRIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE FAMILY, MEMBER 6; SENP6
;;SUMO1-SPECIFIC PROTEASE 1; SUSP1; SSP1
SUSP1/TCBA1 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ubiquitin-like molecules (UBLs), such as SUMO1 (UBL1; 601912), are
structurally related to ubiquitin (191339) and can be ligated to target
proteins in a similar manner as ubiquitin. However, covalent attachment
of UBLs does not result in degradation of the modified proteins. SUMO1
modification is implicated in the targeting of RANGAP1 (602362) to the
nuclear pore complex, as well as in stabilization of I-kappa-B-alpha
(NFKBIA; 164008) from degradation by the 26S proteasome. Like ubiquitin,
UBLs are synthesized as precursor proteins, with 1 or more amino acids
following the C-terminal glycine-glycine residues of the mature UBL
protein. Thus, the tail sequences of the UBL precursors need to be
removed by UBL-specific proteases, such as SENP6, prior to their
conjugation to target proteins (Kim et al., 2000). SENPs also display
isopeptidase activity for deconjugation of SUMO-conjugated substrates
(Lima and Reverter, 2008).

CLONING

By screening human brain cDNAs for the potential to encode proteins that
are at least 50 kD, Nagase et al. (1998) isolated a partial SUSP1 cDNA,
which they called KIAA0797, that lacks 5-prime coding sequence. The
deduced partial SUSP1 protein has 1,084 amino acids. RT-PCR followed by
ELISA detected SUSP1 expression in all 10 human tissues examined, with
highest expression in ovary and lowest expression in spleen.

By 5-prime-anchored PCR using the KIAA0797 cDNA isolated by Nagase et
al. (1998), Kim et al. (2000) determined the complete SUSP1 coding
sequence. The deduced 1,112-amino acid SUSP1 protein is a cysteine
protease containing the conserved histidine, aspartic acid, and cysteine
residues of the catalytic triad and the invariant glutamine residue that
helps form the oxyanion hole. The sequence similarity of SUSP1 to other
known UBL-specific proteases was largely restricted to the active site
domains. Recombinant SUSP1 was exclusively localized to the cytoplasm of
mammalian cells. Northern blot analysis detected a 4.4-kb SUSP1
transcript in various human tissues. The highest expression of SUSP1 was
in reproductive organs, namely testis, ovary, and prostate. SUSP1 was
also expressed in colon and peripheral blood leukocytes. Little or no
SUSP1 transcripts were detected in brain, liver, lung, kidney, pancreas,
spleen, thymus, heart, and skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Kim et al. (2000) found that recombinant SUSP1 expressed in bacteria
efficiently released SUMO1 from a SUMO1-beta-galactosidase fusion
protein but not from a RANGAP1-SUMO1 conjugate, suggesting a role for
SUSP1 in the generation of mature SUMO1 specifically from its precursor.
SUSP1 showed a tight substrate specificity for SUMO1. Based on the SUSP1
expression pattern, Kim et al. (2000) suggested that SUSP1 may play a
role in the regulation of SUMO1-mediated cellular processes particularly
related to reproduction.

Lima and Reverter (2008) showed that the isolated catalytic domains of
SENP6 and SENP7 (612846) could not efficiently process SUMO1, SUMO2
(603042), and SUMO3 (602231) precursors. In contrast, SENP6 and SENP7
exhibited efficient SUMO deconjugation activity, with a preference for
substrates containing SUMO2 or SUMO3 over substrates containing SUMO1.
SENP6 and SENP7 showed higher rates for deconjugating di- or poly-SUMO2
and -SUMO3 than for deconjugating SUMO2- or SUMO3-conjugated RANGAP1.
Lima and Reverter (2008) concluded that the high poly-SUMO2 and -SUMO3
chain deconjugation activities of SENP6 and SENP7 may reflect a
preference for flexible isopeptide-linked substrates.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SUSP1
gene to chromosome 6 (TMAP WI-6806). By genomic sequence analysis,
Tagawa et al. (2002) mapped the SUSP1 gene to chromosome 6q13.

CYTOGENETICS

HT-1 is a T-cell lymphoma/leukemia cell line with complex cytogenetic
aberrations. Tagawa et al. (2002) found that del(6)(q13q21) in HT-1
cells resulted in fusion of nucleotide 551 of the SUSP1 gene to exon 4
of the TCBA1 gene (NKAIN2; 609758). Nucleotides 489 to 509 of SUSP1 were
deleted in the chimeric transcript. A frameshift occurred in exon 4 of
TCBA1 in the chimeric transcript, resulting in a chimeric protein with a
unique truncated C terminus relative to wildtype SUSP1.

490000	TITLE *490000 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN, Y-LINKED; ZFY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ZFY gene is actively transcribed in males and appears to be involved
in sperm or testis maturation (summary by Dorit et al., 1996).

CLONING

Page et al. (1987) identified a Y-encoded zinc finger protein,
designated ZFY, which they thought might represent the
testis-determining factor (TDF). They cloned a 230-kb segment of the
human Y chromosome thought to contain some or all of the TDF gene. The
cloned region spanned the deletion in a female who carried all but 160
kb of the Y. Homologous sequences were found within this sex-determining
region of the mouse Y chromosome. The nucleotide sequence of this
conserved DNA on a human Y chromosome suggested that it encodes a
protein with multiple 'finger' domains, as first described in frog
transcription factor IIIA. The encoded protein was thought to bind to
nucleic acids in a sequence-specific manner and to regulate
transcription.

GENE FUNCTION

Using PCR, Palmer et al. (1990) showed close similarity of ZFY and ZFX
(314980). They demonstrated the expression of both genes in a wide range
of adult and fetal human tissues and showed that ZFX is expressed from
an inactive X chromosome present in human-mouse hybrids. Palmer et al.
(1989) presented genetic evidence that ZFY is not the testis-determining
factor (see SRY, 480000): they observed XX males lacking ZFY. In 4 XX
males lacking ZFY, they found an exchange of Y-specific sequences next
to the pseudoautosomal boundary, thereby defining the region in which
TDF must lie.

MAPPING

Muller and Schempp (1989) assigned the ZFY gene to Yp11.32 by in situ
hybridization.

CYTOGENETICS

Models of sex determination must accommodate the finding of a
ZFY-related locus on the X chromosome. The presence of similar sequences
in birds suggested a possible role not only in the XX/XY sex
determination system of mammals, but also in the ZZ/ZW system of birds.
Mapping studies by hybridization to DNA from somatic cell hybrids
containing various fragments of the X chromosome suggested that the
sequence on the X chromosome maps to region Xp22.3-p21. Page et al.
(1987) advanced several hypotheses to explain the existence of the
X-linked locus. One hypothesis was inconsistent with the prevailing
notion of a dominantly acting sex-determining factor unique to the Y
chromosome. This model suggested that the X and Y loci are functionally
interchangeable, that both are testis determining, and that the X locus
is subject to X-chromosome inactivation. According to this model, sex is
determined by the total number of expressed X and Y loci: a single dose
is female-determining, while a double (or greater) dose is
male-determining. The addition of an X-derived transgene to the genome
of an XX embryo should result in testis differentiation, as long as that
transgene is not subject to X inactivation. Increased expression of the
X-chromosomal locus could explain the presence of testicular tissue in
XX hermaphrodites and the rare Y-negative XX males, who lack the TDF
locus of the Y chromosome. Although some XY females lack TDF as judged
by Y-DNA analysis, others do not have discernible deletions. These
unexplained XY females may have point mutations in TDF or in genes that
function in conjunction with or downstream of TDF. The model mentioned
above suggests that mutation in the X-chromosomal locus (at Xp22.3-p21)
could cause XY embryos to develop as females.

EVOLUTION

Sinclair et al. (1988) showed that in marsupials sequences homologous to
ZFY (and ZFX) map not to the X and Y but to autosomes. This implies that
ZFY is not the primary sex-determining gene in marsupials.

Mahaffey et al. (1997) concluded that the human ZFY gene has 2 mouse
homologs, designated Zfy1 and Zfy2, which apparently arose by an
intrachromosomal duplication of an ancestral gene on the Y chromosome.
Zambrowicz et al. (1994) characterized the promoters of the murine Zfy1
and Zfy2 genes.

Dorit et al. (1995) found no polymorphism of the 729-bp intron located
immediately upstream of the ZFY zinc finger exon in a sample of 38
individuals chosen to represent a cross-section of geographic origins.
This was surprising to the authors because interspecific comparisons
with other nonhuman primates revealed phylogenetically informative
sequence changes. The invariance likely resulted from either a recent
selective sweep, a recent origin for modern homo sapiens, recurrent male
population bottlenecks, or historically small affected male population
sizes. Fu and Li (1996) used what they called a more rigorous method and
showed that the most recent common ancestor of present humans may have
been only half as long ago as the estimate made by Dorit et al. (1995):
270,000 years, with 95% confidence limits of 0 to 800,000. Three other
groups (Donnelly et al., 1996; Weiss and von Haeseler, 1996; and Rogers
et al., 1996) also commented on the question of the age of the most
recent common ancestor (MRCA), and Dorit et al. (1996) offered a
response. They commented that, given the small number of changes taking
place along the branches and nodes of this gene tree, their original
data should not be used as a 'molecular clock.'

Genes located on the mammalian Y chromosome outside the pseudoautosomal
region do not recombine with those on the X chromosome and are predicted
to either undergo selection for male function or gradually degenerate
because of an accumulation of deleterious mutations. Slattery et al.
(2000) performed phylogenetic analyses of X-Y homologs Zfx and Zfy among
26 felid species, which indicated 2 ancestral episodes of directed
genetic exchange (ectopic gene conversion) from X to Y: once during the
evolution of the pallas cat and once in a common predecessor of ocelot
lineage species. Replacement of the more rapidly evolving Y homolog with
the evolutionarily constrained X copy may represent a mechanism for
adaptive editing of functional genes on the nonrecombining region of the
mammalian Y chromosome.

604509	TITLE *604509 INTERLEUKIN 18 RECEPTOR ACCESSORY PROTEIN; IL18RAP
;;INTERLEUKIN 18 RECEPTOR, BETA CHAIN; IL18RB;;
ACCESSORY PROTEIN-LIKE; ACPL
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Interleukin-18 (IL18; 600953) binds to IL18R1 (604494), a receptor with
sequence homology to IL1 receptors. Signaling by IL1 (147760, 147720)
through IL1R1 (147810) also requires the presence of the IL1 receptor
accessory protein (IL1RACP; 602626) to increase the affinity of IL1R for
IL1. By searching the EST database for a molecule homologous to IL1RACP,
Born et al. (1998) identified the interleukin-18 receptor accessory
protein (IL18RAP), which they called ACPL (accessory protein-like).
IL18RAP was unable to mediate signaling by IL1 but did play a role in
signaling by IL18. By screening an EL46.1 cDNA library with an IMAGE
clone, Born et al. (1998) obtained the full-length open reading frame
for the 600-amino acid protein. IL18RAP shares 65% amino acid identity
with the homologous mouse protein and 25 to 27% identity with members of
the IL1R family. IL18RAP is predicted to contain a 14-amino acid signal
peptide, a 342-amino acid extracellular (Ig superfamily-like) segment, a
single transmembrane region, and a 222-amino acid cytoplasmic domain
that is 32% identical to IL1R1. Northern blot analysis revealed that
IL18RAP mRNA, present predominantly as a 3.8-kb product, was expressed
strongly in peripheral blood leukocytes, spleen, lung, and, to a lesser
extent, in colon, but not in any other tissue tested.

By Western blot analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, Koskinen
et al. (2009) detected full-length IL18RAP as a band at 70 kD and a
second band at 37 kD, suggesting a putative alternative isoform of
IL18RAP.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Born et al. (1998) mapped the IL18RAP gene
to chromosome 2, near the IL18R1 and IL1R1 loci.

GENE FUNCTION

Born et al. (1998) found that although IL18RAP did not bind IL18 in
vitro, coexpression of IL18R1 and IL18RAP was required for IL18
responsiveness in terms of NF-kappa-B (see 164011) and JNK (see 601158)
activation. Furthermore, a mutant version of IL18RAP lacking the
cytoplasmic domain inhibited IL18 signaling.

IL18RAP gene and susceptibility to celiac disease, see CELIAC8 (612006).

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Le Coniat et al. (1992) cloned a cDNA encoding a nuclear 43-kD
glycoprotein, identified as the G hnRNP protein. They designated the
gene HNRPG. The HNRPG cDNA has 60% homology with RBMY1A1.

Mazeyrat et al. (1999) isolated and sequenced 2 Rbmx mouse cDNA clones,
which they named Rbmx1 and Rbmx2, with distinct 3-prime ends. RT-PCR
showed that both Rbmx transcripts are ubiquitously expressed. Mazeyrat
et al. (1999) concluded that, based on the absence of intronic sequence,
the mouse Hnrpg gene is a retroposon derived from Rbmx.

GENE FUNCTION

The genes on the human Y chromosome fall into 2 classes with distinct
evolutionary origins. Widely expressed, single-copy genes with X
homologs that escape inactivation (X-Y shared genes) derive from the
ancient proto X-Y chromosome pair. Testis-specific, multicopy genes with
no X homologs originate from autosomes and have accumulated on a
'selfish Y' because of their male-specific function. Copies of genes in
the RBMY gene family (see RBMY1A1, 400006) are candidate spermatogenesis
genes because they are found in all 3 azoospermia factor (AZF) deletion
intervals on the human Yq, which are associated with oligospermia or
azoospermia (Vogt et al., 1997). An active X-borne homolog of the
Y-borne RBMY gene was demonstrated in humans and marsupials by Delbridge
et al. (1999) and in the mouse by Mazeyrat et al. (1999). Delbridge et
al. (1999) stated that, like other gene pairs on the X and Y chromosomes
(e.g., DFFRX/DFFRY; see 400005), RBMX retained a widespread function and
RBMY evolved a male-specific function in spermatogenesis. Thus, RBMY1A1,
far from belonging to a 'second class' of testis-specific elements, is a
diverged X-Y shared gene.

Venables et al. (2000) used a yeast 2-hybrid system to show that the
RBMY gene product hnRNPG and a novel testis-specific relative (termed
hnRNPG-T) interact with Tra2-beta (TRA2B; 602719), an activator of
pre-mRNA splicing that is ubiquitous but highly expressed in testis. The
RBMY gene product and Tra2-beta colocalized in 2 major domains in human
spermatocyte nuclei. Incubation with the protein interaction domain of
the RBMY gene product inhibited splicing in vitro of a specific pre-mRNA
substrate containing an essential enhancer bound by Tra2-beta. The
RNA-binding domain of RBM affected 5-prime splice site selection. The
authors concluded that the hnRNPG family of proteins is involved in
pre-mRNA splicing and hypothesized that RBM may be involved in
Tra2-beta-dependent splicing in spermatocytes.

Using in vivo splicing assays, Hofmann and Wirth (2002) identified
hnRNPG and its paralog RBM as splicing factors that promoted the
inclusion of SMN2 (601627) exon 7. Both hnRNPG and RBM nonspecifically
bound RNA, but directly and specifically bound Htra2-beta1, an SR-like
splicing factor which stimulates inclusion of exon 7 through a direct
interaction with SMN2 exon 7 pre-mRNA. Using deletion mutants of hnRNPG,
the authors demonstrated a specific protein-protein interaction of
hnRNPG with Htra2-beta1, which mediated the inclusion of SMN2 exon 7
rather than the nonspecific interaction of hnRNPG with SMN pre-mRNA.
These trans-acting splicing factors were also effective on endogenous
SMN2 transcripts and increased the endogenous SMN protein level. The
authors presented a model of how exon 7 mRNA processing may be regulated
by these splicing factors.

Nasim et al. (2003) showed that HNRNPG and the splicing activator
protein TRA2B have opposite effects upon the incorporation of several
exons, and that both are capable of acting as either an activator or a
repressor. HNRNPG acts via a specific sequence to repress the skeletal
muscle-specific exon (SK) of human slow skeletal alpha-tropomyosin
(TPM3; 191030), and stimulates inclusion of the alternative nonmuscle
exon. The binding of HNRNPG to the exon is antagonized by TRA2B. The 2
proteins also have opposite effects upon a dystrophin (300377)
pseudoexon. This exon was incorporated to a higher level in patient
heart muscle than skeletal muscle, causing X-linked dilated
cardiomyopathy. Cotransfection with HNRNPG repressed incorporation in
cardiac myoblasts, whereas TRA2B increased it in skeletal myoblasts. The
authors proposed that the HNRNPG/TRA2B ratio may contribute to cellular
splicing preferences, and that the higher proportion of HNRNPG in
skeletal muscle may play a role in preventing the incorporation of the
pseudoexon and thus in preventing skeletal muscle dystrophy.

MAPPING

Delbridge et al. (1999) mapped the RBMX gene to human Xq26 by FISH. By
PCR analysis of human/mouse hybrid cell lines, Mazeyrat et al. (1999)
demonstrated mapping of the HNRPG-homologous structural gene to the
human X chromosome. By FISH, they mapped the mouse Rbmx gene to XA3-XA5,
a region sharing homology of synteny with human Xq26. Mazeyrat et al.
(1999) localized the Hnrpg retroposon, which they renamed Rbmxrt, to
mouse chromosome 14.

- PSEUDOGENES

Le Coniat et al. (1992) had mapped the HNRPG gene to chromosome 6p12 by
radioactive in situ hybridization. Delbridge et al. (1999) found that
the HNRPG locus on 6p12 represents a processed pseudogene and considered
it likely that this and other intronless copies with nucleotide homology
to the HNRPG cDNA on chromosomes 1, 4, 9, 11, and the X chromosome were
derived by retrotransposition from RBMY-like sequence on the human X
chromosome. They suggested that the erroneous localization of the HNRPG
cDNA probably occurred because of the preferential hybridization of the
cDNA clone to the processed pseudogene on chromosome 6. Delbridge et al.
(1999) proposed that the HNRPG locus be renamed RBMXP1.

601683	TITLE *601683 COQ7, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; COQ7
;;CLK1, C. ELEGANS, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In the nematode C. elegans, the activity of clk1 controls the rate of
worm development, the pace of behaviors, and the time of death. Ewbank
et al. (1997) identified the C. elegans clk1 gene. They showed that the
predicted 187-amino acid clk1 protein is conserved among eukaryotes,
including humans, and they cloned partial cDNAs representing the human
and mouse homologs. The clk1 protein is structurally similar to the S.
cerevisiae metabolic regulator Cat5 (also called Coq7). These proteins
contain a tandem duplication of a core 82-residue domain.

Asaumi et al. (1999) cloned the mouse homolog of clk1, designated Coq7.
They cloned the human COQ7 cDNA by screening a liver cDNA library with
the mouse cDNA as probe. Human COQ7 encodes a deduced 217-amino acid
protein with a calculated molecular mass of 24.3 kD. The protein shares
85%, 89%, 53%, and 37% sequence identity with orthologs from mouse, rat,
C. elegans, and S. cerevisiae, respectively. COQ7 transfected into COS-7
cells shows a single band of about 25 kD by Western blot analysis.
Northern blot analysis detected expression of a 0.9-kb COQ7 transcript
in heart and skeletal muscle, with barely detectable expression in
brain, placenta, liver, kidney, and pancreas.

Takahashi et al. (2001) cloned Coq7 from a mouse diaphragm cDNA library
and found that the deduced 217-amino acid protein has an N-terminal,
38-residue mitochondria targeting sequence. Immunofluorescence
localization of Coq7 revealed punctate staining in the cytoplasm of
skeletal muscle and heart muscle, in smooth muscle cells surrounding
small blood vessels, and in renal tubule cells. Coq7 transfected into
COS-7 cells gave a punctate staining pattern consistent with
mitochondrial localization, and transfection with Coq7 lacking the
putative mitochondria targeting sequence led to diffuse cytoplasmic
staining.

Vajo et al. (1999) cloned COQ7 from human heart. They found that the
predicted protein contains 179 amino acids, is mostly helical, and
contains an alpha-helical membrane insertion. It has a potential
N-glycosylation site, a phosphorylation site for protein kinase C and
another for casein kinase II, and 3 N-myristoylation sites. Northern
blot analysis detected 3 transcripts; a 1-kb transcript was predominant
in heart, and a 3-kb transcript was predominant in skeletal muscle,
kidney, and pancreas.

GENE FUNCTION

Ewbank et al. (1997) noted that the timing of a wide range of
physiologic processes is deregulated and the life span is extended in C.
elegans clk1 mutants. Mutations in clk1, clk2 (TELO2; 611140), clk3, and
gro1 interact genetically to affect developmental rate and longevity.
They demonstrated that the clk1 gene complemented the clk1 phenotypes
and restored normal longevity. They also showed that clk1 complements
the phenotype of S. cerevisiae Cat5/Coq7 null mutants, demonstrating
that the 2 genes share biochemical function and that clk1 acts at the
level of cellular physiology.

In yeast, Coq7/Cat5 is essential for several metabolic pathways,
including ubiquinone biosynthesis, respiration, and gluconeogenic gene
activation. Jonassen et al. (1998) demonstrated that the Coq7/Cat5 gene
product is a mitochondrial inner membrane protein directly involved in
ubiquinone biosynthesis. They showed that the defect in gluconeogenic
gene activation in coq7/cat5 null mutants is a general consequence of a
defect in respiration. Jonassen et al. (1998) stated that these results
obtained in the yeast model suggest that the effects on development and
life span in C. elegans clk1 mutants may relate to changes in the amount
of ubiquinone, an essential electron transport component and a
lipid-soluble antioxidant.

Guarente (1997) discussed the relevance of the studies in yeast and
nematode to the understanding of human aging.

GENE STRUCTURE

By PCR amplification and Southern blot analysis on human genomic DNA,
Asaumi et al. (1999) determined that the COQ7 gene contains 6 exons and
spans 11 kb. Analysis of the putative promoter region revealed an Alu-J
subfamily consensus sequence, and CAAT box- and TATA box-like sequences.

MAPPING

By PCR analysis of human/rodent somatic cell hybrids and radiation
hybrid analysis, Asaumi et al. (1999) mapped the COQ7 gene to chromosome
16p12.3-p11. By radiation hybrid analysis and FISH, Vajo et al. (1999)
mapped the gene to 16p13.1-p12.

608411	TITLE *608411 EXPORTIN 6; XPO6
;;EXP6;;
KIAA0370
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Exportins, such as XPO6, recruit cargo in the nucleoplasm in the
presence of RAN (601179)-GTP and form ternary export complexes. These
complexes are transported through nuclear pore complexes to the
cytoplasm, where GTP is hydrolyzed and the export complex is
disassembled.

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1997) cloned XPO6, which they designated
KIAA0370. The 3-prime untranslated region contains Alu sequences and
other repetitive elements. RT-PCR detected highest expression of XPO6 in
testis, with lower levels in thymus, prostate, ovary, and placenta.
Little to no expression was detected in the other tissues examined.

By searching for ESTs encoding proteins with putative importin-beta (see
602738)-like RAN-GTP-binding sites, followed by 5-prime RACE and RT-PCR
of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Stuven et al. (2003) cloned XPO6, which
they called EXP6. The deduced protein contains 1,125 amino acids.

GENE FUNCTION

Stuven et al. (2003) demonstrated that recombinant XPO6 bound beta-actin
(102630), profilin-1 (176610), and several other potential cargos in
HeLa cell nuclear extracts only in the presence of RAN-GTP. The
preferred cargo was the profilin-actin complex, since XPO6 showed little
or no binding to either protein in the absence of the other. Analysis of
the weak interaction between XPO6 and isolated actin suggested that XPO6
bound the complex via association with the actin component. Knockdown of
Drosophila Exp6 by RNA interference abolished nuclear exclusion of actin
and resulted in the appearance of nuclear actin paracrystals.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1997) mapped the XPO6 gene
to chromosome 16.

614797	TITLE *614797 PELLINO, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 1; PELI1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Pellino proteins, such as PELI1, are intermediate components in the
innate immune response signaling cascades initiated by Toll-like
receptors (TLRs; see 603030) and IL1R (147810), and interact with the
Drosophila Pelle homolog IRAK1 (300283), TRAF6 (602355), and NFKB (see
164011) (summary by Jensen and Whitehead, 2003).

CLONING

By database searching, Resch et al. (2001) identified mouse and human
homologs of Drosophila Pellino. The PELI1 gene encodes a 418-amino acid
protein in both mice and humans.

GENE FUNCTION

By coprecipitation and Western blot analysis, Jensen and Whitehead
(2003) showed that PELI1 interacts with the proteins TRAF6 and TAK1
(MAP3K7; 602614), both downstream of IRAK1 in the TLR/IL1R cascade, but
not MYD88 (602170), an upstream protein. However, PELI2 (614798) but not
PELI1 promotes the activation of JUN (165160) and ELK1 (311040) through
phosphorylation of JNK (MAPK8; 601158).

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen to identify proteins interacting with
SMAD6 (602931), followed by coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence
analysis, Choi et al. (2006) isolated PELI1. The SMAD6-PELI1 interaction
was enhanced by treatment with TGFB (190180). Mutation analysis
indicated that the N-terminal region of PELI1 is required for
interaction with SMAD6. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that SMAD6
interaction with PELI1 inhibits IL1R and TLR signaling through a complex
of IRAK1, PELI1, and TRAF6. Inhibition of the complex prevents
degradation of the inhibitor IKBA (NFKBIA; 164008) and translocation of
NFKB to the nucleus, thereby preventing the expression of
proinflammatory genes. RNAi-mediated knockdown of SMAD6 reduced the
antiinflammatory activity mediated by TGFB or BMP4 (112262). Choi et al.
(2006) concluded that SMAD6 is a critical mediator of the TGFB-BMP
pathway that controls antiinflammatory activity and negatively regulates
IL1R and TLR signals.

GENE STRUCTURE

Resch et al. (2001) determined that the PELI1 gene consists of 6 exons.

MAPPING

By analysis of YAC contigs, Resch et al. (2001) mapped the PELI1 gene to
chromosome 2p13.3.

601789	TITLE *601789 PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS FACTOR 13; PEX13
;;PEROXIN 13
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The PEX13 gene encodes peroxisome biogenesis factor-13, a peroxisomal
membrane protein that acts as an essential docking factor for the import
of peroxisomal matrix proteins containing the C-terminal peroxisomal
uptake-targeting signal PTS1 (Gould et al., 1996).

CLONING

By studying yeast mutants deficient in import of peroxisomal proteins,
Gould et al. (1996) identified a novel integral peroxisomal membrane
protein in both yeast and humans that binds the PTS1 receptor via a
cytoplasmically oriented SH3 domain. They designated the protein Pex13p
(PEX13).

Elgersma et al. (1996) identified the same protein in S. cerevisiae.

Bjorkman et al. (1998) determined that human PEX13 cDNA encodes a
deduced 403-residue protein product with a calculated molecular mass of
44.3 kD.

By EST database searching, Fransen et al. (1998) identified a second
isoform of PEX13 containing an additional 39 proline-rich amino acids at
the N terminus.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bjorkman et al. (1998) reported that the PEX13 gene spans approximately
11 kb and contains 4 exons, 1 more than previously thought.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Bjorkman et al. (1998) mapped the
PEX13 gene to chromosome 2p15.

GENE FUNCTION

Gould et al. (1996) concluded that PEX13 functions as a docking factor
for the predominantly cytoplasmic PTS1 receptor.

Elgersma et al. (1996) showed that a point mutation in the C-terminal
SH3 domain of the Pex13p protein inactivated the protein but did not
affect its membrane targeting. A 2-hybrid screen with the SH3 domain of
Pex13p identified Pex5p (600414), a receptor for proteins with a PTS1
signal as its ligands. Pex13p SH3 interacted specifically with Pex5p in
vitro. They found that Pex5p was present mainly in the cytosol and only
a small fraction was associated with peroxisomes. Therefore, Elgersma et
al. (1996) proposed that Pex13p is a component of the peroxisomal
protein import machinery onto which the mobile pex5p receptor docks for
the delivery of the selected PTS1 protein. Erdmann and Blobel (1996)
showed that cells deficient in Pex13p are unable to import peroxisomal
matrix proteins containing PTS1 and, surprisingly, also those containing
PTS2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Shimozawa et al. (1999) reported that the complete human cDNA encoding
PEX13 rescued peroxisomal matrix protein import and its assembly in
fibroblasts from peroxisome biogenesis disorder patients of
complementation group H. They detected mutations in the human PEX13 cDNA
in 2 patients of group H (see, e.g., 601789.0001 and 601789.0002).

Liu et al. (1999) characterized the sole representative of
complementation group 13 of the PBDs, a patient with neonatal
adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD; see 614885). The fibroblasts of this patient
(designated PBD222) displayed defects in the import of multiple
peroxisomal matrix proteins. However, residual matrix protein import
could be detected in the cells from the patient, consistent with the
relatively mild phenotype. PEX13 encodes a peroxisomal membrane protein
with a cytoplasmically exposed SH3 domain, and Liu et al. (1999) found
that expression of human PEX13 restored peroxisomal matrix protein
import in cells from patient PBD222. Furthermore, these cells were found
to be homozygous for an I326T mutation (601789.0002), which Shimozawa et
al. (1999) had independently and simultaneously demonstrated.

In 2 unrelated Saudi patients with Zellweger syndrome (PBD11A; 614883),
Al-Dirbashi et al. (2009) identified different homozygous deletions
involving the PEX13 gene (601789.0003, 601789.0004).

ANIMAL MODEL

Maxwell et al. (2003) found that Pex13 null mouse pups exhibited many of
the clinical features of Zellweger syndrome, including intrauterine
growth retardation, severe hypotonia, failure to feed, and neonatal
death. These mice lacked morphologically intact peroxisomes and showed
deficient import of matrix proteins containing either type-1 or type-2
peroxisome targeting signals. Biochemical analysis of tissue and
cultured skin fibroblasts from these animals indicated severe impairment
of peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation and plasmalogen synthesis. The
brains of these mice showed disordered lamination in the cerebral
cortex, consistent with a neuronal migration defect.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 11A (ZELLWEGER)
PEX13, TRP234TER

In a patient with a severe Zellweger syndrome phenotype (PBD11A;
614883), Shimozawa et al. (1999) found homozygosity for a nonsense
mutation, trp234-to-ter (W234X), which resulted in the loss of not only
the SH3 domain but also the putative transmembrane domain of the PEX13
protein.

.0002
PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 11B
PEX13, ILE326THR

In a patient with neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD; see PBD11B,
614885), whose fibroblasts showed the temperature-sensitive phenotype,
Shimozawa et al. (1999) found homozygosity for a missense mutation,
ile326 to thr (I326T), in the SH3 domain of the PEX13 protein.
Expression studies of this mutant PEX13 cDNA in a PEX13-defective CHO
mutant showed I326T to be a temperature-sensitive mutation and thus
suggested that the PEX13 protein with the I326T mutation in the SH3
domain is stable at 30 degrees C but is somewhat unstable at 37 degrees
C.

Liu et al. (1999) independently identified homozygosity for the I326T
mutation in the cells of patient PBD222. This patient was described by
Shimozawa et al. (1998).

.0003
PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 11A (ZELLWEGER)
PEX13, 147-KB DEL

In a Saudi boy, born of consanguineous parents, with Zellweger syndrome
(PBD11A; 614883), Al-Dirbashi et al. (2009) identified a homozygous
147-kb deletion that included the PEX13 gene in addition to 70-kb
upstream and 45.7-kb downstream regions, predicted to disrupt the
hypothetical genes FLJ32312 and KIAA1841. Both deletion breakpoints
occurred within Alu repeats. The patient was admitted to the neonatal
intensive care unit after birth with severe hypotonia. He had a large
anterior fontanel and high forehead. Brain MRI showed polymicrogyria,
lissencephaly, and poor myelination, and EEG showed cortical dysfunction
and seizure activity. He died at 6 weeks of age of cardiopulmonary
arrest. Fibroblast peroxisomes showed a classic 'ghost' appearance due
to abnormal protein import, and complementation studies indicated
complementation group H (group 13). The deletion was predicted to result
in complete loss of PEX13 function.

.0004
PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 11A (ZELLWEGER)
PEX13, 14-BP DEL, EXON 2

In a Saudi boy, born of consanguineous parents, with Zellweger syndrome
(PBD11A; 614883), Al-Dirbashi et al. (2009) identified a homozygous
14-bp deletion in exon 2 of the PEX13 gene, resulting in a frameshift
and premature termination. The patient was admitted to the neonatal
intensive care unit shortly after birth because of severe hypotonia,
where he showed recurrent apnea, seizures, and elevated liver enzymes.
Renal ultrasound showed multiple cysts. He had dysmorphic facies with
anteverted nostrils, a depressed nasal bridge, and a large, triangular
face. At age 6 months, he showed severe failure to thrive, progressive
hepatic dysfunction, and global developmental delay. Fibroblast
peroxisomes showed a classic 'ghost' appearance due to abnormal protein
import, and complementation studies indicated complementation group H
(group 13). The deletion was predicted to result in complete loss of
PEX13 function.

;;CBF;;
NUCLEOLAR COMPLEX-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF;
NOC1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using the CCAAT element of the HSP70 (see HSPA1A; 140550) promoter to
screen a human lung fibroblast cDNA expression library, followed by
screening an osteosarcoma cell line cDNA library, Lum et al. (1990)
cloned CEBPZ, which they called CBF. The deduced 998-amino acid protein
has a calculated molecular mass of 114 kD. CEBPZ has a domain similar to
the sigma homology domain of yeast TFIID (see 313650) that may mediate
protein-protein interactions. CEBPZ also has a consensus nuclear
localization signal and several putative phosphorylation sites. Northern
blot analysis of HeLa cells detected a 3.8-kb CEBPZ transcript. The
endogenous CEBPZ protein in HeLa cells had an apparent molecular mass of
116 kD by SDS-PAGE.

By searching databases for sequences similar to yeast Noc1, Milkereit et
al. (2003) identified human CEBPZ, which they called NOC1. The deduced
998-amino acid protein has a C-terminal NOC domain found in proteins
involved in transport and maturation of ribosomal 60S subunits.

GENE FUNCTION

Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, Lum et al. (1990) showed
that the CCAAT element of the HSP70 promoter interacted directly with
endogenous CEBPZ in HeLa cell nuclear extracts. Supershift assays with
recombinant CEBPZ confirmed the interaction. Cotransfection in COS cells
demonstrated that CEBPZ drove expression of a reporter gene from the
CCAAT element of the HSP70 promoter. CEBPZ did not stimulate
transcription from the CCAAT elements of the alpha-globin (HBA1; 141800)
or RSV promoters.

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the CRBPZ gene to chromosome 2p22.2 based on an
alignment of the CEBPZ sequence (GenBank GENBANK M37197) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

;;A-KINASE ANCHOR PROTEIN, 250-KD; AKAP250;;
GRAVIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

A-kinase anchor proteins (AKAPs; see 602449) direct the activity of
protein kinase A (PKA; see 176911) by tethering the enzyme near its
physiologic substrates.

CLONING

By screening an endothelial cDNA expression library with serum from a
myasthenia gravis (MG; 254200) patient, Gordon et al. (1992) isolated a
partial cDNA encoding a 250-kD cytoplasmic protein, which the authors
termed gravin. They found that gravin is expressed in endothelial cells,
cultured fibroblasts, and osteosarcoma cells, but not in platelets,
leukocytes, or monocytic cell lines. In erythroleukemic cell lines,
gravin is expressed after phorbol ester induction. Indirect
immunofluorescence of permeabilized cells revealed a trabecular network
of gravin staining. Anti-gravin antibodies were present in the sera of
22 of 72 MG patients but were absent in the sera of 50 normal
individuals and present in the sera of only 1 of 72 patients with other
autoimmune diseases.

By screening fetal brain and adult heart cDNA libraries with
radiolabeled regulatory (R) II subunit PKA as a probe, Nauert et al.
(1997) isolated a cDNA fragment that showed sequence similarity to
gravin. Using this fragment to screen a human heart cDNA library, they
determined that gravin is a novel member of the AKAP family (AKAP12).
The AKAP12 protein has 1,780 amino acids and contains an amphipathic
alpha helix, the structure that binds RII, at residues 1540 to 1553.
Binding studies with fragments of gravin confirmed the binding to RII
and also determined that AKAP12 binds to and inhibits protein kinase C
(PKC; see 176960) in a phosphatidylserine-dependent manner.
Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy of permeabilized cells showed
that RII PKA and AKAP12 are colocalized at the cell periphery.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium assigned the
AKAP12 gene to chromosome 6q24-q25 (TMAP stSG30260).

GENE FUNCTION

The blood-brain barrier is essential for maintaining brain homeostasis
and low permeability. Both astrocytes and oxygen tension are believed to
play a role in the development of the blood-brain barrier.

By use of cDNA representational difference analysis to identify
blood-brain barrier maturation factors regulated by oxygen in
astrocytes, Lee et al. (2003) found that expression of the rat gene
SSeCKS (AKAP12), an ortholog of human gravin, was decreased by hypoxia
and upregulated by reoxygenation at the transcriptional level.
SSeCKS-overexpressing astrocytes decreased the expression of vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF; 192240) via reduction of the AP1
transcription factor (165160), and stimulated expression of
angiopoietin-1 (ANGPT1; 601667), an antipermeability factor in
astrocytes, resulting in repression of angiogenesis in vitro and in
vivo. SSeCKS increased the expression of tight junction proteins in
endothelial cells. Lee et al. (2003) concluded that SSeCKS regulates
blood-brain barrier differentiation by modulating both brain
angiogenesis and tight junction formation.

;;BENZODIAZEPINE RECEPTOR, PERIPHERAL; BZRP; PBR;;
BENZODIAZEPINE PERIPHERAL BINDING SITE; PBS; BPBS;;
ISOQUINOLINE CARBOXAMIDE-BINDING PROTEIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TSPO has channel-like properties and is primarily located in the outer
mitochondrial membrane. It is involved in a variety of functions,
including immunologic responses, apoptosis, and steroidogenesis. The
proapoptotic function of TSPO appears to involve modulation of the
mitochondrial transition pore (MPTP), a channel formed by the
voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC; see 604492) and the adenine
nucleotide transporter (ANT; see 103220). In steroidogenesis, TSPO
appears to operate as a translocator to transfer cholesterol into
mitochondria, where it is converted to pregnenolone (review by Veenman
et al., 2007).

CLONING

Benzodiazepines are psychoactive drugs with sedative, anxiolytic, and
anticonvulsant properties. They exert these actions through receptors
located in the central nervous system; however, some benzodiazepines
also interact with a different type of receptor present mainly in the
mitochondrial compartment of peripheral tissues. Riond et al. (1991)
found that the peripheral receptor is similar in rat, Chinese hamster,
and human. Based on these results, they screened a human cDNA library
with oligonucleotide probes derived from the Chinese hamster sequence.
One clone contained a full-length representation of human peripheral
binding site (PBS) mRNA. The amino acid sequence of human benzodiazepine
PBS deduced from the cDNA was 79% identical to that of rat Pbs.

GENE FUNCTION

Chang et al. (1992) found that the benzodiazepine receptor expressed in
COS-1 cells had remarkably different affinities than did the endogenous
human benzodiazepine receptor. They interpreted this finding as
indicating that the host cell and/or posttranslational modification had
important influences on function of the receptor protein.

Shoukrun et al. (2008) found that knockdown of TSPO with antisense TSPO
or small interfering RNA in HT29 human colorectal cancer cells increased
the rate of cell proliferation compared with controls and reduced the
rate of apoptosis. In contrast, pharmacologic activation of TSPO reduced
the tumorigenicity of HT29 xenografts in immunodeficient mice and
increased their rate of survival. Shoukrun et al. (2008) noted that
their results confirmed previous findings in mouse and rat, and they
concluded that TSPO is a proapoptotic factor.

- Reviews

Veenman et al. (2007) reviewed the roles of TSPO in immunologic
responses, apoptosis, and steroidogenesis. They suggested that the
involvement of TSPO in such disparate biologic functions may indicate a
multidimensional role for TSPO in the host-defense response to disease
and injury.

GENE STRUCTURE

Using a cloned human PBR cDNA as probe, Lin et al. (1993) cloned the
gene, which they found covers 13 kb and is divided into 4 exons, with
exon 1 encoding only a short 5-prime untranslated segment.

MAPPING

Using the cDNA of human BZRP as a probe, Riond et al. (1991) localized
the BSRP gene to chromosome 22q13.3 by in situ hybridization. Chang et
al. (1992) mapped the BZRP gene to chromosome 22 by hybridization to DNA
from a somatic cell hybrid mapping panel. With a regional panel for
chromosome 22, they localized the gene within band 22q13.31.

Bucan et al. (1993) mapped the mouse Bzrp gene to chromosome 15.

602949	TITLE *602949 SIN3-ASSOCIATED POLYPEPTIDE, 18-KD; SAP18
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

An important event in gene expression is the modification of histone
proteins. Hyperacetylation of core histones has been correlated with
gene activation, and hypoacetylation with gene repression. SIN3 (see
607776)-mediated repression of transcription involves the modification
of histone polypeptides. Zhang et al. (1997) purified a SIN3-containing
complex from HeLa cells and found that SIN3 was associated with SAP18,
SAP30 (603378), RBBP4 (602923), RBBP7 (300825), and the histone
deacetylases HDAC1 (601241) and HDAC2 (605164). By searching sequence
databases with SAP18 peptide sequences, the authors identified several
human SAP18 expressed sequence tags from which they constructed a
full-length hybrid SAP18 cDNA. The predicted 153-amino acid SAP18
protein is 49% identical to a C. elegans SAP18 homolog. SAP18 has a
molecular mass of 18 kD by SDS-PAGE. SAP18 was expressed in all tissues
analyzed.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhang et al. (1997) demonstrated that SAP18 directly interacts with SIN3
and enhances SIN3-mediated transcriptional repression. They observed
that SAP18 directs the formation of a repressive complex when tethered
to the promoter.

602776	TITLE *602776 REV3, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; REV3L
;;REV3;;
POLYMERASE, DNA, ZETA; POLZ
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

To get a better understanding of mutagenic mechanisms in humans, Gibbs
et al. (1998) cloned and sequenced the human homolog of the
Saccharomyces cerevisiae REV3 gene. The yeast gene encodes the catalytic
subunit of DNA polymerase zeta, a nonessential enzyme that is thought to
carry out translesion replication and is responsible for virtually all
DNA damage-induced mutagenesis and the majority of spontaneous
mutagenesis. The human gene encodes an expected protein of 3,130
residues, about twice the size of the yeast protein, which has 1,504
amino acids. The 2 proteins are 29% identical in an amino-terminal
region of approximately 340 residues, 39% identical in a
carboxy-terminal region of approximately 850 residues, and 29% identical
in a 55-residue region in the middle of the 2 genes. The sequence of the
expected protein strongly predicted that it is the catalytic subunit of
a DNA polymerase of the polymerase-zeta type; the carboxy-terminal
domain possesses, in the right order, the 6 motifs characteristic of
eukaryotic DNA polymerases, most closely resembles yeast polymerase-zeta
among all polymerases in the GenBank database, and is different from the
human alpha (POLA; 312040), delta (POLD1; 174761), and epsilon (POLE;
174762) enzymes.

Xiao et al. (1998) identified human cDNA clones from 3 different
libraries whose deduced amino acid sequences share homology with yeast
REV3. The gene encodes an mRNA of more than 10 kb. Its expression varied
in different tissues and appeared to be elevated in some but not all of
the tumor cell lines examined.

In a study of genes involved in tumor suppression from 6q21, Morelli et
al. (1998) identified the same sequence as that reported by Gibbs et al.
(1998).

GENE FUNCTION

Gibbs et al. (1998) found that human cells expressing high levels of a
REV3 antisense RNA fragment grew normally, but showed little or no
ultraviolet (UV)-induced mutagenesis and were slightly more sensitive to
killing by UV. They concluded that the human gene therefore appears to
carry out a function similar to that of its yeast counterpart.

Murakumo et al. (2001) noted that, in S. cerevisiae, Rev3 is involved
with Rev1 (606134) and Rev7 (MAD2L2; 604094) in the error-prone
translesion synthesis reaction that frequently induces mutations at
damaged DNA lesions. They demonstrated direct interaction between human
REV3 and REV7 and between REV1 and REV7, as well as homodimerization
between REV7 molecules. The interaction between REV3 and REV7 was
mediated by residues 1847 to 1892 of REV3 and by residues 21 to 155 of
REV7. This region of REV7 was also implicated in REV1 binding and in
homodimerization. Murakumo et al. (2001) hypothesized that REV7 may
regulate the enzymatic activities of REV1 and REV3.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Morelli et al. (1998) determined that the
REV3L gene contains 33 exons, 3 of which are noncoding at the 5-prime
end, and spans approximately 200 kb of genomic DNA.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, Xiao et al. (1998) mapped the REV3L gene to
chromosome 1p33-p32. However, Morelli et al. (1998) mapped the REV3L
gene to chromosome 6q21 by genomic sequence analysis.

ANIMAL MODEL

O-Wang et al. (2002) stated that Rev3-deficient mouse embryos die around
midgestation of embryogenesis, which is accompanied by massive apoptosis
of embryonic cells. They found that Rev3 null mouse blastocycts were
unable to survive and grow in culture. Expression of a Rev3 transgene
restored their outgrowth and suppressed the apoptosis in Rev3 null
embryos, but the transgene was unable to rescue embryonic lethality.
Deficiency of p53 (191170) was also unable to rescue embryonic
lethality, suggesting that Rev3 null embryonic death occurs in a
p53-independent pathway.

162641	TITLE *162641 NEUROPEPTIDE Y RECEPTOR Y1; NPY1R
;;NPYR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Neuropeptide Y (NPY; 162640) is one of the most abundant neuropeptides
in the mammalian nervous system and exhibits a diverse range of
important physiologic activities, including effects on psychomotor
activity, food intake, regulation of central endocrine secretion, and
potent vasoactive effects on the cardiovascular system. Two major
subtypes of NPY (Y1 and Y2) have been defined by pharmacologic criteria.
NPY receptors, such as NPY1R, have been identified in a variety of
tissues, including brain, spleen, small intestine, kidney, testis,
placenta, and aortic smooth muscle (Herzog et al., 1992).

CLONING

Herzog et al. (1992) reported cloning of a cDNA encoding a human NPY
receptor which they confirmed to be a member of the G protein-coupled
receptor superfamily.

Larhammar et al. (1992) independently cloned and characterized the
neuropeptide Y receptor.

GENE FUNCTION

Herzog et al. (1992) found that, when expressed in Chinese hamster ovary
(CHO) or human embryonic kidney cells, the NPY receptor exhibited
characteristic ligand specificity. In the kidney cell line, the receptor
was coupled to a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein that mediated the
inhibition of cyclic AMP accumulation. In the CHO cell line, on the
other hand, the receptor was coupled not to inhibition of adenylate
cyclase but rather to the elevation of intracellular calcium. Thus the
second messenger coupling of the NPY receptor was cell type specific,
depending on the specific repertoire of G proteins and effector systems
present in the cell type.

Wild social strains of C. elegans aggregate the presence of specific
sensory cues, but solitary strains do not. Macosko et al. (2009)
identified the RMG inter/motor neuron as the central site of action of
the neuropeptide receptor gene npr-1, which distinguishes solitary
strains (high npr-1 activity) from wild social strains (low npr-1
activity). High RMG activity is essential for all aspects of social
behavior.

GENE STRUCTURE

Herzog et al. (1993) determined the molecular organization and
regulation of the human NPY Y1 receptor gene. In contrast to the
contiguous structure of most G protein-coupled receptor genes, they
found that the NPY Y1 receptor gene has 3 exons. They also identified a
common PstI polymorphism in the first intron of the gene.

MAPPING

By high resolution fluorescence in situ hybridization, Herzog et al.
(1993) localized the NPY1R gene to chromosome 4q31.3-q32.

Herzog et al. (1997) found that the NPY1R and NPY5R (602001) genes are
colocalized on chromosome 4q31-q32. The 2 genes are transcribed in
opposite directions from a common promoter region. One of the
alternately spliced 5-prime exons of the Y1 receptor gene is a part of
the coding sequence of the Y5 receptor. This unusual arrangement
suggested to Herzog et al. (1997) that the 2 genes arose by a gene
duplication event and that they may be coordinately expressed.

By interspecific backcross analysis, Lutz et al. (1997) mapped the Npy1r
and Npy2r genes to conserved linkage groups on mouse chromosomes 8 and
3, respectively, which correspond to the distal region of human
chromosome 4q.

ANIMAL MODEL

Naveilhan et al. (2001) generated mice deficient in NPY1R by targeted
disruption. Npy1r -/- mice developed hyperalgesia to acute thermal,
cutaneous, and visceral chemical pain, and exhibited mechanical
hypersensitivity. Neuropathic pain was increased and the mice showed a
complete absence of the pharmacologic analgesic effects of NPY. In the
periphery, Y1 receptor activation was sufficient and required for
substance P release and the subsequent development of neurogenic
inflammation and plasma leakage. Naveilhan et al. (2001) concluded that
the Y1 receptor is required for central physiologic and pharmacologic
NPY-induced analgesia and that its activation is both sufficient and
required for the release of substance P and initiation of neurogenic
inflammation.

Cavadas et al. (2006) found that Npy caused secretion of catecholamine
in primary cultures of mouse adrenal chromaffin cells and that this
controlled release was abolished in cultures from Npy1r-null mice.
Adrenal catecholamine content and constitutive release of catecholamine
were increased in Npy1r-null mice. Catecholamine plasma concentrations
were higher in resting Npy1r-null mice than in resting wildtype mice.
Analysis of the adrenal glands of both genotypes revealed no differences
in the medulla, cortex, and X zone. The high turnover of adrenal
catecholamine in Npy1r-null mice was explained by enhanced tyrosine
hydroxylase (TH; 191290) activity, although no change in the affinity of
the enzyme was observed. In a human neuroblastoma cell line expressing
NPY1R, NPY markedly inhibited expression of a reporter gene driven by a
rat TH promoter sequence, suggesting molecular interaction between NPY1R
and TH. Cavadas et al. (2006) concluded that NPY controls the release
and synthesis of catecholamine from the adrenal medulla and consequently
contributes to sympathoadrenal tone.

306250	TITLE *306250 COLONY-STIMULATING FACTOR 2 RECEPTOR, ALPHA; CSF2RA
;;GRANULOCYTE-MACROPHAGE COLONY-STIMULATING FACTOR RECEPTOR, LOW AFFINITY,
ALPHA SUBUNIT; GMCSFR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF, or CSF2;
138960) activates STAT5 (601511) and other signaling pathways via
binding to a cell surface receptor composed of a ligand-binding alpha
subunit, encoded by CSF2RA, and a nonbinding affinity-enhancing beta
subunit, encoded by CSF2RB (138981) (Suzuki et al., 2008).

CLONING

Using an expression cloning strategy, Gearing et al. (1989) isolated a
cDNA encoding CSF2RA, which they called GMCSFR, from a human placenta
cDNA library. The deduced 400-amino acid precursor protein has a
22-amino acid signal peptide. The 378-amino acid mature protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 43.7 kD and contains a single transmembrane
domain, a glycosylated extracellular domain, and a short
intracytoplasmic tail. Northern blot analysis detected GMCSFR expression
in a variety of hemopoietic cells displaying GMCSF binding.

Raines et al. (1991) identified a truncated, soluble form of the
low-affinity GMCSF receptor in choriocarcinoma cells. Clones encoding
the soluble receptor were identical in sequence to the membrane-bound
form except for a 97-nucleotide deletion. The amino acid sequence of
this deleted cDNA predicted a protein that lacks the 84 C-terminal amino
acids of the membrane-bound receptor, including the transmembrane and
cytoplasmic domains, and contains 16 different amino acids at its C
terminus. RNase protection analysis indicated that this variant cDNA was
derived from a naturally occurring mRNA. Soluble receptors had been
identified for several other hematopoietin receptors and may be a
general feature of this class. It is likely that alternative mRNA
splicing is the mechanism by which the soluble counterparts are
generated.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rappold et al. (1992) found that the CSF2RA gene spans at least 45 kb.

MAPPING

By Southern blot analysis of a panel of mouse-human somatic cell
hybrids, Gough et al. (1990) demonstrated that the CSF2R gene is on the
X chromosome. The possibility that an allele also maps to the Y
chromosome was suggested by the observation that many DNA samples from
normal males carry 2 alleles of this gene. Among 65 normal persons, 23
females and 20 males were homozygous for an allele of fragment A,
whereas 8 females and 14 males were heterozygous. By in situ
hybridization, Gough et al. (1990) showed that the CSF2R gene maps to
the tip of the short arm of the X chromosome and the short arm of the Y
chromosome (see 425000), with the most likely localization being
Xpter-p21 and Ypter-p11.2. Although this information was consistent with
its location in the pseudoautosomal region (PAR), conclusive proof
required study of segregation of the locus with respect to sexual
phenotype. They found in a total of 14 informative male meioses, 3
recombination events; i.e., in 2 cases a daughter had inherited the
allele from the paternal Y chromosome, and in 1 instance a son had
inherited the allele from the paternal X chromosome. Thus, the CSF2R
locus is distal to the MIC2 locus (313470), which shows only about 2.5%
recombination and maps close to the PAR boundary. This was the first
localization of a gene of known function to this region, which
encompasses about 2,500 kb.

By pulsed field gel electrophoresis, Rappold et al. (1992) localized the
CSF2RA gene 1,180 to 1,300 kb from the telomere, in close proximity to
the CpG island B5. The gene showed abundant hypervariable sequences, and
a number of informative restriction fragment length polymorphisms were
defined. Rappold et al. (1992) suggested that these polymorphisms might
be useful in proving the pseudoautosomal inheritance of apparently
autosomal traits, as has been suggested for schizophrenia (Crow, 1988),
cerebral dominance (Crow, 1989), and Kabuki make-up syndrome (Niikawa et
al., 1988; 147920), among others.

Rappold (1993) discussed in detail the pseudoautosomal regions that
exist at the tips of the short and long arms of the X and Y chromosomes
and cover 2.6 and 0.4 Mb, respectively.

By both in situ hybridization and linkage analysis, Disteche et al.
(1992) found that the murine Csf2ra gene maps to chromosome 19.

GENE FUNCTION

DiPersio et al. (1988) studied the binding of GMCSF, over a wide range
of concentrations, to normal human peripheral blood cells, bone marrow,
acute and chronic myeloid leukemia cells, and a number of established
human myeloid and nonmyeloid cell lines; thereby, they defined the
receptors.

Gearing et al. (1989) found that transfection of GMCSFR cDNA into COS
cells directed expression of a GMCSF receptor showing a single class of
affinity and specificity for human GMCSF, but not interleukin-3 (IL3;
147740).

Hayashida et al. (1990) showed that the high-affinity GMCSF receptor is
composed of at least 2 components in a manner analogous to the IL2
receptor (see 147730). They proposed to designate the low-affinity GMCSF
receptor as the alpha subunit, and the 'new' protein that they
identified and called KH97 as the beta subunit (see 138981). The 2
subunits are approximately 80 and 120 kD, respectively.

Raines et al. (1991) found that expression of the variant cDNA encoding
the truncated, soluble CSF2R isoform produced a secreted protein that
retained its capacity to bind CSF2 in solution.

Kondo et al. (2000) showed that a clonogenic common lymphoid progenitor,
a bone marrow-resident cell that gives rise exclusively to lymphocytes
(T, B, and natural killer cells), can be redirected to the myeloid
lineage by stimulation through exogenously expressed interleukin-2
receptor (146710) and GMCSF receptor. Analysis of mutants of the
beta-chain of the IL2 receptor revealed that the granulocyte and
monocyte differentiation signals are triggered by different cytoplasmic
domains, showing that the signaling pathways responsible for these
unique developmental outcomes are separable. Finally, Kondo et al.
(2000) showed that the endogenous myelomonocytic cytokine receptors for
GMCSF and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF1R; 164770) are
expressed at low to moderate levels on the more primitive hematopoietic
stem cells, are absent on common lymphoid progenitors, and are
upregulated after myeloid lineage induction by IL2 (147680). Kondo et
al. (2000) concluded that cytokine signaling can regulate cell fate
decisions and proposed that a critical step in lymphoid commitment is
downregulation of cytokine receptors that drive myeloid cell
development.

Loss of either the X or the Y chromosome is apparent in 25% of acute
myeloid leukemias of the M2 subtype (AML-M2), compared with only 1 to 6%
in other AML subtypes, suggesting the involvement of a 'recessive
oncogene' in the genesis of M2 AMLs. The presumed gene is likely to be
in the PAR, because if it were located in the portion of the X
chromosome not shared with the Y, then similar loss of the Y chromosome
would not be predicted, and vice versa. Gough et al. (1990) suggested
that CSF2R may be the gene in question. Loss or inactivation of both
copies of the gene in a myeloid progenitor cell would be expected to
result in a clone of cells unable to respond to GMCSF, and hence in the
relatively undifferentiated phenotype of the M2 form of leukemia.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare lung disorder in which
surfactant-derived lipoproteins accumulate excessively within pulmonary
alveoli, causing severe respiratory distress. It is a disorder of
surfactant metabolism. The importance of CSF2 in the pathogenesis of PAP
has been confirmed in humans and mice, wherein CSF2 signaling is
required for pulmonary alveolar macrophage catabolism of surfactant.
Using flow cytometry, Martinez-Moczygemba et al. (2008) found that
CSF2RA was absent on monocytes from a 4-year-old girl with PAP due to
pulmonary surfactant metabolism dysfunction (SMDP4; 300770). The
patient's mother expressed CSF2RA on all monocytes, whereas the
patient's father and sister expressed CSF2RA only on a subpopulation of
monocytes. Stimulation of granulocytes with CSF2 induced upregulation of
CD11B (ITGAM; 120980) in the mother, but not the patient. Karyotypic
analysis showed that the patient had 1 X chromosome of apparently normal
length and 1 X chromosome with a truncated Xp arm that did not hybridize
with a PAR1 probe. RT-PCR analysis detected expression of CSF2RA in
leukocytes from the patient's family members, but not in those from the
patient. PCR analysis of the 11 coding exons of the CSF2RA gene revealed
a deletion of exons 5 through 13 (306250.0001) in the patient's DNA,
providing a genetic basis for the absence of CSF2RA mRNA and protein.

Using flow cytometry, Suzuki et al. (2008) found that both CSF2RA and
CSF2RB were present on leukocytes from 2 sisters with PAP, as well as
all family members tested. However, Western blot analysis showed that
the affected sisters expressed only a truncated form of CSF2RA, whereas
their father was heterozygous for the normal and truncated forms, and
their mother expressed only normal CSF2RA. CSF2 binding and
CSF2-dependent signaling were severely reduced, but not abolished, in
the sisters, and their CD11B stimulation test was abnormal. Suzuki et
al. (2008) identified a mutation in the CSF2RA gene in the affected
sisters that resulted in a gly174-to-arg (G174R; 306250.0002)
substitution. The father was heterozygous for the G174R mutation, but
the mother had only wildtype CSF2RA. PCR analysis showed that CSF2RA
copy number was reduced in the sisters and their mother, but not in the
father. FISH analysis demonstrated a 1.6-Mb deletion of PAR1, including
the CSF2RA gene, in 1 X chromosome of the sisters and mother. Suzuki et
al. (2008) concluded that PAP may be caused by compound heterozygous
abnormalities affecting the CSF2RA gene, and that CSF2 signaling is
critical for surfactant homeostasis in humans.

ANIMAL MODEL

Schweizerhof et al. (2009) presented evidence that GCSF (CSF3; 138970)
and GMCSF mediate bone cancer pain and tumor-nerve interactions.
Increased levels of both factors were detected in bone marrow lysates
and adjoining connective tissue in a mouse sarcoma model of bone
tumor-induced pain compared to controls. The functional receptors GCSFR
(CSF3R; 138971) and GMCSFR were expressed on peripheral nerves in the
bone matrix and in dorsal root ganglia. GMCSF sensitized nerves to
mechanical stimuli in vitro and in vivo, potentiated CGRP (114130)
release, and caused sprouting of sensory nerve endings in the skin. RNA
interference of GCSF and GMCSF signaling in the mouse sarcoma model led
to reduced tumor growth and nerve remodeling, and abrogated bone cancer
pain.

In a 4-year-old girl with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (300770),
Martinez-Moczygemba et al. (2008) identified a deletion of exons 5
through 13 in the CSF2RA gene. Karyotypic analysis showed that the
patient's other X chromosome had a truncated Xp arm that did not
hybridize with a probe for pseudoautosomal region-1, which contains
CSF2RA. The patient's mother expressed CSF2RA on all monocytes, whereas
the patient's father and sister expressed CSF2RA only on a subpopulation
of monocytes. Stimulation of granulocytes with CSF2 (1389060) induced
upregulation of CD11B (ITGAM; 120980) in the mother, but not the
patient. RT-PCR analysis detected expression of CSF2RA in leukocytes
from the patient's family members, but not in those from the patient.

CSF2RA, GLY174ARG

Suzuki et al. (2008) identified a G-to-A transition in exon 7 of the
CSF2RA gene in genomic DNA from 2 sisters with pulmonary alveolar
proteinosis (300770), one 6 years of age and the other 8 years of age.
The mutation resulted in a gly174-to-arg (G174R) substitution that
altered 1 of 11 potential N-glycosylation sites in the CSF2RA protein.
Western blot analysis showed that the affected sisters expressed only a
truncated form of CSF2RA, whereas their father was heterozygous for the
normal and truncated forms, and their mother expressed only normal
CSF2RA. CSF2 (138960) binding and CSF2-dependent signaling were severely
reduced, but not abolished, in the sisters, and their CD11B (120980)
stimulation test was abnormal. The father was heterozygous for the G174R
mutation, but the mother had only wildtype CSF2RA. PCR analysis showed
that CSF2RA copy number was reduced in the sisters and their mother, but
not in the father. FISH analysis demonstrated a 1.6-Mb deletion of
pseudoautosomal region-1, including the CSF2RA gene, in 1 X chromosome
of the sisters and mother. Transfection of CSF2RA with the G174R
mutation into 293 cells reproduced the CSF2 signaling defect at
physiologic CSF2 concentrations. At high CSF2 concentrations, similar to
those observed in the index patient, signaling was partially rescued,
thereby providing a molecular explanation for the slow disease
progression in the 2 sisters.

;;ISLET-SPECIFIC GLUCOSE-6-PHOSPHATASE CATALYTIC SUBUNIT-RELATED PROTEIN;
IGRP;;
ISLET-SPECIFIC G6CP-RELATED PROTEIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Arden et al. (1999) cloned 2 splice variants of mouse Igrp. The longer
cDNA, which includes exon 4, encodes a 355-amino acid protein with a
calculated molecular mass of about 40.7 kD. This variant shares about
50% amino acid identity with the glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit
(G6PC; 613742) from several species, including human, and has a similar
transmembrane topology, conservation of catalytically important
residues, and an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal. The
shorter transcript, which lacks exon 4, encodes 2 putative proteins,
neither of which are likely to be catalytically active. Northern blot
analysis detected expression in mouse pancreatic islets, and expression
was higher in pancreatic beta-cell lines than in pancreatic alpha-cell
lines. No expression was detected in non-islet neuroendocrine tissue or
in any other tissue tested.

By RT-PCR of cadaveric pancreatic islet total RNA, Martin et al. (2001)
cloned IGRP. The deduced 355-amino acid protein contains 9 major
hydrophobic stretches, 8 of which may span the membrane as an alpha
helix, and a C-terminal ER membrane retention motif. It also has 3
potential N-glycosylation sites, 1 of which, located in the putative
second luminal domain, is conserved with mouse Igrp. Human and mouse
IGRP share about 85% amino acid identity. Northern blot analysis
detected a 3.1-kb transcript in pancreas and weaker expression of 2.4-
and 1.0-kb transcripts in testis. Northern blot analysis detected Igrp
expression in mouse islets, but not in rat islets. RT-PCR analysis of
human islets and beta cell-derived cell lines revealed several splice
variants, the most prominent of which had a deletion of exon 4. Western
blot analysis of human islets showed a protein of about 38 kD. In vitro
translation from 2 alternate start codons, which predict proteins of
40.6 and 33.8 kD, resulted in proteins with apparent molecular masses of
about 37 and 28 kD, respectively.

IGRP was identified as the antigen that serves as the major target of
cell-mediated autoimmunity in diabetes by DiLorenzo et al. (1998). The
IGRP protein was first identified from a subtractive hybridization
screen that was performed to identify beta cell-specific proteins that
could be potential diabetes autoantigens or regulators of insulin
stimulus-secretion coupling (Neophytou et al., 1996). IGRP was initially
investigated as a possible islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase)
that had long been postulated as a key component of a glucose substrate
cycle and control of energy metabolism in the beta cell (Arden et al.,
1999).

GENE FUNCTION

IGRP has 50% sequence identity with liver G6Pase (G6PC; 613742), spans
the membrane in the same way, and has the conserved acid phosphatase
signature but no discernable catalytic activity (Ebert et al., 1999).
Similar to insulin and islet amyloid polypeptide (147940), it is
expressed in a highly pancreatic beta-cell manner, yet seems to be
controlled by a different set of transcription factors. IGRP and mRNA
are abundant in mouse and human islets but are not expressed in the rat,
where the single-copy gene has an altered transcriptional start site and
a series of frameshift mutations and deletions relative to the human and
mouse genes (Martin et al., 2001).

GENE STRUCTURE

Martin et al. (2001) determined that the human, mouse, and rat IGRP
genes contain 5 exons. The promoter regions from all 3 species contain
an HNF3 (see 602294)-binding site and 2 E boxes. The human and mouse
genes, but not the rat gene, also have a TATA box.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis and radiation hybrid analysis, Martin et
al. (2001) mapped the IGRP gene to chromosome 2q28-q32; however, as
there is no band 2q28, the presumed location is 2q24-q32. It is located
adjacent to the myosin heavy chain 1B gene.

Pociot and McDermott (2002) noted that the human IGRP gene maps to a
diabetes susceptibility locus on 2q31 (IDDM7; 600321). Hutton and
Eisenbarth (2003) noted that the IGRP gene resides a short distance from
GAD1 (605363) and Bardet-Biedl syndrome 5 (603650) at 2q31; from the
NEUROD1 gene (601724), which is involved in NIDDM (125853) at 2q32; and
from CTLA4 (123890), which is a candidate gene for IDDM12 (601388) at
2q33. Glucagon (138030) also maps nearby (2q32-q37).

Using interspecific backcross analysis, Ebert et al. (1999) mapped the
mouse Igrp gene to the proximal portion of chromosome 2.

ANIMAL MODEL

The nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse is a widely studied model of human
type I diabetes (IDDM; 222100), an autoimmune disease characterized by
inflammation of pancreatic islets (insulitis) followed by T
cell-mediated destruction of insulin (176730)-producing beta cells. Both
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are required for this pathogenic process; however,
CD8+ T cells appear to be responsible for the initial beta cell insult.
Lieberman et al. (2003) demonstrated that the autoantigen targeted by a
prevalent population of pathogenic CD8+ T cells in NOD mice is IGRP.
Using tetramer technology, IGRP-reactive T cells were readily detected
in islets and peripheral blood directly ex vivo.

604460	TITLE *604460 FAS-ASSOCIATED FACTOR 1; FAF1
;;HFAF1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Interaction of Fas ligand (TNFSF6; 134638) with the FAS antigen
(TNFRSF6; 134637) mediates programmed cell death, also called apoptosis,
in a number of organ systems, notably the immune and nervous systems.
Although these molecules are in the same family as TNF-alpha (191160)
and TNFR (191190), the latter function to activate not only apoptosis
but also NFKB1 (164011), a key transcription factor in chronic
inflammatory diseases. By screening tumor-related proteins derived from
a HeLa cDNA library in a yeast 2-hybrid assay, Ryu et al. (1999)
isolated a truncated version of FAS-associated factor-1 (FAF1), which
can enhance but not initiate apoptosis. Using PCR as well as sequence
information from an EST database to screen HeLa as well as brain and
kidney cDNA libraries, they derived a product corresponding to the
expected size of the complete coding region of 1,970 bp. The deduced
amino acid sequence was 96% and 85% homologous to mouse and quail Faf1,
respectively. Northern blot analysis revealed a single FAF1 mRNA
transcript of 2.8 kb to be most abundant in testis, slightly less
abundant in skeletal muscle and heart, followed by prostate, thymus,
ovary, small intestine, and colon. Expression was detected in all other
tissues tested with the exception of peripheral blood leukocytes. By
immunoblotting with a mouse polyclonal antibody to FAF1, a 74-kD protein
was detected in 6 of 8 tumor cell lines. A 40-kD protein was detected in
1 of the 2 remaining cell lines. Interaction of FAF1 and FAS was shown
in both the yeast 2-hybrid and the GST pull-down assay systems. The
N-terminal 201 amino acids of FAF1, containing a ubiquitin homology
domain, bound to the FAS death domain but not to a death domain mutant
in the yeast 2-hybrid system.

Using whole-mount in-situ hybridization in zebrafish embryos,
Ghassibe-Sabbagh et al. (2011) detected faf1 transcripts at 24 and 30
hours postfertilization (hpf) in the pharyngeal arch primordia. At 56
hpf, when the pharyngeal cartilages were forming, faf1 was strongly
expressed in all arches, with the most prominent expression in the first
(mandibular) and second (hyoid) arch. Knockdown of zebrafish faf1 led to
pharyngeal cartilage defects and jaw abnormalities as a result of a
failure of the cranial neural crest to differentiate and to express
cartilage-specific markers, such as sox9a (see 608160) and col2a1 (see
120140). Administration of faf1 mRNA rescued the phenotype.

MAPPING

Gross (2011) mapped the FAF1 gene to chromosome 1p32.3 based on an
alignment of the FAF1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF136173) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

609590	TITLE *609590 QUAKING, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; QKI
;;QK1;;
QK
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

QKI belongs to a family of RNA-binding proteins that have an HNRNPK
(600712) homology (KH) domain embedded in a 200-amino acid region called
the GSG domain. Other members of this family include SAM68 (KHDRBS1;
602489) and SF1 (601516) (Chen and Richard, 1998). QKI proteins regulate
RNA splicing, export of target RNAs from the nucleus, translation of
proteins, and RNA stability (Lauriat et al., 2008).

CLONING

Ebersole et al. (1996) identified several splice variants of mouse Qki
that could be grouped into 2 classes based on size. The longer mRNAs (7,
6, and 5 kb) were abundant in mouse brain, whereas the shorter mRNAs
(1.5 to 1.9 kb) were less abundant. The longer variants encode deduced
proteins containing an N-terminal proline-rich domain, followed by 2 RG
boxes, a second proline-rich region, a central GSG/STAR domain, a third
proline-rich domain, and 5 tyrosines preceding alternative C-terminal
ends. The GSG domain consists of a KH domain flanked by evolutionarily
conserved quaking (QUA) domains 1 and 2. Qki also has 7 SH3-binding
sites dispersed throughout its sequence. Qki expression peaked in
16-day-old myelinating mouse brain. A splice variant was also detected
in newborn testis. In situ hybridization of normal mouse brain showed
Qki transcripts in myelinating tracts in the cerebellum. Ebersole et al.
(1996) identified multiple QKI transcripts in human, rodent, chicken,
and frog.

By Northern blot analysis, Hardy et al. (1996) found that the 5-, 6-,
and 7-kb Qki mRNAs, which they designated Qki-5, Qki-6, and Qki-7,
respectively, were variably expressed in developing and adult mouse
brain. Levels of Qki-5 declined dramatically after the second postnatal
week, whereas levels of Qki-6 and Qki-7 declined modestly thereafter.
Immunohistochemical analysis detected all 3 proteins in myelinating
cells of the central and peripheral nervous system and in astrocytes.
The isoforms showed distinct intracellular distributions, however, with
Qki-6 and Qki-7 localized to perikaryal cytoplasm and Qki-5 restricted
to nucleus.

Noveroske et al. (2002) found that Qki was expressed in the yolk sac
endoderm in mice, adjacent to developing blood islands.

Using quantitative RT-PCR, Lauriat et al. (2008) found that QKI-5 showed
no significant differences in expression across various age groups in
human prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus. However, QKI-5 was the
only QKI variant expressed at high levels in fetal PFC. QKI-6 expression
increased in PFC in a linear fashion with age, with a substantial
increase between 1 to 2 months and 1 to 2 years of age. In human
hippocampus, QKI-6 expression increased at 1 to 2 years of age, remained
high during childhood, and decreased in adulthood. QKI-7a generally
showed a linear trend toward increased expression in PFC with age, but
there was a peak at 1 to 2 years of age. QKI-7b expression in PFC did
not vary significantly with age due to greater variability between
individuals, but there was a trend toward an increase with age. In
hippocampus, QKI-7a and QKI-7b showed a trend toward decreased
expression in adulthood, similar to QKI-6, but there was greater
variability between individuals. Lauriat et al. (2008) noted that
expression of QKI-6 and QKI-7 in PFC increased during the period of
active myelination.

By sequencing mRNAs expressed in primary cultures of human astrocytes,
Radomska et al. (2013) identified QKI5, QKI6, QKI7, QKI7b, and a novel
variant that they called QKI6b. QKI6b differs from other QKI variants in
the 3-prime UTR and encodes a protein identical to that encoded by QKI6.
QKI6 and QKI6b were the most abundant QKI transcripts detected in human
astrocytes, and QKI5 was the least abundant. Immunohistochemical
analysis with isoform-specific antibodies revealed that QKI6 and QKI7
were uniformly distributed throughout the nucleus, cell body, and
processes, whereas QKI5 localized to nuclei and was excluded from
nucleoli. Western blot analysis detected QKI6 at an apparent molecular
mass of 38 kD. Both QKI5 and QKI7 had apparent molecular masses of about
40 kD.

GENE STRUCTURE

Backx et al. (2010) noted that the QKI gene contains 8 exons.

MAPPING

Backx et al. (2010) stated that the QKI gene maps to chromosome 6q26.

The mouse Qki gene maps to chromosome 17 (Ebersole et al., 1996).

GENE FUNCTION

Chen and Richard (1998) showed that the mouse Qk1 proteins homodimerized
in vivo, and they determined that the GSG domain mediated dimerization
and RNA binding. Self-association was mediated by a region of QUA1
predicted to form coiled coils.

Larocque et al. (2002) found that mouse Qk1 proteins bound a short
element in the 3-prime UTR of Mbp (159430). The balance between the
nuclear and cytoplasmic isoforms of Qk1 controlled the nuclear export of
Mbp mRNAs and the cellular localization of the 17- and 21.5-kD Mbp
isoforms. Overexpression of Qki-5 in cultured rodent oligodendrocytes
recreated the Mbp defects observed in qk(v) mice, with retention of Mbp
in the nucleus. Larocque et al. (2002) concluded that the QKI proteins
have a role in myelination.

In an mRNA analysis of 55 control human brains, Aberg et al. (2006)
found that QKI mRNA levels accounted for 47% of the coordinated
variation of mRNA levels of 6 oligodendrocyte-related genes, PLP1
(300401), MAG (159460), MBP, TF (190000), SOX10 (602229), and CDKN1B
(600778). In silico analysis identified potential QKI-binding sites in
all of the genes except TF. Variation in the relative expression of
splice variant QKI-7 explained a large fraction of additional mRNA
variation in 3 highly coexpressed genes, MAG, PLP1, and TF. Analysis of
55 brains from patients with schizophrenia (see 181500) showed
significantly decreased expression of MAG, PLP1, and TF compared to
control brains that was associated with decreased levels of QKI-7. Aberg
et al. (2006) concluded that QKI is a regulator of oligodendrocyte
differentiation and maturation in the human brain, and suggested that
splice variants of QKI may play a role in myelin and oligodendrocyte
dysfunction in schizophrenia.

Using yeast 2-hybrid screens, coaffinity purification analysis of
transfected HEK293 cells, and bioinformatic analysis, Lim et al. (2006)
developed an interaction network for 54 human proteins involved in 23
inherited ataxias. By database analysis, they expanded the core network
to include more distantly related interacting proteins that could
function as genetic modifiers. RBPMS (601558) was a main hub in the
network and interacted with many proteins, including the cerebellar
ataxia-associated proteins ATN1 (607462) and QK1.

Using a rat cell line and primary mixed glial cultures from neonatal rat
brain, Chen et al. (2007) showed that Qk1 was necessary and sufficient
for oligodendroglia progenitor cell differentiation. Qk1 isoforms 5, 6,
and 7 differed in their ability to promote oligodendroglia
differentiation, which was dependent on the RNA-binding ability of Qk1.
RNA interference-mediated Qk1 knockdown abrogated differentiation
without affecting proliferation capacity or cell cycle progression.

Using qualitative RT-PCR, Lauriat et al. (2008) examined expression of
putative QKI target mRNAs, including MAGI1 (602625), BCAS1 (602968),
CDKN1B, PLP1, and MAG, in human prefrontal cortex and hippocampus from
fetus to adulthood (up to 46 years of age). Most of the putative QKI
target mRNAs showed increased expression with increasing age in
prefrontal cortex. However, there was little evidence of developmental
regulation of these mRNAs in hippocampus.

Using small interfering RNA, Radomska et al. (2013) found that knockdown
of QKI7 in cultured human astrocytes reduced expression of an astrocyte
differentiation marker, GFAP (137780), but did not reduce cell
viability. The dominant GFAP variant expressed in the astrocytes,
GFAP-alpha, was the most highly downregulated. Radomska et al. (2013)
identified a core QKI regulatory element (QRE) in the 3-prime UTR of the
GFAP-alpha transcript and a potential upstream half-site. The QRE, but
not the half-site, was conserved in mouse Gfap. Exposure of astrocytes
to the antipsychotic drug haloperidol specifically increased expression
of QKI7 and GFAP transcripts.

CYTOGENETICS

Backx et al. (2010) reported a woman with borderline mental retardation
and dysmorphic features who had a de novo reciprocal balanced
translocation t(5;6)(q23.1;q26) disrupting the QKI gene. The 5q
breakpoint occurred in a gene desert. RNA studies showed a 50% reduction
in QKI expression, consistent with haploinsufficiency. She presented at
birth with hypotonia, short neck, genital hypoplasia with underdeveloped
labia majora, and facial dysmorphism including epicanthal folds, narrow
palpebral fissures, broad nasal bridge with small nose and bulbous tip,
small mouth with downturned corners, a long philtrum, and small
protruding cupped ears. She attended special education schools.
Evaluation at age 23 years showed relative microcephaly,
microretrognathia, small mouth with high-arched palate, myopia, and
nasal speech. She also had inverted nipples and irregular menses.
Seizures and brain anomalies were not present.

Backx et al. (2010) provided a literature review of 18 patients reported
with chromosome 6qter deletions and 2 patients reported with
interstitial 6q deletion. All deletions included the QKI gene. They
noted that while the deletion sizes varied a common recognizable
phenotype of intellectual disabilities, hypotonia, seizures, brain
anomalies, and specific dysmorphic facial features could be distilled
for the chromosome 6qter deletion syndrome.

ANIMAL MODEL

Recessive mutations in the mouse quaking gene affect myelination and
embryogenesis and can be embryonic lethal. A spontaneous, recessive
quaking mutation, qk(v), results in viable mice with a severe deficit in
myelin, leading to rapid tremor by postnatal day 10. By Northern blot
analysis, Ebersole et al. (1996) detected a truncated Qki message in
brains of qk(v) mice.

Hardy et al. (1996) found that Qki-6 and Qki-7 were absent from
myelin-forming cells in qk(v) mice. Qki-5 was absent only from
oligodendrocytes of tracts from severely affected qk(v) brain regions.

Wu et al. (2002) found misregulated alternative splicing of several
myelin genes in qk(v) mice.

Lu et al. (2003) presented evidence that the qk(v) mutation affects an
enhancer required for expression of Qki in myelinating cells but not in
other tissues.

Chen and Richard (1998) determined that a point mutation within the QUA1
region of Qk1 caused embryonic lethality in mice. The mutation abolished
Qk1 self-association but had no effect on RNA-binding activity.
Expression of wildtype Qk1 or a lethal mutant Qk1 deficient in
self-association but not RNA binding induced cell death by apoptosis in
a mouse fibroblast cell line. The lethal Qk1 mutant was more potent at
inducing apoptosis.

Noveroske et al. (2002) found that embryonic mice with a lethal point
mutation in Qki had defective yolk sac vascular remodeling and abnormal
vessels in the embryo proper at midgestation, coinciding with embryonic
death.

Noveroske et al. (2005) isolated qk(e5), an N-ethyl-N-nitrosurea-induced
viable allele of mouse Qki. Unlike qk(v)/qk(v) mice, qk(e5)/qk(e5) mice
had early-onset seizures, severe ataxia, and a dramatically reduced life
span. Ultrastructural analysis of qk(e5)/qk(e5) brains revealed severe
dysmyelination when compared with both wildtype and qk(v)/qk(v) brains.
Young adult qk(e5)/qk(e5) mice exhibited Purkinje cell axonal swellings
indicative of neurodegeneration, which is not seen in young adult
qk(v)/qk(v) mice. The molecular defect in the qk(e5) allele was not
evident, but protein expression studies showed that qk(e5)/qk(e5)
postnatal oligodendrocytes lacked Qki-6 and Qki-7 and had reduced Qki-5
levels. Several oligodendrocyte developmental markers were present in
qk(e5)/qk(e5) postnatal brain, but Cnp (123830) and Mbp levels were
considerably reduced. Noveroske et al. (2005) noted that qk(v) is a
large deletion that affects expression of Pacrg (608427) and Parkin
(PARK2; 602544) in addition to Qki, complicating interpretation of its
neuropathology. Thus, they suggested that qk(e5) may be useful in
studying QKI regulation in the developing central nervous system and its
role in myelination.

Wilson et al. (2010) noted that the qk(v) phenotype, which includes
dysmyelination of the central nervous system and male sterility, is due
to reduced expression of Qk and a complete lack of Pacrg expression,
respectively. Since Pacrg is required for correct development of the
spermatozoan flagella (a specialized type of motile cilia), Wilson et
al. (2010) analyzed qk(v) mutant mice for evidence of cilial
dysfunction. Histologic and magnetic resonance imaging analyses
demonstrated that qk(v) mutant mice were affected by acquired,
communicating hydrocephalus (HC). Structure of axonemal microtubules and
density of ciliated cells were normal, and cilia length was similar to
wildtype littermates. There was a reduction in ependymal cilial beat
frequency and cilial-mediated flow in qk(v) mutant mice compared with
wildtype littermate controls. Transgenic expression of Pacrg was
necessary and sufficient to correct this deficit and rescue the HC
phenotype in the qk(v) mutant. Wilson et al. (2010) concluded that Pacrg
is required for motile cilia function and may be involved in the
pathogenesis of human ciliopathies, such as HC, asthenospermia, and
primary ciliary dyskinesia.

611220	TITLE *611220 UNC45, C. ELEGANS, HOMOLOG OF, B; UNC45B
;;SMUNC45
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

UNC45B plays a role in myoblast fusion and sarcomere organization (Price
et al., 2002).

CLONING

By database analysis using C. elegans unc45 sequence as probe, followed
by PCR of a human heart cDNA library, Price et al. (2002) cloned UNC45B,
which they called SMUNC45. The deduced 931-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 103.4 kD and shares 95% and 56% amino acid
identity with mouse Unc45b and human UNC45A (611219), respectively.
UNC45B contains an N-terminal triple TPR motif, a unique central region,
and a C-terminal UNC45/Cro1/She4p (UCS) domain. EST database analysis
showed human UNC45B expression in cDNA libraries derived mostly from
heart and tissues containing heart and skeletal muscle. The authors also
cloned mouse Unc45b, and Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues
detected high expression in skeletal muscle, heart, and whole embryo,
with low levels detected in lung. In situ hybridization of mouse embryos
detected Unc45b expression in the heart at 8.75 days gestation. Unc45b
expression was not initially detected in proliferating mouse C2C12
skeletal muscle cells but appeared later during differentiation when
aligned myogenic cells were actively fusing.

GENE FUNCTION

Price et al. (2002) showed that antisense oligonucleotide inhibition of
mouse Unc45b mRNA expression reduced myoblast fusion and altered
sarcomere formation in C2C12 cells. The altered sarcomere organization
was not associated with any changes in skeletal myosin heavy chain
(MYH1; 160730) protein levels.

GENE STRUCTURE

Price et al. (2002) determined that the UNC45B gene contains 19 exons
spanning 38 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Price et al. (2002) mapped the UNC45B gene
to chromosome 17q11. They mapped the mouse Unc45b gene to the syntenic
region on mouse chromosome 11.

191329	TITLE *191329 UBIQUINOL-CYTOCHROME c REDUCTASE CORE PROTEIN II; UQCRC2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The UQCRC2 gene encodes a subunit of mitochondrial complex III (Duncan
et al., 1993). See also UQCRC1 (191328).

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization to metaphase chromosomes, Duncan et al. (1993)
assigned the UQCRC2 gene to human chromosome 16p12, thus confirming that
it is encoded by the nuclear rather than the mitochondrial genome. Two
other subunits of mitochondrial complex III (CYC1, 123980; UQPC, 191330)
map to chromosome 8.

GENE FUNCTION

Wisloff et al. (2005) hypothesized that artificial selection of rats
based on low and high intrinsic exercise capacity would yield models
that also contrast for cardiovascular disease risk. After 11
generations, rats with low aerobic capacity scored higher on
cardiovascular risk factors that constitute the metabolic syndrome. The
decrease in aerobic capacity was associated with decreases in the
amounts of transcription factors required for mitochondrial biogenesis
and in the amounts of oxidative enzymes in skeletal muscle. Wisloff et
al. (2005) found that the amount of PPARG (601487), PPARG
coactivator-1-alpha (PPARGC1A; 604517), ubiquinol-cytochrome c
oxidoreductase core 2 subunit (UQCRC2), cytochrome c oxidase subunit I
(MTCO1; 516030), uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2; 601693), and ATP synthase
H(+)-transporting mitochondrial F1 complex (F1-ATP synthase; see 108729)
were markedly reduced in the low capacity runner rats in comparison with
the high capacity runners. The uniform decline in these proteins was
consistent with the hypothesis that reduced aerobic metabolism plays a
causal role in the development of the differences between the low
capacity runner and high capacity runner rats. Wisloff et al. (2005)
concluded that impairment of mitochondrial function may link reduced
fitness to cardiovascular and metabolic disease.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 affected individuals from a large consanguineous Mexican kindred
with mitochondrial complex III deficiency nuclear type 5 (MC3DN5;
615160), Miyake et al. (2013) identified a homozygous mutation in the
UQCRC2 gene (R183W; 191329.0001). Structural analysis indicated that the
substitution would disrupt the hydrophobic core at the interface of the
UQCRC2-containing complex, resulting in destabilization of complex III.
In vitro studies showed that the mutant protein localized properly to
the mitochondria but had decreased expression compared to wildtype,
suggesting protein instability. Complex III activity in one of the
patient's cells was decreased to 50% of normal, whereas complex I
activity was increased and complex IV activity was normal. The patient's
cells also showed severely decreased levels of complex III assembly and
decreased levels of the supercomplex formed from complexes I, III, and
IV. The patients had neonatal onset of severe metabolic acidosis
associated with hyperammonemia and hypoglycemia. Physical signs included
tachypnea and poor sucking. Two of the patients showed normal growth and
development by early childhood despite multiple episodes of metabolic
decompensation, usually associated with illness. The third patient had a
similar disease course, but showed mild development delay at age 18
months.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX III DEFICIENCY, NUCLEAR TYPE 5
UQCRC2, ARG183TRP

In 3 affected individuals from a large consanguineous Mexican kindred
with mitochondrial complex III deficiency, nuclear type 5 (MC3DN5;
615160), Miyake et al. (2013) identified a homozygous 547C-T transition
in the UQCRC2 gene, resulting in an arg183-to-trp (R183W) substitution
at a highly conserved residue. The mutation, which was found by exome
sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing, was not present in 80
Mexican or 750 Japanese control alleles. Three unaffected family members
were heterozygous for the mutation. Structural analysis indicated that
the substitution would disrupt the hydrophobic core at the interface of
the UQCRC2-containing complex, resulting in destabilization of complex
III. In vitro studies showed that the mutant protein localized properly
to the mitochondria but had decreased expression compared to wildtype,
suggesting protein instability. Complex III activity in one of the
patient's cells was decreased to 50% of normal, whereas complex I
activity was increased and complex IV activity was normal. Patients
cells also showed severely decreased levels of complex III assembly and
decreased levels of the supercomplex formed from complexes I, III, and
IV.

300144	TITLE *300144 GLUTAMATE DEHYDROGENASE 2; GLUD2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Glutamate dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.1.3) catalyzes the reversible oxidative
deamination of glutamate to alpha-ketoglutarate using NAD and/or NADP as
cofactors. See also GLUD1 (138130).

CLONING

Since blindness due to neuroretinal degeneration occurs in some types of
multiple system atrophy, Shashidharan et al. (1994) searched for
retinal-specific GLUD mRNA(s) by screening a retinal cDNA library. A
novel cDNA encoded by an X-linked intronless gene was cloned. Reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of human tissues
demonstrated that the novel cDNA is expressed in human retina, testis,
and, at a lower level, brain. In vitro translation of mRNAs derived from
GLUD1 and the new gene, called GLUD2, generated proteins with distinct
electrophoretic characteristics. The retinal cDNA was expressed in the
baculovirus heterologous system, producing a protein capable of
catalyzing the oxidative deamination of glutamate. Expression of the
GLUD2 gene in human retina was of particular interest in view of the
finding that glutamate is an important retinal excitatory transmitter.

GENE FUNCTION

Partial deficiency of glutamate dehydrogenase has been found in patients
with various neurodegenerative disorders and a deficiency has been
thought to cause neuroexcitotoxic nerve cell death (Plaitakis et al.,
1982, 1984). The brains of these patients show loss of glutamate
receptors and a selective atrophy of regions that receive glutamatergic
terminals and are normally rich in glutamate dehydrogenase
immunoreactivity. In these regions, the enzyme is localized in
astrocytic processes associated with glutamatergic terminals and is
thought to be involved in the detoxification of transmitter glutamate.
Given the extensive nature of the glutamatergic pathways in the brain,
glutamate dehydrogenase might play a role in a number of human
neurodegenerations.

GENE STRUCTURE

The GLUD2 gene consists of 11 exons (Wan and Francke, 1998).

MAPPING

Shashidharan et al. (1994) mapped the GLUD2 gene to the X chromosome by
PCR amplification of DNA derived from hamster/human hybrid lines that
contained human chromosome 10 or X. Southern blot analysis of the
amplified products, using oligonucleotide probes capable of
discriminating between the GLUD1 and GLUD2 genes, revealed that the
GLUD2 gene is linked to the human X chromosome, whereas the GLUD1 gene
is linked to the human chromosome 10. Also, Southern blot analysis of
genomic DNA from males and females showed that females possess a double
dose of the GLUD2 gene.

Jung et al. (1989) and Anagnou et al. (1993) mapped the GLUD2 gene to
Xq. Online information in the dbSTS database was cited by Wan and
Francke (1998) as indicating that the GLUD2 gene is located at Xq25.
Francke (1998) stated that the GLUD2 gene was indirectly mapped to Xq25
by sequence identity to a radiation hybrid mapped STS.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Wan and Francke (1998) examined the GLUD2 gene as the possible site of
mutations causing Rett syndrome (RTT; 312750), an X-linked dominant
neurodevelopmental disorder lethal in hemizygous males. The intronless
gene GLUD2 is involved in the metabolism of glutamate, a
neurotransmitter reported to be elevated in the spinal fluid of RTT
individuals. No mutations in the GLUD2 gene were found in 22 RTT
patients.

Plaitakis et al. (2010) identified a 1492T-G polymorphism in the GLUD2
gene, resulting in a ser445-to-ala (S445A; 300144.0001) substitution,
that was associated with earlier age of onset in 2 cohorts of patients
with Parkinson disease (PD; 168600). Among 584 Greek patients, 1492G
hemizygous males developed PD 8 to 13 years earlier than did patients
with the T (p = 0.003), the G/T (p less than 0.001), or the T/T (p =
0.01) genotype. Among 224 North American patients, 1492G hemizygotes
also developed PD earlier than those with other genotypes, but the mean
age differences reached statistical significance only when G hemizygotes
were compared to G/T heterozygotes (mean age difference: 13.1 years, p
less than 0.05). The substitution was demonstrated to confer a gain of
function, which Plaitakis et al. (2010) postulated may increase
glutamate oxidation and the production of reactive oxygen species in the
brain.

EVOLUTION

Shashidharan et al. (1994) noted that several other functionless
intronless genes generated by reverse transcription and insertion into
the human genome as retroposons have been identified. Some of these are
expressed in neural tissues, encoding for G protein-linked receptors, or
in testis, encoding for the metabolic enzymes pyruvate dehydrogenase and
phosphoglycerate kinase. In contrast, the GLUD2 intronless gene is
expressed in both neural and testicular tissues. The localization of the
GLUD2 gene to the X chromosome and of GLUD1 to chromosome 10 represents
a reversal of the chromosomal loci of the 2 forms of pyruvate
dehydrogenase and phosphoglycerate kinase; the intronless genes of
pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDHA2; 179061) and phosphoglycerate kinase
(PGK2; 172270) map to autosomal chromosomes, while their
intron-containing genes (PDHA1, 300502; PGK1, 311800) map to the X
chromosome. Retroposition of the latter 2 genes to autosomal chromosomes
may have occurred in order to serve the metabolic needs of sperm cells,
only half of which contain an X chromosome.

The enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase is important for recycling the chief
excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate, during neurotransmission. It
exists in housekeeping and brain-specific isotypes encoded by GLUD1
(138130) and GLUD2, respectively. Burki and Kaessmann (2004) showed that
GLUD2 originated by retroposition from GLUD1 in the hominoid ancestor
less than 23 million years ago. The amino acid changes responsible for
the unique brain-specific properties of the enzyme derived from GLUD2
occurred during a period of positive selection after the duplication
event. The genes ASPM (605481) and MCPH1 (607117), determinants of brain
size, also showed accelerated evolution during that time. Thus higher
neuronal activity may have coevolved with greater brain size and other
changes. GLUD2 probably contributed to enhanced brain function in humans
and apes by permitting higher neurotransmitter flux. In a commentary on
the work of Burki and Kaessmann (2004), Varki (2004) discussed the
apparent role of the retrotransposed gene duplicate GLUD2, which
acquired brain-specific expression and functions affecting the
neurotransmitter glutamate.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PARKINSON DISEASE, AGE OF ONSET, MODIFIER
GLUD2, SER445ALA

Plaitakis et al. (2010) identified a 1492T-G polymorphism in the GLUD2
gene, resulting in a ser445-to-ala (S445A) substitution in the
regulatory domain, that was associated with earlier age of onset in 2
cohorts of patients with Parkinson disease (PD; 168600). Among 584 Greek
patients, 1492G hemizygous males developed PD 8 to 13 years earlier than
did patients with the T (p = 0.003), the G/T (p less than 0.001), or the
T/T (p = 0.01) genotype. Among 224 North American patients, 1492G
hemizygotes also developed PD earlier than those with other genotypes,
but the mean age differences reached statistical significance only when
G hemizygotes were compared to G/T heterozygotes (mean age difference:
13.1 years, p less than 0.05). Gender did not affect the age at
development of PD. The frequency of the G allele was rare (3.6% in the
Greek and 4.3% in the American populations). In vitro functional
expression studies showed that the variant ala445 enzyme had increased
basal activity and thermal stability compared to wildtype. The variant
protein showed resistance to suppression by GTP, but was sensitive to
inhibition by estrogen. The findings suggested an overall gain of
function and explained the lack of effect in female heterozygous PD
patients. Plaitakis et al. (2010) postulated that increased glutamate
oxidation in the brain may increase reactive oxygen species, which would
accelerate a degenerative process.

609317	TITLE *609317 TRIPARTITE MOTIF-CONTAINING PROTEIN 36; TRIM36
;;RBCC728
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a B-box domain consensus sequence to screen EST databases for
novel TRIM family members, Reymond et al. (2001) identified and cloned
mouse and human TRIM36. The deduced protein contains an N-terminal RING
domain, B-box-1 and B-box-2 domains, and a coiled-coil region.

By sequencing a region of chromosome 5 duplicated in a renal cell
carcinoma, Balint et al. (2004) identified TRIM36, which they designated
RBCC728. They obtained the full-length cDNA by PCR of fetal brain and
adult kidney cDNA libraries. The deduced 728-amino acid protein has an
N-terminal RING finger C3HC4 structure, 2 B-boxes, a coiled-coil region,
a fibronectin type III (see 135600) domain and a C-terminal domain found
in SPRY proteins (see SPRY1; 602465). TRIM36 also contains a bipartite
nuclear localization signal. TRIM36 shares 26% amino acid identity with
MID1 (300552). Quantitative RT-PCR detected highest TRIM36 expression in
testis, followed by prostate and brain, with weak expression in kidney,
lung, and heart. TRIM36 expression was upregulated in some prostate
cancers compared with normal tissue. Immunohistochemical analysis of
recombinant and endogenous TRIM36 in COS-7 cells showed the protein
expressed in a slightly filamentous staining pattern in the cytoplasm.
TRIM36 often accumulated near sites of cell-cell contact, and mitotic
cells were negative for TRIM36 staining.

GENE STRUCTURE

Balint et al. (2004) determined that the TRIM36 gene contains 10 exons
and spans 55 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Reymond et al. (2001) mapped the TRIM36
gene to chromosome 5q22. By shotgun sequencing, Balint et al. (2004)
identified the TRIM36 gene within a BAC mapped to chromosome 5q22.3.

;;PDCD6-INTERACTING PROTEIN;;
ALG2-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1; AIP1;;
ALG2-INTERACTING PROTEIN X; ALIX;;
KIAA1375
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PDCD6IP interacts with proteins associated with apoptosis, including
PDCD6 (601057), and with endophilins, which regulate membrane shape
(Chatellard-Causse et al., 2002).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned PDCD6IP, which they designated
KIAA1375. RT-PCR ELISA detected moderate expression in all adult and
fetal tissues tested except adult lung, spleen, and pancreas and fetal
brain, which all showed low expression. Moderate expression was detected
in all individual brain regions examined.

Wu et al. (2001) cloned full-length PDCD6IP, which they designated p95,
by searching databases for sequences similar to YNK1, the C. elegans
PDCD6IP homolog, followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE of a placenta cDNA
library. The deduced 868-amino acid PDCD6IP protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 96 kD. It has a proline-rich C terminus containing
several PxxP motifs, which are SRC (190090) homology domain-3
(SH3)-binding domains. PDCD6IP also contains a tyrosine
autophosphorylation consensus sequence that is conserved with SRC family
members, as well as several additional conserved tyrosines. PDCD6IP
shares significant homology with proteins from mouse, Xenopus,
Drosophila, several yeast species, and Arabidopsis. Northern blot
analysis detected an endogenous 3.5-kb transcript in HeLa cell RNA.
Western blot analysis of HeLa cell lysates determined that the PDCD6IP
protein has an apparent molecular mass of 95 kD.

Missotten et al. (1999) cloned mouse Pdcd6ip, which they called Alix, in
a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a brain cDNA library using Alg2 (PDCD6) as
bait. The deduced 869-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass
of about 96 kD. The authors noted that, in addition to several
SH3-binding domains, the C terminus of Alix contains a WW-binding
domain. Northern blot analysis detected 3.5- and 6.5-kb transcripts in
all adult mouse tissues tested.

GENE FUNCTION

Normal epithelial cells stop proliferating in culture following
cell-cell contact due to induction of G1 phase arrest in the cell cycle.
However, malignant HeLa cells do not inhibit proliferation upon
cell-cell contact and proceed toward multilayer growth. Wu et al. (2001)
determined that overexpression of PDCD6IP restored the ability of HeLa
cells to undergo G1 phase arrest and form a monolayer culture after
confluence. Overexpression of PDCD6IP did not inhibit HeLa cell growth
in sparse cultures.

Wu et al. (2002) found that overexpression of PDCD6IP in HeLa cells
promoted detachment-induced apoptosis, inhibited detachment of viable
cells from the substratum, and reduced tumorigenicity following
injection into nude mice. Overexpression in mouse fibroblasts promoted
flat cell morphology and slowed cell proliferation. Transfection of
antisense PDCD6IP had the opposite effects, with more rounded fibroblast
morphology and dense growth.

Missotten et al. (1999) determined that interaction between mouse Alix
and Alg2 is calcium-dependent.

Vito et al. (1999) determined that mouse Alix and Alg2 colocalized in
the cytosol of fibroblasts and required calcium for their association.
Overexpression of the C terminus of Alix protected HeLa and COS cells
from apoptosis induced by withdrawal of trophic factors.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Chatellard-Causse et al. (2002) determined
that mouse Alix binds to the endophilins Sh3p4 (604465), Sh3p8 (601768),
and Sh3p13 (603362). Coimmunoprecipitation and overlay experiments with
truncation mutants demonstrated that the SH3 domains of endophilins bind
to the C terminus of Alix, specifically within a 14-amino acid region
containing a PxRPPPP consensus sequence. Upon overexpression in human
embryonic kidney cells, full-length Alix and the N terminus of Alix
concentrated in the perinuclear region and at the cell periphery in
lamellipodia and filopodia. Overexpression of the C terminus of Alix in
several cell lines led to concentration around perinuclear vesicles and
to cytoplasmic vacuolization into tubulovesicular structures.
Immunolocalization revealed that the structures were lined by Alix and
endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins. Vacuolization was enhanced upon
coexpression of with Sh3p4, and Alix lacking the proline-rich domain did
not cause vacuolization when overexpressed alone or with Sh3p4.

Matsuo et al. (2004) found that the unconventional phospholipid
lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA) could induce the formation of
multivesicular liposomes that resembled the multivesicular endosomes
that exist where this lipid is found in vivo. This process depended on
the same pH gradient that exists across endosome membranes in vivo and
was selectively controlled by Alix. In turn, Alix regulated the
organization of LBPA-containing endosomes in vivo.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, coimmunoprecipitation analysis, and in vitro
protein pull-down assays, Katoh et al. (2003) showed that CHMP4B
(610897) interacted with ALIX. Overexpression of CHMP4B in HeLa cells
caused redistribution of ALIX from the cytoplasm to the perinuclear
area, where the 2 proteins colocalized. Transient overexpression of the
ALIX N-terminal region in HEK293 cells stably expressing CHMP4B induced
formation of vesicle-like structures in which CHMP4B and truncated ALIX
colocalized. A dominant-negative form of the AAA-type ATPase SKD1
(VPS4B; 609983), which plays critical roles in the endocytic pathway,
coimmunoprecipitated with CHMP4B. Furthermore, both CHMP4B and ALIX
colocalized with dominant-negative SKD1 in perinuclear dot-like
distributions in transfected HeLa cells, suggesting that the 3 proteins
are involved in formation of multivesicular bodies.

Using coimmunoprecipitation analysis and in vitro pull-down assays,
Katoh et al. (2004) showed that ALIX interacted with all 3 CHMP4
proteins, although the interaction was stronger between ALIX and CHMP4B
than between ALIX and CHMP4A (610051) or CHMP4C (610899).

Carlton and Martin-Serrano (2007) found that 2 proteins involved in
HIV-1 budding--tumor susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101; 601387), a subunit
of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport 1 (ESCRT-1), and
ALIX, an ESCRT-associated protein--were recruited to the midbody during
cytokinesis by interaction with centrosome protein 55 (CEP55; 610000), a
centrosome and midbody protein essential for abscission. TSG101, ALIX,
and possibly other components of ESCRT-1 were required for the
completion of cytokinesis. Carlton and Martin-Serrano (2007) concluded
that thus, HIV-1 budding and cytokinesis use a similar subset of
cellular components to carry out topologically similar membrane fission
events.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a human T-cell cDNA library, followed by
coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence analyses, Chen et al.
(2009) identified ALIX as a binding partner for GAL3 (LGALS3; 153619)
and showed that ALIX translocated to the immunologic synapse in
activated T cells. Chen et al. (2009) concluded that GAL3 is an
inhibitory regulator of T-cell activation and that it functions
intracellularly by promoting T-cell receptor downregulation, possibly
through modulation of ALIX function at the immunologic synapse.

Feng et al. (2013) showed that hepatitis A virus (HAV) released from
cells is cloaked in host-derived membranes, thereby protecting the
virion from antibody-mediated neutralization. The enveloped viruses
(eHAV) resemble exosomes, small vesicles that are important in
intercellular communications. They are fully infectious, sensitive to
extraction with chloroform, and circulate in the blood of infected
humans. Their biogenesis is dependent on host proteins associated with
endosomal-sorting complexes required for transport, namely VPS4B and
ALIX. Feng et al. (2013) concluded that while the hijacking of membranes
by HAV facilitates escape from neutralizing antibodies and probably
promotes virus spread within the liver, anti-capsid antibodies restrict
replication after infection with eHAV, suggesting a possible explanation
for prophylaxis after exposure.

gene to chromosome 3 (TMAP sts-R60314).

TIGHT JUNCTION PROTEIN 4; TJP4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of a mouse 11-day-old embryo library using
human DLG2 (603583) SH3 and GK domains as bait, Kawabe et al. (2001)
cloned mouse Tjap1, which they called Pilt. By database analysis, they
identified full-length human TJAP1, which encodes a 547-amino acid
protein with a calculated molecular mass of 60.7 kD. TJAP1 contains an
N-terminal coiled-coil domain and a central proline-rich region, and
shares 74% amino acid identity with its mouse homolog. TJAP1 shares 43%
and 51% amino acid identity over its N-terminal and C-terminal regions,
respectively, with the same regions of BEGAIN. SDS-PAGE detected TJAP1
as an 86-kD band. Northern blot analysis detected an approximately
3.0-kb transcript in all 16 human tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunofluorescence microscopy of mouse mammary tumor cells, Kawabe et
al. (2001) localized TJAP1 to cell-cell junctions where it colocalized
with ZO-1 (TJP1; 601009) at tight junctions. Using endogenous and stably
expressed TJAP1, the authors confirmed colocalization of TJAP1 and ZO-1
to tight junctions in small intestine cells where TJAP1 localized to the
Golgi complex. TJAP1 was absent from apical junctions and desmosomes. By
observing TJAP1 incorporation into cell-cell junctions over time in a
mouse wound healing model, the authors showed that TJAP1 was
incorporated into tight junctions at the very late stages of cell-cell
junction formation. Kawabe et al. (2001) used GST pull-down assays to
confirm that TJAP1 binds DLG2. Immunohistochemical studies using
cadherin deficient L-cells expressing claudin-1 (CLDN1; 603718) or JAM
(JAM1; 605721) showed no evidence of interaction between TJAP1 and
either of these 2 proteins.

;;NUDIX MOTIF 2;;
AP4A HYDROLASE 1; APAH1
DESCRIPTION AP4A hydrolase is the enzyme responsible for maintaining the
intracellular level of the dinucleoside AP4A (diadenosine
5-prime,5-triple prime-P(1),P(4)-tetraphosphate). Human AP4A hydrolase
is a member of the MutT (600312) motif, or 'nudix,' family of nucleotide
hydrolases, whose function may be to rid the cell of toxic nucleotide
metabolites. Thorne et al. (1995) isolated an AP4A hydrolase cDNA from a
human fetal liver and spleen normalized cDNA library. The gene,
designated APAH1, encodes a 147-amino acid polypeptide containing a MutT
sequence motif.

McLennan et al. (1998) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to map
the APAH1 gene to human chromosome 9p13. They further localized the gene
relative to other genes and markers in the region and obtained the order
tel--D9S165--D9S1878--CNTFR (118946)--IL11RA (600939)--APAH1--GALT
(606999)--D9S163--CHH (250250)--D9S50--cen.

McLennan et al. (1998) suggested that, in light of evidence for the
existence of several tumor suppressor genes in the 9p13 region, and also
given that the mammalian AP3A hydrolase gene (FHIT; 601153) is a
possible tumor suppressor gene, APAH1 may be a candidate tumor
suppressor gene as well.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TAS2R30 belongs to a family of intronless genes that encode highly
related bitter taste receptors (TAS2Rs). TAS2Rs are G protein-coupled
receptors, which are characterized by 7 transmembrane domains (summary
by Fischer et al., 2005). For further information on the TAS2R gene
family, see 604791.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Fischer et al. (2005) mapped the TAS2R30
gene, which they called T2R47, to a small TAS2R gene cluster on
chromosome 1. However, Hartz (2011) mapped the TAS2R30 gene to
chromosome 12p13.2 based on an alignment of the TAS2R30 sequence
(GenBank GENBANK AY724940) with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

IKAROS; IK1;;
LYF1
IKAROS/BCL6 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Ikaros proteins are lymphoid-restricted zinc finger transcription
factors that are considered master regulators of lymphocyte
differentiation. Klug et al. (1998) noted that there are at least 8
alternatively spliced transcripts of the Ikaros gene that encode
isoforms with common N-terminal and C-terminal domains. By screening a
Jurkat T-cell cDNA library with a mouse Ikaros cDNA, Molnar et al.
(1996) isolated human Ikaros cDNAs. The deduced human and mouse Ikaros
proteins are 95% identical. RT-PCR of human thymus and peripheral blood
leukocyte mRNAs detected 6 Ikaros splicing variants which were expressed
at similar levels and ratios as the corresponding mouse leukocyte Ikaros
transcripts. The authors found that Ikaros proteins are conserved in
sequence composition and relative expression between human T cells and
mouse thymocytes. Northern blot analysis demonstrated the expression of
7.5- and 4.5-kb Ikaros transcripts in human thymus, spleen, and
peripheral blood leukocytes.

By PCR using primers based on a conserved nucleotide sequence of various
zinc finger proteins, Nietfeld and Meyerhans (1996) cloned human bone
marrow cDNAs encoding Ikaros, which they designated IK1. The deduced
519-amino acid protein is 93% identical to the mouse Ikaros isoform
1/LyF1 isoform VI and contains 4 N-terminal and 2 C-terminal zinc finger
domains. The authors detected 3 human mRNA species by Northern blot
analysis: a 4.4-kb transcript, which was prominent in peripheral blood
leukocytes; a 6.0-kb transcript, which was strongly expressed in spleen,
thymus, lymph node, and bone marrow; and a 7.0-kb transcript. They
stated that the human and mouse Ikaros genes have similar overall
transcription patterns.

Dijon et al. (2008) stated that the N-terminal Kruppel-like zinc finger
domain of Ikaros proteins is involved in DNA binding, while the
C-terminal zinc finger domain mediates homo- or heterodimerization with
other Ikaros proteins. Alternative splicing of exons 3 to 6 produces
Ikaros isoforms with 0 to 4 N-terminal zinc fingers, and those with at
least 3 efficiently bind DNA. The DNA-binding Ikaros isoforms include
IK1, IK2, IK3, and IKX, and IK4 can bind DNA on palindromic sequences.
IK5, IK6, IK7, and IK8 are considered dominant-negative isoforms due to
their capacity to bind other isoforms and their inefficiency in binding
DNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Harker et al. (2002) showed that Ikaros may play an important role in
CD4 (186940) versus CD8 (see CD8A; 186910) lineage commitment decisions
by demonstrating: (1) that it binds to regulatory elements in the
endogenous CD8A locus in vivo using thymocyte chromatin
immunoprecipitations; (2) that Ikaros suppresses position effect
variegation of transgenes driven by CD8 regulatory elements; and (3)
that mice with reduced levels of Ikaros and Aiolos (606221) show an
apparent increase in CD4 populations with immature phenotype, i.e.,
cells that fail to activate the CD8A gene. The authors proposed that
Ikaros family members function as activators of the CD8A gene and that
their associated activities are critical for appropriate chromatin
remodeling transitions during thymocyte differentiation and lineage
commitment.

Ezzat et al. (2005) demonstrated that Ikaros is expressed in the
hormone-producing pituitary corticomelanotroph cells of mice, where it
binds the proopiomelanocortin promoter and regulates endogenous gene
expression. Ikaros-null mice had contraction of the pituitary
corticomelanotroph population, reduced circulating adrenocorticotrophic
hormone levels, and adrenal glucocorticoid insufficiency. Hematopoietic
reconstitution failed to correct this hormonal deficit, but the
phenotype of reduced body weight and diminished survival was rescued by
systemic glucocorticoid-hormone administration. Ezzat et al. (2005)
concluded that Ikaros plays a role in orchestrating immune-endocrine
development and function.

Yap et al. (2005) identified Ikaros-binding elements in the 5-prime
flanking regions of pufferfish, mouse, and human STAT4 (600558).
Transactivation, electrophoretic mobility shift, and RNA interference
analyses showed that Ikaros bound to the STAT4 promoter and was involved
in regulation of STAT4 in human T cells.

Dijon et al. (2008) found that purified CD34 (142230)-positive human
cord blood cells and adult peripheral blood cells that were cultured
under erythroid conditions expressed the DNA-binding Ikaros isoforms IK1
through IK4, but not the dominant-negative isoform IK6.
Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that expression of IK6 in these
cells resulted in complex formation between IK6 and IK1, and IK6
decreased cell number and increased cell death. IK6 overexpression
disturbed erythroid differentiation and expression of erythroid-specific
genes, although it had no effect on Ikaros expression, and favored
myelopoiesis by promoting expression of myeloid-specific genes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Dijon et al. (2008) stated that the IKZF1 gene contains 7 translated
exons.

MAPPING

Using somatic cell hybrid DNAs, Molnar et al. (1996) mapped the human
Ikaros gene to 7p13-p11.1, near the EGFR gene (131550). They mapped the
mouse Ikaros gene to chromosome 11 by interspecific backcross analysis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Ikaros is required for normal lymphocyte development. Germline mutant
mice that express only non-DNA-binding dominant-negative 'leukemogenic'
Ikaros isoforms lacking critical N-terminal zinc fingers develop an
aggressive form of lymphoblastic leukemia 3 to 6 months after birth (see
'Animal Model' below). These facts prompted Sun et al. (1999) to seek
molecular abnormalities involving the Ikaros gene in acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL2; 613067) in infants. In leukemic cells from 12 ALL
infants less than 1 year of age, Sun et al. (1999) found high-level
expression of dominant-negative isoforms of Ikaros with abnormal
subcellular compartmentalization patterns. PCR cloning and nucleotide
sequencing were used to identify the specific Ikaros isoforms and detect
Ikaros gene mutations in these cells. Leukemic cells from 7 of 7 infants
with ALL, including 5 of 5 MLL-AF4-positive (159557) infants, expressed
dominant-negative Ikaros isoforms IK4, IK7, and IK8 that lack critical
N-terminal zinc fingers. In 6 of 7 patients, Sun et al. (1999) detected
an in-frame deletion of 10 amino acids (KSSMPQKFLG) upstream of the
transcription-activation domain adjacent to the C-terminal zinc fingers
of IK2, IK4, IK7, and IK8. In contrast, only wildtype IK1 and IK2
isoforms with normal nuclear localization were found in normal infant
bone marrow cells and infant thymocytes. These results implicated the
expression of dominant-negative Ikaros isoforms and the disruption of
normal Ikaros function in the leukemogenesis of ALL in infants.

Nakase et al. (2000) found overexpression of the dominant-negative IK6
isoform in 14 of 41 B-cell patients with adult B-cell ALL. None of the
other dominant-negative isoforms of the Ikaros gene were detected by
RT-PCR analysis. Southern blot analysis with PstI digestion revealed
that those patients with the dominant-negative IK6 isoform might have
small mutations in the Ikaros locus. The results suggested that Ikaros
plays a key role in human B-cell malignancies through the
dominant-negative isoform IK6.

Using RT-PCR to detect Ikaros isoforms with the 30-base deletion in exon
6, Payne et al. (2001) showed that transcripts for IK1 and IK1 with the
deletion were present in normal cord blood and bone marrow, as well as
in 3 ALL cell lines. In addition, they identified an isoform, IKX, that
was identical to IK3 except that it included exon 6; IKX was generated
from a novel exon combination with and without the 30-base deletion.
Payne et al. (2001) detected multiple DNA-binding and nonbinding
isoforms with a 60-base insertion linked to leukemia expressed at the
RNA level in normal hemopoietic cells. Immunoblot analysis indicated
that the predominant isoform in normal cells is IKX, while the
predominant form in leukemic cells is IK1.

In a genomewide analysis of leukemic cells from 242 pediatric ALL
patients using high resolution, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
arrays and genomic DNA sequencing, Mullighan et al. (2007) identified
mutations in genes encoding principal regulators of B-lymphocyte
development and differentiation in 40% of B-progenitor ALL cases.
Deletions were detected in IKZF1, IKZF3 (606221),TCF3 (147141), EBF1
(164343), and LEF1 (153245). The PAX5 (167414) gene was the most
frequent target of somatic mutation, being altered in 31.7% of cases.

The Philadelphia chromosome, a chromosomal abnormality that encodes
BCR-ABL1 (see 151410, 189980), is the defining lesion of chronic
myelogenous leukemia (CML) and a subset of acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(ALL). To define oncogenic lesions that cooperate with BCR-ABL1 to
induce ALL, Mullighan et al. (2008) performed a genomewide analysis of
diagnostic leukemia samples from 304 individuals with ALL, including 43
BCR-ABL1 B-progenitor ALLs and 23 CML cases. IKZF1, encoding the
transcription factor Ikaros, was deleted in 83.7% of BCR-ABL1 ALL, but
not in chronic phase CML. Deletion of IKZF1 was also identified as an
acquired lesion at the time of transformation of CML to ALL (lymphoid
blast crisis). The IKZF1 deletions resulted in haploinsufficiency,
expression of a dominant-negative Ikaros isoform, or the complete loss
of Ikaros expression. Sequencing of IKZF1 deletion breakpoints suggested
that aberrant RAG-mediated recombination (see 179615) is responsible for
the deletions. Mullighan et al. (2008) concluded that genetic lesions
resulting in the loss of Ikaros function are an important event in the
development of BCR-ABL1 ALL.

Mullighan et al. (2009) identified deletions involving the IKZF1 gene in
leukemic cells of 63 (28.6%) of 221 children with B-cell acute
lymphoblastic leukemia. Cells from 20 patients had a deletion of coding
exons 3 through 6, resulting in the expression of a dominant-negative
form of IKZF1. IKZF1 deletions were associated with an increased risk of
relapse and adverse effects in the original cohort and in an independent
cohort of 258 patients (p values ranging from less than 0.001 to 0.004).

For a discussion of a possible association between variation in the
IKZF1 gene and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, see ALL2 (613067).

CYTOGENETICS

The BCL6 gene (109565), isolated from the breakpoints of 3q27-associated
chromosomal translocations, is implicated in diffuse large B-cell
lymphomas (DLBL). Hosokawa et al. (2000) described the molecular
characterization of novel t(3;7)(q27;p12) translocations in 2 patients
with DLBL. Molecular genetic analysis of the breakpoint area involving
BCL6 revealed the presence of the Ikaros gene. As a molecular
consequence of the translocation, the 5-prime regulatory region of BCL6
was replaced by the putative 5-prime regulatory region of the Ikaros
gene, probably leading to deregulated expression of the BCL6 gene
throughout B-cell differentiation. RT-PCR and FISH analyses of a patient
sample established that the translocation resulted in fusion of the
Ikaros and BCL6 genes. The clinical features of the 2 patients with DLBL
and t(3;7)(q27;p12) translocations were reported by Ichinohasama et al.
(1998).

ANIMAL MODEL

Mice homozygous for a germline mutation in the Ikaros DNA-binding domain
lack not only T and B lymphocytes and natural killer cells, but also
their earliest defined progenitors (Georgopoulos et al., 1994). In
contrast, the erythroid and myeloid lineages are intact in these mutant
mice. Klug et al. (1998) showed that the DNA-binding isoforms of mouse
Ikaros are localized in the nucleus of the most primitive hematopoietic
stem cell subset. They found that Ikaros localizes to heterochromatin in
Abelson-transformed pre-B lymphocytes. Changes in the RNA splicing
pattern of Ikaros occurred at 2 stages of lymphoid differentiation.

O'Neill et al. (1999, 2000) described the structure of a chromatin
remodeling complex associated with Ikaros that is present only in adult
hematopoietic cells. This complex binds to Ikaros-like DNA-binding
sites, including a long polypyrimidine-rich sequence upstream of the
human delta-globin gene (142000), and was thus called PYR complex.
Deletion of this sequence in a human beta locus-containing cosmid
(carrying sequences from the human gamma-A gene, 142200, through the
adult beta-globin gene, 141900) in transgenic mice resulted in delayed
switching from gamma-globin to beta-globin. Lopez et al. (2002) showed
that homozygous Ikaros-null mice lacked the PYR complex, demonstrating a
requirement for Ikaros in the formation of the complex on DNA.
Heterozygous Ikaros-null mice had about half as much PYR complex,
indicating a dosage effect for both Ikaros and PYR complex. They also
showed that Ikaros-null mice had multiple hematopoietic cell defects,
including anemia and megakaryocytic abnormalities, in addition to
lymphoid and stem cell defects. The null mice also had a delay in murine
embryonic-to-adult beta-globin switching and a delay in human
gamma-to-beta switching, consistent with the suggested role for PYR
complex in this process. Lastly, cDNA array analyses indicated that
several hematopoietic cell-specific genes in all blood lineages were
either up- or downregulated in 14-day embryos from Ikaros-null mice
compared with wildtype mice. These results indicated that Ikaros and PYR
complex function together in vivo at many adult hematopoietic
cell-specific genes and at intergenic sites, affecting their expression
and leading to pleiotropic hematopoietic defects.

Plasmacytoid dendritic cells are specialized dendritic cells that
produce high levels of type I interferon (see IFNA1; 147660) upon viral
infection. Allman et al. (2006) showed that mice expressing low levels
of Ikaros lacked peripheral plasmacytoid dendritic cells but not other
dendritic cell subsets. Loss of plasmacytoid dendritic cells was
associated with inability to produce type I interferon after challenge
with Tlr7 (300365) or Tlr9 (605474) ligands or murine cytomegalovirus.
Conventional dendritic cells were present in normal numbers and
exhibited normal responses to in vivo challenge with murine
cytomegalovirus or inactivated toxoplasma antigen.

608686	TITLE *608686 RAB3A-INTERACTING PROTEIN; RAB3IP
;;RABIN8;;
RABIN3, RAT, HOMOLOG OF; RABIN3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using SSX2 (300192) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a testis cDNA
library, de Bruijn et al. (2002) cloned RAB3IP. They identified 6
alternatively spliced RAB3IP transcripts, the longest of which encodes a
deduced 476-amino acid protein containing a central coiled-coil domain,
a bipartite nuclear localization signal, and a C-terminal endoplasmic
reticulum retention motif. RAB3IP has several sites for N-glycosylation
and phosphorylation. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.1-kb transcript
in brain, kidney, heart, placenta, and pancreas, but not in skeletal
muscle and liver. Transcripts of 3.8 and 10.2 kb were also detected in
brain and kidney. EST database analysis revealed that RAB3IP was also
expressed in retina, fetal thymus, and B-cell germinal centers. In vitro
transcription and translation of RAB3IP cDNA resulted in a protein that
migrated at an apparent molecular mass of 56 kD by SDS-PAGE.
Immunofluorescence analysis of transfected HeLa cells localized RAB32IP
in the cytoplasm; however, coexpression of RAB3IP with SSX2 led to
colocalization of both proteins in the nucleus.

GENE FUNCTION

By in vitro pull-down assays, de Bruijn et al. (2002) confirmed the
interaction between RAB3IP and SSX2. RAB3IP specifically interacted with
an N-terminal domain of SSX2, and it did not interact with SSX1
(312820), SSX3 (300325), or SSX4 (300326).

GENE STRUCTURE

De Bruijn et al. (2002) determined that the RAB3IP gene contains 12
exons and spans almost 77 kb. The 5-prime end lacks canonical CAAT and
TATA boxes, but has a high GC content, characteristics of a housekeeping
gene.

MAPPING

By FISH, de Bruijn et al. (2002) mapped the RAB3IP gene to chromosome
12q13-q14.

614218	TITLE *614218 WD REPEAT-CONTAINING PROTEIN 81; WDR81
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Okazaki et al. (2004) cloned mouse Wdr81, which they designated
FLJ00182. The deduced protein contains 693 amino acids.

Gulsuner et al. (2011) stated that the longest isoform of the human
WDR81 gene, isoform 1, contains 1,941 amino acids. The protein contains
an N-terminal BEACH (Beige and Chediak-Higashi) domain, a MFS (major
facilitator superfamily) domain, and 6 C-terminal WD40 repeats. The
protein is predicted to be a transmembrane protein with 6
membrane-spanning domains. Human WDR81 was expressed in all brain
regions analyzed, with highest levels of expression in the cerebellum
and corpus callosum. Wdr81 was detected in Purkinje cells in the
cerebellum of mouse embryos, and was coexpressed with genes involved in
neuronal differentiation and projection, axonogenesis, and cell
morphogenesis, suggesting a role in development.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gulsuner et al. (2011) stated that the human WDR81 gene contains 10
exons.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the WDR81 gene to chromosome 17p13.3 based on an
alignment of the WDR81 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK091136) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

Okazaki et al. (2004) mapped the mouse Wdr81 gene to chromosome 11.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of a consanguineous Turkish family with autosomal
recessive cerebellar ataxia, mental retardation, and dysequilibrium
syndrome-2 (CAMRQ2; 610185), Gulsuner et al. (2011) identified a
homozygous mutation in the WDR81 gene (P856L; 614218.0001). Homozygosity
for the mutation segregated with the phenotype. The mutation occurred in
a highly conserved residue and was not found in 549 controls. The
mutation was found by targeted sequencing of the candidate disease
region identified by linkage analysis. The family had originally been
reported by Turkmen et al. (2006) as having cerebellar hypoplasia,
mental retardation, and an inability to walk bipedally, resulting in
quadrupedal locomotion as a functional adaptation. Brain MRI of affected
individuals by Gulsuner et al. (2011) showed morphologic abnormalities
in the cerebellum and corpus callosum, in particular atrophy of
superior, middle, and inferior peduncles of the cerebellum. Structural
MRI showed additional morphometric abnormalities in several cortical
areas, including the corpus callosum, precentral gyrus, and several
Brodmann areas.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CEREBELLAR ATAXIA, MENTAL RETARDATION, AND DYSEQUILIBRIUM SYNDROME

WDR81, PRO856LEU

In affected members of a consanguineous Turkish family with autosomal
recessive cerebellar ataxia, mental retardation, and dysequilibrium
syndrome-2 (CAMRQ2; 610185) (Turkmen et al., 2006), Gulsuner et al.
(2011) identified a homozygous C-to-T transition at cDNA position 2567
(2567C-T) in exon 1 of the WDR81 gene, resulting in a pro856-to-leu
(P856L) substitution in a highly conserved residue in the MFS domain of
isoform 1. The mutation was not found in 549 controls.
