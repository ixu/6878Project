DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that recruit an Argonaute (AGO)
protein complex to a complementary target mRNA, which results in
translation repression or degradation of the mRNA. The MIR369 precursor
stem-loop sequence encodes 2 mature miRNAs, MIR369-5p and MIR369-3p,
from its 5-prime and 3-prime ends, respectively (Altuvia et al., 2005;
Vasudevan et al., 2007).

CLONING

By database and sequence analysis, Altuvia et al. (2005) identified
MIR369-5p and MIR369-3p, which lie on the 5-prime and 3-prime ends,
respectively, of the MIR369 precursor stem-loop structure. They cloned
MIR369-5p and MIR369-3p from a pituitary gland cDNA library.

Vasudevan et al. (2007) identified MIR369-3p, which they called
MIR369-3, as a microRNA with a seed region complementary to the AU-rich
element (ARE) of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFA; 191160). The mature
MIR369-3p sequence is AAUAAUACAUGGUUGAUCUUU.

GENE FUNCTION

AU-rich elements (AREs) and microRNA target sites are conserved
sequences in mRNA 3-prime UTRs that control gene expression
posttranscriptionally. Upon cell cycle arrest, the ARE in tumor necrosis
factor-alpha (TNFA; 191160) mRNA is transformed into a translation
activation signal, recruiting Argonaute (AGO; see 606228) and fragile X
mental retardation-related protein-1 (FXR1; 600819), factors associated
with microribonucleoproteins (microRNPs). Vasudevan et al. (2007) showed
that human MIR369-3p directs association of these proteins with the AREs
to activate translation. Furthermore, Vasudevan et al. (2007) documented
that 2 well-studied microRNAs, Let7 (see 605386) and the synthetic
microRNA miRcxcr4, likewise induced translation upregulation of target
mRNAs on cell cycle arrest, yet they repressed translation in
proliferating cells. Thus, Vasudevan et al. (2007) concluded that
activation is a common function of microRNPs on cell cycle arrest. They
proposed that translation regulation by microRNPs oscillates between
repression and activation during the cell cycle.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Altuvia et al. (2005) mapped the MIR369
gene within a miRNA cluster on chromosome 14 that includes MIR409
(614057).

Gross (2011) mapped the MIR369 gene to chromosome 14q32.31 based on an
alignment of the MIR369 stem-loop sequence
(UUGAAGGGAGAUCGACCGUGUUAUAUUCGCUUUAUUGACUUCGAAUAAUACAUGGUUGAUCUUUUCUCAG)
with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

610566	TITLE *610566 MICRO RNA 146A; MIR146A
;;miRNA146A;;
MIRN146A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), such as MIRN146A, are an evolutionarily conserved
class of endogenous 22-nucleotide noncoding RNAs involved in
posttranscriptional gene repression. In animals, miRNAs are processed
from long primary transcripts through a 60-bp hairpin precursor step
into mature forms by sequential cutting with 2 RNase III enzymes, Drosha
(RNASEN; 608828) and Dicer (606241). Mature miRNAs are then loaded onto
the ribonucleoprotein complex dubbed RISC (RNA-induced silencing
complex), where they guide recognition and translational repression or
degradation of target mRNAs (summary by Taganov et al., 2006).

CLONING

Taganov et al. (2006) stated that the human genome contains 2 miRNA146
genes, MIRN146A and MIRN146B (610567), on chromosomes 5 and 10,
respectively. They determined that MIRN146A is located within exon 2 of
the LOC285628 gene. The primary LOC285628 transcript contains no
significant ORF, suggesting it belongs to a class of noncoding RNAs.
Using RACE, Taganov et al. (2006) found that the MIRN146A primary
transcript contains 2,337 bp. The mature products of MIRN146A and
MIRN146B differ by only 2 nucleotides in the 3-prime region.

Using quantitative real-time PCR, Sonkoly et al. (2007) found ubiquitous
but variable miR146A expression in human tissues. In skin, miR146A was
preferentially expressed in immune cells, with highest level in CD4
(186940)-positive/CD25 (IL2RA; 147730)-positive T cells, but was absent
from keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts.

GENE FUNCTION

By expression profiling, Taganov et al. (2006) found that the mature
forms of MIRN132 (610016), MIRN155 (609337), MIRN146A, and MIRN146B were
induced in a monocyte cell line following exposure to lipopolysaccharide
(LPS). Promoter analysis of MIRN146A revealed that transcription
following LPS, TNF (191160), or IL1B (147720) exposure was dependent on
NFKB (see 164011). Luciferase reporter analysis suggested that sequences
in the 3-prime UTRs of TRAF6 (602355) and IRAK1 (300283) may basepair
with MIRN146A and MIRN146B. Taganov et al. (2006) proposed that MIRN146A
and MIRN146B may function as negative regulators of Toll-like receptors
and cytokine signaling by downregulating IRAK1 and TRAF6 protein levels.

Using microarray analysis and quantitative real-time PCR, Sonkoly et al.
(2007) found that expression of miR146A was upregulated in psoriasis
(see 177900), but not in atopic eczema (see 603165), compared with
normal human skin.

Using microarray and Northern blot analysis, Chang et al. (2008) showed
that MIRN146A was among several miRNAs downregulated by MYC (190080) in
mouse and human B-cell lymphoma cell lines. MYC bound the MIRN146A
upstream region.

Using DNA arrays and Northern blot analysis, Lukiw et al. (2008) found
that the expression of MIR146A was significantly upregulated in
Alzheimer disease (AD; 104300) neocortex and hippocampus compared with
normal control tissue. They identified a putative MIR146A-binding site
in the 3-prime UTR of CFH (134370), and confirmed that the expression of
CFH was downregulated in AD brain compared with controls. Upregulation
of MIR146A and downregulation of CFH was also found in stressed primary
human neuronal/glial cell cocultures, which is a model of AD. They
further found that MIR146A was upregulated by NF-kappa-B (see 164011)
and concluded that NF-kappa-B-sensitive MIR146A modulates the expression
of CFH as part of the inflammatory response in AD brain.

One of the most common subtypes of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), 5q-
syndrome (153550), is characterized by an isolated interstitial deletion
of chromosome 5q, severe anemia, variable neutropenia, and normal or
high platelet counts with dysplastic megakaryocytes. Starczynowski et
al. (2010) postulated that loss of miRNAs encoded within the common
deleted region in 5q- syndrome may result in haploinsufficiency due to
loss of inhibition of their targets. They found that expression of
MIR145 (611795) and MIR146A was reduced in MDS patients with deletion of
chromosome 5q. Loss of both MIR145 and MIR146A resulted in activation of
innate immune signaling due to elevated expression of their respective
targets, TIRAP (606252) and TRAF6. Knockdown of both Mir145 and Mir146a
or overexpression of Traf6 in mouse hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells
(HSPCs) recapitulated several features of 5q- syndrome, including
thrombocytosis, mild neutropenia, and megakaryocytic dysplasia.
Starczynowski et al. (2010) concluded that inappropriate activation of
innate immune signals in HSPCs due to loss of miRNA-mediated inhibition
is involved in several features of 5q- syndrome.

Using RT-PCR analysis, Curtale et al. (2010) found that expression of
MIR146A was low in human naive T cells, but that it was abundant in
memory T cells, with induction initiated by T-cell receptor (TCR; see
186880) stimulation. Binding sites for NF-kappa-B and ETS (see 164720)
in the MIR146A promoter were required for induction of MIR146A
transcription upon TCR engagement. MIR146A modulated activation-induced
cell death by acting as an antiapoptotic factor, and it targeted FADD
(602457). AP1 (165160) activity and IL2 (147680) production were
impaired by MIR146A expression. Curtale et al. (2010) concluded that
several signaling pathways other than inflammation are influenced by
MIR146A.

Using mice lacking Tlr4 (603030) or the essential TLR signaling molecule
Irak1, Chassin et al. (2010) demonstrated that Mir146a mediated
translational repression and proteolytic degradation of Irak1, which was
sufficient to induce intestinal epithelial innate immune tolerance and
provide protection from bacteria-induced epithelial damage in neonates.
Intraepithelial endotoxin persistence during the neonatal period
maintained tolerance through sustained Mir146a expression and
additionally facilitated transcription of a distinct set of genes
involved in cell survival, differentiation, and homeostasis. Chassin et
al. (2010) concluded that neonatal intestinal epithelial innate immune
tolerance is an example of restriction of signaling to prevent
bacteria-induced intestinal epithelial damage during the transition
between fetal, neonatal, and adult life.

MAPPING

Taganov et al. (2006) stated that the MIRN146A gene maps to chromosome
5.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Jazdzewski et al. (2008) found that the rarer C allele of a common G/C
SNP (dbSNP rs2910164) within the pre-miR-146a sequence reduced the
amount of pre- and mature miR146A 1.9- and 1.8-fold, respectively,
compared with the G allele. The SNP is located on the passenger strand
of pre-miR146A, at position +60 relative to the first nucleotide, and
the C allele is predicted to cause mispairing within the hairpin. EMSA
experiments showed that the C allele interfered with binding of HeLa
cell nuclear proteins to pre-miR146a, and it also caused inefficient
inhibition of the miR146a target genes TRAF6 and IRAK1, as well as of
PTC1 (CCDC6; 601985), in reporter gene assays. Jazdzewski et al. (2008)
genotyped 608 patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC; 188550)
and 901 controls and found that GC heterozygosity was associated with
increased risk of acquiring PTC, whereas both homozygous states were
protective. They concluded that the G/C SNP alters pre-miR146a
processing and contributes to predisposition to PTC by altering
expression of miR146a target genes in the Toll-like receptor and
cytokine signaling pathway.

610106	TITLE *610106 DREBRIN-LIKE; DBNL
;;HPK1-INTERACTING PROTEIN, 55-KD; HIP55
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of a HeLa cell cDNA library using GLK
(MAP4K3; 604921) as bait, followed by EST database analysis, Ensenat et
al. (1999) cloned DBNL, which they called HIP55. The predicted 430-amino
acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 48 kD. The N terminus of
HIP55 contains a putative actin-binding domain found in drebrins (see
DBN1; 126660), which are involved in brain development, and the C
terminus contains an SH3 domain. Western blot analysis detected a 55-kD
protein. Northern blot analysis revealed ubiquitous expression of a
2.3-kb transcript, with highest levels in spleen and peripheral blood
leukocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Ensenat et al. (1999) found that HIP55
interacted with GLK and HPK1 (MAP4K1; 601983). They confirmed the
interaction with HPK1 both in vitro and in vivo. The interaction was
dependent on the SH3 domain of HIP55 and the second proline-rich domain
of HPK1. When cotransfected, HIP55 increased HPK1 kinase activity and
JNK1 (MAPK8; 601158) kinase activity. Ensenat et al. (1999) concluded
that HIP55 binds HPK1 and regulates the JNK1 signaling cascade.

Using confocal microscopy, RNA interference, and overexpression
experiments in mouse and human cell lines, Le Bras et al. (2004) found
that HIP55 did not contribute to early formation of T
cell-antigen-presenting cell (APC) conjugates. However, they identified
HIP55 as a key constituent of the immunologic synapse, regulating T-cell
activation by bridging T-cell receptors and the actin cytoskeleton to
gene activation and endocytic processes.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the DBNL
gene to chromosome 7 (TMAP D7S2634).

ANIMAL MODEL

Han et al. (2005) found that Hip55 -/- mice were viable and fertile, but
they showed decreased body weight and increased frequency of death
within the first 4 weeks after birth. Lymphoid organs of Hip55 -/- mice
showed normal cellularity and T-cell development. However, Hip55 -/- T
cells proliferated at a reduced level, with lower cytokine production
and lower expression of activation markers after T-cell receptor
stimulation.
