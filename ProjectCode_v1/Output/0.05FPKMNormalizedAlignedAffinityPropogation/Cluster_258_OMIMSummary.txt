MITOCHONDRIAL THRRS
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases for aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases containing a
mitochondrial targeting sequence, Bonnefond et al. (2005) identified
TARS2, which the called mitochondrial THRRS. The deduced 718-amino acid
protein has an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal with a
predicted cleavage site after residue 39. TARS2 has characteristics of a
class II mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase and is expected to
function as a dimer.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bonnefond et al. (2005) determined that the TARS2 gene contains 18 exons
and spans 19.6 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Bonnefond et al. (2005) mapped the TARS2
gene to chromosome 1.

609367	TITLE *609367 KIAA1279 GENE; KIAA1279
;;KINESIN-BINDING PROTEIN; KBP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned KIAA1279. The deduced protein
contains 632 amino acids. RT-PCR detected high expression in heart,
brain, ovary, testis, spinal cord, and all specific brain regions
examined. Moderate expression was detected in all other adult tissues
examined, as well as in fetal liver and brain.

Brooks et al. (2005) reported that the KIAA1279 gene encodes a 621-amino
acid protein that shares 89% sequence homology with the mouse homolog.
The predicted protein contains 2 tetratricopeptide repeats. Northern
blot analysis of adult and fetal tissues detected expression of a 2.4-kb
transcript in all tissues except blood leukocytes. The transcript was
present in different parts of the adult central nervous system,
including cerebellum, cortex, medulla, spinal cord, occipital lobe,
frontal lobe, temporal lobe, and putamen.

By in situ hybridization of zebrafish embryos, Alves et al. (2010) found
that Kbp was ubiquitously and diffusely expressed in early development
and later became enriched in the central and enteric nervous systems.
Fluorescence-tagged Kbp was expressed in the cytoplasm of transfected
N1E-115 mouse neuroblastoma cells, with enrichment at the Golgi
apparatus.

GENE STRUCTURE

Brooks et al. (2005) stated that the KIAA1279 gene contains 7 exons
spanning 28 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1999) mapped the KIAA1279
gene to chromosome 10.

Gross (2012) mapped the KIAA1279 gene to chromosome 10q22.1 based on an
alignment of the KIAA1279 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC012180) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of an embryonic mouse cDNA library, Alves et
al. (2010) found that Kbp interacted with the microtubule-destabilizing
protein Scg10 (STMN2; 600621), with tubulin alpha-7 (Tuba3b), and with
the kinesins Kif5b (602809), Kif5c (604593), Kif7 (611254), Kif2c
(604538), Kif3a (604683), and Kifc1 (603763). Sequencing revealed that
Kbp interacted with kinesin motor domains. Coimmunoprecipitation
analysis of transfected HEK293 cells and colocalization of Kbp and Scg10
in N1E-115 cells confirmed the interaction between Kbp and Scg10. Kbp
did not appear to interact directly with microtubules. Knockdown of Kbp
expression in rat PC12 cells inhibited NGF-beta (NGFB; 162030)-induced
neurite outgrowth. Alves et al. (2010) concluded that KBP has an
indirect role in regulating microtubule dynamics and neurite outgrowth
via its interaction with SCG10.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using homozygosity mapping in a large consanguineous Moroccan family
with Goldberg-Shprintzen megacolon syndrome (GOSHS; 609460), which is
characterized by microcephaly, mental retardation, facial dysmorphism,
and Hirschsprung disease, Brooks et al. (2005) mapped the disorder to
chromosome 10q21.3-q22.1. In affected members of this family, they
identified homozygosity for an arg90-to-ter mutation (609367.0001) in
the KIAA1279 gene. All patients in this family had bilateral generalized
polymicrogyria in addition to Hirschsprung disease, thus establishing
the importance of KIAA1279 in both enteric and central nervous system
development. In 4 affected members of a consanguineous British Pakistani
family, Brooks et al. (2005) identified homozygosity for a glu84-to-ter
mutation (609367.0002) in the KIAA1279 gene.

611856	TITLE *611856 MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN L52; MRPL52
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mitochondria have their own translation system for production of 13
inner membrane proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation. MRPL52
is a component of the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome that
is encoded by the nuclear genome (Koc et al., 2001).

CLONING

By searching databases using bovine Mrpl52 as query, Koc et al. (2001)
identified human MRPL52. They also identified MRPL52 homologs in mouse,
Drosophila, and C. elegans, but not in yeast, E. coli, or Arabidopsis.
Mouse and human MRPL52 share 85.1% amino acid identity.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the MRPL52
gene to chromosome 14 (TMAP RH103319).

612895	TITLE *612895 NUCLEOREDOXIN; NXN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Kurooka et al. (1997) cloned mouse nucleoredoxin from a neonatal skin
cDNA library. The deduced 435-amino acid protein is rich in acidic amino
acids, has an internal long direct repeat, and shares significant
similarity with thioredoxin (TXN; 187700). Northern blot analysis
detected several nucleoredoxin splice variants in adult mouse tissues,
with highest expression in testis and skin and lowest expression in
liver. In situ hybridization showed that expression of nucleoredoxin
varied during mouse embryonic development. Expression was widespread in
embryos at days 9.5 and 10.5, with expression in limb buds, somites,
dorsal root ganglia, branchial bars, and parts of the brain, but
expression was marginal at day 12.5. Epitope-tagged nucleoredoxin
localized to nuclei of transfected COS-7 cells. Southern blot analysis
detected nucleoredoxin orthologs in human, rat, and rabbit, but not in
frog, fly, nematode, and yeast.

GENE FUNCTION

Kurooka et al. (1997) showed that the recombinant C-terminal domain of
mouse nucleoredoxin had oxidoreductase activity toward the disulfide
bonds of insulin (INS; 176730), with kinetics similar to that of
purified E. coli thioredoxin. Deletion of 55 N-terminal amino acids from
the construct, including the putative redox active site, resulted in a
protein that failed to reduce insulin.

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the NXN gene to chromosome 17p13.3 based on an
alignment of the NXN sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF086523) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

Kurooka et al. (1997) mapped the mouse Nxn gene to chromosome 11.

;;TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR-LIKE 1; TCFL1;;
TRANSFORMATION SUPPRESSOR GENE YL-1; YL1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Horikawa et al. (1995) followed up on previous observations that various
transformed phenotypes of Kirsten sarcoma virus-transformed NIH 3T3
cells were suppressed by introduction of a normal human chromosome 1 via
microcell fusion and that revertant cells that re-acquired the
transformed phenotype commonly lost the human 1q21 and 1q23-q24 regions.
The observations had suggested the location of a transformation
suppressor gene(s) on the proximal portion of 1q. Horikawa et al. (1995)
isolated a novel human cDNA on 1q21, designated YL1, as a candidate, and
then cloned its mouse homolog. Human and mouse YL1 cDNA shared 96% amino
acid homology and presumably encoded a transcription factor-like
polypeptide. An analysis using a specific antibody demonstrated nuclear
localization of YL1 protein. The bacterially expressed YL1 could bind to
DNA. Thus, the YL1 protein possibly functions as a transcriptional
regulator.

Cai et al. (2005) stated that the YL1 protein contains 364 amino acids
and that it is highly conserved from humans to yeast.

GENE STRUCTURE

Cox et al. (2001) determined that the YL1 gene contains 6 coding exons
spanning 14.2 kb and intergenically splices into TMOD4 (605834). The
last exon of YL1 is 291 bp from a 5-prime untranslated exon of TMOD4.
Cox et al. (2001) also found that YL1 undergoes unconventional splicing
using noncanonical splice sites within exons to produce several
alternative transcripts.

MAPPING

Horikawa et al. (1995) identified the YL1 gene on chromosome 1q21.

GENE FUNCTION

Cai et al. (2005) demonstrated that epitope-tagged YL1 associated with
proteins of the TRRAP (603015)/TIP60 (HTATIP; 601409) histone
acetyltransferase complex in transfected HeLa cells. In addition, YL1
was part of a subset of proteins that also functioned as subunits of the
SWI2/SNF2 (SMARCA2; 600014)-related CBP (CREBBP; 600140) activator
protein (SRCAP) chromatin remodeling complex.

615036	TITLE *615036 MICRO RNA 410; MIR410
;;miRNA410
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Micro RNAs (miRNAs), such as MIR410, are small noncoding RNAs that
downregulate gene expression by promoting mRNA degradation or preventing
mRNA translation via sequence-specific interactions with target RNAs
(Gattolliat et al., 2011).

GENE FUNCTION

A combination of age at diagnosis, stage of disease, and amplification
of the MYCN gene (164840) define high- and low-risk neuroblastomas (see
256700). Using microarray expression profiling and quantitative RT-PCR,
Gattolliat et al. (2011) found that 15 of 17 miRNAs significantly
downregulated in high-risk neuroblastomas originated from a large miRNA
cluster on chromosome 14q. Of these, MIR410 and MIR487B (615037)
exhibited the highest fold change and discriminated high-risk from
low-risk neuroblastomas. Compared with high-risk neuroblastomas,
low-risk neuroblastomas showed expression of both MIR410 and MIR487B,
and MIR410 and MIR487B expression favored overall and disease-free
survival. No loss of copy number at this locus was found in high-risk
neuroblastomas, suggesting that downregulation of these miRNAs was
likely the result of transcriptional or processing regulation.

Richardson et al. (2013) found that MIR410 is a regulator of lipoprotein
lipase (LPL; 609708) and that the minor allele C of the SNP dbSNP
rs13702 in LPL (609708.0043) abolishes the response of a functional
MIR410 recognition element in the LPL 3-prime untranslated region.

MAPPING

Gattolliat et al. (2011) stated that the MIR410 gene maps to a large
miRNA cluster on chromosome 14q32.31.
