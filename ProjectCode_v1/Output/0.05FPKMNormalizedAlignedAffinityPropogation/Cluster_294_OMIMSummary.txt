615242	TITLE *615242 SMALL INTEGRAL MEMBRANE PROTEIN 1; SMIM1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using microarrays for SNP profiling of 20 individuals with the
Vel-negative blood group phenotype, followed by transcriptional network
modeling, Storry et al. (2013) identified SMIM1 as a candidate for the
gene underlying Vel antigen expression. By 5-prime and 3-prime RACE of
Vel-positive blood mRNA, they cloned SMIM1. The deduced 78-amino acid
protein has a calculated molecular mass of about 8.7 kD. SMIM1 was
predicted to be a type I transmembrane protein with an approximately
50-amino acid extracellular domain containing several potential sites
for O-glycosylation. The transmembrane domain contains a potential GxxxG
helix-helix dimerization motif. Analysis of human microarray profiles
revealed highest SMIM1 expression in CD34 (142230)-positive erythroid
cultures and in bone marrow, followed by salivary gland and testis. Much
lower expression was detected in several other tissues, including brain.
Western blot analysis of Vel-positive blood and glycophorin A (GPA;
111300)-positive bone marrow detected SMIM1 as a monomer with an
apparent molecular mass of 9 to 10 kD and as reduction-resistant
homodimers of about 20 kD, consistent with the presence of the
transmembrane dimerization motif. Orthologs of SMIM1 were detected in 45
other species from primates to sea squirt. Flow cytometry detected cell
surface expression of SMIM1 in transfected K562 erythroleukemia cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Storry et al. (2013) determined that the SMIM1 gene contains 4 exons.
Exons 1 and 2 are noncoding, and intron 2 contains a GATA motif
conserved in primates and rodents, but not in dog, bovine, or elephant.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Storry et al. (2013) mapped the SMIM1 gene
to chromosome 1p36.

GENE FUNCTION

Ballif et al. (2013) identified SMIM1 as the Vel antigen on red blood
cells. A purified anti-Vel antibody detected a band of about 32 kD in
red blood cell membranes extracted from Vel-positive individuals.
Electrophoresis studies showed that the Vel antigen migrated at about 18
kD under reducing conditions, suggesting that it forms a molecular
homodimer via disulfide bonds. Mass spectrometry, peptide sequencing,
and BLAST analysis suggested that the SMIM1 encodes the Vel antigen.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Vel Blood Group System

By SNP mapping followed by candidate gene sequencing of 20 individuals
with the Vel-negative blood group phenotype (615264), Storry et al.
(2013) identified a homozygous 17-bp deletion in the SMIM1 gene
(615242.0001) in all individuals. The findings were confirmed in 15
additional Vel-negative individuals, predominantly of European descent.
Direct genotyping identified 30 heterozygous deletion carriers among 520
Swedish blood donors. The deletion was not found in the 1000 Genomes
Project data, but was found in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood
Institute (NHLBI) Exome Sequencing Project (ESP) database: in 57 of
5,763 European Americans and 6 of 3,198 in African Americans, yielding
heterozygote frequencies of about 1 in 50 and 1 in 267, respectively.

By exome sequencing of 5 individuals negative for the Vel antigen,
Cvejic et al. (2013) found that 4 were homozygous and 1 was heterozygous
for a 17-bp frameshift deletion in the SMIM1 gene. Combined with a
follow-up study of additional Vel-negative individuals, a total of 63 of
69 Vel-negative individuals were found to be homozygous for the
deletion. Five individuals classified as Vel-negative were heterozygous
for the deletion and 1 was heterozygous for a missense mutation (M51R)
only. Heterozygosity for the null allele in these individuals was most
likely explained by misclassification of extremely weak Vel expression
as Vel-negative. In addition, 19 of 20 individuals with weak Vel
expression were heterozygous for the deletion. One individual with weak
expression was heterozygous for a missense mutation (M51K). The 2
missense mutations may lead to inability of the SMIM1 protein to
incorporate in the membrane, or may modify the epitope, leading to
decreased binding of the antibody. Functional studies were not performed
on the M51R or M51K variants. Expression of the Vel antigen on
SMIM1-transfected HEK293T cells confirmed that SMIM1 is the gene
underlying the Vel blood group. All 24 Vel-negative individuals or those
with weak Vel expression who were heterozygous for the deletion were
homozygous for the major A allele of SNP dbSNP rs1175550, which is
present in intron 2 of the STIM1 gene and is associated with decreased
SMIM1 transcript levels. The findings suggested that this SNP
contributes to variable expression of the Vel antigen.

Ballif et al. (2013) also found that all 4 Vel-negative individuals
studied carried the same homozygous 17-bp deletion in exon 3 of the
SMIM1 gene. Subsequent screening identified the homozygous 17-bp
deletion in 68 of 70 Vel-negative individuals. Two individuals carried
the 17-bp deletion in the heterozygous state, and 1 was confirmed to
have weak Vel-positivity. The other was an elderly individual who may
have no longer expressed even weak antigen. In addition, 7 of 9
individuals with weak Vel-positivity were found to be heterozygous for
the deletion. Exogenous expression of SMIM1 in erythroleukemia cells
resulted in Vel expression at the cell surface, confirming that SMIM1
encodes the Vel antigen.

- Other Associations

Cvejic et al. (2013) found that the major A allele of SNP dbSNP
rs1175550 in the SMIM1 gene, which is associated with lower expression
of SMIM1, was associated with decreased mean hemoglobin concentration in
red blood cells (p = 8.6 x 10(-15)) and nominally associated with
correlated parameters, such as mean red blood cell volume and count.
These findings suggested a possible biologic role for SMIM1.

ANIMAL MODEL

Cvejic et al. (2013) found that morpholino-mediated knockdown of Smim1
caused a mild reduction in the total number of mature primitive
erythrocytes in zebrafish.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
VEL BLOOD GROUP SYSTEM, VEL-NULL PHENOTYPE
SMIM1, 17-BP DEL, NT64

In 20 individuals with the Vel-negative blood group phenotype (615264),
mostly of Swedish origin, Storry et al. (2013) identified a homozygous
17-bp deletion (64_80del17) in exon 3 of the SMIM1 gene, resulting in a
frameshift at residue ser22 and premature termination 5-prime to the
encoded transmembrane domain. The mutation was found by SNP mapping
followed by candidate gene sequencing. The findings were confirmed in 15
additional Vel-negative individuals, mostly of European origin.
Haplotype analysis indicated a founder effect. Genotype screening
estimated that about 1 in 17 Swedish blood donors is a heterozygous
deletion carrier and 1 in 1,200 is a homozygous deletion knockout. Blood
from a Vel-negative individual showed no capped and polyadenylated SMIM1
mRNA, suggesting that it is subject to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and
consistent with a null allele. The phenotype is significant in that
antibodies to Vel are associated with severe hemolytic transfusion
reactions.

Cvejic et al. (2013) and Ballif et al. (2013) independently and
simultaneously identified the homozygous 17-bp deletion in the SMIM1
gene as the genetic basis for the Vel-negative blood group.
Heterozygosity for the deletion was associated with weak Vel expression,
consistent with a dosage effect. A common origin for the deletion was
apparent.

610781	TITLE *610781 GUANOSINE MONOPHOSPHATE REDUCTASE 2; GMPR2
;;GMP REDUCTASE 2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database searching with the sequence of GMPR1 (GMPR; 139265) as
query, Deng et al. (2002) identified and subsequently cloned GMPR2 from
a human fetal brain cDNA library. The deduced 348-amino acid protein has
a calculated molecular mass of 37.9 kD and shares 90% sequence identity
with GMPR1 and 69% identity with E. coli GMPR. Northern blot analysis
detected relatively high levels of both GMPR1 and GMPR2 in heart,
skeletal muscle, and kidney, and relatively low levels of both in colon,
thymus, and peripheral blood leukocyte. Strong signals of GMPR2 were
detected in brain, liver, and placenta, whereas weak signals of GMPR1
were observed in these tissues. The apparent Km of GMPR2 for NADPH and
GMP are 26.6 and 17.4 microM, respectively.

Zhang et al. (2003) cloned GMPR2 from a human dendritic cell cDNA
library. Northern blot analysis detected ubiquitous expression of an
approximately 2.2-kb transcript, with high expression in testis, ovary,
prostate, heart, liver, spleen, skeletal muscle, and kidney. An
additional transcript of about 1.3 kb was detected in placenta.
Expression was also detected in most cancer cell lines studied.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhang et al. (2003) showed that recombinant GMPR2 protein was able to
reduce GMP. Transfection experiments demonstrated that overexpression of
GMPR2 promoted the monocytic differentiation of HL-60 leukemia cells.

EVOLUTION

Deng et al. (2002) presented evidence that the 2 types of GMP reductase
are derived from duplication of an ancient gene.

GENE STRUCTURE

Deng et al. (2002) determined that the GMPR2 gene contains 10 exons and
spans more than 6.6 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Deng et al. (2002) mapped the GMPR2 gene
to chromosome 14p11.2-p11.1. By the same method, Zhang et al. (2003)
mapped the gene to chromosome 14q11-q21.

612454	TITLE *612454 MULTIPLE EPIDERMAL GROWTH FACTOR-LIKE DOMAINS 11; MEGF11
;;KIAA1781
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2001) obtained a partial MEGF11 clone, which
they called KIAA1781. The transcript contains a repetitive element in
its 3-prime end, and the deduced protein contains over 970 amino acids.
MEGF11 has 17 EGF (131530)-like repeats and a transmembrane domain, and
it shares significant similarity with rat Megf6 (604266) and human
MEGF10 (612453). RT-PCR ELISA detected high expression in adult and
fetal brain and adult spinal cord, moderate expression in adult kidney
and ovary, low expression in heart, and little to no expression in other
tissues examined. MEGF11 was expressed in all adult brain regions
examined, with the highest level in cerebellum.

By examining mouse and human sequence databases, followed by RT-PCR of
human brain mRNA, Suzuki and Nakayama (2007) cloned full-length MEGF11.
The deduced 1,044-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal signal
sequence, followed by an emilin (see 130660)-like domain, 17 EGF-like
repeats, a transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal YxxL motif.

GENE FUNCTION

Suzuki and Nakayama (2007) found that fluorescence-tagged MEGF11 was
expressed in an irregular, mosaic-like pattern in transfected HEK293
cells, similar to that observed with MEGF10. However, unlike MEGF10,
MEGF11 localized to lamellipodia in addition to the basal membrane of
transfected cells.

Kay et al. (2012) demonstrated in mouse that 2 related transmembrane
proteins, MEGF10 and MEGF11, have critical roles in the formation of
mosaics by 2 retinal interneuron subtypes, starburst amacrine cells and
horizontal cells. MEGF10 and MEGF11 and their invertebrate relatives C.
elegans CED1 and Drosophila Draper had hitherto been studied primarily
as receptors necessary for engulfment of debris following apoptosis or
axonal injury. Kay et al. (2012) argued that their results demonstrated
that members of this gene family can also serve as subtype-specific
ligands that pattern neuronal arrays.

MAPPING

Hartz (2008) mapped the MEGF11 gene to chromosome 15q22.31 based on an
alignment of the MEGF11 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB058677) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

MYOMEGALIN-LIKE PROTEIN; MMGL;;
KIAA0454;;
KIAA0477
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen to identify proteins that interact with
rat Pde4d (600129), Verde et al. (2001) cloned rat Pde4dip, which they
called myomegalin. Rat myomegalin is a 2,324-amino acid protein composed
mostly of alpha-helical and coiled-coil structures. It contains domains
that share similarity with microtubule-associated proteins, as well as a
leucine zipper identical to that found in Drosophila centrosomin (see
602039). Northern blot analysis detected a 7.5- to 8.0-kb transcript in
most rat tissues examined; testis-, heart-, and skeletal muscle-specific
variants were also detected. Western blot analysis detected myomegalin
at about 62 kD in testis and at 230 to 250 kD in heart and skeletal
muscle. Immunocytochemistry and transfection studies demonstrated
colocalization of myomegalin with Pde4d in the Golgi/centrosomal area of
cultured cells and in sarcomeric structures of skeletal muscle.

By analyzing ESTs for cardiac muscle-specific transcripts, followed by
screening heart cDNA libraries and 5-prime RACE, Soejima et al. (2001)
cloned 4 splice variants of PDE4DIP, which they called MMGL. The
variant-1 transcript has a long 3-prime untranslated region containing 9
possible polyadenylation signals, and it encodes a deduced 174-amino
acid protein. Variants 2, 3, and 4 encode proteins of 174, 173, and 240
amino acids, respectively. Northern blot analysis detected high
expression of a 1.0- to 1.3-kb band and lower expression of 4.4- and
8.5-kb bands in adult and fetal heart, skeletal muscle, and all specific
heart regions examined. Only the 4.4-kb transcript was detected in
aorta. Fluorescence-tagged variants 1 and 4 were expressed in both the
cytoplasm and nucleus of transfected mouse myocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis and coimmunoprecipitation studies of
myomegalin expressed in COS-7 cells, Verde et al. (2001) found that rat
myomegalin associated with variant 3 of Pde4d and that they were
sequestered in particulate structures.

GENE STRUCTURE

Soejima et al. (2001) determined that the PDE4DIP gene contains 8 exons
and spans at least 70 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Soejima et al. (2001) mapped the PDE4DIP
gene to chromosome 1q1, but by FISH they mapped it to chromosomes 1q1
and 1p1. They determined that chromosome 1q1 is the correct location of
the PDE4DIP gene.

Wilkinson et al. (2003) reported the molecular cloning of a novel
translocation t(1;5)(q23;q33). They showed that it resulted in fusion of
the PDGFRB gene (173410) on 5q33 with the PDE4DIP gene, which by this
evidence is located on 1q23. They found that the translocation
t(1;5)(q23;q33) resulted in a myeloproliferative disorder associated
with eosinophilia.

E2-INDUCED GENE 4; E2IG4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

To identify genes that are regulated by or associated with estrogen
action, Charpentier et al. (2000) performed serial analysis of gene
expression (SAGE) on estrogen-responsive breast cancer cells after
exposure to estrogen. Using transcript-specific PCR primers for novel
sequences that increased more than 10-fold upon treatment with 17-beta
estradiol (E2), they cloned 5 cDNAs, designated E2-induced genes (E2IG)
1-5, from a human placenta cDNA library. The E2IG4 cDNA encodes a
deduced 353-amino acid protein containing a leucine-rich repeat in the N
terminus and 8 additional leucine-rich repeats. E2IG4 demonstrates
domain and structural homology to extracellular matrix leucine-rich
proteoglycans such as decorin (125255) and biglycan (301870). It also
contains various potential phosphorylation sites. Charpentier et al.
(2000) determined that E2IG4 is likely to reside in the cell membrane or
extracellular compartments and contains a typical cleavable signal
peptide.

GENE FUNCTION

Based on the structure and likely location of E2IG4, Charpentier et al.
(2000) suggested that the protein is involved in intracellular transport
and extracellular secretion.

Ohta et al. (2004) presented evidence that Tsk is a BMP (see 112264)
inhibitor in oviparous vertebrates that forms a ternary complex with Bmp
and chordin (603475) and is involved in the regulation of primitive
streak and Hensen node.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Charpentier et al. (2000) mapped the E2IG4 gene to
chromosome 11 between markers D11S911 and D11S4172.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I; EC 1.6.5.3) catalyzes the
first step in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, in which transfer of
electrons from NADH to ubiquinone (coenzyme Q) is accompanied by
translocation of protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane.
B17.2L, or mimitin, is a complex I assembly factor (Ogilvie et al.,
2005).

CLONING

By searching for genes upregulated by MYC (190080) in a human
glioblastoma cell line, followed by database analysis and 5-prime and
3-prime RACE of a human erythroid leukemia cell cDNA library, Tsuneoka
et al. (2005) cloned mimitin. The deduced 169-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 19.9 kD. Mimitin contains a central domain
found in the complex I B17.2 protein (NDUFA12; 614530) and a C-terminal
ATP/GTP-binding site motif A. Human and mouse mimitin share 80% amino
acid identity. Western blot analysis detected endogenous mimitin at an
apparent molecular mass of 20 kD. Immunolocalization and Western blot
analysis of fractionated cells confirmed that mimitin is a mitochondrial
protein.

By database analysis, Ogilvie et al. (2005) identified B17.2L, a paralog
of the B17.2 gene of the aerobic yeast Yarrowia lipolytica. Human B17.2L
shares 20% and 17% amino acid identity with yeast B17.2L and human
B17.2, respectively. Western blot analysis detected B17.2L expression in
human fibroblasts, heart, skeletal muscle, and liver.
Immunoprecipitation of B17.2L from normal human heart mitochondria
coimmunoprecipitated other complex I subunits. By transient transfection
of fluorescence-tagged B17.2L in human embryonic kidney cells, Ogilvie
et al. (2005) confirmed that B17.2L is targeted to mitochondria.

GENE FUNCTION

Tsuneoka et al. (2005) found that MYC induced mimitin expression in a
human glioblastoma cell line without necessarily stimulating cell
proliferation. Serum stimulation of starved cells increased MYC
expression, which was followed by increased mimitin expression.
Conversely, downregulation of MYC by phorbol esters was followed by
downregulation of mimitin expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation
analysis indicated that MYC bound an E box in the promoter region of the
mimitin gene during cell proliferation. Downregulation of mimitin
expression by small interfering RNA in a variety of human cancer cell
lines suppressed proliferation in a cell type-specific manner, with
greatest suppression in an esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC)
cell line. Tsuneoka et al. (2005) found that mimitin was highly
expressed in 28 (80%) of 35 primary ESCC tumors. Mimitin expression
correlated with MYC expression and cell proliferation, but not with
histopathologic grade, stage of cancer, or age of patients.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Tsuneoka et al. (2005) mapped the mimitin
gene to chromosome 5q12.1. Ogilvie et al. (2005) identified a pseudogene
on chromosome 2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a patient with mitochondrial complex I deficiency (252010), Ogilvie
et al. (2005) identified a homozygous mutation in the B17.2L gene
(609653.0001).

In a patient with mitochondrial complex I deficiency (252010), Ogilvie
et al. (2005) identified a homozygous 182C-T transition in exon 2 of the
B17.2L gene, resulting in an arg45-to-ter (R45X) substitution.
Transduction of the patient's fibroblasts with a retroviral vector
expressing the wildtype B17.2L cDNA resulted in complete rescue of the
biochemical defect. The patient presented with a severe childhood-onset
progressive encephalopathy leading to death at age 13 years. Complex I
activity was less than 20% control values.

In 2 sibs with mitochondrial complex I deficiency (252010) and Leigh
syndrome (256000), Calvo et al. (2010) identified a homozygous 1-bp
deletion (103delA) in the NDUFAF2 gene, resulting in a frameshift and
premature termination (Ile35SerfsTer17). Protein blot analysis did not
detect any NDUFAF2 protein, suggesting instability of the mutant protein
product.

603795	TITLE *603795 LIPOPOLYSACCHARIDE-INDUCED TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR-ALPHA FACTOR; LITAF
;;LPS-INDUCED TNF-ALPHA FACTOR;;
SMALL INTEGRAL MEMBRANE PROTEIN OF LYSOSOME/LATE ENDOSOME; SIMPLE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The LITAF gene encodes a transcription factor, first identified as a
regulator of TNF-alpha (TNF; 191160) gene expression (Takashiba et al.,
1995). The LITAF gene product is an early endosomal membrane protein
enriched in the peripheral nerves and Schwann cells (summary by Lee et
al., 2011).

CLONING

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a potent stimulator of monocytes and
macrophages, causing secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and other
inflammatory mediators. Given the deleterious effects to the host of
TNF-alpha, it is likely that TNF gene expression is tightly regulated.
In studies pertaining to macrophage response to LPS, Takashiba et al.
(1995) identified a novel DNA-binding domain that contains
transcriptional activity located from -550 to -487 in the human TNF
promoter. Sequence analysis of this fragment revealed the absence of any
known binding sites for nuclear factor kappa-B (see 164011). Myokai et
al. (1999) used this DNA fragment to isolate and purify a 60-kD protein
binding to the fragment. They obtained its N-terminal sequence, which
was used to design degenerate probes to screen a THP-1 cell cDNA
library. A novel 1.8-kb cDNA clone was isolated and fully sequenced.
Characterization of this cDNA clone revealed that its induction was
dependent on LPS activation of the THP-1 cells; hence the name
LPS-induced TNF-alpha factor (LITAF). Myokai et al. (1999) stated that
the open reading frame of LITAF encodes a 228-amino acid protein.
Inhibition of LITAF mRNA expression in THP-1 cells resulted in a
reduction of TNF-alpha transcripts. Northern blot analysis detected a
high level of LITAF mRNA expression predominantly in the placenta,
peripheral blood leukocytes, lymph nodes, and spleen.

Street et al. (2003) stated that SIMPLE/LITAF is a widely expressed gene
encoding a 161-amino acid protein.

By immunohistochemistry, Bennett et al. (2004) detected LITAF in the
cytoplasm of sciatic nerve Schwann cells, as well as in adipocytes, mast
cells, endothelial cells, and vascular smooth muscle cells.

Although 2 transcripts encoding different proteins (SIMPLE and LITAF)
had been reported from the same gene, Saifi et al. (2005) could not
confirm the existence of LITAF as originally identified by Myokai et al.
(1999) and showed that the longer LITAF transcript appears to have
resulted from a DNA sequencing error.

Lee et al. (2011) determined that the LITAF protein has a transmembrane
domain embedded within the cysteine-rich region that anchors the protein
to the membrane, suggesting that it is inserted into the membrane
posttranslationally. In the mouse, Litaf was highly expressed in Schwann
cells in peripheral nerves, with lower expression in brain and muscle.
It showed a punctate pattern in the cytoplasm of primary Schwann cells.
Endogenous Litaf localized to early endosomes, but not to late endosomes
or lysosomes.

In adult mouse and rat sciatic nerve, Lee et al. (2013) found that Litaf
localized in myelinating Schwann cells, but was not a structural
component of the myelin sheath or axon. Litaf was enriched in the
cytoplasmic regions at Schmidt-Lanterman incisures and paranodal
domains. There was colocalization with the early endosome marker Rab5
(179512).

GENE FUNCTION

Studies of Polyak et al. (1997) in a human colorectal cell line
indicated that LITAF expression was increased 10-fold in the presence of
the tumor suppressor p53, which is known to regulate pathways leading to
cellular growth arrest or apoptosis.

Street et al. (2003) suggested that LITAF may play a role in protein
degradation pathways.

GENE STRUCTURE

The LITAF gene contains 4 exons (Bennett et al., 2004).

MAPPING

By FISH, Myokai et al. (1999) mapped the LITAF gene to 16p13.3-p12.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Street et al. (2003) investigated the LITAF gene as the cause of
Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1C (CMT1C; 601098), which Street et al. (2002)
had mapped in 2 affected pedigrees to a 9-cM interval on 16p that
included the LITAF gene. They identified 3 missense mutations in the
gene encoding a 161-amino acid protein, each in a separate CMT1C
pedigree. The mutations were found to cluster and occurred at conserved
residues, defining a domain of the LITAF protein having a critical role
in peripheral nerve function. Western blot analysis suggested that 2 of
the mutations, T115N (603795.0002) and W116G (603795.0003), do not alter
the level of LITAF protein in peripheral blood lymphocytes. The LITAF
transcript was found to be expressed in rat sciatic nerve, but its level
of expression was not altered during development or in response to nerve
injury. Street et al. (2003) noted that this finding was in sharp
contrast to that seen for other known genes that cause CMT1.

Although 2 transcripts encoding different proteins (SIMPLE and LITAF)
had been reported from the same gene, Saifi et al. (2005) could not
confirm the existence of LITAF and showed that the LITAF transcript
appears to have resulted from a DNA sequencing error.

Saifi et al. (2005) screened the SIMPLE gene for mutations in a cohort
of 192 patients with CMT or related neuropathies, each of whom tested
negative for other known genetic causes of CMT. In 16 unrelated CMT
families, they identified 9 different nucleotide variations in SIMPLE
(see 603795.0001, 603795.0004) that were not detected in control
chromosomes. Saifi et al. (2005) concluded that SIMPLE mutations can
occur de novo, associated with sporadic CMT1, and may convey both
demyelinating and axonal forms.

Lee et al. (2011) found that CMT1C-associated LITAF mutations clustered
within or around the transmembrane domain and caused mislocalization of
the protein from the early endosomal membrane to the cytosol. Mutant
proteins were less stable and more prone to aggregation compared to the
wildtype protein. Aggregated proteins were degraded by both the
proteasome and aggresome-autophagy pathways.

ANIMAL MODEL

Tang et al. (2006) generated mice lacking Litaf in macrophages. They
found that cytokine induction in Litaf-deficient macrophages was reduced
compared with wildtype macrophages, and that mice lacking Litaf in
macrophages were more resistant to LPS-induced lethality. By studying
mouse macrophages lacking various Toll-like receptors (TLRs), Tang et
al. (2006) found that expression of Litaf could be induced by LPS
engagement of either Tlr2 (603028) or Tlr4 (603030), both of which
required Myd88 (602170). In response to LPS, the Myd88-dependent Litaf
pathway was independent of the Nfkb (see 164011) pathway, and p38-alpha
(MAPK14; 600289) was required for Litaf phosphorylation and
translocation to the nucleus.

Lee et al. (2013) found that transgenic mice carrying a homozygous Litaf
mutation (W116G; 603795.0003) developed progressive motor and sensory
impairment associated with decreased motor and sensory nerve conduction
velocities similar to that observed in CMT1C. Peripheral nerves of
mutant mice showed dysmyelination with reduced axon caliber and focal
myelin infoldings near the paranodal and internodal regions. Myelin
infolding was often linked to constricted axons with signs of impaired
axonal transport and to paranodal defects and abnormal organization of
the node of Ranvier. The W116G mutant protein was partially mislocalized
to the cytosol from the membrane. The findings suggested that the W116G
Litaf mutation disrupts myelin homeostasis and causes peripheral
neuropathy via a combination of toxic gain-of-function and
dominant-negative mechanisms. Myelin infolding and paranodal damage
appeared to represent pathogenic precursors preceding demyelination and
axonal degeneration in this disorder.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, TYPE 1C
LITAF, GLY112SER

In a family (K1551) segregating CMT1C (601098), Street et al. (2003)
identified a 334G-A transition in exon 3 of the LITAF gene, resulting in
a gly112-to-ser (G112S) substitution. The family had previously been
reported by Chance et al. (1990, 1992).

In affected members of a family with CMT1C and a patient with sporadic
CMT1C, Saifi et al. (2005) identified the G112S mutation.

In a 2-year-old boy with severe demyelinating CMT, Meggouh et al. (2005)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations: the G112S mutation
in LITAF and a PMP22 duplication (601097.0001), which is the most common
cause of CMT1A (118220). Each parent was heterozygous for 1 of the
mutations, and each had pes cavus and reduced nerve conduction
velocities consistent with mild CMT. Meggouh et al. (2005) concluded
that the cooccurrence of both mutations resulted in the more severe
phenotype in the proband.

.0002
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, TYPE 1C
LITAF, THR115ASN

In a family (K1550) segregating CMT1C (601098), Street et al. (2003)
identified a 344C-A transversion in the LITAF gene, resulting in a
thr115-to-asn (T115N) substitution. The family had previously been
reported by Chance et al. (1990, 1992).

.0003
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, TYPE 1C
LITAF, TRP116GLY

In a family segregating CMT1C (601098), Street et al. (2003) identified
a 346T-G transversion in the LITAF gene, resulting in a trp116-to-gly
(W116G) substitution.

.0004
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, TYPE 1C
LITAF, LEU122VAL

In a sporadic case of CMT1C (601098), Saifi et al. (2005) identified a
de novo heterozygous 364C-G transversion in exon 3 of the SIMPLE gene,
resulting in a leu122-to-val (L122V) substitution.

.0005
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, TYPE 1C
LITAF, VAL144MET

In a German mother and son with CMT1C (601098), Gerding et al. (2009)
identified a heterozygous 430G-A transition in exon 4 of the LITAF gene,
resulting in a val144-to-met (V144M) substitution. The mutation was not
observed in 400 control chromosomes. Both had typical demyelinating
sensorimotor neuropathy, but the son showed initial symptom onset at age
10, whereas the mother had onset of clinical symptoms in her late
fifties.

606626	TITLE *606626 DISHEVELLED-ASSOCIATED ACTIVATOR OF MORPHOGENESIS 1; DAAM1
;;KIAA0666
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening size-fractionated brain cDNA libraries for cDNAs with the
potential to encode proteins larger than 50 kD, Ishikawa et al. (1998)
identified a cDNA which they designated KIAA0666. KIAA0666 encodes a
1,085-amino acid protein predicted to function in cell division. It is
68% identical to the KIAA0381 protein (DAAM2; 606627). RT-PCR analysis
detected expression of KIAA0666 in all tissues tested.

Habas et al. (2001) identified a novel formin (see FMN1; 136535)
homology (FH) protein that they named DAAM1. DAAM1 is a widely expressed
protein that contains 1,078 amino acids and is identical to the KIAA0666
protein. Like other FH proteins, DAAM1 contains a central proline-rich
FH1 domain and a more C-terminal FH2 domain.

GENE FUNCTION

Wnt (see 164975) signaling via the frizzled receptor (Fz; see 600667)
controls cell polarity and movement during development. Habas et al.
(2001) reported that in human cells and during Xenopus embryogenesis,
Wnt/Fz signaling activated the small GTPase Rho (165390), a key
regulator of cytoskeleton architecture. Wnt/Fz activation of Rho
required the cytoplasmic protein dishevelled (DVL; see 601365) and
DAAM1. DAAM1 bound to both DVL and Rho and mediated Wnt-induced DVL-Rho
complex formation. Inhibition or depletion of DAAM1 prevented Wnt/Fz
activation of Rho and of Xenopus gastrulation, but did not prevent
activation of beta-catenin (116806) signaling.

Liu et al. (2008) showed that human DAAM1 was autoinhibited by an
intramolecular interaction between its N-terminal GTPase domain, which
includes an autoinhibitory domain, and its C-terminal autoregulatory
domain. Interaction of DAAM1 with DVL disrupted this autoinhibitory
interaction, resulting in DAAM1 activation. Mutations within or removal
of the autoregulatory domain converted DAAM1 into an active protein that
could induce Rho activation. Liu et al. (2008) also demonstrated that
Dvl synergized with Daam1 to regulate gastrulation during Xenopus
embryogenesis.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1998) mapped the DAAM1
gene to chromosome 14.

606158	TITLE *606158 BSCL2 GENE; BSCL2
;;SEIPIN;;
GNG3LG, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

BSCL2, or seipin, is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident protein that
is induced in late stages of preadipocyte differentiation and is
predicted to function in lipid droplet formation and/or metabolism (Cui
et al., 2011).

CLONING

Within a 2.5-Mb critical region for Berardinelli-Seip congenital
lipodystrophy type 2 (BSCL2; 269700), Magre et al. (2001) identified a
gene that is homologous to the mouse 'gamma-3-linked gene' (Gng3lg).
Magre et al. (2001) found that the BSCL2 open reading frame encodes a
deduced 398-amino acid protein, seipin, with at least 2 hydrophobic
amino acid stretches, indicating that it could be a transmembrane
protein. It has 87% identity to the mouse Gng3lg product, and partial
homology to Drosophila CG9904 protein. Using Northern blot analysis,
Magre et al. (2001) observed highest expression in brain and testis.
Dot-blot analysis indicated that the BSCL2 gene is highly expressed in
most regions of the central nervous system. Magre et al. (2001)
identified a putative initiation codon located in the second exon.
Agarwal and Garg (2004) noted that an alternative upstream initiation
codon could extend the seipin protein by 64 amino acids at the putative
N terminus.

By Northern blot analysis, Windpassinger et al. (2004) detected a 1.8-kb
brain-specific transcript in all brain regions examined and a 2.2-kb
transcript in placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and
pancreas. Fluorescence microscopy showed seipin and calreticulin
(109091) colocalized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of transfected
human umbilical vein endothelial cells. They identified a conserved
N-glycosylation site at residues 88 to 90.

Lundin et al. (2006) found that the predominant form of seipin is 462
residues in length, and is generated by an initiation site upstream of
the site found originally.

By immunoblot analysis of mouse and human cells transfected with
full-length BSCL2, Ito and Suzuki (2007) detected full-length seipin as
a 74-kD band and N- and C-terminal fragments of seipin between 35 and 48
kD, suggesting that seipin is highly modified after translation. Seipin
immunoreactivity was present in anterior horns of mouse spinal cord and
clearly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. Transiently expressed
human seipin appeared to be be proteolytically cleaved into an
N-terminal fragment, and full-length seipin was polyubiquitinated in
cultured neuronal and nonneuronal cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Ito et al. (2008) found expression of seipin in cortical neurons of
human frontal lobe and motor neurons of human spinal cord. Seipin
immunostaining was also observed specifically in mouse spermatids and
cells of the anterior lobe of the mouse pituitary gland. Cellular
studies in HeLa cells and mouse neuroblastoma cells indicated that
seipin has a glycosylated loop facing the ER lumen with both N and C
termini facing the cytosol. The first transmembrane domain is necessary
for ER retention. Neuronal and nonneuronal cells expressing the N88S
(606158.0013) and S90L (606158.0014) mutant proteins showed that both
mutant proteins localized correctly. Mutant cells also contained
inclusion bodies that were found to be distinct from aggresomes. The
second transmembrane domain was found to be critical for inclusion
formation, and both transmembrane domains were critical for activation
of the unfolded protein response (UPR). In a review of the function of
seipin and its role in disease, Ito and Suzuki (2009) noted that seipin
is an N-glycosylated protein that is proteolytically cleaved into N- and
C-terminal fragments and is polyubiquitinated.

GENE STRUCTURE

Magre et al. (2001) determined that the BSCL2 gene contains 11 exons
spanning at least 14 kb.

MAPPING

Magre et al. (2001) reported that the BSCL2 gene is homologous to the
mouse 'gamma-3-linked gene' (Gng3lg), which is localized in the region
of mouse chromosome 19 orthologous to human 11q. By positional cloning,
they located the BSCL2 gene within a 2.5-Mb critical region for a form
of Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Congenital Generalized Lipodystrophy type 2

In chromosome 11q13-linked families with congenital generalized
lipodystrophy type 2, and in 3 isolated patients, Magre et al. (2001)
identified mutations in the BSCL2 gene (606158.0001-606158.0012). Most
of the variants were null mutations predicted to result in the severe
disruption of the protein. Affected individuals were either homozygous
for a specific mutation or compound heterozygous; all parents of
unaffected sibs carried only 1 mutation. Magre et al. (2001) did not
find any mutation in affected individuals of the 9 families in which
BSCL is not linked to 11q13 or in 13 additional patients who had been
diagnosed with Lawrence syndrome (Lawrence, 1946), in which lipoatrophy
is not present at birth but develops at a later age.

Fu et al. (2004) screened for mutations in AGPAT2 (603100) and BSCL2 in
27 families with congenital generalized lipodystrophy. They found
mutations in either AGPAT2 or BSCL2 in all but 4 probands. Eighteen
patients with congenital generalized lipodystrophy from 15 families from
the same region of northeastern Brazil were homozygous for a frameshift
mutation in BSCL2 (669insA; 606158.0006). Despite having the same
mutation, the subjects had widely divergent clinical manifestations. Fu
et al. (2004) concluded that there did not appear to be any
distinguishing clinical characteristics between subjects with congenital
generalized lipodystrophy with AGPAT2 or BSCL2 mutations, with the
exception of mental retardation in carriers of BSCL2.

Szymanski et al. (2007) screened a yeast deletion library for aberrant
lipid droplets and found that absence of yeast seipin resulted in
irregular lipid droplets often clustered alongside proliferated ER;
giant lipid droplets were also seen. Electron microscopy showed abnormal
small irregular lipid droplets in fibroblasts from a BSCL2 patient with
a 5-bp deletion (606158.0005). In yeast, almost all lipid droplets
appeared to be on the ER, and seipin was found at these junctions. Human
seipin could functionally replace yeast seipin, but A212P
(606158.0009)-mutant human seipin that causes lipodystrophy could not.
Szymanski et al. (2007) hypothesized that seipin is important for lipid
droplet maintenance and perhaps assembly.

- Distal Hereditary Motor Neuropathy type VA and Silver Syndrome

In a large Austrian family with distal hereditary motor neuropathy type
VA (DSMAVA; 600794) reported by Auer-Grumbach et al. (2000),
Windpassinger et al. (2003) established linkage of the disorder to
11q12-q14, a chromosomal region overlapping that of Silver spastic
paraplegia syndrome (SPG17; 270685). Windpassinger et al. (2004)
confirmed linkage to the SPG17 locus in 16 additional families with a
phenotype characteristic of Silver syndrome. After refining the critical
region to 1 Mb, Windpassinger et al. (2004) sequenced the BSCL2 gene,
which lies within that region, and identified heterozygous mutations in
the family with DSMAV and those with SPG17. The mutations, asn88 to ser
(N88S; 606158.0013) and ser90 to leu (S90L; 606158.0014), affect
glycosylation of seipin and result in aggregate formation leading to
neurodegeneration. Windpassinger et al. (2004) noted that both DSMAV and
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2D (CMT2D; 601472) had already been
associated with mutation in the GARS gene (600287), indicating genetic
heterogeneity. Their findings indicated that Silver syndrome and some
forms of dHMN are, in fact, extreme phenotypes resulting from mutations
in the same gene. Both conditions are genetically heterogeneous, as some
individuals with each phenotype did not carry a BSCL2 mutation.

By in vitro functional expression analysis, Ito and Suzuki (2007)
demonstrated that the N88S and S90L mutations in the BSCL2 gene disrupt
glycosylation of the seipin protein. Overexpressed mutant seipin was
highly ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome, and improper
glycosylation exacerbated endoplasmic reticulum retention. Mutant
proteins activated the unfolded protein response, resulting in apoptotic
cell death through ER stress. Ito and Suzuki (2007) concluded that the
N88S and S90L mutations, which result in motor neuron disease, have a
gain-of-function effect, resulting in conformational protein changes,
activation of the unfolded protein response, cell death, and
neurodegeneration.

ANIMAL MODEL

Cui et al. (2011) obtained seipin -/- mice at the expected mendelian
ratio. Seipin -/- mice were growth delayed, but they eventually achieved
normal weight. They showed significantly reduced adipose tissue mass,
including about 60% reduction in brown adipose tissue, glucose
intolerance, hyperinsulinemia, and hepatic steatosis, with elevated
expression of select lipogenic genes. Levels of leptin (LEP; 164160) and
adiponectin (ADIPOQ; 605441) were significantly decreased in seipin -/-
mice, as were nonesterified fatty acids upon fasting.
Hypertriglyceridemia, which is common in human BSCL, was not observed in
seipin -/- mice.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
LIPODYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL GENERALIZED, TYPE 2
BSCL2, 2-BP DEL/3-BP INS, NT536

In 2 families with Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy (269700),
1 from eastern Norway and 1 from Italy, Magre et al. (2001) found
homozygosity for a mutation in exon 2 of the BSCL2 gene, the replacement
of 2 CC nucleotides at position 536 with 3 nucleotides (GGA), resulting
in a frameshift following phenylalanine-63 with a termination codon at
amino acid 75. They also found the mutation in heterozygous state in 2
affected families from southwestern Norway and the United Kingdom,
respectively. The phenotype presented at birth in the Norwegian and U.K.
families and before 9 months of age in the Italian family.

LIPODYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL GENERALIZED, TYPE 2
BSCL2, 2-BP INS, 645AA

In a consanguineous Brazilian family with Berardinelli-Seip congenital
lipodystrophy (269700), Magre et al. (2001) found homozygosity for an
insertion of 2 adenines at nucleotide 645 of the BSCL2 gene, resulting
in a frameshift and premature termination at codon 111.

.0003
LIPODYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL GENERALIZED, TYPE 2
BSCL2, 2-BP DEL, 659GT

In a French family segregating Berardinelli-Seip congenital
lipodystrophy (269700), Magre et al. (2001) identified compound
heterozygosity for mutations in the BSCL2 gene: deletion of 2 basepairs
(GT) at nucleotide 659, resulting in frameshift and premature
termination at codon 112; and a 258-bp deletion/12-bp insertion in exons
5-6 (606158.0004).

LIPODYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL GENERALIZED, TYPE 2
BSCL2, 5-BP DEL, NT659

Magre et al. (2001) found that all Lebanese patients with
Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy (269700) whom they studied
were homozygous for a frameshift mutation resulting from the deletion of
GTATC at nucleotide 659 of the BSCL2 gene.

In fibroblasts from a BSCL2 patient with the 5-bp deletion, Szymanski et
al. (2007) found abnormal cytoplasmic lipid droplets.

.0006
LIPODYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL GENERALIZED, TYPE 2
BSCL2, 1-BP INS, 669A

In 2 South African Portuguese families with Berardinelli-Seip congenital
lipodystrophy (269700), Magre et al. (2001) found homozygosity for a
frameshift resulting from insertion of an adenine at nucleotide 669 of
the BSCL2 gene.

Bhayana et al. (2002) described the same mutation in a 10-year-old girl
from Canada whose parents were not known to be consanguineous, although
they came from the same region of Portugal. The family history was
positive for BSCL on both sides of the family. Her father had 2 affected
male cousins who were born to consanguineous parents and died in
childhood. Another affected female first cousin of the father died at 30
years of age with renal failure. An affected male, the second cousin of
the patient's mother, died at 28 years of age. In addition to having the
typical attributes of complete lipodystrophy, the patient had been
diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in the first year of life. A
relationship between congenital lipodystrophy syndromes and cardiac
disorders is suggested by the fact that mutations in lamin A/C (LMNA;
150330) cause either lipodystrophy or cardiomyopathy.

Fu et al. (2004) found this mutation in 18 patients from 15 Caucasian
families from the same region of Serido county of Rio Grande do Norte
State in northeastern Brazil.

LIPODYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL GENERALIZED, TYPE 2
BSCL2, ARG138TER

In a French Portuguese family and 2 additional Portuguese families with
Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy (269700), Magre et al. (2001)
identified homozygosity for an arg138-to-stop mutation that resulted
from a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 756 of the BSCL2 gene.

.0008
LIPODYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL GENERALIZED, TYPE 2
BSCL2, IVS4, G-A, +1

In a consanguineous Turkish family segregating Berardinelli-Seip
congenital lipodystrophy (269700), Magre et al. (2001) identified a
G-to-A transition at the +1 position of intron 4, resulting in skipping
of exon 4.

.0009
LIPODYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL GENERALIZED, TYPE 2
BSCL2, ALA212PRO

In 4 southwestern Norwegian families segregating Berardinelli-Seip
congenital lipodystrophy (269700), Magre et al. (2001) identified a
G-to-C transversion at nucleotide 978 of the BSCL2 gene, resulting in an
alanine-to-proline substitution at codon 212. This mutation was found in
homozygosity in 3 of the families and in compound heterozygosity in 1.
The condition manifested at birth in these families.

LIPODYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL GENERALIZED, TYPE 2
BSCL2, 1-BP DEL, 980C

In a consanguineous Indian family segregating Berardinelli-Seip
congenital lipodystrophy (269700), Magre et al. (2001) identified
homozygosity for a mutation in the BSCL2 gene, the deletion of a C at
nucleotide 980 resulting in a frameshift at codon 213 and premature
termination at codon 232.

.0011
LIPODYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL GENERALIZED, TYPE 2
BSCL2, IVS6, G-A, +5

In a British family segregating Berardinelli-Seip congenital
lipodystrophy (269700), Magre et al. (2001) identified a G-to-A
transition at the +5 position of intron 6 of the BSCL2 gene, which
resulted in activation of a cryptic splice site leading to premature
termination at codon 225. The patient was compound heterozygous for this
mutation, and the condition manifested at birth.

.0012
LIPODYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL GENERALIZED, TYPE 2
BSCL2, IVS6, C-G, -3

In a Turkish French family segregating Berardinelli-Seip congenital
lipodystrophy (269700), Magre et al. (2001) identified homozygosity for
a C-to-G transversion at the -3 position of intron 6. This mutation
resulted in skipping of exon 7.

.0013
SILVER SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA SYNDROME
SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY, DISTAL, TYPE VA, INCLUDED
BSCL2, ASN88SER

In affected members of 1 English and 4 Austrian families with Silver
spastic paraplegia syndrome (SPG27; 270685), Windpassinger et al. (2004)
identified heterozygosity for a 263A-G transition in the BSCL2 gene,
resulting in an asn88-to-ser (N88S) mutation. The English family was the
original one reported by Silver (1966). In affected members of 1
Italian, 1 English, and 8 Austrian families with distal spinal muscular
atrophy (HMN5A; 600794), they identified the N88S mutation.

Auer-Grumbach et al. (2005) reported the phenotypic findings in 90
patients from 1 large Austrian family and 2 unrelated German families
with the N88S mutation. There was considerable phenotypic variability,
including asymptomatic nonpenetrance (4.4%), subclinical involvement
(20%), distal spinal muscular atrophy characterized by prominent hand
muscle involvement (31.1%), Silver syndrome (14.5%) with hand muscle
involvement and spasticity, a Charcot-Marie-Tooth-like phenotype with
distal muscle weakness and wasting of the lower limbs and sensory
abnormalities (20%), and spastic paraparesis without hand involvement
(10%). Auer-Grumbach et al. (2005) concluded that the N88S mutation
causes a motor neuron disease affecting the upper motor neurons, lower
motor neurons, or both. Hand muscle involvement was a frequent, although
not regular, feature, and sensory involvement was usually not present.
Genealogic studies of the Austrian kindred traced the disease to a
common parent pair born in 1682.

Van de Warrenburg et al. (2006) reported 2 Dutch families with multiple
affected individuals carrying a heterozygous N88S mutation. The
phenotype in both families overlapped between Silver syndrome and HMN5.
Affected members in both families had foot and lower limb atrophy with
slowly progressive hyperreflexia and extensor plantar responses without
prominent spasticity. Hand involvement occurred in most patients and was
restricted to interosseus muscles.

Brusse et al. (2009) reported 12 members of a large 3-generation Dutch
family with phenotypic overlap between Silver syndrome and distal HMN5
who carried a heterozygous N88S mutation. The phenotype was variable,
and the distribution of muscle weakness and atrophy included
predominantly the feet (in 4), the hands (in 1), or both upper and lower
extremities (in 4). Three individuals showed evidence of pyramidal
features, including spasticity, hyperrflexia, and extensor plantar
responses. Severity of the disease ranged from adolescent patients with
disabling muscle weakness to an elderly patient with only mild weakness
of the ankle dorsiflexors and bilateral pes cavus. Brusse et al. (2009)
noted the extreme phenotypic variability associated with the N88S
mutation in their family and in those reported by Auer-Grumbach et al.
(2005) and van de Warrenburg et al. (2006), and suggested the presence
of other genetic or environmental factors. In their family, Brusse et
al. (2009) used genomewide linkage analysis to identify a candidate
disease modifier on chromosome 16p13.3-p13.12 between SNPs dbSNP
rs6500882 and dbSNP rs7192086 that was shared by all 12 affected
individuals (maximum lod score of 3.28). One family member without the
N88S mutation but with the chromosome 16p haplotype showed mild
electrophysiologic abnormalities. Brusse et al. (2009) postulated that a
locus on chromosome 16p may contain a disease modifier in their family.

Chaudhry et al. (2013) identified a heterozygous N88S mutation in a man
with SPG17. He had onset of weakness of the hands and feet at around 12
years of age. Examination at age 14 showed distal weakness and wasting
with clawed hands and flat feet, extensor plantar responses, mild
tremor, and distal sensory impairment. The disorder was slowly
progressive, and he remained ambulatory with orthotics at age 36. His
affected uncle also carried the mutation, as did his unaffected mother,
suggesting incomplete penetrance. The mutation was identified by exome
sequencing of the proband. The family was originally reported by
Ionasescu et al. (1991) as having an X-linked form of CMT (302802).

SILVER SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA SYNDROME
BSCL2, SER90LEU

In affected members of a Belgian family and a Brazilian family with
Silver spastic paraplegia syndrome (SPG17; 270685), Windpassinger et al.
(2004) identified heterozygosity for a 269C-T transition in the BSCL2
gene, resulting in a ser90-to-leu (S90L) mutation.

.0015
LIPODYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL GENERALIZED, TYPE 2
BSCL2, ARG275TER

In 3 Japanese patients with Berardinelli-Seip congenital generalized
lipodystrophy (269700) from independent families, Ebihara et al. (2004)
identified a homozygous C-to-T transition in exon 8 of the BSCL2 gene
that resulted in premature termination of seipin at codon 275 (R275X).
Analysis of microsatellite markers and SNPs demonstrated common
ancestry. The authors stated that their study was the first report on
gene and phenotype analysis of congenital generalized lipodystrophy in
Japanese.

.0016
LIPODYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL GENERALIZED, TYPE 2
BSCL2, GLU189TER

In a Chinese infant with Berardinelli-Seip congenital generalized
lipodystrophy (269700), Friguls et al. (2009) identified a homozygous
565G-T transversion in exon 5 of the BSCL2 gene, resulting in a
glu189-to-ter (E189X) substitution. In addition to classic features of
the disorder, the patient had hypertension, an apical murmur, and severe
obstructive and asymmetric septal hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The
authors emphasized the early onset of severe cardiac disease in this
patient.

Jin et al. (2007) had identified the E189X mutation in another Chinese
boy with congenital generalized lipodystrophy with early-onset diabetes
mellitus.

PALS1-ASSOCIATED TIGHT JUNCTION PROTEIN; PATJ
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Phototransduction is the process that uses the energy of light to
generate an internal messenger, which subsequently leads to a transient
change of membrane potential in photoreceptor cells. Shieh and Niemeyer
(1995) found that the Drosophila melanogaster InaD (inactivation no
afterpotential D) protein is critically involved in regulation and
deactivation of the visual cascade. InaD contains 2 PDZ domains (see
PDZK1; 603831). One PDZ domain interacts with the TRP calcium channel,
which contributes to capacitative calcium entry into Drosophila
photoreceptor cells. By searching an EST database, Philipp and Flockerzi
(1997) identified a cDNA encoding a human homolog of InaD. The predicted
1,524-amino acid human protein, which the authors called INADL, shares
27% sequence identity with InaD. INADL contains 5 PDZ domains. Philipp
and Flockerzi (1997) also isolated cDNAs encoding truncated versions of
INADL that lack 2 or 3 PDZ domains. Northern blot analysis revealed that
INADL is expressed as a 5.4-kb mRNA in human brain; additional, less
abundant transcripts were also detected.

Roh et al. (2002) obtained a full-length cDNA encoding INADL, which they
termed PATJ. The protein contains 10 PDZ domains and is associated in
tight junctions with MPP5 (606958) and CRB1 (604210).

By database analysis, Lemmers et al. (2002) identified at least 6 human
INDAL cDNAs with alternative splicing or different translation
initiation sites. Northern blot analysis detected a major 7-kb
transcript in bladder, testis, ovary, small intestine, colon, heart,
skeletal muscle, and pancreas. A 4.1-kb transcript was also detected in
testis. Caco-2 human colon carcinoma cells expressed transcripts of 7,
4.1, and 3 kb, and RT-PCR revealed many alternative spliced forms.
Western blot analysis detected several INDAL proteins of 135 to 230 kD
in membrane fractions of human colon and transfected Caco-2 cells. A
75-kD protein was present in both membrane and cytosolic fractions of
Caco-2 cells. Immunoelectron microscopy localized INDAL near tight
junctions in human colon and Caco-2 cells, often on the apical side, and
also beneath the apical plasma membrane and in microvilli.

GENE FUNCTION

Vaccaro et al. (2001) determined the consensus ligand for each of 7
isolated PDZ domains of human INDAL by screening a random peptide
library displayed on lambda phage. Each PDZ domain had a unique peptide
binding preference.

Lemmers et al. (2002) found that overexpression of human INADL in canine
kidney cells disrupted localization of ZO1 (TJP1; 601009) and ZO3 (TJP3;
612689) to tight junctions. The N-terminal domain of INADL interacted
with the C-terminal region of CRB3 (609737), a putative tight junction
protein. Lemmers et al. (2002) concluded that INADL may be involved in
regulating the integrity of tight junctions.

Roh et al. (2002) determined that Tjp3 interacted with PATJ and that
both proteins colocalized to tight junctions in vivo. In vitro studies
showed that the sixth and eighth PDZ domains of PATJ mediated
interaction with the Tjp3 C-terminal domain and with Cldn1 (603718),
respectively. Roh et al. (2002) suggested that the TJP3-PATJ interaction
plays a role in recruiting PATJ and its associated proteins CRB1
(609737) and MPP5 (606958) to tight junctions.

Using RNA interference, Shin et al. (2005) showed that Patj knockdown in
canine kidney cells delayed tight junction formation and led to defects
in cell polarization. These effects were reversed by reintroduction of
Patj.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the INADL
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP RH94138).

607462	TITLE *607462 ATROPHIN 1; ATN1
;;DRPLA GENE; DRPLA
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In the search for a candidate gene for dentatorubral-pallidoluysian
atrophy (DRPLA; 125370), an inherited neurodegenerative disorder that
demonstrates genetic anticipation characteristic of unstable expansion
of trinucleotide repeats, Koide et al. (1994) searched a catalog of
genes expressed in human brain identified by Li et al. (1993) that
contained trinucleotide repeats. One of these, B37, which was known to
map to chromosome 12, was examined and found to show CAG repeat
expansion (607462.0001) in 22 individuals with DRPLA. By screening adult
human occipital cortex and fetal human brain cDNA libraries, Onodera et
al. (1995) isolated a full-length DRPLA cDNA encoding a deduced
1,185-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 125 kD. The
(CAG)n repeat that is expanded in patients with DRPLA is located at
position 1462 and is predicted to code for a polyglutamine tract. There
was high heterozygosity of the length of the polyglutamine tract,
ranging from 8 to 35 repeat units in 140 normal chromosomes. Northern
blot analysis revealed a 4.7-kb transcript that is widely expressed in
various tissues, including heart, lung, kidney, placenta, skeletal
muscle, and brain.

Using antibodies against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the
sequence of the C-terminus of the DRPLA gene product, Yazawa et al.
(1995) identified the DRPLA gene product in normal human brains as a
protein of approximately 190 kD. They also found a larger protein of
approximately 205 kD specifically in DRPLA brains.
Immunohistochemically, the DRPLA gene product was observed mainly in
neuronal cytoplasm. These results demonstrated the existence of the
expanded CAG repeat gene product and supported the possibility that the
expanded CAG-encoded polyglutamine stretch may participate in the
pathologic process of similar trinucleotide repeat diseases.

Schmitt et al. (1995) isolated the complete coding sequence of the rat
DRPLA gene and investigated its expression in different developmental
stages of rodent tissues. In rat, the length of the (CAG)n repeat is 7
to 34 repeats with an average of 15, which is mildly reduced in
comparison with the human repeats. Northern blot analysis demonstrated
that in rodents the gene is already expressed during embryonic
development. In addition, the transcript is predominantly represented in
neuronal tissues throughout all developmental stages investigated. Oyake
et al. (1997) cloned a mouse Drpla cDNA and found that the encoded
protein is 92% identical to human DRPLA.

MAPPING

Takano et al. (1996) assigned the DRPLA gene to chromosome 12p13.31 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

Oyake et al. (1997) mapped the mouse Drpla gene to chromosome 6 by
interspecific backcross analysis.

GENE FUNCTION

Burke et al. (1996) demonstrated that synthetic polyglutamine peptides,
DRPLA protein and huntingtin (613004) from unaffected individuals with
normal-sized polyglutamine tracts bind to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (138400). The authors postulated that diseases
characterized by the presence of an expanded CAG repeat may share a
common metabolic pathogenesis involving GAPD as a functional component.
Roses (1996) and Barinaga (1996) reviewed the findings.

Using the yeast 2-hybrid system, Wood et al. (1998) identified 5
atrophin-1 interacting proteins that bind to atrophin-1 in the vicinity
of the polyglutamine tract. Four of the interactions were confirmed
using in vitro binding assays. These interactors were found to be
similar to huntingtin-interacting proteins, suggesting possible
commonality of function between the 2 proteins responsible for the very
similar diseases, Huntington disease (HD; 143100) and DRPLA.

Zhang et al. (2002) characterized a Drosophila gene encoding an atrophin
family protein. Analysis of mutant phenotypes indicated that Drosophila
atrophin is required in diverse developmental processes, including early
embryonic patterning. Drosophila atrophin genetically interacts with the
transcription repressor 'even-skipped' (see 142991) and is required for
its repressive function in vivo. Drosophila atrophin directly binds to
even-skipped in vitro. Furthermore, both human atrophin-1 and Drosophila
atrophin repress transcription in vivo when tethered to DNA, and poly-Q
expansion in atrophin-1 reduces this repressive activity.

Okamura-Oho et al. (2003) determined that the DRPLA protein is a
phosphoprotein and that c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK; see 601158) is
one of the major factors involved in its phosphorylation.
Phosphorylation was demonstrated in a recombinant JNK activation system
in vitro and also in overexpressing cells by transfection after JNK
activation with osmotic pressure. Phosphorylation of serine-734 in the
DRPLA protein was confirmed by a specific antibody raised against the
phosphopeptide. Kinetic studies in the JNK recombinant system showed
that expanded polyQ slightly reduced the affinity of JNK to the protein.

Using yeast 2-hybrid screens, coaffinity purification analysis of
transfected HEK293 cells, and bioinformatic analysis, Lim et al. (2006)
developed an interaction network for 54 human proteins involved in 23
inherited ataxias. By database analysis, they expanded the core network
to include more distantly related interacting proteins that could
function as genetic modifiers. RBPMS (601558) was a main hub in the
network and interacted with many proteins, including the cerebellar
ataxia-associated proteins ATN1 and QK1 (609590).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 22 patients with dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (125370), Koide
et al. (1994) identified unstable expansion of a CAG unit in the ATN1
gene (607462.0001), which they termed B37 after a cDNA clone previously
identified by Li et al. (1993). Each patient was a heterozygote with 1
allele in the normal range (8-25 repeat units) and a second expanded
allele with the range of 54-68 repeat units. There were no overlaps in
the number of CAG repeat units between control chromosomes and DRPLA
chromosomes. In 33 patients with DRPLA from 12 families, Nagafuchi et
al. (1994) identified an expanded CAG repeat in the B37 clone. The
repeat size varied from 7-23 in normal individuals and 1 allele was
expanded to between 49-75 repeats in affected individuals.

Burke et al. (1994, 1994) demonstrated that affected members of the
large African American family with Haw River syndrome had the same
trinucleotide repeat expansion (607462.0001) in the ATN1 gene as that
found in DRPLA.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Martins et al. (2003) stated that DRPLA is prevalent in Japan, but
several families of non-Japanese ancestry had been published. To
identify the origin of expanded alleles in 4 Portuguese families with
DRPLA, they studied 2 intragenic SNPs in introns 1 and 3, in addition to
the CAG repeat, of the DRPLA gene. The results showed that all 4
families shared the same haplotype, which was the same as that reported
for Japanese DRPLA chromosomes. This haplotype is also the most frequent
in Japanese normal alleles, whereas it was rare in Portuguese control
chromosomes. The findings supported the suggestion that a founder DRPLA
haplotype of Asian origin was introduced in Portugal and is responsible
for the frequency of the disease in that country.

- Genetic Anticipation

Koide et al. (1994) found a good correlation between the size of the
(CAG)n repeat expansion and the age of onset. Patients with earlier
onset tended to have a phenotype of progressive myoclonic epilepsy and
larger expansions. They proposed that the wide variety of clinical
manifestations of DRPLA can be explained by the variable unstable
expansion of the CAG repeat. Although only 5 cases of paternal
transmission and 2 cases of maternal transmission were analyzed, the
length of the repeat unit was altered in all cases: the average change
in repeat length for paternal transmission was an increase of 4.2
repeats, while that of maternal transmission was a decrease of 1.0
repeat.

Nagafuchi et al. (1994) also found that repeat size correlated closely
with age of onset of symptoms and with disease severity. Expansion was
usually associated with paternal transmission. Komure et al. (1995)
analyzed CAG trinucleotide repeats in 71 individuals from 12 Japanese
DRPLA pedigrees that included 38 affected individuals. Normal alleles
varied from 7 to 23 repeats, whereas affected individuals had from 53 to
88 repeats. Like Koide et al. (1994) and Nagafuchi et al. (1994), they
found a significant negative correlation between CAG repeat length and
age of onset. In 80% of the paternal transmissions, there was an
increase of more than 5 repeats, whereas all the maternal transmissions
showed either a decrease or an increase of fewer than 5 repeats.

Aoki et al. (1994) demonstrated that anticipation with expansion of the
CAG repeat can occur through mothers as well as through fathers. They
investigated 2 families in which offspring showed progressive myoclonic
epilepsy with onset in childhood. In 1 family, patients of the first
generation showed mild cerebellar ataxia with onset at 52 to 60 years. A
patient of the second generation, the mother, showed severe ataxia with
onset in the early thirties. The offspring in the third generation
showed mental retardation, convulsions and myoclonus beginning at age 8.
Sano et al. (1994) studied 4 families and also demonstrated
anticipation. Older-onset patients suffered from cerebellar ataxia with
or without dementia, whereas younger-onset patients presented as
progressive myoclonus epilepsy syndrome, consisting of mental
retardation, dementia, and cerebellar ataxia as well as epilepsy and
myoclonus. Anticipation with paternal transmission was significantly
greater than with maternal transmission.

Sato et al. (1995) reported homozygosity for a modest (57-repeat)
triplet repeat in a man with early onset of DRPLA at age 17. His parents
were first cousins and were neurologically normal at ages 73 and 71, in
spite of having 57 CAG repeats in heterozygous state. Four of the
proband's sibs died at age 12 with the phenotype of progressive
myoclonic epilepsy. These findings supported the hypothesis that the
clinical features of DRPLA, like those of Machado-Joseph disease, are
influenced by the dosage of expansion of triplet repeats, unlike
Huntington disease, in which the homozygous state does not appear to be
different clinically from the heterozygous state.

Norremolle et al. (1995) described a Danish family in which affected
persons in at least 3 generations had been thought to be suffering from
Huntington disease. Because analysis of the huntingtin gene revealed
normal alleles and because some of the patients had seizures, they
analyzed the B37 gene and found significantly elongated CAG repeats, as
had been reported in cases of DRPLA. Norremolle et al. (1995) reported
that affected persons with almost identical repeat lengths presented
very different symptoms. Both expansion and contraction in paternal
transmission was observed.

Ikeuchi et al. (1996) analyzed the segregation patterns of 411
transmissions of 24 DRPLA pedigrees and 80 transmissions in 7
Machado-Joseph disease (MJD; 109150) pedigrees, with the diagnoses
confirmed by molecular testing. Significant distortions in favor of
transmission of the mutant alleles were found in male meiosis, where the
mutant alleles were transmitted to 62% of all offspring in DRPLA (P less
than 0.01) and 73% in MJD (P less than 0.01). The results were
considered consistent with meiotic drive in both disorders. The authors
commented that since more prominent meiotic instability of the length of
the CAG trinucleotide repeats is observed in male meiosis than in female
meiosis and since meiotic drive is observed only in male meiosis, these
results raised the possibility that a common molecular mechanism
underlies the meiotic drive and the meiotic instability in male meiosis.

On the basis of studies in an extensively affected Tennessee family,
Potter (1996) emphasized the intrafamilial variability and lack of close
correlation between age of onset and (CAG)n repeat number in this
disease. The studies were done on DNA derived from leukocytes;
tissue-specific instability (somatic mosaicism) has been reported in
DRPLA.

Takiyama et al. (1999) determined the CAG repeat size in 427 single
sperm from 2 men with DRPLA. The mean variance of the change in the CAG
repeat size in sperm from the DRPLA patients (288.0) was larger than any
variances of the CAG repeat size in sperm from patients with
Machado-Joseph disease (38.5), Huntington disease (69.0), and spinal and
bulbar muscular atrophy (16.3; 313200), which is consistent with the
clinical observation that the genetic anticipation on the paternal
transmission of DRPLA is the most prominent among CAG repeat diseases.
The variance was different in the 2 patients (51.0 vs 524.9, P greater
than 0.0001). The segregation ratio of normal to expanded allele sperm
was 1:1.

ANIMAL MODEL

To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying CAG repeat
instability, Sato et al. (1999) established 3 transgenic lines, each
harboring a single copy of a full-length human mutant DRPLA gene
carrying a CAG repeat expansion. These transgenic mice exhibited an
age-dependent increase (+0.31 per year) in male transmission and an
age-dependent contraction (-1.21 per year) in female transmission.
Similar tendencies in intergenerational instabilities were also observed
in human DRPLA parent-offspring pairs. The intergenerational
instabilities of the CAG repeats may be interpreted as being derived
from the instability occurring during continuous cell division of
spermatogonia in the male, and that occurring during the period of
meiotic arrest in the female. The transgenic mice also exhibited an
age-dependent increase in the degree of somatic mosaicism that occurred
in a cell lineage-dependent manner, with the size range of CAG repeats
being smaller in the cerebellum than in other tissues, including the
cerebrum, which was consistent with observations in autopsied tissues of
DRPLA patients. Thus, the transgenic mice described by Sato et al.
(1999) exhibited age-dependent intergenerational and somatic
instabilities of expanded CAG repeats comparable with those observed in
human DRPLA patients, and should therefore serve as good models for
investigating the molecular mechanisms of instabilities of CAG repeats.

In comparing transgenic mice bearing either full-length atrophin-1 or
partial huntingtin trans-proteins to wildtype, Luthi-Carter et al.
(2002) reported that there was considerable overlap in the alteration of
gene expression between the 2 models, at least in the cerebellum. The
authors concluded that polyglutamine-induced changes may be independent
of their protein context.

Sato et al. (2009) generated a DRPLA Q129 mouse resulting from en masse
expansion of the 76 CAG repeat in a Q76 mouse breeding program. Only the
Q129 mice exhibited devastating progressive neurologic phenotypes
similar to those of juvenile-onset DRPLA patients. Electrophysiologic
studies demonstrated age-dependent and region-specific presynaptic
dysfunction in the globus pallidus and cerebellum. Progressive shrinkage
of distal dendrites of Purkinje cells and decreased currents through
AMPA receptors (see 138248) and GABA-A (see 137160) receptors in CA1
neurons were also observed. The Q129 mice developed progressive brain
atrophy but no obvious neuronal loss, associated with massive neuronal
intranuclear accumulation (NIA) of mutant proteins with expanded polyQ
stretches starting on postnatal day 4, whereas NIA in the Q76 mice
appeared later with regional specificity to the vulnerable regions of
DRPLA. Expression profile analysis demonstrated age-dependent
downregulation of genes, including those relevant to synaptic functions
and CREB (123810)-dependent genes. Sato et al. (2009) suggested that
neuronal dysfunction without neuronal death is the essential
pathophysiologic process and that the age-dependent NIA is associated
with nuclear dysfunction including transcriptional dysregulations.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
DENTATORUBRAL-PALLIDOLUYSIAN ATROPHY
ATN1, (CAG)n EXPANSION

In 22 patients with dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA;
125370), Koide et al. (1994) identified unstable expansion of a CAG unit
in the DRPLA gene, which they termed B37 after a cDNA clone previously
identified by Li et al. (1993). Each patient was a heterozygote with 1
allele in the normal range (8-25 repeat units) and a second expanded
allele with the range of 54-68 repeat units. There were no overlaps in
the number of CAG repeat units between control chromosomes and DRPLA
chromosomes.

Burke et al. (1994, 1994) demonstrated that affected members of the
large African American family with Haw River syndrome had a
trinucleotide repeat expansion in the ATN1 gene that was identical to
that found in DRPLA, a frequent disorder in Japanese but rare in
Europeans. In addition to the difference in racial frequency, the
clinical expression and pathology of Haw River syndrome differed from
that of the disease as observed in the Japanese: seizures were a
consistent feature, there was no myoclonus, basal ganglion calcification
was common, and neuronal loss was prominent in the globus pallidus.
Burke et al. (1994, 1994) suggested that the difference in racial
frequency is probably due to differences in the repeat size. The
frequency of the repeat allele of intermediate size was very low in
Europeans, somewhat higher in African Americans, and relatively high
(5-10%) in Japanese.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The CCM complex, which includes CCM1 (KRIT1; 604214), CCM2, and CCM3
(PDCD10; 609118), is associated with cytoskeletal elements, signal
transduction components, and cell junctions (Hogan et al., 2008).

CLONING

In a study of cerebral cavernous malformations type 2 (603284), Liquori
et al. (2003) performed mutational analysis on a positional candidate
gene, MGC4607 (CCM2), located in the critical linkage region in the UCSC
human genome assembly. The gene was chosen because its translation
product contains a putative PTP domain. The same domain had been found
in ICAP1-alpha (607153), a binding partner of the CCM1 product KRIT1
(604214), which is mutant in cerebral cavernous malformations type 1
(116860).

Liquori et al. (2003) named the novel protein encoded by the CCM2 gene
malcavernin. They suggested that it may be part of the complex pathway
of integrin signaling that, when perturbed, causes abnormal vascular
morphogenesis in the brain, leading to CCM formation. Liquori et al.
(2003) found, from Northern blot analysis of human tissues, using the
entire cDNA as a probe, that MCG4607 is most highly expressed in
skeletal muscle, heart, and liver, with minimal or no expression in the
colon and lung. MGC4607 is also expressed in the brain.

Using Western blot analysis, Uhlik et al. (2003) found that CCM2, which
they called OSM, was expressed in the majority of mouse and human cell
types tested. Northern blot and in situ hybridization of mouse tissues
showed highest Osm expression in nervous system and lymphoid tissues.

GENE STRUCTURE

Liquori et al. (2003) determined that the CCM2 gene contains 10 exons
and spans 77.6 kb. It contains LINE and SINE elements, including Alu
sequences, within intron 1 and the 3-prime region distal to exon 10.

MAPPING

By linkage analysis, Craig et al. (1998) mapped the CCM2 gene to
chromosome 7p15-p13.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a mouse T-cell cDNA library, Uhlik et al.
(2003) showed that a C-terminal fragment of mouse Osm interacted with
Mekk3 (MAP3K3; 602539), a p38 (MAPK14; 600289) activator that responds
to sorbitol-induced hyperosmotic conditions. Mekk3 and Osm colocalized
in the cytoplasmic compartment of cotransfected cells, and the Mekk3-Osm
complex was recruited to Rac1 (602048)- and cytoskeletal actin (see
102560)-containing membrane ruffles in response to sorbitol treatment.
Protein interaction assays showed that Osm interacted directly with the
Mekk3 substrate Mkk3 (MAP2K3; 602315), with actin, and with both GDP-
and GTP-loaded Rac1. Uhlik et al. (2003) concluded that the
RAC1-OSM-MEKK3-MKK3 complex is required for regulation of p38 activity
in response to osmotic shock.

Zawistowski et al. (2005) used coimmunoprecipitation, fluorescence
resonance energy transfer, and subcellular localization strategies to
show that KRIT1 interacted with CCM2. Analogous to the established
interactions of KRIT1/ITGB1 (135630) and KRIT1/ICAP1, the KRIT1/CCM2
association was dependent upon phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain of
CCM2. A familial CCM2 L198R mutation (607929.0007) abrogated the
KRIT1/CCM2 interaction, suggesting that loss of this interaction may be
critical in CCM pathogenesis. CCM2 and ICAP1, when bound to KRIT1 via
their respective PTB domains, differentially influenced KRIT1
subcellular localization. The authors expanded upon the established
involvement of CCM2 in the p38 MAPK signaling module by demonstrating
that KRIT1 associated with CCM2 and MEKK3 in a ternary complex.
Zawistowski et al. (2005) proposed that the genetic heterogeneity
observed in familial CCM may reflect mutation of different molecular
members of a coordinated signaling complex.

By GST pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation analysis, Voss et al. (2007)
demonstrated that CCM2 coprecipitated and colocalized with CCM3 (PDCD10;
609118). Yeast 2-hybrid analysis showed that CCM3 directly bound to
STK25 (602255) and the phosphatase domain of FAP1 (600267). CCM3 was
phosphorylated by STK25, whereas the C-terminal domain of FAP1
dephosphorylated CCM3. Further experiments showed that STK25 and CCM2
formed a protein complex. The findings linked CCM3 and STK25 with CCM2,
which is part of signaling pathways that are essential for vascular
development. Voss et al. (2007) hypothesized that CCM3 is part of the
KRIT1/CCM2 protein complex through its interaction with CCM2, and
therefore may participate in CCM1-dependent modulation of ITGB1
signaling.

Using RNA interference, Crose et al. (2009) showed that knockdown of
Ccm2 in mouse brain endothelial cells led to increased monolayer
permeability, decreased tubule formation, and reduced cell migration
following wounding. These effects were associated with elevated levels
of RhoA (165390), a small GTPase necessary for cytoskeletal turnover and
migration. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis revealed that both Ccm2 and
Mekk3 directly bound the RhoA ubiquitin ligase Smurf1 (605568). Domain
analysis revealed that the PTB domain of Ccm2 directly bound the HECT
domain of Smurf1, and the interaction targeted Smurf1 to Ccm2 complexes
localized primarily at the cell periphery. Coexpression of Ccm2 and
Smurf1 led to cell rounding, likely due to loss of RhoA. Crose et al.
(2009) concluded that CCM2 contributes to endothelial cell integrity by
regulating SMURF1-directed RHOA degradation

Kleaveland et al. (2009) showed that knockdown of CCM2 in human
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) via small hairpin RNA had no
effect on cell size, proliferation, migration, or formation of branching
structures. However, branched cords formed by CCM2-knockdown HUVECs
often lacked visible lumens, suggesting a defect in endothelial tube
formation. Using mice and zebrafish lacking Ccm2 and/or Heg1 (614182)
and CCM2-knockdown HUVECs, Kleaveland et al. (2009) showed that
CCM2-HEG1 signaling regulated endothelial tube formation and endothelial
junction formation. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments and pull-down
assays in transfected HEK293T cells suggested a model in which HEG1
coupled with CCM2 primarily through interaction with KRIT1 at
endothelial cell-cell junctions.

Borikova et al. (2010) showed that knockdown of Ccm1, Ccm2, or Ccm3 in
mouse embryonic endothelial cells induced RhoA overexpression and
persistent RhoA activity at the cell edge, as well as in the cytoplasm
and nucleus. RhoA activation was especially pronounced following Ccm1
knockdown. Knockdown of Ccm1, Ccm2, or Ccm3 inhibited formation of
vessel-like tubes and invasion of extracellular matrix. Knockdown or
inhibition of Rock2 countered these effects and was associated with
inhibition of RhoA-stimulated phosphorylation of myosin light chain-2
(MLC2; see 160781). Borikova et al. (2010) concluded that the CCM
protein complex regulates RhoA activation and cytoskeletal dynamics.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Liquori et al. (2003) screened a cohort of 37 probands with cerebral
cavernous malformations for KRIT1 mutations and found mutations of this
gene in 10. Among the panel of 27 probands without a KRIT1 mutation,
they detected 8 different mutations in MGC4607. One mutation, a 4-bp
deletion (607929.0004), was found in 2 separate families which, as
suggested by a further investigation into ethnic background, may be
distantly related.

Denier et al. (2004) likewise identified the MGC4607 gene as the CCM2
gene. They narrowed the CCM2 linkage interval from 22 cM to 7.5 cM. They
then hypothesized that large deletions might be involved in the
disorder, as already reported in other hamartomatous conditions such as
tuberous sclerosis (191100) and neurofibromatosis (162200). They
performed a high density microsatellite genotyping of this 7.5-cM
interval in search of putative null alleles in 30 unrelated families. In
this way, they identified, in 2 families, null alleles that were the
result of deletions within a 350-kb interval. Additional microsatellite
and single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping showed that these 2
distinct deletions overlapped and that both of them deleted the first
exon of MGC4607. In both families, 1 of the 2 MGC4607 transcripts was
not detected. They then identified 8 additional point mutations within
MGC4607 in 8 of the remaining families. One of them led to the
alteration of the initiation codon and 5 of them to a premature
termination, including 1 nonsense, 1 frameshift, and 3 splice-site
mutations. The findings in cerebral cavernous malformations strongly
suggest that MGC4607 has a role in vascular morphogenesis.

Liquori et al. (2007) commented that DNA sequence analysis of the genes
CCM1 (KRIT1), CCM2, and CCM3 (PDCD10) in a cohort of 63 CCM-affected
families showed that 40% of these lacked any identifiable mutation. The
data suggested either that another CCM gene exists or that a significant
fraction of CCM mutations are not found by routine DNA sequence
analysis. Potential mutations that would be undetected by sequence
analysis included mutations within regulatory regions not included in
routine sequencing, as well as larger genomic insertions, deletions, or
duplications. Liquori et al. (2007) used multiplex ligation-dependent
probe analysis to screen 25 probands who were negative for CCM1, -2, and
-3 mutations for potential deletions or duplications within these 3
genes. They identified 15 deletions: 1 in the CCM1 gene, none in the
CCM3 gene, and 14 in the CCM2 gene. In this cohort, mutation screening
that included sequence and deletion analyses gave disease-gene
frequencies of 40% for CCM1, 38% for CCM2, 6% for CCM3, and 16% with no
mutation detected. The data indicated that the prevalence of CCM2 is
much higher than previously predicted, nearly equal to CCM1, and that
large genomic deletions in the CCM2 gene represent a major component of
this disorder. A common 77.6-kb deletion spanning CCM2 exons 2 through
10 was identified, which was present in 13% of the entire CCM cohort
(607929.0008). Liquori et al. (2007) hypothesized that these deletions
occurred in a hypermutable region because of surrounding repetitive
sequence elements and may catalyze the formation of intragenic
deletions.

In 2 (14%) of 14 unrelated patients with sporadic CCM and multiple
lesions, Felbor et al. (2007) identified a respective deletion in the
CCM2 gene using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. One of
the deletions involved the entire coding region of the CCM2 gene.

Among 24 Italian families with CCM, Liquori et al. (2008) identified 4
deletions and 1 duplication in the CCM2 gene.

For each of the 3 CCM genes, Pagenstecher et al. (2009) showed complete
localized loss of either KRIT1, CCM2/malcavernin, or PDCD10 protein
expression depending on the respective inherited mutation. Cavernous but
not adjacent normal or reactive endothelial cells of known germline
mutation carriers displayed immunohistochemical negativity only for the
corresponding CCM protein, but stained positively for the 2 other
proteins. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated endothelial cell
mosaicism as neoangiogenic vessels within caverns from a CCM1 patient,
normal brain endothelium from a CCM2 patient, and capillary endothelial
cells of vessels in a revascularized thrombosed cavern from a CCM3
patient stained positively for KRIT1, CCM2/malcavernin, and PDCD10
respectively. Pagenstecher et al. (2009) suggested that complete lack of
CCM protein in affected endothelial cells from CCM germline mutation
carriers supports a 2-hit mechanism for CCM formation.

Through repeated cycles of amplification, subcloning, and sequencing of
multiple clones per amplicon, Akers et al. (2009) identified somatic
mutations that were otherwise invisible by direct sequencing of the bulk
amplicon. Biallelic germline and somatic mutations were identified in
CCM lesions from all 3 forms of inherited CCMs. The somatic mutations
were found only in a subset of the endothelial cells lining the
cavernous vessels and not in interstitial lesion cells. Although widely
expressed in the different cell types of the brain, the authors also
suggested a unique role for the CCM proteins in endothelial cell
biology. Akers et al. (2009) suggested that CCM lesion genesis may
require complete loss of function for 1 of the CCM genes.

Gallione et al. (2011) identified a founder mutation in the Ashkenazi
Jewish population that affects mRNA splicing of the CCM2 gene causing
cerebral cavernous malformations (607929.0010).

ANIMAL MODEL

Hogan et al. (2008) found that deletion of Ccm1 in zebrafish caused
dilation of embryonic vessels. Vascular dilation was associated with
progressive spreading of endothelial cells and thinning of vessel walls.
Determination of cell fate, cell number, and endothelial cell-cell
contacts appeared normal. Ccm1 mutants, Ccm2 mutants, and Ccm1/Ccm2
double mutants had indistinguishable vascular phenotypes, suggesting
conservation of function.

Boulday et al. (2011) noted that deletion of Ccm1, Ccm2, or Ccm3 in mice
is embryonic lethal. They generated mice with an endothelial-specific
Ccm2 deletion at postnatal day 1, which resulted in vascular lesions
mimicking human CCM lesions. Deletion of Ccm1 or Ccm3 at postnatal day 1
resulted in similar cerebellar and retinal lesions. Ccm2 lesion
development was restricted to the venous bed. Boulday et al. (2011)
concluded that the consequences of Ccm2 deletion depend on the
developmental timing of the ablation and are associated with a
developmental stage with intense angiogenesis.

In a family in which 4 members had type 2 cerebral cavernous
malformations (603284), Liquori et al. (2003) found a 1-bp deletion in
exon 1 of the CCM2 gene (23delG), causing a frameshift at amino acid 23
and premature termination at amino acid 22.

In a family in which 2 members had type 2 cerebral cavernous
malformations (603284), Liquori et al. (2003) found a 319C-T transition
in exon 4 of the CCM2 gene, resulting in the nonsense mutation gln107 to
ter (Q107X).

.0003
CEREBRAL CAVERNOUS MALFORMATIONS 2
CCM2, IVS5, G-A, -1

In a family in which 5 members had type 2 cerebral cavernous
malformations (603284), Liquori et al. (2003) found a splice junction
mutation (610-1G-A), involving the invariant G residue at the splice
acceptor site adjacent to exon 6.

.0004
CEREBRAL CAVERNOUS MALFORMATIONS 2
CCM2, 4-BP DEL, NT169

In one family with 5 affected individuals and a second family with 4
affected individuals, Liquori et al. (2003) found that type 2 cerebral
cavernous malformations (603284) were associated with a 4-bp deletion in
exon 2 of the CCM2 gene (169-172delAGAC). The deletion caused a
frameshift at amino acid 57 with a premature stop at amino acid 58. Two
families were thought to be distantly related because they came from the
same ethnic background.

.0005
CEREBRAL CAVERNOUS MALFORMATIONS 2

In affected members of a family with cerebral cavernous malformations
(603284), Denier et al. (2004) found a mutation in the initiating ATG
codon changing nucleotide 1 from A to G. In this family, 2 sisters and
the daughter of 1 of them were affected.

In a family with cerebral cavernous malformations (603284), Denier et

mutation in exon 5 due to a T-to-G transversion at nucleotide 593. In
this family, a brother and sister were affected as well as a daughter
and son.

nucleotides, 1248_1249delAG in exon 10 of the CCM2 gene.

.0009
CEREBRAL CAVERNOUS MALFORMATIONS 2
CCM2, 77.6-KB DEL

Among a cohort of 63 families with cerebral cavernous malformations
(603284), Liquori et al. (2007) identified a 77.6-kb deletion in the
CCM2 gene in 8 probands (13%). The deletion encompassed exons 2 through
10, with the proximal breakpoint within an AluSx repeat in intron 1 and
the distal breakpoint within an AluSg repeat distal to exon 10.
Haplotype analysis suggested that this deletion may have occurred
independently at least twice in their cohort, although the evidence was
not conclusive.

Liquori et al. (2008) reported 6 additional CCM families from the United
States with the 77.6-kb CCM2 deletion. Haplotype analysis, which
included the previously reported families with this deletion, indicated
a founder effect. This deletion was not present in 24 Italian families
with CCM, indicating that it is specific to a certain cohort of
patients.

.0010
CEREBRAL CAVERNOUS MALFORMATIONS 2
CCM2, IVS1, GC-TT, +5

In 7 apparently unrelated probands from 10 different kindreds of
Ashkenazi Jewish descent segregating CCM2 (603284), Gallione et al.
(2011) identified a 2-bp change in the CCM2 gene caused by deletion of a
GC pair and insertion of a TT pair near the splice donor site of exon 1
(30+5_6delinsTT). The 2-bp change segregated with affected status in the
study families. Transcripts arising from the normal and mutant alleles
were examined by RT-PCR from affected and unaffected Ashkenazi Jewish
cerebral cavernous malformation family members. A synthetic splicing
system using a chimeric exon was used to visualize the effects of the
change on splice donor site utilization. The 2-bp change, when tested in
this in vitro synthetic splicing system, altered splice donor site
utilization. RT-PCR revealed loss of the transcript allele that was in
phase with the mutation. Gallione et al. (2011) concluded that this 2-bp
change in CCM2 disruted proper splice donor utilization leading to a
degraded transcript. Resequencing of the genomic region proximal and
distal to the CCM2 gene mutation revealed a common SNP haplotype in
affected individuals that demonstrated that this mutation was due to a
founder in the Ashkenazi Jewish population.

614460	TITLE *614460 UBIQUITIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE 47; USP47
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

USP47 belongs to a family of ubiquitin-specific cysteine proteases.
These enzymes catalyze the removal of ubiquitin from proteins that are
ubiquitinated and thus targeted for degradation via the proteasome
(Quesada et al., 2004).

CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to USP family members,
followed by PCR of human cDNA libraries, Quesada et al. (2004) cloned
USP47. The deduced protein has a catalytic domain containing a cys box,
a QQD box, and a his box, all of which are characteristic of USP
enzymes. Northern blot analysis detected high expression of a 5.5-kb
transcript in skeletal muscle, with lower expression in testis and
heart, and little to no expression in other tissues examined.

SKP1 (601434)/CUL1 (603134)/F-box protein (see 609102) (SCF) complexes
function as E3 ubiquitin ligases. By mass spectrometric analysis of
peptides that immunoprecipitated with an SCF complex containing
beta-TRCP2 (FBXW11; 603482) as its F-box protein subunit, Peschiaroli et
al. (2010) identified USP47. The deduced full-length protein contains
1,287 amino acids.

GENE FUNCTION

Peschiaroli et al. (2010) found that the F-box proteins beta-TRCP1
(BTRC; 603482) and beta-TRCP2, but not other F-box proteins, bound
USP47. Mutation analysis revealed that an N-terminal domain of USP47
interacted with the WD40 repeat domain of beta-TRCP. Knockdown of either
USP47 or beta-TRCP in several human cell lines reduced cell survival and
sensitized cells to pharmacologic induction of apoptosis. However,
beta-TRCP did not appear to use USP47 as a substrate or induce its
degradation. Conversely, knockdown of USP47 had no effect on beta-TRCP
activity.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the USP47 gene to chromosome 11p15.3 based on an
alignment of the USP47 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK000734) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

ANIMAL MODEL

Peschiaroli et al. (2010) found that mice homozygous for a hypomorphic
Usp47 allele were viable and fertile. However, fibroblasts derived from
homozygous mutant embryos were more sensitive than wildtype to
ultraviolet radiation-induced apoptosis.

142370	TITLE *142370 HEMOPOIETIC CELL KINASE; HCK
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

HCK is an SRC (190090) family tyrosine kinase that is expressed
predominantly in granulocytic and monocytic cells. It has proposed
functional roles in phagocytosis and receptor-mediated signaling
(summary by Scott et al., 2002).

CLONING

During a search for a cDNA clone representing human SRC (190090),
Quintrell et al. (1987) encountered a previously unrecognized gene that
appeared to encode a protein-tyrosine kinase similar to SRC. Ziegler et
al. (1987) found the same gene by a different route. Expression of this
gene may be limited to certain hemopoietic cells and is especially
prominent in cells of myeloid lineage, particularly mature granulocytes
and monocytes. Therefore, Quintrell et al. (1987) designated the gene
HCK (pronounced 'hick') for hemopoietic cell kinase. They described the
nucleotide sequence of a cDNA clone representing most or all of the mRNA
for HCK, the deduced amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by HCK,
and the distribution of RNA transcribed from HCK among various
hemopoietic cells. The deduced HCK protein contains 505 amino acids and
has a calculated molecular mass of about 57 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Using mass spectrometric analysis, Scott et al. (2002) identified 25
potential binding partners in a human monocyte cell line for the SH3
domain of HCK. Analysis with purified proteins and in intact cells
confirmed the interactions with WIP (WIPF1; 602357), WASP (WAS; 300392),
and ELMO1 (606420). ELMO1 was heavily tyrosine phosphorylated in cells
coexpressing HCK and ELMO1, suggesting that ELMO1 is a HCK substrate.
Pull-down analysis showed that binding of ELMO1 to the HCK SH3 domain
could be inhibited by polyproline peptides, indicating that an ELMO1
polyproline motif interacts with HCK. Scott et al. (2002) concluded that
WIP, WASP, and ELMO1 may be activators or effectors of HCK.

MAPPING

By spot-blot analysis of sorted chromosomes and by in situ
hybridization, Quintrell et al. (1987) assigned the HCK gene to
chromosome 20q11-q12. Since this region is affected by interstitial
deletions in some acute myeloid leukemias and myeloproliferative
disorders, they suggested that damage to HCK may contribute to the
pathogenesis of these conditions.

610464	TITLE *610464 G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR 156; GPR156
;;GABABL
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute a large superfamily of
proteins that transmit signals from extracellular messenger molecules
and sensory stimuli to intracellular signaling pathways. GPR156 belongs
to the glutamate receptor subfamily of GPCRs (Bjarnadottir et al.,
2005).

CLONING

By database searching for sequences homologous to those of the GABA-B
receptor subunits GABBR1 (603540) and GABBR2 (607340), Calver et al.
(2003) identified GPR156, which they called GABABL, and subsequently
cloned a full-length GPR156 cDNA from a fetal brain cDNA library. The
deduced 814-amino acid protein contains a putative coiled-coil domain
and dileucine and several RXR(R) endoplasmic reticulum retention motifs
in the C terminus. Semiquantitative RT-PCR showed expression of GPR156
at high levels in human testis, moderate levels in fetal brain, and low
levels in all other tissues and brain regions tested. Within neural
tissues, expression was highest in the pituitary gland. Northern blot
analysis detected transcripts of 4.0, 4.5, and 5.0 kb in testis,
suggesting alternative splicing. Antibodies developed against
GPR156-specific peptides detected a protein of 87 kD in rat brain and in
membranes from HEK293 cells. Studies of rat brain showed abundant
expression in the olfactory tubercles, islands of Calleja, nucleus
accumbens, piriform cortex, and all fields of the hippocampus.

By database analysis, Bjarnadottir et al. (2005) identified GABABL
orthologs in mouse and fish. The deduced mouse protein contains 798
amino acids.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bjarnadottir et al. (2005) determined that the GPR156 gene contains 9
exons.

GENE FUNCTION

By cotransfection of HEK293 cells with GPR156 and either GABBR1 or
GABBR2, Calver et al. (2003) demonstrated that GPR156 could not
substitute for either GABA-B subunit in a functional GABA-B receptor.
Human GPR156 protein expression could only be detected with the addition
of an exogenous signal sequence.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Calver et al. (2003) mapped the GPR156
gene to chromosome 3q13-q22.

By genomic sequence analysis, Bjarnadottir et al. (2005) mapped the
GPR156 gene to chromosome 3q13.33. They mapped the mouse Gpr156 gene to
chromosome 16.

611161	TITLE *611161 KERATIN 80; KRT80
;;KERATIN B20; KB20
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Keratins, such as KRT80, are filament proteins that make up one of the
major structural fibers of epithelial cells (Rogers et al., 2005).

CLONING

Using database analysis to identify keratin genes within the type II
keratin gene domain on chromosome 12, Rogers et al. (2005) identified
KRT80, which they called KB20. The deduced 452-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 50.5 kD. Like other type II keratins, KB20
has N- and C-terminal domains and a central rod domain consisting of 4
alpha-helical regions separated by 3 nonhelical linker sequences.
Northern blot analysis detected weak expression of a 3.5-kb KB20
transcript in tongue, but not skin or in any other tissues or organs
examined.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Rogers et al. (2005) mapped the KRT80 gene
to chromosome 12q13.13.

613022	TITLE *613022 OXOGLUTARATE DEHYDROGENASE; OGDH
;;ALPHA-KETOGLUTARATE DEHYDROGENASE; AKGDH;;
E1K
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex is a multienzyme complex
consisting of 3 protein subunits, oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, also known
as alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase or E1k (EC 1.2.4.2.), dihydrolipoyl
succinyltransferase (DLST, or E2k; 126063), and dihydrolipoyl
dehydrogenase (DLD, or E3; 238331). The complex catalyzes a key reaction
in the Krebs tricarboxylic acid cycle (summary by Szabo et al., 1994).

CLONING

Koike et al. (1992) cloned a human OGDH cDNA from a fetal liver cDNA
library. The ORF encodes a presequence of 40 amino acids and a mature
protein of 963 amino acids with a molecular mass of 108,642 daltons. It
is located in mitochondria within the inner membrane/matrix compartment.

GENE STRUCTURE

Koike (1995) found that the human OGDH gene contains 22 exons spanning
approximately 85 kb. All exon/intron splice junctions follow the GT/AG
rule. Primary extension analysis showed that the OGDH transcription
start point is a thymine residue 55 bp upstream from the ATG start
codon. The 5-prime-flanking region lacked canonical TATA or CAAT boxes.

MAPPING

Using 2 human/rodent somatic cell hybrid panels, Szabo et al. (1994)
mapped the OGDH gene to 7p13-p11.2. A second related sequence, possibly
a pseudogene, was identified and mapped to chromosome 10.

Using DNAs from human/rodent somatic cell hybrids in conjunction with
fluorescence in situ hybridization, Koike (1995) assigned the OGDH gene
to the boundary between bands 7p13 and 7p14.

GENE FUNCTION

Oxoglutarate dehydrogenase is a component of the enzyme complex that
catalyzes the conversion of 2-oxoglutarate to succinyl coenzyme A (Koike
et al., 1992).

Szabo et al. (1994) pointed to a possible significance to the finding of
a reduction in the activity of this complex in Alzheimer disease brain
and cultured skin fibroblasts from Alzheimer disease patients.

See 203740 for a discussion of alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase
deficiency.

608604	TITLE *608604 RETINOL-BINDING PROTEIN 7; RBP7
;;CELLULAR RETINOL-BINDING PROTEIN 4; CRBP4;;
CRBPIV
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Due to its chemical instability and low solubility in aqueous solution,
vitamin A requires cellular retinol-binding proteins (CRBPs), such as
RBP7, for stability, internalization, intercellular transfer,
homeostasis, and metabolism.

CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to CRBPs, Folli et
al. (2002) identified a full-length cDNA encoding RBP7, which they
called CRBPIV, from a lung carcinoma cDNA library. The deduced 134-amino
acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 15.5 kD. CRBPIV shares
57%, 58%, and 49% amino acid identity with CRBPI (RBP1; 180260), CRBPII
(RBP2; 180280), and CRBPIII (RBP5; 611866), respectively. RNA dot-blot
analysis detected CRBPIV in nearly all tissues and cell lines examined,
with highest abundance in adult kidney, followed by heart, transverse
colon, fetal heart, fetal spleen, lymph node, appendix, and ascending
colon.

GENE FUNCTION

Folli et al. (2002) demonstrated that recombinant CRBPIV bound
all-trans-retinol. CRBPIV showed a lower binding affinity for retinol
than those shown by other CRBPs, and the binding stoichiometry suggested
that about 0.5 retinol-binding sites were utilized per CRBPIV molecule.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Folli et al. (2002) determined the crystal structure of apo-CRBPIV to
2-angstrom resolution and found that the structure of CRBPIV was similar
to those of other CRBPs. The absorption spectrum of all-trans-retinol
bound to CRBPIV, however, was distinct from those of retinol bound to
other CRBPs, suggesting a different mode of vitamin binding.

GENE STRUCTURE

Folli et al. (2002) determined that the RBP7 gene contains 4 exons.

MAPPING

Folli et al. (2002) stated that the RBP7 gene maps to chromosome 1.

ANIMAL MODEL

Piantedosi et al. (2005) generated Rbp7-null mice that were viable and
healthy, but displayed impaired retinoid incorporation into milk during
lactation. They suggested that mouse Rbp7 plays a role in retinol
metabolism in the mammary gland.

602123	TITLE *602123 CALCIUM/CALMODULIN-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE II-GAMMA; CAMK2G
;;CaM KINASE II GAMMA SUBUNIT;;
CAMKG
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) is a
ubiquitous serine/threonine protein kinase that has been implicated in
diverse effects of hormones and neurotransmitters that utilize Ca(2+) as
a second messenger. The enzyme is an oligomeric protein composed of
distinct but related subunits, alpha (114078), beta (607707), gamma, and
delta (607708), each encoded by a separate gene. Each subunit has
alternatively spliced variants.

CLONING

Breen and Ashcroft (1997) cloned and sequenced a novel CaM kinase
II-gamma cDNA from human islet cell RNA. This isoform, designated
gamma-SRP by the authors, encodes a truncated gamma CaM kinase II in
which the 3-prime end consists of 804 basepairs of the human SRP72 gene
(602122).

Tombes and Krystal (1997) identified a number of CAMKG variants
expressed by neuronal cells. Two variants were consistently expressed in
nonneuronal cell lines, and another was preferentially expressed in
tumor cells.

MAPPING

Using somatic cell hybrid analysis and fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Li et al. (1994) mapped the CAMK2G gene to human
chromosome 10q22. Ahmed et al. (2001) stated that CAMK2G is 1 of 3 genes
that are nested in the introns of PCDH15 (605514).

GENE FUNCTION

In mouse cardiomyocytes, Zhu et al. (2003) demonstrated that
beta-1-adrenergic receptor (ADRB1; 109630)-induced apoptosis was
resistant to inhibition of PKA (see 176911). Rather, the Adrb1
proapoptotic effect was associated with non-Pka-dependent increases in
intracellular Ca(2+) and Camk2 activity. Blocking the L-type Ca(2+)
channel (see 114205), buffering intracellular Ca(2+), or inhibiting
Camk2 activity fully protected cardiomyocytes against Adrb1-induced
apoptosis; overexpressing the c splice variant of Camk2d markedly
exaggerated the Adrb1 apoptotic effect. Zhu et al. (2003) concluded that
CAMK2 constitutes a PKA-independent linkage of ADRB1 stimulation to
cardiomyocyte apoptosis.

Among 304 Swiss individuals tested and genotyped, de Quervain and
Papassotiropoulos (2006) found a significant association (p = 0.00008)
between short-term episodic memory performance and genetic variations in
a 7-gene cluster consisting of the ADCY8 (103070), PRKACG (176893),
CAMK2G, GRIN2A (138253), GRIN2B (138252), GRM3 (601115), and PRKCA
(176960) genes, all of which have well-established molecular and
biologic functions in animal memory. Functional MRI studies in an
independent set of 32 individuals with similar memory performance showed
a correlation between activation in memory-related brain regions,
including the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus, and genetic
variability in the 7-gene cluster. De Quervain and Papassotiropoulos
(2006) concluded that these 7 genes encode proteins of the memory
formation signaling cascade that are important for human memory
function.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

For discussion of mutation in the CAMK2G gene as a possible cause of an
intellectual disability phenotype, see 602123.0001.

ANIMAL MODEL

To study the role of CaMKII in T cells, Bui et al. (2000) generated
transgenic mice expressing a partially calcium-independent mutant form
of CAMKG (thr287 to asp). The size of the thymus was increased 1.5- to
2-fold in these mice, at least in part due to an increase in the life
span of double-positive thymocytes. There was an increase in the number
of T cells in the secondary lymphoid organs that had acquired an
antigen-dependent memory phenotype. These T cells were bona fide memory
cells as assessed by a variety of criteria. In addition, T cells from
wildtype mice acquired calcium-independent CaMKII activity after several
rounds of antigen-stimulated division. The authors proposed that CaMKII
controls a distinct process of activation-induced cellular
differentiation.

Using gene targeting, Zhang et al. (2005) developed a mouse model of
cardiac Camk2 inhibition and demonstrated substantial prevention of
maladaptive remodeling from excessive beta-adrenergic receptor
stimulation and myocardial infarction, and induction of balanced changes
in excitation-contraction coupling that preserved baseline and
beta-adrenergic receptor-stimulated physiologic increases in cardiac
function. Zhang et al. (2005) concluded that CAMK2 is a determinant of
clinically important heart disease phenotypes.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
CAMK2G, ARG292PRO

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to intellectual disability has not been confirmed.

In a boy with severe intellectual disability with self mutilation,
myopia, strabismus, mitochondrial dysfunction without mitochondrial gene
defects, short stature, flat face with narrow forehead, long palpebral
fissures, arched eyebrows, sacral dimple, short hands, brachydactyly,
and short feet, de Ligt et al. (2012) identified a de novo heterozygous
875G-C transversion resulting in an arg29-to-pro (R29P) substitution.
The patient had normal array and MLL2 testing.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The action of the T-cell growth factor interleukin-2 (IL2; 147680)
requires the presence of a cell surface receptor. As most peripheral as
well as thymic T cells do not carry the receptor in vivo, the regulated
expression of IL2R appears to be a safeguard against a catastrophic
spread of T-cell proliferation by an immunogenic stimulus. The receptor
is a heterodimer, consisting of 1 alpha and 1 beta chain; the beta chain
(146710) was not characterized until 1989. The receptor molecule, a
glycoprotein, has a relative mass of about 55,000. Its intracellular
precursor is smaller. Leonard et al. (1983) used a monoclonal antibody
for T-cell growth factor to characterize the receptor.

Leonard et al. (1984), Nikaido et al. (1984), and Cosman et al. (1984)
cloned the IL2R gene. Leonard et al. (1984) identified 1 gene but 2 IL2R
mRNAs that differ in their polyadenylation signals. They also isolated
an additional cDNA that may correspond to an alternatively spliced mRNA
that lacks a 216-bp segment and appears to encode an altered membrane
protein that cannot bind interleukin-2. Nikaido et al. (1984) determined
the primary structure of the precursor, which has 272 amino acid
residues.

Hatakeyama et al. (1985) provided evidence that the IL2 receptor is
generated, at least in part, by a single gene, namely, the gene encoding
Tac antigen (p55). Hatakeyama et al. (1986) used site-directed mutation
in the Tac antigen cDNA to generate a mutant receptor. Results of
expression studies led them to propose that a molecule that is
associated with but distinct from the Tac antigen is involved in the
regulation of the functional IL2R complex. Tsudo et al. (1986) arrived
at a similar conclusion on the basis of other studies.

Robb et al. (1988) employed further cytomutagenesis studies of the Tac
molecule to derive a correlation between the structure and function of
various components of the molecule. The Tac antigen represents the alpha
chain of IL2R, which binds IL2 with low affinity (Leonard et al., 1984;
Nikaido et al., 1984), whereas the beta chain by itself does not bind
IL2 when expressed in COS-7 cells. However, coexpression of the 2 chains
leads to the formation of a high-affinity receptor. The same situation
exists with the alpha and beta chains of the GM-CSF receptor (CSF2RA;
306250).

GENE STRUCTURE

Leonard et al. (1985) reported that the IL2R gene has 8 exons spanning
more than 25 kb. Ferrari et al. (1987) determined that exons 2 and 4 are
derived from a gene duplication event and also are homologous to the
recognition domain of factor B of the complement system (CFB; 138470).

MAPPING

Leonard et al. (1985) mapped the IL2R gene to 10p15-p14. Ferrari et al.
(1987) confirmed the assignment of IL2R to chromosome 10 by studies of
DNA from a rodent-human hybrid panel. By in situ hybridization, Webb et
al. (1990) assigned the Il-2ra gene to band A2-A3 of mouse chromosome 2.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Rickert et al. (2005) presented the 2.8-angstrom crystal structure of a
complex between human IL2 (147680) and IL2RA, which interact in a
docking mode distinct from that of other cytokine receptor complexes.
IL2RA is composed of strand-swapped 'sushi-like' domains, unlike the
classical cytokine receptor fold. As a result of this domain swap, IL2RA
uses a composite surface to dock into a groove on IL2 that also serves
as a binding site for antagonist drugs.

Wang et al. (2005) reported the crystal structure of the quaternary
complex of IL2 with IL2RA, IL2RB, and IL2RG at a resolution of 2.3
angstroms.

GENE FUNCTION

Lamaze et al. (2001) selectively blocked clathrin (see 118960)-dependent
endocytosis using dominant-negative mutants of EPS15 (600051) and showed
that clathrin-mediated endocytosis of transferrin (190000) was
inhibited, while endocytosis of the IL2Rs proceeded normally.
Ultrastructural and biochemical experiments showed that
clathrin-independent endocytosis of IL2Rs exists constitutively in
lymphocytes and is coupled to their association with detergent-resistant
membrane domains. The authors found that clathrin-independent
endocytosis requires dynamin (see 602377) and is specifically regulated
by Rho family GTPases (see 604980). These results defined novel
properties of receptor-mediated endocytosis and established that IL2R is
efficiently internalized through this clathrin-independent pathway.

Ihle and Kerr (1995) reviewed the activation cascade involving
cytokines, IL2RA and other cytokine receptors, the Janus kinases (see
JAK1; 147795), and the signal transducers and activators of
transcription, or STATs (see STAT1; 600555).

In a commentary, Shevach (2001) noted that the transfer into
immunocompromised mice of CD4 (186940)-positive T cells from which a
subpopulation coexpressing CD25 had been removed induced organ-specific
autoimmune disease in most recipients (Ansano et al., 1996). The
CD4-positive/CD25-positive population was solely responsible for the
prevention of this autoimmunity. Shevach (2001) cited a number of
publications that had confirmed the importance of these cells in the
regulation of immune responses in human models. All the studies appeared
to show that the suppression involves a cell contact-dependent,
cytokine-independent mechanism after activation of the
CD4-positive/CD25-positive T cells.

Due to similarities between the autoimmunity and inflammation produced
by manipulation of CD25-positive/CD4-positive regulatory T (Tr) cells
and those induced by genetic defects in the FOXP3 gene (300292), Hori et
al. (2003) investigated the contribution of Foxp3 to the development
and/or function of Tr cells in mice. RT-PCR analysis of normal mice
showed stable, constitutive expression of Foxp3 that was high in Tr
cells, low in CD4-positive/CD25-negative cells, and absent in
CD4-negative/CD8-positive T cells. Transduced expression of Foxp3 in
CD4-positive/CD25-negative cells imparted a Tr phenotype in these cells,
with low levels of cytokine expression, compared with nontransduced or
vector-only transduced cells, and high levels of CD103 (604682), GITR
(TNFRSF18; 603905), and CTLA4 (123890). Transduced cells also showed
cell-cell contact suppressive activity in vitro, as well as suppression
of autoimmunity and inflammation in vivo. Hori et al. (2003) proposed
that FOXP3 may be a master regulatory gene and a more specific marker of
Tr cells than other cell surface molecules. They also suggested that
FOXP3 transduction could be a therapeutic mode for the treatment of
inflammatory diseases.

Pasare and Medzhitov (2003) found that microbial induction of dendritic
cell (DC) maturation by activation of Toll-like receptors (e.g., TLR4;
603030) abrogated the suppressive effects of CD25-positive/CD4-positive
Tr cells. The blockade of Tr cell-mediated suppression was independent
of costimulatory molecule expression on DCs. Stimulation of the
TLR/MYD88 (602170) pathway in DCs led to the expression of IL6 (147620)
and, most likely, other secreted factors that do not signal through the
common gamma chain (IL2RG; 308380), and these mediated the block of
suppression. Il6-deficient mice were severely compromised in the
induction of effector T-cell responses, and this defect could be
transiently overcome by depletion of Tr cells. Pasare and Medzhitov
(2003) concluded that the failure of Il6-deficient mice to overcome
Tr-mediated suppression resulted in increased susceptibility to
infection and resistance to autoimmunity. In a commentary, Powrie and
Maloy (2003) proposed a model for the control of Tr development by
innate immune cells and noted that the targeting of IL6 may be an
attractive treatment for inflammatory diseases.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Sharfe et al. (1997) identified a 4-bp deletion in the CD25 gene,
resulting in a frameshift in protein translation (147730.0001), in a
patient with IL2RA deficiency (606367).

By using a haplotype tag SNP approach, Vella et al. (2005) tested type 1
diabetes (222100) sample collections consisting of 7,457 cases and
controls and of 725 multiplex families. Tag SNPs were analyzed using a
multilocus test to provide a regional test for association. They found
strong statistical evidence in the case-control collection for a type 1
diabetes locus in the CD25 region of chromosome 10p15 (see IDDM10;
601942) and replicated the association in the family collection. Vella
et al. (2005) recognized that association might not be with CD25 itself,
but rather with a causal variant in linkage disequilibrium with CD25.

In an analysis of up to 5,312 individuals with type 1 diabetes and 6,855
controls, Lowe et al. (2007) localized the type 1 diabetes association
in the IL2RA gene region to 2 independent groups of SNPs, spanning
overlapping regions of 14 and 40 kb, encompassing IL2RA intron 1 and the
5-prime regions of IL2RA and flanking gene RBM17 (606935) (odds ratio =
2.04; P = 10(-28)). IL2RA type 1 diabetes susceptibility genotypes were
associated with lower circulating levels of soluble IL2RA (p = 6.28 x
10(-28)), suggesting that an inherited lower immune responsiveness
predisposes to type 1 diabetes.

For discussion of a possible association between variation in the IL2RA
gene and multiple sclerosis, see MS2 (612594).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
INTERLEUKIN 2 RECEPTOR, ALPHA, DEFICIENCY OF
IL2RA, 4-BP DEL, NT60

In a patient with severe immunodeficiency (606367), who was subsequently
treated with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, Sharfe et al.
(1997) found homozygosity for a 4-bp deletion in the IL2RA gene at
nucleotides 60 to 64, resulting in a translational frameshift.
Translation proceeded for 20 amino acids before the deletion and
resultant frameshift occurred, effectively ablating CD25 expression. A
further 25 irrelevant amino acids were added before termination. The
homozygous nature of the mutation was confirmed by analysis of sequences
from the parents, who both demonstrated a normal and a 4-bp-deleted
allele.

IL2RA, C-A (dbSNP rs41295061)

In an analysis of 5,312 individuals with type 1 diabetes (IDDM10;
601942) and 6,855 controls, Lowe et al. (2007) found that a SNP in the
IL2RA gene, dbSNP ss52580101, was the most associated SNP in a 40-kb
region encompassing IL2RA intron 1 and the 5-prime regions of IL2RA and
RBM17 (606935) (P = 3.37 x 10(-20)). The submitted SNP dbSNP ss52580101
has been assigned the refSNP identifier dbSNP rs41295061.

.0003
DIABETES MELLITUS, INSULIN-DEPENDENT, 10
IL2RA, T-A (dbSNP rs11594656)

Lowe et al. (2007) found by logistic regression analysis that a SNP in
intron 1 of IL2RA, dbSNP rs11594656, added significantly to the effect
of dbSNP ss52580101 (147730.0002) on susceptibility to type 1 diabetes
(IDDM10; 601942) (P = 8.19 x 10(-7)). Determination of soluble IL2RA
concentration (sIL2RA) for 1,357 case plasma samples found significant
association of dbSNP rs11594656 with sIL2RA (P = 2.15 x 10(-23)). The
presence of 2 copies of the susceptibility allele (T) was associated
with lower concentrations of sIL2RA compared with the presence of 1 or
more copies of the protective allele (A).

;;GAGE2
DESCRIPTION See GAGE1 (300594) for more information about the GAGE gene cluster.

CLONING

Human melanoma cells express several distinct antigens that are
recognized by autologous cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTLs). One class of
these antigens is encoded by genes, such as MAGE1 (MAGEA1; 300016),
MAGE3 (MAGEA3; 300174), and BAGE (605167), that are expressed in a large
fraction of tumors of various histologic types but are silent in normal
adult tissues, except for testis. Van den Eynde et al. (1995) identified
GAGE1 as a gene encoding an antigen that is present on melanoma MZ2-MEL
cells and is recognized by autologous CTLs. By screening a melanoma
MZ2-MEL cDNA library with a GAGE1 cDNA, they isolated cDNAs representing
5 genes with sequence similarity to GAGE1. They named the genes GAGE2,
GAGE3 (300596), GAGE4 (300597), GAGE5 (300598), and GAGE6 (300599). The
GAGE2 to -6 cDNAs differ mainly by single nucleotide substitutions that
are scattered throughout the sequence. The deduced GAGE2 protein has 116
amino acids. The authors defined the antigenic peptide encoded by GAGE1
and found that GAGE2 also encodes it. RT-PCR using primers common to
GAGE1 to -6 found no expression of these genes in any normal adult
tissue tested except testis. RT-PCR using primers specific to both GAGE1
and GAGE2 found that at least 1 of these genes was expressed in 25% of
sarcomas, 24% of melanomas, 19% of nonsmall cell lung carcinomas, 19% of
head and neck tumors, and 12% of bladder tumors; GAGE1 and GAGE2 were
not expressed in colorectal carcinomas and renal cell carcinomas.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gjerstorff and Ditzel (2008) stated that the GAGE2C gene is contained
within a 9.5-kb GAGE repeat. It contains 5 exons that span about 6.3 kb,
and it has a LINE insertion that disrupts 1 exon compared with GAGE1.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis and FISH, De Backer et al. (1999) mapped
the GAGE2C gene to chromosome Xp11.4-p11.2.

By genomic sequence analysis, Gjerstorff and Ditzel (2008) mapped the
GAGE2C gene to a GAGE gene cluster on chromosome Xp11.23.

147360	TITLE *147360 INVOLUCRIN; IVL
DESCRIPTION The crosslinked envelope of the keratinocyte is formed in the last stage
of its terminal differentiation. This envelope is made up of membrane
and cytosolic proteins crosslinked by glutamyl lysine isopeptide bonds.
The most abundant component is involucrin, a keratinocyte protein that
appears first in the cytoplasm but ultimately becomes crosslinked to
membrane proteins by transglutaminase. Eckert and Green (1986) cloned
the involucrin gene and studied its structure and evolution. The gene
consists of 585 amino acids, 390 of which form a central decapeptide
repeat, rich in glutamine and glutamic acid. Teumer and Green (1989)
described the divergent evolution of the IVL gene in gorilla and human.
Green and Djian (1992) reviewed the alterations in the involucrin gene
during evolution of primates from nonprimates. As reflected in the 17
species examined, the changes involved short tandem repeats. Evolution
of the IVL gene took place through mechanisms that shortened the length
of the repeats, increased their number, and changed their codon
sequence. As part of this trend, one entire segment of repeats was
replaced by another located elsewhere in the coding region.

Stroh et al. (1987) used a genomic clone to probe a panel of
human-rodent somatic cell hybrids and map the involucrin gene to
chromosome 1. By in situ hybridization using the same probe, maximal
hybridization was observed to bands 1q21-q22, with weak hybridization to
1p35-p36. They concluded that band 1q21 is the most likely location of
the IVL gene. Simon et al. (1989) presented the data for mapping of the
IVL gene. They also described a PstI RFLP, which they demonstrated in 1
individual to be the absence of 39 repeats that make up two-thirds of
the coding region of the IVL gene. Simon et al. (1991) gave further
information on the polymorphism in the coding region in the involucrin
gene in higher primates, which results from the variable number of
tandem repeats (VNTR) of a 10-codon sequence. Confirmation of the
localization of the IVL gene to 1q21 was provided by Volz et al. (1993),
who demonstrated physical linkage within 2.05 Mb of DNA to several other
genes involved in epidermal differentiation and known to be located in
that area.

Green (1993) pointed to the relevance of the expanded poly(CAG) in the
coding region of genes leading to 3 disorders: spinal and bulbar
muscular atrophy (313200), Huntington disease (143100), and
spinocerebellar ataxia type I (164400). Multiple glutamine residues,
usually encoded by CAG, are necessary for the crosslinking of involucrin
to other proteins by the keratinocyte transglutaminase during terminal
differentiation in the keratinocytes with formation of the insoluble
envelope of the corneocyte. Reiteration of the CAG codon appears to be
very frequent. Of all the animal and plant protein sequences in 2
databases, Green (1993) found that 33 contained a sequence of 16 or more
reiterated glutamines, but not one contained a run of more than 38
glutamines; hence, all showed a number of repeats lower than that in the
abnormal alleles of the 3 human diseases of CAG reiteration. Therefore,
reiteration must in some way be restricted in order to prevent genomic
havoc.

The IVL gene has evolved rapidly in higher primates (Green and Djian,
1992). Djian et al. (1995) observed that, although all mammalian IVL
genes examined to date possess a segment of short tandem repeats in the
coding region, the higher primates possess a segment of repeats that is
different from that of other mammals. This segment has enlarged
progressively mainly in the region not far from the 5-prime end of the
segment of repeats. The site of recent repeat additions is located in
the late region, which is polymorphic with respect to number of repeats
in most higher primates, including the human. The repeat pattern in the
late region of the human IVL gene does not resemble that of other
hominoids. Caucasians and Africans were found by Simon et al. (1991) and
by Urquhart and Gill (1993) to differ in repeat patterns within this
region and at certain nucleotide positions. Djian et al. (1995) observed
that there are over 8 polymorphic forms based on the number and kind of
10-codon tandem repeats in that part of the coding region most recently
added in the human lineage. The IVL alleles of Caucasians and Africans
differ both in nucleotide sequence and repeat patterns. Djian et al.
(1995) showed that the IVL alleles in East Asians (Chinese and Japanese)
can be divided into 2 populations according to whether they possess the
2 marker nucleotides typical of Africans or Caucasians. The Asian
population bearing Caucasian-type marker nucleotides had repeat patterns
similar to those of Caucasians, whereas Asians bearing African-type
marker nucleotides had repeat patterns resembling those of Africans more
than those of Caucasians. The existence of 2 populations of East Asian
IVL alleles gave support for the existence of a Eurasian stem lineage
from which Caucasians and a part of the Asian population originated.

Lopez-Bayghen et al. (1996) characterized the 5-prime noncoding region
of IVL and concluded that the region contains a distal
CaCl(2)-responsive enhancer, a putative transcriptional silencer, and a
proximal enhancer.

;;ACTIVATOR 1, 140-KD SUBUNIT;;
REPLICATION FACTOR C, 140-KD SUBUNIT; RFC140;;
RFC
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Replication factor C is a multisubunit, DNA polymerase accessory protein
required for the coordinated synthesis of both DNA strands during simian
virus 40 DNA replication in vitro. It is a DNA-dependent ATPase that
binds in a structure-specific manner to the 3-prime end of a primer
hybridized to a template DNA, an activity thought intrinsic to the
140-kD component of this multisubunit complex. Bunz et al. (1993)
isolated and analyzed cDNAs encoding the 140-kD subunit. An open reading
frame of 3.4 kb was predicted to encode a 1,148-amino acid protein with
a predicted molecular mass of 130 kD. A putative ATP-binding motif was
observed that is similar to a motif in several of the smaller subunits
of RFC and in functionally homologous replication factors of bacterial
and viral origin. The predicted protein showed similarities to other
DNA-binding proteins.

Luckow et al. (1994) isolated a full-length mouse cDNA encoding a
protein that binds in a sequence-unspecific manner to DNA, is localized
exclusively in the nucleus, and represents, they concluded, the 140-kD
subunit of mouse replication factor C. They found that it showed 83%
identity to the human protein.

Human replication factor C (RFC), also called activator-1, is a
multimeric primer-recognition protein consisting of 5 distinct subunits
of 145, 40, 38, 37, and 36.5 kD. Human RFC was purified from extracts of
HeLa cells as a host factor essential for the in vitro replication of
simian virus 40 (SV40) DNA (Okumura et al., 1995). RFC, in the presence
of ATP, assembles proliferating-cell nuclear antigen (PCNA; 176740) and
DNA polymerase-delta (174761) or polymerase-epsil on (174762) on primed
DNA templates. The complex of primed DNA-RFC-PCNA-DNA polymerase, when
supplemented with dNTPs, results in the efficient elongation of DNA in
the presence of human single-stranded DNA binding protein. Studies with
the complete 5-subunit holoenzyme indicated that the large subunit binds
to DNA and the 40-kD subunit binds ATP. The other subunits may play
discrete roles in the elongation process catalyzed by polymerase. The
subunit genes are numbered in sequence of decreasing molecular weight:
RFC1, RFC2 (600404), RFC3 (600405), RFC4 (102577), and RFC5 (600407).

GENE FUNCTION

Using interaction cloning, Uchiumi et al. (1996) found that the large
subunit of RFC interacts with the DNA sequence repeats of telomeres.
They found that RFC recognizes the 5-prime-phosphate termini of
double-stranded telomeric repeats. The authors suggested that RFC may be
involved in telomere stability or turnover.

Wang et al. (2000) used immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry
analyses to identify BRCA1 (113705)-associated proteins. They found that
BRCA1 is part of a large multisubunit protein complex of tumor
suppressors, DNA damage sensors, and signal transducers. They named this
complex BASC, for 'BRCA1-associated genome surveillance complex.' Among
the DNA repair proteins identified in the complex were ATM (607585), BLM
(604610), MSH2 (609309), MSH6 (600678), MLH1 (120436), the RAD50
(604040)-MRE11 (600814)-NBS1 (602667) complex, and the RFC1-RFC2
(600404)-RFC4 (102577) complex. Wang et al. (2000) suggested that BASC
may serve as a sensor of abnormal DNA structures and/or as a regulator
of the postreplication repair process.

The RB1 protein (614041) promotes cell survival after DNA damage.
Pennaneach et al. (2001) showed that the LxCxE-binding site in RB1
mediates both cell survival and cell cycle arrest after DNA damage. RFC
complex plays an important role in DNA replication. Pennaneach et al.
(2001) described a function of RFC1 in promoting cell survival after DNA
damage. RFC1 contains an LxCxE motif, and mutation of this motif
abolished the protective effect of RFC1. The inability of wildtype RFC1
to promote cell survival in RB1 null cells was rescued by RB1 but not by
RB1 mutants defective in binding LxCxE proteins. RFC thus enhances cell
survival after DNA damage in an RB1-dependent manner.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Bowman et al. (2004) reported the crystal structure of the 5-protein
clamp loader complex (replication factor-C, RFC) of the yeast S.
cerevisiae, bound to the sliding clamp (proliferating cell nuclear
antigen, or PCNA). Tight interfacial coordination of the ATP analog
ATP-gamma-S by RFC resulted in a spiral arrangement of the ATPase
domains of the clamp loader above the PCNA ring. Placement of a model
for primed DNA within the central hole of PCNA revealed a striking
correspondence between the RFC spiral and the grooves of the DNA double
helix. Bowman et al. (2004) concluded that this model, in which the
clamp loader complex locks into primed DNA in a screwcap-like
arrangement, provides a simple explanation for the process by which the
engagement of primer-template junctions by the RFC:PCNA complex results
in ATP hydrolysis and release of the sliding clamp on DNA.

MAPPING

Luckow et al. (1994) assigned RFC1, the gene for the largest subunit of
replication factor C, to 4p14-p13 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.
They mapped the homolog in the mouse to chromosome 5. Lossie et al.
(1995) likewise mapped this gene, which they symbolized Recc1, to human
chromosome 4 by human/rodent somatic cell hybrid analysis and to mouse
chromosome 5 by haplotype analysis of an interspecific backcross.

603360	TITLE *603360 PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS FACTOR 16; PEX16
;;PEROXIN 16
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Honsho et al. (1998) isolated a human PEX16 cDNA by performing an
expressed sequence tag (EST) homology search on a human DNA database and
by using yeast PEX16 from Yarrowia lipolytica to screen a human liver
cDNA library. This cDNA was found to encode a peroxisomal protein,
peroxin 16, that contains 336 amino acids. Among 13
peroxisome-deficiency complementation groups, PEX16 expression
morphologically and biochemically restored peroxisome biogenesis only in
fibroblasts from a case of Zellweger syndrome of the complementation
group referred to as CGD in Japan and CG9 in the United States. PEX16
was localized to peroxisomes through expression study of epitope-labeled
PEX16 protein.

South and Gould (1999) characterized wildtype PEX16 and found that it
has an apparent molecular mass of about 38 kD by SDS/PAGE. Sequence
analysis revealed 2 transmembrane domains, 1 spanning amino acids
110-144 and another spanning amino acids 222-243. Protease protection
experiments revealed a membrane orientation where the N- and C-termini
extend into the cytoplasm and the intermembrane loop is protected within
the peroxisome lumen.

GENE FUNCTION

South and Gould (1999) found that fibroblasts from the patient carrying
the R176X mutation (603360.0001) were unable to import PMP70 (170995)
into peroxisomes. Transfection and overexpression of wildtype PEX16 did
not induce peroxisome proliferation, but restored PMP70 import. The
authors concluded that PEX16-mediated formation of peroxisomes does not
require the division of preexisting peroxisomes. By characterizing
various truncation mutants, Honsho et al. (2002) determined that a
positively charged region (amino acids 66-81) and the first
transmembrane domain are required for peroxisome targeting of PEX16. The
C-terminal cytoplasmically exposed region of PEX16 functioned in
peroxisome formation. Transfection and overexpression of the R176X
mutation interfered with membrane protein transport.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In the study by Honsho et al. (1998), one patient with a peroxisomal
biogenesis disorder was found to have a homozygous nonsense mutation
(603360.0001) in the PEX16 gene.

In 6 patients, including 2 sibs, with a relatively mild form of
Zellweger syndrome characterized by early-childhood onset of progressive
spastic paraparesis and ataxia with progressive leukodystrophy and brain
atrophy on brain MRI, Ebberink et al. (2010) identified 5 different
homozygous mutations in the PEX16 gene (see, e.g.,
603360.0003-603360.0005). Studies of skin fibroblasts showed that
peroxisomes were markedly enlarged in size and reduced in number
compared to controls. However, biochemical studies showed only mild
abnormalities, such as increased very-long-chain fatty acids, and
increased bile acid intermediates or increased branched chain fatty
acids in some. Phytanic acid alpha-oxidation, pristanic acid
beta-oxidation, and red cell plasmalogen were normal. Peroxisomal
enzymes were normal, and the peroxisomes were import-competent.
Expression of wildtype PEX16 restored the number and size of peroxisomes
in patient fibroblasts to normal. Expression of mutant PEX16 in
PEX16-null cells resulted in enlarged peroxisomes in about 30% of cells,
indicating some residual activity. Ebberink et al. (2010) emphasized
that even though PEX16 is involved in peroxisomal membrane assembly,
PEX16 defects can present with a relatively mild phenotype showing
import-competent peroxisomes in fibroblasts.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 8A (ZELLWEGER)
PEX16, ARG176TER

In fibroblasts from a patient with Zellweger syndrome of complementation
group D (PBD8A; 614876), purchased from the NIGMS Human Genetic Mutant
Cell Repository (CCR GM06231), Honsho et al. (1998) demonstrated
deficiency of peroxin-16 and a nonsense mutation in the PEX16 gene: a
C-to-T transition at nucleotide 526, resulting in a change of codon 176
from CGA (arg) to TGA (stop).

.0002
PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 8A (ZELLWEGER)
PEX16, IVSDS10, T-C, +2

Shimozawa et al. (2002) identified a homozygous splice site mutation
(IVS10+2T-C) in 2 complementation group D patients (PBD8A; 614876),
causing exon 10 deletion and changing the amino acid sequence starting
from codon 298, introducing a termination codon at position 336.

.0003
PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 8B
PEX16, 1-BP DEL, 984G

In 2 sibs, born of consanguineous Turkish parents, with a peroxisomal
biogenesis disorder (PBD8B; 614877), Ebberink et al. (2010) identified a
homozygous 1-bp deletion (984delG) in exon 11a of the PEX16 gene,
resulting in a frameshift and premature protein truncation. Exon 11b was
unaffected. Both patients presented between age 1 and 2 years with
delayed walking and frequent falls after normal initial development. The
disorder was progressive, characterized by lower limb spasticity and
ataxia resulting in wheelchair-dependence in the first decade. Studies
of skin fibroblasts showed that peroxisomes were markedly enlarged in
size and reduced in number compared to controls. However, biochemical
studies showed only mild abnormalities, such as increased
very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA), increased bile acid intermediates,
and increased branched chain fatty acids (only found in 1 sib).
Expression of wildtype PEX16 restored the number and size of peroxisomes
in patient fibroblasts to normal. Ebberink et al. (2010) emphasized that
even though PEX16 is involved in peroxisomal membrane assembly, PEX16
defects can present with a relatively mild phenotype showing
import-competent peroxisomes in fibroblasts.

.0004
PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 8B
PEX16, TYR331CYS

In a girl with a relatively mild type of peroxisomal biogenesis disorder
(PBD8B; 614877), Ebberink et al. (2010) identified a homozygous 992A-G
transition in exon 11a of the PEX16 gene, resulting in a tyr331-to-cys
(Y331C) substitution. She developed an ataxic gait at age 2 years, after
normal initial development except for delayed walking. At age 6 years,
she had mild cognitive impairment, moderate dysarthria, and abnormal eye
saccades. Brain MRI showed widespread white matter changes on a
background pattern of global delay in myelin maturation, and reduced
cerebellar volume. Similar MRI findings were observed in her younger
sister. Studies of skin fibroblasts showed that peroxisomes were
markedly enlarged in size and reduced in number compared to controls.
However, biochemical studies showed only mild abnormalities, such as
increased VLCFA, but most other peroxisomal functions appeared normal.

.0005
PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 8B
PEX16, DEL, EX11

In an Indian girl, born of consanguineous parents, with a relatively
mild type of peroxisomal biogenesis disorder (PBD8B; 614877), Ebberink
et al. (2010) identified a homozygous large intragenic deletion of
intron 10 and exon 11 of the PEX16 gene. In transcript variant 1, the
deletion affected the last 468 base pairs of intron 10, the entire exon
11a, and the first 80 base pairs of the 3-prime flanking region of exon
11a. In transcript variant 2, the deletion affected the last 603 base
pairs of intron 10, and the first 4 base pairs of exon 11b. The deletion
resulted in 3 alternative splice products. She showed normal development
for the first year of life, but then stopped acquiring new skills, and
lost her ability to walk independently at age 24 months due to
spasticity and mild ataxia. Her speech and other cognitive functions
also deteriorated slowly over time. At the age of 5 years, she had
nystagmus, cataracts, hyperreflexia, clonus, and extensor plantar
responses. Brain imaging showed diffuse white matter abnormalities and
focal atrophy of the cerebellum and corpus callosum. Peripheral nerve
velocity studies of the lower limbs suggested demyelination. Studies of
skin fibroblasts showed that the peroxisomes were markedly enlarged in
size and reduced in number compared to controls. However, biochemical
studies showed only mild abnormalities, such as increased VLCFA, but
most other peroxisomal functions appeared normal.

102772	TITLE *102772 ADENOSINE MONOPHOSPHATE DEAMINASE 3; AMPD3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Adenosine monophosphate deaminase-3 (EC 3.5.4.6) catalyzes the
deamination of AMP to IMP in red cells and plays an important role in
the purine nucleotide cycle. The AMPD3 gene encodes 2 erythrocyte
isoforms, E1 and E2. An inherited defect in AMPD3 results in combined
deficiency of these isoforms.

Also see AMPD1 (102770) and AMPD2 (102771), which encode the L (liver)
and M (muscle) isoforms of AMP deaminase, respectively.

CLONING

Mahnke-Zizelman and Sabina (1992) isolated several AMPD3 cDNAs from
different human nonskeletal muscle cDNA libraries. The cDNAs differed in
their 5-prime terminal sequences.

Yamada et al. (1992) also cloned a human AMPD3 cDNA. The 3.7-kb cDNA
contains an open reading frame of 2,301 bp that encodes a deduced
767-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 89 kD.

Mahnke-Zizelman et al. (1996) reported that the AMPD3 gene is widely
expressed in human tissues and cells and that its expression is subject
to transcriptional control by 3 tandem promoters. The AMPD3 transcripts
encode the E isoforms of AMP deaminase.

Mahnke-Zizelman et al. (1997) demonstrated that rat isoform C and human
isoform E are homologous cross-species AMPD3 proteins.

GENE STRUCTURE

Mahnke-Zizelman et al. (1996) demonstrated that the AMPD3 gene contains
17 exons spanning approximately 60 kb. They identified multiple
promoters in proximal flanking sequence 5-prime to exons 1a, 1b, and 1c
that regulate the production of alternative AMPD3 transcripts.
Alternative splicing occurs in exon 1c.

MAPPING

Whereas both the AMPD1 and AMPD2 genes are situated in the 1p21-p13
region of chromosome 1, Eddy et al. (1993) demonstrated that the AMPD3
gene is located on chromosome 11 in the region pter-p13.

Sermsuvitayawong et al. (1997) demonstrated that the Ampd3 gene is
located on mouse chromosome 7 in a region of conserved linkage homology
with human 11p. The mouse homolog, however, has a different gene
structure in the 5-prime region, the gene products are reported to be
immunologically distinct, and Sermsuvitayawong et al. (1997) referred to
the Ampd3 gene as the heart-type AMPD.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 of the Japanese individuals with erythrocyte AMP deficiency
(612874) reported by Ogasawara et al. (1987), Yamada et al. (1994)
identified a mutation in the AMPD3 gene (102772.0001).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ERYTHROCYTE AMP DEAMINASE DEFICIENCY
AMPD3, ARG573CYS

In 2 individuals with complete deficiency of erythrocyte AMP deaminase
(612874), Yamada et al. (1994) identified homozygosity for a 1717C-T
transition in the AMPD3 gene, resulting in an amino acid change of arg
to cys at codon 573 (R573C). Two individuals with partial deficiency of
the enzyme were found to be heterozygous for the mutation. The mutation
resulted in a catalytically inactive enzyme.

Among 45 Japanese individuals with partial erythrocyte AMP deaminase
deficiency, Yamada et al. (1994) found that all but 16 were heterozygous
for the R573C mutation; 2 individuals with complete deficiency were
homozygous for the mutation. They concluded that this mutation accounts
for 75% of erythrocyte AMP deaminase deficiency in Japan.

RED BLOOD CELL ANTIGEN MER 2; MER2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Transmembrane 4 (4TM) superfamily proteins are membrane proteins with 4
conserved transmembrane domains. Fitter et al. (1995) showed that the
platelet surface glycoprotein gp27 identified by Ashman et al. (1991) is
a member of this group. Fitter et al. (1995) cloned the gp27 gene,
designated PETA3 by them, by sequencing purified protein and using the
resulting probes in RT-PCR to obtain a cDNA from megakaryoblastic cells.
Fitter et al. (1995) assigned this 253-amino acid protein to the 4TM
group because it has 4 predicted hydrophobic regions and 30% homology to
other members of the group. Northern blot analysis showed that PETA3 is
expressed in most tissues, but not in brain. Hasegawa et al. (1996)
cloned the same gene, which they named SFA1, during a screen for genes
induced by HTLV-1 transformation in T cells. The 62-bp difference
between the 5-prime untranslated regions of the PETA3 and SFA1 cDNAs was
ascribed to alternative splicing in an erratum to Hasegawa et al.
(1996).

Bill et al. (1987) cloned the MER2 (179620) gene using a strategy that
involved cotransfection of resistance to an antibiotic.

GENE FUNCTION

Hemidesmosomes are specialized junctional complexes that function as
cell-attachment sites for binding to basement membranes. They appear as
electron-dense structures, resembling half a desmosome. Alpha-6 (ITGA6;
147556)/beta-4 (ITGB4; 147557) integrin is a major component of
hemidesmosomes. In addition to ITGA6/ITGB4, classic type I
hemidesmosomes contain BP180 (COL17A1; 113811) and BP230 (BPAG1;
113810), while type II hemidesmosomes, which are found in cylindrical
epithelia, contain plectin (601282). Using immunohistochemistry and
immunoelectron microscopy, Sterk et al. (2000) identified CD151, but not
the tetraspanins CD9 (143030) or CD81 (186845), codistributed with
ITGA6/ITGB4 in hemidesmosomes but not desmosomes at the basolateral
surfaces of basal keratinocytes. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot
analysis showed that CD151 associates with ITGA6/ITGB4 and with ITGA3
(605025)/ITGB1 (135630), but not with ITGA5 (135620)/ITGB1. In pyloric
atresia-junctional epidermolysis bullosa (PA-JEB; 226730) cells lacking
ITGB4 (thus lacking hemidesmosomes), CD151 colocalized with ITGA3/ITGB1.
Expression of ITGB4 in PA-JEB cells induced surface expression of
ITGA6/ITGB4 in hemidesmosomes together with CD151 and the apparent
replacement of ITGA3/ITGB1. Fluorescent microscopy showed that CD151 is
a component of both type I and type II hemidesmosomes. The authors
demonstrated that recruitment of CD151 requires the heterodimerization
of ITGB4 with ITGA6, with which CD151 is associated.

The 4-transmembrane domain superfamily (the tetraspanins) are integral
cell membrane proteins comprising at least 28 members in mammals.
Tetraspanins are widely distributed on animal cells, and several are
known to be expressed on human hematopoietic cells, including CD151.
Tetraspanin CD151 forms very stable laminin-binding complexes with
integrins alpha-3-beta-1 (605025; 135630) and alpha-6-beta-1 (147556;
135630) in kidney and alpha-3-beta-1 and alpha-6-beta-4 (147558; 147557)
in skin. Karamatic Crew et al. (2004) demonstrated that CD151 expresses
the MER2 blood group antigen and is located on erythrocytes.

CD151 is highly expressed in megakaryocytes and, to a lesser extent, in
platelets. Using Cd151-deficient mice, Lau et al. (2004) provided the
first direct evidence that CD151 is essential for normal platelet
function and that disruption of CD151 induces a moderate outside-in
integrin alpha-IIb-beta-3 (see 607759, 173470) signaling defect.

GENE STRUCTURE

By PCR and genomic sequence analyses, Whittock and McLean (2001)
determined that the CD151 gene contains 8 exons spanning 4.3 kb, with
exons 2 to 8 encoding the CD151 protein. They also described a PCR-based
mutation-detection strategy to facilitate identification of pathogenic
mutations in patients with fragile skin and mucous membranes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Karamatic Crew et al. (2004) studied the CD151 gene in 3 patients who
were negative for the blood group antigen MER2 (179620), which is
expressed by the CD151 tetraspanin. The patients were of Indian Jewish
origin and had end-stage kidney disease. In addition to hereditary
nephritis, the sibs had sensorineural deafness, pretibial epidermolysis
bullosa, and beta-thalassemia minor. All 3 patients were homozygous for
a single-nucleotide insertion in exon 5 of CD151, causing a frameshift
and premature stop signal at codon 140 (602243.0001). The resultant
truncated protein would lack its integrin-binding domain. Karamatic Crew
et al. (2004) concluded that CD151 is essential for the proper assembly
of the glomerular and tubular basement membrane in kidney, has
functional significance in the skin, is probably a component of the
inner ear, and could play a role in erythropoiesis, as suggested by the
presence of beta-thalassemia minor.

MAPPING

Hasegawa et al. (1997) mapped the PETA3 gene to 11p15.5 by fluorescence
in situ hybridization. Whittock and McLean (2001) confirmed that the
CD151 gene maps to 11p15.5 by radiation hybrid analysis.

Daniels et al. (1987) assigned the MER2 locus to 11p15 by study of
somatic cell hybrids.

ANIMAL MODEL

Wright et al. (2004) generated mice with a homozygous deletion of all 6
coding exons of the Cd151 gene. The Cd151 -/- mice were viable, fertile,
and healthy, with normal blood and marrow cell counts and normal tissue
morphology and integrin expression in skin. However, the mice had a
minor abnormality in hemostasis, with longer bleeding times, greater
blood loss, and increased incidence of spontaneous tail vein rebleeding.
Cd151 -/- keratinocytes migrated poorly in skin explant cultures, and
mutant lymphocytes were hyperproliferative after mitogen stimulation in
vitro. Wright et al. (2004) noted that other tetraspanin deletion
mutants produce mild phenotypes and suggested that this may be due to
complementation by other tetraspanins or that these proteins function as
modifiers rather than as essential components of the molecular complexes
in which they participate.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
NEPHROPATHY WITH PRETIBIAL EPIDERMOLYSIS BULLOSA AND DEAFNESS
CD151, 1-BP INS, G383

In 3 MER2-negative patients of Indian Jewish origin with end-stage
kidney disease (609057), Karamatic Crew et al. (2004) found homozygosity
for a single-nucleotide insertion (G383) in exon 5 of the CD151 gene,
causing a frameshift and premature stop signal in codon 140. The
resultant truncated protein would lack its integrin-binding domain. The
findings suggested that CD151 is essential for the proper assembly of
the glomerular and tubular basement membrane in kidney, as well as
having functional significance in skin and probably the inner ear.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Archipelago is an F-box protein with 7 tandem WD (tryptophan-aspartic
acid) repeats. It binds directly to cyclin E (123837) and is thought to
target it for ubiquitin-mediated degradation.

CLONING

Moberg et al. (2001) identified the 'archipelago' gene (ago) in a screen
for Drosophila mutants that display increased cell proliferation. They
demonstrated that within the C-terminal region, the ago protein is most
similar to that encoded by an EST designated FLJ11071, which they
renamed 'human AGO.' The human AGO gene has 2 splice variants,
designated alpha and beta, of 707 and 627 amino acids, respectively. The
alpha and beta forms differ only in the N termini and thus are identical
in the putative functional domain containing the F box and 7 WD
(tryptophan-aspartic acid) repeats. Drosophila and human AGO are 78%
identical.

Strohmaier et al. (2001) cloned AGO as CDC4 and found that it has 2
isoforms, one of 110 kD and the other of 69 kD. They found by Northern
blot analysis that CDC4 is expressed in most, if not all, tissues as a
predominant mRNA species of about 5.5 kb. However, brain and skeletal
muscle strongly express a 4-kb mRNA as the predominant form. That CDC4
is expressed at high levels in nonproliferating tissues suggests a
function in addition to turnover of cyclin E (123837), because cyclin E
expression should be limited to tissues undergoing cell division.

By searching EST databases for homologs of C. elegans Sel10, Gupta-Rossi
et al. (2001) identified mouse and human FBXW7, which they called SEL10.
The deduced mouse and human proteins share more than 99% identity, and
their WD40 domains differ at only 2 amino acids. Human SEL10 shares 48%
identity with C. elegans Sel10.

Maruyama et al. (2001) cloned 2 splice variants of mouse Fbxw7, which
they called Fbxw6. The variants differ only in their 3-prime UTRs and
encode a 629-amino acid protein. Northern blot analysis detected
abundant expression of Fbxw7 in mouse brain, heart, and testis, with
lower expression in liver, lung, and kidney. Immunofluorescence analysis
of transfected COS-7 cells localized Fbxw7 to the endoplasmic reticulum
and Golgi apparatus.

Jin et al., (2004) reported that the beta form of FBXW7 contains an
N-terminal transmembrane domain.

GENE FUNCTION

Moberg et al. (2001) demonstrated that archipelago mutant cells have
persistently elevated levels of cyclin E protein without increased
levels of cyclin E RNA. They are underrepresented in G1 fractions and
continue to proliferate when their wildtype neighbors become quiescent.
The archipelago protein binds directly to cyclin E and is thought to
target it for ubiquitin-mediated degradation.

In C. elegans, Sel10 is a negative regulator of Notch (see NOTCH1;
190198) signaling. Gupta-Rossi et al. (2001) showed that mouse Sel10
bound to the C-terminal region of Notch1. A dominant-negative form of
Sel10 lacking the F-box stabilized Notch1 and enhanced its
transcriptional activity, but it had no effect on inactive
membrane-anchored forms of Notch1. Sel10 binding to nuclear Notch1
required Notch1 hyperphosphorylation. Gupta-Rossi et al. (2001)
concluded that SEL10 is involved in ending NOTCH signaling by
ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation of active, phosphorylated
NOTCH1 in the nucleus.

Oberg et al. (2001) showed that human SEL10 ubiquitinated murine Notch1,
and that this ubiquitination required the C-terminal region of the
Notch1 intracellular domain, including the PEST domain. In the presence
of a proteasome inhibitor, the amount of ubiquitinated Notch1
intracellular domain increased, and this accumulation was accompanied by
decreased activation of the Hes1 (139605) promoter, suggesting that
ubiquitinated Notch1 intracellular domain is a less potent
transactivator. SEL10 itself was ubiquitinated and degraded by the
proteasome.

Using coimmunoprecipitation analysis, Maruyama et al. (2001) showed that
mouse Fbxw7 interacted with human SKP1 (SKP1A; 601434) and CUL1 (603134)
in transfected human embryonic kidney cells. The results indicated that
FBXW7 is a component of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex.

Staropoli et al. (2003) demonstrated that parkin (602544) associates
with the F-box proteins FBXW7 and CUL1 in a distinct ubiquitin ligase
complex. FBXW7 serves to target the ligase activity to cyclin E, a
protein previously implicated in the regulation of neuronal apoptosis.
In cells transfected with the parkin T240R mutation (602544.0003),
parkin deficiency potentiated the accumulation of cyclin E in cultured
postmitotic neurons exposed to the glutamatergic excitotoxin kainate and
promoted their apoptosis. Furthermore, parkin overexpression attenuated
cyclin E accumulation in toxin-treated neurons and protected them from
apoptosis.

Welcker et al. (2004) found that FBXW7 promoted proteasome-dependent MYC
(190080) turnover in vivo and MYC ubiquitination in vitro.
Phosphorylation of MYC on thr58 by GSK3 (see 606784) regulated the
binding of FBXW7 to MYC and FBXW7-mediated MYC ubiquitination and
degradation. Because FBXW7 mediates the degradation of cyclin E, NOTCH,
JUN (165160), and MYC, Welcker et al. (2004) proposed that loss of FBXW7
is likely to have profound effects on cell proliferation during
tumorigenesis.

Kishi et al. (2007) stated that RCN proteins (see RCN1; 602735) are
highly conserved and, depending on their phosphorylation status, either
stimulate or inhibit calcineurin (see PPP3CA; 114105), a
Ca(2+)-dependent protein phosphatase that couples Ca(2+) signals to
cellular responses. In yeast, Kishi et al. (2007) found that Cdc4 bound
directly to phosphorylated Rcn1, resulting in Rcn1 ubiquitination and
subsequent degradation and relief of calcineurin inhibition.

Mao et al. (2008) demonstrated that mTOR (601231) is targeted for
ubiquitination and consequent degradation by binding to the tumor
suppressor protein FBXW7. Human breast cancer cell lines and primary
tumors showed a reciprocal relation between loss of FBXW7 and deletion
or mutation of PTEN (601728), which also activates mTOR. Tumor cell
lines harboring deletions or mutations in FBXW7 are particularly
sensitive to rapamycin treatment, suggesting to Mao et al. (2008) that
loss of FBXW7 may be a biomarker for human cancers susceptible to
treatment with inhibitors of the mTOR pathway.

Pierce et al. (2009) developed a quantitative framework based on product
distribution that predicted that the really interesting new gene (RING)
E3 enzymes SCF(Cdc4) and SCF-beta-TrCP (603482) work with the E2 Cdc34
(116948) to build polyubiquitin chains on substrates by sequential
transfers of single ubiquitins. Measurements with millisecond time
resolution directly demonstrated that substrate polyubiquitylation
proceeds sequentially. Pierce et al. (2009) concluded that their results
presented an unprecedented glimpse into the mechanism of RING ubiquitin
ligases and illuminated the quantitative parameters that underlie the
rate and pattern of ubiquitin chain assembly.

Inuzuka et al. (2011) demonstrated that the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCF-FBW7
(a SKP1-cullin-1-F-box complex that contains FBW7 as the F-box protein)
governs cellular apoptosis by targeting MCL1 (159552), a prosurvival
BCL2 (151430) family member, for ubiquitylation and destruction in a
manner that depends on phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase-3
(see 605004). Human T-ALL cell lines showed a close relationship between
FBW7 loss and MCL1 overexpression. Correspondingly, T-ALL cell lines
with defective FBW7 are particularly sensitive to the multikinase
inhibitor sorafenib but resistant to the BCL2 antagonist ABT-737. On the
genetic level, FBW7 reconstitution or MCL1 depletion restores
sensitivity to ABT-737, establishing MCL1 as a therapeutically relevant
bypass survival mechanism that enables FBW7-deficient cells to evade
apoptosis.

Wertz et al. (2011) demonstrated that the prosurvival protein MCL1 is a
crucial regulator of apoptosis triggered by antitubulin
chemotherapeutics. During mitotic arrest, MCL1 protein levels decline
markedly, through a posttranslational mechanism, potentiating cell
death. Phosphorylation of MCL1 directs its interaction with the tumor
suppressor protein FBW7, which is the substrate-binding component of a
ubiquitin ligase complex. The polyubiquitylation of MCL1 then targets it
for proteasomal degradation. The degradation of MCL1 was blocked in
patient-derived tumor cells that lacked FBW7 or had loss-of-function
mutations in FBW7, conferring resistance to antitubulin agents and
promoting chemotherapeutic-induced polyploidy. Additionally, primary
tumor samples were enriched for FBW7 inactivation and elevated MCL1
levels, underscoring the prominent roles of these proteins in
oncogenesis. Wertz et al. (2011) concluded that their findings suggested
that profiling the FBW7 and MCL1 status of tumors, in terms of protein
levels, mRNA levels, and genetic status, could be useful to predict the
response of patients to antitubulin chemotherapeutics.

MAPPING

Jin et al. (2004) reported that the FBXW7 gene maps to chromosome 4q31.3
and the mouse Fbxw7 gene maps to chromosome 3E3.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Moberg et al. (2001) detected mutations in the AGO gene in 4 cancer cell
lines, including 3 of 10 derived from ovarian carcinomas (see 167000).
The cell line derived from T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia,
CCRF-CEM, contains an arginine-to-cysteine change within the third WD
repeat at codon 385. The SK-OV3 ovarian cancer cell line contains an
arginine-to-leucine change within the fourth WD repeat at codon 425. The
mutation in the ovarian cell line MDAH 2774 is a G-to-A transition that
disrupts the splice donor acceptor site of exon 5, resulting in the use
of an adventitious splice acceptor site 37 nucleotides downstream. The
subsequent deletion in the mRNA shifts the reading frame at codon 208
and adds 41 incorrect amino acids after this codon prior to termination.
The protein was predicted to lack part of the F box and all of the WD
repeats. Moberg et al. (2001) suggested that these heterozygous
mutations in human AGO may give cells proliferative advantage. More
significantly, the ovarian cell line OV1063 is homozygous for a
truncating mutation (glu 40 to ter) close to the N terminus of the beta
form that most probably inactivates this isoform. Moberg et al. (2001)
concluded that this gene might represent an important mutational target
in ovarian cancer. Almost 20% of ovarian cancers express increased
levels of cyclin E mRNA, often the result of gene amplification (Courjal
et al., 1996).

Strohmaier et al. (2001) identified a mutation in the CDC4 gene in the
breast cancer (see 114480) cell line SUM149PT, which expresses high
levels of cyclin E. The mutation was an internal genomic duplication of
exons 8 and 9 separated by 11 basepairs of intronic sequence. This
mutation was predicted to result in chain termination, eliminating the
last 4 of 7 WD40 repeats and rendering the resulting polypeptide
nonfunctional. In vitro translation produced a truncated product that
did not bind to phosphorylated cyclin E. Strohmaier et al. (2001)
suggested that CDC4 may be a tumor suppressor associated with some types
of malignancy, including breast cancer.

Rajagopalan et al. (2004) reported the identification of mutations in
the CDC4 gene in both human colorectal cancers (see 114500) and their
precursor lesions. They demonstrated that genetic inactivation of CDC4,
by means of targeted disruption of the gene in karyotypically stable
colorectal cancer cells, results in a phenotype associated with
micronuclei and chromosomal instability. This phenotype can be traced to
a defect in the execution of metaphase and subsequent transmission of
chromosomes, and is dependent on cyclin E, a protein that is regulated
by CDC4. To determine whether CDC4 was genetically altered, its coding
exons were amplified by PCR from 190 colorectal tumors and sequenced.
Somatic mutations in the CDC4 gene were found in 22 of the 190 samples.
Nonsense mutations at codons 224, 278, 303, 393, and 446 were found in 8
tumors. Six of the tumors had biallelic inactivation. The 22 cancers
with CDC4 mutations represented all stages of colorectal cancer. To
determine the point in tumorigenesis at which the mutations occurred,
Rajagopalan et al. (2004) sequenced 58 colorectal adenomas and
identified 4 mutations, 2 of which occurred in adenomas less than 1 cm
in diameter; such lesions had been shown to progress to malignancy only
after 10 to 20 years. Rajagopalan et al. (2004) noted that 18 of the 19
missense mutations identified occurred at the surface of the 8-bladed
beta-propeller structure produced by the WD40 repeats. They concluded
that their data suggested that chromosomal instability is caused by
specific genetic alterations in a large fraction of human cancers and
can occur before malignant conversion.

To explore the genetic origins of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(see 275355), Agrawal et al. (2011) used whole-exome sequencing and gene
copy analyses to study 32 primary tumors. Tumors from patients with a
history of tobacco use had more mutations than did tumors from patients
who did not use tobacco, and tumors that were negative for human
papillomavirus (HPV) had more mutations than did HPV-positive tumors.
Six of the genes that were mutated in multiple tumors were assessed in
up to 88 additional HNSCCs. Among 120 primary HNSCCs, Agrawal et al.
(2011) identified 6 mutations in FBXW7. Two were indels and the other 4
were missense; none was homozygous. The FBXW7 mutations observed were in
a hotspot known to block the degradation of active NOTCH1. Agrawal et
al. (2011) noted that FBXW7 mutations had not been observed in HNSCC,
although they are frequent in other tumor types.

Le Gallo et al. (2012) used whole-exome sequencing to comprehensively
search for somatic mutations in 13 primary serous endometrial tumors
(see 608089), and subsequently resequenced 18 genes that were mutated in
more than 1 tumor and/or were components of an enriched functional
grouping from 40 additional serous tumors. Le Gallo et al. (2012)
identified a high frequency (29%) of somatic mutation in the FBXW7 gene.

ANIMAL MODEL

Tetzlaff et al. (2004) found that Fbw7-null mice died around 10.5 days
postcoitus due to deficiencies in hematopoietic and vascular development
and heart chamber maturation. The absence of Fbw7 resulted in elevated
levels of cyclin E, concurrent with inappropriate DNA replication in
placental giant trophoblast cells. Moreover, the levels of both Notch1
and Notch4 (164951) intracellular domains were elevated, leading to
elevated Hes1, Herp1 (HEY2; 604674), and Herp2 (HEY1; 602953) mRNA
transcription.

Mao et al. (2004) identified the mouse Fbxw7 gene in a mammalian genetic
screen for p53 (191170)-dependent genes involved in tumorigenesis.
Radiation-induced lymphomas from p53 +/- mice, but not those from p53
-/- mice, showed frequent loss of heterozygosity and a 10% mutation rate
of the Fbxw7 gene. Fbxw7 +/- mice had greater susceptibility to
radiation-induced tumorigenesis, but most tumors retained and expressed
the wildtype allele, indicating that Fbxw7 is a haploinsufficient tumor
suppressor gene. Loss of Fbxw7 altered the spectrum of tumors that
developed in p53-deficient mice to include a range of tumors in
epithelial tissues such as lung, liver, and ovary. Mouse embryo
fibroblasts from Fbxw7-deficient mice, or wildtype mouse cells
expressing Fbxw7 small interfering RNA, had higher levels of Aurora-A
kinase (603072), c-Jun (165160), and Notch4 (164951), but not of cyclin
E (123837). Mao et al. (2004) proposed that p53-dependent loss of Fbxw7
leads to genetic instability by mechanisms that might involve the
activation of Aurora-A, providing a rationale for the early occurrence
of these mutations in human cancers.

To assess the usefulness of mouse models in cancer gene discovery and
the extent of cross-species overlap in cancer-associated copy number
aberrations, Maser et al. (2007) engineered lymphoma-prone mice with
chromosomal instability. Along with targeted resequencing, their
comparative oncogenomic studies identified FBXW7 and PTEN (601728) to be
commonly deleted both in murine lymphomas and in human T-cell acute
lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL). The murine cancers acquired
widespread recurrent amplifications and deletions targeting loci
syntenic to those not only in human T-ALL but also in diverse human
hematopoietic, mesenchymal, and epithelial tumors. These results
indicated that murine and human tumors experience common biologic
processes driven by orthologous genetic events in their malignant
evolution. Maser et al. (2007) concluded that the highly concordant
nature of genomic events encourages the use of genomically unstable
murine cancer models in the discovery of biologic driver events in the
human oncogenome.

Matsuoka et al. (2008) created mice with conditional inactivation of
Fbxw7 in bone marrow hematopoietic cells. Inactivation caused premature
depletion of hematopoietic cells due to active cell cycling and
p53-dependent apoptosis. Fbxw7 deletion also conferred a selective
advantage to cells with suppressed p53 function, eventually leading to
development of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Matsuoka et al.
(2008) concluded that FBXW7 functions as a fail-safe mechanism against
both premature hematopoietic stem cell loss and leukemogenesis.

605394	TITLE *605394 BTB AND CNC HOMOLOGY 2; BACH2
;;BASIC LEUCINE ZIPPER TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Members of the small Maf family are basic region leucine zipper (bZIP)
proteins that can function as transcriptional activators or repressors
(see MAFK; 600197). Small Maf proteins can switch from transcriptional
repressors to activators, depending on the proteins with which they form
heterodimers. Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen to identify MafK
heterodimerization partners, Oyake et al. (1996) identified mouse cDNAs
encoding Bach1 (602751) and Bach2. Both Bach proteins contain a BTB
(broad complex-tramtrack-bric-a-brac) or POZ (poxvirus and zinc finger)
protein-interaction domain and a CNC (Cap'n'collar)-type bZIP domain.

By screening a K562 erythroleukemia cell line with mouse Bach2 cDNA as
the probe, Sasaki et al. (2000) isolated a cDNA encoding BACH2. The
deduced 841-amino acid protein is 89.5% identical to mouse Bach2, with
97% identity shared in the BTB and bZIP functional domains and 94%
identity shared in the serine-rich region. Northern blot analysis
revealed expression of an approximately 11.0-kb BACH2 transcript
restricted to thymus, spleen, and leukocytes; low levels were also
detected in small intestine and brain. Sasaki et al. (2000) found mRNA
and protein expression primarily in B-lymphoid rather than other
hematopoietic cell lines. RT-PCR analysis showed that BACH2, like mouse
Bach2, is expressed in primary B cells at the progenitor, precursor,
immature, and mature B-cell stages. Mouse Bach2 is not expressed in
plasma cells (Muto et al., 1998).

GENE FUNCTION

Oyake et al. (1996) demonstrated that mouse Bach1 and Bach2 form
heterodimers with MafK. Bach1 and Bach2 functioned as transcription
repressors in transfection assays using fibroblast cells, but they
functioned as a transcriptional activator and repressor, respectively,
in cultured erythroid cells. Therefore, the authors suggested that the
Bach proteins play important roles in coordinating transcription
activation and repression by MafK.

Gel shift analysis by Sasaki et al. (2000) showed that when
overexpressed, BACH2 binds to MAF recognition elements (MARE).
Overexpression also resulted in a loss of clonogenic activity.
BACH2/CA-1 microsatellite analysis indicated that loss of heterozygosity
occurred in 5 of 25 non-Hodgkin lymphoma (605027) patients.

MAPPING

By FISH, Sasaki et al. (2000) mapped the BACH2 gene to chromosome 6q15.
Southern blot analysis determined that BACH2 is a single-copy gene.

ANIMAL MODEL

Muto et al. (2004) found that Bach2 -/- mice had high levels of serum
IgM but diminished concentrations of IgG subclasses and IgA compared
with wildtype mice. The Bach2 -/- mice also had deficient T
cell-independent and T cell-dependent IgG responses associated with
defective class switch recombination (CSR), somatic hypermutation, and
germinal center formation. While IgM plasma cell development was normal
in mutant mice, class-switched plasma cells were significantly lower
after spleen cell stimulation. Bach2-deficient B cells had reduced Aid
(Aicda; 605257) expression and deregulation of other CSR-associated
genes, notably Blimp1 (PRDM1; 603423), Xbp1 (194355), Irf4 (601900), and
Pax5 (167414). Muto et al. (2004) concluded that BACH2 is a regulator of
the antibody response.

Roychoudhuri et al. (2013) reported that Bach2-deficient mice appear
normal at birth but develop a progressive wasting disease with
diminished survival. Increased levels of autoantibodies were present,
and severe pulmonary and less severe intestinal inflammation was
accompanied by increased levels of Ccr4 (604836) and Ccr9 (604738) on
CD4+ T cells that home to lung and gut, respectively. Analysis of
reconstituted Rag1 (179615)-knockout mice indicated that Bach2 is
required for the formation of both thymic and induced regulatory T
(tTreg and iTreg) cells expressing Foxp3 (300292). ChIP and sequence
analysis determined that Bach2 represses numerous genes in effector
lineage cells, including Ccr4 and Ccr9. In the absence of Bach2, cells
stimulated under conditions to promote iTreg differentiation instead
differentiated into Foxp3-negative cells expressing Tbet (TBX21;
604895), Gata3 (131320), or Ror-gamma-t (RORC; 602943), characteristic
of Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells, respectively. Roychoudhuri et al. (2013)
concluded that BACH2 represses the differentiation programs of multiple
effector lineages in CD4+ T cells, stabilizes the development of Treg
cells, and constrains immune activation to promote immune homeostasis.

614798	TITLE *614798 PELLINO, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 2; PELI2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Pellino proteins, such as PELI2, are intermediate components in the
innate immune response signaling cascades initiated by Toll-like
receptors (TLRs; see 603030) and IL1R (147810), and interact with the
Drosophila Pelle homolog IRAK1 (300283), TRAF6 (602355), and NFKB (see
164011) (summary by Jensen and Whitehead, 2003).

CLONING

By database searching, Resch et al. (2001) identified mouse and human
homologs of Drosophila Pellino. The human PELI2 gene encodes a 420-amino
acid protein.

GENE FUNCTION

By coprecipitation and Western blot analysis, Jensen and Whitehead
(2003) showed that PELI2 interacts with the proteins TRAF6 and TAK1
(MAP3K7; 602614), both downstream of IRAK1 in the TLR/IL1R cascade, but
not MYD88 (602170), an upstream protein. However, PELI2 but not PELI1
(614797) promoted the activation of JUN (165160) and ELK1 (311040)
through phosphorylation of JNK (MAPK8; 601158).

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen for proteins interacting with IRAK4
(606883), Strelow et al. (2003) identified PELI2. Immunoprecipitation
analysis showed interaction with IRAK1 and IRAK4 independently of their
kinase activities. PELI2 is phosphorylated by kinase-active IRAK1 and
IRAK4. Strelow et al. (2003) proposed that PELI2 could be a scaffolding
molecule linking Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) signaling (see
601194) to general cellular processes.

Using phage display, followed by immunoprecipitation analysis, Liu et
al. (2004) identified PELI2, as well as SOCS3 (604176), as an
interacting partner of BCL10 (603517) in response to lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) stimulation in the TLR pathway. The interaction occurs through
residues 169 through 233 of PELI2 and is blocked indirectly by SOCS3
expression.

Kim et al. (2012) showed that knockdown of PELI2, but not PELI1,
abolishes IL1 (see 147760)- and LPS-induced ubiquitination of IRAK1 at
lys63 and reduces ubiquitination through lys48. PELI2 is also required
for TAK1-dependent NFKB activation. RT-PCR analysis indicated that PELI2
knockdown reduced IL1- and LPS-induced KC (CXCL1; 155730), IL6 (147620),
and TNF (191160) expression in mouse macrophages at late time points
accompanied by decay of the inflammatory gene mRNAs. Knockdown also
attenuated JNK and ERK (MAPK3; 601795) activation. Kim et al. (2012)
concluded that PELI2 plays a critical role in TLR/IL1R-mediated
posttranscriptional control.

GENE STRUCTURE

Resch et al. (2001) determined that the PELI2 gene consists of 6 exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Resch et al. (2001) mapped the PELI2 gene
to chromosome 14q21.

605117	TITLE *605117 SUPPRESSOR OF CYTOKINE SIGNALING 2; SOCS2
;;STAT-INDUCED STAT INHIBITOR 2; SSI2; STATI2;;
CYTOKINE-INDUCIBLE SH2 PROTEIN 2; CIS2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SOCS proteins, such as SOCS2, negatively regulate cytokine receptor
signaling via the Janus kinase (see 147795)/signal transducer and
activation of transcription (STAT; see 600555) pathway (the JAK/STAT
pathway) (Minamoto et al., 1997).

CLONING

By a computer-aided homology search of sequence databases, Minamoto et
al. (1997) identified a partial sequence of SSI2, a member of the SSI
(STAT-induced STAT inhibitor) gene family. They isolated an SSI2 cDNA
from a Jurkat cDNA library. SSI2 encodes a protein of 198 amino acids.
The deduced amino acid sequences of human SSI2 and SSI3 (604176) share
significant homology with human and mouse SSI1 (SOCS1; 603597) and mouse
Cis (602441) at the C-terminal region as well as in the SH2 domain.
Northern blot analysis revealed strong expression of SSI2 in heart,
placenta, lung, kidney, and prostate.

On the basis of an EST database search, Masuhara et al. (1997)
identified SOCS2, which they called CIS2. They found that a C-terminal
40-amino acid region, designated the CIS homology (CH) domain, and the
SH2 domain are highly conserved in the CIS genes, while the respective
N-terminal regions of these proteins share little similarity.

Dey et al. (1998) identified SOCS2 based on its interaction with the
cytoplasmic domain of insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF1R;
147370) in a yeast 2-hybrid screen. They cloned a full-length SOCS2 cDNA
by 5-prime RACE PCR of a human fetal brain cDNA library. Northern blot
analysis demonstrated expression of SOCS2 in many human fetal and adult
tissues, with particular abundance in fetal kidney and adult heart,
skeletal muscle, pancreas, and liver.

GENE FUNCTION

Minamoto et al. (1997) found that SSI2 expression was induced by
cytokine stimulation, and its forced expression in the mouse myeloid
leukemia cell line M1 suppressed the apoptotic affects of LIF (159540)
similarly to SSI1.

Dey et al. (1998) found that the human SOCS2 protein interacted strongly
with the activated IGF1R and not with a kinase-negative mutant receptor
in yeast 2-hybrid assays. Mutation of receptor tyrosines 950, 1250,
1251, and 1316 to phenylalanine or deletion of the C-terminal 93 amino
acids did not result in decreased interaction of the receptor with human
SOCS2 protein. SOCS2 interacted with IGF1R both in vitro and in vivo.
Dey et al. (1998) concluded that their results raised the possibility
that SOCS proteins may play a regulatory role in IGF1 receptor
signaling.

Machado et al. (2006) showed that lipoxin A4 (LXA4) activated 2
receptors in mouse splenic dendritic cells, Ahr (600253) and Lxar
(FPRL1; 136538), and that this activation triggered Socs2.
Socs2-deficient mouse dendritic cells were hyperresponsive to microbial
stimuli and were refractory to the inhibitory action of LXA4, but not
Il10 (124092). Upon infection with an intracellular pathogen,
Socs2-deficient mice had uncontrolled production of proinflammatory
cytokines, decreased microbial proliferation, aberrant leukocyte
infiltration, and elevated mortality. Machado et al. (2006) also showed
that Socs2 was a crucial intracellular mediator of the antiinflammatory
actions of aspirin-induced lipoxins in vivo.

GENE STRUCTURE

Metcalf et al. (2000) demonstrated that the mouse SOCS2 gene is composed
of 3 exons and 2 introns.

MAPPING

By cytogenetic and radiation hybrid mapping, Yandava et al. (1999)
mapped the SOCS2 gene to chromosome 12q21.3-q23.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Kato et al. (2006) performed a region-wide association analysis on
12q15-q22 using more than 500 SNPs in 1,492 unrelated Japanese
individuals and identified an association between type II diabetes
(125853) and a 13.6-kb haplotype block that includes the entire SOCS2
gene. Five SNPs in the 5-prime region of the SOCS2 gene were
significantly associated with type II diabetes. Kato et al. (2006)
concluded that SOCS2 may play a role in susceptibility to type II
diabetes in the Japanese.

ANIMAL MODEL

Metcalf et al. (2000) generated mice deficient in Socs2 by targeted
disruption. Socs2-deficient mice were indistinguishable from their
littermates until weaning at 3 weeks of age, but subsequently grew more
rapidly. Socs2 -/- adult males were on average 40% heavier than wildtype
littermates. Adult Socs2 +/- males exhibited an intermediate body
weight. Increased growth was also significant but less marked in female
Socs2 -/- mice. Adult Socs2 -/- females typically attained the weight of
wildtype male mice, but heterozygous Socs2 females were not
significantly heavier than sex-matched wildtype littermates. Neither
male nor female Socs2 -/- mice accumulated significantly more fatty
tissue than wildtype mice. Rather, increased body weight in these mice
resulted from an increase in the weight of most visceral organs.
Sexually dimorphic or male-specific organs were not disproportionately
enlarged. Carcass weight was also significantly increased, indicating
that muscle and bone may contribute significantly to the increased size
of Socs2-deficient mice. There was significant increase in long bone
length. Tail length was normal. The increase in size was due to elevated
cell numbers rather than increased cell size. Metcalf et al. (2000)
observed a marked thickening of the dermis associated with excessive
collagen accumulation in all of 7 males, and less prominently in 6 of 8
female Socs2 -/- mice. Collagen deposition was also increased around the
bronchi and vessels of the lungs of 6 of the 9 male, but only 3 of 10
female, Socs2-deficient mice. No hematologic abnormalities were
observed. The characteristics of Socs2 -/- mice were similar to those of
mice with growth hormone (GH; 139250) excess and IGF1 (147440) excess.
Characteristics of deregulated growth hormone and IGF1 signaling,
including decreased production of major urinary protein, increased local
IGF1 production, and collagen accumulation in the dermis were observed
in Socs2-deficient mice, indicating that Socs2 may have an essential
negative regulatory role in the growth hormone/IGF1 pathway.

Turnley et al. (2002) studied the role of Socs2 in mouse neural
development. They found that Socs2 was expressed by mouse progenitor
cells and neurons in response to LIF-like cytokines. Progenitor cells
lacking Socs2 produced fewer neurons and more astrocytes in vitro. Socs2
-/- mice had fewer neurons and neurogenin-1 (NGN1; 601726)-expressing
cells in the developing cortex, whereas overexpression of Socs2
increased neuronal differentiation. Turnley et al. (2002) found that GH
inhibited Ngn1 expression and neuronal production, and this action was
blocked by Socs2 overexpression. They speculated that Socs2 promotes
neuronal differentiation by blocking GH-mediated downregulation of Ngn1.

Using GH-deficient Socs2 -/- mice, Greenhalgh et al. (2005) demonstrated
that the Socs2 -/- phenotype is dependent upon the presence of
endogenous GH. Treatment with exogenous GH induced excessive growth in
terms of overall body weight, body and bone lengths, and the weight of
internal organs and tissues. Microarray analysis on liver RNA extracts
after exogenous GH administration revealed a heightened response to GH.
The conserved C-terminal SOCS-box motif was essential for all inhibitory
function. SOCS2 was found to bind 2 phosphorylated tyrosines on the GH
receptor (600946), and mutation analysis of these amino acids showed
that both were essential for SOCS2 function. Greenhalgh et al. (2005)
concluded that SOCS2 is a negative regulator of GH signaling.
