600327	TITLE *600327 SYNAPTOTAGMIN 3; SYT3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Synaptotagmin-1 (SYT1; 185605), an integral membrane protein of synaptic
vesicles, is thought to be involved in calcium-dependent exocytosis of
synaptic vesicles. Mizuta et al. (1994) cloned a novel isoform of
synaptotagmin, designated synaptotagmin-3, from a rat brain cDNA library
and studied its tissue distribution. The protein contains 588 amino
acids having 40.5, 38.3, and 64.0% identity with rat synaptotagmin-1,
rat synaptotagmin-2 (SYT2; 600104), and a third synaptotagmin isoform of
the marine ray, respectively. The region of the 2 internal repeats
homologous to the regulatory domain of protein kinase C was highly
conserved among the 3 synaptotagmins. RNA blot studies demonstrated that
synaptotagmin-3 mRNA is expressed in brain, various endocrine tissues,
and hormone-secreting clonal cells. It appeared to be involved in
Ca(2+)-dependent exocytosis of secretory vesicles in endocrine cells, as
well as in neurons.

GENE FUNCTION

By in vitro characterization of recombinant rat Syt3, Li et al. (1995)
determined that Syt3 showed Ca(2+)-dependent binding to phospholipids,
Ca(2+)-dependent binding to syntaxins (see 186590), and
Ca(2+)-independent binding to adaptor protein-2 (see 601026).

MAPPING

Using an interspecific backcross DNA panel, Jones et al. (1995)
demonstrated that the mouse Syt3 gene is located on mouse chromosome 7;
no recombinants were observed between Syt3 and the kallikrein gene
family (Kal) in 94 meioses. To map human SYT3, they probed a Southern
blot containing genomic DNAs from a somatic cell mapping panel and found
segregation with chromosome 19. Thus, SYT3 appears to be located in the
conserved linkage group on proximal mouse chromosome 7 and human
chromosome 19q that is known to include at least 28 genes (Holdener et
al., 1993). Kwon et al. (1995) likewise mapped Syt3 to mouse chromosome
7.

610909	TITLE *610909 MINICHROMOSOME MAINTENANCE COMPLEX-BINDING PROTEIN; MCMBP
;;CHROMOSOME 10 OPEN READING FRAME 119; C10ORF119
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DNA replication is a carefully orchestrated process involving many
proteins that assemble at origins of replication. Among these are the 6
proteins of the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex (e.g., MCM2;
116945), which form a hexamer. Each MCM subunit performs an essential
function in initiation and elongation of DNA replication. MCMBP can
replace MCM2 in the MCM complex, thus forming an alternative MCM hexamer
(Sakwe et al., 2007).

CLONING

By purifying MCM6 (601806)- and MCM7 (600592)-containing complexes from
human 293T cells, followed by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry, Sakwe et
al. (2007) identified MCMBP as a 65-kD MCM complex-binding protein. The
640-amino acid MCMBP protein shares limited homology with members of the
MCM family and is highly conserved in multicellular eukaryotes.
Immunofluorescence microscopy showed extensive nuclear localization of
MCMBP in HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using immunofluorescence microscopy and cellular fractionation, Sakwe et
al. (2007) showed that MCMBP bound to chromatin in a manner typical of
MCM proteins, and that MCMBP was preferentially associated with a
cellular origin in G1 but not S phase. In vivo tagging experiments,
coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous MCM proteins in HeLa cells, and
analysis of recombinant MCM complexes in insect cells revealed that
MCMBP formed a hexamer with MCM3 (602693) through MCM7 that excluded
MCM2; conversely, the hexamer of MCM2 through MCM7 excluded MCMBP. MCMBP
also formed a complex with the MCM4 (602638)/MCM6/MCM7 core helicase in
vitro, but, unlike MCM2, MCMBP did not inhibit helicase activity. Sakwe
et al. (2007) concluded that 2 forms of MCM complexes occur, those with
MCM2 and those in which MCMBP replaces MCM2.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the MCMBP
gene to chromosome 10 (TMAP A005M41).

601745	TITLE *601745 POTASSIUM CHANNEL, SUBFAMILY K, MEMBER 1; KCNK1
;;POTASSIUM CHANNEL, WEAKLY INWARD-RECTIFYING, WITH TWIN P DOMAINS,
1; TWIK1;;
K2P1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

KCNK1 is a potassium-selective, pH-sensitive, openly rectifying channel
regulated by sumoylation (see SUMO1; 601912) (Rajan et al., 2005).

CLONING

Lesage et al. (1996) cloned a member of a new class of potassium
channels by computer identification of an EST with predicted sequence
similarity to the P domain, a region involved in the potassium
conduction pathway, of other channels. A cDNA, designated TWIK1 by the
authors, was obtained from a human kidney library and shown to encode a
predicted 336-amino acid protein. Unlike other potassium channels, TWIK1
has 4, rather than 6, transmembrane domains and 2, rather than 1, P
domains. Two genes from C. elegans are related. Northern blot analysis
showed that TWIK1 was widely expressed, with high levels in brain and
heart.

GENE FUNCTION

Lesage et al. (1996) found that human TWIK1 could direct expression of
weakly inward-rectifying potassium currents when expressed in Xenopus
oocytes. They speculated that TWIK1 channels may be involved in the
control of background potassium membrane conductances.

Rajan et al. (2005) found that K2P1 was sumoylated on intracellular
lys274 by Xenopus or human UBC9 (UBE2I; 601661) at the cell surface, and
that sumoylation rendered the channel inactive. Mutation of lys274 or
desumoylation of K2P1 by SENP1 (612157) activated the mute pore,
allowing its characterization. K2P1 functioned as a potassium-selective
leak channel with unitary conductance that passed larger outward than
inward currents under physiologic conditions. K2P1 was active at all
physiologic voltages and was sensitive to external pH via protonation of
conserved his122 in the first P loop. Rajan et al. (2005) concluded that
K2P1 is an openly rectifying potassium channel that is sensitive to pH
and regulated by sumoylation.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Miller and Long (2012) presented the 3.4-angstrom resolution crystal
structure of a human K2P channel, K2P1 (TWIK1). Unlike other potassium
channel structures, K2P1 is dimeric. An extracellular cap domain located
above the selectivity filter forms an ion pathway in which potassium
ions flow through side portals. Openings within the transmembrane region
expose the pore to the lipid bilayer and are filled with electron
density attributable to alkyl chains. An interfacial helix appears
structurally poised to affect gating.

MAPPING

Lesage et al. (1996) mapped the KCNK1 gene by in situ hybridization to
1q42-q43.

;;CHROMOSOME 18 OPEN READING FRAME 45; C18ORF45
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Hansen et al. (2012) identified TMEM241, which they called C18ORF45, by
microarray analysis to find genes upregulated following hyperactivation
of ERO1L (615435), an endoplasmic reticulum resident oxidoreductase. The
deduced protein shows sequence similarity to the S. cerevisiae
Golgi-resident protein GDP-mannose transporter-1 (GMT1) and has multiple
predicted transmembrane domains.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the TMEM241 gene to chromosome 18q11.2 based on an
alignment of the TMEM241 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK123623) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

611911	TITLE *611911 IRON-SULFUR CLUSTER SCAFFOLD, E. COLI, HOMOLOG OF; ISCU
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters are prosthetic groups found in respiratory
chain complexes and numerous mitochondrial and cytosolic enzymes.
Assembly of Fe-S clusters requires scaffold proteins, such as ISCU, as
well as cysteine desulfurases, iron donors, and chaperones (Li et al.,
2006).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for homologs of yeast Isu proteins,
followed by 5-prime RACE of heart and liver RNA, Tong and Rouault (2000)
cloned 2 ISCU splice variants, ISCU1 and ISCU2. Both variants share the
same transcription initiation site, but they differ in the presence
(ISCU1) or absence (ISCU2) of exon 1B. ISCU1 encodes a deduced 142-amino
acid protein with 13 unique N-terminal residues, and ISCU2 encodes a
deduced 167-amino acid protein with 38 unique N-terminal residues,
including a mitochondrial targeting signal. They have predicted
molecular masses of 15.4 and 17.9 kD, respectively. Northern blot
analysis with specific probes detected endogenous ISCU1 and ISCU2
transcripts of 1.4 and 1.3 kb, respectively, in heart and RD4
rhabdomyosarcoma cells. Northern blot analysis of a human tissue panel
using a common probe detected a 1.35-kb transcript expressed
predominantly in heart and skeletal muscle. Immunofluorescence
microscopy of transfected COS cells showed that ISCU1 localized to
cytosol and nucleus, whereas ISCU2 colocalized with a mitochondrial
marker. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis of fractionated
RD4 cells detected an endogenous ISCU1 protein of 15 kD. ISCU2 appeared
to undergo rapid 2-step processing, with proteolytic cleavage at glu27
and then at tyr35, resulting in a mature protein of about 14 kD. A 19-kD
form of cytosolic ISCU was also detected.

GENE STRUCTURE

Olsson et al. (2008) noted that the ISCU gene contains 6 exons.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the ISCU
gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP D12S1907).

In a study of patients with hereditary myopathy and lactic acidosis
(255125), Mochel et al. (2008) found that the ISCU gene lies in a region
of homozygosity for that disorder on chromosome 12q24.11.

GENE FUNCTION

ISCS (NFS1; 603485) is a cysteine desulfurase thought to sequester
inorganic sulfur for Fe-S cluster assembly. By coimmunoprecipitation and
Western blot analysis of fractionated RD4 cells, Tong and Rouault (2000)
found that the mitochondrial and cytosolic ISCU isoforms associated with
the mitochondrial and cytosolic ISCS isoforms in their respective
fractions, suggesting that separate Fe-S cluster assembly complexes
exist in the cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments.

Using isoform-specific small interfering RNA in HeLa cells, Tong and
Rouault (2006) showed that the mitochondrial and cytosolic isoforms of
ISCU were necessary for the activities of mitochondrial aconitase (ACO2;
100850) and cytosolic aconitase (ACO1; 100880), respectively. In
addition, knockdown of the ISCU isoforms inappropriately activated the
iron regulatory element-binding activities and iron regulatory functions
of ACO1 and IREB2 (147582) and disrupted intracellular iron homeostasis.
Endogenous ISCU levels were depressed by iron deprivation. Tong and
Rouault (2006) concluded that ISCU is involved in a coordinated response
to iron deficiency that includes activation of iron uptake,
redistribution of intracellular iron, and decreased utilization of iron
in Fe-S proteins.

Li et al. (2006) found that the cytosolic isoforms of human ISCS and
ISCU formed a complex in vitro. When incubated with IRP1 (ACO1),
cysteine, and iron, the cytosolic forms of ISCS and ISCU facilitated
formation of a 4Fe-4S cluster on IRP1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

A myopathy with severe exercise intolerance and myoglobinuria (255125)
has been described as an autosomal recessive trait in patients from
northern Sweden, with associated deficiencies of succinate dehydrogenase
and aconitase in skeletal muscle. Mochel et al. (2008) identified the
ISCU gene as a candidate within a region of shared homozygosity on
chromosome 12q in 3 patients from 3 families with this disorder. They
identified a homozygous intronic G-to-C transversion (7044G-C, or
IVS5+382G-C; 611911.0001) in the ISCU gene in all 3 affected
individuals. The mutation strengthened a weak splice acceptor site
within intron 5, leading to retention of a 100-bp intronic sequence and
resulting in 15 amino acids and a premature stop codon. A marked
reduction of ISCU mRNA and mitochondrial ISCU protein in patient muscle
was associated with a decrease in the iron regulatory protein IRP1
(100880) and intracellular iron overload in skeletal muscle, consistent
with a muscle-specific alteration of iron homeostasis in this disorder.
ISCU interacts with the Friedreich ataxia (FRDA; 229300) gene product
frataxin (FXN; 606829) in iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis.

In 15 affected members from 9 families with hereditary myopathy and
lactic acidosis, Olsson et al. (2008) independently mapped the locus to
chromosome 12q23.2-q24.11 (maximum lod score of 5.26 at D12S84). They
identified homozygosity for the intronic G-to-C transversion in the ISCU
gene in all affected individuals.

ANIMAL MODEL

Nordin et al. (2011) found that Iscu -/- mice were embryonic lethal. No
homozygous null embryos were identified at embryonic day (E) 7.5 to
10.5, but at E3.5, 2 of 9 embryos were homozygous for the null allele,
suggesting that Iscu is important for the implantation or early
development of the embryo. In contrast, Iscu +/- mice showed no apparent
physical impairment and were similar to the wildtype mice. Tissue from
heterozygous mice showed decreased levels of Iscu protein, but the
reduction was less than 50%, suggesting upregulation of the functional
allele.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MYOPATHY WITH LACTIC ACIDOSIS, HEREDITARY
ISCU, IVS5, G-C, +382

from northern Sweden, Mochel et al. (2008) found homozygosity for an
intronic G-to-C transversion (7044G-C, or IVS5+382G-C) in the ISCU gene.
There were 3 heterozygous carriers of the mutation among 568 Swedish
chromosomes, resulting in a frequency of approximately 1 in 188 in this
population. Western blot analysis of patient muscle showed a substantial
reduction of the normal mitochondrial isoform (ISCU2) compared to
controls. The mutation was thought to strengthen a weak splicing
acceptor site, with consequent retention of a 100-bp intronic sequence
upstream of the known terminal exon, introduction of a stop codon, and
decreased levels of ISCU mRNA and protein. The depletion of
mitochondrial ISCU in muscle would account for the biochemical and
clinical phenotype, which is characterized by a deficiency in
mitochondrial iron-sulfur proteins and impaired muscle oxidative
metabolism.

Independently, Olsson et al. (2008) identified homozygosity the G-to-C
transversion in intron 5 of the ISCU gene in 15 affected members from 9
families with hereditary myopathy and lactic acidosis. RT-PCR studies
showed aberrant splicing of the ISCU mRNA in patient muscle biopsies
compared to controls, with significantly decreased levels of the
mitochondrial ISCU2 isoform. However, patient mRNA did not correspond to
the cytosolic ISCU1 isoform; rather, patient mRNA contained a 100-bp
sequence from intron 5, inserted between exons 4 and 5. This was due to
activation of cryptic acceptor and donor splice sites. The added intron
sequence resulted in an alternative C-terminal 15 amino acids followed
by a stop codon.

Kollberg and Holme (2009) demonstrated that an antisense oligonucleotide
specifically targeting activated cryptic splice sites in the ISCU gene
induced by the 7044G-C mutation was able to restore the correct reading
frame in cultured fibroblasts derived from patients with homozygous
mutation. The restoration in cells was stable, with correctly spliced
mRNA remaining the dominant RNA species after 21 days.

Sanaker et al. (2010) reported a Norwegian woman with the disorder who
was homozygous for the 7044G-C mutation. Activities of mitochondrial
complexes I, II, and III were decreased in skeletal muscle samples,
whereas cultured myoblasts and fibroblasts had nearly normal activity.
Western blot analysis showed decreased ISCU type I in muscle, myoblasts,
and fibroblasts. The steady-state level of ISCU mRNA was significantly
decreased in patient myoblasts (20% of controls), moderately decreased
in muscle (54% of controls), and normal in fibroblasts. The mutant
transcript containing exons 5, 5A, and 6 was the predominant (90%)
species in patient muscle, although low levels (10%) of the normal
transcript with exons 5 and 6 were also found. Control samples had low
levels of the mutant transcript as well, suggesting that the mutation
strengthens a preexisting weak splice site. Patient blood, myoblasts,
and fibroblasts had equal amounts of both transcripts. Patient muscle
also specifically showed an increase in mitochondrial content compared
to controls, perhaps representing a compensatory mechanism. These
findings suggested that the ratio between normally spliced and
abnormally spliced transcript is important in determining tissue
specificity of the defect.

Nordin et al. (2011) demonstrated tissue-specific expression of the
mutant spliced ISCU protein. RT-PCR analysis of postmortem tissue
samples from a patient with the IVS5 mutation showed that the muscle had
the highest relative amount of mutant mRNA (80%), with the transcript
containing the 100-bp insert being the most common. In heart and liver,
the wildtype mRNA predominated, representing 70% total mRNA in heart and
54% in liver. The findings were confirmed by Western blot analysis of
the tissues. The results indicated that tissue-specific differential
splicing underlies the muscle-specific phenotype in patients with this
ISCU mutation.

Nordin et al. (2012) found that the RNA-binding factor IGF2BP1 (608288)
had a higher affinity for mutant ISCU than wildtype ISCU. PTBP1
(600693), implicated in repression of incorrect splicing, bound strongly
to both wildtype and mutant ISCU. In vitro studies using an ISCU
minigene showed that PTBP1 dramatically repressed incorrect splicing
when coexpressed with the mutant minigene, resulting in a 0.13-fold
change of the mutant:normal transcript ratio. In contrast, IGF2B1 and
RBM39 (604739) resulted in an increased mutant:normal transcript ratio
and were able to counteract the effect of PTBP1. Nordin et al. (2012)
suggested that IGF2BP1 in particular may be a factor that promotes the
inclusion of the pseudoexon in mutant ISCU by interfering with PTBP1
binding and repression of mutant ISCU.

.0002
MYOPATHY WITH LACTIC ACIDOSIS, HEREDITARY
ISCU, GLY50GLU

(255125), Kollberg et al. (2009) identified compound heterozygosity for
the common intronic G-to-C mutation (611911.0001) and a 149G-A
transition in exon 3 of the ISCU gene, resulting in a gly50-to-glu
(G50E) substitution. The G50E mutation was inherited from their
unaffected Finnish mother and was not found in 100 Finnish controls.
Western blot analysis of skeletal muscle mitochondria showed only
slightly reduced levels of ISCU protein in the 2 brothers, suggesting
that the missense mutation gives rise to a nonfunctional protein. The
boys had a more severe phenotype than patients homozygous for the
intronic 7044G-C mutation. The brothers had progressive and severe
muscle weakness and muscle wasting beginning at age 2 years. They also
showed evidence of cardiac involvement, with EKG changes and mild
cardiac hypertrophy without dilatation. Kollberg et al. (2009) noted
that the boys did not complain of exercise intolerance, and suggested
that they were too weak to even elicit symptoms such as tachycardia,
palpitations, or shortness of breath.

605936	TITLE *605936 BRIDGING INTEGRATOR 2; BIN2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

BAR proteins, such as BIN2, which are characterized by a common
N-terminal BAR domain, are adaptor proteins involved in diverse cellular
processes. BIN1 (601248), a member of the BAR family, interacts with and
inhibits the oncogenic properties of MYC (190080) (summary by Ge and
Prendergast, 2000).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to BIN1, followed by
screening a leukocyte phage cDNA library, Ge and Prendergast (2000)
identified a cDNA encoding BIN2. Sequence analysis predicted that the
564-amino acid protein has a BAR motif that is 61% identical to that of
BIN1 and slightly less similar to that of AMPH (600418). BIN2 has acidic
and serine/proline-rich stretches but lacks a C-terminal SH3 domain or a
MYC-interacting region. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a
major 2.6-kb transcript that was highest in spleen and peripheral blood
leukocytes and also high in thymus, colon, and placenta, suggesting
preferential expression in hematopoietic tissues. Strong expression was
detected in lymphoid and granulocytic cell lines but not other cell
lines. Coimmunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses showed expression
of an 80-kD protein that interacts with the N-terminal portion of the
BAR domain of BIN1 isoforms but not with AMPH. Immunofluorescence
microscopy demonstrated cytosolic expression and lack of
receptor-mediated endocytic function for BIN2. Functional analysis
showed that BIN2 lacks tumor suppressor features.

MAPPING

Using FISH, Ge and Prendergast (2000) mapped the BIN2 gene to 4q22.1.

600870	TITLE *600870 G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR KINASE 5; GRK5
;;GPRK5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) kinases (GRKs), such as GRK5, are
important regulators of GPCR function and mediate receptor
desensitization, internalization, and signaling. Several non-GPCR
proteins also serve as GRK substrates, and GRKs have been shown to have
kinase-independent functions in receptor and effector regulation
(summary by Michal et al., 2012).

CLONING

By PCR on neutrophil cDNA using primers based on sequences of known
receptor kinases, Haribabu and Snyderman (1993) identified GPRK5 and
GPRK6 (GRK6; 600869) sequences.

Using degenerate oligonucleotide primers to amplify GRK-conserved
sequences from a heart cDNA library, followed by screening the heart
cDNA library, Kunapuli and Benovic (1993) cloned GRK5. The deduced
590-amino acid protein has a predicted central protein kinase catalytic
domain and a calculated molecular mass of 67.7 kD. GRK5 shares 69% amino
acid identity with IT11 (GRK4; 137026) and is also closely related to
Drosophila Gprk2 and bovine rhodopsin kinase (GRK1; 180381). Northern
blot analysis detected a GRK5 transcript of about 3 kb that showed
highest expression in human heart, placenta, and lung, followed by
skeletal muscle, brain, liver, and pancreas, with little expression in
kidney.

By Western blot analysis and immunohistochemical analysis of human cell
lines, Michal et al. (2012) showed that GRK5 colocalized with
gamma-tubulin (see 191135), centrin (see 603187) and pericentrin (PCNT;
605925) at centrosomes and that it preferentially associated with the
mother centriole. In synchronized HeLa cells, GRK5 associated with
centrosomes predominantly during interphase and dispersed during
mitosis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kunapuli and Benovic (1993) determined that the 5-prime UTR of GPRK5 is
relatively GC rich.

MAPPING

Bullrich et al. (1995) used a rodent-human hybrid panel to map 2 newly
identified members of the GRK family: GPRK5 and GPRK6 (600869) to
10q24-qter and 5q35, respectively. The hybrid cells containing parts of
chromosomes 10 and 5 were used for the regionalization.

GENE FUNCTION

Kunapuli and Benovic (1993) showed that GRK5 expressed in insect cells
phosphorylated rhodopsin (RHO; 180380) in a light-dependent manner.

Fan and Malik (2003) noted that desensitization of GPCRs regulates the
number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), as well as their motility
and ability to stop upon contact with pathogens or target cells, and
this desensitization is mediated by GRKs. They found that MIP2 (CXCL2;
139110) induces GRK2 (109635) and GRK5 expression in PMNs through PI3KG
(PIK3CG; 601232) signaling. However, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), acting
through TLR4 (603030) signaling, mediated through MEK1 (176872)/MEK2
(601263), transcriptionally downregulates expression of GRK2 and GRK5 in
response to MIP2, which decreases chemokine receptor desensitization and
markedly augments PMN migration. Therefore, LPS-activated TLR4 signaling
regulates PMN migration by modulating the expression of chemokine
receptors in a GRK2- and GRK5-dependent manner.

By depolymerizing microtubules, Michal et al. (2012) showed that
association of GRK5 with centrosomes in human cell lines was independent
of microtubules. Knockdown of GRK5 expression in HeLa cells induced G2/M
arrest or delay, which appeared to be due to increased expression of p53
(TP53; 191170), inhibition of AURKA (603072), and subsequent delay in
PLK1 (602098) activation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Liggett et al. (2008) identified a leu41-to-gln (L41Q) polymorphism in
the GRK5 gene that was associated with decreased mortality in African
Americans with heart failure or cardiac ischemia. Studies in transfected
cells and transgenic mice showed that GRK5-L41 uncoupled
isoproterenol-stimulated responses more effectively than did GRK5-Q41
and protected against experimental catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy,
similarly to pharmacologic beta-blockade. In 375 prospectively followed
African American patients with heart failure, GRK5-L41 protected against
death or cardiac transplantation. Liggett et al. (2008) concluded that
enhanced beta-adrenergic receptor desensitization of excessive
catecholamine signaling by GRK-L41 provides a 'genetic beta-blockade'
that improves survival in African Americans with heart failure,
suggesting a reason for conflicting results of beta-blocker clinical
trials in that population.

ANIMAL MODEL

By targeted deletion, Gainetdinov et al. (1999) created Grk5-null mice.
Homozygous mutant mice were viable and showed no anatomic or behavioral
abnormalities compared with wildtype littermates. However, the core body
temperature of mutant mice was about 0.9 degrees C below normal. Since
the central cholinergic system is involved in thermoregulation,
Gainetdinov et al. (1999) challenged mutant mice with a nonselective
muscarinic agonist, oxotremorine. Mutant mice showed enhanced classical
cholinergic responses, such as hypothermia, hypoactivity, tremor, and
salivation. The antinociceptive effect of oxotremorine was potentiated
and prolonged, and muscarinic receptors in brains of Grk5-null mice
resisted oxotremorine-induced desensitization.

605453	TITLE *605453 ATP-BINDING CASSETTE, SUBFAMILY B, MEMBER 9; ABCB9
DESCRIPTION For background information on the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of
transporter proteins, see ABCA4 (601691). In addition to the 'full' ABC
transporters with 2 transmembrane domains and 2 nucleotide-binding
domains, there are 'half' proteins that contain only 1 of each domain
(e.g., ABCB1; 171050). Full transporters are usually found in the plasma
membrane, whereas half transporters are found in subcellular organelles.

By searching an EST database and screening a T-lymphoblast cDNA library,
Zhang et al. (2000) obtained a cDNA encoding ABCB9. Sequence analysis
predicted that the 766-amino acid ABCB9 protein has 10 potential
N-terminal transmembrane segments. ABCB9 shares 94% identity with the
rodent sequences and is approximately 39% identical to 2 human
endoplasmic reticulum half transporters, TAP1 (ABCB2; 170260) and TAP2
(ABCB3; 170261). RT-PCR and genomic sequence analysis established the
existence of a splice variant with a 129-bp deletion expressed in testis
and brain. Northern blot analysis detected low expression of a 3.7-kb
transcript in most tissues tested, with an additional 2.2-kb transcript
detected in tissues with relatively high expression, such as testis.
Western blot analysis showed expression of a 72-kD nonglycosylated
protein, significantly smaller than the predicted mass of 84.5 kD, that
was enriched in lysosomes. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated
colocalization of ABCB9 with the lysosomal proteins LAMP1 (153330) and
LAMP2 (309060). Immunohistochemical analysis detected ABCB9 expression
in Sertoli cells of rodent seminiferous tubules.

Allikmets et al. (1996) mapped an EST corresponding to the ABCB9 gene to
12q24.

;;LEU-GLY-ASN REPEAT-ENRICHED PROTEIN; LGN;;
TRANSDUCIN-BINDING PARTNER, ROD-SPECIFIC;;
PINS, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Heterotrimeric G proteins transduce extracellular signals received by
cell surface receptors into integrated cellular responses. GPSM2 belongs
to a group of proteins that modulate activation of G proteins (Blumer et
al., 2002).

CLONING

Using GNAI2 (139360) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a B-cell cDNA
library, followed by screening a HeLa cell cDNA library, Mochizuki et
al. (1996) cloned full-length GPSM2, which they designated LGN due to
the presence of 10 leu-gly-asn repeats in the protein. The deduced
677-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 76 kD. The
N-terminal half of LGN contains the leu-gly-asn repeats, which are
located within 7 repeats of about 40 amino acids that form alpha helices
interrupted by turns. The C-terminal half of LGN contains 4 GoLoco
motifs (G-alpha-i/o-Loco), which are involved in guanine nucleotide
exchange. LGN also has several potential protein kinase phosphorylation
sites. RT-PCR detected LGN expression in all tissues examined.

Blumer et al. (2002) determined that human LGN shares 59% amino acid
identity with rat activator of G protein signaling-3 (AGS3, or GPSM1;
609491), with most similarity in the 7 N-terminal tetratricopeptide
repeat (TPR) motifs and the 4 C-terminal G protein regulatory motifs.
Western blot analysis detected Lgn in all rat tissues and specific brain
regions examined. Lgn was expressed in all cell lines tested and in
primary cultures of rat cortical neurons, astroglia, and microglia. In
primary neuronal cultures, Lgn was nonhomogeneously distributed in the
cell body, neuronal processes, and nucleus.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Blumer et al. (2002) mapped the GPSM2 gene
to chromosome 1p13.1.

GENE STRUCTURE

Blumer et al. (2002) determined that the GPSM2 gene contains 14 exons
and spans about 44.7 kb.

GENE FUNCTION

Blumer et al. (2002) found that activation of NMDA receptors (see
138252) and elevated intracellular calcium in primary rat neuronal
cultures caused redistribution of Lgn into punctate structures in the
cell body and neuronal processes. Distribution of Lgn was dynamic in
actively dividing rat pheochromocytoma cells and COS-7 cells. During the
cell cycle, Lgn relocalized from the nucleus to the midbody, where it
colocalized with F-actin at the site of daughter cell separation during
cytokinesis.

Nair et al. (2005) investigated the presence of a guanosine diphosphate
(GDP) dissociation inhibitor (GDI) for transducin (139330) in rod
photoreceptor cells. Western blot analysis showed Lgn (but not Ags3 or
Ags1) in mouse and bovine retina. By immunofluorescence microscopy of
mouse retinal sections, Lgn was localized mostly in the inner segments
and outer plexiform layer of photoreceptor cells in both light and dark
conditions. Lgn was present in the cytosol, membrane, and the
detergent-resistant cytoskeletal fraction. The ratio of Lgn to
transducin was at least 1:15. The alpha subunit of transducin in its
GDP-bound state interacted with endogenous and recombinant Lgn, and the
recombinant G protein regulatory motif of Lgn reduced the rate of
guanosine triphosphate (GTP) exchange. Nair et al. (2005) concluded that
photoreceptor inner segments contain Lgn, which can bind to the alpha
subunit of transducin and potentially regulate its function.

Walsh et al. (2010) evaluated inner ear expression of Gpsm2 in mice
using immunohistochemistry. There was embryonic and perinatal expression
of Gpsm2 at the apical surfaces of the hair and supporting cells in the
cochlea, utricle, saccule, and cristae. In the cochlea, Gpsm2
localization extended throughout the greater epithelial ridge. At
postnatal day (P) 0, cochlear hair cells showed asymmetric localization
of Gpsm2 at the lateral edge, a pattern that was not present in hair
cells at embryonic day (E) 16.5. Gpsm2 also localized in pillar cells in
P0 inner ears. By P15, Gpsm2 had disappeared at the apical surface of
the cells but persisted in pillar cells. In adult mice, Gpsm2 was
concentrated specifically in the head region of the inner pillar cells.
RT-PCR studies showed that Gpsm2 expression decreased rapidly between
E16.5 and P30, dropping to a level in adult mice that was approximately
20% of that at E16.5, indicating developmental regulation.

Using in vivo skin-specific lentiviral RNA interference, Williams et al.
(2011) investigated spindle orientation regulation and provided direct
evidence that LGN, NuMA (164009), and dynactin (DCTN1; 601143) are
involved. In compromising asymmetric cell divisions, Williams et al.
(2011) uncovered profound defects in stratification, differentiation,
and barrier formation, and implicate Notch (190198) signaling as an
important effector. Williams et al. (2011) concluded that asymmetric
cell division components act by reorienting mitotic spindles to achieve
perpendicular divisions, which in turn promote stratification and
differentiation. Furthermore, the resemblance between their knockdown
phenotypes and Rbpj (147183) loss-of-function mutants provided important
clues that suprabasal Notch signaling is impaired when asymmetric cell
divisions do not occur.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of a Palestinian kindred with Chudley-McCullough
syndrome (CMCS; 604213), Walsh et al. (2010) identified a homozygous
mutation in the GPSM2 gene (R127X; 609245.0001). All unaffected parents
were heterozygous for the mutation. The findings indicated that GPSM2 is
essential to the development of normal hearing, and Walsh et al. (2010)
postulated that the R127X mutation caused a defect in the maintenance of
cell polarity and spindle orientation in hair and supporting cells of
the developing inner ear. By homozygosity mapping followed by candidate
gene analysis, Yariz et al. (2012) identified a homozygous truncating
mutation in the GPSM2 gene (Q562X; 609245.0002) in affected members of a
consanguineous Turkish family with CMCS. Although the families reported
by Walsh et al. (2010) and Yariz et al. (2012) were originally reported
to have autosomal recessive nonsyndromic deafness 82 (DFNB82),
neuroimaging studies by Doherty et al. (2012) found abnormalities,
including short, thin corpus callosum, heterotopia, frontal
polymicrogyria, cerebellar dysplasia, and an arachnoid cyst, consistent
with a diagnosis of Chudley-McCullough syndrome.

By homozygosity mapping and whole-exome sequencing of patients with
Chudley-McCullough syndrome, Doherty et al. (2012) identified homozygous
or compound heterozygous mutations in the GPSM2 gene
(609245.0003-609245.0006). The disorder was characterized by severe to
profound deafness and characteristic brain abnormalities on
neuroimaging, including ventriculomegaly, partial agenesis of the corpus
callosum, heterotopia, frontal polymicrogyria, cerebellar dysplasia, and
arachnoid cysts. Despite these abnormalities, neurodevelopment was
essential normal, except in 1 child who had mild to moderate
intellectual disability. Only 2 patients had seizures, which were well
controlled. There were no apparent genotype/phenotype correlations.
Doherty et al. (2012) postulated that the disorder results from
asymmetric cell divisions in the brain during development.

ANIMAL MODEL

Lee et al. (2006) tested whether cell polarity genes, known to regulate
embryonic neuroblast asymmetric cell division, also regulate neuroblast
self-renewal. Clonal analysis in Drosophila larval brains showed that
pins mutant neuroblasts rapidly fail to self-renew, whereas lgl (600966)
mutant neuroblasts generate multiple neuroblasts. Notably, lgl pins
double-mutant neuroblasts all divide symmetrically to self-renew,
filling the brain with neuroblasts at the expense of neurons. The lgl
pins neuroblasts show ectopic cortical localization of atypical protein
kinase C (aPKC; see 176960), and a decrease in aPKC expression reduces
neuroblast numbers, suggesting that aPKC promotes neuroblast
self-renewal. In support of this hypothesis, Lee et al. (2006) found
that neuroblast-specific overexpression of membrane-targeted aPKC, but
not a kinase-dead version, induced ectopic neuroblast self-renewal. Lee
et al. (2006) concluded that cortical aPKC kinase activity is a potent
inducer of neuroblast self-renewal.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CHUDLEY-MCCULLOUGH SYNDROME
GPSM2, ARG127TER

In 7 members of a consanguineous Palestinian kindred with
Chudley-McCullough syndrome (CMCS; 604213), Walsh et al. (2010)
identified a homozygous 875C-T transition in the GPSM2 gene, resulting
in an arg127-to-ter (R127X) substitution that truncated the protein
between the second and third TPR motifs. Analysis of lymphoblast RNA
showed that the nonsense allele produced a stable mutant transcript. All
unaffected parents were heterozygous for the mutation. Walsh et al.
(2010) postulated a defect in the maintenance of cell polarity and
spindle orientation in hair and supporting cells of the developing inner
ear. Although the family was originally reported to have autosomal
recessive nonsyndromic deafness 82 (DFNB82), neuroimaging of 1 patient
by Doherty et al. (2012) found abnormalities, including short, thin
corpus callosum, heterotopia, frontal polymicrogyria, cerebellar
dysplasia, and an arachnoid cyst, consistent with a diagnosis of
Chudley-McCullough syndrome.

.0002
CHUDLEY-MCCULLOUGH SYNDROME
GPSM2, GLN562TER

In 3 affected members of a consanguineous Turkish kindred with CMCS
(604213), Yariz et al. (2012) identified a homozygous 1684C-T transition
in exon 15 of the GPSM2 gene, resulting in a gln562-to-ter (Q562X)
substitution in the second GoLoco motif repeat in the C terminus. The
mutation was predicted to interfere with the association of GPSM2 with
G-alpha subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins. Analysis of lymphoblast
RNA showed that the mutant transcript was stable. All unaffected parents
were heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found in 173 controls.
The mutation was identified by homozygosity mapping followed by
candidate gene analysis. Yariz et al. (2012) suggested that the hearing
loss was related to inadequate cell polarity relating to defective
spindle orientation, resulting in impaired hair cell transduction in the
inner ear. Although the family was originally reported to have autosomal
recessive nonsyndromic deafness 82 (DFNB82), neuroimaging of all 3
patients by Doherty et al. (2012) found abnormalities, including short,
thin corpus callosum, heterotopia, frontal polymicrogyria, arachnoid
cysts, and variable cerebellar dysplasia, consistent with a diagnosis of
Chudley-McCullough syndrome.

.0003
CHUDLEY-MCCULLOUGH SYNDROME
GPSM2, 1-BP DEL, 1473G

In 5 individuals from 4 Mennonite families with Chudley-McCullough
syndrome (CMCS; 604213), Doherty et al. (2012) identified a homozygous
1-bp deletion (1473delG) in the GPSM2 gene, predicted to result in a
frameshift and premature termination (Gly491GlyfsTer6). These
individuals shared a common disease haplotype, consistent with a founder
effect. The mutations were identified by whole-exome sequencing and
confirmed by Sanger sequencing.

.0004
CHUDLEY-MCCULLOUGH SYNDROME
GPSM2, 1-BP DEL, 741C

In 2 Mennonite sibs and an unrelated European American patient, all with
Chudley-McCullough syndrome (604213), Doherty et al. (2012) identified a
homozygous 1-bp deletion (742delC) in the GPSM2 gene, predicted to cause
a frameshift and premature termination (Asn247AsnfsTer34). Affected sibs
of Dutch ancestry with the disorder were compound heterozygous for
741delC and a premature termination mutation (S554X; 609245.0005).

.0005
CHUDLEY-MCCULLOUGH SYNDROME
GPSM2, SER554TER (dbSNP rs145191476)

In sibs of Dutch ancestry with Chudley-McCullough syndrome (604213),
Doherty et al. (2012) identified compound heterozygosity for a 1-bp
deletion in the GPSM2 gene (609245.0004) on the paternal allele and a
1661C-A transversion, resulting in a ser554-to-ter (S554X) substitution,
on the maternal allele. This variant, which was found in the
heterozygous state in 1 of 3,510 subjects in the Exome Sequencing
Project, was designated dbSNP rs145191476.

.0006
CHUDLEY-MCCULLOUGH SYNDROME
GPSM2, IVS9DS, G-T, +1

In 2 Mexican American sibs with Chudley-McCullough syndrome (604213),
Doherty et al. (2012) identified a homozygous G-to-T transversion in the
donor splice site of exon 9 of the GPSM2 gene. The mutation caused a
transcript missing exon 9 and was predicted to result in a truncated
protein (R318RfsX8). The mutation was not found in 3,510 European
American individuals.

605799	TITLE *605799 AMNIONLESS, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; AMN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The Amn gene, mutant in the 'amnionless' mouse, encodes a type I
transmembrane protein that is expressed exclusively in the
extraembryonic visceral endoderm layer during gastrulation.

CLONING

Fate-mapping experiments in the mouse have revealed that the primitive
streak can be divided into 3 functional regions: the proximal region
gives rise to the germ cells and the extraembryonic mesoderm of the yolk
sac; the distal region generates cardiac mesoderm and node-derived axial
mesendoderm; and the middle streak region produces the paraxial,
intermediate, and lateral plate mesoderm of the trunk. To gain insight
into the mechanisms that mediate the assembly of the primitive streak
into these functional regions, Kalantry et al. (2001) cloned and
functionally identified the gene disrupted in the amnionless mouse,
which has a recessive embryonic lethal mutation that interferes
specifically with the formation and/or specification of the middle
primitive streak region during gastrulation. The extracellular region of
the Amn protein contains a cysteine-rich domain with similarity to bone
morphogenetic protein (BMP)-binding cysteine-rich domains in chordin
(603475), its Drosophila homolog 'short gastrulation' (Sog), and
procollagen IIA (120140). Alignment of the predicted amino acid
sequences of the Drosophila, human, and mouse genes indicate that the
N-terminal portion, together with the cysteine-rich module, is the most
conserved segment of AMN. Amn acts in the visceral endoderm to affect
cell behaviors in the adjacent epiblast. The apical location of Amn
places it on the opposite side of the visceral endoderm from the
epiblast; therefore, Amn is unlikely to interact directly with epiblast
cells. Kalantry et al. (2001) proposed that AMN modulates a BMP
signaling pathway within the visceral endoderm to direct the production
of a set of gene products that interact directly with epiblast cells and
influence their behavior. Unlike chordin and Sog, AMN is
transmembrane-bound. This indicates that AMN might modulate BMP receptor
function by serving as an accessory or coreceptor that, through its
cysteine-rich domain, facilitates or hinders BMP binding.

The human AMN gene is predicted to encode a 454-amino acid protein
(Kalantry et al., 2001).

Dunn and Hogan (2001) discussed the work of Kalantry et al. (2001) in
the context of the role of extraembryonic signals in embryonic
patterning.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tanner et al. (2003) determined that the AMN gene comprises 12 exons
encoding at least 5 protein products.

GENE FUNCTION

Fyfe et al. (2004) showed that cubilin (CUBN; 602997), a protein that
recognizes intrinsic factor (IF)-cobalamin and various other proteins to
be endocytosed in the intestine and kidney, respectively, and AMN
colocalize in the endocytic apparatus of polarized epithelial cells and
copurify as a tight complex during IF-cobalamin affinity and
nondenaturing gel filtration chromatography. In transfected cells
expressing either AMN or a truncated IF-cobalamin-binding cubilin
construct, neither protein alone conferred ligand endocytosis. Other
studies indicated that cubilin and AMN are subunits of a novel
cubilin/AMN (cubam) complex, where AMN binds to the N-terminal third of
cubilin and directs subcellular localization and endocytosis of cubilin
with its ligand. Fyfe et al. (2004) concluded that mutations affecting
either of the 2 proteins may abrogate function of the cubam complex and
cause Imerslund-Grasbeck syndrome (261100).

MAPPING

Kalantry et al. (2001) assembled an EST contig corresponding to the
human AMN gene. By sequence identity between this contig and a BAC clone
(GenBank GENBANK AL133455), they mapped the human AMN gene to 14q32. AMN
resides between TRAF3 (601896) and CDC42BPB (614062), in the same
transcriptional orientation as TRAF3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Autosomal recessive hereditary megaloblastic anemia (MGA1; 261100) was
described simultaneously in Norway by Imerslund (1960) and in Finland by
Grasbeck et al. (1960). Aminoff et al. (1999) showed that MGA1 is caused
in Finnish cases by homozygous mutations of the CUBN gene, which encodes
a receptor for the intrinsic factor-vitamin B12 complex. Unexpectedly,
however, Norwegian individuals showing the MGA1 phenotype did not have
mutations in CUBN. Using samples from these Norwegian families, Tanner
et al. (2003) carried out a genomewide search, established linkage to
14q, and narrowed the critical region to that containing the AMN gene.
AMN emerged as a clear candidate because of its high expression in the
kidney. Tanner et al. (2003) screened the AMN gene in 5 families and
identified homozygosity for one or another of 3 AMN mutations in all 11
affected individuals, with heterozygosity in the 5 parents available for
study.

It is a paradox that homozygous inactivation of Amn causes an embryonic
lethal condition in mice, whereas homozygous mutations in human AMN
cause only the mild MGA1 phenotype. As all mutations resulting in MGA1
occurred toward the N-terminal end of the gene, this part of the gene
might not be essential for embryonic development but might be for
vitamin B12 uptake. By in vitro protein expression analysis, Tanner et
al. (2003) showed that the AMN gene encodes at least 5 protein products.
Further studies confirmed that the MGA1 mutations allowed truncated AMN
translation. The authors postulated that the truncated AMN products are
important for embryonic development and thereby preclude a lethal
phenotype as seen in the amnionless mouse.

Evidence of mutations in a single gene, such as AMN, causing 2 or more
distinct phenotypes is an exception to the dogma of 1 gene, 1 protein, 1
function. Thus, AMN/Amn can be added to the short list of 'moonlighting
proteins' (Jeffery, 1999). Other examples include laminin A/C (LMNA;
150330), mutations in which cause related phenotypes that suggest a
common mechanism; a notable example is ERCC2 (126340), which apparently
has 2 distinct functions in DNA repair and transcription and causes 3
distinct diseases (Lehmann, 2001) when mutated.

ANIMAL MODEL

The mouse mutation 'amnionless' was originally so named because on some
genetic backgrounds homozygotes lack the amnion (Wang et al., 1996;
Tomihara-Newberger et al., 1998). More striking, however, is that Amn
mutants lack a trunk. Embryos that survive to the tenth day of
gastrulation have headfolds, a beating heart, and abundant posterior
mesoderm; however, in between these tissues is none of the mesoderm that
produces the limb buds, dermis, muscle, vertebrae, and other organs of
the trunk (Tomihara-Newberger et al., 1998). Analysis of marker genes
expressed regionally indicates that the phenotype originates from
mispatterning of epiblast cells in the middle levels so that they
acquire a more posterior fate. The Amn mouse has an insertional mutation
generated by the integration of a human CD8-alpha transgene into distal
mouse chromosome 12, downstream from the 3-prime end of Traf3 (601896).
By in situ hybridization analysis of wildtype blastocysts and early
postimplantation-stage embryos, Kalantry et al. (2001) demonstrated that
Amn is first transcribed in the primitive endoderm at embryonic day 4.5.
Amn expression was specifically in the visceral endoderm at all
subsequent stages of gastrulation examined. The Amn protein is localized
to the apical surface of the visceral endoderm cells at embryonic day
6.0 and 7.5. A similar distribution of Amn was detected at embryonic day
5.5; in particular, Amn is expressed throughout the visceral endoderm
and is not localized to either the posterior or anterior side of the
embryo. The expression pattern indicates that Amn functions exclusively
in the visceral endoderm to direct epiblast growth and assembly of the
middle primitive streak.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MEGALOBLASTIC ANEMIA 1, NORWEGIAN TYPE
AMN, 1-BP DEL, 14G

In 3 Norwegian families with recessive hereditary megaloblastic anemia
(261100), Tanner et al. (2003) found deletion of nucleotide 14 in exon 1
(14delG) of the AMN gene, leading to termination at codon 16.

.0002
MEGALOBLASTIC ANEMIA 1, NORWEGIAN TYPE
AMN, THR41ILE

In a Norwegian family, Tanner et al. (2003) found that megaloblastic
anemia (261100) was associated with a C-to-T transition at nucleotide
122 in exon 2 (122C-T) of the AMN gene, predicted to result in a
threonine-to-isoleucine substitution (T41I). The substitution changed
the side chain from polar to nonpolar. Residue 41 is 100% conserved in
human, mouse, and rat homologs.

.0003
MEGALOBLASTIC ANEMIA 1
AMN, IVS3, A-G, -2

In a Tunisian Jewish family with megaloblastic anemia (261100), Tanner
et al. (2003) found that the disorder was associated with a change from
CAG to CGG in the acceptor splice site of intron 3 (208-2A-G) of the AMN
gene. RT-PCR analysis showed that this splice mutation caused complete
skipping of exon 4 (88 bp) with a subsequent frameshift and premature
termination in exon 6. This and the other 2 mutations found by Tanner et
al. (2003) were homozygous in all 11 affected individuals from 5
families and heterozygous in the 5 parents available for study.

Bouchlaka et al. (2007) reported a Tunisian family with MGA1 caused by
the 208-2A-G mutation. Since the mutation had been previously reported
in a Jewish Israeli family of Tunisian origin and in Turkish families,
the authors suggested a founder effect originating in the Mediterranean
basin.

609635	TITLE *609635 TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 23; TCF23
;;OUT
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Narumi et al. (2000) identified a novel mouse basic helix-loop-helix
(bHLH) factor, Tcf23, which is expressed predominantly in the
reproductive organs such as the uterus and ovary.

Using in silico methods, Tachibana et al. (2001) identified the human
ortholog of mouse Tcf23.

GENE FUNCTION

Narumi et al. (2000) found that the mouse Tcf23 protein has an
inhibitory activity similar to those of Id proteins (see 600349) that
are negative regulators of bHLH factors.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tachibana et al. (2001) determined that both the human and mouse TCF23
genes contain 3 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Tachibana et al. (2001) mapped the TCF23
gene to chromosome 2p24-p23. By FISH, they mapped the mouse Tcf23 gene
to the A3 region of chromosome 5.

603464	TITLE *603464 CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE 10; CDK10
;;PISSLRE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are CDC2 (116940)-related kinases that
bind to cyclin to form active holoenzymes that play a pivotal role in
the regulation of the eukaryotic cell cycle. To identify additional
CDC2-like protein kinases, Brambilla and Draetta (1994) performed RT-PCR
on human tumor cell line mRNA using degenerate oligonucleotides based on
regions conserved among CDC2- related proteins. They used a resulting
PCR product to screen a HeLa cell library and isolated a partial cDNA
encoding a novel protein kinase. The 5-prime end of the cDNA was
obtained using RACE. Brambilla and Draetta (1994) designated the
predicted 360-amino acid protein PISSLRE, based on the amino acid
sequence of the region corresponding to the conserved CDC2 PSTAIRE
motif. PISSLRE contains all the structural elements characteristic of
CDKs and unique extensions at both ends. Sequence comparisons revealed
that it shares 41% and 50% protein sequence identity with CDC2 and
CDC2L1 (176873), respectively. By Northern blot analysis, the authors
determined that PISSLRE was expressed broadly in human tissues as a 2-kb
mRNA. An additional 3.5-kb transcript was observed in some tissues.

GENE STRUCTURE

Using a combination of library screening and 5-prime RACE, Grana et al.
(1994) isolated PISSLRE cDNAs that differed significantly at both ends
from those isolated by Brambilla and Draetta (1994). Brambilla and
Draetta (1994) attributed the differences to alternative splicing. Grana
et al. (1994) were unable to identify any ATG initiation codons upstream
of the sequence encoding the catalytic domain of the putative kinase.
They suggested that translation may initiate at 1 of 3 non-ATG
initiation codons.

Crawford et al. (1999) characterized the genomic structure of PISSLRE
and found that the splicing of the gene is complex. They identified a
variety of different transcripts, including those due to cryptic splice
sites, exon skipping, insertion of intronic sequences, and exon
scrambling.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids, Bullrich et al. (1995) mapped the
CDK10 gene to 16q24.

;;CD36 ANTIGEN-LIKE 1; CD36L1;;
CD36 AND LIMPII ANALOGOUS 1; CLA1;;
SCAVENGER RECEPTOR, CLASS B, TYPE I; SRBI; SRB1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Scavenger receptor class B type I (SRBI) mediates the bidirectional
transfer of cholesterol between cells and high density lipoprotein
cholesterol (HDL) (summary by Vergeer et al., 2011).

CLONING

Using degenerate PCR, Calvo and Vega (1993) isolated a novel sequence
closely related to both the CD36 thrombospondin/collagen receptor
(173510) and to lysosomal integral membrane protein II (LIMPII; 602257).
This novel gene was termed CLA1 for 'CD36 and LIMPII analogous-1.' Calvo
and Vega (1993) isolated 2 alternatively spliced CLA1 cDNAs predicting
proteins of 409 and 509 amino acids from a human placenta cDNA library.
Calvo and Vega (1993) stated that the full-length CLA1 sequence predicts
a glycoprotein having 2 transmembrane domains, 2 short cytoplasmic
tails, and a large extracellular loop. They used immunofluorescence to
show that the protein is found on the plasma membrane. Northern blot
analysis revealed a 2.9-kb mRNA in several cell lines.

MAPPING

Calvo et al. (1995) used PCR analysis of human-hamster hybrids to map
the CD36L1 gene to human chromosome 12. They stated that CD36, CD36L1,
and CD36L2 represent a gene family, but that this family is not
clustered in the genome; these genes map to chromosomes 7, 12, and 4,
respectively. Cao et al. (1997) mapped the SCARB1 gene to 12q24.2-qter
by FISH. From the mapping of a QTL for internal carotid artery intimal
medial thickness with chromosome 12 to a site 161 cM from 12pter, it was
found by Fox et al. (2004) that SCARB1 is in close proximity.

GENE FUNCTION

High density lipoprotein (HDL) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) are
cholesterol transport particles whose plasma concentrations are directly
(in the case of LDL) and inversely (in the case of HDL) correlated with
risk for atherosclerosis. LDL metabolism involves cellular uptake and
degradation of the entire particle by a well-characterized receptor
(606945). HDL, in contrast, selectively delivers its cholesterol, but
not protein, to cells. Acton et al. (1996) showed that the mouse HDL
receptor involved in this selective delivery of cholesterol is the class
B scavenger receptor they referred to as SR-BI. This receptor binds HDL
with high affinity, is expressed primarily in liver and nonplacental
steroidogenic tissues, and mediates selective cholesterol uptake by a
mechanism distinct from the classic LDL receptor pathway. The authors
distinguished this receptor activity from that of other HDL-binding
proteins (e.g., 142695). By analogy with the LDL system, a key missing
element in the study of HDL metabolism had been a well-defined HDL
receptor, which could give a molecular and cellular handle on the
system. The class B type I scavenger receptor was the first molecularly
well-characterized HDL receptor.

The murine scavenger receptor type B class I (SRBI) has affinity for
high density lipoproteins (HDLs) and mediates the selective uptake of
cholesterol esters. Murao et al. (1997) noted that SRBI shares 81%
sequence identity with the longer (509 amino acid) form of human CLA1.
By Northern blot analysis, Murao et al. (1997) demonstrated that the
2.9-kb CLA1 message is expressed most strongly in human adrenal gland
and also in liver and testis. Murao et al. (1997) suggested that CLA1,
like SRBI, could play a role in the metabolism of HDL. However, CLA1 was
also expressed in monocytes and, like SRBI, recognized modified forms of
low density lipoproteins as well as native LDL and anionic
phospholipids. Murao et al. (1997) found that CLA1 bound selectively to
apoptotic thymocytes. Murao et al. (1997) suggested that CLA1 may have 2
distinct roles, functioning both as a mediator of HDL uptake in the
liver and steroidogenic tissues, and having an alternative role in
leukocytes.

Murao et al. (1997) and Cao et al. (1997) demonstrated that SRBI is
expressed in humans at high levels in precisely those tissues that
previously had been shown to exhibit the bulk of selective uptake of HDL
cholesterol in vivo. The temporal and spatial expression of SRBI during
murine embryogenesis was consistent with a role of SRBI in delivering
cholesterol to the developing fetus. Additional correlative evidence of
a role of SRBI in HDL cholesterol metabolism came from studies of the
effects on SRBI expression of hormones, which induce or suppress steroid
hormone synthesis. To address the role of SRBI in HDL cholesterol
homeostasis, mice were generated bearing an SRBI promoter mutation that
resulted in decreased expression of the receptor in homozygous mutant
mice (Varban et al., 1998). Hepatic expression of the receptor was
reduced by 53% with a corresponding increase in total plasma cholesterol
levels of 50 to 70%, attributable almost exclusively to elevated plasma
HDL. In addition to the increased HDL cholesteryl esters, HDL
phospholipids and apoA1 (107680) levels were elevated and there was an
increase in HDL particle size in mutant mice. Metabolic studies using
HDL-bearing nondegradable radiolabels in both the protein and lipid
components demonstrated that reduced hepatic SRBI expression by half was
associated with a decrease of 47% in selective uptake of cholesteryl
esters by the liver, and a corresponding reduction of 53% in selective
removal of HDL cholesteryl esters from plasma. Taken together, these
findings strongly supported a pivotal role for hepatic SRBI expression
in regulating plasma HDL levels and indicated that SRBI is the major
molecular mediating selective cholesteryl ester uptake by the liver. The
inverse correlation between plasma HDL levels and atherosclerosis
further suggests that SRBI may influence the development of coronary
artery disease. See Krieger (1998) for a comparison of the HDL and LDL
receptor systems.

Ikemoto et al. (2000) identified an SRBI-associated protein from rat
liver membrane extracts by using an affinity chromatography technique.
The protein contains 4 PDZ domains (see 603199 for a discussion of PDZ)
and associates with the C terminus of rat SRBI by using its N-terminal
first PDZ domain; see 603831.

Scarselli et al. (2002) determined that SCARB1 is a receptor for
hepatitis C virus glycoprotein E2. Binding between SCARB1 and E2 was
found to be independent of the genotype of the viral isolate.

Using a genomewide RNA interference screen in Drosophila macrophage-like
cells using Mycobacterium fortuitum, Philips et al. (2005) identified
factors required for general phagocytosis, as well as those needed
specifically for mycobacterial infection. One specific factor, Peste
(Pes), is a CD36 family member required for uptake of mycobacteria, but
not E. coli or S. aureus. Moreover, mammalian class B scavenger
receptors (SRs) conferred uptake of bacteria into nonphagocytic cells,
with SR-BI and SR-BII (602257) uniquely mediating uptake of M.
fortuitum, which suggests a conserved role for class B SRs in pattern
recognition and innate immunity.

Vishnyakova et al. (2006) found that transfection of embryonic kidney
and HeLa cell lines with CLA1 and its splice variant, CLA2, enhanced
uptake of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
Lipopolysaccharide and lipoteichoic acid competed with E. coli K12 for
CLA1 and CLA2 binding. Transmission electron microscopy and confocal
microscopy analyses revealed cytosolic accumulation of bacteria in cells
overexpressing CLA1/CLA2. In the presence of antibiotics, E. coli K12
survived and replicated intracellularly, but synthetic amphipathic
helical peptides prevented E. coli K12 invasion. Peritoneal macrophages
from mice lacking Cla1/Cla2 showed reduced bacterial uptake, as well as
decreased bacterial cytosolic invasion, ubiquitination, and proteasome
mobilization, whereas bacterial lysosomal accumulation was unaffected.
Vishnyakova et al. (2006) proposed that these CLA1/CLA2-mediated
intracellular events may facilitate infection with certain intracellular
pathogens, such as hepatitis C virus, and/or represent a mechanism of
pathogen recognition, ubiquitination, and degradation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 77 subjects who were heterozygous for familial hypercholesterolemia
(143890), Tai et al. (2003) examined the association of plasma lipid
concentrations with 3 common polymorphisms of the SRBI gene, which is a
candidate gene involved in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis. Two
polymorphisms, one in exon 1 and one in exon 8, were associated with
variation in plasma concentrations of fasting triglyceride. In addition,
the exon 8 polymorphism was associated with change in lipoprotein
levels. In agreement with animal studies, the data suggested a role for
SRBI in the metabolism of apolipoprotein B (APOB; 107730)-containing
lipoproteins in humans. Tai et al. (2003) suggested that this pathway
may constitute a backup mechanism to LDL receptor-mediated pathways for
the catabolism of these lipoproteins, and could be particularly relevant
in subjects with high levels of apoB-containing lipoproteins, such as
those occurring in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia.

Decreased HDL cholesterol and raised triglyceride levels are well known
risk factors for atherosclerosis. McCarthy et al. (2003) examined
polymorphisms in the HDL receptor gene SCARB1 in 371 white patients with
coronary artery disease to determine their association with plasma
lipids. They found an association between a combination of genotypes in
women but not in men. McCarthy et al. (2003) concluded that genetic
variants in SCARB1 may be an important determinant of abnormal
lipoproteins in women and confer particular susceptibility to coronary
artery disease. They referred to the findings of Herrington et al.
(2002) that a differential response of HDL cholesterol to hormone
replacement therapy is dependent on the presence of genetic variants of
the estrogen receptor gene (133430.0004), and suggested that SCARB1
variants may also modulate the effect of hormone replacement therapy on
plasma lipid levels in women.

Acton et al. (1999) reported 3 common polymorphisms associated with
plasma lipids and body mass index. Osgood et al. (2003) hypothesized
that diabetic status may interact with these polymorphisms in
determining plasma lipid concentrations and particle size. They
evaluated this hypothesis in 2,463 nondiabetic (49% men) and 187
diabetic (64% men) participants in the Framingham Study. After
multivariate adjustment, they found a consistent association between the
exon 8 polymorphism and high density lipoprotein cholesterol
concentration and particle size. Interaction effects were not
significant for exon 8 and intron 5 polymorphisms. However, Osgood et
al. (2003) found statistically significant interactions between SCARB1
exon 1 genotypes and type 2 diabetes (125853), indicating that diabetic
subjects with the less common allele have lower lipid concentrations.
The authors concluded that SCARB1 gene variation modulates the lipid
profile, particularly in type 2 diabetes, contributing to the metabolic
abnormalities in these subjects.

Perez-Martinez et al. (2005) studied if a G-to-A polymorphism in exon 1
of the SCARB1 gene modifies the insulin sensitivity to dietary fat. They
studied 59 healthy volunteers. Steady-state plasma glucose after a
monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) diet was lower in G/A compared with
G/G subjects. Plasma nonesterified free fatty acid values were lower in
subjects carrying the less common A allele for all the diet periods. The
authors concluded that carriers of the G/A genotype have significant
increases in insulin sensitivity after a MUFA-rich diet compared with
G/G individuals. There were no homozygotes for the A allele.

Teslovich et al. (2010) performed a genomewide association study for
plasma lipids in more than 100,000 individuals of European ancestry and
reported 95 significantly associated loci (P = less than 5 x 10(-8)),
with 59 showing genomewide significant association with lipid traits for
the first time. The newly reported associations included SNPs near known
lipid regulators (e.g., CYP7A1, 118455; NPC1L1, 608010; and SCARB1) as
well as in scores of loci not previously implicated in lipoprotein
metabolism. The 95 loci contributed not only to normal variation in
lipid traits but also to extreme lipid phenotypes and had an impact on
lipid traits in 3 non-European populations (East Asians, South Asians,
and African Americans).

Vergeer et al. (2011) identified a missense mutation, P297S
(601040.0001), in the SCARB1 gene that was associated with elevated HDL
cholesterol levels (see HDLCQ6, 610762) but no other differences in
lipid profile parameters, atherosclerosis, or carotoid intima-media
thickness. However, carriers of the P297S variant showed decreased
platelet aggregation and a reduction in cholesterol efflux from
monocyte-macrophages. Carriers also had decreased adrenal
steroidogenesis. Khovidhunkit (2011) commented that the study by Vergeer
et al. (2011) did not distinguish whether the diminished adrenal
function in the carriers of the P297S mutation was primary or secondary,
and suggested measuring corticotropin levels to differentiate. Vergeer
et al. (2011) replied that there was no difference in median
corticotropin levels between the 15 P297S carriers and the 15
noncarriers, indicating that there was no pituitary defect. Vergeer et
al. (2011) suggested that the P297S mutation in the SCARB1 cholesterol
transporter directly impairs the adrenal uptake of cholesterol as a
substrate for steriodogenesis, leading to a primary defect in adrenal
function in human carriers.

Brunham et al. (2011) sequenced the SCARB1 gene in 120 Caucasian
probands with plasma HDL cholesterol levels at or above the 90th
percentile adjusted for age and gender, and in 80 Caucasian individuals
with HDLC below the 10th percentile, with no other lipid abnormalities.
In 2 probands with high HDLC, they identified 2 missense mutations
(601040.0002 and 601040.0003) that segregated with HDL cholesterol
levels in each family and were not found in the 80 individuals with low
HDLC levels or in the dbSNP or 1000 Genomes databases.

ANIMAL MODEL

Miettinen et al. (2001) generated Scarb1 knockout mice and observed that
null females had abnormal HDLs, ovulated dysfunctional oocytes, and were
infertile. Fertility was restored when the structure and/or quantity of
abnormal HDL was altered by inactivating the Apoa1 gene or administering
the cholesterol-lowering drug probucol. Miettinen et al. (2001)
suggested that abnormal lipoprotein metabolism can cause infertility in
mice and may contribute to some forms of human female infertility.

SCARB1, PRO297SER

Among a cohort of 162 unrelated white participants with an HDL
cholesterol level above the 95th percentile (see HDLCQ6, 610762),
Vergeer et al. (2011) identified an individual who carried a C-to-T
transition at nucleotide 889 of the SCARB1 gene, resulting in a
proline-to-serine substitution at codon 297 (P297S). This mutation was
not found in 150 normolipidemic controls. The proline at this position
is highly conserved across species. Vergeer et al. (2011) investigated
18 further carrier members of the proband's family and compared them to
36 family noncarrier controls matched according to BMI, sex, and age on
an aggregate basis. Carriers had significantly increased HDL cholesterol
levels (70.4 mg per deciliter vs 53.4 mg per deciliter in noncarriers; p
less than 0.001) but no significant differences in levels of other
plasma lipids. Vergeer et al. (2011) found no difference in the
prevalence of cardiovascular disease between carriers and noncarriers,
and no difference in carotid intima-media thickness. Among carriers,
Vergeer et al. (2011) identified decreased platelet aggregation in
response to different agonists compared with noncarriers, as well as
decreased adrenal steroidogenesis. Cholesterol uptake from HDL by
primary murine hepatocytes that expressed mutant SRB1 protein was
reduced by 56% of that of hepatocytes expressing wildtype SRB1 (p less
than 0.001).

SCARB1, THR175ALA

In a 50-year-old Caucasian man with HDL cholesterol (HDLC) levels above
the 95th percentile when adjusted for age and gender (HDLCQ6; 610762),
Brunham et al. (2011) identified heterozygosity for a 776A-G
transversion in the SCARB1 gene, resulting in a thr175-to-ala (T175A)
substitution at a highly conserved residue in the large extracellular
loop. The mutation was present in the proband's 2 sons, who also had
HDLC levels above the 95th percentile, and in the proband's brother,
whose HDLC level was at the 71st percentile but who also had
hypertension and was taking medication that might influence the
phenotype. The mutation was not found in other family members with HDLC
levels less than the 95th percentile, in 80 unrelated Caucasian
individuals with HDLC levels below the 10th percentile, or in the dbSNP
or 1000 Genomes databases.

SCARB1, SER112PHE

In a 51-year-old Caucasian man with HDL cholesterol levels above the
95th percentile when adjusted for age and gender (HDLCQ6; 610762),
Brunham et al. (2011) identified heterozygosity for a 588C-T transition
in the SCARB1 gene, resulting in a ser112-to-phe (S112F) substitution at
a highly conserved residue in the large extracellular loop. The mutation
was not found in 80 unrelated Caucasian individuals with HDLC levels
below the 10th percentile, or in the dbSNP or 1000 Genomes databases.
However, the proband's 76-year-old mother, who was also heterozygous for
S112F, had an HDLC level in the 15th percentile, with early-onset
cerebrovascular disease at 55 years of age as well as later coronary
artery disease. Analysis of 3 genes known to be associated with low HDLC
levels revealed that his mother also carried a heterozygous missense
mutation in the ABCA1 gene (V2091I), suggesting that ABCA1 mutations may
be dominant to SCARB1 mutations with respect to HDLC.

611501	TITLE *611501 CALMODULIN-BINDING TRANSCRIPTION ACTIVATOR 1; CAMTA1
;;KIAA0833
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned CAMTA1, which they designated
KIAA0833. RT-PCR ELISA detected moderate expression in adult brain and
in all specific brain regions examined. Little to no expression was
detected in all other tissues examined, including fetal brain.

Nakajima et al. (2002) obtained a full-length CAMTA1 cDNA. The deduced
protein contains 1,734 amino acids.

By searching for genes similar to a plant Camta, Bouche et al. (2002)
identified human CAMTA1 and CAMTA2 (611508). Both deduced proteins
contain an N-terminal DNA-binding CG1 domain, followed by a central
transcription factor immunoglobulin (TIG) domain, 2 ankyrin repeats for
protein-protein interactions, and 4 C-terminal calmodulin
(114180)-binding IQ motifs. The CG1 domain includes a nuclear
localization signal.

By searching for genes in a region of chromosome 1 frequently deleted in
neuroblastomas, Katoh and Katoh (2003) identified CAMTA1. The deduced
protein contains 1,673 amino acids and shares 94.1% identity with mouse
Camta1.

By immunohistochemical analysis of a neuroblastoma cell line, Nakatani
et al. (2004) found that CAMTA1 was cytosolic.

Thevenon et al. (2012) found that embryonic mice had global brain
expression of Camta1 that became restricted to the cerebellum,
hippocampi, and olfactory bulbs later in development. Camta1 was
expressed in the whole brain at embryonic day 15.5. At embryonic day
18.5, staining was marked in the cortical plate and reduced in the
ventricular zone. The olfactory system and the cerebellar anlage were
also positive. At P4, staining was found in the olfactory system, the
superficial layer of the cortical plate, the gyrus dentate of the
hippocampus, and in the vermian external granular layer of the
cerebellum. At P14, staining was restricted to the olfactory system and
the internal granular layer of the cerebellar vermis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Katoh and Katoh (2003) determined that the CAMTA1 gene contains 23
exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the CAMTA1
gene to chromosome 1. Nakatani et al. (2004) stated that the CAMTA1 gene
maps to chromosome 1p36.

GENE FUNCTION

Bouche et al. (2002) found that CAMTA1 and CAMTA2 activated
transcription of a reporter gene in yeast.

Song et al. (2006) showed that mouse Camta1 and Camta2 activated the Anf
(NPPA; 108780) promoter.

Using RT-PCR, Nakatani et al. (2004) found that expression of CAMTA1 was
highest in S and M phases and lowest in G0/G1 phase in synchronized
neuroblastoma cells. CAMTA2 levels did not change with the cell cycle.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using array CGH, Thevenon et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous
intragenic deletion in the CAMTA1 gene (611501.0001) in affected members
of a large family with early-onset nonprogressive cerebellar ataxia and
mild mental retardation (CANPMR; 614756). Another family with a similar
phenotype had a heterozygous intragenic duplication in the CAMTA1 gene
(611501.0002). Both of these disruptions were predicted to lead to a
frameshift and premature termination. An unrelated child with ataxia but
milder cognitive involvement had a different in-frame deletion within
the gene (611501.0003). All of the rearrangements affected the CG1
domain of the protein. DNA sequencing analysis of the CAMTA1 gene in a
cohort of 197 patients with intellectual disability or nonprogressive
cerebellar ataxia did not identify any point mutations, suggesting that
microrearrangements of the CAMTA1 are the most frequent mutations.

CAMTA1, 81-KB DEL, EX4

In affected members of a family with nonprogressive cerebellar ataxia
with mild mental retardation (CANPMR; 614756), Thevenon et al. (2012)
identified a heterozygous 81-kb deletion in the DNA-binding CG1 domain
of the CAMTA1 gene, resulting in the deletion of exon 4, a frameshift,
and premature termination. The deletion was identified using array CGH,
and the effects were confirmed by analysis of mRNA from patient
fibroblasts. In this family, 2 adult half sisters had mild mental
retardation, attended schools for special needs, and worked at simple
jobs. Both had ataxic gait with static instability; 1 had mild intention
tremor. Brain MRI of both women showed mild hippocampal atrophy,
simplified gyration of the dentate gyri, posterior cortical atrophy, and
cerebellar atrophy. PET scan of 1 woman showed hypometabolism of several
cerebral brain regions. One of the women had 2 affected sons, and the
other had 3 affected children. All patients had mental retardation,
usually with delayed psychomotor development, and all had gait
instability or frank ataxia. More variable features included strabismus,
infantile hypotonia, delayed speech, and myoclonic seizures of the upper
arm (1 patient). Some patients had mild dysmorphic facial features. The
mother of the women reportedly had mild intellectual disability.

In affected members of a family with nonprogressive cerebellar ataxia
and mild mental retardation (614756), Thevenon et al. (2012) identified
a heterozygous 539-kb duplication in the CG1 domain of the CAMTA1 gene.
RT-PCR analysis of patient fibroblasts showed only normal mRNA; the
quantity of mutant mRNA was lower than the sensitivity of the
experiment. In this family, a mother and her son and daughter were
affected. All had mild intellectual disability, and the mother and
daughter had ataxic gait. The 2 children had delayed psychomotor
development with speech delay. One had neonatal hypotonia and the other
had autistic features, poor interactive skills, and bursts of
aggression. Mild facial dysmorphism was noted.

In a girl with nonprogressive cerebellar ataxia with mild mental
retardation (614756), Thevenon et al. (2012) identified a de novo
heterozygous 49-kb deletion in the CG1 domain of the CAMTA1 gene,
resulting in the deletion of exons 2-3, which would not alter the
reading frame. The developmental delay in this child was not as severe
as in those with truncating mutations (see 611501.0001 and 611501.0002).

607982	TITLE *607982 SCY1-LIKE 1; SCYL1
;;N-TERMINAL KINASE-LIKE; NTKL
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Liu et al. (2000) cloned mouse Scyl1, which they called p105, from an
adipocyte cell line cDNA library. The deduced 806-amino acid protein has
a calculated molecular mass of about 89 kD. Scyl1 shares significant
sequence similarity with kinases, but its putative kinase domain lacks
subdomain 1 of the 12 characteristic subdomains, and it is missing
highly conserved residues in other subdomains, suggesting that Scyl1 is
not a functional kinase. Western blot analysis of mouse tissues found
that Scyl1 has an apparent molecular mass of about 105 kD and is present
in all tissues examined. Western blot analysis of subcellular fractions
indicated that mouse Scyl1 is primarily cytosolic and that it is present
in low density microsomes.

By large-scale sequencing of a mammary gland cDNA library, followed by
nested PCR and 5-prime RACE, Kato et al. (2002) cloned SCYL1, which they
called NTKL. The deduced 808-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 89.6 kD. Kato et al. (2002) also cloned 2 splice
variants that harbor internal deletions and encode proteins of 791 and
707 amino acids, which they termed variant 1 and variant 2,
respectively. NTKL has an N-terminal kinase-like domain and a C-terminal
cluster of basic amino acids. NTKL shares 90% amino acid identity with
mouse Ntkl, and like mouse Ntkl, it does not contain kinase subdomain 1.
NTKL also shares sequence similarity with the S. cerevisiae Scy1
protein. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.8-kb transcript in all
tissues tested.

GENE FUNCTION

Using NTKL carrying 2 different epitope tags, Kato et al. (2002) found
that NTKL forms multimers following transfection into COS-7 cells. They
determined that NTKL forms a 300-kD trimer using crosslinking reagents.
Biochemical analysis revealed no phosphorylation or autophosphorylation
activity. Kato et al. (2002) found that the 707-amino acid NTKL variant,
variant 2, localized to centrosomes during mitosis. During interphase,
fluorescence-tagged variant 2 localized in the cytoplasm as well as
centrosomes. However, at the beginning of mitosis, the fluorescence
appeared as a pair of bright nuclear foci that followed centrosome
localization throughout mitosis, while maintaining diffuse cytoplasmic
labeling. Endogenous variant 2 in HeLa cells showed a similar staining
pattern. Centrosomal localization was independent of microtubules.

Di et al. (2003) identified an Ntkl-binding protein (GORAB; 607983) in
mouse that colocalized with Ntkl in cytoplasm and showed ubiquitous
expression.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kato et al. (2002) determined that the SCYL1 gene contains 18 exons and
spans about 15 kb. Alternative splicing produces variant 1, which lacks
half of exon 14, and variant 2, which lacks most of exon 14, all of exon
15, and half of exon 16.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Liu et al. (2000) and Kato et al. (2002)
mapped the SCYL1 gene to chromosome 11q13.

614531	TITLE *614531 RASGEF DOMAIN FAMILY, MEMBER 1A; RASGEF1A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

RAS proteins (see HRAS; 190020) are small GTPases that are
interconvertible between an active GTP-bound form and an inactive
GDP-bound form. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), such as
RASGEF1A, induce release of GDP, permitting reloading of GTP onto RAS
and activation of cell signaling (Ura et al., 2006).

CLONING

Using microarray analysis to identify genes upregulated in intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma, Ura et al. (2006) identified RASGEF1A. The deduced
protein contains a RASGEF domain and a RAS exchange motif, and it shares
30% and 29% identity with PDZGEF2 (RAPGEF6; 610499) and PDZGEF1
(RAPGEF2; 609530), respectively. Northern blot analysis detected a
transcript of about 3.3 kb that was moderately expressed in brain and
spinal cord and weakly expressed in lymph node and adrenal gland, but
not in any of 19 other tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Ura et al. (2006) found that recombinant RASGEF1A stimulated
radiolabeled GDP dissociation from KRAS (190070), HRAS, and NRAS
(164790). In transfected COS-7 cells, exogenous RASGEF1A activated Ras,
which increased its affinity for Raf1 (164760). Overexpression of
RASGEF1A in COS-7 cells increased cell migration, but it had no effect
on colony-forming ability. Knockdown of RASGEF1A via small interfering
RNA reduced cell growth of COS-7 and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma
cells.

Yaman et al. (2009) presented evidence that RASGEF1A and RASGEF1B
(614532) function as specific GEFs for RAP2 (RAP2A; 179540), but not for
RAP1 (RAP1A; 179520) or other members of the RAS family.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the RASGEF1A gene to chromosome 10q11.21 based on an
alignment of the RASGEF1A sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK095136) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

603805	TITLE *603805 TRANSGLUTAMINASE 5; TGM5
;;TRANSGLUTAMINASE X; TGX
DESCRIPTION Transglutaminases (EC 2.3.2.13) represent a family of enzymes capable of
stabilizing protein assemblies by gamma-glutamyl-epsilon-lysine
crosslinks. For additional background information about
transglutaminases, see TGM1 (190195).

CLONING

By RT-PCR of keratinocyte mRNA with degenerate primers based on the
conserved transglutaminase active-site region, Aeschlimann et al. (1998)
isolated a partial cDNA encoding a novel member of this family, TGM5,
which they designated transglutaminase X (TGX). Using anchored PCR, the
authors cloned additional cDNAs encoding 2 TGX isoforms: a long
720-amino acid form and a short 638-amino acid form. The long form
contains an insert in the N-terminal region. Grenard et al. (2001)
identified the 2 isoforms as products of alternative gene splicing.
Aeschlimann et al. (1998) found that TGM5 contains the conserved
structural requirements for transglutaminase activity and calcium
binding. Overall, TGM5 shares 40%, 42%, 35%, and 31% protein sequence
identity with TGC (TGM2; 190196), TGE (TGM3; 600238), TGK (TGM1;
190195), and TGP (TGM4; 600585), respectively. Northern blot analysis
revealed that TGM5 is expressed as 2.2- and 2.8-kb mRNAs in foreskin
keratinocytes. By Northern dot blot analysis, Grenard et al. (2001)
found ubiquitous expression of TGM5, with highest levels in the female
reproductive system, skeletal muscle, and fetal tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Aeschlimann et al. (1998) found that expression of TGM5 increased
severalfold when keratinocyte cultures were induced to differentiate by
suspension or growth to postconfluency. They suggested that TGM5
contributes to the formation of the cornified cell envelope of
keratinocytes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Grenard et al. (2001) determined that the TGM5 gene contains 13 exons
and spans about 35 kb. They identified a number of potential
transcription factor binding sites in the promoter region but no classic
TATA box.

MAPPING

By FISH, Grenard et al. (2001) mapped the TGM5 gene to chromosome
15q15.2. Using long-range genomic PCR, they found that TGM5 is part of a
tandemly arranged cluster of TGM genes, including EPB42 (177070) and
TGM7 (606776), in a 100-kb region. By radiation hybrid analysis, they
mapped the mouse Tgm5, Tgm7, and Epb42 genes in close proximity in a
region of syntenic homology on chromosome 2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Peeling skin syndrome (270300) is an autosomal recessive disorder
characterized by the continuous shedding of the outer layers of the
epidermis from birth and throughout life. In some families, an acral
form of peeling skin syndrome (609796) has been reported, in which skin
peeling is strictly limited to the dorsa of the hands and the feet;
ultrastructural and histologic analysis showed a level of blistering
high in the epidermis at the stratum granulosum-stratum corneum junction
(Shwayder et al., 1997; Hashimoto et al., 2000). Cassidy et al. (2005)
mapped a gene for acral peeling skin syndrome to 15q15.2 and identified
the same loss-of-function mutation in homozygous state in the TGM5 gene
in 2 unrelated families (603805.0001).

Cassidy et al. (2005) excluded the TGM5 locus in a large, consanguineous
kindred of Middle Eastern origin with more widespread peeling skin and,
in addition, failed to detect TGM5 mutations in 3 small, outbred
families with widespread peeling skin phenotypes. In all these families,
onset was in infancy and the phenotype was similar to the classic,
generalized form of peeling skin syndrome.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PEELING SKIN SYNDROME, ACRAL TYPE
TGM5, GLY113CYS

Cassidy et al. (2005) described a homozygous missense mutation in exon 3
of the TGM5 gene in members of 2 unrelated families, 1 Dutch and 1
Scottish, who suffered from the acral form of peeling skin syndrome
(609796). A gly113-to-cys (G113C) mutation arose from a 337G-to-T
transversion. In fact, 2 homozygous missense mutations were found;
evidence was presented that one was a rare polymorphism and that G113C
was the pathogenic change.

607986	TITLE *607986 S100 CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEIN A14; S100A14
;;BCMP84
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

S100A14 is a member of a subfamily of proteins related by Ca(2+)-binding
motifs to the EF-hand Ca(2+)-binding protein superfamily.

CLONING

By analyzing a human lung cancer cell line subtractive cDNA library,
Pietas et al. (2002) identified and characterized S100A14, which encodes
a deduced 104-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of
11,662 Da. It contains 2 EF-hand Ca(2+)-binding domains, a
myristoylation motif, a glycosylation site, and several potential
protein kinase phosphorylation sites. Pietas et al. (2002) also cloned
the mouse homolog. S100A14 shares 38% amino acid sequence identity with
human S100A13 (601989) and 97% similarity with mouse S100a14. Northern
blot analysis detected expression of an approximately 1.1-kb transcript
at highest levels in colon and at moderate levels in thymus, kidney,
liver, small intestine, and lung. Low expression of an approximately
1.35-kb transcript was detected in heart and no expression was seen in
brain, skeletal muscle, spleen, placenta, and peripheral blood
leukocytes. S100A14 was found to be overexpressed in ovary, breast, and
uterus tumors and underexpressed in kidney, rectum, and colon tumors.
Transfection experiments indicated localization to the cytoplasm,
particularly in the perinuclear region.

Using a proteomics approach to identify genes upregulated in breast
cancer, followed by database analysis and PCR of a breast carcinoma cell
line, Adam et al. (2003) cloned S100A14, which they called BCMP84.
BCMP84 expression in normal tissue was restricted to stratified squamous
epithelium of skin, cervix, and tonsil. Weak staining was seen in normal
breast ductal tissue, but strong immunoreactivity was detected in 10 of
58 (17%) breast cancer tissues. BCMP84 was expressed in the plasma
membrane of transiently transfected breast carcinoma cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Adam et al. (2003) found that BCMP84
interacted with nucleobindin (NUCB1; 601323).

GENE STRUCTURE

Pietas et al. (2002) determined that the S100A14 gene contains 4 exons.
Exon 1 is untranslated.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Pietas et al. (2002) mapped the
S100A14 gene to chromosome 1q21 in a cluster with at least 15 other S100
genes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Chen et al. (2009) identified 4 SNPs in the S100A14 gene that were in
linkage disequilibrium among Han Chinese individuals. One SNP, 461G-A
(dbSNP rs11548103) in the 5-prime untranslated region, was shown to
diminish a binding site for the transcription factor P53 (TP53; 191170),
and was associated with decreased expression of S100A14 in vitro and in
vivo. A study of S100A14 RNA levels in surgically removed normal
esophageal tissues showed that individuals with the 461GG genotype had
significantly higher S100A14 RNA levels compared to those with at least
one 461A allele. A case-control study of 1,021 Han Chinese patients with
squamous cell esophageal carcinoma (133239) and 1,253 control subjects
found a significant association between the 461A allele and increased
susceptibility to esophageal cancer among smokers (odds ratio of 2.01
and 2.10 for the 461GA or 461AA genotypes, respectively, compared to the
461GG genotype). Chen et al. (2009) suggested that S100A14 may function
as a cancer suppressor in the P53 pathway and play a role in esophageal
carcinogenesis.

607698	TITLE *607698 LIGAND-DEPENDENT NUCLEAR RECEPTOR COREPRESSOR; LCOR
;;MBLK1-RELATED PROTEIN 2; MLR2;;
KIAA1795
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

LCOR is a transcriptional corepressor widely expressed in fetal and
adult tissues that is recruited to agonist-bound nuclear receptors
through a single LxxLL motif, also referred to as a nuclear receptor
(NR) box (Fernandes et al., 2003).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2001) cloned LCOR, which they called KIAA1795.
The deduced KIAA1795 protein contains 572 amino acids. RT-PCR followed
by ELISA detected highest expression in liver, testis, and ovary,
followed by kidney and brain. Within brain, highest expression was
detected in amygdala, corpus callosum, and caudate nucleus.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a fetal kidney cDNA library using the
ligand-binding domain of ESR1 (133430) as bait, followed by screening a
prostate cDNA library and searching EST databases, Fernandes et al.
(2003) cloned LCOR. The predicted 433-amino acid LCOR protein has a
calculated molecular mass of approximately 47 kD. It contains an LxxLL
motif, a nuclear localization signal, and a helix-loop-helix domain.
Northern blot analysis detected broad expression of LCOR transcripts at
varying levels in human adult and fetal tissues, with highest expression
in placenta, cerebellum and corpus callosum of brain, adult kidney, and
a number of fetal tissues.

Kunieda et al. (2003) cloned mouse Lcor, which they called Mlr2, based
on its homology with the honeybee transcription factor Mblk1. The
deduced 433-amino acid protein contains a DNA-binding motif and a motif
conserved in Mlr1 (LCORL; 611799). Northern blot analysis detected
expression of Mlr2 in mouse kidney, liver, and heart, with weak
expression in brain and no expression in testis.

GENE FUNCTION

Fernandes et al. (2003) determined that binding of LCOR to ESR1 depends
in part on residues in the coactivator-binding pocket of ESR1 distinct
from those bound by TIF2 (601993). Repression by LCOR could be abolished
by histone deacetylase (HDAC; see 601241) inhibitor trichostatin A in a
receptor-dependent fashion, indicating HDAC-dependent and -independent
modes of action. LCOR bound directly to specific HDACs in vitro and in
vivo. Moreover, LCOR was shown to function by recruiting
C-terminal-binding protein (CTBP; see 602618) corepressors through 2
consensus binding motifs and to colocalize with CTBPs in the nucleus.
Fernandes et al. (2003) concluded that LCOR represents a class of
corepressor that attenuates agonist-activated nuclear receptor signaling
by multiple mechanisms.

Using a reporter gene assay, Kunieda et al. (2003) showed that mouse
Mlr2 bound and activated transcription from the DNA element recognized
by honeybee Mblk1.

GENE STRUCTURE

Fernandes et al. (2003) determined that the LCOR gene contains 7 exons,
including 4 short 5-prime untranslated region exons that contain several
in-frame stop codons.

MAPPING

Nagase et al. (2001) mapped the LCOR gene to chromosome 10 by radiation
hybrid analysis. By genomic sequence analysis, Fernandes et al. (2003)
mapped the LCOR gene to chromosome 10q24.1.

611981	TITLE *611981 MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN S18A; MRPS18A
;;MRPS18-3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mitochondria have their own translation system for production of 13
proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation. MRPS18A is 1 of more
than 70 protein components of mitochondrial ribosomes that are encoded
by the nuclear genome (Kenmochi et al., 2001).

CLONING

By proteolytic digestion of whole bovine 28S subunits, followed by
peptide analysis and EST database analysis, Koc et al. (2001) identified
full-length human MRPS18A, which they called MRPS18-3. The deduced
MRPS18A protein contains 196 amino acids and has a calculated molecular
mass of 22.2 kD. Removal of a predicted 37-amino acid N-terminal
mitochondrial localization signal results in a mature 18.4-kD protein.
Koc et al. (2001) noted that 1 Mrps18 protein is present in E. coli,
whereas other organisms contain several Mrps18 orthologs. Humans have 3
MRPS18 proteins, MRPS18A, MRPS18B (611982), and MRPS18C (611983), that
share homology only in their central regions. Mouse and human MRPS18A
share 80.1% amino acid identity.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis and analysis of an integrated BAC-STS map,
Kenmochi et al. (2001) mapped the MRPS18A gene to chromosome 6p21.3.
