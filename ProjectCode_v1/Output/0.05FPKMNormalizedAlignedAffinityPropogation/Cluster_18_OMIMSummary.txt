609959	TITLE *609959 MYELOID-ASSOCIATED DIFFERENTIATION MARKER; MYADM
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using differential display analysis, Pettersson et al. (2000) identified
mouse myeloid-associated differentiation marker (Myadm) based upon its
varied expression during differentiation of an Il3 (147740)-dependent
myeloid progenitor cell line established from mouse bone marrow. The
deduced protein contains 8 potential transmembrane domains and several
potential phosphorylation sites. Northern blot analysis on hematopoietic
cell lines revealed restricted expression of Myadm to cells belonging to
the myeloid lineage. Expression was also seen in mature granulocytes and
macrophages. Tissue analysis showed high expression of Myadm in lung and
more moderate expression in bone marrow and brain. RT-PCR experiments
demonstrated expression of Myadm in multipotent cells
(c-kit+Sca-1+Lin-), erythroid progenitors, and early lymphoid
progenitors.

By database searching with mouse Myadm as query, Cui et al. (2002)
identified human MYADM and cloned a full-length MYADM sequence from a
human bone marrow cDNA library. The deduced 298-amino acid protein has a
predicted molecular mass of 32 kD. It contains 7 predicted transmembrane
domains and shows sequence homology with the T-cell differentiation
protein MAL (188860) and plasmolipin (PLMP; 600340). MYADM shares 75.8%
overall sequence identity with mouse Myadm, with highest levels of
conservation seen in the predicted transmembrane regions. Northern blot
analysis detected 3.3- and 2.2-kb MYADM transcripts. Expression of the
longer transcript was seen in all tissues tested except thymus;
expression of the shorter transcript was seen in heart, placenta, lung,
pancreas, testis, and peripheral blood leukocytes and was undetectable
in all other tissues. Semiquantitative PCR assays showed that expression
of MYADM was not only significantly higher in peripheral blood
leukocytes than in bone marrow cells, but was also upregulated in NB4
cells (derived from a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia) that
were treated with the differentiation inducer all-trans retinoic acid
(ATRA).

GENE FUNCTION

Using antisense Myadm oligonucleotides, Pettersson et al. (2000) showed
that downregulation of mouse Myadm expression in pluripotent
hematopoietic progenitor cells inhibited colony formation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Cui et al. (2002) determined that the MYADM gene contains 3 exons and
spans 7.1 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Cui et al. (2002) mapped the MYADM gene to
chromosome 19q13.33-q13.4.

A20-BINDING INHIBITOR OF NFKB 1; ABIN1;;
KIAA0113
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen to identify proteins that interact with
the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 Nef protein, Fukushi et al.
(1999) isolated TNIP1, which they designated NAF1, from an activated
leukocyte cDNA library. They obtained full-length NAF1 cDNAs by 5-prime
and 3-prime RACE. Fukushi et al. (1999) identified 2 alternatively
spliced isoforms of NAF1, NAF1-alpha and NAF1-beta, that differ only in
their C-terminal amino acids. NAF1-alpha contains 636 amino acids, and
NAF1-beta contains 640 amino acids. Both isoforms have 4 coiled-coil
domains and a proline-rich C terminus. Northern blot analysis detected a
2.8-kb transcript in all tissues tested, with strong expression in
peripheral blood lymphocytes, spleen, and skeletal muscle, and weak
expression in brain. NAF mRNA was also detected in various human
hematopoietic cell lines.

GENE FUNCTION

Fukushi et al. (1999) determined that the region of NAF1 that interacts
with the HIV-1 Nef protein is located within amino acids 94 to 412.
Overexpression of NAF1 increased cell surface expression of CD4 (186940)
in a reporter cell system, and cotransfection with Nef suppressed
NAF1-induced augmentation of CD4 expression.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen, in vitro pull-down assays, and in vivo
immunoprecipitations, Zhang et al. (2002) determined that NAF1-alpha
interacts directly with ERK2 (176948). EGF (131530) treatment of
NAF1-alpha-transfected human osteosarcoma cells resulted in the
phosphorylation of NAF1-alpha by the EGF/MEK (176872)/ERK2 signal
transduction pathway. Overexpression of NAF1-alpha suppressed ERK2
nuclear translocation following activation and inhibited the
ERK2-dependent transactivation of ELK1 (311040) in a reporter assay.
Zhang et al. (2002) concluded that NAF1 is an attenuator of activated
ERK2 signaling.

GENE STRUCTURE

Fukushi et al. (1999) determined that the NAF1 gene contains 18 exons.
Exon 1 is untranslated.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Fukushi et al. (1999) mapped the NAF1 gene
to chromosome 5q32-q33.1.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using a murine model of allergen-induced asthma, El Bakkouri et al.
(2005) showed that delivery of the nuclear factor kappa-B (NFKB; see
164011) inhibitory protein Abin1 to the lung epithelium resulted in a
significant reduction of allergen-induced eosinophil infiltration into
the lungs. This reduction was associated with an Abin1-induced decrease
in allergen-specific IgE serum levels and a reduction of eotaxin (CCL11;
601156), Il4 (147780), and Il1b (147720) in bronchoalveolar lavage
fluid. El Bakkouri et al. (2005) concluded that NFKB plays a critical
role in the pathogenesis of allergic inflammation and proposed that
inhibiting NFKB could be useful in asthma therapy.

Oshima et al. (2009) showed that mice deficient for Abin1 died during
embryogenesis with fetal liver apoptosis, anemia, and hypoplasia.
Abin1-deficient cells were hypersensitive to tumor necrosis factor (TNF;
191160)-induced programmed cell death, and Tnf deficiency rescued
Abin1-deficient embryos. ABIN1 inhibits caspase-8 (CASP8; 601763)
recruitment to FADD (602457) in TNF-induced signaling complexes,
preventing CASP8 cleavage and programmed cell death. Moreover, ABIN1
directly binds polyubiquitin chains, and this ubiquitin-sensing activity
is required for ABIN1's antiapoptotic activity. Oshima et al. (2009)
concluded that their studies provided insights into how ubiquitination
and ubiquitin-sensing proteins regulate cellular and organismal
survival.

607865	TITLE *607865 SET DOMAIN PROTEIN, BIFURCATED, 2; SETDB2
;;CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA DELETION REGION GENE 8; CLLD8
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Proteins that contain a SET domain, such as SETDB2, modulate gene
expression epigenetically through histone H3 (see 602810) methylation.
SETDB2 is likely a histone H3 methyltransferase, as it contains both the
active site and flanking cysteine residues required for catalytic
activity (Zhang et al., 2003).

CLONING

Mabuchi et al. (2001) assembled a high-resolution physical map spanning
the critical region deleted in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia
(109543) on chromosome 13q14 and identified SETDB2, which they
designated CLLD8. The deduced 719-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of about 82 kD. SETDB2 contains a methyl-CpG-binding
domain, a preSET domain, and a SET domain that is bifurcated by a
218-amino acid insertion. SETDB2 shares 45% identity with SETDB1
(604396). Northern blot analysis detected a 3.3-kb transcript in nearly
all tissues and tumor cell lines examined, with highest expression in
heart, testis, and ovary.

Using a positional cloning approach, Zhang et al. (2003) cloned SETDB2
from a quantitative trait locus on chromosome 13q14 that influences
immunoglobulin E levels and asthma (147050). Northern blot analysis
detected a 4.0-kb transcript in all tissues examined. Higher molecular
mass bands were also detected at lower levels.

- SETDB2/PHF11 Fusion Transcripts

Using primers designed from exons utilized by SETDB2 and PHF11 (607796),
Zhang et al. (2003) amplified PCR products that spanned both and
represented 3 alternatively spliced fusion transcripts. Expression of
each transcript was tissue specific and was detected in nearly all
tissues examined.

GENE STRUCTURE

Mabuchi et al. (2001) determined that the SETDB2 gene contains 15 exons
and spans 49 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Mabuchi et al. (2001) mapped the SETDB2
gene to chromosome 13q14. It is centromeric to and transcribed in the
same direction as the PHF11 gene.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Calprotectin, the heterodimeric protein complex composed of S100A8 and
S100A9 (123886), is a major calcium- and zinc-binding protein in the
cytosol of neutrophils, monocytes, and keratinocytes (Sampson et al.,
2002). Vogl et al. (2007) noted that complexes of S100A8 and S100A9 are
the physiologically relevant forms of these proteins.

CLONING

Wilson et al. (1975) found a serum protein abnormality in both
heterozygotes and homozygotes with cystic fibrosis (CF; 219700).
Immunologic quantitation of the protein, called CF antigen, allowed the
3 genotypes to be distinguished (Manson and Brock, 1980; Bullock et al.,
1982).

Van Heyningen et al. (1985) showed that a protein immunologically
indistinguishable from CF antigen is present at high levels in
granulocytes from normal and CF persons as well as in myeloid leukemia
cells. They studied somatic cell hybrids between a mouse myeloid stem
cell line and human myeloid leukemia cells and found that CFAg was
expressed only when human chromosome 1 was present. The authors were
inclined to think that the accumulated protein was itself the product of
the CF gene and that it was altered so that it could not be processed
normally; thus, the site of the mutation might be a region of a
polypeptide chain that acts as a site for a specific proteolytic
cleavage step.

Dorin et al. (1987) isolated cDNA clones for CFA from a library
constructed with mRNA from chronic myeloid leukemia cells. The complete
nucleotide sequence was obtained from the cDNA clone and by primary
extension of mRNA. The amino acid sequence, as predicted from the
nucleotide sequence, showed significant homology with intestinal and
brain calcium-binding proteins. Dorin et al. (1987) concluded that
abnormal accumulation of such a protein in CF should be investigated,
since there is gathering evidence that the basic defect is in pathways
controlling chloride channel activity (Welsh and Liedtke, 1986; Frizzell
et al., 1986).

Wilkinson et al. (1988) produced monoclonal antibodies specifically
recognizing CFAG. Immunoaffinity purification of CFAG from several
sources showed 2 components: one of molecular weight 11,000 and one of
molecular weight 14,000. Wilkinson et al. (1988) isolated cDNA clones
corresponding to each protein. Since the major source of these proteins
is neutrophil granulocytes, Wilkinson et al. (1988) suggested the names
calgranulin A (CAGA) and B (CAGB; 123886). Both CAGA and CAGB show
homology with the calcium-binding protein S100 (S100A1; 176940).
Wilkinson et al. (1988) used the monoclonal antibodies to study tissue
distribution of the 2 proteins. Strong expression was found in
granulocytes and in a restricted subset of normal stratified squamous
epithelium, including tongue, esophagus, and buccal cells. Lung,
pancreas, and skin, sites where the cystic fibrosis defect is expressed,
were not calgranulin-positive. A number of hyperproliferative neoplastic
or frankly malignant epithelia were found to express the 2 proteins.

GENE FUNCTION

Calprotectin is a protein complex consisting of S100A8 and S100A9.
Corbin et al. (2008) found that neutrophil-derived calprotectin
inhibited growth of Staphylococcus aureus in abscesses through chelation
of Mn(2+) and Zn(2+), an activity that resulted in reprogramming of the
bacterial transcriptome. Abscesses of mice lacking calprotectin had
enhanced levels of metals and increased staphylococcal proliferation.
Corbin et al. (2008) concluded that calprotectin is a critical factor in
the innate immune response to infection and that metal chelation is a
mechanism for inhibiting microbial growth inside abscessed tissue.

Vogl et al. (2007) demonstrated that mice lacking Mrp8-Mrp14 (123886)
complexes are protected from endotoxin-induced lethal shock and
Escherichia coli-induced abdominal sepsis. Both proteins are released
during activation of phagocytes, and Mrp8-Mrp14 complexes amplify the
endotoxin-triggered inflammatory responses of phagocytes. Mrp8 is the
active component that induces intracellular translocation of myeloid
differentiation primary response protein-88 (MYD88; 602170) and
activation of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1 (IRAK1; 300283)
and nuclear factor-kappa-B (NFKB; see 164011), resulting in elevated
expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha; 191160). Using
phagocytes expressing a nonfunctional Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4;
603030), HEK293 cells transfected with TLR4, CD14 (158120), and MD2
(LY96; 605243), and by surface plasmon resonance studies in vitro, Vogl
et al. (2007) demonstrated that MRP8 specifically interacts with the
TLR4-MD2 complex, thus representing an endogenous ligand of TLR4. Vogl
et al. (2007) concluded that MRP8-MRP14 complexes are novel inflammatory
components that amplify phagocyte activation during sepsis upstream of
TNF-alpha-dependent effects.

Using a mouse model of autoimmunity, Loser et al. (2010) showed that
production of the damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecules
Mrp8 and Mrp14 was essential for induction of autoreactive Cd8 (see
186910)-positive T cells and development of systemic autoimmunity. FACS
analysis demonstrated that this effect of Mrp8 and Mrp14 was associated
with Tlr4 signaling and increased Il17 (603149) expression.
Immunohistochemical analysis revealed upregulated MRP8 and MRP14
expression in human cutaneous lupus erythematosus (see 152700) lesions,
and MRP8 and MRP14 were detectable in sera from individuals with active
disease. IL17 was upregulated in CD8-positive T cells from individuals
with lupus when stimulated with MRP8 and MRP14, suggesting that MRP8 and
MRP14 have a key role in the development of autoreactive lymphocytes
during autoimmune disease. Loser et al. (2010) concluded that there is a
link between the local expression of DAMP molecules and systemic
autoimmunity.

MAPPING

Using somatic cell hybrids containing rearranged human chromosomes,
Dorin et al. (1987) localized the CFA gene to 1q12-q22.

Using probes for both subunits of the CF-associated antigen, isolated
from a chronic myeloid leukemia-derived cDNA library, van Heyningen et
al. (1989) and Dorin et al. (1990) confirmed the assignment of CFAG
(CAGA) to 1q12-q21 and showed that CAGB cosegregates with it in a panel
of somatic cell hybrids.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Psoriasis (see 177900) is an inflammatory skin disorder characterized by
keratinocyte hyperproliferation and altered differentiation. Linkage
analyses have identified at least 7 distinct disease susceptibility
regions. PSORS4 (603935) maps to chromosome 1q21, within the epidermal
differentiation complex (EDC; see 152445), a cluster that contains 13
genes encoding S100 calcium-binding proteins. Semprini et al. (2002)
analyzed S100 gene expression in psoriatic individuals from 2 large
pedigrees characterized by linkage studies, 1 linked and 1 unlinked to
the 1q21 locus. The analyses demonstrated that only the 1q21-linked
family had upregulation of S100A8, S100A9, and, to a lesser extent,
S100A7 (600353) and S100A12 (603112). Later studies confirmed
S100A8/S100A9-specific overexpression in 1q-linked pedigrees.

Zenz et al. (2005) showed that inducible epidermal deletion of JunB
(165161) and its functional companion c-Jun (165160) in adult mice leads
within 2 weeks to a phenotype resembling the histologic and molecular
hallmarks of psoriasis, including arthritic lesions. In contrast to the
skin phenotype, the development of arthritic lesions required T and B
cells and signaling through tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (TNFR1;
191190). Prior to the disease onset, the chemotactic proteins S100A8 and
S100A9, which map to the psoriasis susceptibility region PSORS4, were
strongly induced in mutant keratinocytes in vivo and in vitro. Zenz et
al. (2005) proposed that the abrogation of JunB/activator protein-1
(AP1) in keratinocytes triggers chemokine/cytokine expression, which
recruits neutrophils and macrophages to the epidermis, thereby
contributing to the phenotypic changes observed in psoriasis. Thus,
their data supported the hypothesis that epidermal alterations are
sufficient to initiate both skin lesions and arthritis in psoriasis.

Calprotectin, the complex of S100A8 and S100A9, is a major calcium- and
zinc-binding protein in the cytosol of neutrophils, monocytes, and
keratinocytes. Although serum concentrations of calprotectin are raised
in many inflammatory conditions, they are generally lower than 10 mg/L.
Sampson et al. (2002) reported greatly elevated serum concentrations in
5 patients with hyperzincemia and hypercalprotectinemia (194470), a
seemingly novel disorder of zinc metabolism. All 5 patients presented
with recurrent infections, hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, and evidence of
systemic inflammation. Cutaneous inflammation was present in 3, and 3
presented in infancy with severe growth failure. As no structural
defects in the S100A8 or S100A9 subunits of calprotectin were detected,
Sampson et al. (2002) suggested that the hypercalprotectinemia was
caused by a defect in its metabolism.

NOMENCLATURE

Schafer et al. (1995) isolated a YAC from 1q21 on which 9 different
genes coding for S100 calcium-binding proteins could be localized. The
clustered organization of S100 genes allowed introduction of a new
logical nomenclature based on their physical arrangement on the
chromosome with S100A1 being closest to the telomere and S100A9 being
closest to the centromere. In the new nomenclature, CAGA became S100A8.
Schafer et al. (1995) commented that S100A8 had been given 9 different
names by groups who had independently studied the same protein.

606210	TITLE *606210 SELENOPROTEIN N, 1; SEPN1
;;SELN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Selenium deficiency can interfere with normal embryonic development and
fertility or promote the occurrence of certain cancers and viral
diseases. Selenocysteine, the major form of selenium in animals, is
directly involved in the catalytic reaction of selenoproteins.
Selenocysteine is encoded by an in-frame UGA codon. Avoidance of a
translational stop requires the presence of a selenocysteine insertion
sequence (SECIS), a hairpin conserved in the 3-prime untranslated region
(UTR) of all selenoprotein mRNAs. By searching an EST database for
sequences that can adopt a SECIS-like secondary structure, followed by
glutathione peroxidase functional analysis, further database searching,
and 5-prime RACE, Lescure et al. (1999) identified a partial cDNA
encoding SEPN1, which they termed SELN. Sequence analysis detected a
SECIS in the 3-prime UTR of SEPN1. Northern blot analysis revealed
ubiquitous expression of a 4.5-kb SEPN1 transcript, with highest levels
in pancreas, ovary, prostate, and spleen. Hemagglutinin-tagged SEPN1 was
expressed as a 60-kD protein in the presence of a wildtype SECIS element
but not a mutant SECIS element. Lescure et al. (1999) concluded that the
3-prime UTR is a repository of functional RNA motifs instrumental in
posttranscriptional control.

By 5-prime RACE and RT-PCR analysis, Moghadaszadeh et al. (2001)
characterized the full-length SEPN1 cDNA. They found that SEPN1 produces
a 4.5-kb transcript with an open reading frame encoding a 590-amino acid
protein. EST database searches and RT-PCR experiments predicted that
there are 2 isoforms of SEPN1. Isoform 1 corresponds to the full-length
transcript, whereas exon 3 is spliced out in isoform 2. Both transcripts
were detected in skeletal muscle, brain, lung, and placenta, but isoform
2 was always predominant. The exon 3 sequence corresponds to an Alu
cassette and contains a second in-frame selenocysteine codon.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Moghadaszadeh et al. (2001) determined
that the SEPN1 gene contains 13 exons and spans 18.5 kb.

MAPPING

By PAC analysis, Moghadaszadeh et al. (2001) mapped the SEPN1 gene to
1p36-p35, where the locus for rigid spine muscular dystrophy-1 (RSMD1;
602771) maps.

GENE FUNCTION

Using polyclonal antibodies directed against SEPN1 and cDNA constructs
encoding the 2 isoforms, Petit et al. (2003) showed that the main SEPN1
gene product corresponds to a 70-kD protein containing a single
selenocysteine residue. Subcellular fractionation experiments and
endoglycosidase H sensitivity indicated that SEPN1 is a glycoprotein
localized within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Immunofluorescence
analyses confirmed this subcellular localization, and GFP fusion
experiments demonstrated the presence of an ER-addressing and -retention
signal within the N terminus. SEPN1 was present at a high level in
several human fetal tissues and at a lower level in adult tissues,
including skeletal muscle. Its high expression in cultured myoblasts was
also downregulated in differentiating myotubes, suggesting a role for
SEPN1 in early development and in cell proliferation or regeneration.

Jurynec et al. (2008) found that the zebrafish ortholog of Sepn1 was
required for development of the slow muscle fiber lineage.
Downregulation of Sepn1 resulted in disorganized muscle myofibrils and
prominent Z-band anomalies not seen in wildtype muscle. Ryr1a (see RYR1;
180901) and Ryr3 (180903) were also required for formation of
normal-appearing slow muscle cells. Sepn1 stably associated with Ryr
proteins and functioned as a modifier of Ryr calcium flux activity and
redox responsiveness.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The association between selenium deficiency and muscular dystrophy in
livestock suggests a role for selenium in the pathophysiology of
striated muscles. In humans, selenium deficiency is associated with a
cardiomyopathy known as Keshan disease, reported from selenium-deficient
areas of China (Ge et al., 1983). In 10 families with RSMD1,
Moghadaszadeh et al. (2001) identified 2 frameshift, 1 nonsense, and 3
missense mutations in the SEPN1 gene. The nonsense mutation
(606210.0002) identified in a French family transformed the
selenocysteine codon into a stop codon, preventing selenocysteine
incorporation and leading to a shorter protein. The missense mutations
changed residues that are conserved in vertebrates. Two of these mutated
residues were clustered in 1 region, the third being in close proximity
to the selenocysteine residue.

Multiminicore disease is an autosomal recessive congenital myopathy
characterized by the presence of multiple, short core lesions (known as
minicores) in most muscle fibers. On the basis of clinical and
morphologic data, Ferreiro et al. (2002) suspected a relationship
between classic multiminicore disease and RSMD1 due to mutation in the
SEPN1 gene. A genomewide screen, followed by the analysis of 1p36
microsatellite markers in 27 informative families with multiminicore
disease, demonstrated linkage to the RSMD1 locus in 8 families. All
showed axial myopathy with scoliosis and respiratory failure, consistent
with the most severe end of the classic multiminicore disease spectrum;
spinal rigidity was evident in some, but not all, patients. Screening of
SEPN1 in the 8 families that showed linkage and in 14 patients with
classic sporadic disease revealed 9 mutations affecting 17 patients in
12 families; 6 were novel mutations and 3 had been described in patients
with RSMD1. Analysis of 3 deltoid biopsy specimens from patients with
typical RSMD revealed a wide myopathologic variability, ranging from a
dystrophic to a congenital myopathy pattern. A variable proportion of
minicores was found in all samples. The authors concluded that RSMD1 and
the most severe form of classic multiminicore disease are the same
entity.

Clarke et al. (2006) identified a homozygous mutation in the SEPN1 gene
(606210.0008) in patients with congenital fiber-type disproportion
(CFTD; 255310), a congenital muscular dystrophy that has clinical
features similar to those observed in RSMD1.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RIGID SPINE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY 1
SEPN1, GLY273GLU

In affected members of 2 Iranian and 3 Turkish families with rigid spine
muscular dystrophy-1 (602771), Moghadaszadeh et al. (2001) identified a
G-to-A transition at nucleotide 817 of the SEPN1 gene, causing a
gly273-to-glu substitution.

.0002
RIGID SPINE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY 1
SEPN1, SEC462TER

In a French family with rigid spine muscular dystrophy (602771),
Moghadaszadeh et al. (2001) identified a G-to-A transition at nucleotide
1385 of the SEPN1 gene. The mutation changed the selenocysteine (sec)
codon (TGA) into a stop codon (TAA), preventing selenocysteine
incorporation and leading to a shorter protein.

.0003
RIGID SPINE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY 1
SEPN1, MET1VAL

In 3 unrelated families of Italian, Belgian, and German origin with
multiminicore disease (602771), Ferreiro et al. (2002) identified a
homozygous A-to-G transition in the start codon of the SEPN1 gene,
resulting in a met1-to-val (M1V) substitution. In the family from
Germany consanguinity was known. Two children in the family from Italy
were affected.

.0004
RIGID SPINE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY 1
SEPN1, ARG466GLN

In patients with rigid spine muscular dystrophy (602771), Moghadaszadeh
et al. (2001) identified homozygosity for a G-to-A transition at
nucleotide 1397 of the SEPN1 gene, resulting in an arg466-to-gln (R466Q)
substitution.

In patients with multiminicore disease, Ferreiro et al. (2002)
identified the R466Q mutation in compound heterozygous state with a
trp453-to-ser (W453S) substitution resulting from a G-to-C transversion
at nucleotide 1358 (606210.0005). They also identified the R466Q
mutation in a compound heterozygous state with a 1-bp insertion (A) at
nucleotide 713 (606210.0006), resulting in a frameshift.

Jurynec et al. (2008) found that ryanodine receptors (RYRs; see 180901)
in muscle lysates prepared from muscle from a patient with congenital
myopathy and the R466Q mutation showed reduced ryanodine binding
compared with control tissue. Addition of wildtype zebrafish Sepn1
partially restored the binding capacity of diseased muscle lysates and
fully restored the ability of human RYRs from diseased muscle lysates to
respond to changes in the redox potential of the binding environment.

RIGID SPINE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY 1
SEPN1, SEC462GLY

In a Portuguese family in which 2 children had multiminicore disease
(602771), Ferreiro et al. (2002) identified homozygosity for a T-to-G
transversion at nucleotide 1384 in exon 10 of the SEPN1 gene, resulting
in a sec462-to-gly (U462G) substitution.

.0008
RIGID SPINE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY 1
MYOPATHY, CONGENITAL, WITH FIBER-TYPE DISPROPORTION, INCLUDED
SEPN1, GLY315SER

In 2 unrelated families with multiminicore disease (602771) from Belgium
and the U.K. that shared identical RSMD1 haplotypes, suggesting a
founder effect, Ferreiro et al. (2002) identified homozygosity for a
943G-A transition in the SEPN1 gene, resulting in a gly315-to-ser
(G315S) substitution. A German patient with sporadic multiminicore
disease presented the same mutation in the compound heterozygous state
with R466Q (606210.0004).

Venance et al. (2005) identified the homozygous G315S mutation in a
patient with rigid spine muscular dystrophy who presented at age 26
years with cor pulmonale characterized by rapidly progressive
respiratory and right heart failure with cough, orthopnea, and daytime
sleepiness. Two sibs who were heterozygous carriers of the mutation had
mild neck restriction. Venance et al. (2005) emphasized the importance
of early nocturnal ventilatory assistance in these patients.

Clarke et al. (2006) reported 2 sisters, ages 32 and 30, respectively,
with a diagnosis of congenital fiber-type disproportion (CFTD; 255310)
who were homozygous for the G315S substitution. Skeletal muscle biopsies
showed that type 1 fibers were at least 12% smaller than type 2 fibers,
and there was no evidence of multiminicore disease or other findings
typical of RSMD1. Clinically, the women had a severe congenital myopathy
with truncal hypotonia in infancy, progressive scoliosis, progressive
respiratory impairment, and osteopenia. One woman was wheelchair-bound
and had had bilateral hip fractures in her twenties. Three additional
patients from another family with congenital muscular dystrophy were
homozygous for the G315S substitution; however, skeletal muscle biopsy
from 1 of these patients showed only nonspecific myopathy and did not
fulfill the pathologic criteria for CFTD. All 5 patients had abnormal
glucose tolerance tests and showed biochemical abnormalities suggesting
insulin resistance.

.0009
RIGID SPINE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY 1
SEPN1, 92-BP DEL

In 4 affected patients with Mallory-body myopathy (602771) who came from
a genetic isolate in northern Germany (Goebel et al., 1980), Ferreiro et
al. (2004) identified a homozygous 92-bp deletion in the SEPN1 gene
starting 19 bp upstream of exon 1 and including the first 73 bp of exon
1 (del92, -19/+73). The deletion caused loss of the translation starting
codon. The parents were heterozygous for the mutation.

;;FLJ14957;;
KIAA1749
CGNL1/CYP19A1 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned a partial CGNL1 cDNA, which they
designated KIAA1749. RT-PCR followed by ELISA detected high expression
in smooth muscle, spleen, testis, fetal brain, and the amygdala, corpus
callosum, cerebellum, thalamus, and subthalamic nucleus of adult brain.

MAPPING

In a study of cases of estrogen excess due to increased expression of
the aromatase gene (CYP19A1; 107910), Shozu et al. (2003) mapped 3
closely situated genes in 15q21.2-q21.3 in the following order from
telomere to centromere: CGNL1, which they called FLJ14957, TMOD3
(605112), and aromatase (CYP19A1; 107910). By genome database analysis,
Shozu et al. (2003) found that CGNL1 and TMOD3 are transcribed from the
same DNA strand toward the telomere, whereas the aromatase gene is
transcribed from the opposite strand toward the centromere.

GENE STRUCTURE

Shozu et al. (2003) determined that the regulatory regions upstream of
the CGNL1 and TMOD3 promoters are similar. Each has typical
characteristics of a TATA-less promoter, which includes a transcription
initiator cap sequence and multiple DNA motifs that bind transcription
factors.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a father and son with severe gynecomastia of prepubertal onset
(139300) and mild hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, Shozu et al. (2003)
found that an inversion in the 15q21.2-q21.3 region brought the CGNL1
promoter into a position close to the CYP19A1 coding region, resulting
in a cryptic aromatase promoter containing a portion of the CGNL1
promoter and causing a syndrome of estrogen excess (see 107910.0010).

238310	TITLE *238310 AMINOMETHYLTRANSFERASE; AMT
;;GLYCINE CLEAVAGE SYSTEM T PROTEIN; GCST
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The enzyme system for cleavage of glycine (glycine cleavage system; EC
2.1.2.10), which is confined to the mitochondria, is composed of 4
protein components: P protein (a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent glycine
decarboxylase; GLDC, 238300), H protein (a lipoic acid-containing
protein; GCSH, 238330), T protein (a tetrahydrofolate-requiring enzyme),
and L protein (a lipoamide dehydrogenase; DLD, 238331).

Mutations in the T, P, and H proteins have been found to cause glycine
encephalopathy (GCE; 605899).

CLONING

The T protein of the glycine cleavage system is also known as
aminomethyltransferase (AMT). Nanao et al. (1994) isolated the AMT gene
from a human placenta cosmid library. They found that the gene is about
6 kb long and contains 9 exons. They identified 2 putative
glucocorticoid-responsive elements and a putative thyroid
hormone-responsive element. By dot-blot analysis, Kure et al. (2001)
detected expression of AMT in all tissues tested except stomach and bone
marrow.

GENE FUNCTION

Sakata et al. (2001) reported the structure and expression of the
glycine cleavage system in rat central nervous system.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Nanao et al. (1994) assigned the
AMT gene to 3p21.2-p21.1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In patients with glycine encephalopathy, Nanao et al. (1994) identified
mutations in the AMT gene (238310.0001-238310.0002).

Toone et al. (2000) studied 14 unrelated patients with glycine
encephalopathy and identified mutations in 4 cases. In 2 patients,
mutations were identified in the T protein: 1 patient was homozygous for
an arg320-to-his mutation (R320H; 238310.0006), and the other patient
was heterozygous for a novel glutamine-to-termination substitution at
codon 192 (238310.0007).

Applegarth and Toone (2001) reviewed the laboratory diagnosis of glycine
encephalopathy and confirmed 9 mutations in the T protein and 8
mutations in the P protein. They also reviewed the 7 cases of transient
NKH known at that time.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, GLY269ASP

Nanao et al. (1994) found that a patient with typical glycine
encephalopathy (605899) was homozygous for a missense mutation in the
AMT gene, a G-to-A transition leading to a gly-to-asp substitution at
amino acid 269 (G269D).

.0002
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, GLY47ARG

In 2 sisters with atypical glycine encephalopathy (605899), Nanao et al.
(1994) found compound heterozygosity for 2 missense mutations in the T
protein gene: a G-to-A transition leading to a gly-to-arg substitution
at amino acid 47 (G47R) in 1 allele, and a G-to-A transition leading to
an arg-to-his substitution at amino acid 320 (R320H; 238310.0006) in the
other allele. Nanao et al. (1994) pointed out that gly269, which was
mutant in the typically severe case they studied (see 238300.0001), is
conserved in T proteins of various species, even in E. coli, whereas
gly47 and arg320, which were mutant in the atypical and milder cases,
are replaced by ala and leu, respectively, in E. coli. Thus, mutation
occurring in more conservative amino acid residues results in more
deleterious damage to the T protein and a more severe clinical
phenotype.

.0003
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, HIS42ARG

Kure et al. (1998) reported a large Israeli-Arab kindred with glycine
encephalopathy (605899). Enzymatic analysis demonstrated that T-protein
activity was deficient in the liver from 1 affected person in the
family. Mutation detection revealed a missense mutation in exon 2
resulting in an amino acid substitution from histidine to arginine at
position 42 (his42 to arg). Homozygosity for the H42R mutation was seen
in all affected members of the family.

.0004
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, 1-BP DEL, 183C

In a Japanese patient with glycine encephalopathy (605899), Kure et al.
(1998) described a 1-bp deletion (183delC) and a missense mutation,
asp276 to his (238310.0005).

.0005
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, ASP276HIS

In a Japanese patient with glycine encephalopathy (605899) of neonatal
onset, Kure et al. (1998) found a G-to-C substitution at position 955 in
exon 7, resulting in an amino acid change from aspartate to histidine at
position 276.

.0006
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, ARG320HIS

See 238310.0001 and Nanao et al. (1994).

Toone et al. (2001) screened a DNA bank from 50 patients with
enzymatically confirmed NKH and identified the arg320-to-his (R320H)
mutation in 7% of alleles.

.0007
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, GLN192TER

In a patient with neonatal-onset NKH (605899), Toone et al. (2000)
identified a C-to-T transition resulting in a glutamine-to-termination
codon substitution at residue 192 (Q192X). The other mutation in this
patient was not identified.

.0008
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, IVS7, G-A, -1

Toone et al. (2001) reported a novel splice site mutation at the -1
position of intron 7 of the AMT gene: G was converted to A. This
mutation was found in 3 unrelated families and was not found in any
normal controls.

610243	TITLE *610243 ZINC FINGER FYVE DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 27; ZFYVE27
;;PROTRUDIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Mannan et al. (2006) identified ZFYVE27 as a potential spastin
(604277)-interacting protein in a yeast 2-hybrid assay. They described 4
splice variants of ZFYVE27. Transient transfection of HeLa cells with
epitope-tagged ZFYVE27 constructs revealed that ZFYVE27 is predominantly
expressed in punctate vesicles, although a tubular pattern of expression
was observed in a small proportion of cells. Colocalization studies
detected overlapping expression with the endosomal marker EEA1 (605070)
and the endoplasmic reticulum marker RTN1 (600865).
Coimmunoprecipitation studies in NIH3T3 cells determined that spastin
mediates interaction with ZFYVE27 through its N-terminal domain, which
consists of an MIT (microtubule-interacting and trafficking) motif. An
immunoprecipitation assay confirmed the interaction of endogenous
spastin with ZFYVE27.

GENE STRUCTURE

Mannan et al. (2006) determined that the ZFYVE27 gene consists of 13
exons.

MAPPING

Mannan et al. (2006) noted that the ZFYVE27 gene maps to chromosome
10q24.2.

GENE FUNCTION

Shirane and Nakayama (2006) identified protrudin as a mammalian protein
that promoted neurite formation through interaction with the guanosine
diphosphate (GDP)-bound form of Rab11 (see 605570). Phosphorylation of
protrudin by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK; 600997) in
response to nerve growth factor (NGFB; 162030) promoted protrudin
association with Rab11-GDP. Downregulation of protrudin by RNA
interference induced membrane extension in all directions and inhibited
neurite formation. Thus, Shirane and Nakayama (2006) concluded that
protrudin regulates Rab11-dependent membrane recycling to promote the
directional membrane trafficking required for neurite formation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a 5-generation German family with hereditary spastic paraplegia
(SPG33; 610244), Mannan et al. (2006) detected a missense mutation in
the ZFYVE27 gene (610243.0001) that segregated with the clinical
phenotype in affected individuals. Mannan et al. (2006) postulated that
this mutation affects neuronal intracellular trafficking in the cortical
spinal tract, which is consistent with the pathology of hereditary
spastic paraplegia. Mannan et al. (2006) excluded the ZFYVE27 gene from
both the SPG9 (601162) and the SPG27 (609041) loci.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 33, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
ZFYVE27, GLY191VAL

In affected members of a 5-generation German family with hereditary
spastic paraplegia (SPG33; 610244), Mannan et al. (2006) found a G-to-T
transversion at position 572 in exon 6 of the ZFYVE27 cDNA. The mutation
produced a gly191-to-val (G191V) substitution. The G191V mutation (G105V
in isoform c of the protein) is located near the third transmembrane
motif and shifts the transmembrane motif forward by 3 amino acids.
Mannan et al. (2006) observed that expression of the mutated protein
showed an aberrant intracellular pattern in tubular structures and that
its interaction with spastin was severely affected.

Martignoni et al. (2008) commented that they found no difference in the
ability of wildtype or G191V-mutant protrudin to extend neurites in
cellular functional expression studies. The G191V-mutant protein was
also found to interact with Rab11-GDP (605570) and spastin (604277),
indicating that the mutation did not lead to loss of function.
Martignoni et al. (2008) stated that G191V (dbSNP rs35077384) had been
identified as a SNP in several populations, with an allele frequency
ranging from 0.008 to 0.067, thus casting doubt on the pathogenicity of
this mutation. Mannan (2008) replied that their studies showed a
decreased interaction between G191V-mutant protrudin and spastin and
explained that discrepancies could be due to the different assays used
or the variable effect of G191V-mutant protrudin in different ethnic
populations.

606884	TITLE *606884 RNA-BINDING MOTIF PROTEIN 5; RBM5
;;LUCA15;;
G15
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Timmer et al. (1999) identified a YAC clone corresponding to chromosome
3p21.3 that is deleted in the small cell lung cancer cell line GLC20.
They isolated and cloned RBM5 by direct hybridization of this YAC clone
to a pre-B-cell cDNA library. The deduced 815-amino acid protein
contains 2 RNA-binding motifs, a C2C2-type zinc finger motif, a
C2H2-type zinc finger motif, and a bipartite nuclear signal. The same
functional motifs are found in RBM6 (606886), as has also been reported
by Gure et al. (1998), and the 2 proteins share 30% amino acid identity.
Northern blot analysis of multiple tissues detected expression of 7.4-
and 3.5-kb transcripts in all tissues investigated. Although the RBM5
gene is located in a region considered critical for the development of
lung cancer, Northern and Southern analyses of a number of lung cancer
cell lines revealed no patterns of aberrant RBM5 expression.

By physical cloning methodologies and bioinformatic computational
analyses, Lerman and Minna (2000) identified a number of genes,
including RBM5, which they called G15, in a region of chromosome 3p21.3
that is associated with a putative lung cancer tumor suppressor gene.
The mouse ortholog is 97% identical on the protein level. Northern blot
analysis detected wide expression in normal and lung cancer tissues and
cell lines.

GENE FUNCTION

Drabkin et al. (1999) found that recombinant proteins containing the RNA
recognition motifs of RBM5 or RBM6 specifically bind poly(G) RNA
homopolymers in vitro.

Lerman and Minna (2000) identified no mutations in the RBM5 gene in lung
cancer cell lines. They concluded that RBM5 is an unlikely candidate as
a tumor suppressor gene.

Oh et al. (2002) found that the RBM5 gene, which they called H37, showed
reduced expression in 9 of 11 primary nonsmall cell lung cancers when
compared with adjacent normal bronchial cells. Introduction of H37 cDNA
into human breast cancer cells with deletion of 3p22-p21 reduced both
anchorage-dependent and -independent cell growth in vitro. They
concluded that H37 may have a role as a tumor suppressor gene in human
lung cancer.

GENE STRUCTURE

Timmer et al. (1999) determined that the RBM5 gene contains 25 exons. By
genomic sequence analysis, Lerman and Minna (2000) detected only 18
exons in the 18.5-kb RBM5 gene.

MAPPING

Timmer et al. (1999) identified the RBM5 gene within a YAC clone
corresponding to chromosome 3p21.3.

614612	TITLE *614612 KN MOTIF- AND ANKYRIN REPEAT DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 4; KANK4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the KANK family, such as KANK4, contain a KANK N-terminal
(KN) motif, at least 1 coiled-coil domain, and an ankyrin (see 612641)
repeat domain. KANK proteins appear to regulate formation of actin
stress fibers (Zhu et al., 2008).

CLONING

By database analysis, Zhu et al. (2008) identified human KANK2 (614610),
KANK3 (614611), and KANK4. They identified orthologs of all 3 KANK genes
in rat and mouse and at least 1 KANK ortholog in chicken, fish, sea
urchin, fly, and nematode. The deduced 995-amino acid human KANK4
protein contains a KN motif, followed by a coiled-coil motif and 5
C-terminal ankyrin repeats. The KN motif contains leucine- and
arginine-rich regions and potential nuclear localization and export
signals. RT-PCR detected KANK4 expression in all tissues examined, with
highest expression in colon, kidney, liver, lung, and skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhu et al. (2008) found that overexpression of human KANK2, KANK3, or
KANK4 in mouse fibroblasts reduced formation of actin stress fibers.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the KANK4 gene to chromosome 1p31.3 based on an
alignment of the KANK4 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC041418) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;HISTONE ACETYLTRANSFERASE MYST4; MYST4;;
MONOCYTIC LEUKEMIA ZINC FINGER PROTEIN-RELATED FACTOR; MORF
MORF/CBF FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Champagne et al. (1999) identified and characterized monocytic leukemia
zinc finger protein-related factor (MORF), a novel human histone
acetyltransferase. MORF is a 1,781-residue protein that is ubiquitously
expressed in adult human tissues. MORF also contains a strong
transcriptional repression domain at its N terminus and a highly potent
activation domain at its C terminus, and may be involved in both
positive and negative regulation of transcription.

Using immunohistochemistry on mice of various developmental ages,
Campeau et al. (2012) demonstrated expression of Myst4 in the
telencephalic vesicles, trigeminal ganglion, spinal cord, dorsal root
ganglia, digestive tract, pancreas, liver, and ribs of developing
embryo; after birth, it is strongly expressed in the diaphysis of the
long bones, the kidney, and the patella, among other organs.

- MORF/CBP Fusion Gene

Panagopoulos et al. (2001) reported a novel t(10;16)(q22;p13)
chromosomal translocation in a childhood acute myelogenous leukemia
(AML-M5a) leading to a MORF-CBP (600140) chimera. RT-PCR experiments
yielded in-frame MORF-CBP and CBP-MORF fusion transcripts. Genomic
analyses revealed that the breaks were close to Alu elements in intron
16 of MORF and intron 2 of CBP and that duplications had occurred near
the breakpoints. The authors constructed an exon/intron map of the MORF
gene. The MORF-CBP protein retained the zinc fingers, 2 nuclear
localization signals, the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain, a
portion of the acidic domain of MORF, and the CBP protein downstream of
codon 29. The part of CBP encoding the RARA-binding domain, the
CREB-binding domain, the 3 cys/his-rich regions, the bromodomain, the
HAT domain and the glu-rich domains was present. In the reciprocal
CBP-MORF, part of the acidic domain, and the C-terminal ser- and
met-rich regions of MORF may be driven by the CBP promoter.

MAPPING

Champagne et al. (1999) mapped the MORF gene to chromosome 10q22 by
FISH.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Clayton-Smith et al. (2011) studied a cohort of 19 individuals with a
presumed diagnosis of the Ohdo syndrome SBBYS variant (SBBYSS; 603736).
Twelve individuals were considered to have typical features of the
syndrome, 2 had suggestive but milder features, and 5 were classified as
atypical. By whole-exome sequencing in 4 individuals with typical
features, Clayton-Smith et al. (2011) identified heterozygous mutations
in the KAT6B gene: a nonsense mutation (E1357X; 605880.0004) in
individual 4, a 1-bp insertion (605880.0001) in individual 1, and a 2-bp
deletion (605880.0002) in individual 2. Subsequently, all 19 individuals
with an SBBYSS or an SBBYSS-like phenotype were sequenced for the entire
KAT6B coding region by classic Sanger sequencing. Truncating mutations
in exon 18 of the KAT6B gene were confirmed in 12 individuals, and
individual 3 was found to have a heterozygous frameshift mutation in
exon 15 (605880.0003), which had not been detected on whole-exome
sequencing. When parental samples were available, the mutations were
shown to have occurred de novo. Clayton-Smith et al. (2011) suggested
that mutations of protein-protein interaction domains in exon 18 result
in a more complex phenotype than the phenotype due to simple
haploinsufficiency of KAT6B and raised the possibility that exon 18
mutations are activating or have a dominant-negative effect.

In 6 patients with genitopatellar syndrome (GTPTS; 606170), Campeau et
al. (2012) identified 5 different heterozygous de novo truncating
mutations in exon 18 of the KAT6B gene (605880.0005-605880.0009), all of
which were predicted to result in loss of the highly conserved
transcription activation domain. Campeau et al. (2012) noted that
SBBYSS, also caused by mutation in KAT6B, is a disorder with features
overlapping those of genitopatellar syndrome, but with clinical
differences.

Simpson et al. (2012) identified mutations in the KAT6B gene in 5
unrelated patients with genitopatellar syndrome (see, e.g., 605880.0006
and 605880.0010); they stated that the form of Ohdo syndrome (SBBYSS) in
which mutations in KAT6B had been found is phenotypically distinct from
genitopatellar syndrome.

In 2 children with clinical features of SBBYSS, including a 4-year-old
girl previously reported by Szakszon et al. (2011), Szakszon et al.
(2013) identified different de novo truncating mutations in the distal
region of exon 18 of the KAT6B gene (605880.0011-605880.0012).

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Szakszon et al. (2013) noted that truncating mutations of KAT6B exon 18
between positions c.3018 and c.3892 had been shown to cause GTPTS,
whereas truncating mutations distal to position c.4069 in the same exon
cause SBBYSS (with one exception, a c.4360_4368delins mutation in a
patient with GTPTS; see 605880.0005). They stated that their finding of
truncating mutations of KAT6B exon 18 at positions c.5064_5071
(605880.0011) and c.5389 (605880.0012) in patients with SBBYSS confirmed
this genotype-phenotype correlation.

ANIMAL MODEL

Clayton-Smith et al. (2011) examined mice carrying a gene trap insertion
in the mouse ortholog Kat6b (Qkf/Myst4/Morf) that produces approximately
5% of the normal amount of Kat6b mRNA. The Qkf gt/gt hypomorphic mutant
displayed a number of defects that mirror SBBYSS syndrome, although the
phenotype in the mice is milder. Mice are of normal size at birth but
fail to thrive and have brain developmental defects as well as
craniofacial defects. Observed abnormalities include short and narrow
palpebral fissures, low set ears, and malocclusion. Qkf mRNA is strongly
expressed in the eyelids and teeth primordia during development. Similar
to individuals with SBBYSS, the Qkf gt/gt mice have long, slender feet
and disproportionately long first digits.

et al. (2012) identified heterozygosity for a de novo deletion/insertion
(4360_4368delinsAAAAACCAAAA) in exon 18 of the KAT6B gene, predicted to
result in premature termination and loss of the highly conserved
transcription activation domain. The mutation was not found in the
patient's unaffected parents or in the Exome Variant Server.

.0006

KAT6B, 4-BP DEL, 3769TCTA

In 2 unrelated male patients with genitopatellar syndrome (606170), 1 of

(2012) identified heterozygosity for a de novo 4-bp deletion
(3769delTCTA) in exon 18 of the KAT6B gene, predicted to result in
premature termination and loss of the highly conserved transcription
activation domain. The mutation was not found in the patients'
unaffected parents or in the Exome Variant Server.

In an unrelated 7-month-old girl and 3-month-old boy with genitopatellar
syndrome (606170), Simpson et al. (2012) identified heterozygosity for
the 3769delTCTA mutation in the KAT6B gene, which was not present in
their unaffected parents, in the 1000 Genomes Project, or in 600 control

originally reported by Abdul-Rahman et al. (2006), Campeau et al. (2012)
identified heterozygosity for a 3892G-T transversion in exon 18 of the
KAT6B gene, predicted to result in premature termination and loss of the
highly conserved transcription activation domain. DNA from the patient's
parents was unavailable; however, the mutation was not found in the
Exome Variant Server.

KAT6B, GLY1268TER

In a female patient with genitopatellar syndrome (606170), originally
reported by Lammer and Abrams (2002), Campeau et al. (2012) identified
heterozygosity for a de novo 3802G-T transversion in exon 18 of the
KAT6B gene, predicted to result in premature termination and loss of the
highly conserved transcription activation domain. The mutation was not
found in the patient's unaffected parents or in the Exome Variant
Server.

KAT6B, 4-BP DEL, NT1227

In a female patient with genitopatellar syndrome (606170), originally
reported by Reardon (2002), Simpson et al. (2012) identified
heterozygosity for a de novo 4-bp deletion (3680_3695del) in exon 18 of
the KAT6B gene. The mutation was not found in her unaffected parents, in
the 1000 Genomes Project, or in 600 control exome profiles.

In a child of Sicilian ancestry with SBBYSS (603736), Szakszon et al.
(2013) identified a heterozygous, de novo, complex insertion/deletion
mutation, c.5064_5071delTACTATGGinsCACA, in exon 18 of the KAT6B gene,
leading to a net loss of 4 bp, a frameshift, and a premature stop codon
(met1690glufs*24).

KAT6B, ARG1797TER

By Sanger sequencing in a patient (individual 13) with typical SBBYSS
(603736), Clayton-Smith et al. (2011) identified a heterozygous de novo
c.5389C-T transition in exon 18 of the KAT6B gene, resulting in an
arg1797-to-ter (R1797X) substitution. The parents did not have the
mutation.

In a child of Hungarian ancestry with typical SBBYSS, previously
reported by Szakszon et al. (2011), Szakszon et al. (2013) identified de

603698	TITLE *603698 GOLGI-SPECIFIC BREFELDIN-A RESISTANCE FACTOR 1; GBF1
DESCRIPTION Members of the Sec7 domain family share a conserved region that forms a
catalytic fold with guanine nucleotide exchange activity. In vitro, the
Sec7 domain of several proteins catalyzes the activation of
ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs; see 103180), suggesting that members of
the Sec7 domain family represent specific guanine nucleotide exchange
factors for the ARF GTPase family. Nagase et al. (1996) isolated
KIAA0248, a partial cDNA from immature myeloid cells encoding a protein
with homology to S. cerevisiae Sec7. Using 5-prime RACE, Mansour et al.
(1998) isolated a cDNA corresponding to the remainder of the coding
sequence. They designated the gene GBF1 (Golgi-specific brefeldin A
resistance factor-1). The predicted 1,859-amino acid protein has a pI of
5.55 and contains a Sec7 domain and a proline-rich C terminus. A 7-kb
GBF1 mRNA was expressed in all tissues tested by Northern blot analysis.

By analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel and by fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Mansour et al. (1998) mapped the GBF1 gene to 10q24.
Another Sec7 domain family member, PSD (602327), maps to the same
region.

610610	TITLE *610610 GINS COMPLEX SUBUNIT 3; GINS3
;;PSF3, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; PSF3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The yeast heterotetrameric GINS complex is made up of Sld5 (GINS4;
610611), Psf1 (GINS1; 610608), Psf2 (GINS2; 610609), and Psf3. The
formation of the GINS complex is essential for the initiation of DNA
replication in yeast and Xenopus egg extracts (Ueno et al., 2005). See
GINS1 for additional information about the GINS complex.

CLONING

By searching a human database for sequences similar to yeast Psf3,
Takayama et al. (2003) identified GINS3, which they called PSF3. The
deduced protein contains 216 amino acids.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the GINS3
gene to chromosome 16 (TMAP RH65173).

NOMENCLATURE

The GINS complex derives its name from the Japanese words Go, Ichi, Nii,
and San, which mean 5, 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and refer to the
numbering of the yeast homologs of the GINS complex (Takayama et al.,
2003).

610005	TITLE *610005 TRAF2- AND NCK-INTERACTING KINASE; TNIK
;;KIAA0551
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Germinal center kinases (GCKs), such as TNIK, are characterized by an
N-terminal kinase domain and a C-terminal GCK domain that serves a
regulatory function (Fu et al., 1999).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned TNIK, which they designated
KIAA0551. The deduced 1,333-amino acid protein has an apparent molecular
mass of more than 100 kD and shares 40.9% amino acid identity with mouse
Nik (MAP3K14; 604655) over 981 amino acids. RT-PCR analysis detected
intermediate expression in brain, weak expression in kidney, testis, and
small intestine, and little to no expression in all other tissues
examined.

Using TRAF2 (601895) and NCK (600508) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen
of brain and T/B-cell cDNA libraries, followed by 5-prime RACE and PCR
of brain, heart, and spleen cDNA, Fu et al. (1999) cloned 8 TNIK splice
variants. The variants differ in their use of 3 exons encoding the
intermediate region between the kinase and GCK domains. The longest
deduced protein contains 1,360 amino acids. Northern blot analysis
detected ubiquitous TNIK expression, with highest levels in heart,
brain, and skeletal muscle. Expression of major 6.5-, 7.5-, and 9.5-kb
TNIK transcripts was tissue specific. PCR showed tissue-specific
expression of the 8 variants in brain, heart, and spleen. Western blot
analysis detected phosphorylated full-length TNIK at an apparent
molecular mass of 150 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Fu et al. (1999) found that TNIK was autophosphorylated in a manner
dependent upon lys54 in the ATP-binding pocket of its kinase domain.
Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that epitope-tagged TNIK
coprecipitated endogenous TRAF2 from human embryonic kidney cells.
Mutation analysis revealed that the intermediate domain was sufficient
for the interaction, although the GCK domain may contribute. The
intermediate domain was also sufficient for interaction with NCK.
Cotransfection of TNIK with JNK2 (MAPK9; 602896) enhanced JNK2 kinase
activity in a dose-dependent manner, and this effect was mediated by the
GCK region of TNIK, but not the kinase domain. TNIK overexpression had
no effect on ERK1 (MAPK3; 601795), p38 (MAPK14; 600289), or NF-kappa-B
(see 164011). Overexpression of TNIK in several cell lines resulted in
cells that rounded up and lost attachment to the culture dish, whereas
overexpression of a TNIK mutant lacking the kinase domain had no effect.
Cell rounding was associated with enhanced distribution of actin in a
detergent-soluble fraction. Wildtype TNIK, but not TNIK lacking the
kinase domain, phosphorylated gelsolin (GSN; 137350) in vitro,
suggesting that TNIK may be involved in cytoskeleton regulation.

Taira et al. (2004) found that rat Tnik induced disruption of F-actin
structures, thereby inhibiting cell spreading. This effect was mediated
by interaction of the C-terminal domain of Tnik with Rap2 (RAP2A;
179540). Tnik interaction with Rap2 was dependent on an intact effector
region and the GTP-bound configuration of Rap2. When coexpressed in
cultured cells, Tnik colocalized with Rap2, and Rap2 potently enhanced
the inhibitory function of Tnik against cell spreading. Rap2 did not
significantly enhance Tnik-induced Jnk activation, but promoted
autophosphorylation and translocation of Tnik to the detergent-insoluble
cytoskeletal fraction. Taira et al. (2004) concluded that TNIK is a
specific effector of RAP2 to regulate actin cytoskeleton.

By affinity chromatography of rat brain synaptosome extracts, Kawabe et
al. (2010) identified Tnik among 15 proteins that interacted with
immobilized Nedd4 (602278), an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Rap2a
coimmunoprecipitated with Nedd4 and Tnik, but only following protein
crosslinking. In vitro ubiquitination experiments revealed that Nedd4
monoubiquitinated Rap2a, but not Tnik or any other Ras (HRAS;
190020)-related small GTPase examined. Tnik was required for Nedd4
ubiquitination of Rap2a, and Rap2a monoubiquitination blocked Rap2a/Tnik
signaling. Nedd4 -/- mouse cortical neurons showed underdeveloped
dendrite extensions and arborizations, and expression of
dominant-negative Rap2a or Tnik mutants rescued dendrite morphology in
Nedd4 -/- embryos. Kawabe et al. (2010) concluded that NEDD4 positively
regulates dendrite extension by blocking RAP2A/TNIK signaling.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the TNIK gene
to chromosome 3.

607781	TITLE *607781 PROGESTIN AND ADIPOQ RECEPTOR FAMILY, MEMBER 5; PAQR5
;;MEMBRANE PROGESTIN RECEPTOR, GAMMA; MPRG
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using homology with the sequence of seatrout membrane progestin
receptor, Zhu et al. (2003) identified ESTs containing MPRG, and they
cloned full-length human, mouse, and pufferfish MPRG cDNAs. The deduced
proteins contain about 330 amino acids, consisting of an extracellular N
terminus, an intracellular C terminus, and 7 transmembrane domains.
Northern blot analysis detected a 5.8-kb transcript expressed at high
levels only in kidney. RNA dot blot analysis detected highest expression
in adult and fetal kidney, colon, lung carcinoma, and HeLa cells, and
showed possible expression in adrenal gland and normal lung.

Tang et al. (2005) stated that the 7-transmembrane domain of the
full-length 330-amino acid PAQR5 protein shares significant similarity
with those of ADIPOR1 (607945) and ADIPOR2 (607946). The mouse ortholog
shares 91% amino acid identity with human PAQR5. RT-PCR detected highest
PAQR5 expression in human lung, colon, and small intestine. Weaker
expression was detected in pancreas, lymph node, kidney, brain, testis,
bladder, skin, and adult bone marrow, and little to none was detected in
adrenal gland, stomach, skeletal muscle, adipose, liver, prostate,
breast, heart, and thymus.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhu et al. (2003) determined that recombinant MPRG, expressed by E.
coli, showed high-affinity progesterone binding. Steroid competition
studies showed specific binding to progesterone and several of its
hydroxylated derivatives, whereas estrogen, androgen, and corticosteroid
had low or no affinity for the receptor. Association and dissociation
kinetics were rapid.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tang et al. (2005) determined that the PAQR5 gene contains 7 coding
exons.

MAPPING

Zhu (2003) stated that the human MPRG gene maps to chromosome 15. By
genomic sequence analysis, Tang et al. (2005) mapped the PAQR5 gene to
chromosome 15q23.

613741	TITLE *613741 GLYCOGEN PHOSPHORYLASE, LIVER; PYGL
;;LGP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Phosphorylases (EC 2.4.1.1), such as PYGL, remove glycosyl units from
the terminal branches of glycogen through phosphorolysis, forming
glucose 1-phosphate. During stress, exercise, hypoxia, and hypoglycemia,
phosphorylase activity is primarily regulated by interconversion of the
active phosphorylated form and the inactive, nonphosphorylated form
(summary by Ercan-Fang et al., 2002).

CLONING

Newgard et al. (1986) reported the cDNA sequence encoding human liver
glycogen phosphorylase. The deduced protein contains 845 amino acids.

Burwinkel et al. (1998) reported corrections in the previously reported
PYGL coding sequence and polymorphisms in that sequence.

GENE STRUCTURE

Burwinkel et al. (1998) reported a partial PYGL gene structure showing
introns in the same positions as in PYGM (608455), which encodes the
muscle isoform of phosphorylase.

MAPPING

By the method of chromosome sorting and spot blotting, Newgard et al.
(1987) assigned the structural gene for hepatic phosphorylase to
chromosome 14. The gene in the mouse maps to chromosome 12 (Glaser et
al., 1989).

Gross (2011) mapped the PYGL gene to chromosome 14q22.1 based on an
alignment of the PYGL sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF046785) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

Using recombinant proteins expressed in insect cells, Ercan-Fang et al.
(2002) measured the effects of small molecular mass molecules on the
phosphorylase activities of the rat and human LGP active forms (LGPa).
When added individually at estimated physiologic concentrations, AMP
stimulated, whereas ADP, ATP, and glucose inhibited, both enzymes.
However, glucose inhibition was about 2-fold more potent with the human
enzyme. UDP-glucose, glucose 6-phosphate, and fructose 1-phosphate were
only minor inhibitors of both enzymes. When all effectors were present
in combination at estimated intracellular concentrations, the net effect
reduced human LGPa activity, but it had little effect on rat Lgpa
activity. This inhibition of human LGPa was glucose dependent.
Ercan-Fang et al. (2002) concluded that glucose may be a major regulator
of human LGPa activity, since glucose concentration changes greatly with
feeding and fasting.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 patients with glycogen storage disease VI (GSD6; 232700), also
known as Hers disease, Burwinkel et al. (1998) identified mutations in
the PYGL gene in homozygous or compound heterozygous state
(613741.0001-613741.0004).

By sequencing genomic DNA in a Mennonite family segregating glycogen
storage disease VI, Chang et al. (1998) identified a homozygous
abnormality of the intron 13 splice donor (613741.0005). This mutation
was estimated to be present on 3% of Mennonite chromosomes.

EVOLUTION

Newgard et al. (1986) compared the human liver phosphorylase cDNA
sequence with the previously determined rabbit muscle phosphorylase
sequence. Despite an amino acid identity of 80%, the 2 cDNAs exhibited a
remarkable divergence in G+C content. In the sequence for muscle
phosphorylase, 86% of the nucleotides at the third codon position are
either deoxyguanosine or deoxycytidine residues whereas in the liver
homolog the figure is only 60%. The liver phosphorylase cDNA appeared to
represent an evolutionary mosaic; the segment encoding the N-terminal 80
amino acids contained more than 90% G+C at the third codon position.
Newgard et al. (1986) proposed that the high G+C content in the
N-terminal region of the liver message indicates that this segment was
spliced onto the liver gene from the muscle gene long after the
divergence of liver and muscle tissues. This appears to be evidence for
exon shuffling as proposed by Gilbert (1978). Newgard et al. (1986)
considered it of interest, however, that organisms such as the
thermophilic bacteria and the protozoan Leischmania, which are exposed
to environmental stresses of high temperature and low pH, respectively,
have high G+C content in their coding sequences, presumably because the
greatest stability of G-C basepairs aids the processes of gene
replication, transcription, and, to a lesser extent, translation.
Possibly skeletal muscle, which undergoes a fall in pH and a rise in
temperature during exercise, represents a similarly stressful
environment that selectively maintains high G+C content in expressed
genes.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE VI
PYGL, IVS14DS, G-A, +1

In a 4.5-year-old boy with glycogen storage disease VI (232700), the son
of first-cousin Israeli-Arab Bedouin parents, Burwinkel et al. (1998)
described a splice site mutation. The patient presented at 2 years of
age with hepatomegaly and growth retardation, but had no clinical
history of fasting hypoglycemia. He was found to be homozygous for an
insertion of 119 nucleotides in codon R589, resulting in a frameshift
and introducing a stop codon after 5 missense codons. Sequencing showed
that the insert was an intron, presumably intron 14, but with a G-to-A
replacement in the GT consensus dinucleotide of the 5-prime splice site.
This splice site mutation thus led to the retention of intron 14 and 2
aberrant splice products employing neighboring GT dinucleotides in exon
14 and in intron 14, respectively, as illegitimate 5-prime splice sites.
Both parents were heterozygous for the mutation.

.0002
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE VI
PYGL, IVS4AS, G-C, -1

In a boy with glycogen storage disease VI (232700), the son of unrelated
and healthy parents of Suriname Hindustani background, Burwinkel et al.
(1998) identified a splice site mutation in the PYGL gene.. The patient
presented at age 2 years with hepatomegaly and severe growth
retardation. Transaminases were intermittently elevated. Marked glycogen
storage in hepatocytes was demonstrated. There was no known parental
consanguinity. The child was found to be heterozygous for a G-to-C
substitution in the AG consensus of the 3-prime splice site of intron 4
of the PYGL gene. Two missense mutations, val221 to ile (V221I) and
asn338 to ser (N338S), were found on the other allele. Burwinkel et al.
(1998) thought that the N338S mutation was probably the second disease
mutation because codon N338 is absolutely conserved in all 3 isoforms of
glycogen phosphorylase and also conserved in plants, yeast, and
bacterial phosphorylases; the same cannot be said for the V221.

gene. The patient presented with hepatomegaly at the age of 1 year. Body
length was at the fiftieth percentile, but weight was at the tenth
percentile. Transaminases, triglycerides, and cholesterol were elevated.

GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE VI
PYGL, IVS13DS, G-A, +1

In affected members of a Mennonite kindred with an autosomal recessive
form of glycogen storage disease (232700), Chang et al. (1998) found
that the consensus GT at the splice donor site of intron 13 was
converted to AT in the PYGL gene. This mutation predicts a PYGL protein
with a deletion of either 3 or 34 amino acids.

167780	TITLE *167780 PANCREATIC POLYPEPTIDE/PANCREATIC ICOSAPEPTIDE; PPY
;;PNP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Pancreatic polypeptide (PPY) was the first identified product of the
dominating endocrine cell type of the duodenal pancreas (Kimmel et al.,
1975; Larsson et al., 1976). This hormone of 36 amino acids seems to be
involved in the regulation of exocrine pancreatic secretion and biliary
tract motility (Schwartz, 1983). PPY may be important in regulation of
food intake; genetically obese laboratory animals have altered PPY
release and in New Zealand obese mice weight gain can be cured by
infusion of PPY. Children with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS; 176270) have
blunted secretion of PPY (Zipf et al., 1981).

CLONING

PPY is synthesized as the N-terminal part of a relatively small
precursor. A second hormone, icosapeptide (with 20 amino acids, as its
designation indicates), is synthesized from the C-terminal region
(Schwartz and Tager, 1981). Boel et al. (1984) isolated a cDNA for the
gene for the precursor by oligodeoxynucleotide screening of a cDNA
library constructed from normal human pancreatic mRNA. They concluded
that a third peptide is made from the PPY precursor.

Takeuchi et al. (1986) isolated human cDNA clones for PPY and NPY from a
pancreatic endocrine tumor and a pheochromocytoma, respectively.

GENE FUNCTION

Plasma PPY is reduced in conditions associated with increased food
intake and elevated in anorexia nervosa. In addition, peripheral
administration of PPY has been shown to decrease food intake in rodents
(Asakawa et al., 1999). These findings suggest that PPY may act as a
circulating factor that regulates food intake. Batterham et al. (2003)
investigated the effect of intravenous infusion of PPY on appetite and
food intake in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover
study in 10 healthy volunteers. Infusion of PPY reduced appetite and
decreased the energy intake at a buffet lunch 2 hours postinfusion by
21.8 +/- 5.7% (P less than 0.01). More importantly, the inhibition of
food intake was sustained, such that energy intake, as assessed by food
diaries, was significantly reduced both the evening of the study and the
following morning. Overall, PPY infusion reduced cumulative 24-hour
energy intake by 25.3 +/- 5.8%. The authors concluded that their data
demonstrated that PPY causes a sustained decrease in both appetite and
food intake.

MAPPING

Pancreatic polypeptide and neuropeptide Y (NPY; 162640) show over 50%
homology of amino acid and nucleotide sequence. To investigate whether
pancreatic polypeptide and NPY may have originated from a common
ancestral gene, Takeuchi et al. (1986) used cDNA clones corresponding to
PPY and NPY to analyze genomic DNA from chromosome assignment panels of
human-mouse somatic cell hybrids. These studies showed nonsynteny, with
PPY on 17p11.1-qter and NPY on 7pter-q22.

In the course of creating a radiation hybrid map of the breast cancer
(BRCA1; 113705) region of 17q, Abel et al. (1993) found that the PPY
gene is located distal to TOP2A (126430), situated at 17q21-q22, and
proximal to GP3A (173470), situated at 17q21.32. By fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Flejter et al. (1993) placed PPY in the same position,
proximal to EPB3 (109270), previously mapped to 17q21-q22, and distal to
TOP2A. Chandrasekharappa et al. (1994) demonstrated that PPY and D17S78
are present within the same cosmid clone and, therefore, no farther than
45 kb apart on 17q21. Hort et al. (1995) showed that PPY and the PYY
gene (600781) are located approximately 10 kb apart on 17q21.1.

605255	TITLE *605255 ETS VARIANT GENE 7; ETV7
;;ETS TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR TEL2; TEL2;;
TELB
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ETS (E26 transformation-specific) family of transcription factors,
of which ETV7 is a member, is a large group of evolutionarily conserved
transcriptional regulators that play an important role in a variety of
cellular processes throughout development and differentiation, and are
involved in oncogenesis as well (Potter et al., 2000).

CLONING

Potter et al. (2000) sequenced cDNA clones corresponding to a novel ETS
gene from an activated T-cell cDNA library, as well as from breast
tissue and meningioma cDNA libraries. The cDNA, which the authors
designated TEL2, encodes a deduced 341-amino acid protein that shares
38% sequence identity with TEL1 (ETV6; 600618). TEL2 contains a
C-terminal ETS domain and an N-terminal PNT domain, which is thought to
mediate protein-protein interactions. Northern blot analysis revealed
expression of TEL2 mRNA predominantly in hematopoietic tissues; a
predominant band of approximately 1.2 kb was present in fetal liver and
bone marrow and was faintly present in peripheral blood leukocytes.
Using antibodies raised against the C terminus of the TEL2 protein,
Potter et al. (2000) showed that TEL2 localizes to the nucleus. The
striking similarities of TEL2 to TEL1, its expression in hematopoietic
tissues, and its ability to associate with TEL1 suggested that TEL2 may
be an important hematopoietic regulatory protein.

Poirel et al. (2000) identified the TELB gene by comparison of the TEL
sequence with genomic sequence databases. Northern blot analysis
detected ubiquitous expression of TELB.

GENE STRUCTURE

Potter et al. (2000) determined that the TEL2 gene contains 8 exons
spanning approximately 21 kb.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization and by inclusion within a PAC
clone, Potter et al. (2000) mapped the TEL2 gene to chromosome 6p21.

Poirel et al. (2000) mapped the TELB gene to 6p21 by genomic sequence
analysis.

600999	TITLE *600999 MYC-ASSOCIATED ZINC FINGER PROTEIN; MAZ
;;ZF87;;
PUR1, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The c-Myc protooncogene (190080) encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein
involved in malignant tumorigenesis. The MYC gene product functions as a
DNA-specific transcription factor. A related polypeptide called MAX
(154950), for MYC-associated factor X, dimerizes with MYC to optimize
DNA binding. A paucity of negative regulatory elements have been
reported for the MYC gene which regulate transcription from 2 initiation
sites specified by the P1 and P2 promoters. ME1a1, a 16-bp nuclear
nuclear factor binding site residing between MYC P1 and P2 transcription
initiation sites, is required for P2 activity. Bossone et al. (1992)
cloned a cDNA encoding a 477-amino acid zinc finger protein, designated
MAZ (MYC-associated zinc finger protein), from a HeLa cell cDNA library
by screening with a concatamerized ME1a1 binding site probe. Its mRNA
was present in all tissues tested (except kidney) as a doublet of
approximately 2.5 to 2.7 kb, along with differentially expressed minor
species. The authors speculated that MAZ may encode a transcription
factor with dual roles in transcription initiation and termination.

Kennedy and Rutter (1992) cloned a full-length cDNA of Pur1 from a mouse
islet cell line. By sequence analysis, they identified MAZ as the human
homolog of mouse Pur1. The deduced hamster, mouse, and human proteins
share approximately 94% sequence identity.

Tsutsui et al. (1996) used Southwestern methods to screen a human
pancreatic islet cell cDNA library for genes encoding proteins that
could bind specifically to the nuclease hypersensitive element of human
c-myc. They identified a gene, named MAZi (for Myc-associated zinc
finger protein of islet), which had a 497-bp open reading frame and was
found to be 99.8% identical to MAZ. The only differences between MAZi
and MAZ were a different 5-prime noncoding region and a shorter
polyalanine tract (11 vs 16 alanines). Thus, MAZi is likely to be a
product of the MAZ gene. However, Tsutsui et al. (1996) reported that
the expression pattern and transcript size of MAZi differed from that of
MAZ. The authors found that a 2.6-kb MAZi transcript was expressed at 5-
to 10-fold higher levels in rat islet carcinoma cells than in normal rat
islet cells and that transfection of islet cells with MAZi resulted in
enhanced expression of a c-myc/reporter construct. The authors suggested
that MAZi may be a positive factor that enhances the expression of c-myc
in islet cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Kennedy and Rutter (1992) identified a transcription factor, which they
referred to as Pur1 because of its ability to bind to purine-rich
sequences, from a hamster insulinoma cell line. Such purine-rich
stretches of nucleotides (GAGA boxes) are often found just upstream of
transcription start sites in many genes, including insulin (INS;
176730). Mutation analysis suggested that the GAGA box plays an
important role in transcription of the rat insulin I gene. Kennedy and
Rutter (1992) found that Pur1 binds to the GAGA boxes of the rat insulin
I and II genes and the human islet amyloid polypeptide gene.
Cotransfection experiments showed that Pur1 is a potent transactivator
in both pancreatic and nonpancreatic cells. Pur1 was also found to
stimulate transcription from the intact rat insulin I promoter in HeLa
cells, where the promoter is normally inactive.

Song et al. (1998) showed that both MAZ protein and mRNA levels are
modulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner.

Gastrin (GAS; 137250) regulates the expression of a variety of genes
involved in the control of acid secretion. It also triggers tissue
response to damage, infection, and inflammation in cells expressing
gastrin receptor (CCKBR; 118445) and, indirectly, in nearby cells via a
paracrine mechanism. Almeida-Vega et al. (2009) found that gastrin
directly induced upregulation of the antiapoptotic regulator PAI2
(SERPINB2; 173390) in CCKBR-positive cells. CCKBR-positive cells also
released IL8 (146930) and prostaglandin E2 into the culture medium in
response to gastrin, which resulted in elevated PAI2 expression in
cocultured CCKBR-negative cells. IL8 signaling in CCKBR-negative cells
upregulated PAI2 via binding of the ASC1 complex (see TRIP4; 604501) to
the PAI2 promoter. Prostaglandin E2 independently upregulated PAI2 via
RHOA (165390)-dependent signaling that induced binding of MAZ to the
PAI2 promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin
immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that MAZ and the p50 subunit of
the ASC1 complex (ASCC1; 614215) bound directly to sites in the PAI2
promoter. Mutation of the putative MAZ site in the PAI2 promoter reduced
responses to RHOA. Knockdown of the p50 or p65 (TRIP4) subunits of the
ASC1 complex via small interfering RNA significantly reduced PAI2
upregulation in response to gastrin.

GENE STRUCTURE

Song et al. (1998) found that the MAZ gene contains 5 exons and spans
approximately 6 kb. The promoter region has features typical of a
housekeeping gene. The authors identified regulatory elements in the
5-prime flanking sequence that are involved in basal transcription and
in the autoregulation of the MAZ gene by the MAZ protein.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Song et al. (1998, 1998) mapped
the MAZ gene to chromosome 16p11.2, within 1.2 kb of the KNLS4 (603213)
gene.

179755	TITLE *179755 PAPILLARY RENAL CELL CARCINOMA TRANSLOCATION-ASSOCIATED GENE; PRCC
PRCC/TFE3 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The PRCC gene is disrupted in a translocation t(X;1)(p11;q21),
frequently found in papillary renal cell carcinoma (Sidhar et al., 1996;
Weterman et al., 1996).

CLONING

Sidhar et al. (1996) demonstrated that the specific chromosomal
translocation t(X;1)(p11.2;q21.2) observed in human papillary renal cell
carcinoma (see RCCX1; 300854) results in the fusion of a gene at 1q21.2,
designated PRCC, to the TFE3 gene (314310) at Xp11.2. To determine
whether the TFE3 transcripts in a tumor cell line were altered at their
5-prime end, 5-prime RACE products were generated from the tumor cell
line. Sequence analysis revealed that these 5-prime RACE products
contained unique sequences. A probe generated from this unique sequence
was used to isolate clones from human fetal and monocyte cDNA libraries.
These clones hybridized to chromosome 1q21.2. Sidhar et al. (1996)
reported that the gene corresponding to the cDNAs encodes a 491-amino
acid polypeptide. The predicted PRCC protein has an N-terminal domain
rich in proline, leucine, and glycine but failed to exhibit homology to
other known proteins.

Independently, Weterman et al. (1996) identified the 2 genes involved in
the t(X;1)(p11;q21) translocation in human papillary renal cell
carcinomas. Weterman et al. (1996) cloned the PRCC gene from a human
cDNA library. They found that PRCC is ubiquitously expressed in normal
adult and fetal tissues.

Weterman et al. (2001) cloned a full-length mouse Prcc cDNA and
determined that the PRCC gene is well conserved throughout evolution.
Like the human gene, mouse Prcc is ubiquitously expressed in fetal and
adult tissues.

- PRCC/TFE3 Fusion Gene

A specific reciprocal translocation between chromosomes X and 1,
t(X;1)(p11.2;q21.2), was described in a case of trabecular papillary
renal adenocarcinoma by de Jong et al. (1986). The same rearrangement
was subsequently found in 4 additional cases of papillary renal tumors
and this translocation may be a characteristic of a specific subset of
papillary RCC (Meloni et al., 1993).

Sidhar et al. (1996) demonstrated the presence of a PRCC-TFE3 hybrid
transcript in 3 papillary renal tumors (see RCCX1; 300854) by RT-PCR
using 5-prime PRCC and 3-prime TFE3 primers. In 2 of the tumors the
breakpoint could be assigned to TFE3 intron 1. Sidhar et al. (1996)
concluded that the PRCC-TFE3 fusion protein apparently represents an
N-terminal transcriptional activation domain adjacent to a TFE3
DNA-binding domain. They noted that a frequent theme for translocations
in sarcomas is the fusion of a transcription factor activation domain to
a transcription factor DNA binding element.

Weterman et al. (1996) demonstrated that through the fusion of the TFE3
gene and PRCC on chromosome 1, reciprocal translocation products are
formed that are expressed in papillary renal cell carcinomas.

MAPPING

The PRCC gene was identified at chromosome 1q21 by translocation
breakpoint mapping (Sidhar et al., 1996, Weterman et al., 1996).

By FISH, Weterman et al. (2001) mapped the Prcc gene to mouse chromosome
3.

604783	TITLE *604783 CLEFT LIP- AND PALATE-ASSOCIATED TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN 1; CLPTM1
DESCRIPTION Yoshiura et al. (1998) identified a family in which cleft lip and palate
(119530) segregated in 2 of 3 generations with a balanced chromosomal
translocation t(2;19)(q11.2;q13.3). They identified a novel gene on
chromosome 19, which they named 'cleft lip- and palate-associated
transmembrane protein-1' (CLPTM1), by positional cloning. Assembled cDNA
sequences and comparison with genomic sequences predicted a gene with 13
exons encoding a putative protein with 7 transmembrane domains highly
conserved between human and C. elegans. Yoshiura et al. (1998) found
ubiquitous expression of a 2.6-kb transcript using Northern blot
analysis of various adult human tissues and whole-mount in situ
hybridization to day 10-12 postconception mouse embryos. Using SSCP
analysis in sporadic cases of clefting and direct sequencing of coding
sequences in familial cases, Yoshiura et al. (1998) identified no
pathologic mutations.

606945	TITLE *606945 LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN RECEPTOR; LDLR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The low density lipoprotein receptor is a cell surface receptor that
plays an important role in cholesterol homeostasis.

CLONING

The low density lipoprotein receptor is synthesized as a 120-kD
glycoprotein precursor that undergoes change to a 160-kD mature
glycoprotein through the covalent addition of a 40-kD protein
(Tolleshaug et al., 1982).

Yamamoto et al. (1984) reported that the human LDL receptor is an
839-amino acid protein rich in cysteine, with multiple copies of the Alu
family of repetitive DNAs. Russell et al. (1984) demonstrated DNA
sequence homology of the LDL receptor with the epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGF; 131530).

Sudhof et al. (1985) found that 13 of the 18 exons of the gene encode
protein sequences that are homologous to sequences in other proteins: 5
encode a sequence similar to one in C9 component of complement (120940);
3 encode a sequence similar to a repeat sequence in the precursor for
EGF and in 3 proteins of the blood clotting system--factor IX (300746),
factor X (613872), and protein C (612283), and 5 other exons encode
nonrepeated sequences that are shared only with the EGF precursor. Since
the LDL receptor is a mosaic protein built up of exons shared with
different proteins, it is a member of several supergene families.
Gilbert (1985) commented on the relevance of these findings to
understanding the significance of 'split genes' and 'exon shuffling'
during evolution.

MAPPING

Francke et al. (1984) assigned the LDL receptor to chromosome 19 on the
basis of expression studies in hamster-human somatic cell hybrids. The
LDLR gene was regionalized to 19p13.1-p13.3 by in situ hybridization
(Lindgren et al., 1985).

Frank et al. (1989) identified RFLPs of the mouse LDL receptor gene and
used them to map the gene, designated Ldlr, to the proximal region of
chromosome 9. Using interspecific backcrosses, they established the
order and interval distances for this and several other loci on mouse
chromosome 9, namely, Apoa4 (107690), which is on chromosome 11 in man,
and mannosephosphate isomerase (154550), which is on chromosome 15 in
man.

GENE FUNCTION

Brown and Goldstein (1974) described LDL binding to cultured fibroblasts
in a manner consistent with a receptor, and found that this binding
resulted in suppression of cholesterol synthesis by the cell via
repression of HMG CoA reductase. In a review article, Brown and
Goldstein (1979) described the mechanism of receptor-mediated
endocytosis using the LDL receptor as the prototypic example, thus
further describing its role in cholesterol metabolism. Normally, LDL is
bound at the cell membrane and taken into the cell ending up in
lysosomes where the protein is degraded and the cholesterol is made
available for repression of microsomal enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl
coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting step in cholesterol
synthesis.

Lo et al. (2007) observed that inhibition of lymphotoxin (see 153440)
and LIGHT (TNFSF14; 604520) signaling with a soluble lymphotoxin B
receptor (LTBR; 600979) decoy protein attenuated the dyslipidemia in LDL
receptor-deficient mice, which lack the ability to control lipid levels
in the blood. The authors concluded that the immune system directly
influences lipid metabolism and that lymphotoxin modulating agents may
represent a novel therapeutic route for the treatment of dyslipidemia.

- LDL Receptor as a Viral Receptor

Hepatitis C virus (HCV), the principal viral cause of chronic hepatitis,
is not readily replicated in cell culture systems, making it difficult
to ascertain information on cell receptors for the virus. However,
several observations from studies on the role of HCV in mixed
cryoglobulinemia provided some insight into HCV entry into cells.
Evidence indicated that HCV and other viruses enter cells through the
mediation of LDL receptors: by the demonstration that endocytosis of
these viruses correlates with LDL receptor activity, by complete
inhibition of detectable endocytosis by anti-LDL receptor antibody, by
inhibition with anti-apolipoprotein E and anti-apolipoprotein B
antibodies, by chemical methods abrogating lipoprotein/LDL receptor
interactions, and by inhibition with the endocytosis inhibitor
phenylarsine oxide. Agnello et al. (1999) provided confirmatory evidence
by the lack of detectable LDL receptor on cells known to be resistant to
infection by one of these viruses, bovine viral diarrheal virus (BVDV).
Endocytosis via the LDL receptor was shown to be mediated by complexing
of the virus to very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) or LDL, but not high
density lipoprotein (HDL). Studies using LDL receptor-deficient cells or
a cytolytic BVDV system indicated that the LDL receptor may be the main
but not exclusive means of cell entry of these viruses.

Atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype (108725) shows close linkage to the
LDLR locus; indeed, the mutation(s) responsible for this phenotype may
reside in the LDLR gene rather than in a separate, closely situated
gene.

Zelcer et al. (2009) demonstrated that the sterol-responsive nuclear
liver X receptor (LXR) (see 600380) helps maintain cholesterol
homeostasis, not only through promotion of cholesterol efflux but also
through suppression of LDL uptake. LXR inhibits the LDLR pathway through
the transcriptional induction of IDOL (MYLIP; 610082), an E3 ubiquitin
ligase that triggers ubiquitination of the LDLR on its cytoplasmic
domain, thereby targeting it for degradation. LXR ligand reduced,
whereas LXR knockout increased, LDLR protein levels in vivo in a
tissue-selective manner. IDOL knockdown in hepatocytes increased LDLR
protein levels and promoted LDL uptake. Conversely, Zelcer et al. (2009)
found that adenovirus-mediated expression of IDOL in mouse liver
promoted LDLR degradation and elevated plasma LDL levels. Zelcer et al.
(2009) concluded that the LXR-IDOL-LDLR axis defines a complementary
pathway to sterol response element-binding proteins for sterol
regulation of cholesterol uptake.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Rudenko et al. (2002) described the crystal structure of the LDL
receptor extracellular domain at endosomal pH. The ligand-binding domain
(modules R2 to R7) folds back as an arc over the epidermal growth factor
precursor homology domain (the modules A, B, beta propeller, and C). The
modules R4 and R5, which are critical for lipoprotein binding, associate
with the beta propeller via their calcium-binding loop. Rudenko et al.
(2002) proposed a mechanism for lipoprotein release in the endosome
whereby the beta propeller functions as an alternate substrate for the
ligand-binding domain, binding in a calcium-dependent way and promoting
lipoprotein release.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Davis et al. (1986) found that substitution of cysteine for tyrosine in
the cytoplasmic domain of LDL receptors impedes their internalization.
Lehrman et al. (1985) found that genes with nonsense and frameshift
mutations that truncated the cytoplasmic domain resulted in
internalization-defective LDL receptors.

In a patient with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH; 143890),
Hobbs et al. (1986) described an LDL receptor mutant in which 1 of the 7
repeating units constituting the ligand binding domain had been deleted.
The deletion arose by homologous recombination by repetitive Alu
sequences in intron 4 and intron 5 of the gene. The deletion removed
exon 5, which normally encodes the sixth repeat of the ligand binding
domain. In the resultant mRNA, exon 4 was found to be spliced to exon 6,
preserving the reading frame. The resulting shortened protein reaches
the cell surface and reacts with antireceptor antibodies but does not
bind LDL. It does, however, bind VLDL, a lipoprotein that contains
apoprotein E as well as apoprotein B-100. The findings in this
instructive case support the hypothesis that the 7 repeated sequences in
the receptor constitute the LDL binding domain, that the sixth repeat is
required for binding of LDL but not of VLDL, and that deletion of a
single repeat can alter the binding specificity of the LDL receptor.

Horsthemke et al. (1987) analyzed DNA from 70 patients in the UK with
heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. In most, the restriction
fragment pattern of the LDLR gene was indistinguishable from the normal;
however, 3 patients were found to have a deletion of about 1 kb in the
central portion of the gene. In 2 patients, the deletion included all or
part of exon 5 (606945.0027); in the third, the deletion included exon 7
(606945.0033). Including a previously described patient with a deletion
in the 3-prime part of the gene, these results indicated that 4 out of
70 patients, or 6%, have deletions.

Langlois et al. (1988) screened 234 unrelated heterozygotes for FH to
detect major rearrangements in the LDLR gene. Total genomic DNA was
analyzed by Southern blot hybridization to probes encompassing exons 1
to 18 of the LDLR gene. Six different mutations were detected and
characterized by use of exon-specific probes and detailed restriction
mapping. The frequency of deletions in the Langlois et al. (1988) study
was 2.5% (6 out of 234 patients). An illustration of previously mapped
deletions and the deletions identified in this study (a total of 16)
suggested that particular areas in the LDLR gene are susceptible to
deletion.

In a Japanese subject with homozygous hypercholesterolemia, Lehrman et
al. (1987) found a 7.8-kb deletion in LDLR (606945.0029). The deletion
joined intron 15 to the middle of exon 18, which encodes the 3-prime
untranslated region, thereby removing all 3-prime splice acceptor sites
distal to intron 15. The mRNA should produce a truncated receptor that
lacks the normal membrane-COOH terminus. The truncated protein was such
that more than 90% of the receptor was secreted from the cell, and the
receptors remaining on the surface showed defective internalization. The
deletion resulted from recombination between 2 repetitive sequences of
the Alu family, one in intron 15 and the other in exon 18. Lehrman et
al. (1987) stated that Alu sequences had been found at the deletion
joints of all 4 gross deletions that had been characterized in LDLR.
Because of these and similar findings in connection with deletions in
the gamma-delta-beta-globin cluster, recombination between Alu sequences
appears to be a frequent cause of deletions in the human genome (see
EVOLUTION).

Horsthemke et al. (1987) suggested that unequal crossing-over between 2
Alu-repetitive DNA sequences was responsible for an intragenic deletion
of the LDLR gene leading to familial hypercholesterolemia. A 4-kb
deletion had occurred between an Alu-repetitive sequence in intron 12
and a sequence in intron 14. The deletion eliminated exons 13 and 14 and
changed the reading frame of the resulting spliced mRNA such that a stop
codon was created in the following exon (606945.0032). The truncated
receptor protein appeared to be rapidly degraded. The deletion was
presumably caused by an unequal crossover event between 2 homologous
chromosomes at meiosis.

Hobbs et al. (1988) found that 16 of 132 cell strains (12%) from persons
with the clinical syndrome of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia
synthesized no immunodetectable LDL receptor protein, indicating the
presence of 2 mutant genes that failed to produce crossreacting material
(CRM-negative mutants). DNA and mRNA from all but one of these
CRM-negative patients were available for study. Haplotype analysis based
on 10 RFLPs suggested that the 30 CRM-negative genes represented by
these 15 individuals had included 13 different mutant alleles. Four of
the alleles produced no mRNA; 3 of these 4 had large deletions ranging
from 6 to 20 kb that eliminated the promoter region of the gene. The
reason for the lack of mRNA in the fourth allele was not apparent. Three
alleles encoded mRNAs of abnormal size. One of the abnormal mRNAs was
produced by a gene harboring a deletion, and another was produced by a
gene with a complex rearrangement. The third abnormal-sized mRNA (3.1 kb
larger than normal) was produced by an allele that had no detectable
alteration as judged by Southern blotting. The other 6 mRNA-positive
alleles appeared normal by Southern blotting and produced normal-sized
mRNA but no receptor protein.

Among 20 mutant LDL receptor genes, Yamakawa et al. (1989) found 4
different deletion mutations (20%). None of these had been reported
previously in Caucasians. Three of them were novel and one was similar
to a previously described Japanese mutation. In 3 of the 4 deletions,
the rearrangements were related to intron 15 in which there are many Alu
sequences.

Rudiger et al. (1991) reviewed previously described deletions in the
LDLR gene in cases of familial hypercholesterolemia and reported the
finding of a deletion in 3 of 25 unrelated patients with FH. Two of
these were equivalent to previously described LDLR alterations, thus
supporting a notion of recombination hotspots which involve Alu
sequences. In at least 4 cases (FH626, PO, JA, and FH-DK3), a deletion
of exon 5 of the LDLR gene has been found as the defect responsible for
FH. The FH626 mutation was characterized by Hobbs et al. (1986) and
found to involve Alu repeat sequences in introns 4 and 5. Rudiger et al.
(1991) characterized FH-DK3 and likewise found involvement of 2 Alu
repeated sequences present in introns 4 and 5. The crossover breakpoints
involve sequences similar to those reported for FH626 but not at
identical positions in the 5-prime end. By use of denaturing gradient
gel electrophoresis (DGGE) in combination with PCR, Top et al. (1992)
found no evidence of a promoter mutation in the LDLR gene in 350
heterozygotes for FH. Hobbs et al. (1992) reviewed 71 mutations in the
LDL receptor gene that had been characterized at the molecular level and
added 79 additional mutations. Furthermore, they reviewed the insight
that all 150 mutations provided into the structure/function relationship
of the receptor protein and the clinical manifestations of FH.

Feussner et al. (1996) described a 20-year-old man with a combination of
heterozygous FH caused by splice mutation (606945.0054) and type III
hyperlipoproteinemia (107741).

Lee et al. (1998) studied 80 unrelated individuals with FH from the West
of Scotland. Microsatellite analysis using D19S394 was informative in 20
of 23 families studied. In these families, there was no inconsistency
with segregation of the FH phenotype with the LDLR locus. Using SSCP,
Lee et al. (1998) also detected mutations in exon 4 of the LDLR gene in
15 of 80 of these individuals; 7 of 15 had the same cys163-to-tyr
mutation (606945.0058). Lee et al. (1998) concluded that microsatellite
analysis using D19S394 is useful in tracking the LDLR gene in families
and could be used in conjunction with LDL cholesterol levels to diagnose
FH, especially in children and young adults, in whom phenotypic
diagnosis can be difficult.

Jensen et al. (1999) studied 17 families with mutations in the LDLR gene
as a model in which to test formally for linkage directly between an
atherogenic genotype and ischemic heart disease or aortocoronary
calcified atherosclerosis. The aortocoronary calcification was
significantly associated with age and plasma cholesterol. Sex,
hypertension, body mass index, and smoking were not associated with the
aortocoronary calcification. Nonparametric analysis indicated
significant linkage of the LDLR locus to aortic (p less than 0.00005)
and to aortocoronary calcified atherosclerosis (p less than 0.00001).
Assuming a dominant mode of inheritance, significant linkage was
detected for aortic (lod = 3.89) and aortocoronary calcified
atherosclerosis (lod = 4.10). Jensen et al. (1999) suggested that the
atherogenicity of variations in other genes could be assessed by a
similar approach.

Yamakawa et al. (1988) described a TaqI polymorphism in the LDLR gene
which should be useful in the study of FH. Leitersdorf et al. (1989)
used 10 different RFLPs to construct 123 differing haplotypes from 20
pedigrees. The 5 most common haplotypes accounted for 67.5% of the
sample. Heterozygosity and polymorphism information content (PIC) for
each site were determined.

Varret et al. (1997) described a database of LDLR genes and provided a
listing of the 210 mutations it contained as of the fall of 1996. Wilson
et al. (1998) described an online database of LDLR mutations.

Kathiresan et al. (2008) studied SNPs in 9 genes in 5,414 subjects from
the cardiovascular cohort of the Malmo Diet and Cancer Study. All 9 SNPs
had been associated with elevated LDL or lowered HDL. One of the SNPs,
dbSNP rs1529729 in the SMARCA4 gene, was highly correlated with variants
in LDLR. Kathiresan et al. (2008) replicated the associations with the 9
SNPs and created a genotype score on the basis of the number of
unfavorable alleles. With increasing genotype scores, the level of LDL
cholesterol increased, whereas the level of HDL cholesterol decreased.
At 10-year follow-up, the genotype score was found to be an independent
risk factor for incident cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction,
ischemic stroke, or death from coronary heart disease); the score did
not improve risk discrimination but modestly improved clinical risk
reclassification for individual subjects beyond standard clinical
factors.

Aulchenko et al. (2009) reported a genomewide association (GWA) study of
loci affecting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and
triglycerides sampled randomly from 16 population-based cohorts and
genotyped using mainly the Illumina HumanHap300-Duo platform. This study
included a total of 17,797 to 22,562 individuals aged 18 to 104 years
from geographic regions spanning from the Nordic countries to Southern
Europe. Aulchenko et al. (2009) established 22 loci associated with
serum lipid levels at a genomewide significance level (P less than 5 x
10(-8)), including 16 loci that were identified by previous GWA studies.
Association of the LDLR gene region identified by dbSNP rs2228671 was
found with total cholesterol levels (P = 9.3 x 10(-24)).

In a patient diagnosed with probable heterozygous FH, Bourbon et al.
(2007) analyzed the LDLR gene and identified a novel variant initially
assumed to be a silent polymorphism (R385R; 606945.0065); however,
analysis of mRNA from the patient's cells showed that the mutation
introduces a new 5-prime acceptor splice site that causes a 31-bp
deletion predicted to result in premature termination. The variant was
subsequently also found in a Chinese homozygous FH patient.

Defesche et al. (2008) analyzed the LDLR gene in 1,350 patients
clinically diagnosed with familial hypercholesterolemia who were
negative for functional DNA variation in the LDLR, APOB (107730), and
PCSK9 (607786) genes. The authors examined the effects of 128 seemingly
neutral exonic and intronic DNA variants and identified the R385R
variant in 2 Chinese families and a G186G (606945.0066) variant that
clearly affected a donor splice site and segregated with
hypercholesterolemia in 35 unrelated Dutch families.

In a metaanalysis of plasma lipid concentrations in greater than 100,000
individuals of European descent, Teslovich et al. (2010) identified SNP
dbSNP rs6511720 near the LDLR gene as having an effect on LDL
cholesterol concentrations with an effect size of -6.99 mg per deciliter
and a P value of 4 x 10(-117). This variant was also found to affect
coronary artery disease risk.

Kulseth et al. (2010) performed RNA analysis in 30 unrelated patients
with clinically defined hypercholesterolemia but without any LDLR
mutations detected by standard DNA analysis; sequencing of RT-PCR
products from an index patient revealed that the major product contained
an insertion of 81 bp from the 5-prime end of intron 14 of LDLR. DNA
sequencing of exons 13 and 14 detected an intronic mutation
(606945.0067) that segregated in heterozygosity with elevated
cholesterol in the proband's family. Kulseth et al. (2010) analyzed an
additional 550 index patients and identified the same splice site
mutation in 3 more probands.

Noting that large-scale genetic cascade screening for familial
hypercholesterolemia showed that 15% of LDLR or APOB mutation carriers
had LDLC levels below the 75th percentile, Huijgen et al. (2010)
proposed 3 criteria for determining pathogenicity of such mutations:
mean LDLC greater than the 75th percentile, higher mean LDLC level in
untreated than in treated carriers, and higher percentage of medication
users in carriers than in noncarriers at screening. Applying these
criteria to 46 mutations found in more than 50 untreated adults, 3 of
the mutations were determined to be nonpathogenic: 1 in LDLR and 2 in
APOB. Nonpathogenicity of the 3 variants was confirmed by segregation
analysis. Huijgen et al. (2010) emphasized that novel sequence changes
in LDLR and APOB should be interpreted with caution before being
incorporated into a cascade screening program.

- Modifiers

Vergopoulos et al. (1997) presented findings suggesting the existence of
a xanthomatosis susceptibility gene in a consanguineous Syrian kindred
containing 6 individuals with homozygous FH (see 602247). Half of the
homozygotes had giant xanthomas, while half did not, even though their
LDL cholesterol concentrations were elevated to similar degrees (more
than 14 mmol/l). Heterozygous FH individuals in this family were also
clearly distinguishable with respect to xanthoma size. By DNA analysis
they identified a hitherto undescribed mutation in the LDLR gene in this
family: a T-to-C transition at nucleotide 1999 in codon 646 of exon 14,
resulting in an arginine for cysteine substitution. Segregation analysis
suggested that a separate susceptibility gene may explain the formation
of giant xanthomas.

In a 13-year-old girl with severe hypercholesterolemia, Ekstrom et al.
(1999) demonstrated compound heterozygosity for a cys240-to-phe mutation
(606945.0059) and a tyr167-to-ter mutation (606945.0045) in the LDLR
gene. Her 2 heterozygous sibs also carried the C240F mutation, but only
one of them was hypercholesterolemic. The authors concluded that there
may be cholesterol-lowering mechanisms that are activated by mutations
in other genes (see 143890).

Knoblauch et al. (2000) studied an Arab family that carried the
tyr807-to-cys substitution (606945.0019). In this family, some
heterozygous persons had normal LDL levels, while some homozygous
individuals had LDL levels similar to those persons with heterozygous
FH. The authors presented evidence for the existence of a
cholesterol-lowering gene on 13q (604595).

Based on the finding from bioinformatic analysis that Alu repeats
represent 85% of LDLR intronic sequences outside exon-intron junctions,
Amsellem et al. (2002) designed a strategy to improve the exploration of
genomic regions in the vicinity of exons in 110 FH subjects from an
admixed population. In the first group of 42 patients found negative for
mutations by former screening strategies, approximately half (22) were
carriers of at least 1 heterozygous mutation. Among a second group of 68
patients recruited to correct for ascertainment bias toward exonic
mutations, 37 (27%) mutation carriers had a splicing regulatory
mutation. Of the 54 mutations identified, 13 were intronic and 18 were
novel, nearly half of which were intronic. Amsellem et al. (2002) stated
that their strategy of detecting the most likely disease-causing LDLR
mutations outside of Alu-rich genomic regions revealed that intronic
mutations may have a greater impact on the molecular basis of FH than
previously reported.

POPULATION GENETICS

Seftel et al. (1980) pointed to a high frequency of hypercholesterolemic
homozygotes in South Africa. In a 7-year period, 34 homozygotes were
seen in one clinic in Johannesburg. All were Afrikaners and most lived
in Transvaal Province. The authors calculated the frequency of
heterozygotes and homozygotes to be 1 in 100 and 1 in 30,000,
respectively. The oldest of their patients was a 46-year-old woman. Of
the 34, six were age 30 or older. The authors concluded that the high
frequency of the gene is attributable to founder effect, as in the case
of porphyria variegata (176200), lipoid proteinosis (247100), and
sclerosteosis (269500). Torrington and Botha (1981) found that 20 of 26
families with FHC (77%) belonged to the Gereformeerde Kerk, whereas
according to the 1970 census only 5% of the Afrikaans-speaking white
population of South Africa belonged to this religious group. Again, the
data were consistent with a founder effect. Using the LDLR activity of
lymphocytes, Steyn et al. (1989) calculated the prevalence of
heterozygous FHC in the permanent residents of a predominantly
Afrikaans-speaking community in South Africa to be 1 in 71--the highest
prevalence reported to date.

Hobbs et al. (1987) found a large deletion (more than 10 kb) in the LDLR
gene in 63% of French Canadians with heterozygous FH. The deletion also
occurred in homozygous form in 4 of 7 French-Canadian homozygotes. The
deletion removed the promoter and first exon of the gene and abolished
the production of mRNA for LDL receptor. The high frequency of the
mutation was interpreted as representing founder effect; 8,000 ancestors
account for present-day French Canadians and there has been relatively
little outbreeding. The deletion has not been observed in any other
ethnic group. It can be detected by analysis of genomic DNA from blood
leukocytes, thus allowing direct diagnosis of FH in most affected French
Canadians. Ma et al. (1989) identified a second 'French Canadian' LDLR
gene deletion which was found in 4 of 80 heterozygotes (5%). The
mutation consisted of a 5-kb deletion removing exons 2 and 3 of the LDLR
gene, which corresponded to the first 2 repeats of the LDLR-binding
domain (606945.0026).

Leitersdorf et al. (1990) analyzed the LDL receptor genes of 11 French
Canadian FH homozygotes. Only 3 different LDLR haplotypes were
identified, and the coding region of the allele associated with each was
sequenced. Three different missense mutations were found. Assays
developed to detect each of these directly were applied to 130 FH
heterozygotes from the greater Montreal area. The common deletion
(606945.0025) responsible for about 60% of cases (Hobbs et al., 1987)
and the smaller deletion (606945.0026) identified by Ma et al. (1989)
and found in about 5% of French Canadians were also sought. They were
able to detect LDL receptor mutations in 76% of the subjects and 14% had
1 of the 3 missense mutations. In the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region of
Quebec province, De Braekeleer (1991) estimated the prevalence of
familial hypercholesterolemia as 1/122, compared to the usually
estimated frequency of 1/500 for European populations.

Like the French Canadians, the South Afrikaners appear to have a unique
form of mutation in the LDLR gene consistent with founder effect (Brink
et al., 1987). Because of the presumed role of founder effect on the
high frequency of familial hypercholesterolemia in South Africa, it is
not surprising that Kotze et al. (1987) found a predominance of 2
haplotypes in 27 informative families with FH. In a study of homozygotes
from the Afrikaner population in South Africa, Leitersdorf et al. (1989)
found that 2 mutations account for more than 95% of the mutant LDL
receptor genes. Both mutations were basepair substitutions that resulted
in a single amino acid change and both could be detected readily with
PCR and restriction analysis. The findings were considered consistent
with the high frequency of FH being due to founder effect. Graadt van
Roggen et al. (1991) studied the prevalence and distribution of the 3
common mutations in South Africa in 27 unrelated homozygous and 79
unrelated heterozygous FH Afrikaner patients from 2 regions of South
Africa, the Transvaal and Cape Provinces. The 3 mutations were FH
Afrikaner-1 (606945.0006), FH Afrikaner-2 (606945.0009), and FH
Afrikaner-3 (606945.0044). The relative distribution of each of the 3
mutations was similar in the 2 regions, with frequencies of 66, 27, and
7%, respectively. Defects other than the 3 common mutations were more
frequent in the Cape than in the Transvaal; thus, the 3 known mutations
accounted for 98% of FH alleles in the Transvaal and only 74% in the
Cape Province. None of the patients carried the familial apolipoprotein
B-100 mutation.

Schuster et al. (1995) identified yet another homozygote for the
val408-to-met mutation (606945.0009), a 12-year-old Greek boy living in
Germany. The mutation was present in both his parents, his brother,
grandmother, uncle, and cousin. The haplotype, using 6 RFLPs of the LDL
receptor gene, was different from the one reported earlier in Afrikaner
and Dutch FH patients. Schuster et al. (1995) concluded that the
mutation in the Greek boy probably occurred independently. Furthermore,
they speculated that, because the parents were from different areas in
Greece, the mutation may be common in Greeks.

Deletion of gly197 (606945.0005) is the most prevalent LDL receptor
mutation causing familial hypercholesterolemia in Ashkenazi Jewish
individuals. Studying index cases from Israel, South Africa, Russia, the
Netherlands, and the United States, Durst et al. (2001) found that all
traced their ancestry to Lithuania. A highly conserved haplotype was
identified in chromosomes carrying this deletion, suggesting a common
founder. When 2 methods were used for analysis of linkage disequilibrium
between flanking polymorphic markers and the disease locus and for the
study of the decay of LD over time, the estimated age of the deletion
was found to be 20 +/- 7 generations, so that the most recent common
ancestor of the mutation-bearing chromosomes would date to the 14th
century. This corresponds with the founding of the Jewish community of
Lithuania (1338 A.D.), as well as with the great demographic expansion
of Ashkenazi Jewish individuals in eastern Europe, which followed this
settlement. Durst et al. (2001) could find no evidence supporting a
selective evolutionary metabolic advantage. Therefore, the founder
effect in a rapidly expanding population from a limited number of
families remains a simple, parsimonious hypothesis explaining the spread
of this mutation in Ashkenazi Jewish individuals.

Defesche and Kastelein (1998) stated that more than 350 different
mutations had been found in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia.
They tabulated the preferential geographic distribution that has been
demonstrated for some of the LDL receptor mutations. For example, in the
West of Scotland about half of the index cases of FH were found to have
the cys163-to-tyr mutation (606945.0058). Defesche and Kastelein (1998)
commented on the geographic associations of LDL receptor mutations
within the Netherlands.

EVOLUTION

Alu sequences are widely scattered in the genome, being present in
300,000 to 500,000 copies. They have been described, for example, in the
genes for alpha-globin (see 141800), gastrin (137250), gamma crystallin
(123660), insulin-like growth factor II (147470), and soluble thymidine
kinase. Each is about 300 bp long; thus Alu sequences represent about 3%
of the total DNA. On the basis of structural similarity, the origin of
Alu elements can be traced to the gene for 7SL RNA (Ullu and Tschudi,
1984). The abundant cytoplasmic 7SL RNA functions in protein secretion
as a component of the signal-recognition particle. This particle,
consisting of 6 different polypeptides and 1 molecule of 7SL RNA,
mediates the translocation of secretory proteins across the cytoplasmic
reticulum. Although the 7SL RNA has a well-defined biologic function,
that of the related Alu repeat remains unknown. Thus, the 7SL RNA gene
may be a progenitor of a processed pseudogene, the Alu element, that has
'recently' spread to different locations in the human genome. The
average Alu family member probably integrated into its present genomic
location about 15-30 Myr ago. The Alu family is specific to primates,
suggesting that these repeats were not present as little as 65 Myr ago.

According to the Alu family copy number, one would, on the average,
expect to find 1 such repeat every 3 to 5 kb in the human genome if they
are randomly distributed. However, studies of the
albumin/alpha-fetoprotein family by Ruffner et al. (1987) and of the
thymidine kinase (188300) and beta-tubulin (191130) genes by Slagel et
al. (1987) indicate clustering of Alu repeats in some parts of the
genome. For example, the beta-tubulin gene has 10 of these repeats in
less than 5 kb of a single intron and the thymidine kinase has 13
members within its introns in a region of about 10 kb.

HISTORY

Some early studies of somatic hybrid cells suggested that the gene(s)
for low density lipoprotein receptor may be on chromosome 5 or 21 or
both (Maartmann-Moe et al., 1982).

Li et al. (1988) worked out a PCR method for analyzing DNA sequences in
individual diploid cells and human sperm. They showed that 2 genetic
loci could be coamplified from a single sperm, and proposed its use for
genetic linkage studies. They analyzed the genotype of single sperm
derived from an individual heterozygous at the LDLR locus and the
HLA-DQ(alpha) locus and could show independent assortment. Individual
sperm were drawn into a fine plastic needle under microscopic
observation and delivered to a tube for lysis and amplification. Eighty
individual sperm were analyzed for the study of independent assortment
of LDLR and DQA. The method has great promise for fine mapping. Boehnke
et al. (1989) described the experimental design and issues of sample
size to be considered in the application of the method to the generation
of fine-structure human genetic maps.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using Ldlr -/- mice expressing the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus
(LCMV) glycoprotein (GP) transgene under control of the insulin
promoter, which functions as a mouse model in which type 1 diabetes
(125853) can be induced at will, Johansson et al. (2008) administered a
high-fat diet for 16 weeks to induce the development of advanced
atherosclerotic lesions before inducing diabetes. After the onset of
diabetes, there was increased intraplaque hemorrhage and plaque
disruption, regardless of lesion size, in mice fed low- or high-fat
diets for an additional 14 weeks. Furthermore, diabetes resulted in
increased accumulation of monocytic cells positive for S100A9 (123886),
a proinflammatory biomarker for cardiovascular events, and for a
macrophage marker protein, without increasing lesion macrophage content,
and S100A9 immunoreactivity correlated with intraplaque hemorrhage.
Hyperglycemia was not sufficient to induce plaque disruption: aggressive
lipid lowering, primarily of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, prevented
both plaque disruption and the increased S100A9 in diabetic
atherosclerotic lesions. Conversely, oleate promoted macrophage
differentiation into an S100A9-positive population in vitro, thereby
mimicking the effects of diabetes. Johansson et al. (2008) concluded
that diabetes increases plaque disruption independently of effects on
plaque initiation, through a mechanism that requires triglyceride-rich
lipoproteins and is associated with an increased accumulation of
S100A9-positive monocytic cells, and that this represents an important
link between diabetes, plaque disruption, and the innate immune system.

Lewis et al. (2009) generated mice lacking C1qa (120550) and/or serum
IgM (147020) as well as Ldlr and studied them on both low- and high-fat
semisynthetic diets. On both diets, serum IgM/Ldlr -/- mice developed
substantially larger and more complex en face and aortic root
atherosclerotic lesions, with accelerated cholesterol crystal formation
and increased smooth muscle content in aortic root lesions. TUNEL
analysis revealed increased apoptosis in both C1qa/Ldlr -/- and serum
IgM/Ldlr -/- mice. Overall lesions were larger in mice lacking IgM
rather than C1q, suggesting that IgM protective mechanisms are partially
independent of classic complement pathway activation and apoptotic cell
clearance. Lewis et al. (2009) concluded that IgM antibodies play a
central role in protection against atherosclerosis.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
FH TURKEY
LDLR, GLN12TER

In a homozygote with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH; 143890) of
Turkish ancestry, Leitersdorf and Hobbs (1990) identified a CAG-to-TAG
change in codon 12 converting glutamine to a stop codon.

.0002
FH CAPE TOWN 1
LDLR, ASP26/GLY27DEL

In a South African black with FH (143890), Leitersdorf et al. (1988)
demonstrated deletion of aspartic acid-26 and glycine-27 due to deletion
of the 6 nucleotides of codons 26 and 27: GCGATG.

Thiart et al. (2000) found this mutation in 28% of mutant alleles in 56
South African black patients.

.0003
FH FRENCH CANADIAN 4
LDLR, TRP66GLY

This change in exon 3 is a class 3 binding-defective mutation
(Leitersdorf et al., 1990). In the French-Canadian population of a
province in Quebec, Moorjani et al. (1993) compared the clinical
features of homozygous FH (143890) because of the relatively high
frequency of a small number of mutations. In a comparison of 10 subjects
who had the trp66-to-gly (W66G) mutation in exon 3 with 11 subjects who
were homozygous for the 'greater than 10 kb' deletion of the promoter
region in exon 1 (606945.0025), they found the following: mean plasma
cholesterol concentration was higher in the subjects with the deletion
and there was no overlap in values in the 2 groups. Although the
frequency of coronary heart disease was similar in the 2 groups, age of
onset was earlier in subjects with the deletion; in addition, coronary
deaths were more frequent and occurred at an earlier age in the deletion
subjects.

Grossman et al. (1994) reported a 29-year-old woman with FH and a
homozygous W66G mutation who underwent hepatocyte-directed ex vivo gene
therapy with LDLR-expressing retroviruses. She tolerated the procedures
well, liver biopsy after 4 months showed engraftment of the transgene,
and there was no clinical or pathologic evidence for autoimmune
hepatitis. The patient showed an improvement in serum lipids up to 18
months after the treatment.

.0004
FH PUERTO RICO
LDLR, SER156LEU

Hobbs et al. (1989) found this missense mutation in a Puerto Rican
kindred that appeared to have an independently segregating mutation that
suppressed the hypercholesterolemia phenotype in some heterozygotes (see
144020). The same mutation was identified in a German family by Schuster
et al. (1993).

.0005
FH PISCATAWAY
FH LITHUANIA
LDLR, GLY197DEL

Meiner et al. (1991) found that the mutation was responsible for 35% of
71 Ashkenazi-Jewish FH (143890) families in Israel. Of the 25 Ashkenazi
patients who carried the mutant allele, 16 were of Lithuanian origin.
The mutation was not found in 47 non-Ashkenazi FH families. The mutation
was found in 8 of 10 FH cases in the Jewish community in South Africa,
which originated mainly from Lithuania. PCR amplification of a DNA
fragment that includes the mutation in heterozygous individuals results
in the formation of a heteroduplex that can be demonstrated by PAGE and
used for molecular diagnosis.

Mandelshtam et al. (1998) found this mutation in one-third (7 of 23) of
familial hypercholesterolemia cases in St. Petersburg (Russia) Jews and
in no patients of Russian descent.

.0006
FH AFRIKANER 1
FH MAINE
LDLR, ASP206GLU

Kotze et al. (1990) demonstrated a cytosine-to-guanine base substitution
at nucleotide 681 resulting in an amino acid change from aspartic acid
to glutamic acid at residue 206 (D206E) in the cysteine-rich
ligand-binding domain of the LDL receptor. The mutation gives rise to an
additional DdeI restriction site; segregation of the mutation with the
disease was confirmed in 5 large Afrikaner FH (143890) families. Kotze
et al. (1990) predicted that 65% of affected South African Afrikaners
carry this particular base substitution which can be diagnosed by PCR
amplification of genomic DNA followed by restriction enzyme analysis.
Indeed, from analysis of 138 chromosomes of Afrikaner FH (143890)
patients, Kotze et al. (1991) found this mutation in 91 (68.4%). Komuro
et al. (1987) described a homozygote for defective internalization of
the LDL receptor who survived to age 57. Leitersdorf and Hobbs (1990)
found the same mutation in an English-American living in Maine.

Vergotine et al. (2001) demonstrated the feasibility of prenatal
diagnosis of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia in an Afrikaner
family with the D206E mutation.

.0007
FH MEXICO
FH FRENCH CANADIAN 3
LDLR, GLU207LYS

Codon 207 (GAG) is changed to AAG (Leitersdorf and Hobbs, 1990). The
same mutation was found in French Canadians with FH (143890)
(Leitersdorf et al., 1990).

.0008
FH DENVER 2
LDLR, ASP283ASN

In an African American patient with FH (143890), Leitersdorf and Hobbs
(1990) found a change of aspartic acid-283 (GAC) to asparagine (AAC).

.0009
FH AFRIKANER 2
LDLR, VAL408MET

This and the asp206-to-glu mutation (see 606945.0006) are frequent among
Afrikaners with FH (143890). A GTG-to-ATG mutation is responsible
(Leitersdorf et al., 1989). In a study of 138 chromosomes of Afrikaner
FH patients, Kotze et al. (1991) found that 31 (23.3%) had this
mutation. Schuster et al. (1993) found the same mutation in a German
family and showed that it existed on the same 7-RFLP haplotype as did
the mutation described in South Africa and in the Netherlands,
suggesting a common European origin. Similarly, Defesche et al. (1993)
found the val408-to-met mutation in 19 (1.5%) of 1,268 FH patients of
Dutch descent. In 9 of the patients carrying this mutation on one
allele, the LDLR DNA haplotype was that observed in a South African FH
patient homozygous for the same mutation. The remaining 10 Dutch FH
patients all shared a common haplotype, partly identical to the
Afrikaner haplotype, which could have arisen from a single
recombinational event. With the exception of the family reported by
Schuster et al. (1993), this mutation has been described only in persons
of Dutch ancestry.

Esser and Russell (1988) found a GGC-to-GTC mutation as the basis of
this variant.

LDLR, CYS646TYR

Leitersdorf et al. (1990) found a TGT-to-TAT mutation in exon 14 as the
basis of this variant. See 606945.0003, 606945.0007, 606945.0025, and
606945.0026 for other French Canadian mutations.

.0016
FH LEBANESE
LDLR, CYS660TER

Lehrman et al. (1987) analyzed the nature of the LDLR mutation present
in high frequency in Lebanon; the frequency of homozygotes is more than
10 times higher than in other parts of the world. It was on the basis of
studies in Lebanon that Khachadurian (1964) first established the
existence of homozygous FHC (143890). Lehrman et al. (1987) demonstrated
that the mutation involves a shortened receptor protein containing 3
domains: the region of clustered O-linked carbohydrates, the
membrane-spanning region, and the cytoplasmic tail. The defect was
attributable to a single nucleotide substitution that creates a
premature termination codon at amino acid 660, eliminating 180 residues
from the mature protein. The termination codon occurred in the middle of
a cysteine-rich sequence that is part of the domain homologous to
epidermal growth factor precursor. The truncated protein retains only 2
domains: a complete ligand-binding region (residues 1-292) and a partial
epidermal growth factor precursor homology region (residues 293-659).
The mutant gene lacks the portions that code for the membrane-spanning
region and the cytoplasmic tail. After synthesis, most of the mutant
receptor remains within the cell. The mutation creates a new restriction
site for the enzyme HinfI, thus permitting diagnosis by Southern
blotting of genomic DNA. Lehrman et al. (1987) studied 4 unrelated Arab
patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, 3 from Lebanon
and 1 from Syria. They referred to this mutation as the Lebanese allele.
In 5 Christian-Arab kindreds in Israel, Oppenheim et al. (1991) found
the 'Lebanese' allele in correlation with hypercholesterolemia. In
addition, their results suggested the possible existence of an
independent factor contributing to elevated LDL cholesterol levels.

.0017
FH ZAMBIA
LDLR, PRO664LEU

In an Asiatic Indian with FH (143890), Knight et al. (1989) and Soutar
et al. (1989) found a CCG-to-CTG mutation changing proline-664 to
leucine. Knight et al. (1989) found that the precursor form of the
mutant receptor is converted more slowly than normal, and the mature
form on the cell surface binds LDL less well than normal. Soutar et al.
(1991) identified this mutation in a large Asian-Indian kindred
containing 22 heterozygotes and 3 homozygotes. All the heterozygotes had
a raised level of plasma total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein
cholesterol, but were remarkably free from premature coronary disease.
No correlation could be found between the apo(a) phenotype (152200) and
the presence or absence of the LDLR mutation. There was, however,
evidence for an inherited trait that markedly increased Lp(a)
concentration, which did not segregate with either apo(a) or the
defective LDLR allele. FH Zambia was found in a patient with familial
hypercholesterolemia who was of Indian origin residing in Zambia.
Rubinsztein et al. (1992) found the same mutation in 4 South African
families of Muslim religion who traced their origin to the vicinity of
Surat in the Gujerat province of India. Functional studies suggested
that the FH in these subjects was due to low steady-state levels of
receptor molecules that are functionally normal but exhibit accelerated
turnover.

Among 915 consecutive patients with FH and of Dutch descent, Defesche et
al. (1992) found 7 persons with the C-to-T transition at nucleotide 2054
in exon 14. All the patients shared the same haplotype. Contrary to
previous reports, no difference was found in plasma levels of Lp(a)
between family members with the mutation in exon 14 and unaffected
persons.

.0018
FH BAHRAIN
LDLR, TRP792TER

In a Bahraini patient with FH (143890), Lehrman et al. (1985) found a
change in the tryptophan-792 codon to a stop codon as the basis of this
variant. Truncation of the cytoplasmic domain of the LDLR protein
results in defective internalization. Recurrence of this mutation was
observed by Loux et al. (1991) in the course of a survey of 139
unrelated French FH subjects.

.0019

.0020
FH NASHVILLE
LDLR, 4-BP INS, EX8

In an American patient with FH (143890), Leitersdorf and Hobbs (1990)
found insertion of 4 nucleotides in exon 8 causing frameshift and
premature termination as the basis of this null allele.

.0021
FH PARIS 3
LDLR, 4-BP INS, EX17

In a French patient with FH (143890), Lehrman et al. (1985) found
insertion of 4 nucleotides in exon 17 causing frameshift and premature
termination as the basis of this internalization-defective allele.
Benlian et al. (1990) found the same duplication of 4 bases in exon 17
as the basis of familial hypercholesterolemia in a homozygous offspring
of consanguineous French parents and in heterozygous relatives. The same
mutation was not found in any normal individuals or in 158 other
individuals with hypercholesterolemia type IIa. The duplication involved
the third nucleotide of codon 796 and the 3 nucleotides of codon 797,
resulting in a frameshift and a stop codon 20 basepairs downstream.

.0022
FH PORTUGAL
LDLR, ASP203ASN

In Portuguese patients with FH (143890), Hobbs et al. (1992) identified
a G-A transition in exon 4 of the LDLR gene, resulting in an
asp203-to-asn (D203N) substitution. The mutation was not found in over
200 non-FH alleles.

.0023
FH ST. LOUIS
LDLR, EX2-8DUP

In an American child homozygous for FH (143890), Lehrman et al. (1987)
found that the LDL receptor precursor was unusually long due to a
duplication of 7 exons. Unequal crossing-over between homologous
repetitive elements (Alu sequences) in intron 1 and intron 8 was the
basis of the duplication.

.0024

.0025
FH FRENCH CANADIAN 1
FH DENVER
LDLR, PROMOTER/EX1 DEL

Deletion of the promoter and exon 1 of the LDLR gene resulting in a null
allele is the mutation found in about 60% of French Canadian cases of FH
(143890) in Quebec (Hobbs et al., 1987; Leitersdorf et al., 1990).
Leitersdorf et al. (1990) quoted work indicating that all persons with
the 'French-Canadian deletion' trace their ancestry to a small town
northeast of Montreal called Kamouraska, thus illustrating founder
effect. Founder effect was suggested as well by the fact that the
mutation was also found in France where it was, however, rare (Fumeron
et al., 1992). The same mutation was found in a non-French Canadian
Caucasian in Denver, Colorado (Hobbs et al., 1988). Betard et al. (1992)
found that the 10-kb deletion had the same haplotype, called the B
haplotype. They identified 15 different haplotypes for the normal allele
in heterozygotes. Thus, founder effect is again supported.

(It is more accurate to state that Kamouraska is northeast of Quebec
City on the south side of the St. Lawrence River. See 609313 for a
unique form of erythrokeratodermia variabilis, designated the Kamouraska
type and symbolized EKV3, that has been identified in families living in
the same region of Quebec.)

Simard et al. (2004) identified the breakpoint of the more than 15-kb
deletion involving the promoter and exon 1 of the LDLR gene, as well as
the breakpoint of the 5-kb deletion of exons 2 and 3 (606945.0026),
which accounts for 5% of French-Canadian FH cases. Both deletions
appeared to be the result of homologous recombination by unequal
crossing over between the left arms of Alu repeats. Simard et al. (2004)
determined that 55% of the LDLR gene is composed of Alu elements; thus,
it is not surprising that most LDLR rearrangements involve at least 1
Alu. They developed a rapid PCR-based assay for these 2
'French-Canadian' deletions. Screening of a representative population
sample of 943 French-Canadian youths whose LDL cholesterol levels were
above the 50th percentile allowed Simard et al. (2004) to estimate the
prevalence of the more than 15-kb allele as 0.11% (95% confidence
interval, 0.03 to 0.38).

In South African patients with FH (143890), Henderson et al. (1988)
detected a hitherto undescribed 2.5-kb deletion in the central region of
the LDLR gene, most likely including all of exons 7 and 8. The same
mutation was present in a Dutch patient in Leuven (Russell et al.,
1986).

.0029
FH ROCHESTER

LDLR, EX16-18DEL

In an American patient with FH (143890), Lehrman et al. (1985) found
deletion of exons 16, 17, and part of 18, due apparently to Alu-Alu
recombination. The same mutation was found in Japanese by Lehrman et al.
(1987) and in many Finns by Aalto-Setala et al. (1989). A 9.5-kb
deletion extended from intron 15 to exon 18. Because of loss of the
domains encoded by exons 16, 17, and 18, the carboxy-terminal portion of
the normal receptor, comprising amino acids 750-839, has been replaced
by an unrelated stretch of 55 amino acids. This particular mutation was
found in 23 of 46 unrelated Finnish FH patients with an established
functional defect of LDLR. In cultured fibroblasts, both
receptor-mediated binding and internalization of LDL were reduced on the
average by 25 and 50%, respectively. Aalto-Setala et al. (1989) referred
to the mutation as FH-Helsinki. Rodningen et al. (1992) found the same
mutation in 3 out of 181 (1.7%) unrelated Norwegian FH subjects. All 3
showed the same haplotype. Aalto-Setala et al. (1992) found that the
FH-Helsinki mutation was present in 75 (38%) of 199 unrelated Finnish
patients with hypercholesterolemia. The prevalence ranged from 26 to 58%
in different areas of Finland, with the striking exception of the North
Karelia region where only 1 of 26 (4%) FH patients carried the
FH-Helsinki allele.

In the Icelandic population, Taylor et al. (1989) found this deletion.
However, in 17 unrelated families from Iceland, Taylor et al. (1989)
identified at least 4 different haplotypes, indicating that FH (143890)
is a heterogeneous disease even in this small, geographically isolated
population.

LDLR, EX17-18DEL

In an American Caucasian with FH (143890), Hobbs et al. (1990) found a

resulting in the deletion of exons 17 and 18.

.0041

LDLR, EX13-15DUP

In a survey of Italian patients with FH (143890), Lelli et al. (1991)
identified a heterozygous patient with an insertion in the LDLR gene
that represented a duplication of exons 13, 14, and 15.

Graadt van Roggen et al. (1991) found a G-to-A transition in codon 154
resulting in substitution of asparagine for aspartic acid.

FH DRUZE
LDLR, TYR167TER

In FH (143890) families from 2 distinct Druze villages from the Golan
Heights in northern Israel, Landsberger et al. (1992) found a TAC-to-TAG
substitution in codon 167, changing the sense from tyrosine to stop. The
mutation was in exon 4, which encodes the fourth repeat of the binding
domain of the mature receptor. Landsberger et al. (1992) presented
demographic data concerning the Druze.

.0046
FH PAVIA
LDLR, EX2-12DEL

Bertolini et al. (1992) found a large rearrangement of the LDLR gene in
3 apparently unrelated families segregating for FH (143890) living in
northern Italy. Southern blot analysis demonstrated heterozygosity for a
25-kb deletion eliminating exons 2-12. The affected subjects possessed 2
LDL receptor mRNA species: one of normal size (5.3 kb) and one of
smaller size (3.5 kb). In the latter mRNA, the coding sequence of exon 1
was joined to the coding sequence of exon 13, causing a change in the
reading frame and thereby giving rise to a premature stop codon. The
predicted receptor protein, a short polypeptide of 29 amino acids, would
be expected to be devoid of any function. Bertolini et al. (1992) found
a common ancestor for the 3 families who had lived in the 17th century
in a region called Lomellina in southwest Lombardy, near Pavia.

.0047
FH NORTH KARELIA
LDLR, 7-BP DEL, EX6

Koivisto et al. (1992) identified a mutation found in many Finnish
patients with heterozygous FH (143890). The mutation, designated FH
North Karelia (FH-NK) , deleted 7 nucleotides from exon 6 of the LDLR
gene, caused a translational frameshift, and was predicted to result in
a truncated receptor protein. The mutation was found in 69 (34%) of 201
unrelated Finnish FH patients and was especially frequent (prevalence
79%) in patients from eastern Finland. FH Helsinki (606945.0029) and FH
North Karelia together account for about two-thirds of FH mutations in
Finland.

In Finnish North Karelia, with a population of about 180,000, Vuorio et
al. (1997) found that the FH-NK mutation accounts for 84% (340 of 407)
of FH cases, while the FH-Helsinki allele was found in 4% (18 cases).
The minimum prevalence of FH in North Karelia was estimated to be 1 in
441 inhabitants; in 1 commune, a frequency of 1 in 143 was found. By use
of parish and tax records, they identified a common ancestor for most of
the North Karelian FH-NK persons in the village of Puso, located within
an area where the FH prevalence is the highest. DNA analysis indicated
that 2% of subjects aged 1 to 25 years would have been diagnosed as
false-negative and 7% as false-positive FH patients on the basis of LDL
cholesterol determinations alone. Coronary heart disease (CHD) was
present in 65 (30%) of the 179 FH gene carriers aged 25 years or more,
and 19 individuals had a previous history of acute myocardial
infarction. The average age at onset of CHD was 42 years for males and
48 years for females.

FH LONDON 3
LDLR, CYS210TER

In an Irish subject with familial hypercholesterolemia (143890), 1 of
200 patients attending lipid clinics in the London area, Gudnason et al.
(1993) found a GCG-to-GAG transversion changing cys210 to a stop codon.

.0049
FH LONDON 4
LDLR, 2-BP DEL, 694AC

In 5 patients of British extraction with familial hypercholesterolemia
(143890), Gudnason et al. (1993) found deletion of the last 2 bases (694
and 695) of codon 206 (GAC).

.0050
FH OSAKA 3
LDLR, ASP412HIS

In a Japanese patient with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia
(143890), Miyake et al. (1992) identified a G-to-C transversion in exon
9 which was predicted to change asp412 to his. The amino acid change
occurred in the epidermal growth-factor-precursor homology domain of the
LDL receptor. Both in the fibroblasts of the patient and in transfected
COS-1 cells, the mutant protein showed impaired processing and rapid
degradation. Members of the family carrying the mutant gene in
heterozygous state showed higher serum cholesterol levels than the
others; however, cholesterol levels were also influenced by the
apolipoprotein E phenotype. The mutant LDLR reported by Miyake et al.
(1992) is designated here FH Osaka-3.

.0051
FH AFRIKANER 4
LDLR, 18-BP DUP

Kotze et al. (1995) identified a de novo duplication in the LDLR gene in
the course of screening hypercholesterolemics who did not have 1 of the
3 known mutations responsible for the high frequency of FH (143890)
(more than 1/100) in South African Afrikaners. The de novo duplication
of 18 basepairs in exon 4 occurred after nucleotide 678 (or 681) of
their sequence. The authors suggested that the resultant change is
severe, because the corresponding duplicated amino acids 200-205 (or
201-206) are highly conserved in E/apo B binding repeat 5 of LDLC. One
of the daughters of the index patient inherited the defective LDLR gene,
which was absent in both grandparents. Kotze et al. (1995) suggested
that this was the first report of a molecularly characterized de novo
mutation associated with FH.

.0052
FH TURKU
LDLR, GLY823ASP

Two deletions, designated FH-Helsinki (143890.0029) and FH-North Karelia
(143890.0047), account for the mutations present in approximately 60 to
70% of all heterozygous FH (143890) probands in Finland. Koivisto et al.
(1995) screened the DNA samples from a cohort representing the remaining
30% of heterozygous patients by amplifying all 18 exons of the LDLR gene
by PCR and searching for DNA variations with the SSCP technique. Ten
novel mutations were identified, comprising 2 nonsense and 7 missense
mutations, as well as 1 frameshift mutation caused by a 13-bp deletion.
Koivisto et al. (1995) found a single nucleotide change, substituting
adenine for guanine at position 2533 of their sequence and resulting in
a gly823-to-asp amino acid change, in DNA samples from 14 unrelated FH
probands. The mutation, designated FH-Turku, affected the sequence
encoding the putative basolateral sorting signal of the LDL receptor
protein. The FH-Turku gene and another point mutation, FH-Pori (leu380
to his; 606945.0053), accounted for approximately 8% of the FH-causing
gene alterations in Finland and were found to be particularly common
among FH patients from the southwestern part of the country. The
FH-Turku missense mutation was the one closest to the C terminus of LDLR
identified to date.

Koivisto et al. (2001) showed that the FH-Turku mutant receptor is
mistargeted to the apical surface in both Madin-Darby canine kidney
(MDCK) cells and hepatic epithelial cells, resulting in reduced
endocytosis of LDL from the basolateral/sinusoidal surface.
Consequently, virally encoded mutant receptor fails to mediate
cholesterol clearance in LDL receptor-deficient mice, suggesting that a
defect in polarized LDL receptor expression in hepatocytes underlies the
hypercholesterolemia in patients harboring this allele. This evidence
directly links the pathogenesis of a human disease to defects in
basolateral targeting signals, providing a genetic confirmation of these
signals in maintaining epithelial cell polarity.

FH ELVERUM
LDLR, IVS3, G-A, +1

In Norway, Leren et al. (1994) identified a splice mutation, a G-to-A
change of the first base of intron 3 destroying the conserved GT splice
donor site of intron 3 of the LDLR gene. The same mutation was reported
in patients with FH (143890) in England (Sun et al., 1995) and Germany
(Feussner et al., 1996).

.0055
FH AARHUS
LDLR, ASN543HIS AND 9-BP DEL

During a survey of mutations of the LDL receptor gene in Danish patients
with familial hypercholesterolemia (143890), using SSCP analysis, Jensen
et al. (1997) observed different patterns in exons 11 and 17 from 2
apparently unrelated FH index cases indicating the presence of 2
different mutations. No other mutations were identified by analysis of
the remaining 16 exons and the promoter region. The mutation in exon 11
was found to be a 1690A-C transversion, causing an N543H amino acid
substitution. In exon 17, they identified a 9-bp deletion of nucleotides
2393-2405 (2393del9). This sequence contains a 4-bp repeat of the
nucleotides TCCT at the end. It was therefore likely that the 9-bp
deletion had occurred due to 'slipped mispairing mutagenesis,' involving
mispairing of the 4-bp repeat during replication. The deletion did not
cause a frameshift, and the mutant allele coded, therefore, for an LDL
receptor protein lacking 3 amino acids in the membrane-spanning domain:
leu778, val779, and phe780. The 2 mutations were in the same allele of
the LDLR gene. Each of these mutations alone had little or no effect on
receptor function in transfected COS cells, but when both mutations were
present simultaneously, receptor function, as assessed by flow
cytometric measurement of fluorescent LDL uptake in cells, was reduced
by 75%. Immunostainable receptors on the cell surface were decreased by
80% as measured by flow cytometry. The 2 mutations therefore acted in
synergy to affect receptor function, possibly during intracellular
receptor transport, since Northern blot analysis suggested that mRNA
levels were unaffected. Jensen et al. (1997) noted that double mutations
had been reported in several clinically relevant genes, such as the HEXA
gene (606869.0036) and the CFTR gene (602421) (Savov et al., 1995). In
most of these disorders, one mutation was found to be causative, and the
other modified the onset or severity of the disease. The common
methionine-valine polymorphism in the PRNP gene (176640.0005) modifies
both qualitatively and quantitatively the phenotypic expression of the
pathogenic D178N mutation (176640.0010) resulting in 2 different
disorders: fatal familial insomnia and familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease (Goldfarb et al., 1992). Jensen et al. (1997) stated that in the
case of the LDLR double mutant, there appeared to be a true synergistic
action.

.0056
FH ICELAND
LDLR, IVS4, T-C, +2

Gudnason et al. (1997) stated that haplotype analysis in 18 apparently
unrelated families with FH (143890) in Iceland has identified at least 5
different chromosomes cosegregating with hypercholesterolemia. The most
common haplotype was identified in 11 of the 18 families, indicating a
founder mutation. By using SSCP analysis and direct sequencing of
amplified DNA, Gudnason et al. (1997) identified a T-to-C transition in
the second nucleotide in the 5-prime part of intron 4 of the LDLR gene.
This mutation was present in 10 of the 18 families. In half of the
cases, these families could be traced to a common ancestor by going back
no further than the 18th century. The mutation was predicted to affect
correct splicing of exon 4, and analysis at the cellular level
demonstrated an abnormal mRNA containing intron 4 sequence in
lymphoblastoid cells from a patient carrying the mutation. Translation
of the mRNA would lead to a premature stop codon and a truncated
nonfunctional protein of 285 amino acids.

.0058
FH GLASCO
LDLR, CYS163TYR

Lee et al. (1998) reported that in the West of Scotland, in the Glasco
area, about half of the index cases of familial hypercholesterolemia
(143890) were found to have the cys163-to-tyr mutation of the LDLR gene.

.0059
HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA, FAMILIAL
LDLR, CYS240PHE

In a 13-year-old girl with severe hypercholesterolemia (143890), Ekstrom
et al. (1999) demonstrated compound heterozygosity for a cys240-to-phe
mutation and a tyr167-to-ter mutation (606945.0045) in the LDLR gene.
Fibroblasts from the patient showed very low cholesterol esterification
rate, LDL uptake, and degradation as compared to normal fibroblasts. Her
2 heterozygous sibs also carried the C240F mutation, but only one of
them was hypercholesterolemic. Ekstrom et al. (1999) expressed the C240F
mutant in LDLR-deficient CHOldlA7 cells. The transfected cells produced
a detectable protein but were unable to mediate uptake or degradation of
LDL. The authors concluded that there may be cholesterol-lowering
mechanisms that can be activated, perhaps by mutations in known or
hitherto unknown genes.

.0060
HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA, FAMILIAL
LDLR, TRP23TER

In patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (143890), Hobbs et al.
(1992) identified a trp23-to-ter mutation in the LDLR gene.

.0061
HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA, FAMILIAL
LDLR, CYS25SER

In a Japanese patient with familial hypercholesterolemia (143890),
Takahashi et al. (2001) identified a G-to-C transversion at nucleotide
137 of the LDLR gene, resulting in a cys25-to-ser (C25S) amino acid
substitution in the ligand-binding site (mutation class 2B: slow
transport and processing). The patient first noticed xanthomas on both
elbows at the age of 5 years. These continued to increase in number and
size. At age 40 years, xanthomas were present on elbows, palms, knees,
and feet. Clinical manifestations of myocardial ischemia developed at
age 41. Selective LDL filtration was initiated after plasma apheresis
through a macromolecular exclusion filter. With bimonthly treatments,
her LDL cholesterol decreased by approximately 50% and the xanthomas
regressed markedly, almost disappearing with 5 years of treatment.

.0062
HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA, FAMILIAL
LDLR, CYS88SER

Pisciotta et al. (2002) identified a de novo LDLR mutation in a
47-year-old white male who at the age of 43 had suffered a myocardial
infarction. He was heterozygous for a G-to-C transversion in exon 4,
which resulted in a serine for cysteine substitution at position 88
(C88S) of the receptor protein. The mutation was not found in his
parents (nonpaternity was excluded), but it was present in his
9-year-old son, who had familial hypercholesterolemia (143890).
Haplotype analysis indicated that this de novo mutation occurred in the
paternal germline.

.0063
HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA, FAMILIAL
LDLR, IVS14, G-A, +1

Takada et al. (2002) described a novel splice site mutation in the LDLR
gene, IVS14+1G-A, which genealogic research confirmed was shared by 14
of 1,135 members of an American Caucasian pedigree descended from a
common ancestor and affected with familial hypercholesterolemia
(143890). The mutation resulted in an abruptly truncated LDLR protein,
reducing functional LDLR activity by half in heterozygous carriers of
the mutant allele. Takada et al. (2002) stated this was the largest
familial hypercholesterolemia kindred described, and of 208 members
screened for this LDLR mutation, 94 carriers and 114 noncarriers were
identified. Strikingly lower total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol
values were observed among most of the LDLR mutation carriers who were
simultaneously homozygous for the -265C allele of the -265C-T
polymorphism of the APOA2 gene (107670.0002). In vitro transfection
assays showed that transcriptional activity of the APOA2 promoter was
reduced by 30% in the -265C allele as compared with the -265T allele.
The variant of the APOA2 gene was associated with reduced plasma LDL
cholesterol only in familial hypercholesterolemia patients.

In the same large family reported by Takada et al. (2002), Takada et al.
(2003) found that a SNP in the growth hormone receptor gene (GHR),
resulting in a L526I (600946.0028) substitution, influenced plasma
levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in affected family
members with the LDLR mutation. The lowest levels of plasma HDL were
observed among leu/leu homozygotes, highest levels among ile/ile
homozygotes, and intermediate levels among leu/ile heterozygotes. No
such effect was observed among noncarriers of the LDLR mutation.

In the pedigree reported by Takada et al. (2002), Sato et al. (2004)
demonstrated a significant modification of the phenotype of familial
hypercholesterolemia resulting from the IVS14+1G-A mutation by the
arg287 variation in the EPHX2 gene (132811.0001).

.0064
FH PYRGOS
LDLR, -45T DEL

In a patient with familial hypercholesterolemia (143890), Dedoussis et
al. (2003) identified a novel mutation in repeat 3 of the LDLR gene
promoter, -45delT. Analysis of a neutral polymorphism in LDLR mRNA from
the patient's white blood cells showed that the expression of 1 allele
was significantly reduced, and cells had only 24% of LDLR activity by
binding and uptake of iodine-labeled LDL. Transient transfection studies
using a luciferase gene reporter revealed that the -45delT mutation
considerably reduced the transcriptional activity of the LDLR promoter
and strongly suggested that the mutation was the cause of the familial
hypercholesterolemia phenotype. The proband was a female in her late
thirties; her father was reported to have elevated cholesterol levels
and had undergone bypass surgery at the age of 70.

.0065
HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA, FAMILIAL
LDLR, ARG385ARG

In a patient diagnosed with probable heterozygous familial
hypercholesterolemia (143890), who had tendinous xanthomas and angina
since the age of 29 years, Bourbon et al. (2007) identified
heterozygosity for a 1216C-A transversion in exon 9 of the LDLR gene,
resulting in a synonymous arg385-to-arg (R385R) change. However,
analysis of mRNA from the patient's cells showed that the mutation
introduces a new 5-prime acceptor splice site that is used to the
exclusion of the natural splice site and causes a 31-bp deletion
predicted to result in premature termination 4 codons beyond the change.
Review of previous LDLR gene sequencing data revealed that the same base
substitution was present in a Chinese homozygous FH patient in whom no
other mutation in LDLR had been found. The authors stated that the
difference in origins of the 2 patients suggested that the mutation was
very unlikely to have been inherited from a common ancestor and that it
might be present in other populations as well.

Defesche et al. (2008) analyzed the LDLR gene in 1,350 patients
clinically diagnosed with familial hypercholesterolemia who were
negative for functional DNA variation in known hypercholesterolemia
genes and identified the R385R variant in 2 probands, both of Chinese
origin, and their family members. In view of the faint band representing
the aberrantly spliced mRNA on gel electrophoresis, the authors
suggested that this DNA variant likely leads to nonsense-mediated mRNA
decay.

.0066
HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA, FAMILIAL
LDLR, GLY186GLY

In 35 unrelated Dutch patients clinically diagnosed with familial
hypercholesterolemia who were negative for functional DNA variation in
known hypercholesterolemia genes, Defesche et al. (2008) identified a
621C-T transition in exon 4 of the LDLR gene, resulting in a synonymous
gly186-to-gly (G186G) change, that introduces a 3-prime splice donor
site with a higher 'probability score' than the naturally occurring
3-prime splice site 75 bp downstream. Analysis of cDNA synthesized from
total RNA revealed that the aberrant splicing results in a 75-bp
in-frame deletion and a stable mRNA, predicted to produce an LDLR
protein lacking a 25-amino acid fragment (gly186 to cys210). The variant
was found in homozygosity in 2 of the probands, who had LDL cholesterol
levels of 14.8 and 10.5 mmol/L, respectively, and who both suffered
myocardial infarctions before the age of 20 years. The variant was also
identified in 62 first-degree relatives of the index cases.

.0067
HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA, FAMILIAL
LDLR, IVS14, C-G, +86

In a proband with clinically defined hypercholesterolemia (143890),
Kulseth et al. (2010) identified heterozygosity for a splice site
mutation (2140+86C-G) in intron 14 of the LDLR gene, activating a
cryptic splice site that results in aberrantly spliced mRNA containing
an 81-bp insertion. Twelve of 23 family members tested were heterozygous
for the mutation, and carriers had significantly increased total
cholesterol levels compared to noncarriers. The 2140+86C-G mutation was
found in 3 additional probands with hypercholesterolemia, and in 1
proband's family the mutation was found in 6 of 7 tested family members,
who all had LDL cholesterol levels above the 97th percentile. RT-PCR
analysis in 1 affected individual from that family showed that the
mutant allele mainly gave rise to aberrantly spliced mRNA, but
contributed 21% normal transcripts. Transfection studies in CHO cells
demonstrated retention of mutant LDLR in the endoplasmic reticulum,
presumably due to protein misfolding.

600187	TITLE *600187 EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 5A; EIF5A
;;EIF5A1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The eukaryotic initiation factor 5A is an 18-kD protein composed of 154
amino acids. It contains a unique amino acid residue, hypusine, that is
formed posttranslationally via the transfer and hydroxylation of the
butylamino-group from the polyamine spermidine to a lys50 within the
EIF5A protein. Koettnitz et al. (1994) isolated and characterized the
human EIF5A pseudogene. Subsequently, Koettnitz et al. (1995) identified
a genomic clone encoding a functional EIF5A. The authors showed that
this sequence could successfully complement yeast carrying the HYP2
mutation (the homolog of EIF5A), whereas the pseudogenes could not.

GENE STRUCTURE

Koettnitz et al. (1995) found that the human EIF5A gene contains at
least 4 exons and spans at least 4.8 kb.

GENE FUNCTION

Saini et al. (2009) used molecular genetic and biochemical studies to
show that EIF5A promotes translation elongation. Depletion or
inactivation of EIF5A in the yeast S. cerevisiae resulted in the
accumulation of polysomes and an increase in ribosomal transit times.
Addition of recombinant EIF5A from yeast, but not a derivative lacking
hypusine, enhanced the rate of tripeptide synthesis in vitro. Moreover,
inactivation of EIF5A mimicked the effects of the EEF2 (130610)
inhibitor sordarin, indicating that EIF5A might function together with
EEF2 to promote ribosomal translocation. Because EIF5A is a structural
homolog of the bacterial protein EF-P, Saini et al. (2009) proposed that
EIF5A/EF-P is a universally conserved translation elongation factor.

To identify tumor suppressor genes in lymphoma (605027), Scuoppo et al.
(2012) screened a short hairpin RNA library targeting genes deleted in
human lymphomas and functionally confirmed those in a mouse lymphoma
model. Of the 9 tumor suppressors identified, 8 corresponded to genes
occurring in 3 physically linked 'clusters,' suggesting that the common
occurrence of large chromosomal deletions in human tumors reflects
selective pressure to attenuate multiple genes. Among the newly
identified tumor suppressors were adenosylmethionine decarboxylase-1
(AMD1; 180980) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A),
2 genes associated with hypusine, a unique amino acid produced as a
product of polyamine metabolism through a highly conserved pathway.
Through a secondary screen surveying the impact of all polyamine enzymes
on tumorigenesis, Scuoppo et al. (2012) established the
polyamine-hypusine axis as a new tumor suppressor network regulating
apoptosis. Unexpectedly, heterozygous deletions encompassing AMD1 and
eIF5A often occur together in human lymphomas, and cosuppression of both
genes promotes lymphomagenesis in mice. Thus, Scuoppo et al. (2012)
concluded that some tumor suppressor functions can be disabled through a
2-step process targeting different genes acting in the same pathway.

Translation elongation factor P (EF-P) is critical for virulence in
bacteria. EF-P is present in all bacteria and orthologous to archaeal
and eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (a/eIF5A). Ude et al. (2013)
demonstrated that EF-P is an elongation factor that enhances translation
of polyproline-containing proteins: in the absence of EF-P, ribosomes
stall at polyproline stretches, whereas the presence of EF-P alleviates
the translational stalling. Moreover, Ude et al. (2013) demonstrated the
physiologic relevance of EF-P to fine-tune the expression of the
polyproline-containing pH receptor CadC to levels necessary for an
appropriate stress response. Bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic cells
have hundreds to thousands of polyproline-containing proteins of diverse
function, suggesting that EF-P and a/elF5A are critical for copy number
adjustment of multiple pathways across all kingdoms of life.

Doerfel et al. (2013) showed that EF-P prevents the ribosome from
stalling during synthesis of proteins containing consecutive prolines,
such as PPG, PPP, or longer proline strings, in natural and engineered
model proteins. EF-P promotes peptide-bond formation and stabilizes the
peptidyl-transfer RNA in the catalytic center of the ribosome. EF-P is
posttranslationally modified by a hydroxylated beta-lysine attached to a
lysine residue. The modification enhances the catalytic proficiency of
the factor mainly by increasing its affinity to the ribosome. Doerfel et
al. (2013) proposed that EF-P and its eukaryotic homolog, elF5A, are
essential for the synthesis of a subset of proteins containing proline
stretches in all cells.

MAPPING

Steinkasserer et al. (1995) mapped the EIF5A gene to 17p13-p12 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. Three pseudogenes were mapped to
10q23.3, 17q25, and 19q13.2.

610113	TITLE *610113 ADAMTS-LIKE 4; ADAMTSL4
;;THROMBOSPONDIN REPEAT-CONTAINING 1; TSRC1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ADAMTSL4 belongs to a family of proteins that share significant
similarity with the ADAMTS family of metalloprotease (see ADAMTS1;
605174). However, ADAMTS-like proteins lack the zinc-binding
metalloprotease domain of ADAMTS proteins and are therefore secreted
glycoproteins rather than enzymes (summary by Gabriel et al., 2012).

CLONING

By database analysis and PCR analysis of mouse brain, Buchner and
Meisler (2003) cloned Adamtsl4, which they called Tsrc1. By database
searching with the mouse Adamtsl4 sequence, they identified human
ADAMTSL4. The deduced human and mouse proteins contain 1,074 and 1,036
amino acids, respectively, and share 76% sequence identity. The proteins
contain 7 predicted thrombospondin type 1 (TSP1) repeats, 6 of which are
clustered at the C-terminal end. The thrombospondin domains are most
closely related to the ADAMTS (a disintegrin-like and metalloproteinase
with thrombospondin type 1 repeats) subfamily. Northern blot analysis
detected a 4.4-kb mouse Adamtsl4 transcript in muscle, brain, and other
tissues; RT-PCR analysis confirmed expression in all fetal and adult
tissues examined.

Ahram et al. (2009) amplified first-strand cDNA from adult human tissue
and found expression of ADAMTSL4 in colon, heart, leukocyte, liver,
lung, skeletal muscle, spleen, testis, and placenta; expression was
weaker in bone marrow, brain tissue, kidney, and pancreas. Expression
studies in fetal tissue revealed strong expression in heart, kidney,
liver, lung, and skeletal muscle, but weaker expression in brain and
skin.

Using Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses, Gabriel et al.
(2012) found that ADAMTSL4 was widely expressed in normal human eye and
was associated with both cells and extracellular medium. Western blot
analysis of conditioned medium from transfected HEK293F cells showed
that ADAMTSL4 was secreted as a major N- and O-glycosylated species with
an apparent molecular mass of 150 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Fibroblasts secrete fibrillin-1 (FBN1; 134797) and deposit it into
microfibrils after a period of confluence. Gabriel et al. (2012) showed
that conditioned medium containing human ADAMTSL4 accelerated the
deposition of Fbn1 into microfibrils by fetal bovine nunchal ligament
fibroblasts.

GENE STRUCTURE

Buchner and Meisler (2003) determined that the ADAMTSL4 gene contains 17
coding exons and 2 untranslated exons and spans about 10 kb of genomic
DNA.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Buchner and Meisler (2003) mapped the human
ADAMTSL4 gene to chromosome 1q21. They mapped the mouse Adamtsl4 gene in
a region of syntenic homology on chromosome 3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a large consanguineous Arab family of Jordanian origin with isolated
ectopia lentis mapping to chromosome 1p13.2-q21.1 (ECTOL2; 225100),
originally reported by Al-Salem (1990), Ahram et al. (2009) identified
homozygosity for a nonsense mutation in the ADAMTSL4 gene (610113.0001)
that segregated with the phenotype and was not found in 380 ethnically
matched control chromosomes.

In 2 Turkish brothers with isolated ectopia lentis who were negative for
mutation in the FBN1 gene (134797), Greene et al. (2010) identified
homozygosity for a splice site mutation in the ADAMTSL4 gene
(610113.0002).

In 10 affected individuals from 5 Norwegian families with ectopia lentis
et pupillae (225200), Christensen et al. (2010) identified homozygosity
for a 20-bp deletion in the ADAMTSL4 gene (610113.0003). There was
evidence for a founder effect in this population. In 1 family, 1 of the
3 affected individuals had bilateral downward dislocation of the lenses
but normally positioned pupils.

In 6 patients with FBN1-negative ectopia lentis, including 1 who had
ectopia lentis et pupillae, Aragon-Martin et al. (2010) identified
homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the ADAMTSL4 gene,
including the 20-bp deletion reported by Christensen et al. (2010) (see,
e.g., 610113.0003-610113.0005).

In 8 patients from 7 German families with isolated ectopia lentis,
Neuhann et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for the 20-bp deletion in
the ADAMTSL4 gene. A 4-SNP haplotype was consistently associated with
the mutation, suggestive of a founder mutation.

Chandra et al. (2012) identified mutations in the ADAMTSL4 gene in 8
Caucasian British probands with isolated ectopia lentis, including 6 who
were homozygous for the 20-bp deletion and 1 who was compound
heterozygous for the 20-bp deletion and a 1-bp deletion (610113.0006).
Another Caucasian British proband, who had ectopia lentis et pupillae,
was found to be compound heterozygous for the 20-bp deletion and a 1-bp
insertion in ADAMTSL4 (610113.0007).

In affected members of a large consanguineous Arab family of Jordanian
origin with isolated ectopia lentis (ECTOL2; 225100), originally
reported by Al-Salem (1990), Ahram et al. (2009) identified homozygosity
for a 1785T-G transversion in exon 11 of the ADAMTSL4 gene, resulting in
a tyr595-to-ter (Y595X) substitution at an evolutionarily conserved
residue, predicted to generate a truncated protein of 594 residues
lacking 6 of the 7 TSP1 repeats. The mutation segregated with the
phenotype in the family and was not found in 380 ethnically matched
control chromosomes.

In 2 Turkish boys with isolated ectopia lentis (ECTOL2; 225100), born of
consanguineous parents, Greene et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for
a -1G-A transition in intron 4 of the ADAMTSL4 gene that abolishes the
splice acceptor site and creates a premature stop codon. Their
unaffected parents were heterozygous for the mutation, which was not
found in the SNP database and was not described as a physiologic splice

ADAMTSL4, 20-BP DEL, NT767

In 10 affected individuals from 5 Norwegian families with ectopia lentis
et pupillae (225200), Christensen et al. (2010) identified homozygosity
for a 20-bp deletion (767_786del20) in the ADAMTSL4 gene, causing a
frameshift predicted to result in a stop codon and premature truncation
113 bp downstream. RT-PCR analysis of ADAMTSL4 mRNA confirmed the
presence of a transcript truncated by 20 bp. Obligate heterozygotes had
no ocular abnormalities. Homozygosity mapping in the 5 Norwegian
families from Hordaland County in western Norway was compatible with a
common ancestor 150 generations (4,000 years) earlier, and the mutation
was found in heterozygosity in 3 of 190 local blood donors,
corresponding to a prevalence for homozygosity of approximately 1:16,000
in this population. In 1 family, 1 of the 3 affected individuals had
bilateral downward dislocation of the lenses but normally positioned
pupils.

In a 15-year-old boy with isolated ectopia lentis (ECTOL2; 252100),
Aragon-Martin et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for the 20-bp
deletion in exon 6 of the ADAMTSL4 gene. The 20-bp deletion was also
identified in compound heterozygosity with an 11-bp deletion
(826_836del11; 610113.0004) in ADAMTSL4 in 2 affected members of a
Caucasian British family with ectopia lentis and in an 8-year-old
Swedish boy with ectopia lentis et pupillae.

In 8 patients from 7 German families with isolated ectopia lentis,
Neuhann et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for the 20-bp deletion in
the ADAMTSL4 gene, which they designated 759_778del20. The mutation was
found in heterozygosity in unaffected parents and sibs, as well as in 2
of 360 controls. A 4-SNP haplotype was consistently associated with the
mutation, suggestive of a founder mutation.

In 6 Caucasian British patients with isolated ectopia lentis, Chandra et
al. (2012) identified homozygosity for the ADAMTSL4 20-bp deletion. Two
more Caucasian British patients, 1 with isolated ectopia lentis and 1
with ectopia lentis et pupillae, were found to be compound heterozygous
for the 20-bp deletion and 2 different frameshift mutations: a 1-bp
deletion (237delC; 610113.0006) and a 1-bp duplication (2270dupG;
610113.0007), respectively, in the ADAMTSL4 gene.

;;ZFD25;;
ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 588, FORMERLY; ZNF588, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Zinc finger proteins (ZNFs), which bind nucleic acids, perform many key
functions, the most important of which is regulating transcription. See
ZNF91 (603971) for general information on ZNFs.

CLONING

By PCR-based screening of a human genomic YAC library using degenerate
oligonucleotides corresponding to a consensus sequence of the spacer
region of ZNF91 family members, Bellefroid et al. (1993) identified 23
distinct ZNF91-related genes, including ZNF107. They demonstrated that
members of the ZNF91 family are widely expressed in human tissues, with
the highest expression in T-lymphoid cells.

By sequence analysis of a human aorta-specific cDNA, followed by 5-prime
RACE of human brain cDNA, Li et al. (1999) cloned ZNF107, which they
called ZFD25. The deduced 783-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 90.67 kD and contains 25 C2H2-type zinc fingers.
ZNF107 shares 70% homology with both ZNF91 and ZNF117 (194624). The
5-prime untranslated region contains a KRAB domain. Northern blot
analysis detected a 6.2-kb transcript in human brain, heart, skeletal
muscle, kidney, and pancreas. RT-PCR analysis detected expression in
human aorta, liver, lung, and cultured umbilical vein endothelial cells,
umbilical artery smooth muscle cells, and HepG2 cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Li et al. (1999) showed that ZNF107 expression in cultured human
umbilical vein endothelial cells decreased in response to a shift from
20% fetal calf serum to serum-free media. They suggested that ZNF107 may
play a role in serum-dependent cellular processes, such as cell
proliferation and survival.

MAPPING

By FISH, Bellefroid et al. (1993) mapped a YAC clone containing the
ZNF107 gene to 7q11.2.

;;KIAA0765
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Stover et al. (2001) cloned a partial cDNA encoding a member of the
RNA-binding motif protein family, RBM12, from a human colon carcinoma
cell line cDNA library. They cloned the full-length cDNA from an acute
monocytic leukemia cell line cDNA library and found that it is identical
to a partial cDNA, KIAA0765, isolated from a brain cDNA library by
Nagase et al. (1998). The full-length cDNA encodes a deduced 932-amino
acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 97 kD. It contains 5
RNA-binding motifs, several potential transmembrane domains, and 2
proline-rich regions that coincide with 2 of the transmembrane domains.
The RBM12 protein has a nuclear targeting sequence and a mitochondrial
targeting sequence, but no signal sequence. Northern blot analysis
detected abundant expression of a 3.5-kb transcript in all cell lines
tested.

GENE STRUCTURE

Stover et al. (2001) determined that the RBM12 gene contains 2 exons and
spans approximately 10 kb. The structure of the gene is unusual in that
its 1 intron is located in the 5-prime untranslated region and the
complete coding sequence is transcribed from a single exon. Southern
blot analysis indicated that RBM12 is present in single copy.

MAPPING

By FISH, Stover et al. (2001) mapped the RBM12 gene to chromosome
20q11.2.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

HIF is a transcriptional complex that plays a central role in mammalian
oxygen homeostasis. Posttranslational modification by prolyl
hydroxylation is a key regulatory event that targets HIF-alpha (HIF1;
603348) subunits for proteasomal destruction via the von Hippel-Lindau
(VHL; 608537) ubiquitylation complex. Epstein et al. (2001) defined a
conserved HIF-VHL-prolyl hydroxylase pathway in C. elegans and
identified Egl9 as a dioxygenase that regulates HIF by prolyl
hydroxylation. In mammalian cells, they showed that the HIF-prolyl
hydroxylases are represented by 3 proteins with a conserved
2-histidine-1-carboxylate iron coordination motif at the catalytic site.
The genes encoding these proteins were cloned and termed PHD1, PHD2
(606425), and PHD3 (606426) by the authors. Direct modulation of
recombinant enzyme activity by graded hypoxia, iron chelation, and
cobaltous ions mirrored the characteristics of HIF induction in vivo,
fulfilling requirements for these enzymes being oxygen sensors that
regulate HIF.

Bruick and McKnight (2001) independently identified the conserved family
of HIF prolyl hydroxylase enzymes, which they called HPH1, 2, and 3,
respectively, that appear to be responsible for the posttranslational
modification of HIF that targets it for ubiquitination.

By quantitative RT-PCR, Oehme et al. (2002) found highest EGLN2
expression in testis, with much lower expression in the 16 other human
tissues examined.

Independently, Hirsila et al. (2003) cloned HIFP4H1, HIFP4H2, and
HIFP4HD3 by PCR of human colon, aorta, and lung cDNA. The deduced
407-amino acid HIFP4H1 protein contains a C-terminal catalytic domain
with motifs for binding iron and the C5 carboxyl group of
2-oxoglutarate. PCR analysis of adult and fetal samples revealed HIFP4H1
expression in all tissues examined, with highest expression in adult
brain, placenta, lung, and kidney.

GENE FUNCTION

In cultured mammalian cells, Bruick and McKnight (2001) found that the
inappropriate accumulation of HIF caused by forced expression of the
HIF1-alpha subunit under normoxic conditions was attenuated by
coexpression of HPH. Suppression of HPH in cultured Drosophila
melanogaster cells by RNA interference resulted in elevated expression
of the hypoxia-inducible gene LDH (see 150000) under normoxic
conditions. Bruick and McKnight (2001) concluded that HPH is an
essential component of the pathway through which cells sense oxygen.

Using recombinant proteins expressed in insect cells, Hirsila et al.
(2003) found that HIFP4H1, HIFP4H2, and HIFP4H3 showed in vitro
2-oxoglutarate-dependent hydroxylation of a 19-residue peptide
corresponding to the C-terminal prolyl hydroxylation site of HIF1-alpha.
All 3 enzymes showed lower or no activity against a peptide
corresponding to a more N-terminal putative prolyl hydroxylation site in
HIF1-alpha. All 3 enzymes hydroxylated peptides designed from putative
prolyl hydroxylation sites of human HIF2-alpha (EPAS1; 603349),
HIF3-alpha (HIF3A; 609976), and C. elegans HIF-alpha.

Nakayama et al. (2004) demonstrated that PHD1 and PHD3 abundance is
regulated via their targeting for proteasome-dependent degradation by
the E3 ubiquitin ligases SIAH1 (602212) and SIAH2 (602213) under hypoxia
conditions. Siah2-null mouse fibroblasts exhibited prolonged Phd3
half-life, resulting in lower levels of Hif1a expression during hypoxia.
Hypoxia-induced Hif1a expression was completely inhibited in
Siah1a/Siah2-null cells, yet could be rescued upon inhibition of Phd3 by
RNA interference. In 293T cells, SIAH2 targeting of PHD3 for degradation
increased upon exposure to even mild hypoxic conditions, which coincided
with increased SIAH2 transcription. Siah2-null mice subjected to hypoxia
displayed an impaired hyperpneic respiratory response and reduced levels
of hemoglobin. Nakayama et al. (2004) concluded that control of PHD1 and
PHD3 by SIAH1 and SIAH2 constitutes another level of complexity in the
regulation of HIF1A during hypoxia.

Minamishima and Kaelin (2010) showed that loss of all 3 PHDs (PHD1;
PHD2, 606425; and PHD3, 606426) in the liver dramatically increased EPO
(133170) and hematocrit values to concentrations vastly in excess of
those achieved after renal PHD2 inactivation. Minamishima and Kaelin
(2010) found that PHD2 inactivation is sufficient to induce near maximal
renal EPO production, whereas inactivation of all 3 PHDs is needed to
reactivate hepatic EPO production.

ANIMAL MODEL

HIF prolyl hydroxylases are oxygen sensors that regulate the stability
of the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) in an oxygen-dependent manner.
Aragones et al. (2008) showed that loss of Phd1 expression in knockout
mice lowers oxygen consumption in skeletal muscle by reprogramming
glucose metabolism from oxidative to more anaerobic ATP production
through activation of a PPAR-alpha (170998) pathway. This metabolic
adaptation to oxygen conservation impairs oxidative muscle performance
in healthy conditions, but it provides acute protection of myofibers
against lethal ischemia. Hypoxia tolerance is due to reduced generation
of oxidative stress, which allows Phd1-deficient myofibers to preserve
mitochondrial respiration. Of medical importance, conditional knockdown
of Phd1 also rapidly induces hypoxia tolerance. These findings delineate
a new role of Phd1 in hypoxia tolerance and offer new treatment
perspectives for disorders characterized by oxidative stress.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the EGLN2 gene to chromosome 19q13.2 based on an
alignment of the EGLN2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AJ310544) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

603801	TITLE *603801 N-MYRISTOYLTRANSFERASE 2; NMT2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

N-myristoyltransferase (NMT; EC 2.3.1.97) catalyzes the transfer of
myristic acid from myristoyl coenzyme A to the amino group of a
protein's N-terminal glycine residue. See NMT1 (160993).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences related to NMT1, Giang and
Cravatt (1998) identified human cDNAs encoding NMT1 and a distinct
enzyme, NMT2. They also isolated and characterized the respective mouse
homologs, Nmt1 and Nmt2. The predicted 498-amino acid human NMT2 protein
shares 77% and 96% sequence identity with human NMT1 and mouse Nmt2,
respectively. On Western blots of extracts of mammalian cells expressing
NMT2, the enzyme had an apparent molecular weight of 65 kD. Northern
blot analysis revealed that NMT1 and NMT2 are expressed in most human
and mouse tissues.

CYTOGENETICS

In a Caucasian male with hypogonadism and testicular atrophy (241100),
Quintero-Rivera et al. (2007) identified an apparently balanced
translocation t(8;10)(p11.2;p13), which was also found in his mother and
maternal grandmother. There were no known genes disrupted by the 8p11
breakpoint; however, FISH mapping with overlapping BAC clones of the
10p13 breakpoint demonstrated disruption of the NMT2 gene between exons
1 and 3. The authors suggested that dysfunctional N-myristolylation is a
possible mechanism for testicular failure, either directly or in concert
with viral insults.

612234	TITLE *612234 CALCIUM HOMEOSTASIS MODULATOR 1; CALHM1
;;FAMILY WITH SEQUENCE SIMILARITY 26, MEMBER C; FAM26C
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CALHM1 is a cerebral Ca(2+) channel that controls processing of
amyloid-beta (A-beta) precursor protein (APP; 104760)
(Dreses-Werringloer et al., 2008).

CLONING

Using a bioinformatic strategy to screen for hippocampus-expressed genes
located in Alzheimer disease (AD; 104300) linkage regions,
Dreses-Werringloer et al. (2008) identified CALHM1, which maps to the
AD6 region (605526) on chromosome 10. The deduced 346-amino acid CALHM1
protein contains a hydrophobic loop that does not cross the membrane, 3
transmembrane segments, and 2 putative N-glycosylation sites. RT-PCR
detected highest CALHM1 expression in whole adult brain, spinal cord,
and all adult brain regions examined, with much lower expression in all
other tissues examined, including fetal brain. Immunohistochemical
analysis revealed that CALHM1 localized to the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) and plasma membrane in transfected cells. Western blot analysis of
transfected cells showed 2 CALHM1 bands around 40 kD, and glycosidase
treatment revealed that the upper band represented the fully
glycosylated form. Mutation analysis showed that asn140 was the
glycosylated residue, and it was predicted to be oriented on the luminal
side when CALHM1 is in the ER membrane and in the extracellular space
when CALHM1 reaches the plasma membrane. In the absence of reducing
agents, CALHM1 proteins appeared to migrate as dimers and tetramers, and
immunoprecipitation analysis showed that CALHM1 homomultimerized to form
dimers and possibly tetramers. Dreses-Werringloer et al. (2008)
identified CALHM1 orthologs in all 20 species examined, including mouse
and C. elegans.

GENE FUNCTION

Dreses-Werringloer et al. (2008) found that CALHM1 had properties of an
ion channel and controlled cytosolic Ca(2+) concentrations following
expression in mammalian cells and Xenopus oocytes. AD is characterized
by the presence of cerebral senile plaques composed of aggregated A-beta
peptides generated by proteolysis of APP. Dreses-Werringloer et al.
(2008) found that CALHM1 decreased total extracellular accumulation of
A-beta peptides, including the pathogenic peptides A-beta-40 and
A-beta-42, in APP-expressing mouse neuroblastoma cells that had been
exposed to Ca(2+) depletion followed by Ca(2+) add back. Inhibition of
endogenous CALHM1 expression by RNA interference led to significantly
increased A-beta levels in differentiated human neuroblastoma cells
after Ca(2+) add back. Dreses-Werringloer et al. (2008) concluded that
CALHM1 controls APP proteolysis in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner.

Taruno et al. (2013) demonstrated that CALHM1, a voltage-gated ion
channel, is indispensable for taste stimuli-evoked ATP release from
sweet-, bitter-, and umami-sensing taste bud cells. Calhm1 knockout mice
have severely impaired perceptions of sweet, bitter, and umami
compounds, whereas their recognition of sour and salty tastes remains
mostly normal. Calhm1 deficiency affects taste perception without
interfering with taste cell development or integrity. CALHM1 is
expressed specifically in sweet/bitter/umami-sensing type II taste buds.
Its heterologous expression induces a novel ATP permeability that
releases ATP from cells in response to manipulations that activate the
CALHM1 ion channel. Knockout of Calhm1 strongly reduces voltage-gated
currents in type II cells and taste-evoked ATP release from taste buds
without affecting the excitability of taste cells by taste stimuli.
Thus, Taruno et al. (2013) concluded that CALHM1 is a voltage-gated
ATP-release channel required for sweet, bitter, and umami taste
perception.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Dreses-Werringloer et al. (2008) mapped
the CALHM1 gene to chromosome 10q24.33.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Dreses-Werringloer et al. (2008) identified the CALHM1 gene within the
AD6 (605526) region on chromosome 10q24. They identified a 394C-T SNP
(dbSNP rs2986017) in the CALHM1 gene, resulting in a pro86-to-leu (P86L)
substitution. In 5 independent case-control populations including a
total of 2,043 patients with late-onset AD and 1,361 controls, the
authors observed an association between the T allele of this SNP and
disease (odds ratio of 1.44, p = 2 x 10(-10)). In vitro functional
expression studies showed that the polymorphic P86L channel exhibited
decreased CALHM1-induced calcium permeability, resulting in decreased
cytosolic calcium levels, as well as impaired ability to inhibit
generation of insoluble beta-amyloid. The findings indicated a role for
calcium signaling in APP processing and suggested that variations in the
CALHM1 gene may influence susceptibility to late-onset AD.

Beecham et al. (2009) were unable to replicate the findings of
Dreses-Werringloer et al. (2008) in a case-control study of 510 patients
with late-onset AD and 524 controls. Beecham et al. (2009) found no
association with dbSNP rs2986017 despite adequate power.

116951	TITLE *116951 CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE 11A; CDK11A
;;CELL DIVISION CYCLE 2-LIKE 2; CDC2L2;;
PITSLRE A
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

While characterizing the structure of the CDC2L1 (CDK11B; 176873)
candidate tumor suppressor gene located on 1p36, Lahti et al. (1994)
identified a highly related gene within a contiguous 100-kb genomic
region. They referred to CDC2L1 as PITSLRE B, following the convention
of naming CDC2-related kinases by the amino acid sequence of the region
corresponding to the conserved CDC2 PSTAIRE box. The related gene was
designated PITSLRE A, or CDC2L2.

Xiang et al. (1994) isolated multiple, alternatively spliced CDC2L2
mRNAs. The CDC2L2 transcripts encode 5 protein isoforms ranging in size
from 65 to 110 kD. The isoforms vary in the length and sequence of their
N-terminal regions; the protein kinase catalytic and C-terminal domains
are identical. All contain a 30-residue acid blob domain comprised
primarily of glutamic acid. The mRNAs encoding the 3 largest isoforms,
CDC2L2 alpha-2-1, -2-2, and -2-3, contain 2 alternative translation
initiation sites separated by 58 amino acids. In vitro translation of
these mRNAs yields the 90- and 110-kD isoforms observed in extracts of
HeLa cells. Subcellular fractionation studies indicated that the 110-kD
isoforms are primarily localized in the nucleus. The 65-kD isoform was
detected only in cells undergoing apoptosis. Using Northern blot
analysis, Xiang et al. (1994) found that the alpha-2 isoforms are
encoded by 3.5- and 3.7-kb mRNAs that are expressed in most human cell
lines and tissues. The mRNA encoding the 65-kD CDC2L2 alpha-1 isoform
had a more restricted expression pattern. The authors also detected an
antisense transcript corresponding to the 5-prime untranslated region of
the alpha-1 mRNA. The antisense and sense transcripts shared the same
expression pattern.

The CDC2L1 and CDC2L2 genes encode almost identical protein kinases of
110 kD that contain at their C termini the open reading frame of a
smaller isoform of 58 kD. Cornelis et al. (2000) found that 2 PITSLRE
protein kinase isoforms, p110 and p58, are translated from a single
transcript by initiation at alternative in-frame AUG codons. p110 is
produced by classic cap-dependent translation, whereas p58 results from
internal initiation of translation controlled by an internal ribosome
entry site (IRES) with unique properties. The IRES element is localized
to the mRNA coding region, and its activity is cell cycle regulated,
permitting translation of p58 in G2/M.

Loyer et al. (2008) stated that both CDC2L2 and CDC2L1 can produce a
third isoform, p46, by caspase-dependent proteolysis of either the p110
or p58 isoforms. By immunofluorescence analysis of several human cell
lines, they detected p110 in both nucleoplasm and nuclear speckles.
Western blot analysis showed robust expression of p110 in several human
cell lines and in activated human peripheral blood cells. Only activated
blood cells expressed p58 and p46. Size exclusion chromatography of HeLa
cells revealed that p110 fractionated with protein complexes of about
170 kD to over 1 MDa.

GENE FUNCTION

Advanced-stage neuroblastoma (256700) and tumor-derived cell lines
consistently contain a deletion of 1 allele of the distal short arm of
chromosome 1. The deletion correlates with enhanced metastatic
potential, suggesting that inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene or
genes on 1p may contribute to the pathogenesis of these tumors. Lahti et
al. (1994) demonstrated that 1 allele of the entire CDC2L gene complex
was either deleted or translocated in 18 of 20 neuroblastoma cell lines
investigated. They suggested that the CDC2L gene complex may harbor 1 or
more tumor suppressor genes affected by chromosome 1p36 modifications in
neuroblastoma.

By immunoprecipitation analysis and protein pull-down assays with human
cell lines, Loyer et al. (2008) found that p110 CDK11 associated with
the alpha and beta isoforms of cyclin L1 (CCNL1; 613384) and L2 (CCNL2;
613482) in a high molecular mass complex that showed splicing activity.
The p58 and p46 CDK11 isoforms interacted more weakly with the cyclin L
alpha isoforms. In vivo splicing assays showed that expression of cyclin
L1-alpha, L1-beta, L2-alpha, or L2-beta and/or p110 CDK11 increased
intron-splicing activity and altered alternative splice-site selection
in a cyclin L1 and L2 isoform- and cell type-specific manner. In
contrast with p110 CDK11, p58 and p46 CDK11 reduced splicing activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gururajan et al. (1998) determined the structure of the 140-kb CDC2L
genomic region. This region consists of 2 identical genomic segments
arranged in a tail-to-tail configuration. Each segment contains a CDC2L
gene linked to an MMP gene. See MMP21 (603320). In each case, the most
widely expressed products of the CDC2L gene are derived from a genomic
region that is composed of 20 exons and spans approximately 20 kb. The
authors reported that only 15 amino acids of the 773-786 residues that
encode the multiple CDC2L isoforms are unique to either CDC2L1 or
CDC2L2.

Feng et al. (2004) found that the promoter region of the CDK11A gene is
CG rich and does not contain TATA and CAAT boxes. They identified 2 ETS1
(164720)-binding sites, a cAMP-responsive element (see CREB1; 123810),
and a TCF11 (NFE2L1; 163260)-binding site. Feng et al. (2004) confirmed
binding of ETS1 and CREB1 to the CDK11A promoter region in vitro and in
vivo.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Lahti et al. (1994) mapped the
CDC2L2 gene to 1p36.3.

HISTORY

Protein kinase p58 (CDC2L1; 176873) is a human cell division control
(CDC)-related molecule that is structurally and functionally related to
p34 (CDC2; 116940). Whereas the p58 gene is located on 1p36, Eipers et
al. (1991) found by mouse-human somatic cell hybrid studies that a
highly related p58 sequence maps to chromosome 15. Subsequently, the
CDC2L2 gene on chromosome 15 was retired by the HUGO Nomenclature
Committee. The designation CDC2L2 represents a gene on 1p36.

Although Lahti et al. (1994) reported that a third gene, PITSLRE C, was
also present in the region of 1p36 containing the PITSLRE A and PITSLRE
B genes, Gururajan et al. (1998) found that PITSLRE C does not exist.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chow and Lee (1996) reported the cDNA sequence of DENN, a novel human
gene that is differentially expressed in normal and neoplastic cells
(hence, the symbol DENN). Northern blot analysis revealed differential
levels of expression of a 6.5-kb DENN transcript in malignant cell lines
compared to normal human tissues, where expression was highest in fetal
brain and kidney and in adult testis, ovary, brain, and heart. In fetal
liver and in several human cancer cell lines, the authors identified
cDNAs representing alternative transcripts of DENN that harbor a
deletion of 129 bp encoding 43 amino acids. Present within the serine-
and leucine-rich DENN gene product is an arginyl-glycyl-aspartic acid
(RGD) cellular adhesion motif and a leucine zipper-like motif.

Using the yeast interaction trap system to identify proteins that
interact with the death domain of the type-1 tumor necrosis factor
receptor (TNFR1; 191190), Schievella et al. (1997) isolated cDNAs
encoding 'MAP kinase-activating death domain' (MADD) protein.
Immunoblotting of immunoprecipitated proteins from various human cell
lines detected an approximately 200-kD MADD protein. The deduced
1,588-amino acid MADD protein contains a C-terminal death domain.

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1997) cloned KIAA0358. The deduced protein
contains 1,581 amino acids and is nearly identical to DENN.

Chow et al. (1998) stated that the DENN and MADD cDNAs and proteins are
virtually identical. From genomic studies, they traced the alternative
splicing of a 129-bp fragment to an alternative 5-prime donor site
involving exon 7. The deduced longer DENN isoform has 1,587 amino acids.
Western blot analysis of human MOLT-4 T-lymphoblastic leukemic cell
proteins detected a doublet consisting of 138- and 142-kD polypeptides.
The authors found the DENN protein concentrated predominantly in the
cytosolic compartment of MOLT-4 cells but was restricted to the nuclear
compartment of PLC/PRF/5 hepatoma cells.

Efimova et al. (2004) identified 7 putative splice variants of MADD:
IG20 full-length (IG20FL), IG20, KIAA0358, MADD (also referred to as
DENN), IG20 short variant-2 (IG20SV2), DENNSV (also referred to as
IG20SV3), and IG20SV4. These variants arise from alternative splicing of
exons 13L, 16, 21, 26, and 34. IG20FL, the longest variant, is encoded
by all 36 exons of the MADD gene. RT-PCR detected variable expression of
IG20, MADD, IG20SV, and DENNSV in all human tissues examined. Expression
of KIAA0358, IG20FL, and IG20SV4 was not observed.

GENE FUNCTION

Schievella et al. (1997) found that the MADD protein associated with
TNFR1 through a death domain-death domain interaction. Overexpression of
MADD activated the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase ERK2 (176948),
and expression of the MADD death domain stimulated both the ERK2 and
JNK1 (601158) MAP kinases and induced the phosphorylation of cytosolic
phospholipase A2 (600522). The authors suggested that MADD links TNFR1
with MAP kinase activation and arachidonic acid release.

Al-Zoubi et al. (2001) showed that HeLa cells permanently transfected
with IG20 or DENNSV were more susceptible or resistant to TNF-alpha
(TNFA; 191160)-induced apoptosis, respectively. All MADD variants tested
could interact with TNFR1 and activate ERK and NF-kappa-B (see 164011).
However, relative to control cells, only those expressing IG20 showed
enhanced TNF-alpha-induced activation of caspase-8 (CASP8; 601763) and
CASP3 (600636). Cowpox virus CrmA, an inhibitor of caspase-induced
apoptosis, inhibited apoptosis when transfected in IG20-expressing HeLa
cells.

Using specific small hairpin RNAs targeted to splice variants of the
MADD gene, Mulherkar et al. (2006) found that knockdown of the MADD
variant resulted in spontaneous apoptosis in HeLa cells and in a human
ovarian carcinoma cell line, and they demonstrated that the MADD variant
alone was necessary and sufficient for cancer cell survival. Mulherkar
et al. (2006) hypothesized that since the MADD variant can bind to death
receptors, it may prevent apoptotic signaling by interfering with death
receptor oligomerization.

Efimova et al. (2004) found that overexpression of DENNSV enhanced cell
replication and resistance to treatment with proapoptotic stimuli. In
contrast, IG20 expression suppressed cell replication and increased
susceptibility to proapoptotic stimuli. Moreover, cells that were
resistant or susceptible to TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis exclusively
expressed endogenous DENNSV and IG20, respectively. Transfection of IG20
in a DENNSV-expressing cell line overrode endogenous DENNSV function and
increased susceptibility to apoptotic stimuli. Dominant-negative
I-kappa-B (see NFKBIA; 164008) reversed the effects of DENNSV, but not
IG20, indicating that DENNSV functions through NF-kappa-B activation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chow et al. (1998) determined that the MADD gene spans at least 28 kb
and contains 15 exons, ranging in size from 73 to 1,230 bp.

Efimova et al. (2004) determined that the MADD gene contains 36 exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1997) mapped the MADD gene
to chromosome 11. Using FISH, Chow et al. (1998) mapped the MADD gene to
chromosome 11p11.2.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ST3GAL3 gene encodes
beta-galactoside-alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase-III, a Golgi resident
membrane protein that forms the sialyl Lewis a (sLe-a) epitope on
glyocoproteins. These glycoproteins form the glycocalyx, composed of
sialic acids that act as key determinants of a variety of cellular
recognition and communication processes (summary by Hu et al., 2011).

CLONING

By screening a human placenta cDNA library with a probe based on the
sialyl motif (a highly conserved region in the catalytic domain of
sialyltransferases), Kitagawa and Paulson (1993) isolated a cDNA
encoding SIAT6, which they termed ST3N (EC 2.4.99.6). The deduced
375-amino acid protein is 97% identical to the rat protein. SDS-PAGE
analysis showed expression of an 80-kD protein having sialyltransferase
activity. Northern blot analysis revealed wide expression of a 2.7-kb
transcript with abundant expression in skeletal muscle and high
expression in fetal tissue but low expression in placenta.

Using Northern blot analysis, Kitagawa and Paulson (1994) evaluated the
differential expression of 5 human sialyltransferase genes in adult and
fetal tissues. A 2.7-kb ST3N transcript was expressed highly in skeletal
muscle and moderately in most other tissues examined. A 3.8-kb
transcript was also expressed in testis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Taniguchi et al. (2003) determined that the 5-prime UTR of the ST3GAL3
gene consists of 2 exons. The 5-prime flanking region of the promoter
lacks canonical TATA or CCAAT boxes, but it contains several putative
transcriptional factor binding sites.

Hu et al. (2011) stated that the ST3GAL3 gene contains 15 exons, 12 of
which are coding exons.

MAPPING

The International RH Mapping Consortium mapped the SIAT6 gene to
chromosome 1 (TMAP stSG22084).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Autosomal Recessive Mental Retardation 12

In affected members of 2 unrelated consanguineous Iranian families with
autosomal recessive nonsyndromic mental retardation-12 (MRT12; 611090),
Hu et al. (2011) used linkage analysis, chromosome sorting, and
next-generation sequencing to identify 2 different homozygous mutations
in the ST3GAL3 gene (A13D, 606494.0001 and D370Y, 606494.0002,
respectively.) Neither mutation affected the highly conserved sialyl
motifs, but rather affected the N-terminal transmembrane domain and
catalytic domain, respectively. In vitro functional expression studies
showed that the mutant proteins were mislocalized to the endoplasmic
reticulum and that one (D370Y) had loss of catalytic activity. The
findings demonstrated a link between the glycoprotein complex,
sialyltransferase activity, and higher cognitive functioning.

- Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy 15

In 4 members of a consanguineous Palestinian family with early infantile
epileptic encephalopathy-15 (EIEE15; 615006), Edvardson et al. (2013)
identified a homozygous mutation in the ST3GAL3 gene (A320P;
606494.0003). The mutation was identified by linkage analysis combined
with whole-exome sequencing of 1 individual and confirmed by Sanger
sequencing. The mutation affected the highly conserved sialyl motif S,
which is crucially involved in binding of both donor and acceptor
substrate. In vitro functional expression studies showed that secretion
of the mutant protein was reduced to 25% of control levels and it had no
detectable enzymatic activity. The phenotype was severe: patients showed
delayed psychomotor development and had onset of refractory infantile
spasms between ages 3 and 7 months associated with hypsarrhythmia on
EEG. Other features included hypotonia, poor eye contact, and inability
to speak or walk, even later in childhood. All were profoundly mentally
retarded. Edvardson et al. (2013) noted that the phenotype was more
severe than that observed by Hu et al. (2011), who had identified
ST3GAL3 mutations outside of the highly conserved and functionally
important sialyl motifs.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MENTAL RETARDATION, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 12
ST3GAL3, ALA13ASP

In affected members of a consanguineous Iranian family with autosomal
recessive mental retardation-12 (MRT12; 611090), previously reported by
Najmabadi et al. (2007), Hu et al. (2011) identified a homozygous 38C-A
transversion in exon 2 of the ST3GAL3 gene, resulting in an ala13-to-asp
(A13D) substitution in the transmembrane domain. The mutation was not
found in 278 copies of chromosome 1 from ethnically matched controls or
in 385 control individuals. In vitro functional expression studies in
murine fibroblasts showed that most of the mutant protein was improperly
localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, preventing the protein from
interacting with its substrates in the Golgi, resulting in a loss of
function. Catalytic activity of the A13D mutant enzyme was similar to
wildtype.

MENTAL RETARDATION, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 12
ST3GAL3, ASP370TYR

In affected members of a consanguineous Iranian family with autosomal
recessive mental retardation-12 (MRT12; 611090), Hu et al. (2011)
identified a homozygous 1108G-T transversion in exon 14 of the ST3GAL3
gene, resulting in an asp370-to-tyr (D370Y) substitution in the
catalytic domain at the C-terminal end of the protein. The mutation was
not found in 278 copies of chromosome 1 from ethnically matched controls
or in 385 control individuals. In vitro functional expression studies in
murine fibroblasts showed that the mutant protein was improperly
localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, preventing the protein from
interacting with its substrates in the Golgi, resulting in a loss of
function. The D370Y mutant protein also showed a complete lack of enzyme
activity. Studies of recombinant proteins in CHO cells indicated that
secretion of the D370Y mutant protein was dramatically reduced compared
to wildtype. Hu et al. (2011) concluded that the mutant protein was
cleared by the endoplasmic reticulum-mediated system, suggesting that
the C terminus is important for the proper folding of functional
ST3GAL3.

EPILEPTIC ENCEPHALOPATHY, EARLY INFANTILE, 15
ST3GAL3, ALA320PRO

In 4 members of a consanguineous Palestinian family with early infantile
epileptic encephalopathy-15 (EIEE15; 615006), Edvardson et al. (2013)
identified a homozygous 958G-C transversion in exon 12 of the ST3GAL3
gene, resulting in an ala320-to-pro (A320P) substitution at a highly
conserved residue in the sialyl motif S. The mutation was identified by
linkage analysis combined with whole-exome sequencing of 1 individual
and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. It segregated with the disorder in
the family and was not found in 123 controls of the same ethnic origin
or in 5,379 control exomes. In vitro functional expression studies
showed that secretion of the mutant protein was reduced to 25% of
control levels and that the protein had no detectable enzymatic
activity.
